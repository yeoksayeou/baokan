<h3>昨晨大和與江華相撞</h3>
<p>兩船均受損壞</p>
<p>已在交涉修理</p>
<p>招商局長江船江華號昨日甫由江南廠修竣甫經駛出船塢即被大達公司通揚班輪大和號撞壞茲將此事詳情分誌如下</p>
<p>被撞情形　江華輪於昨晨九時許自江南船廠開出擬赴金利源碼頭停泊裝貨定今晨上水赴漢乃於九時四十二分行至近大達公司碼頭海軍浮標間正值大達公司揚州班輪大和號進口此際潮流湍急江華船主爲求安全計特先在該處抛錨讓大和輪掉頭不意大和輪於江華左側前部停輪並打快速度之倒車而其船尾乃向江華船頭猛撞時江華已抛停無法再避致遭撞壞</p>
<p>受損狀况　大和輪尾甩入江華船頭來勢旣重致江華損傷甚巨第二層艙木鐵欄桿撞斷二十五尺角鐵撑柱折斷兩根排水汽管亦撞壞兩根下層木欄桿撞斷十五尺撑柱毁兩根舷牆撞破三尺至大和輪以反激力巨大其後船尾亦受重傷計毁壞柚木平盤三角鐵破裂撑柱兩枝亦均折斷在兩輪撞碰之時正值九時四十五分也</p>
<p>入廠修理　出事後大達公司因大和輪有班期關係遂將大和行先拖入船塢修理一面由該公司派員到江華輪中騐看傷壞處後便致函招商局大致謂大和進口江華掉頭兩輪以避讓不及致大和輪爲江華所撞傷江華亦受微損無關重要等語該函措詞似撞輪之責在江華而非大和也</p>
<p>責任問題　江華船主在此事發生後便呈報總局略謂本日（二十八日）晨九時四十二分本輪自江南廠開出至大達碼頭海軍河筒間大和輪順潮進口本船先經抛停俾該大和輪之掉頭得有餘地不料該輪向本船左側前部停抛並打快倒車致將本船撞壞（中略）局中即根據此報告復函大達公司略謂據船長報告云云則撞船之責咎在大和所有敝處江華輪被撞損壞之處應請貴公司負責賠修相應函達至希查照辦理云云此函昨日下午業已發出矣</p>
<p>趕修出口　江華撞損處經招商局派工程師勘騐後以該輪即夜便須出口故先行雇工到船上緊修理免誤班期一面將修理費用再行開列細數以便向大達索取至大和輪亦在趕修中可不致脫班</p>
<p>江海關</p>
<h3>不准商貨運往葫蘆島</h3>

<h3>屠宰稅解决後餘聞</h3>
<p>衛生局之糾正　前日各報所載肉商開市新聞一則内有要求取消技士檢騐費云云查檢騐宰牲以杜瘟病畜肉係爲維護公共衛生起見本局辦理此項公務前經規劃於市内各適中地點分别指定多處集中宰牲以便檢騐而節開支所有指定處所之辦公費原訂請由市庫開支嗣據江灣區各肉店呈請免併他區宰騐願由各肉店共担檢騐辦公費請予專派獸醫前往就地檢騐等情奉市政府核准有案嗣據眞茹蒲淞法華洋涇塘橋高橋殷行等區肉商援照江灣區呈准先例請求准繳檢騐辦公費用派員前往就近檢騐等情經本局據情呈請市政府核准後始准照繳完全係抵支檢騐處辦公各費故此項費用係由各該區肉商請予就地設置宰牲檢騐辦公處而增之費用且係呈經核准後始准繳納正名定義實係各該處肉店爲欲自己便利而認出之宰牲檢騐處辦公費不能稱爲技士騐費報載名稱及事實殊與成案不符亟應糾正以正聽聞而明眞相至此項辦公之必需費用在未籌定抵補辦法以前爲維持事業之進行計尙難遽行取消應候市政府核定施行</p>
<p>購稅票之手續　昨有人向市財政局詢問購領屠宰稅票手續嗣據財局職員答稱屠宰稅票性質與印花相同可由各肉商隨時向各稽徵處購領無論整本或零張均可祇須騐明係本局發出者便無貽誤矣</p>
<h3>猪隻宰前檢騐費</h3>
<p>六月一日起由財局直接徵收</p>
<p>上海市衛生財政兩局昨發會銜布告云查市區運往租界猪隻歷由本衛生局施行宰前檢每猪一頭徵收檢騐費大洋一角此項費欵前准肉商代表張寳坤承受認繳現查該商認辦期限至本年五月底屆滿業經本局等呈奉市政府核准自六月一日起改由本財政局直接徵收不再招商認辦凡運往租界猪隻每頭仍收宰前檢騐費大洋一角未經購領收費證者不給騐單云</p>
<h3>請撤縣屠宰稅認商</h3>
<p>縣府批令未准</p>
<p>上海縣閔行商會頃據醃鮮同業公會函稱本縣屠宰稅向由同業香雪堂認包全年稅額爲二千八百六十元江蘇敎育經費今以四千元爲底額招商投標而王守梅竟以四千五百十六元六角六分得標承包再加附稅八百十二元九角九分九釐較之原額幾及一倍且王爲業外之人際此各鄉農民歲收荒歉營業清淡而王以巨數標價投得將來萬一收不足數勢必暴微苛歛</p>

<p>調解結果　主席以雙方談話頗欠接近當席難得圓滿解决辦法遂將本案結束謂完納碼頭捐繳付責任係屬客家原無異議惟客家以人地生疏不得不委託第三者代勞現棉布業與報關業雙方均以種種困難不願代辦當不能相强現擬有二項辦法（一）各代表回去後加以考慮於一星期内三方協商有無結果再行報會辦理（二）將此次調解情形呈復社會局結果各代表以所爭持者惟棉布業與報關業代客盡完納義務一點尙有共同情商之餘地當一致主張採用第一項辦法旋即宣告本日調解暫告結束</p>

<h3>黄海環遊記（一六）</h3>
<p>— 黃炎培</p>
<p>有一位朋友就任浙江某縣的縣長來要我給他幾句話我就老不客氣地說了一大篇官有三種第一種呌做「官」第二種呌做「官官」第三種呌做「民官」</p>
<p>什麽呌「官」呢「這個人官氣十足」「恭喜你升官發財」怕是左宗棠說的罷「你這個人難道理官都不會做麽」這就呌做「官」到處都是不用說的了</p>
<p>什麽呌做「官官」呢那就高一等了他很想替官家辦事也許很會替官家辦事官家應有的權一件一件收過來官家應有的錢一文一文收過來不一定應有只須官的權力所能拿到的老實不客氣要一網包收過來他是官國的忠臣他是官家的忠僕他的心中目中只有一個民府因爲他是官家的官所以叫做「官官」</p>
<p>至於第三種民官那大不同了他的心中目中只有老百姓只曉得替老百姓辦事所以前一種該稱官僕而他纔該稱公僕前一種該稱官官而他纔該稱民官</p>
<p>你當然不去做「官」了可是你去做「官官」呢還是「民官」呢請你老兄自擇這都是對我朋友說的話</p>
<p>到了日本一看他們官塲的辦事倒有第四種官出現了就呌做「國民」他們完全替國家做事郤不是官僕也不配稱公僕只合呌做「國僕」</p>
<p>他們文武百官的辦公桌旁邊都掛着滿蒙新地圖一大幅他們當靜默幾分鐘的時候都在那　想滿蒙呀是吾們國家未來的呀</p>
<p>街道的兩旁電車公共汽車的入口很大很大的高揚着廣告「鐵道局發起滿蒙參觀團那一天出發那一天回來經過什麽什麽地方車價打多少折扣還有什麽仐優待以多少人爲限快快報名」這是常有的事不是偶然的事</p>
<p>「滿蒙事情講演會講題（一）從滿蒙資源上觀察大豆（二）滿蒙的重要與日本的外交發起者某會後援者某官廳」這是我在鄉村襄見到的</p>
<p>電車安全運動到了全國大大的廣告貼起來「四月二十日至二十六日爲電車安全期間絶對不許有事故發生希望全體職員一致努力發起者交通行政官廳」這是吾們國家的權利關頭呀這是吾們國家的榮譽關頭呀一班國官都在那裏想像吾們的行政機關官務太忙了那裏管得到這種國家的閒事</p>

<h3>未來世界（二）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>第一次改把螢石和硫酸來薰做毛玻璃可是容易齷龊刷洗費事第二次把螢石和骨灰來燒做不透明的乳白磁色可是仍易齷龊而且像個麵包司務一般也不美覯最第称把養化鈷加將進去做成不透明的藍色才覺滿意比着陰丹士林染的還漂亮呢至於成本代價可謂廉極每一甏的玻料不過十二元可有四百磅重每磅不過四分比紙價還要便宜我起初還用棉子殻代煤及至做出了一大批的鉀玻璃又做了一　鉛玻璃我就先用壓機壓成了圓桌面一般的凸玻璃利用日光攝取太陽光熱來燒玻璃可就不費一錢因爲軟玻璃絲做的衣服很不容易破爛如果破壞了只消重行回爐不必再要炭酸鉀了所以棉子殻也歸淘汰而且我是不喜歡應酬交際的不用常換什麽行頭所以連着坩鍋壓機凸鏡等等也歸淘汰無用豈不是解决了衣的問題呢至於食的問題我看了五十年後新世界的影片我就把騐方新編卷十六的救飢法查出來一看只用糯米芝蔴紅棗三樣製成丸子每重五錢日服一丸便可一日不飢原來是很便宜的但是要做來吃仍覺費事我就改用抱朴子的方法只在每日黎明把舌尖抵着上齶使得滿口生津徐徐分十數口嚥下一連幾次居然能把飢火下降初則可以廢止朝食漸漸的不論行止坐臥都能嚥這華池津液居然成了道家的服氣習慣也就不食不飢所以不但食的問題解决了而且連飲的問題也就同時解决因此我就胸無渣滓無所用其排洩自來水火以及馬桶尿壶飯碗茶杯等等也就完全歸於淘汰我的住宅因爲省了許多累贅東西而且習慣了靜坐法實行「君子入晏息」的規矩也就不用床榻並不是打坐也不是單趺雙趺的坐法隨隨便便的曲肱而枕隠几而臥都能夠養息精神眞個和龍馬一般而且還比龍馬的精神要好那龍馬雖然不會合眼渴睡然而還要打一個滾呢我却不用打滾只消養息一會就好所以住屋裏面只有一几一椅便足容身方丈之室已覺大而無當其實祗要一席之地夠了起初我想造一個空中樓閣因爲要等五十年後方有空中警察就怕飛機來撞倒我我想飛機撞了沙船的桅桿飛機就會壞了沙船却不會翻身不如以船爲家所以我就把一個躉船做了基地三面都用玻璃窗戶一面却用鎂四門汀砌做磚墻上面用百葉窗來代了椽瓦遇雨則閉要風則開在那春秋佳日實在有趣極了張志和的浮家泛宅原是好法子呢</p>

<h3>人見絹枝與婚姻問題</h3>
<p>— 富蘭</p>
<p>說起日本人見絹枝娘的大名眞是如雷灌耳全世界大都知道不料昨天路透社東京來電說她害着很重的腦膜炎即使她痊愈之後恐怕要迫她不再積極參加運動因爲她虚弱的健康力難勝任這段消息料必引起大衆的注意與惋惜</p>
<p>但是人見娘目下更有一椿切身的終身大事没有解决也許因此减少對於運動的興味她今年已是二十五歲了這個年齡在日本的婦女處此如果還没有獲到丈夫就要開始發生焦慮了這種情形人見娘在大阪出版的「婦女的新社會五月號中曾做有一篇文章也很忠實地承認</p>
<p>在這篇文章裏人見娘自說若單只爲了二十五歲已到的一椿事情還不足使她焦慮所最討厭的就是一般好奇的朋友常常提出問題向她聒絮引起她的煩惱她說「時常有人問我什麽時候預備結婚我的回答就是我不知道四字也許决不結婚雖則我要保留這個意思因爲一當我成爲眞正的老處女的時候或者我要改變我的宗旨那時有些人必定記得我此時所說的言語便要暗地裏笑我了」</p>
<p>往日人見娘的一般朋友和羨慕她的人每次相逢最主要的問訊就是「你每天運動嗎」「你預備在下次世界運動大會裏打破什麽記錄」但是到了最近這些問題都丢棄了代之以「你目下還在運動嗎」及「但是知然啦你要考慮着結婚了對不對」</p>
<p>人見娘在這篇文章裏又說「一般前輩們時時勸我開始考量結婚但是我常常忠實地問我自己是否我的賦性宜於結婚結婚是自尋煩惱因爲有時能使人愚笨掠奪他們進取的精神像這種的結婚狀態我不願去考量　只是我時常給人們拿進個問題來勸我也有些人竟拿話來譏笑我說我是一位體育名家一遇着發火的時候要拿丈夫來出氣着手痛韃丈夫但是我决不想到如此因爲我的心腸並不狠至於我賽跑時候的一副兇獰面孔那是不相干的</p>
<p>「所以抛去結婚的念頭我想尋些我所能做的事情來做做假使我把考慮結婚的時間發展到我的工作上去當然我可以有大部分的成就了」</p>
<p>人見絹枝娘前後到過歐洲出席競賽三次得到不少國際的婦女錦標其中最著名的像在一九二九年中的二百米（二十四秒又十分之七）以及一九二八年的四百米（五十九秒）都是她所創的女子記錄</p>
<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>德軍攻擊的暫時挫折及沙姆河之南聨軍的增援所造成的形勢加以考察更於有關敵方的情報加以研究所得的結論如下</p>
<p>（一）被阻於疴亞斯河及阿拉斯之間的敵人或能舉行再攻他的再攻在沙姆河之南不無困難但在沙姆河之北較易着手因在沙姆河及阿拉斯之間應佈置特别强固的防綫這是英軍總司令部所擔負的工作集合在蒲伐亞區域的法國後備軍應當能夠開到沙姆河之北作戰運輸軍隊的手續必須預先佈置這是法軍總司令部的問題</p>
<p>（二）不管德軍的戰略如何我軍當在沙姆之南趕快先發制人以便把敵人從巴黎亞眠鐵路及亞眠鐵路中心擊退因爲這兩處對於我軍的交通及接濟極關重要根據這個方針軍法以逐敵至勞意爲目標應即在孟鐵第歐區域採取攻擊勢英軍以解除亞眠的危險爲目標當在沙姆河的兩面同時進攻</p>
<p>聨軍從此改取攻勢三月二十一日以來的完全消極態度及爲時勢逼成的固防工作至此告一段落而代以積極的攻勢</p>
<p>現在計劃攻勢戰鼓勵士卒指揮戰事督促兩總司邻調度一切分配兵力杜倫協定所給我的權力顯然不足即在指揮現在攻勢戰巳覺捉襟見肘不久美軍參戰我的責任須處置聨軍作戰的調度根據環境决定各軍攻擊的價標分配攻守的工作以及法意兩軍前敵兵士的交替我的職權一定更感拮据</p>
<p>調節者的簡單的任務對於舉行在即的更大的計劃决不濟事假使他要敏疾的有力的反抗守勢戰所發生的意外事變或者大舉進攻他很少廻旋的餘地他的任務應當改爲指揮的任務假使杜倫會議因在相信任而産生這聨軍機關其權力應當立即加以擴張而委以指揮西綫戰事的全權承認其職權高於聨軍各總司令自北海以至亞德里亞海的前敵軍隊須完全歸其節制</p>
<p>幾天的經騐已足表曝杜倫協定的缺點聨軍現在及將來的利益急不容緩的須要修正這個協定我因根據此意向法國務總理提出這問題並請求三月二十六日英法政府關於我的决議加以補充克萊孟校君在四月一日同我討論此事並决定再召集一次新會議他因請美英法三國代表出席這次會議兩天之後四月三日在蒲伐亞市政廳舉行議决如下</p>
<p>「英法美政府委任福煦將軍調度西綫聨軍的戰事並授與指揮戰事全權」（未完）</p>

<h3>Chiang's Statement to Sun Fo</h3>
<h3>Dares Not Abandon Responsibility</h3>
<p>Refutes Sun Fo's Telegram</p>
<p>Still Hopes to Mediate the Overall Situation</p>
<p>On the 25th, the Nanjing and Guangzhou sides issued a telegram led by Tang Shaoyi, demanding that Chairman Chiang step down within 48 hours. At the same time, Sun Zhesheng (Sun Fo) sent another telegram to Chairman Chiang, echoing this proposal. Chairman Chiang believed that the telegram from Tang and others did not require a reply, and yesterday specifically replied to Sun with a telegram. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangzhou, Brother Sun Zhesheng:</p>
<p>I have just read your telegram echoing Mr. Tang Shaochuan (Tang Shaoyi) and Wang Jingwei, desiring that Zhongzheng (Chiang's given name) abandon the responsibilities entrusted to him by the Party and the nation at a moment's notice. I am surprised and deeply saddened. Zhongzheng has devoted himself to the revolution, entrusted by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. The positions he holds are all by order of the Party and the nation. Neither Zhao Mengfu (a renowned painter and official of the Yuan dynasty, meaning not something that can be easily given or taken away) nor anyone else can elevate or demean him. If you believe that Zhongzheng has failed the Premier's trust, you should suggest his dismissal to the Party through legal procedures to atone to the Party and the nation. If the Party decides to dismiss Zhongzheng, Zhongzheng will not dare to cling to his position for a moment. Instead, you willingly allow yourself to be exploited by reactionary elements and communists who are accustomed to creating chaos, intending to disrupt peace and unity, to coerce Zhongzheng. Zhongzheng's personal advancement or retreat is not important; what about the principles of the Party and the nation? As for the accusation that Zhongzheng acts arbitrarily in political affairs, I do not know what you are referring to. In recent years, all major reforms in the country have been ordered by the Party, and none has not been jointly advocated by you and others. You participated in these matters before, but now suddenly criticize them afterward, as if you were two different people. It is truly strange. If you believe that past events should be changed, you can amend them through legal procedures. Who dares to disobey the Party's orders? As for Mr. Tang Shaochuan and others, I do not know by what qualifications they demand Zhongzheng's dismissal. I can only smile and ignore it. However, I remember that you are the Premier's son, and when you went to Guangdong, you stated to Mr. Wu, Li, Cai, Zhang, and others that your goal was to mediate and reconcile. Now that you have arrived in Guangzhou, you have sent this telegram. I suspect that you are under pressure from the environment and that this is not your true intention. I deeply remember that the revolution has not yet succeeded, and comrades must continue to work hard. I firmly believe that revolution is a responsibility, not a right. Usurpation is not allowed, and abandonment is not dared. I still hope that you will consider the Premier's difficulties in starting the cause and the efforts of comrades in their struggles. Uphold the legacy of peace and unity, maintain the original intention of mediation and reconciliation in Shanghai, and continue to work together to complete the revolution. I hope you will not be tempted for a moment and go astray, causing joy to the enemies and pain to our loved ones. I offer this sincere reply, hoping for your careful consideration.</p>

<h3>International Conference on Limiting the Manufacture of Toxic Substances</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Countries in the world are enthusiastic about addressing issues that pose a direct threat to their own interests. For example, countries are making every effort to address domestic economic decline and trade stagnation. Today, the United States is holding a national foreign trade conference where representatives can come together to explore the root causes of these problems. This is one example. However, when it comes to problems that are a common global threat, or those that do not pose a direct threat to one's own interests, countries may pay lip service to international cooperation while acting disingenuously. Agreements may be reached on the surface, but opinions may diverge even before progress is made. The silver conference is a case in point, where all countries expressed support but none were willing to take the initiative.</p>
<p>Nanjing, The manufacture of toxic substances such as opium, morphine, and heroin has been increasing in recent years, causing increasing harm to the world. In our own country, cases of trafficking in these substances are constantly being uncovered. Can it be that countries that advocate for humanitarianism are unaware of this? Yet we have not heard of any domestic measures taken by these countries to address the issue. According to reports, the main manufacturing countries in the world are the Netherlands, France, Germany, Switzerland, Turkey, and Japan. If these six manufacturing countries were truly sincere in preventing the harm caused by toxic substances to the world, they should have taken the initiative to limit their manufacture. Today, there are 51 countries represented at the Geneva Conference on Limiting the Manufacture of Toxic Substances. Among these 51 countries, those that manufacture large quantities of toxic substances will surely try to conceal their activities and avoid easy discussion of limitations. Those that do not suffer greatly from the harm caused by toxic substances will likely take a bystander's attitude, considering it to be none of their business. If only a few countries that suffer greatly from the harm caused by toxic substances are actively involved in international conferences, the outcome of the conferences can be imagined. Therefore, we hope that the representatives of these 51 countries will work together sincerely and make vigorous efforts to eliminate the harm caused by toxic substances.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Italian Fascist Party Reprimands Students</h3>
<h3>Demonstrating Against the Vatican</h3>
<p>Shouting the Slogan "Down with the Pope"</p>
<p>Many Church Windows Smashed</p>
<p>Authorities Dispatch Troops to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 28th: Because the Fascist Party, which opposes the Catholic Church, has incited riots, all streets leading to the Vatican in Rome are now guarded by Italian soldiers, and important buildings such as Catholic churches are also guarded by police. Many church windows have been smashed by stones. Hundreds of students stormed the Catholic Youth Club, shouting "Down with the Pope" and committing many acts of insult before being driven out by the police. The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano criticized the police for allowing the chaos. It also telegraphed that since the government and the Vatican concluded a treaty in 1929 restoring the Vatican's civil rights, the dispute between the Fascist Party and the Catholic Church has been brewing every day, because the Vatican has always regarded Fascism as only a temporary system. Today's split began with mutual accusations between the Fascist Party newspaper and the Catholic Church's media. The newspaper accused the church of meddling and interfering in politics and encroaching on the Fascist Party's position, while the church accused the newspaper of deliberately spreading rumors. Recently, many Catholic students met with the Pope to complain about mistreatment. The Pope replied that if they were expelled from the Fascist Party because they belonged to the church, they should regard it as an honor. The editor of L'Osservatore Romano, Tolle, recently suggested opening four influential daily newspapers to counter Italian newspapers that are detrimental [to the Church]. Today it is said that someone is planning to kidnap the editor, but this has not been confirmed. The Fascist Party headquarters issued a statement denying that there is any irreconcilable conflict between the Fascist Party and the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Rome, 28th: A serious conflict has suddenly arisen between the Italian Fascist Party and the Catholic Church. The Vatican has issued a semi-official statement stating that in recent weeks, the Italian authorities should be held responsible for the violent acts of the Fascist Party against the church and clergy everywhere. It has been reported that Fascist Party students in Venice, Milan, and other cities have smashed countless church buildings and broken the glass on the papal emblems. This morning, the Italian authorities dispatched a large number of soldiers to patrol the borders of the Papal States to prevent students in the Italian capital from disturbing order. However, the students are now holding meetings in front of the university with sticks and other weapons, apparently intending to stage another demonstration against the Vatican.</p>
<h3>Italy Expands Navy</h3>
<p>Budget Increased by 90 Million Lire</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Rome, 29th: The Italian Parliament today passed the naval budget for 1931-32, totaling 1,575,000,000 lire, an increase of 90,000,000 lire over the previous year. The Minister of the Navy claimed that Italy hopes for the establishment of the Three-Power Naval Treaty, but the Ministry of the Navy wants to prepare for any eventuality. Half of the increased amount in the new budget will be used to build new ships. The plan is to build three 10,000-ton cruisers, four 5,000-ton cruisers, several torpedo destroyers, and submarines. The Minister of the Navy also repeatedly stated that Italy, like Britain, believes that the Three-Power Naval Treaty should strictly limit the shipbuilding of France, Italy, and Britain until 1936.</p>
<h3>New Polish Cabinet Formed</h3>
<p>Pieracki Appointed Premier</p>
<p>No Major Changes in Cabinet Members</p>
<p>Policies Remain the Same</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Warsaw, 27th: After a long talk with President Moscicki today, Pieracki, the former Minister of the Interior in the Slawek Cabinet, has agreed to accept the mandate to form a new cabinet. It is said that Pieracki is the most trusted person of former Prime Minister General Piłsudski, and his appointment to form the cabinet this time is also due to Piłsudski's behind-the-scenes control. As for its general policies, they are roughly the same as those adopted by the previous cabinet.</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Warsaw, 27th: Colonel Pieracki today submitted the list of the new Polish cabinet. Compared with the old Slawek cabinet, only three people have been replaced. Pieracki was replaced as Prime Minister, General Sarzecki was appointed as Minister of Transport, and Tadeusz Piłsudski, the younger brother of Marshal Piłsudski, was appointed as Minister of Finance. The rest of the members remained in their original positions.</p>
<h3>US-Austrian Trade Agreement Signed</h3>
<p>US Attitude towards the German-Austrian Customs Union</p>
<p>Worthy of Great Attention</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 27th: The State Department stated that the US and Austria have signed a trade agreement containing provisions for mutual most-favored-nation treatment. Since the US has established trade agreements with both Germany and Austria, the US attitude towards the German-Austrian customs union is worthy of great attention. If, according to the most-favored-nation treatment provisions, the goods exported by the US do not receive equal benefits, then Washington may oppose this union. However, the State Department has not yet decided whether the US-Austrian trade agreement allows the US to demand such benefits.</p>
<h3>Balloon Lands on Ice Field</h3>
<p>Stayed in the Air Longer Than Expected</p>
<p>Oxygen Supply Likely Exhausted</p>
<p>Piccard's Safety a Concern</p>
<p>Reuters, Swiss Capital, 28th: The Swiss Aviation Administration received a phone call stating that Professor Piccard and his companion's balloon had landed on the ice field of Mount Wasser Alpe.</p>
<p>Reuters, Innsbruck, 27th: It is reported that Professor Piccard and his companion, who ascended in a balloon, have sent out a distress signal, so their safety is a great concern. Today, the balloon swayed in the air over Tyrol, Austria, all day and then seemed to be landing towards Vienna. The police have rushed there by car to provide any needed assistance. Professor Piccard originally intended to fly to a height of ten miles and estimated that it would land within seven hours. His oxygen supply is only enough to last for ten hours. It is now known that the two adventurers are carrying three parachutes, two to release measuring instruments and one for the two to use to descend.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th: Professor Piccard's balloon has not yet landed. The oxygen supply can only last for ten hours, and it is feared that this enthusiastic scientist has died in the sky.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th: There is still no news of Professor Piccard and Dr. Kipfer in the balloon this morning. It is likely that they have died. Some say that the cold air at night may have pressed the balloon down and caused it to fall within Tyrol, Austria. However, many scientists say that the oxygen equipment is likely malfunctioning and the two have already suffocated. Last night, a rocket was launched to inquire at the place near Innsbruck where the balloon was spotted, but there was no response, so the suffocation theory seems quite credible. The police, who were following the balloon in a self-propelled motor vehicle, lost sight of the balloon in the dark and flew into the sky, intending to find out the fate of the two. An airplane was also forced to fly back due to the dark weather.</p>
<h3>Conference on Limiting the Manufacture of Narcotics</h3>
<p>Representatives from 51 Countries Attending</p>
<p>Discussing Draft International Convention</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Geneva, 27th: The International Conference on Limiting the Manufacture of Narcotics opened here today. Representatives from 51 countries, including China, Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Canada, Cuba, Egypt, Mexico, Siam, Uruguay, and Venezuela, attended. Belgian Senator Brooke is the chairman. This conference will discuss the draft international convention on limiting narcotics prepared by the League of Nations' Opium Committee. The convention stipulates three main points: (1) Each country should publish its domestic legal needs five months in advance. (2) The world's narcotics production should be limited to meet these legal needs. (3) The producing countries should determine the amount of production that each will be permitted in advance. The world's major producing countries are currently the Netherlands, France, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, and Turkey. Last October, the conference in London attempted to determine the production quota for these countries but failed to reach an agreement. The main reason for the failure was that Turkey requested to produce about one-third of the world's legal narcotics needs. If these six countries can agree to limit the production quota based on the actual needs of medicine and science, and stipulate the amount of production that each country should obtain, then it will not be difficult to get the other non-narcotics-producing countries to accept this convention.</p>
<h3>American Foreign Trade Conference</h3>
<p>Farrington Stresses the Inappropriateness of Excluding Orientals</p>
<p>National Press Agency, New York, 27th: The 18th National Foreign Trade Conference was held here today. More than 2,000 representatives attended. The president of US Steel Corporation, Farrell, presided over the meeting. Farrell delivered the opening speech, stating that the current economic decline in the United States is not entirely due to the high tax rate in the United States. We should now find other reasons. Farrell also advocated raising prices to encourage purchases. Other speakers included Farrington, the publisher of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. Farrington said that the inequality of the United States' immigration laws should be corrected, and the exclusion of Orientals is enough to cause resentment against the United States, hindering the sales of American goods. It must be known that Orientals are no longer as ignorant as they used to be. In addition, the low silver price should also be remedied as soon as possible. In addition, the shipping industry should be promoted and electricity fees should be reduced.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Peers Discusses Salary Reduction Trend</h3>
<p>Obstacles to Future Administrative Reorganization</p>
<p>Bad Habits of Officials Must Not Be Tolerated</p>
<p>Business Operations of Stores Already Affected by Salary Reduction</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: The House of Peers' criticism of the process and results of the salary reduction plan is as follows, believing that it will make the government's future even gloomier: (1) As long as the government's policies are opposed by the masses, this bad habit of officials can be alleviated and will remain in the officialdom forever. (2) The Wakatsuki cabinet cannot be expected to implement administrative reorganization in the future. (3) The popularity of the Seiyukai Party in the cities has been completely lost due to this, which will make the government's future increasingly bleak.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: The salary reduction for officials will be implemented from June 1st. Its impact has spread to all aspects. For example, the number of viewers in Asakusa cinemas has decreased by 20%. Also, the sales of bookstores in Kanda Jimbocho have decreased by 20-30% in the past one or two weeks. Many officials have cancelled their reservations for books. There are also Western-style clothing stores that specialize in serving government offices, and they are all asking for extensions of payment dates, all of which are frowning. Although small businesses, like farmers, support the salary reduction for officials, they have a sense of both laughter and tears because their sales have suddenly decreased.</p>

<p>Gong and Guo Divisions</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle to Attack the Bandit Lair in Donggu</h3>
<p>Seizing Three Key Passes at the Gateway to Donggu</p>
<p>Red Bandits Counterattacked and Retreat Back to Ji'an</p>
<p>Gong Bingfan Has Returned to Nanchang to Report</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the Red bandit Peng Dehuai occupied Donggu, the residents within hundreds of miles around the constructed fortifications have been coerced to carry food into the mountains as a strategy of clearing the fields. Commander Gong Bingfan of the 28th Division was ordered to take charge of the main force attacking Donggu from Ji'an. Since the 17th, he led three regiments to attack Jiucun Ridge fiercely. He also sent a regiment to Guanyin Cliff to engage in fierce battles with Peng's bandits for two days and nights, killing many bandits. Later, Guo Huazong's division and Han's brigade joined the battle to assist. The bandit forces could not withstand it and retreated into the Donggu lair. Guanyin Cliff, Yantian Pit, and the key passes of Jiucun Ridge were occupied by Gong's division. Peng's bandits regarded these three key passes as the gateway to Donggu, so they launched a counterattack with all their might. The farmer bandits were in the front, and the gun bandits were in the back, advancing wave upon wave and fighting more and more fiercely. Gong's division was surrounded by bandits because it had penetrated deep into the bandit lair. They charged left and right, suffering considerable losses. Commander Gong was afraid of repeating the same mistakes of the 18th Division and retreated towards Futian. Unexpectedly, the bandits' momentum was fierce and they marched towards Ji'an. At the same time, the two Red bandit forces of Li Mingrui and Zeng Bingchun on the west bank of the Gan River also advanced from Yongxin towards the west of Ji'an, hoping to join forces with Peng's bandits to seize Ji'an. Fortunately, Tang's division in Jishui received the news and immediately sent Zhu's brigade to join the battle to provide support and consolidate the Ji'an defense line. At the same time, Hu Yixi's brigades of Luo's division marched from Taihe to the west of Ji'an, facing Li's bandits on one side and attacking Peng's bandits' waist on the other. The defense of Ji'an City was strictly guarded by Commander Luo and Zhang's brigade of Han's division. Therefore, no matter how many times the bandits charged, the government army's line did not change. The bandits began to be discouraged. Later, Han's division from Anfu and Hao's division from the fifth route reinforced Ji'an. Sun Lianzhong's troops also advanced from Le'an to Ji'an. The military strength was greatly enhanced, and the bandits retreated to Donggu. Yesterday, the 25th, Director He reported during the memorial week at the headquarters that although our army suffered more than 3,000 casualties in the Donggu battle, the number of Red bandits killed was more than 10,000. It is conceivable how fierce the battle was. According to news from the Ji'an postal sector, when Gong's division retreated to Ji'an, the Red bandits once advanced to an area 30 li away from Ji'an City. After Han's division and Hao's division arrived, the situation turned from danger to safety. Commander Gong has retreated to the rear for rest due to heavy losses. Deputy Commander Wang Xiangding of the Sixth Route Army and Commander Gong arrived in the province from Ji'an yesterday to report the battle to Director He. Director He expressed his condolences to Wang and Gong and promised to provide sufficient reinforcements. However, according to Commander Gong's report, the defeat was actually caused by his chief of staff Zhang Minquan's wrong measures and improper deployment. Therefore, Zhang was arrested and handed over to the Public Security Bureau for punishment. In recent days, the Red bandits have been in a stalemate with the government army in the southeast area of Ji'an. Han's and Hao's divisions have replaced Gong's and Guo's divisions in defending the line of Ji'an, Taihe, and Yongfeng. There have been no major battles. However, four aircraft of the 5th Aviation Squadron have been flying to the vicinity of Donggu for bombing operations. According to aviation personnel reports, more than ten bombs were dropped in Donggu today, all hitting and exploding, killing many bandits. (27th)</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Government Reorganized in Compliance with Orders</h3>
<p>New Provincial Committee Scheduled to Take Office on June 1st</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The news about the reorganization of the Hubei Provincial Government has been circulating for a long time but has not been realized. It was not until the State Council held a state affairs meeting on the 26th of this month that a decision was made. He Chengjun will continue to serve as chairman, Liu Wendao will serve as director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wu Guozhen will serve as director of the Department of Finance, Fang Dazhi will continue to concurrently serve as director of the Department of Construction, and Huang Jianzhong will continue to concurrently serve as director of the Department of Education. Zhu Huaibing, Ma Dengying, Peng Jieshi, and Chen Guangzu will serve as committee members. The central government will still appoint former Director of Civil Affairs Wu Xingya as the director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Anhui, former Committee Member Xiong Bingkun will be transferred to serve as a military counselor to the National Government, and Xie Lü will be transferred to serve as a counselor to the Military Council. Wu and others are scheduled to leave Hankou for Beijing within a few days. The members of the provincial party department, representatives from all walks of life, and all staff members of the Department of Civil Affairs are scheduled to hold a farewell meeting for Wu Xingya at the Puhai Chun on the 28th to leave a memento. Except for Chairman He Chengjun, who is staying in Beijing, and Committee Member Ma Dengying, who is in Shashi defending the second front, and Committee Member Zhu Huaibing, who is in Macheng defending the second front, the rest of the new committee members are in Hankou. It is rumored that a swearing-in ceremony will be held on June 1st. The Departments of Civil Affairs and Finance have been rushing to complete the handover in recent days and are very busy. It is expected that the handover will be completed by the end of this month. The reporter interviewed the new Director of Civil Affairs Liu Wendao and the new Director of Finance Wu Guozhen yesterday and had a brief conversation with them. Liu said that he had only seen in the newspaper that he had been appointed as a member of the provincial committee and director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and had not yet received a clear order. He will wait for the central government to issue a clear order and for Chairman He to return to Hubei before he can schedule his inauguration. He cannot talk about the policy direction at the moment. He plans to first investigate the actual situation before determining a plan to proceed. As for the municipal government, it cannot be taken care of at the same time. The central government should have a solution to this, so he is still maintaining the status quo. Wu said that Hubei's finances have reached the point of extreme difficulty. Chairman He is currently discussing this matter with the central government in Beijing. He will discuss the plan with him after Chairman He returns to Hankou, and consider the situation to determine a solution to ensure that revenue and expenditure are balanced. The deficit of more than 2 million yuan in the provincial treasury will also be gradually repaid. (May 27th)</p>
<p>Hankou Headquarters Circular</p>
<h3>Strictly Prevent Red Bandits from Purchasing Weapons in Hankou</h3>
<p>Two Criminals Selling Bullets Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Wuhan Headquarters previously reported that the source of firearms and ammunition for the Red bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi was mostly purchased from the Hankou Concession, and ordered the Detective Office to strictly investigate and arrest them. Recently, the office discovered that a German merchant's foreign company was privately selling 15,000 rounds of ammunition to the Red bandits. It was seized and confiscated, and a protest was lodged with the German Consulate. At the same time, Li Yunheng, commander of the 53rd Division, reported that most of the firearms and ammunition of the Red bandits in Henan Province were also purchased from Hankou, and requested that measures be taken to strictly prevent them from being smuggled out of the country. The Headquarters considered the matter to be of great importance and issued a circular to all troops on the 27th to prevent it, and executed Wang Qingjie, Hu Kaisheng, and other criminals who sold ammunition to support the Red bandits by firing squad on the same day to warn the public. The charges are recorded as follows: (1) Public Notice: According to the Detective Office's transfer of Wang Qingjie, a criminal who sold ammunition to support the Red bandits, for interrogation, the Military Law Department of this Headquarters has determined that the criminal Wang Qingjie directly sold ammunition three times and provided security for Zhang Tuhua of the false provincial committee and Yang Guanghua, who handled the ammunition. The self-confessed persons have identified them one by one, and the criminal has also directly admitted it. Such a willing affiliation with bandits is an unforgivable crime, and it should be punished with the death penalty in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Endangering the Republic of China to warn others. In addition to ordering that the criminal Wang Qingjie be bound and sent to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad, this public notice is hereby issued to inform the public. (2) Public Notice: According to the Detective Office's transfer of Hu Kaisheng and others, criminals who purchased ammunition for the bandits, for interrogation, the Military Law Department of this Headquarters has determined that the criminal Hu Kaisheng confessed that he colluded with Wang Tianhong, a procurer stationed in Hankou for the bandit army in Hanchuan, and entrusted Jiang Haishan to purchase ammunition in succession in the name of the Hanchuan team, and delivered it to the traffic office of the bandit army in Huajing Street. The self-confessed persons have certified it in court, proving that such willing affiliation with bandits is indeed an unforgivable crime and should be punished with the death penalty in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Endangering the Republic of China to warn others. In addition to ordering that the criminal Hu Kaisheng be bound and sent to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad, this public notice is hereby issued to inform all people.

<h3>Suxian County Magistrate Forcibly Levies Opium Tax</h3>
<p>Poisonous Flowers Occupy Two-Thirds of the County's Land</p>
<p>County Magistrate Forces Each District to Pay 300,000 Yuan in Tax</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The counties of Su, Meng, Wo, and Hao in northern Anhui have long been known as the most prominent areas for opium production, exporting no less than several million taels annually, poisoning various provinces and causing endless harm. Among them, Suxian County plants the most. Recently, poppies have flourished and filled the fields. It is estimated that the county has more than 180 villages, and each village plants tens of hectares of opium seedlings. Therefore, poisonous flowers occupy nearly two-thirds of the county's land. This alarming number has aroused the covetousness of the county authorities. Although various districts want to implement eradication, the county government forcibly retains the opium seedlings to apportion the seedling tax. First, they ordered each district to register the acreage and report it to the county government. County Magistrate Wang Xinlan recently convened a meeting of the ten district chiefs in the county government and ordered them to acknowledge and pay 300,000 yuan in opium seedling tax. The district chiefs argued that the county had suffered repeated banditry, war disasters, and the people were impoverished, making it difficult to bear the burden. Because they did not agree, Wang sent teams to monitor them and force them to sign. Yesterday evening (the 26th), the district chiefs took the opportunity to escape from the county government and took the Jinpu express train to Bengbu. This morning (the 27th), they presented a petition to the Northern Anhui Garrison Headquarters, requesting a halt to the tax levy. The Chief of Staff received them and promised to send a telegram to stop it immediately. At 12 o'clock, the district chiefs were hosted by the district party headquarters to meet with the press. Lu Qixun, the district chief of the ninth district, reported the details of the incident, stating that since County Magistrate Wang Xinlan took office last winter, various measures have been out of sync with public opinion. The most prominent is protecting corrupt gentry, shielding communist party members, selling and releasing bandits, banning the eradication of opium seedlings, and harming the people in violation of the law, which is rare among administrative officials. He also said that opium seedlings are the people's lifeblood, and no district is allowed to eradicate them; violators will be shot. Recently, each district chief was forced to acknowledge 300,000 yuan in opium seedling tax, with a deadline for payment. Those who did not agree would be placed under surveillance. Because they were unwilling to sign, they were placed under house arrest and risked escaping yesterday. Wang sent bailiffs to search and arrest them, chasing them to the train station, but they had already boarded the train and were not caught. Fortunately, he also said that in addition to sending telegrams to the central government and the provincial government to state their case, they also planned to go to Beijing tonight to appeal to the central government, and then go to Anqing to request the provincial government to quickly send a telegram to stop the extortion and request Wang's removal and punishment to appease public anger. The telegrams from the district chiefs and district preparatory staff to the central government and the Anhui government are recorded as follows: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Control Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Opium Prohibition Committee, the Anhui Provincial Government, and the Provincial Party Headquarters: Wang Xinlan, the County Magistrate of Suxian County, Anhui Province, has violated the national ban by forcibly retaining opium seedlings, levying a registration fee of 30,000 yuan, and forcing district chiefs and others to acknowledge an opium seedling tax of 300,000 yuan, to be paid by June 15. The county has deducted 10,000 yuan from the public funds paid by each district as a registration fee. The district chiefs and others were forced to secretly leave Suxian and go to Beijing and the province to petition. We hereby telegraph this matter urgently, begging your excellency to quickly send a telegram to stop this in order to maintain the national ban. We await your orders urgently. Respectfully, Li Xinming, District Chief of the First District of Suxian County; Chen Zhujiu, Preparatory Staff of the Second District; Chang Faming, District Chief of the Third District; Zhang Jianxun, District Chief of the Fourth District; Chen Yulun, Preparatory Staff of the Fifth District; Zhou Bingzhi, Preparatory Staff of the Sixth District; Zhong Jincun, Preparatory Staff of the Eighth District; Lu Qixun, District Chief of the Ninth District; Sun Xiaozu, District Chief of the Tenth District. Respectfully kowtow. (27th)"</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Jinbei Mining Bureau</h3>
<p>Currently Has More Than 1,000 Workers</p>
<p>Daily Coal Output Exceeds 300 Tons</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Jinbei Mining Bureau was established in May of the 18th year of the Republic (1929) as a joint public-private enterprise with a fully paid-up capital of 1 million yuan. The general bureau is located in Datong County. The general manager, Dang Gechun, is from Jin County, Shanxi Province, and graduated from Shanxi University and the Mining Department of Waseda University in Japan. The general bureau organization consists of five departments: general affairs, engineering, accounting, business, and road affairs. There are also offices and hospitals in various locations, as well as a mine police management office. The road affairs department has an office in Kouquan, and the engineering department has offices under the two mines, further divided into six sections: well affairs, machinery, materials, surveying and mapping, accounting, and miscellaneous affairs, totaling more than 100 employees. Currently, there are two mining areas: Yongdingzhuang and Meiyukou. The highest authority of the mining bureau is the fundraising committee, which is responsible for supervision and management. The Datong Qingyan coal is hard, dense, has high calorific value, and very little ash and sulfur content. Although it has a small amount of Qingyan, the black smoke does not stick at all, making it ideal for factories and ships. Each mine has two vertical shafts, and coal is extracted in three shifts per day. Each shift has an average of about 400 workers. Currently, due to the shortage of train cars on the PingSui Railway, transportation is extremely difficult, so exports are temporarily restricted, with only 300 tons being produced per day. It is expected that when everything returns to normal and the mines are roughly in place, a daily output of 2,000 tons will not be difficult. The Yongdingzhuang mining area covers more than 89 acres, with two minable coal seams. The first layer is about 180 feet from the surface and about five feet thick. The second layer is about 350 feet from the surface and about eight feet thick. Currently, the first coal seam is being mined. The Meiyukou mine currently has a mining area of about 10 square miles, with two minable coal seams. One is about 300 feet deep and eight feet thick, and the other is about 700 feet deep and ten feet thick. Currently, the first coal seam is also being mined. Underground coal mining uses a contract system. The contract price for digging one foot of the main tunnel is currently 3.1 yuan, and the contract price for digging one foot of the coal cave is currently 2.6 yuan. The main tunnel is about one zhang wide, and the coal cave is about eight chi wide. There are nine types of workers in total, namely: coolies, factory workers, outside factory workers, machinists, carpenters (monthly wages), carpenters (daily wages), road workers, machinery repair factory machinists, road affairs department machinists, and escort coolies. The total number of workers is about 1,000. The highest wage is 48 yuan, and the lowest is 8 yuan. Regarding transportation, Kouquan is 36 li away from Datong. After the PingSui branch line was built in the 7th year of the Republic (1918), it began to transport coal. In addition, there is the Meiquan Railway, which runs from Kouzhen to Meiyukou, and the Yongquan Railway, which runs from Kouquan Town to Yongdingzhuang. Both roads are connected to the Tongquan branch line, making transportation quite convenient. These two roads were built by the Jinbei Mining Bureau itself. The Quanquan Railway is also directly under the jurisdiction of the Jinbei Mining Bureau. It is a small railway with a gauge about one-third smaller than ordinary railway tracks. The carriages and locomotives are also very narrow, and each time it can only transport a maximum of 40 tons of coal, specifically for transporting coal to the surrounding soil kilns. Sales locations include Pingjin, Gu, Hu, Han, Qingdao, Japan, etc. The value per ton varies due to freight and other factors. (May 23)</p>

<h3>Unresolved Case of the Tram Company Resolved</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Passes Five Measures to Terminate the Contract</p>
<p>Establish a Liquidation Committee to Recompense Shareholders' Capital</p>
<p>In the 13th year of the Republic (1924), the Yue Tram Company signed a contract with the government to lay tracks and operate trams in the urban area. At that time, the tram company reported a contribution of 1 million Hong Kong dollars to the government's military expenses. The government then specially granted the company various rights. Subsequently, after repeated political changes, the company also suspended operations due to financial constraints. The Guangzhou Municipal Government recently decided that if the company continued in this way, it would not only hinder the development of road administration, but also greatly damage the company's capital. Therefore, it was decided to send personnel to take over the company and carry out reorganization. Recently, the company's contract was cancelled. The measures for terminating the contract have been approved by the 36th Municipal Administrative Conference. The measures for terminating the tram company's contract are recorded as follows: (1) The 20-year approval period for the company is counted from eight months after September 20, the 13th year of the Republic (1924), which is the date of the order. According to the scheduled deadline, May 20, the 14th year of the Republic (1925), is the deadline. By May 20 of this year, six years have passed. The 1 million Hong Kong dollars that were reported as a contribution to the government should be amortized evenly over 20 years, accounting for 50,000 yuan per year, totaling 300,000 yuan for six years. After the contract is terminated, in addition to deducting the amount, 700,000 yuan should be returned. (2) The case of the company paying interest on the 1 million yuan to the government in installments was jointly reviewed and reported by the Public Works and Utilities Bureaus on November 23 of a certain year of the Republic, stating that the company had not built tram roads for a long time and did not comply with the contract. The government should not deliver the interest on the contribution already paid. This point should not be discussed. (3) The amount to be returned after deducting the contribution after the contract is terminated is quite large. A section of land with a corresponding value in the Haizhu Inner Port should be designated and ordered to be reserved by the Finance Bureau for future investment and compensation. (4) The company's general manager, Wu Yuhan, and supervisor, Wu Jiepan, have already issued resignation reports to the shareholders. In order to protect the rights of the company's shareholders, a liquidation committee should be established immediately to carry out all liquidation work and notify all shareholders to register within a time limit so that funds can be distributed proportionally in the future. (5) The original contract was signed and sealed by the former military governor, the provincial governor, and the former municipal office director. The procedures for terminating the contract should first be submitted to the provincial government for approval before being processed in order to comply with the procedures. (May 23)</p>
<h3>Shenyang City Holds Large-Scale Health Campaign</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Shenyang Municipal Office, in conjunction with various agencies and organizations, held a health campaign conference and established a preparatory committee. Seven meetings were held and it was decided to hold a grand health campaign and parade lectures on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of this month to arouse public awareness. The details of the conference are described below:</p>
<p>Exhibition: Prior to the conference, the association constructed a pine branch archway in front of the Qingnianhui Qian Hutung west entrance inside the Dananmen, decorated with five-colored electric lights and a white cloth with the nine characters "Shenyang City Health Campaign Conference" suspended in the middle, and prepared triangular small paper flags to be distributed to citizens by the city's labor unions and chambers of commerce to hang. Cloth plaques were hung and slogans printed by the Municipal Office at each city gate and traffic thoroughfare. Each report released a special health supplement. The east and west halls of the Youth Association were requisitioned by the Nanman Medical University and Chinese classmates to collect various specimens, instruments, models, and other items related to health and medicine and displayed separately from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM each day to allow people to enter and view them. Professors from the Liaoning Medical College and other schools were on hand to provide guidance at any time. It is estimated that nearly 20,000 to 30,000 men and women from the city visited during the three days.</p>
<p>Lectures: The association was scheduled to hold lectures in the Youth Association gym from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM every evening. After the lectures, health films, new dramas, magic shows, and other entertainment were screened. Admission tickets were available for anyone to obtain. The speakers on the first day were Gao Moquan and Liu Zhongming from the Liaoning Medical College. On the second day, they were Li Quancheng and Guo Guangwu from the Manchuria Medical University. On the third day, they were Wang Yougang and Dong Bingran from the Tongshan Medical College. Each lecture was designed to promote practical application of their theory, and so, after 5:00 PM each day, people came to listen.</p>
<p>Parade: The association was scheduled to hold a parade on the second day. Prior to the parade, a temporary mat shed was built directly north of the Xiaoheyan Public Sports Field, with a cloth sign reading "Shenyang City Health Campaign Conference" hanging at the entrance, as a gathering point for various agencies, organizations, and citizens to participate in the parade. On the morning of the 17th, Liu Guozeng, the head of the sanitation department of the Municipal Office, led his colleagues to the venue to take care of matters. Before long, personnel from various agencies and organizations below the provincial government, merchants, citizens, students from various schools, Boy Scouts, and public security teams.</p>

<p>Decorated publicity vehicles arrived one after another. Each agency and organization had a large flag, and each person held a small flag with health slogans written on it. At 10:00 AM, when all the participants had arrived, Chen Bolin and Zhang Songjun climbed onto a high table and used a megaphone to organize the ranks. After the ranks were organized, Xiong Fei, the commander-in-chief, gave the order, and the parade started amidst the music of the Bian Shu Orchestra. The mighty parade route started from Xiaoheyan, entered Dadongmen, passed through Siping Street Gulou, exited Daximen, and went all the way to the South Market. Along the way, the public security bureau's decorated publicity vehicles were decorated with models of rice buckets, dung buckets, flies, etc., and a paper-mache pig, vividly portraying the pig's mouth spitting out promotional materials at any time to attract the attention of the audience. The Changshi Promotion Association's decorated publicity vehicle was led by the association's president, Che Xiangchen, who led members in performing lung disease and various infectious diseases from unsanitary food and fly transmission to warn the citizens. It is estimated that more than 10,000 people participated, and the streets were packed with people. The parade did not disperse until 3:00 PM. Slogans: "Pay attention to personal hygiene," "Pay attention to public hygiene," "Hygiene promotes health," "Unsanitary conditions are suicide," "Hygiene and disease prevention," "Hygiene prolongs life," "Eliminate flies," "Defeat tuberculosis," "Eliminate dirt," "Clean homes."</p>

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Another Kidnapping Case at Xiema Bridge: Wu Yunzhou, a resident of Xiema Bridge and Shangbang in the county, was wealthy and coveted by kidnappers. He was previously targeted for kidnapping last year, but fortunately, Wu was not at home at the time, and the bandits kidnapped his uncle, Yin Zhai, who escaped safely afterward. Two bandit ships arrived at the location again the other day, with more than 20 bandits on board. After landing, they each held guns and swarmed into Wu's residence, kidnapping Wu Yunzhou and relatives Zhang Puren and a Chen-surname man and woman, and taking them to a boat on the Dianshan Lake. Afterwards, the Wu family did not report to the county government, nor did they receive any news from the bandits.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Silk Cocoon Association's Membership Fee Issue: The regular expenses of the local silk cocoon industry association were previously collected by the silk cocoon tax bureau at a rate of three cents per dan of dried cocoons, with two cents retained for the association's regular expenses and one cent transferred to the Shanghai Su Zhe Wan Silk Cocoon General Association to fund expenses. After the political opening in the 16th year of the Republic (1927), the one cent for the General Association was directly claimed from the Department of Finance, without being transferred through Wuxi. This year, the silk cocoon tax bureau was abolished, making it impossible to collect the tax. The Silk Cocoon Association raised the issue during a meeting the other day and initially planned to collect three cents per dan of fresh cocoons, following the Liyang method. After discussion, it was decided to collect a membership fee of five cents per dan of fresh cocoons, with three dan of fresh cocoons being equivalent to one dan of dried cocoons, totaling an actual collection of fifteen cents. The one cent for the Shanghai General Association will be discussed later. The business tax for cocoon stoves will continue to be collected at one yuan as before, and the newly established business tax will be petitioned for exemption.</p>
<p>Building a Boat Shed Leads to a Riot: The Minfeng Silk Factory in Yaozhuangbang, outside the South Gate of the city, planned to build a gasoline boat shed on the riverbank, which was obstructed by villagers such as Zhu Xiaodi. Zhou Jiashan, the head of the eighth sub-bureau of the public security bureau in charge of the area, fearing that incidents would occur, sent bureau member Cao and four policemen to suppress the situation. However, when they arrived at the factory, more than 300 villagers had already gathered. Cao tried to persuade the crowd, but the villagers had poor knowledge and a misunderstanding occurred, leading to a severe beating of Cao, causing serious injuries. Four rifles were also seized. Later, the third sub-bureau of the public security bureau and the police brigade headquarters were telegraphed to request police assistance. Wang, the head of the Wang sub-bureau, and Wang, the captain of the brigade, immediately dispatched armed police teams upon receiving the report. However, the villagers remained defiant. Seeing this, the police team fired several shots into the sky as a warning and carried out arrests, immediately detaining Zhu Xiaodi and Chen Fengquan, the two ringleaders. The seized firearms were also recovered and sent to the public security bureau. Yesterday, they were transferred to the county court for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Negotiating to Increase Business Tax Assessment: The county chamber of commerce previously convened a meeting of various industries to discuss and determine the method of paying the business tax. Each industry reported its business volume and the number of payments separately, which were verified and reviewed by industry leaders appointed by the chamber of commerce. It is estimated that more than 40,000 gold were identified. The other day, Yang Wubian, the director of the business tax bureau, was ordered by the Department of Finance to invite Qian Sunqing, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, to go to the Department of Finance to discuss the matter properly. Qian was unable to go due to other matters, and Yang returned to Wuxi yesterday. The Department of Finance believes that the assessed amount for each industry is too disparate and needs to be persuaded to increase it again. However, each industry believes that the silk industry is hopeless and the market is even more sluggish, making it impossible to increase the amount in fact. Director Yang has already informed the county chamber of commerce to notify various industries to gather at the chamber of commerce at 2:00 PM today (the 29th) for a discussion to negotiate a reasonable increase in the assessed amount to respect the wishes of the provincial government.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Local Court Investigates Li Leng's Bribery Case: Cai Dingcheng, a prosecutor of the Wu County Local Court, was ordered by the High Court to investigate the bribery and opium case of Li Leng, the former magistrate of Jiangyin, and has scheduled a hearing. Because the files of the cases of Mafeiqian Zhulang in Yueqiao Township, broken by the Public Security Bureau, and the cases of Qian Abao and others broken by Yang Bingwei, the opium investigation team leader, need to be reviewed, he sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau yesterday requesting them to send them for reference.</p>
<p>The Relief Institute Illegally Refuses News Interviews: Cao Yuanpu, the director of the Relief Institute, is collecting fish donation taxes for charity. He is now under instructions from the Provincial Government to implement the Ministry of Industry's instructions to actively promote the fishing industry, and all fish taxes and fish industry taxes are exempt. In the future, no agency shall establish other names to collect these donations. Because the Relief Institute did not comply with the order after receiving it, it had to wait until the current season's first quarter was collected before it could be published. On the 25th, the Jiangsheng Dasheng News reported that the fish industry had informed the fishmongers to stop collecting the taxes. Director Cao was angry with the two newspapers. Yesterday (the 26th), he ordered the staff to refuse interviews with the two newspaper reporters and stop their advertisements. The two newspaper editors believe that the Relief Institute is a local charitable organization and that this kind of illegal prejudice is suppressing public opinion. They are currently devising methods to deal with it in order to show justice.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Submitting a Petition to Severely Punish the Notorious Bandit Chen Wenqi: The Zhenjiang County Executive Committee held its 68th executive committee meeting yesterday to discuss the notorious bandit Chen Wenqi, who repeatedly burned, killed, and kidnapped in the four villages. He was previously captured by the county government and fled. He has now been escorted to the province in Hangzhou. Should we request that he be severely punished according to the law to eliminate bandits? It was decided to submit a petition to the province and forward it to the provincial government for legal action to serve as a warning.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Continue to Intrude on Fishing Grounds: In order to protect the coastal fishing industry in Jiangsu Province, the Provincial Government previously convened a fisheries protection conference. Regarding the prevention of foreign ships intruding on fishing grounds, two measures were discussed and decided, including the fact that the Agriculture and Mining Department should report the intrusion of Japanese fishing boats at any time based on the information obtained, and the Provincial Government ordered the Agriculture Department to comply. According to the department's investigation, since May 1 of this year, there are still 12 ships, including Man Qian Wan and Zhou Fang Wan, entering and leaving Shanghai and Hong Kong to sell their catches. In addition, there are more than 20 ships, including Da Cheng Wan, which previously intruded on fishing grounds. Fearing that the Chinese customs will prohibit imports on schedule, they are temporarily waiting to see. If this situation is not resolved in the shortest possible time, the influx of Japanese ships into Shanghai will be inevitable. It is reported that the department has submitted reports to the Provincial Government and the Ministry of Industry for verification.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>News of School Strikes: The schools in Jiangdu County have been on strike for more than three days due to funding issues. However, the content of this strike is not entirely consistent. Some have completely stopped, some have only stopped elementary classes and not high school classes, some are uniformly studying at school, and some are attending classes as usual. Therefore, some teachers and staff who advocate a thorough strike went to the schools that have not stopped classes today (the 27th) to persuade them to take unified action. However, it is heard that some teachers and staff believe that the sixth-grade students will be graduating soon, and it is impossible to stop classes completely. As for the salary issue, everyone unanimously agrees. However, the administrative side is planning in every possible way, and by the latest deadline of the abolished Dragon Boat Festival, they can only issue one and a half months' worth of salaries. There is no other way. The teachers and staff held another meeting today (the 27th) to discuss whether to resume classes immediately. There is no definite news yet.</p>
<p>Opium Suspect Resists Arrest and Assaults Police Officers: Gao Jichun, the head of the seventh sub-bureau of the public security bureau, received a report from Chen Bingyan, a resident of Chenjiadian, that Chen Yuanxing and Chen Yuanyi were selling large quantities of opium and that Wang Dajie was running an opium den. He sent inspector Liao Dingjie to lead the police with the original reporter to investigate. When they arrived at Chen Yuanxing's house, they found evidence of opium, lamps, and guns. The Chen family closed the door and rang the gong to gather a crowd to seize the evidence, tear the police uniforms, and beat the inspector and secret agent Wang Yaozhang on the head, causing them to bleed profusely. The reporter was also injured and had his pistol and watch stolen. Yesterday (the 26th), he reported the situation to the public security bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Four Bandits Captured in the Sixth District: Gao Jinkui, the leader of the 25th team of the 6th district of the water public security team stationed in Jieshouzhen, inspected a steamer in the town the other day and captured four bandits on the Qingzhen Changban small steamer. They were escorted to the city last night and sent to the 6th district for interrogation.</p>
<p>A Kidnapping Case Occurs in Nan'an Township: Five bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Chen Lianggui, the head of Nan'an Township in the fifth district of the county, at about 8:00 PM the other day. They each held guns and lured open the door to enter and loot extensively. Before leaving, they also kidnapped his daughter-in-law, Ms. Wang. He immediately reported to the Laorenqiao Police Team, which was stationed there. Squad leader Wang led a team to arrest the bandits, but they had already escaped without a trace. Township Head Chen has come to the city to petition the county government to strictly investigate.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Relocating the Wounded Soldiers' Factory Resolved by the Headquarters: All sectors of Tong County oppose the conversion of the poor people's factory into the Eleventh Fake Wounded Soldiers' Factory. The county government has telegraphed the provincial government to appeal for relocation to another location. On the 27th, County Magistrate Zhang received a reply from the provincial government stating that the telegram had been forwarded to the headquarters. It has been approved by Luo, the division commander of the 24th Division of the Army, in a telegram on the 25th, stating that Zhao Jianhua, the director of the relief institute, instigated the crowd to insult soldiers and seized weapons from the guards. The squad leader was also robbed when he went out to buy food. He requested strict punishment. If this is the case, it should be dealt with promptly and conveyed to all organizations to wait for instructions and not cause trouble. Because all sectors are extremely angry about the wounded soldiers' factory, County Magistrate Zhang specifically went to the province on the 28th to personally present everything to Chairman Ye.</p>
<p>Military Police Inspect Japanese Ships and Negotiate: The Nissin Shipping Company stated that in recent months, the Xiangyang, Fengyang, and Luoyang ships were ordered to stop for inspection when they passed through the Nantong Lujing Port by military police firing guns from small steamers, causing negotiations. On the 27th, the Department of Civil Affairs ordered the Nantong County Government to investigate the matter thoroughly and submit a fair report for verification.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Verdict in the Case of a Prostitute Dying from Abortion: Xiao Lin Suzhen, a prostitute at the Eryi Xiaozhu brothel in Houshi, Yong, had beautiful looks and was only 14 years old. General customers of pleasure all flocked to her. The prostitute secretly conspired with the customer and became pregnant. Fearing that her pregnant belly would affect her business, the prostitute’s room attendant, Zhu Fengbao, and the pimp, Zhu Fusheng, advocated calling the midwife, Xie Li, to use medicine to induce an abortion. Her biological mother, Lin Le, also did not stop her. Unexpectedly, the bleeding did not stop after the abortion, and she died three days later. The Yinxian Local Court Prosecutor’s Office heard about it and filed a report, ordering a group of witnesses to appear in court for investigation. Zhu Fengbao and Zhu Fusheng fled upon hearing the news, and Xie Li and Lin Le were sent to prison separately. The prosecutor then filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, the criminal court of the court ruled that the defendant, Xie Li, was guilty of deliberately profiting and causing an abortion that resulted in death and was sentenced to three years of imprisonment. The defendant, Lin Le, was guilty of requesting an abortion that resulted in death and was sentenced to three years of imprisonment. The trial proceedings for Zhu Fengbao and Zhu Fusheng were suspended.</p>

He pleaded and was eventually extorted 200 yuan. Since it was late at night and there was nowhere to raise the money, he first paid 78 yuan and limited the remaining amount to be paid at the Caijia Road Barracks Head at 5:00 PM the next afternoon. The third battalion of the Yuyao Security Team was informed of this and sent detectives Zhang Xinmei, together with Xie Alang, the squad leader of the Niqiaolu Defense Corps, and more than ten others, to go to the payment location with Sun Zhengfu. They saw eight bandits coming. The two sides exchanged fire. Farmers from nearby villages also heard the sound and came out to assist in the pursuit.

<p>Forfeits 200 Meters Due to Leg Injury</p>
<p>Jinan, 28th - Liu Changchun forfeits this afternoon's men's senior 200-meter final.</p>
<p>Jinan, 28th - Liu Changchun wins the men's senior 100 meters and 400 meters, but his 100-meter time is 11.8 seconds and his 400-meter time is 54.3/10 seconds, a significant decline from his previous performances. Meanwhile, the men's intermediate 100-meter time is 11.7 seconds. Although Liu Changchun has fallen to second place in sprinting due to a leg injury, the general public is still deeply regretful.</p>
<h3>Liu Changchun of Liaoning First in 100 Meters and 400 Meters</h3>
<h3>Weihai Becomes a Unit</h3>
<h3>Tianjin Unit Canceled</h3>
<p>Jinan, 28th - The North China Annual Meeting will be held at 7:00 PM tonight at the North China Preparatory Committee. The decision was made to cancel the Tianjin unit and establish Weihai as a unit. It is yet to be determined whether Xinjiang and Ningxia will join.</p>
<h3>Finals Overview</h3>
<p>Jinan, 28th - The situation of the important competitions is as follows:</p>
<p>800-Meter Final: Wang Minshen of Harbin, who had previously clocked 2 minutes and 3 seconds in the 800 meters, was the focus of the crowd's attention. As a result, Wang indeed broke the national record with a time of 2 minutes and 6.8 seconds to win first place. Zhang Xiang of Liaoning emerged as a dark horse and also broke the record with a time of 2 minutes and 7 seconds, trailing by 8 meters. Jiang Yunlong of Liaoning finished third, tying the national record with a time of 2 minutes and 8.4 seconds. Fan Baoen of Beiping finished fourth.</p>
<p>1500-Meter Final: It was initially believed that Jiang Yunlong of Liaoning, who held the national record, would maintain his championship. However, he nearly failed to qualify, falling behind by more than ten places at first. Fortunately, he worked hard and finished fourth. The first place went to the new general Zhang Baoxiang of Liaoning, who broke the national record with a time of 4 minutes and 21 seconds, beating the second place by ten meters. His posture was good, his elasticity was abundant, and with hard practice, he could still improve. Liu Guxue of Liaoning finished second with a time of 4 minutes and 22 seconds, also breaking the national record. Ma Degang competed fiercely with the second place. The four athletes were all from Liaoning.</p>
<p>Senior Discus: It was expected that Zhang Lingjia of Liaoning would break the national record. As a result, he unexpectedly finished second with a time of 35.49 meters. The first place went to Zhou Lianzeng of Liaoning, who achieved a score of 36.50 meters. Yang Xuexian of Shandong finished third with a score of 34.48 meters. Zhao Wenzao of Beiping also scored 33.42 meters for fourth place. Thirty-five people participated.</p>
<p>Women's 50 Meters: Xiao Shuling of Harbin clocked 7.3 seconds in the preliminaries, and Li Bojin of Tianjin clocked 7.3 seconds, both breaking the national record. Wang Yuan of Harbin was also selected for the finals. Both Xiao and Wang failed to win, while Wu Meixian won first place with a time of 7.4 seconds, tying the national record. Li Bojin finished second.</p>
<p>Women's Long Jump: Wu Meixian, the national champion, failed to qualify. The first, second, and third places all broke the national record. A total of 31 people participated. (1) Bian Junian (Tianjin), 4.46 meters; (2) Li Bojin (Tianjin), 4.24 meters; (3) Tong Zhiying (Shandong), 4.11 meters; (4) Yuan Chengxian (Qingdao), 4.07 meters.</p>
<p>Women's 80-Meter Hurdles: In the women's 80-meter hurdles final, the first place went to Zhang Suhui of Shandong, the second place went to Wu Zongwu of Beiping, the third place went to Sun Guiyun of Harbin, and the fourth place went to Sun Yuanshao of Liaoning. The time was 15.2/10 seconds. Sun Guiyun has a reputation as a national female runner, but this time she was defeated by Zhang Suhui of Shandong, which is regrettable. Zhang Suhui's first appearance was a great surprise, which is admirable.</p>

<h3>Chinese Supplementary Representatives</h3>
<h3>Li Shao Shang's Special Achievement</h3>
<p>The supplementary selection of Chinese representatives for the International Olympic Games was held at the Chinese Track and Field Field at 4:00 PM yesterday. The committee members arrived at the field to test the discus and pole vault events. Because the results of the testers were too poor (2.8 meters for pole vault and 2.8 meters for discus), no representatives were selected. Li Shao Shang's special achievement of 2 minutes 14 and 2/5 seconds in the 800 meters was selected as the official representative, adding Chen Xingpei to the list of original runners in the 10,000 meters.</p>
<p>(1) 800 meters: Li Shao Shang; (2) 1500 meters: Zhu Shaohua, Dong Jiaxie; (3) 10,000 meters: Chen Xingpei; (4) Shot Put: Wang Jihuai; (5) High Jump: Gu Yu, Chen Tianhe; (6) Long Jump: Chen Gongyu; (7) Triple Jump: Fan Jiaju, Li Lin; (8) 400-Meter Hurdles: Wu Zuxian</p>

<h3>Recovery of the French Concession Public Court</h3>
<p>Expected to be Implemented on July 1st</p>
<p>Little Progress in Sino-British-French Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Spoke in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting was scheduled to hold a garden party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office at Fenglin Bridge at 3:00 PM today. He arrived in Shanghai by overnight express train from Beijing at 7:00 AM yesterday with his wife. According to Wang's statement to reporters, he has repeatedly met with French Ambassador Wilden regarding the recovery of the French Concession's Joint Court. The Ambassador expressed his sympathy on principle, and negotiations are currently underway. It is expected that the recovery can be implemented around July via special telegram. As for the Sino-Russian Conference, it has recently focused on discussing the redemption of roads. Representative Mo has frequently reported that negotiations are progressing well. Wang also stated that there has been little progress in the Sino-British-French jurisdiction negotiations. Although the British side has proposed new methods, the Chinese side still cannot agree. As for the rumors that the Sino-American jurisdiction negotiations have suddenly run into trouble, with the American side demanding that China recognize the loans of the Beijing government, Foreign Minister Wang said that this was not true. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Wang visited Wang Chonghui at 5:00 PM yesterday for a meeting of about half an hour.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Streamlines Telecommunications</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Fuzhou Lines Being Repaired Quickly</p>
<p>Methods for Communication between Fujian and Taiwan Agreed Upon</p>
<p>More Copper Wires Added to Beijing-Shanghai Telephone Line</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has recently been actively streamlining telecommunications matters. According to a person from the Ministry of Communications who came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday, the Ministry's recent improvements to telecommunications can be divided into four categories: wired telecommunications, wireless telecommunications, underwater telecommunications, and telephone. The plans are described as follows:</p>
<p>Repair Trunk Lines: Regarding wired telecommunications, the Shanghai-Fuzhou telecommunication line has been ordered to be repaired in three sections. The remaining trunk lines between Fuzhou and Guangzhou and between Hankou and Chongqing will be constructed in the shortest possible time. New listening devices will be used, and operators from major bureaus across the country will be ordered to practice listening. A telegram skills competition is also being planned, starting with major bureaus and eventually expanding into a large-scale competition to improve the skills of telegram personnel.</p>
<p>Xiamen-Philippines Communication: Regarding wireless telecommunications, after the receiving and dispatching offices of the underwater wire companies in Fuzhou and Xiamen were taken back, all underwater wire telegrams were changed to be relayed via wired and wireless telecommunications. However, the Shanghai-Fuzhou wired telecommunication line is occasionally out of repair, and the machines at the Fuzhou and Xiamen stations are also small, fearing that they may not be able to cope. Personnel have been sent to install one 100-watt and one 75-watt short-wave machine in Fuzhou. The Xiamen and Taiwan sides have also newly installed 500-watt generators. The Shanghai radio station will greatly renovate its original machine. Furthermore, since communication between Xiamen and the Philippines has been relayed by Hong Kong and Shanghai, there has been a slight delay in time. Recently, an agreement has been made with the Philippines that direct communication is now possible.</p>
<p>Fujian-Taiwan Underwater Line: As for underwater lines, the telegrams between Fujian and Taiwan have been entrusted to the Great East Company by Japan. Now that the Great East contract has expired, the right to relay this information should be taken back by China. An order has been issued by the Ministry to stop the process and to request the representative of Japan to negotiate with the Telegraph Bureau to take over the relay. In order to take care of the communication between Fujian and Taiwan, temporary communication methods have been established.</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Telephone: As for long-distance telephone lines, the Beijing-Shanghai line is the most congested. The original long-distance telephone line between Beijing and Shanghai had three pairs of copper wires. Now, in order to facilitate calls and avoid congestion, materials such as sounding lines have been purchased, and it has been decided to add another pair. Commissioners have been assigned to start construction as soon as possible, and the project will be completed in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>National Government Will Issue Another Salt Tax Public Bond</h3>

<h3>Export of Local Goods Taxed at the Old Rate</h3>
<p>Limited to Those Delivered to Customs Before 4:00 PM Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs issued a notice stating that the export tax on local goods shipped abroad will be levied according to the new export tariff from June 1st of this year. The Customs has issued announcements on the 15th and 18th of this month. The regulations are now stipulated as follows: For ships heading to foreign ports that have been assigned a customs clearance number, if the export declaration for the local goods loaded on the ship is submitted to the Customs before 4:00 PM on the 30th of this month, the goods will still be subject to export tax and surtax at the current tariff rate. All merchants should be aware of this.</p>
<h3>Export of Local Silk Exempt from Special Tax</h3>
<p>Notice from Jianghai Customs</p>
<p>The General Affairs Department of Jianghai Customs issued a notice yesterday regarding the tax exemption for local silk. The notice stated that a special tax of 30 yuan in national currency per dan was levied on the shipment of yellow and white silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to foreign countries. The Customs had issued an announcement on the 18th of this month. Now, the Customs Service of the Ministry of Finance has ordered that this special tax will only be levied on factory silk shipped abroad, and all other types of non-factory silk will be exempted. Please be informed accordingly and notify all merchants.</p>

<h3>Soliciting Opinions on Export Tariffs</h3>

<p>Silk Industry</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Public Debt Committee</h3>
<p>To be established in Shanghai today</p>
<p>To be established in Nanjing on June 2nd</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance will dispatch Lu Shutang (Section Chief of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance) as a committee member responsible for allocating and safeguarding funds for the 8 million yuan Suzhou-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Debt. The Ministry of Industry will dispatch Mu Ouchu and Zou Bingwen as allocating committee members, and Song Ziliang and Liu Kuidu as safeguarding committee members. Along with these, representatives from silk factories in the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai areas, including Shen Huachen, Chu Huiseng, and Qian Fenghao as allocating committee members, and Wang Xiaolai, Wu Shenbo, and representatives from the financial sectors of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces as safeguarding fund committee members, will form a special committee for the silk industry public debt. The inaugural meeting was originally scheduled for today (the 29th) in Shanghai. However, it is understood that the Ministries of Finance and Industry, taking a cautious approach, have rescheduled the inaugural meeting for June 2nd at the Ministry of Industry in the capital. Executive committee members and chairpersons will be elected at that time. The allocation committee meeting will be held at 9:00 AM, and the safeguarding fund committee meeting will be held at 2:00 PM. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Shen Huachen, Chairman of the Special Relief Committee for the Silk Industry in the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai areas, received a telegram from the Ministries of Finance and Industry, informing him of this and sending the regulations and implementation details for the allocation of public debt and safeguarding fund committee. He immediately informed committee members such as Chu Huiseng and Qian Fenghao to review the documents. They are scheduled to travel to Beijing by the Shanghai-Nanjing overnight express on June 1st to attend and participate in the meetings.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Machine Industry Association to the Consolidated Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association recently sent a letter to the Consolidated Tax Bureau expressing its opinion that the customs declaration rules established by the Tax Bureau for goods exported overseas, which require the submission of a copy of the bill of lading or pier donation receipt when refunding taxes, are practically difficult to implement. The letter states: "We respectfully report that our members have informed the association that, according to Article 7, Section 4 of the customs declaration rules established by your bureau (details omitted) for the method of refunding the consolidated tax on cotton yarn for various cotton textile products manufactured by factories and exported overseas, 'In addition to filling out the tax refund application form and attaching the original tax payment certificate, it must be submitted to the resident customs office at the original place of shipment for inspection, endorsement, and stamping. The manufacturer shall then present it to the Consolidated Tax Bureau or district office for processing the tax refund according to regulations.' There is no mention of submitting a copy of the bill of lading from the shipping company. However, the application form for the tax refund on exported cotton yarn directly woven into finished products includes the words 'Attached is a copy of the bill of lading.' Moreover, the copy of the bill of lading for goods exported overseas and taxed according to regulations has a green wooden stamp that says, 'This bill of lading is only for the Consolidated Tax Bureau's retention and shall not be used as collateral by anyone, Chinese or foreign.' The receipt for the customs pier donation also has the stamp 'Approved for export tax refund by the Resident Customs Office of the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance at the Jianghai Customs.' Following the above procedures would cause difficulties. Submitting a copy of the bill of lading or pier donation receipt is practically impossible for the following reasons: (1) A copy of the bill of lading is traditionally kept as proof for retrieving goods in case the original is lost. (2) Merchants from distant regions often send the original bill of lading with the goods and mail the copy separately to prevent delays in sales if the original is lost. (3) If merchants from other provinces purchase goods such as towels and load them along with dozens of other types of miscellaneous goods into several boxes, the shipping company will issue only one set of original and duplicate bills of lading, which will also cause related difficulties. (4) Both the original and duplicate bills of lading for goods used for foreign exchange settlements must be submitted to the bank to comply with the settlement procedures. (5) The stamp on the copy of the bill of lading stating that 'This bill of lading shall not be used as collateral by anyone, Chinese or foreign' effectively deprives the merchant of their right to use it as collateral. (6) The receipt for the customs pier donation or dredging donation serves as proof for the company or business to reconcile accounts. The above difficulties sufficiently prove that the copy of the bill of lading or pier donation receipt should be kept by the merchant. According to our association's humble opinion, when cotton yarn or cotton yarn directly woven into finished products that have already paid the consolidated tax are exported overseas, the customs should only need to inspect the tax payment certificate and attached documents. The customs should then issue a certificate for the refund of the consolidated tax on the exported cotton yarn. The manufacturer can then use this certificate to claim the tax refund from the Consolidated Tax Bureau or district office. This is both convenient and free from corruption. We hope that our humble suggestion will be adopted. We respectfully submit this letter in the hope that it will be reviewed and approved."</p>
<h3>Reduction of Business Tax on Exported Tea Chests</h3>
<p>At a rate of five per thousand of the capital</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance replied yesterday to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's telegram, stating: "We have reviewed the Dongdai telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the request to exempt the business tax on exported tea chests. We believe that the business tax on tea manufacturing in that province should be reduced to five per thousand of the capital, and we have instructed the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance to comply accordingly. We have also received a telegram from the Shanghai Foreign Tea Firms Association presenting the previous situation to the Ministry, which has been noted and filed for reference. This is now being communicated to you for your information." - Seal of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3>Continued Intrusion of Japanese Vessels in Shanghai Waters</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining has submitted reports to the Provincial Government and the Ministry of Industry for review.</p>
<p>In order to protect coastal fisheries in Jiangsu Province, the Provincial Government previously convened a Fisheries Protection Conference. Regarding the prevention of intrusion by foreign vessels, two measures were resolved, including the provision that the Department of Agriculture and Mining would regularly submit reports on the situation of Japanese fishing vessels' intrusion, based on investigations. The Provincial Government instructed the Department of Agriculture to comply accordingly. According to the Department's investigation, since May 1st of this year, there have been twelve Japanese fishing vessels, including the Man Qian Maru and Zhou Fang Maru, entering and leaving Shanghai ports and dumping their catch. In addition, there are more than twenty vessels, including the Da Cheng Maru, which had previously been engaged in intrusion and are temporarily waiting and watching, fearing that Chinese customs will prohibit their import on schedule. If this situation is not resolved in the shortest possible time, the continuous arrival of Japanese vessels in Shanghai is expected. It is reported that the Department has submitted reports to the Provincial Government and the Ministry of Industry for review.</p>
<h3>The Qu Case to be Heard in Military Court</h3>
<p>Anhui Fellow Provincials Decide on Assistance Measures</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Evening News reports that U.S. military personnel involved in the stabbing injury case of Qu Shixiang, owner of a clothing store at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Gordon Road, and others, will be tried in a public military court, according to Colonel Hawke, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps, this morning (the 28th). Journalists and people from all countries will be allowed to attend the hearing. However, Colonel Hawke did not specify the date of the trial or the charges.</p>
<p>The case of the U.S. sailors stabbing Qu Shixiang, the owner of the Qu Shunji clothing store, his son, and his associate Ma Ruixiang on Avenue Edward VII and Gordon Road has aroused great indignation in all circles. The Anhui Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association held an executive meeting yesterday, chaired by Liu Zuwang, and resolved the following assistance measures: (1) Send a letter to the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office in Shanghai lodging a serious protest. (2) Send a letter to the Shanghai Bar Association requesting legal assistance according to the law. (3) Send a letter to the police requesting attention to the evidence of the assault. (4) Send a letter to Baolong Hospital requesting that the injured be given medical attention. At the same time, Zhu Runbin and Peng Tiancheng were dispatched to the hospital together with reporters Ding Zigu, Wang Haiqing, and Wang Zhaoyong to investigate the injuries of Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang. According to their investigation report, Qu Shixiang, a native of Tongcheng, 41 years old, was stabbed by an American soldier with a knife, which entered directly from the left temple to the ear, and his left arm was also injured. His injuries are extremely serious. He is still able to speak, but not much. Ma Ruixiang, a native of Hefei, was stabbed in the neck and the wound reached the oral cavity. He is unable to speak, and his injuries are also very critical. Dr. Li Zongwei of the hospital stated that although Qu is able to speak, the wound is in a vital area, and his life may be in danger. Ma's injury is not as vital, but the injury is also severe, and his life may also be difficult to save. The association investigated and requested to take photographs, but other doctors stated that the injured person's wound is still being stitched and dressed, and cannot be exposed to the wind, as it may endanger their lives. Permission was given to delay the photographs for a while. The circumstances of Qu and Ma's stabbing by the American soldiers are generally the same as reported in the newspapers. In addition to emergency assistance, the association will also report to the executive and supervisory committees for active negotiation and request the unified support of all sectors to protect the lives and safety of fellow provincials in the concession. It is also reported that Qu Haigou, whose name is not known, is currently at home.</p>

The original text is as follows: Gu Jingen, a carpenter from Taichang Construction Company, was shot and killed by U.S. sailors in his workshop bedroom on the evening of the 22nd of last month. Nine other carpenters were sleeping in the same room with Gu that day, and they were all spared from the disaster. The tragic news spread, and the world was filled with indignation. Sailors, whose duty it is to protect the peace, recklessly shot and killed innocent, unarmed civilians. It seems that they not only treat the lives of our people as if they were grass, but they are also public enemies of our nation (details omitted). Recalling the shadows of past tragedies, witnessing the frequency of today's disasters, and speculating on the hidden worries of the future, this association cannot help but be filled with trembling fear. We use the spirit of universal love and equality to shout out our national hatred: (1) Severely punish the murderers. The criminals should be submitted to our courts for severe punishment in accordance with the order of our government on January 1, 1930, and the recovery of judicial sovereignty. (2) Punish the officers. The U.S. sailors recklessly caused a major disaster of murder. The senior officers in charge are responsible for negligence, and at the very least, they should be dismissed and punished. (3) Compensation and condolence. The U.S. government is responsible for compensating the losses of the deceased with 100,000 yuan and consoling the family of the deceased with 20,000 yuan. (4) Formal apology. The U.S. government should formally apologize to the National Government for the occurrence of this tragedy and clearly state the measures to prevent and guarantee similar tragedies in the future. These four points are all passive and the minimum of follow-up measures, and they are what this association vows to strive for with all our might. Even more regrettable is that, following the Gu case, the U.S. sailors' barbarous and reckless provocations continue to occur one after another, such as two sailors fighting each other, angering a small worker and pushing him into the water to drown, and two sailors randomly stabbing Qu Shixiang and his store associate Mr. Ma with knives. If a fundamental prevention plan is not devised, the occurrence of tragic events will only increase. Tracing back to the root cause, it is the evil concessions and consular jurisdiction that are the root causes. These two are the most harmful poisons in the unequal treaties and the best tools for imperialist aggression against our country. Without recovering the concessions and abolishing consular jurisdiction, it is not enough to abolish the unequal treaties, and it is even less enough to eradicate the poison of imperialism. The National Assembly first took the abolition of unequal treaties as its banner and declared its determination to the world. This is a plan to learn from the past, prevent future occurrences, and achieve long-term stability. This association deeply hopes that the entire nation will be of one mind and support the resolutions of the National Assembly, urging the party branch to assist the government to implement them effectively. We also hope that our civilized allies will be enlightened by the happiness of freedom and equality and automatically wash away the sins of imperialism so that the bloody tragedy of mutual slaughter will never be seen again in Chinese territory. So that our Republic of China can establish equal friendship with all countries in the world, and shine brightly and illuminate the universe. All of us Chinese people must vow to strive with all our might to achieve the goals of this association, and we will not hesitate to make any sacrifice. This association respectfully represents all sectors of Shanghai in declaring our peaceful goodwill, and we hope that all compatriots in the country and friends from all over the world will take note. This declaration is hereby made by the Shanghai All-Circles Support Association for the Gu Jingen Tragedy on May 28, 1931.</p>

<h3>Wang Yansong Reported at the City Chamber of Commerce Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Process of the People's Assembly</p>
<p>Wang Yansong, the representative of the Shanghai business community attending the National Assembly, attended the welcome reception of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday to report on the process of attending the National Assembly. More than 160 representatives from various industries attended. The meeting began at 3:00 PM, presided over by Wang Xiaolai. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, Wang Yansong stood up and reported: "I am deeply afraid that my talent is limited and my responsibilities are heavy, and that I will not be able to bear the burden of being elected as a representative to the National Assembly by various industries. However, since the matter is a duty rather than a right, and since I have been entrusted by various industries, I must do my best. When I left, I was sent off by representatives from various industries at the station, which showed their deep love and made me feel even more responsible. I officially reported on the 4th, three days after arriving in Beijing, and the National Assembly opened on May 5th and closed on the 17th, lasting a total of 12 days. The proceedings of the meeting have been reported in the newspapers every day, so there is no need for me to repeat them.

<p>Three Districts Party Branch</p>
<h3>Convening a Talk with the Standing Committee Members of Each Branch</h3>
<p>Chen Boxiu, a standing committee member of the Executive Committee of the Third District Party Branch of the Kuomintang, located at Tianhou Palace on North Henan Road in this city, believes that the 32 district branches in the district have very few opportunities to meet and talk due to their work. The advancement of party affairs depends on the unity of mind, common faith, and mutual trust of comrades from all branches to effectively exert their strength. In order to connect party ties, exchange opinions, and promote party affairs in the entire district, it is specifically scheduled to convene a talk with the standing committee members of each branch in the district at the party branch at 7:00 PM today (the 29th) to solicit opinions on promoting party affairs in order to eliminate isolation in work and achieve the effect of unification and agility. Notices have been sent out yesterday. The names of the standing committee members of each branch in the district are recorded below: Branch 1 Wang Jianmin, Branch 2 Cao Hanfang, Branch 3 Li Runxiang, Branch 4 Wang Longzhang, Branch 5 Huo Yunsheng, Branch 6 Zhang Hanyun, Branch 7 Zhu Guilin, Branch 8 Zhou Zizhen, Branch 9 Shao Shunmin, Branch 10 Yuan Yeyu, Branch 11 Cao Yongyan, Branch 12 Pan Pangming, Branch 13 Chen Kechang, Branch 15 Zhou Shangen, Branch 16 Ye Xiufu, Branch 17 Sun Ruixian, Branch 18 Zhu Zhilin, Branch 19 Sun Ao, Branch 20 Zhang Xianfang, Branch 21 Zhu Renlong, Branch 22 Ye Jiaxing, Branch 23 Chen Hansheng, Branch 24 Feng Guangjia, Branch 25 Cai Xiaohe, Branch 26 Chen Cheng, Branch 27 Chen Zhen, Branch 28 Zheng Zibao, Branch 29 Jia Zhengzhi, Branch 30 Xu Manxin, Branch 31 Hu Zhongchi, Branch 32 Wang Bincun, Branch 33 Gu Jiwu</p>
<p>In the Huangpu River</p>
<h3>The Dahe and Jianghua Collided Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Both Ships Were Damaged</p>
<p>Negotiations are Underway for Repairs</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River ship Jianghua had just been repaired by the Jiangnan Shipyard and had just sailed out of the dock when it was hit by the Dada Company's Tongyang route ship Dahe. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Collision: At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the Jianghua ship left the Jiangnan Shipyard and was scheduled to dock at the Jinliyuan Wharf to load cargo and sail to Hankou this morning. At 9:42 AM, it was near the naval buoy near the Dada Company Wharf when the Dada Company's Yangzhou route ship Dahe entered the port. At this time, the current was swift, and the captain of the Jianghua ship, in order to ensure safety, first dropped anchor there to allow the Dahe ship to turn around. Unexpectedly, the Dahe ship stopped its engines on the left front side of the Jianghua ship and quickly reversed, and its stern crashed violently into the bow of the Jianghua ship. The Jianghua ship had already dropped anchor and could not avoid the collision.</p>
<p>Damage: The stern of the Dahe ship swung into the bow of the Jianghua ship with great force, causing significant damage to the Jianghua ship. The wooden iron railing on the second deck was broken for 25 feet, two angle iron support pillars were broken, two drainage pipes were also broken, the lower wooden railing was broken for 15 feet, two support pillars were destroyed, and the bulwark was broken for three feet. The Dahe ship's rear stern was also seriously damaged due to the huge backwash force. The teak flat plate was destroyed, the triangular iron was cracked, and two support pillars were also broken. The collision occurred at 9:45 AM.</p>
<p>Entering the Shipyard for Repairs: After the accident, the Dada Company, because the Dahe ship had a scheduled voyage, first towed the Dahe into the shipyard for repairs. The company sent personnel to the Jianghua ship to inspect the damage and then sent a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stating that the Dahe was entering the port and the Jianghua was turning around, and the two ships collided because they could not avoid each other, resulting in the Dahe ship being hit by the Jianghua, and the Jianghua also suffered minor damage. The wording of the letter seemed to indicate that the responsibility for the collision lay with the Jianghua, not the Dahe.</p>
<p>Responsibility: After the incident, the captain of the Jianghua ship reported to the head office, stating that at 9:42 AM on this day (the 28th), the ship sailed from the Jiangnan Shipyard to the naval buoy near the Dada Wharf, and the Dahe ship entered the port with the tide. The ship first stopped to allow the Dahe ship to have enough space to turn around. Unexpectedly, the ship stopped and quickly reversed on the left front side of the ship, causing the ship to be hit (details omitted). The head office then replied to the Dada Company based on the captain's report, stating that according to the captain's report, the responsibility for the collision lies with the Dahe, and the damage to the Jianghua ship should be the responsibility of your company for repairs. This letter was sent out yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Rushing to Repair for Export: After the engineer sent by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company inspected the damage to the Jianghua, the company hired workers to urgently repair the ship to avoid delaying the voyage because the ship had to export that night. The company will also re-list the detailed repair costs in order to claim compensation from Dada. The Dahe ship is also being repaired urgently so that it will not miss its voyage.</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs</p>
<h3>Commercial Goods Not Allowed to be Transported to Huludao</h3>
<p>A Batch of Materials Transported to the Port</p>
<p>The Huludao port construction project is underway. One ship from the German Hengbao Company, a shipping company in Shanghai, had already been dispatched to Huludao last month, transporting over 300 tons of goods. Now, the second ship, the Shalan, arrived from Hengbao China, carrying a batch of materials for the construction of the Huludao port, which must be transshipped to the port for delivery. When the Hengbao Company dispatched the Shalan to Huludao, it added a batch of commercial goods to the ship, as the cargo space was still available. However, during customs declaration, the Jianghai Customs suddenly prohibited the transportation of passengers and goods to the island and refused to accept the declaration of goods for customs, tax collection, and loading. Only the building materials for the Huludao port construction project were allowed to be transported by the Shalan, and all other goods were refused. The company had to completely handle the withdrawal of the declaration for the goods it had contracted to transport to Huludao and transport the building materials such as hardware and rubber products to the port.</p>
<h3>Additional Information After the Resolution of the Slaughter Tax</h3>
<p>Corrections from the Health Bureau: In a news item in the newspapers the day before yesterday regarding the reopening of meat shops, there was a request to abolish the technician inspection fee. Inspection of slaughtered livestock is carried out to prevent epidemics and ensure the safety of meat for the sake of maintaining public health. The bureau has planned and designated multiple locations in the city for centralized slaughter in order to facilitate inspection and save expenses. The office expenses for all designated locations were originally planned to be paid by the city treasury. Later, meat shops in the Jiangwan district submitted a request to be exempted from merging with other districts for slaughter and inspection, and they were willing to share the inspection office expenses and requested that a veterinarian be assigned to inspect them on-site. The municipal government approved the request. Subsequently, meat merchants in Zhenru, Pusong, Fahua, Yangjing, Tangqiao, Gaoqiao, Yinhang, and other districts followed the precedent set by the Jiangwan district and requested to be allowed to pay the inspection office expenses and send personnel to inspect them nearby. After the bureau reported the situation to the municipal government for approval, they were allowed to pay. The funds were entirely used to offset the expenses of the inspection office. Therefore, the expenses were incurred by the meat merchants in each district requesting to set up a slaughter inspection office on-site for their own convenience, and they were approved after being reported to the municipal government. The official name and definition is actually the office expenses for the slaughter inspection office recognized by the meat shops in each district for their own convenience and cannot be called a technician inspection fee. The name and facts reported in the newspaper are very different from the established case and should be corrected in order to clarify the truth to the public. Until a method of offsetting the necessary expenses of this office is determined, it will still be difficult to abolish the expenses in order to maintain the operation of the business and should be subject to approval and implementation by the municipal government.</p>
<p>Procedures for Purchasing Tax Tickets: Yesterday, someone inquired about the procedures for purchasing slaughter tax tickets from the Municipal Finance Bureau. According to the Finance Bureau staff's response, the nature of the slaughter tax tickets is the same as that of stamp tax tickets, and meat merchants can purchase them from various tax collection offices at any time. Whether it is a whole book or individual sheets, there will be no mistakes as long as it is verified that they were issued by the bureau.</p>
<h3>Pre-Slaughter Inspection Fee for Pigs</h3>
<p>To be Collected Directly by the Finance Bureau Starting June 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health and Finance Bureaus jointly issued a public notice yesterday stating: "It has been found that pigs transported to the concessions in the city area have been subject to pre-slaughter inspection by this Health Bureau, and an inspection fee of one dollar per pig has been collected. Zhang Baokun, the representative of the meat merchants, was previously approved to bear and pay this fee. It has now been found that the merchant's contracted period expires at the end of May of this year, and this bureau has reported it to the municipal government for approval. Starting June 1st, the collection will be directly collected by this Finance Bureau, and merchants will no longer be invited to contract. The pre-slaughter inspection fee of one dollar per pig will still be collected for each pig transported to the concession. No inspection certificate will be issued without purchasing a fee receipt."</p>
<h3>Request to Revoke the Merchant Recognition for the County's Slaughter Tax</h3>
<p>The County Government's Approval Order Was Not Granted</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Minhang Chamber of Commerce recently received a letter from the Pickled and Fresh Goods Trade Association stating that the county's slaughter tax had been contracted out to the Tongye Xiangxuetang for an annual tax amount of 2,860 yuan for Jiangsu education funds. Now, the base amount for merchant bidding is 4,000 yuan, and Wang Shoumei actually won the bid with 4,516 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 fen. Adding the surcharge of 812 yuan, 9 jiao, 9 fen, and 9 li, the amount is almost double the original. Moreover, Wang is an outsider to the industry. Given the current poor harvest and sluggish business in various villages, Wang's high bid price will inevitably lead to harsh and excessive levies in the future.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>This will hinder the development of the industry. However, considering that the slaughter tax is related to dedicated education funds, the association is willing to undertake the tax payment according to the bid amount to avoid disturbances. Therefore, they request the government to revoke Wang Shoumei's contracted concession and allow the association to pay the tax, etc. The Chamber of Commerce immediately submitted the situation to the County Government for review. Yesterday, a decree was issued by Magistrate Yan, stating roughly that the Pickled and Fresh Goods Trade Association is deeply aware that the slaughter tax is related to dedicated education funds and is willing to undertake the payment according to the bid amount, which shows a clear understanding of righteousness and is worthy of praise. However, Wang Shoumei's bid was made in accordance with the announcement and regulations of the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, and the office has approved the procedures. Since there is nothing improper, it is difficult to approve the request to revoke the concession. As for the collection of taxes, there are established regulations that cannot be exceeded, so there is no need to worry about disturbances.</p>

<h3>Mediating the Wharfage Dues Issue</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Brokers and Merchant Guilds Attended</p>
<p>Negotiations Among the Three Parties Within a Week</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the Chamber of Commerce convened a mediation session regarding the issue of wharfage dues responsibility between the cotton cloth brokerage and forwarding industries. Representatives present included Zhu Xiechen from the Forwarding Brokers Trade Association, Wu Yongxia from the Shanghai Merchant Guild Association, Wang Boxin and Yu Zizhang from the Shandong Guild Hall, Yang Junxin from the Sichuan Merchant Association, Chen Songyuan, Ke Ganchen, and Shi Jiumao from the Cotton Cloth Association. Luo Qinghua, Director of the Business Department of the City Chamber of Commerce, chaired the meeting, with Xue Guangqian as the secretary and recorder.</p>
<p>Discussion Summary The chairman reported the reasons for convening the meeting as ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau. First, the cotton cloth industry representative stated that there are two situations regarding cotton cloth: (1) For exports handled by merchant guilds, permits include wharfage dues, etc.; (2) For inland sales, there are no such taxes. Our industry is like a brokerage, and if we sell goods to merchant guilds, they issue permits, and the forwarding brokers handle the customs declaration. Now that the government is implementing unified taxation and the permit system has been abolished, our industry has no responsibility to pay taxes on behalf of customers. Next, the representative of the Shanghai Merchant Guild Association stated that merchant guilds are unfamiliar with the local area and entrust all matters to the forwarding agencies. Merchant guilds do not deny tax obligations. Chairman Luo Qinghua then spoke, saying that since merchant guilds have acknowledged tax obligations, there is legally no issue. The current discussion should focus on whether the cotton cloth or forwarding brokerage industry should be responsible, as the merchant guilds are unfamiliar with the local area and must entrust a third party to handle the payments. The cotton cloth industry representative reiterated the reasons why they cannot pay on behalf of customers and the convenience of having the forwarding industry do so. Representatives from the Merchant Guild Association and the forwarding industry then stated the difficulties in having the forwarding industry pay on behalf of others.</p>
<p>Mediation Result The chairman stated that the two sides' discussions were not close enough, and it was difficult to reach a satisfactory solution on the spot. He concluded the case, saying that the responsibility for paying wharfage dues belongs to the merchants, which is undisputed. However, the merchants are unfamiliar with the local area and must entrust a third party to handle it. Since both the cotton cloth and forwarding brokerage industries have various difficulties and are unwilling to handle it on behalf of others, it cannot be forced. There are now two proposed solutions: (1) Each representative will go back and consider the matter. Within a week, the three parties will negotiate to see if a result can be reached before reporting back to the Chamber for handling; (2) The situation of this mediation will be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau. As the representatives believed that the only point of contention was the cotton cloth and forwarding brokerage industries' obligation to pay on behalf of customers, and there was still room for joint consultation, they unanimously agreed to adopt the first solution. The chairman then announced the temporary end of the day's mediation.</p>

<p>Unanimously Advocate Investigating Those Who Framed Them</p>

<h3>Jiang Lugen Accused of Seduction and Fraud</h3>
<p>A Woman from Changzhou, Zhu, Recently Entrusted Lawyer Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng to File a Lawsuit with the Special District Court Accusing Jiang Lugen of Crimes Such as Seduction and Fraud. Her Complaint Stated That the Plaintiff Was Formerly Married to Zhang Apei. Shortly After His Death, He Left Behind More Than 4,000 Yuan in Cash, Along With Clothing and Other Items Worth Nearly 10,000 Yuan. As the Second Anniversary of Her Husband's Death Approached, the Defendant Jiang Lugen Coveted Her Property and Repeatedly Tried to Seduce Her. She Initially Ignored Him, but He Persistently Harassed Her and Claimed That His Wife Had Already Run Away and That He Was Willing to Marry Her; Otherwise, He Would Ruin Her Reputation, and Her Life Would Be in Danger. Under Duress, She Immediately Cohabited with Him at 597 Kang Nao Tuo Road. It Was Said That the Defendant Was Accustomed to Vulgarity and Associated with Gangsters, Not Engaging in a Livelihood. He Relied on the Cash Left by the Plaintiff's Late Husband for Living Expenses, Extorting Money and Pawning Clothing for His Squandering. In May 1929, the Defendant Was Involved in a Kidnapping Case with Chen Jinfa and Was Detained for Five Months. After Hiring a Lawyer for Defense and Many Efforts, He Was Finally Released by the Court After It Was Determined That He Was Not Involved. Unexpectedly, After His Release, He Not Only Did Not Know to Be Grateful but, Seeing That the Plaintiff's Savings Had Been Exhausted, Intended to Abandon Her. He Became Violent and Beat Her. She Was Forced to Return to Her Mother's Home to Demand Repayment of the Advance Payments. Although He Agreed to Pay 40 Yuan Per Month for Living Expenses, He Requested a Postponement of the Repayment of the Debt. On May 16 of This Year, Because He Did Not Pay the Advance Payments and Owed Debt, She Demanded Them Strictly, Which Led Him to Hold a Grudge in His Heart. The Next Day, He Assembled Many People to Ambush Near Her Residence. When the Plaintiff Passed By, They Rushed Out and Injured Her Head with Weapons, Creating Two Holes About an Inch Deep. Her Waist, Arms, and Other Parts of Her Body Were Also Severely Injured. She Immediately Reported This to the Nearby Songshan Road Police Station, Which Sent Her to Renji Hospital for Treatment.

<h3>A Sudden Love Letter</h3>
<p>Almost Cost Wang Axi Her Life</p>
<p>Lu Azhong, also known as Lu Xiutao, 28 years old, from Ningbo, lives at 242 Renyu Lane, Baochang Road, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. He is an employee on the Japanese ship Nanyang Maru. His wife, Wang Axi, 22 years old, also from Ningbo, is a worker in a cigarette factory. They have a daughter named Lianying, who is only 5 years old. Recently, Lu suspected that his wife Wang was having an affair with someone else, which caused discord between the couple, and they often argued and fought. Unexpectedly, the other day, a letter signed by Sheng Laiming arrived. The envelope was addressed to Wang Axi and was marked as sent from Tianjin, but the postmark on the stamp clearly showed Shanghai. Azhong received the letter and opened it. The content was roughly as follows: "After our love affair began, I originally intended to remain consistent to the end. However, your husband has learned of it and has abused you in every way. I really can't bear it. I will cut off all ties of love from now on so that your couple can remain as good as before," and so on. After reading it, Azhong believed that this was solid evidence and beat his wife severely without asking for the reason, saying, "If you don't truthfully confess your lover, I will definitely take your life with an ax tonight." Overwhelmed with anger, Wang was so upset that she wished she were dead. In the evening, when Azhong went out, Wang took the opportunity to leave, heading south on North Henan Road. Unexpectedly, her husband chased after her, cursing as he ran. When they reached Tianhou Palace Bridge, Lu shouted, "Your death place has arrived! Die quickly! Die quickly!" Wang became even more angry and jumped into the river from the wharf of the nearby post office to seek death. Others saw what happened and wanted to save her, but Lu firmly blocked them. Fortunately, Hua, a patrolman named Xunjiang from the Customs Water Police Station, passed by and immediately rescued her. Because it was not too late, her life was not in danger. She was taken to the police station, where she confessed the details. The police station ordered detective Huang Songsheng to investigate and brought her husband to the police station to be detained on the charge of forcing his wife to commit suicide, pending transfer to the court for trial. Yesterday morning, her sister came to the station to request permission to mediate. She repeatedly explained the advantages and disadvantages to Lu. Hearing this, Lu suddenly realized his past mistakes and cried with his wife, asking for reconciliation on the spot. The police chief approved the dismissal of the prosecution and ordered the original detective to transfer the couple to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau for disposition.</p>

<h3>Longzhang Paper Mill Expands Machinery</h3>
<p>The Longzhang Paper Mill in Rihui Bridge in this city is a pioneer in China's paper industry. The old machines are insufficient for its needs, and it has repeatedly added machines to expand. Last year, it ordered a complete set of a 1,000-kilowatt turbine generator and a 1,000-horsepower motor from Weimo Electric Factory in the United Kingdom. They were successively shipped to China and entrusted to the Shanghai Xinzhong Engineering Company for installation. The project was completed many days ago, and a formal test run was held yesterday. Representatives from Longzhang Maowei and Xinzhong attended the event. The result was very satisfactory. The new-style cultivator machine from the United Kingdom is installed on the condensing cabinet, which can save the cost of the base construction, but the installation is extremely difficult. The Xinzhong Engineering Company undertook the entire project quickly and stably, which was well-received by both parties. The 1,000-horsepower motor is also rare in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Old Beggar Is a Thief</h3>
<p>Pretending to Be Sick Lying at the Back Door</p>
<p>Zhao Fushou Is a Habitual Thief</p>
<p>Chen Zhongbao, 19 years old, and Feng Gu, 20 years old, from Ningbo, are currently studying at the Southeast Medical College of the Shanghai Army Camp in Nanshi and reside together at No. 121 Nanjing Street near the school. At about 6:00 AM on the 26th of this month, Chen and Feng got up one after the other and went to school together. As soon as they left the door, they suddenly saw an old beggar sleeping at the back door, but they did not pay much attention to him. When they returned from school, Wang Yucai, their fellow villager who lived with them, suddenly said, "When you went to school, you didn't close the back door after leaving, which caused a thief to break into my home and steal more than a dozen items, including my clothes, thermos, and sundries. But you should be responsible for this matter." Chen and others realized that the old beggar they saw at the back door in the morning must have been the thief. By this time, there was no trace of him, and they had to admit their bad luck and agreed to compensate for the loss. Until about 4:00 AM yesterday, Zhang Shishi, 41 years old, from Tongzhou, who lived in the house next door at No. 123, was selling fruit. At that time, Zhang sent his daughter out because of something, and when he stepped out of the door, he suddenly saw an old beggar lying on the back door steps, moaning incessantly, looking as if he was ill. At that time, he was not surprised, so he turned around and left. Not long after Zhang returned home and entered the bedroom, he saw the sick beggar who had been lying on the steps suddenly carrying two brass teapots belonging to his family, poking his head and looking around. He realized that he was a thief and immediately jumped up, grabbed him tightly, and shouted "Thief!" Chen Zhongbao, Feng Gu, Wang Yucai, and others also heard the sound and rushed to Zhang's house next door. They saw that the thief Zhang had caught was the old beggar they had seen sleeping at the back door last time. At this time, they were extremely angry and immediately went out and reported to Wu Shutang, the guard on duty at the 22nd post, who brought the thief to the First Branch of the First District Police Station. During the preliminary interrogation by the director of the station, the thief confessed that his name was Zhao Fushou, 57 years old, from Shaoxing, and that he was staying at the Fuxinggong Inn in Laobeimen, Minguo Road. He used to make a living by selling tofu and dried bean curd. Because the profit from that business was too small, he had no choice but to resort to this tactic, pretending to be a sick beggar and sleeping on the steps of the back doors of the surrounding residents, taking the opportunity to break in and steal things when people were unprepared. He was ordered to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Petition to Dredge the Putan</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang and Other Representatives of the Shipping Households in the Shanghai South District Believe That the Putan Along the Folk Boat Wharves in Nanshi Is Becoming Increasingly Silty, Obstructing Transportation and Harming Commerce. Yesterday, They Jointly Submitted a Petition to the Municipal Government Requesting Dredging to Facilitate Transportation. The Petition Stated That the Dredging of Shallow Beaches Along the River Is Requested to Facilitate Transportation. Since the Wharves Along the Coast of Nanshi Were Taken Over by the City, Except for the Steamboat Wharves, Which Have the Public Works Bureau Establish a Management Office, the Boat Docks from Wanyu Wharf to Santai Wharf Have Not Been Dredged for Several Years, Resulting in the Increasing Silting of the Putan. It Is Difficult for Cargo Ships Arriving from Various Roads in the Urban Area to Dock and Unload. In Addition, Bamboo and Wood Businesses Along the Coast Use the Putan as a Place to Store Materials, Stacking Them Higher and Higher Without Limits. There Are Also Many Junks Occupying the Shallow Beaches Along the Coast, Using Them as Homes, Which Makes It Easier for Water, Sand, and Mud Brought by the Tide to Accumulate. The Shallow Beaches on the Side of the Putan Are Widening, and the Shipping Lanes in the Putan Are Narrowing Day by Day, Which Obstructs the Sailing of Folk Boats and Steamships. Previously, It Was Reported That the Wharf Management Office of the City Public Works Bureau, in View of the Deep Accumulation of Mud on the Putan Surface of Various Steamboat Wharves, Which Hinders the Navigation of Ships and Affects the Losses of Merchants, Had Informed the Municipal Government to Find Ways to Dredge It, and It Is Reported That Approval Has Been Granted. Recently, They Are Actively Consulting with the Dredging Bureau and Will Soon Be Able to Implement Dredging. Since the Steamboat Wharves Already Have the Public Works Bureau Responsible for Dredging, the Part of the Folk Boat Wharves Should Also Be Regarded as the Same. It Is Found That the Cargo Ship Registration Statistics Last Month Reached More Than 8,600, and the Monthly Boat Donation Revenue Is About 18,000 Silver Dollars, Which Is More Than Sufficient to Maintain the Wharf. However, the Shallow Beaches South of Wanyu Wharf Have Never Been Dredged or Built as a Wharf, Which Makes It Difficult for Cargo Ships Arriving in Shanghai to Dock and Makes It Difficult to Load and Unload Cargo Far in the Center of the River. It Is Thought That Wanyu, Gongyi, Dongjiadu, and the South Hall Wharves Are the Most Prosperous Areas for Ships from the Four Townships and Are the Commercial Center of the Coast of Nanshi. Now That the Public Works Bureau Has Been Approved by Your Government to Contact the Dredging Bureau to Dredge the Steamship Wharves, the Adjacent Folk Boat Wharves Are Also Under the Rule of Your Government and Fulfill the Obligation of Paying Taxes. They Should Be Planned and Dredged Together. Therefore, They Jointly Submit This Petition to Your Seat, Requesting That You Approve and Order the Public Works Bureau to Plan and Carry Out the Dredging of the Folk Boat Wharves and the Steamship Wharves at the Same Time to Benefit Shipping and Avoid Partiality. They Will Be Grateful Beyond Measure.</p>

<h3>Inciting Prostitution Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Two defendants filed a counterclaim</p>
<p>Lawyer requested to examine Han Village</p>
<p>Li Xuru, a woman from Beiping, graduated from a normal university in Japan in her early years. After graduation, she founded the Modern Times in Tianjin and established a school in Beiping. Her husband, Kong Ren, is currently employed in Guangdong. Recently, Li, along with Chen Yindi, a 13-year-old girl from Yangzhou, retained lawyer Ye Fukan to file a criminal lawsuit with the Special District Local Court against Yao Zhang (43 years old), the wife of the deceased famous actor Yao Junqing from Beiping, who lives at No. 18 Jiufu Lane, Mengdelan Road, and is a shareholder of the former Grand Theater, and her daughter Yao Shunxi (also known as Yuqin, 21 years old) for obstructing public morals and other offenses. The following is a record of the situation:</p>
<p>The plaintiff's complaint is for abducting and escaping, and for seducing and raping a virgin. They requested that the case be arrested and severely punished, and that the person be handed over. The first plaintiff, Li Xuru, married Ren Shuzhen (now named Yanhua) in Beiping at a high price. In October of the 19th year of the Republic, she took her to Shanghai and lived upstairs with the defendants. Who knew that the defendant's mother and daughter were famous salted meat dealers in Northern Shanghai, and they often took Shuzhen out to play. At first, they did not feel strange. Later, the plaintiff left Shanghai in mid-November of the same year, leaving only Shuzhen, the second concubine, Ms. Gao, and Ms. Gao's mother, Ms. Tian, in Shanghai. When the plaintiff returned to Shanghai in March of the second year of the Republic, it was only a few days. Unexpectedly, the defendants had seduced Shuzhen, abducted her without a trace, and seized more than a thousand yuan of clothing and accessories. After investigation, Chen, the daughter of a tenant downstairs, Yindi (the second plaintiff), said that after the plaintiff left Shanghai, the defendant's mother and daughter often took Shuzhen and Yindi out. Every time they went, they would first go to the concubine's house of the front desk manager of the Shanghai Theater to change into grand clothes and go to the No. 1 Lian Sheng Fang salted meat store on Changbang Road to introduce customers and arrange prostitution. This abduction must be the instigator, and Yao Zhang and her daughter also tricked Chen Yindi into going to the salted meat store to receive customers at the same time. Because she refused, she was not harmed, etc. When asked about Ms. Lao Si, a neighbor, she also said that the defendants often lured Shuzhen to the salted meat store to introduce prostitution. Now that Shuzhen has fled, the defendant is definitely the instigator. The facts are obvious. The defendants' previous actions violated Article 246 of the Criminal Law. It seems that this kind of luring good women to salted meat stores for adultery is a common business, and the victims are too numerous to count. How much harm does it cause to public morals? Therefore, I ask your court to quickly arrest the defendants and punish them severely according to the law, and order them to hand over the victim, Shuzhen, and the clothes and accessories worth more than a thousand yuan attached to the civil lawsuit, and order them to be recovered to uphold the law and punish the wicked.</p>
<p>Defendant's defense: The court approved the application and issued a summons a few days ago to arrest and inform them. When the time came to surrender to await interrogation, Yao Zhang and Yao Shunxi also retained lawyers Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng. In addition to defending according to the law, they also claimed that Li Xuru and others' accusations were completely false. They also filed a counterclaim accusing Li Xuru and Chen Yindi of slander and damage to their reputation. Their counterclaim is recorded below as a notification to defend according to the law and file a counterclaim, requesting that they be severely punished to deter slander and protect their reputation. The first defendant and counterclaimant, Yao Zhang, is the wife of the deceased famous actor Yao Junqing, the former shareholder of the Grand Theater. She has lived in Shanghai with her husband and daughter Shunxi for many years. She inherited her late husband's property and can barely make ends meet. She has never engaged in illegal activities. The two counterclaim defendants rented the defendant's remaining house in succession in 18 years of the Republic. Because of the pursuit of rent arrears and other facts, they each had grievances in their hearts and dared to collude and fabricate facts to falsely accuse them, causing the counterclaimant's reputation to suffer significant damage. The reasons are described below: "Defense Part" According to the plaintiff, the defendant and counterclaimant is a famous dealer of salted meat shops in Northern Shanghai, usually taking Shuzhen out to play, and taking advantage of Li Xuru's departure from Shanghai to seduce Shuzhen and abduct her without a trace, and seize more than a thousand yuan of clothing and accessories. After investigation, Chen Yindi claimed that she and Shuzhen were often taken out by the defendant and went to the concubine's place of the front desk manager of the Shanghai Theater to change into grand clothes and go to the salted meat shop to introduce prostitution. Therefore, Shuzhen's flight this time was actually instigated by the defendant, etc. Li Xuru and her husband Kong Ren rented the defendant's wing house in October of the 18th year of the Republic with a wife and two concubines (one of whom is Shuzhen, also known as Yanhua). Chen Yindi rented the defendant's remaining house in April of the 19th year of the Republic. The relationship between the landlord and the guest is only a formality. Ren Shuzhen ran away privately in March of the 19th year. At that time, Chen Yindi had not yet met her. How could they have gone out together? Li Xuru already knew that the defendant was a famous dealer of salted meat shops. How could she allow her to often take Shuzhen out to play? Chen Yindi, again, how could she not love herself and be willing to go out with the defendant? The so-called neighbor woman named Lao Si does not exist. What is the reference to? This kind of fabricated fact has already been falsely accused. I will briefly defend and request your review. "Counterclaim Part" The reason is that Li Xuru's husband, Kong Ren, rented the counterclaimant's building in October of the 18th year of the Republic with a wife and two concubines. Seeing that the counterclaimant was a lonely widow who could be bullied, he teased the second counterclaimant, Shunxi, and hoped to make her his concubine. By March of the 19th year, Ren Shuzhen was abused and fled privately, and his lust became more intense. He dared to show frivolous behavior from time to time. Because of his humble character, he also disregarded his face and reprimanded her directly. By May, he felt ashamed and moved to another place. The original complaint falsely claimed that Ren Shuzhen was abducted and hidden without a trace in March of this year. I did not know that Shuzhen had fled in March of the 19th year and had already entrusted lawyer Zhang Yuanmei to publish a statement in July of the same year to sever the relationship between husband and concubine. The first defendant first entrusted lawyer Ye Fukan on May 13 to send a letter threatening to explain the address where Shuzhen was abducted within two days. He immediately entrusted lawyer Fan Gang to reply, ordering him to inquire with lawyer Zhang. The first defendant still falsely entrusted and filed a false accusation. As for Chen Yindi, she is the daughter of a tailor and her behavior is frivolous. She is not willing to associate with him. Because she owed rent and was pursued for loans, she harbored resentment. In March of this year, she worshiped Li as her adoptive mother. The original statement is obviously false. She is in the position of a plaintiff, but the counterclaimants are engaged in prostitution. She has been victimized. However, she is willing to sacrifice her reputation and collude with Li to damage the counterclaimants' reputation. The first counterclaimant is old and reputation is a person's second life. She cannot allow it to be sullied. The second counterclaimant is even more embarrassed as she is waiting to be married. Therefore, she filed a counterclaim (omitted below), requesting that the counterclaim defendant be punished for the crimes he deserves in accordance with Articles 180 and 324 of the Criminal Law, and ordered to publish the defense statement in the newspaper in accordance with Articles 185 and 332 of the same law to compensate for the loss of the counterclaimants' reputation.</p>
<p>The situation of the trial: Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, Judge Luo Renji of the Special Court came to the second court to interrogate both parties. Both parties were accompanied by their lawyers. First, Judge Luo asked both parties about their age and origin. Then, lawyer Ye Fukan briefly stated the main points of the prosecution. Then, defendant's lawyer Fan Qisheng also rose to state the main points of the counterclaim and presented a newspaper with a statement published by lawyer Zhang Yuanmei on behalf of Ren Shuzhen in July of last year stating that she had severed the relationship between husband and concubine. Then, Chen Yindi complained that Yao Shunxi had repeatedly asked her to go to Zhang's residence to play and lured her to the salted meat shop, but she had noticed and escaped. However, Yao Zhang did not go with her, etc. Yao Zhang and Yao Shunxi both denied the accusations. Shunxi also confessed that she was a virgin, and the plaintiff's lawyer Ye immediately rose to declare that according to Shunxi's confession that she was still a virgin, the lawyers could ask the plaintiff to be responsible for guaranteeing that she was not a virgin and could ask the doctor to examine her. If she had a relationship with many people, she would be willing to bear the responsibility of false accusation if it was found to be untrue. The place is a famous salted meat shop. If the court wants to understand the content, it can ask to go there for inspection. Judge Luo verified the confession and announced that the case would be rescheduled for further interrogation on the afternoon of June 4 and ordered Lao Si to be summoned to court for questioning.</p>

<h3>Stabbed a Concubine With a Knife</h3>
<p>Skull Shattered and Index Finger Cut Off</p>
<p>The Murderer Surrendered After Causing the Trouble</p>
<p>Confessed That It Was Caused by Extreme Hatred</p>
<p>The Concubine's Injuries Were Very Serious</p>
<p>Zhou Yueying, a woman from Ningbo, is 23 years old. In March of last year, she took a boat from her hometown to Shanghai to seek refuge with her fellow villager Ou A-Wu, intending to ask Ou to introduce her to work as a servant. Ou, who was working as a small worker at a tea shop at No. 1219 Haining Road, saw that Zhou was still young and had a beautiful appearance, so he made the excuse that Zhou was not familiar with the Shanghai dialect and it was better to live with him. The woman agreed, so they lived together and rented a house at No. 53 Houde Lane, Xiaocai Market, Yongxing Road, Zhabei, as if they were husband and wife with strong love. Two months ago, Zhou's mother suddenly came to Shanghai from Ningbo and also lived with her daughter. After only a few days, there were cracks in their relationship. On the night of the 26th of this month, Ou came home from work, but Zhou and her daughter had disappeared, and all the clothes and utensils in the room were gone. He realized that Zhou had an affair and was filled with anger, vowing to hurt her. He took a kitchen knife from his home and went to the store, secretly investigating Zhou's whereabouts. At around 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, Ou was free from work in the store, so he went for a stroll nearby and suddenly saw Zhou coming out of a movie theater. Ou ran back to the store, grabbed the kitchen knife, and hurried to chase her. He was caught up with her on North Henan Road and Aierjin Road. At that time, Zhou also knew it and hurriedly avoided into Rongqing Lane. Ou also chased in and suddenly cut Zhou's head several times with the kitchen knife. Zhou used her left hand to cover, and one section of her index finger was completely cut off. Her head was also seriously injured, and she fell to the ground in extreme pain, with blood gushing out like a spring. Ou surrendered to the Huisi Police Station with the murder weapon, stating the whole story directly. The police chief obtained the confession and immediately sent detective Wang Jie to investigate the scene. The injured person had been sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by Indian police No. 397. Only a large pool of blood was seen in the alley, and a section of the cut-off finger was found in the blood, which was taken back to the police station. He ordered Ou to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 2 of the Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that Zhou was seriously injured and unable to speak at the hospital, requesting an indefinite postponement. He then presented the doctor's examination form and the murder weapon finger. The knife was stained with a lot of blood and a lock of hair. The doctor's examination form briefly stated that Zhou's head was deeply split, her skull was shattered, and her left index finger was also cut off. Her injuries were very serious, etc. The defendant admitted the previous situation and said that he was extremely angry and dizzy at the time and probably cut three or four times, etc. Judge Luo Renji verified the confession and announced that Ou Wu would be detained pending Zhou Yueying's recovery, and appointed lawyer Fan Gang as the defendant's defense lawyer in court. The murder weapon and the section of the index finger were temporarily stored in the forensic department of this court.</p>
<p>Coincidentally</p>
<h3>Pockmarked Woman Requests Divorce</h3>
<p>Because Her Face Is Pockmarked, Her Husband Dislikes Her</p>
<p>Two Women Should Sympathize With Each Other</p>
<p>Yang Zhu's Has Reconciled</p>
<p>Yan Zhu's Case Still Needs to Be Retried</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court accepts several divorce cases every day. The women are the majority of the petitioners, and the reasons are mostly abuse, beatings, abandonment, neglect, intention to sell, and pampering concubines and abusing wives. Yesterday, two cases of women requesting divorce were heard. The most bizarre thing is that both women have pockmarked faces, and one of the defendants disliked his wife's ugly appearance and took a concubine home to live with, and then began to abuse his wife. The other defendant also disliked his wife's unsightly appearance and had an affair with a prostitute outside and brought her home to live with. As a result, the feelings between the husband and wife were broken. The following are the details of the plaintiff's intentions and interrogations in the above two cases.</p>
<p>(1) Yang Zhu, a woman from Pudong, retained lawyer Shen Qi to sue her husband, Yang A-Gen, for all kinds of abuse and unbearable cohabitation. She requested a divorce and the return of her dowry and clothing, stating that she was betrothed to the defendant by her mother from a young age. At the age of 13, she went to the defendant's home as a child bride. She got married at the age of 19. At the time of the child bride and the early marriage, the parents-in-law and the defendant were still harmonious. However, in the spring of last year, the defendant had an affair with Wu Yao, the wife of Wu Xihua, and took her back to live together, as if they were husband and wife. She regarded the plaintiff as a thorn in her side and was often beaten by the defendant, the concubine, and the aunt. Moreover, she could not get enough food. The abuse became even worse. She was tied to the foot of the bed with a rope and beaten violently, causing injuries all over her body. The plaintiff called for help and was released by the superintendent Yang Huang and others. The next day, she went to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. She has a diagnosis certificate. The plaintiff applied for mediation earlier, but the defendant refused to reconcile. The defendant and his concubine habitually beat the plaintiff, and the method of beating was to tie her to the foot of the bed and make her unable to get enough food. It is truly unbearable cohabitation and should be allowed to divorce according to law. Yesterday, Judge Wang opened the court to interrogate. Yang Zhu confessed that she was 23 years old, a local and lived at the ferry crossing of Dongjiadu, Pudong. She is currently working in a cloth factory and has been married to the defendant for four years. Zhu gave birth to a child, but the defendant disliked her ugly appearance and had an affair with a woman recently and had a son. She also confessed the previous situation. According to Yang A-Gen's confession, he is 30 years old, a local and lives at No. 786 Tangqiao Town, Pudong, making a living by driving a boat. Our relationship has always been harmonious and there has never been any beating. As for my concubine, she has already been separated. I do not want to divorce. The judge obtained the confession and repeatedly advised the plaintiff that quarrels between husband and wife are common in the family. This court orders the defendant not to beat you again in the future and to separate the concubine. It is better for the husband and wife to reconcile and not divorce. The plaintiff said, what if I am beaten again? The judge said, you can come and tell me again. The plaintiff nodded, so a reconciliation was reached and the husband and wife reconciled. The judge then wrote a reconciliation record and ordered both parties to sign and leave the court. (2) Yan Zhu, a local young woman, is 24 years old this year and currently lives at No. 20 Zhujiazhai, Zhijiang Temple, Zhabei. Yan A-Wu is a local. This spring, A-Wu took a young star home to live with him. The good family has been in trouble ever since. Yan Zhu retained lawyer Yao Jian to request mediation for a divorce from the Local Court Mediation Office. The reason is that her husband, Yan A-Wu, committed bigamy and abuse. She requested a divorce and a return of alimony of 4,000 yuan (calculated at 200 yuan per year for 20 years) and a return of dowry ornaments worth 1,800 yuan. The statement stated that the defendant usually disliked her ugly appearance and often said that he would marry a beautiful woman. The defendant has more than ten acres of ancestral land, worth tens of thousands of gold. The family is quite well-off. In early February of this year, the defendant took all of her gold ornaments and sold them to marry another woman outside. On the 19th of this month, he made the Qingming Festival at home and took the woman home, clearly deceiving her weakness. Before long, she was severely beaten by the defendant and the woman. At that time, she went to the Procuratorate to verify the wounds and was advised to go home and reconcile. Unexpectedly, after returning home, the defendant intensified and severely beat her before imprisoning her in a room. Later, the neighbors heard about it and helped her out. According to the civil law on kinship, there is no concubinage system. All bigamy or adultery and abuse are conditions for divorce. Moreover, the cause of divorce is that one party can request future alimony in accordance with the precedents of the former Dali Court and the current civil law on kinship, which should also be borne by the defendant. Yesterday, Judge Chen Bingxin opened the court for mediation. The petitioner did not arrive, and her agent, lawyer Yao, arrived to interrogate. Yan A-Wu confessed that he was 24 years old, a local and lived in Yanjiachun, and was currently an apprentice at HSBC Bank. He has been married for six years. (Question) The petitioner requested a divorce and alimony of 4,000 yuan and a dowry of 1,800 yuan. What do you think? (Answer) I don't want to divorce. (Question) Do you still have a woman at home? (Answer) Yes, she taught me to marry her. (Question) What is this woman's name? (Answer) Her name is Chen Sanyuan and she is nominally a concubine. (Question) Do you live together? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Do you beat her? (Answer) I don't beat her. I go out to do business during the day and she takes the clothes back to her mother's house, such as a pair of gold bracelets, four gold rings, a gold hair clip, a gold lock, a gold chain, etc., weighing more than seven taels, and more than 500 yuan. (Question) Are you saying that she ran away with these things? (Answer) Yes. At this point, lawyer Yao rose to say that the petitioner is a pockmarked face, which is inevitable and not beautiful, so she does not please the defendant. So the defendant took the petitioner's gold ornaments one after another, but the Chen Sanyuan who is now married is very beautiful. The two are increasingly disliked in comparison. Please the court to investigate. The judge announced that he would summon and verify further.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County Plans to Build Puxi Telephone</h3>
<p>Total Line Length: 92 Li</p>
<p>The Puxi telephone project planned and constructed by the Shanghai County Construction Bureau was yesterday submitted to the county by Director Wu Wenhua along with the project proposal. The entire route consists of six sections: (1) From Beiqiao to Zhuanqiao, 6 li; (2) From Beiqiao to Minhang, 9 li; (3) From Beiqiao to Changqiao, connecting to the Shanghai urban area telephone network, 27.5 li; (4) From Beiqiao to Huajing, 22.5 li; (5) From Beiqiao to Tangwan, 10.5 li; (6) From Beiqiao to 认大 Yao Factory, 16.5 li. The total length is 92 li. Due to the county's financial difficulties, funding must be approved by the Provincial Construction Department. It is expected that funds will be raised from the province, county, and local communities. It is reported that the cost of materials and expenses for the Puxi section alone will be around 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Continental Commercial Center's Layout</h3>
<p>The Continental Bank is currently constructing the Continental Commercial Center at the corner of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road, and construction has already begun. The commercial center covers an area of six mu and has six floors. It faces Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, and Shandong Road on three sides. A T-shaped alley will be opened inside to connect the three roads. The alley will be three English feet wide and will have a parking lot for many cars. Sidewalks will be built on both sides of the alley. This alley will be named Buddha Street. Large elevators will be built at the three entrances, capable of lifting 120 people to each floor in one minute. Various shops will be built along the roads and alleys. The second floor will be used by the Continental Bank. The third and fourth floors and a portion of the second floor will have the latest and most novel equipment. Once the building is completed, a cooperative commercial center consisting of 300 shops will be established, with each shop conveniently displaying its goods. The fifth and sixth floors will have more than 100 large and small office spaces. A garden, dance hall, restaurant, club, cinema, and miniature golf course will be built on the roof. It is reported that several stores have already secured rooms in the commercial center, and it is expected that all floors will be fully occupied within the year.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit over Xue's Estate Lost</h3>
<p>The woman Wang A'mei previously retained lawyer Pan Cheng'e to represent her in the civil court of the French Concession, claiming that the plaintiff was the concubine of the late paint merchant Xue Bao'run. After living together, they had a daughter named Bao'bao. Since Xue's death, no one has provided for her, and she requested that Xue's estate be divided according to the law. Xue's wife, Sun, Xue's sons Jia Sheng, Yan Sheng, Gan Sheng, and Gen Sheng, also retained lawyer Lin Yingqing to represent them. After repeated summonses, arguments were finally heard and a ruling was awaited. Yesterday, the date of the ruling arrived, and both parties were summoned. Judge Gong announced the ruling, stating that in the case of the dispute between the two parties over the division of property, after the court's review, the ruling is as follows: "Ruling:" The plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed, and the litigation costs are borne by the plaintiff. The court order for provisional attachment is revoked. "Facts:" The dispute between the two parties in this case should first be based on the plaintiff's identity. As for whether Xue Bao'run made a will before his death, and whether the will was made before the implementation of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code, these two points must be considered after the plaintiff's identity is determined. Now, the plaintiff claims to share the inheritance obtained by the defendants as Xue Bao'run's daughter. The defendants not only deny that she is Xue Bao'run's daughter but also state that her legal representative is not her biological mother, which is supported by evidence. The plaintiff has not presented any evidence and has not requested the summoning of any witnesses, relying only on two photographs as evidence of her mother-daughter and father-daughter relationship. How can this be considered sufficient? Confirming identity has a significant impact on individuals and families. How can photographs be the only evidence to determine identity? Since the plaintiff's identity cannot be verified, there is no doubt that she is not Xue Bao'run's daughter. How can she share the inheritance with the defendants? In summary, the ruling is made as stated in the main text.</p>

<p>Municipal Public Works Bureau Relief</p>
<h3>Water Shortage in Xiangyan Bridge, Jiyang Lane</h3>
<p>Urging Owners to Install More Public Faucets</p>
<p>There are twenty street-facing shops and sixteen lane houses, with about a hundred households, in Jiyang Lane, Xiangyan Bridge, Zhabei. Initially, they used well water, but due to the unclean water quality, the rent was increased by one yuan per month for each building to use tap water, with two public faucets installed. Later, the owners wanted to increase the rent again due to excessive water bills, but the tenants refused. As a result, one of the faucets was removed. In March of this year, residents of the lane requested the restoration of the removed faucet due to insufficient water supply, but the owners refused. They then reported to the Municipal Health Bureau, which forwarded the matter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for handling. The bureau investigated and confirmed the situation and ordered the owners to install a public faucet for drinking water. The owners argued that after the installation of tap water faucets, tenants were using the water excessively, and the 粉皮 (rice noodle sheets) shop at No. 158 and the 大饼 (large pancake) wholesale shop at No. 155 were consuming even more water due to their business operations. How could they bear the huge water bills? They requested to be exempted from installing additional faucets. The bureau then informed the owners that the water used by the 粉皮 shop, etc., was for business purposes and that the shop should install its own meter for water usage. As for the water fees for the other households, which were included in the rent, the faucet should be installed quickly to ensure sufficient supply. However, the owner has delayed in doing so, and the residents have been complaining. Yesterday, it was learned that the Public Works Bureau ordered the owner, Wu Zhongyang, to install another faucet by the end of this month and notified the residents that if the owner fails to comply by the deadline, the residents can install it themselves and deduct all expenses from the rent. However, those whose water usage is for business purposes must install their own water meters to ensure fairness.</p>
<h3>New Slaughterhouse to be Built on Dixiwei Road</h3>
<p>According to the 大美晩报 (Shanghai Evening Post), the new slaughterhouse being built by the 工部局 Engineering Department on Dixiwei Road has already started construction. It covers an area of fourteen mu and costs 1,349,500 taels. After completion, it will be able to slaughter 970 cattle, 900 sheep, 300 pigs, and 300 calves per day, more than double the capacity of the existing Pelun Road slaughterhouse. According to last year's statistics, a total of 46,990 cattle, 46,000 sheep, 10,000 calves, and 25,000 pigs were slaughtered in the Public Concession. Therefore, the new slaughterhouse buildings are planned to be built in two stories, with the remaining two stories reserved for future expansion.</p>
<h3>Wang Yongsheng's Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>Wang Yongsheng, who runs the Beiyang Hotel in Ning'an Lane, west of the North Railway Station, left alone on the morning of the 23rd of last month and sent a letter to his wife claiming suicide. More than a month has passed, and his whereabouts are still unknown. His wife, Fu, and children are crying day and night, in extreme distress. In addition to reporting to the Public Security Bureau to search for him, they hope that anyone who knows his whereabouts will notify them in order to reunite the family.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the Yangtze River basin is cloudy and hot with thunderstorms. The coastal areas of the country are calm and windless. There is a cyclone in the Sea of Japan, moving east or northeast due to low pressure. The temperature in Shanghai for the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was a high of 90.5 and a low of 65.7. On the same day last year, the high was 82.4 and the low was 55.8.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I respectfully inform you that we have received a letter from Mr. Chen Zhuzhen of the Fucheng Company in Padang Serai, Kedah, Malaya, stating that his brother, Chen Qingji, previously studied at the Rili Minli Chinese School in the Dutch East Indies' Sumatra, but dropped out halfway. He went to Surabaya to do business for several years but was unsuccessful. He then stayed there for several months before returning to China to study, claiming to be studying at Jinan University. It has been three years since then, and there has been no news. He longs for family reunion and is saddened by the lack of news from the north. He wrote to us to inquire about his whereabouts, hoping for a reunion. We have checked the Jinan University registry and cannot find anyone named Chen Qingji. We admire your newspaper's enthusiasm for social welfare and its kindness in helping others. We have provided you with the details of the matter and respectfully request that you publish it in your newspaper so that he or his relatives can learn of his current situation and inform us so that we can forward it to him. We would be grateful, and not only we but also his elderly parents and young children across the ocean would be indebted to your newspaper and Mr. Editors.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<h3>The Eccentric Man on the Chimney</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>I have seen the eccentric man on the Japanese chimney twice. The first time was around January of this year. He stood on the chimney, neither eating nor drinking, for seven days before coming down. I called him a new-style Shen Baoxu. Recently, a 19-year-old dyer climbed the chimney due to an ineffective strike, breaking the previous record. Despite police persuasion and medical advice, he insisted on waiting for a satisfactory settlement before being lowered in a rope basket. All of these people harbored great aspirations and sacrificed their own interests, vowing to achieve their goals at all costs and placing themselves in extreme danger, as if hanging on the edge of a cliff. Since these events are rarely seen, the public regards them as eccentric. The newspaper criticized this action, saying that while it may not be unprecedented, it is certainly rare. Is it really rare? Tao Zaidong says no. In ancient times, there were no chimneys, but there were pagodas. Their solitary height and danger are equal to chimneys. Although Shen Baoxu cried for seven days without drinking a drop of water, he was still standing on flat ground, which is not worth mentioning. Yang Ruizhong's ascent of the Buddhist pagoda is also an eccentric act. Yang Ruizhong was from Zhending Prefecture in the Southern Song Dynasty. In November of the second year of Jianyan, the Jin people besieged Puzhou. Yang Ruizhong defended it. The Jin people attacked for thirty-two days. Yang Ruizhong climbed to the highest level of the pagoda from the northwest corner of the city. The city then fell. Yang Ruizhong did not descend when the Jin people called him. The Jin people, respecting his loyalty, promised not to kill him, and then he descended. The details are in the "Three Dynasties Northern Alliance Compilation," Volume 119. Comparing and criticizing, the object of the chimney is the Japanese, while the object of the pagoda is the Jin. The enemy of the gold cave is the Jin people. Are the events and people not even stranger? I once said that China's historical data is the richest. Except for electrical machinery, all events, large and small, trivial and bizarre, exist. The word "unprecedented" is not easy to say. Scholars of history should not be tired of reading more books.</p>
<h3>A Celebration of the Du Ancestral Hall</h3>
<p>— Lishan Nong</p>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng's public-spiritedness and righteousness are widely praised. Whenever various provinces appeal for disaster relief, he generously donates huge sums of money, cherishing Du Fu's desire for ten thousand rooms to shelter the poor and Bai Juyi's wish for a thousand-zhang-long quilt to keep them warm. He is not only surrounded by three thousand followers, rivaling Lord Mengchang of Qi during the Warring States period. Recently, he built an ancestral hall in Pudong to honor his ancestors and enlighten his descendants. The completion ceremony will be held on the fifth day of the second week of May. Friends from all over the country have sent gifts in advance, but Mr. Du has declined them all, only accepting poems and eulogies that can be kept as memorials. Yesterday, I passed by his residence and saw various treasures displayed in the hall, a dazzling array of beautiful objects. Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang personally inscribed plaques. Other important figures from the party, government, and military, as well as chambers of commerce from various provinces, all competed to offer couplets and poems, all of which were well-written and worthy of being passed down for generations. There were also gilded screen panels with vermilion silk borders, inscribed with Zhu Bolu's Family Instructions, mostly written by the writer Wang Xishen. In addition, Feng Yunchu and Wang Xishen sent a bronze stele with an inscription praising him: "Five hundred years of auspiciousness, the phoenix bird comes. Eleven clans of Shu Xiang, only the Yangshe remain. Black clothes and vermilion birds, the Wang and Xie families flourished in the Six Dynasties. Decorated carriages and red wheels, the Jin and Zhang families prospered in the Han Dynasty. The brilliance of the clan and the importance of the genealogy have always been valued. Since the world steals days and loses its order, the shrine of Tingjian is suddenly abandoned. The ancestors of Ruo Ao are finally hungry. Seeking fallen leaves on old branches, who can protect them? Asking for the same roots in different mounds, the Qiumu has no Yi 緦 hemp heart, and the children of the road. The elders who love their relatives sigh with emotion. Mr. Yuesheng, his clan is as high as the heavenly phenomena and his spirit is as strong as mountains and rivers. Continuing the ancestors of Rong, he cares for the descendants. Following the family spinning, he has a good model. Therefore, he built an ancestral hall in Kerry. The autumn frost and spring dew are originally Xie Gong's sincerity to stop the ancestors. He sees the love and hears the warning of Li's complete belonging. The spirits will always shine brightly and the spirit will be connected. Considering those who count their ancestors and forget their ancestors, they divination and get the surname, and the distant descendants ask Min Ziqian and do not know it. He continues Cui Wu, and he is even more ashamed. Is it not enough to encourage thin customs and promote Muhang? The Yao Yuan nine factions move the thinking of Longmen heaven. A branch of Guilin is like the spirit of the Lu Palace." The poems of praise are inexhaustible, and the etiquette is detailed in the washing and the offering. Dare to use this righteousness to make a eulogy. Said: "The houses are in pairs, and the poems are followed by Bai Ye. Strive to become Confucian heroes, save the time, and the clan hegemon. Describe virtue and inscribe meritorious deeds, and expand the mansion. The sun of love rises in the hall, and the clouds are rising in the hall. The Mao and Chong shades are spread, and the Shengge Sanya filial piety is practiced in auspicious order. The Shilu Qianyi respects the ancestors. The pictures of paintings show the brilliance of Wenyi. The brilliance of Lin Zhao at night rests, the east of Pupu admires the Gui Xian community. The Yunzhang Xian scale, the dew is scattered, and the musk is respectfully offered. At the time of summer, the Fen Cui is attached, and the words of the mint are arranged. The algae are scattered, and the regular script is beautiful. It is the most refined of the small works, and it is also written by Xishen." I heard that his disciples are also planning to raise more than 100,000 yuan to build a library next to the ancestral hall to help the development of culture and promote the popularization of education. The sound of iron zithers and copper swords will follow the ancients, and one day Jiangsu Province will have another famous site.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of Curing Snake Poison</h3>
<p>— Fang Shen'an</p>
<p>Recently, in the "Free Talk" section of the 申報 Newspaper on May 18th, there was an article titled "Discussion of the Diagnosis and Treatment of Difficult Diseases," which was written by Mr. Ban Kuang, describing my medical cases of curing various difficult and strange diseases in recent years. One of the cases mentioned a woman suffering from 中蛊, whom I cured with a single needle, causing her to vomit poisonous snakes. This article was not detailed enough, so I am supplementing it to let readers know that all kinds of strange and difficult diseases can be cured using the old acupuncture methods passed down in China for 5,000 years, and there is often an unexpected effect. The patient was an elderly woman from Guangdong Province who said that she had been suffering from chest and abdominal pain for seven years. When the pain occurred, her face turned pale and she wanted to die but could not. She could only eat a small amount of beef and mutton to temporarily relieve the pain. She had been treated by many Chinese and Western doctors, but without any effect. I diagnosed her pulse as being large and small, slow and rapid, changing in an instant, and her complexion was also sometimes green and sometimes white, changing from time to time. I knew that her illness was not caused by ordinary abdominal masses or all kinds of stomach cold and stagnation. Moreover, since she was from Guangdong, where the harm of 中蛊 is often present, her pulse and complexion were both signs of worm disease. I guessed that her chest and abdominal pain was probably caused by 中蛊. Therefore, I used a large needle to penetrate deeply into the Zhongwan acupoint. Unexpectedly, as soon as the needle was inserted, the pain became unbearable. After a short while, she vomited a small amount of greenish water, which had an unbearable odor. After a while, a small snake wriggled out of her mouth, becoming longer and longer. The entire body was two feet long. After moving for about ten minutes, it died. An inch away from the snake's head was a wound, which was where I had inserted the needle. After the snake came out, not only did the pain stop immediately, but her chest and abdomen also felt comfortable and she thanked me sincerely. I used fire and alcohol to soak the Gu in a glass bottle and took a photograph to keep as a memento.</p>
<h3>Complete Chinese Translation of the Quran Published</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Islam is prevalent in northwestern China, and there are many followers in Henan, Jinling, Jinan, etc. There are mosques throughout the country, which shows the breadth of its teachings. The Quran, consisting of thirty volumes, is followed, but it is passed down in Arabic. Not only are scholars unable to understand it, but even those within the religion may not be able to fully understand it. In the past, two masters, Liu Jielian and Ma Fuchu, made abridged translations, but they were not complete. Translations in English and Japanese are very prevalent, which makes the Chinese feel ashamed. Recently, Mr. and Mrs. Hardoon hired many talented individuals who were proficient in Islam to translate the Quran, which took three years to complete. The Quran now has a complete Chinese translation. It can not only rival the English and Japanese translations but also reveal the secrets of the past 1,300 years to the Chinese people and those within the religion. The entire book consists of 6,666 verses, covering doctrines, rules, history, and myths. In short, much of it is unknown to the people of China. Its benefits to the religion are self-evident. Even politicians, religious figures, historians, and philosophers can use it to understand the essence of the ancient sages and the broad and profound teachings. The publication of this complete edition can truly be called enlightening the teachings. The entire book is in eight volumes and includes prefaces and postscripts by famous people, which can serve as a guide for scholars. I believe that the book will spread far and wide on its own.</p>
<h3>Around the Yellow Sea (16)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>A friend of mine took office as the magistrate of a certain county in Zhejiang and asked me to give him a few words. I, never being one to be polite, gave him a long lecture: "There are three types of officials. The first is called '官' (official), the second is called '官官' (official-official), and the third is called '民官' (people's official)."</p>
<p>What is called "官"? "This person is full of official air." "Congratulations on your promotion and fortune." This may be what Zuo Zongtang said. "Can't you even be an official?" This is called "官," and it's everywhere, so I don't need to say more.</p>
<p>What is called "官官"? That is a higher level. He really wants to do things for the government and may be very good at doing things for the government. Every power that the government should have is taken over one by one. Every penny that the government should have is taken over, even if it is not supposed to have it, as long as the power of the government can get it, he will unceremoniously take it all over. He is a loyal minister of the officialdom, he is a loyal servant of the government. In his heart and eyes, there is only one 民府 (people's government) because he is an official of the government, so he is called "官官."</p>
<p>As for the third type, 民官, that is very different. In his heart and eyes, there are only the people. He only knows how to do things for the people. So the previous type should be called an official's servant, while he should be called a public servant. The previous type should be called 官官, while he should be called 民官.</p>
<p>You certainly won't be a "官," but will you be a "官官" or a "民官"? Please choose for yourself, my friend. This is all what I said to my friend.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Japan and saw how they worked in the officialdom, a fourth type of official appeared, which is called "国民" (national citizen). They completely do things for the country but are not official servants, nor are they worthy of being called public servants. They should only be called "国僕" (national servant).</p>
<p>Next to the desks of all their civil and military officials are large maps of Manchuria and Mongolia. When they are silent for a few minutes, they are all thinking about Manchuria and Mongolia, which are the future of our country.</p>
<p>On both sides of the street, the entrances to trams and public buses are very large, and advertisements are prominently displayed: "The Railway Bureau is launching a Manchuria-Mongolia sightseeing tour. The departure date, the return date, the places visited, the discount on fares, and other preferential treatment are listed, limited to a certain number of people. Sign up quickly!" This is a common occurrence, not an accidental one.</p>
<p>"Manchuria-Mongolia Affairs Lecture Topic (1) Observing Soybeans from the Perspective of Manchurian-Mongolian Resources (2) The Importance of Manchuria-Mongolia and Japanese Diplomacy Sponsor: [Name of Association] Supporter: [Name of Government Office]" This is what I saw in the countryside.</p>
<p>The tram safety movement was launched nationwide, with large advertisements posted everywhere: "April 20th to 26th is the Tram Safety Period. Absolutely no accidents are allowed. It is hoped that all employees will work together to achieve this. Sponsor: Transportation Administration Office." This is our nation's moment of rights! This is our nation's moment of glory! A group of national officials are imagining this. Our country's administrative organs are too busy. How can they manage this kind of national affair?</p>

<h3>The Future World (2)</h3>
<p>— Tian Xuwo Sheng</p>
<p>The first time, I used fluorite and sulfuric acid to make frosted glass, but it was easy to get dirty and troublesome to clean. The second time, I used fluorite and bone ash to make opaque milky white porcelain, but it was still easy to get dirty, and it looked like a baker's shop. Finally, I added cobalt oxide to make opaque blue, which I found satisfactory. It was even more beautiful than Indanthrene-dyed fabrics. As for the cost, it was extremely cheap. Each vat of glass material cost only twelve yuan, but it weighed four hundred pounds. Each pound cost only four cents, which was cheaper than paper. At first, I used cottonseed hulls instead of coal. But when I made a large batch of potassium glass and then a batch of lead glass, I first used a press to press them into round table-sized convex glass. I used sunlight to capture the sun's heat to burn the glass, which didn't cost a penny. Because clothes made of soft glass threads are not easily torn, if they are damaged, they only need to be returned to the furnace without needing potassium carbonate again. Therefore, cottonseed hulls were also eliminated. Moreover, I don't like social engagements, so I don't need to constantly change my clothes. Therefore, crucibles, presses, convex lenses, etc. were also eliminated. Isn't this solving the problem of clothing? As for the problem of food, I watched a movie about the new world fifty years later and looked up the "Emergency Relief Method" in Volume Sixteen of "Verification of New Prescriptions." It said that only glutinous rice, sesame, and red dates are needed to make pills, each weighing five qian. Taking one pill a day can prevent hunger for a day. It was originally very cheap, but it still seemed troublesome to make and eat. So I changed to the method of Baopuzi, which only involves touching the tip of the tongue to the upper palate every morning to produce saliva in the mouth. Swallow it slowly in dozens of mouthfuls several times in a row. This can gradually reduce hunger. At first, you can stop eating breakfast. Gradually, you can swallow this Huachi saliva no matter where you are, sitting or lying down. It has actually become a Taoist habit of 服氣 (breathing exercises). Therefore, you don't eat and you don't get hungry. So not only is the problem of food solved, but the problem of drink is also solved at the same time. Therefore, I have no dregs in my chest and no need for excretion. Tap water, fire, and toilets, chamber pots, rice bowls, tea cups, etc. are also completely eliminated. Because my residence has saved many cumbersome things and I am accustomed to meditation, practicing the "gentleman enters rest" rule, I don't need a bed. It's not meditation, nor is it a single-lotus or double-lotus sitting position. Just casually bending your arms and resting your head, or leaning on a table and lying down, can nourish your spirit. It's truly like a dragon horse, and even better than a dragon horse. Although the dragon horse doesn't close its eyes to sleep, it still needs to roll over. I don't need to roll over. I only need to rest for a while and I'm fine. So there is only one table and one chair in the house, which is enough to accommodate me. A square zhang room already feels large and inappropriate. In fact, only a mat is enough. At first, I wanted to build a castle in the air because I had to wait fifty years before there were air police. I was afraid that an airplane would crash into me. I thought that if an airplane crashed into the mast of a sand boat, the airplane would break, but the sand boat would not capsize. It's better to live in a boat. So I used a pontoon boat as a base, with glass windows on three sides and a brick wall made of magnesium cement on one side. I used louvered windows instead of rafters and tiles. I closed them when it rained and opened them when I wanted wind. It's really interesting on a beautiful spring and autumn day. Zhang Zhihe's floating home is a good method.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Plunges After Peak</h3>
<p>Falls Back 14.9 Taels</p>
<p>Dramatic Fluctuations: Yesterday, the 28th, spot gold prices experienced a strong shift from a peak to a slump. The intense volatility was chaotic and uncontrollable. Price swings of several taels were common, totaling over 24 taels throughout the day, culminating in a sharp drop of 15 taels. Industry players were bewildered. Overall, large holders aggressively sold off, reversing the previous surge. This massive change was hardly unexpected; the silver market decline immediately opened higher, then surged to 812 taels, breaking yesterday's new record. Subsequently, foreign exchange remained tight despite a slight reduction in quotations. The aggressive selling by Dahing, Yongyuan Hing, and Yong Hing, among others, was unaffected. It is rumored that the Central Bank and Yu Feng Yong, along with other bullish entities, were offloading their positions, forcing the market environment into a tempestuous situation. After a catastrophic plunge of over 10 taels, the price dramatically broke through 800 taels, leading to further market weakness and widespread panic, plummeting to below 790 taels. Selling pressure remained intense, almost leading to a complete collapse. The foreign exchange situation further deteriorated, causing a standstill in cash flow. Holders were eager to liquidate, significantly impacting futures.</p>
<p>New High Price Achieved: Since the market opened in early July, the price had increased by 5 taels and 1 mace to 809 taels, due to a substantial drop of one-eighth in silver prices and a simultaneous one-quarter drop in public and private telegram rates. Subsequently, the price reached 808 taels, driven by purchases from Dade Cheng, Yuanheng, Tianfeng, Yongyuan, Cheng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, and others, mainly because British gold was very strong. Banks initially offered 0.0625, then bought in at the same price, immediately driving the price up to 12 taels, setting a new record. Afterward, the price was suppressed by a little over 3 taels, as Wan Hing, Qian Chang, Xiang Shun Li, Heng Yu, and others sold, particularly since British gold could be settled at 0.0625. When the announcement reached 0.0867 taels, the quotation was reduced by 125 US dollars, and the 25th-day gold increased by 1.75 fen. However, the domestic market no longer saw tightness, only increasing by 45 fen to 0.09 taels, then dropping again to 0.07 taels. Later, it was found that Chun Yuan and Yong Yuan Cheng Yong, among others, bought in, and MacKay bought British gold at 0.0625 to 0.125. Therefore, at around 9:50, the price was 10 taels and 6 mace. After 10 o'clock, the market became extremely turbulent. Selling pressure suddenly intensified on the trading floor, with Heng Hing, Yuanheng, Chang Sheng, Yongyuan, Kang Xiang, Yuan Mao Yong, Hong Li Shun Li, Wan Hing, as well as Yuan Hing Yong and Dahing Yong, and others competing to sell. There were rumors that the Central Bank was heavily selling bullish positions, and Yu Feng Yong was also aggressively liquidating, causing the price to collapse dramatically, plummeting over 15 taels, breaking through 800 taels. However, there was an underlying support of 1 or 2 taels, and banks bought British gold at 0.025 to 0.03125. By around 11:30, the price finally reached 95 taels. Afterward, banks absorbed 0.025, and Yuanheng and Qian Chang Xiang, Dade Cheng, and others bought in, pushing the price back up by 4 taels. At 11:45, the price was 99 taels. The noon closing was at 97 taels and 3 mace, as sellers were again eager. After the market closed, the price was re-adjusted to 847 taels and 8 mace, a drop of over 40 to 50 taels.</p>
<p>Strong Rebound in the Afternoon Market: The afternoon market opened at 97 taels, then rose to 4 taels and 8 mace, as Indian exchange rates were reported to be high. Shortly afterward, the price returned to 97 taels. After 2:15, the market became increasingly volatile, with Yuan Hing Yong, Dahing Yong, Chun Yuan Yong Yuan, Kang Xiang Cheng, Feng Yong Tong, Tai Chang Shun Li, Wan Hing, and other large holders selling in concert. The absence of buyers made things worse. Additionally, the Central Bank sold British gold at 0.375 to 0.4375, which HSBC and Mitsui absorbed, further fueling fear. The price plummeted by 8 to 9 taels, suddenly reaching 87 taels and 5 mace at 3 o'clock. There were occasional advances and retreats of 2 to 3 taels. Afterward, banks absorbed 0.375 to 0.3125, and Zhifeng Yong Yuanheng, Fuchang Fuyu, and the Dalian gang came in to support, pushing the price up by 6 to 7 taels. However, there was a fluctuation of over 2 taels. At 4 o'clock, the price was 94 taels and 5 mace. The selling side quickly became stronger again, and the British gold bank's buying price needed 0.375. The industry sentiment trended downward, so the market closed at 4:30 at only 789 taels, a drop of about 9 taels to 91 taels. However, the market situation was extremely confusing and difficult to predict. Compared to the previous day's close, the price plummeted by 14 taels and 9 mace (according to the listed price). The difference between the highest price of 812 taels and the lowest price of 787 taels and 5 mace for the whole city was 24 taels and 5 mace, which was also a huge difference. The price of goods in the early market was 0.085 taels, the noon closing was 96.5 taels, the afternoon price was 0.075 taels, and the closing price was 0.095 taels. The listed price was reduced by about 60 taels. The recorded price was 95 taels to 97 taels in the morning and 87 taels to 89 taels in the afternoon. The margin call was 93 taels in the morning and 85 taels in the afternoon, so there was a double settlement price.</p>
<p>Large Holders Aggressively Liquidating: Each firm's trading was dominated by supply exceeding demand. Dahing Yong and Yuan Hing Yong were rumored to be selling on behalf of the Central Bank and Yu Feng Yong in very large quantities. Chang Sheng Yong Cheng, Feng Yong Heng Yu, Qian Chang Xiang, Heng Hing Yuan, Yu Da Heng Hing Wan Li, Run Chang Yu Tong, and Tai Chang also sold. Wu also liquidated. Wan Hing Shun Li, Dade Cheng Yuan Mao, Yongfu Tai, and Heng Yuan Tai were actively buying and selling. Fuchang and Yuanheng were both hedging. However, there were also occasional buyers. Zhifeng Yong Tian, Feng Yong Bing Hing, Chun Yuan Yong Fuyu were all buyers. Cuichang Yong bought in first and then sold out. In the afternoon, Yuan Mao Yong Wan Hing Shun Li, Yuanheng Fuchang Shun Mao all bought in. Dahing Yong Yuan Hing Yong Cheng, Feng Yong Yi, Yu Yuan Kang Xiang Chun Yuan, Yong Heng Yu still had sales. It was rumored that the Central Bank sold more than 4,000 shares. The Guangdong gang only sold 600 to 700 shares. The Dalian gang sold 3,000 shares and bought 3,300 shares.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Shows Signs of Tightness and Relaxation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British and American silver markets reported declines, and exchange rates also fell. HSBC's listed price was also reduced by half a gear. British gold 125 was 1 shilling 1 pence, and 875 had broken 2 pence. US dollar 25 was 28 yuan 125, Indian exchange 75 was 7 rupees 75, French franc 7 yuan was 718 yuan, German exchange 1 yuan was 118 marks, and ocean half yuan was 70 shields. Ocean plus 1 tael and a half was 200 taels, Hong Kong plus 125 was 80 taels 0625, Japanese gold plus 1 point 75 was 1 tael 7 mace 6 fen. As for the domestic market, it was very strong at first, but later, when the gold market plummeted and suddenly broke through 800 taels, it became loose and excessive. In the afternoon, it was even more sluggish, but not as violent as the gold price. As a result, compared to the previous afternoon, British gold rose 0.1875, US dollar 0.3125, and Japanese gold fell 0.025, showing clear differences between appearance and reality. In the morning, Chinese merchants such as the Dalian gang had some cooperation, and then Yu Feng Yong and others tended to sell, with supply exceeding demand overall. Fuchang Yuanheng, and others had returned notes, with British gold totaling about 400,000 pounds. The banks, such as the Central Bank, sold, which were absorbed by their counterparts. About 200,000 US dollars were thrown out, and the banks also conducted counter-trades. There was also a telegram from Manila selling out. Japanese gold was bought by the Dalian gang for tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The domestic market fluctuated by 0.375 throughout the day. In the morning, the offering price was 1 shilling 2 pence 0.0625, and the buying price was 0.125.

<h3>Money Market Slightly More Lively</h3>
<p>The financial market situation has been in a state of silence for a long time, and there has been no movement to date. Although the demand side yesterday was slightly better than in the past, it did not reach an extremely strong level, so the money market seemed slightly tight. The ocean interest rate was also slightly better than the previous day, but it was unable to take off, probably because of the overall stagnation.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices: (Ocean Interest) The early market interest rate was 0.072 yuan, a premium of 0.00125 yuan, which was 0.0025 yuan better than the previous day's noon market. The noon market was another 0.0025 yuan better, at 0.072 yuan, a premium of 0.00375 yuan. Trading trends were quite active, but banks were inactive. (Silver Interest) Both the early and noon markets did the same 0.0006, which was 0.0001 better than the previous day. The situation was relatively favorable. The addition of water to the account remained no more than 0.0002 or 0.0003.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: There was still no trading of Jiangnan small silver coins, so the market price was also unchanged, estimated at 0.0656 yuan. The early and noon markets were the same. Guangdong small silver coins were 0.06455 yuan in the early market and 0.0646 yuan in the noon market, with trading made. The early market was 135,000 jiao, and the noon market was 100,000 jiao. Copper coins were changed to 1,000 cash to 378,500 cash.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: (Silver Funds) Bank collection and disbursement news remained the same. Chinese merchants collected and disbursed notes for more than 2.5 million yuan, foreign merchants collected and disbursed notes for more than 1.4 million yuan, special funds collected and disbursed more than 1 million yuan, collateral funds more than 800,000 yuan, and various goods, foreign exchange, taxes, and miscellaneous funds collected and disbursed more than 9 million yuan. 600,000 yuan went into the warehouse and 400,000 yuan went out of the warehouse. Japanese banks collected and disbursed various funds for more than 4.3 million yuan, with 500,000 yuan going into the warehouse. Qianzhuang and silver public units collected and disbursed more than 48 million yuan, and account funds collected and disbursed more than 3.8 million yuan. Various remittance funds collected and disbursed more than 1.4 million yuan, and several tens of thousands of yuan were disbursed in cash. (Foreign Funds) Remittance notes made 1.475 million yuan in the early market and 1.57 million yuan in the noon market. Banknotes were 65,000 yuan in the early market and 100,050 yuan in the noon market. Off-site banknotes were 170,000 yuan in the early market and 85,000 yuan in the noon market. Bank trading was 600,000 yuan in the early market and 550,000 yuan in the noon market. The inflow and outflow of foreign accounts among various banks was more than 2.3 million yuan, and the inflow and outflow of banknotes was more than 2 million yuan. Qianzhuang and foreign public units collected and disbursed more than 6.4 million yuan, and foreign account funds collected and disbursed more than 2.5 million yuan. Foreign exchange borrowing and lending was 1.7 million yuan, and small qianzhuang trading was more than 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Qian Industry Market Changes Meeting Time</h3>
<p>The qian industry market has traditionally started its meetings and mutual market trading at 8:30 every morning and 12:30 at noon, as well as setting silver interest rates, foreign interest rates, and other market prices. Now, because the days are long and the nights are short, there is a need to advance the morning meeting time. Therefore, it was decided yesterday by the market committee to start the silver interest rate meeting at 8:00 every morning starting from June 1, half an hour earlier than usual, while the noon market will remain the same.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market: Morning High, Afternoon Low</h3>
<p>The yarn market's morning rise and afternoon fall were entirely affected by the gold market. However, the demand for spot yarn in the market is extremely strong, and all gangs are showing excitement. Guangdong, Yunnan, Tianjin, and other gangs are becoming more interested, so the spot yarn situation is relatively tight. Coarse yarn is also gradually becoming active. However, rumors and speculations were rife in the afternoon. Gold prices plummeted, so the selling pressure was intense, and Ruida sold a large batch of 3,800 bales, overwhelming the market. Therefore, although there was a large volume of actual sales, the market sentiment was still weak, probably because the majority of retail investors had a psychology of selling high and buying low. However, in terms of the overall trend, it is feared that it will still hover around 160 taels.</p>
<p>Man-Made Fiber Slightly Affected: In the man-made fiber front market, the opening was marked by a large merchant absorbing heavily this month, causing nervousness. The price of Grade 3 yarn was firm, with all months up 1 tael and 3 mace, and the distant months up 0.08 or 0.09 taels. In the afternoon, it was heard that gold prices had fallen sharply and a large holder was selling a large number of bales, causing market sentiment to loosen suddenly. All fell 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, or 0.04 taels. The volume was 31,800 bales. It was found that Ruida sold 3,800 bales, Taixing 1,050 bales, Dachang 1,150 bales, and Lichang 1,700 bales. Gongtai bought 950 bales, Tongyu 900 bales, Gengfeng 2,550 bales, Tongxing 1,050 bales, Yichang 900 bales, and Changfeng 900 bales. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>Man-Made Fiber Closing Prices: Increase/Decrease Balance Number: August 160.6 -0.05 846,000</p>
<p>June 160.3 -0.01 620,500 September 157.6 458,700</p>
<p>July 160.7 478,100 October 157.7 441,500</p>
<p>Customer Sales 4,700 Bales: Spot Yarn Sales Relatively Smooth: Statistics show that all gangs bought a total of 4,700 bales for the whole day, and fellow traders entered 1,570 bales. The market is strong. Among the customer gangs, Guangdong entered 920 bales, Sichuan entered 500 bales, Tianjin entered 500 bales, the interior entered 355 bales, Shantou entered 440 bales, Xuzhou entered 150 bales, Shandong entered 340 bales, Changsha entered 330 bales, Hankou entered 50 bales, Yunnan entered 460 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 300 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market: Stable Start, Weak Finish</h3>
<p>The cotton market started firm and then fell. However, overseas cotton markets remained weak and exchange rates continued to shrink. However, gold prices fell sharply in the afternoon, and people had no confidence, so the market tended to decline, and the situation softened again. However, the underlying goods were scarce, and Japanese merchants purchased a large batch of October futures, about 30,000 dan, and this kind of action cannot be ignored. The current situation is completely uncertain.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Slightly Lower: In the man-made fiber front market, the opening was marked by firm gold prices and relatively high prices, with all rising 0.01 or 0.02 taels. In the afternoon, it was heard that gold prices had fallen sharply, and the market became weak again, with all falling 0.02, 0.03, or 0.04 taels. The volume was 42,800 dan. It was found that Changfeng sold 4,300 dan, Lichang 4,900 dan, and Yongfeng 2,100 dan. Shenchang bought 2,300 dan, Gongtai 1,100 dan, and Gengfeng 3,700 dan.

<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Show Mixed Price Movements</h3>
<p>US cotton remains stagnant. Yesterday, US cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but weakened due to weakness on Wall Street. It then firmed again due to some short covering. Futures fell 0.03 to 0.08 pounds, and spot remained unchanged. UK cotton futures rose 6-7 points, and spot rose 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot rose 5 points. Indian cotton firmed due to broker purchases and good news from Liverpool, with Pingguoer unchanged and Uma rising 2 rupees, Bailuo Creek rising 1 rupee.

<h3>Grain: Some Hakka Merchants Experiment with Indicia Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hakka indicia rice market situation remained dull. Local merchants were no longer paying attention to Hakka indicia rice because goods had arrived from downstream, so the overall market had no transactions. However, the Dalian gang suddenly experimented with 100 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, which was of upper-middle quality and priced at 11 yuan and 0.35 yuan. If the experiment was successful, they would continue to purchase. The Xiamen gang also purchased 210 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled Yuan rice, priced at 12.5 yuan to 12.25 yuan. There were no other transactions. Because some Hakka merchants were experimenting, the market situation was relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Starch: Market Shifts from Active to Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month tended to be more active. Although foreign wheat was reported to be about 0.04-0.05 yuan lower, because the weather was foggy and sultry, there was concern about rain, so the near and distant months were all firm. The closing price was about 0.01 yuan better compared to the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was extremely cold. Because the weather was clear, there was a long period of sunshine, or the new wheat harvest period could pass smoothly, so most minds returned to a loose state, slightly flatter than in the morning. However, after the gold market plummeted, it was feared that the subsequent situation would also drive the market. As a result, this month was 0.01 yuan better than the previous day, July was 0.0075 yuan better, September was 0.005 yuan better, and October was 0.0075 yuan better.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures: Market Shows Promising Signs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, because the weather was not rainy but generally hot and sultry, most speculative bulls thought that rain would fall, and they shouted prices and absorbed, so the distant months were 0.03, 0.04, or 0.05 yuan higher than the previous day. This situation was completely dependent on the weather for transfer. In the afternoon, each market was calmer due to the weather turning cooler and the flour market also stopping. Each market's opening price also tended to hover. As for the new wheat harvest prospects this year, because the winter was very cold, the land was affected, so the current hope is that if the harvest is smooth, then people's minds will not be too high, because the factories' foreign wheat is still enough for 2-3 months. As a result, June was 0.04 yuan higher than the previous day, July was 0.04 yuan higher, August was 0.03 yuan higher, September was 0.02 yuan higher, and October was 0.03 yuan higher.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Transactions Quite Smooth</h3>
<p>Mixed Rises and Falls</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegram stated that Cuban spot sugar prices remained unchanged. New York sugar futures for September continued to fall by 0.03 compared to the previous telegram, December also fell by 0.02, and March of next year fell by 0.01. Java spot sugar remained unchanged. Outside of the association's market, the decline in foreign exchange made buying even quieter, but the number of sellers was very small, and the market could still stabilize. The transaction price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was still 11.2 yuan, No. 20 medium sand white 10.065 yuan, high goods 10.07 yuan, No. 10 Dutch red 9.7 yuan, and No. 9 was 9.45 to 9.5 yuan. The market situation was generally stable. Japanese sugar transactions also had little rise or fall. The N price was still 11.2 yuan, the YP was 11.5 yuan, and the SH was 10.0925 yuan, unchanged from before. The YT was 11.1125 yuan, a fall of 0.025. Minghua YRO was 10.0725 yuan, a rise of 0.025. Meiji YRO was 10.065 yuan. Transactions were more active, and the market image was firm, but sales were not smooth enough.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Jinhua and Lanxi Cocoon Shops Stop Weighing</h3>
<p>Cocoon production is generally less than 30%. The average cocoon price is 46 yuan. The cocoon market in Jinhua and Lanxi, Zhejiang province, had the worst new cocoon harvest this year, with less than 30% general harvest. Only four or five cocoon shops were weighing. In the week since the weighing began, each shop's collection was only 20% of last year's. The cocoons were of poor quality, with the highest price being 51 yuan, the lowest 40 yuan, and the average 46 yuan. All cocoon shops have stopped weighing and are separately shipping new cocoons.</p>
<h3>Black and Green Tea Trends Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port with foreign firms had a total of more than 2,000 boxes of Keemun and other kinds of black tea sold. Although Jardine Matheson's willingness to buy was slightly weaker than before, most firms were still buying, and the market could still stabilize. It was found that more than 40,000 boxes of Keemun black tea have arrived, and more than 30,000 boxes have been sold since the market opened. The overall trend has been stable. The green tea market also had no major changes. The sales of Suian Zhenmei to the UK continued to be smooth, and the price was still firm. However, there were not many arrivals, and transactions were not active. Because the supply of earth-produced Zhenmei was also scarce, the market situation was bleak.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Spring Dried Cocoons Gradually Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>New cocoons in Linping, Gongchen Bridge, Genshanmen, and Changan Xiashi in Hangzhou have been listed, and cocoon shops have been weighing for many days. Because silk merchants have learned that this year's cocoon production is very low and the quality of cocoons is generally poor, they are actively drying the fresh cocoons they have collected into dried cocoons and shipping them to Shanghai for trial reeling to see the size of the reeling yield. Therefore, the Huitong Transfer Company has shipped batches of sample cocoons from various silk factories, totaling more than 1,000 packages, to Shanghai, where they are now being tested in factories. During the middle of this week, a large batch of dried cocoons from various provinces will be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Xucun High-Quality Cocoons: Short Supply, Rising Prices</h3>
<p>Improved Variety of High-Quality Cocoons Already Opened at 57-58 Yuan</p>
<p>This year, the overall cocoon production in the Xucun area of Changan is only 30%. The cocoon quality is generally poor, and there are more inferior cocoons. In the week since the cocoon shops opened, the collection of high-quality cocoons has been sluggish. After several days of cloudy and rainy weather, there were not many arrivals in the market. The weather has cleared in the past two days, and more cocoons have gradually arrived. Each shop is competing to collect the best ones, and the cocoon price is gradually rising. The price of high-quality improved varieties opened at 57-58 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Summer Clothing and Woolen Fabrics Sell Well in Hot Weather</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather in this port suddenly became hot, and woolen summer clothing sold well. Both Western clothing shops and door shops had demand. Feathers yarn, flannels, white broadcloth, white Zhigong, Pangbiequ, Balene yarn, twill rubber cloth, and yellow twill, etc., all had zero-length transactions in the morning and afternoon, and trading was increasingly prosperous. Only velvet sales remained dull, probably because the price has reached a new record of 3.2 yuan, and buyers are generally dissatisfied, so they have switched to buying other woolen goods.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Market Prices Driven Up by Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>The market price of woolen fabrics has been rising recently. The main reason is that most of them have been driven up by exchange rates. According to the exchange rate, the price of importing woolen goods has increased, and sellers' minds have become firm. Yesterday, the selling price of popular woolen goods such as single-sided open water and autumn products increased by several percent to one yuan, and the trend was all firm.</p>
<h3>Wujin: Weisitie Sales Strong, Prices High</h3>
<p>Weisitie market has made good progress recently, so Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, the Yangtze gang, and the Guangdong gang all have some transactions, and manufacturers' buying and selling in this street are also quite smooth. It was found that a total of 700-800 boxes have been traded in the past two days. The price is estimated at 34 yuan per box, which is 0.025 yuan higher than before. Although recent arrivals have been abundant, because the outflow is smooth, the price is still strong. According to insiders, the arrival of this batch of goods is very rare, so people's minds are good, so the market trend is very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Huayuan Lead Wire: Someone Buys and Hoards</h3>
<p>The overseas arrivals of Huayuan lead wire have been very rare recently, and the cost is very high, so there are very few orders for later batches. However, actual buying and selling are extremely quiet, so the price has no vitality. However, because some wealthy firms have seen the current situation and are buying and hoarding, the trading aspect is quite optimistic. The price is estimated at 4.</p>
<h3>Kinué Hitomi and the Marriage Question</h3>
<p>— Fu Lan</p>
<p>Speaking of the name of the Japanese Miss Kinué Hitomi, it is truly like thunder in the ears; the whole world knows it. Unexpectedly, yesterday, Reuters in Tokyo reported that she is suffering from severe meningitis. Even if she recovers, she may be forced to no longer actively participate in sports because her weak health cannot cope. This news will surely attract public attention and regret.</p>
<p>However, Miss Hitomi currently has a more personal and lifelong matter that has not been resolved, which may be reducing her interest in sports. She is already twenty-five years old this year. At this age for women in Japan, if they have not yet obtained a husband, they will begin to feel anxiety. Miss Hitomi herself has truthfully acknowledged this situation in an article published in Osaka in the "New Society for Women, May Issue."</p>
<p>In this article, Miss Hitomi says that it is not just the fact that she is twenty-five that makes her anxious. What she dislikes most is that curious friends often ask her questions, which annoys her. She says, "People often ask me when I plan to get married. My answer is 'I don't know.' Maybe I will never get married, although I want to reserve this thought. Because once I become a real old maid, or if I change my mind, some people will surely remember what I said now and secretly laugh at me."</p>
<p>In the past, the main questions Miss Hitomi's friends and admirers asked her whenever they met were, "Do you exercise every day?" and "What record do you plan to break at the next World Games?" But recently, these questions have been abandoned, replaced by "Are you still exercising?" and "But, of course, you must be thinking about getting married, right?"</p>
<p>In this article, Miss Hitomi also said, "Senior colleagues often advise me to start considering marriage, but I often honestly ask myself if my nature is suitable for marriage. Marriage is asking for trouble because it can sometimes make people stupid and rob them of their enterprising spirit. I don't want to consider this kind of marriage. It's just that people often bring up the question to advise me, and some even ridicule me, saying that I am a famous athlete who, when she gets angry, will take it out on her husband and beat him. But I never think of doing such a thing because my heart is not cruel. As for the fierce look on my face when I race, that is irrelevant."</p>
<p>"So, putting aside the thought of marriage, I want to find something I can do. If I devote the time I spend considering marriage to my work, of course, I can achieve great things."</p>
<p>Miss Kinué Hitomi has been to Europe three times to attend competitions and has won many international women's championships. Among the most famous are the 200 meters (24.7 seconds) in 1929 and the 400 meters (59 seconds) in 1928, both of which were women's records she created.</p>
<h3>Marshal Foch's World War Diary</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>An examination of the temporary setbacks of the German attack and the situation created by the reinforcement of the Allied forces south of the Somme River, as well as the conclusions drawn from relevant enemy intelligence, are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The enemy, who is blocked between the Scarpe River and Arras, may be able to launch another attack. His re-attack will be difficult south of the Somme River, but easier to start north of the Somme River. Therefore, a particularly strong line of defense should be set up between the Somme River and Arras. This is the work undertaken by the British General Headquarters. The French reserve forces gathered in the Beauvais area should be able to move to the north of the Somme River to fight. The procedures for transporting troops must be arranged in advance. This is the problem of the French General Headquarters.</p>
<p>(2) Regardless of the German strategy, our army should quickly preemptively strike south of the Somme River in order to drive the enemy away from the Paris-Amiens railway and the center of the Amiens railway, because these two places are extremely important for our army's transportation and supply. According to this policy, the military law aims to drive the enemy to Roye. An offensive should be launched immediately in the Montdidier area. The British army aims to relieve the danger of Amiens and should attack simultaneously on both sides of the Somme River.</p>
<p>From then on, the Allied forces switched to the offensive. The completely passive attitude since March 21 and the solid defense work forced by the situation came to an end, replaced by an active offensive.</p>
<p>Now, planning the offensive battle, encouraging the soldiers, directing the battle, urging the two general commands to coordinate everything, and allocating forces, the power given to me by the Doullens Agreement is clearly insufficient. Even in directing the current offensive battle, I feel stretched. Soon, the American army will join the war, and my responsibility is to arrange the coordination of the Allied forces. According to the situation, the evaluation criteria for each army's attack, the allocation of offensive and defensive work, and the alternation of French and Italian troops at the front will be determined. My authority will definitely feel even more constrained.</p>
<p>The simple task of the coordinator is not enough for the larger plans that are about to be carried out. If he wants to react quickly and forcefully to unexpected events in the defensive war or launch a large-scale offensive, he has little room to maneuver. His task should be changed to that of commander. If the Doullens Conference created this Allied mechanism out of trust, its power should be immediately expanded and entrusted with full authority to command the Western Front war, acknowledging that its authority is higher than that of the Allied general commands. The front-line troops from the North Sea to the Adriatic Sea must be completely under its control.</p>
<p>A few days of experience have been enough to expose the shortcomings of the Doullens Agreement. The current and future interests of the Allied forces urgently require the revision of this agreement. I, therefore, raised this issue to the French Prime Minister based on this intention and requested that the decisions of the British and French governments regarding me on March 26 be supplemented. Clemenceau discussed this matter with me on April 1 and decided to convene another new meeting. He then invited representatives from the United States, Britain, and France to attend this meeting. Two days later, on April 3, a resolution was passed at the Beauvais City Hall as follows:</p>
<p>"The British, French, and American governments entrust General Foch with the task of coordinating the Western Front Allied forces and grant him full authority to command the war." (To be continued)</p>
