<p>自由談付之一笑海客　　少　丨小弟弟一你姊　今天出來麼。　　童子丨伊今天家裏有事。不出來了。少年丨上禮拜我送了伊一個戒指。伊歡喜麼。　　童子丨伊嫌你那個戒指太小了。因爲別的男朋友來瞧友來伊時。伊脫下來也來不及。　　美國人丨今天我要買一個花圈其友（作詫異色）咦。爲甚麼買花圈。明天不是你結婚的吉日麼。美國人丨是的。所以我今天要買一個花圈。去獻與自由神像。因爲我的自由。已壽終正寢了。　　母(敎訓其八歲之子）丨孩子。今夜你的父親的一位好朋友要來吃夜飯。你須得規規矩矩的。不可胡說亂道。　　兒丨我知道。　　母丨你倘胡說亂道。客人要生氣的。　　兒丨我知道（此時客人來了。母親招待他坐下。兒立在一旁。眼睜睜地對着客人那個又大又紅的鼻子呆瞧。　　母丨孩子。你過來。怎麼不呌一聲伯伯。　　兒丨我正在這裏想伯伯的鼻子。怎麼又大又紅。像一個橘子一樣。廣州市之新建築杜少梅　　客有自五羊來者。余就問詢南來事。道及故鄉之新建築。茲錄於下。　　觀音山之盛况觀音山即粵秀山。環山皆路也文通便利。莫之與京。風景之美。久傳人口。今已闢爲公園。築中山紀念碑於其上。中空有梯可直登其巔。爲巿中之最高者。俯覽全城。萬象森列。千載之閟。一旦軒露。山麓有總理紀念堂。相峙上下。足以見和粵人崇拜總理之眞誠也。又有仲元圖書館。建築美觀。搜羅豐富。又有素負古蹟勝名之五層樓者。今已改爲博物院矣。聞荔枝灣又將闢爲公園。地日落成。一山一水。亦足以互相媲美也。　　河北馬路之改革廣州之馬路分三期建築。第一期先築重要街道之在繁盛區域者。第二期築交通便利者。第三期然後築其餘各街巷今第一期已告竣。第二期着手進行第三期想亦不遠矣。其中尤以永漢路爲最佳。與海上之靜安寺路可以並駕齊驅。餘若長堤大爲路與西關十七八甫上下九甫等處。亦何多讓哉。余歸故鄉時。尚在垂髫。猶能憶街道之崎嶇一別十年聞之不禁有滄桑之慨焉。　　河南之發達情形河南者。廣州市之南部也。地勢爲一三角洲。商業亦頗發達。惟街道尚欠整齊丶聞省政府將設合署於河南丶故修築各街道以利文通。現已開築成功者。有南岸大馬路。曩昔繁盛之區也丶又有沿河二馬路。惟沿河大馬路尚待經濟寬裕。然後建築。今又有驚人之大建築者。厥惟橫貫南北兩岸之活動鐵橋。在全市之中心點。計劃中有橋三道。今困於經濟。先築其一。明夏可以完工。旣通之後。河南商業。定能勝於河北。綜觀國內諸大商埠。有鐵橋之能跨兩岸者。惟廣州耳。說者謂我國市政之發達。首推廣州。良有以也。鱸魚食譜楊一笑　　鱸鱠以松江鱸魚。熟而切之爲鱠。肉白如雪。無腥。所謂金　玉鱠。東南之嘉味也。　　鱸羹以松江鱸魚。切成簿片。置於鍋內。再加火腿。鷄湯。食鹽少許。燒五分鐘便熟。味美而肉緊。　　鱸肺以松江四鰓鱸數尾。剖腹取肺。用冬笋雪裏紅。加鷄湯少許。在文火上燉之。其味鮮而且嫩。天誅地滅　陳叔平　　天誅地滅。係詈人不得善終之意。不料日前盛傳水西門外有一男子遭此慘禍。予奇其言。即請敎於鄰叟。叟固廣見博學之士。據云。此乃一種陰症。與人面瘡同丶患者必曾造惡多端。倖逃法網。遂致食此冥報。蓋一染此疾。須備嘗諸般痛苦。然後肉體腐爛。日就贏縮。馴　化爲烏有。予爲好奇心所激使。於星期清晨。偕文友張君同往一覘其異。迤邐出西門。輾轉問詢。卒達目的地。據其鄉農云。患者係一乞丐。宿於破廟簷下。遵其指引。始見一乞丐坐階上。年約不惑。正依墻曝日。暼見予等至。如受電擊。驚駭欲遁且大呼來人鐵近丶予亟止之。並貽以袁頭一枚。因得詳加審視。但見丐者全身滿佈小孔。孔中有蛆丶蠕蠕而動。形如米蟲。惟色黑略扁。據云一見生人。蛆即鑽入肌膚。頓覺癢不可耐。少頃。繼之以奇痛。如受針刺。得症之由丶頗爲奇特。數年前夏夜裸臥丶夢一老人以芝蔴斗許向之猛撒。着身盡變爲蝨。鑽入膚中。醒來遂呈此怪狀。一載後。孔中漸有黃色液汁外潘。體日憔瘦身之高度已短縮數寸矣。目下祗求速死。俾得早離苦海云云。予等聆言。惻焉憫之。歸途因兩腿麻。遂趨道旁小茶肆稍憩。予等談及此事。乃爲茶博士所聞丶遽　言曰。丐者王姓。略愔拳術。少壯時。固虎而冠者也。好遊蕩不事生產光復後。專充士匪之響導。因之富室及仇家被害者。指不勝屈。今得此報。宜也。又何憐惜爲。合座聞語。爲之感嘆。予因目睹之事丶非傳聞可比。故記其梗概如右。以告當世之不信果報者。中國古時之按摩松廬　　昨讀秋水君之按摩考一文。記述按摩之源流綦詳。文中復有註云。按摩之術。中國稱之曰推拿。玩其語氣。似以按摩之名頗新。或竟疑爲採擇自西洋者。實則按摩之術。在中國源流已古。試舉聊齋志梅女篇中之一段。以當參考。﹁······妾解按摩之術。願盡技能。以侑清夢。封從其請。女疊掌爲之輕按。自項及踵皆編。手所經。骨若醉。既而握指細擂。如以團絮相觸狀。體舒暢不可言。擂至腰。口目皆慵。至股則沉沉睡去矣。及醒。日已向午。骨節清和。殊於往日。·······﹂　　以上數言。蓋不啻將按摩之術。描寫得淋漓盡致矣。按聊齋志爲蒲留仙氏所作。蒲爲清初人。則所紀猶未足以云古。茲更當參閱書中呂湛恩之註解兩則。　　一周禮。天官疾。醫以五味五穀五藥養其病。疏。劉向扁鵲治趙太子尸蹶之病使子明炊湯。子儀脈神。子術按摩。﹂　　﹁又唐書百官志。太醫者。掌百醫療之法其屬有四。一曰醫師。二曰鍼師。三曰按摩師。四曰咒禁師。﹂觀此。可知按摩之名。在我國相傳實古。周時已有之。而隋唐時代。更列入太醫得享皇俸。惜以其道不傳。今之所謂按摩者。率皆有其名而無其實矣。志杏芬老人之赴告清　　　唐子吉生爲余二十餘年前之及門。嘗館於其家丶其先德昆華。甫罷官江寗。余爲刊﹁曾管領六朝山水﹂小印。而吉生髫年時。亦復英詞卓榮。知爲偉器。厥後余爲衣食所累。雖槖筆滬上。而音問久疎。昨自郵得其高堂杏芬太夫人之赴告。驚悉於客歲僊遊篷島。不覺爲之愴懷。老人本字淑娟。爲名畫家吳子嘉先生女。故工六法丶今展閱其家傳下。有老人之遺墨。均用珂羅版影印。設色者則仿吳道子佛象。仿惲南田沒骨法之荷花。仿仇十洲工筆樓閣之秋院宴樂圖。及仕女宜男多子圖。仿沈南蘋雙鈎花鳥之玉堂富貴。補銅器拓本之歲朝圖。及石溪山水之扇面。墨筆則有仿鄭板橋之蘭竹。與仿馬遠雪景之山居圖。楷書有後赤壁賦。與長軸﹁八面現金容。一出人間消刦運。十方沾水滴。大家身上發慈悲﹂之長聯。皆老人之精品也丶吉生雖履嚴霜而怵惕。感零露以凄其。而其母氏之筆毛墨瀋。不忍其堙沒不傳。擇其尤者。以之入銅。而貽戚黨朋好之覽觀。所謂孝思不匱者非歟。暇當傳其軼事。揚扢一二。并以慰唐子之哀思焉。　　出版界消息大東書局劉公豁君主編之﹁戲劇月刊﹂。精神飽滿。遐邇馳名。前出梅蘭芳。尚小雲。程艷秋。王少樓等專號。尤爲各界所稱道。迺者武生泰斗楊小樓來滬。劉君復擬出一﹁楊小樓號﹂。良以楊氏劇藝。超越　倫。不特一字一腔。胥有來歷。即一舉手一投足。亦是爲後學典型也。劉君昨己發出徵稿函多封。據云在半月內。有以關於楊氏之文稿見寄。每千字當酌酬一羊至五云。巴黎物語（十）六曾寄於巴黎　　最近巴黎的幾齣新戲　　電影已經說夠了。現在再談談巴黎最近上演的幾齣新戲罷。凡是到過法國的。想都知道法國的暑假放得很長罷。中小學生要十月一日才關進學校。大學生要十一月初才有課聽。並且法國的暑假非常普及。不單學生歇暑。凡住在城巿的人。無論屬於那項職業。一到夏天總要往鄉下或海濱去休息些時。因此在暑假期內的巴黎是比較蕭條的。尤其是那幾十家劇院。夏日天氣熱。除掉一班在巴黎怱怱經過的遊客外。眞正的巴黎巿民誰還肯在這時期跑到悶熱得像蒸籠似的劇院去受罪呢。所以巴黎各劇院夏天生意很清淡。多半休演。等到天氣越冷下去便越好。其最熱閙的時候是冬季。普通常呌冬季做﹁戲劇時節﹂就因爲冬天最宜於看戲的緣故。從十月起。巴黎冬劇院都大槪從新裝修了。都有新編的戲劇上演。這時街頭貼着的戲目和報上登着的劇評都熱閙到萬分。雖是對於戲劇沒有多少興趣的人。也常是禁不住要受着誘惑去見識一下。　　但看戲比看電影貴多了。稍好的座位總得三四十佛郎。最便宜的在四層或第五層的座位也得五六個佛郎。這種五六個佛郎的座位因爲高高在上的緣故。普通呌作﹁天國﹂Ｐａｒａｄｉｓｏ在下今年受着銀跌的影響。有時想聽聽戲。便只好登上天國去聽。茲將最近從天國聽來的兩齣新申戲介紹如下。心上溫馨（三五四）包天笑　　第十七回駐顏有術翠黛蛾眉　續命無方黃金市駿骨　　有人說。。老林黛玉別的倒沒有什麼。。就是有些口氣。。大槪伊自己也有些覺得。。所以身邊常帶一雙豆宼盒。。以爲嚼了豆宼。。可以免除口臭。。任佩眞却不過伊的意思。。也就噙了一粒。。有了這一位工應酬善詞令的花國元老在座。。自然談笑風生。。愈加熱閙了。。那時在座的人。。看了老林黛玉的樣子。。暗暗想名下非虛。。凌趾祥和伊很熟。。因爲伊的應酬多。。在檯面上常常遇到伊。而且都是那班達官貴人呌伊的。。因想這眞是一個怪物。。怎麼半百年紀的人。。不覺得老的。。心裏那樣想。。眼睛便不禁注視了伊。。看得老林黛玉有點不好意思。。便道。。凌大少。。你看我這兩天面孔交關難看嗎。。實在身體一徑弗大好呀。。凌趾祥道。。不是的。。人家說你年紀不過二十多歲。。我知道你不止二十多歲了。。但是看上去。。正不過二十三四歲。。你到底用什麼方法。。可以使得這樣的年輕。。可以把那個神秘之法。。傳授給我們嗎。。老林黛玉道。。說我廿幾歲。。那是要紅馬桶裏重新去翻一個筋斗哉。。實實在在我今年是三十九歲。開年四十歲。。做一個小生日。。還要請你們各位賞光吃麵咧。。龍紫耘道。。三十九歲的人。。眞看不出。。有人說。。女人們要容顏不哀老。。每天服珠粉若干。。你也服過珠紛嗎。。老林黛玉道。。這也不過說說罷了。。那珠子是貴重之品。。那裏有這許多珠紛給人家吃呢。。况且這是要常吃了。。還有一點效騐。。我們堂子裏人。。那裏吃得起呢。。孫企雷道。。這是你太客氣了。。便是珠粉。。每日也不過幾釐。。到成有限。。美林黛玉道。。孫四少倒說得好笑。。就是每天幾釐。。一個月要多少。。一年又要多少。。我們要吃得起。。也不至於到堂子裏來了。。任佩眞道。。你們這班在堂子裏的人。。眞是寫意。。討論到吃珠粉問題。。你們到北方災荒之區去看看。。連麥紛都沒有得吃。。只好吃糠栖。。有的連糕粞也沒有。。沙土也可充飢。。所以天下事是不平等的。。老林黛玉恐怕伊又說出什麼駡人的話。。便連忙接看說道。。眞的。。我們南邊人是頂頂有福氣的人。。古語說的上有天堂。。下有蘇杭。。蘇杭已經是天堂。。現在的上海。。可以算得天堂中的天堂。。你們試到北方去看看。。簡直是苦不勝言。。我從前也到過北方好幾次。。所以我也知道一些北方的情形。。</p>

He is scheduled to return to Wuhan in a few days and will convene a conference of responsible officers from the anti-bandit forces in the three provinces, or chiefs of staff from various armies, divisions, and brigades, to discuss new strategies. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: In recent days, Chiang Kai-shek has been summoning He Chengjun, Wang Jinyu, and others to inquire about the situation of the Communists in the three provinces and discuss strategies for their suppression. Due to the encirclement and suppression by the Central Army, the main forces of the Communists have mostly broken up into smaller units. When the main army arrives, they transform into villagers, and when the army leaves, they take up arms as bandits again. Moreover, they are familiar with the terrain and often use scholars as guides, making it difficult to completely eradicate them, which is particularly detrimental. The main points of the future suppression strategy are: (1) Gather refugees; (2) Implement collective responsibility; (3) Support the people's self-defense forces; and (4) Implement a progressive approach.

<h3>Negotiations for Jin Army Reorganization Loan Remain Deadlocked</h3>

<p>Tianjin: According to a banker, Jing Youyan, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, contacted the banking community twice for funds for the reorganization of the Jin army, proposing to borrow 2 million yuan.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary: Recent Trends in the European Federation</p>
<p>The world often considers the issue of arms reduction to be one of the most dangerous issues of 1931, and the issue of the European Federation is a prerequisite for the success of arms reduction. The most difficult compromise in arms reduction is the negotiation between France and Italy. The European Federation Committee has just convened, and France and Italy are already at odds over the issue of Russia's participation. After the meeting passed a compromise, the Italian Foreign Minister still dissented and argued fiercely with Briand. The discord between France and Italy is becoming increasingly apparent. The committee intends to temporarily shelve this issue and focus on resolving the economic crisis. All non-member states in Europe and member states outside of Europe can be invited to participate, which is the most urgent issue at present. However, given the complex nature of solving the economic crisis, there are many differences of opinion. Even if all countries sincerely cooperate, it is still uncertain whether there will be a satisfactory result. Moreover, there are already political prejudices hindering the process, making it even more difficult to expect good results. Furthermore, the German proposal to abolish the Young Plan and revise the peace treaty involves the relationship between France and Italy. In addition to Germany, other countries are also involved due to their own interests, creating relationships between France and Italy. Therefore, although only France and Italy are currently opposed to each other, in the future, each will help their own interests and reject those that harm them, so the so-called opposition is not only between France and Italy, but also the formation of two major alliance forces among European countries, as rumored recently. Today, under this difficult economic situation in the world, the division among European countries makes the future difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

<p>League of Nations Administrative Council Begins Discussing Arms Reduction</p>
<p>The Dispute Between Germany and Poland is One of the Key Cases</p>
<p>It Will Affect the Revision of the Peace Treaty</p>
<p>The True Face of the European Federation is Exposed</p>
<p>A Heated Debate Erupts Over the Issue of Russian and Turkish Participation</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 20th - The League of Nations Administrative Council held an open meeting today. Chairman and British Prime Minister Henderson strongly advocated for courage in discussing the issue of arms reduction, stating that all members of the League of Nations should dismiss talks of a war crisis and do everything within their power to show the world that they are all opposed to war, and that they should also oppose the atmosphere that can promote war, gradually preparing to oppose war preparations. He also said that an effective plan to reduce armaments is a necessary condition for seeking the future happiness of all nations in the world. German Foreign Minister Curtius then declared that although the German representative in the Arms Reduction Preparatory Committee's report did not agree on several key points, it was an important step towards approaching arms reduction. The path to holding a major arms reduction conference is now at least open. Italian Foreign Minister Grandi agreed with the German Foreign Minister's remarks. French Foreign Minister Briand expressed sympathy with the views expressed by the British Foreign Minister, saying that he believes the point has now been reached where the arms reduction conference can be expected to succeed. Today, material issues have been overshadowed by the spirit of all countries, with priorities clearly defined. Although the general public advocates that the cause of peace has not progressed, armaments have been reduced and not increased.</p>
<p>National Society, Geneva, 19th - At the first meeting of the 62nd League of Nations Administrative Council today, 14 of the 35 items on the agenda were discussed. However, the main issues have not yet been discussed. Chairman White and British Foreign Minister Henderson proposed abolishing the custom of reading lengthy reports and instead reading the conclusions, recommendations, or motions within the report, which led to rapid progress. The dates of the three major international conferences have now been agreed upon: the conference on reducing the manufacture of toxic substances will open on May 27th, the rural health conference will open on June 29th, and the international transportation conference will open on October 26th. In addition, among the smaller issues, such as Sir Slade and Director Hans being employed to go to China to serve as advisors to the Chinese government, has also been passed. The League of Nations is approved to allocate 100,000 francs to cover travel expenses. Slade will probably not be able to reach China until after March, while Hans may arrive in China within February. It is said that Mr. Fowler, a financial advisor to the League of Nations, has also been invited by the Chinese government. It is also rumored that Slade may not return to his original position in the future, as his original Financial and Economic Division has now been divided into two divisions, with Briton Ralph appointed as Director of Finance and Italian Stubani appointed as Director of the Economic Division. The Administrative Council will discuss tomorrow the arms reduction conference being held on March 1st next year, advocating for it to be held this autumn, at the latest no later than the end of the year. As for the issue of the future chairman, it is rumored that Britain and France have agreed to elect the Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia, but Germany also advocates for the election of a foreign minister from an absolutely neutral country such as the Netherlands or Sweden because the Czech Republic is pro-French. It is said that today the German Foreign Minister exchanged views with the French, Italian, and British Foreign Ministers on these two issues, but without any results.</p>
<p>Geneva News - The League of Nations Executive Council meeting was convened on the 19th. The content of this meeting is very important, and it is expected that there will be fierce debate. The issue of ethnic minorities in Upper Silesia is one of the major items on the agenda of this conference. Germany is taking an extremely firm stance on this issue due to internal political reasons. When the case is raised, there will inevitably be a heated debate between German Foreign Minister Curtius and Polish Foreign Minister Charleski. The issue of revising the Treaty of Versailles is related to the dispute between Germany and Poland, so the dispute between Germany and Poland will soon become a dispute between the German and French factions. The timing and location of the arms reduction conference will also be decided at this conference. (World)</p>
<p>National Society, Geneva, 19th - The Committee for Considering the European Federation has temporarily reached a compromise on the issue of inviting Russia, and a definitive decision will be made at a later date. Today, the shareholder committee organized by the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, etc. debated for three hours and almost broke down. Only a compromise was passed by a vote of five to one, declaring that the committee would now focus on resolving the economic crisis. All non-member states in Europe and member states outside of Europe can be invited to participate in jointly resolving economic issues. However, the Italian Foreign Minister still dissented and insisted on unconditionally inviting Russia, and questioned Briand as to whether Russia would be invited under this compromise. Briand's response was evasive. When the six shareholders were arguing, the other committee members waited anxiously outside, as the fate of the entire meeting would depend on it. Finally, Briand came out and announced the results obtained by the shareholder committee, saying that this resolution was not suitable for public discussion, so it was postponed to be decided at the general meeting tomorrow, at which time there will be another round of debate. However, it is expected that the shareholder committee will ultimately adopt this method. The only concern is that Russia may refuse to accept a conditional invitation and may not attend. It is also said that the committee has agreed to also invite Ireland to participate in economic discussions. However, at the general meeting tomorrow, due to the British Foreign Minister's proposal, the above compromise will still be discussed publicly.</p>
<p>National Society, Geneva, 19th - The French delegation here is still strongly opposed to inviting Russia to participate in the European Consideration Committee. The Italian and German delegations support inviting the two countries, as well as Ireland. The Italian side also stated that the compromise agreed upon by the shareholder committee today is equivalent to acknowledging Russia as a member of the committee, as once the discussion shifts from the economic to the political aspect, it will be difficult to exclude the two countries from the discussion.</p>
<p>National Society, Moscow, 19th - The Soviet Russian government's official newspaper commented on the European Consideration Committee in Geneva, claiming that if the agenda, methods, and rules of the meeting have not been discussed in advance, it has already been decided that no self-respecting country would be willing to participate in such a meeting. From these few words, it can be seen that even if invited, Russia will refuse to attend.</p>
<p>End of Indian Round Table Conference</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Promises India Dominion Status</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - The Indian Round Table Conference concluded today. British Prime Minister MacDonald reported on the work of the past ten weeks, stating that the government will immediately and carefully study the work of the various shareholder committees and address various difficult issues, and reiterated his promise to grant India dominion status, stating that India will achieve full autonomy. Upon hearing this, the crowd cheered greatly. Several Indian representatives spoke, expressing gratitude for the assistance, guidance, and encouragement of the British Prime Minister, British Cabinet members, and the Conservative and Liberal parties. The British Prime Minister thanked them and said that there were still many things to be done in the future, and he hoped that all representatives would work together to promote progress. The British Prime Minister then read the British Emperor's instruction, and then announced an indefinite adjournment. The representatives then shouted "Long live the British Emperor, Prime Minister, Justice Minister, and Minister of Indian Affairs" three times and dispersed. The conference passed a motion this morning, believing that the reports of the various shareholder committees provide extremely valuable materials for drafting the Indian constitution. The work that the conference has already done must be continued in order to avoid interruption. The constitution should have provisions to fully protect minority ethnic groups such as Muslims.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - The British Emperor's instruction issued at the closing of the Indian Round Table Conference stated that there will still be a lot of patience, consideration, and careful work in the future, but those who attended the conference have now opened a new page in Indian history.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - The final report of the Indian Round Table Conference's Minority Ethnic Committee advocates that the conference must record any opinions for which everyone agrees to the proposed consultation, and that representatives from all sides must continue negotiations and report the results of their efforts to those who will continue the next round of negotiations. The report also stated that minorities and oppressed classes solemnly declare that if their demands are not properly met, they cannot endorse any autonomous constitution.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - The Indian Round Table Conference held a plenary meeting this morning. British Prime Minister MacDonald, due to the short amount of time, asked the twenty representatives originally scheduled to speak this morning to stop speaking. Many people present reluctantly agreed to his request. Prince Paura said that the Indian princes can only unite with an autonomous British India. Indian female representative Subbarayan said that if India is to occupy its proper place in the new style of country, then women must have full opportunities to serve the country. British Liberal Party representative Peel said that India has not granted British merchants and British commerce completely equal treatment in several aspects, so the Liberal Party's future attitude will depend on whether British merchants obtain completely equal treatment. Liberal Party representative Keating said that if there are sufficient guarantees, the Liberal Party supports the policy of centralized power. Wen said that Britain will never fail to fulfill its responsibilities due to threats or riots. Sympathy, goodwill, and cooperation can win Britain's favor, and Britain is also willing to use this to win India's favor. Sir Saporu asked the British Prime Minister to release political prisoners so that a new era could be established and the struggles of the past few months could be forgotten. He also said that Indian representatives all have a feeling that British politicians are talking on an equal footing with a spirit of concession, rather than directing India. The conference has produced three concepts: one is the realization of the idea of an all-Indian federation, the second is the concentration of responsibility, and the third is that India will inevitably seek self-defense in the future. He knows that there may be some people in India who doubt this, but any autonomous constitution will have a part of the people who oppose it.</p>
<p>National News, London, 20th - Today, various morning newspapers have many comments on the conclusion of the Indian Round Table Conference. The labor and liberation party's official newspapers praised the Prime Minister's success this time, while the Daily Mail and the Daily Express took the opposite view, saying that the so-called solution to Indian colony affairs is nothing more than a dream. The Morning Post is more balanced, saying that it is hoped that Parliament's abandonment of rights on this matter is not as great as that of Mr. Mai. The Telegraph believes that after this conclusion, the purpose of this conference can be said to have been successfully achieved. The Times believes that the success this time has greatly exceeded the original hopes.</p>

<p>President of American Smelting Company on Opinion on Consolidating Silver Prices</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 19th - President of the American Smelting Company, Brownell, published a plan to consolidate silver prices to improve world trade, stating that there must be an informal understanding between Britain, the United States, and France: 1) They shall not sell all of their silver below a certain price within a certain period of time; 2) When the price of silver falls below a certain price, the governments should purchase silver for minting coins, with the amount purchased depending on their needs; 3) Governments, especially the Indian government, must wait until the price of silver is five cents higher than a certain price before selling the silver owned by the government. According to Brownell's opinion, India is the country most likely to sell the silver owned by the government in the near future, so India must agree to this plan. China and Japan must also be consulted and made to abide by the agreement, as must Spain, as Spain is the most likely to sell silver. This plan proposes organizing a commercial alliance, such as organizing one to protect the certificate market in times of market panic. However, this move can further verify the idea that Eastern trade is controlled by silver prices, and it can also stabilize silver prices until the current commercial crisis has passed, and it can prevent the East from immediately withdrawing cash from Europe. This plan is fundamentally aimed at restoring trade in silver-using countries, and it does not propose the issue of multiple currencies, and it avoids issues that are prone to controversy. Brownell also believes that this plan should be initiated by Britain or the United States. The United States' trade with China, Mexico, and other silver-using countries has greatly decreased, so it is urgent to find a way. It may be possible to immediately explore the attitude of the British government in an informal way and cooperate with them so that efforts to consolidate silver prices can be achieved.</p>

<p>Local News: Ministry of Finance Issues Guidelines for the Collection of Business Tax</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Regarding the resolution of the National Tax Reduction Committee meeting convened by the Ministry in July of the 17th year of the Republic of China, concerning the general outline for the collection of business tax in various provinces, Article 9 stipulated that the collection of business tax in each province should be based on the substantive regulations made after the completion of the elimination of Likin. Now that Likin and all taxes similar to Likin have been abolished, the business tax of various localities must be implemented in accordance with the original plan of the Likin Reduction Conference. However, the aforementioned outline is too brief, and matters that need to be clearly defined by item and those that need to be improved on a regular basis will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval after the Ministry has formulated thirteen supplementary measures, along with a copy of the general outline for the collection of business tax in various provinces. An instruction will be issued to the provinces to comply with the provisions of the case. Now, according to Instruction No. 65 of the Executive Yuan, after the implementation of Likin reduction, the provinces should gradually implement business tax, and all measures should be properly formulated for compliance. The matters presented are all feasible, and we should wait for a general order to be issued to the provincial and municipal governments for uniform compliance. In addition to instructing the various financial bureaus and municipal financial bureaus to comply with these instructions, and informing the various general chambers of commerce by telegram, the original text of the Ministry's report to the Yuan, the general outline for the collection of business tax in each province, and a copy of the supplementary measures will be sent to the provincial commercial associations. They must be uniformly informed, printed by the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<p>Petty taxation is a corrupt policy that harms businesses and the people.</p>
<p>The abolition of Likin is the legacy of our party's leader.</p>
<p>Opposing the abolition of Likin is tantamount to betraying the revolution.</p>
<p>Support our party in implementing the policy of Likin abolition.</p>

<p>The Two-Route Business Conference Closed Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Sincerely Implement the Resolutions of Each Case</p>
<p>The General Assembly Passed 98 Cases Yesterday</p>
<p>The two-route business conference of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways held its fifth meeting yesterday morning and extended its session. A total of 98 cases were passed in the afternoon session, and the general assembly was held in the afternoon after a solemn ceremony and passed a general assembly declaration to declare the adjournment. The details of yesterday will be recorded in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>Two Meetings</p>
<p>The fifth meeting was held from 9:30 a.m. yesterday, with more than 100 representatives and experts from various regions present. Luo Panhui presided, and Cai Jijun recorded the proceedings. After the formalities were completed, the chairman announced the opening of the meeting and publicly resolved the cases. In the second case, Vice Director Li Jingwei of the Transportation Group reported the results of the review of the 19 cases listed on the group's agenda. From Case 38 to Cases 46 and 47, the original text was adopted according to the review results. Next, Vice Director Wu Shuchang of the Station Affairs Group reported the review results of this group. From Case 148 to Case 185, except for Cases 161 and 174, which were not included in the group's review, all cases were passed. Next, Director Deng Xinyi of the Cargo Group reported the review results of this group. From Case 88 to Case 100, all cases were passed. From 2:00 p.m., the general meeting continued, with Liu Chengchang as the chairman. From Case 101 of the Cargo Group, discussions were held up to Case 108, which was also passed by the public. In addition, seven temporary proposals from the "Transportation Group," twenty from the "Station Affairs Group," and eight from the "Cargo Group" were completely passed according to the review results. Generally speaking, the cases mainly requested: (1) to reduce freight rates, but the railway bureau has already reduced what can be reduced, and it is temporarily impossible to reduce further due to the impact of rising gold prices; (2) for the railway bureau to be responsible for protecting freight and preventing leakage, the railway bureau has also agreed to pay close attention. In addition, the railway bureau has also accepted various proposals to increase vehicles and improve driving conditions. However, the last temporary proposal, "Case 34, the Two-Route Business Conference Bill, proposes the establishment of a dedicated agency to supervise the implementation at any time," was debated for a long time and was slightly disputed and rejected, as there was no need to organize such an agency.</p>
<p>Important Report</p>
<p>During the afternoon meeting, 12 temporary proposals were discussed. The China National Railway Association proposed that the railway directly handle freight transportation. Zheng Baozhao, the representative of the railway bureau, gave an important report, stating the reasons why the transportation company cannot be cancelled at present: (1) There are many rivers along the two routes, and most of the inland production is transported by waterway. Therefore, the railway transportation is handled by various transportation companies, which send personnel to the inland to solicit inland goods. If it is changed to railway transportation; (2) When merchants transport goods, they either lack capital or have difficulties in transferring cash. Therefore, they all use remittance methods, which are handled by the transportation companies; (3) Inland merchants are not familiar with the commercial conditions in various places. In order to save trouble when transporting goods, they are happy to have the transportation companies handle it on their behalf; (4) Merchants cannot afford to stay for a long time due to time or economic reasons. Therefore, once the goods are entrusted to the transportation company, the company will send someone to take care of it, without the need for the merchants to pay attention themselves; (5) The railway cannot immediately transport the goods directly, for the following reasons: A. The railway and the transportation company have a historical relationship, and the transportation company cannot be cancelled immediately; B. There are many people engaged in transportation, and if it is cancelled, there will be unemployment problems; C. The current transportation company handles transportation procedures on behalf of customers. If it is taken back and handled by the railway itself, it will be necessary to recruit additional personnel to be responsible for handling it. After careful planning, the annual expenses will exceed the annual commission earned by the transportation companies by more than one time, which seems to be detrimental to the railway bureau.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks</p>
<p>The meeting yesterday lasted until after 3:00 p.m., when all the cases had been discussed. The closing ceremony was held, and Director Liu Weichi gave a speech, saying: "The business conference has been held for five days since its opening. All the representatives have been able to work tirelessly to study the development of commercial transportation with the railway bureau. We are deeply grateful to all the representatives. This kind of courageous spirit is worthy of praise for both industry and commerce and the railway bureau. More than 100 resolutions have been passed at this meeting. The purpose is not only to be followed up and implemented on the surface. Since the late Premier Sun Yat-sen discovered the theory of knowing is difficult but acting is easy, and the theory of knowing is easy but acting is difficult has been disproved. One of the focal points of this meeting is to request a reduction in freight rates, and the other is to improve transportation methods. The railway bureau will implement these improvements as much as possible within its financial capacity. The income of the two routes was better in the 12th and 13th years of the Republic of China, and there was little difference in the previous year. This year, the rise in gold prices has had a significant impact on finances, but we are still trying to make various improvements and have not slackened in the slightest. We hope that the business community will cooperate sincerely in the future. All the representatives have come from afar, and we will host a banquet at Xinghualou to express our gratitude."</p>
<p>General Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>“Closing Declaration of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Business Conference”</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways deeply feel that the relationship between the two railways and commercial transportation is of great importance. The staff of the railway bureau, either due to limited knowledge or lack of consideration, or due to unfamiliarity with the situation, have failed to fully understand the difficulties of merchants. Therefore, a business conference was convened, bringing together representatives from the business community and relevant agencies, as well as railway experts, to discuss the development of business and the convenience of commercial transportation. With the kind support of all parties, the conference, although only six days long, has received more than 200 proposals. The discussions were insightful and insightful, and all participants engaged in sincere discussions and fully expressed their views. In total, more than 210 cases have been resolved within the conference period, all of which are for the grand plan of development and can be used as a good prescription for improvement. Governance is not just empty talk, and implementation depends entirely on perseverance. On the day of the closing of this conference, in addition to expressing our deep gratitude to all the representatives and experts, the committee will sincerely inform all parties that all the cases resolved this time will be fully implemented, so as not to disappoint the hard work of all of you and the intention of the convener of this committee. In the future, the prosperity of the two railways will be entirely due to the contributions of all of you. From now on, the improvement of commercial transportation along the line will also be based on this meeting, which will benefit the country and the people. This is a declaration. "Proposed by the Drafting Committee, Min Luo Ting, and passed on the first reading."</p>
<p>Yesterday Evening's Banquet</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau hosted a banquet at Xinghualou last night, and the staff of the two railways performed plays to entertain the guests. The representatives attended enthusiastically. Important officials from the Railway Bureau, including Director Liu Weichi, Luo Panhui, Liu Chengchang, Zheng Baozhao, Kuang Qianhua, and Hua Zejun, attended the banquet. Director Liu delivered a speech, and Feng Lunu, a representative of all the representatives, gave a reply, saying: "The Ministry of Railways of the National Government, in order to seek transportation development, commercial prosperity, and implement the legacy of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, and to plan for the benefit of the country and the people, convened a two-route business conference on January 15, presided over by Director Liu, Chief of General Affairs Luo, Chief of Transportation Liu, and Deputy Chief of Transportation Zheng. We were honored to be invited to the conference, where we were treated with great respect. We were able to present our humble opinions, which were carefully considered and incorporated into a good plan. We are grateful for the opportunity to attend this grand banquet and express our gratitude. However, we still have some hopes, believing that since the reform of the government, everything has been progressing. Now that the world is at peace and civilization is flourishing, the territory of the Republic of China is not inferior to other countries. In the past, we were constrained by economic constraints, and the abundant production areas of various provinces still felt the limitations of transportation. The people hope for the government's construction as much as they hope for rain in a severe drought. We dare to ask all of you to discuss this conference with the government and consider the difficulties of our colleagues, and try to build in places where transportation is hindered, to seek happiness for the merchants and the people, and to establish a foundation for the country, so that the southeastern region can benefit together. This is what we hope and pray for. If we are to contribute our humble opinions again, we will not refuse. These are our private wishes, and we believe that Director Liu and all the chiefs will agree. With this, we express our gratitude. January 20, 1931, the representatives of the two-route business conference." The representatives drank and watched the play until late at night and dispersed happily.</p>

<p>The Duties of the Fifth Division Commander</p>
<p>Hu Zuyu Has Not Yet Agreed to Take Office</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui Telephoned Jiang for Record Yesterday</p>
<p>After Xiong Shihui, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, resigned from the post of commander of the Fifth Division, the headquarters has appointed Hu Yusheng, the commander of the Thirteenth Brigade of the division, to fill the post. Colleagues from the garrison headquarters and the division headquarters have sent congratulatory telegrams to Hu. Hu sent a telegram to Commander Xiong yesterday, expressing his humility and unwillingness to take the post. Xiong replied by telegram, urging him not to decline again. Yesterday, Xiong also sent a telegram to Chairman Jiang, stating: "Reporting on the matter of requesting instructions. I previously telegraphed your seat to request resignation from my substantive post as commander of the Fifth Division because I need time to recuperate from illness and fear that it would hinder my duties. I am deeply grateful for your approval. From now on, I will be relieved of my responsibilities, and I will have no regrets. The day of anticipation is long, and the feeling of longing is doubled. All the reasons for requesting the cancellation of my substantive post as commander of the Fifth Division should be documented and submitted for review and filing. Respectfully submitted to the Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Jiang Zhang, Commander of the Fifth Division of the National Revolutionary Army, Xiong Shihui."</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Ferry Anti-Theft</p>
<p>Additional Armed Security Regiment</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo route, Shanghai Yinghua Shipping, joint operation, and continued contract signing have been recorded in this newspaper. Recently, since the Xinming case occurred, the Shanghai shipping industry has paid special attention to anti-theft matters. The Zhejiang shipping route is also designing and implementing measures. The anti-theft methods agreed upon by the various companies are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Additional Armed Guard Force</p>
<p>When the British merchant Taikoo Company and the Chinese merchants Sanbei, China Merchants, Ning Shao, and other bureaus were continuing to sign the contract for the Shanghai-Ningbo cooperative operation, they proposed defensive strategies for each wheel to ensure the safety of travelers. Now, due to the Xinming round robbery case, the four companies have advanced the anti-theft plan for the Ningbo shuttle boats. The four companies held another meeting on this matter and decided to add armed guard teams to the Xin Beijing, Xin Ning Shao, Xin Jiang Tian, and Ning Xing ships, divided into box cannons, rifles, and pistols. Each wheel will have 16 guards stationed in the cabins at all levels to protect the ship's voyages. The four companies unanimously agreed to implement the plan in February. It was also agreed to install iron fences outside the captain's room and the driver's room, so that they can be closed off in case of an alarm. In addition, each ship will inspect passengers disembarking every day to prevent bandits and military weapons from being mixed in. All the above methods have been decided and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Tea Room Union Article</p>
<p>The four-wheeled tea room union sent a letter to each company yesterday, saying that the Shanghai-Ningbo wheel has added 16 members of the security regiment to provide security and prevent accidents. This is a good and beautiful idea to protect the safety of passengers. There are still several points that the union believes should be considered, and they are listed as follows: (1) The river and sea bandits have a large number of followers. If they want to rob, the mere dozen or so members of the regiment will not be able to resist. If they are unfortunate enough to encounter thieves, if there are no regiment members, they will be allowed to search and rob. If there are regiment members, they will resist, but the result may not be enough to repel the thieves and protect the passengers. The lives of crew members and passengers may be endangered by flying bullets. (2) When the regiment members disembark, they have nothing to do. It is inevitable that they will cause trouble or extort money, and the disaster of harassment may be caused before the benefit of protection is obtained. (3) There are many workers transporting goods in Ningbo, and there is very little space in the boat. After the regiment members are set up, they will inevitably invade the passenger seats, which will affect the livelihood of the workers. In case of initial disagreements, disputes will only increase. Furthermore, the company will spend money to support these regiment members, which will waste money and damage the passenger seats. It is of no help and has disadvantages in all aspects. Why do this? After repeated discussions by the union, it is believed that the best way to achieve both goals is to have the crew members form their own security regiment to be responsible for security. The members of the regiment will be selected from the crew members, and the expenses will be borne by the company. This way, the number of people will be large and the strength will be strong. The bandits will not dare to start a conspiracy after hearing this news, and it will not hinder all parties. It is much better than setting up another security regiment. The four companies will hold another meeting on this matter and discuss it together before making a decision on whether to adopt it or not.</p>

<p>Eliminate the Smuggling of Private Goods</p>
<p>The smuggling of private goods on each ship is called a small package. The China Merchants Bureau has specially set up a South Warehouse Inspection Office to strictly inspect and often finds and punishes them. However, the Ningbo wheels still cannot eliminate this practice. The Taikoo Xin Beijing discovered 100,000 yuan of private goods smuggled the day before, and yesterday the China Merchants Bureau received a secret report from the Ningbo Bureau saying that the Xin Jiang Tian ship arriving in Ningbo had a large number of smuggled goods to Ningbo. The customs supervisor personally drove a small wheel to Zhenhai and waited for the Xin Jiang Tian to arrive. The ship was boarded and inspected, and the smuggled goods, such as north-south goods and fresh goods, amounted to more than 13 barge ships, which was the largest number of smuggled goods ever. The value of the goods was 16,700 taels of silver, and they were all detained by the Ningbo Customs and fined 1,670 yuan. It has been found that this large amount of small packages was packaged by a certain sailor on the ship. The sailor only goes to the ship once or twice a month, and the loss to the crew in the bureau is also quite large. General Manager Li was very angry when he received the news yesterday. He said that the sailor dared to engage in private affairs and smuggle goods, which damaged the company's reputation. He has ordered the business department to investigate and formulate measures to eliminate this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Yunnan Goods Transiting Vietnam and Myanmar Tax Law</p>
<p>The Final Port Should Be Indicated on the Export Declaration</p>
<p>Mei Weiliang, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that he received a letter from the Chamber of Commerce on January 14, saying that he had received a letter from Duan Xiping, a merchant in this city, stating that merchants have historically traded in Yunnan and Myanmar, and traded in medicinal materials. The goods are directly reported to Shanghai from Tengyue and imported into Shanghai. Whether it is circulated in the country or not, no tax is paid. Or, if foreign goods are imported, the goods are first loaded in Yangon and then transferred to Hong Kong, and then transferred to Shanghai. Is it calculated as domestic goods or foreign goods? Please indicate, etc. According to the opinions of this association, the goods held by the Tengyue Customs export tax form are the same as the transshipment of foreign goods, and no additional tax is required. Is it appropriate? You should send a letter to inquire and inform to rely on it for reply, etc. According to this, and according to the merchant's letter, the opinion of your association is correct. For example, if a merchant ships goods from Tengyue to Shanghai, or from Shanghai to Tengyue, through Myanmar, Hong Kong, etc., the merchant should indicate the final port of destination on the export declaration and add a duplicate declaration, which will be sent to that port by the Customs. If the verification is consistent, tax exemption should be approved. It should be replied to for verification and notification.</p>

<p>Educational News and Important Matters: Statistical Overview of the Ministry of Education's Work in the Last Half Year (1) The Ministry of Education will compile a statistical report on the work overview from June to December of the 19th year.

Yang Zhou Primary School Teachers Strike Due to Salary Arrears No Date Set for Payment, No Date Set for Resumption of Classes Due to the huge accumulation of arrears in Jiangdu primary school funding, classes have not started since the New Year. On the teaching staff side, it is required that at least three and a half months be paid before the Lunar New Year, but the county government and the bureau have repeatedly negotiated with the clerks, initially promising to pay 30,000 yuan for the old debts and to collect the new taxes on a daily basis from the bureau to the treasury. It is estimated that by the end of the Lunar New Year, more than 30,000 yuan can be expected. In any case, three months' salary can be paid, and it was promised that one month's salary would be paid first today (the 19th) to ensure that the schools can start classes. However, the clerks change their minds from morning to night, and even if they promise to continue, they never meet the deadline no matter how much they are urged. The county government has no way to restrain their slipperiness. Therefore, the payment for the first month has not been made. The teaching staff believe that the date for settling accounts and repaying debts is approaching, and if the clerks continue to be so cunning, then even two months' salary before the Lunar New Year is hopeless. Therefore, in addition to not holding classes today, they will also meet at the Education Bureau to discuss countermeasures. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) Motion to post slogans: Passed. (2) Motion to hold a parade: Retained. (3) Regarding whether schools will resume classes after the most recent payment of one month's salary: Resolved that classes will not resume until there is sufficient guarantee for the remaining two and a half months. Guarantee measures: (A) Use promissory notes from money shops as collateral. (B) The county bureau shall stipulate a definite payment date, jointly announce it, and require reputable money shops to guarantee it. (4) Motion to have a thorough payment plan for the remaining months of salary arrears after the payment of the three and a half months' of funding: Passed. (5) Motion that colleagues' treatment should not be reduced: Resolved that everyone should receive their old salary. (6) Motion to enlarge the declaration and write more than a dozen copies to be posted throughout the streets: Passed. (7) Motion to send two representatives from each school to work at the bureau: Passed, etc. Student Representatives Studying in Japan in This Port Hosted the Press To Petition the Government for Gengkuan Assistance Student representatives studying in Japan, Lu Fubao, Cui Zhafeng, etc., arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru the day before yesterday afternoon. Last night, they hosted the local press at Tao Lechun. First, Lu Fubao reported that he was recommended to return to the country to petition the government for the issue of Gengkuan subsidies. Its purpose is to request the government to still use a portion of the Gengkuan for subsidizing the tuition fees of students studying in Japan after the abolition of the cultural agreement, and to request the government to find ways to relieve impoverished students to avoid dropping out of school and being displaced between the suspension of Gengkuan subsidies and the abolition of the cultural agreement. Next, He You explained the relationship between the suspension of Gengkuan subsidies and the abolition of the cultural agreement, and explained general misunderstandings. It is heard that thousands of students studying in Japan have dropped out of school and returned to the country due to the impact of the rising price of gold. The graduation period of each student who has entered a formal school is only one or two years apart. At this time, the price of Japanese gold has skyrocketed, and the cost of living is high. They are unwilling to abandon their studies and return to the country, and they have no way to continue to maintain their studies. Their difficulties and hardships cannot be described in words. The representatives plan to go to the capital to petition on the morning of the 22nd.

Current Status of China Public School Since the start of the first semester of the 19th academic year, the number of students at China Public School has reached 1,400, which is a new record for the school. Recently, Dr. Ma Junwu, the president of the school, expanded the original Department of Literature and History into three departments in order to improve the students' academic ability: (1) Department of Literature, (2) Department of Education and Philosophy, (3) Department of History and Geography. The Departments of Literature and Education still belong to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, while the Department of History and Geography belongs to the College of Social Sciences. Newly Appointed Deans and Department Heads The school is divided into three colleges: (1) College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, (2) College of Business, (3) College of Social Sciences. Currently, the deans of the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences and Business are still Hu Shi and Liu Binglin. The dean of the College of Social Sciences is Pan Guangdan, as Gao Yihan has resigned long ago. There have also been changes in the department heads, including (1) Li Qingcui as the head of the Department of Literature, (2) Quan Zenghu as the head of the Department of Education and Philosophy, (3) Yang Honglie as the head of the Department of History and Geography, (4) Dr. Ling Shumo as the head of the Department of Banking and Accounting. Dr. Ling Shumo was originally the dean of academic affairs at China Public School, but he has now resigned, and Ren Jian, the former dean of academic affairs at Guanghua University, has been invited to succeed him. Newly Hired Professors The school has hired a large number of new professors due to the expansion of the departments, including Zheng Zhenduo, Zhuan Donghua, Chen Wangdao, Xie Liuyi, Hong Shen, Zhang Shiru, and Lin Rulin in the Department of Literature; Quan Zenghu, Li Shicen, Shen Yougan, and Ren Jian in the Department of Education and Philosophy; and Pan Guangdan, He Bingsong, Tao Xisheng, and Zhang Ziping in the Department of History and Geography. It is also heard that there are many other people being contacted, but it is difficult to investigate them all at once. It is also heard that there have been very few changes in the original department heads, professors, and staff. New Look of Junyi Middle School Junyi Middle School on Puyu Chong Road in this city has taken on a new look since the establishment of a branch school this semester. The branch school is exclusively for male boarders. The rooms taken over in the main school, in addition to expanding the office, library, chemistry laboratory, and recreation room as much as possible, can also be used to set up four or five girls' dormitories. The school still has surplus rooms for girls' dormitories, and is currently continuing to recruit female students.

International Football Tournament China vs. France This Saturday at the Recreation Ground Zhen Ru Goes to the Philippines, New Players to Be Recruited The Shanghai International Football Championship is hosted by the Westerners' Association. It specially announced the schedule yesterday, setting China against France this Saturday, the 24th, at the Recreation Ground. When the sports authorities in our country saw this declaration of war, they announced that the athletes of Zhen Ru had already gone to the Philippines, and it was inevitable that they would feel that distant water could not quench a fire nearby. However, they had to plan a way to deal with it, and immediately recruited elite players from various teams in Shanghai to supplement the troops in order to meet the enemy. Although France is not very strong, it is necessary to be careful in order to ensure success. Therefore, eight representatives and the originally scheduled personnel have been temporarily appointed. The list is recorded below: Zhou Xianyan (Lehua), Li Ning (Lele), Zhu Qiu (Youyou), Hu Minteng (Hujiang), Shen Guanlan (Jiaotong University), Fei Fuxu (Jiaotong University), Chen Pu (Lingnan), Chen Hongguang (Lingnan), Huang Zhaoguang (Lingnan), Zhou Shaowen, Guan Wenan, Yu Shunzhang (three from Fudan), Xi Qiaosheng (Guanghua), Lu Jinen, Chen Yutian (two from Lehua), Ouyang Yongnian (Hujiang).

The Education Bureau convened a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 14th at the bureau, inviting all schools and sports organizations in the city to prepare everything. Those present included Yang Wenyun, representing Chongde; Chen Chang, representing Tiezhong; Zhang Ruiji, representing Licun Middle School; Gu Yuanrong, representing Lixian; Song Guomo, representing the Sports Federation; Wang Yuliang, representing the Wanguo Sports Association; Zhang Zhachu, representing the Municipal Middle School; Sun Puru, representing the Municipal Girls' Middle School; and Xu Kezhang and Tan Kezhang from the Education Bureau.

However, before the funds are raised, the city can hold a basketball and football tournament as preparation for participation, and it was decided to publish a notice in the newspaper until the 20th of this month as the reporting date. Any men's basketball team or football team in the city can register. The registered teams should also send one representative to the Education Committee at 3:00 PM on the 21st to discuss all matters related to the competition. On the one hand, the Education Bureau will send a letter to the preparatory office of the North China Football and Basketball Tournament to inquire about the following matters: (1) Can the transportation costs for the city's team members to Peiping on the Jiaoji and Pingpu Railways be waived or given a half-price discount? (2) Does this North China Football and Basketball Tournament have a women's division? (3) What rules will be used for this North China Football and Basketball Tournament, and please send a copy for reference. (4) Will the basketball competition be held indoors or outdoors?

Most of the overseas Chinese youth in the Philippines who have received higher education in China come from this university. Therefore, the general public has a deep impression of any university in China. The fact that its football team came to the Philippines for competition has been rumored for a long time. When the director of sports, Mr. Chen Zhang'e, was about to leave the Philippines to take up a new position, he had such aspirations, and now that they have been realized, it is also a noteworthy event that has caused a sensation in the overseas Chinese community. Now, I will jot down the reasons for coming to the Philippines and the situation on the day of arrival, and mail it to this column from the original ship. It is also what domestic sports enthusiasts would like to see first. 1. The Charity Association's cordial invitation to the Philippines The Charity Association is established by the Catholic Church. Every year during the first month, it holds a fair of varying sizes. The admission tickets are distributed in advance to Chinese and foreign community groups for sale. The ticket surface lists the number. After the meeting, lottery tickets are drawn, and the first prize is a golden windmill worth 3,000 yuan. Every year, in addition to expenses, the income is always 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, which is used to subsidize orphanages, nursing homes, and relieve unemployment. This year, they are trying a different trick, wanting to invite Chinese and Japanese athletes to come to the Philippines for competition, in order to increase ticket revenue. The Jinan football team has repeatedly won championships in Shanghai, which is well known at home and abroad. The Manila Sports Association, Regeno R. Glaua, and the current director of sports at Jinan, Mr. Chen Zhang'e, are also old acquaintances. Therefore, they contacted the Jinan football team to come here for competition. The ticket revenue belongs to the charity association, and the round-trip fares for the players are in second-class seats, and each person is provided with 5 yuan per day for food and accommodation, all provided by the association. 2. Rejecting a 20,000-Yuan Package Deal for Arena Tickets This time, the event also invited a Japanese Kendo team to the Philippines for competition, which has aroused great attention from all walks of life. A certain entertainer capitalist wanted to package the Jinan football, basketball, and Japanese tickets for 20,000 yuan, which was rejected by the charity association. According to the announcement by the association's general manager, the package fee of 20,000 yuan can be said to be very suitable for charity, but for the sake of reputation, they are not willing to accept this kind of offer. This kind of package deal is to allow private individuals to manipulate the competition of the invited athletes, using the athletes' skills as a sales model, which inevitably contains a commercial color. Therefore, the authorities of the charity association would rather raise funds through a bright and upright approach, so that they can be worthy of the Chinese and Japanese athletes. From this, we can also see the appeal of the Jinan football team. 3. Jinan and Chinese and Western Alumni Welcome Chinese and Western schools are the oldest (32 years) and most populous overseas Chinese schools in the Philippines. Their alumni have distinguished themselves in society and have a special relationship with Sheng Nan. In the past, many alumni who graduated from domestic universities came from this school. Secondly, there are also many people who are currently studying at Jinan University in China, and the people in charge often communicate with each other. Therefore, upon hearing that the Jinan football team was coming, the members were very happy. The day before, they sent a wireless telegram to the ship to welcome them and prepared various welcome procedures upon arrival. There are also more than 20 alumni of Jinan University in Manila. They do not hesitate to travel to see the skills of their alma mater's athletes, and naturally there will be a considerable expression. 4. The arrival of Jinan was a magnificent sight. The Japanese Empress ship is the largest ship of the Xingchang Company on the Pacific route. It entered the port at 7 o'clock on the 12th and docked at Pier No. 7 at 8 o'clock. Those who welcomed them on the shore included the Jinan Alumni Association, led by Mr. Yang Guobiao, with more than 20 people, each holding a small school flag, which was given to each alumnus at the time of graduation. Once the flags fluttered in the wind, they had a special color. The Chinese and Western school alumni were led by Mr. Lin Zhuguang, with more than 30 people, each wearing a badge. Others included Mr. Wang Quansheng, the principal of Puzhi School, Mr. Yu Yitong, the representative of the Commercial News, Yu Yongrong, the representative of the Chamber of Commerce, and many others who wanted to see the demeanor of the players and went on their own initiative. On the Philippine side, there were staff members of the Charity Association and many field reporters from various newspapers. At that time, Pier No. 7 had a new look. I also boarded the ship with everyone and saw my old friend, Mr. Dui Zhang'e. After more than half a year since we last met, he is in better shape. Having lived in Southeast Asia for a long time, and returning to his homeland, the climate is better, and his body is naturally more comfortable. Among the football team members, Mr. Chen Zhenhe, Mr. Chen Bingxiang, Mr. Dai Linjing, Mr. Chen Jiaqiu, Mr. Feng Yunyou, and Mr. Fu Hexuan used to come here to compete with the Lehua team and played the song of triumph. Today, they are revisiting the guest land with a magnificent spirit. The basketball team members all wore uniforms with the Jinan Zhizhi badge embedded in the middle. They looked energetic. The rest of the athletes were also talking and laughing, without any fatigue. Those who had not experienced the wind and waves of this sea voyage were taken by various newspapers after they landed. Currently residing at the Chinese Youth Association. 5. The basketball competition dates have been set. January 16th Zhenru vs. All Manila United School Team January 19th Zhenru vs. Manila Overseas Chinese Team (a friendly match that does not belong to the scope of the Charity Association) January 23rd Zhenru vs. Shandun Marshi Team January 26th Zhenru vs. Dianyao Middle School Team January 30th Zhenru vs. All-Philippines Star Team The football competition dates had been announced, but they were not set due to the team members' separate agreement with the merchants.</p>

<p>Free Talk A Laughing Matter Hai Ke Youngster: Little brother, is your sister coming out today? Boy: She has something to do at home today. She's not coming out. Youngster: I gave her a ring last week. Did she like it? Boy: She thinks your ring is too small. Because when her other boyfriends come to see her, she doesn't have time to take it off. American: Today I want to buy a wreath. Friend (looking surprised): Huh? Why buy a wreath? Isn't tomorrow your wedding day? American: Yes.

He spoke of the new architecture in his hometown. Recorded below. The Grandeur of Guanyin Mountain Guanyin Mountain is Yuexiu Mountain. The entire mountain is surrounded by roads, making transportation convenient, unmatched by Beijing. The beauty of the scenery has long been known. It has now been developed into a park, with the Sun Yat-sen Monument built on top of it. There is a hollow staircase that can be climbed directly to the top, the highest point in the city. Overlooking the entire city, all things are arranged in order. Thousands of years of secrecy are revealed at once. At the foot of the mountain is the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, standing in contrast above and below, enough to see the sincerity of the Cantonese in worshiping the Premier. There is also the Zhongyuan Library, with beautiful architecture and a rich collection. There is also the Five-Story Building, which has always been famous for its historical sites, and has now been converted into a museum. It is said that Lychee Bay will also be developed into a park. The ground will be completed every day. One mountain and one water are also enough to compete with each other. The Transformation of Hebei Road The roads of Guangzhou are divided into three phases of construction. The first phase is to build important streets in prosperous areas. The second phase is to build convenient transportation routes. The third phase is to build the remaining streets and alleys. The first phase has been completed. The second phase has begun, and the third phase is not far away. Among them, Yonghan Road is the best, comparable to Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai. The other areas such as Changdi Dawei Road and the upper and lower Jiu Fu in Xiguan Seventeen Eight Pu are also not to be outdone. When I returned to my hometown, I was still a child. I can still recall the rugged streets, and after ten years of separation, I cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitudes. Development of Henan Henan is the southern part of Guangzhou. The terrain is a delta, and commerce is quite developed. However, the streets are not very tidy. It is heard that the provincial government will set up a joint office in Henan, so various streets will be built to facilitate transportation. The South Bank Road, which was once a prosperous area, has now been successfully opened. There is also the Yanhe Second Road. However, the Yanhe Road still needs economic affluence before it can be built. Today, there is another amazing large-scale building, namely the movable iron bridge that runs across the north and south banks, at the center of the city. There are plans for three bridges, but now due to economic difficulties, only one will be built first. It can be completed next summer. After it is completed, the commerce of Henan will definitely be better than that of Hebei. Looking at the major commercial ports in the country, Guangzhou is the only one with an iron bridge that can span both banks. Some say that Guangzhou is the most developed city in our country, and it is well-deserved. Perch Recipe Yang Yixiao Perch Sashimi The Songjiang perch is cooked and sliced into sashimi. The meat is white as snow and has no fishy smell. It is called the golden jade sashimi, a delicacy of Southeast China. Perch Soup The Songjiang perch is sliced into thin slices and placed in a pot. Add ham, chicken broth, and a little salt. Cook for five minutes. It tastes delicious and the meat is firm. Perch Lungs Take several Songjiang four-gill perch, dissect their abdomens and take out the lungs. Add winter bamboo shoots and snow vegetables, and a little chicken broth. Simmer over low heat. It tastes fresh and tender. Divine Punishment Chen Shuping Divine punishment refers to cursing someone to not have a good end. Unexpectedly, it was recently rumored that a man outside Shuixi Gate suffered this tragedy. I was surprised by this and asked an old neighbor. The old man was a knowledgeable scholar. According to him, this is a kind of yin disease, similar to human-faced sores. The patient must have committed many evils and escaped the law, resulting in this冥报. Once infected with this disease, one must endure all kinds of pain, and then the body rots, gradually becoming thinner, and eventually vanishes into nothing. Driven by curiosity, on a clear Sunday morning, I went with my friend Zhang to see the strangeness. After leaving the West Gate and asking around, we finally reached our destination. According to the local farmers, the patient was a beggar, living under the eaves of a dilapidated temple. Following their guidance, we saw a beggar sitting on the steps, about forty years old, leaning against the wall in the sun. When he caught sight of us, he was shocked as if struck by electricity and tried to escape, shouting that the visitors were approaching. I quickly stopped him and gave him a silver dollar, and then I was able to examine him in detail. I saw that the beggar's entire body was covered with small holes, and maggots were wriggling in the holes, like rice worms, but they were black and slightly flat. It is said that once they see a living person, the maggots immediately burrow into the skin, causing an unbearable itch. After a while, it is followed by excruciating pain, as if being stabbed with needles. The cause of the disease is quite peculiar. Several years ago, on a summer night, he was lying naked, and he dreamed of an old man sprinkling him with a sesame斗. The body turned into lice, burrowing into the skin. When he woke up, he had this strange condition. After a year, yellow liquid gradually oozed from the holes. The body became thinner day by day, and his height has been shortened by several inches. Now he only seeks a quick death, so that he can leave the sea of suffering. We listened to his words and felt sorry for him. On the way back, because our legs were numb, we went to a small teahouse by the roadside for a rest. We were talking about this matter when the tea shop owner heard us and said, "The beggar's surname is Wang, and he knows some boxing skills. When he was young and strong, he was a bully. He liked to wander around and did not engage in production. After the restoration, he specialized in being a guide for bandits. As a result, the wealthy and the enemies who were harmed are too numerous to count. Now he has received this retribution, so why pity him?" Everyone who heard this sighed. Because what I saw with my own eyes is not comparable to hearsay, I recorded the outline here to tell those in the world who do not believe in retribution. Chinese Massage in Ancient Times Song Lu Yesterday, I read Mr. Qiushui's article "Massage Examination," which describes the origin and development of massage in great detail. The article also has a note that says, "The art of massage is called 推拿 in China." The tone of the note seems to suggest that the name "massage" is quite new, or even suspected of being adopted from the West. In fact, the art of massage has a long history in China. Let me cite a passage from the "Plum Girl" chapter of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" as a reference. "......This concubine understands the art of massage. I am willing to use my skills to accompany you in your dreams." Feng accepted her request. The woman folded her palms and gently massaged him, from the neck to the heels. Wherever her hands passed, the bones felt drunk. Then she grasped his fingers and gently rubbed them, as if touching them with cotton. The body was unspeakably comfortable. When she rubbed his waist, his mouth and eyes were tired. When she rubbed his thighs, he fell into a deep sleep. When he woke up, the sun was already past noon. His bones and joints were clear and harmonious, unlike in the past......" The above few words not only describe the art of massage vividly. According to "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" was written by Pu Liuxian. Pu was a person of the early Qing Dynasty, so what he recorded is not ancient enough. Now, we should also refer to two annotations by Lu Zhan'en in the book. "In the Zhou Rituals, the Tianguan (official in charge of health) used the five flavors, five grains, and five medicines to nourish the sick. The commentary says, 'Liu Xiang and Bian Que treated the illness of the Crown Prince of Zhao who was like a corpse, making Ziming boil the soup, Ziyi feel the pulse, and Zishu massage him.'" "Also, in the "Book of Tang, Biographies of Officials," it says, "The</p>
