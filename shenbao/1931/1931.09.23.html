<p>派遣委員赴满調查</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國代表施肇基公使今日正式向國際聨盟申請干涉满洲事件、國聨理事會應施公使之待請、遂召集特别理事會、施公使之請求書、即于特别理事會中提出、满洲方面形勢嚴重、此事件影響國聨之威信及其地位至巨且大、主席西班牙外長勒樂宣布開會、邀請中國代表提出請求書時、國聨會塲異常擁擠、施公使即起立朗誦南京政府官電多通、詳述日軍侵略情形、且謂中國領土已被日軍蹂躙者、其範圍廣大如英倫三島、施公使續稱、日軍攻佔如許中國領土、其野心猶方興未艾、形勢日趨險惡絶無疑義、假令日軍侵略行動不加裁制、中國惟有引用國聨公約其他條文、作進一步之申訴、最後施公使希望國聨仗義執言、出而干涉、必能息止日軍暴行、恢復戰前原狀、而保證中國所受日軍軍事行動之全部損失、獲得賠償、日代表芳澤繼起發言竭力伸辯、堅稱日軍在满洲人數較華軍爲少、據其從本國政府寄到之情報、衝突起於華兵之挑撥、芳澤續謂中國要求賠償、「簡直不可思議」蓋以此事責任在華而不在日也、芳澤更責問中國有何權根據國聨公約第十一條、而向國聨申訴、彼堅稱此爲不可准許、因此衝突祗能詳密研究當地情形後、就地解决、日政府之意、此爭執祗關中日兩國、日政府已竭力使其爲地方事件、日政府爲避免衝突擴大起見、主張兩關係國直接交涉爲最好辦法、最後芳澤稱、彼今仍未接得本國政府之具體訓令、故對中國要求國聨干涉一節、不能表示態度、爲此請求理事會將此全部問題、延至下次會議討論、施公使起立答復、堅稱渠之報告、完全眞確、國聨盡可組織特别調查委員會以明眞相、該委員會如能秉公澈查、則中國實所樂觀其及早組織、關于日本力主直接交涉一節、世界决無其國領土被人佔領、而甘受此屈辱之條件者、必先恢復戰前原狀、始有直接談判之可言、中國代表更稱、國聨自有權力干涉此事、實屬絶無疑問、最後施公使謂芳澤聲明日本不認此項衝突、成爲戰爭行爲、固所歡迎、惟理事會須注意遠東戰事迫在眉睫、國際如不毅然决然、及早設法挽回、必有一發不可收拾之一日、芳澤於是重申前請、竭力希望先行散會、以待其接得具體訓令後再議、結果似已失敗、蓋下午一時討論仍在進行也云云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中日代表舌戰中、英代表薛西爾突然起立參加意見、先謂國聨現在所處地位、固不能解决此問題之咎屬於誰、嗣請主席援據成例、一面申請中日兩國、政府阻止形勢擴大、一面力勸日本撤退侵入满洲軍隊、薛氏最後宣稱、吾人必須承認此問題已超越國聨、而涉及凱洛格非戰公約與太平洋四國公約、美國亦其簽字國、故對此問題亦甚注意、因美國亦關心此事、故余主張吾人將理事會關於此問題討論經過、全部通知美國、使華盛頓政府完全明瞭吾人之步驟云云、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）理事會下午三時散會、理事會授權主席勒樂、即向中日兩國政府發出緊急通知書、申請避免擴大形勢、並要求日本即將軍隊撤退至原地、及恢復戰前原狀、理事會並於英首席代表薛西爾阻止中日代表雄辨後、議决派遣委員會至满洲調查、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中日間衝突事、今日國聨提出未有决議、但英代表薛西爾於辯論時力持軍隊家立即退至原防、以免事態愈臻嚴重之說、行政會討論此事、歷兩小時之久、中日雙方代表所提出之文、在許多重要點上互相抵觸、薛西爾稱、满洲現所發生之事件、乃任何國家所應避免者、渠請中日雙方各避免之、行政會尚未悉起釁之原因、及其程度、但渠以爲在調查雙方案件時、各軍宜退回原駐地點云、薛西爾繼言及與美國有關之國際條約、並引凱洛格非戰公約、及華府公約、末謂行政會之議事紀錄應通告美國云、日代表建議此事宜由中日兩國直接談判解决之、行政會旋休會作私人討論、半小時後復行集議、議長聲稱、非公開的討論、未能使渠提出關於满洲問題之决議云、定午後三時半再議、衆信行政會將主張遣派陸軍隨員調查日軍行爲所造成之現狀、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國際聨人員今日承認中國之訴請理事會干涉满洲事件、將便國聨試騐有無弭戰之實力、明日理事會將集議考慮中國之請願文、各國代表莫不殷切注意、中政府致國聨之請願文措詞甚爲嚴重、請理事會即速阻止事勢擴大、以免危及各國之和平、並令日軍退出所佔之地、然後决定中國應有之賠償、文中詳紀日軍强暴各節、並聲明中國軍民絶未予以抗拒、衆料國聨理事會將即請中日兩國當局各下令將軍隊撤至不易衝突之地點、一面由遠東外交與軍事代表組織委員團、實地調查眞相、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）聚集此間之各國政治家、聞日本表示不願第三者干涉其在南满之軍事行動、頗爲憂慮、一般人士皆覺國際聨盟之威信、現處危險之中、再若中國援引凱洛格非戰公約、訴請國聨理事會出任調解、則將何以爲應、惟聞國聨爲道德的義務所驅使、不得不有所行動、即使引起日本之惡感、亦所不惜、至於國聨準備採取之行動、性質如何、現尚非常含糊、而中國代表團今夜已發表宣言、謂國聨中國理事施肇基公使將於明日正式請求國聨仲裁南满事件、國聨所處地位之困難、於電此可見一斑、（二十一日國民）</p>
<p>（北平）施肇基二十二晨十時、將中國訴願書、送達國聨秘書長、要求三點、（一）緊急動議、使日本立即停止軍事行動、並限制事件之擴大、（二）恢復事件發生前之原狀、（三）保留一切損害賠償、國聨已正式接收中國之訴願、（二十二日專電）</p>

<h3>國人乎速猛醒奮起</h3>
<p>今日中央通令全國爲我東北被日軍暴行殘殺之同胞誌哀。并誌國恥。我</p>
<p>我國國民今日立於飄揚於颯颯秋風中之半面國旗下。默念我大好山河之</p>
<p>殘破。默念我民族當前之危難。是熱血。男兒都應椎心泣因是熱血男兒都應</p>
<p>勇敢奮起。</p>
<p>今日之事。痛哭不足以救國。輕舉不足以救國。待助於人尤不足以救國。救國在於積極有效之行動。在於萬衆一心之團結。</p>
<p>種族凌夷。山河破碎。我舉國同胞。固應同聲痛哭。此而不哭更何事可哭。然而灑盡血涙。終無以洒我國家我民族今日之恥辱。終無補於當前之大難。如公理尚未氓盡。如人類尚未死滅。此乘人危難之暴行。吾人固希望世界予以有效之裁制。然而待人救命。終屬可望而不可即。公理常在於强者之掌握。誰肯出而作仗義之言。故今日之事。一言可决。惟自助乃能自救。惟奮鬥乃能圖存。退讓即爲自殺。即爲坐待滅亡。逞日人之野心。勢非囊括我國家滅亡我民族不止。瀋陽之暴行。吉林之襲擊。戕我軍民。踞我土地。我方已無抵抗退讓矣。然而日人之暴行。曾不稍戢。抑且有加無已。我退至山海關。日亦逼至山海關。設我退至北平。退至上海。退至南京。而日人仍節節進逼。我其將終始退讓毫不抵抗耶。昨日滬市黨部致中央電中有云。「縱云力求退讓。亦必有退讓之限度。縱云願聽宰割。亦宜自擇裁割之方法。」言至沉痛。奮鬥死。坐待亦死。若者爲得。吾人應有以自擇。城下之盟。可一而不可再。因循坐視。毫不自主。其將令文明古國。大好山河。今日遂覆滅於吾人之手乎。今非戰公約之精神與信條。吾已遵守於先矣。惟自衞乃能自救。惟熱血乃能洗恥。我國家於今日忍無可忍。讓無可讓之際。亟應力謀所以抗暴力。謀所以自衞。換言之。即應爲維護國家維護民族。而作自讏之背城戰。</p>
<p>全國國民際此大難。應本孫中山先生「和平奮鬥」之旨。以鎭靜之態度。抱必死之决心。化除内爭一致禦外。勿輕舉妄動。勿無益犧牲。但使人人具此覺悟。具此决心。號角一鳴。隨時可以奮袂而起。爲國效命。此時農工商各界更應加緊工作。爲萬一時期之準備。至於青年。國脈所繫。肩頭責任。尤爲艱鉅。此時更應澈底覺悟。急起奮鬥。積極鍜練身心。堅决意志。讀書不忘救國。救國不忘讀書。宜以德意志土耳其蘇聨新興民族精神爲師法。艱苦自磨。作有效之奮鬥。作正當之犧牲。作永久之堅持。</p>
<p>千鈞一髮。禍迫眉睫。禍福存亡。决在今日。天災外寇。皆足以亡我。我欲不亡。惟有自動自救。拿破崙曾有言。「東方有」個巨人。長是酣睡着。讓他睡罷。因爲當他醒來。他立即可以震撼全世界」。今日嚴重之天災與外患。即爲震起我民族酣夢之洪鐘以我國之地大物博民衆。假如决然奮起。何恥不可雪。何患不可滅。當前並不足懼。尤不足悲。但須覺醒團結。共同奮鬥。</p>

<p>（柏林）德國報紙雖在歐洲多事之秋、而對於满洲事件、仍極注意、但均登載事實而未加以批評、惟民衆與政界之意見、可以柯爾尼希報社論中之言概括之、即德國對此新爭端、雖深爲扼腕、並不勝驚懼、但仍將嚴守中立、德國現維持與中日兩國篤厚之邦交、而深願紛擾已甚之國際現局、勿再爲類於戰爭之事端所摇動云、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>爲日禍敬告國人</h3>
<p>（九二老人馬相伯）</p>
<p>痛改前非　共赴國難</p>
<p>自贖自救　復興邦家</p>
<p>今日舉國爲日禍誌哀。余雖老邁。亦一國民。天責所在。義不容辭。抒己見以勗。國人。</p>
<p>際此天災人禍外憂内患迭乘。國人應曉。邦分崩離析而不能守。即所謂國必自伐而後人伐之。爲今計。最上策祇有自贖自救之一途耳。推求目前種種太不幸。强半自作蘖不可活。言財盡耶。財盡於歲費數萬萬之軍餉。伏而國防毫無設備。言民窮耶。民窮猶年耗數千萬之鴉片。然而河防絶不計及。由是禍亂猝發。十六省胥成澤國。强鄰幸災樂禍。大舉入寇。於是我山海關外領土主權已蹂躙無餘矣。魯難未已。孰爲慶父。人心未厭亂。故天禍中國。試靜思之。湖北伐湖南。廣西征廣東。本是同根相煎迫。寗有得失之可言。而二十年内戰循環。如出一轍。悲夫。國家貧弱。至於此極。政府無緊縮之策。民間有奢侈之風。國民道德。日益墮落。國民生計。日益困苦。况復禍亂當頭。追懷已往歷史之光榮。先民締造之文化遺産。授吾儕以大好文明古國。我後世子子孫孫。雖不能發揚光大祖業。亦應克繩祖武。不失爲一泱泱大國。然後始不愧立國於天地間。今後國民。各抱决心。痛改前非。自贖自救。羣策羣力。共赴國難。則十年生聚敎養。終有自强振作之一日。乃若古哲成湯衞武修己自責。亦庶幾上回天心。挽救國運。蓋非先恢復固有民族道德之精神。决無忠實肯犧牲爲國之國民。可斷言也。國民如無責任心則己。有則請立即誓從今日起。自贖自救。共赴國難。抑有進者。日本明治維新以還。民智民德之猛進。令人刮目相看久矣。三島小民族自負東亞大國民。東攘西奪。已非一日。其處心積慮。以謀佔我東三省諸領域。茲近三十年。專家設計。秘密遺行。乃我大夢未醒。臥榻任人酣睡。兩三年來。始稍注意。（如專設日本研究社諸團體是）彼知我而我不知彼。兵不待决戰而成敗自定。此次日軍强佔我遼吉諸名城。直不啻探囊取物。而我實無絲毫抵抗而忍受。又何異束手待斃。山河坐失。無涙可揮。彼日本人發揮其日耳曼第二之兇燄。昭和甘効威廉第二作戎首。前者暗偷私竊。今則乘火打刦。最近之暴行。如搶我銀行。刦我民衆等。早置國際公法非戰公約於不屑道及之列矣。此種行徑。形同國際强盜。實係如曩日之德國。對世界之一種威嚇。種種暴行。今日可施之於中國東三省。安知他日不依法泡製。對付英美德法諸國乎。故國際間有不满意於日軍暴行之公論。非必見好或市惠於我也。抑列國自衞所應採以之政策。國人固宜對主持正義者表示好感。然一味仗人執言之惡習不根本剷除。斷然無能自贖自救。幸加意焉。</p>
<p>嗟我民國主權在民。所望眞正民意。澈底充分表現。立息内爭。共禦外侮。老邁如余。佇望我父母之邦。永久如磐石之安。故不憚費口舌。將自贖自救之大義。爲我邦人君子剖陳之。惟最令痛心疾首者。我國今日。尚在勇於私鬭而怯於公忿之狀態中耳。希望今後非國民之公意。對内絶對不許枉費一槍彈。對外必要不許吝惜一槍彈。我國民其猛省。我國民其亟起</p>

<h3>王曉籟演說救災問題</h3>
<p>王曉籟昨在ＸＢＣＬ播间臺演說救災問題、演辭如下、諸位、今天曉籟在這裏關於水災的事情、有幾點要向在座諸君貢獻一下、古語說得好、「人事關於下、天變應於上、」這幾句話、並不是迷信的話、並不是說人們得罪了天、天纔降了許多災害、這是說什麽水災旱災、人們事前如果有了相當的防備、什麽大水、什麽大旱、就不會演成事實、就使成爲事實、亦不致於整千整萬的災民、活活的淹死餓死、所以我國有句古話、呌做「人定勝天」這句話、就是我們現在戰勝任何困難的一句格言所說的是目前水災問題現全國遭災的地方有十七省的廣、占全國土地三分之一、災民有七千萬之多、占全國人口六分之一、已成爲極嚴重的一種局勢、但是全國同胞們要記得吾國歷史上、有幾段古事、呌做帝堯的時候、有七年的大水、成湯的時候、有九年的大旱、但是那時的百姓呢、倒没有些什麽大不了的苦痛、這是什麽緣故呢、就因爲事前能夠預防、事後有了相當的補救、諸位試想那個時候、科學没有發達、交通也没有現在的便利、尚能做到這個地步、所以我們現在對於偌大的水災、不怕没有辦法、但怕全國没有被災的同胞們、不能下一個絶大的决心、有持久的努力、現在就各處報紙、翻開來一看、對於籌振這件事、可謂十分盡力了、有政府的救濟、有團體的提倡、有報館的宣傳、商界的營業提成、個人的節衣縮食、這是我們辦振的人、不能不表示萬分感謝的、但是今年的災况這樣的大、災民這樣的多、恐不是捱過三秋一冬、災民就可以過活的、也許這樣的振務、要辦理一年吧、所以現在助振的人們、又有一個持久的計畫、要將個人收入詳細考慮一下、如果這個人每月將他的收入提出十分之一、或二十分之一、來儲蓄的、頂好就把一年裏頭儲蓄暫時停止、移做按月振濟災民的用、如果向來没有儲蓄的、那末一個人的交際費·捲烟等·消耗費·或多或少、總是免不了的、就把一年裏頭這種交際費·消耗費·暫時停止、移做按月振濟災民的用、那末這個振務辦下去、就不致於青黄不接了、這一層是對全國没有被災的同胞說的話、還有呢、就是要籌劃災區的善後這一會包括的範圍、可是很大了、第一水災與旱災截然不同、水勢一退之後、農民如要播種來年的麥子就要資本、商家要恢復以前的營業、不特是以前存留的貨物多被水漂去了、再要進貨、那裏來的資本、况且還有到期的債務、要逼緊來的呢、辦理振務、已是千頭萬緒、說起災區的善後、那更是煩複極了、但是我們如果怕他麻煩、不想一個災區善後的辦法、那末這個振務不知辦理到何年何月、方纔得了、所以曉續有一個主張、到期將債務應仿照日本當年大地震的辦法、由各處商業團體配量當地情形、商量一個各方兼顧展期償還的妥善辦法、商店復業的資本、那是要靠銀錢業援助的了、但是被災地方的銀錢業、受了這般水災極大的創痕、恐怕也没有多大的力量罷、所以這件事不能不希望災區外的銀錢業、對於災區内的銀錢業、盡一些相當的援助還有農民補種冬麥的資本、曉　以爲應當採取兩種辦法、第一種是就振欵裏面提出幾成、專做這件事的用、第二層、就政府發行的振災公債提出一千萬或五百萬、就災區内設立農民銀行、貸欵農民、就把農民的土地、做借欵的擔保、這一層是希望全國商家大家起來、想個辦法還有呢、就是食糧接濟問題、東北的餘糧、可以補助我們災區民食、這是誰都知道的、前幾天商會、亦有這樣的一個電報、打給政府、但是還有一般人在詳細考慮、以爲東北的餘糧、照東北的財力、能不能分年付欵賒給我們呢、其實這是不成問題的、盡現在的水勢一退以後、照曉籟方纔說法、能夠使他們復業以後、至少總有兩千萬人、不消政府按名發給口糧、就怕今年田畝無收、没有食糧可買、所以我敢說東北的餘糧、一半是爲接濟這班人用的、還有一兩千萬人、如果非按名發給口糧、自已實在没有購買的力量、那末就照七日時事新報雷殷君所說的話、由吉黑兩省官銀號先將麥價粉價、墊付一下、再由政府一半用現欵歸償、一半開振災債劵抵付、並非辦不通的事、這件事希望振災團體、大家起來主張、最後的一句話、就要說到水利問題了、其實現在所說的、還不是水利問題、乃是一個防水問題、這次的水災、旁的地方、且不去說他、單就揚州裏下河而論、據當地黨部的宣布、民衆團體的聲訴、均說防險的材料、事前没有充分的準備、出事的時候呢、防河的人員、又大家一走了事、所以這件事、實在要歸咎於人謀的不臧、正應了古語所說人事關於下、天變應於上、一句詁哩、嘵籟記得、前清光緒年間、鄭州黄河决口、用了一千三百餘萬銀子、方纔合龍、這個時候、全國　收入、每年不過七千萬、所用於水災的經費、整不多占了全年收入五分之一、足見當能重視河防的情形了、還有一層、前清對於河防的失事人員、處分是非常嚴厲的、我們可從當時的東華錄及私家文集中、那時所謂河道總督、如果在他的區域、出了重大的水災、重一點就要革職充軍、輕一點就要枷號河干示衆、以方面大員、受了枷號示衆處罰、其懲儆溺職人員的作用、亦實在不在革職充軍的下、所以前清的政治、雖是腐敗、這種地方、確是值得我們注意的、曉籟覺得此後防水工程比什麽都要緊、但是有兩個前提、第一須有充分的經費、第二對於河防人員、須隨時有嚴格的考核、使這班人不致以我們老百姓性命爲兒戯、這件事要大家起來、對於政府有一個相當的建議、曉籟要說的話、都說完了、不過這一次、並不是普通的慈善的救災、是救國家救民族的救災、請大家一致起來、以顯一顯我中國愛同胞愛國家愛民族的血心、</p>

<h3>沈賡耀君訊（問救國對日方法。）</h3>
<p>國難到了、我們應如何救中國、是目前一個很嚴重而急切的問題、下列數點、笥明敎、（一）我國民處現在地位、對日本應取何種態度、（二）（略）（三）在現在危急存亡關頭的中國、何以國人仍抱着麻木不仁的態度、（四）現在因爲感情的激動、欲替國家效力的人、當然很多、敢問怎樣纔算效力國家、服務社會、像我現在做一個商店學徒、可算是服務社會嗎、</p>
<p>（覆）吾們稍有知識稍有血性的國民對這回空前的日本加於我東北的暴行、自然没有一個不是怒髮衝冠、顧和日本拚命、不過一時的情感和意氣、是不中用的、這一肚子悲憤、奮發、激昻、熱烈的精神、必須用沈着而鎭定的思想、精密而持久的組織和計劃、把他鎔鍊起來、團結起來、擴大起來、向着有效的方面進行、怎樣才有效呢、總得大家預備着犧牲、不過吾們要犧牲在有價值有效力的動作上、就吾們國民的地位所能做的說出來、</p>
<p>第一、要把自己的身體練好起來纔配說到犧牲兩字、每人須各個的鍛鍊、還須受公共的訓練、無論農工商學機關、均須設法使有集團訓練的機會、在没有集團訓練的機會時先自約集同志、定期操練、</p>
<p>第二、下一個大决心不用日貨、吾們不要說八次抵制日貨、一次没有收效、請看英國國力總算厲害的了、印度一甘地、能使他們軟化、甘地究有多大本領呢、最厲害的、就是提倡不用英貨、尤其衆目昭彰的他身上穿了印度的土布、在印度的總督衙門、英國的首相衙門裏、踱出踱進、現在日本呢、單講棉布一項的價值、在外國輸入總額中、要占百分之七十、差不多要二萬萬元、在中國境内日本紗布廠的出品、差不多又要二萬萬元、吾們若是全國一致不去買他、就這一項、已足制他們的死命、何况同時各種都不用呢、從前抵制所以無效、就是没有從羣衆身上養力、儘管高唱抵制、没有一個肯做甘地、吾們現在人人决心做甘地、還怕無效嗎、</p>
<p>第三要大大注意研究東北問題、日本問題、地圖呀、書籍呀、報章雜誌呀、凡關於東北的、應該儘量收集、用心研究、九十二歲老人馬相伯先生說、「要救中國、先救東北、要救東北、先知東北」</p>
<p>至於君現在職務、豈但直接是服務社會、而且間接還是效力國家、因爲要强國必先富國、努力增進生産開發社會經濟、簡直是救國根本大計、在現在抗日救國的時期、吾們還應該加倍努力你看德國大戰以後、工人自動的每日增加工作一小時、所以恢復國力這樣快、第四條是不成問題的、</p>
<p>但是第二問、不是應該這麽說的妱果有人這樣說、你該嚴切的糾正他、你說國人麻木不仁、也未必確、請看這幾天各地方民氣多麽發揚、所以第三條也不成問題的、</p>
<h3>申報讀者通訊簡章</h3>
<p>本報同人深信讀者諸君各有若干切身的問題、急待商决、同人根據服務社會的精神、願以顧問的地位、本極誠懇的意思、試爲文字上之商榷、萬一讀者因此而獲得適當的解决、减免多少困難、增進多少幸福、豈勝快慰、</p>
<p>一凡欲與本報同人通訊商榷的問題、暫以求學·職業·婚姻·三項爲限、</p>

<h3>血染的諾貝爾奬金</h3>
<p>諾貝爾奬金NobelPrize是什麽？這在學術界裏是没有人不知道的。牠的價值是每獎四萬美金。每年發五奬，是二十萬美金。這五個奬金是贈與一年中在物理學，化學，生理學·或醫藥學，文學，與世界和平上最有貢獻的人。這奬金是八百四十萬元美金所生之利息而這八百四十萬元却是諾貝爾一生製造猛炸藥與無烟火藥所賺來的錢。</p>
<p>諾貝爾AlfredBernhardNobel，瑞典人，生於一八三三年死於一八九六年。他從十七歲即帮助他父親製造硝化甘油，Nitroglycerin。硝化甘油桶是用沙裝的。七年後，一天偶然有些硝化甘油漏在沙裏，結果給了他一個非常的暗示，他屢經試騐，最後用百分之二五矽藻土Kieselguhr和百分之七五硝化甘油造成猛炸藥Dynamite。這是一八六七年的事。後來他又用軟木代替矽藻土，效力格外安穩。過了幾年他用膠棉Collodion傅裏傷痕。膠棉是棉花火藥Guncotton溶化在醚裏的産生物。他偶然將瓶裏没有用了的餘液倒在硝化甘油裏，那令人驚訝的炸裂膠BlastingGelatin便因此於一八七六年出世了。這便是世人所稱之雙料炸藥。他先後發明炸藥許多種，連軍用無烟火藥在内，得專賣特許權一二九種。他那八百四十萬元美金便是從這裏來的。</p>
<p>他起先製造炸藥之動機無非是爲開擴採石之用；後來爲政府所誘惑，諾貝爾亦不惜屈科學家之尊嚴爲軍人造殺人之凶器。和平奬金之建立乃是諾貝爾晩年懺悔之表示。放下屠刀，立地成佛，我們對於他這念頭之一轉，當然要表示相當的敬重。但是當年所殺之人已不是今日所救之人，而今日所救之人，誰又敢說不是將來所殺之人。在科學家的手裏實掌握着人類之生殺權。用科學養人不用科學殺人，纔是科學家之天職。若存着一個殺人的心去學科學，那便是世界上最大的惡人。諾貝爾的懺侮，彰彰在人耳目。他那每年一次的血染的奬金不啻爲青年科學家之暮鼓晨鐘，何能充耳不聞？如果一雙眼睛只對着那四萬元金洋，豈不是無聊之至嗎？</p>
<h3>一淂之言</h3>

<p>假使一個人有了健康的身體。和保證事業成功的秘訣。他一定會變成一個不知喜怒哀樂的蠢才。</p>
<p>人之智慧。並不以經騐之富澀爲衡。而以其求得經騐之能力高下爲斷。</p>
<p>經騐之取得。純以學問爲背景。經騐爲成功之母。學問爲成功之父。缺一不可。</p>
<p>世俗所稱之偉大。即爲宗敎上所稱之神聖。二者均爲可望而不可即的東西。</p>
<p>男女初戀。是好奇心與愚蠢之結合。</p>
<p>人生是什麽。不過是將自己的靈魂不斷地切了開來。去調換各種不值錢的東西而已。</p>

<p>邇來我國科學管理之聲。甚囂塵上。良以産消兩方。非此俱不足以言經濟。最近本埠中華職業敎育社因鑒於社會之需要。乃有工商管理科之創辦。日前特請前清華大學校長曹雲祥先生蒞校演講「人事管理問題」。至理妙喻。發揮盡致。予以其語頗足供社會之參考。爰記之如下。</p>
<p>自國民政府頒布實行工廠法後。一般資本家。咸大起恐慌。蓋有感於自身學識之不足。乃亟思羅致人才以爲助。今日諸君之所學習者。可謂適其所需。他日畢業而後。出路便利。當可不言而喻。惟今日所欲爲諸君告者。則爲亟待解决之各項實際問題。例如予友戴君所服務之某銀行。曾於五六月前。忽有一女職員屢請病假。久出不歸。繼經該行人事管理股某君疊加考察。漸明眞相。蓋某女士之家庭。甚屬簡單。同居者止有一老母。年將花甲。一姊則早已適人。女士因念已身之尚無歸宿。不覺有老母誰依之感。抑鬱之極。遂爾致病、病則慰藉紛至。精神上反覺愉快。某調查員旣知其詳。遂禀命該行長囑令其母。時伴伊往各處游覽。藉解煩悶。果未久而病痊復職。仍勤奮如故云。由是觀之。有人之道。可不加之意乎。</p>
<h3>災民工作之我見</h3>

<h3>誌「無聲之音」作者</h3>
<p>— 徐心芹</p>
<p>法文學者魯意。賴魯阿先生。研東方文語學有年。於我國古籍。喜涉獵古哲老莊淮南之說。而於我國古樂及戲曲。尤富研究興趣。曾迻譯國劇及著述「中國音樂」一書。膾炙歐西人口。一九一四年在荷蘭出版之「通報」上發表「淮南子與音樂一文」。實發中西人士之所未發。於是中西治漢學者。羣相驚愕。近頃賴氏銜法政府之命來華考察文化及古樂。臨行時撰「無聲之音」（東訪神州古樂前序）一文。刋登巴黎新時代報。極致其欽慕我國古文化之熱忱。昨因最近返國之藝術家劉海粟先生及文藝批評家傅雷先生之介。得與賴氏相見於李石曾先生别墅中。當時特由禇民谊先生李先生令姪等邀集名流蔡子民先生高魯先生。及中法在滬學術界鉅子等四十餘人。同臨茶話。并請國樂家鄭覲文先生及大同樂會國立音專敎授等奏大套古樂。以誌歡迎賴氏之忱。暢聆旣畢。又獲拜讀賴氏大作「無聲之音」。夕陽在山。人影散亂。鄭君後奏古寒二關。初夜寂寥。萬籟無聲。至樂感人。思潮起後。援筆書後。聊寓所懷。茲將錄賴氏大作如下。</p>
<h3>無聲之音（東訪神州古樂前序）</h3>
<p>— 法國魯意賴魯阿作</p>
<p>此乃無音之音之時也。於知音者適爲至美之音。吾人爲市聲所震。神役夫物。急思一眼清凉散。公元前二世紀時。羅馬與加太越之戰方終。尚未及征服高盧之時。漢室宗親淮南王劉安。嘗有箴言「視於無形則得其所見矣。聽於無聲則得其所聞矣。至味不慊。至言不文。至樂不知。至音不呌。···」又云「聽有音之音者聲。聽無音之音者聰。不聲不聰。與神明通」。其論調雖異。精神則一。「琴不鳴而二十五絃各以其聲應。軸不連而三十輻各以其力旋。絃有緩急小大。然後成曲。車有勞逸動靜。而後能致遠。使有聲者乃無聲者也。能致千里者乃不動者也。」所謂琴者乃今中國至高之樂器也。十七世紀時有琴法。輕攏慢撚之指法外。兼且攝養心神之訣。蓋手腕之敏捷。固不足致意境之清明高遠也。「心亂則手撓。手撓則琴不靜。非寂寞隱士澄明寗定之志無以致靜。心遠塵俗。手自安間。焚香者留其清馨而驅其氣。烹茶者取其醇醪而去其馥郁。欲求清音。亦當洗滌胸襟解除塵慾。指　掃却一切塵俗氣。弦上自清靈幽絶矣。予此次長途遠行。即擬東訪此迄今尚存之古樂。予當日讀聖賢之書。沉思冥想。修身養氣。庶幾彼邦人士之不我遐棄也乎。治水之道。盡力澮洫。使能順性。各得其所。是其消納之途。宜其廣也。至於工商兩界。需人固多。而在三千人中。自必百工具備。各有一長。曩予在軍政兩界服務時常見軍官獄官。一切工作需人時。無不能在軍中獄中。立時選出人材。大如建築工程。自土木五金以至漆匠。往往齊備。小如裁縫廚役浣婦花農。亦皆可以咄嗟立致。甚至抄胥文士畫匠手民醫卜星相之流。亦有混跡其中。然則此三千人衆。豈必除眠食而外。無他技耶。故吾甚願有官辦之職業介紹所。迅速實行。宣告成立。大登廣告。且不限於災民。任人皆許登記。則人材集衆。供求相應。失業恐慌。亦得救濟其有益。於社會民生。正非淺鮮。實跂望之。（移酬助賑</p>

<h3>丈夫的妻子（廿一）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>李夫人心理，早已有這樣的思想，但是伊没有向人說過，也没有聽見别人說過；陳先生這樣的論調，李夫人覺得是一種至理名言，伊感動得像受了電氣的震動一般，對於陳先生，是佩服極了。但是伊自從和陳先生認識了以後，從來不曾贊過一句話，恭維更是没有的事。伊還想用不相干的話去駁他，試探他對於自己的見解，是不是眞實的信任，因爲伊在疑心他，也許對人而發，在引動伊的心，使伊心悦誠服做他的好朋友。</p>
<p>「這不能一概而論，義務的對面，是權利，你怎麽忘了？試問夫婦間没有相互的權利麽？有時一方面情願犧牲權利而只盡義務，那還有什麽爭執呢？你不能只拿我們來作例子，我們的例子，不一定是普篇的啊。」李夫人精神好了，很高興的故意和他辯駁。</p>
<p>「朋友們盡義務，大概是有限度，有時間性，惟有夫婦的權利與義務，是絶對没有限度與時間性，所以極容易發生疲懈而怨望。但是照我的意思，權利與義務，就是一種商業上的交易性質，惟有情感，是一種精神的維繫，所以無所謂義務與權利，夫妻是如此，朋友也是如此，譬如你剛才給我整理衣服，我並不曾要求你，但是你自動而願意的做了；你對我並没有一定要整理這衣服的義務，但是我已享到權利了；在你做的時候，也並不希望我怎樣答酬你，但是我已感謝你了；我不必一定把感謝你的意思，放在嘴上講給你聽，但是你也並不因此而不高興，這便是因爲朋友的關係，是知己的關係。假使我的妻子在前面，我要求伊給我整理衣服，伊做了，我覺得這是伊的義務，我的權利；要是伊不做，我便覺伊不盡義務，或者伊討厭我責備我，不應該這樣多享權利，那便要發生不快之感，也許會因此而發生爭執了。所以我說還是朋友，比較的可以相互的諒解。我因想得比較透澈一些，所以對我的妻子，並不怎樣約束伊，也不禁止伊和男朋友交際，我以爲越是夫婦，越没有意思。假使盡了義務，而情願犧牲權利，已是含有怨恨的成分；要自己犧牲了而並不知道犧牲，才是一件偉大。」陳先生像學者演講人生哲學般的剖析給李夫人聽，這種見解，在他妻子面前，從來也不曾講過，因爲他覺得妻子的程度，還談不到這樣話，只有李夫人，他才認爲可以細談，所以爽實的講了。</p>
<p>李夫人當然是一個聰明者，伊很佩服他的口才，覺得比普通的情話，還要濃郁得有甜味，伊恨不曾在未嫁時遇着他，伊恨自己的命運，只遇到了李先生，伊幻想伊自己，假使有了陳先生這樣一個丈夫，是如何的幸福；現在他這樣說，也許他也是怨恨自己不曾早和我相遇呢。伊想到這裏，只淺淺地笑。微微地點頭。</p>
<p>「這辯論會你得了錦標，我已失敗了。」李夫人坐了起來，用手把鬢邊的秀髮掠往耳後，顯露出白膩的兩顎，眞是美極了。</p>

<p>昨（二十二日）華商證券交易所市場情形、期市以外交關係、人心混亂、價有巨大變化、賈買成交極熱閙、大戶進出了結、零戶交易、均甚踴躍、而投機買賣、亦殊見興奮、市面緊張如前、計前市晨初一盤交易即達一千六七百萬、次盤亦未稍平、下午以場帳簽查未竣、延至五時始開拍、至現市則依然寥落、債價因人心不定、市場求供形勢、瞬息萬變、價亦隨而升沉莫測、仍有極大波瀾方於晨初開出時、以買氣甚盛、如裁兵·編遣等、比前飛躍二三元之巨、旋爲市上有巨額售出、一瀉而下、自後時漲時落、其趨勢備極混亂、而其傾向、則一致趨低、計上午收市價、比前日停拍時均小數角至一元餘不等、蓋賈勢普遍、雖有大戶補進、及金融業方面之收購、賣方在市上終佔優勢也、後市情形略異、買氣忽大旺、各價步步向堅、如統税鹽税等、比上午漲高一元至一元六七角、市上一時頗見樂觀、非復前之緊張矣、結果較前日除二○關統税遠期漲達一元七八角編遣二○　亦大一元數角外、裁兵十月則跌二元一角、其他互有漲跌、上落殊參差也、計期貨交易上午共約三千萬、後市亦有一千五六百萬、合計約有四千六百萬元、爲額之巨、則又超過上週最高之紀錄矣、</p>

<h3>紗市飛速高騰</h3>
<p>紗市大漲、形勢堅挺、以對日有經濟絶交說盛、於是人心大振、而某巨商大批扒空、致市氣愈趨愈緊、同時本紗生意益覺起色、但海外狀况依然虚弱、故有一部份仍抛買、日商大數空頭、商塲上多數預料美棉有轉機之望、所以買氣又濃、漲風愈激云、</p>

<h3>棉市漲風驟起</h3>
<p>被紗市帶高</p>
<p>棉市被紗市帶漲、但美棉仍疲、英印棉市轉漲、商塲上多數預料、明日美棉有大漲風、而金價始跌後漲、故市勢平定、獲利者大批扒空、形勢遂緊俏、然外棉售價依然廉宜、目前世界金融旣陷紛亂之中、而國步又如此荆棘、所以有一部份仍抱逢漲抛出之意、前途情形、仍乏把握也、</p>

<p>糧食新洋杜尖跌三四角</p>
<p>南頭昨各帮米船、到積稍有、城鄉店銷、因北市步削、胃納乂淡、况洋米到積漸厚、客銷不振、人心向下、故成交依然平淡、厚粳行情受勒二角、視勢節前恐難轉機、早晩稻寗胃擯塞、本街亦呆、致價跟修近角新杜洋尖、到貨略有、惟走銷因北市不划而呆鈍、所去亦勒價而已、行情竟甩三四角、變陰元貨稀胃淡、市亦疲、</p>
<p>新閘昨到船不多、約十念號、本街走銷平而且懈、北粳高宿二檔、回落近角、買氣極懈、人心看疲、洋米受金市影響、陳薄破到頭雖少、去路平平、價無漲跌、新洋尖·新蘆尖·新參尖等貨、各低三四角、變元明跌暗定、早稻隨到隨銷、市盤續挺、河廠各貨、斛脚三千石左右、</p>
<h3>期洋米突跌二三錢</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、因人心浮動、行情均見疲軟、現貨較定、期貨更被金價影響、洋商均願貶價抛售、回籠貨先受影響、小絞米九·十月份竟突跌二三錢、計開九月份小絞二百噸、價祗五兩七錢、又十月份五兩六錢、計四百五十噸、現貨開小絞二百包、價十二元三角、西貢一百包、價十四元一角、客元則有汕頭帮辦去贛元三百包、價十四元二角九分至十四元云</p>
<h3>標粉稍軟而已</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、午開盤後、各月份市面、曾見一度之衝動、以洋麥雖互有上落、芝加哥小二三角、坎羣大漲五六角、惟大條暴長、金市發生巨大之跌價、故一部份人心、頗形虚軟、本月份最低至二兩零五分半、十月份至二兩零五分、十一十二月份至二兩零六分、一月份至二兩零七分半、二月份至二兩零八分二釐半、較前日收價、計落一二分不等、惟以後各盤、又復漸佳、因多數空頭、均乘機抵進、致欲墜之市面、反見撑住、迨至下午、復逐開逐好、傳與某廠接近之大空戶、依然急抵不已、所以人心陡震、買氣甚旺、但以環境言、仍覺未許樂觀、因匯率放長、洋麥仍可續定、聞俄麥前日又定開四船、合價祗三兩六錢半、雖日本之暴行、未能解决、但與國外之定貨、當然尚無問題也、結果九·十月份較前日跌一分二釐半、十一月份跌一分半、十二月份至二月份跌一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥市起伏不定</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、因金價之暴落、不免影響人心、故本月份最低至三兩七錢二分、十月份至七錢四分、十一月份至七錢七分、十二月份至八錢一分、一月份至八錢半、二月份至九錢、較前日跌去二三分不等、惟空氣雖不佳、大戶空頭、均思乘此軟檔、急急抵進、至欲跌而不跌、各盤之跌勢、反見無幾也、迨至下午開盤、本月份仍然平穩、遠期因大戶空頭、接續暢補、各月份開價、又較上午略好、照此種景象、似須略呈穩挺、但過分高昂後仍須防洋麥之抛壓也、結果本月份較前日小一分、十月至十二月份好二分、一月份好三分、二月份小一分五金</p>
<h3>青鉛因定價升漲而提加</h3>
<p>五金市面、邇因日兵蹂躪我東省、致該地附近之各埠、莫不來電停止辦貨、所以全市益覺清淡、長江一帶、雖水患較前略輕、但地方仍不安寗、故亦無有採者、是以市面之賴以點綴者、僅間浙蘇魯諸客帮耳、惟時近秋節、該帮等亦少添購、故市况頗覺清淡也、平白鐵英美諸貨、雖略有開出、惟爲數不多、故市無上落、白鐵瓦二十八號英貨、昨日走銷較好、價售十六兩二錢半、英鋼板半分七厘半、烟台鎭江諸帮昨辦去四百餘担、價半分六兩五錢、七厘半六兩一錢半、青鉛本埠交易、爲數無多、惟海外定價暴漲二金鎊、致本埠售盤亦高起二三錢、計售十五兩八錢、點錫昨市雖海外亦見升騰但本埠市面尚無上進之勢、此外馬口鐵·新鉛絲·黑鐵皮等雖略有開出、但市無升降云、</p>

<h3>法將福煦</h3>
<p>歐戰日記顧昻若譯</p>
<p>砲擊三小時之後、法蘭特集團軍便於九月廿八日上午五點三十分在狄思莫特和雷斯河之間開始進攻、一戰大捷、德軍第一道防綫完全攻下、第二綫大爲動摇、</p>
<p>翌晨、我到法蘭特、往加塞爾訪普勒美軍長、到拉朋内覲見比王、再至賀塘看紀倫少將、我敦促他們速向洛勒和陶洛挺進、軍心並不懈怠、廿九日、狄思莫特克復、拜興台爾山嶺以及梅新内韋希特要邑相繼陷落、兩天之内、擒獲俘虜一萬人、大砲二百尊、</p>
<p>卅日、繼續進展、但因天雨行軍稍緩、惟英第二軍已逼近美寗、進至雷斯河左岩、</p>
<p>十月一二兩日、下令暫停前進、以便與後方聨絡後重新加緊猛撲、</p>
<p>戰區行軍困難、經過的地方到處盡是彈穴、满满的積存着泥水、後方、頁石爾河右岸的交通好幾處早已隔絶、火綫裏的兵士有幾處已無從接濟食物和軍火、祗有暫用飛機輸送食糧如欲使護送隊可以行動、首須澈底修理交通路綫、有幾處須用高架築路長至數哩、</p>
<p>行軍固屬困難、然而我軍在法蘭特的戰績早已顯著、德軍懼於法蘭特集團軍在雷斯河北面進展、和英軍在桑斯河南面同時遂進遂在英第五軍（軍長波特胡）之前退却英第五軍在英第二軍右翼作戰、且與第一軍取得聨絡、（未完）</p>

<h3>我們的企望</h3>
<p>— 敬齋</p>
<p>我們丨丨菁莪劇社此次的所以要應路市展覽會之約而來公演「一片愛國心」之意義、可以很簡單地說、是有兩點、第一、固然是要想盡我們一點有限得很的微力、來爲我們蒙災同胞請命、俾能得一些實惠、以及精神上的安慰丨丨實物的救濟、而尤其重要的、就是第二點、我至忱地要想憑了我們青年所可貴的僅有的一般沸騰着的熱血、來喚醒我們那般麻木不靈、還是睡在鼓裏的同胞們的靈感來、</p>
<p>我們還記得在「新時代」週刋的第一期上、曾發表了一篇「我們的經過」的文字、在這篇文字中、一方面固然是表明了我們的經過和我們的組織的概略、同時也把我們的目標和我們的態度都給說明了、我們曾說過這幾句話來、戲劇是可以諷剌人生的、調劑人生的、又可以象徵人生、表現人生的、更可以指導人生的、此外、我又曾在六月二十日的本欄内的「看了說謊者之後」的一文裏、更明白地說過、「我們知道劇社運動的意義和使命、不僅是只在技巧方面的成熟、就算了事的、其最大而且最重要的意義、還是在它能夠激發一種社會的效果來、所以在這裏、凡是我們努力於戲劇運動的同志們、都得要知道我們的成功、是在多方面的、是要含有個中心意識的、致於表情的吻合佳妙、劇情的曲折深奧、這到還是個次要的問題哩、」關於這兩點、前者、可以說是我們對於戲劇底眞義之認識、後者可以說是我們努力於戲劇運動的鵠的、這個、一直自我們開始工作以至於最近的現在、都是被我們認爲是合理、尤其是在這個年頭兒丨丨天災人禍、内憂外侮交迫雜來的時分、更要被我們認爲我們的認識和我們所走的道兒是正確的、是並没有差、</p>
<p>但我們都只是一般没有實力而僅有一腔熱血和赤忱的青年、所以我們耳聞目覩着那整千成萬的苦臉呻吟的蒙災同胞、私那一片驚心觸目、染满了我們的同胞由强鄰的砲火剌刀之下而流出來的熱血的國土、我們是在怎樣地痛心和憤怒·喲、</p>
<p>然而也許因爲我們的民族、因所受的剌激傷痛、太深而且太大的原故吧、所以一般的人們、都好似已經失去了感覺般的麻痺着了、或許是根本因爲我們大中華民族的民族自强的意識、是已經消失了他、要不然、那麽爲什麽在這個天災外侮交迫之下、我們還誰也不肯振奮起來、抛棄了一切的已見、大家共衷共濟地來在這個我全民族的存亡生死、在此一舉之際、用個必死的願心、來爭自己民族的生存與滋長呢、</p>
<p>我們因這個不斷的内亂、使我們想起了那囚首垢面、哀號呼援的十三省的被災同胞、又因那囚首垢面、哀號呼援的十三省的被災同胞的黑影、使我們又想起了那鮮心殷然的幾千百里的大好國土的被佔、更因這個鮮血殷然的幾千百里的大好國土之被佔的傷痛、更不禁使我們聨想起了在「一片愛國心」一劇中的幾句話來、秋子是個嫁與中國人做妻子的日本婦人、好因了好自己的民族、國家的利益、就不惜强迫自己最親愛的丈夫和兒子來做賣國賊、亡國、奴原因、好說是「我愛我的日本、」同時、我們那兩位做丈夫和兒子的同胞、雖然在這個極苦惱的積威壓迫之下、但終給我們也聽到一句如獅吼般的反抗的呼聲、</p>
<p>（我愛我的中國、）</p>
<p>於此、我們就可以得個新的認識和覺悟、我們可以知道在這個雖親愛如夫婦母子之間、尚不免因自己的國家民族上的利害關係而會發生出那不可避免的衝突、那麽如那種僅在口頭上、白紙上的「維持東亞和平、」「同文同種、」以及那「中日親善」的陳語爛調、是還值得我們拿來迷信和崇仰嗎、看喲、東三省是我們中華民國的領土、但現在是被强暴的日人、强吞汚剥了、我們該是醒悟的時候了、我們該把我們那個淹淹一息、行將垂斃的民族之魂扶持起來啊、我們都該反抗地呼道、</p>
<p>（我們愛我們的中國、）</p>
<p>哦、我們想到此地、那單頭攅動囚首垢面、哀號呼援的被災同胞的黑影、和那血肉糢糊的一片焦土的慘狀、又復浮現到我們的眼簾中來了、我們心痛、我們憤怒、我們不知道我們將怎樣地來獻身、呵、我們是只有奉獻給諸位以鮮紅的血、赤熱的心、企禱着諸位同胞、都能從今起、也存一個「我愛我的中國」的决心、並希望全體拿出實力來、救濟我們被災的同胞、和對抗整那個的中華民族的敵人　日本、</p>
<h3>秋來了</h3>
<p>— 霍彪</p>
<p>星期六的晩上、偉到我的寓所裏來、他近來顯然是清瞿得多了、雖然我們不時還可以在他的臉容上找得一絲絲天眞的微笑、但畢竟馬上就飄逸了、而且往往、遠遠天、再也不能抓住、這一月來、我們倆似乎各爲某一種需要的追求而投機了許多、過往日漸由疏而密、這樣言談的親熱、在當初連我們自已眞也料想不到我們的友誼會有如此的進展、今晩、他捉住了很興奮的神態、但見他氣喘吁吁、兩頰帶了些醉意、一種不自然的情緒、反映了他心湖上掀起的波紋、</p>
<p>「龍、我們到公園裏散散步去吧、」他一跨進門就這樣說、「房間裏太悶了、舒暢不得我的心、」</p>
<p>「怎麽、」我對於他的急急的態度是不無疑慮、「你好像非常興奮的樣子、可又受了什麽新的襲擊、傷感的、是在認眞着吧、」</p>
<p>「没有什麽認眞、我的朋友、還是到公園裏去談吧、」</p>
<p>他拉了我的手、於是我們踽踽地行着、公園離我的寓所是不到百步路的、但約摸化去有一刻的光景、一路上我們聆着秋蟬的悲鳴、突然、偉握緊了我的手、說、</p>
<p>「朋友、秋來了啊、音調悽厲的、若有無限深意、</p>
<p>「哦······」我一時簡直把話塞住了、彷彿我的靈魂上受了一個猛烈的促醒、　　我不能知道我的朋友怎麽會說起「秋來了」這問題的、我更不知道一種共鳴的哀思如何會佔有了我們的空氣的、我想着、我摸索着······</p>
<p>「嗽」的一聲、在我們的跟前停落了數片枯黄的樹葉、我們相對的痴笑了一番、一切盡包含在不言中、</p>
<p>進了園門、不上幾步偉就對着眼簾前的景色說、</p>
<p>「唉、蕭條之神、不上幾天、面目就改換了嗎、火熱的温情、就消失了嗎、」</p>
<p>「不錯、」我不覺脱出了口、「這便是　　秋的權威呀、」</p>
<p>我們掠過了些疏淡的人影、避過了些散落的熱閙、揀了一處幽關的高墩地方坐下、</p>
<p>偉的神色起着變化的現象、眞似萬般心事叢伏地在他的心底、但我們都是在怕着去開口、無謂的寂寞活躍在我們的四週、很慚愧、我們竟不能立刻破除相互間的隔閡、</p>
<p>我漫望着無邊的天際、我遥瞰着幢幢的樹影、我併息着想說、然而某一種幢幢的侵襲、無形中又想說而止了、今夜、我爲偉勾逗了好久未曾温理的傷痕、然而終於不能保持沉默的持續了、偉用着一種懺悔的口氣說、「我不能讓她離開了我的、好雖開了我、我的生命就没有光、没有希望······」</p>
<p>「那是去年的秋天、」他停了一回後又繼續的說、一也是這樣的一個晩上、我發現了她給另一個男子引誘去了、於是我懊喪到不可形容、接連害了一塲病、我把佔有她的心死了、從此以後、我也不想再見好、我們就此永遠給隔絶了、但是、我到死、終是愛着好的啊、好的髮、她的笑窩、好的温柔、好的全部的輪廓······」他說得像表演戲劇的口吻、</p>
<p>「但自此以後」、他又連着說、「我生活的趣味就减少了、唉、我將怎樣去放置我的愛情、現在秋又來了、我那裏能夠獲得安靜、」</p>
<p>我聽了他從苦悶中激發出來的言詞、不知是同情他、是悲自己的身世、我偷偷的拭着涙、然而我不能像他這樣爽直地說出這是猶如嘔血呢、</p>
<p>「所以我對於這秋風的來降」、他又說了、「我祇有想到逃避、這情境、眞不能使你安定下去、一切的生活就給維繫在矛盾的旋機上了」、</p>
<p>「朋友、我們就客觀一些吧、」我極力鎭定了下來、「女子是······、追求她、祗有給你投到痛苦的深淵去的路」、</p>
<p>「然而··············」我們就一輩子放棄女人了、······」</p>
<p>「當然不是這樣說的」、我辯解着、「但與其同不懂愛情的女人談戀愛、我覺得是寗願拒絶的好」、</p>
<p>「············」</p>
<p>「············」</p>
<p>「凉風颯颯地吹過來、我們不覺長期的沉默、又似沉醉、又似深深的厭惡着、</p>

<h3>統計法概論</h3>
<p>— 叔淵</p>
<p>著述者丨丨丨丨許炳漢</p>
<p>統計學或爲一種獨立科學而爲一般人所公認爲重要之學問者、不過是近五十年間的事體、本書之主要目的、在於叙論現代所用的統計方法、給學者以一種可依據的規矩、全書分四編十七章、</p>
<p>在第一章裏是叙述統計學的略史、在紀元三千五十年以前、埃及爲建造金字塔、而有戶口及財富的編製、降而在紀元前四千四百年、蘭母土第二（ＲamesesＩＩ）爲蠲除土地不均平的弊端、重行分配起見、乃有埃及土地統計表的編製、這就是統計學的嚆矢、當時編製統計表的目的、在於協助政府行政上的便利、以及作戰的策略、所以計算的都是租税、土地分配、兵士人數等的普通材料、直到重商時代（merchantilisticPerild）統計學遂呈長足之進步、因當時政府崇拜金錢主義、一面要奬勵本國的工商業、一面就不得不求出口超過入口、應此需要而生之種種法規、勢不得不賴精確的統計、以决其立法的方針、所以統計學益覺見重於當時、自此以往、歷時愈久、而統計表的範圍也愈加擴大、到了最近三四十年間、統計表的編製、更爲精詳、近代列强各國、差不多都有統計局的設立、美國的國立統計局（notionalBureaulfStatistic）就是一個例、</p>
<p>在這章裏把近代統計學界分爲兩大類、一是方法統計學（Statistioalmethod）、一是應用統計學（AppliedStatistics）、所謂方法統計學、不僅注意於特殊方法的研究、而且注意於一般法（Laus）規（Ｒules）及方法（Mothods）的製造、應用統計學者、就是以方法學家所造成的法則及公式、應用於現有具體的事實上面、又可分爲科學的、記述的、像美國的戶口統計、不但將全國各地在某時間的人民與富源、一一比較、又與幾十年前的人口與富源、互相比較、這是記述統記最善的一例、科學的統計常用記載過去的材料、以建設一定的物理的或心理的定律、</p>
<p>在第二章裏叙述的是統計學的定義、對於許多專家所下的定義、按集在一起、詳爲參證、最後確定含義較廣的定義如下、統計學者、從計算之分析、或估計之集合、所得之結果、而判斷自然的或社會的集合現象之方法者也、</p>
<p>在第三章裏叙述的是統計學的功用、特色及其材料、統計的功用、非特對於政治家事業家、極有價值、即理論經濟學家與科學調查家、也須用統計、以爲其理論或假定之證明、是故生物學家以此而證明變化與遺傳之定率、經濟學家以此而立人口、工資、物價之定則、或表示各羣不同現象間之因果關係、例如金融恐慌與失業之關係、社會學家以此證明犯罪、貧窮、自殺與其他有關之現象之關係、此種都是統計科學的功用、至於統計學的特色、在於此簡馭繁之作用、一羣内各項事物、可以不經一一歷數之繁瑣、即能予吾人以準確的觀念、例如調查本國工人的平均工資、無須統計個個工人的工作、若能求得幾個模範例子而得其平均數、就可知其大概、搜集統計材料、約有數種方法、一爲親自搜集法、調查者親自調查、可以確知調查之情形、且係一手造成、更可得準確的利益、此種方法、大都適用於自然科學、間亦有用於社會學與經濟學之調查、還有一種方法、就是由調查、者雇用許多紀錄員或通信員、而集合彼輩計算或估量之結果、或者由統計家集合各私統計家之計算或估量之結果而比較之、加以審查、而得最後之結果、惟應用此種方法、所得之統計、不甚精確所以大部份關於經濟學或社會學方面的數字研究工作、均必有賴於政府的報告表、因爲祗有政府對於全國人民之活動、始有資力與意志以搜集眞確之統計、還有政府統計、可施權力强迫人民報告、個人則不能、此又政府統計優於私人統計之點、</p>
<p>在第四章裏叙述的都是解决實際上的問題、如定問題之範圍、問題因數之選擇、這些都是對於統計上極關重要的、</p>
<p>在第五章裏專門叙述統計單位（Statisticalunit）統計學常不能離開數字、而數字必先定單位、而最後决定之單位、一定要與單位之名稱相符合、有時名詞不能十分確定、則對於此單位、必須下一嚴確的定義、選擇統計單位、不特定義要正確、且其性質必爲可以估量者、凡抽象之事物、宜以具體語詞表示之、以便於估量、</p>
<p>在第六章叙述的是關於統計材料的設計及搜集、在這裏告訴我們、統計工作有一種特點、即每事必須預先熟慮、錯誤之起源、須預爲之防、大概之結果、須預爲估計、凡問題·因數·單位·設向·表格·記錄員·製表·工作方法·時間·費用等等、都是應該預先周詳考慮的問題、至於搜集材料的方法、大概普通所用的是下列四種、（一）親自調查、（二）通信員之推算、（三）表格由被問人塡寫之、（四）表格由記錄員處理之、此四法中、宜用何者爲適當、則當視問題之性質、以及欲求結果之準確與所有經費之多寡以爲斷、</p>
<p>第七章與第八章都是討論統計之準確問題、依據各種數學的演算可得可能的準確、</p>
<p>第九章是討論材料搜集以後第一個分析問題丨製表、關於表之標題、表之式樣、都有很詳細的指示、</p>
<p>第十章是講圖式之功用、表中數字、雖能整齊不紊、然不便於記憶或比較、統計學之主要目的、原使繁多之數字、清晰明白、令人一閱即知、欲達此目的、因有補充或解釋之方法、圖解就是最通用的一法、</p>
<p>第十一章是講次數表之功用與分類、吾人研究各種昌然現象、發見各組均有各組的特性、因此有分組研究之方法、而所造之表即稱爲次數表、</p>
<p>第十二章到第十四章都是叙述各種計數方法之缺點與優點、裏面有許多算式、可據以得精確的結果、</p>
<p>統計學重要之部分、在於各時期現象之比較、比較之方法甚多、在第十五章裏就是叙述歷史的統計、分爲（一）絶對數字表、（二）絶對的歷史統計圖、（三）對數的統計表、（四）對數的歷史統計圖、（五）指數、（六）指數的歷史統計圖、</p>
<p>第十六章是叙述比較之各種方法、一切統計學上研究之最後目的、在於比較、所謂比較、就是表明事物在時間上及空間上之關係、使吾人對之有明確之觀念、對於比較上各種圖表之畫法、均有極精確的數字的說明、</p>
<p>末了一章是講相互關係、意即在二種連續系數或二羣事物間有某種原因關係存在之謂、相互關係、可分爲相同的相互關係與相反的相互關係、在這章裏有許多表格、都是很精確的、</p>
<p>在這本書裏、除叙述統計學史外、凡關於統計學之初淺方法、對於簡單統計材料之研究或造表所必不可少者、都有極詳盡的討論、其他分析比較各種方法、也包羅無遺、我敢說一句、這本書爲實用統計家丨尤其在社會科學方面丨很好的參考書、在書末還有許多圖表、也都是很精確而難得的、</p>

<h3>Japan Advances on Harbin</h3>
<p>Japanese troops occupy the Siping-Taonan Railway, penetrating deep into northern Liaoning province. The League of Nations Council demands the withdrawal of Japanese troops to their original defenses. The Russian Foreign Minister declares that they cannot remain passive regarding the Manchurian situation. The Central Government issues a call to the nation's compatriots for unity, composure, diligence, and perseverance.</p>
<p>Japan continues to occupy Chinese territory in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. All Japanese troops from Changchun have departed for Harbin. A detachment has been sent to occupy Liaoyuan (Zhengjiatun), taking over the Siping-Taonan Railway. The Soviet Union, considering the Japanese invasion of the Chinese Eastern Railway, believes it cannot stand idly by. Military intervention to protect the railway is likely to materialize. China's representative to the League of Nations, Shi Zhaoji, reported the Japanese invasion to the Council. The British representative expressed sympathy, considering it a matter involving the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Council resolved to authorize the Chairman to issue urgent notices to both China and Japan, demanding the withdrawal of Japanese troops to their original defenses and sending personnel to Manchuria for on-site investigation. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<h3>Tense Situation in Harbin</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Advance on Harbin</p>
<p>Harbin Merchants Organize Self-Defense Corps</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles received a telegram from Harbin stating that while order is maintained, the atmosphere is extremely tense. The Japanese consulate warned Chinese officials not to allow any anti-Japanese actions. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese troops from the Duomen Division and the Railway Garrison in Changchun departed for Harbin on the morning of the 22nd. On the evening of the 21st, several large bombs, believed to be planted by Japanese, were discovered in Harbin. Japanese troops invading along the South Manchuria Railway and Antung-Mukden Railway lines have been provoking Russia in recent days. Harbin is extremely worried that Soviet intervention to protect the railway is imminent. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Rumors are rampant in Harbin. The Chief Executive's office held another meeting this afternoon to discuss measures to maintain public order. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Harbin merchants organized a merchant corps to arm for self-defense. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army denied sending troops to Harbin. However, all newspapers received telegrams stating that the Japanese military authorities in Changchun decided to send troops to Harbin. It is also reported that troops from Shenyang and Dalian have already departed for Harbin. This suggests that the military authorities acted on their own responsibility without waiting for a Cabinet decision. The Cabinet has firmly refused to send more troops to Manchuria, arguing that the number of Japanese troops in Manchuria, including those who arrived in Shenyang from Korea yesterday, is already sufficient according to the treaty. They fear that sending more troops would easily be interpreted as intending to wage war, which would be detrimental to a future resolution. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that part of the Second Division, which occupied Jilin yesterday, has been ordered by Commander-in-Chief Honjo of the Kwantung Army to proceed to Harbin. It is also reported that the Japanese army intends to occupy the Chinese Eastern Railway west of the South Manchuria Railway, as well as Taonan and Sipingjie. If so, the Japanese army will occupy 150,000 square miles of Manchuria, bordering the Songhua River in the north, Korea in the southeast, and the Great Wall in the southwest. If the Japanese army occupies Harbin, it will inevitably involve the status of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and problems will arise in relations between Japan and Russia. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese army has occupied the entire Siping-Taonan line to Zhengjiatun and Jilin province. They intend to go north to Harbin. The [missing information] Unit departed from Shenyang this morning to go to Harbin. The [missing information] Unit followed after, departing from Shenyang at 3 PM to head north. (Dentsu dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Kuanchengtzu Station</p>
<h3>Chinese and Russian Railway Personnel Flee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The junction of the South Manchuria Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway at Kuanchengtzu has been occupied by Japanese troops. Chinese and Russian personnel of the Eastern Railway have fled. All residents of the city are also fleeing. The Kuanchengtzu telegraph office was bombarded by Japanese troops, and several employees were killed by the shelling. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Russian Consul in Harbin Protests to Japan</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in Changchun</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Russian Consul in Harbin visited the Japanese Consul today to protest the stationing of Japanese troops at Changchun station. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The headquarters of the Japanese Second Division have moved to Changchun. Division Commander Duomen arrived in Changchun on the morning of the 20th. The South Manchuria Railway Headquarters has been established at the East Station in Changchun. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Changchun airfield, which was rapidly built by the Japanese army, has been completed. Yesterday at 3 PM, reconnaissance planes departing from Shenyang arrived in Changchun at 6 PM. (Dentsu dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Soviet Union Expresses</p>
<h3>Inability to Stand Idly By Regarding the Manchuria Case</h3>
<p>Officially Notified Both China and Japan</p>
<p>Chairman of the War Committee Flies to the Far East</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Deputy Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee officially notified the Japanese Ambassador and the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires today that the Soviet government can no longer be a disinterested observer of the conflict in Manchuria. Chairman Voroshilov of the War Committee has flown to the Far East. (National Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) External news: Sending troops to the border and dispatching multiple aircraft is for patrolling the Chinese Eastern Railway. There are rumors that Russia and Japan are at war in Jiandao. Foreign sources say they have not heard of such a thing. As for whether Japan agreed in advance with Russia to divide North and South Manchuria, this cannot be proven. It can be concluded that Russia's dispatch of troops to the border is for self-defense. It is not an invasion of the Chinese Eastern Railway, nor is it to monitor the Japanese. Some say that Russia is sending troops to help China, which is also not true. Foreigners who have received telegrams from Moscow say that Stalin, upon hearing of the Japanese invasion of Liaoning and Jilin, stated that he would maintain a neutral stance and that China is still in a state of severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russia will not take advantage of the situation and will only protect the safety of Russians on the Chinese Eastern Railway. The troops will not enter Chinese territory for the time being. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Occupy Liaoyuan City</p>
<h3>Preparing to Advance to Tongliao</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Sipingjie, at 6 AM on the 22nd, two armored trains of Japanese troops, fully loaded with rifles and artillery, arrived at Zhengjiatun via the Siping-Taonan Railway, preparing to advance to Tongliao County. The situation on the Dalian-Tongliao road is tense. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 11 AM today, a Japanese regiment attacked Liaoyuan County. Our troops withdrew in compliance with orders. The Japanese army entered the city at 11:30 AM. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) News reports from Changchun state that a detachment of Japanese soldiers has been ordered to proceed to Sipingjie to protect Japanese residents in Zhengjiatun. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Burn and Plunder Jilin</p>
<h3>Attacked the City with Artillery for a Day and Night Before Capturing It</h3>
<p>The 56th Regiment Garrison Sacrificed</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Harbin, Jilin's telegraph and telephone lines were cut off by Japanese troops on the 19th, and the city was attacked. Brigade Commander Li Guilin of the 23rd, without orders from superiors, did not surrender the city. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack with two divisions, with artillery fire non-stop day and night. The city fell at 3 PM on the 21st. The entire 56th Regiment was sacrificed. Officials and civilians died in droves. Burning and looting continued on the 22nd. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a foreign telegram, when Japanese troops entered Jilin city last night, street battles occurred with Chinese troops. 60 Japanese soldiers were killed, and 105 Chinese soldiers were killed. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Harbin) After Jilin was occupied by Japanese troops, key figures of the provincial government retreated to Panshi to work. The city is still maintained by our police, but under the command of the Japanese brigade headquarters. However, they have changed into Japanese police uniforms. The Japanese army established a maintenance committee in Jilin, with seven Chinese members and eight Japanese members, under the command of the brigade headquarters, to maintain public order. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese troops occupied Jilin provincial city at 5:50 PM yesterday, with little resistance. Chinese soldiers, seeing a large Japanese force advancing along the Jilin-Changchun Railway, abandoned the city and retreated. The Japanese army distributed leaflets from airplanes before occupying the city. The Jilin-Changchun Railway is now under the control of the Japanese army and is operating as usual. The Ministry of the Army announced the number of Japanese casualties in Manchuria: 65 soldiers killed, 93 wounded, 3 officers killed, and 7 wounded. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) According to refugees arriving in Tianjin, when the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, our army did not resist from beginning to end, and there were many casualties. In order to confuse the world's views and perceptions, the Japanese specially fabricated evidence by destroying the Liuhe small bridge on the South Manchuria Railway and moving many corpses of Chinese soldiers killed in Shenyang to the side of the bridge, taking photos to show that the provocation was started by us. However, the bridge usually has Japanese soldier guard posts and is heavily guarded. This fabrication of evidence exposes their conspiracy and they immediately built a new road to allow traffic.

<h3>Discussing the Manchurian Incident</h3>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Detailed the Japanese Military Aggression</p>
<p>Fangze Tried Hard to Request Delay but Failed</p>
<p>The British Representative Believed It Involved the Kellogg-Briand Pact</p>
<p>The Discussion Should Be Notified to the American Government</p>
<p>The Council Decided to Authorize the Chairman</p>
<p>To Send Emergency Notices to the Two Countries</p>
<p>Demanding That the Japanese Troops Withdraw to Their Original Defenses</p>
<p>Dispatching Commissioners to Manchuria for Investigation</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese representative Minister Shi Zhaoji officially applied to the League of Nations today to intervene in the Manchurian incident. The League of Nations Council, in response to Minister Shi's request, convened a special council. Minister Shi's petition was submitted to the special council. The situation in Manchuria is serious. This incident has a huge impact on the prestige and status of the League of Nations. When Chairman Spanish Foreign Minister Le Le announced the meeting and invited the Chinese representative to submit the petition, the League of Nations hall was extremely crowded. Minister Shi immediately stood up and read aloud many official telegrams from the Nanjing government, detailing the Japanese military aggression, and said that the area of ​​Chinese territory that had been ravaged by the Japanese military was as large as the British Isles. Minister Shi continued, saying that the Japanese military's ambition to occupy so much Chinese territory is still in full swing, and the situation is undoubtedly becoming more and more dangerous. If the Japanese military's aggression is not restrained, China can only invoke other clauses of the League of Nations Covenant to make further appeals. Finally, Minister Shi hoped that the League of Nations would uphold justice and intervene, which would surely stop the Japanese military's atrocities, restore the pre-war state, and guarantee that China would receive compensation for all losses suffered by the Japanese military's military actions. Japanese representative Fangze then took the floor and tried hard to defend himself, firmly claiming that the number of Japanese troops in Manchuria was less than that of the Chinese army. According to the information sent from his own government, the conflict was caused by the provocation of Chinese soldiers. Fangze continued, saying that China's request for compensation was "simply inconceivable" because the responsibility for this matter lies with China and not with Japan. Fangze further questioned what right China had to appeal to the League of Nations under Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant. He firmly claimed that this was inadmissible and that the conflict could only be resolved locally after a detailed study of the local situation. The Japanese government's intention is that this dispute is only related to China and Japan. The Japanese government has done its best to make it a local incident. In order to avoid the expansion of the conflict, the Japanese government advocates that direct negotiations between the two countries concerned are the best way. Finally, Fangze said that he has not yet received specific instructions from his government, so he cannot express his attitude on China's request for the League of Nations to intervene. For this reason, he requested the Council to postpone the discussion of this entire issue until the next meeting. Minister Shi stood up and replied, firmly claiming that his report was completely true and that the League of Nations could organize a special investigation committee to clarify the truth. If the committee can conduct a fair investigation, China is optimistic about its early organization. Regarding Japan's insistence on direct negotiations, no country in the world would accept the humiliating condition of having its territory occupied. Direct negotiations can only be held after the pre-war state is restored. The Chinese representative further stated that the League of Nations undoubtedly has the power to intervene in this matter. Finally, Minister Shi said that Fangze's statement that Japan did not recognize this conflict as an act of war was welcome, but the Council must pay attention to the fact that the war in the Far East is imminent. If the international community does not decisively and resolutely take steps to reverse it as soon as possible, there will inevitably be a point where it will be irreversible. Fangze then reiterated his previous request, earnestly hoping to adjourn the meeting first to wait for his receipt of specific instructions before discussing it again. The result seems to have failed, as the discussion was still ongoing at 1 PM. (National Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) In the middle of the war of words between the Chinese and Japanese representatives, British representative Xue Xier suddenly stood up to participate in the discussion. He first said that the League of Nations is now in a position where it cannot resolve the issue of who is at fault. Then he asked the chairman to cite precedents and apply to the governments of China and Japan to prevent the expansion of the situation, while vigorously urging Japan to withdraw its troops invading Manchuria. Xue Xier finally declared that we must recognize that this issue has transcended the League of Nations and involves the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Pacific Four-Power Treaty. The United States is also a signatory country, so it is also very concerned about this issue. Because the United States is also concerned about this matter, I propose that we notify the United States of the entire discussion of the Council on this issue, so that the Washington government fully understands our steps. (National News Agency Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council adjourned at 3 PM in the afternoon. The Council authorized Chairman Le Le to issue an emergency notice to the governments of China and Japan, requesting them to avoid expanding the situation, and demanding that Japan immediately withdraw its troops to their original places and restore the pre-war state. The Council also decided to send a committee to Manchuria for investigation after British Chief Representative Xue Xier stopped the eloquence of the Chinese and Japanese representatives. (National News Agency Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the conflict between China and Japan, no resolution has been reached by the League of Nations today, but British representative Xue Xier strongly advocated during the debate that the troops should immediately withdraw to their original defenses in order to prevent the situation from becoming more serious. The Administrative Council discussed this matter for two hours. The documents submitted by the Chinese and Japanese representatives contradicted each other on many important points. Xue Xier said that the events currently happening in Manchuria are something that any country should avoid. He asked both China and Japan to avoid them. The Administrative Council has not yet fully understood the cause and extent of the conflict, but it believes that while investigating the cases of both parties, the troops should return to their original stationed locations. Xue Xier continued to mention international treaties related to the United States, and cited the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Washington Treaty. He concluded by saying that the minutes of the Administrative Council's proceedings should be notified to the United States. The Japanese representative suggested that this matter should be resolved through direct negotiations between China and Japan. The Administrative Council then adjourned for private discussions. After half an hour, it reconvened. The chairman declared that non-public discussions had failed to enable him to propose a resolution on the Manchurian issue. It was scheduled to reconvene at 3:30 PM. It is widely believed that the Administrative Council will advocate sending military attachés to investigate the current situation caused by the Japanese military's actions. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations personnel here today acknowledge that China's request for the Council to intervene in the Manchurian incident will allow the League of Nations to test its ability to quell wars. The Council will convene tomorrow to consider China's petition. Representatives from various countries are paying close attention. The Chinese government's petition to the League of Nations is worded very seriously, requesting the Council to immediately prevent the expansion of the situation in order to avoid endangering the peace of various countries, and ordering the Japanese army to withdraw from the occupied territories, and then determining the compensation that China should receive. The document details the Japanese army's violence and declares that the Chinese military and civilians have never resisted it. It is expected that the League of Nations Council will immediately ask the authorities of China and Japan to each order their troops to withdraw to locations where it is not easy to have conflicts, and organize a commission composed of diplomatic and military representatives from the Far East to investigate the truth on the ground. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Politicians from various countries gathered here are quite worried upon hearing that Japan has expressed its unwillingness for third parties to interfere in its military actions in South Manchuria. Generally, people feel that the prestige of the League of Nations is now in danger. If China invokes the Kellogg-Briand Pact to petition the League of Nations Council to act as a mediator, what should be done? However, it is heard that the League of Nations is driven by moral obligations and must take action, even if it causes Japan's resentment. As for the nature of the actions that the League of Nations is preparing to take, it is still very vague. The Chinese delegation has issued a statement tonight, stating that Minister Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, will formally request the League of Nations to arbitrate the South Manchurian incident tomorrow. The difficulty of the League of Nations' position can be seen in this telegram. (National, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shi Zhaoji delivered China's petition to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations at 10 AM on the 22nd, requesting three points: (1) Emergency motion to immediately stop Japanese military action and limit the expansion of the incident; (2) Restore the original state before the incident occurred; (3) Retain all damage compensation. The League of Nations has formally received China's petition. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Compatriots, Quickly Awaken and Rise Up</h3>
<p>Today, the Central Government issued a nationwide order to mourn for the compatriots in our Northeast who were brutally killed by the Japanese military and to commemorate the national humiliation. I</p>
<p>Our country's people today stand under the half-lowered flag fluttering in the crisp autumn wind. Silently ponder the destruction of our great rivers and mountains, and silently ponder the current crisis of our nation. As warm-blooded men, you should be heartbroken and weep, and as warm-blooded men, you should bravely rise up.</p>
<p>Today's affairs: Crying is not enough to save the country, rash actions are not enough to save the country, and waiting for help is even less enough to save the country. Saving the country lies in active and effective actions, and in the unity of all people.</p>
<p>The race is declining and the mountains and rivers are broken. All our compatriots in the country should cry out in unison. If you don't cry now, what else is there to cry about? However, shedding all the blood and tears will not wash away the shame of our country and our nation today, and will not make up for the current great disaster. If reason has not been obliterated, if mankind has not died out, we hope that the world will effectively restrain this act of taking advantage of people's difficulties. However, waiting for someone to save you is ultimately a possibility that is difficult to realize. Justice is often in the hands of the strong. Who is willing to come forward and speak out for justice? Therefore, today's affairs can be decided with one sentence: only self-help can save oneself, and only struggle can lead to survival. Retreating is suicide, that is, waiting for destruction. The ambitions of the Japanese will not stop until they include our country and destroy our nation. The atrocities in Shenyang, the attacks in Jilin, killing our soldiers and civilians, occupying our land. We have already resisted and retreated. However, the Japanese atrocities have not diminished slightly, but have intensified. If we retreat to Shanhaiguan, the Japanese will also press to Shanhaiguan. Suppose we retreat to Beijing, retreat to Shanghai, retreat to Nanjing, and the Japanese still advance step by step. Will we continue to retreat without resisting? Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters sent a telegram to the Central Government, saying, "Even if we try our best to retreat, there must be a limit to the retreat. Even if we are willing to be slaughtered, we should choose the method of slaughter." The words are extremely painful. Fighting to death is death, and waiting to die is also death. Which one is better? We should choose for ourselves. The alliance under the city can be done once, but not again. If we follow the old ways and sit idly by without taking the initiative, will we allow the civilized ancient country and the great mountains and rivers to be destroyed by our hands today? We have already complied with the spirit and creed of the Pact of Paris first. Only self-defense can save oneself, and only warm blood can wash away shame. Our country is at a time when it can no longer tolerate or allow any concession, and should strive to resist violence and seek self-defense. In other words, it should make a back-to-the-wall battle for self-defense for the sake of defending the country and defending the nation.</p>
<p>The people of the whole country should, in the face of this great disaster, follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of "peaceful struggle", adopt a calm attitude, have the determination to die, eliminate internal disputes and resist foreign aggression, and avoid rash actions and useless sacrifices. But if everyone has this awareness and determination, when the bugle sounds, they can rise up at any time to serve the country. At this time, all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce should intensify their work to prepare for contingencies. As for the youth, the lifeline of the country is at stake, and the responsibility on their shoulders is even more arduous. At this time, they should thoroughly awaken, rise up and struggle, actively temper their body and mind, strengthen their will, read without forgetting to save the country, and save the country without forgetting to read. They should learn from the spirit of the emerging nations of Germany, Turkey, and the Soviet Union, endure hardships and hone themselves, make effective struggles, make proper sacrifices, and make permanent persistence.</p>
<p>The situation is critical and disaster is imminent. Fortune and misfortune, survival and death, are determined today. Natural disasters and foreign enemies can all destroy us. If we want to not be destroyed, we can only save ourselves. Napoleon once said, "There is a giant in the East who is fast asleep. Let him sleep, because when he wakes up, he can immediately shake the whole world." Today's severe natural disasters and foreign troubles are the alarm bells to wake up our nation's dream. With our country's vast land and abundant resources and people, if we resolutely rise up, what shame cannot be washed away, and what disaster cannot be eliminated? The current situation is not to be feared or lamented. But it is necessary to awaken, unite, and fight together.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Central Announcement</h3>
<p>A Message to Our Compatriots Throughout the Nation</p>
<p>Achieve True Unity</p>
<p>Remain Steadfast and Calm</p>
<p>Work with Redoubled Effort</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In light of Japan's sudden violent occupation of our Northeastern territories, the Central Government, recognizing the shared national crisis facing all compatriots, issues the following message to the nation: Japan, taking advantage of our internal strife, compounded by sudden natural disasters causing death, displacement, and overwhelming relief efforts, has launched a violent invasion. On the 19th, they forcibly seized Shenyang, and since then, crucial areas of Liaoning and Jilin have been ravaged. Their acts of aggression continue unabated. Such barbaric conduct is not only prohibited by international laws and treaties, but also constitutes an unprecedented occurrence in world history. Our nation suffers unparalleled humiliation, and our people endure immense aggression. All those with a sense of honor are filled with outrage. Our Party, adhering to the teachings of the late Premier, revolted to save the nation. The Central Government, in fulfilling its duty, will make its utmost effort to avert this unprecedented crisis. We firmly believe that justice has not been extinguished and that aggression will be restrained. We are also confident that our compatriots, fueled by righteous indignation, are prepared to perish rather than surrender. When the final, necessary moment arrives, they will shed their last drop of blood to defend our national integrity and the survival of our people. We wish to convey to all our compatriots throughout the nation that, facing this extraordinary event, the nation must rely on the united strength of all its people. It is especially crucial to identify a common path forward. Saving the nation and resisting foreign aggression is the most arduous and critical task in the world. Precisely because it is critical, we must not treat it lightly. Precisely because it is arduous, we must execute it with a highly robust organization. Our nation has suffered years of hardship, and its strength is insufficient, leading to danger and humiliation. This situation does not arise from a single cause. The most prominent factor is the lack of discipline in collective action. This current foreign invasion is unprecedented in its severity. To ensure that justice prevails and aggression is curbed, we must act in unison, proceed in step, heed unified command, and maintain strict discipline. Only then can we generate comprehensive strength to achieve concrete results. Under these principles, we wish to point out the following matters to our compatriots: (1) We must achieve true unity. We must recognize that the paramount task at hand is to save the nation, and completing this task is of utmost importance. Under the grand principle of safeguarding national interests, we must strictly avoid antagonism based on class, region, or even differing views and emotions. All actions in the world are based on unity. Those who fight individually against a formidable enemy will surely fail. Those who engage in mutual recrimination during a major crisis will surely perish. Therefore, all words and actions must genuinely maintain national unity. (2) We must remain steadfast and calm. We must recognize that the responsibility upon our shoulders is extremely grave. A precarious situation cannot be reversed by empty slogans or by impulsive emotional outbursts. Therefore, we must refine our fervent emotions into unwavering strength. We must be prepared to make sacrifices at all times. All matters must be executed with established order, and we must strictly avoid boastfulness. We must be aware that others despise us for our weakness and timidity; therefore, we must strive for resoluteness. Aware that others hope for internal strife, we must be cautious of treacherous schemes. (3) We must work with redoubled effort. Whether it is the nation or the individual, we must dedicate ourselves to hard work and intensify our efforts. Amidst coping with the crisis, we must cultivate the foundations of the nation. We must recognize that the effort to ensure national survival cannot cease for a moment. At this moment, we must deeply reflect on the reasons for our nation's weakness. Therefore, on one hand, the government must continue to exert effort in suppressing bandits and providing disaster relief. On the other hand, our people, whether farmers, workers, merchants, or students, must not neglect their respective duties for even a moment. Only when the entire nation profoundly understands and genuinely prepares to make sacrifices at any time can the national crisis be resolved. Otherwise, disarray will not contribute to saving the nation, and losses will only benefit the enemy. The above three points are guiding principles for our entire nation to abide by. With the crisis at hand, we can no longer afford to hesitate or slacken. We earnestly hope that we will maintain unwavering resolve, uphold firm discipline, and be prepared to die. We must engage in sustained struggle, saving the nation is saving ourselves, defending against aggression is defending our homeland. Turning misfortune into fortune depends on the efforts of our entire nation. Let us strive together. (Special Dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Beijing City Convenes</p>
<h3>City-Wide Party Member Congress</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Delivers a Solemn Speech</p>
<p>Do Not Allow Spirits to Wane; Avoid Frivolous Actions</p>
<p>Temporarily Endure with Patience; Prepare for Final Resolve</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese military's occupation of our Eastern Provinces has ignited nationwide outrage. The entire body of Party members in Beijing held a city-wide Party member congress at the Central Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 22nd, with over six thousand attendees. All were filled with indignation and vowed to avenge this humiliation. Members of the Central Committee present included Chiang Kai-shek, Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Bulei, Zhang Daofan, Yu Jingtang, Fang Juehui, and others. The atmosphere throughout was unusually tense, and order was maintained. After Chairman Chen Haicheng reported the purpose of the meeting, it was followed by a report from Chairman Chiang as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Circumstances of the Nanjing City-Wide Party Member Congress</p>
<p>The abrupt military action taken by Japan in our three Northeastern provinces, forcibly occupying our Shenyang, Changchun, Andong, Yingkou, and other crucial areas of Liaoning Province, is unprecedented in the international arena. Our nation has suffered a humiliating and grievous insult. All comrades and compatriots must deeply recognize this, rise up in unity, and save our nation from peril. Moreover, it is especially important to study the context of this issue from a broad perspective to grasp the true situation and devise a response. This Japanese act of aggression not only undermines peace in the Far East but also threatens world peace, and the situation is extremely grave. Therefore, we must firmly resolve to respond with steadfastness. In my opinion, this Japanese act of aggression can be seen as a test of the following two points:</p>
<p>(1) A test of whether there is justice or fairness in the international community and whether the nations of the world are determined to curb tyranny and ensure world peace. This Japanese action not only exploits our vulnerability and violates international morality but also gravely undermines the spirit of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Both of these treaties were established by various nations to ensure world peace, and I firmly believe that all members of the League of Nations and signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact will appropriately judge Japan's act of aggression in violation of these treaties.</p>
<p>(2) This incident can test whether our nation can unite and unleash a spirit of patriotism to resist foreign aggression. I recall that the Japanese have a book titled "The Escalation of the Manchurian Problem," which roughly describes the Chinese people as being disunited and indifferent to national affairs. It suggests that the Chinese people outside the war zone during the Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion seemed unconcerned. The people of the South were bystanders to events in the North, and the people of the North were also unconcerned about events in the South. This is the general idea of the book. Therefore, Japan dares to openly invade because it truly regards our people as insignificant. This is deeply regrettable. Whether our nation can unite as a whole, with the entire country of one mind, and unleash a genuine spirit of patriotism to save the nation from this grave national crisis is also a significant test. I firmly believe that all our people, recognizing the fundamental importance of this day for the survival of our nation, will rise up in unison and save our nation from peril, thereby thwarting Japan's ambitions and proving its observation wrong. However, when a major event occurs in the nation, the spirit of the people must not be allowed to wane or become disorganized. In particular, actions must avoid frivolity. Strength is born from organization. We must act in unison, proceed in step, maintain strict discipline, obey unified command, and be of one mind and one heart in engaging in a fight to the death. Only then can we generate effectiveness. We must never act alone and fall into disunity. Now that Japanese aggression has occurred, it has been five days. The Central Government has conducted careful study and decided on the steps to be taken. At this time, world opinion has generally recognized that Japan is being unreasonable. Our people must, at this moment, be united, place justice against power, and use peace to counter barbarism. We must endure the pain, suppress our anger, and temporarily adopt an attitude of enduring with patience while awaiting the judgment of international justice. All our comrades, adhering to the Three Principles of the People, should revolutionize and save the nation and should have the resolve to disregard life and death to preserve the survival of our people. However, the survival of the nation is of paramount importance. At this time, we must urge the people to strictly abide by order, obey the government, respect discipline, and avoid reckless actions outside the bounds, instead engaging in a well-ordered and methodical struggle. To endure with patience for the moment is by no means to surrender. If international treaties and trust are rendered ineffective, and peace becomes hopeless, reaching the point where endurance is unbearable and should not be endured, then the Central Government has made its final determination and final preparations. At that time, it will surely lead the entire nation, preferring to be shattered like jade, and use the strength of four hundred million people to defend the survival of our nation and the integrity of our country. I have dedicated myself to the revolution, placing life and death aside long ago. At this moment of crisis and survival, I will surely exist with the nation and perish with the nation. I will stand at the forefront of the people as their vanguard, sharing the national crisis and fulfilling my duty. I hope that all comrades will understand this intention and widely convey it to our people. (Special Dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

The Moscow Party newspaper stated that Manchuria was originally a place of contention for the rights and interests of England, America, Russia, and Japan. This time, Japan's solo invasion may trigger a major war. The world has already seen the effects of war treaties and the League of Nations.

After the bill was passed on its third reading, it was sent to the House of Lords, where it was proposed by Foreign Secretary Reading and passed completely in two minutes. Shortly thereafter, it was submitted to the British monarch for approval. Since the Labor Party did not oppose the bill, and the Liberal Party held a meeting today originally intended to draft a free trade declaration, it instead issued a statement declaring its willingness to support the National Government's efforts to maintain British credit. These two events show that various parties want to set aside party differences and jointly relieve national difficulties. When Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden proposed the motion, he said that the plan would not hinder the freedom of the city of London, nor would it hinder the movement of cash deposited in the Bank of England by other governments or banks. The British government still has an obligation to repay cash (referring to US dollar loans) in accordance with the loan terms. The governments of the United States and France have expressed their intention to support British credit, and the British government is very grateful for this. Some foreign debtors of British debts are currently unable to pay due to their own domestic financial situation, and there are reports that the debts owed by the Bank of England to France and the United States are about to expire, and the recent debts of France and the United States will be used up. Therefore, the government has no choice but to make this decision. The British people have not engaged in the export of funds. The government intends to work with foreign banks in London to find ways to prevent the sale of cash, and intends to consider a plan to levy on foreign bonds owned by the people to form a reserve that can be used to maintain the British currency when necessary. They have tested foreign opinions and learned that they do not currently welcome an international conference to seek cooperation from the central banks of various countries, but the British government strongly supports this move and will continue to state the necessity of this move. The internal position of the United Kingdom is currently stable and should maintain its position. Our move may have a serious impact abroad, but it is only temporary. Anyone who trusts the British currency will never regret misusing their trust. The United Kingdom believes that other creditor countries should recognize their responsibility for creating this situation. It hopes that the current turmoil may pave the way for international cooperation. Although the impact of the current situation on countries that rely on London is at least as serious as that on the United Kingdom, international credit institutions may be temporarily disrupted, but the British currency will still be a medium of international credit. If British finances are handled carefully, it does not see any reason for the British currency to fall in the long term. The British government is implementing this plan not to adopt a soaring policy, but to prevent the British currency from falling.</p>

<h3>Official Telegrams</h3>
<p>A telegram from Zhejiang Provincial No. 1 Middle School, declaring and forwarding to the Guangdong comrades of the Nanjing Central Government and all schools and organizations across the country for their consideration: Starting from 10:00 PM last night, Japan suddenly occupied Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, Huludao, Qinhuangdao, Jilin Provincial City, Changtu, Kuanchengzi, Jiandao, and Nanling with heavy troops, killing countless of our soldiers and civilians, capturing our military and government leaders, burning our institutions and schools, destroying our arsenals, seizing our radio stations, and destroying all transportation facilities in the eastern provinces. Their cruelty and tyranny are enraging both humans and gods. They are now advancing towards Yantai and Longkou, provoking everywhere, clearly intending to take advantage of our natural and man-made disasters to plot against our entire country. The life and death of our compatriots hang by a thread. It is hoped that all will rise up in armed resistance, jointly face the national crisis, quickly cease internal strife, and unite to resist Japan, so that China will not immediately sink, and the final calamity can be averted together. This urgent telegram is sent with tears and utmost anticipation. Signed, Zhejiang Provincial No. 1 Middle School, 588 teachers and students.</p>
<p>A telegram from Nanjing to all newspapers for their public review: Having just read Vice Commander Zhang's telegram echoing the Japanese, and various other telegrams, we are shocked to learn that the Japanese army invaded and occupied Shenyang, Andong, Yingkou, Changchun, and other places on the 18th and 19th of this month. Internal disasters have not ended, and external troubles suddenly arise. Facing such difficult times, with the threat of national demise imminent, if we wish to save China from sinking and extend the lifeline of the nation, there is no other way than to unite our efforts, concentrate our strength, unite as one, and endure hardship. We dare to implore comrades from all sides, compatriots across the country, to deeply consider the difficult times, eliminate prejudices, defend our territory, temporarily put aside the petty anger of brotherly strife, and jointly resist the external insults that are close at hand. Then, even if we are as few as three households to overthrow the Qin dynasty, or ten years to revive Yue after its subjugation, it would not be too late. Otherwise, we will all perish together. If the internal disputes do not cease, the great calamity of destruction will be upon us. In times of crisis, we must help each other. With tears in our eyes, we offer these words and await your wise guidance. Signed, Military Counselors Gao Weiyue, Jin Handing, Wei Yisan, Li Jingxi, Tan Qinglin, Zhan Xuchu, Ye Kaixin, Cao Wanshun, Zhang Ke Yao, Zhu Shigui, Yang Chisheng, Sun Bowen, Ma Jidi, Zhu Gaoru, Ma Xuhang, Zhang Jinde, Yi Deqin, Feng Huatang, Councilor Song Bangyi, Lin Zhuotian, Bao Bin, Wang Shiying, Wu Wenfu, Jin Shaowei, Yang Qingfu, Zhu Hailing, Wang Zhenbang, Liu Haishan, She Yufang, Liu Zan Zhou.</p>
<p>A telegram from the Nanjing Social Education Federation to the Shen Bao, forwarded to all social education institutions nationwide for their public review: The Japanese army has suddenly occupied Liaoning and Jilin, dividing their troops to seize territory, taking advantage of our natural disasters, and acting with violence. They have violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and destroyed East Asian peace. The bad news has spread, and all those with blood and qi are filled with anger. We, the social education comrades, bear the heavy responsibility of awakening the masses. From this day forward, we must urgently change our peacetime work plans, concentrate our strength, and engage in work against Japan. On one hand, we must do our best to awaken the masses, making them aware that national demise is imminent, and that they should unite as one, support the government, and embrace the determination to rather die than be enslaved, and jointly face the national crisis. On the other hand, we must strive for international publicity, so that the world knows that the Japanese are waging war without declaration, and that they have provoked the conflict. They are the public enemy of international peace, and the troublemakers of the Far East. All nations that uphold peace and justice should uphold justice and impose effective sanctions on the violent. Comrades who are waking up late, let us help each other in this difficult situation. We offer these urgent words, hoping that you will all work together. Signed, Jiangsu Provincial Social Education Institutions Federation (seal).</p>
<p>A telegram from Song Zheyuan and others in Beiping to all newspapers, schools, prominent figures in society, and all compatriots, both male and female, across the country for their consideration: Japan, disregarding international law, suddenly attacked Shenyang, occupied various institutions in Jilin, arrested officials, massacred merchants and civilians, cut off transportation, and acted freely. Moreover, their barbaric troops continue to advance. This kind of violent behavior is outrageous. According to international practice, when there are matters to be negotiated, they should be handled through proper procedures. To sever diplomatic relations, an ultimatum should be issued before declaring war. There has never been a case of a sudden armed attack on another country. This is something that even thieves would not do. It not only disregards our national rights and insults our nation, but also completely disregards international law. Moreover, our country has communist bandits to be annihilated, and floods are raging. European and American countries are still promoting neighborly relations, disaster relief, and raising funds to help. Yet Japan is taking advantage of our crisis to carry out aggression. This is intolerable. We urge our Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief to quickly inform all friendly nations and the League of Nations of the facts, to publicly judge right and wrong, and to unify the will of the nation and gather the strength of the nation to deal with the situation together. Zheyuan and others are military personnel and are responsible for protecting the country. We hereby lead our troops, prepared for battle, and would rather die in battle than be slaves of a conquered nation. We vow to overcome power with justice and fight to the end. We also ask all patriotic compatriots to put aside their differences and jointly relieve the national crisis. As for the advanced figures of the party and the nation, and our 400 million compatriots, we should quickly rise up, share a common hatred, and fight against the enemy. The survival of the nation and the life and death of the people depend on this one action. We offer these words with tears, and we humbly ask for your consideration. Signed, Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Lv Xiuwen, Liu Ruming, Zhang Zizhong, Feng Yean, Shen Ke, Ma Fa Wu, and all officers and soldiers (seal).</p>
<p>A telegram from the Judicial Administration Department's Judges Training Institute in Nanjing to all newspapers, forwarded to all compatriots across the country for their consideration: The Japanese bandits are in the eastern provinces, abusing officials and civilians, disregarding international law, and destroying world peace. The bad news has spread, and we are filled with anger. At this time of crisis, we should remember our duties as officials and hope that the whole country will unite as one, be prepared for battle, and support the country. We must immediately cease internal strife and jointly resist foreign insults. This urgent telegram is sent with tears, and we humbly ask for your consideration. Signed, Judicial Administration Department's Judges Training Institute Ma.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>An Appeal to the Nation Regarding the Japanese Disaster</h3>
<p>(Ma Xiangbo, the "Old Man of Ninety-Two")</p>
<p>Correct Past Mistakes, Jointly Face the National Crisis</p>
<p>Redeem Ourselves, Save Ourselves, Revive the Nation</p>
<p>Today, the whole country mourns the Japanese disaster. Although I am old, I am also a citizen. Where duty calls, I cannot refuse. I express my views to encourage my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>At this time of overlapping natural disasters, man-made calamities, external troubles, and internal strife, the people of the nation should understand that if a country is divided and cannot defend itself, it is because the country must first attack itself before others attack it. For the current situation, the best strategy is to redeem ourselves and save ourselves. Looking back at the current misfortunes, most of them are self-inflicted. Is it about money being exhausted? The money has been exhausted on military expenses of hundreds of millions of dollars, but there is no equipment for national defense. Is it about the people being impoverished? The people are impoverished, yet tens of millions of dollars are still spent on opium every year. However, no attention is paid to river defense. As a result, disasters suddenly erupt, and sixteen provinces become a marsh. The strong neighbor rejoices in our misfortune and launches a large-scale invasion. Thus, our territory and sovereignty outside Shanhaiguan have been completely trampled upon. The troubles of Lu have not ended; who is Qingfu? The people are not tired of chaos, so Heaven punishes China. Think about it quietly. Hubei attacks Hunan, and Guangxi attacks Guangdong. We are all from the same root; is there any gain or loss to be said? The cycle of civil war over the past twenty years is always the same. Alas! The country is poor and weak to this extreme. The government has no austerity measures, and the people have a penchant for extravagance. National morality is declining day by day, and the people's livelihood is becoming more and more difficult. Moreover, disaster is upon us. We recall the past glory of our history and the cultural heritage created by our ancestors. They gave us a great civilized country. Our future generations, even if they cannot promote and develop the ancestral legacy, should still follow in the footsteps of our ancestors and not fail to be a great nation. Only then can we be worthy of standing in the world. From now on, the people of the nation should have a clear resolve, correct past mistakes, redeem ourselves, save ourselves, unite our efforts, and jointly face the national crisis. Then, after ten years of recuperation and education, there will eventually be a day of self-strengthening and revival. Like the ancient sages Cheng Tang and Wei Wu, we should cultivate ourselves and take responsibility, which may help to turn the tide and save the nation. For without first restoring the inherent national moral spirit, there will be no truly loyal and willing citizens to sacrifice for the country. This can be stated with certainty. If the people have no sense of responsibility, then so be it. If they do, then please vow to start from today, redeem ourselves, save ourselves, and jointly face the national crisis. Moreover, since the Meiji Restoration, Japan's rapid progress in people's wisdom and morality has been impressive. This small island nation prides itself on being a great nation in East Asia. Its annexation and plundering have not been a matter of a day or two. It has been plotting to occupy our Northeast for nearly thirty years. Experts have designed and secretly implemented plans. But we are still fast asleep, allowing others to sleep soundly beside our bed. Only in the last two or three years have we begun to pay attention (such as establishing Japanese studies societies and other groups). They know us, but we do not know them. The battle is decided before it even begins. This time, the Japanese army's strong occupation of our famous cities in Liaoning and Jilin is like taking something out of a pocket. We have not resisted at all and have endured it. Is this not the same as waiting for death with our hands tied? Our land is lost, and there are no tears to shed. The Japanese are displaying the ferocity of the second German. In the Showa era, they are foolishly imitating Wilhelm II as the leader of the war. Previously, they were stealing secretly; now, they are looting during a fire. Their recent atrocities, such as robbing our banks and looting our people, have long placed international law and the Kellogg-Briand Pact in a position of disdain. This kind of behavior is like that of an international robber. It is like the former Germany, a threat to the world. The various atrocities that they are carrying out in the three eastern provinces of China today, who knows if they will not follow the same pattern and deal with the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, and other countries in the future? Therefore, there is a public opinion in the international community that is dissatisfied with the Japanese army's atrocities. This is not necessarily because they like us or are giving us favors. It is a policy that other countries should adopt for their own self-defense. We, the people of the nation, should express our gratitude to those who uphold justice. However, if we do not fundamentally eradicate the bad habit of always relying on others to speak for us, we will definitely not be able to redeem ourselves or save ourselves. Please pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Alas, the sovereignty of our Republic rests with the people. It is hoped that the true will of the people will be fully expressed. We must immediately cease internal strife and jointly resist foreign insults. As an old man like myself, I long for the land of my fathers to be as stable as a rock forever. Therefore, I do not hesitate to speak out and explain the great importance of self-redemption and self-salvation to the gentlemen of our country. But what causes the most heartache is that our country today is still in a state of being brave in private quarrels but cowardly in public indignation. I hope that in the future, without the public will of the people, we will absolutely not allow a single bullet to be wasted internally. Externally, we must not hesitate to spare a single bullet. May my people be roused and may my people rise up quickly!</p>
<p>Important News from Tianjin</p>
<h3>The Atrocities of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Shenyang, Changchun, and Yingkou Have All Been Forcibly Occupied</p>
<p>Transportation Between Tianjin and Shenyang Is Now Completely Blocked</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Remarks to Tianjin Reporters</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Japanese have been plotting the Northeast problem for more than just a day or two. The Wanbaoshan Incident was actually a kind of provocation. Fortunately, our side handled it calmly, and it did not lead to an incident. Therefore, recently, they have been making a big fuss over the so-called Nakamura Incident to achieve their ambitions of aggression. It has been rumored for more than a month that the Japanese army would act freely in the Northeast, but unexpectedly, it was realized the night before. They forcibly occupied Shenyang with violence, and at the same time, they successively occupied Changchun, Yingkou, Andong, and other places. Our losses were heavy, and there were many casualties. The people of the country were all gnashing their teeth when they heard about it. Here is a brief account of the Japanese army's occupation of Shenyang, obtained from transportation circles. Recently, the Japanese army in the Northeast has been provoking us at any time and any place, which is almost unbearable. Zhang Xueliang, in order to be cautious in dealing with foreign affairs, strictly ordered the troops stationed in the area to avoid conflicts as much as possible so that the Japanese would have no excuse. The Japanese plan did not succeed, so at about 11:00 PM the night before (the 18th), twenty armed Japanese soldiers surrounded the Beining Railway station at the intersection of Sandong Bridge North Beining and the South Manchuria Railway. First, they drove away the workers inside, and then they took away all the tools for repairing the railway, using them to destroy the tracks. A total of six sections were destroyed, about several dozen feet long. At that time, the Pingji train, when traveling to this point, could not pass through and stopped east of Shenyang station. The Japanese soldiers guarded the destroyed railway, and no one was allowed to come and go. At about 12:00 AM, another part of the Japanese army shelled Beida Camp in Shenyang, causing shock throughout the city. The First Brigade, led by Wang Yizhe, stationed in Shenyang, maintained calm and adopted a policy of non-resistance and retreat. As a result, the Japanese army entered the city en masse, invaded the barracks, and set them on fire. The grain depot and the mortar factory in Beida Camp were simultaneously blown up by the Japanese army with electric current. The fire had not been extinguished by yesterday afternoon. The institutions in various provinces and cities were occupied. Zang Shiyi, the chairman of the province, and Rong Zhen, the chief of staff of the Border Defense Command, were also captured by the Japanese army. After the Japanese army entered the city, all transportation facilities, such as telegraph and telephone, were cut off. Since 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the communication facilities between Pingjin and Shenyang have been completely blocked. After the First Brigade Commander Wang Yizhe's troops entered the city, they were disarmed, and Wang also suffered misfortune. All police stations were occupied at the same time, and many police officers were killed or injured. The exact number of deaths of merchants and civilians is unknown. The whole city is in a state of chaos. It is said that the Second Division of the Japanese Army entered the city. Yesterday, reinforcements continued to arrive and advanced towards Shenyang. Changchun and Yingkou were also occupied at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning. Battalion Commander Fu, stationed in Changchun, was shot and killed by the Japanese army. In Yingkou, two Japanese trains arrived first and tied up the battalion commander, stationmaster, and police chief. Their whereabouts are still unknown. Then, they shelled the Yingkou port with artillery. Our newly built wharves were all destroyed. A Japanese naval warship was stationed there, and it is said that sailors also landed to assist the army in its operations. Yesterday, the diplomatic corps stationed in Pingjin and the reporter corps in Pingjin sent personnel to Shenyang to investigate the situation. They arrived in Huanggu Village this afternoon. As for Tianjin, after hearing the news that the Japanese army had forcibly occupied Shenyang, the party, government, and military circles convened an emergency meeting yesterday morning to discuss countermeasures. Starting today, the entire city will fly flags at half-mast for three days to mourn the compatriots who were killed. They also sent a telegram to Guangdong, asking them to put aside their prejudices and unite against foreign aggression. The attitude of the Pingjin authorities is very calm. Mayor Zhang Xueming returned to Tianjin from Peiping this morning. After meeting with Chairman Wang Shuchang, he went to Peiping in the afternoon. I met Zhang at the station, and according to him, no news can be transmitted from Shenyang City. All transportation facilities are in the hands of the Japanese army. In addition to asking the National Government for instructions, the Deputy Commander is considering ways to deal with the situation. He hopes that all sectors of society will work together and not rely solely on the government's strength. Before a solution is determined, he hopes that the citizens will continue as usual and not take any radical actions. Therefore, the situation in the city has remained normal for the past two days. Although the Beining train to Tianjin is still operating as usual this morning, it only sells tickets to Xinmin Station. It is said that many refugees from Shenyang are along the stations. There is also news that Japanese residents in Shanhaiguan are gathering in Tianjin. (September 20)</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao received news that Shenyang had been occupied by the Japanese army and immediately drove to Xiehe Hospital to visit Vice Commander Zhang. It was 10:00 AM. The guards and others already knew about the Shenyang Incident and were whispering to each other, appearing quite nervous. After a while, Zhang came out to meet with a recovered spirit and normal gait. His ears had also healed greatly. There were many guests waiting to see him. Zhang hurriedly told the reporter, "You have come to inquire about the news of Shenyang, right? I will tell you the truth. I have long ordered my soldiers not to resist the Japanese army's provocations. Therefore, the troops in Beida Camp were ordered to turn in their weapons and store them in the armory. At about 10:00 PM last night (the 18th), the Japanese army suddenly climbed into our camp with 300 men and opened fire. Our army was unarmed, so there was no resistance. Three people were killed. Previously, the Japanese used a locomotive to carry soldiers to the intersection of the Sino-Japanese railway in Huanggu Village and blew it up, and then retreated. Therefore, the Japanese claimed that our army destroyed the tracks of the South Manchuria Railway, which is absolutely untrue. How could we do such a thing since we are trying to avoid Japanese provocations? The consuls of various countries stationed in Shenyang can understand the truth. After the Japanese soldiers entered Beida Camp, every five to ten minutes, they fired artillery from the affiliated area, directly bombing Beida Camp and the arsenal. I immediately consulted with the Japanese Consul General Hayashi in Shenyang and asked him to stop it within five minutes. Hayashi first asked for a limit of ten minutes, and then telegraphed that it had become a military operation and that he could not stop it. Since then, the</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>soldiers occupied all means of transportation, and even my residence was guarded by Japanese soldiers. However, the order was not disrupted until 6:30 AM yesterday. Our officials and civilians were not prepared to resist. I believe Chairman Zang Shiyi will do his best to maintain order in the city and prevent it from being disrupted. This matter should be handled by the government through negotiations. Japan has neither issued an ultimatum nor declared war, but has actually taken military action, which is incomprehensible. I still hope that the people will remain calm and patient and not create complications. Up to the time of the interview, the report I received was only up to 6:30 AM on the 19th." The reporter then asked about the Nakamura Incident. Zhang replied that the Japanese pointed out that the leader of the responsible group, Guan Yuhang, had been arrested in the Gendarmerie Command, and high officials such as Commander Chen Xingya had been sent to investigate. It can be seen that we must do everything according to the law. However, before the crime is clear, it is of course inconvenient to bring the suspects to justice. Moreover, negotiations on this matter are in progress, and there is absolutely no reason to resort to force.</p>
<p>The People of Wuhan</p>
<h3>Organize a National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>Vow to Resist the Atrocities of Japan</p>
<p>Telegraph to Guangdong to Cease Strife and Defend Against Insults</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: This time, the Japanese soldiers acted fiercely and forcibly occupied various places in Shenyang, acting violently. The people of Wuhan were very indignant and vowed to wash away the national shame. Starting on the 21st, they all wore black gauze on their arms, stopped banquets and entertainment, and various organizations flew flags at half-mast to express their grief. The Hubei Provincial Party Department Provisional Consolidation Committee, the Hankou Special City Party Department Provisional Consolidation Committee, the Pinghan Railway Special Party Department Preparatory Committee, and the Wu-Chang-Zhu-Ping Railway Special Party Department Preparatory Committee, in addition to convening emergency meetings to discuss countermeasures, also held a joint meeting at 2:00 PM on the 21st in the auditorium of the Provincial Party Department in Wuchang. Hundreds of members of the four party departments and representatives of various people's organizations in Wuhan attended the meeting. After paying their respects, the chairman, Yu Yuzhi, reported the general situation of the Japanese army's atrocities. Then, it was submitted for discussion. After discussion, it was decided to organize a national salvation association to resist the enemy together, and Wen Juntian, Zeng Juexian, and others were elected to draft the articles of association, so that they could be submitted to the second general meeting on the 22nd for approval and establishment. It is said that the association will set up action and propaganda committees to facilitate the process. The candidates for the committee will also be elected on the 22nd and will start working immediately. If necessary, branch associations can also be set up in Yichang, Wuxue, and other cities, so that we can work together to save the crisis. In addition, the Provincial Party Department sent a telegram to the Central National Government on the 21st, requesting that a strategy be quickly decided, and also sent a telegram to the Guangdong authorities, urging them to immediately cease internal strife and jointly face the national crisis. The Hankou Municipal Party Department and the Pinghan Railway Special Party Department also expressed the same views (the telegram is omitted due to space constraints).</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Excitement in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>An Anti-Japanese Meeting of More Than 20,000 People</p>
<p>The Entire City Flies Flags at Half-Mast to Express Grief</p>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: The Japanese army trampled on the eastern provinces, and Xuzhou received a radio message on the evening of the 19th. The local newspapers of the 20th were filled with reports, and the public was suddenly tense. The Party Department was preparing to commemorate Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom and promote the national goods movement, so it issued an emergency notice to hold an anti-Japanese rally at the same time. Today (the 21st) morning, people from all walks of life gathered at the large sports field of the People's Education Center. Most of the organizations, groups, and schools participated fully, with about 20,000 people attending. The meeting began at 9:00 AM. The chairman of the Party Committee, Xu Ximing, reported the significance of the meeting. Then, representatives of various groups gave speeches, which were passionate and tearful. After discussing the proposals, four important telegrams were unanimously passed: (1) Telegraph to the Central Government, urging the implementation of revolutionary diplomacy against Japan; (2) Telegraph to Guangdong, urging them to cease military operations immediately and unite against foreign aggression; (3) Send a telegram to the whole country, urging everyone to form powerful armed organizations; (4) Telegraph to the Central Government, urging the dismissal and investigation of Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, and warning the Northeast Border Defense Commander. The telegrams were sent on the spot. The meeting ended at 11:00 AM and a parade was held. The entire group set off, with a total of 132 groups, plus citizens, the line stretched for seven or eight miles, encircling the city's railway station, shouting slogans like thunder. It dispersed at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Today, the entire city flies flags at half-mast to express grief, and various anti-Japanese slogans are posted in front of all shops. (September 21)</p>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Party and Government Authorities</p>
<h3>Request Preparation of Strength to Confront Japan</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Party and Government authorities, in response to the Japanese army's forcible occupation of various places in our eastern provinces, held an emergency talk today (September 22) and decided: (1) To telegraph the Central Government to seriously negotiate with Japan and prepare to deal with it with strength; (2) To telegraph condolences to Vice Commander Zhang and all the military and civilians in the Northeast; (3) To telegraph to the Guangdong comrades, urging them to consider the national crisis, eliminate personal prejudices, and unite against Japan. The telegram to the Central Government is recorded below: To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the National Government, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force: Having read the telegrams from Your Committee and Vice Commander Zhang, and having read the reports in various newspapers, we are shocked to learn that Japan attacked and destroyed our Beida Camp, occupied our Shenyang, killed our military officers, plundered our people, and recently occupied Changchun, Liaoyang, Andong, Yingkou, and Lianshan Bay on September 18th and 19th, and has even shown signs of moving into Shanhaiguan. All parties, including the Party, government, military, and civilians, are filled with anger. It is believed that Japan has been plotting to seize Manchuria and Mongolia for more than a day. Unexpectedly, they have launched an unprovoked invasion, looting freely, disregarding world justice, and destroying East Asian peace. They dare to set a bad international precedent and disregard the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Their intention is nothing more than to take advantage of our natural disasters, the prevalence of internal strife, and the belief that we are unable to resist and can do whatever they want. Therefore, compared to the previous invasion of Jinan, it is even more barbaric. Such humiliation and pain is irreconcilable. We ask that the diplomatic authorities be ordered to seriously negotiate with Japan, and the military authorities across the country be ordered to prepare their strength and not make any further concessions, lest we suffer the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction. This urgent telegram expresses our utmost anticipation. Signed, Zhejiang Provincial Party Department and Provincial Government (seal).</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Rumors are rife about opening the Eastern Dam, and the collapse of the Eastern Dam in Liyang. Previously, there were widespread rumors about opening up the Su (Suzhou) and Chang (Changzhou) areas, causing great panic among the people. They have been sending telegrams to the provincial government requesting a halt to protect the lives of tens of millions of people. The Director of Civil Affairs also recognizes the importance of the dam and has dispatched a provincial security team to protect it. However, on the 19th of this month, a boat traveling from Liyang to Gaochun saw slogans calling for the demolition of the Eastern Dam plastered on the walls of Gaochun. Subsequently, a Mr. Wang from Liyang copied the slogans and returned to Liyang to report it. The Director of the Construction Bureau, Shi Ziquan, upon receiving the report, urgently consulted with County Magistrate Chen Xi, who immediately dispatched a company of the provincial security team to protect it. Many local residents are also guarding the dam day and night. Yesterday, Chen Rongquan, the manager of the Yonggu Shipping Bureau in Wuxi, received an urgent telegram from Liyang stating that tens of thousands of Anhui residents had gathered at the Eastern Dam, forcefully attempting to open it, and that the situation was urgent. When County Magistrate Chen of Wuxi heard about this, he also telegraphed Liyang to inquire and confirmed that it was indeed happening, although not as widespread as rumored. Qian Sunqing, the chairman of the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, at 9 PM that evening, in conjunction with the Flood Relief Committee, urgently telegraphed the provincial government, stating that it concerned the lives and property of tens of millions of people in Jiangnan and urgently requested the immediate dispatch of troops to protect it. They also sent telegrams to the counties of Wuxi, Liyang, and Gaochun, instructing them to pay attention to defense and not be negligent in the slightest. Chairman Qian also sent a quick letter to the Liyang Chamber of Commerce, scheduling a joint meeting of the relevant county chambers of commerce at the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce on October 1st to discuss relief measures. The county authorities also decided that night to hire several steamships, keep the fires burning, and be ready to depart. If an alert is received from Liyang, Wuxi will consider dispatching police and large units of investigators, and negotiate with the local troops to rush to assist in protecting the dam to safeguard the lives and property of tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Mass Meeting Wuxi's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Mass Meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 1 PM in the open space below the train station. More than 100,000 people from all walks of life attended. Chairman Li Tiping passed the following resolutions: (1) Send a telegram to the whole country to unanimously call for a cessation of hostilities and peace to jointly resist foreign aggression.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Yi, Education Committee Investigator, Investigates the Nanching Expulsion-of-Principal Incident. The Education Department dispatched Provincial Inspector Yi Jianlou to Cheng (Jiangyin) to investigate the Nanching Middle School's expulsion of principal incident triggered by students. Inspector Yi first arrived in Shanghai on the 16th to investigate the Nanching school property. On the 18th, he came to Cheng. For several days, teachers and students have been presenting the situation to Inspector Yi. On the 20th, he met with County Magistrate Peng at the county government. In the afternoon, he held a meeting of teachers and staff at Nanching. Inspector Yi indicated that an agreement had been reached with Feng Taiyuan regarding finances, and payments would be made according to the agreement. If the student self-governing body obstructs, he would be responsible. He said that after he returns to the province to report, if financial problems arise, County Magistrate Peng would be responsible. However, Feng Taiyuan only has a remaining balance of over seven thousand yuan, which can only support operations for two months. As for future finances, a telegram has been sent to Chen Gucen, the school board director in charge of finances, to return to Cheng to handle the matter. In the afternoon, the student self-governing body requested a meeting to ask Inspector Yi to explain, but Inspector Yi refused. Inspector Yi will need to investigate the expulsion-of-principal incident for several more days before returning to the province to report.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits in Dayu Town More than 20 bandit ships, carrying over 300 bandits, suddenly arrived in Dayu Town, Juegang, at 2 AM on the 21st. They landed, hoping to loot grain and supplies from the residents. They were intercepted by the police and local militia, and fierce fighting continued until dawn, at which point the bandits fled by ship. The losses were minor.</p>
<p>Collecting Evidence of Japanese Ship Causing Disaster The Yijin Maru of the Dalian Steamship Company struck and sank a Xu Hui cargo ship on the Nantong section of the Yangtze River. The county government reported this to the provincial government, which then consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Japanese ambassador. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then approved the Japanese ambassador's reply, which stated that the Dalian Steamship Company claimed that the sailing ship did not have its sails up at the time. When the Yijin Maru discovered the sailing ship in its path, it had already approached the ship's vicinity. The ship immediately reversed and dropped anchor, but it was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, the Dalian Steamship Company should not bear any responsibility for this collision. The captain of the Yijin Maru signed a written statement acknowledging that the case would be resolved in Shanghai when he left port in Tianshenggang, but he claimed that he was coerced by the local maritime officials. On the 21st, County Magistrate Zhang received an order to investigate each item in this case and collect sufficient evidentiary documents to submit to the ministry for rebuttal.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Strange Death of a Soil Vendor Qian A'si, a well-known soil vendor from Pinghu's East City River Beach (also known as Xiang A'si), was reported to the county government on the 19th for allegedly selling opium. The county government arrested Qian and found a package of red pills. The next day, during interrogation, he was sentenced to four months in prison and fined one hundred yuan, to be executed in prison. Unexpectedly, upon being sent to the prison, he cried out and died. The truth of his death is subject to various rumors. Some say he committed suicide out of fear of punishment, while others say that his concubine, Qian Yang'shi, laced his food with poison. The truth will never be know. However, after Qian died, he bled from seven orifices, suggesting that Yang'shi was likely involved in killing him. At 3 PM on the 21st, the county government sent Examiner Song, along with a forensic official, to conduct an examination. The examination concluded that he died from poisoning. Yang'shi was arrested and will be interrogated further.</p>

<h3>丨Record of the Awards Ceremony丨</h3>
<p>The awards and closing ceremony of the city's Second Municipal Games was held at 4 PM yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Mayor Zhang, Director Xu of the Education Bureau, Director Hu of the Health Bureau, Secretary Feng of the Public Security Bureau, guests, and over 500 athletes and winners attended. The ceremony was performed as usual. Mayor Zhang delivered a training speech, roughly stating that the results of this Municipal Games had four advantages: 1. The number of participants was greater than the first Games, indicating that physical education in Shanghai has become more popular than before. 2. The female athletes who participated in this competition achieved special results, proving that they have worked hard in the past year. 3. This Games broke national records, indicating that technology has improved since advancements. 4. This Games included swimming and national health events, which further highlights Shanghai's special achievements. I hope that there will be progress every year in the future. Currently, our country is suffering from natural disasters and man-made disasters, and internal troubles are urgent. In addition, with foreign aggression, considering the future, one cannot help but feel a chill. I sincerely hope that society and the government will work together to restore the entire national spirit, endure hardship, and accumulate strength in order to deal with everything. This Games was hosted by the Education Bureau and received much assistance from all walks of life, which is deeply appreciated. The health exercises of the municipal government staff had over 200 participants with good results. Therefore, we can see that the student emphasized sports. The government encourages the same, and all sectors further their efforts. Future achievements will have new records, and it will not be difficult for Shanghai to become a model city that focuses on sports. Next, Secretary Feng of the Public Security Bureau spoke, roughly stating that only with strong physiques and full spirits can people undertake great things. He hoped that people would pay attention to sports and work hard to exercise. Finally, Director Xu reported two thoughts on this Games: (1) Judging from the records of various sports, the progress of athletes in general is rapid, especially the progress of female athletes, which is even faster and worth commemorating. (2) Under the current serious state, I hope everyone will work as hard on all construction projects as they do on sports. Not only can they resist foreign aggression, but in other words, there is nothing that cannot be achieved one day. Next, Director Xu gave out the awards, and the ceremony was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Educational Circles Face the National Crisis</h3>
<p>Implement Military Training, Economically Sever Ties with Japan, Spiritually Unite as One</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Anti-Japanese Movement</p>
<p>Xujiahui Jiaotong University held a general meeting of all students at 10 AM yesterday, resolving to suspend classes in order to promote awareness to all sectors. An Anti-Japanese Committee was specially formed, divided into four departments: general affairs, discipline, propaganda, and lectures, as well as attending representatives. The lecture department divided the students within the school into numbered teams, totaling 70 teams, each with 10 people. At 2 PM on the 22nd, they went to Xujiahui, Fahua Town, Longhua, and the Southern City, where the audience was extremely enthusiastic. The propaganda department printed various slogans, leaflets, and multiple circular telegrams. The department also has an information section that specializes in investigating news of the Japanese army from various newspapers in order to promote awareness early in the morning. They also went to various schools to discuss procedures. However, fearing that students might slack off during the suspension of classes, special discipline department personnel were dispatched to supervise and monitor. A sign-in sheet was placed at the school gate, and students entering and leaving the school were required to sign in to prevent evasion. Representatives Yuan Bingnan, Cheng Weinan, Liu Liangzhan, and three others were sent to the municipal government yesterday to meet with Mayor Zhang for talks.</p>
<h3>Students of Jinan University Overflowing with Passionate Indignation</h3>
<p>Students of Jinan University, angered by the Japanese military's unreasonable and forceful occupation of the Eastern Provinces, convened an emergency meeting last night. In addition to uniting with various universities in Shanghai for joint action, they also sent telegrams to overseas Chinese compatriots in various regions, expressing a serious anti-Japanese stance.

<p>Yesterday's Delegates' Assembly of Various Groups</p>

<p>Expand the Anti-Japanese Association...Organize Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Those Who Disrupt the Boycott Movement Will Be Executed Without Mercy</p>
<p>Citizens' Assembly Scheduled for the 26th</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Committee convened a delegates' assembly of various circles at 9:00 AM yesterday in the City Chamber of Commerce hall at Tianhou Temple Bridge. Over 5,000 attendees included representatives from various circles such as Hu Shuhua, Wang Xiaolai, and Wang Yansong, as well as over 800 organizations from various industries and student groups, including Jiaotong University, Soochow University, and the Law School. The atmosphere at the assembly was extremely passionate. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Assembly Staff: Presidium: Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Hou Dachun, Tao Baichuan, Lu Jingshi; Recorders: Feng Yixian, Xue Guangqian; Master of Ceremonies: Yuan Hongjun.</p>
<p>Assembly Order: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the party anthem; (3) Pay the highest respects to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the Premier with three bows; (4) The Chairman reverently reads the Premier's will (Wang Yansong); (5) Observe three minutes of silence to mourn the deceased officials and civilians; (6) Chairman's report, Tao Baichuan; (7) Discussion of proposals; (8) Ad hoc motions; (9) Speeches from various sectors; (10) Shout slogans; (11) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Tao Baichuan reported: "Distinguished representatives, today the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Committee has convened a delegates' assembly of various groups in Shanghai. Its most important significance lies in this time of grief, indignation, life-or-death crisis, to examine whether the blood of the citizens of Shanghai has turned cold, whether the organization of the various groups in Shanghai is sound, and whether the citizens of Shanghai are still asleep, not thinking of rising up to resist Japan. Seeing the enthusiastic attendance at the meeting, it shows the passionate indignation of the citizens of Shanghai and the soundness of the organization. If all the people of the country can be as grief-stricken as the citizens of Shanghai, and if we use the heads and hot blood of our 400 million compatriots to fight the 60 million Japanese, what do we have to fear? This time, the Japanese atrocities have brazenly disregarded the great disapproval of the world, deploying heavy troops to occupy the Eastern Provinces, disrupting peace in East Asia. Their pretext is the Nakamura Incident. Whether Nakamura exists as a person and whether Nakamura traveled to the Eastern Provinces, there is still no conclusive evidence presented. However, the Japanese did not use formal channels to resolve the issue, and instead deployed troops to occupy Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, Jilin, and other places. The reason they did not declare war is that they want to imitate the old trick of the Soviet Union two years ago, using artillery to bombard the Northeast, first occupying the territory, and then negotiating with us. Under the city's alliance, the Japanese are bound to win. From this, we can know that the Japanese dispatch of troops to the Eastern Provinces this time, the Nakamura Incident, is only a propaganda material. The true intention is to annex the Northeast and conquer China. Therefore, only the power of the entire Chinese nation, rising up to resist Japan, is sufficient to save China and protect the nation. Even if we do not consider the current life and death, we should also think about future generations, raising our arms and sacrificing ourselves to serve the country. Some people say that with China's current weakness, there is really no way to resist the Japanese atrocities. The only way is to request a third country to mediate. However, mediation must first have self-defense actions. In the face of Japan's barbaric challenge, our army does not engage in legitimate defense and adheres to the principle of absolute non-resistance. The Japanese advance one step, and we retreat two steps. In this state, what self-defense is there, and what opportunity is there for mediation? Even if we put this aside, is there fair judgment in the third-party mediation? According to the words of U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, the actions of the Japanese this time have not violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact, so the signatory countries cannot speak out on this basis. Japan's dispatch of troops to occupy the Eastern Provinces, all actions, everyone knows, is no different from a state of war. The United States, as the initiator of the Peace Pact, still makes this fallacy. Other countries are even more out of the question. Does the world still have reason and justice? Therefore, our desire for third-party mediation, our desire to fight for the existence of reason and justice, is tantamount to surrendering to Japan. We must first have the sacrifice of some people, fight the Japanese, otherwise, without any resistance, we are willing to surrender. In terms of China's current position, the Japanese will also reject and refuse to accept it. Whether we advocate war, whether we advocate peace, or whether we beg for surrender, we must prepare the whole country consistently. I hope that compatriots will prepare themselves." Representative Report: Zheng Chengqing, a representative for appealing to the capital, reported, in brief, that he was recommended by the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Committee, together with Wang Hanliang, Li Yongxiang, Tang Junsheng, Chen Yasheng, and other four comrades, to appeal to the central government in the capital. They were received by Wu Zhihui, Zhang Jingjiang, Dai Jitao, and other members of the Central Committee. The purpose of the representatives' petition was threefold: (1) Concentrate national military forces and unite against foreign aggression; (2) Request the Central Government to implement revolutionary diplomacy; (3) Implement national economic severance. Comrade Dai Jitao gave a sincere and satisfactory reply, stating that according to information from the central government, the Guangdong government will soon make a peaceful statement. In addition, the Central Government showed the representatives that there are three things it hopes all compatriots across the country will consistently follow: (1) Except for the Communist Party, which endangers the nation, all compatriots across the country should not be divided and should unite; (2) In addition to the anti-Japanese movement, the people of the country must work harder to relieve disaster to save compatriots; (3) Comrades of this party, at this time when the survival of the country is at stake, should eliminate their opinions and jointly face national difficulties.</p>

<p>Assembly Declaration: The Shanghai All-Circles Delegates' Assembly declared that with regard to the brutal movement of the Japanese army to continuously invade and occupy key areas of Liaoning, Ning, Jilin, and Yingkou since September 18, the Shanghai All-Circles Delegates' Assembly held a meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the 22nd, and with the unanimous and enthusiastic expression of the entire venue, resolved the following cases: (1) Telegraphed to the National Government to immediately issue a general mobilization order for the army, navy, and air force to expel Japanese troops from the country and restore lost territory; (2) A circular telegram was sent to the country to unite forces and unanimously resist Japan; (3) Expand the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, reorganize the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Committee into the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee; (4) The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee will organize an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps to recruit volunteer members; (5) Thoroughly implement economic severance with Japan; (6) A telegram was sent to the National Government to return the Japanese relief money and goods, and the people themselves will raise donations for relief. The above-mentioned cases are indeed urgent measures to defend against insults and save ourselves. We humbly believe that people who save the country share the same heart, and there is no turning back. We earnestly hope that compatriots across the country will rise up together, on the one hand, urge the government to concentrate its forces, consolidate the army, and preserve the territory, and fight the violent Japan to the final victory, on the other hand, strictly organize, actively promote thorough cargo clearance, and earnestly resist Japan, to promote the self-awareness of the people of that country and awaken the sympathy of the human race in the world. The matter of survival is related to life and death. We express our declaration and hope that it will be made public.</p>

<p>Today, Entertainment Venues Will Suspend Business to Express Condolences</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education Called a Meeting with the Entertainment Industry Yesterday to Discuss</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education convened an emergency meeting at the bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, gathering over thirty people from various circles, including stage theaters, storytellers, entertainers, and tabloid newspapers, to discuss concrete measures for national salvation propaganda.</p>
<p>The meeting was chaired by Li Dachao, section chief of the Bureau of Education. After the meeting was held as usual, the chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting, and then made a simple speech to the effect that Japan relies on its strength to insult our country, invade our territory, and seize our land, which did not start today. However, the authorities of our country have repeatedly made concessions to maintain peace, but the Japanese government's ambitions are rampant, and it has brutally occupied Shenyang, intending to annex the Northeast, lost all humanity, and destroyed reason. If the government and people of our country do not unite to rise up, jointly plan to resist Japan, and make serious representations, then not only will they not be able to contain the realization of their ambitions on the continent, but when will the current humiliation be redressed? This is truly a critical juncture for the survival of our nation. All of you present are part of the Republic of China. You should have a considerable understanding of the incident of the Japanese army's occupation of our country, and you should unite to propagate everywhere, awaken the people, and deeply awaken national salvation. The above remarks aroused the sympathy and indignation of the participants. Soon, discussions began.</p>
<p>Four Resolutions: Four resolutions were made: (1) On the 23rd, all entertainment agencies will suspend entertainment for one day to express condolences; (2) All drama troupes, theaters, entertainment storytelling groups, and tabloid newspapers will all compile, perform, narrate, and publish reports on the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers, and conduct anti-Japanese propaganda; (3) All sectors will jointly organize an anti-Japanese propaganda national salvation association; (4) If problems arise in the second and third items, the municipal government should be responsible for handling them. The meeting was adjourned.</p>

Nine committee members, including Hu Shuhua, Jiang Hengyuan, Zheng Tonghe, Yang Weiyu, Zhao Lvqing, Chen Gonglu, Ni Wenya, Chen Dianyang, and Jia Foru, were present, and Hu Shuhua was publicly elected as temporary chairman.

<p>Circular Telegram to the Whole Country (Title omitted) I am informed that our country is unfortunately suffering from frequent disasters year after year, and the people have no home. Recently, reunification has been broken, and floods have caused disasters. The banditry in Gan and Hubei has not yet been quelled, and the famine in Jianghuai is widespread. The people are afraid that they will not be able to save the dead. Now, the bad news has come that Japan has taken advantage of our national mourning and openly sent troops to occupy our Three Eastern Provinces, burning, looting, and killing, which is inhuman. Our government's deployment of troops and defenses has not been well-prepared, and it has sat back and watched the loss of our territory, which is unbearable in the first battle. What can be entrusted to the fate of the country? It is painful to say. In recent days, education circles in Shanghai have been running around and gathering to discuss matters, and grief and anger have filled their chests. When national difficulties are at hand, how dare we remain silent? We express our blood and loyalty to respectfully inform you. Political views may have differences, but the country is truly united. Protecting the race and defending the nation are the same in people's hearts. If the country does not exist, what will the government be? We earnestly hope that you will immediately discard your opinions, restore peace and unification, and jointly plan to deal with foreign countries in order to survive. If you do not act now, the country will be destroyed in no time. The country's military force is responsible for defending against insults. Now that violent Japan has occupied our land and insulted our compatriots, it still claims that it is making concessions again and again. Where is the dignity of the great Chinese nation? It is difficult for people with blood and energy to tolerate it. We urge the government authorities to immediately consolidate the army and prepare for war, and strive to resist. The people of the whole country will work together with one heart to support the government. We, the education circles in Shanghai, will also lead students to intensify military training, thoroughly implement economic severance with Japan, taste gall and sleep on firewood, and jointly avenge our great shame. At present, we should wait patiently for the government's prudent measures. If necessary, we will give up our lives and drive out, which we will not hesitate to do. We also hope that the government authorities will, within the scope of possibility, clearly announce all the details of diplomacy, so that the people of the country can clearly understand the truth and be more determined to live and die together. The Shanghai Education Circles National Salvation Federation respectfully appeals (the telegram to the League of Nations and the peoples of various countries should not be published for the time being)</p>
<h3>Circular Telegram from the National Government</h3>
<p>The People of the Whole Country Wait Patiently for a Proper Solution</p>
<p>This port's military and political agencies received a circular telegram from the National Government: (Title omitted) According to reports, the Japanese army occupied Shenyang in the early morning, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese government, demanding the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops, and has also telegraphed the League of Nations to arouse the world's attention. Recently, Secretary Uemura of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, on the order of the Japanese government, came to the Foreign Office to state that the Japanese government believes that the unfortunate clash in Shenyang has been prevented from expanding, and has ordered the protection of overseas Chinese in Japan. Please also protect Japanese nationals in China in the same way. At this time of disaster and foreign insults, our people must be patient, calm, and uphold the attitude of solidarity and unity, and must avoid extra-track actions, lest they be taken advantage of by reactionaries,</p>

<p>To create a pretext and harm the overall situation. In addition to ordering the Executive Yuan to secretly follow the instructions, the subordinate departments are instructed to pay close attention to protecting Japanese nationals and earnestly persuade the people to maintain order and await the government's proper solution. This is of utmost importance. National Government stamp</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang</p>
<h3>Hope That Citizens Will Remain Calm</h3>
<p>A reporter from Huadong News Agency interviewed Mayor Zhang of the Municipal Government yesterday, because Japanese in Shanghai are quite provocative towards the Chinese side, hoping to cause unfortunate incidents and use them as an excuse to send troops to Shanghai. Secretary Guo was sent by Zhang to receive the reporter. According to Secretary Guo, the Japanese provocation is obviously ulterior, but our people must remain calm and not act rashly, lest they be taken advantage of by the other side. After the incident of Japanese atrocities was launched, the municipal government secretly ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly prevent the occurrence of unfortunate incidents. Now, the National Government has also issued a telegram to all subordinates to this effect, protecting the safety of the Japanese on the one hand and persuading the people to wait for the government's proper negotiations on the other hand.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Xizeng, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, convened a temporary emergency meeting of the district chiefs at two o'clock yesterday afternoon. As a result, it was decided to increase police force at the junction of the Chinese and foreign concessions at the end of Jiangwan Road North Sichuan Road for defensive purposes, and to increase the number of patrols, reduce internal work, and pay attention to external security. However, it will still maintain a calm attitude towards the Japanese military's demonstrations and provocations in order to avoid lightly initiating disputes.</p>

<p>The Tenth District Party Department's circular regarding Japan stated: (Omitted above) At this critical juncture where survival hangs by a thread, besides telegraphing the Central Government to send troops to declare war and expel the Japanese soldiers from our territory, returning our land, we wish our comrades and compatriots to be vigilant and awakened, united in heart and soul, working together, striving hard, facing the national crisis together, preferring to be shattered jade rather than surviving as broken tiles. The telegram cannot express the extreme sorrow and indignation. Sincerely, The Executive Committee of the Tenth District of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an old man named Zhao Yan, sobbing and swallowing his voice, requested this newspaper to publish the following appeal: "Zhao Yan cries before all comrades in the provincial, municipal, county, and district party departments, saying that the Japanese are sending troops to invade, seizing our territory and killing our compatriots. All with blood in their veins are heartbroken and enraged. If preparations are not made early, national subjugation and racial extinction are imminent. It is hoped that all comrades in the provincial, municipal, county, and district party departments will make every effort to propagate to the masses, rise up quickly and catch up, and jointly resist foreign insults. This is my hope and prayer."</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Movement by Postal Workers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union held an emergency joint meeting the day before yesterday (the 21st) in the Postal Workers' Union. Over forty executive and supervisory committee members attended.

<p>Methods of the Five-Person Anti-Japanese Group</p>
<p>The Five-Person Anti-Japanese Group's public notice states: Respected Sirs, Japan has been scheming for years to destroy China. Over the past decade, its intentions have become increasingly clear. Recently, it has even dispatched troops without cause, occupying Shenyang and other important locations in the eastern provinces, implementing a policy of annexation. National subjugation is imminent. We who are determined to save the nation lack the strength to wield weapons. We intend to do what we can to fulfill our duty as citizens. Considering that Japanese goods rely on China as their sole outlet, if we can cut off that outlet, Japan will inevitably collapse. Therefore, we invite comrades to passively resist and boycott. The method is to first gather five comrades, swear an oath to heaven, and henceforth, regarding clothing, food, shelter, and transportation, except for cultural and medical items, and other things that Japanese goods are the only alternative, no longer purchase them at all, until the day when Japan abolishes all unequal treaties with China and ceases all acts of aggression and occupation against China. All members who join this five-person group must each invite four other comrades with patriotic spirit to form a group. These four people must also each invite four other comrades to form a group. By inviting and expanding in this manner, we aim for the five-person anti-Japanese group to spread throughout the country, using its patriotic sincerity to implement economic severance. However, this organization only guarantees its oath with personal integrity. There is no such thing as a general group or branch group, nor are there any meetings or gatherings. There are no penalty clauses for members who violate the oath. As for raising funds, opening factories, revitalizing industry, etc., members are free to handle these matters on their own, which are not within the scope of this group's organizational purpose, so there are no membership fees or donations, etc. If each group member can act with enthusiasm and determination, advancing separately and persevering to the end, the expected results can be considerable within a year. Within five years, Japan will inevitably suffer a major blow, and it will be easy and effortless for us. Anyone can implement this, and success depends on human effort. We hope that patriotic people will enthusiastically promote and cooperate in persevering. As long as there is breath, this aspiration will not cease. This is most sincere.

<p>Ningbo Association Conference Resolution</p>
<p>The Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai convened an emergency meeting yesterday, and Zhang Jiguang was elected as chairman. Zhang Shenzhi first reported that today's meeting was convened specifically to discuss the Japan issue. The Shaoxing Seven Counties Sojourners Association in Shanghai has proposed convening a joint meeting of sojourner associations from various places in Shanghai to unite and lead the citizens of this city to unanimously resist foreign aggression. After the chairman submitted it for discussion, it was resolved and passed, and it was planned to hold a joint meeting on the 25th of this month. Next, it was resolved to send telegrams to all parties, eliminate opinions, and share difficulties. Next, it was resolved to draft a plan for economic severance with Japan and submit it to the joint meeting of various sojourner associations for discussion, and to send telegrams to Nanjing, Beiping, and Guangzhou with sincere words, urging all parties to quickly end internal disputes and jointly resist foreign insults. The wording was extremely painful.</p>
<p>Important Telegram from the Shaoxing Association</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Association held a board meeting yesterday and resolved to distribute various telegrams. The telegram texts are as follows: (1) To Nanjing, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, and Beiping, Deputy Commander Zhang: Our eastern neighbor is unjust, occupying Shenyang and Liaoning. We still have a country, people, and government. We should respond to this injustice. In addition to resisting inferior goods through national efforts, punishing and promoting martial valor and pacifying the people with one burst of anger, relies on the navy, army, and air force. I am unworthy to discuss matters of danger and utter these urgent words. (2) To Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Chief: Our unjust eastern neighbor, taking advantage of our bandits and disasters, occupies our Liaoning and Shenyang. We still have a country. National defense should be complete, and the national foundation should be even more solid. At the time of resisting insults, I beg your Excellency to not alter the original plan of suppressing bandits and relieving disasters. (3) To Nanjing National Government Foreign Minister: The unjust eastern neighbor suddenly occupies our Liaoning and Shenyang, committing a great injustice, destroying world peace. Even if they display their power, is there no justice? I beg your Excellency to quickly announce their atrocities to the international community and not let demons escape the clear mirror. (4) To Guangdong Gu Xiangqin, Wang Jingwei, Sun Zhesheng, and other gentlemen: Our eastern neighbor is moving at an opportune moment, not just yesterday or today. They hid their evil intentions in the past and now reveal their false faces, driving straight in, occupying our Shenyang and Liaoning. When brothers fight each other, how can we resist foreign insults? I beg you gentlemen to see the big picture and cooperate with the central government to unanimously resist Japan.</p>
<p>YWCA Resolution</p>
<p>Ms. Ding Shujing, General Secretary of the National Association of the Chinese Christian Young Women's Association, convened an executive committee and a temporary emergency meeting of the secretariat for the past two days to discuss countermeasures against the Japan issue. It was resolved to send telegrams to the World YWCA, the International Women's Association, and the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom to awaken international women's attention to the truth of Japan's fabrication of words and violence, and its destruction of world peace, and to ask them to uphold justice and maintain fairness, and to promote a non-cooperation movement to deal with the violent Japan and urge it to awaken. It is said that the telegram has now been translated into English and can be sent out today.</p>
<p>Women's Temperance Association Resolution</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association held its first autumn board meeting at 23 Yuanmingyuan Road yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. After discussion, the temporary motion by Mrs. Mao Wang Ruizhu and Mrs. Zheng Wei was to immediately convene an emergency meeting of Shanghai women to discuss how to deal with Japan, and to contact groups such as the Chinese Women's Political Participation Association, the Chinese Women's Relief Society, and the Chinese Women's Relief Association to send telegrams to European and American women leaders and groups to state the violence of the Japanese in the three eastern provinces, the destruction of East Asian peace, and to ask them to expand publicity in their countries and petition their governments to stop the Japanese military actions and immediately withdraw their troops stationed in China. This draft telegram has been drafted by Ms. Liu Wang Liming.</p>
<p>Hankou Citizens Do Not Want Japanese Relief Grain</p>
<p>Mr. Li of the Zhu Zi Old Tribune in Hankou sent a telegram: Due to the Shenyang Incident, the citizens of Hankou are emotional and agitated. Japanese relief grain and goods are unable to be transported to Hankou. Instead of disputes occurring later, it is better to temporarily not transport them to Hankou. If it has not yet been loaded, please unload it in Shanghai first. Sincerely, Jin.</p>
<p>Circular from Korean Organizations in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Korean Organizations in Shanghai issued a circular yesterday: (Titles omitted) That fierce owl and wolf, taking advantage of the night, moved troops, attacked cities, killed generals, and burned important towns. South from Andong, north to Hachang, east from Yan, Hun, and Wang, west to the outside of the Liao River, marching ten thousand miles, as if entering an uninhabited land. The people of the three Hans are splitting their eyes with anger, let alone your country's generals and people. When the Jin people went south, there was still a Yue Wumu, and when the Qing people attacked Ningyuan, there was still Yuan Chonghuan's heroic defense. I think today your country, which is still developing, is not the Song and Ming dynasties on the verge of collapse. The signs of Japan's collapse are already apparent, and it does not have the courage to start an era like the Jin and Qing dynasties. Moreover, attacking without declaring war is the act of a thief, and making peace without fighting is surrender. Since they are thieves, do you want to surrender to thieves? Now your country hears the drums of war in You and Yan, and exchanges jade and silk in Wu and Yue, only guarding with tranquility and relying on alliances to revive. How can you not know that alliances are the associations of robbers? Instead of suing thieves to thieves, why not kill the thieves? If you can muster the courage of a million armed forces and fight to the death as China, then the twenty million people of the three Hans will ask to be the vanguard, not hesitating to spill their liver and brains on the ground. Considering the responsibility of the China-Korea connection, I do not hesitate to say a word, hoping that your country's officials and people will recognize friends internally, resist enemies externally, unanimously fight to the death, and vow to eliminate the Japanese. Sending this telegram urgently, I cannot express what I feel. Sincerely, The Joint Association of Korean Organizations in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Tanaka's Active Policy of Aggression Towards Manchuria and Mongolia</h3>
<p>Attachment Printing must be contacted before the end of the month</p>
<p>Japan's seizure of the three eastern provinces by force this time is based on the active policy of aggression towards Manchuria and Mongolia by the Tanaka Cabinet of that country. The so-called Meiji Emperor's legacy strategy is to conquer Taiwan in the first stage, conquer Korea in the second stage, and destroy Manchuria and Mongolia in the third stage, so as to conquer all of China and make the southern seas and the entire Asian belt of different clothes fear us (Japan claims) and look up to us. This is its clear proof. This policy is divided into (1) the active policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia, (2) the territory of Manchuria and Mongolia and China, (3) the active policy towards Inner and Outer Mongolia, (4) the Korean immigration reward and protection policy, (5) the new continent development and the Manchuria and Mongolia Railway, (6) the Tongliao-Jehol railway, (7) the Taonan-Solun railway, (8) a part of the Changtao railway, (9) the Jihui Railway, (10) the national policy centered on the Jihui Line and the Sea of Japan, (11) the nature of the Jihui Road project and its incidental rights and interests, (12) the Hunchun-Hailing railway, (13) the Manchuria and Mongolia trade doctrine, (14) the construction of large shipping companies centered on Dalian, (15) the implementation of the gold standard, (16) the welcome of third-country investment in Manchuria and Mongolia, (17) the South Manchuria Railway Company must change its management, (18) the steel problem, (19) the oil problem, (20) the ammonium sulfate agricultural fertilizer and other problems, (21) the soda and soda ash business, (22) tungsten and aluminum business, (23) the necessity of establishing the Takushoku Province, (24) the Great Liu River basin, (25) the defense against Chinese immigration intrusion, (26) the independent management of hospitals and schools, etc., a total of two volumes and six chapters. All invasion policies concerning politics, military affairs, economy, culture, and transportation were previously obtained by the New Voice News Agency on the fourth floor of Daxin Fang, next to the Sanma Road Shilou Daxin Silk and Satin Bureau, and reprinted 30,000 copies, which were distributed to all walks of life. Now the agency, with Japan's implementation of the seizure of Manchuria and Mongolia, is reprinting this policy on a large scale to raise awareness. All agencies, schools, groups, and businesses, if they wish to reprint the attachment, will only be charged a paper fee of four yuan per hundred copies. They must contact the New Voice News Agency before the 30th of this month in order to compile and print them, so that they know that Japan's atrocities are a predetermined plan, not a temporary conflict.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's News of Disaster Relief in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>A Visit to the Disaster Relief Shelter</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Disaster Relief Shelter on Liuying Road, Zhabei, has been completed and is accepting people. Yesterday morning, the Bureau of Social Affairs invited representatives from all walks of life to visit, with over thirty representatives from party and government agencies, various groups, chambers of commerce, newspapers, news agencies, Chinese and Western representatives arriving. Director Pan Gongzhan personally received the visitors. The shelter occupies over thirty-nine mu of land and is divided into two main parts, front and back. The front part is for office, security, fire protection, clinics, wards, storage, supplies warehouse, and material collection rooms. The back part is the residence of the disaster victims. There are rows of sheds on the left and right, each with twenty, totaling forty. Each shed is divided into ten rooms, totaling four hundred, each room can accommodate more than ten people, totaling more than four thousand people. There are also washing and bathing rooms and toilets on both the left and right sides. Two congee meals are served daily in the morning and evening, and lunch is served. Vegetarian food is the most. Each person is given a set of single cloth shirts and pants, a set of cotton clothes and pants, and is given a cotton blanket and straw mat. One Western doctor, two nurses, and one pharmacist are hired to specialize in treatment and medication. The National Medical Association also sends two national doctors every morning and four in the afternoon to diagnose and treat them on site. In addition, the pharmaceutical industry donates medicinal materials and prescribes and decocts prescriptions. A sick ward is set up for the seriously ill to live in and receive treatment. Disaster victims can choose either Western or Chinese medicine at will. Now, as disaster victims arrive in Shanghai in an endless stream, the first shelter is not enough to accommodate them, so a second shelter is being built to its east, and a third shelter is being built on the vacant land of the Commercial Press on Song Park Road, Zhongxing Road. If all three shelters are completed, it will cost about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan to build and can accommodate more than 10,000 disaster victims. The disaster victims in the first shelter come from all over the country, with Jiangsu and Hubei being the most numerous, followed by Jiangxi, Henan, and Anhui, and Shandong and Hunan being the least. As of yesterday, the shelter had a total of two thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight men, women, and children.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Speech on Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech on disaster relief at the XBCL radio station. The speech is as follows: Everyone, today I, Xiaolai, am here to share a few points about the flood disaster with you all. As the old saying goes, "Human affairs affect below, celestial changes respond above." These words are not superstitious, nor do they mean that people have offended the heavens, and the heavens have sent down many disasters. Rather, it means that if people have adequate preparations beforehand for things like floods and droughts, then major floods and droughts will not become a reality. And even if they do become a reality, there will not be tens of thousands of victims drowning and starving to death. Therefore, we have an ancient saying in our country, called "Human determination conquers heaven." This saying is our current motto for overcoming any difficulties. It refers to the current flood disaster. The area affected by the disaster covers seventeen provinces, accounting for one-third of the country's land. There are more than 70 million victims, accounting for one-sixth of the country's population. This has become an extremely serious situation. However, compatriots across the country should remember several historical events in our country. During the time of Emperor Yao, there was a seven-year flood. During the time of Cheng Tang, there was a nine-year drought. But the people at that time did not suffer any major pain. Why is that? Because they were able to prevent disasters beforehand and had adequate remedies afterward. Everyone, imagine that at that time, science was not developed, and transportation was not as convenient as it is now, yet they could still achieve this. Therefore, we now have no fear of not having a solution for such a large flood disaster, but we are afraid that our compatriots across the country who have not been affected by the disaster cannot make a great determination and have sustained efforts. Now, looking at newspapers everywhere, everyone is doing their best for this fundraising effort. There is government relief, group advocacy, newspaper publicity, business profit sharing, and individual frugality. We, who are organizing the fundraising, cannot help but express our deepest gratitude. However, this year's disaster is so large, and there are so many victims, that it is unlikely that the victims can survive by getting through just the next three months of autumn and one winter. Perhaps this relief effort will need to be carried out for a year. Therefore, those who are helping with the relief now need to have a long-term plan, carefully considering their personal income. If a person saves one-tenth or one-twentieth of their monthly income, it is best to temporarily stop saving for the year and use it for monthly disaster relief for the victims. If they have not been saving, then a person's social expenses, cigarettes, and other consumption expenses, more or less, are inevitable. Temporarily stop these social and consumption expenses for the year and use them for monthly disaster relief for the victims. That way, this relief effort will not run out of resources. This is what I have to say to our compatriots across the country who have not been affected by the disaster. Furthermore, we need to plan for the aftermath of the disaster area. The scope of this planning is very large. First, floods and droughts are completely different. After the floodwaters recede, farmers need capital to sow the wheat for the coming year. Merchants want to restore their previous business. Not only have most of the goods they had stored been washed away by the flood, but they also need to purchase new goods. Where will the capital come from? Moreover, there are also debts that are due, and they are being pressed for payment. Organizing disaster relief is already extremely complicated. Talking about the aftermath of the disaster area is even more complex. But if we are afraid of the trouble and do not think of a way to deal with the aftermath of the disaster area, then we do not know how many years this relief effort will need to be carried out before it is completed. Therefore, I, Xiaolai, have a suggestion. When debts are due, we should follow the example of Japan during the Great Earthquake, where commercial organizations in various places, based on local conditions, discussed a proper method of extending the repayment period that would take care of all parties. The capital for stores to resume business will need to rely on the assistance of the banking industry. However, the banking industry in the disaster-stricken areas has suffered such great damage from the flood that it is feared that they will not have much strength. Therefore, for this matter, we cannot but hope that the banking industry outside the disaster area will provide some appropriate assistance to the banking industry within the disaster area. Also, for the capital for farmers to replant winter wheat, I, Xiaolai, believe that we should take two measures. The first is to take a few percent from the relief funds specifically for this purpose. The second is to take 10 million or 5 million from the disaster relief bonds issued by the government and establish farmers' banks in the disaster area to lend to farmers, using the farmers' land as collateral for the loan. This is what I hope all businesses across the country will come together to think of a solution for. There is also the issue of food relief. The surplus grain in the Northeast can subsidize the food supply for the people in our disaster areas. Everyone knows this. A few days ago, the Chamber of Commerce also sent a telegram to the government about this. However, there are still some people who are carefully considering whether the surplus grain in the Northeast can be sold to us on credit in installments, given the financial resources of the Northeast. In fact, this is not a problem. As soon as the floodwaters recede, according to what I, Xiaolai, just said, we can enable them to resume business. At least 20 million people will not need the government to issue rations by name. We are only afraid that this year's fields will have no harvest and there will be no food to buy. Therefore, I dare say that half of the surplus grain in the Northeast is to be used to relieve these people. As for the remaining one or two million people, if they are not given rations by name, they really do not have the ability to buy food themselves. Then, according to what Mr. Lei Yin of the Shishi Xinbao said on the 7th, the official banks of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces should first pay for the price of wheat and flour, and then the government should repay half in cash and half with disaster relief bonds. It is not an impassable matter. I hope that the disaster relief organizations will all stand up and advocate for this matter. The last thing I want to say is about water conservancy. In fact, what we are talking about now is not really water conservancy, but flood prevention. This time, let's not talk about other places. Just take the lower reaches of the Huai River in Yangzhou as an example. According to the announcement by the local party headquarters and the appeals of the mass organizations, they all say that there were not sufficient preparations for flood prevention materials beforehand. When the incident happened, the flood prevention personnel all ran away. Therefore, this matter really should be attributed to poor human planning. It is exactly in line with the ancient saying, "Human affairs affect below, celestial changes respond above." I, Xiaolai, remember that during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, the Yellow River breached its banks in Zhengzhou. It took more than 13 million taels of silver to close the breach. At that time, the country's total income was only 70 million taels per year. The funds used for the flood disaster accounted for almost one-fifth of the total annual income. This shows that they were able to pay attention to the situation of river defense. Furthermore, in the Qing Dynasty, the punishment for those responsible for river defense incidents was very severe. We can see from the Donghua Records and private collections of the time that if the Governor-General of the River Conservancy had a major flood in his area, the heavier punishment would be dismissal from office and exile, and the lighter punishment would be to wear a cangue and be displayed to the public on the riverbank. For a senior official to be punished with a cangue and displayed to the public, its effect on punishing derelict personnel was really no less than dismissal from office and exile. Therefore, although the politics of the Qing Dynasty were corrupt, this aspect is indeed worthy of our attention. I, Xiaolai, feel that flood prevention projects are more important than anything else in the future. But there are two prerequisites. First, there must be sufficient funding. Second, there must be strict assessments of river defense personnel at all times, so that these people do not take the lives of our people as a child's play. Everyone needs to stand up and make appropriate suggestions to the government on this matter. I, Xiaolai, have finished what I wanted to say. However, this time, it is not ordinary charitable disaster relief, but disaster relief to save the country and save the nation. Please everyone unite to show the bloody heart of us Chinese people who love our compatriots, love our country, and love our nation.</p>
<p>China International Famine Relief Commission</p>
<h3>Report on Inspection of Wuhu Disaster Situation</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu Jisheng, Vice President of the China International Famine Relief Commission, previously went to Wuhu with Mr. Lu Bohong as a representative and Mr. Ning Songquan to inspect the flood situation. He returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Gu's on-the-spot inspection, the disaster situation in Wuhu is very severe, no less than that in Hankou and Jiangbei. The area has been flooded since July 20, and it has been two months now, and it is increasing every day. Recently, the water level in various places has gradually decreased, but Wuhu has not decreased. Currently, the prosperous areas are submerged by two or three feet at the lower end, and five or six feet at the higher end. In the remote areas, the highest point is about twelve feet. The water color is black and bluish, and there are fears of epidemics. As for the residents in the water, their feet are mostly swollen due to the mixed tides. Mr. Gu and others, accompanied by Magistrate Yu and Zhao, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, traveled by small boat for 120 li. It was a vast expanse of water. The embankment had collapsed completely, and there was no trace to be found. The boat traveled for an hour, and no human trace was seen. Only on the top of a small mountain did they see some refugees. At first, there were not many. The boat carried large steamed buns, which were scattered on the mountain. Unexpectedly, in an instant, the victims hiding in the mountain gully came one after another, gathering hundreds of people. Among them, children without a thread of clothing were everywhere. These victims have been starving for a long time, and cold is out of the question. Fortunately, the weather is still warm now. If it turns cold, they will either die of hunger or of cold. The victims who fled to the roofs of houses and tree tops were calling out for help, but no one responded. They could only sit and wait for death. Mr. Gu, Magistrate Yu, and Director Zhao and others were heartbroken at the sight. Ning Songquan is a businessman who runs a Yongfengyu Cloth Shop in Wuhu, so he often travels between Wuhu and Shanghai. Witnessing the severity of the disaster, he volunteered to donate all his possessions to help the victims. He makes 20,000 large steamed buns every day and distributes them to the victims. He has been doing this for more than 50 days. It can be said that no less than 250,000 victims have prolonged their lives by eating his steamed buns. He is truly enthusiastic. His colleagues in the shop, Xie Shikun, Ruan Dezhong, Cao Youbai, and others, are also very enthusiastic in handling the relief efforts. However, Mr. Ning is not a very wealthy person, and it will be difficult for him to continue. It is truly worrying. There are very few disaster relief agencies in the area. Therefore, Mr. Gu has negotiated with local gentry and merchants, Tao Yutang and Wei Binchen, as well as Western missionary Mr. Pu, to form a branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission to start disaster relief. Wuhu is currently preparing for this. Mr. Gu has returned to the commission to report and it is set to have a meeting today to discuss how to proceed with the plans.</p>
<h3>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>A Letter on Surveying the Disaster in Wujiang: The disaster situation in Wujiang was previously surveyed by Mr. Wu Lingxiao at the request of the association. Here is the reply letter (some omitted above). I investigated the area from outside the North Gate of Wujiang, along the shore of Pangshan Lake, to Hengdang, a distance of more than 50 li. It was a vast expanse of water. All that could be seen were ruined houses and dilapidated walls, with willows drooping all around. Victims were taking refuge on graves and high mounds, crying out in hunger and cold. It was as if one were in a vast sea of waves, no longer knowing that the boat was traveling through 100,000 mu of fertile farmland. The fields along the lake in Damao Port, Wu Lou, and Zhenze were connected to the lake water. Even the higher fields were half-submerged. Mulberry trees were also occasionally submerged in the water. Mei Yan and Pingwang are a little farther from the lake, but the fields are low-lying. The rain god and the wind god successively wreaked havoc, resulting in a strange disaster. Even the higher ground has seen a sharp reduction in harvests. Since the continuous rain for many days, followed by repeated torrential rains, the fields along the lake have been submerged for more than half of the area. On the 25th and 26th days of the eighth month, there were several days of hurricanes, and the lake water suddenly rose by five or six feet. The frightening waves were like thunder and lightning. More than 50 people who were trying to save their property were swept into the water. Houses, huts, livestock, grain, clothing, and other belongings were swept away. The embankments, which were several feet wide and seven or eight feet high, collapsed almost entirely. The victims were sleeping in the open, without clothes or food. There were about seven or eight thousand people. There were many cases of people living in houses that were in the water and could not be moved. This year, the rain occurred every ten days or so. For the sake of the autumn harvest, farmers and business owners borrowed money to pump water, buy bamboo and wood, and nail piles on the embankments to prevent collapse. However, they were eventually destroyed by the hurricane, and there was no harvest. The tens of thousands of gold spent on rescue efforts were washed away by the wind and waves. This is something that has never happened in previous famines. It is estimated that more than 300,000 mu of farmland in Wujiang have been protected from the water and can hopefully yield a 50% harvest. About 170,000 to 180,000 mu have been protected but yielded no harvest. And more than 100,000 mu along the lake have had their embankments collapse and their dikes breached, becoming one with Tai Lake. Those who cultivated this land have become starving people. They cannot survive without immediate relief. Winter is coming soon, and the north wind is biting. We cannot but urgently seek food and clothing from your association. It is estimated that more than 25,000 people will be waiting for relief to survive the winter. More than 100,000 mu of farmland have been mostly destroyed. If repairs are not made, farmers will lose their jobs. In the future, we will have to seek assistance from your association to organize public works relief (some omitted below).</p>
<p>The Water Level in Luhe Rose Again After Receding. The association recently received a letter from Hong Kangxie, the magistrate of Luhe County, which reads: I am writing to inform you that our county has suffered a major flood this year, which has been reported in telegrams. Luhe is located in Jiangbei, connected to the Chu River in the north and the Yangtze River in the south. All the accumulated water has no place to drain other than the Yangtze River. However, the Yangtze River is full of tides, making drainage difficult. According to statistics, the water level has only dropped by three feet in more than two months. Unexpectedly, during the recent tide period, autumn rain continued to fall non-stop for a day and a night. The sky and the ground were wet, and the water level rose by more than eight inches again. It seems that after receding, it will rise again, with no end in sight. In the blink of an eye, the wheat planting season is approaching. If the water is difficult to recede and there is no ability to sow seeds, it is not only worrying that this year's harvest will be bad, but also that there will be another major loss if the wheat planting season is missed. Thinking of this, I am extremely anxious. I am writing this letter to inform you and hope that you will investigate and provide relief as soon as possible to benefit the victims. With utmost anticipation, I address this to the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association.</p>

<p>Employee of Hu Qingyutang</p>
<h3>Qian Huaiting Drowned Himself in the Sea</h3>
<p>Deep Resentment Between Husband and Wife</p>
<p>The Corpse Was Retrieved by the Life Saving Bureau</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at about 10:00 AM, a male corpse was found floating in the Huangpu River, south of the Guanchuan at Map Taiwan No. 39, Wusong. He had a monk's head, a long face, and was wearing a dark blue spring-lined short jacket with a white cloth shirt underneath, bone buttons, and gray serge-lined trousers with white calico shorts underneath. He had a leather belt around his waist, white cotton socks, and gray serge leather-soled shoes. After the body was found, it was retrieved by a patrol boat from the Wusong Life Saving Bureau at about 10:00 AM and brought back to the bureau's dock. Only a copper coin was found on the body, and there were no other belongings. Photos were taken and arrangements were being made to provide a coffin and burial services. At that time, Zhou Yunfu, an employee of Hu Qingyutang Pharmacy on Beijing Road in Shanghai, arrived in Wusong and reported to the Life Saving Bureau that his colleague Qian Huaiting had committed suicide by drowning and asked them to pay attention. The bureau sent someone to accompany him to the dock to identify the body. It was confirmed that it was Qian's corpse. Qian Huaiting, the deceased, was 26 years old, from Zhuji. He was an employee of Hu Qingyutang. His family lived at No. 41, Beixing Lane, North Nicheng Bridge. His wife, Wang, was 25 years old and had two sons, the elder three years old and the younger just over a month old. Qian was usually very prudent and taciturn, but his income was very low, and life was quite difficult. Therefore, he often had disagreements with his wife Wang, which made Qian unhappy. Recently, the couple had a dispute over family matters, and Qian developed a pessimistic view of life. At about 1:00 PM on the 19th of this month, he left home with a silk long gown. On the same day, Qian's colleague Zhou Yunfu and others from Hu Qingyutang received a letter from Qian, which said that he owed some debts and asked his brothers to repay them on his behalf after the year-end bonus. The colleagues were very alarmed after reading the letter and immediately searched everywhere, but there was no trace of him. At about 6:00 PM, they went to Qian's home to inquire. At that time, Qian's wife Wang also received a letter from Qian, which said that since they had been married, the relationship between them had not been good, like water and fire. Living together was meaningless. Rather than living together, it was better to sacrifice himself to avoid delaying Wang's youth. He had committed suicide by drowning on the Ningxing Steamer today. Wang and Qian's colleagues were extremely shocked and immediately sent someone to the Sanbei Company Wharf, hoping to persuade Qian to come back. Unfortunately, the Ningxing Steamer had already departed, so there was no way to save him. However, Qian's wife and colleagues still hoped that he would not commit suicide, as there was no confirmation. They continued to search everywhere. Until yesterday morning (the 22nd), the Ningxing Steamer sailed from Ningbo and arrived in Shanghai. Qian's colleagues immediately went to inquire about the ship. It was learned that Qian had boarded the ship on the 19th when it sailed to Ningbo and asked the tea boy to take a jacket to the nearby pawnshop to get money to buy a ticket. When the ship sailed to the mouth of Wusong, Qian went to the deck and jumped into the sea to drown himself. After learning of this bad news, Zhou Yunfu went to Wusong to report to the Life Saving Bureau. After Zhou confirmed that it was Qian's corpse, he hurried back to Shanghai to report to Qian's wife. Because Qian left no property behind, Hu Qingyutang paid for the clothing and coffin. Yesterday afternoon, Qian's colleagues accompanied Wang to Wusong to collect the body. When the coffin was being prepared, Qian's wife cried loudly while holding the coffin, and many of his colleagues shed tears. It was a tragic scene. The coffin is temporarily placed at the Wusong Siming Public Hall and will be transported back to his hometown for burial at a later date.</p>
<p>Wife of Yin Wenlong</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Against Airline</h3>
<p>Besides Claiming Funeral Expenses</p>
<p>Losses Exceeding Seven Hundred Dollars</p>
<p>Dispute Over Responsibility Issue</p>
<p>Court Adjourns to Announce Verdict on the 29th</p>
<p>Yin Wenlong, a compradore for the Hankou Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co., specially returned to Shanghai last winter because his wife, Sun Yuefang, was giving birth in Shanghai. Subsequently, on December 9th, he boarded China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai No. 2 aircraft to Hankou. Unexpectedly, shortly after takeoff, the plane crashed, causing serious injuries and death to all passengers and the pilot. Yin was among the deceased. Later, his wife, Sun, negotiated with the airline, demanding compensation for losses. Because the company firmly refused, she filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court. After repeated summonses and hearings, the court instructed both parties to reach a settlement, as previously reported. However, the airline consistently maintained that the accident was beyond human control and that it should not be held responsible for the passengers' losses. Therefore, a settlement proved difficult. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Mo held a continued hearing. First, the defendant's lawyer presented documents, stating that these were letters of certification proving that the pilot, Bell, had flying experience, as well as Bell's resume. Subsequently, a Mr. Yao, a ticket seller from the airline's sales department, testified about Yin Wenlong's ticket purchase. He stated that Yin had purchased a ticket on December 3rd for the 4th from Shanghai to Nanjing. Because he still had a round-trip ticket from Nanjing to Hankou, he reminded Yin to pay attention to the passenger regulations printed on the back of the ticket and instructed him to sign the purchased ticket. At that time, Yin stated that he feared he might not be able to travel the next day and that it would be inconvenient to sign the ticket in advance, so he decided to sign it when he departed. Yin also said that he had flown before and was very familiar with the regulations on the back of the ticket. Although he did not sign the ticket, he verbally acknowledged them. On the 4th, Yin did not go and informed the company that he would postpone his trip until the 9th, when he boarded the Shanghai aircraft. According to regulations, the ticket inspector must verify the ticket before the passenger boards the plane. However, on that day, due to time constraints, the ticket inspector did not have time to ask Yin to sign the ticket, so he would have to sign it upon arrival at his destination. This was why Yin's ticket was not signed. Next, the plaintiff's lawyer presented a letter from the manager of Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. in Hankou, proving Yin Wenlong's monthly salary and annual commissions during his lifetime. Then, arguments began. First, the plaintiff's lawyer, Liu Shifang, spoke, stating that if the defendant argued that Article 654 of the Civil Code could not be invoked in this case, then it should present a special law. Since there was no special law, the Civil Code should naturally apply. The court should not refuse to hear the case simply because there was no explicit provision. The defendant also argued that the airline was a state-established entity, but its nature was different from other state-owned transportation agencies. The contract signed with the United States stated that it was a limited liability company operating in accordance with the laws of the Republic of China, and its jurisdiction was controlled by the board of directors. If it were state-owned, it would naturally be managed by the Ministry of Communications. Since the deceased did not sign the ticket, he was not bound by the regulations on the back of the ticket. The claims being pursued include funeral expenses, which are documented, and losses exceeding 70,000 yuan, which were estimated by the insurance company based on the deceased's lifetime income and the plaintiff's future life expectancy. If the court considers the calculation to be inaccurate, then it should be re-evaluated. Next, the defendant's lawyer, Li Zuyu, replied, first stating that the accident was caused by force majeure. Second, he said that the Civil Code's provisions for passenger carriers did not include aviation. It was inappropriate for the plaintiff to impose the responsibility of a passenger carrier on the company. Moreover, Yin Wenlong had verbally acknowledged the regulations on the ticket when he purchased it, so the company was not liable for the accident. Finally, he stated that the key point of the case was to resolve the issue of responsibility first. If the company was not held responsible, then the losses claimed by the plaintiff would not be valid. Therefore, the defendant requested a preliminary judgment first. Judge Li then announced the end of the arguments and adjourned the hearing until the morning of September 29th for the verdict.</p>

<h3>Anhui Relief Association Banquet for Calligraphers and Painters Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anhui Flood Relief Association held a public banquet at Taolechun on Sanma Road at 7 PM the night before last for famous calligraphers and painters in Shanghai, requesting donations for flood relief in the province. Huang Binhong, Hong Yansheng, and Wang Yingbin presided over the meeting, with dozens of famous calligraphers and painters attending.

The exhibition will be full of treasures and will be a great spectacle.</p>
<h3>Autumn Calibration of Measures in the Rice Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Industry Rengu Guild and various businesses held an autumn calibration of measures at the Cuixiu Hall of the City God Temple on the previous two days. The guild notified businesses in the north and south to bring their measures for calibration and invited leaders from various rice industry guilds, associations, and groups to supervise. Ye Huijun, chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Guild, Zhu Zixiang, chairman of the Rice Shop Guild, Yan Xiaoquan, chairman of the Southern Rice Merchant Guild, and leaders of the Changxi Public Office, as well as rice merchants, attended. Twenty measurers were selected to calibrate the measures. When each measure was calibrated, the leaders present verified it. If it was accurate, the Rengu Guild and the Southern and Northern Public Guilds would affix a calibration certificate to the measure and brand it with the words "Autumn 20th Year". To ensure that boatmen knew the secret mark of the brand, rice merchants notified them. It is reported that more than 600 measures were calibrated in the two days, which is more than 100 fewer than in previous seasons. This is because wharves have been built in both the northern and southern markets, allowing rice boats to dock at the wharves and gather in one place, making it easier for businesses to measure rice. Therefore, the number of measures used by businesses has decreased.</p>
<h3>Romanian Crimes</h3>
<p>Theft and Morphine Trafficking</p>
<p>At around 10 AM the day before yesterday, two Romanians, Boarnsky and Kovsmenko, went to a bookstore on Haig Road in western Shanghai to buy books worth several dollars. They took out a ten-dollar bill to get change. The shop assistant gave them a five-dollar bill. The Romanians claimed that the bill was not usable in the market and asked to exchange it, wanting to choose the bill themselves. The shop assistant took out a stack of bills for the Romanians to choose from, and they took one bill and left with the books. The shop assistant then discovered that seventeen and a half dollars were missing from the bills. Knowing that the Romanians had stolen them, he followed them and saw them enter a house at 3 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. He immediately reported this to the Jing'an Temple police station. The head of the police station immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest the two men at the address, along with detectives from the French Concession police station. However, Bo and Kov had already left. The detectives waited at the house, and at around 4 PM, a Romanian named A. Drigin, 25, entered the house looking for Boarnsky. The Chinese and foreign detectives, seeing that he looked suspicious, arrested him. After questioning, they learned that he lived at No. 1 Jing'an Villa. They took him to his home to search it and found a suitcase containing eleven tins of morphine. He was taken to the police station along with his wife, A. Mursina, also Romanian, 24 years old, and they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, Tregan and his wife were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. According to the police station lawyer Wang Yaotang, Boarnsky and Kovsmenko were arrested by detectives from the French Concession police station on Broadway last night because they were also involved in a case in the French Concession. Therefore, they are currently detained at the French Concession police station. He requested that the court send a letter to the Second Special Court to transfer Bo and the others to this case. The confiscated morphine had also been subjected to an unofficial chemical test. The test results showed that only the top layer of each tin was morphine, while the bottom was mixed with valueless white powder and falsely labeled with German company brands. It was necessary to send it to the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department for an official chemical test and requested a postponement. The morphine was presented to the court. When questioned, the defendants claimed that the morphine had been deposited with them by two Germans, Beto, and that they knew nothing else. They stated that they went to the French Concession to visit Boarnsky to collect seven dollars in gambling debts. After Judge Feng Shide verified their statements, he ordered that the two defendants be remanded in custody and that a letter be sent to the Second Special District Court at a later date to transfer Boarnsky and Kovsmenko for further questioning.</p>

<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<h3>Mr. Shen Gengyao's Question (On Methods of Saving the Country and Dealing with Japan)</h3>
<p>Now that national disaster has arrived, how should we save China? This is a very serious and urgent question. The following points are explained for guidance: (1) What attitude should our people take towards Japan in their current position? (2) (Omitted) (3) In China's current crisis of survival, why do people still hold a numb and indifferent attitude? (4) Now that there are many people who want to serve the country because of emotional excitement, how can one be considered serving the country and serving society? Can I be considered serving society as a shop apprentice?</p>
<p>(Reply) The people of our country who have a little knowledge and a little bloodiness will naturally be angry at the unprecedented atrocities that Japan has inflicted on our Northeast. However, fighting Japan desperately is only a temporary emotion and impulse, and it is useless. This full of grief, determination, excitement, and passion must be melted, united, and expanded with calm and calm thought, precise and lasting organization and planning, and proceeded in an effective direction. How can it be effective? Everyone must be prepared to sacrifice, but we must sacrifice in valuable and effective actions. Speaking from the position of our people, what can be done:</p>
<p>First, you must get your own body in good shape before you can talk about sacrifice. Everyone must train individually, and they must also receive public training. Regardless of agriculture, industry, commerce, or academic institutions, they must find ways to provide opportunities for group training. When there are no opportunities for group training, first gather comrades and practice regularly.</p>
<p>Second, make a big determination not to use Japanese goods. We don't need to talk about boycotting Japanese goods eight times. One time without success, please see that Britain's national power is considered powerful. India's Gandhi can soften them. How much ability does Gandhi have? The most powerful thing is to promote the non-use of British goods, especially the fact that he wears Indian homespun cloth in the Indian Governor's Yamen and the British Prime Minister's Yamen. Now, in Japan, just the value of cotton cloth accounts for 70% of the total foreign imports, almost 200 million yuan. The products of Japanese yarn factories in China also amount to almost 200 million yuan. If we all agree not to buy it, this one item will be enough to strangle them. What's more, at the same time, all kinds of things are not used. The reason why the boycott was ineffective in the past is that there was no power from the masses. Despite singing high praises for the boycott, no one was willing to be Gandhi. If everyone is determined to be Gandhi now, are we still afraid of being ineffective?</p>
<p>Third, pay great attention to studying the Northeast problem and the Japanese problem. Maps, books, newspapers, and magazines, anything about the Northeast, should be collected as much as possible and studied carefully. The 92-year-old Mr. Ma Xiangbo said, "To save China, first save the Northeast; to save the Northeast, first know the Northeast."</p>
<p>As for your current job, it is not only directly serving society, but also indirectly serving the country. Because to strengthen the country, you must first enrich the country. Striving to increase production and develop the social economy is simply the fundamental plan to save the country. In the current period of resisting Japan and saving the country, we should work even harder. Look at Germany after the Great War. The workers automatically increased their working hours by one hour every day, so they restored national power so quickly. The fourth point is not a problem.</p>
<p>But the second question should not be said like this. If someone says that, you should strictly correct him. It is not necessarily true that you say that the people of the country are numb and indifferent. Look at how much the people's spirit has been promoted in various places these days, so the third point is also not a problem.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit over Dancer Being Splattered with Feces</h3>
<p>Ge Chongxi Did Not Attend Due to Illness</p>
<p>Dancer Demands 1,000 Yuan in Compensation</p>
<p>Sun Aiying, a dancer currently working at the Da Hu dance hall in Jing'an Temple, recently hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Ge Chongxi, the manager of the Paris dance hall, for assault and insult. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiexun presided over the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. The defendant, Ge Chongxi, claimed to be ill and did not attend. Lawyer Jiang Baolian attended court as his agent and requested a postponement to prepare for the defense. The plaintiff, Sun Aiying, along with witnesses Wang Xiuying and Chen Huiying and her agent lawyer Yuan Yang'an, appeared in court. Sun Aiying stated the reasons for the lawsuit, saying: "I used to work as a dancer at the Paris dance hall. After my contract expired, I left Paris and accepted a job at the Da Hu dance hall. Two other dancers from Paris, Tu Xiuying and Chen Huiying, also accepted jobs at Da Hu at the same time. The defendant, as the manager of Paris, hated me for leaving and vowed to make things difficult for me. Then, on the evening of the 12th, I hired a car from my residence on Dagu Road to Da Hu. When I passed the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Ma Huo Road, four thugs suddenly stopped the car and threw the filthy feces contained in cigarette boxes at my head. They also snatched a embroidered scarf and a jade brooch. The patrolmen investigated, arrested three people, and one person escaped. After taking them to the police station, it was learned that the three people, Zhou Fulin, Shao Genfa, and Ye Zixiang, were invited by the fugitive Zhou Degong. Zhou was instigated by Ge Chongxi, the manager of Paris, and each received five yuan. Qiu Genfa used to be a tea server in Paris, so they knew each other. Now I am accusing Ge of instigating insult and injury, please punish him according to the law, and please compensate for the stolen items and mental damage, totaling 1,000 yuan." Witnesses Wang Xiuying and Chen Huiying testified that they used to be dancers in Paris and left at the same time as Sun to join the Da Hu dance hall. When they left, Ge Chongxi, the manager of Paris, expressed dissatisfaction and said that Sun Aiying should be harmed. However, they did not witness the incident that day. Detective Yang Yunfeng stated the situation of the investigation at that time, but did not provide evidence that Ge instigated the crime when he was interrogated in the police station. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Yuan, immediately stood up and stated that this point was clarified in the minutes of the last court hearing and requested an investigation. Judge Xiao adjourned the case to be heard again on the afternoon of the 26th of this month.</p>

<h3>Termination of Engagement of Female Telephone Bureau Employee</h3>
<p>Hu Huiming, a female operator at the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, is at the prime of her youth and a modern woman. When Hu was 14 years old, her parents arranged for her to marry Sheng Boli, a local man. At that time, Hu was still a child and knew nothing about marriage. Now that Hu is older and wiser, she has learned that her fiancé has not received proper education and has no proper occupation. He also suffers from eye disease. Although he is currently employed at the Yangzhou Christian Gospel Church, his monthly salary is only twenty yuan, which is two-thirds less than her own monthly income. Such a small amount cannot support a family, and she did not agree to the marriage. Therefore, she proposed to terminate the engagement, but Sheng refused. Hu then sued the First Special District Court, requesting permission to terminate the engagement. The Special Court has concluded the interrogation. As reported in this newspaper, Zhou Daren, the presiding judge of the Civil Court, announced the verdict yesterday morning. The main text of the verdict stated that the engagement between the two parties should be terminated, and the litigation costs of this trial should be borne by the defendant.</p>

The scene of the Flood Relief Amusement Fair features speeches by Mr. Zhu Ziqiao and Mr. Wang Xiaolai. The script of the film was conceived by Shao Zuiweng and written by Yao Sufeng, and was thoroughly discussed by well-known figures in the literary and artistic circles. The plot is tortuous and beautiful. It is said that it will be screened soon.</p>
<h3>Wuzhou Supplements Selling Well in Autumn</h3>

Now that it is autumn, taking self-coming blood to replenish blood and strengthen the body is most effective. Therefore, the company's product has been selling very well recently. Businesses in other cities have also been sending letters to purchase in bulk, and the demand is greater than the supply. The company's other major tonics, such as malt extract cod liver oil and glycerin phosphate rice, are also used by people in the society.</p>
<h3>Dr. Shen Starts His Practice, Bringing Spring Back to Life</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Qiangfu, whose ancestral home is in Wulin, has traveled extensively throughout various provinces, holding important military and political positions. He has studied medicine deeply and mastered its essence, saving countless lives. Due to weariness with his official career, he has retired to Shanghai. Prominent figures in Shanghai, including Mr. Wang Yiting, Zhang Xiaolin, Qu Wenliu, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Bin'yan, Wang Tayuan, Yuan Ludeng, Yu Yefeng, and Yao Mulian, have specially signed a letter of introduction, inviting him to set up his practice and provide medical consultations. The previous night, the wife of Mr. Zhu Buqing, a clerk at the Special District Local Court, suddenly suffered from acute cholera-like symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and severe abdominal pain. She was in great agony. Dr. Shen was urgently called to examine and treat her. Dr. Shen stated that she was suffering from the effects of the rising and falling of damp-heat energy, leading to a disruption of Yin and Yang. He immediately prescribed a formula, instructing the patient to take it quickly. Before long, her illness was greatly reduced, and the next day, her ailment had vanished. Dr. Shen is now practicing at the Dayi Public Residence on Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession and is dedicated to providing medical care without regard to poverty. Those suffering from illness should not miss this opportunity.</p>

<h3>The Nobel Prize Drenched in Blood</h3>
<p>What is the Nobel Prize? No one in academic circles is unaware of it. Its value is forty thousand US dollars per prize. Five prizes are awarded annually, totaling two hundred thousand US dollars. These five prizes are awarded to individuals who have made the most significant contributions in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and world peace during the year. The prize money comes from the interest generated by eight million four hundred thousand US dollars, which was earned by Nobel throughout his life from manufacturing powerful explosives and smokeless gunpowder.</p>
<p>Alfred Bernhard Nobel, a Swede, was born in 1833 and died in 1896. From the age of seventeen, he assisted his father in manufacturing nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin barrels were filled with sand. Seven years later, some nitroglycerin accidentally leaked into the sand, giving him a crucial idea. After repeated experiments, he finally created dynamite using 75% nitroglycerin and 25% kieselguhr. This happened in 1867. Later, he replaced kieselguhr with cork, making it even safer. A few years later, he used collodion to treat wounds. Collodion is produced by dissolving guncotton in ether. He accidentally poured leftover collodion from a bottle into nitroglycerin, resulting in the surprising creation of blasting gelatin in 1876. This is what the world calls double-strength dynamite. He invented many types of explosives, including military smokeless gunpowder, and obtained 129 patents. His eight million four hundred thousand US dollars came from this.</p>
<p>Initially, his motivation for manufacturing explosives was solely for quarrying purposes. Later, tempted by the government, Nobel did not hesitate to compromise his dignity as a scientist and create deadly weapons for the military. The establishment of the Peace Prize was an expression of Nobel's repentance in his later years. Laying down the butcher knife and becoming a Buddha on the spot, we should certainly express considerable respect for his change of heart. However, the people killed in the past are not the people saved today, and who dares to say that the people saved today will not be killed in the future? The power to determine the life and death of humanity is truly in the hands of scientists. Using science to nurture people instead of killing people is the duty of scientists. If one studies science with the intention of killing, then one is the greatest evildoer in the world. Nobel's repentance is evident to all. His annual blood-soaked prize serves as a warning bell for young scientists. How can we turn a deaf ear to it? If one's eyes are only focused on the forty thousand gold dollars, is that not utterly foolish?</p>
<h3>A Word of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>If a person had a healthy body and a secret to guaranteed success, he would surely become a dullard incapable of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness.</p>
<p>A person's intelligence is not measured by the abundance of their experience but by the degree of their ability to acquire experience.</p>
<p>The acquisition of experience is purely based on knowledge. Experience is the mother of success, and knowledge is the father of success. Both are indispensable.</p>
<p>What the world calls greatness is what religion calls holiness. Both are things that can be hoped for but not attained.</p>
<p>First love between a man and a woman is a combination of curiosity and foolishness.</p>
<p>What is life? It is nothing more than constantly cutting open one's soul to exchange it for worthless things.</p>
<p>Put the time of mourning and the effort of silent prayer into work, and China will have a day of revitalization.</p>
<p>If humans did not have the psychology of worshiping idols, there would no longer be specialized technical talents in the world.</p>
<h3>Excerpts from Lectures</h3>
<p>— Zhou Cailiang</p>
<p>Recently, there has been much talk about scientific management in our country. This is because neither production nor consumption can be discussed in economic terms without it. Recently, the Shanghai Chinese Vocational Education Society, recognizing the needs of society, established a Department of Industrial and Business Management. The other day, they specially invited Mr. Cao Yunxiang, the former president of Tsinghua University, to the school to lecture on "Personnel Management Issues." His profound insights and apt metaphors were fully expressed. His words are worthy of reference for society, so I have recorded them below.</p>
<p>Since the National Government promulgated and implemented the Factory Law, most capitalists have been greatly alarmed because they feel their own knowledge is insufficient and are eager to recruit talent to help them. What you are learning today can be said to be exactly what is needed. It goes without saying that after graduation, your career prospects will be bright. However, what I want to tell you today are the various practical problems that urgently need to be solved. For example, a certain bank where my friend Mr. Dai works suddenly had a female employee who repeatedly requested sick leave five or six months ago and did not return for a long time. After repeated investigations by a certain gentleman from the personnel management department of the bank, the truth gradually became clear. The family of the woman in question was very simple, with only an elderly mother in her sixties living with her. An older sister had already married. The woman felt that she still had no home to go to and was saddened by the thought of who her mother would rely on. She became extremely depressed, which led to her illness. When she was ill, there were many consolations, and she felt happy spiritually. The investigator, knowing the details, reported to the bank manager, who ordered the mother to accompany her on trips to various places to relieve her boredom. As a result, she recovered from her illness and returned to work, as diligent as ever. From this, it can be seen that the way to care for people cannot be overlooked.</p>
<h3>My Views on Disaster Relief Work</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai newspapers of September 19th reported that the Shanghai Disaster Relief Office announced to the city's industrial and commercial sectors: "This office has taken in over three thousand male and female disaster victims from northern Jiangsu, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. They are fed every day but have nothing to do, which is not appropriate. Setting up factories would be too expensive, and we do not have the resources at the moment. Therefore, we are publishing this notice, appealing to the industrial and commercial sectors to show compassion for the disaster victims who have lost their jobs and homes. If you have any work that requires labor, please share it with the disaster victims to help them." I believe that if this strategy can be implemented, it would indeed be the best way to solve the problem. However, whether it can be implemented depends first on allaying employers' concerns. Then, not only can the industrial and commercial sectors accommodate them, but even households needing to hire workers would not need to hire through brokers. Large households in Shanghai often employ more people than they have family members. They provide food and lodging and pay generous wages, enough for a comfortable living with surplus. If residents of the city need any workers, they should specify the origin, gender, and approximate age required, as well as the type of work skills needed and the monthly wage, and send a letter of inquiry to the Disaster Relief Office. It is expected that among the three thousand people, many will assess their capabilities and volunteer. The office would then select them, register them in order, categorize them according to their work skills, inquire about the addresses of relatives, and record them in the remarks column. They would then issue a letter of introduction, provide clean clothing and bedding, and send them to try out the work. The office would also specify the guarantee conditions on the letter of introduction for the employer. If there are any cases of theft, absconding, or illegal behavior, the office would be fully responsible. In this way, the employer would have no concerns, as the guarantee would be more reliable than that of a broker. Once they pass the trial period, they would have food, clothing, and shelter, and they could even save a portion of their wages and get insurance to secure their future. In this city of three million people in Shanghai, taking in three thousand disaster victims would be like only one person supporting one other person.</p>
<h3>In Memory of the Author of "The Sound of Silence"</h3>
<p>— Xu Xinqin</p>
<p>The French scholar Mr. Louis Laloy has studied Oriental languages for many years. He enjoys delving into ancient Chinese books, especially the theories of ancient philosophers like Lao Tzu, Zhuangzi, and Huainanzi. He is particularly interested in and well-versed in ancient Chinese music and opera. He has translated Chinese operas and authored the book "Chinese Music," which is well-known in the West. In 1914, he published the article "Huainanzi and Music" in the Dutch journal "T'oung Pao," which revealed insights that had not been previously expressed by either Chinese or Western scholars. This astonished Chinese and Western scholars of Sinology. Recently, Mr. Laloy was commissioned by the French government to come to China to investigate culture and ancient music. Before his departure, he wrote the article "The Sound of Silence" (Preface to a Visit to the Ancient Music of Divine China), published in the Parisian newspaper "Le Temps," expressing his admiration for ancient Chinese culture. Yesterday, through the introduction of the returning artist Mr. Liu Haisu and the literary critic Mr. Fu Lei, I was able to meet Mr. Laloy at Mr. Li Shizeng's villa. At that time, Mr. Chu Minyi, Mr. Li's nephew, and others invited prominent figures such as Mr. Cai Zimin, Mr. Gao Lu, and academic giants from the Chinese and French communities in Shanghai, totaling over forty people, to attend a tea party. The musicians Mr. Zheng Jinwen and professors from the Datong Music Society and the National Conservatory of Music were invited to perform ancient music suites to welcome Mr. Laloy. After listening, I was able to read Mr. Laloy's great work, "The Sound of Silence." The setting sun cast scattered shadows. Mr. Zheng then played the ancient melodies of the Two Han Passes. The night was quiet and the sounds of nature were silent. The sublime music was moving. Thoughts arose in my mind. I took up my pen to write this epilogue, expressing my feelings. I will now record Mr. Laloy's great work below.</p>
<h3>The Sound of Silence (Preface to a Visit to the Ancient Music of Divine China)</h3>
<p>— Written by Louis Laloy of France</p>
<p>This is the time of the sound of silence. To those who understand music, it is the most beautiful sound. We are shaken by the noises of the city and burdened by material things, and eagerly seek a way to refresh our minds. In the second century BC, after the end of the war between Rome and Carthage but before the conquest of Gaul, Liu An, the Prince of Huainan and a member of the Han imperial family, once said: "To see the invisible is to find what is seen. To hear the soundless is to find what is heard. The ultimate taste is not satisfying. The ultimate word is not ornate. The ultimate joy is unknown. The ultimate sound is not called... To hear the sound of sound is sound. To hear the sound of silence is wisdom. Without sound, without wisdom, one communicates with the divine." Although the arguments are different, the spirit is the same. "The zither does not sound, yet the twenty-five strings respond with their respective tones. The axle is not connected, yet the thirty spokes each rotate with their strength. The strings have fast and slow, large and small, and then a melody is formed. The chariot has labor and leisure, movement and stillness, and then it can reach far. What makes the sound is the soundless. What can reach thousands of miles is the motionless." The zither is now the highest instrument in China. In the seventeenth century, there were zither techniques that included not only the light plucking and slow kneading of the fingers but also the key to nourishing the mind. The dexterity of the wrist is not enough to achieve a clear and lofty artistic conception. "If the mind is chaotic, the hand is clumsy. If the hand is clumsy, the zither is not still. Only the quiet and determined spirit of a reclusive hermit can achieve stillness. The heart is far from the mundane, and the hand is naturally at ease. Those who burn incense retain its fragrance and drive away its odor. Those who brew tea take its mellow taste and remove its richness. If you want to seek pure sound, you should also cleanse your heart and eliminate worldly desires. The fingers should sweep away all worldly air, and the strings will naturally be clear and ethereal." This long journey is intended to visit this ancient music that still exists today. I will read the books of the sages, meditate deeply, cultivate my mind and nurture my spirit, hoping that the people of that country will not abandon me. The way to control water is to exert effort on the ditches, so that they can follow their nature and each find its place. This is the way to absorb it, and it should be broadened. As for the industrial and commercial sectors, there is a great need for people, and among the three thousand people, all kinds of skills will be available, and each will have a specialty. When I served in the military and political sectors, I often saw military officers and prison officials who, when they needed people for work, could immediately select talents from the military and prisons. For large projects such as construction engineering, everything from earthwork and hardware to painters was often available. For small tasks such as tailors, cooks, laundresses, and gardeners, they could all be summoned immediately. There were even scribes, scholars, painters, artisans, doctors, diviners, and astrologers among them. So, are these three thousand people necessarily lacking in skills other than sleeping and eating? Therefore, I sincerely hope that a government-run job placement center will be established and announced quickly, with extensive advertising, not limited to disaster victims. Everyone should be allowed to register, so that talent will be gathered and supply and demand will be matched. The panic of unemployment will also be relieved, which is beneficial to society and people's livelihood. This is what I truly hope for. (Moved to help disaster relief.)</p>
<p>The Rotary Club's Perspective</p>
<h3>A Husband's Wife (21)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>Madam Li had long had such thoughts in her mind, but she had never spoken of them to anyone, nor had she heard anyone else say them. Madam Li felt that Mr. Chen's argument was a profound truth. She was moved as if struck by electricity and greatly admired Mr. Chen. However, since she had met Mr. Chen, she had never praised him or complimented him. She even wanted to refute him with irrelevant words to test whether his opinion of her was truly genuine, because she suspected that he might be acting, trying to stir her heart and make her sincerely want to be his good friend.</p>
<p>"That cannot be generalized. The opposite of obligation is right. How can you forget that? Are there no mutual rights between husband and wife? Sometimes one party is willing to sacrifice their rights and only fulfill their obligations. Then what is there to argue about? You cannot just take us as an example. Our example is not necessarily universal," Madam Li said, feeling better and deliberately arguing with him.</p>
<p>"Friends' obligations are probably limited and have a time limit, but the rights and obligations of husband and wife are absolutely unlimited and timeless, so it is very easy to become tired and resentful. But in my opinion, rights and obligations are a kind of commercial transaction, only emotion is a kind of spiritual bond, so there is no such thing as obligation and right. This is the case with husband and wife, and it is also the case with friends. For example, you just straightened my clothes for me. I did not ask you to do it, but you did it voluntarily. You have no obligation to straighten this clothes for me, but I have enjoyed the right. When you did it, you did not expect me to repay you in any way, but I have already thanked you. I don't necessarily have to say thank you to you, but you are not unhappy because of this. This is because the relationship between friends is an intimate relationship. If my wife were in front of me, and I asked her to straighten my clothes for me, and she did it, I would feel that this was her obligation and my right. If she did not do it, I would feel that she was not fulfilling her obligation, or she would dislike me for blaming her, and I should not enjoy so many rights, and then there would be unpleasant feelings, and perhaps a dispute would arise. So I say it is still friends, who can understand each other relatively easily. Because I think more thoroughly, I don't restrain my wife too much, nor do I forbid her from associating with male friends. I think the more husband and wife, the less interesting. If you have fulfilled your obligations and are willing to sacrifice your rights, it already contains a component of resentment. It is great to sacrifice yourself without knowing that you have sacrificed yourself," Mr. Chen explained to Madam Li like a scholar lecturing on the philosophy of life. He had never told his wife this kind of view, because he felt that his wife's level was not up to such talk. Only Madam Li, he thought, could be discussed in detail, so he spoke frankly.</p>
<p>Madam Li was of course a smart woman. She admired his eloquence and felt that it was sweeter than ordinary love words. She regretted not having met him before she got married. She hated her own fate, only meeting Mr. Li. She fantasized about how happy she would be if she had a husband like Mr. Chen. Now that he said this, perhaps he also resented not having met me earlier. Thinking of this, she just smiled shallowly and nodded slightly.</p>
<p>"You won the championship in this debate, and I have failed," Madam Li said, sitting up and brushing the beautiful hair on her temples behind her ears, revealing her fair neck, which was truly beautiful.</p>

<h3>The Golden Tide is Overwhelming</h3>
<p>News Arrives in Succession</p>
<p>Falling into a Very Abnormal State</p>
<p>Finally... Reaching 638 Taels</p>
<p>The Outcome... Continuing to Fall by 12.5 Taels</p>
<p>Sixty Taels Plunged Extraterritorially Yesterday, the 22nd, the fluctuations in the gold standard were even more violent, with an unapproachable momentum. The violent storm and heavy rain could not be stopped. At one point, twenty taels plunged, and there were over sixty taels of twists and turns throughout the day, making it extremely difficult to predict. As a result, it fell by more than twelve taels again, and the psychology of the industry was shaken and helpless, so the buying and selling were very chaotic. The market was full of towering waves and dense clouds. The silver market has indeed reported a surge, especially because the United Kingdom has issued an order restricting the export of cash, and Japan's invasion of the Northeast is approaching, so the environment is forced to do so. The opening has broken into the 700 taels mark. Generally, large households sell very hard, and then it plummets by more than 40 taels, and finally it breaks the 640 taels mark again. Since then, all parties have been chasing the progress, and because the exchange rate has returned to level from loose, it is very chaotic. Initially it was more than 1 shilling 6 pence and a half, then it was 5 pence and 25, and the gold market turned upwards again, and once leaped out of the 700 taels mark. At noon, it was languishing again, and then the sellers saw that it was strong, and the market suddenly showed a reversal. It was so peaceful, and because large households repurchased, it had already rushed out of 690 taels. It is heard that various countries will come out to mediate, and the atrocities of the violent Japanese in the eastern provinces may not be expanded again.</p>
<p>The Early Opening Plunges Suddenly The market opened sharply at 11 o'clock in the morning, plummeting 24 taels, to 682 taels, (because the big strips rose sharply by 1 penny 4375 to half, and the silver price increased by 1.5 cents), (but the gross market was initially more than 90 taels, and reopened at 83 taels from the goods market). Then there were 45 taels up and down, from 80 taels to 85 taels, but the selling atmosphere in each store was very strong, and the air in the market was dangerous, and British gold was sold to the bank, but it was not accepted, so the price reached more than 1 shilling and 6.5 pence, so people were very afraid, and it fell by more than 40 taels. At 9:20, it finally became 638 taels. After entering, Dalian Gang Dadecheng Yuankangxiang and others came in, and immediately went upwards, to 589 taels at 9:30, but HSBC shillings and others did not give it, and the hanging card continued to be 51 taels, and the buyers were still strong, and in a moment it rose to 78 taels. Then I heard that HSBC and other exchanges had posted, and British gold soared by 1 penny 625, and the US dollar shrank by 75, so it squeezed the small British and American exchanges, but the Japanese gold mistakenly reported a decrease of 7.5 points, so around 10 o'clock it fell to 63 taels again. It was confirmed that it was hanging 2.5 points large, and it suddenly rose to 74 taels, but the transaction price of each exchange was extremely complicated, so it is difficult to report in detail. At 10:15, it retreated to 65 taels, and there were many buyers lining up. Then Zhifeng Yongqian Changxiang Yuanmao Yong and Wu Mou and others scrambled to buy, and because British gold returned to a good 1525, and then it was 1475 in and out, the hearts of the people who settled in December suddenly rose, rising step by step, until 11:15, it reached 702 taels, (but from 10:15 to 11:15, there were 10 taels of twists and turns,) but Yongheng and others came to sell, and the Indian exchange reported 3 Annas, and it plummeted by more than 10 taels. At 11:30, it was 84 taels, and the wind and waves were huge and could not be stopped. Until the market closed at 86 taels, it was re-made to 90 taels, and Hengxing had something to sell. The listed price was changed to 778 taels and 2 cents, and 110 taels were pressed. At noon, it was 767 taels, and the market closed at 92 taels.</p>
<p>The Later Market Turns Peaceful The later market opened at 93 taels. Because the British gold was hung at 25 points, the US dollar was also small 25, and the Japanese gold was annihilated by 3.5 points. After that, there were more sellers, and it fell by a huge 156 taels. At 2:12, it was 77 taels, and in a moment it increased to 86 taels. Suddenly, it was heard that the Indian exchange reported a large 13 Annas, and at 2:20, it was 80 taels. After that, the ins and outs of each store were disordered, so the price had a 10 taels plate. After 3 o'clock, the big household Wu Mou chased in, and Yuan Mao Yongqian Changxiang Zhifeng Yong and others bought fiercely, and the British gold was also strong. December only settled at 150625, and Mitsui absorbed 1 tael and 5 cents in Dalian in November, and because the Indian exchange returned to a small 10 Annas, it reached 99 taels at 3:30. At this time, Hengxing Yongheng were both out, and they have been inferior, but there is a 45 taels rotation, and at 4 o'clock it is 90 taels, and soon it is added to 95 taels. At 4:10, it is 90 taels again, but the drifting state is unpredictable. Until 4:30, the market closed at 93.5 taels, which was 12.5 taels lower than the previous day, and it was re-made to 99 taels, because it was rumored that the powers came out to mediate the violent Japanese action, so the hearts of the people turned flat. According to the high price of 702 taels and the low price of 638 taels, there is a difference of 64 taels, which is a huge change that has never been seen before. The morning market for goods was 83 taels, the noon closing was 90 taels, and the afternoon was 93 taels. The listed price was changed to 761 taels and 4 cents, and 70 to 80 taels were pressed, and finally 68 taels. The logging and water replenishment in the morning was 86 taels, and in the afternoon it was 94 taels. The current bare price is increased by 8.5 taels.</p>
<p>The Transactions are Extremely Frequent The transactions on the table are extremely complicated and cannot be explored. Only Dadecheng, Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Shunli, Yuan Kangxiang, Futai Heng, and Wu Mou are all in, and Tong Taichang, Wanxing, Sen Chang Yong, Lu Mou, Yifeng Yong, Yongheng, and Cuichang Yong are all out. In the afternoon, Zhifeng Yong, Shunli, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Kangxiang, and Wu Mou are all in, and Yongheng, Dadecheng, Yifeng, and Hengxing are out. The rest are in and out indefinitely. Dalian Gang entered 8,000 and exited 5,000, which has been reversed to a multi-headed position. Guang Gang sold.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Chaotic All Day</h3>
<p>Almost a State of Transaction Without a Market</p>
<p>Exchange Rates Fluctuate Illogically</p>
<p>Yesterday, silver prices surged in the British, American, and Indian markets, but British and American exchange rates plummeted. The HSBC exchange rate was announced late at 10:00 AM, but various exchange rates were still chaotic. British gold increased by one penny and six two-fifths, to one shilling and five pence. The US exchange rate decreased by seventy-five, to thirty yuan and zero two-five. Japanese gold increased by two and a half fen, to one tael, six qian, and one and a half fen. This was due to the squeezing of small exchange rates, but this situation was rare. The remaining rates generally decreased. There was no market for Indian exchange rates.

At 12:05 PM, it suddenly changed to a decrease of two five, to one shilling, four pence, and seven five. US gold also decreased slightly by two five, to thirty yuan. The Japanese gold exchange rate trended downward, decreasing by three and a half fen, to one tael, five qian, and eight fen. The remaining rates also decreased, but the Hong Kong rate did not change. As for the domestic market, it was extremely loose and chaotic all day long, due to the great turbulence in the gold market. As a result, compared to the previous day, British gold increased by eight seven-five, US gold decreased by two five, and Japanese gold remained the same. This was due to the British announcement prohibiting the export of cash, causing British gold to rise sharply and panic among the people. However, Chinese merchants' inflows and outflows were uneven, with more selling than buying. Initially, banks had no appetite due to the chaotic market conditions, almost creating a situation of transaction without a market. Later, transactions occurred, with British gold totaling approximately 300,000 pounds, US gold less so, and Japanese gold of more than 2 million yuan being sold off by Dalian traders to acquire gold. The volatility of the market was unprecedented.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>The Bond Market Still Has Major Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Prices Fluctuate Among Different Markets</p>
<p>Transactions Total 46 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday (22nd), the market situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was that, due to diplomatic relations, people's hearts were chaotic, and prices had huge changes. Buying and selling transactions were extremely lively. Major accounts were entering and settling, and retail transactions were also very active. Speculative trading was also particularly exciting. The market was as tense as before. The trading volume in the first session of the morning market reached 16-17 million, and the second session did not calm down slightly. In the afternoon, because the clearing of field accounts had not been completed, the auction was delayed until 5 o'clock. The current market was still desolate. Bond prices, due to the instability of people's hearts and the supply and demand situation in the market, changed rapidly, and prices also rose and fell unpredictably. There were still major fluctuations. When trading opened in the early morning, the buying momentum was very strong, such as Disarmament and Reorganization, which jumped by as much as two or three yuan compared to the previous day. Then, a large amount of selling on the market caused prices to plummet. After that, prices rose and fell from time to time, and the trend was extremely chaotic, and the trend was unanimously downward. The closing price in the morning market was lower than the closing price of the previous day, ranging from a few jiao to more than one yuan. The bearish sentiment was widespread. Although there were large accounts supplementing and financial institutions purchasing, the selling side ultimately dominated the market. The afternoon market was slightly different. The buying momentum suddenly became very strong, and prices rose step by step, such as Consolidated Tax and Salt Tax, which rose by one yuan to one yuan and six or seven jiao compared to the morning. The market was quite optimistic for a while, and no longer as tense as before. As a result, compared with the previous day, except for the 20 Customs Consolidated Tax forward contract which rose by as much as one yuan and seventy-eight jiao, and Reorganization 20 which also rose by a yuan or several jiao, the Disarmament October contract fell by two yuan and one jiao, and other contracts had mixed ups and downs, and the fluctuations were very uneven. The trading volume in futures was about 30 million in the morning and 15-16 million in the afternoon, totaling about 46 million yuan. The amount was huge, exceeding the highest record of the previous week.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market Soars Rapidly</h3>
<p>The yarn market is soaring, and the situation is strong. With the widespread talk of economic sanctions against Japan, people's hearts are greatly encouraged. A certain major merchant bought up a large batch, causing the market atmosphere to become increasingly tight. At the same time, the local yarn business is improving. However, overseas conditions are still weak, so some are still selling. Japanese merchants have a large number of short positions. Most in the business market expect a turnaround in American cotton, so buying momentum is strong, and the rising trend is intensifying.</p>
<p>Human Mark Leaps Four or Five Taels The opening price of the human mark forward market was still stable, but later, due to major accounts buying up, the market rose sharply, and the situation was sharp. Each month rose by two or three taels. In the afternoon, the buying momentum was even stronger, and each month rose by two taels, two qian and three five. The total transactions were 91,800 bales. The sales were Da Ji 4,000 bales, Tai Xing 2,300 bales, Yong Feng 1,050 bales, Tong Xing 1,400 bales, Yi Yu 2,100 bales, and Da Chang 1,250 bales. The purchases were Chang Feng 2,800 bales, Gong Tai 2,200 bales, Ming Hua 1,050 bales, Rui Da 1,200 bales, Shen Ji 1,650 bales, and Xin Cheng 6,000 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Rises Suddenly</h3>
<p>Driven High by the Yarn Market</p>
<p>The cotton market was driven up by the yarn market, but American cotton was still weak, while the British and Indian cotton markets turned upward. Most in the business market expect a major rise in American cotton tomorrow. After the gold price initially fell and then rose, the market stabilized. Profiteers bought up a large batch, making the situation tight. However, the selling price of foreign cotton is still cheap. The world financial situation is now in chaos, and the national situation is so difficult, so some still intend to sell when prices rise. The future situation is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Han Cotton Rises Eight Qian and a Half In the opening of the exchange's Han Mark morning market, with American cotton still falling, but British and Indian cotton rising, the market atmosphere tightened, and each month rose by four or five qian.

<p>Grains New Foreign Du Point Drops Three or Four Jiao</p>
<p>The arrival of rice boats from various trades in Nantou yesterday was slightly higher. Sales in towns and villages were weak due to the weakening of the northern market. The arrival of foreign rice is gradually increasing, and customer sales are sluggish. People's hearts are trending downward, so transactions are still flat. The price of thick japonica rice was cut by two jiao. It is feared that it will be difficult to turn around before the festival. Early and late indica rice are congested, and the local market is also stagnant, causing prices to follow down by nearly a jiao. New Du Yang Point arrivals are slightly higher, but sales are sluggish and dull due to the unprofitability of the northern market. Only price cuts are made. Prices have dropped by three or four jiao. Variable silver goods are scarce and sluggish, and the market is also weak.</p>
<p>Few ships arrived in Xinzha yesterday, about ten ships. Sales in the local market were flat and slow. Northern japonica rice was high, falling back by nearly a jiao, and buying momentum was very slow. People's hearts are bearish. Foreign rice was affected by the gold market. Although the arrival of old and thin broken rice was small, the sales were flat. Prices did not rise or fall. New Yang Point, New Lu Point, New Ginseng Point and other goods were each lower by three or four jiao. Variable silver fell secretly. Early rice followed the arrival and sales, and the market continued to be strong. River factories had about 3,000 stones of various goods.</p>
<h3>Futures Foreign Rice Suddenly Drops Two or Three Qian</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions, due to floating people's hearts, prices were weak. The spot market was more stable, and the futures market was more affected by gold prices. Foreign merchants were willing to lower prices for sales and return of goods was first affected. Small twisted rice in September and October suddenly dropped by two or three qian. September small twisted rice 200 tons opened at a price of only five taels and seven qian, and October 450 tons opened at five taels and six qian. The spot market opened with 200 bags of small twisted rice, priced at twelve yuan and three jiao, and 100 bags of Saigon, priced at fourteen yuan and one jiao. Guest yuan, on the other hand, had Shantou trades purchase 300 bags of Gan yuan, priced at fourteen yuan, two jiao and nine fen to fourteen yuan.</p>
<h3>Noodles Market Slightly Soft Only</h3>
<p>Yesterday's noodle market, after opening in the afternoon, the market in each month saw a period of impulse. Although foreign wheat had ups and downs, Chicago was slightly lower by two or three jiao, and Kent rose sharply by five or six jiao, but the major strips rose sharply, and the gold market experienced a huge drop in prices, so the hearts of some people were quite soft. This month's lowest was two taels, zero five fen and a half, October was two taels and zero five fen, November and December were two taels and zero six fen, January was two taels and zero seven fen and a half, and February was two taels and zero eight fen and two li and a half. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, the fall was not equal to one or two fen. However, after that, each session gradually improved, because most shorts took the opportunity to cover, causing the market to be supported. By the afternoon, it gradually opened and improved. It was rumored that a large short account close to a certain factory was still rushing to cover, so people's hearts were shocked, and the buying momentum was very strong. However, in terms of the environment, it still feels not optimistic, because the exchange rate has lengthened, and foreign wheat can continue to be determined. It is heard that four ships of Russian wheat were again opened the day before, with a combined price of only three taels and six qian and a half. Although the violent acts of Japan have not been resolved, there is certainly no problem with orders with foreign countries. As a result, September and October fell by one fen and two li and a half compared to the previous day, November fell by one fen and a half, and December to February fell by one fen and two li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, the market in each month was inevitably affected by the sharp fall in gold prices, so this month's lowest was three taels, seven qian and two fen, October was seven qian and four fen, November was seven qian and seven fen, December was eight qian and one fen, January was eight qian and a half, and February was nine qian, falling by two or three fen compared to the previous day. Although the air was not good, major short accounts thought to take advantage of this soft stall and rushed to cover, so the fall was small, and the falling momentum of each session was small. By the time the afternoon market opened, this month was still stable, and the forward contracts were slightly better than the morning due to the continuous and smooth replenishment of major short accounts. According to this situation, it seems that it will be slightly stable, but after excessive prices rise, it is still necessary to prevent the pressure of foreign wheat sales. As a result, this month was slightly lower by one fen compared to the previous day, October to December were better by two fen, January was better by three fen, and February was lower by one fen and five gold</p>
<h3>Pig Lead Increased Due to Rising Fixed Price</h3>
<p>The hardware market, due to the trampling of our eastern province by Japanese soldiers recently, has caused various ports near the area to send telegrams to stop handling goods, so the entire market feels even more quiet. Although the Yangtze River area has slightly lighter floods than before, the local area is still unsettled, so there are also no purchasers. Therefore, the only embellishments of the market are only occasional purchases from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong merchants. However, as the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, these trades are also less likely to purchase more, so the market is quite quiet. Although British and American goods such as plain white iron have slightly opened, the number is not large, so the market has no ups and downs. 28-gauge British white iron roofing sheets sold better yesterday, priced at 16 taels and 2 qian and a half. British steel plates were half a fen and seven li and a half. 400 dan were purchased by Yantai and Zhenjiang trades yesterday, priced at half a fen, six taels and five qian, and seven li and a half, six taels and one qian and a half. The transaction volume of pig lead in this port was not large, but overseas fixed prices soared by two gold pounds, causing the selling price in this port to rise by two or three qian, priced at 15 taels and 8 qian. Although yesterday's spot tin market also saw a rise overseas, the market in this port still has no upward trend. In addition, although tinplate, new lead wire, and black iron sheets have slightly opened, the market has no rise or fall.</p>

<h3>Japan Firmly Adheres to Three Nautical Miles Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>Statement of Second Reply</p>
<p>According to the Eastern News, the Chinese side advocates that 12 nautical miles be the territorial sea. In response, the Japanese government sent a second reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the content of which insists on three nautical miles and declares absolute opposition to the Chinese side's 12 nautical mile proposal.</p>
<h3>Suicides in Germany Increase Again</h3>
<p>Due to the Pressure of the Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Berlin News: The black tide of economic instability has surged among the German people in recent years, and ordinary wage laborers are the most affected. As a result, phenomena such as increased suicides, divorces, reduced birth rates, and increased crime have increased greatly. This year, suicide incidents in Berlin have occurred up to seven times a day. After the bank turmoil in July, suicides increased again, mostly due to the loss of savings. According to a survey by the Commercial Research Institute, during the so-called Stinnes crisis in 1924-1925, the national average number of suicides was 50 per day, accounting for 26 to 28 out of every 100,000 people. By the world economic crisis in 1929, 29 out of every 100,000 people committed suicide. During the darkest period of last winter, an average of 68 people committed suicide every day. According to the Berlin Collection Report, there was a period during the war when the number of casualties was not so high.</p>
<h3>Over 10,000 Boxes of Russian Goods Sampled and Transported to Southern China</h3>
<p>North Manchuria Imports 24 Million Yuan of Russian Goods Harbin News: Since the implementation of the Soviet Russian kerosene five-year plan, kerosene production has greatly increased. By the final year of the five-year plan in 1933, its production can be increased to 150 million boxes. Therefore, the Soviet Union is actively preparing for a large-scale dumping policy. A 1.2 million yuan oil storage pool was recently built in Harbin. In the future, the Soviet Union's kerosene dumping in the Northeast will be surprising. In the first half of this year, the amount of Russian goods imported through Manchuria and Suifenhe reached 24 million yuan. Its aggressive business strategy has been noticed by the general public. Recently, the Soviet Russian state-owned trading company loaded over 10,000 boxes of Russian goods samples onto German ships and transported them to Southern China.</p>
<h3>Marshal Foch of France</h3>
<p>European War Diary Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>After three hours of bombardment, the French Franchet d'Espèrey Army Group began its offensive between Diksmuide and the Lys River at 5:30 AM on September 28th. They achieved a great victory, completely capturing the first line of German defenses, and the second line was greatly shaken.</p>
<p>The next morning, I went to the Franchet d'Espèrey Army Group, visited General Plumer of the American forces in Cassel, met with King Albert of Belgium in La Panne, and then went to Houthem to see Major General Gillain. I urged them to advance rapidly towards Lillers and Hazebrouck. The morale of the troops was not slack. On the 29th, Diksmuide was recovered, and the Bixschoote Ridge and the important towns of Messines and Wytschaete successively fell. Within two days, 10,000 prisoners were captured, along with 200 artillery pieces.</p>
<p>On the 30th, progress continued, but the advance was slightly slowed by rain. However, the British Second Army had already approached Menin and advanced to the left bank of the Lys River.</p>
<p>On October 1st and 2nd, orders were given to temporarily halt the advance in order to re-establish contact with the rear and then intensify the offensive.</p>
<p>Movement in the war zone was difficult. The terrain was riddled with shell holes, filled with mud and water. Several sections of the supply line on the right bank of the Yser River had already been cut off, and in some places, soldiers on the front lines were unable to receive food and ammunition. It was necessary to temporarily use aircraft to transport supplies. To enable the supply convoys to move, the transportation routes had to be thoroughly repaired. In several places, elevated roads, several miles long, had to be built.</p>
<p>Although movement was difficult, the achievements of our army in the Franchet d'Espèrey Army Group were already significant. Fearing the advance of the Franchet d'Espèrey Army Group north of the Lys River and the simultaneous advance of the British Army south of the Sensée River, the German forces retreated before the British Fifth Army (commanded by General Birdwood). The British Fifth Army was operating on the right flank of the British Second Army and had established contact with the First Army. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Our Expectations</h3>
<p>— Jingzhai</p>
<p>The reason why we, the Jing'e Drama Society, are here to perform "A Patriotic Heart" at the invitation of the Lu City Exhibition can be simply stated in two points. First, of course, we want to contribute our very limited strength to appeal for our afflicted compatriots, so that they can receive some tangible benefits and spiritual comfort – material relief. But more importantly, the second point is that I sincerely want to use the only valuable thing we young people have, our boiling passion, to awaken the inspiration of our numb and insensitive compatriots who are still asleep in the dark.</p>
<p>We still remember that in the first issue of the "New Era" weekly, we published an article titled "Our Experience." In this article, on the one hand, we outlined our experience and the structure of our organization. At the same time, we also clarified our goals and our attitude. We said these words: "Drama can satirize life, regulate life, and symbolize life, represent life, and even guide life." In addition, I also stated more clearly in the article "After Seeing The Liar" in this column on June 20th, "We know that the significance and mission of the drama society movement is not only to achieve maturity in technical aspects, but its greatest and most important significance lies in its ability to stimulate a social effect. Therefore, here, all comrades who are striving for the drama movement must know that our success is multifaceted and must contain a central consciousness. As for the perfect and wonderful expression and the intricate and profound plot, these are still secondary issues." Regarding these two points, the former can be said to be our understanding of the true meaning of drama, and the latter can be said to be the goal of our efforts in the drama movement. This has always been considered reasonable by us from the beginning of our work to the recent present, especially in this year – when natural disasters and man-made calamities, internal troubles and foreign invasions, are intertwined, it should be considered that our understanding and the path we are taking are correct and there is no mistake.</p>
<p>But we are just ordinary young people without strength, only with a passion and sincerity. Therefore, when we hear and see the suffering and groaning of the tens of thousands of afflicted compatriots, and the shocking and heartbreaking sight of our homeland stained with the blood of our compatriots flowing from the guns and bayonets of strong neighbors, how heartbroken and angry we are!</p>
<p>However, perhaps because our nation has suffered too deep and too great stimulation and pain, most people seem to have lost their senses and become numb. Perhaps it is fundamentally because the national self-strengthening consciousness of our great Chinese nation has disappeared. Otherwise, why is it that in the face of this natural disaster and foreign invasion, none of us are willing to be invigorated, abandon all our prejudices, and work together to use a death-defying will to fight for the survival and growth of our nation at this critical moment?</p>
<p>Because of this continuous internal turmoil, we think of the afflicted compatriots in the thirteen provinces who are in rags and crying for help. And because of the dark shadows of the afflicted compatriots in the thirteen provinces who are in rags and crying for help, we also think of the occupation of the thousands of miles of our good land, stained with fresh blood. Furthermore, because of the pain of the occupation of this thousands of miles of our good land, stained with fresh blood, we cannot help but think of a few lines in the play "A Patriotic Heart." Akiko is a Japanese woman who married a Chinese man. For the benefit of her own nation and country, she does not hesitate to force her dearest husband and son to be traitors, cause the subjugation of their country, and become slaves, saying, "I love my Japan." At the same time, our two compatriots, the husband and son, although under this extremely distressed and oppressive force, finally gave us a cry of resistance like a lion's roar.</p>
<p>("I love my China.")</p>
<p>From this, we can gain a new understanding and awakening. We can know that even between those as close as husband and wife, mother and son, inevitable conflicts can arise due to the interests of their own country and nation. Then, are those clichés and stale tunes of "maintaining East Asian peace," "same script, same race," and "Sino-Japanese friendship" that exist only in words and on white paper still worth our blind faith and admiration? Look, the three eastern provinces are the territory of our Republic of China, but now they have been forcibly swallowed and plundered by the violent Japanese. It is time for us to wake up. We should support the soul of our nation, which is on the verge of death, and we should all shout in resistance,</p>
<p>("We love our China.")</p>
<p>Oh, when we think of this place, the dark shadows of the afflicted compatriots who are in rags and crying for help, and the tragic sight of a scorched earth covered in blood and flesh, reappear before our eyes. We are heartbroken, we are angry, and we do not know how we will dedicate ourselves. Oh, we can only offer you fresh blood and a passionate heart, praying that all our compatriots can, from now on, have a determination to "I love my China," and hope that everyone will contribute their strength to help our afflicted compatriots and to resist the enemy of the entire Chinese nation, Japan.</p>
<h3>Autumn is Here</h3>
<p>— Huo Biao</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, Wei came to my residence. He has obviously become much thinner recently. Although we can still find a trace of innocent smile on his face from time to time, it quickly fades away and often disappears, making it impossible to grasp. Over the past month, we two seemed to have speculated a lot for a certain need, and gradually changed from sparse to dense. The intimacy of this kind of conversation, even we ourselves could not have imagined that our friendship would have such progress. Tonight, he caught a very excited look, but he was panting, his cheeks with some drunken look, and an unnatural emotion reflected the ripples on his heart lake.</p>
<p>"Long, let's take a walk in the park," he said as soon as he stepped in, "It's too stuffy in the room, it doesn't soothe my heart."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" I had doubts about his hasty attitude. "You seem very excited, but what new attack have you suffered, you are taking it seriously, right?"</p>
<p>"There's nothing to take seriously, my friend, let's talk in the park."</p>
<p>He took my hand, so we walked slowly. The park is less than a hundred steps away from my residence, but it took about a quarter of an hour. On the way, we listened to the sad cries of the autumn cicadas. Suddenly, Wei clenched my hand and said,</p>
<p>"Friend, autumn is here," the tone was desolate, as if with infinite meaning.</p>
<p>"Oh..." I was speechless for a moment, as if my soul had been violently awakened. I couldn't know why my friend would talk about the problem of "autumn is coming," and I didn't even know how a resonance of sorrow would occupy our air. I thought, I groped...</p>
<p>With a "swish," several yellow leaves fell in front of us. We laughed foolishly at each other, everything was contained in silence.</p>
<p>Entering the park gate, Wei said to the scene in front of him after only a few steps,</p>
<p>"Alas, the god of desolation, has the face changed in just a few days? Has the fiery warmth disappeared?"</p>
<p>"That's right," I blurted out unconsciously, "This is the authority of autumn."</p>
<p>We skimmed over some sparse figures, avoided some scattered hustle and bustle, and chose a secluded high pier to sit down.</p>
<p>Wei's expression was changing, it was as if all kinds of thoughts were lurking in his heart, but we were all afraid to speak. Unnecessary loneliness was active around us, and we were ashamed that we couldn't immediately break the gap between us.</p>
<p>I gazed at the boundless sky, I overlooked the shadows of the trees, I held my breath and wanted to speak, but a certain kind of invasion, invisible, made me want to stop again. Tonight, I stirred up Wei's scars that I hadn't warmed for a long time, but in the end I couldn't maintain the silence. Wei said with a repentant tone, "I can't let her leave me, if I lose her, my life will have no light, no hope..."</p>
<p>"That was last autumn," he paused for a while and then continued, "It was also such an evening that I discovered that she had been seduced by another man, so I was indescribably frustrated and suffered a sickness. I killed the heart to possess her, and from then on, I didn't want to see her again. We have been separated forever. But, until I die, I will always love her. Her hair, her dimples, her gentleness, all her contours..." He spoke in the tone of performing a play.</p>
<p>"But since then," he continued, "The interest in my life has decreased. Alas, how will I place my love? Now that autumn is here again, where can I find peace?"</p>
<p>I listened to his words that were inspired by the depression, and I didn't know whether to sympathize with him or to grieve my own life. I secretly wiped away tears, but I couldn't say it as straightforwardly as he did, as if it was vomiting blood.</p>
<p>"So for the coming of this autumn wind," he said again, "I can only think of escaping. This situation really can't make you settle down, and all life is tied to the rotating machine of contradiction."</p>
<p>"Friend, let's be more objective," I tried to calm down, "Women are... Pursuing her will only lead you to the abyss of pain."</p>
<p>"However..." We will abandon women for the rest of our lives..."</p>
<p>"Of course it's not saying that," I defended, "But rather than being in love with a woman who doesn't understand love, I think it's better to refuse."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>The cool wind blew past, and we were unconsciously silent for a long time, as if intoxicated, and as if deeply disgusted.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introductions</p>
<h3>Introduction to Statistical Methods</h3>
<p>— Shuyuan</p>
<p>Author 丨丨丨丨 Xu Binghan</p>
<p>Statistics, as an independent science and as an important subject recognized by the general public, has only been around for the past fifty years. The main purpose of this book is to describe the statistical methods used in modern times and to provide scholars with a basis to follow. The book is divided into four parts and seventeen chapters.</p>
<p>The first chapter describes a brief history of statistics. Before 3500 BC, Egypt had compiled household and wealth registers to build the pyramids. Then in 4400 BC, Rameses II, in order to eliminate the abuses of uneven land distribution and redistribute the land, compiled a land statistical table of Egypt. This is the beginning of statistics. At that time, the purpose of compiling statistical tables was to assist the government in administrative convenience and military strategy, so the calculations were all ordinary materials such as taxes, land distribution, and the number of soldiers. Until the mercantile era (merchantilistic Perild), statistics made great progress. Because the government at that time worshiped monetarism, it had to encourage the country's industry and commerce on the one hand, and had to seek exports exceeding imports on the other hand. The various laws and regulations that arose from this need had to rely on accurate statistics to determine their legislative policy, so statistics became more and more important at that time. Since then, the longer the time, the wider the scope of statistical tables has become. In the recent three or four decades, the compilation of statistical tables has become more precise. Almost all modern powers have established statistical bureaus. The National Bureau of Statistics of the United States is an example.</p>
<p>In this chapter, the modern statistical community is divided into two major categories, one is statistical method and the other is applied statistics. The so-called method statistics not only pays attention to the research of special methods, but also pays attention to the manufacture of general laws (Laus), rules (Rules) and methods (Mothods). Applied statisticians apply the laws and formulas created by methodologists to existing concrete facts. It can also be divided into scientific and descriptive, like the population statistics of the United States, which not only compares the people and resources in a certain time in various parts of the country, but also compares them with the population and resources decades ago. This is the best example of descriptive statistics. Scientific statistics often uses recording past materials to construct certain physical or psychological laws.</p>
<p>In the second chapter, the definition of statistics is described. The definitions given by many experts are collected together and carefully verified. Finally, a broader definition is determined as follows: Statisticians are those who judge the collective phenomena of nature or society based on the results obtained from the analysis of calculations or the collection of estimates.</p>
<p>The third chapter describes the functions, characteristics and materials of statistics. The function of statistics is not only valuable to politicians and entrepreneurs, but also theoretical economists and scientific investigators must use statistics to prove their theories or assumptions. Therefore, biologists use this to prove the laws of change and inheritance, and economists use this to establish rules for population, wages, and prices, or to express the causal relationship between different phenomena of each group, such as the relationship between financial panic and unemployment. Sociologists use this to prove the relationship between crime, poverty, suicide and other related phenomena. These are all functions of statistical science. As for the characteristics of statistics, it lies in its ability to simplify complexity. The various things in a group can give us an accurate concept without the tediousness of counting them one by one. For example, to investigate the average wage of workers in this country, there is no need to count the work of each worker. If we can find a few model examples and get their average, we can know the general idea. There are several methods for collecting statistical materials. One is the personal collection method. The investigator personally investigates, can know the situation of the investigation, and is created by one hand, and can get accurate benefits. This method is mostly applicable to natural sciences, and is also used in the investigation of sociology and economics. There is also a method, that is, the investigator hires many recorders or correspondents, and collects the results of their calculations or estimates, or the statistician collects the results of the calculations or estimates of private statisticians and compares them, examines them, and gets the final result. However, the statistics obtained by applying this method are not very accurate, so most of the numerical research work on economics or sociology must rely on government reports, because only the government has the financial resources and will to collect true statistics on the activities of the people of the whole country. Moreover, government statistics can exercise the power to force people to report, but individuals cannot. This is another point where government statistics are superior to private statistics.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter describes the solutions to practical problems, such as defining the scope of the problem and selecting the problem factors. These are extremely important for statistics.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter is dedicated to describing the statistical unit. Statistics often cannot be separated from numbers, and numbers must first determine the unit, and the final unit must be consistent with the name of the unit. Sometimes the nouns cannot be fully determined, then an exact definition must be given to this unit. Choosing a statistical unit not only requires the definition to be correct, but also its nature must be measurable. Abstract things should be expressed in concrete words to facilitate measurement.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter describes the design and collection of statistical materials. Here we are told that there is a characteristic of statistical work, that is, everything must be considered in advance, the origin of errors must be prevented in advance, and the general results must be estimated in advance. All problems, factors, units, assumptions, tables, recorders, tabulation, working methods, time, expenses, etc., are issues that should be carefully considered in advance. As for the methods of collecting materials, the following four are commonly used: (1) personal investigation, (2) estimation by correspondents, (3) forms are filled out by the respondents, (4) forms are processed by recorders. Which of these four methods should be used is appropriate, depending on the nature of the problem, the accuracy of the desired results, and the amount of funds available.</p>
<p>The seventh and eighth chapters discuss the accuracy of statistics. Possible accuracy can be obtained based on various mathematical calculations.</p>
<p>The ninth chapter is about the first analysis problem after the materials are collected – tabulation. There are very detailed instructions on the title and style of the table.</p>
<p>The tenth chapter is about the function of diagrams. Although the numbers in the table can be neat and orderly, they are not convenient for memory or comparison. The main purpose of statistics is to make numerous numbers clear and understandable, so that people can know at a glance. To achieve this goal, there are methods of supplementing or explaining, and diagrams are the most common method.</p>
<p>The eleventh chapter is about the function and classification of frequency tables. When we study various natural phenomena, we find that each group has its own characteristics. Therefore, there is a method of group research, and the table created is called a frequency table.</p>
<p>Chapters twelve to fourteen describe the shortcomings and advantages of various counting methods. There are many formulas in it, which can be used to obtain accurate results.</p>
<p>An important part of statistics lies in the comparison of phenomena in various periods. There are many methods of comparison. The fifteenth chapter describes historical statistics, divided into (1) absolute number tables, (2) absolute historical statistical diagrams, (3) logarithmic statistical tables, (4) logarithmic historical statistical diagrams, (5) index numbers, (6) historical statistical diagrams of index numbers.</p>
<p>The sixteenth chapter describes various methods of comparison. The ultimate goal of all statistical research is comparison. The so-called comparison is to show the relationship between things in time and space, so that we have a clear concept of it. There are very precise numerical explanations for the drawing methods of various charts in comparison.</p>
<p>The last chapter is about the relationship between each other, which means that there is a certain causal relationship between two continuous series or two groups of things. The relationship between each other can be divided into the same relationship and the opposite relationship. There are many tables in this chapter, all of which are very precise.</p>
<p>In this book, in addition to describing the history of statistics, all the shallow methods related to statistics, which are indispensable for the research or tabulation of simple statistical materials, are discussed in great detail. Other analysis and comparison methods are also included without omission. I dare say that this book is a good reference book for practical statisticians, especially in the social sciences. At the end of the book, there are many charts, all of which are very precise and rare.</p>
