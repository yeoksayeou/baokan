<p>德國當局方以經濟困難。急謀與鄰邦妥協。以圖所以自救之時。而國内之各黨派。則以當局不顧人民之苦痛。緊急命令之過於嚴酷。政局上有突然發生變動之勢。此則益陷當局於困境矣。德政府以財政缺乏之無法彌補。故不得已一方赴英求援。希望修改楊格計劃。以減輕對外負擔。一方頒布緊急命令。增加新税。以求政府收支之適合。此固爲政府無可如何中急求所以自救之計。然今觀其對外希望。尙在虚無縹渺之中。而其國内之左右各政黨及各省圑體等。已起而一致反抗政府之命令。據柏林電謂白魯寗返德後。内部顯將發生巨變。各地已起示威運動。此種事態。殊足使政府外交上之進行。受重大打擊。夫外交之成功與否。固須視外交當局之手段。亦須視其國内政局之安定與否。國内政局不安。則易使外人觀望藉口。而陷外交於停頓。故德政府在今日。已有不能不將緊急命令修改之勢。而在政黨方面苟非盡如極端派。之主張。必欲推倒政府而後快者。則今日亦不宜爲過甚之舉。致陷國家於無法收拾之窮境也。</p>

<h3 id="c68">肺癆病原菌脫蠟術新發明 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>（一）（由最近德國結核雜誌編譯）</p>
<p>自考克博士發見結核菌爲肺結核症（即肺癆病）之病原體以來。東西結核學者爭先研究。欲期得一殺滅此菌之妙方。但其結果盡歸失敗。蓋因歷來一般之醫家。因未明瞭肺結核菌之别具一種特殊性構造。以爲凡爲病菌。盡可以消毒之藥劑。用内服或注射之方法撲滅之。一如「六○六」之注射於梅毒也。自柏格爾博士ＤrBergell苦心研究後。始發表肺結核菌有一種特殊之防禦力。能抵抗一切外來藥力之攻擊。蓋肺結核菌體係中性脂肪之内膜及抗酸性蠟質之外膜Llpoid所構成。若非設法破壞其蠟質之防線及解除其肪脂性之武裝。則無由俘擒結核菌而置之死地。且結核菌襲入人體局部時。其四週即被侵蝕。而形成頑强之結節。以阻礙血流之通過。致使注射或内服之一般消毒藥劑。無由越雷池一步。宛如特别戒嚴之禁區藥力旣無從接觸患部。則雖溺沉全身於藥池中。亦不能傷結核菌之毫髮。是以撲滅肺結核菌之唯一作戰方略。至少必須具備下列之兩種行决條件。</p>
<p>（一）凡藥力能破壞結節而直逹患部者。</p>
<p>（二）又能剝奪或溶解其蠟質及脂肪性之内外膜者。</p>
<p>如此始能奏破關斬將之功。否則隔靴掻癢。彼結核菌且在此兩種保障之下。竊笑人之莫余害也。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>曾有哈莫塞哈黎Hammersehaly,及提體潘斯基Terebensky氏等。發現結核菌之抗酸性。係因蠟質能抗酸而然。遂應用五乃至一○％之苛性加里液。而得除去結核菌之抗酸性蠟質。後有莫純Moussn及高披爾Goupjl兩氏。應用鹽素瓦斯。而亦得除去抗酸性蠟質。然此種脫蠟法。祇能適用於顯微鏡檢查上染色法而已。蓋其藥性劇毒。對於人體終不能實用也。</p>
<p>近數年來。偶有戕大楓子油應用於麻瘋症。而獲意外之奏效者。蓋麻瘋菌與肺結菌爲同性質之抗酸菌。而大楓子油能有脫蠟之作用。兼具石炭酸百倍以上之殺菌力。於是一般學者。遂引起狂熱的注意。思以大楓子之油。應用於結核症患者。冀圖奏效。乃用種種之化學的方法。提出大楓子油之主要成分。然祇限於皮膚及表在性結核症。能奏良效。而對於深部的臟器。如肺臟。肝臟。腎臟等結核。則仍不能奏何等之效果。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>因此我普天下結核病者之大恩師柏格爾博士。百尺竿頭。再進一步。搜集動植礦物性各種藥物。而苦心研究。期得一種有脫蠟作用。而無大楓子油之種種缺點者。孜孜數十年。不知絞盡幾許腦汁。瀝竭幾許心血。以求其最合理最純粹的化學劑不已。終發見特殊動物之腸間膜腺壓縮汁中。有某一種有效成分。對於結核菌有强力脫蠟之作用。乃即將此新成分作用於結核菌。而行基兒加排特氏。Ｚiehlgabett'染色法。則已不染紅色。而染靑色。此項結果。與他種非抗酸菌完全相同。自此東西醫家所視爲人工不能除去結核菌抗酸性之主張。完全推翻。而占脫蠟殺菌劑中之最高權威。遂將此化合物實驗於動物及人體之各種結核症。均得偉大之神效。並無副作用。此實前後千古醫學界一大疑問的肺結核治療之新曙光也。</p>
<p>結核菌之構造圖</p>
<p>肺病患者之肺臟</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>肺結核之病原及病理旣闡明後。柏格爾大醫聖發明之肺結核治療上理想的新醫理。亦實驗而大功告成。二十世紀唯一無二之肺結核特效藥「三那星」。Sanosin遂遵此新醫理新學說而産生。開醫學界一未有之新紀錄。茲將「三那星」所含有之要成分。臚述於下。</p>
<p>第一成分之化學名Aminoaethylsulfonsaeure(C2h7nso3)係由特殊動物之腸間膜線肝臟。及海中軟體動物之血液中提取製出者也。其化學性質。無色透明。爲有光輝之四出或六出形結晶。在攝氏十二度。能溶解於十六倍之冷水。於熱湯更易溶解。但不能溶解於無水酒精及依的兒内。如以强鹽性液煮沸之。則成醋酸及亞硫酸。與水銀溶合時。則形成不溶於水之白色粉末。倘於攝氏二百四十度分解。而加以數部之炭酸曹逹。更細密混合。加熱於白金板上。則生殘塊。據修例德博士。Dr.Sohroder之實驗報告。謂此種成分。能施直接作用於結核菌。而溶解其外膜之蠟質及脂肪質。結核菌旣失去此險要之屏藩。遂不能免避其死刑。抑尤有進者。此種成分。且有一種相當之剌激性。能使患者之胆汁增加其分泌量。且新陳代謝之機能。愈形旺盛。對於肺病　。則又能變化其結締織。而奏治療的效果。</p>
<p>第二成分係提曼博士Dr.Tiemsnn創製之KalllumSulfoouaiecolloum(C6Ｈ5ＯＨ)(OCH)2So2OK其功用能增進結核患者之抵抗力。及血淸之凝結力。促進新陳代謝。增加白血球。防止結核菌之發育。有健胃袪痰消毒之特殊作用。故自現代著名結核大醫萊享白哈博士Dr.Ｒeichenbach提倡應用於肺結核以來。德英諸國醫家莫不以此成分奉爲治療結核症之無上聖</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>綜合以上二大寳貴之主要成分。而製成「三那星」新藥。故「三那星」爲肺結核治療上空前絶後之特效新藥。確有極大之價値。茲舉其醫治作用於下。</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中。實驗「三那星」之藥力作用。則一分鐘後。結核菌皆消失其抗酸性。至三分鐘後。則肺結核菌完全殺盡。無一倖免。</p>
<p>（二）以内服或注射之方法。應用「三那星」於人體。則能滲入於肺臟等各臟器内部。迄十八小時後。檢查小便。則能發見ＤＩＢＺＯ之反應。於四十八小時後。此反應即行消失。而白血球非常增加。</p>
<p>（三）依動物試驗。則發見「三那星」能滲入結核病竈内。設檢查其病竈内潛伏之結核菌。則盡失其抗酸性。此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣。</p>
<p>（四）内服「三那星」約一星期左右。則可見喀痰之稀釋。體熱之下降。及心身愉快等之狀態。　　（五）更繼續内服「三那星」逹一二個月以上。則顯見體重增加。食欲激進。一切症狀。逐漸緩和。終逹其回天再造之偉功。</p>
<p>奉送三那星實驗報告書及肺病療養指導書函索即寄</p>

<h3 id="c90">鳥言獸語的讀物應當打破嗎　㈡　陳·鶴·琴· <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>（乙）記得上星期也看到一張滑稽副片、很可以做我們的參考、這張片子呌做「動物音樂會」、開會以前、有許多動物穿了衣服、載了眼鏡、坐了各種交通器具、來赴這盛大的音樂會、有的坐了飛艇軋：：軋：：的從天上飛下來、有的坐了汽車嗚：：嗚：：的從橋上開下來、有的坐了火車共：：共：：的從遠處衝過來、有的坐了馬車得：：得：：的從街跑過來、形形色色、非常熱鬧、</p>
<p>開會的時候、節目頗覺有趣、忽而有三四位靑蛙姑娘拉着手、張着口、跳舞唱歌、忽而有五六位老鼠小姐、蹺着尾、抬着頭大唱特唱、唱得非常出色、忽有一位白猫先生、掛着身子、吊了尾巴、兩手彈琴、兩隻眼睛、忽大忽小、神氣十足、那時黃狗·雄鷄·烏鴉·：：有的敲銅鼓、有的拉凡亞鈴：：呌的呌、跳的跳、各獻各的一領、忽而這様、忽而那様、約有十分鐘的功夫、這張片子演了之後、全塲不期然而然的鼓掌起來、像這種「動物音樂會」、純粹是一種鳥言獸語的物語、而這種物語、不但小孩子喜歡看、就是成人也非常歡迎、</p>
<p>㈤實在的閲讀經騐鳥言、獸語的讀物、在歐美非常風行、我不知道那歐美的小孩子看了聽了這些讀物究竟受到什麽壞的影響、我現在且把我自已所得到的經騐來說一說、我的幾個小孩子對於鳥言獸語的讀物可以說是都很喜歡的、不但一種很普通的鳥言獸語的讀物就是很神怪的一種材料如西游記｜二郎神捉拿孫猴子、封神榜等等：：也都是非常喜歡聽、喜歡看、</p>
<p>我有時讀了之後或者他們自已看了之後、我就問他們這種事情是眞的嗎、是眞有孫猴子嗎、他眞能一個觔斗翻十萬八千里路嗎、他們都回答說、『没有的、不會的、』有時候甚至於回答說、這是故事、講講的、』我又問他們說、這些故事旣然是假的、爲什麽你們還喜歡聽呢、他們回答說『好玩』、</p>
<p>這様看來、這些認爲兒童的消遣讀物、於年幼的小孩子實在没有什麽妨礙、</p>
<p>總結起來、小孩子尤其在七八歲以内的、對於鳥言獸語的讀物、是很喜歡聽、喜歡看、喜歡表演的、這種讀物、究竟有多少害處呢、可說是很少很少、他看的時候、祗覺得他們好玩而並不是眞的相信的、</p>
<p>至於這種鳥言獸語的讀物、常常講給小孩子聽或給小孩子看、那當然有種危險、這種危險與平常小孩子所需要的東西是一様的、猶如『吃奶』、</p>
<p>我們都曉得奶是很好的營養料、小孩子非他不能生存的、不過到了一歲半以後、他還是吃奶、而不吃旁的東西、那他雖然不致於有什麽危險、但是要受損失的、我們應當慢慢兒給他吃些别的東西、鳥言獸語的讀物與吃奶是有些彷彿的、年幼的小孩子是很喜歡聽鳥言獸語的故事、恐怕在那時候祗有講那些故事給他聽、寫那些讀物給他看、好像一歲以内的小孩子祇有餵奶給他吃、到了大了以後、奶應當少吃、而鳥言獸語的讀物也應當少講少看、多給他看些旁的讀物、但是我們絶對不可說奶是壞的東西不能給他吃的、</p>
<p>最後我要愼重聲明的、鳥言獸語的讀物、自有他的相當地位、相當價値、我們成人是没有權力去剝奪兒童所需要的東西的、好像我們剝奪小孩子吃奶的那一種權利、</p>
<p>不過小孩子到了大的時候、我們應當供給他看别種材料猶如奶吃了、再給他吃别的營養料一様、</p>
<p>現在在我國成年的兒童讀物、還是那種鳥言獸語以及各種神怪的故事、好像成年的小孩子、還是要一天到晚吃奶的様子、請敎小孩子怎様會强健呢、我們應當竭力的多編各種科學故事、來豐富他的經騐、來引起他的興趣、</p>
<p>我要附帶聲明的、就是現在書坊上所出的各種神怪小說、武俠小說、實在是不合兒童的心理、而且含有一種誨謡的意味、甚至出售荒誔不經而引起恐佈的讀物、如各種兔的故事等等、這些故事、最好不要給小孩子看、（完）</p>

<p>Ganzhou: Chen Mingshu issued a circular telegram stating, "All newspapers are hereby notified that the spread of the Red bandits has become a major disaster, especially in Jiangxi province, where their fierce flames are particularly intense. The life and death of our compatriots and comrades are imminent. If we do not quickly seek to extinguish them, the foundation of the Party will be destroyed, and the nation will be lost. The officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army have served the Party and the country for many years, rushing to all directions. They have long wished to retire and return to their fields in order to alleviate the burden of the country and as a warning against self-preservation through military force. They have repeatedly requested this without success and have again received the order to suppress the bandits. Considering the greater righteousness, how dare they complain of hardship? Even my request to be relieved of political power was originally intended to sacrifice myself for the greater good. However, due to the supervision of the Central Government, the urging of the old troops, and the reproaches of conscience, I have again re-entered the military and strive to repay the Party and the country. Now that we are in this situation and witness the misery, we swear with the pure blood of our hearts to contribute to the Party and the country, to eliminate this morning's food and die without regret. It is hoped that comrades and compatriots, as well as friendly forces from all sides, will work together to encourage each other to quell the great calamity and save the country from destruction. As for the internal problems of the Party, they should be resolved within the Party. After the Red bandits are suppressed, there will be time for leniency and guidance. We hold peace and unity as our goal and can easily promote its realization with collective strength. I respectfully offer my sincerity, hoping for your wise consideration." Chen Mingshu bows respectfully. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<p>Liberal Party to Propose Amendments</p>
<p>Parliament Faces Dissolution</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: The differences between the Liberal Party and the Labour Party regarding the government's tax plan have now suddenly become serious and threaten to dissolve Parliament. It is reported that the government sent a letter of ultimatum to the leader of the Liberal Party yesterday, stating that if the Liberal Party insists on proceeding with the proposed amendment to the land tax, the government will regard it as a matter of confidence. The Liberal Party's amendment, which will be proposed on June 16, will limit the land tax to uncultivated land only, completely overturning the original intent of the government's proposal. The Labour Party's organ newspaper said that if the Liberal Party insists on proposing an amendment and overturning the government, it will be responsible for destroying the land tax bill, the electoral system reform bill, and the Indian Round Table Conference. The Liberal Party's newspapers said that the most opposed to mediation is Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden. If the amendment is passed, the government must withdraw the land tax and the Chancellor of the Exchequer must resign to avoid a general election.</p>

<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 11th: British naval authorities here announced that HMS Poseidon is still aground on the seabed. Efforts to lift it by the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes and the submarine support ship HMS Medway have failed. Bad weather has severely hampered rescue efforts. On one occasion, after the cable was tied, it was intended to pull it out of the water, but all the cables broke unexpectedly, and the boat was stranded on the seabed again. According to the divers, they repeatedly entered the water and used iron hammers to hit the hull of the Poseidon, but no one in the boat responded.</p>
<p>Reuters, Yantai, 11th: According to news from Weihaiwei, the hope of saving the eighteen soldiers trapped in the submarine Poseidon has been lost. It is now believed that everyone must have died.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: The First Lord of the Admiralty announced the news of the sinking of the submarine Poseidon in the Lower House today, and said that of those who escaped using the Davis apparatus, two have died, and one is in critical condition. The Davis apparatus is shaped like a lifebuoy and is attached with a gas mask. When a submarine accident occurs, those trapped in the boat can use their mouths to breathe while waiting for rescue. This object was first equipped in submarines last year, and this is the first time it has been used.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bayonne, USA, 10th: According to the opinion of Elsburg, an American submarine salvage expert, under appropriate conditions, the soldiers who have not yet died in the British submarine Poseidon can be rescued, and the sunken boat can also be salvaged within a few days. One hundred and twenty feet is not very deep. If the climate is good, there is still hope of saving those trapped in the boat. The Davis artificial lung has now proven its value.</p>

<p>Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th: This afternoon, Tokyo, Yokohama, Hakone, and the Izu Peninsula experienced another earthquake. The first one was at 3:16, followed by tremors from time to time within half an hour. The area of ​​the severe earthquake was similar to that of the great earthquake last autumn, but the intensity was far greater than that encountered a few days ago. According to seismologists, the epicenter was in a nearby bay, about 60 miles from Tokyo, and was in the same location as the epicenter of the great earthquake in 1923. This time it was a transverse crack. The material losses are not very heavy, only the walls and water pipes are cracked, and some telephone poles have been knocked down. The Tanna Tunnel between Atami and Mishima is close to the epicenter, and it is reported that it has not been damaged. However, when the earthquake occurred, the people in various places were quite panicked and mostly fled to the outside.</p>

<h3 id="e31">The Case of Jiang Zhihuan's Surrender of Rights and Humiliation of the Nation <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Control Yuan Announces the Process of Impeachment</p>
<p>The case of Zhuang Zhihuan, the former Director of the Department of Electrical Affairs of the Ministry of Communications, who revised the underwater cable contracts of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies, thereby surrendering rights and humiliating the nation, has been brought forward for impeachment by the Control Yuan, and the handling process has been announced. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Full Text of the Impeachment: Control Yuan members Tian Jiongjin, Gao Yihan, Liu Eqing, and others submitted an impeachment document against Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Department of Electrical Affairs of the Ministry of Communications, stating: "It is submitted that Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Department of Electrical Affairs of the Ministry of Communications, negotiated with the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and other companies regarding international telecommunications submarine cables. The conditions agreed upon violated the Party's foreign policy and the policy of independent electrical recognition, as well as the solutions proposed by the Ministry of Communications, constituting dereliction of duty and surrender of rights. It is appropriate to immediately bring forward an impeachment. We believe that the Party's political program and government policies are based on the principle of recovering national sovereignty and freedom of international communication. It has been investigated that on January 1, Year 19, the Executive Yuan forwarded a document to the National Government, stating that, according to the joint report of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Communications, no government, company, or individual of any country will be granted exclusive rights to land submarine cables within Chinese territory. Furthermore, it has been investigated that on May 18, Year 18, the Executive Yuan secretly submitted a document to the National Government, stating that the Ministry of Communications proposed a comprehensive solution for the Great Eastern and Great Northern companies: (D) All patent privilege contracts and other contracts containing clauses regarding patent privileges should be notified for cancellation immediately. (E) The Ministry of Communications should notify the two companies that the landing and connection contracts can be maintained until 1930, i.e., the end of the 19th year of the Republic. All submarine cables installed within Chinese territorial waters shall be owned by China and taken over by the Ministry of Communications of the National Government. In the event that negotiations result in the cables still needing to be managed by the companies after 1930, and the right to land and connect cannot be cancelled, then the following conditions are the minimum requirements and must be acknowledged by the companies: (1) They must obtain a special permit for landing from the Ministry of Communications of the National Government and pay a fixed rent. (2) The company is only allowed to relay overseas telegrams. (3) They are not allowed to directly receive and send telegrams. (4) The company should maintain the submarine cables in perfect condition, and if there is any damage or obstruction, they must be repaired promptly. (5) Increase the telegraph fees due to China. (6) In the event of major domestic or international incidents, the National Government reserves the right to send personnel to inspect and supervise, and temporarily take over the operation. (7) The above special permission is limited to a period of two years. It has been investigated that Zhuang Zhihuan's summary of the negotiations regarding telecommunications submarine cables stated that the most important six points were agreed upon, including (1) the validity period of the landing permit is from five to ten years, etc. It has been investigated that the landing of submarine cables is not explicitly stipulated in the contract but is only marked in official documents. Now, Zhuang Zhihuan has proposed this condition, which is to provide a layer of protection for the landing patent right that has never been stipulated in the contract. Not only has the landing patent right not been cancelled in the contract, but the protection of the landing patent right has been increased in the contract. This violates the Ministry of Communications' claim that no government, company, or individual of any country will be granted exclusive rights to land submarine cables in the future, and it also fails to comply with the Ministry of Communications' proposed method of canceling all patent privileges. Nothing could be worse than this surrender of national rights. Even if concessions are made in negotiations, they should comply with Clause 7 of Item E of the Ministry of Communications, which limits the special permission period to two years. On what basis did Zhuang Zhihuan make concessions to five to ten years? Once the company has obtained a license, then within five or ten years, all landing patent rights will not only not be cancelled in fact, but also be protected by law. If this agreement is finalized, then within these five or ten years, our country will lose its sovereignty over communications, which will be no different from before. Furthermore, it has been investigated that the Ministry of Communications proposed a solution: (C) The Ministry of Communications should notify the two companies to immediately recover all borrowed lines, and take over all agency submarine cables by the end of this year (i.e., the end of the 19th year). Now, Zhuang Zhihuan first stated that the connection from the submarine cable landing point to the Shanghai company's operations room should be borrowed by the Department of Electrical Affairs of the Ministry of Communications for the company's use, and the Department of Electrical Affairs should be responsible for repairs and maintenance. Then, he stated that only the necessary lines should be connected to the company's operations and submarine cables, and the rest should be managed and used by our country's telegraph bureau. The Ministry of Communications proposed a solution, advocating that all borrowed lines should be recovered and taken over independently, but Zhuang Zhihuan actually allowed the company to borrow them, which clearly contradicts the Ministry of Communications' method of recovering all borrowed lines and agency submarine cables. Moreover, the standard for what constitutes a 'necessary line' has not been clearly specified, which will undoubtedly be determined by the company. If it is determined by the company, then which line is not a necessary line, i.e., which line is not a borrowed line, and the Ministry of Communications' so-called recovery and Zhuang Zhihuan's so-called 'the rest shall be managed and used by our country's telegraph bureau' will all become empty words. Any line borrowed by the company is a line that our country cannot directly manage. If this is the case, then the autonomy of international communications will be completely lost again. Furthermore, it has been investigated that the Ministry of Communications proposed a solution: (E) The former Qing government allowed the company to install submarine cables in our country's territorial waters without permission, and unconditionally allowed them to land and connect cables and operate freely. Such provisions that humiliated the country and harmed its rights should not be bound by the status of today's National Government. Therefore, in the minimum conditions, it is proposed that the company shall not be allowed to directly receive and send telegrams. If the company is not allowed to directly receive and send telegrams, then the right to receive and deliver telegrams should be taken back by the Ministry of Communications and exercised freely. Now, Zhuang Zhihuan first advocated that the matters of delivery and reception should be entrusted to the company by the Chinese government and supervised by personnel, and a sign of the Chinese Telegraph Bureau could be hung outside the building. Then, he advocated that the reception and dispatch matters should be handled entirely by our country's telegraph bureau, and the company's current employees could be entrusted to gain proficiency. The so-called hanging of the Chinese Telegraph Bureau's sign outside the building indicates that the internal organization will remain unchanged. The so-called company's current employees can be entrusted, which indicates that our country's personnel and administrative power will be restricted. This kind of perfunctory approach will not only make neighboring countries laugh but also embarrass our people. Foreigners enjoy the benefits of free business operations, while our country enjoys the empty name of receiving and sending telegrams. What is the purpose of making such concessions? In summary, the issue of apportioning telegraph fees has not been reported, and the losses involved, based only on what is known from hearsay, are that compared to the old contract, the reporting from the negotiating authorities believes that the annual increase in revenue is one million yuan, but in reality, there will still be losses of two to three million yuan or more. It has been investigated that in the old contract, the Chinese side received thirty-eight and a half centimes per word for apportioning telegraph fees. In the current draft contract, there are two types of fees: inland and Shanghai. The inland fee is sixty centimes, and the Shanghai fee is thirty-one centimes (a reduction of three and a half centimes compared to the old contract). According to the actual situation and business conditions, the Shanghai telegraph fees must be carefully calculated by experts in order to know the exact amount. Regarding the ratio between the inland and Shanghai fees, it is 80% to 20%. It is necessary to study the gains and losses in this regard. (The several points mentioned in the telegraph above are all important key points, and the other minor issues are too numerous to mention.) Now, on the day when the contract is being revised, it is the time when our country is recovering the autonomy of international communications that has been lost for fifty years. What is Zhuang Zhihuan doing? How dare he make one mistake after another, leading to the failure of the negotiations to this point? It can be seen that the accusations from the outside world are not without reason. Such dereliction of duty and surrender of rights should be impeached in accordance with Article 2 of the Impeachment Law. Is this appropriate? We request that it be submitted for review in accordance with the law."</p>
<p>Review Report Members: Gao Youtang, Shao Hongji, Zhou Lisheng</p>
<p>The review report on the impeachment case of Zhuang Zhihuan is as follows: "It is submitted for reporting. The President of the Yuan has assigned the impeachment case of Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Department of Electrical Affairs of the Ministry of Communications, for dereliction of duty and surrender of rights in handling international telecommunications and water and electricity negotiations, which was proposed by the three members Liu, Gao, and [unclear], to be reviewed by the three of us, Youtang, Hongji, and Lisheng. Youtang and others have carefully reviewed the original case and various related documents and unanimously believe that the allegations of dereliction of duty and surrender of rights against Zhuang Zhihuan in the original impeachment case are based on solid evidence and clear circumstances. Therefore, it should be submitted for disciplinary action in accordance with the law. Before the establishment of the disciplinary organs for officials, a rapid remedy of dismissal from office should be presented to the National Government in accordance with Article 7 of the Impeachment Law, and disciplinary action should be submitted after the establishment of the disciplinary organs for officials. All review opinions are compiled into a report in accordance with Article 7 of the Control Yuan Review Rules and submitted for review and implementation. It has been investigated that Zhuang Zhihuan has now been transferred to the position of Counselor by the Ministry of Communications. Although he has been removed from the position of Director of the Department of Electrical Affairs, he should still be removed from his current position and cannot avoid it due to the transfer. This is stated in combination."</p>
<p>Letter from the Bureau of Civil Affairs: The Bureau of Civil Affairs of the National Government sent a public letter to the Control Yuan, stating confidentially: "Having received Chairman's letter from Zhuang Zhihuan, presenting the handling of telecommunications submarine cable negotiations, being subject to unwarranted criticism, and respectfully submitting a summary of the negotiation process, earnestly requesting fairness and a thorough investigation of this case. According to the submitted summary and the negotiation outline of the Pacific Business Submarine Cable Company forwarded by the Executive Yuan, it is very different from the solution proposed by the Ministry of Communications in May of the 18th year and the secret submission of the negotiation process and future coping methods in October of the 19th year. Since Zhuang Zhihuan has requested a fair and thorough investigation, the entire case should be handed over to the Control Yuan for a thorough investigation and verification, and the Executive Yuan should be instructed to instruct the Ministry of Communications to be extra cautious about the progress of negotiations, to promptly seek remedies, and not to lose national rights in the slightest. The handling situation should be reported in detail at any time, etc. In addition to separate dispatches, the corresponding full volume is enclosed with a detailed list."</p>
<p>Zhuang Zhihuan's Letter: Zhuang Zhihuan's letter to Chairman Jiang Yun states: "Chairman, respectfully, it has been investigated that in November of last year, several people including Chen Yiyan accused Zhihuan of handling telecommunications submarine cable negotiations.</p>

<h3 id="e32">The German Political Tide Suddenly Becomes Serious <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Just when the German authorities are facing economic difficulties and urgently seeking compromise with neighboring countries in order to save themselves, the various political parties within the country believe that the authorities are disregarding the suffering of the people and that the emergency orders are too harsh. There is a sudden shift in the political situation. This further plunges the authorities into a dilemma. The German government, unable to remedy the financial shortage, has had no choice but to seek assistance from Britain on the one hand, hoping to revise the Young Plan to reduce its external burden, and on the other hand, to issue emergency orders to increase new taxes in order to balance government revenue and expenditure. This was originally the government's desperate attempt to save itself in a situation where it had no other choice. However, looking at its external hopes now, they are still in the realm of the unattainable. The political parties on the left and right within the country, as well as the various provincial groups, have risen up to unanimously resist the government's orders. According to a telegram from Berlin, after Brüning's return to Germany, there will be a major change internally. Demonstrations have already broken out in various places. This situation is sufficient to deal a major blow to the government's diplomatic efforts. Whether diplomacy is successful or not depends on the means of the diplomatic authorities, as well as on the stability of the domestic political situation. An unstable domestic political situation makes it easy for foreigners to observe and make excuses, which will stagnate diplomacy. Therefore, the German government today is in a position where it cannot but revise the emergency orders. On the party side, unless they are extreme advocates who want to overthrow the government and then be happy, they should not take excessive measures today, which would lead the country to an unmanageable predicament.</p>

<p>Reuter's, New York, 10th: U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon departs for Europe today. Naturally, there is much speculation regarding the purpose of his trip. When asked, Mellon tersely replied that he does not wish to discuss war debts or reparations, and that his sole purpose is to visit his son at Oxford University.</p>
<p>Electric Communication, New York, 10th: U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon's sudden departure for Europe today has caused quite a stir. It goes without saying that his trip is directly related to the recent Anglo-German meeting. It is possible that the originally anticipated meeting of U.S. Secretary of State Stimson and British Foreign Secretary Henderson with German leaders in Berlin may now materialize. Although Mr. Mellon stated before his departure that it was unrelated to war debts and reparations, sources from the government suggest that Mr. Mellon may directly discuss the matter with German representatives. With the Young Plan as its focus, the atmosphere in European and American political circles is becoming increasingly active.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 10th: Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius returned to Berlin from England this afternoon. Accompanying them was U.S. Ambassador Sackett, who was invited to Germany by the Chancellor. When the Chancellor and his party departed from Bremerhaven to return to Berlin, a small group of National Socialists shouted slogans such as "Germany Wake Up! Death to Brüning!", leading to the arrest of several individuals. A similar incident occurred at the Friedrichstrasse station. Upon arriving in Berlin, the Chancellor convened a cabinet meeting that evening to report on the trip.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Berlin, 10th: The Associated Press has learned that Germany does not wish to join a European group to jointly confront the United States on the war debt issue. Instead, it will seek assistance from the United States to rescue its economic and financial crisis. Although the German government is urgently seeking the swift implementation of a three-year moratorium on reparations payments, it has no intention of implementing it before U.S. Secretary of State Stimson arrives in Germany. Mr. Stimson is currently scheduled to arrive in Berlin on July 21st for a one-week stay. British Foreign Secretary Henderson is also expected to arrive in Germany at the same time. At that time, the three countries' leaders will undoubtedly engage in discussions regarding the payment of war debts and reparations. It is expected that there will be subsequent consultations between Germany and France, and between Germany and Italy. When U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon arrives in Europe, Germany is also expected to have diplomatic representatives contact him. Germany currently hopes that the meetings of important figures from various countries will result in an international reparations conference.</p>
<p>National, Rome, 10th: Italian public opinion has paid close attention to the Anglo-German Chequers meeting from the beginning. Now that the meeting has concluded, the newspapers place great emphasis on the increased friendship between England and Germany, and dismiss the pessimism of certain foreign newspapers as unfounded. As for the French Foreign Minister's statement that the Young Plan is inviolable, the Messaggero newspaper considers it insignificant, as Briand himself has repeatedly stated that he will continue his policy of reconciliation with Germany.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 10th: After Chancellor Brüning's return to Germany, significant changes are expected in domestic politics. Although the parliament is currently in recess, the opposition parties on both the left and right have proposed convening parliament, which was dismissed today by the parliament's standing committee. However, since the issuance of the emergency decree, there has been obvious unrest within the country. The fact that it has not yet materialized is only to provide an opportunity for the various factions in parliament to consider it. Moreover, the measures adopted by the government are considered by the public to be too harsh. This is undeniable. In the future, when various factions rise up in opposition to the government, it is feared that the government will rely solely on the Centre Party. A political storm is brewing. Various labor unions, provincial organizations, war veterans, and so on have convened meetings in recent days and passed various protests, claiming that the suffering of the people has not only reached its limit but has also exceeded the possible range. All of this is forcing the various political parties to adopt a definite strategy. Therefore, parties such as the Democratic Party and the Economic Party have recognized in meetings that this emergency decree needs to be amended. Other parties, such as the Social Democratic Party, the largest party in Germany, and the Nationalist Party, have scheduled meetings for Friday to discuss this matter. The fate of the emergency decree hinges on this.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 11th: Although the political world is currently focused on the outcome of the Anglo-German meeting, the domestic situation has suddenly become serious after Chancellor Brüning and his party returned to the country. Demonstrations against the recent emergency decree have taken place throughout the country. In many major cities such as Frankfurt and Hamburg, unemployed workers have rioted due to hunger, marching in crowds and seizing bread and food along the way. When the police intervened, bloody conflicts often resulted. The government has been forced to abandon everything else and focus on resolving this matter. The Chancellor has invited the leaders of the major political parties to meet this afternoon and evening, hoping to reach a compromise on the emergency decree, make slight changes to it, and avoid further political turmoil so that cabinet members can focus on planning financial and economic relief programs.</p>

<h3 id="e68">New Invention: Tubercle Bacillus Delipidification Technique <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(1) (Translated from the latest German Journal of Tuberculosis)</p>
<p>Since Dr. Koch discovered the tubercle bacillus as the pathogen of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption), tuberculosis scholars in the East and West have striven to study it, hoping to find a wonderful way to kill this bacillus. However, the results have all ended in failure. This is because general physicians in the past did not understand the special structure of tubercle bacilli, thinking that all bacteria could be killed with disinfectant medicines, either by internal administration or injection, just like injecting "606" for syphilis. It was only after Dr. Bergell's painstaking research that he published that tubercle bacilli have a special defense force that can resist attacks from all external medicinal forces. This is because tubercle bacilli are composed of a neutral fat inner membrane and an acid-fast wax outer membrane (Llipoid). Unless a way is found to destroy its wax defense line and disarm its fatty armament, there is no way to capture tubercle bacilli and put them to death. Moreover, when tubercle bacilli invade a local part of the human body, their surroundings are eroded to form stubborn nodules that obstruct the passage of blood flow, causing the general disinfectant medicines injected or taken internally to be unable to cross the threshold. Just like a specially martial-lawed restricted area, medicinal power cannot reach the affected area. Therefore, even if the whole body is immersed in a medicine pool, it cannot harm the hair of the tubercle bacilli. Therefore, the only combat strategy to eliminate tubercle bacilli must at least have the following two decisive conditions:</p>
<p>(1) The medicinal power must be able to destroy the nodules and reach the affected area directly.</p>
<p>(2) It must also be able to strip or dissolve the waxy and fatty inner and outer membranes.</p>
<p>Only in this way can it achieve the success of breaking through barriers and slaying generals. Otherwise, it is like scratching an itch through boots. Under these two guarantees, the tubercle bacilli secretly laugh at people's inability to harm them.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Hammershaly and Terebensky discovered that the acid-fastness of tubercle bacilli is due to the ability of wax to resist acid. Therefore, they applied 5% to 10% caustic potash solution to remove the acid-fast wax of tubercle bacilli. Later, Moussn and Goupjl applied chlorine gas to remove the acid-fast wax. However, this delipidification method can only be applied to staining methods for microscopic examination, because its medicinal properties are highly toxic and ultimately cannot be practically applied to the human body.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been occasional cases where chaulmoogra oil has been applied to leprosy and achieved unexpected results. This is because leprosy bacilli and tubercle bacilli are acid-fast bacteria of the same nature, and chaulmoogra oil has the effect of delipidification and has a bactericidal power more than a hundred times that of carbolic acid. As a result, general scholars have aroused enthusiastic attention and thought of applying chaulmoogra oil to patients with tuberculosis in hopes of achieving results. They used various chemical methods to extract the main components of chaulmoogra oil. However, it is only limited to skin and superficial tuberculosis and can achieve good results. For deep organ tuberculosis, such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys, it still cannot achieve any effect.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Therefore, Dr. Bergell, the great teacher of tuberculosis patients all over the world, went a step further, collecting various medicinal substances of animal, plant, and mineral origin and painstakingly researching them, hoping to obtain a delipidifying effect without the various shortcomings of chaulmoogra oil. He worked tirelessly for decades, wondering how much brainpower and effort he had exhausted to seek the most rational and purest chemical agent. Finally, he discovered that in the compressed juice of the mesenteric glands of special animals, there is a certain effective ingredient that has a strong delipidifying effect on tubercle bacilli. He immediately applied this new ingredient to tubercle bacilli and performed the Ziehl-Neelsen staining method. It no longer stained red but stained blue. This result is completely the same as other non-acid-fast bacteria. Since then, the claim that it is impossible to artificially remove the acid-fastness of tubercle bacilli, which was regarded by physicians in the East and West, has been completely overturned. He seized the highest authority in delipidifying bactericides and experimented with this compound on various types of tuberculosis in animals and humans, and all achieved great miraculous effects without side effects. This is really a new dawn in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, a major question in the medical community for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Structural diagram of tubercle bacilli</p>
<p>Lungs of patients with lung disease</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>After the etiology and pathology of pulmonary tuberculosis were clarified, Dr. Bergell's great medical saint's invented new medical theory on the ideal treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis was also experimented and achieved great success. "Sanosin," the only and unparalleled special medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis in the 20th century, was produced in accordance with this new medical theory and new doctrine, opening up a new record in the medical community. The main components contained in "Sanosin" are listed below.</p>
<p>The chemical name of the first ingredient is Aminoaethylsulfonsaeure (C2h7nso3), which is extracted from the mesenteric gland liver of special animals and the blood of marine mollusks. Its chemical properties are colorless and transparent, and it is a shiny tetrad or hexad crystal. At 12 degrees Celsius, it can dissolve in 16 times of cold water, and it is easier to dissolve in hot water, but it cannot dissolve in anhydrous alcohol and ether. If it is boiled with a strong saline solution, it becomes acetic acid and sulfuric acid. When fused with mercury, it forms a white powder that is insoluble in water. If it is decomposed at 240 degrees Celsius and mixed more closely with several parts of soda ash, it is heated on a platinum plate to produce a residue. According to the experimental report of Dr. Sohroder, this ingredient can directly act on tubercle bacilli and dissolve the wax and fat of its outer membrane. Once the tubercle bacillus loses this strategic barrier, it cannot avoid its death penalty. Moreover, this ingredient also has a considerable stimulating effect, which can increase the secretion of bile in patients, and the function of metabolism becomes more vigorous. For lung diseases, it can also change its connective tissue and achieve a therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>The second ingredient is KalllumSulfoouaiecolloum (C6Ｈ5ＯＨ)(OCH)2So2OK, created by Dr. Tiemsnn, which can enhance the resistance of tuberculosis patients and the coagulation power of serum, promote metabolism, increase white blood cells, prevent the development of tubercle bacilli, and has the special functions of strengthening the stomach, eliminating phlegm, and disinfecting. Therefore, since Dr. Reichenbach, a famous modern tuberculosis physician, advocated its application in pulmonary tuberculosis, physicians in Germany and the United Kingdom have regarded this ingredient as the supreme sacred product for the treatment of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>"Sanosin," a new medicine, is made by combining the above two major valuable main ingredients. Therefore, "Sanosin" is an unprecedented special new medicine for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, which indeed has great value. The therapeutic effects are listed below.</p>
<p>(1) When the medicinal power of "Sanosin" is tested in a test tube, tubercle bacilli all lose their acid-fastness after one minute, and after three minutes, the pulmonary tuberculosis bacilli are completely killed without exception.</p>
<p>(2) When "Sanosin" is applied to the human body by internal administration or injection, it can penetrate into the interior of various organs such as the lungs. After 18 hours, examination of the urine can reveal the reaction of DIBZO. After 48 hours, this reaction disappears, and white blood cells increase significantly.</p>
<p>(3) According to animal experiments, "Sanosin" can penetrate into the tuberculosis lesions. When examining the latent tubercle bacilli in the lesions, they all lose their acid-fastness. This proves that its wax is completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(4) After taking "Sanosin" internally for about a week, you can see the dilution of sputum, the decrease in body heat, and the pleasant state of mind and body. (5) If you continue to take "Sanosin" internally for more than one or two months, you can clearly see the weight gain, the appetite is stimulated, all symptoms are gradually alleviated, and finally, the great power of turning the tide is achieved.</p>
<p>Free Sanosin experimental report and guide to pulmonary disease treatment will be sent upon request.</p>

<p>, humiliation of national sovereignty, and requested their dismissal and punishment. I then realized that the main reason for their actions was that they had ulterior motives. Before the Fourth Plenary Session, Zhihuan did hear that those in the electrical industry who were dissatisfied with Zhihuan were secretly meeting in Shanghai and plotting something. He reported this to the Minister, believing that the telecommunications business and negotiations with the cable companies were important, and that his personal career was light, and that he might as well retire cleanly to make way for a more capable person. At that time, the Minister instructed him that negotiations were important and ordered him to continue to be responsible. They then falsely used the name of supporting national sovereignty and arbitrarily sent telegrams and broadcast pamphlets to damage Zhihuan's reputation and threatened him with alarming words, hoping to achieve their conspiracy. Zhihuan, as a party member, has always valued discipline and is an administrative official who respects national sovereignty. How could he dare to act so brazenly as to isolate himself from the party and the country and from the people? Therefore, he expressed in the telegram that if there was any attempt to harm the public for personal gain, the party constitution and national law were there, and he was willing to fulfill his oath and be subjected to the most severe punishment. This sincere heart can be witnessed by heaven and earth. Now, I respectfully submit an abridged version of the negotiation process as a report and present it in detail to the Chairman. Zhihuan was ordered in the autumn of the 17th year to take charge of telecommunications and began preparing for the cable negotiations in the 19th year. First, he was approved to organize an International Telecommunications Negotiation Discussion Group, recruited experts, and requested the relevant ministries and commissions to appoint commissioners to serve as members to study concrete plans in preparation for dealing with them. Fearing that negotiations would break down and that our country's international communications could not be interrupted for a day, he suggested building a large international communications radio station. At that time, the Construction Commission and the Ministry of Communications were competing for the power to run the wireless business for several months. After that, domestic wars continued, and the telecommunications economy was exhausted. The large international radio station encountered many difficulties and was finally completed on December 6th last year, but it was several months after the scheduled opening date and failed to reveal its achievements to the world as soon as possible, so as to promote the awareness of the cable companies, which is a pity. As for the cable negotiations, Zhihuan expected from the beginning that it would be difficult to win this negotiation, in which one country confronted the combined front of four countries, and that he would inevitably be criticized for being in the line of fire. Therefore, at the beginning of the negotiations, he telegraphed the national electrical industry, contributing opinions at any time in the hope of collective wisdom and strength. At the same time, he knew that as a party member, he only knew to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions and had a fearless spirit to fight for the country. Other than that, there were a few people who were usually dissatisfied with the telecommunications austerity policy and were punished for official business, who secretly used the trick of provocation and sowing discord, falsely using the name of the telecommunications workers' unions of various provinces to make malicious attacks. The electrical industry is originally a loose organization, and it is difficult to get support for good policies, and no one declares the borrowing, and the people of the society do not know the truth, and they are shocked. Zhihuan alone became the target of public criticism. At that time, it was at a critical juncture in the negotiations, but he did not want to argue about personal issues and disregard the dignity of the country, so that the negotiations would be affected, and he was helpless and unable to be free. Fortunately, the negotiations have come to an end, and all the processes of Zhihuan's handling of the negotiations have been generously understood by the government officials. His private gratitude cannot be described. However, Zhihuan has been subjected to unreasonable criticism and has endured it for several months. He has been injured by the day-to-day confusion of right and wrong and has been unable to stand on his own. He deeply believes that scholars can be killed but not humiliated, and he dares not avoid axes and swords. He earnestly asks the Chairman to uphold justice and quickly thoroughly investigate this case fairly, so that the truth will come out, the doubts of the public can be dispelled, and Zhihuan will be loyal and diligent, in order to answer the deepness. In the future, all progress will be given by the Chairman. At the end of the article, he is terrified and wants to say more, and respectfully asks for his safety, and asks him to examine it."</p>

<h3 id="e72">Request by Chambers of Commerce in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province to Revise the Business Tax Law <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>And Request for Temporary Suspension of Promulgation and Implementation</p>
<p>The Business Tax Law has been drafted and passed by the Legislative Yuan. Chambers of Commerce in various counties of Jiangsu Province believe that the articles of the tax law greatly violate the General Outline for Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces decided by the Central Political Council, and the supplementary measures formulated by the Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, they failed to accommodate the repeated petitions from Chambers of Commerce in various counties of Jiangsu Province. Therefore, it was decided that the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce would again submit a joint petition to the Central Political Council, the National Government, and the Legislative Yuan, requesting that the passed Business Tax Law be revised separately based on the principles decided upon. The original telegram is recorded below: "As reported, the Business Tax Law passed by the Legislative Yuan, such as Article 4 of the original text, stipulates that the business tax rate should be 2/1000 to 10/1000 of the total business revenue as the standard, and 4/1000 to 10/1000 of the business capital as the standard, which exceeds the range stipulated in Article 4 of the General Outline for Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces, that the business tax rate should be calculated using the per mille method according to the tax standard, and should not exceed 2/1000 at most, and some rates are as high as ten times that amount. Article 10 stipulates that the original Tooth Tax, Pawn Tax, Slaughter Tax, and other business taxes in various provinces and cities that should be banned or levied by means of prohibition according to law may be temporarily changed to business tax according to the original tax rate, which also contradicts Article 7 of the General Outline for Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces, which stipulates that after the implementation of the business tax, all the original tooth certificate tax, pawn certificate tax, slaughter tax, etc. in various provinces, as well as other taxes and levies with the same nature as the business tax, should be abolished, and Article 11 of the supplementary measures formulated by the Ministry of Finance, that although tooth tax, pawn tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes and levies with the same nature as the business tax must be merged separately in accordance with the outline, in order to temporarily take care of local revenue, it can be handled in two steps. The first step is to change the name of tooth, pawn, slaughter, and other taxes to business tax, and the tax rate is still levied according to the original tax rate of tooth, pawn, and slaughter taxes as a temporary transitional measure. The second step is to change the above-mentioned original tax rate to business tax rate after the business tax is handled properly, so as to unify the regulations, which are also inconsistent. This clearly violates the meaning of the General Outline for Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces decided by the 270th Central Political Council and the principles of the supplementary measures formulated by the Ministry of Finance, and the legislation contains fixedness, and the use of the words 'temporary' is also not seen in legal texts, which seems inappropriate. This should be specifically corrected. In accordance with the principles decided by the Central Political Council, it seems that the important regulations of the General Outline for Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces and the supplementary measures formulated by the Ministry of Finance, such as Article 6 of the supplementary measures formulated by the Ministry of Finance, that for businesses that sell goods, and the amount of business income is used as the tax standard, the tax rate for wholesale business can be appropriately reduced compared to retail business, and Article 12 that the field tax in various provinces originally has the distinction between provincial tax and county tax, and since the business tax comes from the county people, its burden nature is the same as the field tax. In the future, how much of the business tax collected should be allocated and retained for county use, and the provincial government should consider the loss of the county and properly allocate it, and the money allocated should be used first for the undertakings that have insufficient funds due to the reduction of the tax, so that they can be continued, etc., should be adopted as much as possible when formulating the Business Tax Law and clearly stipulated, so as to reflect the spirit of the Central Government's decision that day. This should be ordered to be supplemented. In addition, Article 4 of the Business Tax Law passed by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that the business tax rate, with the amount of net business income as the standard, the tax rate is changed to a percentage, at least 2% and up to 10%, which is beyond the scope of the General Outline for Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces and the supplementary measures formulated by the Ministry of Finance approved by the Central Political Council. Its nature is similar to income tax. I don't know which businesses can apply the net income tax assessment, and there is no clear provision, which is easy to cause disputes. This should be ordered to be clearly stipulated. Furthermore, the main point of the repeated petitions of the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce is that the business tax, in terms of its nature, is a behavior tax, and should only be taxed equally based on whether the behavior exists or not. After our country's tax reduction, the central government has mostly separately changed to unified tax for various important commodities, and the unified tax rate mostly uses a percentage, which is higher than the previous tax. If the provinces levy business tax on their behavior again, it seems to be a double tax, and the tax rate itself cannot</p>

<p>Try hard to reduce it. Therefore, in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the central government convened a meeting to reduce taxes and decided that the business tax rate should be calculated using the per mille method according to the tax standard, and should not exceed 2/1000 at most. If it is called per mille, but the tax rate is above 10/1000, it is avoiding the name of percentage and using the reality of percentage, which is absolutely unbearable for merchants. The commerce of Jiangsu Province is closely related to that of Shanghai. If the measures for the business tax in Jiangsu Province are slightly different from those in Shanghai, it will inevitably affect the prosperity of inland commerce and put merchants in a more deadly situation. There are a total of two points, detailed in the original petition, which should be taken into consideration. The important principles of the business tax in Shanghai, as reported, are five items: 1. The tax rate should not exceed 3/1000 at most, calculated by rounding. 2. Tax collection does not distinguish between Chinese and foreign merchants, and the tax amount does not distinguish between domestic and foreign goods. 3. Wholesale businesses are levied at 1/4 of the rate. Manufacturers who directly retail their manufactured goods still pay tax according to the tax rate stipulated for manufacturing, and are not subject to additional business tax for sales. 4. Brokers who accept entrustment to act as agents are exempt from business tax. 5. If the business operator reports the amount of business, and it is certified by an accountant or chamber of commerce, the investigation procedure can be exempted. The business tax law passed by the Legislative Yuan has higher tax rates than those in Shanghai, and it may be difficult to force Shanghai to cut its feet to fit the shoes. The measures for everything, regarding the decision of the Central Political Council, should pay attention to not disturbing the people and not hindering commercial development, and it is not as thorough as Shanghai, which will inevitably hinder the development of inland commerce and make it impossible for merchants to operate. This should be rescued. It concerns the creation of a new tax and violates the decision-making principles. Our association and other representatives of merchants, are concerned about the current interests and the life and death in the future, it is really difficult to remain silent. I am using another telegram to state, I beg you to examine the Legislative Yuan to revise separately based on the decision-making principles and temporarily delay the implementation in order to protect the commercial business and avoid the hindrance, I am very grateful to be waiting for your order."</p>

<p>Suicide of a Traveler in the Datong Hotel. A person from Shaxi went to the Datong Hotel at Zhengyang Bridge on the 9th and claimed to be Qian Zhonghe, 24 years old, a primary school teacher. The porter led him to Room 6 to rest. At 10 pm, he closed the door and went to sleep. Qian felt that the environment was bad and suddenly had the thought of leaving the world. He committed suicide by taking poison. Until 1 pm on the 10th, the porter went to knock on the door. After calling for a long time, there was no response. Knowing that there was a change, he managed to pry open the door and saw Qian lying stiffly in bed with a pale face. Knowing that he had taken poison, he immediately reported to the accounting room and reported to the Public Security Bureau. Qian was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, he had taken anesthetic powder. Fortunately, the amount taken was small, and his life could be saved. However, it was still difficult to wake up for a while, so he remained in the hospital. Qian's relative, Mr. Wu, urgently sent a letter to his family to come to Kunshan.</p>
<p>Unlawful Police Officer Sent to the County Government for Punishment. Luo Qixiang, the captain of the Kunshan County Police Team, usually restrained his subordinates, which was quite strict. However, the police officers often had conflicts with people when they went out. On the 10th, a police officer Cai, dressed in plain clothes, boarded a ship to Qian Dun without a ticket. The ticket seller, unaware that Cai was a police officer, ordered him to buy a ticket in accordance with the regulations. Cai not only refused to buy a ticket, but also beat the ticket seller severely. The passengers on the same ship were in an uproar. Wang Liang, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, stepped forward to dissuade him, and was insulted and scolded by Cai. Wang saw that there was no reasoning, and called the police officer to accompany the police officer to the Public Security Bureau Substation on the road to explain the ins and outs to Inspector Lu Zhongying. The police officer beat Director Wang again. Inspector Lu believed that the police officer was unreasonable and sent the police officer to the County Police Team Department. After Captain Luo inquired about the previous situation, he believed that the police officer had no regard for the law and immediately dismissed him. He was sent to the Public Security Bureau again. After Director Qin briefly interrogated him, he submitted a document to the county government on the 11th for legal action.</p>

<p>Horrifying News of Strangling Children to Death in the Middle of the Night. Sun Haoming, a resident of Shituwan East Street, District 16 (Wan'an City), used to open Wanfeng Jinghuo Store in the town. Later, due to poor business, he had to close down. Sun is now 47 years old and has three sons and one daughter, and is addicted to opium pills. The eldest son, Ye Sun, 26 years old, is also addicted to opium pills. He married the daughter of Zhang Zixian of Xizhang. He has one son and one daughter. He used to work in the fruit shop opened by his father-in-law in Suzhou. Because his father-in-law smoked opium pills, he was very lazy in his work, so he resigned the year before last. After Ye Sun returned home, he still did not repent and still associated with opium pills. His father, Haoming, hated him for this, so he often beat Ye Sun. The night before yesterday, he locked him in the bathroom with iron chains, and then strangled him to death with hemp rope with his daughter, Yue Xian.

<p>County Government Convenes a Meeting on Business Tax. The Wuxi Rice Industry Association recently saw in the newspaper that the Zhejiang rice industry has been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to exempt rice from business tax, as rice is an essential item for people's livelihood. The cases of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are the same, and Wujin and other counties have already telegraphed to the ministries and provinces, requesting exemption. Therefore, they are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude on the recognition and payment of business tax. The Wuxi Business Tax Bureau believes that the opening of business tax is imminent, and the amount recognized and paid by various industries has a rough idea. It is difficult for the rice industry to be unique. It specially discussed with County Magistrate Pan and the Provincial Committee, and Director Yang of the Business Tax Bureau, and invited Zhao Zixin and other leaders of the eight sections of the rice industry, and all standing members of the County Chamber of Commerce, to hold a meeting at the County Government yesterday (11th) afternoon to discuss and solve the problem as soon as possible.

However, after a long time, the amount of bonds reported and released by the counties was still very small. The Construction Bond Fund Management Committee sent a letter requesting the department to select competent personnel to bring construction bond tickets and go to various counties to help promote sales. In fact, there are many difficulties. It is only necessary to inform the counties to entrust the sale of a certain amount, and immediately report the mail for approval by the hall. The bonds will be issued immediately and forwarded to the purchaser for collection in order to strengthen the public's trust. Therefore, it has instructed the county magistrates to comply with the previous orders and to promote the sale of construction bonds as soon as possible and raise the full amount in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Continuous Occurrence of Cattle Theft Cases. Since the beginning of spring in this county, cattle theft cases have occurred everywhere. Although the police局 has conducted thorough investigations, it is still difficult to solve the cases. A few days ago, Zhang Hongquan, a cattle dealer, recently bought six heads from Nanshan in preparation for sale. Unexpectedly, in the thunderstorm last night, they were suddenly stolen. By the time they were discovered, it was too late to chase them. Fortunately, the two cattle lost by Wang Gouxang's family in the seventh vice-district yesterday were intercepted by neighbors halfway and were able to be saved. Others such as Zhang Tang Wang Xingmei, Wattana Lu Caizhong, Salt Industry You Quansheng and other families, have also been visited by thieves one after another, suffering huge losses. It is said that there are many fellow parties in the group, and the method of stealing is extremely clever. The place where they steal is mostly the junction of the two counties and the seawall, so it is easy to escape, so the arrest is particularly difficult. Li Zhibin, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, has taken this into consideration. In addition to patrolling the main ports of water and land, and checking, he also sent letters to neighboring counties yesterday to investigate together.</p>

Now, the bandit leader Wei Yousan was pursued by the troops stationed in northern Anhui in a hurry and fled back to Jiangsu Province, searching for Baowei and other places, and joined forces with the bandit Liu Ershuizi and others, with about 500 people, wantonly harassing. As a result, the villagers at the junction of Su and Si counties dare not harvest wheat and are difficult to block. Liang Guanying, the general commander of the 20th Shilu Army, heard the news and thought that since the green gauze tent period was approaching and the villagers were busy with farming, if they were not severely suppressed, it would be difficult to deal with the deep roots.

<p>The Whole Province Business Tax Collection Started Yesterday. After the abolition of tax reduction and the change to business tax collection in this province, it has been nearly four months. All rules and tax rates have been revised and the investigation of all seven district bureaus has been completed in nearly two months. However, because the collection procedures are quite complicated, they have not yet started to be collected. It is now known that the Finance Department of each district bureau has decided to start collection from yesterday (11th). According to the Finance Department's budget, it can collect 2 million yuan per year, which is more than the previous unified donation.</p>
<p>Provincial Bureau Executed Bandits from Two Counties by Firing Squad. Xiang Hengmi, a bandit from Lin'an, colluded with escaped bandit Xiang Hengyu and Zhou Dongzhou, Zhu Agun and others who were killed by the security team in July 18th. The four of them went to Bao Yizhuan's house in Fenglinshan, intending to kidnap the head of the family. Unexpectedly, Bao Yizhuan was not at home and kidnapped his daughter Bao Gongqin and looted clothes, quilts and other items, extorting 500 yuan. He also robbed more than a dozen pieces of clothing and a pig from the home of Zhou Jinzhao, a resident of Longkou Stone. He extorted the family of Zhou Jinzhao. Zhou Chen's eyes were beaten and injured, and the head of the family, Zhou Jinzhao, was kidnapped and held for 100 yuan. Later, Xiang Hengmi was arrested by the Hengtian security team, and two homemade guns, a revolver, and four bullets were found in his home. He was sent to the Lin'an County Village Clearing Bureau for interrogation, and confessed to the kidnapping. Li Baokui and Hu Baomei, bandits from Yongjia County, were arrested along with the bandit leader Zheng Jizuo on the 9th. They kidnapped Chen Weiyan's child Jin Zhencan and extorted a ransom. The two counties have submitted requests to the Provincial Village Clearing Bureau for approval, and the reply was to execute them by firing squad.</p>

<p>Brief Notes on the Game of Weiqi – Chen Boying</p>
<p>During the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, there was a Beijing official named Li Fuhou, who loved playing Weiqi. He hired a national master, surnamed Bao, as his teacher. A colleague named Xie Yiqun also had a strong interest in the game, and they became friends. They met every day and played Weiqi whenever they met. Xie's skills were superior to Li's, and Li often found himself in difficult situations. One day, Li lost again, and Xie became arrogant and spoke sarcastically. Li was angry, and Xie left. Li rearranged the pieces, trying to find a way to survive, but he couldn't. It was midnight, and he still hadn't gone to the inner chamber. A maid named A Juan was serving him. She said, "It's late. Why hasn't the master gone to bed yet? Madam is sitting by the lamp, waiting for the sound of your footsteps. Every moment feels like a year. How can you bear it?" Li angrily scolded her. A Juan said, "Does the master want to avenge the humiliation of the day? It's easy. Just move one piece on the fourth or sixth row three steps to the left, and you'll turn defeat into victory." Li followed her advice, and it worked. He was delighted and asked her to play a game with him. A Juan won decisively. Li said, "I didn't expect you to have such skills. Can you compete with Xie?" A Juan said, "I see Xie as taking something from a bag. Skill is not a concern." Li asked her who she learned from. A Juan said, "I never learned. Last year, I watched the master play with guests and guessed the outcomes correctly. This year, I notice flaws in every game." Li was even happier and embraced her, saying, "Fortunately, there's a female Zhuge Liang to help your father vent his anger." The next day, Xie came. Li said to him, "There's a little girl who can distinguish black and white and discuss tactics. Please teach her generously." Xie agreed. A Juan came out and took the white pieces, saying to Xie, "Let the master make the first move." Xie was displeased. After ten moves, he realized her moves were extraordinary and responded seriously. After dozens of moves, he was at a disadvantage and racked his brains, holding a piece for a long time without knowing where to place it. A Juan said to Xie, "Why are you so lost in thought? My feet are weak, and I can't stand for long." In the middle of the game, Xie's position became more precarious, and sweat poured down his face. A Juan said, "It's not hot today. Why are you sweating so much? Are you sick? Should you take medicine?" The game ended with Xie only having a small corner, about the size of a palm, with only a few dozen pieces alive. He was greatly ashamed and fled. A Juan then said to Li, "How was it? Playing with Xie doesn't require any thought. It's boring. But even the national master Bao is not to be feared." Another day, the national master came, and A Juan played a game with him, again taking the white pieces. The national master was surprised and didn't dare to be careless. After thirty moves, the national master said, "I'm no match for you. I concede. I've lost five pieces in this game." He wanted to leave quickly, but Li insisted on finishing the game. After checking the pieces, it was confirmed. A Juan said to Bao, "You only lost one piece in this game. But in one place, you underestimated me and didn't block, so you lost more." The national master was convinced. Later, Li took A Juan as a concubine, and his skills improved daily. Few could compete with him.</p>

<p>Record of the Flower Show in Suzhou – Wu Jiren</p>
<p>After the rambler rose blooms, the floral season wanes. The prosperity of Xipu lacks natural charm. A few days ago, I happened to return to Wu, and heard that there was a flower show in the Fifth of May Road Park. The organizer was my old friend, Mr. Fan Yunshu. Visiting flowers and old friends further stirred my interest. So, I went to see it with Fu Ji.</p>
<p>Entering the park gate, we first arrived at the East Study. Hundreds of potted flowers were on display. In the center, a small hill was piled up with colorful foreign flowers. The colors were coordinated and dazzling. Around the hall, potted flowers of various kinds were arranged. The jade-like blossoms and precious flowers swayed in the breeze. Flowers like the June Snow, Dendrobium loddigesii, and Chinese flowering crabapple, along with various azaleas, were splendid and radiant, displaying their beauty to the fullest extent. All were produced in this garden. The other varieties were too numerous to mention. Among them, we especially appreciated a type of fragrant narcissus, which we found particularly precious. There were four pots, all of the same color. The colors were like concubine river, goose yellow, water green, and moon white, possessing a charming beauty and emitting a rich, subtle fragrance that permeated the heart and soul. We lingered, reluctant to leave. Examining the labels, we found they belonged to the Yu family in Ge Baihu Lane, east of the city. Soon, we arrived at the West Pavilion. Dozens of species of Chinese juniper stumps were on display. At first glance, they looked like dead poplars sprouting buds, with a few twigs growing from rotten wood. Upon closer inspection, the intertwined roots and twisted trunks revealed a unique charm. Although shaped and pruned by human hands, they possessed an ancient and refined elegance, free from any trace of artificiality. The gnarled roots coiled like dragons, and the branches and leaves flourished, some towering like layered canopies, others soaring straight up like swirling snails, some like screens of cut rock, others like rounded spheres. The forms were novel and strange, full of vigor and vitality, lush and verdant, without any sign of decay or withering, conveying a sense of vigorous growth. I wondered how much effort the owner had put into cultivating them to achieve such a state. As far as my eyes could see, I offered some humble comments. I considered the pomegranate juniper of the Tianci Manor Li family to be the best, while the Podocarpus macrophyllus of the Qiaozhi Lane Zhang family, the Nandina domestica (Heavenly Bamboo) of the Yan Yamen Wang family (also known as Ten Merits), the Pinus thunbergii of the Ximei Lane Xu family, and the various small cacti were the highlights of the show. Afterwards, with plenty of leisure, I recorded these thoughts with my pen.</p>
<p>Interesting Stories from the Cocoon Studio – Yan Cun</p>
<p>My friend Cheng Xiaoqing, a writer of detective novels, enjoys a great reputation at home and abroad. However, he has not been producing much lately, leading many avid readers to write and inquire. There are many letters every day, and even some from far away, asking Mr. Cheng to solve their mysteries. This shows the power of his works. Yesterday, I visited his residence and had a half-day conversation. Mr. Cheng shared some recent interesting events, including the fact that after the film adaptation of his work "Shadow on the Window" by the Mingxing Film Company, he suddenly received a job offer from Guangdong. This was one incident. Another was that a reader from Shanghai asked if the investigations in "Shadow on the Window" were actually conducted by Xiaoqing himself. I then asked Xiaoqing about the structure of "Shadow on the Window." Xiaoqing said, "It's just a little trick. One night, I was returning home and saw a shadow in a building from afar. This made me think of my novels, and I wrote it down. It's very convoluted, but the source of the material can be triggered by a single event." I then asked Xiaoqing about his thoughts on detective films. Xiaoqing said, "The best ones use a convoluted plot as the warp and the detective steps as the weft. The next best only narrate the detective's abilities, neglecting the other characters in the drama. The worst ones only focus on fighting. Films like Ms. Bao Lian's long detective stories are really inferior. I recently watched 'The Rebirth of Sherlock Holmes,' which didn't fully capture the strengths of Holmes in the novel. I believe that detective films should not neglect the plot. They must be like peeling a banana or unraveling a cocoon to reveal the craftsmanship. Otherwise, they will be rough, confusing, and tasteless." I agree with Xiaoqing's words and believe that "Shadow on the Window" will set a new record for detective films. As evidenced by the facts, foreign detective films like "Everything Comes to Light" are rough compared to "Shadow on the Window."</p>
<p>The "After the Rain, Clear Sky" Premiere – Ni Gulian</p>
<p>At midnight on June 3rd, the Huaguang Sound Film Company, at the invitation of Mr. Luo Mingyou of the Lianhua Company, held a private premiere of its new sound film, "After the Rain, Clear Sky," which was filmed in Japan, at the Shanghai Grand Theater. I happened to be there and enjoyed it thoroughly from beginning to end. Because this film has not yet been publicly released, I don't need to provide a detailed review. Simply put, "After the Rain, Clear Sky" is a success. Whether it's the direction, script, acting, dialogue, singing, background, cinematography, or sound recording (the calligraphy in the dozens of explanatory subtitles is quite eye-straining and not to be praised), it's pure art. As the first sound film produced by a Chinese company, it surpasses foreign sound films that emphasize singing over plot, bringing glory to China. Although some say that "After the Rain, Clear Sky" was filmed in Japan and cannot be considered entirely "Huaguang," I disagree. Art knows no borders. Cinema originated in the West. Ask the Chinese film industry, besides directing, acting, cinematography, and set design, what equipment, such as cameras, film projectors, sound recorders, etc., is not foreign-made? Purchasing sound film equipment requires millions of capital. Who would dare to try it lightly? Now, Huaguang Company has used its wisdom and agility to first film a Movietone film in Japan, and it has succeeded. In the future, they will certainly officially purchase equipment and film domestically. Other companies will definitely follow suit and strive to produce truly domestic sound films. I pray that our entire Chinese film industry will regain its light and have a bright future. I have specifically written down my thoughts after watching "After the Rain, Clear Sky" to report to those who cherish Chinese cinema. Please everyone, rise up and support this promising Chinese cinema.</p>

<p>Travels around the Yellow Sea (28) – Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>"The fourth type of person strives for progress from their own position." This is what I have been telling young people for the past twenty years. Not working hard is not an option. Working hard without the right method is also not an option. Only by working hard can you find the right method. Everyone has their own position. When studying, studying is your foundation. Once you identify a field of study and master it to a certain degree, you should use what you have learned and serve. Whether it's directly for the country or indirectly for the country by serving society, within the scope of your responsibility, you should use a solid and persistent approach. First, seek internal refinement. Once you have sufficient strength, then seek external development while still adhering to the principle of using what you have learned. This is the most honorable, stable, and effective path for an individual to establish themselves. It is also the only way for the nation to save itself and become strong. The president of a Japanese university has held the position for over twenty or thirty years. A scholar at the Bikai Chicken Hatchery lectured us on how to construct chicken coops, how to mix feed, and how to incubate and raise chickens. He spoke for over an hour, tirelessly. Others may think the issue is too small. But his mindset seems to be that no cause is greater or more interesting than raising chickens. Thinking back, this is the true embodiment of their national spirit. Can Edison's contributions to the war effort in his laboratory be said to be smaller than that of soldiers in the trenches? Thinking this way, it is ridiculous to just wave flags and shout "Save the country!" or "Boycott foreign goods!" What China needs now is for millions of farmers, workers, businessmen, scholars, and soldiers to work diligently in their respective positions. If something happens, everyone will unite and resist foreign aggression. If we can do this, what is there to fear?</p>
<p>Alright, enough said. China has a long history. The so-called "ancient sages and worthies, eminent scholars and elders" have already spoken a lot about this. In recent years, people have spoken even more thoroughly and extensively. Not only have they spoken about it, but they have also written it on paper, pasted it on walls, and posted it on electric poles. It can be said to be "dazzling and overwhelming." The question now is for everyone to quickly take action and do it. Quickly take action and do it.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to introduce a very valuable statement. A Mr. Xia, who was on the same boat on the way back, said that the three things Chinese people should pay attention to in the future are: (1) unification; (2) production; and (3) national defense. We believe this is a very insightful statement.</p>
<p>The Three Eras of the Fiction Rotary Club (3) – Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>At this time, Zhang Xiaosan'er was cursing the patrol officer. The empty rickshaw puller felt that he was standing on the same front line, so he said: "Otherwise, how could people have composed a song about it? 'The little patrolman in green, fears nothing but the big soldiers. When he sees a foreign car, he gets angry. When he sees a car, he stands at attention.'" Zhang Xiaosan'er said, "In these unreasonable times, one day you'll fall into my hands..."</p>
<p>"Clack!"</p>
<p>The back of the rickshaw canopy was hit with a truncheon. The police officer grabbed the rickshaw with one hand and raised the truncheon with the other, hitting Zhang Xiaosan'er's spine. Zhang Xiaosan'er leaned aside, glared at the police officer and said, "Why are you hitting people?" The police officer hit him again and cursed, "You bunch of bastards, you don't understand when I speak nicely. The only thing you understand is getting beat." In the meantime, a crowd had already gathered on the street. The police officer grabbed the rickshaw and said, "Let's go to the police station." Zhang Xiaosan'er held onto the rickshaw handle and wouldn't let go. He twisted his neck and said, "Why go to the police station? Is the world yours? You hit someone and still want them to go to the police station? Even if I offended the police officer, it probably doesn't warrant getting shot. Your mother..."</p>
<p>"Clack!"</p>
<p>The police officer didn't use the truncheon. He slapped Zhang Xiaosan'er's face with his left hand and pointed with the truncheon with his right, saying, "You dare to curse my parents. I'll beat you to death." Zhang Xiaosan'er also realized that he was in the wrong. Half of his yellow face turned purple. He couldn't say anything. Among the onlookers, there were those who liked to meddle. They stepped forward and said, "Come on, sir. He's just a rickshaw puller. Don't bother with him." The police officer said, "I don't want to make things difficult for him. He was singing nonsense on the street. I told him nicely not to sing, but he started cursing me. He cursed my parents. You all heard it." The onlookers saw that someone had already come forward to mediate. Everyone started chiming in and trying to resolve the situation. So the police officer let go, tapped the rickshaw handle with his truncheon, and shouted, "Get out of here!" Zhang Xiaosan'er dragged the rickshaw out of the crowd. He was still cursing in his mouth: "Damn bad luck. I got hassled by this mushroom for a while." He was saying this, but he wasn't walking slowly like before. He was running fast. He ran a long way. The farther he got, the more he cursed. He waited until he had a customer before he put the matter aside for the sake of business.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<p>Gold Prices Suddenly Drop</p>
<p>The gold price turned slightly downward again yesterday, with fluctuations of up to eight taels from morning to night, resulting in a net decrease of seven taels. Sentiment was uneasy but there were no major changes. The silver market was slightly lower with more selling interest, and the European market was normal, so prices fell from the start. Later, although exchange rates narrowed by half a point, domestic prices eased instead. Various firms sold more than they bought, causing the market price to break through 810 taels, making the market feel even weaker. There were slight fluctuations of two or three taels, but sellers were still abundant, mostly due to a shortage of drafts. The silver market is expected to rise again, estimated at 807 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>After the opening, sentiment reversed, with an initial drop of 1.6 qian to 813 taels. Large bars fell by one-eighth, and silver prices by one-quarter. However, private telegrams only indicated a decrease of one-eighth, so sentiment reversed. Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, Hongli and others all sold, dropping from 13.2 qian to 10 qian. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of two qian. On the trading floor, Yuanmaoyong, Wanxing, Zhifengyong, and Shunli bought in. Dadecheng, Chunyuanyong, and Tongtaichang sold again. Drafts were stable, with British gold initially settling at 125, followed by 625 to 125 matched trades. When the announcement of a shilling increase to 12 taels was made, it was due to a rate reduction of 125, US dollars 25, and Japanese gold plus 1.5 fen. Soon after, British gold was sold by the bank at 125, and Dadecheng, Hengyu, Tianyuyong, Yuanxingyong, Chengfengyong, and others all sold off, resulting in a depreciation of 4 taels, with fluctuations of one tael. At 10:00, it was 07 taels and 8 qian. At this time, China Bank had taken in recent-term British gold at 125, and US dollars had settled at 28.6875 yuan. The bank then traded amongst themselves at 6875. As for the buyers on the floor, Yuan Cheng, Longsheng, Chengfengyong, Yuan Chengyong, Yuanheng, and others came in. At 10:45, it was 12.2 qian. As Chunyuanyong and Yuanheng sold off, it fell by another three or four taels. At 11:00, it was 8.4 qian. Shortly after, Yifengyong, Tianfengyong, and Yuanxingyong came in, reaching 11.8 qian at 11:30. British gold settled at 0625 to 125. Short-term British gold was bought by Huabi at 125, followed by a downturn of more than 3 taels. Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, and Yongfeng sold off, reaching 08.5 taels at noon. Near the close, it was 09.3 qian, with Tianyuyong selling on behalf of a speculator, pushing it down to within 8 taels.

Zero-lot buyers chased after it, increasing it by 1 qian to 7.4 qian. After 2:45, Yongfeng and others sold off goods for hedging, and with August British gold settling at 1875, the market suddenly faltered, falling by 2 taels, finally reaching 05.2 qian at 3:30.

<p>Exchange Rates Strong Externally but Weak Internally</p>
<p>Yesterday, British and American silver markets reported slight declines, causing HSBC rates to narrow by half a point, with British gold at 125, at one shilling, one penny, and eight hundred seventy-five thousandths. The US dollar was 25, calculated at 28.125 yuan. Japanese gold added one and a half points, calculated at one tael, seven qian, and five and a half fen. Other exchange rates were also tighter. However, the actual transaction price of the bank was initially flat, then strong, and then loose in the afternoon. The gold price suddenly turned downward, with large increases and small retracements. Near the close, compared to the previous afternoon, British gold increased by 0625, US dollars increased by 125, and Japanese gold decreased by half a fen, truly reflecting an external tightening and internal loosening. Trading by Chinese merchants was not quiet, but there were no large sums. Shillings were slightly reduced from the previous market, with slightly reduced selling by the back market. Banks such as HSBC, Sumitomo, and Great Britain bought in, with a total of about 300,000 pounds traded throughout the day. The hedge left the gold price at 13-14 taels. There were also many transactions between the US dollar banks, about 300,000 yuan. Meifeng was a seller, Mitsui had a good appetite, but there were only a few Japanese gold transactions. Sales by the Dalian group suggest that the Bombay exchange rate has risen and large bars may be rising.</p>

<p>The Grand Finale of the Second Du Shrine Dedication Ceremony was No Less Impressive Than the Previous Two Days</p>
<p>The Grand Finale: Yesterday was the last day of the Second Du Shrine dedication ceremony. Besides prominent figures from the military and political circles, such as He Yingqin's representative, He Jiwu; Gao Jiyi's representative; and the Panchen Lama's special representative, many notable figures from the banking and financial sector also attended, including Qian Xinzhi, Wu Yunzhai, Hu Bijang, Song Ziliang, Lin Kanghou, Qin Runqing, as well as prominent businessmen like Pan Jiarui and female guest Zheng Yuxiu. The crowd was still around ten thousand. The most famous navy band in the country came to the venue to play music, and the scene was no less impressive than the previous two days.</p>
<p>Continued Congratulatory Telegrams from Various Parties: "Zhang Yuejun": I am deeply regretful for not being able to personally attend the dedication ceremony of the Hua Ancestral Temple. I have entrusted Secretary Guo to go and offer congratulations on my behalf. (Omitted below) "Zeng Yujun": I am disappointed that I could not participate in the dedication of the ancestral temple. I have specially entrusted my brother, Qiu Fuyu, to attend the ceremony and express my sincere feelings. "Miao Bin": The completion of the Second Du Shrine has resonated both domestically and internationally. I originally planned to come and offer my congratulations in person, but due to important matters, I was unable to do so. I have entrusted Wang Youlong to offer congratulations on my behalf. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Conclusion of the Organizing Office: The grandeur of this ceremony was truly rare. On the military music front, all the finest elements from across the country participated. On the military and police front, the army, navy, land and water police, northern and southern defense groups, anti-smuggling units, detective teams, fire brigades, and Red Cross Society all arrived to maintain order. More than a thousand tables of banquets were set up each day, yet many were still unable to find a seat. Most regrettably, there were not enough vehicles to go around, causing guests to walk back and forth. Even distinguished guests and their families experienced this. Due to the large number of people, hospitality was inevitably inadequate. The host expressed deep apologies after learning of this. The organizing office is now being supervised by Yu Qiaqing for closure, and most of the staff will return to Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>Prostitute in a Brothel Uses Rigged Dice to Swindle Gambler, Zhang Baode Loses His Life: After Detection, He is Beaten and Falsely Accused of Robbery; Dies in Custody the Same Night; His Wife Files a Lawsuit Seeking Justice</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 4th this year, in the room of prostitute Hua Feihong (also known as Ma Laoer) at the Guangxi Road number 488 brothel, a gambling session was in progress. Zhang Baode (also known as Zhang Bingsheng), who made a living by polishing rust, was forcibly invited into the game by a dozen people who were both customers and gamblers, including Zhou Zixiang, Chen Zhice, Chen Ziliang, Li Peisheng, Zhou Rongchu, Tang Wenming, Zhou Benren, Zhou Bin, Wu Yongxing, Wang Haishan, Li Xing, Chen Zizhu, and Zhang Wenji. They gambled and drank, surrounded by luxury. Suddenly, Zhang Baode noticed that the dice being thrown were rigged. He firmly held them in his hand and argued with them. However, Zhou Zixiang and Hua Feihong were all in the same gang. Seeing that their scheme had been exposed, they ganged up and beat Zhang Baode, locking him in a room. They then falsely accused Zhang of robbery to the Zhabei police station. The police chief sent detectives to arrest Zhang and take him to the police station for detention, while also launching an investigation. Unexpectedly, Zhang died in custody that night. His wife, Ms. Lü, prepared a coffin and arranged the funeral, determined to seek justice. She has now hired lawyer Fan Gang to file a criminal lawsuit with the Special District Local Court against Hua Feihong and the other gamblers, accusing them of conspiring to defraud, unlawfully imprison, and cause death by injury. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu presided over the hearing. Only Hua Feihong and her lawyer, Chen Tingshui, appeared in court. The others' addresses were unknown, and they could not be summoned. Judge Wu conducted a brief interrogation and ordered a postponement, instructing the plaintiff to ascertain the addresses of the remaining defendants and summon them again.</p>
<p>House Confiscated for Harboring Bandits Returned After Appeal: The House is Property of Fu Kang Bank; Initial Confiscation Reasoning Not Sufficient</p>
<p>Cai Fulin, a comprador for the British American Tobacco Company, was kidnapped by bandits last winter. The police later apprehended the bandits and handed them over to the Special District Local Court, which found them guilty and sentenced them. The court also confiscated the house at 401 Wuding Road in the western part of Shanghai, as the landlord had rented it to the bandits for use as a base of operations. The house is owned by Fu Kang Bank and managed by Youcheng Real Estate Company. Since its confiscation, the bank has been unwilling to accept the decision and proposed a solution at a meeting of the Shanghai Real Estate Association. It was agreed that since the court's decision was deemed unfair, legal channels should be pursued to seek redress. Therefore, Fu Kang Bank hired lawyers Zhang Deqin and Shen Yuesheng to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The appeal detailed the house's rental history and the reasons why it should not have been confiscated, arguing that in August of last year, the manager reported that a man claiming to be Zhang Mingzhi had come to rent the house. As usual, they asked him to sign a lease and provide a guarantor. He found the Fu Chang mirror shop at 1196 Carter Road as guarantor and moved in. Less than two months later, at the end of September, he terminated the lease and moved out. The house and rent were handed over, and there were no disputes. The rent collector returned the rental guarantee to the guarantor, never anticipating such a significant incident and innocent involvement, even to the point of confiscation of the house. Article 5 of the regulations on punishing kidnappers stipulates that the house should only be confiscated based on the following facts: (1) The bandit organization was discovered in the house, (2) The guarantor cannot be identified. In this case, the bandits were not discovered in the house, and the guarantor was identified as the Fu Chang mirror shop. Therefore, it is a misapplication of the law and an unwarranted implication. If confiscation were deemed legal, then any hotel or place where bandits had once set foot would also be implicated and confiscated. The original sentence was inappropriate and should be revoked, and the house should be returned. Judge Song convened a hearing with the jury. Many owners were present in the courtroom. Lawyer Zhang presented the reasons for the appeal. The judge then questioned the owner of the Fu Chang mirror shop about the circumstances of guaranteeing the rental of the house at that time. Subsequently, the police lawyer and Lawyer Zhang debated the issue. Yesterday afternoon, the court delivered its verdict, stating: The original judgment regarding the confiscation of the house at 401 Wuding Road is revoked. The house at 401 Wuding Road, owned by Fu Kang Bank, shall be returned.</p>
<p>Disabled Soldier Defrauded of Money for Artificial Limb: Zhang Deting Convicted of Fraud and Sentenced to Ten Months in Prison</p>
<p>Zeng Youcheng, deputy battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 162nd Brigade of the 54th Division of the Army, was wounded in his left arm while commanding operations in the war zone last year. The arm was subsequently amputated by a doctor, resulting in a disability. Not only could he not work, but his appearance was also unsightly. He was eager to get an artificial limb. In March of this year, he met Zhang Deting, a native of Shaoxing, in the capital. He learned that Zhang was an employee of the Tiangong Foreign Firm on Peng Road in Shanghai, and that his boss, a Russian named Kao Tuosi, was an expert in fitting wooden limbs. He discussed getting an artificial limb with Zhang, and they agreed on a price of 400 yuan, with half paid in advance. Together, they came to Shanghai and met with Kao, with Xu Chutang from Ningbo acting as translator. They agreed on a date for the fitting of the limb, and Zeng returned to the capital. On April 30th, Zhang Deting went to Nanjing again and collected the remaining 200 yuan from Zeng, saying that the artificial limb would arrive soon. He gave Zeng a receipt. Since then, there was no news. Recently, Zeng came to Shanghai and questioned the Russian, showing him the receipts given by Zhang. Kao said that he had never received any money and that the receipts were forged by Zhang. Zeng reported the matter to the Hongkou police station, which sent detectives to apprehend Zhang and Xu. Zhang admitted that he had used the 400 yuan for his own purposes. The police filed a fraud charge. After investigation by the Special District Local Court, Judge Feng sentenced Zhang Deting to ten months in prison and ordered him to repay Zeng Youcheng 400 yuan. Xu Chuchang was found not guilty. Zhang was not satisfied and hired lawyer Fan Gang to appeal. Judge Feng approved the appeal.</p>
<p>Brothers Quarrel, Disregarding Sibling Bonds, Attack Each Other with Weapons</p>
<p>In Niuqiao Village, Yin Xing District, the landlords Shen Linsheng and Shen Fusheng are brothers and farmers. Although they live together, they are not on good terms due to the instigation of their wives, and they often quarrel. At around 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, Fusheng's eight-year-old son, named Alan, went to Linsheng's woodpile to take a few stalks of wheat. Linsheng's wife, Yan, saw him and stopped him. The child, unaware of the situation, started crying. Fusheng's wife, Cai, rushed over, dragged her son Alan back, and scolded Yan. The two women then started a verbal argument, insulting each other. Fusheng heard the commotion and became furious. He ran to the kitchen, grabbed a cleaver, and went to Linsheng's place to cause trouble. Linsheng saw his brother about to attack him and refused to back down. He picked up a grass-cutting knife and slashed at Fusheng. Fusheng used the cleaver to parry. Blood and blades flashed, and the two brothers engaged in a vicious fight. Police officers arrived to stop the fight. Both were injured. Fusheng had a head wound, and Linsheng was stabbed several times in the legs and arms. The police took the brothers and weapons to the first station of the seventh district. After a brief interrogation by Chief Zhang, they were ordered to be sent to the local court yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Carriage Owners Advised to Instruct Drivers to Strictly Adhere to Regulations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Motor Vehicle Department issued a circular yesterday stating that privately owned carriages often fail to comply with traffic regulations, especially in busy downtown areas. They sometimes cut in front of other vehicles, drive two abreast, or ignore traffic lights and police signals. These violations could impede other vehicles and cause danger. The Council urges carriage owners to pay attention for their own safety and the convenience of the public. Carriage owners must strictly instruct drivers to comply with traffic regulations. If such incidents occur again, the Motor Vehicle Department has instructed the police to record the carriage number and issue a summons to the court, just as with automobiles. The Council hopes that carriage owners and passengers will remind drivers to avoid traffic violations. The Municipal Council also hopes to reduce the number of lawsuits.</p>
<p>Lawsuit for Compensation in Fishmonger's Death Case: Da Lai Manager Absent, Hearing Postponed</p>
<p>Fishmonger Zhang Zhiting transported fish from Puxi to Pudong daily, supporting his family with his meager income. On the morning of December 11th last year, the He Zhou was sailing in the Huangpu River off Jinliyuan when a small ship from the Da Lai Steamship Company sped north without sounding its horn. It was impossible to avoid a collision. The fish boat capsized. The boatman Zhou Yunlong and fishmongers Zhang Zhiting and Feng Dongsheng all fell into the river. Neighboring boats and the water police rescued two of them. Zhou was unharmed, but Zhang was injured. He was sent to Tongren Hospital, where he died the next day due to his injuries. The case was investigated by the local court, which brought public charges and sentenced Chen Laowu, the captain of the Da Lai ship, to four weeks in jail and a fine of 320 yuan. Zhang's wife, Tao, has had difficulty making ends meet since losing her husband. She recently hired lawyer Li Aokui to file a lawsuit with the local court seeking assistance. The lawsuit states that Zhang Zhiting and Feng Dongsheng sold fish in Pudong every morning, transporting fish from Puxi, and that Zhang's family depended on this for their livelihood. On the morning of December 11th, Zhang and Feng were crossing the river when the Da Lai Company's Dollar ship sped north without any warning, causing a collision. Zhang was seriously injured and died despite being taken to the hospital. The defendant was found guilty in court. Zhang's death has left his family without support. They have repeatedly requested compensation from the Da Lai Company but have received no response. The lawsuit requests the court to order the Da Lai Company to pay 60 yuan for the loss of goods and 5,000 yuan in compensation. At the initial hearing, the defendant was absent. At yesterday's repeat hearing, the Da Lai manager was absent. The defendant Chen Laowu stated that he was unable to pay the large sum and that the plaintiff should seek compensation from the Da Lai Company. The plaintiff stated that the boatman Zhou Yunlong had already received 150 yuan for the boat, and Feng Dongsheng had received 30 yuan for his goods. The plaintiff is destitute and the compensation must be paid in full by the two defendants. The hearing was postponed due to the absence of the Da Lai manager.</p>
<p>Zheng Ruigen Commits Suicide by Drowning</p>
<p>Zheng Ruigen, a 25-year-old employee of the Yuli Pharmacy in the Nanshi district, and a native of Cixi, Zhejiang, had worked at the pharmacy for a long time. On the 27th of the previous month, Zheng requested leave to return to Cixi. At around 4:30 PM that day, he took a car to the Taikoo Wharf and boarded the New Beijing steamship. Unexpectedly, after Zheng departed, many days passed without him arriving home or returning to work, causing suspicion. The pharmacy sent someone to inquire on the New Beijing ship and learned that Zheng had boarded the ship that day. That night, as the ship sailed out of Songkou, Zheng suddenly had suicidal thoughts for some reason, walked out of the cabin, and jumped off the deck into the sea while no one was watching. Passengers and staff on the ship discovered this, but it was already dark, making rescue impossible. The body quickly drifted away. Zheng was wearing a short shirt and a gold ring on his left finger, engraved with the words "De Li". The pharmacy notified his family and reported the incident to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau in Wusong, which forwarded it to the Wusongkou Lifesaving Bureau, requesting assistance in recovering the body.</p>

<p>Dispute Over the Hiring of Temporary Workers at the British American Tobacco Factory: Failure to Follow Factory Practices Leads to Unsuccessful Union Negotiations</p>
<p>The various sections of the British American Tobacco factory in Pudong have been adding workers and hiring temporary workers, which was previously handled by the section supervisors and foremen. Recently, the factory has been independently hiring temporary workers, causing dissatisfaction among the workers. They believe that the newly hired temporary workers are informants for the factory. The first representative meeting of the Pudong Cigarette Industry Union requested the factory to abolish this new method. The union sent representatives to negotiate with the factory, and the factory agreed to provide more permanent worker badges and stop hiring temporary workers. However, yesterday, seven temporary workers in the tin packaging section of the old factory were promoted to permanent workers. The workers in that section were dissatisfied and reported the matter to the union for negotiation. The union sent Liu Dehua, Xiao Changgeng, and Fei Keguang, along with a translator, to negotiate with the factory. During the negotiations, a Westerner named Lobs hit worker number 182, causing public outrage. Another Westerner named Siderworth brandished a pistol to threaten the workers. The workers were terrified, and the order was disrupted. The representatives of the section, fearing trouble, advised the workers to wait for a resolution. The workers left the factory peacefully, and the negotiations were suspended. The union immediately convened a meeting of all workers and decided to demand that the factory follow the labor-management mutual aid regulations and continue to follow factory practices when adding permanent workers. They also demanded that the factory severely punish the Westerner who threatened the workers with a gun. After the meeting, the union sent representatives Chen Peide, Gu Ruofeng, and Liu Dehua to the factory for a second round of negotiations. However, the factory refused to compromise. The union, fearing the expansion of the unrest, immediately submitted a report to the city's Party headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for instructions. It is rumored that the male and female workers in that section will continue to strike today, awaiting mediation.</p>

The ship then notified the family of the deceased and sailed back to Shanghai, arriving yesterday. The deceased's maternal uncle, Sun Hengming, went to Zhang Defu's home (located in Gaoxiangtou, inside the Dadongmen) to inquire why the coffin had not been brought to Shanghai. Zhang replied that it was currently hot weather and they were concerned about the spread of disease, so it would be brought back in the winter. The two parties disagreed and took the matter to the police station in the first district, who referred it to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for handling.</p>

He became suspicious and questioned his wife, Zhang, but she was evasive. He secretly inquired with his neighbors and learned that after he was detained, Zhang had left alone and had not been seen returning home. Liu was even more furious and questioned Zhang further. Zhang then claimed that she had been staying at the home of Chen Liu, a fellow villager, at Number 38 Qinglong Bridge. Liu did not believe her and forced her to go to Chen Liu's place to confront her and reveal the truth. Chen Liu, seeing that Liu had brought his wife with him, knew that something was amiss and used a trick to lure Liu away. She whispered to Liu, saying that she had two secret words to tell him and asked him to come upstairs to talk. Liu believed her and went upstairs with Liu. However, Zhang remained downstairs. After the two went upstairs, Liu whispered to Liu, "Your wife has indeed been staying at my place for several nights, but there is nothing else." She then asked him to go downstairs. Liu was suspicious of her strange behavior and quickly went downstairs to check on his wife, but she had already disappeared. He chased after her but could not find her.

<p>Special Item: The Call of the Overseas Chinese in Mexicali</p>
<p>The Cali Chinese Association in Mexicali published a call for help for unemployed and starving overseas Chinese, stating in the first paragraph that our overseas Chinese are under the economic oppression of foreigners. Our great rights have been lost, causing national economy and people's livelihood to be in great difficulty. Overseas Chinese have climbed mountains and sailed the seas, leaving their footprints all over the world to seek a living. They are steadfast, hardworking, thrifty, and hard-working. The statement continues that twenty years ago, the land was all wilderness, with few inhabitants. The overseas Chinese cleared the land and cultivated the fields, creating today's fertile and prosperous situation. This was all made from the sweat and blood of the overseas Chinese. How could there be such a new atmosphere without them? However, the Mexicans have various oppressive regulations. The most intense anti-Chinese sentiment is in the city of Mexicali. The cruelest anti-Chinese oppressive regulation is in Mexicali. Mexicali is mainly agricultural, and agriculture is mainly invested by Americans. Although the Mexicans know that the various industries of the overseas Chinese are struggling to survive, they show no pity. They force Chinese businessmen to increase the number of Mexican workers they hire; otherwise, they will seal the shops, detain people, and demand money. The labor party creates disturbances first, and the government encourages them later. The oppression is increasing daily and is unbearable</p>

<p>Brave Villager Dies Resisting Bandits. Houqibu, in the eastern part of Xiangshan County, is located by the sea and is often troubled by bandits. The other day, more than forty sea bandits suddenly arrived and landed in the village from Pingyantou, intending to plunder. Fortunately, Zheng Achun, a resident of the area, learned of the situation in advance and, together with many village strongmen, including Zheng Alai, took up arms and engaged the bandits. After several hours of fierce fighting, the bandits, unable to withstand the force, dispersed and fled. However, Alai was shot and killed by the bandits due to his bravery in resisting them.</p>

<p>Joint Suppression of Bandits at Sanjue Temple. The area bordering Shouxian, Hefei, and Lu'an counties in northern Anhui has always been a hotbed of banditry. Despite repeated military campaigns, the bandits have not been completely eradicated. Recently, bandit activity has resurfaced in the vicinity of Sanjue Temple, with the bandit gang led by Zhang Zibin rampaging and causing great harm. Zhang Xiangkun, the county magistrate of Shouxian, and Quan Liting, the captain of the Fourth Brigade of the Lu'an Security Corps, each led their troops in a fierce pincer movement at the beginning of this month. The bandits, unable to resist, fled southeast. Subsequently, they were intercepted by the Security Corps stationed at Zaoshudian and fled into Hefei County. Upon receiving a report, the 270th Regiment of the 46th Division stationed in Hefei, led by Regiment Commander Hu, immediately led their troops to engage them head-on. Over a hundred bandits were killed at the time, greatly weakening the bandit force. Zhang Xiangkun then led his troops to encircle and suppress the bandits in the direction of Maji, while Quan Liting led his troops to advance on Wangji and Moziawan. The bandit gang has been surrounded and should be annihilated soon.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Should "Bird and Animal Language" Readings Be Abolished? ㈡ Chen Heqin <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>(B) I also saw a comical short film last week that could serve as a reference for us. This film is called "Animal Concert". Before the concert, many animals dressed in clothes, wearing glasses, and riding various means of transportation, came to attend this grand concert. Some rode in airships, "zhā: zhā::" flying down from the sky, some rode in cars, "wū: wū::" driving down from the bridge, some rode in trains, "gōng: gōng::" rushing from afar, and some rode in carriages, "dé: dé::" running from the street. All kinds of sights were very lively.</p>
<p>The program was quite interesting when the concert started. Suddenly, three or four frog girls, holding hands, opened their mouths, danced and sang. Suddenly, five or six mouse ladies, cocking their tails, raised their heads and sang with great enthusiasm, singing very well. Suddenly, a white cat gentleman, hanging his body, dangling his tail, played the piano with both hands, his eyes sometimes big and sometimes small, full of spirit. At that time, yellow dogs, roosters, crows... some played copper drums, some played xylophones... shouting and jumping, each offering their own talent. Sometimes it was like this, sometimes like that, for about ten minutes. After this film was shown, the whole audience applauded spontaneously. This kind of "Animal Concert" is purely a story in bird and animal language, and this kind of story is not only popular with children, but also very welcome to adults.</p>
<p>(5) In fact, readings in bird and animal language are very popular in Europe and America. I don't know what bad influence those European and American children have received from reading and listening to these readings. I will now talk about my own experience. My children can be said to like readings in bird and animal language very much. Not only ordinary readings in bird and animal language, but also very supernatural materials, such as Journey to the West, Erlang God capturing Sun Wukong, Investiture of the Gods, etc., are very much liked to listen to and watch.</p>
<p>Sometimes after I read it or they watched it themselves, I would ask them, "Is this true? Is there really a Sun Wukong? Can he really somersault 108,000 miles?" They all replied, "No, it's not possible." Sometimes they even replied, "This is a story, just telling it." I asked them again, "Since these stories are fake, why do you still like to listen to them?" They replied, "It's fun."</p>
<p>From this point of view, these recreational readings for children really do not have much hindrance to young children.</p>
<p>In conclusion, children, especially those under the age of seven or eight, like to listen to, watch, and perform readings in bird and animal language. How much harm does this kind of reading really do? It can be said to be very, very little. When they watch it, they only think it's fun and don't really believe it.</p>
<p>As for this kind of reading in bird and animal language, it is often told to children or shown to children, which of course has a kind of danger. This danger is the same as what children usually need, like "breastfeeding".</p>
<p>We all know that milk is a very good nutrient, and children cannot survive without it. However, if he is still breastfeeding after the age of one and a half, and does not eat anything else, then although he will not be in any danger, he will suffer losses. We should slowly give him some other things to eat. Readings in bird and animal language are somewhat similar to breastfeeding. Young children like to listen to stories in bird and animal language very much. I am afraid that at that time, we can only tell them those stories and write those readings for them, just like children under one year old can only be fed milk. When they grow up, they should eat less milk, and they should tell and watch less readings in bird and animal language, and show them more other readings. But we must never say that milk is a bad thing and cannot be given to him to eat.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to solemnly declare that readings in bird and animal language have their own considerable position and value. We adults have no right to deprive children of what they need, just like we deprive children of the right to breastfeed.</p>
<p>However, when children grow up, we should provide them with other materials to read, just like giving them other nutrients to eat after they have eaten milk.</p>
<p>Now, in our country, adult children's readings are still those kinds of bird and animal language and various supernatural stories, just like adult children still have to eat milk all day long. How can children be strong? We should try our best to compile various scientific stories to enrich his experience and arouse his interest.</p>
<p>I want to add that the various supernatural novels and martial arts novels that are currently published in bookstores are really not in line with children's psychology, and also contain a kind of misleading meaning. They even sell ridiculous and absurd readings that cause terror, such as various rabbit stories, etc. It is best not to show these stories to children. (End)</p>

<p>Cheng Tianfang, the Director of the Anhui Department of Education, has served for more than two years and has an outstanding reputation. He left Anhui with his family in February of this year and firmly resigned to the central government. Various parties tried to persuade him to stay, but to no avail. The central government once announced Li Zhonggong, but he also firmly declined. For several months, the department's affairs have been handled by Secretary Li Zhongxiang, who, in addition to maintaining the status quo, has tried his best to increase the budget and handle the review and examination matters. Recently, the provincial government publicly recommended Provincial Committee Member Yi Enbo to concurrently serve as Director of the Department of Education. Yi took office on the morning of June 8th at 11:00 AM. After the handover was completed, the original Secretary Li Zhongxiang, Section Chief Chen Yingkun, Chen Xifang, and others all resigned. Yi tried to persuade them to stay, but to no avail. He then convened a meeting of department staff in the auditorium, saying that Director Cheng's past achievements were very good, and although he had been in education (Yi had served as Acting Director of Education in Shandong), it had been many years and he no longer had much interest. This time, the provincial government strongly recommended him, so he had to temporarily serve concurrently. He hoped that all department staff would continue to work diligently as in the past, except for those who had firmly resigned.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Shaanxi Female Athlete Sets National Shot Put Record <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shaanxi Provincial Capital Middle and Primary School Joint Sports Meet was held from May 29th to 21st for three days of track and field events. It was found that the women's shot put result in this sports meet broke the national record. The athlete was Ms. Yu Zhen of the First Women's Normal School, who set a new record of 8.35 meters for throwing an eight-pound shot put, which is 51 cm more than the record of 7.84 meters set by Ms. He Zhenkun of Liaoning in the women's shot put at last year's National Games.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Ma Ling Challenges China <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Proposes Track and Field Confrontation After Being Unwilling to Accept Defeat</p>
<p>Decision on Whether to Hold It Will Be Made in the Next Few Days</p>
<p>Shang Weikai, the sports instructor of the US Marine Corps, wrote to Shen Siliang, the honorary chief of the All-China Athletic Association, proposing a track and field confrontation between Ma Ling and China. Before the International Games, Ma Ling and Jiangnan held a confrontation once, and Ma Ling won with 74 to 70. In the International Games, the United States lost with 104 points to 150 points. Most of the American team's organization was composed of Ma City athletes, and most of the Chinese team members were also from Jiangnan. Therefore, Ma Ling is unwilling to accept defeat and has the ambition to compete again. According to Shen Siliang, this move is very interesting, but most of the Chinese team members are students and are busy preparing for the big exam, which may be difficult. He will try his best to make it happen, and a decision on whether to hold it will be made in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Postponement of This Year's Shanghai Middle School Sports Federation Games <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>It has been decided to hold it in the next semester</p>
<p>The 3rd Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation Games were originally scheduled to be held at the China Athletics Field today and tomorrow. Now, because the weather is hot and the schools are all busy preparing for the big exam, the committee has decided to postpone it and reschedule it for the next semester.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Recent News from the Municipal Stadium Tennis Club <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The report on the third amateur tennis competition at the Municipal Stadium has been closed for a long time, and the start date is not far away. It is learned that the field will convert the southern half of the soccer field into six tennis courts during the tennis season to facilitate public training. Its original three tennis courts will be used for tennis competition and member practice to avoid mixing and to observe the level of the members. The levels can be observed to ensure fairness when they are assigned to groups in the future. It is also said that a small number of members of the association have not yet completed the registration procedures and must complete them before the 20th of this month, otherwise they will be invalid.</p>
