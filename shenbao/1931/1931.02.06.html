<p>時評</p>
<h3>法著作家之對德主張</h3>
<p>世人每謂法意間之意見。日漸睽隔。足爲世界和平前途之隱憂。然除法意之外。法德兩國間之意見。不能接近亦頗足爲和平前途之梗。近年來德國。政界與議會中之要人。盛倡修改楊格計劃减輕賠欵之論。而法國輿論之所表示。</p>
<p>每含有反對之意。故世人咸認此事。爲將來法德間之一大爭點。今乃忽得一足以解釋兩方意見之消息。即法國享有盛名之著作家地歐米桑氏。所發表論文之主張是也。該氏主張。法國照楊格計劃。將對德債權之數。自動减去其半。一方與德國訂立一軍約。將兩國軍費詳加限制。他國如願意。亦可與法同樣訂約。法前總理哈里亞脫氏。亦極端贊成其說。竊謂此項主張。如果實現。則非特法德間之誤會。可以盡釋。且因此軍費上之合作。并可消去軍縮會議之一大阻力。和平前途。不難由此生一新希望。此誠可喜之消息也。巴黎電又謂。法報對於法德銀行界協同承受德聯邦鐵路担保之短期公債。咸表歡迎。謂此舉可以鼓勵法銀行貸欵德商。並爲法國貸欵德國之先聲。此雖細故。將來即可由此而入於經濟上之合作。是亦足爲法德間意見。漸相接近之一徵也。</p>

<h3>日清金山丸輪在汕頭外觸礁失事</h3>
<p>▲船身全破無法救出</p>
<p>▲船員買辦明日可來</p>
<p>日清公司金山丸、今次連雜糧往南華、在汕頭港外觸礁、船已套進礁石、將不能救援、連同貨物損失、至少在二十餘萬元、此事情形、經記者分赴各方面、查報如後、</p>
<p>▲觸礁情形　金山丸裝得滿船黄荳、開赴汕厦廣州交卸、在本月二號夜中九時四十分、船到汕頭港外、約距九十海浬之海面、其時已下霧露、金山丸船主、擬當夜趕開到汕頭後、三號即可卸貨、使船期不致有誤、且以此路爲其久行之航綫、料無意外、故仍於霧中前進、不意航道之方向、已爲霧蔽、而時船身開到暗礁之上、九時四十五分、該輪砰然一聲、即觸入暗礁、而船底即套進礁石之上、</p>
<p>▲各艙浸水　金山丸輪首艙底、被礁石洞破、海水猛進、霎時間、貨艙内水進三尺、十分鐘後、二艙亦相繼浸水、量後機器間内亦有海水冲入、全船電燈、亦皆息滅、船上船員水手等大起恐慌、均準備救命衣　板船等逃生、幸船底爲礁石擱住、未即沉没、但水已滿上台甲矣、</p>
<p>▲輪艦救護　船主在失事後、急發無綫電求救信號ＳＯＳ、並放火翦乞援、首先得到此信號者、爲在福州馬公之日本驅逐艦竹號、立即啓椗冒霧至汕頭外海援救、迨到該處、亦未敢駛近、用無綫電通話、一面由竹號艦、轉電汕頭日清分社、命速運食糧等到來協助、竹號艦則在外擋任保護之責、以防海盜行刦、而日清汕頭分社得報、適滬粤班輪嵩山丸回航至汕、急命裝運大批糧食淡水救護上應用材料、立即開赴海面、至金山丸失事處、嵩山放小汽船與舢舨船等、將食料等送上金山、以供各船員水手等之吃食、</p>
<p>▲船員脫險　嗣因金山丸一時無救出希望、船員等準備離輪、當經磋商之下、由金山嵩山兩輪、會電滬社、請示結果、准將各船員及買辦陳昌華·並賬房管事等·先由嵩山丸輪救出、載回上海、昨日滬社續得電告、嵩山已將救出買辦部分與船員部分等人、離汕開滬、約明日可到上海、</p>
<p>▲貨將抛棄　現在金山丸擱在礁上、雖尚未全沉、但船底破洞、益形擴大、中艙底亦已損裂、各貨艙統浸海水、該輪載重一千七百十噸、裝有荳子一萬餘袋、勢將完全抛棄、但該社猶冀將艙面貨物駁卸一部、故除船主外、酌留海員十餘人在輪、以資看守、俟派拖駁前往、試卸艙面貨件、所有該輪之留守人員、暫由日艦竹號、接濟食物與保護、</p>
<p>▲擊退海盜　汕獨外海匪氛甚烈、金山丸失事後、即有海盜一批、擬圖刦搶、嗣被日艦擊退、查金山丸本爲大阪公司之船、上年由日清購入、用作擴充南北洋繞航班輪、今次失事、連同船身貨物及船員行李等項、損失當在二十六七萬元、猶幸該輪不搭乘客、故無喪害人命事、</p>

<p>▲六甲丸擱礁　日本郵船會社六甲丸、由横濱開來上海、船内裝貨一千餘噸、並搭客華人二十餘人、在四號早晨、船到門司港外、約行三海哩、即遇大霧、當時海面航道、已被蔽没、不能認識、六甲丸誤開至暗礁石上、船身擱牢、旅客大起恐慌、幸未觸穿、即由船主急電總社求救、經過八小時之久、日郵社始派大號施輪、到門司外、收六甲丸由礁石上曳出、拖回門司港碼頭上停泊、派潛海夫人水視察、見輪底在曳救時、已被礁石擦破、不能航海、遂經議定、蔣六甲丸中貨物、即時起、出轉入三笠丸中、即旅客亦在門司上陸、改乘三笠丸輪來滬、六甲丸本定今日進口、今因擱淺修理、不能駛滬、而代運貨客之三笠丸、輪須至九號方可進口、昨已由該社通告各客家矣、</p>

<h3>曁南足球眞茹藍球隊征菲記（六）</h3>

<p>（一）中西校友歡宴</p>
<p>本月十七日爲小吕宋中西學校校友會歡宴曁南足球隊眞茹籃球隊之期、本訂昨夜舉行、因昨下午六點半、有籃球比賽、故改訂今天、其中盛况、亦有可記價值、</p>
<h3>校友會歷史</h3>
<p>中西學校有三十餘年之歷史、在菲島僑校中資格最老數年來日夜課學生皆在千人以上、現在畢業出校校友、以數千計、散在商學報各界服務、以及銀行服務海關繙譯、（現馬里刺海關移民部傳譯員、皆其出校校友、）如僑界著名律師高祖川、少年慈善家兼體育家林珠光、皆爲十餘年前校中高材生、故論各華僑社團之團結堪稱該校友會爲中堅因會員多少時游戲伴侣至長大時、再爲一種結合、自然有許多說不出之興趣也</p>
<h3>與曁南學校關係</h3>
<p>在學生方面、回國轉學求高深學問者、自然來此南僑惟一最高學府、故現時旅菲曁南同學會、過半爲中　西學校舊校友、在職敎員方面、則曁大過去姜·柯·趙·舊校長、與現在鄭校長、及劉士木諸先生、皆時通聲氣、而此回領隊陳學諤君又爲該校舊敎員經林珠光君資送往美國留學者、故在諸球隊未到以前、該會籌備歡迎時、即先用無線電到船中歡迎、及抵岸時、聯隊到碼頭歡接、表示十二分誠意與愛護、</p>
<h3>歡讌情形</h3>
<p>假座西人所設之MignonHotel綿敏大飯店包租全廳、門外用中英文大書「中西學校校友會歡讌曁南足球隊眞茹籃球隊」於長方白紙皮上、校友某律師高祖川、木商會會長許友超君、等五六人、皆掛襟章往來招待、黨國旗與美菲國旗掛滿窗前食筵排作而形、七時旣屆、來賓即將到齊計校友一百多人、足球隊及籃球隊員二十九人、（陳鎭和君因第一次比賽未能大勝特勝、故兩番宴會皆不到）來賓中如總商會陳迎來君、華僑敎育會會長林西錦君、律師薛敏老君、西醫鄭漢君、各橋校校長、各華字報記者、中西學校現任及退任職敎員、及商界名流八十餘人、計到會者二百餘人、歷屆各社團公讌、到會未有若是之多、至其時間之準確、亦空前所未有、（僑界讌會公訂七時常至八時人數常未齊到）可見僑界對此回征　隊、有相當注意焉、席間　正席林珠光君述開會宗旨、略謂此二十年之民國最引起僑</p>

<h3>記善射擊之鍾紹葵·鉞·夫</h3>
<p>鍾紹葵。閩西汀州人也。曩隸獨立四師張貞及新編第一軍譚曙卿部下爲營長。刻作汀屬救鄉團軍事領袖。身懷絶技。自幼即嫻拳藝於手槍射擊術尤有精深之研究。聞渠十二齡時。匪徒圍掠其鄰家當舗。彼即能以鳥槍擊斃匪徒二事平。其父奇之。使之改習軍事。後官至營長。猶日以習練射擊爲常功。五年。技乃大成。今則在二十步内。放射手槍。鮮不中者。</p>
<p>去秋余以事還鄉。晤紹葵於上杭軍次。歡若平生。某日午後散步西郊。偶見野鼠在隴頭覓食。余曰。子擅槍法。曷不擊之。彼聆余言。遂出勃郎林。猝發一彈。一鼠果應聲斃。佘贊不絶口。彼則曰。此亦歐集中賣油翁所謂「無他但手熟耳。」旋過一農家。簷際有巨蛛結網。彼語余曰。今吾小試吾技矣。子且止。此蛛吾能於十步外擊之也。未幾。砰然一聲。蛛果不見。惟此時農家子不知來人底細。都笑曰。蜘蛛亦畏槍聲。被人慌走矣。余則告之曰。蜘蛛不畏槍聲。實中彈死耳羣孩曰。有是者。果能請此君再發一彈。擊斷此蛛網之東端一絲者。吾等始置信。余請於紹葵。紹葵曰。善。姑試之。執手槍略事瞄準。擊之。而東端之蛛絲果斷。羣孩目擊一部分蛛網隨風飄盪。僉鼓掌曰。奇哉。此君之槍法抑何神也。</p>
<p>據鄉人言。已已秋。紹葵計擒匪首湯學</p>
<h3>談松江之天馬山頴川秋水</h3>
<p>蘇州之天平山。多名勝古蹟。故昔年遭人採石。曾施禁令焉。今松江之天馬山。又以採石聞矣。天馬山雖不及天平之著名。然其名勝古蹟。亦甚可觀。兹據松友談及。謂天馬山在松江縣之北境。機山（以晋人陸機得名）之東。以其形似天馬。故以爲名。又稱干山。則以春秋時吳人干將與妻莫邪。鑄劍於此之故。而晋人陸機雲。兄弟。曾在山中讀書。因此圓智寺中。曾有二陸草堂古蹟。而元代楊鐵崖陸居仁錢思復三人。素相友善死後俱葬於此。故山中又有三高士墓焉。觀此知天馬一山。要亦足當名勝之一。今松人士對於採石一事。咸期期以爲不可。而羣起以期保全之。其意或亦在於此乎。</p>
<p>銘於讌席中。部曲咸繳械。去年五月八月閩西紅匪傅柏翠等二度大舉來犯上杭城。皆爲所敗。妻某氏。亦知槍法。嘗助其夫征匪事詳汕厦各報。人多知之云。（却酬）</p>
<h3>匪窟歸來之新郎荆夢蝶</h3>
<p>歲尾年頭。盜風愈熾。常州四境。綁票時聞。然其間所遇。亦有幸不幸焉。奔牛附近一村。有張氏子者。新婚甫三日。而盜黨忽臨。席捲洞房中物。且架新郎以去。遺言索票價千金。而張非富家也。惟時新婦在室好夢初圓。罡風忽至。眼見其如意郎君出鴛閨而入虎穴如此生離。甚於死别。其苦痛可知也。則趨而長跪阿翁之前。泣求設法救夫。翁蹙然曰。家故貧。爾等婚費。尚出借貸。我負債之身。更何來鉅金以償盜欲也。婦知其不可謀。痛哭終宵。坐以待旦。所謂涙盡羅巾夢不成也。翌晨遂歸而謀諸父母。顧以盜所欲者奢亦有愛莫能助之勢。相對憂惶。計無所出。旣而盜方偵知主家眞相。與新婦苦情。慨然减價至百金。傳語張氏。婦聞之喜多方籌措以報命。明日。張子果歸矣。自頂至踵。煥然一新。冠履衣裳。皆盜所贈也刦物亦悉數璧還。惟一提箱已非故物。盜因損其一角。遂爲市新者以易之也。張子臨行。更爲大放編爆。爭致新婚頌辭以送之道旁人看新郎幾忘其爲刧後餘生已斯誠不幸中之大幸也。盜亦有道。其信然歟。</p>
<h3>奇孩黄影呆</h3>
<p>一昨之日。有客自故鄉來。述及某氏新産一孩。生理方面。與衆不同。亟録之。</p>
<p>▲娶妾得子　朱家閣附近。有安莊鎭者。水道四通。河川特多。爲盜匪出没之處。鎭中有某氏者。家道小康。年已不惑。惟膝下無嗣。引爲憾事。乃於前年新蓄一姜。逾年。妾竟得孕。大腹便便。合家欣幸。臨盆之日。果舉一雄。某氏晚年得子。中心之歡。亦可想而知矣。</p>
<p>▲奇怪生理　詎此孩落地後。一經細察。生理方面。與平常嬰孩不同。生殖器並無大異。而糞門處又露出一物。長約五六分。一與前面之生殖器無異。一人兩陽。聞者以爲怪物。而某氏至此。中心亦頗不快。急欲設法去之。然殺之可惜。棄之可憐。亦不無進退維谷之概也。</p>
<p>▲送入嬰堂　嗣後與親友一再商議。决將此孩送入育嬰堂。乃僱一老嫗。星夜乘舟前往。送之朱家閣育嬰堂中。嫗知此孩有異。中心忐忑不安。深恐育嬰堂當場發覺。送官究辦。故一俟堂中接抱嬰孩後。</p>
<h3>巴黎物語（二四）</h3>
<p>十四羅馬殖民時代的露天劇場</p>
<p>世間有許多城市是專門給人家去搜尋古蹟的。如地中海沿岸那些古文明的舊都是。反之在許多新建的國家如南北美諸邦。那兒的城市却只是青春和强力的誇耀。我們如果去遊意大利的都城羅馬。我們一定感覺過去征服着現在。到處都是歷史的追懷。那些敗井頽垣的古蹟裡面到處都有幾千年的幽鑿隱伏着。但我們去遊紐約時。我們的感想便完全不同了。我們只有對於現代文明的驚歎。在那兒我們如果偶然回想到昨日。也無非使得自已對於今天的進步更加歎訝。可是巴黎呢。巴黎却完全不同。旣非羅馬。也非紐約。同時又可以說羅馬與紐約兼而有之。巴黎是一個古而又新的都城。在這兒二十世紀最新的物質文明和二千年前的斑爛古蹟相輝映。在國立歌舞劇塲OPera附近那些繁盛街道走過一圈之後。你再回到拉丁區内的小巷去閒逛。你會感到自已在一日之間穿越了若干世紀。從現代文明的表象最新式的地道車出來之後。隨便走到那一條街。你也許可以看到一座狠舊的幾百年前的建築或是一具有名的閱歷過許多興亡的彫塑。往古和現今相混雜而又並不使人覺得不調和。這便是巴黎的特徵。</p>
<p>把這種古今相混的形象表現得最好的。要算第五區的一個古蹟羅馬殖民時代的露天劇塲了。距植物園不遠。在一條狠新式的呌做rueMonge的大街左近。我們可以見到一個圓形的廣塲。周圍有一層一層累積着的秩序井然的石級。正像漸漸高上去的最新式的劇塲的座位一樣。這便是千五百年前羅馬人統治高盧民族gaulois時代在古巴黎吕特絲Lutece留下的一個遺跡。現在通稱吕特絲鬭技塲Lesarenesdelutece</p>
<p>即飛奔而去。</p>
<p>▲發現秘密　育嬰堂内。見此嫗神色慌張。知必有異。然亦未疑此孩有二陽也。旣而由堂中乳母換尿布時。見此孩臀後多生一物。始知奥妙。急飭人入市覔老嫗。詎已杳如黄鶴矣。</p>
<p>▲死者何多　嗣後育嬰堂方面。亦無可如何。祇得將此奇孩暫爲保養。不料自此孩進門後。堂中其他嬰孩。相繼病亡者。竟有六七人之多。一時迷信之人。咸謂此孩爲不祥之物。促主事者從速去之。以免後患。</p>
<p>▲暴屍街頭　堂中主事之人。以他孩之死。與此孩無關。故仍照常護領。詎相隔不久。此孩亦因病而亡。堂中以此孩生理頗奇。死後曾將其遺屍。暴諸街道。一時觀者雲集。莫不稱異云。</p>
<h3>吳門趣掌故維摩第二</h3>
<p>自由談前載吳中顧子山。解組後築一怡園。時花種竹。詩酒自娱。其事信有之。但余幼時聞父老言。顧築園之資。皆前任浙江甯紹台道時宦囊中物。故園成後有滑稽子見其題額。即調侃之曰。一心不忘甯紹台耳。蓋因怡字拆開。爲心與台二字也。可謂謔而虐矣。</p>
<p>同光中潘順之太史。任蘇州紫陽書院山長數十年。前後山長。無有及其久者。但潘閱卷時。頗具成見。超等前列皆一時能文而知名之士。其餘則以位置其親戚故舊焉。惟特等中間有寒素之士。厠乎其間。但亦居少數。有某生者。每試輒居劣等。胸中積忿已久。某年適值潘七十整壽。預作自壽詩。徧徵諸生和作。其原詩印刷後。隨試卷發出。并預囑帳房中凡送和詩來者。犒賞必從豐。某生即瞷潘不在。投之以詩。帳房中不敢啓封。惟照例開銷而已。及潘歸。啓封視之。見其首二句曰。順之潘公年七十。老而不死是謂賊。潘雖憤不可遏。然亦無如之何也。</p>
<p>陸鳳石相國登第後。有人謂陸若入閣。滿清必亡。後其言果騐。人因謂前此言者之有先見。余謂陸未第時。落拓不覊。嘗有游街城隍之號。其見輕於社會者已久。一旦大魁天下。人必有不服者。故造作此語以揶揄之。不謂其竟成語讖耳。</p>

<p>其對面中間陳列着奔騰欲躍的駕車的雙馬。不僅雙馬之奔騰的動的表現和姿勢描摹的都正確。就是前足後足之間。也藴蓄着不絶的躍動。顯出生命潑辣之感。他是題名爲Bige或者Chariot　a　deux　chevaux作者姓名不詳據其作風推測。我們不妨認這個是希臘彫刻達於完成時期的作品。</p>
<p>這裏的瑰寶太多了。眞是「珍異塞途。應接不睱」呢。我又接連看了三四十件大小不等的石頭。或是一個大頭顱。或是一段殘缺的身軀。從一片一片去研究無一不是稀世之珍。然在此處大的東西太多不免掩蓋了他們。而我這裏也只好從略。逐漸走到salleencroixgrecque裏面去。中央的檯上就有前述的名匠派克西迪力士Praxiteles所苦心製作的維娜斯venus石像高十呎。露着半身。雙手拽着衣裾的女神。這是希臘神話中的司「愛」與「美」的女神。這是派克西迪力士的得意的作品。全體都極其秀美。乳峯高聳。廣額緑眼。顯出温柔的情緒。頭髮用着粗彫的手法取得繪畫上的光的效果。這維娜斯像在女性裸體的表現上。含有至極重要的意味。是帶着人間味的美妙的神像在以前婦人裸身像和男子的肉體没有多麽顯著的分别。從他爲始。才把女性的肉體所特有的魔力和美感盡情表現了出來。所以才成劃時期一種作品。</p>
<p>只有他們的歌聲還能使百世之下的我們能夠聽到。他們揮使着雙手。拿着頑鈍的小刀彫　一塊粗石。與以種種非凡的生命。榮光偉大。是無終無極的生命之一。創造邦　滃parthenon與奥林比亞大神的婓地亞斯。與上面所述的米洪。派克西迪力士。婁西波斯等許多希臘的大師。他們和其餘的雅典人一樣。是自由邦的市民和多神敎的信徒。在練身塲中敎養長大。角力。裸體。於廣場上討論國事。投票選舉。以至在他們的人生觀中最重的幾點。也和同時代的希臘人一樣。他們崇高的情趣。優雅的面影。偉大的發見與創造。也决不是偶然的。</p>

<h3>洋厘疲後轉昂</h3>
<p>▲市塲概况　昨日洋市因汕厦帮略有購裝消息、銀行亦買進不少、故厘價忽爾由疲轉昂、然購胃不若往前之盛、是以交易亦不甚旺、結果厘價略漲厘許、惟銀根益濫、竟無市價可開、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格　「洋厘」早市爲七錢二分一厘二毫半、午市爲七錢二分二厘一毫二忽半、結果較前日早市改昂一厘七毫半、「銀拆」早午市均爲白借爲去年下半年未有之新紀録劃頭當然白劃無加水</p>

<h3>金融界結束聲中一瞥</h3>
<p>銀錢業此次結束賬略、較往年困難倍屣、蓋用國歴以來、爲創舉之辦法、故各外埠往來商號、對此收束還欵問題、頗多觀望、現在收欵期限日迫一日、勢須趕緊終了緣是近日來各埠滙欵及裝洋紛沓而至、但銀錢業放欵總額厥數甚偉、照目前大概核計、仍不過收至什之三四、而大部份欠額猶在宕空之間、甚望此星期中、有大好成績、否則缺銀家將受影響耳、</p>
<h3>證劵債市稍堅</h3>
<p>昨日各公債市况、期貨仍佳、現貨做開種類頗多、但交易仍零星至各債情形仍屬穩定、求供亦平、債價比前計二十年捲烟小三四角、整六亦稍疲、惟其他各債比前日均回漲二三四角不等、計現貨交易共五萬二千四百元内一九關約佔三萬三千元、其他均僅數千元、期貨成交七百八十五萬元、内一九關一九善編遺裁兵二十年捲烟均頗北其他仍清</p>

<h3>紗花紗市漲風愈厲</h3>
<p>▲跟同棉市一再孟晋</p>
<p>紗市趨堅、漲勢激烈、但現紗銷路停滯、因結賬期近、各帮無意採辦、因之交易岑寂、然本埠市氣狂漲不已、因匯票奇縮、致外棉進口價格高昂、而原棉步步飛漲、紗市帶起、一般散户視環境不良祗得忍痛斬結、故愈趨愈緊、此種漲勢、殊爲可畏前途若何、殊難逆料也</p>

<h3>棉市漲風怕極</h3>
<p>棉市漲風之熾·爲近來所罕見、實以外棉市價趨漲、而滙票難長以致銀盤合價大漲、新做多者及投機家蜂擁而來、於是塲内買氣愈演愈烈賣方皆不敢貿然舉動、故祗聞買聲、賣户頓告絶跡、故遂有此激烈之漲勢也、四十兩關口已近、然勢熖仍汹前途如何、須依滙兌爲進退也、</p>

<h3>糧食陰雨中米市平靜</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日各帮到船三十餘號、市銷因天雨河斛難開、故交易寥寥、北粳去化清淡、價格平定、薄稻進出更稀、形勢極靜、羊杜埠秈賣氣贖</p>
<p>不振、祗棧貨稍有成交、行情無甚榮辱、變陰元河中存積殊厚、此貨久擱殊不相宜、大勢因呈定中帶軟之象</p>
<p>▲滬南　昨日河下到源十餘號、本街去路轉呆、各方大都因天雨而未臨市、常錫北　與蘇同機粳祗少數零拆交易、價與上日相彷、南路各薄早稻銷場見滯高貨穩而中次軟、羊杜尖到銷兩稀、市無上落、變陰元走銷清淡、且高貨無多、市仍平庸、</p>
<h3>穩定清閒之粉麥市</h3>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>French Author's Proposal Regarding Germany</h3>
<p>People often say that the differences between France and Italy are gradually widening, which is a hidden worry for the future of world peace. However, in addition to France and Italy, the inability of France and Germany to reconcile their opinions is also a major obstacle to the future of peace. In recent years, important figures in the political and parliamentary circles of Germany have strongly advocated revising the Young Plan to reduce reparations. However, the French public opinion has generally expressed opposition. Therefore, the world generally believes that this matter will be a major point of contention between France and Germany in the future. Now, a piece of news that can explain the opinions of both sides has suddenly emerged, namely, the proposal put forward in an essay by the renowned French author, Mr. André Maurois. He advocates that France should automatically reduce half of its claims against Germany according to the Young Plan. On the one hand, it should sign a military agreement with Germany to strictly limit the military expenditures of both countries. Other countries, if willing, can also sign similar agreements with France. Former French Prime Minister Édouard Herriot also extremely agrees with his proposal. It is believed that if this proposal is realized, not only can the misunderstandings between France and Germany be completely resolved, but also the cooperation in military expenditures can eliminate a major obstacle to the disarmament conference. The future of peace may easily generate new hope from this. This is truly a welcome piece of news. A Paris dispatch also stated that French newspapers have welcomed the joint underwriting of short-term bonds guaranteed by the German Federal Railways by French and German banking circles. They say that this move can encourage French banks to lend to German businesses and pave the way for French loans to Germany. Although this is a minor matter, it can lead to economic cooperation in the future. This is also a sign that the opinions between France and Germany are gradually converging.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Generals Discuss Streamlining</h3>
<p>The Railway Protection Army is Accepted by Zhang</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie is Still Problematic</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Shang Zhen hosted a banquet at his private residence on the evening of the fourth for Ji, Hu, Xu, Yang, Fu, and various army commanders and commanders, totaling more than 20 people. This was the first meeting of Shanxi generals at Shang's residence after the Shanxi situation dispute. During the banquet, there was still discussion on the streamlining method. The general principles and implementation steps have been decided. Ji, Shang, Xu, and others intended that once the streamlining issue is resolved, the four army commanders and eight division commanders should first send a telegram to assume their positions in accordance with the Tianjin Agreement. After assuming their positions, they should then send a telegram to the Northeast to explain their difficulties and request their understanding and adoption. The army commanders intended that Shanxi should draft a joint telegram to Chiang and Zhang, requesting for leniency after continuous deliberations, in addition to the eight divisions stipulated in the Tianjin Agreement. The Zhengtai Railway Protection Army has been accepted by Zhang. At present, the only problem is the gendarmerie. As for the military committee, it is set up internally, and the army commanders are still referred to by their original titles externally, so there is not much difference in practice. It seems that the Northeast should be telegraphed first, and only after receiving a reply should they assume their positions. This point is still pending agreement and has not been fully decided. The draft telegram to Chiang and Zhang has indeed been drafted and is awaiting dispatch. (Fifth Daily Telegram)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Gu Renfa came with Wu Zhenglai, a special envoy from the National Government, on the evening of the fourth. According to Gu, he visited Chiang more than ten times in Beijing, and the result was very satisfactory. Chiang did not insist on the Tianjin case and only hoped to maintain principles. He was quite understanding of the difficulties in the telegrams of the army commanders. He ordered that the requested flexible measures be directly negotiated with Zhang. Wu's mission, in addition to explaining Chiang's good faith opinions on the aftermath of Shanxi to the generals, is also to investigate the situation of Shanxi currency and the financial situation of the entire province. The army commanders scheduled a dinner party for Gu and Wu on the evening of the fifth. (Fifth Daily Telegram)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Fu Zuoyi visited Ji, Hu, and others on the fourth and had a long conversation. He plans to hold a discussion meeting with the generals in the next few days to explain past misunderstandings and his own views on the main purpose of streamlining. Fu told reporters that the reorganization and disbandment of the Jin-Sui Army is something that should be done after the end of military affairs, but the actual difficulties must be resolved. The welfare of the people must be the premise. As for personal status, it is absolutely not a problem. If the army can be safely reorganized and disbanded, I can resign from the position of army and division commander, he said. (Fifth Daily Telegram)</p>
<h3>Huang Xuchu Telegraphed Hong Kong from Nanning to Deny Rumors</h3>
<p>The Eighth Route Army Still Monitors Zhang and Gui</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Huang Xuchu and Wei Yunsong telegraphed Hong Kong from Nanning on the fourth, saying that everything is normal here and that rumors are not credible. (Fifth Daily Telegram) (Hong Kong) It is reported that the Eighth Route Army troops are still in Binyang, Hengzhou, Litang, Daqiao, Wuyi, and Guixian, monitoring Zhang and Gui, but they are not taking military action. There are no reports received by the Eighth Route Army about Li, Zhang, and Bai surrendering the arms of Huang Xuchu and opposing Huang's mediation in Beijing. Furthermore, Yan Yingyu's regiment arrived in the province from Guilin on the fifth and transferred to the Beijiang River. From this, it can be seen that the Eighth Route Army has no intention of using force against Gui at present. In addition, Su Min, an important figure in Gui, said that Huang did indeed obtain the consent of Li, Zhang, and Bai before going to Beijing, and they would definitely not make any changes after Huang went to Beijing to trap Huang. The claim that Li, Zhang, and Bai have military actions in Nanning is not credible. (Fifth Daily Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to French sources from Longzhou, the Gui situation is not as serious as some countries are promoting. Li Zongren, Zhang Fakui, and Huang Chen had negotiated surrender beforehand, and Bai also agreed. Currently, only Bai is resisting. Bai killed many youths in Guangdong and Guangxi in the past. This time, he is deliberately trying to please the communists by singing a high tune. It is found that Bai is originally a Hui and also a member of the Banner people, originally named Chongxi. His father was stationed in Guangxi. Li Zongren and Zhang Fakui already have evidence of obeying reorganization and disbandment, it is said. (Fifth Daily Telegram)</p>

<h3>Maritime Administration Bureau Is Being Organized</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) The five maritime administration bureaus planned to be established in the country are now being organized. However, the main purpose of setting up the bureaus is to recover maritime administration on the one hand and to unify management on the other. Therefore, personnel must have maritime legal knowledge and management skills. They can deal with maritime diplomatic incidents at any time. Therefore, the selection of personnel is quite difficult. After the establishment, the duties of the customs in inspecting ships will be transferred to the maritime administration bureau. Regarding the collection of fees, if the customs collects 100 taels, the maritime administration bureau plans to collect 100 yuan to reduce the burden on maritime merchants.

<h3>Provisional Law for Supervising Local Finances</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The draft of the detailed rules for the implementation of the provisional law for supervising local finances, drafted by the Ministry of Finance, has been reviewed by the Executive Yuan. The second article of the detailed rules changes the procedure in the original Article 4 of the law, which required provincial and municipal governments to submit budget settlements to the Executive Yuan, which would then forward them to the Ministry of Finance for review before submitting them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and resolution. Instead, it would require provincial and municipal governments to consult the Ministry of Finance, which would then forward them to the Executive Yuan and then submit them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and resolution. In addition, Article 5 adds provisions regarding the land tax of various counties and cities, which should be calculated together with the surcharges and should not exceed 1% of the land price. These were not stipulated in the original provisional law. Therefore, the ministry was ordered to revise the original provisional law again and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review in accordance with the standards for drafting laws and regulations.

<h3>German Radical Right Wing Initiates Movement to Dissolve Parliament</h3>
<p>Request to the Interior Minister to Order the Solicitation of Signatures for Convening a National Assembly</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 4th. The German radical right wing today officially began a movement to dissolve the Prussian Parliament and has requested the Interior Minister to order the solicitation of signatures for convening a National Assembly. According to German constitutional regulations, the National Assembly requires the signatures of more than 10% of the electorate within two weeks. The movement is backed by the National Socialist Party and the German National People's Party and should be able to meet this legal requirement. However, even if the assembly is convened, it is unlikely to pass the proposal to dissolve the Prussian Parliament, as it is expected that the vote will barely exceed one-third of the electorate.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 4th. German Foreign Minister Curtius, at the sixtieth birthday celebration of Dr. Schnee, the last German governor of German East Africa, reiterated Germany's right to colonies, stating that German public opinion is divided on whether Germany should have the right to colonies. However, to maintain Germany's equal status with other powers, it is necessary to strive for this right.</p>
<h3>Earthquake Strikes Napier Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Not a Single House Remains Standing in the Town</p>
<p>Rescue Teams are Working Hard</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Napier, 5th. Another earthquake struck this town this afternoon, causing even greater panic among residents. The Red Cross now estimates that over a thousand people have died. Rescue teams are finding many mutilated bodies in the rubble and are occasionally able to find two or three survivors. The rescue teams are now requesting that the railway authorities provide more trains so that residents can leave the area as soon as possible. Prime Minister Forbes of New Zealand has asked all churches to observe February 8th as a national day of mourning.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Wellington, 5th. Napier, which was a prosperous town with a population of 20,000 and a safe harbor, is now completely unrecognizable. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it no longer exists on the map. The earthquake on Tuesday created a desolate landscape with not a single house standing, streets completely destroyed, and the mountains behind the town collapsed, burying houses under piles of rubble. The coastline has also collapsed by a hundred feet. Residents said that the earthquake was almost a straight line, with the ground shaking downwards. Hastings, twelve miles from Napier, suffered the same disaster. Residents who could not escape died either from being crushed or from the fire.</p>
<h3>Turkish Rebel Executed by Hanging</h3>
<p>A Cleric Escapes Just Before the Hanging</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Constantinople, 4th. Of the thousands arrested for participating in revolutionary activities last December, the first group of 78 defendants were sentenced to death, but the Parliament reduced the number to 28. Yesterday, the executions were carried out. The hands of each prisoner were tied behind their backs, and a sign was placed on their chest stating "Criminal Guilty of Treason Against the Kemalist Republic." Among these 28 were several imams and clerics. Soldiers escorted them separately to the gallows. At that time, it was not yet dawn, the streets were dark, and there were no pedestrians, as residents were not allowed to go outside before 8 a.m. under martial law. One cleric, named Hussein, took advantage of the guards' lack of preparedness, managed to untie himself, and dashed past the sentry line. The soldiers were caught off guard, and by the time they opened fire, he had run far away and disappeared. It is said that one Jewish man adjusted the noose around his neck and calmly faced death.</p>
<h3>British Airship Disaster</h3>
<p>Four Rescued Out of Twelve</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 4th. A large airship belonging to the British Air Force encountered a disaster in the Lyme Bay this morning. The airship exploded on the water and then fell into the sea. There were twelve crew members on board, only four of whom were rescued, but one of them died in the hospital from serious injuries. Personnel have been dispatched to the water to retrieve the bodies of the remaining seven. The cause of the airship's accident is unknown, but it is speculated that the driver mistook the horizon due to sunlight reflection. The airship was well-equipped with various safety devices, but the accident happened suddenly, and the equipment was of no use. Another dispatch states that divers have recovered two bodies and found that the airship's body was split in two. The front section has now been towed to the beach, but the rear section is deeply submerged in the sea, and the remaining bodies are probably inside.</p>
<h3>Government Likely to Concede in Foreign Minister Shidehara's Gaffe Case</h3>
<p>The Minseito Party Issues a Statement of Opposition</p>
<p>Both Speakers Will Serve as Arbitrators</p>
<p>▲ Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. Cabinet Secretary Suzuki Tomi弥 visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi at 7:30 last night to report in detail on the budget committee's progress and other matters and requested instructions on future policies. Regarding the issue of Foreign Minister Shidehara's gaffe, Prime Minister Hamaguchi believes that while Foreign Minister Shidehara's response cannot be absolutely considered a gaffe, there is not much time left for budget deliberations, and it also affects the Diet. It is most important to fully consult between the budget committee and the directors to strive for the smooth progress of the proceedings. Secretary Suzuki immediately conveyed this to Foreign Minister Shidehara and party executives.</p>
<p>▲ Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. The government held an extraordinary cabinet meeting at 6 p.m. last night in the Minister's office in the Diet. As a result of exchanging views on the gaffe issue, most cabinet members advocated that the Minseito Party's opposition to the Seiyukai Party is a separate issue. However, from the government's perspective, it seems that it cannot but retract the problematic statement. However, merely retracting it would inevitably lead the Seiyukai Party to pursue the issue of responsibility. Therefore, it is necessary to attach a reason for the retraction, namely, that the country has approved the London Treaty because it is clear that national defense is not lacking and is believed not to endanger national defense. As for the points that are easily misunderstood, it is regrettable, so the reply of the previous day is retracted. It was also decided to thoroughly discuss the situation today. In short, the gaffe issue is quite painful for the government, and according to general observations, the government is bound to concede.</p>
<p>▲ Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. The party is concerned that if the dispute in the budget committee is not resolved, the budget bill cannot be completed before the 10th, and they are eager to find a solution. Most advocate that although Minister Shidehara's response is not a gaffe, it should be retracted to facilitate the proceedings since it has become an issue. As a result, the party may make concessions to avoid giving the opposition party an excuse to prolong the proceedings. Vice-Speakers Fujisawa and Oyama intend to observe the future situation and will come forward to seek arbitration methods to bring the budget committee to a close as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲ Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. The House of Representatives budget committee on the 4th was chaotic throughout the day and adjourned without conducting any business. The Minseito Party held a meeting of Diet members after the adjournment, where House Director Tamori presented his wishes, saying that the party should fight to the end and advance bravely. If the opposition party obstructs, please leave the countermeasures to the executives. The entire body agreed. The Seiyukai Party also held a meeting of Diet members at the same time, where Ino Mori荣痛 spoke about the insubordination of Prime Minister Shidehara's proxy and the tyranny of the Minseito Party, and then decided on a method for all Diet members to deal with it properly. The executive committee also resolved that even if all 170 members were punished, they would fight to the end.</p>
<p>▲ Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. Regarding the dispute in the budget committee, the Minseito Party held an executive committee meeting in the Diet immediately after the committee adjourned to discuss countermeasures. As a result, they unanimously advocated confronting the Seiyukai Party's challenge and decided to repel it head-on. The violent acts of Seiyukai Diet members will not be tolerated in the future. Later, Secretary-General Sakura announced a statement in the name of the Minseito Party, stating that the Minseito Party has been patiently restraining itself and respecting the opposition party's opinions to maintain the authority of the Diet and striving to guide its words and actions towards stability and fairness. However, the opposition party has been deliberately obstructing the proceedings, such as the budget committee on the 3rd and 4th, shouting insults at the Prime Minister's proxy, which were unbearable to hear. Diet members other than the committee members even attempted to harm Prime Minister Shidehara's proxy, and the Seiyukai Party executives not only did not stop them but instead directed the chaos. Their violent behavior is beyond description. They know that they cannot compete with policies and speeches, so they want to overthrow the cabinet through violence. They are traitors to constitutionalism and enemies of parliamentary politics.</p>
<h3>An Atmosphere of Murder Permeates the Assembly Hall</h3>
<p>The Chairman Announces the Opening of the Meeting</p>
<p>The Opposition Party Forces a Cancellation</p>
<p>▲ Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. The House of Representatives budget committee, which was embroiled in a dispute caused by the gaffe issue, was met with a strong stance from the Seiyukai Party. Therefore, the morning session was adjourned immediately after it opened. At 10:40 a.m., the committee members from the ruling party arrived at the budget committee room first, and the ruling party representatives who were not committee members occupied the audience seats to gain the upper hand. At 11:00 a.m., the opposition party gradually arrived, and a dangerous atmosphere filled the assembly hall, permeated with murderous intent. At 11:32 a.m., Chairman Takeuchi entered the room, but none of the ministers had arrived. At 11:35 a.m., the chairman announced the opening of the meeting, and the opposition party protested loudly, questioning, "What is this opening of the meeting?", "Is this how a meeting is opened?", "Where are the ministers? Have they escaped?" The Minseito Party also confronted them, and the assembly hall was in an uproar. The chairman ordered those in the audience who were not Diet members to leave the room. At this time, Toshio Shimada of the Seiyukai Party shouted angrily, "Not a single minister is here. What is this opening of the meeting? Cancel it immediately!" Toyosuke Hata, Tobu, and others also crowded around the chairman's seat, forcing him to cancel it. Chairman Takeuchi then canceled the opening of the meeting. Before long, Ministers Matsuda Taku and Tawaragi arrived. The chairman announced the opening of the meeting and simultaneously declared that Prime Minister Shidehara's proxy was not attending the committee because he was attending the ceremony for foreign envoys presenting their credentials. At 11:43 a.m., he announced a recess.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Invites Reporters for a Conversation</h3>
<p>Expresses His Views on the Disaster Relief Appropriation Bill</p>
<p>The Cabinet Held a Conversation Session</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 4th. President Hoover, who had been silent on the Republican Party's opposition to the Democratic Party's disaster relief appropriation bill, suddenly invited Washington reporters to the White House today to discuss the bill so that it could be published by them for national discussion. As for convening the next special session of Congress, it is imperative to obtain congressional approval within days. Hoover said that the disaster relief proposal runs counter to the principles of self-government. Furthermore, according to past U.S. precedent, disaster relief matters have always been undertaken by the people, and the main source of funds has never been appropriations from the national treasury. He intends to urge state governments and local organizations to engage in voluntary fundraising and recounted in detail his previous disaster relief work and experience during the European War. He said he was confident that the American people should not be accused of lacking sympathy, as he had been subjected to inhumane and unjust questioning in the Senate yesterday. He concluded by saying that the American people have recently realized that their talents, aspirations, compassion, and resources are sufficient to deal with the current environment. After Hoover finished speaking with the reporters, the cabinet held a conversation session, during which they discussed the absurdity of the Senate and the Democratic Party's proposals. Treasury Secretary Mellon, Agriculture Secretary Wilbur, and the Secretary of the Interior were particularly supportive. Hoover also told reporters that after receiving reports today, he knew that no rural American was in danger of hunger or cold, and that no one in the country should be in danger of hunger or cold. Moreover, charitable organizations are spending more than $25 million on disaster relief efforts. He also read a letter from Red Cross President Payne, stating that the Red Cross is confident that $10 million is sufficient for disaster relief, and that this amount has already been raised.</p>
<h3>Franco-German Debt Issue</h3>
<p>French Writer Advocates</p>
<p>Automatically Reducing It by Half</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 5th. Renowned writer Georges Duhamel published an article today advocating that France automatically reduce its claims on Germany under the Young Plan by half. At the same time, a military pact should be concluded with Germany, comprehensively limiting the military expenditures of both countries. The pact should be renewed every two years, and other countries willing to make similar alliances with France can also do so. Gradually expanding this would lead to de facto disarmament. However, the implementation of this matter must wait until the United States also agrees to reduce its claims on France by half. Former French Prime Minister Herriot has expressed extreme approval of this proposal.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 4th. French newspapers welcomed the joint underwriting of the short-term bond guaranteed by the German Federal Railway's preferred stock by French and German banking circles. They said that although this move is only 700 million francs and is not a large amount, it can encourage French banks to lend to German businesses and be a precursor to French loans to Germany.</p>
<h3>World Church Federation Considers Aiding Chinese Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Geneva, 5th. The World Church Federation held a meeting here today to consider the issue of aiding the victims of the disaster in China. After discussion, it was decided to form a special committee with representatives from several European countries as members. On the one hand, they will work with U.S. relief agencies to carry out a movement to help Chinese disaster victims. On the other hand, they will appeal to European countries to come forward and assume this major charitable undertaking.</p>
<h3>U.S. Capitalists Advocate Reforming Banking Regulations</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 4th. Owen Young attended the Senate Banking Committee today and advocated that U.S. banking regulations urgently need reform. The leader of the committee is Senator Glass, who initiated the Federal Reserve System. Young is a major U.S. capitalist and currently serves as the chairman of the board of the Electric Corporation of America and the Radio Corporation of America. According to various observations, Young is likely to be the Democratic Party's candidate for the next presidential election. Young argued that the legislative authorities must use strong measures to curb the division and competition between national banks, state banks, and weaker economic organizations and adopt uniform regulations to unify the domestic commercial savings banking system. He said that if reforming the regulations necessitates amending the U.S. Constitution, it should not be a concern.</p>
<h3>The British Pay Attention to Far East Aviation</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 4th. The rapid development of China's aviation industry has attracted considerable attention in Britain. Today, the House of Commons asked the government to pay attention to a telegram from Nanjing stating that the Sino-German aviation business has been established between Nanjing and Berlin and is scheduled to begin trial operations on March 1, as well as the addition of an aviation expert to the U.S. Department of Commerce in Shanghai, and inquired what methods the British government is currently adopting to promote the interests of the British civil aviation industry in the Far East. Undersecretary Montague of the Aviation Ministry said that the government is willing to consider any proposals for developing the British civil aviation industry with sympathy.</p>
<h3>Opium Committee Passes Resolutions</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 4th. The League of Nations Opium Committee passed a resolution that all diluted drugs, regardless of their concentration, must be regarded as included in the provisions of the Geneva Opium Convention. It also passed a resolution requesting the League of Nations Council to advise the governments concerned not to issue import and export licenses to well-known drug dealers. Layall, the former Chinese Customs Commissioner and current Director of the Permanent Opium Board, criticized the discrepancy in the weight of opium shipped from Hong Kong to India in 1929, but British representative Dennaven replied that the Hong Kong government has never reported incorrect figures. Layall also called attention to the excessive consumption of opium in the Kwantung Leased Territory. Japanese representative Sato said that he admitted that the situation there was unsatisfactory and was willing to seek improvement.</p>
<h3>The Dutch Authorities Deny That the Netherlands and Belgium are Discussing the Construction of Fortresses</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, The Hague, 4th. The Dutch authorities strongly deny the claim that the Dutch and Belgian staffs are discussing the issue of building fortresses in the eastern part of Belgium and the neutrality of the Netherlands. The news originated in Brussels, and as soon as the news spread, the Dutch Catholic newspaper immediately published an article asking the Dutch government to conclude a mutual defense neutrality agreement with Germany. As a result, various newspapers also started commenting, and it suddenly became a major international issue. For example, one newspaper claimed that Belgium only needs to amend the peace treaty to free the Germans from the restrictions imposed by the Allied Powers, and there will be no fear of German troops invading, and its neutral status can be permanently guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Giant Bridge to Be Built in San Francisco Bay</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 4th. The proposal to build a giant bridge in San Francisco Bay has been advocated for many years, but it has not been realized because the Army Department pointed out that it would hinder the movement of warships and be detrimental to military affairs. Today, it has been approved by the Army Department. In the future, when this bridge is completed, it will greatly benefit the business of the San Francisco Bay area.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Proposes That Women Have Equal Suffrage</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. The government this morning introduced a bill granting women equal suffrage with men in city and town autonomous assemblies. A similar bill was introduced by a Diet member in the previous session and passed by the House of Representatives, but was rejected by the House of Peers. It is believed that this bill will still meet with the same outcome. However, judging from the public's attention to the issue, Japanese women will soon obtain at least limited suffrage. The issue involves 13 million women.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Nanjing Telegram: To all newspaper offices, overseas medical communities, and overseas Chinese: Our country's medicine originates from ancient times. Successive generations have refined its essence. During the medieval period, it declined and was regarded as equal to shamanic divination. The essence of the teachings of Qi Bo and Lei Gong was kept secret and not publicized. Now, the Central Political Conference has resolved to establish a research institute, hoping to organize the inherent culture using scientific methods. We, colleagues, follow this proposal and humbly seek to initiate a preparatory meeting and begin preparations. After repeated circulars, we have invited you to consider this matter. It is now scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting in the capital on March 15 to discuss the methods of proceeding. Please also send three to five medical representatives from each province, two to three from each city, and one to two from each organization. The travel expenses will be borne by the medical organizations of each province, city, and county. We hope that you will be present at that time to provide guidance on everything, so that we can support and continue this interrupted learning together. Your arrival is eagerly awaited. The Central National Medicine Hall Preparatory Committee: Jiao Yitang, Chen Lifu, Zhou Zhongliang, Peng Yangguang, Chen Yu, Chen Diangui, Shi Jinmo, respectfully, Jiang.</p>

<h3>Negotiating Jin Army's Downsizing</h3>
<p>▲ Generals' opinions are gradually converging</p>
<p>▲ But there are still no concrete measures</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The long-troubled situation in Shanxi has recently seen the return of Xu Yongchang and Wang Jingguo, who have been mediating extensively. With the support of Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun, the headquarters meeting on the 27th was attended by all, and opinions were exchanged, showing a great willingness to compromise. According to the resolution of the headquarters meeting, it was originally scheduled to continue the meeting at the original site from the next day to study various detailed measures. However, since that meeting, various parties have gathered and discussed for several days, mostly in private residences or hotels. Yesterday morning around 9 o'clock, Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, and Yang Aiyuan went to the Shanxi Grand Hotel together to discuss with Ji Yiqiao, Chen Xingya, Hu Yiling, and others, and studied in detail the opinions put forward by the various army commanders. Finally, Shang Xu, Ji Hu, and others all believed that the army commanders' proposals should be formally reported to Deputy Commander Zhang, and Shang Zhen also expressed his willingness to relinquish the position of army commander. As for the army commanders' proposal to implement a ten-division system and reduce the total number of troops by one-third, Ji Hu and others intend to follow Deputy Commander Zhang's reply. This meeting lasted for four hours, and Shang Xu and others returned to their residences around 2 p.m. Although the exact results of the meeting are not very detailed, according to someone close to a certain army commander, the meeting of Shang Xu, Ji Hu, and others today was to discuss the results of the previous day's headquarters meeting in full, and to report the priorities to Deputy Commander Zhang. All the difficulties of the Jin-Sui army were also reported incidentally. The post-settlement of Jin-Sui is indeed closely related to today's meeting. At 6 p.m. last night, Xu Yongchang invited the nine army commanders to another discussion meeting at Sun Chu's private residence. Sun Chu, Yang Yaofang, Wang Jingguo, Li Shengda, Li Fuying, Yang Xiaoou, Yang Chengyuan, Zhang Huizhao, Feng Pengzhu, and others were all present. The steps for downsizing and post-settlement measures were discussed. Regarding the army's organizational system, Xu intends to reorganize the Jin army into five armies, each with a seven-regiment system, forming a total of thirty-five regiments. There is also a proposal to abolish the army commander system and organize a military committee, with each committee member responsible for managing military affairs. After much discussion, no satisfactory result was reached, and the nine army commanders still insisted on the clever telegram proposal, saying that by studying and implementing this principle, actual difficulties could be avoided, and the troops could be gradually demobilized, so as not to ruin the local area and harm the people. The results are still pending further discussion.</p>
<p>Ji Yiqiao and others' mission was originally to inspect. After the headquarters meeting the day before yesterday (27th), the meeting's situation was conveyed to Ji and others. It is said that Ji and others always wanted to maintain the Deputy Commander's decree and did not want to convey the matter to Zhang. Therefore, at yesterday's meeting at Sun's residence, it was heard that they planned to directly telegraph Zhang in the name of the generals and Xu Shang, stating the actual situation of the Jin-Sui armies, the difficulties in demobilization, the proceedings of the previous headquarters meeting, and the will of the generals, and requesting Zhang to start from reality. It is said that this telegram is currently being drafted, and once it is completed and agreed upon by all parties, it will be sent. (January 30th)</p>
<h3>Yu-E-Wan Border Pacification Headquarters Moves to Hankou</h3>
<p>▲ Li Mingzhong, Ji Hongchang, and Zhang Yinxiang have all arrived in Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Yu-E-Wan Border Pacification Commissioner's Office, originally located in Xinyang, has recently moved to Hankou for the convenience of command. After Commissioner Li Mingzhong and Director He of the Wuhan Branch exchanged telegrams, they designated the old Russian Consulate in Special District Two as the office site. Li first sent Ji Hongchang, the commander of the 22nd Route Army, and Zhang Yinxiang, the commander of the 31st Division, from Xinyang to Hankou to arrange everything. Ji and Zhang arrived in Hankou on January 31st. Li himself set off southward from Xinyang on the first of this month, leading Chief of Staff Wang Zhenhuai, Secretary-General Lu Hongtu, Adjutant-General Ge Jinzhang, Chief of Military Law Liu Guozhen, Chief of Management Miao Dianqi, and all the office staff. They arrived in Hankou on the morning of the 2nd and immediately began working. That evening, Director He and Xu Yuanquan and Liu Wendao hosted a banquet to welcome Li, and invited Wang Jinyu, Ji Hongchang, Xia Douyin, Zhang Yinxiang, and others to accompany them. During the banquet, Li reported to Director He on the bandit suppression in the Yu border area and discussed the current large-scale bandit communists who are disrupting the E East area. It was generally decided that Xia Douyin and Ji Hongchang's troops would still be stationed in E East as the main force for bandit suppression. Ge Yunlong's troops would leave the Yu border area to Huang'an, and Pan Shanzhai's troops would leave the Wan border area to Qishui, attacking the bandits' flanks. A large-scale joint suppression will be carried out within three or four days. After the banquet, everyone dispersed in joy. Today, the reporter separately interviewed Li, Ji, Zhang, and others and obtained their statements as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Li Mingzhong's speech briefly stated, "Since I was ordered to take charge of the pacification affairs of the border areas of the three provinces of Yu, Wan, and E, I have been following the plan formulated by the Commander-in-Chief, commanding the troops, and combining prevention and suppression, striving to eliminate the bandit communists in the shortest possible time, so that the people in the border areas of the three provinces can live and work in peace. All troops such as Ji Hongchang, Ge Yunlong, Zhang Yinxiang, etc., and Xia Douyin, Pan Shanzhai, etc., who are under my command, have all arrived at the designated locations. After I met with Director He, I have already discussed the border area pacification work once, and will implement it separately according to the original plan in the future. As for the situation in the border areas of each province, I will personally inspect them if necessary, so as to understand the situation in various places and supervise the troops to suppress them nearby."</p>
<p>▲ Ji Hongchang's speech briefly stated, "Since our division was ordered to take charge of bandit suppression, we have been stationed in southern Henan. Under the command of Commissioner Li, we have cleared out several small groups of scattered bandit communists. Recently, a large group of bandit communists from the Wan border area came from the Shangcheng area. After our division pursued them, the bandits injured two pseudo-division commanders and suffered more than 3,000 casualties. Our army also suffered more than 800 casualties and finally repelled them. However, the remaining bandits are still rampant. In addition to Shangcheng, there are still remnants of bandits in the Huangchuan and Guangshan areas. To completely annihilate them, it is necessary to have three divisions of troops to surround and suppress them. Commissioner Li is currently discussing thorough elimination methods with Director He of the Branch, and I have also reported to Director He on the joint suppression in the Yu-E border area. After a concrete plan is negotiated, I will return to defense to supervise the suppression."</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Yinxiang's speech briefly stated, "Although the main force of the communist bandits in northern Hubei has collapsed, they have not yet been eliminated. In the future, the clearing and suppression must be carried out with both military and political forces. Commissioner Li originally planned to convene a pacification conference in Xinyang to discuss concrete measures. However, he received a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, instructing him to follow the second step of the plan for the pacification of the border areas of the three provinces of Yu, Wan, and E. Ji's troops and our division may be assigned the responsibility of pursuing and suppressing, while ordering friendly forces to defend and block. We vow to eliminate the bandits within the deadline. After I pay another visit to Commissioner Li, I will return to Songbu to take charge of clearing and suppressing." (February 3rd)</p>
<h3>Rampant Banditry in Northern Guangdong's Lesser North River</h3>
<p>▲ Li Mingrui's troops capture Lian County from Jianghua</p>
<p>▲ Local bandits in Lianshan and Xingzi and other areas are rising</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Li Mingrui's communist army in southern Hunan has occupied Yongming, Jianghua, and other counties bordering the three provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, and has caused great devastation. According to refugees who recently fled from Jianghua to Lianzhou, when the bandit news spread, the people were already in a state of panic. However, the defense force of the county seat was weak and dared not resist. Therefore, Li's troops drove straight into Jianghua County, established a Soviet puppet government in the city, with Li Mingrui as the chairman, and ordered the Red Army to capture landlords and capitalists. It was found that Li's troops entered the city on the 6th of the month, and began searching, arresting, burning, and killing on the 9th, resulting in hundreds of deaths in three days. All title deeds of land and industries owned by landlords and capitalists were confiscated and burned. Refugees are constantly on the road, with the majority seeking refuge in Lianshan. The people of Lian County felt even more apprehensive after hearing this, because Lian County is only three hundred li away from Jianghua, a three-day journey. Moreover, local bandits nearby are stirring, showing signs of responding to Li's troops. Therefore, in recent days, many people in Lian County have also fled to Yingde in the Northern River with their sons and daughters. According to news from the Yuehan Railway Bureau, refugees from Qinglian, Yangshan, and other areas below Lian County suddenly fled to Yingde Station on January 24. According to the refugees, after Li's bandits captured Jianghua, they took the road through Jianglan and captured Lianshan, splitting into two routes, one to peek into Lian County, and the other to Yangshan. At the same time, Deng Shixi and Huang Kun, local bandits in Lianshan and Lian County, took the opportunity to rise up. Therefore, Taipingxu below Lian County has also been occupied by bandits, and dozens of shops have been burned. Another part of Li's troops entered Guangdong from Jianghua's Baishimen, invading Lianshan. As a result, the communist bandit forces suddenly grew larger. Another part of Li's troops entered Xingzi Market, which borders Lian County and Lechang, via Dongpo from Jianglan. The Guangdong authorities have recently dispatched two aircraft from Kesai to fly to the Lian County area to scout for bandit traces. However, the weather has been bad for several days, and the valleys are filled with thick clouds, making it impossible to discern directions. They flew to the Yingde area and turned back. However, according to investigations, the various bandit forces seem to be divided into three routes to peep into the Greater and Lesser North Rivers of Guangdong Province. One force in Xingzi intends to rush out of Lechang and invade Shaozhou and Shixing. One force in Lian County intends to invade Gongruyuan and exit Longgui. One force in Lianshan intends to attack Yangshan, Qinglian, and Hankuang, and copy out of Yingde. As for Lian County, it was besieged by Li's troops on the 21st. Yesterday, the Pingshi Telegraph Bureau's urgent telegram reported on the 22nd, briefly stating that Lian County was besieged by Li Mingrui's troops on the Horse Day, and Xingzi was also occupied by Li's troops on the same day. On the morning of Horse Day, the telegraph lines in Lian County were cut off, and telegrams sent to Lian County by various telegraph bureaus could not be forwarded. The postal routes in Lian County were also impassable. According to reconnaissance reports, bandit traces were found in Yangshan County on the 24th. Since Yangshan is below Lian County, it can be known that Lian County has been captured by bandits if there are bandits in Yangshan. It was found that the Yangshan local bandits are only about 5,000 in number, and it is difficult for them to find food wherever they go. It is expected that when the government troops arrive to suppress them, it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The Guangdong authorities are currently dispatching the 3rd Independent Regiment of Deng Hui to Ru Yuan to block and suppress them. The 3rd Teaching Regiment of Wang Dinghua and the newly compiled 16th Division's Supplementary Regiment of Liao Daoming are also heading from Yingde to Han Kuang to intercept them. The two regiments of Tan Langxing and Wu Jianxiong are also being transferred back from Xiongshi, with Wu's regiment going to Ru Yuan to assist in the suppression, and Tan's regiment going to Lechang Pingshi to guard against Xingzi and other places. Recently, the Guo Runhua Regiment of the 63rd Division was also transferred back to the province from Mengjiang, Guangxi, and transferred to the Lesser North River to assist the Wang Deng regiments in advancing and suppressing the Li bandits in Lianyang. It is also heard that Yan Yingyu's regiment will also be transferred back from Guizhou during the day to assist in the defense of the Northern River.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Establishes Village Clearance Headquarters</h3>
<p>▲ Ye Chucang reports two missions</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in accordance with the village clearance regulations promulgated by the central government, organized the Village Clearance Headquarters, and legally appointed the chairman of the provincial government as the director, the director of the civil affairs department as the deputy director, and the director of the security department as the affairs director. The staff of each department were transferred from various departments of the provincial government. The headquarters held its establishment ceremony at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (4th) in the auditorium of the provincial government. Lan Weibin, the representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Supervisor, Director He of the Provincial Government, and Director Li, and other guests and staff from various departments of the provincial government, about 300 people, attended. First, Chairman Ye Chucang led the ceremony and delivered an opening speech, briefly stating that the village clearance affairs in Jiangsu Province had been handled by the Department of Civil Affairs since August last year, but the work done could not be carried out as a whole due to the different situations in each county. Today, the establishment of the headquarters can actively carry out village clearance in various counties. The current plan is to order each county to submit the household registration investigation form, joint security form, and firearms inventory form to the headquarters for review within February as the first step. The second step of the work is to send personnel to conduct on-site investigations to address the ineffectiveness of village clearance in some counties and the concern that various counties may have filled out the forms inaccurately, so as to achieve the purpose of village clearance. Next, Lan Weibin, the representative of the Provincial Party Rectification Committee, gave a speech, generally stating that village clearance is the post-settlement work after pacification, and hoped that the government would list village clearance work as the policy direction for this year. Next, Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Supervisor, gave a speech, briefly stating that the people are the foundation of the state, and the foundation is solid and the state is peaceful. Village clearance is a way to secure the people and strengthen the foundation. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has a strong revolutionary spirit, and he believed that the village clearance work would definitely be completed soon. Next, Director He delivered a speech on behalf of the Provincial Government, briefly stating that the military is now pacified, and the whole province should carry out village clearance uniformly, identify the targets, determine the goals, and work towards them, which will surely be effective. Finally, Deputy Director Hu Pu'an gave a reply speech, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. (5th)</p>
<h3>Police Inspector Zhou Runshi Interrogated in Wuxi for Soliciting Prostitutes</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The case of Zhou Runshi, a police inspector of the Department of Civil Affairs, soliciting prostitutes and engaging in adultery with married women in Wuxi. Zhou was detained by the Department of Civil Affairs in Zhenjiang on the 3rd. It was originally scheduled to be escorted to this county the day before yesterday, but he had not arrived by evening. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that at 1:00 a.m. yesterday (5th), Director Hu of the Department of Civil Affairs sent two platoon leaders from the 2nd Battalion of the Guard Battalion to escort Zhou from Zhenjiang by car to Wuxi. He arrived in Wuxi at about 4:00 a.m. and temporarily stayed at the Liangxi Hotel. At 9:00 a.m., Zhou was escorted to the County Government. Then, County Magistrate Pan telephoned Xu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, ordering him to escort the persons involved in the case to the county for interrogation. After receiving the order, Director Xu immediately sent detectives to escort the plaintiff Shen Xiang and the three witnesses, Zhou Xingzhen, the concubine who had been prostituted by Zhou, and Wang Lihong, a local prostitute, to the county for questioning. At 11:30 a.m., County Magistrate Pan personally opened the court in Jingshu Hall for interrogation. Many people watched. After County Magistrate Shen took his seat, he used a vermilion pen to summon each person one by one for questioning. The interrogation was completed at 10:10 p.m. The statements of each person are recorded below:</p>
<p>Wang Lihong: Testified that she was 20 years old and has been a prostitute for two or three years. On the evening of the 4th, she accompanied Commissioner Zhou at No. 83 New World, introduced by Wang Chongxi, and stayed for three days, giving me 15 yuan. I met Zhou Chazhen at New World. I called New World on the evening of the 3rd and asked if Xingzhen was there. The waiter replied that she was at No. 83, so I went there and was introduced to Commissioner Zhou by Wang Chongxi.</p>
<p>Zhou Xingzhen: Testified that she was 20 years old and from Yixing. Commissioner Zhou was introduced by Wang Chongxi to stay in Wuxi for one night, and also stayed with someone surnamed Fang for one night. Later, I went to Suzhou with Commissioner Zhou and stayed for one night. The five yuan was given to me by the person surnamed Fang and transferred to Zhang Chongxi. At 6:00 p.m. on the 28th, I took a car to Suzhou to shop. Commissioner Zhou said he would go to Suzhou with me. We arrived in Suzhou at 7:00 p.m. and stayed at No. 80 Dongwu Hotel. We went out to watch a play and returned to the hotel at 11:00 p.m. and slept in the same bed. At 5:00 a.m., my husband, Shen Xi, took the police to the hotel. Then I went to the police station. Officer Wang questioned both my husband and me. Commissioner Zhou was not questioned. I don't know how it was resolved. I heard that Commissioner Zhou went to Wujiang. My husband and I returned to Wuxi. When I was at the Suzhou Bureau, Officer Wang persuaded my husband. My husband said yes.</p>
<p>▲ Shen Xiang: Testified that he was 20 years old. Zhou Xingzhen was taken in as a concubine in July of the 19th year. Xingzhen used to be a local prostitute and had been opening a room at New World for a long time. After I learned that she was sleeping in the same room with Commissioner Zhou, I went to the hotel to see. Because Zhou was a commissioner, I didn't dare to interfere. According to Xingzhen, she and Commissioner Zhou were from the same hometown and there was nothing else. Later, I went to New World. According to the waiter, Xingzhen and Commissioner Zhou had gone to Suzhou. So I went to Suzhou with my friend Qian Zhenxiang and others at 3:40 a.m. that night. We arrived in Suzhou at 5:00 a.m. Because there was a familiar waiter at Dongwu Hotel, we went to the hotel. We saw that the passenger card for No. 80 was Zhou Shi. Then we went to the door of the room to peek and heard Xingzhen singing in bed. We immediately reported to the police and knocked on the door of the hotel. Zhou Runshi opened the door wearing his clothes and went to the police station together. We transferred to the 2nd Sub-Bureau of the 3rd Branch. Officer Wang persuaded us to resolve it peacefully and told me to take her back and gave me 50 yuan for travel expenses and told me to make a statement. Zhou Runshi also said to me in person that he would give me 50 yuan. Later, we went to the Jingjiang Restaurant to eat. The 50 yuan was a roll of banknotes. I didn't receive it. All the gold bracelets, gold rings, gold watch chains, etc. that Zhou Xingzhen took away could not be determined whether they were taken out last time or this time.</p>
<p>▲ Zhou Runshi: Testified that he was 24 years old, from Yixing, and a graduate of the first class of the Police Academy. This time I came to Wuxi to sleep with Wang Lihong first, and then I was with Zhou Xingzhen. Wang Chongxi introduced me because Lihong and Xingzhen were always together. I stayed at No. 80 Dongwu Hotel in Suzhou. I didn't give 50 yuan to Shen Xiang at the branch. When I was at the Suzhou Branch, Officer Wang said that there was no evidence of abduction, but there was evidence of soliciting prostitutes, so he advised Shen Xiang to take Xingzhen back. After I saw the report in Shengze, I went to the school in Zhenjiang and then to the Department of Civil Affairs, ordering me to go to Wuxi. This matter has nothing to do with Qin Enrui.</p>
<p>At this point, County Magistrate Pan ordered Shen Xiang to go back and wait for the County Court to summon him, and ordered Zhou Runshi, although there was no evidence of abduction, but he was suspected, to wait to be dismissed. In the afternoon, he prepared a letter and transferred the three witnesses, Wang Lihong and Zhou Xingzhen, to the County Court for interrogation. After adjourning the court, County Magistrate Pan ordered the County Public Security Bureau to summon Wang Chongxi to the county and transfer him to the court for interrogation. That night, he reported the interrogation and other details to the Department of Civil Affairs for review. County Magistrate Pan had not transferred Zhou Runshi and others after interrogating them until 5:40 p.m.</p>
<p>▲ Shen Xiang (i.e., Shen Zanru) took Zhou Xingzhen as a concubine in mid-July last year. Soon after, the two sides disagreed and divorced with the mediation of Chen Lishi, Yu Qin, Ying Huamei, and others, and Shen Xiang gave 100 yuan to Zhou Xingzhen (i.e., Xu Shishi) to sever the relationship between husband and concubine. The divorce agreement is as follows: "Shen Zanru, the person who wrote the divorce agreement, is now ordered by his mother to sever the relationship. At that time, with the mediation, 100 yuan was given to Xu Shishi as travel expenses. After the separation, there must be no private gatherings or entanglement of money. If found, the mediator will be held responsible. To avoid future disputes, this is recorded for future reference."</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick Mail</h3>
<p>▲ Wuhu's five inner customs gates have been repeatedly requested by the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce to be abolished early. The Ministry of Finance replied that it would have to wait for a comprehensive plan before it could be determined. According to reliable sources, the Ministry of Finance has decided to change the five inner customs gates to special taxes. A provincial special tax bureau will be established in Wuhu, with 22 special tax branches in various counties. Li, the deputy tax commissioner of the Tianjin Customs, was previously sent to Wuhu to inspect and plan, and it is proposed to appoint Li as the director of the tax bureau. It will be realized in the near future.</p>
<p>▲ The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce is sincerely afraid that the new tax rate will exceed the original Likin tax amount after the Ministry of Finance levied the new supplementary tax after the Likin tax was abolished, so it telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that national economy and people's livelihood be taken into account. The Ministry of Finance replied that the general outline and supplementary measures for business tax in various provinces have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and passed in various provinces. What the association said may be a misunderstanding. I hope to publicize the purpose of the Ministry to revitalize tax laws, so that we can all understand it.</p>
<p>▲ The six-corner passport fee for rice and grain exports levied by the Anhui Provincial Government,</p>
<p>After repeated efforts by Anhui merchants, it was finally agreed to reduce it by two corners, and the actual levy was four corners per stone. Rice merchants are still not satisfied, but because accumulated rice is in urgent need of export, it has been registered and exported at the Wuhu Provincial Rice Certificate Circulation Inspection Office. On the one hand, it is still appealing to the National Government. Today, the Provincial Chamber of Commerce has received an order from the Ministry of Finance, stating that it has been approved by the Executive Yuan to strictly order the Anhui Provincial Government to abolish the new rice certificate donation in order to comply with the original intention of Likin abolition. However, this matter is related to the military and political expenses of Anhui Province, so Governor Chen Diaoyuan has gone to Beijing yesterday to consult with the National Government on a solution.</p>
<p>▲ The 171st Brigade of the 57th Division stationed in Wuhu previously received an order from the Commander-in-Chief's Office, and a review class was immediately sent to Wuhu for inspection. It was recently learned that the inspection is now planned to be suspended or postponed. Therefore, Yue Shengxuan, the commander of the 57th Division stationed in the province, has decided to come to Wuhu for inspection himself on the 10th of this month. The military here is already preparing for it.</p>
<p>▲ According to reports, the Wuhu Public Security Bureau's Detective Team found that bandits were hiding in a Wang family in Rulin Street in the city. The team was immediately dispatched to surround the house. The bandits attempted to resist arrest but failed. A box gun and more than 30 bullets were seized, and seven men and women, including Li Nengcai and Zhou Jiahua, were arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. (3rd)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The planning to organize a cleaning office in Songcheng is making gradual progress. Last year, the First District Office and the County Public Security Bureau designed and planned to organize a cleaning office, dividing the whole city into six districts and soliciting merchants to contract. Later, the Department of Civil Affairs instructed that it was easy to cause monopoly and harm farmers, so it was not approved. Now, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Shen Jingyi, and the district chief of the First District, Zhong Taishi, have repeatedly discussed and re-submitted it to the County Government for instructions. It is heard that the County Government, after receiving the report, has copied the previous order of the Department of Civil Affairs and the reports submitted by the bureau and the district office, and sent them to the Health Movement Committee for reconsideration, and then submitted them to the County Political Conference for review.</p>
<p>A collection of bandit cases from various places. On the 21st of last month, a gang of bandits kidnapped six men and women, including Dr. Xie Zichun, in Jiangzhuang Town, Punan. At that time, it was said that they were shot down by the police team and all were rescued. This is actually a rumor. According to the report, the first to be kidnapped that day were a Shen family member, a girl who had just reached marriageable age, Zhang Zitang's five-year-old younger sister, and the daughter of the owner of Tan Yiji South Goods Store, all of whom lived in Zhang Heng's home. The police team stationed in the mountains was outnumbered, so they were allowed to escape. It is heard that people are now in contact, but none of the six are wealthy. Also, on the evening of the 3rd, more than ten bandits broke into the home of Zhu Anda in Zhangcunbang, 38th Map, Fifth Ward, and kidnapped Zhu Anda's children and nephews. They also entered the bedroom and robbed gold and silver ornaments, and burned all the title deeds they found, causing great losses. The whereabouts of the kidnapped people are currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>

The High Court Prosecutor Zhu Jun, because the day had already passed the office hours, was unable to hold a hearing. He then convened a hearing at 2 PM yesterday afternoon, and because the woman had expressed remorse and the circumstances were relatively minor, he instructed her to find someone to bail her out while the investigation was completed before further action was taken.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Summoning a Large Number of River Workers: Since the audit of Nanshutang River project expenses was referred to the judiciary by the provincial government, the Zhenjiang Court summoned Jiang Rongchu and Zhang Fengtai, directors of the East and West River Bureaus of the project, for repeated interrogations. As a result, because the account books and receipts still needed to be verified, the court ordered the county to issue summons yesterday for Chen Shiqian and Jiang Duanfu, the accountants of the two projects, and more than twenty personnel involved, including Gu Renan and Tang Zixiong, to appear in court. A public hearing and judgment will be held on the afternoon of February 10.

It is now learned that the bidding results have been announced, with the rental price being 36 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen per mu.</p>
<p>Provincial Pawnbroking Representatives Go to the Provincial Government to Petition: The pawnbroking industry throughout Jiangsu Province, because of Article 16 of the new provincial regulations regarding redemption interest beyond one month, which concerns the principal, held a temporary provincial pawnbroking meeting at the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce in December of last year, resolving to petition the ministry and the province to maintain the old regulations. The petition was rejected. The pawnbrokers in various counties then consulted by letter and telegram and unanimously agreed that the pawnbroking industry had become extremely weak in recent years. If the new provincial regulations on redemption interest beyond one month were followed, the pawnbrokers would be unable to survive. If the provincial government could not approve the maintenance of the old regulations, they would all report closures. Su Minsheng, Zhou Guren, Yao Diyuan, Pan Zhixi, Cao Junde, Qin Zhuoru, Qian Sunji, and others were appointed to go to the provincial government yesterday (the 4th) to gather and hold a temporary meeting. The representatives will go to the provincial government today (the 5th) to petition and personally deliver petitions. If the petition is still unsuccessful, they will petition to cancel the old regulations, where interest does not exceed five per month, and to not restrict pawnbrokers from reporting closures, in order to ensure business freedom and protect the principal.</p>

After the meeting, it was heard that he still had to go to Wuxi to attend the joint defense meeting and report important matters to the province in person.</p>
<p>Central Government Plans to Purchase the Iron Qin and Copper Sword Tower Collection: Books are related to a nation's culture and are of great importance. There are four major book collectors in our country: the Yang family of Shandong, the Ye family of Hunan, the Fan family of Zhejiang, and the Qu family of our county, whose Iron Qin and Copper Sword Tower. However, the collections of the first three families have been dispersed due to various calamities. Only the Qu family's collection in our county, starting with Qu Yong during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, has been preserved for more than two hundred years despite countless disasters. It is said that during the Hong and Yang rebellions, the Qu family wrapped the books in dozens of layers of oil paper and submerged them in water, but they were still damaged. When Duan Fang was the Governor of Jiangsu, he once considered purchasing them, but it did not happen. Now it is heard that the central government plans to purchase them with funds for national preservation. Cai Yuanpei of the former National Government and Zhang Zhongren, a gentry from Suzhou, once came to Changshu to negotiate with the Qu family. It is now heard that a special commissioner will be sent to negotiate with the owner of the Iron Qin and Copper Sword Tower regarding the collection of books.</p>
<p>Police and Bandits Clash Fiercely at Zhu Jing Bridge: Zhu Jing Bridge in the Fushan district is adjacent to Haikou and is a place where bandits often appear. Around 11 PM the night before last (the 2nd), more than ten bandit boats were docked near Zhu Jing Bridge in Haikou, planning to land and rob. Yu Changgen, a resident of the area, spotted them and rushed to Tangfang Bridge to report to the police squad. Squad Leader Guan immediately dispatched thirty squad members to the area and sent scouts ahead. The bandits gathered in the woods to discuss their plans, and the police opened fire and dispersed, charging into the woods. Seeing the police, the bandits also fired rifles wildly. After an hour of fierce fighting, more than ten bandits swam back to their boats and fled. The whereabouts of more than ten other bandits are unknown. On the night of the 3rd, two more bandit boats attempted to rescue the dispersed bandits, but fortunately the police were prepared and blocked their landing. The bandits retreated again.</p>
<p>Hostage from Maojia Bridge Oil Shop Released: Yao Shou, the owner, and Xue Yanxing, the clerk, of the Shentongshun Oil Shop in Maojia Bridge outside the North Gate of our county, were robbed and kidnapped on the 26th of last month. It is now heard that Yao and Xue have safely returned home. It is said that they were taken to the port, and after pleading bitterly, they were released. However, Yao has been secretive since returning to the town, and it is difficult for outsiders to meet him. The reason for this is unknown. The oil shop has been heavily in debt recently, and since the incident, creditors have been flocking to the Maojia Bridge shop to demand payment as the settlement period has expired, but Yao has never been seen.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>District Office Meeting to Restore Rice Market: The Zhenjiang First District Office believes that Zhenjiang has no production and relies entirely on goods from other places. Since the rice market moved to Wu, the commercial center has become desolate. Although the provincial government has moved to Zhenjiang, the commercial center has not improved. If Zhenjiang is to be revitalized, the rice market must be restored. Therefore, the district chief convened a meeting of all town chiefs yesterday to set a date to invite key figures in the rice industry to jointly discuss solutions, and appointed Cao Liqing, Wan Zhongping, and Yin Keqin to contact the Party Headquarters and the Chamber of Commerce for all matters.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Handling Inspection of All County Public and Private Firearms: With the bandits and communists in the county pacified, the military, political, and police agencies, in order to eliminate hidden dangers, ordered all districts by the county government to uniformly inspect public and private firearms starting from March 1, with a deadline of half a month to complete the inspection.</p>
<p>County Party Headquarters to Implement Reorganization: Many members of the Nantong County Party Headquarters have been transferred. Reorganization is now being implemented, with Chen Guanying elected as a standing committee member.</p>
<p>Zhang Zha Petitioning for Return of Property: Zhang Zha, a resident of the county, was accused of having evidence of colluding with the enemy when Sun Jun invaded the south in the 16th year. He was charged in the Special Criminal Court but has not appeared in court. The provincial government resolved to issue a warrant for his arrest and confiscate all of his property. Zhang has fled to Dalian. He has now hired lawyer Dong Kang to sue the Nantong County Court, requesting the return of his property. The petition was approved and submitted to the Jiangsu High Court for review.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Tax Collection Methods Determined After the Yun Office Moves North: The Yun Office moved to Guanyun on the 1st of this month, and the Huaibei Yun Deputy has also moved to Yangzhou. Previously, there was talk about the issue of tax collection and shipping orders in Huaibei, and it was originally intended to be completely transferred to the Yangtze Salt Branch for handling. However, Director Wang strongly argued and submitted seventeen proposed methods to Finance Minister Song Yun, who approved them for implementation. Therefore, the current regulations stipulate that although the shipping orders are issued by the Yangtze Salt Branch, the name of the Lianghuai Yun Office is still used. Tax collection is also carried out according to these regulations. As for the allocation of salt, it seems to be within the scope of the branch chief and there are no problems. However, it is heard that Yun Commissioner Wang has not yet gone to Guanyun to confirm.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Finance Bureau Specially Formulates Collection Methods: The Finance Bureau, due to the fact that major households in the city have delayed paying the grain tax, has specially formulated seven collection methods: (1) Order the grain scribes to detail the names and addresses of major households in the urban area and assign police to urge them to pay, holding the name cards of the county magistrate and the bureau chief, requiring a response on the same day without delay. (2) Issue summons and designate clerks Chen Zigang and Jia Huachun to check at all times, and if anyone exceeds the deadline without paying, immediately send them to the county government for arrest. (3) The police's urging of collection should be supervised by clerks Chen Zigang and Jia Huachun at all times, and no negligence is allowed. (4) Designate clerks Cao Jingzhe and Tian Lecheng to be in charge of selecting major households who have not paid and lead the police to their doors to compel them to pay. (5) The director or section chief will personally urge the particularly large households to pay. (6) Request the Public Security Bureau Police Team to send four or six police officers to the bureau every day to be dispatched. (7) The police team sent by the Public Security Bureau Police Team will be given four jiao of ocean (silver dollar) for food each day. The performance will be assessed by the middle of February, and if there are achievements, rewards will be given.</p>
<p>Education Bureau Section Chief Dismissed and Another Appointed: Yang Youqing, the general affairs section chief of the county education bureau, has been absent from his post for a long time. Director Sun has now dismissed him and appointed Gong Liujing to succeed him.</p>
<p>Two Factions of Bandits Clash in Gaoyou: Recently, due to unequal distribution of loot, the bandits in the Zhoujinhe area of the tenth district of the county have split internally. The leaders of the two factions are Yan Shucai, who is based in Yan Family Village of Baoyi, and Zhang, who is entrenched in Zhoujinhe of Youyi. Each faction has more than a hundred bandits. The two factions opened fire on each other for several hours the day before yesterday, and there were casualties on both sides. The animosity has deepened in recent days. Every night, they post sentries and fire guns to demonstrate their strength. Residents in the area are extremely frightened, and those with some assets have been moving away.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Jiaxing-Haiyan Boundary Issue Resolved: The Wangdian District of Jiaxing borders Haiyan County, and the boundary is not clear. Citizens of Wangdian District requested the county government to jointly survey with the Haiyan County government to avoid disputes. Although the two counties sent personnel to jointly survey, the issue was unresolved for a long time due to various problems. Recently, Huang Weiqing and other resident representatives of the Southeast Village of Wangdian District telegraphed the county government, requesting that personnel be sent to re-survey as soon as possible to resolve the issue. The Haiyan and Jiaxing county governments drafted a compromise solution to include the original Southeast Village, etc. of Jiaxing County into the Shuangcun and Lucun of the Yan County of Haiyan County, and to include the Shuangcun and Lucun of the Yan County of Haiyan County into Jiaxing. Having obtained the consent of the local residents, the survey has been completed and the map has been submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs for review and approval.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Major Kidnapping Case Occurs in Guangchen Town: Guangchen Town, which is two or nine li away from Pinghu and is an important route from Pinghu to Xincang, was visited by ninety bandits around 10 PM on the third night. They advanced by land and water, each carrying guns and weapons. They first went to the Quan family in the south of the town to rob, and kidnapped Quan Rongsheng's son and Quan Guanchang's grandson. They then robbed Zhang Zhenxing's rice shop, the Wang family's butcher shop, and the Yuan family, and Zhang Zhenxing's daughter, Jian, and her daughter, Yun'e, were also kidnapped, as well as Yuan Adi's two sons. After robbing until 11 PM, they sent the six male and female hostages to the bandit boat that had been pre-stationed in the West Market and marched in formation to the northeast. When they reached Zhangjiafen in Shicun, they broke into the Xu family and kidnapped Xu Shunguan and Xu Baoquan as well.</p>

<h3>Military Law Review Committee of the Garrison Command Releases Political Prisoners Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Qiu Luanxie and 12 Others</p>
<p>▲Sun Yizhang Dies in Prison from Illness</p>
<p>The Military Law Review Committee of the Songhu Garrison Command held its second review meeting from 1 PM to 4 PM yesterday afternoon at the Longhua Command Headquarters. Five committee members, Zhou Shida, Dai Yuanchuan, Liu Tongyi, Su Fuchou, and Zhong Huan, were present. They immediately decided to grant amnesty in ten political prisoner cases, totaling twelve people: Qiu Luanxie, Weng Chuqing, Gu Jintang, Fang Zheng, Sun Jishi, Peng Yifu, Chen Dazhou, Sun Jiu, Li Ruyi, Deng Heng, Zhang Bingtao, and Chen Shiqing. Among them, Qiu Luanxie is already 84 years old and is a skilled calligrapher. He was arrested in the French Concession in this city during the Yan-Feng War last year and is now specially pardoned and released. Chen Shiqing was originally convicted of counter-revolution and kidnapping. Yesterday, only his counter-revolution part of the charges was pardoned; the kidnapping part was not, so he still cannot regain his freedom. Others are detained in Nanjing, Suzhou, or in the Caohejing prison. Yesterday, official documents were sent to notify their release. As for Brigade Commander Sun Yizhang, a subordinate of Sun Chuanfang, who was decided to be pardoned last Thursday, it is now learned that he died long ago from illness in the Caohejing prison.</p>
<h3>Aviation Plan of the Ministry of Transportation</h3>
<p>▲16 Air Routes Established Nationwide</p>
<p>▲Eurasian and Beijing-Ping trial flights next month</p>
<p>▲Shanghai-Guangdong and Shaanxi-Gansu are being planned</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Agency met with Li Jingzong and Lin Tianlan, section chiefs of the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Transportation, yesterday and inquired about the Ministry's recent facilities for aviation development. Mr. Li answered them one by one. The following is a separate record:</p>
<p>▲Aviation Plan: Mr. Li said that the Aviation Plan of the Ministry of Transportation divides into sixteen routes. The Shanghai-Chengdu line has already opened flights to Hankou, and will soon be extended to Yichang. Eurasian Aviation and Beijing-Ping Aviation will be able to conduct trial flights at the beginning of next month. As for Shanghai-Guangdong Aviation, it is in the planning stage. Two amphibious aircraft purchased for this line can be transported to Shanghai recently. In addition, the most important route is the Shaanxi-Gansu line, which has important relations in military and cultural affairs. The Ministry of Transportation is also planning and preparing for it. Departing from Nanjing, passing through Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Tongguan, and entering Shaanxi and Gansu, it can be carried out as soon as there are economic resources.</p>
<p>▲Mail Distribution: In the past, European mail transported to China via Siberia had to take eighteen days to reach Shanghai, and even the fastest would take no less than sixteen days. After the opening of Eurasian Aviation in the future, European mail will only take four days to reach Shanghai. In the future, the distribution of mail will be as follows: Beijing-Ping Aviation, passing through Xuzhou, Jinan, Tianjin, and reaching Beiping from Nanjing, will specialize in transporting domestic mail. Eurasian Aviation will pass through Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Beiping, Duolun, and reach Manchuria. Before China and Russia restore diplomatic relations, a joint transport method will be adopted. After leaving the country, it will be transferred by the Russian Aviation Company, passing through Irkutsk and reaching Moscow, and then by a company jointly formed by Germany and Russia to fly to Berlin. Because the Russians suddenly claim to be developing commerce, merchants and travelers are searched with great rigor, so passage is difficult.</p>
<p>Eurasian Company: The organization of the Eurasian Aviation Company has a board of directors at the highest level, with nine directors. The chairman of the board is Wei Yifu, and the vice chairmen are Shuang Qing and Schmidt. Among the six Chinese directors, there is still one vacancy, which is being filled. Below the board of directors is a general manager, and below him are three groups: Lin Tianlan and Feng Xike (manager of the German Siemens Foreign Firm) are the director and deputy director of the Finance Group; Schmidt is the director of the Machinery and Aviation Group; and Li Jingzong is the director of the Operations Group. The deputy director has not yet been determined. The various regulations will be discussed and determined after the trial flight. The headquarters is determined to be in Beijing, and the Shanghai office will be a Shanghai branch office. The Shanghai branch office was originally located at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Transportation on Maigen Road. Because the location is remote, it is planned to move to the central district.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Personnel Arrive in Shanghai: The Eurasian Aviation Company has hired two pilots, five mechanics, and one commercial officer from the German Hansa Company. Yesterday (the 4th), they arrived in Dalian in two batches via Siberia and arrived in Shanghai by Dalian Maru and another ship. The first batch of purchased aircraft was originally scheduled to arrive on the 10th, but due to a slight delay en route, it will be extended to the 12th. The second batch of machinists will arrive at the beginning of March, and the second batch of aircraft will arrive on March 15. After the first batch of aircraft arrives in Shanghai, it will take about twenty days to assemble before the trial flight can be carried out. Whether the trial flight will be extended to Manchuria will depend on the equipment along the way.</p>
<p>▲Director Meeting: At 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Lin Tianlan, director of the Finance Group of Eurasian Aviation Company, Li Jingzong, director of the Operations Group, and Schmidt, director of the Machinery and Aviation Group, convened a joint meeting of directors to discuss various preparatory matters and the relocation of the Shanghai office, as well as other important issues. The meeting adjourned after a long time. The reporter asked whether the China Aviation Corporation was liable for compensation for the Shanghai plane crash in which passengers died with the plane. Mr. Li said that aviation in all countries has insurance, but our country, being newly established, lacks it. Because the aviation company stipulates that it is not responsible for passengers' luggage, the company cannot be responsible for compensation. Because the other party demands a large amount of compensation, the company will inevitably go bankrupt. In the future, we can only rely on insurance to remedy the situation.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Takes Over the Customs Tax Collection Office</h3>
<p>▲Ren Li Tisheng as Director...Shen Fu as Deputy Director</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Tax Collection Office was previously managed by the Bank of China, but as a national tax agency, it was changed to joint management by the Central Bank and the Bank of China last year. The two banks each dispatched staff to manage the affairs and set a deadline. Now that the deadline has expired, it should be taken back and managed by the Central Bank itself. Therefore, on the day before yesterday (the 4th), Li Tisheng was appointed as the director of the office, and Shen Fu was appointed as the deputy director (stationed at the office). They have both arrived at the office to assume their duties. Yesterday, they met with the staff and encouraged them to continue working as usual. It is also heard that more than ten new staff members will be added.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province's Regulations on Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Telegraphs Request for Correction</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that on January 21 of this year, they received Decree No. 5493 from the Ministry, which forwarded the Outline of Business Tax and supplementary measures, requesting that they be circulated and notified. The telegram stated that the nine articles of the Business Tax Outline are quite inconsistent with the resolutions of the National Internal Tax Reduction Conference in July of the 17th year of the Republic of China, and the Business Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules formulated by Jiangsu Province are even more contrary to the Outline. The Federation has repeatedly received inquiries from various chambers of commerce and has been unable to answer. It is appropriate to telegraph to the Ministry, based on the intention of reducing internal taxes to save the people, to promptly correct the tax regulations formulated by Jiangsu Province, so as to relieve the suffering of Jiangsu merchants and dispel public doubts. The telegraph was signed by Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Answers Various Questions About Business Tax</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce has received inquiries from various industries regarding the business tax issue for several days. After verifying them one by one, it has replied by letter. The replies are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲Reply to the Tongshan County Chamber of Commerce: We received your letter of the 4th of this month, asking how our Chamber of Commerce expresses itself regarding the business tax matter and asking us to investigate and reply. Our Chamber of Commerce belongs to the city's scope. The business tax in our city should be implemented after being formulated by the city government. It is currently in the planning and formulation stage, and our Chamber of Commerce has been allowed to select representatives to participate in the discussion. Because our city has not suffered any losses from internal tax reduction, (internal taxes belong to national taxes, and internal tax surcharges belong to provincial taxes, so the city's finances are not affected by internal tax reduction,) and because of the relationship with the concessions, the city authorities are still carefully considering this matter, and it is not as hasty as in other provinces. As for the business tax rates set by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, they are indeed too high and have an indirect impact on our city. Therefore, various industries have organized tax rule committees to elect representatives to go to Beijing to petition, requesting that the Ministry of Finance order the two provinces to handle the matter in accordance with the outline. The Church has also repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to repeatedly state this matter, and the texts of the telegrams are published in various newspapers at any time. We hope you have read them.</p>
<p>▲Reply to the Tea Industry Association: We received your letter of the 4th of this month, asking what percentage of the business tax the various provinces have set for the tea industry and asking us to investigate and inform you. According to reports, the business tax rates in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces combine tea and lacquer into one category called tea and lacquer tax, with a tax rate of 5 per mille. The tea industry in the E province is established as a separate category and the tax rate is 2.5 per mille. We are sending this letter in response, hoping you will take note.</p>
<p>▲Reply to the Cosmetics Association: We received your letter of the 4th of this month, stating that the collection of business tax on cosmetics should be classified in detail according to the trademark classification method and should not be generally regarded as luxury goods. We have forwarded it to the ministry and province for adoption. The business tax is based on the industry as the unit, not on goods as the unit, such as customs duties, internal taxes, and consumption taxes. The Ministry of Finance has recently telegraphed this matter to various provinces, urging them to correct it. Therefore, your letter's proposal to further classify according to the detailed rules of goods in one industry violates the principles of business tax and the Ministry's telegram. However, we find that the business tax rates in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces list luxury goods and levy a business tax of 20 per mille. Those whose nature cannot be purely regarded as luxury goods, such as the Western medicine industry, are similar to your industry's situation. Our association is planning to organize a special committee to conduct a detailed study in order to compile a case and plan for remedies. We will wait until the overall plan is handled.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Japan Passes Through Shanghai to the Philippines</h3>
<p>▲US Consul General Held a Grand Banquet Last Night to Welcome Him</p>
<p>US Ambassador to Japan Forbes, along with secretaries and staff, arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the Japanese Empress wheel at 3 PM yesterday afternoon. The US Consul General in Shanghai and dozens of American expatriates went to the pier to welcome him. At 8 PM last night, the US Consul General and his wife hosted a banquet at the consulate to welcome him. About a hundred guests attended, and the banquet did not end until after 10 PM. Ambassador Forbes and his party are scheduled to take the original wheel to Hong Kong this morning and then transfer to Manila.</p>
<h3>Chen Shaokuan Returned to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, the acting Minister of the Navy, returned to Beijing by the Beijing-Shanghai night train at 11 PM last night after coming to Shanghai on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui's Injuries Inquired About Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Insomnia for Four Nights in the Hospital</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, was injured in a plane crash and has been receiving treatment at the Orthopedic Hospital for a long time. It is now learned that although Commander Xiong's injuries have improved, he has recently been suffering from insomnia for four nights. Although his right hand can hold books and newspapers to read, the bandages on his left hand and left foot have been removed, but he still cannot move them and still cannot turn over. Therefore, the date of his discharge from the hospital is still far off.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Newspapers and News Agencies Will Be Banned</h3>
<p>▲Registration Still Possible Before the 12th</p>
<p>The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters stipulates that from January 12 to February 12, within one month, the registration matters of all major and minor newspapers and news agencies in the city should be handled. Now that the deadline is approaching, those who have not registered should quickly send personnel to register, otherwise the department will, in accordance with regulations, submit a request to the Central Government to prohibit their distribution.</p>
<h3>City Propaganda Department Schedules Meeting with Bookstore Managers</h3>
<p>▲Scheduled to Be Held at 3 PM on the Afternoon of the 12th</p>
<p>The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters has scheduled a meeting with managers of bookstores in the city for 3 PM on Sunday, February 12, to report on recent events handled by the City Propaganda Department regarding cultural institutions and to have important discussions. The notifications will be sent out today.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Replacing Sleepers</h3>
<p>In order to remedy train delays and revitalize passenger transport, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration ordered six Pacific-style locomotives from the United Kingdom and has repeatedly test-driven them, inviting various Chinese and foreign circles in this city to observe and ride them. Details have been seen in previous reports. However, it is learned that the tonnage of the locomotives is heavier than the old ones, and the vibration force of the fuselage is also greater when moving. However, the sleepers currently laid on the railway are old, and the trackside spikes may loosen due to the influence of the vibration force. Therefore, the railway bureau specially purchased a large batch of sleepers from the United Kingdom and started construction at the beginning of the month, replacing them in sections. Once the replacement is completed, the new locomotives can be put into use. Last night, the railway administration specially tested the locomotives on the sections where the sleepers have been replaced.</p>
<h3>Dr. Wu Lien-teh's Anti-Smoking Proposal</h3>
<p>The Kwok Man Press reports that Dr. Wu Lien-teh, the Chinese representative at the 1911 League of Nations Opium Conference, recently authored an article titled "The Opium Problem, a Deeply Pernicious Influence," in which he expressed his anti-smoking views. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The problem of opium (and narcotics) has now become widespread globally, reaching an extreme point. Before 1907, it was commonly believed that only the Chinese people were addicted to this vice. Therefore, the laws concerning narcotics enacted by countries such as Britain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Japan, France, and their colonies were often lenient, but harshly criticized the Chinese people's indulgence in this harmful drug that everyone knew about. After the European War, Western countries have realized that this kind of narcotic poison has spread and infiltrated into countries claiming to be clean and upright. This is because occasional mental stimulation, temporary physical pain, casual entertainment, lingering affection between the sexes, Buddhist tranquility, and physical fatigue are all enough to lure people into becoming inseparable companions with this thing. Moreover, indulging in singing and dancing venues, indulging in pleasure late into the night, almost forgetting the east and its fish, and competing for extravagance and licentiousness, neglecting their duties, are even more likely to cause people to fall into the abyss, which is mostly in the black market. Now, let us first discuss China's recent opium problem. Since China and Britain concluded the ten-year treaty, stipulating that opium trade should be gradually reduced within the period to achieve the purpose of prohibition, the opium produced within China previously amounted to at least 400,000 piculs (each picul equals 133 pounds in British weight), half of which was produced in Sichuan and Shanxi provinces, and the rest came from India, in thousands of boxes per year (each box weighs 133 pounds), all subject to heavy taxes. However, less than three years after the signing of the treaty, thanks to the strict prohibition efforts of Governor-General Zhao Erxun and his brothers, all the fields for growing poppies were swept away. The farmers all obeyed the order to switch to growing wheat and cotton. But at this time, opium was still imported, mostly from India via Yunnan, Taiwan, Qingdao, and the Manchurian border, smuggled into the country. In 1911, the Republic of China was established. Later, in order to raise funds easily, President Yuan Shikai and warlords who held their own armies did not hesitate to relax the ban on smoking. As a result, poppy seedlings reappeared throughout the country, and they even imposed taxes in the name of collecting taxes, ignoring the public opinion against drugs, thus delaying until now for nearly 20 years, the opium ban has almost become a bubble. At the same time, school textbooks all painfully describe the harm of opium, but they are all regarded as mere formalities. The situation is similar to that before 1900. Up to now, the amount of opium produced nationwide is no less than 200,000 piculs, almost equal to half the amount of opium before the Sino-British treaty in 1907. The opium trade is protected by warlords, and the opium-producing areas are very wide. The estimated annual profit is at least 50 million to 100 million taels. However, the government has never obtained any tax revenue from this, and it is all pocketed by the operators and those who provide protection, which is a great shame to the international community. Some may ask, is there really no solution to save this situation? Or will the most practical methods based on experience be used to cater to the national anti-drug policy announced, and the huge sums of money previously pocketed by powerful people be returned to the central treasury, turning private gains into public benefits, achieving a win-win strategy? I believe that we are not necessarily at a loss. Based on my many years of heartbreaking experience, I offer some humble opinions as follows. Whether they are appropriate or not, I hope those who care about opium administration will carefully consider them: (1) The central authorities should immediately convene a concrete meeting of leaders from the industrial and scientific communities by the anti-smoking bureau established by the government to determine fundamental methods and eliminate the danger of opium poisoning; (2) Begin an accurate survey of the number of mu of poppy cultivation in each province, so that the authorities can base it on the anti-smoking policy; (3) Aim to completely ban the trade of drugs within fifteen years. During this period, the government should strictly supervise the opium produced domestically, especially paying attention to the ports and cities where raw opium enters and exits; (4) Hire experienced customs officials to handle tax collection matters. Assuming that each picul is taxed at 2,000 taels of silver, this amount should be stored separately and not mixed with other tax revenues, so that this amount can be used to handle anti-smoking affairs, so that it is not necessary to consume national currency or raise funds separately; (5) At least 10% of the total amount of this tax revenue must be used to set up smoking cessation centers, public hospitals, and other recurring expenses in various key ports, so as to help people quit smoking on the one hand, and handle anti-drug and health propaganda on the other; (6) It is necessary to carry out the above-mentioned points at the same time, strictly controlling the amount of opium planted and consumed, reducing it by 1/15 each year, so that the opium fields and opium farmers in each province can gradually reduce and eliminate opium poison according to the government's anti-smoking policy, so as to avoid difficult situations; (7) At the beginning of the implementation of the ban, it seems inappropriate to be too concerned or have complicated procedures, such as opium addicts obtaining licenses and taking photos. This procedure not only consumes a lot of administrative expenses, but also easily opens up loopholes, and it is not welcomed by those who quit smoking; (8) Some may say that the government has now clearly banned smoking, so why allow people to smoke again? Isn't this a contradiction and ridicule? In fact, it is not. Gradually correcting past mistakes is better than delaying. The United States is rich and powerful, with a perfect organization, and its population is only a quarter of China's. It has not been able to find a good solution to the alcohol prohibition problem, which can be used as a lesson. Now, let us discuss the problem of pure narcotics, such as cocaine and various opium derivatives, and the refining of other counterfeit alkaline compounds. In recent years, countries around the world have paid more attention to the harm of morphine (and cocaine) than to the opium problem. I had already considered this in 1919, and now it has invaded various countries, especially spreading rapidly in developed countries, just like the influenza epidemic, raging in civilized countries. Twenty years ago, there were only a handful of manufacturers of morphine and other narcotics, but today there are more than 140 commercial firms openly selling this harmful compound, as far as my records show. The one that has been operating for a short time but producing the most is Turkey. According to the latest report received by the League of Nations, Turkey exports 5,200 kilograms of morphine and 8,650 kilograms of heroin every year. This means that the Turkey of this new era is now manufacturing half of the world's morphine needs (a total of 12,000 kilograms) and more than the total amount of heroin the world needs (a total of 8,650 kilograms). Truly, Turkey is good at learning from advanced Europe. Recently, many fashionable young people often carry narcotics with them as a way to refresh themselves. Since the European War, the morality of commerce and professional occupations has been declining, so the sales of narcotics have been increasing day by day, and the traces of private sellers are all over the country. In major ports such as San Francisco, New York, Singapore, Yangon, Shanghai, Otsu, Hong Kong, and Marseille, large quantities of private drugs are often seized, which is enough to prove the high profits of this illegal trade, so many people flock to it. Other famous actresses, movie stars, doctors in various departments, and seemingly decent businessmen, wealthy people of unknown origin, etc., are also trading in this for profit and becoming victims of narcotics. League of Nations personnel are thinking about eliminating this evil, but they don't know what to do. This is also the retribution that European countries are eating. They thought that this drug only affected degenerate nations, and they could take advantage of it to suck their fat, lighten their burden, and hope to reap its benefits. Since the signing of the Hague Convention in 1912, all countries have agreed to ban narcotics, but year after year, all countries have regarded it as insignificant and remained silent. This is why the representatives of China and Thailand refused to sign the 1925 treaty and left the Geneva conference. The problem of narcotics is complicated and difficult. It is necessary to start early, which is not comparable to the arms reduction problem. If all countries can enthusiastically engage in it, it is not difficult to reach a fair solution. I have also made some suggestions in this regard. Fortunately, Mr. Wu Kaisheng, the representative of our country, has also made proposals at the Geneva conference. Generally, it is proposed to establish a general narcotics manufacturing plant at the location of the League of Nations and send personnel to supervise the manufacture of counterfeit alkaline compounds legally needed for medical purposes around the world. The manufacturing plants in other countries should be closed immediately. The quantity of their manufacture can be based on the number of 450 mg per person in developed medical countries determined by League of Nations experts. The factory can also be the official agency of the general administration for allocating and selling these narcotics to factories that have already been established (the fewer the types, the better). This agency can allocate them to the personnel officially appointed by each country's government to avoid abuses. A research department should also be established to conduct physiological and chemical tests on addictive drugs in order to gradually improve and achieve the goal of completely eliminating bad habits. The reasons for opposing the League of Nations' supervision of manufacturing are twofold: (1) The investment issues of countries that have always manufactured narcotics. However, if this issue involves armaments and equipment, it is indeed important and difficult to resolve. The manufacture of narcotics is a relatively new business, and it is not difficult to negotiate a liquidation method with the governments concerned. (2) The issue of national tranquility in wartime. During wartime, the medical needs for narcotics increase sharply. If they are supplied from abroad, it is not as convenient as making and using them themselves. However, this matter is not important. Once the war starts, necessities such as gasoline, kerosene, and food are even more important than narcotics. In short, the League of Nations is a detached international organization, and there will be no abuses if it supervises the manufacturing. I hope that the authorities in various countries who are blinded by the profits of narcotics will think twice and not endanger the future of world peace for their own selfish interests. Readers may think that my suggestions are revolutionary, but now is the era of creation. All scholars who are responsible for seeking world happiness should consider any reasonable plan to achieve this goal.</p>

<h3>Abolition of Change Fractions in Commercial Transactions</h3>
<p>▲ The Money Trade Association Has Already Announced</p>
<p>The financial community proposed to abolish the change fractions of silver dollars in and out and to use fractions as the unit. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is understood that the Money Trade Association has announced the implementation of this matter, roughly saying that it was decided at the regular meeting on February 2nd of this year that the industry should use "li" as the unit for receiving and paying silver and silver dollars. Now, in order to facilitate calculation, the rounding method is used, and starting from February 16th of this year, all receipts and payments, whether silver or silver dollars, will be in units of "fen". Correspondingly, the record is notified, and you are requested to check and handle it. Yesterday's newspaper reported that it would start on February 19th, but the notice states that it would start on February 16th, because the 17th and 18th were the days when the silver and money industry settled the accounts for the 19th year and took a slight break.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<h3>During the Account Closing Period, All Drafts Must Be Payable on Demand</h3>
<p>For the convenience of commercial circulation of funds, money shops have long-term drafts with a ten-day term to replace cash. All commercial transactions are used as cash. Now that the money shop is in the period of closing the account for the 19th year, if long-term drafts are used again, they must be mixed with the business of the 20th year. In order to clearly define the boundaries, the committee has resolved that all merchants who want to issue drafts after February 15th should be limited to on-demand drafts and not issue long-term drafts. After this account closing period (that is, February 19th), the old rules will still be followed.</p>
<h3>The Xin Kang Disaster Association is Actively Proceeding</h3>
<p>▲ Eight Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>The Xin Kang Steamboat Disaster Family Association held a committee meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the implementation methods. First, Committee Member Zhu reported that the negotiations with Japan on this case had not yielded results due to diplomatic methods, and there were many difficulties in the litigation process, resulting in the case being suspended for two years without a solution. The pain and reflection were inexplicable, and the indignation was unexplainable. Please discuss how to proceed. After the committee members successively expressed their opinions, they all said that the association should proceed with two points, internal and external. Externally, it should seek a quick resolution of the negotiations, and internally, it should seek the safety of the families. The colleagues of the association should work hard based on these two points and never give up. Secondly, it was resolved: (1) To send a telegram to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that the rights of the country and the lives of the people be given priority and that serious negotiations be continued with the Japanese government, so as to ensure compensation for the loss of life and property; (2) To send a telegram to the whole country to carry out the abolition of all unequal treaties between China and Japan and to recover the right to navigate the territorial waters; (3) All committee members will go to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on a regular basis to visit Director-General Li and ask him to announce the latest progress of the company's handling of the case and the definite direction of future negotiations; (4) In addition to the original legal counsel, Attorney Sheng Zhenwei, it is proposed to hire Attorney Wu Jingxiong as the legal counsel of the association, and Zhu and Zhou are publicly recommended to contact him; (5) The issue of relief for poor families, in addition to writing to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to consider ways to solve it, each committee member will also plan separately to fulfill the friendship of helping each other in the same boat; (6) The legal counsel is still requested to act as the full agent for the litigation and proceed effectively; (7) The issue of litigation expenses and relief will be directly requested by President Yang to understand the special circumstances and approve the relief; (8) Regularly go to the Japan Mail Steamship Company to visit the president of the company, give good-faith advice, and do not cover up the truth. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>The Collision Case Between the Yi Li and Chongqing Ships</h3>
<p>▲ Arbitration Results</p>
<p>▲ Yi Li Does Not Accept</p>
<p>At 6:10 PM on March 28th of last year (the 19th year), the Yi Li ship of the Chinese Yi Li Shipping Company cast off its mooring cables from the Dada Wharf in Nanshi and set sail slowly downstream towards the Pudong side of the opposite bank. When passing the Lujiazui Water Police pontoon boat, the Chongqing ship of the British Taikoo Yangxing also approached the Pudong side and sailed upstream into the port. The Yi Li ship believed that the ship should not be sailing in this waterway, fearing a collision, and sounded its whistle once to make it pay attention to avoiding it. Unexpectedly, the ship answered with two whistles because it wanted to berth at the Pudong Wharf, indicating that it was unwilling to change course and still sailed straight towards the Yi Li ship. The Yi Li continued to sound its whistle three times, and reversed its engine and immediately dropped anchor, but the Chongqing ship also dropped anchor, but it still slammed into the Yi Li ship. At that time, the Yi Li ship was seriously injured, with repair costs estimated at more than 19,000 taels of silver. The Chongqing ship suffered only minor damage and left the port as usual. Afterwards, the Yi Li company issued a list to the Taikoo Yangxing, requesting compensation for the repair costs of more than 19,000 taels of silver, but the company refused to compensate. The Yi Li company originally intended to sue in court, but since the British consular jurisdiction in China has not yet been effectively abolished, it must file a lawsuit directly in its Shanghai court. However, according to past events, Chinese people suing foreign courts have never been able to obtain a fair judgment, so it was forced to ask the Taikoo Yangxing to ask a notary public to arbitrate and insisted on asking a person from a third country to serve as the arbitrator, but the Taikoo Yangxing still did not agree. After repeated negotiations, no results were obtained, so it was requested that the English port pilot Luo Shengzhelei (transliteration) of Songhu serve as the arbitrator. After the arbitration award was published, not only did Taikoo not compensate the Yi Li company for its losses, but it also wanted the Yi Li to compensate the Chongqing ship for repair costs of 4,000 yuan. Now the company has issued a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shipping Association, appealing to them to uphold justice and reassure our shipping industry. (Kwok Man Press)</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Representatives Visit Zhang Shouyong Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ They Expressed Their Difficulties and Hoped for the Issuance of Silk Factory Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association believes that the silk market in foreign firms is declining again, and the issuance of public bonds for the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai is taking time. Each factory needs funds for relief, which is really urgent. A general meeting was convened the day before yesterday, and it was publicly decided to recommend representatives to petition Vice Minister Zhang Cai nearby. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the recommended representatives, such as Wang Xiaolai, Shen Huachen, Chu Huiseng, Huang Jin Chen, Shi Xinsheng, Huang Jinfan, Zhang Yunsheng, Wu Shenbo, Sun Rongchang, Yu Shouchang, Xu Yunjiang, Chen Mingshan, and other eleven people (Zhu Jing'an was absent due to business), gathered at the Beijing Road Weicheng Company and took cars to the Central Bank to visit Vice Minister Zhang Cai. They were received, and representatives such as Chu Huisheng, Shen Huachen, and Wang Xiaolai successively stated the difficult situation of the silk industry and said that the failure of silk factory operations last year almost led to total bankruptcy. Afterwards, the industry associations in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai discussed and submitted a request to the government to issue public bonds for relief. Chairman Chiang and Ministers Song and Kong of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry approved the issuance. Your Minister, the director in charge, came to Shanghai and convened a meeting of industry representatives to decide to issue 7 million yuan of public bonds, with 1 million yuan (later added another 1 million yuan) for improving sericulture and 6 million yuan for relieving silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. The Executive Yuan, etc., have been requested to issue the bonds and are on file. Later, when the price of gold soared and the exchange rate fell, the sale of factory silk in Europe suddenly started, and Japanese merchants started buying to replenish their supplies. The market price of B-grade silk rose to more than 1,000 taels. The financial community believed that the issuance of public bonds was imminent and that they would be offset by something, so they lent the dried cocoons they had received as collateral to the factories to help them start work. Those who tried to start work in the past month only accounted for one-tenth of the total. However, it was a flash in the pan, and the sale of silk in Europe became sluggish again. The price of yarn fell sharply by more than 100 taels. According to the current cost of factory yarn, it cannot be maintained unless the price of silk reaches 1,300 taels. It is still necessary to lose more than 300 taels of silver per bale. Moreover, the account closing period is approaching, and the industry needs funds for turnover urgently. If the public bonds are not issued immediately, the silk factories that have not started will have no hope of recovery, and those that have started will also be unable to support themselves. The trend is getting worse day by day, and the environment is getting more dangerous day by day. It is necessary to announce the silk factory public bond case as soon as possible to save the situation and provide funds for regulation. Vice Minister Zhang said that the Ministry of Finance has completed all issuance procedures and is only waiting for the Executive Yuan to reply. Now it is only a matter of time. Since the silk industry is so urgent, he will try to forward the request to the Executive Yuan and announce it as soon as possible. First, a committee will be organized to handle registration matters, and the organizational regulations will be drafted by himself tomorrow and announced together with the Ministry of Industry. The representatives expressed their gratitude to Vice Minister Zhang and left.</p>
<h3>Datong Music Society Rushes to Practice Six Chapters of Zhonghe Shao Music</h3>
<p>▲ New Musical Instruments are Used for the Completion Ceremony</p>
<p>The Shanghai Datong Music Society has completed the construction of a complete set of ancient and modern musical instruments. The appearance is exquisite, and the content can be coordinated. It is planned to hold a completion ceremony in the near future, using all the newly built classical musical instruments to play Zhonghe Shao music, a total of six chapters: (1) Chapter of Taihe, (2) Chapter of Baohe, (3) Chapter of Xiehe, (4) Chapter of Xuanhe, (5) Chapter of Pinghe, (6) Chapter of Gonghe. Shao music was composed by Emperor Shun 4,000 years ago. Confucius called it perfect. Wu Jizha was amazed after watching the music. Qin Shihuang burned books and buried scholars alive, changing the established practices of the three dynasties. All kinds of music were abolished, but Shao music was specially preserved, which is enough to show the value of Shao music. From the Han Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, the country used it for sacrifices to heaven and ancestors, and it was never changed. It is the origin of Chinese culture and the foundation of music, and it is the most credible of ancient music. Recently, in order to seek a fundamental solution, the association convened all the members of the large orchestra and worked hard to practice. The results have been very impressive. It is like entering a grand hall, as if in the bright sunshine, gentle breeze, and sweet rain, a scene of phoenixes singing and a dignified atmosphere, which makes people feel awed, leisurely thinking, and looking up high. Unknowingly, it reveals its inherent national character. At the beginning of the current hall, it is only a small part of the musical work, and the results have been very satisfactory. In the future, if we add banners, songs, and dances, and set up complete equipment, the results will be even more incredible.</p>
<h3>Japanese Textile Merchants Establishing Factories in China</h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Merchants Intensifying Competition</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Merchants Experiencing Increased Pressure</p>
<p>Since the price of gold became high and silver became low, and with our country increasing import tariffs to protect domestic goods, the import of foreign goods has become disadvantageous. Japanese textile merchants are therefore investing heavily in establishing and expanding textile factories in Shanghai to avoid high taxes, take advantage of opportunities, and compete with Chinese and foreign counterparts. Currently, the four largest Japanese firms are all adding buildings, increasing the number of spindles and automatic looms to produce finer fabrics, aiming to gain an advantage in the market. Previously, among Japanese factories, only Donghua used automatic looms; now, Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 9 is adding a total of 1,000 automatic looms, and Shanghai Textile Company's five factories are adding a total of 750. In addition, Yufeng added 30,000 spindles last winter and is now adding another 30,000. Taikang is also adding 20,000 spindles, and both factories have plans to add weaving mills and purchase automatic looms. With the looms of Shanghai Textile and Nei Wai Cotton Mill both scheduled to be installed within six weeks, once production begins, while foreign merchants selling high-quality cotton textiles may not be greatly affected, those selling lower-quality textiles will face a stronger competitor, and China's cotton textile industry, still in its infancy, will inevitably experience even greater pressure.</p>
<h3>Report from Weishi County on Suffering from the Calamities of War</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from Zhang Fang, Chairman of the Henan Relief Commission, stating: "To the esteemed Chinese Red Cross Society, I have received a report from Yang Xuyi, Magistrate of Weishi County, stating that Weishi County has many ravines and the people are poor. The harvest of the two wheat crops was poor, and they were already suffering from hunger and distress when a large number of rebel troops came north and stationed in the cities and villages. They levied funds, vehicles, firewood, and grass, and extorted from wealthy households by exchanging worthless currency, demanding salt money, and levying tobacco taxes, intensifying their oppression. The most difficult and concerning matter is the conscription of soldiers, with each village required to provide over a hundred men, each man requiring a hiring fee of over a hundred yuan. Any delay in meeting the deadline resulted in severe beatings. The total burden over several months amounted to no less than seven million yuan. During the major battle, the artillery fire was deafening, and the cries of anguish shook the fields, a scene too terrible to bear. The back-and-forth trampling ruined homes and shelters. Now, with the arrival of winter, they are exposed to the wind and sleep in the open. I earnestly request assistance and relief. After reviewing the report, the facts are confirmed. Please provide assistance quickly. Zhang Fang, Relief Commission, respectfully requests."</p>
<h3>The Nisshin Kinzan Maru Runs Aground and Sinks off Shantou</h3>
<p>▲ The Hull is Completely Damaged and Impossible to Salvage</p>
<p>▲ Crew and Comprador Expected to Arrive Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Nisshin Company's Kinzan Maru, carrying mixed grains to Nanhua, ran aground off Shantou. The ship is stuck on the reef and cannot be salvaged. The loss, including cargo, is at least 200,000 yuan. The circumstances of this incident, as investigated and reported by reporters from various sources, are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Circumstances of the grounding: The Kinzan Maru, fully loaded with soybeans, was en route to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou to unload its cargo. At 9:40 PM on the 2nd of this month, the ship was about 90 nautical miles off the coast of Shantou. At that time, fog had descended. The captain of the Kinzan Maru intended to arrive in Shantou that night so that the cargo could be unloaded on the 3rd, avoiding any delay in the schedule. Furthermore, this route was familiar to them, and they anticipated no accidents. Therefore, they proceeded in the fog. Unexpectedly, the direction of the channel was obscured by the fog, and the ship ran aground on a submerged reef at 9:45 PM. The bottom of the ship became lodged on the rocks.</p>
<p>▲ Flooding of each hold: The front hold of the Kinzan Maru was breached by the reef, and seawater rushed in. Within moments, the water in the cargo hold reached three feet. Ten minutes later, the second hold also began to flood. It was then discovered that seawater was also entering the engine room. All the lights on the ship went out, and the crew and sailors were terrified, preparing life jackets and rafts to escape. Fortunately, the bottom of the ship was held by the reef, preventing it from immediately sinking, but the water had already reached the main deck.</p>
<p>▲ Naval Rescue: After the accident, the captain urgently sent an SOS wireless signal and set off flares to request assistance. The first to receive the signal was the Japanese destroyer "Take" from Fuzhou, which immediately set sail in the fog to rescue the Kinzan Maru off the coast of Shantou. Upon arriving at the scene, the destroyer did not dare to approach too closely and communicated via wireless radio. At the same time, the "Take" relayed a message to the Nisshin branch in Shantou, ordering them to quickly transport food and other supplies to assist. The "Take" then assumed responsibility for protecting the area to prevent piracy. The Nisshin Shantou branch, upon receiving the report, urgently arranged for the Shanghai-Guangdong liner Songshan Maru, which was returning to Shanghai from Shantou, to load a large quantity of food, fresh water, and rescue supplies and set sail for the scene of the accident. The Songshan Maru launched small motorboats and sampans to deliver the supplies to the Kinzan Maru for the crew and sailors to eat.</p>
<p>▲ Crew Rescue: Since there was no hope of salvaging the Kinzan Maru at that time, the crew prepared to abandon ship. After discussion, the Kinzan and Songshan Maru jointly telegraphed the Shanghai office for instructions. As a result, the company granted approval for the Songshan Maru to rescue the crew, including the comprador Chen Changhua and the accounting staff, and transport them back to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Shanghai office received another telegram stating that the Songshan Maru had left Shantou with the rescued comprador and crew and was expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ Cargo to be Abandoned: Currently, the Kinzan Maru is grounded on the reef. Although it has not completely sunk, the hole in the bottom of the ship is widening, and the middle hold is also damaged. All the cargo holds are flooded with seawater. The ship has a carrying capacity of 1,710 tons and is loaded with over 10,000 bags of soybeans, which will likely be completely abandoned. However, the company still hopes to salvage some of the cargo on the deck. Therefore, in addition to the captain, a dozen sailors have been left on board to guard the ship and wait for the arrival of tugboats and barges to attempt to unload the cargo on the deck. The Japanese destroyer "Take" is temporarily providing food and protection to the remaining crew.</p>
<p>▲ Repelling Pirates: Pirates are rampant in the waters off Shantou. After the Kinzan Maru ran aground, a group of pirates attempted to rob the ship but were repelled by the Japanese destroyer. The Kinzan Maru was originally a ship of the Osaka Company and was purchased by Nisshin last year for use in expanding its North and South Pacific round-trip liner service. The accident, including the ship, cargo, and crew's luggage, is expected to result in a loss of 260,000 to 270,000 yuan. Fortunately, the ship was not carrying passengers, so there was no loss of life.</p>
<h3>Ship Accidents in Heavy Fog</h3>
<p>▲ British and Greek Ships Collide</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Ship Runs Aground</p>
<p>▲ Two Ships Damaged: The heavy fog outside Wusongkou lasted for two days. It was not until 3 PM on the afternoon of the fourth that ships began to enter the port one after another. Yesterday, outside Wusongkou at Sanjiashuikou, the Blue Funnel Line's SS Euryades set sail for Shanghai as the fog cleared. As it was sailing, the Norwegian ship Lysefjord, which was carrying water from Shanghai to Wusong to supply a certain ship, approached. At that time, the fog had not completely cleared, and the sea was not very clear. When the two ships drew near, they were unable to avoid each other and collided. The British ship and the Norwegian ship each suffered damage to their hulls, with the damage on both sides being very significant. They entered the port around 5 PM and have reported the incident to the Harbor Bureau for inspection. They will then enter the dock for repairs and discuss the issue of responsibility.</p>
<p>▲ Rokkaku Maru Runs Aground: The Nippon Yusen Kaisha's Rokkaku Maru, sailing from Yokohama to Shanghai, was carrying over 1,000 tons of cargo and about 20 Chinese passengers. On the morning of the fourth, when the ship was about three nautical miles outside the port of Moji, it encountered heavy fog. At that time, the sea lanes were obscured and unrecognizable. The Rokkaku Maru mistakenly sailed onto a submerged reef, and the ship became stuck. The passengers were terrified. Fortunately, the hull was not pierced. The captain immediately telegraphed the head office for help. After eight hours, the NYK dispatched the large steamer Shire to Moji to pull the Rokkaku Maru off the reef and tow it back to the Moji port wharf. Divers inspected the ship and found that the bottom of the hull had been scratched by the reef during the rescue and was unable to sail. It was then decided that the cargo on the Rokkaku Maru would be transferred to the Mikasa Maru, and the passengers would disembark in Moji and transfer to the Mikasa Maru to Shanghai. The Rokkaku Maru was scheduled to enter the port today, but due to the grounding and repairs, it is unable to sail to Shanghai. The Mikasa Maru, which is carrying the cargo and passengers, is not expected to enter the port until the ninth. The company has already notified all passengers.</p>
<h3>Two Letters Regarding the RiYa Bank</h3>
<p>Accountant Xu Yongzuo sent two letters to accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang yesterday, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Shareholder List: "To the esteemed sirs, I have received your letter stating that Yuan Ludeng claims that the company's stock certificate templates and shareholder list were taken by Accountant Xu Yongzuo, and requesting that they be immediately returned for review and reporting. I hereby reply that while I briefly saw these stock certificate templates and shareholder list when I was present at the Rehabilitation Committee, I did not keep them in my possession. I am replying to your letter accordingly. I hope you will investigate. Sincerely, Xu Yongzuo, Accountant. To Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang, Accountants."</p>
<p>▲ Registration Issue: "To the esteemed sirs, on the afternoon of the third of this month, I received your letter requesting the transfer of the Shanghai RiYa Bank and Great World Deposit and Tour Department creditor registration documents handled by me. I replied that 'these documents are not the property of the bank or the department and were not within the scope of the receivership entrusted to your accountants on the 27th of last month. Therefore, when I relinquished my liquidation duties, I transferred these documents to the original trustee, the Rehabilitation Committee.' Today (the fifth), I read your advertisement in the newspaper stating that 'creditors who previously registered with Accountant Xu are now requested to come and register with their certificates because Accountant Xu has not transferred the documents, making it impossible to review them.' The advertisement was submitted yesterday, only one day after your letter requesting the transfer of documents. Moreover, registering creditors is not a particularly urgent or pressing procedure. It seems appropriate to wait for the Rehabilitation Committee to transfer the documents. After reviewing the records, I handled registrations for approximately 8,000 households, accounting for two-thirds of all creditors. Among them, there are many women, children, and people who have traveled far to Shanghai. Initially, there were thousands of people every day, vying to register and crowding together, a sight that was heartbreaking. To order these 8,000 households to re-register, considering their circumstances, would be unbearable. Because I have previously handled this case and have a friendly relationship with you, I venture to respectfully submit this letter, hoping that you will consider the public good and the suffering of the majority of creditors, temporarily waive the re-registration to show consideration. The 8,000 creditors will be truly grateful. Sincerely, Xu Yongzuo, Accountant. To Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang, Accountants."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Sets the Date for the Re-election of Foreign Directors</h3>

<h3>After the Resolution of the Dispute at the New Ba Xian Qiao Market</h3>
<p>▲ All Stallholders Have Moved in and Are Doing Business</p>
<p>The Ba Xian Qiao Market in the French Concession was demolished and rebuilt by the French Municipal Council last spring. During the construction, stalls were temporarily set up in front of the Sino-French School on Route Ghisi Minisini. After more than a year, the new market was completed last month. The Municipal Council announced that it would use a bidding method, which was opposed by all the vendors, so they did not move in. Subsequently, the Chinese Taxpayers Association and Chinese Director Du intervened in mediation, and both sides reached a satisfactory resolution. The Municipal Council notified all the stallholders yesterday, setting tomorrow (the 7th) as the date for all of them to move in and do business. It is reported that the vendors are preparing to move and set up their stalls on schedule.</p>
<h3>Mr. David H. Gray Speaks at the Rotary Club Yesterday</h3>
<p>The local Rotary Club held a grand and enthusiastic luncheon yesterday. During the event, the club president introduced Mr. David H. Gray, a special representative of Rotary International, who delivered a speech. He began by expressing his gratitude, saying that he felt honored to speak at the Rotary Club in China, which was the first to be established and had the most international members. The organization of Rotary Clubs is widespread throughout the world and is showing substantial progress. Notable achievements have been made by those established in Little Luzon, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, Dalian, Liaoning, and Harbin. In Chile, the first Rotary Club was only officially established four years ago, and now there are more than forty. In Yugoslavia, the organization only existed three years ago, and now there are twenty-five established. The United Kingdom has 350 Rotary Clubs, and London alone has 55. In total, there are currently over 3,200 Rotary Clubs with 154,000 members from 70 countries. In Canada, every city with a population of over 2,000 has a Rotary Club, totaling over 110. He also said that if the Rotary Club did not have its own true value, then these 154,000 outstanding individuals from various countries around the world would not be able to join. Major European countries each have established Rotary Clubs, and South America and North America are also making great efforts. Northern China, Japan, Java, and other places are all making significant progress. From this, it can be seen that the world's major cities are all striving to organize and carry out Rotary Club activities. The greatest purpose of the Rotary Club is that its members must be loyal citizens. There is no place in the Rotary Club for those who do not love their country, because the Rotary Club firmly believes that only those who can truly serve their country are qualified to speak of racial and international friendship. This kind of friendship cannot be achieved through conditions or the rhetoric of diplomats. It is necessary for people around the world to embrace friendship and use this as a guide to interact with each other in order to achieve this goal. The Rotary Club, in view of this, stipulates that all members can attend Rotary Club meetings anywhere. For this reason, 150,000 Rotary Club members from 70 countries have the possibility of close connections at any time. We firmly believe that if you love one person, you will love the country of that person. I remember four years ago, I saw over 9,000 Rotary Club members from 30 countries gathered together for five or six days. What were the good results of such a gathering? The organization of the Rotary Club is international in nature, as can be proven by the selection of successive presidents. From 1928 to 1929, the president was a Mexican, a Catholic. The first vice president was a Scotsman, a Christian. The second vice president was from the United States, and the third was from Chile. These people meet several times a year. The Rotary Club is not a secret organization. Members can invite local or foreign guests to attend at any time, and the club is very considerate of members' actions. The Rotary Club has no religious affiliation. All religions are treated equally and welcomed. It is worth mentioning that the Rotary Club is neither a commercial organization nor is it established to promote the personal business interests of its members. In short, the Rotary Club is a society that brings together the upper echelons of various countries around the world to strive to promote mutual understanding and goodwill and international peace.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Health Bureau Opens a Medical and Health Consultation Section</h3>
<p>To facilitate citizens' consultations on medical and health matters, the Municipal Health Bureau has established a medical and health consultation section attached to the First Department. Any citizen who has doubts about medical and health matters and is unable to determine a self-defense plan can submit a written request to the Health Bureau for guidance. The length of the response time will be determined based on the complexity of the consultation. The scope of the response will be a general answer within the possible scope of the matters described in the written request of the consultant. The implementation of matters such as disease diagnosis and medication should still be guided by a physician.

<p>▲ Those Exceeding the Deadline Will be Buried on the Spot</p>
<p>▲ Proclamation: The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and Public Security Bureau proclaim, for the purpose of proclamation: "After investigation, the floating graves in the city are densely packed, and most of the coffins are thin and have been exposed for a long time, which is a major impediment to public health.

<h3>Tenants of Shoufu Lane on Vegetable Market Road Oppose Rent Increases</h3>
<p>The houses in Shoufu Lane on Vegetable Market Road in the French Concession, totaling more than a hundred buildings, were previously leased by the Italian Bank. In January of this year, the bank transferred the leasing business to Yong'an Real Estate Company. The company immediately notified all tenants that they must sign new lease contracts with the company within ten days of receiving the letter and increase the rent by 70% of the original amount. Otherwise, they would be required to vacate the premises within the specified period. All the tenants were panicked and gathered on the evening of the previous day at Dongyu Elementary School in the lane to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures. All the tenants unanimously elected Yang Zhengyong as chairman, who reported on the landlord's letter requiring them to sign new leases and increase the rent by a certain percentage. Next, the 19 articles of the lease contract were read out. All the tenants were very angry and felt that the contents of the contract, such as the pre-payment of a deposit (i.e., small rent) and other various clauses, were extremely harsh. If they agreed, the tenants would have no place to live in peace. They unanimously expressed their opposition. The following methods were then resolved: (1) To organize a tenants' union as a collective countermeasure. (2) Yang Zhengyong, Chen Bangru, Sun Jianqing, Zhang Jieqing, Sun Youliang, Chen Keming, Chen Longfang, Zhu Runqing, Zhu Shifang, Wang Kunshan, and Ling Rongrong were unanimously elected as representatives to be responsible for handling all negotiations. (3) Yang Zhengyong was mutually elected as the chief representative. (4) All unanimously refused to sign the lease contract. (5) First, the tenants' union would send a letter to the landlord stating that the contract was very harsh and difficult to accept, and requesting its automatic withdrawal. (6) All rejected the rent increase. (7) In the event that the landlords forced them to sign the contract and implement the rent increase, they would unanimously refuse and deposit all the rent in the bank as a basis for negotiation. (8) The contents of the landlord's coercive contract and the situation of the huge rent increase would be submitted to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Rent Review Committee, and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession to uphold justice and provide assistance. (9) If necessary, lawyers would be hired to protect them according to the law. (10) All expenses would be shared jointly by all. After unanimous approval, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Da Gu Road Foreign Customs Lane: Bandits Continuously Rob Five Families</h3>
<p>Police Station Receives Report, Sends Large Force to Arrest</p>
<p>Both Sides Confront, Bullets Fly</p>
<p>One Bandit Killed, Three Bandits Wounded</p>
<p>More Than Ten Additional People Arrested Subsequently</p>
<p>▲ A Chinese Officer Wounded, No Major Injury</p>
<p>At number 1175 Chengqi Lane, Dagu Road, around 9 PM last night, approximately eight or nine bandits entered and robbed multiple homes. Starting from the eastern厢房 (wing room) upstairs and going to the亭子间 (attic room), they robbed a total of five families. The total losses are estimated to be quite significant. The bandits carried away the stolen goods and attempted to escape, but before they left the lane, the local Lao Zha police station received the report and dispatched Chinese and foreign armed detectives to patrol the area. The bandits fled into neighboring houses and opened fire to resist arrest. The police officers returned fire immediately. For a time, the sound of gunfire was constant, like a string of pearls. One bandit was killed on the spot, and three were wounded and captured.</p>
<p>▲ Entire Building Searched, No One Spared West Tibet Road, Dagu Road, Foreign Customs Lane, Chengqi Lane, number 1175. The ground floor is the Zhou Yuanxing tailor shop. Last night at 8:50 PM, seven bandits suddenly staged a robbery. Two bandits stood guard at the front door. After the remaining bandits entered the shop, they brandished handguns, showing them to the workers in the shop to intimidate them into silence. Then, they swarmed upstairs. The tailor shop upstairs had five or six households living there, residing in the main room, eastern and western wing rooms, and the attic, etc. After the bandits went upstairs, four bandits first entered the Zhang family’s eastern wing room. They used searching for stolen goods as an excuse to barge into the room. They then showed their handguns, ordering them not to shout. They opened the boxes and drawers in the room, taking away fox fur coats and ornaments, worth over a thousand yuan. While the four bandits were robbing the eastern wing room, the remaining bandits also worked simultaneously, going to the Ni family in the front building and the Zhang family in the western wing room to rob them. Afterward, the bandits went to the attic room and the back building, opening boxes and overturning baskets, searching everywhere. Countless clothes and jewelry were stolen.</p>
<p>▲ Escaping into Neighboring Houses, Opening Fire to Resist Arrest After the bandits finished robbing, they carried the stolen goods and prepared to go downstairs as a group. Before leaving, they ordered the victims to open the door to see them off, in order to dispel suspicion. The last bandit to leave even took the lock of the main door to prevent the people inside from chasing after them. However, the victims, seeing the bandits leaving, immediately blew whistles at the top of the stairs. The neighbors, hearing the news, also reported to the police station by telephone. Meanwhile, one of the victims ran from the back door to the street and informed the police officer on duty. The bandits, hearing the sound of whistles and shouts, panicked and hurriedly fled into number 1176, a 石庫門 (Shikumen) house to the right of number 1175. The main room of this house also served as a tailor shop, named Zhu Changfa. The shop had many employees who were working. They saw a group of people with anxious expressions suddenly enter through the main door, carrying clothing bundles, and heading straight for the kitchen. They were about to inquire when gunfire erupted. The large police force had already arrived after hearing the news, and the bandits knew things were bad and opened fire to resist arrest. Gunfire Constant, One Dead, Three Wounded After the Lao Zha police station received the news of a large group of bandits staging a robbery, they immediately dispatched armed detectives to patrol the area. The bandits who had fled into number 1176 were now turning back and fleeing for their lives. Except for a few bandits who escaped through the back door, the remaining four bandits were unable to escape and had to open fire in a desperate battle. At the time, the sound of gunfire was constant. Those who didn't know the situation would have thought it was a celebration at the end of the lunar year to thank the gods. Because the bandits were outnumbered, they were shot and fell to the ground. One bandit died on the spot in the lane due to severe injuries. The other three were shot in vital areas and lost their ability to fight. They were all arrested. The wounded were sent to the Public Works Bureau Hospital for treatment and interrogation. The bandit who was shot and killed was not very tall. He was lying at the bottom of the lane against the wall. There were several large patches of blood, shockingly red. Looking up at the wall, there were the words "Wang Deyan's Civil and Military Magic." One could not help but feel saddened for a long time.</p>
<p>▲ Police Station Makes Efforts to Arrest Accomplices The detectives from the Lao Zha police station took the three bandits arrested on the spot back for treatment and interrogation. They revealed the whereabouts of their accomplices, and the police immediately went out to arrest them. By midnight, more than ten people had been arrested. Therefore, it will not be difficult to arrest the remaining bandits one by one in a short period of time. All the stolen goods left behind by the bandits during their escape were also taken back to the police station for the victims to identify. After learning about this robbery case, the reporter went to the scene to investigate and saw that the boxes and belongings in the robbed households were scattered all over the floor after being searched by the bandits, as if they had been through a war. The walls of the Zhu Changfa tailor shop at number 1175 were covered with bullet holes, and the glass of the main door was also broken. When asked about the situation at the time, they only said that the sound of gunfire was like firecrackers going off. The bandit who was killed was lying at the bottom of the lane against the wall. There were several large patches of blood, shockingly red. Looking up at the wall, there were the words "Wang Deyan's Civil and Military Magic." One could not help but feel saddened for a long time.</p>
<h3>Two Women Commit Suicide by Poison in the Huizhong Hotel</h3>
<p>▲ Arrived Hand in Hand, Chatting and Laughing Freely</p>
<p>▲ Still Not Up by Noon the Next Day</p>
<p>▲ Hotel Attendant Investigates, Discovers Poisoning</p>
<p>▲ The Two Seemed Like Schoolteachers</p>
<p>At the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road, two women were found to have committed suicide by poisoning yesterday morning. The circumstances are quite bizarre, and the truth is still shrouded in mystery. The details are as follows: At 12:15 AM the day before yesterday, two fashionable women arrived hand in hand, claiming that their last name was Li and that they were sisters who had just come from Nanjing. The hotel receptionist did not suspect anything and immediately led them to a room on the second floor. The two women were calm and relaxed, chatting and laughing freely. They asked the hotel receptionist if they could get a discount for staying for a few more days. The Huizhong Hotel staff informed them that there were no discounts. The woman surnamed Li paid five yuan in advance and ordered two bowls of noodles from the room attendant. After eating, they closed the door and spoke for a while before falling silent. The room attendant and others assumed that the two women had gone to bed and fallen asleep, unaware that anything was wrong. Until 11 AM yesterday morning, the room attendant, following hotel rules, reminded them that staying past noon would require paying for another day. Since it was almost noon and the two women still hadn't made a move, they opened the door to inquire whether they would continue to stay. They saw the two women fully clothed, with their feet resting on chairs outside the bed, lying side by side as if they were eating opium in a燕子窠 (Yanzi Ke, opium den). The room attendant was shocked. Looking closely, they saw that their faces were pale and they were barely breathing. They knew that they had been poisoned and immediately notified the front desk, who reported to the Lao Zha police station. The police station dispatched police officers to the scene, who took the two women to the hospital for treatment. Later, the room attendant searched the room and found three empty cigarette boxes. The two women had southern accents, had cut their hair, and wore pink wool coats with fur collars. They were about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old and were quite attractive. They seemed like teachers, it was said.</p>
<h3>Dog Racing in the Public Concession to be Prohibited as Scheduled</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's ban on dog racing, after the Ming Shen and Liang Yuan respectively responded to the Public Works Bureau's letters on the 14th and 19th of last month, protesting the limited date, the Director-General of the Bureau, Feixin Dun, sent separate letters to the general managers of the two gardens yesterday, informing them that the Public Works Bureau had decided to implement the previous resolution. After March 31st of this year, dog racing will no longer be allowed in the Public Concession. It is expected that the two gardens will comply with the order and stop the races. It is anticipated that from April onwards, the vulgar custom of dog racing will disappear from the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Sues Father-in-Law</h3>
<p>▲ Father-in-Law Loves Illegitimate Son, Drives Away Her Husband</p>
<p>▲ No Means of Sustenance, Reduced to Beggary</p>
<p>▲ Asks for Inheritance for Her Daughter</p>
<p>▲ Debate Concludes, Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>▲ Sues Father-in-Law and Husband for Abandonment Local young woman Xu Ding, recently hired lawyer Fan Ming to sue her father-in-law Xu Zhilan and her husband Xu Xiaofu in the local court for conspiracy to abandon her, demanding alimony of 10,000 yuan and 8,000 yuan for the education of her daughter Fengzhen, and requesting provisional execution. The court held a hearing, but it did not conclude because the first defendant, Xu Zhilan, was not present.</p>
<p>▲ Family Fortune of Hundreds of Thousands Ms. Xu Ding now submits additional reasons, stating that her father-in-law Xu Zhilan, listening to false rumors, secretly hid all his property, drove away his legitimate son, abandoned his daughter-in-law, and incited his son to divorce her. His intention is to cut off the lineage of his second son, so that his hundreds of thousands of dollars of wealth will all go to his two illegitimate sons. The legitimate sons, a total of three, have all been driven out to live separately, while the two illegitimate sons live at home. One is destitute and reduced to beggary, while the other spends money like water and lives in luxury. The disparity in treatment is evident.</p>
<p>▲ Mother's Family is Lonely and Destitute Ms. Xu's husband Xiaofu has become disabled from illness. Her father-in-law used to give him 100 yuan per month for living expenses, but has stopped paying in recent years. Her negotiations have been ineffective. As a woman, she is unable to do anything, and it is unknown how she will maintain her livelihood. Furthermore, her mother's family lost her father early and has no brothers. Her mother is over sixty years old and is also lonely and destitute. Her father-in-law's absence from court is intended to delay the case. Her father-in-law has recently been trying to hide his property, which has come to her attention. If she does not take measures to stop him, it will be difficult to enforce the judgment in the future. She specially requests provisional execution to avoid delay.</p>
<p>▲ Withdraws Lawsuit Against Husband The costs of her daughter Fengzhen's marriage and education are requested to be paid in the amount of 8,000 yuan. Her husband Xu Xiaofu was previously listed as the second defendant because her father-in-law bribed him with 200 yuan to come to court and fabricate facts and make false statements. She had no choice but to do so. He realized his conscience in court last time and did not oppose her request. She also does not want to involve him, so she specially requests the court to allow the withdrawal of the part concerning the second defendant Xu Xiaofu to avoid burdening him.</p>
<p>▲ Women Have Property Rights Her father-in-law currently has more than 400,000 yuan in property (residential houses and city houses, totaling more than forty buildings, with monthly rent of more than 2,000 yuan), and a detailed list has been submitted for your review. The deposits in various banks and shares in various companies are kept secret and cannot be investigated. Current laws stipulate that women have the right to inherit property. Her daughter was born to his son and should naturally have the right to inherit the father's share. Now that her father-in-law has driven out his son, as reported in the newspapers, his bias is obvious. If she does not request alimony in advance, the danger in the future is cause for concern, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Xu Zhilan is in Hong Kong Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Jinjian continued the hearing. The defendant Xu Zhilan was still not present, but he was represented by lawyer Zhong, who stated that the defendant was in Hong Kong. On the second of this month, the defendant's family received a letter sent from Hong Kong on the 26th of last month, and the original letter was submitted as evidence. The judge read the letter and said, "The letter states that your lawyer is fully authorized to act on his behalf." Lawyer Zhong said, "This lawyer is not very clear on what can be admitted and what cannot be admitted."</p>
<p>▲ Defendant's Lawyer's Statement The judge ordered lawyer Zhong to state the defendant's age and origin. Zhong replied that the defendant Xu Zhilan is fifty-nine years old, from Ningbo, and currently lives in Mianjin Lane inside Dadongmen, Shanghai. He used to be in the pharmaceutical business. As for the plaintiff's claim that the legitimate sons were driven out, it is not true. The defendant's eldest son is currently running the Fengchang Newspaper Agency in Xiaodongmen. Xiaofu used to be the manager of a medicinal materials store, but tens of thousands of capital were lost, so the defendant gave him 1,000 yuan in the eleventh year of the Republic to break off their father-son relationship, and another 200 yuan in the nineteenth year to publish a notice, etc. The newspaper was also submitted as evidence. He also stated that the houses in Sanqing Lane where the plaintiff lives belong to the Deji Company. The defendant withdrew his shares last May. If the plaintiff moves back to the defendant's house to live together, the defendant will not refuse. The judge asked whether Xu Xiaofu was the defendant's biological son and whether the plaintiff was his daughter-in-law. Zhong replied that both were correct.</p>
<p>▲ Xu Xiaofu's Plight The court ordered Xu Xiaofu to appear in court (Xu was wearing very ragged clothes and looked like a beggar. His left hand and left foot were paralyzed, so he held a cane and limped into the court, looking quite miserable). The judge asked, "Is your father at home?" He replied, "I don't know." "Where did he go?" The judge asked, "Who wrote the separation agreement?" He replied, "My brother wrote it." The judge asked, "Do you agree to the separation from your father?" He replied, "I don't want to. Although the agreement says 200 yuan, I only received 100 yuan. I have nowhere to go now, please arrange for me, judge." The judge asked, "Why don't you live with your father?" He replied, "My stepmother won't allow it." The judge then ordered the debate to begin. First, the plaintiff's lawyer Fan stated that the plaintiff was young and her husband was disabled. The defendant's actions were too cruel and a judgment should be made. The defendant's lawyer Zhong rose to respond. The judge, understanding the situation, ordered the debate to conclude and set the date for the announcement of the judgment at 3 PM on the 12th of this month.</p>

<h3>Zou Aizhen's Counterclaim Against Tang Huixuan is Also Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Tang Huixuan, a doctor of economics, sued his wife Zou Aizhen for adultery with Chen Genwei. The case has been dismissed by the Procuratorate of the District Court. However, during the lawsuit, Zou Aizhen also countersued Tang Huixuan for false accusation and bigamy. The Procuratorate summoned Zou Aizhen to the court alone at 2 PM yesterday afternoon. Prosecutor Wu opened the investigation court and conducted a preliminary hearing for a long time. It is reported that the issue of false accusation was also not established.</p>
<h3>Suspect in the Assassination of a Foreman</h3>
<p>▲ Deceased's Wife Says He Didn't Do It</p>
<p>Zhang Genhan (Ma Pi Lao Si), a foreman of the Japanese-owned Minghua Sugar Factory in Yangshupu, was suspected of being involved in the murder of Gu A'quan, a native of Wuxi, on Pingliang Road. He was detained by the police and sent to the Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, the police also summoned Gu Chen, the wife of the deceased, and brought Zhang to the court. Judge Xiao interrogated him. According to Gu Chen, her husband was stabbed to death by a knife by a runaway "little fatty". The defendant was also at the scene, but did not do anything. When questioned, the defendant completely denied the charges and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him. The court ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for sentencing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Breach of Contract for Apartment Construction</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Weida Sues Wang Shouquan</p>
<p>Chen Weida hired a lawyer yesterday to file a lawsuit in the French Concession court, stating that the defendant Wang Shouquan, acting as the head of the Renji Construction Company, signed a contract with the plaintiff on October 25th of last year to construct a seven-story steel and concrete apartment building on Avenue Joffre for a cost of 71,000 taels. The old materials from the site were sold to the defendant for 6,000 taels. It was stipulated that the project would be completed within nine months. If the house was not delivered after the deadline, a fine of 100 taels per day would be imposed. The defendant's side entrusted Wan Yuanchang Jewelry Store's Wang Zijun as guarantor and provided a receipt as guarantee. However, after the contract was signed, there was no activity for more than three months. There was no wood or carts brought to the construction site. After the plaintiff's investigation, it was discovered that the defendant had used fraudulent means to sell the old materials of the house and then tried to solicit bids for construction with a third party at a tea party. However, no one was willing to contract, resulting in a long delay. It was also discovered that the receipt provided by the defendant was forged. The guarantor Wang Zijun of Wan Yuanchang Jewelry Store had been expelled by his father. All of these actions were false and constituted a violation of Article 363 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff requested an investigation. The defendant was also represented by a lawyer, who stated that Wang Shouquan was a well-known architect. He had signed a contract with the plaintiff, and the defendant subcontracted the construction to a third party, which was customary in the industry. Later, the plaintiff forced the defendant to issue a cancellation agreement, so the project was stopped. Moreover, since the defendant had sufficient guarantee, how could the plaintiff file a criminal lawsuit? It was illegal and the case should be dismissed. Judge Zhu ordered the guarantor to be summoned to court and the receipt to be transferred to the Land Bureau to verify its authenticity before further investigation.</p>
<h3>More Robbers Arrested in Pudong Xiku</h3>
<p>Wang Zhang's house in Pudong Xiku was broken into and robbed last year on the eve of the solar New Year. After the incident, the local Third District Police Station learned that the robbers Wang Jialin, Ji Qin Jie, and Yan Fuyu were hiding on Taopeng Road. They sent Chief Zhang with an official letter to the local police station to dispatch more detectives. They secretly went to the area the day before yesterday and arrested the three men. They confessed that Zhang A'bao from Wuxi was also an accomplice. Zhang was then arrested and sent to the Special District Court yesterday. Judge Xiao conducted a preliminary hearing and handed them over to the officers to be taken back for investigation.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Xin Xin Fraud Case</h3>

<h3>Woman Commits Suicide by Poison Out of Anger</h3>
<p>▲ Conflict with Son from Previous Marriage Du Yuanxiang, a middle-aged man from Shaoxing, lost his wife early and left behind a son named Yongxing, who is sixteen years old this year. After Du's first wife passed away, he married a woman surnamed Gu as his second wife. However, Yongxing was naturally stubborn and easily angered, and Gu was narrow-minded and unable to tolerate him. Therefore, the relationship between mother and son was like that of enemies. The day before yesterday afternoon, they quarreled over a trivial matter, and Yongxing scolded Gu harshly. Gu was very angry and secretly bought opium paste to commit suicide. Someone noticed and took her to Tongren Hospital, but the poison had already taken effect and she could not be saved. She died shortly after. The body was sent to the Forensic Institute on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Huaipu from the Special District Court arrived at the institute to conduct an examination. He took the bench, and the husband of the deceased, Du Yuanxiang, complained that his son was unreasonable and forced his wife to death, and that his son was now on the run and his whereabouts were unknown. The mother of the deceased complained that her daughter had died at the hands of her nephew and that she would not let it go. Guo then said that although your daughter died, it was due to her own narrow-mindedness. Therefore, she bought opium herself, not that Du Yongxing bought it for your daughter. Therefore, even if you want to punish Du Yongxing, there is no legal basis. He also said that the deceased Du Gu had indeed died by self-poisoning. The body was handed over to her husband Du Yuanxiang for coffin burial.</p>

<h3>Overview of Business in This City in January of the 20th Year</h3>
<p>This month, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works issued licenses for 128 construction projects, 146 repair projects, 136 miscellaneous projects, and 8 demolition projects. Compared to last month, construction, repair, and demolition projects have all decreased, while miscellaneous projects have increased by 50. The total construction area in the city, excluding single-story houses in rural areas, is approximately 28,700 square meters, with an estimated value of approximately 1.32 million yuan, both of which are less than last month. In terms of regional comparison, Fahua ranks first, followed by Hufnan, and then Zhabei. There are six large-scale projects with an estimated value of more than 50,000 yuan, with Zhabei, Hufnan, and Fahua accounting for two each. The details are as follows: (1) A certain Mr. [Surname Omitted] is building residential housing and bathrooms on Quanjia'an Road and Ouyang Road, covering a total area of 1,300 square meters with an estimated value of 44,000 yuan. (2) A Japanese person, Mr. Murayama Yoshimi, is building 22 two-story and three-story residential buildings on Huanglu Road, covering an area of 1,200 square meters with an estimated value of 80,000 yuan. (The above are in the Zhabei District.)

(The above are in the Fahua District.) This month, new houses are mostly built on open land, so the demolition area only accounts for 2,500 square meters. Due to fewer projects, enforcement matters are also relatively simple, with only 96 cases, mostly due to non-compliant projects, accounting for about two-thirds of the total. This month, routine inspections of public buildings were conducted, including 10 theaters and 212 tea gardens.</p>

<h3>Important News: Representatives of the Jiangxi Education Circle Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>▲ Educational Funds Will Have Proper Arrangements</p>
<p>▲ The Custody Issue is Being Discussed</p>
<p>Representatives of the Jiangxi education community, including Chen Yingchun, Zhu Yuanqing, Deng Tianmin, Tu Gang, and Yan Jiayuan, have arrived in Beijing and have been petitioning various parties for days. A general decision has been made. However, the representatives, noting that the Jiangxi Provincial Government had resolved that the Jiangxi Education Fund be independently managed by the Education Department, but in recent years, due to the impact of banditry, education fees have been in arrears for as many as six or seven months. Now that the central government has recovered the salt surcharge, they are repeatedly requesting the central government to instruct the West Bank Tax Transport Bureau to directly hand over the education funds allocated by the central government to Jiangxi Province to the education authorities for safekeeping. The process of their petition is briefly recorded as follows: (1) First, they went to the Central Party Headquarters. Secretary-General Chen was absent due to important business and delegated the Director-General of the Liaison Section to meet them, who promised to convey the points raised to the Secretary-General and submit them to the Standing Committee for approval and transfer to the National Government for review and handling in accordance with the party's program. (2) Next, they went to the National Government and were met by Chairman Jiang and Secretary Zhu. They then went to the Executive Yuan and were met by Secretary Liu. The representatives immediately stated their petition opinions: 1. Request the central government to subsidize the Jiangxi Education Fund with 2.07 million yuan from foreign tax items. 2. Request the central government to instruct the West Bank Tax Transport Bureau to directly hand over the funds to the education authorities for safekeeping in accordance with the established case. Secretary Liu said that the academy's directive on rectifying the style of study has clearly stated that education funds should not be lacking in the slightest. The Ministry of Education already has a plan for the education fund issue in various provinces, which can be resolved at the state council meeting in three days. (3) They then went to the Ministry of Education, where they were received by Vice Minister Chen. After the representatives stated their opinions, Chen replied that the central government would definitely come up with proper solutions because the education funds in various provinces had been affected by the abolition of levies and the unification of salt taxes. In addition, regarding the arrears in Jiangxi's education fees, he will earnestly consult the Jiangxi Provincial Government to allocate funds. Finally, Deng Tianmin, in the name of the manager of students studying in Japan, stated that the students studying in Japan were in extreme distress due to huge arrears and asked for relief. Chen replied that within the possible scope, he would allow efforts to be made. Next, they went to Finance Minister Song, who was not in Beijing but in Shanghai. The Secretary-General met them and said that the Jiangxi education fee had been ordered to be handled by the Salt Affairs Administration and other issues, such as increasing the 700,000 yuan and independent safekeeping, would have to wait for Minister Song to return to Beijing and ask for instructions. Finally, they went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and were met by Secretary Luo, who said that the central government had approved that the Jiangxi education fee would still be allocated from the salt surcharge from March. The representatives then reiterated that the Jiangxi education fee budget for this year must be at least 2.7 million yuan and that the independent custody of the education fund was decided by the 71st Provincial Affairs Conference in Jiangxi Province in the 17th year and was also stipulated by National Government Order No. 123. Therefore, they requested that the West Bank Tax Transport Bureau be instructed to directly hand over this fund to the education authorities for safekeeping in accordance with the established case in order to comply with the central government and provincial government laws and regulations. Secretary Luo replied that the custody issue would be reported to the head of the department and asked for instructions from the minister. In short, the ministry is clearly aware of the difficult situation of the education community in the province and has its own solutions. It seems that the province's education fee issue has been properly resolved. Therefore, the representatives will return to Jiangxi to report everything as soon as the reply is received.</p>

It has now been found that there are many principals who abide by the regulations, but there are also quite a few who are stuck in old habits and do not fully comply, such as not following the regulations regarding teaching hours, resulting in salary exceeding the budget, hiring teachers, and not following the regulations, resulting in many disputes. Such disregard for laws and regulations is not a proper approach. Now that the first semester is about to end and the second semester is about to begin, this order is being reiterated to ensure that the principals of each school strictly abide by the laws and regulations. In addition to publishing the order in Education Weekly, this order is hereby issued for your immediate compliance.

<h3>Mayor Zhang's Speech</h3>

<p>Yesterday, Mayor Zhang spoke with reporters to address slight errors in the record of his directive at the inauguration ceremony of Director Xu of the Education Bureau the day before. He stated that during the supplementary inauguration ceremony of Director Xu of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau on the 4th of this month, he quoted the resolution of the Third National Congress on political reports regarding education, saying that there were six abuses in current education, namely: (1) an abundance of schools, (2) an abundance of school operators, (3) an abundance of teachers, (4) an abundance of teaching materials, (5) an abundance of enrollment, and (6) an abundance of admissions to higher education.

Fearing that readers may not notice the details, he specifically asked you to correct them.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Students Studying in France Come to Shanghai to Petition</h3>
<p>丨To Promote the Problem of Students' Studying丨</p>
<p>▲ Cai Jie Min and Chu Minyi Both Agreed to Help Enthusiastically</p>
<p>▲ To Wait for Li Shizeng to Go South to Jointly Plan Proper Measures</p>
<p>After the end of the European War, Li Shizeng, seeing the domestic industrial recession and the immaturity of science, advocated that young students go to France to study. Between the years 8 and 9 of the Republic of China, as many as 2,000 people went to France. At that time, China and foreign countries were in an uproar, opening a precedent in the study abroad community. Later, France's economy gradually changed, and the Northern Warlord Government at that time was indifferent to this matter, causing the majority of young people to fall into a dangerous situation. After the establishment of the revolutionary government, when Li was sent to France, the remaining students were only a hundred or so. They had been working and studying in France for ten years. Now, they are unable to complete their studies due to economic limitations. Therefore, they appointed Liao Junyi, the secretary of the student union, as a petition representative to request Li to solve the problem of studying. At that time, he tried to find a way on the spot, but he was unable to solve it completely. Liao, bearing the heavy trust of the students, at his own expense, returned to the country from France in the autumn of the year before last, hoping to achieve his goal and then stop. He also stated that he would not accept financial assistance from any party, would not participate in other movements before the petition task was completed, would not apply for subsidies, and would not handle funds. After the matter was completed, he would immediately return to France. Liao has been back in the country for more than a year, running around in Beijing, Shanghai, and Peiping for the students, and has been deeply supported by the political and educational authorities. The funds he has secured include a 50,000 yuan appropriation approved by the Executive Yuan of the Central Government and a 28,000 yuan appropriation approved by the Hebei Provincial Government for recurring expenses. The items that are still to be discussed include a subsidy of 140,000 yuan approved by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee and 30 additional places for work-study students approved by the University of Lyon, France. Last year, Liao went to Hunan to appeal for students from Hunan, but due to the repeated ravages of soldiers and bandits in the province, public and private finances were in difficulty, and there was no result. Yesterday, he came to Shanghai to meet with Cai Jie Min, Chu Minyi, and the relevant authorities, asking them to expedite the realization of the funds that have been secured and the items that need to be discussed before this year's summer break so that the students can enroll on schedule. It is said that Cai, Chu, and others have all agreed to help enthusiastically, and once Li Shizeng arrives in Shanghai, they will jointly plan a practical solution.</p>
<h3>White Goose Art Exhibition in Recent Days</h3>

Du Xueou's still life landscape oil paintings are numerous, and the greatness of life can be seen in the quietness, which is a rare masterpiece.

<h3>Jinnan Football Team and Zhenru Basketball Team's Philippine Expedition (6)</h3>
<p>(Report from our reporter Wen Chu from Manila on January 20)</p>
<p>(1) Sino-Western Alumni Banquet</p>
<p>The Sino-Western School Alumni Association of Little Luzon held a banquet for the Jinnan Football Team and Zhenru Basketball Team on the 17th of this month. It was originally scheduled for last night, but it was changed to today because there was a basketball game at 6:30 PM yesterday. The grand occasion is also worth recording.</p>
<h3>History of the Alumni Association</h3>
<p>The Sino-Western School has a history of more than 30 years and is the oldest overseas Chinese school in the Philippines. The number of students attending classes day and night has exceeded 1,000 for several years. There are now thousands of graduates who are scattered in various fields of commerce, academia, and reporting, as well as in bank services and customs translation (the translators in the immigration department of the current Mariveles Customs are all graduates of the school). Famous lawyers in the overseas Chinese community such as Gao Zuchuan and young philanthropist and sportsman Lin Zhuguang were all top students at the school more than ten years ago. Therefore, in terms of the unity of various overseas Chinese organizations, the alumni association can be called the backbone. Because the members have been playmates since they were young, when they grow up, they will become a kind of combination, which naturally has many unspeakable interests.</p>
<h3>Relationship with Jinnan School</h3>
<p>In terms of students, those who return to the country to transfer to school and seek higher learning naturally come to this only highest institution of higher learning for overseas Chinese. Therefore, more than half of the current Jinnan Alumni Association in the Philippines are former alumni of Sino-Western School. In terms of faculty members, the former principals of Jin University, Jiang, Ke, Zhao, and the current principal Zheng, and Mr. Liu Shimu all communicate with each other. The leader of this time, Chen Xuege, was also a former teacher at the school and was sent to the United States for further studies with the financial support of Mr. Lin Zhuguang. Therefore, before the teams arrived, when the association was preparing to welcome them, they first welcomed them by radio to the ship, and when they arrived ashore, the combined team went to the pier to welcome them, expressing their utmost sincerity and love.</p>
<h3>Banquet Circumstances</h3>
<p>Held at the Mignon Hotel, a Western establishment, with the entire hall rented. Outside, in large Chinese and English characters, was written "Sino-Western School Alumni Association Banquet and Southern Football Team, Zhenru Basketball Team." Five or six alumni, including a lawyer named Gao Zuchuan and the Chairman of the Timber Merchants Association, Mr. Xu Youchao, wore lapel pins and greeted guests. Party and national flags, along with the flags of the United States and the Philippines, were hung all over the front windows. The banquet tables were arranged in a shape. At seven o'clock, the guests began to arrive, numbering over a hundred alumni and twenty-nine football and basketball team members. (Mr. Chen Zhenhe did not attend either banquet because the first competition was not a resounding victory.) Among the guests were Mr. Chen Yinglai of the General Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Lin Xijin, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Education Association, Mr. Xue Minlao, a lawyer, Dr. Zheng Han, principals of various bridge schools, reporters from various Chinese-language newspapers, current and retired teachers from Sino-Western schools, and over eighty prominent figures from the business community, totaling over two hundred attendees. The number of attendees at past alumni association banquets had never been so large, and the punctuality was also unprecedented. (Overseas Chinese banquets are officially set for seven o'clock, but the number of people often doesn't arrive until eight o'clock.) This shows that the overseas Chinese community is paying considerable attention to this returning team. During the banquet, Mr. Lin Zhuguang, the main speaker, outlined the purpose of the meeting, briefly stating that the most inspiring thing for overseas Chinese during these twenty years of the Republic of China</p>

<p>is the Jiannan University, the highest institution of higher learning for overseas Chinese, established to cultivate overseas Chinese youth. This time, the Southern Army's arrival in the South is a sure victory, not only enhancing international standing but also strengthening the bonds of the overseas Chinese community, etc. Mr. Li Mingxiang, an alumnus, was invited to deliver a welcome speech (Mr. Li recently graduated from the Business School's banking department at Jiannan University). Next, Mr. Wu Yanzhang, instructor of the football team, gave a speech. Then, Mr. Wang Zhensheng, coach of the basketball team, gave a speech. Finally, Mr. Chen Zhang'e, the team leader, gave a speech, stating that the purpose of this trip to the Philippines is roughly to promote national glory and strengthen relationships. Originally, Principal Zheng wanted to come to the South in person, but due to school affairs, it was cancelled. Before departing, he earnestly instructed the athletes to maintain the demeanor of great citizens and avoid conflicts over trivial matters that could harm relationships. Wu Yanzhang, representing the football team, and Wang Zhensheng, representing the basketball team, each presented the Alumni Association with a banner "as a souvenir," and the Alumni Association also prepared a plaque with the inscription "May Our Military Prowess Be Displayed" in large characters in the center. The small preface reads, "Jiannan University is the only institution of higher learning for overseas Chinese. In recent years, sports have improved, and it has repeatedly won championships from various universities in the country. This time, the team is heading to the Philippines. We wish them continuous victories, so as to promote the national spirit and enhance international standing. We respectfully offer these words to be kept as a souvenir in the midst of the crowd's welcome." Originally, more people were to be invited to speak, but because the athletes wanted to watch a boxing match between the Japanese and Filipinos and were concerned about interfering with their rest, the meeting adjourned at nine o'clock. Upon departing, the athletes shouted "Long live Sino-Western School!"</p>
<h3>(2) Honorary Advisor Meeting</h3>
<p>The prestigious advisors invited by Jiannan University, after meeting at a dinner party led by team leader Chen Zhang'e, elected Chen Yinglai, Li Ziquan, and Xue Minlao as directors. At 7:00 PM on January 20th, the three directors invited the advisors to a dinner at the Datong Club to discuss methods for assisting Jiannan University. Those present that day included Chen Yinglai, Xue Minlao, Consul General Kuang, Xue Fenshi, Chen Yuanhe, Zheng Hanqi, Cai Shaojing, Yang Kongying, Yu Yongrong, Zhan Houshi, Lin Xijin, Wang Quansheng, Li Fengrui, Chen Zhang'e, Yan Fuchu, and two representatives from the Jiannan Alumni Association. After the meal, Chairman Chen Yinglai asked Mr. Zhang'e to state the purpose of inviting the advisors this time and to mention that the football and basketball teams were scheduled for five matches until the 28th. The Charity Association wanted to invite the teams to play a few more matches to raise more income to return home on February 10th, and he would be responsible for the accommodation fees for these ten days. Mr. Chen declined. During the discussion, it was noted that Jiannan University, as an overseas Chinese institution of higher learning, was trying to develop sports but was limited by funding, and the overseas Chinese business situation was declining and could not provide sufficient donations. It was suggested that if the Charity Association were to hold additional matches, they could consult with the Consul General and the Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce. These two gentlemen would negotiate the admission fees, with some going to the Charity Association and some going to Jiannan University to develop sports. Then, the Consul General would jointly the Principal agree to the players staying for more games This plan, after being agreed upon by the majority, also discussed setting up a grand farewell party when the athletes were about to leave, with the prestigious advisors as the main body, and elected members to be responsible for the preparations.</p>

<h3>Record of the Skilled Shooter Zhong Shaokui · Yue · Fu</h3>
<p>Zhong Shaokui is from Tingzhou, western Fujian. He previously served as a battalion commander under Zhang Zhen of the Independent Fourth Division and Tan Shuqing of the New First Army. He is currently a military leader of the Tingzhou Hometown Rescue Corps. He possesses extraordinary skills. From a young age, he was proficient in martial arts, and he has particularly deep research into handgun shooting techniques. It is said that when he was twelve years old, bandits surrounded and looted the pawnshop next to his house. He was able to kill two bandits with a shotgun, thus settling the matter. His father was amazed and had him study military affairs. Later, as an officer, he still made shooting practice a daily routine. After five years, his skills greatly improved. Now, within twenty steps, his handgun shots rarely miss.</p>
<p>Last autumn, I returned to my hometown on business and met Shaokui at the Shanghang military station. We were as happy as if we had known each other all our lives. One afternoon, while walking in the western suburbs, we happened to see a wild mouse foraging on the ridge. I said, "You are skilled with guns, why don't you shoot it?" He listened to my words, took out a Browning, and fired a shot. The mouse fell dead on the spot. I praised him incessantly. He said, "This is just like the oil vendor in Ou Yangxiu's story, 'There's nothing to it, just practice makes perfect.'" We then passed a farmhouse where a large spider had built a web on the eaves. He said to me, "Now I will try out my skills. You stop. I can shoot this spider from ten steps away." Soon, there was a loud bang, and the spider was gone. At this time, the farmer's children did not know the details of the person who had come and laughed, saying, "The spider is afraid of the sound of the gun and ran away in a panic." I told them, "The spider is not afraid of the sound of the gun. It was actually killed by the bullet." The children said, "Is that so? If you can ask this gentleman to fire another shot and break the eastern end of this spider web, we will believe it." I asked Shaokui. Shaokui said, "Good. Let's try it." He held the handgun, aimed slightly, and fired. The eastern end of the spider silk broke. The children saw a part of the spider web fluttering in the wind. They all clapped and said, "Amazing! How divine is this gentleman's marksmanship!"</p>
<p>According to the villagers, in the autumn of the year Ji Si, Shaokui planned to capture the bandit leader Tang Xue</p>
<p>in the banquet. The subordinates surrendered their weapons. Last year, in May and August, the Fujian Western Red Bandits, led by Fu Bocui, launched two major invasions of Shanghang City, but were defeated. His wife, Madam Mou, also knows marksmanship and once assisted her husband in suppressing bandits. Details are in the Shantou and Xiamen newspapers. Many people know about it. (Thank you for the reward)</p>
<h3>The Bridegroom Returning from the Bandit Den Jing Mengdie</h3>
<p>As the year ends, banditry becomes more rampant. In the four regions of Changzhou, kidnappings are frequently heard of. However, some encounters are fortunate and some are unfortunate. In a village near Benniu, there was a son of the Zhang family. He had been newly married for just three days when bandits suddenly arrived, looting the contents of the bridal chamber and taking the groom away, demanding a ransom of a thousand gold pieces. However, the Zhang family was not wealthy. At that time, the bride's beautiful dream had just come true. Suddenly, a fierce wind arrived, and she saw her beloved husband leave the bridal chamber and enter the tiger's den, a separation worse than death. Her pain can be imagined. She rushed to kneel before her father and begged him to find a way to save her husband. The father frowned and said, "The family is poor. Even your wedding expenses were borrowed. I am already in debt. Where would I get the huge sum to satisfy the bandits' desires?" The bride knew that it was impossible to plan anything. She cried all night, sitting and waiting for dawn, truly "tears drenched the handkerchief, dreams unfulfilled." The next morning, she returned home and consulted her parents. However, the bandits' demands were extravagant, and they could not help. They were worried and had no ideas. Later, the bandits discovered the truth about the Zhang family and the bride's suffering. They generously reduced the price to a hundred gold pieces and sent word to the Zhang family. The bride was overjoyed and tried to raise the money to save her husband. The next day, Zhang's son indeed returned. From head to toe, he was brand new. His hat, shoes, and clothes were all gifts from the bandits. The looted items were also returned in full. However, one suitcase was no longer the old one. The bandits had damaged one corner of it, so they bought a new one to replace it. As Zhang's son left, firecrackers were set off, and wedding congratulations were given to send him off. The people on the roadside watched the groom, almost forgetting that he was a survivor of a robbery. This was truly great fortune in misfortune. Bandits also have a code of conduct. Is that true?</p>
<h3>Strange Child Huang Yingdai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a guest came from my hometown and mentioned that a certain family had given birth to a child with physiological differences from others. I recorded it immediately.</p>
<p>▲ Concubine Gives Birth to a Son Near Zhujiage, there is Anzhuang Town, with waterways in all directions and numerous rivers, where bandits often appear. In the town, there is a certain family that is moderately wealthy. They are already middle-aged but have no heir, which is a regret. So, they took in a concubine last year, surnamed Jiang. The concubine became pregnant, and the whole family was delighted. On the day of delivery, she gave birth to a son. The family was overjoyed to have a son in their old age.</p>
<p>▲ Strange Physiology However, after the child was born, upon closer inspection, his physiology was different from that of ordinary babies. The genitals were not very different, but another object was revealed at the anus, about five or six fen long, identical to the genitals in front. One person with two penises. Those who heard about it thought it was a monster, and the family was quite unhappy about it. They urgently wanted to find a way to get rid of it, but it was a pity to kill it and pitiful to abandon it. They were in a dilemma.</p>
<p>▲ Sent to the Infant Asylum Afterwards, after repeated discussions with relatives and friends, they decided to send the child to the infant asylum. So, they hired an old woman to take a boat at night and send him to the Zhujiage Infant Asylum. The old woman knew that this child was different and was uneasy, fearing that the infant asylum would discover it on the spot and send him to the authorities. Therefore, as soon as the asylum received the baby,</p>
<h3>Paris Stories (24)</h3>
<p>Fourteen The Roman Colonial Era Open-Air Theater</p>
<p>There are many cities in the world that are specifically for people to search for historical sites, such as those ancient civilizations along the Mediterranean coast. Conversely, in many newly built countries, such as the Americas, their cities are just a display of youth and strength. If we visit Rome, the capital of Italy, we will definitely feel that the past is conquering the present. Everywhere is a recollection of history. Those ruined wells and crumbling walls are filled with thousands of years of secrets. But when we visit New York, our feelings are completely different. We only have amazement at modern civilization. If we happen to think back to yesterday, it only makes us admire today's progress even more. But Paris is completely different. It is neither Rome nor New York, but it can be said to have both Rome and New York. Paris is an ancient yet new capital. Here, the latest material civilization of the twentieth century shines alongside the ancient ruins of two thousand years ago. After walking around those prosperous streets near the National Opera House, you can return to the small alleys in the Latin Quarter to stroll and feel that you have traversed several centuries in a day. After emerging from the newest subway, the epitome of modern civilization, you may see a very old building from hundreds of years ago or a famous sculpture that has experienced many rises and falls on any street you walk down. The past and the present are mixed together and do not make people feel unharmonious. This is the characteristic of Paris.</p>
<p>The best representation of this mixed image of ancient and modern is the Roman colonial era open-air theater in the 5th arrondissement. Not far from the Botanical Garden, near a very modern street called rue Monge, we can see a circular square surrounded by layers upon layers of orderly stone steps, just like the seats of the newest theaters that gradually rise. This is a relic left by the Romans in ancient Paris Lutece during their rule of the Gaulish people fifteen hundred years ago. It is now commonly called Les arenes de lutece, the Lutece Arena</p>
<p>she fled.</p>
<p>▲ Discovery of a Secret The staff in the infant asylum saw that the old woman looked flustered and knew there must be something unusual, but they did not suspect that the child had two penises. Later, when a nurse in the asylum was changing diapers, she saw that the child had another object growing behind his buttocks and realized the secret. She immediately ordered someone to go to the market to look for the old woman, but she was already gone without a trace.</p>
<p>▲ How Many Died Afterwards, the infant asylum could do nothing. They could only temporarily take care of this strange child. Unexpectedly, after this child entered, six or seven other babies in the asylum died one after another. For a time, superstitious people said that this child was an ominous object and urged the person in charge to get rid of him as soon as possible to avoid future troubles.</p>
<p>▲ Corpse Exposed on the Street The person in charge of the asylum believed that the deaths of the other children had nothing to do with this child, so he continued to take care of him as usual. However, not long after, this child also died of illness. The asylum, because the child's physiology was quite strange, exposed his corpse on the streets after his death. For a time, crowds gathered to watch, and they all exclaimed in astonishment.</p>
<h3>Wu Men Fun Anecdotes Vimalakirti Second</h3>
<p>The "Free Talk" section previously mentioned Gu Zishan of Wuzhong, who built a Yi Garden after retiring from his post. He planted flowers and bamboo and enjoyed poetry and wine. This is true. However, when I was young, I heard my elders say that the funds for building Gu's garden all came from his official pocket when he served as the Ningbo-Shaoxing-Taizhou circuit intendant in Zhejiang. Therefore, after the garden was completed, a humorist saw its inscription and ridiculed it, saying, "He never forgets Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Taizhou!" This is because the character "Yi" (怡) can be broken down into the characters "heart" (心) and "Tai" (台). It can be said that it was a cruel joke.</p>
<p>During the Tongzhi and Guangxu eras, Grand Academician Pan Shunzhi served as the head of the Ziyang Academy in Suzhou for several decades. No headmaster before or after him lasted as long. However, Pan had strong biases when grading papers. The top-ranked students were all famous scholars with good writing skills, while the others were placed there because they were his relatives and old friends. However, there were a few impoverished scholars among the specially ranked students, but they were in the minority. There was a certain student who always received low grades on every exam and had accumulated resentment for a long time. One year, it happened to be Pan's seventieth birthday, so he prepared a self-congratulatory poem and widely solicited students to write matching poems. The original poem was printed and distributed with the exam papers, and the accounting office was instructed to reward those who submitted matching poems generously. The student waited for Pan to be away and submitted his poem. The accounting office did not dare to open it but paid according to the usual procedure. When Pan returned and opened it, he saw the first two lines: "Pan Shunzhi is seventy years old, it is said that to be old and not die is to be a thief." Although Pan was filled with uncontrollable anger, he could do nothing about it.</p>
<p>After Grand Secretary Lu Fengshi passed the imperial examination, someone said that if Lu entered the cabinet, the Qing Dynasty would surely perish. Later, their words came true. People said that the person who said this had foresight. I say that Lu was uninhibited before he passed the examination and was known as the "Touring the City God in the Streets." He had long been looked down upon by society. Once he became the top scholar in the world, people were bound to be unconvinced. Therefore, they fabricated this saying to ridicule him. I did not expect it to become a prophecy.</p>

<p>Opposite to it, in the middle, are displayed the galloping horses pulling a chariot. Not only are the galloping movement and posture of the horses accurately depicted, but there is also a continuous surge of energy between the front and hind legs, showing a sense of vibrant life. It is titled Bige or Chariot a deux chevaux. The author's name is unknown. Based on its style, we may as well recognize this as a work from the period when Greek sculpture reached its completion.</p>
<p>There are too many treasures here. It's truly "rarities clog the path, and one is overwhelmed!" I also successively saw thirty or forty pieces of stone of various sizes, either a large head or a fragment of a body. Studying them piece by piece, none of them are not rare treasures. However, there are too many large things here, inevitably overshadowing them. I can only briefly describe them here. Gradually walking into the salle en croix grecque, on the central platform is the Venus stone statue, ten feet tall, meticulously crafted by the famous craftsman Praxiteles. The goddess, with her upper body exposed and her hands pulling at the hem of her garment, is the goddess of love and beauty in Greek mythology. This is Praxiteles' masterpiece. The whole is extremely beautiful, with high breasts, a broad forehead, and green eyes, showing a gentle emotion. The hair uses a rough carving technique to achieve the effect of light in painting. This Venus statue has extremely important significance in the expression of the female nude. It is a beautiful goddess statue with a human touch. Before him, there was not much obvious difference between the nude figures of women and the bodies of men. Starting with him, he fully expressed the unique magic and beauty of the female body, so it became a groundbreaking work.</p>
<p>Only their songs can still be heard by us centuries later. They wielded their hands, using blunt knives to carve rough stones, imbuing them with various extraordinary lives. Glory and greatness are one of the endless, infinite lives. Phidias, who created the Parthenon and the Olympian Zeus, and the many Greek masters mentioned above, such as Myron, Praxiteles, and Lysippos, were, like the rest of the Athenians, citizens of free states and believers in polytheism. They were raised in gymnasiums, wrestling, naked, discussing state affairs and voting in the square. Even the most important points in their outlook on life were the same as those of the Greeks of the same era. Their lofty sentiments, elegant faces, and great discoveries and creations were by no means accidental.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Price Reaches Seventy Taels</h3>
<p>▲Wild Increase of Thirteen Taels and Two Mace</p>
<p>▲Major Bars Expected to Rise Today</p>
<p>The Force of Change is Immense: Yesterday, February 5th, the benchmark gold price turned from decline to sharpness. The force of change was very strong. The difference between the pre-market and post-market prices was more than ten taels, with a total daily fluctuation of twenty-five or six taels. Looking back, the situation was like a violent storm, with an unstoppable momentum. People were panicked and helpless. In addition, the exchange rate was initially loose and then tight, with the listed price remaining the same as the day before yesterday. The market was lively and cheerful. Major players such as Sin Heng, Wing Heng, Yuan Sheng, and Fook Cheong were all buying in the pre-market, and there were quite a few short covering. However, the sellers were mostly small households. As for the overseas silver market, England fell and the United States rose, seemingly diverging. Gold prices have already shown a reaction and opened low. Afterwards, they hovered around seven hundred and fifty taels, causing considerable confusion. Suddenly, there were thousands of changes, and the price once fell to forty-five taels. At noon, speculators rushed to buy, and the price rebounded to a peak, rising sharply by ten taels. The post-market was even more sharp. Companies such as Sin Heng, Wing Heng, Yuan Mao Wing, and Yuan Sheng showed strong buying interest, and the exchange rate was exceptionally tight. The gold price soared like an angry horse, surging more than ten taels. Suddenly, a new era of seven hundred and seventy taels and five mace, unprecedented in history, was seen again. Finally, it fell slightly by five or six taels. It is said that the major silver bars may rebound this morning.</p>
<p>▲Initial Rebound in the Morning: From the opening of the March benchmark gold price in the morning at seven hundred and forty-six taels and a half, it immediately fell by five taels and three mace. This was because although the major bars were lower by three-eighths, and the forward bars by five-sixteenths, the silver price rose by one-eighth. Moreover, there was a telegram from the United States maintaining the market, so people's confidence waned. In addition, private telegrams also added one-eighth, and Yuan Xing Yong, Yu He, etc., all sold. Next, it was forty-five taels. Soon, Tai Kang Run, Wing Heng, Chun Yuan Yong, etc., came in, and because HSBC bought in March English gold for 126,875, and the bank did US dollars for this month at 29.75, it rose to fifty-four taels at 9:20, then retreated by more than two taels. The first order was announced not to change for the time being at fifty-one and a half taels. After a short time, there was a rise and fall of two taels. Soon after, Tai Kang Run, Yuan Mao Yong, etc., sold off one after another, because the exchange rate loosened. Mitsui bought April US dollars at 30.0625, and MacGalli sold current English gold at 128,125. Furthermore, the current Dalian Mitsui, etc., bought only 1 tael, 6 mace, 5 fen, 1.25 li, so the gold market weakened. At 10:00, it fell to forty-four taels and eight mace. Afterwards, it rebounded again, as the forward English gold was mutually traded by banks at 8125. Moreover, Wing Heng, Fook Cheong, Yuan Heng, etc., joined forces and advanced, and people's confidence turned upward, stepping onto the clouds, and breaking through the fifty tael mark again. However, from 10:15 to 11:15, the price fluctuated constantly within and around fifty taels. Afterwards, Sin Heng, Wing Heng, Yuan Mao Yong, etc., continued to buy tirelessly, and the supply was constant, causing the price to rise further. The market closed at noon at fifty-five taels and five mace, and was raised again to fifty-seven taels. Goods were traded at one tael higher, with listed prices still calculated at eight hundred and nineteen taels, with margins calculated at sixty-seven, sixty-eight taels to seventy-three, seventy-four taels, and sixty-three taels at noon.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Financial Circles in the Midst of Liquidation</h3>
<p>This year's liquidation of accounts by the silver and money industry is more difficult than in previous years. Since the use of the Gregorian calendar is an innovative method, many merchants in other cities are watching the issue of settlement of accounts. The deadline for collection is approaching day by day, and it is necessary to expedite the conclusion. As a result, exchange funds and foreign shipments from various cities have arrived one after another, but the total amount of loans released by the silver and money industry is huge. According to current estimates, only 30% to 40% has been collected, and the majority of the arrears are still outstanding. It is hoped that there will be good results this week, otherwise, silver-deficient families will be affected.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Markets Slightly Firmer</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures market for various public bonds was still good, and many types of spot trading were opened, but transactions were still sporadic.

<h3>Yarn, Flower and Cotton Markets Become More and More Fierce</h3>
<p>▲Following the Repeated Leaps of the Cotton Market</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm and rising sharply, but the sale of current yarn is stagnant. Due to the approaching settlement period, the gangs have no intention of purchasing, so transactions are deserted. However, the local market atmosphere is soaring unabated. The exchange rate is shrinking strangely, resulting in high import prices for foreign cotton, and raw cotton is rising step by step, driving up the yarn market. General retail investors see the environment as unfavorable and have to endure the pain of closing out, so it is becoming more and more tight. This kind of rising trend is quite terrifying, and it is difficult to predict what the future holds.</p>
<p>▲Man-made Standards Jumping Four Taels: When the man-made standards market opened in the pre-market, the market atmosphere was still flat due to the rising trend of American cotton. In the second and third rounds, the market atmosphere suddenly tightened due to the soaring prices of raw cotton, and each month turned sharply upward. The near month rose by 2 taels and 1 mace, and the far month rose by 1 tael and 5 or 6 mace. In the afternoon, the cotton market rose sharply and erratically, and the yarn market was even more激. The buying sentiment was even stronger. The near month rose by another 1 tael and 6 or 7 mace, and the far month rose by 2 taels and 8 mace. The total transaction volume for the day was 59,600 bales. It was found that He Shen sold 3,600 bales, Sheng Tai sold 2,650 bales, Yu Da sold 1,350 bales, Chang Feng sold 1,450 bales, Tai Chang sold 1,150 bales, and De Ji sold 1,550 bales. Heng Chang bought 1,350 bales, Gong Tai bought 2,600 bales, Tian Long bought 3,000 bales, Rui Da bought 2,450 bales, and Yi Chang bought 1,250 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Man-made Standard Closing Price Rise and Fall Inventory</p>
<p>February 160.9 Up 3.7 34,250 May 1668 Up 49 62,950</p>
<p>March 161.7 3.8 62,800 June 1660 46 48,400</p>
<p>April 165.4 4.3 71,000 July 1670 43 9,400</p>
<p>▲Yarn Sales in a Quiet Situation: The sales of current yarn are very clear. It was found that the gangs bought only 150 bales throughout the day, and 10 bales were imported among the peers. The market price rose by 2 or 3 taels. Among the customer gangs, Tianjin imported 60 bales, the inland imported 70 bales, Jiangxi imported 10 bales, and Shantou imported 10 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Fear of Soaring Winds</h3>
<p>The fierceness of the cotton market's rising winds has been rare recently. It is actually because the market price of foreign cotton is trending upward, and the exchange rate is difficult to lengthen, resulting in a surge in the combined price of silver. Many new entrants and speculators have flocked to it, so the buying sentiment in the market is becoming more and more intense, and sellers dare not act rashly. Therefore, only buying voices are heard, and sellers have disappeared suddenly, so there is this fierce rising trend. The 40 tael mark is approaching, but the momentum is still fierce. The future depends on the exchange rate for advancement and retreat.</p>
<p>▲Han Standard Soared by Two and a Half: When the Han Standard market opened in the pre-market, the market sentiment was very good due to the rise in American cotton. There was a lack of sellers, and each month rose by 6 or 7 mace. The situation in the afternoon was even more intense, and buyers flocked to it. The current month rose by 1 tael and 0.5 mace, and the far month rose by 8 mace and a half. The total transaction volume for the day was 122,900 dan. It was found that Ji Feng sold 5,400 dan, Guangdong sold 4,600 dan, Shen Chang sold 4,800 dan, and Xin Heng sold 3,800 dan. Tian Long bought 11,900 dan, Mei Ji bought 3,500 dan, Gong Tai bought 4,400 dan, Ming De bought 5,900 dan, Rui Da bought 3,000 dan, and Xin Cheng bought 3,400 dan.

<h3>Grain Rice Market Quiet in Rainy Weather</h3>
<p>▲Zhabei: Yesterday, more than 30 boats arrived from various gangs, and the market sales were sluggish due to the difficulty of opening the river buckets in rainy weather, so transactions were sparse. The removal of northern japonica was light, and prices were stable. The import and export of Bo Dao was even rarer, and the situation was extremely quiet. The selling of Yangdu埠秈 was sluggish, and only warehouse goods had some transactions. The market price was not very glorious, and the change of Yin Yuan River was extremely thick in storage. This goods have been shelved for a long time and is not suitable for a long time, and the general trend shows a soft image in the determination.</p>
<p>▲Hunan: Yesterday, more than ten river sources arrived</p>
<h3>The Stable and Leisurely Flour and Wheat Market</h3>
<p>▲ Flour Trading Suspended for Ten Days Starting from the 11th</p>
<p>▲ Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of stabilization again. Although the quoted prices for foreign wheat fluctuated, for some reason, the demand from domestic merchants was surprisingly strong. While factories continued to order foreign wheat, they also continued to sell. Because the market sentiment was still firm yesterday, sales were slow, so the market sentiment inevitably appeared bullish. However, the biggest factor was that the opening of this month’s trading period was only for four days. It is said that the market will be closed for ten days from the 11th to the 20th for market repairs, so most speculators are eager to cover their positions, which is also a factor contributing to the improvement of the market. As a result, the price for this month remained unchanged, March increased by one cent, April and May increased by 7.5 li, and June and July increased by 5 li.</p>
<p>▲ Wheat: Yesterday, the futures wheat market generally showed a hovering trend. Since there were no significant fluctuations in foreign wheat, and speculators had already closed their positions, and there was no news of further foreign wheat orders, sellers were rare. On the buying side, because factories remained unchanged, and outsiders gradually reduced their positions due to habit, transactions were very rare. As a result, the prices for this month and March/April remained unchanged, May decreased by one cent, June increased by two cents, and July remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse and White Sugar Prices Called for Increases, But Demand Was Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams from production areas stating that the spot price of Cuban sugar remained unchanged. In New York, the March price fell by more than two cents, and the prices for other months also fell by one cent each. The spot and futures prices of Java sugar remained weak. Although the market sentiment for No. 24 Dutch coarse and white sugar in the Association market was strong, transactions were few. The asking price increased by ten taels and eight qian, but there were no inquiries. The market was slightly flat. Transactions for medium-grade white sugar were also scarce. The import and export of Japanese sugar were also sporadic, mainly because the closing period was near. N Mark was at ten taels, seven qian and five fen, Meiji YP Mark was at ten taels and nine qian, Minghua goods were at ten taels, eight qian and five fen, YT Mark was at ten taels and seven qian, and YRO Mark was at ten taels and three qian, with slightly more transactions. The rest of the market was unusually quiet.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Fine Cloth Rise Most Sharply</h3>
<p>▲ Tianjin Merchants Still Searching for Goods</p>
<p>▲ Local Factory Cloth: The market continues to rise, especially for fine cloth, which is rising the most sharply. Yesterday, Tianjin merchants made large-scale purchases, causing the price to rise by another one qian to one qian and a half. Trumpet Boy Yang Crane small packages have reached seven taels, and Blue Double Fish has reached seven taels and two qian or so. Fine twill has also risen by one qian. Blue Double Fish is at seven taels and five fen, and Yang Crane is at seven taels and three qian. There is a severe shortage of coarse cloth in stock. Because the price has not yet been announced since the implementation of the factory exit tax, those who had advanced money previously could not export, so both 13-pound and 11-pound goods were in short supply yesterday. However, there is still a large inventory of white flannel. It is currently the off-season, and there have been quite a few sales in recent days, with prices falling by about two qian compared to before.</p>
<p>▲ Eastern and Western Piece Goods: Gold prices are soaring, and everyone is unanimously optimistic. Tianjin merchants were still actively purchasing Eastern goods yesterday. Straight tribute satin, straight tribute woolen cloth, and fine serge were being searched for extensively. Civilized Nankeen and White Crepe, Red Label, which are not yet at the sales season, have also begun to be traded. At this time, when businesses are closing accounts for the Lunar New Year, this large amount of trading is unexpected. Six-pound Guo Ju red cloth sold for four taels and nine qian and a half. Dahe Trading has already opened at five taels. Boy Music Civilized Nankeen was at two qian, three fen, and two and a half li. Man and Dog Crepe was at four taels and two qian and a half. Traders’ asking prices jumped wildly. Santan Straight Tribute Woolen Cloth required four qian and two fen, Ancient City Association Serge required three qian and nine fen, Happiness required three qian, five fen and a half, and Double Boy Deer Straight Tribute Woolen Cloth sold to Tianjin merchants for three qian and four fen. As of yesterday, Yoshida had already opened at three qian and six fen and a half. The intensity of the rise is even greater than before.</p>
