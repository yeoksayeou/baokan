<p>時評</p>
<h3>今後敎育上基本問題之討論（一）</h3>
<p>時已初秋。假期將滿。國内各級學校當局。乃特顯忙碌。一方面忙於招考。一方面復忙於籌備開學。聘任敎授也。編製課程也。通吿學生也。種種準備執行其神聖之敎育任務之忙碌情狀。皆在吾人意想之中。記者偶檢昨日本報刋登各校之招生廣吿。得數六十有五校。復一檢閱八月十四日北平晨報。得校三十有九。此登載廣吿之學校。十之九都在上海及北平。或且尙有未登者焉。以此推至各省各埠。則在下學年中靑年之就學者。其將增添若干人。蓋無可疑。吾人據十七年敎育統計。全國大學及專門學校學生爲一九·四五三人。中學學生爲二三四·八一一人。即就中學生而論。平均尙須一千七百人中方能有一人。小學生爲七百餘萬人。但學齡兒童失學者。尙在三千五百萬人以上。全國文盲據約計爲百分之八十。就此點而言。則姑無論敎育之方針如何。功效如何。結果如何。就學靑年數量之增多。即國内文盲數量之减少。此應爲可喜現象之一。</p>
<p>雖然敎育之功能。就其大者而言。爲立國之大本。爲其小者而言亦。爲如何導引國民精神生活與實際生活臻於健全與暢遂之關鍵。敎育對靑年所負之責鉅。對社會對國家所負之責更鉅。然而此艱鉅之責。就事實言。過去已否盡了。大抵三尺孩提皆能作答。惟敎育之責鉅。惟過去敎育之效率低。懲前毖後。鑒往追來。故記者不得不於新學年開始。學校招生大批靑年就學之際。謹以數事商陳學校當局</p>
<p>（一）招生之動機。是爲照例。抑有事先之計劃。招生之目的。是爲學生。爲社會。抑爲學校。或且爲個人。</p>
<p>（二）投考靑年是來自各個社會層。抑有所偏倚。如其偏。則敎育爲畸形。敎育之效能亦爲畸形。此畸形之現象。將聽其自然。抑亟謀有以補救。</p>
<p>（三）今日招學生入學。是否已計及將來學生出路。即學生將來畢業而後。在社會應做何事。可做何事。能做何事。諸問題是否曾有事先之籌思。</p>
<p>於此記者有須鄭重聲明者。上陳三點。絕非對個人而發。其目的純在於求改進敎育。增進敎育之效能。切盼讀者勿以辭害意。至其理由。容當續言。</p>

<h3>興安區金礦開放說</h3>
<p>▲刻正探察金苗談不到開採</p>
<p>▲英人專利十年說完全無稽</p>
<p>▲鄒作華由奥赴英經美返國</p>
<p>天津通訊、近來平津滬各報迭載北滿及興安區開放金礦、准許英人專利十年及二十年之說、此事關係我國礦權綦鉅、記者特致函興安區屯墾總辦高仁紱（按屯墾督辦鄒作華奉命赴歐美考察墾務、於本年五月間放洋、督辦職務、由高代理、）探詢眞相、兹接覆函、知係有人造謠、大要節錄如左、想爲關心礦業主權者所樂聞也、「頃奉手書、備承指示、至爲感泐、敝區金礦、藴藏雖富、惟未經探察手續、不知質量究竟如何、而此項探察人材國中又極缺乏、是以敝督辦放洋之時、有約採金公司代探之事、純係探察性質、談不到開採及專利、合同即本此意而訂、不意反對之人、竟舍去事實、摭拾浮言、遽相攻擊、殊屬無的放矢、然此等事、數見不鮮、敝署向持不理主義、如有人詢及、請兄據實代爲剖釋即可、是非自有公論、非吠聲吠影者所能淆亂事實也、敝督辦刻由奥赴英、一俟轉赴美洲考察之後、即可謀歸矣、」</p>

<p>奈何天二人之對角之正反抽球、準確罕見惠特無論高低抽擊、俵氏必有法應付、徒喚奈何、而俵氏猛烈之削球、則無法回答然惠特第三盤中數次壓殺之美妙、亦博得掌聲不少、第六局惠特才得一局觀此戰後、咸謂欲勝俵氏、不能徒持抽擊、須重戰略也、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>世界第一慢呼吸人</p>
<p>凡是人類。每分鐘的呼吸總在十五次至十八次之間。大抵都是如此。不道美國包爾的馬Baltlmore地方却有一個婦人。每分鐘只呼吸三次至五次而已。</p>
<p>伊的呼吸的遲慢。先前並没覺察。五六年前。伊在大學校中研究生理學。纔發見伊的呼吸。不及别的同學們那麽快。那遲慢的程度。竟打破以前的一切記錄。有一位著名的醫生。曾到過歐洲二十個都巿。先後曾向醫學家七萬人演講醫學。據說從没有遇見過一個呼吸如此遲慢的人。</p>
<p>普通的人。每次吸入的空氣。只有一品脫的容量。而這婦人每次却能吸入三品脫。而察看伊的肺部。也與普通人一般無二。並不比他人爲大。倘如伊從事游泳。那麽潛在水底定可特别的持久。而且唱起歌來。聲音也可特别的延長。</p>
<h3>茉莉零譚</h3>
<p>— 陳漪蕙</p>
<p>四時花類。可愛者甚蕃。當此炎夏。蓮也。荷也。均擅艶名。爲騷人逸士所鑑賞。而見於詩文傳載者不少。中如茉莉一花。品貌不亞羣芳。銷用之廣。且冠之。亦時時見之新詞中焉。</p>
<p>茉莉。來自西域。譯名爲耶悉茗。又以種同素馨名之。後分尖瓣者曰耶悉茗。圓瓣者曰茉莉。葉大如盞。花小如豆。色純白。香甚烈。閩廣種之最多。今閩省所種者。類皆圓瓣昔陸賈南行記云。南越五穀無味。百花不香。獨茉莉不隨水土而變。於此亦可見此花在南之價値矣。</p>
<p>種之之法。其時宜春。其土宜疏。雜以沙更妙。莖長葉盛時。只溉以水。不需養料。自能含苞吐蕊。其工頗省。無論栽於盆。栽於園。皆能生長。其收效更易。</p>
<p>於羣芳中有特長處。凡百花卉。摘後必須插於瓶。養以水。方能煥發。不致萎斃。莉獨不然。摘其蕊。不連梗。串以線。纍纍如貫珠。花放。經數日不凋。或繫之扇柄。扇動香生。沁人心肺。或懸之烟筒。香隨烟氣氤氲而撲鼻。或綴成穗。結於繡榻之中。使黑甜鄉。頓成香城。又可爲婦女妝飾品。未截髮者。髻簪之。已截髮者。額環之。使秀麗玉顔。與皎潔花容。相映而俱妍。晉書。都人簪奈花。爲織女帶孝。蓋北方稱茉莉曰奈。然則北地女性之用爲裝飾。由來久矣。</p>
<p>利源最廣者。厥爲製茶。精貴之茶。如雀舌各種。槪以茉莉窨之是以茶味芬芳可口。撿其殘者。焙於香片。故香片之味遜之。廣州九里。曰花田。福州南區鳳崗一帶。亦曰花田。採花者。乘晨光禀微。花蕊含露。提筐挈搕。踵往摘之。一至夕陽啣下。荷者挑者。紛紛登巿。投售茶棧。鄉人有專營此利者。每年可獲千餘元云。</p>
<p>閩人書茉莉。多書爲苣莉。誤也。苜者。苜蓿也。飼牛馬之用。與茉莉不同種。附誌於末。以正訛謬云。</p>
<h3>弘正壇訪問記</h3>
<p>— 琅玕</p>
<p>人鬼異趣。幽明殊途。神怪之事。儒冠不談。孔子謂未知生。焉知死。聖人尙作斯言而况常人乎。顧天下事實有不可思議者。方以物理。律以常情。均有所弗能。然事實斑斑。異蹟昭昭。則又爲人所不欲信而不得不信者。扶乩其一也。友人謝君文榮。向主有神論者。篤信此道。隷弘正壇爲弟子。常以扶乩之靈騐語余。堅邀往觀。以證其言之非妄。乃於上週偕孫君同往參觀。壇設界路慶祥里。地殊湫隘。拾級登樓。數轉逹室内。香烟繚繞。中人欲嗆。四壁懸神照及乩書濟公及純陽兩照。鬚眉畢現。淸晰可認。謂係從太空中攝取者。一異也。坐約半小時。開始扶乩。室中人咸屏息以待。狀殊虔誠初見沙盤中畫圓圈無數。不成文字。繼則扶者兩手大動。漸可認識。是日適値觀音大士誕日。諸神仙咸往祝嘏。壇主濟公在南海未歸。沙盤中現守壇在一寸香等字樣。囑令稍待再扶。衆乃退息。先是余儕與謝君約。謂當向神一叩休咎。藉卜命運。君乃詢主事者。以黃簽進。書寫姓名及所叩事項。余兩人乃各繕一條。問終身休咎。請神賜詩一首。兩黃簽均壓置祭桌上。待寸香時過。重復開盤。而壇主濟公。亦於此時駕返矣。稍作二三十字後。即及余儕所叩之事。凝視注沙盤中。筆筆飛舞。如龍如蛇。不可卒讀。扶者則手作一字。即口呼而令筆錄者記之。旣竟。視之。則一二四句均係六字。第三句爲七字。且係兩人共賜一詩。原文云。「渺渺諄而過。勿欲推出窗門。一時夏雨速臨頭。且待何時自足」。究竟是何意義。窮思不得其解。心殊惑焉。日前晤疇隠居士丁仲祜先生。叩以扶乩事。先生筦爾曰。所謂濟公與純陽者。不敢謂其有。靈魂之說。不敢謂其必無也。因爲余言「常談叢錄」胡君彦甫事。胡君彦甫。授徒家塾。一日有客至。將遣人。巿欵客具。以紙疏列條單。下筆覺縱横牽掣。不能隨意所欲書。大駭。以爲病作。然置筆則手亦如常。略無所苦。復執筆。又似前狀。客曰。是殆乩動耶。予見鍊筆乩者。其狀正若此。顧君固未嘗習乩。不信。時族之儒冠數人。俱集。羣敎以虚握筆。姑信手書之。則字大如盌。欹斜粗拙。辨視。識爲曾子固三字。衆詫謂南豐先生來。因焚香致敬。請吟詩。辭不能。相顧歎惜。人傳南豐長於文而短於詩。洵不誣哉。乃叩以集中記序諸作。又辭以年久盡忘。衆已疑怪。是日適値春社。即以爲題。强使咏之。作五言絕一首。鄙俚殊甚。問能制藝否。曰能。指本日館課題試之。不能通順。衆爲譁笑而罷。次日。執筆又如昨。但字畫稍端。略作初見欵叙語。問仍是子固否。曰非也。昨來者是假托。彼蓋某村某人。早廢業。若我則在人世爲國子生。曾學八股文成篇。更自道居里姓名甚悉。衆遂明知是鬼乩。較昨日來者。果文理稍通順。叩以事。所答亦在人意中。無甚奇異。偶執筆即來。語多瑣屑。厭而謝焉。然不時仍至一夕。臥衾中。手振振欲動。君深慮爲　擾。家人聞之益悚懼。亟移牀歸。並徙館焉。自是遂絕。後亦無他。</p>
<h3>世界第一富翁</h3>
<p>— 顔也</p>
<p>印度人尼賽姆有資産逹十萬萬美金。爲全世界第一富翁。彼之十萬萬金圓。率爲珠寶與赤金。而此鉅財。不存於保險之銀庫。盡藏於家。所處之海逹拉巴。地實僻野。彼爲謀財寶之安全計。特於室之四週。築城垣以圍之。精練壯丁以守之。重砲利槍。堅若金池。鼠竊狗偷者所不能一窺也。尼賽姆至吝。一切慈善事均不能破其慳襄。惟於歲時僕役輩之賜予。則又動輙數千金或竟萬金。以是人咸怪之。彼又語人曰。我之財産。我得以自由意志處置之。我子而能肖我。我即付之。苟不爲我愛。則我將供諸世人。頃刻可散盡也。今我猶能力保之。天賜我以鉅財。我不能不盡保守之責。力能保之而以責付諸人。是負天也。至力不能保而不付諸能負此責者。亦負天也。故我之保守之責。今猶未可去。即去亦未獲付託之人也。今之論尊重財産者。謂財産當盡量用於生利之途。爲社會國家人羣造福。尼賽姆之言之行。皆背於此者。又聞世界之富。首推美國。而富翁之多。亦以美爲最多。惟若福特等全美之四大富翁。亦僅人各五六萬萬圓。故皆不足與尼賽姆氏比。此尼氏所以爲世界第一富翁也。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（八四）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>印民之有國民運動也。始于一八八九年。然不過能上禀于政府而已。至一九○九至一九一一年經日俄戰後。印人乃恍然小亞人能勝大歐洲大邦。何况大印度乎。至中國革命。印人乃决心起事。甘地運動已有二十餘年。而奏效乃在最近數月。數月之進步。勝于前二十年。上級官全爲英人。中級官有權者亦英人。間雜以閒職屬印人。下級官實權仍屬英人。惟當警察屬印人耳。英人養兵之費。一年六萬萬盧比。但英人之兵。平時不顯。蓋示其文明寛大。一旦有事。則如風雨驟至。以示其不可測。多屯于北邊。以防中俄也。印人乃羊耳。無防之可言。</p>
<p>印度地理大致分三部。一喜馬拉雅山之部。在極北一帶寒地。其住民甚密。接近中國西藏。印人稱西藏亦曰中國。三曰恒河流域。自加爾吉打以至拉好一帶。皆恒河流域。政敎富强之地。爲人又中心。三爲沙漠以南。南印度各省。</p>
<p>余所遇老人學生幼童及女士僧侣。均喜聞中國事。喜到中國來。亦不知其所以然也。余覺凡事皆有自然之機運。運到非人所能爲也。印度對中國之感情發生。有數原因。一因外力壓迫。則思與彼表同情者。三知佛離印度而往中國。中國爲彼第一同情之友。地大人衆。又無野心。三其覺日本中國暹羅均佛國。而日强盛。故慨然思念中國愛華人。因華人傳播印度文化于世界。又作爲印度之東道主也。此等感情。不期然而發生。英抑我華沐天竺敎澤。身心解脫。消我多少災難。國泰民安數千年。于兹知恩報恩。乃其本分。若印人能來應香花匝之矣。各地佛社僧寺皆其合館也。昔太戈爾向我索數千年老樹之果。此其時矣。中國爲亞洲文化之冠冕。扶印度。興猶太。聯回暹興繼。滅絕天下歸心。此非二十世紀中華民族之本分乎。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>女人女人（二四）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>小榮的妻子在後面房間裏，早就聽見伊的丈夫走進來了，心頭的火再也按瞧不下，正想跳出去質問他，却給秋子勸住伊自己也就想起了方才丁小姐叮囑伊的話，祇得耐住了一肚子的悶氣，依然守在那裏，</p>
<p>但是，從門罅裏伊偷眼瞧見了伊丈夫對於丁小姐的温順的態度，又不禁聯想起上次他回家拿錢的時候的那種暴燥的舉動伊眼睛裏就什麽都看見不淸了，伊心頭就更加抑鬱而且憤恨了。</p>
<p>可是此時的陸先生呢，在丁小姐的心目之中，就像一個幼稚的魔術家在聰明的觀衆面前表演着。已經拆破了秘密的魔術，再也得不到一些可以欣賞的意味了。然而這個魔術家自己是不知道啊，他居然還有看他的新花樣哩</p>
<p>他突然的立了起來，走到了丁小姐的面前，似乎更加柔順地說「今天我有一些事情，想跟你商量一下，祗是好像說不出口」</p>
<p>「什麽事情？」丁小姐冷然地回答。</p>
<p>「有一個親戚，到上海來，因爲家父托他買一些東西，但是他錢帶得太少了，特地來同我商量，恰巧我錢也用得快完了，家裏還没有寄來，所以不得不轉向你設法，請你暫時借一百塊大洋給我，等到明後天，大槪我家裏的錢也得寄來了，那時我立刻就奉還，」陸先生每句話都帶着笑說。</p>
<p>「便利得很－只是我代你去問一個人拿吧　！因爲這時候我自己手頭也不便。」丁小姐也勉强做出不自然的笑，因爲伊明明知道這依然是一套滑稽的魔術啊。</p>
<p>於是伊立起身來，拉了陸先生走向後面的房間裏去。門開了，陸先生突然地捺見發現在眼前的是他的妻子，就像受了一下重重的槌擊。</p>
<p>小榮的妻子一看小榮走了進來，也自耐不住了，立刻就跳上前去，把他一把拉住。</p>
<p>丁小姐却在一旁冷笑着說「陸先生，你要的一百塊大洋，請你問那一位太太商量吧！你看好不好」</p>
<p>陸先生再也不能容忍了，又羞，又氣，把右手用力一推，他的妻子就跌倒在地上了。他大聲地說「你怎麽來的？」</p>
<p>小榮的妻子伏在地上，就大哭起來，伊也萬分憤怒地說「我也正要問你啊！你怎麽來的？」</p>

<h3>紗花纱巿疲憊之主因</h3>
<p>▲世界棉業處不景氣▲國内水災實需不動</p>
<p>紗巿趨勢甚疲、蓋以世界棉業狀况處於不景氣地位、壓力尙重、四方水災日烈、實需無積極之望、故今日各帮交易較昨爲淸、人心又見軟化、惟本月份某廠商以此番十支粗紗生意約有一萬多包、故大批收進巿價上漲、然遠月因棉巿不振、散空抛賣甚踴、前途情形仍不脫疲弱之局不過比較花巿昂一點也、</p>
<p>▲人標近漲遠跌人標前巿開盤、散戶心思仍疲、以外棉又跌、惟榮興號在本月大批收買漲一兩外、遠月漲三四錢午後聞三品紗跌及實銷不暢巿又轉疲、本月跌一錢、遠跌一兩、成交計五萬一千四百包、查賣出恒益一千五百包、賡豐一千三百五十包、益昶三千二百五十包、逹記八百五十包、公泰六百五十包、買進榮興一萬○四百五十包、長豐二千二百包、義餘一千三百包、同興一千六百五十包、兹將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉巿轉疲之由來</h3>
<p>▲國外棉巿潮流有動搖之勢▲各洋行遷就兜售廠商不辦</p>
<p>棉巿漸向軟途、因海外美棉趨勢惡劣、測其狀况又有動搖之勢、故人心驟變、巿氣遂弱、惟買方因金價難小及紗巿良好、均拉緊不放、然各洋行因生産過剩、亟謀出路、在巿極其遷就兜售、然各廠商鑒於世界潮流險惡、皆恐懼不辦、因價格問題、尙未妥洽、棉巿前途、仍須看疲爲多也、</p>
<p>▲漢標回跌漢標前巿開盤、以美棉趨跌、人心較弱、各跌二錢、午後以東洋三品棉花趨跌、巿况又疲、各跌二錢、成交計七萬九千五百担、查賣出利昌二千担、大豐一千五百担、裕康一千八百担、吉豐一千六百担、義餘一千六百担、利亨一千七百担、買進和愼二千一百担、天隆二千四百担協生二千四百担愼昌二千担、兹將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米巿藴伏跌勢</h3>
<p>▲南巿昨日各帮來源仍不少浦存尙夥、城鄉店銷又聞新閘修削、進意頗覺懈細、所以揀取、鮮高稍動、至於客方乃緣内地産價堅昂、均抱守售、是以厚粳行情就吿落定、薄稻積貨稍有、寗胃欠化、本街去化實受松航貨之軋脚、竟稱零星、致價逐削二三角、蘆洋尖被洋米修短、價低角許、陰化貨雖缺少、趨勢更疲、</p>
<p>▲閘北米巿依然毫無神氣、常帮頂貨到銷兩淡、形勢定局、中次兩檔需要尙好、價無漲跌早晚稻及江陰崑山米交易甚淸、價低落二尺、洋蘆尖巿盤高貨爲挻、次色下游、糯米酒戶續辦、故價抬高一二角、新粳昨日抵埠一百担、大盤開出與前相彷、洋米貨缺零星、乃客帮及本街未見擇取、巿形似居軟弱、</p>
<h3>洋米價跌引起客化</h3>
<p>▲北洋帮有試辦▲行情續小近角</p>
<p>昨日洋米巿况仍居疲象、本街有杜米應巿、辦意仍淡、客帮多在觀望中、故上午巿形已見續跌之勢、而欲求急脫之貨主、仍願貶價脫手、行情甩小近角後、始有天津等北洋帮起而試辦、本街亦略爲應酬少許、巿面又轉穏象蓋因自下存數不多、到頭有待、定貨已阻、巿面暫無大跌之局、統巿成交敏　米五百包、價十三元六角、小絞五百包、價三元六角、安南粳五十包、價十五元二角、客秞存貨已罄、昨巿祇汕頭帮去　元三百包、價十三元云、</p>
<h3>洋米定價報跌</h3>
<p>▲六兩半至六兩九錢</p>
<p>日前本巿杜客各米上漲後、本客各帮均爭購洋米、日商又投機定購、産地定價立見一再上升、兼因金價高昂、定貨隨難合划昨日洋商與華商等接安南電報、産地巿價已小、報價一號西貢六兩半六兩六七錢至六兩八九錢不等、而六兩半之兜價已有電報打出、大約明後即有轉云、</p>
<h3>粉巿復趨疲勢</h3>
<p>▲雖有水災但運輸未通▲内地長江帮均事回出</p>
<p>昨日粉巿、上下午開盤後各月份又趨岑寂之象、以洋麥報價、曾小去二角左右、至内地長江帮方面、以月餘來、逐步暢購、數實巨大、今雖災禍連天、無如一片汪洋、水陸之交通、均未回復、即使購辦實貨、亦不能推銷、故該帮心思、均轉懈軟、回出者頗屬不少、觀察前途、或者困實銷之不起、尙須續疲也、結果本月份較前日跌七釐半、九月份跌一分二釐半十·十一月份跌一分十二月份跌一分二釐半、一月份跌五厘云、</p>
<h3>麥巿近疲遠平</h3>
<p>昨日期麥巿面、上下午開盤後、各月份呈近疲遠平之象、本月份因外行回出、巿勢不振、因空方態度甚堅、大部份均預備交貨、九月份亦以漢帮回出、勢呈平疲、十月至十二月份、賣買均屬平衡、一無上落、一月份因買氣甚寂亦見低落、結果八九一月份各跌三分餘未動、現麥巿况、到貨仍不甚暢、廠胃略佳、價與前日相彷、開太倉·崑山·安亭·崇明·外崗·呉淞·浦東麥二千餘包、由福新華豐辦去、</p>
<h3>糖巿劃盤一致步升</h3>
<p>▲棉湖赤開盤頗俏</p>
<p>昨日糖巿産區電訊、古巴現糖價未更動、紐約期糖九·十二月各比前電回升二分、明年三月及五月份各比跌二分、爪哇現期糖仍乏升沉、公會巿塲劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白買氣略活、陳貨十一兩四錢半至五錢、新貨白色者價自十一兩六錢、最高竟升十一兩七錢、巿形尙挺、二十號中砂白喊十一兩一錢、殊少受手、碗靑八兩七錢半、成交數百袋趨勢見定、太古糖又見步升、B嘜十二兩一錢半、HM嘜十一兩五錢至二分半、後巿十一兩五錢半、CW嘜陳貨十二兩、PX嘜十兩○四錢、O嘜九兩四錢、巿象尙穏、號盤有華新號售開現貨陳粗砂白一千袋、價元十一兩四錢半、國貨棉湖赤巿存殊寥、昨開數十包、價升十一兩七錢、巿且穏秀云、</p>
<h3>南北貨蘭谿蜜棗湧到步降</h3>
<p>蘭谿蜜棗、自出新以來、初以貨少、售四十兩、兹以來源逹四百件之譜、價遂步降、昨巿秃秃僅售三十二兩、但今庚出産殊豐、此價尙非低盤、故後巿猶難樂觀、且有續跌之可能也、</p>
<h3>絲茶金華秋蠶孵種順利</h3>
<p>金華舊府屬各巿鄉農民、以今歲春夏二蠶備受天時之損害、蠶本虧折甚巨、大半預備飼育秋蠶、預向省蠶場定購改良種從事孵化、邇來天氣晴暢、風和日暖、頗合蠶事之進行、大帮已收蟻催靑、頗爲順利云、</p>
<h3>針眉珠茶歐銷暢逹</h3>
<p>昨日婺源屯溪等路之針眉秀眉蔴珠蝦目等綠茶、歐莊進意頓趨濃厚、全巿交易頗不寂莫、售盤亦較好二三兩、鳳眉一項頂盤業已開至九十五兩、尤爲近來未有之高價、至珍眉巿面、略趨淸淡、蓋英法行家、鑒於近來漲風猛烈、不得不特緩進態度、以圖壓抑、但華商始終堅硬、巿價與上週仍無上落云、</p>

<h3>五金新鐵貨到湧銷呆</h3>
<p>新鐵貨中如馬口鐵·英鋼板·法西釘·三角鐵·平白鐵·烟皮鐵·新洋元·竹節鋼·等在三四日内、已絡繹裝到有二萬六千餘担之多、一時存貨充塞、致客帮之購辦者莫不裹足不前、所以全巿買賣頗爲淸靜也、</p>

<p>汽車新聞</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>廣泛性之汽車製造業</h3>
<p>— 沛</p>
<p>汽車一物爲近世製造事業中最優良之工藝品。此固盡人而知之矣。其所用之材料。全球各地到處皆有。大有俯拾即是之槪。但此種事實則知之者較鮮。甚者以爲美國汽車事業最發逹。其銷數亦最大。全世界各國均有美製汽車之銷行。乃認爲美國之所以爲汽車製造大本營者。因汽車製造之材料皆産生於美國耳。此說實非。</p>
<p>就事實上言之。汽車製造事業爲一種國際的産生物。其所用製造上之材料。不論何地莫不産之。故全球各國人民。不論直接或間接的依供給汽車製造之材料爲生者。一區之地無戲數千人。故而非洲·亞洲·歐羅巴·亞美利加·大洋洲及遠東各地之森林。礦區。田産工廠等。對於一輛汽車之成就。爲功亦非淺鮮。蓋欲求汽車出品之優美卓越。廣求各種良才殊爲不可少之事也。其他重要礦産加入汽車製造者如次。北美之鋼鐵。加拿大或南美之鋁。智利·非洲及美洲之銅。馬來及玻利維亞之錫。加拿大之鎳等是也。然汽車製造上之所需材料猶不止此。木材橡皮絲綢等無一非必要之品。木材用以建造車身及各項附屬品。大半來自世界各地之森林區。其硬木一項都從美洲中部運來。汽車中製造胎輪及電綫用之橡皮。來自東方各國。羊毛一項製造汽車時所需亦多。常年以若干千磅計。澳洲·阿眞廷及烏拉圭三處。爲此項用品之供給塲所。絲綢大都由日本運往。皮革産自蓄牧之區。澳洲及阿眞廷均産之。石棉由加拿大供給。製造最佳胎輪時常須用富有堅靱性之棉花。此項上等棉花産自埃及。軟木一項來自西班牙。</p>
<p>各種合金及金屬物汽車製造上需用最多咸爲各地之特産物品。錳産自巴西·俄國及印度。鉹爲製造電池之必要物。産自中國及墨西哥。鈕鋼係秘魯之出産物。鎢金産自中國。鉬礦都在北美。水銀一物造車中所用頗多。産自西班牙·意大利·土耳其及墨西哥等處。製造小件精品。及考騐工具等所用之鋼料。精細優美來自瑞士。　在汽車製造業中近來所需甚殷製造合金及金屬板不可或缺。但此種重要金屬祇産南非洲中部之洛諦西亞。再次則爲油漆樹膠。此項大半來自遠東。紐西蘭及熱帶各地亦産之。製油用之亞麻仁來自阿眞廷。此爲漆油時之必需品。粗漆作地之材料大槪來自意大利及西班牙。影陰及淡色等是也。凡上所述均與造車有直接關係者。此外間接用品則不勝枚舉矣。汽油及油類等燃料各國均産之。今日吾等所見之汽車。其製造材料無一非最上等之物品。當其造作之時動作計劃咸爲精功之結晶。其製造程序均有一定之步驟。鑄金作範。造零件。製機械。然後及於車身。最末之一步則爲將各項機件配合。於是一車乃成。其中所經之種種手續莫不以精審出之。故製造之中乃有科學上之各項設備。爲其他各種製造業所不能望其項背者。至其出品之力求精良。造作之力求經濟。又其餘事。今日其結果上所得見者。則其完滿之處有足多也。但製造之術不厭精良。日新月盛其革新改良之處。亦與日俱進無所停止耳。汽車一待造就入巿塲而供人使用。其中亦有一叚浪漫性在若欲細述。亦饒奇趣。所惜過費楮墨耳。今試以一端論。汽車爲代步運輸之品。夫人而知之矣。然當汽車製造完竣之後。出廠以逹巿塲其本身亦必借重運輸。於是火車輪船乃爲不可少之媒介。他如汽車製造材料之供給。來往不息亦無不乞靈於各種轉運之具。故不論直接或間接中。採礦。植林。耕種製造。推銷等各種無窮盡之工作。無一不與汽車有關。而令數十百萬人得有工作。其他則如築路造橋等亦莫不連帶相關泛言之世界各地之出産。各種之人民其與汽車製造業必有若干之相關可言也。至於汽車之用途廣論之有關國計民生。狹言之爲人生日常不可少之必需品。淺言之即稱之爲快樂之製造者。亦無不當之處。故自汽車之發明。人類進化史上亦受莫大之影響汽車一物豈容忽視哉。</p>
<h3>飛霞車之驚人成績影</h3>
<p>不但外觀美麗　且合經濟原理</p>
<p>汽車事業之在今日也。已逹於極盛之時期。惟歐美各國。近來汽車廠之繁多。猶如過江之　。故各廠對於營業方面。競爭頗烈。蓋競爭而落後。則營業前途。即有失敗之堪虞矣。是所以各廠對於車輛之製造。不得不精益求精。以期出品在巿塲之上。得有相當地位。惟近來各廠製車之時。不但外觀要求美麗。且主要目的。在求車輛能合經濟原理。蓋不如是實不足言競爭也。目前各廠出品。能合此種原理。雖有不少。但其中尤以飛霞爲佼佼者也。溯飛霞之在汽車界中。素有相當之信譽。乃一九三○年一年之中。英國各廠所産新車。成績竟以飛霞爲首屈一指。揆其原因。乃係飛霞車輛。問世而後。經幾度長短距離之試車。以及汽車競賽之結果。已證明其不但形式美觀。且在汽車巿塲之上。竟爲最經濟之車輛。是實出人意外者也。</p>
<p>所謂飛霞之能合乎經濟原理者。售價之低廉。物質之優良。此其一也。且車主購得新車而後。一經試用。即可知種種消費。飛霞亦較普通汽車爲節省是故五一四新車問世之後。世界各國購有此種新車者。莫不致函廠方。同聲贊美。足證飛霞新車。其成績實勝人一籌也。譬如有台尼斯登其人者。曾向印度麻特拉斯乘霞分廠購五一四兩人坐新車一輛。一經試用。萬分滿意即致函廠方。說明乘車經過情形。此行路程。計四百三十五哩。且爲高原道路。高出海面七·五○○呎。平均每加倫汽油。可行路三十三哩。適合每基羅米突費油八·五立突。其經濟情形。實爲他車所無與比擬者也。此外米蘭飛霞廠。亦有萬國汽車展覽會秘書羅奇剛德氏投函。述其對於飛霞新車之贊美情形。其函如下。</p>
<p>「余欲投函貴廠者。蓋望貴廠能知余對於飛霞新車之誠意的贊美也。總之。飛霞汽車在小汽車中。確爲最精美之汽車。此實足使其自傲者也。在兩個月中。余曾駕飛霞新車。行路九·○○○基羅米突合五·六○○哩。並用各種速率。行駛於不相同之道路上。不拘高山險峻。平原大道。均曾加以試騐。結果。中途從未發生弊病。且亦並未停頓修車。引擎始終光滑異常。駛行亦因以穏快。實足使人萬分滿意。至於汽油之消費。亦非常經濟。七加倫半汽油。全部可行路一八六哩。」新車成績如何。亦可想而知矣。</p>
<p>飛霞所産車輛。不但五一四號可經濟汽油。即其他各種新車亦然。蓋飛霞近來營業政策。完全集中於提高出品。减低車價。而使車主得經濟一切費用。甚至六缸汽車。亦莫不如此。如印度境内。有巴德遜其人者。購一六缸飛霞五二一Ｃ式轉車。駕駛而後。萬分滿意。嘗謂人曰。當購車之時。車商語我。每加倫汽油。可担保能行路十八至二十英里。事後一經駛行。竟不止此數。每加倫可行二四，八哩。最近廠方且曾語顧客曰。設有人以飛霞汽車。較其他汽車爲不經濟。可來函說明理由。廠方一經接到函件。即可設法將缺點改良。由此足證飛霞之關心經濟問題矣。</p>
<h3>美國汽車業之廣吿競爭</h3>
<p>— 烟雨</p>
<p>今日世界上廣吿術之運用。已爲一般商家所極端重視在商業競爭上。胥賴廣吿爲唯一之戰鬥利器。於是乎各種商業廣吿。亦隨之而日新月異。變化無窮矣。此種現象在美國汽車業中。尤足窺見其一斑。緣年來美國之汽車製造廠家。風起雲湧。盛極一時。實握全世界汽車業之覇權。而同業中廣吿競爭之劇烈。殊令人聞之。駭異不勝焉。</p>
<p>大凡美國之報章雜誌上。關於汽車廠家之廣吿。莫不逐期刋載累篇盈幅。幾家著名報館。如紐約泰晤士報。芝加哥壇報。芝加哥日報等。其全年之汽車廣吿費。爲一筆大宗收入。據稱紐約泰晤士報。去年全年所收之汽車廣吿費。總計在美金五○○·○○元以上。而芝加哥日報。亦有美金三○○·○○○元之譜云。各廠家對於報紙上最優越之汽車廣吿地位。競爭甚烈。每使報館主筆。左右爲難。因不論得罪於任何一方。若一旦决裂。而致廠方停送廣吿。都將使館方收入。大受其影響也。至於雜誌方面。除各種汽車雜誌不計外。其他若暢銷全國之禮拜六週刋等。所載彩色之汽車廣吿。尤爲鮮艶動人。大足喚起人民之購買慾。收效甚宏也。</p>
<p>此外。巿上招貼之效力。亦雅不遜於報紙雜誌是上。雖在窮鄉僻村。各色汽車廣吿。亦觸目皆是。文字圖畫。大都異常生動有趣。每使行人於不知不覺間。駐足而觀在腦海中存留一深刻之影象焉。此項招貼。大小不等泰半用彩色精印。多出著名廣吿作家之手筆。雖所費殊不貲。不顧也。</p>
<p>關於電氣廣吿之運用。邇來益趨普通。紐約百老匯街。夙稱不夜之城。富麗繁華。爲全巿冠。抵晚尤極熱鬧。車龍馬水。有如日晝。以前該處惟福特廠一家。設有一座極偉麗之電氣廣吿。光亦明燦爛。行人側目。今則道奇奥斯汀通用諸廠家。不肯示弱。咸起而傚尤。一時風尙所趨。紛紛在左近出重金租賃廣吿座位。流送最新穎之電氣廣吿。紅綠相映。光芒萬道。星月亦且爲之失色矣。</p>
<p>去年春。福特公司别出心裁。特將汽車製造之經過。及廠内一切情景。攝入影片。義務放映於世界各大都巿之公共機關。此項影片。今歲曾運來上海。歷在滬江大學等處放映。片内所攝一切之情形。都異常明晰。自原料之購置起。直至一輛汽車完成出廠。其間經過種種手續。莫不一一攝入。放映時。並由公司派員蒞塲。隨映</p>

<h3>國製載重汽車</h3>
<p>— 悟非</p>
<p>吾人渴望國内工廠能自製汽車以敵舶來品也久矣。蓋以近二十年來。汽車事業旣日益發逹。而因國人不能自製之故。無論何種車輛。靡不購諸歐美。金錢外溢。已難勝記。且也歐美諸邦。又以遠東爲汽車唯一之推銷巿塲。則吾人日來水陸交通之發展。轉爲彼邦多以暢銷汽車之機會。而竟無一自製汽車之問世。物質方面之毫無進步。能不愧怍。近讀路透社六月十九日藩陽電云。中國自製載重汽車第一輛完成後。此間遼寗兵工廠。舉行慶祝大會。以誌盛典。廠長李君擬將該車送至華北各地。舉行試辦。以廣宣傳等語。不禁爲之欣喜。以有國製載重汽車之第一輛之完成。而開吾華汽車界之新紀元也。惟其載重汽車之製造與其經過情形。則以電文簡略。未能得知其詳。頃閱北京晨報載有關於國製載重汽車第一輛之說明。其事頗趣。其言曰。三年前内戰旣止。遼寗人士。以遼有二大兵工廠。出軍備太多。咸欲以該廠機器。作較有用之工具。此意爲東北當局張學良氏所採用。於是兩廠。遂改爲工廠組織。藩陽大兵工廠。則從事製鋼。出品頗多。不獨供給鐵路之用。即國内亦有極大銷塲。餘一廠。廠長李義俊。則從事於根本偉大之工作。建議該廠宜製載重汽車以應國内需要。並謂中國人咸欲坐汽車。予將使國人明瞭汽車之製法。使彼等坐待。稍得安慰。不致常用外貨。當經張學良氏及東北要人所贊同。並予以七十五萬元爲開辦費。於是開始工作。設一遼寗兵工廠工業製造處。並聘美國著名汽車圖樣家賣亞。另與外國汽車公司接洽。以便購買自己不能製造之機器。經兩年後。第一輛近已完成。關於製造之下列說明頗堪注意「載重汽車完成兩種。一爲ＭcdIe75o一爲ＭcdIeIoo專備中國需求。即爲專備行走不良道路之用。故速度上較爲遲緩。而車輛則較任何外國製造汽車爲巨。各項細目McpIe７５車臺重量三千五百磅。車身重輛一千磅。除去所裝重量四千磅總重八千五百磅。力六一五·匹馬力。平常速度每小時二十五里。最快速度每小時四十四里。輪高一四二寸體長九尺。價目一千零七十金元。McdIeIoo車臺重量四千六百磅。身車重量一千四百磅。除去裝重量六千磅。總重量一萬二千磅。力八十六匹馬力。平常速度每小時二十里。最快速度每小時三十里。輪高一六○寸。體長十一尺。價目二千金元。下列各部。即爲購自外國。（一）機。（二）車胎。（三）電器用品。此外汽車應用之物。均由廠方製造。關於向國外購買者。李廠長云。外國造汽車者。全部汽車用品。亦非全由本國自造。亦須向别國訂買。因中國現當無各項應用物。故不得不向外國購買。渠並謂此後將力求進步。如上述所言Mcdle75o已經完成。且已試車。頗可滿意』云云。觀此所叙。對於自製載重汽車之說明。詳而且盡。以工業衰落之中國。居然亦能有自製載重汽車之出品。毌怪外電競傳。偏載西報也。顧吾尙有欲言者。則以此第一輛之國製汽車。專爲行走不良道路之用耳。苟能推而廣之。進而展之。汽車之出品。繼續不已。而對於國人所需求。方能應付。雖然。藩陽工兵廠附設之民生工廠。新造汽車一輛成功。此爲我國自製之第一輛汽車也。想此後不獨遼廠當陸續製造。以期出品之愈良應用之愈廣。而全國各地廠家。亦當接踵而起。風聲所及。必日見增多。是則對於吾國工業前途。實足稱慶。對於利權。亦有不少之挽回也已。</p>
<h3>廣東各縣興築汽車路近况</h3>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>兩天之後、七月廿三日、我重申前令如下、……假使我軍於這役要臻獲全部勝利、重要的關鍵在於絕不遲緩的向敵痛擊、全部實力應當充分供給第十軍、第十軍應以這些實力集中在其前綫的一部、以便向特别重要的方面、即逹屯拿區域、實行强有力的進攻、第六軍助其右、其餘兵力集中左翼、這擊便可威脅敵軍在困難狀態之下退出逹屯拿南面全部區域、</p>
<p>全部實力調往協助第十軍、第五軍將不免祗有有限的部隊歸其支配、因此第五軍須實行連環戰每戰、須集中全力、更須造成優勢、以爲下一戰的準備、例如、向安克爾河北面高地進展、須造成機會以利向河的南面進攻、向河南進攻又須威脅敵軍退出馬爾納河北面的區域、</p>
<p>在這指揮和加緊進行中的戰事的時候、我不能忽略德軍在别方面迂廻進攻的可能、中歐帝國最高司令爲逃避我軍的大包圍起見、或將調用其後備隊在疴亞斯河之北襲擊英綫以事牽制、我因請貝當司令把退出火綫的疲兵全部重集在法軍左翼的後方以作準備、我並把七月十二日開往沙姆河之南的英軍兩師仍舊調歸海格總指揮支配、</p>
<p>第六和第十兩軍的兵力大都已集中在奥爾克河的兩面、即於七月廿五日開始向奥爾西進攻、一擊大勝、即把奥爾西占領、控制奥爾克河流域的歇爾曼山的東面山坡遂爲我軍、得了一個立脚點、這役把敵軍扼守奥爾克河防綫的希望打消成爲我軍重要的勝利、</p>
<p>次日、德軍實行向河的北面高地退却、退却急速、我軍先頭部隊追擊不上、</p>
<p>廿九日晚、法國第十·第六·和第五各軍、沿着格蘭·樂熟·逹屯拿·西爾奇·列尼綫、在高地的前面停止了、</p>
<p>敵軍在此堅持頑抗、七月卅和卅一兩日、我軍想把他擊破、卒歸無效、塞林奇·塞爾奇·和費勒阿龍諸村落、得而復失、失而復得好幾次敵我兩軍旅進旅退、戰事陷於膠着狀態、</p>
<p>第十軍依據我七月廿五日的指揮和貝當司令七月廿九日的訓令、在八月一日上午四時四十五分鐘、重新進攻、法軍第廿五·第四十一·和第六十八各師、及英軍第卅四師、以坦克砲協助、向格蘭樂熟高地衝鋒、敵軍雖則頑抗得非常厲害、我軍卒以肉博攻占格蘭樂熟·塞文尼·和克利馬意村之間德軍的防綫、這次的决戰威脅德軍重新退却、</p>
<p>八月二日黎明、第十·第六·和第五各軍、見敵已退盡、向晚三軍不折、兵末發一彈進至凡斯爾河之南的高地、沙亞松至此遂奪回、</p>
<p>三日繼續進展、我軍逹到了凡斯爾河左岸、再與敵軍接觸、、前哨在幾處地方渡河</p>
<p>在四日、我軍遇見德軍憑着凡斯爾河固守、且有决不放棄的意思、我軍必須佈置新攻勢和加調新實力綫有破敵的希望、即使如此、也難望立時决勝、况且在這個時候、我軍正在準備另一役重要戰事、就是畢卡特和山特爾之戰、我軍現在的兵額不許我軍担任這役戰事和同時向凡斯河舉行進攻、因令中部預備隊「在凡斯河之南防綫、虚張聲勢、使敵軍得着我軍仍在準備猛攻的印象、」</p>
<p>如此、經過了三星期的交綏、馬爾納河二次大戰、遂吿結束、德軍在七月十五日開戰失利、聯軍即於十八日大舉反攻、連戰皆捷、至今仍占優勢、參戰的隊伍有美·英·意·法各軍、大戰結果頗關重要、聯軍擒獲俘虜三萬人、大砲六百餘門、和機關槍三千架、前綫縮短廿八哩、巴黎歇龍鐵路綫恢復交通、巴黎方面危險盡去、</p>
<p>德軍軍心渙散、我軍軍容大盛、我軍前以逼於敵軍兵額上的優勢、採取守勢四月之久、現今乘機先發制人、改取優勢的反攻、一躍而重執左右這次長期大戰的牛耳、因須火速調集聯軍全部實力、趕在敵人没有恢復元氣之前、乘勝把敵軍殲滅、（未完）</p>

<h3>Continuing Rise of Floodwaters in Wuhan</h3>
<p>Xu Jia Peng and Jiyu Bridge Both Collapse</p>
<p>Sandbags Used to Block Streets in Wuchang</p>
<p>Emergency Relief Society Increases Ferry Services to Maintain Transportation</p>
<p>(Hankou) From the evening of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, the floodwaters in Wuhan continued to rise, causing widespread panic. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Compatriots from Hubei in Beijing, Fang Juehui, Shi Xinjia, and others, telegraphed Hankou, stating that they are organizing a disaster relief association in Beijing. He Chenjun and ten others replied with thanks, also stating, "We regret deeply our failure to prevent the disaster beforehand and our lack of resources to remedy it afterward." (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The dikes at Xu Jia Peng and Jiyu Bridge in Wuchang both collapsed on the morning of the 18th. Water entered the city through Wusheng Gate, reaching depths of six to seven feet. All street entrances are now blocked with sandbags to prevent further flooding. The situation is very serious. The floodwaters in Hankou are also accumulating and deepening. All transportation relies on boats. The Emergency Relief Society has increased the number of charitable ferries, dividing them into four main lines, each with forty large barges and eleven red boats. Branch lines are divided by district by the Public Security Bureau, making travel slightly easier.</p>
<p>(Hankou) Due to the severe flooding, most newspapers have suspended publication one after another. Only the Wuhan Daily and the Central News Agency have persisted in publishing. They are still struggling amidst the floodwaters. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Yangtze River's water level has continued to rise unabated. Since this morning, the water volume has increased further. There is no hope of receding waters within a month. Ships carrying over a thousand dan (石, unit of dry measure) can now navigate the Japanese concession. Motorboats can also travel freely without obstruction. The entire area has become a lake, with almost no trace of land. In the Chinese districts, flooding has lasted for over ten days. Reports of houses collapsing are frequent. With each loud crash, several houses collapse together. The most tragic incident is the collapse of the Jiazi Hotel, Hankou's largest hotel, a five-story building housing over a thousand flood victims. This morning, it suddenly collapsed. Many were injured, and the number of those who fell into the water and died is unknown. The cries of distress were unbearable. Furthermore, the large warehouse of the British Prye-Mander Company also collapsed this morning, resulting in the loss of soda ash worth millions of taels. In short, all that can be heard are the sounds of collapsing houses and cries of despair. All that can be seen are floating corpses. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in centuries. In the Japanese concession, due to excessive flooding, many houses are also on the verge of collapse. (18th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Tens of thousands of Chinese flood victims are using the railway lines as their only refuge. Now, the railway lines have also been flooded for three days, reaching depths of three to two feet. Immersed in the water, they are unable to advance or retreat. Deaths continue to occur, and numerous corpses float nearby. The cries of women and children fill the air, while men are often driven to madness and engage in mutual violence. The horrors of hell could not exceed this. If these flood victims remaining in the water are immersed for another week, deaths will occur one after another until none are left. However, government aid is insufficient, and they are left to remain in the water. Most of the troops are concentrated in Wuhan to assist these dying flood victims. Their only hope lies in the Chinese army, but it is feared that the army will be too late. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Dazhi, the flooding there has reached six feet, and ore cannot be shipped. (18th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Japanese Residents Association authorities, finding the concession turned into a dark world, negotiated with the Chinese Water and Electricity Company to supply about twenty kilowatts of electricity. A contract was concluded this afternoon. Tomorrow night, streetlights in key areas of the Japanese concession will be relit. If there is a surplus, one or two electric lights will also be lit in public buildings. Regarding security in the Japanese concession, the Japanese Consulate General Police Department has decided to install wire fences in key areas of the concession starting tonight. The two streets of Zhong Street and Xiao Zhong Street, which connect with the outside of the concession, will have all traffic cut off from 8:00 PM onwards. (18th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Serious Flood Situation on the River</h3>
<p>Luokou River Water Higher Than Sea Level</p>
<p>Dike Defenses in Shandong Province Telegraph Pleas for Help</p>
<p>Officials and Staff of All Agencies in Counties Along the River</p>
<p>Mobilized Fully, Day and Night, to Rush to the Rescue</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the Luokou River water level is nine zhang (丈, approx. 10 feet) two chi (尺, approx. 1 foot) eight cun (寸, approx. 1 inch) above sea level, only two cun from the danger line. The privately built dikes in Huimin's Tangjia, Lijin's Sunjia, and Pubei's Wangwangzhuang on the northern bank of the lower reaches, and Kangtun and Liuzhuang on the southern bank of the upper reaches, and the Liuyuan on the northern bank of Zhukou are all extremely dangerous and have telegraphed pleas for help. Han telegraphed instructions to the county magistrates, public security chiefs, and river affairs bureau chief Zhang Lianjia of the 22 counties along the river to go to the river immediately to supervise and urge the rescue efforts. Zhang is scheduled to depart today, with the bureau's section chief Zhao Luren taking his place. All staff of the bureau have been working day and night since the 17th. According to veteran river affairs officials, when the Gongba Dam breached ten years ago, the Luokou River water level was nine zhang and five chi high, with a rise of three chi and four liu er (a fractional unit). It is estimated that the water level at Dongluokou will increase to above nine zhang and five chi, and a breach may be unavoidable. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) This afternoon, a dangerous situation occurred in Beidianzi, Changqing County, 40 li (里, approx. 1/3 mile) northwest of the provincial capital on the southern bank of the Yellow River. Several zhang of the stone dam collapsed. River Affairs Bureau Chief Zhang Lianjia rushed to the scene and convened a meeting of village chiefs to discuss rescue efforts. The water level has risen another three cun and has now reached nine zhang and three chi, exceeding the danger line by one cun. The River Affairs Bureau has telegraphed instructions to the county magistrates, public security chiefs, village chiefs, and river workers of all sections and branches of the 22 counties along the river to go to the work sites and participate in the rescue efforts. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) A telegram from Shaanxi states that the Yellow River water level rose a total of six chi, four cun, and six fen er (a fractional unit) on the 30th, 17th, and 3rd. This water is expected to reach this province in twenty days. The provincial and prefectural governments have telegraphed the 22 counties along the river to work with the River Affairs Bureau to take strict precautions. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Results of British Investigation into the Tao Peng Disappearance Case</h3>
<p>No Concrete Evidence Found</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The results of the British investigation into the disappearance of British student Tao Peng have been communicated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in writing: (1) A military police officer surnamed Xia stated that on June 2, after a shootout between Kunshan and a foreign youth, he saw a foreigner arrested. (2) A woman in Kunshan stated that a foreign teenager was arrested, whose appearance was similar to the photograph of Tao Peng shown by the British investigator. (3) A Kunshan street police officer stated that he saw a foreigner on the afternoon of June 2, traveling by car to Suzhou. Another street police officer said that the foreigner claimed to be British. In addition, there is unreasonable evidence, such as rumors of the removal of ears and noses. On that day, in Kunshan, 20 English miles from Shanghai, two Chinese military police officers and a foreigner engaged in a shootout, resulting in one Chinese military police officer being injured and one killed, and the foreign perpetrator being arrested. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Third Note Regarding Korean Affairs Drafted</h3>
<p>To be Discussed at the Central Political Council Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The draft of our third note regarding Korean affairs has been completed and will be submitted after Foreign Minister Wang reviews it. Wang originally planned to return to Nanjing on the morning of the 18th, but because Chiang was in Shanghai, he took the opportunity to discuss the negotiation strategy and stayed in Shanghai for a day. According to sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the morning of the 19th, and the draft note will be submitted to the Political Council on the 19th and sent out after it has been passed. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Total Number of Chinese Nationals Killed in Korea</h3>
<p>Certainly Over Two Hundred</p>
<p>(Nanjing) More than forty corpses of Chinese prisoners were discovered on the Datong River, leading to the knowledge that Wang Rongbao's report that over one hundred residents of Pyongyang were dead was based on a Japanese investigation. Returnees from Korea say that the number of Chinese nationals killed throughout the country should be over two hundred. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Final Accounts for the 19th Year Still Managed by the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The regulations for the final accounts for the 19th year were approved by the State Council on the 18th and submitted to the National Government for promulgation. The Accounting Department stated that the budget for the 19th year was managed by the Ministry of Finance, and the department does not have the files. Therefore, the final accounts should still be managed by the Ministry of Finance. The final accounts for the 20th year will be managed by the Accounting Department. The regulations for the final accounts require all central and local agencies to include detailed reports based on the actual expenditures in the original budget proposal. Expenditures exceeding the budget must state the reasons. All reports must be prepared and submitted within three months.

<h3>Jurisdictional Issues Between the Courts of the Two Shanghai Concessions</h3>
<p>The Division Method is Naturally Cancelled</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that the division of jurisdiction method between the Mixed Court of the International Settlement and the Mixed Court of the French Concession in 1902 was an abnormal system that deviated greatly from ordinary legal principles. The Shanghai Special District Court Agreement signed in the 19th year stated in item two of the annex, "The existing practice of dividing jurisdiction between the existing Chinese trial organs in the International Settlement and the existing trial organs in the French Concession will continue to be handled as before until the Chinese government and the countries concerned determine a method." Article 1 of the "Agreement on the Establishment of Chinese Courts in the French Concession in Shanghai" negotiated this time stipulates, "All relevant regulations and practices shall be repealed." That is, the above-mentioned special method regarding the division of jurisdiction has been included in the repealed list. In addition, item two of the annex to the 19th year agreement originally referred to the existing Chinese trial organs in the International Settlement and the existing trial organs in the French Concession. Now that the trial organs in the French Concession have been changed, this statement should simultaneously lose its effect. Furthermore, regarding this point, when the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed with the French representatives, the French representatives repeatedly stated that the above-mentioned division of jurisdiction method would naturally be abolished upon the establishment of the new court. Our record of proceedings states this on record. Thereafter, the jurisdiction of the courts in the two concessions should be handled entirely in accordance with our country's litigation law. It is specially requested that the Ministry of Judicial Administration order the Second and Third Branch Courts of the Jiangsu Higher Court to inform their subordinates accordingly. The Ministry approved the request, and the order was issued on the 18th. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Proposal for American Flour to Aid Chinese Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Advantages and Disadvantages of the Loan Still Under Consideration</p>
<p>(Nanjing) National Government Advisor Lin Bai, from the United States, wrote to a key figure in the National Government, stating that the flour loan proposal he made earlier would be very beneficial to China given the severity of the water disaster, the lack of food, and the national financial difficulties. Moreover, the United States has had a surplus of flour in recent years, making it cheap. Using it to help China would benefit both sides. If China were to rely solely on issuing public bonds to relieve the disaster, the interest rates would all be above eight percent. If the loan could be established, the interest rate would be no more than three percent. He also said that U.S. Under Secretary of Agriculture Ogding also strongly advocated the implementation of this proposal. It is heard that Ding Youren and others also agree. However, whether it is truly beneficial and without disadvantages still requires the responsible departments to conduct thorough research before a decision can be made. It will only be possible to proceed after Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi return to Beijing. It is also heard that Finance Ministry Advisor Sokulsky will return to China from the United States within a few days. (18th Dispatch)</p>

This was conveyed to the Japanese government by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which began negotiations. The Japanese side repeatedly delayed. Recently, educational circles in the country have separately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Minister Jiang Zuobin, requesting them to promptly urge the Japanese side to resolve the Gengkuan agreement.

<h3>People from All Walks of Life in Peiping Welcome the Triumphant Return of the Soldiers Who Suppressed Shi</h3>

Over five hundred people attended including Zhang Ji, Zhou Dawen, and Shao Wenkai. Zhang Xueliang did not attend due to other engagements, but sent representative Chen Xiaoxiu to participate and express his gratitude. Yu Xizhong and Wang Shuchang were both present. Dong Lin presided over the meeting and gave a speech, stating that at this time when the revolution is in progress, China can no longer tolerate the emergence of warlords. Those who respect public opinion will succeed, and those who violate public opinion will fail. Shi's rebellion was an act of defiance, and Zhang Xueliang respected public opinion and sent troops to suppress it, ensuring peace and security in North China. Today, in addition to expressing our boundless respect, we hope that the spirit of suppressing Shi will be used to unite against foreign aggression. Zhang Ji gave a speech, stating that Shi's rebellion was certainly due to his stupidity, but our unscrupulous neighbors have a great conspiracy against our country. Shi is merely a puppet of the robbers. Yan Xishan did indeed return to Shanxi by Japanese plane, and Shi Yusan fled from Yangjiaogou also by Japanese ship. Such a neighboring country has simply become a robber. We should always shout "Down with imperialism." It is heard that Yan brought back 20 million in foreign debt, which means that Yan is having bad luck. Yan has 50 million in cash, which can be worth up to 100 million at high prices.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Discussion on Basic Issues in Education in the Future (1)</h3>
<p>It is early autumn. The holidays are coming to an end. The authorities of schools at all levels across the country are particularly busy. On the one hand, they are busy with enrollment examinations. On the other hand, they are busy preparing for the start of the school year. Hiring professors, compiling curricula, notifying students, all kinds of preparations to carry out their sacred educational mission are within our expectations. The reporter casually checked the enrollment advertisements of various schools published in yesterday's newspaper and found sixty-five schools. Furthermore, after checking the Beiping Morning Post on August 14, I found thirty-nine schools. Most of these schools publishing advertisements are in Shanghai and Beiping, and there may even be some that have not published them. Extrapolating from this to various provinces and ports, it is undoubtedly true that the number of young people attending school in the next academic year will increase. According to education statistics from the 17th year, there were 19,453 students in universities and specialized schools nationwide, and 234,811 students in secondary schools. Even considering secondary school students alone, there is only one student for every 1,700 people on average. There are over 7 million elementary school students, but more than 35 million school-age children are not in school. According to estimates, the national illiteracy rate is about 80%. From this point of view, regardless of the direction, effectiveness, or results of education, the increase in the number of young people in school, that is, the decrease in the national illiteracy rate, should be a welcome phenomenon.</p>
<p>Although the function of education, in its broadest sense, is the foundation of a nation, and in its smallest sense, it is the key to guiding the national spiritual and practical life towards health and fulfillment. Education bears a great responsibility to young people, and an even greater responsibility to society and the country. However, in reality, has this arduous responsibility been fulfilled in the past? Almost any child can answer this. Precisely because the responsibility of education is great, and precisely because the efficiency of education in the past was low, we must learn from past mistakes and look to the future. Therefore, as the new school year begins and a large number of young people enroll in schools, the reporter respectfully presents several points for the consideration of school authorities:</p>
<p>(1) Is the motivation for enrollment examinations routine, or is there prior planning? Is the purpose of enrollment examinations for the students, for society, or for the school, or even for individuals?</p>
<p>(2) Do the young people who apply for examinations come from all social strata, or is there bias? If there is bias, then education is deformed, and the effectiveness of education is also deformed. Will this deformed phenomenon be allowed to take its natural course, or will efforts be made to remedy it urgently?</p>
<p>(3) When enrolling students today, has consideration been given to the future prospects of the students? That is, after the students graduate in the future, what should they do, what can they do, and what are they able to do in society? Has there been prior consideration of these issues?</p>
<p>Here, the reporter must solemnly declare that the above three points are not directed at individuals. Their purpose is purely to seek improvement in education and increase the effectiveness of education. It is hoped that readers will not misinterpret the intention because of the wording. As for the reasons, I will continue to discuss them later.</p>

<h3>Japanese Militarists Advocate Armed Aggression Against China</h3>
<p>Advocating Increasing Troops in Manchuria and Mongolia to Protect Interests</p>
<p>Issuing a General Order to All Military Attaches in China to Pay Attention to Our Country's Actions</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo News, Since the Minister of the Army, Minami, convened a meeting of division commanders on the 4th of this month, arguments for expanding the military and defending interests in Manchuria and Mongolia by force have stimulated public sentiment. Various troops, local veterans associations, youth leagues, and various nationalist organizations throughout the country have echoed and supported them. The rise of this kind of public opinion is actually due to the military's planned propaganda and advocacy, and the ignorant masses who are obsessed with aggressive militarism have responded to the militarists' advocacy. The impact of this military movement on politics and diplomacy is not insignificant. At the meeting of division commanders, Minister Minami strongly criticized the government authorities and Shidehara diplomacy, saying that those people were outsiders who were not qualified to discuss military affairs. He strongly advocated defending interests in Manchuria and Mongolia by force, so that they could develop. He also said, "The current situation in Manchuria and Mongolia is actually due to the long-term cultivation of exclusionary national sovereignty recovery thinking by the neighboring country, and the development of new economic power, which is by no means a temporary phenomenon, but will be a continuous situation." Recently, all the military attaches of Japanese consulates in various parts of China have been replaced. Minister Minami issued a general order to the newly appointed military attaches stationed in various places to pay close attention to the movements of China. The most noteworthy of these is the argument for increasing troops in Manchuria and Mongolia. As for the details of the plan, it is difficult to obtain. Minister Minami's advocacy of a hegemonic policy towards China, with increasing troops in Manchuria and Mongolia as the top priority, shows that the Japanese militarists' plan for armed aggression against our country is becoming more active. Minister Minami is the most enthusiastic leader, and the people of the country should pay attention to it. (World News Agency)</p>

Therefore, France does not want to receive one less penny of the reparations that Germany should pay, and does not allow the modification of debt and the Treaty of Versailles.</p>

<h3>Yan Moves to White Buddha Hall</h3>
<p>▲ Will Return to Dalian Soon</p>
<p>▲ Preparations Underway for Exchange between Shang and Xu</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Since the defeat at Shibu and the stabilization of the overall situation, there have been many rumors regarding the Shanxi situation due to Yan's return to Shanxi. When Yan first returned, all parties paid close attention, saying that he would cooperate with someone or compromise with someone. Therefore, although Yan repeatedly stated that he was purely returning to his hometown to visit relatives, the society did not believe it. Recently, the atmosphere of so-called compromise and cooperation with someone has gradually disappeared. Yan, when visiting generals, besides advising them to implement unity, rarely expressed other opinions. In the past two or three days, his attitude has become increasingly passive, and he has closed his doors to guests, appearing helpless. A person from the riverside recently said that when Yan first returned, many people went to visit him upon hearing the news, and it was very lively. Yan was also very interested in the reunion after a long separation. Recently, too many visitors have come, in order to avoid harassment and to avoid misunderstandings caused by private socializing, he moved the day before yesterday to the White Buddha Hall in the depths of the mountains more than thirty miles away from the Dingxiang County, and temporarily recuperated. All visitors are uniformly rejected, and several adjutants are sent to stay at the Dingxiang County bus station, where they politely decline visitors halfway and prevent them from going. It is said that Yan plans to return to Dalian in the near future. Judging from the current situation, the future of Shanxi will definitely not be improved by Yan's return. As for the change of chairman, after Xu Yongchang was officially decided by the National Government, all departments of the provincial government are actively preparing for the handover. The members went to Xu's residence yesterday morning to urge him to take office. Secretary-General Li Jingrong also personally went to visit him and asked him to take office as soon as possible so that someone could be responsible for the provincial administration. Xu said that he still had to rush to Pingyi for a trip and ask Deputy Commander Zhang for instructions before he could make a decision, and instructed Li to maintain the status quo temporarily. After Li returned to the government, he immediately convened a temporary meeting of section chiefs to discuss the handover. It is reported that Xu has informally expressed his future administrative policy, saying that on the active side, he plans to first suppress bandits to stabilize the people's hearts, eliminate poisons to eliminate the people's harm, and strictly organize the provincial government and various departments, so that the foundation can be consolidated and jointly responsible for overcoming this difficult time.

<h3>Han Fuqu Sends Troops to Ambush Liu Guitang's Troops</h3>
<p>▲ Xu Tingyao Ordered to Resolve Liu's Troops</p>
<p>▲ Liu Guitang Leads Troops to Hide in the City of Daming</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Commander-in-Chief Chiang recently ordered Xu Tingyao's Fourth Division of the Central Army to rush to Daming to resolve the Liu Guitang's troops, the Provisional Second Brigade stationed around Daming, because Liu Guitang was originally the bandit Liu Hei Qi from southern Shandong, and his troops were all composed of bandits, causing a lot of disturbance. Liu Guitang originally had a unit stationed outside the city of Daming and a unit stationed inside the city of Daming. The unit stationed outside the city, about a thousand cavalrymen, was surrounded and disarmed by Xu's division five days ago. However, Liu Guitang himself led two infantry regiments, about four thousand men, and retreated into the city of Daming, refusing to come out. Liu recently sent a telegram to Jinan to Han Fuqu, asking him to intercede with the central government. Han believed that resolving the troops was a central government order, and that the troops were composed of bandits, so it was not convenient to interfere, and he ignored it. Today (August 16) afternoon, according to Jiang Bocheng, regarding the resolution of Liu Guitang's troops, the central government ordered the Fourth Division to be responsible for handling it. A part of Liu's troops has been resolved, and the rest have retreated into the city of Daming. The central government has sent a telegram to Jinan, ordering Chairman Han to send troops to assist in resolving Liu's troops. Han has ordered Cao Fulin to send an infantry brigade and Li Xuande's cavalry brigade to Daming. It is said that after receiving the order, Cao has arrived in Dezhou from Yucheng and immediately sent Li Hanzhang's Eighty-Fifth Brigade to move. Li's brigade stationed in Dezhou and the unit stationed in Enxian immediately mobilized, taking the road through Xiajin and Weixian to ambush Daming. Li Xuande's cavalry brigade stationed in Guantao also moved to intercept. (August 16)</p>
<h3>Macau Armory Explosion</h3>
<p>▲ All Lights in Macau Extinguished</p>
<p>▲ Many Houses Collapsed</p>
<p>▲ Sixty to Seventy People Killed or Injured</p>
<p>▲ Losses Estimated at Over 300,000</p>
<p>Macau Dispatch: There were originally three Portuguese armories in Macau, one under the Guia Lighthouse, one in Coloane, and one in the harbor. Among them, the armory under the Guia Lighthouse stored a lot of bullets and explosives. Suddenly, at about 5:40 a.m. on the 13th, for unknown reasons, it suddenly exploded. The sound of the explosion was loud and far away, and the shock was extremely strong. The residents on land and water were awakened by it. At the same time, the electric lights were also destroyed by the shock, resulting in a dark world. Moreover, Macau was covered in thick smoke, and it was almost suspected that something had happened in Macau. After the residents woke up, they felt the walls shaking and about to collapse, and many ran to the streets to escape, their cries shaking the sky, which was unbearable to hear. At that time, the ships at sea were moved by the shock, as if in huge waves. Even large ships such as the Quanzhou steamer were shaking. At the same time, the Macau government issued an unexpected alarm, and the residents suspected that it was a military disaster. The embarrassing situation can be imagined. It is reported that when the incident occurred, all of the new houses of the Li family on the Erlonghou Road near the armory, more than ten in total, had several doors and walls collapsed, and some had collapsed completely, resulting in the death of many people. Later, the fire brigade sent a large number of personnel in vehicles and equipment to the rescue. The police station, in addition to sending a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to maintain order, also telegraphed to various districts to send additional police to the scene to assist in the rescue. However, still afraid that it was not enough, more than a hundred soldiers and black soldiers were transferred, carrying iron shovels to the scene to assist in the excavation. The engineer's office also sent engineers to the scene to help. The dead and wounded who were dug out were sent by car to the National Hospital on the hilltop, the White Horse Hospital, and the Kiang Wu Hospital for treatment. The excavation continued until about 12:00 noon before the team returned. It is reported that the number of deaths and injuries is about sixty to seventy. More than ten black soldiers guarding the armory and one clerk were unable to escape and were killed on the spot. As for the new houses of the Li family on Erlonghou Road, the Chinese and Western residents suffered the most injuries. The most tragic of them was the residence of Jian Huanzhang, the former Supervisor of Linhuai Customs and the current Director of the Finance Bureau of Zhongshan County, at No. 37. Jian Huanzhang, his wife Ms. Ma, and his brother Jian Zuan were killed on the spot. Only one person escaped. The corpses of Jian Huanzhang and others have been carried to the hospital for collection by coolies. Zheng Peisheng, a ticket seller for the Qiguan bus, was injured in the head by a flying stone when he passed by the car factory early in the morning to return to work and died on the spot. Huang Jiu, a driver at No. 92 Koka Road, was still in bed when a large stone flew from the tile surface and broke the roof beam, injuring Huang Jiu's hand and mouth on the spot. His wife was also slightly injured. The Jin Yi firecracker shop in Shakang was also hit by stones and the tile surface was smashed. Partner Li Guang was injured in both feet, and his friend Li He was also injured in the head. The Cantonese opera troupe Jue Xiansheng was performing on the Longtian stage and the show had just ended ten minutes before the explosion when a large stone flew to the door outside the courtyard and destroyed a prop box. The tile surface of the stage was also lifted, and mud and tiles flew everywhere. One actor was hit in the head by a tile. The houses near Guia were mostly cracked by the shock, and many Portuguese women and children were injured by tiles and stones. There were also many injured in other streets, and the police detectives are continuously investigating in various hospitals. More than 50% of the glass windows in the streets of the Guia area were shattered, so the streets and lanes were full of glass. Fortunately, the firecracker and gunpowder armory was not affected, otherwise the disaster would have been even worse. As for the wealthy people living on the hillside of Guia, several of them had many treasured antiques, which were also shaken and fell to the ground, resulting in a large number of broken pieces. Therefore, the total loss in Macau is estimated to be around 300,000 yuan. (August 14)</p>
<h3>The Saying of the Opening of the Gold Mine in the Xing'an District</h3>
<p>▲ Exploring Gold Veins Now, Not Talking About Mining</p>
<p>▲ The Saying of Ten Years of British Patent Is Completely Absurd</p>
<p>▲ Zou Zuohua Returns Home Via America After Visiting Austria and England</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Recently, various newspapers in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai have repeatedly published news about the opening of gold mines in North Manchuria and the Xing'an District, and the granting of ten-year and twenty-year British patents. This matter is of great importance to China's mining rights. The reporter specially sent a letter to Gao Renfu, the Tuntian General Office of the Xing'an District (Note: Tuntian Supervisor Zou Zuohua was ordered to go to Europe and the United States to inspect reclamation affairs, and went abroad in May of this year. Gao is acting as the supervisor). After receiving a reply, it is known that someone is spreading rumors. The main points are excerpted as follows, which I think will be welcomed by those who care about mining sovereignty: "I have received your letter and thank you for your instructions. Although the gold mines in our district are rich in reserves, we have not gone through the exploration procedures, so we do not know the quality. This exploration personnel is extremely lacking in the country. Therefore, when our supervisor went abroad, he made an agreement with a gold mining company to conduct exploration on his behalf. It is purely for exploration purposes and does not involve mining or patents. The contract is based on this intention. Unexpectedly, the opponents would abandon the facts, pick up floating words, and attack each other. This is very unfounded. However, such things are not uncommon. Our office has always adhered to the principle of ignoring them. If someone inquires, please explain the facts on our behalf. Right and wrong have their own public opinion, and those who bark at shadows cannot confuse the facts. Our supervisor is currently traveling from Austria to England. After he transfers to the Americas for inspection, he will seek to return."</p>
<p>When Zou Zuohua passed through Tianjin to go abroad this summer, he told reporters that the gold mines in the Xing'an District were very rich in reserves. Although they had been surveyed once, it was difficult to be sure of the total amount of gold veins. This trip plans to recruit experienced mining engineers from Europe and the United States for further detailed exploration. Our country's monetary system is based on silver. At this time of high gold prices, our country's foreign debts and international trade suffer great losses. Our country's red gold has always been used as women's ornaments, and the amount is limited. After the gold price rises, it is purchased and flows into foreign countries. If the gold standard is changed, silver must be used to purchase gold from foreign countries. This loss is even greater. Our country has no such power. Therefore, I strongly advocate opening more gold mines. If the gold mines in the Xing'an District are rich, the mining is proper, and it becomes the source of our country's recoining gold coins, it is also an expected thing. However, it is difficult to achieve great results without strong capital to mine gold mines. The financial resources of the Northeast are limited, and in the future, we hope that domestic wealthy businessmen will invest. During my trip abroad, I passed through Nanyang. In addition to promoting investment in reclamation in the Northeast to overseas Chinese, I also awakened their attention to mining gold mines. Because the overseas Chinese have huge capital and love the motherland, they are willing to invest in domestic production. As for the use of foreign capital to run industries, it is the proposition of the late Prime Minister Sun Yat-sen, but loans should be based on the principle of not damaging sovereignty. However, this matter depends on the future situation. The Northeast is very rich in resources and is coveted by Japan and Russia, who are fighting to seize it. If I do not plan for myself, others will plan for me. I hope that the people of the Northeast and the national experts will pay special attention. From this, it can be proved where the rumor of allowing British patents for ten years originated. (August 15)</p>
<h3>The Excavation of Qian Wencan's Remains</h3>
<p>▲ Only Obtained Bayonets and Clothing, Etc.</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The excavation of Qian Wencan's remains has been recorded in previous news. Yesterday (16th), two Japanese bayonets, a military book, a T-shirt, and a square handkerchief, all of which had been burned, were excavated under the southwest corner wall of the Donglu School. In addition, there were many soda bottles,洋鐵罐, and other items. Although bones have not yet been unearthed, only Qian was harmed at Donglu School at that time. Japanese clothes did not need to be burned at that time. It seems that the clothes belong to Qian. However, the pit where they were burned is six or seven feet long and two or three feet deep. The bones of one person are limited, and it is not easy to find them after burning. This afternoon, they are still continuing the excavation. There is a well in the school, which is waterless and more than thirty feet deep. After the May 3rd Incident, the well was filled. Today, the well is being excavated together, and it has been excavated to more than ten feet deep. According to Ms. Yu Peiyuan, Qian's wife, her late husband not only died for the public, but was also brutally killed by foreigners. This matter concerns national humiliation. Whether or not the remains are obtained is not certain, but all human efforts have been exhausted. The May 3rd Memorial Committee here hosted Qian's wife and others yesterday. Committee member and Education Department Director He Siyuan advocated that if Qian's martyr's remains are found, a memorial monument or tomb should be erected to commemorate him forever. Qian's wife agreed very much, and no longer insisted on transporting him back to his native Jiangsu for burial. (August 17)</p>
<h3>The Water Level of the Canal and the Current Situation of Dike Protection</h3>
<p>▲ Li Mingyang Reports After Inspection</p>
<p>▲ Huai'an and Gaoyou Canal Water Gradually Recedes</p>
<p>Li Mingyang, the commissioner of the Su Province Committee and concurrent security commissioner, went to northern Jiangsu a few days ago to supervise the people of various counties along the canal to protect the dikes. He returned to the province yesterday. According to him, the water level of the canal and the dike protection situation are roughly as follows: Last Sunday (August 11), I was entrusted by the committee and departed for northern Jiangsu on the 12th to inspect the flood and supervise the protection of the dikes. First, I arrived at Yangzi Bridge. The water level was still gentle, but the water height would be level with the dike. Then I arrived at the Shaobo area. The water level was quite dangerous and had risen above the old dike. After continuously adding sand and soil and driving piles to protect it, the project was still good. If the west wind does not rise, it may not overflow. Later, I arrived at Cheluoba and saw that the water level was fierce, like the rushing of sea waves. When I went up to Gaoyou, I received a telephone report in the evening that there was a danger in Huaichengwan. I immediately ordered the rescue first and rushed to the site early on the 13th. I saw that the dike work there was all piled up with sand and mud, which was inevitably easy to collapse. Therefore, the top of the dike was still good, but the back had already collapsed first. Therefore, about one mile of the dike in that place was washed down by the wind and waves by two feet. Later, a crack was found, but it had been protected with sandbags and driving piles, and the work of widening the dike was underway. Twenty miles further up from there, passing through Longwang Temple, all the way to Binying, the dike was very dangerous. When I went there with the workers, I immediately built a dike there to save the emergency. This section of the dike work was all blocked with reeds and willow branches to slow down the water flow and reduce the risk of the dike being washed by the waves. The project above Baoying is considered to be the best in Huai'an, because the local area has a very strict organization, carefully planned measures, and township chiefs supervise the prevention, so the work is very strong. Now, although the water is rising, the river dikes are two and a half or three feet above the water surface. Going up to Qingjiang again, I arrived early on the 14th and went to the first and second gates. I saw that the water had entered several inches, and the banks around the upstream had already overflowed, relying entirely on Pu Ma bags to defend against the water. The water volume of the second gate and the first gate differed by several feet, and there were several leaks. Because the upstream water volume was very large, this place was a bit narrow and it was not easy to discharge, so it was even more critical. As for the prevention methods, all places used sandbags to fill in. The situation was really very dangerous. Whether it was safe or not was still a question. As for the houses on the shore, according to what I saw, some were flooded with only a roof left. The people moved to the river dikes and built tents to live in. When the water rose, they dug soil and drove piles to fill in. If they were washed down, they would go into the sea with the water. The tragic situation was unbearable to imagine. The flood situation this time was really extremely serious. Every time I set off for a county, I gathered people for training and ordered them to be responsible for the protection and to follow the Water Conservancy Bureau's plan. The required manpower should be fully recruited, otherwise, only the county heads of each county would be held accountable. Today, I returned to the province with Director Mao to report to the committee. I still have to go to supervise the dike protection.</p>
<p>The Huaiyi sources of the canal in Jiangsu Province have seen a slight decline. It is known that the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau received a deleted telegram from Provincial Committee Wang Jingtao, Chief Engineer of the Water Conservancy Bureau Pei Yixiang, and others, which briefly stated that Huai'an was sunny and windless yesterday afternoon and this morning, and the water had fallen four inches. In addition, the Gaoyou Works reported in a telegram that the water at Yumatou on the 16th had fallen one inch, with a water storage of one zhang nine feet five inches. Huai'an and Gaoyou are located in the middle of the canal. Since the water has receded in both the upper and lower reaches, it is a good sign. It is hoped that the weather will be sunny for a long time and that the west wind will not rise, so that the excessive water can be discharged smoothly. It is also heard that Director Mao returned to the province from Qingjiang yesterday to visit Director Sun and reported on the river defense affairs. He will return to work this morning.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Second Jiangsu Provincial Congress of Representatives</h3>
<p>▲ First General Assembly on the Morning of the 18th</p>
<p>▲ Two Important Proposals Passed According to the Agenda</p>
<p>▲ Provincial Government Commissioners Report in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 18th) was the fourth day of the Second Jiangsu Provincial Congress of Representatives. The first formal meeting was held at 9:30 AM. The presidium publicly elected Zhang Minquan as chairman. Eighty-seven representatives attended. After the usual formalities, a work report from the Provincial Party Rectification Committee was given. In addition to a thick written copy, Representative Zhang Yuanyang was assigned to explain, stating that the Provincial Party Rectification Committee was ordered to be organized on December 11th of the 18th year (of the Republic), and it has been nearly two years since then. All the work has been compiled into a book, requesting all representatives to carefully examine and correct it, so that the new executive and supervisory committees can learn from it in the future. The two years of work can be divided into three periods. The first period was from its establishment on December 18th of the 18th year to July 31st of the 19th year. At that time, the strength of the party was weak, and the environment was dangerous. The rectification began by rectifying the thoughts and actions of all comrades in the province, with the sole goal of supporting the central government and implementing anti-communism, paying attention to the publicity of the party's correct theories, issuing the "Party Affairs Weekly," and organizing mobile propaganda teams. This was the important work of the first period. The second period was from August 1st of the 19th year to December 31st of the 19th year, focusing on practical work, dealing with matters and not people, first conducting a general survey of party affairs, enriching the internal work of each county, restricting the leave or concurrent positions of committee members and staff, unifying the finances of each county, and then providing district guidance to organize people's organizations, achieving the effect of party-government cooperation. Party districts were also divided, and a work outline and implementation plan for party members were formulated, and the Su-Xu party newspapers were handled. This was the second period. The third period was from January of the 20th year to the present, reorganizing and completing according to the central government's new organization, unifying authority and facilitating work. The party affairs of each county have also achieved great results. The important work was to handle the election of the National Assembly and establish official party headquarters in more than 50 counties, and to prepare for this provincial congress of representatives. In short, the past Provincial Party Rectification Committee has been working according to the law in everything, hoping that in addition to the representatives correcting it, they can properly discuss a plan for the new executive and supervisory committee, so that Jiangsu party affairs will never need to be rectified again in the future. After the report, the Huai'an representative raised questions, requesting Zhang Yuanyang to answer. Then Xu Wenjun stood up and spoke, saying that for the sake of saving time, the questioning representatives should submit their questions in writing to the Provincial Party Rectification Committee for answers. More than twenty people spoke one after another, with proponents and opponents debating for a long time. Chairman Zhang Minquan's voice was quite low, and he could not summarize the representatives' words in the midst of the chaos. Then a certain representative stood up and criticized Zhang, demanding that someone with a correct and loud pronunciation be replaced as chairman. The presidium had no choice but to announce a five-minute break, which brought a little calm. Then Yang Xingqin came out to be the chairman, offering opinions on the questioning matters, first proposing the establishment of an organizational work report review committee, and designating Shen Youguang and Huang Hansheng as reviewers, which was rejected by the public. Then he proposed that when a representative had questions about the work report, they should submit them in writing to the presidium, and submit them to the next meeting, requesting the representatives of the Provincial Party Rectification Committee to answer. This was passed by the majority of representatives. Next, Xu Wenjun, the representative of the proposal review committee, reported that the congress had received many proposals, and the review committee decided to divide them into nine categories: party affairs, administration, finance, education, construction, industry, justice, public security, and others. Each category was reviewed by a committee member, and each item was mimeographed and distributed. After the report, the proposals were discussed: (1) A case to send a telegram of condolence to the soldiers suppressing the bandits (proposed by the Provincial Party Rectification Committee) was passed unanimously without objection. (2) A case to send a telegram of condolence to the overseas Chinese who were victims in Korea, and to request the central government to seriously negotiate the Wanbaoshan incident and the Korean case (proposed by the Provincial Party Rectification Committee) was passed unanimously without objection. (3) The flood in this province is extremely severe, and methods should be urgently sought to provide relief. The representatives contributed many opinions on the outline of the fundamental and symptomatic treatments. It was past noon, and the chairman announced the adjournment.</p>
<p>At 2 PM in the afternoon, the general assembly continued. The agenda was the work reports of the various agencies of the provincial government. Before the meeting began, the entrance of Baoxian Park was filled with cars, as all the department heads below Chairman Ye of the provincial government arrived one after another. Written reports of the work of each agency had already been submitted to the congress. In order to prepare for questions, they all came to the meeting place in person to answer. After the meeting, the presidium elected Ge Jianshi as chairman, and after leading the ceremony, Chairman Ye Chucang of the provincial government first reported, briefly stating that since the establishment of the current provincial government, there has been no barrier between the provincial government and the various departments. He himself also considered himself a responsible chairman, but he felt that it was wrong that he had not been able to make significant achievements in the governance of Jiangsu Province. In this year, the provincial government properly formulated methods for employing people and suppressing bandits. Due to the economic panic, he felt that it was very difficult to provide relief for the current water shortage. After the report, Representative Wang Guoying spoke, hoping that the provincial government would strictly enforce rewards and punishments in the future. Luo Mingya hoped to pay attention to practical local issues. Next, Hu Pu'an, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, reported, with four main points: (1) the appointment of county magistrates, (2) the appointment of district chiefs, (3) the situation of water and land public security, and (4) disaster relief measures. The statement on the appointment of county magistrates lasted for a long time, exceeding the prescribed twenty minutes, so the chairman rang the bell to stop it. Tang Xincheng, the representative of Taixian County, Ma Wenzao of Suqian, Liu Chengrui and Qiu Youzhen of Tongshan all stated the illegal situations of the former or current county magistrates of their respective counties, and Hu agreed to answer them in person. Next, Xu Baoying, the director of the Department of Finance, reported his main points: (1) Since the 19th year, the revenue and expenditure of Jiangsu Province has been about 24 million yuan, but the revenue is very small and the debt is very large. The 20th year is even more difficult, with less revenue and more expenditure. (2) The adjustment of land tax is planned to start with land survey. (3) Eliminate the accumulated abuses of grain books, but without the fish scale register, it is very difficult to do it for a while. (4) The business tax has not achieved much since last year, and the amount collected is still far from the budget. (5) There is a public debt official debt of 7 million, with more than 5 million still owed for construction of 7 million. Jiangsu has always been known as a wealthy area, but in the 20th year, it has reached the point of exhaustion, and the reason is internal turmoil, the Communist Party, and this year's flood. However, he himself is extremely willing to do it with a spirit of great fearlessness. After the report, Representative Liu Youkang raised questions about the surcharges, grain transport, and grain book handling fees. Cai Peifu questioned the Jiangyin Finance Bureau about the deficit in education funds. Hu Chongji requested that the financial bureaus of each county not divert useful funds for other purposes. Next, Chen Hexian, the director of the Department of Education, reported in detail on higher, primary, secondary, and social education, as well as education funds, with the general idea of making young students stable in their studies. After the report, representatives Dai Zhiqiang, Xie Chengyu, and others asked many questions, and Chen agreed to answer them in detail in writing. Next, Sun Hongzhe, the director of the Department of Construction, reported, first describing the changes in the organizational structure of construction administration in the province, and then requesting this year's Grand Canal disaster.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>In the case, the fundamental solution cannot be solved until the Huai River is successfully diverted. Symptomatic treatment is not possible unless the dikes are raised and widened, and all ports connecting to the sea are dredged and opened. At this point, Tang Chou and other representatives from Jiangdu County stood up and questioned a lot, all saying that the construction department should be responsible for this flood and replace the responsible personnel. Sun had not yet had time to answer when the adjournment time was reached. The chairman announced that the work report would continue on the morning of the 19th. He Yushu of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, Li Mingyang of the Security Office, Yao Guozhang of the High Court, and Ni Bi of the Penitentiary, etc., will all attend the report.</p>

<p>Methods for raising construction bonds. The Wu County Government and Finance Bureau have repeatedly received orders from the department, limited to raising 200,000 yuan of construction bonds before the 30th of this month. The heads of the county bureau are quite hesitant about this matter. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and the members of the bond raising committee have consulted once. The members believe that at this time of popular poverty and financial exhaustion, how can such a huge amount of debt be raised? It is proposed to purchase several tens of thousands from the more than 100,000 yuan of construction special funds accumulated in Wu County to meet the urgent need. The county bureau is worried that the Construction Department will not agree, and intends to imitate the Zhenjiang method, collecting two months' rent from residents' shops, and will submit it to the county government meeting for discussion today (the 19th).</p>

<p>The bandit Wang Yaoting was captured. The bandit Wang Yaoting, who repeatedly committed kidnapping cases in various townships of Wuyi, has been wanted by the county government for a long time. The bandit fled to Shanghai and has not been captured. Police Captain Fang Qi recently learned that the bandit had recently sneaked back and was hiding in Xiguan Village, intending to cause trouble. He sent a team to join forces with Ge Qingda, the head of the Fucheng Township Security Regiment, and led the soldiers to capture him in three ways. After the team arrived in Xiguan Village, they saw the bandit escaping to the west of the village and crossing three rivers in a row. The team fired guns and chased him, and finally captured him in the river. He was sent to the security regiment for preliminary trial. On the 17th, he hired a boat to send him to the police team headquarters in the city. Then, because the bandit had confessed to the kidnapping cases he had committed and had two pistols and one rifle, he had recently sent one pistol to Jiang Lian, a member of the First Building outside the West Gate, for storage. Captain Fang immediately sent a team to search, but found nothing. He arrested Jiang Lian and questioned him. He confessed that the pistol had been thrown into the river at the Xidawang Temple. He also sent a team to search, but could not find it due to the deep and wide river. He sent Wang Yaoting and Jiang Lian, along with the confession, to the county and the Anti-Banditry Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Methods for raising local police funds. The Nantong Public Security Bureau's police team has a severe shortage of funds.

The store owner, Wang Jinyu, was sent to the county court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The case of a civil servant enticing a singer in Yangzhou is a sensation. Shen Guinian and his wife, who lived at No. 27, Yongxing Street, Xincheng, were merchants and retired. They had a daughter named Yu Chun, who was twenty-nine years old and famous for her beauty. Because of poverty, Shen hired a teacher to teach his daughter songs and made her a singer in Yangfang Book House, Xinsheng Street, to make a living. Zhao Zhentan, an official of the Finance Bureau, listened to the songs and recognized the girl, and was surprised to find her pleasing. He used his monetary power to become a guest of the family. Zhao's brother-in-law, Bao, went back and forth with Zhao, and became familiar with her day by day. In June, he asked Shen and his wife for their daughter's hand on behalf of Zhao. Shen knew that Zhao already had a wife and refused outright, but Zhao was deeply in love with the girl and instigated her to leave. The girl was undecided. On the first of this month, Zhao went to Shen's house and invited the girl to go to Guanyin Mountain to offer incense, and then brought the girl to the Women's Relief Center. According to the rules, once one enters the center, one cannot leave. Shen Gu knew that Zhao had sisters who were female staff members in the center, and that Bao had resigned as the director of the center not long ago. He suddenly realized that this scene was planned by friends, so he filed a complaint with the county government, shouting for injustice. On the seventh, he received a reply: "It is known that Zhao Zhentan is a civil servant and dares to go out with prostitutes. It is not in line with officialdom. However, the matter of enticing wealth and beauty is within the scope of justice and should be prosecuted in the county court. The Finance Bureau should be ordered to dismiss Zhao Zhentan and send him to the court for interrogation and report. You should know this." After receiving this reply, Shen Gu shouted for injustice in various newspapers in Yangzhou, crying and begging for assistance from all walks of life, hoping to avoid the separation of mother and daughter. He went to Jiangdu County Court to file a criminal lawsuit. The prosecutor of the court has scheduled a hearing for 9 am on the 18th. Unexpectedly, another incident occurred. On the 14th, a "Shen Gu's Solemn Announcement" was published in the Jiangdu Daily under a false name. Shen was even more shocked, so he signed and sealed the announcement and published it in the Business Daily and other newspapers, and distributed flyers, pasted yellow lists, knocked on wooden fish, and shouted for injustice along the street, which led to the expansion of the case and caused a sensation in the society. All parties paid attention to it. Shen Gu also presented the case to the Governor's Office in Suijing because a certain sentence was serving as a consultant in the Office. Yesterday (the 16th), the Governor's Office suspended Bao and sent a team to Bao's residence to recover his badges.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The managers of two newspapers were arrested for continued interrogation. The news about the arrest of the managers of the two newspapers reported yesterday has some discrepancies with the facts and is supplemented as follows. Various newspapers in this city have been suspended for nearly two months due to the change of the director of the poor people's factory and have not yet been published. Yesterday (the 14th), only Zhengyi Daily first printed at the factory. Because of a news item about the police team, Captain Zhang was furious and immediately sent a team to arrest the manager of the newspaper, Hong Shulie. Hong was out, so he was not arrested. The soldiers of the team smashed the signboard of the newspaper office. Later, for some unknown reason, the team suddenly arrested Liu Ruizhi, the manager of the Gaoyou Daily, and Wu Baichuan, the manager of the Huanghua Daily, and detained them at the police team headquarters. Liu and Wu were injured by the soldiers with belts. Magistrate Wang learned of the news and ordered the release of Liu and Wu at 6 pm yesterday. It is now reported that Liu and Wu have filed criminal lawsuits with the county government. Magistrate Wang is currently busy with the Yunyi dike project and has not yet tried the case.</p>
<p>The leader of the embankment privately released the embankment diggers. Two male criminals, Chen Gaoxiang and Zhou Zhaoyou, and one female criminal who stole the embankment of Xiejiayu in this county were arrested a few days ago and handed over to the embankment leaders Ding Yonggao and Yu Haiqing to be sent to the county for legal action. Unexpectedly, the embankment leaders suddenly released the three criminals privately, and the villagers were very angry. Chen Muquan, the head of the township, had already submitted a request to the county government yesterday, ordering the two embankment leaders, Ding and Yu, to hand over the three criminals and deal with them according to the law.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>The verdict on the intimidation case. Xia Zhenwen, the director of Jiaxing Hospital, was invited to Wang's house on Xieqiao Street to treat a disease in June of this year and was intimidated and extorted by the house. Xia designed to escape and reported to the County Public Security Bureau to investigate the bandits. The bandits Qian Yipeng and Wang Zhongxing were arrested at Jiashan Railway Station and sent to the County Anti-Banditry Bureau for interrogation many times. They were ordered to transfer the case to the local branch court for handling. The court summoned the victim Xia Zhenwen and others for interrogation, and filed a public prosecution in accordance with the crime of intimidation. The case has been tried in the trial court many times and was finally declared closed for debate. The sentence was pronounced yesterday, and Qian Yipeng and Wang Zhongxing were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<p>Black stinky bugs were found on the crops. Black stinky bugs have suddenly appeared in the crops of Xinfeng District, Jiaxing, and are seriously harming the rice crops. They were immediately reported to the pest control association for assistance. Zhao Jingcheng, a pest control specialist, was specially dispatched to the district for inspection and collected several bugs to return to Hehe to study pest control methods. The report has been reported to the provincial bureau for joint research on pest control methods so that it can be notified to each district and captured according to law.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Water Poisoning Case: Yesterday, the Xiaoshan East Gate Han Yuanchang copper and tin shop owner's wife, Lou Baozhen, who was accused of attempting to poison her husband, Han Yunsheng, by pouring poison into his teapot, was originally sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment by the county court. However, the prosecutor, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the High Court. Lou Baozhen was escorted to Hangzhou, and after a court hearing and deliberation, the court overturned the original verdict and sentenced her to three years and three months of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Robbery at a Letter Agency: The Quansheng Letter Agency, located in front of the Tianhou Temple in Yongbu, has been in business for many years and its operations have been quite prosperous. On the fifteenth of this month, the agency instructed Chen Anguan and Ying Zhaoliang to hire a boat from Yong to transport letters, packages, and silver dollars worth 700 yuan to Yuyao. At around 7:00 PM, when the boat was passing the Nanhemu area near Xieqian Mountain, six or seven robbers suddenly appeared on another boat, each armed with a handgun. When the two boats were side by side, the robbers jumped onto the boat, fired their guns as a warning, and stole the iron box containing the silver dollars. Lu Ying and the other man returned to Yong on their original boat and have already reported the incident to the detective team, requesting a thorough investigation and arrest of the perpetrators.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Quanqiao Flood Relief Committee</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editors of Shen Bao: Quanqiao has always been known as a barren land, and it has suffered successive years of famine. The scars of hardship have not yet healed, and there is no time for recuperation. At the beginning of the seventh month of this year, there were continuous torrential rains, causing mountain floods to erupt. The streets were flooded to a depth of six to seven feet, or four to five feet in some places. Most of the houses and walls of the common people collapsed, and grain was washed away. People and livestock drowned. The disaster victims had no place to live and no food to eat, and their cries for help were hoarse. All seventy-two weirs in the county were submerged, and the low-lying farmlands were also a vast expanse of water, leaving no hope for the autumn harvest. Subsequently, on the twenty-second day, there was a torrential downpour again, and after two days and nights of continuous rain, the floodwaters had not yet receded when a second devastating flood struck, even worse than the first. Areas near the city, such as Fuan Lane, Hewan, Xingtang Dam, Bai Wangtang, and Jinjia Orchard, were completely submerged. Houses collapsed, stoves were destroyed, and entire families were left without food. The waves were terrifying, and floating corpses were seen everywhere. The cries of mourning echoed in the fields. The lives of the people were left to the torrents of the flood, a scene of utter tragedy. Moreover, the farmlands in various districts were once again flooded, almost completely submerged. During the wind and rain, people were forced to sleep in the mud, and countless people contracted diseases and died. We implore you to publish this situation in the "Letters to the Editor" section and widely disseminate it, and to promote the fundraising and donation of benevolent porridge and righteous grains, for which we will forever be grateful for the kindness of rebirth. Respectfully submitted by the Quanqiao County Flood Relief Committee with seal.</p>

<h3>The Songjiang County Education Association's Appeal for Songjiang Education Funds</h3>
<p>▲Declaration The Songjiang County Education Association declares: Xu Xihuang, the Jiangsu Education County Administrative Investigation Commissioner, based on his subjective opinions and perverse actions, suddenly reduced the Songjiang education funds by more than 37,000 yuan and shut down more than 30 schools. Songjiang education has suddenly suffered a devastating blow, and it is difficult to defend against the blame. Upon investigation, the Songjiang education funds have always had savings and have never been in deficit. Instead of expanding, he is contracting. What is his intention? It is incomprehensible. The association feels deeply that the situation is critical and cannot remain silent. Therefore, meetings were held on July 14th and August 5th, and it was decided to separately submit appeals to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Ministry of Education, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the County Party Headquarters, the County Government, and the County Education Bureau, requesting assistance to maintain the original budget, inherit the legacy of invigorating education, strive for the spirit, and realize the claim so that the purpose can be achieved. This is the declaration.</p>
<p>▲Petition The petition from Tang Zhaoqiu, Chairman of the Songjiang County Education Assembly, to the National Government and other bodies states: "The petition is submitted because the education funds of Songjiang County have been arbitrarily reduced, making it difficult to maintain education. Please rectify the situation." (The petition is submitted jointly with the Songjiang County Government and the Education Bureau, requesting the Provincial Education Department to withdraw its order.) Upon investigation, although the education funds of Songjiang County are not abundant, they are sufficient to maintain education. After the 17th year, the funds for each school were allocated according to the minimum treatment standards of Sun Yat-sen University, and both parties were able to coexist peacefully. However, in the 19th year's budget, the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department suddenly reduced the funds, and the situation has already become difficult. However, due to strict orders, we have endured until now. In the 20th year's budget, after review, the staff of the schools are already complaining. Unexpectedly, the Education Department recently, based on the report of the Investigation Commissioner Xu Xihuang, further reduced the approved budget for the 20th year by a huge amount of 37,000 yuan, accounting for three-tenths of the county's education funds and shutting down more than 30 schools. The state of education is about to collapse. This association cannot sit idly by. Therefore, the first members' assembly was held on July 14th, and it was unanimously decided to separately submit appeals to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Ministry of Education, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Party Headquarters, requesting rectification. Now, we present to the authorities the current state of education in Songjiang and the points where the investigation by Investigator Xu was negligent and did not conform to the facts. The funds for the senior division of elementary schools were calculated at 1,374 yuan per classroom per year according to the budget of the 17th year. In the 19th year's budget, the senior division was calculated at 1,119 yuan per classroom per year for Category A and 1,056 yuan for Category B, a reduction of 255 yuan to 318 yuan. In the approved budget for the 20th year, the senior division was calculated at 1,100 yuan per year for Category A and 978 yuan for Category B, a reduction of 84 yuan to 78 yuan compared to the 19th year and 339 yuan to 396 yuan compared to the 17th year. The junior division also experienced a similar decrease. Recently, according to the order of the Department, based on the report of Investigator Xu, and with reference to his proposed calculation, the senior division will be reduced by another 400 silver dollars per classroom, leaving only 700 yuan. In addition to the salaries of the teachers, there will be nothing left for other allowances and miscellaneous expenses. In the past, the schools in the towns and cities of the junior division were calculated at 24 students per classroom, deducting 48 yuan for tuition fees, and the schools in the rural areas deducted 24 yuan for tuition fees per class. Upon investigation, the amount of tuition fees collected by the junior division is extremely small, and sometimes even nothing is collected, and books and supplies must be given away. Now, Investigator Xu requires that the schools in the towns and cities calculate 35 students per classroom, deducting 70 yuan for tuition fees per year, and the rural areas calculate at 80% discount, with 28 students per classroom and deducting 56 yuan for tuition fees per year. In reality, this is difficult to achieve. In addition, the recurring expenses per class have been reduced by 40 yuan. Those who are clear-headed will be able to see whether this can be maintained. Upon investigation, our Songjiang secondary schools include the Provincial High School, the Provincial Girls' High School, the County High School, the County Normal School, and the Seven County Girls' Normal School. However, the Provincial High School and the Provincial Girls' High School also admit students from other provinces. The County Normal School will only recruit junior high school graduates in the future. The Girls' Normal School will not recruit students every year. Only the County High School can recruit as many students as possible. However, there are more than 400 elementary school graduates in this session, which is already more than the supply. However, Investigator Xu only knows to save funds and does not allow the County High School to open a double track in the first grade according to the established plan, only allowing it to recruit 50 new students, suddenly causing the students to be in danger of losing their education. The intention is difficult to understand. The students in the second grade of the County High School are more than 50 people, and a double class can be set up according to the regulations of the Ministry. Investigator Xu mistakenly counted only 49 people when he inspected, and should have merged them into one class in the 60th year, which is too much of an oversight. The County Training Instructors were originally set up as two people, so that it would be easier to train boys and girls separately, and the effect would be greater. However, Investigator Xu did not understand this and planned to reduce one person, which is not in line with the facts. Upon investigation, although the school buildings of the County Normal School are not spacious enough, adding one grade can be used as much as possible. Although the equipment is not complete, it is being gradually improved year by year. In order to implement teacher training, adapt to local needs, and provide a way out for students, it is appropriate to recruit elementary school graduates. However, Investigator Xu insisted on recruiting junior high school graduates, ignoring the need for normal education and local needs. This can be seen from this. The seven county girls' normal schools are limited to funds and education funds, only half of the other secondary schools, and only five corners of silver dollars per hour. Therefore, more teachers have to be hired to hold concurrent positions. However, the girls' normal schools, with limited funds, set up private classes in addition to public classes to remedy the shortage of teachers. The graduates of each session who serve in various schools have the best results. However, Investigator Xu only sees that there are fewer full-time teachers and criticizes them for resigning. Those with clear minds would never do this. In summary, the investigation by Investigator Xu either ignores the facts or is negligent and sloppy. It is difficult to get through, and it is self-evident. Upon investigation, the main point of Investigator Xu's huge reduction in education funds is that the budget for this year has a deficit of 101,000 yuan. In fact, the education funds of our Songjiang have always had savings and have never been in deficit. Even the newly levied mu tax is not moved without authorization. If it is as Investigator Xu said, why did the Education Bureau not submit a budget requesting a method to be discussed when it was not enough to make ends meet? Why did the Education Department approve it when reviewing the budget? Approval was given first, and reduction was given later. The orders were changed, and there was no way to know where to follow. Investigator Xu also said that the Songjiang collection agencies have a lot of arrears, such as one year's funds, which must be settled after two or three years, so that education funds cannot be received and spent appropriately. However, the funds for Year C, even if they are to be collected in Years D and E, can be collected in Year C for the funds for Years A and B. That is, the funds collected for arrears in Years A and B are used to make up for the arrears in Year C, and so on. There is originally no shortage, and it seems to be in deficit to clear it in one year. Investigator Xu also said that the reason for the deficit in Songjiang education funds is that the clerks are manipulating things, so the method of rectification should be designed from the tax collection aspect. But he does not think about the root and only orders the expenditures of each school to be reduced. If the clerks manipulate things one day and the education funds are completely cut off, will Investigator Xu order all the schools in Songjiang to close down completely? Perverse actions have reached this point. Investigator Xu also said that there is a lot of waste in the funds of each school, and it must be greatly reduced. However, the salaries of the teachers and staff in each school are all paid according to the prescribed amount, and there are receipts for other expenses. The recurring expenses are listed monthly and sent to the Economic Audit Committee for audit. The annual budget has also been approved and reduced. I don't know what the saying of waste refers to. In short, Investigator Xu indulged in his subjective opinions, ignoring the facts, the plan was wrong, and education was destroyed. It is a clear violation of the late Premier Sun's legacy of revitalizing education, a disregard for the National Assembly's proposal to raise salaries, and the fault of dereliction of duty is difficult to defend. This association is in a leading position and cannot bear to see Songjiang education fall into a desperate situation. It has no choice but to present the truth and request the Ministry (Government) to instruct the Education Department to rectify it immediately, so as to create talents and lay the foundation for the country. All the reasons why the education funds of Songjiang have been arbitrarily reduced and are difficult to maintain and Investigator Xu has insisted on his own way and ignored the facts are reported separately. This document is prepared to be submitted to your departments for review and compliance. Respectfully submitted to the National Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Education, the County Government, the County Education Bureau, the County Party Headquarters, the Chairman of the Songjiang County Education Association Members' Assembly, Tang Shaoqiu.</p>
<h3>News on the Preparations for the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society</h3>
<p>The eighth annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society will be held in Ningbo from September 1st to September 7th. It is reported that the preparations for this event have been entrusted by the society to local officials and gentry in Ningbo to handle, and they have been very thorough. It has been learned that the itinerary arranged by the preparatory committee includes tours of famous scenic spots such as Fenghua Xuebao, Tiantong Temple, Yiwang Temple, and Putuo Mountain. The committee has also instructed famous scenic spots and temples to provide accommodation and meals, so that members will not have to make arrangements individually, which would waste time and money. Therefore, the annual meeting fee charged to members this year is five yuan higher than in previous years. The sedan chairs used to visit the four famous scenic spots will also be arranged by the preparatory committee. Members who wish to attend the meeting must notify County Magistrate Chen of Yin County a few days in advance, so that he can arrange the sedan chair fee, which will cost about twelve yuan per person. Accommodation and meals in Ningbo will be arranged by the members themselves. It is reported that the budget prepared by the preparatory committee has been submitted to Ma Yinchu, the president of the society, who is very satisfied. According to Mr. Ma, the total amount of the budget is no more than 3,000 yuan, including sedan chair fees, boat fees, and accommodation and meals for the four famous scenic spots. However, accommodation and meals in Ningbo are arranged by individuals and are not included in the budget. If the society were to handle it itself, it would cost more than 4,000 yuan. It has now been resolved by the board of directors that members attending the meeting will share about 2,000 yuan, and the general office will allocate more than 1,000 yuan. Calculating with 100 people, each person will only pay about 21-22 yuan. All the accommodation, meals, sedan chair fees, boat fees, tips, and public banquets for the four places are included. Compared with individuals traveling on their own, the cost is only one-third, it is said.</p>

<p>(Six to three)</p>
<p>Tawara (Japan) (Six to zero) Whit (England)</p>
<p>(Six to one)</p>
<p>The match between Tawara and Whit was one of the most exciting in the past three days. One was the former Japanese Davis Cup player, and the other was a veteran who had won the Shanghai singles championship for seven consecutive years.

His powerful corner shot took the lead, and Tawara also shot with a powerful force, making four consecutive hits. Whit then lost three consecutive games and then regained one game, tying the score at 3-3, but he was gradually becoming tired. Then in the seventh and eighth games, he was completely defeated, and Tawara won the first set 6-3.</p>
<p>His energy was exhausted in this fierce battle. He hoped to make a last-ditch effort, but after the failure, Whit was already showing signs of fatigue and knew that he could not cope. He lost six consecutive games, and in the second set, he was completely defeated. In this set, Whit knew that his corner shots were not effective, so he tried to lure him with soft shots near the net, but he was unable to get the ball over the net many times due to his weakened arm strength.</p>
<p>Why is it that the diagonal forehand and backhand shots of the two men are rarely accurate? Whit's high and low shots, Tawara will have a way to deal with it, to no avail. And Tawara's fierce chop shot, there is no way to answer. However, Whit's beautiful smashes in the third set also won a lot of applause. Whit only won one game in the sixth game. After watching this game, it is said that if you want to win against Tawara, you cannot just rely on shots, you must focus on strategy.</p>
<h3>Terk, the Old General, Wins Against Machida</h3>
<p>It Was Not Easy to Win After a Big Battle</p>
<p>(Six to three)</p>
<p>(Seven to five)</p>
<p>Terk (England) (One to six) Machida (Japan)</p>
<p>(Six to three)</p>
<p>Although this group was no longer related to winning or losing, the battle was still fierce. Machida's shots are quite skillful, and in one or two years, he will have to be looked at with new eyes. Unfortunately, the shots are not effective, and too many balls hit the net. The first set was fought to 4-3, and the second set was 4-4 and 5-5. Terk only won one game in the fifth game of the third set, which made the old general worry a lot. Japanese tennis is amazing.</p>

<p>▲ Enjoyable Conversation with Madame Sun</p>
<p>▲ Returning to Jiangxi via Nanjing Today</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang of the National Government arrived in Shanghai by special train from Nanjing at 5:30 AM yesterday. He was accompanied only by Chief of the Guard Wang Shihe and over 40 guards. After alighting from the train, Chiang immediately traveled by car to the Song residence on Seymour Road to personally escort the coffin of his mother-in-law, Madame Song, for burial at the International Cemetery. After resting in Shanghai for one night, he is scheduled to return to Nanjing by special train today, and then return to Jiangxi to command the Communist suppression military operations.</p>
<h3>Warship Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>▲ Chairman Chiang Departed from Jiangxi on the Evening of the 16th</p>
<p>On the 16th, Chairman Chiang departed from Jiangxi on the Chu-class warship Qijie. It arrived in Nanjing at 8:45 PM the night before last. He rested briefly at the headquarters and then took a special train to Shanghai at 11:05 PM that night. It safely arrived at the North Station at 5:31 AM yesterday morning. The special train consisted of four cars. It was previously rumored that he would fly to Shanghai, but because the time was still early, he changed to a special train. Therefore, there was much misunderstanding outside. This newspaper had news of Chairman Chiang's arrival in Shanghai by train in both Nanjing and Shanghai, but it was deleted by the inspectors, so it could not be published.</p>
<p>▲ Tight Security: From around 4 AM yesterday, the North Station was heavily guarded by soldiers and police. The security was unusually tight. Moreover, this news was quite secret beforehand. Therefore, only a few people went to the station to welcome him, including Mayor Zhang, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters Xu Jinyuan, Deputy Director Jiang Yi, the two Railway Directors Guo Chengen, and National Government Military Counselor Yang Hu.</p>
<p>▲ Paying Respects to Madame Song: After alighting from the train, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Mayor Zhang, took Xiong Shihui's armored car to the Song residence on Seymour Road at 5:40 AM.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang ▲ Emerging from the Song Residence, Holding the Funeral Rope (Photographed by this newspaper)</h3>
<p>In the hall, he paid his respects to Madame Song's coffin according to Christian rites. When Chiang got out of the car, he was wearing a summer cloth gown, a straw hat, and sunglasses. Although travel-worn and dark-skinned, he was in high spirits. After arriving at the Song residence, he changed into a black cloth robe, black socks, and black shoes. At 6:15 AM, Chiang and Kong Xiangxi, in Kong's car, followed closely behind the hearse. The funeral procession set off from the main gate of the Song residence at 6:30 AM, with Chiang and Kong's car following the hearse directly to the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road.</p>
<p>▲ Lunch at the Kong Residence: The funeral ended at 9:30 AM. Chairman Chiang and his wife, Kong Xiangxi and his wife, Song Qingling, Song Ziwen, Ziliang, and Zian returned to the Kong residence on Avenue Petain at around 10 AM, where they had lunch.</p>
<p>▲ Chiang-Song Meeting: Chairman Chiang and Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, had not seen each other for two years. They met yesterday afternoon and had a pleasant conversation, mentioning various matters. They were particularly united in their desire for peace and national salvation. Madame Sun did not return to her private residence on Rue Moliere until 4:10 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Receiving Guests: After 1 PM yesterday afternoon, Chairman Chiang received several people at the Kong residence, including Vice Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, Chief of Staff of the National Government Zhu Peide, and Mayor Zhang. Foreign Minister Wang and the newly appointed Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin did not visit. Mr. and Mrs. Chiang did not return to their residence on Rue Cardinal Mercier until around 10 PM last night.</p>
<p>▲ Returning to Nanjing Today: Chairman Chiang was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing by night train last night. Over 40 guards had already been sent to the North Station to make arrangements. However, at around 5 PM in the afternoon, the guards were temporarily withdrawn. It was decided that he would stay in Shanghai for one night and return to Nanjing today, before going on to Jiangxi to take command.</p>

The hearse was originally scheduled to depart from the Song residence on Seymour Road at 5 AM, so the participating troops and friends and relatives holding the funeral rope gathered at the Song residence in the early dawn. However, because Chairman Chiang arrived in Shanghai to attend the funeral at 5:40 AM yesterday, the departure was changed to 6:30 AM. No flags or superstitious items were used in the procession.

The Public Security Bureau's motorcycle team and detectives from the patrol room were the vanguards, patrolling the route. The patrol room was personally commanded by the patrol leader. The procession was commanded by Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Huang Renlin of the Lixingshe [Society for Encouragement], with Chen Xizeng, Director of the Public Security Bureau, as the overall commander.</p>

<h3>Madame Song's Funeral, white funeral flags and wreaths adorned the hearse</h3>
<p>▲ Prayer at the Hall: At 9:10 AM, the hearse and troops arrived at the International Cemetery. All troops, except for the bands, rested at the west end of the front gate of the International Cemetery. Then, the undertaker respectfully carried the elegiac scrolls, National Government orders, National Government plaques, etc., to the central hall of the International Cemetery. Workers carried Madame Song's coffin to the center of the hall for temporary placement. The Song brothers and Ailing, Qingling, and Meiling (all three ladies were wearing black cloth qipaos and black veils) and Chairman Chiang, Minister Kong, etc., stood respectfully in front of the coffin. Pastor Jiang Changchuan presided over the ceremony and held a prayer service for about five minutes. After the ceremony, the Song brothers and sisters and Chairman Chiang, etc., went to the inner room to rest. During the prayer, Ailing, Qingling, and Meiling all wept uncontrollably.

<p>▲ Burial: The burial ceremony began at 9:30 AM. The tomb was located to the left of the hall, next to the west side of Mr. Song Yaoru, the father of Minister Song. The grave was five feet deep, with a copper railing on top, tied with leather straps to allow the coffin to be lowered slowly. The bottom of the grave was paved with cement, and the surrounding area was covered with green grass. Ten workers in blue gowns slowly carried the coffin out of the hall. The Song brothers and sisters, Chairman Chiang, Minister Kong, etc., followed behind. After the coffin reached the tomb, it was placed on the pre-set copper frame. Two Republic of China flags were placed on the coffin. After four Westerners from the International Cemetery finished arranging it, Pastor Jiang Changchuan first prayed, and then a Westerner opened the copper railing button, and the straps were slowly lowered, and the coffin also slowly descended. After about three minutes, the Song brothers and sisters, etc., withdrew. Then the craftsmen placed five square stone slabs on top of the grave. After about five minutes, the Song brothers and sisters, Chairman Chiang, Minister Kong, etc., returned to the grave and bowed respectfully three times. After finishing, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Song Meiling, and Yu Fengzhi, accompanied by Song Qingling, and Kong Xiangxi, accompanied by Song Ailing, drove back to the Song residence on Seymour Road, arriving at only around 10 AM. The participating troops and funeral guests also dispersed. Minister Song and his siblings waited until all the guests had left before returning to their residence.</p>

Upon hearing of the passing of Madame Song, Sun, being Madame Song's eldest grandson, specially sent someone to present a funeral couplet, which read, "Only the great lady supported the nation, her noble deeds will stand forever. With all the maternal uncles capable of becoming pillars of the nation, her feminine virtues are radiant." The inscription above reads "Eternal Rest for our Grandmother", and the inscription below reads "Grandson Sun Ke, leading his wife and daughters, respectfully mourns and offers condolences."

<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Submits Measures to Prevent Food Shortages</h3>
<p>▲ Document Submitted to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the recent major floods in various places, believes that future food shortages are likely to pose a danger. Shanghai has a dense population, and temporary measures would be costly and ineffective. In accordance with the Municipal Government's instruction to prepare for grain storage, based on a letter from the Municipal Party Department, it has submitted a report on the reasons for the recent rise in grain prices and the measures taken, along with preventive measures for future food shortages, to the Municipal Government for approval. The original text is transcribed below: "Report on the submission of matters: In accordance with your government's instruction No. 9305, briefly approving the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang's letter forwarding the report of the Fourteenth Branch of the Seventh District Party Department, requesting that grain storage be prepared as soon as possible, we hereby issue an order for prompt investigation and reporting, etc. Upon receipt of this, we have investigated that the recent soaring rice prices are due to two reasons: First, the bad weather has reduced the source; second, the reports of disasters in various provinces have caused public anxiety and uncertainty. At this time of year, when the supply is running low and prices are high, due to rain and scarcity, the price surge is a common phenomenon in this city, but it is not as severe as this time. Since the Food Committee investigators reported on the rising rice prices and the Bean and Rice Industry Association reported that the meeting decided to limit the price to a maximum of 17 yuan per picul, we have been taking precautions. On the 11th of this month, the rice price reached 19.5 yuan, and the price limit set by the rice industry could not be maintained. The next morning, the head of the Fourth Section, Feng Liutang, was sent to Zhabei to explain the origin of the price surge, which was entirely due to weather and public sentiment. If the weather clears and the situation remains calm, the price will not continue to rise. However, the city's grain reserves are not large, unlike in the past. There are few boats arriving from downstream, which is not enough to meet urgent needs. Forcibly suppressing the price may hinder the source, and it is difficult to do in practice. Therefore, four measures were decided: (1) Strictly prohibit underground trading and make market prices public. If there is any underground premium pricing, the bureau will send personnel to secretly investigate at any time and instruct the industry associations to report. Once verified, strict penalties will be imposed. (2) The rice price will be based on 17 yuan, but in this disaster-stricken state, the rice price has actually risen to over 20 yuan. The top-quality粳 rice is temporarily allowed to be priced at 18.9 yuan, and the middle and low grades will be priced accordingly, only allowing for price decreases and not increases. The price must return to a maximum price of 17 yuan per picul within one week. (3) The incoming high-quality rice will be fairly distributed by the industry and must not be released for price gouging. If a rice shop wants to purchase a large quantity, it should be dissuaded. (4) The bureau will forward a letter to the railway bureau to request additional vehicles to transport rice to Shanghai. Rice shops should also limit prices to benefit the citizens. According to the merchants on the scene, everyone agreed and was willing to abide by the decision without any changes. The various rice industry groups in the city have been instructed to comply. In recent days, the weather has cleared and the arrival of rice has gradually increased, and the rice market has gradually fallen by more than two yuan. This is a general summary of the bureau's handling of the recent surge in grain prices. However, the extent and severity of the floods in various places this year are rare in recent decades. Rice-producing provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi have little hope for this year's autumn harvest. The difficulties ahead are unknown. The city has a dense population, frequent demand, and is not a rice-producing area. If we do not take precautions early, the danger will be great once the grain reserves are depleted and the source is cut off. To prevent this, we plan to take advantage of the ongoing fundraising period for the warehouse reserve fund. Your chief will periodically convene the captains of the fundraising teams to urge them to proceed and raise 500,000 yuan in advance for disaster preparedness. This is the first measure. In addition, the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law has already been promulgated and implemented by the central government. Now that the disaster has occurred in various provinces, the city's food supply will inevitably be affected. Preparations must not be delayed. The city has already secured new tax revenues, so we plan to follow the law from this year onwards and set aside 2% of the city's total revenue in advance for storage, specifically for relief from food shortages and other disasters. This is the second measure. Since this year's autumn harvest is hopeless, the shortage of food and the rise in grain prices next year are inevitable. To prevent this, we plan to order 10,000 tons of foreign rice in advance for a considerable period of time. Please arrange for the city treasury to temporarily advance the deposit for this order. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has already borrowed money to implement this measure, so we can follow suit to avoid digging a well when we are thirsty. This is the third measure. Are the above measures appropriate? We are submitting this report along with the recent handling of the rice price surge and a list of the captains of the warehouse reserve fund fundraising committee to your chief for speedy review and implementation." The captains of the warehouse reserve fund fundraising team are Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Hu Mengjia, Wu Zhenxiu, Xu Jiqing, Gu Xinyi, Yuan Ludeng, Yao Zirang, Liu Hongsheng, Shen Lianfang, Yao Mulian, Wang Yansong, Ye Huijun, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Zixiang, Lu Wenshao, Lao Jingxiu, Zhu Wenqi, Sun Baorong, Pan Gongzhan, Tang Naikang, Zhu Hao, Gu Yuguang, Chen Yafu, Chen Tianxi, Pan Hongding, Tang Chengzong, Zhu Zongluo, Yan Enzuo, Hong Lanxiang, Zhu Yinjiang, Li Fusheng, Xu Guannan, Rong Zongjing, Cheng Zhusun, Tang Shoumin, Wu Zhihao, Chen Yiyuan, Lu Bohong, Chen Guangfu, Wu Yunchu, Cai Zengji, Xu Xinliu, Xu Shengchan, Feng Bingnan, Wen Lanting, and Pei Yunqing.</p>
<h3>Chongguang Visited Foreign Minister Wang Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Negotiations on Pending Issues Between China and Japan</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting received Japanese Ambassador Chongguang at 11:30 AM yesterday. The two sides discussed the issue of discrimination against Chinese in Korea and other matters for about 20 minutes before Chongguang departed. A reporter from the Far East News Agency visited Foreign Minister Wang at his office yesterday and asked about the content of today's talks with Chongguang and various issues such as the Korean case. Wang replied that today was the first meeting with Ambassador Chongguang since he was promoted to full ambassador. However, the two sides briefly discussed all pending issues between China and Japan. The third note on the Korean case is currently being drafted and will be issued after he returns to Nanjing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is unaware of the details of the case of Japanese sailors robbing Japanese goods in Shanghai because it has not received a report from the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Flood Relief Association Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Passed the Organizational Outline</p>
<p>▲ Elected Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday at Renji Hall. Over thirty people attended, including Zhang Gongquan, Wu Yunzhai, Wang Binyan, Di Pingzi, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Zhu Yinjiang, Gu Xinyi, and Hu Puan.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Wang Yiting was elected as the temporary chairman. He first reported the purpose of the meeting and described the disaster situation in detail. Then, Hu Puan, representing Lin Wenqin, delivered a very impassioned speech, stating that Jiangsu Province had suffered successive bandit, drought, and locust disasters, and its vitality had not yet recovered. Now, there is another major flood. According to reports, the heavily affected disaster areas have reached more than fifty counties. The disaster is extremely tragic and rarely seen. The provincial government has already made arrangements to deal with the emergency and allocated 39,000 yuan to establish a temporary emergency relief fund. It has now decided to raise another 100,000 yuan, and each committee member will donate three months of their salary, with lower-ranking officials deducting their salaries according to their grade, to contribute as much as they can. However, the disaster area is too large, and it is hoped that major philanthropists will provide more support. As for the one million treasury bond issue, before it was issued, it had already been decided to borrow and allocate funds from the construction bond project for use. However, government bonds cannot be immediately converted into cash, and it is proposed to ask everyone to help sell them. The fund for these government bonds has a custodial institution and is very reliable. Subsequently, it was publicly decided to ask the financial community to pledge loans and philanthropists to consider distributing them. Cheng Jingsheng reported on the process of organizing the relief association. Wu Yunzhai spoke, saying that relief is a way to deal with emergencies, and he hoped that in the future, before disasters occur, the government and local authorities will cooperate in prevention, rather than "clutching at Buddha's feet when disaster strikes". Everyone was moved. Next, the organizational outline was adopted, and standing committee members were elected. There were many other proposals, and after Wen Lanting proposed that they be handled by the standing committee members and not discussed, everyone agreed. Shortly after, a photograph was taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>▲Elected Standing Committee Members Jiangsu Flood Relief Association: Chairman Standing Committee Members: Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Cheng Jingsheng; Standing Committee Members: Wen Lanting, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Gongquan, Wu Yunzhai, Shi Liangcai, Xi Yunsheng, Hu Bijian, Wang Binyan, Zhang Xiaoliang, Lin Kanghou, Jin Houcheng, Weng Yinchu, Lu Bohong</p>
<p>▲Telegram Seeking Relief To all newspapers and charitable organizations: Jiangsu Province is unfortunate to have suffered another serious disaster. The Huai, Yi, and Si rivers are all flooding simultaneously and uncontrollably. In addition, the Yangtze River tide is surging, and the lake waters are roaring. All areas along the Yangtze River, the canal, and the coast, spanning more than a thousand li, cannot escape its poisonous effects. Crops are submerged, and people and animals are washed away. The good fields of the past have now become lakes. The most tragic areas, such as Jiangpu, Huai'an, Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, and Xuzhou, etc., more than twenty counties, the affected victims have nowhere to live and often sleep in the open on higher dikes or climb trees and build nests with wood at the mouths of dikes, swaying in the wind and rain without any way to call for help. Even the higher dikes are broken by the fierce wind, and the precarious nests are incomplete. If they avoid it a little late, they will die immediately. Or the child is already dead and goes into the water with it, and the parents are washed away and martyred at the same time. The sound of crying reaches several li away. Those who barely survive suffer from hunger and cannot bear to scavenge for fish and shrimp. Fish and shrimp are hard to find, so they are followed by other aquatic animals, swallowed alive, regardless of toxic substances. Many people die from poisoning in the following days. If emergency relief is not carried out quickly, more shelters are not set up, dry food is not prepared, and effective relief is not provided, deaths will continue to occur day by day. This will not only damage the nation's vitality, but also, in terms of the supreme virtue of cherishing life and the righteousness of human mutual assistance, how can we bear to remain indifferent and unmoved? Our association has gathered like-minded people to work hard to plan and maintain. We respectfully request people who have a reputation for providing relief to go to the disaster area to try their best to rescue. However, the disaster area is too large, and there are too many victims. Our strength is insufficient, and our heart is surplus, making it difficult to provide universal relief. We humbly hope that your benevolence will be widely bestowed and that you will generously agree to assist. Millions of surviving people will all be grateful for your gift.

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Again Cross the Border to Rob Goods</h3>
<p>Police Intercept Ineffectively</p>
<p>At around 4 PM yesterday, the inspectors of the Zhabei Inspection Department of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association seized four large packages of Japanese yarn on a small cart at the intersection of Yokohama Road and Yinggui Road. They immediately seized it and sent it to the warehouse for safekeeping. Unexpectedly, while traveling near the Commercial Press of Baoshan Road, the Japanese Marines at the end of Douleau Road suddenly dispatched a truck with more than ten soldiers, led by an officer, who rushed to the scene to transport the Japanese goods back. A major dispute arose with the inspectors. The police chief of the Shiqing Road Police Station of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau heard the news and, fearing that it would cause trouble, immediately led experienced police officers to suppress and resolve the situation, intending to send the goods to the district office temporarily. However, the Japanese soldiers were extremely barbaric and forcibly snatched the cotton yarn onto the truck and drove away. The police officers who got on the truck to stop them were all pushed down. It was reported that the Japanese officers were all armed at the time.</p>
<h3>German Ship Sinks the Xin Hailong</h3>
<p>Three People Tragically Drowned</p>
<p>The Xin Hailong, a dredger belonging to the Dredging Bureau, has been dredging the sludge at the mouth of the Bailong Port in the Puxi area opposite Zhanghuabang in Wusong for the past few days, following the orders of the bureau's engineer. The chief of the dredger, Li Jinsheng, had a total of twenty-four people on board, including seventeen machinists, three stokers, one night watchman, and two cooks. The dredger was docked near the Asia Petroleum Company pier a few days ago because the area was a major waterway. Therefore, after dark, three red lights were hung at the front and rear of the ship as a marker to allow other ships to give way. At around 4 AM yesterday morning, when the sky was not yet dawn, everyone on board was lying on the deck because of the hot weather, still in the land of sleep. Unexpectedly, at this time, the Coblenz, a ship belonging to the North German Company, entered the port and sailed to the dredger's mooring place. Due to a slight negligence in navigation, the bow of the ship crashed straight into the dredger. A barge was parked in front of the dredger, and the bow of the ship bore the brunt of the impact and was immediately cut off. The dredger's entire body was made of iron, and its outer barrier was also smashed into a large hole. River water immediately poured in, and the dredger tilted towards the outer barrier and sank to the bottom of the river in an instant. Everyone on board was awakened by the violent tremor, and they were at a loss for a while. Zhou Aisheng, a stoker, saw that the situation was critical and quickly jumped down, shouting for help. However, the dredger sank very quickly, and Zhou did not have time to escape from the deck. Gu Heshang, a machinist, and Pan Agui, a night watchman, also sank to the bottom of the river with the ship and died tragically. The remaining twenty-one people, including Chief Li Jinsheng, heard the news and rushed to take everyone on board the German ship and sent them to Wusong to disembark. After causing the accident, the German merchant ship suffered only minor damage to its bow, but there was no major problem. It then sailed to Shanghai. It is reported that the Xin Hailong dredger was worth more than 300,000 yuan. Chief Li Jinsheng immediately reported to the bureau after the accident. The bureau is now starting to negotiate with the German merchant ship. The deceased Zhou Aisheng was 32 years old, Gu Heshang was 44 years old, and Pan Agui was 35 years old. All were natives of Wusong. Family members were informed of the bad news and were weeping bitterly by the river, which was unbearable to hear. They have already sent representatives to the bureau to request relief and are trying to salvage the bodies. As of yesterday afternoon, the bodies had not yet been recovered.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Flood Causes Huge Losses to Shanghai Financial Circles</h3>
<p>It has been nearly twenty days since the flooding in Hankou, and the water volume has been increasing recently. Except for food, all other transportation has been suspended. The magnitude of the losses in Wuhan and its surrounding towns this time is incalculable and is truly a great tragedy unprecedented in history. According to news from the financial circles of Shanghai yesterday, the various transactions and financial interactions between Shanghai and Hankou are quite considerable. Now that Hankou has suffered such huge losses, Shanghai's financial circles are bearing the brunt of the impact. Therefore, all sectors related to Hankou are currently looking worried.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow is the Anniversary of Liao Zhongkai's Martyrdom</h3>
<p>▲ Municipal Executive Committee Convenes Commemorative Meeting</p>
<p>Tomorrow (20th) is the seventh anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Liao Zhongkai, a pioneer of the Kuomintang. The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department has decided to convene a commemorative meeting at 9 AM tomorrow (20th), gathering people from all walks of life to commemorate the martyrs and encourage the future. All levels of the Municipal Party Department, all agencies, all organizations, and all schools in this city should send four representatives to participate. It is also reported that the rural areas far from the city, such as Pudong, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhenru, will be led by the local party departments on the same day to hold commemorative ceremonies for the local people.</p>
<h3>Important Proposals from Li Zushen of the Flood Relief Emergency Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flood Relief Emergency Committee discussed its course of action the day before. The important proposals of Zhang Zhuping, Huang Yanpei, Hong Yanbin, Chu Huiseng, Wu Zhihao, Yu Daxiong, etc., were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, it has been learned that the proposals of Li Zushen, a standing committee member of the committee, are also quite important and are supplemented as follows: (1) In areas that have not been affected by the disaster or have been lightly affected, the local government should, in conjunction with charitable organizations, investigate wide houses such as temples, shrines, and churches, and estimate the number of people each can accommodate and consult with them to allow compatriots from disaster areas that have been seriously affected to temporarily move to these places. This is a matter of saving lives, and the purpose of religious organizations is to save people, so they will naturally be happy to allow disaster victims to be temporarily resettled. After that, the nearby charitable organizations will be responsible for relief work. Those with a way to make a living will be allowed to find a way to make a living freely. Otherwise, further plans will be made to resettle them in the Northeast, Northwest, and other places to engage in reclamation, and this can also be used to investigate the population and food issues in the interior. (2) Rent large and small civilian boats to quickly go to the disaster area to rescue the disaster victims. For example, the water in Hankou is dozens of feet deep, and the Jiang and Han rivers have merged into one. The disaster victims have no way to escape and are waiting to die, but they cannot fly across the vast ocean. Therefore, rescuing the disaster victims is not only to relieve the immediate urgency, but also to reduce the burden of future relief. As for the shelters after the rescue, the local public security bureau should be responsible for protecting and maintaining order. (3) After the design committee discusses the fundraising work, it will be handed over to the fundraising committee for concrete implementation, and the press should be asked to encourage the public to voluntarily donate according to their ability. No matter how much is raised, it will supplement the failure to distribute donation forms widely. For those who voluntarily donate but have no way to pay, they can follow the example of the method used to raise funds for the Shaanxi disaster in Pingjin, where major newspapers in North China collect donations on behalf of the committee. The major newspapers in Shanghai should be asked to follow suit. If the newspapers are busy and do not have the time, then the committee will send a special commissioner to handle it, and the newspapers will announce the amount of donations every day. (4) The "Moving Troops to Fight the Flood" commentary in the Shen Bao on the 17th is extremely thorough. The committee should follow this principle and send a telegram to the authorities to earnestly adopt the suggestion to use troops other than those for suppressing bandits. (5) The current disaster situation is extremely serious, and the hidden dangers in the future are even more unthinkable. The committee should, based on the righteousness of pleading for the people, appeal to the Guangdong side to end the war as soon as possible, promote national unity, and work together to save this great calamity.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Inferior Goods Should Be Used for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>▲ Proposal of the Seventh District Party Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Seventh District Party Department discussed the case of the Japanese armed robbery of goods and the arrest of inspectors, disrespecting our national sovereignty, at the 28th regular meeting of the Executive Committee yesterday. It was decided to issue a declaration and propose that the confiscated inferior goods should be allocated to the disaster relief association for disaster relief, thereby providing relief to the flood-stricken provinces. It also requested that the central government consult the National Government and issue an order to the construction departments and water conservancy agencies in various provinces and regions to strictly prevent disasters in advance. It was also heard that it was unanimously approved to hire domestic and foreign water conservancy experts to study the fundamental plan for water management and submit it to the Municipal Party Department for review. It was also reported that the Ninth Sub-Department reported that after the expulsion of the witch Cheng Xun, he was hiding in the concession and continuing his witch work, bewitching people's hearts. He had recently presented a petition to the municipal government, hoping to recover the expulsion order so that he could return to Jiangwan and rebuild his power. The authorities should not be fooled, etc. After receiving the report, the committee also decided at the regular meeting yesterday to approve the transfer of the report.</p>

<p>▲ Standing Committee of the Inspection Committee The Japanese Goods Inspection Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its first standing committee meeting yesterday. Those present included Pan Yisan, Zhou Renqing, Shi Jiumao, Yu Yangzhou, Cheng Guichu, Yuan Hongjun, and Qiu Liangyu, etc. Ye Jiaxing chaired the meeting and discussed the following matters: (1) A letter from Yuanlai Store stating that more than 3,000 packages of Dutch potato flour have been seized by the Anti-Japanese Association and requesting that the matter be verified and a letter be sent to release the goods. It was resolved to recommend Gong Jingyan, a representative of the Southern Goods Industry, to investigate and report to the committee for verification.

<p>▲ Anti-Japanese Association Warns Gantai Store The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to Gantai Store yesterday, warning: "Dear Sirs, On August 8, we received your letter stating that the Japanese herbal medicine you purchased was still in Taiwan and had not been shipped. Fearing that the loading application would not be able to release the goods, the Sanda Trading Company specifically issued an official letter to the Consul General in Taipei for certification, requesting accommodation so that the goods could be shipped. After sending personnel to investigate, it was replied that the herbal medicines purchased were two types: pith and dendrobium. Our country's Sichuan and other provinces produce a lot of these and do not need to rely on Taiwan. At this time, the Japanese brutally killed overseas Chinese in Korea. All sectors of the city are facing a national crisis and the end is approaching, so they are strictly implementing economic severance with Japan and fighting for survival. As a fellow countryman, you should be working hard and sharing trials and tribulations together to resist foreign aggression. However, the store is not planning to do this and is shipping Japanese goods, which are abundant in our country, and is willing to be the first to resist the anti-Japanese movement, which is extremely hateful. Furthermore, the Consul General in Taipei does not understand the truth and issued an official letter for certification, requesting accommodation, which is even more shocking. In addition to asking the Consul General in Taipei for details, we are giving you a warning that all ordered Japanese goods are not allowed to be shipped to Shanghai. Otherwise, they will be seized and dealt with severely. We hope you will think carefully and act accordingly, and do not wait until it is too late to regret. This is addressed to Gantai Store."</p>
<p>▲ Letter Questioning the Consul General in Taipei The association also sent a letter to the Consul General in Taipei, stating, "Dear Sirs, On August 8, we received a letter from Gantai Store in this city stating that the Japanese herbal medicine it ordered from Japan was still in Taiwan and had not been shipped. Fearing that the loading application would not be able to release the goods, the Dasan Trading Company specifically issued an official letter to the Consul General in Taipei for certification, requesting accommodation so that the goods could be shipped. After sending personnel to investigate, it was replied that the herbal medicines were two types: pith and dendrobium. Our country's Sichuan and other provinces produce a lot of these and do not need to rely on Taiwan. At a time when compatriots across the country are strictly implementing economic severance with Japan, the store is still reordering Japanese goods, which is extremely wrong. Furthermore, at this time when the Japanese brutally killed overseas Chinese in Korea, all those who hold diplomatic positions should be working hard and leading the people to insist on anti-Japanese resistance and resist foreign aggression. However, your Consul General is not planning to do this and is actually issuing official letters for certification, requesting accommodation for the shipment of Japanese goods, which is truly shocking. Unless you have other intentions, there is no way to explain it. This has been proposed and recorded by the 11th standing committee meeting of the association. In addition to strictly warning Gantai Store that the goods are not allowed to be shipped to Shanghai, a corresponding letter of questioning is prepared. We hope that you will investigate and reply quickly. This is addressed to the Consul General in Taipei."</p>

<h3>Cunning American Youth</h3>
<p>▲ Recklessly Signing Bad Checks</p>
<p>▲ Exposure Occurred on the Ship</p>
<p>▲ Eventually Escaped and Stayed in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, an American youth recently arrived in Shanghai by ship from Honolulu. After the ship sailed, he requested a first-class cabin from the purser, claiming to be a lawyer with an urgent case to handle in Manila, which was why he had made the trip so hastily without purchasing a ticket. The purser provided him with a luxurious cabin, filled out a ticket, and requested payment. The youth signed a check. When he was informed that the company's policy did not allow for accepting checks at that time, he claimed to have no cash. The ship owner then sent a wireless message to the drawee bank, only to find out that the youth not only had no funds but was also being investigated for repeatedly signing bad checks. The ship owner then detained him on the ship and brought him to Shanghai. Upon arriving in Shanghai, the youth claimed to have friends at the consulate who could provide assistance and insisted on going ashore. The ship owner refused, and sent him to the company's ship bound for the United States for deportation. This ship was scheduled to set sail in an hour, and those on both ships thought nothing more would happen. However, after the ship weighed anchor and left the shore, a headcount revealed that the youth had disappeared. The ship owner happened to glance back and saw him climbing ashore via a sampan in the distance. Since the ship had already left the shore, he let the matter go. From then on, the youth began signing checks on a grand scale in Shanghai, buying fashionable clothes, staying at a large Western hotel, and socializing lavishly. Women were particularly fond of associating with him. The banks, seeing the drawee bank's endorsement on his passport, initially accepted his checks. Although they now suspected him, the creditors, thinking him to be a lawyer, dared not report him to the court. These checks have now been sent to the United States and are expected to be returned to Shanghai in a few weeks with "insufficient funds" stamped on them. If the youth reappears at that time, he will be caught in the legal net and imprisoned. It is also rumored that he never set foot in the American Consulate in Shanghai, nor did he visit his friends.</p>
<h3>Manager of Yongxing Exchange Shop Absconds with Huge Sum of Money</h3>
<p>▲ Withdrew an Additional $40,000 Before Fleeing</p>
<p>▲ Arrested After Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Yongxing Exchange Shop in Yingkou, Fengtian Province, was located at No. 6, Jiangxi Road, Sijing Road, Shanghai. Chen Xingwu from Fengtian was appointed as the manager. Since the beginning of this year, Chen had been embezzling funds, totaling more than $6,000. The head office learned of this and was planning to send someone to Shanghai to audit the accounts. Chen, upon hearing this news, secretly issued thirteen exchange bills, cashed them at various banks, and obtained 43,532.36 taels of silver before fleeing. When Liu Xuyuan, sent by the head office, arrived to audit the accounts, Chen had already fled. He reported the matter to the General Police Station. Chinese Detective Wen Da discovered that Chen had entrusted his friend Fan Jiesan to cash three of the exchange bills at the Bank of Communications. Fan was found at No. 365, Ningbo Road, and revealed that Chen was hiding at No. 8, Dabaoli, Avenue Bugeaud, French Concession. The detectives arrested Chen and learned that the embezzled funds had been deposited in various banks, and the deposit books were kept with his friend Zhao Xunting. The police then arrested Zhao and retrieved thirteen bankbooks, including: three accounts with Shanghai Bank, totaling $12,500; five accounts with the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, totaling $33,500; two accounts with the Donglai Bank, totaling $4,000; one account with the National Bank, totaling $4,000; and one account with the Hong Kong National Bank, totaling $5,500, for a total of $59,500. Chen Xingwu, Fan Jiesan, and Zhao Xunting were taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the case and charged Chen Xingwu with embezzlement under Article 357 of the Criminal Code. He requested that Fan and Zhao be temporarily detained but not charged. Chen Xingwu fully confessed. Judge Cheng Shangfeng reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing. Chen Xingwu was detained, while Fan Jiesan and Zhao Xunting were each released on bail of $3,000.</p>

<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Announces Measures for Citizens to Voluntarily Pay Property Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Preferential Fees Will Be Issued</p>
<p>In order to improve the efficiency of property tax collection, the Municipal Finance Bureau has, in addition to continuing to handle matters according to regulations, formulated measures for citizens to voluntarily pay property tax and will issue preferential fees to encourage such payments. This matter has been submitted to and approved by the Municipal Government for trial implementation. It is reported that the bureau has decided to start the trial implementation in the Municipal Southern Tax Collection Office from this winter and will implement it citywide after successful results are achieved. The bureau announced the measures for citizens to voluntarily pay property tax yesterday. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Measures for Citizens to Voluntarily Pay Property Tax (1) All commercial and residential households in the city that voluntarily pay their quarterly property tax to the tax collection office in charge before the 10th of the first month of the quarter will receive a preferential fee of 2% of the amount paid (i.e., $2 per $100). (Note) Regardless of whether it is the owner or the tenant who pays the full amount of property tax to the tax collection office in charge, the entire preferential fee will be enjoyed by the payer. (2) If the payment is made after the deadline specified in the previous article, even if it is a voluntary payment, the right to enjoy the preferential fee will be forfeited. (3) Those who voluntarily pay property tax must pay the owner's donation and the tenant's donation at the same time and present the donation ticket from the previous quarter. After verification, the receipt for the current quarter's property tax will be issued together. (4) The receipt for voluntary property tax payment consists of five copies. The first and second copies will be issued to the payer. The third copy will be the property tax deduction certificate. The fourth copy will be submitted for verification, and the fifth copy will be retained as a record. (Note) When issuing the preferential fee, the payer must sign and affix a seal on the property tax deduction certificate for verification purposes. (5) Households whose property tax is collected by the bureau's collectors at their doorsteps, even if it is before the 10th of the first month of the quarter, will not receive the preferential fee.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipality Standard Clock Damage Compensation Measures</h3>
<p>▲ Regardless of Intentional or Unintentional</p>
<p>▲ Compensation Must Be Made at the Original Price</p>
<p>The electrical standard clocks set up by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities have already begun to be installed. Fifteen clocks in South Shanghai and five clocks in Zhabei will soon be completed and put into use. The bureau has installed these standard clocks in busy city streets to benefit the public, making them easily susceptible to damage. Therefore, it has been approved by the Municipal Government to issue the Shanghai Standard Clock Damage Compensation Measures as follows: 1.

<h3>Closing Soon: Merchant Corps Chinese Company Recruiting Reservists</h3>
<p>▲ Recruiting Will Stop at the End of this Month</p>
<p>Since the 27th class of reservists for the Chinese Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps began recruiting in the summer, the enthusiasm of local Chinese merchants in Shanghai for obtaining application forms from the Chinese Company office at No. B2, Jiujiang Road, and joining the company as reservists has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. It is now reported that the company, as the reservists of this class will be starting classes on schedule to begin training, will stop recruiting at the end of the month.

<h3>French Concession Residents Beware of Impersonators Posing as Detectives to Commit Fraud</h3>
<p>▲ Ask to See Their Licenses at Any Time</p>
<p>▲ Immediately Report to the Police or Detain Them</p>
<p>Recently, unscrupulous individuals have been impersonating detectives from the French Police or agents from the Political Department in the French Concession, breaking into the homes of Chinese residents, and scheming to commit fraud. The French authorities are aware of this and are issuing a clear warning to inform the public. In the future, if such incidents occur, residents may at any time ask to see the detectives' licenses. If they do not have official licenses or it is discovered that they are forged, the residents can immediately report to the nearest police station or detain the individuals and send them to the police station for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Forging Public Works Department Garbage Disposal Certificates</h3>
<p>People's hearts are not as they used to be, and social customs are declining. Fraudulent tricks are becoming increasingly bizarre. Ji Shixiang, a Jiangbei native who lives in Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, is fifty-five years old and has been working in factories. Recently, he suddenly had an idea and colluded with someone named Cai to privately mint a large number of copper tokens engraved with the words "British Concession Public Works Department Health Bureau No.□□ Garbage Disposal Certificate." The tokens were circular, about the size of a large silver dollar. The other day, Ji took several of these copper tokens and told Xu Sihe (48 years old) from Gaoyou and Zhu Lifu (25 years old) from Yancheng, who worked at the Toyota factory, that the Public Works Department Health Office now needed to hire a large number of garbage collectors. His friend Cai had obtained a large number of copper token certificates and if they were willing to take on this role, the monthly salary would be very high, costing a number of dollars per token. Xu and Zhu, hearing this, thought it was better than working in the factory and were naturally happy to do so. They discussed it with each other and, fearing that the copper token was forged by Ji to defraud them, decided to wait until the next day to make a decision. Yesterday, Xu and Zhu took the copper token and went to the Public Works Department Health Office to inquire about its authenticity. The office received the copper token and knew that it was a fake used for extortion. They sent Xu and Zhu to the Harbin Police Station for investigation. The police chief sent Chinese detective Yan Shiqing to transfer Xu and Zhu to the Sixth District Police Station in West Shanghai for questioning. The police station then sent police officers to the address to arrest Ji Shixiang and seized nineteen newly made identical copper tokens. After questioning them separately, District Chief Ren learned that Ji claimed that he did not know that the copper tokens were fake and that Cai had entrusted him with them. He ordered that Ji be temporarily detained for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Business License Exempted from Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Approved by the Ministry of Finance to the National Federation of Commerce</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce yesterday telegraphed to all chambers of commerce in the country that the Hunan Provincial Federation of Commerce had previously sent a letter requesting the transfer of the abolition of stamp tax on business licenses. The federation then telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the withdrawal of the order. On August 15th of this year, the Ministry of Finance issued an approval letter No. 13482 stating: "I have received your telegram. After investigation, the collection of business tax in various provinces was originally determined to issue business licenses, which are the same as the business licenses stipulated in Articles 2, Class 3, Nos. 31, 33, and 34 of the Stamp Tax Regulations. Stamp tax should be collected accordingly. We have approved the tiered stamp tax collection method and ordered compliance. Subsequently, the Business Tax Law was officially promulgated on June 13th of this year. The business license has been changed to a business survey certificate. After detailed interpretation of the legal intent, the certificate permitting merchants to operate has been changed to the basis for public investigation and taxation. It is fundamentally different from the nature of the business license in the regulations, and Article 3 of the same law stipulates that no certificate fee is collected for the business survey certificate, and no tax is collected. Since the method has been changed, the original plan for stamping is difficult to apply. The current business survey certificates are exempt from stamp tax to comply with the law. We have notified the stamp tax bureaus in various provinces to handle the certificates and licenses accordingly. I hereby inform you." The National Federation of Commerce Chairman Lin Kanghou, Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangxu, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, and Peng Chuli. (20) Print</p>

<h3>Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association Urges the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Reclaim the Japanese Concession in Chongqing</h3>
<p>▲ Because the Term of Lease Expired on September 24th</p>
<p>▲ Recently, Japanese Police Committed Assaults Again in Chongqing</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the issue of reclaiming the Japanese Concession in Chongqing, which read: "To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: We have learned that the term of lease for the Japanese Special Administrative Concession in Wangjiatuo, Chongqing, expired on September 24th of this year. Last month, this association telegraphed your ministry, requesting that it be reclaimed as scheduled. However, your ministry has yet to make any indication. Furthermore, according to reports from Chongqing, on [omitted] day of last month, the police officer of the concession, Odazawa, again committed assault while intoxicated, and groundlessly beat Qian Youyu, a worker at the Daxin Iron Factory, causing serious injuries. The people of Chongqing, enraged by righteous indignation, have organized an anti-Japanese assembly and are engaging in economic severance with Japan, and will not cease until the concession is reclaimed. Now, there are only a little over a month left until September 20th. What is your ministry's plan for this concession? Will you permit the Japanese to renew the lease? If so, your ministry's claim to reclaim concessions will lose its meaning. Will you proceed to reclaim it? Why is it that, with the matter imminent, no definite plan has been seen? Will it be indefinitely delayed and shelved like Lushun and Dalian? If this is what is meant by revolutionary diplomacy, then this association dares not obey the order. For the sake of safeguarding national territory and washing away the humiliation of the people of Sichuan, this association does not hesitate to take the liberty of again urging your ministry to implement the foreign policy of this party, respect the declaration of the National Assembly to abolish treaties, and promptly negotiate with the Japanese side to reclaim the concession on time, in order to comfort the hopes of the people of Sichuan. What should be done? We respectfully await your clear instructions. Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association, respectfully."</p>

<h3>Small Things in the World</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>The World's Slowest Breathing Person</p>
<p>All human beings breathe between fifteen and eighteen times per minute. This is generally the case. However, in Baltimore, USA, there is a woman who only breathes three to five times per minute.</p>
<p>Her slow breathing was not noticed at first. Five or six years ago, when she was studying physiology at university, she discovered that her breathing was not as fast as that of her classmates. The degree of slowness broke all previous records. A famous doctor, who had visited twenty cities in Europe and lectured on medicine to 70,000 medical professionals, said that he had never encountered a person who breathed so slowly.</p>
<p>The average person inhales only one pint of air per breath, while this woman can inhale three pints each time. Her lungs are no different from those of an average person, and not larger than others. If she were to go swimming, she could stay underwater for a particularly long time. And when she sings, her voice can be extended for a particularly long time.</p>
<h3>Jasmine Jottings</h3>
<p>— Chen Yiwei</p>
<p>Of the flowers of the four seasons, many are lovely. In this scorching summer, the lotus and water lily excel in their beautiful names, appreciated by poets and hermits, and often found in poems and writings. Among them, the jasmine flower is no less beautiful than other flowers, and its wide use surpasses them all, often seen in new words and phrases.</p>
<p>Jasmine comes from the Western Regions. Its translated name is Yesiming, and it is also named Suxin for its similar species. Later, the pointed-petal species was called Yesiming, and the round-petal species was called Jasmine. The leaves are as large as cups, and the flowers are as small as beans. The color is pure white, and the fragrance is very strong. It is mostly grown in Fujian and Guangdong. Today, the species grown in Fujian are mostly round-petal. In the past, Lu Jia's "Records of a Journey to the South" said that the five grains of Nanyue were tasteless and the hundred flowers were not fragrant, only the jasmine did not change with the water and soil. From this, the value of this flower in the South can be seen.</p>
<p>The method of planting is that spring is the right time, and the soil should be loose, mixed with sand is even better. When the stems are long and the leaves are lush, only water is needed, and no nutrients are required. It can naturally bud and bloom, and its labor is quite economical. Whether planted in pots or in gardens, it can grow. Its benefits are even easier to reap.</p>
<p>It has special advantages among all flowers. All flowers must be inserted in a vase after being picked and nourished with water to bloom and not wither. The jasmine is different. Pick its buds, without connecting the stems, string them with thread, like a string of beads. The flowers bloom and do not wither for several days, or tie them to the handle of a fan. The fan moves and the fragrance is born, refreshing the heart and lungs. Or hang it on a chimney, the fragrance follows the smoke, lingering and fragrant. Or tie it into tassels, knotted in the embroidered couch, so that the land of black sleep becomes a fragrant city. It can also be used as a woman's ornament. Those who have not cut their hair wear it as a hairpin. Those who have cut their hair wear it as a forehead ring, so that the beautiful jade face and the bright flower face reflect each other and are both beautiful. The "Book of Jin" says that the people of the capital wear the Nai flower as a mourning band for the Weaver Girl. In the north, jasmine is called Nai. Thus, the use of jasmine as decoration by women in the north has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>The most extensive source of profit is tea making. Fine and expensive teas, such as Sparrow Tongue and other varieties, are generally scented with jasmine, so that the tea tastes fragrant and delicious. Pick out the remaining ones and bake them into scented tea, so the taste of scented tea is inferior to it. The Nine Miles in Guangzhou is called Flower Field. The Fenggang area in the southern district of Fuzhou is also called Flower Field. Flower pickers take advantage of the faint morning light, when the buds contain dew, and carry baskets and baskets to pick them. Until the setting sun hangs down, the carriers and pickers flock to the market, throwing them into the tea houses for sale. Some villagers specialize in this profit and can earn more than a thousand yuan a year.</p>
<p>People in Fujian often write jasmine as Jili, which is wrong. Mu is alfalfa, which is used to feed cattle and horses. It is not the same species as jasmine. I will attach it at the end to correct the error.</p>
<h3>Visit to Hongzheng Altar</h3>
<p>— Langgan</p>
<p>Humans and ghosts have different interests. The living and the dead have different paths. Confucian scholars do not talk about gods and monsters. Confucius said that he did not know life, how could he know death? The sages still made such remarks, let alone ordinary people. However, there are indeed unbelievable things in the world. Physical laws and common sense are not always sufficient. However, the facts are clear and the miracles are obvious, which are what people do not want to believe but have to believe. Automatic writing is one of them. My friend Xie Junwenrong has always been a theist and is a firm believer in this path. He is a disciple of Hongzheng Altar and often tells me about the spiritual efficacy of automatic writing, firmly inviting me to watch and prove that his words are not false. So last week, I accompanied Sun Jun to visit the altar. The altar is located in Qingxiang Lane, Jielu, a very narrow place. Climbing the stairs, turning several times, we reached the room. The incense smoke was swirling, and the people wanted to choke. The walls were hung with portraits of gods and automatic writing. The portraits of Ji Gong and Chunyang had clear features and were clearly recognizable, said to have been taken from space. This is one strange thing. We sat for about half an hour, and then the automatic writing began. The people in the room all held their breath and waited, very devout. At first, countless circles were drawn in the sand tray, not forming words. Then the hands of the one holding the planchette moved greatly, and gradually they could be recognized. Today happened to be the birthday of the Goddess of Mercy. All the gods and immortals went to celebrate. The altar master Ji Gong was not back from the South China Sea. The words "Keeping the Altar with an Inch of Incense" appeared in the sand tray, instructing us to wait a little longer and then try again. So everyone retreated to rest. First, my companions and I made an agreement with Xie Jun that we should ask the god about our fortune and misfortune, so as to divine our fate. Jun then asked the person in charge to take a yellow slip and write down our names and the matters we wanted to ask about. My two companions and I each wrote one, asking about our lifelong fortune and misfortune, and asking the god to give us a poem. Both yellow slips were placed on the altar table. After an inch of incense had passed, we reopened the table. At this time, the altar master Ji Gong also returned. After writing about twenty or thirty words, he addressed the matters we had asked about. Staring at the sand tray, the strokes danced like dragons and snakes, and could not be read to the end. The one holding the planchette would make a word with his hand, then call it out and order the recorder to write it down. After it was finished, we looked at it. The first and second lines were all six characters, and the third line was seven characters. Moreover, it was a poem given to both of us. The original text said: "Miao miao zhun er guo, wu yu tui chu chuang men. Yi shi xia yu su lin tou, qie dai he shi zi zu". What exactly is the meaning of this? After thinking hard, I could not understand it. I was very confused. A few days ago, I met Mr. Ding Zhonghu, a recluse in the fields, and asked him about automatic writing. The gentleman said bluntly, "I dare not say that Ji Gong and Chunyang exist. I dare not say that the theory of the soul is necessarily absent." He then told me about the story of Mr. Hu Junyanfu in "Common Talk Series." Hu Junyanfu taught in a private school at home. One day, a guest arrived. He was about to send someone to buy food for the guest. He made a list of items on paper, but when he started writing, he felt that the strokes were horizontal and vertical, and he could not write as he wanted. He was very frightened, thinking that he was sick. But when he put down the pen, his hand was normal, and there was no pain. When he picked up the pen again, it was as before. The guest said, "This is probably automatic writing." I have seen the state of those who practice automatic writing, and it is exactly like this. Gu Jun has never practiced automatic writing and does not believe it. At that time, several Confucian scholars of the clan gathered together and taught him to hold the pen loosely and write at will. Then the characters were as big as bowls, skewed, clumsy, and rough. When they looked at them, they recognized the three characters "Zeng Zigu". Everyone was surprised and said that Mr. Nanfeng had come. So they burned incense and paid their respects, asking him to write a poem. He refused, saying that he was unable to. They sighed in regret. People said that Nanfeng was good at prose but short on poetry, which was not false. Then they asked him about the works recorded in the collection. He also refused, saying that he had forgotten them all for a long time. Everyone was already suspicious. That day happened to be the spring festival, so they took it as the subject and forced him to write a poem. He wrote a five-character quatrain, which was very vulgar. They asked if he could make art, and he said he could. They pointed to the topic of the day and asked him to try, but he could not write smoothly. Everyone laughed and stopped. The next day, holding the pen was as before, but the characters were slightly more correct. He wrote a brief narrative as he had done at first. They asked if he was still Zigu, and he said no. The one who came yesterday was an impersonator. He was a certain villager who had given up his career early. As for me, I was a student of the Imperial College in the world. I had learned the Eight-Part Essay and completed an article. He also told them his residence and name in great detail. Everyone knew that it was a ghost. Compared to the one who came yesterday, his writing was slightly more understandable. When asked about things, his answers were also in line with people's expectations, and there was nothing strange. He came as soon as he picked up the pen, and his words were trivial. I was tired and thanked him. However, he still came from time to time. One night, lying in bed, his hands were shaking. Jun was deeply worried about being disturbed, and the family members were even more frightened when they heard about it. They quickly moved the bed home and moved the museum. Since then, it has stopped. There was nothing else after that.</p>
<h3>The World's Richest Man</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>The Indian Nizam has assets of 1 billion US dollars, making him the richest man in the world. His 1 billion dollars are mostly in jewelry and gold. This huge fortune is not stored in a secure bank vault but is hidden at home. He resides in Hyderabad, a remote and wild area. To ensure the safety of his treasures, he built a city wall around his house, with well-trained and strong men guarding it, and heavy cannons and sharp guns. The place is as solid as a golden pond, and thieves and robbers cannot even get a glimpse of it. The Nizam is extremely stingy and does not donate to any charitable causes. However, he often gives servants thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars during the holidays. People find this strange. He also told people, "I can dispose of my property according to my free will. If my son is like me, I will give it to him. If he is not what I love, then I will give it to the world. It can be scattered in an instant. Now I still have the ability to protect it. Heaven has given me a huge fortune, and I must fulfill my responsibility to protect it. If I have the ability to protect it but entrust it to others, I am failing Heaven. If I do not have the ability to protect it but do not entrust it to those who can bear this responsibility, I am also failing Heaven. Therefore, my responsibility to protect it cannot be removed now. Even if it is removed, I have not found someone to entrust it to." Today's commentators on respecting property say that property should be used as much as possible for the purpose of creating wealth and benefiting society, the country, and the people. The Nizam's words and deeds are contrary to this. It is also said that the wealth of the world is mainly in the United States, and the most millionaires are also in the United States. However, even the four richest people in the United States, such as Ford, each have only 500 to 600 million dollars, so they are not comparable to the Nizam. This is why the Nizam is the richest man in the world.</p>
<h3>Travels in India (84)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The national movement of the Indian people began in 1889. However, it was only able to make reports to the government. It was not until after the Russo-Japanese War from 1909 to 1911 that the Indians realized that the small Asians could defeat the large European powers, let alone the large India. After the Chinese Revolution, the Indians were determined to start an uprising. The Gandhi movement has been going on for more than 20 years, and its effectiveness has been in recent months. The progress in recent months has been greater than in the previous 20 years. The senior officials are all British. The middle-level officials with power are also British, interspersed with idle positions belonging to the Indians. The real power of the lower-level officials still belongs to the British. Only the police belong to the Indians. The British spend 600 million rupees a year on raising troops. However, the British troops are not visible in peacetime, to show their civilization and generosity. Once something happens, they arrive like a storm, to show their unpredictability. They are mostly stationed in the north to defend against China and Russia. The Indians are like sheep and have no defense to speak of.</p>
<p>Indian geography is roughly divided into three parts. One is the Himalayan Mountains, which is a cold region in the far north. Its inhabitants are very dense, close to Chinese Tibet. Indians also call Tibet China. The second is the Ganges River Basin, from Calcutta to Lahore. The Ganges River Basin is a land of political, religious, rich, and strong people, and is also the center of people. The third is the desert south of the Ganges River, the southern Indian provinces.</p>
<p>The old people, students, children, ladies, and monks I met all liked to hear about Chinese affairs and liked to come to China. I don't know why. I feel that everything has a natural opportunity. When the opportunity arrives, it is beyond human control. The feeling of India towards China has several reasons. One is due to external pressure, so they think of sympathizing with those who show sympathy for them. They know that the Buddha left India and went to China, and China is their first sympathetic friend. It is a large country with a large population and no ambitions. They feel that Japan, China, and Siam are all Buddhist countries, and Japan is strong, so they sigh and miss China and love the Chinese. Because the Chinese spread Indian culture to the world, and also act as the host of India. These feelings arise spontaneously. The British suppress us, and the Chinese bathe in the grace of the Heavenly Abode and are liberated in body and mind, eliminating our many disasters. The country has been peaceful and the people have been safe for thousands of years. Now they know that they should repay their kindness, which is their duty. If the Indians can come, they should be greeted with flowers and music. The Buddhist societies and monasteries in various places are all their combined halls. In the past, Tagore asked me for the fruits of the old trees for thousands of years. Now is the time. China is the crown of Asian culture. Support India, revive the Jews, unite the Muslims, revive Siam, and destroy all differences to win the hearts of the world. Is this not the duty of the Chinese nation in the 20th century?</p>
<p>Rotary Club Speech</p>
<h3>Women, Women (24)</h3>
<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>Little Rong's wife was in the back room, and had long heard her husband come in. The fire in her heart could no longer be suppressed. She was about to jump out and question him, but Qiu Zi persuaded her. She also remembered what Miss Ding had told her earlier, and had to endure the anger in her stomach, and remained there.</p>
<p>However, from the crack in the door, she saw her husband's gentle attitude towards Miss Ding, and couldn't help but think of his violent behavior the last time he came home to get money. Her eyes could no longer see anything clearly, and her heart became even more depressed and resentful.</p>
<p>But at this time, in Miss Ding's mind, Mr. Lu was like a naive magician performing in front of a smart audience. The magic that had been exposed no longer had any appreciation. However, this magician himself did not know it, and he even thought there were people still watching his new tricks.</p>
<p>He suddenly stood up, walked to Miss Ding, and said even more softly, "I have some things today that I want to discuss with you, but I can't seem to say them."</p>
<p>"What is it?" Miss Ding replied coldly.</p>
<p>"A relative came to Shanghai, because my father asked him to buy some things, but he didn't bring enough money. He came to discuss it with me. It just so happens that I'm running out of money too, and the family hasn't sent it yet, so I have to turn to you for help. Please lend me a hundred silver dollars temporarily. When the money from my family arrives the day after tomorrow, I will return it to you immediately," Mr. Lu said with a smile in every sentence.</p>
<p>"Very convenient—but let me ask someone to get it for you! Because it's inconvenient for me right now." Miss Ding also forced an unnatural smile, because she clearly knew that this was still a set of ridiculous magic tricks.</p>
<p>So she stood up and pulled Mr. Lu towards the back room. The door opened, and Mr. Lu was suddenly struck by the sight of his wife in front of him, as if he had been hit by a heavy mallet.</p>
<p>When Little Rong's wife saw Little Rong come in, she couldn't bear it anymore and immediately jumped forward and grabbed him.</p>
<p>Miss Ding, however, said with a sneer, "Mr. Lu, the hundred silver dollars you want, please discuss it with that lady! What do you think?"</p>
<p>Mr. Lu could no longer tolerate it. He was ashamed and angry, and pushed his right hand hard, and his wife fell to the ground. He said loudly, "How did you get here?"</p>
<p>Little Rong's wife lay on the ground and cried loudly. She also said with great anger, "I was just about to ask you! How did you get here?"</p>

<h3>The Main Reasons for the Weariness of the Yarn and Flower Markets</h3>
<p>▲ The World Cotton Industry Is in a Recession ▲ Domestic Floods Make Actual Needs Unresponsive</p>
<p>The Trend of the Yarn Market Is Very Weary, Because the Situation of the World Cotton Industry Is in a Recession, the Pressure Is Still Heavy, the Floods in All Directions Are Getting Worse, and There Is No Active Hope for Actual Needs, So Today's Transactions by Various Groups Are More Clear Than Yesterday, and People's Hearts Are Also Softening, However, a Certain Manufacturer in This Month Is Using This Batch of Ten-Count Coarse Yarn Business to Buy About More Than 10,000 Packages, So the Market Price Rises After Massively Buying In, But the Distant Month Is Not Active Due to the Cotton Market, and Scattered Empty Sales Are Very Active, the Future Situation Still Does Not Escape the Weak Situation, But It Is Slightly More Expensive Than the Flower Market,</p>
<p>▲ The Near Rises and the Distant Falls in the Human Label. The Opening Market for the Human Label Before the Market, the Thoughts of Scattered Households Are Still Tired, Foreign Cotton Also Fell, Only Rongxinghao Massively Bought In This Month and Rose 1 or 2 Outside, the Distant Month Rose 3 or 4 Cents. It Was Heard in the Afternoon That Three-Product Yarn Fell and Actual Sales Were Not Smooth, and the Market Became Tired Again, the Current Month Fell 1 Cent, the Distant Fell 1 Taels, Transactions Calculated 51,400 Packages, Investigating the Sales of Hengyi 1,500 Packages, Gengfeng 1,350 Packages, Yichang 3,250 Packages, Daji 850 Packages, Gongtai 650 Packages, Rongxing Bought 10,450 Packages, Changfeng 2,200 Packages, Yiyu 1,300 Packages, Tongxing 1,650 Packages, Here Is the Closing Price of the Human Label on the Left,</p>

<p>October 153.9 Fall 1 96,300 January 154.1 665,950</p>
<p>▲ Spot Yarn Sales Are Scarce. The Sales of Spot Yarn Are Less Than Above. Investigating the Statistics of Purchases by Various Groups Throughout the Day, There Were 1,700 Packages of Spot and Term Goods, and 200 Packages Were Bought in the Same Industry. The Market Was Slightly Tired. The Customer Group Bought 95 Packages From the North Group, 85 Packages From Qingdao, 210 Packages From the Mainland, 50 Packages From Shantou, 250 Packages From Sichuan, 625 Packages From Tianjin, 180 Packages From Guangdong, 200 Packages From Jiangxi, and 50 Packages From Miscellaneous Groups,</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Tiredness of the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>▲ The Trend of the Foreign Cotton Market Is Shaking ▲ Various Foreign Firms Try to Sell, and Manufacturers Do Not Handle It</p>
<p>The Cotton Market Is Gradually Going Soft, Because the Overseas American Cotton Trend Is Deteriorating, Measuring Its Situation, There Is Also a Shaking Trend, So People's Hearts Suddenly Changed, and the Market Atmosphere Became Weak, However, the Buyers Pulled Tight and Did Not Let Go Because the Gold Price Was Difficult to Be Small and the Yarn Market Was Good, However, Various Foreign Firms Were Seeking Outlets Because of Overproduction, and They Were Very Concessive in the Market to Sell, However, Various Manufacturers Were Afraid and Did Not Handle It Because They Saw That the World Trend Was Dangerous, Because of Price Issues, It Had Not Been Properly Negotiated, and the Future of the Cotton Market Still Had to Be Seen as Tired,</p>
<p>▲ The Han Label Returned to Fall. The Opening Market for the Han Label Before the Market, Because American Cotton Tended to Fall, People's Hearts Were Weaker, and Each Fell 2 Cents. In the Afternoon, Because Dongyang Three-Product Cotton Tended to Fall, the Market Situation Was Tired Again, and Each Fell 2 Cents. Transactions Were Calculated at 79,500 Dan, Investigating the Sales of Lichang 2,000 Dan, Dafeng 1,500 Dan, Yukang 1,800 Dan, Jifeng 1,600 Dan, Yiyu 1,600 Dan, Liheng 1,700 Dan, Heshen Bought 2,100 Dan, Tianlong 2,400 Dan, Xiesheng 2,400 Dan, Shenchang 2,000 Dan, Here Is the Closing Price of the Han Label on the Left,</p>

<h3>Foreign Flowers and Yarns All Fall</h3>

<h3>The Grain River Down Rice Market Is Pregnant With Falling Momentum</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, There Were Still Many Sources From Various Groups in the South Market. There Were Many Deposits in Pu, and It Was Heard That the Urban and Rural Stores Were Being Repaired and Cut Back in Xinzha, and Their Intentions Were Quite Careless, So Picking and Selecting, Freshness Was Slightly Moving, As for the Customer Side, Because the Production Price in the Mainland Was Firm and Expensive, They All Held on to Selling, So the Thick Japonica Market Was Settled, There Was a Slight Amount of Thin Rice Inventory, the Stomach Was Lacking Chemicalization, This Street's Removal Was Actually Affected by the Squeezing of the Songhang Goods, Which Was Called Scattered, Resulting in the Price Being Reduced by 2 or 3 Corners, the Lu Yang Tip Was Modified Short by Foreign Rice, the Price Was Low Corner Xu, Although the Yin Chemical Goods Were Lacking, the Trend Was Even More Tired,</p>
<p>▲ The Zhabei Rice Market Was Still Without Any Spirit, Chang Bang's Top Goods Arrived and Sales Were Both Light, the Situation Was Settled, the Middle and Second Grades Had Good Demand, the Price Had No Increase or Decrease. Early and Late Rice and Jiangyin Kunshan Rice Transactions Were Very Clear, the Price Fell 2 Chi, the Foreign Lu Tip's Market Disc Was High and the Goods Were Strong, the Second Color Moved Downstream, Glutinous Rice Wine Households Continued to Handle It, So the Price Was Raised by 1 or 2 Corners, 100 Dan of New Japonica Arrived Yesterday, the Large Disc Opened Up Similar to Before, Foreign Rice Goods Were Lacking Scattered, But Customer Groups and This Street Had Not Selected and Picked, the Market Shape Seemed to Be Weak,</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Price Fall Causes Customer Chemicalization</h3>
<p>▲ The Beiyang Group Has a Trial ▲ The Market Is Still Small Nearly Horn</p>
<p>Yesterday's Foreign Rice Market Situation Was Still in a Tired Image, This Street Had Du Rice in the Market, the Handling Intention Was Still Weak, Most Customer Groups Were in the Midst of Watching and Waiting, So the Market Shape in the Morning Had Shown a Continuing Fall Trend, and the Goods Owners Who Wanted to Get Rid of It Urgently Were Still Willing to Depreciate the Price to Get Rid of It, the Market Threw off a Small Nearly Horn Afterwards, Tianjin and Other Beiyang Groups Rose Up to Try to Handle It, This Street Also Slightly Courteously Responded a Little, the Market Surface Turned into a Stable Image Again, Probably Because the Number of Deposits Below Was Not Many, and There Was a Need at the End, Fixed Goods Had Been Blocked, and There Was No Big Fall in the Market Surface for the Time Being, the Tong Market's Transactions Were Sensitive. 500 Packages of Rice, the Price Was 13 Yuan 6 Corners, 500 Packages of Small Twist, the Price Was 3 Yuan 6 Corners, 50 Packages of Annam Japonica, the Price Was 15 Yuan 2 Corners, Customer Branch's Inventory Had Been Exhausted, Yesterday's Market Only Shantou Group Went to See 300 Packages, the Price Was 13 Yuan,</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Price Report Declines</h3>
<p>▲ 6.5 to 6.9 Mace</p>
<p>After the price of various domestic rice types in this city rose some days ago, various domestic merchant groups competed to purchase foreign rice. Japanese merchants also speculatively placed orders, and the price at the origin immediately showed repeated increases. In addition, due to high gold prices, it was difficult to place orders profitably. Yesterday, foreign merchants and Chinese merchants received a telegram from Annam, reporting that the market price at the origin had slightly decreased, with quotations for No. 1 Saigon rice ranging from 6.5, 6.67 mace, to 6.89 mace. A bid price of 6.5 mace has already been telegraphed out, and it is expected to be transferred approximately tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Returns to Weakness</h3>
<p>▲ Although there are floods, transportation is not open ▲ Inland Yangtze merchant groups are mostly withdrawing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month tended towards a quiet trend again. The quotation for foreign wheat once decreased by about 0.2 taels. As for the inland Yangtze merchant groups, they have been gradually purchasing smoothly for over a month, and the quantity is truly enormous. Now, although disasters are continuous, it is like a vast ocean, and land and water transportation have not yet recovered. Even if they purchase spot goods, they cannot promote sales. Therefore, the mindset of these groups has turned to slackness, and quite a few are withdrawing. Observing the future, perhaps sales are difficult to stimulate due to actual difficulties, and the weakness must continue. As a result, this month fell by 0.075 taels compared to the previous day, September fell by 0.0125 taels, October and November fell by 0.01, December fell by 0.0125 taels, and January fell by 0.005 taels.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Near Weak, Far Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, each month showed a trend of near weak and far flat. This month, due to outsiders withdrawing, the market trend was sluggish. Because the short sellers' attitude was very firm, most were prepared to deliver. September also showed a flat and weak trend due to the Han merchant group withdrawing. From October to December, buying and selling were balanced, with no fluctuations. January also saw a decline due to very quiet buying interest. As a result, August, September, and January each fell by over 0.03 taels and remained unchanged. The current wheat market situation is that arrivals are still not very smooth, factory purchases are slightly better, and prices are similar to the previous day. Over 2,000 packages of wheat from the opening of Taicang, Kunshan, Anting, Chongming, Waigang, Wusong, and Pudong were handled by Fuxin Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Unified Disc, Gradually Rising</h3>
<p>▲ Cotton Lake Red Opens Quite Well</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams showed that Cuban current sugar prices have not changed. New York futures sugar for September and December each rose by 0.02 taels compared to the previous telegram. March and May of next year each fell by 0.02 taels. Java current futures sugar still lacks ups and downs. In the Association market, the buying interest for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was slightly active, with old goods priced at 11.45 to 11.5 taels, and new white goods priced from 11.6 taels, rising to as high as 11.7 taels, and the market shape was still firm. No. 20 medium sand white was quoted at 11.1 taels, with very few takers. Bowl blue was at 8.75 taels, and several hundred bags were traded, with a clear trend. Taikoo sugar also saw a gradual rise, with B mark at 12.15 taels, HM mark at 11.5 to 11.025 taels, back market at 11.55 taels, CW mark old goods at 12 taels, PX mark at 10.04 taels, O mark at 9.4 taels, and the market situation was still stable. Hua Xin offered to sell 1,000 bags of current old coarse sand white at a price of 11.45 taels. The market inventory of domestic Cotton Lake red sugar is very scarce. Several dozen packages were opened yesterday, and the price rose to 11.7 taels, and the market was stable and refined.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods, Lanxi Honey Dates Arrive in Volume, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Lanxi honey dates, since the new crop came out, initially sold for 40 taels due to the small quantity. Now that the source has reached a scale of 400 pieces, the price has gradually decreased. Yesterday, the market was only selling for 32 taels. However, this year's output is particularly abundant, and this price is not yet a low level, so the future market is still difficult to be optimistic about, and there is a possibility of continued decline.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Jinhua Autumn Silkworm Hatching and Seeding Smooth</h3>
<p>Farmers in various cities and villages under the old Jinhua Prefecture have suffered greatly from the damage caused by the weather to the spring and summer silkworms this year. The silkworm business has suffered huge losses, and most are preparing to raise autumn silkworms, ordering improved seeds from the provincial silkworm farms to engage in hatching. Recently, the weather has been sunny and the wind is gentle and the sun is warm, which is very suitable for the progress of silkworm farming. Large groups have already collected ants and urged them to turn green, which is quite smooth.</p>
<h3>Needle Eyebrow Pearl Tea, Sales to Europe Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the European dealers' interest in green tea such as needle eyebrow, show eyebrow, hemp pearl, and shrimp eye from Wuyuan and Tunxi was intense. The entire market transaction was quite lively, and the selling price was also better by 2 or 3 taels. The top price of Phoenix eyebrow has already opened to 95 taels, which is a high price not seen recently. As for the precious eyebrow market, it is slightly quiet, probably because British and French firms, in view of the recent sharp rise, have had to slow down their progress to try to suppress it, but the Chinese merchants have always been firm, and the market price has not risen or fallen compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Recent Woolen Cloth News</h3>
<p>The trade in woolen goods and woolen cloth has been in a quiet period recently. Yesterday, the buyers had pre-purchase news for the thick woolen goods sold in autumn and winter. Quite a few camel wool transactions were made, with Weilon, Xianda, Shengda, Hongfa, Tianxiang, and Wei Yi domestic goods strips selling for 2.15 taels, plain colors for 1.65 taels, delivered in Shanghai, with an additional silver dollar of 0.01 taels per yard for export. Other printed rotten wool, overcoat wool, leopard skin, black velvet, sable otter velvet, etc., were also inquired about. Most of the successful negotiations were limited to delivering silver and goods next month. White drill, white straight tribute, baleni, miyale, yellow twill, fine twill adhesive cloth, feather yarn and the like all lack buyers. Yuan Changqing gray, dark green plain drill, coming color Huate cloth, checkered Huate cloth, oblique dot chocolate, Yuan Qing straight tribute cloth, etc., all had transactions. Drill with 2.2 to 2.3 taels grades was popular, Yuan straight tribute with 5 taels customs clearance was popular, and the lower the grade of Huate cloth chocolate the more popular.</p>
<h3>Hardware, New Iron Goods Arrive in Volume, Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>Among the new iron goods, such as tinplate, British steel plate, French nails, angle iron, flat white iron, cigarette iron, new foreign yuan, bamboo steel, etc., in the past three or four days, more than 26,000 dan have been shipped one after another, and the inventory was temporarily full, so the customers who wanted to purchase were hesitant to move forward, so the entire market trading was quite quiet.</p>

<h3>The Widespread Automobile Manufacturing Industry</h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>The automobile is undoubtedly the finest craft in modern manufacturing. This is common knowledge. The materials used are available everywhere in the world, almost as if they are lying around for the taking. However, fewer people know this fact. Some even believe that the American automobile industry is the most developed, with the largest sales volume, and that American-made cars are sold in every country in the world. Therefore, they assume that America is the main base for automobile manufacturing because all the materials for automobile production are produced in the United States. This is not true.</p>
<p>In fact, the automobile manufacturing industry is an international product. The materials used in its production are produced everywhere. Therefore, people all over the world, whether directly or indirectly, depend on supplying materials for automobile manufacturing. In some areas, there are countless thousands of people involved. Thus, the forests, mines, farms, and factories in Africa, Asia, Europe, America, Oceania, and the Far East contribute significantly to the creation of a single automobile. To achieve excellence in automobile production, it is essential to seek various quality materials extensively. Other important minerals used in automobile manufacturing include: steel from North America; aluminum from Canada or South America; copper from Chile, Africa, and the Americas; tin from Malaysia and Bolivia; and nickel from Canada. However, the materials needed for automobile manufacturing are not limited to these. Wood, rubber, and silk are all necessary. Wood, used for building the car body and various accessories, comes mostly from forests around the world. Hardwood, in particular, is shipped from Central America. Rubber, used for making tires and electrical wires, comes from various Eastern countries. Wool is also used in large quantities in automobile manufacturing, often in thousands of pounds annually. Australia, Argentina, and Uruguay are the suppliers of this product. Silk is mostly shipped from Japan. Leather comes from livestock-raising areas, such as Australia and Argentina. Asbestos is supplied by Canada. High-quality cotton, known for its strength and resilience, is often used in the production of the best tires. This high-quality cotton comes from Egypt. Cork comes from Spain.</p>
<p>Various alloys and metals are used extensively in automobile manufacturing, often being specialties of specific regions. Manganese comes from Brazil, Russia, and India. Barium, a necessary component for batteries, comes from China and Mexico. Button steel comes from Peru. Tungsten comes from China. Molybdenum is mostly found in North America. Mercury is used extensively in automobile manufacturing and comes from Spain, Italy, Turkey, and Mexico. Steel used for manufacturing small, exquisite parts and testing tools is of high quality and comes from Switzerland. Recently, in the automobile manufacturing industry, there has been a high demand for materials used in manufacturing alloys and metal plates. However, this important metal is only produced in Rhodesia in central South Africa. Next are paint and gum, which mostly come from the Far East. New Zealand and tropical regions also produce them. Linseed oil, used for making oil, comes from Argentina and is essential for paint. Coarse paint, used as a base material, comes mostly from Italy and Spain, including shades and light colors. All of the above are directly related to automobile manufacturing. In addition, there are countless indirect supplies. Gasoline and other fuels are produced in various countries. The automobiles we see today are made with the highest quality materials. Their creation involves meticulous planning and is a crystallization of sophisticated craftsmanship. The manufacturing process follows a specific sequence: casting metal, creating molds, manufacturing parts, making machinery, and then proceeding to the car body. The final step is to assemble the various components to complete the automobile. Each step is executed with precision. Therefore, the manufacturing process incorporates scientific equipment and techniques that are unmatched by other manufacturing industries. Moreover, the pursuit of product excellence and cost-effective production are additional considerations. The results seen today demonstrate a high degree of perfection. However, the art of manufacturing is constantly refined, and innovation and improvement continue to advance daily without end. Once an automobile is manufactured and enters the market for public use, there is a sense of romance involved. Describing it in detail would be very interesting, but it would require too much paper and ink. Let's consider just one aspect. Everyone knows that automobiles are used for transportation. However, after an automobile is manufactured and leaves the factory to reach the market, it must also rely on transportation. Therefore, trains and ships are indispensable intermediaries. Similarly, the supply of automobile manufacturing materials relies on various transportation methods. Thus, whether directly or indirectly, mining, forestry, farming, manufacturing, and sales are all related to automobiles, providing employment for millions of people. Other related industries include road construction and bridge building. Generally speaking, the production of various regions and the work of various peoples are related to the automobile manufacturing industry in some way. As for the use of automobiles, broadly speaking, they are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Narrowly speaking, they are essential necessities in people's daily lives. Simply put, they can be called "manufacturers of happiness." Therefore, since the invention of the automobile, human evolution has been greatly influenced. The automobile is not to be overlooked.</p>
<h3>Astonishing Achievements of the Vauxhall Car</h3>
<p>Not only beautiful in appearance, but also in line with economic principles</p>
<p>The automobile industry today has reached a peak. However, in Europe and America, the number of automobile factories has become as numerous as carp crossing a river. Therefore, competition among the factories for business is fierce. If a factory falls behind in the competition, its business prospects are at risk of failure. This is why each factory must strive for excellence in the manufacturing of its vehicles, in order to achieve a significant position in the market. Recently, when factories manufacture cars, they not only demand beauty in appearance, but their main goal is to make vehicles that align with economic principles. Otherwise, they cannot effectively compete. Currently, there are many products from various factories that meet these principles, but the Vauxhall is particularly outstanding among them. The Vauxhall has long enjoyed a considerable reputation in the automobile industry. In 1930 alone, the Vauxhall was ranked as the number one new car produced by British factories. The reason for this is that, after the Vauxhall was introduced to the world, it underwent several long and short distance test drives, as well as automobile races. The results proved that it was not only aesthetically pleasing, but also the most economical vehicle on the market. This was truly unexpected.</p>
<p>The Vauxhall's ability to align with economic principles lies in its affordable price and excellent materials. Furthermore, after purchasing a new car, the owner can immediately see that the Vauxhall saves on all sorts of consumption compared to ordinary cars. Therefore, after the introduction of the new 514 model, those who purchased this new car in various countries around the world sent letters to the factory, praising it unanimously. This proves that the new Vauxhall car truly outperforms others. For example, a person named Dennis, purchased a 514 two-seater new car from the Vauxhall branch in Madras, India. After trying it out, he was very satisfied and immediately wrote to the factory, describing his experience with the car. He traveled 435 miles, all on highland roads, 7,500 feet above sea level. On average, he could travel 33 miles per gallon of gasoline, which is equivalent to 8.5 liters of fuel per kilometer. This level of economy is unparalleled by other cars. In addition, the Milan Vauxhall factory also received a letter from Mr. Rocigande, the secretary of the International Automobile Exhibition, expressing his praise for the new Vauxhall car. His letter is as follows:</p>
<p>"I am writing to your factory in the hope that you will know my sincere admiration for the new Vauxhall car. In short, the Vauxhall car is definitely the finest car among small cars, which is truly a source of pride. In two months, I drove the new Vauxhall car for 9,000 kilometers, or 5,600 miles, using various speeds and driving on different roads. Whether high mountains or flat plains, I tested it thoroughly. As a result, there were never any problems along the way, and there were no stops for repairs. The engine was consistently smooth and exceptionally fast, which was very satisfying. As for gasoline consumption, it was also very economical. Seven and a half gallons of gasoline could travel a total of 186 miles." The performance of the new car can be imagined.</p>
<p>The Vauxhall's produced vehicles are not only the 514 model, which can economize on gasoline, but also other new cars. The Vauxhall's recent business policy focuses entirely on improving its products, reducing car prices, and allowing car owners to save on all costs. Even six-cylinder cars are no exception. For example, a person named Patterson in India purchased a six-cylinder Vauxhall 521C convertible. After driving it, he was very satisfied and told people that when he bought the car, the car dealer told him that each gallon of gasoline could guarantee 18 to 20 miles. Afterwards, after driving it, it was more than that, as each gallon could travel 24.8 miles. Recently, the factory also told customers that if anyone found the Vauxhall car to be less economical than other cars, they could write a letter explaining the reason. After the factory receives the letter, it can find ways to improve the shortcomings. This shows the Vauxhall's concern for economic issues.</p>
<h3>Advertising Competition in the United States Automotive Industry</h3>
<p>— Yan Yu</p>
<p>Today, the application of advertising techniques in the world is extremely valued by general merchants. In commercial competition, they rely on advertising as the sole weapon. Therefore, various commercial advertisements are also changing with each passing day, with endless variations. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the American automotive industry. In recent years, American automobile manufacturers have sprung up like mushrooms and flourished for a time, holding the hegemony of the global automobile industry. The fierce advertising competition among them is truly shocking to hear.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, advertisements from automobile manufacturers are published in every issue of American newspapers and magazines, filling up many pages. Several famous newspaper offices, such as the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, and the Chicago Daily News, consider the annual automobile advertising revenue a significant income. It is said that the New York Times received more than US$5,500,000 in automobile advertising revenue last year, and the Chicago Daily News also had around US$300,000. Each manufacturer competes fiercely for the most advantageous automobile advertising position in newspapers, often making the editors of the newspapers find it difficult to decide. Because offending any party, if a break occurs, and the manufacturer stops sending advertisements, will greatly affect the newspaper's income. As for magazines, in addition to various automobile magazines, other magazines such as the nationally best-selling Saturday Evening Post, publish colorful automobile advertisements that are particularly vibrant and moving, greatly arousing people's desire to buy and achieving significant results.</p>
<p>In addition, the effectiveness of posters on the market is no less than that of newspapers and magazines. Even in remote rural villages, automobile advertisements of various colors are everywhere. The texts and pictures are mostly exceptionally vivid and interesting, often causing pedestrians to stop and watch unconsciously, leaving a deep impression in their minds. These posters vary in size and are mostly printed in color, often by famous advertising writers. Although the cost is quite high, they don't mind.</p>
<p>The use of electrical advertising has become increasingly common recently. Broadway in New York has always been known as the "City That Never Sleeps," with its richness and prosperity surpassing the entire city. It is especially lively at night, with traffic like a dragon and horses like water, as if it were daytime. Previously, only Ford had a magnificent electrical advertisement there, with bright and brilliant light that caught the eye of passersby. Now, Dodge, Austin, General Motors, and other manufacturers are unwilling to be outdone and have followed suit. For a time, it became fashionable to spend heavily to rent advertising space nearby and broadcast the latest electrical advertisements, with red and green lights reflecting each other, emitting ten thousand rays of light, even eclipsing the stars and moon.</p>
<p>Last spring, Ford came up with a unique idea and specially filmed the process of automobile manufacturing and all the scenes inside the factory, and showed these films free of charge at public institutions in major cities around the world. This film was brought to Shanghai this year and shown at places such as the University of Shanghai. Everything filmed in the film was exceptionally clear, from the purchase of raw materials to the completion of a car leaving the factory, all the procedures in between were filmed one by one. During the screening, the company also sent personnel to the scene to add a detailed explanation while the film was running. The film consisted of six reels and lasted one hour. At the same time, the company's employees also brought a large number of finely printed commemorative brochures and advertising leaflets, which were distributed to the audience on the spot as an aid to promotion.</p>
<p>General Motors is fond of social activities and specializes in planning all kinds of gatherings and competitions that are of interest to the public. For example, beauty contests for women are held in various bustling cities, and products from their factory are used as trophies to be awarded to the first-place winners. In addition, the factory often gives its latest products to social celebrities in various countries around the world to establish connections and promote publicity. This is indeed a new path in advertising techniques, with remarkably effective results that cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Austin has recently introduced a car-giving program with a simple procedure. Anyone who can introduce ten customers to purchase the factory's automobiles will be given the latest model of a small sports car, priced at more than US$700. This method has been in effect for three months. Although car salesmen are complaining incessantly, the sales of the factory's products have indeed made surprising progress. This is also a good method in advertising competition.</p>

All are enough to give Flyer a chance to show its climbing performance in Greece.</p>
<p>Buick Factory Increases Car Production. The Buick Motor Company in Flint, Michigan, USA, produced 18% more in March than in the same period last year. A total of 8,696 cars were produced in the factory in March 1930. In March 1931, its output increased to 10,271 vehicles. Therefore, the factory's activities increased by 32% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Africa Builds Automobile Roads. The hinterland of Africa is sparsely populated. Those who arrive are only hunters and ivory merchants. Modern automobile roads have now been built. Items are transported by automobiles, so that nations that have not been in contact with the world can also slightly enjoy the tide of world evolution. After the new road is built, the industrial output can be expected in the near future. The car road between Minluo and Congo has been built. The 600-mile road from Alexandria to Luxor has also been successfully planned. Another road will be built to Timbuktu.</p>
<p>Chevrolet Will Reach 8 Million. According to the Chevrolet Motor Company officials, Chevrolet cars will soon reach 8 million. The time will be in the middle of this year. It also said that more than half of its company's products have been produced in the last four years.</p>

<h3>Domestically Produced Heavy-Duty Truck</h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>We have long been eager for domestic factories to manufacture automobiles to rival imported goods. Because in the past two decades, the automobile industry has become increasingly developed, and because the Chinese people cannot manufacture them themselves, all kinds of vehicles have to be purchased from Europe and the United States. The outflow of money has been difficult to record. Moreover, European and American countries regard the Far East as the only sales market for automobiles. Then the development of land and water transportation in China has become an opportunity for these countries to sell more cars, and there is no domestic car to come out. The lack of progress in material aspects is embarrassing. Recently, I read a Reuters report from Fanyang on June 19, stating that after the first domestically produced heavy-duty truck in China was completed, the Liaoning Arsenal held a celebration to commemorate the grand event. Factory Director Li Jun plans to send the car to various parts of North China for trial operation to promote publicity, etc. I cannot help but be delighted because the first domestically produced heavy-duty truck has been completed and opened a new era in the Chinese automobile industry. However, the manufacturing and process of the heavy-duty truck is not known in detail due to the brevity of the telegram. Recently, I read a description of the first domestically produced heavy-duty truck in the Beijing Morning Post. The matter is quite interesting. It said that three years ago, after the civil war ended, people in Liaoning said that Liao had two major arsenals and produced too much military equipment. They all wanted to use the factory's machines to make more useful tools. This idea was adopted by Zhang Xueliang, the authority of Northeast China. Therefore, the two factories were reorganized into factories. The Fanyang Arsenal is engaged in steel manufacturing, and produces a lot. Not only for the railway, but also has a huge sales market in China. The other factory, director Li Yijun, is engaged in fundamental and great work. He suggested that the factory should manufacture heavy-duty trucks to meet domestic needs, and said that the Chinese people all want to sit in cars. I will make the Chinese people understand the manufacturing method of cars so that they can sit and wait and get some comfort so that they do not often use foreign goods. Zhang Xueliang and other important officials in Northeast China agreed and gave him 750,000 yuan as start-up funds. Thus, work began. A Liaoning Arsenal Industrial Manufacturing Department was established, and the famous American automobile designer Maya was hired. He also contacted foreign automobile companies in order to purchase machines that he could not manufacture himself. After two years, the first car has recently been completed. The following description of manufacturing is worth noting: "Two types of heavy-duty trucks have been completed, one is McdIe75o and the other is McdIeIoo, specially prepared for Chinese demand, that is, specially prepared for walking on bad roads. Therefore, the speed is slower, and the vehicle is larger than any foreign-made car. The various details of the McpIe75 car chassis weigh 3,500 pounds. The body weighs 1,000 pounds. Excluding the weight of 4,000 pounds, the total weight is 8,500 pounds. The power is 615 horsepower. The normal speed is 25 miles per hour. The fastest speed is 44 miles per hour. The wheel is 142 inches high and the body is 9 feet long. The price is 1,070 gold yuan. The McdIeIoo car chassis weighs 4,600 pounds. The body weighs 1,400 pounds. Excluding the weight of 6,000 pounds, the total weight is 12,000 pounds. The power is 86 horsepower. The normal speed is 20 miles per hour. The fastest speed is 30 miles per hour. The wheel is 160 inches high. The body is 11 feet long. The price is 2,000 gold yuan. The following parts were purchased from foreign countries. (1) Engine. (2) Tires. (3) Electrical supplies. In addition, all the items used in the car are manufactured by the factory. Regarding purchases from foreign countries, Director Li said that foreign car manufacturers also do not manufacture all the car supplies in their own country. They also have to order from other countries. Because China currently does not have all kinds of application materials, it has to buy from foreign countries. He also said that he will strive for progress in the future. As mentioned above, Mcdle75o has been completed and tested. It is quite satisfactory, etc." From this description, the description of the domestically produced heavy-duty truck is detailed and thorough. In China, where industry is declining, there are actually domestically produced heavy-duty trucks. No wonder foreign telegrams are widely reported in Western newspapers. However, I still have something to say, that is, this first domestically produced car is specially designed for walking on bad roads. If it can be promoted and expanded, and the production of automobiles continues, it will be able to meet the needs of the Chinese people. Although, the Minsheng Factory affiliated to the Fanyang Engineering Corps has successfully built a new car. This is the first car made in China. I think that not only will the Liao Factory continue to manufacture to improve the quality and expand the application of the products, but factories across the country will also follow suit and increase day by day. This is indeed a cause for celebration for the future of China's industry. It also means a lot of recovery for the rights and interests.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Road Construction in Various Counties of Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Jun Chao</p>
<p>Dongguan. The streets of Dongguan County are narrow and traffic is very inconvenient. Recently, as various counties have started constructing automobile roads one after another, the magistrate of Dongguan County is determined to start constructing automobile roads to facilitate transportation. The County Public Works Bureau has completed the measurement of the automobile roads to be constructed and drawn the drawings. The first phase of the planned automobile roads is the lower market street, Maixian Street, Jiangu Street, Tieguo Street, and Maimu Street. The route of Maimu Street leads directly to the West Gate and connects with the Wanlongtai Highway. The route of the lower market street leads directly to the provincial city pier. The city wall will also be demolished and rebuilt into a ring road. The Construction Department has approved it, and construction will begin soon.</p>
<p>Jiujiang. The construction of automobile roads in Jiujiang City has been going on for many days. The first section starts from Guanglongdian in Xingfuli and ends at Dafudian in Xingrenli. It has now been built to Shibuli, about 600 feet long. Sidewalks on both sides have also been built for 500 feet. The entire project will be completed in about fifteen days. The second section starts from Sangxu Caiting Street and ends at the first gun tower. The paving of the road surface is underway, and the sidewalks on both sides have also been built for more than 100 feet. The third and fourth sections are being tendered. All the street stones are being dug up. The road bridge in front of the Municipal Bureau has been completed.</p>
<p>Southwest. The third phase of automobile roads in the southwest is now under construction. The route runs from Hebang to Taiping Street as one section, and from Tongrong Street to Mingjia Ancestral Hall as another section. The area width of both roads is 30 feet. The height of the filling depends on the unevenness of the original streets. Therefore, the Taiping Street section needs to be filled to a height of 12 feet, and the Mingjia Ancestral Hall section needs to be filled to a height of 6 feet. The shops along the route have moved to San Gong Temple and Gao Street for temporary business. The road project was originally scheduled to be completed in three months. However, the recent floods in the west have been slightly delayed and may not be completed on schedule.</p>
<p>Foshan. The Lanshi automobile road previously built in Foshan has now been completed and officially opened to traffic. There are many passengers. The public bus is operated by Lianhua Motor Company. For the convenience of passengers, new vehicles have been added to the service. The entire journey takes only 20 minutes. The entire route of the Funing automobile road has also been planned and will soon be tendered out for construction.</p>
<p>Chencun. The Chencun road construction project was originally divided into three lines, A, B, and C. The A line road has been surveyed and completed. The width was originally set at 30 feet. Recently, merchants along the road felt that the width was not suitable and jointly submitted a request to the Construction Department to construct the road according to the original plan of 50 feet wide. The Construction Department has considered the issue and found that the width of 50 feet on Nan'an and Tongle Streets is not a problem. However, the widest part of the main street can only be 34 feet. The road connects Nan'an Street, Tongle Street, and the main street. Construction will begin within days.</p>

<h3>Foch's War Diaries (to be continued)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>Two days later, on July 23, I reiterated the previous order as follows: ... If our army is to achieve complete victory in this battle, the important key is to strike the enemy without delay. All strength should be fully supplied to the Tenth Army. The Tenth Army should concentrate these strengths on one part of its front line in order to carry out a powerful offensive in a particularly important area, namely the Datuna area. The Sixth Army assisted on the right, and the remaining forces were concentrated on the left wing. This attack threatened the enemy to withdraw from the entire area south of Datuna in a difficult state.</p>
<p>With all strength transferred to assist the Tenth Army, the Fifth Army will inevitably have only limited troops at its disposal. Therefore, the Fifth Army must implement chain warfare. Every battle must concentrate all its strength and create an advantage to prepare for the next battle. For example, progress towards the highlands north of the Anker River must create opportunities to facilitate an attack on the south side of the river. An attack on the south side of the river must threaten the enemy to withdraw from the area north of the Marna River.</p>
<p>At the time of this command and intensified fighting, I cannot ignore the possibility of a flanking attack by the German army in other directions. In order to escape our army's large encirclement, the Supreme Command of the Central European Empire may use its reserve troops north of the Coriasis River to attack the British line to hold it in check. I therefore asked Commander Petain to reassemble all the tired soldiers who had withdrawn from the front line behind the left wing of the French army to prepare. I also transferred the two British divisions that had been sent to the south of the Sham River on July 12 back to the command of General Haig.</p>
<p>The troops of the Sixth and Tenth Armies were mostly concentrated on both sides of the Orque River, and began to attack Orsy on July 25. In one great victory, Orsy was occupied. The eastern slope of Sherman Mountain, which controlled the Orque River basin, became a foothold for our army. This battle dispelled the enemy's hope of holding the Orque River defense line and became an important victory for our army.</p>
<p>The next day, the German army retreated to the highlands north of the river. The retreat was so rapid that our army's advance troops could not catch up.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 29th, the French Tenth, Sixth, and Fifth Armies stopped along the front of the Gran-le-Sour, Datuna, Circhi, Renny line on the highlands.</p>
<p>The enemy insisted on resisting stubbornly here. On July 30 and 31, our army wanted to defeat him, but it was in vain. The villages of Seringi, Serchi, and Felleraron were gained and lost several times. The war was in a stalemate.</p>
<p>According to my command on July 25 and Commander Petain's instructions on July 29, the Tenth Army attacked again at 4:45 a.m. on August 1. The French 25th, 41st, and 68th Divisions and the British 34th Division, with the assistance of tank artillery, charged the Granle Sour heights. Although the enemy resisted very fiercely, our army finally occupied the German line between Granle Sour, Sevenni, and Climaie with hand-to-hand combat. This decisive battle threatened the German army to retreat again.</p>
<p>At dawn on August 2, the Tenth, Sixth, and Fifth Armies saw that the enemy had retreated completely. The three armies did not fold up their troops and did not fire a single bullet until the evening, advancing to the highlands south of the Vance River. Shaason was thus recovered.</p>
<p>The progress continued on the 3rd, our army reached the left bank of the Vance River and made contact with the enemy again, with outposts crossing the river in several places.</p>
<p>On the 4th, our army encountered the German army defending the Vance River and had no intention of giving up. Our army must deploy a new offensive and transfer new strength lines to have hope of defeating the enemy. Even so, it is difficult to expect an immediate victory. Moreover, at this time, our army is preparing for another important battle, namely the Battle of Picardy and Santer. Our army's current number does not allow our army to undertake this battle and simultaneously launch an offensive against the Vance River. Therefore, I ordered the Central Reserve "to feign strength on the defense line south of the Vance River, so that the enemy would get the impression that our army was still preparing for a fierce attack."</p>
<p>In this way, after three weeks of fighting, the Second Battle of the Marne ended. The German army lost the battle on July 15, and the Allied forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive on the 18th, winning every battle. To this day, they still have the upper hand. The teams participating in the war included American, British, Italian, and French armies. The results of the war were quite important. The Allied forces captured 30,000 prisoners, more than 600 artillery pieces, and 3,000 machine guns. The front line was shortened by 28 miles, the Paris Sheron railway line was restored to traffic, and the danger in Paris was eliminated.</p>
<p>The German army's morale was dispersed, and our army's military appearance was greatly enhanced. Our army had previously been forced to take a defensive posture for four months due to the enemy's numerical superiority. Now, taking the opportunity to strike first, it has taken the initiative of the counter-offensive and leaped back to hold the lead in this long war. It is necessary to quickly mobilize the entire strength of the Allied forces and take advantage of the victory to wipe out the enemy before they recover their strength. (To be continued)</p>
