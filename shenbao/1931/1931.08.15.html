<h3>駐美德兩國公使之重要</h3>
<p>駐美公使與駐德公使。自伍朝樞蔣作賓兩氏離職而後。迄今爲時已久。職位尙虚。其爲愼重人選。或另有他因。吾局外人自未易臆測。不過以美德兩國在國際間地位之重要。及其與我國關係之深切。而又舉此世界風雲瞬息萬變之秋。使位久懸。似非所宜。若以人廢事。則記者更期期以爲不可。</p>
<p>美國爲現今世界三强之一。同時又爲世界之黃金國家。紐約華爾街之經濟勢力。不僅足以奴隸歐洲。抑且足以左右世界。在國際政治之舞台上。美國實具有絶大之發言權。而其對於我國。一方面則以欲打破列强之旣成勢力範圍。使能分得一杯利益之羹。故對我外交上。常取温和主義。另一方面。亦常隠然持「力」以牽制列强之行動。其於太平洋局勢之將來。必爲重要主角。換言之。即其所關係於我國者至爲重大。德國自大戰而後。國際地位固遠不如前。而且處於國際經濟束縛之下。國勢猶常呈風雨飄搖之危狀。然彼國民能以沉毅奮鬥之精神力圖復興。彼外交家更能以靈活之手腕。力謀自衛。束挾蘇聨以自重。西聨英國以爲輔。其地位足以攪動歐洲之局勢。且彼國之工業人材。在世界允推首屈之指。而其在世界文化地位上之重要。更無待言。我國家雖與德尙無若何縝密之關係。但求未來兩國實業上之携手。以謀發展我國産業。亦至爲要圖。故我國今日對於該兩國公使之選派。實不容稍緩者也。公使一職。爲國家利害所關。亦國際觀瞻所繫。於其人選。自必鄭重簡擇。但求其有人格。求其有實學。求其有應變之才。求其有深遠之識。求其有窺人隠微之機能。求其有厲行革命外交之精神。固不必斤斤於外交禮儀之如何嫻熟外國語言之如何流利。對人交際之如何周到等皮毛本領。尤有進者用人惟材。用乃稱職。蓋居政之道。首求在公。公則明。明則能遴選眞材。而材乃得其用。國乃得用其材。否則雖有公使。固亦有等於無。於國實無裨益。此尤爲選擇公使人才上應先行注意者也</p>

<h3>閻返晋詳情</h3>
<p>由大連取道瀋陽經平綏路</p>
<p>途中穿和服并扮鄉人模樣</p>
<p>今後行程未定態度似鎭靜</p>
<p>太原通訊、閻錫山由大連返籍渻、業誌昨訊、當時以官方未允正式發表、故未述其詳、今日太原警備司令部、特邀集各報記者、宣佈閻由大連返晉經過情形、據稱係乘火車、並非飛機、則與大同來人所說略有不同耳、連日各方對於閻之態度、極爲注意、記者將調查所得、分誌如左</p>
<p>回晉經過閻錫山於本月三日夜九時三十分、偕同醫博士靳瑞萱、由大連乘火車出發、至四日上午七時、車抵遼寗、下車後與迎候之老友數人、稍作寒暄、即赴常盤旅館休息、用餐後、即於是日上午十時二十分、乘北寗車、迄下午十時三十五分抵豐台、在車站以西之天和客棧休息一時餘、即乘十一點四十分之平綏車、於五日夜三點五十分抵大同、在某公館少休息、即乘長途汽車、行至懷仁縣、遇河邊村自用汽車來接、當換乘自用汽車、於六日下午三時抵河邊村、即赴私庽休息、</p>
<p>到晉以後自閻氏抵大同後、此間各將領即有所聞、六日晨砲兵司令周玳、即乘自用汽車往謁、伺日午十二時、警備副司令張會詔、又乘車往謁、至晚七時餘、徐永昌·楊愛源·孫楚等、亦先後乘汽車前往、與閻作長時間談話、惟内容多係共叙離情、李服膺馮鵬翥楊耀芳等將領、亦已於昨日分乘汽車往謁、馮楊李孫等、已於今日下午返并、</p>
<p>分電蔣張　閻此次回晉、稱係因省親而來、昨日已正式電知蔣總司令張副司令、謂本人巳於本月六日、安抵五台原籍、知注特聞云云、前隨閻赴連之趙戴文·梁汝舟·孫煥崙·等、現仍住大連黑石礁四元二六三番地、因該地近海、空氣極佳、夏日避暑、尤爲適宜、</p>
<p>閻之態度　閻錫山此次突然歸來、外間傳說紛紜、莫衷一是、有謂其消極者、有謂其積極者、一般　關心時局者、無不競相探詢、據某氏談稱、閻本人聲明、係回晉省親、其態度已明白表示、無須細述、惟以余個人判斷、賣友求榮之事、恐彼不爲、或者尙有其他私事也、</p>
<p>閻來并說　外傳閻有擬乘此次歸里之便、於日内來并、與衆友好、共叙離情說、又閻對昨日赴河邊訪問之諸友表示、謂我將赴并、探望諸君云云、聞衛隊營已派隊一連、開往河邊警衛、</p>
<p>隨從談話　記者昨訪隨閻同來之醫官靳瑞萱君、詢以閻氏返晉經過、據談、閻於二日接到家中電報、謂乃翁患病、希其返里探望、閻接電後、甚焦急、當晚未安眠、翌晨閻突請靳氏至前、謂汝能與余冐險否、余擬返里一行、探望父病、汝如能同余偕返、診治余父疾、甚爲妥當、靳氏當即應諾、願偕返、遂即準備行程、即晚（三日）靳氏携帶　手提包、與閻氏由庽出發、聲言至海濱遊覽、當晚九時三十分、遂即購買頭等火車票二張、登車離大連、閻氏身着中服、四日上午六點半抵遼寗、住常盤旅館、上午十時二十分、換日本和服、購北寗車頭等客票兩張、同車内先有一日本人在座、靳氏旅學日本多年、擅長日本語、遂與該日人用日語談話、因此車中旅客、以爲閻與靳等、皆係日本人、故無人注意、沿途亦無人盤問、五日上午十點半抵豐台、在天和棧休息一小時、閻氏另扮鄉人模樣、購平綏三等車票、當晚三點五十分到大同、在某公館少事休息、即乘長途汽車返河邊、及至懷仁縣、適遇閻氏汽車來接、遂換車於六日下午三時抵河邊、及閻抵家、乃翁正臥病牀間、係患老衰疾、因年老氣衰、飲食亦不甚佳、故覺病勢稍重、當由敝人診脈、開方服藥、當晚靳氏即由閻宅乘汽車來省、靳氏擬於明日再往河邊、探閻父病、按靳瑞萱·宇祥垣·日本醫學博士、本省壺關縣人、曾任河北大學敎授、去歲隨閻至大連、今次隨閻一同返晉、</p>
<p>行程未定　據由五台謁閻歸來者談、閻對各往訪者、除叙離情外、對時局頗鮮表示、有以此後行程見詢者、閻僅謂稍經數日再定而已、觀其態度、似極鎭靜、閻於六日上午七時許、由大同偕趙承綬等起程、行至崞縣之原平鎭時、前晉南鎭守使張培梅等、在站迎迓、閻即邀張氏、同乘汽車偕返河邊、抵忻縣李服膺等亦乘車來迎、閻着白夏布大衫、平頂寬邊白草帽、白襪黑鞋、精神頗健、（十日）</p>

<p>鄂省水災</p>
<h3>難民數百萬</h3>
<p>各縣仍紛紛報災</p>
<p>損失不下數千萬</p>
<p>責任問題之研究</p>
<p>漢口通信、鄂省發生水災、業已多日、全省精華、損失殆盡、而各縣報災者、仍紛至沓來、災情之慘、災區之大、誠空前所未有、茲復將各縣災况、分誌如下、</p>
<p>日來各縣報災者、共數十縣、最重者雲夢全縣七十餘垸、被淹五十餘垸、孝感全縣堤垸盡潰、潛江全縣一百五十餘垸、被淹百餘、應城全縣堤垸盡破、汜濫百里、圻水縣北永幹堤、永固支堤潰决、永保堤亦連帶被害、全縣被淹、松滋全縣共四區、一四兩區盡没、石首縣被淹田地一萬餘畝、沔陽縣江堤均潰、新堤全市、已成澤國、黄崗全縣圩堤潰盡、漢川縣堤垸多潰、未潰者亦被積水淹没、咸寗縣湖水泛溢、田禾盡淹、安陸縣山洪暴發、田廬冲没、羅田縣洪水汜濫、民田被淹、陽新縣江水倒灌、東北中三鄉俱淹、黄梅縣江堤潰决、民圩盡破、災民達二十萬人、鍾祥縣湖河兩鄉被淹、江陵縣岑河口一帶、被水淹没、天門縣岳口以下堤防均潰、人物爲墟、東西南三鄉、通行無路、圻春縣永保永固兩堤潰决、被淹面積約八十餘里、房屋倒盡、廣濟縣江水倒灌、羅城縣堤外十八圍、堤内三十六圍均潰、被淹百里、黃陂縣東西南沿河各區縱横六十餘里、盡成澤國、鄂城縣江堤崩潰九十餘丈、淹田十餘萬畝、房屋倒塌千棟、損失財産三十餘萬元、嘉魚縣官堤民垸、共潰决七八處、公安全縣被淹、隨縣西北沿河均淹、平地水深丈餘、監利縣新堤潰口、江水倒灌全縣、鄖縣全縣被淹、當陽縣山水　發、全縣受災、枝江縣沿江水泛、受災甚重、以上均據民政廳調查、其災情較輕及未經呈報者、尙不在内、大約被淹田地、不下數萬畝、災民不下數百萬、損失之數、不下數千萬、</p>
<p>湖北省政府曁水災急賑委員會、當水災發生時、迭向蔣主席·行政院·中央賑務會·各省當局呼籲、函電紛馳、聲嘶力竭、並商請平漢路局·特稅局·統稅局·代徵附捐、通令各機關職員、一體减俸、以便繼續放賑、又以災民衆多、災區廣大、决派員分赴各縣、實地調查、兼撫慰受災民衆、市黨部整理委員會、亦召集各區黨部·各同業公會·各工會代表、開臨時會議、討論救濟辦法、經决定要案多件、（一）函請市政府逐日派人調查水淹各處、防範房屋倒塌、並令各區黨部各民衆團體、隨時調查具報、（二）函請省市政府迅將已潰各堤口、設法堵塞、（二）函請急賑會·公安局、取締救護船需索渡資、（四）函請市政府、酌搭木橋、以濟行人、（五）函請急賑會、嚴禁放賑人員對災民行兇、並注意普遍散發、（六）函請警備部、制止流氓拆取被淹房屋、（七）函請防險處及急賑會、救濟宗關一帶難民、並救護堤閘、此外如增加難民收容所、勒令難民遷移、運送難民回籍、均在分别進行中、</p>
<p>關於此次水災責任問題、各方極爲注意、各報亦間有論及、省主席何成濬、亦曾擬澈查、良以災情奇重、各負責人員、事先旣未能預防、臨急又未能應變、空糜國帑、貽誤蒼生、如不嚴加處分、自不足以平民憤、而儆將來、但何主席十日在省府紀念週報告、則以爲責任問題、不能歸咎於人、略謂「最近水災、爲六十年來所未有、究竟是否爲人力防範不週、尙在調查中、然據多數報告、及本人實地查勘、實不能歸咎於人、不過自水災發生以後、新</p>

<h3>長江水量激增</h3>
<p>三鎭連日在搶險中</p>
<p>漢商民損失四百萬</p>
<p>漢口通信、長江水勢、自十日起、略趨平定、十一日侵晨、且退落寸許、武漢人民、方相慶更生、詎是日晚間、朔風怒吼、大雨滂沱樹木爲拔、廬舍傾圯、而江水復繼續增漲歷十二十三兩日、仍有漲無已、最深處已達五十一尺五寸五分、形勢遂更趨嚴重、據熟悉水勢之某工程師報告、若再漲八寸、武漢三鎭、即將同淪巨浸、未來災象、尤足驚人、不知當局者、果何以善其後也、茲記三鎭目下之搶險形勢如次、</p>
<p>漢口方面　各處堤閘、連日受水大影響、均呈險象、尤以漢市橋口至宗關一帶之堤防、最爲危殆、是處有堤三道、均以橋口爲終點、第一道爲川漢路基、第二道爲張公堤、第三道爲皇經堂堤、川漢路基與張公堤、係防後湖之水、堤之高度相等、距離亦近、皇經堂堤係平漢路延長之線、專離亦近、皇經堂堤係平漢路延長之線、專防襄水、較張公堤約低四尺、經加修後、仍僅高出江水寸許、因襄水勢平、未致潰决、而川漢路基、外臨大水、内有積潦、當十二日風狂浪湧時、該路自太平洋肥皂廠以下、至一三一二段長約二里、被水越路而過、危險萬狀、經市政府工程隊、竭力搶堵、就路基斜坡、釘植木樁、再加蔴袋、數小時後、浪稍平而工亦竣、始轉險爲夷、張公堤亦遂賴以保障、</p>
<p>武昌方面　最險者爲漢陽門下之筷子街、次爲大堤口·徐家棚等處江堤、及賽湖堤之湖堤、十三日、筷子街地段、忽决一口、江水内灌、經建廳派工搶救、當將潰口堵塞、大堤口·徐家棚·賽湖堤一帶、亦就水勢高下、加築沙包、或不至發生意外、惟武慶閘之子堤賓善堤、因水超過堤身、故附近之八步街·新橋·湘鄂路路軌、均被淹没、但堤尙未破、若從速加高加厚、仍可堵水、</p>
<p>漢陽方面　黑山·楊家河·南岸嘴一帶堤防、亦告危急、防險處已令縣政府迅速搶救、並飭水利局派員協助、如水不再漲、或可無虞、</p>
<p>漢口市之排水工程、自七日起開始建築木堤、十日已完成經始線、原定十二日至遲十四日、即將全市積水排盡、詎因北風驟起、浪湧如山、沿江之木堤、均被水冲破、原植樹木、亦連根拔起、未破之木堤、復因水漲淹没、失其效用、如是排水計劃、遂不能不歸於失敗、但防險事務處、仍在繼續進行、昨已嚴令承包是項工徎之漢興昌營造廠、迅將冲壞堤壩、與未完工程、加以補修、尅日開始抽水、並派員向第三特别區（即前英租界）電燈局、商借水風箱應用、聞該項風箱、每部每時可抽水三十萬加倫、如堤壩築成、江水不漲、排水計劃、仍有完成之望、又此次水災、漢市商業、極受影響、商民損失、不計其數、即以所賠開支而論、每日損失共約三十萬元、現被災十餘日、共計損失四百萬元、連同各種損失計算、恐不下數千萬元、亦可見受痛之深矣、（八月十三日）</p>

<p>特派委員　政府頃已特派行政院副院長宋子文·内政部長劉尙清·實業部長孔祥熙·振務委員會委員長許世英·及辦理西北振務之朱慶瀾氏·等五人爲該會委員、並以宋副院長爲委員長、日内更將選任中外熱心人士爲委員、</p>

<p>協助調查　據各處報告情形、已足證明災情重大、然詳細狀况、仍難洞悉、故該會擬即進行詳確調查、由河工專家·曁工程師·用飛機飛往災區、從事測量、并請海關郵政電報各機關、隨時切實報告、此外由各被災省區地方官廳、調查報告外、並託由中外各私人團體、如中國銀行·麵粉公會·美孚洋行·英美烟公司·及各地敎會、協助調查災區狀况、俾明眞相、</p>

<p>此次水災、爲害鉅大、政府知非如往歲各省偏災、僅恃發放少數欵項·及僅由各地方及私人振務團體·所能辦理、蓋以揚子江流域、爲中國財富之區、政府爲保全國本計、故對於救濟計劃、不第使目前各地災民衣食有資、且將使各該區域、得以恢復地方生産之能力也、</p>

<h3>光怪陸離之西門子總廠</h3>
<p>— 許士騏自柏林寄</p>
<p>愚抵柏林之次日。因駐德使署梁代辦介紹。偕内子縵華。驅車往觀西門子總廠。該廠位於柏林西郊。範圍綦廣。因名西門子城。Siemensstadt有架空車及電車。與外間直接交通。爲德國最大工廠之一。</p>
<p>該廠發軔於一八四七年。創辦人爲維納紋西門子君。Werner　von　Siemens初營製造電機小工業。資本僅兩萬馬克。雇工只十人。逐漸發展。至一八八三年。乃遷郊外。自建廠屋。迄今凡八十四載。工人竟達十一萬餘。資本增至二二○·○○○·○○○馬克。出品電機。大如郵船·飛機·鐵軌·橋樑·機件。小如家庭日用電爐·電灶·電扇等件。推銷世界各國。突飛猛進之精神。殊屬令人欽佩。</p>
<p>愚等參觀時。由總工程師鮑爾氏F·Pohl殷勤招待。鮑氏操英法意等國語至流利。導觀陳列室。環列各種模型。自原始電機。以至最新器械。一一俱備。正廳陳設創辦人西門子氏半身銅像。播然老者。緬懷創業之艱鉅。而似其精神毅力之雄偉。依次參觀製造部工作。及已製成各種應用電機。林林總總。日新月異。愚對機械工程。非所素習。然觀其設備之完美。組織之嚴密。嘆觀止矣。</p>
<p>午間由廠中欵以午餐。餚饌殊精美。據鮑氏云。該廠廚房。使用電力。四千人之餐。可於一小時内烹就。電力功用之宏。於茲可見。旋登高樓。作全城之鳥瞰。廠屋羅列。烟突四布。後參觀該廠附設之幼稚園。以敎育工人子弟。他如運動·娛樂·居住·各種設備。自生活工作。以至撫幼·疾病·保險等項。無微不至。并分贈精美刋物·藉留紀念。</p>
<p>德國科學精神。磅礴世界。近以生産過剩。工人失業。經濟竭蹶。至於此極。然忍耐刻苦之精神。百折不撓之毅力。卒能打破難關。重新建設。至足爲吾人努力之楷模也。</p>
<h3>日人發現韓滿歷史古蹟</h3>
<p>— 遊虚</p>
<p>日本考古專家金井保山博士。去冬曾旅行滿洲一帶。搜得我國及朝鮮之古物甚多。近博士來杭游歷。携有古器及古書多種。一般好古者流。爭往投謁。藉以先覩爲快。據博士語人。渠研究滿韓歷史上之古蹟。已垂二十年。覺惟朝鮮之史蹟爲最難蒐集。今乃於無意中覓得數百種之史料。殊出望外。又曰渠在滿洲所得之碑文。有一百數十種。其中大半爲世人所未經發現者。當渠在滿洲時。嘗與同行之八木金一郎及三好長暉等。商得該地總領事同意。從事羅掘。發現古錢古鏡古銅器無數。在寗古塔南。即渤海之上京。原爲金朝之東京。今之所謂東京城子者。掘得古瓦及古銅器尤多。又於寗古塔得金代之銅印。及清代發祥時代之甲胄。皆罕見之　也。其所携之古書中。最爲好古者所賞鑒者。凡有數種。爰誌之如下。（一）人物考八十冊。（二）東文選八十冊（三）集古眞揭十六冊（四）簡牘眞蹟六冊。（五）爛餘（李朝政權爭奪史）十冊。（六）弘齋全書。（正宗王御製）（七）朝野僉載（自太祖至肅宗）。（八）朝野會通（自太祖至景宗）。（九）燃黎記述（自太祖至文宗）。（十）高麗史韓本全部。其他碑板撼本中。如清太祖敗明大軍於撫順東方之戰勝紀念碑。金代文字之進士及第。碑文及古銅人古瓦古錢。皆足供學者之參考。而於史學上有莫大之價值。惜乎皆操諸日人之手。可痛也歟。</p>
<h3>給三妹的一封信</h3>
<p>— 徐碧波</p>
<p>那天晚上。帶了這件笨重的皮箱。和一隻甜醬罎子。怪不方便地上了人力車。那車夫大約没有吃飽夜飯。所以他一搖一擺的走去。飛毛腿竟成了牛步化。他並且窮得連車燈都没有。兀是從黑暗的荒僻去處走。在偶然經過狹巷時。兩旁的肉陣。（便是赤膊乘凉者）往往厲聲呵叱他不識趣。我也屢屢爲着他。平空多出了一身汗上的汗。</p>
<p>在黑暗的過程中。借着閃電的光芒。竟然望見北寺塔了。到達車站後。我忙將回票交給行李員。簽子一張提單。急急忙忙的穿過了地道。那氣吞雲夢的龐然大物。也口吐白烟。蠕蠕地向西到來。</p>
<p>車開了。天上的凉風。却並不因人而施。絶不勢利地。也使侷促不安的我。沾惠着不少的凉意。但是這可愛的北寺塔。却愈離愈遠了。</p>
<p>正在悵悵納悶的當兒。旁座的一位女郎忽然緊蹙雙眉。喊起杭育來。我很吃驚地問伊。伊道。「頭昏目眩肚裏痛」。我曉得伊一定中暑了。忙將口袋裏的春在露。傾在茶盃裏。給伊喝下。約摸十分鐘。便霍然了。伊謝了我。並且問我的姓名。那我却呆住了。因爲路上救急。是很平凡的事。也不必說甚麽眞姓名。我便隨口說「是陳鏗然。」那知這一謊。却反而費了我後文的許多辱舌。</p>
<p>「哦先生。失敬得很。貴公司近來發達得怎樣。前天我瞧見報上。尊夫人琴芳女士。被人用石子擲傷面部。現在傷痕可痊愈了嗎。」伊絮絮地這樣問我。</p>
<p>我那時眞弄僵了。硬着頭皮。索性打着大謊。以冀截住伊的問題。便道「這是新片「舞女血」的廣告作用啊。其實並無這事的。」</p>
<p>伊還不肯截止話端。問道。「聽說舞女血是偵探小說作家程小靑先生編的。可是嗎。男主角是「誰」。伊口若懸河的問我。大約這位女士。也是一個迷咧。</p>
<p>「講到男主角。便是鼎鼎大名的林雪懷」。我這樣有問必答的回覆伊。？「…」？「…」。？「…」。伊的問題多着咧。我却假作打盹。不做理會。</p>
<p>十一點半到寓所。母親還没有睡。可是伊老人家所想望的家鄉風味丨甜醬丨却成了火車中無名氏的失物。這眞是一件旣可惜而又悵恨的事呢。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（八一）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>九日。余在印度。除於文化上新有接觸外。又知動物心理上數要例。茲彙述之。足以證明戰爭由來。不純從唯物上面。而發生於雄性之生理也。一達爾文言。動物雄性互叙。由於爭雌。名爲雌雄淘汰。此異乎馬克司者也。二余從英女士知雄貓　小貓之例。三余從回敎學者知雄熊殺子。四又從養猴博物園中。知雄猴殺雌之例。五又知雄七面鳥（即紫綬雞四川有之）偷食其母　卵之事。亦又知鴨雁等雄禽類毫不問其雛。故養護幼子之責。乃母性天職。七又知母雞并能卵鴨卵。且負責保護與己生者無異。凡此要例。皆證明世界大戰。由於雄性之發動。及雄性之組織。與母性母權保護尙未發展被壓抑所致。馬克司亦說明物質上不平之一部份。用中平公道之義可以解决之。以就中道。乃至印度心理學上之發明。感化力之偉大。亦應采取。以潤澤人類之心靈者也。馬克司惟物史。是與饑者以糧食。而印度甘地新精神之解脫高遠。自由寬大。足以與人類以呼吸之空氣。使狹隘社會得見宇宙之廣大。天之高。地之厚。海之深。日之光。月之華。花草風水自然之美也。印度人告我。資本家不能有良心。有良心難成資本家。甘地用感化力以化之。雖然。物質與精神并用。此中國之中。即中山節制之說也。子比而同之。事事平等。蓋甚難也。</p>
<p>印度多好園。中有一鹿。大如大羊。約八十斤。余問人價幾何。云不過五元至七元。意在中國恐數十元百元也。欲帶回。而船費太貴耳。人云某地孔雀無價。比中國之雞更賤。而吾中國祝孔雀如鳳凰矣。蓋物以罕而見奇。將來必有黃金與土同價之日也。</p>
<p>學校中有一塔。用大理石爲之。朝夕獻香花。余問學生。此何神也。答曰。此智慧之女神。名沙士瓦地。SARSWATI余問凡各校均有之乎。曰。私立校大抵有之。官校不定有也。余按希臘亦有智慧之神。亦是女神。中國若紅樓夢鏡花緣各書。皆主張女智慧過於男子。印度書有女子聰明四倍於男之說。按此證明世界將來若由眞正智慧。必向女性敎育上研究。此印度學校所以奉智慧神女者歟。</p>

<h3>女人女人（二十）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>李先生本來是個好事者，何况又聽說外面的女人是來尋陸榮卿的，自然覺得非去查問一個底細不可。他們就一同跑到外面去，只見那個女人依然坐在門房外面，滿臉堆着失望和憂急的容色，一聲不響的低着頭在揩拭着溢墮的眼淚。</p>
<p>一羣的人走到伊的面前都站住了。</p>
<p>「你找陸榮卿做甚？他是你的什麽人？」李先生開口就發問。</p>
<p>「陸榮卿是我的丈夫，……」伊只回答了這一句，其餘的說話都消咽在眼涙之中了。</p>
<p>李先生一聽見說陸榮卿是伊的丈夫，就覺得這是一個非常重要的發見：他暗暗地想，這是他報復的機會到了；就得到了不少的欣慰。</p>
<p>他故意對伊說：「你到這裏來尋他，是没有用的·老實告訴你，陸……陸太太！你們的陸先生在上海是有了好去處了，除非你到那裏去尋他·」李先生又冷笑了幾聲。一羣人也就議論紛紛起來，有的覺得奇怪，有的覺得悽慘，也有知道陸先生和丁小姐的事的，更覺得這一件事大有好戲可看。</p>
<p>「是啊！我也知道的，而且我也看見過，他在上海有了一個女人哩！我也就是爲了這一件事，來問問他·謝謝你們諸位先生，能不能領我到他那個地方去，我眞是感激不盡！」伊說得聲淚俱下。</p>
<p>「旣然這樣！那麽我告訴了你吧！那個女人姓丁，住在同孚路一千四百五十二號，我領你同去却不方便，就給你雇一個車子送你去吧！」李先生帶着笑說。</p>
<p>小榮的妻子聽得他丈夫有了個下落，就立起身來，向李先生道子幾聲謝，跟着李先生走出了校門。一面由李先生雇了一輛人力車，連車錢也預先付了，送着這位陸太太去尋伊的丈夫。等伊上了車，李先生還高聲地叮囑着說：「記住了！姓丁！同孚路一千四百五十二號！一座小小的洋房裏！門口有一棵樹的！」</p>
<p>車子拉着去了。李先生自然非常得意，回過頭來，就向着那一羣瞧熱鬧的同學們說：「好了！你們等着吧！我們的皇后家裏大槪要熱鬧地做一回逼宫的好戲了！」他一邊說，一邊又哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>一羣人都聽出了滋味來，有幾個一聽得這件事和校中的皇后丁小姐有關，竟想跟將去瞧一個下落，有幾個一聽得這件事和校中的皇后丁小姐有關，竟想跟將去瞧一個下落，却給李先生拉住了，說：「我們明天再去打聽消息吧！現在就去，大家的面子都不好看！」</p>

<h3>糧食東新粳小去半元</h3>
<p>南市　昨日各帮來源約抵二十六七艘、浦存連昨共計四十餘艘、城鄉店銷觀到貨續接、頓現懈淡、兼聞北市反硬、是以成交頗寥、宿次更覺呆木、各貨行情緣昨未開、北市寬限、故以南北離遠起見、今市復評、與昨前價均增、但形勢已趨軟象、人心看緊、近來洋米稍疲、致後形恐有小回未奇、聞得浙省有禁運之說、况内地存積薄弱、故有不易下跌之勢、</p>
<p>新閘　昨常錫蜆子等帮來船四十號左右、早晨臨市者尙稱踴躍、各店號一因國歷小月底、雙方歸漲之期、二乘此檔口添辦存貨、三薄稻上棧三千包、形勢比前漲起六七角、厚粳零戶斛脫近千石、價昂二三尺、蘆洋尖及變元胃淡、價　漲跌、浦東新粳昨抵二百、本街交易呆而不動、形勢軟去半元之譜、</p>
<h3>洋米又落兩三角</h3>
<p>天津帮略有辦裝</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、形勢仍無轉機、良以目前之鋒俏、乃被水災影響、長江帮大辦特辦、本街與囤戶繼之、一號西貢乃跳漲至十六元以上、中次各檔、一致高漲、比之洋米初次到申時、己飛漲有五元以上矣繼因各地水勢略退、所辦之米已足應用、本街有河下米新到接濟、尤不願出高價收買矣、市面隨見軟落、價乃步小至一二元、昨日本客去胃仍淡、存底充足、定貨在途者、不日可到、因此人心更爲向下、照晨間觀察、市面有一蹶直下之勢、繼有天津帮趁小略辦敏黨米、本街及散戶亦跟辦安南粳小絞等米、市形始得立定、但比之五百包、價十四元半至十三元、八角、茄辣地一千包、價十四元、安南粳三百包、價十五元三角、小絞米三百包、價十三元八角半云、</p>
<h3>標粉終於挫落</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平疲之象、因洋麥報價、又小一二角左右、業内外之人心、以廠家續定洋麥、所抛之籌碼均屬實貨且國外過剩之勢、不因中國之需要激增而减退、多頭方面、顧慮及此、未免寒心、故滬寗路一帶之多頭、均逐步回出、祗長江帮仍猛力收進、數達三十萬左右、惟大部份人心不佳、終於挫落也、結果八九月份較前日跌一分半十月份跌一分二厘半、十一月份小二厘半、十二一月份小五厘云、</p>
<h3>期麥疲怠不前</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、均趨疲滯不前之態、以本月份之大戶多頭、已乘高漲時完全脫手、目下之多頭、全係外行多頭、致勢力不敵空方、逐步壓小、遠期各月份、因洋麥之過剩、未免心虚、致隨市回出者、頗形暢盛、結果本月份及九月份均較前日跌三分、十月至十二月份跌四分、現麥因到貨不湧、勢呈擯局、開儀微·雙鳳·安亭·浦東·唯亭·蓬萊外崗麥二千一百包、由福新華豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>南北貨蘭谿蜜棗已登新</h3>
<p>蜜棗現蘭谿貨已繼續登塲、貨品尙佳、昨市秃秃行盤呌售四十兩、其餘上下檔仍照向例加退趨勢尙屬平舠、頂上徵貨尙未運到、大約稍俟幾日亦可見新矣、</p>
<h3>絲茶雙宫長吐開價不廉</h3>
<p>價開一百六十四兩：雙宫繭價依然堅漲</p>
<p>今歲江浙各屬雙宫繭産歉折、而雙宫絲廠需要較增、加以各日莊乘機放價搜購、致繭價步漲、雙宫長吐價亦堅俏、昨由三进進雙宫絲廠長吐十五担、價開一百六十四兩云、</p>
<h3>黃白廠經歐莊補空</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市歐銷仍無起色、查海外絲電仍鮮轉滬、昨祇英法兩莊補充黄白廠經缺貨、計怡和等進滬白廠經二十包、川黄廠經十包、價均堅挺云、</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉一漲再漲</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路之珍眉綠茶英莊協和怡和錦隆同孚等行、鑒於市上存底枯薄、來源稀少、國外需求孔亟、又復崛起搜辦、抽蕊珍眉頂盤開至二百五六十兩、婺北珍眉、開至一百七八十兩、屯溪普通珍眉開至一百三十兩、較前提高二三十兩、其漲風有如靑雲直上、其餘針眉秀眉大帮等項、亦均一律提漲五六兩、即貢熙一項、日來爲數行家、紛紛收買改製他項花色出口、市面頓趨堅硬、茶市大勢、已呈極穏之象云、</p>
<h3>疋頭過江赴宴嗶嘰暢銷</h3>
<p>近來元常藍灰素嗶嘰、買方已有需辦之訉、尤以川帮進胃最健、其普通二兩二三錢檔子者格外軋缺而暢銷、寗豐一二三四過江赴宴嗶嘰昨日成交十餘箱、俱是該行自已現貨、秃藏爲二兩二錢八分半凈盤、藍灰二兩三錢五分、墨綠一兩九錢装市銷頗形暢達、客方績有進胃、聞該行新貨未有到申、棧中所存有限、不日即將酌加數分銀子一碼云、</p>

<h3>National Government Establishes</h3>
<h3>Relief Committee for Flood Victims</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Appointed Chairman</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government decrees: Appoints Song Ziwen, Xu Shiying, Liu Shangqing, Kong Xiangxi, and Zhu Qinglan as members of the Flood Relief Committee, and appoints Song Ziwen as Chairman. Furthermore, it is decreed that, due to reports of severe floods in various provinces and immense suffering of the people, the Executive Yuan has been ordered to dispatch personnel for thorough investigation and unified relief efforts. The breadth of the disaster area and the scale of the damage this time are unprecedented in a century. All temporary relief, post-disaster remediation, and fundamental proposals for disaster prevention should concentrate resources from all parties, apply specialized knowledge, and be rationally planned and implemented. Therefore, a Flood Relief Committee is specially established, and Song Ziwen, Xu Shiying, Liu Shangqing, Kong Xiangxi, and Zhu Qinglan are appointed as members, with Song Ziwen concurrently serving as Chairman. The committee members are to swiftly prepare and urgently proceed to meet the government's profound concern for the disaster victims. This decree. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>River Continues to Rise</p>
<h3>Wuhan Extremely Panicked</h3>
<p>River Water Continued to Rise by Three Inches Yesterday</p>
<p>Many Homes Collapsed in Hankou</p>
<p>Concessions Levee Breached</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river water continued to rise by about three inches on the fourteenth, totaling fifty-one feet and eight inches, and was still rising rapidly in the evening. According to reports, the rivers of Sichuan and Xiang have another eighty feet to reach Hankou. The Bulimen Warehouse collapsed and crushed two houses in Tongfeng Lane. Many other houses also collapsed. Street transportation relies mostly on boats, and rickshaws are about to disappear. The situation is extremely serious. If the flood continues, water and electricity may be cut off, and the people will be in dire straits. The Emergency Relief Association, considering the extraordinary severity of the disaster in Hubei, telegraphed the central government and Jiang, etc., on the fourteenth, requesting the prompt allocation of emergency relief to save the dying disaster victims. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) At 1:15 AM this morning, the levee of the Japanese concession was again on the verge of danger. Since last night, Japanese residents and marines on all-night alert have been fully mobilized and are making every effort to repair the levee. However, the first levee was ultimately breached. (Fourteenth Electric Communication Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) At 2 AM this morning, the Mitsubishi Wharf in the Japanese concession suddenly faced imminent danger. The muddy current rushed in, and the raging waves surged. Japanese marines stood upright in the water as human pillars, with the water reaching their heads, fighting the rushing current with their physical strength. It was not until 4 AM that the water was blocked at the second levee. The marines are still continuing their brave struggle in the muddy current, aided by the searchlights of the warship Hirado. The area has become a complete battlefield. Japanese women have all mobilized for rear service, working hard to cook, etc. However, the water continues to rise. (Fourteenth Electric Communication Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The flood has been raging for seventeen days. The Japanese concession, which has been fighting continuously, is facing increasingly severe water pressure and deeper flooding due to the daily increase in the Yangtze River's water volume. In front of the Japanese Consulate General, the water had reached three feet by 2 PM today. Therefore, it was necessary to abandon a section of Yamazaki Street in the central part of the street. South of Bannan Alley, at 1 PM, the warships Hirado and Ataka dispatched marines to land and engage in a final battle against the raging muddy current. Furthermore, due to water surging in various parts of the concession, flooding and leaks in the Chinese streets, all roads in the concession, except for the central part and the pavement, have been completely flooded. The water is still rising, and a third levee is currently being built. (Fourteenth Electric Communication Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Since yesterday morning, the water volume of the Yangtze River has increased even more. The number of civilian houses collapsing and being washed away inside and outside Hankou city, as well as the people drowning,</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>is countless. The damage to property is impossible to estimate. Chinese officials are at a loss and can only stand by and watch. Disaster victims float in the water, accompanied by corpses. The sounds of wailing are unbearable to hear. Their time of death is only moments away. Even the Japanese concession, which stands alone, has reached a final major crisis. The three towns of Wuhan, with a population of 1.8 million, are now on the verge of complete destruction. (Fourteenth Electric Communication Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) At 3 PM yesterday, the Yangtze River water level finally broke through fifty-two feet. The water level in the entire city is rising at an average rate of half an inch per hour. Two-thirds of the Japanese concession is also flooded. The night is most worrying. Half of the Japanese residents are currently engaged in waterproofing their homes, while the rest are assisting the marines in waterproofing the concession. (Fourteenth Electric Communication Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water volume has increased sharply in Hankou since yesterday. For example, in the Third Special District (former British concession), the water depth is more than ten feet. The First Special District (former German concession) and various factories have all been unable to operate since yesterday. All announced temporary closures today. As a result, more people are losing their jobs, creating an unstable atmosphere among the workers. Citizens are increasingly uneasy. All banks and companies are now completely closed. (Fourteenth Electric Communication Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) At 2 AM this morning, the levee of a wharf in the former German concession, close to the upper part of the Japanese concession, suddenly collapsed. In an instant, it turned into a large lake, a vast expanse of water. Because it was late at night, the damage was very great. (Fourteenth Electric Communication Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Relief Committee Agrees On</p>
<h3>Relief Fund Allocation Method</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Relief Committee held its first committee meeting on the fourteenth, chaired by Xu Shiying. It was resolved that: (1) The government be requested to order the relevant ministries and commissions to promptly implement water management plans and to notify all provincial governments to instruct the construction departments to be responsible for investigating the flood situation and paying attention to prevention; (2) The Ministry of Finance will allocate two million yuan in salt tax treasury bonds to be used as relief funds. One million in cash has been mortgaged in Shanghai and will be allocated as follows: (A) 170,000 to Anhui and Hunan each; (B) 170,000 to Hubei, with 70,000 allocated to Hankou City; (C) 130,000 each to Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Henan; (D) 80,000 to Zhejiang; (E) 20,000 for epidemic prevention in Hankou; (3) 10,000 will be allocated to Sichuan Province for emergency relief. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Shiying stated that the extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster situation this year are unprecedented. The emergency relief funds have already been used to mortgage treasury bonds for one million in cash, but this is only a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that all parties will generously assist to make it effective. As for the ten million in disaster relief bonds, according to Yu Meisun, the Director of the National Treasury, Minister of Finance Song has been in contact with bankers in Shanghai, hoping to raise the full amount at once to jointly support this righteous cause. The banks also expressed sympathy and said that in the past, when public bonds were issued, a certain amount of cash would be mortgaged in advance, and the remaining amount would be paid or transferred later. This time, the relief bonds will definitely be fully allocated in cash to help the disaster victims. Xu is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the fifteenth to raise funds and distribute emergency relief from the ministry, and will return to Beijing in a few days. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>China International Famine Relief Commission</p>
<h3>Raising International Relief Funds</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The China International Famine Relief Commission estimates that the flood area this year is about one thousand square miles, and the loss of crops and houses is currently estimated at 300 million yuan, which is equal to the total amount of China's internal and external debt. Now, using more than ten million yuan to handle disaster relief is only three percent of the required amount. What is needed now is work-for-relief, such as dredging rivers and building embankments. If only distributing relief funds as before, the disaster victims will only benefit for six months, and no effort will be put into disaster prevention work, which is still too short-sighted. The Americans in the Relief Commission are currently discussing raising international relief funds. At the same time, they hope that the Chinese civil war will end as soon as possible, because the value of one shell is enough to save dozens of lives. Although this year's disaster is not directly affected by military affairs, if there is no civil war for many years, one-tenth of the military expenditure can be used for disaster prevention equipment, so that even if natural disasters occur, they will not be so helpless. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Errors Occurred in the Higher Civil Service Examination</p>
<h3>Chief Examiner Dai Impeaches Himself</h3>
<p>Liu Xizhang's Exam Score Was Miscalculated</p>
<p>Dai Zai's Mansion Submitted an Emergency Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government announced on the fourteenth that Chief Examiner Dai, concurrently, spoke earnestly at the Standing Committee meeting, reflecting on his past. At 8 AM on the fourteenth, at the eighth Standing Committee meeting of the National Government, Chief Examiner Dai, wearing a solemn expression, entered the meeting and submitted an emergency report. The general idea was that the details of the Higher Civil Service Examination have been reported in a separate document. Last night, he was suddenly informed by Chen Daqi, the Secretary-General of the Examination Committee, that in the examination results, one candidate named Liu Xizhang, who took the examination for Diplomatic and Consular Officials, had his exam score miscalculated, resulting in his failure to pass. After hearing the news, Chuanxian was extremely anxious and immediately rushed to the Examination Committee late at night to investigate and learned that the report was true. Chuanxian deeply reflected that he personally served as the chief examiner this time, braving the summer heat to enter the examination compound and preside over the matter. He originally intended to experience whether all examination regulations were sound, on the one hand to increase his own experience, and on the other hand to establish a long-term model for the future of examinations. Unexpectedly, due to inadequate planning and lax supervision, this unfortunate error occurred in the first Higher Civil Service Examination since the implementation of the examination system. The issue of whether to accept or reject Liu Xizhang alone is minor, but the impact on the future of the examination system is significant. The reasons for the error are no more than two: first, the calculation personnel were not sufficiently skilled; second, the calculation personnel worked for too long and were overly fatigued. However, both of these are not the responsibility of the calculation personnel. The major responsibility lies solely with Chuanxian personally. Since Chuanxian and others entered the examination compound, everything within the compound can be described as extremely tense. From the Examination Committee members to the clerks, almost everyone worked day and night, neglecting sleep and meals. Their hard work and fatigue had reached an extreme level. Furthermore, the review of the Diplomatic and Consular Official examination papers was the latest, and the time for scoring was the shortest. At that time, the Secretary-General had also observed that the original scoring personnel were either sick or fatigued and requested an extension of the deadline and the addition of personnel. Chuanxian, considering that candidates should not wait in Beijing for too long, that each Examination Committee member had their own tasks and was eager to leave the examination compound, and that the premises borrowed from the Nanzhong School had to be returned as soon as possible, did not grant the extension. Instead, believing that the existing staff could still work hard, and to ensure a smooth and rigorous process, he ordered the original small number of staff to work day and night, rushing to complete the calculations within the deadline. Because of this, the working hours of each staff member were extended to more than sixteen hours, resulting in excessive fatigue and this error. If Chuanxian had planned more thoroughly and managed appropriately from the beginning, the error would not have occurred. Now that a major mistake has been made, it would be unfair to the concurrently serving Chief Examiner and President of the Examination Yuan to not impose a severe punishment and instead blame the exhausted subordinates. This would result in unclear rewards and punishments, the collapse of discipline, and the government's prestige would be lost. The spirit of the examination system would also not be established. Chuanxian asks himself in good conscience, how can he face the people, the party, and the country, and even more so, how can he face the Premier who created the Five-Power Constitution? All that has been stated above comes from sincerity and is by no means pretentious. Chuanxian had previously informed the President of the Yuan that his ancestral graves in his hometown had been flooded and planned to request a week's leave after the examination affairs were completed to return to his hometown. Now that this matter has occurred, if the government does not impose a punishment, he will have no face to return to worship his ancestral graves. Therefore, he does not hesitate to submit a request to the government for dismissal from office and investigation in order to rectify discipline. His attitude was very sincere when he spoke, and his words were particularly poignant when he mentioned the establishment of the examination system. All the committee members present were deeply moved by Chief Examiner Dai, concurrently's strict self-criticism and deep love for the party and the country. After repeated discussions, the meeting lasted for three hours without adjourning. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government announced on the fourteenth the emergency self-impeachment document of Dai Chuanxian, stating that the examination was advocated by the Premier and strongly followed by the Party and the Government. This time, Chuanxian volunteered to serve as the chief examiner for the sake of thorough investigation, but such a serious error occurred, which he was extremely horrified by. Therefore, he made a special report on the facts and requested the government to severely punish Chuanxian for the responsibility of improper handling in order to warn against dereliction of duty and promote law and discipline. Chuanxian has been in charge of examination administration for nearly three years and knows that his talent is insufficient. He has repeatedly requested the central government to select capable people, but has not been permitted. This thorough investigation has made him even more aware of Chuanxian's lack of experience, resulting in the failure to properly handle various tasks. In addition to the punishment that should be received in the position of Chief Examiner, the various derelictions of duty in the position of President of the Yuan should especially be severely punished. As for the responsibility of the Secretary-General, his situation is equal to that of the department, and it is also the fault of Chuanxian's inadequate planning. Regarding the calculation error, he has already ordered the Secretary-General to immediately convene the internal examination supervisors of the Examination Committee and the directors and deputy directors of the Examination Office to wait for orders at the Examination Yuan at 2 PM today. As for the responsibility that the Chief Examiner and the Committee Chairman should end from today, Chuanxian should supervise his subordinates to expedite the handling. However, regarding this case, Chuanxian, as a person who has been suspended from duty pending investigation, should recuse himself. Please ask the government to appoint other personnel from the Examination Committee to be responsible for handling it. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Daqi intends to handle the punishment for dereliction of duty, saying that the responsibility for this error should be fully borne by Daqi. This Higher Civil Service Examination is the first major national talent selection, and Daqi concurrently served as Secretary-General. He should be cautious and thorough to ensure that he is worthy of his position. However, due to inadequate planning, a major error was caused. He should submit a request to the President to forward to the National Government for severe punishment. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Separate Arrangements for Accommodation and Training</h3>

<h3>Note for the Recovery of Concessions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since this year, the diplomatic authorities have been focusing on extraterritorial jurisdiction negotiations. Recently, with the occurrence of the Korean incident, the people's attention has been focused on this. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still constantly working on the recovery of concessions, investigating the origins, durations, and processes of the leases, compiling tables, and formulating preparations for negotiations. It is said that proposals for requesting the return of concessions in China, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, and Guangzhouwan, held by countries such as Britain, Japan, France, and Italy, have been drafted. It is also reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has drafted a note regarding the recovery of concessions, which will be handled in two steps. The first step is to select those that should be recovered immediately, and the note will be sent out soon. The rest will be handled in the second step, with the hope of making considerable progress this year to conform to the sequence of Mr. Wang's previous declaration. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>

<p>Wuhu Zhu Dian'an's Important Announcement: This month, on the 8th, the Wuhu County Rectification Committee sent a letter to the county government (the text of which stated: "Regarding the matter of ordering a summons, the Wuhu County Party Affairs Rectification Committee's letter states that during the 60th committee meeting, item 7 of the discussion matters resolved that the local bully Zhu Dian'an, formerly in the Finance Management Office, has already been accused and should be removed from his position as Deputy Director of the Clearing and Suppression Bureau by the county government, and temporarily placed under supervision pending submission to the Provincial Rectification Committee for review. The record is on file, and we hereby send this to you for your information and action, and we hope to receive a reply, etc." This has been approved and is ordered to be executed. Therefore, the police are ordered to immediately bring Zhu Dian'an to the government for verification, without any delay whatsoever.) Regarding the matters handled by Dian'an during his time in the Finance Management Office, the entire county had already legally organized a review committee to investigate and report to the provincial government. Dian'an has not been accused of any wrongdoing. The County Rectification Committee first refers to Dian'an as a local bully, then claims that Dian'an has been accused, first requests his removal from the position of Deputy Director of the Clearing and Suppression Bureau, and then requests his summons and supervision. Dian'an is ignorant and unable to comprehend what they mean by "local bully" or "being accused," or what facts they are based on. Furthermore, it is unclear what legal basis they are using to request his removal or summons and supervision. The Provisional Constitution clearly stipulates that no one's freedom shall be infringed upon except in accordance with the law, and the National Government has repeatedly emphasized this. The County Rectification Committee would not arbitrarily call Dian'an a local bully; there must be a specific natural person responsible for proposing or instigating this to deceive and harm him. However, cases of local bullies should be exclusively under the jurisdiction of the local court. Even if the county government concurrently handles judicial affairs, it fundamentally has no power to accept such cases. Requesting an illegal infringement from an agency without the authority to accept it is not acceptable. Dian'an would not forgive those who acted out of ignorance of the law or remain silent and suffer their illegal harm. Regarding the claim of "being accused," the accusation has another person in charge, another agency in charge, and its reporting conclusion has its case file. No third party may interfere arbitrarily. Furthermore, Dian'an's appointment as Deputy Director of the Clearing and Suppression Bureau was made jointly with Director Yu Zheng by the Department of Civil Affairs. According to the administrative system, how could they request the county government to directly remove Dian'an? All of these actions clearly violate the law, and Dian'an cannot tolerate this injustice. In addition to submitting a complaint to the Provincial Rectification Committee regarding the County Rectification Committee's illegal actions and requesting the Wuhu Local Court to investigate the local bully to clarify the matter and punish those who made false accusations to the County Rectification Committee, I am also requesting the Wuhu County Government to immediately stop accepting matters beyond its authority. I fear that various sectors will not understand the truth, so I am publishing this announcement for their attention. August 9, Year 20. Zhu Dian'an</p>

<h3>The Importance of Ambassadors to the United States and Germany</h3>
<p>The positions of ambassadors to the United States and Germany have remained vacant for a long time since the departures of Mr. Wu Chaoshu and Mr. Jiang Zuobin. Whether this is due to careful selection or other reasons, it is difficult for outsiders like us to guess. However, given the importance of the United States and Germany in the international arena and their close relationship with our country, and in this time of rapidly changing global circumstances, it seems inappropriate for these ambassadorial posts to remain vacant for so long. If we are sacrificing affairs for the sake of personnel, then this reporter emphatically believes that it is even more unacceptable.</p>
<p>The United States is one of the world's three great powers and the world's golden nation. The economic power of Wall Street in New York is not only sufficient to enslave Europe but also to influence the world. On the international political stage, the United States has enormous power. Towards our country, on the one hand, it seeks to break the established spheres of influence of the great powers to gain a share of the benefits, so it often adopts a moderate approach in its diplomacy. On the other hand, it also often subtly uses "force" to restrain the actions of the great powers. It will undoubtedly be a major protagonist in the future of the Pacific situation. In other words, its relationship with our country is extremely important. Germany's international standing is far from what it was before the Great War, and it is under international economic constraints. Its national strength is often in a precarious state. However, its people are able to revive with a spirit of perseverance and struggle, and its diplomats are able to defend themselves with skillful tactics, leveraging the Soviet Union to increase its importance and Western Europe and Britain as support. Its position is sufficient to stir up the situation in Europe. Moreover, its industrial talent is undoubtedly among the best in the world, and its importance in the world's cultural position goes without saying. Although our country does not yet have close ties with Germany, seeking future cooperation in industry to develop our national industry is also extremely important. Therefore, our country cannot delay the selection and dispatch of ambassadors to these two countries. The position of ambassador is related to the interests of the nation and the image of the international community. The selection of personnel must be done with great care. We should seek those with integrity, practical knowledge, the ability to adapt to circumstances, profound knowledge, the ability to discern people's hidden motives, and the spirit to carry out revolutionary diplomacy. We need not focus on familiarity with diplomatic etiquette or fluency in foreign languages, or superficial skills such as being accommodating in interpersonal interactions. Furthermore, we should employ people based on their talents, and employ them in positions that suit them. The way to govern is to first seek impartiality. Impartiality leads to clarity, and clarity leads to the ability to select true talent, so that talent can be used effectively and the country can benefit from its talent. Otherwise, even with an ambassador, it would be equivalent to having none, and it would not benefit the country. This is what we should pay attention to first when selecting ambassadorial talent.</p>

<h3>All-India Congress</h3>
<h3>Rejects Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>Authorities Collect Land Taxes, Abuse Authority</p>
<p>Gandhi Expresses Dissatisfaction with Viceroy's Reply</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 13th - The All-India Congress Working Committee has decided not to participate in the Indian Round Table Conference to be held in London this autumn, because Gandhi considers the Viceroy's reply regarding the collection of taxes in Gujarat unsatisfactory. Gujarat is Gandhi's hometown. Gandhi recently wrote to the Viceroy, pointing out the abuse of coercion in the collection of land taxes, in violation of the Irwin-Gandhi Agreement of March. The Viceroy replied, denying any violation of the agreement and rejecting the request to appoint impartial personnel to investigate the matter. The All-India Congress is displeased and has therefore decided to reject the Round Table Conference. Gandhi told a Reuters reporter today that, to his knowledge, there is no immediate question of resuming the non-violent resistance movement, nor is there a question of renegotiating the All-India Congress' participation in the Round Table Conference with the Viceroy. However, the Irwin-Gandhi Agreement need not be terminated as a result. The All-India Congress will make various efforts to seek an honorable solution, he said. Mrs. Naidu and Malaviya, both affiliated with the All-India Congress, have canceled their trips to England.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 14th - Responsible sources believe that efforts to persuade the All-India Congress to participate in the London Round Table Conference are still underway and have not been abandoned. Sapru has telegraphed Gandhi and Jayakar from Simla regarding this matter. Although the request for Gandhi to appoint impartial personnel to investigate the collection of land taxes cannot be implemented, the Viceroy and the Acting Governor of Bombay are now willing to investigate the various matters that violate the Delhi Agreement.</p>
<p>British Government Schedules</p>
<h3>Special Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>To Consider Committee's Financial Proposals</p>
<p>Next Budget Must Be Balanced</p>
<p>Efforts to Reduce All Expenses</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - A special cabinet meeting is now scheduled for August 19 to consider the proposals of the cabinet's special economic committee.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th - Reuters has learned from responsible sources that the cabinet's economic committee has firmly decided that the budget must be balanced, and the fundamental principles used are equal sacrifice and effort from all aspects of the nation as a whole. All expenses are assessed from the perspective of implementing necessary administrative reductions. The methods to be adopted have now been decided, and the Treasury Department is now studying the detailed proposals submitted to the committee on Sunday. According to reliable sources, the committee is well aware that the British financial position is generally sound. Recent changes in the British gold exchange rate are purely superficial and have no connection with the general state of national finances. The current situation is temporary, so temporary methods must be used to deal with it. A responsible opinion was expressed, believing that if the various recommendations of the economic committee need to be implemented one by one, then there is a need to create several bills, and the House of Commons will need two sessions to pass them. However, the current position requires necessary reforms to be implemented as quickly as possible, without delay. The cabinet committee will continue to meet until the work is completed. If legislation is indeed required to implement any proposals, the House of Commons should be convened as soon as possible. The government does not acknowledge that the meeting between the leaders of the Conservative and Liberal parties and the Prime Minister is a prelude to the establishment of a three-party meeting. The final proposals will of course be the sole responsibility of the government, but it is hoped that the leaders of the opposition parties will be consulted at any time to obtain their maximum agreement on the proposed bills. If broad reduction measures are adopted, the automatic exchange of war debts and other government securities will not be difficult. Responsible sources stated that rumors that Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden intended to use a forced exchange plan are unfounded. Conservative Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain entered the Prime Minister's residence to confer for over an hour after the cabinet committee adjourned. Liberal Samuel also met with the Prime Minister. Neville Chamberlain told a Reuters reporter that no concrete proposals were submitted during the meeting with the Prime Minister. The current situation is indeed very serious, but it can still be salvaged. The government should quickly and clearly express its intention to urgently adopt the necessary methods to balance the budget, so that foreigners know that the British government is serious about handling matters, he said. Baldwin returned to Paris tonight, and Neville Chamberlain also went to Scotland, but can return to London immediately if necessary. According to informed sources, the government will propose a new financial plan, stipulating active frugality, and a temporary parliament will be convened around September to pass it.</p>
<p>US Department of Agriculture Suggests</p>
<h3>Destroying Cotton Production to Maintain Market Price</h3>
<p>Above Image: Man-made market manipulation</p>
<p>Many mock it as sleep-talking</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 13th—After the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Stone telegraphed the governors of the fourteen cotton-producing states yesterday, proposing to destroy one-third of the cotton planted in cotton fields to reduce production and maintain market prices, cotton merchants here ridiculed the idea, seeing it as an attempt to create artificial forces in the world cotton market. However, today the New York market opened with a rise of $1.20 per bale. Although it subsequently fell, the closing price was still higher than yesterday.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 13th—Although the governors of the fourteen states have yet to respond to the Department of Agriculture's proposal to destroy cotton production, there has already been negative feedback from various quarters today. Cotton brokers in New York and New Orleans have received comments from across the country, mostly viewing this proposal as akin to talking in one's sleep. Most experts also believe that the government is merely making empty threats, arguing that if the government genuinely wants to stabilize market prices, it should first burn the 1.1 million bales acquired by the Department of Agriculture's Cotton Stabilization Corporation. If it only wants to compel cotton planters to destroy the cotton in their fields, it is highly doubtful whether farmers will be willing to comply.</p>
<h3>Cuban Revolutionary Situation</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Havana, 13th—The Cuban revolutionary situation is chaotic. Today, the president, accompanied by forty armed guards, boarded a train in Havana and departed. The destination was initially unannounced, leading to widespread rumors of a major victory for the revolutionary army and a potential siege of the presidential palace. However, officials soon announced that the president was heading to Santa Clara because the enemy forces there were already showing signs of surrender. There are also widespread rumors that the president will meet with the leader of the revolutionary army, the former president, to negotiate a ceasefire. Recently, government forces announced that the rebels on the outskirts of Havana have been surrounded, and the government hopes that the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) will surrender as soon as possible to avoid further bloodshed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cuban Capital, 13th—Alarming news is constantly arriving from the interior, reporting that tens of thousands of rebels have risen in revolt. Fighting broke out 150 miles southeast of here, lasting eight hours. The outcome is unknown, but rifle fire can be heard from afar. The number of rebels in the area is unclear, but the government claims to be able to deploy 12,500 troops, plus 2,000 marines. If necessary, this number can be doubled. The bombs and military supplies used by the rebels were manufactured in Europe.</p>
<p>Reuters, Havana, 14th—The Cuban president has issued an order announcing that all rebels who surrender their weapons within 24 hours will be pardoned. Plans to suppress the rebels are still underway. Retired generals and reservists have been called up. The National Congress has suspended its sessions.</p>
<h3>Discord Between Hungary and Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>Czech customs officials assaulted and detained by Hungarian border guards</p>
<p>National News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 13th—Hungary and Czechoslovakia have fallen into discord over border incidents, with public sentiment running high in both capitals. Narrow-minded nationalist newspapers are even promoting economic severance. The dispute stems from the detention of two Czech customs officials in Hungarian territory, allegedly for drunkenness and verbal abuse. However, according to the Czech side, the two customs officials are still being detained and were brutally beaten without cause by Hungarian border guards. The British and French ministers to both Hungarian and Czech capitals visited the foreign ministers today, urging reconciliation and suggesting the formation of an international commission of inquiry to arbitrate the matter.</p>
<h3>Topography of Greenland</h3>
<p>German expedition publishes report</p>
<p>National News Agency, Danish Capital, 13th—The German Greenland expedition today reported to the Royal Scientific Society that the ice sheet in the interior of Greenland is approximately 8,000 feet thick. It also stated that Greenland is roughly shaped like a pot, with high mountains surrounding it and the central part depressed by the weight of the ice sheet. It further noted that, according to observations, the massive icebergs along the coast are gradually moving slowly towards the deepest part of the center, suggesting that land may emerge beneath the ice sheet in the future.</p>

<h3>More Troubles Coming to French Possessions</h3>
<p>Moroccan chieftain escapes from isolated island</p>
<p>But news awaits confirmation</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 13th—The renowned Moroccan Rif chieftain Abd el-Krim, who previously launched an uprising against French and Spanish forces, inflicting heavy losses on them, finally surrendered in 1927 due to exhaustion. The French government confined him to an isolated island. According to evening newspapers, Abd el-Krim has escaped. However, the Ministry of Colonies has yet to receive confirmation. If this news is true, it is like a fierce tiger escaping its cage, and the French and Spanish possessions in North Africa will face further troubles.</p>
<h3>Austrian Communist Organization Uncovered</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 13th—Austrian police today raided the residence of Leibowicz near Aldenburg and uncovered a cadre of a communist organization. It is understood that the police had been observing the residence for several weeks, believing it to be a central hub for the Communist Party, with branches throughout Central and Southern Europe. According to official announcements, a Berlin film company had rented the residence last year. It is rumored that the company was funded by the Soviet film trust. Since then, the tenants have not been frequently present, but unidentified individuals have been seen coming and going frequently, eventually turning it into a headquarters for secret extremist elements from all over Europe. As a result of the search, several people were arrested. After a thorough search, a cellar was discovered, containing a large number of important documents, all of which were seized.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Hubei Flood Relief Emergency Meeting Telegram 1—To all newspaper offices, esteemed colleagues, we now present a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government seeking disaster relief: Since the beginning of summer this year in Hubei province, incessant rain has caused the Yangtze and Xiang rivers to swell dramatically. High ground has transformed into wetlands, and low-lying areas have become vast inundations. The major commercial port of Wuhan has been largely submerged, and dikes in various counties have been breached one after another. Over forty counties have been affected by the disaster, with millions of people displaced. Fields and houses have been inundated, and crops float on the water. People and livestock are swept up and down with the waves. Those fortunate enough to survive are largely homeless and unable to find food. The cries of old and young, men and women, shake the fields, a scene of utter desolation. This is compounded by the ongoing banditry and the exhaustion of reserves. A year of famine and desperate people are particularly worrisome. Disaster relief cannot be delayed for a moment. Witnessing this calamity with deep sorrow and anxiety, Cheng, et al., have jointly initiated the organization of the Hubei Flood Relief Emergency Meeting at the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, which was established on July 28th. In addition to sending telegrams requesting relief and drafting organizational regulations, we are submitting separate requests for filing. We respectfully submit this telegram to your esteemed government for review and earnestly request that you instruct the Central Relief Committee to consider the extraordinary severity of the disaster in Hubei province, unprecedented in recent history, and promptly allocate substantial funds to facilitate the distribution of emergency relief and save the afflicted people. This emergency telegram conveys our urgent feelings and anticipation. Hubei Flood Relief Emergency Meeting Standing Committee.</p>

<p>Hubei Flood Relief Emergency Meeting Telegram 2—To all newspaper offices, esteemed colleagues, we now present a telegram to all provincial and municipal governments, party headquarters at all levels, chambers of commerce, and Hubei native associations, requesting disaster relief: Since the beginning of summer this year in Hubei province, incessant rain has caused the Yangtze and Xiang rivers to swell dramatically. High ground has transformed into wetlands, and low-lying areas have become vast inundations. The major commercial port of Wuhan has been largely submerged, and dikes in various counties have been breached one after another. Over forty counties have been affected by the disaster, with millions of people displaced. Fields and houses have been inundated, and crops float on the water. People and livestock are swept up and down with the waves. Those fortunate enough to survive are largely homeless and unable to find food.

A year of famine and desperate people are particularly worrisome. Disaster relief cannot be delayed for a moment. Witnessing this calamity with deep sorrow and anxiety, Cheng, et al., have jointly initiated the organization of the Hubei Flood Relief Emergency Meeting. In addition to submitting a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government for review and filing, we have long admired your esteemed government ministries and organizations for your compassionate concern for the hungry and distressed, and your benevolent reputation for disaster relief is widely respected. Therefore, we specially submit this telegram, earnestly requesting you to bestow your benevolence upon the afflicted people, solicit substantial disaster relief funds, remit them to our meeting for continuous distribution, and rescue the perishing populace, bestowing upon them the great kindness of providing warm clothing.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>8th Regular Meeting of the National Government</h3>
<p>Resolved to Establish a Flood Relief Committee</p>
<p>Posthumous State Funeral for Former President Tan Set for September 4th</p>
<p>The 8th Regular Meeting of the National Government was held on the 14th, attended by committee members Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, Shao Yuanchong, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Boqun, Wang Zhengting, Ding Weifen, and Dai Chuanxian, with Yu Youren presiding. Matters discussed: (1) Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan and Chief Examiner of the First Higher Examination, reported that after the completion of the examination and the issuance of certificates, it was discovered that one candidate, Liu Xizhang, in the examination for diplomatic and consular officials, had his average score for the first and second exams mistakenly calculated as 51 points instead of the correct 56 points. As a result, he was unable to receive the additional points required to pass. Upon discovery, Dai Chuanxian was deeply dismayed. Although the error was due to the extreme fatigue of the calculation staff, it was ultimately Dai Chuanxian's own fault for inadequate planning. He therefore urgently reported the facts, requesting the government to severely punish Dai Chuanxian for his poor management, in order to uphold the law and discipline. It was resolved that Liu Xizhang, as well as Tu Jin, who was unable to attend the third exam due to flood obstruction as stated in a separate report, should have their cases handled separately according to a prescribed procedure and submitted for review. Regarding Dai Chuanxian's request for self-punishment, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, and Ding Weifen were assigned to conduct a preliminary review. (2) Committee Member Song Ziwen proposed: "The floods in various provinces this year are unprecedented in a century. The government bears a heavy responsibility. Despite the ongoing suppression of the Red Army and the shortfall in tax revenue, we dare not fail to exert our utmost efforts to cope with the situation. Yesterday, 2 million yuan in treasury bonds were allocated to the Disaster Relief Committee for emergency relief. However, the disaster is extraordinarily severe. To plan for the overall situation and seek widespread relief, it is proposed to establish a special disaster relief organization dedicated to this task, paying attention to the following points: 1. Investigation: Based on reliable reports and aerial reconnaissance, clarify the actual situation in each disaster area. 2. Fundraising: In addition to issuing public bonds, solicit donations from home and abroad, and purchase wheat to provide relief. 3. Rehabilitation: Provide farmers with seeds for spring planting next year and use this opportunity to repair dikes for disaster relief. From my observation, fundraising and wheat purchase seem to be easier to implement. However, how to conserve resources and effectively provide benefits to the victims is the most difficult question. It is best to adopt scientific methods of relief used in Europe and America to avoid wasting funds and ensure tangible results. We respectfully request your review and implementation." It was resolved that a Flood Relief Committee should be established, with Song Ziwen, Xu Shiying, Liu Shangqing, Kong Xiangxi, and Zhu Qinglan appointed as committee members, with Song Ziwen serving as chairman. (3) The Office of the Posthumous State Funeral for President Tan reported: "The Office convened the first joint meeting of the State Funeral Committee and the Engineering Committee on the 12th of this month and resolved the following matters: 1. Regarding the date of the state funeral, it is proposed to set it for September 4th of this year. 2. Regarding the state funeral protocol, in addition to the existing State Funeral Law and State Funeral Ritual, several supplementary protocols have been drafted with reference to the State Funeral Ritual for your review and record. 3. Regarding the state funeral expenses, it is proposed to instruct the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to allocate the full amount in advance. 4. Regarding the state funeral eulogy, it is proposed to request your esteemed government to issue it in order to honor the occasion." It was resolved to follow the instructions and proceed accordingly. (4) It was resolved that Shui Zi, a counselor of the government, has been appointed to another position, and the vacancy will be filled by Hai Tao. (5) It was resolved to appoint Yan Dun as the Chief of Staff of the 7th Army Division.</p>
<h3>Details of Yan's Return to Shanxi</h3>
<p>Taking the route from Dalian via Shenyang and the Ping-Sui Railway</p>
<p>Disguised in a kimono and as a villager during the journey</p>
<p>Future itinerary undecided, appears calm</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Yan Xishan's return to his native province via Dalian was reported in yesterday's news, but details were not given as officials had not formally announced it. Today, the Taiyuan Garrison Headquarters invited reporters to announce the details of Yan's return to Shanxi from Dalian. It was stated that he traveled by train, not by plane, which differs slightly from what people from Datong have said. Public attention has been focused on Yan's attitude. The reporter presents the findings of the investigation as follows:</p>
<p>The Journey Back to Shanxi: Yan Xishan, accompanied by Dr. Jin Ruixuan, departed Dalian by train at 9:30 PM on the 3rd of this month. At 7:00 AM on the 4th, the train arrived in Liaoning. After disembarking, he exchanged greetings with several old friends who were waiting for him and then went to the Tokiwa Hotel to rest. After a meal, he boarded the BeiNing train at 10:20 AM and arrived at Fengtai at 10:35 PM. He rested at the Tianhe Inn, west of the station, for over an hour and then took the PingSui train at 11:40 PM. At 3:50 AM on the 5th, he arrived in Datong and rested briefly at a certain mansion. He then took a long-distance bus to Huairen County, where he was met by a private car from the Hebian Village, which he then boarded. At 3:00 PM on the 6th, he arrived at Hebian Village and went to his private residence to rest.</p>
<p>After Arriving in Shanxi: After Yan arrived in Datong, the generals here heard about it. Zhou Dai, commander of the artillery, paid a visit by private car on the morning of the 6th. At noon the next day, Zhang Huizhao, deputy commander of the garrison, also paid a visit by car. Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Sun Chu, and others also arrived by car one after another in the evening to have a long conversation with Yan. The content was mostly reminiscing about their separation. Generals Li Fuying, Feng Pengzhu, Yang Yaofang, and others also traveled by car yesterday to pay a visit. Feng, Yang, Li, Sun, and others returned to Taiyuan this afternoon.</p>
<p>Telegrams to Chiang and Zhang: Yan stated that his return to Shanxi was to visit his relatives. Yesterday, he officially telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang, stating that he had safely arrived in his native Wutai County on the 6th of this month. It is known that Zhao Daiwen, Liang Ruzhou, Sun Huanlun, and others who accompanied Yan to Dalian are still living at No. 263, Section 4, Black Rock Reef in Dalian because the air there is excellent and it is a suitable place to escape the summer heat.</p>
<p>Yan's Attitude: Yan Xishan's sudden return has led to various speculations and conflicting opinions. Some say he is passive, while others say he is active. Those who care about the current situation are all eager to inquire. According to a certain person, Yan himself stated that he was returning to Shanxi to visit his relatives and that his attitude was clearly expressed and did not need to be elaborated upon. However, in my personal judgment, he would not sell out his friends for personal gain, or there may be other private matters.</p>
<p>Rumors of Yan's Visit to Taiyuan: It is rumored that Yan plans to take advantage of his return home to visit his friends in Taiyuan in the coming days to reminisce about their separation. Yan also told the friends who visited Hebian yesterday that he would visit them in Taiyuan. It is reported that a company from the guard battalion has been dispatched to Hebian for security.</p>
<p>Conversation with Escort: Yesterday, the reporter visited Dr. Jin Ruixuan, who accompanied Yan, to inquire about Yan's return to Shanxi. According to Jin, Yan received a telegram from home on the 2nd, stating that his father was ill and hoping that he would return to visit. Yan was very anxious after receiving the telegram and could not sleep well that night. The next morning, Yan suddenly asked Jin if he would take a risk with him and return home to visit his father and treat his illness. Jin immediately agreed and expressed his willingness to accompany him. Preparations were then made for the journey. That evening (the 3rd), Jin, carrying only a handbag, left the residence with Yan, claiming to be going to the beach. At 9:30 PM, they purchased two first-class train tickets and boarded the train, leaving Dalian. Yan was wearing Chinese clothing. At 6:30 AM on the 4th, they arrived in Liaoning and stayed at the Tokiwa Hotel. At 10:20 AM, Yan changed into a Japanese kimono and purchased two first-class tickets for the BeiNing train. There was already a Japanese person in the car. Jin, who had studied in Japan for many years and was proficient in Japanese, began speaking to the Japanese person in Japanese. As a result, the passengers in the car assumed that Yan and Jin were both Japanese, so no one paid attention to them. No one questioned them along the way. At 10:30 AM on the 5th, they arrived in Fengtai and rested at the Tianhe Inn for an hour. Yan disguised himself as a villager and purchased third-class tickets for the PingSui train. At 3:50 AM that night, they arrived in Datong and rested briefly at a certain mansion. They then took a long-distance bus back to Hebian. When they arrived in Huairen County, they were met by Yan's car and transferred to it. At 3:00 PM on the 6th, they arrived at Hebian. When Yan arrived home, his father was lying in bed, suffering from old age. Because of his advanced age and weakness, his appetite was poor, so his condition seemed slightly worse. I (Jin) took his pulse, prescribed medicine, and left that night from Yan's residence by car to the provincial capital. Jin plans to go to Hebian again tomorrow to visit Yan's father. Jin Ruixuan, courtesy name Xiangyuan, is a doctor of medicine from Huguan County in this province. He used to be a professor at Hebei University. He followed Yan to Dalian last year and returned to Shanxi with Yan this time.</p>
<p>Itinerary Undecided: According to those who returned from visiting Yan in Wutai, Yan said little about the current situation to the visitors, except to reminisce about their separation. When asked about his future itinerary, Yan only said that he would decide in a few days. Judging from his attitude, he seems very calm. Yan departed from Datong with Zhao Chengzhou and others at approximately 7:00 AM on the 6th. When they arrived at Yuanping Town in Guoxian County, Zhang Peimei, the former garrison commander of Southern Shanxi, and others were waiting at the station to greet him. Yan invited Zhang to ride in the car with him back to Hebian. Li Fuying and others from Xinxian also came to greet him by car. Yan was wearing a white linen summer shirt, a flat-topped wide-brimmed white straw hat, white socks, and black shoes, and he looked quite energetic (10th).</p>
<h3>Shi Yousan Has Left Shandong</h3>
<p>Han Fuju Has Sent Personnel to Verify Shi's Troops</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the collapse of Shi Yousan's army, there have been various rumors about his whereabouts. According to reliable sources, Shi himself did indeed leave Shandong eastward on the night of the 10th. The route he took, whether by boat from Qingdao, Yantai, or Yangjiaogou, is still unknown. However, it is reported that he first went to Dalian and then to Japan. The scattered soldiers of Shi's army who fled to Shandong have all been concentrated in Linyi, awaiting verification and reorganization. The organization of a division has been confirmed, and Cheng Xixian will be appointed as the division commander. The announcement will be made as soon as Han Fuju requests the Central Government to issue a formal appointment. Cao Fulin, the commander-in-chief of the Third Army Corps, recently came to Jinan to report to Han on the number of Shi's scattered soldiers who fled to Shandong and their concentration in Linyi to await reorganization. Han expressed his satisfaction and ordered Cao to work with Cheng Xixian to be responsible for the reorganization. Cao returned from Jinan to Yucheng by Taishan armored train early on the 11th and then proceeded to Linyi. Han also sent Liu Shuxiang, the chief of the staff department of the Third Route Army Headquarters, to Linyi on the 11th with personnel from the staff, quartermaster, ordnance, and military affairs departments to verify the number of firearms and personnel of Shi's troops in order to carry out the reorganization. According to Liu, he was ordered by the chairman to go to Linyi to verify the troops of Shi's army who came to Shandong and had no other mission. The personnel from the quartermaster and ordnance departments were prepared to distribute supplies according to the actual number of people verified and to prepare a roster to be submitted to the Central Government. If any firearms were missing, they would be replenished after verification. According to Ji Rongtao, the commander of the special service regiment of Shi's army who came to Shandong, he came to Jinan from Linyi last night (the 10th) with regiment commander Bi Wenshan to report to Chairman Han on their arrival in Linyi. The regiment commander paid a personal visit to the chairman early this morning (the 11th) and will return to Linyi within a few days. After the regiment arrived in Linyi, the regiment headquarters was set up outside the South Gate, and the soldiers were stationed outside the city. The city defense is still being handled by the original garrison, led by Commander Li (11th).</p>
<p>Guangdong-Guangxi Armies</p>
<h3>False Rumors of Entering Hunan</h3>
<p>He Jian Prepares to Intercept at Hengbao</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Chiang Dispatches Five Divisions to Assist</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After receiving reports from the front lines that the Guangdong-Guangxi armies were invading Hunan in three routes, He Jian not only forwarded a request to Commander-in-Chief Chiang for the immediate dispatch of large forces to Hunan for assistance but also ordered Tao Guang's entire force to concentrate in Hengzhou to defend the key points. Hengzhou announced martial law on the 6th. Chenzhou, Yongzhou, and other places were instructed to have the commanders of the local militia districts and security regiments mobilize and defend key locations and intercept the enemy as the opportunity arose. At the same time, Zhang Liangji's entire brigade was ordered to defend the key fortress of Baoqing and deploy defenses, and all militia forces from the five counties under Baoqing were mobilized to Baoqing to reinforce the defenses, as both Hengbao are extremely fortified. Yesterday, on the 8th, He Jian also received telegrams from Yongming and Lingling counties reporting the actions of Zhang Gui's army: (1) Tang Mengren, the magistrate of Yongming County, telegraphed that about 1,000 troops from Zhang Fakui's unit were attempting to attack the county seat. (2) Hu Tianxiang, the magistrate of Lingling County, reported that the advance detachment of Tan Lianfang's division of the Guangxi army, stationed at Shaziping, entered Hunan via Yangridu and Huangshahe, reaching Zhuozhu ao, 70 li from Yongzhou. Li Pinxian, Liao Lei, and other units were concentrated in Quanzhou, attempting to invade Hunan. As for the actions of the Guangdong army, according to a telegram from Zhong Yuying, the magistrate of Chen County, Li Yangjing's unit was actively conscripting in Pingshi. A telegram from Bai Xuan (an officer in charge of reconnaissance of the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi) stated that Yu Hanmou's unit, stationed in Lechang, suddenly withdrew towards Shaozhou. It was reported that the Gui-Zhang troops had arrived at the Guangdong border, claiming to invade Hunan but actually advancing towards Guangdong, so they were withdrawn to defend against them, with no intention of invading Hunan. Commander-in-Chief Chiang also telegraphed that the Guangdong-Guangxi invasion of Hunan was in response to Shi Yousan. Now that Shi had been completely resolved, any further invasion would be self-destructive. He had already prepared to dispatch five divisions to Hunan to provide assistance (August 9th).</p>
<p>Hubei Flood Disaster</p>
<h3>Millions of Refugees</h3>
<p>Various Counties Still Report Disasters</p>
<p>Losses Exceed Tens of Millions</p>
<p>Investigation of Responsibility Issues</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The floods in Hubei Province have lasted for many days, with the province's economic heartland almost completely devastated. Reports of disasters from various counties continue to pour in. The severity of the disasters and the extent of the affected areas are truly unprecedented. The disaster situation in various counties is further detailed below.</p>
<p>In recent days, dozens of counties have reported disasters. The most severely affected include Yunmeng County, where over seventy embankments were flooded, with over fifty submerged. In Xiaogan County, all embankments and dikes have collapsed. In Qianjiang County, over one hundred out of one hundred and fifty embankments have been submerged. In Yingcheng County, all dikes and embankments have been breached, causing flooding for hundreds of miles. In Qishui County, the North Yonggan Dike and Yonggu Branch Dike have collapsed, and the Yongbao Dike has also been affected, leading to the submersion of the entire county. In Songzi County, two out of four districts have been completely submerged. In Shishou County, over ten thousand mu of farmland have been flooded. In Mianyang County, all river dikes have collapsed, and the entire city of Xindi has become a swamp. In Huanggang County, all embankments have collapsed. In Hanchuan County, many dikes and embankments have collapsed, and those that have not collapsed have been submerged by accumulated water. In Xianning County, lake water has overflowed, submerging all crops. In Anlu County, mountain floods have erupted, washing away fields and houses. In Luotian County, floods have spread, submerging farmland. In Yangxin County, river water has flowed backward, submerging the northeast, central, and southern townships. In Huangmei County, river dikes have collapsed, and all private embankments have been breached, affecting 200,000 people. In Zhongxiang County, the Huhe and Liangxiang townships have been submerged. In Jiangling County, the Cenhekou area has been flooded. In Tianmen County, the dikes below Yuekou have all collapsed, turning everything into ruins, and there is no way to travel through the east, west, and south townships. In Qichun County, the Yongbao and Yonggu dikes have collapsed, submerging an area of approximately eighty li, with all houses collapsed. In Guangji County, river water has flowed backward. In Luocheng County, eighteen embankments outside the dike and thirty-six embankments inside the dike have collapsed, submerging an area of hundreds of li. In Huangpi County, the eastern, western, and southern areas along the river, spanning over sixty li in all directions, have become a swamp. In Echeng County, over ninety zhang of river dike have collapsed, submerging over ten thousand mu of farmland, collapsing thousands of houses, and causing property losses of over three hundred thousand yuan. In Jiayu County, seven or eight places of official and private embankments have collapsed. The entire county of Gong'an has been submerged. The northwest along the river in Sui County has also been submerged, with water depths of over one zhang in flat areas. In Jianli County, the Xindi dike has breached, and river water has flowed backward into the entire county. The entire county of Yun County has been submerged. In Dangyang County, mountain water has erupted, and the entire county has suffered from the disaster. In Zhijiang County, the areas along the river have been flooded, suffering severe damage. The above information is based on investigations by the Department of Civil Affairs. The disaster situation is relatively mild and those that have not been reported are not included. Approximately tens of thousands of mu of farmland have been submerged, affecting millions of people, and the losses exceed tens of millions of yuan.</p>
<p>The Hubei Provincial Government and the Flood Relief Committee have repeatedly appealed to Chairman Chiang, the Executive Yuan, the Central Relief Committee, and the authorities of various provinces since the occurrence of the flood, sending numerous urgent letters and telegrams. They also negotiated with the Pinghan Railway Bureau, the Special Tax Bureau, and the Unified Tax Bureau to collect additional surcharges on their behalf and issued orders to all agency staff to reduce their salaries uniformly to continue providing relief. Furthermore, due to the large number of victims and the vast disaster area, it was decided to send personnel to various counties to conduct on-site investigations and comfort the affected people. The City Party Department Rectification Committee also convened temporary meetings with representatives from various district party departments, trade associations, and labor unions to discuss relief measures, resulting in the decision on several important cases: (1) request the municipal government to send people to investigate flooded areas daily, prevent house collapses, and order district party departments and mass organizations to report any issues in a timely manner; (2) request the provincial and municipal governments to promptly block the collapsed dikes; (3) request the relief committee and the Public Security Bureau to ban rescue ships from demanding ferry fares; (4) request the municipal government to build wooden bridges to help pedestrians; (5) request the relief committee to strictly prohibit relief personnel from committing violence against disaster victims and ensure widespread distribution of aid; (6) request the garrison department to prevent hooligans from dismantling flooded houses; (7) request the disaster prevention office and the relief committee to provide relief to refugees in the Zongguan area and protect dams. In addition, increasing refugee shelters, ordering refugees to move, and transporting refugees back to their hometowns are all underway separately.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of responsibility for this flood, all parties are paying close attention, and various newspapers have also discussed it from time to time. He Chengjun, the chairman of the province, also intended to thoroughly investigate. The disaster was extremely severe, and the responsible personnel failed to prevent it in advance and failed to respond effectively in an emergency, wasting national funds and harming the people. If they are not severely punished, it will not be enough to appease public anger and warn those in the future. However, He Chengjun stated in his report at the provincial government's memorial week on the tenth that the issue of responsibility cannot be blamed on others, roughly saying, "The recent flood is unprecedented in sixty years. Whether it is due to inadequate human prevention is still under investigation. However, according to numerous reports and my own on-site investigation, it cannot be blamed on others. However, since the news media raised the issue of responsibility, some wanted to use this to attack or deceive, and others with political ambitions took this opportunity to push others off the stage so that they could obtain a considerable position. I have long known about this situation. Today, I originally intended to issue a warning, but friends repeatedly advised me that for every foot the Dao rises, the Devil rises ten feet. Therefore, I can only move forward with enthusiasm and determination, defeat all demons, clarify right and wrong, distinguish truth from falsehood, and rectify people's hearts, so as not to harm society and the country."

<p>Hankou Merchants and People Lost Four Million</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Yangtze River's water level had slightly stabilized since the tenth, and on the eleventh morning, it even receded by an inch or so. The people of Wuhan were celebrating their recovery when, on the evening of the same day, the north wind roared, heavy rain poured down, trees were uprooted, houses collapsed, and the river water continued to rise. On the twelfth and thirteenth, it continued to rise without stopping, reaching a maximum depth of fifty-one feet, five inches, and five points, making the situation even more serious. According to a certain engineer familiar with the water situation, if it rises another eight inches, the three towns of Wuhan will be submerged. The future disaster is even more alarming. I don't know what the authorities will do to deal with the aftermath. The current rescue situation in the three towns is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hankou: The dikes and dams in various places have been greatly affected by the water in recent days, all showing dangerous signs, especially the dikes from Qiaokou to Zongguan in Hankou, which are the most dangerous. There are three dikes here, all ending at Qiaokou. The first is the Sichuan-Hankou Railway subgrade, the second is the Zhanggong Dike, and the third is the Huangjingtang Dike. The Sichuan-Hankou Railway subgrade and the Zhanggong Dike are to prevent the water from the Houhu Lake, the height of the dikes are equal, and the distance is also close. The Huangjingtang Dike is an extension of the Pinghan Railway line, and the distance is also close. The Huangjingtang Dike is an extension of the Pinghan Railway line, specifically to prevent the Xiang River. It is about four feet lower than the Zhanggong Dike. After the renovation, it is only a few inches higher than the river water. Because the Xiang River is calm, it has not collapsed. The Sichuan-Hankou Railway subgrade is close to the flood, and there is accumulated water inside. When the wind was raging on the twelfth, the section of the road from the Pacific Soap Factory to the section of 1312, which is about two li long, was flooded, which was very dangerous. After the municipal government engineering team made every effort to block it, they nailed wooden stakes on the slope of the roadbed, and then added burlap sacks. After a few hours, the waves calmed down a bit and the work was completed, and the danger was turned into safety. The Zhanggong Dike was also protected.</p>
<p>Wuchang: The most dangerous is the Chopsticks Street under Hanyangmen, followed by the Jiangdi River at Datikou, Xujiapeng and other places, and the Lakedi Dam of Saihu Lake. On the thirteenth, a mouth suddenly broke in the Chopsticks Street section, and the river water poured in. The Construction Department sent workers to rescue, and the breach was blocked. The Datikou, Xujiapeng, and Lakedi dams also built sandbags according to the height of the water, and no accidents occurred. However, the sub-dike of the Wuqing Dam, Binsan Dam, was submerged by water, so the nearby Babu Street, Xinqiao, and Xiang'e Road tracks were flooded, but the dam has not been broken. If it is quickly heightened and thickened, it can still block the water.</p>
<p>Hanyang: The embankments in the Heishan, Yangjiahe, and Nan'anzui areas are also in danger. The Disaster Prevention Office has ordered the county government to quickly rescue them, and ordered the Water Conservancy Bureau to send personnel to assist. If the water does not rise again, there may be no worries.</p>
<p>The drainage project in Hankou City started to build wooden dikes on the seventh, and the starting line was completed on the tenth. It was originally scheduled to drain the accumulated water in the city by the twelfth or at the latest fourteenth. Because the north wind suddenly rose and the waves surged like mountains, the wooden dikes along the river were broken by the water, and the original trees were uprooted. The unbroken wooden dikes were submerged by rising water and lost their effectiveness. The drainage plan had to be abandoned. However, the Disaster Prevention Office is still continuing. Yesterday, the Hanxingchang Construction Factory, which contracted the project, was ordered to quickly repair the damaged dams and unfinished projects, and start pumping water on a specified date, and sent personnel to the Electricity Bureau of the Third Special Zone (the former British Concession) to borrow water windmills for use. It is said that each of these windmills can pump 300,000 gallons of water per hour. If the dams are built and the river water does not rise, the drainage plan still has hope of being completed. Moreover, the commercial affairs in Hankou were greatly affected by the flood. The losses of merchants and people are countless. In terms of compensation expenses alone, the daily loss is about 300,000 yuan. The disaster has lasted for more than ten days, and the total loss is 4 million yuan. Including various losses, I am afraid it will not be less than tens of millions of yuan. It can also be seen that the suffering is deep. (August 13)</p>
<h3>Gannannan Red Bandits Were Cut in Two</h3>
<p>Communication Between Xingtai and Xingyu Districts Lost</p>
<p>Three Route Army Advances on Yudu, Fierce Fighting With Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the Suppression Army recovered Donggu, the Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang factions retreated to Xingguo, Yudu, Ruijin, and Huichang, echoed the bandits on the Fujian border, and planned to enter western Jiangxi via Xingguo and Taihe to avoid the Suppression Army's offensive. However, the Suppression Army suddenly recovered Xingguo, and the bandits were cut in two. According to the reconnaissance report by the plane, the main force of the bandits is in the Guanxi and Shacun areas west of Xingguo and east of Taihe, with about tens of thousands of people. They are currently being monitored by the divisions of Gong Bingfan, Luo Lin, and Cai Tingkai. They can't advance and can't retreat. One is in the areas of Liantang north of Yudu and Liangcun and Guantian north of Yongfeng and south of Xingguo, with no less than tens of thousands of people. They are the fake Thirty-Fifth Army of Deng Yigang, the fake Third Army of Huang Gonglue, and the fake Fourth Army of Lin Biao, but they come out at night and dare not engage the Suppression Army. Currently, the Sun Lianzhong Division of the Suppression Army is in Gulonggang, the Shangguan Yunxiang Division is in Longgang, and the Zhao Guantao Division is in Xingguo, all besieging the bandits. The Third Route's Hao Menglin, Zhu Xihuang, and other teachers advanced from Biaohu and Yuexi of Yongfeng at the beginning of the month to Yudu. They encountered tens of thousands of bandits near Liantang and Liangcun between Yu and Xing. From dawn to dusk, they fought fiercely for several days, charging back and forth, and the two sides fought in close combat. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. Later, because the bandits lacked bullets, they mostly used spears and swords to charge. The Suppression Army also fought back with box cannons and broadswords, and finally defeated the bandits. It is said that the Third Route Army rested for a while and continued to advance triumphantly to Yudu. (August 11)</p>
<h3>Mantetsu Establishes Office in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Director Kimura Appointed Director and Arrived in Shenyang to Take Office</p>
<p>When Railway Negotiations Arrive, They Should Begin</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Kimura Ryuichi, Director of Mantetsu, who is the main Japanese figure in the negotiation of the Sino-Japanese railway issue, returned to Japan from Shenyang to attend the Mantetsu Annual Meeting, and asked the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Railways for the latest negotiation strategy. It has been two months. After Uchida Kosai succeeded as president of Mantetsu, he actively reorganized internally and externally, and has already changed its old appearance. Mantetsu in Shenyang has Mantetsu Office and Local Office, Transportation Office, each performing its duties. Recently, it has also been reorganized and a new Mantetsu Fengtian Office has been established to oversee all affairs. The powers are very important. Its director is Kimura Director. He has come to China from Tokyo and arrived in Shenyang at 6:40 am on the tenth to take up his new post. More than 20 other new employees also came to take up their posts. More than 100 people from the official and business circles in Shenyang, Japan, went to the station to greet them, which is enough to show the importance of Kimura's position. After Kimura arrived in Shenyang, he will visit Chinese and foreign agencies with the new staff to express his opinions. His speech is as follows: "Mantetsu has established the Fengtian Office this time for two major reasons. One is internal, that is, the original Mantetsu Office, Local Office, Transportation Office, and other offices in Fengtian, and various agencies will be added in the future. If there is no unified agency, it will be very inconvenient to contact each other. One is external, that is, Fengtian is an important city, and all agencies must be unified. There is a foreign agency representing Mantetsu. The Fengtian Office is based on the above two major reasons to decide to re-establish it. However, the necessity of the office depends on how people handle it. I (Kimura called himself) am determined to do my best to handle it well and exert its functions. I plan to stay here for the time being, and in the future, I will spend four days a week in Fengtian and three days in Dalian, so that the Fengtian Office can be closely connected with the head office. From now on, in addition to supervising the local office and the railway office, it will also take charge of foreign negotiations, and the railway negotiations are the same. When the time comes, it should start." (August 10)</p>

<p>People from Huaiyang</p>
<h3>Establish a Water Conservancy Committee</h3>
<p>Solve the Current Predicament Together Regardless of Borders</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The upper and lower reaches of the canal and the banks along the river are flooded with water in more than 20 counties at the same time. Millions of lives will be in danger. People from all over Yang are very anxious. Therefore, Dai Tianqiu, Yang Jiaru, etc. invited people with more canal-based labor insurance experience from Huaiyang at 2 pm yesterday (13th) to discuss emergency methods and advise the authorities so that there would be no damage to the upper and lower reaches. The meeting address is temporarily borrowed from Dai Tianqiu's private residence. A total of 23 people attended, including Xu Shuhou, Chen Shiyi (Huaiyin), Hao Xingheng, Hao Weihou (Huaian), Liu Lingsheng, Lu Shao Liu (Baoying), Qiao Boyao (Yancheng), Guo Yinhuai, Li Jichen (Xinghua), Yuan Luzhong, Yuan Chengde (Dongtai), Ruan Lianzhong, Bao Xiangzhong (Yizheng), Wang Jingting, Dai Tianqiu, Yang Jiaru, Hu Xianbo, Zhang Shushen, Zhu Ganchen, Zhang Shaozhai, Zhou Xiangting, Chen Jingren, Zhang Dihua (Jiangdu), etc., researched for a long time, and unanimously advocated that the upper and lower reaches should not be considered as a watershed, and the overall goal is to save people's lives. The main points of the discussion were: (1) to suggest the disaster relief methods in the past to the provincial government and request them to adopt them; (2) to announce the road for draining into the sea, and stipulate that each county should elect two people to organize a water conservancy committee in Yangzhou, so that each county can exchange opinions at any time, and the organization method will be determined after submitting the plan to the party department for record. A document was drafted on the spot, requesting Chairman Ye and Director Zhang to order the coastal salt reclamation companies to open more dike gates and destroy each gate to facilitate the draining of water. Representatives were also appointed to go to the province to petition. It was not until 10 pm that the meeting was adjourned. After the news of the opening of Zhaoguan Dam spread, the residents of the downstream counties were shocked several times overnight. Director Li Bao'an came north to supervise the disaster relief work, fearing that someone would steal and open the Zhaoguan Dam, so he sent a platoon of soldiers to guard the dam to prevent any accidents. The incoming and outgoing telegrams regarding the opening of the dam are recorded below: (1) Telegram from Chairman Ye to Director Zhang of Yangzhou, "To Director Zhang of Yangzhou, Sun Director's inspection of the river project, and report back to the province, knowing that your ministry has done an extraordinary job in disaster relief, I am very pleased. After the lower river counties opened all the dams in Chexin, the water from Huai poured down, causing a major disaster, and the situation was tragic. The relationship between Zhaoba is even more important, and we have to consider it carefully. Now we are sending Li Committee Member Shigang to Jiangbei to supervise the counties along the embankment to do their best to protect the embankment, and we will report it to you." (2) Director Zhang replied in a telegram, "I have received the telegram. Protecting the embankment and saving the people is the duty of soldiers, and we should do our best to assist. As you indicated, the relationship between Zhaoba has been telegraphed to Commander Liang." (3) Commander Liang replied to people in the downstream telegram, "I have read your telegram. The issue of opening the Zhaoguan Dam belongs to local administration and should be the responsibility of local officials. This headquarters is only willing to do its best to protect the embankment and prevent disasters for the people." (4) Member Yu Bingtang replied in a telegram, "I have received your telegram and have followed your instructions. I have also met with Chairman Ye, who does not advocate opening it, so I will reply specially." (August 14)</p>

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Baoshan</h3>
<p>The County Chief Goes to the Countryside to Survey the Wilderness: Zhao Enju, the county chief of Baoshan County, has been repeatedly reported by the farmers of each district under his jurisdiction that the rice and cotton harvests are poor, the disaster situation has become a reality, and life is difficult. He has requested relief. County Chief Zhao believes that this is related to the livelihood of the farmers in the county, so he led Wang Decheng, the director of political affairs of the county government, and two political affairs police officers to Yanghang, Liuhang, Dachang, and Luodian townships at 8 am yesterday to conduct on-site surveys of the wilderness and inspect the administrative situation of each district. He is scheduled to continue to Guangfu Shenghua Yuetang and other townships today to survey the wilderness.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Wanted Criminal in the Tong'an Bridge Robbery Case Was Arrested: Xu Yuheng, the son of famous doctor Xu Hedan, went to Jingshu this spring to sweep the tombs, and his relative Liu Yinxuan (a prominent local family) was robbed by bandits while visiting the Taihu Lake. Later, the Liu family received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 30,000 yuan. They then transferred 11,000 yuan to Shen Shoutian, who was introduced by someone, to negotiate with the bandit den. As a result, Shen not only took the money, but also said that the bandit leader Qin Lao San demanded 200,000 yuan before he would release Liu and the others. Therefore, the family entrusted another person to take 14,500 yuan to redeem them. Xu and others were trapped in the bandits for 80 days. Recently, Zhu Mian, the commander of the Taihu Bandit Suppression, learned that Shen Shoutian was actually a disciple of Li Dayou, the leader of the Chaohu gang, who specialized in acting as a bandit line and negotiating ransom tickets for profit. Therefore, yesterday (14th), he devised a way to buy a line and arrested Shen. He confessed that he had defrauded 11,000 yuan and that he had also handled the case of the Tong'an Bridge robbery last year, in which the bandit washed and killed the business group coach Zhu Zuozhou and robbed ten people including teachers and businessmen. He was redeemed by businessmen Jin Peizhi and others for 5,000 yuan. He embezzled 2,000 yuan and so on. After the interrogation, he was immediately detained for instructions.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter Requesting Repairs to the Streets in the City: The County Chamber of Commerce, in view of the fact that the streets in the county have been in disrepair for many years, and the area is full of swamps after a rain. The construction funds of Wuxian County have accumulated a lot. Since it has been collected from the public, it should be used for the public. The city's streets have not been repaired since the street was widened from the 16th year of the Republic of China. Therefore, yesterday (14th), it sent a letter to the Construction Bureau, requesting that the accumulated funds be used to repair the streets in sections.</p>
<p>The Important Criminal in the Xu Zhuang Robbery Case Has Been Arrested: The Xu Zhuanjia, a farmer in the Hengqing Township, Zhuangluo Township, was robbed by bandits the night before, and three people were shot and injured. As mentioned in yesterday's newspaper, it is now known that Zhang Shousheng, a bandit living in the case, has been arrested by the Hengqing Public Security Bureau yesterday (14th). According to the confession, there are five or six accomplices who will take the train to Shanghai at Guandu Lane this evening. He immediately telegraphed the Public Security Bureau, ordering the First Branch to send members with the Criminal Investigation Team to Guandu Lane Station to investigate the remaining bandits.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Organizes a Free Clinic: At the last regular meeting of the county's Chamber of Commerce, it was suggested by Guo Leye that the Chamber should set up a free clinic every summer to help poor and sick people who cannot afford medical treatment. The proposal was approved and the clinic was organized accordingly. Local doctors of various specialties were hired, and on the first day of consultation (the 11th), the clinic was crowded with patients. In the future, consultations will be held on the 1st and 6th of each month to benefit the poor and sick.</p>
<p>Dismantling an Airplane Causes Further Complications: The white airplane under the jurisdiction of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force landed in Xinqiao the other day. This newspaper has reported on it repeatedly. It is now learned that the Shanghai Aircraft Factory sent personnel and 20 workers to Xinqiao yesterday to dismantle the aircraft and transport the parts back. Unexpectedly, the town refused to cooperate with the aircraft staff, agreeing not to provide food or lodging and prohibiting the dismantling of the aircraft. They then requested police protection. Unexpectedly, Han Xiaozhou, an assistant at the district office, came out to oppose it, almost leading to a conflict. Upon hearing the news, the county government's public security bureau immediately dispatched a police team and officers to Xinqiao to suppress the situation and took Han Xiaozhou to Songjiang. They went to the county government. It is said that County Magistrate Shen reprimanded the assistant in person.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Court Thoroughly Investigates the Water Police's Unauthorized Killing: Xie Zezhi, the captain of the provincial water police team stationed in Nantong, was stabbed by his former subordinate Yan Zheming. Yan fled to the front of the court, where he was caught up and shot dead by the water police team. The case is complicated. Yan Zheming's elder brother, Qingshan, came to Nantong to appeal to various parties. The court's prosecutor's office scheduled a preliminary hearing on the 9th to thoroughly investigate the case, summoning Xie Zezhi and officers Wang Fusheng, He Guochang, Xu Zhaobin, Zhang Baoshan, Wu Ruishun, and Lian Hanqing for interrogation. Yan Zheming is currently buried in the public cemetery in the east of the city, and his coffin will be opened for examination.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation Sends a Commissioner to Survey the Riverbank: Due to the severe collapse of the Nantong riverbank, which greatly affects water conservancy and transportation, the Ministry of Transportation has appointed Li Eryi of the Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Commission to come to Nantong to conduct on-site surveys of the riverbank and water flow.</p>
<p>Business Tax Allocation Issues: Nantong's business tax is paid by the Chamber of Commerce at 8,000 yuan per quarter. There are still issues with the allocation of the tax among various industries. The Chamber of Commerce has appointed Li Yinong and six others to work with the business tax bureau to first investigate the capital amount and business volume of each store, and then discuss the allocation method.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs a Request for Investigation of the Vandalism of the Cinema: The Wuxi Grand Theater in the city park was vandalized by twenty to thirty people wearing water police uniforms on the evening of the 12th, causing significant damage. Ticket collectors Xue Guangtao and Yu A’gen were also injured. The incident has been reported to the county court for examination of the injuries and investigation of the perpetrators. Yesterday, the court sent a letter to the county Chamber of Commerce stating that the rioters wore uniforms and armed belts, and after the riot, they gathered in the park for roll call, clearly intending to sabotage the business. The court requested the Chamber of Commerce to uphold justice and find a way to provide relief. The Chamber of Commerce approved the request, stating that the park is a public place, yet people dared to gather and commit violence. What about law and order? Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Shen Gaozhen, the district chief of the Second Water Police District, requesting him to personally come to Wuxi to investigate the case immediately, ensure the arrest of the perpetrators, and severely punish them, and not to simply listen to his subordinates and conduct a superficial investigation.</p>
<p>Two Robberies in Rural Areas in One Day: The crime of robbery is not decreasing in rural areas. The other day, two robberies occurred in one day. The details are recorded as follows: (1) In the area near Luo She, Wang Qiao, in the 16th district (Wananshi), Jiangbei resident Ping A’de lived in a thatched house and had some savings. The other night, four thugs suddenly came from the Yangshuyuan area, one with a pistol and three with flashlights. They broke down Ping's front door, tied up eleven men, women, and children with ropes, searched the house for an hour, and forcibly removed the gold earrings worn by Ping's wife and daughter, firing several shots before leaving. After the thugs entered, Ping had already escaped through the back door and ran to Yanjiadang Business Group to ask for help, but the robbers had already gone far. (2) In the Sheng'an area of Kaiyuan Township, Yuan Yingui and his five sons were all diligent and thrifty farmers, so they had some savings. Unexpectedly, around one o'clock yesterday morning, four robbers, two with flashlights and two with rifles, broke down the door and entered, driving Yuan and his sons into a corner of the room. One robber stood guard with a gun, while the other robbers searched everywhere. They robbed more than twenty yuan in cash, three fur robes, gold and silver jewelry, cotton-padded clothes, etc., with losses estimated at more than three hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Discovery of Triad Gangsters in Xin’an Town: Xin'an Town, in the 13th district (Xin'an Township), is lined with shops and densely populated. It has always been peaceful. Around seven o'clock the other night, more than forty triad gangsters suddenly arrived, traveling on four bandit boats from the direction of South Taihu Lake. They each carried weapons such as pistols, Mauser pistols, and iron rulers. After the bandit boats arrived in town, they swarmed ashore and posted sentries on the streets and alleys. At that time, the merchants and residents of the town were all cooling off on the streets when they suddenly saw the gangsters arrive. They sounded gongs to gather the crowd and prepared to resist the bandits. The water police patrol boat stationed in the town also prepared after hearing the alarm, but fearing that they would be outnumbered, they sent a messenger to report to the police brigade headquarters stationed in Wangting, and the third platoon of the first company sent police to assist. Seeing that the villagers were prepared, the bandit leader blew a whistle as a signal, assembled the team, robbed an empty boat from villager Pu A’da, and sped away. After receiving the report and arriving in town, the third platoon conducted a thorough search in the town, arrested a suspect named Wang Shouqing, and found a pistol and twelve bullets left behind by the gangsters in a nearby grave. They immediately took them back to the city yesterday and sent them to the first company to be interrogated by the brigade headquarters.</p>
<p>Successive Raids on Opium Dens: It is well known that there are many opium dens and opium smokers in the county. Although the county authorities have strictly prohibited them, the largest opium dens and well-known smokers are rarely caught. As a result, the area is filled with opium smoke. Ma A’quan, a resident of No. 32 Luhua Alley outside the North Gate, is a large opium den in the northern part of the city. During the tenure of former County Magistrate Sun Zuji, he was ordered by the province to arrest Ma A’quan and his wife and impose penalties. Unexpectedly, after Ma A’quan served his term, he reorganized and resumed his old business. The other night, Peng Xiwang, the chief of the fifth branch of the public security bureau in charge, learned of this and sent police to search Ma's house, seizing a jar of opium paste and a bag of opium ash from Ma Zifu's body. Ma A’quan and Ma Fubao were taken to the bureau, briefly interrogated, and then sent to the county public security bureau on the 14th, and then transferred to the county court for interrogation. In addition, County Magistrate Chen Chuande recently received a letter from Zou Sen reporting that there are two well-known opium dens on Guanqian Street in the city, which are very prosperous. He requested that police be dispatched to search them as soon as possible. County Magistrate Chen ordered Police Chief Wu Zhengrong to lead the police to search them. First, in Tang Zhu’s den (Tang Lao San) in the small teahouse at No. 5 Guanqian Street, they arrested ten opium offenders including Tang Zhuangkui (Tang Zhuping), and seized a large number of exhibits. Then, they raided an opium den east of the library and arrested fifteen opium offenders including Hua Yin and Fang A’shou. They were all sent to the county and, after interrogation by Wang Kaiwei, chief of the second section, a document was prepared to transfer them to the county court. Yesterday morning, after a preliminary hearing by Chief Justice Zhou, he ordered them all to be detained to await sentencing according to law.</p>
<p>Water Patrol Team Captures Thieves: Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the county water patrol team, recently brought plainclothes police officers to patrol the countryside due to the increasing number of robberies in the surrounding villages. At dawn the other day, near Dongting, they saw four people, each carrying a bundle, acting suspiciously. They immediately pursued and captured three of them. After interrogation, they confessed that one was Wang Heshang, from Wujin, one was Du Ronghe, and one was Lu Baolin, both from Jiangyin. They all confessed to breaking into the Hua family's house in Dongting and stealing because they had no money. They then confessed that there were still stolen goods in the mulberry field. Police officers were dispatched to search the address and found many items of clothing and mosquito nets. They have been sent to the brigade headquarters and then transferred to the county court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Progress on the Construction of the Ring Road around Taihu Lake: The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces previously planned to build a ring road around Taihu Lake through various counties. The Jiangsu Construction Department had already sent personnel to complete the survey, and the lakeside counties had made concrete plans. However, progress had been delayed due to the lack of confirmed funding. Recently, the Construction Department decided to actively raise funds to complete the project as soon as possible, and ordered Ye Jiajun, director of the provincial highway bureau, and the engineering department to take charge of the matter. Director Ye, upon receiving the order, deemed it necessary to investigate previous files in order to prepare the project budget. Yesterday, he sent letters to the construction bureaus of Wuxi, Wujin, and Yixing counties, requesting them to send the previous files on the ring road around Taihu Lake to the bureau to facilitate overall planning and promote progress.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>District Chief Xie Leads Team to Capture Thieves: The house of Zhang Maobao, a resident of Dongji Township, the third district of Wuyi County, was robbed previously. One thief, Zhou Lianzi, had been captured. Another thief, Pan Lao San, was carrying the stolen goods the other day because the local crackdown was very strict. He took a boat from Xiaohe Town to Benniu, intending to take a bus to Shanghai to take temporary shelter. Xie Jun, the district chief of Xixiasu, the third district, was informed and immediately led the security team to wait at the ferry terminal. When the boat arrived, they went forward to search and captured Pan Lao San and many stolen goods. After a preliminary hearing in the district, he confessed to robbing Zhang Maobao's house. District Chief Xie sent the suspect to the city on the 13th to be interrogated by the Clean-Up Bureau.</p>
<p>Poisons Sent to the Procuratorate for Examination: A large amount of poisons such as morphine essence was found at Benniu Station in Wuyi County. Party and government agencies have requested the delivery of the goods and the detention of the people. On the morning of the 13th, Yang Kongxi, the chief prosecutor of the county court, and Li Zonggang, the chief of the public security bureau, went to Benniu by car. At that time, there were many disputes over the circumstances of the discovery of the poisons. Pan Yushu, the station chief, requested instructions from the Shanghai Police General Division. The prosecutor then took the goods to the procuratorate for investigation. County Magistrate Zhang Pengzhu also sent a telegram to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval.</p>

<p>A Murder Case in Zangxiang Village: Tan Wangshi's son Jiaxing from Zangxiang Village in the western countryside was betrothed to Zhou Zhangshi's daughter Maomao from Zhouxiang Village since childhood. Because Jiaxing was young and studying outside, they were not yet married. His mother, Wangshi, suddenly contracted a serious illness and passed away this year, so he married Zhou and brought her into the family to take charge of household affairs. She was diligent and thrifty and was praised by her neighbors. Unexpectedly, Zhou committed suicide by hanging herself yesterday. After receiving the report, the county government sent a special investigator to investigate. According to her husband, Tan Jiaxing, Zhou led the cow back to her mother's house in Zhouxiang the day before to grind rice. She was careless on the way and the cow fell into the dung pit, causing her to be reprimanded by her mother, and she hanged herself out of shame and anger. Her mother accused the clan chief Tan Changming and others of bullying her and causing her daughter to commit suicide out of shame and anger. County Magistrate Wang believed that the case was serious and is under investigation.</p>

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Various Businesses Request the Dismissal of the Stamp Duty Bureau Chief: Chen Jun, the chief of the Jiaxing Stamp Duty Bureau, is young and lazy and does not often go to the bureau. The bureau affairs are handled by a certain clerk in the bureau, and the investigators are also recklessly harassing the people. Occasionally, when they discover underpaid or unpaid stamp duty, they impose severe fines. Merchants and residents are full of complaints. The various businesses have now jointly requested the county Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the provincial bureau to immediately dismiss the bureau chief from his duties in order to maintain official integrity.</p>
<p>Please Remove the Fishing Company's Dam: The Xinji and Yutai fishing companies in the Shuangqiao area of Jiaxing have built dams in the nearby waterways, which are extremely strong. Not only do they hinder water conservancy, but they are also greatly related to farmland. During the recent flood, the farmers in the area requested that the dams be removed to release the water flow. The county government ordered Gao Derun, the chief of the county public security bureau, to supervise the removal of the upper dams of the two fishing companies. Unexpectedly, the farmers in the area again requested the county government to order the complete removal. County Magistrate Gong and Construction Bureau Chief Liang personally went to the countryside to conduct on-site inspections and confirmed that they did indeed hinder water conservancy. The dam built by Xinji was particularly strong and needed to be completely removed. Therefore, they requested the Construction Department to approve the request, and will order the complete removal after approval.</p>
<p>Please Prohibit the Leakage of Rice and Stone to the Sea: In Jiaxing, the price of rice has risen by more than two yuan in the last ten days, and there is a trend of continued increases. The Rice Industry Association and the Rice Price Review Council have requested the county government to forward a request to the provincial department to investigate and prohibit the leakage of rice from Pinghu, Xiashi, and Haining to the sea.

<p>A Major Bribery Case Cracked in Hangzhou: Zhang Jiaxian's mother, a resident of Changgang Town in the eastern countryside of Xiaoshan, was kidnapped by bandits last year and a letter was sent demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Later, the family tried their best to raise 19,500 yuan and entrusted Shen Baosheng, a fellow villager, to go to Shanghai to negotiate. Shen took advantage of this opportunity to profit from it, resulting in insufficient funds, and the victim was torn up by the bandits and her body was dumped in the river. Upon hearing the news, Zhang was extremely grief-stricken and reported to the County Clean-Up Bureau. One of the kidnappers, Qian Asong, was arrested, who confessed that Feng Binggang, a former detective team member, had received a bribe of 300 yuan, and Shen Baosheng had received 200 yuan, and they had now fled to the province. The provincial Clean-Up Bureau ordered the strict arrest. Shen Baosheng was arrested by the Provincial Public Security Bureau the other day.

However, after the start of summer, there has been excessive continuous rain, and many embankments along the Yangtze River and Huai River have collapsed. Although low-lying fields have been flooded, higher-lying fields and hilly fields have not been flooded and can be expected to yield a bumper harvest. Yesterday, a joint general order was issued to sixty counties that the county magistrate should personally conduct a thorough survey of all cases of disaster reporting and insurance claims, and submit detailed reports.</p>
<p>Guangfeng Embankment Collapses, Emergency Relief to Be Issued: The Guangfeng embankment in Badu Lake, Dongliu, fifteen li across the river from Anqing, has approximately 100,000 mu of farmland and a population of approximately tens of thousands.

Officials and gentry have tried their best to rescue it for many days. At 4 p.m. on the 10th, the embankment near Mashiqiao collapsed due to strong winds and waves, killing more than 400 embankment workers who fell into the water. The residents fled to Badushan and set fire to their houses to provide light. After receiving the report, the Department of Civil Affairs forwarded it to the provincial government to allocate emergency relief, dispatch teams to maintain order, and telegraph Yang Yingzhi, the magistrate of Dongliu County, to quickly comfort the victims and strictly prevent rioters from inciting trouble.</p>

<h3>Flood Disaster</h3>
<h3>Relief Committee</h3>
<p>National Government Promulgates</p>
<p>Responsible for Preparing Relief</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that yesterday, the National Government promulgated the establishment of the National Government Flood Relief Committee to handle the relief efforts for the unprecedented flood in the Yangtze River basin and other areas. The government is deeply aware of the breadth and severity of this disaster, which is unprecedented in China in the past century. Therefore, it is making every effort to grant the committee the highest authority to cooperate with various relief agencies in the country in order to achieve the goal of providing relief to tens of millions of disaster victims.</p>
<p>Special Commissioners: The government has recently appointed Song Ziwen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Liu Shangqing, Minister of Interior, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry, Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee, and Zhu Qinglan, who is responsible for relief efforts in the Northwest, as members of the committee, and Song, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan, as the chairman. In the coming days, more enthusiastic people from China and abroad will be selected as members.</p>
<p>The Headquarters is Located in Shanghai: The headquarters is temporarily located next to the Central Bank at No. 1 Jiujiang Road in Shanghai. Zeng Rongpu has been appointed as the secretary-general of the committee. The Chinese telegraph code for the committee is 2182, and the English code is Floodrel.</p>
<p>Cooperate Together: According to the person in charge of the committee, this committee is not limited to government personnel, and it is planned to invite charitable people from all walks of life across the country to cooperate together. There are many Chinese and foreign organizations and individuals who have expressed their willingness to join and assist, and the government is very grateful. The committee also attaches great importance to private relief organizations, and does not want the establishment of this committee by the government to cause the progress of various relief efforts to be slackened. A special department will be set up in the committee to facilitate contact with various charitable organizations and carry out relief efforts.</p>
<p>Assist in Investigation: According to reports from various places, it is sufficient to prove that the disaster is serious, but the detailed situation is still difficult to understand. Therefore, the committee plans to conduct a detailed investigation immediately, with river engineering experts and engineers flying to the disaster area by plane to conduct measurements, and requesting customs, postal, and telegraph agencies to report accurately at any time. In addition to the investigation reports from local authorities in the disaster-stricken provinces and regions, the committee has also entrusted Chinese and foreign private organizations, such as the Bank of China, the Flour Association, Standard Oil, British American Tobacco, and churches in various places, to assist in investigating the conditions in the disaster area in order to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Organization of the Committee: Although the committee was established yesterday, the related personnel have already made plans for the organization. The committee will set up seven sections: the Investigation Section, the Finance Section, the Accounting and Auditing Section, the Health and Epidemic Prevention Section, the Transportation Section, the Disaster Area Work Section, and the Liaison Section. Baker, an advisor to the Ministry of Railways, has handled disaster relief in North China many times and has now been transferred by the committee.</p>
<p>Disaster Area Work: A continuous plan will be implemented within a few months. Due to the massive scale of this flood, with the crops of tens of millions of farmers submerged and agricultural implements washed away, relief should be provided. Until the end of spring next year, after the water recedes, it is planned to have farmers replant vegetables and winter wheat that can be harvested in winter. The committee also plans to use work as relief, allowing disaster victims to engage in repairing embankments, cleaning up disaster areas, building roads, etc. A large number of experienced engineering personnel have been recruited from various parties for this purpose.</p>
<p>This flood has caused great harm. The government knows that it is not like the partial disasters in previous years in various provinces, which could be handled simply by distributing a small amount of money and by local and private relief organizations. The Yangtze River basin is the area of China's wealth, and for the sake of protecting the foundation of the country, the government's relief plan will not only provide food and clothing for the disaster victims in various places, but will also enable the areas to restore their local production capacity.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting's Remarks</h3>
<p>Japanese Sailors Arresting People in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Handled by the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Three Protests Regarding the Korean Issue Yet to Be Issued</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing at 10:40 last night. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed him on the train. According to Foreign Minister Wang, he only saw reports about the incident of Japanese sailors assaulting and arresting anti-Japanese association inspectors in the Huangpu River in the newspapers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a formal report. The matter is currently being handled by the municipal government with the Japanese side. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will handle it after receiving a detailed report from the municipal government. As for the Japanese side's second response to the Korean issue, it cannot be released until both parties agree. Our country's third protest is still under consideration and is expected to be sent out in the near future. In addition, the credentials of Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin need to be signed by Chairman Jiang, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent them to Jiangxi by airmail for Chairman Jiang to sign. It is expected to arrive soon. Ambassador Jiang will go to Japan after receiving his credentials. The credentials of the Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu will be presented after Chairman Jiang returns to Nanjing. At present, all negotiations can still proceed as usual, as this is international practice. It does not matter if the credentials are delivered half a year later.</p>
<p>Japanese Sailors Abducting People and Robbing Goods</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Lodged a Protest Yesterday</h3>
<p>Strong Statements from the Party Headquarters and Labor Unions</p>
<p>On the evening of the 12th of this month, anti-Japanese association inspectors were beaten by Japanese sailors for detaining Japanese goods and were imprisoned in the Japanese Consulate General. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau sent personnel to negotiate their release, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Mayor Zhang believes that the Japanese Navy's actions of assault and robbery violate international law and disregard our country's sovereignty. Yesterday, he lodged the most serious protest with the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Kuramatsu Murai. At the same time, party headquarters in various districts, labor unions, and the municipal federation have all made very strong statements. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Letter to the Japanese Consul: I am writing to you regarding the report that on the evening of the 12th of this month, four Chinese people were abducted by armed Japanese soldiers on the Huangpu River in this city. They were violently beaten and injured and then imprisoned in your consulate. The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to negotiate their release. The fact that Japanese naval soldiers abducted Chinese people within Chinese territory and that your consulate detained these people is a disregard for our country's sovereignty and a violation of international law. The incident occurred because these people were holding a mass movement. All their measures should only be subject to Chinese law. Even if there are any careless actions, it is certainly not for your country's authorities to directly interfere. If such illegal actions were to incite an incident, who would be responsible? Based on the aforementioned, I, the mayor, lodge the most serious protest and request that you investigate and severely punish the soldiers who caused the incident, compensate the injured Chinese people, guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, and express your apology to maintain good relations and avoid disputes. I hope to receive a reply.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Third District Party Headquarters: (Titles omitted) The report that Japanese soldiers forcibly seized sacks and detained and beat inspectors of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association in our country is shocking. Japan, with its small island nation, suffers from overpopulation and actively seeks external development. Our Chinese nation is its only target. The tragedies of "May Fourth," "May Ninth," "May Thirtieth," and "May Third" clearly demonstrate this. The entire national humiliation history of the Chinese nation was created by Japanese imperialism. This time, due to the Wanbaoshan Incident, they incited Korean people to massacre overseas Chinese, resulting in numerous deaths and inhumane atrocities. All circles in this city, saddened by the impending national crisis and the approaching doomsday, strive for survival and dare not slacken. Hence, the organization of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee was formed to carry out economic severance with Japan in a determined and courageous spirit. This has aroused suspicion from Japanese imperialism, which has spared no despicable means to sabotage it in every possible way. They even forcibly seized confiscated inferior goods and arrested anti-Japanese personnel in our country, subjecting them to various forms of violence, even to the point of disappearance. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? However, it is found that the occurrence of such unfortunate events is due to cold-blooded merchants who covet petty profits and do not hesitate to use the force of Japanese soldiers to protect them. Therefore, this association dares to contribute its views: (1) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be urged to negotiate with Japan as soon as possible to achieve the goals of punishing the perpetrators, apologizing, compensating, guaranteeing, and withdrawing Japanese warships stationed in China. (2) The Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association should offer rewards and publish announcements to expose merchants who purchase sacks from the Dongya Factory and transport large quantities of Japanese goods. Once verified, they will be severely punished with the force of the masses to deter traitors. In addition to petitioning superiors to implement the aforementioned proposals, this association will lead its members to expand publicity and urge the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association to continue its struggle. It is hoped that all compatriots will unanimously advocate that the entire Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese movement will not be ruined by a few merchants or succumb to the violence of Japanese imperialism. This is deeply fortunate. Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special City Third District Executive Committee. In addition, the Ninth and Thirtieth Sub-branches of the Third District and the Third Sub-branch of the Eighth District have all issued declarations, the text of which is omitted.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Eighth District Party Headquarters: The Eighth District Party Headquarters telegrams to all newspapers in Shanghai for the attention of all compatriots: Unfortunately, our country is suffering from repeated foreign invasions. Japanese imperialists are extremely fierce and regard our country as meat on the chopping board and treat the Eastern Provinces as colonies to be nibbled away. Their ambition is growing daily. They destroyed our good men and slaughtered our farmers in the Wanbaoshan area and incited hooligans in Korea to attack and beat people at will. All areas where our overseas Chinese merchants live and work have been destroyed. Within ten days, thousands of people have died, and the number of injured is countless, creating a terrifying situation. However, Japanese imperialists have no intention of repenting. Recently, Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai have repeatedly sent armed sailors to invade the Chinese territory, robbing goods, arresting compatriots, and brutally beating officials of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association. Their sinister intentions are evident. If we do not take immediate action to deal with this trampling of our nation and disregard for our country's rights, what can we expect for the future? It is hoped that our countrymen will rise up and pursue the matter directly, insist on reason and strive for it, and fight Japanese imperialism to the end to wipe out this great shame, strive for the survival of the nation, and strive for the survival of the country. We send this urgent telegram with extreme excitement and indignation. Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special City Eighth District Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Ninth District Party Headquarters: The boycott of Japanese goods is purely a manifestation of the patriotic psychology of our people. Confiscating inferior goods is a necessary means to implement economic severance. No one can prevent it. However, Japanese imperialists did not immediately wake up and stop their policy of aggression against China. Instead, in Shanghai, a major transportation hub, when our patriotic action confiscated Japanese goods, they used force to rob goods, kidnapped four inspectors, and brutally beat them, leaving them covered in blood. The shocking news has been spread, and we cannot help but be furious. Thinking back, the old shame of May 30th has not yet been avenged, and the Wanbaoshan incident has occurred again. Now, the brutal and tyrannical Japanese imperialists want to repeat the tragedy in Shanghai and spill blood on Nanjing Road. It must be known that the people under the banner of the Three People's Principles revolution have a spirit of great fearlessness and will never be subdued by force. They are not afraid of the trampling of iron hooves or the sweeping of bullets. They would rather build a city with white bones to protect our beautiful rivers and mountains and sprinkle blood on the ground to seek the freedom of our nation. In addition to sending a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association to step up its work, this association is willing to have all comrades and compatriots in the country follow the precepts of the rise and fall of the world and the responsibility of every citizen, rise up together, boycott Japanese goods, make persistent efforts, and carry it through to the end.</p>
<p>Declarations of Various Labor Unions: Shanghai Municipal Labor Unions solemnly declare against the barbarous acts of Japanese soldiers abducting and robbing. Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Party Headquarters at all levels, governments of all provinces, cities, and counties, labor unions, mass organizations, newspapers, all attention: Since the Japanese used the Wanbaoshan incident to incite Korean people to massacre overseas Chinese, their insidious intentions and outrageous atrocities have been exposed to the world. All those with blood and qi cannot but be angry. Our government, in the midst of the Japanese's increasingly aggressive atrocities, is willing to endure humiliation and still believes that the Japanese can be reasoned with and that world peace must be maintained. Therefore, on the one hand, it lodges a protest and still treats the Japanese with sincerity and openness in accordance with international etiquette. On the other hand, it publishes the facts to the international nations to clarify the truth and uphold justice. At the same time, it automatically raises funds to provide relief to the overseas Chinese who have suffered, hoping that the Japanese will lay down their butcher knives and take the opportunity to pull back from the brink and achieve a good outcome. The intention of our national government can be said to be perfect. However, the Japanese are still stubborn and unrepentant, perfunctorily and evasively dealing with repeated protests, exhausting their cunning and insidious abilities. Gradually, the overseas Chinese in the areas where the tragedy occurred have nowhere to bury the dead and no way to escape. Disturbances by mobs still occur anytime and anywhere, and crises are everywhere, but the Japanese turn a blind eye. Not only that, but our compatriots, hating the barbarity of the Japanese, unanimously declared economic severance with Japan in a determined and courageous spirit to urge them to repent. Unexpectedly, the Japanese imperialists have no intention of repenting and dare to intensify their actions. On the 11th of this month, the Japanese imperialists repeatedly dispatched Japanese soldiers with guns and live ammunition to the Suzhou Creek and Huangpu River areas in Shanghai to forcibly rob the Japanese goods seized by the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association organized by our people from all walks of life. They also abducted five officials of the association. After four of them were released, they were covered in injuries and treated like prisoners. The whereabouts of one person are unknown. Is their despicable behavior and barbaric methods not a disregard for international law and the civilization of demons and a common enemy of mankind? Our 400 million compatriots, in this time of national crisis, only have one choice: to rise up together and fight them to the last victory. Survival is at stake. We will go through fire and water and will not hesitate. At the same time, we also hope that all sectors of society across the country will work together to organize the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association, adhere to the economic severance with Japan, and control this evil. We will make thorough plans to help the overseas Chinese in distress, without distinguishing between regions or boundaries, with one heart and one mind, from beginning to end. Our associations and others will serve the country and will not hesitate to move forward and attack without falling behind, and we will eventually bury the giant barbarians to maintain our peace, and then we will be satisfied. At this time of crisis, if there are those who flatter foreigners and are greedy, disregard the national difficulties, and have ulterior motives to sabotage the organization of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association, then they are close to treason, and this association will use the same methods to deal with them as it does with imperialists, so that the river will be clear and the anti-Japanese work, the welfare of the overseas Chinese, and the national status can all advance without limits. Words cannot express our intentions, but we hope you will take it to heart. This declaration is made by the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, the Publishing Industry Union, the Water and Electricity Industry Unions in various districts, the Cotton Textile Industry Unions in various districts, the Cigarette Industry Unions in various districts, the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, the Bookbinding Industry Union, the Ship Timber Industry Union, and more than one hundred other labor unions on August 14th.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, Shipbuilding Industry Union, Paper Industry Union, Loading and Unloading Industry Union, Match Industry Union, Bottle Industry Union, Water and Wood Industry Union, Garment Industry Union, Country Wine Production Industry Union, Basket Carrier Industry Union, Coarse Cloth Industry Union, and Civil Ship Repair Industry Union have sent telegrams, the text of which is omitted.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Municipal Federation: The Municipal Federation's telegram regarding the barbarity of the Japanese soldiers is directed to the Nanjing National Government, the Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters: On August 13th at 1:00 AM, the Japanese Naval Office, now stationed on the Anzhai warship in Shanghai, sent 25 armed sailors on a small steamer to invade Lujiazui, the inland area of Shanghai, robbing goods waiting to be checked and released and abducting the cargo inspectors. Except for the four who were released after negotiation, the whereabouts of one person are unknown. After this case occurred, all citizens were shocked and indignant. Everyone felt that the Japanese were behaving in an uncivilized and brutal manner, which was beyond words. It can be inferred that in their eyes, there is no China, so they dare to wield their weapons at night and enter the area where Chinese military police are stationed as if it were no man's land. Robbing goods and abducting people and leaving safely is like taking something out of a pocket. In this situation, it is difficult for the Chinese military police to avoid responsibility for lax defense, but the actions of the Japanese soldiers are no different from those of robbers. Human sentiment and legal principles are not tolerated. How can neighboring friendly nations do this? In this case, the Ministry of the Navy should order the warship to disarm the Anzhai warship and order it to leave the country. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should also lodge a strong protest and severely punish the commanding officers of the Japanese Naval Office, return the one cargo inspector whose whereabouts are unknown by a set deadline, and punish the perpetrators, apologize, compensate, and guarantee that there will be no similar riots in the future. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Municipal Government should also strictly order their subordinate military police to strictly defend and not allow armed foreign bandits to invade the country at will. If foreign bandits invade, they should be disarmed immediately and sent to the ministry for investigation. Only in this way can the country's rights be protected and security and aftermath be maintained. This telegram is sent to you with utmost sincerity. Shanghai Special Zone Citizens' Federation.</p>

<p>The Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications previously ordered 150 million National Revolutionary Party Founder Sun Yat-sen stamps from the British De La Rue Printing Company, with a five-year term, to be printed and delivered to the Administration annually. The first batch of 120 million stamps has been shipped to Shanghai, divided into denominations of 1 fen, 2 fen, 4 fen, and 2 jiao. The 2 jiao stamp is blue, the 4 fen stamp is light green, the 2 fen stamp is green, and the 1 fen stamp is golden yellow. All of them feature a portrait of the National Revolutionary Party Founder Sun Yat-sen and the Blue Sky with a White Sun. The size is the same as that of the old-style stamps. The Postal Administration has now reported to the Ministry of Communications, and it has been decided internally that from September 1st, postal districts in all provinces will implement their use. It has been decided that the old-style stamps will no longer be printed. After they are used up, they will be replaced with the new stamps. There are also seven other types of new stamps engraved with the portraits of Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, Chen Qimei, Deng Keng, etc., which were contracted to the Beiping Ministry of Finance Printing Bureau for printing. They have not yet been printed, so they cannot be used at the same time. As for the four types of new Sun Yat-sen stamps, a way was found to make printing plates and publish them first, so that the general public and stamp collectors can see them first.</p>

<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that the important Communist Party member, the Westerner Noulens, and his wife were escorted to Nanjing by the Garrison Headquarters this morning (the 14th) and will be tried in a military court in Nanjing. The Swiss Consulate General has also confirmed that Noulens is not a Swiss national. It was learned from this port today that after the arrest of the two and the discovery of important documents, dozens of Communist suspects have been arrested in Java, the Indian Ocean colonies, and the Philippines, including many foreigners. Chinese authorities have also received reports that Noulens and his wife held important positions in the Moscow Soviet Committee. Although the authorities are not yet willing to make any announcements regarding this case, it is expected that after studying the case documents, they will know the activities of the Communist Party in Shanghai and will continue to make arrests. It is reported that Noulens' deputy, a Westerner, has secretly left Shanghai and fled elsewhere. When Noulens and his wife were escorted to the train this morning, they were guarded by armed soldiers. After the group got out of the car, Mrs. Noulens walked through the platform with her head down and entered the train without looking around. Her face showed sadness. Her husband looked around from time to time, still with a hint of hope. In the train, the two sat about ten feet apart and spoke in German from time to time.</p>
<h3>Genuine Invoices and Fake Invoices</h3>
<p>Unscrupulous Merchants Falsely Impersonating Japanese Merchants to Transport Goods</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Finds Genuine Evidence</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month, inspectors from the Zhabei District Inspection Office of the Anti-Japanese Association, including Inspector Yin Jianxia, ​​confiscated two carts of various glass bottles on Xibaoxing Road. However, the deliveryman insisted that the glass bottles were sold by the Baocheng Glass Factory to the Japanese merchants Dongjin and Jinxing Foreign Companies and not to Chinese businesses. He also took out two invoices from Dongjin and Jinxing as proof and requested to be released. However, the inspection office had previously received a tip that there were genuine invoices hidden on the deliveryman's body and that the invoices taken out as proof were deliberately faked in the name of Japanese merchants. The inspectors immediately carried out an inspection and finally found a genuine invoice from the Baocheng Glass Factory to the Xie Shang Company on the deliveryman's body, which listed the names and quantities of the goods and was exactly the same as the one falsely made in the name of Dongjin. It was clear that he had deliberately made a fake invoice to deceive the port. The goods were all confiscated and the genuine and fake invoices were sent to the Anti-Japanese Association for thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>The Chilean Embassy Temporarily Establishes an Office</h3>
<p>Located in the Cathay Hotel on the Bund</p>
<p>The newly appointed Chargé d'Affaires of Chile to China, Mr. Blanco Sierra, after arriving in Shanghai, once went to Beijing to pay respects to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting and various important figures of the National Government. After returning to Shanghai, he prepared to establish an office of the embassy in Shanghai. However, in recent times, Mr. Blanco found it quite difficult to find a suitable building. Therefore, for the convenience of office work, he has decided to first establish a temporary office in the Cathay Hotel on the Bund and has hired Feng Tianying, a special Shanghai-based reporter from the French "Political News" in Peiping, as his secretary. Mr. Feng graduated from the University of Lyon in France and previously served as a secretary at the Turkish Embassy. The temporary office has already begun operating, with hours temporarily set from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. However, formal notifications have not yet been sent to various Chinese and foreign agencies and organizations, and it is expected that a notification will be sent after a permanent embassy is found. At that time, negotiations on the new Sino-Chilean treaty will also commence.</p>

<h3>French Concession Tram Restarts Yesterday</h3>
<p>Conflict between Car Department and Mechanical Department, Guaranteed by Du Yuesheng</p>
<p>However, Temporary Short-Term Workers' Demands Unresolved</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Inquired About 8-Hour Workday</p>
<p>Today, the Labor Union Holds a Victory Meeting at Zhuangyuanlou</p>
<p>French Concession power and tram workers officially resumed work yesterday, restoring all routes to their original state. The car department is awaiting a response from the company, and all workers are demanding an eight-hour workday, creating a rather serious situation. Short-term workers are still on strike due to unresolved demands for improved treatment. The labor union is holding a victory celebration today. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Please Du Yuesheng for Guarantee: The Third District Power and Tram Industry Union held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 5 PM the day before yesterday, chaired by Xu Yushu. After receiving a secret report that the car department workers were going to pick a fight with the mechanical department workers, the meeting decided to send representatives Lu Guanhong, Zhang Renjun, Zhang Amao, Zhu Along, Zhang Yinsheng, and Qiao Linggen to Du Yuesheng's private residence at 7 PM to request a guarantee. Du Yuesheng agreed to be responsible for the guarantee, hoping that everyone would work in peace.</p>
<p>All Cars Fully Restored: Starting yesterday, more than 800 employees in the car department, including ticket sellers, drivers, ticket inspectors, and ticket clerks, officially resumed work. Tram routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 60, trolley routes 17 and 18, and bus routes 21 and 22 are all operating as normal. On that day, over 80 trams, over 20 trolley buses, and 18 buses were dispatched. As for the car department's proposed requests for a published apology and punishment of the perpetrators, the company is still considering them. The car department has stated that they are awaiting a response.</p>
<p>Labor-Management Consultation: Over 200 temporary short-term workers at the French Concession Power and Tram Company requested (1) a 30% increase in wages for each person per day, (2) a minimum employment period of eight months, and (3) full pay on Sundays, but these were not granted. As a result, they went on strike on the afternoon of the 12th and sent representatives to ask Chinese Director Du Yuesheng to negotiate with the company manager, Monsalut. The result was that the company only agreed to an increase of five cents per person per day, which was not resolved. Yesterday, they again asked Du Yuesheng to negotiate with the manager. The manager only agreed to (1) continue to increase wages by five cents per person per day and (2) one day off for every six days worked, refusing to agree to anything else. The workers insisted that the minimum employment period be six months, so it remained unresolved. Negotiations will continue today, and it is expected that the issue will be resolved, and the strike will not escalate.</p>
<p>Negotiations on Working Hours: The Second District Electric Workers' Union received a response from the company manager, Monsalut, agreeing to respond before August 18. Yesterday, the union sent another letter to the company, stating: "To Whom It May Concern: After investigating the implementation of the Factory Law by the National Government since August 1, all major factories in Shanghai and the Municipal Council have implemented it. However, your company has delayed implementing the provisions of Article 8 of Chapter 3 of the law, which establishes an eight-hour workday as a principle. We do not know why. After deliberation by the joint meeting of directors and supervisors, we request that your company quickly implement an eight-hour workday to comply with the law and avoid disputes."</p>
<p>Inquiry by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs: After receiving a request from the labor union to implement an eight-hour workday, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs summoned everyone for questioning on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Xu A-mei, the chairman of the Second District Electric Industry Union, and Zhang Zhenyuan, the chairman of the Bureau of Social Affairs, attended. The labor representatives stated (1) that Article 8 of the Factory Law stipulates that the actual working hours for adult workers should be eight hours per day in principle, and (2) that the French Municipal Council has already implemented an eight-hour workday. The chairman announced the end of the questioning and rescheduled to conduct mediation.</p>
<p>Labor Union Victory Celebration: The Second District Power and Tram Industry Union, formerly the French Concession Power and Tram Union, will hold a victory celebration at Zhuangyuanlou in Baxianqiao at 7 PM today to celebrate the reinstatement of Xu A-mei and 27 others who were previously dismissed. All sectors are invited to participate. Chinese Director Du Yuesheng has also agreed to send police to maintain order at that time. It is said that Zhuangyuanlou is already setting up a decorated archway.</p>

<p>French Concession Detectives Investigate</p>
<p>French Concession detectives Tao Desheng, Wang Zhihao, Chen Yishan, and Qi Deqing learned the day before yesterday that someone had privately set up a counterfeit money manufacturing operation at No. 46, Jianye Li, Fulu Li Road in the French Concession.

They arrested nine individuals including Gu Jinsheng, Gu Gengsheng, Wu Jinsheng, Yao Yiqing, Wang Rongsheng, Li Rufei, Zhang Aliu, and women Gu Wangshi and Ye Chenshi, and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Special District Court for investigation. First, police attorney Gu Shouxi stated that the case was broken because Zhang Aliu used a five-dollar counterfeit note to buy a dollar's worth of soap at a store opened by a Westerner named Byro at 655 Avenue Joffre, and Byro noticed it and reported it to the police. The detectives then successively solved the case. It was found that the defendants in this case counterfeited these banknotes in the amount of tens of thousands of dollars and sent people to distribute them. The main culprits are still at large, so please issue warrants to arrest them for interrogation. Judge Xiong questioned each defendant briefly and then ordered them to be detained and rescheduled for further questioning.</p>
<p>"Weisheng" Steamship</p>
<h3>Shipwrecked Crew and Passengers Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The "Weisheng" steamship of Jardine Matheson was wrecked off the coast of Wenzhou due to the severe storm, which has already been reported in this newspaper. The shipwrecked crew and passengers have now arrived in Shanghai on a Guangdong steamship. Further details are reported below:</p>
<p>"Weisheng" Aground on Reef: The "Weisheng" steamship was en route from Hong Kong to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 9th, when it arrived at Nanguan Bay off the coast of Wenzhou, the captain, Mr. Hsu, observed the weather and knew that a strong storm was coming. He steered the ship into the Nanguan Bay Strait to shelter from the storm. That night, two anchors were dropped. There was no damage to the ship. By 8:00 AM on the 10th, the wind had increased, and the ship was driven aground by the storm. The bottom of the ship was punctured. Although cargo on the deck was thrown into the sea, it was still unavoidable. According to the captain of the Guangdong steamship, the "Weisheng" steamship is still aground on the reef, listing to one side, and all cabins have been flooded.</p>
<p>Crew and Passengers Rescued to Shanghai: At the beginning of the "Weisheng" shipwreck, the captain immediately launched lifeboats to transport the passengers ashore for temporary shelter. The first boat launched was smashed on a reef by the wind. At that time, the radio was broken. Fortunately, there was still a spare machine that could send out a distress signal, but it could not reach far. The Tai Koo's Guangdong steamship received the signal, which was about 100 nautical miles from Nanguan Bay, and immediately relayed it to Hong Kong and Shanghai and sailed to rescue them. It was not until the morning of the 11th that it was able to enter the bay and rescued 43 passengers and crew members from the "Weisheng" steamship, carrying them to Shanghai, where they have now arrived.</p>
<p>Rescue Ships and Warships Rush to the Scene: After receiving the telegram, Jardine Matheson first sent the "Hengsheng" steamship, and then telegraphed Japan to send a salvage ship. It should arrive in Hong Kong today. The British Navy also dispatched the destroyer HMS Spey to protect them. The "Hengsheng" steamship is currently guarding outside the "Weisheng." Yesterday, the Hong Kong-based "Hesheng" and "Dangsheng" steamships were dispatched to the shipwreck site to assist in the rescue.</p>
<p>Captain Remains Ashore: When the "Weisheng" cabins were flooded and the crew and passengers were rescued, they were robbed once by pirates, and the property loss was huge. The captain and chief mate, because they could not stay on the ship, set up tents on the beach and moved ashore. All food was supplied by the "Guangdong" and "Hengsheng" steamships, and they were provided with self-defense weapons, waiting for the salvage ship sent by the company to decide on a plan before coming to Shanghai. Most of the cargo on the ship has been flooded, resulting in huge losses.</p>
<p>Accommodation for the Shipwrecked Personnel: The person who fell into the sea and died was confirmed to be an assistant to the comprador. At that time, the third mate launched a lifeboat to rescue the assistant, but the lifeboat was destroyed by the waves, and the third mate, Xue Mingdeng, drowned. His body has not been found yet. All others are safe. The passengers who were rescued to Shanghai have all returned home. The crew and sailors have also been settled by the company, and the sailors have reported the losses to the union and requested compensation.</p>
<h3>Boatman Rescued After an Ordeal</h3>
<p>Minli Ferry Shipwrecked in Storm</p>
<p>All Eight Boatmen Fell into the Water</p>
<p>Six Drowned, Two Rescued</p>
<p>Adrift at Sea for Four Days and Nights</p>
<p>The Minli ferry from Fuzhou, with eight crew members, was carrying cargo on the 8th of this month when it encountered a hurricane while sailing in the Beijia waters of Fujian. The storm capsized the boat, and all eight men fell into the water. Six of them were immediately swept away by the huge waves and tragically drowned. Two crew members, Wang Xiansong and Chen Guining, were fortunate enough to grab hold of the guardrail of the boat and held on, avoiding being submerged. However, they were adrift in the vast sea, with no way to call for help. They drifted with the wind and waves for four days and nights. They were exhausted and hoarse, with no strength to hold on. At that critical moment, a British ship (Katie Moller) sailing from Borneo to China came across them and rescued them. The two crew members were injured and mentally exhausted. The ship sailed into the Wusong mouth yesterday morning, and when the foreign affairs section of the municipal public security bureau went to check their passports, the ship's captain handed over the two rescued crew members. The foreign affairs section staff thanked the ship's captain for his kindness in rescuing them, and after completing the inspection, they took the two crew members Wang and Chen back to Wusong and sent them to the Seashore Public Hospital for treatment. Wang Xiansong suffered minor injuries and was discharged from the hospital. The water patrol team sent him to the relief section of the municipal public security bureau to arrange accommodation. Chen Guining was more seriously injured and remained in the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Nisshinya Bank</p>
<h3>Second Refund of Deposits</h3>
<p>Since the collapse of Nisshinya Bank, the various deposits and savings in the Grand World Savings Department have been liquidated by accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng. Starting from June 18, Shanghai Bank's Baxianqiao branch was entrusted to issue 10% of the deposits, and various creditors of the company have successively claimed them. Accountants Lu Pan and Wu believe that the branch paid quickly and all creditors were satisfied, so they have requested the branch to act as agent for the second time, planning to pay out another 10% of the debts starting today. All creditors of the company can follow the notification procedures of the liquidators and go to the original temporary office of Shanghai Bank's Baxianqiao branch at Minthineim Road in the French Concession to exchange their savings passbooks for payment vouchers at the accountant's office and then go to the new address of the branch to receive payment.</p>
<h3>Gospel for Passengers at South Shanghai Wharf</h3>
<p>Convenient Boarding and Alighting...Petty Thieves Vanish</p>
<p>Since the South Shanghai Steamboat Wharf was taken over and managed by the Public Works Bureau, it has applied to the municipal government for funds to dredge the mud, repair the embankments, and floating docks. The dredging project has recently reached outside Pier 6, and the embankment project also started construction yesterday. The repaired floating docks 1 to 4 were reinstalled successively the day before yesterday. All rotten hatch bridges and steel parts were replaced with new ones. In the future, the berthing of ships and the boarding and alighting of passengers will be more convenient and safer. It is also reported that the wharf management office of the Public Works Bureau and the wharf station of the Public Security Bureau are extremely strict in investigating bandits. At 4 PM yesterday, a bandit named Miao pretended to be a steamboat attendant and tricked a passenger named Shi out of a suitcase (containing gold ornaments worth about 500-600 dollars), intending to escape. He was immediately caught by the wharf police with the stolen goods and sent to the First District General Administration and then to the Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>

<p>Wu Biao Assassination Case</p>
<h3>Two Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>The Corpse Was Examined Yesterday</p>
<p>Wu Biao, also known as Wu Baoqing, 34 years old, lived at No. 854 Zuzu Li, Binlang Road. At 8:50 PM the night before last, he was talking with his friends Yu Deyang and Yu Baoquan in his bedroom when a thug with a gun reached out the window and fired, hitting Wu's vital point and killing him. This has already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. The body was transported to the Felun Road Corpse Examination Office. Meanwhile, the Gordon Road Police arrested two suspects, Yu. Yesterday morning, Special Court Inspector Guo Wei visited the office to examine the body. According to Yu Baoquan and Yu Deyang, Yu and Wu were always good friends, and they did not know anything about Wu's shooting. They went to Wu's place that day to discuss something. According to Wu's wife, Wu Wangshi, she was also in the room at the time. After her husband was murdered, he was still able to run to the back hall, and she held him, covered in blood. He only said that he was shot and then fell to the ground and died. Her husband served as deputy captain in the Jiangyin Public Security Bureau from August to December last year and captured two communist bandits. He executed them by firing squad in January of this year. One of the bandits was named Zhu Awu, and he had two brothers, Da Asan and Xiao Asan, who had said that they wanted to murder her husband. After hearing this, Inspector Guo said that the examiner had confirmed that the deceased, Wu Biao, also known as Wu Baoqing, had indeed died from a gunshot wound. The suspects Yu Baoquan and Yu Deyang have been sued by the police station and should be subject to court review. The escaped murderer is being investigated by the police, and the gun is temporarily handed over to the police for safekeeping. The body is handed over to the wife, Wu Wangshi, who will sign and take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Two Trams Collide and Injure People</h3>
<p>At around 7 AM yesterday morning, two trams collided on the Bund Baidu Bridge along the Suzhou River. A tram on Route 8 from Yangshupu was coming from Shiliupu. As it was coming off the bridge and turning east, a tram on Route 1 from Jingan Temple Road was winding its way up the Suzhou River and wanted to turn south onto the bridge. However, the driver of Route 8 did not ring the bell, and the driver of Route 1 was in a hurry to drive, and did not pay attention. Suddenly there was a loud noise, and the two cars crashed violently. Sparks flew everywhere. The engine box of the Route 8 tram exploded on the spot, and the front of the car was damaged, and many glass windows were broken. Due to the severe shock, the Route 8 tram derailed. The Route 1 car was also slightly damaged, but was still able to drive. At that time, the passengers in both cars were panicked and scrambled to get off the car, and the order was disrupted. Two male and female passengers were injured and sent to the hospital for treatment. A man had a broken skin on his head, but there was no major problem, while a woman had a chest injury, which was more serious. The derailed Route 8 tram was subsequently ordered by the company to send workers to put it back on the track, but traffic was blocked as a result, and it took more than an hour to restore it.</p>

<h3>Even Stove Owners are Scared of Extortion</h3>
<p>Using a Fruit Basket and "White Golden Dragon" Cigarettes as a Signal</p>
<p>Sure Enough, Someone Contacted [the victim] Near Bubbling Well Road</p>
<p>Lu Ganlang, a native of Haimen, runs a stove shop and rents out rickshaws at 35 Xinji Road. His business is doing well, and he has accumulated some savings, which has attracted the attention of criminals. Between the 3rd and 13th of this month, he suddenly received three threatening letters from a criminal gang, demanding 3,000 yuan. The letters instructed him to book a room at the Wugong Hotel on Fuzhou Road at noon on the 12th, with the surname "Zhou" written on the water sign, and someone would contact him. Lu reported the situation to the Huishan Police Station, which in turn informed the Inspector-General's Office to make an arrest. Detective Sergeant Tang Jian, Detective Liu Shaokui, and Detective Feng Zhiming were dispatched to keep watch, but found nothing. At 9:00 PM, they suddenly received a phone call from the criminals, instructing that the next morning, near the Saposai Road [now Xinzha Road] on Bubbling Well Road in the French Concession, the person should carry a fruit basket and two tins of "White Golden Dragon" cigarettes as a mark. The detectives agreed. The next morning, Detective Feng disguised himself as Lu's representative and followed the instructions. At 11:00 AM, they saw Huang A'mei from Pudong coming forward and asking Feng if he was sent by the Lu family from Zhoujiazui Road. When Feng replied yes, Huang snatched the fruit basket from Feng and was immediately apprehended by Chinese and Western detectives. Upon further interrogation, it was learned that Zhang Zhenya and Zhang Gensong from Pudong were the ones who wrote the threatening letters. The detectives then went to No. 188 Ximen Road and apprehended both Zhangs, taking them back to the Huishan Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case, stating that all three defendants had confessed at the police station and requested prosecution. The threatening letters were presented as evidence. Huang A'mei confessed that he was fooled by a friend named Jiang to go there and pick up the fruit and cigarettes, and had not conspired beforehand. The two Zhangs also confessed that Jiang was the one who came up with the idea, saying that Lu was quite wealthy, so they sent a letter asking for a loan of 3,000 yuan. Judge Xiao Xie fen reviewed the confessions and ordered the three defendants to be detained pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Wooden Cage Placed at Xinzha Bridge</h3>
<p>To Warn Unscrupulous Merchants</p>
<p>Yesterday, a wooden cage was placed at the Xinzha Bridge in Zhabei by the Anti-Japanese Association. The cage resembled a sentry box that policemen used to stand in during rainy weather, except that it had no wooden boards around it, and only a few thin boards on top. The patrol officers of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, believing that the wooden cage was placed in a public place with many pedestrians and might be unsightly, moved it to the entrance of the Public Security Bureau. It is said that it will still need to be sent back to its original location, so that a group of unscrupulous merchants who sell Japanese goods will be warned when they see it.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<h3>Order to Western Restaurant Industry to Resume Work Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Employer's Absence Led to Failed Mediation</p>
<p>Daily Losses Exceeding 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Workers in the city's Western restaurant industry went on strike due to wage and condition issues. The Social Affairs Bureau conducted mediation yesterday, but it failed due to the absence of the employers. It is said that the strike has caused the employers to lose more than 5,000 yuan per day. The union has issued a declaration. The following details are provided regarding tomorrow's situation:</p>
<p>Authorities Mediate: In order to quickly resolve the wage and condition issues in the Western restaurant industry, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to conduct mediation. Union representatives Yao Zhongqing and Wu Shenxiang, Municipal Party Department representative Lu Yin Chu, and Social Affairs Bureau representative Zhang Shuye were present. However, due to the absence of the employer representatives, mediation could not proceed. They had no choice but to ask the labor representatives to return and await legal action. The Western Restaurant Industry Association stated in a letter to the bureau yesterday that they were unable to attend due to time constraints. Last night, the bureau ordered all workers to resume work today and ordered the employer's association to instruct all restaurants not to deliberately make things difficult for the workers when they resume work.</p>
<p>Strike Losses: Western restaurants such as Quanjiafu, Pacific, Royal Palace, Xinlicha, Zuihechun, Yizhixiang, Daguanlou, Hengsheng, Yijia Chun, and Jinlong have been affected by the workers' strike since the afternoon of the 12th. Although they have hired non-union members to work, each restaurant has suffered business losses of more than 5,000 yuan per day. However, the intangible losses of the workers are not included.</p>
<p>District Assistance: Yesterday, the pharmaceutical industry union, the publishing industry union, the medicine industry union, the hotel reception union, the ink making union, the umbrella industry union, the soy sauce industry union, and other unions sent representatives to the Western restaurant industry union to express their condolences, indicating their united support and willingness to act as a backing.</p>
<p>Declaration Issued: All members of the Municipal Western Restaurant Industry Union, being oppressed by the employers and not receiving a sincere response to the proposed terms, have automatically declared a strike. Fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, and comrades from all walks of life, our Western Restaurant Industry Union has been under the oppression of employers for more than ten years. The cost of living is increasing day by day. Our poor workers are not only unable to improve their lives, but their treatment cannot be improved either. These tiger-wolf-like managers are instead exploiting the union's rightful benefits, layer upon layer, and reporting less than the actual amount of our hard-earned small accounts. Wives, concubines, rickshaw drivers, and servants all have to extract from these small accounts. Since 1927, the employer's illegally organized trade association has also extracted its funds from these small accounts, accumulating to as much as seven or eight thousand yuan. These managers also arbitrarily deprive us of the extra money we earn. Continuously dismissing workers and undermining our labor movement is their only trick. This time, in order to demand improved conditions, union representatives have negotiated four times, but there has been no response. They intentionally delay, trying to scatter the hearts of our workers. We ask, how can such vicious methods be tolerated? Therefore, all of our workers, due to the time constraints of the Western restaurant industry, are in a situation of urgency and must promptly demand the establishment of terms. If we are delayed for another year or half a year, our workers will inevitably be dismissed one by one. For this reason, all of our workers, without waiting for the union to mediate, have automatically and painfully risen up since the 12th, and unanimously gone on strike. In this harsh environment, we vow to fight to the end and will not retreat until we have achieved our desired improvements. We ask all sectors to come out and uphold justice for us. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Urgently Demands Overdue Grain Tax</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Summons to the Clerks for a Conversation</p>
<p>Since Wang Huaxing took office as the Director of the Shanghai County Finance Bureau, he has found that the overdue grain tax from the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th years of the Republic is very large. At a time when provincial and local treasuries are empty, it is necessary to strictly urge for the completion of payment. Therefore, in addition to issuing announcements to all households owing grain tax, urging them to pay as soon as possible, Director Wang also summoned the tax collection clerks from each district to the bureau yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Director Wang addressed them, stating that grain tax is the state's due, and should not be overdue. He ordered the clerks to collect at least 80% of the outstanding grain tax under their names within twenty days, and the remaining 20% must be completely cleared within another ten days. The Director will assess their performance to determine whether they stay or leave, and they must not continue to delay, or they will be punished. The clerks all agreed and left.</p>
<p>Municipal Federation Requests</p>
<h3>Correction of the Name of Roads Built Beyond the Border Approved</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department Executive Committee received a petition from the Shanghai Special District Citizens Federation the other day, stating that the names of the roads built beyond the border by the Public Concession should be rectified to uphold national sovereignty and follow public opinion. It was learned that the petition was approved at the 125th standing committee meeting of the Party Committee, and a special letter was sent to the Municipal Government for the record, requesting immediate notification. This approval, etc.</p>
<h3>Further News on the Election Dispute of the Women's Relief Association</h3>
<p>Huang Daping and Four Committee Members Express Resignation</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the election dispute that occurred the other day at the Shanghai Women's Relief Association regarding the election issue, and the names of the elected persons were announced yesterday, the storm seemed to have gradually subsided. However, according to Tang Naixin, Huang Daping, Zhang Xuefei, and Bao Guangyu, four preparatory committee members, the election dispute was superficially about the district representative issue, but the reality was not so. We were ordered to prepare, sacrificing more than two months of time and energy, hoping that all comrades would cooperate sincerely for the welfare of women in the city, but unexpected events occurred. There was one or two individuals who acted independently and disregarded the overall situation. Therefore, although the election has been held, it is better to consider it illegal based on the facts. The reasons are listed below: (1) Changing the agenda of the inaugural meeting; (2) Only representatives from three districts participated in the election; (3) Without the consent of the seven preparatory committee members, one or two individuals made detailed arrangements and used swift and decisive means temporarily. Moreover, after the meeting, they privately took away the stamps and documents of the meeting, etc. What is the purpose of this? Women's movement is a cause close to the hearts of women, but this unfortunate situation has occurred. We are truly saddened for the future of the Women's Relief Association and for the women's movement in the city. We have decided to resign from our duties immediately.</p>
<h3>Imitating Others' Registered Trademarks</h3>
<p>The Government Should Enforce the Law</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received an instruction from the Social Affairs Bureau stating that the Ministry of Industry ordered an investigation into the act of counterfeiting registered or unregistered trademarks with the intention of deceiving others. (Omission)... Recently, unscrupulous merchants have deliberately misinterpreted the provisions and, taking advantage of the lack of a specific clause for criminal punishment, have dared to counterfeit others' registered trademarks with the intention of profiting. This is a violation of others' rights and should be strictly reprimanded to make them aware that counterfeiting others' registered trademarks should be considered forgery. In the future, if there are any more cases of counterfeiting others' registered trademarks, the government, in order to protect trademark rights, will certainly enforce the law and punish them without leniency, so that they do not lightly attempt to break the law. The order instructs all merchants to comply, and forward this to the trade associations for compliance. etc.</p>
<h3>China Electric Workers Take New Mid-Autumn Holiday</h3>
<p>Tram Engine Rooms Still Operate Normally</p>
<p>As a rule, all workers of the China Electric Company have a one-day holiday every year on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, to encourage them. It is now learned that all workers of the company, in order to promote respect for the national calendar and abolish the lunar calendar, intend to take the holiday earlier and change it to the 15th day of the national calendar (today) as a day off for all workers. Yesterday, the Shanghai South Water and Electricity Workers' Union held an executive committee meeting and decided to send four representatives from the union's standing committee, Zhu Hanhe, Tang Junsheng, Xu Wangsheng, and Zhou Guangrong, to the company to meet with Wu Quesheng, director of the general affairs department, and Zhu Shaoqi, director of the transportation department. Both sides reached a satisfactory agreement. All workers and staff are allowed to take a day off on the 15th day of the national calendar (today). Except that the trams on each route will still operate normally and the engine room workers will also work normally, with double pay to show consideration, all other workers and staff will take a day off. If there are important tasks, a few people will still need to be retained to handle them.</p>
<p>Various Organizations</p>
<h3>Reports on Flooding in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Gaoyou Fellow Countrymen Association: To the esteemed editors of Shen Bao and other newspapers, Gaoyou is unfortunately beset by frequent calamities. Following the disasters of war, drought, and famine, we now suffer from devastating floods. Since the beginning of summer this year, incessant rains have persisted for months, causing lake and river waters to surge dramatically. Dykes and dams have collapsed entirely, leaving a vast expanse of water. Crops have been swept away, and homes are submerged. The dead float in the water, while the living cling to treetops for rescue. Wails of sorrow echo across the ravaged fields, a scene of heartbreaking pain. Such widespread devastation is rarely seen. We have already telegraphed Chairman Chiang, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Departments of Civil Affairs and Construction, the Central Party Headquarters, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, the China Relief Association, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, various provincial flood relief associations, the Jiangsu Relief Association, and various charitable organizations to report the dire situation and plead for urgent relief. Esteemed newspapers, long regarded as representatives of public opinion and voices of the people, we are now submitting a copy of our telegram and respectfully implore you to lend your powerful support in appealing for aid. May the surviving remnants of our community be given a chance to be reborn. The desperate victims will be eternally grateful. Our association also bows deeply in gratitude. Wang Taomin and others, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Provisional Gaoyou Association of Fellow Countrymen, respectfully submit. Enclosed is a copy of the telegram (titles omitted):</p>
<p>To the esteemed editors, Gaoyou is unfortunately suffering repeated calamities. In the years 1927, 1928, and 1929, successive droughts and famines occurred. Even paddy fields near water sources yielded little harvest due to the ravenous consumption of strange insects. Although planting was possible in 1930, the hardships endured from previous droughts and famines made it difficult to sustain livelihoods. The high cost of rice and exorbitant prices for rice seeds further impoverished the people, leaving many unable to purchase seeds and abandoning their fields. Moreover, rampant banditry and extortion became a daily occurrence. The suffering of the people of Gaoyou has been unbearable to witness. We had hoped for a good autumn harvest this year to alleviate their hardships, but unexpectedly, since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rains have caused the Huai River to overflow and the lake waters to surge. The dykes west of the lake have already broken. Although the eastern side is supposedly protected by the Yunhe (Grand Canal) dyke, the river workers have long indulged in self-enrichment in the dyke construction, so the repairs were as if there were no repairs. For example, the Jieshou Small Sluice Gate was in grave danger of collapsing. Despite repeated calls for repairs, the water conservancy authorities remained indifferent. During the recent surge in water levels, the sluice gate suddenly burst. Fortunately, the people of Jieshou risked their lives and spared no expense to build a temporary dam. Many other gate openings have also suffered breaches, causing the lower canals and ditches to overflow early. Combined with days of incessant torrential rain, the water depth in the plains has reached several feet. The current addition of lake swells leads to the simultaneous opening of three dams, which is as detrimental as dam breaks. The vast expanse of water is disheartening to witness. Crops have vanished without a trace, and homes have been swept away by the water. The strong stand on treetops, their cries for help echoing louder than a morning market. The old and weak lie dead on the water surface, drifting east and west, a scene too horrific to bear. The dead are gone, but the living are displaced, without shelter or food, crying out in despair, the fields filled with sorrowful wails, awaiting death. The extraordinary suffering is heartrending. This is the factual account of the devastation in Gaoyou, as reported by various sources. Even more heartbreaking is the information from young men from the disaster area who have come to our association, claiming that the old and weak have drowned and drifted away with the currents, making it impossible to find them. Homes have been washed away and shattered by the winds and waves, leaving no shelter. Some have escaped to Shanghai, seeking work as laborers and requesting our assistance in finding employment to survive. Our association is doing its best to help and provide relief. However, our association is newly established and lacks the resources and credit to do much. Besides introducing them to factories we know, we are at our wits' end and can only lament our helplessness. Alas, the disaster victims who have not found work are crying with hunger in Shanghai. Those coming to our association for assistance number several each day. Without rescue, the number of starving people in Shanghai will increase daily. Without urgent relief, the remnants of Gaoyou will have no hope of survival. All of the above situations are extremely urgent, and we feel compelled to make a heartfelt appeal to seek aid for the millions of disaster victims. Therefore, we humbly and boldly send this telegram to your esteemed office, beseeching you to understand the situation and to allocate substantial funds for the disaster area to provide urgent relief, enabling the suffering and dying victims to have a chance at rebirth. For those who have escaped to Shanghai seeking work, we urge charitable organizations, Shanghai officials at all levels, and factory owners to prioritize the employment of disaster victims from Gaoyou introduced by our association, regardless of wages. A single meal is as good as saving a life. Employing a thousand people is like saving a thousand lives. If this is granted, the disaster victims in both locations will be eternally grateful, and our association will bow ten thousand times in gratitude. Wang Taomin and others, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Provisional Gaoyou Association of Fellow Countrymen, respectfully submit.</p>
<p>Emergency Flood Relief Association: The Shanghai Association for Emergency Flood Relief received a telegram from Chen Diaoyuan, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government (titles omitted): I respectfully inform you that Anhui Province has experienced continuous torrential rains for more than ten days, causing rivers to rise simultaneously. The magnitude of the floods is unprecedented in decades. Hills have collapsed, valleys have overflowed, dykes have broken, homes have been destroyed, and people are trapped like fish. The land has become a watery expanse. The province also suffers the continuation of banditry. Following hail damage, the province now suffers from floods. Refugees are without shelter, famine is imminent, and families are separated by life and death. I am deeply distressed and cannot find peace, considering the severity of the disaster. I am concerned for the survivors. I have temporarily returned from an inspection tour, passing through Lu'an, Huoshan, Hefei in western Anhui, reaching Wuhu, and various counties along the Yangtze River, up to Huai'ning. The distance of several hundred miles is a vast expanse of water, a giant immersion. Countless people, livestock, and homes have been washed away. I have reviewed disaster reports and telegrams from other counties, with similar pleas for help. The disaster area covers almost the entire province. Wails of hunger and cries of sorrow fill the land. The sights and sounds are deeply disturbing. As the provincial leader, I have done my best to provide relief, but my efforts are limited. I have allocated funds and dispatched personnel to provide emergency relief to alleviate the immediate needs. To organize relief efforts and plan for reconstruction, given the severe shortage of funds in the treasury, the vastness of the disaster area, and the severity of the disaster, a cup of water is insufficient to extinguish a cart of fire, and a robe needs threads from many looms. You have long been known for your kindness and compassion, and your reputation extends far and wide. I have mailed donation ledgers, respectfully requesting your contributions, generously opening your purses, broadly soliciting donations, and eagerly awaiting your response. Your benevolence will be immense, and your virtuous deeds will spread far. I look forward to your prompt response. Chen Diaoyuan bows.</p>
<p>Relief Association: The China Relief Association has received telegrams from the Henan Provincial Relief Committee, reporting that Yanling, Shangqiu, Suiping, Shenqiu counties, Jiangsu's Huai'an and Baoying counties, Anhui's Wangjiang, Xiangcheng, Dangtu, and Hanshan counties have suffered from sudden and overwhelming floods. Lives have been lost to the waves, and homes have been destroyed by the wind and rain. Survivors have no place to escape and no time to call for help. Those fortunate enough to survive are exposed to the wind and sleep in the open, without a full meal for days. Floating corpses lie unburied, causing unbearable grief. The association urgently seeks relief efforts to save the survivors. The detailed and tragic situation is beyond description. The association desires to provide relief but lacks the resources. We trust that charitable people across the country, witnessing the widespread flooding, will have compassion and contribute their strength to save these dying victims.</p>
<p>Chinese Red Cross Society: The Chinese Red Cross Society yesterday continued to receive flood reports from various locations: (1) Hanshan, Anhui: The southwest half of Hanshan is entirely comprised of polder villages, bordered by Chaohu Lake above and the Yangtze River below. Since the beginning of summer, immense floods, accompanied by wind and rain, have arrived together. Simultaneously, over sixty large and small polders have been submerged. The last hope, the Yanglin Great Polder, although defended with all efforts, was ultimately breached on July 28 due to the overwhelming wind, rain, and water. The surrounding fields and homes, extending over a hundred li, have been washed away, leaving nothing behind. What is particularly tragic is that people could migrate gradually away from previous floods. However, this time, the water rushes from head to toe, from top to bottom, making migration impossible. In addition, the area suffered banditry last year, emptying nine out of ten homes in the surrounding villages. Combined with continuous rain during the wheat harvest, the transplanting of seedlings was hindered by water receding and rain accumulating for ten days. The majority of the mortgaged fields are now utterly devastated. Those who drowned have filled the bellies of fish, while the survivors are left naked and desolate, their faces like doves on the water's edge and on tombs. Cries of sorrow and sighs of lament fill the air. Those who did not die by drowning will die of hunger. This is an unprecedented disaster in recent decades, and the most severe calamity among the dozens of counties in Anhui. Being in the disaster area, how can we bear to witness this? We urgently seek relief to alleviate the suffering. We implore all great philanthropists to generously open their purses and for the elders of Anhui to contribute grain. We will bow deeply on behalf of the disaster victims in gratitude for the virtue of rebirth. Sincerely, the Second District Party Department and the Third District Public Office of Hanshan County, Anhui, and the Yuncao Township Chamber of Commerce. (2) Taixian, Jiangsu: To the Shanghai Chinese Red Cross Society, Taixian is unfortunately suffering from incessant rains that began on July 3 and have persisted for an entire month, causing the city walls to collapse in many places and countless homes to be destroyed. The water depth in the plains reaches several feet, and broken walls and ruined fences are everywhere. In the southeastern highlands of the county, boats are sailing on land, and soybean seedlings have been submerged. At that time, there was still hope for the crops in the northwest regions, which could have provided some relief if they had been harvested. Unexpectedly, the lake waters rose again, and the dams along the Yunhe Dyke were opened in succession, pouring water into Xinghua, Taixian, and Dongtai counties, causing even greater harm. According to surveys, the total rice production in Taixian County is approximately four million dan per year, with early rice accounting for about 30% and late rice being the majority. Since the beginning of summer, there have been torrential rains, with autumn weather arriving in summer. The development of crops , If the dams are protected until after the Beginning of Autumn, although the late rice will suffer losses, there is still early rice to harvest. However, with the dams opened before the Beginning of Autumn, the western waters flow directly to the lower reaches of the Yunhe River, directly impacting the northwest regions of Taixian County, becoming the tail end of the Huai River. The harvest of early rice is hopeless, and late rice is even more uncertain. As a result, all crops in the county have suffered damage, and the loss to the people's food supply and economy is immeasurable. Currently, farmers in various areas not only have no grain in their barns and no food in their mouths, but their villages have also become flooded, leaving them with no place to live. The strong scatter in all directions, while the old and weak are left to die in ditches. The tragic situation is beyond description. In addition to convening a Food Management Committee and a Flood Conference to stabilize rice prices, ban the export of rice, and strive for allocation, we dare to make a telegram appeal, respectfully requesting your society to quickly dispatch personnel, with funds, to Taixian to investigate and provide urgent relief, bestowing benevolence upon these survivors and enabling them to live. Sincerely, Pan Lu, Standing Committee Member of the Taixian County Party Department, Zhang , Magistrate of Taixian County, and various affiliated institutions and organizations. (3) Henan Provincial Relief Committee: To the Chinese Red Cross Society, the flooding in Henan Province has only worsened, with the tragic situation beyond words. According to the report from the Magistrate of Yanling County, the terrain of Yanling is low-lying. Since the beginning of summer this year, there have been more overcast days than sunny days. In early June, there were torrential downpours, with water depths in the plains reaching one foot. The villages of Dibai and Conggou were flooded due to the breaches of the Hongye River and Shuangbai River. The villages of Chengguan, Taocheng, and Nanwu were flooded due to the breaches of the Qingliu and Shahe Rivers, creating a vast expanse of water. Many people and livestock drowned, and the autumn harvest was washed away. The Baixian Relief Branch reported that on June 27, the sky was overcast and dense with rain, followed by a strong wind and heavy rain, continuing to this day, almost a month later, with no signs of clearing. The terrain of Tongyi County is mountainous, with rapid water flow. People, livestock, food, and clothing were all washed away by the floodwaters. Houses collapsed, and crops were destroyed. The Shangqiu County Red Cross Branch reported that continuous rain has been falling since the beginning of summer, damaging the autumn harvest. Unexpectedly, heavy rains fell again in mid-July, creating a vast expanse of water. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts in the south of the county are low-lying and completely submerged. Houses and livestock have collapsed and drowned, and the accumulated water cannot be drained. The disaster victims are still trapped in the mud. The association has learned that the counties, already suffering from harvest failures, have now been flooded, leaving them in a desperate state. We hope that your society will quickly organize urgent relief and allocate funds as soon as possible to bring the dead back to life. Zhang Fang, Henan Relief Committee. (4) Linyi Branch: To the General Office of the Chinese Red Cross Society, disaster has struck the people of Linyi, with both war and calamity arriving together. The threat of bandits has not subsided, and torrential rain has fallen again. Since the beginning of July, there has been heavy rain every day. From August 3 to 8, there were thunderstorms and torrential downpours, with water depths inside the city reaching several feet. Half of the residents have been affected by the flood, and homes have collapsed. The cries of lament are unbearable to hear. Outside the city, there is a vast expanse of water, and crops have been washed away. The water has not yet receded, making it difficult to investigate. Refugees inside the city are crying with hunger and are on the verge of death. Although over ten shelters have been set up to provide relief, the disaster is too great, and it is difficult to cope alone. We urgently request your assistance in providing relief so that the disaster victims of the entire county can have a chance at rebirth. Photos and forms will be submitted separately. The Linyi Red Cross Branch. (5) Nanling Flood Relief Fundraising Association: To the Chinese Red Cross Society, Nanling, located downstream of Huining in Anhui and bordering the river to the northeast, is prone to flooding whenever there is a torrential downpour. This time, mountain floods erupted together, with the force of a torrent. Large and small dams and polders collapsed one after another, a sight unseen since the founding of the Republic. Homes and livestock were washed away, a heartbreaking and indescribable scene. Currently, the fields are filled with sorrowful wails, and people are sleeping outdoors with empty stomachs, barely clinging to life. Our colleagues are deeply distressed by the plight of the displaced, and although our efforts are limited, we hope that you will generously provide aid and grain from afar so that the 100,000 disaster victims can receive substantial assistance. The high regard for your actions is etched in our hearts. We anxiously await your response. The Nanling County, Anhui, Flood Relief Fundraising Association. (6) Huai'an County: The previous report from our association, Xu Zhaojia and others, detailed the plight of our county and pleaded for the allocation of funds for urgent relief. However, on August 3, the Taiping Dyke collapsed again, further expanding the affected area and adding over 30,000 disaster victims who are exposed to the wind and sleep in the open, urgently seeking relief and needing even more funds. We implore your association to consider the severity of the disaster and the urgent need for relief, to quickly allocate a large sum of money and dispatch personnel to provide urgent relief and save lives. We respectfully beg on behalf of the disaster victims, The Huai'an County Flood Relief Association.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee: The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee received a telegram from Lijin, Shandong, stating that Lijin has experienced continuous heavy rains, causing the river level to rise sharply by seven feet. The dykes have been breached in three places, turning the area into a watery expanse. The crops have been completely submerged, and cries of sorrow fill the air. The Committee also received an official letter from the Chinese Red Cross Society in Shangqiu, Henan, stating that since the beginning of summer, Shangqiu has experienced continuous rain, lasting for over ten days without stopping. The crops have been completely submerged, and disaster has struck. Currently, over 500,000 women and children are in danger of being buried in the bellies of fish, and thousands of villages are surrounded by ghosts. The Committee also received a telegram on behalf of the Sichuan Fellow Countrymen Association (previously reported, omitted). The Committee also received a telegram from the Nanling County, Anhui, Flood Relief Fundraising Association, stating that disaster has struck. Continuous rains have fallen for over ten days. Nanling, located downstream of Huining and bordering the river to the east, is prone to flooding whenever there is a torrential downpour. This time, mountain floods erupted together, with the force of a torrent. Large and small dams and polders collapsed one after another, washing away homes and livestock. The scene is heartbreaking and indescribable. Currently, the fields are filled with sorrowful wails, and people are sleeping outdoors with empty stomachs, barely clinging to life. We earnestly hope for relief so that the 100,000 disaster victims can receive assistance. The Committee also received a letter from the Langxi County Government in Anhui, stating that Langxi, located downstream of the mountains of Guangde, experienced torrential rains last month for several days and nights, causing mountain floods to erupt with the force of a raging tide. All of the county's dykes and embankments were flooded and breached, creating a vast expanse of water. There was no place to provide rescue, and crops were submerged. Countless people and livestock were washed away. In two or three days, we managed to rescue several hundred thousand disaster victims who climbed onto the city walls to live temporarily. The remaining numbers are still being investigated, and we are rushing to dispatch personnel to provide urgent relief. The Committee also received a letter from the Datong Branch of the Anhui World Red Swastika Society, stating that Heyue Island in Datong is located in the middle of the Yangtze River, surrounded by dykes to the north, south, and west to prevent flooding. Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been continuous rain, causing disaster, along with the rising of the Yangtze River and the eruption of mountain floods. The west bank of the Yangtze River suddenly breached, and the north side was also flooded. Impoverished disaster victims are crying in despair, with no place to live, no clothing, and no food. Transportation is disrupted, and business is at a standstill, on the brink of collapse. We implore you to provide relief to the dying disaster victims. The Committee also received a letter from Dongliu County, Anhui, stating that the 100,000 mu of fertile fields in Bagu, Huguangfeng Polder, Dongliu, across from Anqing, and the 5,000 households are crucial to the people's livelihood. Unexpectedly, last month, the heavens turned against us, with strong winds and heavy rain persisting for days. The dykes and polders were completely breached, and rescue was impossible, creating a vast expanse of water. Homes were submerged, and countless people and livestock were washed away. The suffering people of Dongliu have experienced this disaster, clinging to life, exposed to the wind and sleeping in the water. Cries of sorrow fill the land, and the disaster victims are in urgent need of relief.</p>

<p>Taxpayers Association Letter</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Should Not Levy Land Tax on "Fang Dan" Properties</h3>
<p>Exercising Municipal Authority Inappropriately by Establishing Private Law for Landowners</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers Association wrote to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: We are writing in response to your letter No. 1552 of August 7 regarding the levy of taxes on "Fang Dan" properties, which we have read carefully. This matter is of great importance, and the Association must make the following clarifications to demonstrate that the levy of taxes on "Fang Dan" properties is an extra-legal act that the Council should immediately rectify and cease collecting. (1) The letter states that "there have been many cases of 'Fang Dan' properties paying taxes, as stated on pages 132 and 319 of Volume 1 of Judge Feetham's report, which largely states that 'Fang Dan' properties have never paid taxes." Whether or not "Fang Dan" properties should pay taxes is a legal question that will be discussed later. However, this point alone is enough to shake the confidence in adopting Judge Feetham's report. The levy on Fang Dan property is a concrete fact, while the report uses a very affirmative statement, saying that there was never a levy, this leads to two conclusions. One is that the person providing the facts knows that the levy on "Fang Dan" properties is a legally unauthorized act. If the judge knew this fact, it would make him think that "the principle of the rule of law" could not be said to be observed by the governing bodies of the Public Concession, or two, the person providing the facts to Judge Feetham overlooked it, or thought it was illegal and inconsistent with the principle of the rule of law, so they concealed it and said positive words to promote the law. However, from the first conclusion, the responsibility for not being honest lies with the person providing the facts, and the harm is small. If it is said from the second conclusion, if it is an omission, then Judge Feetham's report has omissions about extremely important facts, other things can be known, then the plan based on these facts can be called a complete error, as the saying goes, one wrong move, the whole game is lost. If it is hiding evil and promoting good, then in the moment of writing, there is partiality in the heart, independence and fairness are just empty talk on paper. (2) The letter states that "it must be read in conjunction with Section 8 on page 133 of the same report," implying that the Association's previous letter was quoting out of context. However, after rereading it, it further strengthens the Association's argument. According to the precedent of Mr. Bonar, a candidate magistrate, on March 4, 1914, which is a precedent of the British court, without the consent and approval procedures stipulated in Article 28 of the Land Regulations, it cannot be legally binding on our Chinese residents. In other words, our Chinese residents are naturally not obligated to comply with this precedent. It is also not true that "'Fang Dan' properties with new buildings will be taxed." "Fang Dan" properties along Tongfu Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Weihaiwei Road that have new buildings are everywhere where taxes are not paid. Those who pay taxes are only like Gu Shidi and others, who are forced to accept the restrictions of private law behavior under the pressure of a kind of force by those who have authority. (3) The letter states that "it is a fair move to tax 'Fang Dan' properties that have been developed and have greatly benefited from municipal facilities." The Association has long striven for fair moves, but they have not yet been achieved. Various unfair facts are not within the scope of this letter and will not be repeated here. However, the Association believes that unless the procedure stipulated in Article 28 of the Land Regulations is followed, the collection of taxes on "Fang Dan" properties is still legally unfounded. The Association does not wish to see the rule of law undermined. (4) The final paragraph of the letter states, "According to the agreement, the 'Fang Dan' properties of Gu Shidi and Wang Anfu should be taxed." (1) The Association believes that the conditions for paying land taxes attached to this agreement violate the provisions of the Land Regulations and are naturally invalid under the law, just as if a Chinese business owner permanently leased land to a foreigner without the approval of his responsible authority, the lease contract would naturally be invalid under the law. In short, if there is a legally granted power to levy "Fang Dan" taxes, there is no need to use private legal procedures. The collection of land taxes is the exercise of general municipal administrative power, and there is no need to enter into private legal contracts with each landowner. It may be said that contracts are sacred and cannot be violated, but contracts that violate national laws (including international covenants) are deemed invalid and unenforceable in whole or in part, and the same is true for cases similar to Gu and Wang, with no exceptions, for the sake of maintaining the rule of law. We hereby request that you investigate and handle this matter.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<h3>Actively Proceeding with Raising Funds for Grain Storage</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously proposed raising funds for grain storage and invited representatives from relevant parties to discuss implementation measures.

The entire plan and fundraising methods have been completely drafted and will be submitted to the Municipal Government for review today. As for the rumors that the Social Affairs Bureau has already purchased and stored rice, it is said to be completely untrue.</p>
<h3>A Rickshaw Puller Crushed to Death by a Chimney</h3>

Inadvertently, his head came into contact with a belt on the machine. The violent impact crushed his skull instantly, causing brain matter to splatter and blood to gush out. He collapsed and died on the spot. Workers in the workshop reported to the factory manager, who immediately sent personnel to report to the Sixth District Police Station and instructed the local neighborhood chief to report to the local court, requesting them to send personnel to inspect the scene.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang's Novel Obsession</h3>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: I recently read your report about Madam Sun's arrival in Shanghai. I was quite surprised by the section "The New Sound Society Reporter Talks with Madam Sun's Accompanying Secretary, Ms. Hu Lanqi, Former Member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government." Firstly, Lanqi accompanied Madam Sun on this trip to China in a friendly capacity and was not serving as her secretary. Secondly, Lanqi previously ran relief efforts in Jiangxi and was not a member of the provincial government. I am specifically requesting a correction to avoid reader misunderstandings. Respectfully, Hu Lanqi, August 14th.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Has Not Approved Registration of Private Schools</h3>
<h3>Ministry of Education's Handling Measures</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education reported to the Ministry of Education that all private secondary schools in the province, except Mingde Middle School in Jiaxing, have followed regulations and applied for registration. Currently, over thirty schools have been approved for registration by the Provincial Department and have been reported to the Ministry for record. More than ten schools, including Huangyan Fuya Junior High School and Jiangshan Hejiashan Junior Agricultural Vocational School, have also repeatedly applied for registration. However, due to unfamiliarity with the laws and regulations, there are many omissions in the reporting procedures. Furthermore, funding is insufficient, resulting in inadequate equipment. Although the Provincial Department has instructed these schools to make corrections, they still do not fully comply with the Ministry's regulations for registration, and thus cannot be immediately approved. The reason for this is different from those who are deliberately waiting and seeing. However, with the deadline approaching, the schools have been ordered to suspend enrollment in the first semester of the 20th academic year to show seriousness and provide supervision. However, since suspension of enrollment is different from closure, guidance is requested on how to handle this.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, after receiving the report, instructed the Provincial Department: "The reports are all noted. Since it is stated that Huangyan Fuya Junior High School and Jiangshan Hejiashan Junior Agricultural Vocational School have repeatedly applied for registration, they are not to be compared with those who are deliberately waiting and seeing. Although they do not fully comply with the registration standards, they should be given an opportunity to improve. As it is stated that after the deadline, the situation will be carefully examined, and either an order will be given to complete the process by a certain date, or they will be advised to convert to other types of schools, with the hope of greater improvement. It is proposed to extend the trial period (up to one academic year). The handling is not inappropriate. Those who have already started the registration process but have not yet submitted the forms to the Provincial Department, or have been instructed by the Provincial Department but have not yet replied, should be urged to submit their replies quickly before the registration deadline. The Provincial Department should consider the situation and handle them separately according to the above methods. As for Mingde Middle School in Jiaxing, if it still does not complete the registration procedures by the deadline, it should be ordered to close down to uphold the law. You must comply with this instruction and keep a copy of the report. This order."</p>

Any committee member who has proposals should submit them to the Ministry three days before the meeting, along with five vocational education topics: (1) Discussion of methods for training teachers for all levels of vocational schools; (2) Discussion of standards for establishing vocational schools; (3) Discussion of standards for establishing departments in vocational schools; (4) Discussion of internship methods for vocational schools; (5) Discussion of vocational guidance methods for primary and secondary schools.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Clarifies Education Association Issues</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a telegram from the Anhui Department of Education stating that the format of documents used by education associations at all levels has not been clearly stipulated. Furthermore, Article 19 of the Education Association Law stipulates that higher-level education associations should have their directly subordinate education associations as members. Therefore, are members of lower-level education associations also members of their directly higher-level education associations? Should the annual fees be paid to the county association, or should they also be paid to the district association to which it belongs? The Ministry of Education replied: Regarding the mutual correspondence between education associations at all levels, the central government has recently ordered a review by the Executive Yuan, and it has been reported that education associations at all levels are different from administrative organs. It is proposed that the format of official documents should be official letters. After the instruction is approved, it will be ordered to be followed. Furthermore, the tenth-level education association should have its directly subordinate education association as a legal entity, not the members of the lower-level education association. Therefore, individuals are also members of their directly higher-level education association. All members of the district education association should pay their membership fees separately to their respective district education associations and should not pay their membership fees directly to the county or city education associations. You must be informed and instructed to comply accordingly.</p>
<p>Questions Regarding Jinling University's Agricultural Science Enrollment Qualifications</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Has Clearly Explained</h3>
<p>Jinling University presented to the Ministry of Education the question of whether graduates of Category A agricultural old-system middle schools and old-system normal schools who have served in society for more than two years after graduation are qualified to apply to the school's agricultural vocational program. The Ministry of Education instructed that, according to Article 24 of Chapter 5 of the University Regulations, the entrance qualification for vocational programs requires graduation from a senior high school or equivalent school and passing the entrance examination. Therefore, graduates of Category A agricultural old-system middle schools and old-system normal schools who have served in society and have equivalent academic qualifications are not eligible to apply. You must be informed.</p>

It was also ordered to follow the procedures for applying for registration according to the regulations. If it refuses to comply, it will be shut down.

<p>No more than Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang. Qiu is the first singles, Jiang is the second singles, and Qiu and Jiang cooperate in doubles.</p>
<h3>Observations on the Situation</h3>
<p>Finals Will Be Between China and Japan</p>
<p>The Outcome of All Six Countries Depends on Doubles</p>
<p>The strength of the six countries is extremely balanced this time. In each of the four singles groups, each country can almost divide the wins and losses equally. The key to victory lies entirely in the doubles. Among the English, Japanese, and Portuguese teams, Japan is determined to win the championship with Hyosukio Tawara playing both singles and doubles. England and Portugal are probably no match. Among the Chinese, Canadian, and American teams, Canada is better than the US, and China is better than Canada. In the China-Japan final, each can win two groups in singles, and the outcome of the championship depends entirely on the doubles. If Qiu Feihai can defeat Hyosukio Tawara, then China will retain the championship without any problem.</p>
<h3>Venue and Tickets</h3>
<p>The battlefield is the Zhonghua Tennis Court. Tickets are divided into two types: one yuan and six jiao.</p>

<h3>A Word or Two</h3>
<p>— Qi Chan</p>
<p>The ways of the world change with wealth and influence, more so than with poverty and lowliness. The heart of jealousy is found more often within families than among outsiders.</p>
<p>Observe the hustle and bustle with a cool eye, and you will save yourself much trouble. Approach loneliness with a warm heart, and you will gain endless true joy.</p>
<p>The desire to seize profit and power is a bottomless pit, difficult to fill with ten thousand fathoms. The ambition to love the country and avenge its humiliation is regrettably only five parts full.</p>
<p>Women of ancient times were admired for their rustic charm. Women of today are admired for their modernity.</p>
<p>Those who embrace celibacy are surely those who have lost in love. Those who advocate birth control are surely those with a house full of children.</p>
<p>Do not speak of integrity to those who are obsessed with power and wealth. Do not discuss elegance with the vulgar. Better to remain silent than to speak and invite disaster.</p>
<p>The word "loss" is something that, if practiced throughout one's life, can be endlessly beneficial.</p>
<p>The pen of a lawyer, the blade of a warrior, and the tongue of a prostitute are all inauspicious things in this world.</p>
<p>Those who hate evil like the enemy are bound to suffer激变. Those who do not contend with the world will live out their natural years.</p>
<p>Young people today must be intelligent but not flaunt it, and talented but not boastful, only then will they have the strength to shoulder heavy responsibilities and travel far.</p>
<p>Retire from service when at the height of your powers, and live in a place that is secluded and quiet.</p>
<p>Powdered faces take the stage, with singing and music as loud as boiling water. Soon, the music ends, the crowd disperses, and the stage is empty. Everything in the world should be viewed in this way.</p>
<h3>The Strange and Magnificent Siemens Factory</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi, sent from Berlin</p>
<p>The day after I arrived in Berlin, I drove to visit the Siemens factory with my wife, Manhua, thanks to an introduction from Liang, the acting chargé d'affaires at the Chinese embassy in Germany. The factory is located in the western suburbs of Berlin, covering a wide area, hence the name Siemensstadt. There are elevated trains and trams that connect directly to the outside world. It is one of the largest factories in Germany.</p>
<p>The factory started in 1847, founded by Werner von Siemens, who initially ran a small electrical manufacturing business with a capital of only 20,000 marks and employing only 10 workers. Gradually, it developed, and in 1883, it moved to the suburbs and built its own factory buildings. Now, after 84 years, the number of workers has reached 110,000, and the capital has increased to 220,000,000 marks. Its electrical products, ranging from large items such as郵船, airplanes, railroads, bridges, and machine parts, to small items such as household electric stoves, electric cookers, and electric fans, are sold to countries all over the world. Its spirit of rapid progress is truly admirable.</p>
<p>During our visit, we were warmly received by Mr. F. Pohl, the chief engineer. Mr. Pohl spoke English, French, Italian, and other languages fluently. He led us to visit the exhibition hall, which was surrounded by various models, from the original generators to the latest equipment, all of which were available. The main hall displayed a bust of the founder, Mr. Siemens. He looked like an old man, reminiscing about the hardships of starting the business and his spirit and perseverance. We then visited the manufacturing department and saw various applied electrical machines that had been made, all kinds of them, constantly changing. I was not familiar with mechanical engineering, but I was amazed by the perfection of the equipment and the strictness of the organization.</p>
<p>At noon, the factory provided lunch. The dishes were very exquisite. According to Mr. Pohl, the factory kitchen uses electricity and can cook meals for 4,000 people in one hour. The power of electricity is evident here. Then, we went to a high building to get a bird's-eye view of the whole city. The factory buildings were lined up and the chimneys were everywhere. After that, we visited the kindergarten attached to the factory, which was used to educate the children of the workers. Other facilities, such as sports, entertainment, and housing, as well as all aspects of life, work, childcare, illness, and insurance, were all taken care of meticulously. We were also given exquisite publications as souvenirs.</p>
<p>The spirit of German science is sweeping the world. Recently, due to overproduction, worker unemployment, and economic exhaustion, it has reached this point. However, the spirit of patience, perseverance, and perseverance can break through difficulties and rebuild. It is an excellent example for us to work hard.</p>
<h3>Japanese Discover Historical Relics in Korea and Manchuria</h3>
<p>— You Xu</p>
<p>Japanese archaeological expert Dr. Kanai Yasuyama traveled to Manchuria last winter and collected many ancient artifacts from China and Korea. Recently, the doctor came to Hangzhou to travel and brought many kinds of ancient artifacts and ancient books. All the antiquarians rushed to visit him to get a glimpse first. According to the doctor, he has been researching historical sites in Korea and Manchuria for nearly twenty years and feels that the historical relics of Korea are the most difficult to collect. Now, he has unexpectedly found hundreds of historical materials, which is beyond his expectations. He also said that he found more than 130 kinds of inscriptions in Manchuria, most of which have not been discovered by the world. When he was in Manchuria, he and his colleagues Kin'ichiro Yagi and Nagaki Miyoshi obtained the consent of the consul-general in the area and engaged in excavation. Countless ancient coins, ancient mirrors, and ancient bronzes were discovered. In Ningguta, south of what was once the capital of the kingdom of Bohai, which was originally the eastern capital of the Jin dynasty, now called Dongjingchengzi, many ancient tiles and bronzes were unearthed. In Ningguta, they also found a bronze seal from the Jin dynasty and armor from the time when the Qing dynasty originated, all of which are rare treasures. Among the ancient books he brought, the most appreciated by antiquarians are the following: (1) Biographies of People, 80 volumes. (2) Selections from Eastern Literature, 80 volumes (3) Collected Bronze Inscriptions, 16 volumes (4) Bamboo and Wooden Slips of Genuine Works, 6 volumes (5) The Remnants of the Fire (History of Power Struggles in the Joseon Dynasty), 10 volumes (6) The Complete Works of Hongjae (Royal Compositions of King Jeongjo) (7) Records of the Court and Countryside (from King Taejo to King Sukjong). (8) Comprehensive Overview of the Court and Countryside (from King Taejo to King Gyeongjong). (9) Burgeoning History (from King Taejo to King Munjong). (10) Complete Korean Version of the History of Goryeo. Other rubbing copies of steles, such as the victory monument of the Qing Taizu's defeat of the Ming army in the east of Fushun, the inscriptions of the Jin Dynasty's "进士及第", and ancient bronzes, ancient tiles, and ancient coins, can all provide scholars with reference and have great value in history. It is a pity that they are all in the hands of the Japanese. How painful it is!</p>
<h3>A Letter to My Third Sister</h3>
<p>— Xu Bibo</p>
<p>That night, I got on a rickshaw with this heavy suitcase and a jar of sweet sauce, which was very inconvenient. The rickshaw puller probably hadn't eaten enough dinner, so he walked with a sway, and the swift legs turned into a slow pace. He was also so poor that he didn't even have a rickshaw lamp, and he just walked from a dark and remote place. When he happened to pass through a narrow alley, the rows of flesh on both sides (that is, those who were cooling off shirtless) often scolded him sharply for being uninteresting. I was also repeatedly sweating for him for no reason.</p>
<p>In the process of darkness, I caught a glimpse of the North Temple Pagoda by the light of the lightning. After arriving at the station, I hurriedly handed the return ticket to the porter, signed a delivery note, and hurried through the tunnel. The gigantic behemoth that swallowed Yunmeng also spewed white smoke and wriggled westward.</p>
<p>The train started. The cool wind in the sky did not treat people differently. It did not take sides and gave me, who was uneasy, a lot of coolness. However, the lovely North Temple Pagoda was getting farther and farther away.</p>
<p>Just as I was feeling lost and wondering, a girl in the next seat suddenly frowned and shouted "Hang Yu". I was very surprised and asked her. She said, "I have a headache, dizziness, and stomachache." I knew she must have had heatstroke, so I quickly poured the Chunzai Dew in my pocket into a teacup and gave it to her. In about ten minutes, she was suddenly all right. She thanked me and asked my name. But I was stunned because helping someone in need on the road is a very common thing, and there is no need to tell my real name. So I casually said, "Chen Kengran." I knew this lie would make me embarrassed later.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. I'm very sorry. How is your company developing recently? The day before yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that your wife, Ms. Qin Fang, was injured in the face by a stone. Has the scar healed now?" She asked me絮絮地like this.</p>
<p>I was really僵 at that time. I braced myself and simply told a big lie, hoping to stop her question. I said, "This is the advertising effect of the new film "The Dancing Girl's Blood". In fact, there is no such thing."</p>
<p>She was still unwilling to stop talking. She asked, "I heard that "The Dancing Girl's Blood" was written by the detective novelist Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing. Is that right? Who is the male lead?" She asked me like a waterfall. I guess this lady is also a迷咧.</p>
<p>"Speaking of the male lead, it is the famous Lin Xuehuai." I replied to her like this, answering every question. "?…"?…". "?…". She asked so many questions. But I pretended to doze off and ignored her.</p>
<p>I arrived at my residence at 11:30. My mother was still not asleep. But the home-style flavor that her old man longed for, sweet sauce, became a lost item of an unknown person in the train. This is really a pity and regretful thing.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from India (81)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>9th. During my time in India, apart from new cultural encounters, I also learned several key principles regarding animal psychology. I am now compiling them to demonstrate that the origins of war do not stem purely from materialism, but also from the physiology of the male sex. 1. Darwin stated that competition among male animals arises from vying for females, termed sexual selection. This differs from Marx's view. 2. I learned from an English lady about the example of male cats castrating kittens. 3. I learned from a Muslim scholar about male bears killing their cubs. 4. Also, from a monkey park, I learned about the example of male monkeys killing females. 5. Furthermore, I learned that male peacocks (i.e., purple-crowned chickens, found in Sichuan) steal their mothers' eggs to eat. It is also known that male birds like ducks and geese do not care for their chicks. Thus, the responsibility of nurturing young offspring is a motherly duty. 7. It is also known that mother hens can incubate duck eggs and are equally responsible for protecting those not born from them. All these key principles prove that world wars are caused by the initiation and organization of the male sex, and the underdevelopment and suppression of motherly nature and maternal rights. Marx also explained that some material inequalities can be resolved through the principles of neutrality and fairness, achieving moderation. Even the great power of influence, an invention of Indian psychology, should be adopted to nourish the human spirit. Marx's historical materialism is like giving food to the hungry, while the new spiritual liberation of India's Gandhi is lofty and far-reaching, free and generous, enough to provide humanity with the air to breathe, allowing narrow-minded societies to see the vastness of the universe, the height of the sky, the depth of the earth, the profundity of the sea, the light of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the beauty of flowers, plants, wind, water, and nature. An Indian told me that capitalists cannot have a conscience, and it is difficult to become a capitalist with a conscience. Gandhi used influence to transform them. Nevertheless, using both material and spiritual means aligns with the Chinese ideal of moderation, which is also Dr. Sun Yat-sen's theory of regulation. To compare and equate everything, achieving complete equality, is indeed very difficult.</p>
<p>India has many beautiful gardens. One had a deer, as large as a big sheep, weighing about eighty catties. I asked someone about its price, and they said it was only five to seven yuan. I imagine in China, it would cost dozens or even hundreds of yuan. I wanted to bring it back, but the shipping fee was too expensive. Someone said that peacocks are worthless in some places, cheaper than chickens in China. Yet, we Chinese regard peacocks as phoenixes. Truly, things are valued for their rarity. There will surely come a day when gold is worth the same as dirt.</p>
<p>In a school, there is a pagoda made of marble, where incense and flowers are offered morning and evening. I asked a student, "Which deity is this?" He replied, "This is the goddess of wisdom, named Saraswati." I asked, "Do all schools have this?" He said, "Most private schools have it, but government schools may not." I note that Greece also has a goddess of wisdom, who is also female. Chinese books like "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Flowers in the Mirror" advocate that women's wisdom surpasses that of men. Indian books say that women are four times as intelligent as men. According to this, it proves that if the world is to be guided by true wisdom in the future, we must study women's education. Perhaps this is why Indian schools venerate the goddess of wisdom.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Report</p>
<h3>Women, Women (20)</h3>
<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>Mr. Li was originally a busybody, and when he heard that the woman outside was looking for Lu Rongqing, he naturally felt he had to get to the bottom of it. They went outside together and saw the woman still sitting outside the guardhouse, her face full of disappointment and anxiety, silently wiping away her tears.</p>
<p>The group of people stopped in front of her.</p>
<p>"Why are you looking for Lu Rongqing? What is he to you?" Mr. Li asked directly.</p>
<p>"Lu Rongqing is my husband…" she only answered this one sentence, the rest of her words choked by tears.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Li heard that Lu Rongqing was her husband, he felt it was a very important discovery. He thought to himself that his opportunity for revenge had arrived, and he felt greatly relieved.</p>
<p>He deliberately said to her, "It's no use looking for him here. To be honest with you, Mrs…. Mrs. Lu! Your Mr. Lu has found a good place in Shanghai. Unless you go there to find him…" Mr. Li laughed coldly a few times. The group of people also started to discuss, some feeling strange, some feeling miserable, and those who knew about Mr. Lu and Miss Ding felt that this was a good show to watch.</p>
<p>"Yes! I know, and I have seen him. He has a woman in Shanghai! That's why I came to ask him. Thank you, gentlemen, can you take me to him? I would be very grateful!" she said, her voice full of tears.</p>
<p>"Since that's the case! Then I'll tell you! The woman's surname is Ding, she lives at 1452 Tongfu Road. It's not convenient for me to take you, so I'll hire a car to send you there!" Mr. Li said with a smile.</p>
<p>Lu Rongqing's wife, hearing that her husband had been located, stood up and thanked Mr. Li several times, following him out of the school gate. Mr. Li hired a rickshaw for her, paid the fare in advance, and sent Mrs. Lu to find her husband. As she got into the car, Mr. Li shouted loudly, "Remember! Surname Ding! 1452 Tongfu Road! A small Western-style house! There's a tree in front of the door!"</p>
<p>The rickshaw pulled away. Mr. Li was naturally very pleased. Turning back, he said to the group of onlookers, "Okay! You just wait! There's probably going to be a lively palace coup at our queen's place!" He laughed heartily as he spoke.</p>
<p>The group of people understood the meaning. Several people, upon hearing that this matter was related to Miss Ding, the school's "queen," wanted to follow to see what would happen. However, Mr. Li stopped them, saying, "Let's go hear the news tomorrow! If we go now, everyone will lose face!"</p>

<h3>Gold Market Before Swap</h3>
<p>Result Slightly Lower by Two Taels</p>
<p>Some Had Already Done Swaps: Yesterday, the gold market, with 14 bids, started firm but then weakened. The situation was generally stable, with slight fluctuations. From morning till night, there were differences of about six taels. In the end, it continued to fall by two taels. Trading was still not substantial. The early morning rise was probably due to the reported decline in silver prices. Subsequently, major players sold off heavily. When the foreign exchange rate initially stabilized, the situation became weak. It briefly broke through the 770-tael mark, but then buyers seemed to increase, and it became milder. The afternoon market continued its downward trend with very slight fluctuations. Finally, it ended at slightly above 71 taels. The swap period has arrived. However, since the 16th falls on a Sunday, it was brought forward by one day, starting at 8:00 AM this morning. However, most of those eager to do swaps had almost finished by yesterday afternoon. Upon learning of this, the exchange immediately intervened to enforce the regulations and prevent private trading. However, with so many people and the chaos, unofficial transactions were unavoidable. It is said that some had already mutually agreed on swaps based on the listed price, with the seller paying out three taels.</p>
<p>Early Morning Rise: The September opening added three cents, reaching 773 taels and 8 cents. Large transactions were unchanged. American silver fell by one-eighth, and private telegrams dropped by sixteen-three points. American stocks rose. However, the situation was the opposite of the previous day. Buyers were active in the market. Traders such as Zhifeng, Yongyuan Cheng, Yongyuan Chun, and Cuichang Yong all continued to buy, pushing the price up to 75 taels and 2 cents. Many settled their British gold positions, with various firms selling November contracts at 12.5625. Subsequently, Bingxing, Yuanmao, Yongchang Sheng, Yongheng Yu, and others all sold, and prices fluctuated. When the British gold price remained unchanged, the market was at 73 taels and 1 cent, continuing to fall by more than four taels. At nearly 10:00 AM, it was at 68 taels and 5 cents. British gold seemed weak. Shanghai bought September contracts at 5625, and Zhengjin bought November contracts at 625. Various firms changed their strategy, stopping buying and instead selling. Subsequently, Fuchang, Daxing, Yong, and material hedgers re-entered the market and even pierced through the 70-tael mark, reaching 72 taels and 6 cents. Soon after, it was suppressed to 70 taels and 3 cents due to sales by Wanxing, Shunli, Qianchang, and Xiang. The Bank of China in Shanghai mutually traded October British gold at 625. It was also heard that a telegram from Mumbai offered to sell October contracts at 625. The situation remained complex and uncertain, hovering between 71 and 72 taels. Until 11:30 AM, Fuchang, Yuanmao, Yongchun, Yuan Yong, and others bought in, especially as the Indian exchange rate was reported at a small 6 annas. At 11:45 AM, it was at 73 taels and 78 cents. Bingxing, Dacheng, and Dalian assisted in selling, so it fell again by more than one tael, immediately retreating to 2 taels and 2 cents, then immediately increased to 3 taels and 4 cents. By noon, it closed at 2 taels and 8 cents, returning to just over 2 taels. The opening price was calculated at 819 taels, pressing down 46 to 50 taels. The afternoon price was 45 or 46 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Stability: The afternoon opened at 72 taels and 1 cent, then continued from 1 tael and 9 cents to 2 taels and 9 cents. Trading was sparse. The recent Indian exchange rate lengthened while the forward rate shrunk, not exceeding 2 annas of difference. Subsequently, due to the September British gold being able to settle at 5625, it reached 1 tael and 7 cents, and then Yuanxing Yongyuan Mao Yong bought in, reaching 3 taels and 1 cent by 2:30 PM. A state of stability followed until 3:30 PM when the Indian exchange rate was reported at a large 34 annas, immediately dropping to 71 taels and 3 cents. There were several cent fluctuations afterward, and at 3:45 PM, the Indian exchange rate returned to a small 4 annas, immediately adding to 2 taels and 2 cents. However, the number of transactions was still very small. The market closed at 4:30 PM at 71 taels and 3 cents. Most retail investors, due to swap relationships, had to sell, falling again by 2 taels and 2 cents from the previous day. It has been falling for three consecutive days, totaling more than 10 taels. According to the largest price of the day, 75 taels and 2 cents, and the smallest price of 68 taels and 5 cents, the difference was 6 taels and 7 cents.</p>
<p>Active Bar Trading: The morning market for materials was 3 taels and 8 cents, noon closed at 2 taels, the afternoon was 2 taels and a half, and the closing price was 1 tael and 3 cents. The quoted price was calculated to be pressing down 46 or 47 taels, registered at 71 taels to 73 taels, interest compensation at 71 taels, afternoon 69 taels. Spot bar trading was still active. The Tianjin group bought more than 5,000 taels from Yingfeng Heng and others, and the firm also received more than 1,000 taels, sold by Yezhong Yinlou and others. Subsequently, seekers followed one after another, but suppliers were very few.</p>
<p>Normal Trading: According to the statistics of transactions by various firms on the exchange floor, Cuichang Yong, Dadecheng, Chunyuan Yong, Yongheng, and Fuchang all bought in. Yuanmao Yong, Tongtaichang, Bingxing, Juli, Dacheng, and Wanxing all sold. Yuantai and Yuanchun Hengyu showed mixed buying and selling. Futaiheng also bought in, and Changsheng Yong and Fuyu also sold. In the afternoon, Dadecheng and Yuanmao Yong bought in and then sold out. Yuanxing Yong and Cuichang Yong all bought in. Shunli, Wanxing, Bingxing, Yuantai, Tianxiang, and Futaiheng sometimes bought in and sometimes sold out. Yiyu, Chengfeng Yong, and retail investors all sold out. It was heard that speculator Mr. Wu sold slightly in the morning. The Dalian group sold 1,500 to 1,600 bars (mostly long positions being unwound) and then bought 500 to 600 bars. The Guangdong group remained inactive.</p>

<h3>Securities: Seven and Eight Month Term Suddenly Rises by One and a Half Yuan</h3>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Markets Fluctuating and Unpredictable</h3>
<p>The yarn market started rising but fell at noon. Recent changes have been rapid, making it difficult to predict. Speculators are unusually enthusiastic, with varying degrees of increase and decrease. However, large players sell heavily when prices rise, overwhelming the market. In reality, the cotton market is poor, and the yarn market also fluctuates. Market sentiment is tighter this month, as the Yunnan group is actively buying 10-count coarse yarn, with asking prices exceeding 3.4 taels. However, the future situation is difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>Human Label Starts Bright, Weakens at Noon: The Human Label opened with a slight rise in American cotton. Retail investors bought in, and market sentiment was firm. Each price rose by 7 or 8 qian. In the afternoon, raw cotton trended down, and the market suddenly fell by 6 or 7 qian to 1 or 2 qian. A total of 44,400 bales were traded. It was found that Ruidai sold 3,000 bales, Changfeng 1,850 bales, Jifeng 1,300 bales, and Deji 1,100 bales. Gongtai bought 1,400 bales, Rongxing 2,100 bales, Gengfeng 2,800 bales, Hengyi 1,300 bales, and Yichang 1,450 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Human Label Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Balance</p>
<p>Closing Price; Increase/Decrease; Balance</p>

<p>September, 152.1; 178; October, 151.9; Down 5; 98,400; January, 152.7; 5,519</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Still Not Bad: Sales of current yarn are still good. According to statistics, various groups bought a total of 1,300 bales throughout the day. The same industry bought 420 bales, domestic customers bought 250 bales, Shantou bought 55 bales, Qingdao bought 175 bales, Yunnan bought 855 bales, and miscellaneous groups bought 60 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Trends from Flat to Low</h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning but fell at noon, changing very rapidly. However, major players sell as much as possible when prices are high. In the afternoon, rumors circulated in the market that the US Department of Agriculture and various state governors would destroy one-third of American cotton. There was great fear that this would not happen, so market sentiment was very weak, and many retail investors closed out their positions, causing the market to fall sharply. The future situation is still difficult to improve significantly.</p>
<p>Han Label Chaos: The Han Label opened with a slight rise in American cotton, and people's hearts were still calm. Each month was flat. In the afternoon, due to bad news about American cotton, each month fell by 5 or 6 qian. A total of 133,500 dan were traded. It was found that Dafu sold 3,900 dan, Hengda 16,300 dan, Ruidai 6,000 dan, Tongxing 2,000 dan, and Xincheng 3,100 dan. Shenchang bought 2,400 dan, Jifeng 5,500 dan, Gongtai 3,500 dan, and Yichang 5,500 dan. Yi Yu and others bought 3,400 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Han Label Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Balance; August, 3370; Down 45; November, 3400; Down 55; 194,700; September, 3400; 34,000; December, 3495; 255,900; October, 3395; 179,900; January, 3390; 164,200;</p>
<p>Cotton Demand Mediocre: Trading of current cotton is still mediocre, it is said.</p>

<h3>Rice, East New Japonica, Small Drop of Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>South Market: Yesterday, the sources from various gangs arrived at approximately 26 or 27 ships. Combined with yesterday's remaining stock in the port, there were over 40 ships in total. As urban and rural shops observed the continuous arrival of goods, the market showed signs of slackness. Moreover, there were reports of firmness in the North Market, resulting in few transactions. The accumulated stock felt even more stagnant. The market prices did not open yesterday due to the extended grace period in the North Market, which caused a significant difference between the North and South. Today, the market was re-evaluated, and prices increased compared to yesterday and the day before. However, the overall trend is softening, and people are closely monitoring the situation. Recently, the price of foreign rice has slightly weakened, making a small correction in the future not surprising. It is rumored that Zhejiang province has imposed a ban on transportation, and the inland stocks are weak, making it difficult for prices to fall.</p>
<p>New Wharf: Yesterday, around 40 boats carrying clams and other goods from Changshu and Xixi arrived. The morning market was quite active. Various shops and firms are buying up stocks in light of the end of the small month on the Gregorian calendar, which will lead to prices going up, and due to the relatively low price of rice. 3,000 bags of thin rice were added to the market, causing the price to rise by six or seven jiao compared to before. Nearly 1,000 shi of thick Japonica rice were sold retail at two or three chi above the price. Lu Yang top grade and "Bian Yuan Wei" were slow, with fluctuating prices. Yesterday, 200 bags of Pudong new Japonica rice arrived, but trading in this street was stagnant, with a drop of half a yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Drops Two to Three Jiao Again</h3>
<p>Tianjin Merchants Slightly Stocking Up</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market showed no signs of recovery. The current high prices are due to the impact of the floods, with merchants from the Yangtze River region buying heavily, followed by local firms and hoarders. No. 1 Saigon rice jumped to over sixteen yuan, and all grades increased sharply, with prices flying up by over five yuan compared to when foreign rice first arrived in Shanghai. As the floods in various areas receded slightly, the amount of rice purchased was sufficient for use. New river rice has arrived in the city for supply, making merchants unwilling to pay high prices for purchases. The market saw a drop, with prices gradually falling by one or two yuan. Yesterday, Japanese customers continued to show little interest, and the existing stock was sufficient. Ordered goods are on their way and will arrive soon, making people even more bearish. Morning observations indicated a sharp downward trend. Merchants from Tianjin began to take advantage of the situation and slightly stock up on Min Dang rice. Local firms and retailers also followed suit by stocking up on Annam Japonica and small-grain rice, which helped stabilize the market. However, compared to 500 bags at fourteen yuan and a half to thirteen yuan and eight jiao, 1,000 bags of Kolkata rice at fourteen yuan, 300 bags of Annam Japonica rice at fifteen yuan and three jiao, and 300 bags of small-grain rice at thirteen yuan and eight jiao and a half, the prices were still relatively high.</p>
<h3>Futures Flour Finally Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening of trading in the morning and afternoon, the market for various months generally showed a flat and weak trend. As quoted prices for foreign wheat dropped again by a small margin of one or two jiao or so, insiders and outsiders believed that the factories would continue to place orders for foreign wheat, and the chips thrown out were all solid goods. Moreover, the excessive supply abroad would not decrease due to the increased demand in China. The bulls, concerned about this, could not avoid feeling discouraged. Therefore, the bulls in the area of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway gradually withdrew their positions, with only merchants from the Yangtze River region continuing to aggressively buy in, reaching around 300,000 bags. However, with most people bearish, the price finally fell. As a result, August and September fell by one and a half fen compared to the previous day, October fell by one fen and two and a half li, November fell by a small two and a half li, and December and January fell by a small five li.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Is Weak and Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening of trading in the morning and afternoon, showed a generally weak and stagnant trend for various months. Since the large bull operators in the current month had completely sold off their positions at the high prices, the current bulls are all inexperienced, resulting in a force that is no match for the bears, who are gradually reducing the prices. The prices for the distant months were inevitably weak due to the oversupply of foreign wheat, causing many to actively sell off their positions. As a result, both August and September fell by three fen compared to the previous day, while October to December fell by four fen. Spot wheat is in a tight situation due to the lack of incoming shipments. 2,100 bags of Kai Yi Wei, Shuangfeng, Anting, Pudong, Weiting, Penglai Waigang wheat were handled by Fuxin Huafeng.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Lanxi Jujubes Arrive Fresh</h3>
<p>Fresh Lanxi jujubes have continued to enter the market, with good quality. Yesterday, the wholesale market called out a selling price of forty taels. Other grades continued to follow the usual trend of price reductions, and the trend was relatively stable. Top-quality goods have not yet arrived, but new goods are expected to appear in a few days.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Double Cocoon Long Filaments Priced High</h3>
<p>Price opened at one hundred and sixty-four taels: The price of double cocoon cocoons continues to rise firmly.</p>
<p>This year, the production of double cocoon cocoons in various regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been poor, while the demand from double cocoon silk factories has increased. In addition, Japanese firms took the opportunity to raise prices and search for purchases, causing cocoon prices to rise. The price of double cocoon long filaments is also firm and high. Yesterday, Sanjin Silk Factory purchased 15 dan of double cocoon silk long filaments at a price of one hundred and sixty-four taels.</p>
<h3>European Firms Replenish Yellow and White Factory Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market showed no signs of recovery in European sales. Overseas silk telegrams showed little activity in Shanghai. Only English and French firms replenished their stock of yellow and white factory silk. Jardine Matheson and others imported 20 bales of white factory silk and 10 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, with prices remaining firm.</p>
<h3>Luzhuang Zhenmei Rises Again and Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, handled by firms such as Jardine Matheson, Harmony, Jinlong, and Tongfu, seeing that the existing stock in the market was low, the supply was scarce, and the overseas demand was urgent, once again began to actively search for purchases. Top-grade Zhenmei with stems rose to two hundred and fifty-six taels, Wubei Zhenmei rose to one hundred and seventy-eight taels, and Tunxi ordinary Zhenmei rose to one hundred and thirty taels, an increase of twenty-thirty taels compared to before. The upward trend was like a rapid rise to a high position. Other items such as Needle Mei, Xiumei, and bulk tea also saw a uniform increase of five or six taels. Even Gongxi, which in recent days has been purchased by many traders to be reworked into other export grades, has seen a firming trend in the market. The tea market has shown a very stable trend.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Crossing the River for Banquets, Broadcloth Sales Are Brisk</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been demand for Yuan Chang's plain broadcloth in blue-gray, especially with the Sichuan merchants being the most active. The ordinary two liang two or three qian grades are particularly scarce and sell well. Ning Feng's banquet broadcloth number one, two, three, and four sold over ten boxes yesterday, all from the firm's existing stock. Wholesale prices are two liang two qian eight and a half fen net for plain color, two liang three qian five fen for blue-gray, and one liang nine qian for dark green. The market sales are quite smooth, and customers continue to demand more. It is heard that the firm's new goods have not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the stock in the warehouse is limited, so they will soon increase the price by several fen per yard.</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's Diary of the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>Another question discussed at this meeting was that the Allied forces must end this great war in 1919. In a letter I sent to Mr. Clemenceau the other day, I asked him to organize the new recruits of the 1920 class into teams starting in October 1919, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>"1919 will be the decisive year of the Great War. In the spring of that year, the strength of the American army will reach its peak. If we want to shorten the war, our army must step up its fierce attacks from then on. We must pay attention to the Allied forces obtaining sufficient replenishment and maximum supply." I said at the end, "The stronger our army is, the faster the victory will be, and the more we will be listened to."</p>
<p>On July 24, I wrote to all commanders in the same vein, asking them to list the reliable manpower, guns, airplanes, tanks, and military transport vehicles of each army at the beginning of 1919.</p>
<p>I particularly emphasized that not only should we maintain but also expand the superiority of our army's tanks and artillery. Therefore, I asked the commanders to urge their respective governments to step up the construction of such urgently needed military equipment.</p>
<p>On July 26, Commander Pétain expressed his agreement with the war plan in writing and added his opinion, arguing that our army's offensive on the Saint-Mihiel salient "and the clearing of Amiens should be the main goals in the offensive taken in late summer and early autumn. The strength of the French army in 1918 may be exhausted, but this is expected to achieve useful and certain results."</p>
<p>The other two commanders did not provide written replies other than verbally agreeing.</p>
<p>The Allied forces began their offensive in August 1918.</p>
<p>The Allied forces are now preparing to begin the second offensive on August 8.</p>
