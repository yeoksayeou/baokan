<p>時評</p>
<h3>救濟水災與民族之興替</h3>
<p>當七月間水災發生之初。本報即撰有（霪雨之禍）及（急救水災）兩評大聲疾呼。冀以引起政府與國人之注意。繼又撰有水災叢評及緊急之民食問題等。縷陳利害。呼籲急救。并謀所以善後。記者始意。以爲洪水雖虐。要皆人力所能挽救。又以爲爲禍尙淺施以應急之防禦與救濟。災區不至擴大災情不至達到若何嚴重。然而日復一日。旬复一旬。報災與請賑之文電。雪片飛來。政府查災員始緩步以出發。後以賑務會許主席多時之奔走呼籲。復以政府當局之惻然動其仁慈。毅然提議。乃有國府水災委員會之設立。發行公債。派遣放賑大員。賑務乃略有端倪。然而災情則日益深重矣。</p>
<p>吾人以爲政府具有絶大之權與能。即握有絶大之力。力之發動。繋於一念之轉移。我國家雖國庫艱難。民力凋敝。但嚮使當局惻然一動其念。則洪水之來。防禦雖已不及。救濟豈遂無方。事在人爲。特患人之不動念不肯爲耳。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者。此次水災。非若尋常。被災人民。達五千萬以上。被災之地。尤爲素稱富庶與產米之區。我國家財政。年苦窘迫。然而剜肉醫瘡。所賴以支持危局者。則以尙有此號稱富裕之區。竭其力以供應之故。今則江南河北。汪洋一片。匪禍未已。水刧随之。無貧無富。同歸於盡。即此五千萬災民之生命不足惜。我國家今後抑將何以圖存。故此而不救。民固孑遺難保。國亦將無以爲國。國家與民族生存所繋。絶非尋常之災禍可比。此則我政府與國民所應切實認淸者也。</p>
<p>東鄰日本。海嘯地震幾爲不可避免之定期刧運。然而人以堅忍卓絶之精神。日與其命運作艱苦之奮　。一九二三年東京地震全成瓦礫。今日瓦礫塲上。更完美更都麗之新東京。復屹立炫示於世人之眼目。此即勇往奮　之新興民族性。足以復興國家之明證。（他山之石。可以攻錯。）我民族爲求生存計。爲求延續其生命計。此種奮　之民族精神。詎其可少。我民族之所以表現其奮　精神者。萬目睽睽。實繋於此次水災之救濟與復興。</p>
<p>此次宋母之喪。蔣主席不遠千里。來滬執紼。哀思未已。復趕赴江西匪區不避溽暑。跋涉奔馳。仁念孝思。昭然爲萬衆所共覩。但此次洪水。死者暴露生者待死。億萬之衆。同罹浩刧。目前情形之慘重。固不輕於江西之匪禍未來之隱　。或更甚於今日之贛匪。老吾老以及人之老。幼吾幼以及人之幼。吾人更深望蔣主席擴大其仁念與孝思。移其溽暑長征之車騎。一親往災情最重之武漢視察。而謀所以救急與善後之道。是則五千萬災民之幸。亦即我國家我民族前途之福也。記者救助無能。惟有以秃筆鄭重致其哀懇之忱於具有偉大之權與能者焉。</p>

<p>急賑會設駐京滬籌賑處</p>
<p>漢口通信、自漢市被淹、武昌亦相斷被水、昨日漢陽又遭淹没、武漢三鎭、遂無一片乾土、人民流離轉徙、所望苟延殘喘者、至此亦已成爲絶望、馮夷肆虐、一至於此、誠可浩嘆、爰將連日情形、續爲披露如左、</p>

<p>及時得救坎將德孚三發三下、全場受震、邱氏數次順抽、悉中要害、轉成三三和局、江道章加上二鞭、奪來一局、絶處逢生令人一快、坎將以把網得勢、打成二一之比、邱氏發球、軟中带勁、乃見二二和數、逐第各勝一局、打來索然毫無生氣、第七第八兩局、中華驟然握得極峯優勢、征克對方、而成五與三比、邱抽失勁、江弱暴露、五五和數忽來、邱江及時而起、步　整齊、撃抽俱妙、第一盤於是得救、以七比五取勝、　　驚人表演本專家推測、坎將第一盤成績、無甚出色、按此而往、二三兩盤、不難預知、然而努力與奮　、竟使坎將拘回阨運、敗中取勝、惟其以已之長、攻人之短、策略之高妙、有足多矣、第二盤之後、江道章幾成敵方衆矢之的稍一不愼、即遭人算、邱飛海失其平日千鈞睕力每往失利如當惡運、第二盤之第六局、里特撲地救起一球、非擅長於足球者、萬難出此、是球一勝成四與二比而六比三之勝、即由是而來第三盤邱江技藝咸無所示見、惟德孚里特驚人表演、不絶發現、勝負之勝、可想而知、第四盤努力對持甚久、當中華在三比五失勢之下觀衆燥急特甚陣陣掌聲、莫不冀張我軍威、克彼强敵、不負所望成四比五、希望漸生、德孚發球、乘隙直人、終以六比四勝第四盤</p>

<h3>敎師登記應口試</h3>
<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>上海市敎育局。舉行小學敎師登記。一年一度迄今已歷四屆。八月十七十八。爲口試敎師期。地點在敎局。一般靑年男女。冒暑來自四方。蝟集一棠。煞是可觀。爰記其大概於次。</p>
<p>口吃不止　曩昔賈長沙輩。注意太子太傅。蓋敎育爲立國根本也。依據總理民權主義。則今日之小國民皆太子矣。小國民之師傅。豈可忽視。故小學敎師登記尙焉。登記宗旨。原在鑑别。歷屆登記。僅憑一紙證書。二張表格。三幀照片。兹爲鄭重計。改絃易轍。除體格檢查外。復經口試。口試由敎局内二分任之。每組二人。認眞萬分。胆怯者往往面灰脣白。口吃不止。都謂此後坐冷板凳者。亦一年難一年矣。</p>
<p>常識欠缺　口試共别五類。思想·語言·態度·經騐·常識是也。有人詢及今日敎育部長爲誰。滬市敎育局何氏。上海現有幾多市校。中國敎育宗旨爲何。國民政府成立以來舉行若干次全國敎育會議。國民敎育與民衆敎育區别何在。瞠目不能答者。頗不乏人。有人問當今俄首領何人。第三國際在何國施行諸問題。答不出者。方寸不安。以爲將不及格。實則幸未答復。否則其思想行將受局人之注意矣。某敎師御西裝上身外套旣云。領頭領結又缺。襯衫褂出袴外。批評員見之。立下逐客令。旋商懇至再。不知其結果如何。</p>
<p>僧多粥薄　滬市一屆登記敎師共四六二。二屆爲七四七。三屆達七五八。此次計六三三。總合二五九八人。市立小學不過一八五所。敎師全數一○六六。登記敎師全體逾二倍半。尙抱向隅。供過於求。今日中國到處如是。敎育界猶次焉者。上季蘇俄在校兒童爲一七五○萬。敎師九○萬。較諸帝制時最多祗七○○萬學生五○萬敎師。相去何止倍數。可見國家統一。國防鞏固。生產發達急不可緩。</p>
<h3>靈魂牀</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>哲學家之解釋靈魂。指靈魂爲體魄外之精神實體。一般迷信宗敎者流。遂有靈魂不滅之說。然儒家往往闢之如司馬温公云。形旣朽滅神亦飄散。神者。即靈魂之謂也。最近德國醫學博士密克琪多氏。曾發明一靈魂牀。可以衡靈魂之分量。斯亦奇矣。博士主持某大醫院事。特製一牀。有磅秤之機能。病人呻吟其上。可以其體之輕重。而知其病之增減。法至便也。一日。博士在隔離室。騐視垂死之病人。方騐視間。而某病人遽爾氣絶。某病人固奄臥於磅秤之牀者。人一氣絶。磅數忽突減博士乃加以研究。知人賴呼吸而生。一呼一吸中。含有若干量之水分。呼吸止。水分消失。磅數自應減少。但總無如是相差之甚也。於是博士遂决定所突減之分量中。除水分外。即爲靈魂之散滅。從此一再試騐。靈魂之輕重。得以是牀衡之。而靈魂牀之名稱。一時轟動西歐。各醫院正在紛紛仿製中云。</p>
<h3>北站花絮</h3>
<p>— 綺</p>
<p>自宋案發生後。兩路警備。愈益加嚴。原有東西南三面門可以出入。現則西向之門業已下鍵。日間僅餘東南二門通行。夜則南門亦緊閉。惟大門開放而已。每一入口。必站立軍警三五人。有警備司令部之兵士。有市公安局之警察。有兩路之路警。客之携带手囊者。必經檢查。始得入站。有某甲趕車赴京。抵站時距開車已不過五分鐘。方擬從容購票登車。乃軍警勒令檢查。翻箱倒篋。久久始已。入站而車已云遠矣。不禁懊喪欲絶。除檢查行囊外。對於旅客身畔。亦施搜索。其嚴密可知也。自郭承恩接局長篆後。近爲懲前毖後起見。特組一專門委員會。討論對於要人出入之保護方法。亡羊補牢。亦未始非杜斷隱患之要着也。</p>
<p>車站詐案。層出不窮。前有某婦人携二行囊枯坐待車。忽一人來就坐其側。未幾。謂婦人曰。暫去即來。行囊請代看守。婦温應之。旋果有一衣類似服裝者來。匆匆取行篋而去。婦亦不以爲意乃片刻原主返。驚問物件何在。即扭婦勒令賠償。婦大駭。飲泣不已。經魯仲連出而調解。卒由婦出洋十元了事。實則先後三人。皆一黨也。故佈疑陣。使鄉愚入陷穽。計亦狡哉。</p>
<p>宋案發生時。子彈横飛。迄今大廳内猶多遺蹟。巨柱洞穿頗多。槍孔迄未修復。旅客入站。必至柱摩挲片刻。想見當日情狀。猶爲股慄不已。宋之能脫險。亦天佑哉。</p>
<h3>記杜麗雲及其唱片</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>近年以來。梨園界生氣蓬勃。由靜寂而復歸約爛。另有梅程荀尙。女有黄（雪艶琴）王（新艶秋）杜（麗雲）章（遏雲）。爭妍　艶。各有其相當之聲勢。而好事者復爲之推波助浪。組黨立社。彼此爭競。迄無已時。此固戲劇發揚光大之好消息。抑亦國家歌舞承平之好現象也。</p>
<p>上述梅程荀尙黄王杜章八人。大多爲燕趙人物。惟杜麗雲一人則爲南朝金粉。以南人而能馳譽於戲劇發源之北地。其魄力之雄偉。誠足使人驚偑。其藝術之優秀。蓋亦可想而知矣。至麗雲之所以成名。其原因有三。一資質聰慧。二好學不倦。三天賦充厚。然舍此三者之外。其主要原因。實得力於王瑤卿之循循善誘。好材料經過一番琢磨。自是不同凡品。　云。名師出高徒。洵然。</p>
<p>麗雲之名旣成。各唱片公司皆挽人丐其灌片。今年蓓開公司赴平收音。亦灌有佳奏三片。所唱之戲。當時皆由乃師瑤卿點選。計玉堂春探監二黄快三眼一面。除肉刑西皮快板搖板一面鞭蓉劍二黄倒板　龍慢板一面又快三眼一面貂蟬西皮原板一面。又南綁子一面。結構之精。腔調之佳。俱在第一次所灌者之上。可知點戲一項。實亦爲唱片事業重要工作之一也。麗雲新片。先發行（鞭蓉劍）及（玉堂春探監除肉刑）二片貂蟬一片。須俟年底方可行世云。</p>
<p>芙蓉劍爲麗雲之獨有劇。脚本爲瑤卿所編。蓓開所灌之快三眼。其格局與程禦霜之駡殿極相類似。玉堂春探監一段。從未有人注意及之。此次居然爲蓓開選獲。不可謂非一小小之幸運。</p>
<p>短訊　前日申園宴請新聞界於虹口酒樓。餐後由林視三君特備汽車。偕往該園。試放廣東舞台上烟花熖火。一時砰訇之聲。不絶於耳。有高入雲霄者。有盤旋而上者。或夭矯似流星。或纍纍若貫珠。或乘機車。或跨駿馬。手持烟花。露身扮演各種飛舞及仕林祭塔等。離奇變幻。五光十色。蔚爲奇觀。來賓皆大激賞。嘆爲觀止。尙有花色多種。未及施放。時已十一點餘。賓主盡歡而散。（初）</p>
<h3>印度遊記（八九）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>印度爲世界之奇國。計若有盤費者來此。以半年學語言。再能通英語。可以二三人結伴。以二年工夫周遊其各省。探佛跡及風俗。必大有所貢獻于社會。吾國人資本家但知數錢。軍閥動稱下野出洋。不知逃往日本乃是帝國。遠赴歐美徒長奢侈。走入俄國又嫌赤化。我以爲最好以後軍閥下野。不如遊印度光臀大仙學長生不老之法。或另換一新生活地。甘地尙不澈底。只半光蛋。非眞光蛋。此大仙眞成光臀猴也。惟身上尙未長毛。余眞見眞仙矣</p>
<p>余旣有缘參見第一高山大仙。回過沙彌神信園中。談論此事。神信笑曰。君不能耳。君能將衣服脫光。到吾恒河邊坐數月。吾等即可參謁君。并爲君宣傳曰。此中國大仙。久居满洲山中若干年矣。彼時男女香花供養即至。花圈加諸君之頸。布施捐欵者亦來。甚易之也。余笑曰。余病未能也。噫。歐洲中國。信仰有槍之英雄。而印人信仰光臀猴。名爲仙佛。意者印人得救。終于仙佛乎。一學生名古巴去告余。此乃第一大仙。十餘年一意接神。止服牛乳。各地貴人名人。均敬禮之。專爲此大典請來者也。其名號與昔時稱佛者等。與今稱甘地者亦同。但印人並不重視佛。即小學生亦然。余曰。印度何不改名佛國。彼不願。曰吾國之仙佛多矣。不能稱佛國以减少我之價值。因佛不過一果。而印度乃其樹也。蓋印人之自大也。如此。一小學生尙然。何况其他乎。</p>
<p>余過一廟。人告我曰。此猴廟也。余問其故。答曰。此廟本爲神廟。而羣猴常止其中。西人遂稱之爲猴廟矣。余問印度多猴乎。曰然。曰何地最多。曰近德利地方。（英總督所住）向西。爲余所住之省。多猴。以數百計。余喜研究動物社會學。乃問其詳。答曰。猴亦有兩種生活。有市猴。有鄉猴。鄉猴不入市。市猴不下鄉。各安其居。樂其業。人若過猴境不犯彼。彼亦相安。若犯其一。則圍而攻入。羣力甚大。有時彼來作惡劇。以　人。將人之鞋帽攫去。要求糖食。與之食。即送還本處。余問猴不食肉乎。曰否。猴素食動物也。曰猴羣不相聞乎。曰甚相安也。但前一博物敎授告余雄猴殺雌猴事。想亦偶然。猴性亦不平等。大體上猴較他動物爲馴良也。</p>
<h3>湖樓詩話（下）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>第四首當取跨虹橋外水迢迢。山色空濛月似潮。按跨虹橋爲蘇堤自南至北之第六橋。橋裏湖面已窄。環湖皆山。惟橋外則水接天。一望無際。故用迢迢二字。頗爲切當。呼起下文潮字。尤見形容雋妙。而山色空濛四字。亦頗渾成。互有關鍵。不落空泛。第三四句則取獨坐彈誰與共。水紅簾底一聲簫。或作海紅簾底一聲簫。但襲定菴之　起海紅簾底月。四廂花氣怒如潮。殊與簫字無關。且海紅即海棠也。李德裕花木記云。凡花木名海者。皆從海外來。如海棠之類是矣。定菴原句。本與花字相應。並非顏色。單獨取海紅簾底四字。終嫌欠缺。紅簾二字。本曾鞏南湖行。紅簾彩舫觀者多。美人坐上揚靑蛾。但船簾小於常制。則援小紅樓之例。正不妨冠以小字。却巧亦爲人名。與簫字扣合。而獨坐彈琴誰與共。則均取裁於唐诗。且翻去獨字。寫出兩人共坐一船。一則趺坐船頭。作側耳彈琴狀。一則從侍窗舷。作擁髻吹簫狀。其情景如畫。洵足面耐人尋味。以視他作誰是伴誰作伴之孤悽境狀。誠不可與同日語矣。别作有云。獨坐心情誰說破。水晶簾底一聲他。獨坐無聊誰伴我乍聞簾底一聲卿。獨坐書窗誰共語。夜明簾底一聲鷄。以書窗預伏鷄字以彩蘭雜志。所謂鷄林夜明簾。炳於白日。襯出鷄聲。亦頗見其巧思。獨惜上二句殊難得其稱耳。又有作獨坐禪床誰喚醒。却簾底一聲鐘。按杜陽雜編。却寒簾爲鳥骨所爲。當非禪床所有。似亦不稱。又作獨坐　軒誰解語。鸚哥簾底一聲茶。亦頗可取。但不免艱滞耳。</p>
<p>上列各句。大同小異者不勝臚舉。限於篇幅。恕不列榜。凡承投稿諸君。一律備贈薄采。但來函封套。已多脫離。不明所在。兹擬辦法如左。</p>
<p>一。贈口可請於家庭工業社無敵牌出品中。任意選擇。但照定價寄下半數。即當照奉。其限度。當以原作所塡被選雙圈之字數爲準。即每一字作定價一元論。例如被選十字者得取定價十元之物品。但寄半價五元可也。我寡準此。</p>
<p>二。前項贈品。槪由上海梅雪路無敵牌總廠代發。以免輾失誤。但請摘示原作。每一首之第一句。以資查對。截至雙十節爲止。逾期無效。因對工業社之找價須由鄙入補價不能不有一結束期也。</p>
<p>三。便於郵寄之物品甚多。當於廣告欄排日披露之。</p>

<p>形勢複雜廿兩迴顧上週間標金趨勢堅挺、惟形勢複亂、時風時雨、不可抑遏、日有五六兩至十餘兩曲折、習以爲常、莫可措手、蓋以國外消息紛歧、惟英美銀市均已報漲、然無大去化、滬市匯票亦鬆、計先令共長半檔、而金業中有所結進、以抵空頭、但金市適得其反、洵爲某銀行努力購買、而且吸收現貨、不遺餘力、將運出洋、約共一萬多條之巨、以致人心激昂也、自週初開盤僅爲七十五兩、即已衝出七百九十兩關、計達九十五兩半、乃最近之新高峰也、旋後成盤旋之局、迨週末破進八十兩、猝爲七十六兩、此週中有二十兩○五錢迴顧、統核尙漲一兩、至於照日滙揭價、計撳三十餘兩、而現貨赤條因天津帮不再採辦、復有轉售等情、間有以套期標、然價因有某銀行從事收羅、現下存底不過一萬數千條、故價尙能站住、照標金遞加八九兩、殆金市前途恐仍有盤旋不遑之勢、兹將此週經過概况、摘錄于后、</p>
<p>銀行吸現迭現高峰自週一八月十七日、大條及銀價均無升縮、至匯市亦無變化、而内部略緊、同業扒多塞少、殆十月份標金初開即降、爲七百七十五兩、因上週六大條看縮未果所致、旋後大户吳某抵空、更由中央銀行猛進、致價直衝靑雲、步趨甚捷、午時達九十二兩、收市九十兩、下午似見回挫、乃滙市稍鬆、僅計八十七兩一錢、收市八十七兩八錢、比前週末尙漲九兩三錢、前後市共有十七兩之差次、各號交易、統計求過於供、次日大條勿更、先令已縮半檔、惟内盤略鬆、至金市初開平平、計八十八兩、次爲七兩半、惟因美銀見跌、又聞美國倒閉銀行多家、故人心激動、當漲爲九十五兩半、以後買方趁勇、銳落八兩餘、午收計八十六兩六錢、下午猝爲八十三兩半、收市八十四兩半、比上日回小三兩三錢、終日計有十二兩迴旋、週三大條回長○六二五、銀價長一二五、先令掛長半檔、而内盤亦稍鬆動、同業中有所抛出、至標金開盤即降爲八十二兩、繼聞德國買進銀子、以鑄銀幣、故人心向下、僅爲七十九兩半、復爲八十六兩、乃滙豐吃先令六二五至六八七五、但賣方不絶、退爲八十兩○六錢、午收八十三兩半、政进大連帮脫售、並以大連票報小、靑島又有日人吵擾等事、故收市卒爲八十一兩一錢、比上日計小去三兩四錢、終日有六兩半上落、至翌日大條及先令等均均變更、惟銀行内盤見挺、業中扒結不怠、標金即開高盤、爲八十五兩半、因聞墨西哥賣出銀子、且美滙亦小、旋後漲爲九十兩、詎大户吳某等出售僅降爲八十五兩、復以先令似好、又加上四兩零、下午初萎爲七兩一錢、嗣後某銀行落手買進、遂漲爲九十兩○六錢、至收市八十九兩六錢、回漲八兩半、惟終日不過五兩六錢曲折、週五大條勿更、先令如故、金市開盤即小爲八十八兩半、供多求少、以後步降七兩、僅計八十一兩七錢、午刻八十四兩、下午已破八十兩内、計七十八兩八錢、乃先令内盤甚絀、收市七十八兩九錢、比上日狂降十兩○七錢、終日亦有十兩上下、元康祥代福興永王某傾售三千餘條、週六大條長一二五、美銀亦升一二五、先令随長半檔、内部平平、業中有所抛出至金市開盤略加一兩六錢、爲八十兩○五錢、繼爲八十三兩、復以賣多、卒爲七十六兩、忽聞某銀行裝運現金消息、人心一振、又加至八十一兩半、但人心平平、收市七十九兩半、比上日只加六錢、半間日間計七兩迴旋、惟形勢潛軟、宏利等曾有多頭脫手而某銀行稍進、兹將英美印銀市及匯票標金高低價、分述于后、</p>

<h3>美銀勿動匯兌見降</h3>

<h3>銀根步步轉緊</h3>
<p>昨星期日、銀行休業、故金融氣象淸淡殊恒、市場中洋釐市價大都疲滞、早午兩市同爲七錢二分五厘一毫二忽半、銀拆早市一錢六分、午市一錢七分、較前日又昂一二分、做出洋欵交易、早市匯劃票欵四十萬○五千、午市五十七萬、鈔票兩市均無交易、惟塲外鈔票、祇早市三萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百七十餘萬、銀公單收解三千八百餘萬、各路匯欵收解五十餘萬、同行拆票七百八九十萬、小錢莊交易三十餘萬、江南小洋早市爲六錢五分三釐半、午市爲六錢五分一釐半、兩市間差落二厘、做出交易早市六千角、午市二千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢四分五釐三毫七忽半、午市爲六錢四分五厘八毫七忽半、做出交易早市九萬五千角、午市四萬角、銅元仍爲三百七十五千、交易二萬八千餘串、</p>
<p>證劵上週債價益堅</p>
<p>全週上落極微…成交八千餘萬</p>
<p>上星期本埠證券市場各債市况、期市平平如前、賣買人氣、頗形閒散、除統筗較前稍旺、二○關與前彷彿外、其他均不及前、觀全週每日成交經過、週二達一千九百五十餘萬、週初一日僅一千四百五十萬、餘均沉靜、平均僅在一千一百萬元左右、成交總數八千萬零八萬元、較前星期增三百數十萬元、中統稅佔三千零十六萬、分八月期一千五百三十七萬、九月期一千四百七十九萬、二○關一千八百六十三萬五千元、分八月期一千一百四十二萬五千元、九月期七百二十一萬元、餘如二○捲分八月期四百九十九萬五千元、九月期二百三十八萬元、一九關計八月期四百三十萬、九月期二百十八萬五千元、一九善八月期三百七十二萬、九月期二百四十一萬元、裁兵八月期二百七十八萬五千元、九月期一百六十六萬元、編遣八月期二百四十萬、九月期八十七萬五千元、又整六共一百三十三萬五千元、九六公債一百十四萬五千元、關稅九十二萬五千元、七年二萬五千元、金融長期十四萬五千元現市極寥落、全週僅成交三萬零四百元、内惟裁兵佔一萬四千、其他祇數千元、至言上星期内各債價之趨勢、則爲時局形勢沉靜、債市環象、無稍變化、且時已下旬、距交割期亦漸近、故賣買觀望、市場交易零星、市况閒散、求供形勢均衡、市價上落閱平和、蓋各債券祇随市上一時之求供情形以爲轉移、甚少其他重要原因、足以左右市面也、故價雖間有變動、而忽漲忽跌、趨勢異常混亂、但爲零户需要猶不寂寞、故仍得維持其堅定狀態、結果較前星期均續稍漲、但爲數咸祇在四五角左右、惟二○捲九六期貨略小角許、一九關大票及裁兵現貨則漲近二元、債市情形、一時難有漲落云、兹將上週間各債價高低漲跌統計列後、（單位元）</p>

<p>紗花上週紗市平穩之態</p>
<p>紗市在上週間依然平澹、毫無振作氣象、以世界棉業狀况異常悲觀、致人心恐怖、投機家一致抛出、但有一廠商多頭視市上實需發達、滇蜀兩帮購辦粗紗交易尙稱熱閙、且本月份價與市上現貨售價較廉、故在本月大批買進、有收貨之意遠月亦被其带漲、惟某巨商鑒於大勢不良、而原料鬆動、仍無意扒補、惟將本月份了結、進近出遠、總之世界情形惡化、前途未許樂觀、不過現貨銷路較爲起色、因此紗市軟中带硬、暫能維持標紗各月價比前週本月份漲一兩七八錢、遠月微漲三四錢、成交統計一萬五千二百六十包同行中進二千一百二十包、行情平平、大阪三品紗比前週跌三四元、兹將各帮口買去之包額、分誌於後、</p>

<h3>上棉市蕭索</h3>
<p>現銷被外棉侵佔殆盡</p>
<p>棉市在週初尙平靜、因同業多數觀看、以漢口水災劇烈、棉田淹没者較衆、傾向做多、嗣以美印兩棉又轉跌風、而匯兌虚弱、市上外商各洋行競售劇烈、價格尙可特别遷就、然各廠商鑒於國外之過剩、使人寒慄、而不收嘗試、市盤又急轉直下、且有數廠購進廉價之外棉、套賣標花、約有十餘萬擔、此種情形、爲歷年所罕見、然本埠棉高價格已低、在此三十三兩之花、值得一拖、所有世界狀况、一概不論、市勢带緊一步、然美棉魯米特令恒豐廠進價祇三十三兩七錢五、此貨大概可紡細紗、所以照大勢測之、標棉前途、仍難樂觀也、又前日倒閉之某洋行買辦、有九千件白洛去翁默拉平果爾花、扯價三十一兩七錢五、悉數售於永安紗廠矣、在此一週中、本棉交易絶跡、惟外棉價值旣廉、品質又良、時時做開、標花各月價比前週跌三四錢、成交數統計五十四萬零五百擔、來源姚花一千包、美棉比前週跌二三十磅音、兹將各廠買進外棉價格及包額、分誌於後、</p>

<h3>調劑美棉需給之困難</h3>
<p>世界經濟不景氣…美棉需要量漸減</p>
<p>第一次估計激增…滾存量預計益大</p>
<p>日報前評美棉豐收情形、兹迻澤如下、美國農部發表第一次新棉估計爲一千五百五十八萬四千包、與前年實收量比較尙增一百六十五萬二千包十日之世界棉花市塲因是慘落紐約現貨跌至七分内、先是美國政府以棉花生產調節及防止價值低落之故、曾勸告農家減去棉田二成、然實際新棉栽培面積爲四千一百四十九萬一千畝、不過僅少一成、且以播種後天氣順適、棉作甚佳、棉田廢棄者僅百之分三、故估計實收棉田有四千零十二萬九千畝、一均每畝收量實達一百八十五磅又十分之八、與過去十年間平均每畝一百五十一磅又十分之四比較、實爲豐收、即比之一九二六年二百八十二磅又十分之六、尙增三磅以上、可知本年豐收之程度矣、</p>
<p>今美政府之棉花生產限止方策、遂因估計稀有之豐收、已告失敗、則新棉花年度（自本年八月至明年七月終）之需給、仍不免過剩、世界美棉之需要量、亦隨不景氣之深刻化、趨向減少、本年七月底上年度之需用量、仍爲一千一百二十萬包、比之前年之一千三百萬包、再前年之一千五百餘萬包、已見逐年減削、故本年七月終世界美棉之滾存量、達九百餘萬包之多、再加入本年度新棉一千五百五十餘萬包、然觀世界之經濟界、依然衰落、棉花消費量難以增加、設其消費量與前年用量同、則至明年七月底有一千三百餘萬包之滾存量、約等於一年間生產之供給過剩、除非今後天氣惡化使收獲減少、或世界棉業復興、而需要增加、恐需給之調劑、終無希望矣、</p>
<h3>美英印棉一致續漲</h3>

<p>新閘到頭有限、市銷奇靜、常錫北粳逐步猛跌五角之多、崑山厚粳跌勢益熾、須小三角、南港·靑角·石浦等薄稻、到貨已覺稍稀、故去胃雖仍呆、行情高定次疲、蘆洋尖及埠尖四鄉走銷微動、價格續低、</p>
<p>糖市粗砂白劃盤趨跌</p>
<p>昨糖市產區電訊、因值星期無來電、公會市塲劃盤、交易均皆岑寂、荷糖二十四號粗砂白高貨十一兩六錢、陳貨十一兩五錢至四錢半、高低不一、趨勢殊弱、二十號中砂白十一兩一、要手不多、高貨十一兩三錢、略有成交、市象平而不奇、生砂赤十兩零三錢、碗靑八兩七錢半、趨勢較挺、太古車糖自廠盤開後人氣轉平、價格因以趨落、B嘜十二兩一錢、陳貨兜十一兩零五分、DY嘜十一兩九錢、均少問津、HM嘜十兩四錢半H嘜十兩零八錢半、需要略見活躍、市形亦均平而乏神云、</p>

<p>開脫歇農把咖啡在濾器上濾凈、她同住的伴侶海倫利史德、還在睡中未醒、這一天是輪到開脫做早飯、她們兩人同在合組屋的起居室裏進膳、其餘的房屋爲臥室一間、裏面有兩隻榻、浴室一間、碗橱裝在墙壁裏、用作爲小厨房、這個合組屋位在村中、靠着盤克街、像這樣的一宅住所、兩個女郎每月要付八十元的房金、</p>
<p>開脫身上穿着便服、把餘剩的早餐放在桌上、有鮮橘汁·小麥片·烘　包等各種食物、然後去呌醒海倫、海倫带着睡容走入起居室、</p>
<p>啊、開脫、咖啡的味道眞不錯、我好像入睡不到一分鐘、這眞奇了、</p>
<p>難道我們要你醒着、祇因那些孩子們要歌唱罷哩、</p>
<p>這些事我眞的多不在意、我於九點鐘有約、必要趕緊哩、如果我能將保險單賣給那婦人、開脫就有一星期的好日子了、</p>
<p>開脫是保險掮客、她每星期的收入平均在六十五元左右、她向成功的職業婦女們兜售人壽保險、她有一種特殊的經騐、她發現這種婦女、無論已婚或是獨身、都有經　上的依靠、</p>

<p>開始一年、開脫祇能將就糊口到了現在她的進益就很可觀了、而還可以繼續上進、有一件事她很覺爲難、她每天的工作可以隨着自已的心思、很長久或是很短暫、所以很容易受到一種誘惑、像早上睡得很遲方始起身、到家裏緩緩的進膳、或者四點鐘就停止工作、進食之前任意看書等種種惡習、她律身很嚴、每天要做足八小時的工作、因爲這個緣故、她較了許多不做整天工作的女律師、成功的程度加增不少、</p>

<p>你對於這種銷售工作、感到厭倦麽、婦人問着、</p>
<p>不、開脫回答道、如果我覺着厭倦了、我就要做别的事情、我知道我有一些東西爲人家所需要的、所以我就讓他們自已去銷售、我從來不勉强人家的、這些都是眞話、</p>

<p>開脫因爲自已的進益並没有規定的數目、所以稍爲積蓄一些錢、可是這件事很難實行、她常想做個預算表、但是覺得旣費時間又耗精力、因此她常照舊例做去、海偏管着家用的賬、每種開支她們兩人平均攤分、</p>
<p>飯後、開脫又去訪了一個買主、然後回到辦公室做了兩小時的必要工作、她與其他銷售員互相談話、並將一天經過報告於經理、到了四點半鐘、她便登程回家了、她肉體上感覺倦疲、但是心靈上却是興奮、她的工作常在户外、無形中得到練習身體的機會、她在家裏吃了一杯茶、穿着便服休息、有一個豐富收入的職務、和舒適的家庭、身體上得益誠非淺鮮、</p>

<h3>Wuhan River Water Slightly Recedes</h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Communities Initiate Separate Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Liu Ruiheng Returned to Beijing by Steamer Yesterday</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river water receded slightly by several points on the 23rd, but it may still take some time for it to fully recede. It is said that He Chengjun has reduced his meals because of this. Wuhan has also simultaneously banned slaughter. The people have also voluntarily set up altars to pray for divine intervention. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The military headquarters convened a conference with Chinese and foreign representatives on the 23rd, deciding that Chinese and foreign communities would initiate separate relief efforts to aid disaster victims. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Ruiheng only boarded a steamer to return to Beijing on the evening of the 23rd. Before leaving, he told reporters that the flooding in Hubei and Hankou was more severe than in any other province or city. After reporting to the central government, he will request special relief efforts. The emergency relief association will divide the affected counties into disaster areas and send personnel to investigate. Furthermore, a shelter capable of accommodating 100,000 people will be built in Hongshan to house disaster victims. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water level remained unchanged on the 22nd. According to private observations by customs officials, it is feared that the water will not recede within a short period. There are no places of refuge left in the city. The water is deep enough to submerge people. There are few pedestrians, and transportation relies solely on boats. Shops, except those selling essential goods, have suspended business. Public and private losses are incalculable. Ships and ferries to Shanghai are extremely crowded. Public security and traffic inside and outside Hankou are maintained separately by the risk prevention department, the garrison headquarters, and the fortress, ensuring safety. Disaster victims from outside are refused entry into Wuhan. The provincial government has dispatched personnel, together with representatives from various counties, to provide local relief and assistance. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water in the city has not increased or decreased in recent days, remaining the color of iron filings and stagnant. Building foundations are gradually becoming unstable, especially in the Chinese Street area, where houses have been submerged for nearly a month since the end of last month, and civilian houses have been collapsing one after another. Last night, a corner of Xinlianbao Li, the most prosperous red-light district, collapsed, causing numerous casualties among the prostitutes. People are increasingly panicking. Some groups disobey the orders of government officials, while others who refuse to be conscripted for boat services by the military police are summarily shot. The tragedy is unprecedented. Due to strict security, the Japanese concession is still able to maintain order. Only two fires have occurred since the flooding. However, rumors are rampant, and foreign residents are uneasy. (23rd Reuter Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chiang Orders Vessels Along the River</p>
<h3>To Transport Wuhan Flood Victims</h3>
<p>Flood Relief Association to Move to Beijing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As he was about to leave, Chiang Kai-shek, considering the severe flooding in Wuhan and the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims, ordered vessels along the river to proceed to Wuhan to load flood victims and transport them to various places to seek sustenance. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to British sources, there are over 30 million flood victims along the river this time. While the water has not receded, things remain relatively calm. However, after the water recedes, the flood victims will inevitably resort to desperate measures to secure food and clothing, and a serious situation will arise. Dispersing the flood victims and helping them find food in different places is a better solution. However, the number of people actually transported is very limited. All countries are deeply concerned about the disaster and plan to launch a joint international relief effort. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Flood Relief Association will move from Shanghai to Beijing and operate in the National Government offices. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Amount of Relief Bonds</h3>
<p>To Be Decided by the Next State Council Meeting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the proposal to change the relief bonds from 10 million to 50 million, Finance Vice-Minister Li Tiaosheng has telegraphed Song Ziwen, reporting the proceedings of the Legislative Yuan meeting and requesting instructions on designating collateral. The State Council meeting on the 25th of the Administrative Yuan is scheduled to discuss this matter. Once the amount is decided, the Finance and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan will hold a joint meeting that afternoon to review the bond regulations and the principal and interest repayment schedule, so that a special session can be convened on the morning of the 26th to discuss the matter, in order to resolve it quickly. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wu Guozhen Arrives in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Report on the Flood Situation in Hubei Province</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Guozhen, Director of the Hubei Finance Department, arrived in Beijing on the 23rd to report to the central government on the flood situation in the province, and to consult with Yu Youren on post-disaster relief efforts in Hubei. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Emperor Sends Condolences for Flood</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Emperor has donated money to provide relief for the Hankou flood. The donation will be delivered by the Imperial Household Ministry to the Foreign Ministry on the 24th for forwarding to China. The Emperor will personally telegraph Chairman Chiang on the 24th to express his condolences for the flood. (23rd Reuter Dispatch)</p>
<h3>U.S. Wheat Loan to China</h3>
<p>Three Points Awaiting Discussion</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the U.S. loan of wheat to relieve the flood in our country, the Flood Relief Association attaches great importance to this matter and has already made informal contact. Currently, the following matters are awaiting discussion: (1) the repayment period, (2) transportation issues, and (3) valuation issues. It is said that after our side formally agrees, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will convene relevant parties to concretely resolve the above issues and formally notify our country. Both sides will proceed under the name of their respective governments, assuming responsibility. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sudden Rise in Water Level in Northern Canal</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The water level in the Northern Canal has risen sharply, with the water surface being only two</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>feet from the dike. It continues to rise, creating a very dangerous situation. The Canal Affairs Bureau is supervising laborers to urgently build earthen embankments on the north bank of Yangliuqing. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Flood Reported in Southern Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Breach in Upper Reaches of Han River</p>
<p>(Beiping) A breach occurred in the upper reaches of the Han River in southern Shaanxi. More than ten counties along the river, including Shiquan, Zhenping, Lan'gao, Ziyang, Pingli, Baihe, and Zhenba, have been turned into marshes. Houses have been washed away, and countless people and livestock have drowned. The water level continues to rise. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Reports from</p>
<h3>Lu Province on Declining Water Levels</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Canal Affairs Bureau received reports of declining water levels from various locations today. At Lijingtun in the upper reaches, the water level dropped by six inches on the 20th, with a water level of 17 zhang, 3 chi, 8 cun. At Sunlou, it dropped by 1 chi, 1 cun, and then by another 1 chi, 6 cun on the 21st, with a water level of 14 zhang, 3 chi, 4 cun. At Xiaoluzhuang in the middle reaches, the water level dropped by 9 cun on the evening of the 21st, with a water level of 9 zhang, 1 chi, 4 cun. At Guanzhuang, it dropped by 1 chi in the morning of the 21st, and then by another 1 chi, 2 cun in the evening, with a water level of 10 zhang, 6 chi, 7 cun. At Luokou, it dropped by 1 chi today, with a water level of 9 zhang, 0 chi, 2 cun. At Dongguandong in the lower reaches, the water level dropped by 6 cun on the evening of the 21st, with a water level of 7 zhang, 9 chi, 7 cun. At Sunjia, it dropped by 1 cun in the evening, with a water level of 4 zhang, 4 chi, 4 cun. According to those familiar with river engineering, Shaanxi Prefecture is about 800 li from the upper boundary of the Shandong section. With a high flow rate of 3 meters per second, it travels 432 li per day, reaching Shandong in less than two days. From the upper boundary to Yanwo in the lower boundary, 860 li, it can exit Shandong in about two days. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) A telegram from Shaanxi Prefecture reported that the normal water level is the same as the highest level on the 17th. Water from above Shaanxi Prefecture is still flowing in continuously. In two or three days, the water level in Shandong Province may still rise to about 9 zhang, 3 chi. However, the current water flow is not strong, leaving room for emergency protection. If Shaanxi Prefecture does not rise further, there is no cause for concern this year. In three to five days, barring unforeseen circumstances, we will be confident. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Canal Affairs Bureau, arrived at Dingtao Chengpu last night, crossed the river this morning, and will arrive at Dongzhuang tonight. Tomorrow, he will inspect dangerous works such as Li Shengtun, Liuzhuang, and Zhukou. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yellow River at Li Shengtun and Sunlou dropped by 4 cun, with a water level of 14 zhang, 3 chi. At Luokou in the middle reaches, the water level dropped by 6 cun, with a water level 8 zhang, 9 chi, 2 cun above sea level, a drop of 3 chi, 8 cun from the highest water level this year. At Wangzaojia in the lower reaches, the water level dropped by 1 chi, 6 cun, with a water level of 6 zhang, 6 chi, 3 cun. However, there is heavy rain again today, and a northeast wind is blowing urgently, so the water will definitely rise again. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua Discusses</p>
<h3>Floods and Banditry in Henan Province</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Liu Zhenhua passed through Jinan by special train from Tianjin today on his way to Beijing. Important figures welcomed and saw him off at the station. Liu said he was going to Beijing to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to request instructions on the defense area of his troops. Currently, part of his troops are stationed in Luoyang, and the majority are stationed in Huaiqing. In the future, they will be transferred to Xinxiang. There are many bandits and robberies by the people in western Henan. Over 200,000 guns are held in more than 20 counties. The people cannot survive without colluding with bandits, leading to a blurring of the lines between civilians and bandits. The more bandits are recruited, the more there are. If it is not handled properly, it will become the second Jiangxi. The Luo River, Yi River, Qing River, and Dan River are all swollen, turning the banks into marshes. The Gongxian Arsenal has been flooded. Due to the prevalence of bandits in western Henan, one often does not see human habitation for hundreds of li. The grass inside villages is several feet deep. There are communists in several counties in southern Henan, and the number of drug addicts is also increasing. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liaoning Province</p>
<h3>Delegation Returning from Korea</h3>
<p>Talks About Investigation and Relief Efforts</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Wang Huayi, Wang Xiaoyin, and Lu Guangji, the delegation sent to Korea to comfort the afflicted overseas Chinese, returned to Shenyang on the 22nd. According to them, there were originally over 91,000 overseas Chinese in the entire territory, and nearly 50,000 have been forced to return to China. The past incidents of harm have been thoroughly investigated, with a confirmed count of 140 deaths, 118 serious injuries, and over 2.9 million yuan in property losses. They brought 11,000 yen in relief funds, allotting 40 yuan to each family of the deceased and 25 yuan for the care of the injured, totaling 8,550 yuan. This was handed over to the consulate to be passed on to the Chinese chambers of commerce in various ports for distribution. The remaining 2,450 yuan was left to the chambers of commerce for repatriating refugees and providing relief to the unemployed. Death and loss were most severe in Pingan. There is no hope for the restoration of commerce in the short term. There is also no consulate in the area, and the consul stationed in Zhennampo concurrently handles affairs, which is a great distance away, resulting in inadequate protection. The overseas Chinese are eagerly awaiting the establishment of a consulate. On the evening of the 20th, Japanese citizens in Seoul, Incheon, and Pyongyang released special editions regarding the Qingdao incident, fabricating their accounts. There were also rumors of an attack on the Seoul consulate on the 21st. After Zhang Weicheng requested sanctions from the Korean Governor-General, the overseas Chinese were fearful. Only about 60 households remained in Seoul. The delegates went to Incheon on the 20th and returned to Jingcheng Beima, passing through Pyongyang to pay respects at the mass graves of the overseas Chinese and comfort those who were still recovering from serious injuries. More than ten Korean leaders came to visit, expressing their regret and saying that they would strive to prevent Koreans from being incited and to atone for their past mistakes.

<p>Japanese Diet Member Ryoichi Kikuchi</p>
<h3>Spoke at Length with Chiang Kai-shek Recently</h3>
<p>Chiang Hopes for a Great Yellow Race Union</p>
<p>Kikuchi Requests an End to the Anti-Japanese Movement</p>
<p>National Government Officials Host Banquet</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ryoichi Kikuchi, a member of the Japanese Minseito party, met with Chiang Kai-shek at 9 p.m. on the 21st, speaking until 11 p.m. Kikuchi said that Chiang recognized that independent countries should advocate for the recovery of judicial rights in China. Chiang told Kikuchi that China and Japan should work together for the weak and small nations, hoping that Asian nations would form a great yellow race union. Kikuchi, who has long studied Islam, will soon go to Persia and India. Finally, Kikuchi requested Chiang to employ a dozen or so Japanese instructors and to end the anti-Japanese movement. He is willing to devote his life to the Three Principles of the People and China's recovery of its legal rights. Chiang agreed to all of this. Shao Yuanchong, Chen Lifu, and He Yaozu hosted Kikuchi at the International Club this afternoon, accompanied by Niu Yongjian, Wang Zhengting, and other central committee members. Kikuchi left Beijing for Shanghai this evening. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Protest on the Wanbaoshan Incident</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Delays Responding</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A foreign consul said that those responsible at the Japanese embassy have revealed the opinion that since the Wanbaoshan Incident was being negotiated by the commissioners of foreign affairs of the three eastern provinces, many of the documents have not been submitted to Beijing. The matter should continue to be handled by the commissioners in the north. Therefore, the government's protests have been delayed. The veracity of this remains to be confirmed. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhong Yu is directly negotiating the Wanbaoshan case with the Japanese consul. Zhong telegraphed that after the Japanese troops withdrew, more than two thousand Korean farmers were still in Wanbaoshan and had not withdrawn. Although they have stopped farming, the civilian land in Wanbaoshan rented by the Koreans may cause future problems because the tenancy has not been officially terminated. Zhong is currently in Harbin, quietly awaiting the Japanese response before resuming negotiations. Our side's intention is to handle the matter in two parts. The local nature will be negotiated by Zhong Yu with the Japanese consul stationed in Jilin. The incident of Japanese police entering the interior and shooting and killing farmers is not of a local nature and has been communicated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Japanese envoy, Shighemitsu, but to date, the Japanese side has not yet responded.

<p>(Beiping) With the end of military affairs, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's headquarters needs to discuss post-war issues related to military supplies.

<h3>Fu Zuoyi Arrived in Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xu Yongchang and Others Arrived in Beiping via the Zhengtai Railway</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi arrived in Beiping at 3 pm this afternoon. He will meet with Zhang Xueliang soon to report everything. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi said that he was ordered to act as the chairman of Suiyuan Province, and he reported his assumption of office on the 20th. The secretary is temporarily replaced by Zeng Houdu. This time he came to Beiping to meet with the Deputy Commander to request instructions on all administrative policies, hoping to achieve a situation where officials are poor and the people are rich. The first item is to increase the people's interests, pay attention to suppressing bandits, and advocate for self-defense by the people. After the main canal of the people's livelihood canal is completed, four branch canals have been completed. There are currently two infantry divisions and two cavalry brigades in Suiyuan Province. On the way, I received a report from the cavalry brigade in Datong that 600 to 700 communists in Fuping had infiltrated Suiyuan Province, including 400 to 500 mutinous soldiers from Gao Guizi's unit and over 200 young people. They are very secretive and quick in commanding. I have telegraphed all armies to quickly eliminate them. Those who eliminate the bandits will be rewarded with 10,000 yuan. I fear that they will infiltrate northern Shaanxi, so I have telegraphed to seal up all the ships on the Yellow River, so that they can be completely eliminated in Suiyuan Province, avoiding future troubles in the north. Yan returned to Shanxi to visit his father's illness, and will go abroad after he recovers. Xu Yongchang and others originally planned to go to Datong and come to Beiping together, but due to the rain, they changed to take the Zhengtai Railway to Beiping today and will arrive in Beiping on the 24th.

<h3>Zhang Fang Arrived in Jinan from Beijing</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Zhang Fang arrived in Jinan from Beijing today. Li Shuchun, the director of the civil affairs hall, met him at the station. Zhang said that he originally wanted to go to Jiangxi to meet Chiang Kai-shek, but because he had already seen him in Beijing, he would not go. He came to discuss with Han about the matter of clearing and suppressing bandits and providing relief in Shandong and Henan, because northern Henan is in a bad state, and over 50 counties have been flooded, and the disaster victims are suffering. The rest of the troops are stationed near Nanyang, but they are too scattered, making it inconvenient to suppress bandits. Now that Han has gone to Beiping, I have decided to go to Beiping tomorrow to meet Han to discuss the matter and reminisce about old times. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qingdao Japanese National Essence Society</p>
<h3>Negotiation of Assault on Chinese</h3>
<p>To Be Peacefully Resolved Soon</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Regarding the incident of the Japanese National Essence Society members assaulting Chinese people, Hu Jiafeng, the secretary-general of the city government, and Hori Koichi, the acting Japanese consul-general, met formally at the International Club on the 23rd. Both sides expressed their willingness to resolve the matter peacefully. It is expected that the matter will be formally resolved when the Japanese Consul General Kawagoe returns to Qingdao from Japan on the 27th. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The city government has learned that members of the Japanese National Essence Society set out again en masse on the evening of the 19th to demonstrate and parade along Liaoning Road, deliberately insulting Chinese people they encountered, hoping to provoke animosity and expand the trend. Fortunately, the public saw through their scheme and avoided them. The city government, in addition to sending plainclothes detectives to patrol everywhere and secretly monitor them, all the police officers also paid special attention, and fortunately, no further incidents occurred. Currently, the city government is still afraid that some citizens may be motivated by righteous indignation to retaliate and has further strengthened prevention and guidance to avoid falling into their trap. According to the city government, the Japanese side should bear the responsibility for this case. There are three obvious points. This incident was caused by the Japanese Zhimao Yongwu, arousing public anger, which is beyond doubt. When the Chinese were viewing the garden, Zhimao should have reported to the Chinese and Japanese authorities to suppress the situation, but he did not do so, instead, he invited the notorious National Essence Society thugs, which led to this tragic incident. He is the one who should bear the responsibility for causing the incident. Secondly, the National Essence Society is a violent organization with a history of repeated violence. It is rumored that the members of the society had drunk heavily in the German-owned bakery beforehand, showing their intention to cause trouble. Moreover, they carried knives and sticks with them when they set out, showing that they were organized and planned. The Chinese, on the other hand, were unarmed. The injured individuals are of different ages, occupations, origins, and addresses, showing that they were neither organized nor planned. They are the ones who should bear the responsibility for causing the incident. Thirdly, according to the report of the German guard, Ying, on the injuries on both sides, ten Chinese people were injured, including three with minor injuries and seven with serious injuries. The cause of the injuries was all due to being cut by knives, and the wounds were mostly on the back and sides, indicating that they were injured because they could not avoid it. On the Japanese side, more than ten people were injured, most of which were minor skin injuries. It can be seen that the Chinese were injured because they could not avoid it, and the fact that the Japanese carried knives and sticks to chase the Chinese is undeniable. This is the third point for which the Japanese side should bear the responsibility for causing the incident. Therefore, the city government is now asking the Japanese consul to dissolve the society. As for the extent of the damage, it will be investigated and discussed later. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gu Renfa Discusses the Shanxi Situation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Renfa came to Beijing to find a solution for Yan Xishan. He said that Yan Xishan lives in Baifotang, focusing on his father's illness, so as not to create an opportunity for the communists. There are about 100,000 troops in Shanxi Province, including four armies, the road protection army, and the police garrison. The military pay is partly assisted by the central government and Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, but the amount is insufficient, so Shanxi Province has to raise its own funds. Shanxi's annual revenue is only over 17 million yuan, and education expenses account for 5 million. The value of Shanxi currency has plummeted, with each yuan only worth 3 jiao, and the total amount is 60 million. In the future, the provincial government plans to recover it, which requires 18 million in cash. More than 10 million yuan has already been recovered. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Shandong and Henan Clearing and Suppressing Plans</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Shandong-Henan Clearing and Suppression Supervisory Office has released a military plan for clearing and suppressing, and detailed rules for the implementation of clearing and suppressing. The plan takes the elimination of bandits, communists, and reactionaries in Shandong and Henan, and the strict implementation of political tutelage as the general outline. The bandit suppression troops are dispatched and commanded by the highest military officers of the two provinces. In areas with few bandits, the clearing and suppression bureau will supervise and urge the community police and the people to clear and suppress. The plan stipulates the bandit suppression policy and strictly prohibits false accusations, clearing, and indiscriminate burning of villages. According to Li Tian, the chief of the political affairs office, the detailed rules are based on the central government's clearing and suppression regulations, with slight differences: (1) Emphasizing clearing and suppressing, and eliminating the communist party and reactionaries. (2) Handling post-disaster relief and assistance, summoning refugees, restoring the neighborhoods, and moving towards local autonomy. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief and the Rise and Fall of the Nation</h3>
<p>When the flood disaster occurred in July, this newspaper wrote two commentaries, "The Calamity of Incessant Rain" and "Emergency Flood Relief," urgently appealing to arouse the attention of the government and the people. Subsequently, we wrote a series of commentaries on the flood disaster and the urgent issue of people's food, detailing the advantages and disadvantages and appealing for urgent relief and planning for the aftermath. The reporter initially believed that although the flood was devastating, it could be salvaged by human effort. We also believed that if emergency prevention and relief were implemented early, the disaster area would not expand, and the disaster situation would not reach such a severe level. However, day after day and week after week, reports of disasters and requests for relief telegrams flew in like snowflakes. Government disaster investigation officials began to depart slowly. Later, due to Chairman Xu of the Relief Committee's persistent efforts and appeals, and due to the compassion of the government authorities, they resolutely proposed the establishment of the National Government Flood Disaster Committee, the issuance of public bonds, and the dispatch of senior relief officials. Relief efforts began to take shape, but the disaster situation became increasingly severe.</p>
<p>We believe that the government has absolute power and ability, and it wields absolute force. The exertion of force depends on a shift in mindset. Although our country's treasury is difficult and the people's strength is depleted, what has sustained the precarious situation is the strength of this supposedly wealthy region. Now, Jiangnan and Hebei are a vast expanse of water. Banditry has not ended, and the water calamity follows. The poor and the rich alike are doomed. Even if the lives of these 50 million disaster victims are not worth cherishing, how will our country survive in the future? Therefore, if we do not provide relief, the people's survival cannot be guaranteed, and the country will have nothing to rely on. The survival of the nation and the people is at stake, and it is by no means comparable to ordinary disasters. This is what our government and people should clearly recognize.</p>
<p>Our neighbor, Japan, has tsunamis and earthquakes that are almost unavoidable periodic disasters. However, the people, with their perseverance and extraordinary spirit, struggle arduously against their fate every day. The Tokyo earthquake of 1923 turned everything into rubble. Today, on the rubble field, a more perfect and more splendid new Tokyo has been rebuilt and flaunted before the eyes of the world. This is proof of the new emerging national character of courage and determination, which is sufficient to revitalize the country. ("Stones from other hills can be used to polish jade.") Our nation, in order to survive and continue its life, can this kind of struggling national spirit be dispensed with? The way our nation expresses its struggling spirit is being watched by all, and it depends on the relief and reconstruction of this flood disaster.</p>
<p>At the funeral of Song's mother, Chairman Chiang traveled thousands of miles to Shanghai to offer condolences. Before his grief had subsided, he rushed to the bandit areas of Jiangxi, braving the sweltering heat and traveling arduously. His benevolence and filial piety are clearly evident to all. However, in this flood, the dead are exposed and the living are waiting to die. Hundreds of millions of people are suffering the same great calamity. The current situation is no less severe than the bandit troubles in Jiangxi, and the hidden dangers in the future may be even worse than the bandits in Jiangxi today. Respect the elderly as you would your own parents, and care for the young as you would your own children. We deeply hope that Chairman Chiang will expand his benevolence and filial piety and move his motorcade on a long journey through the sweltering heat to personally inspect Wuhan, the area most severely affected by the disaster, and devise ways to provide emergency relief and plan for the aftermath. This would be the fortune of the 50 million disaster victims, as well as the blessing for the future of our nation. The reporter is incapable of providing assistance. He can only earnestly express his sincere plea to those who have great power and ability with his clumsy pen.</p>

However, according to an official announcement, the British monarch, after returning to London last night, summoned Conservative leader Baldwin and Liberal leader Samuel at the request of Prime Minister MacDonald to inquire about the position of the two parties. After returning from Scotland, MacDonald entered Buckingham Palace and stayed for an hour. Subsequently, the monarch summoned Samuel to the palace at 12:30. Samuel and Lord Reading met with George this morning. George is now able to sit in an armchair. In the morning, Baldwin met with Neville Chamberlain and others at the Conservative Party headquarters. The Liberal Party (shadow cabinet) is scheduled to meet this afternoon. Reuters, London, 23rd - Will the current government continue in office and carry out its balanced budget or will it resign? This important decision may be made today. It seems beyond doubt that the government is willing to pursue its economic proposals with the support of the Conservative and Liberal parties, regardless of the opposition of the General Council of the Trade Unions Congress (TUC). The Conservative Party still believes the government's economic proposals are not sufficient. The cabinet has revised its proposals in an attempt to accommodate them, but it is difficult to say whether this will be effective. The cabinet does not usually meet on Sundays, except in extremely serious national affairs, such as a general strike or war. The cabinet's decision to meet on Sunday is also indicative of the seriousness of the situation and the government's difficulties.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - Following a cabinet meeting this afternoon, officials announced that the cabinet has formulated a plan to deal with</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>the current situation. The government and the opposition will continue to discuss it tomorrow. The cabinet will hear the results of the discussions tomorrow evening at 7:00 PM. Currently, not all cabinet members are confident that they can obtain the agreement of all parties. It is widely believed that if the government does not obtain the full support of the opposition parties, it will resign because the TUC remains persistent. Members of the TUC Administrative Council are currently staying in London in preparation for an emergency meeting. The TUC's Economic Committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to decide whether it is necessary to reconvene the Administrative Council before the TUC holds its general meeting in Bristol on September 7. In short, no matter what policy the government has, it cannot be implemented before Parliament meets. The TUC's general meeting will have ample time to consider the government's proposals in Bristol before the government submits its plan to Parliament. Conservative leader Baldwin returned from Paris today. When he arrived at Victoria Station, the audience cheered loudly, shouting, "Here is the savior of the country!" Tonight, Baldwin will meet with former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain. When reporters at the station asked for his opinion, Baldwin declined to discuss the political situation but said that he fully supports the policy adopted by his colleagues.</p>
<h3>Overview of British Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Memorandum Delivered to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - The British government recently submitted a memorandum to the League of Nations, explaining the equipment, personnel, and expenses of the British armed forces. The total military expenditure for the British Navy, Army, and Air Force is £108,000,000 per year, of which less than £50,000,000 is spent on the Navy. The above figures do not include pensions, and the troops provided by the colonial governments are not included in the report. The colonial armies have only a few thousand people. Overseas autonomous regions and India will report directly to the League of Nations. The British statement said that the figures in the memorandum have nothing to do with the British government's proposals to be submitted to the 1932 Disarmament Conference. The British memorandum does not contain any discussion of policy.</p>
<h3>Indian Governor-General Seeks to Break the Deadlock</h3>
<p>Invites Gandhi to Meet and Explain Misunderstandings</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 22nd - After returning to Simla from Calcutta, the first measure taken by the Indian Governor-General was to allow Gandhi to see him. Thus, the deadlock between the All-India Congress and the Indian government may be resolved, and the hope that Gandhi may go to London has now been revived. The Indian Governor-General sent a letter to Gandhi inviting him to meet in Simla to explain any misunderstandings. The two sides may meet in early next week. Sapru, who is currently traveling to London on the Moldavia ship, is still sending radio messages from time to time to Gandhi and the government, continuing to work to mediate. Gandhi told people that the Indian Governor-General has no intention of revoking the truce agreement. The All-India Congress cannot continue the struggle of non-violent resistance without the permission of the Working Committee.</p>

<h3>Hungarian New Cabinet Not Yet Formed</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - Hungarian Foreign Minister Count Károlyi has been unable to find talented people to head the ministries of finance and economy due to the lack of support from the National Party, and Károlyi is unwilling to act perfunctorily, so he has returned the mandate to form a cabinet. It is expected that the regent will order former Finance Minister Walkó to form a new cabinet without political color so that the country can overcome its political difficulties. Walkó is one of Hungary's veteran experts in finance. Károlyi had asked him to head the Ministry of Finance, but he declined due to disagreements over Károlyi's plan to reform finance.</p>

<p>International Red Cross Enthusiastic About Helping Chinese Disaster Relief</p>
<p>National News Agency, Minneapolis, 22nd - General Mills President Bell suggested to the Agricultural Relief Bureau today that when selling wheat to China for disaster relief and exchanging coffee with Brazil, it should be stipulated that American factories grind it into flour first and then ship it. American flour mills are only willing to charge the cost and do not seek profit, hoping that workers can get jobs.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 22nd - The International Red Cross and the League of Red Cross Societies Committee have appealed to Red Cross societies around the world on behalf of the disaster victims in Hankou and have made arrangements on behalf of the Chinese Red Cross to be responsible for the distribution of donations from other countries.</p>

<h3>The Flooding of the Three Towns of Wuhan</h3>
<p>The Number of Refugees Increases to Over 410,000</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief Association Establishes Relief Offices in Beijing and Shanghai</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Hankou City was flooded, and Wuchang was also cut off by water, yesterday Hanyang was also flooded. The three towns of Wuhan have no dry land left. The people are displaced, and those who hoped to survive have now become desperate. The devastation of the god of the Yellow River has reached this point, which is truly lamentable. Here is a continuation of the disclosure of the situation in recent days:</p>
<p>Breaches of the Dikes in Wuchang: Since the breach of the Wuqing Gate in Wuchang, the dikes in various places have not been very strong and have already shown signs of danger. However, they were able to be maintained due to the flooding of Hankou, which reduced the water volume. Recently, the water level has risen sharply, coupled with a slight relaxation in defenses. The dike on Chopsticks Street outside Hanyang Gate was the first to be breached by the water. The railway tracks at Xujiapeng Station were subsequently flooded. By the morning of the 19th, the Qingshan Dike, from Huangwuli to Zhanggongci, also collapsed for about a zhang (ten feet). At that time, the waves surged and poured into the city from the Shahu and Changchunguan areas. The water depth in various places such as Tongxiangmen and Caohumen was several feet deep in the flatlands, and almost everywhere was flooded except for Chang Street. However, the water in the ditches on Chang Street was rising, and the situation was also precarious. If Wangshan Gate breaks, it will immediately become a watery country. It is found that the Qingshan Dike extends for dozens of li (miles) from Wufeng Gate in the northeast of Wuchang to near Wutai Gate in the southwest of Wuchang, forming an arc and is indeed the protection of Wuchang. After the breach, the impact, in addition to pouring into the city, also had a horizontal breach, directly approaching Fankou through Shahu, Donghu, and Beihu. The dikes there are also the protection of seven counties, including Huanggang and Echeng. It is heard that they have also been breached. The number of disaster victims in the seven counties who have been buried in the stomachs of fish must not be small.</p>
<p>Dangerous Situation in Hankou: After the flooding of Hankou City for twenty days, the losses of the people are countless. Fortunately, the Zhanggong Dike has not yet been breached, and electricity and water can be supplied as usual. Unexpectedly, after the breach of the Huangjingtang Dike, the Xiang River directly approached the Zhanggong Dike, and its height was level with the dike. A part of it was in extreme danger. If it breaches again, the water level in Hankou City will increase by three feet, and the water plant of the water and electricity company will also lose its function. The impact on the lives of the disaster victims is even more significant. It is heard that the authorities have entrusted the responsibility of rescue to the Water Conservancy Bureau, dispatching workers to rush to the rescue, which may temporarily ensure safety. In addition, the most noteworthy things are the collapse of houses and electric shocks. The people are sacrificing their lives in large numbers. Because the houses have been soaked for too long, the foundations are dissolving, and they can collapse at any time. And the electric wires are mostly in the water, and electric current can occur at any time, which can be triggered immediately. The most tragic scene was the collapse of the Yingbin Hotel. This place is located at the intersection of Special Zone 3 and the Model Zone, where the water flow is turbulent. The first, second, and third floors are all full of disaster victims. At 12 o'clock on the evening of the 18th, the Yingbin Hotel building suddenly collapsed, completely crushing the nearby electric and telephone wires and pipes. The electric current was emitted in all directions, immediately burning twelve people to death. The number of people crushed to death is still unknown.</p>
<p>Disaster Situation in Hanyang: Hanyang, with the Xiang River on the left and the Yangtze River on the right, was already in extreme danger at this time of sudden rise in water levels. However, it is not a commercial port, and its prosperity is far from comparable to Hankou and Wuchang, so it has not received much attention. Recently, the Black Mountain Dike collapsed, and the dikes along the river also collapsed at the same time. By the 19th, the entire city had been breached by water. Residents have completely retreated to Turtle Mountain and Black Mountain, building straw sheds to shelter from the wind and rain. Those who are unable to do so will have members dispatched by the Emergency Relief Association, together with the Hanyang County Government, to build shelters for them. In two days, more than a thousand buildings have been built, resembling villages. When the water came, the people were too busy escaping to take care of their belongings, resulting in the complete submersion of the goods stored in various warehouses. The rice and salt factories suffered the greatest losses, and there was a shortage of daily necessities.</p>
<p>Increase in Disaster Victims: According to the previous investigation by the Emergency Relief Association, there were more than 220,000 disaster victims in the three towns of Wuhan. Now, they have been increasing successively. It is reported that there are more than 50,000 disaster victims in Wuchang, 200,000 disaster victims in Hankou, and more than 30,000 disaster victims in Hanyang. In addition, all the rickshaw pullers are unemployed, totaling more than 30,000 people, and more than 100,000 dock workers. The total is more than 410,000 people, all gathered in Hongshan, Yellow Crane Tower, Kai Zi Ying in Wuchang, Zhanggong Dike, railway in Hankou, and Turtle Mountain, Black Mountain in Hanyang. They are displaced and in dire straits, like the painting of Zheng Xia. As for the disaster victims in various counties, the authorities have issued orders to the county magistrates to provide on-site relief and not to come to the province. However, those who continue to flee here are still not few. The authorities, fearing that Red bandits may be mixed among them, will not allow them to land without strict inspection. Yesterday, thousands of refugees suddenly came to Wuchang and were refused to land.</p>
<p>Actively Raising Relief Funds: The Emergency Relief Association, considering that the disaster situation is extremely serious and the relief funds are insufficient for distribution, has not only telegraphed the Central National Government and Commander-in-Chief Chiang for relief, but also had He Chengjun write to the heads of various academies, requesting them to consider the disaster victims and provide effective relief. It was also decided at the tenth regular meeting to establish relief offices in Beijing and Shanghai, hiring Fang Ziqiao, Geng Bozhao, Peng Linjiu, Tang Zhongkui, Zhu Ziying, Xu Lanru, Xiao Renqiu, Liu Yuwang, and it is heard that Liu Xiaojie and others will be members of the Beijing office. Jiang Yuyan, Liu Wanqing, Li Ding'an, Wang Shaochang, Han Yongqing, Luo Buzhou, Ming Runsheng, Ma Shaoqing, Le Gutao, Chang Lechen, Xiao Shuzhi, Liu Shanfu, Yi Nanzhen, etc. will be members of the Shanghai office. They also requested that each person be sent back to Hubei to inspect the disaster situation on the ground. (August 21st)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu has gone to Beiping</h3>
<p>Chiang Po-cheng and others accompany him</p>
<p>His Wife and Sons go together</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Province Chairman Han Fuqu recently received a telegram from the Vice Commander, inviting him to discuss the aftermath of North China. Because of the reorganization of Shi Yousan's remnants, he was unable to go. Now that the reorganization of Shi's troops is basically completed, he has decided to go to Beiping. This morning, he ordered the Jinpu Railway Station to prepare a special train. At noon, he transported his luggage to the train. After 2 o'clock in the afternoon, Han, together with his wife Han Yizhen Ji Ganqing, and his sons and daughters, took a car to the Jinpu Station. Accompanying him were Cheng Xixian, Director of the Industry Department, Wang Fangting, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Zhang Shaotang, Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, and Military Education Regiment Leader Song Shiyan. Those who came to the station to see him off included Li Shuchun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Li Zongbi, Chief of Staff, Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Finance Department, Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, Provincial Committee Zhang Yue, Adjutant Han Wenxiu, and Wang Kairu, Director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. They had all arrived at the station earlier to wait. The special train had a total of fifteen cars, including two private cars and the rest were a mixture of third-class and棚cars. Two companies of guards were led by Jia Benjia, the leader of the First Regiment of the Pistol Brigade. After Han arrived at the station, he sent a car to meet Chiang Po-cheng, the Chief Counselor of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and invited him to go to Beiping together. Before leaving, Han told reporters that this trip to Beiping was at the invitation of the Vice Commander to discuss matters. He did not know what he would be discussing. He also took the opportunity to inquire about the Vice Commander's illness. The rest of his family lived in Beiping, so he took the opportunity to visit them. He would probably be back in about a week. He originally wanted to go to Henan to meet with Chairman Liu to discuss matters such as cleaning up the countryside and suppressing bandits in Lu and Yu, but now he must wait until he returns to Jinan from Beiping before he can decide. Cao Fulin, the commander of the 29th Division, has led his troops to Guantao to attack Liu Guitang's troops, and it will be resolved in a few days. At 3:15, the special train left the station and headed north. After Han left, military affairs were temporarily handed over to Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 20th Division (Sun came from Zhoucun last night). Political affairs were temporarily handed over to Li Shuchun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, for acting on his behalf. Before leaving, Li Shuchun asked Han for instructions, saying that the Daming Lake would soon hold the盂蘭盆 Festival. If he allowed it to be held, it would be close to superstition. If he did not allow it, then they would be disappointed because they do business here once a year at this time. What should he do? Han said that he could allow it to be held in order to embellish the scene of prosperity. (August 21st)</p>

<h3>Jinan Cracks Down on the Jindan Taoist Organization</h3>
<p>Liu Dongtian, disguised as a man, is arrested</p>
<p>Specializing in recruiting virgins, widows, and widowers</p>
<p>Nine virgins travel everywhere preaching</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong is known as the hometown of saints and sages, and an ancient land of culture. However, in recent days, people's hearts have deteriorated, and heterodox sects have been discovered repeatedly. The previous White Lotus Sect and Big Sword Society have long been eliminated, but the later Wuji Dao, Yilu Xiang, and Shengxian Dao are either remotely related to the same line or branches of other families, and their influence in the countryside cannot be underestimated. In the 18th year, Ma, the emperor of Zhoucun, caused chaos to the point of darkness, and now the evil sect is causing trouble in Jinan, where the provincial capital is located. On the 19th of this month, the Third District Public Security Bureau outside Jinan City unintentionally cracked down on the Jindan Taoist organization. The situation is roughly as follows: In the afternoon of the 19th, Qi Jinji, a patrol officer of the Third District outside the city, along with the household registration patrol chief and patrol police, went to Kuiguan Street in Dongguan to check household registrations. When they checked the backyard of the Taijintang Pharmacy at No. 23, they saw an old man with white hair and beard, and a very unfamiliar face. They asked him his name, age, and origin. The old man replied that his surname was Zhong and his name was Ziqing, that he was 64 years old, and that he was from Yichang, Hubei. They asked him what he had come to Jinan for, and he replied that he was here to handle medicinal materials and that he lived at the Liu's house (the owner of the pharmacy's surname is Liu). They also asked why he had not reported to the bureau, since this place was not allowed to accommodate idlers. The old man was speechless. Later, they found a written paper invitation in the courtyard, saying that it was specifically for charitable undertakings, recruiting young women, widows, and single men as followers. Officer Qi, suspecting that his appearance was suspicious, took the written paper invitation and Zhong Ziqing back to the bureau. Soon, someone came to the Third District Bureau to vouch for Zhong Ziqing. The bureau chief Li Anbang asked who he was. The person replied that his surname was Liu and his name was Dongtian, that he was 34 years old, that he was the owner of the Taijintang Pharmacy, and that his cousin Li Bingyi, who opened the Xiehuatang Pharmacy in Taian, had sent Zhong Ziqing to Jinan to handle medicinal materials and that he lived in his house. He requested to be allowed to vouch for him. Director Li asked since he was buying medicine, why did he write this paper invitation? Liu Huitian's expression suddenly changed and he did not answer. Director Li observed that Liu's voice and gait did not resemble a man, and he was very suspicious. He immediately asked why he was disguised as a man. Liu's expression changed drastically, but he still said why he was disguised as a man. Director Li then ordered him to be taken into the house for verification. It was indeed a woman. Director Li then asked, and Liu confessed that he was from Mengyin County, that he had lived in Jinan for three years, and that he lived in the house of his cousin Liu Li's. When asked why he had to disguise himself as a man, Liu replied that he was ordered by the Jindan Sect to come to Jinan to preach, and that he disguised himself as a man for the convenience of handling affairs and traveling. When asked what the Jindan Dao was, he replied that the Jindan Dao was specifically for charitable undertakings. When asked who the Jindan Dao was preached to, he replied that it specifically recruited young women, widows, and single men because the doctrine of the Jindan Dao was that men should not marry and women should not be married. When asked how many people had come with him, he replied that there were nine of them preaching, and that in addition to him, there were eight female Daoist friends who had come to Jinan with him. There were also two others who had now returned to Taian. When asked if his cousin also believed in the Jindan Dao, he replied that he did. When asked about Zhong Ziqing, he replied that he also believed. After questioning, Director Li sent Liu Dongtian and Zhong Ziqing, along with the written paper invitation, to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. (August 21st)</p>
<p>Joint Investigation by the Jilin Provincial Government and Municipal Preparatory Office</p>
<h3>Report on the Situation of Wanbaoshan</h3>
<p>The Jilin Provincial Government previously sent Zhang Qingyun to Changchun to discuss the withdrawal of Japanese police from Wanbaoshan and all related matters with the Municipal Preparatory Office. The office immediately ordered Zhou Wuxiang, Cui Chongmian, and Wei Ronghou to go together to investigate the various facts in detail, and to also conduct surveys of the surrounding terrain in order to clarify the situation. Zhang, Zhou, and others departed on the morning of the 8th and returned to Changchun together on the evening of the 12th. They organized the results of their investigation and attached a measured map, which they reported to the Municipal Office this month.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<h3>Important News Digest</h3>
<p>A telegram was sent on the 14th to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Harbin and the Jilin Provincial Government for their information. The report of the investigation into the Wanbaoshan incident is transcribed below:</p>
<p>(1) Location and Topography of Wanbaoshan</p>
<p>The area near Wanbaoshan Town is about four li wide from east to west and about three li long from north to south, all of which is plains. It is surrounded by gentle hills, but the southwest is lower, serving as a drainage outlet. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, the land was opened for cultivation. The town site was originally designated on the hillside, about four li away from the current town site. The current town site was originally a place where people who opened the land for cultivation lived together. Later, it gradually became prosperous. Today, there are sixteen shops, ninety-two households, and more than 1,100 men, women, and children. A market is held once every month on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th days. However, the town site reserved in the past has not been developed.</p>
<p>Wanbaoshan is sixty-five li northeast of Changchun County. Twenty-three li southwest of the town is the Majiashaokou along the Yitong River. There are villages and settlements all along the way. Residents near the river to the east and west use this place as a thoroughfare. The Yitong River flows from Yitong County, meandering north to the south of Changchun County. From there, it flows fifty li northeast to Majiashaokou. The width of the river near Changchun County is generally between twenty and thirty zhang. However, at Majiashaokou, the east and west banks are the narrowest, about fifteen zhang apart.</p>
<p>From Wanbaoshan Majiashaokou north, the river is about ten li wide and ninety-five li long, all of which are wild grasslands with very little cultivated land, all belonging to Changchun County. The Yitong River serves as the boundary. Three li north of the river is Nong'an County. North of Nong'an County, it is rumored to be the same kind of wild grassland.</p>
<p>Eighteen li southwest of Wanbaoshan is under the jurisdiction of the Third District of the Changchun County Public Security Bureau. Five li southwest of the Third District is the Second District along the Yitong River. East of the Yitong River is the Sixth District.</p>
<p>(2) Date of Korean Entry and Process of Digging Ditches</p>
<p>The Koreans in that area entered the country in three batches on April 9th, 10th, and 13th. On April 13th, more than 100 Koreans gathered at Majiashaokou along the Yitong River to worship the Yitong River God and the local Earth God in front of the village land temple. They then broke ground. On April 18th, they began digging a ditch on the land of Zhang Hongbin and twelve other households within the Third District. This section of the ditch started from the southwest corner of the boundary ditch of Meng Zhaoyue's reed marsh and ended at the west side of the houses in Shengjiatun. It was 4,228.50 meters long, with an average width of three meters and a depth of fifty centimeters. The soil piled up on both sides was each 1.50 meters wide, totaling more than seven li and sixty-one zhang. At the end of April, when the Koreans divided into gangs to the land of Sun Yongqing and forty-one other households within the Second District, thirty-two Koreans were stopped by eleven landlords, including Sun Yongqing and Ma Baoshan. The Koreans temporarily stopped work due to the obstruction. On May 1st, they came back to dig, and Sun Yongqing and others went to stop them again, and work stopped again due to the obstruction. The next day, the Koreans gathered more than one hundred people in a threatening manner and forcibly dug the ditch. Sun Yongqing and others went to stop them again, but they could not disperse them because there were too many Koreans. Later, Lu Qi, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, led more than two hundred infantry and cavalry to Majiashaokou before May 31st and implemented a ban in that area. At that time, the Koreans agreed to disperse, but after the director of the bureau left, the Koreans did not stop work. The number of ditch diggers reached more than 170 at the most. This section of the ditch extended from the southwest corner of Meng Zhaoyue's boundary ditch to Majiashaokou, with a total length of 5,300 meters. In addition to the existing ditch of 1,200 meters, the remaining 4,100 meters had an average width of 5.20 meters and a depth of 1.19 meters, with soil piled up on both sides of 4 meters each. The old ditch was more than two li and fifteen zhang long, and the newly dug ditch was more than seven li and twenty-one zhang long. The total length of the ditch from the land of Zhang Hongbin and twelve other households to the land of Sun Yongqing and forty-one other households was 9,528.50 meters, totaling more than sixteen li and ninety-seven zhang. The ditch, which was about two li away from the river mouth, began to be dug under the protection of plainclothes Japanese police officers after June 3rd.</p>
<p>On July 26th, Consul Yui of the Liaoning Consulate, and others, went to investigate. They inquired about the situation of the people's fields being flooded by the water from the ditch. They ordered the Koreans to block the ditch mouth along the river, and the blockage was completed on the 30th.</p>
<p>(3) Process of Koreans Building a Dam Across the River</p>
<p>After the plainclothes Japanese police officers went to protect the work again on June 12th, the Koreans began to weave rough wicker baskets to prepare for building the dam. On the 25th, they cut nearby willow branches and began to build the dam. On the 28th, the work was stopped due to water leakage in the earthen dam. On July 3rd, they resumed work, increasing the width and height, using willow branches and rice bags filled with soil. It was completed in a few days. On July 14th, they released water into the ditch, for a total of ten days. The average depth of the water in the ditch intended for rice fields was about one chi. It took about three days or more for the water released into the ditch to reach the area intended for rice planting. According to the Koreans Liu Hualong and Jin Guangde, the water flowing to the area intended for rice planting had nowhere to drain and flowed over to the neighboring land. In fact, the level of the area where the Koreans intended to plant rice was 2.40 meters higher than the bottom of the Yitong River. The actual measurement of the earthen dam across the river is as follows: the top of the dam is three meters wide, the bottom is sixteen meters wide, and the length is thirty meters. However, the north section of the dam is five meters higher than the riverbed, and the south section of the dam is only four meters higher than the riverbed because the riverbed on the south bank is leaking mud and being washed away by the water, so the south section is gradually collapsing by one meter. After the dam was completed and the water was tested, the Koreans dismantled the middle section of the dam into a concave opening to release the water because the remaining water in the rice field area had nowhere to drain. Recently, they have gradually dismantled it further. The current concave opening in the middle section is six meters wide and 2.50 meters deep. The deepest part of the water upstream of the dam is 2.60 meters, and the deepest part of the water downstream of the dam is 1.30 meters. The water level inside the dam is 1.30 meters higher than the water level outside the dam. Since the Japanese police withdrew on August 8th, the Koreans in Yaowozi, about five li away, have been going to the concave part of the middle section of the dam from time to time to remove willow branches for cooking fuel. (4) Korean Rice Planting Situation</p>
<p>Because the agricultural season had passed and the ditches and dams had not been completed, the Koreans did not have time to divert water into the ditches for irrigation in the uncultivated land rented from Zhang Hongbin. They did not remove the weeds or divide the area into rice paddies. They randomly scattered the rice seeds in the grassland, covering an area of about ten mu. The rice seedlings are only about three cun tall and are found sporadically in the weeds that are more than three chi deep.</p>
<p>(5) The Withdrawal and Stationing of Chinese and Japanese Police in the Area</p>
<p>On May 26th, Tsuchiya Bohei, the resident of the Japanese Consulate in Changchun, along with the translator Takahashi and two Japanese police officers, went to the Third Public Security Bureau of Wanbaoshan to inquire about the situation of the Korean landlords sending their cases to the county. They stayed overnight at Jiajiadian in the district and returned to Yaowozi the next day. On May 31st, Lu Qi, the director of the Changchun County Public Security Bureau, was ordered to lead more than two hundred mounted police officers to stay in the Wanbaoshan area to stop the Koreans from forcibly digging ditches.</p>
<p>On June 3rd, several Japanese plainclothes police officers, carrying handguns, went to protect the Koreans and continued to complete the more than two li long waterway work near Majiashaokou.</p>
<p>On June 4th, the county police withdrew to avoid conflict.</p>
<p>On June 8th, it was agreed between the Municipal Preparatory Office and the Japanese Consul in Changchun that both sides would withdraw their police, the Koreans would stop working, and both sides would send personnel to conduct an on-site joint investigation to resolve the matter fairly.</p>
<p>At Chenshi (7-9 am) on June 9th, the Japanese police withdrew. On the same day, Guo Chenghou, the chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, Wu Changchun, the director-general of the Changchun County Farmers' Association, Liang Xuegui, the inspector of the Changchun Public Security Bureau, Tsuchiboshi Bohei, the clerk of the Japanese Consulate in Changchun, Police Officer Nakagawa Yoshiharu, and Ryutani Tamotsu, the director of foreign affairs at the Changchun Regional Office of the South Manchuria Railway Company, went to conduct an on-site investigation and returned to the city one after another on the 11th.</p>
<p>At 9:00 pm on June 11th, the Japanese Consul in Changchun declared to the Municipal Preparatory Office that he would send police to protect the Koreans to continue working the next day. At the same time, the Municipal Preparatory Office sent a letter to the Japanese Consul stating that the results of the joint investigation showed that the ditch and dam work was not feasible in terms of law and fact and could not be tolerated under any circumstances. On the 12th, a formal letter was sent to the Japanese Consul as a final warning that if they acted freely, they would bear full responsibility for any disputes that arose. On that day, several plainclothes Japanese police officers, carrying handguns, continued to go there. Protests were made repeatedly, but they did not withdraw.</p>
<p>On July 1st, more than 300 farmers gathered because the ditch interrupted the fields and hindered cultivation. They carried out justifiable self-defense to restore the original state. On the afternoon of that day, armed Japanese police officers carrying machine guns set out to go there.</p>
<p>At Chenshi (7-9 am) on July 2nd, farmers gathered and were about to continue leveling the ditch when the Japanese police opened fire and strafed as a show of force. The number of armed Japanese police officers increased to more than 50, and the plainclothes team of about ten people occupied the surrounding earthen walls of Majiashaokou and He's house, where a gun emplacement had been built. At 6:00 pm, Police Officer Nakagawa Yoshiharu reported to the Kwantung Leased Territory using carrier pigeons, requesting that another thousand reinforcements be sent. (The above carrier pigeons were obtained by Liang Shuxian and notified by the Yuanning Negotiation Office.) On the same day, the wife of Yu Ma, the grandson of Yu Ze, a resident of the village in front of Majiashaokou, was in labor when two Japanese police officers forcibly occupied the house, acting ferociously. She was so frightened that the fetus turned in her abdomen and could not be born. She died at 10:00 am the next day due to fright, and both mother and child died.</p>
<p>On July 4th, Kuramoto Hideaki, the foreign affairs officer of the Japanese Consulate in Changchun, and Patrolmen Goto Tane and Naganuma Akio, went to the Third Public Security Bureau of Wanbaoshan and requested to meet with the representatives who leveled the ditch. Everyone had already gone elsewhere and was not met.</p>
<p>On July 5th, three military-use cloth tents were set up east of the ditch, and two reed sheds, each ten zhang long and one zhang and five chi wide, were built west of the ditch. On the morning of that day, the Japanese flag was hung on the river bank of Majiashaokou. Shortly after, it was moved to the highest point of the Korean people's graves in the north mountain of Huangjiapu and hung on a pole for a day.</p>
<p>On July 15th, Takahashi the translator took four Japanese police officers to the Third Public Security Bureau of Wanbaoshan to inquire about the ages and addresses of the twelve landlords, including Zhang Hongbin. They did not receive a reply and returned to Majiashaokou.</p>
<p>On the same day, the Japanese police informed the nearby residents to go to Majiashaokou to watch the demonstration of the machine gun. After the demonstration, they asked the residents whether they had been involved in leveling the ditch last time, and asked why they were not virtuous in buying vegetables from the Japanese. They asked whether they knew that this was a machine gun, how many rounds it could fire in a second, and threatened that if they were not afraid and took any further extraordinary actions, they would use this gun to kill them all. On July 26th, Consul Yui of the Japanese Consulate in Liaoning and others, ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate the situation of Koreans in Jilin and Heilongjiang, took four cars and went to Wanbaoshan on that day to conduct an on-site investigation. They inquired about the situation of farmers' ditch water being introduced into the rice field area, flooding the neighboring land, and ordered the ditch mouth along the river to be blocked, which was completed the next day.</p>
<p>On August 6th, Kuramoto Hideaki, the foreign affairs officer of the Japanese Consulate in Changchun, declared to the Municipal Preparatory Office that he would go to Majiashaokou the next day, bringing Japanese police officers with him, and would withdraw all of them on the 8th.</p>
<p>At 1:00 pm on August 8th, Kuramoto Hideaki led twenty-six Japanese police officers with large and small guns and a machine gun in eight trains and withdrew from Majiashaokou. The cloth tents and reed sheds along the river were all removed.</p>
<p>At the same time, within the jurisdiction of the Third Public Security Bureau of Wanbaoshan, six police officers were transferred by Director Cao Longbiao and stationed in Zhang Hongbin's courtyard, where the Koreans lived. Within the jurisdiction of the Second Public Security Bureau of Baizigou, six police officers were transferred by Director Tian Xigu and a patrol officer was stationed in He Chunrong's courtyard in Majiashaokou.</p>
<p>(6) Farmers' Losses</p>
<p>Farmers' losses can be classified as follows: A) Cost of restoring land to its original state: The ditch occupied 19 mu and 8 fen and 5 li of farmland. Excluding the old ditch, the Koreans actually dug 15,600 fang (one chi high and one zhang square) of ditch. The cost of restoring it to its original state is one yuan per fang zhang, totaling 15,600 Harbin dollars. In addition, the cost of fertilizer and restoration of the above farmland is 208 yuan. (The above is based on the statements of all farmers.) B) Loss of farmland cultivation detour on both sides of the ditch: The households' hot fields are separated into two sections by the ditch. Although there are four earthen bridges that can be used for passage and five that can be used for vehicles and horses, the daily traffic and detours have resulted in more time and labor for cultivation. The exact amount of this loss is difficult to determine for the time being. C) Loss of destroyed and occupied farmland: The ditch occupied 17 mu and 3 fen and 5 li of cultivated land. This year's loss of seeds, labor, and fodder is about 60 yuan. In addition, each year, 34 shi and 7 dou of soybeans, red sorghum, and millet are produced. This year's total loss of various grains is 104 shi and 1 dou. (The above is based on the statements of each farmer.) In addition, a section of Ma Wanshan's tobacco field along the river, 40 meters long from east to west and an average of 10 meters wide from north to south, was occupied by the Japanese police to build tents, reed sheds, or dig trenches. In addition, in Sun Yongbin's soybean field about 80 meters north of Shaokou, a trench was dug by the Japanese police, one meter wide and thirty meters long, and the surrounding seedlings were trampled on. This year's loss is about ten shi of soybeans. (The above is based on the statements of farmers Ma Wanshan and Sun Yongbin.) In addition, the Koreans forcibly cut willow branches along the river to build the dam, totaling 66 mu: 26 mu for Sun Yongqing, 10 mu for Ma Wanshan, and 30 mu for Yu Huichuan. This year's total loss is 3,500 bundles of willow branches. (The above is based on the statements of each household.) D) Flooded farmland during the trial water release after the dam was completed: The neighboring fields in the trial rice planting area were flooded for a short period of three days during the trial water release after the dam was completed. However, because the water spread very quickly and it was a long period of sunny and dry weather, there was no significant loss. However, Han Dianqi's one and a half mu of soybean field west of the river in Shaokou was flooded, and two mu were trampled on by the Japanese police. This year's total loss is seventeen shi of soybeans. In addition, Wang Xian's five mu of soybean field west of the river in Shaokou resulted in a loss of thirty shi of soybeans this year. (The above is based on the statements of each household.) E) Public expenses for each household: Because the legal rights of each household were violated, they held meetings and went to the city to petition, incurring travel expenses and hotel fees. The actual amount used has already reached 436 yuan. This case has not yet been finally resolved and is difficult to stop. (The above is based on the statements of all farmers.)</p>
<p>(7) Current Situation of Koreans and Their Residences</p>
<p>Currently, the Koreans living in that area come from Karen and Shuangyang County, as well as Guyushu, Jiaohe, Tuibo Station, and Yantongshan, all under the jurisdiction of Jilin Province, and Kaiyuan County and Shijianfang, under the jurisdiction of Liaoning Province. Cai Yuanhao and An Bingshan, two households, live in two rooms of Pei Fengnian's house in Shengjiatun; Shen Yunze, Quan Taidou, and Li Zuohe, three households, live in three and a half rooms of Zhang Jingsheng's house in Jiangjia Wopeng; Shen Haichun, Jiang Yuanzuo, Liu Longhua, Zheng Mingshu, Bian Xiangren, An Zaichun, Lin Zhentai, Li Zhihe, Zhu Jishou, and Zhang Xiji, ten households, live in nine and a half rooms of Zhang Hongbin's house; Jin Longwu, Cui Shimo, Jin Jingquan, Pu Dongzu, and Du Wusheng, five households, live in three and a half rooms of Zhou Tai's house in Yaowozi; Song Qi and Jin Haidong, two households, live in two rooms of Sun Yongchang's house in Dongjiatun. All 22 households and their nine leaders live in Toudaogou.</p>
<p>(8) Investigation Period</p>
<p>The facts stated above were investigated on-site by Zhang Qingyun, an investigator from the Jilin Provincial Government, and Zhou Wuxiang, Cui Chongmian, and Wei Ronghou, investigators from the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, on August 8th. It lasted for twelve days.</p>
<h3>Carrier Pigeon in the Wanbaoshan Incident</h3>
<p>Lost and Captured by Villagers</p>
<p>Japanese Police Chief Seeks Troops</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence, July 24th. Villagers in Lanjia Fort, Lishu County, suddenly caught two pigeons. Both pigeons had white iron hoops on their legs, one marked (Guan ) and one marked ( Gong ). They also had two black rings, and a small iron box inside the ring contained a rolled-up piece of Japanese paper. The text was reported by Nakagawa Yoshiharu on July 2nd. After carefully translating the meaning of the text, it was definitely related to the Wanbaoshan incident. The carrier pigeons were photographed, temporarily raised, and the photos and translation were sent to the county. The reporter learned that Nakagawa Yoshiharu was the chief of the police station at the Japanese Consulate in Changchun. Tashiro Shigetoku, the Japanese Consul in Changchun, had sent the chief to be stationed in the Majiashaokou area as early as the beginning of June to supervise the Koreans in forcibly digging ditches and building dams across the river. On July 1st, the farmers in the area could no longer endure it and mutually called for filling in the trenches for self-defense. On the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese police used machine guns to strafe. The situation in this case was most tense on this day. This carrier pigeon was dispatched at 6:45 pm on the same day, stating that the entire force should be moved to prevent the cessation of a certain project, and that more than 1,000 people should be dispatched on the waterway. This was a request to the Kwantung Leased Territory for troops. It is clear that the chief wanted to continue the project with determination in order to implement his policy of violent occupation. Although we captured two of the carrier pigeons, it is easy to imagine what the situation would have been if the others had not been captured. It was fortunate that the Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory was not moved. The original text is translated into Chinese and attached below:</p>
<p>Reported at 6:40 pm on July 2nd. Nakagawa and others arrived at the local area safely. Our team dares to report that everything is safe. At 5:00 pm on the same day, the rioters gathered at Yongqing's house to discuss a certain matter. At 6:40 pm, each tribe began to disperse. We are currently fully prepared with all available numbers. We are confident about the raid tonight. Although we cannot predict tomorrow's riot, we must work hard to conduct secret investigations and report it with pigeons tomorrow morning. At 6:45 pm, the outline of this case was reported to Consul Tashiro in the name of the chief of the First Branch Office. The entire force should be moved to prevent the cessation of a certain project, and more than 1,000 people should be dispatched on the waterway because there is a risk of conflict. This report is made in the form of a painting and we pray for a speedy reply. Nakagawa Yoshiharu.</p>
<h3>The Potential Danger of Changes to the Tumen River Course</h3>
<p>Jilin Correspondence. The four counties of Helong, Wangqing, Yanji and Hunchun in Jilin Province are all located along the Tumen River, facing the Japanese-administered Korea across the river. A line of river flow is the border between China and Japan. However, since 1925 and 1926, the Japanese side has been piling up sand and stones to block the river flow at various places opposite Liangshuiquanzi in Helong County and the Gaya River in Wangqing County, which flows to the left bank and endangers our territory. Recently, the Railway Bureau of the Japanese Governor-General of Korea designed to change the Tumen light railway to a wide-gauge railway, which started in early June, starting with a section between Huining and Heipo, which is more than forty Chinese li. The road runs along the Tumen River on the right and leans against steep mountains on the left. To build the road and operate the train, the mountains must be chiseled through. The Japanese side filled all the excavated sand and stones into the river, blocking the river's path, and the entire river's flow has turned towards our bank, washing away the fertile land along the river. The river flow in the Jiangcun Village of the Jicha Office and the Maolin Township, and the Beixing Street of the Zhenxing Township, is in danger of being diverted. In the future, international boundary affairs may lead to endless disputes, and the Japanese people will use the excuse that they are working on the river bank on their side. If the police from our county go to stop them, they will find some pretext. This kind of incident has occurred frequently over the years. It is unknown how the authorities will deal with it after learning from past mistakes.</p>
<h3>Chen Diaoyuan Goes to Beijing to Discuss Finance</h3>
<p>Anhui Province Plans to Issue Bonds Worth Three Million</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence. Chen Diaoyuan previously inspected Hefei and Liu'an. Due to the severe flooding in the province, he returned to his post and dispatched Fan Xiji, the commander of the 26th Army, and Liu Pengyi, the director of the Finance Department, to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang, report on the military affairs of suppressing bandits in Anhui Province, and ask for instructions on the financial problems after the flood. Fan and Liu returned to Anhui on the 20th to report. However, Chen still needed to meet with Chiang to discuss financial problems, so he took the Jianguo ship to Beijing at 10 pm on the 21st. Anhui's finances are insufficient. The current budget for the 20th year is short by 1.5 million, plus the deficit of 2 million from the 19th year. If sorted out, it can still be made up for. However, this year's disaster is unusually severe, affecting 44 counties. The land tax originally budgeted for more than 4 million is difficult to collect even half of. The various miscellaneous taxes that have been contracted out by each county are also being returned one after another, and there is no way to raise administrative expenses. The most important thing is disaster relief funds, which are also difficult to manage. The provincial government plans to issue bonds worth 3 million yuan to raise funds for post-disaster relief. Finance Director Liu Pengyi obtained Chiang's approval in Jiangxi, but this fund still needs to be raised separately. In addition, two other measures are planned, one is to collect handling fees for grain exports, which combines prohibition and collection, and the other is to raise funds for cigarette surcharges. However, before the bonds are raised, the original road construction bond fund will be temporarily used. (August 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Movement to Refuse to Read the "Min Bao" in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>All Circles Resolved on Six Measures to Ban</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence. The "Min Bao," run by the Japanese, has been the fairest newspaper in this port for many years and has been very popular. Therefore, the business community trusts it. This newspaper was established by the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, and the director is also appointed by the Governor-General's Office. Recently, all the sensational news has contained provocative effects. Although the Party Headquarters has repeatedly warned it, it has refused to listen. Since the anti-Japanese movement, the local newspapers have been attacking Japanese actions fiercely. In addition to submitting negotiations to the provincial government to demand a ban, the Japanese Consul in Fujian also claimed that the Anti-Japanese Association was an illegal organization that hindered the business of Japanese merchants and requested its dissolution. The "Min Bao" even spoke for the consul, ridiculing the patriotic movement of the Chinese people, which aroused public outrage, leading to the launch of a movement to refuse to read the "Min Bao." In particular, the Party Headquarters' attitude was the most激昂. On the morning of the 17th of this month, the Fuzhou Anti-Japanese Association specially convened all the newspaper reporters in the city to discuss how to deal with the situation. It was agreed that the "Min Bao" usually specializes in fabricating rumors and confusing the public, and that ignorant people call its remarks brave and its news well-informed, so its sales and advertisements rank first among the newspapers in Fuzhou. Together with the Dongying School, it is one of the two major institutions of Japanese cultural aggression in Fujian and must be thoroughly defeated. It was resolved that (A) the Dongying School should be severely banned by the Education Department, only allowing it to recruit Taiwanese students traveling to Fujian and not allowing it to recruit Chinese students. (B) Regarding the "Min Bao": 1. The Post Office should not be allowed to deliver newspapers on its behalf. 2. The Telegraph Office should not be allowed to send telegrams on its behalf. 3. Each institution should not supply news material. 4. Chinese people serving in the newspaper should be notified to withdraw immediately. 5. Newspaper readers should be notified to stop reading the newspaper. 6. Businesses should be notified not to publish advertisements in the newspaper. The measures were to be implemented separately starting on the 18th.</p>
<p>Fuzhou's Japanese goods have been notified by the Anti-Japanese Association to stop purchasing them on August 8th, and those who violate the order will have their seals removed and confiscated. The labor unions at the ships and docks were notified not to transport or unload them on its behalf. However, Japanese postal ships recently imported from Taiwan and Dalian are still carrying a large amount of seafood, fresh fruits, fabrics, and white sugar. Police officers from the Japanese Consulate and Taiwanese people are carrying handguns to protect the unloading at the Customs Yard and transport them to warehouses. Some profiteering merchants are also buying them. After the Anti-Japanese Association discovered this, it has sealed off several companies. It is also reported that Japanese police officers are carrying weapons in the mainland, which is detrimental to sovereignty. If a conflict occurs, who will be responsible? It will be presented to the provincial government to protest to the Japanese Consul. (August 18th)</p>
<h3>Coastal Wind Disaster in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>The Losses Are Very Severe</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The recent wind and rain storms in the coastal counties of Fujian Province have caused disasters, with the waters of the Tai River and Hong River rising sharply. The losses are extremely severe. Details are as follows: (1) Minhou County: Along the Min River in the Southwest Port, from Baisha to Nanyu and other villages, the roof tiles of houses were blown off, and many walls collapsed. Longan, lychee, yellow tangerine, and white olive trees were stripped of their fruits, resulting in losses of up to 500,000 yuan. (2) Gutian County: The water level in the city exceeded the height of houses, submerging fields and gardens, and countless people and livestock were killed. Although the floodwaters have receded, the scene is filled with crumbling walls and broken tiles, a desolate and unbearable sight. The autumn harvest is completely ruined, and tens of thousands of starving people are crying out for food. (3) Luoyuan County: Two-fifths of the houses in the city were blown down (the county government also completely collapsed). In the countryside, sand and rocks flew, and fields and gardens were buried. Streets were filled with rubble, and trees on the mountains were scattered horizontally. The losses are no less than 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. (4) Lianjiang County: In the coastal towns of Xiaocheng and Zhenhai, more than one hundred fishing boats sank, and over two hundred fishermen drowned. More than one hundred houses collapsed, leaving hundreds homeless. (5) Xiapu County, Sansha: Over four thousand houses were destroyed, and over one hundred people were crushed by walls or drowned. All fields and gardens were submerged. Looking around Sansha, there is not a single piece of clean land. Most of the public and private buildings in the county seat also collapsed. (6) Ningde County, Dongchong Town: All the houses in the town were blown over, and people stood in the wind and rain for almost a day and night. Those who are now homeless are still sheltering in the mountains, hoping for relief. (7) Fuding County, Shacheng: Eight or nine out of ten coastal houses were destroyed, and over three hundred boats were damaged. The British ship "Guangsheng" also sank, and one hundred and eighty boatmen drowned. Floating corpses fill the sea, a sight too horrible to bear. (August 20)</p>
<p>Chilean Chinese Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Advises Compatriots Not to Go to Chile Again</h3>
<p>Because Most Overseas Chinese in Chile Are Unemployed</p>
<p>Chile is located far in the southwest of South America. The country's main product is nitrate ore, so the prosperity or decline of the nitrate industry is closely related to the country. When the nitrate mines are booming, businesses are densely located around the mines, and merchants and traders are everywhere. There are about two thousand overseas Chinese in Chile, most of whom operate around the nitrate mines, and their livelihoods are quite active. Since the development of chemical nitrates in Europe, Chilean nitrates have been greatly affected and are declining day by day, causing nitrate mines throughout the country to close down. Countless workers have lost their jobs, and most of the shops around the nitrate mines have closed down. The business in other major ports has also become desolate. The overseas Chinese business has fallen sharply, with losses of eighty percent. Those who have not lost their jobs can only maintain the status quo, and the future is uncertain. Those who have lost their jobs have no one to rely on and cannot continue to feed themselves, even to the point where fathers and sons cannot take care of each other. Their plight has reached an extreme. However, some compatriots are still unaware of the situation and continue to go to Chile, resulting in no way to make a living. The Chilean Iquique Chinese Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter back to China to inform all compatriots, hoping that they will not think of coming to Chile again, to avoid being trapped in poverty. Moreover, coming to Chile requires spending thousands of yuan on travel expenses and venturing to a remote place tens of thousands of miles away, which is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Ji Court</p>
<h3>Determines That Zhu Shede Committed Suicide</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Regarding the tragic death of female teacher Zhu Shede, the Jinan District Court yesterday summoned Zhang Jigui, the driver of Wang Weijun, to court for investigation. The situation has been detailed in previous letters. It is now learned that at 10 o'clock, the plaintiffs Zhu Shuxin, Zhu Jichang, and Zhu Meirong, and their agent Zhu Xifang, were also summoned to court, along with Liu Kunshan, the principal of the Provincial No. 2 Experimental Elementary School, and Ma Longxuan, the owner of No. 30 Xixiaowangfu Street. The chief prosecutor of the Zhu case, Liu Rongshan, opened the trial in the first investigation court, and the public was still prohibited from attending. The details of the interrogation are as follows: First, Zhu Shuxin and others were asked whether they had found any suspicious points in the past two days, and whether the blood-stained clothes and cloths from when Zhu Shude gave birth were brought, and what they were meant for when they were given to them. The answer was that the blood-stained clothes and cloths had already been brought, but when Shude gave them to us, she only said to take them home and look at them to understand her. At that time, we were afraid that she would have disputes with Wang Weijun over marriage issues, so we kept them as evidence, and we never thought that she would be murdered. Zhu Meirong then asked the judge where the bullet landed when the inspection was conducted, where the bullet casing fell, and whether suicide or murder could be proven. It was not found during the inspection, and asked to search Wang's house carefully again. The judge said that the bullet casing had been sent by the Third Public Security Bureau outside the city, and the letter said that it was swept out from under the ground by the local head Wang Yuan. Of course, we can go to find the bullet. Zhu Meirong asked if we could go together, but the judge did not answer. Then, Zhu Xifang was asked his name, age, and occupation, and why he did not come to court earlier. He replied that he did not understand very well at first. He was asked what suspicious points he had. He replied that the bloodstains were not dry, where the bullet landed, and the coroner's report did not state these details. Zhu Shude was undoubtedly murdered. After Zhu Meirong inquired, whether Zhu Shude was murdered or committed suicide, Prosecutor Liu said that according to our inspection, it was indeed suicide. If you believe that she was murdered, you can search for evidence. Then, Principal Liu Kunshan was asked how Zhu Shude became a teacher at your school, who introduced her, when she came to the school, and whether you knew about it. He replied that Zhu Shude was previously a teacher at the Provincial No. 3 Experimental School, and was introduced to our school by Wang Weijun. I did not know about the relationship between Zhu and Wang. If I had known, I would never have asked her to be a teacher. She took leave in the second half of last year and did not come to school to teach. She only returned to school and resumed her duties at the beginning of the spring semester this year. I asked her to live in the school, but Zhu Shude refused, saying that she could not live in the school because she was teaching Wang Weijun's second son English at Wang's house. Zhu Shude's tragic death occurred during the summer vacation, and I did not know anything about it. The prosecutor inquired in detail repeatedly, and after an hour, he asked Ma Longxuan, the owner of No. 30 Xixiaowangfu Street, who testified that he did rent the house to Chief Wang last year, which was true. It was said that he was the chief of the Department of Education, and had a wife and servants. At that time, because he already had family members and served as the chief of the Department of Education, I allowed it. As for the household registration name, he reported it automatically. My house is on Tianditan Street, which is far from Xixiaowangfu, and Chief Wang rented a separate courtyard, so I have never been to his courtyard. I do not know all the details. The court adjourned at 1 p.m. Today (21st) at 9 a.m., Prosecutor Liu Rongshan, accompanied by a bailiff, went to Wang Weijun's house in Shenjia Hutong, Dongguan by rickshaw. Yang Yichao, a police officer from the Public Security Bureau in that area, and the local head Wang Yuan also arrived. Wang Weijun's mother led them to Zhu Shude's former residence in the west room. Cobwebs, bird droppings, and dust were everywhere. The house was empty and the scene was desolate. They inspected the surroundings inside the room for a week, looking for bullets and bullet marks on the walls and floor, but found nothing. When the local head Wang Yuan was asked about the situation of finding the bullet casing, he said that after the court's inspection was completed on the 28th, I found the bullet casing under the east window while sweeping the floor, but I did not see the bullet. Prosecutor Liu returned to the court. Zhu Shude lived in the west room and was lying on the west bed with her head facing north when she died. Now the bullet casing was found under the east window, and the bullet was not found in the room, which is indeed a question. (21st)</p>

<p>The Mastermind Behind the Murder of the Incense Master is Arrested. Qin Arong, the incense master of Jin Fu Nunnery in Yangshan, Huguan Township, Suzhou, was murdered. The District Procuratorate detained the nun of the nunnery, Wu Lian, and the incense master Cai Maorong for interrogation. Blood-stained clothes, iron guns, and other items were found in the nunnery. It has now been found that the mastermind behind the case is the abbot of the temple and the abbot of the Dongzhutang Temple, Monk Daolin. The District Procuratorate dispatched police to arrest Daolin at Wang Peizheng's house in Yanjia Lane in the city and escorted him to the court. He was detained separately from the other criminals and not allowed to see anyone, pending interrogation. The Command Continues to Capture Bandits. Li Haiming and other detectives from the Taihu Bandit Suppression Command captured a bandit named Li Yaode at the Yilettian Teahouse in Huqiu on the 22nd, and found a box cannon and forty-nine bullets in his house. The bandit was escorted to the command for interrogation. On the 23rd, Li Yaode's uncle, Li Chuanzhou, was arrested and handed over to the Third Public Security Bureau. Li Chuanzhou is already sixty-eight years old. According to Li Chuanzhou, Li Haiming is his nephew, and he was falsely accused of being a bandit due to loan relations. The gun found in Li Yaode's house belongs to Li Haiming. The Business Community Studies Substitutes for Japanese Goods. The businessmen of Suzhou have shown great determination in their economic boycott of Japan this time. However, because boycotting Japanese goods is not a long-term solution, they suggested that the Chamber of Commerce study substitutes for Japanese goods as soon as possible to solve the root cause of promoting domestic goods. The Chamber of Commerce has forwarded this suggestion to the Domestic Goods Promotion Association and the Domestic Goods Relief Association for joint research.</p>

Eight rifles were robbed. Then they went to the Ni family in Xishi and kidnapped six men and women. They also went to the Gu family, but fortunately the door was strong and they could not enter. Then they went to the Zhu Tongtai grocery store and robbed it clean before leaving. Before leaving, the bandits mistakenly cut the electric light wires, but the telephone wires were intact, so they were able to send an urgent telegram to the police in Jiashan and Jiaxing.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Embezzlement Case of the Finance Bureau Opens for Investigation. Shen Guiqing, the owner of Jiuhe Rice Shop in Santiaoqiao, Beitang, Wuxi County, bought a house from the Xiaojianshang Pacific Soap Factory last winter for 28,000 yuan. He submitted the deed to the Miscellaneous Tax Office of the County Finance Bureau for tax payment and verification as required, totaling 3,690 yuan and 4 jiao in tax. At that time, the director of the Miscellaneous Tax Office was Jiang Yunlong, a native of Changzhou, who was a relative of the former director Zhuang Yeguang. He immediately embezzled the tax money and fled to Shanghai, where he gambled heavily in a gambling den and lost everything. Later, Jiang had no way to make up for it and disappeared without a trace. Not long after, former Director Zhuang was ordered to be transferred to the position of Director of the Finance Bureau of Changshu County. He had to bear the pain and compensate the full amount. He reported the situation to the Department of Finance and requested the arrest of Zhuang Yunlong. The Department of Finance submitted the report to the Provincial Government for review, and the Provincial Government instructed the Department of Civil Affairs to instruct all counties to cooperate in the arrest. The Department of Finance also instructed the current Director of the Finance Bureau of Wuxi County, Wang Jingzhi, to transfer the case files to the County Court for investigation in accordance with the law. Yesterday was the date for the court hearing of the case. Prosecutor Du summoned the buyer Shen Guiqing, Finance Bureau officials Zhao Ling, Xu Yaosheng, Liu Cuibao, Shen's landlord Sun Baoshu, and Shenxin employee Xue Mingjian to court for investigation. The interrogation lasted for three hours before it was completed. As a result, Shen Guiqing was released on bail, and the others were ordered to return home and await the arrest of Zhuang Yunlong for interrogation.</p>

Security Chief Zhu reported this to County Magistrate Chen through the county government, who secretly ordered Xu Jigui, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to immediately dispatch detective team leader Xue Furui, along with detectives Shen Minhua and Tang Yuting, to arrest him. They captured the suspect Zhu in a small boat under the Gongyun Bridge, interrogated him severely, and escorted him to the Public Security Bureau.

He married a wife, Shen, who is very unruly. Recently, because Peiqing was old and weak and unable to work, he asked for leave on the 27th of last month on the lunar calendar to return to Wuxi to find another business. The day before yesterday, he asked his wife Shen for two hundred yuan to buy a water-lifting machine with a friend, but Shen not only refused but also insulted Peiqing greatly, resulting in a quarrel. Then they fought. Shen was so angry that she squeezed and broke Peiqing's scrotum, causing blood to flow continuously, and he fell to the ground in extreme pain.

<p>Major Fire in Zeshan Town. Tongxing Grocery Store in Zeshan Town, East Township of Xiaoshan, caught fire on the night of the 20th due to carelessness with a kerosene lamp. The fire spread to more than thirty shops on the left and right.

As a result, forty-eight houses were burned to the ground, with losses estimated at more than 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Xinghua</h3>
<p>The Heartbreaking and Tragic Disaster Situation in Xinghua. Among the floods in various places this year, the situation in Jiangbei is the most severe. Among the disasters in Jiangbei, the most tragic is in Xinghua. Xinghua is located downstream, shaped like the bottom of a pot. Since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has caused disasters, and low-lying fields have become swamps. The water outside the city is also several feet deep. Then, seven days before autumn, the Che Nan and Xin San Dams were successively opened, and the water level suddenly increased by four feet. The city walls were half submerged in the water, and residents in the low-lying areas were in danger of drowning. The streets and markets in the east gate area, which were once known for their prosperity, can now only be traveled by boat. The county government, being the highest point in the county, is crowded with people building reed sheds. It has become a de facto refugee camp. Those who arrive later have no place to stay and cry to each other. The situation is extremely tragic. Outside the city, there is a vast expanse of water, and the water and sky are connected for hundreds of miles, no different from Taihu Lake. At the highest point, the water has submerged the telegraph poles, causing postal and telecommunications to be cut off, traffic to be blocked, and almost isolated from the outside world. Not only is there no harvest of fields and crops, but it is also impossible to find a place to live. The wealthy live on boats, while those below the middle class build nests on trees and boards. They eat water algae and tree leaves to fill their stomachs. Floating corpses can be seen everywhere in the water. The county has suffered four years of consecutive famine and is now suffering from this disaster. If relief is not quickly planned, 600,000 people will starve to death. It is also heard that the military, political, educational, and other institutions in the county have been paralyzed. The city is like an empty tomb. The tragedy of the disaster is truly unprecedented in history.</p>

<h3>(II) Reception by the Department of Education</h3>
<p>On the 22nd at 2 p.m., Director Chen of the Department of Education held a meeting to welcome members of the Science Society and invited Mr. Cai Zimin to give a speech. Mr. Cai rose and briefly stated that Jiangsu education is a model for all provinces. He said, "You all have specialized knowledge and rich experience in handling affairs. What I hope for as a brother is that (1) in recent years in China, not only do students not have the opportunity to enter middle school, but even entering a famous elementary school is often subject to strict limitations due to insufficient supply to meet demand, preventing them from studying. In foreign countries, parents or elder brothers are punished if elementary school students do not attend school. Today in China, parents and elder brothers want to send their children to school, but there are no schools to enter. Foreign countries, in addition to school-age children, also consider the education of illiterate adults. China is still unable to educate school-age children, which is a major problem. China is currently unable to produce students who can go from elementary school to university. Middle schools must become vocationalized. We must seek education for those who graduate from a certain level of schooling but cannot afford to continue their education and want to survive in society. In addition to schools at all levels, there should be supplementary schools. These schools should be categorized by subject. Even hairdressing and foot care should have supplementary schools. At the same time, we should also seek supplementary education in civic morality and general knowledge for adults who already have jobs. This is also a future education problem."</p>
<h3>(III) Opening Ceremony of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>The 16th General Assembly was held in the auditorium of the Department of Education at 3 p.m. on the 22nd, with over a thousand people attending. It was chaired by Cai Zimin, and the ceremony was conducted as usual. Mr. Cai reported that the Science Society was initiated in the United States and established in Nanjing and Shanghai, all of which have historical connections with Jiangsu. Zhenjiang, as the new capital of Jiangsu, has all its facilities on the path of scientific construction, and Jin Jiao and Beigu are famous scenic spots in the world. The warm hospitality of the provincial government officials has made our members very comfortable in holding the meeting, for which we are very grateful. The work of our society can be divided into two parts: (1) the work of the unified society, and (2) the work of the members outside. In recent years, we have established a biological research institute in Nanjing and a science library. The library is now building a new site in Shanghai, named the Mingfu Library, in honor of Mr. Hu Mingfu, a senior member of the Science Society. In addition, members of our society are working in the Central Research Institute and the Peiping Research Institute. However, compared to world science, Chinese science is still very immature. For example, this year's flood in China, although a major force of nature, is beyond the ability of science to resist. However, scientific equipment can sometimes reduce the degree of natural disasters, such as afforestation and river defense before the flood, forecasting and warning during the disaster, and calculating the disaster area, settling the victims, and providing for the needs of the disaster area after the disaster. Therefore, in countries with advanced science, even if they encounter natural disasters, the suffering of their people is less than that of those who do not emphasize science. Therefore, those responsible for science in China should make efforts above any other country." Next, Hu Pu'an delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the provincial government. Subsequently, Zhu Oufang from Nanjing Society, Ding Xubao from Shenyang Society, Chen Zongnan from Guangzhou Society, Wang Cundian from Suzhou Society, and Wang Jiliang from Shanghai Society gave their reports successively. The meeting adjourned after a photograph.</p>

<p>All-Japan Women's Swimming Championships</p>
<h3>Creates Four New Championship Records</h3>
<p>Japanese Swimming Will Dominate the World</p>
<p>(Great News) Japan is an island nation, and its people are naturally skilled in swimming. If you browse through the world swimming records, the 100-meter and 200-meter swims were once held by Japanese swimmer Jiang, and the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststrokes were created by the current Tsuruta. Japan's position in the world of swimming can be imagined. Recently, it also plans to win the world championship, so it recruited the American team, the world swimming champion, to Japan for a trial. As a result, the elite American athletes were defeated by the two Japanese teenagers, Yokoyama, 18, and Makino, 16, in the long-distance swimming competition. With a difference of 17 points, the American team returned in disgrace. The American swimming champion at next year's 10th World Games is in danger. Driven by the ambition to win the championship, Japan has been actively promoting this sport recently. On the 15th and 16th of this month, the All-Japan Women's Swimming Championships were held at the Meiji Jingu Swimming Pool in Tokyo. The attendees were athletes from all prefectures of Japan. As a result, five new championship records were created, and four Japanese national records were broken. The 100-meter freestyle performance was the best, at only 1 minute and 18.6 seconds. Ordinary men will also be left behind. The results of each event are listed below:</p>

<p>Result is One to Three</p>
<p>Tense Situation in Today's Singles</p>

<p>Defries (Canada) 6-3 Qiu Feihai (China)</p>
<p>Lett 6-2 Jiang Daozhang</p>
<p>6-4</p>
<p>China and Canada, competing fiercely in the complex tournament, each won a singles match, creating a stalemate. Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, the doubles match was held. The Chinese duo of Qiu and Jiang, with their hearts full of hope, suffered a 1-3 defeat, which was beyond the expectations of anyone among the hundreds of spectators present. Is this intentional to create a tense atmosphere for today's efforts in the last two singles matches? However, this is not the case, and the difference will be seen again on the court today.</p>
<p>Timely Rescue Canada's Defries served three aces in a row, shocking the entire court. Qiu made several smooth shots, all hitting the key points, turning the score into a 3-3 tie. Jiang Daozhang added two more powerful shots, winning a game, which was exhilarating. The Canadian team took the lead with a net attack, making the score 2-1. Qiu's serve, soft yet powerful, resulted in a 2-2 tie. Each side won a game, making the match dull and lifeless. In the seventh and eighth games, the Chinese team suddenly gained a significant advantage, conquering the opponent and making the score 5-3. Qiu's shot lacked power, and Jiang's weakness was exposed, and a 5-5 tie suddenly occurred. Qiu and Jiang rose in time, and their steps were aligned, their shots were wonderful. The first set was thus saved, winning with a score of 7-5. Amazing Performance According to the experts prediction, the Canadian team's performance in the first set was not very outstanding. Based on this, it is not difficult to predict the outcome of the second and third sets. However, hard work and struggle allowed the Canadian team to turn the tide, turning defeat into victory. Their strategy of using their strengths to attack the opponent's weaknesses was highly effective. After the second set, Jiang Daozhang almost became the target of the opposing team's attacks. A slight carelessness would be exploited. Qiu Feihai lost his usual strength, and everything went wrong, as if under a curse. In the sixth game of the second set, Lett dove to save a ball, which would be impossible for someone who is not good at soccer. This victory made the score 4-2, and the 6-3 victory came from this. The third set showed no skills from Qiu and Jiang. However, Defries and Lett's amazing performances were constantly discovered, and the outcome of the victory or defeat was predictable. In the fourth set, the two sides held on for a long time. When China was at a disadvantage with a score of 3-5, the audience was extremely anxious. Applause in waves, hoping to show the strength of our army and overcome the strong enemy. As hoped, the score became 4-5, and hope was gradually born. Defries served, taking the opportunity to go straight in, and finally won the fourth set with a score of 6-4.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Cables Zhejiang Province to Lift the Ban on Grain</h3>
<p>To Save the Food Panic of Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Zhejiang Provincial Government to lift the ban on grain leaving the province to save the food panic of Jiangsu Province. The original text is recorded as follows: "To the esteemed Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou: Regarding the circulation of food, the National Government has repeatedly issued clear orders, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies to meet demand, which is the key to providing food to the people. In previous years, Zhejiang Province purchased and transported grain in Shanghai without restriction. This is because Zhejiang Province is not an abundant production area, and Shanghai rice merchants have done their best to provide food to Zhejiang Province. Last year, the autumn harvest was excellent everywhere, and a large amount of Wanxian rice was gathered to thousands of ships due to the Datongsheng rice donation issue. This spring, they were released and sold in Ningzhen, Wuxi, and other places, and the rest were transferred through Taihu Lake to Zhejiang, hoarding in Heshshi and other places, with about 200,000 stored in warehouses to date. Recently, due to large-scale floods in various places, Shanghai's source of supply is lacking, and rice prices are soaring. Rice merchants believe that the official price limit is not a good policy for price stabilization, so they are actively dredging the source and trying to adjust. However, Hengdaxin Rice Shop in this city recently purchased 1,500 shi of Wanxian rice stored earlier from Gongtaixing Rice Shop in Heshshi and was suddenly detained, preventing loading and transporting. Many others have been detained, saying that they were ordered by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to prohibit leaving the province. It is found that this Wanxian rice was originally transported from Jiangsu to Zhejiang. Regardless of this year's famine, it is definitely not enough to rely on this small amount. Even in normal years, Zhejiang Province relies on imports from Jiangsu and Shanghai to survive. However, if a province that cannot supply itself implements restrictions on leaving the province, and neighboring provinces follow suit, is it not a self-defeating policy? In previous years, Jiangsu Province banned leaving the province and set up grain inspection stations, causing great panic in Zhejiang Province. Shanghai rice merchants made every effort to plead for the people of Zhejiang, which proves that they are unwilling to see disasters in neighboring provinces. This is also a lack of morality. The people of Zhejiang and Shanghai are as close as brothers and sisters, and this boundary is not appropriate for politics. Although the disaster is present this year, the extent cannot be determined until the autumn harvest. However, due to Zhejiang's limited production, it cannot permanently cut off Shanghai's transit supply. Therefore, we specifically request your association to forward this letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, canceling the previous order prohibiting leaving the province, and instructing the Haining County Government to quickly approve the release of the transported rice to maintain domestic circulation and supply and demand. The future of food is truly relied upon. Sincerely, the County Industry Department." It is found that the public association stated that Zhejiang's food supply has always relied on Jiangsu and Shanghai, and whether or not they communicate, they benefit from each other. Once the boundaries are divided, Jiangsu and Zhejiang will both suffer. Understanding the situation over the years, it is not without reason. Moreover, the goods detained by Hengdaxin Rice Shop in Heshshi were originally Wanxian rice, which was transferred from Jiangsu to Zhejiang and stored in warehouses for sale. The situation is even different from that of Zhejiang rice being transported out of the province. This year, water flooded the fields. According to newspaper reports, Jiangsu Province occupies a larger area than Zhejiang Province. That is, the disaster situation is more serious in Jiangsu and less serious in Zhejiang. The food panic in Shanghai is also more severe than in Zhejiang. It is reasonable to report the situation and request your government to examine it, and normally lift the ban, instructing the Haining County Government to quickly release the detained rice so that it can be transported to Shanghai for relief. It is for the public good. County Property Department.</p>
<h3>Fundraising to Purchase and Store Rice</h3>
<p>Regarding the accumulation of grain in Shanghai County, since the restoration, there has long been the name of accumulating grain without the reality of accumulating grain. During the Qi Lu War, there was more than 100,000 yuan in cash under the accumulation of grain item, which was taken for military use and has not been returned to date. Therefore, it is quite difficult to reorganize it. Now, Magistrate Yan, in view of the floods occurring in various places, the small number of wheat and rice sources, and the soaring rice prices, should the autumn harvest be barren again, the people's food will inevitably be affected. He should plan ahead and properly remedy the situation to maintain the people's livelihood. The Property Department received an official letter from the county government yesterday, trying to raise funds, inspect the city situation, and purchase rice for storage in case of emergency.</p>
<p>British Public Bus</p>
<h3>Drivers May Join Ticket Collectors</h3>
<p>Company Tries to Ease Tension</p>
<p>Union's Attitude Remains Firm</p>
<p>Following the strike of all ticket collectors at the British-owned Public Omnibus Company, the company declared a special holiday yesterday, and all bus routes were completely suspended. The terms of employment have not yet been negotiated, and a resolution is difficult to reach in the short term. Today, ticket inspectors will continue to perform the duties of ticket collectors and make a partial opening of routes 1, 2, 5, and 9. However, it is rumored that drivers will also join the strike. The strike committee will hold a general meeting today. The details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yesterday, Complete Suspension: After the company announced a special holiday yesterday, all drivers, ticket inspectors, ticket writers, and junior workers did not report for duty. Routes within the Public Concession, including Route 1 from Jing'an Temple to the Gongyuan Bazi Chang (shooting range), Route 2 from Eryangjing Bridge to the Gongyuan Bazi Chang, Route 3 from Caojiadu to Zhoujiaqiao, Route 5 from Sanmaoge Bridge to the North Railway Station, Route 6 from Tilanqiao to the Bazi Chang, Route 7 from Caojiadu to Nanyang University, Route 8 from Jing'an Temple Road to the Power Plant, and Route 10 from Caodu to Yinxiang Township, were completely suspended. Passengers found this quite inconvenient. As a result, streetcar passengers were more crowded than usual, and rickshaw pullers profited threefold.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting: Ticket collectors and drivers of the Public Omnibus Company held an emergency joint meeting at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss how to deal with the company's refusal to negotiate terms of employment. It was decided that all 200-plus drivers would join the strike in support of the ticket collectors and act in unison. Upon learning of this, the company granted a special holiday yesterday in an attempt to ease tensions. However, the strike committee remained very firm and continued to contact drivers individually to encourage them to join the strike.</p>
<p>Today's General Meeting: The British-owned Public Omnibus Workers' Strike Committee, due to the company's refusal to negotiate the nine terms of employment and its actions to hire new ticket collectors, has decided to convene a general meeting of all ticket collectors this morning to discuss specific countermeasures. It is reported that driver representatives will also participate.</p>
<p>Workers' Attitude: According to a declaration by the strike committee yesterday, all workers, due to their demands for improved treatment and opposition to the company's unwarranted dismissal of workers, have resorted to a strike after unsuccessful negotiations. Now that the company refuses to negotiate, causing delays in resolving the matter, all workers should insist on continuing the strike and vow not to return to work until their goals are achieved. As for those who violate the strike discipline, measures will be taken to deal with them severely.</p>

<p>National Goods Factories United Association</p>
<h3>Inquiry Regarding Methods of Distinguishing Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories United Association received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Association inquiring about methods of distinguishing Japanese goods. The letter stated: "We previously received a letter from your association stating that you planned to compile and publish national goods trademarks for inspection purposes, which demonstrates a patriotic zeal unmatched throughout the country. Our association expresses its deepest admiration. Since our association began operations on the 10th of this month, we have been actively carrying out anti-Japanese work. However, while our association's inspection team members have experience in identifying Japanese goods, they often encounter numerous difficulties due to the complexity of merchants' labels. Therefore, we are writing to request that your association promptly send us two copies of the instruction manual on trademarks of national goods factories that you have compiled, or, if you have not yet compiled and cannot send it down, please provide us with a brief explanation of how to distinguish Japanese goods in advance to facilitate our work and ensure that those who sell and transport Japanese goods do not escape the net."</p>
<p>After the Issuance of Silk Public Bonds</p>
<h3>Status of Silk Factories' Resumption of Operations</h3>
<p>The stimulus portion of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry public bonds, rumored for over a year, amounting to over four million yuan, has been reviewed and finalized by the Ministries of Finance and Industry. The Silk Industry Public Bond Execution Committee has been ordered to distribute the bonds to silk factories in the Shanghai, Wuxi, and Zhejiang areas according to the allocation standards for silk reeling machines, with each factory receiving its share separately. However, after receiving the public bonds, each factory should immediately prepare for work to maintain the livelihoods of its workers. According to investigations, among the 106 silk factories in Shanghai, due to the sluggish sales of foreign silk thread when the new silkworm cocoons were launched this year, the price of local silk thread was low, and the working capital of each factory was tight, many factories reduced production or suspended operations. Before the summer break, only 36 silk factories were operating. Now that the issuance of silk public bonds is imminent, all factories that have suspended operations are currently hiring craftsmen to repair machinery and purchase raw materials, preparing to start up the machines as soon as they receive the public bonds. It is estimated that after the public bonds are issued, two-thirds of all silk factories in Shanghai will be able to resume operations.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Entrusts Accountants</p>
<h3>To Re-Investigate Losses of National Products Market</h3>
<p>After the National Products Market on Nanjing Road was illegally closed by the Public Works Department, accountant Tong Shiwen estimated the losses and reported them to the municipal government. The municipal government entrusted the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to review the assessment, and now accountants Xi Yushu, Tao Senjie, and Chen Chaolun are jointly auditing the losses. They are actively handling the matter, and as soon as the investigation is completed, they will report back to the municipal government to facilitate negotiations with the Public Works Department.</p>

<h3>Yellow Powder Suffocates Many People</h3>
<p>Brought by Italian Mail Ship</p>
<p>One Worker Has Died</p>
<p>The Italian mail ship [blank space] managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. entered the port at 6:30 AM the day before yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf on Huaji Road. Yesterday morning, the company's warehouse clerk, along with several junior workers, went on board to unload cargo. Unexpectedly, a yellow powder resembling pigment suddenly emitted a strange odor. Instantly, all the junior workers who inhaled the odor fainted and fell to the ground. Their faces immediately turned yellow, and their noses turned grayish-white. All of them lost consciousness. More than twenty people were suffocated. Onlookers were horrified at the sight and immediately ran to inform Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., who in turn notified the fire brigade. Several ambulances were dispatched to transport all the unconscious workers to Tongren Hospital, Baolong Hospital, the Red Cross Hospital, and other hospitals.

<h3>The Future Prosperity of Laoximen</h3>
<p>Actively Working on Heping Road</p>
<p>Major Merchants Establish Department Store</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government has been actively transforming the old city area, the Dongmen Road in the South Shanghai urban area has already been successfully transformed, and the market has suddenly become prosperous, presenting a new look. Currently, the construction and planning of Laoximen are underway, with Yilong Lane being converted into Heping Road, so that Lafayette Road and Zhaojia Road in Laoximen are connected east and west to form a major avenue. At present, the houses in Yilong Lane are being demolished. The municipal buildings from Jingjiang Gongsu on Fangxie Road to Wansheng Road, as well as the municipal buildings along the streetcar station on Zhonghua Road, have also been fenced off with bamboo fences and demolition work has begun. The municipal buildings south of the Memorial Tower will also be demolished. It is rumored that major merchants have already raised funds to build a five-story building in the area to open a large-scale department store, which can rival the Fu'an Company on Dongmen Road, shining east and west. It is said that the new construction project will definitely be completed by the spring and summer of next year, becoming the only central location in the west of the city. Even the Yangmeiqiao area may become a bustling market.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Pilgrimage Group Returns to China</h3>
<p>Preparing to Hold Exhibition of Journey's Achievements</p>
<p>Location Set at Local Yousheng Travel Group</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Pilgrimage Group, led by Shi Bei Guan and others, departed from Shanghai last September and traveled to various places in Southeast Asia and India. After nearly a year, the group passed through Xiamen, Shantou, Chaozhou, Guangzhou, Vietnam, Siam, Johor, Singapore, Selangor, Penang, Myanmar, India, and other places, covering a journey of over 10,000 li. When the group passed through Siam, they were introduced by Xiao Focheng, the former Overseas Minister of our country, and once paid respects to the Sangharaja (Supreme Patriarch of Siamese Buddhism), receiving gracious treatment. The Sangharaja specially bestowed a Tripitaka (Buddhist scriptures) in Pali and granted the monastic names to Bei Guan and Ti Can. The emotional bond between Buddhism in China and Siam was thus fully established. Their travels in the Malay States and Myanmar were praised by commentators along the way. Various social organizations and schools invited them to give lectures, and overseas Buddhist groups expressed welcome. In every place they visited, prominent social figures competed to present inscriptions and lavish praise. When Bei Guan arrived in India, he personally visited various sacred sites such as Buddhagaya, the Bodhi tree, Vulture Peak, and Zhengjue Mountain. In addition to investigating Buddhism and collecting Buddhist items, they also diligently observed other religions in India (such as Hinduism and Islam), politics, education, law, people's thoughts, lifestyles, habits, and the situation of our overseas Chinese. During their two months in India, they met with Chinese artists Gao Jianwen, Dr. Kunhua Liu Renhang, Tibetan Commissioner Tan Yunshan, and Pan Demin of the Asia Walking Group, and had a very pleasant time. Afterwards, they returned to Siam to fulfill their appointment with the Sangharaja and studied Pali and Siamese culture in Siamese Buddhism, receiving generous treatment from the Sangharaja. This time, they returned to China to visit their ordination master and because they were excessively fatigued from their travels and suffered from insomnia, deafness, and other ailments and urgently needed rest. When they arrived in Shantou, they sent a telegram to Huang Jingwan and others. They arrived in Shanghai on the 19th of this month by ship and are staying at the Ping'an Hotel No. 118 in this city. Cai Xueyuan, a Chinese industrialist from Siam, also came with them. When Bei Guan disembarked, he and Cai visited Huang Jingwan. Huang expressed a warm welcome and hosted a banquet at Gongdelin at noon to welcome Bei Huan and Cai Xueyuan, inviting Ms. Yu Yixuan, a musician from Shanghai, and others to accompany them. The conversation during the banquet was mostly in the new language of the South, and the guests and hosts were very happy. After the banquet, they were invited to visit the Yousheng Travel Group. It is reported that Bei Guan said that the group's travel work has now come to an end, and everyone is making efforts in academics, hoping not to fail this trip. It is also reported that the group is preparing to hold an exhibition of the situation during the year and the various Buddhist items collected at the Yousheng Travel Group in this city, and to print a travel commemorative publication.</p>
<h3>Dangerous Sea Dike Outside Songkou</h3>
<p>The sea dike in the areas of Shizi Township, Xuejiatan, Huiyuan Township, and Huangyaowan in Baoshan County, northeast of Wusong Fort, has been damaged by wind and rain. All the piles and stones have been completely loosened, and the earthworks have collapsed by 70-80% due to continuous impact by the raging tide, so it is in a dangerous state. The villagers along the dike are panicked. If it collapses during the autumn high tide, the villages along the dike will become flooded, and the lives and fields will be unimaginable. Pu Weirun, the district chief of the fifth district, reported the situation to Zhao, the county magistrate of Baoshan County, who immediately forwarded a letter to the Jiangnan Dike Engineering Office, ordering personnel to conduct an on-site inspection and carry out emergency repairs to prevent the disaster. At the same time, he reported the situation to the provincial authorities and requested a large sum of money to be allocated for the survey and repair to ensure permanent stability and protect the lives of the people.</p>

<p>In the Bigamy Lawsuit, the</p>
<h3>Question of the Identities of the Man and Woman</h3>
<p>Must First Be Filed with the Civil Court</p>
<p>Fang Huang, a woman residing at No. 1714, Renji Lane, Xinzha Road, recently hired female lawyer Shi Liang and lawyer Shen Zengkuan to file a private prosecution in the First Special District Court against her husband, Fang Qingkui, a local resident, aged 53 (Yitai Xiang Department Store, No. 1035 Maigen Road), for bigamy and abandonment. The previous morning, Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. According to Fang Huang's complaint, she married the defendant at the age of 26 and was initially unaware that he already had a wife. They lived together for ten years and had a son, who is now three years old. However, in the past three months, the defendant has completely stopped coming home, ignoring daily expenses, and has abandoned her. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit demanding alimony of over 80,000 yuan. When questioned, Fang Qingkui claimed that he and the plaintiff were not husband and wife and had no relationship. He said that they met and became acquainted while playing, and he had no knowledge of the child she claimed to have had. He also hired lawyer Li Xinhong to defend him in court. After reviewing the statements, Judge Feng ruled that since the identities of the plaintiff and defendant had not yet been determined, the case could not proceed. Therefore, the case should first be filed with the Civil Court to determine the identities. He then ordered the defendant to leave, and the trial was suspended.</p>
<h3>Severe Maid Abuse Fractures Wooden Rod</h3>
<p>Wang Yonghua Hospitalized for Treatment</p>
<p>Yu Meijun Posts 600 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM on the 21st of this month, a young woman was seen crying along the road at the intersection of Seymour Road and Edinburgh Road, covered in blood. Chinese Constable No. 329 from the Jing'an Temple Police Station saw her and questioned her. According to the woman, named Wang Yonghua, 16 years old, from Tianjin, she was a maid at the residence of Yu Meijun, a woman from Wuxi, at No. 1236, Wende Lane, Edinburgh Road. Last night and this morning, she was beaten twice with a wooden rod by her mistress for no reason, so she ran away. The constable took the woman to the police station and transferred her to Renji Hospital. After examination, the doctor found that Wang had lost a lot of blood and was seriously injured and needed to be hospitalized. The police chief was informed and sent detective Zhao Zifang to arrest Yu Meijun, along with the broken wooden rod, and took her to the women's prison. The previous morning, she was escorted to the Summary Court of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, presented the case, stating that the victim, Wang Yonghua, was unable to appear in court due to her serious injuries in the hospital and requested a postponement. He also presented the wooden rod as evidence. When questioned, the defendant, Yu Meijun, claimed that she used to work as a telephone operator at the Nanshi Telephone Bureau but had since resigned. She said that she brought Wang, then ten years old, from Tianjin to raise her as an adopted daughter for six years and had never abused her. Recently, due to her bad behavior, stealing items, refusing to work, and saying hurtful things, she became angry and struck her buttocks with a wooden rod. However, she accidentally hit the handrail, causing the wooden rod to break. She also hired a lawyer to appear in court and requested bail. After reviewing the statements, Judge Cheng Shangfeng ordered the defendant to post 600 yuan bail and postponed the hearing for seven days, waiting for Wang Yonghua to recover from her injuries before further questioning.</p>
<h3>Abductor Claims to Be the Boy's Uncle</h3>
<p>The Abducted Boy's Testimony</p>
<p>The water police detective recently arrested Chen Wenbo, an abductor, on the Songshan Maru ship. Chen was carrying Zhang Xiyong, a nine-year-old boy, planning to sell him in Xiamen, Shantou, and other places. The police station transferred them to the District Court yesterday, where Prosecutor Yang held a preliminary hearing. According to the abducted Zhang Xiyong's testimony, he is nine years old, from Suzhou, and lives in Luyongfang, Yanmen, Suzhou. His father, Zhang Zhifang, is a doctor, and his brother, Xijing, runs a cigarette and paper shop. Ten days ago, he was sleeping on a long bench in a pawnshop when the defendant came and gave him melon seeds to eat. After eating them, he followed the defendant. That night, they took a car to Shanghai and stayed in a hotel in Nanshi. The defendant had an accomplice who had already returned to Suzhou. The defendant then took him on a ship, saying they were going to Shantou. He completely took off his clothes and put him in a set of blue cloth shorts and a shirt and a pair of cloth shoes, ordering him to call him uncle. Chen Wenbo claimed that his father told him to take him out to learn carpentry. The detective stated that since one said he was the uncle and the other said he was going to learn carpentry, there was a discrepancy, so they were arrested. The judge questioned the defendant again, and the defendant asked for leniency. The judge then ordered the defendant to be detained, and the child was sent to the Relief Society to be taken care of, waiting for his family to claim him.</p>
<h3>Ren Zhennan's Lewdness Case - False Accusation Hearing</h3>
<p>Ren Is Not in Shanghai and Cannot Be Summoned</p>
<p>Lawyer Ren Zhennan, after being accused of fraud by Ningbo merchant Zhuang Chunfu, was further accused by his newlywed wife, Jiang Xingjuan, of illegal sexual relations that caused injury to her anus. As a result, the Lawyers Association reported Ren's expulsion from the association, forcing him into a desperate situation. Therefore, Ren has returned to his hometown and no longer practices law. However, Ren has filed a countersuit for false accusation against his wife, Jiang Xingjuan. The District Court prosecutor has summoned him twice, but since Ren is not in Shanghai, he cannot be summoned. Still heading to the original place to negotiate, at that time Cui still hired Wang Shaoqing to reach the pre-arranged location and waited again. Wang arrived at the destination, but saw that the surrounding area was desolate, and the time was late, and the cool wind was chilling. Before long, a person with a pockmarked face wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers came over and stared at Wang for a long time, then stepped forward and whispered, "What are you doing here?" Wang replied, "I am a friend of the Cui family and came here by special appointment." The man said, "I was ordered by the old master to come here to negotiate, but I don't know what this is all about." Wang replied, "The amount of 1,000 yuan is too much, Cui has insufficient funds, can you please reduce it?" The man initially pretended to disagree, but after repeated discussions, he reduced it to 400 yuan. The man said, "This is the lowest amount. If you reduce it by another penny, our old master will definitely not agree." They then made an appointment to negotiate again at the same place at 8:00 PM the previous night. The day before, Cui took the original two letters and reported them to the First District Headquarters, requesting their arrest. The Headquarters first ordered Cui's friend, Wang Shaoqing, to go to the appointment and wait, and then dispatched Detective Leader Dong Pengde and detectives Yuan Haishan and others to rush to the place to make the arrest. When Wang arrived at the place, he saw the pockmarked man come to meet him again, saying, "If you report this to the police district, I can immediately present you with a pistol." Wang shook his head repeatedly to indicate no. At this time, the detectives had arrived by car and were able to arrest the man and take him back for preliminary hearing. The man confessed his name as Xie Yuqing, 26 years old, originally from Andong, residing in Yangjiadu, Pudong, where he worked as a laborer. He said that this matter was entrusted to him by Wang Ba, a Qingjiang person residing in Seymour Road, North City. Then Wang Ba was arrested at his address. According to Wang Ba's confession, the matter was masterminded by Bai Jianren, who entrusted him to send the letter for negotiation, which he did not agree to. Therefore, he entrusted Xie to handle it. When they went to arrest Bai Jianren, he had already fled upon hearing the news. Since the matter involved blackmail, they were ordered to prepare documents and send all the people to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Huang Jinrong's Stance on the Wei Case</h3>
<p>Zhao Weixian, the mastermind behind the abduction of Wei Tingrong, was arrested in Suzhou the day before yesterday. The details have been reported in various newspapers. However, some reports stated that when Zhao was detained in the Suzhou Detective Team, as many as sixteen people went to the Public Security Bureau to request bail for Zhao, mostly local gentry. However, the Suzhou Public Security Bureau, on the recommendation of a letter from Huang Jinrong, a famous figure in Shanghai, strictly refused to grant bail to Zhao. Therefore, Zhao was finally escorted to Shanghai by car at 4:50 PM. Yesterday, the reporter visited Huang Jinrong at his residence. According to him (Huang), "I (Huang himself) am currently a senior advisor to the French Concession Police, and it is my responsibility to thoroughly understand the case of Wei's abduction. Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to refuse the request for bail for Zhao in Suzhou."</p>

Now, seeing that his daughter-in-law had returned to Ningbo and had not returned for days, in order to promote family harmony, he did not hesitate to travel to Ningbo to sincerely welcome his daughter-in-law back to Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and after returning home, Wang happened to return to his residence after work. Seeing his wife's return to Shanghai, he was even more unusually angry, not uttering a word. After Wang took a bath, he went to bed.

<h3>Fourth Report on Cholera Prevention</h3>
<p>Four Cholera Patients Recovered</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Lien-teh of the Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office issued his fourth report on the 22nd, stating: 1. During the past week, four cases of cholera confirmed by bacteria were discovered in Shanghai. Two of them lived in Hongkou, one in Nanshi, and one in Pudong. Fortunately, the symptoms were mild. After being injected with saline solution in the hospital, they all recovered. None of the four had received cholera vaccinations, which indicates that the scattered cases in various districts of Shanghai are not related to each other. 2. Dr. Yang of the Central Hygiene Laboratory reported that after examining well water from various locations in the Huangpu River, Suzhou Creek, Pudong, and Nanshi, he found more than 20 types of "anti-cholera bacteriophages," which is the first discovery of Oriental "cholera bacteriophages." Several Japanese experimentalists spent several years trying to find such "bacteriophages" in Japan but failed. According to Professor De Herelle, a French scholar, the special value of this substance is that if this "bacteriophage" is applied to cholera-affected areas, it can stop the cholera epidemic in that area. Dr. Yang plans to include his main research in the next report, which readers can pay attention to in the next issue. 3. The expanded cholera vaccination program is still being implemented in various parts of the Chinese Concession and will be summarized in a general report at the end of this month. 4. The cholera outbreak in Zhoupu seems to have ended. As of yesterday, 9,923 people in the area have received cholera vaccinations. The population of the area is 14,000. Ships arriving in Shanghai are still being inspected at the Wusongkou. From the 15th to the 20th of this month, 4,840 passengers have been vaccinated. 5. Since the flood in Hankou, quite a few people have come to Shanghai to take refuge. The health authorities are working together to plan relief efforts to prevent the spread of various dangerous infectious diseases into Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Report on Good Deeds of Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall</h3>
<p>The Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall on Ningbo Road in the French Concession has been providing coffins and burying exposed coffins and corpses of children year-round. From July 1 of last year to the end of June of the 20th year (1931), all the undertakings and income and expenditure for the entire year of the 19th year are hereby published in the newspaper, which is expected to be welcomed by philanthropists. (1) Under the item of coffin donation, the hall gave out 742 large coffins, estimated to cost 3,710 yuan in labor and materials, 12 five-foot coffins, costing 30 yuan in labor and materials, 111 four-foot coffins, costing 222 yuan in labor and materials, 482 three-foot coffins, costing 771 yuan in labor and materials, and 495 two-foot coffins, costing 495 yuan in labor and materials. (2) Under the item of burial, 743 large coffins, three water transport numbers, costing 105 yuan in transportation fees, 2,442 medium coffins, costing 342 yuan in transportation fees, and 1,931 small coffins, costing 135 yuan in transportation fees. (3) Under the item of 窀棺, 43 regular lacquer coffins were given away, with a subsidy of 4 yuan per coffin, totaling 172 yuan. 91 deputy coffins were given away, with a subsidy of 5 yuan per coffin, totaling 455 yuan. In addition, other expenses such as vehicles and equipment added to the autopsy site, as well as supplies for collecting corpses, totaled approximately 340 yuan. Salaries, hard work, and meals totaled 2,700 yuan, and postal and telecommunications consumption and miscellaneous expenses totaled 420 yuan. The total expenditure for the year was 9,947 yuan, nearly ten thousand yuan. Fortunately, thanks to the generous donations from local philanthropists, such as the monthly donation of 720 yuan per year from the former French Concession Council, monthly donations of 95 yuan from various philanthropists, annual donations of 113 yuan, special donations of 300 yuan from Wu Ruirui Hall and anonymous donors, a special donation of 111 yuan from Guo Huangshi of Robinson Road, Hong Kong, and 283 yuan from various philanthropists, the total income was 1,922 yuan. The subsidies for coffin prices from the French Concession Public Works Bureau and the special donations from the French Municipal Council were all collected by charitable organizations and are therefore not included. The difference between the total income and expenditure for the year was approximately 8,000 yuan, which was generally allocated by the Tongren Fuyuan General Hall. In recent years, the French Concession has become vast and densely populated, and the undertakings of the hall have increased year by year, and the expenses have also increased accordingly. It is hoped that benevolent benefactors and believers will provide sincere advice from time to time to encourage its development as much as possible. The merit is immeasurable. In the future, families who accumulate good deeds will surely have surplus blessings, and the health and good fortune of all benefactors can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Young Girl Lu Amao to Become International Merchandise</h3>
<p>Fortunately Rescued by the Tzu Erh Hui (Orphanage)</p>
<p>The girl Lu Amao, 13 years old, is from Changle Town, Chongming. Her parents are dead, and she has no brothers or sisters, only a younger brother, who has been adopted by others. A few days ago, her uncle sold her to Wu Mengliang, a Fujianese, at No. 16 Shengjili, outside Dadongmen, Shanghai, for 145 yuan. After staying for a few days, he planned to sell her to Japan. He was preparing clothes and preparing to export her when the Chinese Children's Welfare Association suddenly received a report from a sympathizer. They immediately sent the protection department official Wang Guanyi, along with Police Officer Yan from the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to investigate. They inquired with Wu Mengliang's wife, Wu Bushi, (at that time, Wu Mengliang was out). Due to language barriers, it was impossible to know the truth. They turned to the girl Lu Xiang Amao to inquire. According to her account, she was indeed sold to Shanghai and was about to be sold to Japan as an adopted daughter. They took Wu Bushi and Lu Amao to the First District and, after questioning, believed that they were trafficking in people. They prepared a document and sent it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and after questioning by the Third Section, they designated Wu Bushi as a suspected human trafficker and prepared a document to send to the Shanghai Local Court for legal action.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the news in your newspaper today (August 23) about the district chief beating a shop employee. The news is not factual, so I especially want to state as below. On the afternoon of the 18th of this month, District Chief Wu, due to the fact that the shops in Minhang arbitrarily piled up debris in the road, which was unsightly, went to each house to persuade them. The Yi Changxing shop, which was recently opened, piled up two large barrels of asphalt in the road, and the persuasion was ineffective, and they gave rude words, so he immediately sent them to the police and took them back to the Public Security Bureau and gave them a mild punishment. There was a dispute, and then it calmed down immediately. The next day, the Chamber of Commerce convened a general meeting of members, and the number of members present did not meet the legal number and the resolution was false according to the regulations, and there was no resolution to remove the non-Dadao from office. In addition to reporting the details to the county government in advance, I am deeply afraid that the rumors are false and confuse the news, so I especially ask your newspaper to correct it. To the Shenbao, from the Shanghai County First District Public Office, August 23.</p>

<p>Money is the root of all evil. However, when money enters the hands of a gentleman, it can help him become a good person. When it enters the hands of a villain, it is enough to help him with his evil deeds. Money is not evil, but it must be used properly.</p>

<h3>Teachers Should Be Interviewed for Registration</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education is conducting elementary school teacher registration. It has been held once a year for four sessions. August 17th and 18th are the dates for teacher interviews. The location is in the Bureau of Education. Young men and women braved the heat from all directions. Gathering together is quite a sight. I hereby record its outline as follows.</p>
<p>Stuttering Unstoppable In the past, Jia Changsha and others paid attention to the Crown Prince Grand Tutor. Education is the foundation of a country. According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, today's little citizens are all princes. How can the teachers of young citizens be ignored? Therefore, elementary school teacher registration is important. The purpose of registration is to identify. In previous registrations, only a certificate, two forms, and three photos were required. Now, for the sake of solemnity, we will change course. In addition to physical examination, there is also an interview. The interview is conducted by two divisions in the Bureau of Education. Each group consists of two people. Those who are timid often have gray faces and white lips. Stuttering is unstoppable. They all say that those who sit on the cold bench will be more difficult year after year.</p>
<p>Lack of Common Sense There are five categories in the interview. Thought, language, attitude, experience, and common sense. Someone asked who the current Minister of Education is, who the director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education is, how many municipal schools there are in Shanghai, what the purpose of Chinese education is, how many national education conferences have been held since the establishment of the national government, and what the difference is between national education and mass education. There are quite a few people who are surprised and cannot answer. Someone asked who the current leader of Russia is and in which country the Third International is implemented. Those who cannot answer are uneasy, thinking that they will fail. In fact, it is fortunate that they did not answer, otherwise their thoughts will attract the attention of the people in the bureau. A teacher wearing a Western suit with no tie or collar showed his shirt hanging out over his pants. The critic saw it and immediately issued an eviction order. After begging repeatedly, I don't know what the result was.</p>
<p>More Monks Than Rice In Shanghai, the first teacher registration had 462 people. The second session had 747 people. The third session reached 758 people. This time there are 633 people. The total is 2,598 people. There are only 185 municipal elementary schools. The total number of teachers is 1,066. The total number of registered teachers is more than two and a half times. Still holding a regret. Supply exceeds demand. This is the case everywhere in China today. The education sector is still second. Last season, there were 17.5 million children in school in Soviet Russia and 900,000 teachers. Compared with the imperial system, when there were only 7 million students and 500,000 teachers at most, the difference is more than double. It can be seen that national unity, national defense, and production development are urgent.</p>
<h3>Soul Bed</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Philosophers explain the soul as a spiritual entity outside the body. Generally superstitious religious people have the theory of the immortality of the soul. However, Confucian scholars often refuted it. As Sima Wengong said, "The body is decayed and the spirit is scattered." The spirit is the so-called soul. Recently, German medical doctor Mike Qidu has invented a soul bed that can weigh the soul. This is also amazing. The doctor is in charge of a large hospital and specially made a bed with the function of weighing. Patients groan on it and can know the increase or decrease of their disease by the weight of their body. The method is very convenient. One day, the doctor was in the isolation room, examining a dying patient. Just as he was examining, a patient suddenly died. The patient was lying on the weighing bed. As soon as a person died, the number of pounds suddenly decreased. The doctor then studied it and knew that people rely on breathing to live. Each breath contains a certain amount of moisture. When breathing stops, moisture disappears, and the number of pounds should naturally decrease. But it is not as different as it is. Therefore, the doctor decided that the amount of sudden reduction, in addition to moisture, is the dissolution of the soul. From then on, the weight of the soul can be measured on this bed after repeated tests. The name of the soul bed has caused a sensation in Western Europe for a time. Hospitals are currently rushing to imitate it.</p>
<h3>North Station Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Since the Song case, the security of the two roads has become more strict. There were three doors on the east, west, and south sides that could be used to enter and exit. Now the west-facing door has been locked. During the day, only the east and south doors are open. At night, the south door is also closed tightly. Only the main entrance is open. At each entrance, there must be three to five soldiers and police officers. There are soldiers from the Security Command, police officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and road police from the two roads. Passengers carrying bags must be inspected before entering the station. A certain person was rushing to Beijing. When he arrived at the station, it was only five minutes before the train was scheduled to depart. He planned to buy a ticket and board the train calmly. However, the soldiers and police ordered an inspection, turning over boxes and cabinets for a long time before stopping. When he entered the station, the train had already gone far away. He couldn't help but feel frustrated. In addition to inspecting luggage, passengers are also searched. Its strictness can be known. Since Guo Chengen took over as the director, in order to punish the past and prevent future, he has set up a special committee to discuss the protection methods for important people entering and leaving the station. It is also important to block hidden dangers.</p>
<p>Station fraud cases are endless. Previously, a woman was sitting and waiting for a car with two bags. Suddenly, a person came and sat beside her. Before long, he said to the woman, "I'll be back soon. Please watch the bags for me." The woman agreed. Sure enough, a person came in similar clothes. He hurriedly took the suitcase and left. The woman didn't think much of it. After a while, the original owner returned and asked in surprise where the belongings were. He immediately twisted the woman and ordered compensation. The woman was terrified and cried. After Lu Zhonglian came out to mediate, the woman paid ten oceans. In fact, all three people were in the same party. The calculation is also cunning.</p>
<p>When the Song case occurred, bullets flew horizontally. To this day, there are still many relics in the hall. Many huge pillars have been pierced. The gun holes have not been repaired. Passengers entering the station must touch the pillars for a moment to imagine the situation that day. He was still trembling with fear. Song was able to escape danger also due to God's blessing.</p>
<h3>A Record of Du Liyun and Her Records</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom House Master</p>
<p>In recent years, the Peking Opera world has been full of vitality. From silence, it has returned to splendor. There are also Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, and women include Huang (Xueyanqin), Wang (Xinyanqiu), Du (Liyun), and Zhang (Eyun). They compete in beauty and have their own considerable momentum. The good people pushed the wave and established parties and societies. There is no end to the competition. This is certainly good news for the promotion of drama. It is also a good phenomenon of national singing and dancing.</p>
<p>Most of the above-mentioned eight people, Mei, Cheng, Xun, Shang, Huang, Wang, Du, and Zhang, are from Yan and Zhao. Only Du Liyun is from Nanjing. It is truly amazing that a southerner can be famous in the northern part of the drama's origin. The excellence of his art can also be imagined. The reasons for Liyun's fame are three. First, he is intelligent. Second, he is studious. Third, he is well-endowed. However, apart from these three factors, the main reason is Wang Yaoqing's good guidance. A good material is different after a polishing. As the saying goes, "A famous teacher produces a great student."</p>
<p>Liyun's name has been made. Each record company invited people to beg her to record. This year, Beikai Company went to Beijing to record and also recorded three good pieces. The plays she sang were selected by her teacher Yaoqing. "Yu Tang Chun Probes Prison," including two yellow, a quick three eyes, and one side. Except for the "Flesh Punishment," which includes a Xipi allegro, a rocking board, and one side of the "Bian Rong Sword" including two yellow upside-down boards, one slow dragon board, and one side. Structure of Jing. The tone is good. Both are above those recorded for the first time. It can be seen that the selection of plays is also an important part of the recording business. Liyun's new film. "Bian Rong Sword" and "Yu Tang Chun Probes Prison Except for Flesh Punishment" will be released first. One film of "Diao Chan" will be released at the end of the year.</p>
<p>"Hibiscus Sword" is a unique drama by Liyun. The script was written by Yaoqing. The allegro of the three eyes recorded by Beikai is very similar to Cheng Yushuang's "Scolding the Palace." No one has ever paid attention to the "Yu Tang Chun Probes Prison" section. This time, Beikai won it. It cannot be said that it is not a small fortune.</p>
<p>News In brief On the other day, Shen Garden hosted a banquet for the press at a Hongkou restaurant. After the meal, Mr. Lin Shisan specially prepared a car and went to the garden. Try to release fireworks and flames on the Guangdong stage. The sound of smashing was endless. Some rose high into the clouds, and some rose in circles. Some were like shooting stars, and some were like pearls. Some rode on locomotives, and some rode on horses. Holding fireworks, they played various dances and Shi Lin's sacrificial pagoda. The changes are bizarre. Colorful. It is a spectacle. All the guests were greatly impressed. There are still many colors of flowers that have not been released. It was already past 11 o'clock. The host and guests enjoyed themselves and dispersed. (First)</p>
<h3>Travels in India (89)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>India is a wondrous country in the world. It is estimated that if someone with travel expenses comes here, spends half a year learning the language, and also understands English, two or three people can travel together, spending two years touring its provinces, exploring Buddhist sites and customs, and making significant contributions to society. Our country's capitalists only know how to count money, and warlords always claim to retire and go abroad. They do not know that escaping to Japan is supporting an empire, going to Europe and America only increases extravagance, and going to Russia is disliked for its red ideology. I think the best thing for warlords after retirement is to travel to India and learn the secrets of longevity from the naked great immortals, or find a new place to live. Gandhi is not thorough enough; he is only half-naked, not truly naked. This great immortal is truly a naked-buttocked monkey. Only the hair on his body has not yet grown. I have truly seen a real immortal.</p>
<p>Having had the opportunity to visit the first high mountain great immortal, I returned to the monk Xinxin's garden and discussed this matter. Xinxin smiled and said, "You cannot do it. If you can take off your clothes and sit by our Ganges River for several months, we can pay our respects to you and proclaim to everyone, 'This is a great immortal from China who has lived in the mountains of Manchuria for many years.' At that time, men and women will bring incense and flowers as offerings, garlands will be placed around your neck, and donations will come. It will be very easy." I laughed and said, "I am too sick to do it." Alas, Europe and China believe in heroes with guns, while Indians believe in naked-buttocked monkeys, calling them immortals and Buddhas. Does this mean that Indians will ultimately be saved by immortals and Buddhas? A student named Kuba told me that this is the number one great immortal, who has been single-mindedly communicating with the gods for over ten years, only consuming milk. Dignitaries and celebrities from various places all respect him. He was specially invited for this grand ceremony. His titles are equivalent to those formerly given to the Buddha and the same as those given to Gandhi today. But Indians do not value the Buddha, not even young students. I said, "Why doesn't India change its name to the Buddha's Country?" He refused, saying, "Our country has many immortals and Buddhas. We cannot call it the Buddha's Country to reduce our value, because the Buddha is just one fruit, while India is the tree." Such is the self-importance of the Indians. This is how even a young student thinks, let alone others?</p>
<p>I passed a temple, and someone told me, "This is the Monkey Temple." I asked the reason, and he replied, "This temple was originally a temple for gods, but many monkeys often stay in it, so Westerners call it the Monkey Temple." I asked if there are many monkeys in India. He said, "Yes." I asked where there are the most. He said, "Near Delhi (where the British Governor-General lives), westward, in the province where I live, there are many monkeys, numbering in the hundreds." I enjoy studying animal sociology, so I asked for details. He replied, "Monkeys also have two kinds of lives: city monkeys and rural monkeys. Rural monkeys do not enter the city, and city monkeys do not go to the countryside. Each lives in peace and enjoys their work. If people pass through monkey territory and do not offend them, they coexist peacefully. But if one is offended, they will surround and attack, and their collective power is great. Sometimes they come to play pranks, teasing people and snatching away their shoes and hats, demanding sweets. If you give them food, they will return the items to their original place." I asked if monkeys eat meat. He said, "No. Monkeys are herbivores." I asked if monkey groups get along well. He said, "They get along very well. But a former natural history professor told me about male monkeys killing female monkeys, which is probably accidental. Monkey nature is also unequal. In general, monkeys are more docile than other animals."</p>
<h3>Lakeside Pavilion Poetry Talk (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>For the fourth poem, the lines "Beyond the Rainbow Bridge, the waters stretch far, / The mountain colors are hazy, the moon like the tide," should be chosen. The Rainbow Bridge is the sixth bridge on the Su Causeway from south to north. Inside the bridge, the lake surface is already narrow, and the lake is surrounded by mountains. Only beyond the bridge does the water meet the sky, stretching endlessly. Therefore, the words "stretch far" are quite fitting, echoing the word "tide" in the following line, making the description even more exquisite. The words "mountain colors are hazy" are also quite integrated, mutually relevant, and not empty. The third and fourth lines should be "Sitting alone, who can share the tune? / A flute sound from beneath the red curtain by the water," or "A flute sound from beneath the red curtain by the sea." But this borrows from Ding'an's "Rising, the moon beneath the red curtain by the sea, / Fragrance of flowers surrounds, furious like the tide," which has nothing to do with the word "flute." Moreover, "sea red" is synonymous with crabapple. Li Deyu's "Flower and Tree Records" states, "All flowers and trees named 'sea' come from overseas, such as crabapples." Ding'an's original line corresponds to the word "flower" and is not merely about color. Taking only the phrase "beneath the red curtain by the sea" still feels lacking. The words "red curtain" originally come from Zeng Gong's "Southern Lake Journey": "Red curtains on painted boats, many viewers gaze, / Beauties sit within, raising their jade eyebrows." Since boat curtains are smaller than usual, the example of "Small Red Mansion" can be used, adding the word "small," which also happens to be a person's name, fitting with the word "flute." As for "Sitting alone, who can share the tune?" it is taken from Tang poetry, reversing the word "alone" to depict two people sitting together on a boat: one sitting cross-legged at the bow, seemingly listening intently while playing the qin, and the other serving by the window, holding their hair up and playing the flute. The scene is picturesque and worthy of contemplation, incomparable to the lonely state of "Who is my companion?" Other versions include "Sitting alone, who can understand my mood? / A sound of 'him' from beneath the crystal curtain," "Sitting alone, bored, who accompanies me? / Suddenly hearing a sound of 'qing' from beneath the curtain," "Sitting alone at the study window, who shares my words? / A rooster's crow from beneath the luminous curtain," using "study window" to foreshadow "rooster," as mentioned in "Miscellaneous Records of Cai Lan," "The Luminous Curtain of the Chicken Forest, shining in broad daylight," highlighting the rooster's crow, which is quite ingenious. It is a pity that the preceding two lines are difficult to match. Another version is "Sitting alone on the meditation mat, who awakens me? / A sound of the bell from behind the lowered curtain." According to "Miscellaneous Records of Duyang," the cold-proof curtain is made of bird bones, which is not something found on a meditation mat, so it seems unsuitable. Another version is "Sitting alone in the quiet pavilion, who understands my words? / A parrot's chatter from behind the curtain selling tea," which is also acceptable but somewhat strained.</p>
<p>The above-listed lines have countless minor variations. Due to space limitations, they will not all be listed. All contributors will receive a small gift. However, many submitted envelopes were detached and unclear, making it difficult to locate the contributors. The following measures are proposed:</p>
<p>1.  Gifts can be selected from any product of the "Invincible Brand" from the Family Industrial Cooperative. However, half of the listed price must be sent, and the gift will be sent accordingly. The limit will be based on the number of selected and double-circled words in the original work, with each word valued at one yuan. For example, if ten words are selected, one can choose items worth ten yuan, but only send half the price, five yuan. We will adhere to this standard.</p>
<p>2.  All aforementioned gifts will be sent by the Invincible Brand General Factory on Meixue Road in Shanghai to avoid loss or errors. Please indicate the first line of each original work for verification. The deadline is the Double Tenth Festival (October 10th); after that date, it will be invalid, as the Industrial Cooperative requires us to settle the price, and we must have a closing date.</p>
<p>3.  Many items are easy to mail and will be disclosed daily in the advertisement section.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Rose Last Week</h3>
<p>Complex Situation, Review of Twenty Taels: Last week, spot gold prices trended upward, but the situation was complex and chaotic, like unpredictable winds and rains. Daily fluctuations of five, six, or even ten taels were common, becoming the norm, and there was no way to intervene. This was due to conflicting overseas news. Although silver markets in the UK and the US both reported increases, there was no significant buying. Shanghai exchange rates were also loose, with sterling rising by half a tick. Some gold businesses were buying to hedge against short positions. However, the gold market went in the opposite direction, which was mainly due to the efforts of a certain bank to buy aggressively and absorb physical gold, sparing no effort to ship it overseas, amounting to over ten thousand bars, which stirred up the market. From the beginning of the week, when the market opened at only 75 taels, it broke through the 790-tael mark, reaching 95.5 taels, the highest peak in recent times. Afterward, the market consolidated, but broke through 80 taels by the weekend, falling sharply to 76 taels. This week saw a fluctuation of 20 taels and 0.05 mace. Overall, it still rose by one tael. As for the daily exchange settlement price, it decreased by over 30 taels. However, the price of physical bars managed to hold steady, increasing by eight or nine taels compared to the spot gold price, as the Tianjin gang no longer purchased them and there were resales. Speculation also occurred. This was due to the efforts of a certain bank to collect gold, resulting in a current inventory of only a little over ten thousand bars. It is feared that the future of the gold market will continue to fluctuate. The general situation of this week is summarized below:</p>
<p>Banks Absorbing Physical Gold, Repeatedly Reaching Peaks: On Monday, August 17th, the price of taels and silver remained unchanged, and there were no changes in the exchange rate. However, internal conditions were slightly tight, with interbank borrowing exceeding lending. The October spot gold market opened lower at 775 taels due to the failure of the large tael market to decline on Saturday. Subsequently, Wu, a major player, covered his short position, and the Central Bank aggressively bought, causing the price to skyrocket quickly, reaching 92 taels by noon and closing at 90 taels. In the afternoon, there seemed to be a decline as the exchange rate eased slightly, reaching only 87 taels and 0.01 mace, closing at 87 taels and 0.08 mace, still up 9 taels and 0.03 mace from the previous weekend. The difference between the morning and afternoon markets was 17 taels. The total volume of transactions for each firm exceeded supply. The next day, the large tael market remained unchanged, and sterling decreased by half a tick. However, the internal market eased slightly. The gold market opened flat at 88 taels, followed by 87.5 taels. Due to the decline in US silver and news of several bank closures in the US, the market became agitated, rising to 95.5 taels. Afterward, buyers took advantage of the momentum, falling sharply by over eight taels, closing at 86 taels and 0.06 mace at noon. In the afternoon, there was a sudden drop to 83.5 taels, closing at 84.5 taels, down 3 taels and 0.03 mace from the previous day. The total fluctuation for the day was 12 taels. On Wednesday, the large tael market increased by 0.0625, the price of silver increased by 0.125, and sterling rose by half a tick. The internal market also eased slightly, with some selling occurring among banks. The spot gold market opened lower at 82 taels. It was then reported that Germany was buying silver to mint silver coins, causing the market to decline to only 79.5 taels, then rising to 86 taels. HSBC bought sterling at 0.0625 to 0.06875, but sellers continued to sell, falling to 80 taels and 0.06 mace, closing at 83.5 taels at noon. Zheng Jin of the Dalian gang sold, and Dalian bills were reported to be small. There were also disturbances by the Japanese in Qingdao, so the closing price was 81 taels and 0.01 mace, down 3 taels and 0.04 mace from the previous day, with a total fluctuation of 6.5 taels for the day. On the following day, the large tael and sterling rates remained unchanged, but the internal bank market strengthened, and banking businesses continued to buy and close their positions. The spot gold market opened high at 85.5 taels, due to news that Mexico was selling silver and the US exchange rate was also small. Subsequently, it rose to 90 taels, but Wu and others sold, falling to only 85 taels. With the sterling rate appearing favorable, it rose again by 4 taels, reaching 90 taels and 0.06 mace in the afternoon after a certain bank stepped in to buy, closing at 89 taels and 0.06 mace, an increase of 8.5 taels, with a fluctuation of only 5.6 taels throughout the day. On Friday, the large tael market remained unchanged, and the sterling rate remained the same. The gold market opened slightly lower at 88.5 taels, with supply exceeding demand. It then fell gradually by 7 taels, reaching only 81 taels and 0.07 mace, closing at 84 taels at noon. In the afternoon, it broke below 80 taels, reaching 78 taels and 0.08 mace, due to a shortage in the internal sterling market, closing at 78 taels and 0.09 mace, a sharp decrease of 10 taels and 0.07 mace from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 10 taels. Yuan Kangxiang, on behalf of Fuxing Yongwang, sold over 3,000 bars. On Saturday, the large tael market increased by 0.125, the price of US silver also rose by 0.125, and sterling rose by half a tick. Internal conditions were flat, with some selling occurring among banking businesses. The gold market opened slightly higher by 1 tael and 0.06 mace, at 80 taels and 0.05 mace, followed by 83 taels, but due to excessive selling, it closed at 76 taels. Suddenly, there was news that a certain bank was shipping cash, which boosted market confidence, adding to 81.5 taels, but market sentiment was flat, closing at 79.5 taels, an increase of only 0.06 mace from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 7 taels. However, the underlying trend was soft, with Hongli and others selling off long positions, while a certain bank bought slightly. The high and low prices of the silver markets in the UK, US, and India, as well as exchange rates and spot gold prices, are listed below:</p>

<h3>Money Tightens Step by Step</h3>
<p>Yesterday, being Sunday, banks were closed, so the financial atmosphere was very quiet. The market price of foreign currency in the market was mostly sluggish, with the morning and afternoon markets both at 7 mace, 2 fen, 5 li, 0.1 hao, and 0.0125 hu.

<p>Securities: Bond Prices Continued to Rise Last Week</p>
<p>Minimal Fluctuations Throughout the Week… Transactions Exceeded 80 Million</p>
<p>Last week's bond market situation in this city: the futures market was as flat as before, and the sentiment among buyers and sellers was quite sluggish. Except for the Consolidated Tax Bonds, which were slightly more active than before, and the 20 Customs Bonds, which were similar to before, the others were all less active than before. Looking at the daily trading volume throughout the week, Tuesday reached over 19.5 million yuan, the first day of the week was only 14.5 million yuan, and the rest were quiet, averaging only around 11 million yuan. The total transaction volume was 80.08 million yuan, an increase of over 3.3 million yuan compared to the previous week. Among them, Consolidated Tax Bonds accounted for 30.16 million yuan, with 15.37 million yuan in the August contract and 14.79 million yuan in the September contract. 20 Customs Bonds accounted for 18.635 million yuan, with 11.425 million yuan in the August contract and 7.21 million yuan in the September contract. Others, such as 20 Rolled Customs Bonds, accounted for 4.995 million yuan in the August contract and 2.38 million yuan in the September contract. 19 Customs Bonds accounted for 4.3 million yuan in the August contract and 2.185 million yuan in the September contract. 19 Benevolent Bonds accounted for 3.72 million yuan in the August contract and 2.41 million yuan in the September contract. Disarmament Bonds accounted for 2.785 million yuan in the August contract and 1.66 million yuan in the September contract. Reorganization Bonds accounted for 2.4 million yuan in the August contract and 875,000 yuan in the September contract. The 6% Consolidation Bonds accounted for 1.335 million yuan, the 96 Public Bonds accounted for 1.145 million yuan, and the Customs Tax Bonds accounted for 925,000 yuan. 7-Year Bonds accounted for 25,000 yuan, and Long-Term Financial Bonds accounted for 145,000 yuan. The spot market was extremely desolate, with a total transaction volume of only 30,400 yuan throughout the week, of which Disarmament Bonds accounted for 14,000 yuan, and the others were only several thousand yuan. As for the trend of bond prices during the past week, the political situation was calm, and the bond market environment remained unchanged. Moreover, it was already late in the month, and the settlement period was approaching, so buyers and sellers were cautious, and market transactions were sporadic. The balance between supply and demand was balanced, and the market price fluctuations were peaceful. The prices of various bonds fluctuated with the temporary supply and demand situation in the market, with few other important reasons to influence the market. Therefore, although the prices fluctuated intermittently, the trend was extremely chaotic, but it was still not deserted due to the needs of small retail investors, so it was still able to maintain its stable state. As a result, all continued to rise slightly compared to the previous week, but the amount was only around 4 or 5 jiao. Only the 20 Rolled Customs Bonds in the 96 Futures contract were slightly lower. The spot prices of 19 Customs Bonds (large denomination) and Disarmament Bonds rose by nearly 2 yuan. It is difficult to see a rise or fall in the bond market for the time being. The following is a statistical table of the high, low, and fluctuating prices of various bonds during the past week (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>| Bond Type | Contract/Spot | Highest | Day | Lowest | Day | Difference | Increase/Decrease |</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Remained Stable Last Week</p>
<p>The yarn market remained dull last week, without any signs of improvement. The global cotton industry situation was extremely pessimistic, causing market anxiety and a general sell-off by speculators. However, some manufacturers with long positions believed that there was genuine market demand, and trading in coarse yarn by the Yunnan and Sichuan gangs was still active. As this month's prices were cheaper than the spot prices on the market, they bought heavily this month, intending to take delivery. This also boosted the prices of distant months. However, a major merchant, considering the poor overall trend and the easing of raw material prices, still had no intention of covering short positions, only intending to close out this month's positions, selling near-month contracts and buying distant-month contracts. In summary, the global situation is deteriorating, and the future is not optimistic. However, spot sales have improved somewhat, so the yarn market has been able to maintain a soft but firm state. The prices of various spot yarn contracts were higher than last week, with the current month up 1 tael and 7 or 8 mace, and distant months up slightly by 3 or 4 mace. The total transaction volume was 15,260 bales, with 2,120 bales traded among members of the trade. The market was generally flat. Osaka Sanpin yarn fell by 3 or 4 yuan compared to the previous week. The number of bales purchased by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>| Gang     | Bales | Gang     | Bales | Gang     | Bales |</p>
<p>|----------|-------|----------|-------|----------|-------|</p>
<p>| Sichuan  | 1,975 | Yunnan  | 800 | Guangdong | 1,375 |</p>
<p>| Tianjin  | 1,305 | Jiangxi  | 200 | Inland | 1,195 |</p>
<p>| Shantou  | 275 | Hong Kong | 110 | Qingdao | 805 |</p>
<p>| North Gang | 300 | Zhenjiang | 230 | Hankou | 125 |</p>
<p>| Miscellaneous Gangs | 565 | Members of the Trade | 2,120 |</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Desolate</h3>
<p>Spot Sales Almost Entirely Taken Over by Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market was still calm at the beginning of the week, as most members of the trade were watching, tending to take long positions due to the severe flooding in Hankou and the widespread submergence of cotton fields. However, as both American and Indian cotton prices turned downward again, and the exchange rate was weak, foreign firms and foreign firms on the market competed fiercely to sell, and prices were particularly flexible. However, various manufacturers, shuddering at the oversupply abroad, did not attempt to buy. The market then turned sharply downward, and several factories bought cheap foreign cotton and short-sold spot cotton, totaling about 100,000 piculs. This situation is rare in recent years. However, the price of local cotton in this city is already low. At 33 taels for this cotton, it is worth holding. Regardless of the overall global situation, the market is tightening step by step. However, the import price of American cotton by the Hengfeng Factory was only 33 taels and 0.075 mace. This cotton can probably be spun into fine yarn. Therefore, judging from the overall trend, the outlook for spot cotton is still not optimistic. Also, the buying agent of a foreign firm that went bankrupt the other day sold 9,000 bales of Bailuoqiuqu'wengmo Lapinggouer cotton at a bargain price of 31 taels and 0.075 mace, all to the Yong'an Yarn Factory. This week saw a complete absence of local cotton transactions. However, as foreign cotton was cheap and of good quality, transactions occurred frequently. Spot cotton prices fell by 3 or 4 mace compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume was 540,500 piculs, with 1,000 bales of Yaohua cotton sourced. American cotton fell by 20 or 30 pounds compared to the previous week. The prices and bale numbers of foreign cotton purchased by each factory are listed below:</p>
<p>| Factory Import  | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Transaction Volume |</p>
<p>|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------------|</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Adjusting the Supply and Demand of American Cotton</h3>
<p>Global Economic Recession… Demand for American Cotton Gradually Decreases</p>
<p>First Estimate Shows a Sharp Increase… Projected Inventory Expected to Grow Larger</p>
<p>The Daily News previously commented on the abundant harvest of American cotton. We now translate as follows: The U.S. Department of Agriculture released its first estimate of new cotton production at 15,584,000 bales, an increase of 1,652,000 bales compared to the actual harvest of the previous year. As a result, the world cotton market plummeted on the 10th, with New York spot prices falling to within seven cents. Previously, the U.S. government, to regulate cotton production and prevent value decline, had advised farmers to reduce cotton acreage by 20%. However, the actual new cotton planting area was 41,491,000 acres, only slightly less than 10%. Moreover, due to favorable weather after sowing, the cotton crop is very good, and only 3% of cotton fields have been abandoned. Therefore, the estimated actual harvested cotton area is 40,129,000 acres, with an average yield of 185.8 pounds per acre, which is a rich harvest compared to the average of 151.4 pounds per acre in the past decade. It is even more than 3 pounds higher than the 282.6 pounds in 1926, demonstrating the extent of this year's bumper crop.</p>
<p>Now, the U.S. government's policy of limiting cotton production has failed due to the estimated unusually abundant harvest. The supply and demand in the new cotton year (from August of this year to the end of July next year) will inevitably remain in surplus. The world demand for American cotton is also trending downward with the deepening economic recession. The amount used in the last cotton year, ending at the end of July this year, was still 11,200,000 bales, a decrease year by year compared to the 13,000,000 bales in the year before last and the more than 15,000,000 bales in the year before that. Therefore, the world inventory of American cotton at the end of July this year reached as much as 9,000,000 bales. Adding this year's new cotton of more than 15,500,000 bales, but considering that the global economy remains in recession and cotton consumption is unlikely to increase, if consumption is the same as last year, then by the end of July next year, there will be an inventory of more than 13,000,000 bales, approximately equal to the oversupply of one year's production. Unless the weather deteriorates in the future, reducing the harvest, or the global cotton industry recovers, increasing demand, there is likely no hope for adjusting supply and demand.</p>
<h3>American, British, and Indian Cotton Consistently Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose due to good news from Liverpool and favorable weather. The market was mixed. Futures rose 13 to 18 points, and spot prices rose 2 points. British cotton futures rose 5 points, and spot prices rose 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 15 points. Indian cotton was firm due to good news from Liverpool, short covering, and broker purchases. Pingguor rose 2.75 rupees, Aomula rose 2.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose 1.75 rupees.

<p>Rice Market Downturn in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, about 30 rice boats arrived at the South City district. Sales in this district were sluggish. Su-Tong white japonica rice dropped by 3 jiao, and ordinary japonica rice plunged by 4 or 5 jiao. Thin indica rice was slightly quiet due to limited supply, while high-quality rice remained stable, and lower-quality rice decreased by 2 jiao. Lu Yang pointed rice varieties each dropped by 1 chi. Buying interest was unusually quiet. Early rice sales were slightly active in small quantities, but sales were not smooth, indicating a downstream trend. Glutinous rice arrivals were continuous, but sales were surprisingly stagnant, with prices falling by 1 jiao. The weather was cloudy, and the market was unremarkable.</p>
<p>Limited arrivals in Xin Zha, with exceptionally quiet sales. Changshu-Wuxi northern japonica rice fell sharply by as much as 5 jiao. Kunshan thick japonica rice saw an intensified downward trend, needing only a decrease of 3 jiao. Arrivals of thin indica rice from Nanxiang, Qingjiao, and Shipu were somewhat scarce. Although the desire to buy was still sluggish, prices for high-quality rice were stable, while lower-quality rice was sluggish. Sales of Lu Yang pointed rice and wharf pointed rice from the surrounding countryside were slightly active, and prices continued to decline.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Trends Lower</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market updates from production areas were unavailable due to it being a Sunday. The public association market was quiet with little trading. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white high-quality sugar was 11 taels and 6 qian, while old stock was between 11 taels and 5 qian to 4 qian and 5 fen, with varying prices and a generally weak trend. No. 20 medium white sugar was 11 taels and 1 qian, with few interested buyers. High-quality sugar was 11 taels and 3 qian, with some transactions. The market was calm and unremarkable. Raw brown sugar was 10 taels and 3 qian, and bowl green was 8 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen, showing a relatively firm trend. After the launch of Taikoo granulated sugar from the factory, market sentiment turned calm, and prices trended downward. B-mark was 12 taels and 1 qian, and old stock was 11 taels and 5 fen, with few inquiries. DY-mark was 11 taels and 9 qian, also with few inquiries. HM-mark was 10 taels and 4 qian and 5 fen, and H-mark was 10 taels and 8 qian and 5 fen, with slightly more active demand. The market remained calm and unremarkable.</p>

<h3>Life of Working Women in New York (11)</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The daily life of a woman earning $50 to $75 a week, Catherine O'Hare, is as follows:</p>
<p>Catherine O'Hare filters the coffee through a filter. Her roommate, Helen Lister, is still asleep. It's Catherine's turn to make breakfast today. They both eat in the living room of their shared apartment. The rest of the apartment consists of a bedroom with two cots, a bathroom, and a cupboard built into the wall that serves as a small kitchen. This shared apartment is located in the village, near Bank Street. A place like this costs the two women $80 a month in rent.</p>
<p>Catherine, wearing casual clothes, leaves the remaining breakfast on the table, which includes fresh orange juice, oatmeal, toast, and various other foods. Then she goes to wake Helen. Helen, still sleepy, walks into the living room.</p>
<p>"Oh, Catherine, the coffee smells wonderful. I feel like I haven't been asleep for more than a minute. It's really strange."</p>
<p>"Did we want you to stay awake, just because those kids wanted to sing?"</p>
<p>"I really don't care about those things. I have an appointment at nine o'clock and need to hurry. If I can sell that insurance policy to that woman, Catherine will have a good week."</p>
<p>Catherine is an insurance broker. Her weekly income averages around $65. She sells life insurance to successful working women. She has a special experience. She has found that these women, whether married or single, have financial support.</p>
<p>Catherine's family lives in Albany. She studied at Cornell University for two years. In her sophomore year, her father passed away, and Catherine had to fend for herself. Her mother went to Chicago to live with her married sister. Against her mother's protests, Catherine went to New York. Initially, she worked as a secretary in a store, always keeping an eye out for other positions. Later, she became a receptionist in an insurance company. She became very interested in the insurance business and suggested to the staff in the company that she would like to try selling insurance policies. They taught her the specialized knowledge of this business. One morning, she took a list of names and started this work.</p>
<p>In the first year, Catherine could barely make ends meet. Now, her income is quite considerable and can continue to improve. One thing she finds difficult is that her daily work can be as long or as short as she wants. So, she is easily tempted to do things like getting up late in the morning, eating a leisurely breakfast at home, or stopping work at four o'clock and reading books arbitrarily before eating. She is very strict with herself and works for eight hours every day. Because of this, she has increased her success compared to many female lawyers who do not work full days.</p>
<p>Catherine and her college friend Helen share this apartment. They gradually add to the furnishings in the room, choosing many practical old appliances at reasonable prices. All the wall decorations and pictures are mostly brought from home. The curtains are made of cheerful printed cotton fabric. The two women enjoy complete freedom in their apartment. They take turns cleaning the room, and a woman comes every week to clean everything for them. The women take their shirts and other items out to be washed, and they wash small items themselves in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Catherine is very particular about her clothing because she wants to emulate successful young working women. Her clothes are well-designed and well-made, and she often buys new clothes. So, she puts a lot of thought into her clothing. Dry cleaning and maintaining her clothes are also necessary, which costs a lot. Catherine pays attention to every small detail of her attire. Her Oxford shoes are made of high-quality leather, and her hand-stitched deerskin gloves are also one of her luxury investments. This morning, she added a leather flat flower to the lapel of her wool coat for decoration.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Helen, wish me success," she said as she left.</p>
<p>The woman she is visiting is an administrator at a public service organization. She brings various insurance policies, but she hopes to sell life insurance policies. Catherine has solved this problem in several ways and prepared a lot of relevant materials. She is very enthusiastic about the people she is going to visit. Her work often brings her into contact with people, and she has made many friends through her business.</p>
<p>Her neat and beautiful appearance makes it easy for people to see her. So, as soon as she arrives at her destination, she walks into the room of the person she is visiting. She explains each insurance policy simply and thoroughly. After an hour of conversation, questions, and explanations, she sells the insurance policy. Her face does not show pride, but she is very grateful to this woman in her heart.</p>
<p>"Do you feel tired of this sales job?" the woman asks.</p>
<p>"No," Catherine replies, "If I feel tired, I will do something else. I know I have some things that people need, so I let them sell themselves. I never force anyone. These are all true words."</p>
<p>After Catherine has completed the insurance policy procedures, she really wants to take a day off to celebrate. Later, she realizes that this is foolish. She still has several people to visit that day, so she needs to work enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Catherine feels very satisfied with her activities this morning. She knows that success is the foundation for more success. The people she visits are impressed by her lively and cheerful spirit. By noon, she is extremely hungry. She often eats wherever she happens to be. But this afternoon, she is in the financial district of downtown. She runs into a small tea room, which is often frequented by high-level secretaries and businessmen from other industries. Catherine, regardless of the price, orders the waiter to bring her what she wants to eat. Normally, she would always consider the prices on the menu.</p>
<p>Because Catherine's income does not have a set amount, it is difficult to save some money, but she often wants to make a budget, but feels it is time-consuming and energy-draining, so she always does things the same way. Helen manages the household accounts, and they both split each expense equally.</p>
<p>After lunch, Catherine goes to visit another buyer, and then returns to the office to do two hours of necessary work. She talks with other salespeople and reports the day's progress to the manager. At half-past four, she sets off for home. She feels physically tired, but mentally excited. Her work is often outdoors, providing her with an opportunity to exercise her body. She drinks a cup of tea at home, rests in casual clothes, and has a job with a rich income, a comfortable home, and physical benefits. It is truly not shallow.</p>
<p>The phone rings. It's Helen calling. She wants Catherine to buy some food because she is bringing a friend home for dinner. The women are very welcoming to guests, so Catherine puts on her clothes and goes to the grocery store to buy things. They can't buy too much food because the apartment only has one oven for cooking. The price must also be considered, so they only pick out a few tasty but inexpensive foods to buy. Catherine remembers how much she hated cooking when she was at home, but now she finds it interesting and enjoyable to cook her own things in the shared apartment. (To be continued)</p>
