<p>時評</p>
<h3>金貴銀賤問題與英美</h3>
<p>金貴銀賤之趨勢。至今日而猶日進不巳也。言救濟之辦法雖多。然至今日。仍未見一有效之辦法也。然則此金貴銀賤之潮流。纷纷擾擾。果將至何時而始定乎。曰必俟有一日能將金銀價兌換比例之標準。確實折衷定出。而後金貴銀賤之潮流始定。蓋此關係世界非人力所能操縱補救之潮流。必須有一世</p>
<p>界人可以共同遵守之法律。而後挽此潮流以納之於一定範圍之中。如此則非確定一金銀價比例之標準不可也。苟不如是則無所謂金貴亦無所謂銀賤。貴尙有貴貴將至於何境賤尙有賤。賤將至於何度。均非今人所能測知也。雖然。此種比例定價之辦法未嘗無人言之也。言之而不能行何也則以富有金銀之國各有主張富於產金之國。與富於產銀之國主張不同。倫敦市塲之。目光。又與紐約市塲之目光不同不同不能合作以定此標準。今日倫敦電謂英不院討論美政府請參加會議恢復銀價事財政大臣史诺登之意。以爲英政府不必發起此事。惟由關係較大國發起召集國際會議。則英不退居人</p>
<p>後。其言對於美國請書之贊同與否。尙未明瞭。惟其對於召集國際會議。則極願贊成之。已見言外竊謂國際會議而果成者。必當以討論此金銀價比例之</p>
<p>標準爲主要。各國而果誠心合作以謀救濟此金貴銀賤之潮流者。必以各國同心協力速成此國際會議爲主要。</p>

<h3>黎人風俗談</h3>
<p>孫籌成</p>
<p>昨晤舊友楊德壎。述及渠此次在廣東。偕參謀長黄莫公及艾質彬。田金海宋樑等諸同志。赴瓊南島之黎峒。視察黎人生活與地勢。以期開化其知識。並擬建築公路。所見情形。與内地完全不同。爰摘記如下。以供採風問俗者之研究十月七日由海口所之府城駐營地出發。向文昌。嘉積。陵水等縣。歷二十餘日。行抵五指山（五峯並列其形如手指故曰五指山）該處即爲黎人聚居之地。道路崎嶇。不易行走。行軍每日祇有二十餘里可走。沿途椰樹林立。此乃該地最富之出產品。黎人男子下身。以布一方。遮蔽其生殖器。上身全裸。女子亦以布一方蔽其私處兩乳高聳。雜於人中。恬不爲怪。頸項内满裝鐵質項圈。大如面盆。笨重不堪。耳環均以鉛質製造。形長如鐵練。赤足露臂。行動時環項相觸有聲。以爲得意。房屋構造甚簡單。均以竹爲架而覆以茅蓬。如江浙兩省窮民所住之草棚然。室内佈置。大都以毛竹編爲床舖。上面睡人。下面睡猪。奇臭觸鼻。令人欲嘔。每日晨起。咸以稻打米爲工作。别無所事。米作紅色。粗劣異常。不種蔬菜。貧苦者咸以樹葉佐餐殊難下嚥。牲畜除猪牛羊鷄鵝鴨六種外。别無所有。婚嫁禮節。據云與野蠻時代相同。並無訂婚結親等手續。女子被任何男子强佔。即爲其妻。故因爭奪女子。常有决鬥之事發生。該地人民與外界素不往來。故此次結伴前往。黎人莫不駭異。視我儕如天仙。我儕携去之電筒。鍼線。話匣。爆竹等物。黎人從未見過。不明其發光有聲之原委。均視爲有神秘作用。環立呆視。終日不去。甚至遠道來觀者絡繹於途。該地買賣行爲。均以貨易貨。與上古相仿。金錢向不流通。我輩食其鷄鴨。給以金錢。皆掉頭不顧。與以鍼線等物。無不樂受。最奇者。臨行時將鏡子數面送與。渠等對鏡顧影。初甚驚惶。呆若木雞。旋見本人動作。鏡内畢現。莫不視爲拱璧稱謝而去。</p>

<p>蜘蛛雖爲渺末之蟲。然吐緖結網。自具機杼。晉君稱其智。太昊以爲師。有非尋常蚑跂脈脈者所得而比擬也。據動物學家之考察。謂其肛門端有紡織腺。内貯形如蛋白之液汁。上有細孔六七百個。脈體收縮。則液自細孔流出。觸空氣凝爲極細之絲。因絲爲網。以網爲巢。　蝶掛蛾。藉此果腹。茲聞人述蜘蛛救人七命事。洵屬千古奇談。但言之確鏧。絕非荒誕。不妨記之以博閱者諸君一粲。日前贛省共禍。有汪碩卿者。爲邑中名紳。家道頗豐。具園林台榭之勝。碩卿性耽風雅。啸傲其中大有香山居士所謂游山弄水携詩卷。看月尋花把酒杯之槪｀廣蓄當代書畫。上及四王吳惲。嚢錦裝池。備極寳愛。不料事有出人意料者。共禍猝發。焚掠殘殺。無所不至。汪爲紳士。自在剷除之列。然得訊之餘。惶急失措。無可遁避。不得已。汪及其妻妾三幼子一婢女。同入假山洞中。借堀礨崴魁。以爲逋逃之藪。翌晨。共軍果來搜索。司閽及僕輩俱被戕害。房　複室。徧尋汪之踪跡。奈皆聞其無人。旣而尋至假山洞口。則蛛網密佈。不管丸泥之封函谷。共軍欲入。忽率隊者曰。洞佈蛛網。其絕人跡可知。旣無虎子。無須入穴。共軍從之。遂呼啸而去。汪之一家七命。得以保全。或謂汪家世代不殺生物。檐端屋角之蜘蛛。從不加以殲滅。此所以獲蜘蛛之厚報也。舊時因果之說。似不合於今世新潮。人姑妄言之。我姑妄聽之而已。</p>
<h3>嗜賭喪妻</h3>
<p>龍</p>
<p>每屆臘尾年頭。不論城廂市錢。窮鄕僻壞。牌九搖賓。觸目皆是。有司不禁。一種歡欣鼓舞。普天同慶之狀。洵可樂也。孰知緣是而有絕大慘劇發生者乎。南邑新廟。每逢更歲之際。常有一二宵小。聚衆賭博。從中漁利。某次有附近農民沈桂生者。亦視賭若命之流。以屢戰屢北之故。陸續將妻房首飾。私自取去。充作賭本。乃愈輸愈甚。取無可取。　新婚妻王氏髮上金釵一事而逸。王氏恚甚。追至距裏里許小石橋上。忽見桂生縱身下水駭極奔往。但見泡影如花。形迹全無。竊思良人被逼溺死。翁姑祇此一子。哀號多時。亦奮然躍下。了却種種煩惱。而與良人爲伴。</p>
<p>距桂生。素諳水性。有河底鳬游至數里外上岸。向戚家借衣換妥。逍遙半日。直至傍晚歸家。始知愛妻已以身殉。桂生夫婦。愛情素篤。不禁抱屍大哭。痛不欲生。自是嫉睹如仇。永不染指。以謝死者。</p>
<p>龍曰。此事雖已明日黄花。然以賭博之害如是之烈。及天下之嗜賭者不止桂生一人。又以廢歷新年已屆。故特表而出之願普天下賭徒及有司知所警惕也。</p>

<p>（續昨）（心晨）</p>
<p>（二）金市支配下之棉市</p>
<p>棉花市况固應與紗市成比例的進迟、但本年以國内存　旣少、新棉生產又歉、更以金價暴漲、雖外棉迭見新低價、而其波勢得較紗市爲和緩也、在過去一年間以外棉壓迫始終呈萎靡不振之局勢、至一月以金價暴漲、滙票步縮所推動、而見三十六兩五錢五分、二月初以美棉驟跌一百餘磅音、致穩定乍見之棉市、又復奔潰、惟以來貨稀少、執貨者態度堅强而盤旋於三十四五兩間、下旬美棉雖重見跌風、未與之升沉也、</p>
<p>但印棉廉價求售、各廠訂購　十三四萬擔、殊爲棉市本身地位之隱憂、三月間美棉又見一九二六年來之低價世界棉市英不隨之下趨廠胃又屬清淡、市勢虚疲但漢帮態度鎭定、而市勢轉平、四月初仍趨向疲途、繼以美棉爲合作社强拉五七月期貨而回漲、本埠存底枯薄、買氮又振徘徊於三十六兩左右、但現銷殊爲表静、至五月初無需要之變化呈參差不定之局勢、蓋一般人所注意之美棉、升降不定、新陳互異、一時似失領導之力、至需要上以印棉吸收已多、亦少發展、但以存少面盤　、迨月末滙市逆流、開空前之紀錄而需要者又活動、遂激成强烈之漲風、六月初金價飛　、漲風仍熾、見三十七兩四錢、蓋此時之棉市本能已失、一唯滙　之馬首是嶦嗣美棉滖存有六百萬包之預料市氣大衰、印棉銷清存厚、發生大破裂、一日間猛跌三十二羅比人心大　、與月初　道而馳、幸以存數不豐、尙不致十分萎靡耳、七月市况又處於疲弱之境美棉因新棉進行順利、銷費大减、市勢萎頓、印棉亦屬泚軟、廠商以存底尙豐、定貨陸續　到　態度肖極但期棉以投機者之操縱未隨外棉作相黨的進退、而發生軋空之風浪八月初因沙市之　　、而美國電傳亢旱形勢平定、　第一次美棉估計發表爲一千四百三十六萬包、　跌二百餘磅音而見一角一分、現貨乏人問津、買戶忍痛斬結、標棉激落二兩餘月末以　貨準備充足、跌至三十一兩九錢九月以美棉續跌、印棉新售、市勢疲軟、但以秋　連　、新棉損失頗巨、市况復轉堅穩、嗣以紗市活　廠胃有一度的需要、市勢續堅、但美棉如江河之日下、印棉復眨價充售、　易殊旺市勢又受壓迫、惟紗市堅穩　呈平定之局面、十　初市况依然虚弱、美棉政府估計發表跌破一角大關、廠商旺　印棉當此新花上市之時、而賓需之清淡、視諸　花時代爲尤甚、益以紗市之軟弱、致棉市地位日益危險、强烈的跌風乃倐然而起各　標棉跌破一兩關下旬美棉有霜害報告合作社又復吸收現貨、漲風驟起、而新棉上市又少、市勢乃復轉漲風、十一月趨勢較爲平和、此乃爲國内新棉軟收所主動、蓋江浙收成固歉、比較稍佳之鄂豫等處、則匪患日深、運輸不便、致上市稀少、更以金銀價之差率益巨、故美印棉一蹶不振與實銷之清淡、未受若何嚴重影響、　十二月初市勢大疲、美棉現貨旣跌破一角大關、絲市復如一瀉千里、廠胃旣停滯、出口亦沉寂、市氣大虚、嗣以美棉與紗市昀告反動、金又愉搖直上、　存旣少到貨又缺、發生軋空之猛烈風潮、本月見三十五兩而辭歲、茲將期現市價與成交、列表如下、</p>

<p>（三）國外花紗之奔落</p>
<p>英棉在年初本上年之趨勢、爲本年之最谪峰、嗣以銷費激减而益衰三月間跌至一角四分而民</p>
<p>世界美棉銷費依然不振、較之上半季　屬　觀、但因合作社吸收五月至七月期貨、市况爲之拉起五　見一角六分七厘、但實　地位仍屬空虚、蓋名國棉業不振之報　　傳、季末滾存數將激增、而新棉進行順利之消息時聞、證　與　　市况一致低跌、故合作社之操　大受打擊市况逐月下趨迨歲　現貨且跌破一角大關、見九分四厘五、爲一九一六年歐戰時九分二厘後之新低價利物浦美棉亦隨紐約市面升沉、印棉跌風更甚於美棉、近來印度革命風潮迭興、政局不寗、棉廠中工日多、而新棉生產又屬良好勃洛去在一月間爲三百○九羅比、至歲底爲一百七十羅比、印棉在華市塲　價求　之情形、可見疲弱之象三品美棉亦隨美棉與紗市而進退、至三品紗之跌風亦殊猛烈蓋對華以（一）滙充不合算（二）中國内地情形不寗、輸出不振、而紗　續有增加、雖　　减工、而紗市存底月有增加之報告、三月間印度　增征保裘關　、日本製品又受　大之打擊、困難之形勢更甚、至六月二十四日跌至九十八元五角、此爲民四以來之低價較之一月間一百八十三元六角之最高峰、　及其半嗣即回漲、然仍徘徊於一百三四十元之間總之十九年紗市、中國固屬　順而世界　形正復相同、且尤甚於中國此絕爲國際間經濟狀况之順唐所致二十年之趨勢　頼　唐景象之　否而進退也茲將世界主要花紗市况列下、</p>
<p>（二）兩年來花紗價之比較</p>
<p>十九年世界花紗市均屬萎疲、已略如上述、且其趨勢、除三品紗中途暴落後稍即回漲外、餘均　　自歲初成直線的低落、較之十八年情形除中棉稍平外、莫不有巨差、茲再將二年來中外花紗價比較如下、</p>

<h3>油市結賬前之桐油市</h3>
<p>自國府頒行國歷、商業因結賬困難、故延至二月中旬、各業營業亦告停頓、白桐油洋　銷塲與結賬本無關係、惟因漢口行家以結束之期、必須整理、故對於交易不免受停市之　肘、當　初時、駐漢洋行尙辦去二三百噸、價格自二十一兩五六錢跌至二十兩○八錢洋規、市面之所以低落者、大槪係售者受結賬之影響、對此價格、有有售有不售之别、内銷本在　順期内、聞漢行收盤爲十九兩洋例　、本埠各號家對内銷近年來久已仗浙桐爲挹注、以漢桐　作參看市面之依據而已、與實際上似少關係、蓋亦市塲之變遷也、而浙桐收盤似在每担二十九元、送申或有不肯售者、亦各　口味耳、而各號　人本　來進者亦　、大約亦因結賬期近、須依銀根寛緊爲轉移也、各家存貨厚薄互見、多者有四五千担、少者只數百担洪江桐油存　統市約七八千桶、理客貨在内、市情平定、秀山桐油存底極薄、統市　千餘桶、預料開市非加價不可、停市數日均忙於結束、盈虧未有所聞、惟表面觀察、全年營業、以秋季受創爲最甚、　結果獲利殊艱也、</p>
<h3>絲茶全滬絲廠紛紛停工</h3>
<p>本埠各絲廠因見廠絲歐銷稍起、絲價轉漲、紛紛借　開工、以應市需、詎　花一現未满旬餘即告疲滯、絲價　跌百餘兩、而乾　貨　價昂、絲本仍重、海外來價甚小、廠商虧本難售、廠中開支活大、政府救濟公書發行尙需時日、支持無力、已開工之瑞綸等　十餘家絲廠、均於十四日起一體停工、須俟政府公　發下再行開工云、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢絨新貨續有進口</h3>
<p>轉運大連者甚夥</p>
<p>自二月一日至今呢絨貨續有進口、總數聞共有二千數百　、其間切爲春銷薄貨、爲直貫呢·嗶嘰·花呢·華特呢等、花色貨與雨衣布亦不少、均已下棧、其中繼續轉口運往大連者甚夥、按四月一日起裝往大連之貨、不得再收回稅、故同業均預先運輸也、</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>顧昂若譯</p>
<p>我立刻趕加歇龍地方、下午七時到我的司令部、我組織一個參謀部、即請混合軍團司令漢包特將軍來指揮第九軍、自從戰事爆發、注靑年軍官最爲鎭靜最有判斷力、並且最有毅力最有决策、我同他將一节重要事件解决、我對莣縣知事歇坡龍君相依不捨的說聲再會、就在下午十時出發　新、其餘的僚屬遲幾天出發、乘着摩托車長夜漫漫的前進、道路遭砲火轟毁得騎嶇不平、河上的橋樑纔草草的修好、各處的村落、殘壁斷垣、早已不成個樣子了、</p>
<p>我們的路程起先經過芒河的戰塲、再經過孟脫米拉義和米亞、過了河我們行遇沃爾克戰場、再經過聖里和塞勒義、渡過沃義斯河、行遇克羅孟聖巨嚚西、最後則白勒義已是十月五日侵晨五時半鐘了、</p>
<p>我立刻通知克斯德爾謊將軍找到了、在等候他的時候、我倒在一個學校裏的凳上休息、没有好久他進來了、從此我就接過指揮北線的戰事的責務、</p>
<h3>法蘭特之戰</h3>
<p>馬爾納河之戰（前譯作芒河之戰）之後就是歐洲大戰的第二期呌做「向海邊競進」、這個名稱似乎好聽、眞實能不發揮出作戰的眞意、且也不能眞眞的反對出作戰所根據的計劃、這次戰爭實在是向敵人競進、我們所希望包抄的是敵人的右翼、我們所已經避免的也是敵人包抄、因爲敵人曾想趕速包抄我們、其戰略同我們的不謀而合、因此雙方齊向北翼競進、</p>
<p>同時我們不得不阻止敵人的前進、使他們在其餘的戰事上不能移動、這戰綫遂逐漸的拉長、因此相同的戰略的結果、北翼的開展經過義爾地法蘭西·畢卡特萊·亞篤亞·及法蘭特·以至北海·非常敏疾、這樣北海雖則不是止標但是已成兩軍戰略的終點、</p>
<p>兩軍互相包抄·沿綫一再接觸、迄無解决的結果、末了、進兵到北海進無可進、遂發生負普里斯之戰、這役雙方想用全力急遽的衝破臨時作成的防綫以謀獲得一個解决、</p>
<p>競侬足足一個月之後、聯軍曾在馬爾内擊潰敵人的進攻、現又在頁石爾河岸阻止敵人的前進、並且救誮了海峽的各商埠、聯軍的陣地因之鞏固、英法的聯合因之團結、假使他們不能以决戰擊潰德軍、他們至少能使敵人無計可施無隙可乘、</p>
<p>大戰、尤其是幾個聯盟國所參加的、甚至包含幾次劇烈戰鬥、决不能以參戰的各個軍隊的觀點而論、大戰是合許多互相有關係的戰鬥面成的總體、雖則經過長時間和大空間、必須前後呼應彼此調和、方得收獲最後的良好的結果、</p>
<p>倘使有一方面停頓了、或者一支軍隊特别的經遠了亞戰、全軍的司令官必定要毅然决然的維持他全部的計劃、同時要鼓勵着支撑着頽廢的一角、絕不能承認放棄全局、或者以其弱點而抛棄或改變計劃、一支軍隊在某時間雖則受了重創、絕不能以此驚擾其餘的軍隊的共同的動作、或者影響保護全部聯軍的利益的戰局、</p>

<h3>希望</h3>
<p>唐荄</p>
<p>在我們靑春時代、分外的、需要異性、</p>
<p>當每次校中招生的時候、也在學期快要開始的時候、誰與誰遇到了、或者遇到老書記曹先生了、總是這樣的問、</p>
<p>「我們班裡有女生嗎、」</p>
<p>這個重大的問題、誰都要在來開課之前、求着曹先生解釋了清楚的、</p>
<p>要是班裏有了女生的說話、就三步併着兩步走、跳躍起來、好像戰士從戰塲上得到勝利一般、眼睛圓圓的睜着、向着許多去探望班裡有否有女生　　敗歸來的同學驕視、</p>
<p>過去的本校、在每一學期開始遲遲早早、先先後後、總見到幾個女士姍姍地分散到各班裡去上課的、班裏没有女士的同學、只能垂着液、懷着鬼胎、在有女生的敎室門首、踱來踱去走幾趟、</p>
<p>雖然我的話、覺得太過了一點、可是自家與自家、不可相瞒、</p>
<p>姍　姍起初誰都非常的渴望、本級有女生光臨、可是到了有了女生以後、又感覺到受拘束、煩悶、</p>
<p>誰也不知道這許多革履、旗袍的女士、是個摩登其外、不摩登其内的人物、</p>
<p>坐着上課、一動也不動、先生問的時候、含羞半語、老是紅着嫩白的面皮、開起級會來時候、很難得芳蹝來臨、要是她高興來參加的話、也是默無一聲、只有、只有當她們下課跑回寢室去的時候、在樓下的我們、才獲聽　聲、</p>
<p>一天除了上課外、絕對看不見她們在校園裏跑的、與我們不知在什麽時候築起一條高原的牆來、</p>
<p>我們本來是無所顧忌、關於性的問題、一到下課、就凑在一塊兒、高擱着雙脚、大談而特談的、可是自從她們來了以後、覺得無形之中、多了一位敎師監察一般、一點也不敢說了、</p>
<p>只悔氣了敎師、我們幾個頑皮的同學、藉着縣河似的口、絞盡了腦汁、去想許多難題來、難倒先生、引女士們一笑、以期自家的影子、鑽進女士們的芳心裏去、只可憐有時敎師紅着面大聲喊、「閙來」、有時也白着唇、一響不響、</p>
<p>現在學期又開始了、今天去上課、看見了一個不認得的新女士、坐在牆角的一旁、默一作聲的聽着講、满面的白粉、　着兩條漆黑的眉毛、我們都互相以嘴動了一動、徵笑一會、表示安琪兒降臨、新生命始了、不過是否會像以前一樣的、隔離我們、天呵、</p>
<h3>叙餐</h3>
<p>「本社爲謀聯社員間情感起見、經幹事會議决、於　月　日假座　　　西菜社、舉行叙餐、尙希本社社員躍踴參加、共襄盛舉、</p>
<p>汉政學院光明學社　月　日這是我們平日爲砥礪學行而組織的一個學術團體的通告、一天、清早上、我一跨進學校的大門、就迎面的看見了、我細細的溫了一遍之後、心田突然叢生了一種莫名的欣喜的感覺、那叙餐的情景彷彿照映在我的眼廉前了、又彷彿我已撲住了似的、我呆了一回、遙見我們的常務委員漢也挾着講義夾來了、我們便招呼爲禮、他接着就袖出了叙餐會的簽名簿、婉聲地說、</p>
<p>「叙餐會請你簽一個名」、</p>
<p>「好的」、</p>
<p>於是在二元的數量上、便决定了我也是參加的一員了、</p>
<p>第二天午刻、我和利在學校對過的館子中餐、適巧玉也在、談起了叙餐之進行的順利問題、因爲在這幾天來大家都已像在期着叙餐時刻的到來了、玉也是負責者的一員、因之他是能知内中的情形的、</p>
<p>「參加的人多嗎」、</p>
<p>「很多、是不會失望的」、</p>
<p>「女同學有嗎」、</p>
<p>「有、多不能保險、大槪五位之數」、</p>
<p>無意間、笑就這樣的在我們間撤下了一個長的存留、</p>
<p>那期望着的一天光臨了、我約好了劍同行的、但待到五時半、黝黯的色澤漸漸罩籠了、依然不見人影的來到、我便决定獨行了、在路上、平安地、</p>
<p>·········我踏進了那龐然的建築物、</p>
<p>一個白衣的使者、引我進内、則　·劍·玉·利·白·漢··········都已在了、其他不認識的尙不少、寒喧了一陣、我開始注意到各人面部的表情、紅潤欣愉、顯赫地展露着、加以湖色的燈光、匀潔地逼視、更内蘊了一種詩意的情調、我似乎满意的徹展了笑臉、這一班旺於靑春之大的驕子呵、</p>
<p>但是、當我注意到性别的分野、我不覺微微感到失望的意態、「今晚没　兩性的融和均調其間了、」在事實上、濃厚趣味之减少、面且我也懷疑、難道是女同學的懼畏、如果是這樣、那又何必要此集團生活呢、或者、是其他的緣故吧、</p>
<p>正當我作那樣感想的時候、終於在羣雄之中發現了一位伷女　范女士了、</p>
<p>於是欣悅的濃烈像重振了一下、</p>
<p>劍曾打電話回學校、邀郭女士她們來的、結果却枉然、這樣、大家對於范女士之僅來、越表示了敬佩的感忱了、</p>
<p>范女士刀固辭的在衆口讚美的聲中、頷首、接受、</p>
<p>經過了數度的催促、在　的臉上已是發現了爲難的表情了、我們决定不再等誰、而開始我們的工作、</p>
<p>本來叙餐就是尋樂的表示、正如　所說的、「叙餐比任何吃都有趣、掏的是自己的錢、可以没有拘束、」所謂狼呑虎咽、說笑打趣、都是必須有的成分了、有什麽顧忌、同時也祇有這樣才眞是盡情的狂歡哩、</p>
<p>我們鋪起白布在胸前、兩手把銀色的手又緊緊地執着、萄葡酒、白蘭地、满满的斟、丨乾了、再斟······</p>
<p>漢丨主席把叙餐的意義報告了、來了、他要求每個人發表一種意見、</p>
<p>是劍開的塲、第二輪到　了、他表示反對、理由是這樣、</p>
<p>「今晚是叙餐、我們不需要會議的方式來在此做作、我反對主席的意見、希望主席即速收回成命······」</p>
<p>無異議的通過、</p>
<p>話題便轉到别一方向、白提議每人</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>報告艷史一則、結果把人分成三部份已婚的、有對象的、無對象的、檢點的結果、</p>
<p>已婚的占四分之一、於是已婚的便自成了一個壁壨、向未婚的實行進攻、</p>
<p>「我們已婚的、簡直也是靑春的年齡逝了、無須報告、你們未婚的却盡當報告、如果在你們進行步驟上發現有失策的地方、我們當盡指導之責、」錚自私地而又似乎善意地說、</p>
<p>自然在他方面、未能答應、爭辨就經過了長時期、</p>
<p>「現在、我們要玉把戀愛鸣報告、」白在爭辨中、另闢了一個門徑、</p>
<p>大家贊成、但玉祇是知、他不願當衆報告的樣子、雖然他的心田上如何是不得而知的、</p>
<p>「那末、我來代爲報告、白自告奮勇」</p>
<p>地、</p>
<p>於是、白很巧妙地說了一大篇、當然聽者是笑不可仰、</p>
<p>一個一個地問過去、在被問者都不免飛上紅雲、錚更是健談、他發問一般未婚者、這是輪到范女士了、</p>
<p>「你有否對象、」</p>
<p>「没有」范女士在嚴重的請問下、很自然的答語、</p>
<p>「爲什麽没有、」</p>
<p>「因爲不求、」</p>
<p>「爲什麽不求、」</p>
<p>「不需要、」</p>

<p>疲憊的神情在各人的懺維上滋長起來了、似乎已得了满足的收獲、大家都不約而同的轉到言師這標題來、但又不忍這樣急的離去、稀有的傾晤、那能放鬆了這種機會、</p>

<h3>新敎師</h3>
<p>榆</p>
<p>在還没有打上課鐘以前、我們都已走進了第二選科敎室、急切地等待着這位敎政治學槪論的新敎師來到、</p>
<p>起初、我們彼此的心中都彷彿以爲這新敎師是一個年紀很靑的、或者是一個中年的有十足政治氣味的男敎師、因爲在這「政治」二字上使我們不得不意識到這上面、後來、在敎務主任口中才知道這是一位同性的女敎師、姓克的、於是、我們却又要猜想她是怎麽的一個人了、</p>
<p>「我想、她一定帶有些男子氣的」、</p>
<p>「我想、她一定很有口才、並且會說上一口很漂亮很流利的國語」、</p>
<p>「我想、她一定不是一個庸俗的女子」</p>
<p>「總之、我想、她的學識、她的舉止、</p>
<p>她的一切都好的、或者、她正是可以代表近時代的女子的典型也未可知、因爲我曾聽說她很不錯」、</p>
<p>這一個新敎師丨我們不相識的一位新敎師、已在我們恣意的閒談中彷彿肯定了、我們都很满意地等着上課鐘送我們這想像中的敎師進來、</p>
<p>上課鐘是打了、樓梯處起了一陣皮鞋咯咯聲、我們的新敎師終於給敎務主任送在敎室門口了、然而、一頭把髮油塗得很光亮的　頸的長髮、一張把脂粉塗得有紅有白的臉上架了一副黑邊的眼鏡丨大約是平光的、一件黑色軟緞的長袍、鑲着烏黑的皮、領口處有二粒很鮮目的大紅水鑽紐子、袍子是很緊、大約是太省儉了衣料、把胸部和臂部都很明顯地凸起了、脚下一雙跟很高的烏絨的靴子、啊、這一位、這一位我們切望的新敎師是走進了敎室、她先把給眉炭畫得很長的眉蹙了一蹙、再微知地向我們點了黠頭、</p>
<p>我們交上了選科證、雖然每一張上除了各人的名字外都印着同樣的字、但她仍細細的每張看了一遍、足足化去了五分鐘以上的時光、她才開口了丨聲音有很輕很輕、敎室衷靜得連鼻涕的聲音都没有時、才能使坐在後面的同學聽見、大約她是知道自己的聲音輕、恐怕我們聽不清楚、所以她老是把一句話要說上三四遍、她說、「我今天能見到各位同學是很高興、我是剛在大學裏畢業、所以講到學識和經　實在是一些也没有、現在可以和諸位同學相討論相切磋、所以我也很高興」、她講完了前一句話要等好一會才能把下面的一句話說出、所以這些話她足足又說了有一刻鐘、</p>
<p>過後、她告訴了我們用什麽書、要我們在下點鐘一定要帶來、最後她說、「現在我們隨意來談談吧」、</p>
<p>一個同學就問、「現在美國國内分什麽黨」、</p>
<p>「分二個黨派」、</p>
<p>「那二個」、</p>
<p>「分二個黨派」、</p>
<p>連問了二三遍、她只是這麽的回答、</p>
<p>「那現在美國總統胡佛是那一黨呢」她又紅又白的粉臉上却又抺上了些胭脂、</p>
<p>「共和黨、」一個嘴快的同學搶着說了出來、</p>
<p>她把含感謝意的秋波向這位嘴快的同學瞟了一瞟說、「是的、」</p>
<p>大約她是怕我們再問下去了、就很快的接下說、「我今天第一次和同學見面」</p>
<p>、想同學們一定不知道我、我來自己介紹吧、「她說她在北方住了十多年、前年才到上海來進　　大學的文科、本在今年暑假畢業、爲了學分已满、所以在這寒假畢業了、過後又說了不少什麽没有學問没有經騐的話來、一面說一面却不時的伸進袋去摸出一隻白色的掛錶來看、大約是怕時間過得太快、她的話要來不及說完罷、</p>
<p>果然、這位新敎師實在是一位合於我們想像中飽學的敎師、她告訴我們、「她在大學裏第一學年讀了怎樣厚怎樣厚的一本什麽書、第二學年第三學年·····讀了多厚多厚的一本書丨書名是說的很長很長的外國名字、我們聽不懂、書的厚薄是她把二指表示給我們看的、實在、怎不使人敬佩呢、她讀的書每本都有「英華合解字彙」般厚、</p>
<p>大約她是怕我們坐得太久了對於身體上不宜、所以雖然下課鈴還没有響、她說、「今天是第一點鐘、我們就早些退課吧、」</p>
<p>這位飽學的新敎師終於飄然的離開我們而下樓了、只有她粉白脂紅的臉還仍在我們的腦海中搖　、</p>

<h3>The Problem of Precious Gold and Cheap Silver and the United Kingdom and the United States</h3>
<p>The trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap. Even today, it is still progressing every day. Although there are many ways to remedy it. But to this day. We have not yet seen an effective way. Then, when will this tumultuous trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap finally settle down? It must wait until one day when the standard of the gold and silver exchange ratio can be accurately compromised and set. Then the trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap will begin to settle down. This is a global trend that cannot be manipulated or remedied by human power. There must be a world</p>
<p>law that people can jointly abide by. Then, we can bring this trend into a certain range. In this way, it is necessary to determine a standard of gold and silver price ratio. If not, then there is no such thing as gold being expensive or silver being cheap. How high will the expensive be? How cheap will the cheap be? Neither can be predicted by modern people. Although. This method of proportional pricing has not been said by anyone. Why can't it be done when it is said? Because the countries rich in gold and silver have their own claims. Countries rich in gold have different claims from countries rich in silver. The London market. The vision is also different from the vision of the New York market. Differences cannot cooperate to determine this standard. Today, the London telegram said that the British Parliament discussed the US government's request to attend a meeting to restore the price of silver. The Minister of Finance, Snowden, believes that the British government does not need to initiate this matter. Only countries with greater relations initiate and convene international conferences. Then Britain will not lag behind. His words on whether to approve the US request are not clear. However, he is very willing to agree to convene an international conference. It has been seen that the main goal of international conferences that can be successful must be to discuss the standard of this gold and silver price ratio. If all countries sincerely cooperate to seek to remedy this trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, the main goal must be for all countries to work together to speed up the formation of this international conference.</p>

<h3>The Position of the King of Spain is Isolated and Precarious</h3>
<p>Various Factions Decline to Form a Cabinet</p>

<p>Madrid, 17th - Gerra, the former leader of the left-wing Conservative Party, has returned to the King, saying that he is unable to form a cabinet and recommended Arvarez, the leader of the Reform Party, to replace him. It is heard that Gerra refused to form a cabinet because he wanted the King to sign a temporary order with the deputy left-wing request in order to help induce moderate elements in the Republican Party to cooperate with the government, but was rejected by the King. In addition, Arvarez has also refused to form a cabinet, and the situation is becoming more complicated. It is rumored that the King intends to try to form an imperial cabinet, with Berenger as Prime Minister and most of his cabinet members as former cabinet members.

Therefore, he telegraphed again to invite Li to come to Shenyang first, and also telegraphed Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu to take a detour to Beiping on his way to Shenyang to accompany Li. After Li and Hu met, they immediately telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang, reporting the departure date. On the evening of the 13th, he departed from Ping and arrived in Shenyang on the overnight express train of the Beining Railway at 7:35 pm on the 14th. Liu Yifei, Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, and Wang Shuchang, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, both arrived in Shenyang on the same train that evening due to Zhang's summons to discuss the financial budget of the province. That night, Hu, Wang, and Liu all went to see Zhang, and Zhang also met with Li that night. In addition, Wen Shouquan arrived in Shenyang the day before yesterday. At 5:00 pm on the 14th, he met with Deputy Commander Zhang and reported his opinions on the aftermath in Shanxi and that his trip north and south was purely a matter of personal conscience and that he hoped that the aftermath in Shanxi would be resolved once and for all.

<h3>Yanbian Japanese Police Arbitrarily Arrest Registered Korean People</h3>
<p>Communist Bandits Attempt to Disrupt the Jidun Railway</p>
<p>Harbin Communication, Although the conflict between the Yanji garrison and the Japanese police has been resolved through direct negotiations with the Jilin authorities, the police of the Wu Brigade dispatched by the Governor-General of Korea have not been completely withdrawn. There are still more than a hundred people staying in the Longbing Village Toudaogou area, and every week a team of armed police of about fifty people is sent to patrol various parts of Yanbian, ostensibly to investigate the Korean Communist Party. Wherever they go, they arbitrarily invade and harass the residences of Chinese and Korean people. The authorities do not want to start negotiations again and have not yet protested. In Mutingzi, Toudaogou, Han Shengyi, Park Taewon, and Choi Yoonbeom, who have been registered as residents for many years, live there. The local police know this very well. However, at noon on the 9th of this month, more than a dozen Japanese police officers, fully armed, suddenly broke into the residences of the two people and pointed out that Park and Choi were the leaders of the Communist Party. They searched the homes of the two people. Although they did not obtain any evidence, they wanted to take the two people to the office. Jiang Yaodong, the patrol officer of our local police station, received a letter and rushed to the police to negotiate with the Japanese police, informing them that the police station had not been notified in advance, and that the arrested people were registered Korean people. According to custom, they must be handed over to us for interrogation first. Unless necessary, they must not be extradited. This time, Park and Choi must also be handed over to the Chinese side for interrogation before discussing whether to extradite them. The Japanese police refused. The two sides held on for a long time. The Japanese police suddenly pushed the prisoners out of the room and each took out weapons, forming a skirmish line on the high slope, threatening our police not to move. Fearing that Patrol Officer Jiang would lead the crowd to follow behind, they also pushed Jiang down the car with two Korean people and drove away. After driving for a while, they pushed Jiang out of the car and left. Afterwards, a protest was filed by the negotiator, but there was no result. This is the general situation of the Japanese police's disturbance. A few days ago, the Governor-General of Korea sent Yang Hezuo, an administrative officer, to Yanbian to investigate. All the places that could be used for police stations were thoroughly investigated. It is speculated that they may use the name of preventing the Korean Communist Party and add armed police. As for the Korean Communist bandits, they use Dahuanggou near Wangqing County as a base and harass and plunder everywhere, making the residents feel uneasy. One battalion of the 13th Brigade Jixing's unit went to suppress them a few days ago. The place is quite important, and it is difficult to determine whether it will be effective. Another part of the Korean Communist bandits are scattered on the Jidun and Tiantu lines, trying to sabotage transportation. Therefore, driving on the two roads has been very dangerous in the past ten days. The provincial government has sent the Wang Regiment of the 15th Division to deploy defenses. In addition, the headquarters of the 15th Division stationed in Longjing Village cracked a Korean Communist Party on the 8th of this month, capturing more than 30 male and female Communist bandits, and has sent them to the provincial government for interrogation. The people of Yanbian are very uneasy under the double harassment of the Japanese and Korean police and bandits. (13th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Orders Special Protection of the Eurasia Air Route</h3>
<p>Shenyang Communication, Minister of Communications Wang Boqun sent a telegram yesterday to Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, requesting that the affiliated units be notified to provide special protection for the Eurasia traffic that is about to open. After receiving the telegram, Zhang has notified the affiliated units to provide special protection and provide convenience. The telegram from Minister Wang recorded the following: "The Eurasia Aviation Company and the northbound lines of the China Aviation Company, which have been approved by the National Government, are ready for trial operation. The military and police in Pingjin have been notified to protect the opening of the Beijing-Ping line of the China Aviation Company. Now the Eurasia air route has been set to open in early March this year, passing through Duolun to Manzhouli along the Beijing-Ping line. I plan to go to Beiping Nanyuan and Manzhouli to prepare everything in the existing stations and find a place to build a flying field in Duolun. I respectfully request you, my brother, to protect and notify the affiliated units to provide special protection and convenience. Wang Boqun."</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan Expresses Unwillingness to Be an Official</h3>
<p>Striving to Handle Relief Affairs</p>
<p>Beiping Communication, Zhu Qinglan, the newly appointed member of the Supervisory Yuan, arrived in Tianjin from Tangshan on the evening of the 12th and arrived in Ping from Tianjin on the 13th. The reporter recently visited Zhu at the Relief Office. According to Zhu, this trip to the Northeast was to contact the purchase and transportation of relief food for the disaster area in western Liaoning. I have turned from Jinzhou to inspect various counties in Suizhong. The flood disaster is almost over. The Liugu River, which caused the accident this time, is too narrow. In the future, we should find a way to widen it to facilitate the flow, otherwise the disaster will be inevitable. However, this project is huge, and I hope the authorities will pay attention to it and handle it together. That is the biggest problem. The disaster relief in Liaoning is generally in order and I plan to go to Shaanxi again soon. The number of people in the porridge factories in the disaster area in Shaanxi is increasing day by day. It is expected that the factories will be closed after the wheat harvest in May. The government recently allocated 50,000 yuan from the cigarette tax to Shaanxi and ordered it to be used carefully. As for the 8 million public bonds, there is no news of issuance yet. The cement materials used for the Diaozui diversion project have been ordered from Qixin Cement Company in Tangshan for 20,000 bags and will be transported to Shaanxi soon for construction, etc. The reporter then asked whether Zhu would take office, since the Supervisory Yuan recently announced Zhu's appointment as a member. Zhu replied that many friends have recently asked me about this matter, but I have not heard anything about it beforehand. I am handling relief affairs and have no time to be an official. (14th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Establishes Narcotics Suppression Committee</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: In recent years, narcotics such as "white pills," "golden pills," morphine, and heroin have been ten times more harmful to our country than opium. Shandong Province, due to the Japanese along the Jiaoji Railway line specializing in trafficking these narcotics, has suffered even more severely than other provinces. Qingdao, Fangzi, Zhoucun, and Jinan are also major manufacturing centers for narcotics, selling them throughout the province. The most widespread areas are Dongchang, Caozhou, northern Shandong, and areas near Jinan. According to investigations, one in fifty people in Shandong Province are addicted to narcotics. Out of the province's 40 million people, 800,000 are addicted. Each person spends one yuan per day, resulting in a daily loss of 800,000 yuan, a monthly loss of 24 million yuan, and an annual loss of approximately 300 million yuan. The magnitude of this loss is truly alarming. Moreover, after becoming addicted to narcotics, individuals become useless, posing a greater threat than bandits and communists. The Shandong Provincial Government previously implemented strict prohibitions, but they were ineffective. Drug addicts were forced into addiction treatment centers. Ma Liang, the former commander of the Second Border Defense Division, was appointed as the chairman of the Shandong Narcotics Suppression Committee, which was established with a monthly budget of 2,800 yuan. The organization includes an investigation department, headed by a chief investigator and several investigators, to work with local street chiefs and police to investigate narcotics users and encourage them to quit, with the aim of eliminating narcotics.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Old Lunar Customs Difficult to Eradicate: In this city, various old customs related to the end of the old lunar year and the beginning of the new year were initially subject to a strict prohibition order issued by the County Government at the request of the County Party Affairs Rectification Committee. Unexpectedly, as the date arrived, everything remained the same. On the 17th, which was the beginning of the lunar new year, all stores uniformly closed. Although social customs were slightly modified compared to previous years, they could not be completely eradicated. However, all government offices and schools remained open as usual. The County Public Security Bureau, in order to eradicate old customs, issued a six-character notice, stating, "The lunar new year has arrived, vulgarity should be eradicated. Stores should remain open, do not adhere to old customs."</p>
<p>Seventy-Year-Old Man Detained for Smoking Opium: Hu Yunjun, a resident of Tian Shang Shi Qiao Town in the fifth district of this county, celebrated his seventieth birthday on the 17th.

On the 16th, he was arrested by the chief of the 17th branch of the Public Security Bureau and sent to the County Public Security Bureau. The next day, he was transferred to the County Court, where he was interrogated by Prosecutor Zhou. Later, after Hu requested bail, it was approved upon payment of a 500-yuan cash bond.</p>

In addition to the bodies of nine men and women, including He Hehang, which have already been recovered, another body was discovered on the 16th. It was learned that the deceased's name was Yang Jiaohuan, a resident of Daqiangmen Town, 58 years old. His son, Bai Sheng, works at the Xin Fengxiang Silver Shop outside the South Gate. After receiving the news, he rushed to embrace the body and weep. The third branch of the Public Security Bureau reported the incident to the County Court Prosecutor's Office, which dispatched Prosecutor Zhu to conduct an investigation. A wooden tag with the number 10 was attached to the body, awaiting identification and collection by the family. All cash and belongings found on the bodies the day before were kept at the Prosecutor's Office in accordance with the numbers on the cloth bags, awaiting collection.

Some businesses, in order to follow the national calendar, did not close, such as money exchanges handling foreign currency rates and pawnshops handling pledges. Even silk and cloth shops and watch stores remained open, but business was unusually slow.

<h3>District Education Associations Established Successively</h3>
<p>Preparations for the Third District Special Zone</p>
<p>Recently, educational circles in the city have been paying attention to the organization of district education associations. Since educational colleagues from Zhabei, Nanshi, Jiangwan, and other districts took the lead in initiating preparations, various districts have also been proceeding one after another. It is known that the District Education Association of the Third District (i.e., the First Special Zone) has also been initiated by more than 30 people, including Zhou Darong, Tang Demin, Zhou Shangen, Zhang Tianbai, Zhu Yingpeng, Tang Liqing, Xu Huimin, Jin Xing, Gui Xilin, Qi Jinsheng, Qian Xuanqing, Fan Mingyao, Li Fengming, Yuan Yeyu, Gao Deben, Ding Guocui, Shao Shunmin, Qian Yisu, and Yuan Yun. They have jointly submitted a request to the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters for permission to establish it. Once the permit is issued, a founding convention will be held.</p>
<p>The Education Association Law has been promulgated by the National Government. Chu Minyi, president of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology, and others have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Special District Education Association, which will hold a founding convention on the 20th.

<h3>Zheng Hongnian's Discussion on Jida School Affairs</h3>
<p>Cultivate Pure Thinking Through Rigorous Training</p>
<p>Achieve Hao Hao as in Hao Hao Through Zhen Zhi Zhen Jian</p>
<p>Zheng Hongnian, president of National Jinan University, recently made the following remarks regarding Jida school affairs:</p>
<p>"I personally handle all matters, large and small, concerning Jida school affairs. This semester, due to financial difficulties, we have implemented austerity measures, reducing the number of staff by dozens, streamlining finances, auditing expenditures, clarifying authorities in purchasing, and eliminating malpractices. We are working to improve health and medical services. However, what I am most concerned about is training students, especially those in the middle school division. I sincerely hope that teachers will supervise and encourage students to study hard, conduct rigorous examinations, and that the training department will put effort into actively training students and cultivating pure thinking. Modern youth are often interested in studying social problems and trends, which is not surprising. However, if Chinese society cannot satisfy the Chinese people, will Western societies satisfy the whole world? I do not believe this to be the case. Some people pick up outdated ideas from others, change the names, and call it 'New Proletarian Literature.' Upon closer examination, it is extremely superficial. The progress of Chinese language is rapid, and compared to it, this is a regression. I have also read more than a dozen of these books. One of them, called 'Art Popularization,' advocates drumming as good music. However, it is not well known that China had Yu Zhao's music and the five-stringed zither as early as the time of Tang and Yu. Try singing songs like 'Not knowing, not understanding, following the laws of the Emperor,' and you will feel that Chinese music is like what Mencius called 'Hao Hao Ru Ye.' Chinese music with eight tones in harmony is the way of kings, while Western music with heavy metal is the way of despots, only reaching 'Huan Yu Ru Ye.' In the future, we should achieve true knowledge through scientific methods. In the past, we achieved Hao Hao through not knowing and not understanding. From now on, we should achieve Hao Hao through true knowledge and true understanding. If everyone can understand the truth and follow a clear path, then everything will be solved, naturally achieving Hao Hao. If we can guide students along this path, preventing them from being influenced by ideas that seem right but are wrong, seemingly progressive but actually regressive, then we can achieve the true meaning of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of Livelihood. The desire of young people to learn is high, and reasonable demands should not be suppressed. Teachers should comfort their desires, satisfy their needs, and guide them to the right path. It is hoped that teachers will provide more guidance outside of class. As for Jida's academic publications, such as the Liberal Arts College Journal and the Education College Quarterly, they contain specialized and in-depth research that can be a model for the academic community. The recently established printing group will handle all printing matters for the school. Various academic works from the colleges, middle school division, and cultural department will also promote the school's style."</p>

<p>Seeing the article on the 12th, “The Loss of Liaozhi,” this is written hastily as an old friend of Cai:</p>
<p>Hearing you got a Song saliva vessel. Its name is Zuan, whether things exist or not. It’s true that this object came out of the capital. It’s not just to nourish Xia and pregnant Yu. As a vessel, it manifests the models. Although buried for a long time, it has left the wilderness. I don’t know who the mediocre servant of Mo is. The writing of the golden classics is timid to copy. There is also a picture of farming and weaving. The Ming Dynasty’s handwriting is not blurred. Having this, I don’t need to seek the fine jade. Even if it is not as good as the Ding Tripod or Pan Yu Vessel. Moreover, the value is more than 50,000. The ancient colors are mottled and dazzling like golden beads. There is no missing corner. It’s black like lacquer, with a special luster. The middle is convex and smooth like butter. Begonia flowers reflect around, blooming. The flower color is white and warm like jade. It’s as precious as the coral plant of the Shi family. Next to it is a landscape red brocade shop. It’s as beautiful as a cockscomb with red cinnabar dots. It’s as green as jade with dew. Fresh and dripping with fragrant pulp. Treasures and magical instruments compete to call. All admire this at once. There is no place to hide it in the bed, my heart hesitated. I looked around and lacked help. I just want to sit and lie with it. I was shocked and confused, losing my joy. After thinking about it in every way, I felt stupid. I covered it over and over again, frequently looking at it anxiously. Unexpectedly, the cold and heat were in a moment. It was made of mud. The water froze and broke like a horn. It was bursting and worn without completeness. I hugged this pot day and night. I only sighed and grieved in vain. Do I know how I feel now? The rise and fall of all things is like a great furnace. One success and one destruction are multiplied and divided. I don’t ask if it’s fine jade or Wuyu jade. Moreover, the earth axis is like a pulley. The north and south of the Yangtze River became suburbs and ruins. Who covets the golden plate and jade mirror? The Qin bells and Han drums enter the mud. If I understand that creation has prosperity and decline. Why bother comparing the small amounts in the world? I chanted this in the snow window. I hope you treasure it and cherish it.</p>
<h3>A Discussion of the Customs of the Li People</h3>
<p>Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met an old friend, Yang Dexun. He recounted his recent trip to Guangdong with Chief of Staff Huang Mogong, Ai Zhibin, Tian Jinhai, Song Liang, and other comrades. They went to the Li settlements in southern Hainan Island to observe the lives and terrain of the Li people, hoping to enlighten their knowledge and plan the construction of roads. The situation they encountered was completely different from that of the mainland. Therefore, I have excerpted the following notes for the research of those who collect local customs: On October 7th, they departed from the Haikou garrison in Fucheng and headed towards Wenchang, Jiaji, Lingshui, and other counties. After more than twenty days, they arrived at Wuzhi Mountain (five peaks standing side by side, shaped like fingers, hence the name Wuzhi Mountain). This place is where the Li people reside. The roads are rugged and difficult to travel. The army could only travel about twenty miles each day. Along the way, coconut trees stand tall, which are the richest products of the area. Li men wear a piece of cloth to cover their genitals, with their upper bodies completely naked. Women also use a piece of cloth to cover their private parts, with their breasts hanging high, mingling among the crowd without any embarrassment. Their necks are filled with iron necklaces, as large as washbasins, heavy and cumbersome. Their earrings are made of lead, shaped like iron chains, barefoot and bare-armed. When they move, the necklaces collide and make sounds, which they consider a source of pride. The structure of their houses is very simple, mostly made of bamboo frames and covered with thatched roofs, like the grass sheds inhabited by the poor people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The interior arrangement is mostly bamboo-woven beds. People sleep on top, and pigs sleep below, creating a peculiar and foul smell that makes one want to vomit. Every morning, they pound rice as their work, with nothing else to do. The rice is red, coarse, and extremely poor quality. They do not grow vegetables. The poor often eat tree leaves with their meals, which is very difficult to swallow. Besides the six kinds of livestock—pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, geese, and ducks—they have nothing else. Marriage customs, it is said, are the same as in the savage era. There are no procedures such as engagement or wedding. A woman becomes the wife of any man who forcibly takes her. Therefore, there are often fights over women. The people of this area have no contact with the outside world. Therefore, this time, when we went there as a group, the Li people were all surprised and regarded us as celestial beings. The flashlights, needles, thread, phonographs, firecrackers, and other things we brought with us, which the Li people had never seen before, and could not understand the reasons for their light and sound, were all regarded as having mysterious powers. They stood around and stared, not leaving all day. Even those from far away came to watch in a continuous stream. The trading behavior in this area is all barter, similar to ancient times. Money is not circulated. When we ate their chickens and ducks and gave them money, they all turned their heads and ignored us. But when we gave them needles and thread, they were all happy to accept them. Most strangely, when we were about to leave, we gave them several mirrors. When they looked at their reflections in the mirror, they were initially very frightened, standing there like wooden chickens. Then, when they saw their own movements reflected in the mirror, they all regarded them as treasures and thanked us.</p>
<h3>### A Spider Saves Seven Lives</h3>
<p>Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Although spiders are tiny insects, they spin silk and weave webs with their own ingenuity. Duke of Jin praised their intelligence, and Taihao took them as teachers. They are not to be compared with ordinary crawling creatures. According to the research of zoologists, they have spinnerets at the end of their abdomens, which store a liquid similar to egg white. There are six or seven hundred tiny holes on it. When the body contracts, the liquid flows out of the tiny holes. It solidifies into extremely thin silk upon contact with the air. The silk forms a web, and the web becomes a nest. Butterflies and moths rely on this to feed themselves. Now, I have heard people recount the story of a spider saving seven lives, which is truly a rare tale of all time. But the story is said to be true and not fabricated. I might as well record it for the amusement of readers. Recently, Jiangxi Province suffered a communist disaster. There was a Wang Shuoqing, a prominent local gentry, with a wealthy family and beautiful gardens. Shuoqing was fond of elegance and roamed freely among them, much like the recluse of Xiangshan, who "carried poetry scrolls to tour the mountains and waters, and held wine cups to watch the moon and seek flowers." He extensively collected contemporary paintings and calligraphy, including works by the Four Wangs, Wu, and Yun, which were carefully mounted and treasured. Unexpectedly, the communist disaster suddenly broke out, with burning, looting, and killing everywhere. Wang, as a gentry, was naturally on the list of those to be eliminated. However, upon receiving the news, he was panicked and at a loss, with no place to escape. He had no choice but to enter a grotto in the rockery with his wife, three young children, and a maid, using the uneven terrain as a hiding place. The next morning, the communist army came to search. The gatekeeper and servants were all killed. They searched every room for Wang's whereabouts, but they all heard that he was nowhere to be found. Later, they searched to the entrance of the rockery grotto. The spiderwebs were densely spread. Regardless of whether a mud ball could seal Hangu Pass, the communist army wanted to enter. Suddenly, the leader of the team said, "The grotto is covered in spiderwebs, so it must be uninhabited. Since there is no tiger cub, there is no need to enter the den." The communist army obeyed and left with a roar. Wang's family of seven was saved. Some say that Wang's family had never killed living creatures for generations, and they never exterminated the spiders on the eaves and corners of the house. This is why they received such a great reward from the spiders. The old theory of cause and effect seems not to fit the new trends of today. People may say it casually, and I may listen to it casually.</p>
<h3>Gambling Costs a Wife</h3>
<p>Long</p>
<p>Every year at the end of the year, whether in cities, towns, or remote villages, mahjong and dice games are everywhere. The authorities do not prohibit it, and it is a scene of joy and celebration. How could one know that this would lead to a terrible tragedy? In Xinmiao, Nanyi, there are often some petty thieves who gather crowds to gamble and profit from it every New Year. Once, a nearby farmer named Shen Guisheng was also addicted to gambling. Because he lost repeatedly, he gradually took his wife's jewelry and secretly used it as gambling money. But he lost even more. There was nothing left to take. It escaped to the gold hairpin of the newly married wife, Wang. Wang was very angry and chased him to a small stone bridge about a mile away. Suddenly, she saw Guisheng jump into the water, and was extremely frightened and ran over. But she saw only bubbles like flowers, with no trace of him. She thought that her husband had been forced to drown. Her parents-in-law only had this one son. After wailing for a long time, she also resolutely jumped down, ending all her troubles and accompanying her husband.</p>
<p>Guisheng was familiar with water and swam to the shore several miles away at the bottom of the river. He borrowed clothes from a relative and changed into them. He leisurely spent half a day. It was not until evening that he returned home and learned that his beloved wife had died. The Guisheng couple had deep love for each other and could not help but hug the corpse and cry bitterly, wishing they could die. From then on, they hated gambling like an enemy and never touched it again to atone for the deceased.</p>
<p>Long said, although this matter has already become a thing of the past, the harm of gambling is so great, and the number of gamblers in the world is not limited to Guisheng alone. Moreover, since the abolished lunar new year has arrived, I have specially brought it out in the hope that all gamblers and authorities in the world will be vigilant.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Impacts Railway Finances</h3>
<p>Railway Bureau is Seeking Relief Measures</p>
<p>In the past, during the period of military intervention, the military interfered in railway administration, arbitrarily seizing vehicles, resulting in a shortage of revenue and failure to repay principal and interest, which hindered credit. At the beginning of the establishment of the Ministry of Railways, it was originally intended to actively reform, but due to environmental factors, it was impossible to implement it for a while. Recently, the situation has stabilized, and politics have been unified, and reorganization is beginning. Unexpectedly, the sudden rise in gold prices has caused significant losses to various railways. The domestic railways were built with foreign debts, and gold pounds are used for the repayment of principal and interest and the purchase of materials, while all kinds of railway revenue are in silver dollars. This year alone, the price of gold has increased by more than double, while railway revenue remains the same. The dire situation is evident. The domestic railways with slightly better conditions are the Beining, Jiaoji, and Jinghu railways. However, the Jinghu Railway has a very short line and limited income. In the past, when the price of gold was stable, it could still be maintained. In recent years, the price of gold has soared, and difficulties have already arisen. At the same time, it is also necessary to improve various facilities along the line and replace sleepers. Therefore, this year's budget is seriously insufficient. The railway authorities have tried to save expenses as much as possible. However, railways are large-scale operations. Reducing expenses is important, but increasing revenue is even more indispensable. This time, the soaring gold prices have affected the whole world. It is difficult to remedy the situation without fundamentally increasing revenue. Therefore, in transportation, such as shipping, etc., gold yuan has already been collected, and the fares are as high as one yuan. The railway situation is the same, and it seems that timely relief should be given to avoid bankruptcy. The railway authorities are considering this issue.</p>
<h3>Copper Coin Exchange Rate Soars in the Past Two Days</h3>
<p>One Silver Dollar Exchanges for 220 Copper Coins</p>
<p>In the past two days, most of the shops in the city have not opened for business. Only tobacco shops, water stalls, and small restaurants opened for business yesterday morning, but the items sold were more expensive than usual, and the exchange rate of copper coins was particularly high. For example, one silver dollar could only be exchanged for five dimes (i.e., ten dimes), plus two copper coins, and each dime could only be exchanged for forty copper coins (400 cash). In total, one silver dollar was only worth 202 copper coins, i.e., 2,020 cash, which is 600 cash more than ten days ago. This is because most of the merchants have not opened for business, and a few shops are manipulating the market.</p>
<h3>South City Stores to Open Today</h3>

The Shanghai South East District Commercial Federation immediately printed and distributed a notice, urging all stores in the South City to open for business uniformly today.</p>
<h3>Business Tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Under Correction</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Responds to Various Industry Tax Rules Committees</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the various industry tax rules committees yesterday, saying: "Tax rules research committee of the Shanghai Municipal Industry Association: Your letter has been read. The collection of business tax in various provinces should be implemented after the complete abolition of Likin, as decided by the National Likin Conference in July of the Republic of China. Now that the central government has issued an order to abolish Likin in the country, the various provinces are implementing business tax to compensate for it, which is in line with the original plan. The exact amount of the loss of additional tax after the abolition of Likin in various provinces has not been reported by the financial departments of the various provinces, and it is not easy to find out. The association should directly petition the provincial government to investigate and approve it, and in accordance with Article 8 of the Business Tax Outline approved by the Executive Yuan and Article 10 of the Supplementary Regulations, when the business tax regulations and implementation rules of the various provinces are reported to the Ministry for review, the Ministry will have the power to review and revise the articles and reduce and exempt tax rates. The business tax regulations and rules of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been approved by the two provincial governments and sent to the Ministry, and are now being reviewed item by item. If there are any provisions that exceed the regulations approved by the Executive Yuan, the Ministry will correct them one by one in order to achieve fairness. In general, we hope that the tax system will be carefully discussed, and both sides will be taken care of. Now, according to the previous reason, we order the telegraph to be informed." Minister of Finance Song, sealed (New Sound Society).</p>

<h3>Strange Case of Hu Chaoyang's Wife and Concubine Eating</h3>
<p>Rice Changes Color, Is It Poisonous?</p>
<p>If There is Poison, Where Did It Come From?</p>
<p>Hu Chaoyang, from Bao Ying, used to work on a certain ship. His wife, Yao, is thirty years old and lives in a bungalow next to the Huabi Tobacco Company in Lujiawan. Hu is fond of women, so even after marrying his wife, he still fooled around outside. Soon, he took Xia as a concubine and organized a small family in Zhuhang Lane in Nanshi. Xia is twenty-two years old and from Changzhou. She is not ugly. Hu usually loves her very much, so he is very cold to his wife. On the 16th of this month, Hu ordered Yao to spend the New Year at Xia's residence. All the arrangements and meals were handled by Xia. They lived in peace for only two days. Yesterday morning at around 11 o'clock, for some reason, a conflict suddenly broke out between the wife and concubine. Liu Shaoyi, the watchman of the fourth post there, heard about it and rushed over, and brought the two to the first office of the first district. When the director of the office preliminarily interrogated the case, Yao said that Xia is my husband's mistress. These two days, my husband asked me to spend the New Year at his home. Unexpectedly, today, at lunchtime, after Xia brought me a bowl of rice, I only ate one bite and felt a strange sensation in my throat. When I examined it carefully and paid attention to the bowl of rice that Xia ate, it was snow-white, while my bowl of rice was yellow. It is clear that Xia intentionally put poison in my rice bowl in an attempt to harm my life. I ask for investigation. After speaking, she presented two bowls of rice. When Xia was interrogated, she said that Yao has been spending the New Year at my house these two days. Every day, I cook the rice and put it in a bowl for him to eat. A moment ago, I cooked lunch and was about to bring it to him when he asked me to pour a cup of tea. When I turned around to pour the tea, I vaguely saw Yao take out a paper package from his arms and put something into his own rice bowl. When I turned back with the tea, he said that I wanted to harm him and put poison in the rice bowl. After taking the bowl of rice I was eating, he suddenly started arguing. He knew that he was intentionally framing me. I ask for clarification. It was observed that the rice that Yao ate was indeed yellow, which was very different from the color of Xia's bowl of rice. However, because there were no chemical equipment, it was difficult to determine whether it contained toxic substances, and the statements of both parties were conflicting, the case was very bizarre. It was ordered to prepare a document along with the two bowls of rice and submit it to the third section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat Robbed off Songkou</h3>
<p>Two Shot, One Kidnapped</p>
<p>The fishing boat Xu Yonghe, loaded with a large amount of iced fresh fish from Ningbo to Shanghai for sale, was sailing through the Hengsha waters off the Wusongkou at around 4 pm the day before yesterday when two bandit boats suddenly appeared, opening fire and ordering them to stop. When the boatmen saw this, they wanted to turn the rudder to avoid them, but two were shot by the bandits. At this point, all the crew had to stop. The two bandit boats then approached the fishing boat, boarded the boat with weapons, and robbed all the silver dollars. Before leaving, they also kidnapped one of the crew members, demanding a ransom within a time limit. After robbing and looting, the two bandit boats sailed towards the East China Sea. After the incident, the fishing boat could not sail because the rudder was damaged by the bandits. Yesterday, a neighboring boat passed by and saw it and tried to tow it to the outer beach, and sent the injured Zhang Ajin and Huang Fushun to the hospital for treatment first. They immediately came to Shanghai to report the incident to Shen.</p>
<h3>Zou Aizhen's Counter-Suit Against Tang Huixuan for Bigamy to be Heard Today</h3>

<h3>Qiu Youxin Withdraws Appeal to Supreme Court</h3>
<p>Qiu Zi Can Hope to be Pardoned</p>
<p>Qiu Youxin, a native of Yong, once served as an official and also lived in Sun Yue's shogunate. He also knew many important people in the current party-state. Last autumn, the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned that he was a disciple of Wang Jingwei, and under Wang's mission, he mobilized Shanghai merchants to form a group, which was close to being rebellious. He was referred to the Special District Court for arrest. After interrogation, he was allowed to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Qiu denied all the accusations, so he filed an appeal to the High Court, requesting the revocation of the first instance's ruling. After the High Court concluded its trial, it recognized that his appeal was unjustified and rejected it. Qiu was still dissatisfied and appealed to the Nanjing Supreme Court. Before the verdict, he was still temporarily detained in the police station and held for several months. On New Year's Day this year, the National Government granted amnesty to political prisoners. Qiu heard about it in prison, and thought that his crime should be included in the amnesty. Why should he appeal again, in vain? He asked Lawyer Jiang Baoli to file a statement to withdraw the appeal to the Supreme Court, and submitted it to the Special District Court of first instance yesterday morning, declaring that the appeal has been withdrawn, and he is willing to obey the ruling of the first instance and asked to execute it immediately. Judge Feng then instructed Qiu Youxin to be taken by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. If his crime is indeed worthy of amnesty, he will be released soon.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Works Bureau Improves Water Supply in Dexinli, Yinxiang District</h3>
<p>Dexinli in Yinxiang District of this city has been supplied with drinking water by the artesian well of the Zhenyi Silk Factory in the district.

Recently, he was arrested by the General Patrol Room and sent to the Special District Court for investigation and trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu opened the court and announced the verdict on Chen Dao's case. It was calculated that he committed six counts of armed robbery, each count was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights. According to the precedent, the combined execution of the term of imprisonment was eighteen years and deprivation of civil rights for eight years.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Robbery Victim Comes to Shanghai for Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Qingpu Sends Detectives to Shanghai to Arrest Him</p>
<p>The robber Zhang Zhengxin (alias Li Zhengxin), a native of Qingpu, used firearms to rob the property of Wang Wudong's family in Qingpu County on the 14th of this month. He fired shots on the spot, accidentally injuring himself in the process. He then fled to Shanghai, changed his name to Li Yousan, and sought treatment at the Shanghai Municipal Council's Sanatorium Hospital at 126靶子路. After Qingpu County Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jinghua learned that Zhang was seeking treatment in Shanghai, he sent Detective Captain Wang Shi備 to Shanghai a few days ago with an official document. They contacted the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate the hospital. They confirmed that Wang Yousan was indeed there. When questioned about the Qingpu case and the shooting, he confessed everything. However, the robber's injuries were quite serious, and he was unable to move. Detectives were assigned to guard him to prevent his escape. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer submitted a petition to the Criminal Division of the Special District Court, stating that Zhang Zhengxin was receiving treatment at the hospital and could not be brought to court today, and that it would be necessary to wait for his recovery before proceeding with the case. Subsequently, Qingpu County Public Security Bureau Detective Captain Wang Shi備 presented an official document, outlining the details. Judge Feng Shide then ordered that since Zhang Zhengxin had committed robbery and serious homicide in Qingpu County, he should be examined again after he recovers from his injuries at the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Robbers from Zhaojiadu</h3>
<p>The home of Wu Musheng at 52 Qianzong Lane, Zhaojiadu (Chinese territory) in western Shanghai, was robbed of property on the 15th of this month. After investigation by the Sixth District Detectives of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the robbers Bian Xishan and two others were apprehended. They confessed that their accomplices, Wang Jintao, Lu Haidao, and Chen Caigui, all natives of Pudong, were hiding at 74 Mengyuan Inn, Jiujiang Road, in the Public Concession. Subsequently, Inspector Xu Tao, together with detectives from the Laozha Police Station, went to the address a few days ago and arrested Wang and the others. Guo Zixiang and a woman, Lu Wangshi, who were suspected of being involved, were also brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the First Criminal Division of the Special District Court. According to the police lawyer's statement of the case, the crime occurred in the Chinese territory, and there was no objection to the transfer. Inspector Xu then presented an official document requesting the transfer. When questioned, Wang Xitao and the others confessed to the robbery, but claimed that Bian Xishan was the instigator. They also stated that Guo Zixiang and the others were not involved. After Judge Xu examined the confessions, he ordered that Wang Xitao, Lu Haidao, and Chen Caigui be handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to be taken back for further investigation. Guo Zixiang and Lu Wangshi, who were found to be uninvolved, were released in court.</p>
<h3>A Woman's Excuse of Borrowing Clothes</h3>
<p>to Watch a Play Leads to Her Disappearance</p>
<p>Zhou Shunzi, a seventeen-year-old woman from Yancheng living at 536 Junfu Lane, Chadaijiao, was quite pretty and worked in a yarn factory. She went to the factory to work the night shift at 5 PM the day before yesterday, but unexpectedly returned home. Her mother asked why she had come back, and she replied that Song Dongsheng's wife wanted to see a play and had asked to borrow a lined jacket from her, so she had returned home to get the clothes. Her mother advised her not to go to the play with them, but she casually agreed and left with the clothes. Unexpectedly, she did not return home the next morning. Zhou Susi suspected that her daughter had gone out with Song's wife, so she went to Song's boat at Longdukou (Song lived on a boat) to look for her, but neither Song nor his wife were to be found. At the same time, Shi Jinren, Song's wife's younger brother, who lived with Song, was also missing. Anxious, the mother went to the yarn factory to inquire and learned that her daughter had not gone to work. Workers at the factory informed her that her daughter and Shi Jinren had been in love for some time, and that Song Dongsheng had been acting as a matchmaker. The mother immediately reported the matter to the water patrol, who dispatched police to guard Song's boat. They waited but did not see Song or Shi. Later, Shi and Song returned to the boat together and were arrested by the police. They denied borrowing clothes or abducting the woman. Yesterday, the case was transferred to the District Court for interrogation and delivery.</p>
<h3>Four Suspects in Murder Case Transferred to Court</h3>
<p>Zhu Yinhe, from Taixian, Jiangbei, lived in Shenjiatan, Yangshupu. His wife, Zhu Jiangshi, had an affair with Shen Junying. In December of last year, Shen Junying and Sun Baoquan conspired to lure Zhu Yinhe out and kill him at Gaolang Bridge, abandoning his body in the wilderness. The District Court sent personnel to examine the body, but because no one claimed it, it was registered as an unidentified corpse and buried pending further investigation. Shen and the others then tried to cover up their crime by having Kong Lingwang write a fake letter to Zhu Jiangshi, purportedly from Zhu Yinhe, stating that he had joined the army in another place and should not be looked for. However, they could not keep the secret, and it was discovered. The Public Security Bureau Detective Squad, together with the Concession Police, arrested Shen Junying, Sun Baoquan, Kong Lingwang, Zhu Jiangshi, and others and brought them to the bureau. Yesterday, they prepared a document and transferred the four suspects to the District Court for interrogation. Prosecutor Yang conducted a preliminary hearing and ordered them to be detained separately pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Sun Zhongxian Meets Robbers on New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>Losing 1,000 Yuan to Avoid Further Harm</p>
<p>Sun Zhongxian, the owner of the Huizhong Inn in the Concession, took his own car at around 7 PM on the 16th (the day before yesterday) to the savings department of the Wing On Company on the Avenue Edward VII to withdraw 3,000 yuan in banknotes. He divided the money into three packets of 1,000 yuan each and carried them out. Since Avenue Edward VII did not allow empty cars to park, the driver drove the car to Tianjin Road to wait for Sun to walk to the corner of Tianjin Road at the Sincere Company's insurance department. Since it was the last day of the old lunar year, the road was crowded with pedestrians. As Sun was about to turn onto Tianjin Road, two robbers suddenly appeared. One of the robbers, wearing a Western suit, pulled out a pistol and pointed it at Sun's chest, signaling him to hand over the money. Sun, realizing that he had encountered robbers, immediately handed over one packet of banknotes, worth 1,000 yuan. The robbers grabbed the money, checked it, and fled north. After the robbers had gone some distance, Sun took the car to the police station to report the incident and request an investigation.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Industry in 1919</h3>
<p>(Continued from Yesterday) (Xinchen)</p>
<p>(2) The Cotton Market Dominated by the Gold Market</p>
<p>Cotton market conditions should be proportionally advanced or delayed with the yarn market. However, this year, due to the small amount of domestic inventory and the poor production of new cotton, coupled with the sharp rise in gold prices, although foreign cotton prices repeatedly hit new lows, their impact was more moderate than that of the yarn market. In the past year, the pressure from foreign cotton has always shown a sluggish situation. In January, it was driven by the soaring gold prices and the shrinking exchange rates, reaching 36 taels, 5 qian and 5 fen. In early February, the sudden drop of more than 100 points in American cotton caused the cotton market, which had just stabilized, to collapse again. However, due to the scarcity of imported goods and the strong attitude of those holding the goods, it hovered between 34 and 5 taels. In late February, although American cotton saw a renewed decline, it did not rise or fall with it.</p>
<p>However, Indian cotton was sold at low prices, and factories ordered as much as 130,000 to 140,000 bales, which was a hidden worry for the cotton market itself. In March, American cotton saw its lowest price since 1926. The world cotton market did not follow the downward trend. Factory orders were also sluggish, and the market was weak. However, the Hanbang attitude was calm, and the market trend turned flat. In early April, it still tended towards a weak path. Subsequently, American cotton was strongly pulled up by cooperatives for May-July futures, and the prices rebounded. Local inventory was low, and buying nitrogen recovered, hovering around 36 taels. However, spot sales were particularly quiet. In early May, there were no changes in demand, and the situation was erratic. Generally, the American cotton that people paid attention to rose and fell uncertainly, and the new and old cotton differed, and it seemed to lose its leadership. As for demand, Indian cotton had been largely absorbed, and there was little development. However, due to the small inventory and disk, by the end of the month, the exchange market reversed, creating an unprecedented record, and those in need became active again, which stimulated a strong upward trend. In early June, gold prices soared, and the upward trend continued, reaching 37 taels and 4 qian. At this time, the cotton market had lost its inherent ability, and it only followed the lead of the exchange rate. Subsequently, there was a prediction that American cotton inventories would reach 6 million bales, and the market sentiment greatly declined. Indian cotton was sold out, and inventories were high, resulting in a major collapse. In one day, it fell sharply by 32 rupees, causing great panic. It was the opposite of the trend at the beginning of the month. Fortunately, the inventory was not abundant, so it did not become very sluggish. In July, the market situation was weak again. American cotton was performing well with the new cotton, and sales were greatly reduced, so the market trend was sluggish. Indian cotton was also soft. Manufacturers had abundant inventories and continued to receive orders, so their attitude was extremely cowardly. However, speculative manipulation of futures cotton did not follow the advances and retreats of foreign cotton, resulting in a squeeze. In early August, due to the cotton market in Shashi, and the US telegram reported that the drought situation had stabilized, the first American cotton estimate was released at 14.36 million bales, falling more than 200 points per pound and reaching 1 dime and 1 cent. There were few inquiries for spot goods, and buyers painfully cut their losses. The price of standard cotton fell sharply by more than 2 taels. At the end of the month, the cotton prices prepared for delivery were sufficient, falling to 31 taels and 9 qian. In September, American cotton continued to fall, Indian cotton was newly sold, and the market trend was weak. However, due to the successive autumn rains, the new cotton suffered considerable losses, and the market trend turned firm and stable again. Later, the yarn market was active, and factory orders had a degree of demand, and the market trend continued to be firm. However, American cotton was like a river going downhill, and Indian cotton was sold at a reduced price. Trade was very strong, and the market trend was under pressure again. However, the yarn market was firm and presented a stable situation. In early October, the market situation was still weak. The American cotton government's estimate was released, breaking through the 1 dime mark. Manufacturers were eager to get Indian cotton at this time when new cotton was on the market, but the needs were weak, which was even worse than the era of　flower. In addition, the yarn market was weak, making the cotton market more and more dangerous. A strong downward trend suddenly arose, and various 　standard cotton prices broke through the 1 tael mark. In late October, there were reports of frost damage to American cotton, and the cooperative absorbed spot goods again, and the prices suddenly rose again, and the new cotton was less on the market, and the market trend turned upward again. The trend in November was more moderate, which was mainly driven by the soft harvest of new domestic cotton. The harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang was indeed poor, and the situation in Hubei and Henan was slightly better, but banditry was rampant, and transportation was inconvenient, resulting in a small amount on the market. In addition, the difference between gold and silver prices was even greater, so American and Indian cotton's lack of sales and weak actual sales were not greatly affected. 　In early December, the market situation was very weak. American cotton spot prices had fallen below the 1 dime mark, and the silk market had fallen like a thousand miles. Factory orders were stagnant, exports were also depressed, and the market sentiment was very weak. Subsequently, American cotton and the yarn market reported rebounds, and gold rose sharply. With little inventory and a shortage of arrivals, a fierce squeeze occurred. This month, the market saw 35 taels at the end of the year. The following is a list of spot and futures prices and transactions.</p>

<p>(3) The Rise and Fall of Foreign Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, English cotton followed the trend of the previous year and reached its highest peak this year. Subsequently, sales declined sharply and became more and more sluggish. In March, it fell to 1 dime and 4 fen.</p>
<p>The world's American cotton sales remained sluggish, and compared to the first half of the year, they were　extremely　visible. However, due to the cooperative's absorption of May to July futures, the market situation was pulled up for a five　seeing 1 dime and 6 fen and 7 li. However, the actual　situation remained empty. The name national cotton industry's slump reported　　transmitted, and the carryover number at the end of the season will increase sharply, and the news of the smooth progress of the new cotton will be heard from time to time, proving　consistent with　the market conditions of low and low　　. Therefore, the cooperative's manipulation suffered a major blow, and the market situation declined month by month. By the end of the year, the spot price had broken through the 1 dime mark, seeing 9 fen and 4 li and 5, the new low since 9 fen and 2 li during the European War in 1916. Liverpool's American cotton also rose and fell with the New York market, and Indian cotton fell even more sharply than American cotton. Recently, revolutionary trends have emerged in India, the political situation is unstable, and there are many middle-class workers in cotton mills. New cotton production is also good. 勃洛去 was 309 rupees in January, and it was 170 rupees at the end of the year. Indian cotton in the Chinese market　The situation of　seeking prices is obvious. Three-grade American cotton also advances and retreats with American cotton and yarn. The decline of three-grade yarn is also particularly fierce. To China with (1) Exchange is not cost-effective (2) The situation in mainland China is unstable, exports are sluggish, and yarn　There are continued increases, although　　reduction of work, the report of the increase in yarn market inventory every month. In March, India　increased the preferential tariff, and Japanese products were also severely　hit. The difficult situation is even more severe. On June 24, it fell to 98 yuan and 5 jiao, which is the lowest price since 1915. Compared with the peak of 183 yuan and 6 jiao in January,　and its half rebounded immediately. However, it still hovers between 130 yuan and 140 yuan. In short, the yarn market in 1919, China was　smooth, and the world's　forms were also the same, and even more so than China. This is absolutely due to the smoothness of the international economic situation, and the trend of 1920　depends on　the smoothness of the　scene. The situation advances and retreats. The following is a list of the main flower and yarn market conditions in the world.</p>
<p>(2) Comparison of Flower and Yarn Prices in the Last Two Years</p>
<p>The world's flower and yarn market in 1919 was weak, as mentioned above, and its trend, except for the three-grade yarn in the middle of the explosion and the slight rebound, were all　from the beginning of the year into a straight line of decline, compared with the situation in 1918, except for the slightly flat middle cotton, there were huge differences. The following is a comparison of the prices of Chinese and foreign flowers and yarn in the past two years.</p>

<h3>Tung Oil Market Before Account Settlement</h3>
<p>Since the National Government implemented the Gregorian calendar, commercial settlements have been difficult, and therefore postponed to mid-February, and various businesses have also been suspended. The export market for white tung oil has nothing to do with settlement, but because Hankou merchants must sort things out at the end of the period, trading is inevitably affected by the market closure. At the beginning, foreign firms stationed in Hankou still handled 200 to 300 tons, and the price fell from 21.56 taels to 20.08 taels per standard foreign measurement. The reason for the decline in the market is probably that sellers are affected by the settlement. There is a difference between selling and not selling at this price. Domestic sales were originally within the prosperous period. It is said that the Hankou market closed at 19 taels per standard foreign measurement. Various firms in this port have long relied on Zhejiang tung oil for domestic sales in recent years, using Hankou tung oil as a reference for the market. It seems to have little practical relationship, which is also a change in the market. The closing price of Zhejiang tung oil seems to be around 29 yuan per picul. Some may not be willing to sell even if delivered to Shanghai. This is just a matter of individual preference. The amount of inventory brought in by various firms was also small, probably due to the approaching settlement period, which required a shift based on the tightness of funds. The thickness of inventory varied among firms, with some having four to five thousand piculs, and others only several hundred piculs. The total market stock of Hongjiang tung oil is about seven or eight thousand barrels, including cargo held by agents. The market situation is stable. The stock of Xiushan tung oil is extremely low, with a total market stock of over one thousand barrels. It is expected that the market will inevitably increase prices when it opens. For several days during the closure, everyone was busy with the settlement. There were no reports of profit or loss, but based on superficial observation, the autumn season was the most severely affected in terms of annual business results, making it difficult to make a profit.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: All Silk Factories in Shanghai Suspended Operations</h3>
<p>Due to the slight increase in European sales of factory silk and the rise in silk prices, various silk factories in this port have borrowed money to start work in order to meet market demand. Unexpectedly, the improvement was short-lived, lasting less than ten days before it became sluggish. Silk prices have fallen by more than a hundred taels, while the price of dry cocoons remains high, making the cost of silk still heavy. There are very few orders from overseas. Manufacturers have difficulty selling at a loss. The operating expenses of the factories are large, and the issuance of government relief bonds still takes time. Unable to sustain, more than a dozen silk factories that had already started work, such as Ruilun, all suspended operations on the 14th, and will resume work after the government bonds are issued.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Woolens: New Goods Continue to be Imported</h3>
<p>Many are transshipped to Dalian</p>
<p>Since February 1st, woolens have continued to be imported, with a total number of over two thousand pieces. Among them are lightweight goods for spring sales, such as "straight line" woolens, serge, patterned woolens, and "Walter" woolens. There are also many patterned fabrics and raincoat fabrics, all of which have been unloaded from the docks. Among them, many are being transshipped to Dalian. According to regulations, goods shipped to Dalian after April 1st will no longer be eligible for tax refunds, so businesses are transporting them in advance.</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's European War Diary</h3>
<p>Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>I immediately rushed to Gachelons and arrived at my headquarters at 7:00 PM. I organized a staff and immediately asked General Hanbote, commander of the mixed army corps, to command the Ninth Army. Since the outbreak of the war, the youngest officers have been the calmest, most discerning, most persevering, and most decisive. I resolved a series of important matters with him. I reluctantly said goodbye to Mr. Xiepolong, the magistrate of Laon, and set off at 10:00 PM for [unknown place]. The rest of my staff set off a few days later. Riding motorcycles, we traveled through the long night. The roads were rough and uneven, having been destroyed by artillery fire. The bridges over the rivers had only been hastily repaired. The villages everywhere were in ruins.</p>
<p>Our journey first passed through the battlefield of the Marne River, then through Montmirail and Meaux. After crossing the river, we encountered the battlefield of Walk, then through Saint-Lizier and Soissons. We crossed the Vesle River, passed through Crouy-Saint-Pierre and Soissons, and finally arrived at Blercourt at 5:30 AM on October 5th.</p>
<p>I immediately notified General Gasteaud that I had found him. While waiting for him, I rested on a bench in a school. He came in shortly after. From then on, I took over the responsibility of commanding the battle on the northern front.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Flanders</h3>
<p>After the Battle of the Marne (previously translated as the Battle of the Marne River) came the second phase of the European War, called "The Race to the Sea." This name seems pleasant, but it does not truly express the intent of the battle, nor does it truly reflect the underlying plan. This war was indeed a race to the enemy. We hoped to encircle the enemy's right flank, and we also avoided being encircled by the enemy. Because the enemy wanted to quickly encircle us, their strategy coincided with ours. Therefore, both sides raced towards the northern wing.</p>
<p>At the same time, we had to stop the enemy's advance, preventing them from moving in other theaters of war. This battle line gradually lengthened. Therefore, as a result of the same strategy, the development of the northern wing passed through Ypres, Flanders, Picardy, Artois, and Flanders, all the way to the North Sea, very quickly. In this way, although the North Sea was not the original objective, it became the end point of the two armies' strategies.</p>
<p>The two armies repeatedly came into contact with each other along the line, without any resolution. Finally, advancing to the North Sea became impossible. The Battle of Ypres then occurred. In this battle, both sides wanted to use all their strength to quickly break through the temporary defenses in order to achieve a resolution.</p>
<p>After a full month of racing, the Allied forces had defeated the enemy's offensive on the Marne River, and now they were stopping the enemy's advance on the banks of the Yser River, and saving the various commercial ports of the Channel. The Allied position was thus consolidated, and the unity of Britain and France was strengthened. If they could not defeat the German army in a decisive battle, they could at least make it impossible for the enemy to use any tricks or find any openings.</p>
<p>A major war, especially one involving several allied nations, and even containing several fierce battles, cannot be viewed from the perspective of the individual armies involved. A major war is a totality made up of many interconnected battles. Although it spans a long time and a large space, it must be coordinated from beginning to end in order to achieve the final, good result.</p>
<p>If one side stalls, or if one army in particular experiences defeat, the commander-in-chief must resolutely maintain his overall plan, while encouraging and supporting the weakened corner. He must never admit defeat of the overall situation, or abandon or change the plan because of its weakness. Even if an army is severely damaged at a certain time, it must never disturb the common actions of the other armies, or affect the war situation that protects the interests of the entire Allied forces.</p>

<p>Youth Corner</p>
<h3>Hope</h3>
<p>Tang Gai</p>
<p>In our youth, we especially need the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Whenever the school recruits students, or when the semester is about to begin, whenever someone meets someone else, or meets Old Secretary Cao, they always ask:</p>
<p>"Are there any girls in our class?"</p>
<p>This important question is something that everyone wants to have explained clearly by Secretary Cao before the start of classes.</p>
<p>If there are girls in the class, they will walk with three steps at a time, jumping up, as if a soldier had won a victory on the battlefield, their eyes wide open, looking proudly at the classmates who had returned defeated after inquiring about whether there were girls in the class.</p>
<p>In the past, at the beginning of each semester, sooner or later, one could always see a few ladies gracefully dispersing to the various classes to attend classes. The classmates who did not have ladies in their classes could only droop their heads, harboring evil thoughts, pacing back and forth a few times in front of the classroom doors of classes that had girls.</p>
<p>Although my words may seem a bit excessive, we cannot deceive each other.</p>
<p>At first, everyone was very eager for ladies to grace the class with their presence, but after there were ladies, they felt constrained and bored.</p>
<p>No one knew that these ladies in leather shoes and cheongsams were modern on the outside but not modern on the inside.</p>
<p>Sitting in class, they would not move at all. When the teacher asked a question, they would speak shyly and softly, always blushing their tender white faces. When class meetings were held, it was rare for them to attend. If they were happy to participate, they would be silent. Only when they ran back to the dormitory after class could we hear their voices downstairs.</p>
<p>Apart from going to class, they were never seen running around on campus, building a highland wall between us at some point.</p>
<p>We were originally uninhibited, talking freely about sexual matters as soon as class was over, putting our feet up high and talking in great detail. But since they came, it felt as if there was an invisible teacher supervising us, and we dared not say anything at all.</p>
<p>We only regretted the teacher. Several of our naughty classmates, with mouths like county rivers, racked our brains to think of many difficult questions to stump the teacher and make the ladies laugh, hoping that our shadows would enter the hearts of the ladies. It was pitiful that sometimes the teacher would shout loudly with a red face, "Stop making noise!" Sometimes they would remain silent with pale lips.</p>
<p>Now the semester has started again. Today I went to class and saw a new lady I did not recognize sitting in the corner, listening to the lecture silently, her face full of white powder, with two jet-black eyebrows drawn on. We all moved our mouths at each other, smiling for a while, indicating that an angel had descended and a new life had begun. However, whether it will be the same as before, isolating us, God!</p>
<h3>Dinner Gathering</h3>
<p>"In order to promote friendship among members, the society has decided through a meeting of officers to hold a dinner gathering at [blank] Western Restaurant on [blank] day of [blank] month. We hope that members of the society will actively participate and contribute to the grand occasion.</p>
<p>Guangming Society of Hanzheng College [blank] month [blank] day." This was a notice from an academic organization that we had formed to encourage learning. One morning, as soon as I stepped into the school gate, I saw it head-on. After reading it carefully, a feeling of inexplicable joy suddenly arose in my heart. The scene of the dinner gathering seemed to be reflected in front of my eyes, as if I had already pounced on it. I stood there for a while, and then I saw our executive committee member Han also coming with a lecture folder. We greeted each other politely. Then he took out the signing book for the dinner gathering and said gently:</p>
<p>"Please sign up for the dinner gathering."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Thus, on the quantity of two yuan, it was decided that I was also a participating member.</p>
<p>The next day at noon, Li and I had lunch in a restaurant opposite the school. It happened that Yu was also there. We talked about the smooth progress of the dinner gathering, because in the past few days everyone had been looking forward to the arrival of the dinner gathering. Yu was also a member in charge, so he was able to know the inside situation.</p>
<p>"Are there many people participating?"</p>
<p>"There are many, you won't be disappointed."</p>
<p>"Are there any female classmates?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I can't guarantee how many, probably about five."</p>
<p>Unintentionally, laughter scattered a long stay among us.</p>
<p>The day we had been looking forward to arrived. I made an appointment with Jian to go together, but waiting until 5:30, when the dark color gradually enveloped us, he still did not appear. I decided to go alone. On the road, peacefully,</p>
<p>·········I stepped into that huge building.</p>
<p>A white-clothed messenger led me inside. Then Jin, Jian, Yu, Li, Bai, Han··········were already there. There were also many others I did not know. After exchanging greetings, I began to pay attention to the expressions on everyone's faces, which were rosy and joyful, prominently displayed. In addition, the lake-colored lights shone evenly, further imbuing a poetic mood. I seemed to fully expand my smiling face with satisfaction. This group of proud children flourishing in youth!</p>
<p>However, when I paid attention to the gender division, I could not help but feel a slight sense of disappointment. "There is no integration of the two sexes tonight." In fact, the thick taste is reduced, and I also suspect, is it because the female classmates are afraid? If so, then why bother with this group life? Or, is there another reason?</p>
<p>Just as I was having those thoughts, I finally discovered Ms. Fan, a female figure, among the heroes.</p>
<p>Thus, the intensity of joy seemed to be revived.</p>
<p>Jian had called back to the school to invite Ms. Guo and the others, but the result was in vain. In this way, everyone expressed even more admiration for Ms. Fan's only coming.</p>
<p>Ms. Fan firmly declined in the voices of praise from the crowd, nodding and accepting.</p>
<p>After several urgings, [blank]'s face already showed a difficult expression. We decided not to wait for anyone and started our work.</p>
<p>Originally, the dinner gathering was an expression of seeking pleasure, as [blank] said, "A dinner gathering is more interesting than any meal. You are taking your own money, you can have no restraint." The so-called wolfing down food, joking and making fun are all necessary ingredients. What scruples are there? At the same time, only in this way can you truly have a hearty revelry.</p>
<p>We spread a white cloth on our chests and tightly held the silver hand with both hands. Grape wine, brandy, full pours, cheers, then pour again······</p>
<p>Han [blank] Chairman reported the significance of the dinner gathering, came, he asked everyone to express an opinion.</p>
<p>Jian opened the court, the second round arrived at [blank], he expressed opposition, the reason is this,</p>
<p>"Tonight is a dinner gathering, we do not need a meeting to pretend to be here, I object to the Chairman's opinion, I hope the Chairman will immediately withdraw his order······"</p>
<p>Passed without objection,</p>
<p>The topic then turned to another direction, Bai suggested everyone</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>report an erotic history, the result of the people divided into three parts married, have the object, no object, after inspection,</p>
<p>married account for a quarter, then married into a wall, to the unmarried implementation of the attack,</p>
<p>"We are married, simply also the age of youth passed, no need to report, you unmarried but should report, if you find a failure in your progress steps, we should fulfill the responsibility of guidance," Zheng said selfishly and seemingly well-intentioned,</p>
<p>Naturally, on his side, failed to agree, arguing went through a long period of time,</p>
<p>"Now, we want Yu to love to report," Bai in the debate, another path,</p>
<p>Everyone agreed, but Yu only know, he is not willing to report in public, although his heart is not known how,</p>
<p>"Then, I will report on behalf of Bai self-proclaimed courageous"</p>
<p>ground,</p>
<p>So, Bai very cleverly said a great chapter, of course, the listener is laugh unrecoverable,</p>
<p>One by one asked in the past, in the questioner are inevitably fly on the red cloud, Zheng is even more talkative, he asked a general unmarried, this is Ms. Fan,</p>
<p>"Do you have an object,"</p>
<p>"No" Ms. Fan in the serious question, very natural answer,</p>
<p>"Why not,"</p>
<p>"Because not seek,"</p>
<p>"Why not seek,"</p>
<p>"Do not need,"</p>
<p>"Why do not need,"</p>
<p>"···············"</p>
<p>Here, we will only see Ms. Fan's laughter,</p>
<p>···············</p>
<p>Weary look in the confession of each other's growth, it seems that they have been satisfied with the harvest, we all unanimously turned to the title of Yan Shi, but could not bear such a quick departure, rare pouring, how can we relax this opportunity,</p>
<p>Yu's spirit seems very excited, he dry a lot of cups, perhaps a certain impression led him to a smile of victory,</p>
<p>"Jian, when will Yu invite you to eat hooves,"</p>
<p>"···········" Jian smile and not answer, but look back at Yu,</p>
<p>········· time is very fast,</p>
<p>In order to prevent excessive delay, we finally tidy up and return,</p>
<p>In the "goodbye" sound, Zheng and I walk out, this is the snow weather, cold wind bone, cold people, the sky is gray and micro blue, I dry a cup more, slightly feel, on the road, we fun to do a round of the work of inspection, because it is along the way, we walk, inadvertently did such an unintentional move,</p>
<p>We squeezed in the bustling crowd, back, I also put a chapter told Jun, apparently I like a little pleasure like,</p>
<p>"Dinner is indeed tasty, but the female students are not as much as we expected,"</p>
<h3>New Teacher</h3>
<p>Yu</p>
<p>Before the class bell rang, we had already entered the second elective class classroom, eagerly waiting for the arrival of this new teacher who teaches political science introduction.</p>
<p>At first, we all seemed to think in our hearts that this new teacher was a very young, or a middle-aged male teacher with a full political atmosphere, because the word "politics" had to make us aware of this above, later, in the mouth of the director of education to know that this is a female teacher of the same sex, surnamed Ke, so, we are going to guess what kind of person she is,</p>
<p>"I think, she must be a little masculine,"</p>
<p>"I think, she must be very eloquent, and will say a very beautiful and fluent Mandarin,"</p>
<p>"I think, she must not be a vulgar woman"</p>
<p>"In short, I think, her knowledge, her behavior,</p>
<p>Everything about her is good, or, she may be the typical representative of modern women may not know, because I have heard that she is very good,"</p>
<p>This new teacher 丨 a new teacher we do not know, has been in our wanton chat as if affirmed, we are very satisfied waiting for class bells to send us this imaginary teacher in,</p>
<p>The class bell rang, a burst of leather shoes squeaking from the stairs, our new teacher was finally sent to the classroom door by the director of education, however, a head of hair oil coated very bright [unknown] neck long hair, a face coated with rouge and white powder framed a pair of black-rimmed glasses 丨 is about flat light, a black soft satin robe, inlaid with black leather, neckline with two very bright big red water diamond buttons, the robe is very tight, about too frugal fabric, the chest and arm are very clearly convex, feet under a pair of very high heels of black velvet boots, ah, this one, this one we desperately new teacher is walking into the classroom, she first gave eyebrow charcoal painted very long eyebrow frown a frown, and then micro-knowingly to us point a cunning head,</p>
<p>We handed in the elective card, although each printed with the same words except each person's name, but she still carefully each see a again, enough to spend more than five minutes of time, she just opened 丨 the voice is very light very light, the classroom is so quiet that even the sound of snot has no time, to make the students sitting in the back to hear, about she knows her voice is light, afraid we can not hear clearly, so she always a sentence to say three or four times, she said, "I am very happy to see you students today, I am just graduated from the university, so to speak of learning and experience is really some also no, now you can discuss each other with the students mutually cut, so I am also very happy", she finished the previous sentence to wait a while before the next sentence can be said, so these words she said a full quarter of an hour,</p>
<p>After, she told us what book to use, asked us to be sure to bring in the next hour, finally she said, "Now let's talk about it,"</p>
<p>A student asked, "What parties are divided in the United States now,"</p>
<p>"Divide two parties",</p>
<p>"That two",</p>
<p>"Divide two parties",</p>
<p>Asked again and again, she just replied this way,</p>
<p>"That now the U.S. President Hoover is that party," she also red and white powder face but also wiped some rouge,</p>
<p>"Republican," a quick-mouthed student grabbed the words out,</p>
<p>She put a thankful look to this quick-mouthed student glance at said, "Yes,"</p>
<p>About she is afraid that we will ask down again, it is very quickly to say, "I met with the students for the first time today,"</p>
<p>, I think students must not know me, I come to introduce myself, "she said she lived in the north for more than ten years, the year before last to Shanghai to enter the college of arts, this in this summer vacation graduation, for credit has been full, so in this winter vacation graduation, after that said a lot of what no knowledge no experience of the words, while saying while constantly stretched into the bag to touch a white pocket watch to see, about is afraid that time passes too fast, her words to be too late to say,</p>
<p>Sure enough, this new teacher is really a teacher with full learning in our imagination, she told us, "She read how thick how thick a what book in the first year of college, the second year the third year ····· read how thick how thick a book 丨 book name is said a very long very long foreign name, we can not understand, the thickness of the book is she put the two fingers to show us to see, really, how can not make people admire, she read each book has "English-Chinese word" as thick,</p>
<p>About she is afraid that we sit too long for the body is not suitable, so although the end of the bell has not rang, she said, "Today is the first hour, we will dismiss earlier,"</p>
<p>This well-learned new teacher finally floated away from us and down the stairs, only her pink and white face is still rocking in our minds,</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Subsidizes Poor Students</h3>
<p>Hua</p>
<p>Jiaotong University, in view of the fact that our country is now full of bandits and economic panic, and that even middle-class families are showing signs of recession, it is particularly difficult to bear the burden of providing students with a university education and paying tuition fees of three or four hundred yuan per year. Therefore, there are often those who drop out halfway due to family financial difficulties. In particular, the work-study system for students implemented by various universities in the United States is used, so that students can serve the school for two or three hours in their spare time and receive corresponding remuneration to maintain their studies. The work is divided into several types, which are described below,</p>
<p>(1) Translation Students Chinese and English level is profound, can take this work, will be all new magazines and books in the library, there are scientific new inventions, or explain the truth, or scientific news, news scale claws and other interesting literature, submit to the secretary for approval, after the secretary approved its translation, with timeless text, for detailed translation, translation and published in the school research institute published magazines, newspapers for domestic readers to read, the remuneration of about 5 yuan to 10 yuan per thousand words,</p>
<p>(2) Copying The school intends to reduce the size of the archives department in the future, and all copied documents and lectures will be undertaken by students. Students with beautiful handwriting will be selected to do so. However, for the sake of convenience, students must register in advance and state how many words they can handle per month, so as not to delay the text. The remuneration for this item is five corners per thousand words,</p>
<p>(3) Library The library needs more people,</p>
<p>All books are cataloged, books are classified, and borrowing and returning books, procedures are very cumbersome, so now plans to recruit ten members,</p>
<p>Each person is in charge of two hours per month, regardless of when, not limited to two consecutive hours or not, always to meet two hours as a degree, each person monthly salary of 20 yuan,</p>
<p>(4) Copy the blackboard The school in order to save the professor time, increase the professor efficiency, specially made so that students copy the blackboard method, in each class break ten minutes, the professor will need to copy the notes during class, to the copy blackboard students, copy on the blackboard, the professor lecturing, you can no longer spend time copying, and copy the blackboard students, can get remuneration by this, each person copy six hours a day, monthly can get ten yuan, the poor family, get this is not without small make up Yan,</p>
<p>A total of four methods, about can subsidize poor students more than a hundred students of the work-study, and can be seen in the difficulty of making a living, and strive to engage in academic studies Yan,</p>
<h3>Increase in Jiaoda's Basketball Stars</h3>
<p>Hua</p>
<p>Jiaoda's basketball team has always been famous. They once defeated the St. John's University basketball team, which represented China at the Far Eastern Games, and dominated the basketball scene in East China universities. Therefore, the team captain, Mr. Shen Guoquan, was nicknamed "Nanyang Jun". Now, Mr. Shen Guoquan has returned from the United States with even more profound knowledge of sports. The school president has hired him as the director of physical education. Mr. Shen, based on his past spirit, is determined to restore the school's reputation. Therefore, last year, he started the organization of the Nanyang Basketball Association so that various teams from the school could freely join the competition to select real talent and encourage practice. Mr. Shen himself also formed an "Old Team" with several faculty members to join. His spirit of promotion is like this. More than thirty-two teams joined. As a result, the Nannan Team won the championship. The Nannan Team is composed of freshmen from Nankai University and other students. The team name implies "From Nankai to Nanyang." The team has quite a few talented players, all of whom are brothers of the "Five Tigers" and were members of the Nankai inter-school team. The most famous is Zhou Longzhang, who is tall and robust. When shooting, he directly places the ball in the basket without missing. His speed and steady passing all resemble the "Five Tigers". The next is Mr. Ding Yuanhao, who is also tall and robust, and extremely agile, moving unpredictably, making him a top choice for center. The next is Mr. Jin Longxiang, who possesses the courage to fight for the ball fearlessly, having the imposing manner of "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand cannot enter", a natural inner guard. Others like Wu Liang and Chi Ming are all former students, and their skills are also very refined. Therefore, this basketball team composed of these players is invincible, defeating anyone who encounters them. Even the school's inter-school representative team from last year was defeated twice. It is a pity that due to their freshman status, they cannot participate in this year's Jiangda competition; otherwise, Jiaoda would have a great chance of winning the championship.</p>
