<h3>日輪撞壞招商廣大輪</h3>
<p>損失六千金過在日本船</p>
<p>現在交涉出海安全問題</p>
<p>日商出下汽船會社銀出丸輪運煤來滬至招商局金利源碼頭交卸其船主因玩忽職務而將招商局廣大輪與第三號碼頭撞壞損失頗巨茲爲廣大出海安全問題已向日方交涉而日人諉推延宕亟將此事始末分記如後</p>
<p>肇禍責在日船出下銀山丸輪所裝之煤起卸於招商局在一月三十一日上午十一時十八分該日輪駛至金利源碼頭時招商局早已留出第三號碼頭以該輪停泊碼頭管理員特留出三零五英尺地位以供二六零尺之日船停泊則綽乎有餘詎該輪將近碼頭時仍開快車向三號碼頭逕行駛來而二號碼頭正停泊南華班輪廣大號裝運出口貨物瞥見銀山九之急進乃大驚時碼頭管理員與廣大船員大聲呌喊令日輪火速停車並令急打倒車以免相撞不料銀山丸船主至是已驚若木鷄而不知所措轟然一聲逐肇此相撞之巨禍</p>
<p>船與碼頭均損廣大船停靠碼頭無法讓避見制止日船無效恐被猛撞發生大禍乃急抛兩條錨鍊在外擋以資阻擋不意日輪來勢至急銀山丸先將廣大巨鍊打斷一根繼則其船又向廣大之後船尾撞來當被撞破後艙外舵之鐵板兩方裂成四英尺以外之大洞一個幸在水綫之上艙中未會侵水而銀山丸於撞廣大後復將三號碼頭之梅花椿一根撞斷來勢之猛可以想見日輪船頭亦因反繳力而捐壞其旗桿一根並遭折斷出事以後方始靠停三號碼頭以三百餘尺之地而二百六十尺船猶肇此禍其責任全在日船主之玩忽職務也</p>
<p>雙方派員騐船出事後招商派騐船師張某山下派武川四郎同到金利源碼頭檢騐結果除廣大被撞之破洞等修理約五千金又梅花椿一根捐失約六七百元由山下承認賠償外據招商局騐船師言廣大輪被撞至重照例進塢騐看内部其舵車葉子與後艙之水櫃等有無捐壞刻因貨物裝足不可明瞭若開至中途發生危險則關係全船生命財産而日騐船師堅稱廣大捐失在水綫以上可無其他危險不必入塢可以照常開行</p>
<p>出海安全問題昨午山下代表到招商局交涉此事堅不認廣大之内部有捐招商局即行具函山下汽社大致謂照貴社騐船師謂捐在水綫之上船可開行萬一出海以後發生危險則關係重大非可兒戲如貴社能担負廣大輪之出海安全請即復函證明（表示負責則廣大可免入塢再事檢騐否則爲愼重航行計惟有將貨件卸出重加勘查一切停班等捐失亦須貴社負責認償現俟其復信到來後再行定奪開放與否</p>

<h3>那個女孩</h3>
<p>— 語溪</p>
<p>遊藝會中</p>
<p>那天遊藝會参加表演的有兩個小孩子是最使人注意的</p>
<p>一個是「八個好學生」中作敎練的那男孩子他戴着紙糊的大禮帽西裝馬袴大皮鞋腮畫八字鬚手執司底克指手劃脚地對衆演說口齒響亮而且流利態度莊嚴而帶滑稽是一個頗可造就的表演的天才</p>
<p>第二個乃是扮「小鸚哥」的女孩子小小的身段穿着綠色的舞衣被燙過了的頭髮給一根水鑽的髮箍緊緊地束住下面露着一張怪可愛的玫瑰臉宛如意話書上所畫着的小仙子的樣子</p>
<p>據她們的校長葛小姐說他們兩人是兄妹</p>
<p>有着這些孩子的父母眞是値得驕人的了我想</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>那女孩子表演過之後仍躲在旁邊看她並不進後台去烘火這樣冷的天氣　我看她她臉上露着天真的徽笑我問她「你穿這薄薄的衣裳不冷麽」</p>
<p>「不冷」她說「等一回我還要表演</p>
<p>呢」</p>
<p>「啊凍壞了你媽媽要駡」我故意這樣說「我們烘火爐去好不」我携着她的手走進化裝室蹲在爐旁烘火她是絲毫没有怕陌生人的様子</p>
<p>我問了她許多問題她答姓兪十二歳她哥哥大她兩歳於是我又問「那個就是你的哥哥麽」</p>
<p>「是的我有兩個哥哥呢還有一個在中學讀書」</p>
<p>她們的校長葛小姐進來了校長對於那孩子怕是母親於女兒一様地愛着呢是的從那孩子身上她是取得了不少的光榮了誰不說這孩子是他們敎得這樣乖的呢</p>
<p>校長用着母親的口吻命令她的學生說「囡囡呌聲張先生」</p>
<p>「張先生」孩子是很聽話的</p>

<h3>Yu Youren Assumes Office as President of the Control Yuan</h3>
<p>Central Representative Zhang Ji Delivers Instructive Address</p>
<p>Nanjing - Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, held a swearing-in ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, following the memorial week for the Premier of the National Government. Attendees included Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Peide, Zhang Ji, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaozu, Zhang Huichang, Liu Shangqing, Lin Xiang, Wei Daoming, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Bulei, Li Shuhua, Li Jinxi, Zhang Wohua, representatives from various institutions, National Government staff, and over two hundred others. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek paid his respects, he first presented the seal. Chiang presented the seal to Yu Youren, who accepted it. Next was the swearing-in ceremony, presided over by Central Committee member Zhang Ji. Yu raised his right hand and took the oath. After the oath, the presiding official, Zhang Ji, delivered an instructive address, stating briefly that Premier's Five-Power Constitution stipulated five Yuan, and four Yuan had been established successively. Only the Control Yuan was missing. Comrade Yu's assumption of office today completes the Five-Power system. The executive, legislative, and judicial powers are common to all countries in the world, but the examination and control powers are the great creations of our unified political philosophy and also the essence of our country. The control system was formerly known as the Censorate. The censors of the Han Dynasty and other dynasties were very important in history. We believe that Comrade Yu and all the supervisors will be able to follow the Premier's instructions, expose corruption, and achieve the goal of political integrity. Next, Chairman Chiang delivered an instructive address, hoping that they could follow the Premier's regulations, earnestly perform the duties of supervision, and that the integrity of the revolutionary government would begin today. Afterwards, Yu delivered a reply, and the meeting adjourned. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing - The revised full text of Control Yuan President Yu Youren's inaugural address is as follows: Chairman, Representatives, Comrades: The Control Yuan began preparations immediately after the establishment of the new Five-Yuan system. Changes in the responsible personnel and the difficulty in selecting committee members required great caution. Therefore, preparations have continued until now without completion. For many years, I, Youren, have been scattered and my energy has waned. Moreover, I am full of faults and ask myself, "I should be supervised; how can I supervise others?" However, due to the election by the Fourth Plenary Session, I could not refuse the orders of the Party and the country. Therefore, today, I respectfully and cautiously swore an oath to assume the position of President of the Control Yuan, to carry out the supervisory powers within the Five-Power system created by the Premier. Although my personal ability and contribution are extremely lacking, I am confident that the Five-Power system was specially created by the Premier. Striving to uphold the Premier's great principles and laws is the responsibility of all party members and will certainly be supported by all comrades in the Party and compatriots throughout the country. Therefore, I dare not hesitate and respectfully devote myself to my duties. I also respectfully accept the instructions of the Chairman and the representatives. The harm done to the people's government by corrupt officials and bureaucrats is constantly on my mind, and I want to eradicate them at all times and in all places. However, there have been many disturbances due to the use of troops to suppress rebellions, and little time for rectifying officialdom. The Fourth Plenary Session was held after the pacification of the disaster, and it was decided to immediately refresh politics and rectify discipline in order to establish and complete the work of political tutelage. Representative Zhang encouraged us to eliminate corrupt officials and bureaucrats and said that local bullies and evil gentry also arise from corrupt officials and bureaucrats. I, Youren, believe that warlords who endanger the country and harm the people are nothing more than corrupt officials and bureaucrats. Last year, the government used military force to eliminate the reactionary forces. If there are no political methods to thoroughly clean up all filth, then the military victory is equal to zero. The meaning of the congress is not only negative, to clarify officialdom and relieve the people's suffering, but also positive, to consolidate the Party's political power and realize the construction of the Three Principles of the People. The urgent task at present is to make all those who perform public duties dare not do what they should not do passively and actively do what they should do. If those who perform public duties can actively do what they should do, then the success of political tutelage will also be easy. Therefore, the establishment of the Control Yuan and the exercise of its powers are extremely urgent. I, Youren, must work hard to prepare for its early establishment. The advantage of the control system in politics is that it is a kind of prior restriction. The people authorize the government to govern and enable it to execute its powers. If there is no good system, it will create many obstacles. Originally, the exercise of control power in China has a long history. The positions of the officials of the Censorate in past dynasties were very important. In my early years, I opened a school and lectured on how certain officials of the Censorate had courage, how certain officials of the Censorate had integrity, and how certain officials of the Censorate could sacrifice for the country. The rise and fall of politics in almost every generation depended on the Censorate. To this day, when history records that a certain dynasty valued the Censorate, then its politics must have been enlightened and the people must have enjoyed blessings. If a certain dynasty despised the Censorate, drove out the Censorate, or killed the Censorate, then the misfortune of that dynasty was the same as the fate of the Censorate. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Imperial Censor Jiang Chunlin and other gentlemen used their hearts to embellish the last page of the Qing history. However, the government lost its principles and the people's hearts were long dissolved, and it could not be saved by the wisdom of one person. However, those who call Jiang Chunlin by name today still admire his character. As for the system of supervision in past dynasties, the officials of speech were mainly responsible for picking up omissions and making up for deficiencies, offering advice when things happened, and the officials of investigation were mainly responsible for impeaching official evils and rectifying discipline. The control system created by the Premier especially emphasized the exercise of the power of impeachment. When the Premier spoke about the Five-Power Constitution, he quoted the words of the American scholar Batchelder, saying that China's power of impeachment is a good reconciliation method between freedom and government. We speculate that the meaning of this is that the control system can make the lower levels unable to deceive the upper levels and the upper levels unable to hide from supervision. Control Yuan President Yu Youren takes office</p>

<p>Personnel in the government and the people are mediators without axes and axes. They can prevent the people from being harmed by policies and a few unscrupulous officials. Otherwise, officials will rely on their positions to commit adultery and violate the law, and the enforcers can only punish them afterwards. The disasters suffered by the people due to a policy error and the corruption and illegality of some unscrupulous officials cannot be compensated by punishing one or two people. Therefore, the exercise of the power of impeachment is exactly what is meant by establishing the wind, making those who are public-minded stop with fear of punishment, or even blaming the virtuous and expecting greater achievements. In modern European and American countries, the power of impeachment is entrusted to the parliament. The Premier's creation is to adopt the good rules of ancient China and refer to the new regulations of European and American countries to formulate a constitution to build a country. The power of supervision is exercised by a special agency established by the government. Its scope is larger and more solemn. Therefore, the task of exercising the power of supervision should be to be the claws and teeth of the country, the throat and tongue of the people, and the vanguard of the Three Principles of the People. Although my ability is limited, I dare not but strive to select supervisory committee members carefully after taking office, and I must be extremely careful to base the supervision and impeachment on the Premier's instructions and the Party's platform, policies, and resolutions. People in the past often said that it is better to let the officials of speech make mistakes than to let the country have oversights. The so-called "one husband speaks frankly, and all officials are frightened" is precisely the special spirit of the control system, and it is also the duty of I, Youren, to accept the position and serve the public. We respectfully read the Premier's speech on the Five-Power Constitution and deeply regret that the Five-Power system could not be implemented in the first year of the Republic of China. Now that the new system is established, it should be able to comfort the Premier's heart. If it is implemented without effort or done without effect, it will be a sin against the Premier and make the Premier in heaven feel even more regret. Therefore, I, Youren, sincerely hope that before the National Assembly convenes, the National Government can establish the scale of the Five-Power system according to the Premier's will and report to the National Assembly on the trial implementation of complete Five-Power politics in the Party's political tutelage work. At the same time, I sincerely hope that the Chairman, representatives, and comrades will teach me. (2nd Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>The Theory of the United States Lending Silver to China</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been many methods of lending money to China transmitted by American telegrams, and the most incomprehensible one is the theory of lending a large amount of raw silver to China. This proposal was first advocated by Senator Gammon of the United States. According to American telegrams, the special committee members of the Senate Committee on Commerce advocated lending a large amount of raw silver to China after a meeting. They plan to ask the Foreign Affairs Committee to engage in contracting. Their reason is that the sharp drop in silver prices is related to the decline in Sino-American trade. They firmly believe that lending money to China can increase the world's silver prices and China's purchasing power, but their words are contrary to our people's intentions. Everyone knows that the reason why world silver prices are falling day by day is due to the large amount of silver coins. The more silver the United States imports into China, the more incompatible the supply and demand will be. Seeing that silver prices are falling more and more, how can it increase the world's silver prices? Moreover, the weak purchasing power of China is due to the high price of gold and the high price of goods. If silver is lent to China, it will not be able to reduce the price of goods, and even if China is able to slightly revitalize its business due to obtaining this loan, its impact on the people's purchasing power is very small. The fundamental way to increase the people's purchasing power is to have fundamental methods, and it will never be in this raw silver loan. The United States' plan for its own trade with China is not the best policy, and the Chinese economists are discussing various restrictive methods to resist the import of raw silver to save the low silver prices. Therefore, I know that the proposal of American committee member Bettman has not been carefully considered.</p>

<p>Reuters, Allahabad, 1st: Leaders of the All-India National Congress gathered today, with Gandhi in attendance, to discuss the issue of peace negotiations. The discussion lasted a considerable amount of time. Judging from the trend of the discussions, the National Congress is prepared to negotiate, but only if: (1) A general amnesty for political prisoners is granted; (2) Peaceful picketing is permitted; (3) Actions that violated the Salt Law are not punished; (4) Various oppressive plans are withdrawn. The general opinion is that peace is hopeless if the above points are not recognized. The leadership meeting passed a resolution reiterating the decision of the working committee that the non-violent resistance movement must continue. The resolution also stated that the boycott of foreign cloth must continue until the nation has the right to completely ban the import of foreign cloth or impose high tariffs to restrict the import of foreign cloth.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Makes Efforts to Understand the Diet</h3>
<p>Government Bill Decided to be Fundamentally Revised</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 2nd: With the question battle at the House of Representatives' Budget Committee coming to an end today, the center of the political battle will shift to the Diet. Yesterday afternoon, a special cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence in Nagata-cho to coordinate countermeasures for the Diet and the handling of important bills. Prime Minister Hara Takashi and all cabinet members attended the discussion, which lasted over two hours. As a result, it was decided that the Diet would take a strong stance on issues such as the economic recession and overestimation of tax revenue, and if a resolution is proposed, the government should exert all efforts to engage in efforts of understanding while paying attention to the strategies of anti-government Diet members and strive to guard against causing a crisis. Next, the handling of important bills such as the Labor Union Bill, the Election Law Amendment Bill, the Women's Suffrage Bill, the Relief Law, etc. was coordinated. Opinions differed on the specific content of the discussions and it was difficult to reach a consensus. Prime Minister Hara Takashi and the majority of cabinet members advocated a "do nothing" approach, saying that even if the bills were important, it would be better to revise their content if they were criticized by the world. As a result, it was decided to revise most of the important bills. For example, the bills related to the Ministry of Home Affairs all violated the initial statements of Interior Minister Adachi. For example, the most important point of the Election Law Amendment, the residential restriction, which was reduced to half a year, is now abolished and remains at one year. The idea of lowering the age of women's suffrage to 20 years has also been rejected. The Labor Union Bill has been significantly revised and submitted to the Diet, and the implementation of the Relief Law will also be postponed. These important bills, which the government boasted to the public last year, all violate the expectations of the people and are completely lacking in excellence, especially Adachi. It remains to be seen how the Interior Minister will properly handle future countermeasures.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 2nd: Today's official Diet session opened at 10:00 AM. Accountant Katsuta took the stage to continue questioning countermeasures for rice prices, rural problems, and what the government's policy is for rescuing the rural areas. He also questioned whether the government believes that it should reduce the cost of compulsory education to rescue farmers. Finance Minister Inoue responded that, regarding the rescue of rural areas, he had convened village and town chiefs to exchange opinions since last year, eased savings deposits, and started to organize other things. He also stated that a fundamental reform of the compulsory education system is currently being studied. Inoue also declared the government's financial policy after the gold embargo, saying that today's Japan is in a period of restructuring and that if it is negligent in restructuring now, it will be too late to regret it in the future. In short, Mr. Katsuta and I differ in our positions on the fundamental issue. In response to Mr. Katsuta's three days of lengthy questioning, he gave a general answer. Next, Kawamura (Koyu) took the stage to question the Musha Incident, the Manchuria-Mongolia issue. He said that the current severe economic recession was caused by the government's policy-less gold embargo, that the government should not only not feel its mistakes but should also be responsible. In addition, he said that the tax reduction obtained from the London Treaty was only about a tenth of a yuan. Can this dispel the economic recession? Regarding the government's optimistic attitude towards the railway encirclement policy in Manchuria, which disregards the treaty, he asked Finance Minister Hara whether it is okay to leave it alone. He then mentioned the seriousness of the Musha Incident and questioned Minister Matsuda about his responsibility before stepping down. Foreign Minister Hara responded that since our authorities have not started constructing new Chinese railways, countermeasures are currently being studied and that we are now seeking to coordinate with China on railway issues in order to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity. Subsequently, Finance Minister Inoue, Minister of the Army Ugaki, and Minister Matsuda each stood up to answer. The meeting adjourned at noon. It was decided to rest for one day for tomorrow's official meeting.</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister's Trip to Washington DC</h3>
<p>May Be Related to Remedying the Silver Market</p>
<p>Truth of Talks Remains Secret</p>
<p>Silver Loan Report to be Prepared</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 1st: Canadian Prime Minister Bennett has been in Washington DC for three days, engaging in busy meetings with government officials. This afternoon, he left for Ottawa. Bennett told people only that he was here to visit the new Canadian embassy and did not mention anything else. The general public anticipates that what he discussed was the matter of low silver prices, paying particular attention to the section on international action to restore China's purchasing power. However, the truth of the talks has remained a secret. Last night, Bennett dined with Federal Reserve Chairman Meyer, presumably discussing financial issues.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 1st: Senator Pittman's subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee will submit a report on Friday to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee proposing a large loan of raw silver to China. According to someone representing Pittman, the report intends to request that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee work towards an international agreement to lend China hundreds of millions of ounces of raw silver. In recent months, Pittman's subcommittee has investigated the reasons for the decline in Sino-American trade and sought the opinions of various officials to determine the relationship between the drastic fall in silver prices and the decline in Sino-American trade. Pittman firmly believes that lending debt to China can increase the world's silver prices and China's purchasing power, as well as reduce unemployment and other economic hardships. Some say that China has already stored a lot of silver and does not need to add more. What is urgently needed now is to increase the price of all silver. There is great concern outside about the report of Pittman's subcommittee. Many people now say that the report of Pittman's subcommittee may not be able to be put into practice, as its leaders and the leaders of the Democratic Party are now fiercely competing for the sake of relief for the unemployed and disaster relief.</p>

<h3>Local By-Election Held in Australia</h3>
<p>Labor Government Fails as a Result</p>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 1st: An important by-election was held in Parks, Australia. Australian Prime Minister Scullin personally directed the campaign, but the Labor government failed as a result. The Nationalist Party candidate actually defeated the Labor representative with a majority of 8,833 votes. Cabinet members are mostly optimistic about this result, believing that it was caused by the long-term finances of Treasurer Theodore. If a general election were held today, the Labor government might be difficult to maintain. The Senate is currently able to direct the government. If Theodore remains in office, the Senate may obstruct government affairs in order to force Theodore to leave office or force a general election.</p>

<h3>Central Party Headquarters and National Government's Memorial Week</h3>
<p>At 9 AM on the 2nd, the Central Party Headquarters held the 97th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the auditorium. Central Committee members Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu, Ma Chaojun, Miao Peicheng, and others, as well as staff from various departments and committees and guests, totaling approximately 500-600 people, attended. Chairman Zhang Ji presided. After the ceremony, the chairman reported, stating in brief: Today is the first time I have met with all of you comrades here. First, I have a few words to explain. I ask myself before Dr. Sun Yat-sen and all of you comrades and feel very ashamed. I have not been able to strictly abide by the party's discipline, but Dr. Sun Yat-sen did not abandon me and still took me in. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, I was once again received by everyone, and I feel very grateful. I have been living in exile overseas for many years. My father died eight years ago and has not been buried. Recently, I wanted to return home to take care of my parents, but I suffered the loss of my mother, making me an unfilial son. The National Government awarded me funeral expenses, and the Central Committee specially sent Comrade Li Shizeng to offer condolences. As a person who is disloyal to the party and the nation and unfilial to my parents, I have no place in heaven and earth. This is what I am here to apologize to all of you comrades for today. I was ordered by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee to attend today's Central Memorial Week to report on two issues that I would like to propose for discussion with everyone: border issues and rural issues. Border issues are very important to our party, and the scope is also very broad. I remember that Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said that after the revolution is successful, we must first establish the capital in Nanjing to solve the problems of the eighteen provinces of mainland China, and then take a further step to establish the capital in Lanzhou to solve the problems of Xinjiang, Tibet, and Mongolia. The third step is to establish the capital in Kashgar, which will solve the problems of all of Asia. Dr. Sun Yat-sen also said that we should start from the eastern port of Zhapu and build a beautiful national road called the Northwest Road, which would pass through Nanjing and connect to Lanzhou. This shows the importance of the Asian issue. How should we make the Three Principles of the People reach the northwest and be established in Asia? This is a construction to save humanity, not imperialism. I recall that when Chen Jiongming rebelled, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was on Guanyin Mountain, drawing maps every day, always drawing towards the northwest, which shows Dr. Sun Yat-sen's attention to the border. The autumn before last year, I traveled to Japan, and last winter I went to Liaoning and visited Jidun Road. I know very little about the northwest, so I want to say a few words about the northeast. The northeast and the northwest are equally important, and the northeast is even more dangerous. If we want to solve the difficulties of the people's livelihood and consolidate the foundation of the country, the northeast issue will immediately come to our minds. Comrade Zhang Hanqing has done a very good job in maintaining order in the three northeastern provinces, and he has put in a lot of effort. We should take a look at the situation in the northeast. There are many areas where we should assist the three northeastern provinces, and the railway issue, forest issue, immigration issue, and Korean issue of the three northeastern provinces are all urgent matters at present. The opposition party and the headquarters of the military cliques, the General Staff Headquarters, of Japanese imperialism are still using all their strength to attack the Minsei Party cabinet. It is still unknown what kind of disputes will arise in the future, and I would like to ask all comrades to pay attention. After Mr. Zhang's report, the ceremony was completed and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>At 10 AM on the same morning, the National Government held Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Zhang Ji, Liu Shangqing, Shao Yuanchong, Ma Fuxiang, Ma Chaojun, Zhu Peide, He Yaohui, Zhang Fengjiu, Zhang Mojun, Ru Yuli, Zhang Wohua, Li Shuhua, Chen Shaokuan, Lin Xiang, and other officials and the entire staff of the National Government, totaling over 300 people, attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony. Wang Chonghui delivered a speech stating in brief that since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to convene the National Assembly on May 5th, there has been some misunderstanding outside, believing that the constitution can be promulgated and constitutional government can be implemented. There are two reasons for this: one is that they have not read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, and the other is that they have read it but do not agree with it and want to use the opportunity to achieve personal ambitions. It must be known that the purpose of the revolution is to realize the Three Principles of the People, but there must be a certain path. In the past, there have been constitutions, and even Cao Kun had a constitution, but where was the civil rights? Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition is the true civil rights, not using the constitution as a tool. The three stages set are not to give the people power slowly, but to allow the people to obtain true power. Our people have always ignored politics. It must be known that to obtain true civil rights, first, the people must be interested in politics, and second, they must have political knowledge. Otherwise, even if they are given four powers, they will not know how to exercise them. Our goal is to implement local self-government and complete the Three Principles of the People. Since the Third Plenary Session, we have used all our strength to eliminate reactionary forces and have had no time for construction. Now that the country is unified, we sincerely hope that the people will help the period of political tutelage progress so as to achieve the goal of "天下爲公" (The world belongs to everyone). After the speech, the ceremony was completed and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

After the meeting adjourned, the telegram was drafted and sent as follows: "To Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the National Government Chiang, Chairman and Director of Wuhan Headquarters He, Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of Nanchang Lu, Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of Changsha He Junjian: The ravages of the communist bandits have wreaked havoc across the country, and the counties bordering Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have suffered the most. Fields and gardens are barren, villages and markets are in ruins, vitality has been destroyed, and the people's livelihood is withering. This is truly a desperate situation and an unprecedented disaster. Your Excellencies, bearing in mind the suffering of the disaster area, have ordered Army Commander Liu Jianxu of the 28th Army to concurrently manage the bandit suppression affairs in the twelve counties of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border region. Upon hearing this, the masses rejoiced. Considering that Changsha, Xiangyin, Yueyang, Pingjiang, Liuyang, and Liling in Hunan Province, Chongyang and Tongcheng in Hubei Province, and Pingxiang, Wanzai, Tonggu, and Xiushui in Jiangxi Province are all adjacent to each other, with mountains and ridges that are easily exploited by bandits, the bandits disperse when troops arrive and regroup when troops leave. Previous suppressions have repeatedly failed because the people did not plan to defend themselves, and because the stationed troops were frequently transferred, the people suddenly lost protection and were unable to escape, leading to their coercion by the bandits and subsequent redization. This is also a major reason. Therefore, it is difficult to clear strategic passes without permanently stationing heavy troops, and the stationed troops cannot achieve results in a short period of several months. This time, the border defense conference of the three provinces and twelve counties is of one mind and united, and we are determined to completely eliminate banditry. We, the representatives of the people, hereby jointly appeal to Your Excellencies to grant Liu, who also serves as Director, and his subordinate troops permission to permanently garrison the strategic passes of the three provinces' border region and not to transfer them elsewhere, and to set a one-year period for bandit suppression, so that they can lead the people and be responsible for carrying out the task of eliminating bandits and pacifying the disaster victims. The telegram is urgent and we await your orders. Representatives of Changsha Ding Duo, Representative of Chongyang Zeng Songqing, Representative of Tongcheng Wu Shangzhou, Representative of Pingxiang Li Chunming, Representative of Yueyang Tang Ming, Representative of Pingjiang Xiao Lvwu, Representative of Xiangyin Wu Yingduo, Representative of Liuyang Bai Shi jointly kowtow."</p>
<h3>Hankou Butterfield &amp; Swire Wharf Case Resolved</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Hankou Municipal Government previously took over land for the construction of a riverside road and expropriated the godowns of Butterfield &amp; Swire, a British firm stationed in Hankou, which led to negotiations. The Municipal Government submitted the conditions proposed by the company to the Executive Yuan for approval. Instructions were received to exempt wharf dues and reduce road construction donations. The Municipal Government then re-revised the conditions requested by the company, totaling eleven items, and resubmitted them to the Executive Yuan for instructions. The Executive Yuan then instructed the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Finance to hold consultations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened a meeting, and then the Executive Yuan ordered that "according to the report and consultation of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Finance on the case of the Hankou Municipal Government's negotiations with Butterfield &amp; Swire regarding the construction of the riverside road, the circumstances of the repeated meetings and deliberations by dispatched personnel, together with the revised draft, be submitted for approval and implementation." The 91st meeting of the Executive Yuan resolved to approve and order compliance, but it was stated that at the time of approving the conditions, it must be declared that the current measures formulated by the government shall not be deemed to have any hindrance to the issue of navigation rights negotiated between the Chinese and British governments, and the company shall be ordered to submit and verify the property deeds to prove that they are accurate before completing the approval procedures." The Municipal Government immediately ordered Wu Guozhen, Director of the Finance Bureau, to negotiate with the company regarding the submission and verification of the deeds. It was stated that the contract had been sent to the three ministries in Nanjing for review and may now be returned to London. If a letter is sent to request it, it may take a long time. The contract will be submitted and reviewed together when the land registration is carried out in Hankou in the future. The Municipal Council then resolved to comply with the order of the Executive Yuan and immediately approve the conditions. As for the company's deeds, they will be reviewed when land registration is implemented, and it is stated that "the conditions approved this time shall not be deemed to have any hindrance to the issue of navigation rights negotiated between the Chinese and British governments in the future." The case has now been completely resolved, and the 125,000 yuan that should be paid has also been paid by the company. The approved conditions are as follows: (1) Butterfield &amp; Swire shall transfer the riverside land free of charge for the Municipal Government to build roads, with an area as shown in the map. (2) Butterfield &amp; Swire shall not build cargo sheds outside the riverside road, but if the Municipal Government permits other companies to build riverside sheds in the future, the company shall enjoy the same treatment. (3) Butterfield &amp; Swire shall pay 125,000 yuan to the Municipal Government for the construction of new roads, riverside roads, wharves, and filling works in front of the company, but all construction costs for building tunnels or installing aerial transport equipment shall be borne by the company. (4) The new roads, riverside roads, and wharves shall be built according to the drawings shown by the Municipal Government to the company. (5) The company's original right to use the land directly leading to the riverside in front of Butterfield &amp; Swire and the right to berth along the river shall continue to be enjoyed by the company and its successors and assignees without any interference or restriction. (6) Because the Municipality has already taken a section of land from Butterfield &amp; Swire free of charge for the construction of the riverside road, the Municipality shall exempt the company from paying fees for using the riverside and berthing ships along the section of land. Furthermore, this new road can only be used as a highway in the future. If it is not used for this purpose, the Municipality shall allow it to be sold to others and shall not use it for other purposes that would obstruct the company's transportation of goods between the riverside and the warehouses. (7) Before the Hankou Municipal Government implements the collection of wharf taxes on all public and private wharves, the passage of goods from the Butterfield &amp; Swire wharf through the newly built road, whether by air or underground, shall not be subject to wharf taxes or other similar dues. When the Municipal Government implements the collection of wharf taxes on all public and private wharves, the Butterfield &amp; Swire wharf shall naturally comply with the regulations and pay taxes, and shall be entitled to equal treatment in the area under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government. However, the above provisions shall only apply to the goods transported by Butterfield &amp; Swire merchant ships or ships hired by the company, as well as the goods transported from all parties to Butterfield &amp; Swire and transferred by the ships, and the coal transported by all parties to Butterfield &amp; Swire for their own use or for the ships' use. (8) The Municipality shall allow the company to build a tunnel under the new road or install aerial transport equipment on it for the loading and unloading of goods between ships and warehouses, but only to the extent that it does not hinder public traffic. (9) The Municipality shall protect the company's right to lease properties adjacent to the company within the scope of the law.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>(10) When the Municipality expands or reconstructs the riverbank or riverside, the company shall be exempted from paying usage fees, and all its rights shall be retained. (11) The conditions approved by the Municipality shall be submitted to the respective governments for record. (January 31)</p>
<h3>Min River Embankment Case Still Not Prosecuted</h3>
<p>The District Prosecutor's Office Telegraphed to Nanjing for Instructions for the Second Time</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Although there have been reports that the Minhou District Prosecutor's Office will prosecute Jiang Pingfan and Lin Enpu for alleged dereliction of duty in repairing the Min River embankment, they telegraphed the Ministry of Justice a few days ago to inquire whether incumbent officials must be suspended from their duties before they can be dealt with. Subsequently, the Ministry replied that the criminal procedure law does not have special provisions due to status, and if the prosecution conditions of the law are met, the prosecuting prosecutor should handle it cautiously. However, after Yang Shuzhuang returned to Fujian, he argued that the Lin case should be handled by administrative punishment. The Chief Prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Chen Shirong, also met with Yang twice, so he telegraphed the Ministry again for instructions. Various community organizations are paying close attention to this case and recently convened a meeting and resolved: (1) Although there have been reports that the provincial government has discussed exempting the filling of the bridge gate, but no official document has been received, the provincial government should be requested to issue a clear instruction. (2) The court has not yet filed a public prosecution for the alleged dereliction of duty of Jiang and Lin, and the community should issue a statement to promote its realization. At the same time, the Shanghai Fellow Association and other organizations telegraphed that in addition to sending representatives to Nanjing to petition, they also telegraphed the Construction and Civil Affairs Departments of Fujian to find ways to prevent the filling of the bridge gate and hoped that they would be informed at any time so that they could proceed accordingly. It is expected that this case cannot be resolved quickly. (January 29)</p>
<h3>Jin Generals Hold Military Reduction Conference</h3>
<p>Xu Yongchang and Song Zheyuan Successfully Mediate</p>
<p>Shang Zhen and All Generals Have Reached an Understanding</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Since Xu Yongchang returned the night before last, the chaotic situation in Shanxi has been eased through various reconciliations. After a meeting yesterday, there has been a sign of moderation. Xu had a long private meeting with Shang Zhen and Yang Aiyuan the night before last. Yesterday (27th) at 10:00 AM, he invited all army commanders to his private residence to seek opinions. Xu declared that he had agreed with Chairman Shang to convene a conference of all military officers at the headquarters this afternoon to negotiate the specific methods of downsizing. He hoped that everyone would attend in full force at that time and then dispersed. At about 12:00, Shang, Xu, Yang, and Li Runfa, Commander of the Gendarmerie, and Zhou Dai, Commander of the Artillery, arrived at the headquarters first. Subsequently, Sun Chu, Feng Pengzhu, Wang Jingguo, Yang Yaofang, Li Fuying, Li Shengda, Yang Xiaou, Zhang Huizhao, Yang Chengyuan, and other army commanders, as well as Zhao Chengshou, Commander of the Cavalry, and Rong Honglu, Commander of the Garrison, arrived one after another. The formal meeting began in the headquarters conference room at more than 2:00 PM. First, Shang, Xu, and Yang successively reported on the results of the Tianjin meeting. Then, the army commanders explained the true meaning of the clever telegram. There was a good understanding between each other. Shang and others expressed that they had no prejudices and only hoped that the reorganization could be carried out smoothly for the benefit of the country and the people. The army commanders then successively spoke, stating that it was difficult to implement the plan of four armies and eight divisions as determined in Tianjin. It seemed more appropriate to reorganize gradually. If attention was not paid to this and it was done rashly, it would inevitably corrupt the local area and cause harm to the people. The consensus was to reorganize the Jin army into ten divisions, each division cutting three regiments and retaining six regiments, with a total reduction of about one-third of the personnel. The division commanders remained the same, but the wartime transitional army commander positions were eliminated. Shang and others expressed their agreement. This was immediately taken as the standard. After a long discussion, Wang Jingguo spoke and asked Shang to accept Fu Zuoyi's telegram, saying that doing so would not only make the reorganization easier but also conform to the principle of military and civilian separation. The army commanders also expressed their support for this. Shang stated that he also extremely agreed with this proposal, but it had already been stated in a clear order and he could relinquish his concurrent army commander position at an appropriate time. The army commanders were all satisfied with Shang's statement. It was decided to continue the meeting at the headquarters from the 28th and send someone to Shenyang to ask Zhang for instructions after a concrete plan was obtained. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM in the evening. It is reported that Song Zheyuan exerted a great deal of effort to mediate in this meeting in a private capacity. The text of the clever telegram of each army commander is appended as follows: "Since the end of the military affairs, Chu has been waiting for punishment in the army, waiting for your orders. I have previously telegraphed for instructions so that there will be something to follow. The intention of Chu and all officers is extremely sincere, because after this political change, they have learned from the pain and are willing to listen to your orders with all their strength, and make every effort to assist in the unification. This time, if they cannot make a great contribution to the central government, they will never be willing to remain outside the establishment of the National Army. This time, according to the private intentions of one or two people, the Jin army was reorganized into four armies, which is very different from the actual situation of the Jin army and is difficult to implement. Chu and others repeatedly sent people to Tianjin to report to Chairman Shang, but they were not accepted. They had no choice but to directly telegraph to your seat, hoping that you would appreciate their stupidity and reorganize the Jin army into the National Army so that they can be treated the same as the central army and serve your seat. Otherwise, they will only disarm and return to their fields to avoid guilt. Sincerely, for the sake of the permanent unification of the country and for the sake of the future of the Jin army, they dare not make a mistake again and again. Chu, Yang Xiaou, Wang Jingguo, Li Shengda, Li Fuying, Yang Yaofang, Yang Chengyuan, Zhang Huizhao, and Feng Pengzhu kowtow."</p>
<p>At the same time, Fu Zuoyi replied to Shang Zhen's telegram, and also sent it to the army commanders. The text is as follows: "I have just replied to a telegram from Chairman Shang, saying that I am very grateful for the emphasis on words and I extremely agree. When I left Tianjin, after the order was issued, I then sent a letter to Deputy Commander Zhang, saying that there were too many people in Jin who lost their jobs after the Jin affairs, and I was afraid that it would be difficult to solve. I was willing to give up the positions of army commander and division commander to respect the overall situation, but I was not allowed by the Deputy Commander and did not dare to bother again. Now I am grateful for your instructions, which are true to my original intentions. I take the Deputy Commander's knowledge as a cut and am willing to help make today's situation. If the situation can be resolved by avoiding the seat and giving up my position, I would be blessed. If there are still difficulties, I ask Duke Qi to be ten times more righteous than me and to have also received the Deputy Commander's knowledge, and to let one out of the positions of Chairman and Army Commander, so that the facts can be accommodated. I foolishly believe that the central government has handed over the Jin affairs to the Deputy Commander with full authority, originally to settle things and calm people. Deputy Commander Zhang cherishes peace, sacrifices himself to achieve it, and has even more suffering. Our Jin comrades value obedience and are deeply grateful to Deputy Commander Zhang. Although today's situation is in fact inevitable, I think it has not been said in the Tianjin meeting. However, if Duke Qi and I can voluntarily apply to vacate our positions and solve the Jin affairs as soon as possible, we can not only satisfy the Deputy Commander's prestige but also avoid being ashamed of the elders of one party. Otherwise, the delay will violate the central government's generosity and betray the Deputy Commander's intention to be complete. If the local area is corrupted, the harm is unbearable. I think Duke Qi is also aware of this. I only seek to benefit the overall situation and my personal position is not a problem. I tearfully reply, hoping that you will examine it. Fu Zuoyi kowtows and raises his head." (January 28)</p>
<h3>Han Deqin Appointed Garrison Commander of Nanchang</h3>
<p>The 52nd Division and the Independent 14th Brigade Are Under Han's Command</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since Zhang Huizan, Commander of the 18th Division, took office as the garrison commander of Nanchang last year, he has been effective in maintaining the security of the provincial capital. However, Zhang's division suffered a defeat in the Longgang battle on New Year's Day. Commander-in-Chief Lu believed that the rear defense of the provincial capital was very important for security reasons. In addition to appointing Dai Yue, Deputy Division Commander of the 18th Division, as acting garrison commander, he telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang and asked him to appoint another person to take over the position in order to take charge of the responsibility. Chiang believed that the 18th Division urgently needed to be concentrated for replenishment and reorganization, and the 52nd Division had already arrived in the provincial capital in full force, so he appointed Han Deqin, Commander of the division, to concurrently serve as the garrison commander of Nanchang. Commander-in-Chief Lu recently received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, which read: "Commander-in-Chief Lu Jianjian: I hereby appoint Han Deqin to concurrently serve as the garrison commander of Nanchang. The 52nd Division and the Independent 14th Brigade under Liu Yi are under the command of the commander. In addition to separately ordering Brigade Commander Liu, you should comply with this order and publish the seal of office and report the assumption of office within a time limit. This order is from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek." After receiving the order, Lu telegraphed Commander Han to inform him and ordered Dai Yue to prepare for the handover. After receiving the order, Commander Han arrived at the garrison headquarters at 12:00 noon on the 29th to take over the seal of office and announced that Li Wenshi was the chief of staff of the headquarters (formerly the adjutant of the headquarters), Ge Jinrong was the chief of the staff office, Bao was the chief of the enforcement office, and Liu Chuying was the chief of the military supplies office. The other officers also had some changes. Leaders from all walks of life in the province, such as Chief of Staff Xiao of the Ninth Route Army and Mayor Gong, all went to the garrison headquarters to congratulate him. Currently, the majority of the 52nd Division has moved to the Xiajiang and Xinyu areas, and the division headquarters is still stationed in Nanchang. The Independent 14th Brigade is stationed at the Niuhang Station and the ramparts around the city. There is still a special curfew after 10:00 PM every night, and no one is allowed to pass without a pass to prevent bandits and communists from mixing in and causing trouble. The security of the provincial capital is very solid. (January 30)</p>

<h3>Local Correspondence, Suzhou</h3>

Upon receiving the report, Captain Tan of the Wujiang Water Patrol immediately dispatched Squad Leader Zhou Yaohui of the Second Squad, who led his team on a departure the day before yesterday. Near Maoqi Port at the newly opened port, they encountered six or seven bandit ships. They immediately opened fire and fiercely attacked the bandits, who also returned fire and stubbornly resisted. After half an hour of fierce fighting, the bandits finally could not hold out and fled. As a result, in addition to killing two bandits on the spot, they also captured a Jiangbei boat from the bandit side, two rifles, and rescued a hostage, Xu Wenlong (a Hengjing native in his twenties). Together with boatman Wang Shoushan, they were brought back to the team headquarters for interrogation.</p>

They were wearing various colors of clothing and each carried a weapon. They searched the house and looted over two hundred yuan. Banditry Rampant on the Border of Wu and Kun: In recent days, dozens of bandit ships have appeared in areas such as the Dianshan Lake, Lutian Lake, and Bailian Lake on the border of Wu and Kun. They scattered in different directions across the lake surface in groups of three or four to five or six, specializing in robbing passing ships and kidnapping local people, refusing to leave. Yesterday (the 2nd), the town head of Chenmu Town petitioned the county government to send troops to suppress them. After receiving the report, County Chief Huang immediately ordered the police brigade to send a team to pursue and suppress the bandits, and also telegraphed the Third District of the Water Police to send a team to assist.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Tragic News of Torture by Scalding: The house of Wu Xingquan of Wu Jia, Five Groups, Third Regiment outside the West City was suddenly broken into by several bandits at midnight yesterday. They tied up all the members of the Wu family, young and old. The bandits then lit two foreign candles, removed Wu's wife's lower garment, and scalded her lower body, forcing her to reveal the location of the hidden money. However, the Wu family was not wealthy. Despite her pleas, the bandits did not believe her and thought she was intentionally hiding the money, so they scalded her more severely. Wu's wife's lower body was scalded until the skin was broken and blood flowed like a river, causing her to faint. The bandits then searched the house and only found a little over twenty silver dollars, which they took with them. Wu's wife's life is now in grave danger and it is feared that she will not survive. Change of Head of the Lower Sand Field: Lu Junchi, the head of the Lower Sand Field in this county, requested permission from the Songjiang Surveillance Deputy Envoy to resign due to taking up a position in the Jiangxi military.

It is rumored that the new head will come to Nanhui in the next few days to take over.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Continued Hearing of the Case of the Inspector Raping a Concubine: Since arriving in Wuxi some days ago, Zhou Runshi, the police inspector of the Department of Civil Affairs, felt lonely while away from home, so he summoned a local prostitute, Wang Lihong, to accompany him for the night. Later, he had an affair with Zhou Xingzhen, the concubine of Shen Xiang, a local resident, and they secretly went to Suzhou together. Shen Xiang found out and went to Suzhou to find them, handing them over to the police at the first station in the Chang District. Zhou Runshi was then released by patrol officer Wang Shiyi of the station. Zhou Xingzhen was taken back to Wuxi by Shen Xiang. Shen was unwilling to let the matter drop and brought Xingzhen to the Public Security Bureau for a trial. It is now known that this case has caused a stir in Suzhou and Wuxi. The County Party Consolidation Committee is paying close attention to this matter. Zhou Runshi, as a police inspector, dared to openly solicit prostitutes and rape married women while performing his duties, which is a disgrace to official integrity and should be severely punished according to the law. Yesterday was the date of the 87th regular meeting of the committee, and this issue was specifically raised for discussion. As a result, it was decided to submit a report to the Provincial Party Consolidation Committee for review and handling. In addition, Director Xu of the Public Security Bureau yesterday prepared a document on this case and submitted it to the county government, which was then forwarded by County Chief Pan to Director Hu of the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions and review.</p>
<p>Bandit Robbery at Night in Kaihua Township: On the night before last at 12 o'clock, more than ten bandits suddenly came to the house of Xu Houqing, a villager in Shangxiang Village near Shitao Town, Fourteenth District (Kaihua Township). They were armed with handguns, iron rulers, wooden sticks, and other weapons. They broke into the house and dragged the owner, Xu Houqing, from his bed, tied him up with ropes, and forced him to reveal the location of the hidden money. They then rummaged through chests and cabinets and looted extensively for half an hour before leaving with their loot. Afterwards, it was determined that silver dollars, jewelry, clothing, and other items worth over a hundred yuan had been stolen. After this incident, the town head of the town, Deputy Zhou Jinghua, Shen Yunbi, and local figures are trying to repair the fold by reorganizing the original local defense corps. The necessary expenses are donated by local figures, and the members of the corps are filled by merchants and villagers. It is now actively underway.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Rice Merchant Attempts Suicide by Drowning: Xu Yuanyuan Huanji Rice Shop outside the Dadongmen in Taian Street of this county is managed by Zhou Disheng. He usually worked diligently, but unexpectedly, the day before yesterday (the 30th), Zhou resigned from his position for unknown reasons. His brother did not agree. Zhou suddenly wrote a poem of four lines that night: "Unable to bear the past, I think of the past, having endured countless hardships. I have no hope for the country or the family; I only wish for eternal sleep." He then went to the Nantang Sanli Bridge and attempted to drown himself. At that time, someone happened to be passing by and heard a sound in the river and splashing water. Realizing that someone had fallen into the river, he shouted for help and rescued Zhou. After asking his name, he sent someone to inform his brother, who took him back to the store for treatment. He is expected to survive.</p>
<p>The Hupu Smuggling Case; Examination of Plaintiff and Defendant: On the afternoon of July 28th last year, Shao Qiubai of the Hupu Customs Bureau checked a ship carrying smuggled opium. Afterward, he sent eleven packages of opium to the county. However, the local villagers all saw that the amount seized was more than that. Shen Muman then accused Shao, the head of the branch bureau, to the county and the National Opium Suppression Committee of embezzling the opium. The Opium Suppression Committee instructed the Department of Civil Affairs to thoroughly investigate. As a result, there was no concrete reply. The Department of Civil Affairs believed that this matter was serious and could not be resolved simply by recording a demerit against the head of the Public Security Bureau, and ordered the county to conduct a thorough investigation. Upon receiving the order, the county government of this county summoned the plaintiff Shen Muman and others on the 29th. Shen's trial staff interrogated them. According to Shen Muman, a total of one hundred and thirty-two pounds of opium were found on the ship that day, but only eleven pounds were sent to the county. Director Shao was clearly guilty of embezzlement. Many people saw the opium being hidden in flour bags and rice baskets when it was seized that day. In addition, there was also a carrying basket, so it was not just one hundred and thirty-two pounds. Moreover, after the opium was brought to the bureau, the former district head Hu Zhenkang and the assistant requested Director Shao to jointly inspect and seal it, but Director Shao refused. This point alone is suspicious, please pay attention to the court. The defendant Shao Qiubai stated that on that day, eleven packages of opium were found in the compartment under the stove of the ship, which were packed in flour bags and brought back to the bureau. As for the request from the former district head Hu to inspect and seal the opium, please summon the former district head Hu for questioning. The court then adjourned to await the summons of the former district head Hu for further verification.</p>
<p>The Twists and Turns Before the Opening of the Huitong Kun-Chang Shuttle Service: The Huitong Steamship Bureau received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs to add a Kun-Chang early shuttle service, which was scheduled to start on February 1st. However, the Taidong, Changqing, Tongli, and other three companies previously disputed the route and were involved in litigation. Seeing that the Department of Construction had approved the opening of the Huitong Bureau's service, they felt resentful. Yesterday, they again filed a complaint with the county, stating that the department license submitted by the Huitong Bureau was for both Huitong and its steamship, using one license for two purposes to deceive the government, requesting a thorough investigation and requesting that its opening be temporarily suspended. After receiving the complaint, the county government ordered Chen Qiwei, the director of the Construction Bureau, to investigate whether the Huitong Bureau was using one license for two purposes and report back. As for the opening issue, it was allowed to proceed first due to transportation relations.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Four Thieves Captured by the Minghuang Police Station: Zheng Peizhou, director of the Seventh Branch Bureau of the Minghuang Public Security Bureau in Wuyi, received a report that bandits were hiding near Shangdian. On January 31st, he led a team to the location and captured the bandits Yang Zhiren, Monk Juexin, and Zhao Yuda. He then went to ZhouShu township and captured Lu Juda.

The nearby fire brigade rushed to put out the fire, but the old man Sheng Heida perished in the fire.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Robbery in the Sibei Siwei area: The house of Feng Shouchang, a farmer in the Siwei area near Wubaodun, about three miles outside the North Gate, was preparing for the funeral of his grandfather Renyi on the night before last (the 30th) at about 8:00 p.m. Suddenly, three or four people dressed in black military uniforms and several people in plain clothes, armed with box cannons, came to the inner room under the pretext of searching for opium. They searched the drawer and took fifty yuan in foreign currency and fled, firing a shot to show their power. Afterwards, the first branch of the Public Security Bureau was notified and the city gates were closed to search in all directions. The victim claimed that several people were wearing white-brimmed hats. Chief Cui reported to the headquarters, which immediately gathered the police team and patrol officers. One patrol officer from the eighth platoon of the third police station inside the Xiaochenghuang Temple in Wanglaiting outside the West Gate and two police officers were suddenly missing. After investigation, the victim identified them as so-and-so, and they were immediately arrested and sent to the county yesterday for interrogation.</p>
<p>Provincial Order Disapproves Bandit's Surrender: The bandit Gao, a primary school student, has been causing trouble in Xixiang. Jin, the head of the Sixth District, had previously requested the county government in the past year to telegraph the Department of Civil Affairs to allow Gao to surrender. The Department of Civil Affairs, believing that Gao's surrender was not sincere, issued an order refusing the request and ordering that he continue to be apprehended. Upon receiving the order, the county government forwarded it to its subordinates to comply.</p>
<p>Former Prison Official Takes Office: Lu Ying, a prison official in Jiangyin, was ordered by the High Court to be transferred to the Shanghai Second Prison Guard Post and replaced by Zeng Guochen, who is scheduled to take office today (the 1st).</p>

Only seven of the accompanying staff arrived one after another. On the 1st, a notice (Office of the Deputy Envoy of the Southern Salt Transport) was posted at the entrance of the Transport Office. It is understood that Envoy Wang Zhang Huxian first went to the capital to meet with the department before going to Huaibei. The staff of the Transport Office here are rushing to complete the procedures. There is talk of going to the north in three days, but it is said that the procedures for separating the files of Huainan and Huaibei are complicated and are being rushed day and night. It seems that they will need until February 10th to complete them. It seems uncertain whether the staff will be able to go to the north in three days. The Results of the Primary School Representatives' Petition: The primary school salary arrears case was previously pushed by representatives Yang Youqing, Gao Zhongshi, Jin Shengfu, and others to the Department of Education to petition. Now, the representatives have returned to Yangzhou on the 31st, saying that the Department of Education has accepted the petition and Secretary Hou Baosan has agreed to come to Yangzhou to have discussions with Director Chen Da of the Department of Education. There is a concrete solution.</p>
<p>The Arrest of a Major Criminal for Trafficking People: A local officer of the Xima Tou Ferry Station in Li Dian Zhen, Yixia, saw a man and a woman who seemed suspicious. As the officer was about to approach them, he saw the woman try to throw herself into the river. He questioned her, and she claimed that her name was Su Xiaofenzi and that she was a servant in a certain family in Xiannv Miao. Zhang Huaishan and Tao Dengwu had trafficked her here and intended to sell her to Nanjing. The officer took the man and woman together to the Third District Office and sent them to the competent Public Security Bureau. Yesterday (the 31st), they were escorted to the city and sent to the hospital for punishment.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>County Government Appoints a Large Number of Personnel: Xu Zusheng, the County Chief of Yangzhou, is about to leave his post and is trying his best to accommodate all parties. Yesterday, he appointed Sun Hongling and Su Kaiyuan as Section Chiefs, and E Zhensheng as the Third District Chief. The originally appointed Lu Ruli was transferred to the First District Chief. Zhu Binggan, the Fifth District Chief, resigned, and He Yuqing was appointed to succeed him. Many other secretaries and bailiffs were also added. It is indeed a grand departure.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Regular Dredging of Qianbu Creek: The local residents of Qianbu Creek previously discussed asking for dredging of the creek. Since the creek's boundary is between Songjiang and Fengxian, the Eighth District Office sent a letter to Yexie Township in the county for agreement. The county then sent a request to the Department of Construction to schedule a joint dredging. The necessary expenses, except for the amount already approved by the Department of Finance for this county to be collected at a rate of five cents to one dime per acre from various dredging maps, the Songjiang side will be responsible for four-tenths of the total amount, and yesterday (the 31st), representatives from various villages near the embankment were convened at the Zhuanghang District Office to organize a river works committee to oversee the handling of the matter. Xi Yusheng has been appointed as the director of river works, and Zhang Dapei and others have been appointed as economic committee members. The completion date is set for one and a half months from February 25th.</p>
<p>The Official Deeds of the Yanchang Territory Will Be Issued by the District: The business of issuing official deeds in this county has been assigned to each district office. It is also stipulated that 2% of the deed price will be extracted to fund the town. The County Executive Committee has found that the official deeds used for the salt farms and paddies in the county are still issued by the Qingcun and Yuanpu Farms themselves, and the donations from the proceeds of the deed have not been collected according to regulations, causing many obstacles in handling the matter. Therefore, yesterday, the County Government sent a letter to the two farm heads, informing them that the issuance of all official deeds and the method of extracting the donations must be uniformly managed by the district offices where the farms are located, according to the county's precedents, to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Two Bandits Executed by Firing Squad: The bandits Yao Fugeng and Yan, third-class criminals, were accused of colluding to rob Yuyuan Oil Mill in Dacheng Town and Wu Gongchong and other families in Beixiang. The county government sent police to capture Yao and Yan one after another. They confessed to their crimes during the interrogation. Upon receiving a telegram from the provincial government approving the death penalty, County Chief Shen took the two prisoners to the execution ground yesterday morning (the 31st) at 8:00 a.m. and executed them by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Completion of the Xitang Town Watchtower: Xitang Town is one of the four major towns in Shan County. Commerce is flourishing, and bandits are always thinking of looting. Therefore, the local gentry and merchants are doing their utmost to protect the local area. In particular, they raised a large sum of money to build a watchtower. It is six stories high, and when viewed from the tower, everything within dozens of miles can be seen at a glance. A warning bell is installed on the tower. If there is a bandit alert, it will be immediately reported to prepare for defense. The tower was completed the day before yesterday. The construction cost was approximately over four thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Arrest of Impersonators: Two people wearing gray cotton military overcoats came to the Fuchang Restaurant on Xiyan Bridge on North Street in Jiaxing the night before last. They forced the use of a five-yuan counterfeit banknote from a certain bank. He Baoshun, a waiter at the restaurant, reported to the security team on patrol. The team members went inside to question them. They claimed to be Chen Changgen (one of them had already escaped in the meantime). After checking their symbols, the name was Yan Guowang, but there was no seal. A license was also found, as well as a piece of counterfeit money. After inquiring, it was learned that they were living in the Jiafa Inn in Dongmen. They were immediately arrested at the address. The one who had escaped was arrested on the spot. Another cotton military overcoat was also found. After inquiring, it was determined that they were not in the military, so they were clearly impersonating military personnel. Yesterday, they were sent to the joint military and police investigation office for verification. In addition, the Seventh Regiment, Second Battalion of the Wo Security Team also arrested a soldier impersonator, Zhou Debiao, yesterday. He was punished by the regiment and the county Public Security Bureau according to the law.</p>
<p>Change of Commander of the Merchant-Run Anti-Smuggling Camp: Lu Diankui, the commander of the Merchant-Run Anti-Smuggling Camp in Jiaxing, has been approved to resign. The Anti-Smuggling Bureau has appointed Chi Yueqiao to succeed him. After being appointed, Commander Chi came to He the day before yesterday to inspect the Nan Yan camp headquarters.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Engage in Fierce Battle with Villagers, Abandon Hostage and Flee: Zhang Genfu, a farmer in Dongzhuang Village outside the Xiaodongmen in Changxing, Huzhou, is a man of modest wealth, which made him the target of bandits. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, at around 9:00 p.m., eight or nine bandits suddenly came with guns, knives, and clubs, broke into the house, ransacked it, and kidnapped Genfu's granddaughter and fled south. When the bandits were passing by the Yokohamato area, they were spotted by the village's self-defense corps, who immediately opened fire and sounded the alarm. Villagers gathered at once, and the bandits also opened fire to resist. After fighting for about half an hour, the bandits could not hold out and retreated towards Dongzhuang Village, abandoning the hostage at the Dongzhuang Bridge. The bandits then scattered and fled. The hostage was taken back by Genfu.</p>
<p>Rice Boat Robbed En Route: Jin and Wang, farmers from Dipu Town on the border of An and Xiao in Huzhou, hired a boat to transport over a hundred dan of rice to Hangzhou for sale. The day before yesterday, when the rice boat was passing near Xiaoxikou, two bandit boats suddenly came. Dozens of bandits, armed with guns, stopped the boat. The bandits boarded the boat, tied up the boatmen, and arbitrarily moved the rice to the bandit boat until it was full. The bandits then sped away. Afterwards, the boatmen returned to Di and reported the robbery. It is now said that Jin and Wang are planning to report to the authorities to pursue the bandits.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Remittance of Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Taxes to the Ministry: After the establishment of the Zhejiang Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Director Wu Qiding has been working hard to rectify the various taxes. In addition to assigning the collection of license taxes to each bureau, he has also sent personnel to strictly review the brewing tank quotas in each district this year. The remittance of funds from each branch has been improving daily. As the end of January has arrived, the bureau urgently needs funds for the central government. It has specially prepared a document remitting 200,000 silver dollars in taxes for the entire month of March and the first ten days of April.</p>
<p>All Inland Water Merchant Ships Transferred to Zhejiang: Since the Zhejiang Department of Construction changed the director of the Provincial Merchants' Inland Water Steamship Bureau Office to Shi Zhaoji, the ships and routes of the entire bureau have now been redistributed and transferred to the province. It is now stipulated that 21 ships will operate in western Zhejiang and 21 ships will operate in eastern Zhejiang to facilitate merchants. The allocation is currently underway and will be announced and implemented after it is approved by the Department of Construction.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Robbery and Kidnapping Case in Zhujiazhai: On the night of the 29th, the house of Zhu Dashun in Xiaozhujiazhai outside the Southeast Gate of Xiaoshan was broken into by more than 20 bandits armed with guns and sharp weapons. They ransacked the house and kidnapped Dashun's brother Xiaoshun and fled south. Li Head Accused of Unauthorized Borrowing: Xu Jiexian, the Li Head of the Third Li in Xiaoshan County, was elected as the town head of Hebei Town, but the election has not yet been finalized. The county government has ordered the election to be suspended. The Li Head has been borrowing money from wealthy merchants and businesses in the name of preparing funds for the township government. The amounts borrowed are between one hundred and two hundred and fifty yuan. The local people believe that since the establishment of the township government has been suspended by order of the province, the borrowing should not be possible. The amount borrowed has now become huge, and they have filed a complaint with the county government to recover the funds.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from Yao Pengnian, Director of the Nantong Construction Bureau</h3>
<p>I recently read in the local correspondence column of your February 1st newspaper that Yao Pengnian, Director of the Nantong Construction Bureau, embezzled funds for the Yuejiang Road and the vehicle tax, and that the Department of Construction commissioned an investigation and dismissed Yao from his post and detained him in the province pending investigation of the accounts. I was shocked to read this. I have never embezzled funds for the Yuejiang Road or the vehicle tax, nor have I been dismissed from my post or detained in the province by the Department of Construction. I respectfully request that you make a correction. Sincerely, Yao Pengnian, Director of the Nantong Construction Bureau</p>

<p>Education News Highlights</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Education Administration Conference</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held on February 1st</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Last year, He Siyuan, Director of the Department of Education, convened the principals and teachers of all provincial middle schools and normal schools in the province to hold an education administration conference to discuss the reform matters for the year. This year, the case will continue to be held, and it is scheduled to open tomorrow (February 1st) at 10:00 a.m. at the No. 1 Women's Normal School on Quansheng Street in Jinan. The next day, the formal meeting will be held, and the meeting will last for up to one week. The most important proposal of this conference is the issue of the education funding budget for the 20th year submitted by the Department of Education. It is rumored that the education funding for the 20th year is planned to increase by 200,000 yuan (the budget for the 19th year was 2.2 million yuan) to 2.4 million yuan for the whole year. It is expected that this case can be fully passed. The difference between this conference and last year is that last year, the principals, academic directors, and training directors of each school were required to attend, while this year, only the principals of each school and conference staff are limited to attend. He Siyuan, Director of the Department of Education, is the natural chairman of the conference, and the presidium temporarily appointed each principal. They have now arrived. The names of the members are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>High School Principal Zhang Dunxu, First Normal School Principal Cai Zisheng, Second Normal School Principal Zhang Yuguang, Third Normal School Principal Zhou Chao, Fourth Normal School Principal Xu Yiqian, Fifth Normal School Principal Qi Hongzhao, First Women's Normal School Principal Wang Baolian, First Rural Normal School Principal Ju Chengying, Second Rural Normal School Principal Dong Fengchen, Third Rural Normal School Principal Cao Lanzhen, First Middle School Principal Sun Wei, Second Middle School Principal Sun Yuxi, Third Middle School Principal Li Taihua, Fourth Middle School Principal Feng Peiyuan, Fifth Middle School Principal Xu Meisheng, Sixth Middle School Principal Liu Shutao, Seventh Middle School Principal Wang Mianmin, Eighth Middle School Principal Yu Guoyuan, Ninth Middle School Principal Zhu Wenhui, Tenth Middle School Principal Zhu Yuxiao, Eleventh Middle School Principal Zhang Yuanheng, Twelfth Middle School Principal Li Zhenzhong, First Women's Middle School Principal Su Jizhou, First Vocational School Principal Meng Xianyun, Second Vocational School Principal Zhu Jingtang, Third Vocational School Principal Wang Chaodong, First Experimental Elementary School Principal Chen Jianheng, Second Experimental Elementary School Principal Liu Kunshan, Director of the Public Education Center Yang Chengrong, Department of Education Secretary Wang Jinxin, Wang Ye, Liu Cixiao, Section Chiefs Wu Weijun, Lai Zhizhong, Pi Songyun, Supervisors Ma Rumei, Dong Gan, Yang Shutian, Peng Rulin, 指遵員李蕃, Zhou Yan, 兌孫寳賢, Wang Xuxing, Zhang Jiyao, Section Staff Kong Detong, Liu Zengguan, Ji Luxiang, Yang Peng, Wang Zanlun, Director of the Compulsory Education Committee Kong Lingcan, Staff of the Audit Education Committee Guo Xijiu, Conference Secretaries Yang Peng, Liu Zengguan</p>
<h3>Hunan Education Director He Jian Telegraphs Huang Shiheng to Return to Post</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Huang Shiheng, member of the Hunan Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Education, left the province after the communists captured Changsha on July 27th of last year and has been residing in Shanghai ever since. He has not yet returned to the province, and the department's affairs have been temporarily handled by Yu Shaojiao, the first section chief, for half a year. Huang has repeatedly requested to resign, but has been comforted and retained. He Jian had previously requested the Central Committee to reorganize the provincial government in October of last year, with Tan Changkai serving as a member of the provincial government and Director of the Department of Education. However, the education community was dissatisfied with Tan's personal qualities and rose up in opposition. Although repeated efforts were made to resolve the matter, no results were achieved. The case of the partial reorganization of the provincial government was thus shelved. The Hunan education community has repeatedly requested the Central Committee to either urge Director Huang to return to Hunan or appoint someone with a good reputation to succeed him, but no one has been approved to take charge of the Department of Education. Until recently when He Jian went to Lushan to visit Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, he met Zhou Fohai (Zhou is from Yuanling, Hunan Province) and asked Zhou to return to Hunan to succeed as the Director of Education. Zhou initially agreed to consider it and then decide. Recently, Zhou made it clear that he would not take the post. On the other hand, many parties believe that the situation in the education community in Hunan is complicated and still request Huang to return to Hunan to take charge. To accommodate the opinions of all parties, He Jian decided not to replace him and telegraphed Huang to return to Hunan to take charge of the department's affairs. The telegram read: "To Director Huang Jianping of Shanghai, The Hunan situation is gradually stabilizing, and education is the foundation of construction. Many things need to be done. I hope you will return to Hunan soon to take charge of the department and rectify any shortcomings. He Jian." It is unknown whether Huang will return or not.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Strictly Orders Anhui University to Rectify School Spirit</h3>
<p>Expulsion of Five Students</p>
<p>Since Yang Lianggong took over as president of Anhui University, he has hired well-known professors, and the relationship between teachers and students is extremely harmonious. For half a year, the sound of chanting has been harmonious. Before the New Year's holiday, to take care of students from afar, the administrative meeting decided to announce nine rules for students staying at school during the New Year's holiday and reported to the provincial government for approval to allow students from afar to stay at school to avoid their hardships. During the holiday, about a hundred people stayed at school and were able to abide by the rules. However, students Wu Zhaoshu, Luo Xi, Chen Yunxi, Zhang Qin, and Ni Jiafa repeatedly violated school rules and recently even gathered privately at night. The school's dormitory group repeatedly advised them to stop, but they refused to obey. The school took this action after receiving clear orders from the provincial government and the central government to strictly rectify the school spirit, and because these students' usual behavior was deliberately violating school rules and was difficult to cultivate, it convened the ninth administrative meeting on January 30th and expelled them in accordance with the ninth rule of the student rules for staying at school during the New Year's holiday. The school has reported the details of this matter to the provincial government.</p>
<h3>Local News: Major Change in the Student Movement at China Public School Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ma Junwu Flees in Haste</p>
<p>Six Directors Resign Simultaneously</p>
<p>Rumor Says the Dispute is Soon to End</p>
<p>The student movement at the National China Public School has been ongoing for three months without resolution. Yesterday, there was a sudden change: Ma Junwu hurriedly left the school. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Faculty and Staff Strongly Oppose Ma: The faculty and staff committee of China Public School, seeing the increasing scale of the unrest, which was not beneficial to the school, submitted a letter to the board of directors yesterday. The original letter stated: "To the esteemed members of the board of directors, since Principal Hu took over the school in May of the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928], the number of students has more than doubled in two years, and the school's social reputation has gradually improved. Last summer, when Mr. Hu went abroad to lecture, he proposed his resignation, and your council recommended Mr. Ma Junwu to succeed him. At the beginning of his tenure, we had high expectations. However, Mr. Ma has been in charge for less than a year, and there have been many inappropriate measures in terms of school management. We respectfully present the most important of these to your council: 1. According to the school's charter and the council's regulations, the council is the highest legislative body within the school. All important administrative matters must be approved by the council to be valid. Since Mr. Ma has been in charge, the council has not been convened even once. For important matters such as changes to the academic system (such as changing the Department of Literature and History to Departments of Literature, History, Geography, Education, and Philosophy, as well as the construction of buildings, etc.), he has acted arbitrarily and dictatorially. 2. The school's accounting has always been open (with monthly account reports published). Since Mr. Ma has been in charge, there has not been a single report. 3. According to the Ministry of Education's order prohibiting Zhejiang University from forging diplomas, new student certificates are routinely sent to the original schools for verification. In the first semester, the investigation revealed 48 forged diplomas, which Mr. Ma announced would be expelled. However, Mr. Ma then reinstated the enrollment of 10 students. For students with forged diplomas who have already registered for this semester, he has instructed that the investigation be temporarily suspended at the beginning of the semester. 4. According to regulations, auditors do not need to undergo examinations, and the number of auditors admitted has always been strictly limited. Mr. Ma has repeatedly sent letters to the academic affairs office, urging them to make accommodations. Almost two months after the start of the semester, the admission of auditors has not yet been finalized. As a result, the number of auditors this semester has reached as many as 176, greatly affecting the progress of academic affairs. 5. After the outbreak of the unrest, Mr. Ma fled in haste. Fortunately, all colleagues worked hard and diligently to maintain the school's operations and prevent them from stopping. After your council resolved to approve Mr. Ma's resignation and recommend Mr. Yu Youren to succeed him, Mr. Ma returned to the school, and the student delegation took the opportunity to emerge, so your council's resolution of October 30 has not yet been implemented. Mr. Ma treats the delegation as an emperor and looks to them for guidance in everything, so the students in the delegation control everything in the school. 6. Professor Luo Longji and others were explicitly ordered by the Ministry of Education to withdraw from Guanghua University. However, Mr. Ma regards them as confidants and recruits their Guanghua cronies to high positions, treating the Ministry of Education's orders as mere formalities. Considering the above, it is difficult to acquit Mr. Ma of mismanagement in school management. Now, the Executive Yuan has issued an order to investigate the school, and the school's foundation is becoming increasingly unstable. We, the colleagues, are deeply alarmed by this situation. In addition to passing a resolution to send representatives to earnestly request your council to implement the resolution of October 30 as soon as possible, we also truthfully report the situation, hoping for your review and implementation. Then, China Public School will be fortunate. Sincerely, the Faculty and Staff Committee of China Public School. January 29."</p>
<p>Ma Junwu Reluctant to Leave: The entire faculty and staff have expressed serious dissatisfaction with Ma Junwu, and the Ministry of Education has also sent three special commissioners, Zhu Zimian, He Xisheng, and Guo Zijie, to investigate the matter. It is reported that conclusive evidence has been found. Directors Wang Yunwu and Liu Nanhai are deeply concerned that the school's foundation will be shaken as a result. They came forward to mediate yesterday (January 31) and planned to invite Chairman Cai Yuanpei to serve as acting principal, hoping to facilitate Ma's departure. However, Ma insisted on his own way and even proposed five conditions for negotiation, including "not replacing Luo Longji" and "appointing Dong Renjian as Dean of Academic Affairs." As a result, Mr. Cai, for the sake of the life of China Public School and the students' studies, except for Luo Longji and others who were explicitly ordered by the Ministry of Education to withdraw from Guanghua University and could not be employed, also agreed to one or two of his conditions. The handover was scheduled for the morning of the day before yesterday (February 1). Unexpectedly, Ma Junwu suddenly sent a quick letter to Directors Wang and Liu that afternoon, expressing his regret. It is reported that the letter contained words such as "fearing that the students (referring to the so-called delegation who are willing to be used for personal gain) will still use the means of dealing with Mr. Ma to deal with Mr. Cai." His blatant reluctance to leave and attempt to control the situation has reached this point.</p>
<p>Performing a Violent Drama, Arousing Public Outrage: Ma Junwu, seeing the recent situation, knew that the situation was unfavorable to him and planned to make a desperate gamble. Yesterday morning, he had Luo Longji and others lead the student delegation to violently beat up classmates and carry out large-scale destruction, arousing public outrage among all the students. After the self-defense conflict, Ma Junwu fled the school in haste. The students then temporarily sealed off the various offices and waited for the board of directors to send personnel to take over. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau of the 7th District of Wusong and the garrison headquarters have jointly dispatched military police to maintain order.</p>
<p>Another report: Since Principal Ma Junwu of China Public School convened a meeting of faculty and staff the day before yesterday, all matters could have proceeded step by step. Unexpectedly, a small number of Tongmenghui members, seeing that the school was becoming increasingly stable and unable to achieve their goal of destroying China Public School, shouted and gathered twenty or thirty people, carrying weapons, and swarmed into China Public School, smashing all the public equipment in the school's offices. At the same time, they used various methods to provoke students who love the school, intending to cause disputes and create a climate of terror. It is reported that this matter was planned long ago and that a certain secretary of the board of directors directed it from within. Fortunately, the majority of the school's students maintained calm, and Battalion Commander Xiong worked hard to maintain order, so no disaster occurred. Later, Principal Ma of the school personally went to the school to explain, and the dispute was resolved.</p>
<p>Another report: At 6:00 PM on February 2, the board of directors of China Public School held a temporary meeting at the Cangzhou Hotel. Nine people attended the meeting and resolved to accept the letters of resignation from Chairman Cai Yuanpei, as well as directors Wang Yunwu, Liu Nanhai, Gao Yihan, Yang Xingfo, and Ding Yinyin.</p>
<h3>The First Issue of the People's Daily Has Been Published</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, in view of the importance of promoting mass education, hired experts Chen Duanzhi and others to edit the People's Daily, hoping to disseminate it widely. The first issue was published on the first day of the month. The content includes Chen Duanzhi's opening remarks, explaining the purpose of the publication, a chronicle of major events, Qian Xuanqing's reading and literacy content covering both positive and negative aspects that are essential for general knowledge, as well as simple and easy-to-understand content such as insults, refuting superstition, and classic jokes. Therefore, it is said that many citizens welcome it.</p>
<h3>The English-Chinese Model Dictionary, 20th Edition, is Published</h3>

The 20th edition has already begun to be sold. Coinciding with the start of the spring semester for various schools, buyers are extremely enthusiastic, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shen Yu’s Grammar of Japanese, Reprinted</h3>
<p>The book Grammar of Japanese, written by Professor Shen Yuguang of the Southeast Medical College, has novel material and is well-organized. When it was published last year, it was introduced by this newspaper once, and the first edition sold out in a few days. Recently, due to numerous orders from people in various provinces and the approaching start of the school semester, it has been reprinted. Those who are studying Japanese on their own but lack a suitable textbook, or schools that are teaching Japanese but have not found a suitable textbook, can purchase it in advance to avoid regret. Contact: Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, Dajilu, West Gate, this city. The author's price is one silver dollar, it is said.</p>

<h3>Interview with Hao Gengsheng, Director of Physical Education at Northeastern University</h3>
<p>Northeast Sports Are Full of Vigor</p>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, Master of Arts and Director of Physical Education at Northeastern University, along with Mr. Song Junfu, led the basketball team south this time. The team fought nine times in Beijing and Shanghai, winning eight and losing one, showing great promise. After the competition in Beijing and Shanghai, they returned north with Mr. Song. Mr. Hao arrived in Shanghai yesterday and took a steamer to Nantong that night. Two weeks later, he will return to school with his wife, Ms. Gao Zi. Before leaving Shanghai yesterday, he spoke with reporters for an hour. Mr. Hao is a leading figure in the sports community in the Northeast. His great insights are worth revealing, so the most important of them are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Success of the Basketball Team</p>
<p>The astonishing performance of the basketball team this time was beyond expectations. What I (Mr. Hao refers to himself) am most pleased with is the team's high morale and sound sportsmanship. The team's success in the south lies in this and not in anything else. The highest goal of sports is not to be concerned with winning or losing, but to be based on spirit and morality. Those of us who are responsible for promoting sports will take this as the standard.</p>
<h3>The Current Status of the Sino-Belgian Games</h3>
<p>On my way back to school, I will go to Jinan for a detailed discussion with the local sports community, because the track and field events of the Sino-Belgian Games are planned to be held there. The record events will be held in Peiping [Beijing] during the summer vacation to avoid disrupting studies. The northern provinces are now actively preparing, and good results will be produced at that time.</p>
<h3>The Future of Northeast Sports</h3>
<p>The Northeast authorities are enthusiastic about sports and spare no effort. Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang is especially able to lead everything by setting an example himself. In the near future, Northeast sports will occupy an important position in the country. The Department of Physical Education of Northeastern University specializes in training physical education coaches, which is a major plan for the long-term foundation. It is currently being expanded. The gymnasium and sports field will begin construction soon. Other important tasks related to the promotion of sports are also planned with concrete plans, which will be gradually implemented as soon as the funds are raised. The development of Northeast sports is not far away.</p>
<h3>Tsinghua Wins the Championship in This Year's Five Universities Football Tournament</h3>
<p>Beijing, 2nd telegram: The championship of this year's Five Universities Football Tournament was publicly awarded yesterday to Tsinghua.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Basketball Game That Caused a Sensation in the Capital: Northeastern University Defeats Central University</h3>
<p>Score: 53 to 24</p>
<p>Is the Central University Team Yielding and Humble?</p>
<p>The Northeastern University basketball team left Shanghai and came to Beijing. They won against Jinling [University] in one battle. The results were not very good only because the Jinling venue was too slippery and the light was insufficient. At 7:30 PM one evening, they met the Central University team again at the Central University gymnasium. Northeastern University showed its true colors and defeated them with a score of 53 to 24. Du Tingxiu was the referee. The progress of the game is as follows:</p>
<h3>Northeastern University's Fame Shakes the Capital</h3>
<p>After Northeastern University defeated Jinling, the entire capital was in an uproar. Everyone wanted to see the Northeastern athletes. Knowing that Central University's basketball skills were not as good as Jinling's, and knowing that they would definitely lose, they only wanted to appreciate the wonderful performance of Northeastern University. Therefore, the spectators still rushed to be the first to enter. And because that day was a Sunday, the Central University gymnasium was declared full before 7:00 PM. How magnificent!</p>
<h3>Central University Can Do Nothing But Sigh</h3>
<p>With the sound of the whistle, the fierce battle began. After a few rounds of maneuvering, Yuan Tingrui of Northeastern University took the lead and scored a goal. As soon as one ball went in, another fell into the net. Ma Bingjun defended the rear, and Zhao Lingzhi also announced success. The speed of the attack amazed the entire audience. Although Central University was determined to resist the enemy, they had no way to defend themselves and could only sigh helplessly. The Central University left guard, Wang Fuchen, was a strong player, but unfortunately, he committed four fouls and was sent off. Central University was even more unable to maintain the situation. The result of the first half was 31 to 11, with Northeastern University winning.</p>
<h3>Re-engaging in Battle, Deploying Generals and Sending Soldiers</h3>
<p>Northeastern University knew that Central University was far from being its opponent, so it slightly changed its lineup in the second half. Right forward Tian Xinyuan was replaced by Chuan Baochun, and left guard Pang Ying was replaced by Shi Wanhai. Central University also changed Luo Chengzhong to right guard. New soldiers and new generals each showed their skills. Northeastern University, relying on its infinitely changing tactics, was still as powerful as splitting bamboo. The Central University right forward, Xu Rukang, was a standout player, but he was alone and helpless, so his strength was in vain. The result of the second half was 22 to 13, for a total of 53 to 24.</p>
<h3>The Host Meets the Guest with Humility</h3>
<p>Central University's basketball skills are far behind Northeastern University's. They were too slow to start and slow to pass the ball. They were also not eager to grab the ball, resulting in repeated missed opportunities in front of the enemy. On the other hand, Northeastern University cannot be compared to them. Some say that Central University is the host and Northeastern University is the guest, so it is appropriate for Central University to yield to the guest. Is that really the case?</p>
<p>Northeastern University vs. Central University</p>
<p>Name and Position | Score | Name and Position | Score</p>
<p>Right Forward Yuan Tingrui | 24 | Right Forward Xu Rukang | 8</p>
<p>Left Forward Tian Xinyuan | 4 | Left Forward Zhong Jiqing | 4</p>
<p>Left Forward Chuan Baochun | 2 | Center Xu | 4</p>
<p>Center Zhao Lingzhong | 18 | Right Guard Zhu Shouxun | 0</p>
<p>Right Guard Ma Bingjun | 1 | Right Guard Luo Chengzhong | 0</p>
<p>Left Guard Pang Ying | 4 | Left Guard Wang Fuchen | 6</p>
<p>Left Guard Shi Wanhai | 0 | Left Guard Zhang Zhen | 2</p>
<p>First Half: Northeastern University 31 points, Central University 11 points</p>
<p>Second Half: Northeastern University 22 points, Central University 13 points</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Java Invite Japanese Football Team</h3>
<p>Intending to Avenge the Shame of the Far East</p>
<p>And Plan to Participate in the World Games</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Java have made great progress in sports, and football is especially developed. Last year, in view of the shame of the Far East, they rose up to draw their swords. Therefore, the Java Overseas Chinese Youth Association initiated the invitation of a Japanese football team to Java to compete and determine the strength of the two countries, so that Japan knows that our country still has strong teams, not just Lehua and South China. According to reports, the strength of the Overseas Chinese United Team in various ports of Java is extremely strong, far surpassing the famous teams in the country. Because Lehua failed several times in that area during its southern expedition, the motivation for this recruitment of the Japanese football team is not only to avenge the shame of the Far East, but also to prepare to participate in the World Games. The overseas Chinese have such a heroic act, which is truly admirable. As for contacting Japan to come to Java for the competition, it was entrusted to a Westerner, Mr. Riem, to negotiate with the Japan Football Association. Japan has already agreed. According to the hope of the Overseas Chinese Youth Association, it is hoped that Japan will send the same athletes as last year's Far East Games to Java and make large-scale competitions in various ports of Java during the summer vacation, two games per week. All expenses will be borne by the Overseas Chinese side. The Japan Football Association is currently discussing the method of selecting players. According to Mr. Yin, the director of the Association, "Since the Japanese football team fought with China in the Far East last year, its strength has been evident in the East Asian countries. It is an honor to be invited by the Overseas Chinese in Java who have come admiringly. However, it may be difficult to gather the representatives from last year's Far East Games, but Japan will definitely select a strong team from the universities to go to Java to fight."</p>

<h3>The National Assembly's Auditorium</h3>
<p>- Jie Fei</p>
<p>The National Assembly is scheduled to convene in the capital on May 5th of this year, which is the only major internal affairs event of the year. The convening date is only a hundred days away, and election matters are already being planned. The venue for the meeting should be chosen as a magnificent and spacious auditorium. At the beginning of the capital's construction, the only one that can be used for this grand event is the Central University Auditorium, which is currently under construction.</p>
<p>The Central University Auditorium was prepared, managed, and planned by the former president, Zhang Naiyan, over a period of two years. Construction began in March of last spring. The architectural engineers, Dai Botuo and Bao Luo, based on Zhang's intentions, drew up plans and descriptions, which were approved by the Auditorium Construction Committee. The bidding process was taken and the Xinjinji Kang Company won the bid to build the auditorium. The main body of the construction requires 480,000 yuan. As of today, only 170,000 yuan has been paid, which is a huge difference. If construction is stopped midway, it would not be appropriate. Now, President Zhu Jiahua has suggested to Chairman Chiang of the National Government that the auditorium of the school be used as the meeting place for the National Assembly and requested a subsidy of 200,000 yuan to roughly complete the construction by April 15th. This proposal has been approved by Chairman Chiang, so recently the sounds of workers hammering and chiseling have never stopped throughout the night.</p>
<h3>Welcoming the Autumn Melody - Admiring Clouds Tower Master</h3>
<p>For the Newly Radiant Miss Yanqiu</p>
<p>In the theater, they said, the essence of Beijing favored artists.</p>
<p>Envy filled Jiangnan, blessed with abundant delights for the eyes.</p>
<p>After viewing autumn flowers, then came plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Plum blossoms surpassed all fragrant kingdoms.</p>
<p>Autumn flowers naturally uttered their colors.</p>
<p>Colors and fragrance all followed the north wind.</p>
<p>From then on, the sounds of the zither were sought but unattainable.</p>
<p>Precisely when winter was waning and the year was ending,</p>
<p>She propped up the precarious situation with her spirit.</p>
<p>The clever mistress of the stage devised a brilliant plan.</p>
<p>Ultimately, she relied on the beauty of a woman to rally the masses.</p>
<p>At the head of the Huangpu River, she waved the flag and drummed.</p>
<p>On the red carpet, one listened to singing and dancing.</p>
<p>Excluding male actors, she chose female actors.</p>
<p>She must be a well-rounded talent, proficient in both literature and martial arts.</p>
<p>Only then did she think of offering gifts to recruit Xue Yanqin.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Lang, skilled in appreciating music, could not be satisfied.</p>
<p>Afflicted with illness, he was unable to continue writing snow odes.</p>
<p>She changed the strings and composed an autumn poem.</p>
<p>Her singing voice and emotions were both unparalleled.</p>
<p>Her steps afterwards rivaled the Cheng Men style, not to be surpassed.</p>
<p>If not for Teng Lu's illness in bed,</p>
<p>How could she have obtained the jade beauty from the sea?</p>
<p>Everywhere on the sea, the sounds were of autumn.</p>
<p>The new oriole's delicate warbling pierced through beads.</p>
<p>Playing together, they performed an unmatched skill.</p>
<p>Now, she is hailed as the number one writer, relying on her talent.</p>
<p>For a time, the three heroes were fully prepared.</p>
<p>Even more, she displayed the delicate eyebrows' signature performance.</p>
<p>Lianxi broke the rules and presented flower baskets (referring to Zhou Meiquan).</p>
<p>Yuanlong saw the hunt and reserved a seat (referring to Chen Yong'an, the Minister).</p>
<p>Her pupils were as clear as cut water jade.</p>
<p>Their skirts fluttered as they greeted her with smiles.</p>
<p>Those with eyes naturally knew the mistress who gathered verdure.</p>
<p>Everyone praised the name of Yu Hua.</p>
<p>Yu Hua's integrity and purity were passed down through her family.</p>
<p>In the year of Wuchen, she went south at the age of seventeen.</p>
<p>She also sang "Backyard Flower,"</p>
<p>Her fame soared, reminiscent of sweet osmanthus.</p>
<p>After three years of absence, she was happy to meet her again.</p>
<p>In the painting of hairpin ornaments, one recognized her jade-like countenance.</p>
<p>Beneath the plum trees, new peaches and plums were planted.</p>
<p>Beside the chrysanthemums, beautiful lotuses emerged.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was originally the Golden Chestnut,</p>
<p>Wanting to form a tripod with Mei and Cheng.</p>
<p>Where her heart blossomed, her writing blossomed.</p>
<p>Fan Shan would surely continue painting orchids.</p>
<p>The sea's melody was sending back the sounds of autumn.</p>
<p>The river's water competed to welcome the colors of autumn.</p>
<p>Autumn arrived in Jiangnan, boasting two beauties.</p>
<p>Look at me, carrying praise, returning to Yan Terrace.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of this auditorium, its framework has recently been fully established, reaching an extremely towering and majestic state. Former Principal Zhang Naiyan wrote an article titled "The Grand Auditorium of National Central University" in the ninth semi-monthly publication of the university, in which he explained, "The grand auditorium is built in the very center of Dazhong Road," facing the main gate. The science hall is located to its left, and the engineering hall, planned for future construction, will be located to its right. In front of the science hall is the biology hall, and in front of the engineering hall is the library. These five buildings stand side by side, with the grand auditorium in the center, forming a constellation of stars surrounding the pole star. In front of the grand auditorium, a circular road is formed, in the middle of which a bronze statue of the President is planned to be erected to express a solemn and great atmosphere and to serve as a model for the people of the country.</p>
<p>The grand auditorium has an octagonal structure, modeled after a theater, with a front porch at the front, a lecture platform at the back, and offices on both sides. From its exterior, the front porch has Ionic columns and a triangular top, and the grand auditorium has a European Renaissance-style dome, all harmonizing with the surrounding buildings. The entire area of the grand auditorium is 25,700 square feet, and its height from the ground to the tip of the dome is 104 feet, making it the main building among all the buildings.</p>
<p>The entire grand auditorium is divided into three levels: upper, middle, and lower. The lower level has a front porch that is 47 feet wide and 21 feet long, with stairs, cloakrooms, and restrooms on both sides. The grand auditorium is 91 feet in diameter and 54 feet high, with a total of 1,330 seats. The lecture platform is 70 feet wide and 24 feet long, taking the form of a theater stage, with eight rooms on both sides that can be used as dressing rooms. In front of the lower level, rooms are opened for the needs of the orchestra. The middle level has boxes and a reception room, with a total of 714 seats in the boxes and a reception room area of 1,034 square feet. The upper level has boxes, a conference room, and a projection room, with a total of 656 seats in the boxes, a conference room area of 520 square feet, and a projection room area of 260 square feet. The three levels together have a total of 2,700 seats. In terms of the area of the front part of the grand auditorium and the number of seats, it is the largest auditorium in China today, and also the largest theater in China today.</p>
<p>We can imagine that on the day the grand building is completed, talented and wise people from all over the country will gather to discuss national affairs, and the new impressions and glory recorded in history will be significant and worthy of special mention.</p>
<h3>### Record of Peeking from the Red Gate</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>"Behind red gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the roads, lie frozen corpses." This is an old saying. However, the "red gate" I write about refers to the residence of my friend, Mr. Zhu Huitang, and not to the mansion of a wealthy noble. Huitang, also known as the Master of Yangxin Cottage, once studied under the renowned scholar Xu Zhiyan, and is also skilled in writing, speaking like a novelist. Novelist's words cannot provide for all needs, and engaging in trade is not beneficial. Therefore, he still relies on his bald pen to make a living by selling articles. His poverty and lack of savings are evident. He has been living in the Jingxing Lane on North Henan Road for more than ten years as a subtenant. Recently, a friend from Suzhou entrusted him with two hundred gold coins to buy camel down and high-quality mink. Unexpectedly, this small sum aroused the greed of bandits, who carried out a robbery on a night of heavy wind and snow. Huitang has a young child, just learning to walk. The bandits mistakenly thought that they could get a ransom by kidnapping the child. However, the child could not keep silent and cried out in fear. The bandits, realizing that they had no chance of success, abandoned the child in the Yuegong Inn in Shiliupu. The innkeeper reported it to the police, and the child was safely returned. It was indeed a narrow escape. Last autumn, I lived in the Xiexing Lane in North Shanghai and was robbed. Now, Huitang has also heard of being targeted by thieves. Why is it that the economy is so bad, but thieves particularly like to visit the homes of poor scholars? Huitang is addicted to books and paintings. Whenever he has extra money, he uses it to collect calligraphy and paintings by contemporary celebrities. He especially loves the works of Su Shi from the Song Dynasty. Fortunately, the thieves did not understand art appreciation; otherwise, his collection might have been lost. Huitang studied under Zhiyan, who was a skilled calligrapher. He has a large collection of his teacher's works, and some people have offered to buy them with money, saying, "These are mementos of my teacher. How can I casually give them away?" The way of the teacher is declining, but Huitang alone is able to respectfully remember his teacher in this way. He is truly a sincere and generous person.</p>
<h3>### Eulogy for Dr. Yu Fengbin</h3>
<p>— Yu Fengshao</p>
<p>Alas, Fengbin! The nation's model,</p>
<p>A scholar who extinguished learning, a doctor who saved lives.</p>
<p>Called an "Advanced" one, he explored the secrets of the Golden Cabinet.</p>
<p>A covered cup, he cut off illnesses; people's sicknesses seemed gone.</p>
<p>He went back and forth without stinting, truly harmonious and cautiously careful.</p>
<p>A superior doctor prevents disease, especially promoting health.</p>
<p>I worried about gathering firewood; my bones stood out, towering and craggy.</p>
<p>You saw my illness and came several times a day,</p>
<p>Expounding and nurturing, chopping and capturing the demons of illness.</p>
<p>You instructed me to take good care of myself, to conserve labor.</p>
<p>Drinking sour yogurt, my intestines were clear and quiet.</p>
<p>For more than ten years, you taught me to keep to the path.</p>
<p>At fifty years old, I was still a beast of burden.</p>
<p>You indeed made me healthy, but you did not keep yourself well.</p>
<p>Neither ointment nor blindness took away my good friend.</p>
<p>When I first met you, you were a young man in night school.</p>
<p>Your upright posture made my heart melt.</p>
<p>German texts were beautifully taught, but the pronunciation was slightly off.</p>
<p>You scolded harshly with delicate anger.</p>
<p>I looked at you and laughed; you took my hand.</p>
<p>You addressed me by my name, and I addressed you as a brother.</p>
<p>Cao Zhi analyzed questions, difficult to go along with.</p>
<p>You did not want me to become an adult; you were also young.</p>
<p>At that time, our spirit swallowed the seas and scraped the skies.</p>
<p>I went to Wulin and occasionally lectured.</p>
<p>You roamed the holy lake; I welcomed you barefoot.</p>
<p>Weak younger brothers and sisters linked like jade mountains.</p>
<p>Then we climbed the Southern Mountain, gripping vines and tiger stones.</p>
<p>One whistle, and the world was at hand.</p>
<p>Composing poetry at length, the mountains were startled.</p>
<p>Even more, we two left traces like wild geese.</p>
<p>This scene is like yesterday, how long has it been?</p>
<p>We joined together in Shanghai, hiding and roaming, following each other.</p>
<p>You were strong, and I grew old; our temples turned to silk.</p>
<p>Your younger brother and sister shone brightly.</p>
<p>The brilliance of the literary world, the Kunpeng in the heavens and earth.</p>
<p>A family of talented and righteous people, full of complacency and hesitation.</p>
<p>Gathering at the Forest of Merit, we feasted on fresh wine.</p>
<p>Taking photos and writing inscriptions, everyone was happy and joyful.</p>
<p>This narrative is not complete; you passed away suddenly.</p>
<p>Remembering the old, I grieve for the wise, tears flowing.</p>
<p>You were not to live long, but your name has already been planned.</p>
<p>The world makes drafts; your lectures filled the podium.</p>
<p>Your tongue wore out; you recognized public health.</p>
<p>Scientific naming was thorough and meticulous.</p>
<p>Your compassionate heart for saving the world was ample.</p>
<p>You left behind the courage of your final effort.</p>
<p>With the last of your strength, you engaged in literature and art.</p>
<p>Showed me small poems, the phrases clear and beautiful.</p>
<p>Gathered your posthumous works, the spirit of ancient sages in harmony.</p>
<p>Engraving and describing the ancient righteousness move automatically.</p>
<p>Alas, you passed away due to overwork, advancing without resting.</p>
<p>In the year of Xinhai, the revolution was grand.</p>
<p>You also rose up, personally participating in the military ranks.</p>
<p>Healing illnesses with fierce loyalty, creating the cause.</p>
<p>Afterwards, you told me about your dangerous experiences.</p>
<p>At the foot of Mount Mu, the battle was fierce.</p>
<p>Cannonballs flew like buckets beside you.</p>
<p>Heaven was fortunate not to break the sun; your essence remained as usual.</p>
<p>You were benevolent and brave; who in the world can compare?</p>
<p>Only your passing is the nation's sorrow.</p>
<p>Who will proclaim the meaning of health?</p>
<p>Who will pick the essence of medicine?</p>
<p>The sick are distraught, as if they have lost their support.</p>
<p>Whether knowing or not, everyone is in grief and shock.</p>
<p>Shanghai is newly managed, seeking comprehensive preparation.</p>
<p>You participated in the construction, promoting grand discussions.</p>
<p>You suddenly passed away midway; who will support the city's governance?</p>
<p>Academic affairs and achievements, everything has been abandoned.</p>
<p>Alas, the nine sufferings of the sun, the nation's fortune is difficult.</p>
<p>The evil atmosphere is what is affected.</p>
<p>The treasure prompts the public's life to be shortened.</p>
<p>Reckless extravagance is created.</p>
<p>What the Creator has complete is thick and wise, cut off from heaven.</p>
<p>Those who are evident are long-lived, and those who are hidden are turned upside down.</p>
<p>Confused and chaotic, I do not know; the Emperor is drunk and wants to sleep.</p>
<p>Blessings and lewdness, disasters and goodness, neither close nor hated.</p>
<p>You know the Buddhist principles; you should understand the causes and conditions.</p>
<p>Completion and dwelling, ruin and emptiness, why bother to linger?</p>
<p>Although separated by heaven and man, the spirit is truly connected.</p>
<p>A fragrance of the heart, may you be present!</p>
<h3>### Twin Fortunes Tied with One Heart</h3>
<p>— Weibin</p>
<p>Mr. Ji, a talented man from Wuzhong, and Ms. Huang Fuji had a love affair that was so deep and entangled that they were able to overcome difficulties and win the battle of love in their struggle, and finally tied the knot. It was only a hair's breadth away from their love affair being overthrown and broken.</p>
<p>At the beginning of their love, they already had the regret of "I hate that we did not meet before she was married." Therefore, those who know the situation all said that there were hidden reefs and it would be difficult to achieve a satisfactory result. Moreover, those who are in love nowadays are just following the trend, using money and power to combine. In a dangerous world with fickle human emotions, the women were even more known for their shifting affections. Mr. Ji was a poor and helpless scholar. He had no real power to maintain the relationship. With nothing but a stomach full of books, how could he win the heart of a beauty forever?</p>
<p>Who knew that the two of them would hastily enter a dangerous relationship and try to stop at the edge of a cliff but fail to gather the strength to do so. Their hard work was nothing but a cocoon around themselves. The more they strengthened their love, the more bitter it tasted. Fortunately, both of them came from respectable families and deeply understood righteousness. Although they had experienced hardships, their pure hearts were determined and unwavering. Ms. Huang showed a chivalrous spirit. She resolutely took responsibility and blamed herself in court. Although Mr. Ji tasted the flavor of prison life, he was saved from being caught in the net of the law thanks to Ms. Huang's confession. Her chivalrous spirit was praised as the second Huang HuiRu.</p>
<p>Now that the difficulties have been resolved, the two fortunes are tied together. They have entered into an agreement to live together. Ms. Huang knew of Mr. Ji's poverty and abandoned the prosperity of the city. They built a cottage in the countryside and lived as husband and wife, worrying about firewood and rice. They were able to live a simple and frugal life, not inferior to the cloth skirt and thorn hairpin of ancient times.</p>
<h3>### Warmth in the Heart (362)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: The Technique of Preserving Youth: Emerald Green Camouflages Moth Eyebrows</p>
<p>Hopelessness in Extending Life: Golden Market for a Thoroughbred Horse’s Bones</p>
<p>It turned out that Hua Yuanchun was also a famous courtesan in Shanghai. She had a round face and a tall frame. Her nose was like a hanging gall bladder, and she was exceptionally born with a large nose. Ellis's article "The Relationship Between Smell and Sexual Beauty" also cited many legends from the sixteenth century about the relationship between large noses. He said that the olfactory organs and sexual organs have a close connection. Not only is the large nose of a man and his huge power an indelible theory in Chinese and Western physiognomy, but it is also said that women with long noses must have intense sexual impulses. We do not study physiognomy, nor do we need to talk about it. In short, Hua Yuanchun's nose was a unique feature among the famous flowers on the sea at that time, like Zhang Yangzhi's face, which was terribly red, and Hua Juanjuan's hair, which was endearingly messy, and also like someone's feet and someone's waist, all of which were famous. Hua Yuanchun was a romantic person. Her purpose in entertaining guests was not money. As long as she liked them in her heart, she would entertain them. Or if someone said a few nice words to praise her, she would think that person was a good person. Which young woman does not like handsome young men? However, those who work as prostitutes are wary of this, first because handsome young men are often unwilling to spend money and are disliked by the madams in general, and second because after having a handsome young man, they no longer like the old gentlemen. The old gentlemen are unwilling to spend money. Most prostitutes do not have the right to control their own bodies. If they are not controlled by others, they will be willful and do whatever they want, leading to an uncontrollable situation. In the past, the most reckless prostitutes in Shanghai were those who were infatuated with actors and horse drivers. There were indeed many handsome young actors, but they also liked their strong bodies, which had a kind of northern vigorous style. Among actors, those who played martial roles were the most popular. Hua Yuanchun was a person who was physically plump and vigorous, so she also liked that kind of athletic man, so she was infatuated with a martial actor named Gai Yutang. But she wasn't satisfied with just one man, and she also had a horse driver named Asen who she hooked up with. Although Asen was a driver, he was also very skilled. He even opened a carriage company himself. In addition to sedans and covered carriages for people to travel, there were also several Tingsmei carriages. He himself was the boss of a carriage company. Ordinary driving was done by the drivers, but if someone specifically asked Asen to drive himself, he would be very happy to do so. Asen's horse-pulling was fast and stable, and he was always quick-witted and dressed in narrow-sleeved, light-dressed silk and satin. In short, he was a brisk and agile driver. Several fashionable officials on the Shanghai beach had to ask Asen to drive himself when they took a carriage.</p>

<h3>### Gold Prices Trend Higher Again</h3>
<p>The market situation continued to be extremely volatile. Yesterday, February 2nd, the benchmark gold saw another high price trend, remaining extremely complex and unpredictable. Both the morning and afternoon markets had fluctuations of about ten taels. Throughout the day, there were a total of twenty-two taels of fluctuations. Looking back, the psychology of the industry was diverse. In the morning market, companies such as Hengxing, Yuancheng, Fengyong, Yuanmao, and Yongdeng all made purchases. Fuchang, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, and the Dalian gang were all eager to clear their positions. Overseas silver markets also trended lower in yesterday's (week) telegraphic communications. Therefore, the gold price has already exceeded seven hundred and twenty taels. The exchange rate is also tight and has already been reduced by half a notch. In the future, there will be room for consolidation. The market situation was very good at noon, with rumors that banks were continuing to absorb spot goods, so people's hearts were agitated and soared to the clouds. From seven hundred and twenty taels, it skyrocketed to thirty taels. Initially, the afternoon market was also strong, with buyers being quick. It had even exceeded seven hundred and thirty taels. However, major players such as Fuchang, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, and arbitrageurs were inclined to sell, and the market weakened, sharply falling eight or nine taels. The exchange rate was slightly seen. In the end, it seemed to turn mild. Spot public orders for February are now being distributed and resolved by the exchange as usual, as yesterday (the 2nd) was the first day of collection and settlement. It is expected that large bars will continue to decline this morning.</p>
<p>At noon, it soared to the sky. The opening price for March was 722.5 taels, an increase of 5.8 taels. This was because large bars were down 16/3, the forward price was down 1/8, and the silver price was also down 1/8. Private telegrams also decreased by 1/8. The United States still sold in small quantities, so people's hearts were high, and buyers continued to add 2.5 taels. However, sellers were still not lazy. Fuchang, Yuanheng, and goods arbitrageurs all reduced their holdings, gradually moving downstream, only counting 21 taels. The British gold was stable, and the industry was estimating the price for March to May at 1.3375. Although the first order was announced, and the US dollar had been reduced by 0.125 and the gold price had increased by 0.0125, the gold price may not have risen. In fact, Yongheng and others were not lazy, and the price had fallen to 19.8 taels. The internal British gold seemed loose, and Mitsui sold May at 1.34275. After that, Chenfeng, Yongyu, Fayong, and others suddenly bought, and Taikangrun and others sold April British gold at 4.375. Jia cana Li and others sold forward at 3.75, and Mitsui absorbed it at 3.75. Therefore, the gold price gradually rose. After ten o'clock, it was counted as 25 or 6 taels. Suddenly, it was heard that a certain bank bought a large amount of spot goods, reaching 27.8 taels at 10:50. In an instant, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Guli, and others sold, plunging 2.5 taels. At 11:05, it was 25.34 taels. Hengxing, Yuancheng, Fengyong, and others rushed to buy, especially May British gold at 1.33125. The bank teller was able to do the market and showed a sharp appearance, soaring to 30 taels. At noon, the market closed at 29 taels, and the goods were quoted at a discount of 1 tael. The spread here also retreated to 8 taels. The announced price was even 778.2 taels, a discount of 57 or 8 taels to 48 or 9 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market turned from strong to flat. The afternoon market opened at 730.05 taels, and Shunli Yuxing bought it smoothly. Then, there was more than one tael of ups and downs. India remittance telegrams reported a small amount of four or five annas, and Hengxing, Yuanchang, Shengyong, and others all advanced sharply, rising to 31.8 taels. Mitsui absorbed Dalian's 1.6 taels, and Huabi and others ate this month's British gold at 1.325. However, Zhifeng, Yongcui, Tai, and others came to sell, already losing more than 3 taels. At 2:30, it was 28.2 taels. Afterwards, banks mutually traded March at 1.325. Macali ate this month's Citibank at $30.09375, and Hengxing bought it back, so it returned to 3 taels, and at 3:00 it was 32.2 taels. Afterwards, the storm was intertwined, and it suddenly turned into a downwind, because Datong sold March British gold at 1.33125, and also sold this month's and April's Citibank at $30.0875, especially Dadecheng, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yongheng, and goods, etc., selling like a swarm, sharply cutting down 7 or 8 taels, until 4:00, it suddenly became 22.6 taels. However, there was a margin of about 2 taels. Before long, India remittance reported a small amount of one anna, and it was heard that Huabi and April British gold was 1.3375. HSBC bought May at the same price yesterday, and at 4:15 it was 25.5 taels, and then it retreated to 4.5 taels. At 4:30, the market closed at 725.3 taels, a continuous increase of 8.6 taels compared with last week, and a repeated increase of 26 taels in the last three days. After the market closed, it continued to retreat by about 2 taels, and the goods were quoted at a discount of 8 cents again. The largest price in one day was 21.8 taels, and the smallest price was 19.8 taels, a difference of 22 taels. The goods opened early at 22.5 taels, closed at noon at 28 taels, closed in the afternoon at 29 taels, and closed at 24.5 taels. The revealed price was a discount of 47 taels to 53 taels. The recorded closing prices for both the morning and afternoon markets were 24 taels to 29 taels in the morning and 19 taels to 24 taels in the afternoon. The water supplement was 24 taels in the afternoon and 19 taels in the morning. There were many transactions by bulls, and many transactions were made by peers. Hengxing Yuan, Taikangrun, Chenfengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Changshengyong, Yufayong, Yifengyong, Yuda, and Yuantai all advanced. Yuancheng and Yuanxingyong exited and re-entered. Wanxing, Shunli, Tongtaichang, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Tongfengyong, and goods all exited. Zhifengyong had some ups and downs. In the afternoon, Yuanheng, Changshengyong, Yuanchengyong, Wanxing, and Yuantai had inconsistent entries and exits. Hengxing Yu, Da Heng, Yuan, and Yifengyong all advanced. Guli, Cuidai, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, and Yuanxingyong all exited. Yongheng Luo and others sold, and many bulls increased their positions. The Dalian gang supplied more than was demanded, exporting a total of 3,000 pieces and importing 1,000 pieces. The Guangdong gang slightly bought.</p>
<h3>### Foreign Exchange Followed the Gold Market's Sharp Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed foreign exchange rates all decreased by half a notch, because the British, American, and Indian silver markets continued to decline the day before. The British exchange rate decreased by 0.125 to 1 shilling and 3 pence 0.125, the American dollar exchange rate decreased by 0.25 to $30.0625, the Indian exchange rate decreased by 0.75 to 84 rupees 0.75, the German exchange rate decreased by 1 yuan to 128 marks 0.75, the French franc exchange rate decreased by 7 yuan to 780 yuan, the Dutch guilder exchange rate decreased by 0.75 to 76 guilders, the Po exchange rate increased by 1.5 taels to 183.5 taels, and the Hong Kong exchange rate did not change at 77 taels. The Japanese gold increased by 0.0125 to 1.6 taels 0.015. The internal prices of the British, American, and Japanese markets were stable in the morning. Afterwards, the gold market's price increased sharply, so the trend became tighter. In the early afternoon, the benchmark gold price had exceeded the 730 taels mark, and the final selling momentum caused the market to fall by 8 or 9 taels, so the foreign exchange market also seemed to return to a flat state. However, the result compared to last Saturday was that the British gold decreased by 0.0625, the American dollar decreased by 0.125, and the Japanese gold increased by 0.0125. Chinese merchants' transactions were prosperous, but there were more sales than purchases. Yufengyong and others bought 20,000 pounds from Taiwan, Huabi, Mitsui, and Maihang Sumitomo Shanghai Zhengjin. Taikanglan Fuchang and others sold about 100,000 pounds to Sumitomo, Mitsui, Zhongfa, Huabi, and HSBC. They also mutually traded several thousand pounds and traded 200,000 to 300,000 US dollars. Meifu Foreign Company bought, and Dingkang and others in the gold industry also bought slightly. As for the Japanese gold, it was not very active, and the situation in the various foreign exchange markets was still stable.</p>
<h3>### Both the Interest Rate and Breakage Markets Showed Weakness</h3>
<p>Market Overview: At the beginning of the year, in the past, there was a possibility of development in business. However, last year, the national calendar was used, and the end of the year still followed the old customs, which must be fulfilled in mid-February. Therefore, the current time is for consolidation, and there is no time for development. The good market conditions are not as prosperous as usual. Therefore, the interest rate is weak, and the buying and selling atmosphere is also declining due to the weak hearts of the people. In the end, the market is relatively deserted.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices (Foreign Cents): The early market was 7 cents and 2 points 1 cent, a sharp drop of 1 cent compared to the previous day. The afternoon market improved by 0.25 cents to 7 cents and 2 points 1 cent 2.5 cents. The transaction volume of remittance and draft was 740,000 in the early market and 1,055,000 in the afternoon market. The banknote transaction volume was 55,000 in the early market and 5,000 in the afternoon market. The off-market banknote transaction volume was 179,000 in the early market and 135,000 in the afternoon market. The bank transaction volume was 650,000 in the early market and 550,000 in the afternoon market. The small money house transaction volume was more than 700,000. (Silver Breakage): The early market turned prosperous to 6 cents, and the afternoon silver breakage was 3 cents. The head of the plan did not add water, and the market atmosphere was very loose. The same industry broke tickets for more than 2 million, and bank mortgages were more than 1 million.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver): Yesterday, bank collection and settlement increased slightly due to Monday. Chinese merchants collected and settled 2.8 to 2.9 million, foreign merchants collected and settled 2.7 million, special settlement was 2 million, and settlement collection was 5 to 6 million. Various goods, exchange taxes, and other fees were collected and settled 7 to 8 million. 1.4 million was withdrawn from the warehouse. Japanese merchants' banks collected and settled 4.8 million in various fees, settled 1.7 to 1.8 million, and deposited 400,000 in the warehouse. Money houses collected and settled more than 45 million in silver public orders, settled 5.7 million in head of plan fees, and collected and settled more than 1.4 million in remittance fees from various routes. The cash collection was around 1 million. (Foreign Dollars): Banks collected and settled more than 1.8 million in foreign customer transactions, recovered and issued more than 2.1 million in banknotes. Money houses collected and settled 8.3 million in foreign public orders, settled more than 2.5 million in foreign head of plan fees, and borrowed and lent 1.9 million in foreign loans. The source of funds from foreign routes was more than 500,000. The local street collected more than 1.3 million in banknotes and cash.</p>
<h3>### Silver Coins Eagerly Sought, Price Surges by Half a Cent</h3>
<p>The Guangdong small foreign currency market has been calm and uneventful for several days, but yesterday there was another special surge. The market was extremely short of spot goods, and the demand was very high. As a result, the price rose sharply. The early market was 6 cents and 7 points, a sharp improvement of 2 cents compared to the previous day's early market. The afternoon market soared by 3 cents to a peak of 6 cents and 7 points 3 cents, an increase of more than half a cent compared to the previous day's early market. This caused the exchange rate listing on the market to be shortened daily, now only 0.07 cents for every 10 corners of foreign currency. The transaction volume was 150,000 corners in the early market and 85,000 corners in the afternoon market. The Jiangnan small foreign currency market was downstream, both the early and afternoon markets were 6 cents and 7 points, a slight decrease compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 2,000 corners in the early market and no transaction in the afternoon market. Copper coins were changed to 2,000 cash for 360,000 cash.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Opens New Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>Twenty-Year Tobacco Futures and Spot Contracts Now Open for Trading</p>
<p>Bond Prices Continue Upward Trend, Market Conditions Remain Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Securities Exchange opened trading for twenty-year tobacco treasury bonds. Both futures and spot contracts opened with high prices, and market conditions were strong. The futures market for other government bonds also performed well. Total turnover for morning and afternoon sessions exceeded 9.8 million, including approximately 2 million for the 1920s Reconstruction bonds, and 1.78 million for the 1920s Disbandment and Troop Reduction bonds. Twenty-year tobacco bonds accounted for more than 1.1 million. Other trading was quiet. Spot market turnover totaled 58,000 yuan, including approximately 20,000 yuan each for Reconstruction and 1920s Customs bonds, and only a few thousand yuan for other bonds. Price fluctuations were generally moderate. However, the overall bond market environment was positive, and many investors were entering the market, leading to firming prices. Spot prices for bonds such as Disbandment and Troop Reduction bonds and the 1920s Customs bonds, after dividend payments, were significantly higher than before. Futures prices were also good, rising by 0.2 to 0.6 or 0.7 yuan.</p>
<p>| Bond Type    | Spot/Future | Previous Opening | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Turnover       |</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Bullish Traders Close Positions, Market Remains Steady</h3>
<p>The yarn market was slightly flat due to profit-taking by bullish traders closing out large positions, making the trading environment somewhat looser. However, a certain industrialist's mindset remained strong. Due to the difficulty of long-term exchange rate gains and the inability to import foreign cotton, raw cotton prices were unlikely to fall fundamentally. Therefore, most traders were buying long in distant months. However, many small investors were selling short due to high prices. Spot yarn trading was very quiet as both customers and guilds were waiting and watching due to the new tax increases, refraining from transactions. Judging from the overall trend, the yarn market is unlikely to deviate from stability.</p>
<p>Man-Mark (Brand) Slightly Weak: The opening of the Man-Mark market was still strong due to the residual momentum from the previous day. The situation turned weak as bullish traders at Rongxing continued to close positions, and the market declined. Prices fell by one, two, three, four, five, six, and nine fen. The market rose slightly in the afternoon due to a shortage of sellers, and Japanese merchants made purchases. Total turnover for the day was 47,150 bales. Sales were Rongxing (5,950 bales), Senkang (1,950 bales), Tianjiang (3,000 bales), Heshen (1,600 bales), Hengyi (1,500 bales), and Yiyu (1,500 bales). Purchases were Guangfeng (2,050 bales), Ruidai (4,250 bales), Changfeng (3,100 bales), and Shenchang (2,200 bales). Closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>| March: 1594             | Down 12 | 67,200         |</p>
<p>Spot Sales Affected by New Tax: Due to the implementation of the new tax, spot yarn sales were quite light. According to statistics, the total daily purchases by various groups was 210 bales. The market was generally flat. Purchases included 125 bales from the Nanyang group, 10 bales from Tianjin, 30 bales from inland areas, 12 bales from Hanzhong, 20 bales from Jiangxi, 5 bales from Ningbo, and 2 bales from Anqing.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Turns Flat</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly flat because the continuous rise in recent days led to fewer new bulls. Although the U.S. cotton market was flat, Indian cotton trended upward, and the exchange rate narrowed, making it difficult to import foreign cotton at a reasonable price. Some traders still had bullish intentions. Japanese merchants had both buying and selling activity, but most of the Han traders sold short. In short, without a relaxation of exchange rates, a major downward trend is unlikely in the short term.</p>
<p>Han-Mark (Brand) Flat: The opening of the Han-Mark market showed a strong upward trend with U.S. cotton flat and Indian cotton rising. The current month rose sharply by 2.5 fen. However, prices for distant months trended downward. As a result, prices for each month fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. Market sentiment was calm in the afternoon, fluctuating by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Total turnover for the day was 90,300 dan. Sales were Tianlong (3,600 dan), Yiyu (2,400 dan), Hengyi (5,300 dan), and Changfeng (4,000 dan). Purchases were Gengfeng (8,600 dan), Changfeng (6,100 dan), Shenda (3,400 dan), and Dafu (3,500 dan). Closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>| March: 3770             | Down 0.51 | 144,700       |</p>
<p>Cotton Demand Weak: Spot cotton trading was flat. The source of supply was said to be 100 bales of Tong Cotton.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 38.00, Yongyu Factory purchase, 406 pieces delivered to the factory.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 36.75, Yongyu Factory purchase, 60 pieces delivered to the factory.</p>

<h3>Indian Cotton Rebounds on Short Covering Last Week</h3>
<p>Bombay: Due to speculative buying and short covering in the futures market last week, prices rose. However, when prices rose, many long positions took profits, and shippers also made hedge sales. As U.S. cotton softened, the market gradually declined. On the spot market side, export demand was excellent, and local manufacturers also made transactions. France mainly purchased Bengal and Oomra cotton. Japan sold slightly, and China gradually had demand. A summary of last week's statistics is appended below (unit: thousands of bales).</p>
<p>|                           | 1930           | 1931           |</p>

<p>| Other Regions              | 29             | 18             |</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot sales were not high last week. The futures market was firm and stable throughout the week. At the weekend, the trend was particularly firm due to many buyers and a lack of hedge sales. Egyptian cotton prices rose due to strong speculation in Alexandria. It is rumored that Alexandria will restrict sales, which would further strengthen the market next week if true.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Market Sales Pick Up, Turning Firm</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, arrivals in Lilu Road numbered in the twenties and thirties, and sales picked up. The North Group's white japonica rice became firmer because retailers raised their prices and competed for supply, and because suppliers had suffered too many losses and all wanted to wait and see. First-class special grade japonica rice was priced at 13.5 yuan, but this grade was very rare. Top-grade japonica rice on the broader market remained around 13 yuan. Arrivals of thin awn rice were slightly scarce, and the market was slightly hesitant. Yangdu indica rice was selling somewhat actively, with considerable interest from out-of-town buyers. Prices rose slightly, and buyers reduced their quantities. Conditions became firmer, and there was a large supply of ordinary rice. High-quality rice was not readily available and maintained a firm price. Medium-quality rice remained sluggish. Sales of white glutinous rice remained sluggish, and the overall market did not fluctuate much. All dealers reported that sales increased slightly because the cloudy and rainy weather made buyers wary of future supply shortages. Downstream sales were also good in recent days.</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, domestic arrivals continued. The sales market in this street was initially stagnant, then became normal. Tin white japonica rice was still weak in the morning, and prices were frequently adjusted downward. By noon, the market had turned firm based on news from the North, and the market stabilized. Arrivals of Jiangsu and Zhejiang high-grade white japonica rice were not strong, but general-grade rice continued to be purchased, although demand was uneven. Prices generally held steady, and high-grade rice even experienced a slight increase at one point. News of poor production of thin early rice from the South caused average appetite from outside purchasers. The market stabilized following the overall trend. Retail sales of Yangdu and other indica rice were slightly active, and prices were initially weak, then stabilized. Sales of top-grade white glutinous rice were sluggish. Fortunately, arrivals were scarce and prices were not reduced. Top-grade ordinary rice was still priced at 12.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customer Indica Rice Sales Sluggish, Expecting Price Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer indica rice market was halted by agreement of local customers, and the market was unusually sluggish. Arrivals of Jiangxi rice continued, and inventory was sufficient. Local retailers were paying attention to rice merchants downstream. Out-of-town customer groups were also waiting and watching, and although Guangdong customer groups and others had an appetite, they had to wait for lower market prices before making purchases. As a result, there were no bulk transactions throughout the day. If there is no sales digestion today or tomorrow, and arrivals do not stop, then prices are likely to decline gradually.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Markets Consistently Surge</h3>
<p>The labeled flour market trended toward tightness. Yesterday, the flour market saw a noticeable rise in the morning and afternoon. The market was boosted by the fact that various factories were willing to draw from inventory according to the standard market price. Customers with real needs were more actively procuring. Although the telegrams for foreign wheat were slightly down 0.1 or 0.2 yuan, Australian wheat prices had already risen to 4.1 taels, an increase of more than 0.15 yuan from the lowest price at the end of last month. Factories stopped selling, further improving the market. Closing prices for the current month were up by 0.015 yuan, March was up by 0.03 yuan, April was up by 0.0375 yuan, June was up by 0.02 yuan, and July, which was the first day of trading, opened at 2.045 taels and closed at 2.0575 taels, also up by 0.0125 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat Jumps Up by One Fen: Yesterday, wheat prices rose for all months after the market opened in the morning and afternoon. Prices for the current month were high due to deferred delivery of confirmed orders and many short positions due to the end of the lunar year. Australian white wheat prices rose sharply, further boosting market sentiment. Chicago and Canadian wheat quotations were slightly down 0.1 to 0.2 yuan for nearby months and slightly better for distant months, but the combined gold price made them difficult to obtain economically. As a result, outside bulls and inland groups increased buying, and short positions were also being covered. The closing price for the current month was up by a significant 0.11 yuan, next month was up by 0.06 yuan, April was up by 0.05 yuan, May was up by 0.04 yuan, and June was up by 0.05 yuan. July, which starts trading tomorrow, was priced at 3.84 taels, and spot wheat was scarce in both arrivals and sales.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Up 0.05 Yuan and Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no new telegrams from the sugar producing areas. The guild market was actively moving toward higher plateaus, because the exchange rate was trending upward and market sentiment was getting tight. The market turned upward again. Dutch sugar, No. 24 raw and white, opened at 10.0375 taels, then rose to 10.04 taels. High-grade goods traded at 10.045 to 10.0475 taels, and trading was quite brisk with over 2,000 bags changing hands. Compared to the previous day, prices increased by 0.05 yuan and were strong. Medium-grade white sugar and others were still lacking in trading. The Japanese sugar market also turned firm. High-grade goods even saw a slight increase. Meiji YR mark was 10.06 taels, YT mark was 10.0375 to 10.04 taels, YRO mark was 10 taels, and Minghua goods were 9.95 taels. YT mark was 10.035 taels. Although trading was sparse, the trend was very firm. The market for numbered plates was even quieter due to the approaching end of the settlement period.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Xiamen Sun-Dried Meat Becomes Marginalized</h3>
<p>Meat Arrives Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to a large reduction in the amount of Xiamen sun-dried meat that Nanyang groups purchased from local sources and shipped to Shanghai, prices in Shanghai have risen by 4 to 5 taels. However, recent arrivals have increased again. Due to cost considerations, suppliers still intend to raise prices further. Traders are unwilling to take on more inventory at high prices because the end of the settlement period is approaching, and this has become a marginalized situation. However, considering the inventory on hand, the quantity is not large, and there should be prospects for price increases in the future. Meat was transported by the Taiyuan wheel yesterday, with only six pieces in the next shipment. Because Shanghai inventory had already been exhausted, the market trend was very strong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai White Filature Facing Sluggish Sales in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign-owned silk market in Shanghai continued to be weak. Because Japanese raw silk imports to overseas markets were strong and inventories were soaring, filature sales could not rise, and telegrams about silk were still infrequent. Yesterday, Jardine imported 20 bales of Huangzhou filature and Zhonghe and others imported 20 bales of Baigan filature, and prices were generally weak.</p>
<h3>Needle Eyebrow Green Tea Sales Continue to Flow Smoothly to Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai foreign firms. British firms in particular, were still very interested, and Hua tea merchants were firm because of their thin inventories, and market prices continued to rise. There were also some scattered transactions for first and second grade Xiu Mei pearl tea, and the like, but the sales of needle eyebrow green tea became increasingly sluggish. Yesterday's Wu Yuan high class goods, although there were some small negotiations for foreign firms, But since the overseas arrival price was too low, the whole city had no transaction.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Prices Rebound Strongly for All Goods</h3>
<p>The local cotton cloth market was strong again yesterday. Because cotton yarn prices had risen continuously and the factory tax had already been implemented, most of the goods with silver backing from the end of January had already been sold. Tianjin groups took advantage of the trend to search for goods, so market sentiment was strong again. Fine cloth rose by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Colorful ball trumpets for children rose to 7 liang, Yanghe brand to 6.95 liang, and Red Flying Fish to 7.2 liang. Because the Flying Fish brand was being purchased by Tianjin groups, there was a shortage of spot goods. The demand for fine twill was also strong in this street, making it a popular choice for dyeing. Blue Double Fish was priced at 6.925 liang and Yanghe at 7.15 liang. Demand for coarse cloth from the military supplies groups remained strong. Spot goods for feeding horses had already sold out at 6.55 liang. 16-pound Five Cranes and 13-pound Double Horses and Dogs were also exceptionally popular.</p>
<p>The market for East and West piece goods also saw progress. Three Friends direct tribute flannel from the East rose by 0.0025 yuan, with traders offering 0.325 yuan and Tianjin groups buying at 0.32 yuan in deals involving more than 150 pieces. Gray light twill traded heavily at 5.1 taels. Sales in this street also had a slightly better atmosphere. Printed direct tribute flannel and fine serge were also being purchased. Hunting goose direct tribute flannel remained strong, selling for 0.39 yuan, and Moganshan for 0.385 yuan. However, velvet goods remained sluggish. Whether it was the Water Wave, Continuous Month, or Colorful Grid velvet, prices were generally falling. Dark-colored Tingfu opened at new high prices. Better patterns reached 0.245 yuan. Trading in foreign yarn orders was quite active, with 600 pieces of Dian Qiuxiang being made at a price of 10.95 taels. The current price has reached over 11 taels.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Since the previous public discussion of increasing prices, most of the dealers were unwilling to purchase goods because the sudden increase in customs duties and the appreciation of the Japanese yen made the cost of goods higher. Therefore, the asking price continued to rise. Although there were no bulk wholesale transactions, the retail business in the stores was still active. Tianxiang 888 direct tribute flannel rose to 7 liang, Rongtai 31452 to 7.25 liang. Ordinary Yuan Chang blue-gray serge (previously sold at around 2 taels) was now uniformly priced at 2.78 taels. Walter flannel was priced at 4.25 to 4.56 taels. Retail sales in stores were another 1.4 yuan per foot.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Reasons for Sudden Rise in Asphalt Price</h3>
<p>Short Sellers Suffer Heavy Losses</p>
<p>The new asphalt crop is harvested before winter. Due to a poor harvest in the winter of the year before last, the output decreased. Therefore, the autumn market of last year saw shortages and high prices. Han-Kou brand "Chong Jing" sold for 18.8 taels, and even Ma-Cheng oil rose to 18 taels. The market inventory was only about 2,000 dan. Before the new goods came out, there was a great deal of prosperity. When the domestic firms were shifting between the new and the old, they happened to have abundant accumulation. The total market volume was about seven or eight thousand dan. However, autumn sales were sparse. The new goods were coming into season, so everyone couldn't help but worry, so without considering what happened in the Han district, the Shanghai city fell of its own accord. At that time, it went down two taels. However, Han Kou remained as before. Later, after the arrival of a small amount of new oil, the prices started to fall. Chong Jing fell to 16.2 taels, and Xin Cheng fell to 15.2 taels, and there were rumors that they would see the wind of 14.68 taels. However, after the price fell, the source of supply became even more scarce, so the market returned and Han Kou brand Chong Jing increased to 17.2 taels, and Ma-Cheng increased to 16.8 taels. According to the reliable news from the place of origin, in the previous winter, the output of Jingzhou, Yichang, Zhijiang, and Jinshi in Hubei Province were even lower than last year. Only 20 percent of the crops were harvested. This made the Han City not export oil ever since. The morale also changed in the Shanghai firms. They said they have already cleared out of the oil sales and are not only not hoping for a price increase, but must look at a price reduction, so they are not preparing a stock. There are also several companies that sold short. It is heard that they sold to the most famous soap factory in the city for five or six hundred tons. The prices were divided into 18.8 taels for delivery in January, 18.4 taels in February, and 18 taels in March. They all went to the factory to be weighed. The January batch has already been delivered and must be slightly at a loss. However, the goods for February and March will suffer greater losses. Miscellaneous supplies, such as the Taihe oil from Wan Province and the Jiangxi Province oil from Lai Province, have mostly arrived, but after this it is feared that there will be very few. The Han Ma City price has already risen to this point. Including to the Shanghai meeting with a scale, the cost must be over 20 taels. At the beginning of the new harvest of the Lan oil in Zhe Province, it was already sold off by various places, and recently it has been in response to the price increase in the Han market. Only the Taizhou route is slightly inexpensive and may have some small amount that can be delivered. However, it cannot be hoped that the total will cover a large deficit, and the company that made the order cannot avoid a large loss.</p>
<h3>Metals: Trading Flat, Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The customers' groups have already ended their trading in metal goods, and the transactions of local manufacturers and builders are mostly scattered, so the market is very flat. However, because the exchange rate is falling, and there is still no reduction in the wind, morale remains high, and the prices remain firm and hard. The current market, such as 1- to 6-inch French nails, because the market goods are rarely exported and the output of this factory is limited, morale is swollen. The standard of courage is good, it is estimated 9 taels per barrel, and small nails at the bottom are even more fresh, selling at 14.5 taels for a 3-minute grade and 13.5 taels for 4- to 5-minute grades, and 11.5 taels for a 6-minute grade. Because of the lack of supply of English and American plain white iron and the thin arrivals, the price is firm, and the market price is still good. Also, the 24-gauge English goods are sold at a large price of 17.5 taels due to the high prices because of the lack of goods. Corrugated iron has few transactions, but the market is still preferred. It is estimated the 26-gauge patterned iron has a good prospect because the construction groups have concluded a large number of transactions. The English steel plate is slightly quiet because the customer sales in the northern provinces are sluggish, but there is little goods at the bottom so there is no terror in the market. Tinplate business has been very progressive, and market conditions have improved because the arrival of goods has already diminished, so there is no potential to rise. Since the factories have been raising prices continuously, and there are a lot of stocks in the hands of the industry, it is possible to profit by one, two, three, or four mace. However, from the side of the user, it is inevitable that they will suffer a slight loss. The price of bamboo joint steel bars is estimated to be 110 taels, and the transaction is quite strong. The black iron skin trade is flat, and the market is seeing a decline. Fortunately, there is a limited amount of goods at the bottom, and there are no huge losses among the colleagues. The new foreign yuan, triangle iron, flat iron, and steel checkers are all on the rise. However, it is difficult to hope for activity in the aspect of trading. The arrival and sale of new lead wires is small, and the market is flat. White lead skin, purple copper, white lead, and pure flannel have only scattered trades during the year, so there are no special conditions in the city that cannot be recorded.</p>

<h3>Dr. Monroe Lobbies for Economic Improvement Plan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Visit to Song Ziwen to Present Everything</p>
<p>Advocates Converting European Debt into Loans to China</p>
<p>Returning to the U.S. in One Month to Actively Proceed</p>
<p>Professor Monroe of Columbia University in the United States came to Shanghai last month to attend the standing meeting of the China Cultural Education Foundation. He then went north to Peiping and Tianjin before returning to Shanghai with Kuo Ping-wen. When Dr. Monroe was in the United States, he prepared a plan to improve China's economic conditions, advocating that Germany supply China with raw materials and funds for various construction projects, and that China pay off debts to European countries related to the European war on behalf of Germany, thereby completing the Young Plan. During his visit to China, he met with President Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, Industry Minister Kong Xiangxi, and Railway Minister Sun Ke, exchanging opinions on this proposal. Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Monroe, accompanied by his son and Kuo Ping-wen, Liu Yunfang, and others, visited Finance Minister Song Ziwen at the Central Bank to present this plan. Song agreed to consider it.</p>
<p>Plan Contents: The content of Dr. Monroe's plan to improve China's economic conditions is that Germany should pay England and France with raw materials and funds, or a portion thereof, to China, thereby converting European war debts into loans to China, enabling Germany to open up foreign markets and stabilize the precarious economic situation of Germany and Europe. The methods are (1) The United States accepts China's obligation to repay and uses the new business operations as collateral. (2) This fund is supervised by a committee organized by the countries involved. (3) The funds paid are used by the United States to collect accounts from England and France, who then collect accounts from Germany. Dr. Monroe believes that if China does not quickly undertake construction work, it will fall into communist chaos. Without foreign funding, all construction projects cannot be initiated.</p>
<p>Meeting with the Minister of Finance: Taking advantage of his time in Shanghai, Dr. Monroe planned to visit Finance Minister Song Ziwen to discuss his plan. Originally scheduled to be accompanied by Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting yesterday, Wang had matters to attend to in Yong, so he sent Deputy Director Liu Yunfang of the Foreign Ministry Office to accompany him. Yesterday at 11:30 AM, Finance Minister Song met with Dr. Monroe and others in the Minister's office at the Central Bank for about 30 minutes. Since this was a personal opinion, Finance Minister Song agreed to consider it in detail and made no other comments. It is heard that this visit has already garnered considerable sympathy from the United States, and the purpose of bringing his plan to the State Department in Washington D.C. is to observe the situation in all aspects.</p>
<p>Dr. Monroe's Remarks: This reporter visited Dr. Monroe at his residence yesterday. According to his statement, this plan is entirely his personal opinion, and it is not yet convenient to express any opinions on the attitude of the U.S. and Chinese governments and the opinions of various important figures. I have three additional points about this plan: (1) Most people believe that after Germany</p>

(3) A letter was sent to the Finance Discussion Committee requesting that committee members involved in commerce, including Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiyu, Wang Yansong, Ye Huijun, Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runqing, etc., respect the opinions of various industries when discussing the city's business tax and avoid repeating the mistakes of the Zhejiang business tax regulations. The motion passed. (4) A letter was sent to accountants such as Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo, requesting them to respect the Ministry's guidelines when discussing business tax rates, consider the hardships of merchants and residents, and not rely solely on Western theories that violate national conditions. The motion passed.

<h3>Municipal Government Actively</h3>
<p>Planning to Dredge the Wusong River</p>
<p>Organizing the Wusong River Dredging Committee</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang Qun, Vice Chairman Song Ziliang</p>
<p>The Wusong River is an important river in this city. It has been silted up for many years, making shipping inconvenient. The municipal government, in view of this, is now planning to dredge it. The importance of this river, the dredging process over the years, and the current organization of the Shanghai Municipal Wusong River Dredging Committee are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Importance of the Wusong River (1) The</p>
<p>Location of the Wusong River: The Wusong River, formerly known as the Songjiang River, originates from the Guajingkou in Wujiang County, receiving water from Taihu Lake, and flows eastward for over 210 li to the Waibaidu Bridge in Shanghai, where it merges with the Huangpu River. The section between the two is commonly known as the Suzhou River. (2) The Wusong River is a vital waterway for draining water from Taihu Lake in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Taihu Lake is located between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, covering an area of approximately 36,000 qing. The water from the Tianmu Mountains in the southwest and the water from the Changrun prefectures in the northwest flow into it, forming a vast expanse of water seeking an outlet to the sea. The Wusong River is located directly downstream. Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, those discussing farmland water conservancy in western Zhejiang and central Wu have regarded it as the sole major channel for draining water from Taihu Lake. Its unobstructed flow is crucial to the interests of the prefectures surrounding the lake. (3) The Wusong River is related to the irrigation of farmland in various counties along the river. The Wusong River main stream is over 200 li long, with crisscrossing streams and ports on both sides, covering a very wide area. The farmland in the eight counties of Wujiang, Wuxian, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jiading, Shanghai, and Taicang Bingshan along the river directly or indirectly benefits from its water, totaling over 7.56 million mu. (4) The Wusong River is an important waterway for shipping between this city and the interior. This city is a major port for trade between China and foreign countries. The transportation of goods between the Suzhou-Changzhou Canal area and Shanghai relies on this river as the most direct and reliable route. Recently, due to silting in the lower reaches, heavily loaded ships must detour through the Huangpu River, Dianpu River, or the Yangtze River, resulting in longer journeys and higher transportation costs. The river has numerous tributaries on both sides, forming a network. Simply dredging the main river to make it deep and wide will allow steamships to travel freely without obstruction, which will greatly promote commercial development. In addition, its role as a harbor for ship mooring and a source of municipal water has a close relationship with the development of this city's commercial port.</p>
<p>The Dredging Process: It is found that although this river has been repaired and dredged between the years of the Republic of China 9th and 13th years, it was implemented in a piecemeal fashion, starting and stopping at times. Additionally, with heavy traffic and tidal conditions, it has recently become silted up as before. If a comprehensive plan is not made to dredge it, the water conservancy of the entire river will be greatly affected. In the Republic of China 3rd year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government planned to dredge the river and collected additional donations based on land area to fund the dredging. The Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau was established to take charge of the matter. Construction began in February of the 9th year and was completed in May of the 13th year, excavating a total of 176,910 cubic meters of earth, from the Fanwangdu Pier Bridge to the Xinzha Bridge, with a length of 2,822 zhang. During the construction period, the Provincial Bureau was financially strained and the project almost came to a halt. Subsequently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce successively invited Shanghai commercial groups and public groups from the eight counties along the river to establish the Wusong River Water Conservancy Association to assist the government in managing water conservancy and transportation, raising 600,000 yuan over five years, with Shanghai merchants and farmland in the eight counties each responsible for half. The first phase of construction was carried out from Xinzha East to the Pujiang River, and was completed in May of the 15th year, with a length of 920 zhang, excavating 128,323 cubic meters of earth and spending over 219,000 yuan. It was originally planned to continue dredging the sections west of Xinzha, but the project was interrupted due to insufficient funds. The cost of dredging is quite high, and the section within this city's area has the heaviest shipping traffic and should be dredged as soon as possible to benefit the waterway. The situation regarding the establishment of the Committee.</p>
<p>In view of the above situation, it is proposed to organize the Shanghai Municipal Wusong River Dredging Committee. On the one hand, various water conservancy professionals related to river and port dredging will be recruited to jointly plan and design the dredging. On the other hand, suggestions from citizens will be widely adopted to gather ideas and achieve early success. It is learned that the committee is composed of five people: Mayor Zhang Qun, Dredging Bureau Director Song Ziliang, Municipal Public Works Bureau Director Shen Yi, Municipal Government Advisor Xi Dingmo, and Dredging Bureau Consultant Zhao Xien. The establishment meeting was held at the Municipal Government Public Affairs Society at 2:00 PM yesterday, and Mayor Zhang was elected as Chairman and Director Song as Vice Chairman. It was also decided to establish the committee's address at the Municipal Government Public Affairs Society at 43 Weihaiwei Road. The organization rules have also been approved and implemented by the municipal government. The Shanghai Municipal Wusong River Dredging Committee Organization Rules: 1. This committee is established to dredge the section of the Wusong River in the Shanghai urban area and will be dissolved upon completion of the project. 2. This committee is subordinate to the Shanghai Municipal Government and subject to its supervision and direction. 3. The committee consists of five members, with one chairman and one vice chairman elected from among the members, all serving without pay. 4. The committee may hire specialized personnel and appoint clerks as needed for its affairs. 5. The powers of this committee are as follows: (A) Matters related to project dredging; (B) Matters related to temporary management; (C) Matters related to project protection; (D) Matters related to the removal of obstacles. 6. The detailed rules of this committee will be determined separately. 7. If there are any matters not covered in these rules, they may be resolved by this committee and amended. 8. These rules shall take effect from the date of approval by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Sino-German</h3>
<p>Airlines Established</p>
<p>The Eurasian Air Route Has Been Decided</p>
<p>Preparations Have Been Made to Build Airfields</p>
<p>German Technicians Arrive in Shanghai Within Days</p>
<p>After the Sino-German Airlines held a board meeting in Beijing this time and resolved various important issues, it is heard that the company has been officially established. Since February 1st, the Sino-German Airlines office has been established at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Transportation. The Chinese side's directors and deputy directors of the finance, aviation, and operations groups have all taken office, while the German side's directors and deputy directors of the three groups have not yet been appointed. The previous board meeting resolved that Wei Yifu would be the chairman, and Shuang Qing and Schmidt would be the vice chairmen. The first batch of seven technicians hired from Germany will arrive in Shanghai within three or four days. The air route has been decided to pass through Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Qiqihar, and reach Manchuria. Leaving Manchuria, a new company organized by Russia will take over the route from Haimawei to Irkutsk and reach Moscow to Berlin. However, the construction of aircraft hangars and the arrangement of airfields are still in preparation at the above four stations. Therefore, it is said that a test flight from Shanghai around the 15th of this month may not be a reality.</p>

<h3>Party and Government Agencies</h3>
<p>Report on the Significance of Organizing Various Labor Unions</p>
<p>Starting Yesterday, the Municipal Party Headquarters and Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Convene Discussion Meetings with Labor Union Representatives</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters Public Training Committee is holding meetings with representatives of various labor unions in the city to address labor union reorganization, starting yesterday. The meetings are held separately at the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau. The labor unions summoned yesterday, the main points of the discussions, and the labor unions to be summoned today are listed below.</p>
<p>Discussion Meeting at the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Labor unions summoned: Youren Silk Weaving Factory Labor Union, Ni Zuocai, Zhou Hehui, Qian Yuanfu; Meiwen Silk Weaving Factory Labor Union, Kuang Hesheng, Zheng Supu, Wu Xingquan; Meifeng Silk Weaving Factory Labor Union, Chen Rongdan, Wang Xianyao, Jiang Bingshi, Wu Zhixin, Xing Zhangfa; Fenghua Silk Weaving Factory Labor Union, Ni Longsheng; Meiya No. 2 Silk Factory Labor Union, Tong Xinshu, Zheng Fumin; Xianghua Silk Weaving Labor Union, Xiong Xianglin, Guo Yuchi, Wang Shichang; Yutong Silk Weaving Labor Union, Ju Xiaofu, Wang Zhaolin, Xue Zuoxiang; Zhenhua Silk Weaving Factory Labor Union, Zhang Butao, Ye Huifu; Yingchang Match Factory Labor Union, Chen Songyao, He Guitang, Yu Zhangfu; Zhenhua Paint Factory Labor Union, Mao Guanle, Zhao Shengde; Zhufeng Enamel Factory Labor Union, Song Huai Chun, Li Yinlin; Wuzhou Guben Soap and Medicine Factory Labor Union, Li Jingyi, Li Mengnan, Chen Xiaomei; Jingyi Leather Factory Labor Union, Huang Xingfu, Zhu Kangyuan, Fu Wenge. The above all held discussions at the Municipal Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Discussion: The Citizen</p>
<p>Training Committee prepared a discussion outline in advance for the discussion members' reference. The following is a summary: Our country's new Labor Union Law has been promulgated for a long time, and the labor unions in this city should have started and completed their reorganization long ago. However, due to many practical obstacles, it was not easy to start, so it has been delayed until now. Now that the National Assembly is approaching, representatives from various places must be produced. Therefore, the Central Government has ordered that various people's organizations be reorganized completely by the end of February. Although this city has been granted an extension of one month by the Central Government, time is fleeting and there is not much time left, so there is no room for delay. Therefore, this committee, together with the Social Affairs Bureau, will first actively reorganize the labor unions that have already been approved. The first step is to convene representatives of various labor unions to hold discussion meetings. The main purpose is to explain the reasons for reorganizing the labor unions. (1) The labor union area in this city has now been divided into ten districts. According to law, only one labor union can be organized by workers in the same industry or occupation within each area. Therefore, those organized by branch factories in the past should now merge with the labor unions of other factories in the same enterprise in the same area. Labor unions jointly organized by workers from two districts or the entire city in the past should now be organized separately by district and industry. (2) The shop employees' association, i.e., the so-called workers' association, should now be dissolved according to law. The shop employee members can immediately join the same industry guild according to law, while the occupational workers, such as veteran clerks, can still organize separately, but they must be reorganized according to the Labor Union Law. (3) The content of the articles of association or the number of officers of the established labor unions may not be fully in line with the Labor Union Law. According to law, they should be re-registered, i.e., reorganized. (4) The National Assembly is approaching, and the labor union representatives in this city should be produced on schedule. However, members of labor unions that have not been legally registered do not have the right to elect or be elected. Therefore, the reorganization of the labor unions must be completed quickly. Explanation of the reasons for the delayed reorganization: (1) Regarding the issue of factory labor unions, after several rounds of hard work, the Central Government approved last month the establishment of branch offices and the organization of a cadre committee under the district labor union, representing the rights of the members. (2) Regarding the issue of workers' associations, after repeated petitions, considerable results have been obtained, i.e., after the dissolution of the workers' association, all previously agreed-upon group contracts that are valid will be reviewed by the party and government agencies. The party and government agencies guarantee the validity of the parts that do not violate laws and regulations. In the future, if disputes arise between employees and employers, shop employees may elect representatives to request the party and government agencies to mediate properly. If there are more than fifteen shop employees in a shop, they may request the shop owner to allow them to add one representative to join the same industry guild as a representative. The Central Government also agreed to change the word "may" in Article 8 of the Implementing Rules of the Same Industry Guild Law to "should." Occupational workers who are not shop employees may organize occupational labor unions according to the Labor Union Law. Explanation of the steps to proceed with the reorganization: The first step is to divide the labor union area. The second step is to convene representatives of established labor unions for discussion. The third step is to have the Municipal Party Headquarters appoint five to eleven labor union reorganization committee members from each district to be responsible for reorganizing the labor unions in that industry within each district. After the reorganization is completed, a members' congress or representatives' congress will be convened to elect officers and establish a formal labor union. The fourth step is to reorganize the factory labor unions into branch offices according to law after the district labor unions are established.</p>
<p>Representatives' Opinions: After the</p>
<p>representatives of various labor unions summoned yesterday registered, they discussed with the officials assigned by the Citizen Training Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau separately. They all expressed acceptance of the reorganization issue and put forward many opinions. The main points are briefly described as follows: (1) Are occupational workers in the area who do not meet the legal number of people allowed to organize? (2) If there are not enough statutory industrial factories in the area, if there are no factories in the same industry, will the organization of the existing labor unions continue? (3) If the labor unions in various factories are unwilling to merge into the district labor union, what should be done? (4) Hope to protect past labor-capital contracts. (5) Hope to promptly promulgate organizational regulations such as the district labor union. In addition, there are many other opinions, which are not listed. The discussion members of the Citizen Training Committee have answered the above five items separately and given instructions.</p>

<p>The candle industry workers in this city requested to improve their treatment. The general meeting passed a proposal to modify ten conditions. The employer group, Candle Industry Guild, resolved at the general meeting to refuse to raise wages, resulting in no result from independent consultations. In order to avoid the expansion of the labor dispute, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation meeting on January 26, but it was not resolved due to the persistence of both parties. The bureau convened a second mediation committee meeting yesterday afternoon to conduct mediation. After a long period of discussion, the case was announced to be resolved. The details of the situation are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Silk Merchants Request Removal of Silk Cocoon Business Tax</h3>
<p>Silk Factory Industry Guild Chairman Shen Huachen convened a standing committee yesterday and decided to telegraph the Ministry of Finance, Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Finance Department today, requesting them to consider that the silk industry is related to international trade and to remove the silk cocoon industry from the sales of goods category in the business tax rate table to avoid levying taxes and maintain the real estate industry.</p>
<h3>Tea and Food Industry Discusses Requesting Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Tea and Food Industry Guild recently issued the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations. The regulations listed the tea and food industry in the 21 per mille category, the purpose of which is to treat it as a luxury item. Therefore, it convened a temporary representatives' meeting on the previous day (1st). Fifty representatives, including Yang Qixian, Zhu Yongqing, and Xu Jueshi, attended. Huang Zhenyu was publicly elected as chairman to perform the etiquette and report the documents. Then, the discussion began and it was resolved to request a reduction in the tax rate using the following methods: (1) Appoint Yang Qixian, Zhu Yongqing, and Xu Jueshi to handle this case exclusively. (2) Participate in the Tax Regulations Research Committee. (3) Submit a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government to request a reduction, stating the following reasons: (A) Most tea and food items are pastries, which are necessities for travel or household consumption to satisfy hunger, not luxury items. (B) The tea and food industry also sells canned green salted candies and other items. The business tax of each industry has already been paid. Now, taxing the tea and food industry again is a double tax. (C) Pastries and tea food are the same items. The South-North goods industry also sells canned green salted tea and food. However, the pastry industry is listed in the 2 per mille category, and the South-North goods industry is listed in the 5 per mille category. It is inevitable that there is favoritism and unfairness. (D) Those who levy silk tax will also refund silk tax, and those who levy silk tax will also refund cocoon tax in order to avoid heavy taxes. The various items sold by the tea and food industry have one item that includes three taxes, which cannot be counted. It should not be subject to the highest business tax again. (E) For the sake of fulfilling the national burden, the industry has to reluctantly admit it, but it should be based on the Ministry's business tax outline and should not exceed 2 per mille. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>Hunan Provincial Government Attracts Tea Merchants</h3>
<p>Business Travel Safety</p>
<p>Hunan Province is Responsible for Protection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government received a letter from the Hunan Provincial Government yesterday stating that Chinese tea has always been a major export commodity, absorbing a large amount of foreign investment every year. Recently, due to the rise of Indian and Ceylon tea and the cessation of Russian trade, the sales of Chinese tea have gradually decreased. In particular, the tea industry in our province has suffered even greater losses due to foreign merchants' manipulation and communist bandits' devastation. The letter stated that measures should be taken to provide relief to improve people's livelihoods. In addition to ordering various tea farms to conduct thorough research on planting methods and guide farmers to improve the quality, special attention should be paid to protecting the safety of tea merchants' business. Dongping area in Anhua County, Hunan Province, is the most prosperous tea-producing area. The county government has been ordered to thoroughly organize and strictly train the neighborhood watch teams, station them in tea-producing areas, and instruct the county governments of Xinhua, Yiyang, Yuanjiang, and Ningxiang to implement joint defense to eliminate bandits and facilitate merchants. Currently, water and land transportation in all counties is smooth. As the spring season is approaching, it is feared that tea merchants from other provinces may not understand the truth and have concerns about coming. In addition to sending separate letters, we also sent a letter to your municipal government to ask you to inform the chambers of commerce under your jurisdiction to notify tea merchants to come to Anhua and other counties in our province to pick and process spring tea in due course to avoid missing the opportunity. Our province will be responsible for protecting the safety of business and travel. We hereby declare, etc. It is reported that the municipal government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to inform the municipal chamber of commerce to notify the tea merchants.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks to Abolish the Shaoxing Wine Landing Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Printed Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau yesterday, requesting the abolition of the Shaoxing wine landing tax, which is similar to the likin tax. The original telegram stated: On January 31, the Shanghai Shaoxing Wine Industry Association submitted a report stating that before the establishment of the public sale system, Shaoxing wine transported to Shanghai was only subject to one likin tax collected by the Shanghai Tax Bureau under the former Department of Finance. During the Republic of China, when the public sale was established, a special bureau was set up, and this tax was collected by the Jiangsu Shanghai Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Branch Bureau. In addition to this tax, a landing tax was also collected. With one item taxed three times, merchants have endured the burden for decades without daring to violate it. Now that the National Government has issued an order to implement the abolition of likin, this landing tax, which is in the nature of likin, should be abolished to demonstrate fairness and alleviate merchants' difficulties. Therefore, we hereby submit a report requesting you to instruct the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau to exempt the collection of Shaoxing wine landing tax on schedule to comply with the law, etc. It is stated that the landing tax is indeed in the nature of likin and should be abolished. It is said that Shaoxing wine has already paid the likin tax and the public fee, and is then followed by the landing tax. The principle of one item, one tax is inevitably inconsistent. It seems appropriate to formulate an appropriate tax rate and not allow a landing tax similar to likin to be a stain after the abolition of likin. According to the aforementioned situation, we hereby send a telegram requesting your bureau to investigate, review, and instruct to abolish the landing tax to emphasize the merit of the law. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully says.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Minhang Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Minhang Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai County prepared for reorganization in accordance with the new Chamber of Commerce Law last year. On September 18, 19th year of the Republic, a general meeting of members was convened to elect officers. Because there were no members of the same industry association, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce did not approve the record. The order was immediately forwarded to the representatives of various industries to quickly initiate the organization of the same industry association. According to the statistics, there are 11 industries in the whole town that meet the qualifications stipulated in Article 3 of the Industrial and Commercial Association Law: sauce and wine, used clothing, flower rice, dried goods, fruits, tofu, teahouses, cigarette paper, pickled fresh food, teahouses, and barbershops. The same industry associations have applied to the Shanghai County Party Department for approval to issue permits in accordance with the law, and have sent personnel to guide the organization and declare its establishment. Representatives to the Chamber of Commerce were appointed. The Chamber of Commerce then convened a general meeting of members again a few days ago to elect 139 members to attend the meeting in accordance with the law. The county government appointed Wu Jingqing, the head of the first district, as the representative to supervise the election. The county party department sent Comrade Hu Naiwen to the venue to guide the ceremony. The presidium, Chen Lujun, reported on the progress of the previous reorganization. Then, the representatives of the county government and the county party department gave speeches successively. The instructors called the roll and distributed the ballots. Zhang Boliang and other 15 executive committee members and Dong Baorong and other seven supervisory committee members were elected on the spot. At the same time, alternate executive and supervisory committee members were elected. The first executive committee meeting was convened again the day before yesterday, and Chen Lujun, Zhang Jingling, Zhang Boliang, Fan Shilin, and Tao Shaochun were elected as standing committee members, with Chen Lujun as chairman.</p>
<h3>Announcement from the Money Industry on Urging the Payment of Cash Reserve Funds</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the date for additional deposits</p>
<p>The Money Industry Association informed the members and Yuansheng colleagues handling the collection and delivery that the cash reserve funds that should be paid every year for the Northern City colleagues are slightly different in terms of time this time due to the change to the Gregorian calendar. The notice stated: We hereby inform you that the cash reserve funds for the Northern City colleagues were discussed by the colleagues last year. After the collection and delivery were completed on the 16th day of the twelfth month of the lunar calendar every year, each household deposited an additional 10,000 taels of silver into the public treasury. The additional silver was returned in full on the 16th day of the first month of the following year. This has been done. Our colleagues have followed the Gregorian calendar and should handle the additional silver at the end of the lunar year at the end of the Gregorian year. However, the total collection and payment for the current year will end on February 15, 20th year of the Republic. The additional silver deposit for the colleagues should be handled before the final settlement. The date for the additional deposit of cash reserve funds for the colleagues is scheduled for February 4th. We hereby send a letter in advance to inform you that we hope that each precious village will send a list of codes for the standard silver of 10,000 taels of cash reserve funds to the public treasury on the morning of this day. The fund committee will count the amount in person, and each village will seal the silver box and take back the receipt for future reference. For the remaining silver outside the original box, please draw a paper bill for the full amount and send it to the central treasury for a simpler total deposit. We hope you will follow this. Sincerely, to each precious village. The Money Industry Association.</p>
<p>[HThe First Batch of Interns from the Merchants' College Practice Maritime Skills]</p>
<p>Twenty-two graduates from the first batch of students of the Merchants' College, including Wang Yiyuan and Yu Yingsheng, were assigned to various ships for internships by the General Administration at the request of Principal Deng. The General Manager Li formulated the method as follows:</p>
<p>Assignment to the Gongping Ship: After consultation between Li Zhonggong and Wang Minghao, the chief of the shipping department, the 22 students were assigned to the Gongping ship, the largest oceangoing vessel of the bureau, to serve as trainee crew members and were assigned positions such as captain, first mate, second mate, and chief engineer to learn on the sea. The internship period is one year. During the internship, each person will receive a stipend of 15 yuan, and the trainee captain will receive 50 yuan. The ship is scheduled to board the ship before the 10th of this month, and the captain of the Gongping ship has been ordered to arrange berths and other matters.</p>
<p>Regulations for Internship Courses: The internship courses for the students after boarding the ship are formulated by the shipping department as sailor work, rudder and anchor usage and management, navigation ship position observation work and calculation method, departure, mooring, and port management method, weather measurement and disaster prevention rescue, cargo loading and management method, international signals, and engine room work, etc.</p>
<p>Regulations for Expenses: Because each member of the Gongping Ship learns on board, adding one or two deputy and two more tea attendants on the ship, all food matters are handled by the supervisor concurrently. The estimated monthly fee for each person is 594 yuan, and the annual expenditure is 7,128 yuan.</p>
<p>Training of Seafarers: After the internship period for this batch of students expires, the bureau can use them to assign them to various ships to take up the positions of sailors and gradually recover the right of foreign sailors. It is estimated that in five or six years, all ships in the bureau can be fully staffed by domestic maritime personnel to serve as captains, first mates, and other positions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Collides with China Merchants' Guanda Ship</h3>
<p>Losses of 6,000 Gold Dollars Borne by the Japanese Ship</p>
<p>Negotiations are underway on the issue of maritime safety</p>
<p>The Japanese merchant Shita Steamship Company's Ginzan Maru transported coal to Shanghai and unloaded it at the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. The captain of the ship neglected his duties and damaged the China Merchants Bureau's Guanda ship and Wharf No. 3, resulting in significant losses. For the sake of the Guanda ship's maritime safety, negotiations have been initiated with the Japanese side, but the Japanese are shirking and delaying. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Responsibility for the Accident Lies with the Japanese Ship, Ginzan Maru: The coal loaded by the Ginzan Maru was unloaded at the China Merchants Bureau on January 31st at 11:18 a.m. When the Japanese ship arrived at the Jinliyuan Wharf, the China Merchants Bureau had already reserved Wharf No. 3 for the ship to berth. The wharf manager specially reserved a 305-foot space for the 260-foot Japanese ship to berth, which was more than enough. However, when the ship was approaching the wharf, it still drove fast towards Wharf No. 3. The Nanhua liner, Guanda, which was berthed at Wharf No. 2, was loading export goods. Seeing the Ginzan Maru approaching rapidly, it was greatly shocked. At that time, the wharf manager and the crew of the Guanda ship shouted loudly, ordering the Japanese ship to stop immediately and to reverse quickly to avoid a collision. Unexpectedly, the captain of the Ginzan Maru was already dumbfounded and did not know what to do. With a loud crash, the huge disaster of the collision occurred.</p>
<p>Both the Ship and the Wharf Were Damaged: The Guanda ship was berthed at the wharf and could not avoid the situation. Seeing that the Japanese ship could not be stopped, it was feared that a major disaster would occur if it was violently hit. Therefore, two anchor chains were thrown out to block it. Unexpectedly, the Japanese ship came so fast that the Ginzan Maru first broke one of the Guanda's giant chains. Then, the ship crashed into the stern of the Guanda, breaking the iron plates of the outer rudder of the after cabin into a large hole more than four feet in both directions. Fortunately, it was above the waterline and the cabin was not flooded. After hitting the Guanda, the Ginzan Maru also broke a plum blossom pile on Wharf No. 3. The ferocity of the impact can be imagined. The bow of the Japanese ship was also damaged due to the counterforce, and its flagpole was broken. After the incident, it finally docked at Wharf No. 3. With a space of more than 300 feet, a 260-foot ship still caused this disaster. The responsibility lies entirely with the captain of the Japanese ship for neglecting his duties.</p>
<p>Both Parties Sent Personnel to Inspect the Ship: After the incident, China Merchants sent ship surveyor Zhang and Shita sent Wuchuan to the Jinliyuan Wharf to inspect the results. In addition to the damage to the Guanda ship, the repair cost is about 5,000 gold dollars, and the loss of one plum blossom pile is about 600-700 yuan, which Shita admitted to compensate. According to the China Merchants Bureau's ship surveyor, the Guanda ship was severely damaged and should be inspected in the dock according to regulations to see if the rudder wheel, leaves, and water tank in the after cabin are damaged. Because the goods are fully loaded, it is impossible to know clearly. If a danger occurs on the way, it will affect the lives and property of the entire ship. However, the Japanese ship surveyor insisted that the Guanda ship's damage was above the waterline and there was no other danger. There is no need to enter the dock and can continue to operate normally.</p>
<p>Maritime Safety Issues: Yesterday afternoon, Shita's representative came to the China Merchants Bureau to negotiate this matter and firmly denied that the interior of the Guanda ship was damaged. The China Merchants Bureau immediately sent a letter to Shita Steamship Company, roughly stating that according to your company's ship surveyor, the damage is above the waterline and the ship can operate. In case of danger after going to sea, the matter is of great importance and cannot be taken lightly. If your company can bear the Guanda ship's maritime safety, please reply with a letter of proof (indicating responsibility, then the Guanda ship can be exempted from entering the dock for further inspection). Otherwise, for the sake of cautious navigation, we can only unload the goods and re-inspect. All losses such as suspension of shifts must also be borne by your company. The decision on whether to open is pending after the reply letter arrives.</p>

<h3>Kidnappers from Taicang Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>On September 2nd of last year, a major kidnapping and robbery case occurred in Taicang. Several hostages were kidnapped on the spot and have not yet been rescued. Although the local government has sent detectives to investigate and arrest the criminals, Nai Hongfei has disappeared without a trace. Until 10:40 a.m. the day before yesterday, Quan Lin, the deputy captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Taicang County Public Security Bureau, came to Shanghai and passed by North Chengdu Road in the Public Concession. He saw Yang Desheng (aka Yang Damaizi) from Haizhou, a bandit involved in the case. He presented an order and asked Chinese constable No. 3125 and Chinese detective Liu Zonghan to arrest Yang and take him to the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. The police station's lawyer stated the case, and Deputy Captain Quan Lin complained about the previous situation and requested that the defendant be questioned. The defendant claimed to live at No. 394 Xinzha Road and denied the kidnapping and robbery case. After Judge Ge Zhitan verified the confession, he ordered the defendant Yang Desheng to be temporarily detained and asked the investigation team leader to report the detailed case to the Dacang County Government and send a letter to the court for further verification.</p>
<h3>Deputy Commissioner Wheeler Will Retire and Return to His Country</h3>
<p>Mr. Wheeler, the deputy commissioner of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau Police Department, has served for more than 20 years and will soon retire and return to England for recuperation. Mr. Hui was recruited from England by the Engineering Bureau to Shanghai. He initially served as the Western constable of No. 85 Sandao Tou. During the Qing Dynasty, the bureau selected Western officers to be stationed at the Joint Trial Public Office to record the English confessions of criminal cases. The two who were selected were Mr. Hui and Mr. 58 Sandao Tou. However, Mr. Hui was diligent and hardworking and was soon promoted to deputy constable. After the recovery, the Public Office was managed by the Engineering Bureau on behalf of the bureau. The internal reorganization established the Procuratorate, with Mr. Hui as the acting prosecutor. In the 16th year of the Republic, the Public Office was taken back and reorganized into a temporary court. Mr. Hui was appointed as the chief clerk. On April 1st of last year, the temporary court was changed to the Special District Local Court, and a Chinese person was appointed as the chief clerk. Mr. Hui was transferred back to the Police Department by the Engineering Bureau and appointed to his current position. Because he is getting old and his service period has exceeded the Engineering Bureau's regulations, he can retire. It is reported that he plans to resign and return to England next month.</p>

<p>Outstanding Loans Exceeding 3.7 Million</p>
<p>Plaintiff's Lawyers Present Seven Requests</p>
<p>Court Orders Precautionary Attachment of Gong Fa's Assets</p>
<p>Yao Zhao-di Clarifies He Does Not Represent Huang Chu-jiu</p>
<p>Pan Zhao-bang Reports on the Possibility of Taking Over Various Shops</p>
<p>Following the declaration of liquidation for the Rih Yeh Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department after the death of Huang Chu-jiu, over a thousand creditors, including Xu Pei-yuan, et al., jointly engaged lawyers such as Fei Xi-zhen, Bian Jia-lu, Dong Yu, Xu Yan-nian, Dong Chi, Chen Zhi-gao, and Yan Lu-qing, to file a lawsuit in the French Court. The court ordered accountants Pan Zhao-bang and Wu Cheng to safeguard the ledgers of the two entities. Yesterday, the court summoned the plaintiff creditors, who gathered in large numbers, creating a condition of</p>
<p>overcrowding. Representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau were also present to observe. Lawyer Bian stated that previously, his firm represented over one thousand one hundred seventy creditors, but now over one thousand more have joined, totaling two thousand fifteen households. He then presented the supplemental reasons, stating that the defendant, Rih Yeh Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department, attracted depositors with advertisements promising slightly higher interest rates than other institutions, thus deceiving the creditors into depositing their savings to earn a small return. However, the Rih Yeh Bank and the Amusement Savings Department, ostensibly savings institutions, actually used the large sums of cash absorbed for other business ventures, including the Gong Fa Company's hot spring bathhouse, Jiu Fu Company, Chinese and Western pharmacies, the Sino-French Pharmacy, and five other establishments. In addition, Huang Chu-jiu personally managed countless other businesses under his own name. Accountants have found that Huang Chu-jiu embezzled over 1.05 million from the Rih Yeh Bank, as evidenced by reports. Recent investigations reveal that Huang's family, represented by lawyer Tan Yi-gong, published a statement declaring that Chu-jiu had invited friends to form the Wan Chun Silver Syndicate, pledging all his real estate deeds as collateral to secure over 300,000 for the bank and borrowing an additional 50,000 from relatives. So, why does Huang still owe the Rih Yeh Bank such a large sum? It's clear that Huang's family is concealing private assets with the intention of not repaying the debt. Currently, his firm has the following requests: (1) Order Huang Zi-xian, Zhong, and Xian-yao to appear in court to settle the debts. (2) Rule that Gong Fa Company and its shareholders bear unlimited liability according to partnership business principles to settle the debts. (3) Precautionary attachment of all assets of Gong Fa Company's hot spring bathhouse, Fu Chang Tobacco Company, the Sino-French Pharmacy, and the Chinese and Western pharmacies to prepare for repayment of debts. (4) Seize all assets of Huang Chu-jiu's personally run Huang Jiu-zhi-tang, Huang Long-tai, and Jiu Fu-tang, etc., to prepare for compensation. (5) Allow the plaintiffs' representatives to serve as members of the Gong Fa Liquidation Committee to comprehensively manage the company's currently operating businesses. (6) Allow the plaintiffs to reserve all losses suffered due to the Rih Yeh Bank and Great World Amusement Department's closure. (7) Order the defendant to bear all litigation costs of this case. Subsequently, Lawyer Huang stated, requesting that the court order the defendant to hand over the shareholder capital register to allow for future recovery of any deficiency from the shareholders. His firm has discovered the names of seven shareholders and submits them for review, with the names of other shareholders still under investigation and to be reported later. Lawyer Chen Zhi-gao also stated that the Great World Savings Department creditor representative Tang Sheng-de and others requested that the Great World Department's debt be handled separately from the Rih Yeh Bank's debt, because the Great World Savings Department is an affiliated agency of Great World, and its debt should be given priority by Great World. Therefore, future profits from Great World should also be enjoyed by Great World Savings Department creditors. Rih Yeh Bank creditors can also sue Rih Yeh Bank but cannot enjoy the same treatment. Lawyer Fei then rose to argue, stating that the Rih Yeh Bank and the Great World Amusement Department are the same agency and should enjoy equal rights. Lawyer Dong Yu also stated that now the members of the Huang Chu-jiu Aftermath Committee have mostly withdrawn, there needs to be an urgent approach to Huang's assets. On the surface, Gong Fa Company does own many assets, but in reality, they have already been mortgaged away, causing anxiety among the creditors. He requested the court to send someone to make an emergency disposition. Yao Zhao-di, the representative lawyer of the Rih Yeh Bank manager, stated that during the last hearing, the women creditors pointed to his firm, saying that he should not represent Huang Chu-jiu, wanting to bite him to death as soon as he went outside. Fortunately, he realized this and waited a long time before leaving, finally returning home safely. In reality, his firm does not represent Huang Chu-jiu but represents the bank manager Chen Zhi-quan, which is a misunderstanding on the part of the plaintiff. Today, his firm does not dare to strongly oppose the plaintiff's lawyers' opinions. However, he also knows that the plaintiffs are all honest people who have been tricked by Huang Chu-jiu's cunning scheme. The case needs to be resolved from the root, and Huang's assets have already been sealed up to prepare for future deficiencies. He requested permission to send personnel to supervise the liquidation. His words today are very fair, and he requests the creditors to understand and not repeat the behavior of last time. Finally, accountant Pan Zhao-bang stated that during the last hearing, the court ordered his accounting firm to safeguard the Rih Yeh Bank and the Great World Amusement Department and report within three days. Due to the time constraints, he has already reported the general situation. The actual debt of the Rih Yeh Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department totals over 3.7 million, and the amount loaned out also exceeds 3.7 million. However, there is very little cash on hand, and all of it has been loaned out. As for whether Huang's estate can be used for compensation, he requests that the court directly manage the assets to cover the deficiency. Then, the responsibility should be placed on the shareholders. The judge asked accountant Pan, "What is the accountant's opinion on how to resolve the debts?" Pan replied that many shops are already being considered for takeover, and if successful, the amount would be quite substantial and could be distributed first. As for the profitable shops, such as Great World and the Sino-French and Chinese and Western pharmacies, they should continue to operate to allow for further distribution of debts. Judge Gong Xiang ordered that the Gong Fa Company's assets be seized as a precautionary measure and prohibited the transfer of Huang's private assets. He ordered accountants Pan and Wu to immediately liquidate the accounts and report back for further review.</p>
<h3>日夜銀行事件</h3>
<p>The Rih Yeh Bank Incident</p>
<p>The Municipal Government to Take Responsibility</p>
<p>Organize a Committee for Public Handling</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Expected to Continue Maintenance</p>
<p>Following the declaration of liquidation for the Rih Yeh Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department, due to disagreements among Huang's family and the Gong Fa Company's board of directors, and with some creditors filing a lawsuit in the French Court, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiao-lai, and Wang Yan-song withdrew from the Huang Aftermath Handling Committee, causing the debt settlement and aftermath affairs to come to a standstill. This matter is of great importance to the livelihoods of the middle and lower classes of society, and it is by no means an issue solely for the French Concession. The French Court cannot independently shoulder this responsibility. It is heard that the Municipal Government, fulfilling its responsibilities, has decided to take responsibility for handling this matter. In the future, it plans to organize a committee with representatives from the Special District Court, the French Court, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Huang's family and creditors may also attend and participate in the discussions. The nature will be completely open, so that the interests of both parties can be taken into account and a fair resolution can be reached. Mayor Zhang Qun met with Yu Qiaqing yesterday to discuss this matter, urging him to continue to do his best for the sake of the livelihoods of tens of thousands of civilian depositors. Yu has already agreed, but on the condition that the Municipal Government maintain and handle the aftermath. Therefore, it is no longer a problem. According to reliable sources, in addition to issuing a portion of cash, the remaining depositor savings will be repaid in installments or issued with equivalent shares.</p>
<h3>浦江籌建鐵橋</h3>
<p>Planning to Build an Iron Bridge Over the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works Summons the Promoters for a Discussion Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the plan to build an iron bridge over the Huangpu River, the promoters Yao Ji-zhong, Xu Qing-wen, Gong Zheng-fang, and others submitted drawings to the Municipal Government, which ordered the Bureau of Public Works to review them. Yesterday, the bureau sent a letter inviting the promoters to discuss the specific plans, including the construction project and the required funding, to clarify the truth so that it could be reported back to the Municipal Government. The main points of the discussion were: The bridge project is vast and requires a huge amount of money. The focus of the construction project is on materials, a large portion of which will be supplied by the German Meng A-si Bridge Company Xi Wang Steel Plant. The plant has renowned experts in building iron bridges in Europe and America, and it is very confident in the promoters' plan to build the iron bridge as one of the construction projects of Greater Shanghai and is willing to support it with its strength, agreeing to advance the bridge materials and repay the principal and interest of the materials in annual installments after the project is completed. The basic terms of the material supply have already been agreed upon by both parties. The company has signed a written certificate with the promoters and has submitted it to the Municipal Government for review and verification. The formal contract will be executed after the Municipal Government approves the order. On one hand, the promoters will share over 200,000 yuan as the necessary expenses for the start of construction. If this is insufficient, more can be recognized. The bridge construction plan, contract rules, etc., will be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval to send personnel to supervise, so that all facilities in the project are considered together to achieve the effect of official-civil cooperation. The promoters intend to request the Municipal Government to file the case first and send personnel to guide the project, which will be easier to carry out. It is heard that the original promoters have already submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3>五月上旬將有</h3>
<p>Rare Comet to Appear</p>
<p>Calculations by Two Astronomers</p>
<p>This spring and summer, a rare comet will appear in the sky. Since its discovery in 1913, this is the first time it has crossed the solar system again. Its closest approach to the sun will be between May 7th and 9th, at which time its distance from the sun will be about the same as that of Mars. Its shape appears to be a collection of asteroids, so it was initially mistaken for an asteroid belt. Later, after repeated observations by astronomers, it was discovered that there was a fog accompanying it, which confirmed that it was a comet. Its orbit has been calculated separately by Dr. Crommelin, President of the Royal Astronomical Society of England, and Professor Peace Bullock of the Observatory of the University of Chicago in the United States, and the dates they predicted for its return to the solar system differed by only one and a half days. This was once a beautiful story in the astronomical world, because with the infinity of the universe, there are a total of 120,000 comets, and this comet must pass the solar system once every 18 years. The results of the two people's calculations were so consistent that their attainment is indeed beyond the reach of ordinary astronomers.</p>
<h3>薛寳寳訴産案開審</h3>
<p>Trial Opens in Xue Bao-bao's Property Lawsuit</p>
<p>Lawyers on Both Sides Debate Yesterday</p>
<p>Court Orders Both Parties to Appear in Court Themselves</p>
<p>The case of Xue Wang A-mei, representing Xue Li-quan's own daughter Bao-bao, suing Gu Qiao-lin and Xue Sun-shi, Xue Jin-sheng, Jia-sheng, Yan-sheng, Gen-sheng, etc., for fraudulent compromise in the French Court, which was a sensation in Shanghai for a time, was summoned yesterday afternoon. First, Lawyer Lin Ying-qing, representing the defendant Xue Sun-shi, stated that the subject matter of this case belongs to one case. According to civil law, a matter cannot be heard twice. Moreover, this case was originally filed by the plaintiff Xue Gu Qiao-lin and was resolved by mutual compromise. Now there is evidence of compromise to submit to the court. The plaintiff's claim is inappropriate and should be rejected. Lawyer Pan Cheng-e, representing the plaintiff, stated that this case was actually filed by Gu Qiao-lin posing as a legal representative. By the time the real representative Wang A-mei learned of the case and filed a lawsuit, it had already been compromised. In short, the real representative is a woman with limited knowledge, and Xue Bao-bao is still in swaddling clothes. How could the filing of a lawsuit by someone posing as a representative be known until the trial began? The lawsuit was filed immediately and is appropriate. The agent Wang A-mei lives in the same place as Gu Qiao-lin and had a relationship with the late Xue Li-quan at the same time. Gu Qiao-lin had no children, but the agent Wang A-mei gave birth to this daughter, named Bao-bao. He requested that the Li-quan Villa be attached first and ordered the two parties to appear in court in person, so the truth will come out. Lawyer Lin Ying-qing also stated that when this case occurred, it was reported in the newspapers, and everyone knew about it. Why didn't the plaintiff come to file a lawsuit at that time? If two cases can be heard, the defendant will not be able to bear being sued in the future. Judge Gong ordered both parties to appear in court in person for further questioning and verification.</p>
<p>[P Qingyun Lane Demolition Appeal Case Heard to Conclusion&gt;</p>
<p>Awaiting Scheduled Sentencing</p>
<p>Regarding the demolition dispute in Qingyun Lane on North Sichuan Road, reports in various newspapers have been commonplace for several years. More than ten tenants, including Miao Du-lai, etc., having failed in their lawsuit against Xing Ding-cheng of the New Sassoon foreign firm, have again engaged lawyers Xue Jia-qi and Wang Zu-xun to appeal to the Higher Branch Court, demanding that Xing be punished for an appropriate crime and compensate for losses of approximately 4,000 yuan. Yesterday, the case began hearing in the Second Branch Court of the High Court. Du Sheng-fang, who testified in the first trial, claimed to be from Zhongchu County, Guangdong Province, 40 years old. The judge asked what he did for a living, and Du replied that he was the secretary of the Guangdong Miscellaneous Goods Trade Union Association. (Judge) Do you know Miao Du-lai? (Du) I don't know him. (Judge) Is he a fellow villager? Du said he didn't know. The judge asked if he knew about the house demolition on September 10th of last year. (Du) I know. The judge then ordered Du to describe the demolition process. Du said that on the morning of September 10th, he went to the Chongming Road intersection and saw many people blocking the area. The appellant Xing Ding-cheng was talking to foreigners, but he didn't know what they were saying because he didn't understand Chinese. Later, the foreigners entered Qingyun Lane. The judge asked where he lived, and Du replied that he lived in Guangxing Lane on the same road. In August of last year, a friend wanted to take over a house, and a pharmacy was looking for someone to take it over. He went with his friend to inquire. He heard that the houses there were going to be demolished, but the shop owner replied that they were not being demolished. He then went to the landlord, the New Sassoon foreign firm, to ask if the houses there were going to be demolished, which is how he became acquainted with Xing Ding-cheng. Xing Ding-cheng claimed that Du Sheng-fang's words were not true. He did not know English, so how could he talk to foreigners? At that time, Wang Fu-shang, the attorney representing the appellant Xing Ding-cheng, rose to ask Du, "Is the Guangdong pharmacy on Chongming Road the one your friend wanted to take over?" Du replied, "Yes." Attorney Wang then said to the court that Du's testimony was inconsistent. During the initial trial, Du testified that he himself wanted to take over the Guangdong pharmacy, but now he says that his friend wanted to take it over. Du Sheng-fang then said, "The initial trial was held to determine whether the pharmacy was the one I wanted to take over or the one my friend wanted to take over. I did not admit that I wanted to take it over." The court then ordered the appellant's attorneys to declare the grounds for the appeal. The two lawyers, Xue Jiaqi and Wang Zuxun, stated eight reasons for disagreement, saying that during the first trial, the appellant's side had two witnesses, Yan Jinyun and Du Tengfang. Du did not live in Qingyun Lane, and Yan was a tenant of the third house and had no connection with the appellant's side. Their testimony should be reliable. They are now requesting that the first-instance judgment be overturned and the appellant be punished with an appropriate crime. Xing's attorneys Wang Fushang and Chen Zhongyin successively rose to refute the reasons given by the appellant one by one, saying that even if the appellant had to sue, they should sue the New Sassoon Foreign Company, which had nothing to do with Xing Dingcheng. Xing was not on the scene at that time and knew nothing. Finally, Judge Song Yuan declared that the debate in the case was over and that the sentence would be announced on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>小孩拾鈔案</h3>
<p>Child Finds Money,</p>
<p>Dismantling Gang Unaware of Exact Amount,</p>
<p>Money Left with Court, Remittance Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>Su Bao-gen, a Ningbo child residing at No. 330 and a half on Arthur Road, found a packet of banknotes and foreign currency totaling over a thousand yuan on the sidewalk in front of the Universal Theater on East-West Huade Road at approximately 3:00 PM on December 26th of last year. After he took it home, neighbors learned of it and plotted to divide 500 yuan, but they failed. They negotiated at the Yile Tian Teahouse and were arrested by the police. The case was transferred to the Special District Court, which sentenced the five people plotting to divide the money, including Lu A-ding, to 30 days of detention with a two-year suspended sentence. The 1,005 yuan was deposited pending a claim, as previously reported. Some time ago, the loser of the money made a report to the police to claim the money, but the police suspected that the loser was not a normal person because the money packet was very dirty, which may be related to other cases, and the payment had not been made yet. Yesterday afternoon, the loser accompanied the police to the court, where it would be issued after the court had tried the case and made sure it was real. The third court opened at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, with Judge Cheng Shang-feng questioning and summoning the child Su Bao-gen, his mother Su Liu-shi, and the five convicted, including Lu A-ding, for questioning. Su Bao-gen described the circumstances of the pick-up, saying that he picked up a packet of banknotes wrapped in a handkerchief at the entrance of the Universal Cinema at 3:00 PM on the 26th, the amount of which he did not know, and that he took it home. Lu A-ding and others said they did not know the exact amount of the banknotes. The loser stated that the money was actually 1,020 yuan in foreign currency and about 4 or 500 yuan in transportation expenses. The rest were from the Chinese and Industrial banks. He had sold his house at home to raise money to buy dowry for his daughter. He came to Shanghai specifically to purchase this. He lost the money at around 3:00 PM on the 26th after getting out of a rickshaw and paying the fare as he passed the Universal Cinema. He did not know until he discovered it was missing and went looking for it but someone had already picked it up. The judge asked if there was any evidence of the house sale and the loser replied that there was. At this point, the court also summoned the Hongkou Police Station Bao Tan to present the circumstances of the arrest of Lu A-ding, etc. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the exact amount of money picked up was 1,500 yuan, or 1,020 yuan, or 1,005 yuan. It is still difficult to determine at present. The police are honestly afraid that the loser is not a legitimate person or that it is related to other cases. Can the court postpone the return of the money to the loser pending further investigation by the police? The judge agreed to postpone the retrial.</p>
<h3>三千里尋子</h3>
<p>Seeking a Son Three Thousand Miles Away</p>
<p>Xu Ke-li Meets Son, Overjoyed and Saddened</p>
<p>Charitable Society Sponsoring Disaster Children's Return Home</p>
<p>In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), the China Children's Relief Association sent personnel to Shandong and other areas to collect disaster children and send them to orphanages for education. Later, as they grew older, they were successively sponsored to return to their hometowns. Those who had no home to return to or whose families could not support them were still left in various orphanages, which were supported by the association. Some time ago, Xu Ke-li came to the association to visit his son Xu Ke-xing, claiming to be from Chaocheng, Shandong. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, locusts caused a disaster. He and his son begged for food to Taian, where they met the association's vice president, Mrs. Guo Bing-wen, who was collecting disaster children. He handed his son over to the association to be brought to Shanghai for education. Now, two years later, his son has grown a little, and his father is old and longs for his grandson. He took three months to walk three thousand miles to Shanghai to the association's headquarters. After the association checked the case and found that it matched, the disaster child Xu Ke-xing was being raised at the Longhua Shanghai Orphanage and was already a third-grade student. Two staff members, Zhang and Wang, were sent to accompany Xu Ke-li to meet his son, and they were overjoyed and saddened. They then returned to the association together to inquire about how to take care of the child. He said that his father was longing for his grandson and wanted to take him back to reunite with him, but he was currently out of funds and could not set off. The association, moved by his journey of three thousand miles to find his son and considering that the child could not travel long distances, made an exception and bought tickets for the father and son to send them to the bus station yesterday to return home for a reunion.</p>
<h3>滬西四百餘所五聖廟拆毀</h3>
<p>Over 400 Five Saints Temples in Western Shanghai Demolished</p>
<p>The three districts of Pu-song, Fa-hua, and Cao-jing in western Shanghai originally had over 400 Five Saints Temples. The Municipal Party Department had previously sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting that the Municipal Public Security Bureau's six districts, one, two, and three, work with the municipal commissioners of each district to demolish them within a time limit. Later, due to misunderstandings among the villagers, strong obstruction, and various difficulties, it was not possible to realize this temporarily. The municipal commissioners of each district, such as Yang Xin-zheng, etc., went to each village to advise them and explain in detail the necessity of eliminating superstition and that there was no need for the existence of the Five Saints Temples. Now that the order to demolish them has been received, you cannot use excuses to obstruct and violate the law. Therefore, over 400 Five Saints Temples in the western Shanghai area were demolished in unison the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>昨日淞口大霧</h3>
<p>Heavy Fog at Songkou Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 4:00 AM, after the rain stopped at Wusongkou, a thick fog gradually rose on the sea surface. After 9:00 AM, it became even thicker, and the Three Gorges waters were a blur, and the navigation lines could not be distinguished. The whistles and bells on the ships were continuous, and they temporarily stopped sailing to avoid danger. The lighthouse also temporarily emitted light to guide the lost. When the fog was at its thickest, three or four sailing ships successively hit the Songkou East Stone Ridge by mistake, and the bows of the ships were damaged. It was not until 2:00 PM that the fog slightly subsided, and merchant ships began to raise anchor and exit from the Pujiang River. Merchant ships entering and exiting also sailed from the Three Gorges waters to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>清晨盜匪路刦</h3>
<p>Robbers Robbed on the Road Early in the Morning</p>
<p>Rickshaw Company Owner Robbed</p>
<p>Detectives Capture One Thief on the Spot</p>
<p>Hu Rong-wang (43 years old, from Taizhou), the owner of the Wanxing rickshaw company at No. 12 Haichang Road, Zhabei, was carrying 434 yuan in foreign currency yesterday morning at 8:10 AM and was riding in a rickshaw to the concession vehicle donation office to donate a license when three robbers suddenly flashed out at the entrance of Xiajia Lane and blocked his way. One robber took out a pistol from his sleeve and aimed it at Hu's chest, warning him not to make a sound, while the other two robbers took Hu to the entrance of the lane and forced him to hand over the money. Hu, terrified by the weapon, had no choice but to obey. After robbing the money, the robbers ran away in a crowd. Hu, unwilling to have his huge sum of money robbed, pursued them closely and shouted "Robbers!" The detective team of the Fourth District General Office, Heng Guan-lin, Zhou Gui-cai, and Li Zong-nian, was passing by and bravely captured a robber and found the stolen money. Just as they were about to pursue the remaining robbers, one robber fired two shots in a row. The detectives, fearing injury to passersby, did not return fire, and the two robbers escaped. They took the captured criminal back to the team for questioning. Zhang Zhi-xiang, from Funing, 30 years old, residing at No. 40 Jiantili, confessed that he, Cui Gui-qi, and a man surnamed Chen discussed robbing the rickshaw company owner's money this morning at the Dayang Bridge. It was a inside job, and Chen Bang-gui came up with the idea. The pistol was supplied by Chen, who is still at large. The detectives, together with Police Chief Chen Rui-tai, went to arrest Chen, who claimed to be Xiao Tianzi, from Funing, 36 years old, and was in charge of repairing tires at Hu's place. A few days ago, my old man Lu Jin-kang wanted me to find a way to get 150 yuan to hand over before the 5th of this month. I had no way to do it for a moment, so I came up with this plan. Commissioner Qu said that the robber was so bold as to rob in broad daylight and that his actions were extremely illegal. In addition to sending the captured criminal to the judicial section, he ordered his subordinates to strictly arrest the escaped thieves and investigate the matter.</p>

<h3>市清道由公安局試辦</h3>
<p>City Cleaning to be Handled by the Public Security Bureau on a Trial Basis</p>
<p>In addition to supervising the street cleaners to sweep the streets, the Municipal Health Bureau must also strictly prohibit residents from arbitrarily dumping garbage in order to maintain the cleanliness of the road surface. In order to facilitate the responsibility of the police in charge of the area, the Municipal Government was requested to submit a proposal to the Municipal Council to follow the example of Guangzhou, Tianjin, Beijing, and other cities and change to the Public Security Bureau to be responsible for a six-month trial period. It was originally scheduled to be received and put on trial from January 1, 20th year (1931), but because the Public Security Bureau was not ready, it was changed to February 1st. All cleaning expenses, personnel, and workers have been changed to be under the control and supervision of the Public Security Bureau. The bureau has reported the handover trial situation to the Municipal Government for the record.</p>
<h3>市衛生局防疫忙</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau is Busy with Epidemic Prevention</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau's promotion of free vaccinations for smallpox during the winter and spring seasons is already one of its busiest tasks. Now, due to the severe epidemic of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis in Zhejiang Province, several people in the city have also been infected. The Central Government has also ordered it to allocate special personnel to assist in extinguishing the epidemic. The city has also approved groups of 30 people to submit written requests to send personnel to inject epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis prevention vaccines free of charge. Groups such as the San You Industrial Society Factory have applied to send personnel to inject preventive injections free of charge in recent days, totaling more than 4,000 people in the past three or four days. Vaccination is also very busy, with over 66,000 people having been vaccinated. Therefore, the bureau feels particularly busy with epidemic prevention matters, and it is difficult to handle it all.</p>
<h3>靜安寺路一帶有三大地産易主</h3>
<p>Three Major Properties in Jing'an Temple Road Area Change Hands</p>
<p>Most to be Renovated</p>
<p>In recent days, three major properties in the Jing'an Temple Road area have changed hands, with a total transaction value of 3.32 million taels, which is a major event in the Shanghai real estate industry since the beginning of the year. One is located at the northeast corner of the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road, covering an area of approximately nine mu, which was purchased by a number of Chinese for 920,000 taels. The other is the current site of the Naval Club at the southern end of Jing'an Temple Road, located between the Ma Road intersection and the Chengdu Road intersection, covering an area of approximately five mu, which is heard to have been sold for over 400,000 taels. The third is the transfer of the original Carlton site last Saturday, which was purchased by American capitalists for 2 million taels. In addition, there are also a large number of properties for sale in the vicinity, but inquiries to reliable sources have not been verified. After these properties change hands, it is expected that most of them will be renovated, so the Jing'an Temple Road area is expected to undergo a major transformation in the next few years.</p>

<h3>Returned Student from the United States, Cheng Jingyuan</h3>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Cheng Jingyuan, courtesy name Shimin, a native of Zhejiang, has studied in the United States for ten years and is now returning home on the Canadian Empress. He is expected to arrive in port this morning. Mr. Cheng first studied engineering at Columbia University and obtained a Master of Science degree in mining.

<h3>A Divorce Case Resolved Again</h3>
<p>Xia Yao's and Xia Jingen</p>
<p>Xia Jingen, who lives at 120 Muir Road, has been working as a "xizai" (a derogatory term for a young apprentice or servant) at 790 Baochang Road. Now he is unemployed at home and does not engage in proper work. His wife, Xia Yao's, has hired lawyer Shi Lin to file a complaint with the Special District Court, requesting a divorce from Xia Jingen. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, Judge Cheng Shangfeng opened the third hearing.</p>
<p>Judge: Xia Yao's, why do you want a divorce?</p>
<p>Xia Yao's: Because my husband, Xia Jingen, is unemployed and idle. Not only does he not provide food and clothing, but he also frequently abuses me. I have injuries to prove it.</p>
<p>Judge: What do you do for a living?</p>
<p>Xia Yao's: I work as a female worker in a silk factory.</p>
<p>Judge: Xia Jingen, what do you do?</p>
<p>Xia Jingen: I work as a "xizai."</p>
<p>Judge: How old are you?</p>
<p>Xia Jingen: Twenty-six years old.</p>
<p>Judge: How old were you when you married Xia Yao's?</p>
<p>Xia Jingen: Nineteen years old.</p>
<p>Judge: Are you childhood sweethearts?</p>
<p>Xia Jingen: Yes.</p>
<p>Judge: Do you have children?</p>
<p>Xia Jingen: Yes, three children.</p>
<p>At this point, the judge said, "You are childhood sweethearts and have lived together for eight years and have children. In my opinion, it is better not to divorce."</p>
<p>Xia Yao's said, "I want a divorce because he doesn't provide food and clothing and beats me. How can I live like this?"</p>
<p>The judge said to Xia Jingen, "You should take good care of your wife and not abuse her. Why do you beat her?"</p>
<p>Xia Jingen replied, "I give her money, but she uses it to gamble in 'huahui' (a type of lottery). I have not abused her."</p>
<p>The judge said to Xia Yao's, "Why do you gamble in 'huahui'? Gambling in 'huahui' is illegal, do you know that?"</p>
<p>Xia Yao's replied, "He himself also smokes opium."</p>
<p>The judge said sternly, "You are both not good people. Why do you gamble in 'huahui' and smoke opium?"</p>
<p>The judge asked, "Xia Yao's, do you have any other requests?"</p>
<p>Xia Yao's: I want him to provide food and clothing.</p>
<p>Judge: How much money do you want?</p>
<p>Xia Yao's: Forty yuan per month.</p>
<p>Judge: Anything else?</p>
<p>Xia Yao's: Nothing else.</p>
<p>The judge then said to Xia Jingen, "Take her back and treat her well. Divorce is not good." He said to Shi Lin, the plaintiff's representative lawyer, "This case cannot be prosecuted. You should mediate a reconciliation for them."</p>
<p>Shi Lin asked the judge to postpone the hearing to allow for reconciliation outside of court. The judge agreed and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Prostitutes Suffer from Gangsters Extorting Money</h3>
<p>An Anonymous Letter Appealed to the Chief Patrol</p>
<p>Chen Diwei Arrested for Investigation</p>
<p>Cantonese prostitutes in Shanghai have traditionally congregated in the Hongkou area. Birds of a feather flock together. This area is not only a gathering place for Cantonese prostitutes, but also the residence of a large number of Cantonese immigrants in Shanghai. As a result, some Cantonese people who do not engage in productive labor often demand "fees" from Cantonese prostitutes, otherwise they cause endless trouble. Those who suffer initially endured in silence because they had nowhere to complain. Recently, they have been sending anonymous letters to the chief patrol, requesting that it be stopped. The chief patrol received another such letter the day before yesterday, stating that Chen Diwei, a Cantonese man living at 661 North Sichuan Road, has recently been extorting money from Cantonese prostitutes at 481 Peng Road. The chief patrol forwarded the original letter to the responsible police station, ordering them to arrest Chen. He was handed over to the Special District Court yesterday, where Judge Feng interrogated him. According to police lawyer Li Zhishan, a Cantonese prostitute named Miao Lin was previously lured to the Moon Palace Hotel by these people for not paying the fees and threatened with a pistol, eventually being extorted of 100 yuan. Miao Lin was summoned to the police station yesterday and stated that it was not the defendant in this case who did it. However, two prostitutes from Peng Road, Zhan Sheng and Yan Ping, confirmed that on the evening of the twelfth of last month, Chen, along with two others, extorted 20 yuan from them. The two prostitutes further stated that at 3:00 PM on the twelfth of last month, the defendant and two others came, claiming to be impoverished and asking for dozens of yuan in loans. When they refused, they insisted on staying, so they each gave them ten yuan. Chen confessed to knowing the two prostitutes and having invited them to drink, and that he had borrowed 20 yuan from them because he was suffering from syphilis and needed treatment, and that there was no intimidation. Judge Feng ordered the defendant to post a 300 yuan bond for a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>Wang Decai, a native of Jiangbei, is 56 years old and lives at 334 Yihe Lane, Huaji Road. He makes a living by selling candy. His son, Wang Xiaotao, is 17 years old. Yesterday afternoon, Wang Xiaotao went to see a play at the nearby Huaiyang Theater. When he returned at dusk, he bought two pufferfish. After returning home, he cooked them with his father, Wang Decai, for dinner. Soon after, the father and son both felt severe abdominal pain and fainted on the ground. They were immediately taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, Wang Decai was too severely poisoned and died at 8:30 PM that evening. His son, Wang Xiaotao, is also in critical condition.</p>

<h3>That Girl</h3>
<p>— Yu Xi</p>
<p>At the Entertainment Show</p>
<p>At that entertainment show, the two children who participated in the performance were the most noticeable.</p>
<p>One was the boy who played the coach in "Eight Good Students." He wore a paper-pasted top hat, a suit, riding breeches, and leather shoes. He had a figure-eight mustache drawn on his cheeks. He held a stick and gesticulated as he spoke to the audience. His speech was clear and fluent, and his demeanor was solemn and comical. He was a performance talent who was quite promising.</p>
<p>The second was the girl who played "Little Parrot." She had a small figure and wore a green dance costume. Her permed hair was tightly bound by a rhinestone headband, revealing an adorable rosy face, like a little fairy painted in a picture book.</p>
<p>According to their principal, Miss Ge, they were siblings.</p>
<p>Parents who have such children are truly worthy of pride, I thought.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>After the girl finished performing, she stayed by the side to watch. She didn't go backstage to warm up by the fire. In this cold weather, I watched her, and she had a naive smile on her face. I asked her, "Aren't you cold wearing such thin clothes?"</p>
<p>"I'm not cold," she said. "I have to perform again in a while."</p>
<p>"Ah, you'll freeze. Your mother will scold you," I said deliberately. "Shall we go warm up by the stove?" I took her hand and walked into the dressing room, squatting by the stove to warm up. She didn't seem to be afraid of strangers at all.</p>
<p>I asked her many questions. She answered that her surname was Yu and she was twelve years old. Her brother was two years older than her. Then I asked, "Is that your brother?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have two brothers. I have another one who studies in middle school."</p>
<p>Their principal, Miss Ge, came in. The principal seemed to love the child as a mother loves her daughter. Yes, she had gained a lot of glory from the child. Everyone said that the child was so well-behaved because they taught her so well.</p>
<p>The principal ordered her student in a motherly tone, "Nannan, say hello to Mr. Zhang."</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang," the child was very obedient.</p>
<p>"Haha, I've never seen such a lovely child," I praised in front of the principal.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your praise. This child is naturally charming and lovable," Miss Ge said to me with delight. "Look at her eyes." Yes, I had already noticed her eyes. Her eyes were round with long eyelashes. Her black pupils were lively and shining, emitting a sharp light. They were a very touching pair of eyes.</p>
<p>The principal also told me how good the child's grades were at school, how obedient she was, and how much the teachers liked her. The child, hearing these praises in front of her, lowered her head shyly and tied her shoelaces. The principal came over to tidy up her slightly messy hair, saying, "It's almost your turn again."</p>
<p>She performed a second time. I watched her. I just wanted to watch her dance.</p>
<p>She carefully shook her head, bent her hands, and raised her feet, singing in her mouth. Many other children who were not participating in the performance harmonized with her voice, so it was hard to hear her clearly.</p>
<p>After the performance, she jumped in, the innocent smile still floating on her face. She said she was a little cold. She went in and put on a big child's coat and continued to squat by the stove. I looked at her. I stroked her permed hair. I asked her who permed it for her.</p>
<p>"That hair will be straight if you just soak it in water," she answered, not answering the question directly, but full of innocence.</p>
<p>I squeezed her hand again. I said her hand was thin, but she said,</p>
<p>"Mother said that it's not good for little girls to be strong..."</p>
<p>When their program was over, they left. She was wearing a French hat with tassels and a crimson little cheongsam, jumping happily, holding hands with another big child. She didn't say goodbye to me at all. She left.</p>
<p>—In front of a friend's house—</p>
<p>In the days that followed, I often thought of that child.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, one afternoon five days later, I would meet that child again in front of a friend's house in the town. It was exactly the child who played "Little Parrot" at the entertainment show a few days ago.</p>
<p>This time, she was wearing simple clothes, and the rosy rhinestone hairband on her face was gone. However, her eyes were still the same touching eyes as before, and her smile was also the same one that made people love to watch her. She was feeding a child sitting in a stroller, and two girls slightly younger than her were standing next to her.</p>
<p>I asked her who those people were.</p>
<p>"Those two are my sisters."</p>
<p>"You have two younger sisters?"</p>
<p>"I have two younger sisters and two older brothers. I'm in the middle."</p>
<p>"What about this one?" I pointed to another girl slightly younger than her and asked.</p>
<p>"She's my cousin, and those two are my sisters," she explained clearly.</p>
<p>"Then your home is near here?"</p>
<p>"No, in Dalian."</p>
<p>"..." She said "Dali", I don't understand.</p>
<p>"Dalian, you have to take a boat to Dalian," she said solemnly.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dalian, then have you been to Dalian?"</p>
<p>"I lived there for seven years."</p>
<p>"Why did you come to Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"My dad wanted to send me to Shanghai to study."</p>
<p>"Where's your mom?"</p>
<p>"Mom is coming here with us."</p>
<p>"Then you can often come to my place to play. It's very close, do you know the way?"</p>
<p>"I often pass by your place when I'm riding in a car."</p>
<p>"You often pass by, why don't you come in?" I rebuked her. She couldn't think of a reason to answer. She was silent, but I didn't want to leave her. I wanted to think of something to talk to her about, but I had to come back because of another worry. I said to her, "Come tomorrow, okay? I have a phonograph there."</p>
<p>Without waiting for her reply, I left. I looked back at her. She was fighting with the other children for something. She didn't look at me. I hurried back.</p>
<p>After that, I never met her again. Of course, she wouldn't come to my place to play. However, the impression of her still cannot make me forget. I hope that under the loving care of her mother and the joy of her teachers, she will live her happy childhood.</p>
<p>Although these happinesses are impossible for me to seek even in dreams.</p>
