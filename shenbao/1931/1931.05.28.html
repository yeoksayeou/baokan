<h3>葉楚傖之備荒意見</h3>
<p>新法育蠶已見成效</p>
<p>積極籌劃備荒專欵</p>
<p>建設與救荒可兼顧</p>
<p>昨日（二十五日）上午九時省黨務整理委員會在該會大禮堂舉行紀念週到該會委員楊興勤張淵揚祁錫勇省政府代表葉楚傖及該會全體工作同志主席楊興勤行禮後由主席介紹省政府主席葉楚傖報告省府最近工作情形演詞如下主席各位同志過去的八九天中省政府方面没有什麽重要問題可報告各地也没有什麽重要大事情不過在將來恐怕有很多問題值得我們來注意的所謂未雨綢繆委實覺得有無限的憂慮啊今天先報告一件事情同時也是要向省黨部諸同志和全省同志提出的一點請求今天所要報告的便是今年的收成問題去年差不多可算是大熟而今年則不然便是大荒將來會影響到治安問題農村經濟等等一切事業至重且大如果我們不能挽回這個大荒的厄運那本省各方面將來所要感到的困難更非言語可以形容的了時光過得很快忽忽五月下旬明媚的春光已和我們作别誰也知道蠶桑工作已告完了講到蠶桑在今年的收成實在太可憐因爲雨水太多氣候太冷的緣故結果只好抵到去年十分之一因此農民商人均受極大的損失無形之中江蘇的生産力減縮了不少在此人人聞此消息而疾首蹙額的當中還有一些可聊以安慰哩</p>
<p>新法育蠶便是養蠶種桑採用新法之成功據農鑛廳何廳長說我們養蠶種桑向墨守土法如果今年用了土法來養蠶怕要完全失敗幸而採用新法還能獲得抵到去年十分之一的成績新法養蠶蠶室内置火盆備寒暑表等等使得室内空氣不致有過冷過潮過煖過燥之弊因此很得農民信仰這麽看來農民採用新法來養蠶種桑將來定可推行無阻易於普遍將來採用新法之後而没有像今年多麽特異的天氣那末蠶桑的收成比較過去的收成當然有增加的把握今年的蠶桑事業已是失敗了再看看所謂小熟的麥怎樣呢兄弟每次坐在車中一路向窗外瞧瞧見有許多低田的麥已淹没在水中就是不爲水淹的也是短小的短小稀疎的稀疎眼見小熟也打折扣又見報載江北民衆要求開壩向來在五月裏没有要求開壩這回事的等到八九月夏汎漲時才要開壩目前的情狀已是如此那到八九月間夏汎一漲其危險程度將如何也可想而知</p>
<p>米價高漲這個雨水太多的影響已經及於白米的價格在一月之前糙米八元一石到了市塲上不過十元一石而現在米價已超出十二元之外並且有繼長增高之勢當米價没有漲時有人問爲何米價不漲是否因米多之故其實江蘇人口三千萬所産白米那裏能夠這麽許多人吃那末不漲的原因在什麽地方便在看今年的秋收如何今年秋收好的話米價不會漲的如果秋收不佳米價就會漲高據說一般米商從他們歷史的經騐認識是很正確現在一般人見到這雨水太多的影響及於今年的秋收難望豐收爲當然之事於是把米囤而不糶者大有其人把米收買起來的也大有人更有偷偷摸摸的販運出口的哩</p>
<p>禁米出口省政府原定標準米價現已超過便應停發運米出口的護照原來省政府准米出口的意思因米價已賤農民受其損害故准運出口使米價不致過賤而農民可以多少獲得一點利益然而目前米價已漲過標準價格護照雖然停發甚而至於禁米出口恐怕照江蘇交通四達的地方旣有海口更有防不勝防的河道又有上海要絶對禁止不偷運誰都不敢保險大家知道一般商人的利益往往和待賤米吃所衆的希望相衝突的在政府方面祇能盡人事之力至於要救濟這個天然的歉收其效能便很難表現出來今年逢到這個大難關</p>
<p>治安堪虞如果事前一些没有準備地方上的治安便難保得着農村經濟破壞土匪增加起來更是一個共黨復來的機會於此足見秋收不佳影響到各種事業並且江蘇的財政將没有辦法財政旣無辦法庶政均將停滯古人說民以食爲天實在可以說一切都以食爲天政府覺得目前固然境内無事可是未來的大難將臨不可不先有準備倘然臨到口渴方才掘井還來得及嗎乘此尙有三四月的準備時期急起直追努力想法也許多少可以挽救一點省政府現有一個比較可以解决危險的工作便是積榖去年由民政廳認眞做了一下各縣過去積榖的狀况據詳細調查可分三等一積有米榖的縣很少二積有榖欵的比較多一點三積榖欵很少有的簡直没有更有連藏榖之倉都没有的經省政府見到便切實注意一下各縣能切實做去現在到很有幾縣把榖儲藏起來至於積有榖欵的比較多些至少限度也積些榖欵而把積榖的倉修葺完整起來這個積榖問題倘能多做一點也便是危險程度减少一點同時想到省政府財政之困難已達極點固然由於辦法未盡善致被徵收人員中飽這是行政上的一種缺點同時也是環境使其然的</p>
<p>籌欵備荒省政府仍想積極籌劃一筆欵項來做備荒之用暫時雖没有把握但是遲早是要實現的再如建設經費定有的欵用之於建設而不能移動的也不能拿建設經費來做備荒之用不過兄弟以爲利用這筆建設經費而做備荒之虞使得旣不礙於建設事業而更有益於備荒之用雙方兼顧均收其利這便是以工代賑比如做這件建設事業原擬雇工人三百名三年可用現在多顧没飯吃的工人六百名一年成之那末此六百人到那時便不至於鬧飢荒了推而至於全省的建設事業都如此辦法其效果定有相當表現出來的上面這避荒的三條路省政府當竭其能力以赴現在省政府旣去努力做這個避荒工作同時也想使民間第一步是明瞭這個大難將臨了民衆旣明瞭之後第十泊使他們也準備起來好在江蘇各種民衆團體都已成立比較的辦事便當得多大家都起來未雨綢繆那衆擎自然易舉</p>
<p>備荒運動最好由省黨部領導下級黨部做一種備荒運動因爲許多人對此大荒的危險還是不知不覺更有許多人想利用此時機作生利發財之捷徑而惟恐荒災之不來這般人要黨部同志去喚醒轉來無論如何總要使他們覺悟了也來努力於備荒之工作以分任一點政府所不能解决的困難更希望黨部同志要爲人民做幾件事情比如備荒一事人民本不知不覺我們就同他們喚醒起來同他們計劃起來同他們帮助起來大家都準備充足到了危險境界而可安然渡過所謂有備無患那末人民一覺悟其力量非常之大其對於黨同志的信仰當然也非常之大黨同志獲得民衆信仰便是獲得民衆力量了</p>

<h3>四大學英語辯論花絮錄</h3>
<p>— 徐綺城女士</p>
<p>四大學英語辯論向例每年舉行一次加入者有光華復旦交通曁南等校本年辯論分兩組先行預賽題爲「中國應否向美國貸入生銀借欵作國内建設之用」結果交大復旦獲得决賽權二校復於本月二十三日下午舉行最後競賽地點假交大文治堂評判員如陳霆銳顔福慶郭伯良嚴恩槱等並皆一時碩彦三時起賽五時畢事其間妙趣横生不可以無記</p>
<p>三位蜜絲　向例四大學辯論極少女同學參加即偶有之亦不過一二人而已惟本年度英語辯論兩校競賽員不過六人而蜜絲竟有三位適佔半數女權澎漲信乎今非昔比矣</p>
<p>幾幅圖表　此次復旦代表爲求獲得最後勝利起見特繪製三幅表解一爲中國債票表一爲中國存銀表一爲上海地産價值表皆用竹布彩色繪製精巧絶倫可見該校遇事不苟努力研究之一斑矣</p>
<p>石破天驚　交大朱耀貞女士爲該校之傑出演說人才昨今兩年在校際比賽中無不第一此次本其天才發爲正論言銀借欵之切要娓娓動聽且英語流利姿態老到洵屬不可多得</p>
<p>如話家常　復旦代表梁培澍女士於江大講壇上尙係初露頭角惟態度之佳音調之美實爲罕見最後以二問題反質對方時一種安詳大雅之表情萬非忸怩作態者所可企及且講時滔滔不絶如咳珠唾玉在在令聽者忘倦說者謂梁女士之演講其姿態神情如與家人圍爐閒話家常云</p>
<p>春風滿面　復旦代表尙有王保敏女士王女士年齒尙穉雙辮分披兩肩極玲瓏嬌小之致尤可貴者即女士講時除音調悅耳外並時時面帶微笑天眞爛漫女士有焉</p>
<p>援古證今　名律師陳霆銳氏是日爲評判員之一衆旣講畢主席黎照寰氏邀氏致詞氏於是大發宏論謂中國最缺乏辯論人材在昔戰國時之蘇秦張儀雖能憑三寸不爛舌使六國南面事秦然不過與諸侯個人之談話非公開演講也孟子亦自命爲辯論家嘗曰予豈好辯哉不得已也顧孟子之辯僅與各諸侯卿相而已亦非演講可比三國時有諸葛亮亦善擅長口才惟範圍仍極狹故中國人材雖多於此道尙不多見其原因不外言文不一致言語不統一無合羣生活無民主政治等今日各演說家咸能駕儀秦孟子諸葛而上之實爲中國辯論人材之開山鼻祖云一時聞者無不軒渠</p>
<p>女生包辦　未幾主席宣布競賽結束計第一名爲復旦梁培澍第二名爲王保敏第三名爲交大朱耀貞最奇者妈首三名悉爲女生包辦於是銀杯銀盾等皆由三女士於歡騰中一一領去衆皆鼓掌以祝賀之蓋四大學比賽以來此種成績爲往昔所無也</p>
<p>握手言歡　出會場後交大朱耀貞女土即趨前與梁王握手互示欽佩之意和靄之忱藴於言表一時環而觀者如堵皆嘆其態度光明爲不可及焉</p>

<h3>未來世界（一）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>話說一天晚上我在酒邊燈畔冥想着未來的世界這個未來世界不過除了過去現在而言所以一刹那間我就想到未來世界一位朋友他的别號呌做天不虚生他是大學裏的格致家他說你的未來世界就是我的現在世界我在過去一刹那中已經把衣食住行四大問題改革了一番所以現在我的衣服與衆不同穿在身上會得冬暖夏凉一年四季不用換得也不用洗若是惹了灰塵只用鷄毛帚擋一下就好若是定要洗時只用在雨中一淋馬上就可揩乾晚上睡下也不用脫也不用被褥帳子不怕蚊蟲蚤虱來叮就是蒼蠅也站不住脚你道是什麽材料做的說來也很平常就是「玻璃紗」的「無縫天衣」大家應該都耳熱能詳不過我的玻璃紗並不是有名無實的我起初是用鈉玻璃來做絲因爲質地太硬容易破碎因此改用鉀玻璃來做成極細的人造絲一般起先是用鋼管來做毛細管的後來知道玻璃的熔點雖則很高但是用着極微的容量迅速地在毛細管中壓榨出來他的潛熱不多金屬傳熱不及正和槍砲裏放出子彈一樣因此我把鋼管換了砲銅結果很好但是銅價很貴我想燒玻璃的坩鍋原是養化鎂做的因此我就把做牙粉的炭酸酸鎂煆成了養化　來做毛細管果然滿意得很竟把玻璃絲做得很光很細我所用的炭酸鉀本來是外國進口的因爲太貴我就改用榨油廠的棉子殻來代替煤塊燒着玻璃燒出來的棉子殻灰我就拿來泡湯把灰汁燒乾便成炭酸鉀了很是便宜起初還怕棉子殻的容積太大積堆不起後經實騐每方尺可容廿磅方丈之室就可容得十噸他的燃燒力每用廿磅可以使得常温中的二百零五磅水升至攝氏百度發生蒸氣用到四十磅時可使完全化汽比較煤屑要省因爲煤屑一磅只能使三磅半水化汽二號煤屑要十三元一噸棉子殻每擔八角雖要貴上四角四分一噸但是每噸殻子可得百十二磅的灰浸出的灰汁可以提出三十多磅的炭酸鉀來就值四兩多銀子呢鉀玻璃是軟玻璃加了一種石棉質的纖維進去所以做成人造絲後就用圓筒織機來做衣服穿着很是伏帖在冬季裏能夠保護體温不使外散風雲縱大却和隔着一層玻窗一樣並不覺冷不過夏天的日光射着有些難受而且透明的不甚雅觀因此我又改良了幾次</p>

<h3>吳崑吾</h3>
<h3>談法公廨事</h3>
<p>乃撤銷而非改組及收回</p>
<p>因該公廨本係法方自置</p>
<p>撤銷上海法租界會審公廨交涉經我國政府派定司法院參事吳崑吾外交部歐美司長徐謨法方派定法公使館參贊萊加爾滬法總領事甘葛林四人爲交涉委員後迄已月餘尙無開始交涉確期茲悉我方交涉委員吳崑吾於日前因事來滬</p>
<p>參觀法廨　吳君於昨日上午命駕至法租界薛華立路法會審公廨參觀由承審官朱奇龔湘唐在禮三君迎接吳君入客廳茗談片刻旋即陪同至第一第二兩法庭及檢察處參觀一週始興辭握手而别新聲社記者特往造訪茲錄其關於此項交涉情形之談話於次</p>
<p>撤銷公廨　據吳氏告記者法公廨交涉不能謂之改组亦不能謂之收回蓋改組或收回其意實含有該法庭原爲我有被人侵佔後現在欲將其改組或收回之意現查法公廨并非我國所設實法方自置故下稡欲將其撤銷而另由中國設立法庭也</p>
<p>談判時日　記者詢以開始談判日期據答現雖尙未確定然亦爲期不遠至該交涉之所以延未能開始談判者實因法方交涉委員萊加爾參贊一時未能胆來蓋法使魏禮敦氏自南下來京談判法權後法使館之一切事務均由該參贊代理法方雖派該氏爲交涉法公廨委員然牽於使館事務未能即行來滬大約俟法使回平後該氏即可南來開始談判矣</p>
<p>將來組織　記者復詢以該公廨撤消後辦法及其將來之組織據答依政府之意見俟撤銷後另設一新法庭内部組織即完全依照中國最新法律及法庭辦法組織之但將來交涉情形如何現尙不能預卜故關於撤銷後之辦法及其内部弸織之情形仍須視將來交涉之程度如何而定</p>
<p>公廨略史　關於滬法公廨之過去情形據吳氏談法公廨實與前之公共租界内之會審公廨不同蓋前公共租界會審公廨係我國政府設置外國領事得出庭會審故其交涉時曰改組或曰收回法公廨則不然該法庭原係法方自設内中有中國法官亦係法方聘請并非我國政府委派其最初時因法租界地方甚小無法庭之設立遇有民刑訴訟等事則僅在法領署之會客廳内辦理時清廷尙派有法官常川駐内殆至一千九百十四年法方因與北京政府訂立條約將法租界範圍擴大法領始設立法庭以至於今已將二十年中政府迄未過問現在國民政府急擬將其取銷而另設純粹之中國法庭云</p>
<h3>長江華輪近訊</h3>
<p>繼續休航　在本月十七日滬上華商江輪應派第一批停班者計招商三北各兩輪又通揚班輪兩艘又令寗紹快利等休航分赴贛漢等埠載兵赴前方剿匪</p>
<p>留船應班　各輪公司爲供應客商需要向交通處磋商結果另調上游綫水輪兩艘來滬應班致長江一路中國船旣减太古怡和及日清之進出口貨乃突然起色</p>
<p>客貨阻滯　此次旣派各輪載運大批客貨來滬行至九江因奉令赴漢致船内貨件悉被阻滯其他各公司輪之已預定艙量噸位客貨配齊候裝忽而停班致遭擱阻者各客家發電來滬向公司交涉者日必數起云</p>
<p>浦口管理總部交通處處長邵煒昨發通告知照本埠各輪局大致謂調用船舶已經本處特派楊熾中君並浦口組織船舶管理處此次應調商船統歸浦口主持即租金應付亦歸該處辦理本處居於監督地位希各輪局逕向該處接洽可也故今次休班入湘之船多已先到浦口聽候指揮云</p>

<p>取消宰費　鮮肉同業公會昨函市商會云謹啟者屬會因屠稅糾紛雖蒙鈞會調解解决並規定稅票實價三角其餘九分再由監委令指配用途但敝同業方面因無明白宣佈疑　不釋再有租界同業所繳之宰前費及内地同業所繳之宰後費實爲敝同業意外之痛苦又</p>

<p>有四鄉之技士費爲四鄉同業徧担之苛稅久爲全市同業一致反對在公理上言敝同業旣繳　稅己符一物一稅宗旨而宰前宰後費巳屬額外苛征且加以四鄉技士費在法理上尤欠公允敝會爲同業生計及弭同業糾紛起見不得不請鈞會關懐商艱據情轉請市府即將宰前宰後費及四鄉技士費一律即日取消以彰公　而示體恤不勝迫切待命之至</p>

<p>公益事業　滬南北曁四鄉鮮肉同業因市府允准在屠宰稅中酌撥公益經費而管理委員會尙未成立且用途不明昨日又紛往公會内要求公開經常務委員戎乾初說明公益經費係備施材殯舍肉商及宰作工友義務子弟學校之用且預備滬南北寳出市鄉上海市鄉各備一舍並阖告往財政局請願經過情形各會員相遂散</p>

<h3>Central Political Conference</h3>
<p>Unified Tax Treasury Bills Approved in Principle</p>
<p>Deadline Set for Submission of Central and Local Budgets</p>
<p>Next Year's Mongolian and Tibetan Education Expenses Approved</p>
<p>Nanjing, the Central Political Conference held its 273rd meeting on the 27th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek resolved the following important cases: (1) The draft "Regulations for the Protection and Encouragement of People's Investment in Construction Projects" proposed by the Ministry of Industry was handed over to the Economic Group for review. (2) Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi's request to establish a Rationalization Research Committee for Industry and an Industrial Standards Committee, along with a proposed charter and budget, was handed over to the Finance and Economic Groups for review. (3) The budgets of all central ministries must be submitted to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics by June 10th of this year. Local budgets from all provinces and cities must be submitted separately by June 30th of this year. (4) Fifty million yuan was approved for Mongolian and Tibetan education expenses for the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. (5) The budget for the 19th year of the Republic [1930] for the National Agricultural, Mining, and Industrial Enterprises, both categories, as well as the Audit Department, the Palace Museum, Nanjing City, and other entities, was approved. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, the first item discussed at today's Central Political Conference was the Ministry of Finance's proposal to issue 80 million yuan in unified tax treasury bills for the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. The result was approval in principle, and it was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation.</p>
<h3>Chiang Expresses Views on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>A Draft is Being Prepared for Release</p>
<p>Nanjing, Chairman Chiang will make an important written statement on the current situation, exceeding one thousand words. The draft was completed tonight and may be released on the 28th. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Regarding the Central Government</h3>
<h3>Still Favors Peace with Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Bandit Suppression Plan Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Li Shizeng Comes to Shanghai for Discussions</p>
<p>Nanjing, according to important sources, all Central Committee members favor resolving the Guangdong issue through peaceful means. As a last resort, legitimate defensive measures may be taken. A large force will be stationed in southern Hunan to promote the realization of those who hope to establish a separate regime and to facilitate the work of clearing out communists in Hunan Province. Troops will also be selectively deployed to the Zhangzhou and Xiamen areas in Fujian Province to secure coastal defenses. Military affairs in Jiangxi Province will continue to follow the previously determined third-step plan without any changes. Full salaries will be issued immediately to stabilize morale. The rumor that several divisions will be transferred from Jiangxi to other locations is false. Furthermore, as of 6 PM today, the true situation in Guangdong Province, as revealed by telegrams, is still unclear. A telegram from Zhang Ji, arriving from Hong Kong, only reported his itinerary and did not mention the situation in Guangdong. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Li Yuying went to Shanghai by train on the 27th to continue mediating the Guangdong situation and maintaining peace. He is expected to confer with Wu Tiecheng and others. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, a certain important person in the Northeast said that the Guangdong affair is purely the work of military men and politicians with no way out. The recent situation is unlikely to escalate, and the North is currently very stable. Guangdong, as a corner, would certainly not dare to take action. I believe that it can be completely resolved through political means in the near future. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan, Shanxi Generals Are Indeed in Favor of Peace Regarding the Current Situation</p>
<p>Taiyuan, the Provincial Party Headquarters decided to issue a notice warning Chen Jitang in Guangdong</p>
<p>Nanjing, according to foreign sources, a telegram from Guangzhou indicates that Chen Jitang has not yet finalized an agreement with Zhang Fakui and the Guangxi faction. The content is as follows: Chen originally proposed that Guangdong allocate 800,000 yuan per month to Zhang Fakui's army and 1.6 million yuan to the Guangxi army, but Zhang and the Guangxi army must enter Hunan from Guangxi and cannot pass through Guangdong territory. Zhang Fakui stated that since they are cooperating, there is no need to specify the amount of aid, but he must first return to Guangdong to establish a base and said he is willing to serve</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>in protecting Guangzhou. Chen Jitang did not agree. It is also reported that many communists have arrived in Hong Kong to await opportunities for action. The Third International has instructed the Communist Party to place Guangzhou under the control of proletarian forces as soon as possible. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Northern Situation is Stable</h3>
<p>Ji Yiqiao Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Fu Zuoyi and Others Will Go to Beiping</p>
<p>Beiping, Ji Yiqiao said that if the Guangdong faction forms a government, war may be unavoidable. The North is completely aligned with the Central Government, and the war will not spread. Vice-Chairman Zhang Xueliang went to Nanjing a few days ago to express support for the Central Government and dispel rumors. The Vice-Chairman has no doubts about Shi Yousan and Sun Dianying; they have no disagreements with him. Shi Yousan is indeed ill. He will come to Beiping to meet the Vice-Chairman after he recovers. Shi's army has about six divisions. The Vice-Chairman advocates implementing reductions in force. Shi is reluctant to reduce the number of soldiers due to years of camaraderie.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Situation Between Finland and Russia is Serious</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from Copenhagen today, a serious dispute may occur between Finland and the Soviet Union. The situation between the two countries has become tense. Seven Russian warships recently sailed near Finland to demonstrate their power. In addition, two aircraft flew over the Finnish territory of the Teijo Islands, circling threateningly. It is also planned to hold army exercises in areas bordering Finland within days. Some observers believe that Russia will begin military action. The cause of this matter is the long-standing irreconcilable differences between the ideologies of the people of the two countries. Recently, since the Finnish farmer Lappo's anti-communist movement began, diplomatic relations have become increasingly dangerous. Therefore, the impact may easily affect the peace in Europe. We should not regard it as a matter of a corner of Northern Europe and ignore it.</p>
<p>Since Finland left Russia and became independent, it initially had border disputes with Russia. Then, because the Russian Communist Party received funding from the Third International to conduct propaganda activities in Finland, although the workers in its industrial areas mostly expressed sympathy, the majority of farmers actively expressed opposition. As a result, communist propaganda and anti-communist movements have been going on continuously, brewing for longer and deeper hatred. During this time, instigated by religious figures and provoked by politicians, it gradually mixed with the political movement, resulting in Finland's internal unrest every day. Finland often suffered from the abuse of the Russians, and Russia also repeatedly warned Finland for oppressing the Communist Party. Therefore, since Lappo launched a large-scale anti-communist movement, the relationship between Finland and Russia has long been on the verge of danger. The current European situation is intertwined with complex disputes. When a problem arises, it often affects the overall situation. Therefore, we believe that the current problem between Finland and Russia is the most noteworthy.</p>

Two aircraft searched the area and found oil on the surface. The water there is 600 feet deep, making salvage difficult. The submarine is one of Soviet Russia's largest, with approximately forty to fifty officers and men on board.</p>

<p>International Labor Conference Opens Today</p>
<p>Russia Proposes Economic Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<p>Intention is to Cover Up the Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 26th: German Foreign Minister Curtius, in his capacity as Chairman of the League of Nations Council, announced today that the 12th General Assembly of the League of Nations is scheduled to be held on September 7th.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 26th: The International Labour Office Governing Body, as the 15th session of the League of Nations Labour Conference will open on the 28th of this month, specially convened the Governing Body today to expedite all preparatory matters for the conference. It is reported that as many as forty-five countries have joined this Labour Conference. The most important of the matters for discussion is the uniform working hours of miners. Norway and Argentina, which had never previously participated in the Labour Conference, have also decided to send representatives to participate this time.</p>
<p>Paris: Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov proposed the conclusion of an "Economic Non-Aggression Treaty" in the Pan-European Committee. According to opinions in Paris, this is a diplomatic tactic by Russia to cover up its five-year economic and agricultural development plan. If other countries sign this non-aggression treaty, they will not be able to take measures, either individually or collectively, to protect themselves against Russian dumping and other economic aggression strategies. As this opinion is gaining traction, it is feared that the Russian proposal will be difficult to pass. However, an American correspondent gave it a favorable name, calling it the "Kellogg Economic Pact," which may influence American public opinion to support the Russian proposal, but the French side does not think so.

<h3>Salary Reduction Order Announced in Japan</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Wakatsuki Issues Statement</p>
<p>Opposition Movement Dissipates</p>
<p>Left-Wing Incitement of Railway Workers to Strike Fails</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 27th: The Imperial Edict regarding salary reductions for government officials has been approved by the Emperor and was announced at 1:00 PM today. The main points are as follows: (1) Salaries will be reduced for civil and military officials with monthly salaries of 100 yen or more. (2) The reduction standards are: 20% to 10% for officials appointed by the Emperor and Imperial appointment, 10% to 6% for officials appointed by recommendation, and 10% to 3% for officials appointed by approval. (3) Professors' salaries at Imperial and national universities will be reduced according to the above standards.

(5) Reduction methods: Higher officials will be paid according to the new salary scale, and lower officials will be paid according to the transitional salary scale. (6) Local treatment staff, public school staff, and those with similar standards will have their salaries reduced according to the same conditions and extent as government officials. (7) Pension system: Military officers are not related to salaries and will not be treated the same as civil servants; appropriate measures will be adopted.

(9) Travel expenses and travel allowances will be considered later.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 27th: The outcry against salary reductions, which seemed to be developing seriously 24 hours ago, has unexpectedly subsided. Government officials who had prepared to resign have now changed their minds and apologized for causing unnecessary trouble. Even members of the judiciary, who claimed to be legally protected from salary reductions, are now discussing voluntary donation of their salaries. The police acted swiftly, arresting 34 inciters, so the railway strike failed to materialize. With the promulgation of the salary reduction edict this afternoon, the entire dispute over salary reductions appears to have ended.</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 27th: Prime Minister Wakatsuki entered the palace at 4:30 PM yesterday to report on the cabinet's decision on the salary reduction plan. After the Prime Minister left, the government issued a statement in the Prime Minister's name, the main points of which were as follows: Recently, due to internal and external difficulties, the government had to reduce various expenses in the compilation of the budget for the 7th year of Showa, as it was impossible to avoid increasing the burden on the people without reducing expenses. Therefore, the government is currently preparing to reorganize administrative finances and the tax system. The salary order has been revised, and investigations have been drafted, so it is starting with this and reducing salaries is unavoidable. It is hoped that everyone will display a spirit of sacrifice and endure the pain for a while. The government will do its utmost to fulfill its responsibilities in implementing other policies.</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 27th: Some railway operation staff were resentful of the compromise plan. The operation staff of the Kamata, Otake, and Higashi-Kannaga car depots have submitted their resignations. Extreme left-wing elements believe there is an opportunity to exploit, and last night issued a radical directive in the name of the Mobile Control Headquarters, ordering a general strike to begin on the 27th. The operation staff believed it was a directive from the headquarters, and the situation suddenly became urgent. Vice-Minister of Railways Aoki reported to Police Superintendent Takahashi by telephone, and at the same time sent the Director of Operations and the Chief Secretary of the Secretariat to the Metropolitan Police Department to request vigilance. After careful discussion, the Metropolitan Police Department summoned Yoshida, the Director of the Tokyo Railway Bureau, at midnight and ordered him to take strict precautions. The Ministry of Railways prepared to suppress the strike if necessary. From midnight, all permanent staff were persuaded one by one. As a result, apart from a small number of extreme left-wing elements, the majority remained quiet and served.</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 27th: Tsumori Shinjo, 30 years old, a representative of the operation staff of the Osaka Railway Bureau who attended the National Operation Staff Conference, was angry and despondent over the implementation of the salary reductions. Yesterday, he committed suicide by cutting his abdomen with a razor in the railway bureau dormitory. He lost a lot of blood, but his life may not be in danger.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Sovereignty of Greenland</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Oslo, 26th: Denmark claims sovereignty over the entire island of Greenland, but the Norwegian government has raised objections to this matter. The Norwegian Arctic Committee has requested the government to declare that sovereignty north of Scoresby Sund should belong to Norway because the first inhabitants of the area were Norwegian hunters. The committee's reason for submitting this request to the government is that Danish exploration teams have been making various preparations in eastern Greenland.</p>
<p>Swiss Professor</p>
<h3>Ascends Directly to the Clouds in a Balloon</h3>
<p>Plans to Make Scientific Measurements</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 27th: Professor Piccard, in his specially made balloon with a sealed, airtight lead chamber suspended below, flew the Swiss flag and ascended from Augsburg at 3:56 this morning. About a thousand spectators cheered him on. Piccard expects to rise to an altitude of 16,000 meters within four hours, stay for two hours in the upper atmosphere to make scientific measurements, and then descend. The balloon initially ascended very quickly, diagonally to the northwest, and then changed direction to the southeast at about 1,000 meters. Later, at about 7:00, it was seen passing over the eastern end of Lake Constance, crossing the Austrian border, at an altitude of about 8,000 meters, heading southwest and south. As it rose higher, it became no longer visible. Piccard is scheduled to land at 11:00, but it has not landed at that time and is probably still rising. Whether it can reach the planned altitude depends entirely on the weather. The landing place is likely to be on the southern foothills of the Alps.</p>
<h3>New York Securities Trend Downward</h3>
<p>Stimulated by Short Selling</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 26th: Securities prices continued to trend downward, even for well-known securities. The securities exchange authorities are very concerned about this, so they sent questionnaires to brokers to inquire about various details regarding short selling by the brokers themselves and their clients. This is seen as a preliminary step towards stopping or limiting large-scale short selling plans, because the recent decline in securities prices, even if not caused by short selling, has certainly been stimulated by it.</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Jin Provincial Government</h3>
<h3>Raising a Grain and Provisions Donation of 4 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>All Counties in the Province Listed in Ten Classes of Apportionment</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Jin Province is land-poor and its people are impoverished. Since troops from various armies, both national and local, have gathered since last year, the military has no funds to pay for the troops, and the provincial government has no way to raise funds. Therefore, the authorities temporarily stipulated a purchase method, ordering the counties where the troops are stationed to requisition locally. Last month, Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan and others, in their capacity as military leaders, ordered the counties to borrow grain and provisions once, but this was stopped due to opposition from various parties. Recently, the people in the counties have been exhausted. The troops are on the verge of starvation, so letters and telegrams urging for payment are pouring in like snowflakes. The general supervisors of the Yuncheng and Jincheng supply depots have also repeatedly telegraphed urgently. After discussions with various parties, Shang Zhen finally proposed a method for borrowing grain and provisions at yesterday's provincial affairs meeting, which was passed unanimously and ordered to be implemented in all counties. The original proposal, the amount of the loan, and the county grades are recorded below:</p>
<p>The original proposal: "According to repeated telegrams from General Supervisors Du Zhongquan and Zhang Guangjian stating that the counties have paid excessive amounts for the purchase of provisions for friendly troops, and the accumulation of debts has exhausted the local resources, resulting in refusal to purchase provisions and the danger of cutting off supplies, please allocate a large amount of funds to relieve the urgent situation. While under investigation, we also received telegrams from counties such as Gaoping and Changzi stating that no payments have been made for the purchase of grain and provisions, and they cannot continue to support it, please approve and issue repayments. Furthermore, a telegram was received from Jincheng County stating that more than 200,000 yuan was owed for purchases before March, and merchants were pressuring guarantors to file lawsuits, which could not be handled. From May 1st, the county magistrate will not be responsible for any delays if there are no funds to purchase. In addition, telegrams were received from gentry and merchants in counties such as Quwo, Wenxi, and Yongji, stating that the grain and provisions are exhausted, the troops are in an uproar, order is on the verge of chaos, merchants are already deeply in debt, and the people are being burdened to the point of ruin. We implore the government to consider the overall situation and order counties that are not garrisoned to provide assistance separately or maintain the original agreement for all counties in the province to apportion grain and provisions to avoid imbalance and ensure fairness. Upon examination, the statements made by the county magistrates, gentry, and merchants are indeed the actual situation. If proper assistance measures are not taken, the supply of provisions will be cut off, which would be disastrous. In order to equalize the burden on the people and maintain local security, it is proposed that the provincial government immediately telegraph all counties in the province to raise a grain and provisions loan of 4 million yuan to provide relief. The funds required by each county for the purchase of provisions for friendly troops will be allowed to be retained from the loan to reduce the provincial government's difficulties. After the arrears of military pay are received from the central government, they will be repaid in full. We ask whether this is appropriate. Enclosed is a detailed list of the amount of the loan allocated to each county, which is submitted to the general meeting for public decision."</p>
<p>County grades and burdens: First grade: 7 counties, 113,332 yuan per county, with the exception of Yangqu County, which is 113,608 yuan, totaling 793,600 yuan.

<h3>Kang-Tibetan Disputes and Qinghai Politics</h3>
<p>Conversation with Guanbao Fangren</p>
<p>Our country's border affairs have traditionally suffered from isolation due to inconvenient transportation, and it has not been easy to obtain detailed information about the recent Kang-Tibetan disputes. I recently met with Ang Guanbao Fangren, a hereditary chieftain of the Tangute people of Qinghai. According to his account, the background and current situation of the Kang-Tibetan disputes in Qinghai are roughly as follows: "Since leaving Qinghai, I have traveled through Tibet to reach Beiping, arriving in the capital more than nine months ago. Therefore, I am not very clear about the ultimate situation of the Kang-Tibetan disputes, but I vaguely know that the general origin was the expansion of a dispute over a small lama into a military affair. Baishu Temple on the Kang side has repeatedly made concessions, but Dajie seized the opportunity to advance. The Dalai Lama has repeatedly tried to stop this matter, but Dajie has continued to advance his troops in defiance. Tang Kesan, the mediator sent by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, has arrived in Chengdu and has consulted with Liu Wenhui, the Commissioner of the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense, several times on mediation methods. Generally speaking, the Tibetan side is not likely to oppose much. The people of our province hope that peace and tranquility will be restored as soon as possible so that various construction projects will not be interrupted. In my opinion, the best solution to this dispute is for the Dajie and Baishu temples to each abide by their respective territories and not fight over anything. Both sides should unite in friendship and jointly promote Buddhism, and no longer create any side issues. Since Chairman Ma has been in charge of our province, financial revenue has improved compared to before. The annual revenue and expenditure offset a deficit of no more than 5 or 6 percent. Education has also been vigorously promoted, but there are only two or three Chinese schools in the province. The provincial government is currently drafting various education plans to promote Chinese studies so that children can become familiar with the Chinese language and serve in domestic construction. Due to the difficulty of funding in our province, there are very few roads and railways. There are now plans to build a railway hundreds of miles long to facilitate transportation and develop commerce. The military discipline of the troops in our province is quite strict, and they treat the people very kindly, so the people respect and admire the soldiers. As for the Panchen Lama, the people of our province eagerly hope that he will visit Qinghai, so I have personally pleaded with him to visit Qinghai to preach the Dharma, and he has agreed. He will indicate whether or not he can go soon. My return date will depend on business matters, but I may be able to start my journey back to Qinghai in early June."</p>
<h3>Internal Strife Among the Southern Fujian Militia</h3>
<p>Chen and He Telegraph Requests for Suppression</p>
<p>Gao and Lin Troops Retreat in Defeat</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Although the various militia units in southern Fujian have been reorganized by the Security Department one after another, they still have disputes over tax revenue and defense areas and cannot tolerate each other. Recently, Gao Weiguo of Huian, Wang Hanmin of Dehua, Zhang Xiongnan, You Sifu of Datian, Lin Jizeng of Xianyou resented that Chen Guohui of Quanzhou (currently organized as the 1st Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army) relied on his strength and often put pressure on them. They were unable to endure this and gathered their respective regiments to resist jointly. It was agreed that Gao Weiguo would lead troops from Huian and Lin Jizeng would lead troops from Xianyou to attack Quanzhou to strike Chen's front, and Zhang Xiongnan would lead troops from Dehua and You Sifu would lead troops from Datian to attack Yongchun to strike Chen's rear. Upon hearing the news, Chen Guohui also urgently prepared countermeasures and decided to take an offensive posture towards Quanzhou and a defensive posture towards Yongchun (because the strength of You Sifu and Zhang Xiongnan's troops was weaker), and joined forces with He Xianzhu, the commander of the 8th District Bandit Suppression in Xinghua, to have his troops deal with Gao Weiguo and He's troops deal with Lin Jizeng. On May 15th, Chen and Gao's troops opened fire at Heshi, on the border between Huian and Quanzhou. On the 20th, He and Lin's troops also opened fire at Banqiao, on the border between Xinghua and Xianyou. Gao Weiguo and Lin Jizeng both retreated due to a lack of ammunition, one retreating into the Fushanya of Huishan and the other retreating into the Dazhen of Xianyou. Chen Guohui and He Xianzhu have both telegraphed the provincial government to report that they have occupied Heshi and Xianyou County and requested that an order be issued to suppress Gao and Lin in order to continue their attack. Currently, Lin Jizeng has entrusted someone to negotiate peace with He Xianzhu, willing to offer two machine guns as a condition for ending the war, while Gao Weiguo is still in contact with various units to plan another attack, so the situation in Quanzhou is still very tense. Recently, news was received that after Chen Guohui occupied Heshi, he sent Chen Peiyu's regiment to attack Fushanya in two routes. When they advanced to Lvbu, only 300 wu away from Fushanya, they were ambushed by Gao Weiguo in the mountains. The two sides are currently in a standoff. (May 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Lower Reaches of the Yellow River Suddenly Became Dangerous</h3>
<p>The Sunjiaba Revetment Collapsed</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Sunjiaba revetment, which belongs to the sixth section of the lower reaches of the Yellow River in Lijin County, is now facing a new and sudden danger. The current of the river has moved towards the bank, causing the revetment to collapse. The newly added inverted fish scale revetment and the inner ear revetment of the first revetment have collapsed severely. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the head of the sixth section, Ji Baoren, after receiving the report, instructing him to use the stones that have been transported as much as possible to protect the revetment, add straw, and strive to rescue it. He also ordered the head of the lower reaches, Liang Zongduan, to go and supervise it to avoid negligence. The report from the head of the sixth section, Ji Baoren, said, "To Zhang Qing, the director of the Jinan River Affairs Bureau, and Liang Jun, the head of the Yellow River: The foundation of the first revetment in Sunjia collapsed and then broke. I was honored to have you inspect the work the other day, and I was instructed to add a section of inverted fish scale revetment. Since you left after inspecting the work, I have supervised the construction of the inverted fish scale revetment. It was completed at 8:00 PM on the 20th, and the current scoured it away overnight. The embankment collapsed this morning, and the river beach in the middle of the embankment between the 31st embankment base and the first embankment file is collapsing rapidly. The river beach has collapsed more than three zhang in the past two days. The faster the embankment collapses, the more the revetments above the first embankment feel the pressure. After inspecting the situation, the revetment should be reinforced. It seems that throwing stones to protect the roots can勉續（勉勵繼續?) the danger of the revetment collapsing. Ji Baoren, the head of the sixth section of the lower reaches, respectfully reports." (May 26th)</p>
<h3>The Business Community of Hebei Requests the Abolition of the Production and Sales Tax</h3>
<p>The Chambers of Commerce of Pingjin, Tangshan and Baoding Unite</p>
<p>Presenting Petitions to Vice Commander Zhang</p>
<p>Forcefully Pointing out That the Production and Sales Tax is Actually a Disguised Likin</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The implementation of the special production and sales tax in Hebei has been going on for several days. Due to the opposition of merchants and residents in Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) and other places, there have been many obstacles to tax collection. From the date of implementation on the 21st to yesterday (24th), only a small portion of the revenue, about 1,000 yuan, has been collected in Tianjin. The tax bureau is actively handling the matter because it is under orders to implement the tax. The chambers of commerce of Beiping, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Baoding have decided to take unified action. Representatives of the Beiping Chamber of Commerce went to the Vice Commander's office on the 23rd to petition, but because Vice Commander Zhang was away, they only submitted the petition. Tianjin Chamber of Commerce Petition Representative 三陳楚</p>
<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>Ten individuals, including Xiang Zhao Zhenwu, led by Chamber of Commerce Chairman Zhang Pintiju and Standing Committee Members Wang Wendian, traveled to Ping on the 24th to petition Vice Commander Zhang to swiftly abolish the production and sales tax. They carried a petition which they presented to Vice Commander Zhang, which is recorded below: "We have found that since the abolition of lijin in Hebei Province, although the name of lijin has been removed, special consumption taxes have been introduced and levied in the same way as lijin. Merchants believe that since the customs tax rate has already increased, if this burden is added, the actual burden will be even heavier than the old lijin. We were about to seek redress, but fortunately the central government issued a clear order to stop the special consumption tax, and merchants were relieved from their difficulties. Unexpectedly, the authorities changed the special consumption tax to a special commodity production and sales tax. Although the name has changed repeatedly, the nature is still the same as lijin. The difference between lijin and tax is that one is levied repeatedly and the other is one tax per item. The original intention of abolishing lijin in our country is to follow the principle of one tax per item, so all taxes of a transit nature and those levied repeatedly are to be abolished. This is why the central government repeatedly ordered to avoid disguised repeated taxation and stopped the special consumption tax. Although Tianjin is a place where all kinds of goods gather, most of them pass through and are transshipped to other places. Tianjin is neither a production nor a sales location, but a production and sales tax is levied on the goods passing through. This is not only inconsistent with the name but also contrary to the meaning of abolishing transit taxes. Moreover, production and sales were originally the collection methods stipulated in the special consumption tax. Now that the consumption tax has been stopped, how can the name of production and sales exist alone? Isn't this considered a disguised form of lijin? Looking back to the luxury goods tax implemented by the Ministry of Finance in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the situation was exactly the same. At that time, our Vice Commander believed that the taxes levied were all daily necessities and considered them harmful to merchants and disturbing to the people. He telegraphed the ministry to request their abolition, and merchants and civilians are still very grateful to this day. The scope of the production and sales tax currently planned by the authorities includes oil, sugar, tea, cotton, jute, soybeans, medicinal materials, paper, textiles, fruits, livestock, and porcelain. Which of these is not a daily necessity? Which of these has not had its customs tax rate increased? Moreover, this tax has not been implemented in other provinces. If it is implemented only in Hebei, merchants will inevitably change their routes and move to other places. We are afraid that the tax revenue will not be effectively obtained, and the commercial port will be in decline. Quenching thirst with poison is what our Vice Commander will not take. This tax was announced and implemented the day before yesterday. The associations and others are very worried and have telegraphed separately, hoping for your wise judgment. Recently, the market environment has become more and more pessimistic, foreign merchants have been returning goods one after another, and there is no way to clear the backlog in the city. All industries are stagnant, and finances are in dire straits. If this continues, it will affect industrial relations even more importantly. This matter is urgent. In addition to specially recommending Chamber of Commerce Chairman Zhang Pintiju, Standing Committee Member Wang Wendian, and Standing Committee Member Wang Xiaoyan, together with industry representatives Bao Zhu San and others, to respectfully visit your office to express our sincere feelings, we are also submitting this letter to make clear our case. We humbly beseech your gracious consideration and swift decision. We await your orders with trepidation." (25th)</p>
<h3>Recent Defense Affairs in Wanyuan</h3>
<p>The General Reserve Army Headquarters Formulated Four Measures</p>
<p>Before the Lunar New Year last year, several robbery cases occurred in the city of Wanyuan. The main culprits have now been apprehended. It has recently been learned that the military police inspection team attached to the General Headquarters of the General Reserve Army Corps arrested more than ten individuals, including recruiting committee members Xia Chun and Sun Shaowu, at the Chunhe Hotel in Ximen Nei on the 25th. On the 26th, they arrested five recruiting committee members, including Liu Yongxiang, at the Han Clan Examination Hall in Huangjiashan in the city. All of them have been sent to the military court for trial. The headquarters believes that Wanyuan has been designated as the provincial capital's garrison area, and the defense is the responsibility of the Provincial Government Guard Regiment led by Hao Jiajun. Maintaining public order is of paramount importance. Yesterday, they formulated four measures and sent them to the provincial government for approval. The contents are as follows: (1) Maritime Public Security: After the abolition of the Maritime Police Department, no specific agency was designated to be responsible for maritime inspection, resulting in many cases of shirking responsibility. After the abolition of the Yangtze River Defense Command, there is no reliable defense of the Yangtze River. National defense is certainly beyond the capabilities of this province, but for the sake of security in the provincial capital, it is necessary to establish a maritime public security agency. If there are insufficient funds, boats should be allocated and the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau or the Shipping Administration Office should be responsible for both, but their powers must be clearly defined so that criminals cannot travel on the water without being searched. (2) Public Security in the Provincial Capital: The police district in the provincial capital is vast and lacks weapons, making it often impossible to exercise authority. Military force must be relied upon for assistance, but if the military force is divided, the garrison strength will inevitably be reduced. It is best to allocate half of the firearms to increase the inherent capabilities of the police themselves, so that the military strength will not be reduced, and the police will be able to assist the military. (3) Public Security Outside the Provincial Capital: Outside the police district of the provincial capital, the villages and towns in the county areas are often places where bandits lurk and gather. The county should be ordered to conduct a thorough investigation and form a defense regiment to implement the baojia system to prevent trouble before it happens. (4) Census: The census in the provincial capital has not yet been carried out, making it impossible to investigate the incoming and outgoing population. Even if bandits rent houses, set up agencies, and hide, it is impossible to detect them. The order should be transferred to complete the task within a time limit as a precautionary measure.

<h3>Anhui Civil Affairs Department Thoroughly Investigates the Lieshan Bandit Case</h3>
<p>The case of Lieshan Coal Mine Company in Suzhou County, Anhui Province, being suspected of harboring bandits has been reported previously in detail. It is now learned that the Anhui Civil Affairs Department telegraphed County Chief Wang of the county yesterday, ordering him to thoroughly investigate and reply. The original telegram stated: "County Chief Wang of Suzhou County: We have read the documents and telegrams from the county's Consolidation Committee, various urban and rural agencies, and various public organizations, stating that the county has been ravaged by bandits for many years, and only a few survivors remain after the villages have been reduced to ruins. The various armies and police forces have repeatedly suppressed them, only to have them return. The reason for this is that the Lieshan Coal Mine Company openly harbors and protects them. They usually disguise themselves as workers, gather in the coal plant, and then go out to rob. When they are successful, they run rampant in various places. When they are unsuccessful, they return to the plant to recuperate. Sometimes, when they are tracked and pursued to the vicinity of the mountain, they stop, run out of ammunition and food, and are extremely exhausted. After a few days, they are again loaded with ammunition and gather their strength to recover. Although the military and political officials know the reason, they are mostly hesitant because the mine belongs to national policy and the responsible personnel are mostly assigned by the ministry. Sometimes they enter the mountain to search, but they resist under the pretext of protecting the mine. For example, last year, when County Chief Wei and others captured the major bandit Zhang Zhengming in the mountain, they were intercepted by a line of people and eventually released him. There are many similar cases. More than a dozen pieces of evidence have been collected and will be reported separately, requesting that the responsible personnel of the mine be removed first and a way to solve the root of the problem be sought to protect the people's lives and ensure local peace. We are extremely grateful and await orders, etc. Based on this, it is imperative to thoroughly investigate and formulate a method to get to the root of the problem in order to pacify the area, as the Lieshan Coal Mine Company is harboring bandits, making it impossible for the army and police to suppress them. However, the details of the company's collusion with bandits and the original case of intercepting and releasing the captured major bandit Zhang Zhengming last year have not been reported by the county, making it impossible to investigate and seize them. In addition to telegraphically ordering the county to thoroughly investigate and report the facts, we will wait for the association and others to submit the evidence they have collected to the department for review before further handling it. We hereby urgently telegraph the county chief to thoroughly investigate and report the facts so that we can verify and seize them. Seal of Ma, Civil Affairs Department (May 27)"</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Zibo Coal Merchants' Strike</h3>
<p>Caused by the Manipulation of the Lu Da Company</p>
<p>Small Coal Merchants Request the Railway Bureau to Resume Transportation</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The article regarding the Zibo Zhangwei Coal Merchants' strike due to the Jiaoji Railway Bureau's increase in freight rates has been reported repeatedly in the past. The surface facts are generally well-known, but few outsiders know the reasons for this strike. According to someone familiar with the inside story, the coal freight rate of the Jiaoji Railway has been greatly reduced invisibly since the freight was divided into different levels. Even with the current 20% increase, it is still lower than the previous freight rate. This price increase is not a loss for the coal merchants. Moreover, the cost of coal is only ten yuan per ton, and with the freight, it is only more than ten yuan, but the selling price in Qingdao is more than twenty-five yuan per ton, with a net profit of about one time. The coal merchants' high prices have already caused great hardship to the people. The big coal merchants are still not satisfied and want to monopolize the Jiaoji Railway's coal transportation. Because they did not achieve their goal, they caused a strike to deliberately control the big coal merchants in Zibo and other places to sign a contract with a certain party in southern Shandong to supply one to two thousand tons of coal per month to that party. The big coal merchants used various means to force the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to allocate wagons every month to transport this huge amount of coal. The Railway Bureau submitted the situation to the traffic department for review. The department believed that this method was inappropriate because if the wagons were allocated to transport this huge amount of coal every month, the coal of other coal mines and merchants would have no wagons to transport, which would inevitably affect the business of small merchants and even lead to the bankruptcy of many small coal merchants and the unemployment of workers, which would have an impact on industry and society. Therefore, the Railway Bureau did not approve their request, and the big coal merchants' monopoly plan failed. They had no choice but to use the opposition to the freight increase to cause a strike. The masterminds and instigators of this strike are the Lu Da Company, which is operated by Japanese. It is strange that the Chinese big coal merchants were used by them and echoed their voices. The biggest losers in the strike were the small merchants. On the surface, two to three hundred large and small coal merchants in Zibo Zhangwei and other places are united under the organization of the Mining Merchants' Federation, but in fact, the small coal merchants have no choice. It is now reported that the small coal merchants, for the sake of their capital, have automatically requested the Railway Bureau to approve their applications as soon as possible and start transportation immediately. It is said that the Railway Bureau has approved their applications and promised to give priority to the small coal merchants to start transportation first. The problem will be solved soon, and the big storm of the strike may not be difficult to quell. It is also reported that the Railway Bureau believes that the big coal merchants' insistence on the strike is unreasonable, so it will not make any concessions to the coal merchants' demands and will wait for the situation to change.

<h3>Ye Chucang's Opinions on Famine Preparedness</h3>
<p>The New Method of Silkworm Rearing Has Achieved Results</p>
<p>Actively Planning Special Funds for Famine Preparedness</p>
<p>Construction and Disaster Relief Can Be Combined</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th), at 9:00 a.m., the Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee held a commemorative week in the committee's auditorium. Committee members Yang Xingqin, Zhang Yuanyang, Qi Xiyong, Provincial Government Representative Ye Chucang, and all the committee's staff attended. Chairman Yang Xingqin presided over the ceremony. The chairman introduced Provincial Government Chairman Ye Chucang to report on the recent work of the provincial government. The speech is as follows: Chairman, fellow comrades, in the past eight or nine days, there has been no important issue for the provincial government to report, and there have been no major events in various places. However, in the future, I am afraid that there will be many issues worthy of our attention. The saying "prepare for a rainy day" really makes me feel infinitely worried. Today, I will report on one thing, and at the same time, I want to make a request to the comrades of the Provincial Party Department and the comrades of the entire province. What I want to report today is the harvest this year. Last year can be considered a bumper year, but this year is not. There will be a major famine, which will affect public order, rural economy, and all other undertakings. If we cannot reverse the fate of this major famine, the difficulties that various aspects of the province will feel in the future cannot be described in words. Time flies quickly. In a flash, it is the end of May, and the bright spring has said goodbye to us. Everyone knows that the silkworm work is over. Speaking of sericulture, this year's harvest is really too pitiful. Because of too much rain and too cold weather, the result is only one-tenth of last year's. Therefore, farmers and merchants have suffered great losses, and Jiangsu's productivity has shrunk a lot invisibly. In the midst of everyone frowning at this news, there are still some things that can be comforting.</p>
<p>The new method of silkworm rearing is the success of using new methods for silkworm rearing and mulberry planting. According to Director He of the Agricultural and Mining Department, we have been following the old methods of silkworm rearing and mulberry planting. If we had used the old methods this year, I am afraid that we would have failed completely. Fortunately, we adopted new methods and were still able to obtain one-tenth of last year's results. The new method of silkworm rearing involves placing a brazier and a thermometer in the silkworm room to prevent the indoor air from being too cold, too humid, too warm, or too dry. Therefore, it is trusted by farmers. In this way, the farmers' adoption of new methods for silkworm rearing and mulberry planting will definitely be promoted unimpeded and easily become widespread in the future. After adopting new methods and without such unique weather as this year, the harvest of sericulture will naturally have an increased grasp compared to the past harvest. This year's sericulture business has already failed. Let's take a look at the so-called small wheat harvest. Every time I sit in the car and look out the window all the way, I see that many low-lying fields of wheat have been submerged in water. Even those that are not submerged are short and sparse. Seeing the small harvest is also discounted. I also see reports that the people in Jiangbei are requesting to open the dam. There has never been a request to open the dam in May. It is only opened in August and September when the summer floods rise. The current situation is already like this, so how dangerous will it be when the summer floods rise in August and September?</p>
<p>Rice prices are soaring. The impact of too much rain has already affected the price of white rice. Before January, unpolished rice was eight yuan per dan, but in the market it was only ten yuan per dan. Now, the price of rice has exceeded twelve yuan, and it continues to rise. When rice prices did not rise, some people asked why rice prices did not rise, whether it was because there was too much rice. In fact, Jiangsu has a population of 30 million. Where can so much white rice be produced for so many people to eat? Then, the reason why it does not rise is in what place? It depends on how the autumn harvest is this year. If the autumn harvest is good this year, the price of rice will not rise. If the autumn harvest is not good, the price of rice will rise. It is said that rice merchants have a very correct understanding from their historical experience. Now, everyone sees that the impact of too much rain on this year's autumn harvest is naturally hoped to be a good harvest. So, there are many people who hoard rice and do not sell it, and there are many people who buy up rice. There are even people who secretly smuggle it out.</p>
<p>Prohibiting rice exports. The provincial government originally set a standard rice price, which has now been exceeded, so it should stop issuing passports for rice exports. Originally, the provincial government allowed rice exports because rice prices were cheap and farmers suffered losses, so it allowed rice exports so that rice prices would not be too cheap and farmers could earn a little profit. However, the current rice price has risen above the standard price. Although passports have been suspended, and even rice exports have been prohibited, I am afraid that in a place like Jiangsu, where transportation is developed in all directions, there are not only seaports but also rivers that are difficult to defend against. Shanghai absolutely prohibits smuggling, and no one dares to insure it. Everyone knows that the interests of ordinary merchants often conflict with the hopes of the poor to eat cheap rice. On the government side, it can only do its best. As for saving this natural crop failure, its effectiveness is very difficult to express. This year, we are facing this major difficulty.</p>
<p>Public order is worrying. If there is no preparation beforehand, the public order in the local area will be difficult to guarantee. The destruction of the rural economy and the increase of bandits is also an opportunity for the communists to return. From this, we can see that a poor autumn harvest affects various undertakings, and Jiangsu's finances will have no way out. Since finances have no way out, all government affairs will be suspended. The ancients said that the people take food as their heaven. It can really be said that everything takes food as its heaven. The government feels that although there is nothing wrong in the territory at present, the great disaster in the future is coming, so we must be prepared first. If we only dig a well when we are thirsty, will it be too late? Taking advantage of the three or four months of preparation time, we will quickly catch up and work hard to find a way, and perhaps we can save a little. The provincial government now has a more viable task to solve the danger, which is to store grain. Last year, the Civil Affairs Department seriously did it. According to a detailed investigation, the past storage of grain in various counties can be divided into three levels: 1. There are very few counties that store rice and grain. 2. There are relatively more counties that store grain funds. 3. There are very few counties that store grain funds, and some simply do not have them. Even the granaries for storing grain are not available. After the provincial government saw this, it paid close attention to it. The counties that can do it seriously have now stored grain. As for those who have stored more grain funds, at least they have stored some grain funds and repaired the granaries completely. If this grain storage problem can be done a little more, the degree of danger will be reduced a little. At the same time, I think that the provincial government's financial difficulties have reached the extreme. Of course, this is due to the imperfect methods that have led to the embezzlement of those who are levied. This is an administrative shortcoming, and it is also the environment that makes it so.</p>
<p>Raising funds to prepare for famine. The provincial government still wants to actively plan a sum of money to prepare for famine. Although there is no certainty for the time being, it will be realized sooner or later. Furthermore, the construction funds must be used for construction and cannot be moved. Nor can the construction funds be used for famine preparedness. However, I believe that using this construction fund for the disaster relief effort will not hinder the construction business and will be more beneficial to the famine preparation. Both sides are taken into account and both receive their benefits. This is using work as a form of relief. For example, if this construction business originally planned to hire 300 workers and could be used for three years, now hire 600 workers who have no food to eat to complete it in one year. Then, these 600 people will not be in famine at that time. Extending this to all the construction undertakings in the province, the effect will definitely be quite evident. The provincial government should do its best to take the above three roads for avoiding famine. Now, the provincial government is working hard to do this disaster relief work, and at the same time, it also wants to make the people understand that this great disaster is coming. After the people understand, the tenth is to make them also prepare. Fortunately, various public organizations in Jiangsu have been established, which is relatively easier to handle. Everyone should get up and prepare for a rainy day, so that everyone can easily lift it up.</p>
<p>The disaster relief movement is best led by the Provincial Party Department and lower-level party departments to do a disaster relief movement, because many people are still unaware of the danger of this great famine. There are even many people who want to take advantage of this opportunity to make quick profits and are afraid that the famine will not come. These people need the comrades of the Party Department to awaken them. In any case, we must make them aware and come to work hard on famine preparation to share some of the difficulties that the government cannot solve. I hope that the comrades of the Party Department will do a few things for the people. For example, in the disaster relief event, the people were originally unaware. We awakened them, planned with them, and helped them. Everyone is fully prepared to pass through the dangerous border safely. The so-called preparation is without worry, so the people are aware that their strength is very great, and their belief in the comrades of the Party is of course also very great. The comrades of the Party who gain the people's belief are the ones who gain the people's strength.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Fast Mail</h3>
<p>The territory under the jurisdiction of Hang County borders Yuhang, Fuyang, Deqing, Wukang, Jiaxing, Wuxing, and Haining counties. The land area is quite large. The Land Bureau previously sent teams to measure more than 310,000 mu. The sand dunes along the river are not included. The total land price is about 60 million yuan, and the tax rate is 5 per thousand, which can collect 300,000 yuan. The municipal government plans to re-organize the land tax from the 20th year of the Republic of China and has already been planning for it.</p>
<p>The provincial government ordered the Construction Department to investigate Ping Shui green tea produced in various places in Shao County, Sheng County, Zhuji, Xinchang, Shangyu, Fuyang, and Fenghua and sold to the United States. However, it has recently been found that mountain households in various tea areas often add white powder, coal paste, and lotus root mud, which is harmful to health and affects international trade. Strict ban should be implemented. After receiving the order, Director Shi has transferred the order to the county chiefs of the respective counties to convene tea merchants' associations to discuss the method.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government is actively banning restaurants and grocery stores from adding a small bill. The municipal government has issued a notice to implement the cancellation from June 1st. Now, all the employees of restaurants and grocery stores in the urban area have jointly elected representatives such as Wang Jinzhang to submit a petition to the provincial government requesting understanding of their livelihood. Chairman Zhang has ordered the municipal government to postpone the implementation and discuss a proper method.</p>
<p>The work of the Hangzhou Municipal Clearing Bureau is extremely tense. The section chiefs of the 13th district have dispatched personnel to investigate households from the 26th, and the neighborhood associations have taken the guarantee. The village system has not yet been reorganized, so the old village system of ten households per neighborhood is still used. (27th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Capture of False Battalion Commander Tao Hulong: Tai Bao A Shu's Party, False Battalion Commander Tao Hulong, who was wanted with a reward, has been known for his bravery and has recently been hiding in Shanghai. Last night (the 26th), he was arrested in Shanghai by Fan Guozhong of the First Water Police Team. He was transferred to Songjiang on the 27th and transferred to the Jinshan Team Headquarters for strict interrogation.</p>
<p>New Merchant Comes to Song to Start Slaughter Tax: Recently, Nanjing native Wang Qingqiu applied to the Provincial Education Management Office to undertake the slaughter tax in this county. The recognized tax amount was increased by 10%, totaling 18,150 yuan. After the office approved the appointment, it dispatched representative Wang Qiao to Song yesterday to contact Zhu Cui, an official of the Slaughter Tax Bureau, to transfer the procedures. It is said that they have leased the Yao residence at the entrance of Fujia Lane to set up a bureau to start collecting taxes. However, the meat industry is declining day by day, and the recognized tax has suddenly increased by 10%. If the education surtax is included, it will inevitably be taken from the meat merchants, which will inevitably increase the burden.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Police and Bandits Open Fire to Rescue Many Hostages: The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Marine Police defeated a large gang of lake bandits in Taihu Tianda Dang. After intercepting a bandit ship in Hengjing, many hostage cases have continued to emerge. The following is a brief record: When the firing started, Shen, the district chief of the third district of the Suzhou Water Police, commanded the patrol boats of each team to attack the places where the lake bandits gathered from the areas of Damao Port, Wu Lou, Hengjing, Lujia Bang, and Nanku in Wujiang County. The hostages Ma Jishan and Zhang Baoquan were hidden in a bandit ship in the west of Nanku. When the bandits heard the gunfire, they took their weapons ashore and fled. Ma and others also took the opportunity to escape and went to the north of Nanku. They heard children crying in the depths of the reeds and followed the tracks to find two hostage ships. They rescued women and children including Li Ni's, Wu Bensen, Yu A'kui, etc., five people. They were transferred to a boat and were rocked by Ma and Zhang to Guajin Bridge where they were met by the Anjing warship stationed there. Captain Guo Jizhi checked, interrogated, and confirmed the truth before handing them over to Xie Wenbin, the patrol officer of the 7th boat of the 2nd branch of the 11th team of the marine police and Kong Xiankui, the patrol officer of the 3rd boat of the 2nd branch of the 13th team, who were stationed there. They were sent to Suzhou yesterday (27th) to be processed by the district department. It is also learned that District Chief Shen and Police Captain Du entered the lake yesterday to search for the remnants of the bandits. Du Ding will return to the city today (28th).</p>
<p>Hu Yinglong's Wife Murder Case Scheduled for Trial: The case of Hu Yinglong, an employee of the Songjiang Dianye Bank, being suspected of conspiring with his stepmother Hu Nie to murder his wife Hu Zhang, has been declared innocent by the Songjiang County Court. The prosecutor appealed to the High Court, which investigated the case through the Third Criminal Court a few days ago. The trial is now scheduled to be held on June 15.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Silk Cocoon Industry Not Allowed to be Exempted from Business Tax: The Wuxi Cocoon Industry Association previously submitted a letter stating the reasons for the silk cocoon industry's business tax collection to the County Chamber of Commerce for transfer to the Business Tax Bureau, and telegraphed the provincial departments to appeal for exemption from business tax. The Business Tax Bureau has received a telegram from the Finance Department yesterday stating that the business tax of the silk cocoon industry in this province has been telegraphed to various counties for immediate collection. The various cocoon firms wish to be exempted from business tax because they have received dental licenses. It must be known that the issuance of dental licenses is for the purpose of establishing cocoon firms. The collection and transportation of cocoons by cocoon merchants who have raised funds are two different things and must not be exempted on the pretext of dental licenses. The director of the bureau should comply with the instructions, send personnel to collect taxes according to regulations, and forward the letter to the Chamber of Commerce to assist in the process. Director Yang of the bureau has telegraphed the County Chamber of Commerce and the Silk Cocoon Industry Association to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<p>Order to Demolish Illegal Buildings: Zhu Zhongyuan, a resident of Zhongzheng Road, built a house that encroached on the highway. The nearby citizens reported the matter, and the lawsuit has been going on for a year without a solution. Recently, the County Construction Bureau received instructions from the County Government to demolish Zhu's encroaching house within a time limit, but it has not been implemented. Yesterday, the Construction Bureau again sent a letter to the Second Public Security Bureau requesting that the police be dispatched to the scene to take care of the matter and hire workers to forcibly demolish the house in order to comply with the law.</p>
<p>The opening of the Yuan township bandits robbed and injured people: In the fourth district (Kaiyuan township) of the county, the families of Liu Zhenjia and Liu Chengzhi in Yangxi Riverkou Xiaoliu Lane, Dongji Township, were suddenly robbed by eight or nine bandits speaking with a northern accent, wearing short clothes and holding weapons at about 2:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. One of the bandits dug a hole in the back door and opened the door to let the other bandits in. They ransacked the boxes and cabinets and looted arbitrarily for half an hour before escaping with their loot. After the event, they checked the losses of more than one hundred yuan. When the bandits were robbing, they also injured Wu Hesheng, the long-term worker of Liu Zhenjia, with a tap water iron pipe. The injury was quite serious and was reported by the owner to the First Police Station of the Ninth Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, it was transferred to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Also, the family of Zhou Zhaofu's uncle in the third district (Yangming Township) was also robbed the night before last, with the loss of more than one hundred yuan. Also, a kidnapping case occurred in Yao Zhuangbang in the 11th district, with four villagers being kidnapped.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Dismissal of the Director of the Finance Bureau. Liu Hongzhao, the Director of the Finance Bureau of Wuyi, had been in office for several years. Last night (the 26th), news was received from the provincial authorities that Director Liu had been dismissed due to a case. The vacancy will be filled by Qian Zhaoda, who has already been approved by the Provincial Government's meeting. Director Qian, whose courtesy name is Zun San, is from Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province. He was originally the head of the accounting section of the Department of Finance and had come to Changzhou once a decade ago, keeping his movements very secret.</p>
<p>Missing Student from Changzhou Middle School. Zhu Xingnian, an 18-year-old student from Jingjiang at Wuyi Provincial Changzhou Middle School, went out alone a week ago without asking for leave from the school. He has not yet returned. The school has sent people to search in all directions, but without success. The school had no choice but to notify the student's family yesterday to assist in the search. As for the reason for his departure, it is said that the student had received threatening letters twice. After he left, all the books and wardrobes were left unlocked, which shows that he was not prepared beforehand.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Robbery and Assault Occurs in the Eastern Countryside. Yuan Binghai's house, a farmer in Sizhuang Village, Zheliuqiao, Eastern Countryside, was suddenly attacked by many bandits on the night of the 21st of this month. Each of them carrying guns and sharp blades, they broke into the house and ransacked it. Yuan's mother, Wang, and farmhands were unable to escape and were held down by the bandits who demanded money. First, they used fire to burn them, and then stabbed them with knives. Wang was seriously injured and died on the spot. The farmhand, Cai Songsou, was also seriously injured and may die. In addition, Hang Haozhen's house in Lao Hang Village, Henan, Lingkou, was suddenly attacked by forty or more bandits last night who ransacked the house.

Xun Mingyou, a patrol leader stationed in Dantu, received a report from villagers that salt smugglers were gathering in groups and with great force in Yike Island. Fearing an accident, he immediately reported to the Central Unit. Zhang Zhanqi, the commander of the Central Unit, upon hearing this, immediately led several patrol leaders and police officers to the location. They found salt smugglers selling in the area and immediately went forward to arrest them. The two sides fought fiercely for a long time before the bandits fled. They seized two salt boats, dozens of piculs of smuggled salt, and nine bandits, including Chen Deqi, He Xiangtai, and women. The boat and salt were taken to the headquarters for investigation.</p>

Director Niu of the April fees promised to borrow 100,000 yuan, and Chairman Ye promised to allocate 100,000 yuan.

<p>A Joint Presentation from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education</p>
<h3>Safeguarding the Funding of County Education</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan previously ordered the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education to deliberate on the Shandong Provincial Consolidation Committee's request to revoke the resolution of the Internal Affairs Conference to abolish the County Education Funding Management Committee. Yesterday, a joint presentation from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education was received by the Executive Yuan, stating that the educational funding of the former educational funding management agencies could not avoid misappropriation. If all the expenses were managed by the Financial Bureau, the various expenditures of the place would be transferred and moved, which could not ensure that there would be no deficit. The Ministry decided to add three supplementary measures, one of which is that the county's local educational funds should be collected by the Financial Bureau, but must be paid to the local educational administrative organs in accordance with the amount of educational special funds that should be obtained, and must not be misappropriated or delayed. The second is that when necessary, the educational administrative organs may send personnel to assist the Financial Bureau in collecting special educational funds. The third is to organize a county-wide financial supervision committee according to the provisions of the original case, and the educational administrative organs shall elect several relevant personnel to join the committee to supervise the revenue of special educational funds. These supplementary measures are intended to respect the party guidelines and take into account the meaning of unified finance.</p>

<h3>Labor University Elementary School Teachers Strike</h3>
<p>Jiangwan Labor University Elementary School Sends Telegram via Express Mail: To all news agencies nationwide, to the founders of Labor University in Nanjing, Mr. Cai Zimin, Mr. Li Shizeng, Mr. Wu Zhihui, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, Mr. Yi Yincun in Peiping, Mr. Chu Minyi, Mr. Yan Shenyu in Shanghai, Mr. Kuang Husheng, and Mr. Zhang Xingbai: The elementary school department of this university has been established for four years and has achieved considerable success. However, since President Wang appointed Zheng Yangu as the head of the school in February, his measures have been absurd, the school's affairs have been neglected, and he has violated party principles and does not understand education. All teachers and staff deeply disapprove. We have previously listed the facts and jointly requested the president to approve the replacement, so that the labor elementary school can continue to develop in an orderly manner. However, the matter has been delayed for a month without any progress, which has aroused the righteous indignation of all. We have had no choice but to unanimously strike on May 26th in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon of the same day, we received a letter from the Document Section in the name of "President's Instructions" dismissing eight teachers and staff. Upon hearing the news, everyone believed that this was an unprecedented event in the education community. Righteous indignation filled our hearts and could not be suppressed. We unanimously agreed to stay or leave together and continue the strike to the end. We respectfully admire that all of you gentlemen have put in great effort and cared for Labor University more than anyone else. We earnestly hope that you will uphold justice and promote the enlightenment of the school authorities, so that the foundation of labor education will not be destroyed by Zheng Yangu alone. The entire faculty and staff of Labor University are deeply grateful: Guo Renquan, Zhu Fan, Liu Chang'e, Zheng Zhigang, Liu Tianxing, Chen Chongruo, Zhou Yongbai, Chen Zeqin, Mao Xuefu, Liang Wenwei, Hu Weiyu, Li Hua, Gao Shaolian, Wang Liufen, Wang Qigao, Qian Chuxiang, He Jingye, Huang Jingpei, Wang Suzhen, Lu Shaosheng, Liu Jing, Zhang Baoshan, Zhou Jialian, Zhang Liangrou, Li Xiyin, and Zhu Danming, May 27th.</p>

<h3>One Word of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>A person who is good at drinking but doesn't get drunk and a person who is fond of women but doesn't indulge in prostitution are masters in their respective domains.</p>
<p>Modern women only know how to manipulate men as a clever strategy, but they don't realize that they have already become men's playthings.</p>
<p>Debts must be repaid, but emotional debts are not. Therefore, there are so many unfaithful people in the world.</p>
<p>The lover you acquire with beauty and money will inevitably have a rival who is more beautiful and wealthier who will snatch your lover away one day.</p>
<p>Only with the ability to be independent can you carry out the work of love, so ordinary young students often become sacrifices in love.</p>
<p>In the past, the bride's shy and demure state was something to savor, so three days and three nights of wedding banquets still seemed too short. Now, the bride is composed and generous, answering every question, and no one can do anything about it. Therefore, guests at the wedding banquet have to leave when the fun is over and dare not disturb her any longer.</p>
<p>Talking about love with a modern woman is like seeking a tiger's skin, because a modern woman's desires can never be satisfied by one person's efforts.</p>
<p>A violent robber who wields weapons in broad daylight is not to be feared, but a foreign merchant who absorbs money is terrifying.</p>
<p>In the past, a maiden in her boudoir remained faithful after finding a satisfactory spouse. Now, a modern woman takes her intended partner lightly and doesn't take it seriously.</p>
<h3>Anecdotal Record of the Four Universities' English Debate</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xu Qicheng</p>
<p>The Four Universities English Debate is usually held once a year. The participants include Guanghua, Fudan, Jiaotong, and Jinan Universities. This year's debate was divided into two groups for preliminary rounds. The topic was "Should China borrow silver loans from the United States for domestic construction?" As a result, Jiaotong and Fudan Universities won the right to compete in the finals. The two schools held the final competition on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month at Jiaotong University's Wenzhi Hall. The judges included Chen Tingrui, Yan Fuqing, Guo Boliang, and Yan Enyou, all eminent scholars of the time. The competition started at 3 PM and ended at 5 PM. The events were amusing and should be recorded.</p>
<p>Three Misses. Traditionally, very few female students participate in the Four Universities Debate, even if there are only one or two. However, in this year's English debate, the competitors from the two schools were only six people, but the Misses accounted for half of them. The surge in women's rights shows that the present is not what it used to be.</p>
<p>Several Charts. In order to win the final victory, the Fudan representatives specially drew three charts: one was a Chinese bond chart, one was a Chinese silver reserve chart, and one was a Shanghai real estate value chart. All were drawn on bamboo cloth in color, exquisitely crafted. It can be seen that the school is meticulous and diligent in its research.</p>
<p>Earth-Shattering. Ms. Zhu Yaozhen of Jiaotong University is an outstanding speaker of the school. She has consistently ranked first in inter-school competitions in the past two years. This time, she used her talent to express a positive argument on the urgency of silver loans, speaking eloquently and movingly. Her English was fluent and her posture was sophisticated, truly remarkable.</p>
<p>Like Talking at Home. Ms. Liang Peishu of Fudan represented her school at the Jiangnan University forum and was still showing her face for the first time, but her good attitude and beautiful tone were rare. She presented two questions to question the opponent with a calm and generous expression that could not be imitated by a pretentious person, and she spoke eloquently without pausing, as if coughing up pearls and spitting out jade. It made the listeners forget their weariness. It was said that Ms. Liang's speech, her posture, and her expression were like chatting with family around the stove.</p>
<p>Smiling. Ms. Wang Baomin of Fudan was also a representative. Ms. Wang was still young, with two braids parted on her shoulders, extremely delicate and petite. What was even more valuable was that Ms. Wang spoke with a smile on her face, innocent and lively.</p>
<p>Using the Past to Explain the Present. The famous lawyer Mr. Chen Tingrui was one of the judges on that day. After everyone had finished speaking, President Li Zhaohuan invited him to give a speech. He then gave a grand speech, saying that China lacked debating talent. Su Qin and Zhang Yi in the Warring States Period were able to persuade the six countries to serve Qin with their three-inch tongues, but that was only a conversation with individual rulers, not a public speech. Mencius also claimed to be a debater, saying, "Do I like to debate? I have no choice." However, Mencius's debate was only with the various princes and ministers, and it was not a speech either. Zhuge Liang in the Three Kingdoms was also good at eloquence, but the scope was still very narrow. Therefore, although there were many talented people in China, there were not many in this field. The reason was nothing more than that the spoken and written language was inconsistent, the language was not unified, there was no communal life, and there was no democratic politics. Today's orators are all able to surpass Qin Mencius and Zhuge, and are truly the pioneers of debate talent in China. For a time, the listeners were all amazed.</p>
<p>Girls' Monopoly. Before long, the president announced the end of the competition, calculating that the first place was Liang Peishu of Fudan, the second place was Wang Baomin, and the third place was Zhu Yaozhen of Jiaotong. The most amazing thing was that the top three places were all monopolized by girls. Therefore, the silver cup, silver shield, and other prizes were all taken away by the three ladies in jubilation. Everyone applauded to congratulate them. This kind of result was unprecedented since the Four Universities competition.</p>
<p>Shaking Hands and Talking Happily. After leaving the venue, Ms. Zhu Yaozhen of Jiaotong University immediately stepped forward to shake hands with Liang Wang, expressing mutual admiration. The harmony and sincerity were conveyed in their words. The onlookers were like a wall, all sighing at the brightness of their attitude, which was unattainable.</p>
<h3>Grand Celebration of the Sixth Anniversary of the Zhi Rou Boxing Club</h3>
<p>— Shen</p>
<p>On May 24th, about 400 people attended the sixth anniversary of the Zhi Rou Boxing Club, and several Japanese martial arts experts joined to observe. The meeting started at 2 PM. The entire group bowed three times to Zhang Sanfeng, the founder of Tai Chi. Then, Ms. Sun Shutong was invited to give certificates. The names of the eight graduates have already been seen in this newspaper. The president of the club, Chen Weiming, reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that the club holds a public celebration of the founder's birthday every year. Some people say that this is a scientific era and should not have such superstitious actions. The speaker also admitted that he believed in superstition, but that this superstition was not forgetting the source, which was morally better than those who did not believe in superstition and forgot the source. Then, Director Zhang Zhijiang of the Central Martial Arts Hall, representing Weng Guoxun, gave a speech, saying that martial arts are a matter of strengthening the race and the country and should not be divided into schools. His words were very pertinent. Then, Sun Lutang gave a speech, saying that he had studied Tai Chi with Mr. Yang Jianhou since he was in his twenties, and now after decades, he knew its meaning was even more profound. How could this kind of boxing be fabricated by ordinary people? It has been passed down from ancient times, which is the teachings of the Sanfeng founder. How could it be a lie to future generations? Four years ago, there were few people practicing Tai Chi, but since Xu Yusheng established the Sports Association in Beijing, there have been more scholars in the north. Since Chen Weiming came south, it has become very popular in the south. He hopes that you will work hard to practice. The competition used a lottery method. The body and footwork were extremely light and agile, showing the excellence of the results. Sun Lutang's Tai Chi Bagua Sword had a overflowing spirit and was getting healthier as he got older. Sun Cunzhou's Bagua Palm Bagua Sword brought a comical meaning everywhere in the lively atmosphere, making people laugh. Ms. Sun Shutong's Bagua Sword was leisurely, calm, and stable, showing her deep skills. Ye Zongtai's Bagua Sword was also very pure. Wu Zizhen's Tai Chi had extremely pure kung fu and was the son of Wu Jianquan. Wu Huichuan and his apprentices' Tai Chi Sword Pushing Hands all showed solid kung fu. Ye Dami's Tai Chi had a unique new meaning. Xu Wenfu's Bagua Double Swords, Single Knife, Stick, and Hong Boxing were extremely energetic. Chen Weiming and Hu Puan and Chen Duomin's Pushing Hands scattered attacks. Jian Bangqin and her younger brother Bangwu's Wudang swordplay was met with thunderous applause. After the performance, there was a dinner and Kunqu opera performance, which was the most popular at the time.</p>
<p>Short News. Sun Zixue recently improved the group fan and worked with famous artists in Shanghai to collect in the Xue Lu to work on painting fans. Although there have been rain and wind in the evenings, the painters are still concentrated and devoted themselves to choosing the finest pieces for lithography. The art exhibition will be opened at the Ningbo Township Association on the 28th, 29th and 30th, with the public as the same good fans. The best works in the fan art flowers are Shang Shengbai Xie Gongzhan Wang Shizi Ma Mengrong Ma Wanli Ye Weishen Ma Daiyun Hong Lisheng. The best of the mountains and rivers are He Tianjian Ma Qizhou Xu Zhengbai Zheng Wuchang Hu Ruosi Shen Shoutian Sun Xueni is the most refined. He is like Xiong Songquan's beasts, Ma Tai's horses, Tian Qingquan's Xie Zhiguang's ladies, all of which are exquisite and unique in the recent art world. It is also heard that the opening day will be given to the guests a group fan of the special edition of a colorful gorgeous that broke the sky. (Swallow)</p>
<p>Publishing News. The Wenhu Half-Monthly, edited by Cao Shuhang and Wu Lianzhou, has published the seventh issue of the second volume, which is more refined than before. Those who want to read it can attach a six-cent stamp and send a letter to the Wenhu Special Issue Office, No. 372 Sanma Road.</p>
<p>Correction. In yesterday's Huanghai Travels, in the second sentence of the sixteenth line, "They are this human race", "human race" is a mistake, it should be "varieties of", so we make this correction.</p>
<h3>Huanghai Travels (15)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>If you want to know the development of Japan's chemical industry, you can visit the Chemical Industry Exhibition in Ueno Park. This trip coincided with the grand event. All kinds of things to eat, wear, and use are mostly unseen elsewhere, and none of them are imported. This day was April 10th. Unfortunately, the meeting was about to close.</p>
<p>One day I wanted a haircut, so I found an overseas Chinese barbershop. The staff were all from Zhenjiang. I asked how business was. They replied that it was not good and that they were going back. I asked why. They replied that the Japanese restrictions were very strict. After barbers received their licenses, licenses were no longer issued to Chinese people. If you want to open a barbershop, you have to take an exam. I asked what kind of exam. The junior boss pulled out a test paper with nine questions. The first two questions were related to physiology, such as asking about the structure of muscles and the structure of glands. The third, fourth, and fifth questions were related to hygiene, such as asking about the number of infectious diseases, how to prevent certain diseases, and how to treat them. The remaining four questions were related to regulations, such as the relationship between stores and police laws, the organization of companies, and the outline of bankruptcy law. Oh, without special preparation, even the average high school graduate would inevitably fail.</p>
<p>After the haircut, help me wash my face. Above the hot and cold water taps, there is a specially installed water temperature regulator with a rotating needle on the face. To set the water at a certain temperature, turn it to that temperature. Looking at the brand, it was produced by a factory in Osaka.</p>
<p>The development of Osaka's industry began with vehicle manufacturing. There were 30 factories with an annual production value of 11.5 million yuan and an export value of 1.06 million yuan, exported to Manchuria and other parts of China. There were 112 bicycle and accessory manufacturing factories with an annual production value of 7.2 million yuan and an export value of 2.4 million yuan, exported to Nanyang, Hong Kong, and China. There were 30 enamel manufacturing factories with an annual production value of 8.3 million yuan and an export value of 6.1 million yuan, exported to India, Nanyang, Manchuria, and other parts of China. Other cases are similar. See the 7th Osaka Prefecture Craft Exhibition.</p>
<p>Entering a candy store, I saw the certificates hanging on the wall: Meiji 42nd year, Sanhe Xingye Club 1st Anniversary Commemorative Product Evaluation Certificate, Meiji 43rd year, National Candy Conference Certificate, Meiji 43rd year, 7th National Production Exposition Certificate, Meiji 43rd year, Imperial Production Promotion Society Certificate, Meiji 44th year, National Craft Products Promotion Society Certificate, Taisho 2nd year, 2nd National Candy</p>
<p>Exhibition Certificate, Taisho 5th year, National Ideal Food and Drink Evaluation Certificate, Taisho 11th year, Heiwa Memorial Tokyo Exposition Certificate</p>
<p>I tried to think about it silently, and I couldn't help but slap the table and shout, "No wonder their manufacturing industry is so developed!" The National Production Exposition has been held more than a dozen times. A special national evaluation meeting was held for ideal food and drinks. A small candy store held a national exhibition one after another. Looking back at our China, the bustling Nanyang Industrial Fair was only held once, and the bustling national goods exhibition was only held once.</p>

<h3>The Future World (1)</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng (Pseudonym)</p>
<p>It is said that one evening, by the lamp and beside the wine, I was meditating on the future world. This future world, however, exists only in relation to the past and present. In an instant, I thought of a friend in the future world. His pen name is Tian Bu Xu Sheng (Heaven Does Not Make Empty Birth). He is a physicist at the university. He said, "Your future world is my present world. In a moment of the past, I have already revolutionized the four major necessities of life: clothing, food, housing, and transportation." Therefore, my clothes are different from the others. When worn, they are warm in winter and cool in summer. There is no need to change them throughout the year, and there is no need to wash them. If they get dusty, just brush them with a feather duster. If you really need to wash them, just let them get rained on and you can wipe them dry immediately. When you go to sleep at night, you don't need to take them off, and you don't need quilts or mosquito nets. You don't have to worry about mosquitoes, fleas, or lice biting you, and even flies can't stand on them." What material do you think it is made of? It's actually very ordinary; it's "glass yarn" "seamless heavenly garment." Everyone should be familiar with it, but my glass yarn is not just famous in name only. I initially used sodium glass to make silk because it was too hard and easily broken. Therefore, I switched to using potassium glass to make it into extremely fine artificial silk. Initially, steel pipes were used to make capillaries, but later I learned that although the melting point of glass is very high, when using an extremely small volume, it is quickly squeezed out of the capillary with little latent heat. The heat transfer of metal is not as good, just like bullets being fired from cannons. Therefore, I replaced the steel pipe with gunmetal, and the result was very good. However, copper prices are very expensive. I thought that the crucibles for melting glass were originally made of magnesium oxide, so I calcined the magnesium carbonate used to make tooth powder into magnesium oxide to make capillaries. As expected, I was very satisfied and made the glass silk very smooth and fine. The potassium carbonate I used was originally imported from foreign countries, but because it was too expensive, I switched to using cottonseed hulls from oil mills to replace coal to burn the glass. I used the cottonseed hull ash that was burned to make soup. After burning the ash liquid dry, it became potassium carbonate, which was very cheap. At first, I was worried that the volume of cottonseed hulls was too large and could not be stacked, but after experiments, each cubic foot could hold 20 pounds. A ten-foot square room could hold ten tons. Its calorific value can raise 205 pounds of water from room temperature to 100 degrees Celsius, producing steam. When 40 pounds are used, it can be completely vaporized, which is more economical than coal dust, because one pound of coal dust can only vaporize three and a half pounds of water. Number 2 coal dust costs 13 yuan per ton, while cottonseed hulls cost 8 jiao per dan, which is 4 jiao and 4 fen more expensive per ton, but each ton of hulls can produce 112 pounds of ash. The ash liquid extracted can extract more than 30 pounds of potassium carbonate, which is worth more than 4 liang of silver! Potassium glass is soft glass with a kind of asbestos fiber added to it, so after it is made into artificial silk, a circular knitting machine is used to make clothes, which fit very well. In winter, it can protect body temperature from radiating outward. Even if the wind is strong, it feels like there is a glass window separating you, and you don't feel cold. However, it is a bit uncomfortable when the summer sunlight shines on it, and it is not very elegant because it is transparent. Therefore, I have improved it several times.</p>

<h3>The Gold Market Is Chaotic and Turning Soft</h3>
<p>Turbulence appears from time to time. Yesterday, the 27th, the trend of gold fixing slightly declined, and the state was chaotic and difficult to predict. The waves were surging, people's hearts were in a daze, and prosperity and decline were irregular. The total market had more than ten taels of retrospect, and in the end, it fell slightly by three taels and a few points. The silver market suddenly reported an increase, so the opening was low, and then it broke through 800 taels. Afterwards, major players made fierce purchases, and foreign exchange was also bullish. However, the listed price remained the same, and a sudden and rapid rise occurred. Ten taels reappeared at a new high of 809 taels and a few points. By the afternoon session, the selling pressure was strong, and Hengxing, Dadecheng, Yuanxing, Yongdeng and others actively competed to sell, so they fell sharply and directly by eight or nine taels. The after-market seemed to turn mild and slightly increased, but afterwards, it was in a flat and soft state, and the selling side seemed strong, only between 802 and 3 taels. Foreign exchange was closed as usual on Wednesdays.</p>
<p>Rapid advance and retreat. From the opening of the July contract in the morning, it immediately fell by five taels to 802 taels, which was actually because the major players were bearish the day before, but instead it rose by sixteen and three-eighths. The silver price increased by one-eighth, and the private telegrams did not change, so people's hearts were empty. Also, Senchang, Yongfu, Xingyong, Hengxing, Yuan and others sold, and then fell from 03 taels to 798 taels and 5 qian, immediately exiting the market because Zhifeng, Yongwan, Xingda, Xingyongshunli and others came to buy, jumping up by more than six taels. The exchange rate was also good, and the bank absorbed shillings at 1875, with a selling price of 125 to 1875 to shillings. When the announcement was made, it was 05 taels and 2 qian, and the listed price did not change. The internal price was still firm and increased to 07 taels. At this time, wheat firms bought forward shillings at 1875. Before long, Huabank sold 1875, and Hengxing, Shengda, Chunyuan, Yongyuan, Cheng Yong and others sold off, falling by more than five taels in just half an hour, reaching 01 taels and 8 qian at ten o'clock. Then, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanmao, Yongyuan Cheng and speculator Wu and others bought fiercely, especially Anda, who ate up July and August English gold at 125 to 1875, so it jumped by seven taels. At ten thirty, it was 08 taels and a half, suppressing a small two taels for a moment, which was sold by zero households. Suddenly, Fuyu, Chengfeng, Yongdeng and others dragged in, but the stable trend of English gold was still settled at 125. At eleven o'clock, it suddenly rose to 809 taels and 3, breaking the record of the day before. Afterwards, Hengxing, Shengda, Dadecheng, Daxing, Yongyuan, Xingyong and others had strong selling pressure. Huayi issued recent English gold at 125. Sumitomo issued July Dalian at 1 tael and 7 qian and 3. In an instant, it fell into a state of depression, plummeting nine taels. At one fifty, it ended at 800 taels and 05 qian. Then it pulled up one tael and a few points to 01 taels and 8 qian, but the selling side was still strong. The afternoon closed at 801 taels and continued to trade at 800 taels. The listed price was still calculated at 839 taels and 4 qian, a deduction of 34 taels to more than 32 taels. The afternoon closed at more than 38 taels.</p>
<p>The ending is flat and soft. The after-market opened at 01 taels and 2 qian, then at 03 taels and a half, but the Indian exchange rate reported a small two annas and was bought by Fuchang and others. Afterwards, Zhifengyong and others sold, and because the Indian exchange rate did not change recently, the forward rate increased by one anna, so it fell to 01 taels and 7 qian, but there was a turnover of more than one tael. Afterwards, the Dalian gang bought in and rose leisurely by three points and zero to 04 taels and 3 qian, and then depreciated by two taels. Qianchang, Xiangyu and others sold. At three thirty, Tianfeng Yong and items chased in, gradually rising three taels. When it was nearly four o'clock, it was 05 taels and 12 qian. Hengxing Yongfeng sold. At four fifteen, it was 03 taels and 4 qian, and suddenly it increased to 05 taels. However, Yuanheng Fuchang's selling intention did not slacken, so the market closed at four thirty at 03 taels and 9 qian, a decrease of three taels and one qian compared with the previous day, and then rose to 023 taels, but Yuanheng Tongtaichang and others sold again, so the items were deducted by one tael and four qian. According to the full-day maximum price of 809 taels and 3 qian and the minimum price of 798 taels and a half, there was a difference of ten taels and 08 qian. The morning market of items was 02 taels. The afternoon closed at 800 taels. The afternoon 01 taels and 2 qian closed at 02 taels and a half. The listed price was deducted by 38 taels to more than 34 taels. The closing was more than 36 taels, and the registered account was 799 taels to 801 taels, with a water supplement of 797 taels. The afternoon was 800 taels.</p>
<p>Supply exceeds demand. Trader Wu and Chengfeng Yongwan Xing Shunli Yuanmao Yong bought a lot. Hengxing Shengda Decheng Yuanxing Yong sold quite a bit. Others such as Zhifeng Yong Daxing Yong Yuancheng went in and out. Fuyu Cuichang Yong Tongtaichang all went in. Xinhong Yuda Fuxing Yong Yuankang Xiangyuan Tai Futa Heng Chunyuan Yong Yongfeng Qianchang Xiang were all selling positions. In the afternoon, Cuichang Yong Tianfeng Yong Yongheng Yuancheng Xinhong Yuankang Xiangyuan Tai all went in. Wanxing Shunli also went in. Zhifeng Yong Qianchang Yuanheng Hengxing went out. Yuanmao Yong Dadecheng Futai Heng Yu Yu Yu often went in and out. The Guangdong gang sold short a total of about five or six thousand. The Dalian gang entered a total of five thousand six or seven hundred, while exiting one thousand.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange is Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the British and American silver markets rose, but the Shanghai market was still flat. HSBC's listed price did not move, and the bank's transaction price was first loose and then firm, and tended to be flat at noon. The result was similar to the previous night. However, according to the gold market, it seemed to be firm, so the gold fixing fluctuated greatly. It was lower at noon when the market closed. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, each exchange was closed as usual. However, the transaction volume of Chinese merchants in the gold industry was still not slack. It is estimated that more than 200,000 pounds of English gold were transacted, mostly for hedging. The bank's selling was still not deserted, but wheat firms and Anda occasionally absorbed. Bombay telegraphed to sell. There were very few US dollars, and about hundreds of thousands of Japanese dollars went in and out, all belonging to Japanese banks. The British exchange market was stable. It is expected that the day and silver prices will fall in the morning.</p>
<p>English Exchange: The intraday market fluctuated by 125. In the morning, Five Wheat Firms first absorbed August 1875. Huabi issued July and August 125 to 1875, and also issued September 1875. At 9:30, Wheat Firms absorbed September 1875 again (Bombay issued). Dongya issued August 1875, Anda entered July and August 125 to 1875, Mitsui issued July 125, Dongya HSBC did against Korea August 125. Afterwards, Shanghai Mitsui Anda Dongya issued August and September 125. Huayi issued June 125. The noon closing price was 125 to 1875, and the buying price was 25.</p>
<p>American Exchange: The intraday market fluctuated by 25. The morning issuing price was 28 yuan and 8125, and the buying price was 28 yuan and 9375. The noon closing price was 28 yuan and 1875, and the buying price was 88 yuan and 8215.</p>
<p>Eastern Exchange: The intraday market fluctuated by half a cent from morning to noon. The morning issuing price was 1 tael, 7 qian and 1 fen and 5, and the buying price was 1 tael, 7 qian and 1 fen. Taiwan issued July Dalian at 1 tael, 7 qian and 1 fen and 5 in the morning.

Sumitomo issued July at 1 tael and 7 qian and 3. The noon closing price was 1 tael, 7 qian and 2 fen and 5, and the buying price was 1 tael, 7 qian and 2.</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Prices Have Increased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to a telegram from London, the Sino-Indian market first advanced and then retreated, closing flat. The after-market was stable. The United States tended to sell. According to the listed price plus 0625, the recent bill had suddenly increased by 1875, totaling 12 and a half pence. The forward rate increased by 125, totaling 12 pence and 4375. Also, a telegram from New York stated that American silver also increased by 125, totaling 2 jiao and 6 fen and 75. The market was soft. Also, the British to American exchange rate did not change, and the American to British exchange rate slightly decreased. The London shilling fell by 125, totaling 1 shilling, 2 pence and 375. There was no increase or decrease in British to Japanese and Japanese to American exchange rates. The Bombay market was still calculated at 42 rupees and 11 annas.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollars Are Trending Steady</h3>
<p>Recently, the silver dollar market has been slightly more busy during the comparison period, but it is not strong at other times, and transactions are particularly sluggish. At present, during the silkworm cocoon season, according to the situation of previous years, there is a scene of great enthusiasm. However, this year's harvest is poor, and those who collect are not very enthusiastic, resulting in no one asking about silkworm cocoon loans, and few silkworm cocoon dollars are installed and issued. As a result, the good silkworm cocoon season has invisibly materialized.</p>
<p>The interest rate is slightly lower, and silver dismantling remains the same. (Dollar interest) The morning interest rate was still 7 qian, 2 fen, 9 li and 3 hao and 7. It suddenly increased and was no different from the previous day's noon market, and the noon market was slightly more courageous due to weak morale, resulting in a change of a small half a li to 7 qian, 2 fen, 8 li, 8 hao and 7 halves. (Silver dismantling) Both the morning and noon markets opened at 5 fen, which was the same as the previous day. The head allocation and water addition were slightly smaller by one or two points, totaling three or four points. The tightness of silver funds was moderate, but the lack of demand ultimately did not increase.</p>
<p>Corner dollars are uniform, and copper coins are slightly longer. The Jiangnan corner dollar price in the morning and noon markets was not only motionless, but also the transactions were completely untouched, so the price remained the same at 6 qian, 5 fen and 6 li, which was exactly the same as the previous day. Guangdong corner dollars continued to decline. The morning and noon markets were both 6 qian, 4 fen, 6 li, 7 hao and a half, which was a small half a li smaller than the previous day's noon market. The morning transaction was 170,000 corner dollars, and the noon transaction was 40,000 corner dollars. Copper coins were slightly longer, with 500 being 377,500 wen.</p>
<p>The receipt and delivery of silver dollars are moderately busy. (Silver loans) Yesterday, the news of the bank's receipt and delivery in the market was equally busy, so it was very energetic again. Chinese merchants received and delivered 2.56 million, and foreign merchants received and delivered 1.78 million. The receipt and delivery of various goods, exchange rates, taxes and other items was 10.78 million. Special loans were more than 1 million.

<h3>Stocks and Public Bonds Fluctuated Violently and Plummeted</h3>
<p>More Than Half of the Bonds Were Suspended From Bidding and the Downward Trend Was Shocking</p>
<p>The Transaction Volume Reached 29.9 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the securities exchange only had the June futures contract for the May futures, because it was necessary to prepare for delivery and the market was suspended. Because the bond prices had major changes again, the transactions of each bond became more and more prosperous. It is estimated that the transaction volume in the first session in the morning reached more than 10 million, and the second session was also close to 10 million. The afternoon market only opened at 5 o'clock, so there was only one session and the transaction volume was estimated to be 9 million. The trend of each bond was that the situation became more and more dim, and the morale of the market was extremely weak. All parties sold off one after another, and the price of each bond fell rapidly and sharply, falling more than 3 yuan compared with the previous day. By the time of the last session, although a certain party suddenly purchased a lot, the downward trend was still very strong due to the continued extreme weakness of morale. For example, the salaries and dismissal of soldiers, the 19th customs duty and the 20th roll were all suspended from bidding after falling as much as 4 yuan compared with the previous day's closing price (about 3 yuan and 8 jiao lower than the closing price of the previous day). The 20th customs duty and other bonds also continued to drop drastically, and the intensity of the fluctuations was truly shocking. According to those who are familiar with the bond market, the decline in bond prices this time is purely due to the uneasy situation and the emptiness of people's hearts. The Guangdong gang also sold short, which caused this. In this chaotic situation, it is even easier to shake people's hearts. In addition, the exchange is busy with the delivery of this month's futures. It is said that there will be a special preparation for delivery today, and it should be possible to get the exchange's permission. It is estimated that the total spot transaction for the day was 8,000 yuan, and the futures transaction was nearly 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>Bond Type | Future/Spot | Previous Opening | Closing | Compared to Previous Day | Transaction Volume</p>

<p>The prices in parentheses in the table above are the suspended bidding prices.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower Yarn Market is Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>The yarn market is relatively firm and the situation is tight, because the demand for spot yarn is becoming more and more smooth. The Guangdong and Tianjin gangs have very strong intentions. As for the gold price hovering at the 800 tael mark, the morale is relatively strong. The Osaka Sanpin yarn is trending upward, and the silver calculation is still more than 210 taels. Therefore, some people are thinking about buying expensive coarse yarn, and the Guangdong gang is also actively purchasing. However, the selling side still has a lot of pressure due to rumors about the situation. This month is the last day, and the market atmosphere is relatively calm. However, the two sides of receipt and delivery are as high as 12,300 bales. Guangdong receives 12 bales. If the actual sales of the yarn market can continue to be uninterrupted, the yarn market has a promising future.</p>
<p>The human standard is trending upward. The opening of the human standard in the morning market was very tired due to the fall of American cotton, and there was selling pressure. However, the retail air strike market did not fall far and rose by two, three or four qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the guest gang was receiving goods this month, and the guest's spot yarn transactions were smooth, and the market atmosphere suddenly became strong, rising seven or eight qian each. The transaction was estimated at 23,800 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 2,250 bales and Gengfeng sold 1,900 bales. Gengfeng bought 900 bales, Dachang bought 1,300 bales, and Tianlong bought 500 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left. The closing price of the human standard is the amount of increase or decrease in the account. The price of the human standard is the closing amount of increase or decrease in the account.</p>

<p>Yarn sales are more active. The spot yarn sales are smoother. It is estimated that all gangs bought 3,695 bales throughout the day. Colleagues entered 370 bales. The market was stable. Among the guest gangs, Guangdong entered 1,600 bales, Tianjin entered 800 bales, the mainland entered 100 bales, Sichuan entered 450 bales, Changsha entered 50 bales, Shantou entered 65 bales, Nanyang entered 65 bales, Yunnan entered 160 bales, the North gang entered 130 bales, Hankou entered 100 bales, Ningbo entered 65 bales, Jiangxi entered 50 bales, and various gangs entered 150 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Is Showing A Good Outlook Again</h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm again because the exchange rate is difficult to ease and major players are receiving goods. Although the foreign cotton market is falling, the silver calculation is still difficult to import in large quantities, so the multi-party pull is still tight. The sources of each road are lacking, but the sales of spot cotton are very clear.</p>
<p>The Han standard rose by three or four qian. The opening of the Han standard in the morning market was relatively firm, rising five minutes to one and a half qian each. In the afternoon, it rose by two qian and five minutes. The transaction was estimated at 34,400 dan. It was found that Yu Chang sold 2,200 dan, Jifeng sold 1,400 dan, and Gengfeng sold 1,200 dan. Huai Yu Chang bought 4,200 dan, Shen Chang bought 1,000 dan, and Changfeng bought 1,400 dan. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Declined and Sanpin Rebounded</h3>
<p>American cotton is still trending downstream. Yesterday, American cotton was tired at first due to good weather, then it was firm due to short covering, and finally it fell again due to the weakness of Wall Street. It is estimated that futures fell 9 to 12 pounds and spot fell 10 pounds. British cotton futures fell 29 points and spot fell 30 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell 25 points. The Indian cotton market was weak. It is estimated that Pingguor fell one rupee, Omlara did not move, and Bairoxi fell two rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (26th telegram).</p>

<h3>Private Estimate of American Cotton Fields</h3>
<p>26th New York telegram Fan Queer's announced estimate of the current cotton field is 40983000 acres, an increase of 161000 acres compared to the last time (April 23).</p>
<h3>The Grain Guest Xian Market is Lonely</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grain market was quite deserted. There were no transactions for Xianggan rice. The newly arrived Wuhu rice was also not traded because the negotiations were not proper. The market only had a small number of train rice to match the customers, and the prices were not made public. Therefore, there were no only bag transactions in the market. It was actually because the current inventory had long been exhausted, and the hoarders were hoarding their goods, but the customers lacked the stomach. This street was waiting and watching, and even rejected foreign rice. Since the gold price was expensive, it was difficult to divide the return of the goods, and the asking price was too high, and the importers were unwilling to accept it.</p>
<h3>The Standard Powder is Trending Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the powder market in the morning, the market for each month was better due to the better quotations for foreign wheat, about four or five jiao. The gold price was still outside 800 taels, so although the weather was clear and smooth, the people's hearts were quite stable. Fortunately, the actual sales gangs were waiting and watching as before, and the foreign multi-party was inevitably a little worried. Each session in the morning was about a point better than the previous day's closing price. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the mainland gangs, in view of the smooth and clear weather, generally believed that the new wheat harvest was not a big problem, so the market atmosphere was flat and the opening price was slightly relaxed. The ups and downs after this observation have a huge relationship with the gold market. If the exchange rate is long, foreign wheat flour can be ordered. As a result, this month was a small two and a half li better than the previous day, June was unchanged, July and August were two and a half li better, September was five points better, and October was one point and two and a half li better.</p>
<h3>Future Wheat is Close to Weakness and Distant Stability</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the future wheat market showed a near-fall and distant-stable trend after the opening in the afternoon. Because this month is the last day, the general floating multi-party thought that this was an opportunity and wanted to squeeze, but the market soared by two or three qian. All those with actual goods were willing to deliver at the exchange, so at this time of near end, there were more sellers than buyers. The floating multi-party without strength had to settle with the market, so the market fell miserably. This situation was unexpected by the multi-party outside the industry. The distant contracts were still carrying interest, and the entrances and exits were mutually visible due to the gold price relationship. The subsequent steps such as the new wheat harvest were still good. The market may return to a little harmony. As a result, this month plummeted by one qian compared to the previous day, June fell two points, July fell one point, August was one point better, and September was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Bran Market is Very Excited</h3>
<p>Japanese Flour Mill Was Burned Down, Japanese Merchants Are Crazy to Cover Short Positions</p>
<p>The bran market was still peaceful in the morning of the previous week. For example, Fufeng bran had opened at 2 taels, 5 qian, 7 fen and a half in June. Because of the news that the Japanese flour mill was burned down, the people's hearts suddenly became agitated, and the opening was high to 2 taels, 6 qian and a half to 2 taels and 7 qian. By the time the price was opened yesterday, the hearts of the association were unusually agitated, because the burning of the Japanese factory had been confirmed, and the Japanese merchants were also crazy to cover their short positions, so they repeatedly shouted to 2 taels and 7 qian and a half. According to people in the industry, the sales of the Japanese side will definitely increase, and there is still a trend to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Slight Increase in Transactions of Raw and White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from producing regions indicated that the spot price of Cuban sugar remained unchanged. New York sugar futures for all months experienced a slight decline. Java spot sugar remained stable. In the public market, Dutch sugar No. 24 raw and white sugar saw active buying, with the transaction price at 11.2 taels. Hong Kong goods were priced at 11.15 taels, with about a thousand bags changing hands. The market sentiment remained firm. No. 20 medium-grade white sugar saw quieter trading at 10.07 taels. No. 10 Dutch red sugar remained steady and popular at 9.7 taels. Initially, Japanese sugar was quoted at a high price, but buyers generally hesitated. Eventually, N sugar was traded at 11.2 taels, YT at 11.15 taels, YRO at 10.065 taels, and Minghua goods at 10.07 taels. T sugar was quoted at 11.6 taels, but there were few takers.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hainan Dried Longan Prices Rising</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of Hainan dried longan has been sporadic, and stocks are low. Additionally, signs of a poor harvest are becoming apparent. Consequently, market prices are steadily increasing. Previously, goods priced at 32 taels were available; now, they are offered at 37 taels, with only a small quantity available for occasional transactions, and sellers are unwilling to sell off their entire stock. Market sentiment suggests prices will continue to rise, potentially reaching 40 taels before stabilizing.</p>
<h3>Dried Longan: Decision to Increase Pricing</h3>
<p>This year's new dried longan crop is expected to be poor, and existing stocks are low. Land prices are also rising. Although wholesale prices have increased slightly, they are still insufficient to cover costs. Yesterday, the industry association convened a meeting of various businesses and resolved to increase prices to maintain profitability and avoid losses. The new prices are as follows: Top grade - 34 taels, Premium grade - 26 taels, Superior grade - 20 taels, Wholesale grade - 14 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms' Silk Market Remains Lifeless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market for foreign firms in this port remained lifeless. European and American markets are flooded with rayon, and Japanese silk is priced even cheaper. Reports indicate that Chinese silk is considered too expensive and trading remains sluggish. Yesterday, only Dachang imported 15 bales of unbleached silk and Kechang imported 8 bales of low-grade yellow silk. Prices remain weak.</p>
<h3>Changxing Cocoon Merchants Open Scales</h3>
<p>Cocoon yield is less than 40%, cocoon price is more than 40 yuan.</p>
<p>This year's early and late silkworms in Changxing, Hongxing, Xuchang, Niudian, Lincheng, Xiayuan Ferry, Jiapu, and other places have suffered from cold rain, resulting in a 60% loss. The new cocoons have already entered the market, but the total harvest is less than 40%. Only eight or nine cocoon merchants, such as Yucheng and Xintai, have opened their scales. The market arrival of goods was very limited in the beginning. Due to the sunny weather in recent days, the quality of cocoons is not good. The initial price was thirty-four or five yuan and has now reached forty yuan. Improved varieties of high-quality cocoons opened at forty-two or three yuan.</p>
<h3>Danyang Late Silkworms Delayed in Mounting Frames</h3>
<p>Farmers focus on supplemental heating, expecting only 30% of the harvest. Due to the cold and rainy weather this year, the early silkworm crop in Danyang's various market towns was completely lost. Farmers supplemented with late silkworms, but the weather remained adverse, with temperatures often around 60 degrees. During the silkworms' dormancy and peak feeding period, continuous rain caused many to turn yellow and die. When mounting the frames, the silkworms were timid and did not come out. Farmers focused on supplemental heating, but the weather remained cold, and thunderstorms further hindered the silkworms' ability to spin silk. The expected cocoon harvest is no more than 30%. Only one-tenth of the usual number of cocoon merchants have registered and prepared to open their scales.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Sales to Europe Suddenly Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the European market sales of Qimen and other black teas in this port's foreign tea firms suddenly became slow, and recognized prices were lower than before. Chinese tea merchants, having profited handsomely in the previous round and facing limited supplies from Eyan, maintained a very firm attitude, leading to even more sparse trading. Although there was no major development in Zhenmei green tea from Tuzhuang and Luzhuang, the Jinxing foreign firm showed particularly strong interest in the market yesterday, pushing the top price of Sui'an Zhenmei back up to 135 taels, leaving the market uncertain.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan New Tea Merchants Enthusiastically Open Scales</h3>
<p>In Wuyuan County, tea merchants have been enthusiastically opening scales for new tea, which has been eagerly sought after by various firms in recent days. The middle, lower, and northern tea gardens have been snapped up in the past few days. Today, the opening price in Zhongbei Zhutan and Xikeng villages was 55 yuan, not significantly higher than yesterday's market. In Shangbei and the areas bordering Xiuning and Zhejiang's Zheyuan, such as Zhangqian, Ziwu, and Huaqiao, tea bud development has been delayed due to the high and extremely cold mountains, and about one-third of the mountain households have yet to finish picking. Half of the eastern and western routes have also opened their scales in recent days. In the past, merchants found it difficult to approach the southern mountain households due to the high prices. Now, tea households in Yutan and Caomen areas bordering Dexing in the outer south, fearing a resurgence of bandit activity in the nearby Jiangxi province, making Haikou precarious, and fearing that merchants would not dare to trade, leading to stockpiling and falling prices, have unanimously sought to sell off their stock. Therefore, in the last two days, villages such as Yutan, Caomen, Caojiawan, Songcun, Wudian, and Qingshui Harbor have negotiated and agreed to open their scales, with prices ranging from 37 to 43 yuan. Various tea firms in Sisi and other places in northern Wuyuan, seeing that new tea has opened in the southern routes and they still have abundant stocks, have sent personnel to purchase tea there.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Winter Goods Selling Remarkably Well</h3>
<p>The piece goods market has been thriving in recent days. While summer goods remain stable, winter goods such as direct tribute flannel, direct tribute satin, and fine broadcloth are experiencing a surge in demand. Sales to out-of-town merchants are also very smooth. The rapid rise in gold prices has led to widespread price increases, prompting widespread sourcing of available goods. Yesterday, direct tribute flannel from the Four Gentlemen brand was the most popular, with over 200 pieces sold to merchants from the Yangtze River and Qingdao, with prices rising from three taels to three taels and five li. Moganshan "Hunting Goose" and Sanyou brands each rose two and a half li. Various businesses offered 250 pieces of Sanyou brand at a price of three taels and three fen. Fine broadcloth from Gucheng was most popular in Huixiao. Merchants from the Yangtze River and this street purchased over 100 pieces at a price of three taels and nine fen. The long-unavailable Baoqiu brand was restocked and sold at four taels. Sanyou brand broadcloth was actively sought after by merchants from the Yangtze River and Yunnan, causing prices to soar. Plain yuan sold for three taels one fen and seven li, assorted colors for three taels two fen, and plain blue-gray for three taels two and a half fen. Huxinting remained at three taels and three fen. Direct tribute satin continued to become scarce. The existing inventory of Luyingting and Sanyou brands was very limited. The first work sold for three taels and five and a half fen, and Zhuhu sold at three taels and one and a half fen. However, while white crepe, foreign yarn, printed linen yarn, and other items were in season, their price increases were relatively small. Striped government silk was in very short supply.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Dramatic Increase in Tung Oil Exports</h3>
<p>Relating to the Increased Tax, All July and August Futures Must be Settled</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the new export tariff, the tung oil tax rate has increased from 4.5 qian to 1.6 taels, causing panic among tung oil merchants in this port, Hankou, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and other places. They have all sent telegrams to the financial authorities, appealing for a reduction in the tax rate to protect foreign trade. However, the authorities have not indicated whether the tax rate will be changed. The goods sold off by merchants in Hankou and Shanghai are not yet due. If they are taxed according to the new regulations, the losses will be substantial. Therefore, they are all advancing the delivery and export of goods to this month. It is said that Hankou alone will need to deliver about 10,000 tons this month. Since the July and August futures are all settled in one go, the spot oil will naturally be temporarily under pressure. The market has also improved, rising from 20 taels and three or four qian to 20 taels and seven or eight qian. The accumulated goods in the Hankou market can also take this opportunity to be cleared, so that there is no risk of being completely full. In this port, in order to expedite the delivery to foreign firms, they have been actively searching for spot oil in Hangzhou for days, and the price has also risen to 31 yuan per dan transported to Shanghai. According to yesterday's letter from Hangzhou, the market has stabilized. The people who need goods have generally purchased them, and the spot oil can be expected to become more popular. However, since the oil stored in various places has been substantially reduced this time, the underlying accumulation is no longer as thick as before. From now on, it can be hoped that it will be stable and there will be no risk of cheap prices.</p>
<h3>Metals: Import of English Tinplate is Quite Strong</h3>
<p>The import of English tinplate has been quite crowded recently. Fortunately, the outlet is smooth, and there is no worry of the market being full of goods. Yesterday, Xintaigu Warehouse in Pudong arrived with another 5,670 boxes of spot goods. Among them, 90-pound double-transported goods are the most numerous, followed by English Huisi iron, followed by 90-pound single-transported goods. The market price in this port originally wanted to be lowered. Because the exchange rate of the recent English currency often shrinks, the cost is raised invisibly. Therefore, the market can still maintain the price. At this time, the double-transported goods are sold at 32 taels, the single-transported goods are at 15 taels and 7.5 qian, the English Huisi iron is at 28 taels and 5 qian, and the 100-pound goods are at 16 taels and 2.5 qian. It is heard that 600-700 boxes were opened yesterday. The purchasers are both Tianjin and Hankou.</p>

<h3>Talking About the Affairs of the French Court</h3>
<p>It Is Abolished Rather Than Reorganized and Returned</p>
<p>Because This Court Was Originally Established by the French</p>
<p>Negotiations for the abolition of the Shanghai French Concession Mixed Court, with the Chinese government appointing Wu Kunwu, Advisor to the Judicial Yuan, and Xu Mo, Director of the Department of European and American Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The French side appointed Le Gall, Counselor of the French Legation, and Gan Gelin, Consul General of Shanghai. After the four people were appointed as members of the negotiating committee, it has been more than a month and there is no definite date for the start of negotiations. It is now known that Wu Kunwu, a member of the Chinese negotiating team, came to Shanghai a few days ago due to business.</p>
<p>Visiting the French Court, Mr. Wu went to the French Mixed Court on Xuhuali Road in the French Concession yesterday morning to visit. He was greeted by the three trial judges, Zhu Qi, Gong Xiang, and Tang Zaili. Mr. Wu entered the living room for a moment, and then accompanied them to visit the first and second courts and the Procuratorate for a week before shaking hands and leaving. The reporter of the New Sound Agency paid a special visit, and now records his remarks on the situation of this negotiation as follows:</p>
<p>Abolishing the Court, according to Mr. Wu, the negotiations on the French Court cannot be called reorganization, nor can they be called recovery, because the meaning of reorganization or recovery actually contains that the court was originally ours, and was invaded by others, and now we want to reorganize or recover it. Now it is found that the French Court was not established by China, but by the French side. Therefore, it wants to abolish it and set up a court in China.</p>
<p>Negotiation Time, when asked by reporters about the date of the start of negotiations, the answer was that although it has not been determined yet, it is not far away. The reason why the negotiations have been delayed is because the French negotiator Le Gall was unable to come because of the counselor's temporary inability. Because French ambassador Wei Liden came to Beijing from the south to negotiate French rights, all affairs of the French embassy are handled by the counselor. Although the French side appointed the counselor as a member of the French Court negotiating committee, he was unable to come to Shanghai immediately due to the affairs of the embassy. It is expected that the counselor will come south to start negotiations after the French ambassador returns to Beijing.</p>
<p>Future Organization, the reporter asked again about the measures after the court is abolished and its future organization. According to the answer, according to the government's opinion, after the abolition, a new court will be established, and the internal organization will be completely organized in accordance with the latest Chinese laws and court measures. However, how the negotiations will proceed in the future cannot be predicted now, so the measures after the abolition and the situation of its internal organization still depend on the extent of future negotiations.</p>
<p>A Brief History of the Court, according to Wu's talk about the past situation of the Shanghai French Court, the French Court is actually different from the Mixed Court in the former Public Concession. The former Public Concession Mixed Court was established by the Chinese government, and foreign consuls could appear in court for joint trials. Therefore, the negotiations at that time said reorganization or recovery. The French Court is not the case. The court was originally established by the French side. The Chinese judges in it were also hired by the French side, not appointed by the Chinese government. In the beginning, because the French Concession was very small, there was no court. In the event of civil and criminal lawsuits, etc., it was only handled in the reception room of the French Consulate. At that time, the Qing court also appointed a judge to be stationed there permanently. Almost until 1914, the French side signed a treaty with the Beijing government to expand the scope of the French Concession, and the French leader established a court until today, which has been 20 years. The government has never asked about it. Now the National Government is eager to abolish it and set up a purely Chinese court.</p>
<h3>Recent News of Chinese Steamers on the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Continued Suspension of Navigation: On the 17th of this month, the Chinese merchant steamers in Shanghai that were scheduled to suspend the first batch of services included two steamers each from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Sanbei Shipping Company, two Tongyang liner services, and the Ning Shao and Kuaili to suspend services and go to Ganzhou and Hankou to carry troops to the front to suppress bandits.</p>
<p>Retaining Ships for Scheduled Services: In order to meet the needs of passengers and merchants, the shipping companies consulted with the Department of Transportation. As a result, two upper-river paddle steamers were transferred to Shanghai to provide services, causing a sudden improvement in the Chinese ships on the Yangtze River route due to the reduction of imports and exports from Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nisshin Shipping.</p>
<p>Obstruction of Passengers and Goods: This time, the ships were dispatched to transport a large number of passengers and goods to Shanghai, but they were instructed to go to Hankou when they arrived in Jiujiang, causing all goods on board to be obstructed. Other companies' ships had already booked the cabin space tonnage, and the passengers and goods were ready to be loaded, but they were suddenly suspended, causing the stranded people to send telegrams to Shanghai to negotiate with the company almost every day.</p>
<p>Shao Wei, Director of the Transportation Department of the Pukou Management Headquarters, issued a notice to the shipping companies in this port, roughly saying that the deployment of ships has been specially assigned by this department to Mr. Yang Chizhong and the Pukou organized ship management office. This time, the commercial ships to be deployed are all under the control of Pukou, and the rent to be paid is also handled by the office. This department is in a supervisory position, hoping that the shipping companies will directly contact the office. Therefore, most of the ships suspended this time and entering Hunan have already arrived in Pukou to await orders.</p>
<p>Avoiding the New Export Tax on June 1st</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Chinese Goods are Shipped to Japan</h3>
<p>Nippon Yusen Kaisha Adds Vessels and Schedules Extra Sailings</p>
<p>Shipments to Europe and America are Also Congested</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance originally set the implementation date for the revised export tariff on April 1st. Due to the tight deadline and requests from various parties, it was extended by two months. Now, the implementation date is not far away. Jiang Customs has issued a notice that starting from June 1st, the customs duties on all export goods should be levied according to the revised new rate. Starting from the 10th of this month, Japanese buyers of Chinese goods who have not yet shipped the goods sent a telegram to Shanghai, ordering the merchants handling the goods to export the goods they had purchased before May 31st, regardless of whether they had arrived in Shanghai, in advance to avoid the new tax rate. After the telegram arrived in Shanghai, the Yangtze River goods were rushed to Shanghai by Nisshin Steamship. The merchants also consulted with Nippon Yusen Kaisha to assign this batch of goods to be shipped to Japan to Nippon Yusen Kaisha to arrange for ships to carry them. In the past two weeks, Nippon Yusen Kaisha first dispatched eleven ships to transport the goods to Osaka, Kobe, and Yokohama. Recently, ships such as Ikomamaru, Kasagimaru, Mikasaru, Rokkomaru, Asomaru, and Mayamaru have left Shanghai with all the Chinese goods they carried. As June 1st is approaching, there are still 20,000 to 30,000 tons of goods to be shipped to Japan. The Japanese merchants also agreed with Nippon Yusen Kaisha to add four more ships, Tai'anmaru, Tsukubamaru, and Yamashiromaru, to Shanghai to rush to transport a large number of rapeseed, eggs, soybean cake, rapeseed cake, blue ramie, paper umbrellas, etc. to be loaded by the end of the month. According to Nippon Yusen Kaisha, the congestion of goods shipped from Shanghai to Japan this month is rare on weekdays, increasing more than three times compared to the same period last year. In these two weeks, more than 100,000 tons of Chinese native products were shipped to Japan. Also, in the past two weeks, the export goods to Europe and America have been loaded to the fullest extent by the various ships that have not been fully loaded for a long time due to the rush of merchants to load tax-avoiding goods.</p>
<h3>Five Communists Arrested</h3>
<p>Three Sent to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court</p>
<p>Two Sent to the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>The Central Police Station of the Public Concession has recently received several confidential reports stating that a large number of Communists from Hunan and Hubei have sneaked into Shanghai, hiding in Yizhi Lane on Kangnao Road and Tongyi Hotel on Zhejiang Road, plotting to cause trouble. The head of the police station, according to the report, dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the area to make arrests. As a result, five people, including Gui Yangzhi, were arrested at the address. A large number of reactionary exhibits were seized and brought to the police station for interrogation. As a result, the evidence of the three people, including Gui, who were found in Yizhi Lane, was conclusive. The Second Branch of the Higher Court will open the trial on the 14th of next month. The two people arrested in Tongyi Hotel, one named Xu Jinshan and one named Lu Chang, were found on the spot in the room. A letter, a letter, was seized. The letter was written in ordinary classical Chinese with ink. The wording was extremely simple. After repeated research by the police station, soaking it in a certain medicine revealed an extremely clear secret order from the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters immediately prepared a document and sent personnel to the Special Zone Court to bring the case to the court. The Special Zone Court initially hesitated, but after providing sufficient evidence, the court handed it over to the staff to bring it back for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Question of Convening a Silver Price Conference</h3>
<p>Zhang Jia'ao's Talk</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Bank of China, talked to the reporter of the Great Evening News yesterday about the silver price conference, saying that the cause of convening a silver price conference to determine the silver price was proposed by our representative Bei Zuyi and passed by the International Chamber of Commerce Congress. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that if the countries concerned have no willingness to implement the resolutions of the silver price conference, then the meaning of this movement is very limited. Therefore, the first step is to seek the opinions of countries related to the decline in silver prices such as Japan, India, and Mexico. However, recently, the Guangdong Incident occurred, and the National Government is striving to maintain peace and unity. This issue has been temporarily put on hold. The banking community in this port is very concerned about this matter and is still continuing to discuss it. However, the actual preparation for convening the banking conference must wait until Representative Bei returns to China from Europe before it can be handled. Representative Bei is currently in Europe inviting dignitaries from various countries to support this matter, and he is expected to return to China from Siberia in early autumn.</p>
<h3>The Two-Way Military Transportation Bureau was Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yu Feipeng Returned to Beijing Last Night to Report</p>
<p>Yu Feipeng, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Transportation, was recently ordered by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to come to Shanghai to organize the Two-Way Military Transportation Bureau of Jinghu and Huhangyong. He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and contacted the heads of the Two-Way Bureaus of Jinghu and Huhangyong, Luo Panhui, about the organization matters. Mr. Luo allocated Room 4 on the second floor of the Two-Way Administration Bureau as the office of the Military Transportation Bureau yesterday morning, and promised that if there was a need for housing, it could be moved at any time. Mr. Yu immediately appointed several staff members such as Jiang Zhongchuan, Miao Qixian, Wu Zaiting, and Song Qingchen to start work immediately. He himself took the 12:00 midnight train to Beijing that night to report. It is heard that Mr. Yu will still return to Shanghai in a few days to formally take office as the Director of the Two-Way Military Transportation Bureau.</p>
<h3>Export Industry Asks to Abolish the New Tariff</h3>
<p>Increase by Three or Four Times, It is Difficult to Bear</p>
<p>The Export Industry Association sent a telegram to the National Government, the President of the Judicial Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance the day before yesterday, saying (the title is omitted). The Shanghai Jiang Customs announcement of the new tariff for export goods states that wool is taxed at two taels per dan, and goat hair is taxed at one tael and four qian and five fen per dan, which is three to four times greater than the old tariff. Other various animal skins must be estimated according to the market price, valuing 75% of the value, etc. The export industry was shocked to hear this. The export of native goods in our country, in terms of its original quality, is similar to luxury goods, sold overseas to absorb cash, which is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is indeed not shallow. The government should reduce the tariff to encourage and promote it. How can it increase the tariff, making the export business fall into hundreds of robberies? Moreover, the export of various animal skins and wool to countries such as Russia and Japan is currently in competition with our country. The governments of those countries exempt tariffs on this type of export of native goods to maintain and promote it, so the cost is lighter than our country, and trade can naturally develop day by day. The export of native goods in our country has a higher cost, and the attack on them has been repeatedly seen in recent years. If we are determined to follow the newly established tariff, the export of wool will be in a dangerous state, not to mention. The disputes over the valuation and taxation of various animal skins will be seen repeatedly, harming merchants and damaging the country, which is no different from causing the export business to die immediately. The government should take into account the difficult situation of the export of native goods and make every effort to maintain foreign trade, and will never crush the export business in the midst of wind and rain. For this reason, we urgently telegraph this to request the government to quickly request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to telegraph Jiang Customs to abolish the new tariff for the export of fur and native goods. In addition to various animal skins that have no fixed tariff, we request that they be clearly defined from light to follow. For the rest that have tax regulations, we beg you to still follow the old regulations and precedents to preserve the remaining breath of the export business. We are extremely grateful and urgently telegraph you with trepidation. Lu Qinglai, Chairman of the Export Industry Association at No. 1 Beihai Road, Shanghai, etc.</p>
<h3>Import Tax on Glass and Magnetic Instruments</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs to Request a Reduction</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing Education, Finance, and Industry Departments yesterday, saying that it received a letter from the Scientific Instrument Museum on the 26th of this month stating that scientific instruments are diverse, and most of them are distinguished as metal, porcelain, and glass. Those with basic knowledge of physics and chemistry can know that porcelain and glass are the most consumed in physical and chemical experiments. Since the revision of the import tariff, scientific instruments are included in the fifth category, and only 75% of the ad valorem is levied. Those with volume are even less than this number, and we see that the government is promoting education and revitalizing industry. However, after careful analysis, only scientific instruments belonging to the metal category are included in the fifth category. If porcelain and glass are not included, and their higher grades must be purchased from abroad, especially those that are finely made and valuable, the tax rate should be reduced to promote academics. The current import tariff for porcelain is 40% in Category 14, No. 576 of the tariff, and glass is taxed from 15% to 30% in Category 584 of the same category. At the time, the revision of this type of tariff focused on protecting domestic goods and did not take into account the physical and chemical instruments that are related to academics and must be supplied by others. Therefore, when the museum first saw that the tax on scientific instruments was not heavy, it did not take into account that most of the products that do not belong to metal products are the majority. It was not until the magnetic evaporation dish was shipped from Germany and taxed at 40%, and the glass beakers shipped from Japan were taxed at 20%, which is equivalent to the luxury tax, that we realized that this was not the government's intention to promote education and revitalize industry. Therefore, we have specially prepared the supporting documents and submitted them to the National Central Research Institute for verification. We also respectfully request your association to quickly forward them to the three departments of Industry, Education, and Finance to order the tax authorities to review and revise the tax, which should not exceed the rate of 75% of the ad valorem price of scientific instruments in metal products, and to order the customs to verify and refund the previous tax paid by the museum, so that it can be sold at a cheap price to conform to the government's emphasis on education and industry. The council believes that the science of physics and chemistry is still in its infancy in our country's academics, and we should strive to make progress and improve. Therefore, the schools are trying to improve the equipment of physical and chemical instruments, which is the most important task for revitalizing academics today. If the cost increases due to high taxes, it will be more difficult to seek complete equipment when the schools' expenses are stretched. This is enough to hinder the progress of academics, and it is not only related to the prosperity of the physical and chemical business, but the council is planning to maintain it repeatedly, thinking that the museum's request to reduce the tax rate on glass and magnetic instruments is indeed reasonable. However, the import tariff No. 576 is generally called porcelain, and No. 584 is generally called glass, so the higher-grade household items and academic supplies are included. It seems that we should consider ways to divide them to ensure that the protection of domestic goods and the encouragement of academics do not interfere with each other. You have a high and long-term vision and should have the right to weigh the situation. We should telegraph to request a review and approval to handle it, which is for the public benefit. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce begs your forgiveness.</p>
<h3>Egg Factories are Subject to Two Types of Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Replies to the City Chamber of Commerce Letter</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance replied to the City Chamber of Commerce by telegram yesterday regarding the matter of egg factories being subject to two types of business tax: manufacturing and sales. The City Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai is pleased to learn from your telegram that various egg merchants purchase fresh eggs in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, and other provinces, and set up factories locally to manufacture dried and wet egg yolks and whites. Although they only purchase and do not engage in sales business, they are different from ordinary villagers who only buy and do not sell. They are considered a manufacturing industry and should be taxed locally at a rate of 5 per 1,000 of the capital amount according to the manufacturing industry business tax regulations. When they are transported to Shanghai for sales in various businesses, they should still be taxed according to the sales amount. The tax rate will be determined after the Shanghai Municipal Government sends the draft of the Shanghai Municipal Business Tax Collection Regulations to the Ministry for review and approval. In addition to ordering the financial halls of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, and Hubei to follow these regulations, this notice is hereby issued for your information. Ministry of Finance Seal</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Revises Office Hours</h3>
<p>The office hours of the municipal government and its affiliated departments and bureaus were originally set from 9:00 am to 12:00 noon and from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm every day. Recently, due to the gradual warming of the weather, starting from June 1, the office hours will be changed to 8:00 am to 12:00 noon and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm every day as usual. It is heard that the order has been distributed to various departments for compliance.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Registers Unemployed Workers; Otherwise, They Will Not Be Entitled to Priority Employment Rights.</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to review the qualifications of unemployed union members, has designated the Third Section to handle registration matters and issued a notice yesterday, stating that:</p>
<p>In view of the fact that labor-management agreements in various industries in this city often stipulate the priority employment of union members in the industry, the original intention is undoubtedly to protect innocent unemployed workers. However, a small number of unscrupulous workers take advantage of this as a shield, often creating trouble and gradually infringing upon the management rights of the employers. Therefore, this notice is hereby published to inform all unemployed members of various unions in this city to obtain and fill out the unemployed worker registration form from this Bureau and register in accordance with the regulations. Unemployed union members who have not passed the review will not be entitled to the priority employment rights stipulated in the labor-management agreement. Please comply with this directive and do not delay and harm yourselves.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Abolishes Free Tickets</h3>
<p>Since Guo Waifeng took office as the new General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, in addition to implementing organizational downsizing and laying off a large number of employees, he issued another notice yesterday to abolish free tickets for all ships. The notice is as follows:</p>
<p>On the 16th of this month, Order No. 139 was received from the General Management Office, instructing compliance. It is hereby ordered that the free tickets for all ships of this Bureau have long been abolished. Bureau staff members who are on official duty or on leave to return to their hometowns may be given a boarding pass by the Bureau, but only for their own use. Those who apply for leave to return to their hometowns are only allowed two round trips per year. Moreover, the business directors of each ship, in addition to collecting food expenses, will not be allowed to offset passenger fares. Furthermore, first-class tickets will only be offered to senior military officers and senior Bureau staff for special hospitality, and no discounts or exemptions will be granted to any other personnel. This was stipulated in Order No. 758 issued on August 18th of the 18th year. It has now been found that the number of staff members in various sections and departments who apply for boarding passes is gradually increasing, and there are also those who are not traveling themselves and whose number of applications exceeds the fixed number of round trips, resulting in substantial business losses. In the future, if staff members apply for boarding passes due to leave to return to their hometowns, they shall still comply with Order No. 758 and shall not obstruct business operations in any way. This is of utmost importance. This is hereby ordered for all to comply with. This notice is hereby issued by the Business Department on May 27th of the 20th year.</p>
<h3>Women's Organizations Study Factory Law</h3>
<p>Every Wednesday, visits to various factories and lectures will be held.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the National Government has stipulated that the Factory Law and the Regulations for the Implementation of the Factory Law will be implemented from August 1st, women's organizations in this city have decided to hold discussions and promote implementation. Starting yesterday, every Wednesday, they will visit various factories and invite celebrities to give lectures for research purposes, limited to four weeks. Yesterday, representatives from eleven organizations, including the Young Women's Christian Association, the National Association of Young Women's Christian Associations, the Women's Relief Association, the Women's Temperance Association, the Women's Auxiliary Association, the Women's Suffrage Association, the Charity Association, the Christian Association, the Puyi Society, and the Moore Memorial Church, visited the Tianchang Silk Reeling Factory on Zhangjiaxiang Road, Hongkou, in the morning. In the afternoon, they invited Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau to give a lecture on "The Government's Plan for Implementing the Factory Law" and Mr. Chen Da to give a lecture on "The Protection of Child Labor and Female Labor." It is reported that the second session will be held at 3:00 PM on June 3rd, when Ms. Hou Dazhuang, a worker from the Labor Union, and Ms. Sun Miaoying will be invited to give lectures. The third session will be held on the morning of June 10th, when Zhu Maocheng will give a lecture and visit various factories. The fourth session will be a full discussion on June 17th.</p>
<h3>Report on the Preparation for the Issuance of Notes by the Four Banks</h3>
<p>The 73rd Notice</p>
<p>The Four Banks Preparation Treasury is jointly established by the Yanye, Jincheng, Zhongnan, and Dalu Banks to specifically handle the issuance of Zhongnan Bank notes. The 73rd notice of the Shanghai Preparation Treasury on May 23rd of the 20th year is as follows:</p>

<h3>Official of the Anti-Drug Association Talks About the Sealing of the Hunan Anti-Drug Association</h3>
<p>There is no affiliation with this association.</p>
<p>The reason for the sealing may be a frame-up.</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the news of the sealing of the Hunan Anti-Drug Association by the Changsha Headquarters has aroused great attention from all circles. According to an important official of the China Guomin Anti-Drug Association, the Hunan Anti-Drug Association was initiated and organized by local people and has only been in preparation for a few months. The preparatory committee has sent letters to inquire about the organizational methods and request various assistance. This association has instructed them to operate in accordance with the local anti-drug organization outline, which is very strict. However, local anti-drug organizations that have not been directly organized by this association and joined by major local legal entities have not been recognized. The Hunan Anti-Drug Association is still in preparation, and the details have not been formally reported. As for the reason for the sealing, it is unknown, as the association has no affiliation with this association, and this association cannot be responsible for any actions. However, the allegations in the newspaper, such as being used by the Communist bandits and seeking wealth under false pretenses, are untrue. The Special Merchants Association organized by local merchants in Hunan has always been deeply resentful of the anti-drug movement. This incident is likely a frame-up. If the report is true, the authorities will be requested to take action to maintain the anti-drug movement. If it is a frame-up, assistance will be given out of sympathy. This association is awaiting detailed news and will take appropriate measures. It should be noted that local anti-drug organizations are affiliated to this association in spirit but not in organization. It is feared that various circles do not understand the truth. The Standing Committee has repeatedly resolved that local anti-drug organizations shall not use the name of anti-drug branch to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>Date for Releasing Reflector Lights on Chen YingShih Memorial Tower</h3>
<p>The Chen YingShih Memorial Tower on Fangbang Bridge stands tall, solemn and dignified. The general public who pass by cannot help but feel admiration. However, at night, the upper part of the tower is not reached by the light from street lamps, so it is still dark. The Municipal Public Works Bureau, in order to make up for this shortcoming, has consulted with the Municipal Engineering Bureau to install four reflector lights with extremely strong intensity, totaling one thousand watts, on the surrounding electric poles. The Shanghai South Lighting Management Office of the Public Works Bureau is responsible for turning on and off the lights. When the lights are turned on, the light shines in all directions, covering the entire tower and creating a spectacular sight. It is now reported that the Bureau has stipulated the following dates for releasing the lights:</p>
<p>(1) January 1st: Founding of the Republic of China Anniversary</p>

<h3>Ma Xiangbo and Others Host Banquet for Hebei National Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>A brief report on the Religious Protection Law was given during the banquet.</p>
<p>Elder statesman Ma Xiangbo and Shanghai gentlemen Zhu Zhiyao, Lu Bohong, and others, in view of the fact that the representatives of the National Assembly of Hebei Province, Liu Junqing, Liu Fenglou, Zhao Zichen, and Ran Pengfei, passed through Shanghai after the closing of the National Assembly, held a banquet at the Dongjiadu Fire Department Hall the night before to welcome them.

Ma Xiangbo delivered a welcoming speech, and Liu Junqing, on behalf of the representatives, reported on their participation in the National Assembly, giving a brief report on the petition to the National Government for the enactment of a Religious Protection Law, stating that since all the people of China have unanimously accepted the late Premier's legacy of national salvation, they should adhere to the principle of protecting religious freedom. Believers of all religions, under the rule of the Party, should adhere to the Three People's Principles, obey the Party's program, promote truth, and promote the development of national culture. It is fortunate that the National Assembly has reviewed and passed the law, and in the future, the property of religious education and religious organizations will be protected by law. Hui Catholic Church and other guests gave speeches in Chinese and other languages, creating a lively atmosphere. A photograph was taken at the end of the event.</p>
<h3>First Batch of "Peugeot" Four-Door Sedans Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>"Peugeot" automobiles, a French product, have now arrived in the first batch of new cars, all of which are the latest 1931 models. According to Mr. Yang Yanhua, manager of the Shanghai Haifeng Automobile Company, "Peugeot" automobiles are small and comfortable, extremely fuel-efficient, and have a ten-horsepower engine. All four wheels are equipped with car brakes, which can be adjusted to different speeds as desired. The ride is smooth and quiet. All of these features are comparable to those of larger cars. Furthermore, "Peugeot" automobiles come in three styles: four-door sedans, two-door sports cars, and luxurious sedans. The prices are extremely low, which is sufficient to defeat all small cars in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>May 30th Cemetery Board Holds Public Memorial Service for Martyrs</h3>

<h3>News from the Gu Jingen Support Association</h3>
<p>The first meeting will be held today.</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Support Association for the Gu Jingen Tragedy is scheduled to hold its first executive committee meeting at the Postal Workers' Union on Xingjiaqiao Road at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Yesterday morning, the Postal Workers' Union sent three representatives, including Zhang Kechang, to report the details of the tragedy to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Taxpayers' Chinese Association, the Lawyers' Association, the Citizens' Federation, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, and other organizations, and to contact them in writing to invite them to attend today's executive committee meeting. According to Mr. Zhang Kechang, all the organizations contacted yesterday expressed sympathy and agreed to participate in the expanded organization.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Passport Inspection Office Inspects Foreign Ships' Crew</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau's Passport Inspection Office for Foreign Affairs has only fifteen field personnel, and only one small vessel from the Water Patrol Team is used for field patrol of ships. As a result, when there are more foreign ships entering port, inspection is inevitably difficult, and omissions sometimes occur. According to the Passport Office, each large foreign ship requires five investigators, while smaller ships require at least three. As foreign ships often enter port during high tide, there are sometimes eight, nine, or even more than ten ships. How can fifteen people be adequately deployed? In addition, foreign ships are berthed as far south as Gaochang Temple or as far north as Wusongkou. The Passport Office has only one small vessel and cannot realistically travel to different locations. Therefore, this situation is extremely difficult. The Office has no choice but to request the Bureau to add ten inspectors to facilitate inspection work.</p>
<h3>Jiangwan and Other Post Offices Stop Sending Parcels</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Inquires About the Reason.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Postal Administration regarding the suspension of large-volume parcel collection at the Jiangwan, Zhoujiaqiao, and Zhenru post offices, stating:</p>
<p>"Respectfully inform you that on the 26th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Postal Transportation Industry Association, stating that on May 16th, members of our association, such as Yuanda Company, reported to the association that the Jiangwan, Zhoujiaqiao, and Zhenru railway stations suddenly stopped collecting large-volume parcels without prior notice, causing postal transportation companies to waste resources transporting parcels, and the unannounced suspension of parcel collection easily causes public suspicion. Please inquire and request early resumption of transportation, etc. Upon receipt, we sent a direct inquiry, but we have not yet received a reply or resumed transportation. Yuanda Company has repeatedly urged us to inquire with the Inland Postal Chief of the Postal Administration and ask when collection will resume to clarify the truth and dispel doubts. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the reason for the suspension of large-volume parcel collection at the Jiangwan, Zhoujiaqiao, Zhenru, and other railway stations and when the original state can be restored are closely related to the postal transportation business. In accordance with the aforementioned letter, we respectfully inquire and request that you investigate and reply for forwarding purposes."</p>

Other articles, such as the labor statistics by Mr. Cai Zhengya and the Chinese flour industry by Mr. Zhang Shuiqi, as well as Bing Jian's translation of "The Revival of European Agriculture," are all important papers in the economic field.

<h3>Record of the Inaugural Meeting of the Woolen Fabric Industry Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Woolen Fabric Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday (27th). More than 100 member representatives attended. The presidium, consisting of Wang Lianfang, Xu Meiqing, and Ge Jichen, was elected. After performing the rituals, Chairman Ge Jichen reported on the process of organizing the industry association, stating that the woolen fabric industry is one of the earliest imported goods with a long history and a large impact on national tax revenue. In the past, when the tariff was 15% of the value, the annual tax revenue was 3 to 4 million taels of silver. If calculated at the current rate of 35% to 45% of the value, it would be more than 10 million. Therefore, the woolen fabric industry has considerable value. Unfortunately, the industry lacks a legal organization and cannot cooperate effectively, resulting in a lack of great performance. This year, the industry initiated the organization of an industry association and obtained permission from the Municipal Party Department to prepare for its establishment, which has finally been completed today. The greatest aspiration of the association is to unite the industry, develop creative capabilities, and fundamentally defeat economic aggression. Representatives of the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce delivered speeches. Guests Wang Xiaolai and Fang Jiaobo spoke successively. The articles of association were adopted, and the executive committee members were elected. The elected members were Fei Rongfu, Chen Meifang, Zhang Jinhuan, Wang Lianfang, Xu Meiqing, Chen Shunan, Ge Jichen, Zhou Qifeng, Wang Changlian, Chen Guteng, Guo Xuefu, Wang Houfu, Liu Liancai, Hong Fuyuan, and Wang Shenghe, totaling fifteen people. The elected executive committee members took their oaths of office, and a photograph was taken before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Local News II</h3>
<h3>Passenger on the Same Car Too Outrageous, Secretly Cuts Off Hair Braid of Young Woman</h3>
<p>Three Thousand Worries Silk, What's Your Business?</p>
<p>Detention for Twenty Days as a Slight Punishment</p>
<p>Around 5:00 PM the other day at the Haige Road tram stop on Jingan Temple Road in West Shanghai, a young woman around twenty-nine years old boarded a tram. Although she looked as beautiful as jade, her attire was still ancient and simple, with a shiny braid hanging down. The passengers in the same car thought that nowadays, cutting hair is popular, especially for women, who must have flying hair to appear more beautiful. This young woman was at the prime of her youth, still dragging a pigtail behind her head. Inevitably, the gaze of the crowd was focused on this woman. Some speculated that she was a village girl, while others suspected that she was a servant. Before long, the bell rang and the car gradually sped up. The psychology of the general guessers disappeared with the dust of the car. Unexpectedly, at this time, when the electric speed was swift, the passenger Cheng Qifeng, a native of Anhui, took advantage of the fact that the passengers in the same car were looking out the window and secretly used a sharp knife to cut off a section of the young woman's braid. When the young woman noticed that a strand of worry silk was already in the hands of others, she couldn't help but raise her willow eyebrows and sternly questioned Cheng Qifeng for the reason for destroying her hair for no reason. Cheng Qifeng was initially at a loss for words and was arrested and detained in the police station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Special Zone Court, where he confessed that he had committed the invasion because he was drunk at the time. Subsequently, Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer of the police station, made a statement, and Judge Luo sentenced the defendant to twenty days of detention as a warning.</p>
<h3>Couplet Contains Morphine</h3>
<p>Mail Inspector Alert</p>
<p>Huang Jing handed over the couplet to the police</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month, Zhang Guangyao, an inspector at the Shanghai Postal Administration Office, discovered a rectangular package sent from Chongqing to Huang Jing of the Wusong Merchant Marine School while inspecting domestic mail. The package contained two couplets that looked suspicious. Inspector Zhang dismantled the wooden shaft of one of the couplets and discovered that the shaft was hollow and completely filled with yellow morphine. He dismantled the other couplet and found that it was also full of morphine. The total amount was dozens of taels. He immediately reported the information to the Postmaster General, who ordered Zhang to take the receipt to the Songhu with the police from the 7th District Public Security Bureau. The school did indeed have a student named Huang Jing living in the school dormitory. Inspector Zhang went to the dormitory and asked Huang if the couplet belonged to him and if he could take the receipt to the post office to pick it up. Huang replied that the couplet was sent by a friend who asked him to collect it on his behalf and that there were two more couplets that were also sent from Sichuan and were now in the box waiting for the friend to pick them up. After speaking, he opened the box, took out the couplet, and gave it to Zhang for inspection. Zhang dismantled the wooden shafts one by one and found that they were also filled with a large amount of morphine. He ordered the police to arrest Huang and take him back to the 7th District, where Chief Zhao Zezhou interrogated him strictly. According to Huang, he was 22 years old, from Chongqing, Sichuan, and a student at the Merchant Marine School. A former classmate in Sichuan, Shi Lanyu Qin, sent him about four couplets last year, which he collected on his behalf. He said that he did not know what was inside the couplet and that he was only helping his friend. After verifying the confession, Chief Zhao prepared a document to transfer Huang to the local court for investigation and prosecution on charges of smuggling drugs. He also ordered Huang to write a quick letter to his friend Lan in Chongqing, stating that the couplet had been received and asking him to come and pick it up quickly. He then sent the letter by post and notified the Merchant Marine School that if anyone came to the school to meet Huang and collect the couplet, they should detain him. Until 10:00 AM yesterday, a fashionable young man came to the Merchant Marine School claiming to visit Huang Jing. The school, having received a notice from the 7th District, sent an employee to meet him and asked him for his name and the reason for visiting Huang. The young man identified himself as Lan Yuqin, a fellow villager of Huang, and said that he had come to pick up the couplet that had been sent to Huang's place. The school detained Lan and immediately reported it to the 7th District. The district sent police to the school to arrest Lan and take him to the district for interrogation by Chief Zhao. According to Lan, he was 28 years old, from Chongqing, Sichuan, and had previously worked as a primary school teacher in Sichuan. He and Huang Jing were classmates in their hometown. The couplet was sent by Qin Qinglue in Chongqing to the Merchant Marine School via the post office and forwarded to Liu Xiping for Huang Jing to collect. When Qin Qinglue entrusted me, if you came to Shanghai, please visit Huang Jing to ask if you have received the couplet. If you receive it, please write a reply. I came to Shanghai today and went to the school to visit Huang Jing. Unexpectedly, he was also arrested and transferred to the court. He said that he did not know the rest of the details. After verifying the confession, Chief Zhao sent the suspect Lan to the local court for investigation and prosecution at 2:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Woman Tan Mei's Pitiful Married Life</h3>
<p>The husband's behavior is lowly and indescribable.</p>
<p>A disagreement leads to beatings and abuse.</p>
<p>Unable to grow old together, she files for divorce.</p>
<p>Tan Mei, a young woman from Guangdong, was married to Feng Fengzhu, a fellow villager. However, due to discord between the husband and wife, she returned to her mother's home. Last winter, Feng filed a lawsuit in the local court against Tan's mother for allegedly luring her away. After the hearing, the case was dismissed. Now, Tan Mei, because she has met an unsuitable person and cannot bear to live together, has hired a lawyer to file a divorce lawsuit in the local court. Her statement said that she was married to the defendant Feng Fengzhu on August 24th of the Republic of China's 17th year through the introduction of a matchmaker, Ms. Lu. At that time, both parties belonged to old-fashioned families, so the husband's character was entirely based on the embellishments of the matchmaker's tongue. Her parents were simple and honest and believed that Feng Fengzhu was a scholarly child with good character. They were happy that their daughter had married a dragon and would not have to worry about half of her children in the future. She was a weak and inexperienced person who did not understand worldly affairs. How could she have carefully considered the etiquette? Unexpectedly, a momentary mistake led to eternal regret. After entering the door, she found that the defendant was tyrannical and his behavior was lowly and indescribable. It was difficult to harmonize the relationship between husband and wife. Sometimes, a disagreement would lead to loud scolding and abuse, and even physical abuse, with wounds and scars on her skin. Since childhood, she had been taught in the family and knew both books and etiquette. She witnessed her husband's absurd, tyrannical, and violent behavior and could not bear to live with him for a day. She had tried to commit suicide three times, but failed. Because the marriage was already a fait accompli, the family scandal would damage the family's reputation. Once exposed, it would hurt her parents' hearts. She only burned incense and prayed that he would change his mind and correct his mistakes so that they could grow old together. Therefore, she repeatedly endured, but secretly shed tears in sadness, lamenting her poor fate. Moreover, Feng Fengzhu had been married twice before, and both marriages had ended in divorce. His personality and behavior can be imagined. Recently, he has become even more outrageous and has even instigated his sixteen-year-old son from his previous marriage, Feng Shaoliang, to abuse her in every way possible, scolding and humiliating her. If she argued, her mother-in-law, Zhu, would help him to be cruel. Even her food and clothing were cut off. After she married, she bore a child in the following year and has been raising him ever since, supported by loans from her mother's family. Feng Fengzhu has never provided any assistance. On December 7th of last year, Feng Fengzhu beat her severely for a trivial matter, causing serious injuries. She returned to Ning to recuperate, and her mother-in-law took the opportunity to falsely accuse her mother of luring her away. Fortunately, the court investigated and dismissed the case. In summary of the above facts, Feng Fengzhu, as her husband, does not provide for his wife, and as a father, does not care for his son. He even colludes with his mother and son to devise poisonous schemes to harm and abuse women. There is no greater cruelty in the world than this. The relationship between husband and wife has completely broken down. She is in a thorny situation, like living in hell. The days ahead are long, and how can she constantly defend herself</p>

<h3>Jisheng Association Relief Efforts in Mianchi</h3>
<p>Mr. Feng Yangshan of the China Jisheng Association is in charge of relief efforts in Mianchi. The association has remitted 50,000 yuan in relief funds in two installments, as previously reported. However, there are at least 25,000 households of disaster victims in the county, so there are many people and few funds, making it difficult to provide assistance. Mr. Weng Yinchu and other philanthropists generously donated large sums of money, and another 5,000 yuan in relief funds were remitted yesterday to supplement the effort, but it is still difficult to manage. Director Feng had no choice but to change the relief efforts to distribute millet, which is currently inexpensive in the province, so that more people can be saved. A report received yesterday stated that he had gone to Kaifeng and then to Yancheng to purchase grain, which will be transported by train for relief.</p>
<p>French Concession Property Owners' Association</p>
<h3>Re-Requesting the Recovery of the French Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Listing Five Key Points</p>
<p>Since the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised the issue of recovering the French Municipal Council with the French Minister, although the French side has sent personnel to negotiate, there has been no clear indication to date. There are many rental disputes in the French Concession, and after the tenant loses the case, there is no appellate body to petition for redress. Therefore, the tenants in each neighborhood endure the landlords' unreasonable oppression and dare not make any noise. As the call for the recovery of the French Municipal Council grows louder, the various groups in the French Concession are sending telegrams and letters daily to alleviate their own suffering, and the situation is very tense. Yesterday, the French Property Owners' Association convened a meeting with representatives of the Cheng Zhi and Shang Yi neighborhoods and listed five key points, which were drafted into a telegram: To the Honorable Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the Honorable President Wang of the Judicial Yuan: Your departments' efforts to negotiate the recovery of the French Municipal Council have already made some progress. We are delighted that the French Municipal Council, which has long been an eyesore to the people due to its privileged status, is now scheduled for reorganization. However, the deeply ingrained habits make it difficult to rectify the situation. To truly address the root causes, a thorough reorganization is necessary. The people suffer but dare not speak out, but only those who suffer know the pain. We will elaborate on the following points: (1) Please note that Article 45 of Chapter Four of the recently promulgated Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage stipulates that exorbitant rents for the use of real estate should be prohibited by law. The soaring rents in the French Concession have reached a critical point. If the government does not take measures to restrict them, the harm to people's livelihoods will be significant. This is the first point for implementation. (2) Please note that Section 14 of Chapter Two of the aforementioned Provisional Constitution states that the people have the freedom of association and assembly. Tenants, that is, citizens, are taxpayers in the concession. Broadly speaking, this includes all sectors of agriculture, commerce, industry, and education. Our people's wisdom has not yet been fully developed, and they often act carelessly when called upon in other names. However, when it comes to rental issues, they all actively attend meetings, which shows how deeply they are affected. It is easy to guide them, and when autonomy is implemented in the concession in the future, it should start with the tenants for greater convenience. This is the second point for implementation. (3) Before the French Municipal Council is reorganized, all illegal lawsuits involving rental disputes that arise during the period of negotiation for recovery should be declared unacceptable. This is the third point to note. (4) The right of appeal should be reserved for rental lawsuits that have been illegally judged in recent times. This is the fourth point to note. (5) The unilaterally dictated printed contracts used by landlords are even more harsh and complicated than the previous rent tickets. They should be abolished immediately after the reorganization of the French Municipal Council. This is the fifth point to note. The above points are all matters of suffering with no recourse. Now that the French Municipal Council is about to be fundamentally reorganized, we are submitting them to your esteemed office in the hope that they will be adopted. The Shanghai French Concession Property Owners' Association and the Cheng Zhi Li and Shang Yi Fang Tenants' Associations respectfully submit this urgent telegram while awaiting your instructions.</p>

<h3>Butchers Demand Cancellation of Inspection Fees</h3>
<p>Dispatching representatives to petition the Finance Bureau.</p>
<p>After the resumption of the fresh meat business in this city, fresh meat was sold in the four suburban townships north of Shanghai yesterday. The Guild petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request the cancellation of the pre-slaughter, post-slaughter, and technician inspection fees. The details of yesterday's various situations are recorded below.</p>
<p>Butchers' Demands: Representatives of the Fresh Meat Industry Guild, including Rong Qianchu, Wang Jinwen, Zhu Zhigao, and Ye Hengxian, went to the Municipal Finance Bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday to petition for (1) the Slaughter Tax tickets to be resold to the butchers by the Industry Guild and (2) the establishment of a Public Welfare Fund Management Committee as soon as possible. The Second Section Chief, Wang Xiangchen, met with them and accepted the Guild's request to report to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<p>Cancellation of Slaughter Fees: The Fresh Meat Industry Guild sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "We hereby inform you that although the disputes over slaughter taxes have been resolved through the mediation of your esteemed association, and it has been stipulated that the actual price of the tax ticket is 30 cents, with the remaining 9 cents to be designated for use by order of the supervisors, our fellow members are still uncertain due to the lack of a clear announcement. Furthermore, the pre-slaughter fees paid by fellow members in the concessions and the post-slaughter fees paid by fellow members in the inland areas are unexpected sources of pain for our members. In addition, the technician fees in the four suburban townships are an unreasonable tax borne by all members in those townships, which has long been opposed by all members in the city. In terms of principle, since our members have already paid taxes, they have complied with the principle of 'one tax per item,' and the pre-slaughter and post-slaughter fees are additional unreasonable levies. Moreover, the technician fees in the four suburban townships are particularly unfair in terms of law. In order to protect the livelihood of our members and quell disputes among them, our Guild must ask your esteemed association to show concern for the difficulties of the industry and, based on the circumstances, request the Municipal Government to cancel the pre-slaughter, post-slaughter, and technician fees in the four suburban townships immediately in order to demonstrate fairness and show compassion."</p>
<p>Guild Damaged: The Fresh Meat Industry Guild at No. 4 Anxiang Lane, Datong Road, Zhabei, was damaged the night before by members Cao and Wang. The reason was that Cao was a small slaughter tax contractor who contracted a section from a large dealer for a daily tax of 32.5 yuan, averaging about 12 pigs slaughtered per day. Now that the tax is collected per pig, he will inevitably be unprofitable. Therefore, he misunderstood the Guild. It is reported that the Guild has filed a request with the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Public Welfare Undertakings: The fresh meat dealers in Shanghai's north and south, as well as the four suburban townships, have been demanding that the Municipal Government disclose the status of the public welfare funds, which have been approved to be allocated from the slaughter tax, because the management committee has not yet been established and the purpose is unclear. Yesterday, they went to the Guild to demand that Rong Qianchu, a standing committee member, explain that the public welfare funds are used for materials for mortuaries, butcher and slaughter worker's children's free schools and the establishment of a mortuary in each Shanghai north, south, bao, and suburban township, and the course of petitioning to the Financial Bureau was reported. The members then dispersed.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Foreign Rice Must Be Registered First</h3>
<p>Starting from the 27th of this month.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Guild issued an urgent notice yesterday, stating, "We hereby inform you that we have received an instruction from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that in order to understand the actual food situation of the citizens of this city, all purchases of foreign rice, whether spot or future, must be registered and not concealed. We have already notified the fellow members to comply with this instruction. However, there is a rumor among the fellow members that registration requires the payment of a grain storage fund, which is a misunderstanding. Our Guild has recommended four committee members, Zhu, Yan, Qiang, and Cai, to present the matter to the authorities. They were instructed to comply with the registration order and that there is no need to pay any fees, so there should be no suspicion. Therefore, a meeting was convened yesterday, and it was decided that all fellow members who have ordered foreign rice from foreign firms must bring the order form to the Guild on Minguo Road to register. The Guild will stamp the back of the order form to prove it and issue a registration application form, which the fellow member must fill out in detail and submit to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for registration together with the order form. Resale and repurchase do not require registration. After the goods arrive, the original buyer must bring the delivery order to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to register and stamp it for cancellation. Those who have already applied for registration with the Bureau of Social Affairs must still register with our Guild to facilitate statistics. The above measures will be implemented from the 27th of this month. All fellow members are hereby notified to comply with these measures and not to conceal anything, lest they bring blame upon themselves."</p>
<h3>Lowering the Standard Cotton Qualification</h3>
<p>The Yarn and Cotton Industry Raises Objections</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Yarn and Cotton Industry Guild yesterday, stating that the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange suddenly lowered the standard cotton qualification, which is inconsistent with precedent, and requested that negotiations be conducted to change it. The Chamber of Commerce forwarded a letter to the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, stating, "We hereby inform you that we have received a letter from the Shanghai Yarn and Cotton Merchants Guild, stating that the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange suddenly changed the standard cotton qualification. Outsiders cannot know what the intention is. According to past practice, the amount of standard cotton that has been auctioned and traded in October is not small. Suddenly lowering the qualification by 67 qian seems inappropriate according to past practice. Moreover, it is even more unfair that the Han cotton is lowered while the Tong cotton remains the same. If the Exchange cannot withdraw the finalized agreement because the matter has already been settled, then the original 1.6 liang added to the Tong cotton should be raised by 4 qian and restored to the original 1.6 liang so that neither side suffers any losses and fairness is shown. Moreover, although the production volume of Tong cotton is small, its special quality ranks among the best in the world's cotton industry. For the sake of the future of domestic products, its superior position should be maintained. Our fellow members, due to their interests, believe that this move is inappropriate and have already sent a letter to negotiate. For the sake of record, we hereby inform you that your Exchange should uphold justice and forward a letter to the Exchange to quickly correct the situation in order to comply with precedent." In view of this, it seems reasonable to say that the qualification of the standard cotton has been suddenly lowered and that the goods that have already been auctioned and traded are inconsistent with precedent. What is the actual situation? We should inform you of the situation so that your institute can handle it fairly and reply immediately so that we can inform the Guild.</p>
<h3>Yarn Association Investigates Yarn Mills Nationwide</h3>
<p>The local Chinese Yarn Mills Association compiles and prints a directory of Chinese yarn mills nationwide every year, detailing the names, addresses, wholesale addresses, start dates, capital amounts, public debt funds, staff (board of directors, business department, technical department), spindles, thread spindles, looms, power, workers, cotton used, yarn production, cloth production, and yarn and cloth trademarks of Chinese, British, and Japanese yarn mills nationwide. The latest tenth survey has been completed and published. Each directory sells for only 2 jiao.</p>

Resolved: To forward the request as is.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<h3>Notice Not to Purchase the Sanxin Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>The company has a huge stake in the factory.</p>
<p>Since the sale of the Sanxin Yarn Factory in this city, it has attracted the attention of all sectors. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially entrusted its legal advisors, lawyers Huang Naimu and Zhu Shaowen, to publish a notice in the newspaper, warning buyers not to purchase the factory. The notice is recorded below: "The Sanxin Yarn Factory is the former Huasheng Weaving Bureau. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a huge shareholder and holds a majority of shares. The details have been published in the newspaper by the General Administration of China Merchants and our lawyers. We now understand that the factory is being privately sold by Sheng Ze Cheng and others. In addition to resorting to law and awaiting the court's judgment, we will not recognize any actions by any person of any nationality, acting directly or under the cover of a nominee, that seek to infringe on the legal rights of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This notice is hereby issued for the information of the public."</p>
<h3>Urging the Collection of Inland River Launch Operation Permits</h3>
<p>If resistance is prolonged, operation will be ordered to cease</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau yesterday issued an instruction to the various launch bureaus in the county's inland rivers, stating, "We received a telegram from the Jiangsu Construction Department stating that the department had stipulated regulations for the issuance of inland river vessel operation permits, requiring all vessels to comply within three months of the implementation of these regulations. It also issued a winter telegram to the bureau last month, strictly ordering it to immediately submit the applications. Most of the vessel bureaus and companies in various counties have successively submitted their applications. However, some have not yet submitted or replied to the corrections after being instructed due to incomplete procedures, and some have not yet submitted their applications. The reason for the delay is either an excuse that the procedures have not been prepared in time or that the staff in charge have made excuses for delays. We should impose penalties and suspend operations separately in accordance with the regulations. However, considering that it is not easy for the various shipping companies to establish vessel operations, we are reluctant to impose severe penalties if they abandon them. Therefore, we are ordering the director to take responsibility for supervising and urging them to comply without further delay. In addition to issuing separate telegrams, we are limiting the period to three days after the arrival of the document to submit a report on all vessels within the county that should have obtained an operation permit. If any vessel is found to be operating without a permit, it will be immediately suspended and the director will be held accountable for connivance. All returned documents due to incomplete procedures should be investigated and reported for verification without delay." We have forwarded the Jiangsu Province's regulations for the issuance of inland river vessel operation permits to the various vessel bureaus for compliance and have urged the vessel bureaus to submit their applications on the 20th of last month. Now, most of the vessel bureaus have submitted their applications within the deadline, but some have not submitted their applications. Such deliberate delays are very inappropriate. In accordance with the telegram, we hereby order the vessel bureaus to submit their applications for the operation permits for the various vessels that should have been obtained within three days after the arrival of the document in compliance with the previous order. After the promulgation of this order, if there is any further violation, we will immediately suspend operations in accordance with the regulations. Comply with this order.</p>
