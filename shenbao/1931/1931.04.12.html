<p>時評</p>
<h3>西葡兩國之時局</h3>
<p>葡萄牙原由西班牙分裂而出。其初原屬一國。其民族同。其國人之性情亦相同也。今茲國内之紛擾亦同時而起。按西班牙人民之反對專制與君主。已非一日。去年曾有大罷工之舉。並有軍人叛變之舉。卒以勢力散漫。未能成功。近頃以來。政府改組。稍稍改變其專斷之態度。而國人亦稍安靖不謂今日正當葡國軍隊叛變情勢嚴重之時旣有失業工人之示威又有反政府領袖潛行回國陰謀起事之謠於是一夕數驚。人心驚惶之寗。是暫安之局勢又將因此而變動矣</p>
<p>至於葡萄牙軍隊之叛變。其始僅屬於阿索爾斯羣島一隅。今則漸行躉衍。政府派遣之防軍。亦有傾向叛軍之消息。並聞葡京今晚亦有巷戰之說。是其情勢嚴重。更非西班牙可比。由此以觀。凡一民族而一旦有感而動。雖已分裂之國。亦有影響。可知同一民族之關係大也。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Those coming from Jiangxi said that this time twelve divisions are encircling the Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi. The arrangement is different from general strategy. Usually, when troops march to the enemy front, they must distinguish between outposts, vanguards, and main forces. Because the Communist bandits are a disorganized rabble scattered in various villages, if they march in battle formation, advancing in column sequence, there is bound to be a risk of the enemy cutting off communication. This time a new method is used that will inevitably cause those who are attached to the bandits to retreat to the bandit area. Those who have been coerced will be given the opportunity to escape from the bandit team at any time when the troops pass through the area. The method of combining each division with the local defense corps is also very novel. When the troops pass through the area, half of the defense corps accompanies the army forward, and the other half stays to guard the local area. The accompanying defense corps takes on the labor of supplying and transporting provisions, so each army does not directly levy from the people. Now the Communist bandits have retreated to occupy four counties, including Ningdu and Guangchang. There are twelve divisions of troops surrounding them. It is said that a general offensive will be implemented around the 15th. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Situation in Spain and Portugal</h3>
<p>Portugal originally split from Spain. In the beginning, they belonged to the same country. Their ethnicities are the same. The temperaments of their citizens are also the same. Now, domestic turmoil is rising at the same time. According to the Spanish people, their opposition to autocracy and the monarch is not a matter of a day or two. Last year, there was a major strike. There were also military rebellions. Ultimately, they failed due to dispersed forces. Since recently, the government has reorganized and slightly changed its autocratic attitude. The people have also been slightly安靖. It is not said that today, just as the situation of the Portuguese military rebellion is serious, there are demonstrations by unemployed workers, and rumors of anti-government leaders sneaking back into the country to plot an incident. One is frightened several times in an evening. The minds of the people are in a state of chaos. This temporary stability is about to change again because of this.</p>
<p>As for the rebellion of the Portuguese military, it initially only belonged to one corner of the Azores Islands. Now it is gradually spreading. There are also reports that the defense forces sent by the government are also leaning towards the rebel army. It is also heard that there may be street fighting in Lisbon tonight. Its situation is serious, even more so than Spain. From this perspective, whenever a nation is touched and moves, even a divided country will be affected. It can be seen that the relationship between the same ethnic group is great.</p>

<h3>Portuguese Unrest Seriously Dealt With</h3>
<p>National Army Wavering</p>
<p>Government Precariously Perched</p>
<p>But Authorities Claim Sufficient Control</p>
<p>Madrid, 10th (National Telegram) According to news coming from the Portuguese border, street fighting has broken out in Lisbon tonight, but this has not been confirmed. It is also said that the attitude of the troops in several provinces towards the government is wavering, and there is a tendency to revolt and march towards the capital, so the government's situation is extremely precarious. The above report cannot determine its authenticity due to strict censorship.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (National Telegram) The Portuguese government is deliberating in fortresses day and night, and martial law has been declared in Lisbon and Oporto. A plot to overthrow Diktator was discovered in Oporto some days ago, and 30 people were arrested beforehand, including several former cabinet members, so all troops are now concentrated there. Many people in Lisbon have moved elsewhere to avoid the scourge of war. Newspaper censorship is extremely strict, and liberal newspapers such as the Republican newspaper have been banned. All public buildings and key entrances and exits are equipped with machine guns, and armored vehicles patrol the streets from time to time. Cars must be inspected when passing through. As for the situation in Madeira and the Azores, it is very unclear here because direct communication has been cut off for a long time, but it is known that the current upheaval was launched in Paris because former President Machado is directing remotely from there.</p>
<p>Madrid, 1st (National Telegram) News from Portugal is still contradictory. The government's external statement claims that the situation is easy to control and that order is calm except for the islands of Madeira and the Azores. However, merchants from Portugal bring alarming news. Part of the air force near Lisbon has also mutinied, but it seems to have failed. Therefore, Air Force Commander Colonel Bei, Deputy Adjutant General Sa Mengtai, and many squadron officers have flown to Spanish territory. Now, large teams of soldiers and police patrol Lisbon and major cities day and night. A telegram from Portuguese Southwest Africa says that political fugitives in Angola have mobilized the local garrison to revolt. The rebels in Madeira and the Azores have also reportedly telegraphed the League of Nations to notify them of the establishment of a temporary government, declaring that the Portuguese capital has been temporarily moved to Funchal. The commander-in-chief of the Portuguese army is now ordering the dissolution of the rebellious troops in Lisbon.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Reuters) The cabinet has approved the suspension of the order guaranteeing individual protection on the islands of Sao Miguel and Terceira in the Azores. The cabinet also decided to dismiss the defense forces in Funchal and other places, and also agreed to apply the recent order to strip civil and military officials of their positions for supporting disobedience, rebellion, or inciting others to do so to the entire territory of Portugal, and decided to immediately implement the disciplinary measures stipulated in the order against General Sousa Dias and other officials.</p>
<h3>Spanish People Panicked and Uneasy</h3>
<p>Anti-Government Leader Franco</p>
<p>Rumors of a Conspiracy to Return and Revolt</p>
<p>Madrid, 11th (National Telegram) Barcelona, Spain has also been alarmed several times in one night recently. Rumors are rife, and there is a great potential for an incident to occur at any moment. However, no one can say clearly which party is launching it. The garrison is now making emergency preparations and placing machine guns in various key points. It is widely rumored that Major Franco has sneaked back here to plot a major revolt. Although inquiries from various parties have failed to confirm this, the panic and uneasiness of the people throughout the country can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Madrid, 10th (Reuters) Today in the Spanish capital, unemployed people gathered outside the headquarters of the National Party to protest. Gunshots rang out suddenly, seriously injuring one or two people. The police later restored order.</p>
<p>Madrid, 10th (National Telegram) Striking workers recently engaged in a melee with members of the newly organized "Bat-Wielding Party," killing one person and injuring several others. The entire city is now on high alert, and people are panicked, fearing that a minor conflict will lead to a major upheaval. In addition, the outcome of the municipal and provincial elections has not yet been determined, and both parties have a strong tendency to create trouble.</p>
<h3>Wakatsuki Accepts the Post of President of the Minseito Party</h3>
<p>Hamaguchi Cabinet Decides to Resign En Masse</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Nichi-Rengo) Reijiro Wakatsuki has formally accepted the post of president of the Minseito Party.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Dentsu) Because the successor to the presidency has been formally decided to be Wakatsuki, Prime Minister Hamaguchi will invite the two executives of the party, Raimu and Sakurauchi, to the hospital at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th to formally resign as president.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Nichi-Rengo) Wakatsuki visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi at the Imperial University Hospital this morning. The Prime Minister advised Wakatsuki to take the post of successor to the presidency for the sake of the country and the future of the party, overcoming all difficulties. After Wakatsuki left the hospital, he met with Matsumoto and Machida, who also advised him to take the post of president. At 1:20 p.m., Wakatsuki met with Yamamoto, who also strongly recommended Wakatsuki as the successor to the presidency. The situation gradually moved Wakatsuki's heart, and he finally made up his mind to brave all difficulties and take on the arduous task, feeling that he could not but accept the post of successor to the presidency.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Nichi-Rengo) Wakatsuki has agreed to serve as the successor to the presidency of the Minseito Party. The government plans to hold its final cabinet meeting on the 12th to decide to resign en masse. Bihara will meet the Emperor to present the resignation letter. The Grand Edict will likely be issued around the 15th, and the party will hold a joint meeting of members of both houses and councilors on the same day to formally elect Wakatsuki as the successor to the presidency of the Minseito Party.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Dentsu) Wakatsuki had hesitated to accept the post because he saw that there was a faction in the party supporting Interior Minister Adachi opposing his ascent. Later, Sakurauchi, the secretary-general of the Minseito Party, was deeply concerned that Wakatsuki's refusal to take the post would render all plans a pipe dream, that disputes would occur within the party, and especially that the political power would be gained by others, so he visited Interior Minister Adachi this morning, saying that the actions of the young faction at this time would cause fatal injury to the cabinet, and for the sake of the government's and the party's safety, all party members should unanimously elect Wakatsuki and ask Adachi to appease the young faction. Adachi expressed understanding of this and devoted himself to appeasing the young faction, and by the afternoon, the opposition had largely ceased. Interior Minister Adachi immediately notified the party executives of this matter, and at 4:00 p.m., Wakatsuki finally indicated that he would take office.</p>

<h3>Zeppelin Airship Arrives in Cairo</h3>
<p>Crowds Gather in Huge Numbers</p>
<p>Cairo, 10th (Reuters) The German airship Graf Zeppelin, carrying 25 passengers, flew out of Friedrichshafen at 4:00 a.m. yesterday and flew over Alexandria at 1:15 p.m. today. Crowds flocked to the streets and rooftops, cheering and welcoming it. The airship circled the city several times for 15 minutes before flying towards Cairo. It arrived in Cairo at 4:20 p.m., 13 hours ahead of schedule. The airship radioed to ask if it could land, but received a reply that the preparations were not yet complete, so it went to Upper Egypt and will return here tomorrow morning. There are several British people on board, such as British airship R100 commander Mr. Booth and Berlin British Embassy aviation attache Mr. Gosage, all of whom are among the passengers. The airship's piloting is personally directed by Commander Dr. Eckener.</p>
<p>Cairo, 11th (Reuters) The Graf Zeppelin airship arrived here at 5:30 a.m. today. The people gathered in the airfield, looking up and cheering. One of the airship's staff first landed by parachute. The airship then unloaded the mooring cables, which were held by 350 British air force personnel, keeping the airship in place for an hour. At the time, the crowds were huge, and the fire brigade used hoses to spray water, and the crowds began to retreat. The airship will fly to Palestine today and will pass here again on its return to Germany in the evening.</p>
<p>Jerusalem, 11th (Reuters) The Graf Zeppelin airship flew over the sky here at 11:00 a.m. this morning, soaring for 15 minutes. The viewers along the way were packed with people, and when it flew overhead, they cheered incessantly.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>139th Session of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan held its 139th session at 8:00 a.m. on the 11th, with 32 committee members including Luo Ding in attendance. The chairman was Shao Yuanchong. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) Review of the draft Garrison Act and organizational system chart, which was resolved to be submitted to the Legal and Military Affairs Committees for review. (2) Report by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Yuan, together with the Economic Committee, on the review of the draft Forestry Law, which was resolved to be submitted again to the five committee members Zhuang Songfu, Luo Ding, Shi Shangkuan, Huang Youchang, and Sun Jingya for review. (3) Report by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Yuan, together with the Economic Committee, on the interpretation of the ambiguity in Article 16 of the Farmers' Association Law and the issue of how to provide assistance to those who cannot write ballots in the election of Farmers' Association officials, which was resolved to be passed in accordance with the review report. (The Farmers' Association Law does not have provisions restricting members of chambers of commerce or educational associations from being members of Farmers' Associations, nor does it restrict civil servants from joining the association. Therefore, those who have the qualifications stipulated in Article 16 of the Farmers' Association Law are naturally eligible to be members of Farmers' Associations, and there is no doubt about it. As for the third point of interpretation requested, it is related to the People's Organization Election Rules passed by the Central Executive Committee and should be submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Central Executive Committee for interpretation.)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Speech at the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Hoping that Party and Government Unite Efforts to Carry Out Land Surveying Chairman Chiang arrived in Hangzhou at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 10th). At 11:00 a.m. today (the 11th), he convened both party and government officials to give instructions at the Provincial Party Headquarters. Prior to this, the Provincial Party Headquarters prepared temporary entry and exit passes and distributed them to various party and government agencies. Around 11:00 a.m., people from all sectors of the party and government came one after another, and the auditorium was crowded. At 11:30 a.m., Chairman Chiang arrived dressed in a gray Zhongshan suit, and everyone rose to pay their respects and applauded to welcome him. After performing the customary salute, Chairman Chiang gave a speech, roughly saying that since overthrowing feudal forces and warlords last year, the foundation of the party and revolution has gradually become stable, but how to maintain past achievements in the future is everyone's responsibility. However, in the brother's opinion, before the reactionary forces were eliminated, everyone went all out and moved forward bravely. After the reactionary forces were eliminated, the unity gradually dissipated, and the work gradually slackened. This situation is very dangerous. It is hoped that party comrades and government colleagues will work together with one heart and one mind, continue the previous spirit, and step up their work, and the future achievements will definitely be better than other provinces. Secondly, Zhejiang's finances have been extremely difficult recently. China has always solved financial problems with nothing more than the four words "increase revenue and reduce expenditure." If Zhejiang's finances are reorganized, there will definitely be a solution. The past achievements of the provincial government cannot be said to be bad. It is only that too many things have been done, and the economic strength is weak, which is not enough for distribution, resulting in few visible results. It is hoped that in the future, economic resources, time, and talent will be concentrated on doing one or two things, and the results will be significant. The most important thing for Zhejiang is to carry out land surveying and investigate the population. According to the investigation, the young comrades in the party headquarters of various counties are not working hard, but they mostly do things that should not be done instead of doing things that should be done, such as monopolizing litigation and interfering in politics. If the government decides on a policy, a comprehensive plan, a predetermined budget and time limit, and goes to carry out land surveying, and the comrades of the party headquarters help, it will definitely be possible to increase tax revenue by two or three times in the shortest possible time. If there is a solution to the economy, then everything will be solved easily, and political progress will be rapid. It is hoped that the party and government will cooperate and advocate for the whole country. Furthermore, the National Conference will be opened soon. The focus of this conference is on the provisional constitution and the abolition of unequal treaties. It is hoped that Zhejiang Province will draft proposals on these two points and make contributions. The speech ended at 12:30 p.m., and a group photo was taken in the garden to commemorate the event.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Goes to Ji'an for Inspection</h3>
<p>Giving Instructions to Wang Jinyu and Luo Fan in Person</p>
<p>Talking About the Bandit Suppression Situation on the Front Lines After Returning to the Province</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Director He, in order to inspect the situation on the front lines because the bandit suppression armies on all sides have made progress recently, took a plane to Ji'an with Chief of Staff Zhou Weigang at 8:30 a.m. on the 9th. At about 10:00 a.m., they arrived in Ji'an safely. Governor Wang, Division Commander Luo, and other important figures in Ji'an all came to the airfield to greet them. After He got off the plane, he went to the Governor's Office to rest. Wang and Luo reported on the military situation on the front lines in detail. He greatly praised Division Commander Luo's recapture of Futian and the progress of Wang's troops and gave instructions on all matters in person. At 4:00 p.m., He returned to the province by the same plane, arriving safely at the Nanchang station at about 6:00 p.m. After returning to the headquarters, he talked to the press in detail about the situation on the front lines and the progress made. The main points are summarized as follows. Reporter (Q): Director, you personally took a plane to Ji'an. What was the situation? He (A): I departed from Nanchang Airport at 8:30 a.m. this morning and arrived in Ji'an at 10:20 a.m. I immediately met with Governor Wang and Division Commander Luo. According to the discussion and investigation of various situations, the requirements in the plan are very satisfactory. All officials have embraced the central government's intentions and are working hard to suppress the bandits, and the soldiers are also working very hard. The Red bandits in the Futian and Baisha areas have been defeated by Wang's (Jinyu) troops. Progress is being made every day. Although the main force of the bandits has not yet been completely eliminated, with the extremely high morale, I think the goal of fundamental eradication will be achieved in the near future. (Q): The Yongxin area on the west bank of the Gan River has always been a lair for the Communist bandits. What is the situation recently? (A): Since Li's bandit Mingrui's force sneaked over, there was an attempt to disturb Ji'an. Recently, Luo's division surrounded and wiped them out near Yongyang, killing more than a thousand people and seizing hundreds of bandit guns. The strength of the bandits has been almost completely lost, and it is definitely not enough to cause trouble. In recent days, various departments have continued to clear and suppress the scattered bandits, and they will be completely eliminated soon. Therefore, the Ji'an city has been improving, and the people are very stable. (Q): According to what you said, Director, the Red bandits in central Jiangxi are not enough to quell them. Can you guarantee that the remaining bandits will not flee elsewhere? (A): This cannot guarantee that no one will slip through the net, but I have discussed it with the commanders of various routes in recent days, and there are specific interception methods, which should prevent future troubles forever.

<h3>After the Resolution of the Ni Zhaomei Case in Hankou</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Will Communicate the Negotiation Process to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, the case of the Japanese sailor shooting and killing Chinese farmer Ni Zhaomei has been negotiated by the municipal government together with Zhou Zechun, the inspector commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Japanese consul in Hankou. The Japanese consul apologized and compensated 800 yuan for the funeral. On the 9th, the municipal government specifically communicated the handling of this case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying, "On the 2nd of this month, the newspapers in this city reported that a Japanese sailor was shooting at a target in the Japanese garden near the 13th Precinct of the Police Department, injuring a Chinese. Because this matter involved human life, this office ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and report in detail. Subsequently, the Social Affairs Bureau reported that Ni Zhaomei, a member of the First District Farmers' Association, was injured by Japanese shooting at a target, and personnel had been sent to the scene of the incident to investigate, requesting serious negotiations. Immediately, instructions were issued to report the investigation situation as soon as possible, and the Public Security Bureau was ordered to investigate and report quickly, and a letter was sent to the Japanese Consul General's Office in Hankou requesting verification and reply. Later, the Public Security Bureau reported that the Japanese navy shot and injured farmer Ni Zhaomei with a bullet. The Japanese navy translator signed and admitted it. The injured person has been sent to the Tongrenhui Hospital for treatment, with a business card and diagnosis certificate attached, requesting verification. The Social Affairs Bureau also submitted the same situation, and shortly thereafter, the two bureaus reported that farmer Ni Zhaomei had died after ineffective treatment. A letter was sent to the Hankou District Court requesting personnel to inspect and verify, praying for serious negotiations as soon as possible in order to emphasize national rights and comfort the spirit. While asking Commissioner Zhou about the negotiation situation in person, a letter was received from the Japanese Consulate stating that it expressed extreme condolences for Ni Zhaomei's death and would provide considerable compensation. Immediately, Commissioner Zhou was invited to go to the Japanese Consulate to request an apology to Chinese officials, generous compensation to the deceased's family, and severe punishment for the perpetrator, and that shooting targets should not be arbitrarily set up in the future to avoid incidents. Now, Commissioner Zhou has personally informed that the Japanese consul has agreed to punish the navy and provide compensation of 800 yuan, which he brought to this office along with the funds. The department has been ordered to count and collect the funds. Commissioner Zhou has sent a telegram to the Ministry and the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and separate letters to the Hankou District Court Procuratorate. We are now sending the original reports of the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus, and the original letter from the Japanese Consulate together for your review and reply."</p>
<h3>The Complete Picture of the Haiyuan Pavilion Collection</h3>
<p>Many Yuan Dynasty Imprints Discovered Again in Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The collection of books from the Yang family's Haiyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng, Jinan, has been scattered and dispersed due to banditry, attracting great attention from all quarters. Book dealers from Peiping and Tianjin have flocked to Jinan to search and collect them, and they have bought no less than several dozen types. Recently, many Song and Yuan dynasty imprints have been discovered, and five types have been purchased by Peiping booksellers. Among them are "Collected Works of Lü Hengzhou," a two-volume set, and "Collected Works of Liu Bin Ke," both meticulously collated Song dynasty editions by Huang Yaopu. The remaining three types are Yuan dynasty imprints. They were sold for 2,000 yuan, having been transferred to Jinan through bandits' hands and not yet sold by the Yang family. Upon receiving this information, the Shandong Department of Education is investigating undiscovered Yuan dynasty imprints on the one hand and preparing funds on the other, instructing the Shandong Provincial Library to purchase them widely to prevent them from flowing to other locations and being resold overseas. Furthermore, the Provincial Library has newly acquired a Ming dynasty manuscript, "Comprehensive Spiritual Scripture of the Great Unification," a single volume, priced at 70 yuan. This scripture is a unique copy in the country, formerly collected by Jiang Zheng Hall and later by Shi Yanzhai. Also, regarding the aforementioned "Collected Works of Lü Hengzhou," "Collected Works of Liu Zi Xin," and "Collected Works of Lin Hejing," the Provincial Library offered 250 yuan last year, but the bookseller refused to sell. Subsequently, they were taken to Peiping. One volume of "Collected Works of Liu Zi Xin" was purchased by the former Minister of Education of Beijing, Fu Zengxiang, for 1,000 yuan. "Collected Works of Lin Hejing" was purchased by Mayor Hu Ruoyu in Qingdao. Now, "Collected Works of Lü Hengzhou" has been obtained by Peiping booksellers, which will surely bring a substantial profit in the future. According to one bookseller, in Peiping, the Tsinghua, Peiping, and Beihai libraries, as well as Fu Zengxiang and Tao Lanquan, are sparing no expense to purchase the Haiyuan Pavilion collection. Therefore, the Yang family's collection is highly sought after, and the prices are extraordinarily high. According to records, the Haiyuan Pavilion collection includes "Correct and Supplementary Records of Couplet Writings in the Corner of the Bookshelf of the Yang Family," listing 269 types, and the book catalog engraved by Jiang Jianxia, listing 360 types. The Shandong Library Director, Wang Xiantang, went to Liaocheng years ago to consult old county records and learned that Yang Feng'a (grandson of Yang Zhitang) had personally compiled a complete catalog in his later years, totaling 464 books. Later, Wang also purchased four volumes of the clean manuscript draft of the catalog, with Yang Feng'a's inscription, totaling 469 types, which is three more than those recorded in the Liaocheng archives. Wang is now finishing the clean manuscript draft, renaming it "Catalog of Song and Yuan Rare Books of the Haiyuan Pavilion," which is about to be printed. It is said that Wang will go to Yexian tomorrow (the 10th) to investigate the burning of the Hainan Temple Tripitaka. After that, he will return to Jinan and then go to Tianjin to discuss the Haiyuan Pavilion collection issue with Yang Jingfu. Now, the preface to Wang's "Catalog of Song and Yuan Rare Books of the Haiyuan Pavilion" is transcribed below to provide a complete picture of the collection.</p>
<p>(The "Catalog of Song and Yuan Books of the Yang Family's Haiyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng" lists 269 types in "Correct and Supplementary Records of Couplet Writings in the Corner of the Bookshelf," and Jiang Jianxia's engraved catalog lists 360 types, neither of which provides a complete picture of the Yang family's fine books. Years ago, I went to Liaocheng to consult the old county records and learned that Mr. Yang Feng'a had personally compiled a complete catalog in his later years, totaling 464 books and 11,328 volumes, which was submitted by the county government and forwarded to the Shandong Director of Studies for registration and endorsement. His family said that it had been taken to Tianjin. Now, I have acquired four volumes of the clean manuscript draft after much effort, with Mr. Feng'a's inscription, totaling 455 types. After compiling, one type was added, and thirteen more types were inserted with clipped notes, resulting in a total of 469 types, which is three more than those recorded in the Liaocheng archives. This is likely because Mr. Feng'a slightly reduced or omitted some items from the hand-compiled draft during registration. In any case, the fine books of the Haiyuan Pavilion are all included here. The first volume of the original book has two seals, "Haiyuan Pavilion" and "Collection of Yang Baoyi." The last volume has Bao Yi's private seal and the seal of "Tao Nan Commoner" below Yang's postscript. The title "Haiyuan Pavilion Book Catalog" is marked on the first line of each volume, and the second line also notes that the character "He" was avoided due to the family taboo by omitting a stroke when transcribing. Now, following the title slip on the front page, it is uniformly changed to "Catalog of Song and Yuan Rare Books of the Haiyuan Pavilion" to ensure uniformity. Any discrepancies in volume numbers, differences in book titles, or variations in the number of volumes and any doubts about the identified editions found in "Correct and Supplementary Records of Couplet Writings in the Corner of the Bookshelf" and Jiang's engraved "Catalog of the Haiyuan Pavilion Collection" are also noted below for reference.)</p>
<h3>Settlement of the Case of a Japanese National Crushing a Chinese Woman to Death in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Japanese nationals residing in Qingdao, relying on consular jurisdiction as a protective talisman, have repeatedly caused deaths. In the case of rickshaw puller Ma Hongcheng being kicked to death by a Japanese national some years ago, the case was transferred to the central government for negotiation, but it remains unresolved to this day. Last year, a Japanese national, Seo Senichi, drove recklessly on a thoroughfare without sounding the horn, crushing a Chinese woman, Qin Zhang, to death on the spot. After this case occurred, the Qingdao City Party Department and the Jinan Municipal Government both sent letters to the Qingdao Municipal Government for serious negotiations. Qin Zhang's son, Qin Wenyuan, also repeatedly requested the Municipal Government to redress his mother's grievance, maintain humanity, and uphold national rights. The Municipal Government, based on reports and the victim's family's demands, has repeatedly engaged in serious negotiations with the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao, Kawagoe Shigeru. After several months, the Japanese Consulate finally replied, agreeing to resolve the case, with the following conditions: (1) Sending a compensation fee of 1,000 yuan; (2) Punishing Seo; (3) The Japanese Consulate sending a letter of apology to the Municipal Government. This death case has now been completely resolved. (April 8th)</p>
<h3>Ma Hongkui Takes in Northwest Disaster Orphans</h3>
<p>Establishing Disaster Orphan Schools in Tai'an</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: In recent years, the natural disasters in the northwestern provinces have been extremely dire. Not only have tree bark and grass roots been eaten clean, but also cases of exchanging children for food and boiling bones for cooking have been frequently seen. In particular, the orphans in the disaster areas have suffered widespread deaths and injuries, which is especially tragic. Various charitable organizations have tried to provide relief. For example, the Northwest Disaster Relief Committee has taken in over 200 people, and the Xiangshan Orphanage, run by Xiong Xiling, has taken in over 400 people, totaling over 600 people. These disaster orphans, having escaped death and entered life, were celebrating their recovery, but soon, due to economic difficulties, they could not maintain their livelihood. The lives of these 600-plus disaster orphans were about to fall into despair again. Later, the 15th Route Commander Ma Hongkui specially sent someone to negotiate, transported them all to Tai'an, and prepared to establish Northwest Disaster Orphan Schools, instructing the department advisor Qu Shen to actively manage them. The curriculum focuses on agriculture, commerce, industry, and vocational training. Various textile machines are being purchased one after another. It is said that the monthly expenses are about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, all donated by Ma. The school has already started classes, and a formal opening ceremony was held on the 5th of this month. Those present at the ceremony included various schools in Tai'an, officers of the 15th Route, and male and female guests, totaling 5,000 to 6,000 people. The meeting proceeded as scheduled. Deputy Headmaster Qu Shen reported on the preparations, followed by Headmaster Ma Hongkui's speech, which mainly described the pain of the disaster orphans and encouraged them to accelerate vocational education and revitalize the Northwest industry. Next, Chief of Staff Luo Zhen, Special Envoy Tong Yaohua of the 35th Division, Zhao Zinan representing the Suiyuan Relief Committee, and Shang Zezhi representing the Tai'an County Party Department all gave extremely poignant speeches. Finally, the disaster orphan representative, Liu Shun, delivered a thank-you speech and a detailed report on the situation in the disaster area, which brought tears to the eyes of everyone present. In the afternoon, new dramas and various recreational performances were staged, which were highly praised by the audience. (April 9th)</p>
<h3>Li Yangjing Inspects the Guangdong-Jiangxi Border Defense</h3>
<p>Arranging Matters for Searching and Suppressing Remnant Bandits in Shaozhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the 19th Route Army entered Jiangxi to suppress the communist bandits, the Guangdong authorities, fearing that the Jiangxi bandits would scatter and flee to the adjacent Guangdong-Jiangxi border, have been drawing troops from the 63rd Division's Li Yangjing unit stationed in Guilin, sending Huang Yanzhen's and Huang Zhiwen's detachments to deploy defenses in the Beijiang Nanxiong area. Recently, after the Jiangxi bandits retreated from Yudu, the 19th Route Army was stationed to block Jiangnan. Thus, the defense of eastern Jiangxi has temporarily eased. However, the south of Jiangxi and the north of Guangdong, which are connected to the border of Hunan, and the Li Mingrui gang, which suffered losses in Chongyi, are still scattered and hidden in eastern Hunan. In addition to the Jiangnan government troops having considerable defenses, the Guangdong side also attaches great importance to the defense of Beijiang. Li Yangjing, the commander of the 63rd Division, to inspect the Beijiang defense and plan for pacification, specially departed from the province for the front line on the 4th of this month to preside over everything. At about 9 a.m. that morning, Li, accompanied by the regiment commander Yan Yingyu of the supplementary regiment and his bodyguards, boarded the Yue Shao train at the Xicun Station and headed for Shaozhou. Upon arriving in Yingde, he first inspected the 126th Brigade stationed in Yingde and toured the defenses in the Yingqing area. After finishing, he took the original train to Shaozhou. At 6 p.m. that afternoon, Li finally arrived in Shaoguan. Military officers, brigade commanders, and regimental commanders stationed in Shaozhou all came to the station to welcome him. After arriving in Shaozhou, Li stayed at the 63rd Division headquarters in the old Governor's Office in Shaozhou. The next day, he convened the brigade commanders and regimental commanders of his unit in Shaozhou to hold a pacification conference at the headquarters to discuss border defense deployment and plans to eliminate the remnant bandits. It was decided that the division headquarters would be located in Shaozhou to provide central support, the 125th Brigade's battalion headquarters would be located in Nanxiong, and the 126th Brigade's battalion headquarters would be located in Yingde. The search and suppression of the remnant bandits would be the responsibility of three districts. The area from Shaoguan to Nanxiong would be the first district, under the charge of Huang Yanzhen's unit of the 125th Brigade. The 249th Regiment of that brigade would be stationed in Nanxiong, Jiangkou, and Shixing, and the 250th Regiment would be stationed in Renhua, Lechang, and Ruyuan. The area below Shaoguan would be the second district, under the charge of the 126th Brigade. The 252nd Regiment of that brigade would be stationed in Wushi, Shakou, and Maba. The third district would be the Xiaobeijiang area, under the charge of Deng Hui's unit of the 3rd Independent Regiment, stationed in Hanguang, Yangshan, and Lianxian. As for Dayu above Nanxiong, Yan Yingyu's regiment would be transferred to guard it, consolidating the border. With the deployment finalized, Division Commander Li plans to depart from Shaozhou within the next few days to inspect the Guangdong border defense in Nanxiong, Dayu, and Shixing. The division headquarters has recently prepared a company of machine gunners to accompany and protect him. (April 5th)</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Shanxi Province Bank</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Re-Appoints a General Manager and Directors</p>
<p>The Truth About the Loan Has Not Yet Been Announced</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Since the General Manager of the Shanxi Provincial Bank, Xu Yiqing, and Associate Manager Jia Junchen left their posts one after another due to political changes, the Provincial Bank has long been in a leaderless state. The Provincial Government, in view of the sharp fall in provincial banknotes, believes that the Provincial Bank should be reorganized as soon as possible. A temporary meeting was specially convened yesterday, and upon the proposal of Shang Zhen, it was decided to appoint Gao Buqing as the General Manager of the Provincial Bank, and Chang Bingyi, Chou Zengyi, Li Shangren, Wang Xiang, Wang Xiange, Ge Weipan, and Xue Shixuan as directors of the Provincial Bank. Guo Baoqing, Zhang Weiqing, and Wang Zhaotai were appointed as supervisors of the Provincial Bank. As for the Provincial Government's loan from British and American tobacco companies, although the Provincial Government has not yet clearly announced it, society is paying extraordinary attention to this matter. According to a certain important figure, since the second drawing of lots for redemption, the price of Shanxi banknotes has not rebounded but has fallen. Anyone with a little economic knowledge knows that if no relief measures are taken other than drawing lots to stabilize the price of provincial banknotes, it is feared that it will follow in the footsteps of Feng banknotes. Although the authorities have been racking their brains and trying every means to rescue it in recent days, they still cannot reverse the violent waves of its sharp fall. The gentry and business circles are extremely anxious. On the government side, since it has implemented the drawing of lots, it must carry out its proposition. Business figures have been making suggestions one after another to maintain Shanxi banknotes. Some advocate that the Provincial Bank should attract more commercial shares, and some advocate that the Chamber of Commerce should issue redeemable banknotes. However, both have their shortcomings. Recently, reports have stated that a loan of 20 million yuan has been taken out from British and American tobacco companies, but the official side is still denying it. However, according to the company's side, the loan case has indeed been established, with a total amount of about 20 million yuan, with 600,000 yuan being handed over each month. Of this, 500,000 yuan is used for monthly drawing of lots for redemption, and the remaining 100,000 yuan is used to subsidize administrative expenses. British and American tobacco companies are allowed to have exclusive sales rights in Shanxi and are exempt from special taxes. The Hādermén and other products of British and American tobacco companies currently sold on the market are extremely cheap. From all aspects, this loan case has indeed been established.

<h3>Wang Jun Sends Troops to Defeat the Bandits in Suxian</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: Wang Jun, the garrison commander of the Jinpu Railway, has been paying close attention to the defense along the Jinpu Railway. A month ago, he sent the artillery team of the 7th Division and an armored car team to Linhuai Pass to join the cavalry division of Zhang Lisheng to suppress the bandits in Linhuai. Subsequently, he sent the unit of Chen Chuanwen of the 70th Regiment of the 12th Division stationed on the Linzhao branch line to join the Lu army to encircle and suppress the bandits in Baodugang. Recently, a large group of bandits was discovered in Suxian in northern Anhui. The 11th and 12th regiments of the 2nd Cavalry Division stationed in Suxian went to suppress them. All sectors of Suxian repeatedly telegraphed the Garrison Headquarters, requesting that the central government send capable troops to attack. After receiving the telegram, Wang Jun ordered the unit of Gong Chaomei of the 39th Regiment of the 7th Division stationed in Fuliji to rush to join the suppression. The bandits were entrenched in the Dafang Temple area in the northwest of Suxian. After Gong's regiment launched an attack, the bandits could not withstand it and fled westward. At the same time, the 11th and 12th regiments of Zhang's division also defeated the bandits in Nieyashu, Xiaohongshan, and Laojiashan. The bandits fled westward in a disheveled manner. Gong and Zhang have now telegraphed Xuzhou to report. Wang still ordered Gong's regiment to temporarily station a part of its troops in Wuxi and Jiangding in western Suxian to search for the remaining bandits and telegraphed General Commander Chiang, giving rewards to Zhang's division for its efforts in suppressing the bandits this time, in order to encourage them. Now, Suxian has gradually become peaceful, but the bandits in Baodugang in Shandong are still being encircled and suppressed. (April 9th)</p>

<h3>&lt;Heaven and Earth Almost Lose Color P] 丨Zhang Zhizhen Offsides and Botches Things Up丨 Relocating to fight again, Furen changed their uniforms, offering a fresh look. Their fighting spirit was even more vigorous, probing forward several times, causing alarm. Lingnan's Chen Huang asked for directions, taking a diagonal route out of the pass towards Longmen. The three forwards all missed the opportunity. After twenty minutes, Furen, with the force of a thousand troops, swept across the field. Lingnan's inner guards acted improperly. Furen Deng Lu entered the room and was about to seize the flag and capture the pass, returning home in triumph. However, Zhang Zhizhen was too eager for success, and after moving forward, failed to return. Although the ball entered the goal, it was an invalid offside. A strike to the vital point. 丨Chen Hongguang's Reputation Is Well-Deserved丨 Furen pressed hard, fighting even more fiercely, but Lingnan's goalkeeper defended effectively, leading to fruitless efforts. With the final five minutes approaching, the ball still lingered in the mid-court. Suddenly, it flew into Furen's territory. Chen Hongguang descended like a god from the sky, rushing in. Under the shadow of his divine legs, the ball broke through the net. The defender could only clap alone, unable to bear the blame. In the blink of an eye, Furen also led troops in a fierce attack. Cao Yu of the right wing broke out in front of the crowd, shooting at the goal, missing by only a foot. Because this ball did not go in, Furen failed with a score of zero to one.

Important News Ministry of Education Informs Various Agencies of Document Writing Methods The Ministry of Education, upon the order of the Executive Yuan, instructed the Ministry of Personnel Review to inform the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, the Weihaiwei Management Office, and the directly affiliated colleges, schools, universities, and educational institutions of the following document: "According to the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 1490, (Approved by the Examination Yuan's Consultation No. 31, regarding the matter of consultation, the Ministry of Personnel Review previously reported that since its establishment, documents from various provincial departments and bureaus have been submitted either as 'reports' or 'letters.' Therefore, the Ministry has also used 'orders' or 'letters' accordingly. According to the format of official documents, agencies that are not subordinate should use 'letters.' However, since personnel review involves the appointment, dismissal, promotion, and demotion of civil servants, it seems appropriate to use 'orders' for ease of supervision. It is now proposed that in the future, when corresponding with agencies within the central ministries and commissions, the responsible ministries and commissions should forward the documents. When corresponding with agencies outside the capital and departments and bureaus under the provincial governments, the regulations on the use of 'orders' for instructions or criticisms should be followed. All documents from these agencies should be submitted as 'reports' to maintain consistency and facilitate supervision. Please review and record this matter.) The instruction was approved and recorded. It is now reported that it is requested that it be distributed to the various academies to inform their subordinate agencies to comply with the previous instructions. This should be approved. In addition to the instructions and distribution, corresponding notices should be issued to ensure compliance, and subordinates should also be informed to comply.)" This was approved. In addition to the instructions, compliance is ordered. This order.

This Port's Jinan University and Central University Jointly Form a Songjiang Education Survey Team The Survey Work is Divided into Four Main Purposes Provincial Songjiang Middle School Prepares to Welcome Lectures Zheng Hongnian, the president of Jinan University in this port, and Zhu Jiahua, the president of Central University in the capital, are enthusiastic about promoting scientific educational research and promoting the practical effectiveness of education. They planned to connect the education colleges of the two schools and jointly organize the Songjiang County Education Survey with the Songjiang County Education Bureau. A committee was organized in advance, with Meng Xiancheng as the chairman, Xie Xun Chu and Ni Hanchen as members, and Tai Shuangqiu and Zhang Yaoxiang and other eight people as instructors. After several discussions on the plan, preparations have been completed. The main purposes of the survey are (1) to formulate an education plan, (2) to measure education efficiency, (3) to improve education facilities, and (4) to commend education achievements. The survey team is scheduled to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train to Songjiang tomorrow afternoon to engage in practical work. The Central University team has about ten members, led by Cheng Chichiu, Wang Shulin, and Xia Zhanchu. The Jinan University team has more than thirty members, led by Xie Xunchu, Tai Shuangqiu, and Zhang Yaoxiang. Today, various application forms will be distributed to male and female team members. After arriving in Songjiang, they will stay at the county high school. The county education bureau is responsible for the reception. Chen Jingzhi, the principal of the provincial Songjiang Middle School, has prepared to welcome the instructors to give lectures at the school. Special Coverage: Life at Wellesley College (1) Sent from the United States by Ms. Lu Erzhao Erzhao has been in school since the fall, and half a year has passed in a hurry. In this half year, apart from Mr. Xie, who is from the same country, and childhood classmates, another person is a Japanese from the same continent. The rest, those who teach face to face, those who advance and retreat together, those who study a department together, those who form a team to compete in sports, those who swim together, those who stroll and rest, and those who sing and chant together, are all people from different continents and countries. The skin color is different, the customs are different, the preferences are different, and every move, every drink, and every meal are different in general terms. However, among the many differences, there is one point that is not different, which is school life. The school life recorded by Erzhao has no strange points at first, and is mostly old-fashioned talk. However, school life is education, not magic. It is cultivating good commonality, not a training ground for manufacturing strange people. Without considering my humble knowledge, I will briefly record a few points as follows: (1) Creating Ability (2) Honesty and No Deceit (3) Occupational Equality (3) Promoting Physical Education (1) American female students carefully study the music sung at meetings, various performances, and the arrangement and color distribution of the meeting place, even the wearing of a hat and the decoration of a scarf, striving for freedom and never wanting to follow the same old ways, completing things for others, and reflecting on their own brains. Naturally, they work hard to study the subjects, striving for their own understanding, without saying. Recalling the evening of October 8th (the 19th year of our country, i.e., 1930), the school had a social event to exchange knowledge and connect feelings between new and old students. However, it was stipulated that each freshman should talk to an old student eight times, each time for ten minutes. That night, the clouds were clear, the sky was high, and the moon was as bright as a mirror. The cool breeze was blowing, and it felt like ascending to immortality (that night was the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival in our country). A first-year student took Erzhao's hand and walked together, and suddenly asked, "Is the moon in China so round and bright?" The words were very abrupt and difficult to answer suddenly. Then he said that in ancient China, the moon was used as a calendar. Tonight, the moon is full, so it must be the 15th day of the month, and the ebb and flow of tides in the southeastern provinces also have a relationship. Now, the solar calendar is used, and all countries follow the same. However, the moon shines on the earth, and the time is different. The light does not increase or decrease. The time difference between China and the United States is about 14 hours. He heard it happily. Erzhao then cited the Tang Dynasty poet's sentence, "(Tonight, a round moon is full, where is the clear light absent?)" to explain that the moonlight is the same everywhere. When he heard the Tang Dynasty poet's sentence, he began to study poetry. However, Erzhao only knows a little bit, how can she be a professor of poetry? Just as they were asking and answering, the time came to the rescue. Everyone's ten minutes were up, so they had to shake hands and say goodbye. Americans are eager to understand new knowledge that they have never heard of, and this desire to seek novelty and progress is revealed everywhere. Students from ordinary families often work and study to earn money to pay for expenses, such as answering telephones, receiving letters, and managing writing materials. There are also work-study positions in libraries, infirmaries, etc. They work one hour or two and a half hours every day, taking on duties in the morning and afternoon to pay for their studies, which is more than enough. However, the school authorities must see that the student has a considerable record of scholarship and conduct before entrusting them with the task. American school spirit is to reward diligent and excellent students from poor families, and all schools have this kind of approach. However, male students in male schools have jobs such as preparing meals and washing clothes, and it is said that they are purely natural and never discriminate. Many great scholars, great industrialists, and great politicians have all started from work-study students. Giving preferential treatment to work-study students is an important matter in school administration, and work-study students strive to do their best in their duties, thinking of various convenient and ingenious methods to win the other party's favor and show their personal talents. This is also a visible manifestation of the spirit of creation. (2) Teachers and students in the school attach great importance to the word "honesty". In class, in exams, in work, every move has the word "honesty" imprinted in the brain and manifested in the matter. The Bible emphasizes honesty, and all ancient sages in our country have cultivated from the word "honesty". Those who are above, God is with you, gentlemen are cautious, the shadow of the quilt is not ashamed, burning incense to tell the sky, nothing cannot be said to others, and so on are countless. Our country's learning of honesty was invented as early as three thousand years ago, but American students can practice it with real strength and never slacken. Recalling one day when I was referring to course materials in the library, a classmate extracted several sections of needed materials. During the exam, the topic happened to be mostly in line with the extracted materials, and the paper with the extraction happened to be in the bookshelf. The classmate took out this paper and presented it to the professor to show honesty. The school's sales department is indeed managed by students, and when the manager is sometimes out, the buyer goes directly inside, takes the goods, pays the price, and pays in full. The accounts are settled monthly, and the value of the goods matches, and there is never any shortage. Other things such as rain gear, sports equipment, and swimming items, whether public or private, must have a mark. If they are accidentally forgotten or borrowed by others, they must be returned to the original person and place and never lost. Work-study students are very cautious about their duties, because if they can be competent in school, they will naturally be competent in society. This is Mr. Dewey's principle that school is society. If the reputation in school is not bad, the ability can be developed in the future. As the saying goes, reputation is the second life, and honesty is one of the places where reputation is produced, so the learning of honesty is equal to the second life, which is no different from the ancient people in our country who met with sincerity.

Ministry of Railways Dispatches a Study Group to Japan Eighteen Members Will Cross to the East Tomorrow Study in Japan for 40 Days The Ministry of Railways is actively rectifying the road administration and has been organizing a group to study Japanese railway machinery plants. After half a year of preparation, it has recently matured. Minister Sun specially appointed Cheng Xiaogang, a technical expert of the Ministry, as the head of the group, leading members sent by the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Tianjin-Pukou, Bei Ning, Jiaoji, and Longhai lines, a total of 18 people. They have now concentrated in the [I&gt;Photo of the study group to Japan (taken by this museum) &lt;I]Hai, scheduled to cross to the east tomorrow morning at 8:00 by the Shanghai Maru, study in Japan for about a month and a half, return to the country via Dalian, inspect the South Manchurian Railway and the North China Railway factories, and then return to Beijing to report. Declaration of Going Abroad Although countries such as Britain, Germany, Japan, and Canada have successively sent commercial study groups to China, this is the first time that our country has sent a study group to foreign countries. Therefore, the reporter of this newspaper specially visited the head of the group, Cheng Xiaogang, to talk about the mission of the group. Head Cheng also issued the group's declaration of going abroad, saying, "Since the end of the war last year and the completion of unification, the government has been working hard on the construction of the training period and paying special attention to the organization and development of transportation. Railway is the lifeline of transportation, and it is imperative. The Ministry of Railways is making every effort in operation and planning. In addition to actively completing the Guangdong-Hankou and Longhai lines, looking around the current situation of each line, all are scarred and riddled with holes. Most of the locomotives and vehicles are damaged, and the repair and replacement of old and incomplete items all depend on the efforts of the railway factories. Therefore, special attention is paid to the equipment and work of each factory. However, the reorganization plan must have an overall plan, and it is especially important to learn from advanced countries. It was originally intended to send personnel to Europe and the United States to study and learn from them. However, the journey is long and time-consuming, and Japan is close to the East, and its railway factories are very well run. It is necessary to study them first. Therefore, each line was ordered to send important mechanical personnel and organize a study group. The Ministry sent personnel to lead them to Japan for practical research. The purpose of this trip is different from ordinary visits. It is intended to take their strengths and make up for our shortcomings. After returning to the country, it will be implemented immediately. Therefore, the scope of the study must be detailed. The Japanese Ministry of Railways has expressed its welcome to this and has appointed personnel to receive and provide all information for the group. It is now scheduled to cross the sea on April 13 and stay in Japan for about 40 days. The study group has a total of 18 people, all of whom are railway mechanical experts and important current officials of the Ministry and roads. They are familiar with the situation and have a personal stake. In the future, after the study is completed, there will be a detailed plan to contribute to the authorities as the basis for reorganization." Mr. Cheng also told reporters that the national railway revenue is as high as 100 million yuan per year, and the expenses are about 50 to 60 million yuan, while the repair of railway vehicles accounts for 30 million yuan, so the repair is very important. List of Members Head: Cheng Xiaogang, sent by the Ministry of Railways Members: Sun Xuexiu, sent by the Ministry of Railways Zhong Guidan, Liu Huanwei, Sun Jialu, Zheng Baosan from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines Xiong Zhengwan, Zeng Guangzhi, Chen Guangyuan, Gu Qiwen from the Tianjin-Pukou line Yuan Lianyao, Gu Yantong, Nie Zhaoling, Sun Wenzao from the Bei Ning line Song Baode, Luan Fu from the Jiaoji line Lu Tingjun, Xu Zhonghuai from the Longhai line Study Schedule The group will cross to the east from Shanghai tomorrow morning, arrive in Nagasaki the next day, stay for three days, inspect the Nagasaki Shipyard of Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Company, arrive in Tokyo on the 17th, stay for eight days, inspect the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, the Railway Ministry Research Institute, the Shibaura Manufacturing Plant, the Omiya Factory, the Oi Factory, and visit the Tokyo Municipal Government, travel to Nikko Ueno, Ueda, Hakone, Numazu, and Hamamatsu from the 25th to the 28th, inspect the Hamamatsu Factory on the 29th, arrive in Nagoya on the 30th, inspect the Japan Vehicle Manufacturing Factory, visit Inuyama on May 1st, go to Kyoto that night, stay for three days, inspect various art</p>

<h3>Record of the Blood Garden by Chen Danyan</h3>
<p>In the winter of the 15th year of the Republic, Mr. Yan Lisan, the commander of the Independent 21st Division of the National Revolutionary Army, led 8,000 of his troops through Shaoguan, crossed the Dayu Mountains, and arrived at Changshan, Zhejiang. Although the journey was as fleeting as a white horse passing through a crack, it lasted more than three months. In February of the following year, they fought fiercely with Sun Chuanfang between Longyou and Tonglu. Battalion Commander Zhao Jingtong died in battle, and countless others were wounded or killed. On the 18th of that month, they captured Hangzhou. Our army searched everywhere along the way, and it was not until the next day that they were fully assembled. At that time, the rebel army was still stubbornly entrenched in Wujiang, trying to fight like a cornered beast. Our division, enjoying the reputation of successive victories, had high morale. Without waiting for the completion of the fortifications, they launched a fierce attack. The enemy was caught off guard, and the entire line collapsed. Many were captured. One night, a faint sound of night watch was heard. Our army, winding its way, entered Xumen from under the Jade Belt Bridge. At dawn, the women and children of the city realized it, cheering and dancing, showing extreme excitement. Wumen is an area of ancient scenic spots. Canglang and Huqiu are interspersed, adding much interest. The people are also handsome and pleasing. Elders like Zhang Yixiang and Yipeng brothers are worthy of admiration for their hard work in planning and running around. In early summer, our division moved to Jinling, and the Jiangzhe campaign came to an end. Soon, Mr. Yan resigned from his position as division commander because he could not bear the fatigue. The central government, appreciating his sincerity, granted his request. He then settled down at the foot of the South Peak in West Lake. The sounds of chanting and bells comforted the loneliness. He sought advice from the monks of Faxiang Temple and purchased several acres of land at his residence for 2,700 yuan to create a cemetery for the Jiangzhe fallen soldiers of our division. He entrusted the matter to Mr. Yuan Shouqian and Hu Xienan to oversee. Once determined, they cut through thorns and searched for the remains, entrusting everything to them. As the tomb tower was initially completed, two leading members of our party, Mr. Tan Zu'an and Wu Zhihui, separately inscribed "Blue Blood and Loyal Heart" and "Heroic Spirit of Lakes and Mountains" on the tomb entrance. Mr. Yu Youren also inscribed the inscription on the tower plaque. Looking at the overall view, the mountains and lake surround it, further highlighting its strength and vigor. Climbing the steps, there is a memorial hall, and further up, there is the Watching Tide Pavilion, echoing remotely with the Quanjiang River. The surroundings are surrounded by short walls, with tea trees and wisteria intertwined, competing in beauty. Upon completion, Mr. Yan named it the Blood Garden, meaning that the blood of the martyrs and the flowers of doctrine are the true reflection. On April 5, the 20th year of the Republic, I and my classmates Yuan Qizhi and He Tianlin paid our respects there. We deeply felt the courage of our comrades in killing the enemy at that time and the heroic sacrifice of those comrades. Looking back, it has been four years in a hurry. The rise and fall of world affairs and the coldness of human feelings make one seek the once fervent spirit of striving for the people's livelihood and the strict discipline of the officers and soldiers of our division, but now there is almost no trace to be found. Thinking of it, I cannot help but shed tears.</p>
<h3>Artistic Anecdotes by Chen Boying</h3>
<p>The painter's brush has already controlled creation and commanded all things. When they occasionally play tricks, it can also make people smile. Zhang Chunrong was from Zhangxiang, Fengxian. He was good at painting crabs, and his price was one yuan per crab. Someone wanted to test him and offered two and a half yuan to ask him to paint. When it was completed and viewed, he painted two crabs walking one behind the other, and another crab entering the reeds, with only half of its body visible. Another person offered one hundred yuan, privately calculating that he would get one hundred crabs. When he got the painting, he drew a large bamboo basket with two crabs just climbing out of the basket, another crab descending the basket, almost touching the ground, and another crab walking on the ground. The recipient thought there were too few crabs and complained. Chunrong said, "Don't be dissatisfied. How could there be only one hundred crabs in this big basket? It's just that you can't count them." Don't be dissatisfied. There was also Fei Danxu, whose style name was Xiaolou, from Huzhou. Before he became famous, he was very poor, living in the City God Temple in Gui'an. He had no cotton-padded coat in winter and no mosquito net in summer. He relied on selling paintings for a living, making album leaves of ladies, each for two hundred cash. If someone bargained for half the price, he would draw a side view, creating a Xu Fei makeup. If there were acquaintances who did not give money and pestered him to paint, he would draw a scene of leaning on a railing looking into the distance or watching the moon in the courtyard, leaving only the back view and not seeing the front. In the past, when Zheng Banqiao was guarding Yangzhou, Zhang Tianshi passed by, and a salt merchant asked Banqiao to write a couplet as a gift. Zheng demanded one thousand gold, and the merchant offered five hundred gold. Zheng wrote the line "The true prime minister in the Dragon and Tiger Mountains" but stopped writing. The merchant hurriedly offered another five hundred gold, and he completed it with the line "The living immortal in the Kirin Pavilion." His humor is similar to this.</p>
<h3>Postscript to the Album of Calligraphy and Painting in the Late Evening Hall by Huang Binhong</h3>
<p>China calls the prosperous periods of governance "Han" and "Tang". The capital of Han, Chang'an, is now the land of Shaanxi. Its cultural reforms were also most powerful during the Han and Tang dynasties. During the period of the Zhou and Qin dynasties, the seven kingdoms fought, and the written characters were different, each acting on its own. The Han Dynasty inherited the rule of the Qin Dynasty and unified the territory. The seal script, clerical script, and cursive script all changed from the old forms of ancient scripts. After the Wei and Jin dynasties, Gu Kaizhi, Lu Tanwei, and Zhang Sengyou made painting even more refined. As for the Tang Dynasty, Wang Wei and Li Sixun opened the Northern and Southern schools. Those who talk about calligraphy and painting all revere them. For thousands of years, times have changed, and the world has undergone great changes. It is no longer in its full prosperity. Furthermore, wars have occurred repeatedly, and famines have struck frequently. The people suffer, unable to save the dying. It is shocking and heartbreaking, and listeners are terrified. My old friend Mr. Yan Ganyuan was born during this period. He had talent and stood out from the crowd. He should have been able to help the world and correct the times, comparable to Xiao He and Cao Shen, and on par with Yao Chong and Wei Yuanzhong, to see the peace of this world. However, he was aloof and out of place, drifting and moving, living in seclusion in Shanghai. To alleviate his boredom, he used calligraphy and famous paintings to entertain himself in his old age. When he had spare time, he would dip his brush and create seal script, clerical script, regular script, running script, as well as landscapes, figures, flowers, and birds. He never tired of studying the ancients. His discussions on the essential points of calligraphy and painting all hit the mark and were very different from the current fashion. In the past, he exhibited his works to raise money for the disaster relief in Shaanxi Province. His ambition is truly lamentable. Alas! Heaven does not want the people to live in peace, but it cannot stop the rise of culture. Eastern learning is gradually spreading to the West, jumping over the ancients and revitalizing the present, continuing the lost threads of the sages and opening up new knowledge for later generations. Although art is insignificant, the great way exists within it. Where there is sincerity, metal and stone can be opened. The influence of ink rain and European winds has not yet reached its limit. Subtle changes will surely penetrate people's hearts. In the vast world, how can it be just the glory of one family or one country?</p>
<h3>Epitaph for the Virtuous Woman Jin by Hong Jingshan</h3>
<p>The virtuous woman, Li, was from Xiangshan, Zhejiang. At the age of seventeen, she married Jin of Cixi as his second wife. Jin made his living by fishing, and several times he fished in the sea and did not return. The virtuous woman stayed at the home of her husband's aunt, Gong. Gong had an affair with a merchant named Tang, and the scandalous rumors spread throughout the neighborhood. The virtuous woman often wept in secret, hoping to restrain herself strictly and treat her aunt with sincerity and filial piety. As a result, Gong became more cautious. Over time, Tang was attracted to the virtuous woman's youth and beauty and thought of defiling her as well. He threatened Gong and tempted her with generous bribes. Gong was also jealous of the virtuous woman's exclusive chastity. She willingly succumbed to Tang's coercion and tried every means to force the virtuous woman, but the virtuous woman was not moved. Moreover, she took the opportunity to advise Gong with great righteousness, cutting off one of her fingers with a knife to show her determination. Gong became even more angry. She dug a hole to create a prison, stripped the virtuous woman naked, and imprisoned her. She subjected her to branding with hot irons. From May to August, she never yielded. On the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, they planned to pour boiling water on her to kill her. By chance, an old woman sought a worker to stay at their home and begged for mercy. The sky had just cleared when suddenly wind rose and clouds gathered, and thunder rumbled. Gong was frightened and stopped. The next day, the old woman told her neighbor. The neighbor usually despised Gong's behavior and admired the virtuous woman. She became even more indignant and could not remain silent. She immediately summoned more than ten women from the village and entered her house. As the old woman had said, they took the virtuous woman out of the hole. Her muscles were festering, pus and blood were flowing, and maggots were crawling all over her body. They washed and clothed her and carried her on a door panel. They tied up Gong and brought her to the magistrate. The magistrate interrogated them. The virtuous woman was barely breathing. She forced herself to say, "Fortunately, I have not let my husband down. The magistrate is here. This is fate." And with a painful cry she died. Thereupon, Gong was sentenced to strangulation, and the virtuous woman was commended by the court. This happened on August 20th of the third year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty. The virtuous woman's tomb is beside Cihu Academy. Now, several decades have passed. The people of the county admire her virtue and have repaired her tomb and erected a stele, and they have asked me to write her story on the stone. I think that what the virtuous woman encountered can be described as the most extreme and bizarre change in human relations. Usually, she had never studied, but she was able to endure bitter poison and mutilate her limbs to achieve her bright and unsullied will with her death. Even if gentlemen face hardship, establishing their virtue and principles to show themselves, what more could they add? Isn't this because the teachings of the former kings are based on the fundamental principles of the people, so that they can deeply penetrate people's hearts and not become outdated over time? But the people of today want to destroy and abandon them, indulging themselves in bestiality as if it were a pleasure. What is the meaning of this?</p>

<h3>Zheng Sukahn's Method of Maintaining Health by Man Yin</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng Sukahn is famous throughout the country for his calligraphy, and his poetry and prose are also profound and beautiful, forming his own unique style. Recently, he has been living in seclusion in Tianjin, detached from worldly affairs. He is already seventy-two years old this year, but this old gentleman is healthy and stronger than most people, and he walks as fast as if he were flying. People in their forties and fifties often cannot keep up with him. The appearance of a bald head and missing teeth is nowhere to be seen. I heard that the first secret of Mr. Zheng's ability to do this lies in eating less. Every day, he only eats a bowl of thin porridge in the morning, supplemented with salted pickled vegetables. Only the porridge is cooked by his own hand. At lunchtime, he only eats two or three pieces of bread and avoids oily and heavy foods. He eats even less at night. In fact, the amount he eats each day is less than one-third of what ordinary people eat. If someone invites him to a banquet, Zheng also attends as usual, but he does not often use his chopsticks. People say that eating less is not impossible, but eating less will inevitably lead to hunger, which is difficult for people to bear. Perhaps this is due to practice. The method of fasting is not something that ordinary people can achieve. In addition to diet, he also pays attention to his daily life. I heard that Zheng always goes to bed late, around 9:00 PM, and gets up at 3:00 AM. Those who are called early risers often say that they get up at dawn, but Zheng does not have so-called dawn. He gets up in the lamplight. It is said that all his writings are done during this period. The servant grinds ink and spreads paper for him to write. He writes from midnight until dawn every day. Therefore, Mr. Sukahn named his residence "Night Rising Studio." Since there are many writings, the income is also abundant. The rest of the time is spent reading and composing poetry. People ask him how he can be so strong, and there must be another way to maintain his health. Mr. Sukahn smiles and does not say anything. Then he says, "If I can live to eighty, I will reveal my method of maintaining health to others." When asked why he doesn't show it to people sooner, he says, "I am seventy years old and not yet long-lived. How do I know if my method of maintaining health is effective? How can I deceive myself and others? If I reach eighty, I can show some evidence of its effectiveness." However, his friends believe that Mr. Sukahn will certainly be able to reach the age of one hundred.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes of India (21) by Ling Hua</h3>
<p>7th. People from all walks of life held a welcoming ceremony for the Sri Lankan monks at the Great Vehicle Buddhist Society because nine monks were going to Sarnath University, also known as Deer Garden, where the Buddha first turned the Dharma wheel. The monk named Dharmaloka (meaning "love of wisdom"), etc., was the head of the monks. He had just come from Sri Lanka. Many people attended the meeting. Dr. D. R. Bhandarkar, a professor of philosophy at the university, was the chairman. The Chinese consul and his wife also attended. The speakers included an Austrian woman, currently a professor of art at the university, Klasum, etc. It was very grand. Everyone shouted that the revival of Indian culture would be the great teacher of world culture to replace the barbarism of human killing. The monks lived in the Great Vehicle Buddhist Society. It is strange that the secular monks ate separately from the lay people at the table. Those who saw them would also perform the hand-wiping-foot ceremony. The Sri Lankan monks were different from the Burmese. They were mostly vegetarians. Originally, there were many ascetic sects in Hinduism, more than in Buddhism. At that time, when the Buddha sat in meditation for six years and attained enlightenment, the Indian heretics did not recognize him, saying that they had been sitting for eight years and had not yet attained enlightenment. The prince could not endure asceticism. The Buddha did not necessarily advocate asceticism. As for the monks of Sri Lanka, they are generally similar to those of Burma but different from Hinduism. They are also not like the Chinese monks who are absolutely vegetarian. This is probably because the begging system must be convenient. Chinese monks do not beg; they are all free.</p>
<p>8th. Many friends advised me to study Indian philosophy. I really do not have this time. However, there are two books that are most popular in the British-Indian academic world and are sure to show me to know. I browsed through them and found that they were the biographies of the Jin Dynasty monk Faxian and the Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang. These two books are very precious to the British because they record the journey from China through the Western Regions to India. With this, they can proceed according to the map, managing India, Tibet, and various places in the Western Regions with ease. The Indians also like their publicity about Indian culture. These are the most honorable ancient Chinese students. However, according to the examination, Faxian came first, and Xuanzang came later. Faxian was more difficult, while Xuanzang had the greatest reputation and achievements. They both traveled west from Chang'an, through the Western Regions and back to the area, and went down the upper reaches of the Ganges River in the northwest corner of India, so they both passed through more than thirty countries and experienced great hardships. Xuanzang returned by land, and Faxian returned by sea. Faxian lived in Calcutta for two years and in Sri Lanka for two years. He went by merchant ship to Java and from Java through Guangdong, returning to Zhejiang. The merchant was from Yangzhou. Faxian traveled to the West for twelve years. Xuanzang was seventeen years old. According to the preface, Faxian obtained 400 kinds of scriptures. Xuanzang obtained 657 volumes. Faxian's contribution was also great. When Xuanzang returned to the east, twenty horses carried the scriptures. It can be known that it was much. These were all gifts from India to China. At that time, they all came empty-handed on foot, begging, and returned with a full load. India's contribution to me is not only spiritual but also material.</p>

<p>Commercial News - Finance - Gold Prices Turn Downward Sharply</p>
<p>Major players aggressively sell, driving down prices by eleven taels. Yesterday, the 11th, gold prices saw a decline again, with a weakening trend. Major players aggressively selling was a noticeable stimulus, and market sentiment was weak among traders. From morning to noon, there were fluctuations totaling thirteen taels, with some advances and retreats in between. As a result, prices fell more than eleven taels. Meanwhile, exchange rates were stable externally but loose internally, and there were no changes in overseas silver markets. Although gold prices opened fairly stable, Yongheng, Yuancheng, Daxingyong, and other sellers showed strong selling pressure, causing a sharp downward turn. It was almost like a violent storm, with prices plummeting by more than ten taels. By noon, exchange rates were even looser, suddenly breaking through 710 taels. It is said that large bars may be lengthened this morning. In the afternoon, the market closed as usual on Saturdays. This week, the market atmosphere turned from strong to weak, and the difference between high and low prices was about thirty-five to thirty-six taels, a drop of sixteen taels and five qian compared to before the customs closure.</p>
<p>The morning opening was fairly stable, and there were no changes in large bars. The May futures market opened slightly higher by one tael, at 721 taels. Large bars remained unchanged, but private telegrams only rose by one-sixteenth, which was not significant. Later, Daxingyong, Yuancheng, Yongheng, and others began selling first. In addition, exchange rates seemed to show signs of loosening. In June, the British-Japanese Bank first entered 133,125 British gold, followed by Huabi and North Korea mutually dealing 375 British gold, so gold prices fell by three to four taels. Furthermore, San Fei sold 375 British gold for May. By the time the advance order was announced, there were only fourteen taels, and the listed price did not change. Internally, it was still stable. Moreover, due to Yuannao Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, and others buying, the price returned to a high of more than four taels, at 18 taels and 5 qian. HSBC absorbed 375 British gold for June. At 9:45, the market suddenly softened again, immediately losing two to three taels. Then it added back two taels. There were three taels of fluctuation in just over ten minutes, which was actually due to different buying and selling, and people's minds were hesitant. At 10:00, Yongheng, Yuancheng, and Yuancheng Yong and others were enthusiastic about selling, and the price depreciated by more than two taels again. At 10:20, it was 14 taels and 5 qian. Shortly after, Maihang and Zhengjin and others bought 4,375 British gold for June, and Shunli, Yuannao Yong, Wanxing, and Tongtaichang and others made some purchases, so the price gradually increased by more than four taels, rising to 19 taels after 10:30.</p>
<p>Selling pressure was strong, breaking through the ten tael mark. Then, the exchange rate market became looser. It was difficult to sell 4,375 British gold, and the price fell by more than two taels. At 11:00, Bingxing, Yu Da, Qianchangxiang, Tongtaichang, Yongheng, and others tended to sell again, so it fell to 13 taels at 11:10. At this time, Zhifeng Yong, Qianchangxiang, Wupin, and others took the opportunity to enter, immediately rising by three taels, to 16 taels. However, sellers did not stop. Yu Da, Tongtaichang, and others sold again and again, but the demand was not good. After 11:30, the price had already broken through 710 taels, at 09 taels. Suddenly, it pulled up more than two taels, to 11 and a half taels. However, the Japanese bank absorbed 135 British gold, but there were still many suppliers on the surface, and the situation was very tired. It was about to be noon when it suddenly reached 08 taels, and the bank had no intention to buy 135 British gold. By the time the market closed, it was 08 taels and 5 qian, a drop of eleven and a half taels compared to the previous day. The highest price in half a day was 21 taels, and the lowest price was 08 taels, a fluctuation of thirteen taels. The Wupin market opened at 21 taels in the morning and closed at 08 taels and a half in the afternoon. The announced price was still 777 taels, a difference of about 60 taels. At noon, it was 68.9 taels, registered at 09 taels, and 05 taels of water replenishment.</p>
<p>Transactions were busy, and there was a sound of emptying orders everywhere. Transactions in various numbers were busy, with sellers accounting for the majority. Yongheng continued to short, while Yuancheng, Xinheng, Chengfeng Yong, Yuanxingyong, Daxingyong, Fuyu, Cuichangyong, Yuantai, Yu Da, etc., were all selling. Futaiheng, Hengyu, Yuanheng, Longshen, Qianchangxiang, and Dadecheng, etc., were entering and exiting, and the numbers were not small. Shunli, Wanxing, Fuchang, and Yuanmaoyong and Zhifengyong all had purchases. Tongtaichang had more supply than demand. Wupin hedged, entered, and then exited. The Dalian gang bought 1,600 to 1,700 bars and sold 600 to 700 bars. The Guangdong gang did not complete the transaction because of the limit on the market.</p>
<p>Exchange rates are clearly stable but secretly tired.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets did not fluctuate much, but exchange rates saw an increase, and the exchange rates listed by HSBC did not change. The prices opened by the banks were stable but weak, but there were occasional rebounds. The gold prices had secretly fallen, breaking through the 710 tael mark, so there was a related effect. When the market closed at noon, the British gold was one and two-five longer than yesterday, the American gold was two-five longer, and the Japanese gold fell by one fen and two-five. The situation was clearly stable but secretly tired. Huashang like Fuchang and other hedging families were throwing out orders, so they added more notes. Although the banks were buying, they were not too enthusiastic about buying. About 200,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Taiwan, Shanghai Huabi, Mecca, and Zhengjin, Sumitomo, Mitsui, etc., made some purchases. Mitsui also sold some. There were few American gold transactions, and the Japanese gold was only in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars, which was still sold by the Dalian gang. There was usually no market situation after the market due to the weekend.</p>
<p>The fluctuation of British exchange rates in the internal market was 1875 in half a day. The bid price in the morning was one shilling, three pence, and two-five, and the buying price was three-one-two-five. Taiwan entered five or six months at three-one-two-five in the early morning, and Huabi and North Korea mutually made six months at three-seven-five. Mitsui sold at the same price. At 9:30, Mitsui Sumitomo sold to HSBC at three-seven-five, Shanghai absorbed four-three-seven-five, and then Huabi Maihang Zhengjin entered four-three-seven-five. Zhengjin bought another one-three-half, Macleary offered four-three-seven-five, and Zhengjin Sumitomo bought one-three-half this month at noon. Mitsui entered June at the same price. The bid price at noon was four-three-seven-five, and the buying price was one-three-flat or five-six-two-five.</p>
<p>The differential of American exchange rates in the internal market was three-seven-five. The bid price in the early market was 30 yuan and 0875, and the buying price was 31 yuan. The bid price at noon was 31 yuan and 25, and the buying price was 31 yuan and 375.</p>
<p>The rebound of Eastern exchange rates in the internal market from morning to noon was two fen. The bid price in the morning was one tael and six qian, and the buying price was one tael, five qian, and nine fen. Taiwan bought the existing Dalian at one tael, five qian, and eight fen and three-seven-five. Later, it bought another one tael and five qian and eight fen. The closing price at noon was one tael and five qian and eight fen, and the buying price was one tael and five qian and seven fen. The overseas silver market was stable.</p>
<p>According to the London telegraph, there was no change in the silver bar, with both near and far terms at twelve pence, nine-three-seven-five (equivalent to one shilling, three pence and two-five in British gold). There were few spot transactions, no special changes, and the market was calm. After the market closed, the market was silent. According to New York telegraph, American silver prices also did not rise or fall, with spot prices still at two corners and eight fen and one-two-five. British rose against American by zero-three-one-two-five, and American against British remained unchanged, at four yuan, eight corners, and five fen and nine-three-seven-five. Japanese-American was still calculated at 429 yuan and three-seven-five, and British-Japanese was still two shillings and zero-four-three-seven-five. Bombay spot increased by one anna, calculated at forty-three rupees and zero-one anna. British-Shanghai shilling returned short by half a penny, calculated at one shilling and three and a half pence. According to Reuters telegraph this morning, there were still no changes.</p>
<p>Foreign cents, chaotic silver dismantling, and white borrowing.</p>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and the banks were closed in the afternoon as usual, so the atmosphere was bleak. The market price for foreign cents in the market opened at 7 qian, 2 fen, and 6 li in the morning and 7 qian, 2 fen, 6 li, one hao and two hu and a half in the afternoon. The result was still not much different from the previous day, and the situation was very chaotic. The silver dismantling market both opened with white doubling, and there was no extra water to add for calculations. The transaction volume for foreign currency in the morning market was 1.62 million, and in the afternoon market, it was 515,000.

<h3>Securities - 96 bonds suddenly decline sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market situation of various bonds was as follows: The spot market was still sluggish, with a transaction volume of only 10,000 yuan. The futures market was very deserted. The total amount opened in the morning and afternoon markets was 3.6 million yuan. The 96 bonds declined particularly strongly due to active selling in the market. As a result, it fell by more than one yuan compared to the previous day. The trends of other bonds were peaceful, and the fluctuations in the morning and afternoon markets were minimal, with a slight contraction of six, compared to the previous day. The remaining prices increased by two to three corners, and the trend was still firm.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Military Law Office Judged the Ji-Cai Case: Former Municipal Administration Bureau Chief Ji Hewa and Zhouzhuang resident Cai Rushan were detained by the county in September of last year for involvement in reactionary activities. They were subsequently transferred to the Provisional Military Tribunal of the province for interrogation. After repeated hearings and cross-examinations, the judgment was delivered the day before yesterday. Cai Rushan was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, while Ji Hewa was returned to the High Court for further inquiry and handling. It is reported that Cai Rushan will be sent back to his original county for execution of the sentence.</p>
<p>Difficulties Arising in the Improvement of Single-String Taxation: Chen Jingshan, Director of Land Tax at the Finance Bureau, who was recently appointed by the Provincial Finance Department as the Director of the Jurong County Finance Bureau, intended to replace silver and rice collection with foreign currency, collecting it in two installments with a 40/60 split. The "string" served as the land price tax certificate, and the "single" served as the notification. All counties were to follow this model uniformly. However, the string only showed the amount in foreign currency. If payment was made within the prescribed time limit, people could pay according to the string. If payment was made outside the prescribed time limit, a late payment penalty would be added, causing problems. Previously, there was silver and rice as a standard, making assessment easy. Now, there is only the amount in foreign currency, and a standard must be found within the foreign currency amount to calculate the penalty. If the treasury collects cash directly, it can post a notice of the grain treasury to serve as a standard. Jiangyin uses the "casting string" method. The people handling these certificates in the countryside generally have limited arithmetic skills, making it difficult for them to calculate the penalty based on the foreign currency amount, which could easily lead to corruption. As for Jiangyin's sandy field and reed tax in silver, it is levied in different grades. The enemy donation, however, is collected uniformly based on the land area. Historically, when casting the strings for collection, although the silver was the same (one tael), the amount in foreign currency varied. The original string clearly listed the land area and donation items for easy reference. Now that everything is listed as a foreign currency amount, it will be even more difficult to find the standard for late payment within the foreign currency amount. If the first installment is 40% and the second installment is 60%, there would be no problem in a year of full harvest. However, in a year of disaster, when handling disaster relief, the current regulations stipulate that after the autumn survey, the reduction should be determined before casting the string for collection. Now, according to the form, there is a column for reducing the amount based on the harvest percentage. It seems that a new string will not be cast, but rather the original 60% string will be used, and the amount to be collected will be reduced according to the harvest percentage when the taxpayer makes the payment. This may work in a year of general disaster. However, if there are areas with total crop failure, areas with full harvest, and areas with half or 30-40% or 60-70% harvest, the consequences would be disastrous if a new string is not cast for collection. However, if a new string is cast, those with full harvest already have a string, which could lead to suspicion of double taxation. Even if this can be identified and prevented from causing confusion, it seems that this method was not carefully considered in the overall planning, resulting in shortcomings. Now, the Jurong County Finance Bureau's proposed string form will certainly be suitable for their own use. The concern is that other counties may find it unsuitable, and Jiangyin is likely not the only one. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Land Tax Directors of the Finance Bureaus of all sixty counties in the province, asking whether this form is suitable, whether there are other modifications that can be referenced, and what the methods for the old string form were, in order to learn from them and improve the system.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Arrest of a Bandit Suspected of Killing the Victim: Yu Meisheng, the head of the Huaiyin Police Brigade, received a tip yesterday stating that a bandit who had shot and killed two sons and injured the right arm of Zhu, the wife of Zhang Kaichun of Biejiying outside the west gate of the city last month, was now living as an adopted son in the Yang family in Daoshi Zhuang outside the south gate of the city, having changed his name to Yang Huairen. After receiving the report, Yu immediately dispatched the Detective Team Leader, Liang Jianguo, to lead a team to arrest and bring the suspect in. After interrogation, it was found that he was highly suspected of involvement in the Zhang Kaichun family robbery case. At 4:00 PM on the 7th, Yu prepared a document to send him to the Yang Qingxiang General Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Execution by Shooting of Three Bandits: According to the General Headquarters of the 25th Route Army, the 95th Brigade of the army had captured and handed over three bandits, Cheng Hengsen, Cheng Hengbiao, and Zhu Xiuchang. After repeated interrogations, they confessed to colluding with bandits. After investigation by appointed personnel, it was confirmed to be true. They were sentenced to death. At 2:00 PM on the 7th, the three bandits, Cheng Hengsen and others, were tied and taken to Shimatou An Shexia and executed by shooting.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Two Notorious Bandits Executed by Shooting: The Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office had previously apprehended two notorious Huai Si bandits, Liu Weiqing and Liu Guanzhi, in Shanghai. They were found to have gathered crowds, acted tyrannically, committed murder, robbery, and extortion, accumulating numerous cases. After rigorous interrogation, they confessed to all charges and were sentenced to death. This afternoon (the 10th) at 4:00 PM, the two criminals were brought to the office, their identities were verified, and a team was dispatched to escort them to the execution ground at the bus station outside Fuyun Gate in the city for execution by shooting.</p>
<p>Fraudulent and Murderous Bandits Apprehended: Zhang Chaofeng of Sanjiangying in the eastern countryside of the county had an elderly mother and enjoyed a comfortable life. This attracted the attention of bandits. Last winter, he received threatening letters from bandits demanding money, which Zhang ignored. Later, he was kidnapped by bandits, who then sent a letter demanding ransom money to Zhang's mother. Zhang's mother was anxious to save her son, but no one was available to negotiate with the bandits. Later, Sun Jicheng of Panjia Zhuang offered to go and negotiate on her behalf, asking for a fee of 300 yuan. Zhang's mother agreed to his request. After Sun left for a few days, he replied that the bandits wanted 7,000 yuan for the ransom, or they would kill the hostage. Zhang's mother, unable to raise such a large sum at home, borrowed around and collected 6,900 yuan, which she gave to Sun to take with him. Not long after he left, he replied that the hostage would be released in three days. Zhang's mother waited anxiously at the door, but not only did her son not return, but Zhang Chaofeng's body was found in the nearby Yanta River. His left eye had been gouged out by the bandits, and his hands were tied with lead wire, a truly tragic sight. The family members then took the body home for burial. In her grief, Zhang's mother considered sending Sun Jicheng to the authorities for punishment, but after much persuasion from relatives and friends, she ceased her pursuit. Unexpectedly, Sun Jicheng came again to demand a 300 yuan thank-you fee. When Zhang's mother refused, he immediately threatened her. Zhang's mother then came to the city a few days ago to file a report with the Public Security Bureau, detailing the kidnapping of her son and the loss of both life and money, requesting the arrest and punishment of the perpetrators, etc. The Public Security Bureau secretly ordered the Detective Team to arrest Sun Jicheng and others, bring them in for questioning, and investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob and Kidnap: At around 11:00 PM on the 9th, the home of farmer Sun Jingzhuang, who lived in Nanxingqiao Beidoufengbang in Ziyoucun outside the east gate, was suddenly raided by more than twenty bandits, all armed with pistols. They broke into the house, tied up Sun Jingzhuang and his nephew Xuexi with hemp ropes, dragged them into a boat, and looted the indoor clothing, belongings, and a farm boat at the river dock. When the Public Security Bureau heard the alarm, they immediately went to suppress and arrest the bandits along with the security team, but the bandits had already fled.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Entire Guild of Carpenters Goes on Strike: The daily wage for carpenters in the city was originally 46 cents of foreign currency. Recently, due to the rising cost of living, the carpenters collectively discussed a few days ago to demand an increase of 4 cents of foreign currency per day from the shops. They had negotiated with the employers several times, but no satisfactory solution was reached, resulting in a city-wide strike by the carpenters, which has lasted for three days without result. It is now heard that the employers are considering agreeing to an increase of 2 cents per day.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Large Number of Bandits Captured in Recent Days: After the joint suppression by the armies of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, banditry in the eastern countryside of Pinghu has been calmed. Recently, after the bandit leaders and deputy leaders, Taibao A Shu, Zhu Luo A Mei, were arrested, the remaining bandits fled east and west, and were captured by the army from time to time. In the past two days, about six or seven bandits have been captured within the territory of Pingyi. On the 9th, the troops stationed in Xincang captured the notorious bandit Cao Cao Wang Xiaodi in the southern countryside. He was Taibao A Shu's bodyguard. Also, Da Yan A Xiang was found in the home of a tenant surnamed Li in the city, and 46 agate beads were confiscated. On the same day, the Sanyihe Security Corps captured two bandits, Yu A Quan and Xia A Long. On the 10th, the security team captured Zhang A Da, who was a groom for the bandit leader Zhu Luo A Mei. Also, Wu Baogen was caught in Luwan Temple. They have all been sent to the county government for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Letters</p>
<h3>Letter from Cui Hualiang</h3>
<p>I recently read a report in the Yangzhong communication column of your newspaper on the 9th, stating that Hualiang was involved in the Construction Bureau staff's embezzlement of public funds. This is not in accordance with the facts, so I am requesting a correction to protect my reputation. The Zhuang family's donation was deposited at Yuanyong, Yuantong, and Heyuantong stores under the Construction Bureau before October of the 18th year, with guarantees from Du Chuqing and Gu Xianzhi. The receipts indicated an monthly interest rate of 8%. When monthly interest was paid, the stores only wrote that interest was paid for one or two months. The receipts are proof. Since the Bureau was changed to the Office last June, after Hualiang took over, the Office's various plans for the county, market, streets, Shajia Port wharf, and the construction of the Zhongyang Road and the opening of the Erdundian Port were all approved by the Construction Department, but the projects were limited by funding. The reason that they did not materialize is because the annual actual income from the county's acre tax and brokerage tax is only around five thousand dollars, as documented by the Department and county. Also, because the Office only has one technician, it is difficult to handle both internal and external affairs, so I asked someone to pay the interest on my behalf. The stores still only wrote that interest was paid for one or two months, as before. The handwriting can be checked. This spring, when I applied to the county government and the Construction Department to withdraw funds for construction, the stores said that the monthly interest on the loan had always been 1.5%, and that the person collecting the interest had pocketed some of it. After Hualiang heard this news, I started an investigation, and the Department's representative, Mr. Wang, also arrived. We worked together to investigate, and the money was recovered from the collector. Mr. Wang then transferred the funds to the store for safekeeping. In short, when the stores paid interest, they recorded 1.5% in their books, but the passbooks did not state the exact amount. It seems that the store staff who recorded the transactions are suspicious of keeping incomplete records in this way since the deposit was first made in the 18th year. Since Hualiang took over, I have never personally gone to the stores to pay interest. Now that the Department has investigated and clarified the matter, it has been determined that someone else was embezzling public funds, and the other details are even more untrue. I am requesting a correction to avoid the spread of misinformation. Respectfully, Cui Hualiang, April 10.</p>
<h3>Letter from Jin Wenqiu, Head of the Sixth District of Changshu</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: I am writing regarding the news item (Residents of the Sixth District Destroy the District Office) in the Changshu communication column of your newspaper's local communication section on April 10, which is not in accordance with the facts. The county is requisitioning labor for the construction of the Changtai section of the Zhenhu Provincial Road, and our district is complying with the order to start construction on the 6th of this month. The workers are all participating voluntarily. The Construction Bureau stipulates that all tea and water expenses are to be counted at a cost of ten cents per cubic foot of earth, which is to be distributed evenly. There has been no uneven distribution or destruction of our office. The road construction office was established by the Construction Bureau specifically to guide the workers in their work. The claim that it sent staff to the countryside to entrust the district office to follow the Ministry's promulgated method for buying civil land and providing funds for buying land is completely unfounded. I am concerned that this may mislead the public, so I am requesting a correction. Jin Wenqiu, Head of the Sixth District of Changshu County, April 10.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Football Friendly Match: Furen Tries Out Their Skills</h3>
<p>Result: Loss to Lingnan Zero to One</p>
<p>Today at 1:00 PM, Play Against the Hualing Team</p>
<p>The Furen University football team took advantage of the National Divisional Football Tournament being held in Shanghai to travel south with their teacher and set up camp on the Shanghai Bund. After watching the battles between the three northeastern and central divisions, they scheduled matches with various strong teams in Shanghai. Battle invitations were sent out on four occasions, and many responded. Their first opponent was the famous Lingnan team of Shanghai. Yesterday, the battle was held at the China Baseball Field. Furen tried out their skills, and their performance was remarkable. However, unexpectedly, they lost zero to one. The psychological state of the nearly one thousand spectators was largely one of pity, considering the loss unfortunate. The moving nature of their skills could be seen here. The referee was Tang Zhongguang. Today, starting at 1:00 PM at the same field, they will battle against the Hualing team. Those who appreciate the skills of these two teams should not miss it. The referee is Shen Huichun.</p>
<h3>Lingnan Team</h3>
<p>Tang Yongchun, Lin Guoyong, Feng Nianhan, Chen Pu, Huang Zhaoguang, Huang Yifang (above), Huang Zhaoming (below), Guo Weimin (below), Zhao Jie (above), Chen Hongguang, Liang Heng, Ouyang Yongyuan, Tang Wenwei (below), Deng Ruichao (above)</p>
<h3>Furen Team</h3>
<p>Wang Xingmin, Cui Yongxi, Dong Shizuo, Cai Zhanyun, Tang Guoliang, Li Fenglou, Ye Delu, Fang Gecun, Huang Suyuan, Cao Yu, Zhang Zhizhen</p>
<h3>The Outcome is Not Important</h3>
<p>丨Furen's Skills are Worth Appreciating丨</p>
<p>In terms of victory or defeat, Lingnan won and Furen lost. In terms of skill, Lingnan is certainly good, but Furen is especially worth appreciating. Statistically, the number of shots on goal was equal in the first half. In the second half, Furen had more shots than Lingnan. This is a matter of luck and misfortune, and it cannot be determined simply by the outcome. Furen's attacking and defending were fast, their passing was agile, and their internal defense was also very stable. However, the northerners are not used to soft fields. Yesterday, they encountered muddy and slippery ground, which caused great difficulty, not only diminishing their performance. The informed spectators praised them, saying that they were superior to North China and Central China in many aspects. Lingnan has been out of action for a long time, and their skills have deteriorated. Fortunately, Chen Hongguang, Chen Pu, Tang Yongchun, Feng Nianhan, Huang Zhaoguang, and others are still in good shape, allowing them to secure their victory over a strong opponent.</p>
<h3>Water and Fire Incompatible</h3>
<p>丨When Strong Meets Strong, It's Hard to Determine Superiority丨</p>
<p>With the declaration of war, the north and south made contact, exchanged attacks, and had equal opportunities. Circling and hovering, they remained mostly in the center of the field. The two goalkeepers stood and watched, as the internal defense was solid, resulting in few major plays. As time flew by and the game neared its end, it was difficult to distinguish superiority or weakness. Then, in a surprising move, a sudden attack occurred. Lingnan's Chen Hongguang took a powerful shot. Goalkeeper Wang Xingmin calmly caught the ball, raised his foot to kick it out, but Chen sacrificed himself to steal the ball, almost kicking it in. Furen counterattacked, with Zhang Zhizhen coordinating well with the forwards, who all entered the danger zone. In this critical situation, Tang Yongchun snatched the ball from the thick of the crowd and cleared the danger, and the situation was resolved. The first half ended with a score of zero to zero.</p>
