<p>會經濟陷於苦境。反要去破壞社會經濟的組織。使人民生路俱絕。所以我們就至少要做社會的生理學家·認清了經濟是政治的基礎。而又看到國民生計之艱難。便當以經濟建設去解除人民的苦痛。救濟國民的生計。中國有一個奇異的心理。往往以爲政府與人民是對立的。因而便以爲政府來講救濟國民的生計。未必政府劉人民有如是之眞切罷。同時。若是社會上有人假借人民的苦痛而作反動的政府宣傳。則不問其言論含有如何的煽動動作用。總以爲這種人替人民訴苦是多少有點誠意的殊不知此種心理。實是大誤。國家的基礎與社會的秩序。旣然是靠着國民生計問題之解决而鞏固而確立。則努力爲國民求生計之心。政府當然較人民爲急切。若政府爲人民謀生計之心不如人民自身之急切。則其政府必於政治基礎在於經濟的原理毫無半點認識。若是一個政府。旣然了解政治基礎在於經濟的道理。而其爲人民解决生計問題之心又反不眞切。這不特無此常理。而且亦背乎人情。爲的是人民的生計。關係於政府本身的基礎。人民的生計問題。就即政府本身的問題。政府要爲保障自身所託命的國家和社會之安寗。自不能不努力於人民生計之救濟。所以今日懷疑政府對於民生問題不努力謀解救的心理。是一種極謬誤的懷疑。在今日生民困苦的現象之下。惟有好亂之徒。才是對於人民的苦痛毫無眞切的感覺。所以他們一方面可以忍心販賣人民的苦痛。一方面代人民提出若干經濟的要求。煽亂耳目。使人民益發互相鬥爭起來。希冀把人民趕到謀生無路的絕境。然後逼成社會的大紛亂。而若輩破壤國家之目的。乃得達到。現在大家旣不可任人民被趕上謀生無路的絕境。所以唯一的方法。即在拿出十二萬分自信心。全國上下一致的來努力物質建設唯有物質建設才能鞏固國家。才能充實國力。才能培植社會的新生命。要全國上下一致的來努力經濟建設。必须人民與政府互相信賴。互相協助。尤其政府的各機關。乃至人民的各種職業團體。必須共同認定物質建設的目標。來互相信賴。互相協助。目前的大病。與其說是在於大家不懂得建設之需要。母寗說是在於大家不懂得建設之如何作法。許多人以爲政府把人民的經濟事業爭奪得來做。或人民把政府應辦的建設事業把持得來做。甚或爭奪不來。把持不來則變爲互相抵制。互相阻撓。便算是努力於物質建設。這種可笑可憐的現象。雖然不多見。但是如若普遍起來。不知又要釀成若何的混亂狀態。所以要正本清源必須大家此時認清。凡是經濟的建設事業。無論其經營管理之權屬諸人民或屬諸政府都須政府與人民通力合作。才能有所成就。中國人總是每遇經濟的事業所在。便是要個人獨立支配的所在。弄到結果。則民間的經濟事實。絕不想借助於國家的法律和保護的力量而求發展。而政府的經濟事業。則亦不想借助於人民的資力而求擴大。殊不知此種狹隘的舊心理。在家庭工業的社會。或未嘗行不通。若施之於近代大規模的複雜民族經濟生活的環境中。便無往而不失敗。總理在建國大綱裏面說。政府與人民協力做這樣做那樣。所謂協力。即可知凡於國計民生有重大關係的建設事業。必人民和政府通力協助。始能有成。要建設終於不外兩條路。一是利用外資。二是全靠中國自身的力量。外資又不肯利用。內力又不善利用。建設終必落空。如果要利用外資。也要拿出利用外資的自信心和决心。如果要靠中國民族自身的力量。則亦必拿出於人民與政府兩得其利的方法來通力台作。若帶一半畏葸心理。再加一半自私心理。則直無一事建設起來。總括言之。現國家在需要物質建設。已是非常迫切。而政府之感覺此種需要。亦不遜於一般人民。大前提已毫無猶豫。就全在事實上政府與人民互信互助。協力進行。現在大亂已平。以政府的政治法律及信用的種種力量作無形的資本。同時以社會一般人民的財力和人工作有形的資本。去舉辦各種物質建設。實在是極有把握的。只要全國上下。一致努力而已。</p>
<p>（三）整理敎育一個新國家的基礎。除法制與經濟兩誣種建設而外。最後還在敎育。中國民族必恃三民主義的建設而復興。已無可疑。而三民主義之必須成爲全部的敎育方針。亦已無可非議。但是現在的敎育。事實上是否適合於我們的標準。則無人敢作肯定的答案。眼前一個最奇異的現象。就是無論什麼學校。都把三民主義等等設爲黨義一科。興其他一切科目等量齊觀。以爲即此遂成爲世俗所謂黨化敎育。殊不知三民主義。一經變爲黨義科目。即黨義亦變爲新約全書。而所謂黨化學校者。亦即變爲敎會學堂。以敎會學堂過去所得的效果。來推測所謂黨化敎育的將來。則我們亦可斷定他的效果。必甚有限得可憐。這樣推行其所謂黨化敎育。眞不知糟蹋人到什麼地步。即此一例。可知現在事實上三民主義與全部敎育已被人分了家。即勉强敷衍他進了學校。亦不過供奉在聖經的敎室裏。爲若干學生得便宜學分的工具而已。舍此而外。三民主義的自然科學是沒有的。三民主義的社會科學也是沒有的。那裏還尋得着三民主義的敎育呢。因爲三民主義。旣被擱在敎育的門外。於是青年人求知的欲望。無可滿足。便只有任潔白的心地。給各種破碎混雜的思想佔領。長此下去。三民主義的文化。現在是决沒有萌芽茁長的田園。將來豈尚有繼續担負三民主義的國家使命的國良麼。即使退一步而考察現在敎育的本身。究竟是什麼內容呢。就科目上看去。似呼凡是自然科學·社會科學。都應有盡有。當然其中亦有不應有的·却有了。應有的·倒反沒有。不可一槪而論。但是究其內容。都是模倣外國。而並非完全針對中國自身需要所設的科目。更無由中國本身的歷史和事實或實際現象研究出來的科學。不理心理學也好。經濟學也好。任舉一科丶都是直接販賣幾本外國敎科書丶或從外國敎本抄譯而來的講義。雖然學術是不可有國界。但是中國本身所有的一切實際現象。在課本子內完全沒有地位。完全不入系統硏究的範圍。這不能不說內容太空虛了吧。因爲中國的科學貧乏空虛如此。於是青牟人求知的欲望。又無從滿足。便只有勉强凑擺些外國貨在腦集散裏。一旦出了學校門。投身到社會去做事。一個個都發見了他腦袋裏的外國貨並不能完全切合於實際上的應用丶無怪許多人在大學畢業了出來，還自怨自艾地說是失學的青年丶所以現在的敎育。三民主義的敎育。本已說不上丶連中國敎育四字。也不能名副其實。還有什麼可說。可是惟其如此所以益發感覺到敎育整理有急切的必要就現地中國的需要上說。爲一般農村子弟而設者。有鄉村敎育。爲增進國民生活技能而設者丶有職業敎育及成年補習敎育。爲培植文化而設者。有普通的中等敎育和高等敎育。爲養成師資而設者·有師範敎育。爲陶冶一般人的羣體生活而設者。有社會敎育。但在每種敎育當中。有無一個共同遵守的確定的敎育政策呢。沒有的。同是一類的學校。集合兩個以上的主辦人來問他們辦學的方針。便要發見幾種相反的答案。甚或章程上標明的敎育宗旨。與事實上所授的功課互相違背的。亦往往而有。這不過是就敎育上主要的幾種錯誤和缺陷而言。已覺有急切整理和補救的必要丶總而言之。現在根本就沒有樹立三民主義的敎育。而且幾乎沒有適應國家和社會眞實需要的敎育。中國民族的敎育政策是什麼丶有了政策丶實行到了沒有丶事實上敎育是什麼一種情狀。這都是値得注意的問題。假使不從這種種問題中確定出一個具體的敎育計劃來。切實施行。任　今日敎育的現象流轉下去。則敎育界上下節節交相不滿的危機。是不堪設想的。現在已是國家可以着手於敎育整理的時機。千百年的大計。乃至三民主義的社會永久生存。都在此時從敎育上植深厚的根基　　以上三點。是今後國民革命進展必經的路線。必須推行法律制度。則社會的新秩序。可以由家庭以至各種社會團體的組織中確立起來。而國家的構造。亦可由地方自治以至中央政府的組織中完成起來。必煩實行經濟建設。然後目前的人民生計問題可以解决。而新社會的經濟組織與生命。亦可隨之而發展。同時必須注重於敎育之整理。使中國民族建投國家社會所需要的各種人才之智議與技能。得以隨時代之需要而增進。革命必須從人革起。一直革到社會國家的組織和生活都完全改進了。方算成功。如果革命的內容是在於建設。則以敎育去建設人心。以經濟去建設物質的生活。以法律制度去建設政治的和社會的生命。無疑的是國民革命向前繼續進展的大道。但這種種實際的重大工作。便不能像以前軍事時期之可以偏勞革命的軍人。而是要全國國民。不問其地位能力如何。都來分擔。一致努力的。今日是民國二十年的開始。亦即是此種實際重大工作的開始。希望全國同志及國民。從今日起。大家在國民革命的進程中。努力造出一個建股的新紀元。</p>

<p>— 孫科</p>
<p>人生二十爲成年。民國誕生。迄今亦二十載。以其時考之。則亦當爲成年之期矣。過去十九年間。民國基礎。無日不在風雨飄搖之中。本黨總理爲手造民國之人。不惜歷千艱萬險。負保育維護之責。總理逝世以後。吾黨同志。亦再接再厲。秉承總理遺志。與軍閥帝國主義作殊死戰。故有十五年之興師北伐。十七年年之統一全國。以及最近之對於閻馮張桂。大張撻伐。今幸大難已去。正吾黨努力建設之秋。中央爲刷新政治整飭黨務計。乃有四中全會之召集。冀於全國黨務政治軍事建設經濟敎育等重要工作。獲得長足之進步。自四中全會閉幕以後。中央對於四中全會之重要决議案。均有尅期實現之决心。此全國民衆所殷殷屬望。而吾黨同志所引爲無限欣慰者也。</p>
<p>第以吾人觀之。中國今日苟欲刷新政治。實行建設。造成三民主義之中華民國。對於黨務之整飭。尤不能不急起直追。良以吾黨旣負﹁以黨建國﹂﹁以黨治國﹂之特殊重任。故必先於黨的組織。力求健全。黨的力量。力求充實。而後由黨發生之能力。始克任重而致遠。語云。﹁工欲善其事。必先利其器﹂國民黨者·建國治國之器也。器苟不利。又安望建國治國之工作。進行順利乎。此中央所以於四中全會之際。對於整飭黨務。不能不有重要决議也。關於黨務之决議有二。其一爲關於黨部組織案。其二爲關於黨務工作案。在黨部組織案中最主要之點。爲㈠　統一及决定指揮黨務的權力。以嚴密其組織。充實其力量。盡量避免政治機關襲用之一切形式及手續。㈡各項事務部份。應在統一的指揮之下。執行其工作。以避免因分工而成分權之局。又因分權而生人的隔閡。㈢工作人員之任作與支配。須能適應减少書面工作。注重實際工作的需要。其在黨務工作案中最主要之點。爲㈠　須深植黨的基礎於社會各種事業與組織之中。以增進人民使用四權。及發展各種社會事業之智識與能力。㈡須使黨的主義與全國各種敎育事業相融貫。以啓導全國青年男女於三民主義之途徑。須切實宣傳指導併督促地方人民。從事於地方自治之工作。以植民主政制之基礎。而在消極方面。則㈠　禁止各級黨部干涉接受或批答關於民刑訴訟事件。并不得對黨外之團體。用命令式之公文。㈡須酌量减少例行文件。以上各點。係中央察覺黨務方面所已發生之弊病。實行糾正之方案。凡屬關心黨國之　　士。莫不認爲對症之良藥也。</p>
<p>乃外間對於中央此舉。猶不免有所疑難與恐懼。以爲縮小黨部之權力。則今後工作效能。必不免因而減低。黨部經費旣須自動籌劃。不再仰給於政府。則黨費將無着落。辦黨人員之生活。亦將無法維待。同志中所以有此種疑難與恐懼者。蓋亦未嘗深思與反省之故耳。夫在辛亥以前。吾黨同志努力之方向。厥爲推翻滿清。民國成立至最近之過去工作。則在剷除軍閥。當是時也。吾黨純以在野之精神。從事破壞的革命工作。今吾黨北伐成功。統一　實現。實行以黨治國。則黨員努力之方向。亦不能不由破壞而進於建設。黨與政府之關係。旣同在一戰綫之上。自不復得以對待滿清與軍間之手段。對待國民班府。固昭昭然也。是以今後各級黨部對於政府。應剔除敵對的態度。進而爲協助的態度。不但對於政府。不應予以窒礙。且應爲政府排除一切困難。使政府各項設施。得以雷厲風行無所扞隔。而後一切應興應革之事。始易見諸實效。乃過去數年。各級黨部與政府間。每背道而馳。馴使齟齬滋多。糾紛百出。政府固受其掣肘。即黨部之作爲。亦予人民以不良之印象。今欲免除此種弊病。舍改變黨部對於政府之態度。其道莫由。此吾黨同志所應澈底反省一也。</p>
<p>其次吾黨同志。自興中會同盟會以來。努力奮鬥。垂四十載。賴總理之領導。先烈之犧牲。乃能創造民國。維持其生命。總理逝世以後。吾黨同志。益覺完成革命責任之重大。故犧牲精神。亦不能不倍進。以慰總理在天之靈。以盡後死者之責。當此之時。吾黨同志。不避艱險。不惜生命。從事革命。初無毫厘功利思想。權位觀念。存乎其間。其精神忠勇之氣。可以質之鬼神而無愧。不意統一告成。訓政開始之際。黨內因投機份子之屬入。腐惡勢力之侵襲。軍事政治。雖日有勝利。而黨務工作。反形退化之勢。不但在民衆方面。慚失其同情。即在內部。亦隱有鬆懈銹蝕之危機。其所以反不如在下野時代之虎虎有生氣者。半由於黨的範圍之驟然擴大。以致固有黨員。不能應付整個局面。半由於黨員觀念之謬誤。　精神之泛散。蓋自統一局面告成。吾黨同志。以爲本黨旣已執政。遂以取得政治地位與權力。爲個人活動之目標。對於所負之革命的使命。反忽略而不復注意。觀念旣誤。則精神亦隨而泛散。而實際負各級黨部責任之黨員。又强半爲無經騐之新手。每不能循正當途徑。爲本黨在民衆方面。深植黨的基礎。徒於形式方面。鋪張揚厲。以爲即盡辦黨之能事。甚或藉黨橫行。壟斷鄉曲。不惜舉士豪劣紳所優爲者。變本而加厲之。以致隱然造成一新特殊階級。今欲矯正此弊。必須使吾黨同志。明瞭其責任之所在。對於個人革命的修養。切實勉力。恢復革命之眞精神。剔除一切個人功利之思想。則目下一切非分舉動。均不難一舉而廓清之。此又吾黨同志所當澈底反省者二也。</p>
<p>抑有進者。十九年來中國之所以陷於風雨飄搖。實因民治基礎之脆弱。以致軍閥政客得隨時興風作浪。撼搖民國之基礎。吾人欲確立民治之根本。自不能不深植黨的基礎於社會各種事業與組織之中。爲社會民衆努力實際之工作。對於中央所　　（以下轉正張八版）</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>頒七項運動。務須切實進行。而對於民衆敎育一端。尤應加意提倡。使於最短期間。發生極大效力。同時對於社會民衆方面一切活動。均應以身作則。務引導於主義化合理化。掃除不良之惡習。使之納於革命的正軌。凡有吾黨同志所到之區即爲革命活動的塲合總理嘗言。﹁當立志做大事勿立志做大官。﹂引而伸之。則吾人不但須立志做大事。而更當立志隨時隨地爲民衆做大事。勿謂﹁我無官守我無言責﹂。不妨聽其自生自滅。不聞不問也丶此又吾黨同志所當澈底反省者三也。</p>
<p>以上三者。讀者或以爲老生常談。平淡無奇。然在今日。則吾黨同志苟不澈底反省。身體力行。則吾黨前途必將不堪設想。苟能舉以往惡習。洗滌盡凈。並能循正當途徑。志實努力於三民主義之建設。則本黨所負之使命。必能及早完成。爰乘元旦佳期略舉數端。願與本黨同志共勉之。</p>

<p>我國交通事業。處列強壓迫之下。非一日矣。而航業利權之被侵害。尤占外交痛史上最重要之一頁。迄於今茲。門戶洞開。沿海及內河航行權已完全爲英日等國所掌握外邦旗幟到處飄揚觸目傷心。誠我民族之一大恥辱。曩當通商之始。外人本限於沿海通商口岸。不得擅入內地。乃自五口通商。沿海航權。遂斷送於無形。厥後中英續約闢揚子江沿岸爲商岸。外人得以溯江深入內地。更經烟臺條約及中英續議通商行船條約之締結內河航權遂全部喪失以尽。乃列強之野心。猶以爲未足。更迫我政府。規定內港行輪章程。舉凡窮鄉僻壤之水道。亦皆供其行駛。於是我國境內航權。遂掃地而無餘。而沿海內河。槪成國際化矣。雖然。航權喪失以後若能依國家財務行政之行使。對外輪之駛入內地者。課之以稅。而盡保護本國航業之責任。尙不失爲一補救之策也。不幸所資以爲保護者。如關稅·噸稅·內地貿易稅。亦以不平等條約之故。而爲外人所操縱。航業專有。旣被刧持。航業保護。復所不許。處茲情勢之下。欲求航業之發展。自屬萬難。溯自民國成立內亂頻仍。政府以財政困難。又不能採取奬勵政策。同時以航業商缺乏企業知識業務經營亦多失策丶譬如歐戰期間。本爲振興航業之絕好機會。無如比時航商僅知注意分紅。而於航綫之擴充。船隻之添置。毫未顧及以致良機坐先。尤爲遺憾。迨歐戰告終。外輪在華之勢力復振而我國乃以軍興之故。航輪多被徵發。以是江海外輪。不但恢復戰前狀態。且變本加厲。雖軍事爲一時現象。而航商處數方夾攻之中。固已難乎爲繼。言念及此。可勝慨焉。伯羣承乏交通。目覩航業之衰敗。憂心如焚是以受命之初。即籌議改組招商局。以爲發展航業之準備。而於廢約一事。因　航業之隆替。尤不得不竭智盡能。以求貫滇。近方與外邦合商辦法。期於整個收回航權而後已。他日吾國航業復興之機。胥生乎是。</p>
<p>抑伯　有　爲國人告者。航業爲交通經濟之命脈。非賴政府與人民共同努力。不克有濟。本黨政綱關於國營事業之規定。乃以有獨占性質及私人能力不能經營者爲限。非不辨輕重。不顧民情。而任意收歸國營也。在茲經濟衰落之時。欲求本國航業之振興。自應以發展國家資本與扶植民營事業。雙方並進。方今航業幼穉已達極點丶航業勢力亦甚薄弱。政府對於國營事業。亦尙無充分之準備。正宜奬勵航商。加以相當之保護。最近四中全會决議案。已剴切言之矣。甚望全國人士一致擁護本黨巳定之方策。共國國內外航業之發展。誠如此。則不特可收回已失之航權。且將追踵英日。與外輪爭一日之短長。語云事在人爲﹂願與國人共勉之。</p>
<h3 id="c3">民國二十年元旦之新氣象 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 王正廷</p>
<p>先總理一生艱難困苦。奔走革命。卒能於辛亥之秋。產生此中華民國。屈指已二十年於茲。彷彿如少年之成人矣。回憶此過去十九年之少年民國。無日不在風雨飄搖之中。而尤以去年爲最甚。幸蔣總司令能以主義之師。戡定大亂。張副司令以擁護中央之誠。翻然南來。駐平各國公使又復聯袂來京。慶賀統一。而此少年民國當茲成年之際。遂富有一種蓬勃之新氣象。第一。全國財政統一。籌還內外債欵可有切實辦法。第二。各處鐵路均已通車。中外商業可以推行無阻。人民納稅能力當大增加。而國家之建設事業。可以次第舉行矣。惟吾人於慶祝此民國二十年元旦之際。却不能不表示一种極基本之願望。即此後國家內部永遠不發生叛亂。俾政府與人民得一致努力於最短期間取消不平等條約。以挽回國家之主權。而完成總理之遺志。夫然後此成年之民國。可以漸入於　莊大道矣。至於今後吾人進行取消不平等條約之步驟。當然以收回法權爲當務之急。顧外人中尙有鰓鰓過慮。謂一旦領判權收消。外國人即失其保護者。殊不知保護外人有吾國新制定之各種法典在此。皆係採取歐美通行之原則而成。以之適用於在華外人。固然一不順乎事理而合乎人情也。況昔日各國在華要求領判制度之初意。原以中外法律觀念之不同。今旣同矣。則吾國正可實行以吾法治吾土之通則。而外人又奚必長此越俎代庖爲哉。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Reflections That Comrades of Our Party Should Have in the Future <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Ke</p>
<p>Twenty years of life marks adulthood. The Republic of China has been born and has also existed for twenty years. Considering it in that context, this should also be the period of its adulthood. In the past nineteen years, the foundation of the Republic of China has been in constant peril. The Premier of our party, as the creator of the Republic of China, spared no effort in overcoming countless hardships and dangers, shouldering the responsibility of nurturing and safeguarding it. After the Premier's passing, comrades of our party also continued their efforts, inheriting the Premier's legacy, and engaging in a desperate struggle with warlords and imperialists. Thus, there was the Northern Expedition of the fifteenth year, the unification of the country in the seventeenth year, and the recent all-out attack on Yan, Feng, Zhang, and Gui. Now, fortunately, the great calamity has passed, and it is the time for our party to strive for construction. The Central Government, in order to rejuvenate politics and rectify party affairs, has convened the Fourth Plenary Session, hoping to achieve substantial progress in important tasks such as national party affairs, politics, military affairs, construction, economy, and education. Since the closing of the Fourth Plenary Session, the Central Government has been determined to realize the important resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session within a set period. This is what the people of the whole country eagerly expect, and what the comrades of our party find infinitely gratifying.</p>
<p>However, in our opinion, if China today wants to rejuvenate its politics, implement construction, and create a Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People, the rectification of party affairs must be urgently pursued. The reason is that our party bears the special responsibility of "building the country through the party" and "governing the country through the party." Therefore, it must first strive to improve the party's organization and enrich the party's strength. Only then can the capabilities generated by the party fulfill its heavy responsibilities and reach far. As the saying goes, "If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools." The Kuomintang is the tool for building and governing the country. If the tool is not sharp, how can we expect the work of building and governing the country to proceed smoothly? This is why the Central Government, during the Fourth Plenary Session, had to make important resolutions regarding the rectification of party affairs. There are two resolutions regarding party affairs. One is the resolution on the organization of party headquarters, and the other is the resolution on party affairs work. The most important points in the resolution on the organization of party headquarters are: 1) To unify and determine the power to direct party affairs, so as to strengthen its organization, enrich its strength, and avoid as much as possible all the forms and procedures used by political organs. 2) All functional departments should carry out their work under unified command, so as to avoid a situation where division of labor leads to division of power, and where division of power leads to interpersonal barriers. 3) The appointment and deployment of personnel must be able to adapt to the need to reduce paperwork and focus on practical work. The most important points in the resolution on party affairs work are: 1) To deeply plant the party's foundation in various social undertakings and organizations, so as to enhance the people's knowledge and ability to exercise their four powers and develop various social undertakings. 2) To integrate the party's ideology with various educational undertakings throughout the country, so as to guide young men and women throughout the country on the path of the Three Principles of the People. It is necessary to earnestly promote, guide, and urge local people to engage in local self-government work, so as to plant the foundation of a democratic political system. On the negative side: 1) Prohibit party headquarters at all levels from interfering in accepting or responding to civil and criminal litigation cases, and do not use mandatory official documents to external groups. 2) Reduce routine documents as appropriate. The above points are the Central Government's plan to detect and correct the malpractices that have already occurred in party affairs. All people who care about the party and the country believe that it is a good medicine for the right disease.</p>
<p>However, people outside the party still have doubts and fears about the Central Government's move, believing that if the power of the party headquarters is reduced, the effectiveness of future work will inevitably be reduced as a result. Since the expenses of the party headquarters must be raised on their own and no longer rely on the government, there will be no source of party fees, and the livelihood of party workers will be unsustainable. The reason why comrades have such doubts and fears is that they have not thought deeply or reflected on the matter. Before the Xinhai Revolution, the direction of the efforts of our party comrades was to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. The past work from the establishment of the Republic of China to the most recent past was to eradicate warlords. At that time, our party purely used the spirit of being in opposition to engage in destructive revolutionary work. Now that our party's Northern Expedition has succeeded, unification has been realized, and the party is governing the country, the direction of the efforts of party members must also shift from destruction to construction. The relationship between the party and the government is on the same front, so it is no longer possible to treat the National Government with the same means as treating the Qing Dynasty and the warlords. This is obvious. Therefore, in the future, party headquarters at all levels should eliminate the adversarial attitude towards the government and instead adopt an assisting attitude. Not only should they not obstruct the government, but they should also remove all difficulties for the government, so that all government facilities can be implemented vigorously and without obstruction. Only then can everything that should be promoted and reformed easily become effective. However, in the past few years, party headquarters at all levels and the government have often gone in opposite directions, leading to increasing disagreements and numerous disputes. The government has been constrained by this, and the actions of the party headquarters have also given the people a bad impression. Now, if we want to avoid this kind of malpractice, there is no way to do so except by changing the attitude of the party headquarters towards the government. This is the first thing that our party comrades should thoroughly reflect on.</p>
<p>Secondly, since the Xingzhonghui and the Tongmenghui, our party comrades have been striving hard for forty years. Thanks to the leadership of the Premier and the sacrifice of the martyrs, we were able to create the Republic of China and maintain its life. After the Premier's passing, our party comrades felt even more keenly the importance of completing the revolutionary responsibility. Therefore, the spirit of sacrifice had to be redoubled in order to comfort the Premier's spirit in heaven and fulfill the responsibility of those who came after. At that time, our party comrades did not avoid hardships and dangers, and did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives to engage in revolution. Initially, there was no thought of personal gain or power. The spirit of loyalty and courage could be vouched for by ghosts and gods without shame. Unexpectedly, when unification was achieved and political tutelage began, due to the influx of speculators and the invasion of corrupt forces, although there were daily victories in military affairs and politics, party affairs work was instead in a state of decline. Not only did we lose the sympathy of the people, but there was also a hidden crisis of relaxation and corrosion within the party. The reason why it was not as energetic as it was in the era of being out of office was partly due to the sudden expansion of the party's scope, so that the original party members could not cope with the entire situation, and partly due to the misconceptions and dispersed spirits of the party members. Since the achievement of unification, our party comrades believed that since our party had taken power, they took the acquisition of political status and power as the goal of personal activity, and neglected and no longer paid attention to the revolutionary mission they had undertaken. Since the concept was wrong, the spirit was also dispersed. The party members who were actually responsible for the party headquarters at all levels were mostly inexperienced novices, who often could not follow the proper path to deeply plant the party's foundation among the people. They only engaged in ostentation and exaggeration in form, thinking that they had done their best in running the party. Some even took advantage of the party to act recklessly and monopolize the countryside, not hesitating to transform and intensify the things that the local gentry and evil gentry were good at, so as to create a new special class in secret. Now, if we want to correct this malpractice, we must make our party comrades understand where their responsibilities lie, and earnestly strive to cultivate their personal revolutionary qualities, restore the true spirit of revolution, and eliminate all thoughts of personal gain. Then, all the improper actions at present can be easily cleared away at once. This is the second thing that our party comrades should thoroughly reflect on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reason why China has been in turmoil for nineteen years is that the foundation of democracy is weak, so that warlords and politicians can take the opportunity to stir up trouble and shake the foundation of the Republic of China. If we want to establish the foundation of democracy, we must deeply plant the party's foundation in various social undertakings and organizations, and strive to do practical work for the people of society. For the central government... (Continued on the eighth page of the main section)</p>

<p>...seven movements, we must earnestly carry them out, and we should pay special attention to promoting the education of the people, so that it will have a great effect in the shortest possible time. At the same time, we should set an example in all activities related to the people of society, and guide them towards ideology and rationalization, eliminate bad habits, and bring them into the right track of revolution. Wherever our party comrades go, it is a place for revolutionary activities. Premier Sun Yat-sen once said, "Be determined to do great things, not to be a great official." By extension, we should not only be determined to do great things, but also be determined to do great things for the people anytime and anywhere. Do not say, "I have no official position, I have no responsibility to speak," so it is okay to let it fend for itself, and not ask about it. This is the third thing that our party comrades should thoroughly reflect on.</p>
<p>The reader may think that the above three points are clichés and unremarkable. However, if our party comrades do not thoroughly reflect on them and put them into practice today, the future of our party will be unimaginable. If we can get rid of all the bad habits of the past and follow the proper path to strive for the construction of the Three Principles of the People, the mission that our party has undertaken will be completed as soon as possible. On the occasion of the New Year's Day, I would like to briefly mention a few points and share them with the comrades of our party.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Decline of China's Shipping Industry and its Remedies <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Bo</p>
<p>China's transportation industry has been under the oppression of the powers for more than a day. The infringement of shipping rights occupies the most important page in the history of diplomatic pain. Up to now, the doors are wide open, and the rights to navigate along the coast and inland rivers have been completely controlled by countries such as Britain and Japan. Foreign flags are flying everywhere, which is heartbreaking. It is a great shame for our nation. In the beginning of trade, foreigners were limited to coastal trading ports and were not allowed to enter the inland areas without authorization. However, since the opening of the five ports for trade, coastal navigation rights have been lost invisibly. Later, the supplementary treaty between China and Britain opened up the Yangtze River coast as a commercial port, and foreigners were able to go deep into the inland along the river. After the conclusion of the Treaty of Yantai and the supplementary treaty on trade and navigation between China and Britain, inland navigation rights were completely lost. However, the ambitions of the powers were still not satisfied. They forced our government to formulate regulations on the navigation of inland ports, so that the waterways in remote areas were also available for them to navigate. As a result, navigation rights within our country were swept away, and the coast and inland rivers became internationalized. However, after the loss of navigation rights, if we can exercise national financial and administrative powers, levy taxes on foreign ships entering the inland areas, and fulfill our responsibility to protect our national shipping industry, it is still a remedy. Unfortunately, the things we rely on for protection, such as tariffs, tonnage taxes, and inland trade taxes, are also manipulated by foreigners due to unequal treaties. The shipping monopoly has been hijacked, and shipping protection is not allowed. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to seek the development of the shipping industry. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, there have been frequent internal disturbances. The government has been unable to adopt incentive policies due to financial difficulties. At the same time, shipping merchants lack business knowledge and operational management is also prone to mistakes. For example, during the European War, it was a great opportunity to revitalize the shipping industry. However, the shipping merchants at that time only knew to pay attention to dividends, and did not take into account the expansion of shipping routes and the addition of ships, so that the good opportunity was missed. It is even more regrettable. By the end of the European War, the power of foreign ships in China revived, and our country was mostly requisitioned due to military campaigns. As a result, foreign ships on the rivers and seas not only recovered to the pre-war state, but also intensified. Although military affairs are a temporary phenomenon, shipping merchants are in a difficult situation surrounded by many enemies. Thinking of this, I can't help but sigh. Since I, Boqun, have been in charge of transportation, I have witnessed the decline of the shipping industry and am very worried. Therefore, at the beginning of my appointment, I planned to reorganize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as a preparation for the development of the shipping industry. For the abolition of treaties, the rise and fall of the shipping industry, I must do my best to seek completion. Recently, I have been discussing methods with foreign countries, hoping to completely recover navigation rights. The opportunity for the revival of our country's shipping industry in the future lies in this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I, Bo, have something to tell the people of the country. The shipping industry is the lifeblood of transportation and economy. It cannot be effective without the joint efforts of the government and the people. The provisions of our party's political program regarding state-owned enterprises are limited to those with a monopolistic nature and those that private individuals cannot operate. It is not to indiscriminately nationalize them regardless of the importance of the matter or the feelings of the people. At a time of economic decline, if we want to revitalize our country's shipping industry, we should advance both the development of national capital and the support of private enterprises. At present, the shipping industry is at its infancy, and the shipping industry's power is very weak. The government is not fully prepared for state-owned enterprises, so it is appropriate to encourage shipping merchants and provide them with appropriate protection. The resolution of the recent Fourth Plenary Session has already stated this clearly. I hope that the people of the whole country will unanimously support our party's established policies and jointly develop the domestic and foreign shipping industry. If this is the case, we will not only be able to recover the lost navigation rights, but also follow in the footsteps of Britain and Japan and compete with foreign ships. As the saying goes, "It is up to people to make things happen." I would like to share this with the people of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The New Atmosphere of New Year's Day in the Twentieth Year of the Republic of China <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhengting</p>
<p>The late Premier Sun Yat-sen endured hardships and difficulties throughout his life, and worked tirelessly for the revolution. Finally, in the autumn of the Xinhai Revolution, he gave birth to this Republic of China. Counting the years, it has been twenty years since then, as if a young man has grown into an adult. Recalling the past nineteen years of the young Republic of China, it has been in constant peril. Last year was the worst. Fortunately, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek was able to use the army of righteousness to quell the great chaos. Vice Commander Zhang Xueliang came south with sincerity to support the central government. The foreign envoys stationed in Beijing also came to Nanjing to celebrate the unification. The young Republic of China, at the time of its adulthood, has a vibrant new atmosphere. First, the national finances are unified, and there are practical ways to raise funds to repay domestic and foreign debts. Second, railways in various places have been opened to traffic, and domestic and foreign trade can be promoted without hindrance. The people's ability to pay taxes will greatly increase, and national construction projects can be carried out in order. However, when we celebrate the New Year's Day of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, we cannot help but express a very basic wish, that there will never be rebellions within the country in the future, so that the government and the people can work together to abolish unequal treaties in the shortest possible time, so as to restore the country's sovereignty and fulfill the Premier's legacy. Only then can the Republic of China, which has reached adulthood, gradually enter the grand path. As for the steps we will take to abolish unequal treaties in the future, the recovery of legal rights is of course the most urgent task. However, some foreigners are still overly concerned, saying that once consular jurisdiction is abolished, foreigners will lose their protection. However, they do not know that there are various new codes formulated by our country to protect foreigners. They are all based on the principles commonly used in Europe and the United States. Applying them to foreigners in China is certainly not contrary to reason and conforms to human sentiment. Moreover, the original intention of various countries to demand consular jurisdiction in China in the past was due to the different legal concepts between China and foreign countries. Now that they are the same, our country can implement the general rule of governing our land with our laws. Why do foreigners have to continue to overstep their authority?</p>

<h3 id="e5">Chairman Chiang Encourages All Division Commanders <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>To Pay Attention to the Threefold Education of Soldiers</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of Nanjing sent a telegram to all division commanders on the first day, stating, "All division commanders are aware that our revolutionary soldiers have the sacred duty of protecting the country and the people, and the creed of self-improvement. At this time of the changing of the years, we should have the ambition to move forward bravely. The previous rebellions were due to the perseverance and struggle of our comrades, which led to the success of quelling the rebellion. At this time, the bandits and communists are still growing, and if our comrades continue to work hard, we will surely achieve the effect of complete elimination. What we should pay consistent attention to in the future is to enrich our own efforts and consolidate the permanent national defense. To establish a country in today's world, those without self-defense capabilities will certainly not be able to survive. National defense is so important, but judging the capabilities of our country's current army, it is far from sufficient to talk about national defense. This is the great shame of our revolutionary soldiers, and enriching the army's capabilities is the most urgent task today. All comrades, starting from today of this year, should make a vow to work together to improve the quality of the army. First, we should lead by example, obey orders, strictly abide by discipline, diligently seek knowledge, and eliminate bad habits. Establish a model for the entire army and always maintain the faith of the people. Then, actively train, earnestly educate, and pay attention to the soldiers' physical fitness. Strengthen their muscles and bones, and do not let them be comfortable. Strictly manage their daily life, and do not let them get sick. Take care of their food and clothing, and do not let them freeze or starve. We must ensure that every soldier has a sound foundation. Secondly, pay attention to the soldiers' character. Discipline must be strict and never be relaxed. Rewards and punishments must be fair and never be lenient. In particular, we must use personality to influence them and ensure that every soldier has good character. Only then can the army achieve the goal of saving the country and the people. Thirdly, pay attention to the soldiers' knowledge. Those who are illiterate are like the deaf and blind. First, we should ensure that there is no one in the entire division who is illiterate. Those who lack scientific thinking are prone to blind actions. Secondly, we should instill in them superficial and necessary scientific knowledge. Most of the soldiers come from the fields and will eventually return to farming. It is very convenient and effective to provide them with agricultural education, and it is fundamentally beneficial to the country and society. All comrades should not be afraid of hard work and should strive to achieve this. The rigor of technical subjects and the understanding of the Three Principles of the People are even more self-evident. In the future, the evaluation of military training results must be based on the quality of the soldiers' intelligence, morality, and physical fitness, and not just on the form. The revolution has not yet succeeded, and unequal treaties have not yet been completely abolished. Our comrades can each sharpen their skills, strive forward, and persevere diligently, so that they can maintain the honor of revolutionary soldiers and be worthy of being disciples of the Premier. The lives of our countless martyrs who sacrificed their lives will not be a meaningless sacrifice. I hope that my comrades will bear in mind the importance of their responsibilities, and at this time of celebrating the new year and commemorating the founding of the country, they will decide what should be done this year, be diligent, brave, loyal, and faithful. By improving the quality of the army, we can gradually move towards consolidating national defense, which is a great blessing for the party and the country. Chiang Kai-shek East.

<p>US Department of Commerce Expresses Sympathy</p>
<p>The US Department of Commerce and other government officials in Washington declared today that there is nothing unreasonable about the increased import tariff rates announced by the Chinese government, and that trade between China and the United States will not be hindered as a result. According to the department's technicians, the increase in China's import tax on tobacco, kerosene, freight cars, and lumber is actually very small. Even the other tax rates are far less than the current US tax rates. Even taking cotton as an example, the import tax levied by China is lower than that of the United States. The United States also levies higher taxes on imported tobacco and Chinese porcelain than China levies on American goods. However, if China increases its tariffs every few years in the future, it may not be a blessing for Sino-US trade. (Reuter dispatch on the 29th)</p>

He also stressed the importance of rectifying military and disciplinary conduct. Tianjin is a place of international observation, and no officers or soldiers are allowed to go out without reason. If there is any oppression of the people or irregular actions, they will be severely punished once discovered. (31st Dispatch) Zhang of Tianjin summoned Xu Yongchang and Shang Zhen at 0:20 AM on the 31st to announce the downsizing plan for the Jin Army. The central government replied with approval.

<h3 id="e12">Predictions for This Year <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>This year is the 20th year of the Republic of China, which is also 1931 in the Western calendar. According to predictions from various countries' prognosticators, the world will face a second major war and various natural and man-made disasters. However, based on my logical deduction, this year may not enhance world peace but will maintain the status quo, leading to a moderate situation. However, domestic affairs in various countries will not be as prosperous as in the past. The union and separation between countries are not yet solidified and clear, and there is still much hesitation between their interests, and their national power is not yet sufficient.</p>
<p>As for China, it can also maintain a moderate situation. If it can proceed without unexpected obstacles, it will gradually reach a realm of prosperity. However, it depends on the wise handling by those in power. The turmoil and instability in a country are mainly due to three factors: first, enemy troops during wartime; second, organized bandits; and third, scattered bandits. Now that the enemy troops in the war have been eliminated, and the organized bandits are being suppressed with full effort, the only thing that cannot be eliminated for the time being are the scattered bandits. It will not be easy to achieve the desired result until political affairs are clear and everything is on track. Once the three factors are removed, the country will govern itself without seeking governance, and it will prosper without seeking prosperity. This is what should be strived for this year.</p>

<p>In Beiping, regarding the aftermath of Suiyuan, the central government has entrusted Zhang Xueliang to handle it. Zhang Xueliang advocates a natural progression for the Suiyuan issue. After meeting with Tang Yulin in Tianjin, the chairman of Suiyuan will be decided. The old Jin Army Zhao Chengshou's troops and the militia Wang Ying's troops have both sent representatives to Tianjin to request instructions. Wang Ying also stated that he would not accept financial or military aid from the central government, nor would he extort from the local population. He is willing to use his personal assets to support 10,000 soldiers. He believes that the troops of Song and Sun, who are scattered in the Yuanping, Diziquan, and Hetao areas, are not suitable for stationing. If necessary, he may welcome a portion of the Rehe Army to be stationed in Suiyuan. (31st Dispatch) The entire railway in Beiping is now open, and the railway bureau's income has also slightly improved. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Atmosphere Improves</p>
<p>Outline of Terms Reached a Compromise</p>
<p>Only Details Need to be Discussed in the Future</p>
<p>Geneva dispatch: The French-Italian negotiations on naval disarmament have created a good atmosphere due to the mediation of Britain and the United States and the success of the Disarmament Preparatory Committee. French representative Massigli, Italian representative Rossini, and British representative Craig are continuing to discuss in Geneva and have made considerable progress. Judging from the outline of the terms, a compromise has been reached between France and Italy. In the future, only detailed agreements need to be made. The outline is as follows: (1) Both France and Italy will maintain the status quo for "battleships" (France actually has an advantage); (2) Both countries will maintain the status quo for "aircraft per ship"; (3) "Eight-inch gun cruisers" France originally advocated 11 ships at the London Conference, but has now conceded to 7 ships after this negotiation. Italy requests that the number be principally equivalent to that of France; (4) "Six-inch cruisers and destroyers" Regarding the inclusion of ships exceeding the age limit, France actually has an advantage. There is also a tendency to compromise on this point; (5) "Submarines" Britain has a proposal of 46,700 tons for France, but France advocates 75,000 tons, while Italy advocates 52,000 tons, which is the same as Britain, the United States, and Japan. This point has not yet been resolved. (World Society)</p>

<p>Extolling the Achievements of the Cabinet Since its Formation</p>
<p>There is a Problem with the Replacement of the Speaker of the House</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 31st dispatch: The following is Prime Minister Hamaguchi's New Year's address: "I did not expect to be congratulating the New Year of Showa 6 in a room in the Tokyo Imperial University Hospital this year. The fundamental meaning of the Japanese national polity is that Japan has the imperial family of the unbroken line of succession as its center, from ancient times to the present. Therefore, the source of the spiritual and material cultural development of the Japanese people all lies in our imperial family, which goes without saying. We firmly believe that we should further elucidate the spirit of national founding, cultivate the beautiful custom of loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, and vigorously reject foreign radical ideas and the incessant trends of decline. Looking back on the one and a half months since I was attacked at Tokyo Station on November 14, I am very grateful for the great sympathy of the majority of the people during this period. Fortunately, my injuries are improving day by day, and I will soon recover my health. I am confident that I will be able to do my best for the country. We have been implementing the political program that we announced when we formed the cabinet in July of the year before last, and the realization of its effectiveness is not far away. In particular, the conclusion of the London Treaty has greatly contributed to world peace and the reduction of the national burden. From this year onwards, we should further promote the spirit of the treaty to enhance the well-being of mankind. Last January, we, on the one hand, decisively implemented the gold export ban, which had been pending for many years, and continued the austerity policy; on the other hand, we vigorously promoted industrial rationalization and encouraged the love and use of domestic products, adopting a policy of industrial and trade development. We have achieved a considerable degree of effect in restoring the financial world. However, the Japanese financial world cannot escape the deeply unfavorable situation due to the world's unfavorable conditions. However, good times do not last forever, and the same is true for bad times. This is what you all know well. The government should implement policies that adapt to the times, and at the same time, the general public must not be confused or fearful, and with a firm direction, hold a persevering spirit, and with the government and the people united, overcome this difficult situation. Now, as we welcome the spring, I would like to express my thoughts and wishes."</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 31st dispatch: The Vice-Speaker of the House of Peers, Hachisuka, will resign upon the expiration of his term on January 11th of next year. The Research Society had recommended Matsudaira Kiyoshi as his successor, and the government had also tacitly approved it. However, after Speaker Bikawa returned to the country, he considered it inappropriate for both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to come from the Tokugawa family and did not approve of it. The government understood this and decided to appoint Konoe Fumimaro as the next Deputy Speaker. However, the Research Society was dissatisfied and nominated Mitsukuchi Ito as a candidate and lobbied the government. The government said that it had decided to appoint Duke Wei and would not change its decision. Therefore, the emotions of the Research Society are very strong, and the situation is becoming increasingly turbulent.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Chiang Kai-shek's New Year Aspirations <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Two Most Important Matters for the Twentieth Year of the Republic</p>
<p>Respect Education and Encourage Agriculture</p>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the twentieth year of the Republic. As the new year begins, all compatriots nationwide must be thinking about making vigorous efforts to improve themselves daily.  I, Chiang Kai-shek, wish to present two extremely important matters to my compatriots and hope that we can all work together.  What are these two matters?  They are emphasizing education and revitalizing agriculture.  Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the guidelines for local administration for this year have been established. The focus of national effort should be on post-military affairs and the suppression of the Communists and bandits.  However, the passive reorganization of politics must be supplemented by active measures, and the work of treating symptoms must rely on the cultivation of the root cause.  I have seen that the Three People's Principles of governance require maximizing land use, human talent, resource utilization, and unhindered flow of goods.  These goals are aligned with the virtues of good governance from ancient China, such as respecting education, encouraging learning, valuing talent, training agriculture, facilitating commerce, and benefiting labor.  Therefore, nation-building must prioritize the people's livelihood, and the most urgent needs of the people's livelihood are education and sustenance.  In China today, I dare say that respecting education and encouraging agriculture are especially important.  China's industry and commerce have already achieved some initial progress in response to the natural trends of economic development.  It only requires removing restrictions and eliminating excessive interference to allow vitality to flourish and prosperity to grow daily.  The government has spared no sacrifice to abolish likin (internal customs tax) and is implementing it as scheduled.  It is also determined to realize the reorganization of finance and the promotion of investment in a gradual manner.  As for education and agriculture, they are not only preconditions for the development of all industries but also the foundation for stabilizing national order.  It is essential that all compatriots understand this and act accordingly, and then we can unite our efforts to achieve success.  I will now present these two matters to all compatriots.  First, let me speak of education.  In recent years, there has been some progress in all aspects of society in China, but education alone has not only failed to improve but has also declined daily.  The literacy rate among the people is less than 20%.  Social education is extremely lacking, let alone the education at all levels from universities to primary schools.  Very few schools can be compared to those in civilized countries in terms of facilities, teachers, and teaching achievements.  The breakdown of school discipline and the decline in educational effectiveness are unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad.  Parents have never stopped sending their children to schools, but they do not ask about the significance of educating their children.  They believe that their responsibility is complete once they have sent their children to school.  Teachers have never stopped claiming to be educators, but they do not consider their responsibilities to the nation, the people, and the students.  Most teachers treat their work as a means of earning a living and calculate their worth by the hour.  Students have never stopped progressing through the grades, but they do not want to hear about the discipline they should observe as students.  They do not care about the cultivation they should have in academics and skills.  They do not consider their responsibilities to the nation, the people, and their own future.  They only accumulate years of experience to prepare for future employment.  There are certainly some sound and sincere individuals among them, but the majority are like this: the mediocre are content with idleness, the rebellious are accustomed to disobedience, and the dissolute indulge in leisure.  Education in other countries aims to cultivate healthy citizens, but most schools in our country only cultivate vagrants, rioters, and even deficient people lacking in both mind and skill.  It is already regrettable that people in remote areas lack access to education.  Those who have the opportunity to receive education are either misguided or untrained.  Is this not a hidden concern for society and the nation?  It is already sad that students do not respect their teachers, but it is even more tragic that teachers do not strive to be respected and instead demean themselves into irresponsible knowledge vendors.  Given the lack of universal education in our country and the current state of education, how can we prevent the children of our country from being buried and sacrificed under the lack of education, becoming either victims who are easily tempted to become reactionaries or useless individuals lacking any skills?  The loss of stability in social order and the loss of foundation for all construction are all due to this.  If this continues without any attempt to remedy the situation, it not only goes against the Three People's Principles of maximizing human talent, but the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction will be imminent.  I hope that people in society will see this danger clearly and regard educating children as a serious responsibility, making the support of education and the cultivation of talent the most sacred duty to the nation, assisting the government, supervising the schools, reviving the defunct, strengthening the weak, and correcting the wrong.  The whole nation should unite and regard this as the most important task of this year. This is one.  Secondly, let me speak of agriculture.  The decline of agriculture in our country is not a recent phenomenon.  The oppression of international economic aggression, the devastation of warlord tyranny, the rampant activities of the Communist bandits, and the ignorance of farmers have all contributed to the decline of agricultural production and the impoverishment of rural areas.  This has led to a decrease in raw material exports and an increase in reliance on foreign food imports.  Those who advocate reform, seeing the trends of the world economy and the progress of agriculture, believe that emphasizing industry and commerce is necessary to establish a country in the modern world.  Others believe that it is necessary to fundamentally reform agricultural production methods, replacing small-scale manual production with large-scale mechanized farming.  However, they do not realize that the major reasons for the decline of agriculture are half due to poor methods and techniques, and half due to the farmers being affected by poor politics, leading to displacement, hardship, and inability to focus on farming.  In the past thirty years, due to the influence of international aggression and poor politics, the fact that the domestic social foundation has not completely collapsed is largely due to the fact that over 80% of farmers are still working diligently and enduring hardship.  Therefore, the fundamental plan is to strive to improve production methods, and at the same time, if we can alleviate the suffering of farmers, stabilize rural order, and actively encourage the increase of agricultural production, even if we use existing techniques and methods to engage in production, it will be enough to increase national wealth and enrich the people.  Looking at the agricultural harvests in most parts of the country last year, they were generally abundant, and within the areas of abundant harvests, bandit activity decreased sharply, refugees gradually gathered, and grain prices plummeted.  Although farmers did not gain significant benefits, the nation and society have benefited immensely.  This alone is enough to demonstrate the importance of agriculture.  What should be noted is that we cannot rely on favorable weather conditions, and we must not fail to exhaust human effort.  Even with last year's abundant harvest, it is still difficult for rural areas to recover from their exhaustion.  If there is even a slight natural disaster this year, then after the recent cessation of warfare and the incomplete suppression of bandits, the suffering will easily lead to displacement.  I believe that the majority of the people in China are farmers, and the poverty and chaos in recent years have been largely due to the fact that the central figures of society have flocked to the cities, leaving the countryside increasingly empty and the fields unattended.  There is no greater danger to the nation than this.  Therefore, the urgent task today is to have all compatriots recognize the importance of encouraging agriculture.  Parents should instruct their children, and villagers should encourage their neighbors to unite and strive to increase agricultural production.  As for suppressing bandits, establishing Baojia (household registration system), promoting agricultural cooperatives, and circulating agricultural funds, all means of stabilizing and enriching the countryside should be vigorously pursued by the government and society.  As for managing water conservancy and developing transportation, the government has already made these the top priority and will do its utmost to promote them.  In short, everyone in the country should understand China's national conditions and make promoting agriculture the most important task of this year.  This is another.  Sun Yat-sen said that the purpose of revolution is to save the country.  How can the country be saved?  It must start with saving the people.  The effect of saving the people relies on self-reliance.  Education is a long-term plan, and agriculture is entrusted with the lives of the majority.  I hope that all compatriots in the country will unite and focus on the fundamental aspects of these two matters.  I, Chiang Kai-shek, though lacking in ability, have high expectations.</p>
<h3 id="e61">19th Route Army Captures Wan'an and Taihe <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jin-yu Advances to Suppress the Kong and Li Bandits in Xiu and Tonggu</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: The 60th and 61st Divisions of the 19th Route Army are responsible for suppressing bandits on the west bank of the Gan River. After recapturing Lianhua and Yongxin on the border of Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, the 19th Route Army split into two routes, heading towards Wan'an on the east bank of the Gan River and Taihe on the west bank, hoping to cross the Gan River from Wan'an and encircle the bandits in Xingguo, and to coordinate with the Ma brigade of the 12th Division. According to a telegram from Gu'an, the Qu brigade of the 60th Division recaptured Wan'an on the 22nd and can connect with the Ma brigade. The Zhang brigade of the 61st Division occupied Taihe on the 20th, forming a unified front with the Luo, Zhang, and other divisions in Ji'an and Jishui. The bandits' fake 22nd Army have all been routed, opening up transportation on the upper reaches of the Gan River. Shipping from Ji'an to Ganzhou can be restored. The headquarters of the 19th Route Army moved from Yongxin to Wan'an on the 23rd. Wan'an is connected to Xingguo in the east, Ganzhou in the south, and borders Nankang and Suichuan on the right. It is a necessary route from the province to Ganzhou. It has recently been occupied by bandits, cutting off transportation between Ji'an and Ganzhou. Hundreds of merchant ships were detained here, unable to go up or down, and economic activity was cut off. Now it is seeing the light of day again, and travel should be unimpeded in the future. As for the Pingxiang area, it was originally an important town on the border of Jiangxi and Hunan. It is heard that Wang Jin-yu will set up a Bandit Suppression Command on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in Pingxiang, to clear the Communist bandits in Pingxiang, Wanzai, Tonggu, Xiushui, and Pingjiang, Liuyang in Hunan, and Tongcheng, Chongyang, and Tongshan in Hubei. It is understood that the bandit leaders here are Kong Hechong and Li Shixing. After capturing Xiushui, they advanced towards Wuning and Tonggu, and a small force invaded Fengxin, acting very rampantly. Hao Mengling of the 54th Division has already dispatched a brigade from Fengxin to Xiushui, and sent a part from Jiujiang to reinforce Wuning, hoping to cooperate with Wang Jin-yu's troops, advancing north along the border of Jiangxi and Hunan towards the border of Hubei, and annihilating the Li and Kong bandits.

<h3 id="e62">Large Number of Communists Executed in Wuhan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Fifteen Men and Women Including Su Limin</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: The Wuhan Garrison Command, because Wuhan is located in a strategic location and many Communist bandits are hiding there, specially dispatched dedicated personnel to investigate and arrest them day and night. In recent months, it has cracked down on about a dozen secret Communist organizations and arrested over a hundred important Communist members. Recently, it cracked down on another Communist organization. The leaders Su Limin and others were responsible as members of the Communist Yangtze River Committee, presiding over the joint uprisings in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Henan. After strict interrogation by the Garrison Command, all the uprising plans were revealed, and on the 27th, Su Limin and 14 others were brought out and executed by firing squad. The charges are recorded as follows: 1) According to the Investigation Department of this Command, nine important Communist criminals, Su Limin, Yuan Bingzhang, Yuan Shuren, Zhang Xiaoqing, Yi Shuya, Li Guanghui, Yang Zhisiao, Hu Yunqing, and Deng Congxin, were arrested, and many reactionary declarations and plan drafts were seized. They were all sent to the Command for interrogation. After opening the court and conducting detailed interrogation, Su Limin confessed that he was formerly the secretary of the Fujian Communist Provincial Committee and was recently transferred by the Central Committee to serve as a member and secretary-general of the Yangtze River Bureau. He presided over many of the reactionary plans in the five provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Henan. Yuan Bingzhang confessed that he was formerly the secretary of the Hunan Communist Provincial Committee and was transferred this year to serve on the Sichuan Provincial Military Committee. He came to Wuhan recently to attend the preparatory meeting for organizing the joint uprising of the five provinces and discuss the implementation methods. Yuan Shuren confessed that he was formerly a cadre of the Organization Department of the Communist Central Committee and served concurrently in the Military Work of the Military and Political Action Committee. Recently, due to the destruction of the Wuhan Communist organization, he was ordered to come to Wuhan to plan to restore the organization and rigorously implement armed uprisings. Zhang Xiaoqing and Yi Shuya jointly confessed that they were ordered by the Yangtze River Bureau to become husband and wife and establish a reception organization specifically to accommodate party members participating in the uprising. Li Guanghui and Yang Zhiqing jointly confessed that they both served as technical secretaries of the Yangtze River Bureau and were ordered to establish a printing organization, jointly responsible for mimeographing. Hu Yunqing confessed that he was responsible for the transportation work of the Yangtze River Bureau and was ordered to cooperate with Deng Congxin and others of the Hanchuan County Committee to establish a transportation organization. The above confessions are not denied. Recently, the Communist organizations in Wuhan have been thoroughly investigated and cracked down on by this Command. The local areas have been cleaned up, and the clearing can be seen day by day. However, the criminals still dared to establish organizations, recruit bandit leaders, plan to restore organizations, and vainly attempt to expand the uprising. They were truly incorrigible and reckless. They should all be sentenced to death according to the law to show a clear warning. In addition to signing and submitting the criminals, verifying their identities, and binding them to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad, a public announcement is hereby issued to make it known to all. 2) According to the Third Regiment of the Central Gendarmerie, a Communist criminal Xu Yunping, who was found to be carrying reactionary publications, was handed over to this Command. After opening the court and repeatedly studying the case, and after self-confessed persons testified in court, it was confirmed that the criminal had joined the Communist Party and served in the Wuchang District Committee and in various important positions in the Hankou Municipal Committee after attending a Communist meeting in Shanghai. In this way, the criminal is an important member of the Communist Party and performs important duties. His crime is heinous and cannot be tolerated by the law. He should be sentenced to death in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Law on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries to show a clear warning. In addition to signing and submitting the criminal, verifying his identity, and binding him to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad, a public announcement is hereby issued to make it known to all. 3) According to the Investigation Department of this Command, two Communist bandits, Yu Fengqi and Fu Hanzhang, were arrested and handed over to this Command. After repeated investigation, the bandit Yu Fengqi confessed that he joined the Communist Party, mobilized peasants, established rural groups, and was responsible as the group leader, preparing for armed uprisings. Fu Hanzhang confessed that he joined the Communist Party, served in the Jiang'an District organization work, mobilized peasants to establish rural groups, gathered fugitive vagrants, prepared for armed uprisings to respond to the Red Army, and received 15 yuan in living expenses from the Communist Party. The confessions are straightforward and undeniable. In this way, they joined the Communist Party, performed important duties, and intended to carry out armed uprisings. The circumstances are serious and cannot be tolerated by the law. They should be sentenced to death in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Law on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries. In addition to verifying their identities and binding them to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad, a public announcement is hereby issued to make it known to all. 4) According to the Investigation Department of this Command, three Communist criminals, Xiong Wei, Lu Jia, and Liu Gengqi, were arrested and submitted to this Command for interrogation according to the law. After opening the court for interrogation and having the confessed persons testify in court, it was confirmed that Tai Wei joined the Communist Party, served as the secretary of the Soldiers' Committee, and received funds. He established a military transport organization in Qianjia Street, Nanhu, to receive Communist soldiers. Lu Jia previously served in the Ye He bandit army, participated in the Haifeng and Lufeng uprisings in Guangdong, and carried out burning and killing indiscriminately. This time, he secretly came to Wuhan to take charge of military transport work in Wuchang. Liu Gengqi previously served as a private in the Nanjing Gendarmerie and planned an uprising. He was once wanted but not captured. Recently, he secretly came to Wuhan from Shanghai and cooperated with Xiong Wei and Lu Jia, intending to incite the National Army and carry out an uprising. All of the above facts are confirmed. The crimes are serious and cannot be excused. In addition to signing and submitting the criminals, verifying their identities, and binding them to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad, a public announcement is hereby issued to make it known to all.

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3 id="e63">Wang Jin-yu Takes Office <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>as the Commissioner of Bandit Suppression and Rural Pacification in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: During his recent tour from Nanjing to Hubei, Generalissimo Chiang has formulated concrete plans for the bandits and Communists in the three provinces, dividing the areas for pacification and setting a deadline for complete suppression. He has also appointed Wang Jin-yu, the commander of the Ninth Army, as the Commissioner of Bandit Suppression and Rural Pacification in the border areas of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and all commanders of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts will be under his command for specific responsibilities. After receiving the order, Wang Jin-yu, considering the urgent nature of military affairs, took office first in Hankou on the 26th. The Commissioner's Office was originally located in Pingxiang, but Wang Jin-yu, after considering the situation, decided to temporarily set it up in Hankou and has telegraphed Generalissimo Chiang on the 27th to request instructions. Once approved, he will organize and establish it immediately. The Wuhan Headquarters, to ensure thoroughness in suppressing bandits in the three provinces simultaneously and to prevent them from fleeing and rising up, has formulated joint defense measures for the three provinces and appointed Liu Jianxu, the commander of the Tenth Army, as the director of the joint defense zone of the three provinces to oversee everything. The counties planned to be included in the joint defense zone are Changsha, Pingjiang, Liuyang, Liling, Xiangxiang, and Baling in Hunan; Chongyang and Tongshan in Hubei; and Pingxiang, Wanzai, Xiushui, and Tonggu in Jiangxi, totaling twelve counties. The joint defense can be implemented within about a week. As for the bandit situation in the three provinces, apart from Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, where they have been actively suppressed and suffered huge losses, and no longer have the ability to fight, great progress has also been made in Hubei province in recent days. For example, Songzi, Shishou, and Gong'an counties have been successively recaptured by Chen Cheng and Li Jue's troops, and Tongcheng, which was recently captured by the bandits, has also been recaptured by Zhou Xiwu's brigade of Tao Guang's unit. The remnants of the Huang'an bandits have also been wiped out by Su Zhichu's unit. The commanders of the Tao and Xiao divisions both telegraphed the Wuhan Headquarters on the 26th to report their victory. (December 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Circumstances of Li Yong'an's Troops Surrendering Their Weapons <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The 52nd Division Was Ordered to Execute the Task</p>
<p>Li and His Troops Were Disarmed and Awaited Orders in Xu</p>
<p>Xu Prefecture Dispatch: The 52nd Division, under Han Deqin, was ordered to resolve the matter of Li Yong'an's independent brigade of the 8th Army, stationed in Xiao County. From the morning of December 26th to noon on the 28th, the entire situation was resolved. The circumstances are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Disarmament Outside the City: On the morning of the 26th, Zhang Zhong, commander of the 154th Brigade of the Han Division, led the first regiment from Sanbao on the Jinpu Railway to the south of Xiao County. The third regiment marched from Yanglou on the Longhai Railway to the west of Xiao County. At dawn, the third regiment of Li's troops, under Lu Chongmin, was stationed in Meicun Wanzhuang, southwest of the city. The second regiment, partially led by Li Zijiang, was stationed in Duanyuan, northwest of the city, and Huatan Temple, south of the city. All were asleep. The first regiment of the Han Division launched a sudden attack on Meicun Wanzhuang, immediately resolving the entire Lu regiment and capturing Commander Lu Chongmin. The third regiment of the Han Division simultaneously resolved the Li troops in Duanyuan and Huatan Temple. Only a few troops escaped into the city amidst the chaos. As soon as it dawned, the escaped troops closed the city gates and defended the city. Brigade Commander Zhang counted over two hundred guns and captured four to five hundred men outside the city. He immediately ordered his troops to surround the city and fired machine guns at Li's troops on the city walls. He also had the division's orders delivered through the cracks in the city gate, ordering them to surrender immediately.</p>
<p>Surrounding the City and Negotiations: The people of Xiao County, suddenly hearing gunfire in their sleep, were unaware of the situation. County Magistrate Gan Gongyu sent personnel to inquire with Li's brigade headquarters. Lu Senxuan, Li's chief of staff, informed them that the 52nd Division had surrounded Xiao, fearing it was for disarmament. Upon receiving this news, Gan immediately ordered the police brigade to concentrate for self-defense at the county government, the police station, and the two watchtowers on the north and south streets. At the same time, he ordered Yang Jingzhi, head of the Public Security Bureau, to gather police for protection. The Xiao police force had three hundred guns, led by Captain Ma Ziliang. Fortunately, they were all in the city. They also constructed fortifications in front of the county government, stacking stones into walls, to prepare for any action by Li's brigade. They then inquired with the 52nd Division headquarters via long-distance telephone and reported the situation for instructions. At noon, Han Deqin personally led troops to Xiao, spoke with Wang via telephone, and delivered official documents over the city walls, ordering Wang to lead the local self-defense forces to seize the East Gate and meet the advancing army. Wang sent Wang Yuzhang, head of the General Affairs Section, and Shi Zhanru, representative of the Finance and Property Department, out of the city on ropes, raised a white flag on the city wall, and requested a temporary cessation of the attack. At the same time, he sent representatives Li Gongda, Zhang Penglai, Yin Gengye, Niu Lin, etc., to Li's brigade headquarters to negotiate with Li Yong'an, asking him to surrender his weapons and guaranteeing no further problems. After several twists and turns, by noon on the 27th, Li sent his mother, his four wives, and the families of his officers out as hostages. The Han Division then withdrew and retreated. Han ordered Li's troops to leave the city and surrender their weapons in Duanyuan. Li's troops hesitated. That evening, Han increased the encirclement again. Wang then sent people to spread news in all directions to shake the morale of Li's troops. Soldiers of Li's troops secretly surrendered to the county government, and Wang kept them in separate rooms. Li's confidants checked the troops in the city and found that their numbers were gradually decreasing. Realizing that he had no power and no way to escape, he convened a meeting of his officers that evening and decided to comply with the order to surrender their weapons. Thus, at dawn on the 28th, they surrendered their weapons to the county government. Those who had disarmed went to Duanyuan, west of the city, to assemble. Before disarming, Li sent Wang an orchid score, requesting an oath of brotherhood. Wang replied that there was no danger. Li then stayed at the county government. At this time, the Han Division had entered the city and sent troops to monitor Li. His senior officers and confidants were also monitored at the county government. The four gates were then opened. The county government collected about three hundred guns of various sizes, and Li's brigade headquarters also surrendered some guns. Han entered the city in the forenoon with county government representatives Wang Yuzhang and Wang Zhanru. The city's markets had been closed for three days and gradually resumed business.</p>
<p>Local Aftermath: During the siege and attack, the Han Division used machine guns and mortars to suppress Li's troops. Over ten shells landed in the city, one in the Public Security Bureau's office, one in the Normal School, two in the Education Bureau, two in front of the County Party Department, and two at the West Gate, killing three people: Hu Xuezhi, Hu the Lame, and a Jia surname youtiao seller. Over ten houses were destroyed. A shell landed outside the West Gate, igniting a fire and burning three or four thatched houses. Other buildings, such as the Farmers' Education Center, suffered slight damage, but there was no major harm. County Magistrate Wang Gongyu is currently working with local circles to handle the aftermath. Han Deqin yesterday appointed Battalion Commander He Dake as the city defense commander, responsible for maintaining治安. Brigade Commander Zhang Zhongfu returned to Xu yesterday with Han and went to Xiao this morning to oversee the aftermath and bring the detained Li brigade officers to Xu for telegraphic presentation to Chairman Chiang and Commander-in-Chief Liu for review and processing. Xiao City is still under strict guard, but the locality has returned to normal.</p>
<p>Li's Conversation: The reporter had a brief conversation with Li at the Xiao County Government. Li appeared to be about thirty years old, dressed in plain clothes, a long robe, a leather cap, and a cloak. He was smoking opium and seemed quite straightforward. He said that his unit was placed under the command of the 2nd Army Corps Commander Liu Zhi last winter and commissioned as the temporarily compiled 2nd Brigade Commander. This summer, when the Western Route War started, it was changed to the command of the 8th Army as an independent brigade. After the war, it was stationed in Bozhou. It was only moved to Xiao County on the 16th of this month. He did not know that he was transferred here for disarmament. He had always obeyed orders, so he had no intention of resisting this time, and so on. Li's Chief of Staff, Lu Senxuan, was also present at the time. His right ear was missing. At the moment, Li, Lu, and his regimental commanders Li Zelin, Lu Chongmin, Secretary Tao Pinshan, Adjutant Zhu Zhizhong, Deputy Regimental Commander Yin Shanmin, Battalion Commander Li Lanqing, Li Keyong, followers Chen Yougong, Hu Kunyi, Jia Chengen, Li Kezhong, Li Kebin, Li Kexing, Yang Wentian, etc., were all escorted to Xu by car. According to investigation, Li's brigade had a total of three regiments and four special service companies. Li was the brigade commander and concurrently the commander of the second regiment. The first regiment commander was Li Zelin, and the second regiment commander was Lu Chongmin. The total strength was 3,300 men, but the actual number was less.

<h3 id="e65">The Tragedy of Burning Narcotics in Jinan <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Explosives Were Mixed into the Burning Narcotics</p>
<p>One Person Died on the Spot, More Than Ten Were Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: This morning (29th) at 9:00 AM, the Jinan Municipal Government burned opium, smoking paraphernalia, heroin, and other narcotics in front of the city hall. The fire brigade first poured the narcotics into a pit, sprinkled them with several barrels of kerosene, and then ignited them. About ten minutes after ignition (around 10:00 AM), there was a sudden explosion. The sound of the explosion was heard throughout the city. At the time, government officials and spectators scattered and fled, and order was thrown into chaos. About twenty minutes later, personnel from the municipal government and the Public Security Bureau went forward to inspect the scene. Liu Xishan, a policeman from the fire brigade, was killed on the spot by the explosion. Others who were injured included Liu Zizhan, Secretary of the Provincial Government; Yang Shisheng, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Municipal Government; Qian Zhuo, Director of the Document Section; Tu Zhizhang, clerk of the Business Section; Li Shutong, clerk; Ma Zedong, Director of the Administrative Section; Secretary Ni Dewei; and fire brigade policemen Lian Shouchang, Fei Fuchang, Chen Junsheng, Han Qinfang, and Wang Rongfu (severely injured). The seriously injured were immediately taken to Jinan Hospital for emergency treatment. The cause of the explosion was that there was an iron box in the narcotics. Prior inspection was not done before burning. It contained yellow-wrapped explosives, said to have been left behind by the retreating Jin army. Because its color was similar to the narcotics, it was included in the narcotics and burned together, resulting in this unexpected tragedy. It is reported that Ma Zedong, the Chief of the Administrative Section of the Municipal Government, was seriously injured and may be in critical condition. The killed policeman, Liu Xishan, was from Dong'e and lived in Jinan. He left behind an old mother and a young sister. His mother and sister are currently wailing and preparing the body for burial. The municipal government's relief measures are currently being discussed. (29th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">A Record of Visiting Ancient Relics in Tan City <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Ancient Site Research Association, jointly formed by the Academia Sinica and the Shandong Provincial Government, excavated the old Tan State city of Chengzhiya, Longshan Town, east of Jinan City, and obtained a large number of ancient relics. After stopping the excavation, for several weeks of sorting work, each ancient object was washed with water, and the broken ones were glued together. The ancient objects were specially displayed and an exhibition was opened, scheduled for January 1st and 2nd. The arrangements have now been completed. I visited the exhibition yesterday and recorded the general situation as follows:</p>
<p>Overview of the Exhibition Room: The address of the exhibition is the Engineering College of Qingdao University, in the office of the Ancient Site Research Association in the north house of the third courtyard (i.e., the physics laboratory of the former Industrial School). There are three rooms, and each ancient object is classified and displayed. Generally, the middle room contains various charts, the east room contains cultures before the Tan State, mostly stone tools and bone tools, and the west room contains Tan State culture and other ancient objects, such as pottery and bricks.</p>
<p>General Situation of Ancient Object Arrangement: In the east room, there are stone axes, stone knives, and stone hammers on the south table, some thick and blunt, some thin and sharp, which are thought to have gradually evolved. There is a piece of white jade, as big as an inkstone, round on the upper side and square on the bottom side. There is a small hole, which may be used for wearing. It has been determined to be a thing from before the Han Dynasty. Among the coins, there is half of a Qi knife, with raised lines on it, which is quite fine. There are quite a few bone-made utensils, such as needles, awls, and hairpins, all of which are placed in glass boxes. There is a cow scapula, which is an ancient divination tool, with dense traces of fire burning. The round holes are spotted and impermeable. The ancients looked at the shape of the cracked lines to predict good and bad luck. There are also many bones that have not been manufactured. There are horn utensils on the east table, mostly deer antlers made into sharp shapes, used as weapons. The clam shells have very fine serrations, and there are also several large clam shells that can be a foot in diameter, as well as snail shells, the small ends of which have been removed, which proves that ancient</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>people also liked this thing very much. There are black pottery on the north table, all of which have been pieced together from fragments with glue. One or two objects can be as much as 80% intact. There are even more thin fragments, all placed in boxes. From here, one enters the middle room. On the wall is an imaginary map of Tan City, made square, 450 meters long and wide. There are also seven pieces of Tan City, with the rammed earth marks clearly visible. There are also stove ashes, made of chopped wheat straw mixed with soil, just like today's method. The traces of wheat straw are still identifiable. From here, one enters the west room. On the west table are white pottery, a three-legged Jia missing one foot. The gray pottery is mostly Dou and Li. There is a Ding that is quite complete. On the south table, there is a gray pottery, like a bell shape upside down on the ground, hollow, with two circular sections. The lower section has a slightly larger factory mouth, and the upper section is a small bowl, covered on the lower section, small and extremely unique. Its name is not known. On the south table are ancient relics from the vicinity of Linzi, the capital of Qi, and the Qi King's tomb, bricks and tiles, bones, etc., and there are also ancient relics from the ancient Pinglu City, three miles east of Tan City, also mostly bricks and tiles, etc. There are even objects from Tang Dynasty tombs in Tan City, two magnetic bottles, shaped like piggy banks, several green silks, very shiny, filled with rice, which has rotted, and a hat, the inside being cloth and the outside resembling leather, and a leather belt, with a copper buckle, which is very similar to today's. There are also various arrowheads, copper, stone, clam, bone, and pottery. On the middle table are pottery with colorful art, with patterns on them, and characters like "ten mountains and rivers," etc., which have not yet been identified as what characters they are. There are many mud balls, like the iron balls used for sports today, which were found five meters in the soil. It is not known what they are.</p>
<p>The Most Precious Ancient Relics: Among the ancient relics of Tan City culture and pre-Tan culture, there are those from 3,000 years ago, which have made significant contributions to archeology. Among them, pottery and arrowheads were discovered for the first time. Furthermore, the black pottery is of a strange and ancient style, black and shiny, which archeologists have never seen before, and is also one of the important right-hand tools after the excavation of the Yin Ruins. Furthermore, the clam saw is extremely sharp and has never been seen before. The cow scapula divination tool is certainly a Shang Dynasty item, contemporaneous with turtle shell divination, all of which are extremely important discoveries. (</p>

<h3 id="e67">Gong Debai Requests the Abolition of Private Tolls in Western Hunan <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Gong Debai's letter to Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, stated: Your department is keen to abolish likin, eliminating this decades-long abusive policy. All Chinese people cannot but rejoice. I am originally from Western Hunan and know that the corner of Western Hunan has long been a land beyond the pale. Not only is it beyond the reach of central authority, but even the Hunan provincial government has no means to reach it. In the past, there were two warlords in Western Hunan, Chen Quzhen and Chen Hanzhang, each levying taxes and extorting money in their defense areas. The people were under the weight of oppression and had long dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Even if they did, the government would not hear it. Last year, Chen Hanzhang was assassinated and his troops disintegrated, but his defense area had been occupied by others. Currently, the only warlord who continues to do evil is Chen Quzhen. Chen's fixed defense area includes Yuanling, Luxi, Qiancheng, Fenghuang, Yongshui, Mayang, Guzhang, Yongshun, Baojing, Longshan, Sangzhi, and other counties, spanning the You River and Wu River basins (both tributaries of the Yuan River). Except for Yuanling County, which has more convenient transportation and the provincial government's eyes and ears are more attentive, Chen Quzhen does not dare to arbitrarily set up customs to levy taxes. However, from Yuanling to the north, tracing the You River from Luxi and westward, tracing the Wu River, there are customs every few miles or dozens of miles. The tax levied at each customs is heavier than the national tax. For goods with a likin of one yuan, the tax levied by Chen Quzhen's privately established customs is also around one yuan when transported to the destination. Such shocking things are not only unknown to the central government, but the Hunan provincial government is also deaf to them. Even if they hear about it, they cannot do anything about it. Now that likin has been completely abolished nationwide, these privately established customs should also be abolished. However, the effect of your department's circular can only extend to areas within the reach of the Hunan provincial government's authority, and it is extremely difficult to have any effect on these special areas under the iron heel of warlords. I urge you to convey this to Minister Song and send a strict telegram to the Hunan provincial government, ordering Chen Quzhen to abolish all these privately established customs. If he dares to disobey, please punish him severely. Only in this way can the corner of Western Hunan have the hope of seeing the light of day again. I respectfully offer nine bows on behalf of the people of Western Hunan to thank you.</p>

<p>Yu Tang Township Opens a Horticultural Specialty School: Minister Niu of the Ministry of Personnel, in order to promote agriculture and cooperate with the existing agricultural talents in Jiangsu Province, has specially opened a horticultural experimental field and a horticultural specialty school in Yu Tang Township, Shanghai. Technical personnel will be employed from the friends of Suzhou schools, and Liao Jianan (from Suzhou Agricultural School) will be invited to serve as principal to take charge of planning everything. It is scheduled to start on February 1st, 2020.</p>
<p>The General Situation of Suzhou's Banking Industry in 2019: Suzhou's banking industry has always had better profits than other industries at the end of each year's settlement. However, this year there is a significant downturn. The biggest reasons are: 1) Affected by the bankruptcy of peers in Yangzhou, Huzhou, and rice shops in the four rural areas, the losses amounted to 700,000 yuan, and all large and small peers were spared, especially the Qian Dazhuang, Sheng Da, in Guanqian, suffered the most. 2) Businesses in various industries are sluggish and the demand for funds is limited. On the one hand, due to competition among peers, most of the loans are with very low interest rates. At the end of the lunar year, due to the slow settlement, although the profit and loss cannot be determined yet, judging from the labor, even if there is a surplus, it is minimal. Many will offset profits and losses. Ruo Yuan is reported to be closing accounts next year, and there is also talk of Sheng Da closing accounts. In terms of new stores, it is heard that two small money shops have been opened, one named Hong Kang, with shareholders surnamed Guan and Xu, with a capital of 20,000 yuan. The manager is Bian from Shenghe. One is named Zhihe, with shareholders surnamed Zhang from Nanxiang, with a capital of 10,000 yuan. The manager is Li, formerly from Shengchang. The address is approximately in the eastern downtown area.</p>

<p>Fa Du Town Robbed: The town of Sudu Pqiaotou, a few miles away from the city outside the Dadongmen of Fa Du Town, was suddenly attacked by a large gang of bandits at noon on the 23rd of this month. They first went to the Public Security Branch to rob guns and ammunition, and then surrounded the whole town, searching every household, none spared. At that time, the town chief, Yang, was working in the rural threshing floor and was notified by Cao, the principal of a certain elementary school in the town, and was able to avoid it. However, the bandits learned about the situation and shot and killed Cao. At the same time, a certain Jia was also shot and killed. About four or five people were injured. The total loss is estimated to be over 30,000 yuan. It is now heard that a certain Jia from the security regiment has contacted a certain group leader in the Huangjin Mountains and has some clues. Three bandits have been captured.</p>
<p>The Danger of Night Navigation in Tanben: Jintan's transportation is notoriously inconvenient. Usually, the traffic relies on Shaoxing-style fast boats to Benniu Town, connecting with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line (it is relatively convenient to pass small wheels in summer due to the rising water). Because the villages and towns passed through are mostly in the territory of Danyang County, where Yuqiao Town is a central point that must be passed through for navigation. There have been incidents of robbery of express boats and travelers when they are more than ten miles away from the town. It is said that this has happened three times this year, especially when passing through the area in the dark.</p>

<p>The sixth State Council meeting of the Executive Yuan resolved to appoint Qian Yongming as the Minister to France, as seen in yesterday's newspaper.

<h3 id="e79">Local Autonomy Training Institute <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government specially established a local autonomy training institute to train local autonomy personnel. The first batch of students in the institute, a total of 160 in the special class and 80 in the ordinary class, began classes on the 15th of this month and held a supplementary opening ceremony at 9:00 AM yesterday. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Participants: Zhang, the mayor, Yu, the director, You Bolu, the head of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Huang Daolin, the head of the Judicial Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Tang Naikang, the head of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Zhou Yongneng, the member of the Municipal Construction Discussion Committee, Su Xianyang, the salt transport envoy of Liangzhe, Wu Guangzong, the director of the Hydrographic Survey Bureau, Sun Baorong, the municipal government advisor, Zhang Taiji, the representative of the Garrison Headquarters, Wang Binyan, the organizing member of the Municipal Civil Defense Corps, Xu Peihuang, the head of the Education Bureau, Cen Dezhang, the secretary of the municipal government, Yao Yuanding, the representative of the local court, Ye Mujiu, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' office in Shanghai, and more than 300 students. The ceremony was presided over by Yu Hongjun, the director of the institute. Order of Ceremony: 1. Stand at attention. 2. Play music. 3. Sing the Party anthem. 4. Bow three times to the Party, the national flag, and the portrait of the President. 5. The chairman respectfully reads the President's will. 6. The mayor gives a speech. 7. Speech. 8. The director of the institute responds. 9. Play music. 10. Ceremony is completed. 11. Photograph. 12. Refreshments.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Speech: This year, after the Central Legislative Yuan enacted the Municipal Organization Law in May, there was a basis for handling local autonomy. The city then established a district planning committee and a preparatory committee for the local autonomy training institute. The city has many talents, but it is not easy to carry out all local undertakings because they do not understand the special circumstances of the locality or the municipal government's administrative program. The establishment of this local autonomy training institute is therefore urgent. During the preparatory period of the institute, the qualifications and examinations of the students were carefully considered. "Students in the special class do not have to come to the institute due to economic limitations, but they can also receive the same training." Today, we have the opportunity to gather together to receive local autonomy training. How fortunate is this? If we can concentrate on studying what we have learned, we will be able to be competent and happy in serving the society in the future. There is also an incidental statement that students here do not need to ask whether they will have work after graduating in three months, but they should ask whether they have gained any insights during the study period. If they have excellent graduation results, they will not have to worry about society not welcoming them. I would like to briefly describe the essentials of training. The President's teachings show us that local autonomy is the foundation for implementing constitutional government. As for local politics in other countries, Germany is known for government rule, and the United Kingdom and the United States are known for civil rule, but each has its advantages and disadvantages. Our country had already handled local autonomy during the late Qing Dynasty, but the reason why it was not successful was that the handlers did not have appropriate methods, and scholars regarded it as a shortcut to becoming an official, which led to this. The so-called "training" is to use the foreknowledge to enlighten the latter, and the first knowledge to enlighten the latter knowledge, in order to cultivate the people's ability to use the four powers and increase the people's interest in participating in politics. The students here today are trained, and they will train people in the future, so they must pay special attention to their character and learning, cultivate their character and study hard, and prepare for the future. At the same time, it is especially important to pay attention to the word "practice." The ancients had the saying of practicing the heart, practicing the courage, and practicing the Qi. In short, the students' physical and mental training is very important. It is hoped that they will deeply understand and practice it.</p>
<p>Zhou Yongneng's speech: It is very pleasant to participate in the ceremony today. I heard that the teachers in this institute are all selected for a while. The results three months later will satisfy the students' wishes. It can be predicted that the Chinese Kuomintang wants to put the national politics on track, and the implementation of local autonomy is its first step. Such as population, land, transportation, roads, etc., are all local autonomy undertakings. Shanghai has achieved such results in a difficult environment of construction, which is not easy. New York in the United States has 400 million gold every year to manage municipal administration, and Chicago also has 300 million gold. How can it be as good as their achievements? If we want to do this immediately, it is of course impossible, but we can also plan at any time, the so-called first seek to have it, and then seek to be good. Only when the government's administration has measures, can the people assist. Judging from the spiritual aspect, for example, the government's investigation of the household registration is often not easy to obtain accurate answers. The fault is not entirely that the municipal government is not doing its job well, but that the people are not able to assist. Therefore, the people should always cooperate with the government, so that trouble can be avoided. You are here to study local autonomy, fortunately do not regard it as a thing of little importance. In addition to joy, I offer this tribute.</p>
<p>Director Yu's Response: It is an honor to receive Mayor Zhang's speech, Mr. Zhou Yongneng, the Construction Discussion Committee, and the presence of the guests today. I am very happy. This seat is under the command of the mayor, and is based on the central regulations, the municipal government's laws and regulations, and is in charge of the mayor's administration. Not only in this solemn ceremony, I am deeply frightened. Fortunately, you understand. Tracing back to the preparatory period of the institute, Mr. Huang Yisheng and Chen Dezheng have given a lot of support, especially Section Chief Huang's support for the most time. Mr. Ma Chong has planned in detail for teaching affairs. Mr. Chen Kecheng is cautious about moral education. Mr. Zhu Weikong has handled affairs properly. The spirit of the efforts of other colleagues has been very uplifting not long after the start of school. This can be gratifying to the mayor and guests. As for the future direction of the institute, in short, it is to cultivate the spirit of personal autonomy and cultivate the knowledge of personal autonomy in order to achieve the goal of local autonomy. In other words, to cultivate the spirit that individuals should have for autonomy, and to cultivate the knowledge that individuals should have for autonomy in order to achieve the ultimate goal of local autonomy. Now the unit of the national organization is the people. However, many people inevitably have excessive actions, that is, because they do not have sufficient knowledge. If individuals cannot be autonomous, society will not be on track, and the country will have no hope of perfection. Now the students have gathered here together to study, and I think they have already felt the importance of local autonomy. Therefore, on the one hand, I deeply hope to encourage each other, and on the other hand, I hope that the guests present will not hesitate to give guidance at any time to help me make up for my shortcomings.</p>

<p>Mu Ouchu Came to Shanghai to Negotiate Progress</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Pacification and Rehabilitation Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: "We are writing to inform you that our colleagues believe that the farmers in Jiangsu Province have suffered from bandits for many years and are displaced. Now that the National Government has appointed Mr. Zhang Zhijiang as the pacification governor of this province to engage in bandit suppression, the scourge of the negative aspect will be wiped out. The work of the positive aspect should be borne by the people of Jiangsu to make facilities for pacification and rehabilitation. Therefore, our association was organized, hoping to do our best to save the people of Jiangsu from their plight. Shanghai is a major industrial and commercial port in China, and a branch should be organized urgently to assist in the progress. We have sent Mr. Mu Ouchu, a member of the preparatory committee of our association, to Shanghai to consult with the gentlemen of your association to make progress. We hope that you will give your full support so that we can see its success as soon as possible. Thank you."</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Decline of Shanghai's Shipping Industry Last Year <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Most Chinese and Foreign Companies Suffered Losses</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Suddenly Greatly Improved</p>
<p>This year, gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and the import and export industry is the most depressed. The shipping industry has been affected by the war, the high price of hardware, the obstruction of transportation, and the decline in freight volume, which is worse than other industries. Almost all Chinese and foreign shipping companies on various rivers and seas in Shanghai this year have suffered heavy losses. Time flies, and another year has passed. The business conditions of various shipping companies in Shanghai are checked and reported as follows:</p>
<p>Taikoo Company: The British Taikoo Company has the most ships, and its routes cover the entire China, ranking first among the six companies. It has a total of 73 ships with a total of 163,000 tons. This year, the Yangtze River route was blocked due to the interruption of the Pinghan traffic and the disturbance of the Xiang-E bandits and communists. There were few imports and exports. The Sichuan River route was also caused by excessive competition and the indiscriminate drop in water feet. Although two new ships, Wuhu and Wuxue, were added to the Shanghai-Yichang route, the annual business has suffered a great loss. Within the North China route, only the regular three ships have slightly better business. The rest, such as the Andong and Yingkou routes, are also very deserted. On the Nanhua route, it is difficult to make a profit due to the lack of transshipment goods from the Yangtze River and North China. Only the newly added 12 ships on the Southeast Asia Islands route can make a profit because there are many overseas Chinese traveling to Fujian and Guangdong. The senior crew members of the company are mostly paid in gold pounds, and the secret losses this year are huge. Since September, the sailors have increased their wages, and the expenses have increased. The business losses this year are very huge. Fortunately, the capital is thick and the public accumulation is huge, so it does not matter much.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson: Jardine Matheson has more than 40 ships with 120,000 tons. There are fewer ships in the Yangtze River class than Taikoo. This year, the business on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is only 40% or 50% of the previous year. After the Mingsheng ship was sold, the Binhe ship was added and the Shanghai-Yichang class was opened. The annual business is only on this route, and the loss is at least 700,000 or 800,000 yuan. There are 13 regular ships in the North and South Oceans. The Hakka people in the North Ocean helped the company to fine the water feet, and they allied to refuse to load goods, so the business was even more depressed and the losses were also very huge. At the moment, because of refusing to increase the salaries of the sailors, the sailors and firemen of each ship intend to deal with it by decisive means. The trade union is mediating, but I don't know how to solve it.</p>
<p>Nissin Kisen Kaisha: Nissin Kisen Kaisha specializes in the Yangtze River line, so the ships are the same as Taikoo. This year, the company's upstream and downstream business has special relations with the major yarn and cloth customs declaration firms in Shanghai, so it is unique in its loading. (One piece of yarn and cloth can be worth ten pieces of miscellaneous goods for water feet.) The losses are less. The business in the first half of the year was quite lost, and the business in the second half of the year only saw improvement in December. Statistics must also be lost. The four ships in the North and South Oceans are fortunate enough to break even.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: Since the punitive military incident occurred, the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have been used for military purposes. The routes have been suspended one after another. Among the 25 ships in total, there were as many as 20 ships for difference. This year, the bureau was borrowing money to live on almost every day from January to August. After Zhao Tieqiao was assassinated, the situation in the bureau was at an unsustainable point, so Cai Pei and Chen Xizeng were unwilling to take over. Since Li Zhonggong came, he took on the dangerous situation despite all the difficulties and operated miserably. In the past four months, the business bureau, which was almost out of breath, has gradually moved towards a smooth path. The monthly expenditure of 300,000 can be paid out month by month without owing wages. After November, it took a further step to aggressively seek progress in the Yangtze River shipping industry. Shen Zhongyi in Shanghai and Li Yunliang in Hankou expanded the competition, and they can now leap over the six companies. The contribution of Shen and Li cannot be ignored. In the past, when the Yangtze River business of the bureau was the most prosperous, it was only 160,000 yuan a month, but now it can earn more than 200,000 yuan. However, there is only one ship on the upstream Yichang line, which is not enough to meet the demand. Li Zhonggong has decided to add four upstream oil-powered express ships for the development of Yichang and Hunan. The Nanhua route has also greatly improved in December. According to the current business (since November), the income of water feet on each route is enough to cover the expenses of the whole bureau. It is expected that according to the established steps in the spring, there will be a surplus. The new route in Southeast Asia is already in the process of chartering ships. Judging from the current business, according to the person in charge of the bureau, it is really an improvement that has not been seen since the Jiazi year.</p>
<p>Sanbei Company: Sanbei Company is the fastest-growing Chinese shipping company. It already has 18 river and sea commercial ships. It has been hit by wars for many years, and all coastal routes have been suspended. Only the Ningbo-Fujian and Yangtze River routes remain. This year, due to poor business, all the ships were leased for military use. At the same time, it also requested the issuance of 3 million yuan in sailing prices to add the Hongli and Hongzhen ships to expand the Yichang and Changsha classes, and built the Sanbei ship to operate the new route to Shenjiamen in eastern Zhejiang, which will soon be able to open. This year, the Yangtze River route has less losses. The sunken Feihu has already received 175,000 yuan in compensation from the headquarters. The Ningbo-Shanghai route, this year, the Ningxing ship has jumped to the top of the four ships.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Water Line Conference <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of the Three Companies Will Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News said that it had received news from Beijing that the Ministry of Communications and the three companies' water line conference had already agreed on the outline, and the details would be continued after the New Year's holiday. The representatives of the three companies have now set off to return to Shanghai, and according to reliable news, the Pacific Company has obtained the renewal of the landing rights for 14 years, and other companies have also handled it in the same way. This is what was agreed at the last meeting. In addition, the newspaper fee issue is said to have been agreed upon a fair method, but the details have not yet been ascertained. As for other disputed points, such as the recovery of the ground line, the right to receive and send, the increase in the price, the change of the brand name, and the style of the uniform, the detailed methods have already been largely agreed upon.</p>

<p>Please Issue Public Debt Receipts in Advance</p>
<p>The silk factory industry of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai petitioned the government to issue 10 million yuan of relief public bonds. Vice Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Finance has come to Shanghai and convened a meeting of representatives of the silk factory industry of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai to decide to issue 7 million yuan of public bonds, with 6 million yuan for temporary measures, which will be promoted by the silk factory industry of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai to relieve the silk market, and 1 million yuan for fundamental measures to handle the improvement of sericulture and the sericulture guidance institute, and the distribution method was also discussed and recorded. It is reported that the regulations of this public bond and the outline of the apportionment and compensation must be approved by the administrative meeting of the Executive Yuan and studied and revised by the Legislative Yuan before they can be issued. However, the silk factory industry is impatient and has petitioned the Ministry of Finance to issue receipts in advance to relieve the urgent need.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Resolution of Labor Dispute Over Year-End Bonuses at a French-Owned Water and Electricity Company <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Demand for Double Pay Led to a Half-Day Strike a Month Ago</p>
<p>Company Agrees to Graded Bonuses, Work Resumed Yesterday</p>
<p>The workers of a French-owned water and electricity company in this city held an emergency meeting at the labor union in Mingde Lane, Rue Lupan, on the 29th of last month. They resolved to demand a year-end bonus of one month's double pay for each person from the company. At 9:00 AM on the 30th, they appointed representatives, including Zhang Liansheng and five others, to make a direct request to Shen Shumei, the Chinese comprador of the French-owned water and electricity company in Lujiawan. Shen said, "This is a significant matter that I cannot resolve alone. I will discuss it with the manager, Meng Xiaolang (French), and then reply." By 12:00 noon, over 700 workers from the utility department held a mass meeting in the open space in front of the Lujiawan power plant. They resolved to go on a general strike at 1:00 PM that afternoon. The six representatives then negotiated with Compardor Shen and the manager. At 4:30 PM, the six representatives, including Zhang Liansheng, met with Compardor Shen. Shen stated that the manager wished the workers to resume work peacefully. Regarding the year-end bonus, it would be distributed according to years of service: (1) Those with two or more years of service would receive one month's double pay; (2) Those with one or more years of service would receive a bonus equivalent to seven-tenths of a month's wage; (3) Those with less than one year of service would receive a bonus equivalent to half a month's wage. However, the company's accounts for this year (i.e., last year) have already been finalized. The bonus funds would be distributed at 5:00 PM on the 31st (yesterday) and then added to the regular accounts. In the future, year-end bonuses would be distributed according to this precedent. The representatives deemed this satisfactory and reported back to the workers, who then fully resumed work yesterday morning. The over 700 workers in the transportation department did not participate in the strike. However, to ensure equal treatment, the company will also distribute bonuses to them according to the above precedent.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Opposition to the Auction of Stall Spaces in the Eight Immortals Bridge Market <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Petition Was Submitted to the Municipal Council… Hu Fangjin Appointed as Mediator</p>
<p>Small Vendors Organize a Group… Requesting Assistance from All Sides</p>
<p>The Eight Immortals Bridge Market in the French Concession has been under reconstruction for many months. All the vegetable vendors have been temporarily relocated to set up stalls in the open space in front of the Sino-French School to maintain their livelihoods. Now that the old market has been rebuilt with two stories, the vegetable vendors originally hoped to move back to their old locations after the market was completed and continue their business. However, yesterday's newspaper reported that the French Municipal Council would use an auction method to lease the stall spaces and stipulated eleven articles of regulations. The method involved an auction-style bidding, requiring annual bids in hopes of obtaining huge profits, resembling a stock exchange. Upon hearing this news, all the vegetable vendors panicked. They felt that this method would be unsustainable for small vendors who relied on meager capital for their livelihoods and would deprive them of their original right to occupy their stalls. Therefore, over 400 vegetable vendors collectively went to the French Municipal Council at the Big Bell Tower at 11:00 AM yesterday to stage a major petition. Upon witnessing the situation, the Western staff of the council were alarmed and immediately closed the doors. They also telegraphed the Big Bell Tower Police Station nearby to send officers to suppress the crowd. Concerned about their livelihoods, the vendors were unafraid and willing to face punishment. The police could not drive them away. Then, Mr. Hu Fangjin, the Chinese comprador of the council, came forward to mediate and offered heartfelt comfort to the vendors, saying, "The auction method was originally passed by the Municipal Council. Now that the vendors are concerned about their livelihoods, old stallholders can be allowed to bid first to show priority." However, the vendors unanimously expressed dissatisfaction and said that they would never agree to the auction of stall spaces. They asked Compardor Hu to appeal on behalf of the vendors and quickly propose a change to the Public Works Department. Mr. Hu agreed to find another solution and advised the vendors to disperse first. Knowing that Mr. Hu understood their hardships, the vendors followed his instructions and immediately dispersed. However, after leaving the Municipal Council, they regrouped in the temporary market in front of the Sino-French School and held a general meeting to discuss solutions. They elected 25 representatives to form the Eight Immortals Bridge Market Stallholders' Joint Association to present reasons and request assistance from the other side to achieve the goal of canceling the auction. At the same time, they will publish a translated declaration stating the reasons why they cannot bid. They will continue to petition the five Chinese directors and nine committee members of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession to achieve their ultimate goal.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Meeting of Holders of Provisional Exchange Certificates <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Nomination of Representatives for Petition</p>
<p>Wu Tingyu, Pan Jiazhen, and Dong Xihou</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Holders of Provisional Exchange Certificates of the Central Bank and National Treasury Bills of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government held a committee meeting in the afternoon. They elected Wu Deyu as chairman to preside over the meeting. First, the chairman reported on the association's activities over the past two months. Next, they discussed that since the association's establishment, they had repeatedly petitioned the National Government, the Chairman, and Minister of Finance Song to request expedited handling and full redemption. According to news from political circles, this was expected to be achieved, but no official approval had been received, causing deep concern. Given the current situation, they felt that a personal petition to the capital was necessary to express their sincere feelings and demonstrate their integrity. Therefore, the selection of representatives for the petition should be determined immediately to facilitate progress. The committee members unanimously nominated Wu Deyu, Pan Jiazhen, and Dong Xihou as representatives to travel to the capital to petition. They also decided that the representatives would depart before January 12th. Next, Pan Jiazhen reported on the registration situation. It was unanimously stated that the largest circulation of these notes was in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The Jiangxi provincial government had already recovered three million yuan in Central-England Bonds. Furthermore, due to unrest in these provinces in recent years and the prevalence of soldiers and bandits, most of these notes were likely lost. The association should base its request to the government on the verified number of notes already registered by the association, requesting that the government fully recover and redeem them. This was resolved and passed. Next, it was decided to close the registration. All registration forms and records would be sent to legal counsel, Attorney Sheng Zhenwei, for review and safekeeping. Additionally, the travel expenses for the petitioning representatives would be temporarily advanced by the committee members. Zhou Banruo was tasked with drafting the petition. The meeting adjourned after these matters were discussed.</p>

<h3 id="e89">China National Anti-Opium Society <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Declaration Advocating Complete Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>The China National Anti-Opium Society issued a declaration stating: "The scourge of opium weakens the country and harms the people. After the National Government established Nanjing, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang initially adopted a policy of implicitly permitting opium by taxing it. However, they later followed public opinion and resolutely abolished it, adopting a policy of complete prohibition and establishing an Opium Prohibition Committee to demonstrate their determination. The people hoped that the international community would take this seriously, believing that the Opium Prohibition Committee, having been created by public opinion, would be able to effectively implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's anti-opium teachings and realize the people's demand for opium prohibition. However, for the past two years, although the opium prohibition authorities have had plans to eliminate opium, they have lacked decisive and forceful action. Major cases such as officials transporting opium and warlords planting opium have occurred repeatedly, and most have ended inconclusively, causing social suspicion and international mockery. The situation has not improved. The planting of opium is still widespread in the northwest and southwest provinces, and even Anhui and Fujian are not exempt. Recently, southern Fujian has even faced a grain shortage crisis due to this. The forced planting of opium by the military has not stopped. Opium taxes are relied upon in Hunan and Hubei, and the sale of opium is openly conducted in Guangdong and Guangxi. Opium dens are scattered throughout the French Concession in Shanghai, and opium smuggling via Yangtze River steamers continues unabated, all becoming more rampant. This has only led to the people shouting and protesting themselves hoarse, without any effective measures being taken. Despite the nationwide struggle of the people over the past year, the results are disheartening. Now that the Fourth Plenary Session has been held, the government, following the resolutions, is preparing to vigorously enforce opium prohibition. Our society, which has always been dedicated to upholding Dr. Sun Yat-sen's anti-opium teachings and realizing the people's desire for opium prohibition, feels compelled to offer our humble suggestions to the authorities during this period of transition. Perhaps a foolish person's insights can help others polish their jade. We have observed that various countries around the world have adopted many methods for opium prohibition, but the opium prohibition policy is paramount. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings have clearly shown us that the business of opium cannot coexist with the national government that is empowered by the people. Anyone who advocates for the legal permission of the opium business is an enemy of public opinion. He also said, 'Any responsible government agency that lowers its flag and ceases fighting against opium, regardless of the duration, is committing an act of selling out the country.' Furthermore, complete opium prohibition is stipulated in the Kuomintang's platform, and the policy of prohibition is also demanded by the entire nation. The National Government has the responsibility to uphold and implement it, and the obligation to develop and promote it. We sincerely hope that the authorities will embrace this principle and strive to implement it, not weakening due to obstacles or retreating due to difficulties. Although opium prohibition plans have been formulated over the years, in reality, the military protects and forces the planting of opium, and corrupt officials tax and condone opium trafficking, just as in the past. This is not the fault of the prohibition laws but rather the ineffective implementation of them. Recently, there have been calls to implement an opium monopoly to increase tax revenue, and it is rumored that this has already been agreed to by certain parties and will soon be implemented. Opium dealers are celebrating and eager to try it out. Our society firmly hopes that these rumors are false. However, there is no smoke without fire, and there is reason to believe that this is not entirely unfounded. Financial difficulties do not mean there are no other ways to raise funds. Why must we resort to opium, violating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, undermining the Kuomintang's platform, degrading our international standing, and destroying the opium prohibition treaties? Previously, when the League of Nations sent a Far East Investigation Team to investigate the opium situation, its purpose was to extend the opium monopoly policy to increase tax revenue. Our government and people were well aware of this and united to oppose it. Now, if we implement a monopoly ourselves, we would be taking over the previous opposition to foreigners profiting from opium trafficking to harm our people, and instead, killing our own compatriots. This would be tantamount to slapping ourselves in the face, which is extremely shameful. Today, the people's livelihoods are exhausted and industries are declining. We should seek ways to enrich the country and the people, not take poisonous measures to quench our thirst. The leaders of the party and the country are well aware of the people's suffering. At a time when internal conflicts have been resolved, it is an opportunity to start anew with the people. The laxity of opium prohibition is undeniable, and the difficulties in implementation are also real. Let the past be dead, and let the future be born. It is not too late to catch up and strive forward. Our society's responsibility lies in rejecting opium. Because of our deep concern, we cannot remain silent. Our hope for the National Government to eliminate opium is deep, and our words are also painful. Our society has no political color or factional purpose. Our statements come from sincerity. We hope that 1931 will be the year of the implementation of opium prohibition in our country. It will be fortunate for our compatriots and fortunate for our party and country."</p>

<p>Effective Today</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Notice No. 123 reads: "Regarding the matter of this bureau taking over and reorganizing the Nanshi docks, as ordered by the Municipal Government, a public notice has already been issued. The docking fee regulations previously established by the Port Authority for the Nanshi docks, specifically articles three and four, calculate docking fees based on the registered length of ships and use feet as the standard.

The above-mentioned docking fees should be converted to meters for charging based on the original dimensions. However, to avoid complicated calculations with odd numbers, revised tables have been carefully considered and approved by the Municipal Government. These will be implemented starting January 1, 1931. This notice is hereby issued for public awareness."</p>

<p>Refusal to Publish Dutch Ship Names in Mail Timetable</p>
<p>Letter from the Support Association for Diplomatic Relations with the Netherlands to the Postal Commissioner</p>
<p>The Support Association for Diplomatic Relations with the Netherlands believes that the anti-Dutch movement is actively underway, and it is alarming that the city's mail timetable even contains export information for Java ships. They sent a letter to the Postal Commissioner, stating: "Respectfully, regarding the case of the Zhibade ship of the Java Company insulting our country's female teacher Xiao Xinan, the entire nation is outraged. Previously, letters were sent by various overseas Chinese to the Shanghai Postal Administration, requesting that the publication of Java Company ship export information be refused in the mail timetable until a satisfactory resolution is reached in the diplomatic negotiations with the Netherlands. This request has been granted multiple times, and the public has deeply appreciated this. Unexpectedly, the previous few weeks ago, your bureau's mail timetable contained an advertising the duty of the enemy ship Zhibade, and today's mail timetable also conspicuously contains the name of the Zhishendali ship. Considering that the anti-Dutch movement is currently actively underway, all maritime newspapers are refusing to publish Java Company advertisements and Java Company ship import and export information. Your bureau is a public institution of our country, and should unanimously hate the public enemy. We sincerely urge the staff responsible for compiling the mail timetable to refuse to list Java Company ship names from today onwards, to show solidarity."</p>

<p>The Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe, led by Mr. Li Jinhui, a pioneer of modern song and dance, consists of over 40 members. After touring Southeast Asia, they returned to Shanghai and spent two years in Beijing studying Mandarin. Therefore, the troupe members have a deeper understanding of enunciation and pronunciation. They performed in Northeast China and Tianjin this autumn and were well-received. This time, Great China Records spared no expense in hiring the entire troupe to come to Shanghai to record a large number of songs, approximately over a hundred, which will be released gradually soon. Taking advantage of the fact that the Shanghai Asia-America Company Radio Broadcasting Station will be closed for New Year's Day, the company has specially invited the entire troupe to hold a special program on the evening of January 5th, from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM, for two hours. The entire troupe's musicians will provide musical accompaniment, and Ms. Wang Renmei, Ms. Li Lili, and Ms. Hu Jia will take turns singing. The program will include "Xiang River Wave," "I Am Willing," "Yang Bo Zhe," "Sweet Dreams," "Spring Colors of the West Lake," "Flower of Love," a five-minute break, "How Can I Bear to Leave You," "Wait a Minute," "Martha Returns in Spring," "Hengyang Golden Drum," "I Want Everything from You," "Butterfly Girl," "Willow Dancing," "Under the Sword's Edge," and sixteen other songs. Anyone with a radio receiver at home is requested to tune in on time. Furthermore, all of the above songs have been recorded by Great China Records and will be released around the first month of the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Music Society The Municipal Hall Plum Blossom Song and Dance Convention will hold a three-day New Year's celebration starting today. The ticket prices remain the same. There will be three shows each day, at 3:00 PM, 5:30 PM, and 9:00 PM. In addition to eight new programs, the grand song and dance drama "Nong Li Yan Tao" and two acts from "Seven Emotions" will be performed. Both dramas are extremely popular and are being performed at the same time, which is particularly rare. The entire White Snow Music Society will also perform the Chinese song "Plum Blossom" at each show. The song and the entire "Seven Emotions" drama have now been recorded by Victory Records, which shows their value. "Plum Blossom" is the first Chinese dance music to be recorded.</p>
<p>Harmonica Concert The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Assembly Hall will hold a grand harmonica concert this Saturday, January 3rd, at 8:00 PM. The concert will be hosted by the China Harmonica Society.

In particular, "Amitabha," composed by Wang Qingxun, president of the society, is novel and unique and has long been popular. Tickets are priced at 5 jiao and 1 yuan, and there will be a temporary ticket booth at the entrance of the venue.</p>
<p>Guangyu Society Storytelling There are thousands of households in this city equipped with radio receivers. Listening to broadcast music during the New Year's holiday is a great form of entertainment. However, it is regrettable that most broadcasting stations will be suspending broadcasting during these days. Recognizing this, the Shanghai Wireless Electric Company has specially negotiated with the laboratory of Liu Zongxiao, a shareholder of the company, to invite the famous Guangyu Society storytelling artist Jin Yaosun and others to perform "Yu Qing Ting" and other music from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily from New Year's Day to the 5th, which is a new addition to the New Year's festivities.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Establishment of Conciliation Office in Special District Court <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>For Civil Cases</p>
<p>All Kinds of Civil Cases</p>
<p>Will First Undergo Conciliation by Both Parties</p>
<p>If No Reconciliation is Possible</p>
<p>Then a Public Trial Will Be Held</p>
<p>The population of this city is increasing year by year and has now reached over three million. The increase is most noticeable in the International Settlement, which has led to greater commercial prosperity. However, as human affairs become increasingly complex, disputes over trivial matters naturally arise endlessly. As a result of these disputes, most end up in court. This is why the number of lawsuits in the Special District Local Court is increasing daily. However, once these types of civil cases are heard, the rights and wrongs are immediately clear, and there is no deep-seated animosity. If someone were to impartially mediate in advance, a resolution would likely be faster than a trial. Recognizing this, the court has established a civil case conciliation office. Starting this New Year's Day, all civil lawsuits will be first summoned to the court by the staff of the conciliation office. Without holding a formal hearing, they will inquire about the points of contention. Once the cause is clear, they will mediate between the two parties and persuade them to settle their dispute. If both parties respect the mediator's intentions, abandon the lawsuit, and express a willingness to reconcile, the mediator will facilitate a peaceful resolution. In the event that their opinions differ and there is no sincere intention to reconcile, or if the case cannot be resolved without legal intervention, the mediator will not force a reconciliation. Instead, a date will be set for a public trial. This method is newly created, takes into account both law and reason, and is beneficial and harmless. It is expected that once implemented, civil lawsuits will be greatly reduced. The location of the conciliation office has been designated by President Yang Zhaosun as the room next to the civil court. A sign for the conciliation office has been made and hung above the door of the room for public awareness.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Mourning and Honors for Zhu Chengzhang <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Over a Thousand Mourners at Yesterday's Interment</p>
<p>Three Institutions Fly Flags at Half-Mast in Mourning</p>
<p>The late banker Mr. Zhu Chengzhang's interment was held yesterday at 4 PM at the International Funeral Home. His remains were sent to the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road for burial. Mr. Zhu had many friends during his lifetime, and yesterday, no fewer than a thousand people came to pay their respects and assist with the coffin. The plain carriages and white horses showed extreme honor and mourning. The deceased had served society for nearly twenty years, and the various enterprises he founded were quite remarkable. Moreover, he was always sincere in his dealings with others. His tragic and sudden death inevitably causes sorrow.</p>
<p>Names of Mourners: Those who attended the mourning and assisted with the coffin yesterday included Song Ziwen (represented by Song Ziliang), Qian Xinzhi, Huang Renzhi, Shen Enfu, Yang Dunfu, Yang Xianfen, Ou Weiguo, Zhuo Yongshi, Xi Jigeng, Fan Jimei, Fu Ruoyu, Pan Mingxin, Hu Jun'an, Xu Moude, Yan Deqing, Xia Xiaofang, Xu Xiuzhi, Hu Xuanming, Liu Zhan'en, Wang Boheng, Liu Hongsheng, Fan Zhigui, Zhuang Dezhi, Zou Bingwen, Xu Jiqing, Li Fusun, Wu Yunzhai, Qu Yingguang, Xia Juchuan, Lin Kanghou, Shou Jingwei, Diao Xinde, Chen Shiguang, Li Moxi, and Western guests, as well as all staff members of the National Goods Bank, Shanghai Bank, and China Travel Service, totaling over a thousand people. They were all received by Mr. Zhu's younger brother, Chenghou, and relatives Huang Hongdao and his brothers. Yesterday, the National Goods Bank, Shanghai Bank, and China Travel Service all flew flags at half-mast to show their deep mourning. The traffic on Jiaozhou Road was so congested that it almost became impassable. The Jing'an Temple Road police station dispatched many Chinese and foreign detectives to direct traffic and take care of everything.</p>
<p>The Interment Ceremony: Mr. Zhu's remains were moved from the upstairs to the downstairs hall at 4 PM. The mourners waited in silence, and all who saw the coffin were saddened. Then, Pastor Zhu Baoyuan led the congregation in singing hymns. The mournful sound was mixed with sighs. Dr. Yu Rizhang gave a speech before the coffin, stating that everyone deeply regretted Mr. Zhu Chengzhang's tragic death. However, his short life and contributions to society were already very obvious. If Heaven had granted him a longer life, his achievements would have been even more immeasurable. Mr. Zhu's success was due to his great personality and sound virtues. Although his physical body has withered, his spirit will endure forever, serving as an example for us all.</p>
<p>Many Assisted with the Coffin: After the interment, the coffin was transported to the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road. The mourners proceeded with the coffin under the bleak sky, and the scene was very solemn. Behind the hearse, there were hundreds of vehicles following the procession. The wreaths that filled the hall were also transported to the cemetery and piled at the tomb.</p>
<p>Condolence Telegrams: After Mr. Zhu's death, many condolence telegrams were received from various parties. (1) The Telegraph Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed: "To Brother Xie Wentong, we were shocked to hear of your uncle's passing. We are deeply saddened. We hope you will cope with the changes and take care of yourself. We send our condolences. From all colleagues of the Telegraph Department."

(3) The owner of the Da Lai Company, Robert Dolla, in San Francisco, was deeply saddened by the news of Mr. Zhu's death and also sent a telegram of condolence yesterday.</p>

<p>Donglu Harbor Town Robbed</p>
<p>Nineteen Men and Women Kidnapped</p>
<p>At about 8 PM the night before last, eight bandit ships sailed to Dongling Harbor Town outside Wusong Estuary. About a hundred pirates, carrying weapons, landed and first fired dozens of shots into the air as a demonstration. Then they surrounded and searched more than two hundred shops and residences in the town, all of which were looted. No one escaped. Before leaving, they kidnapped five men and women from the family of Yuan Daocai, three men and women from the family of Zhang Changfa, three men and women from the family of Shen Yizhen, and eight men and women from the family of Gong Tingxi. They were taken aboard the bandit ships, and the ships sailed away. The bandits said that they would notify each family of the ransom amount after it was assessed, agree on a location, and prepare the money for redemption.</p>

<p>Tragically Murdered Male Corpse</p>
<p>The Deceased Appears to be a Gangster</p>
<p>The Cause of Death is Suspected to be a Revenge Killing</p>
<p>A tragic assassination occurred in the fields beside the Yangjia Bridge railway tracks at the Zhenru Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The circumstances are investigated and recorded below:</p>
<p>Elegantly Dressed Male Corpse: Yangjia Bridge is located in a remote area, rarely visited, especially at night. The day before yesterday (the 30th), a villager going to market saw a well-dressed man who had been shot to death, covered in blood. The blood was still fresh. He was shocked and shouted loudly. The patrol police from the Third Section of the Fourth District learned of this and, after investigation, reported it to the station. They began an investigation but did not know his name. They ordered the local bailiff to report the verification.</p>
<p>Multiple Gunshot Wounds on the Body: In the afternoon, after the bailiff reported the verification to the Local Court, the prosecutor Wu Shixin, accompanied by the examiner Xuan Zhiming and clerks and bailiffs, rushed to the scene by car. The corpse was found to be about 30 years old, wearing a silk-lined velvet long gown, gabardine lined jacket and trousers, a woolen short shirt, a sanitary undershirt, woolen socks, dark green leggings, black velvet shoes, and a new-style long overcoat of reddish-purple Mackintosh. The name "Xing Youling" was attached to the coat pocket, presumably the name of the deceased. However, the deceased had a shaved head (due to ringworm) and was wearing a wig. As for the wounds, one gunshot entered the forehead and exited the back of the head. Another bullet entered below the right ear and did not penetrate. Two gunshots to the abdomen also did not penetrate. It was determined that the death was caused by the wounds. The post-mortem report was filled out, photographs were taken, and the body was taken to the mortuary, awaiting identification and arrest of the murderer.</p>
<p>The Deceased Resembles Xing ErMao: The deceased was of medium build and very thin. It is said that the person looked like Xing ErMao, because ErMao was bald and wore a wig. His name was also Youling. He lived at the Hanqiao of the North Railway Station and had no occupation, that is, what Shanghai people call a gangster. Therefore, this case is determined to be a revenge killing. The court has sent police to investigate the family.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Bizarre Divorce Case of the Wife of a Cook at Da San Yuan <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>How Can a Husband Connive at Another Man's Adultery with His Wife?</p>
<p>Ms. Yang Accuses Her Husband of Having a Hidden Illness</p>
<p>The Sister-in-Law Acts as the Husband</p>
<p>The Cook Boasts That He Can Fulfill His Duties</p>
<p>The Judge Orders a Medical Examination for Further Review</p>
<p>Hu Guanfu, a cook at the Da San Yuan Restaurant, is from the Hua Jing Township of Longhua. He has some property. On November 5th of the sixteenth year, he married Ms. Yang, who was from the same village. They initially lived in the countryside for about two months. Later, Hu was employed in the concession and lived far from home, making it inconvenient to return. So, he moved his wife to the concession. He left early and returned late. On December 16th of the eighteenth year, Ms. Yang suddenly disappeared. She returned in March of the following year, insisting that Hu take her back to the countryside. But on the day they were supposed to return, she disappeared again. In July, they met at Zhaofeng Garden. Hu saw that her abdomen was as big as a five-stone gourd, and he knew that she had been unfaithful. They argued, and afterward, Ms. Yang hired a lawyer to file for divorce in the Special District Court. She claimed that Hu had only spent forty yuan on the engagement gift, while her dowry was worth more than two hundred yuan. Not long after the wedding, Hu admitted to having a hidden illness, and because the family was poor, Hu's sister, Wang, accompanied her to work at the Shenxin Yarn Factory and lived at her sister's house. As a result, she was raped by her brother-in-law, Shi Xuetang. Wang told her that Hu could not have sexual relations because of his illness and asked him to</p>
<p>Act as Husband to Ensure Offspring and Prevent Extinction. She Promised That Her Life Would Be Maintained by Shi. She, A Weak Woman, Could Not Resist, and Was Seduced by Flattery, Leading To Defilement. Afterward, She Lived With Wang In Several Places. Hu Knew But Did Not Speak. This Shows That His Hidden Illness and Entrusting Her Sister-In-Law To Act As Husband Are Real. Over Time, Hu's Sister Wang Became Jealous And Conspired With Hu To Deceive Her Into Going To The French Concession, Intending To Sell Her. She Saw Through This And Called Out. Last January, She Was Lured To Shanghai By Wang Yuntang And Lived With Him For Six Or Seven Months, Then Was Abandoned, Without A Means Of Survival. She Returned To Her Ex-Husband, Who Ignored Her.</p>
<p>The Pregnancy Resulting From The Rape Has Now Led To Childbirth, Further Worsening Her Plight. Hu And His Sister And Brother-In-Law Conspired To Abuse Her, Starting With Affection And Ending With Abandonment. In Addition To Filing A Separate Lawsuit Against Wang Xuetang, She Requested A Divorce From Hu Guanfu. Hu, Having Been Accused, Also Hired Lawyer Hong Shihao To Argue His Case. He Relayed That Ms. Yang Soon Disappeared After The Marriage, And The Details Of The Argument At Zhaofeng Garden. He Did Not Deny Having A Hidden Illness, Saying That Although He Was A Simple Village Fool, Not As Handsome As Song Yu, He Still</p>
<p>Could Fulfill His Duties In Bed And Did Not Need The Help Of Others. The Statement That He Has A Hidden Illness And That He Entrusted Someone To Act On His Behalf, Even Fabricating That He Conspired With Wang Xuetang To Entice And Rape Her, Is Extremely Outrageous. Since She Has Made This Claim, She Must Bear The Burden Of Proof. She Cannot Make Empty Accusations. If He Really Has A Hidden Illness And Cannot Satisfy Her Desires, How Could A Fickle Woman Like The Plaintiff Enter Into A Marriage For Three Years? The Fabrications And False Accusations Are Clear. Moreover, He Married The Plaintiff To Continue The Lineage. How Could There Be Such A Thing</p>
<p>As A Husband Coniving At Another Man's Adultery With His Wife? The Plaintiff Admits To Committing Adultery As A Pretext For Divorce. However, Looking At The Reason For The Original Lawsuit, It Is Full Of Bizarre And Absurd Claims, None Of Which Meet The Conditions For Divorce. Her Lawsuit Should Be Dismissed And She Should Be Ordered To Live With The Defendant To Correct The Social Mores. Yesterday Morning, The Trial Was Held. The Plaintiff Insisted That The Defendant Had A Hidden Illness And Had Never Fulfilled His Duties As A Husband, While The Defendant's Testimony Was To The Contrary And He Voluntarily Requested An Examination. Judge Xu Then Ordered A Medical Examination Before Another Hearing.</p>

<p>Xinhua Bank, located on Jiangxi Road in this city, was established more than ten years ago and was one of the earliest banks in the Chinese banking industry to initiate savings deposits. It is now actively reorganizing with the addition of capital from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications and establishing trust services.

<p>Totaling Three Points</p>
<p>The divorce case of lawyer Dong Yu, who sued his wife Jiang Youzhi for divorce, failed to be resolved. Jiang has now applied for assistance from the Municipal Women's Association. It is reported that the Women's Association has accepted the petition and is preparing to forward it to the French Concession Court for a fair judgment. Jiang's demands are as follows: (1) If they live together, improve the treatment and do not continue to live in the pavilion, with a repelling attitude, worse than that of a maidservant. (2) If they live separately, prepare adequate living expenses and expenses for the daughter's marriage when she grows up, which must be effectively guaranteed and not just empty words that cannot be obtained. (3) In order for Dong Yu to fulfill one of these two demands, Youzhi allows him to marry anyone, sacrifices everything, and will never interfere, and signs documents as evidence. It is said that Wu Tianni, Jiang's maternal grandfather, recently conveyed that if the lawsuit is won, she should enjoy the rights of the judgment. She (referring to Youzhi) does not want to accept the condition of 3,000 yuan in interest-bearing alimony, and the marriage expenses must be returned, which is her own fault. If the lawsuit is lost, she will file another lawsuit for cohabitation, requesting cohabitation and improved treatment in the pavilion, which goes without saying. But her ability cannot control one Ms. Lu, and if I marry someone stronger than Ms. Lu, and the two of them live together, let's see what her ability is. The implication is nothing more than a demonstration of a final break.</p>

<p>Misunderstanding with Zhan Jifeng Resolved</p>
<p>It is reported that the misunderstanding between the fourteen small newspaper offices and lawyer Zhan Jifeng has been resolved, and they are back on good terms. The exchange of letters between the two parties is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from Zhan Jifeng to the Various Small Newspaper Offices: Gentlemen, in the case of Ms. Hu Die suing Lu Yifang, editor of the Ling Bao, in the Shanghai Special District Court for defamation, when I stated in court, I only said, "This is not a flyer, but something published in a newspaper. Even if it is a contribution, the editor should be responsible," and did not say anything about this type of flyer-like newspaper engaging in deceptive practices. There is a court transcript that cannot be arbitrarily deleted or altered. I have many literary friends in the small newspaper industry, and insulting literary friends is tantamount to insulting myself. I am not so foolish as to do this. This record is clearly a misunderstanding based on hearsay or deliberately exaggerated by interested parties to provoke discord. I fear that the misunderstanding will spread further, so I hereby correct it. Furthermore, I am always in favor of peace. Even in this case with Ling Bao, I wrote a letter in advance to advise them to make sincere corrections, but unfortunately, they were not accepted. Instead, they made insincere corrections and published a satirical piece in the next issue, which provoked the lawsuit and could not be stopped.

<h3 id="e104">Gold Firm Manager <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Embezzlement of Huge Sums Case Rescheduled for Hearing</p>
<p>Shi Yulin, manager of Yong Sheng Chang Gold Firm, Huang Hongxuan, the accountant, and Shi Xianglin, the runner, colluded to defraud the accounts and embezzle the huge sum of 173,250.222 taels of silver. It is really the largest case of embezzlement by commercial employees in recent years. After Shi and others were sued by shareholders Gu Yuanruo, Wang Boyuan, Wu Shanqing, and You Xianghe, who hired three lawyers Wang Fuchang, Chen Zhongyin, and Tao Wuzhi to the Special District Court, they were arrested by the police. People in the gold industry regarded it as a major case, unprecedented. Each time the trial was held, many people came to listen. The day before yesterday afternoon, when Judge Zhou Hanting continued the hearing, the audience was still full. The defendants hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Chen Ying to defend them. First, lawyer Chen Tingrui spoke, saying that the plaintiff's indictment listed twelve charges of criminal facts against the defendant, all of which were general terms and did not state who committed what crime. Moreover, the situation in the gold industry is complex, and the details are not known to outsiders. The plaintiff should be ordered to submit all the books and documents to the Gold Industry Association for detailed investigation or clarification, otherwise, it would be difficult for the defendant to answer. For example, the twelfth charge against him is the entanglement of the 4,000 yuan deposit in the Jin Cheng Bank, which is actually a misunderstanding. If the defendant has enough time, he will be able to prove each item. Lawyer Chen Ying continued by saying that the gold industry transactions have neither goods nor cash, like gambling, which is actually speculation. Gambling should be illegal. The judge should order the police lawyer to file a lawsuit against the plaintiff for making speculation a regular business. If the police do not want to sue, then please ask the prosecutor to exercise the power of indictment so that speculation can be reduced. Judge Zhou said that this was another matter and had nothing to do with this case, and ordered the lawyer not to mix it up, but to debate the case according to the law, so as not to cause complications. Then the defendant's lawyer requested a postponement to prepare the defense. The court granted the request and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody for another hearing in fourteen days.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Recent Events of the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association has extended the deadline for the spring license tax for tobacco and alcohol due to the National New Year. Yesterday, it specially notified the industry that the case was investigated. The period from January 1st to 10th of the 20th year is the period for renewing the spring licenses. The association informed the Second District Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office yesterday that the agency is on holiday for several days at the beginning of the National New Year and inquired about the start date and extension deadline of the letter. The letter stated that the period for renewing the spring tobacco and alcohol license tax for the 20th year is limited to January 1st to 10th. However, according to recent reports, all agencies will be on holiday for four days at the beginning of the National New Year. During this period, will your office stop collecting taxes, or will it start collecting taxes on January 5th and extend the deadline to January 14th? We should consult and reply so that we can notify our industry to renew the new spring license within the time limit so that both the tax and the business will suffer no losses. After sending it to the office, the office replied that all agencies have been on holiday for four days at the beginning of the National New Year, and our office should also comply with the order, from the 31st of this month to the 3rd of January of the 20th year, suspend the collection for four days, and set it to open on January 4th and extend the deadline to January 13th. The letter should be checked and all the treasure shops that should be renewed for the spring tobacco and alcohol licenses must go to renew them from January 4th to 13th, within ten days, and must not be overdue to be fined. This is the most important special notice and also to propose the case of cutting the li tax. The Shanghai South Office continued to send a letter to the Executive Committee stating, "Gentlemen, we have received a letter from the Soy Sauce and Alcohol Industry Association stating that we have received a public letter from your association stating that the three opinions submitted by our association a few days ago have been accepted by your Executive Committee, and we have convened a joint discussion to facilitate the launch, etc. Because of this matter, our association should convene the Executive Committee to send representatives, but it cannot be held because of the hasty end of the year. Moreover, Chairman Zhang is going to Beijing on official business and must return to Shanghai in early January. Fortunately, it is a matter of concern to the two industries of your industry. Our association asks ourselves to have a spirit of struggle and not to fall behind. After your association proposed it, our association should follow the lead and not shirk its responsibility. It is a matter of course to work hard and carry it out. This is the case, and the office should check it and carry out the work with perseverance and without fear." The office had previously reported that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee had resolved to implement the new business tax after the li tax was changed, and that similar fee taxes such as the state-run sales of tobacco and alcohol and tobacco and alcohol licenses should be abolished to conform to the system and reduce the burden. The opinion was proposed and sent to the Executive Committee, and the original text was sent to the Soy Sauce and Alcohol Industry Association to seek consent. Subsequently, the association approved a letter of reply, including three opinions, and then our office sent a letter to your association for review and implementation. It was decided by your association at the 14th Executive Committee meeting on the 23rd to first urge the Soy Sauce and Alcohol Industry Association to hold a joint meeting on a regular basis, and then jointly send letters to the relevant industry associations to solicit comrades. The office was asked to send invitations to the cases on file, and the letter stated the cause and sent a letter to the Executive Committee Chairman Chen to check it and carry out the work with perseverance.</p>

<p>New Year's Day (Thursday)</p>
<p>Lok Wah vs. Western Police ...... Baseball Field</p>
<p>The New Year's Day holiday, with all things renewed and all in the sports circle, male and female fans alike, feel especially interested at the beginning of the year. Today, there are five Chinese teams and two Western teams participating in the football matches. The Group A match between Lok Wah and the Western Police at the baseball field is more interesting. Today, Lok Wah's strength may become a one-sided affair. If Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Chen Yutian, and others play against each other, countless fans will be greatly comforted.</p>
<p>Chinese Football Club Pagoda vs. Guangyi (Football 1) 9:00 AM, Baseball Field</p>

<p>2nd (Friday)</p>
<p>Tsinghua vs. Hujiang ...... Football Field</p>
<p>Zhenru vs. Howard ...... Baseball Field</p>
<p>There are two major important ball games today. One is the North-South Friendship Game, Tsinghua vs. Hujiang, and the other is the Western Association's Group B game, Zhenru vs. Howard. When Tsinghua met Jinan for the first time, it certainly gave us a very good impression. This time against Hujiang, it will surely have even better results. Hujiang, as a strong opponent, will definitely not show weakness. A fierce battle is expected. As for Zhenru vs. Howard, it is indeed a meeting of evenly matched opponents. It is really impossible for outsiders to predict who will win. However, according to Liang Guocai, the team's director, the team members have already made up their minds to use their iron heads and legs to fight with the giants of the Western team for ninety minutes to determine the outcome. Also, the battle between the West Qing Basketball Association's Jinguang and Maling that evening is also very worth watching.</p>

<p>3rd (Saturday)</p>
<p>Zhenru vs. Lax ... Mei Ball Field</p>
<p>Today is Zhenru Football Team's last game before going to the Philippines. The opponent, Lax, is a leader in this area, but at most it can only confront Zhenru and will not cause any danger. Because today Zhenru's ball skills have improved by leaps and bounds, it is no longer comparable to the past. It seems not difficult to defeat the enemy and win.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association, hosted by the Progressive Association, will open on this day. Those who appear on the field are all in Group B. Group A will start in a week. Also, the West Qing Basketball Association has five group matches, all of which are one-sided situations.</p>

<p>Tsinghua vs. Lingnan ... Baseball Field</p>
<p>Tsinghua will play against the powerful Lingnan team today, which is the finale of the North-South Football Friendship Game. Those of us who admire Tsinghua's ball skills should not miss this good opportunity. Also, the match between Lok Wah and Huasesi in Shenyuan may not attract the attention of the general public, because the match between Tsinghua and Lingnan is more exciting.</p>

<p>Tsinghua Football Team ... Leaves Shanghai and Returns to Ping</p>
<p>Today, the Tsinghua Football Team will say goodbye to the people of Shanghai and lead its team back to Ping. Tsinghua's visit has made a great contribution to promoting sports, and it will attract the attention of universities in the North and South to strive for progress. Also, the programs of the Shanghai and West Qing Basketball Associations today are not very attractive.</p>

Jinan's trip is at the invitation of the country's government to participate in the Sino-Western Charity Grand Competition. With Jinan's strong strength and benevolent spirit, it will surely achieve something in the Philippines to comfort the hopes of our people. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>Today's Schedule ... Not Very Exciting</p>
<p>Today's ball game is one of the least exciting scenes in the New Year's schedule. It is also a situation of prosperity and decline.</p>

<p>Twenty New Year's Day Spring Lantern Ode · Cheng · Zhan · Lu</p>
<p>Heaven opens civilization. No one. Disobeys. Benefiting these people is not necessary to divine. Having sheathed our bows. Enjoying ourselves with cups. Completing the revolution. Cheering with hats off. Auspicious atmosphere throughout the sky. More than enough. Heaven minus man is two. Down minus divination and drawing minus bow. Combine to make ten. Complete minus hat is Yuan. Throughout minus one is Dan. The ode hides the four characters "Twenty New Year's Day".</p>
<p>Retrospect and Hope for New Year's Day Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Pepper platters offer the year, cypress wine welcomes spring. Is this not the New Year's Day festival? Today, announcing the new moon and offering sheep. Following the national calendar. Treading this new year. Reminding of the past and looking to the future. Cannot be without words. Retrospecting since the founding of the Republic of China. As far as memory goes. The overthrow of autocracy in the first year of the Republic of China. Establishing a democratic polity. And Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen. Was elected as the first president. The national jubilation on New Year's Day. Was the most enthusiastic. Afterwards, the government moved north. Xiangcheng defied the world's disapproval. Presumptuously proclaimed himself emperor. Eventually, the martyr Cai Songpo rose up in anger and abolished it. After the era of Hejian, Huangpi, Donghai Zhongshan, and Hefei. No year went without cyclical warfare. Getting worse every year. Not to mention the bleak New Year's Day. Even National Day was a bitter smile. In the spring of the sixteenth year. The revolution succeeded. The government moved south. Thus, the atmosphere was renewed. The whole country celebrated. Now, the north and south have joined hands. The unification is consolidated. Is this not a phoenix singing towards the sun? A happy phenomenon of coming from adversity? While we celebrate the National New Year's Day with joy and excitement. Our only hope. Is to wish the government sound. The country permanently unified. As long as the evergreen pine and cypress. As radiant as the sun and moon.</p>
<p>Precious New Year's Auspicious Words Liu Mei Ju</p>
<p>The National New Year. Strictly enforced from the beginning. Those who serve in political life. Live in this era. Be people of this era. Their auspicious words supporting the new initiatives. Are certainly all out of sincerity. As for others, such as the position of all circles under the blue sky and white sun flag. Having known that political orders are renewed. And not being reactionary elements. They also dare not not celebrate this New Year. Adding auspicious words. However, the auspicious words I have recorded. Do not overly exaggerate things. Nor completely beautify. Street talk and gossip. Women's words and children's sayings. This is certainly true public opinion. It can also be seen that our compatriots. Are rich in faith. Although the imperial system has been extinguished. But the thought of "comfort me as a ruler" is everywhere. Therefore, I am happy to record it. As something precious.</p>
<p>Auspicious Words from Naughty Children's Mouths Yesterday, I took a Route 1 tram to Hongkou. At the Risheng Building station. There was a six- or seven-year-old child. Who got on the bus with his parents. Sitting and standing restlessly. Sometimes peering outside the bus. Sometimes stepping on the shoes and socks of people on the bus. At a glance, one could tell he was a naughty child. However, when he heard people on the bus talking about the National New Year. He was very happy. Holding his mother's neck, he laughed and said. Good, good. The old calendar has leap months. Hoping for the New Year is as difficult as ascending to heaven. But now and hereafter. The New Year will really come easily.</p>
<p>New Character Prediction Zhu Zhu</p>
<p>Recently, at Old Muddlehead's place. I saw him predicting the two characters "Revolution". What he said made the general public. Hear and be encouraged. Therefore, I recorded it. As a New Year's Day wish for the twentieth year.</p>
<p>The character "革" (Ge, Revolution) is analyzed. Can be separated into the three characters "廿" (Nian, Twenty) "中" (Zhong, China) "一" (Yi, One). Meaning that after "Twenty" years. The National Revolution of "China's" people. Can be counted as truly "united".</p>
<p>The character "命" (Ming, Life/Fate/Command) is analyzed. Can be separated into the three characters "人" (Ren, People) "一" (Yi, One) "叨" (Dao, to receive favor). Meaning that the "People" of China. After twenty years. Can all "receive" "all" benefits.</p>
<p>New Drinking Game · Zhan · One · Smile</p>
<p>National New Year. Gathering around the stove to drink. For a dinner gathering of three people, A, B, and C. A new drinking game is played. Each person must say a four-character idiom that secretly relates to the twentieth year. Otherwise, they will be fined a large cup of wine. Everyone agreed. First, C was recommended. C said, "Four Cardinal Principles and Five Constant Virtues." Next was B. B said, "Crowning begins with learning etiquette." Finally, A said, "Upon reaching adulthood, one is given a courtesy name." Thus, everyone raised their glasses to congratulate.</p>
<p>The words were extremely unintentional. However, the girdle and finger guard. Are included in the Odes. Although the child is naughty. He is innocent. Therefore, it is ordered as the first auspicious word.</p>
<p>Auspicious Words from the Jealous Wife in the Boudoir. Last Monday. I attended a friend's birthday banquet. I heard a fun story from a guest. A guest had a relative, Mr. Zhao. Who lived with one wife and one concubine. They usually got along very well. And there were no quarrels. Recently, the wife suddenly said to her husband. The country has already adopted the Gregorian calendar. The expenses of all agencies have been revised. Our family should also comply. The husband also presented himself in the village autonomy. And happily agreed. Thus, the monthly allowance that you give each month. Will also be changed from the National Calendar from the New Year's Day of the twentieth year. Although this is using public office for private purposes to carry out her jealousy. However, the country's political orders. Extend to the boudoir. Therefore, it is ordered as the second auspicious word.</p>
<p>Auspicious Words from an Ignorant Teacher An ignorant teacher is in a precarious situation today. And will perish along with the old calendar. There is a Mr. Qu. Still using "Zhihu Zheye" (classical Chinese particles). Begging for food at the home of a wealthy household in a certain village in Suzhou. Hearing people say that the change of calendar is inconvenient for farming families. He said sternly. The sages of the Three Dynasties. And the tyranny of the Qin Dynasty. Changing the year and issuing calendars. The people all followed. Now, changing the calendar is also a story of everyone participating in the new. Why are there so many arguments? This was also told by a guest at the banquet. Although this kind of ignorant person is not appropriate in ethics. He also knows to follow orders. And can cite historical events. Among the ignorant, he is still better than others. Therefore, it is ordered as the third auspicious word.</p>
<p>New Year's New Game Qiushui</p>
<p>With the sound of firecrackers dispelling the old, today is New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic of China. Little brothers and sisters have nothing to do at home. I would like to offer a few new games as follows. Practice it on the spot. To entertain oneself. And to entertain others.</p>
<p>Although the new "Crossing Five Passes" game is a small game. It is not worth taking if it lacks profound meaning and strong interest. Old-style games. Although there are those that meet these conditions. But people get tired of them over time. It is human nature. Therefore, based on personal opinions and experiences. I will describe a new game of "Crossing Five Passes". The method is to first gather many people, big and small, male and female. Arrange chairs in rows facing each other. Leaving a considerable gap in the middle. The distance is such that the toes of those sitting opposite each other can touch. Once seated. Everyone touches each other's feet. Then choose two people (preferably one male and one female) to cover their eyes with towels. Order them to take steps forward. When those sitting see them walking. They gently withdraw their feet. The space between the two rows of people. Has suddenly become a wide road. But the blindfolded people do not know. And are still restrained. Unable to move an inch. The actions of the two people. Are very funny. If the blindfolded person knows that their feet have been withdrawn. When walking forward slowly. Those sitting in front. May as well stretch out their feet again. To make them somersault once. Or make a gold ingot shape. That would also be very fun. According to the process of life. There are many obstacles and dangers. If one is not careful in handling things. One cannot avoid falling. Those who engage in this kind of game. May be able to understand the true meaning of life from this.</p>
<p>Game Court The spirit of a country ruled by law. Lies in the ability of the people to understand the law. Legal education. Therefore, it must be promoted and popularized. The game court. Is one of the new games invented by me. Imparting legal knowledge through games. I think it will also be taken by those who know. When guests gather together. And the interest in chatting gradually fades. The game court can be held. First, ask a guest to voluntarily leave the seat. Once they are out. Then choose someone to be the judge. Sitting high in the courtroom. The guests then stand up one by one. Accusing the crimes of the person who left the seat. May as well use all kinds of tricks. And be as funny as possible. The judge takes notes. And records the names of the accusers. Once finished. Summon the person who left the seat. Tell them what happened. Ask them who accused them. If the accused guesses correctly. They will be released. And the person who was guessed correctly will replace them. The guest at the seat suddenly becomes a prisoner. That is also fun.</p>
<p>Today's Xie Gongzhan Individual Works Exhibition He Tianjian</p>
<p>Mr. Xie Gongzhan is one of the most ethical people in our painting circles. He has a long-standing reputation and his paintings are worth a lot of money. Now, on New Year's Day of the twentieth year of the Republic of China. He is holding an individual works exhibition on the third floor of the Ningbo Fellow Association. The meaning of this exhibition. I heard is to fulfill the agreement with his younger brother, Mr. Jiezhi, who died, and to commemorate him. Because the two brothers. Competed in playing the xun and chi (ancient Chinese wind instruments). And were known as Jiyuan at the time. And Mr. Jiezhi was especially good at writing lyrics. Whenever his elder brother completed a painting. He would write a clear poem on it as an embellishment. Which was spread as a good story in the art world. In recent years, Mr. Jiezhi felt that the trend of society. Was gradually leaning towards art. He strongly encouraged Mr. Xie to exhibit his lifetime works. To promote it. But Mr. Xie was dedicated to painting. And was always busy. And did not agree. Until Mr. Jiezhi died of illness this autumn. At the time of his death. He persuaded him again. And Mr. Xie was greatly moved. And his friends and relatives told him that Mr. Xie was crying for his brother day and night. And was about to get sick. They all advised Mr. Xie to quickly fulfill his brother's agreement. To engage in painting. Which could comfort the heart of the deceased and also dispel grief. Thus, this grand exhibition. With one hundred and seventy or eighty famous works. Was produced in this short period. Mr. Xie painted until late at night. Sometimes he even stayed up all night. Ink marks and lamp shadows. Often revealed spiritual realms. Pond spring grass. Came divinely from under his brush. There must be a reason for this. It is also heard that the works for this exhibition. Were originally set at one hundred and fifty pieces. But the number that has been ordered. Has exceeded the original amount and reached more than one hundred and eighty pieces. This shows the eagerness of the social people to admire Mr. Xie's works. However, the fairground must give people a new opportunity.</p>

<p>(In response to reward) Carrying on the Family Tradition Cao Mengyu</p>
<p>Four years ago. Under the lush and verdant Huanghuagang. There was often a haggard-looking man. Loitering and not leaving. Often until the sun set in the west. And the smoke from cooking began to rise. People still saw him lingering at the foot of the hill. As if there was something beautiful. Enough to hold his heart. And make him reluctant to leave. In fact, there was nothing fun about that hill. Few people usually went there. And no one regarded this hill as a scenic spot. So it was usually very quiet. Only this haggard-looking man was often seen.</p>
<p>Later, I met Chen Buping several times. And gradually became acquainted. Only then did I know that although he looked haggard. And seemed to be in his thirties or forties. In reality, he was very young. Only just over twenty years old. Chen Buping lived near Huanghuagang. After we became acquainted. I often invited him to sit at home. Because the two of us had similar interests. And our conversations were very congenial. Moreover, he was the son of Mr. Xiong, one of the seventy-two martyrs who were buried under Huanghuagang. His name was Xiong Ye. Buping greatly respected the seventy-two martyrs. So he loved the crow on the roof. And also valued Xiong Ye. But although our conversations were congenial. Xiong Ye refused to talk about his situation and purpose. The detailed history of the seventy-two martyrs is not clear to the world. Especially since Mr. Xiong's name is not even known to the world. Chen Buping asked Xiong Ye. But he did not say. Only talked about things that were not directly related to the martyrs. Xiong Ye also said. He had been deeply stimulated. And was tired of this world. And did not want to live in this world anymore. Buping was very surprised to hear this. And thought to himself. How could someone like him become so passive? Wasn't that strange? At the time, I did not want to ask in detail. And planned to slowly ask him to explain. Unexpectedly, Xiong Ye suddenly disappeared from Huanghuagang. And his whereabouts were unknown.</p>
<p>In an instant, two years had passed. In these two years. Chen Buping sometimes thought of Xiong Ye. Although we were not close friends. I still felt very concerned. And longed to see him. But he had been gone for two years. And I had not heard any news. He had said that he was tired of the world. Perhaps he was no longer in this world. Until last New Year's Day. Buping accidentally walked out of the house. And suddenly saw several people on the hill in the distance. When I went closer. One of them seemed to be Xiong Ye. Who had just finished worshiping at the tomb of the seventy-two martyrs. There was also a wreath placed on the tomb. And offerings of incense, flowers, wine, and food. This was also strange. Usually, no one cared about this tomb. How could someone suddenly come to worship on New Year's Day? The person who looked like Xiong Ye. Although his clothes were very plain. His face was very plump. Completely unlike the haggard person from two years ago. So I was skeptical. Who knew that Xiong Ye still recognized Buping. And quickly came over to shake hands and exchange greetings. Buping was overjoyed and said. "Why did you leave for two years. Without telling me? You must be successful now." When Xiong Ye heard the word successful. He suddenly looked sad and said. "What success are you talking about to me." After a pause, he said. "I originally wanted to have a good talk at your house. But my army is going to depart tomorrow. And I am very busy. So I cannot delay." Buping said. "Oh, you are indeed successful. May I ask what military position you hold now." Xiong Ye said. "I am just participating in the military staff. But my ambition is not to become an official. So I do not want to leave any traces of anything. I can only simply tell you. I want to carry out my father's ambition. My mother also often taught me. Not to be obsessed with forms and power. To be able to live like my father for the rest of my life. Would be considered as carrying on the family tradition. In the past, I thought that the trend was. It was not as good as before the birth of the Republic of China. When my father still had the opportunity to become a martyr. So I felt discouraged. Unexpectedly, there is still today. Which can make me and my mother feel a little comforted. And my father in the ground will also be happy. Today is New Year's Day. So I came to my father's tomb to report. However, although I am a little comforted. There are still many things that are not as I want. If I am not happy. My father in the ground will naturally not be happy. If I continue to work hard this year. And can do everything as I wish. Then next New Year's Day. I will still come here to silently report. At that time, we will have a pleasant conversation." These words. Buping seemed to understand. But also seemed not to understand. When I wanted to ask again. Xiong Ye had already left with the people who came with him.</p>
<p>Buping felt a sense of loss. After returning home. I missed Xiong Ye even more. Time passed quickly. And another year had passed. Buping thought to himself "This year. There has been much more progress than last year. Xiong Ye will always come to his father's tomb on New Year's Day. I must wait for him."</p>
<h3 id="e125">Newly Appointed Director of Zhejiang Education Department Takes Office Formally <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, Zhang Daofan, arrived in the province the day before yesterday, as previously reported in this newspaper. On the 29th morning, Mr. Zhang sent a letter from the West Lake Hotel to the Education Department's secretariat, informing them that he would arrive at the department at 1:00 PM to assume his duties. He instructed them to inform all sections so he could meet and speak with all staff at that time. At 12:30 PM, accompanied by two staff members, he walked to the department. Secretary Lin Duan assisted him in inspecting the various offices. At 2:00 PM, he convened all staff in the auditorium for an address, stating that the educational administration of the province, under the previous Director's ambition and progress, had achieved remarkable results, which had been commended by the Ministry of Education. Since there were established rules and procedures to follow, he would continue to adhere to them and work diligently. Any necessary improvements would be carefully planned and implemented to avoid being out of touch with the times. Director Zhang stated that he had always been determined to fulfill his duties, aiming for high goals, but the path to success lies in starting from the near and ascending from the low, and he did not want to engage in excessive discussions, lest he fall into empty talk without substance. According to past practice, whenever a new official takes office, the old staff would usually submit their resignations. If they truly believe they have fulfilled their duties, there is no need to follow this custom. After the address, he met with the various secretaries and section chiefs, inquiring in detail about various matters in the department's office. He also appointed Zhang Yiyang as the receiving officer to take over the general affairs and accounting matters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the new Education Director, Zhang Daofan, and the Construction Director, Shi Ying, held an inauguration ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 30th morning in the provincial government auditorium. Zhang Nanxian, sent by the central government, served as the oath-taking commissioner. After the ceremony was performed according to protocol, they were separately conferred with seals and took the oath. After the oath-taking commissioner delivered an address, Mr. Zhang responded by stating that he was not yet fully aware of the educational administration and financial situation in the province, and therefore dared not lightly propose plans. However, he emphasized that no matter what kind of undertaking, success requires collective effort, and he hoped that everyone would provide guidance at any time, and he would strive to realize it within the realm of possibility.</p>

The new steel-reinforced concrete school building, with two four-story buildings, was completed in the autumn of 1930. Due to the usual busy schedule of school affairs, there was little spare time. Now, taking advantage of the New Year holidays, the new school building inauguration ceremony will also be held.

<p>Jinan Team Sets Off Southward</p>
<p>|Starting on the 6th of this month, they will depart for the Philippines|</p>
<p>Amidst the festive sounds of the New Year and the celebration of peace and prosperity, the most exhilarating news is that the Jinan University football and basketball teams will depart south on January 6th to participate in the International Charity Grand Competition at the invitation of the Philippine Sports Association. Such a grand event is unprecedented in the nation, marking a new era in Chinese university sports. This journey is truly akin to being a "sports ambassador," and therefore, as they prepare to depart, we cannot help but offer our warmest wishes and hope that Jinan University will lead the way, and we eagerly await good news.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Principal Zheng's Farewell Speech <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Vast China, glorious Han people, possessing 400 million people, with a history of over 4,000 years, occupying 30 million square miles of land, but facing increasing foreign troubles and national humiliation. Shouldn't we, upon hearing the story of the ancients rising to dance at the crowing of the rooster and striking the oars in the middle of the river, resolutely rise up and strive forward? I remember that whenever our Founding Father thought of this, he would dance and shout to awaken the people. The legacy he left in people's hearts was to uplift the nation and eliminate all unequal treaties. To achieve this goal, it is essential to promote national physical education and revitalize the national spirit. Jinan University, the highest institution of learning for overseas Chinese, is also the only overseas Chinese education institution in the country that the Founding Father paid the most attention to. The school usually places great emphasis on student physical education. In recent years, the school's sports performance has been outstanding among universities in the country, but we always feel that we must continue to work hard and live up to the Founding Father's legacy. This spring, the school's football and basketball teams were invited by the Philippine government to participate in the National Sports Games at the Carnival. Before their departure, a special publication will be released. I believe that this event is extremely important for international friendship, and this friendship competition with a Chinese university team marks the first page in the history of Chinese sports. Moreover, our athletes are all children of overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese elders and youth in the Philippines want our school teams to participate in the competition to promote the martial spirit of our country, which is the focus of public attention and the aspiration of all hearts. I believe that our athletes are ready to depart, flying the banner of invincibility and living up to the enthusiasm of our overseas compatriots. This is a great event. However, I deeply hope that our students will not only display the skills and indomitable spirit of our school's teams in the Philippines but also demonstrate the thousands of years of benevolence and chivalry of our nation. That is what I deeply hope for. As for the people of that country and the overseas Chinese in the Philippines, it is hoped that they will provide assistance to our school's team in this trip, which is of great importance to international honor.
