<p>（日内瓦）今日國聨理事會授權白里安、與中日代表直接商榷、冀覓一解决滿案方法、白氏將與中國總代表施肇基日本總代表芳澤從事洽商、據聞國聨處理滿案上、今日將大有進步、理事會秘密會議係於上　午十時開會、至十一時半而散、現旣委白里安與雙方接洽、料下午當不再開會、今晨之會、中日代表仍未出席、美代表則照舊列席、聞各理事現謀修改解决方式、冀能爲中日所接受、不必再有公同討論與激烈之辯論、今日芳澤將中國人民　抗日方案、尤其長江流域各地　之抗日方案、撮述大要、分送各理事、竟指爲具有敵對行爲、違反國際、條約之文字與精神云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<h3>國聨行政會昨開秘密會議</h3>
<p>討論解决爭端步驟</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨理事會原定星期上午召集公開會議、現因接日政府政式照會、重提美國參加之法律問題突於今夜决定展緩舉行、而於星期上午改開秘密會議中日仍不出席按日政府照會係日代表芳澤於今日下午送達白里安、現由理事會决定授權白里安答復日政府、理事會於今晨十一時開秘密會議、至十二時五十分散會、白里安於散會後語人、局勢已轉入佳境、渠希望國聨之努力、可有迅郚進展云云、今旣接日本照會、恐又將幾纯會商之後、方能再有公開會議也現此間多希望歷次秘密會議所苦心策劃之方法、或能爲解决中日糾紛之發軔點、俾可打開僵局結束滿案、據美聨社消息、今日秘密會議中曾决定下屆公開會議内、不提出任何其　提議、僅説明中日間局勢之甚爲嚴重、請中日代表各宣布其在解决爭執上所爲之行動、并將由白里安詳述理事會目前之努力、倘不能獲得中日兩國自動保證滿案之可以不日和平解决、則理會將提出預擬之計劃、適宜保證日本撤兵至滿鐵附屬地、一面由中國適當擔保保護日僑生命財産、但中日雙方須俱受國聨所派之監視員之節制、而此監視員尤當特别注意中國之保護日僑步驟、此外又要求中日允諾尊重現行條約、連授予日本在滿特權之條約在内、并要求中日擔保將由直接外交談判、求得最後解决云、（十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）過去四十八小時數度秘密會議結果、决定明日午後公開集會、以冀解决滿洲問題之僵局、今夜據可靠方面消息、明日公開會議如中日兩國間仍無圓滿解决辦法、則理事會將援用國聨會章或非戰公約採取强硬行動、茲悉明日會議席上、白里安將以理事會長資格、正式要求施肇基及芳澤報告中日政府對於數星期前國聨勸告撤兵之態度、雙方代表如無滿意之答復、則公開理事會將立即散會、重行秘密會議、考慮國聨應取態度、以及决定嚴厲辦法、今夜更據日方消息、明日　會時、芳澤仍將堅持日本反對美國正式參加理事會之主張、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨行政會原定今晨舉行公開會議、　論滿洲時局、但臨時改開秘密會議、中日兩國代表皆未與會、公開會議之展期、因日本來文不願贊成美代表參加行政會討論、今晨國聨須答覆之也、日軍撤回至鐵路區域之時期、雖尚未决定、但此事當然爲行政會討論之點、完全撤兵、三星期似可認爲充足、查九月三十日行政會休會時之時期、曾决定停會十四日、如日軍在此期内已退出佔據地點、而中日直接談判業已進行、則行政會可無須復開、限令日軍退入鐵路區域之時期、則迄未决定、日人欲行政會了解滿洲之實際難題、現已將覺書一通送交行政會、説明此種困難、覺書頗長、謂日本雖接日僑請求、迄未派兵深入滿洲内地、日本甚欲撤兵、但中國現有之反日空氣、先必平息、否則事態或將更劣、又謂中國與國聨雖有保障滿洲日僑生存之諾言、但日政府不能撤兵過早、致使日僑生命冒險云、覺書措詞和緩、已造成此間良好空氣、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<h3>國聨擬要求日本限期撤兵</h3>
<p>日代表芳澤表示反對</p>
<p>引英國派兵來渡事冀淆觀聽</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表因預料理事會將要求日本規定日期、完全撤兵至滿鐵附屬地以内、而由中國保護日僑生命財産、故今日悍然發聲明書、表示日軍將佔據中國領土、一時不即撤退、内稱、日本雖尊重中中國保護日僑生命財産之擔保、但仍懷疑此項担保實質上之可能性、最近曾覩華人對於日兵與日僑有違反不抵抗情事、故日本疑惑苟日軍撤回之後、恐國聨亦將不能保證日僑之保護也、日本認在考慮撤兵上必須有兩預侙步驟、（一）中國軍隊勿對日軍有敵視行爲、（二）中政府與地方長官尊重日本條約權利、日本以爲時局之樞紐不在撤兵、而在中國採用一種態度、俾予日僑以安全與平安、聲明書末段妄引英國派兵至租界事、冀淆惑觀聽、聲稱、當一九一一七年鼓吹排英時、英國僅在上海一埠派兵一萬五千人、今日遇同情勢、僅派一萬四千人、保護一萬二千公哩之鐵路與日僑生命財産云云、（十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（東京）傳説國聨行政會現提出要求、（一）日本須於三星期内將滿洲境内之日軍撤回至南滿鐵路區域、（二）一星期内在中立國視察員以前與中國開談判、以此間現象察之、日本未有依允此項要求之表示、今日官塲且謂日本對於國聨行將發來之上述辦法、全不能接受、又據今晨可恃消息、内閣已决定日本無論如何、不退出國聨、日本似以爲國聨有此决議、乃不充分了解滿洲情形所致、又據日内瓦消息、目前佈置、係星期日行政會公開會議聽取中日雙方之陳説、然後草擬解决紛爭之方式、是以在星期五日以前、行政會未必能結束也、日政府發言人説明日本拒絶日内瓦提議之理由、謂日本以爲談判問題與撤兵問題、截然爲兩件事、故日政府不依允國聨將兩事混而爲一、因混爲一事、則直謂日本之佔據鐵路區域外地點爲錯也、至於在談判時派中立視察員之提議、雖鱯案談判時、曾有此前例、但今之滿洲問題、與昔之山東問題完全不　、因日本於田中首相執政時、曾在一九二七年夏間向列國宣言説明日本不容外人干涉滿洲事件、亦不容危及滿洲日人或外人生命財産之騷擾、如今日所有者是、若在未獲關於法律與秩序之滿意擔保以前撤退日軍、則此種騷擾、定將復見云、（十九日國民社電）</p>

<p>事機迫切不容齗齗於法律</p>
<p>（日内瓦）行政會議長已答覆日本星期反對美代表與會之來文、略謂國聨全體會員皆以爲便宜的理由、决不使國聨會章　違反爲合理、但渠已愼重研究十月十五日日代表來函所舉之理由、並希望同日覆書已銷释日人對於國聨所採方法之疑念、邀請美國旁聽員之决議、僅欲完成業已着手之佈置、以便利行政會消息之</p>

<p>山河依舊國事日非。今日京粤諸要人於重復聚首一堂之際顧念當前之國難民困，廻溯北伐以來政局之滄桑變幻。誰爲爲之。孰令致之。黩念之頃。吾人敢料定諸要人，始必相持痛哭。繼乃破涕作笑。即我全體人民處於今日情勢之下。聆此和平統一有望之之佳音。亦不五自禁悲喜交集笑啼俱非。　　悲者何。自國民黨北伐底定全國而後。五年於茲。人民飽受革命過程中之痛苦。而今則更内困洪水。外迫强鄰。存亡之機。線絲屬。忽怱五載。每况愈下。處於今日情勢之下。悵望來日之大難。吾人不得。不悲從中來。而莫可自抑。喜者何。和平之會。今已即將召集諸要人旣抱和平統一共救國難之熱忱而來上海。則今後國民黨諸領袖庶幾其能悔禍自贖。精誠合作。國民黨庶幾其能刷新其機能發揮其偉力本偉大之三民主義。領導全體人民。爲新中國闢出廣坦光明之前途念此吾人又覺希望未絶。光明正多。而欣喜隨之。然而未來茫茫。何可逆測證諸曩昔。未必能遽容吾人十分樂觀。以故在今日情勢之下。悲歟喜歟。實又令吾人深感啼笑不得。啼笑皆非之苦悶。</p>
<p>此種苦悶應亦即爲國民黨全體領袖今日共有之苦悶。假使國民黨諸領袖在今日最後時機。而有悔禍之誠意。則當可以斷然之决心。打破當前之苦悶以懺悔之血涙洗滌過去之罪愆以奮鬥之精神實現主義。振興我國家與民族。</p>
<p>國以民爲本。人民無所謂［絶望。］當其絶望之日。即其新希望展開之時。民意無常。當全國人民宣告對政治絶望之日。亦即爲現實政治將呈突變之時其於今日主政之國民黨如斯其於任何政黨亦如斯。</p>
<p>民苦深矣。民望切矣。主政之國民黨。刷新其機能。發展其偉力。以拯民水火。解國危困。今即爲千載時之機。吾人本野人獻曝之義。當於過去糾紛之癥結。以及今後爲政之正軌。本其所見。依次申述。藉爲今日切謀和平統一之國民黨諸領袖他山之一助。</p>

<p>敎育消息特載</p>
<h3>抗日救國聲中敎育上應有之設備（二）盧紹稷</h3>
<p>（四）注意科學敎育　夫科學不振則實業不興、而民生凋敝、又科學不振則民智不開、而迷信不除、再科學不振、則軍械不精、而防衞不固、我國今日國貨之所以不多、與其所以不能對日一戰者、類皆由於科學敎育之不注重也、故今後敎育、一·應極力提倡科學知識之輸入、二·應注意實騐室之工作、三·應注重國貨之製造、四·應注意新式軍用機械之製造與應用、</p>
<p>（五）實國際敎育　世界交通、今已發達、一人不僅爲國家之公民、且爲世界之公司、敎師對於學生、固須使瞭解本國之國情、更須使瞭解國際間之形勢、國人此次抗日、夢想［國際聨盟會］之主持公道者、實由於不知該會爲列强共同壓迫弱小民族之組合也、故今後敎育、一、須使學生研究國際間之形勢、如［太平洋問題、］凱洛克非戰公約之内容］、與列强對於此次事件之關係及態度等、二、須使學生研究我國應取之方策、</p>
<p>（六）禁止殖民敎育　此爲列强對其殖民地所實施之一種特殊敎育、其宗旨、不在授與被敎育者之知能、乃在用敎育方法、使其忘却　有之文化而守全同化於征服國、例如英國人對於印度人所施之敎育、祇在設法將印度人變成英國人、以如日本人對於朝鮮人之敎育、祇在設法將朝鮮人變成日本人、皆是殖民敎育、日本在我國南滿及山東、早已設立許多殖民學校、一方盡力鼓吹其學校去侵略中國、一方又盡力敎中國人要卑視本國文化、效忠日本帝國、日人此次用種種詭計、鼓吹滿洲獨立者、即欲用此種敎育之手段、併吞我土地也、故我國政府、對於此種敎育、應嚴厲禁止、同時、亦須通令本國人不得送其子女至其所開之殖民學校肄業、</p>
<p>國人皆已認清此次［瀋陽事變］、是中華民族反抗外力壓迫長期奮鬥之開始、實爲中國前途之一線生機、然吾人現在欲執干戈衞祖國、則不能不實施、［軍事敎育］與［科學敎育］、欲使民衆皆有國家觀念、與國際常識、則不能不實施［民衆敎育］與［國際敎育］、欲雪除當前之國恥、則不能不實施、［國恥敎育］欲使全國同胞不至受日人之欺騙、則不能不禁止、［殖民敎育］、又欲振興實業增加生産、以挽回利權、更不能不注重［科學敎育］、［武力自衞］、［全民革命］、［振興實業］、［雪恥圖强］······等、皆爲中國當前之重要問題、蓋非如此、則决不能使内奸絶跡於今日、外侮潛銷於他時、而不負東北死難同胞之犧牲、故六種敎育、俱爲瀋陽慘案後敎育上應有之設施、爲現今中國之對症下藥、願敎育界同人、幸勿河漢斯語、（完）</p>

<p>劉海粟歸國後報告敎育部書（二）</p>
<p>海粟於文藝復興時代之研究、生一段落後、即入於第三階段上之研究、先自意大利探求勃羅克Ｂaroquo藝術之來歷、折回法京、考求西班牙·佛蘭特·荷蘭各邦勃羅克藝術之流布、先後挑定如拉伐喬Ｃaravagio蘭尼Ｒeni加拉契Ｃaracci格蘭柯ＥＬ　Ｇreco委拉斯快士Ｖelazqeuz魯本斯Ｒubens　雷百朗特Ｒembrandt等之作品、爲研究對像、於此時期因風氣之轉移、而佛蘭特、荷蘭幾爲一代中心、海粟欲推究轉移之原由、於是年秋間赴比利時、歷勃吕舍勒·盧文·盎凡斯各地·研究佛蘭門派之繪畵、而追溯哥蒂克時代發見由畫之王哀克Ｖan　Eyck、下而及於勃羅克時代之魯本斯、王迪克　ＶanDyck、以及後期作家之製作、乃知十八世紀風氣轉移、自有其歷史背景、蓋近代國家成立之後、各自有中心化之區域、各有宗敎生活之型式、而特殊之藝術風格、因以形成、是年冬間歸法京、從事於自勃羅克至羅可可、又自羅可可至古典派推移之研究、擇代表作者博桑Ｐoussin華篤Ｗafteau布歇Ｂouchel逹維Ｄavid歌牙Ｇoya等爲研究對象、此時期之研究、在海粟觀察文藝復興時代及十九世紀之後而下手、於源委之尋繹、進路之展望、皆暸如指掌矣、綜十七十八兩世紀、由富麗寛裕的形式而入於靡侈濃膩、乃時代生活之平直而細分發展之反映、趣味之歸向、集中於宫庭證諸歷史、益形明顯、</p>
<p>海粟於此三階段之研究、雖略成起迄、但猶未饜足、蓋因近代藝術上、北方之一領域、尚未履及之故、於是二十年春、復赴德國、觀覽此方文藝復興之大師丢拉Dilrer之作品、以及十八世紀佛蘭特荷蘭作家留存於德國之作品、乃得略以彌補此次之缺憾、旋返法京、將二年半以來攻究之筆記圖譜爲最後之整理、此關於研究方面之經過情形也、</p>

<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>親愛的國人。我們上蘇州去遊虎邱時。走到千人石上。不是總能記得［生公説法頑石點頭］的一篇神話麽。頑石原是無知無覺的東西。而聽了生公的説法也會點頭。不料自命世界文明之國的日本。竟還不如一塊頑石。國際聨盟邀請美國列席。共同效生公之説法。而日本這塊特别在頑石、却始終不爲所動。國人啊。我們如今正好似被壓在這一塊特别大頑石之下。動彈不得。我們該如何的使出全身的力量來。推倒這頑石。搗碎這頑石。一雪數十年來被壓之恥。</p>

<h3>陶知行的顔色</h3>
<p>去年陶知行以勾結叛逆的罪名被中央通緝。這叛逆大概是指馮玉祥。西北軍的制服是藍色。通緝令下首都即有藍色知行之封號。胡展堂在立法院演講，獨説他是國家主義派，突然將一身國粹黨的黑衣罩在他身上。過了幾個月，曉莊學生中有十幾個共産黨被捕，於是陶知行赤化之風聲，傳遍都下。這時展堂給他那件黑衣服也立刻變爲通紅了。朋友們不放心屢屢問他説：你究竟是藍色，是黑色，是紅色？］他説：［我一樣也能否認。我的靜脈是藍的：我的頭髮是黑的；我的血是紅的。］</p>
<h3>日本近二百年文化之功臣</h3>
<p>— 王紹曾</p>
<p>日本古倭奴國。唐咸亨初。改日本。以近東海日出而名也　。］［地環海。惟東北限大山。有五畿七道三島。］（明史日本傳）考中日間兩國關係。萌芽於秦漢。極盛於隋唐。親善於五代兩宋。决裂於元。擾亂於明。有清以來。侵略迄無寗日。於日國人稍稍注意日本之文化。蓋日本之於朝鮮。僅隔對馬海峽一衣帶水耳。故其文化之觀摩取法於中國者十之九。當唐之盛。尤其著也。然日本自明治維新。轉弱爲强。一日千里。百務並修。罔遺餘力。待宣光之世。一戰勝中。再戰勝俄。席捲琉球台灣。鯨呑朝鮮南滿。以島洲小國。一躍而爲世界强國之一。尤以科學昌明。朝發歐洲。夕行日本。益奮力而不倦。論者莫不推其全功於科學救國。而不知近二百年文化之勃興。實得我明季大儒朱舜水先生敎化之力爲多也。舜水先生名之瑜。字魯璵。浙江餘姚人。明諸生。與王陽明。黄梨洲。世稱爲餘姚三大學者。開歷史上稀有之盛况。舜水與梨洲同時。實爲陽明之再傳弟子。故服膺於知行合一之敎尤深。余常聞太倉唐蔚芝師道其爲人。而同學朱君公束。又爲先生鄉人。故聞之益詳。當崇禎末。先生兩奉徵辟。</p>

<p>何物桓景反避災。登高陟險太怱忙。長房之言詎可信。安知雞犬未潛藏。茱萸旨酒屺仙靈。何能相敵神權强。迺知古來多造作。文字紀載殊渺茫。况值紅葉經霜艶。東籬菊綻黄花黄。寒香四溢沁人鼻。風吹朶朶吐芬芳。昔有不淵明處其間。酌酒沈醉未能忘。睹茲令節非易事。往往風雨滿城揚。今歳天公雖做美。灼人烈日出扶桑。遑云及時行樂矣。朝野上下都驚惶。何問王勃能作序。何問題糕有劉郎。試看地勢東南陷。西北高矗隔津梁。媧皇補天不補地。今年洪水殊泱泱。摶土爲六水爲五。三分高嶺接穹蒼。涉彼山兮徒費力。巨靈擘地　鴻荒。君不聞喜馬拉耶最高巔。縱有亥步未能詳。元龍豪氣千萬丈。張目四顧天低昂。胸吞天下十八九。一覽脚下衆山藏。不知高低無定形。今昔那可憑較量。不見飛機能直上。天空之間如鳥翔。俯視下地渺且小。休言人類徒皇皇。須知立　身貴乎卑。樹高則風戕。處世宜持平。騰躍走且殭。大風兮泱泱。大潮兮滂滂。不優則劣兮。不興危乃亡。物競天擇無能逃。强隣逼處環其傍。儻得高山可避災。此日大地盡遭殃。吾謂迷信最欺人。無意無識眞杳茫。即看東隣肆暴虐。遼天鋒鏑放光鋩。大家勢力能自衞。一雪奇恥在康莊。百仞之臺平地起。不在五獄向朝陽。只要一心和一德。煌煌標語貼高牆。在乎民衆速自覺。豈其權力在中央。吾賦斯篇欲飛舞。霎時盪氣又廻腸。</p>
<p>福王時以薦授江西按察副使。皆不就。清兵陷南都。依黄斌卿於舟山。乞師日本。旣許而師不果出。舟山陷。遂轉輾日本交趾間。旣而往來於張煌言。陳煇軍。事敗。重赴日本。日本水户滯主德川氏待以國師之禮。然乞師之舉終不就。遂講學於日本。而鬱鬱以没。於是日本研究中國理學之風大開。朝野上下。咸相敬服。而知行合一之敎。亦遂大倡於日本。而日人［知而行之］之心理。乃牢固而不可拔。迄今王陽明學説研究之著述。已不下數十百種。反觀我國書肆。欲救陽明全書之佳板而不可得。遑論其他。竊今日本有如此之民族精神。要不得不歸功於先生。此則日本史家。亦無不公認者也。先生精研六經。學無不通。獨有復明之志。未遂報國之願。卒致流落異邦。楚材晉用。其志苦。其節高矣。然自先生没後。二百有餘年。而日本之藐視中國威逼無已。思先生之高風亮節。能不慨然於懷。濟南慘劇。遼東血涙。又豈先生所逆料也哉。今有舜水文集行於世。日本學者私謚文恭先生。（移酬助賑）</p>
<h3>受矮累</h3>
<p>— 陸士方</p>
<p>吾崑民諺有［受矮累］一語。余初不知何本。嗣讀邑乘。始悉此語由來。實對倭奴而發。蓋倭本有矮人國之稱。當明嘉靖時。倭宼猖獗。侵擾江浙沿海各縣。蘇松一帶。備受蹂躪。吾崑亦在被擾之列。倭宼自寳山海塘登陸。長驅直入。絡繹城下。縣令聞訊先時閉門。又嚴縋城之禁。小民斗米束菜。悉爲吏卒所苛取。近郊之人。扶老携幼。望門而呼。城上莫有應者。惟坐視其宛轉於賊之鋒刃下。且曰鈎取疑似之人。以爲賊諜而屠刳之。蓋寃苦無訴之民。有不獨死於賊手者矣。然苟非倭奴之侵入。何至受此无妄之災。余讀歸震川先生别集。見有海上紀事詩。爲倭宼之亂而作。其一云。［海上腥膻不可聞東郊殺氣日氤氲。使君自有金湯固。忍使吾民餌賊軍。］殆即詠此事。此民間　定思痛。所以有［受矮累］之諺。相傳至今也。今則倭奴奪吾東三省。刦殺姦淫。無所不至。吾國人之受矮累。更非昔比矣。</p>
<p>又考邑志。倭宼之役。吾崑有同知任某。守備梁某。一則奮勇殺賊。一則聞風潛逃。震川先生又有詩詠其事。辭嚴義正。深得詩人褒貶之旨。茲特節錄二首於後。彼守土之將吏。敵至束手受制。甘心委　疆土。而事後猶襲取不抵抗之美名。以欺朦國人者。不知讀歸氏之詩。其亦有愧於中否耶。</p>
<p>詩曰。［海島蠻夷亦愛琛。使君何苦遞逃深。逢倭自有全身策。消得床頭口萬金。］［輕裝白裕曰提兵。萬死寗能顧一生。童子皆知任别駕。巋然海上作金城。］</p>
<h3>記青島日兵忠魂碑</h3>
<p>— 南宫生</p>
<p>青島於遜清時。租借於德人。經營不遺餘力。蔚然成大觀。歐戰起。日人</p>
<h3>過鄭州雜記（下）</h3>
<p>— 狄建庵</p>
<p>天氣在冬臘極冷。現時着棉衣。前數日尚着單衣。寒暖變化甚速。雨水甚少。恒數月不雨。灰沙甚多。如遇刮風。則不便出門。因灰沙隨風而起。目難張視。恒至對面而不能見也　。古跡如城内有周世宗陵裴晋公墓。縣西北有周勃墓。縣東有東湖鳳凰台。名勝有隴海公園及烈士祠。物産有麥高梁棉花棗子芝蔴花生雅梨杮餅等。其中尤以棉花爲大宗。陜西豫北之棉。均以</p>
<p>鄭州爲散集市塲。每年約計有一百五十萬擔以上。今歳豫省棉産尚稱豐收。聞現時估計有七十萬擔左右。而陜西尚未計及焉。此間棉商與江南稍有不同。花行計有十四家。多爲仲買商。其營業爲引領各方售客商。一面接洽辦貨廠商或花號。以居間買賣。故無須多大之資本。惟近年來有資本者亦有預先貸欵於售貨者。則棉花登場時。其生意範圍較大。轉運公司異常發達。營是業者有五六十家。堆棧業亦稱發達。妓院林立。咸在河北沿一帶。聞竟有二三百家。蘇帮本帮均有。考其發達之由。蓋以鄭州爲交通要隘。四方來往客商麕集。故是業亦因之而興。金融機關有中國中央上海交通金城各銀行。分設支行於此。尚有本地銀號。（不稱錢莊）市上通行紙幣。爲中央中國交通四明四家。其他頗不適用。尚有河南農工銀行。發行銅元票。分十枚二十枚五十八一百枚四種。大洋一元可兌換四千八百文。銅元亦有四種。爲二十文五十文一百文二百文四種。零星兌換所。均設在露天。置在一鉛絲籠内。一人守之。余每喜指此號之小錢莊爲在島籠内也。紗廠有豫豐紗廠。在車站之東。曾去參觀。有紗錠五萬五千隻。該廠停工已久。方於本月二日開工。現開錠子二萬。此後將陸續開齊。有噴水池。頗有可觀。其故因機器必須用水。而鄭地無河流。故特築故因機器必須用水。而鄭地無河流。故特築一池以容水。置噴水管無數。蓋從噴水管噴出之後。容而變冷。而復有所用也。旅館有金臺迎賓館天保老棧法國飯店等十餘家。鷄價頗廉。每隻祇三角左右。但其重量亦祗一二斤耳耳</p>
<p>即乘德人不能東顧之時。興兵犯青島。欲奪爲己有。青島爲我國領土。非德人所有。雖經租借。其領土權自仍屬於我國。日人以擊德人爲名。而奪我國領土之青島。其侮辱我國之國權可見。德人守青島。因砲台之優良。軍士之梟勇。器械之精利。日人雖大舉進攻。卒不得逞。於是破壞我國之中立宣言。竟於龍口上岸。由陸路攻青島。其時我國祇宣言中立。未曾加入協約國也。日人以欲奪我青島。又破我中立。其對於我國國威。自視若無覩。後德人退。日人遂佔青島。而戰死者頗衆。乃立忠魂碑。以瘞日兵遺骸。迄今青島收歸我國。而忠魂碑已皇皇然兀立於我國領土中矣。以一國領土之中。而有他國之忠魂碑。巍然而存。可恥爲如何哉。</p>
<p>碑在匯泉砲彈附近。有曲徑通行。約半里許。一碑高七八尺。上鐫忠魂碑三大字。其旁歷叙當時攻青島之功蹟。與夫死者之姓氏人數。碑後一墳堆起。以石爲頂。工程浩大。築成時。固需數月之工程也。其中所瘞。則爲抱有侵略野心。欲佔據我國領土。日人視之。爲唯一愛國健兒之遺骸。而我國視之。則無一而非不共戴天之大仇敵也。</p>
<p>日人之對於忠魂碑。慕敬特甚。每一兵艦抵青時。皆至碑前行禮。其心中之敬崇。無可比擬。在我國未接收青島時。每逢春秋二季。青島領事。必率居留日人。行禮致祭。自迫於華府會議。交還我國。此禮漸廢。然日人每至碑前。莫不行其最恭敬之大禮。其愛國心之表現。於此可見。視我國爲如何哉。</p>

<h3>敲夢的杵（一八）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>［中國的　質文明，近來大有進步了。］建築家趙梅亭瞻仰着兩旁房屋而發這議論。</p>
<p>［假使世界的物質文明，都有日新月異的進步，而中國獨否；那麽，外國的觀察團，一望便知這是没有進步的國度。照我趙梅亭的主張，國家　的是體面，都市鎭村掙的是容顔！譬如像這條馬路，和兩旁房屋的建築，是不錯的；但是，全國的建築和這裏不相上下的，恐怕只有最少數中的最少數，那就不能替國家挣扎體面了！我們研究建築的，宛比擴大手段的整容匠；一切的一切，都要從整理都容市容鎭容村容入手！必須都有都容，市有市容，鎭有鎭容，村有村容：才能夠替國家掙扎體面，才能夠和世界各國並駕齊驅於　質文明的軌道上。不經破壞，不能夠建築；那些不合建築方式的房屋待道橋梁，須得一古腦兒犧牲於整容匠的擴大薙刀之下。］</p>
<p>［實行你的整容論。須得有一個先决問題！］思想家錢蘭軒開端提出這句話，以下又有他的一番議論：</p>
<p>［什麽先决問題呢？譬如要替那人整容，須得把那人的身體治好了，才行！要是丨那人的身子未離病房，你便天天替他整容，也是枉然！整容固然是緊要　治身尤其是緊要中的緊要，丨丨這便呌做先决問題。村鎭所害的是盜賊徧地的病，須把盜賊消滅了，才能夠整理這鎭容村容；要是不然村鎭被盜賊佔據了，枉自化了許多建築費，結果却替盜賊整容。都市所害的是隄防不堅的病，須把隄防鞏固了，才能夠整理這都容市容；要是不然，都市被洪水淹没了，枉自化了許多建築費，結果却替河伯整容。］</p>
<p>［蘭軒兄的議論，也不是個先决問題！］陶遲忽的發這辯駁的論調。</p>
<p>［據我陶遲的主張，先决之中，又有先决，便是一個自衞的方法。譬如一個人，身子醫治的健全了，容貌整理的潔凈了；便是，没有自衞的方法，也不免有許多危險！依着蘭軒兄的議論，眞個盜賊消滅了，隄防堅固了，都，市，鎭，村，都有相當的建築了；然而，零星盜賊消滅了，整個盜賊没有消滅；國内隄防堅固了，國際隄防没有堅固；那麽千辛萬苦積日累月經營而成的建築物，結果只是［爲他人作嫁衣裳］罷了！我們要保全我們的錦繡河山，和那千辛萬苦積日累月經營而成的建築物，非和人人有軍國民資格人人能一致對外……］</p>

<h3>League of Nations Situation Improves</h3>
<p>The Executive Council Authorizes Briand to Negotiate with Chinese and Japanese Representatives</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations Council authorized Briand to directly negotiate with Chinese and Japanese representatives, hoping to find a solution to the Manchurian issue. Briand will engage in consultations with Shi Zhaoji, the chief Chinese representative, and Yoshizawa, the chief Japanese representative. It is reported that significant progress will be made today in the League of Nations' handling of the Manchurian issue. The Council's secret meeting was held at 10:00 AM and adjourned at 11:30 AM. Now that Briand has been appointed to contact both parties, it is expected that there will be no further meetings this afternoon. The Chinese and Japanese representatives were still absent from this morning's meeting, but the American representative attended as usual. It is reported that the Council members are currently seeking to modify the method of resolution, hoping that it will be acceptable to both China and Japan and avoid further public discussions and fierce debates. Today, Yoshizawa summarized the main points of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese plans, especially those in the Yangtze River basin, and distributed them to the Council members, even accusing them of hostile acts that violate the letter and spirit of international treaties. (Nineteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning's non-public meeting of the Executive Council lasted only one hour and adjourned at 10:30 AM. It is reported that the atmosphere is much better than before, and real progress is being made in determining a method. However, the specific deadline for the Japanese army to withdraw into the railway zone has not yet been agreed upon. The Japanese memorandum seems to be intended for the press rather than the Executive Council, and it has created a very good impression. The belief that the Japanese side's attitude is now more moderate and that a satisfactory solution to the Manchurian problem can be achieved has become stronger. President Briand will meet with representatives from China and Japan today to seek agreement on the method. The German representative has received news from China stating that the Shenhai Railway has been opened to traffic and that Japan has abandoned its intention to send marines to land at Dalian. The time of the next meeting of the Executive Council is currently unknown. (Nineteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Reuters has learned that the Japanese delegation has proposed a five-point plan to resolve the Manchurian issue. The content has not been disclosed, but if agreed upon, it would avoid direct intervention and satisfy Japanese public opinion. This plan, along with the method proposed by the Executive Council, will be the basis for discussions this afternoon. It is believed that one of the five points involves China building a railway parallel to the existing Shenyang Railway. A possible solution to this difficulty may be found in the joint management of this railway by China and Japan after its completion. (Nineteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Executive Council Held a Secret Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing Steps to Resolve the Dispute</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council was originally scheduled to convene a public meeting on Sunday morning, but due to receiving a formal note from the Japanese government raising the legal issue of American participation, it was suddenly decided tonight to postpone the meeting and instead hold a secret meeting on Sunday morning. China and Japan will still not attend. According to reports, Japanese representative Yoshizawa delivered the Japanese government's note to Briand this afternoon. The Council has now decided to authorize Briand to respond to the Japanese government. The Council held a secret meeting this morning from 11:00 AM to 12:50 PM. After the meeting, Briand told people that the situation has turned for the better and that he hopes the League of Nations' efforts can make rapid progress. Now that the Japanese note has been received, it is feared that several rounds of consultations will be needed before another public meeting can be held. There is much hope here that the method painstakingly planned in the previous secret meetings can be the starting point for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute, so as to break the deadlock and end the Manchurian issue. According to the American Associated Press, it was decided in today's secret meeting not to raise any other proposals in the next public meeting, but only to explain the seriousness of the situation between China and Japan and to ask the Chinese and Japanese representatives to announce their actions in resolving the dispute. Briand will detail the Council's current efforts. If automatic guarantees from both China and Japan that the Manchurian issue can be resolved peacefully soon cannot be obtained, the Council will propose a pre-arranged plan, suitably guaranteeing Japan's withdrawal of troops to the South Manchurian Railway Zone, while China provides appropriate guarantees to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. However, both China and Japan must be subject to the control of supervisors appointed by the League of Nations, and these supervisors should pay particular attention to China's measures to protect Japanese residents. In addition, it also requires China and Japan to promise to respect existing treaties, including treaties granting Japan special rights in Manchuria, and to guarantee that a final solution will be sought through direct diplomatic negotiations. (Nineteenth National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) As a result of several secret meetings over the past 48 hours, it has been decided to hold a public meeting tomorrow afternoon in the hope of resolving the deadlock in the Manchurian issue. According to reliable sources tonight, if there is still no satisfactory solution between China and Japan at tomorrow's public meeting, the Council will invoke the League of Nations Covenant or the Kellogg-Briand Pact to take strong action. It is learned that at tomorrow's meeting, Briand, in his capacity as President of the Council, will formally ask Shi Zhaoji and Yoshizawa to report on the attitudes of the Chinese and Japanese governments towards the League of Nations' recommendation to withdraw troops several weeks ago. If the representatives of both parties do not provide satisfactory answers, the public Council will immediately adjourn and reconvene in secret to consider the attitude the League of Nations should take and to decide on strict measures. News from the Japanese side tonight further indicates that at tomorrow's meeting, Yoshizawa will continue to insist on Japan's opposition to the United States formally participating in the Council. (Eighteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council was originally scheduled to hold a public meeting this morning to discuss the Manchurian situation, but it was temporarily changed to a secret meeting. Representatives from China and Japan did not attend. The postponement of the public meeting was due to a letter from Japan unwilling to support the American representative's participation in the Executive Council's discussion. The League of Nations must reply to this this morning. Although the timing of the Japanese army's withdrawal back to the railway zone has not yet been decided, this matter is certainly a point of discussion for the Executive Council. A full withdrawal in three weeks seems to be considered sufficient. When the Executive Council adjourned on September 30, it was decided to adjourn for 14 days. If the Japanese army had withdrawn from the occupied areas and direct negotiations between China and Japan had commenced during this period, the Executive Council would not need to reconvene. The deadline for ordering the Japanese army to withdraw into the railway zone has not yet been determined. The Japanese want the Executive Council to understand the actual difficulties in Manchuria and have submitted a memorandum to the Executive Council explaining these difficulties. The memorandum is quite long and states that although Japan has received requests from Japanese residents, it has not sent troops deep into the interior of Manchuria. Japan very much wants to withdraw its troops, but the current anti-Japanese atmosphere in China must first be calmed down, otherwise the situation may worsen. It also states that although China and the League of Nations have promised to guarantee the survival of Japanese residents in Manchuria, the Japanese government cannot withdraw its troops too early, lest the lives of Japanese residents be put at risk. The memorandum's wording is moderate and has created a good atmosphere here. (Nineteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Plans to Demand that Japan Withdraw its Troops by a Deadline</h3>
<p>Japanese Representative Yoshizawa Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>Hoping to Confuse the Audience by Citing the British Sending Troops to Dalian</p>
<p>(Geneva) Because the Japanese representative anticipated that the Council would demand that Japan set a date to completely withdraw its troops to within the South Manchurian Railway Zone and that China would protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, he boldly issued a statement today stating that the Japanese army will occupy Chinese territory and will not withdraw immediately. It stated that although Japan respects China's guarantee to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, it still doubts the substantial possibility of this guarantee. Recently, Chinese people have been seen violating the policy of non-resistance towards Japanese soldiers and residents. Therefore, Japan is doubtful that even if the Japanese army withdraws, the League of Nations will not be able to guarantee the protection of Japanese residents. Japan believes that there must be two prerequisite steps in considering the withdrawal of troops: (1) The Chinese army must not engage in hostile acts against the Japanese army; (2) The Chinese government and local officials must respect Japan's treaty rights. Japan believes that the crux of the situation is not the withdrawal of troops, but that China adopts an attitude that provides Japanese residents with safety and security. The final paragraph of the statement recklessly cited the British sending troops to the concessions, hoping to confuse the audience, claiming that when anti-British sentiment was incited in 1911-1917, Britain sent only 15,000 troops to Shanghai alone. Today, facing the same situation, it has only sent 14,000 troops to protect 12,000 kilometers of railway and the lives and property of Japanese residents. (Nineteenth National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is rumored that the League of Nations Executive Council has now put forward the following requirements: (1) Japan must withdraw its Japanese troops within Manchuria back to the South Manchurian Railway Zone within three weeks; (2) Negotiations with China must begin within one week, with neutral observers present. Judging from the situation here, Japan has not indicated that it will comply with this requirement. Officials here said today that Japan cannot accept the above-mentioned measures that the League of Nations is about to issue in any case. According to reliable news this morning, the Cabinet has decided that Japan will not withdraw from the League of Nations no matter what. Japan seems to believe that the League of Nations' resolution is due to an insufficient understanding of the situation in Manchuria. According to news from Geneva, the current arrangement is for the public meeting of the Executive Council on Sunday to listen to the statements of both China and Japan, and then draft a method for resolving the dispute. Therefore, the Executive Council may not be able to conclude the matter before Friday. A spokesperson for the Japanese government explained the reasons for Japan's rejection of the Geneva proposals, saying that Japan believes that the issue of negotiations and the issue of troop withdrawal are two completely separate matters. Therefore, the Japanese government does not agree with the League of Nations combining the two into one, because combining them into one would directly state that Japan's occupation of locations outside the railway zone is wrong. As for the proposal to send neutral observers during negotiations, although there was a precedent for this during the Shandong negotiations, the current Manchurian issue is completely different from the former Shandong issue. Because Japan, under the leadership of Prime Minister Tanaka, declared to the nations in the summer of 1927 that Japan would not allow outsiders to interfere in the Manchurian incident, nor would it allow disturbances that endanger the lives and property of Japanese or foreigners in Manchuria, such as those that exist today. If the Japanese army withdraws before obtaining satisfactory guarantees regarding law and order, these disturbances will definitely recur. (Nineteenth National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Replies to Japanese Memorandum</h3>
<p>Stating that Inviting the US to Participate Does Not Violate the Charter</p>
<p>The Situation is Urgent and Cannot Tolerate Legal Disputes</p>
<p>(Geneva) The President of the Executive Council has replied to Japan's letter from Sunday opposing the participation of the US representative, stating that all members of the League of Nations believe that the League of Nations Charter should not be violated for expedient reasons. However, he has carefully studied the reasons cited in the Japanese representative's letter of October 15 and hopes that the reply of the same day has dispelled Japanese doubts about the method adopted by the League of Nations. The resolution to invite an American observer is only intended to complete the arrangements that have already been started, in order to facilitate the exchange of information to the Executive Council. The legal issue does not arise and should not be reserved for later. He believes that legal research on the current non-applicable difficulties will not help the matter. (Nineteenth Reuters Telegram) (Geneva) The Japanese memorandum also involved the anti-Japanese movement in Manchuria, stating that in 1927, Britain was forced to send troops to land in Shanghai under the same circumstances. The Japanese delegation also sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, describing the anti-Japanese movement in the Yangtze River and other places in China, accusing the Chinese authorities of publicly engaging in hostile acts and violating the spirit and letter of international treaties. Chinese newspapers are currently conducting intense anti-Japanese propaganda. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association has detained many Chinese merchants who have violated the ban, and three people have been sentenced to death. Japanese consulates and Japanese residents in many places have been forced to withdraw due to intimidation. (Nineteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The news tonight is more unfavorable. The Executive Yuan has formally notified that the public meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed and replaced by private talks. The Executive Yuan's postponement of the meeting seems to be due to Japan's dissatisfaction with the decision to withdraw troops unconditionally. This morning, Briand met with Shi Zhaoji and asked Dr. Shi to submit a memorandum outlining China's views. The memorandum advocated unconditional withdrawal of troops and has been published in various newspapers. Japan also published a very long opinion paper this afternoon, detailing the relationship between China and Japan and reiterating its views on the various points published by this agency yesterday (i.e., the legal issue of American participation, whether a majority vote or universal passage should be used, and whether countries that signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact should participate equally). Although the tone was moderate, the meaning was very firm. The Japanese delegation is now working tirelessly. People here generally regard Tokyo's strong opposition to the Executive Yuan's resolution to invite the United States to attend as a fallacy of Japanese policy. Japan's memorandum to Briand expressed displeasure with the United States. It was initially thought that this was just to appease Japanese public opinion, but given the postponement of the Executive Yuan's public meeting, this explanation is somewhat doubtful. The so-called "final reservation" in the Japanese memorandum has a threatening meaning. Whether this threat will materialize is still uncertain. The memorandum also raised two questions: (1) If the United States is a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and is invited to attend, should the other signatories be invited as well? (2) Now that the principle issue has been reserved, when can a decision be made, and will this decision affect the vote of 13 to 1? Briand replied to Yoshizawa, stating that the United States has expressed a special interest in the actions of the League of Nations and has previously explained that this can be referred to. As for the legal issue, it can be studied at a later date. (Eighteenth Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Dares Not Withdraw from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>The Seiyukai Holds a General Meeting of Assembly Members</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As the actions of the League of Nations Council are gradually becoming more significant, at the Cabinet meeting on the 19th, Foreign Minister Shidehara reported in detail on the progress of the Council meeting. After exchanging views with each other, they unanimously agreed that the Council's activities would definitely not develop in a way that was favorable to Japan. However, Japan absolutely cannot suddenly withdraw from the League of Nations at this time. Therefore, it should do its best to maintain its position in the current situation and seek the understanding of other countries. (Nineteenth Japan Union News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Passing the full text, and should all countries that signed the Non-War Pact, whether or not they were the same, should participate in the various issues.) Reiterate their argument, though the tone is gentle, but the wording is very firm, at this moment the Japanese delegation is even more diligently struggling, people here are focusing on Tokyo's exhaustion to oppose the resolution of the Executive Yuan to invite America to attend and read, all kinds are seen as mistakes in Japanese policy, the Japanese presented to Briand's note, showing displeasure towards the United States, at first it was still thought that this was only to relax Japanese public opinion, but looking at the open meeting of the Executive Yuan being delayed, this kind of explanation makes people inevitably suspect, The Japanese note called one last reservation, and there was no lack of threatening meaning, whether this threat will be seen in practice, is still not necessarily, the note also presents two problems, (1) If the United States is a signatory to the Kellogg Pact and is invited to attend, then should the other signatories be invited together, (2) Now that the principle problem has been reserved, then when can a decision be made, and does this kind of decision have an impact on the voting case of thirteen votes to one, Briand answered Yoshizawa, that the United States has expressed a special interest in the actions of the League of Nations, has previously explained that it can refer to, as for the study of the legal problem, it can be waited for another day.

<h3>Japan Periodically Convenes Meetings of Senior Statesmen</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to decide and express the party's will and direction on this major situation, the Seiyukai held an emergency meeting of representatives staying in Tokyo at its headquarters at 2:00 PM today. Secretary-General Kuhara gave the first speech, severely criticizing the failures of the current Cabinet's domestic and foreign policies, and stating that the current Cabinet cannot be allowed to take on this major situation. Next, President Inukai gave a speech on the Seiyukai's overall direction in relation to the situation. Finally, it was resolved that the party should, based on the main points of the President's speech, further consolidate unity at this time and bravely advance to save the situation. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Inukai's speech was roughly as follows: Since the Manchurian incident occurred, our party has always exercised patience and self-respect to this day in order to sufficiently invigorate the current Cabinet's abilities. However, the situation has gone against expectations, and foreign relations have become increasingly chaotic. National disasters have now reached our doorstep. The country has reached a critical autumn, and we must temporarily set aside all differences and rush to the rescue. At this time, faced with the crisis of the rights and interests that came from wagering the country's fate on Manchuria, and the lives of 1.2 million compatriots being taken away, we should eliminate the distinction between the government and the public, and between the military and civilians, and unite as one to deal with it. We must resolutely follow the right path and move forward. There is no other way. The world's nations, all those who truly know the history of Manchuria in recent times, and those who question existing treaties, will definitely not make a mistaken judgment about this matter. This is what I believe. (Nineteenth Japan Union News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the views expressed by a certain quarter today, Japan's seemingly stubborn attitude towards the various resolutions of the League of Nations is largely in the nature of a delaying tactic, so that the League of Nations can understand and recognize Japan's points of contention.

<h3>Japan Collects International Propaganda Materials</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) News from Shenyang: Japan is currently sending commissioners to Manchuria to investigate and collect evidence of what it claims are incidents of Chinese troops and officials violating Japan's special rights in Manchuria, which will be used as the basis for the investigation committee report during future Sino-Japanese direct negotiations. It is reported that their work is nearing completion. It is claimed that since 1929, there have been 7,000 incidents of interference in the South Manchurian Railway. In addition, there have also been a considerable number of incidents of what they claim is abuse of Japanese residents. Japan is now planning to release a list to the world in the near future of all the suffering it believes it has suffered at the hands of the Northeast Army and officials of China.

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary</h3>
<p>The Last Opportunity for the Kuomintang's Rebirth (1)</p>
<p>In the face of the perilous situation of intertwined domestic and foreign troubles, and the precarious state of the nation, the people of the whole country unanimously hope for an early end to internal strife and the early realization of peaceful unification, so that countermeasures can be determined early on. This is as urgent as hoping for rain during a great drought. Now, the Cantonese representatives Wang Jingwei and Sun Zhesheng are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tonight to attend the meeting to resolve the current situation. Nanjing's Yu, Wu, Li, and Li Jishen are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning. After a month of running around, appealing, and negotiating, the difficult unification and peace conference can be formally convened in the near future. The long-awaited and earnestly wished-for peaceful unification can also be achieved at this time. Therefore, what the major figures from both Beijing and Guangdong are bringing with them today can be said to be not only a sign of peaceful unification, but also a glimmer of hope for the survival of our country and nation's future.</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers remain the same, but national affairs deteriorate day by day. Today, as the major figures from both Beijing and Guangdong gather together again, remembering the current national difficulties and the people's hardships, and looking back on the vicissitudes of the political situation since the Northern Expedition, who is to blame? What caused this? At this moment of reflection, we dare to predict that the major figures will first hold each other and cry bitterly, and then break into smiles through their tears. Even our entire people, in today's situation, hearing the good news of the hope for peaceful unification, cannot help but be filled with mixed emotions of sorrow and joy, laughter and tears. What is sorrowful? Since the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition settled the whole country, five years have passed. The people have suffered the pain of the revolutionary process, and now they are further troubled by internal floods and pressured by strong neighbors. The opportunity for survival is hanging by a thread. In these five years, the situation has deteriorated with each passing day. In today's situation, looking forward to the great disaster to come, we cannot help but feel sorrow from within and be unable to restrain ourselves. What is joyful? The peace conference is now about to be convened. The major figures have come to Shanghai with the sincere hope of peaceful unification and jointly saving the country. Then, the Kuomintang leaders will perhaps be able to repent, redeem themselves, cooperate sincerely, and the Kuomintang will perhaps be able to refresh its functions, exert its great power, and, based on the great Three Principles of the People, lead the entire people to open up a broad and bright future for a new China. Thinking of this, we feel that hope has not been cut off and that there is much light. Joy follows. However, the future is vast and unpredictable. Based on the past, we may not be able to be fully optimistic. Therefore, in today's situation, whether it is sorrow or joy, we deeply feel the pain of not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>This kind of pain should also be the common pain of all the Kuomintang leaders today. If the Kuomintang leaders have the sincerity to repent at this last opportunity, then they should break through the current pain with a firm determination, wash away the sins of the past with repentant blood and tears, and realize their ideals and revitalize our country and nation with a fighting spirit.</p>
<p>The country is based on the people. The people have no such thing as [despair]. The day they despair is the day their new hope unfolds. Public opinion is fickle. The day the people of the whole country declare despair of politics is also the day that the current politics will present a sudden change. This is the case for the Kuomintang in power today, and it is the case for any political party.</p>
<p>The people's suffering is deep. The people's hopes are urgent. The Kuomintang in power must refresh its functions, develop its great power, and save the people from fire and water and relieve the country from its dangers. Now is the opportunity of a lifetime. We, in the spirit of a humble villager offering his simple advice, should base our views on the crux of past disputes and the correct path for governance in the future, and use them as a help for the Kuomintang leaders who are earnestly seeking peaceful unification today.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Run Rampant in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since occupying the eastern provinces, the Japanese have been running rampant and unchecked.

(19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Yizhe Meets with Zhang to Report on Troop Deployment</h3>

<h3>A Glimpse of Public Opinion in Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Russian newspaper Pravda commented on the League of Nations' invitation to the United States to participate, saying that this invitation proves that the conflict between imperialists is becoming increasingly fierce and will inevitably turn the Sino-Japanese conflict into a U.S. conflict. The resolution of the League of Nations' Administrative Council is no different from saying that under environmental pressure, world imperialism is now simultaneously planning to take advantage of U.S. imperialism's interests, but not in accordance with its plan, to mediate the partition of China. The Manchurian entanglement is now gradually tightening. The imperialists' struggle for the Manchurian fat will develop into preparations for the next imperialist war to divide and occupy the new world order. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to newspaper opinions, the current situation has not yet cleared up, and the reputation of peace and the League of Nations depends on a satisfactory resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Furthermore, if the reputation of the League of Nations is indeed diminished, its impact will inevitably be significant. Le Matin reported that the members of the Administrative Council have a sense of being caught in a dilemma. Whether true peace or legal peace can be maintained depends on the withdrawal of Japanese troops or allowing them to continue occupying certain locations. The Administrative Council should implement a temporary attachment and have it managed by an international committee. Once order is restored, the committee should guide both sides to negotiate so that the established management system can legally obtain a basis. In addition, the inclusion of U.S. observers on the Administrative Council does not pose any coercion or disadvantage to Japan. All newspapers have stated this. Socialist Party newspapers such as Le Populaire and Le Peuple reported that if Japan continues to insist, more persuasive methods must be adopted so that it understands that international ties cannot be recognized by one party and denied by the other. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today's editorial in the Paris Daily News stated that Japan's attitude is based on misunderstanding and that this misunderstanding must be dispelled quickly so that the Sino-Japanese dispute can be resolved by the public ethics of all parties. Le Matin stated that the League of Nations has been shaken by a very great crisis, and there has also been no conflict between the necessary measures of written law and goodwill. This is undeniable. However, the League of Nations was initiated by the United States, so the League of Nations' intention to bring the United States into the League is most legitimate. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>A leading article in this morning's London newspaper, The Manchester Guardian, said that if Japan resolutely rejects any resolution of the League of Nations, it will be resented by the signatories of the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The legal points raised by Japan to oppose the presence of U.S. observers are merely evasions. Anyone who truly respects the League of Nations Charter cannot oppose the temporary presence of a representative from a country that drafted the League of Nations Charter. Does Japan recognize accepting the resolution of the League of Nations? If so, President Hoover will certainly recall his representative. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Postal Situation in Northeast China Under the Oppression of Violent Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to postal circles, all post offices under the jurisdiction of the Liaoning Postal Administration have been forced by Japanese soldiers to hoist the Japanese flag, and more than ten soldiers have been stationed at each post office.

<p>(Nanjing) The Special Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting at 11:00 AM on the 19th at the Central Conference Hall. All committee members in Nanjing attended and continued to study the issue with Japan. They adjourned after 12:00 PM. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Receives Representatives of Northeast Chinese People Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Representatives of the Northeast Chinese people, Che Xiangchen and others, went to the National Government to call on Chairman Chiang on the morning of the 19th and were received. In addition to detailing the atrocities of the Japanese army in the Northeast, they made the following requests: (1) Denounce the illegal organizations and governments established in Liaoning and Jilin and the secret agreements they have signed, and strictly order the arrest of Yuan Jinkai, Xi Qia, and others. (2) The final solution to the issue with Japan should be resolved by force. (3) After peaceful unification, a national defense policy should be planned. (4) Restore diplomatic relations between China and Russia. (5) Please order the Heilongjiang provincial troops to stop Zhang Haipeng from advancing north.

Apart from Li Jingbi staying in Nanjing to contact various parties, the representatives went to Shanghai in the afternoon to connect with anti-Japanese organizations and expand publicity.

<h3>American Advisor to the National Government, Lewis, Reports on the Situation in the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Lewis, the American advisor to the National Government, went to Manchuria for investigation and has sent a report from Qingdao stating that the Japanese army in Manchuria is now making every effort to consolidate the key areas they have occupied, from Korea to Mongolia, including Jilin and Taonan. The Japanese are now mobilizing Mongolian princes to establish an independent government under Japanese protection. The Japanese army has cleared out all Chinese administrative organs in key areas and occupied the reserves, ledgers of various companies, and large quantities of industrial and military supplies of major Chinese banks. Japanese telegraph and power plants will be expanded and replaced by the Chinese ones. The Japanese army now manages the Chinese telegraph and telephone bureaus and inspects mail at Chinese post offices. The Japanese army now manages the Beining and other railways. On October 14th, the Japanese army occupied the Chinese Mining Bureau, causing 15,000 people to lose their jobs.

<h3>Li Jishen and Others Arrive in Shanghai to Greet the Guangdong Committee</h3>
<p>Jiang Ding Departs from Nanjing Tonight by Train</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Jishen, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Shao Yuanchong, Li Shizeng, and others are all traveling to Shanghai on the night train of the 19th to greet the Guangdong Committee and discuss peace issues. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Jishen, accompanied by Wu Zhihui, attended the memorial week at the National Government on the morning of the 19th. After the meeting, he followed Jiang into the Chairman's office for a conversation lasting about half an hour, making some contributions regarding the current situation. This was Li's first visit to the government since assuming the post of National Commissioner. As the Guangdong representatives are coming to Shanghai together, Jiang will also go to Shanghai within the next few days to have frank discussions. This is a good opportunity for a great unity of all comrades within the party. It was decided to go on the night of the 19th to participate and discuss the great plan for national salvation. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the afternoon of the 19th, a reporter visited Li Jishen in Toutiao Alley. According to him, this time, comrades within the party, in view of the increasingly urgent foreign aggression, are trying their best to unite, and the situation is extremely good. Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke and others have already set off from Hong Kong and will arrive in Shanghai soon, and Jiang will also go. This morning, I was summoned with my younger brother and Mr. Wu to visit Jiang at the National Government to discuss peace matters. Jiang has great sincerity for peace, because with the national crisis at this point, if the country is not united again, how can we resist foreign aggression? Therefore, he believes that peace is not a problem and will definitely succeed. Regarding the Japanese issue, my personal opinion is that, from the perspective of a military person, protecting the country and its people is an unshirkable responsibility, and it is not necessary to consider whether we can win or not. If we fight and lose, China is certainly in danger, but Japan may not necessarily benefit. The European wars of the past, such as Turkey, Romania, Belgium, etc., were all devastated, but in the end, justice triumphed over power, and they recovered and strengthened themselves. This is a precedent. At this time, if we rely solely on the League of Nations, it is absolutely unreliable. Because the League of Nations and the United States, if they do not have the determination to fight Japan, can only make fairly fair proposals and will certainly not bear much responsibility. Therefore, we should still seek unity ourselves, seek ways to deal with the situation ourselves, and strive for survival in hardship and difficulty, so that we can overcome difficulties.

<h3>Thomas Edison's Remains Laid to Rest</h3>
<p>National News Agency, West Orange, 19th: The remains of Thomas Edison, the great inventor, were moved from his home today to the funeral home for encoffining. Afterwards, they will be displayed in his laboratory, along with his scientific books and mineral and plant specimens, for mourning. A public memorial service will be held for two days, Monday and Tuesday, and the funeral will be held on Wednesday.

This was revealed by Dr. Howe, who was attending to him. Howe also told reporters that Edison was clear-headed and cheerful in the hours before his death, thinking of posterity. Edison said to those around him, "Whether there is an afterlife, I do not dwell on it." One day, Edison sat comfortably in a chair, apparently dreaming, and suddenly opened his eyes and looked up, smiling and whispering, "Beautiful is the place."</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Jilin Has Become a World of Terror</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Arbitrarily Kill People; Commerce is in a State of Utter Depression Tianjin Correspondence: According to a person from Jilin (who left Jilin on the 13th), the Japanese troops occupying Jilin have become increasingly violent recently. Starting yesterday, they suddenly claimed that plainclothes soldiers had infiltrated and conducted a large-scale search inside and outside the city. Two Chinese people were shot dead in the commercial port area outside the city, one being a Mr. Tian, the person in charge of the Linjiangchun Restaurant, and the other's name is unknown. When the Japanese soldiers entered the courtyard to search, Mr. Tian greeted them wearing his clothes. As soon as he bent down to take off his shoes, the Japanese soldiers thought he was making some move and shot him dead with one shot. From 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, all the city gates were closed and not allowed to enter or exit. More than 40 Chinese people were arrested between the Jilin-Changchun Railway Station and the kiln pits, forced to kneel in a circle on the bank of the water inside the kiln pits, with a small half forced to kneel in the water. After an hour, the Japanese soldiers waved their hands and left. At the intersection of the three districts of the provincial capital, a police chief was shot and wounded. Recently, Japanese soldiers often buy things without paying, and merchants dare not argue with them, but have to recognize their bad luck. A few days ago, in Dongdatan in the third district, a Japanese soldier suddenly became bestial, pulled a woman and forcibly kissed her cheek, and touched her abdomen, saying, "There is a child." Passersby looked askance, but there was nothing they could do.</p>
<p>Since the 11th, the Japanese army has conducted artillery exercises in Dongdatan for seven consecutive days. The sound of cannons can be heard in the early morning, firing about 200 rounds a day. Yesterday, many Japanese officers dined together at the Huadong Simple Canteen in the city and said to the Chinese people, "This war must resolve the issue of Manchuria and Mongolia and establish a continental policy. Russia and the United States are not enough to be our enemies. We will never withdraw our troops before this issue is resolved. The</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The face of the Japanese Empire is important. The League of Nations cannot do anything about it," and so on, their arrogance being so great.</p>
<p>In recent days, the situation in Jilin City has filled the merchants with fear and resentment. Although the surface seems calm, the reality is very different. The Japanese army arbitrarily searches the people and injures many people. Once this news spreads, people are even more shocked. Since the 12th, there have been very few pedestrians in the city. After 8:00 PM, it is even more silent. As a result, large and small shops have been greatly affected, especially bookstores. In normal times, bookstores such as the Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company can sell several hundred yuan a day, but now they only sell two or three yuan. Businesses that have closed down due to losses are heard of every day. In previous years, major silk houses were purchasing winter goods at this time, but this year, due to the lack of exchange and the inability to circulate silver dollars, they have not purchased them. Moreover, the value of Yongyang, Hanyang, and official notes has been plummeting, and prices have been soaring, making it impossible to control. Although the puppet government is forcibly suppressing it, merchants, with their capital at stake, can only passively refuse to sell. Yesterday (12th), the Hanyang dollar fell sharply again to 278 strings, a difference of 19 strings per dollar compared to the previous day. It is rumored that this is because the provincial government will be moved to Harbin, but it is not known for sure. In short, it is a fact that the current exchange rate of each Hanyang dollar is only 57 or 58 cents in silver dollars, and credit has been greatly reduced compared to before. Because each silver dollar is worth more than 450 official strings, but the market rate is 375 strings, so there is nowhere to buy spot goods. As a result, the society in the provincial capital is stagnant, and people generally have a sense of living day to day, thinking that the future is unpredictable. Recently, rumors have become even more rampant, and major public offices and wealthy people are digging cellars to prepare for the worst. People are panicked, knowing that disaster is imminent.

<h3>Shenyang Almost a Den of Devils</h3>
<p>Japanese Soldiers and Koreans Indiscriminately Harass the People</p>
<p>Market and Financial Panic Abounds</p>
<p>Jin County Correspondence: Since Shenyang was invaded and occupied by the Japanese army on the 18th of last month, more than twenty days have passed. The people, unable to endure the oppression of violence, have fled one after another. Commerce has stagnated. Those who have left deeply rejoice in escaping the tiger's den, while those who remain are in dire straits, barely surviving. Because all transportation facilities have been occupied by the Japanese army, communication with the outside world has been cut off. All information transmitted is one-sided propaganda from the Japanese. The true situation remains unknown. Our reporter made a special trip to Shenyang on the 11th to investigate, staying for three days. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Deployment of Japanese Troops: The reporter traveled east from Jin County. From Dagushan to Xinmin, a state of complete anarchy prevailed. Bandits were rampant, and the Japanese side was even funding them to rob and harass travelers. Japanese soldiers were stationed at the Julu River station, and trains traveling to and from the station were subjected to strict inspections. Few passengers were traveling east, and the searches were especially harsh. A certain Mr. Jia on the train, unaware that Japanese soldiers had boarded to inspect, angered them and was beaten. He had to kneel and beg for mercy before they stopped. Travelers who witnessed this scene, those with any spirit, all glared with rage, but being under the power of brute force, they dared to be angry but not speak out. Trenches had been dug along both banks of the Liao River, and sandbags were piled up at key points. Japanese soldiers wearing copper helmets and holding guns stood guard. Heavy mines were buried at the 59th Railway Bridge (the Japanese railway authorities stated that they would not interfere with passenger train operations). Passing through Xinglongdian and Masanjia, Korean farmers could be seen working in the fields, harvesting rice. Japanese soldiers were stationed in the ticket office and stationmaster's office at Huanggu Tun station. The nearby Tiantai Inn was also occupied. Passersby dared not look directly at their menacing presence. Various government agencies within the city, such as the Department of Finance, the Governor's Office, the Guards' Pistol Battalion, the Marshal's Mansion, and the South Manchuria Railway Company, as well as the residences of important figures in the commercial district, such as Zhang Zuoxiang, Tang Yulin, Ji Jinchun, Wang Yizhe, and Zhu Guangmu, were still garrisoned by Japanese troops. Sandbags and defensive structures were piled up in front of the gates, and trucks with the words "Kwantung Army" were parked there. Laborers carried wooden objects from inside to the Japanese station. Honjo Shigeru, who had transformed from the "Commander of the Kwantung Army" to the Commander of the Japanese Army, was currently stationed on the upper floor of the East Asia Development Company building at the Japanese station. The headquarters of the military police remained in the Telegraph Administration Office opposite the imperial palace. To avoid attention, only one soldier stood guard at the entrance, with the rest remaining indoors. Sometimes large groups of armed soldiers paraded, and sometimes they patrolled on bicycles. Their movements were erratic. Currently, the total number of troops stationed in South Manchuria was one division, distributed across the north and south of Sipingjie. Other organizations, such as veterans and youth groups, had already been disarmed and returned to normal, but were still under orders to be ready to mobilize at any time.</p>
<p>Market Situation: The number of residents who have fled has been extremely crowded on the North-Ning and South Manchuria Railways until recently. It is estimated that three-quarters of the total population of the city have left. During the day, there are very few pedestrians on the streets, mostly laborers. Shops have not yet officially opened. Small shops only open their bottom doors, with windows and boards still tightly closed. Large businesses, due to the poor business, cannot sustain themselves and have closed down one after another, temporarily suspending operations. The Japanese army, except for the locations where they are stationed, does not care about any other order. They also allow Koreans to run rampant, resulting in rampant banditry. Gunfire erupts every night. After 6:00 PM, the roads are deserted. Japanese soldiers hide in the sandbag piles at the intersections, opening fire on anyone they see, killing them without mercy. Consequently, news of people being harmed is heard every day. Many citizens have dug cellars and sleep in them at night to avoid stray bullets. Currently, nine out of ten households in the entire city are empty, which is extremely tragic. However, the prices of rice, flour, and mountain vegetables have fallen because supply exceeds demand. Hotels have posted signs of drastically reduced room rates, but no one is interested. Only the small inns near Huanggu Tun are making ten times their usual profit because travelers must spend the night in Huanggu Tun waiting for the train. Large residences are first searched by the Japanese army for valuables, then looted by Koreans, and finally robbed by ordinary poor people. Therefore, the current situation in Shenyang is one of extreme panic. The rich have become poor, and the poor have become bandits. The Japanese aim is for our country to be in chaos, so they not only do not try to maintain order but also encourage it. Currently, opium dens, brothels, and gambling dens are openly rampant in the city. The Japanese side also sends people to collect donations. Each branch post office has two Japanese people checking letters, and a Japanese flag is hung in front of the door.</p>
<p>Yuan and Others are Passive: Since Yuan Jinkai and others organized the Public Safety Maintenance Association, all municipal affairs have been handled by the association, which has been exploited by the Japanese side. Yuan is currently passive due to criticism from public opinion and avoids matters, but the Japanese side is urging him urgently to take over various government agencies, otherwise they will threaten to send free people to run them. After the Maintenance Association took over the tax bureau, the Japanese side immediately sent personnel to preside over the bureau, with the power in the hands of the Japanese. After Ding Jianxiu (a well-known pro-Japanese figure) was appointed as the manager of the Shenhai Railway by the Maintenance Association, the Japanese side also sent several consultants. The same happened with the Official Bank and the Bianye Bank. As a result, the Maintenance Association realized that it had been deceived by the Japanese side, so it dared not lightly agree to all their demands again.</p>
<p>Honjo is Barbaric: The Japanese government has lost the ability to command its soldiers. Honjo Shigeru is acting willfully. Recently, the Japanese government telegraphed to summon important leaders in Manchuria back to Japan to discuss the policy for this incident. Uchida Kosai, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, and Hayashi Kyujiro, the consul-general stationed in Shenyang, have been summoned back to Japan. It is said that Honjo alone resisted the order. Judging from the various announcements posted in Shenyang, his arrogance and the distribution of various absurd leaflets, his attitude is barbaric. The Japanese overseas community speaks out. Since the Shenyang Incident, the Japanese side has telegraphed to overseas merchants in various places to gather in Shenyang. Many of them, supporting the old and carrying the young, shed tears and could not bear to leave suddenly. According to a certain Japanese overseas merchant who returned to Shenyang from Jin County, the people want to live and work in peace and do not want the government to engage in such acts of war, causing displacement and dispersal. This shows a glimpse of the resentment of the Japanese overseas community. (15th)</p>
<h3>US Commissioner Inspects the Situation in the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening News, Shenyang, 19th: The commissioner sent by the US government to inspect the situation in Manchuria, after continuing to inspect Yingkou, Niuzhuang, Andong, and other places, returned to Shenyang yesterday. In the afternoon, he sent a confidential telegram to Washington to report the true situation he had obtained. Because the Chinese telegraph lines were cut by the Japanese army, and the radio stations were occupied by the Japanese, this telegram had to be sent to Peiping via Japanese telegraph lines, and then relayed to Washington by radio. A copy was also sent to US Ambassador Johnson in China and the US Embassy in Tokyo. The US commissioner is currently awaiting orders to go to Jinzhou for inspection. However, since the military attaché of the US Embassy has already gone to Jinzhou to investigate the Japanese bombing situation, it is unlikely that there will be any further orders for the US commissioner. Today, the US commissioner is inspecting Japanese military activities near Shenyang, including the place where the South Manchuria Railway was bombed, as pointed out by the Japanese side, and the Beida Camp, where 300 Chinese soldiers and workers were killed. The US Deputy Naval Attaché in Peiping, White Lang, the US Consul in Shenyang, Vincent, and three investigation commissioners from the British Embassy in Peiping are traveling with him, accompanied by many Japanese officials. The US commissioner is currently staying at the Kening Hotel, which is run by Germans. If the US government has no new orders, his original mission is expected to be completed tomorrow. The content of the report is kept strictly confidential, but judging from the reactions in Washington and Geneva, the report must have mentioned the opinions of foreign expatriates in various countries in Manchuria, believing that the poor political situation in the Eastern Provinces and the delay in handling outstanding cases have inevitably angered the Japanese people, which is the main reason for the Japanese military's actions this time. However, although China may deserve a reaction, the Japanese military's aggressive and violent actions have gone beyond the scope and destroyed all governing power, creating an abnormally chaotic political and economic situation, which is even worse than the original situation that the Japanese claimed to be trying to correct. The Manchuria Daily in Dalian, the official newspaper of the Japanese government, today published the revised management regulations for the Official Bank and the Bianye Bank. The restrictions on business operations are even stricter. The banks are not allowed to transact with any business or people that the Japanese military considers hostile. Without the permission of the Japanese military, no important transactions or changes in personnel are allowed. The Japanese military has the right to enter and inspect at any time, and has the right to suspend its operations at any time. It is also stipulated that no large amounts of cash can be stored in branch offices. Citibank here has withdrawn 275,000 yuan in cash from Bianye Bank, but there are still 200,000 yuan deposited in the Official Bank, and the Japanese do not allow withdrawal. Citibank's manager, LeCraine, has protested to the Japanese authorities through the US Consul for failing to provide adequate police protection for the bank's premises, as the bank's premises are located in the Chinese quarter and are currently maintained by the Public Safety Maintenance Association, which is under the orders of Mr. Shifeiyuan, the Japanese acting mayor. It is reported that Chinese people here are withdrawing their deposits from Chinese banks and depositing them in foreign banks here and in Tianjin, and some are converting their Japanese yen deposits to US dollar deposits.</p>
<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Weeks</h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM on the 19th, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week for Sun Yat-sen. More than 600 people attended, including Kong Xiangxi, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, Wu Jingheng, Fang Juehui, Yu Jingtang, Chen Guofu, Chen Bulei, and Ding Weifen. Ding Weifen chaired the meeting. Wu Jingheng reported briefly that the 20th year of the Republic of China can be considered a year of natural and man-made disasters, internal and external troubles. Every memorial week has passed in the midst of storms. This week, the outside is still a storm, but the lights in our broken house suddenly shine brightly, so we can smile through our tears. The ancients said, "Many hardships revive the nation." Now it can be said that things have reached the extreme and are turning around. This national salvation conference, before the foreign troubles started, everyone was aware. Our emperor has this intention, and the comrades in the south have a bright belief, expressing that they do not want a settlement of old scores. The meeting proved that the various speculations outside were completely wrong. Everyone wants to realize the meeting, how to complete the period of political tutelage, this is the real national salvation conference. The issue of peace is not a problem, Mr. Wang has also said, it is not a problem of peaceful reunification, but how to save the country. This is enough to show that this bright light will not dim again. Speaking of diplomacy, the League of Nations is still a dark cloud, with no light. Some ambitious people despise the League of Nations, and there is a risk of collapse. So it is said that outside the broken house is still a storm. The revolutionary spirit of our compatriots is for legitimate defense, and war is to protect the country, which is the principle taught by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, while Japan's war is to expand its country. The Japanese say that withdrawing troops would be a loss of their dignity, which is even more barbaric. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said that the East is the way of the king, and the Western countries are the way of the hegemon. If they want to follow Germany's example, they will perish themselves. Today's Japan is simply a robber's camp, not a country in the world. Even their dignity and hegemony are thrown in the toilet. We certainly cannot use the benevolence of Duke Xiang of Song to talk about shame, but Sun Yat-sen said that although the great powers can destroy China in ten or dozens of days, China still has its strong resistance, which is to fight to the death. Regardless of the way of the king or the way of the hegemon, those without conscience will eventually perish. I hope the League of Nations can have a manifestation of conscience, and this will not hinder our fight to the death. In the next week, a little light may be released in the white clouds, but it is not certain. But if we do not plan to resist, there is no hope for peace, and self-defense is still needed. The spirit of fighting to the death must be prepared at all times, then the national salvation conference in the future must absolutely complete the political construction, must absolutely hand over power to the public, and cannot talk about peaceful reunification. This is what I contribute to the public today. The meeting ended after the report.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held a memorial week for Sun Yat-sen. More than 300 people attended, including Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Niu Yongjian, Shao Lizi, He Yaozu, Lian Shenghai, Li Shuhua, and Kong Xiangxi. Chiang Kai-shek chaired the meeting. Shao Yuanchong reported briefly that the Japanese army has invaded our Northeast for a month. Although our people are extremely angry, they can still maintain order and work with the government to find a way to deal with it. The League of Nations and the United States also attach great importance to this matter. Now, on the one hand, we have full confidence in international assistance, and on the other hand, we must still work hard ourselves. If the League of Nations and the United States cannot resolve the issue, or if Japan does not comply with international restrictions, we will fight to the end for justice and the survival of the nation and vow not to submit. September 18th is indeed our national humiliation, but if we only know how to commemorate the national humiliation and have no will to eliminate it, then the national humiliation will never be avenged. We should investigate the causes of the national humiliation in fact and remedy it from the causes, so that the national humiliation can be eliminated one day. This incident in the Northeast, on the one hand, is enough to test whether the countries of the world have the determination and sincerity to move towards peace. On the other hand, we can only consolidate the foundation of our country and achieve the goal of world peace by following Sun Yat-sen's legacy of peace and struggle to save China. The ceremony ended after the report.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Thorough Investigation of License Tax Disputes: Since Chen Henian, the Director of the Wu-Kun-Tai-Chang Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau, took office, he has been dissatisfied with the oil, wine, and sauce industries in order to rectify the tobacco and alcohol license tax. He said that Director Chen was disturbing businessmen and abusing his power, resulting in major disputes. The Chamber of Commerce's mediation was ineffective, and both sides petitioned the Department of Finance for review. The Department of Finance has now sent Inspector Zhu Fu to Suzhou to thoroughly investigate and mediate. The bureau has previously sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting assistance in collecting taxes. The business side sent a special letter to the Public Security Bureau yesterday (19th), requesting that the execution be postponed until the matter is resolved.</p>
<p>Restaurant Industry Requests Cancellation of Banquet Tax: The Wu County Chamber of Commerce, according to a letter from the Restaurant Industry Association, said that the industry had previously collected banquet taxes on behalf of the government, resulting in significant losses. They requested that the Finance Bureau be asked to send personnel to directly collect the taxes and request that the banquet tax be changed to a business tax. The County Chamber of Commerce immediately submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance yesterday (19th), requesting that all banquet tax surcharges be abolished and replaced with a business tax. At the same time, a letter was sent to the Finance Bureau requesting that it directly collect the banquet tax.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Four Hostages from Mocheng Have Been Released: Mocheng Town in this county was completely looted by bandits in broad daylight on the 15th of this month, and 26 hostages were taken. Two more people were kidnapped in Dachengjing. This has been reported in the previous newspaper. It was rumored in the town the day before yesterday that four people had been released by the bandits. After being kidnapped, the family of the Fang family in the timber industry went to Suzhou that night to negotiate, only to realize that they had been fooled by the bandits. According to the bandits, they stayed in the town for many days and learned about the situation in the town. Therefore, after the robbery, on the evening of the 17th, they pretended to be hostages and used a long-distance phone from the Lichangsheng Fruit Store at No. 1646 in Suzhou to call the Changshu China Merchants Steamship Bureau (which was established by the Fang family in Mocheng), falsely claiming to be Xia Yunkun and Wang Yuansheng, employees of the Muchang timber industry, who had been released by the bandits and were currently staying in a certain hotel. When they went there, they realized that they had been deceived and almost kidnapped. On the 18th, according to reliable information from Mocheng, the two fishermen, Wei Ajin and He Gensheng, who had been kidnapped in Dachengjing, escaped from Fengqiao, Suzhou, on the 17th night and returned to the town by boat on the morning of the 18th. According to their oral accounts, the bandits kidnapped them to lead the way. Therefore, they went from Kuncheng Lake to Xinzhuangtang, Zhaojuntang, and other places, all guided by them. However, in order to prevent the military police from tracking them down, the bandits still drove through the reeds all night. When they arrived at Yangcheng Lake in the morning, the bandits were familiar with the road and went straight to Fengqiao. Therefore, Wei and He were able to take the opportunity to escape. In addition, it was reported that among the Mocheng hostages, there was a female hostage named Fan Zhangshi, accompanied by a 59-day-old child. Fan Zhangshi was ill and had difficulty walking after giving birth. The bandits went to the Weiting area at the junction of Su and Kun and abandoned the two hostages on the shore. They crawled to the local Public Security Bureau and reported the kidnapping and escape. The bureau forwarded the report to Changshu. Mocheng then sent a motorboat to pick them up.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Seizes a Large Batch of Enemy Goods: Since the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association offered a reward for confidential reports, it has received a steady stream of confidential letters from various places. Therefore, Japanese goods have been seized every day. Yesterday, according to a confidential report, the inspection team was dispatched to Fengtaiyuan Qian, located in the Nanyang Tobacco Company opposite the Lequan Bathhouse, and seized eight large boxes of foreign and miscellaneous goods, all of which were Japanese goods, as well as 94 boxes of Simama brand and Six Wheel brand matches. They were immediately transported to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for storage, pending disposal. In addition, the appraisal committee of the association was established yesterday afternoon and will immediately appraise the stored goods separately for disposal.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Unfortunate Incident Occurs During Inspection of Japanese Goods: The Wuyi Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association resolved that various industries should voluntarily seal up Japanese goods and scheduled to send personnel to conduct spot checks on the 19th of this month. The County Chamber of Commerce convened meetings of various industries on this matter. At that time, Hu Ruilin, the manager of Dafengren, strongly opposed it. Upon hearing the news, the students of various schools held an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 17th. On the morning of the 18th, two teams of students went to the Dafengren store and Hu Ruilin's residence to search for Hu Ruilin. As a result, they found him in his residence. There was a slight conflict at the time, and Hu Ruilin and his brother Xianglin were dragged out for a street parade. Two of the store's employees, Zhu Weigen and Chen Hongyuan, tried to snatch them with sticks, but were also seized by the students. They paraded around the downtown area for a week and then took Hu and others to the County Party Headquarters. Upon hearing the news, the Western Cloth Store Association and others went on strike and marched to the Chamber of Commerce, and then petitioned the County Government. The Chamber of Commerce immediately convened a meeting to discuss solutions. After a while, County Magistrate Zhang also arrived. At this time, it was already past 2:00 PM. The merchants suddenly heard that the Anti-Japanese Association had made Hu Ruilin stand in a wooden cage and became even more agitated. They questioned the chairman Guo Cifen and crowded the chairman to the County Party Headquarters. They forcibly rescued Hu Ruilin and wantonly destroyed the County Party Headquarters' Anti-Japanese Association Zhongshan News Agency, and the wooden cage was also broken. The Party Headquarters staff Wu Wenbi and Lu Zao were severely beaten. Afterwards, the students petitioned the County Magistrate and various committee members in the County Government. In addition to reporting the incident to the Provincial Party Headquarters, the County Party Headquarters also held an emergency meeting. The students went on a general strike on the 19th. The County Court sent personnel to examine the injured.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Appeal to the Third Instance of the Xu Zhuoran Assassination Case: After the case of the assassination and death of Xu Zhuoran in Fujian was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Hang County Local Court, Ye Caizhen, Chen Yanxiang, and Chen Delin were found not guilty. Prosecutor Chen Huaming and the plaintiff Xu Ye appealed to the High Court. The Criminal Division No. 1 has heard the case twice. Ye Caizhen and Chen Yanxiang have been allowed to be temporarily released on bail of 20,000 yuan each. The main culprit in the case, Lin Min, has also been escorted from Fujian. The third hearing of the appeal was scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 19th. The defendants Ye Caizhen and Chen Yanxiang arrived on time. The prisoners Lin Min, Lin Luo, Chen Chang, and Zhang Jichang were brought from the detention center to await questioning. However, the plaintiff Xu Ye did not arrive by noon, and the hearing could not be opened. The court announced an adjournment.</p>
<p>Continued Report on the Robbery of the Changxing Coal Mine Bureau: The Changxing Coal Mine Bureau was robbed by Anhui bandits on the 17th, and several staff members, workers, and police officers were killed. The Provincial Government has dispatched a security team to suppress them. It is now known that the bureau was robbed by bandits, and the mine police opened fire to resist. The bandits gathered more than 200 people, all armed with fast and sharp weapons, and the police were unable to resist. As a result, the bandits seized two machine guns, more than 40 wooden shell guns, and more than 60 rifles. The director of the bureau, Zhu Shiyun (the elder brother of the former director of the Provincial Security Department, Zhu Shiming), was shot and killed on the spot. Four or five other workers and police officers died one after another due to severe gunshot wounds. More than a dozen others were slightly injured. The bureau's property was severely damaged. Zeng Ganting, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the Seventh Security Regiment, led two companies of soldiers and arrived on the 18th at 5:00 PM. On the same day, they launched a counter-offensive and killed many bandits. The bandits were unable to resist and fled towards Shoufeng Mountain at the border of Guangchang. As for the cause of the incident, it was actually because the director of the bureau usually treated the miners very harshly. He would fire them for the slightest dissatisfaction, causing the miners to harbor deep resentment, which led to this disaster.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>A Major Incident Occurs During the Inspection of Goods: The Hefei Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement has recently dispatched an inspection team to the river and a second team to the post office to inspect imported enemy goods. They are very serious. In order to identify them carefully, they have formed an appraisal committee and hired Lu Lianfu and Li Jingtang, two members of the Chamber of Commerce, as advisors for consultation. At noon on the 12th, a package of gingham and navy blue overcoating was sent from Shanghai to Hengsheng Silk and Satin Shop, a subsidiary of Yufeng in Hefei. Hengsheng sent someone to pick up the goods. The inspectors insisted on sending them to the appraisal committee for appraisal. The person picking up the goods refused. Lu insisted on cutting a sample for appraisal and sending the goods to the Chamber of Commerce for safekeeping. As a result, a dispute arose. The goods were sent to the Chamber of Commerce, and Lu also resigned from the Anti-Japanese Association in the evening. Early on the 13th, a large group of male and female students from secondary schools, believing that Lu was suspected of disobeying the inspection, crowded to Lu's residence behind the Shatongqing shop on Ximen Street. They put a paper hat on Lu and paraded him around the downtown area for a week before sending him to the County Government for custody. At the same time, shops in the eastern half of the city closed. An emergency meeting was held in the Chamber of Commerce. The standing committee members Yang Licuo and Ding Likun and others were sent to the 46th Division Headquarters to appeal. The division immediately dispatched Battalion Commander Hu Encheng to lead a team to suppress the situation and prevent the situation from escalating. They also sent Adjutant Sun Jingquan to the Chamber of Commerce with County Magistrate Zhu Tingliao to hold a meeting and persuade the shops to open. The remaining matters were referred to the law for resolution. The Anti-Japanese Association also held a meeting in the evening and decided to distribute a declaration to announce the incident. The camp and the county are still mediating, and it is not known how it will be resolved.</p>
<p>Special Feature on Education News</p>
<h3>Educational Facilities That Should Exist Amidst the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement (Part Two) by Lu Shaoji</h3>
<p>(4) Emphasis on Science Education: If science does not flourish, industries will not prosper and the people's livelihood will decline; if science does not flourish, people's intelligence will not be enlightened and superstitions will not be eliminated; moreover, if science does not flourish, military equipment will not be sophisticated and defense will not be strong. The reason why our country has few domestic goods today and why it cannot fight against Japan is largely due to the lack of emphasis on science education. Therefore, in the future, education should: 1. vigorously promote the import of scientific knowledge; 2. pay attention to laboratory work; 3. emphasize the manufacture of domestic goods; and 4. pay attention to the manufacture and application of new-style military machinery.</p>
<p>(5) Implement International Education: World communication has now developed. A person is not only a citizen of a country, but also a citizen of the world. Teachers must enable students to understand the national conditions of their own country and also the international situation. The reason why Chinese people dreamed that the [League of Nations] would uphold justice in this anti-Japanese war is because they did not know that the League was an organization where great powers jointly oppressed weak nations. Therefore, in the future, education should: 1. enable students to study the international situation, such as [the Pacific Problem, the content of the Kellogg-Briand Pact], and the relationship and attitude of the great powers towards this incident; and 2. enable students to study the policies that our country should adopt.</p>
<p>(6) Prohibition of Colonial Education: This is a special kind of education implemented by great powers in their colonies. Its purpose is not to impart knowledge and skills to the educated, but to use educational methods to make them forget their own culture and completely assimilate to the conquering country. For example, the education that the British give to Indians only tries to turn Indians into British, just as the education that the Japanese give to Koreans only tries to turn Koreans into Japanese. These are all colonial educations. Japan has long established many colonial schools in Southern Manchuria and Shandong in our country. On the one hand, it has done its best to encourage its schools to invade China, and on the other hand, it has done its best to teach Chinese people to despise their own culture and be loyal to the Japanese Empire. The reason why the Japanese are using various tricks to promote the independence of Manchuria this time is to use this educational method to annex our territory. Therefore, our government should strictly prohibit this kind of education. At the same time, it must also issue a notice to the people of our country not to send their children to study at the colonial schools they have opened.</p>
<p>All Chinese people have recognized that this [Shenyang Incident] is the beginning of the Chinese nation's long-term struggle against foreign oppression and is a ray of hope for China's future. However, if we now want to take up arms to defend our motherland, we must implement [Military Education] and [Science Education]. If we want to make the people have a national concept and international common sense, we must implement [Public Education] and [International Education]. If we want to wipe out the current national humiliation, we must implement [National Humiliation Education]. If we want to prevent the people of the whole country from being deceived by the Japanese, we must prohibit [Colonial Education]. Moreover, if we want to revitalize industry and increase production to recover our rights and interests, we must also pay attention to [Science Education]. [Military Self-Defense], [National Revolution], [Revitalizing Industry], [Wiping Out Humiliation and Striving for Strength]... are all important issues facing China today. Unless we do this, we will never be able to eliminate traitors today and eliminate foreign aggression in the future, and we will not betray the sacrifices of our compatriots who died in the Northeast. Therefore, the six types of education mentioned above are all educational facilities that should exist after the Shenyang Incident and are the right medicine for China today. I hope that all colleagues in the education field will not treat my words as nonsense. (The End)</p>

<h3>More Than 200 Students Studying in Japan Return to China</h3>
<p>Will Continue to Petition the Ministry of Education for Relief</p>
<p>The delegation of students studying in Japan resolutely returned to China in anger at the barbaric and unreasonable behavior of Japan. Yesterday, more than 300 students studying in Japan arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru. In recent days, they have been extremely busy with the anti-Japanese national salvation movement and reporting the truth about the barbaric Japanese to various schools. The following is a record of the news that has been obtained.</p>
<p>Continued Arrival of Students: Yesterday afternoon, more than 200 students studying in Japan arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru of the Japanese merchant shipping company. The delegation immediately rushed to the pier to welcome them and provide registration.</p>
<p>Continuing Petition: The representatives of the delegation of students studying in Japan who were sent to Nanjing to petition have returned to Shanghai the night before. The National Government and the Ministry of Education have given satisfactory answers. However, regarding the issue of travel expenses for all students studying in Japan to return to China and the issue of living after returning to China, they still plan to send representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Education in order to achieve the purpose and purpose of returning to China.</p>
<p>Registration Issues: The delegation believes that the students are returning to China to participate in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. Therefore, entering school or service at this time is not only contrary to the original intention of returning to China, but will also weaken the general public's belief in students studying in Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to wait for the decision of the general assembly before registering. And they will send someone to clarify this intention to the representatives sent by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Attending Speeches: Yesterday, the delegation sent representatives Zhang Guiyi and Zhao Pingzhang to Nanyang Advanced Commercial Middle School, and Tai Zhiping and Nie Wenfang to Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College to commemorate the week, reporting on the situation of students studying in Japan returning to China, the situation of Japan's invasion of our country, and the national conditions of Japan.</p>

<h3>Representative of the Middle School Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation Pays Homage to Hu Hanmin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hu Huizhong, Yi Huang Zongwan, Yuan Jiliang, Sun Yu, Wang Fuchang, Zhou Jialiang, Han Jixian, Fang Xuanzhou, and Wei Yumei, ten cadres of the Middle School Anti-Japanese Salvation Federation, went to Sun Yat-sen's residence on Moli'ai Road to pay homage to Hu Hanmin. The following is an excerpt of the important talks: One question: What is your attitude towards this peace conference? Answer: This time, the comrades in Beijing and Guangdong abandoned their personal prejudices, understood each other, and achieved peaceful unification. I also hope that in the future, we can truly unite and reorganize the national government to resist foreign aggression. Second question: I heard that you advocate direct negotiations between China and Japan. Is that true? Answer: The so-called direct negotiations by Japan means that third countries are not allowed to interfere. The direct negotiations advocated by our country involve the participation of third countries. All diplomacy of an independent country cannot be independent. Relying on foreigners is tantamount to losing its independence. Third question: In this time of national crisis, what attitude should middle school students take? Answer: They should strive for military training within the possible scope. Girls should pay more attention to rescue work and physical exercise, and go to the countryside to do propaganda work in their spare time to make the general villagers understand the various situations in China today. Fourth question: Should middle school students raise funds for national salvation? Answer: This matter should start from the students themselves. I strongly agree.</p>

<h3>Zhang Daofan Gave a Speech at Shanghai University Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai Hujiang University continues to hold classes as usual and strive for the national salvation movement. The school specially invited Zhang Daofan, a member of the Central Committee and the current Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, to give a speech. He said that Japan's various atrocities in the Northeast this time are not only aimed at invading the Northeast, but also at implementing its continental policy and wanting to destroy China. When this disaster is imminent, if everyone can have the determination and method in extreme indignation, and the whole country unites as one and fights for a long time, then we will be able to recuperate, train, and our strength will become stronger day by day. Why worry that we cannot deal with Japan? However, if we are motivated by emotion and lead to strikes, strikes, and market strikes, and sacrifice from a negative perspective, this kind of suicidal behavior should be avoided as much as possible. We must know that there are many ways to save the country. It is important that the people can make efforts based on their own strength, move upwards, and serve as a strong backing for the government. You are still holding classes as usual today and studying military affairs and chemistry, and are doing national salvation work from an academic perspective, which can be said to be focusing on the fundamentals. I hope you will deeply refine yourselves and persevere. Finally, I (Zhang's self-proclaimed) respectfully give you two words: "Study without forgetting national salvation, and save the country without forgetting study." I hope you will not regard them as old sayings. The words were extremely profound and alarming, and the students were all moved. The meeting adjourned after the speech.</p>

<h3>Special</h3>
<p>Liu Haisu's Report to the Ministry of Education After Returning to China (II)</p>
<p>After Haisu's research on the Renaissance era came to an end, he entered the third stage of research. First, he explored the origin of Baroque art in Italy, and then returned to Paris to study the spread of Baroque art in Spain, Flanders, and the Netherlands. He successively selected works by Caravagio, Reni, Caracci, El Greco, Velazquez, Rubens, Rembrandt, and others as research objects. During this period, due to the shift in atmosphere, Flanders and the Netherlands became the center of the generation. Haisu wanted to investigate the reasons for the shift, so in the autumn of that year, he went to Belgium and traveled to Brussels, Leuven, Antwerp, and other places to study the paintings of the Flemish school, and traced back to the Gothic era, discovering the king of painting, Van Eyck, and extending to the works of Rubens, Van Dyck, and later writers in the Baroque era. He then realized that the shift in atmosphere in the 18th century had its own historical background. After the establishment of modern countries, each had its own centralizing area and its own form of religious life, and a special artistic style was formed as a result. In the winter of that year, he returned to Paris to study the transition from Baroque to Rococo, and from Rococo to the Classical School. He chose representative authors such as Poussin, Wafteau, Bouchel, David, and Goya as research objects. Haisu observed the Renaissance and the period after the 19th century in this period of research. He knew everything about the origin and the prospect of the road. To sum up the 17th and 18th centuries, from the rich and broad form to the extravagant and greasy, it is a reflection of the flatness and detailed development of the life of the times. The orientation of taste is concentrated in the palace. The historical evidence is even more obvious.</p>
<p>Although Haisu's research in these three stages has been slightly completed, he is still not satisfied, because he has not yet set foot in the northern field of modern art. Therefore, in the spring of the 20th year, he went to Germany again to view the works of the master of the Renaissance in this area, Diuler, as well as the works of Flemish and Dutch writers of the 18th century that remained in Germany, and was able to slightly make up for the shortcomings of this time. He then returned to Paris and made a final review of the notes and atlases he had studied for two and a half years. This is the situation regarding the research aspect.</p>
<p>II. Regarding Production</p>
<p>Haisu, as an artist, not only sought historical knowledge during this trip, but also wanted to increase his practical skills. He never forgot to make exercises during the two and a half years he was in Europe. After arriving in Paris, in addition to viewing famous works, he successively copied the masterpieces of Titian, Rembrandt, Torokroya, and Kehe and Cezanne in the Louvre. In addition, he made occasional works in the landscape climbing and research room. Since arriving in Europe, he has made more than 230 pieces of work. In September of the 18th year, his work "Qianmen in Beijing" was selected for the Autumn Salon.</p>
<p>In May of the 19th year, his works in the Salon Tillery were "Forest," "Night Moon," "The Shack of Saint-Jan Joe," and "Early Spring in Rose Village," a total of four pieces.</p>
<p>In September of the 19th year, his second entry into the Autumn Salon, "Sunflower" and "Rest" a total of two pieces.</p>

At that time, the ship will dock in the Jiangmian area of Yangshupu Lan Road, at buoy number seventeen. Chairman Jiang has also designated Chen Mingshu and Zhang Qun as representatives to welcome them. Chen and others will prepare a small steamboat to meet them. However, if the ship arrives later tonight, Chen and others plan to take the small steamboat to Wusong to meet them.</p>

Gu Mengyu called on Hu by appointment in the afternoon around 4:00 PM and left after speaking for more than twenty minutes. He briefly reported on the hopes of the committees remaining in Guangdong for Hu.</p>
<p>Li and Bai's Joint Telegram: Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi telegraphed: "Respectfully to Mr. Hu Zhantang: We were delighted to learn of Your Excellency's arrival in Shanghai and wish you good health. From now on, the party and the nation have leadership, and our comrades have someone to admire. We eagerly await your guidance with the utmost joy. In addition to asking Brother Li Muyao to present a letter and inquire after your well-being, we send this telegram to express our comfort and seek your instruction. Respectfully, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi."</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang's Telegram: "Respectfully to Mr. Hu Zhantang: I have heard that you have arrived in Shanghai to mediate peace, which is a great comfort to the people's eager hopes and can save the nation from danger. I am overjoyed and ask my office's Counselor Wang Fanting to call on you and convey my respect. I hope you will instruct him. Respectfully, Zhang Zhijiang."</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo Arrives in Shanghai: According to a certain important person who told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, Chen Gongbo and others arrived in Shanghai on a ship the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they visited various important people and plan to request an audience with Hu Zhantang in a day or two.</p>
<p>Hu Moved Into New Residence Yesterday: Hu's new residence, rented at No. 301, Maisi Ai Road in the French Concession, was originally scheduled to move in the night before last. However, because the interior was not completely arranged, the move was delayed. He still stayed at Sun's residence. Yesterday evening around 6:00 PM, Hu ordered his daughters to move in first.

<p>Discussion on Women's Movement: Lin Kecong and Wang Xiaoying, standing committee members of the Shanghai Women's Relief Association, called on Hu Hanmin yesterday and were personally received. He gave many instructions on the women's movement. A summary of his remarks is as follows: Hu said that the women's movement should focus on cultivating virtue, intelligence, skills, and physical fitness to cope with the current environment. The organization of rescue teams is an urgent task. This organization should be permanent so that it is ready to serve the country at any time. Recently, many people have been calling for opposition to direct negotiations, which is a mistake. Direct negotiations must have some limitations. Before diplomatic relations are severed, it cannot be said that all negotiations should be stopped. As for whether all sectors can attend and observe the peace conference, it will be determined when the committee members arrive in Shanghai. If outside participation is allowed, all groups can send representatives, not just the business community. After speaking for about an hour, Lin and Wang excused themselves and left.</p>

The federation also plans to hold a formal welcome after all the representatives arrive in Shanghai. Minhang Business Community Telegram: The Shanghai County Minhang Town Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association telegraphed: "Respectfully to Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Mr. Hu Zhantang in Shanghai, and Mr. Wang Jingwei, Sun Zhesheng, Gu Xiangqin, Xiao Focheng, Deng Zheru, and Li Delin in Guangzhou: This time, the violent Japanese are pursuing an aggressive policy, occupying cities, expelling officials, burning institutions, killing soldiers and civilians, looting shops, and cutting off transportation, committing unprecedented atrocities and setting a terrible international precedent. As news of this spread, we are filled with anger and pain. All of you are advanced leaders of the party and the nation. At this critical moment of survival, can you not fear the destruction of the nest and the annihilation of the eggs?

<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Announces to All Businessmen to Work Together to Resist Japan and Save the Nation</h3>
<p>Uphold Justice Regardless of Suspicion and Resentment</p>
<p>Avoid Unnecessary Sacrifices</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all businessmen, stating: "Regarding the matter of notification, the Japanese army's forceful occupation of Liaoning and Jilin and its encroachment on Mongolia and Heilongjiang is a matter of life and death for our country, and its seriousness is unprecedented. At this time of advancing warfare, the outcome of the war depends not only on the military strength of the two countries but also on the intelligence and financial cooperation of the entire country. This is the so-called industrial mobilization and economic mobilization. Therefore, if we want to restrain the violent Japanese and make them suffer, we must devise a plan within the scope of public morality. Except for economic severance with Japan, there is no other option. Therefore, the responsibility for saving the nation rests entirely on the shoulders of the businessmen. In other words, it is equivalent to the national army entrusting the task of charging and engaging in close combat on the front line, and the magnitude of the sacrifice is already expected. Our business community is well aware that this great cause of saving the nation cannot be undertaken by strangers. Therefore, the temporary members' representative meeting of this association first passed a resolution on businessmen's voluntary economic severance with Japan, followed by the organization of Japanese goods inspection teams by various trade associations. The cotton cloth trade association once independently reported two fellow traders who were privately selling Japanese goods and sent the people and goods to the Anti-Japanese Association. The paper trade association raised objections to the Anti-Japanese Association's resolution to return the Japanese goods measuring paper to the Measurement Bureau, saying that there were other countries' goods that could replace them, and finally persuaded the Anti-Japanese Association to adopt a resolution. All of these bold and decisive spirits are unprecedented and have added color to our business community. As for the Anti-Japanese Association, it has gathered important figures from all walks of life to form a joint organization. Among them, the important work of inspection should also be transferred from the hands of the labor committee members to the hands of the business committee members at the request of the business community, which is enough to show mutual harmony and cooperation, all with the goal of overcoming national difficulties. However, in terms of anti-Japanese work, there is a lack of established rules, and in terms of personnel, they are temporarily gathered. It is difficult to ensure that all have the necessary qualities and adequate training. It cannot be said that their temporary handling will not be excessive or even violate the discipline set by the association. Among them, there are also violations of the covenant by businessmen, which have aroused incidents that our trade associations have not noticed. It is not uncommon for our business community to feel indignant and express their dissatisfaction due to the unexpected demands of this enthusiastic voluntary boycott. But what time is it now? Is it not a time when the nation's life and death are at stake? Is it not a time when our nation's existence is hanging by a thread? In the past, Lian Xiangru humbled himself to Lian Po, and finally preserved the State of Zhao. In the late Ming Dynasty, the Eastern Forest Party and Ma Ruan were at odds with each other, and the society was eventually overthrown. Our industrial and commercial circles are the backbone of the anti-Japanese movement. Any mistake will lead to the collapse of the whole situation, and this line of resistance will be rendered useless, resulting in the real disaster of subjugation and causing our enemies to secretly laugh at us. At that time, who will be able to understand our business community? Therefore, what this association hopes for from our various associations at this time is to abide by Confucius's ancient teachings of being strict with oneself and generous with others, to encourage and supervise our fellow traders to be of one mind and one heart, and to prioritize economic severance with Japan. If there are unexpected and unreasonable troubles, those who can tolerate them should tolerate them in order to wait for the truth to come to light and avoid escalating disputes. As for the duties of this association, saving the nation and protecting merchants are equally important and cannot be neglected. Within the possible scope, or if there are regulations that can be referred to by the Anti-Japanese Association, this association will uphold justice regardless of suspicion and resentment to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and comfort the enthusiasm of our business community for voluntary boycotts. In the past, India's religious and racial divisions were a great obstacle to resisting the British, but they were able to sense their own isolation and gather under Gandhi's banner, which eventually forced the British to concede. Moreover, our industrial and commercial circles are of the same nation and have the same interests, and there are no boundaries to divide. Therefore, we hereby issue a letter to all trade associations, shops, and businessmen in the city, hoping that they will all understand this intention. This is of utmost importance. This is a special notice.</p>

<h3>No Shark Fins and Abalone on the Banquet Table</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to the Catering Industry Association yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of opening the case, since the anti-Japanese case has been raised and economic severance has been implemented, all kinds of special Japanese products have long been rejected and unused, and each family has been informed. It has been found that the shark fins and abalone used on the banquet table are all Japanese products, but they are still used as before without any reform, which is not correct. Recently, someone sent a letter to abolish the method, and the proposition is correct and can be adopted. However, this matter should be forwarded by your association to all restaurants for uniform reform and no longer used in order to implement it. Accordingly, we hereby inform you, and we hope that you will investigate and handle it accordingly."</p>
<h3>Notice to Merchants and People: Poisoning of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association issued a notice stating: "According to the public telegram column of yesterday's newspapers, a telegram from Canada stated that the Shanghai Japanese Newspaper Association forwarded to various groups that yellow salted fish were shipped from Canada on that day. It was found that Japanese merchants were angered by our anti-Japanese movement and secretly placed poison in the fish. Do not buy and eat it. The Vancouver Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Based on this, it was found that the violent Japanese are narrow-minded and jealous. They are accustomed to using tricks and despicable means. The purpose is to make our entire nation rot like fish. However, since there is such a fact, the poisoning will not only affect yellow salted fish. We hope that our national merchants and people will reject buying and selling Japanese goods and pay special attention to Japanese food to avoid being poisoned and buried in the stomach of a fish. This is a special notice. Please do not ignore it."</p>
<h3>Dongzhuang Public Office Removed the City Sign</h3>
<p>The Dongzhuang Foreign Goods Public Office sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Regarding the reply, we received your letter No. 28 on October 15, informing us of the righteousness and ordering us to remove the city sign. Based on this, it was found that the recent Japanese riots have shocked the whole country. If our people do not thoroughly relieve the victims, it is tantamount to leading ourselves to the tragedy of national subjugation. Our fellow traders, although engaged in this industry, are still citizens. How dare we not be aware of ourselves and seek our own destruction? Fortunately, all fellow traders have a deep understanding of righteousness and have unanimously and voluntarily stopped business and withdrawn the Zhuangke stationed in Osaka to show our determination. As for the city sign in front of our office, it has long been removed, and eight characters [Unite as One to Resist Foreign Aggression] have been pasted on the original position to show our determination. All inventory of fellow traders has been selected by our association to send six supervisors to monitor and seal the inventory in order to solve the problem. Furthermore, the fellow traders of our association have been engaged in national goods for many years, and there are not a few who have set up imitation factories. The name of our association is also actively preparing for reorganization. Once the name is changed and the rules are drafted, we will submit them to your association for guidance.</p>

This only way is [economic severance] is [not to buy things from them, nor to sell things to them] because we know that Japan is an industrial country, and any industrial country must need raw materials and markets to survive. The raw materials of Japan are exactly what we Chinese rely on, and the market of Japan is exactly our China. Japan's economic relationship with us is so deep. Once we cut it off, can it survive? Can it still be strong? Therefore, this is our only way to resist violence and save the country. Comrades, the current crisis does not allow us to hesitate any longer. We must stand up to save ourselves. We must take the means of economic severance. We will not sell or buy Japanese goods. We will firmly and eternally implement it. That is the only way to save our nation and country from danger. At the same time, it can control the violent enemies to death.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Minhang Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association: The Minhang Town Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association telegraphed: "The Shanghai newspaper offices forwarded to the national business community for public review. This time, the Japanese are violent and want to fulfill their dream of the East Continent. They are willing to violate the covenant and send troops to the Eastern Province, massacring soldiers and civilians with ferocious cruelty, which has never been heard of before. Anyone with blood can not be angry. We businessmen are also descendants of Yan and Huang. At this time of wind and rain, we are more concerned about the fear of the lips dying and the teeth being cold. We only think that the anti-Japanese work is to boycott Japanese goods as an urgent and important measure, and its responsibility is the heaviest for businessmen. After a general meeting of representatives of various industries, we decided to telegraph the national business community to rise up together, organize anti-Japanese national salvation associations, and strictly implement economic severance with Japan in order to save the crisis.

<h3>All Chinese Ships on the Yangtze River Will Resume Operations</h3>
<p>The Headquarters Has Agreed to Return Them</p>
<p>Since May 17, the Yangtze River steamships of the three companies in this port have been chartered by the Transportation Department of the headquarters to transport troops to various places in Beijing and Hubei, and all Chinese ships on the Yangtze River have been suspended for five months. Recently, since the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement has occurred, the Yangtze River Japanese ships have been completely suspended, and Chinese goods and passengers are not transported on Japanese ships.

We are now convening an emergency general meeting of the members of the four groups in order to gather the anti-Japanese and national salvation work of the national products industry, and to discuss issues such as relief of raw materials and protection of national products, and to jointly plan our course of action. Investigating and intensifying anti-Japanese work is the way to concentrate our strength to save the country from its plight. Relieving raw materials is the way to maintain the livelihood of workers and friends and maintain stability in the rear. Protecting national products is the way to increase production and resist Japanese goods. It is deeply and greatly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Fellow comrades, if you have sound opinions and precise plans, please express them fully and provide them for the consideration of all. This association will sincerely accommodate them and do our best with an indomitable fighting spirit to fulfill the duty of a member of the nation.

<h3>News of Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Shang Zhen Sends Telegram to Zhu Qinglan</p>
<p>Remitting Over 4,000 Yuan in Relief Funds</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Ziqiao received a telegram from the Shunde Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which said: "Our entire army is voluntarily donating 4,366.10 yuan for flood relief. We plan to remit it to you for distribution in the disaster areas. Please telegraph the address to which the funds should be remitted. Respectfully, Shang Zhen."</p>
<h3>Relief Association Maintains Shenyang Workers in Distress</h3>
<p>Shenyang Ordnance Factory personnel who escaped to Shanghai after the disaster have organized a petition maintenance group, requesting the government to find a way to settle them so as to maintain their livelihoods. The National Flood Disaster Association telegraphed the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs for settlement. The National Government Relief Association has decided to maintain the food of all personnel starting today. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from the Flood Disaster Association: The group received a letter from the National Government Flood Disaster Relief Association yesterday, which said: "We received your letter stating that you fled to Shanghai due to military disaster and are unemployed and have no means of support, and requesting that food be provided from the relief funds. This association is for flood relief, and the funds are specifically designated for that purpose, so it is difficult to provide other assistance. However, your group's escape to Shanghai this time is particularly pitiful. We have telegraphed Deputy Minister Chen of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs and Mayor Zhang of Shanghai to find a way to settle them in factories, and have sent a letter to the Relief Association to provide assistance as appropriate. This is to inform you."</p>
<p>Maintaining Food: There are 314 people in distress who have no home to return to, and most of them are temporarily living in the Qu Zhenren Temple. Their current livelihood is truly worrying. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the National Government Relief Commission sent three people, including Mr. Sun, to inspect the situation at the Qu Zhenren Temple. They agreed to provide food expenses to the people in distress by name, starting today. Therefore, the group canceled its original plan to petition the municipal government again yesterday and immediately notified all the people in distress to gather at the Qu Zhenren Temple this morning to await relief.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Work of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Area: Mr. Wang Tingxian (a western missionary and pastor of the China Inland Mission), a member of the Yangzhou branch's relief work group, reported: "Our branch has distributed relief goods such as cotton clothing and flour twice, totaling 10,650 bags of flour, as well as some beans, biscuits, and new and old cotton clothing. The standard of our relief work is to pay attention to giving to those who deserve it. Those who have relief tickets without clear investigation will not be distributed. All the members of our group are fulfilling their duties and are very diligent in their work. For the first step of the investigation, six teams of people must set off every morning in six small boats and sail to the agreed location to inspect each household on the ground. Those who are not truly starving will not be given assistance. Those who are truly dying will first be given relief tickets, with their address and name noted, and the stubs will be kept. Each investigation team's stamp will be temporarily affixed to the relief ticket, and a clear mark will be left on the wall of their home. The work of the investigation team is quite serious and meticulous, in order to ensure that the funds are not wasted, and the team members are diligent and tireless all day long, which is very admirable. They generally set off in the early morning and can only return to the association after sunset. Sometimes they cannot return on the same day and will return the next day. There were also two times when they were stranded for four days due to strong winds encountered on the way. When the team members return, they are often exhausted and hoarse, which shows the effort they put into their work. After the investigation, relief goods are distributed according to the address, and issued by ticket, with extreme caution. More than 10,000 bags of flour have been distributed in two times, benefiting 34,957 people. The third time is already being prepared to set off, and 5,000 bags of flour have also been loaded."</p>
<p>Yancheng Area: The disaster area in Yancheng reaches 14,000 square miles, and the water level is about 20 feet. There are 280,000 farm households. Currently, less than 1,000 households cannot live in their homes. It is planned to set up four major shelters to maintain them for six months, with monthly expenses of 500 yuan per person. At present, clothing is the most urgent need. If the weather gets colder, the victims will inevitably freeze to death. However, due to the large disaster and limited funds, they dare not proceed freely. They have decided to delineate the four most severely affected areas in the fourteen disaster areas and focus on them in particular for immediate relief.</p>
<p>Funing Area: The water level in Funing has not decreased, and the southeastern area has been severely affected. Only one-third of the farmhouses are still habitable. It is also planned to organize two shelters. Food is distributed to the men for immediate relief. The need for clothing is the same as in Yancheng. 2,000 yuan of the 6,000 yuan allocated for relief has been used for emergency work, so the construction of houses for shelter has not yet begun. All 4,000 yuan are used for emergency relief, which is also a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem.</p>

We are sending the five donation books along with the donation, which will be remitted by the Bank of Communications."</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Ends Fundraising for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association has planned to raise funds for emergency disaster relief in various provinces through the Standing Committee, and has appointed 200 members, each of whom has been issued a donation book to raise funds separately. The funds raised have been remitted to the bank, totaling more than 10,000 yuan, and formal receipts have been issued by the emergency relief association for verification. For the remaining donation books that have not been returned, the association sent a letter yesterday urging all members who have not returned the donation books to quickly return the donation books and donations to the association for transfer to the emergency relief for distribution to the disaster areas, so as to conclude the fundraising.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Association's Relief Work in Jiangsu and Hubei</h3>
<p>The local Shanghai Jisheng Association has been handling emergency relief in Jiangsu, Hubei, and other provinces, as previously reported. According to Mr. Gu Yabin, a relief worker at the association's Hankou relief office, 720 bags of relief flour have been inspected and allocated to Xiaba Ji, Zhongba Ji, and Sijia in Wuchang Wuhui Dike, as well as Baoan and Yongbao in the third district. Ruichang, Jinhua, and Renshou in Wuqing Township near Jinkou, and Qijia in Congshan Township have also been inspected and allocated more than 560 bags of flour, which will be distributed in about three or four days to conclude the work. The 460 bags of relief flour in Huangshigang were first taken to Wuchang by Mr. Zheng Yansheng, chairman of the local chamber of commerce. After the relief work is completed, Mr. Gu Yabin and all the relief workers will go to the area to conduct a thorough inspection and distribution. Yangyezhou and Sanhuazhou nearby were the most severely affected by the disaster, and it is planned to select a part of the most distressed area for preferential relief. The epidemic in Hankou is very prevalent. The Hankou branch of this association has set up a temporary epidemic relief station to provide medical treatment and medicine and provide assistance to patients at any time, which will be opened soon, and so on. According to Mr. Ma Shuliang, a relief worker in Yangzhou, Jiangbei, Jiangsu, he has returned to Yangzhou from inspecting and distributing relief along the Jiangdu Second District Foganzhou and Lianchengzhou. The disaster victims along the river have moved to the desolate riverbank due to the flooding of their fields and houses, and have also suffered the tragedy of river collapse. All the remaining properties and seeds have been washed away, so special arrangements must be made to provide additional relief. A total of 256 households were found to be eligible for relief, and each household was given one to two bags of relief flour as appropriate. In addition, 555 households with more than 3,000 people along the river in the two continents were given four catties of relief flour for each adult and two catties for each child. Dozens of orphans, widows, disabled people, and extremely poor households were given double the relief. The flood victims demanded subsidies for labor relief, as the people had no hope of returning home to settle down and reorganize their fields unless the river breach was blocked. The relief workers took bathtubs to inspect and distribute relief in various weirs, where the water depth was still two to three feet. People were living in small wooden pavilions on the water as their homes had been flooded, which was extremely tragic, and so on. It is reported that as the emergency relief period has passed, the association is now focusing on winter relief of clothing and food and labor relief of water conservancy, in order to save the poor and benefit them for centuries.</p>
<h3>The Fourth District of the County徵募 Old Clothes for Disaster Relief</h3>

<h3>Three Workers Beaten by Japanese, Requesting Judge to View Injuries</h3>
<p>Police Accuse Three of Rioting</p>
<p>Japanese Have No Evidence to Present</p>
<p>Each Sentenced to a Fine of Three Dollars</p>
<p>Song Shaoji's Generous Speech</p>
<p>Japanese residents in Shanghai have been provoking incidents everywhere in recent days, and the marines from Japanese warships are particularly rampant, staging demonstrations. In areas where Japanese residents are concentrated, such as Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, and Xiaoshadu, where Japanese-owned textile factories are located, incidents have frequently occurred, making the situation very serious. The day before yesterday, being a Sunday, schools and factories were closed as usual. In the morning, Chinese students gave speeches on various roads in western Shanghai about the atrocities of Japanese soldiers. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army dispatched armored vehicles to suppress them. Although the public was extremely indignant and gathered spontaneously in the thousands, they still exercised great restraint. The Japanese had no excuse to provoke trouble, and a major disaster was averted. However, in the afternoon, a sudden dispute arose in front of the cotton mills inside and outside Macau Road. Japanese soldiers later rushed to the scene with great fanfare. A Japanese national named Ueki Yoshitsugu, who worked at the textile factory, directed other Japanese employees to arrest five Chinese people. Two of them were young children and were released. However, Wang Wanglin, Liu Guren, and Song Shaoji were all detained inside the factory. Subsequently, a telephone call was made to the Putuo Road police station, claiming that workers were rioting and destroying property. The police chief immediately dispatched foreign and Chinese detectives, who rushed to the scene and took the three workers into custody. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where they were charged with destruction of property under Article 382 of the Criminal Code. Judge Shen Shumu conducted the interrogation. According to the report of the Chinese detective, they received a telephone call from the factory stating that Chinese people were rioting and beating Japanese people. Fourteen Japanese employees of the factory apprehended five people and said that many glass windows had been smashed. Japanese soldiers were also attacked by the crowd with stones. Therefore, the police dispatched detectives to arrest the defendants and requested an investigation. Ueki Yoshitsugu, a Japanese national, stated that initially there were only about a hundred people gathered outside the factory, but soon there were a thousand people. About three or four hundred people rushed into the factory. All that could be heard were shouts and the sound of stones smashing glass. When Judge Shen asked where the broken glass was, he said that it had not been brought. When asked that if there were hundreds of people, why were only three or so arrested, the Japanese national said that because there were only fourteen Japanese people in the factory, they could only catch that many people. When asked why the crowd swarmed into the factory, he could not answer and presented a Japanese newspaper, as if to say that the reasons for this matter were detailed in the newspaper. Judge Shen then questioned the three defendants, but none of them admitted to rioting. According to Wang Wanglin, he worked at the Huafeng Flour Mill. Yesterday, he and Liu were passing by the area when they were forcibly stopped by Japanese people. They were stabbed with bayonets, beaten with gun butts, and forcibly detained in the factory. He said that his head still had serious injuries. He showed that his head was indeed wrapped in white cloth. Liu Guren also took off his clothes in court and asked the judge to examine his injuries. Song Shaoji also said that he was forcibly dragged into the factory by Japanese people when he was passing by the factory gate. They opened their mouths and bit him all over, and their ferocity did not cease. They tied his hands and arbitrarily hung him up to beat him. One Japanese person was holding a sharp knife and was about to harm him when Foreign Constable No. 283 arrived at the factory, and his life was saved. After Judge Shen finished the interrogation, he immediately sentenced each of them to a fine of three dollars. If they were unable to pay, they would be imprisoned for one day. He then asked Wang and others whether they accepted the verdict. Wang and Liu both said that they were unable to pay the fine and had no other comments. Song then made a generous speech, saying, "Since the verdict has been issued, there is no question of not accepting it. Not to mention a mere three-dollar fine, even a heavy punishment would not be avoided. But what will be done about being so severely beaten by the Japanese?" Those who heard it were deeply moved. However, the police seemed to think that the circumstances of the case were not minor and were quite dissatisfied with the three-dollar fine. They intended to appeal, so they requested that the judge order Wang and others to post bail during the appeal period. Judge Shen granted the request and ordered Wang, Liu, and Song to each post a bail of one hundred dollars pending review.</p>
<h3>Still a Thousand People Watching Xue Die Case</h3>
<p>Hu and Lin Both Absent Yesterday</p>
<p>Lawyer Debate Quite Intense</p>
<p>Movie actress Hu Die previously filed a lawsuit against her fiancé, Lin Xuehuai, through lawyer Zhan Jifeng, to terminate their engagement and recover outstanding debts. After the First Special District Local Court ruled against the defendant, Lin was dissatisfied and, through his representative lawyers Eson and Ni Zheng, filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the trial of the case. The number of men and women who came to the court to listen did not decrease compared to the past. By around 2 PM, the second courtroom of the High Court was already overcrowded with no less than a thousand people. However, the appellant Hu Die was absent because she went to Beiping to film a movie, and the appellee Lin Xuehuai was also absent for other reasons. Both parties were represented by lawyers. Subsequently, Judge Hu, along with Judges Shen and Han, took their seats. Lawyers E and Ni then proceeded to state the reasons for disagreeing with the original judgment and requesting an appeal. First, regarding the debt portion, it was said that Hu claimed that Lin owed various amounts to the Butterfly Company, but the company was opened by Hu's father, Shao Gong. If Hu claimed creditor's rights, she must first obtain a power of attorney from her father, but she did not go through this procedure and sued Lin, which was not in accordance with the procedure. The six hundred dollar check was collected by Lin from the bank on behalf of Hu, and it should have been handed over immediately after it was received. As for the car, it was actually purchased by Lin. Because there was no money for the check, it was temporarily borrowed from the Butterfly Company and then returned. All of this can be investigated. As for the termination of the engagement, the appellant had previously only made empty claims. Lawyer Zhan then replied to each section, saying that the statements made by the appellant's lawyers were all the same as those in the first instance and that there was no new evidence or new reason. Hu Shao Gong had previously stated that his property was his daughter's property, so the appellant naturally had the right to claim. As for the termination of the engagement, it was originally proposed by Lin Xuehuai. In addition to the two letters he sent to Hu, there was also a plea prepared but not submitted by his lawyer. How could he now appear to be reneging? However, Lin knew that the Butterfly Company had been destroyed by fire and the account books had been burned, yet he insisted that the accounts be investigated, which was unreasonable. The two sides' lawyers then debated the account books for a long time. Judge Hu then announced that the case would be postponed and further investigation of the evidence would be conducted.</p>
<h3>Antique Jewelry Store Robbed</h3>
<p>Everyone in the Store Driven into the Toilet</p>
<p>Losses Exceed 15,000 Dollars</p>
<p>Tian Yunbo, from Suzhou, 49 years old, opened a Huaxin Antique Store at 603 D Street, Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession, specializing in the buying and selling of diamonds, pearls, jade, and all kinds of precious timepieces. He had been in business for many years, and his career was thriving. More than half of his major customers were foreigners, so he had accumulated considerable savings. There were many employees in the store, especially servants. Unexpectedly, he was coveted by bandits. Yesterday afternoon, around 3:15 PM, three robbers dressed in blue cloth shirts and trousers suddenly broke into the store. Each drew a pistol and threatened silence. At the same time, they took out hemp ropes from their bags and tied up six employees and two maids one by one, driving them into the toilet downstairs. Then they locked the back door. At that time, a Wuxi nanny surnamed Xu from the store was returning home with the owner's five-year-old and two-year-old children after playing outside. As soon as they entered the door, they saw that there was no one in the store. They only saw three men dressed as coolies running around in front of the counter. Nanny Xu became suspicious and was about to turn around and call for help when she was stopped by a robber, slapped twice, and also confined to the toilet. The robbers then began to search. First, they smashed two glass display cases in the center of the store that contained various watch samples. Then they used a knife to pry open the tall display case containing diamonds and jade in the east and put all the items inside into the bags they brought. At that time, the bandits were still not satisfied and wanted to continue searching upstairs when a foreigner suddenly entered the store and saw that there was no one in the store. He saw the three bandits searching inside and immediately retreated. The bandits knew that things were not good, so they fled with the loot. At this time, the people confined to the toilet still did not know that the bandits had gone far. Fortunately, A Mei, a 14-year-old daughter of a maid surnamed Yan, heard the sound of glass breaking downstairs and suspected that there was a quarrel downstairs. She tiptoed to the loft to peek and saw that everything was messy and there was no one in the store. She was extremely frightened and shouted. At this time, the people who had been confined knew that the bandits had gone far and tried to open the door. They inspected the items and found that more than half had been lost. The owner then issued a list of losses and reported it to the police station. The estimated loss was more than 15,000 dollars. The police chief, considering the case to be serious, immediately ordered detectives to investigate. When the reporter went to investigate, a store employee took out a large bag of empty watch boxes and jewelry boxes that had been robbed and asked about the approximate loss. He said that it was more than 3,000 dollars. According to the store owner's wife, the store had previously hired a gatekeeper, but he was laid off on August 10. Later, a Shandong native was hired, but he was also laid off on October 14. The store's daily business hours were from around 6 PM to 8 PM, when customers usually arrived. 3 PM was a slack time. Outsiders could not have known about this situation. The fact that the robbery occurred at 3 PM definitely requires investigation.</p>
<h3>More Workers from Shenyang Arsenal Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Unspeakable Hardship</p>
<p>After Shenyang was captured, the local people were displaced and suffered great pain. Recently, workers from the arsenal in that city, due to lack of work and having spent all their savings, were about to starve to death, so they arrived in Shanghai in batches by ship. Yesterday, another batch of about sixty people arrived in Shanghai, taking the South Manchuria Railway to Yingkou and then transferring to the Yuxing steamer. They docked at the Longmao Pier in Pudong. Half of them had relatives in Shanghai and left the ship to go ashore. However, there were still more than thirty people who not only had no relatives to turn to, but also had no money to buy tickets. After arriving at the port, the captain insisted on collecting the fare. When he could not find a solution, he prevented them from going ashore. The workers then elected Wang Fengyuan and Chen Houfu as representatives and petitioned the Pudong Third District Public Security Bureau for relief. Director Zhang avoided reporting to the headquarters and informed the Social Affairs Bureau, which sent personnel to contact the shipping company to release them and then seek ways to provide relief or resettlement. The two representatives recounted the atrocities of the Japanese army and the hardships they faced in Shenyang. The following is a summary: [On the night of September 18th at 10 PM, we suddenly heard gunshots, which continued incessantly. At 12 PM, the sound of artillery began, and because it was not far away, it was deafening. It was late at night, and we did not dare to go out to see. The next morning, we got up and saw that the streets were full of Japanese soldiers. We knew that Shenyang City had fallen and was entirely within the Japanese military area. From then on, our actions were extremely restricted, and we were subjected to constant intimidation and fright. The arsenal had no work to do, and our livelihoods were cut off. Later, the Chinese organized a maintenance association, and each person could receive half a liter of rice per day. Soon, this was banned by the Japanese. We then pawned our clothes to make a living. After spending all our savings, the maintenance association obtained the consent of the Japanese army to issue each person ten yuan and a free train ticket. On the afternoon of the 14th of this month at 5 PM, we took the South Manchuria Railway to Shanghai. The Japanese in Shenyang, disregarding shame, acted as if they were a victorious country, looting, raping, and killing everywhere. They were extremely barbaric. There were more than 200 airplanes and 300 or 400 cannons in the arsenal, all of which were transported away by the Japanese. However, the rifles were still untouched. In short, the actions of the Japanese in the eastern provinces were worse than those of beasts.] As they spoke, those who heard it felt indescribable hatred.</p>
<h3>Gas Users Beware</h3>
<p>Municipal Public Works Bureau Announcement</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau issued an announcement yesterday, saying: "For the sake of the announcement, according to a letter from the Shanghai Gas Company, gas users in Fengle Lane, North Sichuan Road, and other places have recently had people posing as employees of the company, removing the lead pipes and copper fittings connecting the gas meters, causing the gas supply to be cut off. I urge this bureau to notify the police in the area to pay attention. Similar cases have also occurred in the Public Concession, and the police are investigating. Assistance is also requested. The bureau has already forwarded the request to the Public Security Bureau to order all districts in Zhabei to pay close attention to the investigation. However, gas users should pay attention to the following: when encountering people claiming to be employees of the gas company entering their homes to work, they must ask to see the credentials issued by the company. If they do not have credentials and their behavior is suspicious, they can immediately call the police to arrest them in order to prevent wrongdoers. This announcement."</p>
<h3>Han Yugeng Did Not Deposit Money in Japanese Bank</h3>
<p>It was reported some days ago that a merchant, Han Yugeng, had transferred his deposits from the Bank of Communications and Dunyu Money Exchange to a Japanese bank. It is now known that the matter has been investigated by Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, together with lawyer Qin Liankui, who examined the accounts of the Yongji Coal Company established by the merchant. There is no account of large sums of money being remitted, and there is no prior business with the Bank of Communications and Dunyu Money Exchange. This further proves the inaccuracy of the rumor.</p>
<h3>Tianci New Style Fast Steamer Inaugurated</h3>
<p>In addition to the original Chaoyang steamer, the Chongming Steamer Company in Nanshi, this port, has recently added a new Tianci fast steamer. It was built by Mr. Yang Junsheng of the Dachina Shipbuilding and Machinery Factory in Yangshupu and purchased Swedish twin-engine diesel engines from the Weichang Trading Company. It has 600 horsepower, a speed of 13 nautical miles, a length of 168 feet, a width of 30 feet, and cost more than 200,000 yuan. The car testing ceremony was held yesterday afternoon. Chairman Lu Bohong, General Manager Wang Qingmu, Assistant General Manager Chen Ganqing, Standing Directors Mao Youren and Lu Caifu, Director Lu Yigeng, and guests, including Mr. Chen Boju, director of the Shipping Association, and more than 200 people, attended the ceremony on the ship. It sailed to Wusong and returned. They were extremely satisfied with the ship's equipment and speed. It can be said to be second to none among the steamers in Nanshi.</p>
<h3>The Simplicity and Elegance of Ye Huijun's Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>The 21st of this month is the 69th birthday of Mr. Ye Huijun, a well-known figure in Shanghai. His family members, in accordance with Mr. Ye's loyal and upright spirit, and following the instructions of their elders to earnestly promote national salvation and practice thrift, held a simple and elegant birthday celebration at the Cuixiu Hall in the Town God's Temple. Apart from hanging up solicited poems and articles as decorations, no invitations were sent out, and banquets and entertainment were avoided. The birthday gifts were donated to flood relief, and only clean national products such as tea and refreshments were served. It washed away the extravagance of the world and is truly a model for society.</p>
<h3>Hanged Female Corpse Reveals Numerous Wounds on the Body</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Discovers Hidden Facts</p>
<p>Caused by Abuse and Coercion</p>
<p>Kong Wang, 44 years old, the wife of Kong Qinghao, a native of Taizhou living at 21 Qinxian Lane, Huiwen Road, Zhabei, had newly arrived in Shanghai from Jiangbei. Unexpectedly, Kong beat his wife severely over a trivial matter the other day, causing her to feel angry and hang herself in the attic. Her brother, Wang Yongtang, and others found out and gathered people to completely destroy Kong's mahogany furniture. A police officer arrived and Wang told him that his sister had been beaten to death. The police took Kong and his mother, Kong Feng, into custody at the Second Precinct of the Fifth District. However, the body had already been taken down at that time, so there was no way to prove anything. The local security guard, Ji Yitu, was ordered to report to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Wang and others arrived at the scene for the autopsy, and the family of the deceased insisted that she died from injuries. They were ordered to take the body to the hospital for a re-examination. Unexpectedly, Chen Zhi, a native of Jiangbei, came forward to strongly mediate a settlement, so yesterday the security guard refused to take the body and instead went to the court to request exemption from the autopsy. After the judge questioned him about the previous situation, it was discovered that Chen was still listening for news in front of the court. The judge ordered the bailiff to arrest him, but Chen had already left, so he was not captured. An order has been issued to investigate and arrest him. The prosecutor believed that there must be hidden facts in the case, so he returned to the scene for an autopsy. He found that although the deceased died by hanging herself, there were numerous wounds on her body, indicating that she had been abused and coerced. He therefore ordered that the defendants be detained pending investigation and handling, and that the body be collected for burial.</p>

Dr. Yan Fuqing is the director. Saline injections are given when necessary and are quite effective. These epidemic hospitals are scheduled to close on the 15th of this month. (4) The cholera epidemic in Shanghai this year can be eradicated by the end of October, as it was last year. The number of patients this year is three times higher than last year, but fortunately, the symptoms are very mild and easy to treat. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who care about hygiene will learn from the experience of this year's survey report so that the work of eradicating cholera can be expected to be more effective next year. (5) The epidemic situation in Hankou has decreased. The quarantine procedures for ships arriving from that port have been changed. From the 15th of this month, all ships arriving in Shanghai from Hankou, except those carrying infected passengers or deaths, will be exempt from port (Wusong) quarantine and can proceed directly to Huangpu.</p>
<h3>Refusal of the Anti-Drug Association Regarding Anesthetic Drug Institutions</h3>
<p>Drug Monopoly is a Heinous Policy Leading to National Ruin</p>
<p>Managing Institutions Are In Fact Disguised Monopolies</p>
<p>Facing National Crisis, Self-Strengthening Through Drug Refusal is the Right Path</p>
<p>If We Don't Rein in at the Brink, National Ruin is Imminent</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, considering the recent resolution by the State Council to establish general and branch management institutions for anesthetic drugs, fears that a disguised monopoly plan may be revived. In addition to submitting a request to the National Government for clarification, it is also notifying national anti-drug organizations to pay close attention. The letter to anti-drug organizations in various regions is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully, we have read in the newspapers that Article 2 of the State Council's resolution on the 13th states: "The Anti-Opium Committee reported that the regulations for the management of anesthetic drugs have already been promulgated, but the general and branch management institutions have not yet been designated. It is requested that the Ministry of Interior be instructed to establish the general and branch management institutions for anesthetic drugs as soon as possible, in accordance with the regulations. It is resolved to proceed accordingly." We are extremely astonished. The complete prohibition of opium and all anesthetic drugs is the teaching of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and stipulated in the Kuomintang's platform, as well as repeatedly announced by the government to the whole country. Previously, Wu Liande advocated for an opium monopoly, and Li Jihong proposed selling land to collect taxes, euphemistically calling it the Anti-Opium Investigation Bureau. For a time, land and opium merchants celebrated, and corrupt officials danced with joy. The atmosphere of seeking personal gain prevailed throughout the country, and the image of national and racial extinction was before our eyes. The people were disheartened, and foreign enemies laughed. Fortunately, the National Government understood the people's suffering and immediately ordered its cancellation, preventing slanderous words from taking effect and saving the prohibition laws from being abandoned. However, those who advocate for a monopoly have not given up their evil intentions and are innovating their methods. They have a plan to manage anesthetic drugs under a false name, in order to achieve the purpose of a disguised monopoly. For a time, the idea of an anesthetic drug management office was rife, and people in various regions opposed this plan, which was no different from a disguised monopoly. The authorities also made responsible statements that the government would absolutely abide by the late Premier's teachings on drug refusal, which reassured the people. The opium monopoly is a poisonous scheme by imperialists to harm and destroy the people of our country. Tracing back to when Taiwan was ceded to Japan, Goto Shinpei, the Director of the Sanitation Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Interior, advocated for implementing a monopoly to control the fate of the Taiwanese people. Our country has not yet fallen, yet there are people who have lost their minds and are advocating for a monopoly under the guise of "curved line prohibition." Their suggestions are simply picking up the leftovers of Goto Shinpei to poison their own compatriots. Is this not what is meant by "when a country is about to perish, there will be evil omens"? Now that foreign insults are pressing, and the country is in danger, all of us should devote our full strength to preparing for national salvation. Yet, we are eagerly taking measures to establish anesthetic drug management institutions. Although the content is unknown, given the previous rumors and the fact that it is now being realized, and that those in charge are none other than those who advocate for and support a monopoly, its actual purpose is conceivable. How is it different from the Anti-Opium Investigation Bureau, which was hated by the whole country? Today, national ruin is imminent, and we should encourage self-strengthening. Such a poisonous root that harms the people and the country should be eradicated completely. How can we tolerate its existence, let alone establish management institutions to facilitate its sale? Since the cancellation of the Anti-Opium Investigation Bureau, special taxes in Hunan and Hubei have continued, and Anhui has followed suit. Those who advocate for a monopoly transport large quantities of opium soil from Shanghai to Dalian to avoid the eyes and ears of the people, and then sell it inland. Considering all these facts, there is clearly no sincerity in prohibiting opium. The establishment of general and branch management institutions for anesthetic drugs is even more incomprehensible and arouses suspicion. Our association loves the party and the country and is pained by the disaster of opium. In this time of national crisis, we believe that the above-mentioned resolutions are absolutely unacceptable. In addition to requesting the anti-opium authorities to provide a clear explanation, we urge anti-drug comrades in various regions to pay close attention and supervise together to permanently eliminate the root of disguised monopoly and firmly establish the foundation of self-strengthening. As the saying goes, "People must insult themselves before others insult them; a country must attack itself before others attack it." We take the maintenance of opium prohibition as our mission, and how can we not feel the same way about this matter? We must not forget to refuse drugs because of the national crisis, and we must not forget the national crisis because of drug refusal. By considering both, we can hope for the future of our country.</p>

<h3>Dr. Yang Yanhe's Medical Achievements</h3>

He has particularly gained the trust of the workers of the Chinese Electric Car Company while practicing at the Chinese Hospital. The wife of Mr. Wang Hanliang, a leader in the local antique industry, previously suffered from severe dysentery with excruciating abdominal pain, experiencing thirty to forty bowel movements day and night. After treatment by Dr. Yang, the dysentery was reduced after one dose, and the pain subsided after a second dose, leading to a complete recovery. It is reported that Dr. Yang's consultation fees are particularly low, and the extremely poor receive free treatment, along with discount coupons for half-price medication.</p>
<h3>Report on the Burial of Exhumed Remains in Jiangsu and Zhejiang by the Pushan Villa</h3>
<p>The Pushan Villa has been handling the burial of exposed remains in the areas bordering Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Over the past four years, it has buried a total of 46,835 remains. The expenses have always been raised by Director Wang Junsheng through solicitations from various philanthropists. Director Wang has been working on this matter for years, not only exerting great effort but also fulfilling his obligations to the best of his ability. The previous undertaking in the tenth district of Wujiang County and the Jiaxing area was extremely tragic. It was unbearable to see the remains exposed and in urgent need of burial. Due to insufficient funds at the time, Mr. Wang Yiting generously donated 3,856 yuan from his father's and grandmother's centennial celebration. Director Wang also donated all 2,068 yuan from the wedding of his younger brother's fifth son, Ji Zhou, and Miss Jiang Shaozhi, to the cause. The funding was exhausted, and it was not easy to persevere. This winter's burial work has started early and is continuing. It began on October 9 and is intended to be a regular operation until next spring. The estimated expenses are very high. If fundraising is not done in advance, there will be no funds for next spring, and the work will inevitably be halted halfway. We urge comrades and philanthropists from all walks of life to be compassionate and generously donate to ensure the continuation of the burial work, so that exposed remains can be laid to rest, emphasizing humanity and sanitation, which will be of great merit to the region.</p>

<h3>Reader Communication</h3>
<p>Mr. Cai Nianci's Message (Seven Admonitions to the People)</p>
<p>Dear friends, the Japanese invaders are rampant, and we must seek survival in death. From today onwards, please keep the following maxims in mind, and please copy and send them to relatives and friends to encourage each other. Perseverance is especially important. Please do not laugh at my superficiality. If everyone relies on their conscience, is down-to-earth, and works diligently, the Japanese invaders will be eradicated in five years. (1) From today onwards, recognize the Japanese invaders as our only enemy and promote this to relatives and friends at all times, especially instilling national humiliation deeply into the minds of young people and children, so that they are constantly inspired. (2) From today onwards, determine your aspirations, develop an upward spirit, and strive for progress in your career and studies. No matter what, strive to become a useful person for the country and ensure that my career and studies directly or indirectly benefit the country and society. Eliminate the bad habits of being dispirited, following conventions, seeking comfort, and stealing a living. Lie on firewood and taste gall, endure hardship and encourage oneself, and vow to make it our mission to avenge national humiliation. Persevere in this and do not give up halfway. (3) From today onwards, strongly advise family and friends to use only domestic goods and strictly prohibit the purchase of Japanese goods. Persist to the end and never relax, especially avoiding deceiving oneself and others, appearing to comply but secretly opposing. (4) From today onwards, strive to improve the health of your body and learn sports, boxing, or military tactics to prepare for the foundation of sacrificing yourself for the country in the future. (5) From today onwards, drastically reduce gambling, debauchery, smoking, drinking, and all useless consumption, and privately or publicly save it as a national salvation fund to prepare for the country's unexpected needs. (6) From today onwards, strive to pray for the realization of national peace, strive to promote the development of national production, and strive to invent tactical goods and crafts to contribute to the country. Anything that can make the country rich and strong, do your best to do it, regardless of how big or small, and go through fire and water without hesitation. (7) If war is declared against Japan this time, the entire nation should unite and face the national crisis together. Anyone with blood should volunteer to kill the enemy, with the minimum requirement that each person can kill one Japanese invader. Cai Nianci urges with tears, from Jinggang Post Office.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Reply from the Shanghai Local Cloth Industry Association to a Fellow Merchant (Part) On the 12th of this month, we received a letter full of patriotic enthusiasm, which is admirable. There is nothing new or old in starting a business. What matters is the livelihood of the poor. Our industry and the pawn industry are at the top of the list. Even precious things like jade are only for the decoration of wealthy families, and ginseng is only for the nourishment of the wealthy, having nothing to do with the poor. Old industries like salted goods and fruits can all maintain the lives of the poor, and new businesses like sweets can also provide a livelihood for the poor. This is the argument for what is beneficial and what is not. Our industry has always adhered to the principle of concession. However, our position is closely related to the poor. We have repeatedly strived for tax exemptions in order to reduce the burden on the poor, and fortunately, our goal has been achieved, which is a source of consolation. However, factory cloth is becoming increasingly popular, and people are still curious about it. Our industry is already in the midst of natural elimination. The mentality of maintaining the livelihood of the poor is still undiminished for those engaged in this business. Such is our position. There are few capitalists, partners, and children from our industry who study abroad, and there are few people who import new foreign knowledge. Every time we encounter something, there is a lack of design talent, making it extremely difficult to select people. Your criticism is not excessive. Our association is a committee system, and regular meetings are held on the 6th and 21st of each month. Please come to our office to attend and discuss in detail. If there is a solution, we will accommodate it as much as possible. Sincerely, Regarding the issue of advocating for the establishment of a volunteer army in the previous letter, please have your newspaper publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Please correct us, Mr. Editor-in-Chief of the Shen Bao, Shanghai Local Cloth Industry Association, October 19, 20th year,</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Shen Bao, I am writing to you because I read a news item in your paper this month, on the 18th, titled "Overseas Chinese Li Yuxuan Returns to China Seeking a Wife, Dispute Arises" that has inaccuracies. The news item states: "Li Yuxuan, because he is not familiar with the local language, asked Zhang to inquire…" It also states that "Zhang Zhimou was also arrested." Shao Yuefeng, the president of Shao Academy, has been in Southeast Asia for many years and has known Mr. Li for a long time. The matter of seeking a wife was originally entrusted directly to Mr. Shao by Mr. Li. However, Zhimou and Mr. Li lived together in Room 244 of the New World Hotel. When Mr. Li entrusted Mr. Shao, I happened to be present. On the evening of the 16th, I went to visit Mr. Shao at the Guangshan Hospital, and I learned that Mr. Shao had been arrested by the police. At that time, out of friendship, I wanted to find out what had happened, so I went to inquire. The police asked me what I was doing there, and I answered truthfully. At that time, the police learned that I was a friend of Li, so they ordered me to go to the office to explore the ins and outs of the case in order to corroborate it. Therefore, in fact, I was not arrested. Zhimou believes that he has been in the education field in Southeast Asia for more than ten years and has never had any false behavior. This matter concerns my reputation, so please publish the original letter in your newspaper to clarify the truth. I hope that your editor will uphold justice and distinguish right from wrong and will be happy to grant this request. Sincerely, Zhang Zhimou, October 19, 20th year,</p>

<h3>Heartfelt Words</h3>
<p>-- Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, when we go to Suzhou to visit Tiger Hill, when we walk on the Stone of a Thousand People, do we not always remember the myth of "Master Sheng preaching and the stubborn stones nodding"? Stubborn stones are originally ignorant and unconscious things, but they will nod when they hear Master Sheng's preaching. Unexpectedly, Japan, which claims to be a civilized country in the world, is not even as good as a stubborn stone. The League of Nations invited the United States to attend and jointly preach like Master Sheng, but Japan, this particularly stubborn stone, has never been moved. Compatriots, we are now just like being pressed under this particularly large stubborn stone, unable to move. How should we use all our strength to push down this stubborn stone and smash it to pieces, to wash away the shame of being suppressed for decades?</p>
<p>But Not Removing the Garden Grass, Zhaifu Tan Hui</p>
<h3>Tao Xingzhi's Colors</h3>
<p>Last year, Tao Xingzhi was wanted by the central government on the charge of colluding with rebels. The rebel probably refers to Feng Yuxiang. The uniform of the Northwest Army is blue. After the wanted order was issued, the capital immediately gave him the title of "Blue Xingzhi." Hu Zhantang gave a speech in the Legislative Yuan, saying that he was a nationalist, and suddenly put a black national essence party gown on him. A few months later, a dozen communists were arrested among the Xiaozhuang students, so the rumor of Tao Xingzhi's redization spread throughout the capital. At this time, the black clothes Zhantang gave him immediately turned red. Friends were worried and repeatedly asked him, saying: "Are you ultimately blue, black, or red?" He said: "I can deny everything. My veins are blue; my hair is black; my blood is red."</p>
<h3>The Patriot of Japanese Culture Over the Past Two Hundred Years</h3>
<p>— Wang Shaozeng</p>
<p>Japan was an ancient Wa (dwarf) nation. In the early years of Emperor Xianheng of the Tang Dynasty, its name was changed to Japan, named for its proximity to the sunrise in the Eastern Sea. [The land is surrounded by the sea, with only the northeast bounded by large mountains, including the Five Provinces and Seven Circuits, and Three Islands.] (History of the Ming Dynasty, Biography of Japan) Examining the relationship between China and Japan, it budded in the Qin and Han dynasties, flourished in the Sui and Tang dynasties, became friendly in the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties, broke apart in the Yuan dynasty, and was disturbed in the Ming dynasty. Since the Qing dynasty, there has been endless aggression. Today, people in our country are beginning to pay attention to Japanese culture. Japan is only separated from Korea by the Tsushima Strait, a narrow strip of water. Therefore, its observation and learning of culture from China accounted for nine out of ten. This was especially prominent during the flourishing Tang Dynasty. However, since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has transformed from weak to strong, progressing rapidly and reforming all aspects of its administration without leaving any effort unspared. By the era of Emperor Xuanzong, it had won against China in one war, against Russia in another, swept through Ryukyu and Taiwan, and swallowed Korea and Southern Manchuria. From a small island nation, it leaped to become one of the world's great powers. Especially with the flourishing of science, news travels from Europe in the morning to Japan by evening, and it continues to strive tirelessly. Commentators all attribute its success to saving the nation through science, but they do not know that the rise of culture in the past two hundred years owes much to the education of the great Confucian scholar Mr. Zhu Shunshui of the late Ming Dynasty. Mr. Shunshui's name was Zhiyu, his courtesy name was Luyu, and he was from Yuyao, Zhejiang. He was a Ming Dynasty student. Along with Wang Yangming and Huang Lizhou, he was known as one of the three great scholars of Yuyao, opening up a rare flourishing in history. Shunshui and Lizhou were contemporaries, and he was truly a second-generation disciple of Yangming, so he deeply embraced the teachings of the unity of knowledge and action. I often heard Taicang Tang Weizhi speak of him as a teacher, and my classmate Zhu Gongshu was also a fellow townsman of Mr. Zhu, so I heard about him in even more detail. At the end of the Chongzhen era, Mr. Zhu was twice summoned to office.</p>
<h3>Anti-Ascension Poem</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Amidst the sounds of national crisis, there are still those who compose elegant gatherings and write poems about the joy of climbing high. Therefore, I write this poem to admonish them.</p>
<p>What kind of person is Huan Jing, who avoids disaster in reverse? Climbing high and ascending to dangerous places is too hasty. How can the words of Fei Changfang be trusted? How do you know that the chickens and dogs are not hiding? The dogwood, the wine, and the immortal spirits on the mountain, how can they compare with the strength of divine power? Thus, it is known that there has been much fabrication since ancient times, and the written records are vague and distant. Moreover, it is a time when the red leaves are brilliant after frost, and the yellow chrysanthemums bloom in the eastern hedge. The cold fragrance overflows and permeates the nose, and the wind blows each flower, releasing its fragrance. In the past, Tao Yuanming did not leave his place and was drunk with wine, unable to forget. Seeing this good festival is not easy, and often wind and rain fill the city. This year, although the heavens are beautiful, the scorching sun rises from Japan. There is no time to enjoy ourselves, and the government and people are all terrified. Why ask Wang Bo to write a preface? Why ask if Liu Kun has the Double Ninth cake? Look at the terrain, the southeast is sunken, and the northwest rises high, separated by the Tianjin Bridge. Nüwa, the creator, only patched the sky, not the earth, and this year's floods are vast. Three parts of earth and five parts of water form the high mountains connected to the sky. Climbing those mountains is in vain, and the giant spirit split the earth in primordial times. Have you not heard that the Himalayas are the highest peaks, and even with long strides, they cannot be fully measured? Yuanlong has boundless courage and looks around with wide eyes, the sky is low and high. He swallows eighteen or nineteen parts of the world in his chest, and all the mountains are hidden under his feet at a glance. Knowing that high and low have no fixed shape, how can they be compared between the past and the present? Don't you see airplanes flying straight up, soaring like birds in the sky? Looking down, the earth is small and insignificant, so stop saying that humans are just restless. You must know that standing tall is noble when one is humble, and a tree that is too high is damaged by the wind. Living in the world, one should maintain balance, and leaping forward will lead to stiffness. The great wind is vast, and the great tide is torrential. If you are not superior, you are inferior, and if you do not prosper, you perish. Natural selection in the struggle for survival is inevitable, and strong neighbors press close on all sides. If the mountains could be used to avoid disaster, the whole earth would be in trouble today. I say that superstition is the most deceiving, and that unintentional and unconscious are truly distant and vague. Just look at the Eastern neighbors, who are acting wildly, and the blades of their weapons shine brightly in the sky over Liaoning. If everyone has the strength to defend themselves, they can wipe out this strange shame on the broad road. A hundred-foot platform rises from the ground, not facing the sun on the five mountains. As long as one has one heart and one virtue, glorious slogans can be posted on the high walls. It depends on the people quickly becoming aware, not on the power of the central government. I write this poem and want to dance, and in an instant, the spirit is shaken and stirred again.</p>
<p>During the time of Prince Fu, he was recommended and appointed as the Vice Surveillance Commissioner of Jiangxi, but he declined both times. When the Qing army captured Nanjing, he relied on Huang Bingqing in Zhoushan and requested troops from Japan. They agreed, but the troops were not sent. When Zhoushan fell, he wandered between Japan and Jiaozhi. Later, he corresponded with Zhang Huangyan and Chen Hui's armies. When the cause failed, he went to Japan again. Tokugawa Mitsukuni, the lord of Mito in Japan, treated him with the respect due to a national teacher. However, the request for troops was never fulfilled. So he lectured in Japan and died there in melancholy. From this, the study of Chinese Neo-Confucianism in Japan greatly flourished. From the court to the common people, all respected and admired him. The doctrine of the unity of knowledge and action was also greatly advocated in Japan. The Japanese mentality of [knowing and acting] became firmly rooted and could not be uprooted. To this day, there are dozens or hundreds of writings on the study of Wang Yangming's doctrines. On the other hand, in our country's bookstores, it is impossible to save the fine edition of the complete works of Yangming, let alone other books. I believe that Japan has such a national spirit today, and it is necessary to give credit to Mr. Zhu. This is something that Japanese historians all acknowledge. Mr. Zhu was proficient in the Six Classics, and there was nothing he did not understand. He only had the ambition to restore the Ming Dynasty, but he did not fulfill his wish to serve the country, and eventually drifted to a foreign land. Talents from Chu were used in Jin. His ambition was bitter, and his integrity was high. However, more than two hundred years after Mr. Zhu's death, Japan has been despising China and threatening us endlessly. Thinking of Mr. Zhu's noble character, how can we not feel resentful? The Jinan Massacre and the blood and tears of Liaodong were also unexpected by Mr. Zhu. Today, Mr. Shunshui's collected works are circulating in the world, and Japanese scholars have posthumously honored him as "Vengong (cultured and respectful)"</p>
<h3>Suffering Because of Dwarfs</h3>
<p>— Lu Shifang</p>
<p>There is a saying in the folk proverbs of Kunshan, "Suffering because of dwarfs." I didn't know the origin of this saying at first. Later, when I read the local chronicles, I learned the origin of this saying. It was actually directed at the Japanese. The Japanese were originally called the "Dwarf Country." During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, the Japanese pirates were rampant, invading and harassing the coastal counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The area around Suzhou and Songjiang suffered greatly. Our Kunshan was also among the areas affected. The Japanese pirates landed from the sea dikes of Baoshan and went straight into the city. The county magistrate, hearing the news, closed the city gates early and strictly forbade anyone from being lowered down the walls. The common people's rice and vegetables were all taken by the officials and soldiers. People near the suburbs, supporting the old and leading the young, cried out at the gates, but no one on the city walls responded. They only watched them being tormented under the blades of the pirates and said that they would hook up suspected people as spies and slaughter them. The people who suffered grievances had no way to complain, and many did not die at the hands of the pirates alone. However, if it were not for the invasion of the Japanese pirates, how could they have suffered this unwarranted disaster? I read Mr. Gui Youguang's Collection and saw a poem called "Maritime Affairs," written about the Japanese pirates' rebellion. One of them said, "The stench of the sea cannot be smelled, and the killing air in the eastern suburbs is dense every day. The magistrate has his own solid defense, and he can bear to let our people feed the pirate army." This is probably a poem about this matter. This is why the people have thought about the pain, so there is a saying "Suffering because of dwarfs," which has been passed down to this day. Now, the Japanese pirates have seized our three eastern provinces, robbing, killing, raping, and doing everything. The suffering of our people because of the dwarfs is even greater than before.</p>
<p>Also, according to the local chronicles, during the Japanese pirates' rebellion, our Kunshan had a deputy prefect named Ren and a garrison commander named Liang. One bravely killed the pirates, and the other fled at the first sign of trouble. Mr. Gui Youguang also wrote a poem about this matter. The words are stern and the meaning is upright, deeply expressing the poet's intention to praise and criticize. Now, I have excerpted two poems below. Those generals and officials who guarded the land were captured without resistance when the enemy arrived, willingly abandoning the territory, and yet they still shamelessly claimed the beautiful name of non-resistance to deceive the people. I don't know if they feel ashamed in their hearts when they read Mr. Gui's poems.</p>
<p>The poem says, "The island barbarians also love treasures. Why should the magistrate flee so deeply? He has a plan to save his life from the pirates, and he can spend ten thousand gold coins on the bed." "He lightly dressed in white silk and said he was leading troops. How could he care for his life if he could die ten thousand times? Even children know that Prefect Ren is there, and he makes a golden city on the sea."</p>
<h3>A Record of the Loyal Souls Monument of Japanese Soldiers in Qingdao</h3>
<p>— Nangongsheng</p>
<p>Qingdao was leased to the Germans during the late Qing Dynasty. They spared no effort in its development, making it a magnificent sight. When the European War broke out, the Japanese</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Passing Through Zhengzhou (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Di Jian'an</p>
<p>The weather is extremely cold in the winter months. People are wearing cotton clothes now. A few days ago, they were still wearing single-layered clothes. The changes in temperature are very rapid. There is very little rain. It often doesn't rain for several months. There is a lot of dust and sand. When it is windy, it is inconvenient to go out because the dust and sand rise with the wind, making it difficult to open one's eyes. It is often impossible to see the person standing opposite. Historical sites include the Mausoleum of Emperor Shizong of Zhou and the tomb of Pei Jingong in the city, the tomb of Zhou Bo in the northwest of the county, and the East Lake and Phoenix Terrace in the east of the county. Scenic spots include Longhai Park and the Martyrs' Shrine. Products include wheat, sorghum, cotton, dates, sesame, peanuts, Yali pears, and persimmon cakes. Among them, cotton is the most important. Cotton from Shaanxi and northern Henan is gathered and distributed in</p>
<p>Zhengzhou. It is estimated that more than 1.5 million dan are traded each year. This year, the cotton production in Henan Province is still considered abundant. It is estimated that there are about 700,000 dan, and this does not include Shaanxi. The cotton merchants here are slightly different from those in the Jiangnan region. There are 14 cotton firms, most of which are intermediary merchants. Their business is to introduce customers from all directions to sellers, and to connect with factories or cotton firms that handle goods, acting as intermediaries for buying and selling. Therefore, they do not need much capital. However, in recent years, some capitalists have also lent money to sellers in advance. When cotton appears on the market, their business scope is larger. Transportation companies are very developed. There are 50 to 60 companies engaged in this business. Warehousing is also well-developed. Brothels are everywhere, all along the Hebei area. It is said that there are 200 to 300 houses. Both Suzhou and local brothels are available. The reason for their development is that Zhengzhou is an important transportation hub, and merchants from all directions gather here. Therefore, this industry has also flourished as a result. Financial institutions include the Bank of China, Central Bank, Shanghai Bank, Communications Bank, and Jin Cheng Bank, each with branches here. There are also local silver houses (not called Qianzhuang). Paper currency is in circulation on the market, and it is issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Siming Bank. Other currencies are not very useful. There is also the Henan Agricultural and Industrial Bank, which issues copper coin notes, in denominations of ten, twenty, fifty, eighty, and one hundred coins. One silver dollar can be exchanged for 4,800 cash. There are also four types of copper coins: 20-cash, 50-cash, 100-cash, and 200-cash. Small exchange shops are all set up in the open air, placed in a lead wire cage, guarded by one person. I often jokingly refer to these small Qianzhuang in the cages as "being in an island cage." There is the Yu Feng Cotton Mill, located east of the train station. I once visited it. It has 55,000 spindles. The factory has been shut down for a long time and is now restarting on the second of this month. Currently, 20,000 spindles are running. More will be started up in succession. There is a fountain pool, which is quite a sight. The reason for this is that the machines require water, and there are no rivers in Zhengzhou. Therefore, a pool was specially built to hold water, with countless sprinkler pipes. The water is sprayed from the sprinkler pipes, cooled, and then reused. There are more than ten hotels, including the Jin Tai Ying Bin Guan, Tian Bao Lao Zhan, and the French Hotel. Chicken prices are quite cheap, only about thirty cents per chicken. But their weight is only one or two pounds.</p>
<p>seized Qingdao by taking advantage of the Germans' inability to attend to the east. Qingdao is our country's territory, not the Germans'. Although it was leased, the territorial rights still belong to our country. The Japanese used the pretext of attacking the Germans to seize Qingdao, which is our country's territory. It can be seen how much they insulted our country's sovereign rights. The Germans defended Qingdao because of the excellent fortresses, the bravery of the soldiers, and the sophistication of the equipment. Although the Japanese launched a large-scale attack, they ultimately failed. Therefore, they violated our country's declaration of neutrality and landed at Longkou, attacking Qingdao by land. At that time, our country only declared neutrality and had not joined the Allied Powers. The Japanese wanted to seize our Qingdao and violated our neutrality. They regarded our country's national power as if they did not see it. Later, the Germans retreated, and the Japanese occupied Qingdao. Many soldiers died in battle. Therefore, they erected the Loyal Souls Monument to bury the remains of the Japanese soldiers. Qingdao has now been returned to our country, but the Loyal Souls Monument still stands majestically in our country's territory. It is a disgrace that the monument to the loyal souls of another country exists in our own territory.</p>
<p>The monument is located near the Huiquan Fort, and a winding path leads to it, about half a mile away. The monument is seven or eight feet high, with the three large characters "Loyal Souls Monument" engraved on it. Beside it, it recounts the achievements of the attack on Qingdao at that time, as well as the surnames and numbers of the dead. Behind the monument is a mound, topped with stone. The project was huge and required several months of work to complete. What is buried in it are the remains of those who had aggressive ambitions and wanted to occupy our country's territory. The Japanese regard them as the remains of patriotic heroes, while we regard them as our greatest enemies.</p>
<p>The Japanese have a special reverence for the Loyal Souls Monument. Every time a warship arrives in Qingdao, they go to the monument to pay their respects. Their respect and reverence in their hearts are unparalleled. Before our country took back Qingdao, the Qingdao consul would lead the Japanese residents to pay their respects and make offerings every spring and autumn. Since the Washington Conference forced them to return our country, this ceremony has gradually been abolished. However, every time the Japanese go to the monument, they still pay their most respectful respects. Their expression of patriotism can be seen from this. How do they regard our country?</p>

<h3>The Pestle of Knocking on Dreams (18)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>"China's material civilization has made great progress in recent years." The architect Zhao Meiting expressed this opinion while admiring the buildings on both sides.</p>
<p>"If the world's material civilization were to make rapid progress every day, but China did not, then foreign observation groups would immediately know that this is a country without progress. According to my Zhao Meiting's view, the country wants face, and the cities and towns want appearance! For example, this road and the construction of the buildings on both sides are not bad, but the number of buildings in the country that are comparable to these is probably only the smallest number of the smallest number, so it cannot earn face for the country! We who study architecture are like plastic surgeons who use expanding methods; everything must start with tidying up the city appearance, town appearance, and village appearance! There must be city appearances, town appearances, and village appearances so that we can earn face for the country and keep pace with all countries in the world on the path of material civilization. Without destruction, there can be no construction; those buildings and bridges that do not conform to the architectural style must be sacrificed under the widening razor of the plastic surgeon."</p>
<p>"To implement your plastic surgery theory, there must be a prerequisite!" The thinker Qian Lanxuan began to raise this point, followed by his own argument:</p>
<p>"What prerequisite? For example, if you want to give someone plastic surgery, you must first cure that person's body! If that person's body has not left the hospital, it is futile to give him plastic surgery every day! Plastic surgery is certainly important, but curing the body is especially important, which is called a prerequisite. What plagues the villages and towns is the rampant disease of bandits. The bandits must be eliminated before the town and village appearances can be tidied up. Otherwise, if the villages and towns are occupied by bandits, it would be a waste of construction funds, and the result would be giving plastic surgery to the bandits. What plagues the cities is the weak dikes. The dikes must be strengthened before the city appearances can be tidied up. Otherwise, if the cities are flooded, it would be a waste of construction funds, and the result would be giving plastic surgery to the river god."</p>
<p>"Brother Lanxuan's argument is not a prerequisite either!" Tao Chihu suddenly voiced this rebuttal.</p>
<p>"According to my Tao Chi's argument, there are prerequisites within prerequisites, which is a method of self-defense. For example, if a person's body is healthy and his appearance is clean, but he lacks a method of self-defense, there will still be many dangers! According to Brother Lanxuan's argument, the scattered bandits have been eliminated, the dikes have been strengthened, and the cities, towns, and villages have substantial buildings. However, the local bandits have been eliminated, but the external bandits have not been eliminated; the domestic dikes have been strengthened, but the international dikes have not been strengthened. Then the buildings built with painstaking effort over time will only be 'making wedding clothes for others'! If we want to preserve our beautiful mountains and rivers and the buildings built with painstaking effort over time, everyone must have the qualifications of a military citizen and be able to unanimously resist foreign aggression..."</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets' Decline Remains Unsettled</h3>
<p>The price fell further by four taels after initially trending up and then weakening. Yesterday, the gold price continued to decline. There were some hidden elements, but it initially rose and then weakened, with a total of thirteen taels of fluctuations. Dealers' sentiments turned from stable to uncertain. Finally, the price fell further by four taels. The price trended higher in the morning, likely due to the rise in silver prices. Later, trading by speculators became active, leading to a softening. Foreign exchange rates remained stable. Subsequently, rumors of turmoil in the Japanese cabinet spread, along with news that the Shanghai Stock Exchange might not list East Asian exchange rates, creating a situation with prices but no market. These reports triggered a negative atmosphere in the market. Selling pressure was strong, leading to a shortage of drafts. As a result, prices plummeted by more than ten taels, suddenly falling to six hundred and eighty-five taels. Afterwards, it slightly recovered by three taels.</p>
<p>Silver prices rose. Opening price increased by one tael. The opening price in the morning was six hundred and ninety-three taels and a half, slightly higher by one tael. The large-scale price on the previous day increased by sixteen and three-eighths of a cent, but the silver price only increased by one-eighth, so people's sentiment was stable. Qian Changxiang, Da Decheng, Yu He, and others bought in, immediately pushing the price up to ninety-eight taels. There was only a fluctuation of a little over one tael. Soon after, Tong Taichang and Yu Da sold, suddenly pushing the price down to four taels and seven or eight cents. At that time, it was pulled up two taels again. The British gold market revealed no change, but the US dollar was listed at 32.125, so the gold price held. At that time, it was about ninety-six taels. Soon after, small traders sold off, slightly reducing the price by more than one tael. At 9:50, the price was ninety-four taels and two cents. Suddenly, it rebounded by three taels. Heng Yu, Da Decheng, Yuan Mao, and Yong Jun bought in. Huabi and Citibank absorbed the one-two month US dollar at 32.6875. British gold mutually settled at 180.625. At 10:15, it was ninety-seven taels and three cents. Afterwards, Tong Taichang, Yuan Heng, Tian Feng Yong, and others all came out, but the US dollar still required 32.75 to sell. British gold could be settled at 180.625. There was also a rumor that there was an error in the US gold reserves, and there was fear of closing and not allowing outflow. Therefore, the gold price immediately fell by more than four taels. At 11:30, it was ninety-three taels. Soon after, Da Decheng, Yuan Mao, and speculators rushed to buy, raising the price by a two tael count. The closing price at noon was ninety-five taels and seven cents, and then it was made to six taels and zero cents. The listed price was changed to seven hundred and fifty-three or four taels, with a difference of sixty taels.</p>
<p>The market atmosphere was tense, and selling pressure was high. The afternoon opening price was ninety-six taels, followed by six taels and five cents. However, the Indian exchange rate reported an increase of eight annas. Da Decheng, Tong Taichang, and others sold off, and Mitsui offered February British gold at 180.625. Then, McGarry bought it at 181.875 to 125. China offered the December US dollar at 32.75, causing the price to fall by two taels. At almost 3 o'clock, it was ninety-four taels and four cents. At that time, the Netherlands and others absorbed it at 32.75, adding it back to ninety-five taels and six or seven cents. After 3:15, it was suddenly heard that there would be a meeting on silver prices, and it was also said that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation listed Japanese gold, or that there would be no market. (Hang Nami is a transliteration). As a result, people were suddenly shocked. Da Decheng, Qian Changxiang, Zhi Feng Yong, and Tong Taichang enthusiastically sold off, and Huabi offered December British gold at 181.125, causing the price to plummet to seven taels. At 3:30, it was eighty-eight taels and a half. Soon after, it added two taels and a half, and then fell again. Qian Changxiang, Yuan Xing Yong, Run Changyu, Da Decheng, and others bravely disposed of their goods. The market atmosphere was bad, and the price continued to fall by six taels. At 4 o'clock, it was eighty-five taels. The Dalian gang slightly bought in, a little over three taels, at eighty-eight taels and eight cents. McGarry absorbed March British gold at 18.1875. The closing price at 4:30 was eighty-eight taels and three cents, down four taels and two cents compared to last Saturday.</p>

The Dalian gang entered more than 600 bars and exited 100 bars. The Guangdong gang exited slightly more than 100 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Finally Softened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC list had slight changes, but the British, Dutch, and Singaporean exchanges did not move. The US dollar increased by 1.25, to 32 yuan. (which is a squeezing exchange rate), the French franc added one yuan, the Indian exchange rate decreased by half a yuan, the German exchange rate decreased by one mark, and Hong Kong decreased by 3.75, to 77 taels and 7.5 cents. The internal market was initially stable and then loosened because the gold market suddenly showed weakness in the afternoon. Various negative news about gold prices came from abroad. It was said that there would be a silver price conference, and that the Japanese political situation was chaotic. It was also rumored that various countries were planning an economic boycott of Japan. This caused panic in the market. Therefore, the foreign exchange market had a linked relationship. The result was that the British gold exchange increased by 0.0625 compared to the end of last week, and the US dollar increased by 0.1875. There were few transactions by Chinese merchants, and only 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, which seemed to be a slight consolidation. About 700,000 to 800,000 yuan of US dollars were generally sold off to cash in gold. Banks such as HSBC and McGarry were still interested in buying, and the US dollar was equivalent to three taels, one cent, and two and a half cents of silver per yuan, which was cheaper than last Saturday.</p>
<p>British exchange rate The internal market had 1.125 fluctuations. The asking price in the morning was one shilling, eight pence, and 125, and the buying price was 1875. Huabi offered and McGarry entered into a mutual transaction for the May price of 180.625. East Asia offered the same price for February. The noon closing price was flat. In the afternoon, Mitsui first offered February 0.0625, McGarry bought December 181.1875 to 125, and Huabi offered 125. Mitsui and McGarry did a mutual transaction for February 125, and McGarry also bought March 181.1875. The closing asking price was 1875, the buying price was 25, the tightest was 180.625, and the loosest was 181.1875.</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in Premiums</h3>
<p>Market Overview: The current depression in the commercial market has reached its peak. Most prudent businesses are waiting for the right moment and dare not blindly follow trends. Consequently, the commercial atmosphere is extremely bleak. Therefore, apart from a general tightening, there is no good news to report in the financial sector. Yesterday, the credit crunch remained tight, but the rise and subsequent fall in foreign exchange premiums offered some comfort, though it is unlikely to last.</p>
<p>Premium Prices: [Foreign Exchange Premium] The early morning premium was 7 qian, 2 fen, 9 li, slightly down by 1 hao, 2 hu, 5 si compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market further dropped by approximately 1 li, to 7 qian, 2 fen, 7 li, 8 hao, 7 hu, 5 si, ultimately down by 1 li, 2 hao, 5 si. [Silver Premium] The morning and afternoon markets were both at 3 qian, 5 fen, up 7 fen from the previous day. "Hua Tou" also rose to around 3 qian, then to 2 qian, 5-6 fen. Bank quotes were at 1 qian, 4 fen. The situation seemed quite tense. Compared to the Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver dollars were 6 qian, 5 fen, 7 li in the morning and 6 qian, 5 fen, 7.5 li in the afternoon, similar to the previous afternoon. Transactions were 3,000 jiao in the morning and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver dollars were both 6 qian, 5 fen, 7.5 li in the morning and afternoon, with transactions of 210,000 jiao in the morning and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins were slightly short of 500 wen, at 376,000,000 wen. Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: [Silver Funds] Yesterday was Monday, and bank collections were tighter as usual, but the situation remained unchanged. Chinese merchants deposited over 3.2 million, foreign merchants deposited over 2.78 million. Various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous collections amounted to over 9.23 million. Collateral transactions were over 2 million, warehouse deposits were 1.1 million, Qianzhuang and silver public deposits were over 47.7 million, "Hua Tou" deposits were over 4.4 million, various remittances were over 900,000, and disbursements were over 1 million. [Foreign Funds] Remittance and exchange tickets were made for 1.12 million in the morning and 1.17 million in the afternoon. Banknotes were 115,000 in the morning and 85,000 in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 160,000 in the morning and 145,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions were 600,000 in the morning and 500,000 in the afternoon. Transactions between banks and foreign accounts were over 1.6 million, banknote inflow and outflow were over 2.78 million, Qianzhuang and foreign public deposits were over 5.7 million, foreign "Hua Tou" deposits were over 2.2 million, foreign exchange loans were over 1.5 million, small Qianzhuang transactions were over 600,000, inflow sources were over 300,000, and outflow stomachs were over 500,000.</p>
<h3>Handling of Long-Term Loans</h3>
<p>A considerable amount of long-term loans due by the end of this period cannot be repaid due to the poor market conditions. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. However, due to the lack of a solution, the parties involved have reconsidered the situation multiple times, but without success. As a last resort, they have postponed the matter temporarily. The long-term loans that are to be repaid in the future will be transferred to current accounts and temporarily suspended, hoping for a market recovery by the end of the year. If this is not possible, alternative solutions will have to be found. Therefore, at this crucial moment for long-term inflows and outflows at the end of the period, the news remains silent, reflecting this difficult situation. It is heard that another 1 to 2 million in loans will be due today (the 20th), and the same postponement method will likely be adopted. There is truly no new business to report. It is expected that in the future, if there are solid and reliable accounts, some adjustments may be made, but the interest rates will inevitably be slightly higher than the previous period (end of April).</p>
<p>Securities and Bond Prices Rise First, Then Fall</p>
<p>The Trend is Relatively Stable, with Fluctuations Compared to Before</p>
<p>Total Transactions Exceed 9.7 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for various bonds at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed that spot goods still had multiple listings, but trading was as sparse as before. The futures market was slightly more active than the previous day, but although multiple November futures were listed in the afternoon, transactions remained very light. The market sentiment was initially quite good, with various parties investing and taking positions, showing considerable activity. Compared to the consistent gains at the end of last week, such as the Second 20th Customs Duty, etc., had risen by over one yuan. The troop demobilization bonds had also risen by one yuan, three or four jiao. However, as sellers sold off more, the buying interest gradually subsided, and prices generally weakened. This is because the diplomatic situation is chaotic. Although the League of Nations has ordered Japan to withdraw its troops and warned China and Japan to abide by the treaty, and international public opinion has largely attacked Japan, the international situation is indeed in our favor. However, Japan's attitude remains very strong and makes many accusations, refusing to comply. In our Northeast, it continues its ambition of occupation. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether the future will avoid a break. As a result, general sentiment is also uncertain, and both bulls and bears are still watching. In the afternoon market, prices continued to weaken slightly, with minimal fluctuations. In the end, apart from the September Customs and Second 20th Customs Duty November futures rising by two or three yuan, and the Customs Duty November futures falling by three yuan and two jiao, the Customs Duty October futures also fell back by one yuan and several jiao. Other bonds had mixed gains and losses, with fluctuations only around half a yuan. Judging from the bond market situation, it is generally still considered good. Total futures transactions reached 7.2 million in the morning and only 2.5 million in the afternoon, totaling over 9.7 million yuan. Spot transactions totaled 13,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Condition Slightly Weak</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm and trending weaker. With rumors of Japanese factories suspending operations and the political situation remaining serious, there are still many buyers. However, prices are already high, and new buyers are lacking. Therefore, the market sentiment is still calm, and current yarn sales are still good, with the Guangdong group being the most active.</p>
<p>Manbiao Slightly Decreases: The Manbiao market opened with good sentiment due to rising American cotton, with each contract rising by 2.1 qian. In the afternoon, the market eased, with each contract falling by 3, 4, or 5 qian. Total transactions for the day were 28,200 bales. Rongxing sold 2,250 bales, Yiyu 2,050 bales, and Xincheng 9,500 bales. Taixing bought 1,650 bales, Changfeng 1,400 bales, Gengfeng 900 bales, and Yichang 700 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Manbiao | Closing Price | Inventory | Manbiao | Closing Price | Inventory</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>October | 163.9 (Down 4) | 56,000 | February | 161.1 (Down 2) | 107,800</p>
<p>November | 163.0 | 175,100 | March | 161.4 | 89,500</p>
<p>December | 162.2 | 101,050 | March | 161.3 | 64,200</p>
<p>Spot Transactions Still Active: Spot yarn sales are still good. Total purchases by various groups for the day were 1,800 bales, with 250 bales by fellow traders. The market is firm. Among the client groups, Guangdong bought 680 bales, inland China 450 bales, Shantou 200 bales, Jiangxi 160 bales, and miscellaneous groups 250 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Boosted by American Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market has strengthened, and prices have risen, driven by the upward trend of American cotton and positive sentiment. Most retail investors are inclined to take long positions. However, due to weak gold prices and soft exchange rates, the calculated price of foreign cotton is still cheap, and factories are still buying, with large volumes. Therefore, large traders and manufacturers are still shorting. However, with American cotton currently strong, the market is naturally boosted.</p>
<p>Hanbiao Rises by Three or Four Qian: The Hanbiao market opened with American cotton rising, and buying interest was stronger for all months, with each month rising by 2-4 qian. The afternoon was flat, down by 5 fen. However, a manufacturer from Chenxi, Shaanxi, delivered 15,000 dan for this month, suppressing the market. Total transactions for the day were 78,100 dan. Jifeng sold 5,500 dan, Yiyu 4,400 dan, Tianlong 1,700 dan, and Yuchang 1,700 dan. Dafu bought 2,400 dan, Changhe 2,300 dan, and Changfeng 5,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hanbiao Closing Price | Change | Inventory</p>
<p>------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>October | 3111 (Up 1) | 564,800</p>
<p>November | 3225 (Up 3) | 164,500</p>

<h3>British-Indian Cotton Industry Weekly</h3>
<p>Bombay: In the past week, the futures market has been firm due to continued rain in Oumra and no significant sales from the United Provinces. The Central Provinces, Sipirral, and Gandhi have suffered rain damage, but the weather has now cleared. In terms of spot goods, local manufacturers are asking for good prices, but export inquiries are rare. Export market prices are still 10% more expensive than American cotton. The following is a statistical appendix for the past week (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>|   | 1930 | 1931 |</p>
<p>|---------------------------------------------|------|------|</p>
<p>| Cumulative Receipts since September 1st | 96   | 48   |</p>
<p>| Weekend Inventory                    | 457  | 492  |</p>
<p>| Cumulative Exports since September 1st    | 265  | 130  |</p>
<p>| Shipped to Europe                    | 70   | 30   |</p>
<p>| Shipped to China                    | 52   | 52   |</p>
<p>| Shipped to Japan                    | 141  | 42   |</p>
<p>| Other Regions                        | 2    | 6    |</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot transactions were active last week. The futures market was firm and strong due to rumors of 7 million bales stockpiled in New Orleans and news of reduced cotton acreage next year. The market was quieter afterwards, but all hedging amounts were absorbed, so prices rose throughout the week. The market weakened slightly at the weekend due to sales in Alexandria. The Egyptian cotton market was generally very firm.</p>
<p>Food: River Rice Market Initially Falls, Then Stabilizes</p>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday, more than ten groups came, but the local sales were not active. The Su and Chang groups were the most numerous, creating a sense of stability. There was a slight increase in Baige Yaozhong Xiangmao, and the market increased slightly. New goods such as Tongli Beiwei were selling reasonably well. The opening price was lowered by one jiao, and new and old Yanglu Jian were selling evenly, with prices as before. Bianyinyuan goods flooded in, and prices were down by nearly one jiao. For a time, there was no Yongshu rice available on the market.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, there were more than thirty sources from the west, and transactions at the local market turned active. New Gaoding was soft, and the arrival of Qingjiao Yaozhong white rice and red rice was not much. Customer groups and local markets were slightly active, and prices did not rise or fall. Although there was not much Yangfu Jian arriving, the stomach was also sluggish. Glutinous rice was cheap, and sales were stagnant. The situation downstream was that Guijian and Jiaoba Jian goods were scarce and active, so the trend rose by two jiao.</p>
<h3>Northern Groups Continue to Handle Spot Ground Rice</h3>
<p>Yong Group Newly Orders Large Amount of Futures Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was very active. There were inquiries for spot goods from the Northern group, and the market rose by about two jiao. The Yong group ordered futures rice from foreign firms, and sentiment was also good. Futures rice for all months rose by 3-5 fen. The Tong Market opened with 1,500 bales of ground rice, priced at ten yuan and nine jiao, all of which were handled and transferred out by the Northern group. Yongxing threw 4,000 tons of February futures to the Yong group, priced at five taels, two qian, and five fen, which were directly delivered to Yong according to unloading. Also, 600 tons of March futures and 300 tons of April futures were sold in the market, priced at five taels, three qian, seven fen to five taels, three qian, and three fen, handled and brought in by the local market.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Market Changes from Stable to Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the flour market showed a trend of initially stabilizing and then weakening in each month. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat continued to be good, two or three jiao, people's hearts were naturally stable. However, with the Japanese troops in the Northeast not withdrawing, sales naturally stopped. Although Tianjin once had active spot sales, reaching 70,000-80,000 bags, it has recently declined again, averaging only around 30,000 bags, and the price is also flat and weak, only two yuan, nine jiao, two or three fen. Therefore, if the recent flour cannot be sold, and after the credit is tight again, it will naturally be difficult to stabilize. The distant futures may be able to stand firm afterwards because they dare not fix the price of wheat. As a result, this month's flour fell by one fen compared to the previous week's closing price, November fell by one fen, two li and a half, December fell by one fen, January fell by a small two li and a half, February rose by two li and a half, and March was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Plummets in the End</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, showed a trend of initially flat and then plummeting in each month. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat was still good, two or three jiao, both buying and selling were less active, and the market tended to be flat. However, at the afternoon opening, because the delivery date for this month was approaching again, buyers had to gradually close out positions. And because the factories' own foreign wheat was arriving continuously, they naturally had no time to consider buying standard wheat. In this overlap of foreign wheat, a state of oversupply naturally emerged again. In addition, with tight credit and many customer positions closing out, the recent market was forced to plummet again. As a result, this month plummeted by nine fen compared to the previous weekend, November fell by eight fen, December fell by nine fen, February fell by eight fen, and March fell by four fen.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Loose Price for Longkou Vermicelli</p>
<p>Since the arrival of Longkou vermicelli, the market trend has loosened. It is heard that it has opened at 23 taels and 6 qian, down several qian from the previous price. Recently, sales in various places have also been active, such as the Min, Yue, and Wen-Tai groups, which have all made purchases. Yesterday, the market price for genuine Longkou flour mills was 23 taels and a half, and the price for sub-brands was slightly lower, and the trend was stable.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Milan Italian Silk Inventory Reaches Over 10,000 Bales</p>
<p>In the Milan market, European sales of Italian silk are sluggish. New York silk sales are inactive. England and France are both facing economic uncertainty, with only a few spot transactions, and selling prices are extremely low. Factories are unwilling to sell at a loss, and the stock of silk is increasing daily. It is currently estimated that the inventory of Italian silk in the entire city of Milan has reached over 12,000 bales.</p>
<h3>White Factory Finished Goods Have Small Sales Prices and Are Difficult to Sell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local market for white factory finished goods remained stagnant. Although there were telegrams from New York to Shanghai at the end of last week, the prices offered were extremely low. The average price for B-grade, 83 points was only 823 taels, while the factory's cost was over 900 taels, making it difficult to sell at a loss. Negotiations continued yesterday, with Yuanli only offering 840 taels and wanting to deduct losses such as bag skin weight and wear and tear. The price per bale was still only 820 taels, making it difficult for the factory to sell. Yesterday, only Taihe brought in 10 bales of white dried silk, and Xinfu brought in 10 bales of small yellow factory finished silk, and the prices were still flat and weak.</p>
<h3>The Recession in the Tea Industry in Various Countries</h3>
<p>According to news from London, the recession in the tea industry in various countries this year is unprecedented in recent years. Most of the producing countries, including India, Java, China, and Japan, were affected by the black frost that fell between last autumn and winter, resulting in reduced harvests. According to general tea experts, the total amount of red and green tea produced in various countries this year is 40 million dan, a decrease of more than 6 million dan compared to before. Moreover, due to financial difficulties in various consuming countries, there has been no significant development in tea imports. In addition, due to the large accumulation of old tea, tea prices have become even lower. The overall situation of the world tea industry is not good.</p>
<p>Hardware: Tinplate Sales in Fujian Rise Again</p>
<p>Tinplate is essential for factory construction, but since the province was affected by bandit riots, sales have been greatly reduced. In recent days, that group has contacted us again to handle business, so the trend is optimistic, and standards have also risen significantly as a result. Currently, 90-pound tinplate sells for 13 taels, 100-pound for 15 taels (yellow goods), and American 90-pound sells for 15 taels, 100-pound for 16 taels and 5 qian, and 200-pound for 29 taels and 5 qian. It is heard that quite a number of transactions were opened yesterday.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Sheet Is Extremely Popular</h3>
<p>Since last year, when black iron sheets arrived in droves, various companies suffered great losses. Therefore, very few people ordered this year. Although the province of Eastern China has been ravaged by Japanese soldiers recently, and sales are not certain, the replenishments from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai are still good. Unfortunately, the existing stock is limited, so the market has a situation where supply cannot meet demand. The standard is extremely popular. For example, 18-gauge goods can already be estimated at 11 taels, continuing to rise by 2 qian and 5 fen compared to before. A comprehensive survey shows that there are only two or three thousand dan in stock, which is not enough for a week's purchase. It is feared that the market conditions will improve again in the future.</p>
<p>Coal: Baigu Stockpiled Coal Market Price Is Firm</p>
<p>The sales of Baigu stockpiled coal produced in Shandong have been quite smooth recently. Various silk factories and flour mills in the local area have purchased in large quantities. However, the supply is very short, and the market has a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Therefore, the opening price is exceptionally firm. Yesterday, lump coal sold for 14 taels and 5 qian, mixed coal for 14 taels, and coal dust for 13 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 16,700 Pieces of Indian Cotton Have Arrived in Shanghai. 15,000 Bales of American Cotton Were Imported Yesterday.</p>
<p>97 Pieces of Lake Silk Were Shipped to England and France.</p>
<p>6,000 Boxes of Tea Were Loaded for Spain.</p>
