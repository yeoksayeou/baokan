<h3 id="c16">甘地到倫敦 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>甘地已經到逹倫敦了。他去倫敦是專爲參加第二屆印度圓桌會議。由於一九三○年全印非武力反抗的革命高潮下所孵化出來的第一屆圓桌會議。它所給予印度的。除了麥克唐納所說的（凖備印度自治）及（在其憲法上進行中已逹到要點一事之承認）兩句話而外。可以說别無他物。領導非武力反抗運動的嗎哈嗎丨聖丨甘地此時正在獄中。圓桌會議閉會以後。他才被釋出獄。有人問他對於圓桌會議的意見。他的答話是。（不如回去紡紗。）可見他是很顯然的不滿意於第一屆圓桌會議了。</p>
<p>然而在他出獄不久。就有著名的（甘歐協定）出現。（甘歐協定）共有七條。除了赦免印度政治犯。及准許印度居住鹽區的貧民得自由製鹽而外。印度所得的。仍然是一無他物。協定消息傳到英京後。英人無不欣喜異常。（凡對於印度眞正繁榮關心之英印人士。均將歡迎此項協定。）（英印協定條欵。可築成英印關係眞正圓滿之基礎。）這許多都是英人躊躇滿志的笑聲。然而在這笑聲裏我們却隱若可以聽得那三萬印度人的悲泣。</p>
<p>目前的英國。是失業問題加重。財政危機加大。英國政府亦因此而發生遞嬗。在這種情况之下所舉行的第二屆圓桌會議。能否給予印人以一個滿意的結果。我們相信祇有傻子才存着這樣的奢望。Bernien曾說。（印度好比一個深潭。世界上大部分的金銀。從各處各道流入。却祇有一道流出。）這句極其傳神的話。充分地說明了英宗主國與其殖民地的印度在經濟上的深切關係。那末。如果要問在第二屆圓桌會議中英國是否肯讓印度獨立自由。毌寗問世界上是否有人肯自己閉寒流入金銀的孔道。</p>
<p>那末甘地到倫敦去做什麽呢。（可能的話。就在英帝國圈内進行。）（我想英人是實際自己受自由的人民。所以把自由給他人。只是百尺竿頭更進一步罷了）。甘地現在只是在努力實騐自己的理想。並忠實地遵照。着自己的話做啊。可是（在英帝國圈内進行。）也未見得便能一帆順風。本屆圓桌會議的最重要工作。是編製聨邦憲法。而其進行的前途。則還擺着。（一）印人左右傾勢力的抗衡。（二）印回二族難趨妥協。（三）印度與藩屬問題的三重難關。尤其第二項最爲棘手。第二項問題的癓结。即爲選與代表法規定的爭執。回人在甘歐協定以後的全印回族大會中曾主張且印度全體回人的名義。聲明對於圓桌會議不再合作。雖以領袖斡旋。没曾通過。但該會仍曾直率宣布以印回兩族分别投票爲保障回族政治地位的方法。甘地雖曾和他們一再誠意交涉。終至决裂。所以制憲工作。問題正多。决不能順利進行。從印回兩民族的爭執中。我們可以看得出印度的資產階級。不過是想從英帝國的手裏分取一部分統治權。並無多大奢望。然而我們相信。被稱爲嗎哈嗎的甘地。次不是爲分統權治而去倫敦。</p>
<p>今年五月間甘地和英國某新聞記者談話。曾表示（印度不需要英國文化（（屬領地位與印不適。）所爭者决不在文字。而在實際。我們且看甘地此行如何爭得（實際）。孫中山先生曾說。（不過對於歐洲人只用仁義去感化他們。要請在亞洲的歐洲人。都是和平的退回我們的權利。那就像與虎謀皮。一定是做到的）（見大亞細亞主義演講詞）因此。我們又十分爲甘地此行担心。</p>

<p>▲國民十四日維也納電奥國斯蒂里亞省泛繫黨徒自衛團之政變、以民心不附、與富道之嚴厲處置、業已完全平靖、主謀浦斐末博士逃亡國外、同謀者被捕一百人、即自衛團領袖史泰海姆堡親王亦在拘留之列、自昨日午夜政府軍隊進至該團最後負嵎之納特爾斐特、若　無抵抗降服、亂事遂完全平息、現各地官吏已盡復職、今晨各報對於政府靖亂之迅速與堅决、大爲滿意、京中已回復常狀、社會黨領袖亦命共和衛隊中之工人重返工作、按斯蒂利亞之小政變、發生於昨晨三四小時頃、武裝泛繫黨徒和平佔據儒登堡·白魯克·柯區斐特·及納特爾斐特等市立市政廳與各行政官署、若輩反對政府之减政折衷方案、認社會黨之贊成該案、足以表示中產階級之左趨、因欲藉武力以取得政權、該黨黨徒大半爲貴族與保守份子、戴史泰海姆堡博士爲魁首、擁護前内閣總理史丕爾而反對社會黨、</p>

<p>料係國際黨徒所爲</p>
<p>▲國民十三日匈京電布逹佩斯維也纳特别快車、昨夜在道巴基附近棧橋被炸、致車墜山谷、今已於車輛中覓獲屍首廿七具、血肉糢糊、慘不忍覩、幸該車十二節乘客僅有二十人、而爆炸遲數秒鐘、機車業已過橋、故僅中間四節墜於谷中、火藥線附近檢獲一紙條、上書（各人注意、今後吾人將每月炸車一列、吾人組織完密、各地均派有暗探、吾人之權力不久便可分曉、苟資本主義不予吾人工作、吾人將用此辦法自尋工作（字樣、警官閱此字條後、即下令嚴密偵查出事區域、發覺另一棧橋路軌、亦埋有炸彈、幸東方特别快車遲到二十分鐘、否則又將發生慘劇、</p>

<p>▲路透十三日西謨拉電上海傳出一種謡言、謂印度羅比合十八便士之法定比率、將有變更、印度政府人員指此爲不可輕信之傳言、並囑路透社聲明此說之絕對無稽、印度政府將用其所有力量以維持現有之法定比率、查此種謡言、殆因議會中反對派提出議案、要求政府考慮匯兌地位一事而起、昨日政府財政委員休斯特已說明印政府之地位、謂若政府恢復十六便士之比率、則須增加五千萬羅比之收入、始可應付其法定義務云、依據非官塲之估計、如恢復原有比率、則短少之數、當爲一萬二千萬羅比、故政府决不能變更現有比率、印政府在目前商業停滯之狀况中、確不易維持羅比匯率、但以現有發行高利率短期債劵之政策、加以積極减政之努力、與公用物如水電等取價之暫時略增、亦足以維持羅比定率、</p>

<p>▲復旦隊大顯威風昨日之戰、一望成績、即知形勢如何、遠不如理想中之劇烈與接近、大夏竟全非復旦對手、第一局復旦十一比六勝上半時、而以二十一比十三勝第一局、第二局大夏依然不振、復旦十一比五又先勝、結局二十一比十分、第三局大夏曾以五比四超出、一球後、勢形又非、十一比六、而以二十一比十二終局、結果三比○、</p>
<p>▲飛將軍名不虚傳復旦昨日表演、較前日大佳、聲勢百倍、無論合作壓殺、皆絲絲入扣、而飛將軍曹贊乃大顯神技、一擊之下、毫不留情、前日球之出界者、昨日皆在線内矣、大夏三局、好如居砲火之下矣、</p>
<p>▲陳寳球抱病登塲大夏遜色、原因有焉、主將陳寳球抱病參戰、頭上猶緊縛白巾一方、向之一擊定勝負之千鈞重壓、昨日乃不多見、綜計二三次而已、不得已第三局改任邊將、而中堅衛鼎彝之殺球、不得意者甚多、於是乎敗矣</p>

<p>在毛毛雨中、五十項運動開始比賽、場外觀者寥寥、場中之評判員較運動員爲多、故田徑場上、與前日比較、大有今昔之感、所幸到場之運動員、個個精神勃勃、無不欲一傾平生之技、</p>

<p>五項運動、爲上海市選手、特長之運動、去年全運會、在杭州開會時、五項第一第二、全爲上海市包辦、故昨日之五項比賽、預料必有佳良之成績、但自前日王季淮以跳遠狃傷脇筋之消息傳出後、一般熱心是道者、鮮不　　不樂而嘆五項比賽、必因之遜色、不意喜出望外、昨日下午一時左右、記者蒞塲時、王君季淮已先我而到塲矣、記者深恐有心理關係、見面後祗加鼓勵之辭對於足筋紐傷等、全不提及、比賽結果、大能令人滿意、居然以二八二一·三○五分之成績造國新紀錄、超過華北運動會陳盛魁之成績、多至二六八分有餘、昨日比賽并以一萬米關係、致次序顚倒、在跑二百米後、休息未及一刻鐘、即跑一千五百米、成績因之略遜否則總分當更可觀也、去年全國運動會五項冠軍、郝春德、以一千五百米及標槍等成績較　、致退居第二茲將各人全部之成績錄後、</p>

<p>時間一分三十六秒七</p>
<p>昨晚下午七時、全市男女游泳健將麕集於徐家滙交通大學游泳池、各顯其好身手、互相逐鹿、致使六七百作壁上觀、羣衆狂呼亂呌、掌聲雷動、而百米仰泳全國新紀錄、即於此緊張之空氣中、由温敬多創造、茲將各項比賽經過情略述如左、</p>
<h3 id="c120">（一）比賽概評 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲男五十米自由式第二組林江水泳姿勢頗佳、逹到終點時、名列第二、惜中途不自小心游過分道之外、致被取消資格、</p>
<p>▲女五十米自由式第一名龔希及、體格魁梧、頗有男子風態、其游泳之姿勢、十分優美、</p>
<p>▲男百米仰泳預賽中第一二兩組之第一名、均用雙臂向後、同時划水法、而兩組之第二名、則均用單臂、向後交換划、觀者無不稱怪、仰泳健將俞斌祺、因游時越過界線、致被取消比賽資格、否則俞君已獲得第二名、明日决賽、亦頗有望、</p>
<p>▲一千五百米預賽第一組第一第二及第三名前後相距各五十米、依次逹到終點、秩序井然非常有趣、第二組陳全玳已游畢、三十六來回、居第二位、惜怱然腹痛、因此不得不放棄其比賽資格、實在可惜、</p>
<p>▲二百米胸泳預賽第一組游興方濃之際、蘇祖卿發生抽筋於池中、時起時落、池旁其他健兒、見義勇爲、三五成羣、急躍池中、施救出險、所有觀衆、皆擊掌稱幸、</p>
<p>▲男子百米第二組競爭異常劇烈、第一名尹衍鈞與第二名陳顯南、逹到終點時、相距僅數寸、</p>
<p>▲女子百米自由式僅有龔希芨女士一名、臨時請陳氏三姊妹加入表演、陳寳璇女士年最長十三歲、游至二十五米之際、最先領導、旋被龔女士趕上、結果第二、陳寳璫女士較其姊略小兩歲亦能游畢全程、頗屬難能、最小者爲陳寳聨女士僅九齡、嬌子玲龍、活潑非凡、姿勢優美、日後定能成一名游泳健將、記者可以預卜</p>

<p>萬米長跑、以昨日决賽之情形論可稱人才濟濟、有三十一人起步、有二十餘跑到、前六名相差之距離頗近、一路競爭之劇烈、爲上海有萬米比賽以來、可謂空前紀錄、王正林自出發後、即追隨馬逢瑞、七八圈内、一若好汽車、拖了壞汽車、一圈一圈、狀甚發噱、自十圈後、王君究不如馬、漸漸落後、致可望而不可及、離馬終在二三十米中間、後面徐彦博陳行　董家爕陳盧舟亦各氣喘吳牛、緊緊相隨、在此情形之下、眞不知鹿死誰手、結果馬究是馬、并提起了此馬、無不仰瞻馬首、拜到蹄下、王正林徐彦博陳行偑奪鬥到底奪得二三四位置陳虚舟老矣、更探悉日前久病、精力有退、致名落孫山、其餘各子精神頗佳中途退出、不能跑完全程者而少、此誠值得紀念之一事、并在點名時缺席者亦復不多、由此可見本市市民對於長跑之興趣矣、惟統觀全體賽員、姿勢不佳者不少步子夫高、而俱有跳躍之姿勢者、爲長跑最大之病、以後切宜改良、茲錄萬米之結果如下、</p>

<p>昨日爲滬市收容災民辦事處、將各地來滬災民、集中於閘北柳營路第一收容收之第一日、茲紀詳情如下、</p>
<p>▲分批輸送昨晨該處各職員齊集辦事處後、即分别出發、由中國搬塲汽車公司撥汽車四輛、專供輸送之用、南北相距　遠、往返需時、上午行車十五次、始將潮州五邑山莊災民輸送完畢、下午專輸送永錫堂浙紹公所災民、如時間容許、瞿眞人廟災民亦將一併輸送、惟潮惠山莊災民、勢須於今日輸送矣、</p>
<p>▲所内設備昨日天雨無常、故該辦事處康定之整理計畫、未克實行、只有將災民按點人數、如確係一家人口有十二三口者、則居一室、大約每室以十人至十二三人駕度、察入口大小而定、每室長二十五尺、寛十尺、以二吋厚之木板舖成床舖、離地二尺有餘、上置擱板、下鋪煤屑、泥磚築道、外有走廊、沿廊置有板凳、當潮州五邑山莊災民、初遷時、雖早經向之說明、災民猶多疑慮、甚有號咷不欲上車者、又經職員曉勸、始隨之以行、及抵收容所、一覩所居之地、無不歡躍、甚有破涕爲災者、然收容所此時尙未以災民應用之衣物發給也、</p>
<p>▲打針種痘凡由汽車送到柳營路第一收容所之災民、先須由辦事處衛生組所派之技士、每人打過防疫針及種牛痘一次、可由辦事處人員分配住屋、領導入内、並即開飯、每餐爲一素菜一湯、甚爲清潔、而辦事人員所吃之菜品亦與災民一律、又悉待災民集中齊全後、即僱理髮匠至所、分批薙剃長髮、並使其沐浴、以保清潔云、</p>
<p>▲電勿再送市社會局昨接湖北民政廳寒電開、災民二萬、分批運滬、可否收容、盼電復社會局當以各省來滬災民已衆、給養浩繁、設備不易、已電復鄂民廳、勿以災民向滬輸送云、</p>

<p>國人收回後氣象一新</p>
<p>發行鉅大之紀念特刋</p>
<p>上海以商業政治歷史地理之關係、儼然爲國内新聞事業之中心、數年以來、報界頗多變遷、其間最值得注意者、尤莫若大陸報之入華人掌握、</p>
<p>上海有英文之朝報三、並駕齊驅、大陸報其一也、大陸報創刋於一九一一年、距今恰爲二十載、當時革命潮流、漰湃洶湧、而國際空氣、頗似欵慮、孫總理與伍廷芳先生唐紹儀先生等、乃醵資授美人密勒氏、囑以辦報、以正國際視聽、此大陸報之始也、其後世變靡常、孫總理等不暇顧此、遂淪爲美籍、主持者屢易其人、顧以夙在美國註册之故、人人知其爲美國人之機關報、迨去歲十月、始由中國報界中人集股承受之、自是而後、大陸報又爲上海方面唯一之英文中國報紙矣、</p>
<p>十月以來、大陸報進步頗著、良以經營之者旣屬行家、（主持筆政者爲報界久著聲望之董顯光君、曾手創天津庸報、）而取材之方針、復能適合於其性質與地位也、其顯而易見者、約有二端、（一）營業方面、銷數與廣告、俱見激增、銷數較前已增、一倍、廣告亦增三分之一、（二）編輯方面、除關於國際新聞與中外貿易以及文藝技術電影諸端、依舊注意、以保持其原有之外國讀者、並英文報之面目而外、凡關於中國政聞、社會問題、建設計劃、與華商之意見等種種方面、無不力救詳盡準確、（關於中國消息、且能較外報早一日披露、）一矯外報捕風捉影隔靴搔癢之弊、其言論之態度、雖實質上完全以中國之利害關係爲出發點、然以力避褊狹、力求誠摰之故、頗能表示主張公道之精神、此數者切合外僑之實際需要、因多數正當之外僑、在華無非經營工商、故求知者爲中國之眞相與眞意、初非樂聞不利中國之謡言與怪論也、因此之故、往日之大陸報、以其籍貫關係、最能吸收美僑爲讀者、而改組之後、則爲各國僑商以及其本國所普遍注意與信仰、此　十月來成功之主因也、</p>
<p>華人得此大陸報之後、凡關國家之對外宣傳者、當然自奉爲天職、而上海之中國商界、亦能漸次理解對外喉舌之必要、故對於大陸報亦能作相當之運用、且視爲增進中外貿易之媒介、平時甚能注意大陸報、遇必要時、輒利用大陸報之廣告與紀事、作避害趨利之計、並以推廣其營業、大陸報受惠於此等情况者甚厚、願努力所致、非得之徼倖也、聞大陸報茲方規劃猛進之方案、務期完成其對於中國朝野所負之對外使命、即關於政治外交經濟商業、乃至文化藝術各方面、作切實之貢獻、</p>
<p>本年八月二十九日、爲大陸報創刋二十週年紀念、爰於九月十五日發行特刋、有一百大頁之鉅、蔣主席·張副司令·外交部王部長·實業部孔部長·交通部王部長·鐵道部連部長·衛生部劉部長·上海市張市長·外交部情報處刁處長·中國銀行張公權先生·浙江實業銀行李馨蓀先生·中國報界名人史量才·張竹平·潘公弼·汪英賓·戈公振·汪伯奇·林振彬·諸先生、及其他中外名流、或錫以祝詞、或投以鉅著、琳瑯滿目、美不勝收、而蔣主席以大陸報與中華民國同時成立、已有二十年之歷史、於祝詞中、尤致其重視之意、至中外名人之論著、多關於中國二十年來之新建設、無一篇無價值、其名貴可不待言、聞特刋共印三萬份、將遍佈於全世界、此種紀念、實開滬上西文報紙之新紀錄、蓋大陸報同人對於此舉、籌備至數月之久、宜其有此成績也、</p>
<p>大陸報爲紀念二十週年、於發行特刋以外、並另訂優待定戶辦法、以期普及、普通定戶、全年照定價二十四元、八折實收、而於學生定戶、更見優待、全年照特價十八元、再可獲一九五折、此誠國人閱讀英文報紙之絕好機會、幸毌忽視之也、服務於大陸報之職員、佔國籍凡七、即中·英·美·法·葡·日·韓·是也、且不僅限於男性、而女性亦有多人、即此可見其網羅人才之廣、不爲國界所限、亦非他報所能及矣、（九月十四日）</p>

<p>浦文汀自錫來滬</p>
<p>在戚家作方城戲</p>
<p>三綁匪前來拜訪</p>
<p>晤面後强架之去</p>
<p>昨晚八時許、法租界福煦路四明里發生一離奇綁票案、匪徒竟胆敢登堂入室、公然將肉票架去、實開滬上綁票案中新紀錄、而由此更足證明綁匪之猖獗、茲將詳情錄次、</p>
<p>▲王姓婦人賃屋法租界福煦路迤西有里名曰成和邨、近因轉戶與四明銀行執業、乃重建新式大厦、遂更名爲四明里、在兩旬以前、有婦人自稱王氏、賃頂該里十九號石庫門住房一所、王氏除自居樓下、二樓即分租與一單獨婦人、而該婦亦適王姓、</p>
<p>▲陪客作方城戲前日（十二日）王宅忽來無錫親戚名浦文汀者、浦現年五十八歲、向在無錫福新麵粉廠供職、到滬後、即下榻於王宅、昨日午後、王氏與樓上王氏歸人並邀同素識之小姊妹兩人、特陪浦作方城游、以資消遣、詎至入晚八時許、突然發生變故、</p>
<p>▲三人訪浦先生浦與三女性竹戰方酣、王宅女傭范媽、正在厨下整頓晚膳之際、突聞有人用指彈擊後門聲、傭詢爲誰、門外應聲曰、訪浦先生、傭乃啓戶、祇見身御長服者三人、魚貫而入、而態度從容、有似匪類者流、傭乃命客稍待、引頸向樓上頻呼浦先生、</p>
<p>▲二人逼近扶梯當三人入門時、傭詢彼等訪浦何爲、一人答稱彼等同營麵粉業、因有交易、特來面洽、傭見爲浦之友、遂囑在樓下稍待、一面呼浦下樓、此時已有二人走近扶梯兩旁、其一即拽衣端坐於近後門之長橙上、專候財神命駕、</p>
<p>▲手槍同時出現浦聞呼喚聲、並未稍加猶豫、亟即起身、大踏步下樓、並連聲頻問、（啥人）、迨浦步下最低一級扶梯時、兩匪突出、堵住梯口、再待浦轉身熟視時、黑而且亮之手槍兩枝、已逼近左右腰際、若衛、士之圍護長官然、一擁而出後門、</p>
<p>▲挾上汽車而去同時滿座於橙上之匪、目擊肉票得手、乃搶先竄出後門、躍上汽車、路動引擎、霎時兩匪已挾浦登車、嗚嗚一聲、汽車已出弄口向東風馳電掣而去、此時范傭如夢初醒、上樓報告、三女性更聞耗駭極、再待奔至弄口、訴諸守弄華捕、奈已杳如黄鶴、</p>
<p>▲婦人答詞甚窘捕房亦同時據報、餘探往查、本報記者亦先後赶到、據二房東王氏云、伊夫名王君籟、詢其現執何業、而該氏面現難色、囁嚅良久、答曰他（指其夫）已數載未歸、前曾一度供職軍界、諸位、（指記者）隨便寫寫好了、態度侷促不寗、措詞異常恍惚、</p>
<p>▲路人傳說一般記者復私詢同室中人、據告樓上一婦人、實係浦之簉室、而所謂二房東王氏婦人者、對浦亦甚親暱、個中隱秘、實非局外人所能明瞭其萬一、至於匪等所用汽車、係直接候在十九號之後門距離弄口約數十碼之遥、且該里居戶自備及僱用汽車者甚多、故守弄華捕、亦未暇注意、實不料綁匪竟敢公然將汽車駛入該弄而入室架票也、祇據附近一二路人之稱、頃間確見一汽車急駛出弄、爲黑牌自備車、現二房東王氏、已急電至無錫與浦之長子浦永逹、迅即來滬主持云、</p>

<p>昨日下午二時、潮水來時、勢甚湧急、致黄浦江不能容積、泛濫岸上、一時外灘公園及沿黄浦灘路南四川路福州路一帶、因地勢較低、當積水約有六英寸之高、一時附近路過無知愚民、均以上海將爲第二漢口、故惶恐萬狀、該潮約歷一小時始退、</p>

<p>去年有一天下午我帶着餓肚到新愛倫影戲院看影戲，乘着休息的十分鐘，走到門口，下了一碗麵吃。這碗麵費了十四個銅版，連煑帶吃只用了五分鐘，可算是經濟極了。看看還有五分鐘便乘機問問麵攤營業的情形。攤販姓沈。整套器具值十八元，材料成本計二元，月納巡捕房照會捐二元，每月可賺三十元。我說你的進欵比鄕村敎師還要好一點。他說苦來些，每天深夜四點鐘回家，早上七點就要出來買材料準備一天賣的麵餃。不是這樣，一家人便不能活。我看沈君臉色黄瘦，確是辛苦太過的結果。十四個銅版一碗的麵，雖是平民的午餐，但是另一平民的康健換來的。今年想起此事，發生無限感慨，便寫了一首詩想送老沈，但老沈已是不知去向了。</p>
<p>（新愛倫門前麵一碗，化了一十四個小銅版。攤販名字呌老沈，自做夥計與老板。每月可賺三十元，敎師不如擺麵攤。那知他說（苦來些，一夜只睡三黠江鐘，若要多睡一刻兒，兒女凍餓誰做東？）將他從頭望到底；一株枯樹立秋風。麵兒代價我知了，不是紫銅是血紅！）</p>

<p>首都大水迄未退落。興中門外大街。爲下關入城之唯一要道。前由市工務局在積水之處。搭板架橋。以利通行。兩旁並用沙袋障堵橋　立有警士。手持紅錄旗幟。指揮車輛。頗見特别。不過首都車輛。爲數日增。公共汽車之外。若各機關之公用汽車。街頭營業之野雞汽車。以及馬車黄包車等。昔之進城可由挹江門者。今皆經過此道。常致擁擠不前。難於通往來。爲尤困難。坐車中者。往往能聞車夫呌囂爭論之聲也。</p>
<p>救濟水災。人具同情。京市一般災民。多就城垜高處。用蘆蓆搭蓋。聊資棲身。其餘如下關車站月台。亦有不少難民。坐臥其間。每日餬口。不過饅頭數個而已。自市民發起賑災以來。各方踴躍輸將。嘉惠災黎。得力不淺。現在各遊藝塲所。均有捐資助振之舉。世界國民等影戲院。特於每日上午十時。加映電影一次。所有門票收入。盡在下午。今茲增映。實首創也。下關街市積水。有若干小學校。盡爲水困。開學期屆。而學子遂觀望不前。但亦不能任其輟學。因各在學校門前。舖架木板。其形狀恍如船隻攏岸時所用之跳板也。學生家屬。對於子女。愛護備至。率遣傭朝夕伴送。聞有幾處小學校。即開課仍受水之影響。敎室不敷分配。補救辦法。各級學生。有規定上下午輪流上課之舉。每日可得半天之休息云。</p>

<p>— 明</p>
<p>此次法京巴黎。有跳舞競賽會之舉行。此事轟動全球。業已於七月二十二日上午伴爲法國少女。二人連日連夜。共舞七百五十二小時。約有三十一日餘。委爲長時期跳舞之新紀錄。共得獎金一百鎊。</p>
<p>當跳舞比賽會開幕時。加入競賽者。均爲青年男女。而平日善於舞蹈術者。此賽以時間之長短。爲優勝之標準。其初所有舞侣。均能日夜跳舞。一無中輟。然爲日較多。力弱者先後不支。自行離塲。放棄錦標。最後祇剩此一對優勝伴侣。至七月二十二日上午四時。亦因不支而仆地矣。</p>
<p>俄而少蘇。此女伴嚶然作微聲曰。（不能再舞矣。）然計算時日。已無至七百五十二小時。餘人已散走一空。且另有雙舞侣。在前一日。忽因女伴傷足而輟舞。否則爲彼等之勁敵。鹿死誰手。正未可預卜也。</p>
<p>當比賽舞蹈時。此一雙舞侣鞋子之消費。得未曾有。在此三十一日中。女伴共穿破鞋子二十雙。男者亦有八雙之多。比賽結果。二獎即爲上一日停止之舞侣。相差不過半日。亦幸與不幸也。</p>
<p>此次比賽大會。在巴黎舉行。結果頗爲美滿。因之發起諸人。擬在最近期内。更在倫敦舉行一次。獎金當有一，六○○鎊之多。至於比賽方法。每小時中。僅可停止十五分鐘。其餘時間。均須日夜連續跳舞以時間最長而並未中輟。得獲錦標云。</p>

<p>素商旣屆。炎威潛踪。入晚凉颶指袂。心神益覺疎爽。忽醉翁電話來。謂新攝聲片（歌塲春色）。將在光陸戲院作非正式之試映。邀余往觀。余欣然雇車往。至則已將開映。入座片刻。即聞樂聲鏘然。發自銀幕。則名音樂師亨利納純Henry　Natnan領導之音樂團表啓幕曲也。是片光線之柔和清晰。發音之準確清楚。確與最佳之舶來片無異。全劇以歌始。以歌終。殊耐人尋味。首塲所歌爲（青春之樂）。係黎錦暉作歌并製譜。其詞曰。（一）春光好。春色嬌。春意深深。春心悄悄。梨花面。太妖嬈。杏眼含情。桃顧帶笑。翠彎彎。柳眉長。紅艶。櫻桃小。春日融融。春雲渺渺。舞春風。細柳腰。鮮花初放。嫩蕋含苞。莫辜負新春來到。（二）春光好。春色嬌。春意深深。春心悄悄。開簾幕。列笙蕭。佳耦同來。良朋並到。愛綿綿。比目魚。情切切。雙棲烏。樂韻悠揚。歌聲美妙。舞翩翩。輕擁抱。情花初放。愛蕋含苞。莫辜負青春年少。（尾聲）新春色。好春光。趁青春。入歡塲。種下愛情的種子。愛永情長。開放歡喜的花。歡喜無量。結成幸福的果。幸福無疆。良朋對對。愛侣雙。莫辜負多情歌唱。末塲所歌爲（棟花風）。係高天棲作歌。裘芑香製譜。其詞曰。一、殘霞兒飛天。斜暉淡欲眠。那堪好景匆匆去。密意柔情兩渺綿。春去夢如烟。斷腸人立晚風前。二、粉蝶兒翩躚。落花紅可憐。柳絲不繫春光住。雨苦風酸又一年。雙燕話簾前。新愁舊恨一齊牽。</p>

<h3 id="c202">美國的電影業（二） <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>美國電影事業。在目前眞是不景氣得很。中下級社會。閙着麫包問題。正若没有解决的方法。向來染有電影癖的人。如今爲經濟力量所壓迫。那裡再有興致去看電影。據各大戲院的報告。近一年以來。每日觀客平均減少了三成以上。戲院以營業衰落而歇業的爲數不少。影片公司出品的銷路。也大受影響。我（洪氏自稱）在好萊塢時。除Fox,R.K.O.Paramount等三家大公司以外。有幾家减少出品。勉强維持。有好幾家已陷於停頓的狀態。</p>
<p>在過去影對發逹的時候。各影片公司拍攝一片。往往耗費數十萬以至百萬金而不惜。明星導演們俸給的優厚。眞是駭人聽聞。現在影業衰敗了。各公司都抱着緊縮政策。大裁演員。因此而失業者很多。要是拍攝一片。導演必須先製精密的預算。經公司核准之後。方始可以照辦。不像以前可以無限制的動用欵項了。也有公司與導演簽訂合同。收買其獨立製成之片。採用這包工制。無非爲節省開支。減輕成本的權宜辦法。</p>
<p>好萊塢有兩位大明星。最近都出了故事。一是導演劉别謙。一是女明星克蘭拉寳Cla　Bow他們都是爲了（愛情）而忿恨。消極·以至於犧牲。留别謙肯用功研究電影藝術。所以他導演的出品。寰宇風行。名震一時。他有一位經他一手提拔而成名編劇家的友人。竟和劉别謙夫人發生了暧昧的行爲。劉别謙受這重大的剌激。心境惡劣。而影響及其作品。他導演的新片（笑臉副官）。A　Smilling　Lientenant内容大不如前。於斯可見心理狀態與人生關係的重大了。克蘭拉寳是好萊塢大明星之一。近被某小報敲詐不遂而誹謗。遂至名譽地位兩受損失。小報主筆近亦被探入獄。監禁八年。伊雖勝訴。但恐從此有退隱的意思。</p>
<p>美國各大戲院。年來有許多新設備。例如（一）戲院門口另設戲台。演雜要戲。可使已買票而立待門口的現衆。不致感覺枯寂。（二）闢室寄存孩童。請女看護專司照料之責。有許多婦女門喜歡抱着小孩到戲院裡去有時因爲小孩啼哭嘻笑。而致紊亂秩序。引起觀客們的反對。他們這一種設備。好像臨時設立的幼稚園一般。於婦女們及觀衆。都有利便。那裏面寄存小孩的方法。和菜館跳舞場寄存衣帽一樣。也領取號數。領出時只要把號數交給看護。對準號數。小孩便領出來了。我想這種設備。海上各大戲院。大可仿行。所費有限。而收效甚大。何樂而不爲呢。</p>

<p>李先生的情緒，眞和奔流一般。起初，他祇想，假使有陳夫人這樣一個人，陪着看電影，上跳舞場，生活上可以腴潤得不少。自己的妻子，遠不如陳夫人的漂亮而大方，身畔有陳夫人這麽一個女子一起跑，好似一件很榮譽的事；他這個目的逹到了，於是他又計劃怎樣進一步向陳夫人表示。有一次，同坐在看電影，他把身子向伊靠得近些，暗暗地在窺察伊是否拒絕，或者往反方向坐離過去？但是伊好似没有覺得的樣子，依舊不動。他心裏有些跳動，差不多自己可以聽得出心房的聲音了，他偷偷地用着全力在黑暗而有些微的光亮裏，注視伊的睫毛，注視伊的神色，都覺得美麗而和善。伊偶然微微咳了一聲嗽，他便很温柔而低低的問伊：（有些冷吧）？說着順勢伸手去執着伊的手。他在以前當着陳先生的面，也很大方丨丨或者是很容氣的握過伊的手，現在這握手的姿勢，本來没有什麽特殊，但是心理上的成分完全不同，熱烈的情緒，好似電氣一般地通到了指尖，和伊温軟的手掌接觸、彷彿會發生火星一般。</p>
<p>伊很迅速地帶了淺笑側過頭來向着他，（哦）？這一聲似乎故作不懂，又似乎表示接受這電氣的通逹，很媚憨地，很温柔地，在引起丨丨也許是誘引，使他有發第二句話的機會。</p>
<p>（你在咳嗽，受凉吧？）他見伊並不拒絕，便把伊的手再握得緊些。</p>
<p>（不。你的手凉着呢。）</p>
<p>他假意地放鬆伊的手，想縮回了自己的手。但是伊反握緊了他的不放。</p>
<p>（把你的手也染凉了。）</p>
<p>（不，我給你温着。）伊素性把那一隻手，也覆在他的手背上了。他完全明瞭伊的情緒，也正在向對方射擊，正和海洋中兩方的輪船，各向對方開近，多拉着回聲相呼應，多發着無線電的信號相對啓，於是他又計劃作再進一步的表示。</p>

<p>▲孟買上週因假期多日、兼因等待美棉政府報告、營業清淡、報告發表後、市價雖跌、然因紐約及利物浦方面、對於美棉出口之財政計劃、均利於多頭、市勢頗穩、出口商買進甚微、除投機購買及補空外、買力平常、美棉縱或上漲、孟買未必追隨、現貨方面、奥姆辣及平果爾大受日本出口商及本地廠商之歡迎、歐洲出口商依然冷淡、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>第二天、先生又在上課了、繼續講那篇白話文、偶然在句子裏發見一個樂字、他毫不經意的念了兩句論語、（仁者樂山、知者樂水、……）看見（勞工神聖）一句話、又念了兩句孟子、（天之將降大任於是人也、必先苦其心志、勞其筋骨、……）</p>

<p>（先生、帝國主義在三民主義上、不是這樣講、）</p>
<p>先生笑了一笑、毫不遲疑的說、</p>
<p>（是的、帝國主義在黨義上、或者有别的解說、但我講的是國文、你要明白這一點）</p>

<p>Red Bandits Unable to Recover</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek has set a one-month deadline to suppress scattered bandits in southern Jiangxi. He himself will leave Nanjing before the 20th. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news reports that the bandit forces of Huang, consisting of the Third Army; Lin, the Fourth Army; Xu, the Fifth Army; Luo, the Twelfth Army; Yang, the Thirty-second Army; and Yang, the Thirty-fifth Army, totaling approximately 70,000 to 80,000 men with 40,000 to 50,000 rifles, suffered casualties of two-thirds in the battle of Gaoxingxu. Having exhausted their ammunition, they are unable to recover. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek is scheduled to arrive in Jiangxi around the 15th to complete the mission of suppressing the Red bandits. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The staff office of the Ninth Division reported that the division concentrated in Taihe and departed from Xingguo on the 6th. In the evening, the division was near Lantian, when over 3,000 bandits attacked. Our troops retaliated, and the bandits failed. As it was late at night, they were not pursued. On the 7th, they continued to advance towards Goucun and encountered the Third, Fifth, and Eighth Armies of the bandits, numbering over 30,000, at Laoyingpan. The Twenty-sixth Brigade rushed to reinforce, and the bandits retreated slightly. Fierce fighting then took place between Laoyingpan and Huangshixu. The bandits initially used group tactics to launch fierce attacks on our lines but were repelled. On the 9th, at dawn, the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Brigades of the division seized over ten mountain peaks in succession, and the bandits collapsed and retreated. The number of bandit deaths was countless. Over 600 bandit officers and soldiers were captured, who confessed that Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and Peng Dehuai were all at the front line supervising the battle. Having suffered this defeat, their elite troops have been wiped out. The division, together with allied forces, will continue to encircle and suppress them, and the suppression is not far off. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The bandits in Donggu, Futian, Xiaopu, and Huangpi number no more than 4,000 to 5,000. They have now gathered in the Longgang Mountains and are being tightly surrounded by the divisions of Luo Lin, Li Yunheng, Gong Bingfan, etc. Li Yunheng's troops defeated a portion of the bandits in Daijiaxu on the 11th.

<p>(Nanjing) On the 12th, the Executive Yuan sent a telegram to He Jian inquiring about certain important matters.

<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news reports that although the Japanese side has not directly negotiated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Nakamura Incident, they have proposed principles such as preferential treatment for the deceased and punishment of the murderers to the chief officials of the three northeastern provinces, without demanding the stationing of troops or commercial leases. It is reported that Doihara Kenji, the head of the Kwantung Army's special affairs agency, has returned to Tokyo from Fengtian to report the truth about the Nakamura Incident, hoping that his government will only discuss the subsequent issues of the incident and will not advocate expanding the scope of various issues to avoid a reaction from China. Based on this, the Nakamura Incident, which was previously rumored to have seriously affected Sino-Japanese relations, may be resolved appropriately. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Ji and Wu Tiecheng believe that the Japanese side is attempting to argue strongly and expand the scope of the Nakamura Incident, making the situation quite serious.

<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi telegraphed Deputy Zhang Xueliang and the Northeast Political Committee, stating that this year's flood is an unprecedented disaster, with widespread famine, which causes concern both domestically and internationally. Fortunately, the autumn harvest in several northeastern provinces is relatively abundant and can be used to provide relief. The Ministry of Finance previously telegraphed the governments of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces to investigate the amount of grain that can be exported outside the province for purchase and transportation for disaster relief. Now that they are showing concern early on, it is especially appreciated. However, the exact amount of grain in the northeastern provinces, how to transport it to the disaster areas, and how to facilitate the process should be detailed and reported quickly to the governments of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces for overall planning and relief. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry believes that there is a shortage of grain in the south due to the floods, while there is an abundant harvest and a surplus of grain in Jilin and Heilongjiang. Therefore, it has decided to convene representatives from the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, and relevant organizations on the 14th to discuss the freight rates of the Chinese Eastern Railway and South Manchuria Railway, as well as the national railway shipping methods, and to adopt concrete measures for procurement, distribution, taxes, etc. After a final review, it will formally proceed.

<h3 id="e16">Gandhi Arrives in London <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Gandhi has arrived in London. He is going to London specifically to attend the Second Indian Round Table Conference. The First Round Table Conference, which emerged from the high tide of the all-India non-violent resistance revolution in 1930, gave India nothing except two sentences from MacDonald: "(preparing for Indian autonomy)" and "(recognition that its constitution has reached the point of key elements under development)." Mahatma Gandhi, who led the non-violent resistance movement, was in prison at this time. He was only released from prison after the Round Table Conference closed. Someone asked him for his opinion on the Round Table Conference. His reply was, "(It's better to go back to spinning yarn.)" This shows that he was obviously dissatisfied with the First Round Table Conference.</p>
<p>However, shortly after his release, the famous "(Gandhi-Irwin Pact)" appeared. The "(Gandhi-Irwin Pact)" has a total of seven articles. Apart from pardoning Indian political prisoners and allowing poor people living in Indian salt areas to freely produce salt, India still gained nothing. After the news of the pact spread to London, the British were extremely happy. "(All British and Indian people who are concerned about the true prosperity of India will welcome this agreement.)" "(The terms of the British-Indian agreement can form the basis for a truly satisfactory British-Indian relationship.)" These are many of the British's smug laughs. However, in this laughter, we can faintly hear the weeping of the 30,000 Indians.</p>
<p>The current Britain is facing a worsening unemployment problem and an increasing financial crisis. The British government has also undergone a change due to this. We believe that only fools would have such extravagant hopes about whether the Second Round Table Conference, held under these circumstances, can give the Indians a satisfactory result. Bernien once said, "(India is like a deep pool. Most of the world's gold and silver flow in from all directions, but only one flows out.)" This extremely vivid sentence fully illustrates the deep economic relationship between the British suzerain state and its colony, India. So, if we want to ask whether Britain will be willing to let India be independent and free at the Second Round Table Conference, wouldn't that be like asking whether anyone in the world would be willing to close the channel through which gold and silver flow in?</p>
<p>So, what is Gandhi doing in London? "(If possible, proceed within the British Empire.)" "(I think the British are practically a people who enjoy freedom themselves, so giving freedom to others is just a further step.)" Gandhi is now just working hard to implement his ideals and faithfully following and doing what he says. However, "(proceeding within the British Empire)" is not guaranteed to go smoothly. The most important work of this Round Table Conference is to prepare a federal constitution, and its future progress is still facing the triple difficulties of (1) the resistance between the left and right-leaning forces in India, (2) the difficulty of compromise between the Indian and Muslim communities, and (3) the issue of India and the princely states. The second issue is particularly thorny. The crux of the second issue is the dispute over the election and the regulations governing representation. After the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, the Muslims, at the All-India Muslim Conference, once claimed, in the name of all Indian Muslims, that they would no longer cooperate with the Round Table Conference. Although leaders tried to mediate, it did not pass. However, the conference still frankly announced that separate voting between the Indian and Muslim communities was the way to protect the political status of the Muslim community. Although Gandhi had repeatedly and sincerely negotiated with them, it ended in a rupture. Therefore, the constitutional work has many problems and cannot proceed smoothly. From the dispute between the Indian and Muslim communities, we can see that the Indian bourgeoisie is only trying to seize a portion of the ruling power from the hands of the British Empire and does not have much extravagant hope. However, we believe that Gandhi, who is known as Mahatma, is not going to London to divide the ruling power.</p>
<p>In May of this year, Gandhi said in a conversation with a British journalist, "(India does not need British culture. The status of a dependent territory is not suitable for India. What we are fighting for is not in words, but in reality." Let us see how Gandhi will win "(reality)" on this trip. Sun Yat-sen once said, "(However, it is no use just using benevolence and righteousness to influence the Europeans. To ask the Europeans in Asia to peacefully return our rights is like seeking skin from a tiger. It must be impossible.)" (See the speech on Pan-Asianism). Therefore, we are very worried about Gandhi's trip.</p>

<p>Reports on the Nakamura Incident</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Major Shibayama, the military advisor to Zhang Xueliang, who was specially ordered to return to Japan due to the Captain Nakamura Incident, arrived in Tokyo this morning. After the General Staff Headquarters and the Ministry of the Army listened to Major Shibayama's report, they further verified the second phase of measures regarding the Nakamura Incident and communicated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Den-tsu News Agency Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Major Shibayama, the military advisor to Zhang Xueliang, arrived in Tokyo this morning and went to the General Staff Headquarters to convey Zhang Xueliang's words to Heavyweight Fuji, head of the China section, stating that China is awaiting the second investigation and the return of Pan Yimou to resolve the Nakamura Incident. He added his own opinion, saying that although Zhang Xueliang says this on the surface, his inner thoughts are difficult to fathom. The anti-Japanese and contemptuous attitude of the entire Chinese intelligentsia is quite deep. The Northeast authorities also seem to be perfunctory. This incident will not be easy to resolve. Even if the Chinese side admits the facts of the killing, the final negotiations are still not optimistic. He also submitted other reports and will meet with Minister of the Army Minami this afternoon to give the same report. (Den-tsu News Agency Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Colonel Doihara arrived in Tokyo, reported, and presented his opinions. He was given important instructions by the military authorities.

On the way, he will meet with Lieutenant General Honjo, the commander of the Kwantung Army, in Lushun to convey the instructions. The content of the instructions is extremely secret. (Den-tsu News Agency Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Colonel Doihara expressed his opinions on China at the research meeting at 10:30 a.m. on the 14th, saying that Japan should examine the Manchurian and Mongolian issues based on its own views. In order to protect East Asian peace, it should secure its vested rights in Manchuria and Mongolia at this time. The expansion of communist forces in central China is related to Russia's five-year plan. The expansion of the Chinese Communist Party will become the root of disaster in East Asia in the future.

<p>▲Reuters, London, 14th—Gandhi attended the meeting of the Federal Structure Committee of the Indian Round Table Conference for the first time today. General attention was focused on him. The committee had been suspended for seven months and reconvened a week ago, chaired by Lord Sankey, the Lord Chancellor. Representatives from all sides of Britain and India participated. Because Gandhi was present today, many people stood outside St. James's Palace to wait for Gandhi's arrival to catch a glimpse of his style. Shortly after, Gandhi arrived by car with Mrs. Naidu, the Indian poet and speaker. He was wrapped in a shawl and carried a bottle of goat's milk, which was his only food until night. Gandhi sat to the left of Lord Sankey. Today was his weekly day of silence, so he did not speak a word, only expressing his will in images to his close comrades, Malaviya, Sapru, and Jayakar. The newly appointed Secretary of State for India, Hoare, sat to the right of Lord Sankey.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Vienna, 13th—The Pan-German Party rebellion led by Dr. Pfrimer is currently rampant in the eastern part of the nine provinces of Styria. The rebels have achieved temporary victories in Styria, in the southeastern province. They also seized key cities with machine guns at Bruck, an important intersection on the main railway line to Vienna. However, the authorities immediately dispatched troops and police to suppress them, and they soon regained the occupied areas and restored order. The Pan-German Party also besieged military camps in Kotzdorf in Upper Austria, but the army came to their aid from other places, defeated the party members, and arrested two party leaders. The authorities have transferred three regiments of troops to Bruck, Middenburg, and the Mürz Valley because there are more rebels in those three places. Dr. Pfrimer has issued a proclamation stating that he wants</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>to establish a Pan-Germanic state. The Social Democratic Party has instructed its members in Styria to prepare everything but told them not to start a conflict with the Pan-German Party. The Pan-German Party headquarters in Vienna stated that it had not been involved in the rebellion. The situation in other Austrian provinces remains very calm. The Austrian Cabinet has declared its determination to use the full force of the state to restore peace and order in the shortest possible time and to severely punish those who incite unrest.</p>
<p>▲National, Vienna, 14th—The coup of the self-defense force of the Pan-German Party in Styria, Austria, has been completely quelled due to the lack of popular support and the strict handling of the rich. The mastermind, Dr. Pfrimer, fled abroad, and one hundred accomplices were arrested, including Prince Starhemberg, the leader of the self-defense force, who is also in custody. Since noon yesterday, government troops have advanced to Natterfeld, the last stronghold of the group, and surrendered without resistance. The rebellion has been completely quelled. Local officials have all been reinstated. This morning, newspapers are very satisfied with the government's swift and resolute suppression of the rebellion. The capital has returned to normal. The leader of the Social Democratic Party has also ordered the workers in the Republican Guard to return to work. The small coup in Styria occurred at around three or four o'clock yesterday morning. Armed Pan-German Party members peacefully occupied the city halls and administrative offices in Judenburg, Bruck, Köflach, and Natterfeld. These people opposed the government's austerity compromise plan, believing that the Social Democratic Party's support for the plan was sufficient to indicate the leftward trend of the middle class. Therefore, they wanted to seize power by force. Most of the party members are nobles and conservatives, led by Dr. Starhemberg, who support former Prime Minister Schober and oppose the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 14th—Recent news from Vienna is that the rebellion has been effectively contained. This news is welcomed throughout Europe, not only for Austria, which has suffered difficulties in recent years, but also for the sake of peace in Europe. If the Austrian Pan-German movement were to succeed, it would have serious implications elsewhere, especially in Germany. Dr. Pfrimer, the leader of the Austrian Pan-German Party, is a lawyer from Styria and has very close ties with Hitler, the leader of the radical faction in Germany. Both aim to merge Germany and Austria. The failure of the recent German-Austrian customs union plan naturally contributed to the outbreak of this rebellion. However, economic difficulties have also led the Austrian government to seek help from the League of Nations, which is also one of the reasons for the rebellion. Recently, there have been alarming rumors in Vienna that France is demanding impossible political guarantees as a condition for lending to Austria, but these rumors have been denied by responsible parties in Paris.</p>

<p>A Note Was Found at the Scene</p>
<p>Believed to Be the Work of International Radicals</p>
<p>▲National, Budapest, 13th—The Vienna-Budapest special train was bombed last night near a bridge in Dobogyi, causing the train to fall into a valley. Twenty-seven bodies have now been found in the wreckage, covered in blood and gore. Fortunately, there were only twenty passengers in the twelve carriages, and if the explosion had been a few seconds later, the locomotive would have already crossed the bridge, so only the four middle carriages fell into the valley. A note was found near the fuse, which read: "Attention all, from now on we will bomb a train every month. Our organization is complete, and spies are stationed everywhere. Our power will soon be revealed. If capitalism does not give us work, we will use this method to find work." After reading this note, police officers immediately ordered a strict investigation of the area where the incident occurred and discovered that another bridge track was also buried with explosives. Fortunately, the Orient Express was twenty minutes late, otherwise another tragedy would have occurred.</p>
<p>▲National, Budapest, 14th—A solid lead has not yet been found in the train bombing case. Only parts made in England, Poland, France, Germany, and other countries were found in the destroyed detonator, indicating that the case was the work of international radicals. Berlin police have also sent a commissioner to the scene to assist in the investigation, as it is believed that the case was committed by the same group that bombed the Berlin-Basel Express a month ago.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 14th—According to reliable sources, the Afghan government has contacted Japan to provide railway engineers to help Afghanistan build 1,000 miles of railway. This proposal was informally conveyed through the Japanese ambassador to Persia, as Japan does not have diplomatic representation in Afghanistan. Russia and Persia have both employed Japanese railway engineers, and it is said that the results have been quite good, so Afghanistan has made this proposal. It is said that the Ministry of Railways is currently considering it. It is also said that Afghanistan intends to ask Japan to invest 50 million yuan in the railway business.</p>

<p>▲National, Geneva, 13th—The Turkish delegation attending the European League Committee returned to Ankara today. The chief representative, Foreign Minister Rusdi, confirmed to visitors that Turkey intends to join the League of Nations. Although this matter has been discussed informally several times, the official would not directly say whether there has been a concrete proposal. However, according to other sources, this negotiation has not made substantial progress. Turkey may not be able to join the League of Nations for several years. It is said that the Turkish government requires a permanent council seat on the council and participation in various committees, as well as the inclusion of Turkish members in the League of Nations Secretariat.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Rumors of Changes in the Rupee Exchange Rate Are Untrue <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Reuters Dispels the Rumors</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Simla, 13th—A rumor has spread in Shanghai that the statutory exchange rate of the Indian Rupee at 18 pence will change. Indian government officials point to this as an incredible rumor and instructed Reuters to state that this statement is absolutely unfounded. The Indian government will use all its power to maintain the existing statutory exchange rate. The rumor was probably caused by the opposition in Parliament submitting a motion asking the government to consider the exchange rate status. Yesterday, Finance Committee Member Schuster of the government explained the position of the Indian government, saying that if the government restores the 16-pence exchange rate, it must increase its income by 50 million Rupees to meet its legal obligations. According to non-official estimates, if the original exchange rate is restored, the shortfall will be 120 million Rupees, so the government cannot change the current exchange rate. It is indeed not easy for the Indian government to maintain the Rupee exchange rate in the current state of commercial stagnation, but the current policy of issuing high-interest short-term bonds, coupled with active austerity efforts and a temporary slight increase in the price of public utilities such as water and electricity, is sufficient to maintain the fixed Rupee rate.</p>

<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Telegram to Shenbao Newspaper—The Su province levee caused disaster due to the dereliction of duty of river affairs personnel and ignorance of the importance of their work, resulting in a major mistake. This is obvious to everyone. However, it is heard that the authorities consistently attribute it to heaven's will and do not blame human affairs. Heaven or man? What is right and wrong? Society has its own public opinion. What is incomprehensible is that there were originally earthen oxen on the top of the levee, which were essential for preventing danger, and they have been increased every year. Why did they only know about the road and not about the water, causing them to be destroyed? As a result, when danger occurred, there was no soil to take. In the tenth year of the Republic, the water level was as high as two meters and overflowed in more than ten places. This time, the water level was only 1.9 meters. Why was it allowed to overflow and become a breach, and could it not be blocked in time? After the flood occurred, why did they only know to open the dams and not to repair the levees? When representatives from the lower river counties went to Gaoyou to protect the dams, they knew that the levee body was worrying, and they were willing to provide labor and materials themselves and could assist with funding, requesting cooperation between officials and the people. Why was it rejected? The Shuangjin Gate, the only outlet for the Yi River to the sea, why has it not been fully opened to this day? When the dam was not opened, the provincial government decided to add three feet to the levee. At that time, the southeast wind blew for more than ten days, which was the perfect time to learn from mistakes and make amends. However, the representatives of the counties witnessed that the project was sloppy and the materials were insufficient, and they were deeply afraid. They repeatedly asked to replenish the work and materials. Why was it ignored? If it is said that the 200,000 yuan of levee addition expenses already decided by the provincial government have not been issued, why can't a guarantee be obtained from the hundreds of thousands of yuan that the people of each county used to pay for the Governance and Transportation Mu tax every year? These are all grievances of the people who died today buried at the bottom of the sea and cannot rest in peace, and the pain of those who have not died and have suffered the pain of bankruptcy, wife and children separated, and are swallowing their voices and weeping, and have nowhere to appeal. As for other absurd things, which have been recorded in newspapers, it is not difficult to verify them one by one. The previous decision of the provincial government only ordered the dismissal of the head of the Water Conservancy Bureau and allowed him to remain in office. Regarding our association's request to order the river affairs personnel responsible for repairing the damaged areas, no answer has been given to this day. And the Water Conservancy Bureau lightly dismissed the Gaobao Duan director. Nothing else was discussed. Is this the end of the matter, or is there still a future? It is not known. Therefore, we implore all parties to act in good conscience, uphold justice, redress the grievances of the dead, vent the anger of the living, and give a warning to successors, then the clear blue sky will have some color. Whether it is right or not, we await clear instructions. Respectfully, the Yancheng Taidong Xing Flood Relief Committee, stationed in Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Taiyuan Telegram to All Newspapers and Magazines—It has been reported many times that in the summer and autumn of this year, in various cities and provinces south of the Yellow River and along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, there have been torrential rains, causing floods. The number of men and women who have died or been injured is countless. Fields and houses have been flooded, leaving people without homes. The dead cannot be brought back to life, and those who are alive are waiting to die. Horrified and sad reports are heard. If we do not offer help, what will relieve the urgent need? Therefore, on September 8, the Shanxi Province Flood Relief Fundraising Committee was established in this government to do our best to alleviate the disaster. While it was in progress, we received a telegram from the deputy commander, informing us that if provincial and district fundraising agencies have been established, they should be renamed branches, etc. Immediately, we changed the name to the Shanxi Branch of the Provincial Flood Relief Fundraising Association and actively handled it in accordance with the regulations. Respectfully, we send this telegram for your information. Shanxi Provincial Government, with seal.</p>

<p>Japanese Consul Goes to Liaoning to Seek Instructions, Talks Again After Returning</p>
<p>The Nakamura Captain Incident is Quite Serious</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Zhong Yu, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Jilin, due to involvement in the Wanbaoshan case, went to Jilin again on August 24th to continue negotiations with Japanese Consul Ishisa Shotaro stationed in Jilin. This morning at 7:55, he returned to Harbin from Liaoning. Various heads of familiar institutions all went to the station to welcome him. In the afternoon, Mr. Zhong went to the Municipal Preparatory Office to attend the flood relief meeting convened by the office. After 5 o'clock, he, together with Section Chief Liu Xingpei, inspected the Daxin Street road under construction. The reporter visited Mr. Zhong at the Municipal Preparatory Office at 4:30 pm and recorded his conversation as follows:</p>
<p>This time, I returned from Liaoning because Chairman Zhang (Zuoxiang)'s father passed away. I made a special trip to Jinzhou to offer condolences. There were three further talks on the Wanbaoshan case. In a nutshell, there were no results. The Japanese Consul does not allow Koreans residing in Wanbaoshan to leave the country. His attitude during the negotiations was firm, completely in line with the intention of his government's reply to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he also mentioned the Twenty-One Demands. He also insisted that the contract for Korean rice cultivation was valid. I argued with him based on reason and told him that the Twenty-One Demands were a thing of the past, and both sides should not raise this issue again, lest it increase unpleasant feelings in the international community. The rice cultivation contract in Wanbaoshan is also no longer a problem. Now, talking about the case itself, it is not appropriate for Koreans to stay in our inland areas any longer. The arguments in the three negotiations were always about this. Recently, as the negotiations were deadlocked, Ishisa said that he would go to Liaoning in the near future to consult with Consul General Lin, and after returning, he would schedule another round of negotiations. I also felt that the Japanese side's three replies were not detailed enough, so I telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions to refer to during the negotiations. At present, the negotiations are at a standstill, so I took the opportunity to return to this port to prepare to go to Jilin for negotiations around the Mid-Autumn Festival. At this point in the conversation, Mr. Zhong asked about any new news regarding the disappearance of Japanese Captain Nakamura, and said that the situation of this case is serious. Whether Nakamura is a real person and whether the situation is as serious as the Japanese side claims has yet to be proven. This case is now under negotiation in Liaoning, and the details are not well known. However, in the 18th year [of the Republic], the Harbin Negotiation Office once sent a note to the Japanese Consulate stating that the Solun Mountains are not comparable to the inland areas of the three eastern provinces, and the area is unstable, prohibiting foreigners from traveling there. The original case is on file, and we can now use it as a diplomatic basis. (9th)</p>

<p>Chiang Kai-shek Speaks on the Nature of the Pacific International Association</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Reports on the Severity of the Flood and Relief Measures</p>
<p>▲At 9:00 am on the 14th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 129th weekly memorial service for the late leader Sun Yat-sen. Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Ding Weifen, Zhang Qun, Chu Minyi, Wang Bailing, Fang Juehui, Wu Jingheng, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Zhaoying, and Chen Lifu, as well as staff and guests, totaling about 600 people, attended. After leading the ceremony by Chairman Ding Weifen, Committee Member Chiang Kai-shek reported on the nature of the Pacific International Association. The speech is as follows: (The Pacific International Association, at the invitation of the National Government, will hold a meeting in Hangzhou. Some comrades in our party do not understand the truth and advocate opposition. If we are to talk about public diplomacy, this meeting will have a significant impact on our country's public diplomacy. Its relationship with the beliefs of the Party Headquarters and the government is even deeper, so I will explain its general nature. Before expressing support or opposition to anything, we must first understand its content and nature. If we have no adequate understanding or clear knowledge of something, and then suddenly express support or opposition, we will either blindly follow or act recklessly. Blindly following should be deeply warned against, and reckless action is even more undesirable. The Pacific International Association is an organization of representatives elected automatically by the people of various countries. It is not an agency of various governments. Its purpose is to gather individuals in their capacity as citizens to study various conflicting international issues, and then propose appropriate methods to promote mutual understanding and connect the feelings between the people of various countries. It is not a tool for one country to invade another. We should not only not oppose such a group, but also fully support and encourage it to promote the success of our country's public diplomacy and national movement. The oppression and various unequal treatments that our country has suffered internationally are not fully understood by the people of various countries. We must seize every opportunity to fully publicize and make the people of various countries aware of China's situation in order to arouse their sympathy. The Pacific International Association is organized by outstanding members of the people of various countries. We can take this good opportunity to publicize the aggressive actions of various governments against our country, to awaken their people's consciousness, and to correct the behavior of their governments. The meeting was held in Kyoto, Japan, the year before last. The representatives of our country who attended the meeting discussed Japan's aggressive behavior against China at the meeting, which aroused a lot of sympathy from the people of various countries. This is clear evidence. Therefore, we should welcome the meeting in our country. There is no reason to oppose it. Now, a small number of party members do not understand the nature of the association, nor do they know the good opportunity for public diplomacy, and they engage in propaganda, and only blindly oppose it, or even be hinted and incited by reactionaries, as if the meeting in China will be used by imperialists. I don't know why their knowledge is so naive. No wonder others despise our party members for their lack of sophistication. The late leader Sun Yat-sen once said that the Chinese people's concepts and attitudes towards foreigners are often plagued by generalization without analysis. Before the Boxer Rebellion, foreigners were generally despised. After the Boxer Rebellion, they were generally feared. In recent years, because our party has called for the abolition of unequal treaties and resistance to imperialist aggression to arouse the people, naive people regard all foreigners as imperialists. This situation is enough to show the naivete of our country's people's knowledge. Although the governments of various countries harbor aggressive ambitions towards China, the people of various countries mostly express sympathy for China and even oppose the aggression and oppression of their own governments. We should regard foreigners who are intent on aggression as imperialists and resist them, but foreigners who have no intention of aggression and can sympathize with our country are all friends of our country, and we should work with them to promote equality between nations. If we don't ask whether they have aggressive ambitions or whether they sympathize with China, but regard all foreigners as imperialists, and don't cooperate with them no matter what, and don't get close to them no matter when, it will turn all friends into enemies and put our country in an isolated situation. Nothing is more foolish than this. To achieve national independence and international equality, we must rely on our own efforts. We cannot rely solely on the sympathy of foreigners, but why should we reject people from thousands of miles away and cut off their sympathy? Moreover, the survival of a nation in the world depends on national self-confidence. Now, the Chinese people are afraid to approach foreigners and fear being used by foreigners, which is a loss of our nation's credibility. It is understandable that the general public does not understand this meaning. However, it is incomprehensible that comrades in our party, who are responsible for leading the people, panic when they talk about foreigners. The initiation of the Pacific International Association's meeting in China this time mostly came from the YMCA, but the formal invitation was issued by the government. The government did this to connect the feelings of people between nations and to publicize our country's unequal status. There is absolutely no religious significance in it. Even if it were a religious gathering, citizens have freedom of belief, and no one can oppose it. Moreover, the will of the Party Headquarters and the government should be unified, and their actions should be consistent. Otherwise, it will not only lose the people's faith in the Party Headquarters and the government, but also make foreigners laugh. I hope that all comrades will examine the nature of the Pacific International Association and study it, and not be used by the reactionary forces for counter-propaganda, blindly follow and act recklessly, so as to expose their weaknesses and be ridiculed by others.)</p>
<p>▲At 10:00 am on the same day, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the late leader Sun Yat-sen. Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Peide, Niu Yongjian, Wang Boqun, He Yaozu, and other officials, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony, and Cai Yuanpei reported on the flood relief issue, stating that according to the latest report, the number of victims has reached 70 to 80 million, accounting for one-sixth of the country's total population. If there are no good measures, it will lead to the greatest danger. Now, the government and society are actively carrying out relief measures, and there is hope that they can overcome the difficulties. Next, he gave a detailed explanation of the opinions on the issue of disaster relief, both short-term and long-term, from the eighth annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society, and said that the society's earnest intentions are to stop the war. We express our deep sympathy. The current government, except for the main force of the communists, is doing its best to avoid war in other areas. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>

After a short rest, the Japanese Ambassador was invited to meet with the Chairman. After the ceremony was completed, the Japanese Ambassador began to deliver his address, which was translated by Hayashiide Kenjiro. After the translation, the Japanese Ambassador presented his credentials. Chairman Chiang accepted the credentials and handed them over to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. After reading the reply in Chinese, Chairman Chiang shook hands with the Japanese Ambassador and talked for a moment. The Japanese Ambassador bid farewell and, at about 12:00, was accompanied by the welcoming officials back to the Japanese Consulate in the original cars. The address and reply are appended below:</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador's Address: His Majesty the Emperor of Japan has appointed me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China. I am honored to present my credentials. The close relationship between our two countries is not only for the happiness of the two countries, but also the key to peace in East Asia and the foundation for the well-being of the world. My government pays special attention to this point. My government sincerely hopes to increase the understanding and sympathy between the governments and peoples of the two countries in order to fulfill the natural mission of the two countries. As the Ambassador appointed to your country, I am willing to do my best to achieve this goal. I hope for your country's assistance so that I can fulfill my responsibilities.

Today, Your Excellency presented your credentials in the capacity of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, which I accept with great pleasure. The National Government has always attached great importance to solidarity between countries of the same continent and the same race. Your Excellency has served in China for many years and will surely be able to enhance understanding and sympathy between the governments and peoples of the two countries, so that our two countries can benefit together. The government of this country will sincerely assist Your Excellency with the convenience required for your duties here. I sincerely wish His Majesty the Emperor of your country good health, and I also wish Your Excellency a pleasant journey.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Supervisory Yuan's Disaster Inspectors Request Prompt Promulgation of Anti-Corruption Regulations <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Supervisory Yuan previously sent Supervisors Gao Yihan and Councilor Hong Lanyou as special commissioners to inspect the disaster situation in northern Jiangsu and investigate the disaster situation in the counties along the canal, as well as investigate whether water conservancy personnel had been negligent in advance prevention projects. After more than ten days, they personally visited the people to inquire. Now it is over. Hong first passed through Zhenjiang yesterday and returned to Nanjing. Gao stayed in Zhenjiang for a while, and will also return to Nanjing to report after consulting the files of the Construction Department today. Yesterday, the two gentlemen jointly telegraphed President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan, requesting the Central Government to promptly promulgate anti-corruption regulations. The original telegram is as follows: (President Yu of the Nanjing Supervisory Yuan: This time, the Jianghe River overflowed, and the disaster situation has spread almost all over the country. The people have suffered deeply, and the country has been severely damaged. It is unprecedented in the past 100 years. Whether the officials responsible for local and water conservancy affairs have been negligent in the repair of embankments and waterways should be thoroughly investigated and reported for deliberation to extend the national law. However, after this major disaster, the plan for reconstruction and disaster relief is urgent. The government is concerned about the victims and issued huge national debts. Local people are motivated by public justice, transporting grain and property. Those in charge should be cautious and employ the right people to live up to the government's intention to cherish the people and comfort the victims' hopes. However, it has always been difficult to avoid corruption in disaster relief, and the implementation and distribution personnel often have various corrupt practices, such as incomplete distribution and theft and sale of relief supplies. As a result, a kind of relief funds is difficult to reach half of the people after being exploited layer by layer, which is very heartbreaking to say. It is believed that the disaster area is vast and the number of victims is large. Disaster relief cannot be completed in a short time. If anti-corruption regulations are not promulgated promptly, it will not be enough to rectify the cunning customs and expect to give real benefits to the victims. Therefore, I dare to telegraph to Your Excellency, requesting the Central Government to promptly promulgate this item of regulations to rectify discipline and attach importance to disaster relief. Whether it is appropriate is still up to Your Excellency to decide. Gao Yihan Hong Lanyou kowtow,</p>

<p>No Progress in the Korean Massacre</p>
<p>The Nakamura Incident is Under Investigation</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Jiang Zuobin, is going to Japan to take office. Because there are many outstanding issues in the Sino-Japanese Northeast negotiations, and the Wanbaoshan and Nakamura incidents are the most important issues in the recent negotiations, he made a special trip to Peiping to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang to discuss them. This morning at 10:10, he took the Peiping-Pukou express train through Tianjin. I met Mr. Jiang in the car. According to the conversation, the relationship between China and Japan is close, and all problems can be solved by peaceful means. After I arrived in Nanjing, I have requested instructions from Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang on the diplomatic policy towards Japan. Deputy Commander Zhang sits in Peiping and is responsible for important internal and external affairs in North China, so I came to Peiping to discuss everything. I will stay in Peiping for one or two days. After meeting with Deputy Commander Zhang, I will go to Korea via Shenyang to represent the National Government in consoling the compatriots who were victimized and bring 20,000 yuan allocated by Chairman Chiang to comfort the families of the victims in Korea. The investigation matters have been reported in detail by the former Ambassador Wang. I am just taking the opportunity to investigate the latest situation of overseas Chinese there. I will stay in Korea for about one or two days and then go to Japan. I will arrive in Tokyo around the 20th. I immediately asked about the recent negotiations on the Korean massacre. Mr. Jiang was silent for a moment before answering that there was no progress. We are now trying our best to negotiate in order to achieve the goals of compensation and punishment of the murderers. I also asked about the Nakamura incident. The Japanese side has been exaggerating the propaganda so much. What is the situation? Jiang replied that when I departed from Nanjing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received the report from the local government or the Japanese protest. It is currently under investigation. However, in the Korean massacre, the Japanese side killed hundreds of overseas Chinese, injured thousands, and lost more than 10 million yuan in property. Our authorities are still using appropriate methods to resolve this matter. Nakamura is just a Japanese soldier. Even if this unfortunate thing happened, compared with the Korean case, it is like heaven and earth. It is not difficult to resolve it on the international norm. I think the Japanese diplomatic authorities will never make a fuss over a trifle. As he said this, the car had started, so I said goodbye and left.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Zhang Zhijiang Begs for Disaster Relief for Taixian County <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Pacification Supervisor Zhang Zhijiang, in view of the severe flood in northern Jiangsu, telegraphed charitable organizations in various provinces to request relief on the one hand, and donated his salary and sent personnel to various disaster areas to distribute emergency relief on the other hand. Yesterday, he telegraphed various places again to appeal for relief funds for the victims in Taixian County. The original telegram reads: Urgent, Nanjing Flood Relief Committee, Zhenwu Committee, Shanghai Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, Flood Relief Associations in various provinces, Zhenjiang Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, and Northern Jiangsu Flood Relief Association. Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu have reported the flood and emergency relief situations by telegram many times. Recently, I received a telegram from Taixian County Magistrate Yi, Standing Committee Member of the County Party Department Chen Mei, and Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Cao Deliang, stating that the Song Deputy Officer came to give relief grain, and the officials and people were grateful. Although the water level has risen and fallen in recent days, the number of houses in each village that have been blown down by the wind is increasing every day. Charitable organizations have tried their best to rescue more than 20,000 people, who have fled across the river to find food. 30-40% have relied on relatives, and 30% have been taken in by the government. There are still 400,000 victims trapped in the water, reluctant to leave their homes. Moreover, victims from Xingdong County are coming to Taixian County to request shelter in an endless stream. Now, grain, money, clothing, and quilts are all lacking. I sincerely appeal for more relief funds and grain to be allocated to maintain them. According to Xinghua County Magistrate Hua Zhen's report, the entire county has become a disaster area, with about 500,000 victims urgently needing rescue. As autumn is approaching, the victims in the disaster area are suffering from hunger and cold. I implore your association to quickly devise a good plan to provide assistance to save the victims and avert the disaster. I am extremely grateful and look forward to it. Zhang Zhijiang kowtows.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Results of the Shandong Village Clearing Conference <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The province is divided into six major districts and three minor districts</p>
<p>The work steps are to first suppress bandits and then clear the villages</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government and Shandong-Henan Village Clearing Supervisor, specially convened the division commanders to Jinan to hold a bandit suppression conference in order to plan the village clearing in the province. Last night (11th) at 6:00 pm, after the 20th Division Commander Sun Tongxuan came to Jinan from Zhoucun Defense Zone, the bandit suppression conference was held at the General Headquarters at 7:00 pm that night. Those who attended included Zhang Yue, Director of the Counselor's Office of the Village Clearing Supervisor's Office, Li Zongbi, Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters, and the directors of various departments, 20th Division Commander Sun Tongxuan, 29th Division Commander Cao Fulin, 22nd Division Commander Gu Liangmin, 74th Division Commander Qiao Lizhi, and 81st Division Commander Zhan Shutang. Chairman Han Fuju presided over the meeting and decided that each division would launch a large-scale bandit suppression campaign in its respective area, limited to two months to clear the bandits. The province is divided into six districts and three small districts. The area near Jinan is one district, which is the responsibility of 74th Division Commander Qiao Lizhi. The Jinan business district is the responsibility of Lei Taiping, the commander of the Pistol Brigade. The area east of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and along the Jiaoji Railway (Zhoucun Weixian) north to Huimin in northern Shandong is one district, which is said to be centered on Zouping and is the responsibility of 20th Division Commander Sun Tongxuan. Northern Shandong (west of Huimin) and western Shandong are one district, which is the responsibility of 29th Division Commander Cao Fulin and Cavalry Brigade Commander Li Xuande. Southern Shandong, including Linyi, Tancheng, Feixian, and Yishui, is one district, which is the responsibility of 80th Division Commander Zhan Shutang. Taian, Yanzhou, Jining, and Caozhou are one district, which is the responsibility of 22nd Division Commander Gu Liangmin. Eastern Shandong, east of Weixian, is one district, which is the responsibility of Liu Zhennian, Commander of the Central 21st Division. The three small districts are: Linqing is one district, which is the responsibility of Zhao Renquan, Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Shandong Republic; Jining is one district, which is the responsibility of Gu Liangyou, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Shandong Militia; and the area around Xintai is one district, which is the responsibility of Xie Shuxian, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Shandong Militia. The above three small districts are affiliated troops and are subject to the command of the large district where they are located. The conference also decided to carry out village clearing after the bandits in the province are eliminated. The conference also agreed on the steps for bandit suppression, planning to use the troops of Gu Liangmin and Zhan Shutang to jointly suppress the bandits Guo Mafeng and Liu Guitang in Mengshan, Baodugu, and other places in southern Shandong. Ma Hongkui's 15th Route Army was originally stationed in the area of Taian, Lincheng, Tengxian, Zaozhuang, Linbo, and Jining. Now, Ma's troops have been ordered to be transferred to Henan. Gu Liangmin's troops will fill the defense. Gu's Ning Chunxiao Brigade is now stationed in Jining, Qufu, and Sishui. Tang Kesun Brigade is now stationed in Tengxian and Juancheng. The division headquarters and independent battalions are stationed in Yanzhou (now stationed in Weixian, Qingzhou, Jiaoxian, and Gaomi). Zhan Shutang's troops will be transferred to defend Linyi, Yishui, Feixian, and Tancheng. The division headquarters will be located in Linyi. The Yun Qichang Brigade of the division stationed in Jiaoxian will be transferred from Jiaoxian to Linyi and Tancheng via Zhucheng and Juxian. Zhan Shutang will lead the division headquarters and independent units from Weixian to Linyi via Anqiu and Juxian. The Tang Bangzhi Brigade stationed in Qingzhou will be transferred from Linqu to Yishui and Feixian. After the two divisions arrive at their destinations, they will begin to jointly suppress the bandits in Mengshan and Baodugu. The troops of Cao Fulin, who is responsible for the area west of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway on the north bank of the Yellow River, are now stationed in Jinan. The Li Hanzhang Brigade of the division is stationed between Dezhou and Jinan. The Chen Dexin Brigade is stationed in Dongchang and Guantao. The Rong Guangxing Brigade will be transferred back to Jinan. The Cavalry Brigade Li Xuande is stationed in Xiajin and is responsible for the area east of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and along the Jiaoji Railway on the north bank of the Yellow River. Sun Tongxuan's troops are stationed in Zhoucun. The Zhao Xinde Brigade of the division is now stationed in Zhanhua and Lijin. The Ma Jingong Brigade is stationed in Boshan. The 58th Brigade is stationed in Weixian with one regiment in Dexian. The Xie Shijie Artillery Regiment is also stationed in Dexian and is now transferred to Zhoucun, Qingzhou, and Weixian to fill the defense left by Zhan Shutang's troops. The division commanders are still in Jinan, claiming departure expenses and supplies. It is said that they will return to their defense zones within one or two days to prepare for departure. It is expected that they will arrive at their destinations around October 10 and begin to suppress bandits. This is because the busy farming season will have passed by then, and the militia can also help the government army suppress bandits. (September 12)</p>
<h3 id="e81">End of the First Fleet Naval Exercises <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The First Fleet of the Navy, under the command of Chen Jiliang, sailed from Shanghai in the latter part of last month with ten warships, including the cruisers "Hai Chou" and "Hai Rong," the gunboats "Da Tong," "Zi Qiang," "Yu Zhang," "Yong Jian," "Yong Ji," and "Jian Kang," and the training ships "Tong Ji" and "Ying Rui," to conduct naval exercises in the waters off Fujian and Zhejiang. Starting from Sanduao and maneuvering to Xiangshan Harbor, they practiced heavy artillery firing, torpedo firing, and various maneuvers with submarine search formations along the way. These exercises have now concluded. On September 4th, he led all the ships to Xiamen, went ashore to inspect various modern constructions and historical sites in Xiamen, and attended banquets hosted by political and military circles. On the 8th, the entire fleet sailed to the province. At 11:00 AM on the 9th, they arrived at Mawei. Huang Maohe, the commander of the Marine Corps regiment, Shao Bin, the director of the Navy's provincial office, Mao Zhencai, the commander of the Changle Fort, and Jiang Zhizhuang, a staff officer of the Ministry of the Navy, all went aboard the cruiser "Hai Chou" to pay their respects to Commander Chen. On the evening of the 10th, Staff Officer Zheng, acting commander of the Mawei Naval Port Command, hosted a banquet for all the officers at the Navy's Recreation Club. Currently, Chen plans to lead the captains of each ship to the province on the 11th to visit Yang Shuzhuang at Guling and report on the exercises. After resting for a few days, he will lead the ships back to Shanghai and then to their original stations.</p>
<p>The "Jiang Yuan" transport ship, stationed along the Min River, sailed to Xiamen a few days ago to transport the Guangdong Provincial Security Force, consisting of the Huang Gu and Fan Zong units stationed in Tong'an, to Beijing for reorganization. While sailing through Xiaomai Island in the Xinghua waters, it struck a reef, and part of the hold was flooded, creating a very dangerous situation. It immediately sent out a wireless distress signal. Upon receiving the report, the Mawei Naval Port Command immediately dispatched the gunboat "Yong Ji" to the rescue, transferring the ship's officers and soldiers to the rescue vessel. The damaged ship is now being repaired by craftsmen. (September 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Shanghai Soong Residents in Beijing Urge Immediate Repair of Jinshanwei Seawall <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the seawalls in Jiangsu Province have repeatedly faced danger. The Baoshan seawall project is perceived to be extremely hazardous, and the Songjiang seawall has also shown repeated signs of damage. For the sake of preventing future disasters, people from various former Song Prefecture counties residing in Beijing have appealed to the provincial government to allocate funds and select personnel to quickly repair and reinforce the seawall. The telegram reads as follows: To Chairman Ye of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang: The flood in Jiangsu Province has caused widespread disaster, with the situation in Jiangnan being slightly less severe than in Jiangbei. Although the former Song Prefecture counties have also suffered losses, they have fortunately avoided being submerged. However, the Jinshanwei seawall has been neglected for years, and sections two, three, and four have recently collapsed one after another. As the autumn tides will soon rise, if unforeseen circumstances occur, the coastal counties will again be entirely inundated. It is not only the people who mourn the loss of their fisheries, but the entire province of Jiangsu will have no clean land left. Thinking of our homeland, we tremble with fear. We urge you to allocate special funds and select personnel familiar with seawall construction to work with local officials to quickly repair and reinforce the seawall, thereby averting major disasters and ensuring the safety of the people. We humbly request your prompt action. The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Soong Residents Association in Beijing, Zhu Shuyuan, Huang Duanlu, and Xia Guangyu, respectfully petition.</p>

<p>(40) Record of a conversation with Luo (transliteration) on March 13 (regarding issues such as Spireddonov's (transliteration) trip north to prepare for worker struggles in factories and attempts to sabotage the National Army).</p>
<p>Spireddonov's (transliteration) report on his inspection trip north: The activities of the right-wing faction of the Communist Party have not only split the party but also the organization of the masses, which is very unfortunate. The right-leaning elements openly violate the interests of the workers and put forward anti-struggle slogans. The work of the trade union under the leadership of Li Lisan has not paid attention to this, so few railway workers are organized. Comrade, who used to be the leader of the railway workers' movement, has recently turned into an opportunist. There is almost no mass movement. As for Tianjin, there is even a lack of mass organization. Rong Nanchun (transliteration) previously wanted to use the party organization of the railway factory as the basis for his right-wing faction, but he was recently arrested. He had great influence in the Beijing-Ningbo Railway, with 130 to 140 workers under his command. Since his arrest, these workers have been trying to rescue him and collecting money to help him. We have seven trade union members in Changxindian on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and there are also seventy or eighty people on the whole railway, but there is still a lack of proper organization. Railway workers have recently been very vocal in opposing dismissals and arrests. They also have a good understanding of the Red Army. Last November, they planned to convene a railway workers' conference in the White Area, but after receiving instructions, they changed it to the Red Area. At that time, many representatives participated, but because they could not return to their original places, they had to join the Red Army. Our current task is how to consolidate the foundation of railway workers, and we must exclude Rong and others before we can step up the daily struggle. The Northern Railway Workers' Union has recently sent a comrade to inspect the Beijing-Ningbo line. As for the Beijing-Hankou Railway, there are red trade union posters at every station, called "Locomotive." The comrade leading this work is Zhu Chuting (transliteration), who was sent by the National Labor Union. We are now planning to convene a conference of workers on the entire Beijing-Hankou Railway on April 1, but the date may be flexible because it will take some time to select representatives from various places (the conference is scheduled to last one day, with about ten representatives). We must carefully organize the original seventy or eighty people to make them an action group. This responsibility will also be borne by Comrade Zhu Chuting, who will plan and convene the conference. At present, the Railway Workers' Union must send ten people to the northern section to take on guidance work, and these people must be given short-term training in advance. The National Labor Union must also assign one person to Tianjin to take on this work. The best candidate would be the current core secretary of the National Labor Union (the reason why we are making such a suggestion is that this important work cannot be handled without someone with considerable ability). Luo (transliteration) said that he would personally go there to work for two weeks, but if the National Labor Union can find another suitable person, it would be better to send someone else. We have recently sent a comrade to Manchuria to organize a trade union (this person's name is Wang Qinyin, transliteration), but the workers there requested that a certain comrade who used to work on the Siberian Railway and is now in Liaoning be sent to lead them. Unfortunately, they did not mention the name, so it is impossible to verify. The Standing Committee of the National Labor Union is now planning to reorganize the Railway Workers' Committee and send new members to strengthen its forces. They decided to send ten students from the north to work in various factories in Tianjin (according to Spireddonov's (transliteration) report, it was submitted to the Central Political Bureau, so this decision is suspected to have come from that bureau). The comrade who used to work in the Tianjin Trade Union is now said to be assigned to work in the mining area, but this work originally belongs to the party's scope, so we must first obtain the party's permission before we can make a decision. We each have ten comrades working in the four major coal mines in Tianjin, but the right-wing faction is very active there, so a few comrades have been arrested. Moreover, because of the activities of the right-wing faction there, we cannot send more qualified comrades there, because they would be in danger of being exposed as soon as they arrived. Regarding the above report, the National Labor Union's future resolutions will still follow the opinions of the Political Bureau. However, since we have not yet organized a trade union in that area, what name will we use to call on the workers in that area to engage in struggle in the future is still a problem. Recently, two new comrades have returned here. One is the chairman of the Hong Kong Labor Union, who had to leave Hong Kong because his work there has recently encountered obstacles and plans to be sent to the Soviet district to work. The other person comes from Liaoning. They will have a detailed report in a few days. (To be continued)</p>

<p>A Thief Named A Cai Has Been Arrested The notorious thief Jiang A Cai repeatedly robbed in San Guan Tang, You Li, Cheng Shan, and other places in Zhejiang Province. Later, he used the alias Shen Rongjiang, and carrying the stolen goods, he hid in Suzhou City at No. 16 Jinshi River. The Third District of the Zhejiang Inland River Police learned from the captured thieves A Fu, A De, and Zhou A Si about Jiang's hiding place. They dispatched Detective Captain Pan Xiru, leading investigator Zhu Fulin, who came to Suzhou to meet with the second and fifth branch stations of the Public Security Bureau, and arrested Jiang at the address at 11:00 AM on the 14th. They also seized three leather suitcases, three wooden suitcases, one handbag, one tin suitcase, and one silk tent. He was temporarily detained at the Public Security Bureau, awaiting transfer for prosecution.</p>
<p>Bandits in Taihu Lake Are Rampant Again Villagers Zhou A Fu and Zhou Shenquan were sailing a boat of pigs into the city on the 14th when, passing the experimental rice field in Shili Ting, they were suddenly met by a bandit boat with five bandits on board, who attempted to rob them. The patrolling police Han Wendou and Sun Bingnan noticed and opened fire on the bandits. The bandits also returned fire with pistols. After holding out for half an hour, the bandits ran out of ammunition and fled. In addition, Zhuang Songqing of Caojiabang in Hengjing and the home of Shen Zumin in Wujiabang reported to the Eighth Public Security Bureau that bandits were planning to rob them, and police were dispatched to protect them. As a result, a bandit scout named Zhang Jindada was arrested and sent to the city. Furthermore, Lu Huiqing's son Chan Sheng and nephew Fu Bao from Dongxie Road of the town were on a boat when they encountered a bandit boat with seven or eight bandits, with a female bandit rowing the boat. The boat was full of guns of all kinds, and they kidnapped the two men along with the boat. Yesterday (the 14th), Lu came to the city to report and request rescue.</p>

<p>The Water Conservancy Problems in the Fourth and Fifth Districts Have Been Resolved This year, there have been continuous rains in the summer and autumn, and water levels have risen everywhere, turning the fields into a vast expanse of water. The original San Gan River runs through the fourth and fifth districts of the county. Its upper reaches are Pucheng in the fifth district, and its lower reaches are Shazhou City in the fourth district. As the river flowed downstream, the fields of Shazhou were further damaged. Therefore, the farmers of Shazhou suddenly dug mud to build a dam at the southern end of the lower reaches of the San Gan River, preventing the water from flowing downstream. Once the river was blocked, the water could not flow through, which was very detrimental to the fifth district. Therefore, they gathered thousands of villagers and sent dozens of representatives to the county to petition. According to County Chief Tan, the fault lies with the fourth district, and they should be ordered to open the dam as soon as possible. However, the people of Shazhou refused, declaring that they would rather die in the ditch than give up their dam. As a result, the dam has not been opened, and it has been two months without a solution. On the 11th, County Chief Tan went to the countryside to inspect the disaster situation and also inspected the dam. He also confirmed that it was necessary to open it and ordered Zhu Qingnan, the head of the fourth district, to open the dam within three days, and left Inspector Lu of the Public Security Bureau to monitor the situation in the countryside. When the villagers heard about this, they immediately gathered thousands of farmers to surround the district office, demanding that the dam be stopped, otherwise they would gather and die on the dam. At that time, District Chief Zhu and Inspector Lu repeatedly persuaded them and agreed to hold a citizens' meeting to resolve the issue, and the villagers dispersed. The conference decided at Wujie Bridge on the 13th, and the citizens of Shazhou again requested District Chief Zhu to consider public opinion and not accept any conditions to remove the dam privately, and told him the reasons why it could not be removed, otherwise the villagers would have to gather and die on the dam. At that time, the farmers, with a large number of people, pushed out Liu Zhu-ru, Huang Bao-zhen, and Huang Jin-hu as representatives. After the meeting, they asked Yang Zai-tian, a merchant in the Shazhou district, to mediate. As a result, Tian Yang guaranteed to return the fourth district farmers' loss of hundreds of yuan for building the dam. They agreed to the removal of the dam, so work began on the 14th to remove the dam, in compliance with the county order.</p>
<p>A Fire in a Carpenter's Shop, the Fate of a Woman and Two Children Unknown A carpenter's shop was opened at No. 70 Dongzhong Lane in the county town, owned by a man named Xiang Ersi. There was a lot of wood in the house. At around 11:00 PM on the 13th, the apprentices and carpenters were all asleep. Unexpectedly, an apprentice named Dalang suddenly heard crackling sounds downstairs and got up to see flames burning brightly. He shouted wildly for the master, Zou Wen-sheng, who heard the noise and saw the flames, and immediately took the quilts and other items from the bed downstairs and fled. However, the fire was so fierce that it was out of control. His wife and daughter, Da Mei, and another baby in swaddling clothes had not yet escaped. He shouted anxiously downstairs, but the stairs had broken, making it impossible to get down. Later, he used another ladder to meet them on the street, but they did not come down. Therefore, it is unknown whether they were buried in the fire, dead or alive. Also, Zou's mother, an old woman, was still sick in bed. She jumped out of the window to escape, slightly injured, and was sent to the Yuhe Hospital for treatment. In addition, a yellow dog was burned to death. As for the buildings, the back was the chaff room of the Yifengyuan Teahouse, so the back of the teahouse was also affected. In total, the carpenter's shop, with two rooms and two courtyards, and the upstairs and downstairs buildings were destroyed, and a part of the back of the Yifengyuan Teahouse was also damaged, resulting in a considerable loss. As for the cause of the fire, some said it started in the kitchen downstairs, while others said it was caused by a swallow's nest on the roof. There is no consensus.</p>

<p>The Issue of Jurisdiction in Punishing Bandits In the case of punishing bandits, our province has now established temporary command agencies due to the division of areas for bandit suppression. When counties capture bandits, it often involves the issue of jurisdiction in trials. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Pacification Commissioner's Office have settled on four measures. The first two measures relate to the punishment of bandits captured by the bandit suppression troops, which are handled directly by the bandit suppression military judge and are not related to the county magistrate. The third measure stipulates that when the county government captures bandits, it should comply with the provincial government's telegram, which is handled by the county government's trial and reported directly to the provincial department for verification. The fourth measure stipulates that cases involving communists should be sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Temporary Military Law Joint Trial Office for interrogation. After receiving the order, County Chief Chen of our county has followed the procedures. For example, Zhou Xinshun, a robber who was executed by shooting a few days ago, was handled in accordance with the provincial government's telegram. As for the communist cases previously solved in Wuxi, such as the Sima Peisheng case, a total of 53 cases have also been submitted to the Yunfa Joint Trial Office a few days ago in accordance with the fourth measure, requesting a review for compliance, and then police officers will be sent to escort the criminals to the province for legal action. False Reporting of Robbery Out of Personal Grudge Tan Weinan, the director of the Twelfth Branch of the Public Security Bureau in the Sixth District (Tianxiashi), received a report from a resident Guo Boxuan of Daixiang on the afternoon of the 11th of this month that a bandit named Dai A Da was knocking on the back door, intending to enter the house to rob, and that he had now been arrested. Director Tan immediately sent patrol officer Zhu Yunjie to accompany Guo Boxuan to take Dai to the bureau. According to Dai A Da's confession, a man named A Gen came to his house that night and invited him to Guo Boxuan's house for a chat. When he arrived at Guo's house, four or five strong men held a rope and tied him up, falsely accusing him of being a thief and arresting him privately, requesting that he be redressed. According to Guo Boxuan and the three arresting officers Zhao Longxing and Shen Jinshi, Dai A Da, the bandit they captured, was the main offender who killed Guo Boxuan's late father, Guo Zizhen. Director Tan, seeing that the confessions of both parties were different, sent bureau member Huang Dexian to investigate Guo's house. According to the long-term worker Wang Xiaofu, Dai A Da had just returned to Wuxi last night, and Boxuan ordered A Gen to invite Dai to his house and then tied him up, claiming that he was robbing and destroying the back door himself. However, the details of the case seem to be a personal grudge. Yesterday, Tan prepared a document and sent both parties to the Public Security Bureau and then to the County Court for trial.</p>

The severity of the disaster and the extent of the disaster area are unprecedented. Yesterday, he specially sent a public letter to the local flood relief association, asking for quick allocation of funds to help save the lives of the people.</p>

<p>The Emergency Relief Association Ordered the Salvage of Floating Corpses The Jiangsu Provincial Flood Emergency Relief Association yesterday sent a telegram to the county chiefs of Zhenjiang and Jiangbei, stating that the Fish Telegram from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association's office in Yangzhou had been received, stating that the disaster victims from various places reported that the dead bodies in the river were floating around indefinitely, requesting measures to be taken to salvage them to prevent epidemics. Our office is now urgently saving lives and is busy with work and cannot take care of everything. Therefore, we specially send this telegram to you, asking you to send telegrams to the county chiefs in each disaster area to take measures to salvage and bury the corpses, in order to prevent epidemics. You should follow the instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Gaoyou <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>A Record of the Gaoyou Relief Situation Details of the flood disaster in Gaoyou have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that there are currently three relief agencies in the area: (1) The Shanghai Hua Yang Yizhen Association's office in Gaoyou, located in Wanfeng Sauce Garden in the South Gate. According to Mr. Wang, the owner of the store, the Shanghai Hua Yang Yizhen Association sent German missionary Ke Weilian (transliteration) to Gaoyou on the 8th to establish the office in Gaoyou. Mr. Ke telegraphed the General Association on the 9th, requesting that 6,000 yuan be remitted to Gaoyou for distribution. Mr. Ke went to Xinghua last night to investigate the disaster situation. (2) The Shanghai China Jisheng Association's office in Gaoyou, located in Wanhe Lu Chenhang. According to Mr. Yin Shunzhang, an official of the office, the Shanghai General Association sent one person in charge, Zhang Jixian, and seven staff members to Gaoyou for relief. They have now transported 3,000 bags of flour and 200 bags of rice, but the distribution has been temporarily suspended due to the lack of specific measures. Commissioner Zhang went to Shanghai on the 9th to report on the disaster situation. (3) The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association's office in Gaoyou is temporarily working on a boat near the Pipa Gate. According to Mr. Zhu Qilu, the person in charge of relief affairs who came to Gaoyou, the General Association not only sent me to Gaoyou for relief, but also sent 12 staff members to assist. He personally brought 10,000 yuan in relief funds with him. This morning (the 10th), he sent a boat to Zhenjiang to load 150 bags of rice first. The rest of the relief supplies will be requested successively in the future due to the lack of accurate numbers. Regarding rescue, the Gaoyou Flood Temporary Relief Association has been requested to hire 40 private boats to go to various villages for rescue, rescuing about 1,000 refugees every day. After the rescue, they are temporarily sent to the reception center. Those who volunteer to go south are sent separately. Regarding reception, there is now a reception center in Dawang Temple, which is the responsibility of Mr. Zhao Huchen. It receives about 4,000 refugees every day. Some stay for one night and are sent south, while others who do not want to go elsewhere are given two meals a day. The order is good. There is also a reception center in Yongxing Temple in Jieshou, which receives more than 400 refugees every day.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Letter from the Representatives of the Disaster Victims in Suining County <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Shenbao Hall, respected: The flood disaster in Suining is extremely serious, with no autumn harvest at all. The disaster victims are all over the fields, and the dangerous situation is everywhere. We have telegraphed to the authorities at all levels and various charitable organizations, appealing for relief. Unexpectedly, on September 1, there was another continuous rainfall, day and night. The floodwater in the fields was more than ten feet deep, not only submerging the replanted buckwheat and vegetables, but also washing away people, livestock, and houses. Such a terrible disaster is unprecedented. The disaster victims are in dire need of rescue. In addition to sending telegrams, please send someone to investigate and provide relief, so as to avoid the danger of chaos in the country. We are very anxious and await your orders. Respectfully, the representatives of the disaster victims in Suining County, Zhang Ziyun, Xu Shaoping, Wang Huaju, Zhuo Zaiqing, Liu Ludong, Yuan Xianzhi, and Yuan Xingcun.</p>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam: We were shocked to read the special telegram from Zhenjiang on the 3rd in your newspaper's "Domestic Important News" column on September 4, which stated that the number of disaster victims in each county was about 30,000 in Gaoyou and Lishui. The flood disaster in Gaoyou is the most serious in Jiangnan, with 195 breaches and about 160,000 disaster victims. We have repeatedly telegraphed abroad for relief and reported to the province, all stating that there are more than 100,000 disaster victims. The statement that there are 30,000 disaster victims in Gaoyou is definitely not true. Please correct it. This is very important. Gaoyou County Flood Relief Association, September 9</p>

<p>In the women's 50-meter final the day before yesterday, apart from Zhang Pingxian who clearly reached the finish line first, the remaining four were very close when crossing the finish line, making it difficult to see clearly at the time, which led to questions about the results. The finish line judges discussed it once the night before, but without result. It was not until yesterday morning that the head judge decided that there was no problem with Zhang Pingxian being first. The four ladies who crossed the line together, Si Tuwei, Li Baohui, Xue Qiding and Ma Yufang will re-run the final today at 2 PM to determine the positions for second, third and fourth, in order to be fair. The organizing committee notified all the athletes yesterday, fearing they might not arrive by this morning. We hope that the four ladies will be on site promptly at 2 PM this afternoon to await the re-run final.</p>

<p>Straight Three Wins Over Daxia</p>
<p>The two volleyball powerhouses on the sea, Fudan and Daxia Universities, competed at the Longpo Race Road field yesterday afternoon, with a large crowd of men and women watching. Fudan showed their best skills and defeated Daxia straight in three sets to win the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Scores of the Three Sets <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Set No. Result of First Half Winner</p>
<p>Set 1 11 to 6 21 to 13 Fudan Wins Daxia</p>
<p>Set 2 11 to 5 21 to 10 Fudan Wins Daxia</p>
<p>Set 3 11 to 6 21 to 12 Fudan Wins Daxia</p>
<p>▲ Fudan Team Shows Great Power From yesterday's match, it is clear how the situation was from the scores. It was far from the fierce and close match that was hoped for. Daxia was not Fudan's opponent at all. In the first set, Fudan won the first half 11 to 6 and won the first set 21 to 13. In the second set, Daxia was still not in good form, and Fudan again won first 11 to 5, ending 21 to 10. In the third set, Daxia once led 5 to 4, but after one point, the situation changed again, 11 to 6, and the set ended 21 to 12. As a result, the score was 3 to 0.</p>
<p>▲ General Fei's Reputation is Well-Deserved Fudan's performance yesterday was much better than the day before, with a hundred times more momentum. Whether it was cooperation or smashing, everything was perfect. General Fei, Cao Zan, showed his amazing skills, striking without mercy. The balls that went out of bounds the day before were all within the lines yesterday. Daxia was like being under artillery fire for three sets.</p>
<p>▲ Chen Baoqiu Plays Sick There are reasons why Daxia was inferior. Their main player, Chen Baoqiu, participated in the match while sick, with a white cloth tied tightly around his head. His decisive smash that used to determine the outcome was rarely seen yesterday, only two or three times in total. He had to switch to a winger in the third set, and defender Wei Dingyi's smashes were mostly unsuccessful, so they lost.</p>

The Jinan female players never took the field. Today at 2:30 PM, Southeast will play Hai Xing, and at 4 PM, Aiguo will play Wuben, to compete for the final spot.</p>

<p>Chen Nan did not come, Aiguo still mobilized the entire team, but the female generals had nowhere to use their skills, so they did some light practice and watched Southeast, Nanyang, Fudan and Daxia compete. Their lineup is as follows:</p>

<p>Southeast Twenty-One to Eleven Nanyang</p>
<p>Twenty-One to Eight Points</p>
<p>In the match between Southeast and Nanyang, there was a phenomenon: the server scored every time, because the return was weak and the setting and saving were poor. Southeast's middle route was very good, and their backhand and smash were very impressive. Their teamwork was also much better than Nanyang's. Nanyang tried their best to follow from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Five to One</p>
<p>In the first half of the Zhixing vs. Hudong match, Zhixing had a good momentum but repeatedly failed to score, only scoring one goal, winning 1-0. In the second half, Hudong gradually showed relaxation, and Zhixing scored two more goals, making it 3-0. At this point, Hudong bravely counterattacked, and right winger Lin Anhuai scored a goal, 1-3. In the end, Zhixing scored two more goals, ending the game 5-1.

<p>Qingnian and Hualing were evenly matched, with little difference in strength, so this match was the most interesting of the three days. The game had its ups and downs, and the fight was intense. Hualing failed because their warriors were not complete, and Qingnian's complete lineup gave them an advantage. In the first half, Qingnian center forward Xu Buyun scored a goal. In the second half, right inside winger Pan Shizao broke through the goal again. Hualing did not score any goals. They missed a penalty kick once, resulting in complete defeat.

<p>Qian Wenbao Suffers a Miserable Defeat Due to Injured Leg</p>
<p>In yesterday's men's singles tennis second round, the match between Yu Tianguang and Qian Wenbao was the most important. The skills of the two were difficult to distinguish, and the winner was not decided until 34 sets had been played. Qian had sores on both legs and could not run, but his smashes were strong and powerful, enough to control everything. It was unfortunate that the two met in the second round. The complete results of the second round are as follows:</p>
<p>Qian Yaobin beats Xiong Daji Six to One, Six to Three</p>
<p>Chen Xianzhang beats Fang Rongsheng Six to Zero, Six to One</p>
<p>Liu Jian beats Dang Shuye Six to Zero, Six to One</p>
<p>Shen Meijian Beats Zhang Ji Zeng Six to Four, Six to One</p>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan beats Wang Minshi Seven to Five, Six to Two</p>
<p>Sun Chengbi beats Huang Jianyu Six to One, Six to Two</p>
<p>Chen Chuanzhang beats Mao Honggui Six to Three, Six to Two</p>

<h3 id="e114">Wang Jihuai Creates New National Record in Pentathlon <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>In the drizzling rain, the pentathlon competition began. There were few spectators outside the field, and there were more referees in the field than athletes. Therefore, compared with the previous day, the track and field had a feeling of past and present. Fortunately, the athletes who came to the field were all energetic and wanted to show their skills.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Pentathlon <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The pentathlon is a special event for Shanghai athletes. At last year's National Games, held in Hangzhou, the first and second places in the pentathlon were all won by Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday's pentathlon competition was expected to have good results. However, after the news that Wang Jihuai had injured his ribs in the long jump the day before yesterday, those who were enthusiastic about this event were unhappy and sighed that the pentathlon competition would be inferior because of it. Unexpectedly, to everyone's delight, when the reporter arrived at the field at about 1 PM yesterday afternoon, Wang Jihuai had already arrived before me. The reporter was deeply afraid of psychological effects, so he only encouraged him and did not mention any foot tendon sprains. The result of the competition was very satisfactory, and he actually created a new national record with a score of 2821.305 points, exceeding Chen Shengkui's score in the North China Games by more than 268 points. Yesterday's competition also involved the 10,000 meters, which reversed the order. After running the 200 meters, they ran the 1,500 meters without resting for even a quarter of an hour, so the results were slightly inferior. Otherwise, the total score would have been even more impressive. Hao Chunde, the pentathlon champion of last year's National Games, was inferior in the 1,500 meters and javelin, so he was ranked second. The complete scores of each person are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Decathlon <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Luo Chuanxian and Zhong Lianji Compete for the Championship</p>
<p>Cao Yu, the decathlon champion of last year's National Games, was injured in the back of his thigh due to excessive practice during the summer vacation. After two weeks of rest, he had fully recovered. Unexpectedly, his old injury recurred during the pole vault the day before yesterday, so he gave up yesterday's decathlon and pole vault. Therefore, yesterday's decathlon competition was not very exciting. Initially, there were seven participants. After the 100 meters and long jump, Li Lin and Jiang Shanjing also gave up halfway. Therefore, only Zhong Lianji, Luo Chuanxian, Liang Tiancheng, Liu Menglin, and Li Guowei completed the first half. Judging from the scores of the first five events, Zhong had a total of 2773.81 points, and seemed to have a better chance of winning the championship. However, Zhong's performance in the last five events was not as good as in the first five events. Luo Chuanxian may have a chance to catch up, because Luo can beat Zhong by a lot in the high hurdles, discus, and javelin. According to the reporter's speculation, the 1,500 meters is the focus of the competition between Zhong and Luo for the decathlon championship. Liang Tiancheng has a third hope, and Li Guowei's scores are too far apart, so he may be eliminated. What will happen? Let's listen to the analysis today. The scores of the first half of the decathlon are recorded below.</p>

<p>Time: 1 minute 36.7 seconds</p>
<p>At 7 PM last night, the city's best male and female swimmers gathered at the Jiaotong University swimming pool in Xujiahui, each showing their best skills and competing against each other, causing 600-700 spectators to watch from the sidelines, cheering and applauding thunderously. The new national record for the 100-meter backstroke was created by Wen Jingduo in this tense atmosphere. The progress of each event is briefly described below:</p>
<h3 id="e120">(1) General Comments on the Competition <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲ In the second group of the men's 50-meter freestyle, Lin Jiangshui's swimming posture was quite good. He was ranked second when he reached the finish line, but unfortunately, he swam out of his lane carelessly and was disqualified.</p>
<p>▲ Gong Xiji, who won the first place in the women's 50-meter freestyle, was tall and sturdy, with a masculine appearance. Her swimming posture was very graceful.</p>
<p>▲ The first place winners of the first and second groups in the men's 100-meter backstroke preliminary both used the method of stroking both arms backward at the same time, while the second place winners of the two groups both used the method of stroking one arm backward alternately. The spectators were all surprised. Yu Binqi, a backstroke expert, was disqualified for crossing the line while swimming. Otherwise, Yu would have won the second place and would have been promising in tomorrow's final.</p>
<p>▲ In the first group of the 1,500-meter preliminary, the first, second, and third places were about 50 meters apart, reaching the finish line in order, which was very interesting. In the second group, Chen Quantai had already swum 36 laps and was in second place, but suddenly had a stomachache, so he had to give up the competition, which was a pity.</p>
<p>▲ In the first group of the 200-meter breaststroke preliminary, Su Zuqing cramped in the pool when he was swimming enthusiastically, rising and falling. Other athletes by the pool saw the danger and bravely jumped into the pool in groups of three or five to rescue him. All the spectators applauded and celebrated.</p>
<p>▲ The competition in the second group of the men's 100-meter freestyle was extremely fierce. Yin Yanjun, the first place winner, and Chen Xiannan, the second place winner, were only inches apart when they reached the finish line.</p>
<p>▲ There was only one lady, Gong Xiji, in the women's 100-meter freestyle. The three Chen sisters were temporarily invited to join the performance. Ms. Chen Baoxuan, the oldest at 13 years old, led first when she swam to 25 meters, but was soon overtaken by Ms. Gong, resulting in second place. Ms. Chen Baodang, who was slightly younger than her sister, was also able to complete the entire course, which was quite difficult. The youngest, Ms. Chen Baolian, was only 9 years old, petite and exquisite, lively and extraordinary, with a graceful posture, and will definitely become a swimming expert in the future. The reporter can predict.</p>

<p>In the ten thousand meter run, judging by yesterday's final, one could say that talent was abundant. Thirty-one people started, and more than twenty finished the race. The distance between the top six was quite close. The intense competition was unprecedented in Shanghai's ten thousand meter races. Wang Zhenglin followed Ma Fengrui right from the start. For seven or eight laps, it was like a good car towing a broken car, lap after lap, a comical sight. After ten laps, Wang was no match for Ma, gradually falling behind, becoming out of reach, ending up twenty to thirty meters behind Ma. Xu Yanbo, Chen Xingpei, Dong Jiaxie, and Chen Luzhou, each panting like an ox, followed closely behind. In this situation, it was truly uncertain who would win. In the end, Ma was indeed Ma. When this "Ma" was mentioned, everyone looked up to his head and bowed at his hooves. Wang Zhenglin, Xu Yanbo, and Chen Xingpei fought to the very end, securing second, third, and fourth places, respectively. Chen Xuzhou is old and, as learned, had been ill for a long time, resulting in a decline in energy, which led to his failure to place. The other competitors were in good spirits. Few dropped out midway and failed to finish the entire course, which is truly a memorable event. Furthermore, not many were absent during the roll call, which shows the interest of the city's residents in long-distance running. However, observing all the competitors, many had poor form, taking steps that were too high and employing a jumping posture, which is a major flaw in long-distance running and should be improved in the future. The results of the ten thousand meter race are recorded below:</p>
<p>First Place: Ma Fengrui</p>
<p>Second Place: Wang Zhenglin</p>
<p>Third Place: Xu Yanbo</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Chen Xingpei</p>
<p>Time: 37 minutes, 16 and 5/5 seconds.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram Calling for Peace <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Whole Country Joins Forces to Relieve Disaster</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram yesterday, which said, "To the Nanjing National Government: Amidst the atmosphere of silence, ominous news is spreading at home and abroad, claiming that the situation in Hunan is tense. We are shocked to hear this. Ever since the initial dispute in Guangdong this year, our Chamber has sent telegrams calling for national wealth to be devoted to large-scale disaster relief and national forces to be devoted to large-scale bandit suppression. If war breaks out again, financial and military resources will be unable to handle both, and we will only be able to watch as our country falls into the hands of bandits and our people become starving refugees. Furthermore, under the rule of the party, all disputes should be properly handled in accordance with the party's constitution. If we resort to war, it would be self-destructive to the life of the party's rule and the life of the Chinese nation. Since then, although the dispute has not been properly resolved, the Guangdong side has repeatedly made informal declarations that it will not hinder the military operations of bandit suppression, even if it goes against public opinion. Therefore, for several months, the troops have not moved a single step beyond the Five Ridges. The people of the country believe that the Guangdong side also deeply understands the power of public opinion and the need to protect the lifeline of the nation, so there is a glimmer of hope for a peaceful future. Moreover, it is increasingly clear that the crux of the dispute is not that there is no way to resolve it except through military force. The previous storms and tense atmosphere were caused by those with ulterior motives who stirred up trouble, not the original intention. Unexpectedly, man-made disasters and natural disasters have come together. The military operation of bandit suppression has just begun to succeed, but floods have caused disasters in as many as seventeen provinces across the country. According to estimates, the number of people affected by the disaster is about fifty to sixty million, almost one-seventh of our country's total population. The tragedy is even worse than the great famine in the northwest last year. Moreover, the areas affected by this disaster are mostly in the areas of the country known as the financial and tax areas. The treasures have been swept away by the waves, and the situation is different from that of drought. Even if the entire country, from top to bottom, exhausts all its resources and makes a concerted effort to provide disaster relief, it is still feared that the disaster area is too large and the resources are too weak to raise the disaster-stricken people from the ravines. Therefore, the news of this disaster has spread, and donations have poured in from home and abroad, because it is a human constant to love life and hate killing. Our country's unprecedented disaster is enough to arouse their compassion and sympathy. As the saying goes, 'When the people are in mourning, crawl to save them.' At this time, more than half of the country's territory is in a disaster area, which is the day to crawl to save the mourning, not the time to compete for pride. According to the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Annals, war is a major taboo for mourning, because it takes advantage of people's danger for one's own benefit. How can we take advantage of the day when people across the country are starving to death to achieve our own goals? Wherever the army goes, the expenses are huge. In a melee, there is no way to have both. It is bound to rob everything to fill the military needs. It is expected that the day when the soldiers at the front come into contact will be the time when national relief is suspended, and tens of millions of disaster victims will die. The officials in power must have a heart of benevolence and will not bear to trap the people of the country in the realm of destruction due to a single mistake. Previously, I read Commander-in-Chief Chiang's letter to the people of the country and Deputy Commander Zhang's telegram, which also stated that the country's steps are difficult and the people's livelihood is haggard, and it is urgent to recuperate and rejuvenate, and there is no room for war again. Benevolent words and good news are admired by the whole world. I hope that the gentlemen will lay down their weapons and find other ways to deal with the aftermath, and keep in mind the warnings of danger and perish and do not fall into the criticism of leading the war. Not only can the disaster victims rely on it to entrust their lives, but the continuation of the national foundation lies in this. Sincerely calling out, I hope you will understand." Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Shanghai Business Community to Launch Peace and Disaster Relief Association <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Li Shizeng's Reply Telegram Agrees</p>
<p>Li Shizeng replied yesterday to Zhang Gongquan, Lin Kanghou, Ye Zhuotang, and others in a telegram, which said, "(Translated) To Mr. Lin Kanghou and Mr. Ye Zhuotang of the Shanghai Bankers' Association: I have just replied to Brother Zhang Gongquan in a telegram as follows: To Mr. Zhang Gongquan: I have received your letter. Our views on peace and disaster relief are the same. Recently, all sectors of Beijing have launched a Peace and Disaster Relief Association. I hope that you, Mr. Lin, and the comrades of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association will also proceed in a consistent manner as stated in your letter and in the spirit of the past peace movement to promote the early realization of peace. The people's livelihood of the whole country will really depend on it. Yuying bows. I also pray that you will all agree with this view. Yuying bows." After receiving the telegram, Zhang, Lin, Ye, and others held a meeting with Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others, and decided to convene a meeting in the next few days to advocate peace and request the Guangdong region to cease military operations.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Boy Scout Fundraising Completed Yesterday <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Totaling More Than Ten Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The results of the Shanghai Boy Scout fundraising were announced yesterday at the Moore Memorial Church. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Education Bureau, as well as the entire staff of the East Asia Boy Scouts, were present to supervise. From 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM, the work of sorting and auditing was completed. A total of more than ten thousand yuan was raised, which was still far from the association's original ideal, but the enthusiasm of the city's Boy Scouts was admirable. The results of yesterday's opening of the collection boxes were as follows: 2,199.3 yuan in silver dollars, 22,327.5 cents in small silver coins, and 59,585 copper coins. Combined with the results from the previous day, the total was 5,599.3 yuan in silver dollars, 52,329.5 cents in small silver coins, and 129,168 copper coins. After deducting 14.1 yuan in counterfeit silver dollars, 1487 cents in inferior coins, and 244.8 yuan for the printing of bamboo collection boxes and other expenses (all meal expenses, transportation expenses, and other expenses were borne by the Municipal Council), the net amount was 5,340.4 yuan in silver dollars, 50,842.5 cents in small silver coins, and 129,168 copper coins. The above amounts were certified to be correct by Zhu Jiarang, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wu Lai, the representative of the Municipal Government, and Wu Zengfu, the representative of the Municipal Education Bureau. They were immediately handed over to the Shanghai All-Provinces Flood Disaster Relief Association, which issued receipts for storage, transfer, and distribution to benefit the disaster victims.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Disaster Relief News from Various Provinces Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Disaster Victims Begin to Gather for Shelter</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day that the Shanghai Disaster Relief Office concentrated the disaster victims who came to Shanghai from various places at the first shelter on Liuying Road, Zhabei. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Transportation in Batches: After the staff members of the office gathered at the office yesterday morning, they set off separately. The China Moving Company allocated four cars for transportation. The north and south were far apart, and it took time to travel back and forth. The cars made fifteen trips in the morning to transport the disaster victims from the Chaozhou Wuyi Villa. In the afternoon, they transported the disaster victims from the Yongxi Hall Zhejiang Shaoxing Association. If time allowed, the disaster victims from the Qu Zhenren Temple would also be transported together. However, the disaster victims from the Chao Hui Villa would have to be transported today.</p>
<p>▲Equipment Inside the Shelter: Yesterday the weather was uncertain due to rain, so the Kangding reorganization plan of the office could not be implemented. Only the number of disaster victims was counted according to the points. If it was confirmed that a family had twelve or thirteen members, they would live in one room. Approximately ten to twelve people lived in each room. Each room was 25 feet long and 10 feet wide. The beds were paved with 2-inch thick wooden boards, more than 2 feet above the ground, with shelves placed on top and coal ash paved underneath. There were paths made of mud bricks, and there were corridors along the corridors with benches. When the disaster victims from Chaozhou Wuyi Villa first moved in, although they had been informed in advance, many disaster victims were still doubtful, and some even cried and refused to get in the car. After the staff persuaded them, they followed them. When they arrived at the shelter, they were all overjoyed to see where they lived, and some even cried for joy. However, the shelter had not yet distributed the clothing for the disaster victims to use at this time.</p>
<p>▲Injections and Vaccinations: All disaster victims transported to the first shelter on Liuying Road by car must first be injected with a vaccination and vaccinated against smallpox by the technicians sent by the health team of the office. Then, the staff of the office could assign them housing, lead them inside, and immediately provide them with food. Each meal consisted of one vegetarian dish and one soup, which was very clean. The dishes eaten by the staff members were also the same as those of the disaster victims. It was also learned that after all the disaster victims were concentrated, barbers would be hired to the shelter to shave their long hair in batches and have them take a bath to maintain cleanliness.</p>
<p>▲Telegram Not to Send More: The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs received a telegram from the Hubei Civil Affairs Department yesterday, stating that 20,000 disaster victims would be transported to Shanghai in batches and asked if they could be accommodated. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs responded that there were already many disaster victims coming to Shanghai from various provinces, the supplies were huge, and the equipment was not easy to obtain, so they telegraphed the Hubei Civil Affairs Department not to transport disaster victims to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Yesterday, Cantonese Compatriots from the Hankou Disaster Area Arrived in Shanghai <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Guangzhao Association and the Cantonese Overseas Chinese Business Federation had previously purchased a large amount of grain and medicine to send people to Hankou for emergency relief due to the severe flood disaster in Hankou. Yesterday morning, the Huangpu steamship carried the first batch of 78 Cantonese compatriots, men, women, and children, from the Hankou disaster area. When they arrived at the pier, the directors of the association, Chen Bingqian, together with the staff, personally supervised the care and sent them to the predetermined Mingli Guangtailai Hotel for accommodation. In the afternoon, they took Dr. Huang Wen and others to the hotel to give injections for dysentery. They will be sent back to their hometowns another day.</p>

<h3 id="e140">News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>▲Progress Report: Since its establishment on the 18th of last month, the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association has been working with extraordinary intensity. All trivial news has been published daily. Now, in order to allow philanthropists to understand the association's progress, we have specially copied a letter from the association to the Provincial Relief Committee and present it below. Respectfully, the province of Jiangsu is unfortunate, with floods raging. Over fifty counties have reported disasters, and the most and second-most severely affected number nearly thirty. The disaster area is vast, unprecedented in history. Our colleagues are heartbroken and alarmed. We have undertaken the task entrusted by the general assembly to organize the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association to engage in relief efforts. We are also grateful for the allocation of one million yuan in public bonds as security, which will be managed together. This demonstrates the utmost concern for the disaster-stricken people, and we are filled with admiration. It is understood that official relief and charitable relief share the same ultimate goal. When people are drowning and starving, how dare we lag behind? At the beginning of our planning, we took the division of disaster areas and on-site surveys as our starting point. We divided the areas into the Ningxu area, led by Commissioner Qiao Baoyuan; the Yangzhen area, led by Commissioner Yuan Jimei; and the Zhunyang area, led by Commissioner Zhu Qiliu and Commissioner Chen Huichen. We also printed survey forms to be filled out separately. We also compiled a general organizational outline and two detailed rules for handling affairs and distributing aid, as our relief guidelines. After deliberation, a basic framework has been established. In the midst of these preparations, news came of the breach of the Gao-Shao Canal, causing immense suffering. Jing Sheng, having been mistakenly elected by his colleagues, brought cash and dry rations, and rushed to Zhen overnight. He met with Mr. Leng, Mr. Lu, Mr. Hu, Mr. Wang, and other gentlemen, as well as gentlemen from the general assembly, at the Chamber of Commerce to discuss emergency relief methods. A provincial office was immediately established in cooperation with the Jiangbei Flood Relief Association. Several steamships and civilian boats were dispatched in teams to provide assistance. Chairman Ye was also accompanied to the Gao-Shao-Baoying area for on-site surveys. The sight of the dead drifting and the living crying for help was heartbreaking. Consequently, offices were established in various counties and towns along the canal, including Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Sisui, Baoying, and Xinghua, with the primary task of establishing shelters to provide settlement for the survivors of this catastrophe. Currently, six shelters have been established in Yangzhou, three in Zhenjiang, four in Gaoyou, one in Jieshou, one in Sisui, and two in Baoying, accommodating over 20,000 people. However, some of these people have moved on to relatives and friends. If we include the number of people who have been transported, the total is estimated to be between 40,000 and 50,000. The rules for the offices and shelters, as well as the transportation methods, have been carefully established amidst busy schedules. We have been tirelessly planning and working day and night. After completing the survey and returning to Shanghai, we received a letter assigning the emergency relief of twenty-two counties, including Pixiao, to our association, along with the entire province's winter relief for this year. After reading this, our colleagues felt that with the area divided and the scope smaller, both personnel and funds would be easier to manage. This arrangement aligns with our initial intentions. However, the counties assigned this time, such as Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Xinghua, Baoying, Jiangpu, Gangshan, Funing, Huaian, and Huaiyin, are all the most severely affected areas. In addition to the undammed breach of the Gao-Shao Canal, the counties in the lower reaches of the river are still completely flooded. People are displaced, and there is no intact land. The suffering is unprecedented in human history and rarely seen in a century. We pace around the room, our minds exhausted. We have already hired experienced and reputable individuals who have been involved in relief work for many years to serve as directors of investigations and distributions in each county. We have also allocated funds from the general assembly to be transferred to them for investigations and distributions. If there are insufficient funds for any county, we will use charitable relief as a backup. In terms of investigation and distribution procedures, in addition to the offices managing shelters and porridge kitchens, and hiring boats and purchasing relief supplies, which can only be calculated based on receipts, for provincial funds, we still intend to uniformly use relief vouchers. This is to emphasize the seriousness of relief funds amidst the urgency of emergency relief. (Abbreviated below)</p>
<p>▲Telegraphic Excerpts: The association has been receiving dozens of telegrams daily from various parties regarding relief efforts, etc. We have selected a few telegrams below. Governor Zhang's telegram to Jiang: "Respectfully reading your telegram, I am deeply honored. I, Jiang, as the Director of Pacification, am responsible for comforting the people. Witnessing the suffering, I feel deeply indebted. Your concern for the hungry and drowning, and your enthusiasm for saving the world, have inspired all who hear of it. Although I am unworthy, I will follow in your footsteps and do my best to assist in saving these disaster-stricken people." Also, Commissioner Chen Huichen's telegram from the Baoying Office: "The Jiangbei Emergency Relief Association has received 500 bags of flour. Director Hu of the Civil Affairs Department visited Bao and surveyed the disaster on the first day of the new year, deeming it extremely severe. He also inspected two shelters." Also, Director Hu of Zhenjiang's telegram to Commissioner Wang Yiting: "A meeting is scheduled to be held on [date]. Please come with Commissioner Cheng. I heard that Commissioner Wang is busy with relief efforts and will only be able to attend the meeting in Zhen on [date]."</p>
<h3 id="e141">Work of the China International Famine Relief Commission in Disaster Relief <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>▲Yangzhou Branch Begins Distribution: The association received a letter from the Yangzhou branch reporting the following: (1) The main relief item is flour. Please have the headquarters in Shanghai purchase it. (1) The main relief item is flour. Please have the headquarters in Shanghai purchase it. (2) The distribution team has already departed, focusing on poor and remote areas that have been overlooked by various charitable groups. (3) The upper, middle, and lower reaches of the three rivers have all suffered catastrophic damage. There are over 1.1 million disaster victims, half of whom are extremely poor. With winter approaching, please prepare more cotton clothes and pants.</p>
<p>▲Flour and Old Clothes Transported to Yangzhou: After receiving the above report, the association has purchased 10,000 bags of flour, with 5,000 bags being loaded onto the Datong Steamer today and another 5,000 bags to be loaded tomorrow. The association has also transported several hundred pieces of used clothing to the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce for transfer to Yangzhou.</p>
<p>▲Establishment of the Xinghua Branch: The Xinghua branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission has been officially established. Reverend Ke Weilian is the Western president, and Commissioner Hua Zhen is the Chinese president. The members are Hong Yixin, Yan Lunan, Gu Zifang, Zhu Liangfu, Xi Dingjue, Rong Yuzhi, Wu Xinhua, etc., who have divided into groups to carry out their work.</p>
<p>▲Hu Wenhu Donates More Wan Jin You: Mr. Hu Wenhu, owner of the Tiger Balm Yong An Tang in Singapore, is enthusiastic about philanthropy. He has repeatedly donated large sums of money and medicines. Yesterday, he telegraphed the association, donating another 26 boxes of Wan Jin You. A philanthropist like Mr. Hu is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>▲Hangzhou Used Clothing and Bedding Relief Association: As the weather is getting colder, the disaster victims are suffering from both hunger and cold. In addition to food, there is an urgent need for clothing and bedding. Philanthropists in Hangzhou have organized the Used Clothing and Bedding Relief Association to donate used clothing and bedding to benefit the disaster victims. Yesterday, 453 items were sent to the association, which plans to transport them to the disaster area for distribution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲Chen Fang's Photo Frame Stall Raises Funds: Chen Fang, the owner of the Chen Fang photo frame stall at Dongxin Bridge on Avenue Edward VII, considering the severity of the floods in various places, believes that even as a small business owner, he should do what he can to help those in need. He has enthusiastically solicited donations from nearby vendors, etc. In addition to Chen Fang's own donation of five yuan, some donated two yuan, some donated one yuan, and many donated two jiao. A total of 78 households donated 37.5 yuan in silver dollars and 68 jiao in small coins. This was delivered to the China International Famine Relief Commission yesterday for forwarding to the disaster area. A small business owner with such enthusiasm is truly admirable.</p>
<p>▲Dongtai Welcomes the Transport Team to Open the Seaport: The Dongtai Association in Shanghai recently received a report from Dongtai stating that the Yanken Company is obstructing the drainage of water. It states that the Dafeng and Yuhua Companies are located downstream of the Caozhen Gate diversion canal, near the end of the Doulong Port. Before the company was established, it was all Cao marshland. In the past, when the Huai River flooded, the dikes of the Yun Canal were opened to release water into the sea, but not all of it was discharged through the Doulong Port. Because of the nearby Cao marshland, there were branch rivers and small ports above, which diverted water into the sea. Since the establishment of the company, it has built high dikes inside and outside the reclamation area, preventing the drainage of water from the nine counties in the lower reaches of the river. During the great flood, the counties observed this situation, and the provincial councilors of Taizhou requested the opening of the dikes, which was approved. This summer, with continuous rain for weeks, there was no way to drain the water. The local people also believed that the dams of Dafeng and Yuhua were obstructing the flow. This was recognized by representatives from various counties and approved by the Second Jiangsu Provincial Representative Conference. The provincial government ordered the Dongtai County to supervise the opening of the company's seaports. In late August, the county dispatched the director of the Public Security Bureau to open the Nan Zhong and Liang Mao You Rivers first. Unexpectedly, the company re-blocked the mouths of the various Mao You Rivers shortly after the opening personnel left. Their intention is not only to disregard the provincial orders but also to trap the people of the nine counties in the lower reaches of the river to death. A telegram has been received from the provincial government requesting Pacification Commissioner Zhang and Security Director Li Chuliang to send a team to Dongtai to open the seaports of various companies. The people are extremely grateful, believing that the accumulated water can quickly enter the sea, saving them from drowning. Posters have been put up all over the county seat to welcome the opening of the army. If they can arrive a day earlier, millions of lives can be saved.</p>
<p>▲Bao Ying Representative Hu Yuzhang Comes to Shanghai to Beg for Relief: The Bao Ying Relief Association in the province, considering the severity of the flood in the county this year, with the countryside completely flooded and the fields turned into lakes, with countless deaths and losses, finds it difficult to describe the various tragic situations. Recently, affected by the breach of the Gaoyou-Shaobo dike, the floodwaters have suddenly increased by more than ten feet. The city has long been flooded, and there is no autumn harvest. The disaster situation is even worse than before. In addition to appeals from the association in Zhenjiang to various parties, Hu Yuzhang was specially sent to Shanghai yesterday to contact Cheng Jingsheng, Lu Shao Liu, Sun Shengzeng, Zhu Jinxun, Liu Tieleng, Mao Qi, Zhu Weiyao, Xu Xiyu, and other fellow villagers in Shanghai to discuss the county's relief efforts and promote the organization of the Bao Ying Flood Relief Association in Shanghai. It is reported that Mr. Hu is currently staying at No. 18 Yuanyuan Hotel on Ermalu Street and plans to go to the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association and other charitable organizations today to fully describe the severity of the flood in the county and plead for more relief.</p>

<h3 id="e146">The 20th Anniversary of the Ta Lu Pao <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>A New Atmosphere After the Return of the Chinese</p>
<p>A Huge Commemorative Special Issue is Published</p>
<p>Shanghai, by virtue of its commercial, political, historical, and geographical relationships, is the center of the domestic news industry. In recent years, the press has undergone many changes, and the most noteworthy of these is the acquisition of the Ta Lu Pao by the Chinese.</p>
<p>Shanghai has three English morning newspapers that are equally famous. The Ta Lu Pao is one of them. The Ta Lu Pao was founded in 1911, exactly 20 years ago. At that time, the revolutionary tide was surging, and the international atmosphere was somewhat anxious. President Sun, Mr. Wu Tingfang, Mr. Tang Shaoyi, etc., pooled funds and entrusted Mr. Miller, an American, to run the newspaper to correct international perceptions. This was the beginning of the Ta Lu Pao. Later, the world changed, and President Sun and others had no time to take care of it, so it fell into American hands. The hosts were repeatedly replaced, but because it was registered in the United States, everyone knew that it was an organ of the Americans. Last October, it was acquired by people from the Chinese press. Since then, the Ta Lu Pao has become the only English Chinese newspaper in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Since October, the Ta Lu Pao has made considerable progress. This is because the managers are experts in the field (the chief editor is Mr. Dong Xianguang, who has long been respected in the press and who founded the Tianjin Yong Bao), and the approach to material is in line with its nature and position. There are two obvious aspects: (1) In terms of business, sales and advertising have both increased sharply. Sales have increased by more than double, and advertising has increased by one-third. (2) In terms of editing, in addition to continuing to pay attention to international news, Sino-foreign trade, literature and art, technology, and film, in order to maintain its original foreign readers and the face of an English newspaper, it has made every effort to seek detailed and accurate information on Chinese political news, social problems, construction plans, and the opinions of Chinese businessmen. (It is also able to disclose Chinese news one day earlier than foreign newspapers.) It has corrected the flaws of foreign newspapers that are sensational, superficial, and biased. Although its attitude in its commentary is completely based on the interests of China, it has been able to express the spirit of advocating fairness because it has tried to avoid narrowness and to be sincere. These few things meet the practical needs of foreigners, because most legitimate foreigners are in China to engage in industry and commerce, so what they seek to know is the truth and true intentions of China, and they are not happy to hear rumors and strange theories that are unfavorable to China. Therefore, in the past, the Ta Lu Pao, because of its national relationship, was best able to absorb American expatriates as readers, but after the reorganization, it has been universally noticed and trusted by expatriate merchants from various countries and their home countries. This is the main reason for the success of the past October.</p>
<p>After the Chinese obtained this Ta Lu Pao, of course, they regarded external publicity for the country as their duty, and the Chinese business community in Shanghai has gradually understood the necessity of a mouthpiece for the outside world, so they have been able to make considerable use of the Ta Lu Pao and regard it as a medium for promoting Sino-foreign trade. Usually, they pay close attention to the Ta Lu Pao, and when necessary, they use the Ta Lu Pao's advertisements and chronicles to avoid harm and seek benefits, and to promote their business. The Ta Lu Pao has benefited greatly from these circumstances, which is due to its efforts and not to chance. It is reported that the Ta Lu Pao is now planning a vigorous advancement plan, aiming to fulfill its foreign mission to the Chinese government and the public, that is, to make practical contributions in the political, diplomatic, economic, commercial, and even cultural and artistic fields.</p>
<p>August 29th of this year is the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Ta Lu Pao, and a special issue of 100 large pages will be published on September 15th. Chairman Chiang, Vice Commander Zhang, Foreign Minister Wang, Industry Minister Kong, Transportation Minister Wang, Railway Minister Lian, Health Minister Liu, Shanghai Mayor Zhang, Foreign Ministry Information Department Chief Diao, China Bank Mr. Zhang Gongquan, Zhejiang Industrial Bank Mr. Li Xinsun, Chinese press celebrities Shi Liangcai, Zhang Zhuping, Pan Gongbi, Wang Yingbin, Ge Gongzhen, Wang Boqi, Lin Zhenbin, and other gentlemen, and other Chinese and foreign celebrities, either wrote congratulatory messages or contributed their great works, which are dazzling and beautiful. Chairman Chiang said that the Ta Lu Pao was founded at the same time as the Republic of China and has a history of 20 years. In his congratulatory message, he paid special attention to it. The essays by Chinese and foreign celebrities are mostly about China's new construction in the past 20 years, and none of them are worthless. Their value is self-evident. It is reported that a total of 30,000 copies of the special issue will be printed and distributed all over the world. This kind of commemoration is a new record for Western newspapers in Shanghai. The colleagues of the Ta Lu Pao have been preparing for this event for several months, so it is appropriate that they have achieved this result.</p>
<p>In addition to publishing a special issue to commemorate its 20th anniversary, the Ta Lu Pao has also formulated preferential measures for subscribers in order to popularize it. Ordinary subscribers can receive a 20% discount on the annual price of 24 yuan, and student subscribers will receive even more preferential treatment. The annual special price of 18 yuan can be further discounted by 5%. This is a great opportunity for Chinese people to read English newspapers. Do not neglect it. The staff serving at the Ta Lu Pao are of seven nationalities, namely Chinese, English, American, French, Portuguese, Japanese, and Korean. Moreover, there are not only men, but also many women. This shows the breadth of its talent recruitment, which is not limited by national boundaries and cannot be achieved by other newspapers. (September 14)</p>

<p>Pu Wenting Arrives in Shanghai from Wuxi</p>
<p>Playing Mahjong at the Qi Family's Residence</p>
<p>Three Kidnappers Arrive for a "Visit"</p>
<p>After Meeting, They Forcibly Abduct Him</p>
<p>At approximately 8:00 p.m. last night, a bizarre kidnapping occurred in Simingli, Foch Road, in the French Concession. The criminals boldly entered the house and openly abducted the victim, setting a new record in Shanghai's kidnapping cases. This further demonstrates the rampant nature of kidnappers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ A woman surnamed Wang rented a house in the French Concession, west of Foch Road, in a lane called Chenghecun. Recently, due to a change of residence and employment at the Siming Bank, a new-style building was rebuilt, and the lane was renamed Simingli. Two weeks ago, a woman claiming to be Wang rented a shikumen house at No. 19 in the lane. Wang herself occupied the ground floor, while the second floor was sublet to another woman who also happened to be surnamed Wang.</p>
<p>▲ Accompanying Guest Plays Mahjong The day before yesterday (the 12th), a relative from Wuxi named Pu Wenting came to Wang's house. Pu, 58 years old, worked at the Fuxin Flour Mill in Wuxi. After arriving in Shanghai, he stayed at Wang's residence. Yesterday afternoon, Wang and the Wang woman from upstairs invited two acquaintances, young ladies, to accompany Pu in playing mahjong for entertainment. Unexpectedly, a sudden incident occurred around 8:00 p.m.</p>
<p>▲ Three Men Visit Mr. Pu As Pu and the three women were deeply engrossed in their mahjong game, Fan Ma, a female servant at Wang's house, was preparing dinner in the kitchen. Suddenly, she heard someone knocking on the back door with their fingers. When the servant asked who it was, a voice outside the door replied, "Visiting Mr. Pu." The servant opened the door and saw three men wearing long gowns, entering in single file, with a calm demeanor, resembling ruffians. The servant told the guests to wait a moment and stretched her neck to call for Mr. Pu upstairs.</p>
<p>▲ Two Men Approach the Stairs As the three men entered, the servant asked them why they were visiting Mr. Pu. One of them replied that they were in the flour business and had a business matter to discuss. The servant, seeing them as Pu's friends, told them to wait downstairs while she called Pu down. At this time, two of the men approached both sides of the stairs. One of them pulled his clothes and sat down on the long bench near the back door, waiting for the arrival of their "god of wealth."</p>
<p>▲ Pistols Appear Simultaneously Upon hearing the call, Pu did not hesitate and immediately got up, taking large steps downstairs and repeatedly asking, "Who is it?" As Pu stepped down to the lowest step, two men suddenly emerged, blocking the stairs. When Pu turned around to get a good look, two black and shiny pistols were already pressed against his left and right waist, as if bodyguards were escorting a high-ranking official. They surged out of the back door.</p>
<p>▲ Driven Away in a Car At the same time, the man sitting on the bench, witnessing the victim being captured, rushed out the back door, jumped into a car, and started the engine. In an instant, the two men had forced Pu into the car. With a "whirring" sound, the car sped out of the lane towards the east. At this time, Fan the servant woke up as if from a dream and reported the incident upstairs. The three women were extremely shocked upon hearing the news. When they rushed to the entrance of the lane to report to the Chinese constable guarding the entrance, the kidnappers were already long gone.</p>
<p>▲ The Woman's Evasive Answers The police station was also notified at the same time, and detectives went to investigate. Reporters from this newspaper also arrived one after another. According to the Wang woman, the sublessor, her husband's name is Wang Junlai. When asked what his current occupation was, she looked embarrassed, and after hesitating for a long time, replied that he (referring to her husband) had not returned for several years. He had once worked in the military. "Gentlemen (referring to the reporters), just write whatever you want," she said, with an uneasy and flustered attitude and an unusually vague tone.</p>
<p>▲ Rumors Among Passersby A reporter also privately inquired with people in the same building. It was reported that the woman upstairs was actually Pu's concubine, and the so-called sublessor, Mrs. Wang, was also very intimate with Pu. The secrets within were not something that outsiders could understand even a fraction of. As for the car used by the kidnappers, it was waiting directly behind No. 19, about dozens of yards away from the entrance of the lane. Since there were many residents in the lane who owned or hired cars, the Chinese constable guarding the entrance did not pay much attention. It was truly unexpected that the kidnappers would dare to openly drive a car into the lane and enter the house to abduct the victim. According to one or two passersby, they had indeed seen a car speeding out of the lane a moment ago. It was a black-plated private car. The sublessor, Mrs. Wang, has urgently telegraphed Pu's eldest son, Pu Yongda, in Wuxi, to come to Shanghai immediately to take charge of the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Two Tides in Shanghai in One Day <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Huangpu River Tides Overflowing the Banks</p>
<p>Since this summer and autumn, the tides have risen greatly, causing severe flooding in various provinces, with waters not receding for several days or even weeks. The severity of the disasters is unprecedented. However, the tides in Shanghai recently have undergone special changes, with two tides occurring in one day, which can also be described as a new unprecedented record. Due to rumors of the tide landing on the 25th of last month, causing public anxiety, the maximum height of the recent high tides is also a matter of great concern to the general public. According to staff at the Wusong Fort Taiwan Cheqi (flag station), the tide rises and falls twice every day and night, which is known to everyone. However, the recent oddity of the tides is unprecedented. According to their work experience, whenever the tide first rises, the rising water (i.e., the bamboo-made black ball) is hoisted to indicate navigation to ships. Traditionally, it takes four hours from the time the ball is hoisted for the tide to recede. Unexpectedly, recently, there have been instances where the tide receded in only three hours, and even more so where the tide rose again before the water had fallen for two hours. This kind of unusual situation has occurred several times at the end of last month and the beginning of this month. The unpredictable tides are dangerous for sailing ships, and they also affect the accuracy of reports on the work and accounting records of the staff, causing great difficulties in their duties. However, the tides of the previous two days (i.e., the first day of the lunar calendar) were not high. The second day was slightly higher, with the daytime tide rising to 38 feet and the nighttime tide being five inches higher. Yesterday (i.e., the third day), the daytime tide was 38 feet 1 inch, and it is feared that the nighttime tide will be higher. Because the previous day was a strong southerly wind blowing eastward, yesterday morning the south wind turned westward, and in the afternoon it turned into a northeast wind, but it was not strong. Therefore, although the nighttime tide is predicted to be large, it is not expected to exceed 40 feet, and there should be no danger.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., when the tide came in, the force was very strong, causing the Huangpu River to be unable to hold the volume of water, overflowing the banks. The Bund Park and areas along the Huangpu River bank, South Sichuan Road, and Fuzhou Road were flooded with about six inches of water due to the low terrain. Some ignorant and foolish people passing by mistakenly believed that Shanghai would become a second Hankou, and were in a state of panic. The tide receded after about an hour.</p>

<p>They Encountered Patrol Detectives</p>
<p>Only One of the Three Robbers Escaped</p>
<p>Chen Shimin, 25 years old, a native of Nanjing and an employee of the Datong Apartment on Avenue Foch, lived in the Yongyuli at the intersection of Rue Belles and Ximen Road. At 3:15 a.m. yesterday morning, he finished his work and was riding home in a rickshaw. While traveling along Rue Belles near the intersection of Rue Vouillemont, three robbers suddenly rushed out, blocked the road, and threatened him with a fake pistol. They robbed him of a gold watch and a wallet containing 13 yuan. The robbers fled north with their loot. The victim, Chen Shimin, chased after them, shouting for help. One robber fled into the Fuzhifang on Rue Belles. Detectives and inspectors of a special squad, Jin Jiulin, detective Li Yaolong, assistant detectives Xu Yumin, Mao Jingen, and Zhang Ziying, and Chinese constable No. 648 and Vietnamese constable No. 309, who were on patrol, heard the cries and rushed to the scene. They captured one of the robbers and confiscated the iron fake pistol and the original stolen wallet, and took him to the police station. Another robber fled to the intersection of Rue Belles and Avenue Dubail and was spotted by Vietnamese constable No. 141, who ordered him to stop. When he refused to listen, the constable drew his gun and fired, hitting him in the chest. He fell to the ground and died instantly. The other robber escaped without a trace. According to the captured robber, his name is Jiang Renyong, 29 years old, a native of Tongzhou. The robber who escaped is named Xiao San, and the robber who was shot dead is named Si Lunzi, around 30 years old, a native of Tongzhou. He confessed to committing the robbery with the others. The police chief ordered that he be detained. Detectives were sent to take the robber's body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for examination. At 10:00 a.m., the police station reported the incident to the court for investigation. Judge Luo Renji and Prosecutor Lou Kongxian took their seats in the criminal court for interrogation. The victim described the robbery. When questioned, Jiang confessed to committing the robbery with Xiao San and Si Lunzi, who was shot dead. Because Vietnamese constable No. 141 was required to testify at the examination of the body and had not yet arrived, Judge Luo ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and scheduled a continued interrogation. Later, at 10:30 a.m., Prosecutor Ding Shikui, along with clerk Peng, medical examiner Hun Ligong, arrived at the site. After examining the robber's body, they took their seats and heard the police's report on the incident. They also stated that the body had no family members. Vietnamese constable No. 141, Jin Huangfang (transliteration), stated that he heard the cries of a robber, ordered him to stop, and fired his gun, resulting in his death. After verifying the testimony, Ding ruled that the deceased, Si Lunzi, died from gunshot wounds sustained during his life. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for storage.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Japanese Fishing Boat Republic Maru Capsized in Hurricane <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Only One Sailor Was Rescued</p>
<p>The Japanese Nagasaki Minamimatsuho fishing boat Republic Maru intended to fish in Chinese waters, but shortly after setting sail, it was overturned by a hurricane, drowning eleven people. Yesterday, the Japanese ship Ikoma Maru rescued a Japanese man named Fujiya, who described his experience of drifting at sea and sinking to the bottom of the sea twice. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Encountered a Large Storm The Nippon Yusen Kaisha's Ikoma Maru set sail from Moji on the afternoon of the 11th and arrived near the Tsushima Strait the next morning. A large storm occurred, with a hurricane and raging waves coming from the southeast. Fortunately, the shipowner Iwashita struggled to bring the ship closer to the strait, avoiding disaster. It was originally scheduled to arrive on the 13th, but it was delayed until yesterday. The passengers on board were all greatly frightened.</p>
<p>▲ The Republic Fishing Boat Was Destroyed and Sunk The fishing boat Republic Maru, carrying twelve sailors, departed from Nagazaki on the 10th. At 11:00 p.m. that night, seventy nautical miles outside Nagasaki, it encountered a large storm. The fishing boat was unable to avoid it. The first large wave struck, sweeping six fishermen and sailors overboard. As they were about to throw life buoys to rescue them, the first large wave came again. The ship was broken by a wave and immediately sank. The six people who remained on board also fell into the sea.</p>
<p>▲ Only One Passenger Survived After the twelve people on board fell into the sea, they were all separated. As the storm continued, the waves scattered the sailors, such as Zhang Yuanying, Lin Liangjie, Shimoda Akira, Ito, and others, were never seen again. Even their bodies were not found. It is thought that they all drowned. The chief sailor Fujiya, after falling into the sea, was washed to the bottom of the sea by a large wave. Fortunately, he knew how to swim and managed to resurface, but he sank to the bottom of the sea again. After resurfacing again, he managed to grab a piece of broken wood from the ship, only four feet long. Fujiya held on tightly and allowed it to drift with the waves for ten hours.</p>
<p>▲ Rescued and Brought to Shanghai The Japanese man was floating up and down and drifted to the vicinity of Tsushima Island at 8:23 a.m. on the 12th. Fujiya thought he was certain to die. At this time, the wind subsided slightly. He looked up and saw the Ikoma Maru ship sheltering from the wind. Fujiya shouted for help, which was heard by the crew of the Ikoma Maru. The shipowner Iwashita ordered a lifeboat to be lowered into the sea to rescue him. However, the lifeboat was broken by the waves as soon as it entered the sea. They then threw a life preserver into the sea and managed to rescue the Japanese man. After boarding the ship, they changed his wet clothes and gave him food and drink, and brought him to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Handed Over to the Consulate Yesterday, the Ikoma Maru arrived in Shanghai, and Fujiya also came to Shanghai. According to him, he floated in the sea for ten hours, with nine deaths and one survival. The other eleven people on board had already drowned. Yesterday, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha sent Fujiya to the Japanese Consulate in this city, and then the Japanese Consulate sent the Japanese man back to his country.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Tragic Incident of Robbers Killing a Child on the Station Branch Road <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>An Old Woman Upstairs Shouted</p>
<p>The Robbers Fired in Anger</p>
<p>The Bullet Pierced the Girl's Front and Back of the Head</p>
<p>The Mother, Mrs. Kong Zhang, Was Shot in the Arm</p>
<p>Kong Xueyuan, a locomotive driver on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Southern Railway Station, lived at No. 109 Station Branch Road and had some savings, which attracted the attention of robbers. Around 7:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (13th), Kong was having tea at a tiger stove across the street. Unexpectedly, two robbers wearing black raincoats and rain hats entered the house and asked Kong's wife, Mrs. Kong Zhang, if Old Kong was at home. Mrs. Kong, holding her two-year-old daughter, Mao Tou, walked out of the room and said that her husband was at the tiger stove across the street and that she would go call him. The robbers said that was not necessary, and told her to quickly hand over her money. As they spoke, they took out a gun. Mrs. Kong said that there was no money at home, and even if they pawned their clothes, they would not be worth the demand. While they were threatening her, Kong's nine-year-old child saw this and started crying loudly, running outside. The robbers saw this and dragged the child inside. The robbers, seeing that things had gone wrong, were about to leave when an old woman living upstairs shouted at Mrs. Kong to quickly call Kong Xuegui from outside. The robbers became angry and in a moment of desperation fired the gun. The bullet struck the two-year-old child Mao Tou's head, entering from the front of the head and exiting from the back. The force of the bullet was so great that after passing through, it also struck Mrs. Kong Zhang's right arm. Mother and daughter were both injured and fell to the ground. The robbers then fled in a panic. After Kong Xuegui learned of this, he rushed home and saw his wife and daughter lying in a pool of blood. He immediately sent them to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The police station of the Second District Police Department was nearby. By the time the police arrived, the robbers were long gone. After questioning those involved and reporting to the Second District, which then reported to the Public Security Bureau for investigation, Mrs. Kong Zhang and Kong Mao Tou were sent to the hospital. Mrs. Kong Zhang's injuries were not life-threatening, but Mao Tou died from her brain injury at 4:00 a.m. yesterday. Her body was brought home by Kong and reported to the police station, which ordered Zhang Hongxun, the local head of the twelfth tu of the fang, to report to the local court. Prosecutor Wu Shixin, along with clerk Qian Yinpei and inspector Xuan Zhiming, arrived at the scene to examine the body, confirming that she died from the injury. They ordered the body to be prepared for burial. They then went to the Shanghai Hospital to examine Mrs. Kong Zhang's injuries and filled out an autopsy report, ordering the arrest of the murderers.</p>
<h3 id="e163">A Major Gambling Den Was Raided in the French Concession <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>More Than a Dozen Places Were Raided</p>
<p>Favalier Personally Led the Raid</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, French Concession Director Favalier personally led detectives to raid more than a dozen gambling dens on Saturday morning. These included roulette dens and various foreign gambling dens. One was at No. 648 Avenue Foch, which was reportedly raided by Favalier himself. Another was at No. 195 Route Haig, where three roulette tables were found. It is said that many foreigners gathered there to gamble, with significant wins and losses. One was the International General Association at No. 500 Avenue des Soeurs. Another was the Business Association at No. 100 Rue des Sœurs. It is said that many poor Russians gathered there to gamble. It was initially called the Polish Business Association, but after the Polish Consul discovered that it was solely engaged in gambling, he protested to the French Concession authorities, and it was closed down. It was then renamed the Business Association. The above four places were among the more prominent ones.</p>

<p>Signing Dud Checks</p>
<p>Using the Goods to Obtain Money</p>
<p>According to the Ta Mei Wan Pao (Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury), an Englishman named Lushton, posing as an employee of a life insurance company, purchased two cigar boxes and a pair of cufflink chains worth 109 yuan on credit from the Hongchang Company on Nanjing Road. He signed two vouchers promising to pay the amount at a later date. He then pawned the goods and used the money. When the payment was not made, Hongchang sued the police station, requesting the British Police Court to issue a warrant for his arrest. The goods were recovered from a pawnshop. He was brought to the British Public Concession Court for trial today (14th). The defendant admitted to posing as an employee of an insurance company, but denied defrauding for the goods. The Western detective who arrested Lushton and a representative from Hongchang testified to everything. Because another witness had not yet arrived, the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e165">August Consumption and Value of Aquatic Products in This City <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Published by the Municipal Fisheries Guidance Institute</p>
<p>August is the typhoon season. Most Chinese fishing boats, both old and new, take this opportunity to repair their vessels, which is called the "slack fishing" period. Therefore, the catch is very small. On the one hand, the weather is hot, and many people abstain from meat, causing the market to be sluggish. According to statistics, this month the city consumed a total of 23,582 "dan" of fresh and frozen fish (excluding 7,530 "dan" of freshwater fish), worth 437,263 yuan. The marine products category amounted to 53,914 "dan", worth 711,529 yuan, more than double that of fresh fish. In addition, various salted fish, refrigerated fish, and canned aquatic products totaled 1,008,337 "dan", worth 1,691,602 yuan. Furthermore, no Japanese fishing boats imported any catches in August.</p>
<h3 id="e166">### Cheng Xisheng Killed by Car <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Died Unluckily While Coming to Shanghai to Raise Funds</p>
<p>Family Indignant, Filing a Lawsuit to Seek Justice</p>
<p>Cheng Xisheng, a prominent figure in the business community of Liyang, was elected as a representative to come to Shanghai to raise funds for disaster relief due to the severe floods in the county. After many days of meticulous contact, he was preparing to pack his bags and return home. One night (the 11th), at about 8 o'clock, he went out shopping with his companion, Di Shujing. While walking along Great World Avenue at the entrance of the China Department Store, a No. 737 car suddenly came speeding from behind, with its engine running at full power. Before they could avoid it, Cheng was knocked to the ground. Because the car was going too fast, it couldn't brake in time, causing the wheels to run over his legs and trap his long gown, crushing it in many places. Cheng's body was dragged several feet, resulting in a severe impact to his head and a fractured skull. He immediately lost consciousness. After the police arrived, they sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, while taking the car, the owner, Mr. Lu, and the driver into custody for the time being. Cheng died in the hospital at 2 a.m. the next morning due to his severe injuries. Di, Cheng's companion, went to the police station to request severe punishment for the car in order to redress the wrong done to the deceased. The family of the deceased was extremely indignant and decided to consult with the Liyang native association in Shanghai and charitable organizations to hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, seeking legal justice and redressing the wrong done to the deceased.</p>

<h3 id="e172">### Inquiry from Qu Juejun <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>I joined the army ten years ago and have served as a secretary and other positions. I have also received considerable military training, led soldiers, and fought in battles. My monthly salary is not meager. Unfortunately, the environment is not good, and I always spend everything I earn. Therefore, I often feel that this kind of life is not suitable for my proper profession, and it is not guaranteed at all. Once the director is dismissed or transferred, I become panicked about losing my job. Even if I work twelve points hard and achieve outstanding results, I cannot withstand the current trends of deception and innovation. Moreover, at a time when natural and man-made disasters are occurring one after another, the country is not even a country, and there is even internal strife like "brothers fighting over beans." I really don't want to continue participating in such work of human mutual slaughter. Therefore, I have also made up my mind to change careers. Speaking of changing careers, how easy is it? I want to work, but I don't have the skills. I want to do business, but I don't have the capital. Besides, I can't find the right path. I have no choice but to express my aspirations first. I desperately want to find a proper and stable profession, no matter what it is, even if it's hard. I'm not afraid of that. I only need to be able to settle down and gradually make progress in business and knowledge with my own efforts and loyalty, without working in vain. This is the job that would satisfy me. As for my abilities, it can be said that I have no strengths. However, my physique is still strong, and I am not perfunctory in handling affairs. In my usual studies, I have some knowledge of English. I can translate ordinary books and newspapers, but I am not good at conversation. I also have some knowledge of Chinese official documents and letters. To what kind of industry can someone of my level change? I have translated a short piece in both Chinese and English and submit it for your perusal so that you can decide. Finally, I want to state that the stereotype that "a good man does not become a soldier" has not been fundamentally eradicated in the minds of the general public. If I change careers, I am afraid that others will know that I have worn a tiger's skin and will not dare to approach me. Even if they sympathize with me, they may even suspect that I have abandoned my existing military officer position and have other intentions. If I cause trouble as a result, that would be (wrongful and in vain). Another point is that my original hometown is Shaanxi. I followed my ancestors on official tours when I was young and took the official position as my home. I have not had a fixed residence. The vicissitudes of life have changed repeatedly, and my relatives and friends have withered away, leaving only me alone drifting in Zhejiang. I have been living here for more than twenty years and have not registered my residence. I am neither a native southerner nor a true northerner. Considering my life experience, I feel even more sorrow. Although it is said that under the flag of the blue sky and white sun, all ethnic groups are equal and local concepts should be eliminated, but customs have not changed, and I still feel inconvenienced. Moreover, my friends are all soldiers, and I have little contact with the outside world. I want to change careers, but I have no one to guide me. How can I solve this difficulty? I hope you can give me clear guidance.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your letter evokes deep sympathy and great admiration. I admire your determination to change careers because you do not want to continue participating in the work of human mutual slaughter. I agree with you. Unfortunately, this newspaper does not have a job placement office and I cannot know where there is a need for talent, so I cannot help you in practice. What I can say is that, according to your letter, you have a strong physique, are not perfunctory in handling affairs, and are willing to work hard and faithfully in your career. With these virtues, you will surely have a great development in the future, because these points can be said to be the (successful tickets). Moreover, the works you sent, both Chinese and English, have a considerable foundation, which is very difficult for you. According to your ability, from the perspective of being hired, you can be a clerk or secretary. I'm afraid that's quite enough. From the perspective of self-employment, you may want to try submitting articles to various daily, weekly, and monthly magazines. There may be considerable opportunities. Since you are still serving in the army, do not leave until you have secured a fixed position, so as not to fail.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to earnestly advise you not to be pessimistic, just keep fighting.</p>

<p>I am a woman who has been harmed by my environment. I started school in Hankou Elementary School when I was seven years old. I graduated from elementary school when I was thirteen years old. Just when I wanted to enter middle school, a revolution broke out in Hankou, and warlords disturbed the peace. I came to Shanghai with my parents, and I have lost my education since then. How painful I felt at that time! Later, fortunately, a friend in Shanghai hired my father to Hangzhou to make a living, and the monthly income was only enough to cover expenses. As for my hope of pursuing my studies, it was gone. So I learned needlework to help with household expenses. After three years, my misfortune came. It was the summer of the 18th year of the Republic of China. My parents betrothed me. The other party was a college student. At that time, it was stated that I wanted to study. We got married in the spring of the following year. At first, our relationship was quite good, and he introduced me to a junior high school. Soon, I had a daughter. Because I was weak after giving birth, followed by a serious illness, he insisted on divorcing me and said, ("If you don't want to divorce, I will eventually harm you."). I am a weak woman, unable to make a living and unable to resist. Although we are currently living together, there is no affection at all. He looks at me with contempt all day long. I really have no way to think of it. I can only ask the master to point out a way to make a living for my poor, weak daughter. I am extremely grateful. If there is no limit to the length, please reply in your newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) After giving birth, love changes with appearance. It can be said that the other party is extremely inhuman. Thinking about it for you, there is room to advance and retreat, so there is no need to be pessimistic. First, you should guide the other party with a very sincere and very solemn attitude. You have relatives and friends in Shanghai, and you must have neighbors. You should move around and get to know more people, so that you can get more help when you need it. If it really doesn't work out, it's okay to let go. The other party said, ("If you don't want to divorce, I will eventually harm you.") I think it's a threat, and there won't be any facts. According to Article 1052 of the Civil Code, if one of the spouses intends to kill the other, he can request a divorce from the court. If the other party says this, it is evidence for you to request a divorce, and you can also request compensation and alimony in accordance with Articles 1056 and 1057. You said that when you were in your mother's house, you learned needlework to help with household expenses, so I think you still have the ability to be self-reliant, so you don't have to worry too much about the final disposition. However, we always hope that you two will reconcile.</p>

<p>(Reply) The Shanghai libraries you asked about are listed below:</p>
<p>Oriental Library, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Library (Beihe), Museum Road Library, Shanghai Municipal Council Library (Nanjing Road, Jiangxi Road, next to Moudeli). The above are open to the public.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Library (Xujiahui), Nanyang Middle School Library (Rihui Port), Xujiahui Catholic Church Library (Tushanwan). The above are not open to the public.</p>
<p>Also asked if there is a library more complete than the Oriental Library, I'm afraid it's very difficult to say.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Banquet for Chu Minyi by the National Arts Federation <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Chu Talks About New Shortcuts to Xinjiang</p>
<p>The entire membership of the Shanghai National Arts Groups Federation and fifteen groups, including the Shanghai National Arts Museum, held a banquet yesterday at Jue Lin Public Hall for Chairman Chu Minyi. First, Weng Guozhu of the Wuxue Society stood up to give a speech, followed by Chu's reply. Chu said that he had long been determined to investigate the Northwest. Taking Beijing to Xinjiang as an example, in the past, it relied on the transport of vehicles and horses, which took more than 100 days to reach. Therefore, provinces such as Xinjiang were no less than uncivilized regions. All local products could only be transported out, and foreigners were able to restrict their selling prices. Economic oppression was at their mercy, which was helpless. It was more convenient to go through other countries than through one's own country. This time, with the use of scientific crawling vehicles, the journey has been reduced. From Beijing to Xinjiang, it now only takes more than thirty days. In the future, with some rectification and improvement of roads, etc., crawling vehicles will not even need this many days. Wouldn't this be of great benefit to national defense and people's livelihood? The new province is rich in special products and the people are simple and honest. However, there are many races, and it is not easy to integrate. Examining their physique and life, we Han people are far inferior. The Hui, Kazakh, and Mongol people are mostly strong and brave riders and have a resolute and brave temperament. The Han people have the habit of smoking opium and do not pay attention to physical education. Therefore, racial discrimination has a long history. The purpose of my trip is to open up the route to Xinjiang and to reconcile racial boundaries. In the new region, I wore their clothes and interacted with the locals. There was no separation between conversations and laughter. The national arts taichi exercises, taichi boxing, pushing hands, and equipment that I compiled were repeatedly performed in grand banquets and public groups in the area, with detailed demonstrations. The audience was large and warmly welcomed. Aspiring young people have completed the training in the shortest possible time and have requested the Provincial Department of Education to send them to Beijing to participate in the National Games. If this can be realized, wouldn't it be a happy event? At a time when natural and man-made disasters are imminent, it is important to carefully protect the miraculous effects of virtue and to enforce strict opium prohibition in the world that has already become a major concern.</p>
<p>At a time of internal and external troubles, all of us should work together to promote the popularization of national arts so that the people can exercise together. To seek a good foundation, taichi exercises are quite suitable because their movements are simple and interesting, suitable for both the elderly and the young. They are indeed not comparable to other sports. They will be published soon. Please give us your guidance. As for our Shanghai national arts colleagues, they have always been known for their reputation in previous examinations and competitions. I deeply hope that we can work together to ensure that we always maintain our achievements. Dozens of people at the banquet unanimously agreed and dispersed in joy.</p>
<h3 id="e177">People's Organizations Limited to Reorganize or Organize <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Two Central Regulations</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau to Comply</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has approved the Ministry of Industry's consultation and submission of two measures stipulated by the Central Government for people's organizations that have not fully complied with the regulations or have failed to reorganize or organize within the prescribed time limit. The Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to comply with them and to instruct its subordinates to comply accordingly. The regulations are extracted below: (1) People's organizations that have reorganized or organized without fully complying with the central regulations on reorganization or organization will not be reorganized temporarily. However, the local party departments should order them to be reorganized separately in accordance with the law within one month before the expiration of the term of office of the officials of each people's organization, and then re-elect them to comply with the laws and regulations. (2) People's organizations that have failed to reorganize or organize within the time limit prescribed by the Central Government, except for the reorganization or organization of the Seafarers' Union and the Civil Ship Workers' Union, for which the Central Government has made separate provisions, must be reorganized or organized by October 1 of this year. Those who fail to do so will not be regarded as legal organizations.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Municipal Finance Bureau Stipulates Standard for Converting House Tax Silver to Yuan <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Every Yuan is Equal to Seven Mace, Two Fen, and Five Li</p>
<p>To be Implemented Starting This Winter</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating, "In order to issue a notice, the Bureau's various collection offices collect house tax, which is based on the rent of the donors' houses, and issue tickets for collection by quarter, depending on whether the rent is calculated in silver or yuan. If the rent is calculated in silver, the house tax is also collected in silver. However, the price of silver fluctuates, and temporary conversion is quite cumbersome. In order to facilitate auditing and payment by the donors, the standard for converting silver is specifically stipulated. Starting this winter, all house taxes calculated in silver will be converted to one yuan at a rate of seven mace, two fen, and five li. From now on, the house tax for each quarter will be calculated according to the price set this time, regardless of the rise or fall in the price of silver. This has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and is now in the process of being implemented. In addition to ordering the Bureau's various collection offices to comply, this notice is hereby issued for public information."</p>

<p>Merged Organization</p>
<p>Limited Time to Prepare</p>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee, because Feng Limin et al. and Zhang Chuanbao et al. separately requested to organize the Shanghai Fishermen's Association in accordance with the law, feared that they would compete with each other and affect the fishing industry. They invited representatives from both sides to persuade them to merge and organize together, and to prepare jointly.

Zhang Chuanbao, Feng Limin, etc. are required to merge and organize together and prepare jointly. Both sides are limited to two weeks to each nominate seven representatives and another person will be appointed by this association to form the Municipal Fishermen's Association Preparatory Committee to be responsible for the process.

<h3 id="e181">Labor Dispute at Guanghua Textile Factory Resolved <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Severance Pay to be Paid at the Social Affairs Bureau Today</p>
<p>The Guanghua Textile Factory in Lujiawan of this city previously had a labor-capital dispute due to the manager Gu Yongquan's mistreatment of workers, which had not been resolved for a long time. Later, Gu Yongquan voluntarily left his position in the factory, and the unrest subsided slightly. However, the eleven workers who were fired by Gu Yongquan have not been resolved to this day. The Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation meeting again the other day. Qian Huan Ting, the representative of the factory, and Liu Xitai, the representative of the labor side, attended. As a result of the negotiations, it was agreed to dismiss four people, and each person would be paid 200 yuan in severance pay by the capital side. The severance pay will be paid at the Social Affairs Bureau today.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Municipal Health Bureau Corrects the Production Method of Fushou Brand Pox Vaccine <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau sent the director of the Health Testing Institute to inspect the Aikou Company Pox Vaccine Hall established by Japanese people on Hongqiao Road the other day. They saw that the production method of the Fushou brand pox vaccine they sell did not conform to the health principles. The cattle used for vaccination were not checked for tuberculosis, and the pox vaccine produced was not subjected to bacterial testing. They were hastily sold and applied, which was quite dangerous. All the houses and equipment were also extremely simple and did not meet the health standards. Special guidance was given and an order was issued to improve them, otherwise they would not be allowed to open. Although the Fushou brand pox vaccine was widely sold in the past due to its low price, it has now been found that the production method does not conform to the standards. Before the improvement is completed and approved by the bureau, it is hoped that hospitals and doctors will no longer use it in order to avoid harming the vaccinated people.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Ciyou Association Rescues Kong Sanbao <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Kong Jingqing, who lives at No. 18, Xinhua Li, Tongfu Road, used to be a French businessman. He owned property, smoked opium, and had a concubine. His wife, Ying, was fierce and could not tolerate her. The concubine could not bear her abuse and fled, leaving behind a daughter named Sanbao, who was only four years old. Ying vented her anger on the girl, abusing her severely. The neighbors all felt injustice. Yesterday, she was beaten again. The girl's cheeks were bruised and purple, and she was covered in scars and could not stop crying. Chen Jusheng, a righteous person in the neighborhood, could not bear it and reported it to the China Ciyou Association. The association immediately sent a cadre from the protection department to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to investigate with Chinese and foreign detectives. Kong Jingqing was full of opium and skillfully evaded the investigation, claiming that he had hidden the girl outside. At first, he falsely claimed that her surname was Bao and refused the investigation. Later, when the investigators could not find the girl, Kong demanded compensation for damage to his reputation, and his momentum was fierce and unstoppable. However, when searching the hall and upstairs, they saw many opium utensils. The police pointed to his opium utensils and said, "We are here today to investigate child abuse and will not ask about your opium crime. If you continue to be cunning, we will first seize your opium utensils." Kong's anger was slightly reduced. Xu Ruizhang, the concierge, testified that Kong had asked the nanny to take the girl to the station early this morning to take the express train to Hangzhou. When she left the neighborhood, she saw that the girl's cheeks were bruised and purple, and her hands and feet were injured. Chen's male servant also gave the same testimony. Kong's chauffeur also provided detailed testimony to confirm it. Kong did not dare to argue strongly and confessed that the girl had been abused by his wife, Ying, and he could not bear her pain, so he sent her to Hangzhou for recuperation. The association and the police thought that since he had confessed, they ordered him to hand over the girl and would not arrest him for the time being. Later, lawyer Wu Linkun went to the police station to take responsibility for handing over the girl within a week and was willing to thoroughly protect the girl, designating a kindergarten near the Jing'an Temple Police Station as a place for education and asked the Ciyou Association to take care of her at any time and the police to visit her from time to time to ensure her safety. As for Kong, who violated humanity, I don't know if the police have taken any action to deal with him.</p>

<h3 id="e197">THE COST OF A BOWL OF NOODLES <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>One afternoon last year, I went to the New Allen Cinema hungry and took advantage of the ten-minute intermission to go to the entrance and eat a bowl of noodles. This bowl of noodles cost fourteen copper coins, and it only took five minutes to cook and eat, which was extremely economical. Seeing that there were still five minutes, I took the opportunity to ask about the noodle stall's business situation. The vendor's surname was Shen. The entire set of equipment was worth eighteen yuan, the cost of materials was two yuan, and the monthly donation to the police station was two yuan. He could earn thirty yuan a month. I said that your income is a little better than a village teacher. He said it was hard work, going home at four o'clock every night and getting up at seven o'clock in the morning to buy materials to prepare the noodles and dumplings for the day. If he didn't do this, his family wouldn't be able to live. I saw that Mr. Shen's face was yellow and thin, and it was indeed the result of too much hard work. A bowl of noodles for fourteen copper coins, although a commoner's lunch, is exchanged for the health of another commoner. Thinking about this this year, I was filled with emotion and wrote a poem to send to old Shen, but old Shen has disappeared.</p>
<p>(A bowl of noodles in front of the New Allen gate, costs fourteen small copper coins. The vendor's name is Old Shen, acting as both worker and boss. He can earn thirty yuan a month, better than a teacher running a noodle stall. Who knows, he says (It's hard work, only sleeping three hours a night, if I sleep a moment longer, who will feed my freezing and starving children?) Looking at him from head to toe; a withered tree standing in the autumn wind. I know the cost of the noodles, it's not copper, it's blood!)</p>
<h3 id="e198">FRAGMENTS OF THE CAPITAL <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>

<p>The capital's flood has not yet receded. Xingzhongmen Outer Street is the only way to enter the city from Xiaguan. Previously, the Municipal Works Bureau built a plank bridge at the flooded area to facilitate passage, with sandbags blocking both sides of the bridge. Police officers stood there holding red and green flags to direct vehicles, which was quite special. However, the number of vehicles in the capital has been increasing day by day. In addition to public buses, there are official vehicles from various agencies, unlicensed taxis operating on the streets, as well as horse-drawn carriages and rickshaws. In the past, those entering the city could pass through Yijiangmen, but now they all pass through this road, often causing congestion and making it difficult to pass. Those sitting in the car can often hear the shouts and arguments of the drivers.</p>
<p>People sympathize with disaster relief. Most of the disaster victims in the capital live in makeshift shelters made of reed mats on high ground in the city. Others, such as the platform at Xiaguan Railway Station, also have many refugees sitting and lying there, surviving on just a few steamed buns each day. Since the citizens launched a disaster relief campaign, all parties have enthusiastically donated, greatly benefiting the disaster victims. Currently, various entertainment venues are holding fundraising events. The World and National Cinemas have added a movie screening at 10:00 AM every day, with all ticket revenue going to disaster relief. This is indeed a first. The streets of Xiaguan are flooded, and several small schools are trapped by the water. The start of the semester is approaching, but the students are waiting and watching. However, they cannot be allowed to drop out of school. Therefore, wooden planks are laid in front of the school gates, shaped like gangplanks used when ships dock. The students' families take great care of their children and send servants to accompany them morning and evening. It is heard that in several small schools, classes are still affected by the water. There are not enough classrooms, so the remedy is that students of all grades take turns attending classes in the morning and afternoon, so that they can rest for half a day each day.</p>

<p>Fashion from Seven Thousand Years Ago. Selim Hassan, the famous Egyptian archaeologist, recently excavated the tomb of the ancient Egyptian King Tarso Ankh. He was a prince and the third dynasty's bishop, who ruled Egypt seven thousand years ago. He was well-known. The tomb contains statues of the king and statues of his wife and two daughters. The two daughters are all wearing sky-blue clothes, short collars, open chests, and short skirts that reach just above the knees. Their necks are adorned with jewelry. This is not much different from modern women's clothing.</p>
<p>▲Long-Distance Motorcycle Trip. In the autumn of 1929, an engineer from Bradford, England, and a young man from London, both with adventurous spirits, suddenly had a grand idea one day. They rode a motorcycle from London to Sydney in New South Wales. In March 1930, they arrived in Canberra and soon reached the end point, covering a distance of 17,000 miles. Such a trip is truly not an easy feat. (Sea Guest)</p>
<h3 id="e200">UNHEARD-OF DANCE COMPETITION <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>—Ming</p>
<p>The dance competition held in Paris, France, has caused a global sensation. On the morning of July 22, two French girls danced continuously for 752 hours, about 31 days, setting a new record for long-term dancing, and won a prize of 100 pounds.</p>
<p>When the dance competition opened, the contestants were all young men and women who were usually good at dancing. The competition used the length of time as the standard for winning. Initially, all the dance partners were able to dance day and night without interruption. However, as the days went on, the weaker ones couldn't hold on and left the arena one after another, giving up the championship. In the end, only this winning couple remained. At 4:00 AM on July 22, they also fell to the ground from exhaustion.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the female partner, Xiao Su, whispered, (I can't dance anymore.) But counting the days, it had already reached 752 hours. The others had already left. Moreover, another dance partner suddenly stopped dancing the day before because the female partner injured her foot. Otherwise, they would have been formidable rivals. It was impossible to predict who would win.</p>
<p>During the dance competition, the consumption of shoes by this pair of dance partners was unprecedented. In these 31 days, the female partner wore out 20 pairs of shoes, and the male partner wore out 8 pairs. As a result of the competition, the second prize went to the dance partner who stopped the day before, with a difference of only half a day. It was both fortunate and unfortunate.</p>
<p>The competition held in Paris was quite successful. As a result, the organizers plan to hold another one in London in the near future, with a prize of as much as 1,600 pounds. As for the competition method, participants can only stop for 15 minutes every hour. The remaining time must be spent dancing continuously day and night. The couple with the longest time without interruption will win the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e201">NEW SOUNDS IN THE SPRING COLOURS OF THE SINGING STAGE <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Han</p>
<p>The last days of summer have arrived, and the heat is receding. The evening breeze is cool, and the mind feels more refreshed. Suddenly, I received a call from Drunkard Weng, saying that the newly filmed (Spring Colours of the Singing Stage) would be screened informally at the Guanglu Cinema, inviting me to watch it. I happily hired a car and went. When I arrived, the screening was about to begin. After taking my seat for a moment, I heard the sound of music coming from the screen. It was the overture performed by the music troupe led by the famous musician Henry Natnan. The softness and clarity of the light and the accuracy and clarity of the sound are indeed no different from the best imported films. The whole play begins and ends with singing, which is very intriguing. The first song is (The Joy of Youth), with lyrics and music by Li Jinhui. The lyrics are: (1) The spring light is beautiful, the spring colour is charming, the spring feeling is deep, the spring heart is quiet. The pear blossom face is too enchanting, the apricot eyes contain affection, and the peach looks are with smiles. The green is curved, the willow eyebrows are long, and the red is beautiful. The cherry is small. The spring sun is warm, and the spring clouds are vast. Dance in the spring breeze. The willow waist is slender, the fresh flowers are blooming, and the tender stamens contain buds. Don't let down the arrival of the new spring. (2) The spring light is beautiful, the spring colour is charming, the spring feeling is deep, the spring heart is quiet. Open the curtains and arrange the sheng and xiao. The good couple comes together, and good friends arrive together. Love is continuous, like two fish side by side. Love is earnest, like two birds living together. The melody is melodious, and the singing is beautiful. Dance lightly, embracing each other. The love flower is blooming, and the love stamens contain buds. Don't let down the youth. (Finale) The new spring colour, the good spring light, take advantage of the youth, enter the joy. Plant the seeds of love. Love will be eternal and affection will be long. Open the flowers of joy. Joy will be boundless. Bear the fruit of happiness. Happiness will be boundless. Good friends are paired. Lovers are together. Don't let down the passionate singing. The last song is (Kapok Wind), with lyrics by Gao Tianqi and music by Qiu Qixiang. The lyrics are: 1. The afterglow flies in the sky. The setting sun is faint and sleepy. How can you bear to see the good scenery go by in a hurry? The intimate feelings are both vast and tender. Spring goes, dreams like smoke. The heartbroken person stands in the evening breeze. 2. The butterflies flutter. The fallen flowers are red and pitiful. The willow silk does not tie the spring light. Rain is bitter, and the wind is sour for another year. Two swallows talk in front of the curtain. New sorrows and old hatreds are all intertwined.</p>
<p>▲Acknowledgement. Yesterday, I received a copy of (Yan Tai Ju Cui First Collection - Complete Edition - Visiting Mother and Returning Orders) from Mr. Xu Siqian. The book was written by the Erhu master Chen Yanheng, based on the script of the famous Tan Xinpei, and the music is scored in Gongche notation. It is indeed a work of great value. I would like to express my gratitude here, as well as introduce it.</p>
<h3 id="e202">THE AMERICAN FILM INDUSTRY (II) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>—Ji Ping</p>
<p>The American film industry is really in a slump right now. The lower and middle classes are struggling with the bread and butter issue, and there seems to be no way to solve it. People who have always been addicted to movies are now oppressed by economic forces and have no interest in going to the movies. According to the reports of major theaters, the average number of viewers has decreased by more than 30% in the past year. Many theaters have closed down due to declining business. The sales of films produced by film companies have also been greatly affected. When I (Hong's self-reference) was in Hollywood, in addition to the three major companies, Fox, R.K.O., and Paramount, several others reduced production and barely maintained, while several others were already in a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>In the past, when the film industry was booming, film companies often spent hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars on shooting a film. The salaries of star directors were so generous that they were truly shocking. Now that the film industry has declined, all companies are adopting a tightening policy and laying off actors on a large scale. As a result, many people have lost their jobs. If a film is to be shot, the director must first make a precise budget, which must be approved by the company before it can be implemented. It is not like before, when funds could be used without limitation. There are also companies that sign contracts with directors to buy their independently produced films. The adoption of this contracting system is nothing more than an expedient measure to save expenses and reduce costs.</p>
<p>Two big stars in Hollywood have recently had stories. One is director Ernst Lubitsch, and the other is female star Clara Bow. They are both resentful and negative because of (love), to the point of sacrifice. Ernst Lubitsch is willing to work hard to study film art, so his directed productions are popular all over the world and his name is famous for a time. He had a friend, a screenwriter whom he had promoted to fame, who had an ambiguous relationship with Lubitsch's wife. Lubitsch was greatly stimulated by this and his mood deteriorated, which affected his work. The content of his new film (The Smiling Lieutenant) is not as good as before. From this, we can see the importance of psychological state and life relationship. Clara Bow is one of Hollywood's biggest stars. Recently, she was blackmailed by a tabloid that failed and defamed her, resulting in losses in both reputation and status. The editor of the tabloid has recently been arrested and imprisoned for eight years. Although she won the lawsuit, she is afraid that she will retire from now on.</p>
<p>In recent years, major theaters in the United States have had many new facilities, such as (1) Another stage is set up at the entrance of the theater to perform miscellaneous operas, so that the audience who have already bought tickets and are waiting at the entrance will not feel lonely. (2) A room is set up to store children, and female nurses are hired to take care of them. Many women like to bring their children to the theater, but sometimes they cry and laugh, which disrupts the order and causes opposition from the audience. Their facility is like a temporary kindergarten, which is convenient for women and audiences. The method of storing children there is the same as storing clothes and hats in restaurants and dance halls. A number is also taken, and when picking them up, just give the number to the nurse, match the number, and the child will be picked up. I think that major theaters at sea can follow this example. The cost is limited, but the effect is great. Why not do it?</p>

<h3 id="e203">A HUSBAND'S WIFE (XIV) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>Mr. Li's emotions were really like a torrent. At first, he just thought that if he had someone like Mrs. Chen to accompany him to see movies and go to dance halls, his life could be a lot richer. His own wife was far less beautiful and generous than Mrs. Chen. Having a woman like Mrs. Chen running around with him was like a very honourable thing; he achieved this goal, so he planned how to further express himself to Mrs. Chen. Once, sitting together watching a movie, he leaned his body closer to her, secretly observing whether she would refuse or sit away in the opposite direction? But she seemed not to notice, and remained still. His heart was pounding, almost to the point where he could hear the sound of his heart beating. He secretly used all his strength in the dark and slightly bright light to focus on her eyelashes, to focus on her expression, and felt that they were beautiful and kind. She coughed slightly by chance, and he asked her very gently and lowly: (Are you a little cold)? As he said that, he reached out to hold her hand. He had held her hand very generously—or rather, very tolerantly—in front of Mr. Chen before. Now, this handshake position was not special at all, but the psychological composition was completely different. The passionate emotions seemed to pass like electricity to his fingertips, and contact with her warm and soft palm seemed to cause sparks.</p>
<p>She quickly turned her head towards him with a shallow smile, (Oh)? This sound seemed to pretend not to understand, and seemed to indicate acceptance of this electric conduction. It was very charming and gentle, arousing—perhaps enticing—him to have the opportunity to say a second sentence.</p>
<p>(You're coughing, are you cold?) Seeing that she didn't refuse, he held her hand tighter.</p>
<p>(No. Your hand is cold.)</p>
<p>He pretended to loosen her hand, wanting to retract his own hand. But she held his hand tightly and didn't let go.</p>
<p>(Your hand will get cold too.)</p>
<p>(No, I'll warm it for you.) She simply covered his hand with her other hand. He fully understood her emotions, which were also firing at the other party, just like two ships in the ocean, each approaching the other, echoing each other and sending wireless signals to each other, so he planned to make a further expression.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Financial Gold Price Trends Upward Again <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>▲ Gold Rises Seven Taels, Six Mace: Yesterday, the 14th, the standard gold price once again soared, moving swiftly. The difference between the highest and lowest price of the day was only two or three taels, with an overall market spread of about ten taels. Buyers were excited. It was said that the sellers believed the settlement date was approaching, fearing they would have to pay a premium, so they vigorously resisted, appearing quite panicked. The final result was a rise of almost ten taels. Initially, the market was relatively flat, with the silver bars slightly declining compared to the previous day. Later, foreign exchange showed explicit easing but implicit tightening. With buyers being particularly strong, prices rose sharply, breaking through the 770 tael mark. Subsequently, the market stabilized, fluctuating by only two or three taels. Drafts contracted by half a point. Market confidence was strong, with expectations of 72 taels or more. It was rumored that the large bars might fall this morning.</p>
<p>▲ Morning Close Sees Vigorous Growth: The October opening price this morning rose slightly by six candareens, reaching 763 taels and 7 mace. The large bar silver for forward delivery only fell by one-sixteenth. The current spot price of silver remained unchanged. US stocks declined by just over four dollars. In the market, Zhi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Ri Chang, and others all advanced, continuing from 63 taels and 5 mace to 7 taels and 5 mace. Later, because Yuan Mao Yong, Yong Feng, Fu Shun, and others were privy to HSBC's impending increase in posted rates, they retreated to 4 taels and 2 mace. In an instant, Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, Sen Chang Yong, Tong Tai Chang, and others came to purchase, raising the price by 4 taels. Nearly all British gold firms were settling for December at 1.25, and had increased to 8 taels and 45 mace. When the British gold announcement indeed showed an increase of 1.25, US gold by 0.25, and Japanese gold a decrease of 1.5 fen, it immediately retreated to 7 taels and 5 mace. Heng Yu Yuan Cheng Yong and others sold, at which time the price fell from 68 taels to 6 taels. Internal markets were flat. October still settled at 1.25. After 10 o'clock, Yuan Xing Yong, Ri Chang, Yu Da, Qian Chang Xiang, Tong Tai Chang, Fu Chang Bing Xing, and others all advanced, selling British gold at 1.25, causing the gold price to surge by 4 taels, fluctuating by only a few candareens to one tael. Soon after, it exceeded 70 taels, reaching 70 taels and 0.3 mace by 11:30. At this time, Sumitomo sold December British gold at 1.25, and with Heng Xing Da De Cheng and others also selling, it immediately retreated to 69 taels and 3 mace. Subsequently, British gold remained firm, with October settling at only 0.0625. Zhi Feng Yong Yuan Cheng Chun Yuan Yong Bing Xing Yong Feng Hong Xing and others were all vying to purchase, instantly rising 4 taels. Indian exchange rates showed small short-term gains and larger long-term gains, but not exceeding one anna. At noon, it reached 73 taels and a half, then closed at 3 taels, with the posted price revised to 783 taels, a decrease of 15 to 10 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Post-Market Consolidation: The post-market opened at 73 taels and 1 mace, then 3 taels and 9 mace. Indian exchange fell slightly by one anna, but with Bing Xing Yuan Xing Yong selling, it retreated to 2 taels and 8 mace. Later, Yuan Mao Yong Da De Cheng and others bought in, and Mitsui also purchased October British gold at 3 pence, further shrinking British gold by 0.125, US gold by 0.25, and Japanese gold increasing by 1.5 fen, reaching 73 taels and 5 mace by 2:30. Subsequently, HSBC offered November British gold at 3 pence, but Tong Tai Chang continued to sell, so it fell slightly by 2 taels. At 3:30, it was 70 taels and 0.7 mace. Suddenly, it was heard that Indian exchange had fallen slightly by one anna, and was being dragged in by arbitrage, reaching 2 taels and a half at 4:00. Afterwards, it fluctuated slightly by one tael, reaching 1 tael and 6 mace at one point. The market closed at 4:30 at 72 taels and 7 mace, an increase of 9 taels and 6 mace compared to last Saturday. The highest price for the entire day was 73 taels and 9 mace, and the lowest was 63 taels and 5 mace, a difference of 10 taels and 4 mace.</p>
<p>▲ Spot Red Transactions Flat: The spot price in the early market was 60 taels and 8 mace, the noon close was 73 taels, the afternoon was 3 taels and 3 mace, and the closing price was 3 taels. The initial posted price decrease was around 10 taels, later revised to 790 taels and 0.2 mace, a decrease of 17 to over 19 taels, and finally over 17 taels. Recorded prices were 70 taels and 72 taels, with the premium before and after the market remaining at 70 taels. Spot red bars were flat. The firm Yíng Fēng Héng Tóng Fēng Yǒng sold several hundred taels to the guest trading houses at a price increasing by 7 taels and 7 mace and 5 candareens.</p>
<p>▲ Buyers Predominate in Transactions: According to statistics, Cheng Feng Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Fu Yu, Fu Chang, Yuan Kang Xiang, Tong Tai Chang, Wan Xing, Cui Chang Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Bing Xing, Sen Chang Yong, and Chun Yuan Yong all bought in. Da De Cheng, Shun Li, Qian Chang Xiang, and Fu Tai Heng sold more than they bought. Yuan Mao Yong's buying and selling were balanced, still selling over 400 bars. Heng Xing also sold over 200 bars. Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Tai, Yong Feng, Yuan Heng, Da Xing Yong, and Yuan Chun had occasional transactions. Speculator Wu bought and sold. In the afternoon, Da De Cheng, Heng Xing, Yuan Sheng Yuan Heng, and Yuan Tai all bought in. As for the physical bars, Shun Li, Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Xing Yong, Bing Xing, Zhi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, and Fu Chang all sold. The Cantonese traders bought in after selling earlier, for a total of just over 500 bars. Including non-Cantonese traders, the buying and selling were similar, for a total of 1500-1600 bars. Because arbitrage was not favorable, there were no large-scale transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Large Bar Silver Narrows Near Term, Flat Far Term <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>

<p>Posted Rates Increase in Morning, Decrease in Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's posted rates increased and then decreased. In the morning, the British exchange rate increased by 0.125, the US dollar by 0.25, and the Japanese gold decreased by 1.5 fen.

All other rates also decreased, except for the Hong Kong rate, which remained unchanged. As for the trend in the domestic market, it was tightened. It was firm from the morning and then became even stronger. The post-market showed a steady state. Compared to last Saturday, the British gold decreased by 0.1875, the US dollar by 0.375, and the Japanese gold increased by 1.5 fen. The gold market had already broken through the 70 tael mark. This was due to the settlement date approaching, forcing those with short positions to quickly cover. Chinese merchants engaged in settlement again. There were some sales in the afternoon. It is estimated that a total of over 200,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and only a small amount of US dollars changed hands. The Japanese gold trading was only several tens of thousands of yuan. The market conditions have improved.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange Domestic Market: The increase and decrease were measured in 0.125 increments. The morning offer price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 0.0625 to 0.125, the buying price was 0.125 to 0.1875.

<h3 id="e207">Silver Dollar Market Appears Calm <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>▲ Market Conditions: Trading in the market yesterday was still not very active. Compared to last Monday, there was a significant difference. Currently, the financial community is concerned about the massive losses from the recent Han River disaster, the stockpiling of goods, and the impact on businesses, inevitably leading to financial strain. Therefore, although the exterior appears calm, there are genuine hidden worries. The current tightness of the silver supply is likely the cause.</p>
<p>▲ Premium/Discount Prices: (Silver Premium) The early market premium was 7 candareens, 2 fen, 4 li, 7 hao, and a half, which was equivalent to the early market of the previous day. The noon market was slightly smaller by 1 hao and 2 hu and a half, at 7 candareens, 2 fen, 4 li, 6 hao, and 2 hu and a half.

<p>Unified Tax 20th Issue All Up Over One Yuan</p>
<p>Other Issues Also Up Several Candareens to Eight or Nine Candareens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for bonds was extremely quiet. The futures market was also slightly calmer than last week. Except for the early market, which was still quite active, the post-market session was rather dull, with significant fluctuations. The market was still weak at the beginning, slightly lower than the previous weekend. Subsequently, with demand exceeding supply, all prices rebounded sharply. The post-market session initially continued to be strong, but the market showed signs of loosening at the close. However, market conditions appeared to be quite good. As a result, compared to the previous week, the unified tax issue rose by 1 yuan and 34 candareens, the 20th issue rose by 1 yuan, and the remaining issues also rose by several candareens to eight or nine candareens. Only the salt tax issue for September was slightly weaker than before. The total futures trading volume was over 9.4 million in the morning and over 6.2 million in the post-market session, for a total of over 15.6 million yuan.

<h3 id="e209">Cotton Yarn and Cotton Prices Stabilize <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has stabilized, but the situation for imported cotton yarn is not good, trending downwards. Local sentiment is still good because there are fewer new sellers, and the exchange floor is tight. However, Japanese merchants are selling from time to time, and the actual sales volume in the market is still small. Sporadic transactions continue. Currently, most are in short positions, due to the severe floods in all directions, which may impact future demand.</p>
<p>▲ Near-Month Man-Marked Yarn Trending Upwards: The man-marked yarn market opened in the early market with fewer sellers. Although imported cotton was down slightly, market sentiment remained firm, with each month rising by 2-3 mace. The market opened firmly in the afternoon, but two or three varieties trended downwards and market conditions weakened again, with near months rising by 1-2-3 mace and far months falling by 1-2-3 mace. A total of 11,600 bales were traded. Public Tai sold 1,300 bales, Rui Da 700 bales, Yi Yu 2,400 bales, Geng Feng 1,050 bales, and Tian Long 600 bales. Hou Feng Chang bought 1,050 bales, Tong Yu 2,250 bales, De Ji 950 bales, and Chang Feng 750 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Man-Marked Yarn Closing Prices Increase/Decrease Remaining Account</p>

<p>October 152.8 4,759 bales, January 151.8 1,752 bales</p>
<p>January 152.5 6,933 bales, February 151.8 1,387 bales</p>
<p>▲ Increased Activity in Yarn Sales: There has been increased activity in current yarn sales. Statistics show that all groups bought a total of 1,400 bales of current yarn and 2,000 bales of futures. Prices were flat. Among the customer groups, 380 bales were imported to the mainland, 250 bales to Qingdao, 75 bales to Luzhou, 100 bales to Jiangxi, 210 bales to Tianjin, 150 bales to Guangdong, 115 bales to the North Group, 20 bales to the Sichuan Group, 300 bales to Zhenjiang, 500 bales to Hankou, and 50 bales to Miscellaneous Groups. 830 bales were imported by the same trade.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Cotton Market Dull and Unremarkable <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is extremely dull, as the American cotton market is weak, trending downwards, leading to poor sentiment. However, the local weather is not good, and new sellers are cautious, so the exchange floor remains tight. Market prices cannot fall accordingly. Japanese merchants and speculators, viewing the unstable global situation, are unanimously selling short. Domestic cotton merchants, considering the severe floods in all directions and the poor production, are uniquely taking long positions.</p>
<p>▲ Lack of Sellers in the Hankou-Marked Cotton Market: The Hankou-marked cotton exchange opened in the early market with tight sentiment due to the lack of sellers. As a result, the current month rose by 2 mace and the far month was flat. The market remained tight after opening in the afternoon, but the second round fell back, resulting in a flat outcome. The total trading volume for the entire day was 40,500 dan. Mei Ji sold 2,500 dan, Yuan Da 2,300 dan, Geng Feng 2,200 dan, Yi Yu 2,300 dan, Tai Xing 1,100 dan, and Tian Long 1,800 dan. Ji Feng bought 4,500 dan, Xin Cheng 1,800 dan, Chang He 1,300 dan, Public Tai 1,000 dan, Tong Yu 1,900 dan, and Chang Feng 1,300 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>▲ Bombay: Due to multiple holidays last week and waiting for the US cotton government report, business was slow. After the report was released, although the market price fell, the financial plans of New York and Liverpool for US cotton exports were beneficial to the long position, so the market was quite stable. Exporters bought very little. Buying power was normal, except for speculative purchases and covering short positions. Even if US cotton rises, Bombay may not follow. In terms of current goods, Omura and Pingguoer are very popular with Japanese exporters and local manufacturers. European exporters remain indifferent. The statistics for last week are attached below (units: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1930 1931</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts since September 1 168</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 600 515</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports since September 1 35 25</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 2110</p>
<p>Shipped to the Country 63</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 810</p>
<p>Other regions... 2</p>
<p>▲ Liverpool: Current goods trading increased last week. In terms of futures, at the beginning of the week, short covering and continental sales were constrained by the US cotton holiday and before the US cotton government report was released. Although the report was negative, it did not have much impact here, so the market price remained firm. The Egyptian cotton market was quiet, with prices rising and falling with US cotton.</p>

<p>▲ Southern Market: Yesterday, the sources of rice from various regions at the Feng Ji Wharf on the riverbank became scarce, and the local shops felt more active. Changxi and North Japonica, as well as Su Tong White Japonica, increased by 2-3 candareens. The arrival of early and late rice was also limited. Ningbo rice and local street transactions were scarce, and market prices rose by around 2 candareens. Luzhou Pointed High Grade was very scarce, and central lodging sales were sluggish and tight. 80 stones of Tao Zhuang New Pointed arrived, with the rice quality being good. The arrival of new Japonica was slightly sparse, and the stomach capacity was still acceptable, with the situation increasing by 2.5 candareens.</p>
<p>▲ New Gate: Yesterday, inland sources were blocked by the wind, and fewer arrived. Local transactions were not active. North Japonica cargo from Zhongguan rose sharply by 2 candareens. Over 500 stones of thin rice were stockpiled by upstairs warehouses, and the situation also rose by 1 candareen. Foreign Luzhou Pointed and New Japonica competed for sales, and the overall market tightened. Foreign rice from customer groups and shops was quite smooth, and the situation increased by 1-2 candareens. Around 5,000 dan of cargo arrived at various river factories.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Foreign Rice Sales Dull and Continue to Weaken <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Slight Receipts on This Street</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice still lacked any improvement. Customer groups showed no interest, and this street also lacked active sales. Foreign firms, due to small foreign telegram reports, were selling to Chinese merchants, and had already sent out several price inquiry telegrams recently. If there are transactions, the post-market must still be viewed as softening. However, current sales are sluggish, and the market is already showing a downward trend step by step. Yesterday, it fell slightly by 3-5 fen, and the local street and storage groups purchased slightly over 1,500 bags of short strings, with prices opening at 13 yuan and 0.05 fen and 13 yuan, and then down to 12 yuan and 7 jiao. Storage groups were also inquiring about futures rice, and the market condition was also weaker than last week. Zen Chan sold 500 tons, and Saigon rice opened with the second best grade at 2,500 bags, with prices at 13 yuan and 8 jiao and a half to 13 yuan and 4 jiao and 7 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Flour Manufacturers Hedging Sales in the Market <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw the price of foreign wheat reported down by 3-5 jiao in the morning, but actual sales were sluggish. Northern flour merchants were hedging sales, and factory sales were also stagnant, selling into the market. Therefore, the market weakened after closing. Morning prices in the middle three or four rounds were down about 1 fen from last week. In the afternoon, mainland merchants and scattered shorts covered their positions, and the market began to stabilize. However, compared to last weekend's closing price, near and far months had all declined. September was down by 0.5 fen, October and November were down by 0.5 fen each, December was down by 0.25 li, and January was down by 0.75 li, with January down by 0.25 li.</p>

<h3 id="e234">The Chinese Language Teacher <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Dapan</p>
<p>This Chinese language teacher is short and thin. Although he's around forty years old, he has quite a few wrinkles on his face. He sometimes walks energetically, but with a somewhat forced manner.</p>
<p>During his class, our students are very undisciplined, some talking, some giggling. But the teacher painstakingly went through a vernacular text word by word, sentence by sentence, and then asked the students,</p>
<p>(Do you understand?</p>
<p>If you don't, I'll explain it again.)</p>
<p>Before these words even passed through the students' nervous systems, and without anyone saying whether they understood or not, he picked up the textbook and repeated the explanation. The bell rang, and the students panicked, hastily stuffing their books into their desks, not even bowing to the teacher, and ran away as if fleeing. At this time, only a cacophony of voices and the "dong, dong" sound of books being slammed on desks could be heard. It seemed even more chaotic than a performance at the Great World entertainment center. The teacher looked at the students grabbing their textbooks, looking disappointed, and left the classroom.</p>
<p>The next day, the teacher was teaching again, continuing to explain that vernacular text. He casually found the character "乐" (lè, joy) in a sentence, and inadvertently recited two sentences from the Analects, ("The benevolent find joy in mountains; the wise find joy in water…"). Seeing the phrase "(Labor is sacred)," he recited two sentences from Mencius, ("When Heaven is about to confer a great responsibility on any man, it will first exercise his mind with suffering, and his sinews and bones with toil…")</p>
<p>(Have you read the Four Books? If you have, you'll understand the meaning of these sentences.)</p>
<p>At this point, the air in the classroom suddenly became quiet for a moment, and the students' gazes were all fixed on the textbook. But regarding the teacher's words, they looked at each other, indicating a sense of bewilderment.</p>
<p>Once, the teacher was talking about imperialism. He said, (Imperialism is a monarchical autocratic country, meaning some countries that have an emperor, that is imperialism. The imperialist countries in the world today are England and Japan, because they have emperors.)</p>
<p>At this point, one-third of the students in the entire class were whispering and discussing the teacher's words. A classmate, Chen, stood up and attacked the teacher.</p>
<p>(Teacher, imperialism isn't explained like that in the Three Principles of the People.)</p>
<p>The teacher smiled and said without hesitation,</p>
<p>(Yes, imperialism may have other explanations in party doctrine, but I am teaching Chinese language. You must understand this point.)</p>
<p>This Mr. Chen sat down unnaturally, his face filled with an air of dissatisfaction. A Mr. Wang next to me, who had caused trouble at another school and came here, was very timid. I encouraged him to stand up and argue, but he said,</p>
<p>(I understand it, so why bother making trouble with him… if I get a major demerit, that wouldn't be wise.)</p>
<p>"Dang, dang," the bell rang, and the classroom was as noisy as usual. The teacher, looking disappointed as ever, walked away with his textbook.</p>
<h3 id="e235">After the Start of Classes <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Kuiyun</p>
<p>The school issued many yellow envelopes. The students all sorted out their wardrobes and book boxes, and rushed here one after another. They came in a hurry and left in haste. Just what was it all about?</p>
<p>Jiangwan Road, which had been quiet for almost two months, was lively again at this time. Cars sped past, dust billowed, and rickshaw pullers seemed to be racing to win a championship. High heels banished the hopping little sparrows. Clear, delicate laughter awakened the stagnant trains. Everything was spirited, everything was more beautiful.</p>
<p>In the brand-new three-story building, built with yellow bricks and painted with white walls, rows of shiny benches were filled with many young ladies. At the very beginning, many unfamiliar faces surged in, surging into our classroom. They were so stiff and proper, while we were slick and playful. Mr. Wu was gesticulating and talking about something about Eve and Adam, which was tiresome to hear. Except for them, no one paid attention to him. Some were reading books, some were writing letters, so it was very quiet at this time.</p>
<p>(Look,) Jing took a pencil in her right hand and passed a piece of paper over with her left.</p>
<p>Looking back at the teacher, she smiled with pursed lips.</p>
<p>(Hey, look,) Xia happily passed the paper to someone else, stuffed the novel in her hand into the drawer, and suddenly let out a very loud laugh. The teacher turned around and just kept saying (Jingzi, be quiet,) but we continued to laugh, laughing so much that he and they were confused.</p>
<p>The bell rang, and he was still shouting (Be quiet, be quiet,) while wiping his face with a handkerchief, walking out with a red nose.</p>
<p>(Annoying bald head, he thinks we're laughing at him,)</p>
<p>The group said, and then casually stuffed the sketch of the fat man into the wastepaper basket.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Guidelines for the Youth Forum <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>(1) Articles should be about discussions on youth issues, domestic and foreign school or student life, etc., without restriction.</p>
<p>(2) Chinese paintings should be about those related to youth.</p>
<p>(3) Photos that qualify include youth life (plus sports, travel, excursions, theater performances, etc.), school news, and youth sports, etc. Individuals and groups are welcome. Do not write on both sides of the manuscript paper.</p>
<p>(4) Each article should not exceed two thousand words.</p>
