<p>惟勇者乃能承認事實之眞相。惟智者乃能從事實中求出路。今請就昨評所提出之三問題。加以事實與理由之申述。非敢故意求瑕索疵。其眞實用意。乃在於求從過去事實之眞相中闢開今後廣坦之出路。</p>
<p>第一問題之提出其中心意義。在於希望負敎育之責者重視敎育。有責任之自覺。就事實言。過去學校招生。大部分或爲「照例。」或爲「爲學校。」所謂「照例」者何。學校之所賴以延續生命者。厥爲班班相承之學生。故有一班舊學生畢業離校。即應招一班新學生補允。新陳代謝。以綿延學校生命至於無窮然而問其於招生之先曾否計及社會需要何種人材。學生能有何種出路。如何敎。如何使學生蒙受敎育之實益。如對者能掬誠作負責之答覆。吾人敢斷言能於招生之先。曾計及上述諸問題者百中或僅有一二焉。此爲「照例。」即照例招生照例敎學。舊學生照例畢業去新學生照例招進來。循環的照例。照例的循環。除照例外。敎者學者都無所謂「招」與「就」之責任也。所謂「爲學校」者何。本月十八日朱經農先生在北平世界學會學術講演團講演「敎育的歧路」中有云。「有多數私立大學招生時。抱來者不拒主義完全靠學生學費。」又曰「有某大學學生讀書一年。即可畢業者。」朱君爲前任敎育部次長言當可信。招生之動機。爲學生乎爲社會乎。爲國家乎。抑爲學校乎。明眼人自可作答。照例招生者爲不負責任。爲學校招生者。則更爲使學校巿塲化。使學生原料化。「照例」招生與「爲學校」招生。在學校當局。固毫無所損。或且有益。然而其將何以善社會之後。其將何以善學生之後。此記者之所以提出第一問題也。</p>
<p>第二問題之所以提出其中心意義。則爲希望敎育能普及。不至繼續崎形發展之現象何以言之。近世以來。我國農村經濟日趨破産。中農以上。日漸破落。中農以下。更趨於無法生存。然而另一方面。則敎育費用。小學每年需費數十金。中學二三百金。大學則更逹五六百金。金築校門。惟城巿上層社會之子弟。乃能跨過。其日漸破落之戶。即或以剜肉之方法。忍痛送其子弟入學。然而其能不中途輟學者無幾也。其幸而能受盡中等敎育者更無幾也。至於無法生存之貧苦羣衆。則更終其身。以至終其子子孫孫之身。惟有高山仰止。對龍門長嘆而已耳。故不久以前。上海曾有因無法爲兒子籌措學費而一死以謝之父親。故全國内擁有百分之八十以上之文盲。事之不平。孰逾於此。影響之大。又孰逾此。今年災遍全國民更苦無死所。而學校之招生如故也。學生之來自何種社會層。顧亦曾予以注意乎。或曰此爲政府之責。非學校所能顧及者也。然矣。然而否否。改進社會制度。改進敎育行政。使國人都有受敎育之機會。政府之責也。吾人暫且置不論列。就力之所能及。爲可以深造之貧苦子弟謀可能之就學機會。則學校當局之責也。岸然道貌。舉目但見富裕闊綽之學生入學。貧苦父兄之苦臉不見也。貧苦子弟之飲泣不聞也。則敎育非爲公物。而爲一部分人所私有矣。敎育乃呈其缺陷矣。此記者之所以提出第二問題也。國内要電三</p>

<p>兄弟今天來代表上海市敎育局演講本局二十年度中等學校職業設施計劃、這個講演、預備把他分做三大部份來說、第一先講本巿中等學校職業設施的目的、第二再說本巿三個中等學校添設職業組的計劃、最後再來講本局推行生産敎育的關係、</p>
<p>現在先設本巿中等學校職業設施的目的、諸位大家都明白敎育這件事業、不是最終的目的、只可以說是爲人羣解决他們所需要解决的問題的一種工具、我國現在所急需解决的是什麽問題呢、吾可以簡單的說一下、</p>
<p>我們現在覺得社會不安、人心不定、大部份都爲的是經濟關係、換句話說就是我們孫總理無主張的民生問題、設有相當的解决、所以在這種經濟落後的中國狀况之下、要想靠着敎育來救民、救社會、救國家、非把一向辦敎育有的宗旨改變一下不興、我們曉得我國興學幾十年社會上直接得到利益的很少、因爲辦學的不顧及社會的需要、社會上的需要、辦敎育的都不會設法去滿足、因此把敎育界造成了一種特殊偕級、其結果變做敎育是敎育、社會是社會、那種情形的敎育、學校就會變成空洞知識的販賣塲、學生呢、最好也不過做成其而無當的理想者、學校裏理的活動就會偏於頭腦方面、手足勞動的活動、就永遠夢想不到了、尤其是我國的中等學校、有人說靑年一進了中學校、就會産生二種現象、第一不會操作、第二不肯努力、所以一進了中學的學生决不肯到商店裏去當學徒、女子中學畢業生决不願意在家庭知操作、你們想現在社會上是否需要這種不會操作不肯努力的人才、因此有許多商店、要是雇用職員的時候、再也不敢請敎中學畢業生了、將來、他們唯一的出路、就是升入大學、除此之外只有夠上一個高等游民的資格、這是目前中等敎育最大的弱點、就是没有勞作的意味、和職業的訓練、這種弱點也可說是違背了我們孫總理雙手萬能的主張、將來一定要個個中學生變手無能主那時候的社會國家還有什麽希望、因爲結合社會國家的各個份子、都是分利而不是生利、現在要補救這種弱點、認定目前我國社會需要的所在點、一致努力向生産化的敎育方面做去、那末或者還有一些最後的希望、本局鑒到這種社會需要、所以在中等敎育一階叚、竭力設法推行生産敎育、使上海市民將來都受着勤勞操作的職業訓練、慢慢地走上生産的康莊大道上去、這就是本巿中等學校職業設施的目的、（未完）</p>

<p>美國是一個多法律之國。他們所施行的法令。計有二百萬餘種之多。最有趣的。是一千九百二十三年十二月間。密歇根州Michigan的某鎭中。通過一條法律。禁止男女們在公共塲所跳舞時。雙方的眼睛。不許互相接觸。一接觸即爲犯法。可是這是一件最容易違犯的事。被罰的人可就多了。此外如西南部某州的議會中。制定女子禁用脂粉。又有烏克拉訶麥Oklahoma州中。以敎授男女的發育爲犯罪。這種法律。未免過於嚴厲。而近乎矯枉過正了。</p>

<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>近數年來。我國對外交涉之差强人意者。莫如收回租借地。而實行交接者。要以靑島威海爲矯矢。威海形勢險要。管鑰渤海。爲我國海防重鎭。自經正式收回。政府劃爲行政區。設管理公署。簡徐祖善氏爲專員。徐君文武兼資。並嫻外交。任事以來。勵精圖治。興革萬端。地方治安整肅。可以夜不閉戶。雖英人偪處密邇。亦無間言。其地氣候淸凉。風景殊絕。實兼擅普陀莫干之勝。爲卜居消夏最良區域。巿區之中部。背負奈姑山。山麓有環翠樓。尤擅一邑之勝。春夏晴明。登臨觀海。偶可見蜃樓海巿。惟建築年久。漸就傾圯。現經徐專員重行興建。自此名樓勝境。並足千古矣。工事旣竟。篵君特爲之記。亦威海之沿革史也。爰錄之以饗閱者。</p>
<p>余治威海之明年春。植樹於城内奈古山之麓。遂登所謂環翠樓者。見其背枕羣山。岡陵四合。凌虚倒埀。萬家　次。浮空泛景。蕩若無外。對面爲劉公島。孤峯聳秀。柢柱中流。大海環其三面。劉公島若屏障焉。固天然之勝境。實海疆之奥區也。而回顧斯樓。則楝楹榱桶之腐黑。覆瓦級甎之破缺。盡墁不鮮。赤白漫濾。蓋荒廢失修者多歷年所矣。憑欄眺望。俶焉傷之。考威海之設衛。在明洪武季年。所以防海寇也。永樂間。始築城。厥後城池倒塌。巡察海道副使趙公鶴齡重治之。指揮王恒感趙公之德。捐廉俸建環翠樓。以示永久。大學士劉公　爲之記。淸順治間重修。康熙四十七年傾圯。乾隆元年復建。衛志之記斯樓始末者如此。夫自明初設衛防日。日知東北有備。遂變其侵略之策。擾我閩越邊鄙。迨光緒中葉。李公鴻章督畿輔。乃闢威海爲軍港。設海軍提督。駐紮劉公島。甲午之役。日人出奇制我。一面由遼藩進攻。一面潛師由成山登陸。據我威海。海軍遂退保無地。總兵鄧世昌戰敗死。提督丁汝昌仰藥殉。於是我東北之藩籬盡失。威海衛海灣幾爲日人所屬地。淸廷忍辱媾和割與臺灣索還威海。不三年英又强迫租借。爲其駐華海軍根據地。計自前淸光緒二十四年租借。至民國十九年交還。威海衛淪爲異域者凡三十有二年。余奉中央簡命。來守此邦。溯自明初迄今。威海有專城專官埀六百年。而環翠樓之高踞山巔爲威海衛名勝地者。亦幾五百年矣。今則　陊不修。撓折就圯。浸假崩棟塞路。荒葛　塗。有似乎鮑明遠之賦蕪城者。將使一方勝蹟。埋没於荒烟蔓草之中。固爲斯樓之不幸。抑亦守土者之不敏歟。爰於今歲七月。飭材鳩工。梓圬並舉。三閱月而落成。樓之中堂。舊祀趙公鶴齡。兹增奉丁公汝昌鄧公世昌木主焉。工將　事。適旅韓僑胞慘遭屠戳。其逃難乘輪回威海者數千人。舉國悲憤。敵愾同深。余夙隷海軍。近承專寄。俯仰今昔。哀感尤切。念自海禁大開。列强環同。沿江沿海。逐漸侵入。不獨威海一隅然也。即以威海論。爲防日而適爲日所據。終復被英所租。今雖脫離他族。光復故土。而東望旅大三韓。愴懷甲午已事。我海軍先烈在天之靈。仍難瞑目。兹者重加修治。增祀丁鄧二公。用示表彰前徽。崇拜忠烈。後之來者。其亦責無旁貸。有以禦海寇而雪國恥乎。海天無極。跛予望之。若謂愛其林壑之美。僅供作游覽之娱。又豈余重修斯樓之微意也哉。是爲記。</p>

<p>頃據友人說。「日本箱根富士星飯店的主人山口正三發起一個國際美髯大會。將在日本箱根開會。其動機是山口氏把日　報紙所登載的長岡外史照相。寄給美國李佛烈氏。並請李氏向世界長髯家介紹。經李氏介紹後。世界上以美髯自豪的人。爭要和長岡比賽。於是便有了國際美髯大會。德廢帝威廉第二和現在德總統興登堡。都有加入比賽之說」云。</p>

<p>— 張炎</p>
<p>溽暑無俚。偕友人方齋蓀君。遊太白祠歸來。爰爲斯紀。兼吿有山水癖者。</p>
<p>唐李靑蓮學士。夜遊采石。醉後投身江中捉月。去而不返。後傳爲騎鯨天上去。雖爲神話。然遺蹟尙留人間。攷采石屬安徽太平府當塗縣。濱臨大江。有磯頭突出江面。頗爲天險。亦爲古人用兵必爭之地。磯上有翠螺山。名勝頗多。如燃犀亭。即晉時温　燃犀處。仍有蛾眉亭。三淸觀。三官洞。及淸中興名臣彭楊李三專祠。最著者。爲太白祠。祠宇建來已久。有明成化重建。後與彭楊專祠同修。頗具畫棟雕梁之美。正殿供太白正身坐像。像貌淸奇。長鬚飄拂。御綠袍靑巾。前有謫仙樓。爲譚故院長所題。鏤有太白臥像。一杯在手。有舉杯邀明月之槪。旁侍二童。一持劍。一持壼。潚灑自然。相傳此像爲名手所作。故能神肖。淸彭雪琴有聯云『此處莫題詩。誰個能爲學士敵。』『江中頻捉月。我來甘拜酒仙狂。』每遊名勝。俗人每以俗筆塗鴉。大煞風景。故俗諺有放屁上高墻之譏。而太白祠中粉壁如新。竟無俗筆玷汚。豈班門弄斧。不敢題詩乎。可異也。翠螺山下有靑蓮衣冠墓。碑立自淸代道光時。現爲學校操場。任人踐踏。徒資憑弔而已。采石距首都九十里水程。小輪歷四時可逹。遊人頗爲便利也。</p>
<h3 id="c176">談警犬 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>歐洲各國的警察局裏。常有一種經過訓練的狗。用以帮助警察查緝罪犯以及找尋凶物之類。數十年來。成績極好</p>
<p>▲一警一狗　譬如在一個殺人的案件中。第一步的偵緝手績。就是先尋得了那凶器。而同時行兇者。常料到了這一層。行凶之後。必設法把那凶器毁滅。或者携帶至於遠地。兇器之找尋。於是大感困難。然而假使你有一條高明的警犬。那末它會嗅着氣味。循跡以往。不久之後。即可以查獲無誤。警犬功用之大。於此可見一斑。還有當一個警士獨行巡夜。或是隻身站崗時。一條警犬。尤不可少。犬性勇猛。且具忠忱。苟遇强徒。雖以手槍相向。亦不致畏却。有一條犬在乃好比有了三四個同伴。最近。英國有許多警犬專家。在「水晶宫」LrystlPalace開會。議决向政府提議。要竭力提倡警犬。使全國警士。每人有一條警犬而後已。</p>
<p>▲特種良犬　然而所謂警犬。必須經過長時期嚴格的訓練。方可置之實用。而警犬又非普通的狗即可充數。歐洲各國現在所用的。有一種特種良産。呌做「阿爾斯心種」。據說是最好的一種。阿爾斯心種的警犬。性情體質。固較他犬爲勇猛强健。而它又有專跟一人和非主人親飼不食的癖性。更適宜於警犬之資格。只要與它同居已久。它的心目中就只認識你一個人。將隨你一生。不再他去。只要你有規則的日常飼東西它吃。别人給它東西。它决不會呑食。警犬和警士一樣。日久樹敵必多。有此癖性。就可以絕對的避免他人之對它下毒。并且它有很强烈的記憶力。雖乘火車携之他處。亦能尋回故居不致迷失。除了阿爾斯心種外。其他尙有一種呌做「大譚」的。也很有充作警犬的資格。「大譚」爲英國的養狗專家司帝華君所發見近已從事於培殖。大約在不久的將來中。世界上的警犬。必可多得幾頭種哩。</p>

<p>— 陳以恩</p>
<p>法路易十六將登斷頭臺之際。狂笑不已。金聖嘆臨刑之際。大吟其詩。何以故。因過此數分鐘。再無復笑吟之機會。又可藉此一吟一笑以度此萬箭鑽心之一刹那也。</p>
<p>方今各地災民。未必盡淹於死地。其埀涕默嘆。號哭跳呌。如待决之囚。其慘苦爲何如者。鳴呼。天災人禍。出於倉卒。及身而遇之。亦惟有堅持「凡事愈紛亂愈鎭靜」之志識力以處之耳。非然者。手足將無所措。慘苦倍加焉。</p>
<p>災難中人。欲衣食住無所偏損。是必不可得。因衣食住之深感不周。而處事又復不鎭靜。窘損精神。搗亂思想。戕賊體力。縱天災人禍不足以死我。而亦淪於自殺矣。就水災而論。災民衣食住行。固無所恃。斯時也。迅雷暴風狂雨烈日兵變匪刦械鬥等天災人禍。必交迫而來。鼠咬虫傷。其少焉者矣。人們不幸而遭此際會。不但要效法金聖嘆與路易十六臨難時之狂吟縱笑。以舒一己之愁懷。以止他人之涕涙。從容而又勇往以求出路。衣食住更須惟力是視。務求比安適日飽暖。否則天災人禍逃得了。而癘疫瘟神又光降。眞逃不了矣。吾爲是說。非不近人情。苦中作樂。無量苦衷。在難及振災諸君。幸爲留意。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>初十日訪沙彌神信於一園中。木棉花盛開。此樹惟兩廣有之。高聳無枝葉。花紅鮮而大。亦有似垂楊之樹。條長葉大。此園爲富族所有。供養僧其本分也。每日四餐。打破過午不食之制。况神信久遊歐美。誠如太虚師所云新僧矣。但余以爲此新僧太好學。目近視已甚。而終日不釋卷。頃正讀甘地自傳。此傳余曾介紹其上卷。兹復略觀其下卷兩厚册。下卷之厚猶之上卷。余不能細看也。余非書中　魚。不願多看畫矣。其自傳中屢述得力印度敎經典格逹一書之事。又述淡食衛生之經騐。與余往年所著粗食猛健法之旨略同。惟對於印人護牛律及回人殺牛兩族衝突事。無善法調處。余深思之。亦無善法也。抑牛之問題。誠難解决。而余以爲印人道德可取。即在此一點。蓋實信人之性不如牛之性者也。人類難云有良心較有良心者。其印度人哉。甘地自傳歸宿於神爲結論。則非余所知也。要之甘地乃婆羅門敎之道領。過於託爾士太爲新耶敎之首領也。夕陽西下余隨沙彌遊後園。蓋濱恒河也。沙彌目短視甚。足亦不良下河堤。扶余肩而行。印人望見一華人扶持一印僧甚怪。余來拜佛無佛。印僧即佛之代表矣。余甚喜禮之也。余不能信神爲實有。余亦不信天助善人。然於各敎之人皆親之。順其習慣耳。余非信何種敎。信其爲人類之人而已。故彼之所敬亦敬順之也。河中小艇往來。多有中年以上婦女來禮恒水者。望見沙彌皆舉手爲禮。印度之船。略與中國同。但余念及上海長江各地。船上危險盗賊之事。令余心悸。中國賊船太多。惟在兩廣船有婦人爲主者。余心頗安。比余歸校。則見羣牛出入校中。蓋印度各校皆有牛。牛爲神爲公共之乳母也。世界上有良心之人類。只印度人矣。印度文化大白牛之文化也。則牛之出入大學。不其宜哉。</p>

<p>▲南巿襄路到貨依然不少河積稍有、鄉城店銷乃因新閘較廉、胃口均屬淸淡、各思削價擇取、是以厚粳行情短夫三尺、但近午成交略夥後形或有轉定未奇、早晚稻貨則稍有、寗銷不振、本街去化亦揀鮮暴、致價又修二尺、迨後雖覺轉好、惟價不易喝起、巿形仍内堅外軟之勢、後到必稀蘆洋尖貨雖不多、奈銷不暢、致價逐疲、陰化胃仍滯細價見跟修、白元乏貨、</p>
<p>▲新閘昨日河下斛脚常錫等厚粳較前平懈、故客方乘此檔口拔鬆、形勢難以站定、蘆洋尖受洋米影響開盤降縮一尺、石浦·重固等薄稻來貨十數號、交易揀頂而動次色西塘貨所軋、頗爲呆滯、價軟二尺糯米食品店需路尙殷、形勢趨緊、洋米到積薄弱、客帮稍動、惟本街呆化形呈暫定、</p>

<p>— 愛卿</p>
<p>爪哇印象之四</p>
<p>在半開化民族國度裏的博物館是文明國家愛好古董的人士所不注意的自爪哇亡國之後在民間所不輕易見的東西也被荷蘭政府搬到博物館去陳列了而且還有文明各國的一些有歷史和藝術價値的古物點綴在其中各種珍寶和古董都分門别類的各放在一間陳列室裏以便參觀者任意鑑賞</p>
<p>館中所陳列之物以爪哇王宫之珍寶奇珠爲最多有國王五百年以前所用之寶刀寶劍相傳寶刀寳劍爲國王傳其子孫專用他人有握柄頭　的神話刀柄刀套劍套均係數百顆大小鑽石嵌成寳光四射使人不能久視一頂古王冠高若尺許重有七磅用赤金鑄成冠上嵌鑲寳石明珠無數據識寳商人所談以館中一頂王冠可値荷幣百萬以上王后之藏寳箱中有酒盃大小的鑽石瑪瑙琥珀明珠珍寳各種各色發出燦爛的異光使參觀者稱羡不已天南乃明珠之國誠不虚傳</p>
<p>在另一間陳列室裏完全陳設歷史的王袍妃衣朝服鐵甲戰袍戈袍戈矛和木石等兵器亦有數百年前用樹皮椰葉織成的王袍這些遺物很容易引起人追懷我國數千年以前的物質文化</p>
<p>全館中以各國歷代的錢幣雕刻織工磁器陶器等佔三分之一亦有我國漢唐時的錢幣與磁器陳列在其中進博物館觀覽的人士頗能飽其眼福</p>
<p>現在聽說荷蘭政府有擴大博物館的計劃擬請考古專家專收買歐美及遠東各國的古董奇珍添置館中的陳設將來或許不會落於文明國家的博物館之後吧</p>
<h3 id="c216">最近墨莎里尼 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 高宗元譯</p>
<p>今日的墨莎里尼和法希世蒂初起時的狄克推多幾乎是判若兩人</p>
<p>意相墨莎里尼的丰采也許比了好萊塢一個最享盛名的銀星的丰采更要馳譽當世吧一提起墨莎里尼的大名普通人的眼簾前就會引起一個混合拿破倫愷撤和一個正在竭力使個頑抗的病人入睡的催眠術者的影像發着銅色般目光的一對眸子盛氣人地的一臉怒色和一個氣昻昻雄糾糾的態度這些要算得這個影象是顯著底特色了可是任你把幾年前的墨莎里尼底容貌描摹到如何樣的確切今日的墨莎里尼較之昔日的墨莎里尼是大不相同了說句實話墨莎里尼自從執了八九年的國政以來已經柔化了許許多多哩尖銳的稜角早因常常實施外交而漸漸地消磨掉他的人生觀和常人的不同他是從一個居於指揮羣倫的地位的人底觀點去觀人生他的外觀因此而受到影響同時他的態度也漸漸地緩和下來現在他的身材也大大的加高了</p>
<p>他的得處於今日的地位是由於革命八年前是以一個革命領袖不但在事實方面是個革命領袖即在他的心理的組織上在他對當時萬物的偏執的厭惡上和他那時革新·變更·發展·和改良的急切上也稱得是一個革命領袖現在八個年頭已經過去已經急匆匆地過去了八載的勳業也跟着去了僅僅遺留着牠們的痕跡而已</p>
<p>墨莎里尼生理上的特點也許是改變得最少他仍舊當他那稍微凸出的灼灼睜視的眼晴他那不整齊的牙牀和大龔然自大的神態好久以前曾見到墨莎里尼的一張舊像片那是他家的一張合家歡的照相就在他初得孩子後攝的他槪是在十八九年前了罷照那像片所示他的夫人坐着懷裏抱着一個呌愛黛的嬰孩墨莎里尼就立在背後那時候他尙不過是一家社會主義派的新聞紙名Ａvantia的一個没没無名的編緝罷了那時的他對於那含辛茹苦的文墨生涯比了當個狄克推多的職位要熟練得多哩</p>
<p>然而他的外貌他的凸頦。他那拿翁式的神態和現在當他檢閱法希世蒂民軍時或當他接受那殷殷仰望的大衆底彩聲時所顯露出來的神態是絲毫無異他那居高臨下赫赫不可一世的氣槪顯然是出乎自然而並不是他矯飾出來的結果所改觀的並非是他的眼睛却是他眼睛裏所發射出來的光罷了</p>
<p>有得多初次見識墨莎里尼的人往往覺得驚詫怎麽這樣一個人物能和常人一般的彬彬有禮呢因他們的腦海裏已深刻着普通人對於墨莎里尼的觀念以爲他是這樣地傲然自大的一種人物當他們感到他是充滿了人類所有的仁慈他能笑談到使人愉快他能說同情於人家的話他並不殘忍地置人家的意見於不顧他且樂於找求人家的忠吿換句話說他是一個合乎情的人使人覺得更奇怪了</p>
<p>凡是登門求謁而被引進他著名的辦公室凱旋堂的人大都準備着忍受一種嚴酷的刑罰就是在他那緊緊夾攏着的眉頭和注視着的冷酷的眼光下穿過那宏大的房間關於這種令人毛骨悚然的情感人們談論得多了文章也作得不少哩所以人們在事前早料到了但是現在的情形却一反從前無論怎樣都好登門過訪的人大槪都被　個短短的肥胖的人穿着潔白無疵一塵不染的晨服一條條條紋的褲子鈕孔裏還插着一枝花兒小心翼翼地在門口迎接着他善氣迎人地伸出一隻手來當他伴同他們行經那房間而請他們坐下來時他摯誠地笑着來訪的客人起初往往想不到這個和藹可親的主人就是他們所久已望影悚然的墨莎里尼啊</p>
<p>他的談話也並不像一般人所料的那樣進行他並不靜悄悄地默坐在寫字檯後時時帶着像一個嚴師對一個頑童訓誡時的神態高聲突然發問他很是可愛他全神貫注地並處處表示他强烈的興趣聽來客所說的話他很機敏而流利的答覆他們的問題</p>
<p>有一個墨莎里尼曾坐着讓他寫照過的美國著名畫家甚至於在我面前稱頌他爲他一生所交接過的人士中最彬彬有禮的一人</p>
<p>墨莎里尼的變異除了在他的演說裏頭外再没有其他地方最可以表顯出來了當他初執政時他是全歐政治家中最固執的一個並且是演說次數最多的演說家中的一個他從不肯錯過一個可以起而演說的機會他的演詞大槪以牠的膽略和言詞的猛烈見稱而並非以其藴義深奥見長他的演說能設法使聽衆爲之屏息寂靜而並不用理論來服人他用恫嚇的話要比論辯之詞來得多光陰像比一般的流去他的演說也跟着日見减少了現在他的演詞是經細細地思考後始出口得其效果於其所根據的原理而並非靠了像放烟水般天花亂墜的演說術了他已學着到了有重要談話發表時才說並且他的演說現已再意地得到從前所不能得到的效果了</p>
<p>墨莎里尼演說的式樣實際上是毫未改變過他演說時往往有很多不合拉丁民族的地方那些意大利演說家所最鍾愛的美麗的詞句他是難得一用的他用能使人人都懂得的普通話說他所要說的話他並不使用曲折複雜的句子或是難以而瞭的譬喩至於身體的動作他用得更少他並不搖動他的手臂像普通拉丁民族人民所做慣了的或靠了裝腔作態使人感動他時常用他的右手作個急速的埀直的舉動來着重他演說中的一點祗是極難得的見過他擊着桌子以壯聲勢然而他一般的能得到他所預期的效果他有一種特殊的吸引力可使他的聽衆着魔他不用一般意大利演說家所慣用的粉飾的詞句或是華麗的張喩而能使他們狂喜熱烈逹於極點</p>
<p>當他在露天對大衆演說時他是竭盡其力了他的語音充塞了那最大的空間他對羣衆心理學似乎有充分的瞭解我曾見過保洛匿那裏絕大的一片曠場上擠滿了幾十萬的人對他們他有能力去感動……他能使聽衆如醉如痴地的熱烈我使他們鴉雀無聲地的寂靜一個一代偉人而能左右萬衆的情感這眞是一個令人嘆異的也眞是一個令人心折的啊</p>
<p>墨莎里尼現在是極難得在露天作演說了他時常對法希世蒂民軍或在法希世蒂省黨部中的主要人物的會議席上或當着幾個工商業或諸如此類的代表團前演說但這些幾乎都是私人的集會普通民衆是不許參與的從前他慣喜將民衆召集攏來到他辦公室的窗下他自己從洋台上向他們大聲演說在那裏他幾乎喪失性命當他的前任代表柴尼保尼拿着一枝來福槍在附近的一個窗口對他試行射擊的時候現在他不再這般做了他一切含有政治性質的演詞都在上議院裏或内閣裏或在法希世蒂大議事廳的私室裏發表近年來他的演說在口氣上都有分寸並且完全消失他從前可以示别的特色不久以前當他對着一個約計四千人的法希世蒞省黨部的主要人物——代表意大利全國法西法希世蒞黨參謀本部的——演說時若在舊時他就要以此當作一個可以使對分敵人猛烈攻擊的天賜的好機會可是他只限於把法希世蒂黨以往八年中的功績作一個嚴格的批評而已</p>
<p>從一部最新出版的他的一九二八年全年的演說集裏可以見到他在那一年中所作演說共約四十次其中只有兩篇演詞是有政治性質的且都是關於外國的政治一篇是曾在内閣裏頭發表過另一篇曾在議院裏發表過其餘都是些短篇的演詞——往往只有寥寥的幾句話——或在國會開幕時發表過或在公共建築物初次奠基時發表或在歡迎代表席上發表過或在舉行幾個同樣的典禮時發表過</p>
<h3 id="c217">法將福煦歐戰日記 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>山特爾之戰一九一八年八月八日至十二日</p>
<p>一九一八年八月八日上午四點鐘在繼續籠罩着昨夜的準備的迷霧之中我軍砲隊開始猛烈的轟擊擊毁了敵軍的砲位英第四軍的步兵和坦克即在砲擊四十五分鐘之後出壕進攻</p>
<p>敵軍爲我攻擊猛烈和迅速猝不及防在極混亂之中潰退遺棄無數的輜重我軍當天進展六哩以上戰線十二哩開闊我軍在山特爾高原得着了穏固的立足地擒獲俘虜一萬三千人大砲三百尊現已到乘勝進攻的時機台狄克上校因此奉令在九日晨把下面的軍書傳送狄朋尼軍長</p>
<p>你當然知道法第一軍應即從速進至勞義同第三軍聯絡聯絡旣成則依形勢的推移自可進行第二步正因吾人今日不能確實决定應採何種動作所以一切當隨機應變絕對不許把任何師軍隊調往後方萬一不能再行前進的隊伍可配置在第二線以作聲援行軍須神速以後方所有的兵力掩獲緊向前線進兵直至逹到了計劃中的目的而後已倘使完成了這步工作種種損失幾天之後便可避免了</p>
<p>未幾我見狄朋尼軍長因其右翼在孟鐵第歐下首渡阿夫爾河遇着困難遂又傳令給他</p>
<p>狄朋尼軍長旣經確定其行軍的樞紐在孟鐵第歐的彼岸必不可忽略在阿夫爾河右岸沿着勞義路進行的一翼便是同英軍（即較强的軍隊）聯絡之點這裏他須親自指揮尤其須注意於第三十一聯隊積極向勞義挺進那裏便是他的英雄用武之地</p>
<p>九日法英聯軍又有極大的進展敵軍見着南北兩面均已被圍遂於次晚退出孟鐵第歐</p>
<p>十日繼續進攻即在沙姆河之北布萊方面又向南在歇爾納和勞義方面奪得許多陣地</p>
<p>法第三軍依次奉了福悅司令的命令加入戰事因他自八月五日以來早已料到法英聯軍這次進攻很爲有利遂令第三軍準備在第一軍的右翼參戰第三軍向拉西尼出動</p>
<p>聯帥因即於十日把下面的軍令傳送各軍司令</p>
<p>一英第四軍和法第一軍繼續東向亨姆方面前進—英軍以逹到亨姆之下沙姆河準備渡河爲目標同時繼續從布萊方面渡河至坡龍法軍則掩護英軍前進以巨斯卡—亨姆路爲目標</p>
<p>二法第三軍現正向拉西尼—諾昻進兵緊隨法第一軍肅淸孟鐵第歐以及諾昻區域的殘敵</p>
<p>三海格元帥從速準備英第三軍向巴布姆和坡龍方面作戰以撼敵軍防線並趕緊乘隙進取</p>
<p>我軍在沙姆河左岸順利挺進軍行甚速喘息未定或遇着敵軍嚴密防守的障碍必有不得已而停頓的一日因須在沙姆河右岸和阿篤亞方面佈置軍事以便這時機一到即可着手接戰我十日的軍令裏面因加上第三段</p>
<p>十日晨我往訪海格元帥向他解釋英軍戰事向沙姆河之北和阿爾拉方面擴展的意思這樣我軍的戰績一面不致因局部的戰事而犧牲一面可以連續的勝利使敵軍應付的計劃發生混亂對着敵軍的弱點給以新打擊根本上動搖敵軍的抵抗力這更於聯軍有利這些軍事即應着手準備</p>
<p>但現在不斷的進攻了三天法英聯軍突然遇着頑强的抗抵敵軍今又逹到一九一四年的舊陣地且似已决心堅守</p>
<p>八月十一日英第四軍和法第一軍的左翼除了阿夫爾河和沙姆河之間稍有發展外不能再進法第三第一兩軍的右翼雖向拉西尼方面大有進展也是無濟於事</p>
<p>我力勸海格元帥積極向布萊方面挺進十一日晚我親自往訪請他再用全力作戰但在次日我在分送英法兩總司令的信裏說明必須採用新戰術以逹到我軍在沙姆河同疴亞斯河間的目標即擊退沙姆河的敵軍及奪取亨姆方面和亨姆之下沙姆河的全部橋樑信的内容如下</p>
<p>敵軍頑抗我軍萬萬不可全線同時進攻這種戰略足使我軍全線哀弱我軍應向重要的幾點集中兵力猛力一擊—換句話說就是那幾點奪取之後足使敵軍瓦解更須搗亂敵軍的交通路線這些軍事因須從速佈置並須調集最利於攻堅的兵力如坦克砲隊步兵</p>
<p>作戰的步驟如下</p>
<p>（甲）從速法第一軍和英第四軍的右翼合力進攻以奪取勞義周圍的路網爲目標法第三軍向南掩護以肅淸諾昻區域爲目的</p>
<p>（乙）無延誤英第四軍的中路從列宏海爾附近向西北進攻以奪取亞眠通布里之路爲目標至少須置該路在野砲砲火範圍之内英第四軍的左翼向東協助</p>
<p>爲擴充我軍這次攻勢戰的範圍起見我加上下面一點</p>
<p>攻擊擴展到兩翼—沙姆河之北和疴亞斯河之東—可以增加戰績其計劃如下、（未完）</p>

<p>Liu Ruiheng and his party arrive in Hankou.</p>
<p>New record for the Yangtze River water level.</p>
<p>(Hankou) At 6:00 AM on the 19th, over three zhang of the abandoned Wu Li embankment near Zhanggong Ancestral Hall below Xujiapeng in Wuchang collapsed, creating a severe situation. Currently, except for higher ground in the city, all other areas are flooded. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Wu Guozhen departed for Nanjing on the Fenghe Wheel at 9:00 PM on the 19th. His tasks include: (1) reporting the disaster situation to the Central Government; (2) appealing to the Central Government and fellow townsmen in Nanjing to raise relief funds. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Ruiheng arrived in Hankou by plane on the 18th to inspect the disaster and epidemic prevention efforts. Specialists from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Transportation, along with Westerners, accompanied him. They are staying at the YMCA. The Municipal Government has assigned the Municipal Hospital Director, Li Boren, to receive them and has scheduled a banquet for the evening of the 20th. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Water Conservancy Bureau is responsible for all flood prevention work on the embankments near Hankou. However, the level of danger on all sides is increasing. Many of the earthworkers hired by the Water Conservancy Bureau have been fleeing one after another. There are no earthworkers left on the Huangjing Hall and Chuanhan Hall embankments. The authorities have issued strict orders that any earthworkers who flee will be shot. (19th Electric Communication Society Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The National Government has sent American consultant Baker and others to Hankou to inspect the flood situation and investigate methods for rescuing disaster victims and providing food. This group of consultants arrived in Hankou by plane on the evening of the 18th. After inspecting the serious flooding in Wuhan, he said to the Electric Communication Society reporter who visited him that there was no way to help. He sighed repeatedly as he spoke. He went on to say that the Wuhan flood situation was very different from what he had heard and that the severity of the disaster was beyond imagination and that there was no concrete plan to save the people in the disaster area. Regarding the flooding on the Yangtze River, he said that the damage downstream from Zhenjiang was not very significant. However, upstream from Nanjing, the Yangtze River had widened by ten miles, and near Jiujiang, it had widened to more than twenty miles. It was an endless expanse of water, and the water level was rising daily. The consequences were unimaginable. The damage in various places was many times greater than imagined, truly unprecedented. (19th Electric Communication Society Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) As of 8:00 PM on the 18th, the Yangtze River water level reached a new record of 53 feet 7 inches. Several sections of the embankments in Wuhan had successively collapsed. The floodwaters rushed from the breaches into the suburbs and the city, with turbulent and unstoppable waves. The railway lines where hundreds of thousands of disaster victims were seeking refuge were flooded to a depth of four or five feet, and countless people drowned. Many disaster victims climbed onto freight cars and rooftops on the railway, but there was no space left. Those who could not climb up stretched their necks out of the water, wailing for help. The Chinese authorities were helpless and could only sigh in frustration. Moreover, the railway lines themselves were in danger of collapsing. If they did collapse, hundreds of thousands of lives would be in peril. (19th Electric Communication Society Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Wuchang. Wuchang originally made use of the old city to build strong flood prevention works, so the city itself was not flooded. However, since yesterday, several breaches have occurred in nearby embankments, and the turbid currents have rushed into the city, reaching a depth of four feet, causing chaos. The disaster victims who had fled from Hankou to Wuchang were now suffering another flood, with no place to escape. (19th Electric Communication Society Telegram)</p>

<p>Beating and Insulting Chinese People, Fabricating Excuses to Shirk Responsibility</p>
<p>(Qingdao) At around 8:00 PM on the 18th, Meng Jirei, a worker at Yong Shunli Company on Huantai Road, was chatting with Liu in front of the gate of Japanese businessman Shima Masaaki on Liaoning Road. Shima forcibly drove him away. Meng reasoned with him, but was brutally beaten. When a Chinese policeman stepped forward to mediate, he was also injured with an iron rod. Shima then reported to the Kokusuikai by phone and invited hundreds of thugs, wielding knives and clubs, to attack anyone they saw and to guard both ends of the road, cutting off traffic. Upon hearing the news, the Municipal Government immediately sent a security team to the scene to suppress the situation. Ten Chinese people were seriously injured and taken to the Municipal Hospital. Several of them were in danger of dying due to excessive blood loss. More than 30 people were slightly injured and returned home for self-treatment. The injured Japanese were sent to Qingdao Hospital. In addition to telegraphing the Central Government, the Municipal Government asked the Japanese Consul to send personnel to investigate jointly and invited German doctor Wei Shiying as a notary. First, they went to the Municipal Hospital to check, and then they went to Qingdao Hospital to examine the Japanese injuries. The Japanese side initially claimed that only a few people were injured, but then fabricated that 30 people were injured, and even refused Chinese reporters to participate. Japanese newspapers issued extra editions and made counter-propaganda. A general meeting of Japanese residents was held on the afternoon of the 19th, and they telegraphed their country to send two warships, which are expected to arrive tonight. The Municipal Government protested to the Japanese Consulate at 4:00 PM on the 19th. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Last night, some Chinese people attacked a Japanese ice shop on Panyang Road, injuring 20 Japanese and Koreans. Some Chinese people were also injured, but none seriously. The cause was very minor. Initially, a Chinese fish seller bought ice from the ice shop and paid with a one-jiao banknote. The shop owner, Shima, refused to accept it because the banknote was broken. They argued and dispersed. On Tuesday evening, the fish seller returned to the shop, accusing the shopkeeper of packing the ice carelessly, causing it to fall on the road and injure his foot. He demanded compensation. He first argued with the Chinese workers in the shop, and then the shop owner, Shima, became angry and hit the fish seller with his shoe. Passersby stopped to watch. At that time, someone picked up a stone and broke the glass window of the shop. Shima was a member of a certain Japanese association. A few minutes later, members of the same association arrived with knives, swords, clubs, and sticks to drive away the crowd, which aroused public outrage and gathered more and more people, who then fought each other, injuring many people on both sides, but no one died. Within two hours of the incident, the police had completely restored order, and the Municipal Bureau Fire Brigade also arrived at the scene to assist in the suppression. Rumors were rampant outside, many exaggerating the situation, making it difficult to get the truth. However, inquiries at the hospital revealed that only ten people were being treated in the hospital. It is generally believed that the Chinese authorities are handling this case very seriously. However, the Japanese side said that the Japanese residences on Shenyang Road and Boshan Road suffered heavy damage and affected innocent people. They are holding a meeting this afternoon to protest to the Chinese authorities. It is reported that a Japanese warship is now sailing from Lushunkou to this place. It is truly unfortunate that such a small matter has caused serious resentment between the people of the two countries.</p>

Several people were seriously injured. One person was taken away by the Japanese and is still missing. The injured on our side were sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment.

<h3 id="e43">Discussion of Fundamental Issues in Education Going Forward (Part 2) <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Only the brave can acknowledge the truth of facts. Only the wise can find a way out from the facts. Now, let us elaborate on the three issues raised in yesterday's commentary, with statements of facts and reasons. This is not to deliberately find fault or nitpick. The true intention is to seek a broad and open path forward from the truth of past events.</p>
<p>The central meaning of the first issue is to hope that those responsible for education will value education and have a sense of responsibility. In terms of facts, most past school enrollments were either "routine" or "for the school." What is meant by "routine"? The lifeblood of a school is the students who pass through it year after year. Therefore, when one class of old students graduates and leaves the school, a class of new students should be recruited to fill their places, renewing the student body to extend the school's life indefinitely. However, the question is whether, before enrolling students, there was any consideration of what kind of talent society needs, what kind of opportunities students can have, how to teach, and how to ensure that students receive real educational benefits. If someone can answer these questions sincerely and responsibly, we dare say that only one or two out of a hundred schools have ever considered the above issues before enrolling students. This is "routine," that is, enrolling students and teaching according to routine. Old students graduate and leave as usual, and new students are recruited as usual. A cyclical routine, a routine cycle. Apart from routine, neither the educators nor the students have any sense of responsibility for "recruiting" or "attending." What is meant by "for the school"? On the 18th of this month, Mr. Zhu Jingnong said in his speech to the academic lecture group of the World Society in Beiping, "There are many private universities that adopt the principle of 'accepting anyone who comes' when enrolling students, relying entirely on student tuition fees." He also said, "There is a certain university where students can graduate after studying for one year." Mr. Zhu is the former Vice Minister of Education, so his words are credible. Is the motivation for enrollment for the students, for society, for the nation, or for the school? Clear-sighted people can answer this question themselves. Enrolling students according to routine is irresponsible. Enrolling students for the school is to commercialize the school and turn students into raw materials. "Routine" enrollment and "for the school" enrollment do no harm to the school authorities and may even be beneficial. However, how will they benefit society in the future? How will they benefit the students in the future? This is why the reporter raised the first issue.</p>
<p>The central meaning of the second issue is to hope that education can be universal and not continue to develop in a distorted manner. Why do we say this? In recent times, the rural economy of our country has been declining, with middle peasants and above gradually going bankrupt, and those below middle peasants finding it even more difficult to survive. However, on the other hand, the cost of education is high, with primary school costing tens of gold yuan per year, middle school costing two or three hundred gold yuan, and university costing even five or six hundred gold yuan. A gate built of gold, only the children of the upper classes in the cities can cross. Those who are gradually going bankrupt may even send their children to school by cutting into their own flesh, but few of them can avoid dropping out halfway. Even fewer can complete secondary education. As for the poor masses who cannot survive, they can only look up in awe and sigh at the dragon gate for the rest of their lives, and for the rest of their children's and grandchildren's lives. Therefore, not long ago, there was a father in Shanghai who died to apologize for being unable to raise tuition fees for his son. Therefore, more than 80 percent of the country's population is illiterate. What could be more unfair than this? What could have a greater impact than this? This year, disasters have spread across the country, and people are even more destitute and homeless. However, school enrollment continues as usual. Has any attention been paid to the social strata from which the students come? Some may say that this is the responsibility of the government and not something that schools can attend to. Yes, but no. Improving the social system and improving educational administration to ensure that all citizens have the opportunity to receive education is the government's responsibility. We will put that aside for now. To seek possible opportunities for the poor students who can be cultivated to pursue their studies to the best of our ability is the responsibility of the school authorities. With a solemn appearance, one can only see wealthy and affluent students entering school, and the bitter faces of poor parents and brothers are not seen. The weeping of poor children is not heard. Then education is not for the public but is privately owned by a few. Education is showing its defects. This is why the reporter raised the second issue.</p>

<p>Commercial Negotiations Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>Poland to Have Serious Reactions</p>
<p>▲ *Guomin News Agency,* London, 18th. News received here today indicates that representatives of France and Soviet Russia in Paris have drafted a non-aggression treaty, which has been initialed by both parties. The treaty stipulates that if one of the two countries is attacked by a third country without having initiated hostilities, the other country shall maintain strict neutrality. The treaty shall also be effective if France or Soviet Russia is attacked jointly by several countries without having initiated hostilities. According to reports, negotiations began in Paris in May, and later, French Foreign Minister Briand and Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov also initialed the treaty in Geneva. With this formal signing, the almost continuous tension between France and Russia since the European War can be considered to have come to an end. It is also reported that negotiations on a temporary commercial treaty between the two countries are proceeding smoothly. It is also learned that the Russians secretly notified Germany when negotiating this treaty, so Germany will not be surprised when it hears the news of the signing by both parties. However, it is expected that Poland will have serious reactions.</p>
<p>▲ *Guomin News Agency,* Paris, 18th. The Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Economic Council of Soviet Russia, Max Levitsky, who recently arrived in France, told guests that Russia plans to order 200 million francs worth of goods from France, but must have credit for at least two or three years. The French government has not yet expressed its attitude, but it is reported that if the French government does not bear 70% of the credit for Soviet Russian purchases, bankers and industrialists will not be willing to take the risk of agreeing.</p>

<p>Due to Inability to Cope with Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>▲ *Guomin News Agency,* Hungarian Capital, 19th. The Hungarian cabinet suddenly resigned en masse late yesterday. The Regent accepted the resignation and instructed Prime Minister Count Pál Teleki to continue to handle affairs as usual before the new cabinet is formed. It is now expected that Teleki will still be ordered to try to form a new cabinet. According to informed sources, the resignation of the Hungarian cabinet is likely related to financial matters, as the old cabinet has so far been unable to obtain foreign loans to cope with the financial difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Illegal Trade in Narcotics <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Has Not Decreased in the Slightest</p>
<p>▲ *Reuters,* London, 18th. Reports from British consuls and the United States, Egypt, and other countries regarding the seizure of narcotics indicate that illegal trade in narcotics in 1930 has not decreased in the slightest. According to a report by the British government to the League of Nations, illegal trade in Shangen in the Far East is still worrying. Recently, someone in Japan inquired with a London merchant about the possibility of transporting 1,400 kilograms of heroin to Shanghai, which shows the scale of the illegal trade in narcotics. The British government's report to the League of Nations calls attention to the difficulty of requesting the issuance of export licenses for narcotics to be transported to China for medical purposes, because as far as is currently known, the Chinese law stipulating that import licenses must be issued by the Ministry of Interior and the Opium Prohibition Commission after consultation has not yet been implemented. If the Chinese government has concrete statements explaining the approval procedures for issuing import licenses, the work of the British Home Office in handling the transport of narcotics to China will be greatly facilitated.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Committee of International Bankers Signs Report of British Representative <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Urging Relevant Governments to Substantially Assist Germany</p>
<p>Difficult to Convert Short-Term Loans into Long-Term Loans</p>
<p>▲ *Guomin News Agency,* Basel, 19th. The Committee of International Bankers reached a final agreement on the issue of extending short-term loans to Germany before dawn today and signed the report. The report is 21 pages long and has eight appendices. The committee has agreed to extend short-term loans to Germany until February 19 next year. Regarding the Mark deposits of banks in various countries, 20% can be withdrawn immediately, and the remainder can only be withdrawn gradually depending on financial conditions. The Deutsche Bank is authorized to supervise and control the process. The report warned the governments of relevant countries of the need to quickly implement a plan to assist Germany in safely weathering the crisis, and not to delay and cause all countries to be affected. Regarding the conversion of short-term loans into long-term loans, the report stated that considering Germany's political situation and financial burden as a whole, this move does not seem feasible. Because Germany's relations with other European countries are neither based on friendly cooperation nor on mutual trust, it is difficult to expect progress if this does not change. From an international perspective, the contradictory phenomenon of wanting debtors to repay huge sums while erecting high tariff barriers to prevent commerce, making it practically impossible for debtors to meet their obligations, is also an obstacle to converting to long-term loans.</p>
<p>▲ *Reuters,* Chicago, 18th. *The Chicago Daily News* today published special dispatches from London and Basel, stating that Norman, the President of the Bank of England, is traveling to Canada for medical reasons, but his final destination is actually New York, hoping to convert the current £48 million in three-month bank debt owed to France and the United States into debt owed solely to the United States, with the debt amount remaining unchanged but the term extended. It is almost impossible for the Bank of England to repay this short-term debt owed to France and the United States without affecting the stability of the gold pound. Norman's goal is to repay this short-term debt on the one hand and convert the 5% war bonds to 4% on the other, so that interest can be saved and the British budget can be slightly lighter. The above is a report from *The Chicago Daily News,* but banking circles say they are unaware of this action, and officials from the Federal Reserve Bank are unwilling to comment on the matter.</p>

<p>Totaling 37 Billion Marks</p>
<p>France Receives 50%</p>
<p>▲ *Guomin News Agency,* Berlin, 18th. Local newspapers published articles criticizing the remarks of French Finance Minister Flandin. Official sources indicated tonight that, according to German statistics, Germany has paid a total of 68 billion marks in cash and goods since the armistice. However, according to statistics from American experts, Germany paid a total of 26 billion marks before the implementation of the Dawes Plan. Since then, Germany has paid a total of 8 billion marks after the implementation of the Dawes Plan, and another 2.7 billion marks from the implementation of the Young Plan to the Hoover Plan, totaling 37 billion marks. France received 52%, or 18.5 billion marks. France used 100 billion francs, or 16.7 billion marks, to rebuild the war zone.</p>

<p>To Study Economic Proposals of the Committee</p>
<p>Inaccurate Report that Baldwin Left France and Returned to England</p>
<p>▲ *Reuters,* London, 19th. The Cabinet has convened a meeting to listen to economic proposals, which is expected to last until late at night.</p>
<p>▲ *Reuters,* London, 19th. The five-member Economic Committee met today and was busy all day. It only finished discussing in the evening. Reuters has learned that Prime Minister MacDonald and others have agreed on the methods to submit to the full Cabinet meeting at 11:00 tomorrow morning. The contents are being kept secret for now. The committee adjourned in the evening, which surprised many, as it was initially expected that the committee would not be able to finish its work until late at night. After the full Cabinet meeting approves the committee's plan, detailed methods will be notified to Conservative Party's Neville Chamberlain and Liberal Party's Samuel. The major event on Thursday will be a meeting between cabinet members and three important organs of the Labor Party. MacDonald and Henderson will both attend and speak. News came from Paris in the evening that Conservative Party leader Baldwin had returned to England from France, but it is now known to be inaccurate. Baldwin is still in France and has not returned.</p>
<p>▲ *Reuters,* London, 19th. The Labor Party's newspaper this morning stated that the Economic Committee will propose the following to the full Cabinet meeting: (1) a tithe tax; (2) a suspension of the Debt Reduction Fund; (3) a special tax on securities with a certain interest rate.</p>

<p>▲ *Guomin News Agency,* New York, 18th. During the Chinese drought last year, American philanthropists organized the China Famine Relief Committee and appointed White as the chairman. After the Chinese government established the National Flood Relief Committee, the committee telegraphed White asking for his assistance. Today, White has suggested to the Federal Bureau of Agriculture and the Grain Stabilization Corporation that they sell wheat to China on credit, with the quantity based on China's needs for purchase. The repayment period would be between ten and twenty years, with no interest or a very low interest rate that has never been seen before. According to White, the Grain Stabilization Corporation currently has 1.25 million tons of wheat in storage. White said that American public opinion strongly supports using surplus wheat to relieve the disaster in China.</p>

<p>▲ Negotiations Regarding the Japanese Garrison Surrounding the Public Security Bureau, Andong Correspondence: In recent years, the Japanese side has cited insufficient troop strength along the Anfeng Railway line and the difficulty in ensuring comprehensive protection for travelers as pretexts to autonomously increase troops. They have established a main base in Lianshanguan, with garrisons stationed at various large and small stations along the line to protect the railway. However, incidents between China and Japan have since increased. There have been frequent reports of Chinese civilians along the line being beaten and humiliated by Japanese soldiers for inadvertently stepping on the railway tracks. Recently, on the morning of the 10th, over sixty soldiers from the Japanese garrison stationed at Benxihu Station, led by their captain, marched with loaded rifles to a village near Shiqiaozi Station (Shiqiaozi is a small station along the Anfeng Railway line; the Sixth Branch of the Benxi County Public Security Bureau is located there, sixty li from Benxihu Station, separated by Dalianzhai Station). They surrounded the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau on all sides, creating a menacing atmosphere and prohibiting officials and police officers from entering or exiting. At this time, the bureau chief protested to the Japanese military and ordered them to withdraw, but the Japanese military refused and continued the encirclement. The bureau chief then reported the situation to the Benxi County Government by telephone and negotiated with the Japanese side. It was not until around midnight that the encircling Japanese military received orders to withdraw. The reason for the Japanese military's encirclement was that three days prior, a villager named Wang Qifu from Shicunzi, who made a living as a farmer, had a verbal argument with his father over a minor matter. Wang, in a fit of anger, left home and inadvertently stepped onto the railway tracks outside the village. A patrolling garrison unit passed by, subdued Wang, beat him severely, tied him with ropes, and took him back to their unit. Wang, unable to bear the suffering, took the opportunity to escape at great risk. The garrison unit negotiated with the Shiqiaozi Public Security Branch, demanding that Wang Qifu be handed over for questioning. The branch immediately reported the situation to the Benxi County Government and negotiated with the garrison unit, preventing the handover. The garrison captain had already agreed not to hand him over, believing the matter could be resolved. However, two days later, for reasons unknown, the garrison unit suddenly reneged on their promise, lined up, and rushed over to surround the branch, forcing them to hand over Wang Qifu. The encirclement lasted for ten hours before they finally withdrew. The Benxi County Government is now preparing to negotiate again, but the outcome remains unknown. (15th)</p>
<p>▲ Negotiations Regarding Japanese Soldiers Conducting Exercises on the Tumen River, Jilin Correspondence: The people of Hunchun County had previously heard rumors that a Japanese engineering corps stationed in Huining, Korea, would conduct large-scale exercises on the other side of the Tumen River. On the 4th of this month, over two hundred members of the corps indeed conducted a bridge-building and marching exercise on the banks of the Seongcheon River in Korean territory. County Magistrate Cui Guolan, upon hearing the news, immediately met with the Japanese Deputy Consul stationed in Hunchun to protest, stating that the Tumen River was an international river between China and Japan and that this action by the Japanese military clearly violated international law. Moreover, given the current tense situation in the wake of the anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea, conducting exercises near the Chinese border without cause would only create unrest. He demanded that they immediately cease the exercises. The Japanese Deputy Consul stated that the exercises were scheduled to last for three weeks, from August 4th to 25th, and that the schedule was fixed and difficult to change, but he agreed to convey the county magistrate's protest to the military authorities. On the 5th, over thirty steamboats were seen sailing down the river, arriving from Huining, fully loaded with military supplies. The number of troops on the opposite bank in Seongcheon was increased to three large battalions. On the 8th and 9th, open-air tents were seen lining the riverbank on the opposite side, with stakes being driven into our bank in preparation for bridge construction. Soon after, bugles were sounded, and several military pontoon bridges (using inflatable bladders) were erected. With the firing of cannons, the two armies charged and fought, creating the appearance of a forced crossing. The entire area along the riverbank was soon shrouded in smoke. It is reported that County Magistrate Cui again raised a protest on the 9th and reported the matter to the provincial government for investigation. The fact that the Japanese side did not inform our authorities in advance about their bridge-building exercise, but instead showed such disregard for our national sovereignty, is truly disheartening.</p>
<p>▲ Negotiations Regarding Japanese Police Insulting Students, Jilin: Lu Shan, a student from the 18th class of the junior grade at the Fifth Middle School of Jilin Province, Wang Chenglin, a student from the 19th class, and Shen Enbo, a student from Yuwen Middle School, all natives of Bin County, were returning home for the summer vacation. On the 19th of last month, at noon, they boarded the Jichang train at Jilin Tower and arrived at Toudaogou at 3:00 PM. They intended to rest at the nearby Tianju Dong Inn. The innkeeper, Tong Lanting, and Chen Wanhong carried the students' luggage. The students told them to quickly check the items, but the innkeeper said it would be fine to check them at the inn. After arriving at the inn, the students, feeling thirsty and tired, ordered tea and water without checking their belongings. At this moment, Japanese police suddenly entered the room to inspect it. Lu, a student, said, "This blue cloth package is not ours." They hurriedly called Tong Lanting, the innkeeper, who explained that the package was similar in size and material to the students' belongings and had been mistakenly taken. Unexpectedly, the Japanese police officers, without saying a word, immediately slapped each of the students on the face and took Lu Shan, Wang Chenglin, Tong Lanting, Chen Wanhong, and another guest whose name was unknown to the police station of the Changchun Railway Police, where they were interrogated and slapped again. During the interrogation, they were forced to kneel. The students, succumbing to brute force, had to endure it. That evening, they were transferred to the Changchun Police Department. That night, someone telegraphed the situation to the principal of the middle school, who rushed to Changchun on the morning of the 20th. After investigating, it was confirmed that Tong Lanting and others had mistakenly taken the package. The principal visited Director Zhou of the Changchun Municipal Government to request negotiations. The Japanese police department then released the students. After returning to the inn, the students, feeling deeply humiliated by being slapped in the face and forced to kneel by the Japanese police for no reason, were extremely indignant. The principal, fearing that the students would take rash actions, advised them to take the China Eastern Railway train back home that night. It is now reported that the provincial government, after receiving the report of this case, believes that the actions of the Japanese police were close to deliberate insult and has ordered the diplomatic authorities to formally lodge a protest.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Zhu and Mao Make a Desperate Gamble <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fierce Bloody Battle at Xiaopu, Huangpi</p>
<p>▲ Two-Thirds of the Main Force of the Bandits Killed or Wounded</p>
<p>▲ Chiang Encourages Refugees to Return Home for the Harvest</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the successive loss of Guangchang, Lichuan, Shicheng, Ningdu, Donggu, Xingguo, and other important bandit strongholds by the Red bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang, their remaining forces gathered between Yudu and Xingguo and hid in the deep mountains and remote valleys. They stretched from Yinkeng, Gekeng, and Laicun north of Yudu, northwest through Jiangbei Cave and Liantang, then northeast through Liangcun, Yuexitou, Pijunbu, and Nankeng south of Yongfeng, all the way to the Wangpi and Xiaopu area north of Ningdu (bordering Le'an, Guangchang, Yongfeng, and Nanfeng), where bandit troops were lurking. Recently, in a final desperate gamble, on the 9th, 10th, and 11th, they launched fierce attacks on the left-wing armies of Mao Bingwen and others in Wangpi and Xiaopu. The suppression armies of Mao Bingwen, Sun Lianzhong, Luo Zhuoying, Wei Lihuang, and others engaged them in battle, firing machine guns and artillery at the bandits. The bandit soldiers and peasant bandits suffered heavy casualties, but the Red bandits continued to charge, one after another, like moths to a flame. The suppression armies responded calmly. It is estimated that in the mountains near Huangpi and Xiaopu, the two sides engaged in close combat for two days and nights, with bandit corpses and red flags scattered all over the ground. The intensity of the battle was several times greater than the previous campaigns in Donggu and Xingguo, and it was the fiercest battle since the start of the suppression campaign. The result was the defeat of the bandits. According to prisoners captured by the forward headquarters, "The battles of Wangpi and Xiaopu, as well as the previous battles of Liangcun and Liantang, were Zhu and Mao's attempt to gather the remnants and make a final desperate gamble. If they won, they would occupy the area; if they lost, they would break up into smaller groups and scatter. But the result is that two-thirds of Zhu and Mao's main force were killed or wounded." Furthermore, the headquarters received aircraft reports: (A) For several days, they were ordered to bomb the bandits in the mountains near Gaoxingxu (north of Xingguo), Shacun (south of Taihe), Longping Yongfengping (between Xingguo and Wan'an), dropping over a hundred heavy bombs, all of which hit their targets and killed many bandits. (B) Our troops are stationed at Gulonggang (border of Xingguo and Yudu), Toupi, Pijunbu, Nankeng (border of Yongfeng and Ningdu), and Wangpi Xiaopu (north of Ningdu). No bandits were found in Qianshanxu (border of Nanfeng, Guangchang, and Minjianing). In addition, various armies also telegraphed reports of battle situations: (1) Mao Bingwen telegraphed that there were three to four thousand Red Guards, police battalions, and Young Pioneers in the vicinity of Toupi, armed with over a thousand rifles and spears. After being suppressed by the right-wing army, the bandits resisted for several hours, suffering heavy casualties and fleeing into the mountains. They are currently being searched for. (2) Jiang Dingwen telegraphed that over a thousand bandits were hiding in Changleguan and Bijia Mountain in Xingguo, forming gangs at night to plunder. The people, unable to bear the harassment, fled to Xingguo and became guides for the national army. On the 11th, they were dispatched to suppress the bandits, and by the evening of the 12th, over five hundred bandits were killed. The remaining bandits fled, and many were killed by local militias. (3) Luo Zhuoying telegraphed that several thousand of Huang Gonglue and Peng Dehuai's remnants were hiding in the Toupi and Pijunbu area. At 10:00 PM on the 13th, our army advanced from Yuexi to suppress them, with one regiment ambushing the mountains connecting Pijunbu, and the main force detouring to the bandits' rear. Only a small force faced the bandits head-on. When our main force charged into the bandits' ranks, the bandits offered slight resistance and fled into the Pijunbu mountains. At that time, ambushes were launched from all sides, and the bandits were attacked from the front and rear. It is estimated that over a thousand bandits were killed, and many were captured, including a pseudo-division commander named Huang Gonglue and two Peng bandit regiment commanders, who are being interrogated. Our army is now advancing from Pijunbu to Nankeng, where they killed another thousand bandits. The remaining bandits fled and disappeared.</p>
<p>In order to encourage the armies to completely eliminate the remaining bandits in the shortest possible time, Commander-in-Chief Chiang issued a special order to all units yesterday, stating that since the start of the bandit suppression, our loyal and brave armies have not failed in their mission and have not shirked their duties. Therefore, they have been able to quickly capture famous cities and frighten the bandits, comforting our Party, our country, the late Generalissimo, and the spirits of the martyred generals and soldiers in heaven, and alleviating the great suffering of our people by eliminating the root cause of our national woes. However, evil must be eradicated completely. All generals and soldiers must have the determination to sacrifice themselves and fight the remaining bandits to the death in order to completely eliminate them in the shortest possible time and achieve complete victory. At the same time, several orders were drafted to encourage the people in the newly captured areas to return home to harvest their crops. The orders stated that all people who return home within three days will be protected and should quickly return home to harvest their crops. These are good people, etc. This order has been printed in 100,000 copies by the Political Training Department and distributed by aircraft. The current status of the post-war reconstruction, which the Party and government are addressing, is as follows: (1) Actively raising relief funds, which have already reached several hundred thousand. A portion is being used for emergency relief in Guangchang, Ningdu, Xingguo, and other places, a portion is being used for work relief on the Gan-Yue and Gan-Min roads, and a portion is being used to establish farmers' banks to promote cooperative movements. (2) The Local Autonomy Office has dispatched Zhu Zhi and two others in three groups to Ji'an and eight other districts to guide local autonomy. (3) The Self-Defense Office has drafted measures to reorganize the police and security groups in each county, ordering the counties to earnestly reorganize and re-equip them, so that they can become a useful civilian force for self-defense.

<h3 id="e63">The Wuhan Flood Has Not Yet Ended <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Wuchang Surrounded by Water</p>
<p>▲ A Twenty-Zhang Breach in the North City Corner, River Water Enters the City</p>
<p>The Water Level in Hankou Continues to Rise</p>
<p>▲ The Long Dike Has Completely Collapsed, Drainage Plans Have Failed</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the city of Hankou was flooded, the dikes and sluices in Wuchang also began to show signs of danger. However, due to its higher elevation and sturdy walls, the floodwaters could not easily breach the city, and refugees flocked there, viewing it as a safe haven. As a result, cramped and humble dwellings were suddenly filled to capacity, and once-desolate hotels were overwhelmed. In less than ten days, landlords and innkeepers had tripled their profits. However, the river water rose daily, exceeding the height of the banks. Floodwater seeped into the city through hidden breaches in the riverside city gates. The accumulated water in the city had nowhere to drain, and when it joined the river water, its power increased. The low-lying areas behind and in front of the mountains were quickly submerged, and the chopsticks street dike, which protected Hanyang Gate, was breached by floodwater on the 15th. At the same time, a twenty-zhang breach appeared in the dike at the north city corner, and the surrounding streets were immediately flooded to neck-deep. Upon hearing the news, Director Chen Keming of the Water Conservancy Bureau, Director Liu Wendao of the Civil Affairs Department, Director Fang Dazhi of the Construction Department, and Secretary-General Peng Jieshi of the Provincial Government personally supervised the workers in rescue efforts. By 4:00 PM, the breach had been plugged. The Provincial Government issued a strict order to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, requiring them to recruit 2,000 laborers from various factories before 6:00 PM that evening to form shifts for protection. If the factories refused, they would be charged with intentionally creating an opportunity for ulterior motives. If the recruitment was not successful and the project was delayed, the director of the bureau would be held accountable. The reporter visited the site the next morning and saw that the breach at the north city corner had been blocked, and the areas of Desheng Bridge, Qinglong Lane, Xiongchu Building, Qing Bridge, Dufudi, Juhua Street, and Fukou Street were all submerged. Wenchang Gate and Wusheng Gate had also been flooded. The refugees were running and crying out in distress, a truly tragic sight. The area that was once blessed by nature was now facing inundation. The dike at Xujiapeng, the end of the Wu-Chang Road, had not yet been breached, but the water level had exceeded the tracks by nine inches. At Yujiazan, slightly south, it had exceeded the tracks by five inches. It was reported that in the Xianning section, it had exceeded the tracks by two feet. Passenger and freight trains were still running through the water, but if the water level rose further, they would be forced to suspend operations.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The city of Hankou has suffered from the flood for half a month, and the river water continues to rise. As of the 16th, it has reached 52 feet 9 inches, and the accumulated water in the streets has become increasingly deep. In the initial stages of the flooding, the people were most hopeful that the drainage plan would be successful, believing that the city could be restored to its original state in seven days. However, with the recent wind and rain, the long dike has completely collapsed, and the plan has been declared a complete failure. Not only has the original goal not been achieved, but boats and vehicles have been blocked, hindering transportation. In response to the people's requests, the authorities have agreed to completely dismantle the dike. Due to the excessive water depth, rickshaws are ineffective, so a second registration of boats has been approved, and over 2,000 boats have been registered. The management of the free ferries is also being improved to ensure convenient passage for the people without the need to solicit tips. Other post-disaster issues are being discussed in detail. The municipal government has submitted the following four key points to the provincial government's Flood Prevention Office for consideration: (1) Transportation: Designating routes for passage throughout the city, removing sandbags from those routes to facilitate traffic, and posting sentries on routes outside the designated areas to prevent unauthorized passage and maintain order. (2) Refugee Relief: The number of refugees seeking shelter in various locations is very high, especially those gathered at the railway, where it is difficult to distinguish between good and bad. In addition, exposure to the sun and night air creates unsanitary conditions that will inevitably lead to epidemics. Strict measures should be taken to transfer them to shelters as much as possible. (3) Unemployment Relief: The number of unemployed people has increased daily with the rising water level. The factories have suspended operations, and the workers are struggling to survive. The factories should be ordered to bear the temporary pain and maintain the minimum living standards for their workers. The number of rickshaw and flatbed drivers exceeds 200,000, and they are unable to work due to the deep water. Measures should be taken to provide relief quickly. (4) Suppression of Unemployed Vagrants: There are many unemployed vagrants in Hankou, and their livelihood often depends on illegal activities. With the rising water level, their means of survival have been cut off, and incidents that affect public order are likely to occur. The military police should be ordered to pay close attention to prevent disturbances. It is reported that the provincial government and the Flood Prevention Office will adopt and implement these suggestions. Meanwhile, efforts to reinforce the dikes continue. A breach was discovered in the Huangjingtang Dike on the 16th, but it has been stabilized after vigorous rescue efforts. It should also be reported that the Japanese concession, known as "Man Can Conquer Nature," was flooded on the 15th. The water depth reached four to five feet in some areas and two to three feet in others. Even with the strong dikes and the efforts of officials and civilians, they could not avoid the flood. This shows the immense power of the water, which cannot be resisted. (August 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Wuhan Flood Prevention Office Punishes Officials in Charge of Flood Control <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fang Dazhi and Others Receive One Major Demerit Each</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the river water suddenly rose and the dikes collapsed, the business district of Wuhan has been inundated. The transformation of mulberry fields into a vast ocean is a source of grief. The water has now receded by about an inch from the highest recorded level of 51 feet 9 inches. There are no reports of more floodwaters arriving from Xiangyang, Yichang, Chongqing, or Yuezhou. The refugees who have suffered greatly are relieved. However, after Wuchang was flooded, the water threatened to engulf the entire city, and the Huangjingtang Dike and the foundations of the Chuanhan Railway in Hankou also showed signs of danger. As a result, the people are fleeing to other places in droves, except for the poor refugees who cannot afford to travel far. The occurrence of this flood was due to the unsoundness of the dikes and the ineffectiveness of the rescue efforts by the authorities. The people cried out loudly, but their pleas were not heeded. It was not until the north city corner was breached and the Qiaokou Dike was in danger that the Flood Prevention Office discovered that the rescue personnel were indeed acting perfunctorily and causing delays. Director Fang Dazhi of the Construction Department, Director Chen Keming of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and Mayor He Baohua of Hankou were severely reprimanded and ordered to invigorate their spirits and take remedial action. Perhaps it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep has been lost. The two telegrams from the Flood Prevention Office are recorded below: (1) To Director Fang of the Wuchang Construction Department and Director Chen of the Water Conservancy Bureau: It has been strictly ordered that you, as the responsible directors, dispatch more personnel and make every effort to protect the dikes, as the river water has been rising continuously and the dikes are in danger. However, it has been found that some of the rescue personnel dispatched by the Construction Department are acting perfunctorily, and some of the Flood Prevention personnel of the Bureau have abandoned their duties. The directors have failed to supervise effectively, causing delays in critical work. You are hereby given one major demerit each as a light punishment. As for the personnel who have failed to provide effective rescue efforts, the directors should investigate and submit their names for punishment. The Kuizi Street Dike has now collapsed, and the river water continues to flow into the areas of Dufudi, Qinglong Street, and Caohumen, threatening to engulf the Liangdao Street area. The people are in an uproar, running in all directions, and public order is extremely chaotic. If measures are not taken quickly to strengthen the defenses, the water will inevitably engulf the entire city and affect public security. The directors are responsible for this and must not make the same mistake again and again, lest you incur severe reprimands. You must invigorate your spirits, take remedial action, investigate and protect effectively, and make every effort to recover without being discouraged by the rising water and allowing it to breach the dikes. Be warned. (2) To Mayor He Baohua of the Hankou Municipal Government: According to reports, the rescue personnel at the Huangjingtang Chuanhan Railway left their posts last night and have not returned to work this morning. The river water has now flooded the dike, and danger is imminent. The mayor has failed to supervise effectively, causing delays and neglecting duties. You are hereby given one major demerit. The personnel who have abandoned their duties should also be reported for punishment. The dike at that location has not yet collapsed. You are still expected to personally supervise the personnel to go to the site and provide protection without fear of hardship. You must make every effort to take remedial action and not act perfunctorily again, lest you incur guilt. Be warned. (August 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Shandong Yellow River Water Level Rising, Warning Issued <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲ Water Level in Shaanxi Flows Downstream</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This year, the Shandong Province has experienced continuous heavy rain for over a month, causing widespread flooding as all streams converge. As a result, the Yellow River water level has risen repeatedly, reaching a maximum height of 9.2 zhang above sea level. According to two telegrams from the Jianghan Water Level Station in Shaanxi Province, upstream, received by the River Affairs Bureau, the water level has risen by a total of 3 chi. According to historical Yellow River water level ratios, a 1 chi rise in Shaanxi translates to a 3 chi rise in Shandong. The current water level in Shandong is already as high as 9.2 zhang, which is very close to the danger line of 9.3 zhang. With the significant rise in water level in Shaanxi flowing downstream, the river water in Shandong will inevitably rise more sharply, and the danger is difficult to imagine. After receiving the warning, the River Affairs Bureau immediately sent urgent telegrams to the upper and lower reaches of the two general sections and the ten sub-sections, stating that according to the calculation of the water flow schedule, the water will arrive soon and ordering them to strengthen their defenses and not be negligent. The recent documents and telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) To the Jinan River Affairs Bureau: Today's third water mark reading is 2.58 meters, which is 0.54 meters higher than the highest water level of this year. Xin Yunhai kowtows. (1) Urgent to the Chief of the Upper and Lower Reaches General Section, Chief of the Ten Sub-sections, and all Defense Committee Members: The previous telegram from Shaanxi reported that the river water rose by 1 chi 3 cun 8 fen, and a telegram from Yu ordered defense measures to be taken. Now, according to a telegram from Shaanxi today, the river water has risen again by 1 chi 6 cun 2 fen, for a total rise of 3 chi. The water level is very high. According to water schedule calculations, it will arrive in Dong within days. You are to immediately notify the chiefs of all defense areas and all water patrols, and also inform the village chiefs along the river to strengthen their defenses and not be negligent. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Bureau, stamped. (1) The Shaanxi Water Level Station telegraphed to the River Affairs Bureau: The river water rose by 1 chi 3 cun 8 fen today, 1 chi 6 cun 2 fen today, and 3 chi 4 cun 6 fen 2 li today. The total rise is 6 chi 4 cun 6 fen 2 li. (1) The River Affairs Bureau presented a report to the Provincial Government, reporting on the matter: "It is now reported that the staff member Zhao Rongfu, the defender Zhang Lifu, and the Chief of the Upper South First Sub-section, Wang Huaiyi, telegraphed urgently that the heavy rain has been continuous, and the water level has risen by 1 chi 2 cun and is still rising. Li Gong Shi Dam, the fifth and sixth embankments have just been secured, but the crests of the first, second, third, and fourth embankments, and the upper corners of the sixth and seventh embankments, are also underwater again. All other embankments are also very low in the water. The current is turbulent, creating a dangerous situation. The first, second, third, and fourth embankments have already been secured with rows of piles, connected by ropes and pressed down with half-bricks. The fifth, sixth, and seventh embankments are being supervised to be pressed down with sacks filled with sand. The base of the downstream mouth of the dam has been eroded by the swirling currents, and semi-bricks have been added for protection. The water level of the Great River is still rising, and the main current at Liuzhuang is gradually shifting downstream, now reaching the Jiao area, and the main dike is being eroded. Willow bundles are being cut and used for protection on the seventh embankment to resist the erosion. In view of the above situation, in addition to telegraphically requesting additional materials and labor to be dispatched and to work day and night to strengthen the defenses, it is appropriate to submit a report to the government for review and approval, which is in the public interest." (1) The River Affairs Bureau telegraphed to the Shandong Provincial Government, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government: "It is now reported that the Shaanxi observer telegraphed that since yesterday, the river water has risen by 3 chi 4 cun 6 fen 2 li, for a total rise of 6 chi 4 cun 6 fen 2 li. According to a water schedule of 4 meters per second, it will reach the various work sections under this bureau in four days. The autumn flood season is long, and the large current is strong, creating a dangerous situation. In addition to ordering the three upper and lower reaches sections to be notified and to inform the district and village chiefs along the river to strengthen their defenses, it is requested that the government quickly telegraph the county magistrates of the counties along the river to jointly prevent, control, assist in rescue and protective measures so that there is no risk. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, stamped. (August 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Relief for Flood Disaster in Anhui Province <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲ The China Relief Commission Allocates 170,000 Yuan for Emergency Relief</p>
<p>▲ Bandits Breach Dike Embankments, Flooding 400,000 Mu of Farmland</p>
<p>▲ Current Water Levels Still Rising</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The severity of this year's flood disaster in Anhui Province is unprecedented in decades. Northern Anhui is already impoverished, making the plight of the disaster victims even more dire. Southern Anhui, with its focus on agricultural land, has suffered particularly heavy losses. The situation continues to worsen daily. The only remaining protection for Wuhu is the Wanchun Lake Dike, but it too is in danger. The Huangsi Beach area, belonging to Wuwei County across the river from Wuhu, consists of over 900,000 mu of farmland in the Upper Nine and Lower Nine Lian, making it the largest and most fertile agricultural region in Anhui, and a crucial barrier for the farmland of seven counties in central Anhui, including Lujiang, Hexian, Hanshan, and Quanjiao. The dike along the river is of even greater importance to the local people. During the early Republic, 400,000 yuan was spent to construct a transverse dike. Although the river tide has risen sharply this year, it was fortunately preserved thanks to the dike and the efforts of the people. Unexpectedly, the previous night, the dike at Xingouxia was suddenly breached by bandits wielding guns, destroying several zhang. When farmers tried to intervene, the bandits opened fire. Instantly, the river water rushed in like a stampede of horses, directly flooding approximately 400,000 mu of fertile farmland in the Lower Nine Lian of Huangsi Beach. The farmers cried out in despair, their voices heard for several li. The bandits' motive for breaching the dike is said to be anger over the recent serious efforts by the police and local militia to suppress banditry. Now, the people of the Upper Nine Lian and the seven counties of Luhe are in a state of extreme panic, and can only defend day and night, hoping that the river tide will recede quickly. The Wuhu Flood Relief Association previously sent Standing Committee member He Wuzi to Beijing and Shanghai to seek relief from the Central Relief Commission and the Shanghai Huayang Charity Relief Association. He has now returned to Wuhu after completing his mission. According to his report, Ning Songquan, a Anhui businessman in Shanghai, personally donated 10,000 yuan, and also distributed 28 donation books to the Anhui Bank of Shanghai and Wang Delin, among others, to solicit donations. On his return trip, he attended a meeting of the Central Relief Commission in Beijing, where he, along with Su Minsheng, a representative from northern Anhui, strongly advocated for Anhui to be designated as a specially affected disaster area, and secured 170,000 yuan in emergency relief funds. These relief funds were allocated by the Ministry of Finance using 2 million yuan in salt tax treasury bonds, with 170,000 yuan each for Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei, 130,000 yuan each for Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Henan, 80,000 yuan for Zhejiang, 10,000 yuan for emergency relief in Guizhou, and 20,000 yuan for epidemic prevention in Hankou. Hong Hui, a special commissioner sent by the China Relief Commission to Anhui Province to investigate the disaster, has already set out, accompanied by four people. They will first go to Huaining and Bengbu, and then come to Wuhu. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Banditry Amidst the Flood Disaster in Northern Anhui <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: In recent years, northern Anhui has been unfortunately plagued by frequent disasters, damaging the local vitality and causing the people's livelihood to decline. This summer's floods have displaced disaster victims, and those unwilling to starve to death have often resorted to taking risks, joining bandit gangs and engaging in piracy on the water. Therefore, the flood disaster has not ended, and banditry has returned. Alas, the common people, truly not knowing where their death will come from. Now, I will briefly describe the bandit situation in various counties:</p>
<p>▲ Fengtai: The flood disaster in Fengtai is particularly severe, and the banditry is also the most rampant. Recently, Ni Rongxian, the commander in charge of suppressing bandits in Fengtai, Huaiyuan, and Fengyang counties, led his troops, along with an independent battalion of the Provisional Second Brigade, on the Bao Da, Bao Ren, Da Li, and Xiao Lun steamers, to encircle the bandit area of Gugouji. After several hours of fierce fighting, they killed over twenty bandits on the spot, including the notorious bandits Yang Shixiao, Xie Tuzi, Cao Shougou, and Xue Wenhua, captured nine bandits and suspects, rescued the hostages Meng Guangyi and the eighth person, and seized two rifles. The bandit forces were unable to resist and began to flee northwest.</p>
<p>▲ Mengcheng: After the bandits in Fengtai County were severely suppressed by government troops recently, some of them fled into the southeastern townships of Mengcheng, entrenched in the Dumugiao area, seventy li from the city. There are about one hundred people, and they are acting to advance towards Licangji. The residents along the Ci River are extremely frightened because of the widespread floods, with nowhere to escape. The local militia is also obstructed by the water and cannot defend. They can only allow the bandits to loot. However, the Licangji People's Self-Defense Corps has contacted various village militias to cooperate in suppressing the bandits.</p>
<p>▲ Sixian: Sixian County borders Hongze Lake to the east, and the terrain is low-lying. This summer's heavy rains have caused the water to be vast and expansive, and many of the plains along the lake have been submerged. There are 20,000 households affected by the disaster. Local bandits have taken advantage of the flood to rise up like silkworms, and their momentum is very rampant. The people have suffered from both the flood disaster and banditry, and have specifically requested troops from the authorities to suppress them. The provincial government has specially dispatched a police supplementary regiment to Sixian to suppress the bandits. Wang Ding, the regimental commander of the regiment, arrived in Sixian a few days ago and is stationed at the Xilai Temple outside the West Gate. Due to continuous cloudy and rainy days, they have been unable to set off. Now that the weather has cleared, the regiment has dispatched teams to search and suppress bandits in the countryside.</p>
<p>▲ Lai'an: The leader of the bandits in Lai'an County is Pei Si, who leads over three hundred bandits, entrenched in the mountains in the northwest. They have sophisticated firearms and are extremely fierce, and cases of murder and kidnapping are frequently heard of. Recently, they even broke into the home of Bao Ge, a resident of Wulidun, two li from the city, to kidnap him, and threatened to attack the county seat. As a result, the residents inside the city are in extreme panic. The county party headquarters has reported the situation to the province by telegram, requesting the dispatch of troops to garrison and suppress the bandits. Moreover, the bandit atmosphere is also fierce in Zhangshan Township in the eastern district of Lai'an, and kidnappings are carried out in broad daylight without any scruples. (August 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">General Situation of the Flood Disaster in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲ Bandit Disasters in Forty to Fifty Counties</p>
<p>▲ Flood Disasters Also in Thirty-Odd Counties</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Of the eighty-one counties in Jiangxi, over forty have been ravaged by bandits, with southern and western Jiangxi being the most severely affected. Eastern and northern Jiangxi are relatively less affected. However, recently, the counties along the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake in northern Jiangxi, as well as the areas along the Gan and Yuan Rivers, although less affected by bandits, have suffered extremely severe flood disasters. The disaster situation is widespread throughout the province, and there will be none who are not refugees. In addition to distributing 600 yuan each to Jiujiang and other counties a few days ago when the water was surging, to purchase pills, matches, and biscuits for emergency relief in the water, the Provincial Relief Association has now allocated 90,000 yuan as special relief funds and dispatched personnel to various water areas to investigate and express sympathy, in order to urge local authorities to handle post-disaster relief work such as repairing dikes and replanting crops. The Party and Government Council has also raised hundreds of thousands of yuan in relief funds, along with one million in unified tax treasury bonds issued by the central government, totaling no less than one million yuan. Apart from using the majority to relieve bandit disasters, establishing refugee shelters in Ningdu, Ji'an, and Xingguo counties, and building roads using work-for-relief programs, a small portion will be used for water relief, such as establishing cattle mortgage centers, which will also be implemented in order. Now, the general situation of the flood disaster in various counties is recorded as follows: (Jiujiang) In July, the river water rose sharply, flooding the embankments, and the city was completely submerged in water. The railway tracks were also submerged. The water level rose to 45.5 feet at the water gate. (Xingzi) Since mid-July, there have been continuous torrential rains, and mountain floods have erupted suddenly. Low-lying areas are completely submerged in water, and elevated areas have also become flooded. Most of the fields and houses have been submerged, and many people and livestock have been washed away.

(Xiajiang) The great flood in the northwest townships this spring caused the early rice harvest to fail. Now, they have been flooded again, submerging the fields on both sides of the river and collapsing countless houses. (Nanchang) This time, the great flood in the Gan River submerged the northeastern, western, and other townships belonging to the county, such as the Youfu, Anle, Gaoshan, Yicheng, Changfang, Wanshou, Di Datang, Dayou, Guangfeng, Liangdu, and Changfeng Jiyi Huobao embankments. Hundreds of zhang of the embankment body collapsed, and tens of li of water, destroying countless houses and livestock.

<h3 id="e69">A Record of Disaster Investigation in Liuxu <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Situation in Xinlongqiao and Other Places is Particularly Tragic</p>
<p>▲ Carrying Dry Food and Reed Mats for Distribution Relief</p>
<p>▲ A Drop in the Bucket, Insufficient for Distribution</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Recently, the river tide has risen and the southeast wind has been strong. The northern bank of the Yangtze River is on the brink of danger. The defensive work along the coast has lost its effectiveness due to the rapid currents. The section of Gongsi Dike in Foganzhou, Jiangdu, suffered a tragic dike break, and the entire island became a swamp, with all the fields damaged. There are a total of fifty-odd dikes in the entire island, and the residents in the dikes, because the water inside the dikes is ten feet deep, the houses have not been submerged, but half of them are in the water. The disaster victims have moved to higher ground to avoid the water, and their plight is imaginable. Lu Xiaobo, chairman of the local Chamber of Commerce, and others, in view of the severity of the disaster, are currently discussing relief methods, and hired a boat to go to inspect yesterday morning, bringing dry food such as Jingjiang cakes, about 7,000 in total, as well as a box of holy water, and more than 100 reed mats, to distribute to the disaster victims. They returned to Zhenjiang that day. According to Mr. Lu, the companions included Ling Shaozeng, Teng Ruqing, Wang Yizhong, Zhang Guirong, Hu Xunchen, and Xu Shulin, and the Red Swastika Society also sent personnel to participate. From Liuxu to Hongqiao, the dikes on the south bank of the automobile road were all submerged, and most of the nearby residents moved to the ridges and the automobile road, setting up cloth sheds to settle down. Only children are prone to falling into the water if they are not careful. In low-lying areas, every time the tide comes, the water is level with the shore. In Hongqiao Town, there is still about a foot of accumulated water. At that time, a person surnamed Yin detailed the disaster situation, and said that the most severely affected areas were Xinlongqiao, Gongsi Dike, Gongli Dike, and Toupeng. The relief items brought by the ship were distributed, and after a short stay, they returned to the Liuxu automobile station to board the boat, intending to investigate Xinlongqiao and other places. However, the harbor there was narrow and the boat could not enter, so they hired a small boat to go ashore, led by the local Baojia, and first went to Xinlongqiao, Gongsi Dike, Gongli Dike, Toupeng and other places to inspect. The disaster situation was indeed more serious, and the residents were all living on the shore, and their food supply was about to run out, relying only on relief to survive, and some were not even full for a day. They also saw a pregnant woman who had given birth not long ago also sleeping in the open on the shore. The residents on the riverbank had nowhere to escape, so they lived in the water, and the sound of begging for relief along the way was endless, and the situation was extremely tragic. They distributed the remaining relief items on the ship, and the personnel from the Zhenjiang Red Swastika Society were dispatched to distribute them. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, all the items were distributed. The most needed items in the disaster area now are reed mats. Even if there were 20,000 sheets, they could be distributed immediately. The items we brought were a drop in the bucket and were insufficient for distribution. Also, due to time constraints, we were unable to investigate and survey each area, which is a great pity. There are now dozens of dikes urgently awaiting relief, and it is hoped that all philanthropists will generously donate and purchase more reed mats, rice, and cooking utensils to go to distribute relief to save the disaster victims. It is also heard that Mr. Lu and others are now raising relief funds and plan to go to distribute relief again. The relief funds are collected by Dingchang Money Shop on Rixin Street. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">He Jian Stipulates Uniform Military Propaganda Methods <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sends Personnel to Review Military News</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: He Jian, recently, due to the Guangdong and Guangxi plans for Hunan, and the Jiangxi bandits also seem to be fleeing west, the defense of Hunan Province is particularly tense. Military actions and all deployments are extremely important and should be kept strictly confidential. Therefore, he instructed the Secretariat of the Four Route Headquarters to draft four military propaganda uniform methods, and sent a letter to the Department of Civil Affairs, asking them to instruct all newspapers and news agencies in the city to comply with and implement them. At the same time, Song Min, the section chief of the Propaganda Section of the General Secretariat, was appointed to be responsible for the review of military news, in order to promote propaganda. The public letter and methods are recorded as follows: (1) The headquarters' letter to the Department of Civil Affairs says: Respectfully, it is found that the current situation is unstable, and rumors are easy to arise, and the spread of rumors often confuses the public. There are many newspapers and news agencies in Changsha City, and reporters often arbitrarily divulge military deployments, troop positions, and combat plans in their interviews and articles. The newspapers also find it difficult to choose and publish as much as possible, causing readers to speculate and doubt each other. Its harm to the opportunity and impact on the situation is not small. Therefore, the headquarters has specially drafted four military propaganda uniform methods, and sent a letter to your department, requesting you to instruct all newspapers and news agencies to comply with and implement them. (2) Four uniform propaganda methods: 1. All military news within the province will be issued by the Propaganda Section of the Secretariat of the Headquarters. 2. Newspapers must recognize the seal of the Propaganda Section of the Secretariat of the Headquarters for military news in this province before it can be published. 3. If reporters from news agencies obtain various military news elsewhere, they must send the manuscript to the Section Chief of the Propaganda Section of the Secretariat of the Headquarters for review. If it is deemed publishable, it will be stamped on it. 4. If military news manuscripts without the "General Secretary Xuan" stamp are published, only the newspapers will be questioned, and the issuer will not be investigated. (August 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Record of the Second Provincial Congress of Jiangsu Province <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>▲ Plenary Sessions Held in the Morning and Afternoon of the 19th</p>
<p>▲ Several Proposals Regarding Party Affairs Passed</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 19th) was the fifth day of the Second Provincial Congress of Jiangsu Province. The third meeting was held at 9:00 AM, chaired by Yang Xingqin. After leading the attendees to perform the ceremony, the unfinished work reports of various agencies were continued. (1) He Yushu, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, reported, saying that the past work of agriculture and mines was to plan everything and do basic work. Due to insufficient funds and lack of talent, it has not been possible to develop the agricultural sector. Cotton, rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and other categories have been worked hard to improve. Farmers are increasingly willing to use improved silkworm seeds. The annual silk income in Jiangsu Province alone is about 100 million yuan. The fisheries industry is resisting Japanese fishing vessels and seeking the development of the country. The forestry industry is focusing on promoting seedlings, but the results of Zhongshan Forestry in various counties are not good. Cooperative enterprises are very developed. Farmers' banks have already loaned more than 2 million yuan. After the report, representatives Tang Kesheng, Ji Pu, and others inquired about the standards for establishing farmers' banks, the appointment of councilors for the silkworm seed inspection offices, and the relationship between rural cooperatives and farmers' banks. Mr. He immediately answered them one by one in detail, which was very satisfactory to the representatives. After the answers, everyone applauded, and Mr. He retreated with a smile. (2) Li Mingyang, Director of the Security Department, reported, saying that the organization of the Security Department is like an army. Jiangsu Province has recently worked hard to suppress bandits. Since the establishment of the Pacification Supervisor's Office, the General Headquarters has ordered Liang Guanying to be responsible for the Jiangbei area, and the security teams of Jiangsu Province are focusing their efforts on the Jiangnan area. After the report, representative Wu Xiaohan spoke, hoping that the security teams would not be stationed in areas without bandits, and must be stationed in counties where bandits are common to eliminate them. In order to clarify the bandit situation in various counties, Mr. Li specially invited the representatives to meet at the Security Department at 7:00 PM that evening. (3) Yao Mingzhang, a representative sent by the High Court, brought a report and intended to attend the report, but representatives Luo Decheng and Xie Chengyu, one after another, stated that the president of the court should attend the report in person, and requested Yao to step down. Everyone unanimously agreed, and the chairman announced that the work of the High Court would be rescheduled for President Lin Biao to come to Zhenjiang to report in person. Yao then left the meeting without saying a word. (4) Ni Bi of the Reformatory reported, saying that I am attending the report as a representative of the president of the Reformatory and as the director of education, with two qualifications. The purpose of establishing the Reformatory is to transform counter-revolutionaries into revolutionaries. The internal organization is to have one president, concurrently held by Lin Biao, president of the High Court, and three departments: general affairs, management, and education. Each department has a director. A council is also formed, consisting of the president, the three directors, one judge and one prosecutor from the High Court, and one member of the Provincial Party Department. The purpose of education is to make criminals feel and awaken through education. The education methods are: 1. Investigation, 2. Testing, 3. Training, 4. Review, 5. Guidance, 6. Correction, 7. Assessment, 8. Examination, 9. Statistics. As for the education steps and periods, 1. Investigation and testing, 2. Implementation of training, 3. Examination and statistics. After the report, representatives Luo Decai and Hong Guanghua questioned one after another, and Mr. Ni answered them separately.</p>
<p>After the work reports of various agencies were completed, Xu Wenjun, a member of the proposal review committee, reported, saying that 70 proposals had been received yesterday, and 38 had been reviewed, and 32 had not been reviewed. The deadline for all proposals is tonight. Then, Qi Xiyong and Zhang Yuanyang, representatives of the Provincial Party Rectification Committee, respectively answered the questions raised by the representatives of the General Assembly regarding the people's organizations, candidates for the National Assembly, and the dismissal of the Zhengwei in Dangshan County. Representative Zhao Yuzheng and others were dissatisfied and will submit written questions again. It was then proposed to discuss the Provincial Party Affairs Rectification Committee's proposal to promote party affairs work in the province first, according to the agenda. Zhang Yuanyang attended and explained the reasons and methods. Then, representatives Ge Jianshi, Ji Pu, Zhao Yuzheng, and others successively expressed their opinions. Because it was past noon, it was left for discussion at the fourth meeting in the afternoon. The presidium of the General Assembly also decided to organize a political work report review committee, and nominated representatives Tang Shou, Wang Hansheng, Fang Yue, Pan Zhijiu, and Dai Zhiqiang as review committee members, convened by Tang Shou. The solicitation was approved by all representatives.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the fourth General Assembly was continued, with 75 representatives attending, still chaired by Yang Xingqin. After leading the attendees to perform the ceremony, various proposals were discussed. (1) Proposal to promote party affairs work in the province.

<h3 id="e72">Outline of the Shandong-Henan Pacification Plan <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, the Pacification Commissioner for Shandong and Henan, has drafted a plan for pacification in the two provinces of Shandong and Henan and submitted it to the Commander-in-Chief for review. The outline of the plan is as follows: Article 1: Responsibilities and Powers of the Commissioner's Office. Matters related to the pacification of Shandong and Henan provinces shall be handled in direct command of the two provincial governments in accordance with Article 6 of the Regulations of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. Article 2: Establishment of Districts. Generally, one county shall be one district, with the county magistrate concurrently serving as the director. However, in areas with severe banditry or involving two or more counties, special districts may be established, with the director appointed separately by the Pacification Commissioner. Article 3: Completion Deadline. The pacification period is set at six months. If, due to special circumstances, the task cannot be completed on schedule, an extension may be requested, but it shall not exceed another six months. Article 4: Progressive Timetable. Pacification in various regions shall be carried out in three phases, progressing sequentially. The first phase is the suppression phase, set at two months. The second phase is the investigation phase, set at three months. The third phase is the post-pacification phase, set at one month. Counties without bandit activity do not require a suppression phase and can begin directly with the second phase. If the tasks to be completed within each phase cannot be completed within the specified period, an extension may be requested, but it shall not exceed one time the original deadline for each phase. Article 5: Investigation of the Situation. A survey form of bandit conditions in various counties of Shandong and Henan provinces shall be created (the form will be determined separately) to investigate the bandit situation in each county under the jurisdiction of the two provinces, and the severity of bandit activity in each county shall be classified into areas with heavy banditry, areas with light banditry, and areas without banditry. For areas with heavy banditry, troops will be deployed to thoroughly suppress them. For areas with light banditry, the respective counties will be responsible for suppressing them themselves. For areas without banditry, the work of pacification and organization shall begin immediately. Article 6: Suppression of Reactionary Elements. The detailed rules for the implementation of suppression shall include plans for eradicating communist elements and measures for dealing with reactionary elements. Article 7: Expansion of the Responsibilities of the Commissioner's Office. This has been stipulated in Item 1. However, the position of Pacification Commissioner is a special establishment, and the nature of the work described in the Pacification Regulations is different. The scope of responsibilities and powers should be expanded, with emphasis on military suppression. The plan should be drafted by the Military Affairs Department and reported to the Commander-in-Chief for verification at any time. Article 8: Drafting of Detailed Rules. In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulations of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, detailed rules for the implementation of suppression shall be drafted and submitted for approval and implementation. Article 9: Pacification Zones. The pacification work within the jurisdiction of the pacification zones shall still be carried out by the provincial government in accordance with the detailed rules for the implementation of suppression. However, when military matters or deployment of troops are involved, the General Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief may be consulted on a temporary basis. (August 17th)</p>

The manager of the shop, Qin Zhuoqing, ordered a shop assistant to urge A'nan to come downstairs to serve. A'nan had no choice but to get up. As soon as he reached the bottom of the stairs, Qin Zhuoqing, without asking the reason, slapped A'nan twice and said, "If you want to enjoy yourself, you can ask to go home. This place is not for you to enjoy yourself," and so on. A'nan, upon hearing this, was extremely angry and immediately went out and protested, further angering the manager. After closing the shop, A'nan was tied up with rope and severely beaten, leaving him covered in injuries. After being reprimanded, A'nan went home, secretly drank a bowl of raw opium, and then went to the shop to sleep. After a while, the manager, Qin Zhuoqing, saw that his face was pale and knew that he had taken poison. He immediately sent him to Dr. Tan Shumo's nearby clinic for treatment, but it was ineffective. He was then transferred to Puren Hospital for treatment, but due to the excessive amount of poison, he soon died. The shop assistant reported this to the deceased's family. Upon hearing the news, his father, Ziqing, went to Zhengmao and had a serious dispute with Qin Zhuoqing. Later, after mediation by a Mr. Cai, the matter was settled with 600 yuan.</p>

Hurry to collect all the silver due and pay it in full within the time limit. The collection has been open for a long time, and the deadline is approaching in a flash. I am afraid that the heads of each Jia may have misunderstandings and evasions. It has now been stipulated that the canal rice will be taken over, and each Tu will still be responsible for collecting the payments by the head of the first Jia. In each Tu, the upper and lower busy takeover is uniformly responsible by the head of the second Jia, in order to show uniformity. In addition to ordering the heads of each Jia to follow and distribute letters, yesterday a special letter was sent to the heads of each district for investigation.</p>

<p>Public Security Branch Chief of Houcheng Accused of Extortion: More than 120 citizens from Shazhou, including Zhao Junyu and Ni Zuolin, stated that since Zhang Ke, the Public Security Branch Chief of Houcheng, took office more than three months ago, he has been extorting huge sums of money under false pretenses. Zhu Linyang and Sun, villagers from Baohe Township in the Fourth District, are both over sixty years old and bedridden. Zhang Ke falsely claimed that he had received secret reports that they were smoking opium and detained them for five days and nights. Zhu was fined 200 yuan, and Sun was fined 100 yuan. On the 11th of this month, Zhang went to Du Jinhai's house in Xinhua Township, Fourth District, falsely claiming that the county magistrate had evidence of smoking opium and demanded a fine of 1,000 yuan. After persuasion, the fine was reduced to 500 yuan. As the full amount was not paid, a promissory note for 150 yuan was given, with Yang Weiqing acting as the intermediary. On the 14th, Zhang went to Li Xinlu's house in Daxin Township and fined him 300 yuan. As the full amount was not paid, a promissory note for 60 yuan was given. Zhao and others listed the facts and submitted a petition to the Provincial Hall, requesting his removal and punishment, and the victims are willing to appear in court for cross-examination. It is unknown how the Provincial Hall will handle this.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Collecting Business Tax: Wu Shuoying, the chairman of the Business Association of this county, together with Shen Lunxu from the Finance Bureau, went to the provincial capital to negotiate with the Finance Department. They received an order from the department instructing the Business Association to collect the business tax on behalf of the government, with a recognized annual amount of 24,000 yuan, to be reported and remitted in installments. The Business Association has now sent personnel, together with bureau officials, to various villages to re-examine and initiate the collection. However, there is still no certainty about the number of recognized payments for various industries in the city and suburbs. The summer tax payment is being urged strictly under orders and is as urgent as fire. On the 16th, the Business Association held an executive committee meeting and resolved to send letters to various industry associations, urging them to clear the summer tax payments by the deadline, without any delay.</p>

<p>River Water Rises Again, Westerner Surveys Disaster: Disaster reports of the river water along the canal of Yangzhou have been repeatedly published. It is learned that on the 18th, the water level at the San Gou gate rose another inch, totaling two zhang and four chi and six cun. The Jiangdu section of the public works office, due to the urgent work, in addition to sending Mr. Hu to hire the China Merchants Bureau's Junfa ship and the Fuyun Bureau's Fengheng ship to transport 1,000 dan of reed firewood to the construction site, also purchased many wooden piles and a certain amount of public copper coins for the workers to use. This morning (the 18th), the Zhenjiang customs assistant officer, Shi Shiduo (a Westerner), led a Chinese translator to Yangzhou to visit the Jiangdu section of the public works office and met with Bao Zexin of the engineering section to inquire about the conditions of the affected farmland and disaster victims downstream. It was decided that they would go to the embankments along the Gaobao area on the 19th to conduct an on-site inspection to prepare a report to the provincial disaster relief association for disaster relief assistance. It was also learned that the northern section of the Shaobo Deputy Dam near Lukinjin North was once flooded, with the water inside the dam being one chi deep. Fortunately, the residents of the southern section of the dam rushed to the rescue, dismantled the building materials of Jia Yi and Xie Zhengyu, the people in charge of that section, and used piles to block the breach. It then collapsed again. Zhang, Kaihua, and others were responsible for purchasing the piles and gathering more than a thousand residents to work hard to repair the breach overnight. However, more than 10,000 mu of the more than 36,000 mu of fields within the dam had been submerged due to the breach. The day before yesterday, from Guabei Balipu to the Yangzi Bridge, there were dozens of places where the dykes were flooded by strong winds and tides. Fortunately, the people gathered by ringing gongs, took rushes to pack soil, and hastily blocked and rescued the embankments, which were spared from danger. More than a thousand women and children who had taken refuge on the higher parts of the automobile road suffered from hunger and cold. The cries could be heard for several miles. The Caoqiao Township in the Fourth District was surrounded by thunderous waters. Due to the simultaneous rise of the Jianghuai Rivers, all the waters burst out and broke through the Guguang Eastern Embankment, and the fields and houses were submerged. After the rush to plug the breach had been completed, on the 16th, the town was hit by strong winds and crazy tides and was also poured into by the Liao Jia Gou water. No dam was unbroken, and no field was not submerged. Yesterday, the township head, Cao Ruxian, and Xu Xichun, the agricultural association clerk of the township, came to the city to report the disaster situation to the county and beg for the appointment of an investigator to exempt the land tax.</p>

It is now reported that Liu has requested assistance from the Zhenjiang Lawyers Association and is planning to sue the higher court. Wu had filed a complaint with the County Government on the evening of the 14th. Yesterday (the 15th) at 6:00 PM, Section Chief Cai Shuxin of the Second Section opened a hearing. According to Wu Baichuan, "At lunchtime on the 14th, I was eating at home when several armed soldiers came and told me to go with them. I asked what was the matter, and they beat me with leather belts and took me to the Zhengyi Newspaper office. Later, they took me to the police headquarters. I don't know why they hit me. I ask the presiding judge to severely punish them," and so on. After the testimony was completed, the injury marks were examined by the Zhu inspection officer and examiner, including one shoe kick injury and three leather belt injuries. Because the defendant had not arrived, Section Chief Cai ordered them to wait for the interrogation.</p>

<p>Water Floods South Gate Small Street: Due to the continuous strong southerly winds in Huaiyin South Gate Small Street, the lake water in Huai'an territory was pushed north, and the entire street was flooded. All the shops were completely closed, and the residents moved to the city to take refuge. The most tragic thing was that foreign ships could not reach the waterside, and the local natives could not cross without a boat, so that men, women, old and young, had to travel in water several feet deep every day, unable to eat when hungry, dripping wet and miserable. The troops of Liang Guanying stationed yesterday (13th) have built a high embankment from the South Gate to prevent the water from entering the city. It is difficult to be certain at present whether it will be able to block the water in the future.</p>

<p>Hangzhou-Changhua Highway Fully Reopened: The Hangzhou-Changhua Highway, after the flood last month, the Hangzhou-Yu and Yulin sections were reopened after the water receded. Only the Hualong to Changhua section was the most severely damaged. The road surface at the Machetou section, 20 kilometers away from Hualong, was damaged by more than one zhang, and three bridge beams of the Meishi Lake Tiantian Lingjia Bridge were washed away. It is now learned that the damaged road surface has been repaired by sending workers. It is estimated that the bridge project cannot be completed in one or two months. For the sake of transportation, the road section chief, Dong Shiqian, found a way to temporarily restore traffic on the entire section by laying foreign pine on the destroyed bridges. The Hutian Bridge was too badly damaged to allow traffic. Fortunately, the water under the bridge was only a few feet deep, and passengers had to wade through the water. It is currently planned to fill the asphalt cylinders with sand and mud to supplement the damaged bridge area, so as to provide relief and normal traffic.</p>

<p>Yu Army's First Division Opens Anhui for Bandit Suppression: Recently, the Yingshan County territory has been harassed by Red Bandits. The Taihu Qianshan area has been invaded. The 57th Division Liang Hongen Department of the Anhui Provincial garrison, and the 53rd Division Li Yun Department Zhang Brigade, transferred from Xun to Anhui, jointly suppressed the bandits, and the bandits began to split. However, there is still a stubborn part. According to military sources, Chen Diaoyuan believes that the two counties of Taihu and Qianshan are connected to Yinghuo in the north and are important in terms of terrain. He specifically telegraphed President Chiang, ordering the Yu Army Liu Zhi Department, which was suppressing bandits in Ganzhou, to dispatch a division of troops to Taihu to assist in the suppression.</p>

<p>▲ Arrested on the 17th</p>
<p>▲ Trial Commenced on the 18th</p>
<p>▲ Transferred on the 19th</p>
<p>Deng Yanda, the leader of the Third Party, was arrested at approximately 3 PM on the 17th by the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters' investigation team, along with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, at No. 20 Yuyuan Lane, Yuyuan Road. A total of fifteen people were arrested along with Deng, including two women. The results of the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Circumstances of the Arrest: Deng is a native of Guangdong, currently 35 years old. In 1926, he served as the director of the political department of the National Revolutionary Army General Headquarters. Later, he joined the International Third Party. For the past year, he has been living in Shanghai, secretly engaging in activities. His residences in Shanghai are approximately the following: (1) No. 1389 Avenue Road (2) No. 20 Yuyuan Lane, Yuyuan Road, (3) No. 159 Avenue Edward VII, French Concession. On the afternoon of the 17th, Deng again gathered representatives at his Yuyuan Road residence for secret training. This was discovered by the Garrison Headquarters, which, along with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, went to arrest Deng at approximately 3 PM. Those arrested along with him included Fang Ju, 21 years old, from Haimen; Deng Wenhu, 30 years old, from Hunan; Huang Su, a woman, 26 years old, from Hubei; Wang Suqing, 21 years old, from Changzhou; Jin Fuguang, 28 years old, from Changzhou; Ren Shuxuan, 18 years old, from Yixing (the landlord); Huang Jinyao, 37 years old, from Suzhou; Zhang Chang, 33 years old, from Chongming; Zhu Fengqing, 20 years old, from Jiangsu; Zhang Xiaoshan, 25 years old, from Hunan; Li Wenying, a woman, 20 years old, from Sichuan; Lu Zhining (also known as Luo Chun, a member of the Communist Party Central Committee), 35 years old, from Sichuan, and thirteen other men and women. All were taken to the police station. 620 silver dollars and a 50-dollar Hong Kong check were found on Deng Yanda. Subsequently, at Lu Zhining's residence at No. 741 Weihaiwei Road, 610 dollars and a savings passbook with 7,000 dollars were found, as well as hundreds of books. Unexpectedly, Xu Shouchang, 35 years old, from Jiangbei, broke into the premises and was also arrested by the detectives. At 7:50 PM that evening, Zheng Songtang (also known as Cheng Pu, also known as Cheng Liyao, 30 years old, from Shanghai), an important member of the Communist Party, was apprehended at No. 32 Mackenzie Road. Communist documents were seized and taken to the police station. After questioning each individual, the police chief ordered them to be detained separately.</p>
<p>▲ Deng's Confession: When Deng Yanda was arrested, he was wearing a dark gray serge suit. He was a burly man with a short mustache and curly hair, looking quite imposing. He gave a written statement at the police station, detailing his life story from childhood to the present. Excerpts are provided below. Deng stated: "I am 35 years old, from Guangdong, and married. I have been back in Shanghai for nearly a year. I have no fixed address. In the past year, I have traveled to various parts of China, but I have spent most of my time in Shanghai. After graduating from elementary school, I entered the Hubei Army Middle School at the age of sixteen. After two years, I transferred to the Baoding Military Academy, where I studied for three years. Later, I was summoned back to Fujian by Mr. Sun Yat-sen to serve as a military advisor until 1922. I participated in the Northern Expedition campaign against Wu Peifu. After returning to Guangdong, I participated in the campaign against Chen Jiongming. Subsequently, I helped Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek establish the Whampoa Military Academy and served as the director of the training department for one year. In early 1925, I left Guangdong to study political economy in Germany. After about a year, I was summoned back by Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and returned to the Whampoa Military Academy as the director of education. After about six months, I was appointed by Chiang as the director of the political department of the General Headquarters and participated in the Northern Expedition campaign of the National Revolutionary Army. In October 1926, Wuhan was occupied, and I was left there to work. In June 1927, I left Wuhan for France to continue studying economics. Two years later, I traveled to Germany, England, and France. I did not return to China until May 1930. Today, I was arrested for discussing Chinese economic issues with several friends."</p>
<p>▲ Judgment and Transfer: At 9:30 AM on the 18th, the police station transferred the fifteen men and women to the First Criminal Court of the High Court. Presiding Judge Song Yuan, along with Judges Du and Ye, took the bench for questioning. Attorney Gu Tianyin represented the police station, while defendants Deng Yanda hired attorneys Zhang Zhirang and Cai Liucheng. Defendant Ren Shuxuan hired attorney Ni Zheng'ao to defend him. A large number of people were present in the courtroom. Judge Song declared that the case was not suitable for public hearing and ordered everyone to leave, except for the attorneys and detectives involved in the case. The Garrison Headquarters sent Inspector Wang and others to the court to request a transfer. Attorney Zhang of the police station stated that the defendants' crimes had taken place entirely within the Chinese area, so he had no objection to the transfer. The defendants' attorneys argued that the case should be handled by the court. Judge Song questioned each defendant individually and then ordered the arguments to begin. The arguments concluded at approximately 2 PM. Judge Song then ordered a temporary recess for consultation. After half an hour, the court reconvened and announced: "Deng Yanda, Zheng Songtang, and the other fifteen individuals will be transferred after the official documents from the Garrison Headquarters arrive. The seized documents will also be transferred." After the announcement, the attorneys for defendant Deng Yanda declared that they would appeal the judgment and requested that the execution be suspended and the case files be transferred to the appeals office. Judge Song then announced: "This case is an assistance case, not a case under litigation, so the execution cannot be suspended." The court then adjourned.</p>
<p>▲ Arrest of Accomplices: It was reported that the Garrison Headquarters, along with detectives from the French Concession Police Station, went to No. 159 Avenue Edward VII at approximately 7 PM on the 17th and arrested Shen Weiyue (also known as Chen Shi), an accomplice, and seized six small boxes of reactionary books, which were taken back to the French Concession Police Station for verification.</p>

<p>▲ Declaration of the General Assembly: To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, all levels of Party Headquarters, all provincial and municipal governments, all mass organizations, and all newspapers, for the public attention of fathers, elders, sons and younger brothers throughout the country: Our country is in extreme crisis today. The greatest threat comes from Japan. Japan relies on its superior strength and uses the policy of fraternal strife to bully our compatriots and destroy our freedom. Now their conspiracy is gradually exposed, and they do not hesitate to resort to violent acts. Our people recognize that this is not only an obstacle to the Chinese National Revolution but also a crisis for world peace. Therefore, based on the spirit of calmness, perseverance, and courage, and determined to protect the country and defend our race, we declare an economic boycott against Japan, urge the Japanese to repent, and properly plan relief measures to relieve the suffering of overseas Chinese. The work of the Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Association has been carried out fiercely for a month, and patriots throughout the country are becoming more and more enthusiastic. The safety of the country depends on this. This council, etc., serve the last teachings of the Prime Minister, and are deeply aware of the great righteousness of the nation and the people. I am saddened by the Japanese people's slavery and I am determined to share the same hatred. Therefore, I am encouraged to promote dullness and willing to die in advance. Within ten days, all Japanese goods, inspections, investigations, and other work, no one is to blame for my promotion as a part-time anti-Japanese and aid-overseas Chinese workers. The workers are working hard to pay attention to it and are more concerned about the concerted efforts of all sectors of society. It is known that anti-Japanese and aid-overseas Chinese will be successful. This is something that our four hundred million compatriots cannot forget, and we must continue to encourage ourselves deeply and support them, so as to wait for the final cleansing of the shame of history and the restoration of the freedom of the nation. However, the Japanese people know that if our people rise up for national affairs and unanimously resist, their national economy and people's livelihood will fall into a desperate situation. Therefore, they do not hesitate to despise public law and brazenly send troops to cross the border to kidnap people and loot goods, obstructing the anti-Japanese movement of our people and enticing Chinese merchants who are eager to profit to fabricate rumors and slanders in order to take the opportunity to destroy the progress of anti-Japanese and aid-overseas Chinese work. These merchants are profiteering and ingratiating. It is not possible to hold them responsible for maintaining national sovereignty and safeguarding national interests, nor is it what they want to hear. If they are enticed by interests, they will not hesitate to sacrifice all national and people's welfare for the sake of it. This is the cause of the failure of previous economic boycotts against Japan. The people of the country cannot help but think about how to eliminate this cause to stop this movement. I have something to say to the merchants of the whole country: There is only service and responsibility in the anti-Japanese movement, and there is nothing to admire for wealth and honor. Those who do not have the determination to work hard to bring China to independence and freedom cannot bear it. The pain of our past failures is still vivid. In the future, the planning should be that all sectors should take the lead as the pioneers of the people and strive to organize strictly and handle affairs openly. If our national and people's interests will not be monopolized by a few profiteers, in order to the fullest extent, if today's anti-Japanese movement is not only a national weapon to overthrow Japanese imperialism, but also a driving force for the revitalization of Chinese industry, the meaning is clear, and it is almost agreed upon by people all over the world. If we can stick to it firmly and carry it out far, we will be able to bring China to the realm of freedom and equality. There is no doubt that at this time, domestic goods will sell well, trade will flourish, and our merchants' interests will not be enjoyed by their descendants for generations to come. The hearts of this association are in danger, so they can't help but express it in a very urgent way. The rights and wrongs and interests are only known to the fathers, elders, sons and younger brothers of the whole country. We hereby declare it for your consideration.</p>

The Huai-Tai and Lu-Tai roads are accessible only by boat, with over 30,000 civilian houses collapsed, and countless people and livestock drowned.

The disaster victims are gathered on the roofs of collapsed houses, or sheltering by the railway tracks, or perched on trees on wooden frames. It is estimated that there are over ten thousand households, with a population of about thirty thousand, all exposed to the wind and rain, without clothing or food, in a miserable state. We implore you to conduct an inspection and provide universal relief." (4) A letter from the Tongshan County Flood Relief Committee in Jiangsu states: "Tongshan is located on the coast, and the people are mostly poor. Since July, there has been continuous rain, and after August 1st, there was torrential rain for several days. Inside and outside the city, there is extensive flooding, with water reaching the waist in deep areas and the knees in shallow areas. Crops are submerged, and houses have collapsed. All the disaster victims are living outdoors, without clothing, food, or shelter, in the most miserable situation. Urgent relief is needed, and we pray for swift assistance." (5) A letter from Xinghua County, Jiangsu, states: "Before autumn, all three dams in Xingyi collapsed, causing a rare disaster. Hundreds of thousands of people are desperate for food, and their homes have been washed away. The refugees are miserably perched on trees and rooftops, crying out in the wilderness, which is unbearable to hear. Please send personnel to distribute emergency relief and save the disaster victims who are awaiting death."</p>
<p>▲ Red Cross Society</p>
<p>Since the discovery of floods in various provinces, the Chinese Red Cross Society has received numerous letters and telegrams requesting relief.

<p>▲ Wuhu Righteous Relief Association</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Newspaper Office, for transfer to various charitable organizations and Anhui associations in various provinces, Greetings. Since the sky has sent down great calamity, and that various provinces are notifying that they are seeing water disasters accounts for nearly half the country, and the severity of the disaster, and the vastness of the disaster area, is even more frightening to hear, and Anhui province is the most severe. Wuhu and Kunlian counties and other places are impacted by the huge waves of the Yangtze River from the outside, and receive the rushing torrents of mountain floods from Jing, Jing, Tai, Shi, and Jixi counties from the inside. Around July 20th, heavy rain poured down for more than ten days, day and night. Outside rivers and inside rivers overflowed at the same time, resulting in tens of dikes in Shen, Gong, Luo, and Gong along the view in Xixiang, Xuancheng, the largest Jinbao dike in Beixiang, and large and small dikes, the largest Lindu dike in the northeast of Nanling, Taifeng, more than ten dikes such as Yu and Shangxia Yixing, the largest Dagong dike in Dangtu, and Hongtan Zhelin Fuding Changmao and other dikes, more than ten dikes such as Mapu Fenglin Dai Nan Shanrui in Nanxiang, Wuhu, Xinxin dikes in Beixiang, the largest Baoda dike in Dongxiang, Fanchang, and dozens of dikes such as Yongqing Yongfeng Xinding Tianbao, collapsed one after another. Houses collapsed, livestock drifted, and they were exposed to the sun and rain and had nowhere to rest. The magnitude of the disaster was only seen after the 29th year of Daoguang in the former Qing Dynasty. One or two hundred shops and households were destroyed in Xihe Town, Xuancheng, and three or four hundred people were drowned, which was particularly tragic. More than two-thirds of the fields in Wuhu County were flooded, and refugees from all over the country gathered there, making the situation extremely important. Except for a small number of mountain fields, the dikes in Dangtu and Fanchang counties were almost completely washed away. In total, the disaster areas in the above-mentioned counties span hundreds of miles, and there are no nearby familiar dikes that can help with work and food. In the aftermath of this disaster, cries of despair are heard everywhere, and people are calling for help. In order to curb chaos and protect people's lives, a large amount of relief funds must be distributed. In addition to setting up flood relief associations in various counties, fellow townsmen in Wuhu, based on the spirit of mutual aid, organized the Wuhu Righteous Relief Association in the Yuying Institute on Second Street according to the case of the 16th year. Zhai Fengxiang and others were publicly elected as standing committee members to raise funds and announce the flood emergency relief in the five counties of Xuancheng, Dangtu, and Fanchang to broaden support and assist. We earnestly ask you to have compassion and provide relief so that the disaster victims in the five counties can enjoy your benevolence and prolong their lives. The standing committee members of the Wuhu Righteous Relief Association, Zhai Fengxiang, etc., respectfully present.</p>
<p>▲ Sichuan Fellow Townsmen Association</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Townsmen Association sent a telegram to the Shanghai Famine Relief Associations for Various Provinces, the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, and the Chinese Red Cross Society: "The floods in our province this time, truly a once in a lifetime event, have already been reported. Recently, we received a telegram from the Chengdu-Chongqing public groups. According to investigations from various parties, the flooded area covers more than one hundred counties. Except for the relatively mild disaster in northern Sichuan, the rest of eastern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and western Sichuan have suffered a rare disaster that has not been seen in a hundred years. Taking western Sichuan as an example, the Sijin River and the Fu River flooded at the same time, causing boats to sail in Chengdu. In the counties of western Sichuan, most families have also been destroyed. Taking southern Sichuan as an example, the Zinei Longlu area was flooded by mountain torrents, causing the cities to be five or six feet deep, and the farmhouses in the villages are empty. Taking eastern Sichuan as an example, all the places through which the Yangtze River passes are unbearable to witness. In Chongqing alone, hundreds of old people and children have been drowned. In other places, only people, livestock, and houses are seen floating in the river. In this situation, if people from home and abroad do not work together to rescue them, the general population may not have any hope of survival. Your association's fundraising for the flood disaster is extremely righteous and brave. We hope that you will allocate emergency relief to Sichuan as soon as possible to rescue the disaster victims from the sea of suffering. We respectfully send another telegram and earnestly wait for your benevolence. The Sichuan Association in Shanghai bows and presents."</p>

<h3 id="e106">Labor Bureau Chief Wang Renlin's Opinions on the Implementation of the Factory Law <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>According to the National Society, after the National Government implemented the Factory Law on August 1, various opinions have emerged. A reporter from the National Society visited Wang Renlin, the acting director of the China Branch of the International Labor Bureau, yesterday to inquire about his opinions. He kindly answered them one by one. The main points are summarized below: (1) Our country's Factory Law is indeed the most progressive social legislation, and its purpose is to improve the employment conditions of workers and promote social welfare, which is beneficial to both labor and capital. Unfortunately, a few employers still express opposition, believing that the implementation of this law only increases the burden on the factory. For example, silk industry employers believe that silk factories are different from other industries, and they are currently in a sluggish period, requesting that the factory regulations that hinder the silk factory industry be modified. In my opinion, their requests are only based on ordinary concepts and not on scientific concepts. The standard of living depends entirely on the amount of production, and the amount of production depends entirely on the efficiency of the workers' work and the factory's management. If the workers' efficiency is high and scientific management is added, the amount of production will naturally increase, and the standard of living will also increase accordingly. Now, many factories in our country have poor management, often causing intangible losses to raw materials, reducing worker efficiency, lowering production, and sluggish sales. Therefore, if we want to remedy this problem, we must implement scientific management. (2) Many employers believe that working long hours can increase output, but they do not know that under the poor factory management conditions in our country, working long hours can not only fail to increase output but also reduce it. Now, whether they are economists or enlightened factory employers, they have all publicly recognized the benefits of short hours. Short hours of work can increase the efficiency of workers, and the quality and quantity of products can also achieve better results. The Yuncheng Yarn Factory in Tianjin has adopted an eight-hour system and has achieved excellent results. The result is reduced costs and increased production per worker. Many silk and cotton factories in Shanghai have reduced their hours from twelve to ten, and the results have been quite satisfactory. (3) There is no doubt that child labor should be abolished. However, under the competitive system of industry and commerce, child labor is inevitable. Since it cannot be avoided, the only way to remedy it is to take restrictive measures. Our country's Factory Law sets the minimum age for child labor at fourteen years old, which can be said to be in line with the proper development of child labor in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical health. If child labor is under fourteen years old, their bodies have not yet fully developed. If they are overworked, their health will inevitably be affected, and they will suffer for the rest of their lives. When they are young, it is the time to study, not only for their own personal advancement but also for the education that a citizen should receive. If they are made to work in a factory, it is tantamount to depriving them of the opportunity to study. If they lose their education when they are young, they will become ignorant people when they grow up, which is not a blessing for society. Children under the age of fourteen have not yet developed their knowledge and experience and are most easily tempted by the outside world. At this age, they should be sent to school to receive moral cultivation. If they are made to work with adult workers, it is inevitable that unscrupulous workers will lead them down an improper path, that is, they will fall into depravity. Therefore, children under the age of fourteen, from the perspective of morality, intelligence, and physical health, are not considered workers. It is hoped that employers can understand the good intentions of the legislators and the health of the future citizens and quickly dismiss the child labor they have already hired. Female workers are also an important issue. Currently, countless female workers work very hard and earn very little. The reason is that they are uneducated, have no industrial training, and have no solidarity to protect themselves. The current Factory Law provides protection for them. According to the provisions of this law, female workers' night work is an example of prohibition, but later, fearing that the operation would be too hasty, on the one hand, the industrial industry would be affected, and on the other hand, about 80,000 to 90,000 female workers would be unemployed, which is not a blessing for society, so it was postponed for two years. However, the harm of night work to health and morality, and the fact that the output is far inferior to day work, has long been recognized by the world. Therefore, it is hoped that employers can understand this point and gradually eliminate night work. Before the implementation of this law, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent personnel to investigate the industrial conditions in various places. The result was that the implementation of this law would not hinder the development of our country's immature industry, so it did not allow the factory's request for extension and resolutely implemented it. However, in order to suit the current industrial situation, the implementation of Article 13, which prohibits female workers from working at night, was postponed for two years, and Article 18, which provides for wages to be paid during vacations and rest days, and the issue of the qualifications and number of representatives of capital in Chapter 10 on factory meetings, were sent to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. It is hoped that the Judicial Yuan will understand the actual situation of our country's immature industry, find a way to remedy it, and make a satisfactory explanation. As for the implementation issues, according to the provisions of Article 2 of the Factory Law, the municipal government social bureaus in various places are the agencies for inspecting and implementing the law. In order to implement the law, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially established a training institute for inspection personnel in Shanghai to train factory inspectors. It is heard that the training period will be completed soon, and they will be distributed to the construction bureaus of various provinces and the social bureaus of various cities to be responsible for the local factory inspection work. However, the situation in Shanghai is slightly different from that in the mainland. Most of the factories are located in the concessions. However, on the day the Factory Law was first implemented, the Public Concession Board of Works issued a statement expressing its extreme support for the principles of the Factory Law, but believing that the scope of the law was too broad, it believed that it must go through a considerable period of time before the standards stipulated in the law could be adopted. Our country's current treatment of factories in the concessions, in addition to striving to recover extraterritoriality, can only hope that the concession authorities will cooperate with our country's government to prevent the hardworking workers who live by sweat and blood from being exploited by selfish capitalists. In order to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Factory Law and cooperate with the concessions, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially requested the International Labor Bureau to send experts to China to guide the implementation and inspection of the Factory Law. This expert has already set off and will arrive in China in early September. It is hoped that the factories established by Chinese and foreigners in the concessions can cooperate sincerely, so that Shanghai workers and Chinese industry can benefit from it. Taking a holistic view, the current Factory Law is quite popular with society, because its purpose is to seek welfare for society. The National Government's resolute implementation of this law has won the support of the Chinese people. In terms of the industrial situation and the employment conditions of workers in our country today, the Factory Law is urgently needed. I very much hope that this matter can be gradually and fully implemented, so that both labor and capital can benefit. It is hoped that Chinese employers can cater to the trend and seek welfare for workers, not only will the relationship between labor and capital be harmonious, and production will increase, but social evolution will also be assisted. It is hoped that Chinese factories can adopt scientific management methods, so that not only can Chinese industry be developed, but the benefits that can be obtained from the implementation of this law can compensate for the temporary losses suffered by the factory in the initial implementation of the Factory Law.</p>

<p>▲ Then Deceiving Her of Her Wealth</p>
<p>▲ And Then Poisoning Her to Death</p>
<p>Yang Jun, a native of Yancheng, filed a lawsuit with the local court yesterday, accusing Wu Huating, who works at the Edison Electric Light Factory in Caojiadu, of seducing his wife, Yang Zhang, deceiving her of her wealth, and poisoning her to death. The lawsuit roughly states that his wife was seduced by Wu and had an affair, and after deceiving her of more than one hundred yuan of her wages, he mixed opium into her rice, causing her to be poisoned after eating it. She was sent to the Red Cross Hospital and died on the 11th of this month, etc. However, the court did not report for an autopsy. This case also involves bizarre circumstances, so it has been ordered to surrender to the case, clarify the situation, and then review it.</p>

<p>Eats His Fill at a Snack Shop at the Train Station</p>
<p>▲ Unexpectedly, He Was Discovered by the Girl's Sister</p>
<p>▲ Lawyer Yan Utters a Clever Argument in Court</p>
<p>▲ Watery Autumn Waves Dazzle the Soul</p>
<p>Xu Zuoqin, a native of Suzhou who lives on Guangqi Road in the city, ordered his daughter, Xu Jiazhen, on the 16th of this month at around 2:00 PM to deliver something to a relative's house. Jiazhen is only fifteen years old, with a beautiful appearance, and her emotions are just beginning to open up, and she already understands the meaning of romance. So, as soon as she left the house, she met Li Shuiquan, a Taoist from Suzhou who lived next door, aged twenty. Because they were neighbors, they knew each other. Li approached and talked to Xu's mother, and Li seduced Xu's daughter with sweet words, and together they went to room 324 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel next to the racetrack on Fuzhou Road, and their virginity was broken. The next morning, they went to the North Railway Station, intending to take a train to another place. They first ate their fill at a snack shop on Jielu Road near the station. Unexpectedly, it was the girl's sister who happened to run into them. After the girl's father discovered that Jiazhen had not returned home all night, he sent his sister to search everywhere, fearing that his sister had been abducted by bandits to another place. Therefore, early in the morning, he went to the area around the North Railway Station to look for her. Later, because her stomach was rumbling with hunger, she also went to the snack shop to eat her fill, and thus ran into them unexpectedly. She reported to Hua police officer No. 524 and detective Wang Xi, who brought Xu and Li Shuiquan together to the Huisi Police Station. After the head of the police station questioned them, he learned the truth, and ordered the police to send Xu to the hospital to verify that Xu's hymen had been broken and that she had been raped. The police brought them back and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, Li was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, stated the case, saying that the defendant Li Shuiquan was prosecuted for raping a girl under the age of sixteen in violation of Article 240 of the Criminal Code. Then, Xu Zuoqin, the girl's father, and the girl's sister successively filed a case, reporting the details and requesting severe punishment. Xu Jiazhen also claimed that she was induced to lose her virginity by the defendant. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he was a neighbor of the plaintiff and had known each other for a long time. He also met Xu from time to time, and they had mutual affection. The other day, Xu asked me to go to the inn together, and all the expenses were paid by Xu, etc. Finally, the court appointed lawyer Yan Luqing to defend the defendant. Lawyer Yan's defense was humorous and outrageous, and quite worthy of admiration. He claimed that after observing Xu's body, her development was complete, and she was undoubtedly eighteen years old. Furthermore, Xu's father, Zuoqin, could not accurately state his daughter's age. Furthermore, reading Xu's pair of watery autumn waves really felt like they were dazzling the soul. Even this lawyer, when he saw them, felt uneasy. In view of the above circumstances, this is indeed Xu's initiative to invite. Declare her innocent. After Judge Feng Shide verified the供词, he ordered the defendant to be detained pending a retrial next Tuesday. Xu will be temporarily detained in the women's detention center.</p>

<p>▲ The One Who Eloped Was a Friend in the Store</p>
<p>▲ Arrested in Shanghai After Returning from Hankou</p>
<p>Yin Linying, daughter of Yin Genfu, a Suzhou native and the owner of Yongxing Ivory Shop, No. 83 Houjiabang, South City, has a small appearance. Last year, her father promised her to a certain surname to be a wife, but she has not yet married. However, Linying is twenty-two years old, and her emotions have opened up early, so she is not used to being alone in the empty room. On April 9th of this year, she rolled up her clothes, jewelry, and one hundred and twenty yuan in cash and two hundred taels of silver, and eloped with Bao Arong, a native of Wuxi and also twenty-two years old. Fearing that the incident would be discovered and arrested, they took a boat to Hankou and other places and lived together for several months. Recently, they returned to Shanghai. After Linying ran away, she was extremely anxious. In addition, Linying's husband's family often came to make trouble, accusing Genfu of colluding to sell his daughter. Therefore, although he sent out detectives everywhere, he was ultimately like a stone sinking into the sea, with no trace. Then he reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, asking them to investigate. Until 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, the detective Wang Shenqing of the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered that Linying and Bao were living together at No. 1216 Shouwenyi Road in the Public Concession. He then joined Tao Afu, the Chinese detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, to arrest Bao and Yin. They were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, stated the case, saying that the transfer layer has been submitted by the Public Security Bureau with evidence, which indicates their agreement. Then, Wang Shenqing, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, submitted an official document requesting the transfer. Yin Genfu, the girl's father, also complained about the previous situation. After Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confessions, he ordered the two defendants to be taken back by Wang Shenqing, an official from the Public Security Bureau, and sent back to the case for interrogation.</p>

Kennedy, the superintendent in charge of the Indian police, testified that the defendant was previously a doorkeeper and patrol officer and had not committed any violations at the time. The defendant Joe stated that he had never married the woman and also stated that before being transferred to the Public Concession Police Station, he had given 40 yuan to the water patrol to transfer to the woman because the woman's father demanded 100 yuan and others advised him to give 40 yuan, so he entrusted the water patrol to transfer the money. However, water patrol officer Finch Reis said that he did not receive the money. The case will be continued tomorrow morning (20th).</p>

<p>▲ American Commander to Convene Court-Martial</p>
<p>According to the American Evening Post, a first-class engine room artificer named Lawson deserted from the US Asiatic Fleet submarine tender USS Canopus while it was undergoing repairs in Shanghai in June. Only yesterday (the 18th) was he finally captured by shore patrolmen from the US Navy at 662 Lafayette Road, and he is being held in custody at the US Marine Corps headquarters. He will soon be sent to Qingdao, where a court-martial will be convened on his original ship to try him for desertion. It is reported that after Lawson left the ship, he went to Harbin, and two weeks ago, he sneaked back to Shanghai and rented a room at 662 Lafayette Road. However, due to his bad behavior, the landlady disliked him and reported him to the American authorities on Monday night. When the patrolmen went to arrest him yesterday, Lawson was inside, barefoot and bare-chested, drinking beer. Surprised by the sudden arrival of the captors, he did not have time to put on his shoes and hurriedly climbed onto the roof from the second-floor window. The patrolmen also climbed onto the roof and pursued him. After a while, Lawson escaped the pursuers and sneaked into the neighboring room through a small window to hide. Unexpectedly, before he could catch his breath, he was spotted by a servant. The patrolmen heard the sound and rushed over. Lawson climbed back onto the roof from the window of the neighboring room and returned to his own room. Unexpectedly, just as he was descending from the roof and grabbing the window frame, the pursuers entered the room from downstairs and apprehended him. He was then transferred from the French Concession police station to the Hongkou police station, and then to the US Marine Corps headquarters.</p>

<p>▲ Numerous Suspects, Complex Content</p>
<p>Zhang Aliu from Songjiang previously used a counterfeit five-yuan banknote to buy one yuan of soap at a shop owned by a Westerner named Belot on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession and asked for four yuan in change. He was discovered, arrested, and sent to the police station. Later, detectives Tao Desheng and Bao Tan Wang Zhihao, based on Zhang's confession, successively arrested ten accomplices: Wu Jinsheng, Wang Rongsheng, Gu Jinchun, Gu Wangshi, Gu Genlin, Yao Yixin, Ye Chenshi, Cai Huafei, and Li Tiedan.

<h3 id="e116">Dispute Over Demolition and Reconstruction of Yongcheng Lane Houses on Guoging Road <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>▲ Female Tenants Petition En Masse</p>
<p>A dispute arose over the demolition and reconstruction of houses in Yongcheng Lane on Guoging Road in Zhabei. At 10:00 am the day before yesterday, a total of 306 female second-hand landlords gathered and went to the Fu Yuanzhuang estate of Qin Runqing on Ningbo Road in the Public Concession to request a postponement of the demolition. The following is a detailed account of the situation: Yongcheng Lane has over 400 houses in the New, Old, and Middle sections, divided into 306 rented households. It was originally the property of Ye Chengzhong and was later transferred to the management of Fu Yuan, Fu Kang, and other estates for rent collection for eight or nine years. The original rent was eleven yuan per Shikumen house and six yuan per Dongyang room. Over the years, the rent for Shikumen houses increased to fifteen yuan, and the rent for Dongyang rooms increased to ten yuan. The motive for the reconstruction was that on November 20th of last year, a loft in No. 17 suddenly collapsed, injuring two people. The landlord, citing the dilapidated condition of the houses, notified the tenants to move out in February of this year and planned to start reconstruction on May 1st. However, the tenants repeatedly objected, arguing that the rent had only recently been increased and demanding that the reconstruction be postponed for three years. Mediation was ineffective. Gu Zhuxuan acted as a mediator, but both sides held their ground, and mediation was ineffective. The landlord, seeing that the tenants had not moved out, issued another notice, setting a deadline of August 20th for moving out, with demolition to begin immediately. After receiving the notice, the tenants panicked and held a meeting, deciding to demand that the landlord postpone the demolition until February of next spring, citing the lack of places to move to. Petition Process At 10:00 am the day before yesterday, a total of 306 female second-hand landlords gathered at Fu Yuanzhuang, demanding that the landlord allow the demolition to be postponed until February. At that time, the manager of the estate was not present. Fearing that the crowd would cause trouble, he immediately notified the police by telephone. Western and Chinese detectives were dispatched to the estate to suppress the situation. Then, the estate sent people to persuade the petitioning women to return and await a resolution. Landlord's Statement It is said that the landlord, hearing that the tenants claimed they had nowhere to move, was willing to first build simple houses north of the Sun Temple in Zhabei and rent them to the tenants at a low price. After the new houses in the lane were completed, they would be rented to the tenants again. However, the tenants insisted on their previous proposal, and the matter remains unresolved.</p>

<p>▲ Jin Fuxiang is Heartless</p>
<p>Shen Songshi, a woman from Jiaxing, is 32 years old. Since her husband passed away in the spring of the year before last, she has been a widow for two years. Fortunately, she has a daughter named Dabao, who is now 14 years old. Mother and daughter work for a living and depend on each other. Unexpectedly, in April of this year, Jin Fuxiang from Zhuji, Zhejiang, stayed in Jiaxing, unable to find work, and repeatedly seduced her. Before long, she was deceived into an affair. Jin, seeing that the family consisted of only the mother and daughter, took advantage of the situation and openly lived with her as husband and wife. Jin, accustomed to extravagance, relied on Shen's labor to make a living during the day and had an affair at night. Still not satisfied, he suddenly had a wild idea at the end of last month and falsely asked Shen, "It's not a long-term solution to continue like this. I have many friends in Shanghai. Why don't we go to Shanghai together and ask a friend to introduce us to work? The salary is much higher than here." Shen was again taken in and accompanied her daughter to Shanghai, temporarily residing in a new house in North Caoji宅 in West Shanghai. All expenses were covered by pawning the clothes Shen's daughter brought with her. Jin deceived Shen every day, saying that he was asking a friend to help find a position and that it would be available soon. After two weeks, all the clothes were pawned, and Jin had secretly made arrangements to sell Shen's daughter. The day before yesterday, Jin suddenly led two people to see the daughter, which Shen discovered. Shen questioned Jin sternly, but Jin responded rudely and forcefully. Shen, having only this daughter, was extremely angry and immediately went to the Sixth District Police Station to report the matter. The police were dispatched to bring Jin and the second-hand landlord, as witnesses, to the station for questioning. After District Chief Ren questioned them separately and confirmed the facts, he determined that the case involved the seduction of a widow and the selling of a young girl, which was illegal. He immediately prepared a document and sent it to the Local Court for investigation.</p>

<p>▲ The Corpse Has Not Yet Been Examined</p>
<p>▲ The Party Headquarters Sent Personnel for Secret Investigation</p>
<p>A-Hua, son of Wang Fengzhou, a villager from Lu Qitang Village in Yuepu Township, northwest of Wusong, was introduced to work as a servant at Gao Yisheng's house in Nan Xu Jia Wan, Zhanghuabang, south of Songnan, on May 19th. Suddenly, in early June, he was beaten to death and his body was dumped in a small river. Later, he was spotted by his fellow villager Tang Arong, who reported it to the family. Wang Fengzhou reported it to the First Branch of the Seventh Public Security District, and the suspect Gao Yisheng was arrested and transferred to the Local Court for investigation. These facts were previously reported in this newspaper. The case has been heard in court once. The plaintiff, Wang Fengzhou, entrusted lawyer Wu Zhiping to draft a petition, and the defendant, Gao Yisheng, was defended by lawyer Yuan Xilian. After the interrogation, Gao Yisheng was released on bail, but Wang A-Hua's body has not yet been examined, and his father, Wang Fengzhou, has not received any instructions, so the case has not been resolved. Wang Fengzhou, feeling that injustice has not been redressed, submitted a petition to the Third Branch of the Eighth District Party Headquarters yesterday morning, requesting justice and assistance. After receiving the petition, the Third Branch immediately forwarded it to the First District Party Headquarters, which has secretly dispatched cadres to the vicinity of the incident site to thoroughly investigate the truth.</p>

<p>▲ Western Tourists Enthusiastically Help Rescue</p>
<p>▲ Excessive Water Ingestion Made Recovery Impossible</p>
<p>Near the Jiangbei shanties near the Wusong Fort Taiwan 洋碼头, recently, a group of children have often been playing and bathing in the river by the sea. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 pm, four children were bathing there. While they were having fun, a child named Ding Arong, 8 years old, from Suqian, whose father, Ding Jiang, worked as a coolie at the Yong'an Yarn Factory, and whose mother, Wei, was at home, suddenly lost his support and sank to the bottom of the sea. The other children saw this and rushed to his house to report. By the time his mother and neighbors arrived, they pulled him out of the water. At that time, the child had only a breath left. His mother held him ashore. A convertible car drove up, and a Westerner and a Chinese in Western clothes were sitting inside. The Westerner immediately jumped out of the car when he saw the situation and grabbed the child in his arms, using artificial respiration and various rescue methods to try to save him. The Chinese also helped with the rescue. The two took turns giving air, but the child had ingested too much water and could not be saved. The Westerner injured his hand and broke the skin while administering aid. He didn't care, the two gave more than an hour of assistance, but saw it was hopeless and stopped with a sigh. His mother cried by the body and mourned, so the Westerner gave her three yuan and told her to buy a coffin and take care of the funeral.</p>

<p>Shen Dongsheng, a local, used to be a painter at the Yangshupu Road Waterworks Company. He asked for leave from the foreman, Jin Yigen from Chongming, due to illness and went to Wuxi to recuperate. His position was revoked, and he asked Jin to request a pension from the Western director, but it was unsuccessful. He was angered by Jin Yigen deliberately dismissing him. At about 6:00 am on the 1st of this month, he waited on Taopeng Road with a knife to make trouble and vent his anger, but he accidentally injured Jin's vital parts. He died despite medical treatment. At that time, Shen Dongsheng turned himself in to the Yangshupu police station. The details of the interrogation by the First Special Court have been reported in this newspaper. The debate has ended and the verdict is pending. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Shen Dongsheng to a reduced sentence of ten years imprisonment. The number of days of pre-trial detention was converted to reduce the sentence by one day for every two days of detention. The murder weapon, a knife, was confiscated.</p>

<p>▲ No Trace of the Sunken Ship Has Been Found Either</p>
<p>According to the American Evening Post, as of this afternoon (19th), Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. in this port has still not received any confirmed news about the loss of the Guang Sheng steamer. Although a telegram was received this morning stating that three bodies, presumably from the ship, had been washed ashore on Fuyang Island (transliteration) by huge waves and buried by the residents, the British warship sent personnel to exhume and examine them, but they were unable to determine their names or whether they were Westerners or Chinese. The telegram did not mention this. According to fishermen, a red smokestack steamer was hit by wind and rain on Monday and sank near the island, but the British warship and the company's Fu Sheng steamer searched the area near the island in detail and still found no trace of the sunken ship. It was also rumored that the owner of the Guang Sheng steamer, the Englishman Hunter, had been rescued and was now living in Funing, but the company sent a telegram to inquire and had not received any confirmation as of this morning.</p>

<p>▲ Ministry Orders Each Maritime Affairs Bureau to Investigate, Discuss, and Report</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Shipping Association previously stated that merchant ships were registered and licensed by the Ministry of Communications and registered and issued licenses by each Customs, and if they were to pay a registration fee of 4/1000 of the value again, it would be too much of a burden. In July, they submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to be exempted from paying again. They then received an order that the request was not approved and were instructed to persuade all shipping merchants to comply. After repeated discussions by the Executive Committee of the Association, it was decided that all ships that had already received Customs licenses and all ships built in the future would be allowed to pay half the fee, while ships purchased later would pay the full fee in accordance with the regulations, in order to promote consideration and meet the needs of both parties. The Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau requesting them to forward it. It is now known that the Maritime Affairs Bureau has received an instruction from the Ministry of Communications, stating that it has been ordered to instruct each Maritime Affairs Bureau to investigate, discuss, and report their opinions in detail. It is noted that the Maritime Affairs Bureaus that have been established include Shanghai, Hankou, Harbin, and other places. The directors of each bureau are well aware of the difficulties faced by Chinese merchant shipping and will surely understand the methods requested by the shipping merchants in Shanghai, in order to consider both the government and merchants and comfort the expectations of shipping merchants nationwide.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Jiangzhe Silk Industry Public Bond Management Methods <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>▲ Issuance Procedures for Public Bonds Have Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>▲ Earnest Commitment Required to Receive Bonds</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe Silk Industry Public Bonds have been issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, and distributed according to the number of silk reeling machines. Regarding the issuance procedures, the Silk Industry Public Bond Executive Committee and the Custody Committee have already reached an agreement yesterday. The method for improving silk factory machinery has also been revised by the Ministry of Industry. Starting yesterday, the Jianghai Customs Office, by order, will collect public bond funds of thirty yuan per load for the shipment of Shuang Gong silk overseas. The details of each item are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Directives from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to the Jiangzhe Silk Industry Public Bond Executive Committee: Your submission and attachments have been carefully reviewed. The submitted survey tables of Jiangzhe silk factories are quite detailed. The four million yuan of public bonds for promoting raw silk exports are approved to be distributed according to the standards set by the Executive Committee. The Custody Committee should verify and issue the bonds based on the roster and seals of each factory to provide relief. However, the purpose of these public bonds is to maintain the operation of silk factories, promote foreign raw silk trade, and prevent silk factory workers from becoming unemployed. Therefore, before issuing the public bonds, the Custody Committee should require each factory to solemnly pledge that after receiving the bonds, they will strive to improve and rectify their operations. If there is any negligence or suspension of business under any pretext, it will be strictly dealt with upon discovery. You must immediately inform the manufacturers to comply, so as to live up to the government's intention to relieve the silk industry. The proposed methods for improving machinery in the fundamental solution have been revised and are attached for your compliance. However, which types of machinery the silk factory intends to improve, when they will be purchased, when they will be installed, and how much they will cost should be detailed in a plan, listed in a detailed table, and submitted to the Executive Committee for review and approval. When the installation is complete, the Executive Committee will send personnel to inspect and verify that it complies with the approved plan, and then report it to the Ministry. After the Ministry dispatches personnel to re-examine and confirm that there are no errors, the Ministry will notify the Custody Committee of the amount of subsidy to be issued separately, so as to ensure that the implementation is effective and the results are substantial. The proposed methods for improving sericulture are not without merit. However, as it concerns a long-term plan, it should be carried out step by step after the start, persevering with determination and aiming for long-term results, accumulating gradually to achieve success. The Executive Committee's distribution of funds, the number of years it will be limited to, and how it will be managed after several years have not been taken into account, which seems to be a oversight. After the promulgation of the Jiangzhe Silk Industry Public Bond Regulations, the Ministry of Industry planned to establish a Central Sericulture Experiment Station for the fundamental solution of improving sericulture. It also planned to establish a silkworm egg production center and a silk reeling factory within the Experiment Station. The charter and budget have been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record. The methods for improving sericulture proposed by your committee should be based on the aforementioned established plan, and should be unified under the Ministry of Industry and handed over to the Central Sericulture Experiment Station for reference, so as to facilitate the process and make it easier to achieve long-term results. In addition to ordering the Custody Committee, you should also comply with and report the situation of the public bonds for temporary relief and the improvement of machinery at any time for examination. This is an order.</p>

The list shall state the type of machinery to be improved, the type of style to be adopted, the number of machines, where to purchase the machinery, the total price of the machinery, and when it is estimated that the installation can be completed. (B) Upon receiving the silk factory's report, the Executive Committee shall thoroughly review it with technical personnel. If it is deemed appropriate, it shall be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for approval and notified to the factory to proceed. If the Executive Committee deems the silk factory's report to be inadequate, it may notify the factory to correct it. (C) Upon receiving the Executive Committee's notification that it has been approved by the Ministry of Industry, the silk factory shall carry out the installation.

(D) The deadline for reporting the installation is within four months from the date of implementation of these methods. The deadline for installation is within eight months after the Ministry's order is approved. (E) The above refers to the manufacturer being the factory owner. If the manufacturer and the factory owner are separate, in addition to handling matters according to the provisions not specified in this article, the manufacturer shall be given priority in handling the installation. The deadline shall be two months. (F) If the amount of subsidies is not fully applied for within the reporting deadline, the Ministry may order an extension of the deadline. (5) All Jiangzhe silk factories that have been using cocoon drying machines, fire cocoon machines, silk reeling machines, and silk evenness testing machines that are the same style as specified by the Executive Committee after the implementation of these methods may also report to the Executive Committee and request a subsidy. After the Executive Committee dispatches personnel to investigate and confirm that it is true, it shall report to the Ministry of Industry. After the Ministry dispatches personnel to re-examine and confirm that there are no errors, it shall notify the Custody Committee to issue the subsidy. (6) All Jiangzhe silk factories that have been subsidized shall not resell or transfer the installed machinery.

The amount shall be agreed upon based on the degree of newness or oldness of the machinery. (7) All Jiangzhe silk factories that are unclear on how to use the above-improved machinery may notify the Executive Committee, which shall dispatch technical personnel to provide guidance. (8) To promote the use of various new types of machinery in each factory, the silk factory may request the Executive Committee to train workers. The training methods shall be determined separately by the Ministry. (9) The subsidy amount shall be limited to 1.9 million yuan. The remaining 100,000 yuan shall be used for training and administrative expenses. The budget shall be determined separately by the Ministry. (10) The Executive Committee shall have responsible technical personnel for the implementation of the machinery improvement portion. According to the provisions of Article 5 of the Executive Committee's charter, it may request the Ministry of Industry to dispatch technical personnel from within the Ministry or its affiliated institutions to fill the positions. (11) These methods shall be implemented from the date when the Executive Committee receives the Ministry's order notifying that it has been approved by the Executive Yuan and filed for record.</p>

Therefore, we must comply with it. It is now decided that starting from the 19th of this month, the Silk Industry Public Bond Fund should be collected uniformly for all Shuang Gong silk exported from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, at a rate of 30 yuan of national currency per load. All merchants are hereby notified. This is a special public notice."</p>

<h3 id="e128">Methods for Paying Wages During National Holidays and Memorial Days <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>▲ Approved by the Municipal Government and Replied by the Central Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government previously had many doubts about whether wages should be paid or doubled on national holidays and memorial days, such as (1) If a national holiday falls within a worker's continuous leave, should the worker's wages be paid as usual? (2) If a national holiday falls on a Sunday, should wages be doubled or should a compensatory day off be given? (3) January 1 is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, but it is also the Western New Year's Day and falls during the continuous New Year holiday. Should wages be doubled on this day? It was submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions, which was then forwarded to the Central Government for reply as follows: (1) Article 18 of the Factory Law states that "Wages shall be paid as usual during the rest days and holidays stipulated in Articles 15 to 17." There are no restrictions on the payment of wages during holidays. Since national holidays have been stipulated as paid holidays, the worker's wages should still be paid as usual even if the worker is on continuous leave. (2) The case of annual factory shutdown dates and paid Sunday holidays states that "The method for paid Sunday holidays shall be handled in accordance with legally valid collective agreements or work agreements." Whether wages should be doubled or a compensatory day off should be given if a national holiday falls on a Sunday should be handled in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations, in accordance with legally valid collective agreements or work agreements. If there is no explicit provision in the collective agreement or work agreement, there is no need to double wages or provide a compensatory day off. (3) January 1 is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China and also Western New Year's Day, which is the same date and has two meanings. Since it has been stipulated as a paid holiday, there is no need to double wages. The Executive Yuan has instructed the Shanghai Municipal Government to take note.</p>

<p>▲ The Second Land Requisition Period Has Not Yet Been Determined</p>
<p>Since the first land requisition in the city center area, it has been reported that the municipal government's responsible bureaus are actively carrying out various construction projects and equipment in the area, sparing no effort. Currently, the road boundaries in the area have been determined by the Bureau of Public Works and are being surveyed by the Bureau of Land. The earthwork project for the road surface can be started at the latest in October. The entire woodpile and steel-reinforced concrete foundation of the municipal government's new building project have been completed. The methods for the second land requisition in the city center area are currently being drafted by the Bureau of Land in conjunction with the City Center Area Construction Committee. Once it is submitted to the municipal government for approval, it will be announced. The date for the start of the land requisition has not yet been determined, but it is expected to be around September or October of this year.</p>

<p>▲ Using Industry and Commerce Associations as Organizational Units</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government previously transferred a request from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which had been transferred from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, for an interpretation of Article 14 of the Industry and Commerce Association Law: "Two or more industry and commerce associations may form a federation with the consent of more than two-thirds of their members. If the federated industry and commerce associations belong to the same province, the charter of the federation shall be approved by the provincial government and reported to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for record. If they do not belong to the same province or cross provincial boundaries and municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, they shall be approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce." The legal text refers to two or more industry and commerce associations, meaning that there must be an organization of industry and commerce associations in both Location A and Location B before they can form a federation. If a certain industry in Location A and a certain industry in Location B initiate the formation of a certain industry federation, but there is no organization based on industry and commerce associations within their respective regions, is it legally permissible to establish such a federation? After transferring the request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and then to the Legislative Yuan for reply, the municipal government yesterday received a consultation from the Ministry of Industry, stating that the case had been decided by the Legislative Yuan in a meeting: "The Federation of Industry and Commerce Associations shall still use industry and commerce associations as organizational units and shall not only form a federation of industries in each region." The Social Affairs Bureau was immediately instructed to transfer the instructions to all industry and commerce groups under its jurisdiction to comply with.</p>

<p>The China Ji Sheng Association allocated funds last year to provide work as relief and repaired the Shuang Feng Creek Dike Project in Yuhuan County, Zhejiang Province, formerly under the jurisdiction of Wenzhou. The Yuhuan County Government sent a letter stating that the funds allocated by the association to provide work as relief for the repair of the Shuang Feng Creek water conservancy project were completed by the end of June this year. The project lasted for more than a year and benefited the disaster-stricken people, who praised it widely. Fortunately, the harvest last year was abundant and the people's morale gradually recovered. Those who used to suffer from hunger and cold are now able to barely make ends meet. Thinking of the source of the water, the association's merits are immeasurable. With sincere gratitude, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Improvement of Wheat Seed Varieties <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲ Hoping to Increase Wheat Production</p>
<p>▲ To Solve the Shortage of Raw Materials for Flour Factories</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry, requesting that the Jiangzhe provinces improve wheat seed varieties to recover the outflow losses of various flour factories. The original text is recorded below: "Submitting a request: On the 14th of this month, we received a joint letter from the Flour Factory Association, the Chinese Grain Association, and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Inland Mechanized Flour Factory Association, stating that although the wheat production in our country has been increasing year by year, the demand for raw materials for flour factories is very high. The output of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is only enough for the factories for a few months. For the sake of people's food, we have to use foreign wheat to make up for the shortage. Farmers are accustomed to old habits and do not know how to improve wheat seed varieties, resulting in low yields and poor quality. If we do not find ways to improve, it will have a significant impact on farmers' livelihoods. Our association has established an agricultural experiment field in Wuxi, purchasing foreign wheat seed varieties for cultivation. Over the years, the results have been quite effective. However, due to limited resources, we have been unable to promote it. But we are convinced that we can improve agricultural production. We have also found that the selection and purchase of cotton seeds in Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces has also been effective. Foreign agricultural seeds are also very suitable for planting in the country, in terms of soil and climate. This is not only the case for wheat, but wheat is related to people's food and is more important than other agricultural products. Now that summer has passed and the wheat planting season is approaching, the improvement of agricultural products seems to be urgent. Therefore, we jointly request your association to investigate and request the Ministry of Industry to order the counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to work with agricultural associations to properly formulate regulations and persuade farmers to select and purchase high-quality wheat seeds for timely planting. If you plant melons, you will get melons, and if you plant beans, you will get beans. Next year's harvest will be good. It is reported that there is a committee for the improvement of crops in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the purpose is the same. We hope that the Ministry will consider the people's livelihood and the concerns of the factories, and we cannot refuse the request. The agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors are waiting for the implementation. We are eagerly awaiting orders." The Chamber of Commerce believes that wheat and rice are both staples in the diet of our people, and the area for wheat cultivation is even larger than rice paddies. In recent years, many flour factories have been established, but the supply of raw materials cannot meet the demand, and the quality is not good. Therefore, we rely on the United States and Australia for supply, just like foreign rice. The public request is that the Ministry of Industry should consult with the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to properly advise farmers to select and purchase high-quality wheat seed varieties for widespread cultivation so that the flour factories can be self-sufficient in raw materials, which is a crucial plan for today. However, this matter cannot be achieved by a single order from local officials. Each province must establish multiple wheat seed improvement farms to distribute the high-quality wheat seeds collected each year to nearby rural areas at a low price, so that everyone will know the benefits and change their ways. Each farm should also promote the seeds as much as possible each year, sufficient to meet the needs of farmers, so that the raw materials for flour factories can be completely self-sufficient. We hereby submit the situation to your department for review and hope that you will adopt appropriate measures and send a consultation to the provinces for effective implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Advises Manufacturers to Test Domestic Goods <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲ Research and Improve to Achieve Permanent Boycott</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the industry and commerce associations, advising manufacturers to entrust the testing of industrial goods, so as to research and improve the domestic goods tested and achieve a permanent boycott of foreign goods. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear sirs, We have received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau on the testing of industrial goods, stating that since the Wanbaoshan Incident and the anti-Chinese movement by Koreans, the people of the whole country have been filled with righteous indignation at the conspiracy of Japanese imperialists. Therefore, there is a movement to boycott Japanese goods. However, the boycott of Japanese goods must have corresponding domestic goods to replace them; otherwise, it will inevitably be criticized as a five-minute heat. It will also give the United Kingdom and the United States an opportunity to seize the market, which is not a positive self-reliance strategy. Since its establishment, this institute has been testing raw materials and improving products for the industrial and commercial sectors, which has been trusted by manufacturers in various industries. Currently, there are thousands of items entrusted for testing, as well as more than a dozen research, improvement, or imitation problems, such as mustard oil, flypaper, skin cream, wax cakes, mimeograph paper, copper grease, and buttons, which have been successfully researched by this institute and handed over to the entrusted manufacturers for management. At this time of intense boycott of Japanese goods, it is a good opportunity to promote domestic goods. We believe that manufacturers in various industries must have good plans for promoting domestic goods. If there is a need for research, improvement, or imitation in terms of products, it is the responsibility of this institute to cooperate with manufacturers as much as possible within the possible scope to jointly improve domestic goods so that the boycott can be sustained and industry can be revitalized. We hope that your association will inform the members under your jurisdiction that you are welcome to entrust the testing or research. Thank you very much." The testing and research brochures are attached. "Our country's industry is still in its infancy, and the establishment of the institute is to promote the development of industry. This will allow domestic goods to be improved and can also sustain the boycott of Japanese goods. We have recorded the letter above and are forwarding it to you for your reference."</p>

<p>▲Schools Must Report Before August 31</p>
<p>▲Repair Work Managed by District Offices</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to the primary schools in the county's districts, stating: "Upon reviewing the 205th Bureau Affairs Meeting's discussion on the school building repair project in each district, it was decided that the repair project will be entrusted to the district offices based on the allocated funds for each district in the 20th-year budget. Because the funds allocated to each school for the temporary compulsory education are minimal, we are deeply concerned that annual repairs cannot be carried out school by school. It is necessary to prioritize urgent needs and carry them out in rotation. However, some schools may be unclear about this matter and have incorporated these funds into the equipment procurement fees and submitted them for approval. Now, it has been decided in the 211th Bureau Preliminary Meeting to issue a notice to all schools to list all items that need to be repaired and provide a budget, and submit them to the Education Committee before August 31st, without any delay. The Education Committee will submit a report based on the principal's report, referring to the actual situation of the inspection, and add their comments. The Bureau will send a letter to entrust the district offices to manage the repair work. In accordance with the above, in addition to informing the district offices, this order is for the principals to review and comply with. This order."</p>

<h3 id="e171">Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education's Vocational Facilities Plan for Secondary Schools This Year <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tianling Company Radio Station, to allow citizens to understand Shanghai's municipal plans, requested and was approved by the Municipal Government to have each bureau take turns sending personnel to broadcast lectures. The day before yesterday, it was the Municipal Bureau of Education's turn to broadcast, and Director Xu Peihuang sent Hu Shuyi to deliver a lecture on this topic. The reporter believes that production education is an urgent need for today's society, and hereby reveals it for the research of those concerned about education in this city. (Editor's note)</p>
<p>Brothers, today I represent the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education to lecture on the bureau's vocational facilities plan for secondary schools in the 20th year of the Republic. This lecture is prepared to be divided into three major parts. First, I will talk about the purpose of vocational facilities in the city's secondary schools. Second, I will talk about the plan to add vocational groups to the city's three secondary schools. Finally, I will talk about the bureau's relationship to promoting production education.</p>
<p>Now, let's first establish the purpose of vocational facilities in the city's secondary schools. Everyone understands that education is not the ultimate goal; it can only be said to be a tool for solving the problems that people need to solve. What problems does our country urgently need to solve now? I can briefly say it:</p>
<p>We now feel that society is uneasy and people's hearts are unsettled, mostly due to economic relations. In other words, it is the livelihood issue advocated by our President Sun Yat-sen. If it is not adequately resolved, then in this economically backward situation in China, if we want to save the people, save society, and save the country through education, we must change the original purpose of running education. We know that in the decades of running schools in our country, very few people in society have directly benefited because the schools do not consider the needs of society, and those who run education do not try to meet the needs of society. Therefore, the education sector has created a special class, and the result is that education is education and society is society. In that kind of situation, schools will become marketplaces for selling empty knowledge, and students, at best, will become impractical idealists. The activities in the school will be biased towards the mental aspect, and the activities of manual labor will never be dreamed of. Especially in our country's secondary schools, some people say that once young people enter secondary school, two phenomena will occur. First, they cannot operate. Second, they are unwilling to work hard. Therefore, students who enter secondary school are determined not to go to stores as apprentices, and female secondary school graduates are unwilling to operate at home. Do you think that society now needs this kind of talent who cannot operate and is unwilling to work hard? Therefore, many stores dare not hire secondary school graduates when hiring staff anymore. In the future, their only way out is to go to university; other than that, they are only qualified to be high-level idlers. This is the biggest weakness of current secondary education: there is no meaning of labor and vocational training. This weakness can also be said to violate our President Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of the omnipotence of hands. In the future, if every secondary school student becomes incapable, what hope is there for society and the country at that time? Because the various elements that make up society and the country are all dividing profits instead of creating profits. Now, to remedy this weakness, we must recognize where the needs of our society are and work together towards production-oriented education. Then, perhaps there is still some final hope. The bureau, recognizing this social need, is doing its best to promote production education in the secondary education stage, so that the citizens of Shanghai will receive vocational training in diligence and operation in the future and slowly embark on the path of production. This is the purpose of vocational facilities in the city's secondary schools. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Books in the British Museum</p>
<p>The British Museum, located in Europe, is prestigious. The British Museum is the largest museum in England. Taking only the library section as an example, it has a collection of three million books. If the bookshelves were laid flat on the ground and extended, they would be approximately thirty-five miles long.</p>
<p>A Country with Many Laws</p>
<p>The United States is a country with many laws. They have more than two million types of laws in effect. The most interesting one is a law passed in a certain town in Michigan in December 1923 that prohibits men and women from making eye contact with each other while dancing in public places. Contact is considered a violation of the law. However, this is the easiest thing to violate, and many people have been fined. In addition, in the parliament of a certain southwestern state, it was stipulated that women are prohibited from using powder. Also, in the state of Oklahoma, teaching the development of men and women is a crime. These laws are too strict and almost go too far.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Weihaiwei, Regaining Our Territory <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>In recent years, the more satisfactory of our country's diplomatic negotiations has been the recovery of leased territories, and Qingdao and Weihai are examples of implementing the handover. Weihai's terrain is dangerous, controlling the Bohai Sea, and is an important military town for our country's maritime defense. Since its formal recovery, the government has designated it as an administrative district and established an administrative office. Xu Zushan was appointed as the commissioner. Mr. Xu is both talented in literature and martial arts and is familiar with diplomacy. Since taking office, he has been diligent in governing and making reforms in many ways. Local public security is well-organized, and people can leave their doors unlocked at night. Even though the British are nearby, there are no complaints. The climate is cool, and the scenery is extremely beautiful. It combines the advantages of both Putuo and Mogan Mountains and is the best area to live in and spend the summer. In the central part of the city, Mount Naigu is behind it. At the foot of the mountain is Huan Cui Lou (Green Ring Tower), which is the best place in the county. On clear spring and summer days, you can climb up to watch the sea and occasionally see mirages. However, the building has been around for many years and is gradually collapsing. Now, Commissioner Xu has rebuilt it. From then on, the famous tower and scenic spot will last forever. Once the project is completed, Mr. Zong will write about it specifically, which is also the history of the evolution of Weihai. Therefore, it is recorded to share with readers.</p>
<p>In the spring of the following year after I governed Weihai, I planted trees at the foot of Mount Naigu in the city and then ascended what is called Huan Cui Lou. I saw that it was backed by mountains, surrounded by hills, hanging upside down in the air, and densely populated by thousands of families. The floating scenery seemed boundless. Opposite was Liugong Island, with its solitary peak towering and supporting the middle of the river. The sea surrounded it on three sides, and Liugong Island acted as a screen. It was indeed a natural scenic spot and a strategic area for maritime defense. Looking back at the tower, the blackness of the rotten beams and rafters and the broken tiles were all bare and uneven. It had been abandoned and unrepaired for many years. Leaning on the railing and looking out, I was suddenly saddened. According to the records, the establishment of Weihaiwei was in the late Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty to defend against pirates. During the Yongle period, the city was first built. Later, the city walls collapsed, and Zhao Heling, the deputy envoy of the patrol waterway, rebuilt it. Commander Wang Heng was grateful for Zhao's virtue and donated his salary to build Huan Cui Lou to show its permanence. Grand Secretary Liu was the one who wrote the inscription for it. It was rebuilt during the Shunzhi period of the Qing Dynasty. It collapsed in the forty-seventh year of Kangxi and was rebuilt in the first year of Qianlong. The records of the Weizhi (Weihai Gazetteer) describe the beginning and end of the tower in this way. Since the establishment of Weihaiwei in the early Ming Dynasty to defend against Japan, they knew that there was preparation in the northeast, so they changed their strategy of aggression and disturbed our Fujian and Yue borders. In the middle of the Guangxu period, Li Hongzhang supervised Zhili and opened Weihai as a military port, establishing a naval admiral to be stationed on Liugong Island. During the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese surprised us. On one side, they attacked from Liaodong, and on the other side, they secretly landed from Chengshan, occupying our Weihai. The navy retreated to a place with no defense. Commander Deng Shichang was defeated and died in battle, and Admiral Ding Ruchang committed suicide by poisoning himself. As a result, our northeastern barrier was completely lost. Weihaiwei Bay almost became Japanese territory. The Qing court endured humiliation and made peace, ceding Taiwan and demanding Weihai back. In less than three years, the British forcibly leased it as a base for their navy in China. Counting from the 24th year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty to the return in the 19th year of the Republic of China, Weihaiwei was a foreign land for a total of thirty-two years. I was ordered by the central government to guard this country. Tracing back from the early Ming Dynasty to the present, Weihai has had a dedicated city and official for six hundred years, and Huan Cui Lou, which stands high on the mountain, has been a scenic spot in Weihaiwei for almost five hundred years. Now, it is dilapidated and unrepaired, and it is about to collapse. It seems like Bao Mingyuan's "Ode to the Wasteland City." Will it make the scenic spots of one side be buried in the wilderness? This is the misfortune of the building, and it is also the insensitivity of the guard of the territory. Therefore, in July of this year, I ordered materials and construction workers to be hired. The project was completed in three months. In the central hall of the building, Zhao Heling was originally enshrined. Now, wooden tablets of Ding Ruchang and Deng Shichang are added. The project is about to come to an end. It happened that thousands of overseas Chinese in Korea were brutally massacred. Those who escaped took boats back to Weihai. The whole country was grief-stricken, and the hatred of the enemy was the same. I have been in the navy for a long time and have recently received special orders. Looking up and down, I feel even more sad. Since the opening of the sea ban, the great powers have surrounded us, gradually invading along the river and the sea, and it is not only Weihai. Taking Weihai as an example, it was originally intended to defend against Japan, but it was occupied by Japan, and then it was leased by the British. Now, although it has been separated from other ethnic groups and recovered its homeland, looking east to Lushun and the Korean Peninsula, I am saddened by the events of the Sino-Japanese War. The spirits of our naval martyrs in heaven are still difficult to rest in peace. Now, we have repaired it and added Ding and Deng to show our praise of the past and worship of the loyal and martyrs. Those who come later should also be responsible for defending against pirates and avenging the national humiliation. The sea and sky are boundless, and I look at it. If you say that you love the beauty of the forests and mountains and only use it for sightseeing, then how can it be my intention to repair this building? This is the record.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Beard Competition <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>I recently heard from a friend that "Masami Yamaguchi, the owner of the Fujiya Hotel in Hakone, Japan, has initiated an international beard competition to be held in Hakone, Japan. The motive is that Mr. Yamaguchi sent a photo of Nagaoka Gaishi published in a Japanese newspaper to Mr. Riverlief in the United States. He also asked Mr. Li to introduce it to the world's long-bearded people. After Mr. Li's introduction, people around the world who are proud of their beautiful beards are vying to compete with Nagaoka. So there was an international beard competition. Former German Emperor Wilhelm II and current German President Hindenburg are said to have joined the competition."</p>
<h3 id="e175">A Trip to the Temple of Li Bai <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>In the sweltering summer, I went with my friend Sun Fangzhai to visit the Temple of Li Bai and returned. Therefore, this record is made and also tells those who have a penchant for landscapes.</p>
<p>Scholar Li Qinglian of the Tang Dynasty was drunk and jumped into the river to catch the moon while visiting Caishi at night and never returned. Later, it was said that he rode a whale to heaven. Although it is a myth, the relics still remain in the human world. Caishi belongs to Dangtu County, Taiping Prefecture, Anhui Province. It faces the Yangtze River and has a rocky head protruding from the river surface, which is quite dangerous and was also a place that ancient strategists had to contend for. There is Mount Cuiluo on the reef, with many scenic spots, such as the Ranxi Pavilion, where Wen Jiao of the Jin Dynasty burned rhinoceros horns. There are still the Eyebrow Pavilion, the Sanqing Temple, the Sanguan Cave, and the special temples of Peng, Yang, and Li, three famous ministers of the Qing Restoration. The most famous is the Temple of Li Bai. The temple has been built for a long time and was rebuilt during the Chenghua period of the Ming Dynasty. Later, it was renovated with the special temples of Peng and Yang, with the beauty of painted beams and carved pillars. The main hall enshrines the seated statue of Li Bai. The statue looks pure and strange, with long whiskers fluttering. He wears a green robe and a blue towel. In front of him is the Zhexian Tower, which was inscribed by former President Tan and is engraved with a reclining statue of Li Bai, with a glass in his hand, with the idea of raising a glass to invite the bright moon. Two children are serving by his side, one holding a sword and the other holding a pot, which is natural. It is said that this statue was made by a famous master, so it can look lifelike. Peng Xueqin of the Qing Dynasty had a couplet that said, "Don't write poems here. Who can be the enemy of a scholar?" "I often catch the moon in the river. I am willing to worship the wine fairy." Every time I visit a scenic spot, ordinary people always use vulgar pens to scribble, which spoils the scenery. Therefore, there is a vulgar saying that farting on a high wall is ridiculed. However, the pink walls in the Temple of Li Bai are as new, and there is no vulgar pen to stain them. Is it because I am showing off my slight skills and dare not write poems? It is strange. At the foot of Mount Cuiluo is the Qinglian Cemetery, which was established during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. It is now a school playground and is trampled on by people, which is only used for nostalgia. Caishi is ninety miles away from the capital by water. Small boats can reach it in all seasons, which is very convenient for tourists.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Talking About Police Dogs <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>In the police stations of European countries, there are often trained dogs used to help the police investigate criminals and find murder weapons. For decades, the results have been excellent.</p>
<p>▲ One Policeman and One Dog: For example, in a murder case, the first step in the investigation is to find the murder weapon. At the same time, the murderer often anticipates this and will try to destroy the murder weapon or carry it to a distant place after the murder. The search for the murder weapon is therefore greatly difficult. However, if you have a skilled police dog, it will smell the scent and follow the trail. Soon after, it can be found without error. The great use of police dogs can be seen from this. Also, when a police officer walks alone on patrol at night or stands guard alone, a police dog is especially indispensable. Dogs are brave and loyal. If they encounter a strong thief, they will not be afraid even if they are faced with a pistol. Having a dog is like having three or four companions. Recently, many police dog experts in England held a meeting at "Crystal Palace" and decided to propose to the government that they should vigorously promote police dogs, so that every police officer in the country has a police dog.</p>
<p>▲ Special Good Dogs: However, the so-called police dogs must undergo long-term rigorous training before they can be put into practical use. And not just any ordinary dog can be used as a police dog. The current European countries use a special good product called "Alsatian." It is said to be the best kind. The temperament and physique of Alsatian police dogs are indeed more brave and strong than other dogs, and they also have the habit of only following one person and not eating if they are not fed by the owner. It is more suitable for the qualifications of police dogs. As long as you have lived with it for a long time, it will only recognize you in its mind and will follow you for life and will not go elsewhere. As long as you have regular daily feeding, it will not eat anything given to it by others. Police dogs, like police officers, will inevitably have many enemies over time. With this habit, you can absolutely avoid others poisoning it. And it has a very strong memory. Even if you take it to another place by train, it can find its way back home without getting lost. In addition to the Alsatian, there is another kind called "Great Dane," which is also very qualified to be a police dog. "Great Dane" was discovered by the British dog breeding expert Stewart and has recently been engaged in breeding. It is expected that in the near future, there will be more police dogs in the world.</p>

<p>When Louis XVI of France was about to ascend the guillotine, he laughed wildly. When Jin Shengtan was about to be executed, he chanted his poems loudly. Why? Because after these few minutes, there would be no more opportunities to laugh and chant. It can also be used to spend this moment of ten thousand arrows piercing the heart.</p>
<p>Today's victims in various places may not all be drowned to death. They are weeping silently, crying and jumping, like prisoners awaiting execution. How miserable are they? Alas, natural and man-made disasters occur suddenly. When they happen to you, you can only persevere in the ambition and knowledge of "the more chaotic things are, the more calm you must be" to deal with them. Otherwise, you will be at a loss and the misery will be doubled.</p>
<p>People in disasters will not be able to get everything they need in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Because they feel deeply inadequate in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, they are not calm in dealing with things, which will damage their spirit, disrupt their thinking, and weaken their physical strength. Even if natural and man-made disasters are not enough to kill me, I will also fall into suicide. Taking floods as an example, victims have nothing to rely on in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. At this time, natural and man-made disasters such as lightning, storms, heavy rain, scorching sun, military mutinies, bandit robberies, and械斗 will come together. Rats and insects will bite and hurt. People are unfortunate enough to encounter this situation. Not only should they imitate Jin Shengtan and Louis XVI's wild chants and laughter at the time of disaster to relieve their own sorrow and stop the tears of others, but also calmly and bravely seek a way out. Clothing, food, and housing must also be considered according to one's ability. It is necessary to strive for more comfort and warmth than on a comfortable day. Otherwise, natural and man-made disasters can be escaped, but plagues and瘟神 will come. It's really inescapable. My saying this is not unreasonable. There is no end to the suffering. Disaster and disaster relief people, please pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Anecdotes About Kang Youwei <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Mei Su</p>
<p>I previously read an article by a gentleman in the Free Talk titled "Kang Youwei's Seal." I found it very interesting, so I remembered a small anecdote about Kang that my family member once mentioned. Therefore, I recorded it for the reader's amusement.</p>
<p>Decades ago, whenever people talked about Liang Weizhi of Guangdong, everyone knew that he was the wealthiest overseas Chinese in Kobe, Japan. The cost of marrying his daughter-in-law was no less than hundreds of thousands of gold. The former Japanese Emperor Taisho happened to be visiting Kobe at that time and heard that he was also a guest at the banquet. Kang was in exile in Japan at that time due to political affairs. On this day, he was also among the honored guests. After the banquet, it was customary to make a fuss in the bridal chamber. The guests all pushed Kang to come up with a question. Kang said that he was not good at this, but he heard that the bride had the reputation of a talented woman. Why not come up with a small trick to challenge her? Everyone said yes. Kang then asked for paper and pen and wrote the eight characters "司月二大旦午住了" (si yue er da dan wu zhu le). He asked the bride to add a stroke to each character and then recite it to the guests again. After a while, the characters had been added, and the bride's cheeks were flushed, and she refused to recite it. Everyone was surprised and asked for the paper to look at it. It turned out to be the eight characters "同用工夫早生佳子" (tong yong gong fu zao sheng jia zi), meaning "Work hard together and have good children early." Everyone laughed and stopped.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Travel Notes of India (85) <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the tenth day, I visited the monk Shenxin in a garden. Kapok flowers were in full bloom. This tree is only found in Guangdong and Guangxi. It is tall and has no branches or leaves. The flowers are red and large. There is also a tree similar to a weeping willow, with long branches and large leaves. This garden belongs to a wealthy family, and it is their duty to support monks. They have four meals a day, breaking the rule of not eating after noon. Moreover, Shenxin has traveled in Europe and America for a long time, and he is indeed a new monk, as Master Taixu said. However, I think this new monk is too studious, and his eyesight is very poor, but he still does not let go of his books all day long. He is currently reading Gandhi's autobiography. I have introduced the first volume of this biography. Now, I have glanced at the two thick volumes of the second volume. The thickness of the second volume is even greater than that of the first volume. I can't look at it in detail. I am not a worm in the book and do not want to see too many paintings. His autobiography repeatedly mentions the book Geta, a classic of Hinduism. It also mentions the experience of light diet and hygiene, which is roughly the same as the purpose of the coarse food and health method I wrote in previous years. However, there is no good way to deal with the conflict between the law of protecting cows by Indians and the killing of cows by Muslims. I think deeply about it, and there is no good way either. The issue of cows is indeed difficult to resolve. However, I think that the morality of Indians is commendable, and this is the point. I really believe that human nature is not as good as that of cows. It is difficult to say that human beings have conscience. The Indian people have conscience. Gandhi's autobiography concludes with God, which is beyond my knowledge. In short, Gandhi is the leader of the Brahmin sect, more than Tolstoy, who is the leader of the new Christian sect. In the evening, when the sun was setting, I followed the monk to the back garden, which is on the Ganges River. The monk's eyesight is very short, and his feet are not good. He went down to the river embankment, supporting my shoulder. The Indians were surprised to see a Chinese person supporting an Indian monk. I came to worship the Buddha without a Buddha. The Indian monk is the representative of the Buddha. I am very happy to worship him. I cannot believe that God is real. I also do not believe that God helps good people, but I am close to people of all religions and follow their habits. I do not believe in any kind of religion, but I believe that he is a human being. Therefore, I also respect what he respects. Small boats travel back and forth in the river, and many middle-aged and elderly women come to worship the Ganges water. When they see the monks, they all raise their hands to salute. Indian ships are similar to Chinese ships, but when I think of the dangers and thieves on ships in the Yangtze River and other places in Shanghai, I am frightened. There are too many thief boats in China. Only the boats in Guangdong are mainly run by women, and I feel quite safe. When I returned to the school, I saw groups of cows entering and leaving the school. All schools in India have cows. Cows are gods and public milk mothers. There are conscientious human beings in the world, only the Indian people. Indian culture is the culture of white cows. Therefore, it is appropriate for cows to enter and leave the university.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Financial Gold Price Slightly Downstream <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>▲Six Tael Spread: Yesterday, the 19th, the gold price continued its downward trend, fluctuating irregularly between 780 and 785 or 786 taels. The overall market had a difference of over six taels. The hesitant state made it difficult to predict. Eventually, it fell by three taels and some odd change. Various firms did not have wholesale transactions, and there were more sellers. It is expected that when the silver market rebounds, it will open lower. As for foreign exchange, the trend was towards loosening, with the asking price extended by half a point. It once broke through the 80 tael mark, but banks had a good appetite and the price rebounded, reaching 86 taels. The price weakened again at noon. The afternoon market was affected by the fact that it was Wednesday, and traditionally, there were fewer bills of exchange traded, so the selling pressure increased and the price declined further. It is said that large bars may have a slight upward trend.</p>
<p>▲Opening Lower in the Morning: From the opening of the October market in the morning, the price dropped by two and a half taels, to 782 taels. Large bars were offered at 16/10, and the silver price rose by 1/8 privately, surprisingly rising by 5/16. There were rumors that Germany would purchase silver bars to mint silver coins, so the silver price was expected to rise, and people's sentiment was bearish. However, firms such as Qian Chang Xiang, Yi Feng, Yong Tong, and Tai Chang bought in, pushing the price up to 83 taels and 8 qian. At this time, Yu Dada, Decheng, Yuan Xing, Yong Shunli, and Wanxing, among others, were selling. In addition, British gold banks initially entered at 62.5, then 68.75, causing a drop of more than four taels, eventually settling at 79 taels and 5 qian. Soon after, firms such as Fuyu, Yongheng, Tianfa, and Yong, among others, bought in, adding slightly more than one tael. When the British gold price was announced, it was listed at 81 taels, with the asking price extended by 0.125, the US gold price by 0.25, and the Japanese gold price falling by 0.0125, but there was no impact. Unfortunately, firms such as Daxing and Yong took the stage to sell, and the price immediately depreciated by more than one tael, to 79 taels and 6 qian. At 9:45, it rebounded, with HSBC absorbing September and October contracts and Mitsui absorbing November contracts, both at 62.5 to 68.75. Furthermore, Fuyu, Yongfeng, and Qian Chang Xiang chased purchases, jumping up by more than six taels in just over ten minutes, reaching 86 taels around 10 o'clock. Afterwards, the trend declined, as Yuanmao, Yongyuan, Yuanxing, Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, and Wupin, among others, all sold off. The British gold price could be settled at 62.5, while the gold price had a small range of four or five taels. From 10 o'clock to 11:30, there was a slight fluctuation of one or two taels. Later, due to the report of a large Indian exchange rate of two annas, it fell to 80 taels and 6 qian. Qian Chang Xiang and those who were hedging bought in, immediately pushing the price up by two or three taels. The closing price at noon was 83 taels and 5 qian, with the quoted price changed to 819 taels, calculating a premium of around 39 taels, then 33 taels, and a noon closing of 36 taels.</p>
<p>▲Strong Selling Pressure in the Afternoon: The afternoon market opened at 83 taels and 2 qian, then 3 taels. The Indian exchange rate increased slightly by one anna, then again by four taels, to 3 taels and 4 qian. After 2 o'clock, there seemed to be a weakening trend, so Zhifeng, Yongjin, Anshunli, Wanxing, among others, all sold to hedge Dalian bills. Therefore, at 3:00, it was 81 taels and 3 qian. Later, firms such as Tong Tai Chang and Qian Chang Xiang bought in, slightly raising the price by more than one tael, to 83 taels at 3:15. However, the Indian exchange rate varied in size, so there was no correlation. Afterwards, Wanxing, Shunli, Qian Chang Xiang, and retail investors sold off, causing the price to depreciate. At the closing price of 4:33, it was 81 taels and 1 qian, continuing the decline of 3 taels and 4 qian compared to the day before. After the market closed, trading continued around 81 taels. The maximum price for the entire day was 86 taels, and the minimum price was 79 taels and 5 qian, a difference of six and a half taels.</p>
<p>▲Spot Silver Weakens Again: The morning price for spot silver bullion was 3 taels and 3 qian, the noon closing was 3 taels and 5 qian, and the afternoon price was 4 taels, with a closing price of 0.08 taels. The quoted price calculated a premium of 36 to 38 taels, with a recorded price of 80 to 84 taels, and a water supplement of 10 to 78 taels. The spot silver bar market weakened again, with only an incremental increase of 7 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen, because the Tianjin gang suddenly sold a large batch, estimated to be bought by Yingfeng Heng, Dafeng Heng, and others, totaling more than 10,000 taels.</p>
<p>▲Low Trading Volume: The table trading firms of Qian Chang Xiang, Dada Cheng, Tong Tai Chang, Xinheng, Bingxing, and Fuyu were all buyers. However, major firms such as Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanmao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Futai Heng, Yu Da, Yuanxing Yong, Daxing Yong, Cuichang Yong, and a Mr. Wu, among others, all sold. Source Tai, Yifeng Yong, and Senchang Yong had irregular transactions. In the afternoon, Dada Cheng, Tong Tai Chang, and Yuanmao Yong, among others, all bought in, while Wanxing, Zhifeng Yong, Shunli, and Jinan, among others, all sold. Yuantai Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Source Tai, and Yifeng Yong bought and then sold. Bullion was traded in and out at times. The Dalian gang was still the main seller, totaling 2,500 bars, while the Guangdong gang had no change, totaling 1,000 bars.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Yarn and Cotton Market Slightly Weakened <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was slightly sluggish. Overseas cotton yarn conditions were uniformly trending downstream, causing people's sentiment to weaken. However, a certain merchant absorbed a huge amount this month, and the market atmosphere was not as panicked as the previous day. A certain major firm also slightly compensated, so the situation was relatively stable. Recently, the actual demand from customers was still not bad, and the northern gang's appetite was healthier, but the actions of other gangs were still limited. Judging from the overall situation of the yarn market, there was a lack of manipulative factors. However, the bulls had reached a stalemate and could only buy and take delivery. If spot sales could be maintained temporarily, there might be a period of consolidation.</p>
<p>▲Benchmark Downstream: Spot transactions were still good, but the market was still flat and fell by 0.02, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 qian. The transaction volume was 41,450 bales. Gengfeng sold 1,150 bales, Tianlong sold 1,850 bales, Hengde sold 1,400 bales, Lichang sold 1,050 bales, Yiyu sold 1,250 bales, and Dachang sold 1,050 bales, Xiesheng sold 900 bales. Ruida bought 3,200 bales, Xincheng bought 3,900 bales, and Dachang bought 900 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Benchmark Closing Price, Change, Balance; Benchmark Closing Price, Change, Balance</p>
<p>August: 157.2, down 0.12, 35,200; November: 152.6, down 0.08, 109,200</p>
<p>September: 154.1, down 0.09, 76,410; December: 153.3, down 0.02, 104,350</p>
<p>October: 152.9, down 0.10, 97,100; January: 153.5, up 0.06, 68,600</p>
<p>▲Good Yarn Sales: The sales of spot yarn were still good. The whole day's purchases by various gangs, including forward and spot, totaled 1,900 bales. Among the peer firms, 120 bales were purchased. The market was flat. Among the customer gangs, 165 bales were purchased by the mainland, 100 bales by Shantou, 110 bales by Hong Kong, 310 bales by Tianjin, 400 bales by Qingdao, 520 bales by Sichuan, 200 bales by Nanyang, and 160 bales by miscellaneous gangs.</p>

<p>The decline in the cotton market slightly eased, but the US cotton market conditions were extremely pessimistic, and spot prices had fallen below the previous low of 10 points, creating a new low. However, the local sentiment was not severely affected, because the water level in Hankou continued to rise, causing significant damage to the cotton fields, so there were quite a few who were bullish. The bulls tightened their grip, and the market stabilized. However, the prices of foreign cotton were very cheap, threatening to dominate the market. The future situation was still difficult to improve significantly.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Benchmark Listless: The Hankou benchmark market opened with US cotton still falling, and the market sentiment was listless. The prices fell across the board by 0.01 qian in the morning, and were flat in the afternoon. The transaction volume was 84,700 dan. Changfeng sold 5,800 dan, Jifeng sold 2,600 dan, Changhe sold 3,600 dan, Lichang sold 3,100 dan, Yicheng sold 3,100 dan, Ruida sold 2,800 dan, Tianlong sold 2,800 dan, and Heshen sold 2,000 dan.

<h3 id="e188">Grain and Rice: Lower River Rice Market Softens Further <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>▲Arrivals in South Market (Xiang Road) Still Numerous: Some lower river stocks, rural and urban store sales are listless due to the relatively cheaper new gate price. All think about cutting prices and choosing, so the thick Japonica rice market is less than three feet short. But near noon, transactions became slightly more frequent, and it would not be strange if the situation turned stable. Early and late rice stocks are slightly available. Ning sales are not vigorous, and this street's sales also pick fresh and exposed rice, resulting in the price being reduced by another two feet. Although it felt better later, the price was not easily raised, and the market shape is still firm internally and soft externally. Later arrivals are bound to be rare. Although there are not many reed foreign pointed rice stocks, sales are not smooth, causing the price to gradually weaken, and the price of dark rice follows suit, and white rice is in short supply.</p>
<p>▲New Gate: Yesterday, thick Japonica rice like Changxi from the lower river region, measured in piculs, was flatter and weaker than before, so customers took advantage of this opportunity to loosen up, and the situation was difficult to stabilize. Reed foreign pointed rice was affected by foreign rice and opened by reducing one foot. Shibu and Chonggu thin rice arrivals were from a dozen or so stores, transactions picked the best quality, and secondary color Xitang rice milled was quite sluggish, the price was weak by two feet. Glutinous rice, food stores demand routes are still high, and the situation is tight. Foreign rice arrivals are weak, and customer groups move slightly, but the stagnation of this street is temporarily fixed.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Small Sorted Rice Uniquely Shows Appreciation <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>▲This Street Handled More Than 2,000 Bags... Price Rose by 0.1 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw another turning point because the production area's selling price was still more than half a yuan different from the Shanghai market, and there were no replies to telegrams offering lower prices. This street's hoarding accounts were active again, and both the market and people's sentiment were trending upward. Small sorted rice was purchased by hoarding accounts, with over 2,000 bags transacted. The market price immediately rose by 0.1 yuan, the price was 13.77 to 13.775 yuan. There were not many other rice transactions, and the price did not rise, accounting for 224 bags of Annam Japonica, priced at 14.9 yuan, and 100 bags of Jiangxi Machine Yuan Rice, priced at 15.25 yuan. It is difficult for the foreign rice production price to align with the Shanghai market, but yesterday the Old Sassoon Foreign Firm offered 2,000 tons of small sorted rice, priced at 6 taels and 4 qian. Whether it can be transacted depends on the reply telegram in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Flour Prices Hovering, Weather <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market situation of each month generally showed a hovering trend. Initially, the foreign wheat quotations were still slightly different by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and the several discs in the morning were nearly a share smaller than the previous day. However, by the afternoon, it was reported that the Nanjing gang was absorbing a large ticket, in the amount of more than 200,000, and the market could not help but turn strong. However, the major factories were gradually selling out, reportedly throwing out around 300,000 bags. Based on this situation, the rise and fall in the future will depend on how actual sales go, and then determine the final result. As a result, this month remained unchanged, September and October were down by 0.025, November was unchanged, December was up 0.05, and January was up 0.025.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Wheat Market Slightly More Stable <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's forward wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market situation of each month showed a slight stabilizing trend. Although foreign wheat was reported to be slightly smaller, the various inland gangs, because Hankou has not yet receded from the major flood, causing a huge disaster, and the Tianjin-Pukou section was also flooded, and the Pinghan sections were also deeply affected, speculated that the source of wheat and wheat would inevitably be cut off, so buying sentiment rebounded and the market improved again. As a result, this month was 0.01 better than the previous day, September was 0.02 better, October was unchanged, November was 0.01 better, December was 0.01 better, and January was 0.03 better. The current wheat market is still in a fixed situation. Although arrivals are still not smooth, the factory's appetite is normal, and more than 2,700 bags of Nanjing, Yangzhou, Penglai, Pudong, Wusong, Shibu, Zhitang, Taicang and other wheat were purchased by Fuxin and Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Sugar Market: Unified Price and Market, Generally Stable <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>▲Transactions on the Market are Not Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegraphic news: Cuban current sugar price was slightly down by 0.03125 from the previous telegraphic news, and New York forward sugar for each month also fell by 0.02 to 0.04, except for September which had no rise or fall. Java current forward sugar also fell by 0.0125 each. The association's market allocation panel transactions were particularly few, but the market was quite firm. Dutch sugar, 24 grade coarse granular white old goods, 11 taels 5 qian to 6 qian, new goods 11 taels 7 qian, 20 grade medium coarse white 11 taels 1 qian, the trend is still strong. Taikoo Sugar B Mark 12 taels 1 qian 5 fen, CW Mark 12 taels, DY Mark 11 taels 9 qian 5 fen, AM Mark 11 taels 5 qian leaving the warehouse is very short, transactions are not many, and the market shape feels particularly delicate.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Zhabei Goods: Gold Mountain Branches Showed Mixed Results <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Due to the poor harvest of Guangdong's Gold Mountain branches this year, ordinary round branches of the first two or three discs had opened at 67 to 68 taels. Recently, arrivals have increased slightly, but the field sales have declined, so ordinary village round branches have loosened to 62 to 63 taels. However, there are few flat branches, which have seen an increase, opening at about 92 taels, and high village round branches at 86 taels. Because there are few high-grade goods, it is still difficult to loosen.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factory Prices Difficult to Sell <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port still lacked progress. Although overseas silk sales have gradually started, the low prices of Japanese silk made it difficult for Shanghai factory prices to rise. Various manufacturers said that they were losing money at the lower prices, and transactions were quiet. Yesterday, only Lien Naba and others entered 20 bales of yellow factory silk, and Samsung and others entered 25 bales of coarse yellow silk, and the price remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Tea Market: Shortage of Goods, Prices Firm <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market of this port, there were no major transactions in red and green box teas from various routes. The existing stock of green tea such as Precious Eyebrow and major gangs on the current market is no more than 10,000 to 20,000 boxes. In reality, there is already a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Chinese tea merchants are not selling goods in their hands until the price rises. Therefore, yesterday's transactions in various teas were scarce, and tea prices remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Piece Goods: Winter Goods and Woolens Pour In, Over 6,000 Boxes <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The woolen goods and woolens sold in winter have gradually poured in recently. The goods shipped in April, May and June are all successively imported. Among them, those shipped by Italian, French, British and Japanese mail ships account for the most, with Qi Zhan in the east and west of the Huangpu River. Overcoats and velvets, as well as real and fake horse palm sleeves, melton, etc., are the most numerous. French shirts, fancy foreign cloths,</p>
<h3 id="e197">Hardware North Merchants Actively Purchasing Hardware <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been very slow recently, mainly because various regions have been affected by floods, resulting in little demand. Therefore, the overall market trend is quite quiet. However, merchants from the north, such as Harbin, Niuzhuang, and Yingkou, have recently boycotted Eastern goods, so they have come to Shanghai to purchase European and American goods. As a result, the business of merchants from other places in Shanghai is slightly more active than before. According to market reports yesterday, the goods sold included 650 boxes of tinplate, priced at sixteen taels and two mace and five candareens for 90 pounds of American goods, and seventeen taels and two mace and five candareens for 100 pounds; British goods were priced at fourteen taels and five mace for 90 pounds, and fifteen taels and five mace for 100 pounds; 740 bundles of black iron sheet, priced at eleven taels and two mace and five candareens; 200 barrels of French and Spanish nails, priced at eight taels and eight mace and five candareens; 190 bundles of American white iron, with prices remaining unchanged from before. There was also some demand for British steel plates, angle iron, new silver dollars, and fire-treated wire, but the quantities were quite small.</p>

<p>— Ai Qing</p>
<p>Impressions of Java, IV</p>
<p>Museums in semi-civilized nations are often overlooked by antique enthusiasts in civilized countries. After Java's subjugation, items rarely seen among the populace were moved by the Dutch government to the museum for display. Furthermore, historical and artistically valuable antiquities from various civilized nations are interspersed within, with various treasures and antiques categorized and placed in separate exhibit rooms for visitors to appreciate at will.</p>
<p>The most numerous exhibits are the treasures and exotic pearls of the Javanese royal palace, including the royal swords used by kings from five hundred years ago. Legend has it that the swords were for the exclusive use of the kings to pass down to their descendants. Others have myths about the pommels. The sword hilts, scabbards, and sword sheaths are all inlaid with hundreds of diamonds of various sizes, radiating brilliance and making it difficult to look at them for long. One ancient crown is about a foot tall and weighs seven pounds, cast from red gold and inlaid with gemstones and pearls. According to gem merchants, one crown in the museum is worth over a million Dutch guilders. In the queen's treasure chest, there are diamonds, agates, ambers, pearls, and various other jewels the size of wine cups, each with its own brilliant light, leaving visitors to exclaim in admiration. It is truly not an exaggeration to say that the Southern Seas are a land of pearls.</p>
<p>In another exhibition room, historical royal robes, imperial concubine clothing, court attire, iron armor, battle robes, spears, and other weapons made of wood and stone are displayed. There are also royal robes woven from bark and coconut leaves hundreds of years ago. These relics easily evoke memories of our nation's material culture from thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>The museum is about one-third full of coins, sculptures, weavings, porcelain, and pottery from various countries and eras. There are also Chinese coins and porcelain from the Han and Tang dynasties on display. Visitors to the museum can feast their eyes.</p>
<p>It is now said that the Dutch government plans to expand the museum and intends to invite archaeological experts to specialize in purchasing antiques and treasures from Europe, America, and various countries in the Far East to add to the museum's exhibits. Perhaps in the future, it will not fall behind the museums of civilized nations.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Recent Mussolini <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gao Zongyuan</p>
<p>Today's Mussolini and the Mussolini of the early Fascist era are almost like two different people.</p>
<p>The charm of the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may be more renowned in the world than that of even the most celebrated silver screen star in Hollywood. At the mention of Mussolini's name, the average person will envision a composite image of Napoleon, Caesar, and a hypnotist trying to lull a stubborn patient to sleep: a pair of eyes with a bronze-like gaze, a face with a haughty and angry expression, and an air of arrogance and boldness. These can be considered the prominent features of this image. However, no matter how accurately you depict Mussolini's appearance from a few years ago, today's Mussolini is vastly different from the Mussolini of the past. Frankly speaking, since assuming national power for eight or nine years, Mussolini has softened considerably. The sharp edges have long been gradually worn away by frequent diplomacy. His outlook on life differs from that of ordinary people; he views life from the perspective of someone who commands the masses. Consequently, his appearance has been affected, and his demeanor has gradually become milder. Now, his stature has also greatly increased.</p>
<p>His attainment of today's position is due to revolution. Eight years ago, he was a revolutionary leader, not only in fact but also in the organization of his mind, in his biased aversion to things at the time, and in his eagerness for reform, change, development, and improvement. Now, eight years have passed, fleetingly gone, and eight years of meritorious service have followed, leaving only their traces behind.</p>
<p>Mussolini's physiological characteristics have perhaps changed the least. He still has those slightly protruding, piercing eyes, his uneven gums, and his arrogant demeanor. I saw an old photograph of Mussolini a long time ago, a family portrait taken after his first child was born. I suppose it was eighteen or nineteen years ago. The photograph showed his wife sitting, holding a baby named Edda, and Mussolini standing behind her. At that time, he was just an obscure editor of a socialist newspaper called Avanti!, more familiar with the arduous life of literary work than with the position of a dictator.</p>
<p>However, his appearance, his protruding chin, his Napoleonic demeanor, and the expression he shows now when reviewing the Fascist militia or when receiving the cheers of the adoring masses are no different. His condescending and awe-inspiring air is clearly natural and not something he feigns. What has changed is not his eyes, but the light that emanates from them.</p>
<p>Many people who meet Mussolini for the first time are often surprised at how such a figure can be as courteous as an ordinary person. This is because the common perception of Mussolini as an arrogant figure is deeply ingrained in their minds. When they sense that he is full of all human kindness, that he can joke and make people happy, that he can sympathize with others, that he does not ruthlessly dismiss others' opinions, and that he is happy to seek their advice—in other words, that he is a reasonable person—they find it even stranger.</p>
<p>Anyone who comes to seek an audience and is led into his famous office, the Hall of Triumph, is mostly prepared to endure a severe ordeal, that is, to pass through that grand room under his tightly furrowed brow and piercing cold gaze. People have talked a lot about this chilling feeling, and many articles have been written about it. So, people had anticipated it beforehand. But now, the situation is the opposite of what it was before. In any case, the people who came to visit were generally greeted at the door by a short, stout man wearing an immaculate, spotless morning suit, striped trousers, and a flower carefully placed in his buttonhole. He graciously extended a hand. As he accompanied them through the room and invited them to sit down, he smiled sincerely. Initially, the visiting guests often couldn't believe that this affable host was the Mussolini they had long feared.</p>
<p>His conversations also do not proceed as people expect. He does not quietly sit behind his desk, constantly wearing the expression of a strict teacher scolding a naughty child, asking loud and sudden questions. He is very charming. He listens intently and constantly shows his intense interest in what the visitors have to say. He answers their questions very smartly and fluently.</p>
<p>A famous American painter who once sat for Mussolini praised him in my presence as one of the most courteous people he had ever met in his life.</p>
<p>Mussolini's transformation is most evident in his speeches. When he first took office, he was one of the most stubborn politicians in Europe and one of the most frequent speakers. He never missed an opportunity to speak. His speeches were generally known for their audacity and vehement language rather than for their profound meaning. His speeches could manage to hold the audience in breathless silence without using theory to convince them. He used threats more often than arguments. As time passed, his speeches gradually decreased. Now, his speeches are delivered after careful consideration, and their effect is based on principle rather than on flamboyant rhetoric. He has learned to speak only when there are important issues to address, and his speeches now receive the effect that they could not before.</p>
<p>Mussolini's style of speaking has not actually changed. His speeches often lack the elements that are most beloved by Italian speakers. He rarely uses beautiful phrases. He says what he wants to say in plain language that everyone can understand. He does not use convoluted sentences or difficult metaphors. As for body language, he uses even less. He does not wave his arms as ordinary Latin people are accustomed to doing, or rely on affectation to move people. He often uses his right hand to make a quick, vertical gesture to emphasize a point in his speech. It is extremely rare to see him pound the table to strengthen his argument. However, he generally achieves the effect he anticipates. He has a special attraction that can enchant his audience. He can make them ecstatic and enthusiastic to the extreme without using the flowery phrases or gorgeous metaphors that ordinary Italian speakers are accustomed to using.</p>
<p>When he speaks to the public in the open air, he exerts all his strength. His voice fills the largest space. He seems to have a full understanding of mass psychology. I have seen the vast open space in Bologna crowded with hundreds of thousands of people, and he has the ability to move them... He can make the audience enthusiastic to the point of intoxication, and he can make them as silent as the grave. A great man of an era who can control the emotions of the masses is truly amazing and truly admirable.</p>
<p>Mussolini is now very unlikely to speak in the open air. He often speaks to the Fascist militia or at meetings of key figures in the Fascist provincial party or in front of delegations of industry and commerce representatives, but these are almost all private gatherings in which ordinary people are not allowed to participate. He used to like to gather the masses under the window of his office, and he would shout to them from the balcony, where he almost lost his life when his predecessor, Senator Zaniboni, tried to shoot him from a nearby window with a rifle. He no longer does this. All his speeches of a political nature are delivered in the Senate, in the Cabinet, or in the private room of the Fascist Grand Council. In recent years, his speeches have become more measured in tone and have completely lost their previously distinctive features. Not long ago, when he was speaking to the key figures of the Fascist provincial party, who represented the Italian Fascist Party Headquarters, about four thousand people in total, he would have seized this as a God-given opportunity to launch a fierce attack on his opponents. However, he confined himself to making a rigorous critique of the achievements of the Fascist Party over the past eight years.</p>
<p>From a newly published collection of his speeches from the entire year of 1928, it can be seen that he made about forty speeches that year. Only two of them were of a political nature, and both were about foreign politics. One was delivered in the Cabinet, and the other was delivered in the Parliament. The rest were short speeches—often only a few words—delivered at the opening of Parliament, at the laying of the foundation stone of public buildings, at receptions, or at several similar ceremonies.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Marshal Foch's War Memoirs (European War) <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The Battle of Montdidier, August 8th to 12th, 1918</p>
<p>At four o'clock in the morning on August 8, 1918, amidst the fog that continued to envelop the preparations of the previous night, our artillery began a fierce bombardment, destroying the enemy's gun emplacements. The infantry and tanks of the British Fourth Army advanced from the trenches forty-five minutes after the bombardment.</p>
<p>Caught completely off guard by the intensity and speed of our attack, the enemy forces collapsed in extreme disarray, abandoning countless supplies. Our army advanced more than six miles that day, opening up a twelve-mile front. Our army secured a firm foothold on the Montdidier plateau, capturing 13,000 prisoners and 300 cannons. Now was the time to advance victoriously. Colonel Tidek was therefore ordered to transmit the following military message to General Debeney on the morning of the 9th:</p>
<p>You are certainly aware that the French First Army should advance as quickly as possible to link up with the Third Army at Roye. Once the link is established, the second step can be carried out according to the evolution of the situation. Precisely because we cannot definitively decide what action to take today, everything must be adapted to circumstances. Absolutely no division or corps of troops is allowed to be transferred to the rear. Should a troop be unable to advance further, it can be deployed in the second line for support. The march must be swift, using all available forces in the rear to screen and press forward to the front lines until the planned objective is reached. Only after this step is completed can all losses be avoided in a few days.</p>
<p>Shortly after, I saw that General Debeney encountered difficulties when his right wing crossed the Avre River south of Montdidier, so I sent him another order:</p>
<p>Since General Debeney has determined that the linchpin of his march is on the far side of Montdidier, it is imperative not to overlook it. The wing advancing along the Roye road on the right bank of the Avre River is the point of contact with the British army (i.e., the stronger army). He must personally command there, and especially pay attention to the 31st Regiment actively advancing towards Roye, where his heroes will find their place.</p>
<p>On the 9th, the Franco-British Allied forces made further significant progress. Seeing that they were surrounded on both the north and south sides, the enemy forces withdrew from Montdidier the following evening.</p>
<p>On the 10th, the offensive continued. North of the Somme River, around Bray, and to the south, around Chaulnes and Roye, many positions were captured.</p>
<p>The French Third Army, in turn, received orders from Commander Foch to join the battle. Since August 5th, he had anticipated that this offensive by the Franco-British Allied forces would be very advantageous, so he ordered the Third Army to prepare to participate in the battle on the right wing of the First Army. The Third Army moved towards Lassigny.</p>
<p>The Allied Commander then sent the following military order to the commanders of each army on the 10th:</p>
<p>1. The British Fourth Army and the French First Army continue to advance eastward towards Hem. The British army aims to reach the Somme River below Hem in preparation for crossing the river, while continuing to cross the river from the Bray area to Péronne. The French army will cover the British advance, with the Jusca - Hem road as the target.</p>
<p>2. The French Third Army is now advancing towards Lassigny-Noyon, closely following the French First Army to clear out the remaining enemy forces in the Montdidier and Noyon areas.</p>
<p>3. Marshal Haig should quickly prepare the British Third Army to operate towards Bapaume and Péronne to shake the enemy's defensive line and seize the opportunity to advance.</p>
<p>Our army advanced smoothly on the left bank of the Somme River, moving very quickly. Inevitably, there would be a day of pause, whether due to being out of breath or encountering obstacles in the face of strong enemy defenses, as it was necessary to deploy military forces on the right bank of the Somme River and in the Attois area so that they could engage in battle when the opportunity arose. Therefore, the tenth day's military order included a third section:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 10th, I visited Marshal Haig to explain the meaning of expanding the British army's operations north of the Somme River and towards Arras. In this way, our army's achievements would not be sacrificed due to local battles, and continuous victories could confuse the enemy's plans and fundamentally shake the enemy's resistance by delivering new blows to the enemy's weak points. This was even more beneficial to the Allied forces. These military operations should be prepared immediately.</p>
<p>But now, after three days of continuous attacks, the Franco-British Allied forces suddenly encountered stubborn resistance. The enemy had now reached the old positions of 1914 and seemed determined to defend them.</p>
<p>On August 11, the left wing of the British Fourth Army and the French First Army could no longer advance, except for some progress between the Avre and Somme rivers. Although the right wings of the French Third and First Armies made great progress towards Lassigny, it was of no avail.</p>
<p>I strongly urged Marshal Haig to actively advance towards Bray. On the evening of the 11th, I personally visited him to ask him to fight with all his strength again. But the next day, in a letter I sent to the two British and French commanders-in-chief, I explained that new tactics must be adopted to achieve our army's objectives between the Somme and Oise rivers, namely, to repel the enemy at the Somme River and to capture all the bridges at and below Hem. The content of the letter is as follows:</p>
<p>If the enemy stubbornly resists, our army must not advance simultaneously along the entire front. This strategy would weaken our entire line. Our army should concentrate its forces on several key points and strike forcefully—in other words, those points which, once captured, would cause the enemy to collapse. It is also necessary to disrupt the enemy's lines of communication. These military operations must be arranged quickly, and the forces most suitable for attacking fortifications, such as tanks, artillery, and infantry, must be mobilized.</p>
<p>The steps of the operation are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The right wings of the French First Army and the British Fourth Army should join forces to attack as quickly as possible, with the aim of capturing the road network around Roye. The French Third Army should cover the south with the aim of clearing the Noyon area.</p>
<p>(B) Without delay, the center of the British Fourth Army should advance northwest from the vicinity of Leschelles, with the aim of capturing the Amiens-Cambrai road. At the very least, that road must be within range of field artillery fire. The left wing of the British Fourth Army should assist from the east.</p>
<p>To expand the scope of our army's offensive, I added the following point:</p>
<p>Expanding the attack to both wings—north of the Somme River and east of the Oise River—can increase the gains. The plan is as follows: (To be continued)</p>

<p>▲Ms. Qian Shuzhen, the daughter of the painter Qian Huafo, has set up a clinic at the intersection of Sanma Road and Yunnan Road, and the clinic business has been very prosperous. Last month, she was invited to Wuxi by a wealthy gentleman named Qin to assist in childbirth. She has now returned to Shanghai. Because the original clinic is insufficient, she has added a branch clinic at No. 778, Qingyuli, New Chongqing Road, and has hired several experienced female obstetricians to assist her.</p>
<p>▲The Shanghai New Hospital, opposite the Central Grand Theatre on Sixma Road, announces that because the hospital has been busy with clinic business due to the change of seasons between summer and autumn, it has specially hired Dr. Zhong Dingshen from Germany to preside over the clinic business. Dr. Zhong has extensive experience in medicine and is particularly cautious in clinical practice. During the Northern Expedition of the Party Army, he served as a military doctor in various armies and achieved considerable results. He is particularly proficient in the department of venereal diseases. In recent years, many people in Shanghai have been cured by him. He is now scheduled to see patients at the hospital every day from 2 pm to 6 pm. The consultation fee is only one yuan and twenty cents to show consideration for poor families.</p>
