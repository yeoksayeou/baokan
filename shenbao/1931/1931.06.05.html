<h3>Orders</h3>
<p>The National Government issued an order on the 4th, appointing Zhang Changxi as a technical officer in the Construction Division of the Army Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs. This is the order.</p>
<p>Domestic Urgent Telegrams</p>
<h3>Train Derailment on the Longhai Railway</h3>
<p>More Than Thirty Killed in the Tragedy</p>

More than thirty people were killed instantly, fifty-odd were injured, over ten severely injured, much damage done to the carriages and tracks, the engine exploded, and over a hundred track ties were shattered.

<h3>Sino-Russian Conference Continues</h3>
<p>The Eighth Plenary Session Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Considerable Progress in Extraconference Negotiations</p>
<p>The Sino-Russian Conference in Nanjing has been silent for a long time. Reliable sources say that considerable progress has been made in extraconference negotiations between China and Russia. Regarding the railway affairs issue, our side has a relatively reasonable solution, and it is believed that unexpected results will come from the formal conference soon. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing External Affairs Department received a telegram from the Moscow representative, stating that the Sino-Soviet conference was originally scheduled to continue on the 1st, but due to a request from the Soviet side to postpone the date, it was rescheduled to be held on the 4th. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>A telegram from Moscow, Harbin: The eighth Sino-Soviet conference was originally scheduled to be held on the 1st. On the evening of the 31st, Karakhan claimed to be ill and sent someone to see Mo, requesting a postponement to the 4th. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin Special Commissioner Wang Zensi and Tu Wei were waiting in Beiping for instructions from Vice Chairman Zhang before they could go to Russia. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin Jilin Border Affairs Office received a report from a certain consulate stationed in Russia, stating that the Russian side was mistreating overseas Chinese, forcing them to work and not allowing them to return to their country. A special telegram was sent to Mo Dehui to investigate and negotiate nearby. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Li Shaogeng, Chairman of the East China Railway Council in Beiping, told reporters that the Sino-Russian issue is being handled by Representative Mo in Moscow in strict accordance with government orders and national public opinion, fully emphasizing the national relations of both countries. As for the rumors that the East China Railway is valued at 150 million gold rubles, this is inaccurate. The Soviet side has not proposed a specific valuation. In recent years, the business of the East China Railway has not been as good as before due to the impact of parallel and transverse lines. The railway originally had 22,000 employees, but after recent layoffs, only over 10,000 remain. The East China Railway Council is the decision-making body, and I, as the acting chairman, handle all matters in accordance with legal procedures. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Future of the Guangdong Situation is Uncertain</h3>
<p>A certain letter from a certain Guangdong commissioner in Nanjing to a friend in Beijing: "At first, I thought there would be many solutions in Guangzhou, and I originally disregarded my position in Beijing. But after coming here, it was completely unexpected. They welcome Wang Jingwei but do not allow his troops to come. They unite with Zhang Fakui and Gui but do not allow their troops to enter the border. The Western Hills faction intends to implement a Monroe Doctrine, not allowing youth party members to participate in politics. Party departments at all levels exist in name only, and government orders all come from the old regime. Tang Shaochuan was excited for the first two days, but later became quite discouraged because nothing could be accomplished. The future for us is uncertain. We plan to return to Shanghai soon for a temporary stay, and will return to Beijing when our leave is over." (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

According to Gong, the Red bandits in Jiangxi have been repeatedly suppressed and are no longer organized. Their main force is completely concentrated in the Guangchang area, and Director He is currently deploying various armies. Once the arrangements are complete, they can be wiped out in one fell swoop. Gong himself will return to defense after completing his instructions in Beijing. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Li Shizeng Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>Talks About the Cultural Guidance Committee</p>
<p>Li Shizeng arrived in Beiping this afternoon. Zhou Zuomin and Secretary Li came with him. Zhang Qun, Hu Ruoyu, Zhang Xueming, Bao, and others all came to the station to welcome him. After getting off the train, Li went to Hu Ruoyu's house for a welcome dinner. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Li Shizeng told reporters in Beiping that the Central Government hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Guangdong issue and will never advocate the use of force to create opportunities for the Communist Party. Therefore, the various committees have asked Zhang Ji to go to Guangdong to mediate. However, the attitude of the Guangdong side seems to be very strong, and it is rumored that they will use force. I travel between Beijing and Beiping because my health is not good, and I cannot stay in the humid weather of the south for long. I am taking advantage of my free time to come to Beiping for a short stay and visit Commander Zhang. After the official procedures for the Cultural Committee's budget are completed, I will go to Beijing to prepare for its progress. The Beiping Cultural Guidance Committee originally planned to hold an inaugural meeting after the National Assembly closed and Chiang came to Beiping. Now, due to the current situation, important figures in the National Government do not have time to take care of it. Chiang does not have time to come north, and Zhang is ill, so progress has been slower. After the budget is completed by the Supreme Economic Design Committee, the official procedures will be completed. After Zhang recovers, preparations will be made for a meeting to officially establish the committee. The program for the Cultural Committee will be decided after Chiang comes to Beiping, which includes preserving existing historical sites, improving transportation, holding exhibitions, and attracting foreign tourists. Concrete plans will be decided after the official meeting. Hu Hanmin previously suffered from high blood pressure, but has now recovered. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Layout of Various Institutions in the Capital Administrative Region</h3>

<h3>The Rumor of a Silver Loan</h3>
<p>There is a widespread rumor among Westerners here in Nanjing that the silver loan will be changed to half gold and half silver to avoid losses due to future fluctuations in gold and silver prices. However, important officials of the Ministry of Finance deny this, saying that the task assigned to Pittman is limited to investigation and that there is absolutely no room for negotiating a loan. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Principles of Tariff Policy</h3>
<p>Drafted by the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to determine tariff policy, the Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Industry held a joint meeting to decide that the principles of policy should be drafted by the Ministry of Industry and then decided by a meeting of the various ministries. Generally, tariff policies in various countries are divided into two types: one is free trade, and the other is protectionism. Currently, only the United Kingdom adopts free trade, but it is not absolute. Protectionism is generally used. The Ministry of Industry is studying which policy should be adopted for China. The general opinion is that Chinese goods are currently in a weak position in the market, and emphasis should be placed on protectionism to gradually develop them. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chambers of Commerce in Various Counties and Cities in Hebei Request the Immediate Abolition of Production and Sales Taxes</h3>
<p>Eighty-eight organizations of chambers of commerce in various counties and cities in Hebei presented a petition to Vice Commander Zhang, requesting the immediate abolition of production and sales taxes. The document stated that replacing the Likin tax with three taxes is greatly contrary to the purpose of abolishing the Likin tax. Moreover, what is not a product, and what goods are not sold? The twelve categories listed encompass everything. Even petty traders carrying goods on their shoulders, running small businesses selling rice, salt, oil, firewood, and other daily necessities, cannot escape the production and sales tax. Such heavy taxation and indiscriminate levies are like adding fuel to the fire, a hundred times worse than the Likin tax. How can we, the remnant of the people, endure this? Therefore, the representatives, regardless of the long distance, humbly petition and order the strict abolition of the production and sales tax on goods that harm merchants and harm the people, in order to relieve the suffering of the 30 million merchants and people in Hebei.

(4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhuang Songfu said that the principles of water management should be to work simultaneously in the upper and lower reaches, combining storage and drainage. The ditch and canal system must be restored urgently. The main rivers in various places should be dredged by the government, and the branch rivers in various places can be dredged by nearby farmers in sections, following the ancient system of corvée labor and utilizing agricultural slack. Because water management is for the benefit of the people, it should be borne by the people. Labor is money. Instead of collecting money and hiring labor, it is better to collect labor.

<h3>World Miscellany</h3>
<p>The non-materialization of the silver conference has been repeatedly mentioned by reporters. Now, looking at the US President's telegram to Smoot, after informal discussions by various countries, it is generally considered that the time is not appropriate. Thus, the silver conference, which was hyped up for a while, has vanished without a trace of hope. However, when this proposal was put forward at the business conference, the representatives of various countries unanimously agreed. Afterwards, although the countries all stated that they were unwilling to be the initiators of convening this meeting, they have not changed their intention to support it. But now they are saying that the time is not right, which means there is no intention to support it. How often has their attitude changed? Although today's so-called international conferences invariably start cheerfully and end in failure, even if they are fortunately held successfully, the result is equal to zero. Therefore, the matter of the silver conference is not surprising.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius went to England to meet with the British Prime Minister. Since the beginning of this move, countries have been paying attention to it. According to reports, the issue of reparations is the most important matter in this meeting. However, at that time, the French newspaper attacked it, saying that Germany should not raise this issue at this time. Looking at the Reuters news now, it seems that this issue must be raised, so what will be the impact of its results on the relationship between Germany, Britain, and France, and whether there will be any changes in the future, it is worth the world's attention. Italian Prime Minister Grandi debated diplomatic events today and gave a very long speech, with quite a cooperative intention for the economic relationship with Soviet Russia, saying that Italy and Russia exchange goods and benefit each other. He also said that Russia has been defeated by facts, and all countries in the world are now actively trading with Soviet Russia, and Italy was the first to understand that he hoped that the agreement established in March this year could create a more complete economic situation for Italy. The relationship between Russia and Italy is like this, how will other countries behave? It is also worth noting.</p>

<p>Foreign Important News</p>
<p>International Silver Conference</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Indicate Non-Participation</p>
<p>Summoning is Now Hopeless</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 3rd A cable from the US President today to Senator Smoot, Chairman of the Finance Committee, stated that after informal discussions with various countries regarding the summoning of a silver conference, it was deemed that the timing was not yet appropriate. Several of these countries, whose participation would be necessary, have now declared their opposition to such a conference, etc. According to Senator Smoot, who is currently in Salt Lake City, his hometown, this cable effectively closes the door on the United States' participation in a silver conference. It is also believed that Britain is one of the countries mentioned in the cable as opposing the conference. Therefore, the last hope for an international silver conference has vanished like smoke. This cable was also specifically released after the close of the silver market and various securities and commodities markets to avoid market turmoil.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Salt Lake City, 3rd The President's cable today has sparked a debate here. At a luncheon for key figures in the mining exchange, Senator Smoot, after receiving the President's telegram, stated that the only effective way to restore silver prices is to establish a practical ratio between gold and silver. He rashly declared that Britain is unwilling to participate in an international silver conference. Senator King then stepped up to argue, guaranteeing that an international silver conference would be convened and that Britain would definitely participate, advocating for London to be the conference venue.</p>
<p>German Chancellor and Foreign Minister Depart for London</p>
<p>To Discuss Reparations Issues</p>
<p>Emergency Orders Signed Before Departure</p>
<p>Plans to Reduce Spending and Increase Taxes to Cover Deficits</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 3rd German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius departed for London last night, planning to discuss German financial and reparations issues with the British Prime Minister at his country estate at the end of the week. On the day of the Chancellor's departure for England, German industry representatives gathered in Düsseldorf to vehemently criticize the government's proposals to address the current situation. They argued that the Chancellor should break away from the Social Democratic Party and trust the National People's Party, stating that Germany should be exempt from all reparations for one year, except for payment in goods. Creditor nations should assist Germany in finding export markets to promote German goods.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 4th Hours before departing for England, German Chancellor Brüning and his cabinet finalized measures to at least temporarily alleviate Germany's difficult economic situation. President Hindenburg will decide whether to implement the emergency orders to raise necessary taxes. The current budget is approximately 60 million pounds short, in addition to the 40 million pounds short in federal and city budgets. The so-called emergency orders are currently being kept strictly secret, but it is rumored that the planned compensatory measures are roughly as follows: (1) Reducing national pensions and unemployment benefits to save 20 million pounds in social affairs expenditures. (2) Reducing official salaries and child allowances to save 20 million pounds. (3) Increasing income tax to generate 21 million pounds. (4) Doubling the sugar tax to generate 6 million pounds. (5) Levying a kerosene tax to generate 3.5 million pounds. (6) Saving 3 million pounds in unemployment tax. The remaining shortfall will be offset by cuts in federal and city budgets. It is widely believed that if the President approves these orders, it may lead to a serious political situation, as the Social Democratic Party strongly opposes this plan, and the national population is extremely unwilling to hear about it due to difficult living conditions.</p>
<p>Unexpected Foreign Minister Grandi's Important Diplomatic Speech</p>
<p>Supports Economic Treaty with Russia</p>
<p>Sympathetic to the German-Austrian Customs Union</p>
<p>Three-Nation Naval Agreement</p>
<p>Negotiation Doors Remain Open</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 2nd Foreign Minister Grandi delivered a lengthy speech today during a debate on diplomatic affairs, outlining the Fascist Party government's foreign policy and reforms to foreign embassies and consulates. He stated that the exchange of goods between Italy and Russia is mutually beneficial, and there is nothing special about the relationship between the two countries. The diplomatic relations between Italy and Russia are no different from those with other countries and are not affected by the fact that Italy and Russia have opposing social and political organizations. Russia, with its one-sixth of the world's land and approximately half of the European continent, cannot be ignored. Russia's representative attended the League of Nations committee studying Briand's European plan and did not create any difficulties during the discussions that could be opposed by certain countries. Russia seeks to purchase goods worth approximately 10 million pounds from foreign markets each year and demands the world to listen to its self-defined standards to solve international economic problems. The statements of Russian representative Litvinov at the recent Geneva conference, though originally opposed by countries invited to the Soviet Union to the conference, also paid attention to it, proving that those who did not immediately want to adopt the opportunity of international cooperation have now been defeated by facts as far as Russia is concerned. All countries in the world are now active and trading with Soviet Russia. Italy was the first to understand the true situation of all of Europe, including Soviet Russia, but the last to benefit. He hopes that the agreement established on March 27th can create a more fulfilling economic situation for Italy, reduce Italy's trade deficit, and expand Italian trade in the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea Russian markets. Foreign Minister Grandi continued to speak about naval issues, stating that the Senate wants to know why the naval agreement reached by Italy, France, and Britain in March, which everyone believed to be effectively completed and which all three related countries solemnly announced as completed, is still being discussed and remains unresolved, leading to criticism as an inappropriate naval agreement. British Foreign Secretary and Secretary of the Navy traveled to Paris and Rome to ask about the document that formed the basis of the Italy-France-Britain naval agreement. A telegram arrived from Paris on March 2nd, signed by British and French diplomatic authorities, stating that France fully accepted the basis of the agreement negotiated in Rome without reservation. This basis of the agreement was announced by the French Foreign Minister in the French Chamber of Deputies on March 3rd and by the British Foreign Secretary in the British House of Commons the following day. It was agreed to be published on March 11th. When the drafting committee for the final text of the naval agreement met in London on March 18th, he stated to the British government that the drafting committee could amend the wording it deemed necessary, but could not change the articles in the basis of the naval agreement previously negotiated in Rome with the British Foreign Secretary in terms of substance or meaning. The Italian government believes that this is very clear. The committee therefore had lengthy discussions, eventually exchanging diplomatic notes. The three governments each stated their views. The Italian and British governments have always believed that this agreement limits naval construction from the present until the end of December 1936, while the French government believes that this limitation only applies to warships completed before the end of December 1936. As for construction started during the effective period of this agreement but which will not be completed until 1937, 1938, or 1939, there is still freedom of action. This view obviously directly contradicts the wording and spirit of the naval agreement, which is to have a six-year naval construction truce between the two countries. If France and Italy retain their right to start building unlimited warships during the agreement period in preparation for using them after the agreement expires, then the result is to completely eliminate the spirit of the agreement. Although this agreement is a temporary measure, it can have the effect of reducing warships, but the sudden request from France will cause the annual construction of warships to exceed the number built in the past six years. How can the two countries preparing for the Disarmament Conference do this? On May 9th, British Secretary of the Navy Alexander said that Henderson and I returned from Paris believing that a complete agreement had been reached. This is undoubtedly true. The agreement I submitted to the House of Commons on March 5th, from my perspective, did not contain ambiguous language. We have made all possible concessions. The above is the statement of the British Secretary of the Navy. In practical terms, the basis of the naval agreement is clear and simple. According to the provisions of its second paragraph, France and Italy recognize the principles contained in Section 3 of the London Naval Treaty. In other words, Article 19 of the London Treaty, the last clause limiting the start of construction of warships that can only be completed after the treaty expires, is of course recognized by the signatory countries, and the Italy-France-Britain naval agreement inherently includes the London Treaty. Since last July, France and Italy have felt that reconciling differences is impossible and have sought a temporary solution, on the one hand, to prevent the two countries' navies from rushing into new construction before 1936, and on the other hand, not to prejudge the highest number of shipbuilding programs for both sides. If one party to the agreement takes advantage of loopholes while the other party makes all the sacrifices, then this faithful compromise will be a laughingstock. The naval issue has the appearance of extremely important political issues, which is truly unfortunate. On the day the agreement was reached, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini said that this agreement would have a beneficial impact, benefiting not only the signatory countries but also the relations between people all over the world. This year is the year for preparing for the Disarmament Conference, and this agreement is a pleasant prelude to this year. Italy dares not be the first to sacrifice for this great cause. Under these circumstances, I can confidently say that Fascist Italy has done its duty. The words of the Italian Prime Minister were such that he never foresaw the unexpected difficulties that would suddenly descend. If the goal of the Fascist Party government is to realize its moderate attitude, then it can only listen to what happens with chagrin. But Italy's policy has a higher purpose: the world needs peace and trust, especially Europe. The agreement between Italy, Britain, and France, with the aim of implementing naval limitations among the five major powers, can be a true great expression of international friendship. I do not want to hastily believe that this beneficial influence will ultimately be abandoned. The talks being conducted in Rome, Paris, and London have not yet broken down. Recently, British Henderson, French Briand, and I have discussed this entire issue, but there has been no significant progress. I sincerely hope that the French government, in its reply to Italy and Britain, can find a way to eliminate this difficulty. (The following is a National News Agency dispatch.) Continuing to mention the German-Austrian customs issue, Grandi said that Italy has no ill feelings towards either Germany or Austria. Not only does it have no ill feelings, but it also has friendly relations. Italy sincerely sympathizes with Germany's efforts to save itself and restore its former glory. He concluded by saying that Germany's silence in politics and self-sufficiency in economics are indispensable for the construction of European peace.</p>
<p>A Prelude to French-Russian Friendship</p>
<p>Conducting Trade Negotiations</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 4th All eyes are now focused on the French-Russian negotiations. The Soviet Russian delegation, led by Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Delaiveyski, will arrive in Paris tomorrow morning and begin negotiations on Saturday. According to well-informed sources, although these negotiations only aim to discuss temporary trade measures, they could open the way for the conclusion of a trade agreement, and in the future, may even lead to the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty as a supplement to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. However, this non-aggression treaty will of course not include France's allies and cannot guarantee the borders of Poland and Romania. Furthermore, Soviet Russia is unwilling to recognize the Hague Tribunal and the League of Nations as arbitration tribunals.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Recuperating in Xiehe Hospital</p>
<p>Suffering from Nothing Major</p>
<p>But Doctor's Orders are to Refuse All Visitors</p>
<p>Ping News Zhang Deputy Commander recently suffered from the flu and had a fever for several days. He entered Xiehe Hospital late at night on May 31st to recuperate. It is reported that he is not suffering from anything major, but because he cannot completely refuse important official documents and visitors for important official business in his daily life without being hospitalized, it is very inconvenient for treatment. Therefore, the doctors and others hope that he will be hospitalized to refuse visitors for quiet recuperation. It was also jointly discussed and decided by Wang Shuchang, Wan Fulin, Ji Yiqiao, Hu Ruoyu, Zhu Guangmu, and others to ask him to reduce his workload and rest in order to recover quickly. He himself also thought it was right and therefore carried out hospitalization to concentrate on recuperation. He is renting several rooms in the Xiehe Hospital building, with a Xiehe doctor in charge of diagnosis and treatment. German doctor Dipl. will also jointly diagnose and treat him. His two or three younger brothers and Hu Ruoyu, Zhu Guangmu, etc., will take turns being on duty in the hospital to take care of him. He will probably be discharged from the hospital within a few days. It is also reported that Zhang Deputy Commander's fever has slightly decreased after entering Xiehe Hospital for quiet recuperation. The temperature announced yesterday (1st) was 37.5 degrees, with a maximum of 37.8 degrees, and the pulse was 80. From now on, the condition of Zhang Deputy Commander will be reported daily by Xiehe Hospital in a list (June 2nd).</p>
<p>Northern Important Figures Arriving in Ping One After Another</p>
<p>All to Pay Respects to Zhang Deputy Commander</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence June 3rd is the date of Zhang Deputy Commander's birthday. Various military and political circles in the north prepared in advance to come to Ping to celebrate his birthday at that time. However, because Zhang sent a telegram to stop them, it did not happen. However, important military and political figures in the north are still arriving in Ping one after another to pay respects to Zhang. A special record of the whereabouts of various important figures is as follows:</p>
<p>Wan Fulin Wan Fulin, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, arrived in Ping on the evening of May 29th on the Ping-Ji Road special express train. The train stopped in Tianjin around 8:15 PM on the 29th for about ten minutes. Wang Shuchang, Gao Jiyi, Zhang Xueming, Hu Ruoyu, and others, more than ten people in total, all went to the station to welcome him. Wang Shuchang came to Ping with the train. After receiving the news, the Beijing transport and political authorities prepared to welcome him. In the afternoon at 9:00 PM, the Deputy Commander's Office sent the entire soldiers of the 3rd Company of the Pistol Battalion and the security team of the Public Security Bureau to guard the station. The band of the Garrison Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau also welcomed him at the station. Those who went to the station to welcome him included Yu Xuezhong, Shao Wenkai, Tang Guozhen, He Lizhong, Bao Yulin, Wan Guobin, and dozens of others. The train arrived at the station at 11:35 PM that night. Mr. Wan got out of the fifth first-class car after a while and shook hands with each of the welcomers as a courtesy and thanked them repeatedly. After leaving the station, he took a car to the Oriental Hotel. Yesterday, the 30th, he had already paid respects to Zhang Xueliang. According to Wan, he came to Ping from Liaoning at the invitation of Zhang Deputy Commander's telegram. Therefore, he came to take care of private matters and visit relatives and friends. Only a few people came with him. The Sino-Russian border is very peaceful now. The rumors that Russian troops are constantly invading are not accurate. The local area of Heilongjiang Province is stable. After the bandits were wiped out, they are no longer a problem. The financial situation of Heilongjiang Province can still be maintained at present.</p>
<p>Tang Yulin Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe, arrived in Ping by car from Rehe at 11:00 AM on May 30th and went to the new construction of the Hu Tong Yamen to pay respects to Zhang Xueliang at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Wang Jingguo and Li Shengda Wang Jingguo and Li Shengda, generals of the Jin Army, arrived in Ping on the Ping-Han special express train from Taiyuan at 12:40 PM on May 30th. After resting at the Chang'an Hotel, they went to the new construction of the Hu Tong to report and wait for an audience with Zhang Deputy Commander. According to Li, he has no task here. His troops are stationed in Pingding and Yangquan counties. The current situation in Jin Province is peaceful. Commander-in-Chief Chiang has telegraphed to allocate one million per month for military expenses. Mr. Feng (Yuxiang) is still in Jishan and has very little contact with the outside world. Wang said that his troops, since being reorganized after the relocation, are now stationed around Baotou and Suiyuan. The remaining soldiers are left in Suiyuan for reclamation and utilization of the Yellow River for irrigation. He is now working with Army Commander (Zuoyi) to open canals. The Suiyuan bandit troubles have now been largely suppressed. The relocation expenses of his troops can be received after he returns to Taiyuan.</p>
<p>He Fenglin and Rongzhen He Fenglin, Director of the Military Department of the Northern Border Defense Command, and Chief of Staff Rongzhen arrived in Ping by special train from Liaoning at 11:00 AM on May 31st. Wang Yizhe and Gao Jiyi also came with him. Hu Ruoyu also returned to Ping from Tianjin on the morning of the 31st in response to Zhang Deputy Commander's call. Zeng Guangzhang, Director of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau, and Han Linsheng, Supervisor of the Tianjin Customs, also came with him. Zhang Deputy Commander's younger brother Shunqing also arrived in Ping on the same train. Zhang Xueming, the Mayor of Tianjin, also came to Ping on the morning of the 31st.</p>
<p>Shang Zhen Shang Zhen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, arrived in Ping by special train from Taiyuan the day before yesterday. Due to a coal truck derailment at Songlin Store, he was delayed for four hours and arrived at 3:55 PM yesterday (1st). Hu Yiling, Chang Bingyi, and Lv Xian and many others all went to welcome him. After getting off the train, Shang went to his private residence on South Chang Street to rest and reported to Zhang Deputy Commander's office to wait for an audience. According to Shang, the current situation in Shanxi is very good. Before he was in Ping before, there were many rumors. After he returned to Shanxi and explained, the rumors gradually subsided. This time, he came to report on the current situation in Jin Province to the Deputy Commander and asked the Deputy Commander to rest assured. He plans to stay in Ping for a week. Whether to stay longer depends on the situation. He took a loan of one million from Ping before and converted it into three million Jin banknotes after arriving in Jin Province. He borrowed another ninety thousand banknotes from the Provincial Bank and issued a total of 3.9 million to the troops to pay the arrears from December last year to February this year. The Deputy Commander has already arranged 1.2 million for the military salary for May. The 4 million grain loan has been organized for repayment. Yesterday, the Provincial Government held a financial reorganization meeting once to discuss the reorganization of Jin banknotes. Each yuan is valued at four jiao. The reorganization period is three years, divided into seven phases for recovery. The first phase is borrowed by the Provincial Government for several million yuan. The second and third phases and later will be issued by the government. The public bonds have been submitted to the government for early issuance. The central government telegraphed to send them to Beijing for review, so Chen Guanyue was sent to Beijing for instructions. The Provincial Assembly passed the removal of fourteen county magistrates because they failed to maintain financial stability. In addition, the central government telegraphed to ask to organize administrative personnel training institutes and district chief training institutes, which were also passed by the Provincial Assembly and will be handled immediately. In addition to returning to Taiyuan, the Provincial Government held six regular meetings and two temporary meetings in total for 13 days. After the salary arrears were paid, two military closing meetings were held, and then Li Shengda and Wang Jingguo, the two division commanders, were sent to Ping to first pay respects to the Deputy Commander. Division Commander Yang Aiyuan and Army Commander Fu Yisheng were originally scheduled to come together, but it did not happen temporarily. Division Commander Yang will probably come to Ping after he returns to Jin to pay respects to the Deputy Commander. The military salary for May for the Northwest Army and Sun Dianying's troops has been sent by the Deputy Commander to count the names for issuance. Sun's illness is indeed not cured. He telegraphed to ask him to rest assured and not to believe the rumors. Sun's troops are still stationed around Jincheng and have no actions. As for Mr. Feng, he is in Quwo.</p>
<p>Shi Yousan Bi Guangyuan, Director of the 13th Route Army Headquarters Office in Ping, went to Shunde a few days ago to pay respects to Shi Yousan to discuss important business and returned to Ping at 12:00 AM on the 29th. According to him, Commander Shi's illness has gradually recovered. After he recovers, he will come to Ping to pay respects to Zhang Deputy Commander and report everything (June 2nd).</p>

<p>Guangdong to Issue 10 Million Military Supply Bonds</p>
<p>With National and Provincial Treasury Revenues as Collateral</p>
<p>The Use is Exclusively for Military Expenditure</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence The Guangdong Department of Finance has now been ordered to draft the issuance of the second military supply treasury bonds worth 10 million yuan. The proposal was submitted to the Provincial Affairs Conference and resolved to be issued from June 1st. The said treasury bonds are specifically for military expenditure, calculated with a weekly interest of one percent. After one year from the date of issuance (i.e., until June 2021 of the Republic of China), the principal and interest will be repaid in ten months on average. The order of repayment will be determined by drawing lots. The face value of the bonds is divided into four types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan. The 5 yuan bond is further divided into five denominations, with each denomination being 1 yuan. The bonds are unregistered and can be freely mortgaged and traded. It is also stipulated that those who pay within June of this year will be allowed to pay 40% of the central banknotes, those who pay within July will be allowed to pay 30% of the central banknotes, and those who pay within August will be allowed to pay 20%. Overdue payments will be collected entirely in cash. The guarantee for the repayment of principal and interest is the national treasury revenue and the provincial treasury revenue. After one year, the principal and interest to be repaid will be fully allocated from the national treasury tax revenue starting in May 2021 to March 2022 by the Financial Special Commissioner's Office, and 1.1 million yuan will be delivered to the Guangdong Central Bank for storage for expenditure. However, when the national tax revenue is insufficient, the Guangdong Department of Finance will borrow from the provincial treasury revenue (June 1st).</p>
<p>Hunan Provincial Government Urges Conclusion of the June 1st Massacre Case</p>
<p>The Incident of the Military Ship Shooting Hunanese on the 12th of the Republic</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence The Changsha June 1st Massacre case has not been concluded for eight years. Yesterday, the Provincial Government sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urging a speedy negotiation with the Japanese side for a resolution to comfort the people of Hunan. The text is as follows: Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Honored Sir, The case of the Japanese Fushimi military ship's officers leading troops ashore and shooting Changsha citizens on June 1st of the 12th year of the Republic of China, although repeatedly negotiated, has been ignored by the Japanese side, resulting in the case remaining unresolved for eight years. At that time, two people died, some people committed suicide out of extreme anger, more than ten people were injured, and countless people suffered from depression and illness. Who is truly responsible for this? Who caused it? It is not easy to move people with words, but they should reflect on themselves and feel apologetic. Although the days have passed, the national shame remains. Remembering the past makes the pain even more intense. Today's diplomacy is fully integrated into the central government. Fortunately, the wise are relied upon for negotiations. Please expedite the negotiation of the case to seek a solution, not only to meet the expectations of the people of Hunan but also to meet the expectations of the whole country. Sincerely awaiting good news, He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government (May 29th).</p>
<p>Yuezhou Customs Collection and Expenditure Officer Also Embezzles and Flees</p>
<p>All Funds Before May Have Not Been Handed Over</p>
<p>Another Case Following the Changsha Customs Embezzlement</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence After the embezzlement case of Yang Ren, the Director of the Changsha Customs Dike Project Donation, the accounting and responsible personnel of the customs successively left their posts, embezzling a large amount of money, which is currently being investigated separately. However, Mao Bailong, the collection and expenditure officer of Yuezhou Customs, also suddenly left his post without handing over the work. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Finance, the new supervisor Liu Pengnian also notified Mao Zhongcai to transfer the handover to clear the procedures. The original consultation is as follows: "For the consultation of matters, according to the report of Li Zhaoying, the outgoing director of the Yuezhou Customs Office, the report is for the matter of reporting and replying. In accordance with your order, the post of Director of the Yuezhou Customs Office has been assigned to Gong Yeqiang by this office. In addition to ordering Director Gong to go to receive the handover separately, the said officer is ordered to comply and hand over all tickets, books, accounts, and collected funds separately, and report the handover situation in detail for verification as necessary. In compliance with this order, on the 16th of this month, all fees collected from May 1st to 15th of this year, including wharf donations and project donations, except for the office expenses and allowances of the office, a total of 164 yuan, 5 jiao, and 3 fen in foreign currency, actually stored 3,536 yuan, 5 jiao, and 0 li in foreign currency, together with the bell mark tickets and documents, a clear list was made and handed over to Director Gong for acceptance clearly, and the document was submitted for your inspection and record. Furthermore, the fees collected by the office have always been managed by Mao Bailong, the collection and expenditure officer appointed by Supervisor Mao, and all monthly reporting procedures are also handled directly by him. The said collection and expenditure officer suddenly left his post on May 1st, and it has been reported to Supervisor Mao for verification. All funds collected before May 1st and various procedures should be asked to be reported to Supervisor Mao for handling the handover, and a joint statement, etc., accordingly consult your director to check and clear the tax funds and various procedures collected before May 1st at the office, and hope to see a reply. This consultation is for former Director Mao of Changyue Customs." (May 28th)</p>
<p>The Rampant Behavior of Japanese Military Officers Stationed in Tianjin</p>
<p>Injuring People, Beating Police, and Insulting Our Country's Government Offices</p>
<p>The People of Tianjin Have Telegraphed Beijing to Request Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>The people's organizations in Tianjin stated that Japanese military officers stationed in Tianjin injured our citizens, beat Chinese police, and insulted Chinese government offices on the 2nd of this month. Their barbaric attitude is extremely hateful. They telegraphed Beijing today (3rd) to describe the barbaric situation of the Japanese military and requested serious negotiations from the central government. The telegram briefly stated that at 11:20 AM on the 2nd of this month, near Haiguang Temple in the Sixth Precinct of the Second District of Tianjin (note: the Japanese barracks are located in Haiguang Temple, near where Japanese soldiers often practice. In times of emergency, live ammunition exercises are carried out in the vicinity, and the people of Tianjin gnash their teeth), a Japanese military officer riding a bicycle knocked down an elderly Chinese woman, causing serious injuries. When the police officer on duty went to inquire, the Japanese officer was unusually barbaric and beat the Chinese police officer, injuring him, and fled by car. While the detectives of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau were investigating, a report was received from the police station in the Second District stating that several Japanese military police suddenly came to the station and demanded that the beaten police officer on duty be brought back for punishment, making a huge noise. The Public Security Bureau sent Section Chief Shen Dijia to inspect the scene with the Deputy Consul of Japan stationed in Tianjin, where they saw two Japanese military police in uniform and three in plain clothes occupying the police station in the Second District. When Shen and others went to inquire, the military police claimed that they came to discuss a local peaceful resolution to avoid escalation. Shen and others believed that the terms used before and after were clearly cunning and had other hidden intentions. Furthermore, because international negotiations could not be privately contacted by any military police, after consulting with Consul Goto, Section Chief Shen ordered the Japanese military police to withdraw first and wait for a formal resolution. The people of Tianjin were extremely angry because Japanese military officers injured people, beat police, and insulted Chinese government offices. Therefore, they telegraphed the whole country to announce the brutal behavior of the Japanese military stationed in China and requested serious negotiations from the central government.</p>
<p>After the Ancient Relics of Weixian County Were Detained in Qingdao</p>
<p>The Japanese Are Very Anxious to Retrieve Them</p>
<p>The Department of Education Telegraphed the Ministry for Instructions</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence The Qin bricks and Han tiles from the collection of the Gao family in Weixian County are extremely valuable ancient relics. Last month, they were purchased by the Japanese and transported to Qingdao in an attempt to smuggle them east. Fortunately, they were discovered by the Railway Bureau and detained. Recently, Education Director He Siyuan stated that although the ancient relics have been detained, the central government has not yet promulgated the Law on the Preservation of Ancient Relics, and it is not appropriate to confiscate them rashly. Since the detention, the Japanese have sent personnel to retrieve them every day, which is very urgent. The Department of Education did not dare to act without authorization and telegraphed the Ministry for instructions a few days ago, but it is not yet known whether it can prevent the ancient relics from being smuggled overseas. The text of the telegram is as follows: "The Honorable Education Department of Nanjing, I have been honored by your attention. According to Department Member Wu Jingshou, who returned to Jin from Qingdao, the Qin and Han bricks and tiles detained by the Railway Bureau are in fact ancient relics. According to the Qing Municipal Government and the Railway Bureau's consultations, because the Law on the Preservation of Ancient Relics has not yet been officially promulgated and implemented, it is not appropriate to confiscate them rashly, etc. It has been verified by all parties that the above-mentioned ancient relics are indeed treasures from the collection of the Gao family in Weixian County. Now the Japanese are holding the shipping documents and rushing to the Railway Bureau to collect them. The matter is urgent. Please instruct the Ministry on how to handle it, as I will follow the instructions. Signed, He Siyuan, Director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Education" (June 1st).</p>
<p>The National Lawyers Association Decides on Important Proposals</p>

<p>Local News: Wu Tiecheng Went to the Capital Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to Discussions with the Central Government on Important Matters</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang is Suffering from Enteric Fever</p>
<p>Zhang Ji Will Return to Shanghai in a Few Days</p>
<p>Central Committee member Mr. Wu Tiecheng was ordered to come to Shanghai to mediate the Guangdong affairs. Yesterday, due to important matters requiring discussion with the central government, he took the night express train at 11:45 last night to go to the capital. Our reporter went to visit him and, according to Mr. Wu, his trip to the capital was due to important matters requiring discussion with the central government, and he would return to Shanghai in a few days. The reporter then asked if he would be going to Guangdong, and he replied that he would not go for the time being. He also said that he had received a telegram from Mayor Hu Ruoyu from Peiping (now Beijing) today (i.e., yesterday) saying that the Deputy Commander was suffering from enteric fever and that the treatment was progressing well, and it was not typhoid fever. All the rumors outside were absolutely unbelievable. The reporter also asked how Mr. Zhang Puquan's negotiations in Guangdong were progressing and when he would return to Shanghai. He replied that Mr. Zhang had been sending telegrams every day reporting on the situation, and the Guangdong affair was generally peaceful and there was no cause for despair. Mr. Zhang was scheduled to leave Guangdong in two or three days and return to Shanghai. The reporter also asked when the Fifth Plenary Session would be held, and Wu replied that the Fifth Plenary Session would indeed be convened, but the date had not been determined. According to railway bureau sources, Mr. Wu would return to Shanghai tonight, and Wu also plans to publish his views on the Guangdong affair, but the draft has not yet been completed and should be completed in a few days and submitted to various newspapers for publication.</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui's Departure for Abroad</p>
<p>He Will Board the Ship at 2 PM Tomorrow</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Chonghui, President of the Central Judicial Yuan, is preparing to go abroad to attend the International Court of Justice in The Hague. His passport and other formalities have been completed. Yesterday, he entrusted the local Thomas Cook &amp; Son to purchase a first-class cabin, Cabin A, on the upper deck of the Tianjin Maru of the Dalian Steamship Company, scheduled to board the ship at 2 PM tomorrow (the 6th) at the Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu. Dr. Wang will first go to Dalian and will not delay before transferring to the Siberian Railway to Europe, directly to The Hague.</p>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee Pays Attention to the Plunge in Public Bonds</p>
<p>Submits a Request to the Central Government to Strictly Prohibit Current Officials from Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Executive Committee telegraphed the central government, submitting a request to enact two measures to strictly punish current officials for engaging in speculative activities and to effectively prohibit short selling and buying on margin in order to maintain the people's livelihood. It stated that after the Guangdong-Guangxi incident, rumors arose and people were panicked. Public bond prices fluctuated sharply, which greatly affected the national economy. In fact, the principal and interest of various public bonds have never been in arrears, and the management of the fund is even more solid and trustworthy. However, during this period of rise and fall, it is all speculative merchants who use their short selling and buying on margin methods to make profits. As competition intensifies, the rise and fall become more severe. It is reported that the current Director of the Central Mint, Dun Biao (a Guangdong native), is selling public bonds on a large scale, amounting to as much as 30 million yuan, causing the market value to plummet even further. When the people see current officials selling public bonds, they are all alarmed and rush to sell. Last week, some public bonds fell by more than ten yuan. The reason for this is entirely because current officials disregard the overall situation and disrupt financial and governmental credibility, which is not just for profit but a counter-revolutionary act serving the Guangdong side. The facts are clear. If they are not punished according to law to warn others, then imitators will follow one after another, and the harm will be beyond expectation. The Association feels the danger and dares not remain silent, and therefore proposes the following measures: (1) Issue a general order strictly prohibiting current administrative personnel from engaging in speculative activities, especially strictly punishing the selling of public bonds, and ordering responsible personnel of various courts, departments, committees, provinces, and cities to strictly investigate and punish those who sell public bonds according to the Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. Responsible personnel who know the situation and do not report it will be held jointly liable. (2) The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry should quickly send personnel to the securities exchanges in various places together with the local social bureaus to conduct strict supervision. If the people indiscriminately sell public bonds, they should be punished for disrupting financial order, and the competent ministries should formulate supervisory regulations to be observed. It is appropriate to submit a document detailing the above two measures and ask the council to review and instruct accordingly. Respectfully presented to the Central Executive Committee.</p>
<p>International Silver Conference</p>
<p>President Hoover's Telegram</p>
<p>Mr. Pittman's Statement</p>
<p>Whether the future of the International Silver Conference is optimistic or pessimistic is still uncertain, according to observations from various quarters. U.S. Senator Pittman, who returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning, told our reporter that he still believed that the International Silver Conference was necessary. However, Sir Arthur Salter, Director of the Economic and Financial Section of the League of Nations, said in New York the other day that the International Silver Conference would not help the silver market, indirectly representing the United Kingdom's opposition to the conference. The United Press International Washington reported yesterday that President Hoover had telegraphed Senator Smoot, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, saying that after informal discussions between countries, it was believed that the time was not right to convene an International Silver Conference, and that the participation of certain countries was not small, but they had now declared their opposition to the International Silver Conference. Our reporter asked Mr. Pittman about this telegram yesterday. He pondered for a while and replied that he did not know which countries President Hoover was referring to, but the opposition of two countries out of more than 50 countries in the world would not prevent 40 or 50 countries from convening the conference. The United States Senate was the first to agree that the International Silver Conference was necessary, followed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and finally the International Chamber of Commerce. Recently, after arriving in Shanghai, he received a telegram from the U.S. Undersecretary of State saying that the U.S. was prepared to participate in the Silver Conference convened by the countries. Mr. Pittman continued that he still believed that the International Silver Conference was possible because one country would initiate it, and 40 or 50 countries would follow suit, and even if one or two countries hesitated, they would eventually comply. The U.S. Senate, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the International Chamber of Commerce all believe that the International Silver Conference must be convened, but how to discuss it still depends on the conference itself. The reporter then asked which country was most qualified to initiate the conference, and Mr. Pittman replied that silver was a commodity in the U.S. and the U.K., but it was currency in China, and the U.K. was the world's largest seller of silver. The reporter finally asked if China could convene the International Silver Conference, and Mr. Pittman replied that any country could be the initiator. The reporter then met U.S. Senator Oddie, who said that he would stay here for a slightly longer time. The U.S. delegation was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 18th, staying for about a month.</p>
<p>Li Zhaohuan Hosts Banquet for Bu Fangji and Oddie</p>
<p>Each Gave Important Speeches</p>
<p>Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, hosted a banquet at the Bankers' Association last night for Bu Fangji, President of St. John's University, and U.S. Senator Oddie. Also present were Li Denghui, President of Fudan University, Cao Yunxiang, former President of Tsinghua School, Hu Shuhua, President of Tongji University, Liu Zhanen, President of Soochow University, Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, Cen Dechang, Counselor of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Shen Siliang, Vice President of St. John's University, and deans and professors from Jiaotong University and St. John's University, totaling several dozen people. At the end of the banquet, President Li delivered a welcome speech, and President Bu, Senator Oddie, and President Li gave speeches.</p>
<p>President Li's Welcome Speech</p>
<p>President Li's welcome speech briefly stated that tonight, educators were gathered together, one to bid farewell to President Bu, who was taking a leave of absence to return to his country, and the other to welcome Senator Oddie to China. The contributions of both were international. No country can prosper in isolation from the prosperity of the world, and the prosperity of the world cannot be achieved without international cooperation. We, as educators, have a heavy responsibility to pursue the truth and promote international understanding and goodwill. Can those who have already carried out this kind of work not be praised by us? In the minds of the Chinese people, education is the way, and benevolence and righteousness are the ultimate goal of the way. The ideal of benevolence and righteousness is universal love. This is why Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the former Premier of the Kuomintang, converted to Christianity and expounded the Three Principles of the People, and why our people believe in the Three Principles of the People and recognize the great personality of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The United States is China's best friend internationally. The only regret is the Chinese Exclusion Act. The solution to this problem also depends on education. May the guests tonight work hard to promote international education after returning to the United States. President Bu has been engaged in education in China for 45 years, and Senator Oddie has been a U.S. Senator for 15 years. It is a great honor to have them here. I raise a glass and wish them good health.</p>
<p>Senator Oddie's Speech</p>
<p>Senator Oddie's speech on road problems briefly stated that there is a new movement in the United States, namely the road movement. The U.S. government has established a road bureau in Washington, with road engineer MacDonald as the director, to handle federal government funding for roads in various states. Last year, an international road conference was held in the United States, and China also participated. The people of North and South America are now engaged in the Pan-American Highway, which runs from Alaska through British Columbia, Canada, the United States, Mexico, and directly to various countries in South America. After this road is completed, it will enable the people of the Americas to have a closer understanding and more friendly friendship. China now has this urgent need. MacDonald, Director of the Washington Road Bureau, is willing to come to China to study road development issues.</p>
<p>President Bu's Speech</p>
<p>President Bu's speech briefly stated that China is now experiencing a new cultural movement that is unparalleled in history. He is fortunate to have been able to witness its development and growth from the beginning. If China wants true democracy, then universal education is essential. In order for universal education to make university education not only a special benefit for the children of wealthy families but also an opportunity for ordinary people to receive university education, it is necessary to improve the economic situation. However, improving the economic situation and universal education are interrelated. In addition, as the historian H.G. Wells said, China needs a new, easy-to-learn alphabet. As for the education system, it is not necessary to copy foreign models. European and American education systems are not necessarily all suitable. The biggest problem in China's current education system is that middle schools are not doing well enough. China spends a lot of money on universities, and there are not a few university professors who are employed for life. There are good primary schools everywhere, but there are not many middle schools that can satisfy people. However, it is not known that middle schools cultivate capable people to enter universities on the one hand and train poor people to enter the world to make a living on the other hand, and their relationship is very important. China's education authorities adopt the centralized system of France in their education policy, while following the decentralized system of the United Kingdom and the United States. He is very skeptical of the results. Because China is vast and broad, it is not easy to take care of everything. Some people think that education is a means rather than an end, which is also dangerous. Finally, whether education becomes a moral force and whether the goal is to cultivate personality and character is a major issue today.</p>
<p>Kangzang Party Affairs Personnel</p>
<p>Ms. Liu Manqing and Others Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>

<p>A Large Amount of Drugs Was Seized on Two Foreign Ships</p>
<p>Worth About 250,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that customs officials seized a large amount of heroin on two ships from Europe last Saturday (the 30th). One was the Gemma of the Java Company. When it arrived at Wusongkou on Saturday morning, customs officials boarded the ship and searched it carefully, finding 391 pounds of pure heroin hidden among the bolts of cloth. Also that morning, the Durban Maru of the Postal Steamship Company docked at the Huishan Wharf. Customs officials boarded the ship and searched it, but found nothing at first. After a thorough search, they found 179 pounds of pure heroin hidden inside olive barrels. In total, 570 pounds were seized from the two ships, worth about 250,000 yuan at local retail prices. This is the second time this year that such a large amount of drugs has been seized. The Gemma came from Antwerp, Belgium, and unloaded chemicals at the North Bund Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company before a fire broke out. According to news received today (the 4th), the smuggler of these drugs was shipping them to Shanghai, but the consignee has not yet been identified. The ship sailed for Java this morning. The Durban Maru also came from Europe.</p>
<p>Taxpayer Association Sends Letter to U.S. Consul General</p>
<p>Requesting Prompt Resolution of Unfortunate Incidents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, which stated: We have repeatedly reported that the case of Gu Jingen, who was shot and killed by U.S. sailors, has not been resolved. In addition, Dai Tingzu was pushed into the Huangpu River and died at the Jinliyuan Wharf. Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang were stabbed at the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Gordon Road. Yang Jin'er, Sun Debao, Wang Jinfa, and Ma Lin were stabbed by U.S. merchant sailors at the Qichang Wharf. The above cases have all been reported in Shanghai newspapers, and we believe that the Consul General has also read them. Sino-U.S. relations have always been extremely cordial, but unfortunate incidents that harm Sino-U.S. relations have been repeatedly caused by U.S. soldiers and civilians, which is regrettable. We are sending this letter to request that the Consul General attach importance to Sino-U.S. relations and promptly resolve the above cases in a manner that is in accordance with international etiquette and guarantees that similar incidents will not occur again.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Negotiations on the Qu-Ma Case</p>
<p>The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association Actively Provides Assistance</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai reporting that Qu Heigou and Ma Ruixiang were stabbed by U.S. sailors on the 26th of this month. It requested unanimous support to achieve the goals of punishing the murderer, apologizing, and paying compensation, and demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in China and the implementation of the government's policy of abolishing unequal treaties. The letter was forwarded to the Municipal Government for serious negotiations. The original letter stated that in this case, the U.S. sailors suddenly became angry at the person who returned the dropped hat and the bystander who helped to dissuade them because of a dispute over the fare, causing two Chinese people to be seriously injured and one to be slightly injured, which was cruel and unreasonable. The Dai Tingzu case has not yet been resolved, and this tragic case has followed. It shows that foreigners rely on their concession and consular jurisdiction as a talisman, and the perpetrators can arbitrarily remain at large, resulting in a lack of scruples. The letter further stated that it is appropriate to present this matter to your government for review and approval, and to send a letter to the U.S. Consul to request that he punish the murderer, apologize, and provide appropriate compensation to appease the public anger. As for the recovery of the concession and jurisdiction, these two matters are the established policies of the Party's rule and should be addressed in a separate document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for prompt implementation so that the international disputes in this city can be fundamentally resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It has now been learned that the injuries of Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang, who were stabbed by U.S. sailors, are gradually improving. The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai has sent a telegram to the central government requesting serious negotiations and asking local groups to unite in support as a backing for the recovery of extraterritoriality. The Foreign Affairs Office replied that this case should be handled by the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the association immediately presented it to the Municipal Government, requesting that it preside over negotiations to achieve the goals of punishing the murderer, apologizing, and paying compensation, and to ensure that U.S. sailors do not act recklessly and endanger the safety of our Chinese people in the future. The Lawyers Association has also been introduced by the Standing Committee to Wu Jingxiong, a lawyer, to handle the negotiations in this case. The association's investigation of the location and circumstances of the incident is very detailed and can serve as strong evidence for the Qu case negotiations.</p>
<p>(1) The intersection of Edinburgh Road and Gordon Road is a cruciform shape that is extremely secluded and mostly composed of public residences. There are only a few shops on the corner, and it is especially quiet at night. The U.S. Army General Association's pub is located nearby at No. 43, about 280 or 290 steps away from Qu Shunji's tailor shop. There are many sailors coming and going day and night, and merchants are generally wary of the arrogance of U.S. sailors, often avoiding them, and there is a tendency to turn pale at the mere mention of them.</p>
<p>(2) When the Qu case occurred, Tan Fulin, a driver at the Yiyi Rubber Company, Wang Shuyou, a fellow at the Hongshengtai cigarette paper shop, Kang Bin, a fellow at the Tai cigarette paper shop, Hu Yaoyao, and Chen Yudi of Zhou Jingmei Watch and Clock Company were all witnesses at the scene and can provide corroboration.</p>
<p>(3) Fu Qu, a policeman from the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, Hai Gou, Liu Sanduo, Tan Fulin, and three waiters from the pub all gave statements on the evening of May 26. On the 27th, Qu Shixiang's wife, Qu Cao, Wang Shuyou, and Kang Bin's fellow gave statements to the police station.</p>
<p>(4) The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the four U.S. soldiers currently detained at the U.S. Headquarters on Haifang Road all stated that they were only watching idly at the scene and did not commit the crime, and denied carrying knives. The U.S. Marines and the police authorities have not found the knife used to commit the crime on the four U.S. soldiers or on any of the Chinese people at the scene. This kind of evasion is difficult to escape the facts. Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang were rescuing each other, and there is no way that they would stab themselves with a knife and blame the four U.S. soldiers who were witnessed committing the crime. As for the knife used to commit the crime, a certain waiter can prove that the U.S. headquarters escorted the U.S. soldiers who committed the crime to search for the knife in a certain place in the pub. The knife is black-handled and can be bent.</p>
<p>(5) The other party also claimed that Mrs. O'Reilly, an officer of the U.S. Army, testified that she saw two Chinese people fighting from the window of the bedroom at No. 101 Edinburgh Road, and did not see any U.S. soldiers joining in, and only heard one shout from a Westerner, which was to encourage the people who were fighting. She did not see anyone using a knife. However, No. 101 is 80 or 90 steps away from the scene of the incident, and it is impossible to see that far at night, which shows that her statement is completely for the sake of shielding.</p>
<p>(6) After the case occurred, the shops and residents near the area were willing to provide assistance in order to protect the Chinese people, and they will provide a map explaining the location of the incident.</p>

The candidate representative elected last time will fill the position of the delegation to Beijing. (2) Due to the frequent shootings of Chinese people by U.S. soldiers recently, the association's organization and titles should be changed. It was decided to make a decision after convening a meeting of representatives. (3) The case of scheduling a meeting of representatives was decided to convene next Monday (the 8th) at 2:00 PM.

<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Commends Private Acid Manufacturing Industry</p>
<p>Goods Can Be Shipped Before Double Tenth Festival</p>
<p>Since last year, Yu Heqin and others, in view of the fact that the three acids of sulfur, nitrate, and salt all depend on foreign goods, which makes it impossible for the domestic chemical industry to develop, applied to the two ministries of Industry and Commerce and the military government to establish the Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Plant. The operation, preparation, and progress have been very rapid. Last month, it was reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce planned to establish acid and salt factories in Shanghai and Tianjin. Mr. Yu went to Beijing again to apply to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which approved the private operation and temporarily allowed exclusive operation. The Ministry's approval stated that the principle of national operation of enterprises is always to benefit private enterprises. The representative is enthusiastic about establishing an acid manufacturing plant and his ambition is commendable. It is hoped that he will proceed diligently. It is recently learned that the company's shares have long been fully subscribed and the deadline for collecting shares is at the end of this month. The construction of the factory began last month, and various machines and materials have also been ordered from abroad. Goods can be shipped before Double Tenth Festival this year.</p>

<p>Municipal Party Department Takes Over Seamen's General Union</p>
<p>But No Results</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai National Seamen's Union was taken over by members sent by the Municipal Party Department. The staying committee members refused to hand over, and the inside story was quite complicated. The reporter went to various parties to investigate and found out the following:</p>
<p>Committee Members Depart Privately</p>
<p>The National Seamen's Industrial Federation is located on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai. Since being ordered to reorganize, it has been renamed the National Seamen's Reorganization Committee. It was originally planned to hold a national representative conference on April 1, but it was temporarily postponed due to the opening of the National Assembly and the order of the central government, and it was planned to reorganize after the National Assembly. However, on May 31, the reorganization committee members and instructors Zhao Zhenzhi, Huang Yushu, Liang Degong, Lin Yinsheng, and Secretary Liu Yuzhou either resigned, claimed illness, or went to Beijing, all of them leaving. When they left, they took away the association's seals and important documents. The association has a total of seven standing committee members, and five of them, including Zhao Zhizhi, are appointed by the Central Party Department.</p>
<p>Notify Sub-Branches to Take Over</p>
<p>When each committee member left the association, they used the name of the general union to issue a notice ordering the Shanghai Seamen's Branch to send personnel to take over. The original order stated: The Shanghai Branch Reorganization Committee believes that the association's organizational rules are invalid and has decided to temporarily close. The association should quickly send personnel and police to the association to count all public property and keep it safe temporarily. The branch received this order and immediately appointed Standing Committee Member He Zhenhuan to go to negotiate.</p>
<p>Three Committee Members Stay to Temporarily Defend</p>
<p>There are still three committee members in the general union: Miao Shuizhang, Qiu Yaokuan, and Mu Yeyi. They were unaware of the departure of Zhao, Huang, Liang, Lin, and others. It was not until June 1 that they learned that the association was temporarily maintained by the three committee members who remained stationed there. They reported to the Central Party Department and requested instructions, so the meeting on June 1 could not be held and all facts have been stopped. Miao, Qiu, and Mu have telegraphed the central government twice but have not received a reply. They inquired again yesterday.</p>
<p>Party Department Sends Personnel to Take Over</p>
<p>On June 1, the Shanghai Seamen's Branch was the first to send Standing Committee Member He Zhenhuan to the general union to participate in the celebration and announce the Constitutional Convention. When he arrived at the meeting, there was no one. It was not until he returned to the branch that he received the notice and immediately reported it to the local Municipal Party Department to request instructions. It was not until yesterday that he received an instruction from the Municipal Party Department ordering the branch committee members to go to the general union to take over the documents and other items in the association.</p>
<p>Three Committee Members Refuse to Hand Over</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department immediately appointed He Zhenhuan of the Seamen's Branch as the committee member to take over and count the Seamen's General Union, and Ma Zhongxian as the committee member to take over and keep the documents of the general union. When Mr. Ma and Mr. He went to the general union yesterday to take over, the three remaining committee members, Miao, Qiu, and Mu, said that the general union was directly under the central government and was not subject to the control of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department. According to the procedures, it was inconvenient to transfer the documents and items in the association. They had to follow the instructions of the central government before they could do so, so there were no results. Mr. Ma and Mr. He immediately reported this intention to the Municipal Party Department to relay to the Central Party Department to request instructions. The affairs of the association are now completely stalled and have been virtually dissolved.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Appeals for Heavy Business Tax</p>
<p>Ye Huijun and Others Telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government</p>
<p>To Chairman Ye and Director Chen of the Finance Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government: We have received letters from the Shanghai Grain and Bean Industry Association and the Suzhou Rice Industry Association stating that the regulations and detailed rules for the implementation of the business tax in Jiangsu Province have been amended by the Ministry of Finance. The provincial government is urgently seeking to make up for the losses after the tax reduction, so it plans to open the tax immediately without delay, and the county chamber of commerce has repeatedly urged various industries to recognize the package. However, our industry is completely engaged in selling and buying on behalf of customers, which is very different from the industry of self-selling. Since</p>
