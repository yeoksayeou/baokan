<h3>意外相之平等説</h3>
<p>意外相昨論外交政策之三大原則謂欲達此三原則非各邦完全居於均等地位不可故意國外交政策志在消滅戰勝國與戰敗國間之鴻溝今日羅馬電謂意國各報對此演説非常重視謂意國將於國際軍縮會議中主張絶對平等非此而欲望歐洲各國彼此和洽合作實不可能云云是誠主張和平者最扼要之言也然而欲實現此主張則又甚難蓋自歐戰後以迄近今德國之所以常憤憤不平者即藉口於戰勝國與戰敗國間之不平等也戰事旣己消滅自不應再留勝敗之芥蒂然而欲消滅此勝敗之芥蒂又非空言所能成功必須勝敗國間之權利義務均能眞實平等而後可則純爲事實問題矣故今日而欲實現絶對平等必須於事實上求之此我之所謂難也</p>
<p>且所謂國際平等云者非僅消滅戰勝國與戰敗國之鴻溝而己凡强大國與弱小國間之一切不平等觀念亦須隨以消滅始能達到目的方今世界不平等之事多矣弱小之國弱小之民族被壓迫而呼籲於國聯會議者亦日有所聞矣誠能本此勝敗間平等之一念推而至於其他世界上一切問題皆有以解除不平等之束縛毁棄種種不平等之條約方能實現眞實之平等不然者去和平之途徑猶遥遠也</p>

<p>男子把女子當作玩具這句話現在好像己經成爲時代的落伍者了而女子把男子當作消遺品的一句話倒好像有些時髦起來了這大概也是物極必反的一個例證吧總之無論男子把女子當作玩具也好女子把男子當作消遣品也好必定有一方面受着很大的害處這是千古不易的我自從在巴黎大戲院看了那「女性的消遣」影片試映後後遂又平空添增了無窮的感慨那本片子的劇情大約是説一個精悍的馬車夫因爲不幸做了一位女交際花的消遣品遂致發生種種慘劇愛兒因追呼父親而凍斃雪中嬌妻因痛恨交加而遁跡空門而彼時交際之花早己把他的影子都忘郤了這是多麽悽慘的事啊該片係歐歐出品完全有聲不但各種歌舞别具一格而表情的深刻更足刻刻震盪觀衆的心絃這確是近代影片中的佳品聽説巴黎己定於本星期三公映了</p>

<h3>列車次數改革後所聞</h3>
<p>淞滬路自改用蒸汽車以來每日上下行車有七十四次現路局將車班重行規定改爲每日四十次江灣至上海一段内則添開區間車四十二次一班乘客有因全路車次减去太多恐不敷用頗多疑慮惟據實地調查所得淞滬路在改用蒸汽車前每日上下行列車僅二十四次自蒸汽車班驟加至七十四次確係供過於求現在修訂時刻每日四十次雖减少三十四次仍較從前列車班數增加十六次至江灣上海一段則每日達八十二次另貨車六次較前更有增加聞路局此次改革係經詳細考慮依照乘客實在需要規定車次騰出多餘之蒸汽車預備</p>

<p>（十六）</p>

<p>婦女生活</p>
<h3>紐約職業婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>（二）前進的機會</p>
<p>美國的許多大實業差不多都集聚在紐約那里聞名全球的各大公司各種業務的辦公室都有紐約旣爲世界上最大的城市他那里的職業位置眞是應有盡有而且都是靠得住而有希望的所以在紐約有整千整萬的婦女賺着很豐满的薪金還有一事就是紐約商界中對於婦女們的待遇也很少差異</p>
<p>女子們在紐約如果他們的知識平庸而商業上的本領又無特長的那末不免要覺得困難這個奮發的大城他所需要的爲青年人及具有創作力者凡是女子們有一種理想而這種理想又能施諸事實者那末這個女子就很容易找她的出路縱使她不能得到满意的結果然而她的才能終究爲人所賞識的在另一方面講起來凡是做例行公事的女子譬如一個好的速記員一個能夠的書記或是一個可靠的簿記員她們如果跑到紐約來結果必使她們灰心她在自己的本鄉城鎭裏也能賺得同等的薪水而生活方面却是省得多了當然一個人能夠知道怎樣的去解决生活和静等時機便夠了但是女子們總要有一點特殊的本領以便做一個紐約城中成功的職業婦女競争是激烈的常有許多人等待着想在商業塲中找一個較好的位置</p>
<p>使婦女們在紐約成功究經要有那一種本領呢這也許是天賦的聰明伶俐不凡的訓練或是寶貴的經騐女子們具有可愛的個性的即使能力較差也能與大衆和洽爲人喜悦所謂聰明者常常是心靈上的巧妙與敏捷在創造的工作中像繪畫·廣告·宣傅·及報紙工作等意想的創作力最爲重要銀行投資保險地産等工作商業上的訓練必須充份採辦·商店管理及同類工作等從事於這種專門工作的機敏伶俐缺一不可如果做個人工作那末對於人的瞭解必須澈底凡是女子想在紐約謀生她智慧上的修養那初步訓練必先在紐約之外具有根底這樣子機會一到她就馬上可以運用了</p>
<p>婦女們在紐約商業上有名望而居高位的那種例證呌人添上許多勇氣臂如某女士是一家銀行的副經理當她發表意見時她的同事都很注意的聽從伊還有一位太太最近被舉爲某大服務公司的總理她在那公司裏服務了己經二十年起初的地位十分低微許多婦女在大商店裏位居要職她們的手中每年常須經營幾百萬圓的買賣這許多女子大概由下而上起初的職位並不重要她們願意犧牲一切以求專門事業的成功更有多位女士們擔任書報雜誌的重要編輯職務她們也是費了許多年份的學徒工作方才成功所以在目下婦女們實在是商業的前鋒她們所得到的酬勞與工作多不相稱男子做同樣工作的常常可以多得些酬金可是這種情况也續漸的改善了大約二十年之内女性所得到工作上的　酬將與男性完全一樣哩</p>
<p>怎樣産生生活上的成功並没有一個方式其中所包括的分子很多即使將那情形分析起來也不能適應於各個的塲所譬如兩個人都採用同樣的策略而結局大家不同每人對於自己就是一個試騐所對於有勇氣而肯冒險的女子對於願意吃苦而不怕清寂的女子對於决心努力的女子及有特殊本領或天賦技能的女子紐約總是伸了他的臂膊接引衆生</p>
<p>父母對於女兒到紐約去往往不加贊同他們的心目中視紐約的爲萬恶的淵藪許多父母的頭腦中以爲這個大城市中隨地都有神秘的危險巨大的恶魔潛伏着倘然一個女子具有堅忍熱力心想到紐約去那末機敏的父母必將帮助伊他們必須對伊的心靈平衡加以信任換一句話就是必須相信伊倘然女兒果然得到快樂與成功父母也應該要满足在另一方面講起來如果紐約是簡實不成個樣子那末女兒的重返故鄉也是件可賀的事許多满面愁容的女子那個不要在一分鐘裏整理行裝搭車回家如果她的家屬不向他説「我對你這樣説的」呀</p>
<p>願意工作和讀書相兼並進的女子在紐約可以得到許多越卓的機會哥倫比亞大學及其他學校都設有夜校課目多至數百種從哲學起到純粹的歌唱止應有盡有大學的課程可以在夜校裏修讀畢業或者一個女子可以撰讀幾種專門的課目商業課程像廣告銀行商品學等咸由著名能幹的敎授担任還有許多大公司加以贊助供給學生們隨時去實習商行方面對於職夜修學以求知識增進者都很注意有許多行家甚至願意支付一部份的學費不過日中做工夜間求學須有强固的精力所學必求成功在紐約各地方的距離常常很遠所以一個女子往往不能在同地方工作居住及讀夜書於是疲勞的地道行程高架車輛及其他代步等不能或少了</p>
<p>女子們到紐約去的須有嘗試的態度公充的批判然後用忠實的心去接受或放棄伊們必不能於同時立刻得到聲名與幸福在這個人羣如沸的中心點决</p>
<p>生不出魔力的嘘微（未完）</p>

<p>Zhang Ji Convenes</p>
<h3>Talks with Tianjin Business Representatives</h3>
<p>Emphasis on Group Organization. Tianjin: Zhang Ji convened more than 200 representatives of merchants from various trades at the General Chamber of Commerce at 2 PM on the 16th for talks. He stated that Hebei Province is a rich area in North China, producing coal, salt, iron, and aquatic products. Merchants should support peace. If foreign residents in the concessions have no ulterior motives, the central government will not harm them. China has sufficient individual ability, but weak group ability. Everything in the world requires strong group organization for efficiency. For example, if each person invests one copper coin, they can manage 400 million copper coins. Tianjin merchants can express their hopes to the government as much as possible, and he will ask the central government to adopt them upon his return to Beijing. Then, his secretary, Sheng Cheng, gave a speech on: 1. The success of Gandhi's non-cooperation movement in India; 2. The preparations that merchants should have for the abolition of unequal treaties, such as the decline of commerce in Turkey after the abolition of unequal treaties due to the British using a "five oxen dismembering" policy in Constantinople, the first European commercial center, to move the commercial center to Romania and control the economic lifeline of Turkey. To prevent the "dismembering" after the abolition of unequal treaties, we should concentrate the buying and selling power of the commodity market. Then, Wang Wendian, a representative from the Chamber of Commerce, bitterly described the painful situation of Tianjin merchants, hoping the government would find a way to solve it. The meeting adjourned after 5 PM. (Special dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Zhang Ji is scheduled to host a banquet for newspaper reporters at the Six Nations Hotel on the evening of the 17th. On the morning of the 16th, he attended the municipal Party headquarters' expanded commemorative week and gave a speech, stating that the Premier's forty years of struggle and immeasurable suffering led to the Republic of China, which is still swaying in the wind and rain today. We must work hard to cherish it to increase the country's status. China only has family organizations and no social organizations. The Premier's will awakens the masses with brotherly intentions, awakening the masses is not about leading a group of people to shout slogans and post slogans on the streets. The responsibility of our party is to organize the masses. Looking at China with a population of 400 million, it has no status in the world because it has no organization. If it can be organized, the national spirit can be promoted; otherwise, there is a danger of national subjugation and extermination. If we want to do a good job of the Kuomintang, everyone should have a direct relationship with the party. Those who joined small organizations in the past must reflect and change, and then the party can gradually develop. The speaker participated in the Xishan Conference faction and now knows his mistake. In recent years, those who run the party have had strong leadership desires and must reform themselves. We must know that we are following the Premier's instructions to organize the masses to serve the party and the country, not to organize the masses for personal gain. The meeting adjourned at 11 AM. (Special dispatch from the 16th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Unexpected Foreign Minister's Advocacy of Equality</h3>
<p>The Foreign Minister unexpectedly discussed the three major principles of foreign policy yesterday, stating that in order to achieve these three principles, all countries must be in a position of complete equality. Italy's foreign policy aims to eliminate the divide between the victorious and defeated countries. Today's Rome dispatch states that the Italian newspapers attach great importance to this speech, saying that Italy will advocate absolute equality at the International Disarmament Conference, without which it is impossible to expect European countries to cooperate harmoniously with each other. This is truly the most concise statement by those who advocate peace. However, it is very difficult to realize this claim. Since the end of the European War until recently, Germany has always been indignant, using the inequality between the victorious and defeated countries as a pretext. Now that the war has been extinguished, there should be no more lingering resentment of victory or defeat. However, to eliminate this resentment of victory or defeat cannot be achieved through empty words. The rights and obligations between the victorious and defeated countries must be truly equal before it can be achieved, and then it becomes purely a matter of fact. Therefore, to achieve absolute equality today, we must seek it in fact, which is what I mean by difficult.</p>
<p>Moreover, the so-called international equality is not only about eliminating the divide between the victorious and defeated countries. All unequal concepts between powerful countries and small countries must also be eliminated to achieve the goal. Today, there are many inequalities in the world. Small countries and small nations are oppressed, and their appeals to the League of Nations are heard every day. If we can base this idea of equality between the victorious and defeated on other issues in the world, we can free ourselves from the shackles of inequality and abolish all kinds of unequal treaties, so that we can realize true equality. Otherwise, the path to peace will still be long.</p>

However, the Consular Body has never been recognized by our country. If we request to add to it at this time, we would be admitting an illegal system. Moreover, we cannot recognize the organization of this Consular Body, except for the proper existence of the diplomatic corps under international public law and international practice. We can only endure it for the time being. After all legal rights issues are resolved, this minor issue can be easily resolved. (Special dispatch from the 16th)</p>

<h3>England France Italy</h3>
<h3>Three Countries Coordinate for Peace</h3>
<p>The Foreign Minister unexpectedly revealed his intentions in his speech. Henderson will use his mediation for the European League. French and Italian political negotiations will be held in Paris. National Agency Rome dispatch on the 15th: The newspapers here attach great importance to the Foreign Minister's speech in Congress yesterday and regard it as a sign of Italy's policy of peace and coordination, which can be called an extremely important event in the international community. The Foreign Minister unexpectedly said that Italy will advocate absolute equality at the future International Disarmament Conference, because it is impossible to expect European countries to cooperate harmoniously with each other without it. The newspapers paid great attention to this remark. The Foreign Minister's statement is actually a prelude to continued political negotiations between Italy and France. These negotiations will probably be held in Paris within a week, at which time the British Foreign Secretary Henderson will also use his mediation for the entire European Federation. The press also attaches great importance to the increasing affection between France, England, and Italy, and considers it to be a sign of Italy's increasing prestige. When the British Navy completed its exercise in the Mediterranean Sea before Easter, its visit to the Italian port of Gelaixi made the Italians feel very satisfied. As for the French fleet's visit to Italy, it is said that it will be held after all pending issues between Italy and France have been resolved.</p>

<p>Japanese Parliament</p>
<h3>Ends with Political Disputes</h3>
<p>The people have long been tired of the opposition party demanding that the Prime Minister attend the Diet. The General Budget Committee of the House of Representatives presented a great chaos. Telegraphic Communication Society Tokyo dispatch on the 16th: The 59th session of the Japanese Parliament has only ten days left. The government and party members are eager to maintain their regime and want to perfunctorily fulfill this session of the Parliament at once. The Seiyukai initially thought that a political change was imminent, but it was unexpectedly beyond expectations. They only wanted to impeach the government for a final struggle. Therefore, this session of the Parliament and the party and the opposition party were all plunged into disputes that had no direct interest to the people, and the curtain of the Parliament was closed. The people have long been tired of this kind of parliamentary politics.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society Tokyo dispatch on the 16th: The government and the party wanted to stop questioning at today's General Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, while the Seiyukai decided to request Prime Minister Hamaguchi to attend. Therefore, the two factions occupied the committee seats and the audience seats early in the morning to confront each other and wait. At 11 a.m., Chairman Takenouchi announced the meeting. Seiyukai's Sunada immediately stood up and said that the suspension of the affairs of the district court was such an important issue that it was negligent not to consult with the Cabinet. He needed to question Prime Minister Hamaguchi's responsibility and requested the chairman to invite Prime Minister Hamaguchi to attend. Minister of Justice Watanabe did not agree, and the venue fell into turmoil. At this time, Seiyukai's Shimada requested to speak on the progress of the proceedings, saying that the ministers avoided answering the committee's questions and could not proceed with the proceedings. Kudo of the Minseitō also stood up and said that if the Seiyukai obstructs the deliberations, please ask the chairman to suspend the questioning. Then, the Seiyukai members were furious and stood up and rushed to Kudo's seat. The venue was immediately plunged into a chaotic state that could not be contained. At 12 noon, it was announced that the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Russian Commercial Counselor Assassinated</h3>
<p>The Assailant, a Japanese National, Surrenders Himself to the Police Station; Two Possible Motives for the Assassination. Reuters, Tokyo, 16th. This morning at 9:00 AM, Mr. Anikiev, the Commercial Counselor of the Russian Embassy in Japan and the Russian Trade Representative, had just left his residence and entered his car to go to the embassy when an unidentified Japanese man pulled out a handgun from his pocket and fired three or four shots at him. Mr. Anikiev was hit twice and seriously injured. The assailant fled without a trace. Mr. Anikiev is 42 years old and has been in Japan for more than four years. Furthermore, it is reported that the assassin of Mr. Anikiev has surrendered himself to the police station. The man, named Sato, was formerly the manager of a certain fishing company. He confessed that he resented Russia's destruction of the Japanese fishing industry, hence his action. It is investigated that Sato had attempted to obtain a private concession for certain timber forests and negotiated with Mr. Anikiev unsuccessfully, resulting in a loss of 100,000 Japanese yen. Moreover, Sato had married a Russian woman and resided in Russia for twenty years. Recently, he returned to his home country alone. His wife, carrying their seven-year-old son, followed Sato to Japan, but was detained by Russian officials in Harbin. The motive for the assassination may stem from these two matters. Although Mr. Anikiev's injuries are severe, his life is not in danger.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th. The Soviet Russian Trade Representative, Yanikiev, was seriously injured this morning at 9:00 AM when he was shot while traveling by car from his home to the Russian embassy. The assailant fled the scene. His life is in danger.</p>
<p>Another telegram: The assailant who shot the Russian Trade Representative is named Sato Nobukatsu and is married to a Russian woman. He surrendered to the Metropolitan Police Department at 2:00 PM. Sato is currently an employee of the Bo'ai Trading Company and previously engaged in the fishing industry in Kamchatka and Vladivostok for nearly twenty years before recently returning to Tokyo. His motive for the assassination stems from resentment towards the representative's actions regarding business transactions and dissatisfaction with the North Sea fishing industry issue. His wife is a Russian national.</p>
<h3>German Political Assassinations Occur Repeatedly</h3>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 16th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 103rd Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the auditorium. Central Committee members Chu Minyi, Ding Weifen, Liu Luyin, Ma Chaojun, Ke Xing'e, and others, along with staff members from various departments and guests, totaling approximately 500 people, attended. Chairman Ding Weifen conducted the ceremony, after which Ma Chaojun reported, stating that Dr. Sun Yat-sen used the Three Principles of the People as the foundation of the Kuomintang, leading the Chinese nation and hoping to promote it to other nations in the world in the future. For many years, the party members and the public have been working hard on propaganda and training. However, there are still a small number of people with complex and divided ideologies who doubt the principles from time to time and fail to fully believe in them. The biggest reason is that the party's basic education is not comprehensive. Education on the Three Principles of the People is more important than any other education and must be emphasized. Efforts should be made to instill it into the public so that the general public understands the benefits and spirit of the principles, so that their beliefs are firm and they will not be confused by dissenting opinions. It is best for party members to focus on rural work and teach general children simple theories and common sense of the Three Principles of the People to establish the foundation of the party's fundamental education. It is believed that if every party member works hard in the countryside, at least twenty or thirty people in a village will receive social education,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>and the impression of the Three Principles of the People will be in their minds, and its effectiveness will be great. Observing that foreign Christianity in China can enhance the Chinese people's religious psychology by simple methods such as reciting scriptures and praying, let alone the Three Principles of the People, which are more upright than any religion, if universally taught, the psychology of believing in the principles will be several times greater than the psychology of believing in Christianity. Moreover, Italy's Mussolini has always regarded party ideology as an essential education for primary and secondary schools, and once in power, the whole country follows suit. American education also instills children with the revolutionary deeds of Washington and patriotic themes in primary schools, making them very admired. Therefore, basic education is indispensable. The meeting adjourned at 10 o'clock after the report.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, Zhu Peide, He Yaozu, Wang Boqun, Ma Fuxiang, Shao Yuanchong, Shao Lizi, Liu Ruiheng, Ru Yuli, Lin Xiang, Niu Yongjian, Chiang Dingwen, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Huang Musong, Ge Jingen, and staff members from the civil and military affairs departments, totaling over 300 people, attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony, followed by a speech by Yu Youren titled "Efforts That Should Be Made Regarding the Party's Platform Before the National Assembly." The speech was divided into three sections: the origin of the party's platform, the main purpose of the entire platform, and how to transform the party's platform into the people's platform. The gist was that the party has relied on the support of the people in the past to have what it has today. Therefore, in this period, it should further transform the platform into the people's platform. The method is to communicate the opinions of the party, the government, and the people, and to incorporate the platform into the provisional constitution as much as possible. Then the party, the government, and the people will work together, and the revolutionary goal will be easily achieved. As for the National Assembly, before the meeting is held, the government should conduct a general inspection of all past work, and to what extent the promotion of politics, the clarification of official governance, the abolition of exorbitant taxes, and the interests of the people have been carried out should be examined in detail in preparation for the report to the National Assembly. The speech is being compiled.</p>

<p>present his credentials. Earlier, at around 10:00 AM, the National Government dispatched staff officer Tang in car number one (municipal red license number one) to the Diplomatic Hotel to greet him. Tang was seated on the left and the Czech envoy on the right. Rows of infantrymen were stationed on both sides of the driveway inside the gate of the National Government, commanded by a regiment commander. When the Czech minister's car arrived, they presented arms in salute. The Czech minister was then led into the reception room by reception officer Liu Nai Fan. After a short rest, the Director of Ceremonies entered to announce that Chairman Chiang had arrived in full military dress uniform and was standing in the center of the hall. All civil and military officials of the National Government were also in formal dress, with civil officials on the east and military officials on the west, arranged in two rows led by the Chief of Civil Affairs and the Chief of Military Affairs, respectively.

The Czech minister bowed to the Chairman at the door of the hall, bowed again in the middle of the hall, and bowed once more before the Chairman. The Chairman returned the courtesies in full. The Foreign Minister then read out the Czech minister's full title to indicate the introduction. The Czech minister delivered a congratulatory speech, which was translated into Chinese by an interpreter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the translation was finished, the Czech minister presented his credentials, which the Chairman accepted and handed to the Foreign Minister, who read the response in Chinese, which was translated by the interpreter.

<p>Chairman's response: Your Excellency, Minister, today, as the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to China, you have presented the credentials of appointment from the President of your country, and I am deeply pleased to have the opportunity to meet with you. This is the first time that your country has sent an envoy to China, and I am especially happy to receive you.

<h3>Ministry of Finance</h3>
<h3>Eighteenth Fiscal Year Financial Report</h3>
<p>Respectfully submitted to the Political Council of the Central Executive Committee: We hereby compile a report on the financial situation of the Republic of China for the eighteenth fiscal year (from July 1, 1929, to June 30, 1930) and the general situation of the recent months of the nineteenth year, as follows:</p>
<p>During this year, the global economic situation was chaotic and declining. The impact of the upheaval on our country was particularly severe. With the unprecedented plunge in silver prices, import trade plummeted, and export trade could not achieve corresponding prosperity. Coupled with the rebellions of feudal warlords, the huge military expenditures were unprecedented since the establishment of the National Government. From spring to winter in the nineteenth year, there were warlords in the north and bandits in the south, so the central government's financial strain was self-evident. Fortunately, the rebellions of warlords were gradually suppressed at the end of the autumn of the nineteenth year, and the government was able to focus its efforts on necessary financial improvements. However, due to the sluggish business situation, the corresponding measures failed to achieve significant results. This difficult situation continues to this day.</p>
<p>The various facts and experiences of the nineteenth year are sufficient to show us that the national finances will not go bankrupt if the country is peaceful first. Now that peace has been realized, the financial difficulties ahead are still burgeoning. Only by relying on the concerted efforts of all the gentlemen of the party and the country to jointly plan for the financial aftermath and construction can we build the foundation of a new China.</p>
<p>Income and Expenditure</p>
<p>The following table is based on the report of the Accounting Department of this Ministry and contains the total income and expenditure of the Ministry of Finance for the eighteenth fiscal year. The report materials are richer than those of the previous year. However, all income and expenditure situations are based on direct income to the national treasury and reports from various provinces and regions. Those provinces and regions that have not submitted reports can only be left blank.</p>

<p>If we examine each tax revenue item by item, we will know that although there were the aforementioned difficulties during this year, tax revenue has indeed improved. The following is a list of categories under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance:</p>
<p>Customs duties: From February 1, 1930, import duties were changed to be levied in gold units. The original specific duties levied in Haikwan taels were converted to gold units at a rate of 1.50 gold units per Haikwan tael (each Haikwan gold unit is equal to 4.0197256 US dollars and 8035 Japanese yen). From March 16, 1930, the conversion rate was revised to 1.75 gold units per Haikwan tael. After the import duties were changed to gold units, the specific duties reverted to the old situation of the gold-silver ratio when the tariff rate was promulgated on February 1, 1929.</p>
<p>Since gold has become more valuable and silver has become cheaper, there has been a shortage of funds to repay foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties. After the change to gold units, customs revenue is based on gold, and even though the price of silver has fallen, various gold debts can still be repaid on schedule.</p>
<p>With the exception of Japan, the various countries have successively recognized China's tariff autonomy. After several consultations between the government and Japan, a treaty was formally concluded on May 10, 1930, and tariff autonomy was formally and completely recognized.</p>
<p>The following table shows the total customs revenue for the past three years:</p>
<p>Republic of China 17th Year Republic of China 18th Year Republic of China 19th Year (1928) (1929) (1930)</p>
<p>Import Tax 72,074,000 Yuan 166,241,000 Yuan 211,786,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Export Tax 42,939,000 Yuan 56,254,000 Yuan 55,378,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Re-export Tax 4,184,000 Yuan 5,636,000 Yuan 6,298,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Tonnage Dues 4,597,000 Yuan 4,925,000 Yuan 4,825,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Native Customs Duty</p>
<p>Imports 4,017,000 Yuan 2,920,000 Yuan 2,305,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Exports 804,000 Yuan 911,000 Yuan 943,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Normal Customs 5,370,000 Yuan 6,828,000 Yuan 9,654,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Tonnage Dues (Private Vessels) 238,000 Yuan 251,000 Yuan 254,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Total 133,223,000 Yuan 243,966,000 Yuan 291,444,000 Yuan</p>
<p>It is found that from the full year of the 17th year of the Republic of China to the 18th year of the Republic of China, the value of import trade increased by 6%, and the increase in customs duties was also implemented from February 1, 1929. However, the difference in import tax revenue between the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China was largely due to the incorporation of the 25% surtax and the kerosene special tax into the regular tax items in the 18th year. The import trade sharply declined from the 18th to the 19th year, but the tax revenue (measured in national currency) increased sharply. This was because import duties were changed to gold units after February 1, 1930. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Tang Shaoyi Arrives in Guangzhou to Return to His Ancestral Home</h3>
<p>Tang to Assume the Post of Head of the Zhongshan Model County Guangzhou Correspondence Tang Shaochuan, the newly appointed head of the Zhongshan Model County, arrived in Hong Kong on the 9th at 9:00 AM via the Dalat mail ship, the Modison, from Shanghai. Cai Chang and Zhong Rongguang, members of the Zhongshan County Training Committee, had arrived in Hong Kong earlier to greet him. The provincial government also sent Huang Qiang and others to welcome him. Tang stayed in Hong Kong overnight and then took the early Shenggang Longshan boat to the province at 8:00 AM on the 10th. Upon hearing the news, political figures from the province flocked to the Shenggang Wharf to welcome him in the afternoon, including Chen Mingshu, Chen Ce, Huang Qiang, and Ouyang Ju. The Longshan boat finally arrived on the provincial riverbank at 2:30 PM. After Tang disembarked, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers. The group then went to the Asia Hotel to meet and talk for about dozens of minutes before the welcomers left. Among those who came with Tang on the same boat was Jian Huanzhang (former supervisor of the Fengyang Customs). Tang went to Tui'en Garden that evening to attend a banquet hosted by Chen Mingshu, chairman of the provincial government. Dozens of military and political figures were present. Wang Boling, who came to Guangdong on the same ship as Tang, was also invited to attend. It is said that Wang came to Guangdong on official business and would stay for about two or three days before returning to Hong Kong and departing for Yunnan. Tang will only stay in the province for two days, and after discussing Zhongshan county affairs with Chairman Chen of the provincial government on the 10th, he plans to return to his ancestral home in Tangjiawan on the 12th. On the 11th, he will attend a banquet hosted by fellow Zhongshan natives in the province. According to Tang's conversations in both the province and Hong Kong, his mission in returning south is specifically for the Zhongshan county magistrate's matter. After consultation with the provincial authorities, he will set a date to return to Zhongshan to take office and will dedicate himself to the implementation of the constitutional government in Zhongshan county. The matter of opening the port of Zhongshan will continue. He has contacted Dutch engineers and plans to start surveying the port. This plan can be implemented once approved by the Zhongshan Constitutional Government Council. At the fastest, the surveying project will also take two or three years because the tides in the port are uncertain, so the surveying is more difficult. In the future, it will also be necessary to explore the seabed in the port to see if there are reefs underneath. If submerged reefs are discovered, the reefs will have to be bombed during construction. The central government has designated 100,000 yuan to handle the surveying. The draft surveying contract has also been drafted, and it can be formally signed and construction started after consultation with the chairman of the provincial government. Secondly, for the Zhongshan County administration plan, it is planned to first focus on public security and second, on financial transparency. If these two things are done well, other government affairs will be easily implemented. It is heard that Tang will attend a banquet for fellow natives today (the 11th) and then take a provincial-Macau boat to Macau at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th to return to Tangjiawan via Macau (March 11th).</p>
<h3>Troop Transfers in Southern and Western Shandong</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence Sun Lianzhong's troops have been ordered to depart for Jiangxi. The defense of western Shandong has been distributed and settled after a meeting between Han Fuqu and Ma Hongkui, and a report has been submitted to the central government for verification. It is heard that the Caozhou defense area in western Shandong will be filled by the civilian army of Gu Liangyou. Gu's troops are currently stationed in Jining and will depart within a few days. The Jining and Yuncheng area will be filled by the 85th Brigade of the 29th Division of Han's troops. The brigade has been newly reorganized into two regiments. The original second and third regiments have departed from Teng County and arrived at their destination. The Teng County defense area in southern Shandong will be filled by the cavalry regiment of Ma's troops. It has also departed from Tai'an and arrived at its destination. The defense area south of Teng County and Lincheng will be filled by the Central Army's Wang Jun's troops. They have also arrived. The first regiment of the 85th Brigade of Hou Zhaolin's troops, originally stationed in Lincheng, has now been transferred back to Jinan (14th).</p>
<h3>A New County Seat to be Established at Baodugu</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence Zhang Weicun of the Provincial Party Committee previously suggested to the provincial government that Baodugu, at the intersection of Lin, Yi, and Fei counties in the area, has been occupied by bandits for more than ten years, and the local people have been groaning under the oppression. He suggested that the area be divided into a new county to solve the problem with political force. The provincial government's administrative meeting resolved to order the Civil, Financial, and Construction Departments to send personnel for joint surveys to serve as a basis for verification. Later, Song Qi, a resident of the area, submitted a petition to the provincial government opposing the establishment of a new county seat. The provincial government also ordered Wang Zuzhu, a member sent by the Civil Affairs Department, to investigate and reply. After receiving the order, Wang went to the area at the end of December for an on-site survey and has now returned to Jinan. He submitted the survey results to the Civil Affairs Department for submission to the provincial government for review. The following is Wang Zuzhu's investigation report: "It has been found that the area where the three counties of Lin, Yi, and Fei meet has always been a place where bandits gather and move about. It has not been possible to eliminate them for twenty years. The Baodugu mountains in Lin County, Fei County, and Yi County are rugged and strategically important. Since ancient times, major bandits such as Sun Meiyao and Liu Heiqi have used them as their strongholds to resist surrender and use all means of kidnapping and looting. The local people have long been in dire straits and groaning under their iron hooves. In recent years, there have been many incidents in the Central Plains, and the central government has been using its full strength to engage in suppressing rebellions and quelling chaos. The bandits have been able to take the opportunity to steal and harass as they please. Under this situation, the poor people have abandoned their wives and children and scattered in all directions. Those with a little property have also been coerced into becoming bandits in order to survive. Those who are fierce and fierce do not hesitate to become accomplices of tigers to poison the living, resisting taxes and grain, and almost falling into a state of being outside the law. The reason for this is that the area is intertwined and the ground is mixed, and the distance from the county seats of Lin, Yi, Fei, and Yi counties is too far. The jurisdiction and control are always out of reach. As the saying goes, the place where flowers are planted is most easily transformed into a source of bandits and fugitives hiding. At this time, the bandits are rampant. It is difficult for the provincial government to use a large army to suppress and exterminate them in one fell swoop. In order to get to the root of the problem, it is necessary to establish a county and divide the administration to suppress and solve the problem with political force. This is an urgent need. During this survey, I widely inquired with the local people and gentry. They all said that after the county seat is established, we petty people will be able to increase the protection of our lives and property by relying on the power of the government, so we all hope that the new county seat can be realized as soon as possible. As for the increase in the burden on the people after the establishment of the county, I inquired with the leaders of various agencies and groups and party affairs personnel in each county. They said that the annual county administrative expenses have sufficient funds for regular tax grain and various taxes, and temporary construction expenses can be raised. It will not all be taken from the people. Moreover, the people have suffered from bandit disasters for a long time. How can they bear to increase their burden? In this survey, I have traveled through the three counties and visited the countryside for more than twenty days. The general public is almost unanimous in their request to add a new county seat. As for the original petition of Song Qi, people in the three counties all said that they did not know him. Before receiving the order, the reason was to truthfully report the reply."</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Consolidation Committee to be Established</h3>
<p>He Yingqin to Serve as Chairman. A telegram from Nanchang reports that He Yingqin, in order to unify the command for bandit suppression and consolidate Jiangxi's local party affairs, politics, and military, had previously drafted regulations for the Jiangxi Bandit Area Consolidation Committee and submitted them to the Central Government for promulgation and implementation. These regulations have now been approved by the Central Standing Committee and issued to Jiangxi. He is now beginning to organize the committee. It is reported that the committee members will include Chairman Lu, Finance Director Huang, Civil Affairs Director Wang, Education Director Jiang, Construction Director Gong, Liu Zhenqun (Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Headquarters), Liu Zuozhou (Organization Minister), Yin Jingrang (Training Minister), Tian Keming (Propaganda Minister), and Supervisors Sun and Wang. He will serve as the chairman. The internal organization is about to be completed. He also convened a meeting of the committee members at the headquarters on the 14th to prepare for the establishment procedures and the direction of progress. It is reported that the committee has concrete plans for the consolidation of party affairs, politics, and military affairs in the bandit suppression areas, which will be handed over to the relevant agencies for implementation. Party affairs, political, and military personnel will first be examined and approved by the committee before being assigned to the relevant agencies for appointment. Those who fail to perform their duties in party affairs, politics, and military affairs will also be punished in order to unify government orders and clarify rewards and punishments.</p>
<p>Minister He advocates for "work-for-relief" for the disaster victims in the bandit areas of Jiangxi. He has personally instructed Construction Director Gong to quickly plan and complete the Jiangxi-Guangdong, Jiangxi-Zhejiang, and Jiangxi-Hunan roads, and has also requested the Central Government to subsidize Jiangxi's road construction expenses or approve the issuance of road construction bonds to provide funds. At the same time, Commander-in-Chief Jiang also issued an order to Jiangxi Province regarding the construction of roads by bandit suppression troops. After receiving the order, the provincial government noted that Donggu is located between Ji'an, Jishui, Yongfeng, Xingguo, Taihe, Ningdu, Le'an, and other counties, with complex mountainous terrain and inconvenient transportation. Therefore, Chairman Lu specifically proposed at the provincial affairs meeting yesterday to build a road from Ji'an to Donggu to open up southwest transportation and prevent the communists from using this remote location as a base again. The provincial affairs meeting immediately approved the proposal and handed it over to the Army Survey Bureau for surveying and planning for construction. (March 14)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Bandit Suppression in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The Hunan situation is the most critical, and financial issues must be resolved first. The situation of the communists in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi is currently the most serious problem in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The government is deeply concerned, and the people are distressed, all eagerly hoping to eliminate the fierce bandits and establish peace for the people. Now, Military and Political Minister He is stationed in Nanchang, planning and strategizing, and the armies are converging for a general offensive. The military problem is expected to be resolved soon. However, if we want to fundamentally eradicate the communists, we cannot rely solely on military means. Recently, a friend from Hunan mentioned this matter, which has considerable value.</p>
<p>Communist troops are divided into two categories: those with guns are called the Red Army, and their organization is similar to that of the army; those without guns are called the Red Guards, and the weapons they use are mostly javelins, commonly known as "shuttle spears." They are forcibly formed from peasants, workers, and rogue elements. The Red Army is elusive and unpredictable, like the roving bandits of the late Ming Dynasty and the religious rebels of the Qing Dynasty, specializing in moving along borders and fleeing into dangerous areas. They only exert themselves in combat when they want to take advantage of vulnerabilities to attack prosperous cities and loot money, salt, rice, and cloth for military use. Otherwise, they specialize in using the Red Guards to cause disturbances. When the main forces arrive, the so-called Red Army absolutely avoids them to preserve their strength. The so-called Red Guards gather to become bandits when the Red Army arrives, and disperse to become civilians when the Red Army leaves. In places like Pingxiang and Liuyang in eastern Hunan, Ji'an and its vicinity in Jiangxi, and Macheng, Huang'an, and Yangxin in Hubei, banditry is prevalent. It is not that the intelligence and ideology of the bandits are sufficient to deceive the people, but rather that the people in these areas have long been affected by banditry, and good people have scattered and fled. Most of those who remain are undesirable elements, and the government troops cannot be stationed for long to protect the good. Even if there are a few good people, they dare not disobey the orders of the bandits to preserve their lives. Taking the Hunan case as an example, as soon as the main forces arrive in Pingxiang and Liuyang, there is no trace of bandits. The troops burn and loot the day after they are stationed. Therefore, the Hunan Provincial Government, in view of this, has specifically established the Pingliuyang Pacification Office, which focuses on three things: first, encouraging local militias to strictly implement the baojia system to protect the good and investigate bandits; second, recruiting vagrants and establishing loan offices to provide funds to enable people to resume their businesses, and directly providing relief to the extremely poor; third, propagating justice to prevent the foolish people from being misled. Currently, great efforts are being made, and there have been some effects, but the situation has not yet been clarified because of the exhaustion of financial resources, which has prevented the implementation of all the affairs from being fully realized. The most difficult thing is that military pay and government expenses cannot be paid on time every month. Often, when troops encounter bandit alarms and are ordered to provide assistance, even though it is only a hundred miles away, they cannot rush to the front lines because they cannot pay for food. Before the abolition of the lijin tax, the provincial capital and major cities and towns could barely cope because of the lijin tax revenue.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>(9)</p>
<h3>Important News Summary</h3>
<p>After the abolition of the lijin tax, the business tax has not yet been effectively implemented, and the people have suffered greatly from banditry and have not yet recovered. Therefore, the authorities feel helpless. The situation in Jiangxi is similar to this. Without large-scale financial resources for relief and various pacification measures, even if a large army gathers, it can only be effective temporarily. As soon as the troops are withdrawn, the old state can be restored in no time. It can be asserted that Hunan is the hub of Sichuan and Hubei. If Hunan is secure, then Jiangxi and Hubei will also be easy to manage. If Hunan is not secure, then the harm will not only be limited to Jiangxi and Hubei, but also Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong will be separated from the Central Plains. The upper reaches of the Yangtze River are extremely important. Therefore, the central government's current governance of the communists should first focus on the finances of Hunan Province, so that those responsible for bandit suppression can strive to comfort the refugees, pacify the local good people so that they can protect each other, and the bandits will have no way to grow stealthily. This is the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Lu'an Disaster Relief Association</p>
<h3>Please Request the Shanxi Provincial Government to Quickly Plan for Relief</h3>
<p>And Please Punish the Culprits and Withdraw the Garrisoned Troops. A telegram from Taiyuan reports that the people of the eight counties under the jurisdiction of Lu'an, who are residing in the provincial capital, have jointly established the Lu'an Eight Counties Disaster Relief Association to engage in relief efforts due to the successive military disasters and banditry in the counties and the exploitation of the people. The mutiny by Yang Xiaoou's troops in Changzhi this time is a rare catastrophe in recent years. Yesterday, they submitted a petition to the provincial government requesting the implementation of emergency relief, the punishment of the culprits, and the withdrawal of the garrisoned troops. The petition detailed the Changzhi mutiny: "On the 26th of last month, around 12 o'clock at night, the garrisoned troops in Changzhi County, Lu'an, suddenly mutinied. Gunshots rang out all night. The mutinying soldiers looted shops and stores in the streets, such as Guanghua Xing, the Provincial Bank, Luyang Chun, and Jichang Xiang, more than 140 in total, and beat the shopkeepers, and the cries of pain were unbearable. The mutinying soldiers ran rampant and no one cared. By 2 pm on the 27th, the gunshots had subsided slightly, and the streets, alleys, city gates, and city walls were guarded by troops. Under this chaotic state of order, it goes without saying that the property of merchants and civilians was unprotected, and even escape from the city was impossible. On the night of the 27th, the mutinying soldiers again looted civilian households, and almost no one escaped unharmed in the northwest streets. This lasted until 1 pm on the 28th, and the mutinying soldiers were still searching the civilian households and shops as much as possible. In the evening, the 4th and 5th Divisions posted public notices to reassure the people, and order was slightly restored. However, the frightened people had nowhere to flee. Staying in the city was life-threatening, and leaving the city would turn them into beggars. All the people suffered this great catastrophe. Who has no parents? Everyone in the world hates it. The representatives, for the sake of the fathers and elders in their afflicted homeland, established the Lu'an Eight Counties Disaster Relief Association to speak for the people. We humbly request the Chairman to quickly provide relief, punish the culprits, and maintain the safety of the 600,000 people of Lu'an. We respectfully submit the requests as follows: (1) We request emergency relief. According to the investigation, more than 140 shops and more than 500 civilian households were looted in the February 26th mutiny. They immediately had no way to make a living, and the cries of misery were everywhere. The suffering of the people has been the worst since the Xinhai Revolution. Before a detailed investigation of this major disaster can be carried out, emergency relief should be provided to save lives. We plan to request an allocation of 200,000 yuan in emergency relief, more than 300 piculs of food, and more than 5,000 sets of cotton clothing so that the disaster victims can receive great kindness. This will not only be an expression of gratitude, but also from a political perspective, emergency relief should be provided to the disaster victims. This should be promptly reviewed and approved by Your Excellency. (2) Punish the culprits. According to the investigation, the February 26th mutiny was reportedly caused by the issue of troop reduction, the fear of dismissed officers, and the anger of soldiers who had their pay deducted. The two combined to provoke a mutiny that disrupted the entire city and harmed merchants and civilians. How could the common people suffer this great catastrophe? Yang Xiaoou, the commander of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions, and also the commander of the Shangdang Garrison, was completely unaware of the matter beforehand and did not remedy it afterward. The magistrate of Changzhi County, Ge Jingguang, fled the official residence barefoot as soon as he heard gunshots on the night of the 26th and took refuge in a civilian residence. The chief of the Public Security Bureau also failed to provide any protection, and the police fled, losing horses and firearms completely. These political officials were busy protecting their own lives in the face of the mutiny, which is unforgivable. Moreover, after the mutiny, they neither reported to the authorities nor quickly took measures to provide relief to the disaster victims, but only lightly described the matter and covered up their faults in a report to the provincial government, saying that the Changzhi troops had a conflict due to a misunderstanding and that only a dozen merchants and civilians were affected. It is like deceiving the superiors and deceiving the subordinates, ignoring the lives and property of the people. They should be immediately dismissed, investigated, and severely punished to appease the people of Lu'an. The mutinying troops who initiated the mutiny should be investigated to identify the ringleaders and bring them to justice to uphold the prestige of the state and extend the law. This should be reviewed and approved by Your Excellency. (3) Compensate for the losses. The February 26th mutiny caused losses to more than 700 merchants and civilians. The government should investigate the amount of property lost and the number of people who died as a result of the looting, submit a list, and allocate a large sum of money from the provincial government for relief and rewards so that the displaced and distressed merchants and civilians can prolong their lives and try to recover. Then, although the people of Lu'an have suffered a great catastrophe in the past, they will still be grateful and remember Your Excellency in the future. This should be reviewed and approved by Your Excellency. (4) Withdraw the garrisoned troops. It has been half a month since the February 26th mutiny, and the troops in Changzhi City are still holding each other in a state of readiness to fire. If the division commanders and regimental commanders do not take measures to resolve the situation, there is fear of a second or third military conflict, burning, and looting. We earnestly request that a senior official be selected to handle the matter properly. If safe troop reduction can be achieved, another suitable location should be selected to garrison the border to eliminate future troubles. The previous garrisoned troops in various places in Lu'an procured forage grass and charcoal, half by requisition and half by negotiated purchase. Requisition has left ten houses empty, and negotiated purchase only provides supplies without payment. Therefore, the amount of money advanced for negotiated purchases in the eight counties often reaches hundreds of thousands of yuan, and at least 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. How can our people be born in the Lu'an eight counties of Shanxi? It is heartbreaking to hear and painful to say. This should also be reviewed and approved by Your Excellency. The above four requests are urgent and cannot be chosen. They are earnest requests from the bottom of our hearts and cannot be delayed. The representatives respectfully present the facts on behalf of the more than 700 disaster victims and the 600,000 people of the eight counties of Lu'an, begging for a firm promise to save the people from disaster. The need is urgent and awaits orders." (March 12)</p>
<p>Liaoning Cotton Spinning Factory Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>This factory is a promising enterprise in the eastern provinces, but it is currently in a difficult period and must work hard. A telegram from Shenyang reports that the Liaoning Cotton Spinning Factory was established in the 8th year of the Republic of China (1919). At that time, the European War had just ended, and the Allied countries suffered heavy losses due to the long war. People's livelihoods were declining, industries were depressed, the supply of production was insufficient to meet the needs of consumption, tax rates were rising daily, and prices were rising, especially for yarn and cloth. The yarn and cloth used by the 30 million people of the three eastern provinces were purely foreign goods, and the huge amount of leakage can be imagined. Therefore, Wang Yongjiang, with the approval of Zhang Zuolin, proposed to prepare for the establishment of a cotton spinning factory and ordered the Finance Department to draft measures to determine the capital amount of 4.5 million silver dollars, equivalent to 3.6 million national currency at that time. It was jointly funded by government and merchants. In June of the 9th year of the Republic of China, an order was placed for 10,000 spindles and 100 looms. In September, notices were sent to various counties to recruit commercial shares. In October, the factory site was surveyed and determined to be located north of the Shijianfang outside the Xiaoxibianmen in Liaoning, within the boundaries of the commercial port. In the 10th year of the Republic of China, Tong Zhaoyuan was appointed as the factory director. In March, an office was established in the old civilian houses on the factory site. After that, the preparation matters were transferred from the Finance Department to the factory for direct handling. All construction was completed in order, and another 10,000 spindles, 100 looms, and all the electrical machinery were purchased. As the factory affairs became increasingly complex, Factory Director Tong was promoted to general manager, and Lin Chengxiu was appointed as assistant manager. After more than a year, they resigned one after another, and Sun Zuchang was appointed as the general manager by the official shareholders. After arriving at the factory in October of the 11th year of the Republic of China, the project gradually came to fruition. All the machinery arrived, and workers and apprentices were recruited and settled, and equipment was actively carried out. In March of the 12th year of the Republic of China, a shareholders' meeting was convened to elect Han Gangling as assistant manager. After taking office, he provided a lot of assistance to the factory affairs. On July 16th of that year, the machinery was started, and the official opening was on October 1st. Assistant Manager Han resigned due to illness at the 6th shareholders' meeting in the 18th year of the Republic of China. Wang Guangen was publicly elected as assistant manager by the commercial shareholders and took office on March 1st of that year. In August, 50 looms were added. The factory had profits in previous years, especially in the 18th year of the Republic of China. Therefore, at the shareholders' meeting in the 19th year of the Republic of China, it was decided to expand the business and add 10,000 spindles. The machinery has now arrived on the scene and is being installed. Last year's business had a net loss of more than 10.51 million silver dollars due to various unfavorable factors, equivalent to more than 210,000 current silver dollars. If there are no special circumstances, this year's business is expected to have a profit of about 200,000 current silver dollars. The factory convened its 8th shareholders' representatives, directors, and supervisors, more than 50 people, at noon on the 11th of this month. The meeting was chaired by General Manager Wang Guangen. First, the chairman delivered an opening speech, saying that General Manager Sun (Zuchang) of the factory went to Nanjing with Minister Liu of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on December 26th of the 19th year of the Republic of China to serve as the director of the Administration Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The factory affairs were handled by his brother on his behalf. On February 1st of this year, he was ordered by the provincial government to appoint his brother as the general manager of the factory. However, his brother's talent is weak, and he is deeply afraid of failing the trust of the authorities and the expectations of the shareholders. Moreover, the current business is not as easy to develop as in the past. For example, although customs duties can be autonomous, there is a reciprocity agreement with Japan, and 62 of the 101 items are not included in this increase in customs duties. That is to say, the large import quotas for cotton yarn and cotton cloth are also within the scope of the reciprocity agreement, which will expire on May 16th of the 20th year of the Republic of China. Therefore, this customs duty has not increased during this period. During this period, I am deeply afraid that Chinese yarn factories will not be able to make any progress. Now, most of our customers in Daoyang City are farmers. They have already gone bankrupt and are being suppressed by foreign goods. For example, the Liaoyang Yarn Factory is nearby. In terms of electricity, it can use cheap electricity from the Fushun Power Plant, and the raw materials and products can evade taxes and various expenses are lighter than ours. It uses small prices to suppress us. Therefore, the colleagues in our factory are in a state of fear every day. If the factory affairs cannot be developed, it will be unfair to the shareholders, and the future of our Northeast industry will be hopeless. Next, there were six reports on factory affairs, including reports on the election of commercial shareholders, directors, and supervisors, saying that the position of commercial shareholder, director, and assistant manager of the factory was held by the humble person. On February 1st of this year, I was transferred to serve as the official shareholder, director, and general manager of the factory by order of the province. The vacancy left behind should be filled by the first candidate director according to the regulations, and then the assistant manager should be elected from the commercial shareholders. The commercial shareholder supervisors elected for the seventh time have now expired. Please elect two commercial shareholder supervisors and two candidates according to the regulations to comply with the regulations. Finally, it was resolved that the Fengyang stock should be changed to current silver dollars. Yuan Zhaoqing, the representative of Shenyang County, was elected as the commercial shareholder director. Da Yaoshan, the representative of Huade County, was elected as the commercial shareholder supervisor. The meeting adjourned. (March 11)</p>
<p>Qingdao City Promotes Labor Education</p>
<p>The Social Education Bureau and the Education Bureau have formulated implementation measures. A telegram from Qingdao reports that labor education in Qingdao City has not been developed. The municipal government has been unable to organize it due to insufficient funds, and industry and commerce have not paid attention to it due to business relations. Even the worker schools attached to factories are mostly nominal. Last year, the Social Education Bureau and the Education Bureau formulated implementation measures for supplementary schools for factory workers and ordered all factories to comply with them, but so far, no results have been seen. Now, the municipal government authorities, at the beginning of the period of political tutelage, believe that various constructions are urgently needed, and labor education is extremely important to society. Therefore, it should be actively organized. The Social Education Bureau and the Education Bureau have formulated promotion and rectification measures and submitted them to the municipal government meeting for approval. They will be implemented soon. The measures are as follows: (A) Regarding promotion, 1. Assign personnel to contact the British American Tobacco Company to establish a supplementary school for workers and a school for workers' children, similar to the regulations of the Shanghai factory, and prepare for their establishment in the shortest possible time. 2. Assign personnel to contact the Da Kang, Fuji, Baolai, and other banknote factories to restore the suspended worker schools. 3. Assign personnel to contact the Zhenye Match Company to restore the suspended worker school. 4. Assign personnel to contact the Minsheng Factory to open a supplementary school for workers. (B) Regarding rectification, 1. Quickly establish a Municipal Labor Education Committee. 2. Appoint one inspector to be responsible for handling labor education affairs. 3. Register the vocational teachers of each school, and those who are qualified will be given certificates and allowed to return to their original positions. Those who are unqualified will be notified to the original school to hire other suitable personnel. 4. Guide worker children's schools to hold parent-teacher conferences, exhibitions, recreational performances, and speeches. 5. Guide each school to expand funding and improve facilities. (March 13)</p>

According to nearby residents, when the Dangkou ferryboat was sailing to Meili on the 15th, there were indeed several plainclothes men holding guns and ordering it to stop. The ferryboat escaped by speeding up. Subsequently, a boat carrying chicken feathers was intercepted, but it was released because there were no valuables.

The Public Security Bureau has ordered a strict investigation. A Large Number of Vagrants Escaped from the Reformatory. The Wang Feiji Reformatory in the city has more than 300 vagrants who are required to work in the workshop every day. At night, they are divided into dormitories and guarded by several police officers stationed at the reformatory. Yesterday (the 16th), at half past noon, when the vagrants were about to go to the workshop after finishing their lunch, a group of vagrants suddenly rushed out of the workshop with carrying poles, benches, and other objects. Since the gates were tightly guarded, they destroyed the wall behind the workshop, and all the vagrants escaped through the hole in the wall. After escaping, the vagrants scattered and fled in the park. When the vagrants rushed out of the wall, Wang, the director of the reformatory, immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau's second branch and the Public Security Bureau's detective team to suppress them and round them up. Gu A'gen, Wang A'gen, Ma Xiaojiangbei, Shen A'er, and other 14 people were captured on the spot. Zhao Shidi, Xu Shoukui, Lu A'ba, Chen Fulin, Xu A'mu, and other 26 people escaped.

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from the Newly Organized 12th Division</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read an electrical dispatch in your newspaper's special column on the 10th of this month about the recent situation of the Ping-Han Railway being open to traffic. The dispatch said that the Ping-Han Railway was blocked because Yuan Ying's troops mutinied and Yuan sent a team to suppress them, killing a brigade commander and a regiment commander. Yesterday, the mutineers and bandits had been defeated and fled into the mountains, and railway workers had returned to their posts. We are very surprised to hear this. After investigation, it was found that our division's troops, previously stationed in Minggang Zhengyang, were transferred to Liulin and Jiazhai to suppress bandits. Originally, a brigade's strength was used to fight alone against a large number of enemies, and ammunition and supplies were lacking, resulting in the death of Brigade Commander Hou Zhenhua of our division, and some losses. Later, a counterattack was launched and the situation was quickly restored. There was no mutiny. What your newspaper published must be a rumor. Please correct it immediately to avoid confusing the public. Thank you. Yuan Ying, March 13th.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Commends Fujian Provincial Department of Education. According to a report submitted by Cheng Shiwei, Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, on the recent principles and methods for handling education, the original text is very long, and its main points are: (1) Preparation of Education Funds: In the past year, the local area has been unstable, transportation has been blocked, and salt surtax revenue has been sharply reduced. The education funds are in serious deficit. More recently, due to the centralized allocation of salt surtax to the central government, the special education funds have been fundamentally shaken. The director immediately met with the Director of the Finance Department, the Salt Transport Envoy, and the Director of the Education Funds Management Office of the Auditing Branch to discuss allocating and reducing various expenses in the salt affairs, and the education funds can be received on average about 113,000 yuan per month within ten months, which is barely enough to cover the expenses. As for the local fundraising for education expenses in various counties, most of them are sporadic miscellaneous taxes. Except for one or two special counties, the monthly amount is no more than two or three thousand yuan, and the less is only a few hundred yuan per month. The deficit is extremely high, and there is no way to develop. It is currently implementing reduction and exemption of all donations and taxes similar to likin, or not quickly raise subsidies, local education will inevitably be completely suspended. The director immediately issued a notice to various county bureaus to list the nature and amount of the original school funds in detail and report them. On the one hand, he negotiated with the Finance Department to jointly send personnel to various counties to reorganize the school funds and planned to raise business tax to save the situation. (2) Maintaining the Independence of Educational Administration: The way to maintain it is divided into three points: 1. Actively accept constructive comments and guidance. Educational academics are constantly changing and have no limit. The expression of social opinions is of course very welcome, but all irresponsible criticisms are often ignored. 2. The appointment, removal, and performance evaluation of school personnel are all based on talent as the standard, and not on personal relationships. 3. All administrative matters are handled in accordance with statutory procedures, with emphasis on the rule of law and not on personal relationships that can be changed at will. The director adhered to the principles and shared them with his colleagues. (3) Education Promotes Self-Cultivation (should exercise the body, increase knowledge, hone morality, and strive for morality). (4) Rectification of School Spirit (5) Convening of Local Education Conferences. In addition, various regulations have been separately formulated and special commissioners have been appointed to actively handle matters such as the promotion of mass education, the establishment of research associations for various subjects, the joint examinations of graduating students from various schools, the examination and investigation of term exams, the strict investigation of private schools and the determination of their subsidies, and the examination of foreign students and the raising of tuition fees. The Ministry of Education instructed: "The report is received and reviewed. The principles and methods for reorganizing education proposed by the Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education are all able to grasp the essentials and are deeply commendable. It is hoped that they will be carried out practically in order to develop education in Fujian Province."</p>
<h3>Strange Forms of the Anhui University Disturbance</h3>
<p>Students Missing, Teachers and Students Accuse Each Other. The disturbance at Anhui Provincial University has not been resolved for a long time. There are some strange forms in this:</p>
<p>Students Missing. The school expelled eleven students in the second batch on February 28. Military police escorted them out of the school. A student named Hong Gen was also among the eleven. After leaving the school, the students said that he was missing. Students from the same county (Sihong籍) requested the school authorities and the Public Security Bureau to search for him. Hong has not yet appeared. It is difficult to confirm whether he is missing. Teachers and Students Accuse Each Other. Xue Liangshu, the director of general affairs of the school, was severely beaten by students at the school gate on February 26. Xue immediately accused students Wu Zhaoshu et al. (those who were expelled in the first batch) of the crime of assault and insult to the Public Security Bureau. After the Public Security Bureau summoned Wu et al., they transferred the case to the court as a criminal case. The court held a trial on March 6. Xue had already left Anhui. The representative of the school's administrator appeared in court. The court refused to accept the case on the grounds that the evidence was inconsistent. So Wei et al. filed a counter-accusation against Xue for false accusation. It has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>President Resigns. President Yang Lianggong knew that things could not be done and submitted his resignation to the provincial government. Yang has left the school and is temporarily replaced by Chang Daozhi, the director of general affairs. It is said that the new president will be resolved after the new Director of Education arrives in Anhui.</p>

<p>Join Jinda. Comrade Yang Yonglu and the Feng Yong Walking Team arrived at Jinda yesterday. Deng Jinhui and Deng Huagao of the Guangdong Boy Scout National Walking Team have walked through twelve provinces for two years and three months. The places they have passed have been welcomed by people from all walks of life. Now they have invited their old classmate Yang Yonglu, who is now at Jinda, to participate. Yang has walked through seven provinces in North China. It is now scheduled to take a boat to Hanzhong next Tuesday, and then walk into Sichuan, turning to Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, and then go to the British, Dutch, French, and American colonies, the South Pacific islands, and the Philippine Islands. Then, via India and Tibet, they will go to the northwestern provinces. Also yesterday, seven members of Feng Yong's walking team arrived in Shanghai. Jinda immediately sent Yang Yonglu and Li Banglian as representatives of the school to receive them.</p>
<p>Also News. A group of seven people from the Liaoning Feng Yong University Hiking Group, two of whom stayed in Beijing due to business, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Jinda University held a meeting to welcome the group. The group is now staying at the YMCA dormitory. A group member told people that they need to stay in Shanghai for a week to visit various university institutions and groups to learn from them.</p>
<h3>China</h3>
<p>The Chinese Language and Literature Society will give a lecture today. The Chinese Language and Literature Society was established on March 1st and was initiated by Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai. It is scheduled to hold its first lecture at the Library of the Yijingyuan (one) in No. 23 Yuanmingyuan Road (near Sichuan Road) at half past noon today. Dr. E.V. AN MORGAN of the Shanghai Kwang Hsueh Publishing Society will be the speaker. The topic is Chinese Language and Writing and its problems, etc. Dr. Morgan is English and in his old age, but he is in good health and eager to learn. He is currently engaged in translating Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching into English. His English writings on Chinese language and writing research are all excellent. Those who want to hear the doctor's speech are requested to come early. For the convenience of Chinese and foreign men and women, the lecture will be in English, but translators will be responsible for translating when necessary. The lecture site displays Romanized books of various important Chinese dialects and phonetic symbols for reference.

<h3>Zheng Hongnian Speaks</h3>
<p>The Three Principles of the People and the Labor Ambassador's Mission. The National Labor University held a memorial week at 8:00 am yesterday. President Wang Jingqi presided over the meeting and Jinda President Zheng Hongnian spoke on the Three Principles of the People and the Labor Ambassador's Mission. He said that in recent years, the world's changes have been extremely great, especially the changes in the thinking of young people. The reason is purely a social problem, in essence, an economic problem. Young people like to study this kind of problem, but how can it be solved? From this, we can see the greatness of the President's Three Principles of the People, and the Principle of People's Livelihood is the main way to solve this problem. The President said that hands are omnipotent and everything in the world is made by both hands. Human beings are inherently laborers and should do their best. What is called labor is wealth. What we enjoy should be enjoyed by our labor. If we do not understand the sacredness of labor, we will inevitably (1) have conflicts with capital and no one will be willing to use labor (2) reduce production efficiency and society cannot live in peace. It is most difficult to talk about labor education in China. Your school has a school of social sciences, and its purpose is very ingenious. Hands and brains are combined into one, and efforts are made from a scientific perspective on how to promote production, how to thoroughly defeat imperialist aggression, how to solve social problems, and eliminate all struggles, starting from the President's fraternity, to build the Republic of China, to advance to the Great Harmony, the kingly way, and to seek world peace. Therefore, I hope that the students of Laoda will respond with their hearts and hands, as the saying goes, get their hearts and hands, and cultivate a great personality to complete the mission of the labor ambassador, etc. Zheng cited examples as proof, and the audience was very moved. After the speech, President Wang thanked him on behalf of the audience and encouraged the students.</p>

Yesterday was the first time that Wang Fuquan, editor of the Koka Book Store of the Japanese Imperial University, was invited to give a lecture on the topic of Literature and Society. First, Professor Zha Mengji of the school introduced him, and then Wang gave a lecture on the relationship between literature and society, elaborating as much as possible, and the audience was moved.</p>

<h3>United Cup Finals: Post Office A vs. Guangdong</h3>
<p>March 28th at the Central Auditorium, see who will be the champion. The United Cup Competition, organized by the Chinese Ping Pong United Association, has this year (first session) a total of 24 participating teams. After eight weeks of round-robin matches, the Post Office Union A team and the Guangdong Ping Pong Association of Shanghai team are the strongest, and since their formation, they have been invincible and gained the right to the finals. The next strongest teams are Qing Lian, Post Office B, Ying Hua, Jin Xing, and Qi Bu, but unfortunately Jin Xing and Ming Bu withdrew midway due to circumstances, failing to finish the competition, which inevitably diminishes the splendor of this year's competition. The Guangdong team's players include Lu Zhongqiu (captain), a Far Eastern representative known for his fierce attacks; Luo Hongsheng, known for his ingenious techniques; and Huang Xiangfa, known for his steadfast defense. In addition, there are Hong Kong champion Wu Jiangleng, and Ruan Yaohui, Huang Anbang, Tan Wenju, and other famous players. The Post Office A team has Lu Xiulu (leader), known for his offensive and urgent style; Li Fushu (captain), known for his combined attack and defense (both are Far Eastern athletes); and Zhu Kuisheng, known for his hard and fast style. The remaining players, Xu Duo (sports director and administrator), Wang Huizhang, Zhu Wenlin, Lu Shihong, Zhang Fudu, Chen Wen, Shen Defu, and Fei Geng, are all emerging stars. Both sides have equally talented players and are evenly matched, making it extremely difficult to predict who will win the championship. The association's staff has recently been actively preparing for the finals, which are scheduled to be held on the evening of Saturday, March 28th, at 7:30 PM at the Central Auditorium on North Sichuan Road. The third set of results are as follows: Post Office A defeated Bao Gong 5 to 4, Qing Lian defeated Le Yi 8 to 1, Post Office A defeated Post Office B 5 to 4, Qing Lian defeated Ying Hua 9 to 0, Post Office A defeated Hu Xing 8 to 1, Ying Hua defeated Tong Yi 5 to 4, Post Office A defeated Qing Zi 8 to 1, Ying Hua defeated Qing Zi 7 to 2, Post Office A defeated Liang Lu 9 to 0, Tong Yi defeated Bao Gong 7 to 2, Post Office A defeated Le He 7 to 2, Tong Yi defeated Le Yi 5 to 4, Post Office B defeated Tong Yi 7 to 2, Qing Nian defeated Ying Hua 7 to 2, Post Office B defeated Qing Nian 9 to 0, Qing Nian defeated Le He by default, Post Office B defeated Hu Xing 5 to 4, Qing Zi defeated Qing Nian 5 to 4, Guangdong defeated Tong Yi 5 to 4, Le Jia defeated Ji Ping by default, Guangdong defeated Hu Xing by default, Le Jia defeated Qing You by default, Guangdong defeated Qing Zi 9 to 0, Le Yi defeated Ji Ping by default, Guangdong defeated Le He 5 to 4, Hu Xing defeated Bao Gong 9 to 0, Guangdong defeated Bao Gong 6 to 3, Ji Ping defaulted twice and lost the qualification for this competition. The match between Hu Xing and Le Jia was inconclusive due to a dispute, and the truth at the time is difficult to ascertain. It is now scheduled for the two teams to replay on the 21st (Saturday) at Jian De Hall, with Xu Duo as the referee. Teams that have postponed matches should quickly choose a date to make up the matches.</p>
<h3>French Football Team Wins 1-0 Against Germany</h3>

<h3>Regarding the Calligrapher and Painter of Hengyang, Zeng and Wei</h3>
<p>— Ji Ji</p>
<p>The two elders of Hengyang, Zeng Ransou and Wei Ruosou, were born in the same village, studied together in their youth, and competed in examinations, treating each other as formidable enemies. Their births were also on the same year, same month, and same day, only a few hours apart. For more than ten years, they have lived together in Shanghai, entertaining themselves with calligraphy and painting, visiting each other morning and night, regardless of wind or rain, and have always been the same. Last year, they had a cooperative agreement to work together at the age of seventy, but Ransou suddenly returned to the mountains in late autumn. Ruosou cried uncontrollably. The deep friendship between the two elders can be seen from this. Ransou's works are unrestrained and famous all over the world. Ruosou closes his door and sweeps away visitors, remaining silent and unknown. In fact, connoisseurs have long concluded that Ransou's calligraphy and painting are vigorous and eccentric. Ruosou's style is unconstrained, peaceful, and purely natural, perhaps even exceeding it. In the past, after Qing Daoren's death, calligraphy and painting matters were entrusted to Ransou. Now that Ransou has passed away, they will inevitably be entrusted to Ruosou again. After all, there are only a few brushes in the universe, and when one is abandoned, the other rises. In the past few months, I have heard that those seeking Ruosou's calligraphy and painting have been coming one after another. This old man's beard and hair are white, but his spirit is outstanding. Every day, he walks with a cane according to the time, strolling through the market. Regardless of whether people know him or not, they all point and say, "This is probably a celestial being." I have admired the gentleman for a long time and use these few words to inform those in the world who read Ruosou's calligraphy and painting.</p>
<h3>Examination of Hair Cutting</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yu</p>
<p>Now men and women in our country have all cut their hair. However, the custom of cutting hair did not begin today. The "Historical Records: Wu Family" states that Taibo and Yuzhong fled to the Jingman area and cut their hair and tattooed their bodies. This was the custom of the Jingman before the Zhou Dynasty. In the "Chu Ci: Nine Chapters," it says, "Jie Yu shaved his head and Sanghuo walked naked." This means that in the Spring and Autumn period, the Jing customs still had hair cutting. Also, the "Tang Shu: Biographies of the Four Barbarians" states that the people of the Qiuci country cut their hair to the same length as their necks. This means that in the Tang Dynasty, the customs of the Qiuci also included hair cutting for both men and women. Furthermore, the Han law had the punishment of "kunqian," which means cutting the hair short and then clamping it. If the hair was completely shaved like Buddhist monks today, then there would be no need to clamp it. (Note: According to "Zhou Li: Qiu Guan," "kun" means to make them guard the accumulated wealth. Those of the royal family who are not castrated have their heads shaved. This means that the punishment of shaving the head already existed in the Zhou Dynasty.) Also, the "Book of Songs: Yong Feng" says, "bu xie 髲 ye." A commentary says, "髲 is also called 髲." Also, "Zhou Li: Zhui Shi, Supplementary Compilation" notes that the hair is listed to make it. Its remaining image is like the current fake chignon, which is called a fake bun in the Sanfu area. According to 髲 and fake buns, they must be made of hair. If there is no hair cutting, where would the raw materials for 髲 and fake buns come from? From this, we can see that the custom of hair cutting actually existed in ancient times, but it was not as widespread throughout the country as it is today.</p>
<h3>Visiting Song Park</h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>During the holiday, I visited a friend in Zhabei and we planned to go out for a stroll to a place free from the noise of the city. My friend said, "How about Song Park?" I said, "Great! I have long admired Mr. Yufu as a great figure in the revolution. Let's go right away." So we walked north along Song Park Road for about two miles and reached the entrance, which was made of iron. The surrounding area was fenced with bamboo. Entering the gate, there were three houses with the inscription "Song Garden," which was occupied by the park manager. Further in, there was a majestic statue of Song Gong. The statue was made of stone and depicted him sitting, with his right hand supporting his chin and his left hand holding a stack of newspapers, looking deeply worried. The statue was supported by a square pillar with the words "Yufu Zi" written on the front in seal script by Zhang Binglin, with each character being a foot in diameter. There was an inscription on the side of the pillar written by Yu Youren and inscribed by Kang Douzhong. The text read: "The world mourns Mr. Song's death, the world knows Mr. Song's actions. What else can I record with a straight pen? A straight pen is punished by men, a curved pen is punished by heaven. Alas, the tears of the nine springs, the blood of the world, the pen of an old friend, the iron of the enemy, and the emptiness of the mountains, are expected of good historians to engrave on their hearts and testify to heaven and earth." The base of the pillar was a four-layered stone foundation surrounded by an iron railing, facing a crescent-shaped moon pond, along which short trees were planted, reaching the height of a person's shoulder. Forty paces behind the statue was Gong's tomb, a stone altar five feet high and thirty paces wide and twenty paces deep, surrounded by a stone railing. The tomb was shaped like a sphere, with a round top and a stone 口 with a snake in its mouth, probably with some implied meaning. The tombstone in front of the tomb was inscribed by Yu Youren and read: "Alas, the tomb of Mr. Song Jiaoren." Next to it were two stone benches. Around the altar were evergreen and cypress trees. Behind the altar was a small mound, and behind the mound were old trees that stood like walls. Eighty paces further was the tomb of Gong's wife, Madam Fang. The statue and tomb were both simple and unadorned. The entire garden covered more than ten acres, and there was still plenty of open space besides the cemetery, which was used as a vegetable garden. I climbed onto the altar and looked around. The branches of the trees were all bare, and no flowers bloomed. Only the evergreen and cypress trees stood facing each other, making me feel desolate and lonely, as if I were in an empty mountain valley. I knew that Gong's accumulated suffering had long permeated people's hearts, and there was no need to worry about the winter air not being exhausted. As I was about to leave, the park manager, Mr. Zhu, told me that Gong's son, Zhendu, was a minor official in the Supervisory Yuan and his annual income was only enough to support himself, so the garden was barren and could not be managed. He asked the government for funds but was not granted permission. He also said that when the news of Gong's death reached Beijing, Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai) heard it and said to his attendants, "Now I can finally sleep peacefully." He also said that when Gong was dying, he only spoke of national affairs and nothing else. He sobbed as he spoke. I said goodbye and returned, and wrote this account.</p>
<h3>Women's Pastimes</h3>
<p>— He Li</p>
<p>The saying that men treat women as toys seems to have become outdated, while the saying that women treat men as a pastime seems to be somewhat fashionable. This is probably an example of the principle of extremes meeting. In short, whether men treat women as toys or women treat men as a pastime, one side must suffer greatly. This is an unchanging truth. Since I watched the premiere of the film "Women's Pastimes" at the Paris Theater, I have added endless emotions out of thin air. The plot of the film is about a skilled coachman who, unfortunately, became a pastime for a female socialite, which led to various tragedies. His beloved son froze to death in the snow while chasing after his father, and his beloved wife retreated to a monastery out of extreme hatred, while the socialite had long forgotten his shadow. What a tragic thing! The film is produced by Ou Ou and has full sound. Not only are the various songs and dances unique, but the profound expressions are enough to constantly shake the audience's heartstrings. This is indeed a masterpiece among modern films. I heard that Paris is scheduled to premiere it this Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Celebrating the King of Flowers in the Depths of Apricot Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Mei Lang</p>
<p>The Mingxing Company's production of China's first sound film, "Singing Girl Red Peony," has been completed after nearly half a year of twists and turns. The Mingxing Company was overjoyed and held a grand banquet at the Xinghua Lou Restaurant the other day to celebrate its success. The clinking of glasses and the exchange of toasts created a lively atmosphere. A brief account is given below to mark this joyous occasion.</p>
<p>▲A Glimpse of the Venue: The banquet was held on the top floor of the Xinghua Lou Restaurant. A small stage for performances and entertainment was set up in the center. The room was decorated with colorful silk and scattered paper flowers. A huge banner with the words "Celebrating the Success of China's First Sound Film, Singing Girl Red Peony" was hung above. The surrounding pillars were filled with green bamboo adorned with silver stars, creating a dazzling and extremely luxurious atmosphere.</p>
<p>▲All the Stars Gathered: There were more than two hundred people attending the banquet that day, with guests from all walks of life and employees and actors from the company accounting for half each. All the male and female stars arrived early to take on the role of hosts. The female stars, such as Xia Peizhen, Xuan Jinglin, Zhao Jingxia, Gao Qianping, and Yan Yuexian, were all dressed in beautiful and new costumes, vying for attention and attracting the most attention from the entire venue. Although there were many guests at the banquet, most of them had never met in person, but they were all familiar acquaintances through their appearances on the silver screen. Ms. Hu Die arrived late, wearing a red new outfit, tall and graceful, with a charming demeanor. The peony is the king of flowers, and her talent and artistry are enough to lead the group of flowers. The name "Red Peony" truly matches her name and reality.</p>
<p>▲Distinguished Guests: The guests who arrived included members of the Film Censorship Committee, reporters from various major newspapers, famous lawyers in Shanghai, domestic and foreign film distributors, representatives from Chinese and Western theaters, and members of the Mingxing Opera Troupe. They crowded into the room, making it a truly grand occasion.</p>
<p>▲Witty Remarks from Guests and Hosts: After several rounds of drinks, the chairman, Zhang Shichuan, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Zhou Jianyun, successively stood up to thank the guests and report on the production process of "Singing Girl Red Peony." Mr. Zheng disassembled the characters "Gong" (功, success) and "He" (賀, celebration) to encourage his colleagues, saying that the character "Gong" comes from "Gong" (工, work) and "Li" (力, effort), which shows that the success of everything must come from hard work. The character "He" is also the result of "Li" (effort), which can win everyone's "Kou" (口, mouth) to celebrate. His words were sincere and witty. During the program, Mr. Hong Shen originally planned to give a speech in Western languages, but because there were only two foreign guests, he temporarily changed to using Mandarin. Therefore, Mr. Yan Duhe said in his speech that Mr. Hong's foreign sound film had suddenly been changed to a Chinese sound film, which was extremely welcome. However, I only brought a "Kou" (mouth) to participate in today's celebration and have a good meal, and I have no "Li" (ability) to assist in any way. I have many words of praise for "Singing Girl Red Peony." His words were sharp and directly opposed Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu. Next, Mr. Zhou Shoujuan, who was suffering from a cold and hoarse voice, only gave a few words and then stopped because the sound and electricity machine was damaged. Some guests urged Ms. Hu Die to give a speech, and after being repeatedly urged by Zhang Shichuan and Hong Shen, she finally stood up gracefully and spoke in a delicate voice with a singing flavor: "I can't give a speech. Thank you for not abandoning me and asking me to say a few words, but where should I start? So please let Mr. Hong Shen represent me." Her few words were very appropriate. At this point, Mr. Hong could only say "Forget it, forget it" to say goodbye to the guests. Everyone present laughed.</p>
<p>▲Celebratory Afterthoughts: The banquet ended at ten o'clock, and a comic skit was performed on stage to add to the guests' enjoyment. At this time, Mr. Zhou Jianyun was heard saying that the celebratory banquet and drama performance for "Singing Girl Red Peony" were originally scheduled to be held simultaneously at the Mingxing Company on the 15th of this month. However, due to being busy with editing the "Singing Girl Red Peony" publications, the preparations were not enough, so the banquet was brought forward to today. The Mingxing Opera Troupe's performance will be postponed to next Sunday (22nd). The programs include "Visiting the Mother" by Mr. Zhou and Ying Yunwen, "Selling the Horse" by Zheng Zhengqiu, "Yutang Spring" by Hu Die, "Baolian Lantern" by Xuan Jinglin and Wang Yushu, "Jia Meng Guan" by Dong Tianya, "Baishui Han" by Xu Xinfu, and "Little Cowherd" by Zheng Xiaoqiu and Gu Meijun, with more than a dozen programs in total. It is expected that the scene on Dumei Road will be bustling with activity at that time.</p>
<p>▲Short News: Yesterday, I met with Mr. Yuan Ludeng, who talked about the recent situation of the various ticket offices. According to him, the Shenshang Club is scheduled to rehearse "The Great Creek Imperial Village" and "The Complete Red Cliff Battle" on the 21st of this month. The actors have recently been practicing. In "Creek Imperial Village," Dong Zhengqing plays Chu Biao, Zhang Shuping plays Hua Delei, Lei Tu Kaizheng and his son Jihong play Zhang Zongyao, and Xu Sheng plays the martial arts roles. The small tunes sung by the various martial arts actors have been solicited from the female community. In "Red Cliff Battle," Li Baishui plays Kongming, Guo Xiuzhi plays Lu Su, Fang Cen plays Zhou Yu, and Lei Tu Kaizheng cross-dresses as Zhang Fei. Please Jiang Bogong to play his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Jiang Gan. Tickets are priced at half a yuan each and are purchased by members and distributed to relatives and friends.

<h3>Rambling in Europe (4)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>After changing trains at Torino, Italy, Junli and I occupied a compartment. I slept soundly. In the middle of the night, someone knocked on the door to check passports. I knew that the train had entered French territory. The French were stricter in checking incoming passengers. A fellow Italian in the neighboring compartment was carrying too many cigarettes and had to pay taxes. However, they were very polite to us Orientals. The inspectors paid the most attention to cigarettes and alcohol. They did not ask about carrying firearms or any propaganda books. Is a country with laws afraid of you killing people? Cigarettes and alcohol are either state monopolies or have extremely heavy taxes, so they are checked very carefully. This is the case not only in France but also in all European countries. After checking our luggage and passports, we packed up our luggage. The sun had not yet risen when we arrived at Lyon station. The French clergyman in the same carriage came to call us and had the station porters move our luggage downstairs and take it directly to our exit. After saying goodbye, we left the station, not knowing where to go. The porter who carried the luggage helped us find a hotel car. We had no choice but to follow his instructions. The car made a turn and we were already at a hotel, Hotel d'Angleterre. The hotel sign said "English Hotel," but it was actually run by French people. The room was beautifully decorated and the price was cheap. I had learned a lesson while traveling in Europe: when staying in a hotel, look for a large hotel with many rooms because room reservations and payment of room fees are managed separately in large hotels, and there are no other small charges. If you stay in a small hotel, there are many other small charges, and the cost is higher than in a large hotel. This is especially important when traveling in Italy. After resting briefly in the hotel lobby, we went out to explore. In front of the hotel was a public square near the station. In the square, there were two bronze statues standing tall. The leaves on the surrounding trees were tender green after the rain. The sudden appearance of the sun in the morning made us feel comfortable. We strolled along the park and found a cafe for breakfast. We decided to visit an old friend at the Franco-Chinese University in Lyon first. Having just arrived in Lyon, we were not familiar with the roads, so we bought a guidebook and followed it. We also asked several passersby and learned that the Franco-Chinese University was on a mountaintop. We crossed a small iron bridge and climbed a rugged dirt mountain. The hillside was uneven and we walked for a full fifteen minutes before we found the Franco-Chinese University. The so-called Franco-Chinese University was just a simple building in a desolate place. Inside, there were only dormitories and no schools. The dormitories were all occupied by Chinese students who were studying at various universities in Lyon. It was still early, and the dormitory door had not yet opened. An old French man with a red nose ran out. We asked him about Hualin, but he seemed not to know Chinese names. He turned around and said, "Find it yourself." He then took out a piece of white cardboard and wrote in French. The first name in the W row of letters was Walin. I knew that Hualin lived in room 42. I went in, knocked on the door, and a man wearing a French student hat with gray hair opened the door. After meeting, we talked about his life in Rome. There were many Chinese students in Lyon because the cost of living there was cheaper than in Paris, and it was also suitable for studying hard.</p>

Because of the large Indian exchange report, after the turn of Luan, it was 78 taels, but the sellers were quite strong. 元茂永順利昌升永 and others went out and the Indian exchange rate continued to rise by 8 Anna, so there were many people downstream of 78 taels.

<h3>Lixi Market Remains Robust</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's market conditions were not much different from usual, but the lixi price remained strong in the afternoon and the situation has not been replaced. According to general speculation, it is feared that it will be difficult to stand for a long time, and the trend of the silver root is always flat, with no good signs to record.</p>

<h3>Desolate News of the Future Ocean Trade</h3>
<p>The financial community, at the request of the silk cocoon merchants in the past, opened up the forward ocean lixi price in order to avoid the narrowness of the deadline, commonly known as the three-bottom forward ocean. Since the year before, the reason for doing forward ocean has contained speculation, and the authorities have prevented accidents and tried to stop it. Therefore, in recent years, this news has rarely been heard, but in the past two years, although there has been little news in the Ming market, dark market transactions are still very numerous. However, the start of the transaction is always after the market opens and makes the market. It is probably between the second and early stages of the old calendar, but the current opening period has reached its end, and there is no news in the market. All the people in the bureau say that this year, they are unwilling to engage in advance planning because of the poor quality of the silk cocoon news last year, and the price of lixi in the forward ocean trade is often huge. If the profits are not predictable, it is better to buy them temporarily when there is no guarantee of dumping. If that is the case, the success of this year's three-bottom forward ocean news is desolate.</p>
<p>The securities and bonds have rebounded by several corners, and the trend is still stagnant. The turnover is more than 5 million yuan. Yesterday, the spot trading of public bonds continued to be rare, and only 8,000 yuan of various bonds were opened. The futures market was slightly better than last weekend. The turnover of the front and rear markets was 2.56 million yuan, totaling 5,185,000 yuan. The prices of various bonds were consistently tired compared to the previous day, but the trend remained peaceful. The prices of various bonds throughout the day fluctuated by more than two or three corners, which was two or three corners less than last weekend and five or six corners less.</p>
<p>The difference between the period and the present before the opening and closing is as follows, compared with the previous day's turnover of several hundred and sixty-three, six hundred and ninety-four zero six hundred and ninety zero five fell zero seventy-five one one five zero zero zero zero whole six four six hundred and ninety-seven zero six hundred and ninety-seven zero fell zero three zero one seven zero zero zero zero seven years three hundred and eighty-two seven zero fell zero two zero five zero zero zero zero customs duty three hundred and sixty-one nine zero six hundred and eighteen five fell zero one five four zero zero zero zero zero customs duty four hundred and sixty zero two zero six hundred and two zero no movement five five zero zero zero edited and deleted now six hundred and thirty one zero fell zero three zero three zero zero zero edited and deleted small now six hundred and eighteen zero six hundred and eighteen zero fell zero two zero edited and deleted three six hundred and thirty-four zero six hundred and thirty-two five fell zero two five three zero zero zero zero edited and deleted four six hundred and twenty-four zero six hundred and twenty-one zero fell zero three zero two four five zero zero zero cut down three seven hundred and sixty-six zero seven hundred and sixty-four zero fell zero three five five one zero zero zero cut down four seven hundred and seventy-two zero seven hundred and seventy zero fell zero three five eight five five zero zero zero nine hundred and sixty-three one hundred and twenty-three zero two zero three five fell zero zero five one hundred and sixty zero zero zero nine hundred and sixty-four two zero four five one zero four five no movement five zero zero zero zero one hundred and nineteen rolls three hundred and seventy-one zero zero no movement one two zero zero one hundred and nineteen open now six hundred and eighty-eight zero fell zero two zero one zero zero zero one hundred and nineteen customs duty three hundred and seventy-nine four zero seven hundred and ninety-one zero fell zero two five one hundred and sixty-five zero zero zero one hundred and nineteen customs duty four seven hundred and seventy-eight zero seven hundred and seventy-five zero fell zero four zero two hundred and sixty zero zero zero one hundred and nineteen good three hundred and eighty zero one zero seven hundred and ninety-eight zero fell zero six zero four hundred and seventy-five zero zero zero one hundred and nineteen good four seven hundred and eighty-six zero seven hundred and eighty-four zero fell zero six zero three hundred and twenty-five zero zero zero two hundred and twenty rolls three hundred and seventy-six zero seven hundred and seventy zero fell zero two five five hundred and ninety zero zero zero two hundred and twenty rolls four seven hundred and fifty-nine zero seven hundred and ninety-eight five fell zero two five six hundred and fifty-five zero zero zero one hundred and nineteen customs duty now seven hundred and twenty-five zero fell one hundred zero two hundred and ninety zero zero financial three three hundred and ninety-nine five no movement two hundred zero zero zero zero</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Weak in the Morning and Rebounding in the Afternoon The trend is still flat. Because the manufacturers are tough and have no intention of letting go, a certain giant still holds the doctrine of buying. The March issue is especially important. However, most retail households tend to sell because of the poor actual sales and the rising silver price. Therefore, both the long and short sides are in a state of holding back. However, the large households with real strength in the current total number are in the long position. At the lowest point, the number of sellers has been reduced, and the market has been up. The Shenxin factory has sold 150 pieces of 20-count Ren Zhongsha at a price of 111 yuan per East Exchange Day. The tax and freight are outside. The domestic sales of domestic yarn are gradually improving, and the peak season is in spring, so the buyer is tightening and not letting go.</p>
<p>After the Human Standard, the active household of the Jin Dynasty After the Human Standard, the market opened with the fatigue of foreign cotton and the great rise of silver price. The market atmosphere was quite weak. Each of the two and three plates still declined. It was heard that the Yunnan gang had raw yarn transactions, which slightly boosted people's hearts. As a result, each declined by two cents and five cents to one tael and six cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was a hope for the real needs, and the large households purchased each month, which rebounded. As a result, each rose by one tael, two, five, six, eight cents. The transaction was 36,750 packages. It was found that the sale of Dafu was 1,250 packages, Hengchang was 1,500 packages, Yichang was 1,500 packages, Changfeng was 1,600 packages, Meiji was 850 packages, and Tianlong was 600 packages.

Shenxin sold 110 packages of 20-count Ren Zhong, which was 111 yuan for each package.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Tired and Spiritless</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly tired, mainly because the overseas cotton market is soft, the silver price is rising, and the exchange rate is changing. Therefore, people's hearts are relatively weak, and the Japanese merchants' attitude is flat, and the trend is gradually softening. However, in recent months, because of the thin bottom goods, the buyer's thoughts are still firm, and those who throw empty are not afraid to throw them as much as possible because they see that the world situation is not good. However, the long-term market atmosphere is increasingly tired. Recently, the cotton market is actually weaker than the yarn market.</p>
<p>The Han Standard is Weakened The Han Standard market opened with the poor performance of US and Indian cotton, and the market atmosphere was very singing. The selling atmosphere was very strong, and each fell by six, seven, eight, and nine cents. In the afternoon, the yarn market news was good, and it rose slightly by three or four cents. It is found that the total transaction volume in the whole day is 82,300 dan.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Situation Reverses and Rises</h3>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, the ships of all gangs arrived at the port in two or thirty shifts, and only the self-made gang and the water vendor gang slightly sold. However, the selling hand of the Jing Sales Association had some disputes with the rice shops of the Rice Shop Association, and both sides had no transactions and did not open the bucket. Therefore, the total transaction volume in the whole day was greatly reduced. However, this matter was caused by misunderstandings between all parties and can be resolved in the near future. The white sheep Xianbai yuan was consistently firm and made few openings. Because the goods of the South Road were thin, the number of buckets was still tight by one corner.</p>
<p>Hu South Yesterday, the source of the river was very scarce, and the street went to the very pleasant. The white japonica rice of Changxi Sutonggang all rose at the corner price, while the rising price of Xianguangshang also increased by several points, and the situation was extremely tight. The purchase intention was quite good. The source of the thin early rice of the South Road was dry, and the customer sales activities saw an increase of one, two or three corners. The sales of Yang Du Jian were light and the market was slightly firm, while Bian Yuan Yin Hua was still stagnant.</p>
<h3>Beiyang Gang Continues to Run Keyuan</h3>
<p>The price has been rising step by step. Yesterday, the market situation of Keyuan was still stagnant, but it was slightly more active than the previous day. Because there were 200 packages of Nanjing machine rice going to this street, and the Jiangxi rice market had little stock, the owners were still waiting and watching. However, there were still inquiries about Keyuan from the original customers, and the market was becoming more and more prosperous due to the lack of stock. Yesterday, the Beiyang Gang ran 100 packages of Jiangxi Jiyuan, and the price was as high as 14.5 yuan. In terms of goods, it was even more expensive than the previous opening.</p>
<h3>Remote Monthly Flour Factory Throws Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning and afternoon, and the market for each month was quoted at a price of 234 corners less than the foreign wheat. The standard also followed the trend, so when the market opened, people's hearts were no longer stable, and the closing price of the previous weekend was already lower. Because of the continuous release of the factory, the market trend went down. When the market opened in the afternoon, the environment was even worse. The exchange rate increased, and the foreign companies who dumped foreign wheat came one after another. The quoted price was only three taels, nine cents and six or seven points, and the market atmosphere seemed to be broken because of the step-by-step blow from foreign countries, and there was no way to save it. The long-term was even more prosperous because of the factory throwing, and the decline was even more uncontrollable. For example, the lowest price in August was two taels and seven cents and a half, which was the lowest record in the past two or three years. The transaction volume reached more than 1.6 million. It is not surprising that the opportunity to order foreign wheat is not over and the decline has entered two taels. As a result, the current month fell two cents compared to the previous weekend, May fell three and a half cents, June fell four and a half cents, July fell four cents and two cents and a half, and August fell four and a half cents.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Consistently Plummets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market trend of each month in the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon was consistently plummeting. The conclusion is that the transformation of the international image completely affects China. Yesterday, with the quoted price of foreign wheat also small, the price of gold also returned to short, with these two heavy oppression, the thoughts of the people outside the industry are difficult to revive again. The empty head of the exchange is purely the surplus of foreign countries. Not only the factories are like this, but the industry is also three or four tenths. Moreover, there are not a few people who wait for the opportunity to move. Therefore, at this point, the outsiders can no longer hold back and can only be oppressed and unable to resist. If the subsequent steps see two cents, the new record of 78 cents may not be difficult to see. As a result, the current month fell six cents compared to the previous weekend, May fell nine cents, June fell one dollar, July fell nine cents, August fell eight cents, and the current wheat market has been silent for a long time. Yesterday, the high post wheat was opened at 300 packages, and the price was as low as three taels, four cents and seven points.</p>
<h3>Standard Soybean Plummets Six or Seven Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures bean was soft. The market opened in the morning because the customer gang had a light stomach and the Jin Dynasty news fell, and people's hearts were already depressed. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the Dalian production telegram fell and the market trend suddenly turned down. The current price of the combined declaration was only four taels and six cents, so the market selling atmosphere was extremely strong. The closing price was reversed due to the floating space to compensate for the result. The March and April contracts fell by six cents, and the May and June contracts fell by seven cents.</p>
<p>The market price of yellow peach meat in the north and south has been reversed. The office price in the Han Dynasty was the smallest, and it once reached 12 taels. In recent days, the market price has gradually rebounded due to the small number of arrivals. According to yesterday's Han Dynasty news, it has risen to 39 taels outside, which is more than 8 taels higher than the lowest price before and after. Therefore, the Shen market's market price is also standing upright. Yesterday, the sale price was 42 taels, and there was a slight transaction. In terms of the Han price, it is also difficult to match the Tianjin market price, which is even farther away. For example, Shang Zhongzhuang also needs more than 100 yuan, so the feet are quite stable.</p>
<p>The sales of silk and tea eyebrows and pearl tea are slightly smooth. Yesterday, the Moroccan market on the road of the Tuozhuang and the two roads of the Zhenmei Pearl Tea had telephone demand, and the white head market also slightly entered the market. The market situation was not lonely. However, at this time, people's hearts were so weak that the tea price still could not be increased. The total number of Zhenmei needle eyebrow defects and tribute beads sold in the city was more than 400 boxes, and the selling price was two or three taels lower than before.</p>
<h3>Huichang Huasi Pulls The Price is Not High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign village silk market was still difficult to reach. Because the foreign exchange continued to rise, the sea electricity exchange price had already increased, but the price was not high due to the exchange rate relationship. The turnover of Hu Bai factory and other factories was difficult to be smooth. Only Qianli and other companies went to Hu Bai factory to trade 60 packages of Kechang, etc. The price was still flat.</p>
<h3>Chinese Silk Can Be Directly Shipped to India</h3>
<p>There are more than 200 pieces of tomorrow's World Class postal ship bound for India. The political problem has been resolved. The order prohibiting the import of foreign goods has also been lifted. The Sino-Indian trade has gradually returned to its original state. The Chinese silk sales, which have been stagnating for a long time, have become more active. Both yellow and white silk can be directly shipped to India. The World Class postal ship tomorrow, plus the Cade export Samsung and other companies, have 280 pieces of yellow and white silk loaded for India.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Western-style Suit Lining, Feather Yarn Prices Quite Strong</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of woolen fabrics have been quite active, with buyers from various regions showing good interest. Both wholesale and retail transactions are extremely brisk. Yesterday, tailors specializing in Western-style suits were all in need of lining feather yarn. Plain, twill, and patterned varieties all saw transactions. White, gray, and light yellow-gray plain feather yarn were particularly sought after. De Ji sold it for 1.8 taels of silver, Hao Hua for 1.7 taels, and Ning Feng Hong Sheng for 1.65 taels. De Ji's twill feather yarn sold for 1.75 taels, and Ning Feng's for 1.525 taels.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: Four thousand eight hundred bags of white rice arrived from Hunan; six hundred pieces of ore arrived from England; one thousand one hundred pieces of European paper arrived; one thousand four hundred pieces of piece goods were shipped to Jiangnan; nine hundred pieces of German dyes arrived; five hundred and eighty cases of cigarettes were shipped to the South Sea Islands; five hundred and twenty barrels of tobacco arrived from America; one thousand six hundred tons of European steel arrived. More than five thousand bags of Shen Ri grain were imported yesterday, and one thousand three hundred pieces of Japanese wire arrived.</p>

<h3>Recovering Sovereignty over Ship Inspection</h3>
<p>Five Chinese staff members have been transferred from the Customs to the Navigation Administration Bureau and have already registered. For decades, the right to inspect ships has been held by foreigners, and the loss of sovereignty has never been recovered, being part of an unequal treaty. In recent years, there have been increasing calls to reclaim navigation rights. Shanghai Chinese shipping companies believe that the issue of ship inspection is of paramount importance to the ships themselves and their business, and are determined to reclaim autonomy. Last year, after several meetings in Shanghai's shipping circles, they requested the Jianghai Customs to allow the various shipping bureaus to hire Chinese staff to inspect ships, but this was rejected by the Customs. Later, it was heard that the contract of Mr. Mai, the British ship inspector of the Jianghai Customs, was about to expire. The shipping companies further petitioned the Ministry, advocating that all ship inspectors in the national customs system be Chinese, in order to recover sovereignty in the national interest. This request had been made for a long time, and only recently did the Ministry issue an order stating that the Customs had agreed to employ as many Chinese staff as possible as ship inspectors, and ordered the shipping companies to promptly investigate and report on qualified personnel to the Ministry for potential appointment. The sovereignty lost for decades can thus begin to be recovered. This must be recorded in detail.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies' Petition: Shanghai shipping companies collectively petitioned the Ministry, saying in the petition to the General Commissioner of Customs to order all customs offices nationwide to change to employing Chinese citizens as ship inspectors to protect sovereignty and the national system. The petition stated that the safety of ships is the primary concern for navigation, and therefore the solidity of the ship's construction and the perfection of its equipment are of fundamental importance and can only be determined through proper inspection and professional assessment. Therefore, all countries in the East and West are very cautious in the selection of ship inspectors and employ qualified personnel to ensure safety and protect sovereignty. China's shipping industry is still in its infancy, and specialized personnel have mostly been borrowed from foreign countries due to the lack of qualified personnel, making immediate replacement difficult. However, in the past ten years, there has been no shortage of personnel who have graduated from various specialized fields of transportation and machinery, have diplomas and degrees, possess qualifications and experience, and are recognized by various advanced countries. Employing them as ship inspectors at various customs offices is more than sufficient. The time has come to restore sovereignty. The shipping companies, in view of this, have prepared a document petitioning the Ministry to order the General Commissioner of Customs to instruct all customs offices that in the future, whenever a current foreign ship inspector's service period expires, or they resign voluntarily, or leave office for some reason, their vacancy should be filled by qualified Chinese citizens until all positions are filled by Chinese citizens, in order to protect sovereignty and the national system. (The rest is omitted)</p>
<p>Ministry's Instructions: The Ministry of Communications issued instructions, stating briefly that the inspection of ships is very important for navigation safety. The Ministry is currently preparing to establish a Navigation Administration Bureau, which will directly manage ship inspection. As for the appointment of ship inspectors, the Ministry has already ordered the Customs to investigate. According to a report from the General Commissioner of Customs on February 13, the Jianghai Customs Supervisor has been ordered to investigate as much as possible Chinese staff with ship inspection experience for potential employment. The various shipping companies should promptly investigate and report such experienced personnel to the Ministry for registration and preparation for recruitment.</p>
<p>Specialist Registration: Last year, when Shanghai shipping companies strived to recover sovereignty over ship inspection, the Nan Hua, San Bei, and other shipping bureaus in the city reported five Chinese staff members with ship inspection qualifications and academic degrees to the Ministry for registration. Subsequently, the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications formulated regulations on the qualifications of ship inspectors and prepared certificates for specialized personnel to submit and receive. Now, the Ministry has issued instructions to the companies, stating that the five personnel previously recommended, Liu Fupei, Li Yuncheng, Huang Shaosan, Cao Shoumi, and Yu Jianzhen, have been registered and certified by the Navigation Administration Department, and they are informed that the Ministry has decided to recover sovereignty over ship inspection and will implement it as soon as the Navigation Administration Bureau is established.</p>
<p>Money Trade Association</p>
<h3>Request to Establish a Money Shop Law</h3>
<p>A petition to various government agencies, outlining difficulties: The Shanghai Money Trade Association believes that the inclusion of the money trade in the bank law by the Legislative Yuan makes its implementation extremely difficult. A meeting was held and a resolution was passed to petition the Central Political Conference, the National Government Chairman Chiang, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry to request the separate enactment of a Money Shop Law. The original petition is recorded below: "A petition stating that money trade laws and regulations are of vital importance, but their inclusion in other laws is causing many obstacles. We humbly present the actual situation and earnestly request your review. News reports state that Article 1 of the Banking Law passed by the Legislative Yuan states that anyone engaged in one of the following businesses is a bank: 1. Accepting deposits and making loans; 2. Discounting bills; 3. Remittance or advance. Anyone engaged in one of the above businesses without calling themselves a bank will be treated as a bank, etc. If money shops are subordinate to the Banking Law and follow the various articles, many obstacles will arise and it will be difficult to comply. We respectfully present this to your Excellency. The money trade primarily relies on credit for lending. From major cities to remote towns and villages in our country, all businesses rely on credit for lending to assist in their operations. If restrictions are imposed, as stipulated by the Banking Law, then on the one hand, capital will be prone to stagnation, and on the other hand, all industries will lose their turnover opportunities, and the decline of industry and commerce will be immediately apparent. This is obstacle one, making it difficult to implement. Money trade organizations are all unlimited liability companies. Since shareholders bear significant responsibilities, if they are now required to submit proof of property to government agencies, a sense of fear will arise, and the channels for investing in business will narrow, inevitably leading to capital depletion and increased hardship for the people. This is obstacle two, making it difficult to implement. Our country is vast and rich in resources. The organization of various industries may be as joint medical stores or companies, adapting to local conditions to facilitate development. If the financial industry is limited to company organizations, then the good customs that have been followed for hundreds of years will be changed, inevitably causing disturbances. This is obstacle three, making it difficult to implement. The above are just some of the major points. The safety of society and the prosperity of the people depend on this. This is not only about the money trade. We have always admired your Excellency's foresight and consideration for both major and minor matters. All industries have been protected, and the money trade is responsible for financing capital and holding the key to the rise and fall of all industries. Moving one hair can affect the whole body. Securing the money trade means securing all industries. We dare to present the facts and humbly request your review. Please grant a separate Money Shop Law to facilitate implementation and compliance. We cannot express our urgency enough. We respectfully submit."</p>

<p>Major Reforms</p>
<h3>Railway Timetables</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Route</h3>
<p>(A) Special Matters (1) The timings of trains 31 and 32, the special through express trains, are convenient for passengers travelling to and from Shanghai and Hangzhou. However, due to train handover and departure times, it is proposed to revise them as follows: Train 31 will be delayed by five minutes, departing from the Zhakou station at 9:30; train 32 will be delayed by ten minutes, departing from Shanghai North at 18:00. As trains 31 and 32 utilize the carriages of trains 1 and 2 on the Beijing-Shanghai line, the original schedule only allows 45 minutes for vehicle transfer and other work, which is deemed too rushed. Therefore, the stopover time at Shanghai North Station also needs to be slightly extended. (2) The original timings for trains 33 and 44, the two special express trains, are considered appropriate. However, due to train handover considerations, it is proposed to advance train 33 by five minutes, departing from the Zhakou station at 17:35, and delay train 44 by ten minutes, departing from Shanghai North at 9:10.</p>
<p>(B) Express Trains (3) The original departure time for train 35, the express train, from the Zhakou station is considered too early and inconvenient for passengers. It is proposed to delay it by 25 minutes, departing at 7:10. Also, as there are few passengers at the Xuchun and Zhouwangmiao stations, stops will be omitted at these two stations to save time. (4) As train 7 on the Beijing-Shanghai line is scheduled to depart at 7:00, the departure time for train 16 from Shanghai North had to be delayed by ten minutes to 7:10. Also, as there are few passengers at the Xuhui, Meilong, Xinqiao, Mingxing, and Shihudang stations, stops will be omitted at these five stations to save time. The Machinery Department believes that the speed of the above two trains must be reduced, so the travel time will be slightly extended. (5) As the departure times for trains 37 and 38, the express trains, are too late, causing inconvenience to passengers, train 37 will be advanced, departing at 13:40. However, due to vehicle utilization, train 38 can only be advanced to depart at 15:00.</p>
<p>(C) Slow Trains (6) The Machinery Department believes that the speed of trains 39 and 40, the slow trains, must be reduced, so the travel times will be extended. Train 29 will be extended by 33 minutes, and train 40 will be extended by 35 minutes.</p>
<p>(D) Local Trains (7) It is proposed to add one round trip for the local train between Xinlong and Shanghai South, as there is a single locomotive travelling to and from that location, which can be used to tow passenger cars for the convenience of passengers. (8) As the local train on the Jiangshu section needs to connect with various trains on the main line, its timing will also be slightly changed. As there are few passengers on this section, it is proposed to reduce two round trips on the Gonghang section. (9) The timetable for the Ning Cao section passenger train is considered appropriate and will not be changed.</p>
<p>(E) Freight Trains (10) The departure time for the Shanghai-Hangzhou freight train 401 is too late. As it has to yield to passenger trains along the way, it often cannot arrive in Shanghai at the scheduled time, and the fresh goods on board cannot be unloaded and sold in time. It is proposed to advance it by one hour and forty minutes, departing from the Zhakou station at 8:40, for the convenience of the freight merchants. The timings for the remaining freight trains, 402 to 406, will be slightly changed due to train handover considerations.</p>
<p>Tomorrow</p>
<h3>Beiping People's Revolution Commemoration</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department will hold a commemorative assembly. Tomorrow (the 18th) is the 3/18 Beiping People's Revolution Commemoration. Five years ago, the people of North China, feeling the relentless attacks of imperialists and the weakness and incompetence of the warlord government, gathered the people of Beiping at Tiananmen Square to hold a National Assembly, urging the government to work hard to resist and to serve as the government's diplomatic backing. Who knew that the Duan government was fundamentally a tool for imperialists to invade China? When the people went to the Executive Yuan to petition, they were shot at, resulting in over a hundred deaths and injuries. The 3/18 Commemoration, stained with blood and flesh, is something that the revolutionary people of the whole country can never forget, and the determination to overthrow the warlords and imperialists has become more widespread among the people of the whole country. Now that the warlord government has been overthrown, but recalling the suffering and struggle of the people under the oppression of the collusion between warlords and imperialists is truly heartbreaking and inspiring. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department has decided to convene a commemorative assembly for all walks of life at 9:00 AM tomorrow in the Municipal Party Department on the third floor. All organs, groups, and schools in the city should send four representatives to participate. The Department's assembly agenda is recorded below.</p>
<p>Assembly Order: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the Party song; (3) Pay the highest respects to the Party and National flags and the portrait of the Premier; (4) The chair respectfully reads the Premier's will; (5) Silence; (6) Six-seat report; (7) Speech; (8) Shout slogans; (9) Dismissal.</p>
<p>Assembly Staff: Chair: Yang Qingyuan; Recorder: Zhou Hanmei; Master of Ceremonies: Xu Yefu; Reception: Li Zheng, Cai Bubai, Tao Shuyuan; Staff: Cao Huaqiu, Yang Shaozhi, Chen Ming.</p>
<p>Assembly Slogans: (1) The spirit of the martyrs never dies; (2) Continue the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs; (3) Continue the sacrificing spirit of the martyrs; (4) Eliminate the remnants of the warlords; (5) Overthrow imperialism; (6) Vigorously implement revolutionary diplomacy; (7) Abolish all unequal treaties; (8) Realize the Premier's teachings; (9) Follow the Three Principles of the People; (10) Support the National Government; (11) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (12) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>People's Assembly</p>
<h3>Election Office Urges Preparation of Registers</h3>
<p>Further Extension for Obtaining Registers: The Shanghai Municipal People's Assembly Election Office, in order to urge all groups and schools to quickly prepare various registers, has, starting yesterday, dispatched personnel from the Guidance Group of the office with letters to the groups and schools that have already obtained the registers to collect them, and has sent letters to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to request that they transcribe the groups that have been approved for establishment at any time, and has notified all groups to quickly obtain the registers and report them. The official letter is recorded below: Respectfully, this office has been handling election matters for quite some time, and the deadline for all groups in the city to obtain the registers has been announced and extended to the 15th of this month. It has been found that a significant number of groups have not yet obtained the registers before the deadline. After careful review, the office believes that the reason may be that the reorganization of the groups has not been completed, or that the certificates from the Party and government organs have not been obtained. The situation is understandable. In order to take into account the facts, the deadline is extended by three days to show accommodation. This letter is specially sent to request your association to jointly notify all groups in the city with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Citizen Training Association to quickly obtain the registers and not delay any further. Furthermore, please inform us of the groups that have been issued certificates by your association and bureau at any time so that we can separately send personnel to provide guidance. We hope you will investigate and handle this accordingly.</p>

<p>Today's Agenda: The meeting will begin at 8:00 AM today. (1) Representatives from various provinces will continue to report on cotton production conditions. (2) Sun Yushu will deliver a speech on "The Issue of Promoting Chinese Cotton Seeds and Preserving Purity." The meeting will begin at 1:30 PM.

<p>Banquet the Night Before: The night before, the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation held a banquet at the Daguanlou to entertain the representatives from various provinces and the guests participating in the conference, totaling 88 people. Halfway through the meal, Rong Zongjing stood up and gave a speech, saying in brief that the Federation was very honored to have the representatives present and hoped they would forgive any shortcomings in the arrangements. The current domestic raw cotton production is insufficient, and the coarseness and shortness of the fiber do not meet the needs of the mills. Recently, the mills have been gradually trending towards fine spinning, and the demand for medium cotton has decreased even more. Unimprovable medium cotton such as Shandong American varieties and Tianjin American varieties are not suitable. Long-staple cotton can now be used to spin 32-count and 42-count yarns. The successful results of promoting long-staple cotton in Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Shaanxi, Henan, Zhejiang, and other provinces can be asserted. However, improvement cannot be achieved through short-term discussion to obtain concrete measures. Please explore this issue in detail. The Ministry of Industry's assistance in achieving results would be easy. The mills do not want to use raw materials prone to moisture absorption, but they are forced to purchase them due to the lack of domestic raw cotton. If domestic production is abundant and the number of cotton fields increases, this kind of malpractice can be eliminated without prohibition. Now, we are all in the cotton industry and should stand on the same front. Japanese-owned yarn mills account for nearly half of the national total, and the suffering of Chinese mills is even deeper. It is hoped that we will unite and jointly plan for the development of China's cotton industry. Then, the representatives elected Li Guozhen, the representative from Shaanxi, to respond. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until around 10:00 PM.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Election of Foreign Directors</h3>
<p>Continuous Voting Today: Yesterday was the first day of the election of foreign directors for the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement. Voting began at the Council's Tax Collection Office at 10:00 AM and ended at 3:00 PM. A total of 683 taxpayers went to vote. American lawyer Rogers arrived at the venue earliest to cast the first vote. Afterwards, taxpayers arrived in twos and threes, with the period from 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM being the most crowded, as it coincided with lunch breaks, allowing taxpayers to take advantage of the time to vote. There are a total of ten candidates this year: six British, two American, and two Japanese. With only nine seats available, it is speculated that one of the six British candidates will likely be unsuccessful. It is expected that the American candidates will return to the old practice of having two elected, and both Japanese candidates are also expected to be elected. Voting will continue for another day today until 3:00 PM, after which the ballot boxes will be opened and the votes counted. The results are expected to be revealed around tonight.</p>
<h3>Edward's Lawsuit Against the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Second Court Hearing Held Yesterday, Judgment Reserved: The lawsuit filed by Edward, the dismissed Chief Officer of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, against the Council for compensation for damages, was heard for the second time yesterday afternoon. The International Court, composed of the Belgian Consul-General Van Haute, the British Consul-General Brenan, the Dutch Consul-General Graeffe, the American Consul-General Jenkins, and the Japanese Consul-General Muratsu, convened in the Council's meeting room. The plaintiff, Edward, attended the court with his lawyer, Harris. The defendant was represented by lawyer Read. Plaintiff's lawyer Harris stated that before Edward accepted the Council's contract, the Council's official representative in London had verbally agreed that the Council's contract was subject to the Yangjingbang land regulations and could only be for a term of three years. However, in practice, the Council's position was permanent, and the contract would be automatically renewed upon the expiration of the three-year term. He presented a piece of material evidence and three witnesses. Edward also stated that the Council's dismissal of his position was entirely due to Mr. Fessenden's antipathy towards him. The court then declared the start of the debate. Council lawyer Read then stood up and gave a lengthy defense, denying any verbal agreement and stating that there was no mention of the Council's position being permanent in the Yangjingbang land regulations, the official contract, or the written correspondence, and that it was contrary to the so-called verbal agreement. Subsequently, the plaintiff's lawyer Haas also stood up to rebut, and finally stated that Edward was already forty-eight years old and had a family to support, making it difficult for him to find another job at his age, and that the amount of compensation requested was also reasonable. At the conclusion of the debate, the court declared that it would reserve judgment and adjourned.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Foreigners' Passports to China</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented from April 1st: The Municipal Public Security Bureau has been ordered to prepare for the inspection of foreigners' entry passports to China. After Chief Chen actively planned, it was decided to establish a foreign affairs sub-division in Wusong, and the inspection will be implemented on April 1st. This has been reported to the Municipal Government for approval and to the Consuls-General of various countries in Shanghai for reference. It was learned yesterday that Chief Chen has selected Chen Timin, a staff member of the Second Section, as the Deputy Director of the Wusong Foreign Affairs Sub-Division. The remaining staff members and inspectors will be selected from those who are proficient in international etiquette and languages. It is now scheduled that Deputy Director Chen will lead the staff to Wusong on the 21st of this month to begin operations.</p>
<h3>Salvage of the Xinchang Ship Begins</h3>
<p>Renting the Yuan'an to Temporarily Replace the Shanghai-Hong Kong Route</p>
<p>Technicians Survey the Ship: Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinchang ship struck a reef near Sijiao Mountain on the 8th of this month and was wrecked, General Manager Li immediately ordered the Shipping Department to carry out salvage operations. The Shipping Department negotiated with the Japan Imperial Salvage Company and agreed that the Japan Salvage Company would first send technician Mr. Komori with several divers from Japan on the Ikoma Maru to Shanghai to inspect the site of the Xinchang shipwreck. Yesterday, Mr. Komori arrived at the Bureau, and the Shipping Department sent engineer Zhang Yao to accompany the Japanese to hire a Jardine Matheson barge to depart yesterday afternoon. They will first inspect the ship's hull and examine the bottom of the ship at sea before returning to Shanghai to report and decide whether to salvage the entire ship or dismantle it in sections. The inspection fee is 1,500 Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Police Team Protects the Xinchang Ship: The bow of the Xinchang ship has now completely entered the water, and the stern is still exposed above the sea after the middle compartment ruptured. The area is full of reefs and frequented by pirates. Since the salvage ship will be staying in Sijiao for three days, there is concern that pirates may rob it. The Bureau has specially assigned six naval police officers with full equipment to accompany the ship to protect it. It is also heard that there are still firearms and ammunition for escort purposes inside the Xinchang ship, which have not been recovered and are submerged in the ship.</p>
<p>Renting the Yuan'an: The China Merchants Bureau has rented the Yuan'an ship to continue maintaining the Shanghai-Hong Kong route and accommodate the staff of the Xinchang ship. The rental fee is 8,000 yuan per month, and the contract is being drafted. The ship's officers, sailors, and other personnel will remain the original staff of the Xinchang ship to ensure familiarity.</p>
<h3>Increased Water Freight on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Deems It Inadvisable to Ban: The Ministry of Communications issued a reply to the Shanghai Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Tea Room Labor Union yesterday: "Your telegram has been noted. The case has been referred to the Shanghai Shipping Association for investigation and reply. The Association stated that due to the increase in gold prices, the expenses of various companies have increased significantly, so they have appropriately increased passenger and cargo water freight to supplement their income. After verification, the submitted request is for the sake of maintaining shipping costs and is unavoidable. This Ministry deems it inadvisable to ban it. Your request should be noted and informed."</p>
<h3>The Loss of the Daji Ship</h3>
<p>The Dada Steamboat Company sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday stating: "Our company's Daji steamship suffered a mishap at Longju Sand. The cause of the incident and the aftermath arrangements are outlined below."</p>
<p>(1) Cause of the Incident: According to Captain Wu Shicai's report, the ship went into the water for the 16th time. After unloading passengers and cargo at Dasheng Port at 5:01 PM on March 11th, it started to sail upriver. At 5:53 PM, while sailing from Zhanghuang Port to Longju Sand, more than ten miles from Xin Port, a commotion was heard from the second-class cabin, indicating a problem. In an instant, smoke filled the air and flames shot out in all directions. Arrangements were immediately made to use the water hose while preparing to lower the lifeboats for rescue. However, the thick smoke obscured everything, making it impossible to take effective measures. At this time, two explosions were heard, followed by sounds like firecrackers. The people on board rushed to jump into the water to escape. Shicai, seeing that the fire was raging and impossible to extinguish, immediately pulled the whistle and fired two flares for help. He then steered the ship closer to the shallows, dropped anchor, and waited for assistance. At 6:30 PM, a customs patrol boat arrived and made every effort to rescue the passengers. The Daitai and Zhengtai also arrived, and the Xin Port Police Bureau dispatched sailboats and barges to assist in the rescue. Shicai and the first mate saw that the deck was on fire and impossible to control. They had no choice but to jump into the water and were fortunate to be rescued by a Xin Port sand ship and transferred to the Longda to return to Shanghai. It is estimated that there were about 450 to 460 passengers and crew members on board. The number of passengers rescued is unclear, as Shicai was busy fighting the fire and was the last to escape, making it difficult to determine. The ship left Tiansheng Port with a total of more than 1,210 pieces of cargo, including 53 pieces of saltpeter and sulfur, which were reported by the Shanghai Official Sales Bureau for loading and unloading at Jiaqiao. These were placed in the second-class cabin. This area is not usually used to store other cargo, and passengers are not allowed to settle there. Both ends are gated to prevent any major incidents. However, after several dozen soldiers boarded the ship at Tiansheng Port, they wanted to gather in one place and designated this area for lodging. The cargo staff and workers explained the above reasons and firmly refused. However, the soldiers were unreasonable and forcibly tore down the gate, gathered inside, and refused to allow anyone to interfere. Unexpectedly, before long, this catastrophic disaster occurred. The company's loss of money is secondary, but the lives of countless passengers and crew members were innocently lost in this tragedy, which is truly heartbreaking. Shicai, having survived the disaster, respectfully reports the circumstances of the accident truthfully and requests your review."</p>
<p>(2) Number of Deaths: According to the report from Zhang Shusheng and Wang Yinqiao, who were sent by the company, 119 bodies were recovered in Zhanghuang Port, 11 bodies in Xinsheng Port, and 5 bodies in Xin Port. In addition, 7 charred bodies were found on the ship. On the evening of the 13th, local fishing boats recovered more than 20 bodies, bringing the total number of deaths to more than 150. They have all been photographed and purchased coffins by the Zhanghuang Port Public Security Bureau, the Shizhuang District Office, and the Hetai shop owner for burial, so that the families of the victims can identify them. It has also been found that 58 out of 132 crew members have reported back alive, while the rest have likely perished.</p>
<p>(3) Ship Loss: The entire upper cabin of the ship was completely burned. Only the boiler and engine were not severely damaged. The electric lights and cars were completely destroyed. The ship's hull is slightly warped up and down, but it can still be repaired. The Chuyuan Iron Barge is being used to tow it back to Shanghai so that it can be docked and the losses estimated. The losses are estimated to be approximately 200,000 taels of silver at the current value.</p>
<p>(4) Handling of the Aftermath: The company will draft a plan for how to compensate the crew members who died and submit it to the board of directors for a decision. Whether or not to compensate the passengers who perished is not legally required. The company feels extremely difficult about this issue, but most of the families of the victims are poor and their situation is extremely pitiful. The directors, in their private capacity, requested the Jisheng Society to provide separate relief. The Society sent Mr. Li Yunmen with relief tickets the night before, accompanied by Daitai Comprador Zhu Xiaozhu and the families of the victims, to the site of the accident to handle the matter properly.</p>
<p>Yesterday's News: The Daitai Company's Daitai ship imported eight coffins containing the remains of victims. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Coffins Arrive in Shanghai: The night before, the Daitai ship arrived in Shanghai with two coffins, one for Daji Comprador Xu Jingzhai from Jiangxi and one for Cargo Clerk Meng Dingyuan from Shandong. They have been claimed by their families. But yesterday, the Daitai ship brought six more coffins, only one of which contained a passenger, Ding Niancai from Yancheng. The rest were crew members: (1) Carpenter Wang Linsheng from Zhoushan, (2) Fireman Xin Shengfu from Ningbo, (3) Fireman Zhou Shunjin from Ningbo, (4) Tea Room Attendant Xiao Ying from Suzhou, (5) Tea Room Attendant Fang Xingquan from Songjiang. All eight coffins will be transported back to their hometowns by their families for burial in the coming days.</p>
<p>Continued Recovery of Bodies: Yesterday, the company received another telegram reporting that Chuyuan and Chuheng had recovered another 29 bodies in Zhanghuang Port, Xinsheng Port, and Xin Port in recent days.</p>
<p>Families Claim Bodies: After the Daji disaster, the seven bodies transported to Shanghai in the first batch by special patrol ship were examined by the Rescue Bureau, placed in coffins, and arrangements were made by the Chonghaiqitong Association. Photos were hung in front of the association. As of yesterday, three people had been identified: (1) Bao Afang, a Zhejiang Zhoushan native who worked as a meat cutter in the Daji kitchen. The deceased is survived by his mother, wife, and children. (2) Qiao Xiaoshi, a 12-year-old from Jiancheng, was the daughter of Qiao Liangxi. Her body was claimed by her brother Qiao Denglou for burial in their hometown. (3) Sun Hanzhang, a six-year-old from Yancheng, was the son of Sun Wenbing. However, the whereabouts of his father, Wenbing, are still unknown. The body was claimed by his mother, Sun Li.</p>
<p>The Aftermath Awaits: It is heard that the company has completed the first steps in handling the aftermath of the Daji disaster, such as coffins and burials. As for the compensation for deaths and the loss of goods loaded by passengers and cargo, the directors of the company have been meeting to discuss the matter for days. Due to the complexity of the matter, the method of handling and the decision are heard to be pending consultation with the Shipping Association. The customs authorities also summoned the company yesterday to inquire about the incident.</p>
<h3>Jiangshun Tragedy Aftermath</h3>
<p>The ship resumed its regular schedule yesterday. The China Merchants Bureau's Jiangshun ship, which had been attacked by gamblers in Huangshigang while sailing downstream from Hankou, resulting in the deaths of cook Yan Er, Wu Shengbao, and others, has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the matter has been reported to the head office by the ship's business director. The head office has sent a telegram to the Jiujiang branch instructing them to hand over the main suspect, Li Laowu, and one thousand other suspects captured at the scene to the Jiujiang Court for legal proceedings. Xu Guisheng, from the Liuxun ship's relief room, testified in court. Yesterday, the ship's business director, Hui Tingsun, issued a notice ordering the ship's tea room attendants and others to unite and resist such incidents in the future to prevent bandits from committing murder and escaping afterwards. For the safety of future Jiangshun ship sailings, the head office has also been requested to temporarily send naval police officers to protect the lives of crew members, sailors, workers, and passengers. Strict measures will be taken against those who board the ship without tickets or carry weapons. The Jiangshun ship resumed its regular schedule yesterday.</p>
<h3>Bust of Smugglers Heading to France</h3>
<p>Liu, an investigator from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Pujiang Water Patrol Team, received a tip-off from an informant that the French postal ship Astorp, which departed from Shanghai on the 14th of this month, was carrying a large number of Zhejiang small vendors and merchants smuggling to France (commonly known as "goldfish"). Liu immediately led police officers on a small boat to wait at the China Merchants Bureau's Zhongzhan Wharf in Hongkou. At around 9:00 AM, more than ten merchants from Qingtain, Wenzhou, and other places in Zhejiang arrived together. Investigator Liu immediately stopped and questioned them. Xie Xiren and Xu Zhizhen had passports issued by the Guangzhou Municipal Government, but Chen Yushu, Liu Zuoqing, Ye Fengming, and Ji Bingnan had no passports. When questioned, they claimed to be seeing off guests, and several people took the opportunity to escape. Investigator Liu, suspecting that the small vendors and merchants looked flustered and suspicious, took the six arrested to the team. After detailed questioning by Chief Xu, it was determined that the passports held by Xie Xiren and Xu Zhizhen were issued by the Guangzhou Municipal Government, but they had been stamped by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification and were legitimate, so they were released. The remaining Chen Yushu, Liu Zuoqing, and others were deemed suspicious and were released on bail pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Naval Translation Office Moves to Beijing</h3>
<p>The Jing'an transport ship sailed to Beijing this morning. The Naval Translation Office in Fenlinqiao was ordered to move to Beijing, and the remaining buildings were handed over to the Jiangnan Shipyard for management. Yesterday, the head of the office, Lu Deyuan, instructed the secretary, Wang Zelu, to move all the furniture to Gaochang Temple. In the afternoon, it was transported by car to the naval dock to be loaded onto the Jing'an transport ship. In the future, the office will be attached to the Ministry of the Navy. The Jing'an is scheduled to set sail at 10:00 AM this morning (the 17th), and all levels of personnel will also travel together.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Factory Requests</h3>
<h3>Reduction of Import Tariff on Waste Woolen Yarn</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from the Woolen Fabric Factory Association requesting the Ministry of Finance to reduce the import tariff rate on waste woolen yarn and telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance. The original text is as follows: "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance: In the case of March 13th, the Shanghai Woolen Fabric Factory Association stated in a letter that the yarn imported by the member factories of the association is made from waste wool. The goods should be taxed according to Item 87 (B) of the import tariff schedule, which is 12.5% of the value. However, the Jianghai Customs is taxing it according to Item 87 (A), which is 35 customs gold units per picul. The determined tariff rate is actually an error. Item 87 (A) of the import tariff schedule specifically refers to yarn made of completely pure wool. This type of yarn is spun from double-stranded or higher wool yarn (such as Bee brand yarn). The value of each picul is more than 400 taels of silver, and the 35 customs gold units tariff only accounts for 10% of the value. The yarn imported by the member factories of the association is a single-stranded yarn for industrial raw materials, and the value of each picul is only more than 160 taels of silver. The 35 customs gold units tariff accounts for more than 25% of the value. It is unfair for the customs to levy taxes on this waste wool yarn, regardless of price, according to the high-quality, high-priced yarn. In addition to protesting to the Jianghai Customs Tariff Office according to legal procedures and submitting a request to the Ministry of Finance, we also ask your association to review the matter and forward it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to order the Tariff Classification and Valuation Council to conduct an impartial assessment as soon as possible to achieve a fair and equitable outcome. According to the Customs Import Tariff Schedule announced by the National Government on December 30th of last year, Section 3 (A) wool is taxed at 35 customs gold units per picul, and (B) others are taxed at 12.5 customs gold units on an ad valorem basis. According to this regulation, the so-called "others" refers to those that are inferior to pure wool, so the high ad valorem tax is reduced to a lower ad valorem tax. It is now said that the yarn used by the industry is made of waste wool single strand yarn and that the value of each load is only about 160 taels, which is higher in quality than completely pure wool double strand yarn. The value is more than 400 silver, and the quality and price are different. The Customs will also levy a tax of 35 customs units according to item A, and the value proportion is actually 25% stronger than the tax rate. It is neither fair nor strong enough to overcome the business difficulties. We sincerely request that the Tax Valuation and Valuation Review Council be filled with duties for re-examination and reduction of business difficulties. Shanghaishi Chamber of Commerce pays respect.</p>
<p>Taxpayers Association Yesterday Letter to the Public Works Bureau</p>
<h3>Please reorganize the land reaction committee</h3>
<p>Advocating the inclusion of Chinese to serve as committee members, Chinese and foreign owners must be treated equally. The Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Public Concession Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, according to the letter from lawyers Ye Shaoying and Yang Linzhi, our client Yang Songsheng stated that Songsheng owned a plot of land No. 177 of the Public Concession, located at the corner of Henan Road and Sijing Road. When the construction was rebuilt in May last year, eight feet were taken over by the Public Works Bureau for road construction. After the completion of the construction, the land price was paid first and then postponed, and the Public Works Bureau privately contacted the foreign business of the registered foreign business. Later, it was rejected on the grounds that the widening of the road was beneficial and harmless to the landowners. In the end, the Bureau handed it over to the Real Estate Committee for evaluation. Although there were three members of the committee, only two attended the meeting. Because one of the members was the registered foreign businessman himself, he was asked to recuse himself. As a result, the committee members judged that Songsheng's land was beneficial and should be handed over for road construction, and the Public Works Bureau did not need to pay the land price. There are few words in the judgment, neither stating the facts nor stating the reasons, and it is incomprehensible to favor one side. This is the process of Songsheng's property being occupied by the Public Works Bureau for road construction without paying the land price. It is our understanding that paying the land price for the use of land is the custom of the Concession for decades and the law clearly stipulated by the state. Now the Public Works Bureau occupies land without paying the price, not only is there no such law in China and foreign countries, but also decades of habits are arbitrarily overthrown. This is something that Songsheng cannot tolerate. First, before the reconstruction, Songsheng could get a weekly interest of 8%, but after the reconstruction, he only got a weekly interest of 7%. A detailed relief list was submitted to the committee, but the committee claimed that Songsheng's road construction was profitable, but I don't know what the basis for this is. This is something that Songsheng cannot tolerate. Secondly, the land opposite the property was also occupied by the Public Works Bureau for road construction. Because it was owned by a foreign businessman, the price of 100,000 taels per acre was given. Now, the land in the same location is given one price and one price is not given. This is something that Songsheng cannot tolerate. Thirdly, most of the land in the Concession is owned by Chinese, while only foreigners own it permanently. Now, the guest is turned into the master, and the important task of assessing the land price falls into the hands of foreigners. Among the committee members, no Chinese are elected. If their land is owned by a foreigner, they will maintain it as much as possible, and if their land is owned by a Chinese, they can occupy it without paying the price. It is hateful to be a domineering person. Fourthly, the Public Works Bureau is the municipal agency of the Concession and represents all citizens of the community. According to public and private agreements, it should treat all nationalities equally. For this reason, we would like to ask your lawyer to sue the Chinese Taxpayers Association and advocate for justice and law enforcement. It is imperative to negotiate. The case is as stated in the letter, and your bureau should pay attention to two points: (1) The treatment of Chinese and foreign owners is obviously different. (2) The land committee's evaluation of the case has become a dictatorial method, and its own right needs to be improved. Two or three Chinese should be added to avoid estrangement. According to the previous letter, we should send a letter to ask you to check and correct the discriminatory treatment of the case as soon as possible, and add two or three Chinese to the Land Committee as members.</p>

<h3>Affair of Xuedie Divorce</h3>
<p>Lin Xuehuai's reply: Lin Xuehuai said that he deeply loved Hu Die and advised her not to accuse others falsely. Details of the Xue Die divorce have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, after Lin Xuehuai received a letter from Hu Die's agent lawyer Zhan Jifeng, he entrusted lawyers E Sen and Ni Zheng to answer. The content is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Dear Sir, I have received your letter of the 14th of this month from your lawyer representing Ms. Hu Die. I immediately forwarded it to Mr. Lin Xuehuai for his reading. Mr. Lin said that when he read the letter, he almost suspected where a flyer came from. The tone in the letter was completely different from the letter, and it was no different from the posters posted on the street. It is obvious that he has intentionally destroyed Xuehuai's reputation. Zhengren's last letter was part of the marriage contract, and the letter was answering something irrelevant. Is it because Ms. Hu's feelings have changed and the words cannot be explained? Only Xuehuai has always known that Ms. Hu would never say such rogue words. Is she already surrounded by people? Those who are required by Hu Die are solved by law, so why accuse others falsely? Xuehuai deeply loves Hu Die. If Hu really thinks that Xuehuai is willing to admit that he is fake, and wrongly admits that he is fake, and forcefully admits that he is borrowing money without borrowing, and forcefully admits that he is invading without invading, this kind of sacrifice is really beneficial to Hu, Xuehuai is also willing to accept this shame, but I don't know if Ms. Hu can have a clear conscience? In short, I deeply hope that Ms. Hu will quickly remove the mask and do not think that forged evidence can forcibly convict people. I also hope that the lawyers on the other side can take reason as the premise and facts as the basis to earnestly persuade Ms. Hu not to contain any more doubts and do not continue to focus on propaganda and put conscience in a place where it will never appear. It is hoped that you will be able to mediate within the possible scope of the Ningren's will. In general, if your party can realize that our party has no other problems." (Below omitted)</p>
<p>Hosiery Factory Owner</p>
<h3>Verdict of Enticement Crime</h3>
<p>Sentenced to one year in prison, declared appeal on the spot. Zhong Xiaoqi, the owner of Guangdong Hosiery Factory on Zhejiang Road, had a love affair with Mei Mei, the daughter of Shen Li, a Suzhou woman in Weishui Fang, and became pregnant. After Zhong abandoned her halfway, Mei Mei gave birth to a boy in December last year. Because Zhong still did not repent, her mother hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to sue Zhong for enticing a minor girl. After three court hearings by the Special District Local Court, the defendant was instructed to release on bail pending the verdict. The case was recorded in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the verdict in the case. Both parties and their representatives were present at the Fifth Court. At 2:30 PM, Judge Xiao Xiefen ascended the seat and read the judgment. Zhong Xiaoqi was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for the crime of attempting to commit adultery and enticing a woman under the age of twenty to leave a person with parental rights. After the judgment was completed, lawyer Ye Kang immediately stood up to declare an appeal on behalf of Zhong Xiaoqi. Judge Xiao then instructed Zhong to continue to deliver the original shop to guarantee the appeal court's hearing and verification.</p>

<h3>Had Not Applied for Change of Nationality</h3>
<p>Yang Bohui Sues for Debt Recovery</p>
<p>许以国籍有问题　　现许自认为华人　　控案移地方法院</p>
<p>Nationality Suspected; Now Xu Claims to Be Chinese; Case Transferred to Local Court</p>
<p>Huaqiao Lianhe Hui President Xu Jigong, concurrently General Manager of Zhenxing Tobacco Company operated by overseas Chinese, previously contracted with Fujianese Yang Bohui for exclusive sales of various cigarettes produced by the company, receiving a deposit of three thousand yuan from Yang. Later, because the goods could not be sold smoothly in Fujian, Yang cancelled the exclusive sales contract within the trial period. Xu refused to return the deposit, and Yang sued. The Special District Local Court opened a hearing and summoned Xu. Xu only sent a lawyer to the court, stating that Xu was born in Taiwan, belonged to Japanese nationality, and was not subject to Chinese court jurisdiction.</p>
<p>At that time, Yang's lawyers, Zhang Deqin and Shen Yuesheng, immediately requested the court to order the defendant to produce the certificate of change of nationality issued by the Chinese government, because Zhenxing Company was actually established with funds raised by overseas Chinese and had no foreign shares. Even if the defendant was born in Taiwan, he could not be regarded as a Japanese national. If he was unwilling to be under the jurisdiction of the Chinese court, he had to produce the certificate of change of nationality; otherwise, it would be tantamount to using the name of foreign nationality to evade debts. Therefore, Judge Xu ordered the defendant to produce the certificate of change of nationality for further verification. At this time, some people suspected that the nationality of the founder of the Overseas Chinese Federation was unclear, and specially filed a complaint with the Central Party Department, requesting a thorough investigation. Xu immediately published a statement in various newspapers, stating that he had been jealous because of his patriotism and protection of overseas Chinese. His ancestors were indeed Chinese, and he had never applied for a change of nationality, so of course he still belonged to Chinese nationality, etc. The plaintiff, Yang Bohui, saw this advertisement as Xu's confession. The court continued to hold a hearing a few days ago, and Yang's lawyer presented the newspaper containing the advertisement as evidence, proving that what the defendant had said before was completely fabricated. The defendant then abandoned the nationality and only claimed that he was currently residing on Baotong Road, Zhabei, and should be under the jurisdiction of the Chinese boundary. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately requested that the case be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial, believing that the defendant could no longer avoid it on the grounds. Judge Xu then approved the request for transfer of jurisdiction and ordered both parties to leave, pending the transfer of the entire case file to the Shanghai Local Court for acceptance.</p>

<h3>Dedication Ceremony of Moore Memorial Church's New Building</h3>
<p>The original site of the Moore Memorial Church of the Chinese Christian Methodist Church on Xizang Road was on Yunnan Road.

The church covers an area of more than three mu and is built in the European style, costing no less than 300,000 yuan. It has 800 seats, with towering walls and a magnificent and solemn appearance.

<p>Weng Jinying</p>
<h3>Sues Tea Merchant for Enticement and Bigamy</h3>
<p>Reconciliation Fails; Debate Concludes Yesterday, Guangdong woman Weng Jinying previously sued tea merchant Chen Yunling, a Cantonese, in the Special District Local Court for enticement and bigamy, etc. Because it did not meet the conditions for a private prosecution, the court ruled to dismiss it. Now Weng's sister, Guiying (i.e., Mrs. Chen Weng), hired lawyers Lu Qi and Da Yaoxian to sue Chen in the Special Court for the crimes of seduction and bigamy. After a preliminary hearing, the court ordered an out-of-court attempt at reconciliation, which has been reported in this newspaper. Because reconciliation failed, Judge Xiao Xiebin presided over the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. First, Judge Xiao inquired about the reconciliation situation. According to the agents of the plaintiff, lawyers Da and Lu, the plaintiff initially demanded 50,000 yuan in compensation, which was later reduced to 1,000 yuan, but the defendant insisted that it should not exceed 1,000 yuan, and the difference was too great to reach a reconciliation. However, since the defendant abandoned Weng Jinying, Weng has been living by pawning her clothes every day, and about twenty pawn tickets were submitted as evidence. The judge then asked Weng Jinying how much money would be required for a reconciliation. Weng replied that at least four to five thousand yuan was required. When asked if a smaller amount would be acceptable, she replied no. At that time, her lawyer, Lu Qi, stood up and said that the reconciliation plan was to deposit 5,000 yuan in the bank and not move it, with monthly interest payments for her living expenses and the education expenses of the future child. Unfortunately, the defendant only offered 800 yuan in advance, so he asked the court to make a fair judgment as a mediator, because his lawyer knew that the defendant's family was quite wealthy, with assets of about two to three hundred thousand yuan and quite capable. The defendant's agents, lawyers Jiang Rong and others, also stood up and said that this reconciliation was not because the defendant knew he was at fault, but because the plaintiff went to the defendant's place to make a scene in order to avoid disputes, and jointly gave a few hundred yuan, and the defendant also stated that at most seven or eight hundred yuan. The court, seeing that the reconciliation was unsuccessful, began to conduct the trial. The witness, Mrs. Li Wu, was summoned and testified, "I live at No. 491 Dixiwei Road. On October 28, 1924, the defendant and Weng came to rent the remaining house from me. They moved in on the afternoon of November 6. Weng came with a short person and an old woman first. The defendant only came at 8:00 PM. I don't know what their relationship is. After Weng gave birth, the defendant did not come often, sometimes sending money during the day. Later, after being owed six months' rent, they moved out." The witness, Mrs. Zhou Wan, testified that she used to run a carriage shop on Wuchang Road. Last June, the shop closed due to the renovation of the house. On November 6, six or seven years ago, the defendant hired my carriage at Zhuangyuanlou in Zhonghongqiao to marry Weng, because I lived across the street from Weng's family. I went to eat that day, and Weng's parents went to pawn things, etc. The witness, Liu Asan, testified that he was a neighbor of Weng. The woman came to my house and said that because there was no income at home, she asked me to find someone to provide income. I asked Agou to look for Wang, who introduced her to the defendant. I don't know if they were formally married. Then Weng Jinying was interrogated by Judge Xiao, "Did you marry the defendant?" She replied, "Yes, I got married." Asked, "Who was the wedding officiant?" She replied, "My older sister." "Why didn't your parents come to officiate?" She replied, "Because I had a bad relationship with my stepmother." According to the defendant, he said that there was no wife at home. Asked, "When did you know that the defendant already had a wife?" She replied, "Six or seven months after the marriage." Asked, "Did you live together after the marriage?" She replied, "The defendant came every day, sometimes every other day." Asked, "When did the defendant stop coming? Was it after you gave birth?" She replied, "No, it wasn't until May or June of last year that he stopped coming." Asked, "Why didn't he come?" She replied, "I don't know." Xiao then asked the defendant, "Have you heard what the witnesses said?" The defendant replied, "What the witnesses said are lies." At this point, Judge Xiao ordered the debate to begin. The plaintiff's agents, lawyers Lu and Da, and the defendant's agents, lawyers Jiang Rong and others, debated each other until dusk. The judge ordered the debate to end and announced that the verdict would be announced next Monday.</p>
<h3>Human Trafficking Case Cracked on Huaan Steamer</h3>
<p>The abducted victim, Wu Lanfeng from Wuxi, was discovered yesterday afternoon. At about 2:00 PM, Yang Chunting and other detectives from the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were patrolling the river to Datong Wharf when they saw the Huaan steamer docked there. They immediately boarded the ship to conduct an inspection and found two men and an old man with a young girl in the cabin, which looked suspicious. They questioned the two men about their origins, but they hesitated in their speech. They were taken back to the team. During the preliminary interrogation by Chief Xu, one man confessed that his name was Tang Xinhe, 27 years old, from Zou Xing, living in Gaochang Temple, Hunan Road, Shanghai. The other man confessed that his name was Sun Xiaoting, 35 years old, from Tianjin, and he ran a Baozi shop in Gaochang Temple. According to the old man, his name was Qin Yishan, 56 years old, from Fuzhou, living at No. 3 Guangdong Street, Gaochang Temple. The three men claimed that the girl was sold to them by a woman surnamed Zhu living in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, and they were planning to take her to Fuzhou to sell her. The girl confessed that her name was Wu Lanfeng, 12 years old, from Wuxi. Her father's name was Jiang Dekui, who worked as a worker in a certain yarn factory. She worked as a maid for a family surnamed in Jiangwan. A few days ago, a woman surnamed Zhu said that Shanghai was very good, so she brought me to Shanghai for about two weeks. I don't know how she suddenly handed me over to Qin Yishan, and today they are taking me to Fujian. Due to the case involving human trafficking, they were immediately ordered to prepare a document to explain to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

According to the hospital report, the Old Zhabei Police Department dispatched detective Cui Chengke to rush to the autopsy location on Feilun Road. The Special District Local Court commissioned Prosecutor Xu to come to the scene to investigate. Chen Fengchao, the brother of the deceased, described the circumstances of the accident and asked the contractor to provide compensation due to the poverty of the family. Yao Yongkang, the cashier of Pan Qinji, surrendered and stated that the factory owner was willing to provide funds to allow the deceased's family to provide a coffin. Prosecutor Xu then ordered Chen Fengchao to make a guarantee to claim the body for the coffin.</p>

<h3>Apprentice Sodomized; Two Months Imprisonment</h3>

Through an introduction, he became an apprentice to Shen Zhaoliang, a plasterer at No. 18 Yuqingfang, Laoshnfu Road in the French Concession. Because the living space was narrow, the master and apprentice slept together. Unexpectedly, Shen suddenly became lustful the night before last and forcefully sodomized his apprentice, Tang Jinyao, causing injury. A French police detective learned of the incident and arrested Shen and Tang, taking them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Court for investigation.

<p>Songhu Road</p>
<h3>News After the Reform of Train Frequency</h3>
<p>Since the use of steam trains on the Songhu Road, there have been 74 trains running up and down every day. Now the railway bureau has re-regulated the train schedule and changed it to 40 trains per day. In the section from Jiangwan to Shanghai, 42 section trains have been added. Some passengers are concerned that the reduction in the number of full-line trains is too much and may not be enough. According to actual investigations, before the use of steam trains, there were only 24 trains running up and down the Songhu Road every day. The sudden increase in the number of steam trains to 74 was indeed an oversupply. Now, the revised timetable of 40 trains per day, although reducing 34 trains, is still 16 trains more than the previous number of trains. Up to Jiangwan Shanghai section will then have 82 trains per day. In addition to six freight trains, there will be more. It is heard that the railway bureau has carefully considered this reform and stipulated the train frequency according to the actual needs of passengers, freeing up the remaining steam trains for special trains when there are too many passengers to ensure that there are enough seats. Passengers should not have any difficulties returning.</p>

<p>Cheng Buqing, a Chinese resident of Guanhua Lane on Route Lafayette in the French Concession, received a letter from the real estate department of French merchant Dibiak's lawyer on February 2 this year, stating that the rent for this year has been collected by the department. On the 8th of this month, a notice was issued to all tenants claiming that the rent would be generally increased by 40% from April 1. Those who are unwilling to pay the increase should move out. The tenants were greatly alarmed and panicked, saying that it would be difficult to accept the rent increase at a time when the market was depressed and livelihoods were difficult. Moreover, the real estate department, claiming to be a French merchant, contradicted the anti-rent increase creed of the French Consul General in 1921. In order to unite, they decided to organize a tenants' association and publicly elected Wang Longchao, Fan Songzhou, Tang Zixiang, Wang Jun, and Zhu Houfu as members, and Wang Longchao as chairman and Zhao Wuzhen as secretary, with the sole purpose of rejecting the rent increase. They visited various party and government agencies to request assistance and advocated fairness. The first step was to send a letter to the lawyer's real estate department to automatically cancel the rent increase agreement in order to maintain the interests of both parties. If there is no satisfactory solution, they will proceed to the second step of dealing with it.</p>

<h3>The Resolution of the Taikoo Anqing Ship Labor Strike</h3>
<p>Yesterday, an agreement was signed at the Social Affairs Bureau. The entire workforce of the Taikoo Company's Anqing ship went on a major strike due to the comprador Fan Chenghua's extortion of meal money from the steerage workers. The Seamen's General Union petitioned the Ministry of Industry for relief. Because the incident occurred in Shanghai, the Ministry consulted the Municipal Government for handling. The Municipal Government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and verify the facts. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation session for this case. The details of the mediation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mediation Meeting: The Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for mediation at 10:00 AM yesterday. Present were the ship's comprador Fan Chenghua (represented by Chen Shaoqing), and representatives of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial United General Union, Li Zuyao, Lü Shuangxi, Chairman Zhu Guilin, and Recorder Wang Zhuanqin. The chairman first reported on the course of the case, saying he hoped both sides would make concessions for an early resolution and to prevent the expansion of the strike. Then, representatives from both sides stated their reasons. After a lengthy discussion, the representatives of both sides agreed to sign an agreement, announcing the mediation was successful.</p>
<p>Agreement Terms: The dispute concerns the steerage meal money. The Bureau convened a mediation session and makes the following record: (1) The Anqing ship's comprador will henceforth exempt steerage workers from meal money. (2) The comprador will immediately reinstate Zhu Shaobai, the head of the kitchen. (3) The comprador will provide Zhu Shaobai with a discretionary allowance for medical expenses as a gesture of sympathy. (4) The comprador will apply to the French Concession Police to close the case. (5) All original old tea servers will continue to work as before.

<h3>Dong Mengyi Regains Freedom</h3>
<p>Dong Mengyi of Wusong previously mediated the Shi case and organized the Wusong Bank in his private capacity, without using his position as a member of the fortress council. On that day, Dong was holding a copy of the Wusong Bank's articles of association and a letter from the fortress addressed to "Councilor Dong Mengyi, Xunjian Qi." While he was talking with Shi at the Nanyang Hospital inside Xiaonanmen, he suddenly had a verbal conflict with a Jin, who was sitting at the same table. Jin reported to the police, accusing Dong of extortion. The news reached various agencies and wealthy bureaus in Wusong. Seeing Dong, who usually resolves disputes and is very amiable, being falsely accused due to a misunderstanding, they could not stand idly by. They stepped in to mediate, explaining the misunderstanding. It is now known that Dong regained his freedom the afternoon before yesterday and is residing in the Central Hotel. Friends and relatives advised him to rest, so he has now moved to the Ren'ai Hospital.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I have recently read the "Local News" section of your newspaper. In the item "Jiangsu Water Police's Fourth District Branch Corrects the Provincial Police's Wrongful Seizure of Printed Cloth," there are phrases such as "buying stolen goods." After investigation, our factory is operating legally. How could we be buying stolen goods? All incoming and outgoing goods are recorded in detail. The police department is making false accusations, which are subject to special provisions in the law. In addition to waiting for the court's verdict, this matter concerns our reputation, so we are specifically requesting that your newspaper publish this letter to the editor for clarification to avoid confusion. We would be grateful for your assistance. Respectfully, The Hengxing Printed Cloth Factory (located in Yangjing, Pudong) March 16th</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I have read today's (March 16th) "Local News" section of your newspaper's "Letters to the Editor" column, which contains a letter from Mr. Jiang Decun, a director of the Dada Company, stating that "the Shipping Guild has no prior resolution or articles of association" and "after inquiring with the Shipping Guild, there are no such regulations." These statements are completely inconsistent with the facts. Regarding the compensation for the families of the passengers who died in the ship accident, on February 19th of the eighteenth year of the Republic, our guild's temporary general membership meeting resolved that, since there was no legal basis and no precedent to follow, and the East and West countries had no comparable cases, the shipowners would absolutely not be responsible for any compensation to the passengers or their families. This was unanimously voted and submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for filing and sent to all members for compliance. Mr. Jiang's letter claiming that our guild had no prior resolution is definitely not true. Furthermore, regarding the Daji ship accident, Mr. Jiang only visited the guild once at 5:00 PM on the 12th of this month. However, that day was the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, and our guild was closed according to regulations. All key personnel were absent. Mr. Jiang's claim of "inquiring with our guild" is also not true. In addition to sending a letter to Mr. Jiang clarifying the facts, we are specifically requesting that you make a correction to ensure accuracy. We would be grateful for your assistance. Sincerely, Shanghai Shipping Guild March 16th, addressed to the Local News Editorial Department of the Shen Bao.</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor: This office's lower-level Japanese warehouse No. 8 was found to be on fire at 1:50 AM on the 15th due to carelessness. The patrolling police noticed smoke coming from a gap in the window and immediately sounded the alarm. Fire engines from various fire departments arrived one after another and worked together to extinguish the fire before 4:00 AM. The warehouse, apart from some slight damage to the window doors and iron bars due to the water entering through the window gaps during the rescue, was undamaged inside. Due to the early detection and quick rescue, only a small amount of homespun cloth and tobacco leaves were lost. The remaining items, such as cattle and sheep skins, tobacco leaves, and sundries, were slightly stained with water during the firefighting. After discovering the fire, our office immediately reported to Director Xu of the General Affairs Department, Director Shen of the Business Department, and Director Huang of the Shipping Department, who rushed to the scene to investigate together. Because the insurance company has not yet come to the warehouse to assess the goods, it is not convenient to move the stored items. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Fearing that the rumors outside are untrue, we are specifically informing you of the situation and requesting that you publish it. Respectfully, South Warehouse of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company March 16th, 4:30 PM</p>

<h3>Discussion on Traditional Chinese Medicine and the National Medicine Hall by the Medical and Pharmaceutical Association</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>Alas, the people of our country are easily misled due to their immaturity and have been influenced by the remnants of thousands of years of despotism. Their customs and habits tend to change according to the preferences of those in power. Therefore, the party-state government during the period of political tutelage should be extremely cautious in its words and actions. It should save the country with science, guide the people, destroy lewd shrines, abolish the old calendar, dismiss religions, and eliminate superstitions. All those who seek to cultivate strength should correct their vision and thoughts in order to engage in saving the country through science. Now, old, outdated knowledge and closed-minded, foolish theories are being exaggerated and promoted. This deludes the ignorant, and absurd, baseless arguments are used to glorify the government. It divides the people's ears and eyes, destroying all previous efforts. How can Chiang use this to stabilize the country? Many paths lead to a lost sheep. Will such actions bring fortune or misfortune to the party-state? As the saying goes, "Do not speak of success, do not advise on completed matters." The establishment of the National Medicine Hall is difficult to stop. The officials who are advocating for the National Medicine Hall should calm down, be rational, and think deeply about their actions. If they repent and change their ways, it will be a great blessing for the party-state. Otherwise, the methods are not yet fixed, and there is still room for correction. The only thing worth researching in traditional medicine is a small portion of the experience with drugs. However, to determine the efficacy of a drug, it is necessary to recognize the disease first. If one says "warm evil" when one has a fever for several days, or "liver qi" when one suffers from insomnia, how can one know the efficacy of the drug? It is appropriate to collect ancient medical books that record the symptoms of diseases, and compare them with the reports researched by modern science to clarify the cause and determine the name of the disease. Only then can the efficacy of the drug be determined. This is something that the National Medicine Hall can do. Take Chinese medicinal materials, investigate their origin, map their morphology, distinguish their categories, determine their names, and use chemical and pharmaceutical techniques to analyze their composition and physiological and pharmacological methods to test their functions to clarify their effects and determine their uses. Only then can Chinese medicinal materials be used in reasonable medical treatment. This is also something that the National Medicine Hall can do. The theories of yin and yang, the five elements, and the five phases are purely the way of witches and shamans. They should be prohibited and abolished. The methods of the three pulses and nine diagnoses and the diagnosis of liver excess and kidney deficiency are completely deceptive tricks. They should be dismissed and abolished. Do not protect shortcomings or embellish falsehoods, show the world fairness, and awaken the ears and eyes of the people. This is also something that the National Medicine Hall can do. If this can be done, then the National Medicine Hall will not be a mere formality, and the 5,000 yuan per month will not be a waste. The establishment of the National Medicine Hall that the officials are advocating will not be a government pandering to public sentiment. The National Medicine Hall will not be a divisive idea against reason. The mouths of slanderers can be shut, and the development of national essence can be achieved without betraying the spirit of saving the country through science. The opportunity for mediation is in this one move, which should not be missed again. Furthermore, since our party came to power, the call to save the country through science has been widely heard. However, in reality, the medical and health phenomena that are most important to mankind are worrying. In education, under the pretext of improving the level of medical education, specialized independence is not allowed, and the path for cultivating talent is narrowed. In legislation, the medical science recognized and practiced by the world is labeled "Western medicine," implicitly placing it in opposition to traditional medicine, which is outdated. In administration, a health organization is sometimes a department and sometimes a ministry, and now it is sometimes an administration. The discussion should be reformed, and it has changed three times in three years, drifting like autumn weeds, and acting like a game of chess. Overall, the intention to regard scientific medicine as unimportant is clearly evident. If one believes that traditional medicine is sufficient to support the country, it is because one does not know the bottom line of new and old medicine and hastily makes plans for construction based on superficial opinions. One does not value science or have faith in truth, and one wants to use mysterious and esoteric theories to override it. It is all empty words and pandering to the powerful. Those who truly love the party and the country are the ones who cry with pain. The colleagues of our association have no animosity towards traditional medicine and no intention to shake the National Medicine Hall. It is for the sake of the party-state and for the sake of the esteemed officials that we dare to risk being presumptuous, basing our words on the Spring and Autumn Annals' criticism of the worthy, and exposing their foolishness. Only gentlemen can tolerate being thoroughly criticized. I dare to ask the officials to truly plan for the benefit of the people. I am filled with trepidation and await orders. It is still cold in spring, and I wish the party-state more blessings.</p>

<p>Women's Life</p>
<h3>New York Professional Women's Life</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>(II) Opportunities for Advancement</p>
<p>Almost all of America's major industries are concentrated in New York. The offices of world-renowned corporations and various businesses are all there. Since New York is the largest city in the world, the professional opportunities there are truly all-encompassing, reliable, and promising. Therefore, there are hundreds of thousands of women in New York earning substantial salaries. Moreover, in New York's business community, there is very little discrimination in the treatment of women.</p>
<p>If women in New York possess mediocre knowledge and lack specialized business skills, they will inevitably find it difficult. This dynamic city needs young people and those with creativity. If women have an ideal that can be translated into reality, then they will easily find their way. Even if they cannot achieve satisfactory results, their talents will eventually be appreciated. On the other hand, women who perform routine tasks, such as good stenographers, competent clerks, or reliable bookkeepers, will be disappointed if they come to New York. They can earn the same salary in their hometowns and save much more on living expenses. Of course, it is enough for a person to know how to solve life's problems and quietly wait for opportunities. However, women must possess some special skills to become successful professional women in New York City. Competition is fierce, and many people are waiting to find a better position in the business arena.</p>
<p>What kind of skills do women need to succeed in New York? Perhaps it is innate intelligence, extraordinary training, or valuable experience. Women with a charming personality, even if less capable, can get along well with the public and be liked. So-called intelligence is often mental ingenuity and agility. In creative work, such as painting, advertising, publicity, and newspaper work, creative power of imagination is most important. Commercial training must be sufficient for banking, investment, insurance, real estate, and similar jobs. Sharpness and agility are indispensable for purchasing, store management, and related work. If doing personal work, then understanding of people must be thorough. Any woman who wants to make a living in New York must have a solid foundation of intellectual cultivation and preliminary training outside of New York. In this way, she can immediately use it when the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>Examples of women in New York who have achieved fame and high positions in the business world are encouraging. For example, a certain lady is the vice president of a bank, and her colleagues listen attentively when she expresses her opinions. Also, a lady was recently elected as the president of a large service company, where she has worked for twenty years, starting from a very low position. Many women hold important positions in large stores, and they often handle millions of dollars worth of business annually. Many of these women started from the bottom, with insignificant initial positions. They are willing to sacrifice everything for the success of their specialized careers. Furthermore, many ladies hold important editorial positions in books, newspapers, and magazines. They also spent many years as apprentices before succeeding. Therefore, women are now truly at the forefront of business. The compensation they receive is disproportionate to their work. Men often receive higher salaries for doing the same work, but this situation is gradually improving. Within about twenty years, the compensation women receive in the workplace will be exactly the same as men's.</p>
<p>There is no single way to achieve success in life. It involves many factors, and even if the situation is analyzed, it cannot be applied to every circumstance. For example, two people may adopt the same strategy, but the outcome will be different. Each person is an experiment unto oneself. New York always extends its arms to welcome courageous and adventurous women, women who are willing to endure hardship and are not afraid of loneliness, women who are determined to work hard, and women with special talents or innate skills.</p>
<p>Parents often disapprove of their daughters going to New York. In their minds, they regard New York as a hotbed of all evils. Many parents believe that this big city is full of mysterious dangers and lurking giant demons. However, if a woman has perseverance, enthusiasm, and a desire to go to New York, then wise parents will help her. They must trust the balance of her mind. In other words, they must believe in her. If their daughter is indeed happy and successful, the parents should be satisfied. On the other hand, if New York is simply unbearable, then it is a commendable thing for the daughter to return home. Many women with sad faces want to pack their bags and take the train home in a minute if their family doesn't say to them, "I told you so."</p>
<p>Women who are willing to combine work and study can find many outstanding opportunities in New York. Columbia University and other schools offer night classes with hundreds of courses, from philosophy to pure singing. University courses can be taken in night school to graduate, or a woman can study several specialized subjects. Business courses such as advertising, banking, and commerce are taught by famous and capable professors. Many large companies also provide sponsorship, offering students opportunities to practice at any time. Businesses pay close attention to those who seek knowledge and improvement through vocational studies. Some even offer to pay part of the tuition. However, working during the day and studying at night requires strong energy, and success must be sought in what is learned. Distances are often long in New York, so a woman often cannot work, live, and study night school in the same area. Therefore, exhausting subway rides, elevated trains, and other forms of transportation are indispensable.</p>
<p>Women who go to New York must have an experimental attitude, fair criticism, and then accept or abandon it with a faithful heart. They must not expect to gain fame and happiness immediately. No magical whispers can be produced in this center of bustling crowds. (To be continued)</p>
