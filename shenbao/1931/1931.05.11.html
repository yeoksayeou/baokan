<p>自前此國聯調查金問題報告書發義表後。歐洲之政治經濟實業等專家。皆起而主張在倫敦召集一國際金會議。以討論挽救金貨缺乏之方法。且謂此問題以英法美三國關係最切。金貨缺乏原因。一由於產量逐年减少。一由於囤積而流通不靈。故用金國必須開一會議。以研究其癥結所在而解决之。此倫敦金會議之説所以盛倡於一時也。乃金會議之召集未成。而銀會議之召集則已决定。且進而研究地點問題。美參議員金氏亦主以倫敦最爲相宜。夫金與銀雖爲兩問題。而實則有表裏相通之關係。一方用金國因金之產量少。囤積多。而成此金貴之象。一方用銀國因銀之產量增。售出多。而成此銀賤之憂。似其原因各異。若合併言之。金愈貴而銀乃愈賤。銀愈賤而金乃愈貴。此中消息。實有通盤籌劃之必要。故其開會地點。不必以用金用銀而異其意見。今之銀會議。有人以墨西哥產銀之關係多。主張在墨召集者。然英美亦未嘗無關。總之此問題重要。在肯犧牲。在能不囿於國界。而不在區區地點問題也。抑吾更有言者。解决世界經濟之難問題。較解决世界軍備之難問題。尤爲急要。故今日世人希望銀會議之成功。切於今日之縮軍會議也。</p>

<p>請願議案</p>
<p>一、寛　蘇省敎育經費并切實保障其獨立案（理由）蘇省於民國十三年度舉辦捲烟特税、定爲敎育專欵、由敎育機關自行征收、與其他財政税收、截然劃分、是蘇省敎費獨立、早樹全國風聲、至十六年國府成立、將捲烟税改歸國税、以本省田賦歲收、劃抵百八十萬元、於是因歲收有豐歉征、額有多寡、以致虚收實支、蘇省敎費遂根本動搖、自十六年度、以迄今茲、各縣欠解敎費、已達二百萬元、預算等於具文、借貸又無抵償、維持現狀、尙虞不給、何能改進與擴充、然此區區之數、使盡能完全支配於本省敎育事業、猶或可勉强支持、乃復將國立中央大學經費年百三十餘萬元、勒派歸蘇省負擔、侵占蘇省敎費總數三分之一以上、旣剥奪其來源、復增加其担負、不特較地省獨示偏枯、且與財部度支厘定省税辦省校國税辦國校之原則、大相背謬、使蘇省從負敎費獨立之虚名、陰受　割朘削之實禍、本年各省校開學迄今、已四閲月、而省費僅發一月、窘迫現狀、已達極點、倘再不謀救濟、恐首都首善國校省校、將坐以俱斃矣、茲擬具　流及開源二辦法、藉供採擇、甲、節流、（一）免除負擔中央大學經費、本國府財部現行度支原則、省税辦省校、國税辦國校、請將國立中央大學經費年百三十餘萬元、改歸國税支出、直接由財部劃撥、藉紓蘇省負擔、並可略事擴充、（二）切實整頓江蘇敎費管理處、查江蘇敎育經費管理處總司蘇省敎費之收支、須嚴訂考成、設有監察處長、人選應由敎育界推選請省府聘任、處内組織、應力事緊縮、少置冗、並宜組織監察、精覈稽核、如是方可績有考成、欵不虚靡、現時管理處處長、徒掛虚名、不親處務以致冗員龐雜、朋比爲奸、種種流言、種因有自、蓋該處旣不受省府之考成、復無團體之監察、每年耗費浮濫、恐不在少數、應請切實整頓江蘇敎費管理處、以杜虚耗、乙、開源、（一）請由捲烟税項下撥成數、抵補田賦之不足、以維持蘇省敎育經費、查十六年七月二日中央執行委員吳稚暉李石曾蔡子民張靜江與前財政部長古應芬前中大校長張君謀等、會商議决有「如田賦項下撥還捲烟税項下支出之敎育費各縣根解不足額時仍由財部於捲烟項下撥足」之議案、現時各縣欠解田賦之敎費、三年來、已達二百萬元、而捲烟税收現已增收至千萬元、應請財部履行原案每月由增收捲烟税項下、提撥若干成數、充蘇省敎育經費、（二）收回省敎育團公有林切、實整理、俾增加生產、以充省敎基金、查蘇省創辦公有林之始、原爲蘇省敎育培植基本、故經營所費、係由當時各省校經常費中樽節、劃撥該林、在於江浦老山廣褒數百里辛苦經營已、逾十數年、確爲省敎育之產、權撥諸十年樹木之旨、則該林之生產當年有增加、乃自改組後主管不明、整理無術、近且轉輾爲農鑛廳林務局所管理、是蘇省敎育因有之產業、以無人顧問、而被侵佔、亟應設法收回整理、否則以相當代價售賣產權、庶敎育經費、亦得稍增補助、（三）請於蘇省營業税項下提撥成數充敎育經費、蘇省營業税啟征伊始、以工商發達之蘇省將來税收必鉅、應請於營業税項下、每年提撥若干充蘇省敎育經費、取之蘇省者、亦應用之於蘇省、蘇民旣盡納税之義務、則受敎育之權利、政府亦不得不予以籌劃也、</p>
<p>二、提高蘇小中等學校敎職員待遇並優予　　保障案</p>
<p>（理由）生活程度日益增高、蘇省近數年來尤覺突飛猛進、敎育職務、本屬專業、而現時省校所有之報酬、實屬過嫌菲薄、敎職員終歲辛勤、難敷事畜、而老病死亡、毫無保障、故非提高待遇標準、不足以維持生活、非明定保障條例、不足以示奬勵、其辦法如下、</p>
<p>（辦法）甲、增加鐘點費、現查他省中等學校敎員授課薪水、均較蘇省爲優、浙贛閩近屬隣省可資借鏡、惟以蘇省敎費支窘、希望不敢過奢、請規定高級中學每週任課一小時、月薪九元、初級中學每遇任課一小時、月薪七元、此實最低限度、較之他省、尙屬不及、而職員月俸、亦應按級遞增、總以能安心服務、能維持生活爲標準、乙、實行年功加俸制、敎育本以研究精進爲中心、任職逾久、則經騐學識亦與之俱增、實行年功加俸、可减輕生活上之困難、可增進樂業之興趣、直接有益與個人之生計、間接可促進敎育之效率、丙、子女得免費人入學、中等學校敎職員職業清苦、收入些微、往往因生計維艱子女之敎育費、無力担負、忠於謀人、拙於謀己、情何以堪、應請規定辦法、凡中等學校敎職員之子女入學、各省立中等學校、一律免除學宿等費、以示優異、此不僅尊師崇需之良規、且可昭示國家、作育人才之至意、丁、頒定撫卹金及養老金條例、敎職員以敎育爲專業服務社會終歲辛勞、不遑寗處、不幸老病則生養死葬、無所憑依、追念前功、情殊可憫、應請明文規定養老尊賢、亦國家郅治之政績也、戊、應設備敎職員住宅、學校敎職員聘自四方、一學期終始、舟車往返、曠日廢時、學校課程及事務、遂受影響、即本地敎職員、未必即隣近校址、每日往來、亦多耗費、故學校必需設備、敎職員住宅、庶能身心安適、專力服務於學校、良多裨益、</p>
<p>三、積極提倡學術研究培植師資以增進敎　　育效率案</p>
<p>（理由）省校敎職員大多係國内外大學或專門學校畢業、於所省習所長、固各有相當基礎、但學術研究與時俱新、敎育師資、應多培植、現時以經費拮据、各學校除循章按課講授外、幾無研究可言、故步自封、文化因以落後、閉門造車、應用或多扞落、宜多方提倡學術、以促進文化、宜注意培植師資、以革新敎育、其辦法如下、甲、規定省校敎職員及國外參觀條例、省校敎職員服務數年後應由公費資送歐美留學、以求深造、或派赴國外參觀、以資借鏡、回國後可本其所學所得、以謀建設與革新、則敎育效率、則日益增進、乙、省校編製預算時、應歸定學術研究費及國内參觀費、各種科學除講授外、應有深切之研究、并宜互相觀摩攻錯、則學術方有實際敎育乃得進步現時省校預算中、除薪金辦公費外、無研究費及國内參觀費之規定、應設法增入、丙、暑期舉辦學術講習會、以發展科學敎育、歐美日本暑期中各項學術講習會極爲盛行、所以提倡學術奬進研究功效頗巨、吾國各地雖有舉辦暑期學校者、但限於青年學生之訓練、於專門科學之研究尙少、於中等敎職員補修機會更無、應請組織暑期講習會、聘中外有名學者、分科講習、俾省校敎職員、得有進修科學育藉可發展、</p>
<p>四、愼選賢能刷新行政尊重士節整飭學風案</p>
<p>有治法無治人、則徒法不足爲政、有治人無治法、則人亡政息、故行政要綱人才與法治、當雙方兼顧、矧敎育行政更宜以學術爲中心、以研究爲標準、故敎育行政人員、須學識聲望、確爲敎育界所推崇經騐主張、確有敎育上之認識者方能集思廣益、審計周詳、方能學有所用、人盡其才、倘僅能簿書、簽諾擅事、奔走趨承、上諂下驕、色厲内荏、致使敎育而官憭化、學術而政治化、則不僅行政失態、抑且敎育破產、上無　揆、下無法守、使全省敎育事業習於因循敎育人士、習於　薄、士節澆漓、學風隨敗、贍念前途、不勝危懼、應請愼選賢能、尊重士節、整飭學風、以增敎育之效率、以培國家之元氣、</p>

<p>中國工商管理恊會、前在聯華總會開會、請統計專家、蔡正雅出席演講、題爲「最近上海的勞工」茲覓得原稿、錄登如下、</p>
<p>工商管理協會、是一個研究工商管理問題的團體、但是這種問題、應該怎様着手去研究呢、吾們先要把吾們應持的態度、簡單地説一説、吾們對於要研究的問題、先應抱着客觀的、公正不偏的態度、去搜集材料、其目的在了解一個問題的内容究竟是怎様、並不是預料他應該是怎様、有了事實、纔可以作爲研究的根據、去求改善的方法、所以鄙人今天希望把關於上海市最近的勞工狀况、扼要的説一説、各位都是商界的聞人、時間很是經濟、如果鄙人能彀對於這勞工問題、供給各位一些重要的資料、作爲討論的根據、那就不致使各位很寳貴的時間、白白的浪費了、可是要在很短促的時間中、把繁複異常的上海勞工問題、作一個扼要的觀察、必致掛一漏萬、現在姑擇幾件重要的事項説一説</p>
<p>（一）勞資爭議、勞資爭議、是近來勞資間一個很重要的問題、罷工是勞方對付資方的方法、暫時停止工作、以求達到要求的目的、停業是資方對付勞方的方法、暫停工作、以求達到資方要求的目的、現在姑把勞資間的糾紛而没有釀成罷工停業的案件、放開不談、先把最近三年、民國十七·十八·十九·年全市罷工停業的數字、來觀察一下、十七年罷工案件計一二○起、關係廠號數凡五·四三八家、關係職工數凡二一三·九六六人、損失工數凡三·○一○·九二六工、損失工資數凡一·五九二·五九三元、十八年罷工停業案件、計一一一起、廠號數一·五一二家、職工數六八·八六七人、損失工數七五一·一四六工、損失工資四八八·六九五元、十九年罷工停業案件計八七起、廠號數六七二家、職工數六三·八○二人、損失工數八一○·一○二工、損失工資四六九·四七七元、停工案件很少、一年不過幾件、細觀三年來的數字、便可知道十七年工潮很是嚴重、入後形勢和緩、漸有向下的趨勢、現在再把爭議的主要原因來説一説、歷年來勞資爭議的原因、固然很多、但是總是集中於工資、雇用和解雇、團體協約、待遇四種、十七年因工資問題而發生之案件、占全年案件數百分之二二·五、因雇用或解雇而起者占百分之二○·○、因團體協約而起者占百分之一四·一、因待遇問題而起者占百分之六七·五、十八年因工資問題而發生之案件、占全年案件數百分之二三·四、因雇用或解雇而起者占百分之三二·四、因團體協約而起者占百分之一四·四、因待遇問題而起者占百分之九·九、十九年因工資問題而發生之案件、占全年案件數百分之四一·四、因雇用或解雇而起者占百分之一四·九、因團體協約而起者占百分之一三·八、因待遇問題而起者占百分之一○·三、上面的數字、告訴吾們十七年因工資·雇用或解雇·團體協約·和待遇四項而發生的案件、要占全年案件百分之六七·五、十八年占八○·二、十九年占八○·五、在這四項中間、尤以工資爲最重要、其次爲雇用或解雇、如果要提倡勞資合作、首先應當去研究這四個基本的問題、現在再看爭議結果的數字、便可以表示勞資雙方的態度和交涉力量的趨勢、十七年勞方要求資方完全接受者、占全年案件數百分之三八·五、資方一部分接受者占百分之三三·三、資方未經接受者占百分之一○·五、資方提出要求者無之、十八年勞方要求資方完全接受者、占全年案件數百分之二八·八、資方一部分接受者占百分之三六·九、資方未經接受者占百分之二八·八、資方要求勞方完全接受者無之、勞方一部分接受者占百分之○·九、勞方未經接受者占百分之一·八、十九年勞工要求資方完全接受者占百分之二四·一、資方一部分接受者占百分之四三·七、資方未經接受者占百分之二五·三、資方要求勞方完全接受者無之、勞方一部分接受者占百分之四·六、勞方未經接受者占百分之一·三、上面的數字告訴吾們、勞方要求完全接受的、很顯著的减少、勞方要求未經接受者、頗見增加、雖則勞方要求一部分接受者亦有增加、不但如此、十八年和十九年、資方也竞有提出條件要求勞方接受、這也是以前所未有的、由此可見現在勞方、已不能像從前向資方那裏予取予求了、換一句説、資方也漸能防禦勞方的襲擊、而開始向勞方進攻了、</p>
<p>（二）工資和工作時間講到上海工人的工資和工作時間、吾們的材料、只限於工廠工人、手工業工人、不在其内、本市重要工業、共有二十一種、這二十一業、共有工廠凡二三二六家、如果照工廠法的規定、滿三十人者、始得稱廠、那末祗有六九七家、如果不照這個規定、這二十一業、共有工人二八五·七○○人、關於工資和工作時間、工人的收入、可以分爲兩種、一種是額定工資率、論時或論件給資、按期發給、還有一種是實際收入額、即額定工資、加上奬金分紅或米貼等等、再减去應扣工資數、是根據市社會局十八年度工資和工作時間的報告、鄙人再依照各業人數的多少、分别男工女工童工核算得數字如左、男工平均每日工資率爲七角五分、平均每月實際收入額爲二十四元三角七分、平均每日工作時數爲十小時半、女工平均每日工資率爲五角、平均每月實際收入額爲十二元七角三分、平均每日工作時數爲十一小時半、童工平均每日工資率爲三角六分、平均每月實際收入額爲八元七角、平均每日工作時數爲十小時又十分之七、男工女工童工總平均起來、每日工資率爲五角七分、每月實際收入額爲十五元九角五分、每日工作時數爲十小時又五分之四、上面的數字、是合二十一業工資高低不一的工人而言、這二十一業中、若照人數的多少來斷定一業的重要程度、那末當推棉紡和繅絲兩業、這兩業要佔二十一業總人數的百分之四十一、這兩業工人的工資、比較稍低、工作時間也稍長、這是因爲這兩業的工人、不一定要經過很長時期的訓練、纔能勝任、所以技能上、不能説怎様的高强或重要、所以工資也比較低廉、棉紡業女工平均每日工資率、不過四角五分二釐、平均每月實際收入、也不過十二元五角、工作時數近十二小時、繅絲業女工、平均每日工資率爲五角三分九釐、平均每月實際收入爲十三元二角二分、工作時數近十一小時、這兩業以女工爲重、所以僅把女工的工資提出來説一説、這也可以説是上海工廠工人模範的數字、</p>
<p>（三）生活費用、要研究勞工問題、不僅去問工人的收入狀况、吾們同時要問一支出的狀况、一個工人家庭、平均一年的生活費用是多少、這全部生活費用、在衣食住燃料和雜項等五類中、各占百分之幾、上海工人生活費用的趨勢、是向上呢、還是向下呢、財政部税則委員會所編的生活費指數、雖然只限於本市的紗廠工人、但亦足以表示一般工人生活狀况的一斑、這五種費用的百分數、分配如左、食物占百分之五六·○衣着占百分之九·四、房租占百分之六·四、燃料占百分之七·五、雜項占百分之二○·六、上面的數字、告訴吾們、工人的支出、以食物一項的費用爲最大、其次爲雜項、雜項是包括其餘一切的開支·衛生·敎育·娱樂·等等、當然也在其内、如果吾們存細去分析、吾們就曉得衛生·娱樂·和敎育·的費用、實在小得可憐、平均一家全年娱樂的費用、不過一元零七分、敎育是七角七分、工人生活的苦燥、工人敎育程度的不能提高、和高深技術的不能養成、是當然的結果了、本市工人生活費的變遷和趨勢、可以在生活費指數裏看出來、這個指數是用民國十五年做比較的標準、這一年的費用等於一○○、十七年的指數爲一○二·五、十八年爲一○七·九、十九年爲一二一·四、這些數字、表示生活費用、年來頗見增加、民國十九年、更有狠顯著的升高、一個重要的原因、就是受到金貴銀賤的影響、物價因而騰貴、物價漲、就是貨幣購買力縮、這種生活費用、驟然的增高、决不是工資增加的速率所可及、使工人們的生活、不得不更陷於悲慘的境地了、此外如失業問題、勞動協約、勞工法令、勞工組織和運動、這許多得要的問題、因爲時間的關係、今天暫不談到、現在且把以上所講的概括一下、自從十六年國民革命軍佔領上海以後、到十七年的上半年、因爲政治的變化、和共黨的煽動、上海的勞工界、可説是在極度興奮之中、罷工到處發生、在這種勢力之下、雇主只有忍受的份兒、這個時期、可説是勞工界抬頭雇主屈服的時期、從十七年下半年、和平與秩序、已逐漸恢復、勞工法令、逐漸創制、以前狂風怒潮的時期、慢慢地過去了、到民國十八年、勞工行政、也漸漸地走上了軌　、勞資爭議的事件、漸見减少、這個時期、可説勞工運運動受政府管理和監督的時期、十九年雇主受金貴銀賤和產業界不景氣的壓迫、不能不力圖生存、勞資間爭執、勞工勝利、雖仍占多數、但雇主的態度轉硬、不輕易讓步、有時對勞方還取進取的形勢呢、這是雇主自覺和自决的時期、這三個時期、是狠明顯的、經過了這幾年的擾亂和紛爭、現在始漸漸地上了正軌、吾們狠希望能達到第四個時期、就是勞資合作的時期、工人工資、工作時間、和生活費用、是勞方切身的問題、應該根據事實來求解决、出品精良、增加生產量、是發展工商業的關鍵、國人多盡一分力、就是多增加一分國民經濟的總量、總理説、勞資雙方的利益、是相輔的社會的進化、全靠人民的合作、可見總理對於勞資合作、是再三注意的呀</p>

<p>— 定明</p>
<p>喜雨中汽車游行五月四日。甘霖沛降。予雖未外出。然據友人函告云。是日下午一時三十分。各機關汽車共三十餘輛。在公園路公共體育塲集合。於二時冒雨出發。前行者爲軍樂隊。兩旁有指揮部。發號施令。有糾察部。維持秩序。計經過花牌樓、中山路、太平橋、挹江門、鼓樓、石橋街、水西門大街、子午路、南門大街、夫子廟、奇望街、中正街等地沿途散發傳單。觀者如堵。返至出發點散隊云</p>
<p>和風裹提燈大會晚餐甫畢。聞笛音瞭喨·悠揚悦耳。急趨視之。則各持紙糊紅燈一盞。燈上粘「慶祝國民會議」七字。魚貫而行。絡繹於泥途中。聞前行者爲各界童子軍及男校生、已過去。女校生踵其後。軍隊尾隨而殿後焉。是晚雨止。薰風拂拂。如天助彼等之逸興。若象徵吾民族之光明。</p>
<p>慶祝大會人人激昻　五日下午二時。在公共體育塲舉行慶祝國民會議大會。余亦未往。聞開會如儀後。由國民會議及中央黨部曁國市等府與各界代表。先後分别演講。末呼口號。奏樂散會。黨國要人及民衆。均大激昻云。</p>
<p>游藝臺前個個歡迎　八時後。余坐黃包車。巔簸於頑石砌就之街巷中。一路隊隊之軍人。或騎馬或步行。人力車汽車進退聲。與吝嗇老彳亍濘滑諸狀。態相映成趣。經復成橋。則秦淮河水。南北横貫如蒼龍之蠕蠕。四圍夜色迷濛。僅點綴一二電炬。南折而過第一公園至公園路。則無數電燈炮結就之監察院三宇。高現於碧空矗立之牌坊正中。又數武而入塲之南門。縱目眺望。人山人海。游藝臺凡分三塲。余首至四南角演新劇處。則一切列女男少年盲者八人。分立左右。合唱清歌。以擁擠不堪。未能向前細聽。故　唔莫辨其何曲。然有三盲女帶黑眼鏡。昻首挺胸。頻頻左右其頭。設非不帶眼鏡之一女盲及四男盲眞相畢露於其左。人猶以爲明眼人也。又趨東南方。則開映電影片。爲新人的家庭。復至唱高調之西北觀平劇。則爲打鼓駡曹三塲同時分演。令人應接不暇。故有鵠立一隅。凝眸觀望不動者。有忽而東南。忽而西北。忽而東南。游移不定者。余繞塲一週。約計觀得。何止萬人。又返身入而子細分析。則觀平劇者最多。爲無智識之羣衆。觀新劇者次之。爲中下層社會之人。觀電影者居最少數。大率皆上中等階級之人。此固隨各個之所好而貿鑒異。然亦足見羣衆心理之一斑。與國民程度之高下矣。至於性别。則男子幾佔全數。女子則寥若晨星。然而或父子、或兄弟、或夫婦、或友朋。均對對雙雙。莫不歡欣鼓舞。惟余則孤子一人。獨來獨往。不覺黯然神傷。遂廢然返。</p>

<p>歐洲人有一種成語。即「希望我儕用齒不多。考其意義。殆以大嚼足以傷身。而節食每能却病也。但就人齒加以研究。則現在之男女。其牙骨形狀。確較古人爲狹小。且有每况愈細之勢。審厥原因。並非關乎語言之多寡。以發生變化。實由古今人之食品不同。有以致之。</p>
<p>有專事研究牙齒問題之某科學家。曾發表談話。謂近所食之物。日趨柔軟。俾易消化。無須牙齦之咀嚼。故齒齒運動旣減。不免逐漸退化。成爲狹細。不過經此變遷。於婦女展顏淺笑時。竟愈顯露其齒部之美矣。</p>

<p>老友王梅癯（晚年易名梅據）先生。以名臣之後蓄道德。能文章。著作如林。負詞壇令譽。埀數十年不改其業。雖簞瓢。晏如也。年逾耳順。精神不衰。方冀其登耄耋矣。迺者十日春寒。藥爐乍熖。竟於二十年五月四日。溘逝於愛文義路遷善里一一七八號滬寓。年六十有六。越二日立夏。舉殯於上海之聯義山莊。葬焉。先生蓋粤之海康人也。是日也。陰雲翳天。大雨繼至。執紼者衆。衣爲之濡。其眞符説者所謂清塵灑道而迎先生登仙境歟。憶予與先生相識於西子湖頭。每於梅花滿地。把洒孤山。襟上酒㾗。今猶審識。近頃先生館於番禺杜氏。海上重逢。過從尤密。計十餘年來。道義相契。論交在師友之間。深以其謙和雍容之度。彌覺可敬可親。爲不可多得者也。蓋其得逸氣於山林者矣。風翻白旐。回憶音塵。能不令人有人琴之感。先生之生。數十年未嘗釋卷。嘗謂得天下英才而敎育之。至樂也。於是百仭門牆。廣栽桃李。予曾戲呼爲簡齋先生。而先生遜曰。僕病未能也。予曰。然則高於簡矣。相與一笑。至今溯之。言猶在耳。而先生竟逝。先生好飮饌。　有食譜之製。從此春晨剪韮。秋夜持螫。風雨最難。故人何在。思之思之。能無悵惘。若夢浮生。黃梁已熟。吾不禁爲先生悲。尤不禁爲先生喜也。衣衾棺槨塋地之屬。皆杜氏樂爲之資。美盡東南。安茲旅櫬。先生地下有知。應爲一慰。世有薄於死友者。聞之能無媿乎。先生有丈夫子二。世德相承。可以必其三年無改也。（却酬）</p>

<p>十一時到亞拉巴。住侖珍Ranjan敎授家。余數月來經印度各地。舉目所接。博士如雲。敎　　授數百。一大會中博士數百不奇也。全是智識階級。此階級大抵同時皆爲資本家。有汽車及花園。念若遇馬克司先生。定是遭危險。因皆資本而智識者也。然余甚有感觸。智識階級雖不遇馬氏。誠然無大用處。遍觀印度大學如樹林。博士如樹葉。而無救於國之亡。無救於貧民之餓。嗚呼敎育破產。博士破產。智識階級亦自己宣告破產也。印度誠不愧文明之國。無怪其藐視世界文化但印人不能解决政治。是其所短。因歷史上非政治之國民。而宗敎之國民也。印人無政治史。不注意王朝之興衰。惟注意宗敎哲學。至今尙爲萬國之師長表。亦偉大矣。嗚呼。奈政治何。</p>
<p>十二日。晤印度首領甘地。Mahatma　Gandbi彼乃住於母地拉牛Pt　Mati　Lallnehru之家。母地拉牛勢力甚大。富可百萬。與甘地爲老友。。余在拉好學生會講演時。學生發傳單。請余講。單上大書祝母地拉牛長壽。余不知爲何事。今乃知其與甘地合作之要人。甘地爲師。即彼乃爲君也。但不幸當學生爲彼祝長壽後。即死於拉克惱。年已七十。全印悼惜。但其子可繼父對。余初見其子。子名解恩拉。Jawahar　Lal年未三十甚秀雅。聞其妻亦健者。解恩拉曾遊俄國。富智識。甘地仍爲其師。殆如輔幼主然。無形中爲印度人民政府也。蓋甘地背後大有人在。余訪甘地。爲上午九時。門前汽車多輛。余所主之侖珍敎授云。彼生平尙未得見甘地也。蓋甘地已爲全印無冠之王矣。余生平最怕講平等。余謂平等二字乃十八世紀盧梭藉以號召市民反抗救政府之工具。以興大革命者。中山先生在廣州時。曾因有人誤解。大受其困難。以統一羣衆故。創人有八品以解釋之。今余晤甘地。甘地當然算一極平等無冠之帝王。然所住爲大洋樓。門前汽車如雲。以大學敎授不得一見。會客時間極寳貴。與司令部無異。嗚呼。人有迷信平等者。天下所以多寃案也。</p>

<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>（四）項圈問題</p>
<p>張寳全這時。也想到了這案子的嚴重。便把他的目光移轉過來。他重新把桌上　　的項圈瞧了一瞧。才依舊用那塊白巾包好。他問我道。包先生。據你料想。這案子的性質怎様。可是一件盜刦案麽。」我答道。「這裏面有幾種理想。都有成立的可能。不過内中有一種理想。最切近眼前的事實。我曾瞧見我的内姨佩芬女士。今晚上佩戴着一條珠子項圈。這匪徒旣也從高家出來。分明這東西就是我的小姨的。」張寳全道。「這理解確很近似。但東西現已到手。他怎肯輕輕去丢掉。即使他懷欵後面有人追踪。他儘可把贓物隨意抛在什麽隱秘之處。以便事後覓取。現在他旣移贓在先生手中。他豈非勞而無功了麽。」我道。「這一着就是他的狡滑之處。他把贓物移交給我。明明是要移轉追踪人的目光。使人信爲我是他的同黨。追踪人的目的重在贓物。他自然可以安然脱身。否則不但贓物未必可保。他本身也有被捕的危險。一輕一重。他瞧得非常明白。他的計劃實在昨厲。這位邱老夫子不是已中了他的計麽。」張寳全連連點頭。表示贊服我的見解。他道。「那麽。我們眼前第一步進行。應得先打一個電話到高家去問問。包先生以爲怎様。」我答道。「這是當然的辦法。剛才你回進來的時。我本早要打電話去。現在還是讓我來打罷。」</p>
<p>可是我正立起身來。要到週番室去打電話。猛抬頭見一個人急匆匆匆的闖進辦公室來。我定睛一瞧。正是我的好友霍桑。那時我的精神一振。彷彿一支被困在重圍中的軍隊。突然間得到生力軍的增援。我心中的快樂。一時竟難以形容。張寳全早搶着招呼道。呀。霍先生。久違。久違。我萬萬想不到今夜裏你也會光降。」霍桑的臉上顯着一種嚴重的神色。他走前上步。和張寳全握了握手。便阻住了寳全的寒喧。一語破的的談到本題。</p>

<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>大東書局出版</p>
<p>一國的富源、一國的强盛、都頼經濟有充分的收入與發展、而且、金融的流通、更其極切的重要、這、即是各銀行業之創設了、中央銀行（Central　Bank）以地位而論與地方銀行相對立、就特權的有無論、與一般銀行則相區别、所以、亦稱爲國家銀行、或稱爲銀行之銀行、關於其意義、學者間所的解釋極多、詮述其切要者可分爲四説、（一）中央銀行爲一國金融上最高的機關、而又爲各銀行的中心、這爲最普通的解釋、即謂無論何項事業、皆須有一最高的機關以總理之輔導之、金融事業尤爲重要措理稍有不善、其影響即波及全體經濟組織、中央銀行領袖全國金融、爲銀行系統上最完善的機關、居於中樞、常令各銀行的業務、依其指示而發生全國金融統一、方能定効、這説比較空泛、（二）中央銀行有發行特權、立於一般銀行之上、而爲一國的金融中樞、這由日本學者津村秀松的解説、亦有偏而不全之弊、（三）中央銀行所以稍减一般銀行所負責任、並限制其權力、這爲美銀行學者敦巴（Dunbar）之言、較爲允當、（四）中央銀行通常皆享有發行專權、並有多數的分行、且因代理國庫而受政府的監督、這爲荷茨渥慈（J.　Holdsworth）之説、但亦不能闡明中央銀的眞義、然中央集權（Centralization）、爲近代國家政治上必採的手段、經濟一事、何獨不然、現今世運交通之日、一國經濟的盈虚、非可以枝節微末致力所能奏効、不使全國金融大事集權、不足以使之調劑得宜、發揮最高度的統制力量、所以國家欲集中金融勢力、必須就大有力的銀行付予種種特權、特許之爲有利公共的營業、維護扶持、增高其操縱全國金融的權威、專意於國家大勢的盛衰安危、市塲恐慌則底定了、財政危急則救援之、以爲一國信用的樞紐、在封建制度破裂後、在政治上造成强固的政府、金融界遂亦發生强固的銀行、是爲因應世變潮流的所趨、不能有所抗阻的了、作者在此、就一般的解釋、下一比諸肯定的説、</p>
<p>中央銀行者、占有一國金融界最高之地位、又享有特别權利、與國家之關係極密切、不圖私利而任全國信用保持與救濟之大責、所以振導一般銀行、維絜經濟而利國家也、</p>
<p>這銓釋中央銀行的意義、雖未能見盡合於理論、但似乎便於整個的了解、關於此、作者在本書的開章就闡述得很明白、使之可知中央銀行與國家有重要的關係、其次、將中央銀行的効用、略計之而分别爲十二項、（一）能增進通貨之効、（二）能調劑金融、（三）能行貼現、（四）能利用貼現政策安定金融、（五）能因應鉅額支出、（六）易於實施銀行政策、（七）易於考察全國金融狀况、（八）能活潑各地方之營業、（九）能發達信用交易、（十）能發行鈔票、（十）（一）能代理國庫、（十）（二）能救助國家財政、這様、我們已可略窺中央銀行的意義及効用、而其所以不同於一般銀行之點、或亦能有具體的認識了、</p>
<p>我國自有銀行組織以來、至今埀二十餘年、銀行條例亦迭經修改、然而實際上銀行事業、毫無系統的可言、因此、我們可以明白中央銀行制度的不確立、無以領袖金融界、遂致小規模的銀行、遍處林立、不下百數十行、其中雖有一二實力較大者、但其資金仍不充實、業務復不發達、實不能應付國中行將振興的產業界、現自民國十七年十月五日、國民政府通過中央銀行條例、并正或成立中央銀行以來、銀行事業似有整飭的希望、然察其實際、亦不能盡善盡美、因適值政治革新、制度創立的伊始、雖不乏可稱之點、但仍多遷就之迹、而且、事權混亂、外力强盛、營業不經濟、法律不施行、一般信用輔佐機關又未臻於完善、更以戰亂未已、匪共破壞農村的經濟組織、運用資金、尤爲困難、作者在此、根據目前諸般事　、而於我國中央銀行一論加以研究、約分爲五點、</p>
<p>一、事權亟宜統一、中央銀所享有的特權、爲發行鈔票與代理國庫二者、是種特權宜由政府付與之、使其專享、然後中央銀行舉措設施、方收整齊劃一之效、這様、在金融財政危難之際、可傾全力以事應付、但是、試察我國的中央銀行、在名義上固然採單一制度、而代理國庫則除中央銀行之外、尙有中國銀行、交通、其它如邊業銀行、勸業銀行、農商銀行、蒙藏銀行、鹽業銀行等、亦享有一部分的代理特權、至整理發鈔、當然是更爲重要仰藉國民政府聲威鼎盛之際、不出十年銀行系統自能成立、我人鑒諸美國歐戰前的國立銀行制度、與戰後的聯合準備銀制度、致改進之速、所當黽勉將事以求無悖世界的大勢、及斟酌國内情形、而以期早時成功、二、營業務須改善、我國以產業不振、信用不良的原故、一般銀行或以無業所營、或以經營不善、相率趨於失敗之途、於是一般銀行遂競行提高利息、吸收存欵、一面又僥倖投資、以圖厚利、而中央銀行則不應有此、即所謂商業銀行固宜商業化、特殊銀行亦宜特殊化、而中央銀行尤須中央化、以爲全國金融之振導、三、外力急須排除、外國銀行之在中國的、如匯豐銀行、東方匯理銀行、正金銀行等誠有碍於國民經濟、及中央銀行的發展、所以、中央銀行性質旣確實、且有嚴密的組織、我人但須對外債有切實履行的保證、即取締外國銀行專橫、尙無問題、何况欵項保管的安全呢、現今政治浙上軌道、國際地位日益增高、而且訓政建設之際、尤須注意於此、四、法律速予施行、現今國民政府成立以後、立法院已制定民商各種法典、值中央銀行創業發軌的不久、國中經濟復凋敝不堪、是種法典宜速由國民政府公布、切實施行、然後凡百企業獲得相當的保障與準繩、經濟自超發達、中央銀行亦可運用適當的政策、以收無上的宏效了、五、倡導信用補助機關、現代的經濟社會組織繁複、欲求　展、自非彼此聯給恊助不可、中央銀行居一般領袖的地位、具宜擔負倡導組設補助機關、從事聯絡的責任、按銀行的補助機關、其最切要者、莫如票據交換所（Clearing　House）及徵信所（Enquiring　Assoeiation）二者、作者將此、也有詳細的叙述、其次、説我國中央銀行制度雖屬草創、然細繹其條例、頗多令人滿意之點、亦加以分析、這實爲研究我國中央銀行最切實的一章、頗有價值的了、</p>
<p>這書注重分析研究、所以作者將中央銀行的各方面皆分章討論、其各國中央銀行的沿革、僅在二章略述其成立的經過、資本的募集、特權的享受等、其它中央銀行的組織、業務、及操縱金融的政策等均分章論述、實爲一部研究中央銀行制度最確切之書、關於我國的、尤爲詳盡、應注意之、</p>

<p>— 曼引</p>
<p>二卷第一期特大號</p>
<p>「亞細亞是五大洲之一、拿面積來説、亞細亞是老大哥、拿人口來説、亞細亞也是頂多、拿物產來説、亞細亞也是有開發不盡的藴藏、…全亞細亞的民族儘可以跨上世界屋背對全世界的人類説、我們亞細亞是最大的大陸、我們亞細亞歷史合文化是最悠久的、我們亞細亞的地位和形勢是最雄峻的、我們亞細亞應該在五大洲中居首要的地位、我們亞細亞人應該對於其他各洲人居領導的地位、</p>
<p>可是事實究竟亞細亞大陸居於何等的地位、亞細亞人民居於何種的地位呢、全亞細亞的民族都在嚴重的壓迫中、全亞細亞的民族都有滅亡的危險、亞細亞民族的生命眞是不絶如縷了、</p>
<p>中國是亞細亞的民族中最大的一個民族、中國的衰頽是亞細亞一切民族衰頽的原因、中國倒霉和失敗是亞細亞一切民族倒霉和失敗的原因、所以中國問題是亞細亞一切民族問題的樞鈕、中國復興是亞細亞民族復興的起點…」</p>
<p>以上是新亞細亞月刋創刋號的宣言、的確、照目前的情勢看、亞細亞民族的生命是不絶如縷了、亞細亞的文化已步入退化的途程中了、就中尤以中國爲最、而中國又是亞細所屬最大的國家、她的盛衰、實足的轉移亞細亞的一切、因此、要挽救亞細亞的衰頽、首先須着手中國的改造、喚起民衆的民族意識、謀建設一五族共和平等之大國家、這是誰也應當承認的事實、</p>
<p>本着這一點、亞細亞的產生、開始關於亞細亞各國的地勢、文化、政治、經濟……一切現在的過去的狀况的研究、委實值得我們慶幸的一件事、該刋現已出版至第二卷第一期、因爲是特大號、凡有關於亞細亞的—尤其是有關於中國邊疆的論文特别未得豐富、計有戴季陶的東北西北西南三個問題的總解决、魏崇陽譯的岌岌可危的滿蒙鐵道、馬確天的外蒙一瞥、於去疾的新疆屯墾及今後之計畫、楊仲華的西康概况、張服眞的法帝國主義侵略下的雲南、李紹雲的中山港開闢與南中國的前途、華企華的東方民族之地勢及其革命運動、陳烈甫的遠東國際舞台之中國民族運動、羅錦澄的百年來中華民族之海外發展、方保漢的圓桌會議後之印度、魏覺中的葡人壓榨下的南洋帝紋力利之士人、郭士珍的日本資本勢力下之台灣產業概觀、陳大中的西伯利亞的產業等十四篇、共約二十餘萬言、讀後眞增加不少知識、茲就其中之要者、介紹如次、</p>
<p>（一）岌岌可危的滿蒙鐵道</p>
<p>滿蒙鐵道是日本侵略我東北最重要的經營、也是日本在東北握得經濟權的總權紐、自建築到最近二十五年間、獨覇我國東北、營業極盛、有「滿鐵國王」之稱、但從去年春間來、形勢突然轉變、收入减少、爲空前所未有、計去年四月至八</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>月底五個月間、鐵道收入减少約三千萬元、以滿鐵爲帝國生命的日本、發現這様嚴重倒退的情形、於是朝野鼎沸、舉國若狂、羣謀救濟之方、本文作者武内立彬氏便是受日政府之命派往東北調查的一位、因了這、他的言論很足以代表整個日帝國主義者侵略我東北的野心、他的設計、是深入我東北的腹心、是值得我們注意的、</p>
<p>他分析滿鐵收入爲什麽會减少的原因、一、是由於银價暴落、二、中國作有計劃的抵抗、由這原因他便想出對付的方法、頗爲我們驚心、</p>
<p>東北本爲我國領土、因受不住日本的壓迫、剛一謀建築抵制外人的鐵路、乃爲日人所反對、這、何異自己的東西被强盜搶去、連話也不准説一句呢、作者雖不贊成日僑主戰論者「救急呵、從速訴諸最後手段、」對待我、然而他主張「尋求中日鐵道相互提携的道路、而發見外交解决的機會」這是我國民所應當留意的政策、本文之譯、在本刋上、不能不説是一篇重要的論文、</p>
<p>（二）外蒙一瞥</p>
<p>本文著者曾親游蒙古多時、所云當然確實、計全文分三段、第一、外蒙財政概况、分一、關税、二、財業累進税、三、人口捐及職業捐、四、營業捐及印花税、五、車馬捐及房租捐、六、銀行幣制、將外蒙古財政進欵情形、述之頗詳、第二段漢商口中之漢人被壓迫情形、一如賦税繁重、二任意罰欵、三任意干涉、虐侮、驅逐、……種種不平等待遇眞是令人髮指、第三段漢人對於三民主義的態度、説明無知識漢商因間接受赤俄的虐待、連帶疑及三民主義爲共產主義、其愚蠢可憐亦復可嘆、在平常、我們總是認蒙古爲我國領土、然而照本文所述的事實看、蒙古對我簡直與敵國一様呵、</p>
<p>（三）法帝國主義者侵略下的雲南</p>
<p>從雲南在國防國際上的地位、過去與現在社會情形、説明法帝主義者侵略的雄心與企圖、我們的確承認本文是一篇重要的論文、在緒論裏、作者告訴我們雲南是中國第一大行省、面積有十萬七千九百餘方里、土地肥沃、氣候温和、五金遍地、牧畜豐富、眞是所謂「得天獨厚」、然而近來爲兵災·匪患·貪官·汚吏……一切的人禍、把雲南人民弄到水深火熱的地步了、益以法帝國主義者的侵略、更使雲南成爲爼上肉、釜中魚、雲南人本身若不圖强、政府若不注意、則非至將雲南送入外人掌握中而後止、以後作者列舉法帝國主義者侵略雲南的事實、如（甲）在政治經濟方面、滇越鐵路公司爲法人管理、郵電仍脱不掉法人的掌握、東方匯理銀行、握全省金融總樞紐、此外洋行、公司、更多至不可勝數、最奇者爲滇越路的軍事化、路上法警之增加、車站儲藏火藥、屬意叵測、（乙）人口的壓迫、移居大批安南民衆、使雲南有人滿之患、（丙）文化的侵略、天主敎師之偵探、製造洋奴之學校增加、（丁）邊疆的蠶食、越界侵佔我土地………凡此種種、眞是爲吾人夢想不到雲南表面爲中國十八行省之一、而其實竟是這様受帝國主義的壓迫呀、作者後又論到雲南人自救之道、應擁護中央政府、充分發揮民族意識、并具體指出消極積極的七項辦法、我們承認是很恰當的、</p>
<p>（四）遠東國際舞臺上之中國民族運動</p>
<p>這是一篇討論國際政治情形的論著、説明中國民族運動在遠東國際舞台上之關係、首段民族運動與外交、指出外交在民族運動中的必要、并例舉北美之獨立、一八四九年以後意大利之統一、俾土麥之統德意志、無一不得力於外交、第二段九十年來之被動外交指出中國近代在外交的失敗、甲、自鴉片戰爭至中日戰這一期的中國外交、其原動力爲帝國主義要求通商的結果、乙、中日戰爭至庚子聯軍、爲帝國主義軍事侵略時期的外交、丙、自庚子以後至歐戰、是列强投資侵略的外交、第三段列强對華政策及其衝突、將英日美俄等帝國主義者對華之事實與利害關係、詳細分析、因了這作者便認定第四段裏所説的中國外交的方針、須以日本爲假想敵、聯美拒英、親德防法、并舉出充分理由、我們不能不承認是對的、第五段二次大戰之醖釀及中國應有之準備、指出中國爲民族生存計、在第二次大戰時之準備、應當全國民動員起來、認定有益於我民族才而戰爭、誠簡明扼要而且正確之至、</p>
<p>（五）葡人壓迫下的南洋帝汶力利土人</p>
<p>著者魏覺中君是位旅行家、曾獨遊遍南洋羣島凡七年、著有「南荒民族」一書、記者曾在本刋上介紹過、而這篇葡人壓迫下的南洋帝汶力利土人、仍爲他遊南洋時所得之作、首述帝汶力利之地形位置、係小巽他羣島之一、轄地頗廣、東北南三面俱臨大海、次叙葡人管理力利政治情、政令不行、官吏貪汚、末有土人之生活、善騎馬、出產咖啡豐富、等簡明而有趣、</p>
<p>除這些重要的論著外本刋尙有「亞洲園地」一欄、據編者稱、「專載亞細亞各地之情風俗及詩歌等、」立意以興趣爲主、免讀者有枯燥乏味之感、本期裏面所登的作品、如格染澤仁的尼泊爾以前的進貢、魏覺鐘的南島反獄記、都能本着此旨、</p>
<p>統觀本期各種論著、都能本着創刋時的宗旨—致力於亞細亞復興、討論各種有關於亞細亞的問題、就中尤以對中國邊疆的注意、與東方各民族的討論的文字來得豐富些、這自然是因爲如上述的中國是亞細亞最大的國家、中國的盛衰可以轉移全亞細的原故、然而在以往、我們没有發現像本刋這様專着眼於此類問題的檢討呢、因了這、本刋委實有推薦的價值、</p>
<p>最後、我希望本刋編者與作者都能這様努力不懈的幹不去、我尤希望全亞細亞民族—尤其是中國民衆都能注意到關於亞細亞的存亡各種問題、并起而實行亞細亞各種民族大會、共同高呼—</p>
<p>全亞細亞復興起來了、</p>

<h3 id="c158">大夏的體育 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 佈寒</p>
<p>過去的大夏體育、確是比較沉寂些、但自十九年秋季遷入新校後似精神即已爲之一振、去冬西青藍球乙組錦標賽之功敗埀成、固屬可惜、（因錦標賽在寒假中舉行、球員多已回里、臨時係於乙隊中凑足人數、結果雖爲滬江所敗、分數相差亦屬至微、）但竟能於上海藍球賽之乙一錦標中、擊敗兇悍絶倫之約翰大中學聯合隊—青年隊當不無小補、而邇來之生氣勃勃、似更有一日千里之氣概、（按青年隊中之溪學敏等原爲約翰之滬上名將、他如林澤羣侯幼良等亦均屬大學部之第一流選手、侯君并於去年代表中華隊出席上海之萬國藍球賽云、）</p>
<p>總之、提起大夏的體育、我亦只覺他是充滿了、勃勃生氣、與夫今後的實力究竟利害到怎様地步、似有發表一下之價值、</p>
<p>第一排球隊　握有氣呑江南的雄心、雖於時報盃之第一循環中以極微比較敗於江灣、但那時是才組織成軍的、當於聯絡上稍感遺憾、而該次漏球之多便是明證、試再爲厥後之對曁南交大法政約翰中央政校持志等隊的友誼賽、無不敬餉三只鵝蛋、總之、大夏的排球隊在今日的上海各校中、除掉復旦、均非敵手、而復旦亦僅是幸運問題耳—何不相逢今日時、—而大夏隊中人才之平均、更屬難得、如朱安民林壤森周雄威關潘安等之救球、衛鼎彝魏佐翰等之殺球、任傑星等之托球、均屬一時不可多得、而尤以衛鼎彝之殺球、更屬有力、輒使敵人爲之膽寒心顫也、</p>
<p>第二網球隊　第一年參加江大體育協會、而即榮膺冠軍的大夏網球隊、確是一鳴驚人、而予滬人一良好印象也、去年（爲大夏加入江大之第二年）之以四比一連敗中央交大、卒於决賽中功敗埀成、深堪婉惜、—上午沈美鎭郭彭年連勝兩單打、而下午之兩雙打中、卒以配脚不匀、連失二局、若能合沈郭之雙打、而錦標則又奚難哉、總之、此次非戰之罪、而是體育主任之失策問題耳、—往事不提、且看來届的錦標、究竟鹿死誰手、</p>
<p>第三籃球隊　此中籃球人才之濟濟、可稱江南首屈一指、除原有之火車頭康約法鐵門胡銘新老將趙嘉斌（遠射名將、但來年殊乏練習耳、）等六七人外、更有打刦均佳之任傑星、近更益以曾挫持志破青光敗眞茹之砲隊幾虎將、實力更覺百倍雄厚、正擬初試芒鋒也、—江大籃球賽中諸將、惜因資格問題未能參加、但猶能連敗交大中央光華中公等校、於茲可見其實力之雄厚矣、</p>
<p>第四女籃球隊　雖係初次成軍、但其進步之迅速、殊堪驚人、前日之以二比四大敗持志、實猶其餘事也、週觀是日傳遞之敏捷、打刦之驍勇、堪爲將來之曁南勁敵、</p>
<p>第五田徑隊　中爲鐵餠鐵球標槍之方思勗胡銘新、競跑之何德寳、長跑之龍澤咸胡定理、跳高之吳錦祺、高欄之關家昌、女子組之陸緯坤鄭碧蓮等不下三四十人、確是一時之强者、隊員中除多屬白虹江南兩隊之健兒外、而龍君且爲去年遠東之中華代表、此次市敎局之長程賽跑、龍君惜因新病初愈、實力未免稍减、但猶能榮膺前茅（第三名）、誠非易事也、</p>
<p>他如棒球隊等亦正在克勤練習中、名將任傑星自屬不凡、其他諸傑惜因尙乏正式練習、未能一顯身手耳、</p>
<p>總之、大夏實力之雄厚、正可炙膾人口、而此次策排田徑之遠征京蘇、當更能給予我們以一些更好之印象也、勉之勉之、</p>

<p>— 珂</p>
<p>「湯團西施」、這是夠多吸人的名稱啊、不但是在她住處附近的幾個大學裏的男同學們爲她顛、就是、就是女同學們、也没有一個不想趁機會去瞻仰她即被人稱贊的圓潤美麗的笑渦。我就是這裏面的一個、</p>
<p>是星期五的早晨。我吃了稀飯、正擎着茶盃立在窗口閒望、對坐的湘突然的説、</p>
<p>「玉、現在去寳山吧、看湯團西施去、」她臉上堆着高興的笑、</p>
<p>「好、我們喊瑛一塊走、」這有趣的提議把我沉浸在幽默中的靈魂喚回、</p>
<p>於是我們三人向那灣長的黑沙路上走去、灰色的雲密密地舖滿了天空、夾着沙塵的海風對着我們的頭臉撲打、這時、身上雖然都覺着有些寒冷、但是、一想到那笑　—惹着人歡的笑　、誰也不會餒縮、依舊是勇敢地熱烈地向前衝、</p>
<p>「呀、下雨呢、」湘説、</p>
<p>「是的、我也淋着一點、」我有些着急了、</p>
<p>「不要吵」、瑛安慰我們説、現在快要到了、快要到湯團店了、我們趕快跑到那里避雨吧、」</p>
<p>這時、雨越下越大了、我們急促地無言地在路上跑着、</p>
<p>進了城門不遠、瑛指着前面一座黑門的屋子説、「到了、那就是西施的家、」</p>
<p>「門口一個人也没有、冷靜得不像一個賣點心的店、</p>
<p>「走錯了吧、」我疑惑地説、「我眞不相信、轟傳人口的湯糰店是這様地冷落」</p>
<p>「不會錯、前回我來過的、一點也不錯、」瑛堅决地説、</p>
<p>我們走進那店門、一個四十多歲的女人、站在桌跟前刴肉、我們冒着風雨來尋找的笑　、没有見、的確没有見、我們的眼睛像找食物的老鼠一様、閃着希求的光四處都搜尋到、房間裏、天井裏……</p>
<p>我們答訕着問那女人、「湯　呢、我們來吃湯　的、」</p>
<p>「挑出去賣了、剛剛才出門、」女人答</p>
<p>「那末……還有……」湘像再要説什麽似的、</p>
<p>我在她肩膀上一扯、「走吧、人家要疑心的、」湘向我瞪了瞪眼睛隨着出來、</p>
<p>這時失望的抑悶替代了我們來時的興奮、我們低着頭在冷風雨下走着、不做聲、</p>
<p>路傍一家點心店、包子、麵都有、熱氣在鍋裏冒騰、</p>
<p>我們覺得肚裏有些空虚、也怕淋濕了衣裳、於是走進店、走上了樓、樓上的窗門正對着街、不知怎的、我感到這里有些像武俠小説上的酒家、我自己也好像是一位英雄、我拿竹筷在碟子上敲了兩下、一個小堂倌跑上來、我們呌了幾様點心、慢慢地吃着、眼睛不時的望着天空、</p>
<p>「你看、」瑛像發現了什麽似的、「雨點不是稀疏了嗎、天要晴了、天哪、我們究竟是有希望的、」她快活得跳起來、</p>
<p>眞的、雨是不落了、太陽漸漸地從雲堆裏透露出來、雲散開、讓出太陽、讓出蔚藍的天空、</p>
<p>睛朗的天氣、熱的食物驅逐了我們的饑冷與疲倦、我們走出店、跳躍地向海濱走去、</p>
<p>一條微曲的狹長的白路、斜斜地隱在兩邊的樹蔭底下、通到不大高的土坡上、走上土坡就可以望見滔滔地白浪、這里的水、比砲台灣似乎更要偉大、看不到邊際、祇是隱隱地一綫、一綫隔着天與水、遠處的帆船、天際的雲影、都好像没有動、很慢地、消失在水天的盡頭、</p>
<p>臨海邊有一排石板、平滑得像大理石一様、我們在石上坐下、温暖的太陽光快活地籠罩着周遭、我輕輕地嘘了一口氣、向英説、「你不是見過湯糰西施嗎、她究竟是怎様的好看呀、」</p>
<p>「見是見過的、但那是一個傍晚、她很忙、她放下湯糰就走開了、她不曾展開她的笑面、也不曾看我、她即嬝娜的輪廓雖然還深印在腦幕裏、可是、可憐的我這近視眼、對於她的面孔是一點也没看清楚、」</p>
<p>瑛又接着説、我有一個同鄕在中校裏讀書、聽他説就是在那晚、中校的同學帶她去宿舍裏玩、很多的人閙着玩、</p>
<p>這話、引動了湘素日一觸即發的牢騷、她憤憤的咀咒、</p>
<p>「可惡的社會、可惡的男子、他們用種種的方法—誘惑與壓迫—製造出夜晚馬路上的塗抺着脂粉的紅眼睛的兜售肉體的婦人、他們剥榨了她的皮肉、再抛棄她的枯該、唉、這罪惡的網、又向天眞的少女、—湯糰西施—高高地撑着、等待她走到下面即落下、唉、受過敎育的、提倡平等的、智識份子、什麽、………」</p>
<p>她説時把腰一伸、輕輕地在石板上躺下、把手蒙着眼睛、</p>

<p>— 良</p>
<p>這幾年中、國人對於口琴、發生興趣的不少、口琴是一件極簡單、極便宜的樂器、吹奏的學習也不像其他樂器的困難和費時、—這的確是大家對口琴發生興趣的一大原因、</p>
<p>在上海、口琴會的組織也不少、而其中最使人注意、最負盛譽的、當然要算中華口琴會、它在口琴專家王慶壎的指導之下、曾經公開奏演過好幾次、在無綫電公司也播過好幾次音、使全國國民欣賞口琴的藝術、</p>
<p>這次全國所渴望、總理主張的全國國民會議、五月五日在首都開幕、籌備處和當局的機關便邀請中華口琴會、到首都去演奏、供全國各省市代表的欣賞、</p>
<p>出發期是五月一日、車資已經經當局的許可、給予免票、大約十日左右回來、在那裏、一日晚上、借金陵大學開一個音樂會、券價、一元八角四角、售票所得、拿來補充旅費和其他用途、</p>

<h3 id="e6">Proposal for Salt Administration Reform <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Urge the National Government to Implement the New Salt Law</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hong Ludong and others proposed to urge the National Government to implement the new salt law as soon as possible and to establish a Salt Administration Reform Committee within a limited time. (Reasons) The new salt law, which was passed by the Legislative Yuan on March 21 of this year, has 39 articles. Its purpose is to eliminate long-standing malpractices and benefit the people. The method is to abolish the permit system and reduce tax rates. If this law can be implemented, experts estimate that it will benefit the national treasury and tax revenue because there will be no collusion between merchants and the elimination of private salt, with a hope of increasing 47,050,000 yuan annually. The reduction in the people's burden is that the salt merchants' exploitation and the abolition of surcharges can reduce the amount of tax paid by each person from 7 jiao, 5 fen, and 4 li per year to more than 4 jiao and 1 fen. After that, edible salt can also become more pure. Therefore, for the benefit of the country and the people, the administrative authorities must announce and implement it as soon as possible. The discussion of salt administration reform began at the end of the Qing Dynasty and flourished in the early years of the Republic of China. After the establishment of the National Government, Chairman Chiang had a proposal. At the Third National Congress, there was a formal resolution. The Legislative Yuan followed this resolution and carefully considered it for two years, and then formulated the new salt law, and advocated the establishment of a Salt Administration Reform Committee to refresh and revise the official system of salt affairs to save waste. The intention is beautiful and the method is good, and the public opinion admires it. Those who are slightly hesitant are the concerns of the financial authorities that the income will be temporarily affected when the new salt law is first implemented. The most conflicted interest is the salt merchants who control the big profits, who will lose their long-term monopoly power. However, it is not the attitude of the revolutionary government to give up eating for fear of choking. The people's livelihood is involved, and there is no reason to maintain the improper interests of a small number of people permanently. The representatives of this conference represent the interests of the people of the whole country, and should give priority to the people's livelihood and promote immediate implementation. Is it appropriate? Please decide publicly. (Measures) (1) After the resolution of this conference, the National Government shall be immediately notified to announce and implement it within this month, and the court shall formulate detailed implementation rules to determine the implementation steps. (2) In accordance with the provisions of Article 37 of the law, the Salt Administration Reform Committee shall be established within three months. (10th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Sibai proposed that the government should announce the new salt law to benefit the people's food. The full text is as follows: I believe that salt is a necessity for people's food and also a source of national tax revenue. It is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. In our country's old system, the salt food was assigned to merchants for monopoly, which is tantamount to letting merchants manipulate the necessities of daily life. The accumulated habits have continued for a long time, and there are countless drawbacks, and the pain felt by the people is almost no different from the harm of likin. This kind of bad policy should be thoroughly reformed, and it should be regarded as important as the implementation of likin reduction. Fortunately, the Legislative Yuan has formulated the new salt law, and it has been passed for nearly two months. The people hope that the law will be implemented as soon as possible to reduce their burden, and their expectation is very urgent. The government is still considering it carefully and has not yet announced it, and the salt merchants in various places have created all kinds of slanders to confuse the public and protect their private interests. This long-term illegality has a great impact on the people's livelihood. Here are some reasons why the new salt law should be announced and implemented as soon as possible. According to the tax rate set in the salt law and the total amount of production and sales in China, the tax revenue can be doubled compared with the old tax law after comprehensive calculation, which is equivalent to increasing a major source of tax revenue. This is the first. Under the salt merchant monopoly system, the price of salt is rising day by day, and there is no end to it. The people's life is extremely painful. The root cause is all due to the merchants' monopoly. After the implementation of the new salt law, the price of salt can be reduced by half, and the people's pain can be relieved. This is the second. Under the system of salt merchant monopoly, the merchants who operate the salt industry are all rich and have abundant family properties. To investigate their sources, they are nothing more than encroaching on national taxes and plundering civilians. If the old system is abolished and the tax is levied on the field, it will benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood. This is the third. People cannot live without edible salt for a day, which is the same as rice and wheat. They should be allowed to buy and sell freely, and should not be monopolized by a few people. After the implementation of the new salt law, the people's pain can be relieved. This is the fourth. To sum up the above reasons, the implementation of the salt law is indeed a measure to benefit the country and the people, and the bad policies that have been followed for more than a thousand years have been thoroughly reformed, which is enough to leave a great memorial in history. It is proposed that the government immediately announce and implement the new salt law to benefit the people's livelihood. Is it appropriate? Please decide publicly. (10th Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Contents of Important Proposals <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Proposal to Establish a National Economic Committee</p>
<p>Proposal to Reduce the Army and Determine the Standard Size of the Standing Army</p>
<p>Proposal to Effectively Relieve the Silk and Tea Industries</p>
<p>Proposal to Determine a Five-Year Agricultural Plan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The proposal to establish a National Economic Committee proposed by Zhu Huiqing, Xiang Dingrong, Wang Zhuzhai and others has been reviewed and established by the Proposal Review Committee and will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) The National Government shall establish a National Economic Committee in order to determine national economic policies, review various cases related to the national economy, facilitate national economic construction, implement the Premier's industrial plan, and other important policies related to the people's livelihood. (2) The National Economic Committee shall be composed of representatives from the party, government, military, economic, cultural groups and experts. (3) The qualifications of the members of the National Economic Committee shall be obtained through election and appointment. (4) The chairman of the National Economic Committee shall be appointed by the Chairman of the National Government, and two vice-chairmen shall be elected by all members. (5) The National Economic Committee shall hold regular meetings twice a year, each meeting lasting from half a month to a month. (6) The National Economic Committee may elect several standing committee members to form a standing committee, which shall execute various resolutions and daily affairs when the meeting is adjourned, and the responsibilities entrusted by the committee. (7) The National Economic Committee may establish various necessary institutions and organize various committees. (8) The detailed organization of the National Economic Committee shall be formulated and promulgated by the National Government for implementation.</p>
<p>Fang Qingru and 54 others proposed a plan to reduce the army, determine the number of standing troops, and the standard of military expenditure. The main points are: (1) Effectively reduce the existing national army and stipulate that the number of standing troops shall be 60 divisions. (2) Military expenditure shall not exceed 45% of the entire national expenditure budget. (3) The reduction of the army shall be based on whether the various armies have made contributions to the revolution in the past and whether they have made efforts to eliminate the Red bandits. (4) Stipulate the term of military service, and soldiers shall be discharged in batches. (5) Implement the policy of military industry. Xiang Dingrong and others proposed a plan to effectively relieve the silk and tea industries. The main points are: (A) Temporary measures: (1) One-third of the 6 million silk industry bonds already issued by the National Government should be used to encourage silk exports, and two-thirds should be used to improve silk factory machinery, and another fund should be raised to repay the principal and interest of the bonds. (2) The National Government shall issue 6 million tea industry bonds this year, two-thirds of which shall be used to encourage tea exports and one-third to improve tea manufacturing. (3) The export tax on raw silk and tea shall be temporarily exempted for a period of five years, which may be appropriately extended if necessary. (B) Fundamental measures: (1) Establish a silk and tea international trade bureau. International trade is of great importance to the national economy. In the past, China's foreign trade was all handled by merchants. Let alone their short-sightedness and inconsiderate thinking, they will inevitably fail to compete with the capitalist countries in the international trade market. Moreover, foreigners often use the power of the country to support merchants, and use it to oppress us, such as Russia's assistance association, which controls our tea market, and Japan's Ministry of Industry, which controls our silk market, so that our country's foreign trade is at the mercy of others. The way to relieve the situation is to create an international trade bureau, hire commercial experts, study and develop countermeasures for international trade at any time, and do our best to promote it with the power of the country, so as to protect the trade policy. (2) Establish guidance institutions for silk and tea production and manufacturing, and hire experts to preside over the guidance, improve silkworm breeds and their feeding methods, and improve the quality of tea and silk and their manufacturing methods and marketing methods. (3) Establish large-scale sericulture schools and tea industry schools to cultivate specialized professional talents for improving the tea and silk industries. (4) Promote sericulture, silk industry or tea industry cooperatives, and implement the following objectives through cooperation: (1) Use new-style dry cocoon reeling machines or manufacturing machines to increase production efficiency; (2) Build cocoon raw silk or tea storage places; (3) Sell all dry cocoons, raw silk or tea together; (4) Use silk cocoons or tea as collateral to establish loans from banks or money houses as capital for production; (5) Improve the breeding of silkworms and the production methods of silk cocoons. This kind of cooperative must be promoted and guided by the government. First, a small-scale pilot project should be carried out in one place to establish a reputation. When one sees the results, there will be many who follow the trend, and it will be easy to promote. The success of the Italian sericulture cooperative is a clear proof of this.

<p>(Nanjing) Liaoning representative Wang Jiaran and others proposed two education plans: (1) Please ask the central and local governments to allocate funds to establish scholarships to cultivate talented children from poor families. (Methods) (A) Use inheritance tax as a scholarship fund; (B) Scholarships are divided into two types: A is a bonus, and B is a loan. (2) Methods for rewarding primary school teachers: (Methods) A. Establish a fund for rewarding primary school teachers by levying income tax. B. Implement annual salary increases, old-age and sickness insurance, and scholarships. (10th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Zhejiang representative presented a proposal to the General Assembly to establish a labor policy. Zhuang Songfu also proposed two proposals: (1) To implement rituals and education to cultivate people's morality; (2) To promote public opinion to reach the people's feelings. (10th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Representatives Chen Xihai and 56 others proposed to implement a monopoly on tobacco and alcohol and reduce salt tax and cotton cloth tax. It is said that the annual revenue from salt tax is 120 million yuan, and the annual revenue from cotton cloth tax is 15 million yuan. It should be reduced year by year until it is abolished. The tax on tobacco and alcohol is 125%, and the tax on cigarettes is less than 50%. The total annual revenue from both is 66 million yuan. The consumption of cigarettes in our country is about 250 million yuan, the amount of alcohol is 200 million yuan, and the amount of domestic tobacco is 50 million yuan. If a 50% monopoly is levied on the value of 100, it can collect more than 250 million yuan annually. If the value is 100 and the tax is 100, the annual revenue will be 500 million yuan, which is still slightly lower than the tax rate of 500% in the United States and 335% in Japan. The current central revenue budget is about 460 million yuan, and the expenditure is nearly 700 million yuan, with a deficit of more than 200 million yuan. If the value of tobacco and alcohol is 100 and the tax is 100, the annual surplus will be more than 200 million yuan, which can be used for construction needs. (10th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The contents of the five-year plan for agricultural development proposed by Chen Guansheng and others to enrich the people's livelihood are: (1) Immigrating and colonizing the border; (2) Clearing and measuring land; (3) Repairing rivers; (4) Establishing farmers' banks; (5) Developing rural agricultural education; (6) Establishing rural cooperatives.

<h3 id="e8">Proposal to Amend the Criminal Law <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Zhishan and others proposed to amend the criminal law. The original text is as follows: (A) Article 256 of the Criminal Law, the original text is "A married woman who commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than two years, and the person who commits adultery with her shall be punished in the same way." The amended text is "A married woman 'or a married man' who commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than two years, and the person who commits adultery with him shall be punished in the same way." (Reasons) The provisions of this article only refer to married women and do not mention married men, which is extremely unfair. In order to reduce or eliminate the fact of adultery, protect the peace of the family, and maintain the morality of the society, it is in line with the principle of equality between men and women, it is necessary to add the five words "or a married man" so that the wife can interfere with the act of adultery, otherwise the husband can arbitrarily commit adultery with others, which is not the original intention of today's equal legislation. (B) Paragraph 3 of Article 215 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the original text is "The crime of impairing marriage and family in Article 256 of the Criminal Law shall not be prosecuted by the husband." The amended text is "The crime of impairing marriage and family in Article 256 of the Criminal Law shall not be prosecuted by the husband 'or the wife'." (Reasons) The provisions of this paragraph only limit the fact that a married woman commits adultery with another person, and the husband can prosecute, but it does not mention a married man, which is the same as Article 256 of the Criminal Law, which is unfair. In order to achieve equality between men and women and achieve the obligation of mutual chastity, the husband can interfere with his wife's act of adultery, and the wife should also be able to interfere with her husband's act of adultery. It is in line with the principle of equality in the Party's program. Therefore, the three words "or the wife" should be added under the husband in this paragraph in order to implement the revolutionary spirit and conform to the meaning of equality between men and women. This is the proposal, and I respectfully request a public decision. (10th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Representatives from Jiangsu Province Petition for Business Tax <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Request that Wholesale Businesses be Exempt from Business Tax</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Assembly representatives of business groups in Jiangsu Province previously prepared a summary of the business tax issue and petitioned the Legislative Yuan. Chen Changheng, the chairman of the Finance Committee, received them. The results were very satisfactory on the three points of collection period, late payment fines, and the use of stamp tax tickets for business licenses. However, there are still doubts about the exemption of wholesale sales from business tax. He was asked to prepare a written statement for reference. In recent days, representatives from various provinces have flocked to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting a reduction in tax rates to relieve the difficulties of merchants. Yesterday (9th) afternoon, Jiangsu representatives Qian Sunqing, Li Shengbo, Wang Jingting and others went to the Legislative Yuan to petition again and prepared a brief memorandum, stating four points. Ma Yinchu, the chairman of the Economic Committee, received them and promised to accommodate them as much as possible. The four points they stated are recorded as follows: (1) The business tax on wholesale businesses is a nature of wholesale. The profit rate of purchasing and selling is very small, and it can only be calculated in thousandths. To force them to bear</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Location Problem of the Silver Conference <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Since the League of Nations' report on the gold problem was issued, European political, economic, and industrial experts have risen up to advocate convening an international gold conference in London to discuss ways to save the shortage of gold. They also said that the issue is most closely related to the three countries of England, France, and the United States. The causes of gold shortage are one due to the annual decrease in production and the other due to hoarding and poor circulation. Therefore, gold-using countries must hold a conference to study the root cause and solve it. This theory of the London Gold Conference was so popular for a time. However, the convening of the gold conference has not been completed, and the convening of the silver conference has been decided, and further research is being conducted on the location issue. U.S. Senator King also believes that London is the most suitable. Although gold and silver are two different problems, they are actually related to each other. On the one hand, gold-using countries have become so expensive due to the low production and hoarding of gold. On the other hand, silver-using countries have become so worried about the cheapness of silver due to the increase in production and sales of silver. Although the reasons seem to be different, if we combine them, the more expensive gold is, the cheaper silver is, and the cheaper silver is, the more expensive gold is. There is a need for comprehensive planning in this regard. Therefore, the meeting place does not need to be different depending on whether it is a gold-using or silver-using country. In today's Silver Conference, some people believe that Mexico has a large relationship with silver production, and advocate that it be convened in Mexico. However, the United Kingdom and the United States are also not unrelated. In short, this issue is important, and it is important to be willing to sacrifice and not be limited by national boundaries, and not to be limited to the problem of location. I have more to say. Solving the difficult problems of the world economy is even more urgent than solving the difficult problems of world military preparedness. Therefore, today's people hope for the success of the Silver Conference more than today's Disarmament Conference.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Received Important Domestic Telegrams <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The above-mentioned business tax is by no means something we can afford. This is the first. (2) The business tax is a type of direct tax. If the tax is levied on wholesale businesses with very small profits, merchants will seek profit from capital and will still pass it on to retail businesses. Wholesale businesses in our country have weak capital, and they often resell to each other for turnover. Therefore, if one item is sold from A to B and then to C and D, the business tax will also be taxed again, even three or four times, according to the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations. Commodity sales businesses are divided into wholesale and retail, and manufacturing businesses must also pay business tax. At the very least, one item must be taxed three times with business tax, and as a result, the price of goods will inevitably increase, which will eventually make all the people suffer from the harm of high prices. In China, where production is backward, the country's tax revenue will inevitably be exhausted as a result. This is the second. (3) In recent years, domestic business has declined, and China's only businesses have gathered in Shanghai, the base of imperialist capitalism. Domestic wholesale sales have almost no foothold. This business tax may not be able to make foreign merchants bear it, but only Chinese merchants are taxed. At most, foreign merchants will only sell goods to foreign goods stores and pay business tax once when they are sold at retail. If the business tax on Chinese merchants is levied on wholesale sales, it will be resold and taxed repeatedly. Foreign goods will only be taxed once, while domestic goods will be taxed several times or even dozens of times. The farther the sale is, the more taxes will be levied, and the higher the cost will be. How can they compete with foreign goods? Therefore, if the business tax is levied on wholesale sales, it is actually a suicidal policy, which will extinguish the last glimmer of life in domestic business. This is the third. (4) All goods must pass through retail stores, which is the final sales stage. Therefore, the business tax can be levied only on retailers who open stores, and it can be popularized without omission. Generally speaking, domestic goods, from raw materials to semi-finished products, all hope to be sold to thousands of miles away by wholesale merchants. If they are sold repeatedly and taxed repeatedly, one item will be taxed several times or even dozens of times. Moreover, the farther the sales are, the more taxes will be levied, which only allows them to be sold nearby and prevents them from being sold far away. How can domestic goods develop? This is the fourth. Furthermore, according to Article 1 of the Outline of Business Tax resolved at the Likin Reduction Conference in 1928, since the business tax is local revenue, it should be stipulated that the provinces and counties should be allocated half each. At the very least, it must be temporarily distributed according to the busy canal transportation method. The funds allocated should first be used for the undertakings whose expenses are insufficient due to this Likin reduction, and not be used exclusively for the provincial local expenses, and then the county local government should levy additional taxes.

<p>The location for laying the foundation was on the left side of the grandstand at the athletic field, about five or six feet above ground. A foundation stone, weighing about eighty pounds, was first hoisted by a crane. The surface of the stone was engraved with gold lettering: "Central Stadium Foundation Commemoration, May 10th, Year 20 of the Republic of China."

<p>The central government representative, Dai Chuanxian, stated that since Chairman Chiang felt after last year's National Games in Hangzhou that national physical education must be urgently developed, and in view of the consistently poor performance of Chinese athletes in previous Far Eastern Games, and with the upcoming Far Eastern Games in the 23rd year of the Republic, the two National Games of the Republic of China Years 20 and 22 must be vigorously strengthened to avoid prolonged backwardness. He expressed his admiration for the rapid progress of the Central Stadium project, stating that the laying of the foundation today marked the beginning of progress in Chinese national physical education, and he wished for a solid foundation and the flourishing of sports.</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang stated that in the construction of the capital, many things were awaiting action, but the construction of the Central Stadium would be completed as soon as possible, regardless of financial difficulties, and the scale would be grand, because in China's current circumstances, to restore national status and spirit, it was necessary to first cultivate a sound physique. Therefore, physical education was even more important than moral education and intellectual education. The spirit of the Chinese nation was stronger than that of other nations, and as long as there was concerted effort, no great undertaking could fail, the nation could not fail to become strong, and unequal treaties could not fail to be abolished. He hoped that all representatives would promote physical education as much as possible after returning to their provinces and cities, so that the entire nation would develop in unison. The ceremony concluded at eleven o'clock and the attendees dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e46">International Chamber of Commerce Closes <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Many Important Proposals Passed</p>
<p>World Silver Conference to be Convened This Year</p>
<p>The Scope of the Meeting Has No Concrete Regulations Yet</p>
<p>Associated Press Dispatch from Washington on the 9th. The proposal to convene an international silver conference was passed at the final meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce today. The conference will be convened this year, and Senator King believes that London is the most suitable location, followed by Washington. In addition to passing this proposal, the conference also resolved several important proposals, such as appealing to countries around the world to reduce tariffs and encourage commerce, proposing the establishment of an institution similar to the Bank for International Settlements to facilitate international financial flows, strongly urging various industries to adopt unemployment insurance and other similar employee benefit systems, and appealing to countries to reduce military spending. These are all major points. Before today's closing ceremony, the head of the transportation group, a Japanese representative, stated that the fees for undersea cables between the Far East, China, Japan, and other countries, and the fees for land cables between San Francisco and New York, are still too high, hindering the development of commerce, and requested that the meeting conduct careful research. Finally, German Dr. Thiel was elected as the new chairman. The doctor did not attend the conference but only addressed the conference via radio from Germany, advocating for the reduction of war debts and tariffs, saying that these two measures would greatly help to reverse the economic decline. Among all the proposals passed this time, the most important is the convening of an international silver conference. The proposal emphasized the difficulties faced by industry and commerce after the sharp fall in silver prices and requested that national committees seek the support of their respective governments for this conference. However, there are no concrete regulations regarding the scope of the conference and the representatives who will attend. Whether the conference will focus on political aspects or only be organized by experts with no political colors will depend on the intentions of the participating governments.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from Washington on the 9th. The International Chamber of Commerce convened today and made an important resolution, formally recording its intention to re-examine war debts. The resolution stated briefly that complete and solid integrity is the fundamental way to maintain international credit and expand commerce, but compliance with this principle is contrary to the fair study of the impact of such debts on international trade after changes in economic conditions.</p>

<p>France Proposes Alternative Method</p>
<p>Germany Expresses Willingness to Cooperate</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th – Reports from Paris and Berlin indicate a possible reconciliation between France and Germany regarding the German-Austrian Customs Union. The report from Paris states that France has proposed an alternative to the customs union, based on the idea of an international agricultural bank. This bank would be capitalized by the industrial nations of Northwestern Europe, which would then lend to the agricultural nations of Southeastern Europe, using their land and harvests as collateral. In the current state of the world market, this would enable sales. The lending countries would also commit to absorbing a portion of the existing surplus agricultural products, and these countries would offer preferential tax rates on these agricultural products. In a speech in Berlin, the German Foreign Minister stated that the Austrian and German representatives attending the Geneva Conference would welcome and actively cooperate with various other proposals and methods for restoring Europe's economic health. However, it is regrettable that the proposed French method has apparently only been communicated to other governments and not to the German government.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 9th – Following French Foreign Minister Briand's speech in the National Assembly, German public opinion, due to the French assembly's unanimous condemnation of the German-Austrian tax agreement, has now set aside all partisan views. There is almost a national consensus against France's bullying attitude. The "Börsen-Zeitung," an organ of the Conservative Party, stated that Briand's speech was intended to intimidate Germany. Therefore, it is hoped that the German and Austrian representatives sent to Geneva will maintain an extremely calm attitude and make no concessions regarding the two countries' already established</p>

<p>position. Germany's previous diplomatic policy has repeatedly lost the sympathy of other countries due to repeated concessions, which is more than enough. Other countries are wary of France's ambition to dominate all of Europe. If Germany continues its usual indecisive policy to deal with France, France will further disregard its allies.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Constantinople, 9th – Turkey's unwillingness to participate in the Pan-European Conference has been announced today by the semi-official newspaper "Milliyet." The political circles are quite surprised by this news. It is said that this sudden change occurred after a conversation in Moscow, because France has considerable manipulative ambitions in the Geneva Conference.

<p>Adjusting Export Production</p>
<p>To Increase Sugar Prices</p>
<p>Reuters, Beijing, 6th – The international sugar agreement limiting international sugar exports, which can be described as a plan, was signed this morning by representatives from Cuba, Java, Germany, Belgium, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. (The following is a National News Agency dispatch.) The agreement stipulates that increases and decreases in sugar export quotas for each country must be based on a target price of slightly more than two US cents per pound of sugar to ensure that sugar producers can make a slight profit. If the sugar price exceeds the standard, each country may increase its export quota by 5%. If the sugar price exceeds 2.25 cents, the export quota may be increased by 7.5%. If the sugar price rises further, the export quota will also be increased accordingly to maintain a balance in the sugar price. The signatory countries will establish a committee in The Hague to monitor the implementation of this agreement.</p>

<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 10th – The Wakatsuki Cabinet's three major reorganization plans regarding tariff revisions have been repeatedly discussed by the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. The main points of the revision plan are: (1) Revising the tariff rate law and improving tariff administration; (2) The anti-dumping law will remain in place; (3) Revising the bonded factory law and refunding taxes on raw cotton, etc. Since the government's three major reorganization goals are to seek financial resources, the tariff revision seems to adopt a revenue-increasing approach.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Yunnan Telegram to All Newspapers: We have received the telegram from Deng Zheru, etc., dated the 30th, which picks up superficial words and recklessly attacks, venting private grievances and disregarding the safety of the overall situation. How shocking! Proposing impeachment has its proper procedures. Now, regardless of whether the entire Supervisory Committee agrees or whether the proposal is established, they rashly send telegrams, deliberately creating panic, clearly venting anger under the guise of public speech, and clearly inciting chaos while falsely claiming to protect the party. Their method of launching it has already placed them in a legal predicament, and their conspiracy to incite people's hearts and shake the overall situation is even more clearly seen by the world. Moreover, having legally proposed it, they should naturally wait for a legal solution. However, Chen Jitang, etc., immediately responded with a telegram from Jiangxi, echoing like a sound, using force to intimidate, and trying to plunge the country into division and disintegration again. Anyone with a conscience should sigh and hate this. Yan and Feng have just been defeated, and the Red bandits are rampant. The suffering of the people has not yet subsided, and the bullying of the powers remains as before. The central government, adhering to the legacy, is diligent day and night, handling danger and worrying deeply, and striving for unity, hoping to end the situation of disputes and gradually move towards construction. It is imperative that the people of the country be aware of the warning of a leaking boat and a crumbling nest, and how to develop conscience and jointly plan for protection. Moreover, when criticizing comrades, one should be considerate of the difficulties and take into account the overall situation. If one is slightly biased, harms the public for personal gain, indulges in temporary anger, disregards the party and the country, loses heart and goes mad, and severs oneself from the party, our revolutionary comrades and party comrades will understand the advantages and disadvantages, distinguish right from wrong, and will not be swayed or blindly echoed by them. Chiang Kai-shek has devoted his life to the party and the country, his safety is tied to it, he takes on great responsibilities, and he is not greedy. He is commanded by the party. How can he be said to be controlling things? He is publicly and loyally serving the country. How can he be compared to robbery? His willingness to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the country is not out of private gain. At this moment, as we recover our legal rights and initiate national discussions, there is nothing more urgent than foreign affairs and domestic governance. How can we bear to reverse the course and push each other too hard? Yunnan has no bias towards Chiang Kai-shek, but thinks of the years of internal war, just now there is hope for unity, Chiang Kai-shek personally led the Northern Expedition, in fact, to complete the legacy of the president. If there is an act of betraying the party and the country, then how can we sit idly by? If, because he endures humiliation and bears heavy burdens, he is accused of grasping power illegally, so that those in charge are overwhelmed by saving their own necks, who will take on the difficult tasks for the country? I truly cannot bear to see the unified situation and the bright future ruined by the mouths of a few villains. I hope that all compatriots in the country and party comrades will uphold justice and speak out, vigorously refute heresies, promote righteousness, and punish traitors. Although Yunnan is unworthy, he will not lag behind others. I respectfully submit this humble opinion for your consideration. Dragon Cloud, Commander-in-Chief of the Tenth Route Army of the Punitive Expedition and Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, respectfully.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Provincial Disaster Relief Association Telegram to Mr. Liangcai for your personal attention: The Jiangxi disaster is extraordinarily severe, truly the worst in the world. More than seventy counties have been ravaged by Red bandits, with many deaths, especially of orphans. Some families cannot return home, and some fields cannot be cultivated. The situation is urgent now, and the future will be even more difficult. We respectfully represent millions of disaster victims to appeal to you. We believe that you feel the suffering in your embrace and will share hunger and cold with those near and far. We earnestly request you to show great compassion, open your purses, and provide assistance. A little generosity will go a long way to reviving withered plants. We are deeply grateful and pray.

<p>Military Expenditure Issues Still Unresolved</p>
<p>Taiyuan correspondence: Since the Jin generals went to Ping, military and political matters have virtually come to a standstill. Currently, apart from Commander Xu Fusan, the other generals have returned to Taiyuan one after another. According to the generals, although Zhang Xueliang verbally agreed to be responsible for assisting with the Jin army's pay and to ask the central government to find a solution, no concrete measures have actually been taken. Judging from the situation, the post-war military expenditure has probably not yet been settled.</p>
<p>In recent days, the issue of troop supplies in various counties in Southern Shanxi has become increasingly serious. In addition to supplying daily expenses, extra levies are being heard of daily. Therefore, local officials and representatives of gentry and merchants from various counties have recently been rushing to Taiyuan to lobby. In general, the current difficulties will only be resolved after Shang Zhen returns. However, rumors here are still rampant.</p>

<p>New Regulations for Patrol Routes of Each Troop</p>
<p>Xuzhou correspondence: The railway artillery troops were originally divided into four battalions, a total of fourteen troops. They were ordered to reorganize and reduce the number of troops last month to facilitate command. Currently, the downsizing has been completed, with a total of nine troops directly under the Railway Artillery Headquarters. Jiang Chuou has been appointed as the commander of each troop, and the patrol routes for each troop have been specified. It is planned that the commander of the first troop is unknown, patrolling the Jiaoji railway line; the commander of the second troop is unknown, patrolling the northern section of the Jinpu railway; the commander of the third troop is Sun Shengzhi, patrolling the northern section of the Pinghan railway; the commander of the fourth troop is Jiang Jing, patrolling the southern section of the Jinpu railway; the commander of the fifth troop is Wang Lu, patrolling the Hu Ning railway line; the commander of the sixth troop is Gu Maolin, patrolling the Yuehan line; the commander of the seventh troop is Wang Haoding, patrolling the eastern section of the Longhai railway; the commander of the eighth troop is Jiang Shunsi, patrolling the western section of the Longhai railway; and the commander of the ninth troop is Cao Qi, patrolling the southern section of the Pinghan railway. After the regulations for each troop were established, they have recently begun patrolling separately to maintain the safety of the railway lines (9th).</p>

<p>Regarding the Proposition to Divide the Provincial Districts</p>
<p>The History, Geography, Transportation, and Customs of the Two Regions Are the Same</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Central Government Not to Separately Divide the Two Regions</p>
<p>Xuzhou correspondence: Representatives of the party departments of the twelve counties in Xuzhou and Haizhou recently met in Xuzhou to discuss the issue of dividing the provincial districts of Xuzhou and Haizhou. As a result of the discussion, it was considered that there was an indispensable need for the two regions of Xuzhou and Haizhou to be undivided in terms of history, geography, transportation, and customs. Today (7th), they telegraphed the central party department, the national government, and the national assembly, requesting that Xuzhou and Haizhou be classified as one province, supplemented by the counties in Eastern Henan, Northern Anhui, and Southern Shandong, totaling twenty-nine counties, to form a province to conform to popular sentiment and facilitate administration. The telegram reads: "Since the Three Dynasties, our country has been plagued by continuous turmoil and repeated warfare. Whether on a national or local scale, there have rarely been periods of several hundred years without conflict. Tracing the origin of the disasters, it is generally due to the excessive size of the divided provinces and districts, making measures difficult to implement, which has gradually evolved into a separatist situation. Our central government, in view of this, and for the sake of ending war and promoting peace, has proposed the idea of dividing the country into sixty-nine provinces. Upon hearing this, we were overjoyed. Recently, we heard rumors that Xuzhou would be assigned to Guide province and Haizhou would be assigned to Huaihai province. If this is true, the central government may have other good plans, but Xuzhou and Haizhou have close relations in history, geography, and popular customs, and there is an inseparable trend. We have to briefly state it: Examining the division of the nine provinces by Xia Yu, Haidai and Huai were Xuzhou, and the governor of Xuzhou in the Later Han Dynasty governed Tan, and Haizhou was the state of Tan. In the third year of the Republic of China, Xuzhou Daoyin was established. Historically speaking, Xuzhou and Haizhou were originally one family, and it seems inappropriate to separate them. First, in terms of geography, Xuzhou and Haizhou are located at the same latitude of 35 degrees north, and their territories are adjacent and rivers intersect, so it seems inappropriate to separate them. Second, the Longhai Railway runs directly through Xuzhou. In the future, when the Haizhou commercial port is completed, Xuzhou and Haizhou will be no different from a gate and a hall. The so-called lips and teeth are interdependent, so it seems inappropriate to separate them in terms of situation and transportation. Third, furthermore, Xuzhou and Haizhou have the same climate, and their customs and habits are completely similar. If they can be classified as one province, there will be no risk of obstacles in future administrative measures. This is the fourth reason why it is impossible to separate them in terms of popular customs. Now that our party has unified the country, all ethnic prejudices and feudal ideas should be completely eliminated, and there should be no distinction between this boundary and that boundary. However, for the sake of administrative convenience, it seems appropriate to give due consideration. Although Xuzhou and Guide are adjacent, they belong to two provinces. Is it not because their customs and habits are different and their popular sentiments are also different? The political measures of Jiangsu and Henan provinces are all governed separately. Moreover, the people of the two provinces have had border disputes, which have been incompatible for a long time. If the people who cannot tolerate each other are classified as one province, the administrative obstacles will be difficult to escape. It would be better for Xuzhou and Haizhou to be the same province, the same road, the same customs and the same popular sentiments. The people of Xuzhou and Haizhou have seen this and held a meeting on April 8 at the Tongshan County Party Department. The representatives of the twelve counties who attended the meeting resolved to telegraph the Central Party Department, the National Government, and the National Assembly, requesting that the twelve counties of Xuzhou and Haizhou, as well as Si, Ling, Su, Wo, Hao in Anhui, Yong, Xia, Shangqiu in Henan, Tan, Lin, Fei, Teng, Yu, Jin, Shan, Cao in Shandong, be classified as one province. The reason for this is that it is reasonable to appeal to you to adopt public opinion and approve the request, so as to benefit administration and conform to public sentiment. It is impossible to wait for orders in a hurry (7th).</p>
<h3 id="e57">National Government Consoles the Fujian Provincial Committee <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Committee Resigns Due to Lack of Financial Resources</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian's finances have recently become increasingly difficult, and the various new taxes launched by the Finance Department cannot be implemented due to strong opposition from merchants and the public, and they are rejected for violating departmental regulations. He Gonggan, the director of the Finance Department, therefore feels deeply helpless. As a result, the expenses of the various agencies in the provincial capital have been in arrears for two months. Yang Shuzhuang, the chairman of the provincial government, specially convened a discussion meeting with the members of the provincial government on the day before he went to Beijing (April 27). He said that he and Chen Peikun, the provincial commissioner, would report the financial difficulties of Fujian province to Chairman Chiang and Minister Song in person and ask for a relief plan. If there is no solution, they will resign. His attitude was very firm. The members also expressed their willingness to advance and retreat with Yang. Therefore, Yang Shuzhuang immediately took the lead, and Fang Shengtao, Zheng Baojing, Cheng Shizheng, Xu Xianshi, Lin Zhiyuan, He Gonggan, and Jiang Pingfan jointly sent a telegram to the national government, stating that the financial situation of the Fujian government could not be remedied and requesting permission to resign and appoint capable people to come to Fujian to preside over the reorganization. Therefore, after Yang Shuzhuang left, Fuzhou society widely spread the rumor that Yang would not return to Fujian and the provincial government would be reorganized. However, on the 3rd of this month, the provincial government received a reply from the national government, stating that the Fujian government was in need of construction. If they worked together with one heart, the difficulties could be gradually resolved. The chairman and others were loyal to the country and hoped to endure the difficulties and meet the expectations. The request for resignation should not be discussed. However, the opinions of the members still depend on the results of Yang and Chen's contact with the central government before a decision can be made on whether to stay or leave (May 4th).</p>

Hu Pu'an was elected as the chairman and led the ceremony. They bowed three times to the spirits of the martyrs who died in previous battles, respectfully read the President's will, and observed a moment of silence. Then, Chairman Hu reported on the significance of the meeting, followed by Cao Minghuan, Wu Lianqing, Dai Jingnian, and representatives of the Bookstore Association, who took the stage to give speeches, explaining the significance of commemorating national humiliation and the efforts that should be made in the future in great detail.

<p>Extension for Two Months</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force telegraphed the Pacification Supervision Office yesterday, stating that according to a telegram from Fang Huan and others, citizens of Pinghu, bandits are rampant at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The governments of the two provinces established a temporary bandit suppression command in Jiaping and the four counties, and Commander Cao Pang of the Songhu Pacification Division led the navy, army, police, and police to search and suppress the bandits, which was welcomed by the people. However, the two provinces originally planned to end the command at the end of April, but many fierce bandits still escaped and fled into the ocean, looting and plundering wantonly. Recently, bandits have been rampant in Jin and Ping counties, and the people of Pinghu are in constant fear. Please order the governments of the two provinces to extend the command for two months to complete the task. At the same time, according to a telegram from Zhu Shuyuan and others, the standing committee of the Yunjiang Beijing Fellow Association, the situation is the same.

<p>Duan's Bandits Trapped in the Vicinity of Lotus Temple</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Long's remnant bandits previously entrenched themselves in the Xuejiaping and Guoheping areas. After being pursued and suppressed by various armies, they suffered heavy casualties. Yanchi and Gaoqiao and other places were occupied by the Tenth Army. The Leijiapo line was occupied by Cao's Regiment of Fan Shisheng's Division. Xiaojia Weir was occupied by Chen's Regiment. In the Yangping area, the various regiments of Yuan Futong of Guo Xun's Department occupied it. He's bandits were besieged on all sides, so they fled to the Ganxi, Linjiansi, Xinxianping, and Matouhe areas in Yuan'an, and will move southwest, intending to return to Xingshan. According to various telegrams, the Wuhan Camp ordered the various armies to thoroughly encircle and suppress the bandits on the 8th to eliminate the roots. Xu Yuanquan also ordered Chen Quzhen's Department to advance from Sangzhi to Hefeng, and Li Zongjian's Department to advance from Yuyang Pass to Wufeng, to attack the bandits' flanks. As for the remnants of Duan Dechang's bandits, who fled back to the vicinity of the Lotus Temple, they were also surrounded by the Hunan and Hubei armies and could be resolved.

(4) Luo Zhuoying telegram: According to a telegram from Ling, the commander of the 61st Regiment of this division, more than 2,000 Red bandits with hundreds of guns are occupying Meitian, Taizimiao, Yanglinqiao and other places. I immediately led the two and three battalions to join the local militias of Hubei and Xian counties to launch a campaign. According to a telegram from Li Ming, the brigade commander of the 32nd Brigade of this division, the First Battalion of Chen's Regiment launched a fierce bombardment on Taipingdong and has broken through the first layer of the cave. They are now continuing to attack (May 8).</p>
<h3 id="e61">Split Within the Jiangxi Red Bandit Forces <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Zhu De Launched a Riot in Futian</p>
<p>Huang Gonglue Declared Opposition to Zhu</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The mutual infighting between Zhu De and Mao Zedong has long become irreconcilable. Zhu's bandits even instigated the AB group to riot in Futian, destroying the Futian pseudo-Soviet. Li Shaojiu (Labor and Peasant Commissioner) and Liu Tiechao (pseudo-Commander of the 20th Army) were detained. As a result, Red bandit Huang Gonglue issued a declaration accusing Zhu De of being commanded by the Chen Duxiu of the abolitionist faction, destroying the organization. Now, the Propaganda Department of the General Headquarters has received a copy of Huang's declaration sent by the 40th Division, which shows that the Red bandits have been divided into four or five factions. The declaration roughly states that Duan Liangbi, Li Bofang, Liu Di, Xie Han, Chang Jin, Wanbang, etc., communist party members of the rich peasant and landlord class who claimed to be the revolutionary leaders of Jiangxi, joined the AB group abolitionist faction in an attempt to eliminate the Soviet and eliminate the Red Army. Now that the plot has been leaked, the officers and soldiers of the 20th Army, who were deceived by the AB group Liu Di, mutinied in Donggu, broke into Futian, overthrew the Jiangxi Provincial Soviet Government, destroyed the Jiangxi Provincial Action Committee, released the AB group abolitionist faction leaders Duan Liangbi, Li Bofang, Jin Wanbang and other major criminals, and detained Yi Ershi, the central inspector, Liu Tiechao, the commander of the 20th Army, and Li Shaojiu, the special commissioner of the Chinese Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Committee, and drove away Lu Shan, the chairman of the provincial government. This incident is a conspiracy of the AB group abolitionist faction. I hereby declare as follows: (1) Xie Han, Chang Duan, Liangbi Li, Bofang and others came from the rich peasant and landlord class. For the past two or three years, they have not advocated land distribution. Last year, at the 27th joint meeting, under the leadership of Liu Shiqi and others, they reluctantly implemented land distribution. In July, at the Second Plenary Session of the Ganxi Southwest Special Committee, Duan Liangbi and others, in the name of the central government, opposed land distribution by pretexting the transformation of peasant consciousness, abused the slogan of centralized armed forces, and did not leave a single gun, becoming the Red Army of the AB group and implementing class struggle. They wanted to send the Red Army to the white area to eliminate them. At the same time, they greatly developed organizations in various counties and arranged counter-revolutionary riots, and sent the AB group abolitionist faction to infiltrate the Red Army in the name of expanding the Red Army, secretly making white flags, and scheduled riots. Duan Liangbi, Li Bofang, Jin Wanbang and others were arrested at that time and personally confessed that they were the leaders of the AB group. They took the theory of the abolitionist faction on the outside and secretly did the practical work of the AB group in government agencies and parties. It was completely a counter-revolutionary conspiracy under the command of Chen Duxiu. (2) The Futian Incident is the total riot of the AB group abolitionist faction in openly counter-revolution. Their conspiracy is to abolish the land revolution, eliminate the Soviet, eliminate the Red Army, suppress the poor workers and peasants, and attempt to split the revolutionary forces with the slogan of defeating Mao Zedong and supporting Zhu Peng Huang.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Qingdao Business Tax Implementation Nears <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Business Tax Preparatory Committee dispatched personnel to investigate everything, and it is mostly completed. The committee held its ninth meeting on the 6th, chaired by Guo Binghe. The discussion items included: 1. The Finance Bureau proposed a draft amendment to the implementation rules of the Business Tax Regulations, which was resolved to be retained. 2. The Finance Bureau proposed a revised plan for the Business Tax Assessment Standards and Tax Rate Table, which was resolved to be amended and passed. 3. The Second Section proposed requests from various trade associations for tax reduction or exemption from business tax or for amendment of tax rates, which was resolved that the tax rates have been reviewed and revised, and will be submitted to the central government for approval. In addition, the committee has discussed the method of collecting business tax several times, and solicited the opinions of various members for adoption. The date of implementation is probably not far away.</p>
<p>The Finance Bureau received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, explaining the scope of business tax exemption: 1. Wholesale businesses directly established by construction companies are exempt from business tax, but commercial firms and shops that promote and sell are still subject to tax. 2. Zhuang households that only buy and do not sell, and have no business income, may be exempt from business tax. (May 7)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Survey of Sutra Collections in Shandong <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Buddhist Sutras are more numerous, Daoist Sutras are the fewest.</p>
<p>The Sutra Collection of Laoshan is perfectly preserved.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Great Sutra Collection of Hainan Temple in Yexian County was damaged, the Shandong Department of Education sent personnel to investigate and transported the remaining books to Jinan for preservation. Subsequently, there was news of the loss of the Great Sutra Collection of Shijia Temple in Jiyang County. The Department of Education again sent the County Education Bureau to investigate nearby. Sutra Collections are a grand spectacle of Chinese documents, and many temples in northern provinces have numerous collections. Shandong also has many Sutra Collections. According to Wang Xiantang, the director of the Shandong Library, Sutra Collections are divided into two types: the Great Sutra (i.e., Buddhist Sutras) and Daoist Sutras. The temples in Shandong mostly preserve Buddhist Sutras, and Daoist Sutras are the fewest. The collection of Hainan Temple in Yexian County is the Ming Dynasty version of the Great Sutra, which has now been transported to the library. Qianfo Temple in Yexian County still has half of the Ming Dynasty version, which is very well preserved. Jiyang has a complete Ming Dynasty version, which is said to have been lost, and is currently under investigation. A private collection of half of the Ming Dynasty version exists on Shunhuang Temple Street in Jinan (it is said that the book owner is named Wu). In addition, Jingju Temple outside the East Gate of Jinan has a complete collection of the new version of the Great Sutra, which was donated by Pan Yunhang. As for Daoist Sutras, the Shandong Library has an incomplete Ming Dynasty version. It is said that Laoshan has a complete Ming Dynasty version, which is very well preserved. According to the Four Libraries Summary, there are four printed versions of the Great Sutra in China: two Chinese versions (Zheng and Xu), one Japanese version, and one Korean version. The Showa Great Sutra currently being printed in Japan is a combined edition of the above four versions.</p>
<p>National Qingdao University sent Bo Jun to Laoshan to investigate the Sutra Collections of Taiqing Palace and Huayan Temple. Ding Jun has already submitted a written report, stating that he inspected the Daoist and Great Sutra Collections of Taiqing Palace and Huayan Temple in Laoshan on May 2nd and 3rd, accompanied by the two deans, Wen and Huang, and inquired about everything. It is said that they are well preserved. According to the Four Libraries Summary, the Daoist Sutras were compiled by Bai Yunjii in the Ming Dynasty and completed in the year of Bingyin of the Tianqi era. Bai's detailed notes on the Daoist Sutra catalog include more than 1,400 types. During the Wanli period, 50 types were added, totaling more than 1,500 types. Now, the collection in the main hall of Taiqing Palace is the edition promulgated by imperial decree in the 35th year of Wanli of the Ming Dynasty. Randomly examining one type, the Panxi Collection, the Wanli year of Wuxu is printed in the dragon pattern at the end of the volume. It is finely printed on Xuan paper and bound in brocade. The promulgated imperial edict is still engraved and stored. According to the abbot, the entire collection has more than 4,000 volumes, which is also mentioned in Ding Shuzhi's Travels in Laoshan, seemingly inconsistent with Bai's catalog. The Great Sutra, located in Huayan Temple, was presented in Beijing in the eighth year of Qianlong and is a printed edition from the early years of Yongzheng. According to the Essentials of Series Books, based on the edition of the Hongjiao Bookstore in Japan, there are a total of 1,916 volumes. The abbot of the temple said that there are more than 700 volumes, and because they are not lent out, they are said to be complete. The Sutra Pavilion also contains many other Sutras. Random checks reveal that most are printed editions from the Zhengtong and Xuande eras, and there are also many Confucian classics, which do not seem to be highly valued. Daoist and Buddhist Sutras are grand spectacles of our country's documents. Few survive, and even fewer are complete. The catalogs of various families generally do not contain detailed information. Yang Shoujing was knowledgeable in various books and was considered the best of his time. The Essentials of Series Books he wrote only covers the Japanese edition of the Great Sutra and only covers the summary of the Daoist Sutras. The Tianqi Bingyin edition does not include the Wanli continuation, so it seems that he did not see the entire collection. Therefore, these two books are almost unique in China, and their value is estimated to be more than hundreds of millions. (May 8)</p>

<p>The National Government Supervisory Yuan previously sent Councilor Shang Wenli to Anhui to investigate the situation of various taxes after the abolition of Likin, and to investigate the 1 million yuan rice and grain public bond recently raised in Anhui Province. Shang stayed in Wuhu for several days and took a boat to Datong on the morning of the 8th, and then went to Anqing from Datong.</p>
<p>The business tax in Anhui Province is still under preparation. Wuhu merchants recently put forward opinions, unanimously requesting: 1. Rice and grain are tax-free goods, and request exemption from taxation. 2. Tobacco, alcohol, kerosene, and flour have already been taxed with special taxes and should be exempted. 3. Firewood and charcoal are essential for people's livelihood and should be allowed to be taxed at a reduced rate. 4. The date of commencement of taxation should be postponed to June 12.</p>
<p>All circles in Wuhu held a National Humiliation Memorial Meeting at the YMCA at 9:00 am on the National Humiliation Memorial Day on May 9th. At the same time, each school sent three speech teams to give speeches in different directions.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Infant Care Center is poorly managed. According to investigations, there are currently 148 infants in the center, of which 34 suffer from internal and external diseases, and even more suffer from scabies. In order to rectify the situation, Lu Tingzhen has been specially promoted to director, and the Public Security Bureau and the County Government have issued notices to attach 1% of the house rent as a subsidy for the center.</p>

<p>County-wide Boy Scout General Review: The Boy Scouts of this county held a three-day large-scale event at the public sports ground yesterday (9th). A total of six troops, totaling 300 people, attended. At 9:00 am today, Ni Han, the director of the Department of Education, the government secretary, and the Zhengwei, etc. served as inspectors and held a solemn ceremony. The Boy Scouts uniforms were bright, the clothing was neat, and their spirit was very brave. The instructors swiftly issued commands, and the review proceeded smoothly. Wang Jikun, a standing committee member, delivered a speech on behalf of the provincial party headquarters. He stated that Boy Scouts must pay attention to thought and action. In terms of thought, there are three main ideas: the Three Principles of the People, Communism, and Nationalism. However, Communism and Nationalism are not central ideas, and we should all concentrate on the ideas of the Three Principles of the People in order to be accurate. Actions must be disciplined and organized in groups so that we can develop a spirit of service. The speech was thorough and the meeting adjourned after the ceremony.</p>

<p>Two Men Commit Suicide Due to Economic Pressure: Zhang Xixian, also known as Genquan, a resident of Shicang outside the South Gate of this county, was 24 years old. He worked as a runner for the Xiechang Oil Company in Shanghai. Recently, Xixian was encouraged by a friend to raise shares and open an oil shop in Chongming County. However, the shop closed down due to losses less than a week after opening. Zhang then returned to Wuxi on the 7th of this month and stayed in room 20 on the upper floor of the Qitai Inn on Tongyun Road, laughing as usual and showing no signs of abnormality. At 9:00 am the day before yesterday (9th), the tea room saw that the guest had not yet gotten up, so he opened the door to check and saw that Zhang Xixian's face was pale and he was lying straight, with only a breath left. He did not respond when called. He realized that he had taken poison and found two empty bottles of "Barbital" sedative pills on the table, as well as two suicide notes. He immediately reported to the accountant and carried him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. After Dr. Zhu's careful acupuncture treatment, his life may be saved. The reason for his suicide was economic pressure. Hui Hanxiang, a resident of Zhoushanbang, used to be a worker. Recently, he has been unemployed at home, which has made his finances extremely tight. Therefore, he suddenly developed a pessimistic view of life and drank five catties of yellow wine and a large bowl of foreign alkaline water yesterday, instantly falling into a daze and losing consciousness. Later, his family noticed and immediately sent him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, which allowed him to turn the corner.</p>
<p>Farmhouse Robbed in the Middle of the Night: In the Dongfang Zhuang Shuiqueli area of Zhangjingqiao, Seventh District (Huai Shangshi), Hu Genyu, a resident who works as a blacksmith, is extremely frugal and has some savings. Recently, he also built a Xieshun silkworm house in Dongfangqiao, which was coveted by bandits. At about 2:00 am the night before last, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came to Hu's house, broke into the house with weapons. At that time, Hu's family, big and small, were awakened from their dreams. After the bandits entered the room, they dragged Hu Genyu off the bed, tied him with hemp rope, and beat him severely, forcing him to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Then they ransacked the house for an hour before packing up the stolen goods, carrying them out the door, and fleeing north. After the incident, the loss was estimated to be about 500 yuan. Yesterday, the victim, Hu Genyu, reported the robbery to the police brigade headquarters, which immediately sent detective Hua Yaoxian to the countryside to investigate and apprehend the stolen goods and bandits.</p>
<p>The Case of the Robbery of Zhucui Shan's House is Solved: Wang Wei, the captain of the county police brigade, received a secret report the day before yesterday stating that He Abing and other robbers who robbed the house of Zhu Xingshan near Zhangjingqiao, Seventh District (Huai Shangshi), were now hiding in the Luozhuang area of the district. He was requested to quickly send a team to arrest them. Captain Wang immediately ordered the detective team leader to lead detectives Hua Yaoxian and Hao Zhiliang to the countryside to arrest them at the address. He Abing was arrested on the spot, escorted to the city, and sent to the brigade headquarters. After Captain Wang's detailed interrogation, the suspect confessed to robbing Zhu Xingshan's house and using the stolen goods. Captain Wang immediately ordered him to be temporarily detained pending transfer to the county for interrogation. Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the water patrol team, and Wang Jinbiao, a special agent, also arrested a suspect, Chen Shengquan (i.e., Chen Shengkui), a remnant of the bandit leader Hang Zupei, who was killed in action, in the Miaoxia area the day before yesterday, and immediately escorted him to the brigade headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Rickshaw Donation Strike is Difficult to Resolve: The rickshaw pullers in Nantong, because various sections of the road have been in disrepair for a long time, and the Construction Bureau has not repaired them, recently suddenly increased donations. More than a thousand people gathered to oppose the donation increase. The county government's persuasion was ineffective, resulting in the stagnation of rickshaw donations from the Construction Bureau for several months. County Magistrate Zhang submitted a report to the department for instructions. On the 9th, he received instructions stating that the rickshaw pullers in the county had united to resist donations and gathered to coerce the Construction Bureau into reorganizing the rickshaw donations and issuing licenses. The department had not investigated the report, which was already particularly tolerant. The request to reduce rickshaw donations should not be discussed. However, the rickshaw pullers regarded road repairs as a prerequisite, and it is difficult</p>

County Magistrate Li inspected the district administration and pacified the area, earnestly persuading the people and requesting Branch Head Huang to apologize to the merchants and residents by setting off firecrackers. The merchants and residents resumed business first, and the matter of how to punish Branch Head Huang is still pending as the merchants and residents have telegraphed the provincial authorities and are awaiting instructions from their superiors. The strike has been temporarily resolved.</p>

<p>The Governor's Office Orders Investigation into Concealing Bandits Case: The Pacification Commissioner's Office received a complaint from Zheng Dechang and Li Liangde, residents of Xiaozheng Village and Shiqiao Village, respectively, located at the border of Pi and Tong Counties. They alleged that Shen Jingzhou, the captain of the Second Squad of the Public Security Bureau, was harboring Li Dunrong, a notorious bandit from Taoyuan Village in Tongshan County, by enlisting him as a soldier in the Seventh Platoon under the alias of Li Feng'e. After the complaint, Pi County captured and detained Li Feng'e. A special order was issued to the Pi County government to investigate whether Li Feng'e was indeed the notorious bandit Li Dunrong using an alias, to promptly summon the plaintiffs for questioning and legal action, and to avoid any concealment or leniency. The handling of the case should be reported. Additionally, Zhou Zhenjun, the district chief of the Twelfth District of Tongshan, and Zhou Daochang, the police captain, also reported to the Governor's Office that Hu Yuquan, the district chief of the First District of Pi County, and Zou Yunliang, the police captain, were suspected of harboring and condoning bandits, leading to the persistent activity of Red Bandits in the area. Yesterday (the 8th), the Pi County Magistrate was instructed to investigate and report back, with a deadline for suppressing the Red Bandits in the region.</p>

<p>Meeting to Maintain the Silk Industry: The silkworm season in the four rural areas of Jiaxing is approaching, but of the hundred or so cocoon factories in the county, only thirteen have decided to open and operate. Therefore, the Department of Construction specifically ordered prompt measures to be taken to help the farmers. County Magistrate Gong convened a meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of the 9th, bringing together silk cocoon merchants, financiers, and key figures from various local chambers of commerce to discuss the matter. The following resolutions were reached: (1) Jiaxing financiers will lend 1 million yuan to facilitate circulation, with a 4-6 split for security, following the usual procedures of previous years. (2) A temporary relief committee for silk cocoons will be formed, and Gu Suming, Qian Boying, Zhang Ximin, Shen Jun, Chu Fucheng, Shen Xiping, Wu Heshuyi, Xi Shinong, and Liang Hua will be appointed as members. (3) The relief committee will request the provincial government to waive all cocoon taxes for this year. (4) Factory rents will be limited to 80 yuan per double stove and 40 yuan per single stove, with existing contracts unaffected. (5) Wu Heshuyi and Liang Hua will be tasked with drafting a concrete plan for establishing a public drying kiln, to be discussed at the first relief committee meeting for silk cocoons on the 13th.</p>

<p>Pirates Plunder and Kidnap People: Around 8:00 PM the other day, over sixty pirates armed with wooden-cased guns arrived in two boats at Zhou Village, Xinyu Zhong Village, Wantang, East Township, Cixi. After landing, they immediately began looting. They first broke into the home of Zhou Guangyu, the village chief, stealing over 1,000 yuan. Next, they robbed the home of Zhou Guangcai, taking over 600 yuan; the home of Shen Wenxing, stealing clothing worth about 100 yuan; the home of Zhou Guangxun, stealing clothing and jewelry worth about 500 yuan; and the home of Zhou Guangzhao, stealing over 200 yuan. Before leaving, they kidnapped the village chief, Zhou Guangyu, and his young son. The looting lasted for three hours before the pirates sailed away towards the East Sea.</p>
<p>Letter Carrier Robbed of Silver Dollars: Ma Chunciao, a letter carrier from Longtai Mound, Fangqiao, Yin County, hired the Ma Shengcai ferry the other day to travel from Ningbo to Miaoyantou. Halfway there, a small boat approached with four bandits on board. They tied up the captain, Ma Heshang, and A Lin, and stole over 900 silver dollars from the letter carrier, Ma Chunciao. After being robbed, the letter carrier immediately returned to Ningbo to report the incident to the Public Security Bureau for investigation, but no arrests have been made.</p>

<p>Fire Used to Warm Silkworms Kills Two Children: A farming family named Gao in Xizhuang, Eastern Township, Xiaoshan, raised a large number of silkworms this year. Due to the cold weather, the early silkworms were about to spin their cocoons, and the family used fire for warmth. Around midnight on the 6th, a fire broke out due to negligence in the silkworm-warming stove, quickly destroying two two-story houses, one one-story house, and two thatched sheds, also burning to death two children, aged five and nine. The next morning, the remains were examined, revealing only the pierced lungs and hearts, a pitiful sight.</p>
<p>Unoptimistic Outlook for the Silkworm Season in the Four Rural Areas: There are over twenty cocoon businesses in Toupeng, Nanyang, and other areas of Xiaoshan, which have been leased to companies such as Hangwei Cheng. After the spring silkworms hatched, the weather changed, and recently, as the silkworms approached the big sleep, the weather remained harsh, with continuous rain and unpredictable temperatures. The silkworms were eating wet leaves and suffering from yellow water disease, and their development was uneven. Currently, most of the early silkworms are ready to spin their cocoons, but the late silkworms are just entering the big sleep. Given this situation, it is possible to predict that this year's cocoon production will not be plentiful. As a result, only seven or eight cocoon businesses have been leased out, and the general mood among silkworm farmers is one of worry.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Jiangsu Middle School Teachers' Union Petitions the National Assembly <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Jiangsu Middle School Teachers' Union has actively worked to reform and revitalize Jiangsu Province. Now, at the opening of the National Assembly, the union has submitted proposals and sent representatives to Beijing to discuss relevant matters. The submitted documents are listed below.</p>
<p>Document to the National Assembly</p>
<p>Regarding the improvement of education in Jiangsu Province, a draft proposal is respectfully submitted for consideration by the Assembly. We believe that education is the foundation of the nation, the source of vitality, and the determinant of talent and cultural prosperity. Therefore, education should advance with the times, and educational funding should increase annually. With sufficient funding, the education system can be effectively promoted and achieve significant results. According to the Party's program, educational funding should be increased and its independence guaranteed. As the period of political tutelage nears completion and constitutional government is about to begin, the development of education is a matter of utmost urgency for the well-being of the Party's governance and the flourishing of culture. Jiangsu Province is prosperous and populous, and its educational and cultural achievements are among the best in the nation. It now serves as the national capital and the center of the country, and its institutions are closely watched both domestically and internationally. Therefore, it is essential to expand and improve Jiangsu's education system to set an example for the rest of the country and showcase its achievements to the world. The importance of Jiangsu's position and the need to expand and improve its education system cannot be ignored. However, after examining the current state of education in Jiangsu Province, we find that since the reorganization in the sixteenth year of the Republic, the system has suffered a loss of vitality due to the disruptions of the university district system, and its strength has been undermined by the burden of funding the National Central University. Music education continues, but only in form, and the spirit is weary and exhausted. The financial situation is dire and unsustainable. If this continues, not only will it be difficult to achieve new standards, but previous accomplishments may be lost. This is not only a crisis for education in Jiangsu Province but also a threat to the well-being of the nation. We, who are members of the education community in Jiangsu Province, have experienced this firsthand and feel deeply concerned. As your esteemed Assembly opens, we hope that the representatives will engage in insightful discussions and develop grand strategies to benefit the nation and its people. While there are many aspects to consider, the cultivation of culture and academics is a fundamental priority for the nation. Therefore, we hope that the representatives will carefully consider how to expand the education system, increase educational funding, encourage teachers, and improve administration. As the capital of the nation, Jiangsu Province should set a national example. Based on our sincerity, we dare not remain silent. We respectfully offer our humble suggestions as a small contribution. We hereby submit a proposal for improving education in Jiangsu Province. We respectfully request that it be reviewed and approved for submission to the General Assembly for discussion and to establish a clear direction for improving education in Jiangsu Province. We are deeply grateful for your consideration. Respectfully submitted to the National Assembly by Wu Zixiu, Zhang Zhongyou, Wu Dezhang, Zhang Kaixuan, Wu Cangsu, Chen Yue, Xue Jianwu, and 1,006 other faculty members of Jiangsu provincial secondary schools.</p>
<p>Petition Proposals</p>
<p>1.  Increase educational funding for Jiangsu Province and ensure its independence. (Reason) In the thirteenth year of the Republic, Jiangsu Province established a special cigarette tax fund for education, collected directly by educational institutions and completely separate from other financial tax revenues. This established Jiangsu's educational funding independence, setting an example for the entire country. However, in the sixteenth year of the Republic, the national government nationalized the cigarette tax and allocated 1.8 million yuan from the province's land tax revenues to compensate. As land tax revenues fluctuate with the harvest, the actual funds received were less than promised, fundamentally undermining Jiangsu's educational funding. From the sixteenth year to the present, counties have accumulated over 2 million yuan in unpaid educational funds. The budget is merely a formality, and loans are not being repaid. Maintaining the current situation is already a challenge, let alone improving and expanding. Even if this limited amount could be fully allocated to Jiangsu's education system, it would barely be enough. However, the national government also assigned Jiangsu the responsibility of funding the National Central University, requiring the province to contribute over 1.3 million yuan annually, which constitutes more than one-third of Jiangsu's total educational funds. This has deprived Jiangsu of its funding sources and increased its financial burden. This is not only unfair compared to other provinces but also contradicts the Ministry of Finance's principle of using provincial taxes to fund provincial schools and national taxes to fund national schools. As a result, Jiangsu bears the empty title of educational funding independence while suffering the actual harm of being cut off and exploited. This year, schools in various provinces have been in session for four months, but Jiangsu has only received one month's worth of funding. The situation is dire. If no remedies are found, the national capital and its leading national and provincial schools will all suffer. We hereby propose two solutions: reducing expenditures and increasing revenue, for your consideration. A. Reduce Expenditures: (1) Eliminate the burden of funding the National Central University. According to the current financial principles of the national government's Ministry of Finance, provincial taxes should fund provincial schools, and national taxes should fund national schools. Therefore, we request that the annual funding of over 1.3 million yuan for the National Central University be shifted to the national tax budget and directly allocated by the Ministry of Finance, thereby relieving Jiangsu's burden and allowing for some expansion. (2) Thoroughly reform the Jiangsu Educational Funding Management Office. The Jiangsu Educational Funding Management Office is responsible for the overall management of educational funding in Jiangsu Province. Strict performance evaluations should be implemented, and a director of the supervisory office should be appointed, with the candidate selected by the education community and appointed by the provincial government. The internal structure of the office should be streamlined, with fewer redundant positions. Supervision should be strengthened, and audits should be thorough. Only in this way can performance be improved and funds be spent wisely. Currently, the director of the management office holds a nominal position and does not handle office affairs personally, leading to an excessive number of redundant staff and widespread corruption. This has caused various rumors and criticisms. As the office is not subject to performance evaluations by the provincial government or oversight by community organizations, the annual waste of funds is likely significant. We request that the Jiangsu Educational Funding Management Office be thoroughly reformed to eliminate waste. B. Increase Revenue: (1) Allocate a percentage of the cigarette tax to compensate for the shortfall in land tax revenues, thereby maintaining Jiangsu's educational funding. On July 2, the sixteenth year of the Republic, members of the Central Executive Committee Wu Zhihui, Li Shizeng, Cai Zimin, and Zhang Jingjiang, along with former Minister of Finance Gu Yingfen and former President of National Central University Zhang Junmou, reached an agreement stating, "If the funds allocated from land tax revenues to educational expenses in each county are insufficient, the Ministry of Finance will allocate the necessary funds from cigarette tax revenues." Currently, the unpaid land tax revenues for education in various counties have reached 2 million yuan over the past three years, while cigarette tax revenues have increased to 10 million yuan. We request that the Ministry of Finance fulfill the original agreement and allocate a percentage of the increased cigarette tax revenues each month to Jiangsu's educational funding. (2) Recover and effectively manage the public forests owned by the Jiangsu Educational Corps to increase production and supplement the province's educational foundation. The establishment of public forests in Jiangsu Province was originally intended to cultivate a foundation for education in the province. Therefore, the operating expenses were initially funded by savings from the regular expenses of various provincial schools. These forests were carefully managed in Jiangpu Laojun for over ten years, and have always been considered as an asset of Jiangsu education. Following the principle of planting trees for ten years, the forests' yields have increased. However, since the reorganization, management has been unclear, and there has been a lack of effective management. Recently, management has been transferred to the Forestry Bureau of the Agricultural and Mining Department. The assets of Jiangsu education have been neglected and encroached upon. We should try to recover and manage these forests, or else sell the property rights at a reasonable price, so the educational funding will slightly increase. (3) Allocate a percentage of the Jiangsu Province's business tax revenues to educational funding. Jiangsu Province's business tax is levied on the developed industry and commerce, so tax revenue will be huge. We request that a percentage of the business tax revenues be allocated annually to Jiangsu's educational funding. Those who take from Jiangsu, must give back to Jiangsu. Because the people of Jiangsu fulfill the obligation of paying tax, the right to receive education, must be planned.</p>
<p>2.  Improve the treatment of elementary and secondary school teachers in Jiangsu Province and give them better protection. (Reason) The cost of living continues to rise, especially rapidly in Jiangsu Province in recent years. Educational work is a profession, but the current salary is low, and teachers work diligently all year round. Not enough money to make a living. There is no guarantee for old age, sickness or death, so increasing treatment standard is not enough to maintain a living. Definite protection rules can not give enough incentives. The following methods are used:</p>
<p>(Method) A. Increasing hourly fees. Currently, the salary of secondary school teachers in other provinces is better than in Jiangsu Province. Near by Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian can be used as reference. Because of educational fund shortage in Jiangsu Province, hopes can not be over extended. It is suggested that the monthly salary should be 9 yuan for each hour of teaching in senior high school, and 7 yuan for each hour of teaching in junior high school. This is the lowest limit. This is still less than in other provinces. The monthly salary of staffs, should also be incrementally increased. The standard is being able to work at ease and maintain a living. B. Enact seniority-based salary increase system. Research is central to education. Length of service increases experience and knowledge. Enacting seniority-based salary increases, can relieve living hardships and increase interest in working. It directly benefits the lives of individual and indirectly increases the efficiency of education. C. Children can attend school for free. Secondary school teachers work hard but earn little. They are often unable to afford their children's education because of financial difficulties. There for they loyal to others but struggling to take care of themselves. We should stipulate that all provincial secondary schools will waive tuition and accommodation fees for the children of secondary school teachers, showing respect to teachers. It not only a good rule for teachers, but also show the nation's intention to nurture talent. D. Promulgate regulations on pension and retirement benefits. Teachers serve the society with education as a profession and work hard throughout the year, unable to rest, and have no support for old age, illness, death. Remembering past contributions, the situation is very pitiful. We should clearly stipulate that honoring the old and respecting the wise is also a political achievement of the nation. E. Equip teachers' residences. Teachers are hired from all over the place. At the end of each semester, traveling back and forth on boats and cars, wastes time. Courses and affairs are affected. It is costly for local teacher to come and go from nearby school site. Therefore, schools need to have teachers' residences, teachers can feel more comfortable and work with concentration.</p>
<p>3.  Actively promote academic research, cultivate teachers, and improve educational efficiency. (Reason) Most of the faculty members of provincial schools are graduates of universities or specialized schools at home and abroad. They have their own basic knowledge and long-term expertise. Academic research needs to keep up with the times, and more educational teachers should be cultivated. At present, due to limited funds, schools can hardly conduct research activities except for teaching according to chapters and lessons. They are sticking to old ways and culture is falling behind. They are blindly building cars, and more application may be rejected. We should promote academic research to advance culture and pay attention to the cultivation of teachers to innovate education. The following methods are used: A. Stipulate regulations on foreign visits for teachers. After provincial school teachers have served for several years, they should be sent to study in Europe and the United States at public expense in order to improve or sent to foreign countries for visits. They can then use their knowledge to innovate, so that the efficiency of education can be improved day by day. B. Schools should allocate academic research fees and domestic visit fees when preparing the budget. In addition to teaching, various sciences should have deep research and be mutually observed. This will advance education. Current provincial school budgets do not include research fees or domestic visit fees except for salaries and office expenses, so they should be added. C. Hold academic seminars in the summer to develop science and education. Various academic seminars are very popular in Europe, America, and Japan in the summer, so the effectiveness of promoting academic research is significant. Although summer schools are held in various parts of our country, they are limited to the training of young students and lack specialized research in specialized sciences, so there is no opportunity for secondary school teachers to make up for their training. We should organize summer seminars and invite famous scholars from China and abroad to give lectures by division, so that teachers can have a chance to develop their knowledge.</p>
<p>4.  Choose wise and capable people carefully, refresh administration, respect teachers, and rectify academic style. Good law must have good personnel and good personnel must have good law. Therefore administration needs to be emphasized. In education, academics should be the focus. Administrative personnel must be reputable in the education community, so they can bring together ideas, do deliberate planning, and use talent. If only people are good at books, signing, running errands, they would flatter those above and look down on those below. Educational offices will be militarized. If academics politicized, then not only will the administration be a state of disarray, but also education will go bankrupt. There will be no standard to abide by. This will cause the province's education to be used to relying on others. The spirit of scholars will be weakened, and the style of learning will be corrupted. I am afraid for the future. We should choose wise and capable people carefully, respect teachers, and rectify academic style in order to increase the efficiency of education and to cultivate the nation's energy.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Santo Tomas Basketball Team Defeats East-West Last Night <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>丨Fifty-Five to Thirty-Four丨The Performance Receives Acclaim Throughout the Arena丨</p>
<p>Departing for Japan Today丨Scheduled to Return to Shanghai on June 12th</p>
<p>The Santo Tomas University basketball team from Manila, Philippines, renowned in the Far East, passed through Shanghai on the Russian Empress last night at 7 PM on their way to a competition in Japan. They depart for Japan today at 9 AM. The Chinese Athletic Association specially invited them to perform a demonstration game, which began at 8:30 PM against the East-West team at the Chinese Basketball Hall. Living up to their reputation, the team defeated the East-West team with their outstanding skills and captivating performance. The score was 55 to 34. The referee was Shen Siliang.</p>
<p>Full Team Roster: Coach Carver, Manager Sevilla, Captain De Rosario, Players Mariano, Silva, Montinola, Jacinto, Villanueva, Biel, Heredia, Reyes, Amayo.</p>
<p>Far Eastern Champions: Four of the ten players are representatives of the Philippine Far Eastern Games basketball team, and are highly acclaimed. The four are Mariano, De Rosario, Jacinto, and Villanueva. Jacinto, the guard, is considered the number one in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Record in the Philippines: This year, the team has fought forty-nine battles, both big and small, in the Philippines, and have been victorious in every one. In the last battle, they lost to the Philippine All-Star team by only one point, with the final score being 42 to 43. In the last three minutes of this game, Santo Tomas was still leading with 42 to 37, but unfortunately, the All-Star team was composed purely of famous Far Eastern athletes from the Philippines, such as Padilla, Salvador, and Schlodohm, all of whom are past Far Eastern athletes from the Philippines.</p>
<p>Motivation for Going to Japan: This trip to Japan is purely voluntary, and Japan has expressed extreme welcome. Japan's recent progress in basketball cannot be measured by ordinary standards, so the team decided to go to Japan for observation. The expenses will be covered by 60% of the ticket sales.</p>
<p>Schedule in Japan: It is planned that there will be a total of eleven matches in Japan. Six matches against the Tokyo Six Universities, two matches against the Osaka Two University teams, two matches against the Two Combined teams, and one match against the Nagoya University team, totaling eleven matches.</p>
<p>Scheduled Return to Shanghai: The team is scheduled to depart for Japan tomorrow at 9 AM on the original ship. They will stay in Japan for twenty-one days and will leave Japan around June 6th, returning to Shanghai around June 12th.</p>
<p>Last Night's Performance: The team's skill last night was praised by all present. They were as light as swallows, not tall but jumping like flying. Every dribble was under their perfect control. Nimble as monkeys, their movements were extremely difficult to predict. Accurate shooting was their forte. Their collaboration was seamless. The communication of the three forwards was sophisticated. The guards were capable of effective support. The substitutes were also all talented players. It was beautiful, it was perfect.</p>
<p>Leadership's Criticism: Santo Tomas coach Carver, who was also a former Far Eastern athlete in the Philippines, told reporters yesterday that the individual skills of the East-West team could be considered not bad. Players like Lu Zhongen, Liang Guoquan, and Wang Xiliang are all outstanding. However, their cooperation is far from satisfactory, and their movements are very slow, giving the opponents time to prepare, which is also a weakness. The forwards attack, but the rear cannot provide support, so many shots rely on individual skills, and the shooting is not accurate. Wen Dingxin is relatively weak in this aspect. In defense, they cannot strictly defend each person, resulting in neglecting the east and losing the west, giving the enemy opportunities. Their team uses five-person defense, and the attack and defense are consistent, which is why they won. It seems that the Chinese team has very little practice time. The failure in the Far East was also due to insufficient preparation compared to Japan, resulting in a disastrous defeat. His words were quite pertinent, worthy of an expert.</p>
<p>Overall Review: The skill was simply divine. After the referee blew the whistle, the center Montinola jumped and tapped the ball, Silva caught it, and after two passes by the guards, it landed in Mariano's hands, who shot and scored immediately, in just a few dozen seconds. The entire arena exclaimed in admiration. Lu Zhongen also scored a basket to show he was not to be outdone. Wen Dingxin scored again, at which time they were leading 4 to 3. Unexpectedly, after that, the Santo Tomas's shots continued to go in, making the score 11 to 4, then 15 to 6. The Chinese team then made a great effort, with Liang Guoquan and Wen Dingxin scoring eight points, chasing the score to 17 to 14, only two points behind. Santo Tomas then substituted Heredia in, and their momentum increased again. The first half ended with 24 to 18, East-West being six points behind. From the start of the second half, the East-West team declined sharply. Wen Dingxin was injured, and Ouyang Yongyuan and Li Baojun were of no help. Finally, they lost with 55 to 24.

I fear that if a dispute arises, the flames of war will reignite, and the cause of unification and peace will once again be a mere illusion. I pace restlessly, unable to sleep or find peace. If civil war is truly unavoidable, it will only create an opportunity for the Communist bandits, leading to the demise of the Party and the nation. Any personal sacrifice is insignificant in comparison. After repeated consideration, if it benefits the Party and the nation, I am willing to face any hardship. I can no longer shirk the responsibility of mediation. I plan to follow Zhishi, Jing, Yong, and other gentlemen to the capital to directly address Chiang Kai-shek," and other such words.</p>

<p>Zhengda and Hanping Collide</p>
<p>Accident Occurred Near Tongzhou the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Both Damaged But Still Sailed Out Yesterday</p>
<p>Passengers Unharmed, Cargo Damaged</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Zhengda ship of Datong Company and the Hanping ship of Dada Company collided near Longjusha, Xintang, the day before yesterday (the 9th) due to heavy fog. Although the passengers were unharmed, both ships were damaged. The most significant loss among the cargo was fresh eggs, estimated at over 3,600 pieces. Details of the situation are described below:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Collision: Both the Zhengda and Hanping ships departed from Yangzhou on the morning of the 8th at 10:00 AM. The Zhengda ship was faster than the Hanping. On the 9th, the Zhengda ship was sailing towards Longjusha in Xintang, about seventy or eighty li from Tongzhou, at 3:55 AM. Due to sudden changes in the weather, a thick fog enveloped the area, making it impossible to see even a short distance. It immediately dropped anchor. Around 5:00 AM, the Hanping ship sailed through the waves, approaching Longjusha. It sounded its whistle and prepared to drop anchor at the same location. Suddenly, it heard the chaotic ringing of a bell ahead, realizing that a ship was anchored there. The helmsman was ordered by the second pilot to steer to the right, but the tide was too strong to maneuver. The Zhengda ship's pilot saw the Hanping ship approaching and immediately raised the anchor chain and quickly reversed to avoid it, but it was too late. With a loud crash, the keel of the Zhengda ship broke, and the iron plates cracked. It was temporarily repaired with cloth bags, and the ship barely managed to sail to Shanghai. The Hanping ship had a large hole in its side, but fortunately, it was not seriously damaged and was still able to sail to Shanghai. However, the passengers on both ships were quite frightened.</p>
<p>History of Zhengda and Hanping: The Zhengda ship of Datong Company was built by the Da Zhonghua Shipyard, using a German Meng'am diesel engine, with a load capacity of 1,000 tons. It was launched in July of the 19th year and operated to Yangzhou. The Hanping ship of Dada Company originally belonged to the Hanyeping Ironworks and had a load capacity of over 1,000 tons. It was over ten years old. Later, the factory owed sand taxes to the Hubei Provincial Government and used the ship as collateral. At the end of the 18th year, the provincial government leased it to the Shanghai Yicheng Shipping Company, which operated the Shanghai-Hankou route. In July of the 19th year, Yicheng Company subleased it to Dada Company, changing its route to Yangzhou. Except for the pilot, the captain and crew were not changed.</p>
<p>Losses of Both Ships: Both the Zhengda and Hanping ships arrived in Shanghai around 3:00 PM on the 9th. After investigation, it was found that all 3,460 pieces of fresh eggs on the Zhengda ship, including 1,600 pieces from Maochang, 1,800 pieces from Banda, 100 pieces from Xiehe, 300 pieces from Haining, and 200 pieces from Yihegong, each containing 800 eggs, were broken. The damaged parts of the ship will be inspected by the Da Zhonghua, Ruirong, and Nanyang shipyards. It is estimated that the repair cost will be over 10,000 taels and will take at least twenty days. It should have been docked for repairs immediately, but due to a prior agreement with Catholic devotees to worship the Virgin Mary at Langshan, Tongzhou, it barely managed to sail that evening at 12:00 AM. It will be docked for repairs after returning to Shanghai. The Hanping ship has a large hole in its side, but it is not seriously damaged, so it still sailed to Yangzhou that evening at 12:00 AM. It will also be repaired after returning to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Pier Five Resumes Normal Work</p>
<p>Organizes a Bonus Campaign Committee</p>
<p>The staff and workers of the CMSNC's No. 5 Pier had no benefits at all from the bonus issued by Li Zhonggong when he left office. Furthermore, they received only a promissory note for their salary arrears in August of last year, which triggered a collective petition to the company. The acting general manager, Song Shuqiao, avoided meeting with them, and the head of the administrative department, Lu Qinghai, made irresponsible perfunctory remarks. The head of the business department, Shen Zhongyi, and the manager of the fourth depot, Sun Jingxiang, made even more excuses, leading to a stalemate. When the No. 5 depot workers began to strike, Shen and Sun became alarmed and invited Yu Xianting, the standing director of the workers' union, to the company for discussions. To protect the overall situation, both parties agreed that Shen and Sun would be responsible for the bonus issue, and they would request the new general manager to achieve this goal. The promissory note for the salary arrears in August will be converted into cash within one or two days. On the other hand, Yu Xianting would be responsible for persuading all the workers to resume work. Therefore, the workers' union convened a meeting that night, and most of the members still insisted on continuing the strike. However, after Yu's earnest explanation and in view of General Manager Guo's imminent assumption of office, they decided that the No. 5 Pier workers would immediately resume normal work and organize a bonus campaign committee to take charge of the process.</p>

<p>Prepares to Implement the Factory Law</p>
<p>Dispatches Staff to Inspect Factories Separately</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, in preparation for the implementation of the Factory Law and its implementing regulations, which the National Government has approved to take effect from August 1, has dispatched staff to various factories for inspection. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with Wang Gang, deputy director of the inspection division of the Third Department of the Bureau of Social Affairs, yesterday. He stated that the focus of the factory inspections is on the management and treatment of workers. The focus of the factory surveys conducted by the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the Ministry of Industry, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Transportation University Research Institute, and the Economics Society is on industrial manufacturing aspects, such as raw materials, outputs, and operating machinery. Therefore, the two are actually completely different. The procedure for inspecting factories uses a triplicate notification form. The above-mentioned notification form and the factory's required preparations are sent to the factory in advance. At the designated time, the inspector will hand over the second copy of the notification form to the factory for inspection. It is currently observing various cotton spinning factories.</p>

<p>Request Suppression of Communist Bandits in Qian and Guang Prefectures</p>
<p>The fellow townsmen's association of the seven counties of Guangxin telegraphed the authorities in Beijing and Jiangxi, stating: "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Director He, and Chairman Lu, Fang Zhimin, Shao Wuping, Huang Dao, and other Communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi, recently besieged by the National Army on all sides, and with their food supply cut off, are difficult to sustain. They suddenly led four to five thousand bandits (approximately three thousand armed with rifles and four machine guns) on April 26th to cross the river in the White Sand area of Shangrao by night, passing through the Shixi area of Qianshan, where they were defeated and driven back by the Hu Regiment. They then went to Shitang via Jiudu, Houda, below Tianzhu Rock, pillaging and killing along the way. The devastation is difficult to describe. After arriving in Shitang on the 27th, the district regiments and merchant corps were unable to resist due to their weakness, and either died or fled. District Regiment Chief Ren Fuhan was brutally murdered. The Fang bandits then intercepted all the important locations on all sides, and the merchants in the city were left to be slaughtered. District Chief Zeng Xingsan and wealthy merchants, both men and women, were mostly abducted, with many being brutally killed on the spot. No store, whether large or small, was spared. The losses in Shitang amounted to no less than several million, truly a great catastrophe. On the 29th, the Fang bandits entered Wenlin Pass from Shitang, and a portion entered Chong'an County, Fujian Province, via Heshangping into Fenwater Pass, approximately using the mountains on the Jiangxi-Fujian border as their nest. The local bandit Wang Mingui of Shitang, Qianshan, began to plunder and pillage ten li outside the city in Qidu on the day the Hu Regiment returned to Hekou, and has recently become even more rampant. Wang's banditry has not been eradicated, and now it is further compounded by the large force of Fang and Shao hiding along the Fujian border, forming a desperate alliance. The situation in Qianshan is unimaginable. Fang and Shao's bandits have been entrenched in Yiheng for over two years, amassing losses and destroying counties, and the three counties of Gui, Yi, and Heng have become a desolate wasteland, a heartbreaking sight. Now that Fang and Shao's bandits have changed their direction, using the Fujian border of Qianshan and Guangfeng counties as their base, the suppression will be even more difficult than before. The two counties of Qian and Guang will become the continuation of Yiheng. The thought of it sends chills down the spine. Xu Xun and others are heartbroken for their hometown and dare not remain silent. They have detailed the facts and tearfully reported, earnestly begging you to order the dispatch of elite troops to Qianshan to encircle and thoroughly suppress the bandits, eradicating them completely, and to request that the Fujian Provincial Government dispatch troops to launch a fierce attack, annihilating them in the shortest possible time. This is the tearful plea of the people of Guangxin. Your Excellencies, with your compassion for the suffering, will surely heed the voice of the people, dispatch elite troops, and set a time limit for the suppression. Guangxin will be fortunate, and the Party and the nation will be fortunate. We cannot express our gratitude enough. Xu Xun, Guo Tong, and Liu Lianghan, Standing Committee members of the Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association of the seven counties of Guangxin, bow in supplication, "Best regards."</p>

<p>Requests Anhui Provincial Government to Protect Cocoon Merchants</p>
<p>Huang Yunchen, chairman of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Guild, yesterday submitted a memorial to Chairman Chen of the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting additional military police to protect the cocoon market, stating: "Memorial for the protection of the cocoon market, advance preparations with reference to previous years' memoranda, respectfully requesting investigation and approval, ordering all subordinates to strictly defend and protect, in order to secure agricultural commerce. Investigate that every new cocoon crop is successively opened to the market during the Xiaoman solar term. Every year, the general guild drafts and presents protection measures, which are presented to the National Government, distributed to all provinces and regions, and circulated for protection, and printed protection measures are presented to Your Excellency for distribution to all cocoon-producing areas for investigation and handling, so as to provide thorough protection, and we are deeply grateful. The cocoon market is approaching this year, and the bandits in various parts of Anhui Province have not been completely cleared. With the new cocoons coming to market, precautions should be complete, and the cocoon trading locations are mostly in rural towns. Farmers bring cocoons to the exchanges, and cocoon merchants bring silver to buy cocoons. The roads and the locations of the exchanges must have substantial protection to avoid fear and seek safety. The general guild has a responsibility to prepare in advance, detailing all aspects that require protection, such as the transport of silver and the transfer of cocoon bales, with reference to past practices and noting the dates. We respectfully request Your Excellency to preside over the matter and earnestly distribute it to all cocoon-producing counties, quickly ordering all stationed regiments and all county water and land public security bureaus to protect and implement it in accordance with the regulations. In addition to printing and distributing the detailed measures, we are sending one hundred additional copies to Your Excellency's government for distribution to all cocoon-producing counties and the military police chiefs responsible for protection for investigation and implementation. All the reasons for the advance petition for protection of the cocoon market, with the attached measures, are hereby submitted. May we be granted investigation and implementation, and may the instructions be followed, for the public good. Respectfully presented."</p>

<p>Request for Allocation of Construction Bonds</p>
<p>Telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Finance and Construction Bureaus</p>
<p>The United Association of Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Industry Guilds in this city yesterday sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Finance and Construction Bureaus, requesting the allocation of construction bonds to relieve the cocoon industry crisis. The text reads:</p>
<p>To the Zhejiang Finance Bureau: Respected Director of the Zhejiang Finance Bureau, since the sales of Chinese silk to Europe have been sluggish, the cocoon industry has been affected accordingly. No one is renting cocoon exchanges, and silk factories are watching the market before purchasing cocoons. There are no fewer than a thousand cocoon exchanges in Zhejiang Province. The time for new cocoons to enter the market is only ten days away, but less than one-tenth of those preparing to obtain licenses and operate are ready. Cocoon exchanges are responsible for managing cocoons, purchasing farmers' produce, and raw silk materials, bearing the mission of production, sales, supply, and demand. The responsibility is extremely heavy. If relief is not arranged quickly, it will not be a matter of great importance to the individual cocoon exchanges but will have a significant impact on the rural economy. The reason for the decline is that the losses last year were huge, and businesses are unable to continue operating. The association has repeatedly convened meetings of the industry to discuss relief methods. It is the consensus that only by requesting assistance from the government and providing large loans can the situation be maintained. In addition to telegraphing the Construction Bureau to forward the request to the Ministry of Industry to allocate 1.5 million yuan from the 2 million yuan of silk industry bonds for the improvement of sericulture, we are sincerely afraid that it will be too slow to be effective. Moreover, according to statistics from all cocoon exchanges in the province, the amount is still insufficient. Therefore, we propose consulting with the Construction Bureau to temporarily approve the allocation of 2 million yuan from the 7 million yuan of unsold construction bonds in the province for the relief of the cocoon industry. The method is to issue them to the county governments of each county, which will then transfer them to local banks or money shops, allowing cocoon merchants to seek guarantees for borrowing. They will be required to repay within a short period of time. In this transition, uselessness can be transformed into usefulness. The government will not suffer any loss, while the people will benefit greatly. Moreover, using it for the construction of industry in the name of construction is more appropriate than other uses. At this time of the cocoon industry crisis, which is on the verge of collapse, we also ask you to promptly and clearly announce the exemptions from the regular and additional donations levied on dried cocoons, and to instruct the counties not to establish other items of collection. If any similar cocoon donations are collected again, merchants and people will clearly understand the government's active assistance and relief, encourage themselves to continue working, and our cocoon industry may still have a day of revitalization. The situation is urgent, and we respectfully ask you to consider and implement it.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>For your consideration, furthermore, cocoon merchants from various regions are gathering in Shanghai to negotiate cocoon sales and lease matters. For the convenience of handling affairs, an office has been established in Shanghai, which is hereby reported together. The Preparatory Committee of the United Association of Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Industry Guilds bows respectfully.</p>
<p>To the Zhejiang Construction Bureau: Respected Director Shi of the Zhejiang Construction Bureau, the silkworm season has arrived early, and the cocoon market is about to open. There are no fewer than a thousand cocoon exchanges in the province, but less than one-tenth have decided to operate. On the 3rd of this month, the association held its fourth preparatory meeting. According to the reports of the representatives of the various guilds present, out of 107 cocoon exchanges in Jiaxing County, less than 10 have decided to operate. Out of 58 in Haiyan, only 4 have decided to operate. Out of 28 in Pinghu, only 7 have decided to operate. The reports from the counties of Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Huzhou are mostly the same. The decline of the cocoon industry has reached an extreme state. If relief is not sought quickly, not only will all cocoon exchanges go bankrupt, but rural households will have difficulty selling their cocoons, and many will become moths and rot, turning usefulness into uselessness, affecting cocoon production to a great extent. The livelihood of farmers in the province, in addition to agricultural income, depends largely on silkworm farming. Rent and taxes, food and clothing, all depend on it. Once livelihoods are sharply reduced, the people of Zhejiang, who have suffered from disasters and famines for a long time, how can they bear this? Upon investigation, the 2 million yuan in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Bonds for the improvement of sericulture is not an immediate need. We earnestly request that you consider the close relationship between the interests of the cocoon industry and the silkworm farmers and approve the forwarding of a request to the Ministry of Industry to allocate 1.5 million yuan as a measure to shift from slow to urgent, and temporarily allocate it for the relief of the Zhejiang cocoon industry. Once approved, please issue it to the county governments of each county and temporarily issue it to local banks or money shops, allowing the cocoon exchanges to seek guarantees for borrowing to facilitate turnover. Directly, it is to relieve the cocoon industry; indirectly, it is to relieve the farmers. In addition to recommending representatives Chu Huiseng, Xu Xingbin, and Huang Weisang to go to the province to petition and discuss the methods in person, we first telegraph this request. We respectfully ask you to consider and implement it. It will be a great favor. Furthermore, cocoon merchants from various regions are gathering in Shanghai to negotiate cocoon sales and lease matters. For the convenience of handling affairs, an office has been established in Shanghai, which is hereby reported together. The Preparatory Committee of the United Association of Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Industry Guilds bows respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Sand and Gravel Industry <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Petition to Abolish the Production Tax</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Sand and Gravel Industry Guild in this city, unable to bear the heavy production tax, has submitted a petition to the authorities, which reads: Submitting a petition for the abolition of arbitrarily established names and the imposition of exorbitant taxes, to alleviate the people's difficulties and alleviate the merchants' hardships. The sand and mud sold by the guild are essentially taking waste materials and benefiting the people's livelihood, and can also dredge rivers and waterways. The selling price is two yuan per ton, which is not a material value but a substitute for labor costs. The firms that fill in the forms and sell them also deduct a commission of only one jiao per ton. Therefore, it has been the practice for decades that the government has been generous and has not levied taxes. Unexpectedly, at this time of tax reduction, our industry is being levied a heavy tax, reaching more than 50%, exceeding the business tax by more than 200 times. Arbitrarily established names such as management fees and production taxes are used to set up branch checkpoints, threatening and extorting donations, which are trapping the common people and infringing on commerce. After the National Government abolished the likin tax and replaced it with a business tax, it repeatedly issued circular telegrams to the whole country, announcing that no other exorbitant taxes should be collected in addition to the business tax, to eliminate accumulated abuses and benefit the people. Moreover, the sand and gravel we collect has already been paid for the production price to the local authorities, and donations have been made for education and police expenses. Furthermore, removing sand and mud can eliminate the siltation of the river channels, so there is no need for management, and the price cannot be repeatedly collected. This is obviously a false claim by unscrupulous merchants to deceive and profit. If this trend is started, others will follow suit, which will have a significant impact on commerce. After celebrating the abolition of the likin tax, we are again suffering from exorbitant taxes. If the industry suffers such a heavy burden, the livelihoods of 40,000 to 50,000 people in the city who rely on it will be in a desperate situation. Therefore, we urgently submit this petition, requesting that the government approve the abolition of this exorbitant tax to alleviate the people's difficulties and alleviate the merchants' hardships. It will be a public benefit. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>Regulations for the Transportation of Dangerous Goods by the Military</p>
<p>Since the tragic accident of the Daji Steamer of the Dada Company, it has aroused the attention of the whole country. The Shanghai Shipping Guild has recently received instructions from the Ministry of Communications to formulate regulations for soldiers carrying gunpowder, explosives, and other items in the future to prevent such incidents. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Instructions: To Whom It May Concern, regarding the Ministry of Communications' Order No. 1670, approved by the Ministry of Military Affairs' consultation, approved by the Ministry of Finance's Order No. 18781, approved by the Customs Administration's presentation, according to the Chief Commissioner of Customs' presentation, according to the Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs' report, the Dada Company's Daji Steamer caught fire and was burned on the evening of March 11 in the Dashudun area of the Yangtze River due to the explosion of gunpowder on board. The Customs' special patrol boat and the Dahe Steamer rushed to the rescue, rescuing a total of 191 people and transporting them to Shanghai. The cause of the ship's accident and the observations are respectfully submitted to you. The ship was heading to Tongzhou and Yangzhou on March 10. When it left Shanghai, it carried a total of 537 passengers. When the ship arrived in Tongzhou, a large number of passengers disembarked. At that time, there were some passengers, and 41 soldiers carrying guns, ammunition, and hand grenades boarded the ship from Tongzhou. Therefore, when the ship left Tongzhou, the total number of passengers, including soldiers, was 356. The cause of the accident was that the soldiers did not place the ammunition they were carrying in a safe place, and it was reported that some gunpowder was not properly placed, so when the remnants of cigarettes were thrown and approached the ammunition, a tragedy occurred. The above-mentioned circumstances of the case are deeply hoped that all parties will pay attention to. The military's carrying of dangerous goods on passenger ships not only disregards the safety of passengers, but also ignores the danger to themselves, and arbitrarily places the explosives they carry on the ship. Although the crew members warned them, they ignored them. This situation is known to all and is prone to danger. Therefore, according to the Commissioner of Customs' observation, the dispatch of troops by ship is a constant occurrence, but there must be regulations for the storage of dangerous goods by the military, which must be strictly observed. In the future, the troops attached to passenger ships will not have similar tragedies. The cause of the Daji Steamer's accident and the reasons for the observations are in line with the Port Captain's report on the Daji Steamer and the report of the surveyor who previously inspected the ship. They are submitted together for review. The details of the report are factual, and the attached reports are attached together. The details are prepared and submitted for review, and forwarded to the Ministry of Military Affairs to order the military officers in charge to pay close attention to the dangerous goods such as explosives carried by the troops in the future when they are dispatched and attached to passenger ships, so as to avoid similar tragedies and ensure safety and maintain the shipping industry. Two attached reports are attached. According to this, the cause of the tragic accident of the Daji Steamer was that the soldiers on board did not place the ammunition they were carrying in a safe place, and when they encountered the remnants of cigarettes, they caused a very serious disaster. If the military does not strictly establish regulations for compliance when traveling on merchant ships in the future, it will not only endanger the shipping industry, but also greatly affect military discipline. Now, in order to prevent future troubles, we must take precautions. It is proposed that your ministry formulate detailed regulations in the regulations and circulate them to all military agencies for compliance in order to maintain the shipping industry and discipline the military administration. According to the report, a copy of the report is enclosed and sent to your ministry for investigation and implementation. It is hoped that you will reply. Two attached reports are attached. According to this, it is now approved that the Ministry has drafted the Regulations for the Transportation of Dangerous Goods by the Military on Ships and will be promulgated and implemented on May 1. In addition to presenting and notifying separately, a copy of the regulations is enclosed and sent to you for investigation and compliance. This order and other matters are attached with a copy of the Regulations for the Transportation of Dangerous Goods by the Military on Ships. According to this, the attached documents are recorded and printed, and a letter is sent to you for your information.</p>
<p>Regulations: Regulations for the Transportation of Dangerous Goods by the Military on Ships, Article 1: Accidents often occur due to improper handling of the transportation of dangerous goods by the military on ships. In order to prevent such incidents, these regulations are specifically formulated for compliance. Dangerous goods in these regulations refer to various gunpowder, bullets, artillery shells, bombs, toxic gases, and various incendiary devices. Article 2: Before transporting dangerous goods on board, the highest director of the transportation unit (agency) shall appoint a special escort commissioner to carry a military transportation passport or certificate, which shall be verified by the shipowner to designate a suitable cabin before loading. Article 3: No passengers are allowed to enter the cargo hold where dangerous goods are stored, except for crew members, to avoid accidents. Article 4: The cargo hold for loading dangerous goods shall not be close to the engine room and kitchen to avoid vibration and explosion. Article 5: Dangerous goods of different properties shall not be loaded in the same cabin, and all easily flammable or explosive items shall not be approached, and shall be isolated from ordinary commercial goods. Article 6: The loading and unloading of dangerous goods must be stable, safe, and completed quickly, and there shall be no throwing, rolling, or other such incidents. Article 7: The cabin door for storing dangerous goods shall be locked day and night, and the escort commissioner shall inspect the surrounding area outside the door from time to time, and soldiers shall be assigned to guard in shifts to prevent negligence. Article 8: Escort officers and soldiers are not allowed to smoke, drink, or cause trouble. The soldiers on guard are not allowed to sit or lie down at will or leave their posts without authorization. Article 9: The escort officers and soldiers shall be subject to the crew's dispatch for opening and stopping the ship, and shall not interfere arbitrarily, and shall not insult the crew. Article 10: If the escort officers and soldiers have any circumstances of contracting passengers and carrying goods in addition to the designated number of people and items, and violate the provisions of these regulations, the shipowner may report to the nearest highest military agency for disposal before reporting to the Ministry of Military Affairs for review. Article 11: If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, they may be submitted for revision. Article 12: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Location for the Collection of Business Tax on Egg Factories <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Request for Determination by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: Respected Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, on the 7th of this month, we received a letter from the Egg Factory Guild in this city, stating that our members are purely Chinese-funded and purchase fresh eggs in egg-producing areas in the interior, such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, and other provinces, and set up factories locally to produce dried and wet egg yolks, which are transported to Shanghai and sold by Shanghai branches to foreign firms for export. The so-called branches are the exclusive sales agencies set up by various factories in the interior, or one factory has one branch, or two or three factories jointly set up one branch. These egg yolks and egg whites are not sold domestically and rely entirely on European and American countries for the final outlet. Therefore, in terms of inland factories, they only buy but do not sell, and in terms of Shanghai branches, they only sell but do not buy. Only when the factory and the branch are combined can a business be formed. Now, in order to maintain the tax revenue after the abolition of the likin tax, the government will implement business taxes as compensation. Upon investigation, the business tax regulations of each province do not include the name of the egg yolk and egg white manufacturing industry. Although the draft business tax rate proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance lists the egg yolk and egg white industry in the manufacturing industry tax rate table, taxing it at 5/1000 of the capital amount, none of our members have set up factories for manufacturing within the Shanghai municipal area. The branches set up are only a few income-generating, and there is no capital to speak of. Then, in the future, where will the business tax of our members be collected, either at the factory or at the Shanghai branch? If it is collected at the factory, what will be the basis for the tax rate in each province? These two points are questionable. Furthermore, the business nature of our members is entirely foreign trade. Recently, it has been affected by the United States' high profile of increasing import taxes, and the future of the business is precarious. In order to encourage foreign trade, the government's original intention is to maintain the national industry. The business tax rate for the egg yolk and egg white industry should be particularly low to show consideration and encouragement. We dare to ask your association to telegraph the Ministry of Finance for a prompt and clear explanation of the above two points and to specify a unified business tax rate for the egg yolk and egg white industry in each province so that we can follow it. Upon investigation, the industry sets up factories in the interior, but the transaction takes place in the Shanghai market. It must cross two administrative regions to complete the buying and selling activities. It is different from the business operations of the head office and branch. Then, should this business tax be collected at the location where the factory is set up or at the location where the transaction takes place? If the Ministry does not determine the method, disputes will inevitably arise between government offices, causing merchants to bear the burden repeatedly. We should truthfully telegraph your Ministry for review and give a discretionary method so that there will be compliance. As for the proposal of the industry to unify the business tax rate for the egg yolk and egg white manufacturing industry in each province, according to the regulations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the tax rate for the manufacturing industry is stipulated to be from 2/1000 to 24/1000 of the capital amount. The general regulations in Anhui Province are within 20/1000. How will the egg yolk and egg white manufacturing industry be regulated in the future? It is still difficult to speculate. The industry's statement that the business is in danger due to the recent increase in import tariffs in the United States is a factual situation. All provinces should consult with the Ministry and the current draft proposal of the city to determine a moderate tax rate so that each province may not exceed it, which may be enough to save it slightly. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Continued Report on the Chaoyang Disaster in Rehe <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Report on the Proceeds of the Jisheng Association</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Association previously reported on the tragic disaster in Chaoyang County, Rehe. The association and General Zhu Ziqiao jointly organized emergency relief, each allocating 10,000 yuan for relief, which has been recorded in previous reports. Now, we have received a detailed report from Mr. Yu Guisheng, the director of relief in the Tianjin office of the association, which stated that according to a friend from Chaoyang, the entire territory of Chaoyang is mountainous and watery. Last year, in addition to the flood disaster, there were also drought, frost, and hail disasters. The autumn harvest was disappointing, and people's food was extremely difficult. No one was hired to work, and there were many unemployed in both the industrial and commercial sectors. When one person loses their job, their parents, wives, and children are all suffering from hunger and cold. If no other solution is found, they will all die. Therefore, the elderly and the young went to the Northeast provinces to seek a living. They continued to beg for food along the way. The entire area was a disaster area, and they could not get enough to eat all day long. From Chaoyang to Jinzhou, it takes more than 20 days, and some even commit suicide halfway. Some die of hunger, some sell their children, and some husbands see their wives commit suicide and die, and then kill the children they carry with them and die together. All kinds of tragic situations are hard to describe. At present, there are many bandits in Chaoyang, most of whom are forced by hunger and cold, gathering a large number of victims and forcibly feeding large households. It has also been seen repeatedly. Now there are more than 2,000 people gathered here, requesting to go east to escape the famine. They are in a very embarrassing situation and urgently need help.</p>

<p>Recent Report on the Proceeds of Relief in Jiangxi</p>
<p>The China Moral Society and the Jisheng Association jointly organized relief in Jiangxi, which has been recorded in the newspapers. Ten counties in Jizhou, Jiangxi Province, have been ravaged by bandits for several years. Wails of sorrow can be heard everywhere, and people are displaced. The disaster is extremely tragic and heartbreaking. In March, it was reported that 2,980 yuan and more than 700 sets of cotton clothing were distributed for emergency relief in the urban and rural areas of the county. As the banditry in the countryside has not been eliminated, it is not possible to go there for distribution. The county has a refugee shelter for ten counties. According to previous reports, it has sheltered more than 1,400 refugees. The Moral and Jisheng Associations had previously allocated 4,000 yuan to solve the urgent needs. Now, they have received an urgent letter from the shelter and yesterday, they remitted 4,000 yuan from the China Bank in Nanchang to Mr. Gu Yabin, a relief worker in Nanchang, for transfer and use. At this time of year when crops are not yet ready, the refugees can maintain their lives temporarily. As for the relief work in Nanchang, the two associations allocated 3,000 yuan in March and another 5,000 yuan for relief in Guangchang in April, along with the funds and relief clothing brought by Director Zhang Xianqing to Nanchang, which is a considerable amount. Recently, the Gan River has flooded again, and the situation is miserable. Efforts are still being made to raise funds, but it is felt that it will be difficult to continue.</p>
<h3 id="e108">An Incident Regarding the Incense Pilgrimage at Jing'an Temple <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>A Petition and Appeal from Stallholders</p>
<p>Regarding the Bureau of Public Works' announcement restricting the setting up of stalls for this year's Buddha's Birthday at the Jing'an Temple in West Shanghai, stallholders have initiated a temporary Stallholders' Union. They have publicly elected more than ten people, including Xi Yongxin, Li Zhaolian, and Jiang Peiyun, as committee members and hired lawyer Chen Ruilin as an advisor. They have jointly petitioned the Bureau of Public Works, urging them to retract their decision, and have appealed to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and others. The text of their petition is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To the Bureau of Public Works: A petition to earnestly request the retraction of the restrictive order on setting up stalls for Buddha's Birthday at Jing'an Temple in order to maintain the livelihood of ordinary people. We, the small merchants, read in the Shenbao newspaper on April 26th that Your Bureau has decided to restrict stall locations for this year's Buddha's Birthday festival at Jing'an Temple in Shanghai. Upon hearing this, we were shocked and terrified. The practice of setting up stalls for Buddha's Birthday at Jing'an Temple has a long history of over a thousand years. Every year, the small merchants set up stalls for about ten days during Buddha's Birthday to sell local products and miscellaneous goods manufactured throughout the year in the city, earning meager profits to sustain their livelihoods for the year. In recent years, the population of the concessions has increased, and the area for stalls should have been expanded. However, Your Bureau, citing traffic concerns, has instead proposed restrictions, prohibiting stalls around Jing'an Temple and in front of shops. Only scattered, isolated sections are designated, separated on all sides and unable to connect. Business is bound to plummet. We believe that this restriction is tantamount to strict prohibition, eliminating a long-standing custom. The small merchants have already been guarding their stall locations for over a month and are now affected by this, unable to set up stalls, thus cutting off the livelihood of the poor. Furthermore, Jing'an Temple had a land lease contract with Your Bureau in 1899, which stipulated that stalls were permitted to be set up freely during Buddha's Birthday. The roads have been widened in recent years, and stalls used to be set up in the middle of the roads, but in recent years, they have been set up on the small roads on both sides, so they do not obstruct traffic. It is only that there are many pilgrims and tourists, and vehicles cannot travel at high speed. As for setting up stalls in front of shops, businesses have actually increased as a result, so shopkeepers have never opposed it. This stall setup is beneficial to society, the people's livelihood, and local commerce. Considering that Your Bureau has always been dedicated to helping ordinary people and benefiting society, we jointly and earnestly request Your Bureau to retract the restrictive order on setting up stalls, preserve the custom of previous years, and maintain the livelihood of over a thousand stallholders. This would be a great act of benevolence. Respectfully submitted to the Director-General of the Board of Directors of the Bureau of Public Works.</p>
<p>To the Bureau of Social Affairs: A petition to appeal for efforts to persuade the Bureau of Public Works to retract the restriction on setting up stalls for Buddha's Birthday at Jing'an Temple in order to maintain the livelihood of ordinary people. We, the small merchants, read in the newspaper that the Bureau of Public Works is restricting the setting up of stalls and the sale of domestic goods at this year's Buddha's Birthday festival at Jing'an Temple in West Shanghai. Upon hearing this, we were deeply shocked. The setting up of stalls has been a custom for thousands of years, exclusively selling domestic goods and local products. Every year, the small merchants take advantage of this Buddha's Birthday opportunity to set up stalls for about ten days to sell off all the goods they have made throughout the year to sustain their livelihoods for the year. Now, the Bureau of Public Works, citing traffic obstruction as a pretext, has initiated a strict restriction, prohibiting stalls on the roads near Jing'an Temple and in front of shops. Only a small number of isolated sections in remote areas are permitted, separated on all sides and unable to connect. Business is hopeless. Moreover, the stallholders have been braving the elements and guarding their old stall locations for over a month, and now they are affected by this, unable to set up stalls, thus cutting off the livelihood of us ordinary people. Furthermore, Jing'an Temple had a land lease contract with the Bureau of Public Works in 1899, which stipulated that stalls were permitted to be set up freely during Buddha's Birthday. The roads around Jing'an Temple have all been widened, and stalls that used to be set up in the middle of the roads have recently been moved to the small roads on both sides, so there is absolutely no reason to obstruct traffic. It is only that there are many pilgrims and tourists, and many vehicles, so only cars cannot travel at high speed. All the shops have increased their business because of the stalls over the years, and we have never heard of any opposition to the stalls. This stall setup is truly a commercial arena for promoting domestic goods, beneficial to society and the people's livelihood, and not insignificant. Therefore, we appeal to Your Bureau to uphold justice, grant relief, and assist in efforts to persuade in order to promote domestic goods and maintain the livelihoods of thousands of ordinary people. We would be deeply grateful. (The petitions to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association are the same and are omitted.)</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Case of the American Soldier Shooting Gu Jingen to Death <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Deceased's Younger Brother, Gu Awu, Appeals to All Parties for Assistance</p>
<p>Gu Jingen, who worked at the Taichang Construction Company on Guizhou Road in South Jiulu, was shot to death on the 23rd of last month by an American sailor and a bus driver residing at No. 15 Broadway Road, Gongping Road. The Shenbao newspaper reported this on the 24th of last month. Now, we learn that the deceased's younger brother, Gu Awu, firmly intends to seek justice for his brother and is unwilling to easily accept compensation after the autopsy. He was assisted by Mr. Zhang, the manager of Taichang Company, to entrust a complaint to the American Consulate through Mr. K. Meng of the Union Settlement, demanding punishment of the perpetrator, an apology, and compensation. Half a month has passed without any results. The perpetrator and the bus driver are still at large, residing in their original place. The deceased's younger brother, Gu Awu, believing that his brother's injustice has not been redressed, has been appealing to various organizations and groups in recent days for assistance, hoping to seek justice for the deceased.</p>

<p>Sea Bandits Rob Fishing Boats</p>
<p>Five Patrol Boats Go to Suppress</p>
<p>Li, the team leader of the First Brigade of the Wusong-Suzhou Five Prefecture Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Team, received successive reports in recent days from imported yellow croaker boats and first haul pomfret boats, stating that large numbers of sea bandits were robbing fishing boats in various ports offshore. After receiving the reports, Team Leader Li believed that the robbery of fishing boats by sea bandits not only harmed fishermen and merchants but also had a significant impact on national tax revenue. Therefore, at about 1 p.m. yesterday afternoon, he supervised armed team members and boarded five patrol boats to set sail, departing for Liuhai, Hupu, Fushan, Baimao, Xiyang, Luyuan, and other ports to patrol and suppress sea bandits, protecting fishermen and merchants and strengthening coastal defense.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Opening of the Yangxing-Liuhang Section of Baoshan County Road <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The bridges, culverts, road surface, etc., of the Yangxing-Liuhang section of the east-west Baoshan County Road were completed last year. However, due to the construction of a radio station near the middle section of the road, heavy materials were transported by trucks, and during the plum rain season, continuous rain caused significant damage to the roadbed. Negotiations were conducted repeatedly, but no repairs were made. Therefore, the Construction Bureau submitted a request to the Construction Department to supervise the Traffic Affairs Office to carry out repairs themselves. The repairs have now been completed, and there is a great need for transportation on the Yangxing-Liuhang section. Therefore, Director Wu repeatedly urged the Chengsong-Yang Long-Distance Bus Company, which has now scheduled to begin operations today to facilitate transportation. It is reported that there will be a total of six round trips between Yangxing and Liuhang each day. The fare schedule is listed below:</p>
<p>Baoshan</p>
<p>Wusong 18 cents</p>
<p>Sanguantang 11 cents 11 cents Yangxing 16 cents 22 cents 22 cents Donglu 12 cents 30 cents 30 cents Liuhang 12 cents 22 cents 35 cents 88 cents 38 cents</p>
<h3 id="e112">Postponement of Direct Collection of Slaughter Tax <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The slaughter tax on fresh pork in this city has been contracted to meat merchants, who then collect it from various shops. The collection method does not follow the regulations of paying 39 cents per pig. Instead, it is collected according to the size of each meat merchant's business, ranging from four or five yuan per shop per month to seven or eight yuan, ten or more yuan, or twenty or more yuan. Currently, the Finance Bureau, in order to reorganize taxes and duties, and because the contract period for the contractors has expired, has decided to directly collect from each shop starting on May 1st. Regardless of the number of pigs slaughtered, tax tickets must be purchased according to the regulations. However, the meat merchants believe that this method is not only troublesome procedurally but also requires more taxes to be paid. For example, if a shop usually slaughters one pig per day, totaling thirty pigs per month, paying 39 cents per pig according to the regulations would require paying 11 yuan and 70 cents. However, under the contractor system, paying five or six yuan was sufficient. Larger shops slaughter three or four pigs or five or six pigs per day, and the tax they pay is only ten or more yuan or twenty or more yuan. Therefore, the shops are observing and unwilling to purchase tax tickets for the direct collection of taxes by the Finance Bureau. The Finance Bureau's implementation of the collection yesterday resulted in slaughtered white pigs from various workshops not being allowed to be sent out without tax tickets. On the same day, representatives of the industry, Rong Qianchu, Shen Xie, Ye Xiangxian, and Huang Yexin, went to the Municipal Government to request a postponement of the direct collection. The Municipal Government agreed to postpone it for one week, to be implemented on the 15th, and instructed the representatives to persuade their colleagues. It is also heard that the meat merchants have now sent representatives to the capital to petition and have scheduled a meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 14th to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Rice Merchants Attempt to Manipulate Rice Prices Again <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately, the Authorities Stopped it in Time</p>
<p>Since the spring of this year, rice prices in Shanghai have been stable, with no significant fluctuations. Recently, there were rumors that Northern gangs were shipping rice, and manipulators, hearing this, scrambled to hoard rice, believing that prices would inevitably rise after the Northern gangs shipped rice, and they could make huge profits by selling it. Therefore, prices have been rising daily in recent weeks. Northern Dingbai rice has now risen to 13 yuan and 45 cents, while Southern Sutong white rice initially opened at 10 yuan, 34 cents, but rose to 11 yuan and 70 cents yesterday. This was discovered by the authorities, who, believing that the rice price increase was related to the people's livelihood at a time when the new crop was not yet available, ordered the rice industry not to raise prices and investigated whether there were any export activities. The market has gradually stabilized in the past two days.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Kidnappers Was Arrested in Beiping</p>
<p>A Beiping dispatch from the previous day carried a news item about the arrest of the ringleader of a Tianjin kidnapping gang in Beiping and his escort to Tianjin. The content stated that two notorious bandits, Shuai Zhongping and Wu Ruichen, were recently arrested in Beiping by the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, followed by the arrest of accomplices Yang Yuting and Gao Shiqing. On the afternoon of the 6th, ten specially armed police officers escorted them to Tianjin for interrogation. It is now learned that the bandit leader Shuai Zhongping, originally named Songting, styled Yinsan, is said to be the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Lu Shaotang, a prominent real estate merchant in this city. It is recalled that among the bandits arrested in the Lu case, there was one named Shuai Lei, who was Shuai's adopted son, and the two bandit dens on Lafayette Road and Hart Road were also Shuai's residences. After the Lu case was cracked, Shuai immediately fled. At the time, it was generally speculated that he must have fled to Dalian or the Liaoshen area, as Beiping and Tianjin were places he often visited. It was not expected that he would be so bold. Initially, it was not expected that the bandit would make good use of people's psychology and hide in Beiping under the alias Cai Ming, hoping to evade the law. Unexpectedly, the net of heaven is vast, and he was eventually arrested, proving that the principles of heaven are infallible.</p>

<p>The Stealing Chicken Bridge Car Stopped for Twenty Minutes</p>
<p>The French-operated Route 5 tram, which runs between the West Gate and the North Station, stopped at Stealing Chicken Bridge on Zhejiang Road at about 9 p.m. last night. Three passengers wanted to board the tram to go north. The driver refused to open the door, saying that there were too many passengers on the tram. The passengers insisted on boarding, leading to arguments. The two sides almost came to blows. A crowd gathered to watch, and the driver stopped moving forward. The stalemate lasted for twenty minutes. The police on duty brought both parties to the police station to resolve the matter. Several passengers on the tram, willing to testify, also went along. However, when Route 5 stopped, other trams, such as Route 7, Route 6, and Route 3, were unable to proceed, blocking the road and disrupting traffic. It is said that the three passengers who wanted to board Route 5 were special police officers from the police station.</p>

<p>Implicated by the Name "Little Leper Head"</p>
<p>The Main Culprit in a Murder Case Also Has This Name</p>
<p>He Was Released After a Witness Testified</p>
<p>Wang A'da, a native of Ningbo, was shot and injured on February 19th of last year near the Deyilou Tea House on Seward Road. Wang Wanfu, Tang Xingfa, Tong Xingsheng, and others were arrested at the time and sentenced by the court to imprisonment. However, the main culprit, "Little Leper Head," escaped. Now, according to the Hongkou Police Station, Liu Ziming, a native of Ningbo residing at No. 2332 Zhaofeng Road, nicknamed "Little Leper Head," may be the main culprit in the case. He was arrested and sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. The magistrate Xiao brought him in for interrogation the other day. The police also brought in Wang Wanfu and others, who were imprisoned in the West Prison, for questioning. The victim, Wang A'da, also appeared in court and described the circumstances of the assassination. After carefully identifying Liu Ziming, he solemnly stated that the "Little Leper Head" who committed the crime was short and not as burly as the defendant, and there must be another person. He said that he could still identify the "Little Leper Head" if he was arrested. Wang Wanfu and others also testified that the defendant was not present. The defendant hired a lawyer to clarify that he had been wrongly arrested and requested his release. Magistrate Xiao ruled that according to the testimony of all parties, the defendant was indeed not related to the case and immediately ordered his acquittal. The police lawyer also stated that he had no objection to the verdict. The magistrate then ordered his immediate release.</p>

<p>Xu Xinzhang, a butcher from Ningbo residing at No. 300 Benzai Lane, Yuezhou Road, is already over forty years old, while his wife, Jin, is only nineteen years old. The mismatch in their ages made her susceptible to love affairs, so she had an affair with a young man named Fan Fuxue. This was discovered in April of this year. However, Xu loved his wife deeply and did not want her to suffer, so he ordered Fan to write a confession, stipulating three rules that he should not have similar actions in the future, thinking that he had taken extreme precautions and there would be no further problems. However, the connection was not severed, and they continued as before, only more discreetly. Therefore, she felt constrained. The other day, Fan took advantage of Xu's absence to entice her to elope. They were about to disappear, but Xu's brother saw them and arrested them on behalf of his brother and called the police. They were detained in the Third Precinct, Fifth Sub-station. Xu returned home and learned of the situation, becoming very angry and demanding an investigation at the police station. Yesterday, the case was transferred to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>A Martial Arts Play at the Yangjiadu Dongxing Theater</p>
<p>The Yangjiadu Main Street in Pudong is densely populated with migrant residents. Previously, Chen Guoliang and others from Jiangbei opened a theater called the Dongxing Theater, hiring Huaiyang actors to perform Yangzhou opera, opening day and night, and doing good business. However, conflicts occasionally arose between the audience and the theater due to minor issues. Last year, the local police station ordered them to stop performing for several months due to an accident. Later, they were allowed to continue performing, but disputes still occurred from time to time. Unexpectedly, a major conflict broke out between the audience and the ticket seller at about 8 p.m. the other night. A few men had come to the theater pretending to be looking for someone, intending to watch the show for free. The ticket seller refused and spoke harshly to them. Suddenly, more than ten people rushed in from outside and fought with the ticket sellers. Teapots and teacups were smashed, and the theater was in chaos. The audience dispersed. Two ticket sellers, Yu Zaihou and Shi Xianzhu, were seriously injured and sent to a hospital in Puxi for treatment. When the conflict first broke out, the theater owner, Chen Guoliang, immediately reported it to the Third Precinct, First Sub-station, and the police officer on duty led a large group of police officers to the scene. The perpetrators Huang Xiaoerzi, Cao Xiaoyu, Huang Ruxiang, Wu Xiaobao, Wu Er, Zhang Youcai, Qin Daguozi, Ji Xiaoxizi, Chen Xiaowuzi, Li Alin, Zhang Xiaowuzi, and eleven others were arrested and taken to the police station. Later, another person shouted to those arrested in front of the police station, telling them not to confess to the assault. He was also arrested by the guards on duty. Under interrogation, he said his name was Yang (nicknamed Jiangbei Boss) and admitted to being the leader of the gang. After investigating the matter, the police chief Yang determined that the case was related to disturbing public order and ordered that they be sent to the Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>

Her husband thought it was a good idea and sent her off at the riverbank, telling her to send news home often to ease his worries. Unexpectedly, more than a year passed without any news. He came to Shanghai to look for her a few days ago, staying at No. 2, Xinshali, Xixie Bridge in West Shanghai. He searched everywhere but could not find her. He had not seen her stay with any family among his fellow villagers. Unexpectedly, Zhao Zhu passed by the alley yesterday, and Zhao saw that she resembled his wife, so he followed her.

<p>Telegraph Request to Exempt Business Tax from Zhuang Customers</p>
<p>And Should Levy Tax on Industries</p>
<p>The Tax Rules Research Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Trade Associations, regarding the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance's levy of business tax on timber Zhuang customers, specially telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to stop it. The text reads: "Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance of the Nanjing National Government, after investigation, Zhuang customers who only buy and do not sell, and who have no business income, should be exempt from business tax. This was approved by the Ministry's Order No. 5754 and distributed to the Finance Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to comply with. Recently, we received a letter from the Shanghai Timber Trade Association stating that our members send people to Fujian to set up Zhuang in Zhongzhou to purchase timber, which is entirely buying and not selling, and there is no business income, so there is no need to pay business tax in that province. However, we recently received letters and telegrams from Zhuang customers stationed in Fujian, all stating that the Provincial Department of Finance has now changed the abolished consumption tax on bamboo and wood to a business tax on bamboo and wood, and on May 1st, it set up a bureau and sent personnel along the Zhongzhou River to collect taxes by force. After recording and reporting to the Ministry and requesting exemption, the Ministry claimed that they had not seen any explicit documents and could not verify it. The provincial business tax in Fujian, which levies taxes on goods, is inconsistent with the revised Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial business tax regulations of the Ministry, which stipulate that taxes should be levied on industries. It is even more against the Ministry's orders to force Zhuang customers who only buy and do not sell to pay business tax. We hereby report the situation and request that you review and instruct them to correct it to comply with the law and be convenient for the public. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal Trade Associations Tax Rules Research Committee."</p>

<p>Cheng Genbao, a 16-year-old girl from Wuxi, is currently working in a sock factory near the Shanghai Army Camp in the Nanshi area. She lives at No. 335 Dongjiadu Street. Yesterday morning around 7 o'clock, Genbao went to the factory to work as usual. Unexpectedly, when she was passing through the Lujiabang area, three men suddenly came up, seeing that Genbao was alone and could be bullied, and followed her. At that time, it happened to be raining, and they did not have umbrellas, so they saw Genbao holding a parasol. They rushed up in a crowd and said, "Sister, where are you going? It's raining heavily, and our clothes are all wet. Thank you, can we share your umbrella to avoid the rain?" Genbao did not say a word. They took the opportunity to tease her. Genbao was extremely angry and rebuked them. The three men became angry out of shame and started cursing each other. Then they beat Genbao. The girl was weak and dared not resist. Fortunately, she grabbed one of the three men on the spot and shouted for the guard police at the 22nd post of the area, who took him to the First Section of the First District. The other two had already escaped. When the director of the station interrogated him, the man confessed his name was Zhang Xinghua, 19 years old, a local, and currently an apprentice at the Daxing Machine Factory on Zhonghua Road. His other words were vague and he was ordered to be detained for verification.</p>

<p>Principal Offender and Related Persons Detained</p>
<p>Recently, Lu Ada from Pudong has been specializing in selling counterfeit money in the city, selling it for 30 yuan per hundred yuan. Most of those who are unafraid of the law and only seek profit buy it and use it to deceive others, disrupting the financial system, which is truly hateful. The police station has repeatedly received reports, but because the transaction location is extremely secret, investigation is not easy, and it is difficult to solve the case. The other day, detective Feng Zhiming finally learned that they were buying and selling at the Lao Xinfang Hotel at No. 36 Jingyuan Street, so he sent his assistant Zhu Shengquan to pretend to be a buyer and visited Lu in room 11. After agreeing on the amount and value of the purchase, they agreed on a time for delivery. Zhu then reported back to detective Feng and led detectives to surround and arrest them. Besides Lu Ada, Jin Yuxiang, Ma Yongrui (aka Ma Arong), Zhang Xigen, and others from his hometown were also in the room and were arrested. Lu was found to have ten ten-yuan counterfeit bills and fifty five-yuan counterfeit bills in his possession, all of which were searched out. They were then sent to the Special District Local Court for investigation. Lu, Jin, and Ma confessed to colluding to sell counterfeit money. However, Zhang Xigen confessed that Jin was his brother-in-law and that he went to the hotel to ask Jin for a loan of 40 yuan and was arrested along with him. Judge Xu instructed all the defendants to be detained for another hearing. Zhang Xigen was allowed to be released on bail if he could provide a security deposit of 1,000 yuan or a substantial store. The location of the counterfeiting machine is still under investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Cai Zhengya's Speech on Recent Labor Issues in Shanghai <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association previously held a meeting at the Lianhua General Association, inviting statistics expert Cai Zhengya to give a speech entitled "Recent Labor Issues in Shanghai." We have obtained the original manuscript and are publishing it below:</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Management Association is a group dedicated to studying issues related to industrial and commercial management. But how should we approach the study of these issues? First, we need to briefly discuss the attitude we should adopt. When approaching a problem to be studied, we should first adopt an objective, impartial, and unbiased attitude to collect materials. The goal is to understand the actual content of the issue, not to predict what it should be. Only with facts can we have a basis for research and seek methods for improvement. Therefore, I hope to briefly discuss the recent labor situation in Shanghai today. Everyone here is a prominent figure in the business world, and time is precious. If I can provide you with some important information regarding labor issues as a basis for discussion, then I won't have wasted your valuable time. However, to make a concise observation of the extremely complex labor issues in Shanghai in a very short period of time will inevitably lead to omissions. Now, I will select a few important matters to discuss.</p>
<p>(1) Labor-Capital Disputes: Labor-capital disputes are a very important issue between labor and capital recently. Strikes are the method used by labor to deal with capital, temporarily ceasing work to achieve their demands. Lockouts are the method used by capital to deal with labor, temporarily suspending work to achieve the demands of capital. Now, let's put aside cases of labor-capital disputes that did not lead to strikes or lockouts. Let's first look at the figures for strikes and lockouts in the entire city in the last three years, 1928, 1929, and 1930, to observe the situation. In 1928, there were 120 strike cases, involving 5,438 factories, 213,966 workers, 3,010,926 lost workdays, and a loss of $1,592,593 in wages. In 1929, there were 111 strike and lockout cases, involving 1,512 factories, 68,867 workers, 751,146 lost workdays, and a loss of $488,695 in wages. In 1930, there were 87 strike and lockout cases, involving 672 factories, 63,802 workers, 810,102 lost workdays, and a loss of $469,477 in wages. Lockout cases were very few, only a few each year. Observing the figures for the past three years, it can be seen that the labor unrest in 1928 was very serious. Afterwards, the situation eased and gradually trended downwards. Now, let's talk about the main causes of disputes. Over the years, there have been many reasons for labor-capital disputes, but they are always concentrated on four aspects: wages, hiring and firing, collective agreements, and treatment. In 1928, cases arising from wage issues accounted for 22.5% of the total cases for the year, those arising from hiring or firing accounted for 20.0%, those arising from collective agreements accounted for 14.1%, and those arising from treatment issues accounted for 67.5%. In 1929, cases arising from wage issues accounted for 23.4% of the total cases for the year, those arising from hiring or firing accounted for 32.4%, those arising from collective agreements accounted for 14.4%, and those arising from treatment issues accounted for 9.9%. In 1930, cases arising from wage issues accounted for 41.4% of the total cases for the year, those arising from hiring or firing accounted for 14.9%, those arising from collective agreements accounted for 13.8%, and those arising from treatment issues accounted for 10.3%. The above figures tell us that in 1928, cases arising from the four items of wages, hiring or firing, collective agreements, and treatment accounted for 67.5% of the total cases for the year, 80.2% in 1929, and 80.5% in 1930. Among these four items, wages are the most important, followed by hiring or firing. If we want to promote labor-capital cooperation, we should first study these four fundamental issues. Now, let's look at the figures for the results of disputes, which can represent the attitudes of both labor and capital and the trends in their negotiating power. In 1928, cases where the labor side's demands were fully accepted by the capital side accounted for 38.5% of the total cases for the year, those where the capital side partially accepted accounted for 33.3%, and those where the capital side did not accept accounted for 10.5%. There were no cases where the capital side made demands. In 1929, cases where the labor side's demands were fully accepted by the capital side accounted for 28.8% of the total cases for the year, those where the capital side partially accepted accounted for 36.9%, and those where the capital side did not accept accounted for 28.8%. There were no cases where the capital side demanded full acceptance by the labor side, those where the labor side partially accepted accounted for 0.9%, and those where the labor side did not accept accounted for 1.8%. In 1930, cases where the labor side's demands were fully accepted by the capital side accounted for 24.1%, those where the capital side partially accepted accounted for 43.7%, and those where the capital side did not accept accounted for 25.3%. There were no cases where the capital side demanded full acceptance by the labor side, those where the labor side partially accepted accounted for 4.6%, and those where the labor side did not accept accounted for 1.3%. The above figures tell us that the cases where the labor side's demands were fully accepted have significantly decreased, and the cases where the labor side's demands were not accepted have increased. Although the cases where the labor side's demands were partially accepted have also increased, in 1929 and 1930, the capital side even began to make demands for the labor side to accept, which was unprecedented. From this, it can be seen that the labor side can no longer demand anything from the capital side as it did in the past. In other words, the capital side is gradually able to defend against the attacks of the labor side and has begun to attack the labor side.</p>
<p>(2) Wages and Working Hours: When it comes to the wages and working hours of Shanghai workers, our materials are limited to factory workers, not including handicraft workers. There are a total of 21 important industries in this city. These 21 industries have a total of 2,326 factories. If we follow the regulations of the Factory Law, which stipulates that only those with 30 or more employees can be called factories, then there are only 697 factories. Regardless of this regulation, these 21 industries have a total of 285,700 workers. Regarding wages and working hours, workers' income can be divided into two types: one is the fixed wage rate, paid by the hour or by the piece, and issued periodically; the other is the actual income, which is the fixed wage plus bonuses, dividends, or rice subsidies, etc., minus the deductions. According to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's report on wages and working hours for 1929, I have calculated the figures for male, female, and child labor separately, based on the number of people in each industry, as follows: the average daily wage rate for male workers is $0.75, the average monthly actual income is $24.43, and the average daily working hours are 10.5 hours; the average daily wage rate for female workers is $0.50, the average monthly actual income is $12.73, and the average daily working hours are 11.5 hours; the average daily wage rate for child workers is $0.36, the average monthly actual income is $8.70, and the average daily working hours are 10.7 hours. The overall average for male, female, and child labor is a daily wage rate of $0.57, a monthly actual income of $15.95, and daily working hours of 10.8 hours. The above figures are for workers with varying wages in all 21 industries. Among these 21 industries, if we determine the importance of an industry based on the number of people it employs, then cotton spinning and silk reeling are the most important. These two industries account for 41% of the total number of people employed in the 21 industries. The wages of workers in these two industries are relatively low, and the working hours are also relatively long. This is because workers in these two industries do not necessarily need to undergo a long period of training to be competent. Therefore, their skills cannot be said to be very strong or important, so their wages are also relatively low. The average daily wage rate for female workers in the cotton spinning industry is only $0.452, the average monthly actual income is only $12.50, and the working hours are nearly 12 hours. The average daily wage rate for female workers in the silk reeling industry is $0.539, the average monthly actual income is $13.22, and the working hours are nearly 11 hours. These two industries rely heavily on female labor, so I am only discussing the wages of female workers. This can also be said to be a model figure for Shanghai factory workers.</p>
<p>(3) Cost of Living: To study labor issues, we must not only ask about the income of workers, but we must also ask about their expenses. What is the average annual cost of living for a worker's family? What percentage of the total cost of living is accounted for by the five categories of clothing, food, housing, fuel, and miscellaneous items? Is the trend of living expenses for Shanghai workers upward or downward? Although the cost of living index compiled by the Tariff Commission of the Ministry of Finance is limited to yarn factory workers in this city, it is sufficient to represent a glimpse of the living conditions of ordinary workers. The percentages of these five types of expenses are distributed as follows: food accounts for 56.0%, clothing accounts for 9.4%, rent accounts for 6.4%, fuel accounts for 7.5%, and miscellaneous items account for 20.6%. The above figures tell us that the largest expense for workers is food, followed by miscellaneous items. Miscellaneous items include all other expenses, such as hygiene, education, entertainment, etc., which are of course included. If we analyze it carefully, we will know that the expenses for hygiene, entertainment, and education are indeed pitifully small. The average annual expense for entertainment for a family is only $1.07, and education is $0.77. The monotonous life of workers, the inability to improve the level of workers' education, and the inability to develop advanced skills are natural consequences. The changes and trends in the cost of living for workers in this city can be seen in the cost of living index. This index uses 1926 as the standard for comparison. The expenses in this year are equal to 100, the index for 1928 is 102.5, for 1929 it is 107.9, and for 1930 it is 121.4. These figures indicate that the cost of living has increased significantly in recent years. In 1930, there was a very significant increase. One important reason is the impact of the high price of gold and the low price of silver, which led to rising prices. When prices rise, the purchasing power of money shrinks. This sudden increase in the cost of living is by no means matched by the rate of increase in wages, which makes the lives of workers even more miserable. In addition, there are many important issues such as unemployment, labor agreements, labor laws, labor organizations, and labor movements, which I will not discuss today due to time constraints. Now, let me summarize what I have said above. Since the National Revolutionary Army occupied Shanghai in 1927, until the first half of 1928, due to political changes and the instigation of the Communist Party, the labor community in Shanghai can be said to have been in a state of extreme excitement. Strikes occurred everywhere. Under this force, employers had no choice but to endure. This period can be said to be a period when the labor community rose and employers succumbed. From the second half of 1928, peace and order gradually returned, and labor laws were gradually created. The period of storms and waves in the past slowly passed. By 1929, labor administration had gradually become regulated. Labor-capital disputes gradually decreased. This period can be said to be a period when the labor movement was managed and supervised by the government. In 1930, employers were oppressed by the high price of gold and the low price of silver and the sluggishness of the industry, and they had to strive for survival. Although labor victories in labor-capital disputes still accounted for the majority, the attitude of employers hardened, and they did not easily give in. Sometimes, they even took an aggressive stance towards labor. This is a period of self-awareness and self-determination for employers. These three periods are very obvious. After several years of turmoil and disputes, it is now gradually getting on the right track. We very much hope to reach the fourth period, which is the period of labor-capital cooperation. Workers' wages, working hours, and cost of living are issues that are closely related to the labor side and should be resolved based on facts. The production of high-quality products and the increase in production are the keys to the development of industry and commerce. The more effort the Chinese people put in, the more the total amount of the national economy will increase. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the interests of both labor and capital are complementary, and the evolution of society depends entirely on the cooperation of the people. It can be seen that Dr. Sun Yat-sen paid close attention to labor-capital cooperation.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>According to experiments conducted by a large factory in northern England, flies will fly away when they see a house with yellow glass windows, and they dare not approach it. They also do not like rooms with blue painted walls. Therefore, if you want to avoid fly infestations in the summer, you may want to use yellow glass windows and blue painted walls.</p>
<p>The consumption of coffee by Americans averages 13 pounds per person per year. In the United Kingdom, proportionally, the average is only about half a pound per person per year.</p>
<p>Due to the large population and busy streets in London, traffic accidents are common. According to statistics from 1927, there were as many as 850 incidents. A large store lost 41,135 hours of office time due to this.</p>
<p>The Bay of Biscay, located north of France and Spain, has extremely clear water. The water used to raise aquatic animals in the London Zoo Aquarium is taken from here.</p>
<p>Among infectious diseases, there is a disease called foot-and-mouth disease, which is transmitted from animals. Between 1928 and 1929, the United Kingdom slaughtered 14,000 animals due to the spread of this disease.</p>
<h3 id="e141">United Celebration of All Circles in the Capital Amidst the Sound of the National Assembly <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>Motorcade Parade in the Joyful Rain on May 4th. A sweet rain fell. Although I did not go out, I was informed by a friend in a letter that at 1:30 pm that afternoon, more than 30 cars from various agencies gathered at the Public Sports Field on Park Road. At 2:00 pm, they set off in the rain. The military band led the way, with the command headquarters on both sides, issuing orders. There was a discipline department maintaining order. The procession passed through Huapailou, Zhongshan Road, Taiping Bridge, Yijiangmen, Drum Tower, Shiqiao Street, Shuiximen Street, Ziwu Road, Nanmen Street, Confucius Temple, Qiwang Street, Zhongzheng Street, and other places, distributing leaflets along the way. The spectators were like walls. The procession returned to the starting point and disbanded.</p>
<p>Lantern Parade Wrapped in Gentle Breeze after Dinner. I heard the sound of a flute, clear, melodious and pleasant. I rushed to see it, and saw everyone holding a paper red lantern, with the seven characters "Celebrating the National Assembly" pasted on the lantern. They walked in single file, one after another, on the muddy road. I heard that the forward was the Boy Scouts and male school students from all walks of life, who had already passed. Female school students followed behind, and the army brought up the rear. That evening, the rain stopped and the gentle breeze brushed, as if the heavens were helping their pleasure. It seemed to symbolize the light of our nation.</p>
<p>Celebration Rally Everyone Was Excited At 2:00 pm on the afternoon of May 5th, a rally to celebrate the National Assembly was held at the Public Sports Field. I did not go either. I heard that after the meeting opened as scheduled, representatives from the National Assembly, the Central Party Headquarters, the National and Municipal Governments, and various sectors gave speeches one after another. At the end, they shouted slogans and played music to end the meeting. Party and state dignitaries and the masses were all very excited.</p>
<p>Everyone Welcomed in Front of the Entertainment Stage After 8:00 pm, I sat in a rickshaw, bumping through the streets paved with rough stones. All along the way, there were teams of soldiers, some on horseback and some on foot. The sounds of rickshaws and cars advancing and retreating, and the stingy old man hobbling and slipping, were all interesting sights. Passing over Fucheng Bridge, the Qinhuai River runs horizontally north and south like a wriggling cyan dragon. The surrounding night was hazy, decorated with only a few electric torches. Turning south and passing through the First Park to Park Road, the three characters "Supervisory Yuan" formed by countless electric light bulbs were prominently displayed in the center of the archway standing tall in the blue sky. After another few steps, I entered the south gate of the venue. Looking around, there were mountains and seas of people. The entertainment stage was divided into three venues. I first went to the new drama performance area in the southwest corner. There, eight people, including martyrs, women, young men, and blind people, stood on either side, singing pure songs together. Due to the extreme crowding, I was unable to move forward and listen carefully, so I couldn't tell what song it was. However, there were three blind women wearing sunglasses, raising their heads and chests, and frequently moving their heads left and right. If it weren't for one blind woman and four blind men without glasses truthfully revealing their identities on their left, people would have thought they were sighted. I then went to the southeast, where a movie was being shown, "The Family of New People." I returned to the northwest to watch Peking Opera, where three scenes of "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao" were being performed simultaneously. It was overwhelming, so some people stood in one corner, staring intently without moving, while others moved around, sometimes southeast, sometimes northwest, and sometimes southeast again, unable to decide where to go. I walked around the venue once and estimated that I saw no fewer than ten thousand people. I returned and analyzed it carefully, and found that there were the most people watching Peking Opera, as they were mostly the uneducated masses. Those watching the new drama were the next most numerous, and they were mostly people from the lower and middle classes of society. Those watching the movie were the least numerous, and they were mostly people from the upper and middle classes. This certainly varies according to each individual's preferences, but it is also sufficient to show a glimpse of the psychology of the masses and the level of the nation. As for gender, men accounted for almost the entire number, while women were as rare as morning stars. However, whether they were fathers and sons, brothers, husbands and wives, or friends, they were all in pairs, rejoicing and cheering. Only I was a solitary person, coming and going alone, and I couldn't help but feel sad and returned home despondently.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Madam Zhong's Birthday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>On the 30th of last month, Mr. Zhong Weicheng, Dean of the School of Management at Jiaotong University, celebrated his mother's sixtieth birthday at the Dongfang Hotel. For a time, the leaders and scholars of Shanghai gathered together, bustling about, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. Mr. Zhong is a well-known figure in the transportation industry, so the birthday banners and couplets hanging on the four walls were mostly from the transportation industry. Sun Zhesheng, Wang Boqun, Ye Yuhu, Li Zhaohuan, Huang Hanliang, Gao Jiyi, and other gentlemen all personally wrote birthday couplets to offer their congratulations. Among them, the couplet by Mr. Huang Hanliang was particularly exquisite, reaching a wonderful realm. The couplet read, "The hardships of the past have made a far-reaching ambition, and today, a cup of wine comforts the heart of the loved one." It was most able to transcend the mundane. At 6:00 pm, everyone took their seats, and President Li of Jiaotong University also attended. Everyone vied to tease him to drink. Dr. Li Quanshi, an economist, happened to be present and was also affected. The sound of laughter filled the entire evening, reaching the outside. In the evening, the Peking Opera Troupe of Jiaotong University performed a gala, including "Chen Xizhi's Female Escort" and "Xu Houzhi's Iron Bow Marriage," all of which were extremely wonderful. The play ended late at night, and everyone returned home tipsy.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Future of Human Teeth <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>There is a European saying, "I hope we don't use our teeth too much." Its meaning is probably that chewing too much can harm the body, while dieting can often ward off illness. But studying human teeth, it is certain that the shape of the teeth and bones of modern men and women is indeed narrower than that of ancient people, and there is a tendency for them to become more and more delicate. Examining the reasons, it is not related to the amount of language used that causes changes, but rather the difference in food between ancient and modern people that has led to this.</p>
<p>A certain scientist who specializes in the study of dental problems once gave a speech, saying that the food we eat today is becoming increasingly soft, making it easier to digest and eliminating the need for chewing by the gums. Therefore, as the movement of the teeth is reduced, they will inevitably gradually degenerate and become narrow and delicate. However, this change actually makes the teeth appear more beautiful when women smile shallowly.</p>
<p>Sir Kader collected thousands of ancient and modern human skulls and jaws throughout his life. According to his report, the teeth of people from earlier times were generally large and sparse, strong and powerful, so fine teeth were rarely seen. This is because in ancient times, the food was not refined and was mostly coarse and tough. It was impossible to solve the problem of survival without the strength of the teeth. The teeth of the future are naturally continuing to change, but the extent to which they will change cannot be predicted at present. However, a certain scholar recently told someone that he imagined that a century from now, the teeth of human beings in the world will be as slender as a rabbit's. Although the words are humorous, they are also sufficient to show that human teeth are indeed becoming more and more delicate.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Mourning Ji Mei <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Meng</p>
<p>My old friend, Mr. Wang Meiqu (who later changed his name to Mei Ju), was a descendant of famous officials who accumulated virtue and had talent for writing. His works were numerous, and he enjoyed a reputation in the literary world. He maintained his career for decades without changing it. Even in poverty, he was content. He was over sixty years old, and his spirit was not diminished. I was hoping that he would live to be eighty or ninety years old. However, ten days ago, in the cold spring, the medicine stove had just been lit when he suddenly passed away on May 4, 1931, at his residence at 1178 Qian Shan Lane, Avenue Edward VII. He was sixty-six years old. Two days later, at the beginning of summer, his funeral was held at the Shanghai Lianyi Villa, where he was buried. Mr. Wang was a native of Haikang, Guangdong. On that day, the sky was covered with dark clouds, and heavy rain continued to fall. Many people held the ropes, and their clothes were soaked. Could it be that the so-called dust was cleared from the road to welcome Mr. Wang to the realm of immortals? I remember that I met Mr. Wang at the West Lake. Every time the plum blossoms were in full bloom, we would hold wine in Gushan. The wine stains on my clothes can still be clearly recognized today. Recently, Mr. Wang was employed by Mr. Du in Panyu. We met again in Shanghai and became even closer. For more than ten years, we shared our ideals and formed a friendship between teacher and friend. I deeply admired his humility and grace, which made him all the more admirable and approachable. He was a rare find. He must have obtained his carefree spirit from the mountains and forests. The wind turned the white banners, and I recalled his words and deeds. How could I not feel the loss of a person and a lyre? Mr. Wang never stopped reading for decades. He once said that it was the greatest joy to educate the talented people of the world. Therefore, he planted peach and plum trees in his vast courtyard. I once jokingly called him Mr. Jianzhai, but Mr. Wang modestly said, "I am not capable." I said, "Then you are higher than Jian." We laughed together. When I look back on it now, his words are still in my ears, but Mr. Wang has passed away. Mr. Wang was fond of drinking and eating, and he even made a food list. From now on, the spring mornings when we cut chives and the autumn nights when we held crabs will be most difficult. Where are my old friends? Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel sad. Life is like a dream, and the yellow beam is already ripe. I cannot help but feel sad for Mr. Wang, but also happy for him. The clothes, coffin, and burial ground were all willingly provided by Mr. Du. Everything was beautiful and complete in the southeast. The deceased rests peacefully in his resting place. If Mr. Wang is conscious in the underworld, he should be comforted. There are people in the world who are indifferent to their dead friends. How can they not be ashamed when they hear of this? Mr. Wang has two sons who will inherit his virtue and can be sure that they will not change their ways in three years. (Qiao Chou)</p>

<h3 id="e145">Travel Notes from India (49) <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Arrived in Allahabad at eleven o'clock. Staying at Professor Ranjan's house. I have been traveling through various parts of India for several months. Everywhere I look, there are countless PhDs. Hundreds of professors. It's not unusual to see hundreds of PhDs at a large gathering. They are all intellectuals. This class is generally also capitalist. They have cars and gardens. I think if they were to encounter Mr. Marx, they would definitely be in danger, because they are all capitalist and intellectual. However, I have a deep feeling. Even if the intellectual class does not encounter Mr. Marx, they are truly useless. Looking at the universities of India, they are like forests. PhDs are like leaves. But they cannot save the country from ruin, nor can they save the poor from starvation. Alas, education is bankrupt. PhDs are bankrupt. The intellectual class also declares itself bankrupt. India is truly worthy of being called a civilized country. No wonder they despise world culture, but Indians cannot solve politics. That is their shortcoming. Because historically they are not a political nation, but a religious nation. Indians have no political history. They do not pay attention to the rise and fall of dynasties. They only pay attention to religious philosophy. To this day, they are still a model teacher for all nations. How great. Alas. What about politics?</p>
<p>The twelfth. Met Indian leader Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi. He lives in the house of Motilal Nehru in Mati. Motilal Nehru has great power. Millions in wealth. And is an old friend of Gandhi. When I gave a lecture at the Allahabad Student Association, the students distributed flyers. Asking me to speak. The flyer boldly wished Motilal Nehru a long life. I didn't know why. Now I know that he is an important person working with Gandhi. Gandhi is the teacher. That he is the leader. But unfortunately, after the students wished him a long life, he died in Lucknow. He was seventy years old. All of India mourned. But his son can succeed his father. I first met his son. The son's name is Jawaharlal Nehru. Not yet thirty years old, very elegant. I heard that his wife is also strong. Jawaharlal Nehru has traveled to Russia. Rich in knowledge. Gandhi is still his teacher. Almost like assisting a young lord. Invisibly, it is the People's Government of India. Because there are great people behind Gandhi. I visited Gandhi. At nine o'clock in the morning. Many cars in front of the door. Professor Ranjan, in whose house I was staying, said. He has never been able to see Gandhi in his life. Because Gandhi has become the uncrowned king of all of India. In my life, I am most afraid of talking about equality. I said that the word equality was used by Rousseau in the eighteenth century as a tool to call on citizens to revolt against the government. To start a great revolution. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen was in Guangzhou, he had great difficulties because some people misunderstood it. In order to unite the masses. He created eight ranks to explain it. Now I meet Gandhi. Gandhi is of course an extremely equal uncrowned emperor. However, he lives in a large foreign building. Cars in front of the door are like clouds. University professors cannot even see him. Meeting time is extremely valuable. No different from headquarters. Alas. People who are superstitious about equality. That is why there are so many injustices in the world.</p>

<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>(4) The Necklace Problem</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhang Baoquan also realized the seriousness of the case and shifted his gaze. He re-examined the necklace on the table, then wrapped it up again with the white cloth. He asked me, "Mr. Bao, what do you think is the nature of this case? Could it be a robbery case?" I replied, "There are several possibilities here, all of which could be true. However, one of these possibilities is closest to the facts before us. I saw my aunt, Ms. Peifen, wearing a pearl necklace tonight. Since this bandit also came out of the Gao family's house, this thing is clearly my aunt's." Zhang Baoquan said, "This understanding is indeed very close. But the thing is already in his hands, why would he lightly throw it away? Even if he suspects someone is following him, he can simply throw the stolen goods somewhere hidden for later retrieval. Now that he has moved the stolen goods into your hands, hasn't he worked in vain?" I said, "This is his cunning. He handed the stolen goods to me, clearly to divert the pursuer's attention, making people believe that I am his accomplice. The pursuer's goal is primarily the stolen goods. He can naturally escape safely. Otherwise, not only might the stolen goods not be saved, but he himself would also be in danger of being arrested. He sees the light and heavy very clearly. His plan is really sinister. Hasn't old Mr. Qiu already fallen for his trick?" Zhang Baoquan nodded repeatedly, expressing his admiration for my insight. He said, "Then, the first step we should take is to make a phone call to the Gao family to ask. What do you think, Mr. Bao?" I replied, "This is the obvious thing to do. I was going to call when you came back. Let me call now."</p>
<p>But as I stood up to go to the office to make a call, I suddenly looked up and saw a person rushing into the office in a hurry. I looked closely and it was my good friend Hawthorne. At that moment, my spirit lifted, like an army trapped in heavy encirclement suddenly receiving reinforcements. The joy in my heart was indescribable. Zhang Baoquan quickly greeted him, "Ah, Mr. Hawthorne. Long time no see. Long time no see. I never expected you to grace us with your presence tonight." Hawthorne's face showed a serious expression. He stepped forward, shook hands with Zhang Baoquan, and stopped Baoquan's greetings, immediately getting to the heart of the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Speculative Silver Shows Weakness <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Transaction Volume Is Not High</p>
<p>Future Looks Uncertain</p>
<p>Falling Six Taels and Two Mace. Speculative silver prices have been slightly sluggish this past week, but without major changes. Coinciding with the Western merchants' spring horse racing season, traditionally the market is only open for half a day, so there was not much trading volume, and prices generally fluctuated around 740 taels, with daily swings of seven or eight taels. In short, people's minds are uncertain, especially with slight changes in overseas silver markets, and incessant rumors in the market. Since speculators and major players competed to buy on Tuesday, the price once rose to 744 taels and eight mace. By Friday, sellers became aggressive and suddenly fell to 731 taels, a total difference of 13 taels and eight mace. As a result, compared to the previous weekend, it fell by six taels and two mace. The London silver bar rose by 1.875, the American silver bar was even, and the Shanghai sterling exchange rate rose by half a cent (calculated as 1.25). The Japanese gold fell by 0.0125. The actual transaction prices of banks also tended to ease. Among colleagues, there was initial selling followed by slight buying, and the exchange rate was still about 40 taels higher than the daily settlement price. As for the May futures contracts, they have now been cleared, and the spot goods are mostly held by the Central Bank, approximately 20,000 contracts in total. Therefore, the rise and fall of speculative silver prices sometimes depends on the Central Bank's trading. Currently, companies such as Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yongheng, Yuancheng, Xinheng, and Yongfeng are all short, while Daxingyong, Chenfengyong, Yutian, Yong, Bingxing, and the Guangdong-based Hengxing and Shengda are all long. Spot firms are short futures and long spot goods. However, the future of speculative silver prices is still uncertain. The general situation of this week is summarized below.</p>
<p>Daily Variations Are Not Significant. Since Monday (May 4th) was the first day of the spring races, the London silver bar rose by 1.875, the silver price remained unchanged, and the shilling rate was stable. The internal market was loose. The opening price for June speculative silver fell slightly by 0.02 taels to 744.5 taels, and continued to fall by more than 7 taels due to many sellers, settling at 37.2 taels. The morning close was 7 taels and 7 mace, continuing to fall by 7 taels compared to the previous Saturday, a difference of 7 taels and 3 mace. Rumors were rampant, especially with a desperate sale by a major player named Luo. The market was closed the next day. The London silver bar shrunk by 0.0625, the American silver rose by 0.125, and the shilling rate rose by half a cent. The internal market was tight, a case of "loosening in name but tightening in reality." The gold market initially fell slightly by 0.07 taels to 37 taels. Later, Mr. Wu and others bought in, and the rumors subsided, breaking through the 40-tael barrier to 44 taels and eight mace. Yongfeng and the Guangdong group sold off, and the morning close was 41 taels, a rebound of 3 taels and 3 mace, with a difference of 7 taels and 8 mace. On Wednesday, the London silver bar rose again by 0.0625, the American silver price fell by 0.125, reversing the previous day's trend. The shilling rate remained unchanged, and the Japanese gold rate rose slightly by 0.025. The internal market was slightly loose. The industry sold shillings slightly, and the opening price for speculative silver added 1 tael to 42 taels, then remained flat, fluctuating by only one or two taels. It reached 42.9 taels. The bank absorbed 13,375 shillings. Suddenly, at noon, a storm arose. Yongfeng sold desperately on behalf of a certain firm, and Xinheng also sold. The exchange rate turned looser, suddenly falling by more than 7 taels to 35.3 taels. The closing price was 36 taels, falling back by 5 taels compared to the previous day, a difference of 7 taels and 6 mace in half a day. The next day, the London silver bar remained unchanged, the silver price added 0.125, the shilling rate was as before, and the internal market seemed to rise. Trading among various firms was uneven. The gold price initially stabilized at 36.5 taels, adding 0.05 taels. It then reached 39 taels. Luo and other major players dumped their holdings, only settling at 32.2 taels. The morning close rebounded by six or seven taels to 41.5 taels due to Mr. Wu buying in, then fell again when Mr. Wu sold off, and because the shilling rate was loose, the closing price was 34 taels, continuing to fall by 2 taels. There was a total of 9 taels and 3 mace fluctuation that day. The spring races were over, so there was a full day of trading. The next day, the London silver bar rose again by 0.0625, the American silver remained unchanged, and the shilling rate was peaceful both internally and externally. The opening price for speculative silver was 36.5 taels, immediately adding 2.5 taels, then 5 taels and 6 mace. Because major players were all buying in, and the shilling rate tightened, it reached 42.5 taels. Unexpectedly, news spread that there was a meeting abroad to maintain silver prices. The market sentiment plummeted, immediately losing 6 taels. The closing price was 36.2 taels. The selling pressure was even stronger in the afternoon, plummeting to 31 taels, falling for three consecutive days, totaling 2 taels (9 taels in total). The market had a total swing of 11.5 taels. On the weekend, the London silver bar shrunk by 0.0625, the American silver was lower by 0.125, the shilling rate remained unchanged, and the internal market was slightly firm. The gold market immediately rose, with the high reaching 39 taels. The London silver bar had been expected to rise the previous day, but it shrunk instead, so market sentiment turned upwards. The price then rose from 37 taels to 40.05 taels, but sellers were numerous and the shilling rate seemed loose, so it retreated to 36.5 taels. Chenfengyong bought in, pushing the price up by more than 3 taels to 39.8 taels. The morning close was 38.5 taels, rebounding by 6.5 taels compared to the previous day, a reversal of three consecutive days of decline. There was only a difference of 4 taels in half a day. The high and low prices of British, American, Indian silver markets and exchange rates are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday (Sunday), as usual, all foreign banks, both Chinese and foreign, were closed, and there were no reports on financial or foreign exchange markets. However, according to London telegraphs, London spot silver continued to fall, with both near-term and long-term shrinking by 0.0625, both to 13 125/1000 pence. There was slight selling from India, and Chinese bankers bought in. The market was flat with little trading. In addition, according to New York telegraphs, the American silver price also continued to shrink by 0.125, settling at 28 125/1000 cents. The British to American rate fell by 0.0625 to $4.863213, and the American to British rate fell by 0.03125 to $4.864375. The Japanese to American rate remained at $49.41.

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the banks were closed, so the market was quiet. However, the downward trend of the foreign silver dollar price has not stopped. The morning price was 7 mace 2 fen 7 li 8 hao 7 hu ban, which was 0.0025 lower than the previous day's afternoon price. The afternoon price continued to fall by 0.005 li, to 7 mace 2 fen 7 li 3 hao 7 hu ban. Overall, it fell by 0.0075 compared to the previous day's afternoon price. Silver and cash markets were both open for lending, and foreign exchange remittances were made. The morning transaction was 765,000, and the afternoon transaction was 610,000. There was no trading in banknotes either inside or outside the market. Qianzhuang foreign firms received over 3.8 million, and silver firms received over 33 million. Remittances from various routes were over 500,000, and small qianzhuang transactions were over 300,000. In the auxiliary currency market, the morning and afternoon prices of Jiangnan small foreign dollars were the same, at 6 mace 5 fen 3 li ban. There was no trading in either market.

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3 id="e150">Yarn Market Follows the Trend of Improvement This Past Week <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Price Increased by Four to Five Taels Each Month</p>
<p>Spot Sales Remained Weak Due to the Busy Farming Season</p>
<p>The yarn market situation in the first part of last week was affected by various rumors, and the American cotton market was weak. Generally, retailers were bearish and there were more sellers. Before long, foreign yarn prices rose, rumors subsided, and buyers' attitudes became more positive. Also, raw material costs were high, manufacturers were already in distress and loss, and there were rumors of layoffs. As a result, those who had sold based on the political situation saw the environment improve, and actively bought back their positions. The market began to rise. Speculative yarn results showed that each month rose by four to five taels compared to the previous week. The total volume of transactions for the entire week was 165,050 bales. Spot yarn sales remained weak due to the busy farming season in various villages. Total purchases by various groups for the entire week were 6,935 bales. Internal trading among colleagues was 2,400 bales, with prices rising by three, four, or five taels, depending. Japanese factories opened 14,000 bales of 20-count yarn. Osaka's three-brand yarn rose by eight or nine yuan compared to the previous week. If the political situation remains stable next week, the yarn market is likely to rise. However, most people are mentally prepared to sell when prices rise.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Satisfactory Results in the Cotton Market Last Week <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Prices Rose High by One Tael and Five or Six Mace... Spot Demand Was Very Quiet</p>
<p>The cotton market was weak at the beginning of the week. American cotton fell below the one-dollar mark. At the same time, the yarn market was hit by the political situation and collapsed. Yarn factories faced extreme difficulties and layoffs were rumored. However, Japanese merchants kept prices tight because inventories were low and sources were scarce in various regions. The market was fundamentally strong, and American cotton began to rise again. Retailers were excited by this. There were also rumors that Hankou yarn factories were coming to Shanghai to purchase raw materials. Buyers' pressure increased. Speculative cotton prices rose by one tael and five or six mace compared to the previous week. The total volume of transactions was 411,700 dan. The sources included 2,400 bales of Yao cotton and 300 bales of Tong cotton. Spot cotton transactions at various factories were quiet. American cotton rose by 65 pounds compared to the previous week. The number of bales purchased by various factories is listed below:</p>
<p>Manufacturer Purchase Highest Price Lowest Price Transaction Quantity Delivery PeriodNanshi Chemical 38.25 ... 100 bales Spot Delivery to FactoryBao Hua 51.50 50.25 250 pieces Spot Delivery to FactoryShaanxi Cotton 41.50 40.75 350 pieces Spot Delivery to FactoryHigh Quality Cotton 38.25 ... 100 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was stable and firm due to good news from Liverpool and purchases by industry peers. Futures rose by one to two pounds, and spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton, both futures and spot, rose by 10 points. Indian cotton opened firm and rose, and the closing was stable. Phalghat and Oomra rose by six rupees, and White Row Creek rose by five rupees. Original telegrams are recorded on the left (9th telegram).</p>

<p>The market for woolen fabrics has continued to fall recently, and the trend of the Tongyi Association is extremely weak. The reason for this is that buyers' demand is scarce, and the market is flooded with goods. Sellers are being urged to sell by foreign firms and pressured by the need to pay margins for rollovers. They are eager to get rid of their goods, and they are competing to sell, so prices are falling day by day. Yesterday's market prices, except for rubber-lined raincoats and flannel white serge and white straight cotton, all other flannels, straight serge, Walter flannel, satin, and covert cloth, all gradually fell in price. Mixed-color serge and plaid Walter flannel fell even more sharply. Yesterday, first-grade mixed-color plaid Walter flannel uniformly reduced the selling price by 4 taels 4 mace and a half, second-grade 4 taels 1 mace, covert cloth at the same price, single-sided open-water wholesale 5 taels, retail 5 taels 0.025 fen.</p>

<p>Western Merchants Were on Holiday for the Spring Races... Overseas Telegrams to Shanghai Were Sparse</p>
<p>Japanese Silk Competed with Low Prices... Exchange Rate Rise and the Price Became Increasingly Weak</p>
<p>During the week, the local Shanghai silk market was weak due to the spring races. Foreign firms were on holiday for the spring races, and there were only four days of trading throughout the week. Overseas silk sales were sluggish, and telegrams were sparse. In addition, the inventories of Japanese silk in Yokohama were still high. Japanese merchants wanted to clear out old silk and received subsidies from the Japanese government. They did not hesitate to lower prices for sales. In the European and American markets, Japanese silk competed with low prices, which increased the pressure. Also, the exchange rate rose during the week, and Chinese silk prices became increasingly weak. Spring silkworms in various regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were mostly damaged by cold rain, and a bumper harvest was unlikely. Silk merchants are watching the cocoon harvest. The new cocoons in Hangzhou and Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province are about to enter the market, but there is no preparation for departure. The number of cocoon stores rented out is less than 20%. The total spot silk transactions for the week were only over 100 bales, and exports were over 700 bales. Overseas silk prices were nominally flat but secretly falling. The overseas Chinese silk prices at the end of last week are listed below (New York: price per pound, unit US dollars; Lyon: price per kilogram, unit Francs):</p>

<p>Heavy Rain for Two Days... Silkworms Mostly Excreted Yellow and Died</p>
<p>Pinghu's silkworm farmers are mostly raising improved varieties of early silkworms this year. However, due to the cold weather after the first sleep, white muscardine was discovered. When raising late silkworms, the weather was still very cold, and there was continuous spring rain, which was unfavorable for development. The early silkworms have now completed their third sleep and are sufficiently leafy. Some have even completed their large sleep. Unexpectedly, with two days of heavy rain, the silkworms all excreted yellow and were discarded, accounting for about 60%. This year's silkworm harvest is likely to be a bubble.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Straw Mushrooms and Winter Mushrooms Rise and Fall Differently <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The arrival of straw mushrooms is gradually increasing, and prices are falling according to market reports. Prices in Shanghai are also declining daily due to reduced arrivals and weak sales. Yesterday, Tianjin firms opened a price of 575 taels for North straw mushrooms, down to 560 taels, and a price of 570 taels for Mouth Ding straw mushrooms, down to 558 taels. Compared to the market in early May, each grade has fallen sharply by 20 to 30 taels. Also, because the firms want to sell the available goods, they are unusually lazy to sell, so beware of further declines.</p>
<p>The new domestic winter mushrooms have been arriving. Later batches are fewer. Yesterday, the hoarding price rose to 268.5 taels. There are not many oriental mushrooms in the market. Currently, merchants in the market are selling Three Jade seal for 358 taels, Three Treasure seal for 343 taels, Chrysanthemum seal for 336 taels, and Flower Posture seal for 345 taels. Local firms and the Guanghan group are planning to purchase.</p>

<p>Spring round mushrooms are scarce and the supply is limited. Recently, it was reported that the Xinyuan An ship brought a batch, totaling only 247 boxes. As a result, firms are even more interested in purchasing, and the prices have risen by two or three taels compared to before. The first grade is priced from 31.5 taels to 29 taels, and the second grade is priced from 27.5 taels to 25, 26 taels, and 22, 23 taels, depending on the quality. Middle grades are priced from 20 taels to 12, 13 taels. The buying interest is unusually strong.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3 id="e158">Outline of Central Banking System <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>Published by Datong Bookstore</p>
<p>A nation's wealth and strength rely on adequate economic income and development. Moreover, the circulation of finance is of utmost importance. This is the reason for the establishment of various banking industries. Central banks are positioned in contrast to local banks and are distinguished from general banks by whether or not they have special privileges. Therefore, they are also called national banks or banks of banks. There are many interpretations of their meaning among scholars. The essential ones can be divided into four theories: (1) A central bank is the highest financial institution in a country and the center of all banks. This is the most common explanation. It means that every undertaking must have a supreme body to administer and guide it. The financial industry is particularly important. If handled improperly, its impact will ripple through the entire economic structure. The central bank leads the nation's finance, is the most complete institution in the banking system, and is located in the central hub. It constantly directs the operations of various banks, leading to national financial unity, which can be effective. This theory is relatively vague. (2) A central bank has the privilege of issuance and stands above general banks as the financial center of a country. This explanation by Japanese scholar Hidematsu Tsumura also has the drawback of being biased and incomplete. (3) The central bank reduces the responsibilities borne by general banks and restricts their powers. These are the words of American banking scholar Dunbar, which are more appropriate. (4) A central bank usually enjoys the monopoly of issuance, has a large number of branches, and is supervised by the government as an agent of the national treasury. This is the theory of J. Holdsworth, but it also fails to clarify the true meaning of a central bank. However, centralization is a necessary means adopted in modern national politics. Why should economics be any different? In today's world of ever-increasing transportation, a nation's economic prosperity or decline cannot be achieved by focusing on trivial details. Without centralizing national financial affairs, it is not possible to regulate them properly and exert the highest degree of control. Therefore, if a nation wants to concentrate financial power, it must grant various privileges to banks with great power, authorize them to engage in operations beneficial to the public, maintain and support them, and increase their authority to manipulate national finance. It should focus on the prosperity, decline, safety, and danger of the nation as a whole. When the market is in panic, it stabilizes it; when the treasury is in crisis, it rescues it, serving as the linchpin of national credit. After the collapse of the feudal system, a strong government was created in politics, and a strong bank also emerged in the financial world. This is the inevitable trend of responding to changes in the world and cannot be resisted. Here, the author offers a more definitive statement based on general interpretations:</p>
<p>A central bank occupies the highest position in a country's financial world, enjoys special rights, has a very close relationship with the state, does not seek private gain, and bears the great responsibility of maintaining and rescuing national credit. Therefore, it guides general banks, maintains the economy, and benefits the nation.</p>
<p>This interpretation of the meaning of a central bank may not fully conform to theory, but it seems to facilitate a comprehensive understanding. Regarding this, the author elaborates on it very clearly in the opening chapter of this book, making it known that a central bank has an important relationship with the state. Secondly, the functions of the central bank are briefly enumerated and divided into twelve items: (1) It can enhance the effectiveness of currency; (2) It can regulate finance; (3) It can conduct discounting; (4) It can use discount policy to stabilize finance; (5) It can cope with huge expenditures; (6) It is easy to implement banking policies; (7) It is easy to examine the national financial situation; (8) It can invigorate the operations of various localities; (9) It can develop credit transactions; (10) It can issue banknotes; (11) It can act as an agent of the national treasury; (12) It can assist national finances. In this way, we can get a glimpse of the meaning and functions of a central bank, and we can also have a concrete understanding of how it differs from general banks.</p>
<p>Since China has had a banking organization, it has been more than twenty years. Banking regulations have also been revised repeatedly. However, in practice, the banking industry has no system to speak of. Therefore, we can understand that the lack of a central banking system to lead the financial world has led to the proliferation of small-scale banks, numbering no less than one hundred. Although there are one or two with greater strength, their funds are still insufficient, and their operations are underdeveloped. They are unable to cope with the industry in the country, which is about to be revitalized. Since the National Government passed the Central Bank Ordinance on October 5, 1928, and officially established the Central Bank, the banking industry seems to have the hope of being rectified. However, in reality, it is not perfect. Because it coincides with the beginning of political reform and the establishment of a system, although there is no lack of commendable points, there are still many traces of compromise. Moreover, authority is chaotic, foreign power is strong, business is uneconomical, laws are not enforced, and general credit assistance institutions are not yet perfect. Furthermore, the war is not over, and the Communist bandits are destroying the rural economic organization, making it difficult to use funds. Here, the author studies the central bank of China based on the current situation and divides it into five points:</p>
<p>1. It is urgent to unify authority. The special rights enjoyed by the Central Bank are the issuance of banknotes and acting as an agent of the national treasury. These special rights should be granted by the government to ensure its exclusive enjoyment. Only then can the measures and facilities of the Central Bank achieve neat and uniform effects. In this way, in times of financial and fiscal distress, it can devote all its efforts to deal with it. However, if we examine the Central Bank of China, it nominally adopts a single system, but in addition to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks such as the Frontier Bank, the Industrial Bank, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the Mongolian and Tibetan Bank, and the Salt Bank also enjoy a portion of the agency privileges. As for the reorganization of banknote issuance, it is of course more important to rely on the prestige of the National Government. The banking system will be established within ten years. We should learn from the National Bank system of the United States before the European War and the United Reserve Bank system after the war, so that the speed of improvement is fast, and we should strive to do things without violating the general trend of the world and considering the domestic situation to achieve early success. 2. Business operations must be improved. Due to the depression of industry and poor credit in China, general banks either have no business to operate or are poorly managed, and they are generally on the road to failure. Therefore, general banks are competing to raise interest rates to absorb deposits, and at the same time, they are taking chances on investments to seek high profits. However, the Central Bank should not do this. That is to say, commercial banks should be commercialized, special banks should be specialized, and the Central Bank should be centralized to invigorate the nation's finance. 3. Foreign power must be eliminated urgently. Foreign banks in China, such as HSBC, Banque de l'Indochine, and Yokohama Specie Bank, are indeed hindering the national economy and the development of the Central Bank. Therefore, since the nature of the Central Bank is certain and has a strict organization, we only need to have a solid guarantee for the faithful fulfillment of foreign debts to crack down on the hegemony of foreign banks. What about the safety of keeping the funds? Now that politics is on track and the international status is increasing, we must pay attention to this, especially during the period of political tutelage and construction. 4. Laws should be implemented quickly. Since the establishment of the National Government, the Legislative Yuan has formulated various civil and commercial codes. At the time of the Central Bank's initial venture, the national economy was in a state of decline. These codes should be promulgated and implemented by the National Government as soon as possible. Then, all enterprises will obtain considerable guarantees and guidelines, the economy will naturally become super-developed, and the Central Bank can use appropriate policies to achieve unparalleled macro effects. 5. Advocate credit assistance institutions. Modern economic and social organizations are complex. If you want to develop, you must connect and help each other. The Central Bank is in a leading position and should bear the responsibility of advocating, setting up, and assisting auxiliary institutions and engaging in liaison. According to the auxiliary institutions of the bank, the most important ones are the Clearing House and the Enquiring Association. The author will also describe this in detail. Secondly, it is said that although China's central banking system is in its infancy, a careful analysis of its regulations reveals many satisfactory points, and it is also analyzed. This is indeed the most practical chapter in the study of China's central bank and is very valuable.</p>
<p>This book focuses on analysis and research, so the author discusses all aspects of the central bank in chapters. The evolution of central banks in various countries is only briefly described in the second chapter, including the process of establishment, the raising of capital, and the enjoyment of special rights. The organization, business, and financial manipulation policies of other central banks are discussed in chapters. It is indeed the most accurate book for studying the central banking system. It is particularly detailed about China and should be paid attention to.</p>

<p>— Man Yin</p>
<p>Volume 2, Issue 1, Special Oversized Issue</p>
<p>"Asia is one of the five continents. In terms of area, Asia is the eldest brother. In terms of population, Asia is also the most. In terms of products, Asia also has inexhaustible resources... All the ethnic groups in Asia can stand on the roof of the world and say to all mankind, we Asians are the largest continent, our Asian history and culture are the most ancient, our Asian position and situation are the most majestic, we Asians should occupy the leading position among the five continents, we Asians should be in a leading position for the people of other continents.</p>
<p>But what is the actual position of the Asian continent? What is the position of the Asian people? All the ethnic groups in Asia are under severe oppression, and all the ethnic groups in Asia are in danger of extinction. The life of the Asian people is really like a thread!</p>
<p>China is the largest ethnic group in Asia. China's decline is the cause of the decline of all ethnic groups in Asia. China's misfortune and failure are the cause of the misfortune and failure of all ethnic groups in Asia. Therefore, the China issue is the hub of all ethnic issues in Asia. China's revitalization is the starting point for the revitalization of Asian ethnic groups..."</p>
<p>The above is the declaration of the inaugural issue of New Asia Monthly. Indeed, judging from the current situation, the life of the Asian people is like a thread. Asian culture has entered a path of degradation. Among them, China is the most, and China is the largest country in Asia. Her rise and fall are enough to shift everything in Asia. Therefore, to save Asia from decline, we must first start with the transformation of China, awaken the national consciousness of the people, and plan to build a great country with equality among five ethnic groups. This is a fact that everyone should acknowledge.</p>
<p>Based on this point, the birth of Asia began with research on the terrain, culture, politics, economy... of various Asian countries, past and present conditions, which is indeed something to be congratulated. The publication has now been published to Volume 2, Issue 1. Because it is a special oversized issue, articles on Asia - especially on the Chinese borderlands - are particularly abundant. They include Dai Jitao's general solution to the three problems of the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest; Wei Chongyang's translation of The Precarious Manchurian-Mongolian Railway; Ma Quetian's A Glimpse of Outer Mongolia; Yu Quji's Cultivation of Wasteland in Xinjiang and Future Plans; Yang Zhonghua's Overview of Xikang; Zhang Fuzhen's Yunnan under French Imperialist Aggression; Li Shaoyun's Opening of Zhongshan Port and the Future of Southern China; Hua Qihua's The Topography of Eastern Nationalities and Their Revolutionary Movements; Chen Liepu's The Chinese National Movement on the International Stage of the Far East; Luo Jincheng's The Overseas Development of the Chinese Nation in the Past Century; Fang Baohan's India after the Round Table Conference; Wei Juezhong's The Scholars of the South Seas Dimuli Lilli under the Oppression of the Portuguese; Guo Shizhen's An Overview of Taiwan's Industry under the Power of Japanese Capital; and Chen Dazhong's Industry in Siberia, a total of fourteen articles, totaling more than 200,000 words. After reading it, I really gained a lot of knowledge. The essentials are introduced as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Precarious Manchurian-Mongolian Railway</p>
<p>The Manchurian-Mongolian Railway is the most important business run by Japan to invade my Northeast, and it is also the general hub of economic power that Japan has grasped in the Northeast. Since its construction, it has dominated my Northeast for the past twenty-five years, and its business has been extremely prosperous, known as the "Manchurian Railway King." However, since the spring of last year, the situation has suddenly changed, and income has decreased, which is unprecedented. It is estimated that from April to August of last year</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>At the end of the month, the railway revenue decreased by about 30 million yuan. Japan, which regards the Manchurian Railway as the life of the empire, discovered such a serious regression, so the government and the public were in turmoil, and the whole country was frenzied, seeking ways to provide relief. The author of this article, Tatsubun Takeuchi, was one of those sent to the Northeast by the Japanese government to investigate. Because of this, his remarks are very representative of the ambition of the entire Japanese imperialism to invade my Northeast. His design is to penetrate deep into the heart of my Northeast, which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>He analyzes the reasons why the revenue of the Manchurian Railway has decreased: 1. Due to the sharp drop in the price of silver; 2. China has made a planned resistance. Based on these reasons, he thought of a way to deal with it, which is quite alarming to us.</p>
<p>The Northeast was originally our country's territory. Because it could not withstand the oppression of Japan, it was just planning to build a railway to resist foreigners, but it was opposed by the Japanese. Isn't this the same as having your own things snatched away by a robber, and not even being allowed to say a word? Although the author does not agree with the "rescue, resort to the final means as soon as possible" of the Japanese residents who advocate war to treat me, he advocates "seeking a way for China and Japan to cooperate with each other in the railway, and discovering opportunities for diplomatic solutions." This is a policy that our people should pay attention to. The translation of this article in this publication has to be said to be an important thesis.</p>
<p>(2) A Glimpse of Outer Mongolia</p>
<p>The author of this article has traveled to Mongolia for a long time, so what he says is of course true. The full text is divided into three paragraphs. First, an overview of Outer Mongolia's finances is divided into one, customs duties; two, progressive property taxes; three, population donations and occupational donations; four, business donations and stamp duties; five, carriage and horse donations and rent donations; six, banking currency system, which describes the financial income of Outer Mongolia in great detail. The second paragraph describes the oppression of Han people in the mouths of Han merchants, just like heavy taxes, arbitrary fines, arbitrary interference, abuse, expulsion... all kinds of unequal treatment are really outrageous. The third paragraph, the attitude of the Han people towards the Three People's Principles, explains that ignorant Han merchants, because they indirectly received abuse from the Red Russians, suspected the Three People's Principles to be communism, and their stupidity is both pitiful and sighable. Usually, we always recognize Mongolia as our country's territory. However, judging from the facts stated in this article, Mongolia is simply like an enemy country to us.</p>
<p>(3) Yunnan under French Imperialist Aggression</p>
<p>From the perspective of Yunnan's position in national defense and international affairs, and the past and present social conditions, this article explains the ambition and attempt of French imperialists to invade. We indeed acknowledge that this article is an important thesis. In the introduction, the author tells us that Yunnan is the largest province in China, with an area of more than 107,900 square miles, fertile land, mild climate, abundant nonferrous metals, and rich animal husbandry. It is truly the so-called "unique natural endowment." However, recently, due to wars, bandits, corrupt officials, and dirty officials... all kinds of man-made disasters have brought the people of Yunnan to the brink of despair. The invasion of French imperialists has made Yunnan a meat on the chopping board and a fish in the cauldron. If the people of Yunnan do not become strong themselves, and the government does not pay attention, it will not stop until Yunnan is sent into the hands of foreigners. Later, the author listed the facts of French imperialists invading Yunnan, such as (A) in terms of politics and economy, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Company is managed by French people, and the post and telecommunications are still inseparable from the control of French people. Banque de l'Indochine holds the general hub of finance in the province. In addition, there are more foreign firms and companies than can be counted. The most bizarre thing is the militarization of the Yunnan-Vietnam Road, the increase of French police on the road, and the storage of gunpowder at the station, which is unpredictable. (B) Population oppression, the migration of large numbers of Annam people, making Yunnan suffer from overpopulation. (C) Cultural aggression, the detectives of Catholic teachers, and the increase of schools that manufacture foreign slaves. (D) Territorial encroachment, encroaching on our land across the border... All of this is really unimaginable to us. Yunnan is nominally one of the eighteen provinces of China, but in reality, it is so oppressed by imperialism. The author later discussed the way for the people of Yunnan to save themselves, should support the central government, fully develop national consciousness, and specifically pointed out seven positive and negative measures. We acknowledge that they are very appropriate.</p>
<p>(4) The Chinese National Movement on the International Stage of the Far East</p>
<p>This is a treatise discussing the international political situation, explaining the relationship between the Chinese national movement on the international stage of the Far East. The first paragraph, National Movement and Diplomacy, points out the necessity of diplomacy in the national movement, and cites the independence of North America, the unification of Italy after 1849, and the unification of Germany by Bismarck, none of which were achieved without diplomacy. The second paragraph, Ninety Years of Passive Diplomacy, points out the failure of Chinese diplomacy in modern times. A. The Chinese diplomacy in the period from the Opium War to the Sino-Japanese War, its driving force was the result of the imperialists' demand for trade. B. The Sino-Japanese War to the Boxer Rebellion was the diplomacy during the period of imperialist military aggression. C. From the Boxer Rebellion to the European War, it was the diplomacy of investment and aggression by the powers. The third paragraph, The Policies of the Powers towards China and their Conflicts, analyzes in detail the facts and interests of imperialists such as Britain, Japan, the United States, and Russia towards China. Because of this, the author affirms the direction of Chinese diplomacy said in the fourth paragraph, which must take Japan as a hypothetical enemy, unite with the United States to reject Britain, be friendly with Germany to prevent France, and give sufficient reasons. We cannot but acknowledge that it is correct. The fifth paragraph, The Brewing of the Second World War and the Preparations that China Should Make, points out that China, for the sake of national survival, should mobilize the whole people for preparations during the Second World War, and recognize that war is beneficial to our nation. It is concise, to the point, and extremely correct.</p>
<p>(5) The Savages of the South Seas under Portuguese Oppression in East Timor</p>
<p>The author, Mr. Wei Juezhong, is a traveler who has traveled alone to the South Seas Islands for seven years and has written a book "The Peoples of the Southern Wilderness." The reporter has introduced it in this publication. This article, "The Savages of the South Seas under Portuguese Oppression in East Timor," is still his work when he traveled to the South Seas. First, it describes the topography and location of East Timor, which is one of the Lesser Sunda Islands, with a wide jurisdiction. The northeast, south, and east are all facing the sea. Secondly, it describes the political situation of the Portuguese administration of Dili, the political orders are not implemented, and the officials are corrupt. Finally, there is the life of the savages, who are good at riding horses and produce abundant coffee, which is concise and interesting.</p>
<p>In addition to these important treatises, this publication also has a column "Asian Garden," which, according to the editor, "specializes in publishing the customs and poems of various parts of Asia," with the intention of focusing on interest, so as to avoid readers feeling boring and tasteless. The works published in this issue, such as Ge Ran Zeren's Tribute from Nepal in the Past and Wei Juezhong's Anti-Prison Notes from the South Island, can all be based on this purpose.</p>
<p>Looking at the various treatises in this issue, they all aim to dedicate themselves to the revival of Asia and discuss various issues related to Asia, focusing on the attention to the Chinese borderlands and the discussion of Eastern ethnic groups. This is naturally because, as mentioned above, China is the largest country in Asia, and China's rise and fall can shift the entire Asian context. However, in the past, we have not found a publication that focuses specifically on the examination of such issues. Because of this, this publication is indeed worth recommending.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the editors and authors of this publication will continue to work tirelessly. I especially hope that all Asian ethnic groups - especially the Chinese people - will pay attention to various issues related to the survival of Asia, and rise up to implement the Asian Ethnic Congress and jointly shout -</p>
<p>The whole of Asia has been revived!</p>

<h3 id="e162">Athletics at Great China University <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Han</p>
<p>In the past, Great China University's athletics were indeed relatively quiet, but since moving to the new campus in the autumn of the nineteenth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930], it seems that the spirit has been invigorated. It was indeed regrettable that they narrowly missed winning the Group B championship in last winter's West Qing basketball tournament (because the championship was held during the winter vacation, and many players had returned home, so they had to make do with players from the second team, and although they were defeated by Shanghai University, the score difference was very small), but they were able to defeat the extremely fierce combined team of St. John's Middle School—the youth team—in the Shanghai basketball tournament's Group B championship, which was no small consolation. And the recent vigor seems to have the momentum of advancing a thousand miles a day. (It is said that Xi Xuemin and others in the youth team were originally famous players from St. John's in Shanghai, and Lin Zequn, Hou Youliang, etc. were also first-class players from the university department. Mr. Hou also represented the Chinese team at the Shanghai International Basketball Tournament last year.)</p>
<p>In short, when I think of Great China University's athletics, I only feel that it is full of vigor, and it seems worthwhile to publish something about how strong its future strength will be.</p>
<p>First Volleyball Team: Holding the ambition to swallow up the south of the Yangtze River, although they lost to Jiangwan University in the first round of the Shih Pao Cup by a very small margin, that was when they had just formed the team, and there were some regrettable issues with coordination, as evidenced by the many missed balls in that game. But consider the subsequent friendly matches against Jinan University, Jiaotong University, the Law and Politics Department, St. John's University, the Central Political School, and the Chih Tze School, all of which were won by 3-0. In short, the Great China University volleyball team is unrivaled by any other school in Shanghai today, except for Fudan University, and even Fudan University is just a matter of luck—why not meet today!—and the even distribution of talent in the Great China University team is even more rare. The saves of Zhu Anmin, Lin Rangsen, Zhou Xiongwei, and Guan Pan'an, the spikes of Wei Dingyi and Wei Zuohan, and the sets of Ren Jiexing, etc., are all rare talents. And especially Wei Dingyi's spikes are even more powerful, often making the enemy tremble with fear.</p>
<p>Second Tennis Team: The Great China University tennis team, which won the championship in its first year of participating in the Jiangnan University Sports Association, was indeed a surprise and gave the people of Shanghai a good impression. Last year (the second year of Great China University's joining Jiangnan University), they defeated Central University and Jiaotong University in a row by 4-1, but ultimately failed to win the championship in the final, which was very regrettable. In the morning, Shen Meizhen and Guo Pengnian won two singles matches in a row, but in the two doubles matches in the afternoon, they lost two games in a row due to uneven pairings. If Shen and Guo could have been paired up for doubles, then the championship would not have been difficult. In short, this was not a fault of the players, but a problem with the sports director's strategy. Let's not dwell on the past and see who will win the championship in the upcoming tournament.</p>
<p>Third Basketball Team: The abundance of basketball talent here can be said to be second to none in the south of the Yangtze River. In addition to the original "locomotive" Kang Yuefa, "iron gate" Hu Mingxin, veteran Zhao Jiabin (a famous long-range shooter, but he will lack practice in the coming year), and other six or seven players, there is also Ren Jiexing, who is good at both attack and defense, and recently they have added several fierce generals from the "cannon team" who defeated Chih Tze, Qingguang, and Zhenru, making their strength even a hundred times stronger. They are just about to test their mettle. Unfortunately, the generals in the Jiangnan University basketball tournament could not participate due to eligibility issues, but they were still able to defeat Jiaotong University, Central University, Guanghua University, and the Central Public School in a row, which shows their strength.</p>
<p>Fourth Women's Basketball Team: Although it is their first time forming a team, their rapid progress is surprising. The fact that they defeated Chih Tze by 2-4 the other day is just a minor matter. Looking at their quick passing and brave attacking on that day, they are worthy of being a strong rival to Jinan University in the future.</p>
<p>Fifth Track and Field Team: The team includes Fang Sixu and Hu Mingxin, who specialize in shot put, discus, and javelin; He Debao, who specializes in sprinting; Long Zexian and Hu Dingli, who specialize in long-distance running; Wu Jinqi, who specializes in high jump; Guan Jiachang, who specializes in hurdles; and Lu Weikun and Zheng Bilian in the women's team, totaling no less than thirty or forty people, who are indeed a strong force. In addition to many team members being strong athletes from the Baihong and Jiangnan teams, Mr. Long was also a representative of China in last year's Far East Games. In the recent long-distance race organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, Mr. Long unfortunately had just recovered from a recent illness, and his strength was inevitably weakened, but he was still able to win the top prize (third place), which is no easy feat.</p>
<p>Other teams, such as the baseball team, are also practicing diligently. The famous Ren Jiexing is certainly extraordinary, but the other talents have not been able to show their skills because they still lack formal practice.</p>
<p>In short, the strength of Great China University is truly worth celebrating, and the upcoming expedition to Nanjing and Suzhou for track and field events will surely give us a better impression. Strive on!</p>

<p>— Ling Xiao</p>
<p>Since Mr. He Shizhen founded Chih Tze College, he has strived for progress. A new school building is currently being built on Shuidao Road, costing hundreds of thousands of yuan, and is expected to be completed before the summer vacation. Recently, Principal He specially invited Mr. Wu Jingxiong, a lecturer at Harvard University and Northwestern University in the United States, to come to the school every Thursday from 4:00 to 6:00 to give lectures on the following topics: (1) The Art of Law, (2) Recent Trends in Western Law, (3) The Dispute Between Legalists and Confucians, (4) The Moral Components in Our Country's Old Legal System, (5) Cosmic Philosophy in Our Country's Old Legal System, (6) Six Periods in the History of Criminal Law in Our Country, (7) The Logic of "That's Terrible" in Judicial Adjudication, (8) Law and Nation, (9) Law and Civil Rights, (10) Law and People's Livelihood, which will be completed in ten lectures. Before Mr. Wu arrived at the college, all senior students prepared paper and pens and waited in the auditorium. Soon, Principal He and Secretary He accompanied Mr. Wu to the auditorium, and the hall resounded with applause. After Principal He introduced him, Mr. Wu took the stage and began his lecture, which was extremely brilliant, and all listeners admired him greatly.</p>

<p>The Jiangnan College Bell Sound Society took only two weeks from preparation to establishment, and its planning has already been completed. It is reported that the executive committee has recently begun work. It is said that the society has appointed Ling Xianwen, Liu Zhujing, and Meng Xinmin as standing committee members, Cao Hanfang as the head of the general affairs department, Shao Rongjiu as the deputy, Jiang Zixuan as the head of the research department, Peng Ming as the deputy, Gu Jiwu as the head of the publication department, and Jin Caiqiao as the deputy. They have also hired Luo Xiuyun, Ying Yao, Yan Jiahua, and others to serve as group leaders in various groups, and they will intensify their work from now on, planning to publish publications on academic research in the shortest possible time, and inviting famous scholars to give lectures, paying close attention to both natural sciences and social sciences.</p>
<h3 id="e165">One Morning <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>"Tangyuan Xishi [Dumpling Beauty]", this is a very attractive name. Not only are the male students in the universities near her residence crazy about her, but even the female students want to take the opportunity to admire her praised round and beautiful dimples. I am one of them.</p>
<p>It was a Friday morning. I had eaten porridge and was standing by the window idly holding a teacup when Xiang, who was sitting across from me, suddenly said,</p>
<p>"Yu, let's go to Baoshan now and see Tangyuan Xishi." Her face was full of happy smiles.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's call Ying and go together." This interesting suggestion brought my soul back from its immersion in humor.</p>
<p>So the three of us walked towards that long, black, sandy road. Gray clouds densely covered the sky, and a sea breeze mixed with sand and dust hit our faces. At this time, although we all felt a bit cold, we weren't discouraged - just thinking of that smile - that smile that made people happy - and still bravely and enthusiastically moved forward.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's raining," Xiang said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm getting a little wet too," I said anxiously.</p>
<p>"Don't argue," Ying comforted us, "we're almost there, almost at the tangyuan shop. Let's hurry and run there to take shelter from the rain."</p>
<p>At this time, the rain was getting heavier and heavier. We ran silently and quickly on the road.</p>
<p>Not far after entering the city gate, Ying pointed to a black-doored house in front and said, "Here we are, that's Xishi's house."</p>
<p>"There's no one at the door, it's so quiet it doesn't look like a pastry shop."</p>
<p>"Are we in the wrong place?" I said doubtfully. "I really don't believe that the tangyuan shop that everyone is talking about is so deserted."</p>
<p>"It can't be wrong, I've been here before, it's definitely right," Ying said firmly.</p>
<p>We walked into the shop. A woman in her forties was standing in front of the table chopping meat. The smile we braved the wind and rain to find was not there, indeed not there. Our eyes, like mice looking for food, searched everywhere with eager light, in the room, in the courtyard...</p>
<p>We asked the woman tentatively, "Tangyuan, we're here to eat tangyuan."</p>
<p>"She took them out to sell, she just left," the woman replied.</p>
<p>"Then... is there any..." Xiang seemed about to say something else.</p>
<p>I tugged at her shoulder, "Let's go, people will be suspicious." Xiang glared at me and followed me out.</p>
<p>At this time, disappointment replaced our excitement when we came. We walked in the cold wind and rain with our heads down, without saying a word.</p>
<p>There was a pastry shop by the road, with steamed buns and noodles. Steam was rising from the pot.</p>
<p>We felt a little empty in our stomachs and were afraid of getting our clothes wet, so we walked into the shop and went upstairs. The window upstairs faced the street. For some reason, I felt like this place was like an inn in a martial arts novel, and I myself seemed like a hero. I tapped the plate twice with my bamboo chopsticks, and a waiter ran up. We ordered some pastries and ate slowly, looking at the sky from time to time.</p>
<p>"Look," Ying said as if she had discovered something, "the raindrops aren't sparse anymore, the sky is clearing up, oh my god, we still have hope!" She jumped up happily.</p>
<p>Indeed, the rain had stopped. The sun gradually emerged from the clouds, the clouds scattered, letting out the sun, letting out the blue sky.</p>
<p>The clear weather and hot food dispelled our hunger, cold, and fatigue. We walked out of the shop and walked towards the beach, skipping and jumping.</p>
<p>A slightly curved, narrow, white road, obliquely hidden under the shade of trees on both sides, led to a not-so-high earthen slope. Walking up the earthen slope, you could see the surging white waves. The water here seemed even grander than at Paotai Bay, with no visible boundaries, only a faint line, a line separating the sky and the water. The sailboats in the distance and the cloud shadows on the horizon seemed not to move, slowly disappearing at the end of the sky and the water.</p>
<p>There was a row of stone slabs by the sea, as smooth as marble. We sat on the stone, and the warm sunlight happily enveloped the surroundings. I sighed softly and said to Ying, "Haven't you seen Tangyuan Xishi before? How beautiful is she?"</p>
<p>"I have seen her, but it was an evening, she was very busy, she put down the tangyuan and walked away. She never showed her smiling face, nor did she look at me. Although her graceful outline is still deeply imprinted in my mind, alas, I, with my nearsighted eyes, didn't see her face clearly at all."</p>
<p>Ying continued, "I have a fellow villager who studies at Zhongxiao, and I heard him say that that evening, the students at Zhongxiao took her to play in the dormitory, and many people made a lot of noise and had fun."</p>
<p>These words stirred up Xiang's usual easily triggered complaints. She cursed angrily,</p>
<p>"Damn society, damn men, they use all kinds of methods—seduction and oppression—to create women on the streets at night who are painted with powder and have red eyes, selling their bodies. They exploit her flesh and blood and then abandon her withered bones. Alas, this net of sin is raised high towards innocent girls—Tangyuan Xishi—waiting for her to fall down. Alas, educated, equality-advocating, intellectuals, what, ......"</p>
<p>As she spoke, she stretched out her waist and gently lay down on the stone slab, covering her eyes with her hands.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Chinese Harmonica Society Goes to the Capital <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>In recent years, many Chinese people have become interested in the harmonica. The harmonica is a very simple and inexpensive instrument, and learning to play it is not as difficult and time-consuming as other instruments—this is indeed a major reason why everyone is interested in the harmonica.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are many harmonica societies, and the most noteworthy and prestigious among them is of course the Chinese Harmonica Society. Under the guidance of harmonica expert Wang Qingxun, it has given public performances several times and has also broadcasted several times on the radio, allowing the national public to appreciate the art of the harmonica.</p>
<p>This time, the National Assembly, which the whole country longed for and which Premier Sun Yat-sen advocated, opened in the capital on May 5. The preparatory office and the authorities invited the Chinese Harmonica Society to perform in the capital for the appreciation of representatives from all provinces and cities across the country.</p>
<p>The departure date is May 1. The fare has been approved by the authorities and is free of charge. They will return in about ten days. There, one night, they will hold a concert at Jinling University. The ticket price is one yuan, eight jiao, and four jiao. The proceeds from the ticket sales will be used to supplement travel expenses and other purposes.</p>
