<p>路透社十二日倫敦電　財政大臣史諾登今日在下院答關於銀市之問題、謂責令政府維持無用存銀、使繼續產銀者受其利益、渠未見其合理云、保守黨議員建議財政大臣可向有關係政府接洽、以期限制現銀之出售、史諾登答稱、銀價低落、固爲幣銀之出售所助成、但其因則爲以金價計算的各種物價之跌落、其他原因爲中國政局之不寗、及銀礦出產之不見减少、僅限制售銀、不過暫時辦法、苟不採行更大計劃、銀價將無恒久起色之可能云、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>銀賤問題與英美之見解</h3>
<p>救濟銀賤問題。美委員之報告。謂必須謀英國。終止將印度現銀傾銷於世界市塲之政策。是其意蓋謂。銀價之賤。由於英國售銀所致也。但今日英國財長史諾登對於英議會之答詞。則謂責令英國政府。維持無用存銀。使繼續產銀者受其利益。渠未見其爲合理。是其意蓋謂世界銀賤之由來。實爲美國產銀過多不加限制之故。英國即停止售銀。銀價亦必以生產過多需用過少。而日即下賤。是其責在於產銀之國。而不在於售銀之國也。英美二者之間各以所處之地位。而謀自全故欲望各國之能自犧牲。以救銀價之不下落。此不可能之事也。</p>
<p>史諾登氏又謂銀價之下落。不僅由於銀幣之出售。亦由於以金價計算各種物價之跌落。其意蓋謂銀不用爲幣。亦屬貨物之一。故其價亦落。其言亦非無理。故有以銀爲副幣。并定金與銀之比例之說。亦有提倡之者。即此故也。但余所觀。售銀與產銀之國。現方各謀自利。雖有種種救濟銀賤之策。恐一無能行也。</p>

<p>敎師丨你們該相親相愛。有如自己的弟兄一樣。而我所處的地位。就是你們的父親。</p>
<p>一學生丨父親。我要一塊錢。買朱古律糖去。</p>
<p>汽車推銷員丨先生。這一輛汽車。又漂亮。又堅固。你買了决不會懊悔。</p>
<p>少年丨你且給我試一下子再說。我的未婚妻也會開車。非呌伊試試不可。我看這駕駛機與制動機裝置得不合式。伊開時一定覺得不便。</p>

<h3>吳佩孚瑣事</h3>
<p>何·磷·</p>
<p>客有自川中來者。述吳佩孚瑣事。頗有風趣。因一一記之。前者誤傳子玉秀才病危。今知不確。至其誤傳之緣由。亦見於下</p>
<p>楊森對吳稱詩弟子　吳在蜀。旣託庇於楊森。楊森略通文翰。自前年起。亦喜爲詩。偶以寄呈於吳。吳爲删改寄還之。且獎以數語。於是楊森奉書於吳。常自稱詩弟子。吳亦喜爲人道焉。並謂假使楊森抛却軍事。専學爲詩。當爲我入室弟子。</p>
<p>書畫廣傳川中　吳於來索書畫者。輒應之。屬門上不許留難。從前但畫竹。近又兼能寫蘭。所題畫。皆自爲詩句。爲人作書。初皆行草。今又兼作分隷。大有應接不睱之勢焉。</p>
<p>倩人刻圖章百餘方　蜀士有金雲鶴者。工刻石。吳一見盛贊之。謂此君鐵筆。得鄧石如遺意。因邀與相見。請其鐫刻圖章。聞一二年中。共爲吳刻百餘方。除刻昔人詩句。及自爲詩句外。大抵皆入川後自稱之名號。如失敗英雄。酸秀才。老酸。醉臥沙場客。戎馬書生。投戈老卒。學圃散人。凡若此者。不可徧舉。大抵皆含有不平意氣。其寫蘭。則常用板橋句。打破烏盆更入山七字一印。見者謂恰合地位云。</p>
<p>近又自稱四不老人　吳於秋間曾病。臥床半月餘。嘗口占自挽詩數首。及自挽聯語。外間誤傳病危者。殆由於此。述者但記其聯語云。得意時。清白乃心。不納妾。不積金錢。飲酒賦詩。猶是書生本色。失敗後倔彊到底。不出洋。不走租界。灌園抱　。眞個解甲歸田。門客言上下聯俱用不字。似複。吳笑曰。這又非前清考試場中。重複何害。因自稱四不老人云。又聞自挽詩。有沙蟲百萬鐵騎三千等語。工於對仗。氣亦壯旺。故知其不即死也。</p>
<h3>志瘋犬之狂噬</h3>
<p>清</p>
<p>吾邑（嘉定）日前（於數）城市有狂犬囓人之發現。時在晨間八時左右。適市心行人衆多之際。故被其噬者。雖欲避而不得。因是瘋犬肇禍。較之往日而尤烈。特此次始得博地方當軸者之注意。是不可以不記。亦所以望補救於將來。得免此无妄之災。而不至重罹斯毒爾。</p>
<p>嗣是日之瘋犬。來自東門外之枯草灣。距城僅五六里許。爲某姓家所豢。犬身不甚大。作黃白花色。實一尋常之玩犬耳。不知何以忽作喪家之狀。直奔至東門左近。逕過春橋。向東南以進斜涇。折回復入城内。初至邑廟旁啓良學校。幾受其創。經由校中通電話至縣公安局。促其有所防衛。詎是犬已至東城橋西。而狂噬數人矣。其受創最重者。爲一叫賣草鞋某之鄕人。兩足膝灣。俱流血不止。涔涔下墮及地。而不得不負痛以去。蓋其時道旁警士。不以爲意。竟置之不顧也。不意是犬過州橋以西。又折而南。復經普通學校。又囓甫欲進校之女生李某。幸未受傷。因手中適以書本爲抵禦。故是物被其所毀而已。最奇者隣近有嚴姓者之女。居西門外夫家某姓。是晨適自家出。遽逢斯犬。因是犬無人捕捉。故任其狂奔以出城。而該女乃會逢其適。遂被其趨而狂噬。欲以手抗。至掌背虎口。爲其爪牙所侵入。其受毒恐與某鄕人等。或且較深焉。計是犬於是晨共囓三十餘人。不能詳其姓氏。後至暉吉醬園西录家村。始被人以梃擊斃。而送至城市塔前存仁醫院檢騐其毒之有無云。</p>
<p>吾邑前南里張鴻年家。豢一小犬。狀若獅。而嬉戲令人鍾愛。聞得自滬上高姓者。乃於去歲十一月中。其弟媳竟爲所噬。未幾。遂以不救。舉家同受其毒者。雖幸得免。而醫治服藥。所費不貲。有建議取締豢犬者。當軸置若罔聞。及此次始由城市第一區區公所區長顧旭初動議。凡有犬者。須用嘴套。否則即由公安局負責捕捉。并向滬上購得治瘋犬咬藥水多種。飭市警調查曾被囓者。速來醫院打針救治外。復鳴鑵告誡市民以防不虞。洵地方不容緩之急務也。故余樂志之。</p>
<h3>豢狗須知</h3>
<p>秋·水·</p>
<p>西洋婦女喜狗。幾成風尙。自歐風東漸。在街頭巷尾。亦輒見吾國士女。携狗與俱。則狗之得人類普遍之愛戴。槪可知矣。因西洋愛狗者之多。豢狗之術遂成爲一種専門之學術。紐約與倫敦有所設貓狗理髮館之外。更有貓狗之専門鹥院。各種雜志上。更常見有各種關於豢狗常識之刋載。爰擇其要者。譯而出之。以供同好。</p>
<p>（一）每日清晨。驅之出戶外。使之稍得新鮮空氣外。且可使其儘量排洩汚物。久之成習。室内即不致遺穢。有礙衛生。</p>
<p>（二）狗宜常洗。以除汚穢。且以預防疾病。然洗滌之後必須以乾毛由拭之使乾。更以梳梳之。否則易於感冒或罹肺疾。</p>
<p>（三）冬季爲各種動物之危險時期。狗亦難逃此例。豢狗者日間宜披之以衣。夜間與以溫暖之狗床。床宜常保清潔。不時拂拭。以免害蟲之滋長。</p>
<p>（四）狗身不潔。易生虱類。自幼以藥水皂或小狗皂（藥房中有售）洗之可免。</p>
<p>（五）狗血不潔。易致癩毛。此時除用藥水常洗外。更宜速行就醫。否則癩毛傳染人體。爲害非小。</p>
<p>（六）狗食宜精不宜多。牛肉爲唯一良品。惟不宜多食。且不宜雜入鹹汁。</p>
<p>（七）狗忌食鹹物及火腿骨之類。否則將發生異臭。</p>
<p>（八）狗頸不宜常繫以帶。</p>
<p>（九）對狗須思威並用。</p>
<p>（十）狗鼻常濕。乾者必病。宜速治之。</p>
<p>（十一）雌狗交尾期間。宜以同種類之雄者與之。否則易致難產。</p>
<p>（十二）長毛之狗。夏日宜剪去其毛。則狗身凉爽。秋後毛生長。更見光澤。</p>
<h3>南洋游記</h3>
<p>（一一九）靈·花·</p>
<p>有可注意者。印度之下級社會生活習慣及其思想是也。此等爲黑色人種。即稱加拉人者也。中國人畢竟有自負習慣。對於各色人均輕視之。而加混　號。如呼西洋人爲紅毛鬼。緬人爲老緬。黑人爲黑鬼。黑人生活最可憐。而爲南洋各各地勞工之大社會。余在新加坡即甚憐其生活。曾略記之。記得一次余住新山寺。將入門。而門不開余手執各物。不得自開門。有加拉人過彼。恭敬爲我開門。心甚喜之。及至緬甸。黑人更多。且菘人頗有禮節。極小心事奉。遇人即拉車就之。與以錢。接必雙手。且表敬意。若從人前走過。必傴身曲躬。（緬女人亦然）華人對之亦不佳。例如與車錢。彼若爭。即以杖打之。彼即逃去。而緬女人亦每有命其曳車而不給錢之事。此等人夜多臥於人　卜。日用右可十數銅元。　過去。然不但勞工而已。其性質極馴良而無怨色。余甚怪之。以視中國現在勞工界氣燄一日千里。有打倒資本及智識階級之勢。而若廣東客棧之茶房。不受呼喚。并不招待客人。尤可怪也。及問之人。知印度情形者。乃知印度加拉工人如此苦而不怨由印度宗敎致之也。印度敎傳說人類初生。由某神體分出第一等人。從神首生出。其後爲僧侶。故最貴。次等人由臂生出。次貴。故爲帝王。又次等人由腹下出。故爲商家。最下等人由下部生出。故執勞工。此印度階級制度由神話造成也。此敎至今不衰。故勞工者。旁而無怨。願其出自族姓之微賤而已。佛經屢言旃佗羅種行路不敢當人前。惟恐人觸之。故手振　錫杖。以便避貴人。僧侶出家亦應謙下。學其「振錫」振錫二字之來源也。至今加拉工人如此安身立命而不悔。吾甚歎神敎人人之深而難變。而以佛平等之化數千年。不能改之。且佛敎全失敗。由此觀之。政治爲不可少矣。物極必反。印度加拉人之多。將來一遇俄國勞工之敎導運動。由臯賤而變爲神聖。恐有昂頭世界之一日。未可輕視也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨</h3>

<p>那個外國人。。給花元春帶好了手表。。又端相了一回。。攙攙伊的手。。拍拍伊的肩頭。。便和那個客人嘰哩咕嚕的說了一陣。。花老六輕輕的向那客人說道。。那個接眚外國人。。說點我　呀。。那客人道。。他稱贊你好。。你倒要駡他。。他說你的的臂很白。。帶了那隻手表。。愈加顯出潔白了。。倘然是瘦的手腕上。。便没有那樣好看。。因爲你的手又白又膩。。所以分外覺得相稱。。無論中外男女。。高帽子總戴得上的米湯總灌得進的。。花老六聽得外國人也贊伊好。。當然願意。。也和這位外國人笑臉相迎。。客人道。。那末就是這這一隻了。。花元春點了一點頭。。說不知道多少價錢。。客人道。。你别管。。反正是我送給你的。。又和那個外國人咕嚕了一下子。。他便從身邊　出一本小簿子。。用扣在洋裝馬甲口袋上的一支自來水筆。。簽了一張單子給外國人。。外國人向他們兩人鞠了一鞠躬。。便把這手表。。裝在一隻紫皮壳子。。裏面用藍緞子堆起的匣子裏。。交付於花老六。。花老六也没有知道到底那個手表是多少錢。。伊不識外國字。。也不知道那客人所簽的支單是多少錢。。直到了兩人坐在馬車裏。。花元春又問客客人是多少錢。。客人道。。小意思。。四百五十塊錢。。本來要五百塊錢。。因爲那個外國人。。我有點認得。。從前也作成他過生意。。所以打了一個九折。。花元春自然很高興。。那時女界中剛剛流行手表。。而且伊是一隻鑲鑽的白金手表。。出堂唱。。看戲。。在許多燈光之下。。閃閃有光。。有許多不大見世面的小姊妹淘裏。。看見了問道。。六阿姐。。你怎麽買了一隻銀手表。。花元春傲然的笑了一笑道。。這隻手表呌名頭算是白金的咧。。有個小姊妹道。。。。阿呀。。白金還比黃金貴嗎。。花老六道。。聽說要貴二十倍。。人家問伊多少錢買的。。伊就加上一點虚價。。七百塊八百塊的亂說。。人家也便將信將疑。。後來那個客人回南洋去了。。花老六爲紀念那個客人起見。。倒還是帶在手上。。有一天。。不知息麽樣。。那手表上周圍所鑲的小鑽。。脫去了一粒。。也是那個小阿寳。。人雖小。。眼睛非常尖利。。在牀面前瞧見亮晶晶一粒東西。。你看是你戒指上的嗎。。花元春一看。。戒指上並不缺少。。再看手表上。。却留下一個小小的空隙。。</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>顧·昂·若·譯·</p>
<p>九月四日、我的支隊分派着整個軍隊應得的軍需等等、因此脫離了第四軍而自立、正式編成爲第九軍、後來又得着八月二十日以後暫時留在魯倫的步兵第十八師（第九軍團）的增援、······</p>
<p>第九軍的工作（九月九日）很是明瞭、無論如何困難、只支軍隊務須在前綫支持着戰鬬力、阴止敵人衝破防線、並且要使他們不能越雷池一步、直到勝利確定了之後、我因此一再鼓勵士卒作殊死戰、並且拿戰線的其餘各段的敵人的狀况告訴他們、使他們曉得我對於我們最後勝利的堅决的信任心、</p>
<p>據第九軍司令部所得着的報告、德軍自開戰以來、行軍迄未停止、他們的堅忍力已用到極點、許多隊伍早已没有了軍官和下士了、各團進行混亂不堪、一般的軍官已失了控制、</p>
<p>「敵人深信我們不能再事抵抗、我們勇猛的襲擊定使敵人措手不及、</p>
<p>「利用這個時機的關係重大難於盡述、我惟望你們個個買其餘勇作最後之一擊、我們的民族到了危急存亡的時候不會缺乏此最後之敵力的、</p>
<p>「敵人隊伍裏的混亂是我們勝利的先聲、</p>
<p>「假使你們今天能夠一鼓作氣的遏制他們、明天我們就可以驅逐他們離開我們的國境、</p>
<p>「記着勝利歸於支持最久的、法國的勞譽和全力尙在未定之天、努力努力你們可操勝劵、</p>
<p>「全線的報告都很良好、······」</p>
<p>最生要的是第四十二師的右翼有有力的後援、現在第十一軍團似乎佈置協助該師作戰、魏根土校在五點鐘就直接向林塞爾的第二十一師下令、</p>
<p>第四十二師五時十五分從林塞弗羅線進攻康腦脫康腦脫粉廠（高雷之北、）</p>
<p>第十一軍團已奉令在其全線進擊、協助該師前進的右翼、</p>
<p>第二十一師立即向歐未西北的山脊進攻、</p>
<p>至於我自己呢、我向兵士作最後的激勵、呌他們用全副精力放入這次的進攻、於是我們就在九月九日的晚上、自西至東開始向阜爾香本諾亞及其要首大反攻、</p>
<p>我們的士卒眞是將近精疲力盡了、但是現在呢、再度進攻、我們顯出我們取勝的决心、並且計算第四十二師用全力出擊的時候、我們對於前數日、猛力攻擊後精疲力竭的敵人確有操左劵的機會、况且敵人初期的勝利使他們南進如此敏疾、他們的地位反因之頗不穩固、······</p>
<p>阜爾香諾一帶的地方及其各路沿路死傷狼籍、可以證明敵人確已受了重創、被擒的俘虜爲數甚巨、勝利品源源不絕的解到、敵人倉皇的退却已顯露着端倪了、</p>
<p>九月九日聯軍的反政正在進行、十日德軍開始退却、到了十一日已由退却而奔潰了、福煦的第九軍的前進絕無阻碍、十二日居然攻過芒河、　　那天、福煦將當日的命令加上這句「計劃没有變更、各地進攻中、各地挺追中、」</p>
<p>芒河之戰快要結束、那確是一大勝仗、那是霞飛總司令的功勞、他對於這次大戰在八月二十四日就開始策劃、並且</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>指揮戰事直至終了、我們在邊境上受了挫折之後、他立即明白的看出這仗打得很　、所以他罷了戰、準備待他補充了已經發覺的弱點、再接再厲的重新作戰、他在比利時施用了有力的戰略、完全洞悉了敵人的目標、他絕不揂豫的重新佈置了他的軍隊、並且因爲有些軍官有不能勝任的證據、他重新分配了全部的軍官、他在西面佈置好了疑陣、就繼續退却、直到適當的時機、他命令他的軍隊停止退却、軍隊向後轉之後、他聰明的並用了攻勢戰與守勢戰、再軍用有計劃的動作、給敵人一個致命傷、</p>
<p>從沃爾克直到魯倫、全體軍隊、完全明折這次大戰、如再慘敗法國决不能幸存、所以十分團結十分出力的接戰、高級司令和他們的參謀、個個互相互相競爭實行他們的任務、並且以最好的友愛精神互相帮助、兵卒打得力竭聲嘶、跌倒戰塲、立起來再戰、並且戰得更利害、</p>
<p>這次戰爭更加證明戰時的軍隊的精神是國家最深刻的情操的反射、這些潛勢力遇着了能幹的總司令好好的指導着、歷史上的大事業就此建立、這就是芒河大戰的意義、</p>
<p>巴黎、法國的心、現在爲她的直接的保護人所參加的勝仗拯救了、他們的軍事當局派遣他們上戰塲、因爲法京的存亡在此一舉、</p>
<p>德軍的計劃失敗了、德軍的威信也掃地以盡、敏疾的猛烈的進攻、满望使法國一蹶不振、現在不但停止、且被擊退、一部分而且潰敗了、</p>
<p>在這狀况之下、要咞究的就是敵人以後怎樣重新佈置他們的隊伍、在西綫作戰將採用何種新計劃、在這時期丨這是我們最關心的問題丨東綫大隊的俄軍是否能克敵致勝、德奧同盟軍是否能支持兩面的戰局、從前他們集中一綫已告失敗了、</p>
<p>八月廿八日、我帶領第九軍的時候、司令部的官報載着、「從孔姆到伏斯奇···進攻勝利」、七月十日的官報載着、「法軍勝利證實···」、我們軍隊的轉敗爲勝、我不無關係、甚是愉快、</p>
<p>攻擊第九軍希望衝破法軍中央陣綫的德軍兵力如下、</p>
<p>德國第二軍丨丨第十軍團（兼攻法國第十軍團）第十後備軍團和警備軍團、</p>
<p>德國第三軍丨丨第十三軍團（第三十二及二十三師）和第十二後備軍團（第二十三及二十四後備師）、</p>
<p>正在歇龍地方肅清殘敵的時候、我接着不幸的消息、就是我的家屬自八月廿二日起在前綫遭殃了、這消息是第三軍司令薩拉義帶給我的、我當時因爲迫切的國事覊着、無睱哀悼、不過我當時覺得倘使這些自願的犧牲不是無爲的、那末已經獲得的勝利必定是方興未艾、</p>
<p>在歇龍的時候有當地的許多權要求看我、第一個是芒縣知事歇坡龍君、我爲了佔用分的地方對他道歉、並且使他希望我們只須短時期的佔用、其實司令部的駐紮該處尙有好幾月、繼歇坡龍君而來的是歇龍的敎鐵西謁君、他在德軍進攻的時候、並没有離開他的敎堂、他正在詳述敵人佔領的短時期内的事情、怎樣親自請求塞克遜皇太子、該鎭因得免除艱重的捐欵、此時該區的參議員白其亞君和衆議員孟笏君與貝香持博士亦聯袂而至、我們因之一致祝賀我們親愛的法國的偉大和力量、她的健兒完全忘却了政黨的衝突、協力同心的擊退了敵人、</p>
<p>十月四日之後、第九軍前綫的戰事轉入停滯的時期、並且停滯了很久、敵人藉其有力的砲隊鞏固了優勢的地位、更築成了幾道連續的深壕、有機關槍保護着、兩翼架起隱匿着的大砲、這不是驅逐敵人的時機、九月廿六日、敵人的總攻也是完全夫敗、我們的防守一天一天的隱固、敵人什樣的來攻我們是無須擔憂、在這樣狀况之下、香本一帶目前是没有决定勝負的希望、</p>
<p>至於前方的其餘防綫、尤其是我們的軍隊所搆成的左翼、有何事情發生、我不過從每天的官報上模糊的曉得一點、在這茫狀的狀態、我就在十月四日下午接着總司令的通知、呌我到羅密樓地方他的總司令部去、我在下午四時左右在那裏報到、</p>
<p>霞飛將軍告訴我、聯軍左翼向來的作戰的目標是包圍德軍的右翼、倘使這計劃不能成功、我們的戰略可使敵人不致有同樣的動作包圍我們的左翼、根據這個目標、他已經調遣克斯德爾拿將軍的第二軍（司令部在白勒塔義）到沃義斯和沙姆北面第六軍的左方、瑪寳將軍的支隊（司令部在聖包羅）爲着同樣的使命正奉令同亞拉斯前進、該支隊曾經常加補充、並且常令單獨作戰、十月五日該支隊編成爲第十軍、</p>
<p>擔任第二第十兩軍的聯絡的是白魯奇將軍的義勇隊（司令部在杜朗）、</p>
<p>英國軍隊亦請求從愛義斯調遣到我們的左翼、這個請求已經准可、調遣不久就要實行、英軍司令部則設在聖亞美爾、最後、結集安特渥鄰近的比利士軍隊、遲早也要設法合作、因爲這一帶的幾個司令官有點猶豫、並且希望同我們的聯軍得着满意的妥協、總司令决定命我以總司令助理的名義立刻到北綫去指揮、協助聯軍作戰、</p>

<h3>Situation in Spain Deteriorates Daily</h3>
<p>Restoration of Constitutional Government Repeatedly Delayed</p>
<p>Popular Support Lost, Imperial System Difficult to Maintain</p>
<p>Outbreak in Cadiz Declares General Strike</p>
<p>Land and Water Transportation Completely Stopped</p>
<p>Madrid, National News Agency, 12th. A general strike has been declared in the town of Cadiz, and several major clashes have occurred. Traffic, shipping, and other industries have completely ceased. The situation in Spain is becoming increasingly serious. Hopes for a peaceful election have sharply decreased. A conference to commemorate the First Republic, convened by republican organizations, is scheduled to be held on Sunday. Even if the authorities prohibit it beforehand, it will likely exacerbate the crisis. In short, to trace the root cause of the disaster, although the overthrow of the Spanish dictatorship government was unavoidable, if the holders of the country's power could immediately restore the rights granted by the constitution after the overthrow and implement solutions to appease the hopes of the whole country, they could still salvage the lost public support. But they did not do so and delayed until now, causing the situation to tend toward an extremely serious path. In the future, whether the imperial system can be maintained is doubtful.</p>
<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Opposes Restricting Silver Sales</h3>
<p>World Silver Production Shows No Decrease</p>
<p>No Possibility of Improvement in Silver Prices</p>
<p>House of Commons Passes Liberal Party Motion</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 12th. Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden stated in the House of Commons today, in response to questions about the silver market, that he did not see it as reasonable to order the government to maintain useless silver reserves so that continued silver producers could benefit. Conservative Party members suggested that the Chancellor of the Exchequer could contact the governments concerned to restrict the sale of silver. Snowden replied that the fall in silver prices was indeed facilitated by the sale of silver coins, but the reason was the fall in the prices of various commodities calculated in gold, other reasons being the instability of the political situation in China and the lack of reduction in silver mine production. Merely restricting the sale of silver is only a temporary measure. If a larger plan is not adopted, there is no possibility of a permanent improvement in silver prices.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 12th. This afternoon, a member of the House of Commons asked whether Craig, the governor of the South African Reserve Bank, had accepted the British government's request to go to Shanghai to investigate the fall in silver prices. Undersecretary of State for the Colonies Hills replied that this question almost refers to the proposal to send a committee to Hong Kong to investigate the currency system there. The composition of this committee is something he is currently unable to say.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 12th. The comments made by Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden in the House of Commons last night were admired by both the Conservative and Liberal parties for their courage, but members of the Labor Party speculated about Snowden's so-called sacrifice, as they do not know where the sacrifice is. Members of the Labor Party have now expressed their determination not to recognize any method of transferring unemployment funds from the Treasury elsewhere. The Ministry of Labor issued a memorandum advocating the introduction of a bill to increase the borrowing capacity of the basic unemployment fund from £70 million to £90 million, and stated that on December 19, the borrowing capacity of the basic unemployment fund had increased to £70 million, but its debt had increased from £59 million to £66 million, with an average weekly increase of £1 million. At the same time, the Department of Commerce's January report showed a large decrease in imports and exports, which was due to the continued disputes in the cloth and coal industries. Imports last month were £75,569,000, a decrease of £14,060,000 compared to December of last year, and exports were £37,563,000, a decrease of £894,000 compared to December of last year.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 12th. The House of Commons passed a motion by the Liberal Party advocating the large-scale adoption of beneficial and necessary national development plans to reduce unemployment. Prime Minister MacDonald said that the greatest wisdom at present is to develop the nation's resources and seek capital for the development of the nation's resources.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Silver Price Problem and the Views of Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of rescuing the low silver prices, the report of the American committee stated that Britain must be persuaded to terminate the policy of dumping Indian silver on the world market. Their meaning is that the low silver price is due to Britain's sale of silver. However, today British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden's reply to the British Parliament stated that he did not see it as reasonable to order the British government to maintain useless silver reserves so that continuous silver producers could benefit. Their meaning is that the world's low silver prices are due to the United States' overproduction of silver without restrictions. Even if Britain stops selling silver, the silver price will inevitably decline due to overproduction and insufficient demand. The responsibility lies with the silver-producing countries, not the silver-selling countries. Britain and the United States are each seeking their own interests based on their respective positions and hope that other countries can sacrifice themselves to prevent the silver price from falling. This is an impossible thing.</p>
<p>Mr. Snowden also stated that the fall in silver prices is not only due to the sale of silver coins, but also due to the fall in the prices of various commodities calculated in gold. His meaning is that silver, when not used as currency, is also a commodity, so its price also falls. His words are not unreasonable, hence the existence of the theory of using silver as subsidiary currency and setting a ratio between gold and silver. There are also those who advocate this, which is the reason. However, in my opinion, the silver-selling and silver-producing countries are currently each seeking their own interests. Although there are various strategies for rescuing the low silver prices, I fear that none will be effective.</p>

<h3>German Communist Party Members Propose Stopping Payment of Reparations</h3>
<p>The Parliament Voted Down the Proposal with a Majority</p>
<p>The Young Plan Needs to Be Modified</p>
<p>Who Was the Aggressor in the European War Awaits Investigation</p>
<p>Berlin, National News Agency, 12th. The discussion of the budget bill in the German Parliament is progressing smoothly. The atmosphere in the entire venue is unusually peaceful because the opposition party only has the Communist Party faction left. Although they want to disrupt, they are always contained by the government party. National Party member Katdorf was elected as the vice president, replacing the vacancy left by National Socialist Party member Store.</p>
<p>Berlin, Reuters, 12th. The Young Plan for reparations and the causes of the World War were both issues discussed in Parliament today. Later, a motion stating that the government should quickly handle the issue of modifying the Young Plan was passed by 314 votes to 56. The Communist Party proposed a motion stating that Germany should stop paying various reparations, but this motion was voted down by 314 votes to 58. Parliament then passed a proposal requesting that an impartial committee investigate the causes of the World War.</p>
<h3>Third Phase of Japanese Political Warfare to Begin</h3>
<p>Opposition Parties to Launch Full-Scale Attack on Government in Budget Subcommittee</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Jiji Press) – The debate between the ruling and opposition parties in Japan is now entering its third phase. The government is reorganizing its ranks to prepare for the opposition parties’ fierce counterattack and is also devising comprehensive strategies for the Upper House.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Dentsu) – The House of Representatives Budget Committee will move into the subcommittee stage today. The opposition parties, having gained much ammunition and strong verbal evidence through questioning in the Budget General Committee, are confident of a considerable harvest and plan to launch a final, all-out attack in the subcommittees. Their plan is to focus on the Acting Prime Minister issue and the Wushe Incident in the First Subcommittee, unemployment countermeasures in the Second Subcommittee, overestimation of tax revenue and recession countermeasures in the Third Subcommittee, and supplementary project issues in the Fourth Subcommittee, attacking the government with all their might, section by section. Therefore, while the Fifth and Sixth Subcommittees may be relatively quiet, the debates in the other subcommittees are bound to be intense.</p>
<h3>Questions in the Upper House Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Dentsu) – Today’s Upper House plenary session convened at 10:00 AM, immediately changing the agenda to include the tax reduction and postponement bill for earthquake victims. The Speaker appointed committee members to the bill. Questioning from the previous day continued, with Inoue of the Koseikai taking the podium to question Acting Prime Minister Shidehara, stating that Shidehara had used the phrase "relatively large country" regarding the arms reduction treaty, which was an insult to the Japanese people. It was outrageous that the Foreign Minister of Japan would treat his own country as a small nation. He spoke with great vehemence. He then addressed the issue of determining military strength, saying that regarding the determination of military strength, both the Minister of the Navy and the Chief of the Naval General Staff had stated that it was necessary to obtain their consent. Did the Acting Prime Minister share the same opinion? Acting Prime Minister Shidehara replied that he had not made such a statement regarding the first question, and he agreed with the Minister of the Navy on the second question. Next, Fujisawa, an independent, took the podium, stating that there was no other way to counter the recession than to promote academia. His speech was lengthy and retained the tone of a scholar. The session adjourned at 12:17 AM.</p>
<h3>Hamaguchi's Expected Return to Parliament</h3>
<p>Jiji Press – After being discharged from the hospital, Prime Minister Hamaguchi is recuperating at his official residence and his health is gradually improving.

<h3>Various Improvements in the Criminal Law Amendment</h3>
<p>Dentsu – The proposed amendments to the criminal law submitted by the Ministry of Justice to this parliamentary session contain many improvements, such as protecting the position of vulnerable women. In particular, the restoration of rights for those with criminal records is worthy of special mention. To date, approximately 1.5 million people have been executed or exempted from further service after being convicted of various crimes. The majority of these people with criminal records regret their past mistakes and seek to start new lives, continuing their struggles to make a living. However, a portion of society still regards them as former offenders and is unwilling to associate with them. Consequently, their attempts to return to legitimate professions are often thwarted. Therefore, a provision for restoring the rights of those with criminal records has been specifically established to provide relief, stating that "Three years after the completion of their sentences, those deemed to pose no risk of re-offending will, in principle, be granted the restoration of their rights." Once this provision is implemented, the 1.5 million people with criminal records who have been ostracized by society will greatly benefit.</p>

<h3>Procedures for the Control Yuan to Impeach Officials</h3>
<p>Control Commissioners’ Offices to Be Established in Each Region</p>
<p>People Filing Complaints Must Provide Guarantors</p>
<p>Impeachments by Control Commissioners Must Be Reviewed</p>
<p>The list of members of the Control Yuan has been approved by the Central Political Council and publicly announced by the State Council. The following is an exploration of the procedures for various facilities and accusations and impeachments after the establishment of the Yuan.</p>
<p>The country is divided into several regions. After the establishment of the Control Yuan, following the example of the imperial censors of the Qing Dynasty, the country will be divided into several regions, not necessarily based on provinces as the unit. The standard should be based on the prosperity of each province, either with one province as one region or two or three provinces combined into one region. Each region will have a Control Commissioner, appointed by the National Government upon the recommendation of the Yuan President. Control Commissioners may also serve concurrently as members of the Control Yuan. Each region will establish a Control Commissioner's Office. Although the Commissioner's Office will be their base of operations, they must periodically tour the region. The detailed draft of the above has been drafted by a committee established by the Yuan. After all members have taken office, further detailed discussions will be held, and then it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and promulgated by the National Government.</p>
<p>Investigation is paramount for impeaching officials. The duties of the Control Yuan are, firstly, to initiate impeachments by the Control Commissioners and, secondly, to receive complaints from the people to the Control Yuan. The detailed procedures are still being drafted. The content is that people who accuse officials must have two or more reputable business guarantors. The reasons for the accusation must state the facts in detail. After the complaint is submitted, the President of the Yuan will review it and designate three Control Commissioners to conduct a joint review. The responsibility of the review is to investigate the evidence on the ground. If the results are deemed conclusive, an impeachment will be filed at the General Assembly. After being approved by the General Assembly, the Yuan will submit it to the Committee on Disciplinary Sanctions for Officials for execution. If the Control Commissioners initiate the impeachment on their own, that is, the Control Commissioners investigate officials and believe they should be impeached, they will list the evidence, or have three Control Commissioners jointly sign the proposal, and submit it to the President of the Yuan. The President of the Yuan will then send it to another three Control Commissioners for joint review. The subsequent procedures are the same as above.</p>
<p>People's Accusations Are Absolutely Confidential. Regardless of whether the charges against the accused officials are proven, the Control Yuan will not issue any instructions to the accusers and will maintain absolute confidentiality. In other words, the accusers are directly responsible to the Control Yuan. When the Control Yuan accepts the complaint and initiates an impeachment, the impeaching Control Commissioners are directly responsible to the accused, while the accusers and the accused never have a direct relationship.</p>
<p>Five Measures to Punish Officials. When the Committee on Disciplinary Sanctions for Officials accepts the Control Yuan's charges against officials, the Committee will discuss and determine, according to the law, the punishment the accused should receive, which is divided into (1) dismissal, (2) demotion, (3) salary reduction, (4) demerit, and (5) warning. When the Committee on Disciplinary Sanctions for Officials determines the charges, it will send them for execution. Except for specially appointed officials who are sent to the National Government for execution, the rest will be sent to the responsible superiors for execution within a specified period. If the accused has committed bribery and should be subject to criminal penalties, the Committee will send them to the court for execution according to legal procedures.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong's Troops Stop Entering Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Ordered by the Central Government to Temporarily Postpone Departure</p>
<p>Prepared Troop Trains Have Been Returned</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The 26th Route Army of Sun Lianzhong was ordered to enter Jiangxi, and repeated announcements were made about their departure, but it has not happened yet. On the 11th, a telegram from Jining was received here, stating that it was widely rumored in Jining that Sun's army had stopped its departure and would not enter Jiangxi for the time being. However, as there was no concrete evidence and Sun's army was quite busy preparing for departure, and issued a mobilization order on the 9th to depart on the 10th, the claim that the departure had been stopped was initially difficult to believe. However, at noon on the 10th, according to news from the 26th Route Army Headquarters, it was learned that the unit had received a telegram from the Central Government on the evening of the 10th, approving the temporary postponement of departure and the cessation of entry into Jiangxi. Therefore, the empty trains parked at Jining Station of the Jinpu Railway, intended for transporting Sun's army, were also ordered by the Railway Bureau to be completely returned starting on the 11th. According to news from the Jinan transportation sector, the Jinan Vehicle Section of the Jinpu Railway Administration received a telegram from the Vehicle Department of the General Bureau, ordering that all empty trains transporting Sun's army be returned to the southern section. The Jinan Section has telegraphed Jining Station to comply. It is reported that they were returned separately in the afternoon of the 11th, leaving only one train in Jinan to be used for loading goods and then heading south, to avoid running empty. (11th)</p>
<h3>Perilous Situation of Ice Flooding in the Yellow River</h3>
<p>Downstream Situation is Particularly Dangerous</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The ice flooding of the Yellow River in this province, due to the sudden changes in temperature, with the river ice either freezing or melting, has caused dangerous conditions, as reported in previous correspondence. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, inspected Wang Wangzhuang in the Putai area on the 11th. The water level downstream was eight zhang and two chi above sea level, three chi higher than the major flood last year. The current water level situation has no fixed standard, because the river freezes from the sea mouth and extends upstream for two hundred li, and in the middle of this section, it is still either frozen or melted. The melted areas have accumulated ice, causing high water levels. Normally, Luokou is used as the standard, but now Luokou has lost its standard. The water level downstream is eight zhang and two chi, so the level at Luokou must be even higher. If the level at Luokou reaches nine zhang and six chi, it will reach the danger line. Although the level at Luokou has not yet reached this number, it has indeed reached a dangerous level as measured downstream. However, the dangerous areas are likely to be in the downstream area. The following is a true telegram sent by Zhang Lianjia from Putai to show the danger: Telegram from Zhang Lianjia to Han Jun, Chairman of the Provincial Government: Assuming you are aware of the Yiyou telegram. The water level at Tizi Dam dropped by one chi and two cun this morning, but the water level has risen in the area from Tuzaojia to Wang Wangzhuang downstream. The river is now full of ice floes and is freezing again. People crossing the river can now wade across the ice. With the continuous cold weather, it is unlikely to thaw soon. However, in the downstream section, which is about two hundred li long, the river water has risen out of the channel, ranging from two chi to five chi below the top of the dyke. If the ice thaws and the water level rises again, the situation will be dangerous everywhere and beyond imagination. The only plan for now is to order the villagers along both banks of the river to urgently repair the sections of the dyke that are lower than the water level, building two-chi-high subsidiary embankments as a preventive measure. In addition to ordering the concerned sections and notifying the counties of Lijin, Binxian, Putai, Qingcheng, Huimin, and Qidong, I urge you to order the above counties to take immediate action to strengthen the defenses. This would be a great act of benevolence. Zhang Lianjia respectfully Kouchong.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>Ping Correspondence: After the Central Government sent He Jingwu to Ping to take over the Pinghan Railway Bureau, it moved the bureau to Hankou, but still established an office in Ping. Recently, the Director of the office, Ge Li, discussed the situation of the northern section in detail, summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Restoring Train Service: Before the unification of railway administration, the ordinary trains on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway only ran to Xinxiang. The through train to Hankou was only the first and second express trains. Freight cars were even more difficult, and changing cars mid-way caused even greater losses for merchants. Now, after reorganization, the eleventh and twelfth trains operate between Beiping and Hankou, and the seventy-first and seventy-second trains between Beiping and Shijiazhuang, for a total of seven trains operating in both directions. The twenty-first and twenty-second trains between Beiping and Baoding are also operating on schedule. Currently, in the northern section north of Shunde, there are seventy locomotives, of which thirty-three are damaged. Approximately thirty locomotives are in operation on the line. There are approximately nine hundred passenger and freight cars, of which approximately one hundred and sixty are awaiting repair. Due to years of domestic warfare, the tracks are in disrepair. With the exception of the special express trains, there are often delays in train schedules. Plans are currently underway to restore service.</p>
<p>Goods on the Northern Section: The most revenue on the northern section of the line comes from coal, salt, and general merchandise. The revenue from each special express train is approximately ten thousand yuan, averaging approximately twenty thousand to thirty thousand yuan per day. However, the revenue of the Railway Bureau has peak months and slow months. This winter is expected to be a peak month, but due to insufficient vehicles, it will not be as high as in previous years. The annual revenue of the northern section is approximately ten million yuan. If there were enough locomotives, it could be increased to fifteen million yuan. The revenue of the southern section is mainly from tobacco leaves, grains, and cotton, in addition to imported foreign goods. If the tracks on the entire Pinghan Railway were repaired, the total revenue could be increased to over thirty-six million yuan.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Floods: In terms of track maintenance, there are sections of the line that have been in disrepair for many years. Temporary light railways are often used to facilitate operations, but they are not strong. If repairs are discussed, a large amount of funding is required. Bridges, in particular, should be given attention. Twenty short bridge tracks are stored in Hankou, and it is proposed to allocate a portion of them to be laid on the northern section. The northern section is mostly derived from the Taihang Mountains, and there is a risk of mountain floods every year. The northern section of the Pinghan Railway has three bridge maintenance sections, whose function is to protect the bridges. The northern bridge maintenance section was originally located on the north bank of the Yellow River and is proposed to be relocated to Zhengding, which is a more central location, making repairs and scheduling more convenient. Furthermore, flood control equipment and personnel are also being prepared. (10th)</p>
<h3>Banditry in Xinyu and Tonggu, Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Xinyu County Seat Captured Twice</p>
<p>Tonggu County Seat in Crisis</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Xinyu and Tonggu have long been ravaged by bandits. The people of these two counties have repeatedly requested troops for suppression, but there are not enough soldiers to allocate. Now that Minister He (Yingqin) has arrived in Jiangxi, the people of Xinyu in the provincial capital have again requested troops from Minister He. The petition describes the miserable conditions of the bandits' ravages, making it unbearable to read. The document states: "Submitted for the matter of petitioning. Xinyu is bounded by Xingan and Qingjiang to the east, Fenyi and Wanzai to the west, Ji'an, Jishui, and Anfu to the south, and Gao'an and Shanggao to the north. Most of the eastern, southern, and western corners of the county are deep mountains and dense forests. Once the bandits are defeated by our army, they flee into these areas. The people along the south bank of the river have been subjected to their rape, kidnapping, arson, and murder since 1928. The property lost is incalculable. In particular, the two captures of the county seat in 1930 were even more brutal. Apart from Ji'an, no county has suffered more than Xinyu. The county government has sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations. It is estimated that 2,564 civilians were brutally murdered, 5,831 were kidnapped, 37,736 fled, 360 firearms were confiscated, 4,771,100 yuan in property was looted, and 2,761 houses were burned. The fertile fields have been turned into scorched earth, and the people have become vengeful ghosts. The misery is so great that Zheng Xia's "Refugee Map" cannot adequately depict the situation. It is truly an unprecedented catastrophe. We have reported to the provincial government requesting relief and tax exemption, but the government has been unable to provide relief or exemption, resulting in depleted vitality. Now the banditry has returned. On January 28 of this year, more than 3,000 bandits who had been hiding in the southern villages suddenly ravaged the southern areas of the county with over 300 firearms and dozens of horses. Yao Weijun, Wanquan, Sixi, and other places have been occupied. The slaughter and burning are too horrible to bear. The county seat has a garrison battalion that is too busy collecting taxes and levies for the county government to have any spare capacity to suppress the bandits. Fortunately, you, Commander-in-Chief, have arrived in person and will surely be able to plan and win, clear out the bandits, and rescue the people from the depths of misery and lift them onto the cushion of safety. Therefore, we urge you, Commander-in-Chief, to quickly dispatch elite troops to encircle and suppress the evil bandits in Xinyu to alleviate the suffering of the people. The lives of the entire population are in urgent need of rescue."</p>

<p>Tonggu is located on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, and is frequently afflicted by banditry, including arson, murder, looting, and intolerable ravages. Previously, the county seat was captured by Liu's bandits, who looted and robbed extensively, causing incalculable losses. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 AM on January 24, a part of Huang's bandits, who had sneaked in from Paibu, captured the county seat again. The police and militia retreated to Sandu, fifteen li from the city, to gather. The People's Self-Defense Forces of the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Districts launched a counterattack in three directions at noon on the 27th, fighting desperately. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting for half a day, with bullets raining down, resulting in numerous bandit casualties and heavy casualties for the police. Later, due to the exhaustion of ammunition, they retreated to their original defenses to hold on and await reinforcements, and urgently telegraphed General Commander Chiang, Chairman Lu, and General Commander He for troops and assistance, expressing their grief and pain. In addition, the bandits in Chong Township of the county, armed for several days, contacted Huang's bandits, and on the 28th, they captured Sandu, Daxia, and Gujiaqiao, massacring thousands of civilians. Corpses were scattered everywhere, and the ground was covered in blood. Some corpses were burned with kerosene and cotton, while others were beheaded and dismembered, with livers and lungs cut out and cooked for consumption. Even Huang Chao and Li Zicheng were not this brutal. The bandits established a Soviet government in the county seat, carried out a "red purge" everywhere, and looted all the goods in the county's shops and the property of the people in the villages, moving them to places like Paibu and Pingtian. They also captured over a thousand men and demanded ransom within a specified period, and raped over seven hundred women day and night. Over three thousand people fled to Xiushui to escape, carrying the old and the young, with cries and wails filling the road. The Tonggu police launched several counterattacks, but they could not succeed due to the exhaustion of ammunition. Therefore, on the 30th, they retreated to Zhengcun in Xiushui to await reinforcements. This kind of catastrophe is truly unprecedented. (February 9)</p>
<h3>The Twists and Turns After the Special Tax on Hebei Was Implemented</h3>
<p>Tianjin Customs Refuses to Cooperate According to Regulations</p>
<p>The French Concession Forbids the Establishment of Offices</p>
<p>A dispatch from Ping: The special taxes on three commodities in Hebei, namely cotton yarn, cement, and matches, were implemented on the first of this month. Regarding the situation after the implementation, Wu Rongchun, the Chief of the First Section of the Hebei Special Commissioner's Office of Finance and concurrently the head of the Special Consumption Tax Administration, said that since the unified tax was implemented, less than ten days have passed. The goods stored in various firms are currently being inspected and transported, and not many new goods have been declared for taxation. Because the Hebei unified tax is in its initial stage, it is difficult to accurately estimate the amount of revenue. It is estimated that it can generate more than three million yuan per year. Recently, unexpected difficulties have arisen with the Tianjin Customs. Before the implementation of the unified tax, the Hebei Finance Office planned to establish resident offices at Tianjin Customs, Qinhuangdao, and other places to collect the unified tax according to regulations. There were no problems in Qinhuangdao, but unexpected issues arose in Tianjin. The personnel sent by the Finance Office to Tianjin Customs to establish offices and request the Customs to assist in tax collection according to regulations were refused by the Customs Commissioner, who claimed that he had not received instructions from the Shanghai General Customs Office. The Commissioner refused to allow the establishment of offices at the Customs and refused to assist in the inspection and taxation of goods. The personnel of the resident office had no choice but to rent houses near the Customs to set up offices for business. Unexpectedly, as soon as the preparations were completed, the French Concession's Municipal Council used the treaty as an excuse to prohibit the establishment of another tax collection agency within the concession and ordered the office personnel to move to a place near the Tianjin Customs in the Special Third District to temporarily carry out all activities. Currently, Tianjin Customs still refuses to cooperate on the grounds that it has not received orders, only notifying merchants to declare taxes at the office when goods arrive at the Customs, providing only passive assistance. As for inspection and other matters, they cannot be handled according to regulations. Under this circumstance, there are great drawbacks. Foreign goods imported cannot be inspected and taxed at the Customs and can be directly transported to the concession for sale. In this way, domestic goods are subject to the unified tax, while foreign goods can be evaded, which has a great impact on tax revenue and foreign trade. As a temporary remedy, additional personnel have been dispatched to patrol the border between the Chinese area and the concession day and night. Any goods transported from the concession without tax declaration will be immediately detained and severely punished to prevent evasion and provide assistance in case of emergency. Since this problem arose, the Finance Office immediately telegraphed Minister Song to report the situation, requesting him to order the Shanghai General Customs Commissioner to instruct the Tianjin Customs Commissioner to assist in establishing a resident office to implement tax collection, and requesting him to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French side, so that the Tianjin French Concession authorities would officially recognize or tacitly approve the establishment of a resident office within the concession. However, no reply has been received since the telegram was sent. Another telegram was sent the day before yesterday (7th), and no reply has been received today (9th). It is now planned to send another telegram to the Ministry of Finance to urge everything, and to send a telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang for instructions. The plan will be determined after receiving a reply.</p>
<h3>The Construction of the Shiqi Railway Is About to Begin</h3>
<p>The Only East-West Trunk Line in the North</p>
<p>The construction of the Cangshi Railway is of great importance to the transportation and commerce of northern China. During the era of the former Beijing government, the authorities frequently proposed its construction, but it was not realized due to repeated setbacks. Recently, Chinese industrialists Shen Changfu and others, believing that the construction of this railway is essential for the development of Chinese commerce, raised a large sum of money and organized a Shiqi Railway Company, submitting a request to the Ministry of Communications for its construction. It was approved by the Ministry of Communications in August of the 18th year of the Republic. According to their plan, after completing the section from Cangzhou to Shijiazhuang, it will be extended to Qikou Town, which is close to the Bohai Sea. The entire railway is planned to be 290 kilometers long and will be built in four sections. Each section will be opened to traffic upon completion. The first section is from Shijiazhuang to Donglu, 81 li long; the second section is from Shandonglu to Xianxian, 76 li long; the third section is from Xianxian to Cangxian, 67 li long; and the fourth section is from Cangxian to Qikou, 70 li long. There will be a total of 21 stations of various sizes. The important counties and districts it passes through are Zhaocheng, Zhaoxian, Jinxian, Jiucheng, Xinji, Donglu, Shenxian, Wuqiang, Raoyang, Jingxian, and Cangxian, connecting to the Bohai Sea. The area through which it passes is all plains, making it easy to build, and the land is fertile and the agricultural products are abundant, especially peanuts and cotton. After it is built, the export products of southern Hebei and the coal from Shanxi will no longer need to be transported around Tianjin and Qingdao, but can be directly exported from Qikou. According to experts, the terrain of Qikou is very good, and with a little dredging, it can be on par with Tianjin and Qingdao and become an important commercial port in the north. In recent years, those traveling along the Jinpu Railway and wanting to go to the Pinghan Railway, or traveling along the Pinghan Railway and wanting to go to the Jinpu Railway, have felt the pain of detour. In the future, the construction of Shiqi will not only connect the two major trunk lines of the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways in the north and south, but will also combine with the Zhengtai Railway to become the only major trunk line in China. All the fur products of Gansu and Shaanxi will be transported by this railway. It is reported that a capital of 15 million yuan has been raised, and a preparatory office has been temporarily set up in the French Concession of Tianjin. It will be moved to Pingri within the day to officially start work. The procedures for starting construction have also been completed, and construction can begin in mid-February.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Military Affairs Purchases New Weapons</h3>
<p>Sends Personnel to Europe, America, and Japan to Purchase</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beijing: The Army Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, in order to improve the manufacturing of military equipment, has sent personnel to Japan to investigate new weapons for imitation. After these investigators returned to China, they made a list of several items worth studying and submitted it to the Army Department, which then forwarded it to the Minister for review. The Minister approved the immediate purchase of two searchlights with a lens diameter of 1.5 meters. After receiving the approval, the Army Department, in addition to the searchlights, also plans to quickly purchase two work vehicles and attached vehicles for repairing cars, in order to actively study and apply them, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of military transportation. A budget was then prepared and submitted for approval: (1) Each searchlight, including the car, requires 64,000 Japanese yen; (2) a spare reflector requires 3,900 Japanese yen, totaling 131,900 Japanese yen, which is approximately equivalent to 263,800 Chinese dollars; (3) each work vehicle requires 11,000 Japanese yen; (4) each attached vehicle requires 8,800 Japanese yen, totaling 79,200 Chinese dollars. The total cost of all items is 343,100 yuan. This amount has been approved and will be raised by the Military Supply Department, and it has been decided that the work vehicles and attached vehicles will be purchased from Japan, while the other items will be purchased from European and American countries. The Military Supply Department and the Army Department will jointly send staff to make the purchases.</p>

<h3>The Future of the Shanxi Arsenal</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Taiyuan: After Li Guanglin, the director of the Northeast Arsenal, and Li Yichun, the director of the artillery factory, came to Taiyuan to inspect the Taiyuan Arsenal, Li Yichun returned to Shenyang yesterday to report on the actual situation of the arsenal. Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Party Department and the Post-War Rehabilitation Association have strongly advocated that the arsenal be transformed into a production facility. The Rehabilitation Association also sent Gao Xikong, an employee of the association, to accompany Li to Shenyang to appeal to Zhang Zuoxiang. Regarding the reorganization plan of the arsenal, a certain important employee of the arsenal said, "Since the Northeast sent personnel to inspect the arsenal, we have been ordered to make a total calculation of the machines, workers, and employees of each department of the arsenal. The calculation is about to be completed, but after the calculation, it is not yet clear whether it will be handed over to the Northeast or whether there will be other arrangements. We have not yet received a clear order. Once we have asked for instructions, we can make a concrete announcement. However, we recently received an official letter from the Post-War Rehabilitation Association, which strongly supports the transformation of the arsenal into a production facility. The authorities are said to be adopting this proposal and plan to convert one part of the arsenal into a steel mill, expanding the railway tracks of the Zhengtai Railway to the north to Datong and to the south to Fenglingdu, expanding the transportation of Shanxi as a whole. Another part will be converted into a manufacturing plant for mining machinery, taking advantage of the rich mineral deposits in Shanxi, hiring experts to vigorously exploit them, creating a new path for Shanxi. A third part will be converted into a manufacturing plant for agricultural machinery, hoping to greatly reform agriculture in Shanxi and create modern agricultural lands. Shanxi has always valued agriculture, but in recent years, industry in our country has not been developed, and agricultural implements are all old-fashioned, which has led to the decline of agricultural production. This is a most heartbreaking thing. If Shanxi can take the lead for our country at this time, it would not be bad. In addition, a part will be reserved for the manufacture of military equipment to prevent emergencies. And in fact, national defense cannot but be considered, and it is certainly not a long-term strategy to be without armaments when bandits are rampant."</p>
<h3>Fast Mail from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau on February 1st, the work has been extremely intense. The Construction Department recently ordered Director Chen to maintain the completed roads, to complete the completed but unfinished roads as soon as possible, and to temporarily suspend the planned but unstarted roads in order to save expenses. The Bureau considers that the first section of the highways that have been opened to traffic are the sections of Hangchang, Hangping, Gongshao, and Xiaoshao, The 130,000 allocated for the Hangfu road last year has been recovered and is under construction. It is expected to be open to traffic during the spring tea market. The income from the Xiaoshao section of the road is the most substantial, about 470,000 yuan per year. The total income of each road is over one million yuan. After deducting expenses, there is still a surplus of over 600,000 yuan. The Bureau is now planning to implement maintenance, and the amount of funds needed for each road has been ordered to be planned and implemented by the Vehicle Affairs Office.</p>

<h3>Anti-Communist Conference in Yanbian</h3>
<p>Zhang Shuhan is Ordered to Be Responsible for Handling</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jilin: The Korean Communists in Yanbian are rampant, burning and killing everywhere, and the people are living in misery. The Japanese are also using the pretext of protecting their residents to demand joint police administration. Zhang Shuhan, the Director of the Yanji Municipal Preparatory Office and concurrently the Administrative Supervisor of the four counties of Yanji, Hunchun, Helong, and Wangqing, went to the provincial capital before the New Year and proposed seven plans for governing Yanbian to the authorities. At the same time, various groups in Yanbian also sent representatives to the province to appeal. These representatives and Zhang traveled to Liaoning and Jilin for more than a month. Recently, the authorities finally approved the seven measures proposed by Zhang Shuhan, and Zhang Zuoxiang personally instructed Zhang Shuhan that the local areas of the counties in Yanbian are disturbed by bandits and communists, with frequent cases of murder and arson, which seriously harm the people's livelihood and are of great concern. He was ordered to supervise the county magistrates in properly planning measures for prevention and suppression and reporting to the authorities for review. Zhang Shuhan believed that this trip had yielded results and returned to Yanji on January 17. On the 18th, he telegraphed the magistrates of the four counties under his jurisdiction to attend a meeting in Yanji. It is reported that Cui Longzhen, the magistrate of Hunchun County, Xu Hongjian, the magistrate of Wangqing County, and Liu Zuyin, the magistrate of Helong County, arrived in Yanji on the 23rd one after another, and together with Sun Xiangqian, the magistrate of Yanji County, attended the meeting at the Supervisor's Office on the 24th. Zhang Shuhan chaired the meeting. Zhang first reported on his experiences in appealing to the province, and then discussed the implementation plans for adding police, suppressing communists, relieving financial difficulties, and settling the people. He also ordered the county magistrates to adhere to the Supervisor's Office and be responsible for prevention and suppression to secure the area and eliminate the Japanese ambitions. It is reported that Yanbian has gradually become more peaceful recently.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lisheng's Troops Vigorously Suppress Bandits in Western Chuzhou</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Bengbu: After the remnants of Ma Yuren's troops were defeated by Liang Guanying's troops in Jiangsu and fled to the border of Anhui, they were led by the leader Qi Yaozong and joined forces with Jiang Guochang's bandits to occupy the area of Lao Jiashan in northwestern Lai'an. They gathered eight or nine hundred people in that area, with complete firearms and sufficient ammunition. In the past week, they crossed the Jinpu Railway line from Lao Jiashan and harassed the area of Qilin Shangma, Zhulong Bridge, Daliu Dian, and Daishanpu in Chuzhou, and were distributed near Xiaoxi Township, Ma'anshan, Shijiaji, and Dachu, looting and kidnapping, creating a very rampant situation, so that western Chuzhou was disturbed and the people could not live in peace. Xu Peinan, the magistrate of Chuzhou County, telegraphed Zhang Guansheng, the commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division stationed in Bengbu, requesting him to quickly send troops to suppress them. After receiving the telegram, Zhang immediately dispatched Wang Xianzhang's 7th Regiment, Zhang Chuanfu's 8th Regiment, and Ma Jiewu's 12th Regiment, who were stationed in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway to protect the railway, to suppress them. It is now reported that three companies of the 7th Regiment set out from Sanjie and advanced towards Daishan to suppress them, and two companies each of the 8th and 12th Regiments set out from Shaheji in Chuzhou to advance towards Fanshan to suppress them. The bandits first occupied Daishan and Fanshan, relying on the danger to resist, but were then defeated by the fierce combined attacks of the troops and fled to the southwest. They reoccupied four or five villages, trying to resist stubbornly. The bandits occupying Dazhang Zhuang were broken by the companies in the snow, and many bandits were killed, many hostages were captured, and several bandit flags were captured. Only three soldiers were injured. The bandits were greatly frustrated in this battle, and the remnants of Ma Yuren's troops suffered even greater losses. It is said that only a hundred people remained, and they fled to Zhulong Bridge with Jiang Guochang's bandits. The troops of the 2nd Cavalry Division are still tracking and pursuing them. (February 12th)</p>
<h3>Fast Mail from Huwu</h3>
<p>He Chenjun is scheduled to convene a border area pacification conference for the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui in Wuhan. The generals of the three provinces must attend. Fan Xiji, the commander of the 46th Division stationed in Hefei, Anhui, is also among those invited. He recently telegraphed the Public Security Bureau here to hire a small steamer to pick him up in Hefei. It is expected to arrive in Wuhu tomorrow and transfer to a steamer to Wuhan.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaoshu, the director of the Anhui Official Property Reclamation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, came to Wuhu some time ago to prepare to move the Bureau from Anqing to Wuhu for the convenience of handling affairs. The Anhui Provincial Government insisted that the reclamation work should be carried out only after the measurement and clearing of the entire province has been completed, and ordered all counties to comply, resulting in the stagnation of the reclamation work. The move of the Bureau to Wuhu has also failed to materialize. Liu has gone to Beijing to ask the Ministry of Finance for instructions.</p>
<p>Bandits were found in Sanxingwei and other places bordering Dangtu and Wuhu in southern Anhui, attacking the local militia. Yu Yuying, the magistrate of Wuhu County, requested the 171st Brigade of the 57th Division stationed in Wuhu to send the 7th Company of the 341st Regiment to cooperate with the local militia in suppressing them. When Zhou Younian, the company commander, led his troops to cross the river to attack in Daxinwei, the bottom of the boat suddenly broke and sank. Company Commander Zhou and six soldiers, because they were carrying rifles and ammunition, could not swim and all drowned. After receiving the news, Brigade Commander Wang rushed to transfer the 12th Company, led by Yuan Xianyu, the deputy battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion, to take over the task of suppressing the bandits, and sent Zhang Shuming, the regimental adjutant, to retrieve the bodies of Company Commander Zhou and others, coffin them, and transport them to Wuhu. Magistrate Yu, because Company Commander Zhou was brave in suppressing the bandits and died unexpectedly, launched a fundraising campaign to hold a memorial service at the Youth Association on the 13th.</p>
<p>In recent days, robbery cases have occurred frequently in the bustling areas of Wuhu. The Daoxiangcun Tea and Food Shop on Dama Road, a grocery store on Erjie, and the Zheng family near the Catholic Church have all been robbed one after another. Therefore, Brigade Commander Wang of the 171st Brigade has been dispatching armed soldiers to stand guard from yesterday, from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>The Seventh Provincial Middle School on Zheshan has been very successful in recent years, with about 300 students. However, the school is built on Zheling, and drinking water is extremely difficult. Ke Defa, the principal of the school, has submitted a request to the Education Department to drill an artesian well, which is about to be completed. The Education Department, recognizing Ke's earnestness in running the school and his competence in handling affairs, has specially issued an order to commend him.</p>
<p>Yesterday, people from all walks of life here held a joint meeting at the Orphanage, deciding to follow the order of the Ministry to rename the Orphanage to Nursery, and to elect Lu Tingzhen as the director. They also planned fundamental improvement measures for the Orphanage's handling of babies, which has been corrupt for many years, with repeated deaths of infants. (February 9th)</p>

<p>The Qingxiang Investigation Must Be Completed Within the Time Limit: Jin Qingzhang, the County Magistrate and concurrently the Director of the Qingxiang Bureau, recently issued an order to all district offices to comply with the procedure, that the Qingxiang procedures are complicated and the household registration investigation should be completed within the time limit. This household registration investigation must be completed and reported by the end of February.</p>
<h3>Jinshan</h3>
<p>Bandit Forces in Southern Jinshan Are Still Rampant: In the southern townships of Jinshan, in the past two months, they have almost fallen into the world of bandits, with looting, killing, and arson, leaving the area in darkness. The Songhu Garrison Commander has appointed Battalion Commander Zhang, originally stationed in Songjiang, to join forces with Battalion Commander Bai of the Security Team stationed in Jinshanwei, and County Magistrate Huang and Secretary Qu to lead their teams to Zhangyan, hold suppression meetings, and vigorously suppress the bandits in separate groups. Although many important bandit party members have been captured, the bandit leaders Taibao A'shu, Zhu A'mei, Lu Yaosheng, and Tailor A, etc., still lead their followers in the old nest of Liu Jia Yanqiao and Qianwei, scurrying around. The army always cannot find the way and they only have spotty success, making it difficult to suppress them. It is now reported that the county government and various local offices have publicly requested the Security Office to order Battalion Commander Bai to dispatch a company of troops to be permanently stationed in Qianwei to search and suppress the bandits nearby, and have requested the Garrison Commander not to transfer Battalion Commander Zhang elsewhere until all the bandits have been completely suppressed.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>The Situation of the Opening of the Nancang River Project Case: The reimbursement control case for the Nancang River project has now been summoned by the Zhenjiang Court Procuratorate for a collective interrogation at 1:00 PM on the day before yesterday (10th). On the defendant side, there were the two directors, Jiang Rongchu and Zhang Fengtai, the accountant Chen Shiqian, Jiang Shiyi, (did not appear in court), and the clerks Xu Mianfu and Tang Zixiong, etc. On the plaintiff side, there were Xu Yizhou, Shen Baoming, Zhuang Zhengxiong, Shi Xiangyun (representative), Zhuang Xiaobo, Yuan Keming, and Tang Baosheng, etc. In addition, there were the River Works Committee member Zhuang Shiru, the waterwheel contractor Cai Shuitang, etc., for a total of 22 people. They were all questioned one by one by the prosecutor, and the main individuals were questioned separately. As a result, due to the strict seal, it is impossible to publish, but it is known that in the court order, in addition to the two directors, Jiang and Zhang, being guarded by the Water Conservancy Bureau, the rest were separately released on bail, and the date for continued interrogation was extended.</p>
<p>Yicang Negotiated and Prepared Documents: Since the restoration, the abundant farmlands in this county have been managed by the former Encouragement of Learning Institute and transferred for use as county education expenses. It was not until the Republic that they were recovered by the Property Office and returned to the accumulated grain. However, at that time, the two parties argued for a long time, even resulting in the pulling of rents. Although litigation was involved in the official office, the result was not officially resolved, so all the documents are still held by the Education Bureau to this day. Now, the Yicang Committee, for the sake of solemnly securing the property rights, sent a letter to inquire the day before yesterday, but the Education Bureau, because the case has not yet been settled, felt that it was not appropriate to act alone, so it submitted it to the current County Education Administration Conference for resolution. The Bureau then submitted it to the County Government yesterday for transmittal to the next County Administration Conference for review.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Evidence Found in the Ma Robbery Case in Heyang Mountain: Ma Guanbing's house in Hou Dai, near Heyang Mountain in the Phoenix District of this county, was robbed by bandits the day before yesterday, and Guanbing's wife's lower body, etc., was burned with fire. It is now reported that the victim, Ma Guanbing, discovered a burlap bag on the way when he went to the market to buy goods. It contained clothing, etc., which he confirmed to be the stolen items. There were the words "Xiang Xi Zhuang San" on the bag, and he immediately took it back and reported it to the District Office. According to general speculation, this rattan bag was lost by the bandits on the way. Since the bag has the words "Xiang Xi Zhuang San", it is not difficult to follow this clue to solve the case.</p>
<p>Most of the Daily Newspapers Have Suspended Publication: There are more than a dozen daily newspapers published in this county every day, but they are all printed by printing houses on behalf of the papers. Now that it is the end of the lunar year and the printing house workers have stopped working, most of the daily newspapers have either reorganized internally or have stopped publication because their contracts have expired. There are only one or two newspapers that are still publishing as usual.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Difficulties of Eradicating Old Customs: The County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, due to the intention of barbershops and bathhouses in the area to increase prices during the Lunar New Year, in order to eliminate bad habits, sent a letter to the county government to issue a strict prohibition. Unexpectedly, the barbershops collectively posted red printed notices for days, stating: "In accordance with the county party department's proposal, to cancel the Lunar New Year's Eve price increase, agreed upon by all businesses in the industry to maintain a livelihood, during the accounting period, patrons are requested to give double the tip." This was discovered by Zhang Hentian, a standing committee member of the County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee. Yesterday, he took police officers to the barbershops, tore off the red printed notices, and sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, ordering them to investigate and stop the practice to uphold the law.</p>
<p>Provincial Order to Protect Business Firms and Guild Halls: The county government received an instruction from the provincial government yesterday, stating that the Ministry of Industry had issued a consultation, finding that business firms and guild halls in various provinces and cities have traditionally been jointly operated by local resident merchants or those in the same industry, in order to connect emotions and develop commerce. The law is inherently good, but recently merchant groups in various places have reported that guild halls have been encroached upon, confiscated, or their properties changed hands. If this is true, it is very inappropriate. It is the duty of the Ministry to focus on gathering merchant strength, implement unity, and jointly plan for foreign affairs. These historical organizations should be maintained and improved, and should not be rashly destroyed. In addition to separate instructions, please investigate and protect them strictly to stabilize commerce, etc. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Pan has already complied with it.</p>
<p>Borrowing Public Housing of Abolished Tax Bureaus: The public houses, equipment, firearms, and boats of the various tax bureaus that were abolished in the county were previously ordered by the Department of Finance to be handed over to the county government for safekeeping and inventorying. Now, the establishment of the Business Tax Collection Bureau and its offices requires housing and equipment, and they have petitioned the Department of Finance. Yesterday, the county government received instructions from the Department of Finance, ordering that the items handed over by the various tax bureaus be temporarily transferred to the various bureaus for borrowing. The firearms, etc., should still be properly preserved by the county, and a separate list of the situation should be submitted for verification.</p>
<p>Most Urban and Rural Telephones Out of Service: Due to continuous heavy snowfall, the accumulated snow on the ground is about four inches thick, causing most of the telephone poles in the county to be broken by the weight. As a result, hundreds of urban and rural telephones are out of service. Although the telephone company has hired workers to repair them day and night, the situation has not yet been restored. During this winter defense period, when businesses are settling their accounts, they rely entirely on telephones for quick communication. The company's general manager, Yang Renqian, in addition to continuing to order workers to speed up repairs day and night, submitted a report to the County Construction Bureau for review the other day.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Business Association Decides to Extend Small Railway Station Loan: The Zhenjiang Business Association recently received a letter from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau regarding the extension of the branch line from the small railway station to the Zhenjiang customs station, requesting the immediate preparation of funds for construction. Since this project requires more than 134,000 yuan, a meeting must be held to resolve the issue. Therefore, a meeting of executive committee members was convened yesterday afternoon at 3:00 to discuss the method. The following resolutions were made: (1) Reply to the Railway Bureau agreeing to the railway extension plan to the customs station; (2) Regarding the earthwork and land work, etc., totaling 32,900 yuan, it will be undertaken by the association. The purchase of land and various construction materials totaling 101,470 yuan will be funded by the Railway Bureau, and the association will provide a loan; (3) A total of 134,370 yuan will be borrowed from the banking industry by Chairman Lu, with each industry responsible. The following methods were also discussed: (1) The association will lend 100,000 yuan to the Railway Bureau, to be repaid monthly from the Railway Bureau's business income, with 10,000 yuan to be repaid monthly without interest for ten months; (2) The principal and interest of the 32,900 yuan undertaken by the association and the interest on the 100,000 yuan loan will be added to the wharf tax of 20 cents per ton for railway freight in the port, with a term of two years. After clearing the principal and interest, the remainder will be used to dredge shallow waters near the station and wharf; (3) The Railway Bureau must start construction as soon as the tide recedes. The Railway Bureau is responsible for any overruns in the budget or losses in the project. All of the above must be contracted by the association and the Railway Bureau and handled in accordance with the agreement.</p>
<p>Security Office Executes Huaian Police Captain for Aiding Bandits: The Jiangsu Provincial Security Office previously received a police captain named Cao Zhixiang from Huaian County, who was accused of colluding with bandits and harming the people. After a detailed interrogation, he admitted to colluding with bandits and was sentenced to death. The sentence was reported to the provincial government for review and approval, and yesterday (12th) at around 10:00 AM, he was taken to the North Gate execution ground and executed by firing squad. In addition, two bandits from Danyang, Ni Songshan and Yao Yunqing, were also sentenced to death and were sent to Danyang yesterday by clerk Zhang Bingyan for execution.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Administrative Sanctions in the County Middle School Case Are Final: Bao Han, the principal of Jiangdu County Middle School, was accused by Shi Songyu and others of embezzling public funds. The case was ordered by the provincial government to be thoroughly investigated, but the files were stolen and transferred to the judiciary. The investigation court held four sessions, but no prosecution has been filed. However, it is heard that the administrative aspect has now been transferred by the provincial government to the Department of Education for separate sanctions. The general meaning of the document is that the director of the bureau, Chen Da, was negligent in preventing the theft of the bureau's files and failed to solve the case in a timely manner, which is a dereliction of duty and should be recorded as a major demerit, and he should be given a deadline to investigate the person who stole the files and hand them over to the court for punishment in accordance with the law. As for Principal Bao Han, although there is no evidence of theft, he is indeed suspected of embezzlement and should be dismissed from his position and await judicial resolution. The position of principal should be filled by the county magistrate, who should promptly select and submit candidates for review and appointment. It is now heard that County Magistrate Chen has selected three people and submitted them to the Department of Education for selection.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Education Sector Demands Salaries: The education sector in the county has been in arrears with salaries for five months. With the end of the year approaching for shops, the teachers and staff are in urgent need of money. Yesterday (10th) at 3:00 PM, the directors of various social education institutions and the principals of various schools went to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Wang and request that he order the Finance Bureau to quickly raise more than 70,000 yuan to fully pay the outstanding salaries. The meeting ended at 8:00 PM without any results. This afternoon at 3:00 PM, the directors of various social education institutions and the principals of various schools will go to the county government again to discuss the matter with County Magistrate Wang.</p>

<p>Two Bandits Killed North of Xincang: On the afternoon of the 10th, two bandit ships with more than 20 bandits were discovered near the Dacheng Nunnery north of Xincang Town, Pinghu. A Jiangsu provincial army happened to pass by and saw the bandit ships. They ordered a search, but the bandits landed and ambushed themselves by the river and opened fire. The army returned fire, and the two sides fought for about two hours. The bandits were eventually repelled by the army. Two bandits were killed on the spot, and two bandit ships were captured. More than 20 quilts and several bags of clothing were found on board.</p>

He was sent to the county government on the 12th. The trial was opened by examining magistrate Song, and as a result of the interrogation, He was ordered to find a reliable shop as guarantor and await submission to the Department of Civil Affairs for review.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Cables Request for Delay in Levying Business Tax: The Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce Unification Committee stated that the business tax will soon be levied, but the various tax rates set are several times or dozens of times higher than the regulations promulgated by the Ministry. Merchants and people in various places believe that the burden is too heavy to accept and have submitted petitions to the authorities for separate reductions. Therefore, yesterday, they cabled the Department of Finance, ordering the various bureau chiefs to postpone the levy until the draft is approved by the Central Government, the tax rates are determined, and the merchants and people can accept them, in order to avoid disturbances.</p>
<p>Reconciliation in the Lian Sidang Demolition Case: In Jiaxing's Lian Sidang, Yan Jintai and others organized the Taishan Fishing Company and built a curtain to raise fish in the pond. Later, it was demolished by Yangxi Village, and both sides filed lawsuits with the official government. The court had summoned them many times, but no judgment had been made. It is now learned that a third party came forward to mediate, persuading Yan and others to abandon their losses. Yan has accepted an unconditional resolution, so the case can be temporarily concluded.</p>

<p>Continued Interrogation of Pirates Who Ambushed Xinning-Taiwan Vessels: The Overseas Water Police Bureau dispatched the Jinghai warship and other vessels to encircle and suppress the pirates who robbed the Xinning-Taiwan vessels. It is now learned that those who went to encircle and suppress included the Third Guerilla Squad, the Sixth Water Patrol Squad, and the Seventh Water Patrol Squad of the Water Police Bureau. As a result of the encirclement and suppression, the pirates Ying Gongshan, Liang Meichuan, Chen Xianwei, Jiang Shaomei, Li San, Li Xin’s wife, Li Xiangmao, Li Xiuyun, Lu Yuanbo, Huang Haicai, and Zhang Dewu and others, totaling twelve people, were captured alive. Six Russian rifles, four local quick rifles, two German rifles, one nine-shot pistol, one mainland rifle, and one six-inch hand cannon, totaling fifteen firearms, were seized. When the soldiers and bandits were engaged in fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and attempted to escape by large boats, but the bandit boats were sunk by artillery fire from the Jinghai warship, killing twenty bandits. After the guerilla squad and water patrol squad directly attacked the bandit’s lair, they also killed more than fifty bandits and rescued twelve hostages. On the water police side, Water Police Xiang died in battle, and Chen Renjie and Jin Gao were injured. The water patrol squad and others fought fiercely with the bandits for a long time, consuming a total of 4,446 bullets and two shells. The water patrol squad and others have jointly reported the encirclement and suppression to the Water Police Bureau, which has forwarded it to the Department of Civil Affairs for review.</p>
<p>Bandits Everywhere in Fenghua (1): A nun named Jing’an, who lived in Baiyun Nunnery, located about one mile outside the South Gate of Fenghua, had some savings. One night a few days ago, six or seven bandits suddenly came and looted at will. All valuables were taken away. (2) Bandit chiefs Sun Libiao, Shen Yong, etc., led their followers and anchored four boats in the Shitou Ya Sheng Ke area of Fenghua, making them temporary bandit lairs. For days, they sent letters to wealthy households in nearby villages, extorting huge sums of money. It is heard that Wu Gongfan, a wealthy household in Daqi, received a letter demanding 20,000 yuan, and Wang Shuqin received a letter demanding 10,000 yuan. Zhou Heting of Chunhu Street also received a letter demanding 2,000 yuan, all of which were to be raised within three days. (3) At around 3:00 PM the other day in Zhanghu Village, Songlin District, Fenghua, more than 50 bandits arrived with the intention of kidnapping wealthy people. More than 30 brave young men in the village resisted with guns, which angered the bandits. The bandits then shot people on sight, killing more than 30 people.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>400,000 Stones of Rice in the Urban Area: In the past, Hangzhou's rice supply mostly relied on external sources. However, due to the abundant harvests of crops last year, supplies were readily available, and prices gradually decreased. In December of last year, the city's rice prices slightly increased, with top-quality rice increasing from eleven yuan to twelve yuan and two dimes. Recently, there have been more sources of supply, and sales have been sluggish. The recent rice reserves total more than 400,000 stones, which can supply the urban area for two to three months.</p>
<p>Inland Water Launches Announce Suspension of Service: The inland water launches in Zhejiang Province, due to the Lunar New Year holidays, which cannot be avoided, have been decided by the various bureaus to suspend service uniformly from yesterday (13th). However, the last batch of launches to Suzhou, Wuxi, Huzhou, Hebei, Pingtan, and Shanghai departed yesterday morning.

<p>Wife: You don't quite measure up to my ideal husband.</p>
<p>Husband: What should your ideal husband be like? Wife: I want him to be strong and heroic, yet silent and peaceful, so that I can look up to him and admire him.</p>
<p>Husband: Then you might as well go to London, England, and marry the statue of the naval hero Nelson.</p>
<p>Teacher (to the students): Today, I want to talk to you about the way of love. You should love each other.</p>

<p>Car Salesman: Our car is imported. How could it not be properly installed? I think you should get another fiancée.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Affairs of Wu Peifu</h3>
<p>He Lin</p>
<p>A guest came from Sichuan, recounting Wu Peifu's trivial matters, quite humorous, so I recorded them one by one. It was previously mistakenly reported that Ziyu, the scholar, was critically ill. Now it is known to be inaccurate. The reason for the misreport is also seen below.</p>
<p>Yang Sen Calls Wu His Poetry Disciple: Wu was in Sichuan, taking shelter under Yang Sen. Yang Sen was somewhat versed in literature and has enjoyed writing poetry since the year before last. He occasionally sent his poems to Wu. Wu would revise them and send them back, with a few words of praise. Thus, Yang Sen wrote to Wu, often calling himself Wu’s poetry disciple. Wu also liked to tell people about it, saying that if Yang Sen abandoned military affairs and devoted himself to poetry, he would become his indoor disciple.</p>
<p>Calligraphy and Paintings Widely Circulated in Sichuan: Wu would respond to those who asked for calligraphy and paintings, instructing his doormen not to hinder them. He used to only paint bamboo, but recently he also became capable of painting orchids. The inscriptions on the paintings were all his own poems. When writing for others, he initially wrote in cursive script, but now he also writes in official script. He was very busy keeping up with the demand.</p>
<p>Hiring People to Carve More Than a Hundred Seals: There was a man from Sichuan named Jin Yunhe who was skilled at stone carving. Wu praised him highly at first sight, saying that this man's iron pen captured the legacy of Deng Shiru. He invited him to meet and asked him to engrave seals. It is said that in one or two years, he carved more than a hundred seals for Wu. In addition to engraving ancient poems and his own poems, most of them were titles Wu had given himself after entering Sichuan, such as "Failed Hero," "Sour Scholar," "Old Sour," "Drunk Lying on the Battlefield," "Literary Soldier," "Retired Veteran," and "Gardening Hermit." There were countless others like these, mostly containing feelings of injustice. When painting orchids, he often used Banqiao's phrase, "Breaking the Black Basin to Enter the Mountain," a seven-character seal. Observers said that it fit his position exactly.</p>
<p>Recently Called Himself the Four No's Elder: Wu was ill in the autumn and bedridden for more than half a month. He once composed several dirges and elegiac couplets on the spot. Outsiders mistakenly reported that he was critically ill, probably due to this. The narrator only remembered his elegiac couplets, saying, "When successful, be honest and conscientious, do not take concubines, and do not accumulate money. Drinking and composing poetry is still the nature of a scholar. After failure, be stubbornly determined, do not go abroad, and do not go to the concessions. Gardening is a genuine return to the countryside after retiring from military service." The gatekeeper said that both the upper and lower couplets used the word "not," which seemed repetitive. Wu laughed and said, "This is not the examination hall of the former Qing Dynasty. What does repetition matter?" Therefore, he called himself the "Four No's Elder." It is also said that the dirges contained phrases such as "millions of sand worms and three thousand iron cavalry." He was skilled in antithesis, and his energy was strong, so it is known that he will not die soon.</p>
<h3>Recording the Madness of Rabid Dogs</h3>
<p>Qing</p>
<p>A few days ago, rabid dogs were discovered biting people in our county (Jiading) city. It was around 8:00 AM, when there were many pedestrians in the city center. Therefore, those who were bitten could not avoid it. Thus, the disaster caused by rabid dogs was even more severe than in the past. This time, it finally gained the attention of the local authorities. This must be recorded, and it is also hoped that it can be remedied in the future to avoid this undeserved disaster and to avoid suffering this poison again.</p>
<p>The rabid dog on that day came from the Dry Grass Bay outside the East Gate, only five or six miles from the city. It was raised by a certain family. The dog's body was not very large and was yellow and white. It was actually an ordinary pet dog. It is not known why it suddenly acted like a family dog going mad. It ran straight to the vicinity of the East Gate, passed through Spring Bridge, went southeast to Xie Jing, turned back and entered the city. It first arrived at Qiliang School next to the City Temple, almost harming it. The school used the telephone to call the County Public Security Bureau, urging them to take precautions. The dog had already reached the west side of the East City Bridge and had bitten several people. The most seriously injured was a villager who was selling straw sandals. Both of his knees were bleeding profusely and dripping to the ground, so he had to leave in pain. The police officers on the roadside at the time did not take it seriously and ignored it. Unexpectedly, the dog passed west of Zhou Bridge and turned south again, passing through Ordinary School. It bit a female student surnamed Li who was about to enter the school. Fortunately, she was not injured because she happened to use a book in her hand to defend herself, so only the book was destroyed by it. The strangest thing was that a woman surnamed Yan, who lived with her husband's family outside the West Gate, happened to come out of her house that morning and encountered the dog. Because no one was catching the dog, it was allowed to run wildly out of the city, and the woman happened to meet it, so she was bitten by it. She tried to resist with her hands, but her palms and the tiger's mouth were invaded by its claws and teeth. Her poisoning was probably the same as the villager's, or even worse. It is estimated that the dog bit more than 30 people that morning. Their names could not be determined in detail. Later, it was finally beaten to death with a stick by someone in Xilu Village, west of the Huiji Sauce Garden, and sent to the Cunren Hospital in front of the pagoda in the city to test for the presence of rabies.</p>
<p>Zhang Hongnian's family in Qiannanli, our county, raised a small dog that looked like a lion and was so playful that people loved it. It was said to have been obtained from a man surnamed Gao in Shanghai. In the eleventh month of last year, his sister-in-law was bitten by it. Before long, she died. Those in the family who were fortunate enough to avoid the poison had to spend a lot of money on medical treatment and medicine. There was a suggestion to ban dog ownership, but the authorities turned a deaf ear. This time, at the initiative of Gu Xuchu, the district chief of the first district of the city, all dog owners must use muzzles, otherwise the Public Security Bureau will be responsible for catching them. He also purchased various kinds of rabies medicines from Shanghai and ordered the city police to investigate those who had been bitten and quickly come to the hospital for injections. He also warned the public with cans to guard against unforeseen circumstances. This is indeed an urgent matter that the local authorities should not delay. Therefore, I am happy to record it.</p>
<h3>Things to Know About Raising Dogs</h3>
<p>Qiu Shui</p>
<p>Western women love dogs, and it has almost become a fashion. Since the eastward spread of European customs, it is often seen on the streets that Chinese men and women take dogs with them. It is generally known that dogs have gained the universal love of mankind. Because there are so many Westerners who love dogs, the art of raising dogs has become a specialized discipline. In addition to the cat and dog barbershops in New York and London, there are also specialized cat and dog hospitals. Various magazines often publish various kinds of common sense about raising dogs. I have selected the essentials and translated them to share with enthusiasts.</p>
<p>(1) Every morning, drive it out of the house to let it get some fresh air and to allow it to excrete as much waste as possible. Over time, it will become a habit, and the room will not be soiled, which will hinder hygiene.</p>
<p>(2) Dogs should be washed regularly to remove dirt and prevent disease. However, after washing, it must be wiped dry with a dry towel and then combed with a comb, otherwise it is easy to catch a cold or suffer from lung disease.</p>
<p>(3) Winter is a dangerous time for all kinds of animals. Dogs are no exception. Dog owners should clothe them during the day and provide them with a warm dog bed at night. The bed should always be kept clean and frequently brushed to avoid the growth of pests.</p>
<p>(4) If a dog's body is unclean, it is easy to breed lice. Washing it from a young age with medicated soap or puppy soap (available in pharmacies) can prevent this.</p>
<p>(5) If a dog's blood is unclean, it is easy to cause mange. At this time, in addition to washing frequently with medicated water, it is also advisable to seek medical attention quickly, otherwise the mange will spread to the human body, causing no small harm.</p>
<p>(6) Dog food should be refined, not much. Beef is the only good product, but it should not be eaten too much, and it should not be mixed with salty juice.</p>
<p>(7) Dogs should not eat salty food or ham bones, otherwise they will have an unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>(8) Dog necks should not be constantly tied with straps.</p>
<p>(9) Dogs must be treated with both severity and kindness.</p>
<p>(10) A dog's nose is usually wet. If it is dry, it must be sick. It should be treated quickly.</p>
<p>(11) During the mating period of female dogs, they should be mated with males of the same species, otherwise it is easy to cause difficult labor.</p>
<p>(12) Long-haired dogs should have their hair cut in the summer so that the dog's body is cool. After autumn, the hair will grow longer and shinier.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>(119) Ling Hua</p>
<p>What is noteworthy is the life habits and thoughts of the lower classes of India. These are black people, also known as Kala people. After all, Chinese people have a habit of self-importance and look down on all kinds of people, calling them mixed names, such as calling Westerners "red-haired devils," Burmese "old Burmese," and black people "black devils." Black people have the most pitiful lives and are the largest laboring class in various parts of Southeast Asia. I was very sympathetic to their lives in Singapore and briefly recorded them. I remember once I lived in the New Mountain Temple and was about to enter, but the door would not open. I was carrying things and could not open the door myself. A Kala person passed by and respectfully opened the door for me. I was very happy. When I got to Burma, there were even more black people, and the Burmese were quite polite, serving very carefully. When they met people, they would pull rickshaws and give them money, which they would receive with both hands and express their respect. If they walked in front of people, they would bend over and bow. (Burmese women also do this.) Chinese people also treat them badly. For example, if they give them rickshaw fare and they argue, they will hit them with a stick, and they will run away. And Burmese women often order them to pull rickshaws without giving them money. These people often sleep in the gaps between people at night and spend a dozen or so copper coins a day. However, they are not only laborers. Their nature is extremely docile and without complaint. I am very strange about this. Compared to the current labor community in China, whose momentum is increasing a thousand miles a day, with the momentum to overthrow capital and the intellectual class, and the tea room in the Guangdong Inn is especially strange because it does not accept calls and does not entertain guests. When I asked people who knew the situation in India, I learned that the reason why the Kala workers in India are so poor but do not complain is due to the Indian religion. Indian religion says that when humans were first born, the first class of people was divided from a certain god's body. They were born from the god's head, so they are the most noble and are monks. The next class of people was born from the arms, which is also noble, so they are emperors. The next class of people was born from under the belly, so they are merchants. The lowest class of people was born from the lower part, so they are laborers. This Indian class system was created by mythology. This religion has not declined to this day, so laborers are not resentful and are willing to come from the lowliest of families. The Buddhist scriptures often say that the Chandalas walk on the road without daring to stand in front of people, fearing that people will touch them, so they shake their tin staff to avoid noble people. Monks should also be humble when they leave home and learn to "shake the tin." The source of the two words "shake the tin" is also. To this day, the Kala workers are so content with their lives and do not regret it. I am very surprised at the depth and difficulty of changing the divine religion, and that the Buddha's equality has failed to change it in thousands of years. Moreover, Buddhism has completely failed. From this point of view, politics is indispensable. Things will turn around when they reach the extreme. The large number of Kala people in India, if they encounter the teachings and movement of Russian workers in the future, will be transformed from inferiority to sacredness. I am afraid that there will be a day when they will hold their heads high in the world and should not be underestimated.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart</h3>
<p>(370) Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Emerald Eyebrows with Skills to Preserve Youth, Golden Market for Horse Bones, No Way to Extend Life</p>
<p>That foreigner... after fitting the wristwatch on Hua Yuanchun, he scrutinized it again. He held her hand, patted her shoulder, and then chattered with that guest for a while. Hua Lao Liu softly said to the guest, "That foreign gentleman who receives the misfortunes... he's praising me, isn't he?" The guest said, "He's complimenting you. Why would you scold him? He said your arm is very white, and wearing that wristwatch makes it look even whiter. If it were on a thin wrist, it wouldn't look so good. Because your hand is so white and smooth, it looks especially fitting." Whether it's Chinese or foreign, men or women, they always take to flattery and sweet words. Hua Lao Liu was happy to hear that the foreigner also praised her, of course she was willing. She also greeted the foreigner with a smiling face. The guest said, "Then it's this one." Hua Yuanchun nodded and said she didn't know how much it cost. The guest said, "Don't worry about it. I'm giving it to you." He chattered with the foreigner again. The foreigner took out a small booklet from his side, used a fountain pen clipped to the pocket of his Western-style vest, signed a slip, and gave it to the foreigner. The foreigner bowed to them both, then put the wristwatch in a purple leather case, inside a box lined with blue satin. He handed it to Hua Lao Liu. Hua Lao Liu didn't know how much the wristwatch cost. She couldn't read foreign words, nor did she know how much the guest's signed slip was for. It wasn't until the two of them were sitting in the carriage that Hua Yuanchun asked the guest how much it cost. The guest said, "A small matter, four hundred and fifty dollars. It was originally going to be five hundred, but because I recognized that foreigner a little, I had done business with him before, so he gave me a 10% discount." Hua Yuanchun was naturally very happy. At that time, wristwatches were just becoming popular among women, and hers was a white gold wristwatch with embedded diamonds. When she went to performances or the theater, it glittered in the many lights. Many unsophisticated young sisters saw it and asked, "Sixth Elder Sister, how did you buy a silver wristwatch?" Hua Yuanchun smiled proudly and said, "This wristwatch is called platinum." One young sister said, "Oh, is platinum more expensive than gold?" Hua Lao Liu said, "I heard it's twenty times more expensive." When people asked her how much she bought it for, she added some exaggeration, randomly saying seven hundred or eight hundred dollars. People half-believed it. Later, that guest returned to Nanyang. Hua Lao Liu, to commemorate that guest, still wore it on her hand. One day, somehow, a small diamond around the wristwatch fell off. It was that little A'bao, who, although small, had very sharp eyes. She saw a shiny thing in front of the bed and asked, "Is this from your ring?" Hua Yuanchun looked. There were no missing stones on the ring. Looking again at the wristwatch, there was a small gap left.</p>

<h3>Gold and Money Markets Show Soaring Prices Again</h3>
<p>High of Nineteen Taels</p>
<p>Fluctuations Reach Thirty-Three Taels. Yesterday, February 13th, the price of gold saw a sudden and sharp rise of twenty taels. However, market changes are unpredictable, with fluctuations of several to ten taels constantly. The situation in the Persian Gulf is turbulent. Throughout the day, there was a discrepancy of thirty-two to thirty-three taels, which is a significant amount. It seems that both official and unofficial foreign exchange rates are strained. Listed prices have been reduced by two and a half points. As for trading on the floor, it remains stable and active. In the early market, Hongli, Yuanxing, Yongcheng, and Fengyong all made purchases. Zhifeng, Yongxin, Hengyuan, and Maoyong all occupied the selling side. Overseas silver markets have reported lower prices, with the U.S. markets closed for a holiday. However, the initial gold price was flat. Subsequently, because there seemed to be more sellers, it once retreated near the fifty tael mark. Afterwards, buyers were eager, and prices rose again. There was a slight pause, but at noon, the exchange rate became more expensive. Furthermore, major players such as Hengxing, Taikang, Runyuan, and Xingyong showed strong buying interest, especially with frequent and sharp price increases. The price suddenly jumped out of the seventy tael mark, rising sharply by two taels. Later in the market, Taikang, Run, Hongli and other companies continued to buy, while Hengxing had already sold. Foreign exchange became even tighter. Moreover, there were rumors that overseas telegrams reported a sharp drop in silver prices, making it difficult to remedy the situation. Upon hearing this news, the market sentiment suddenly surged, and prices rose by more than ten taels, quickly exceeding the 780 tael mark. In an instant, a storm arose. Hengxing and others sold, and also learned that the Indian exchange rate fell and then rose, causing a sharp drop of more than ten taels. The situation seemed foolish and aimless, drifting with the wind. Finally, the total was fifty-four or five taels. Yesterday afternoon, the industry had already made forward swaps privately. The multi-party initially posted six or seven taels, then five taels eight or nine cents, and then raised it again to seven taels. The Dalian and Guangdong groups, including Hengxing, had mutual swaps. It is said that Hengxing first swapped in short positions, about three thousand contracts. Also, many firms completed transactions. This morning, large contracts may continue to fall slightly.</p>
<p>Morning Trade Soars Straight Up. The gold market for March opened this morning with a slight increase of five cents, totaling 756 taels and five cents. Although large bars of silver are down by sixteen and five-tenths of a cent, silver prices are uneventful, and the European market is uncertain, so the market sentiment is also flat. Subsequently, due to sales by companies such as Tongtaichang, Zhifeng, Yongfuchang, prices fell sharply from 57 and a half taels to 49 and a half taels. Suddenly, HSBC and others bought May British gold at 123.75, and then the price rose again by more than four taels, totaling 54 taels. The initial price was announced as two and a half taels, and the listing was reduced by 125 US dollars. The 25th gold was up one and a half points. Chengfengyong and Hengxing and others bought in, immediately increasing the price to 55 taels. Then, Xinhang sold it, and it retreated again to 52 taels. After 10 o'clock, Hengxing bought again, and Taikangrun, Yuanheng, Yuanxingyong and others came to buy, especially with British gold being mutually transacted by banks from 1225 to 16875. Therefore, the gold price rose by 7 or 8 taels until 11:00, totaling 60 taels. Then it immediately depreciated by more than one tael. Yuanchengyong, Hongli and others bought in again, reaching 62 taels at 11:30. Zhifengyong Xinhang sold out. In just seven or eight minutes, it dropped by two taels. Suddenly, Yuanxingyong, Yuanhengtangkangrun had released it, showing a charming appearance. The total reached 67 taels and five cents. By the time of the noon closing at 66 taels and two cents, the British gold suddenly changed and was reduced by 125 US dollars. The 5th gold was increased by one and a half points, and the buyers were excited. The price continued to be made to 72 taels. The initial listed price was 823 taels and four cents, reduced by eighty taels or so. At noon, it was changed to 840 taels and 06 cents, reduced by sixty-eight or ninety taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market is Stormy. The afternoon market opened at 72 and a half taels, then at 5 and a half taels. Because news came that the silver market was in turmoil and difficult to maintain, the market sentiment was agitated. Subsequently, it dropped slightly by two taels, totaling 71 and a half taels. Indian exchange rates were small. Ri Taikangrun and others bought in. It was said that the time rose to 79 taels seven or eight cents, and sometimes retreated to 6 taels. Then Hengxing came to sell. At 2:30, the initial price was suddenly reduced again by 375. US dollar, 75-day gold rose by more than five points, and Chinese and Japanese banks mutually transacted April British gold at 1175. HSBC also ate 8125, so the market sentiment was extremely strong. Around 2 o'clock, it suddenly reached 82 taels. No matter how Hengxing Fuchang and others sold tirelessly, almost the internal British gold price turned flat. Taiwan issued May 119375, so the gold price was difficult to stabilize and immediately went downstream. Soon after, the news that the Indian exchange rate had risen again was added to the market, which privately opened swaps, so the short time turned from strong to weak, with a violent drop of more than 11 taels. At about 4 o'clock, it retreated to 70 taels and five cents. After that, there was a rise and fall of one or two taels. When it was about to close, Yuanheng Zhenchangxiang and others had a lot of dragging in. It was pulled up by 5 taels, totaling 75 and a half taels. At 4:30 p.m. when the market closed, the total was 775 taels, which was an increase of 19 taels compared to the previous day. From morning to night, the highest price was 82 taels, and the lowest price was 49 and a half taels, a difference of 32 taels and five cents. The goods opened early at 59 taels, closed at noon at 67 and a half taels, 71 taels in the afternoon, and 72 and a half taels at the close. The listed price has been changed to 864 taels and six cents, reducing by eighty-two or three taels. Later, it actually exceeded ninety-four taels and closed at 9 taels. The logged numbers were 61 taels to 66 taels in the morning, and 66 taels to 71 taels in the afternoon. The water subsidy was 61 taels in the morning and 66 taels in the afternoon.</p>

In the afternoon, it bought more than one thousand contracts and sold seven or eight hundred contracts. The Guangdong group advanced hundreds of contracts in the morning and sold two thousand contracts in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Resumes Its Sharp Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British and Indian Silver Markets Reported Lower Prices. The U.S. market was closed for the holiday, so there was no silver market telegraph and no exchange rate report. As for the Shanghai market, it was extremely charming. HSBC listed prices for each exchange rate, reducing them three times, totaling two and a half points. The British gold was reduced by 625, the US dollar by 1 yuan 25 cents, and the Japanese exchange rate increased by 8 cents. The reason was that the European market turned tight, and it was heard that the British Prime Minister reported on the silver shortage, which was feared to be difficult to remedy for a while. Furthermore, there are still many settlements. Jewish merchant Qiao Rifubu also settled British gold, so the market situation suddenly showed a peak. From the beginning, the British exchange rate was listed as reduced by 125, the US dollar by 25 cents, the Indian exchange rate by half a yuan, the German exchange rate by 1 yuan, the French exchange rate by 6 yuan, the Singapore exchange rate increased by one and a half taels, Hong Kong did not change, and Japanese gold increased by one and a half points.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Run Rampant</h3>
<p>Yarn Exchange to Suspend Trading Starting Tomorrow... Reopens on the 20th</p>
<p>The yarn market is very strong, and the trend of rising prices is becoming more acute, showing a sign of endless increases. This situation is completely driven by the cotton market, and fundamentally cannot be relaxed. Compared to the yarn price, it is cheaper, so there are many new bulls. Sellers are terrified, reaching an extreme point. However, a certain industrialist is still very interested because the exchange rate has shrunk again and raw materials have risen sharply. But some manufacturers have shorted a lot, but market sentiment is good, and there are many buyers. Some Japanese merchants have emptied out, so the rising trend is becoming more intense. The future still depends on the raw materials for advances and retreats.</p>
<p>Bidding is Consistently High. The bidding opened in the early market with the exchange rate shrinking again, the market sentiment was very tight, and there was a lack of sellers. Each month rose by six or seven qian to one tael, one, two, and qian. The situation was even sharper when the market opened in the afternoon. What was chosen tomorrow will be suspended, and business will resume as usual on the 20th. General retail investors had to painfully cut their positions due to insufficient strength, so the market sentiment became more intense. Each month rose by two taels one, two, qian to two taels five, six, eight, qian. The total transactions for the day were 15,900 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 3,650 bales, Dafu 1,600 bales, Minghua 1,100 bales, Dachangcheng 1,950 bales, and Changfeng 1,800 bales. Gongtai bought 2,700 bales, Yicheng 1,900 bales, Shenda 1,450 bales, and Yuda 1,000 bales. The closing price is listed on the left.</p>

Of the customer gangs, 360 bales were advanced inland, 55 bales in Guangdong, 10 bales in Sichuan, 65 bales in Tianjin, and 5 bales in Xuzhou.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Continues to Advance</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very strong, and the trend of rising prices is unstoppable. The panic of retail investors has reached its peak. This situation is due to the shrinking exchange rate, and the raw cotton offices of each factory are very diligent. The spot goods on the market are thin. The Japanese merchants have a large number of shortages. The outside air is becoming more tense. Because there is an unusual lack of sellers, and new buyers are becoming increasingly enthusiastic. Therefore, market prices are trending higher and higher. There is still a major change in the future situation.</p>
<p>The Han Standard Short Accounts Are Severely Injured. The Han Standard opened in the early market with rising gold prices and a shrinking exchange rate. There were very few sellers, and the situation suddenly became tight. Each month rose by five or eight qian. In the afternoon, retail investors heavily liquidated short positions, and the market rose by eight or nine qian. The total transactions for the day were 84,800 dan. It was found that Yichang sold 5,200 dan, Xincheng 3,800 dan, Deji 3,400 dan, Yuanda 3,900 dan, Rongxing 6,200 dan, and Guangdong 1,400 dan. Tian advanced 3,000 dan, and Shenda 7,000 dan.

<h3>Rice Market During the Food Conclusion Period</h3>
<p>Trading is Very Quiet... South Shanghai Has Stopped</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice situation in Zhabei showed a sign of decline. The source from all parties has been lacking, and buyers have little appetite because they have some storage on hand. Moreover, because of the continuous rainy weather, both parties have adopted a conclusion policy, so the trading was very quiet throughout the day. Only a few cargo ships that had not been settled the day before unloaded, so they could settle their accounts. In fact, there is no market situation. There are not many ships stored in the river at the moment, only dozens of them. Although there were extremely small transactions at noon, because the stop-hulling is approaching, there is not much in and out.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Shanghai Factory Exports to Europe are Still Stagnant</h3>
<p>Since the increase in the Shanghai Factory's Silk Market, as reported by European and American telegrams, the European merchants have continued to advance from Shanghai. However, because the cost of the B-grade factory is 1,270-80 taels, although the price from overseas has risen to 1,040-50 taels, the loss is still huge, and the willingness to sell is still weak. Yesterday, only Qianli and others advanced 60 bales of Shanghai White Factory Silk, and Dachang and others advanced 15 bales of Sichuan Yellow Factory Silk. Prices are firm.</p>
<h3>Seven Hundred Pieces of Shandong Silk Arrive</h3>

It was also found that there were those who wanted to estimate 118 taels. It is said that the Shaoxing gang has approved 350 futures contracts, and the Ningbo gangs</p>
<h3>Final Account Settlement Nears, Hardware Sales Clear Out</h3>
<p>As the final account settlement date approaches, all businesses, both local and foreign, are busy settling their accounts. Consequently, market trading has become noticeably quiet, and hardware sales have weakened as a result. Moreover, yesterday's continuous rain further dampened the market. Among the hardware, fancy goods saw a slight increase in sales, while staple goods, due to the rapid increase in standard prices, found few buyers. Yesterday, over six hundred barrels of cement were sold at a price of five taels and zero fen. White iron, red steel, foreign leather, new foreign silver dollars, angle iron, and tinplate were all sold in batches, but prices remained stable.</p>

<h3>The Anti-Opium Society Firmly Opposes Opium Public Sales</h3>
<p>Eight Proposals Passed</p>
<p>Determined to Oppose to the End</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, due to various rumors that the anti-smoking authorities are changing their policy of complete prohibition and adopting a plan for public sales of opium, and because the newly appointed anti-smoking commissioner Wu Liande has publicly advocated for public sales, and Li Jihong has gone to Taiwan to study public sales methods for emulation, believes that the matter is of extreme importance to the future of opium prohibition. Therefore, a temporary executive committee meeting was held yesterday morning at Mr. Tang Shaoyi's residence on Bazhi Road. Attendees included Honorary Chairman Tang Shaoyi, Chairman Wang Jingqi, Vice Chairman Li Denghui, legal advisor Cai Rudong, executive committee members Mrs. Bing Guoyou, Shen Gao, and Ding Shu, representatives from the Zhejiang branch, general manager Chen Lingyun, general manager of the society Huang Jiaohui, and secretary Chen Hongjun. Chairman Tang Shaoyi announced the purpose of the meeting, stating that the promotion of public opium sales has moved from theory to practical possibility, which he considers a very serious situation. He believes that the society should unite with various public organizations to oppose it, gather the opinions of the majority, and submit a petition to the government, requesting the strict implementation of opium prohibition and the establishment of more drug rehabilitation hospitals, ordering current opium addicts to quit within a specified time limit. The discussion of the proposals then began, resulting in the following resolutions: 1. To hold a joint meeting of Shanghai public organizations to oppose public opium sales on the afternoon of the 19th of this month at 3:30 PM, to arouse public attention. 2. To petition the central government to strictly prohibit opium and, based on Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug instructions, declare that opium will never be used as a source of revenue, and to immediately abolish the special opium tax in the two Hu provinces. 3. To petition the Legislative Yuan to immediately enact laws prohibiting the public sale of opium. 4. To petition the Central Party Headquarters to publicize and prevent public sales based on Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug instructions. 5. To send letters to Commissioners Zhong Ke and Ma Yinchu, urging them to strongly oppose public opium sales to the authorities. 6. To send a letter of advice to the Central Anti-Opium Committee. 7. The case of whether executive committee members of this society should be allowed to concurrently serve as members of the Central Anti-Opium Committee will be submitted to the general assembly for a vote. 8. To issue a declaration opposing public opium sales and state that Wu Liande's proposal for public sales is his personal action and completely contradicts the overall position of this society. All of the above proposals were passed and handed over to the secretariat for active implementation, in order to emphasize opium prohibition and benefit anti-drug efforts.</p>
<h3>Severe Penalties for Absentees from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week</h3>
<p>The City Executive Committee Formulates Five Measures</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters holds a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week every Monday morning at 9:00 AM. In addition to reporting on the work of the past week, committee members rotate weekly to lecture on Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and a staff member is selected by lottery to present a prepared speech on Sun Yat-sen's teachings. This practice has been very successful. Recently, five disciplinary measures for absenteeism have been stipulated as follows: (1) Any person absent three times within two months will be dismissed from their position. (2) Two requests for leave within one month will be counted as one absence. (3) Staff members requesting extended leave must state their reasons, and the training department will submit the request to the executive committee for a decision. (4) Staff members on official duty will not be considered as having requested leave or being absent. (5) Staff members selected to speak who fail to do so will be considered absent. It is reported that the above measures were approved at the 87th executive committee meeting the day before yesterday and have been communicated to all departments for the information of their respective staff members.</p>

Chen then proceeded with the handover formalities. It is said that he officially took office today, without any ceremony. There will be no inauguration ceremony. The internal personnel of the bureau will remain unchanged.</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi Discusses the Twenty Academic Expedition</h3>
<p>Detailed Account of the Sino-French Itinerary</p>
<p>Developing Resources Begins in the Northwest</p>
<p>Yesterday, newspapers in Beijing reported on the news of a "French Kangzang Expedition," which does not entirely correspond to the facts. Knowing that Chinese Committee Member Chu Minyi was the leader of the Chinese side of the expedition, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited his residence to inquire about the truth. Mr. Chu gave a very detailed reply, which is recorded below. Chu said that previously, Sino-French academic organizations formed an organization called the Nineteen Academic Expedition, which was based on sixteen articles of cooperation between Mr. Li Shizeng, representing the Chinese Academic Organizations Association, and the Citroen Automobile Company and Mr. Yu An, representing the French government. Each side appointed a leader. The Chinese side was led by himself, and the French side was led by a man named Haardt. The articles of cooperation stated that each side would appoint a number of members to form the expedition. French members must be reviewed and appointed by the academic organizations association of their country. The route was as follows: the French side would use seven Citroen-Kégresse vehicles, departing from Europe, passing through Asia Minor, Turkishistan, and arriving in Yining, Xinjiang. The Chinese side would also use Citroen-Kégresse vehicles shipped from France, departing from Tianjin, passing through Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Lanzhou, and arriving in Dihua. Then they would meet with the French members. Because the borders of Xinjiang have many high mountains and steep ridges, Citroen-Kégresse vehicles are not easy to pass through, so the French had to abandon their vehicles and walk across the border of Xinjiang, then switch to vehicles departing from Tianjin and return to Beijing, then turn around and travel along the Hankou Road to Hankou, then along the Yuehan Road to Longzhou, and then to Annam. At this point, the Chinese side of the expedition came to an end. The French side would continue to advance, from Annam to India, and back to Europe. The time spent in China was only five months, just passing through, and there was no time to collect antiquities. The Chinese side took this opportunity to use Citroen-Kégresse vehicles to inspect the northwest, which would surely yield results. It can be predicted that the development of resources in the northwest in the future will begin with this expedition. He recalled that he had inspected the Suiyuan and Zhangjiakou areas the year before last and knew that China's resources were in the northwest. If the northwest is not developed, China will remain poor and weak for a long time. If efforts are made to develop it, it will surely become rich and strong. Therefore, he said that the future of Chinese industry today is like that of the United States in the past, and it should start with efforts to develop the west. The reason why the expedition did not take place last year was that both sides were not prepared, and he had to go to Belgium to participate in the World's Fair. The expedition has now been renamed the Twenty Academic Expedition. Both sides are prepared and the departure date should not be far off.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cotton Production Improvement Statistics Conference</h3>
<p>Jointly Initiated by the National Cotton Industry</p>
<p>Conference to Be Held for One Week Starting March 15th</p>
<p>Since 1919, the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association has been engaged in domestic cotton production surveys, spanning a decade. Limited by financial resources, progress has been slow. Currently, this survey has been generously supported by provincial cotton fields and major cotton industry organizations in various cotton-producing provinces, who have provided personnel to assist. In terms of survey personnel, it has reached perfection. Considering that improvements are needed in terms of economics and organization, and that surveys in previous years have been too late and of little use, it is urgent to change to estimation methods to meet needs. Initially, it was planned to invite cotton fields from various provinces currently engaged in cotton production surveys to hold a cotton production statistics conference to discuss estimation methods suitable for the whole country. Later, the attendees were all provincial cotton fields, and the majority opinion was to take this opportunity to add the issue of cotton production improvement to the discussion. Therefore, the scope of the meeting was slightly expanded and renamed the Chinese Cotton Production Improvement Statistics Conference. Currently, Jiang Dixian of the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association, Yang Xiandong of the Hubei Cotton Crop Improvement Committee, and Wu Weijing of the Zhejiang Provincial Cotton Industry Improvement Field are responsible for the preparations. The details of the conference are as follows: (A) Initiators: Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Industry Improvement Committee, Shandong Provincial Cotton Industry Experimental Station, Henan University Agricultural Extension Department, Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Cotton Experimental Field, Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Cotton Experimental Field, Hebei Industrial Department Zhengding Cotton Industry Experimental Field, Hunan Provincial Cotton Industry Experimental Station, Anhui Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station, and this association. The initiators are the provincial agricultural fields, cotton fields, or cotton industry organizations currently engaged in cotton production statistics. Other cotton planting and cotton industry organizations will be invited to attend for guidance. (B) Objectives: (1) To connect the provincial cotton fields, agricultural fields, cotton planting organizations, and domestic cotton planting industry engaged in cotton planting in various provinces, and to jointly discuss the overall improvement strategy of national cotton production. (2) To determine the cotton production statistics and estimation methods applicable to the whole country. (C) Conference period: The opening ceremony will be held at 2:00 PM on March 15th and the closing ceremony will be held on the afternoon of March 21st, a total of one week, with one meeting in the morning and afternoon each day. (D) Reports and speeches: Representatives from various provinces will report on (1) the current situation of cotton crops, (2) past improvements, and (3) future plans. Domestic cotton industry experts will be invited to give speeches, with topics divided into four categories: (1) breeding, (2) promotion, (3) statistics and estimation, and (4) others (trade, fiber engineering, etc.). It is planned to invite twelve lecturers to give one speech in the morning and afternoon each day. (E) Proposals: In addition to proposals from the initiators, proposals on "improvement" or "statistics" from the domestic cotton industry are extremely welcome. Please send them to the meeting early. (F) Address: Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association, 86 Edward Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>National Products Association Reports on the Progress of the Southeast Asia Inspection Team</h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome from Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Association telegraphed the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating that the Southeast Asian Islands inspection team organized by the association had already submitted the team members' resumes to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce when they departed on November 8th last year. The team members returned to Shanghai on February 2nd of this year. They reported that they were warmly welcomed by our consulates and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Saigon, Cochinchina, Singapore, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, Penang, Bangkok, Medan, Batavia, and other ports. From Saigon to Singapore, the local Republican Daily even hailed the team as the first pioneers of the Chinese Southeast Asian market, placing the fifteen-character title in the news column in large font. This shows the importance that all parties attached to the team. Team leader Zhou Guojun is still in Shantou, inspecting commerce and has not returned. Detailed information will be reported when Team Leader Zhou returns to China next month. The dates of arrival of the team members in Shanghai will be telegraphed to your ministry for verification and record.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Silk Mill Shutdowns</h3>
<p>Financial Difficulties, Cocoon Shortages, Taking a Short Break</p>
<p>After the New Year, silk mills in this city borrowed money from the financial community to start work due to a slight increase in silk sales in Europe and America. However, this was just a flash in the pan, and European and American silk sales declined again, with silk prices plummeting by more than 100 taels. Although prices have risen by 20 to 30 taels due to exchange rate fluctuations, the shortage of cocoons and high prices have made it difficult to cover costs. It is difficult to sell at a loss. In addition, the accounting period of the silver and money markets has arrived, and the repayment of silk cocoon mortgages is very urgent. The government's assistance to the silk industry and the issuance of public bonds will take time. Unable to sustain operations, most of the more than 40 silk mills that had started work took advantage of the annual closure and announced shutdowns yesterday.</p>
<h3>Managers of Various Bookstores Spoke at the Municipal Propaganda Department the Other Day</h3>
<p>Handling of Reactionary Publications</p>
<p>Report from the Municipal Propaganda Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters Propaganda Department has always paid close attention to cultural institutions in this city. Recently, it planned to separately convene representatives of various cultural institutions to discuss and negotiate everything. On the afternoon of the 12th (the day before yesterday) at 3:00 PM, managers of bookstores in this city were convened for a discussion. Representatives from the New Life, New Universe, Qingyun, Yonghu, Qunzhong, Huatong, World, United, Modern, Taidong, Guanghua, Yadong, Kaiming, Commercial Press, Beixin, Zhonghua, New Moon, Dadong, Dajiang, Guangming, Literary, Qun, and Nanqiang bookstores, totaling more than 30 people, attended. Cai Hongtian, Zhou Hanmei, Li Zheng, Cai Bubai, and others from the Municipal Propaganda Department attended. Cai Hongtian, Secretary of the Propaganda Department, chaired the meeting, and Chen Ming recorded the minutes. At the beginning of the meeting, after the ceremonial greetings, the chairman reported, stating that Shanghai is the center of the publishing industry in China, and the representatives of the more than 30 bookstores present today are the focus. Therefore, the significance of today's discussion is very important. If the publishing industry in Shanghai can embark on an accurate path, it will not only guarantee the peace of mind of the ideological circles and society in this city, but also clarify the ideology of the whole country. Since 1915, the ideological circles in China have seemed to have a vigorous new atmosphere, but who knows that this has been exploited by the most reactionary factions, leading to bizarre and extremely chaotic situations. Therefore, the Party has had to ban reactionary publications. It should be known that this kind of ban is not done willingly. However, a small number of people in society are unaware of this and believe that freedom of speech and publication is enshrined in the Party's program, so the current ban is self-contradictory. It should be known that freedom is not without restrictions. If freedom is excessive, it is a crime. Otherwise, adultery, robbery, and arson would be freedom. This kind of freedom will surely lead to national destruction. This is not just the case in China. Governments around the world prohibit the publication of dangerous books, or revise them. Within Soviet Russia, the existence of even one book of the Three Principles of the People is absolutely prohibited. Therefore, banning reactionary publications is not reprehensible and cannot be reprehended. However, most bookstores in this city are commercial in nature. Publishing reactionary publications is not due to a political background or political activities, but is the result of competing for novelty and being manipulated by reactionary female thieves in the literary world. Therefore, the Municipal Propaganda Department is deeply concerned about the losses of bookstores on the road to prohibition, and that is why today's discussion is being held to negotiate with each other to make up for the losses. Today, two issues that are hoped to be discussed are: (1) Banned books should be burned immediately. (2) In the future, it is best to submit books for review to this department in advance to avoid unexpected losses after printing. Next, Zhou Hanmei of the Guidance Section and Li Zheng of the Editorial Section gave reports successively. Then, representatives of various bookstores expressed their opinions and jointly discussed the methods, scope, and standards of reviewing manuscripts. It is reported that satisfactory results were achieved.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Registration Extended to the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Due to Incomplete Procedures for a Few Small Newspapers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters Propaganda Department is handling the registration of all major and minor newspapers and news agencies in the city. The deadline was the 12th of this month. The department was going to stop registration, but there are still a few small newspapers that have not completed the registration procedures. Therefore, the deadline has been extended to the end of this month. After the deadline, there will be no exceptions.</p>
<h3>Question of Establishing a Maritime Administration Bureau</h3>
<p>Shipping Companies Have Not Expressed Support or Opposition</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that China's maritime administrative power is controlled by the Marine Department of the Customs, which seriously affects China's sovereign right to communications. It has proposed to the National Government to define the scope of powers and establish maritime administration bureaus in Shanghai and other places to manage all maritime affairs. The State Council has formally approved this. This city is also one of the places where a bureau will be established. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency inquired with shipping companies yesterday and recorded the situation as follows: Organization of the Maritime Administration Bureau: This matter has been noisy for a long time, for more than two years. It is intended to establish a general bureau in Shanghai, with the following branches: (1) Nanjing (also in charge of Pukou), (2) Zhenjiang (also in charge of Tongyang and Huaiyun), (3) Suzhou (also in charge of Suxi), (4) Haizhou, (5) Hangzhou (also in charge of Jiahu and Zhejiang), (6) Ningbo (also in charge of Zhenhai and Zhoushan), (7) Wenzhou (also in charge of Oujiang and Taijiang), etc. Yang Ying (Zixiong), the current acting principal of the Wusong Merchant Marine School, was appointed as the director of the Shanghai bureau. The bureau was located on the fourth floor of 6 Huangpu Beach. However, due to various procedures, it could not be formally established. On February 3rd of this year, the State Council discussed it again, and the result was to revise the established places to (1) Shanghai (also in charge of Jiang, Zhejiang, and Anhui ports), (2) Hankou (also in charge of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Sichuan ports), (3) Weihaiwei (also in charge of Zhili, Shandong, Liaoning, and coastal ports), (4) Harbin (also in charge of Songjiang and Heilongjiang ports), (5) Hong Kong (also in charge of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces). The Ministry has followed the order of the Executive Yuan to implement it.</p>
<p>The Shipping Association's View: Shipping companies generally welcome the government's intention to use this to recover maritime rights. Former Director Yang Zixiong, believing that the government has re-proposed the matter, is eager to establish the Maritime Administration Bureau. A few days ago, he specially visited the leader of the shipping industry, Yu Qiaqing, to ask for his support. Yu replied that the matter concerned the entire shipping industry and would be submitted for discussion at the meeting. At the general meeting of the Shipping Association the previous week, no decision was made on this issue, and neither support nor opposition was expressed. After hearing this news, Director Yang went to Nanjing to ask the government for instructions. He is expected to return to Shanghai in the next few days. According to reliable sources yesterday, the Executive Yuan believes that although the establishment of the Maritime Administration Bureau has been decided by the government, the consent of the Shanghai shipping companies must be obtained beforehand before it can be formally organized. As such, the matter has been noisy for a long time, and the date of its establishment is still far away.</p>
<h3>Joint Business Effort to Study Business Tax</h3>
<p>Various Trade Associations Present Opinions</p>
<p>Two Research Associations Seek Mutual Verification</p>
<p>The Guomin News reports that since the National Government officially ordered the abolition of the Likin tax and implemented the collection of business tax, businesspeople across the country have paid close attention to it. The business community in this city is even more enthusiastic, with various trade associations organizing tax rule research committees and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce establishing business tax research committees. Although seemingly self-organized, their research targets are the same. The two associations plan to exchange and verify their research results to gather a wide range of opinions and achieve consensus. The following are excerpts of telegrams from various parties: (1) The various trade tax rule research committees to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce business tax committee: Respected Sirs, It is our considered opinion that imperfect national systems are directly sufficient to stifle production development and indirectly sufficient to hinder national prosperity. Therefore, tax rules in democratic countries must be passed by people's representative bodies to ensure that they align with the principle of people's livelihood. Our country, however, has just celebrated unification, and the period of political tutelage is just beginning, with formal representative bodies of the people yet to be legally established. The government authorities have declared that they are extremely willing to listen to public opinion when formulating new taxes. Therefore, the various trade associations, recognizing the importance of tax rules, and to embody the sincerity of the wise authorities, in order to thoroughly complete tariff autonomy and promote the implementation of new taxes, have dispatched personnel to organize our association, whose duty is to study the perfection of the tax system and assist the government authorities where they fall short. Your organization has led the city's business community and your past suggestions on tax matters have always been insightful. This time, you have paid particular attention to the business tax in this city, organizing a specialized committee to conduct research. Moreover, the committee members are all outstanding individuals and respected figures in the business community, who will undoubtedly benefit the party, the country, and the business community in the future. Our associations are intrinsically linked, with common interests and should work together. We are sending this letter to inform you that if you have any opinions in the future, please notify this association in time so that we can exchange research and consult with the authorities for adoption, so that the opinions of the business community can be expressed in a unified manner, etc. Your profound insights are deeply appreciated. We hope that you will forward this to the members of the business tax research committee of your association, so that they may promote progress and explore verification at any time. Then, the national tax system will truly rely on progress, and not only will the various industries benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. (1) The Luodian Chamber of Commerce of Baoshan County to the Tax Rule Research Organization (details omitted): We hereby request that you relay the opinions of the merchants as follows: (1) All businesses operating within the territory should be taxed uniformly. Merchants' businesses vary in size and are based on goods. Some goods are manufactured, some are wholesaled, and some are retailed. Now, the tax rate is set such that manufacturing has a manufacturing tax, wholesaling has a wholesaling tax, and retailing has a retailing tax. Most of the goods in rural stores are purchased in bulk. If they are taxed as business tax, it is actually a third layer of taxation. (2) If business tax is already collected by the central government, should special taxes, such as tobacco and alcohol taxes, be collected as before? In rural towns, shops that sell oil also sell alcohol, and shops that sell paper also sell tobacco. The daily income cannot be divided into separate accounts for oil, alcohol, paper, and tobacco, to be cleared one by one. How should taxes be handled at the time of payment? (3) Taxes are paid monthly, and tax collectors can check their account books. Those with false accounts will be fined. Merchants' account books cannot be separated from the store for a day. If officials pick faults and harass them, there is no shortage of excuses to impose guilt. They will take away the account books and force them to pay fines, leading to endless troubles, even worse than the old likin system. The above points have all been reported by the stores in the city. Although they may be overly cautious, the matter is indeed inevitable. We should request your association to consider how to further address the government. If you can turn it into public opinion, we would be grateful (details omitted). (1) The Egg Industry Association of this city to the Tax Rule Research Organization: It is our understanding that eggs are a secondary product of farmers and a necessity for consumption, and should not be regarded as a luxury business. Moreover, the egg business has the greatest risks, the most losses, and the lowest profits. It is frequently subjected to foreign suppression, and most businesses already find it difficult to support themselves. If they are subjected to heavy taxes, regardless of their short lifespan, since the government takes business as the standard, without regard to profit or loss, uniform taxation will occur. At this time of egg industry decline, after the abolition of likin, with the industry barely recovering, how can it withstand heavy taxation again? We should request that a telegram be sent to the Executive Yuan, imploring it to consider the great importance of the egg industry to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and approve the lowest possible tax rate. Furthermore, the egg industry in this city mostly purchases goods from the interior, only buying and not selling. We have heard that egg farms in the interior will also be required to register and pay taxes. When shipping out, those with customs will report export tax, and those without customs will remit and pay import tax. In the future, when resold overseas, export tax will also be required. After the business tax is levied in the three cities, taxes will also have to be paid. This is one item taxed four times. We do not know if this conflicts with the regulations. If it does, we especially request your association to represent the heavy taxation, as egg merchants cannot afford it. Please approve the lowest possible tax rate for the egg business. Also, the business tax issue in Shanghai should still proceed according to the steps decided at the second representative conference. When it is necessary to hold it, all Chinese and foreign stores should be treated equally to show fairness. In addition, this city has not suffered losses from the abolition of likin, and it seems that it should follow the provisions of Article 4 of the regulations, requesting a rate that should not exceed two per thousand and should be appropriately reduced to ease the burden on the business community (details omitted). (1) The New Medicine Industry Association of this city to the Tax Rule Research Organization: We have read the regulations for the collection of business tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the tax rate for Western medicine is as high as 20 per thousand, and 15 per thousand. We are shocked. Medicine is for treating diseases and is of great importance to people's lives. It is by no means comparable to luxury goods. The tax rate set by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for medicinal materials is 2 per thousand. Why is there such discrimination for the same medicine? If we do not strive for it, we fear that the Shanghai Municipal Government will also want to use this as a ratio when formulating the business tax to be collected in the future. Our association will not recognize it. We are sending this letter to request your association to uphold justice and quickly send a telegram to the People's Government and the Executive Yuan to instruct the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to correct it in order to alleviate the difficulties of the business community and maintain the lives of the people (details omitted).</p>
<h3>Tea Association Requests Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>A Document Submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Nanshi Tea Trade Association convened an executive committee to study the business tax. Mr. Yang Shangting chaired the meeting, stating that if the business tax rate is collected at 5 per thousand, the industry will not be able to withstand it. It was decided to submit a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the financial authorities, requesting that it not exceed 2 per thousand in accordance with the regulations. The document submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday stated that it was a request for a reduction in the business tax rate in order to maintain national production and benefit the business community. Our association has received reports from member companies stating that the business tax for tea shops in Shanghai is to be levied at 5 per thousand. In recent years, sales of Chinese tea have greatly decreased, and the tea industry has reached its limit. If this large amount of business tax is levied again, it will directly put domestic production in a desperate situation. The tea production volume is mainly from Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, Fujian, Jiangxi and other provinces. Taking Zhejiang Province as an example, when rural farmers pick tea leaves in the spring and summer, they sell them to the nearby temporary tea shops, which must be subject to a business tax once. Then, the tea shops in the rural towns sell them to the large tea shops in the provincial capitals or urban areas, which must be subject to business tax again. Then, they are resold to the tea shops in Shanghai, which must also be taxed. When the Shanghai tea shops resell them to tea shops, they must also be taxed. The goods from the place of origin to the tea shops are already taxed four times. However, the abolition of Likin and the increase in taxes is a good intention to consolidate and alleviate the difficulties of the business community. Now, there is a proposal to collect 5 per thousand, which violates the regulations. It is stipulated in Article 4 of the provinces taxation regulations that where luxury goods and items with a need to be banned are concerned, this would not be the case. It can be seen that the government's intention is to prevent taxation from being unrestricted everywhere, which would harm businesses instead of benefiting them. This is why there are such strict regulations. Even Dr. Ma Yinchu, a member of the Legislative Yuan, stated during a speech at the Municipal Party Headquarters on the business tax rate, "The business tax levied on capital should not exceed 10 per thousand, and the business tax levied on business should not exceed 2 per thousand." His statement was also based on the regulations. Now, because our members cannot afford this large amount of business tax, they unanimously request that your association forward this to the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Government to handle it in accordance with the regulations. Please do not exceed 2 per thousand for the business tax of our industry in order to maintain national production and benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Industry Willing to Back the Tianjin Association</h3>
<p>Repercussions from the Tianjin Bureau's Excessive Tax Collection</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Industry Association received a telegram from the Tianjin Meida Cigarette Company, stating that Luo Chengwei, Director of the Hebei Cigarette Unified Tax Bureau, together with Song Manshan, who purchased them, and Liu Yusheng, the investigation director, colluded to engage in corruption and arbitrarily overcharged. For all Chinese cigarettes transported from Tianjin to the provinces of Rehe, Chahar, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, an additional eight or nine yuan or more was extorted after clearing the unified tax, otherwise they would not be allowed to pass. Our company has been overcharged a huge amount of 958 yuan. However, they do not dare to touch the goods of foreign merchants. This invisibly increases the cost of Chinese cigarettes by eight or nine yuan, and the value of foreign goods is already balanced. Their harm to national goods and violation of laws and discipline are unprecedented. In addition to submitting reports to various constitutions for strict investigation and handling, and requesting the Hebei Local Court Procuratorate to file a public prosecution and punish them according to the law, this is specially reported by telegram. We hope you will publish it and provide guidance. Enclosed is a copy of the indictment and declaration filed with the Hebei Local Court Procuratorate. We have heard that the members of the association were extremely indignant upon hearing the news, as it concerned the industry, and immediately telegraphed the Tianjin Association to request confirmation, preparing to seriously negotiate based on the facts. Here is the telegram sent to the Tianjin Association: To Chairman Wang of the Tianjin Cigarette Association, Mr. Liu Lanpo, upon reading your letter, we are aware of the illegal overcharges by the Hebei Bureau. Please provide definite evidence, and our association is willing to back you up and negotiate with the tax authority. Shanghai Association Sincerely.</p>
<h3>Store Employees' Salaries Calculated Monthly According to the National Calendar</h3>
<p>No Need to Provide Supplementary Compensation Due to Discrepancies from the Lunar Calendar</p>
<p>Since the National Government officially ordered the implementation of the National Calendar, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association, because of the difference in the number of days in the National Calendar year and the Lunar Calendar year, the general pharmaceutical workers took this opportunity to request that the employers make up for the wage difference, so they sent representatives such as Sun Meitang to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting instructions on whether to compensate for the wage difference. Yesterday, we received a response from the bureau, which stated: "We have received your request. The payment of wages to employees in the industry has always been calculated on a monthly basis. Now that the National Calendar is being implemented, it is appropriate to calculate it according to the months of the National Calendar. Please inform them accordingly. This concludes the response.</p>
<h3>Rental Housing in the City Center</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works Seeks Design Plans</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government delineated the city center area, it has spared no effort in planning and management. All matters concerning the road system and zoning plans in the area have been announced successively, as reported in previous newspapers. We have recently heard that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, considering the city center area to be a rare piece of land in the city, requires all buildings to strive for perfection. Now that the new municipal government building has been scheduled for the groundbreaking ceremony on July 7th of this year, the rental housing in the commercial and residential areas will inevitably be built in time. If there are no standard drawings for reference, it will be difficult to design and arrange them properly. With the approval of the municipal government, it has decided to first solicit standard design plans for reference by investors and builders. The first prize winner can receive a prize of 1,000 yuan, and the second and third place winners will receive different prizes. We have found the origin and solicitation methods and are eager to disclose them as follows:</p>
<p>Origins of the Solicitation: In recent years, land prices in this city have been increasing, and construction materials and labor costs have been rising. Investors and builders of rental housing often focus on short-term interests and pay no attention to the safety and comfort of tenants. Therefore, most of the houses built are simple and outdated, not meeting the needs of the times. The building regulations can only correct the overall structure of the upper course. As for whether the width and depth of the house are appropriate, whether the interior layout is suitable, and whether the exterior of the building is as good as it should be, we still have to seek active improvements in addition to passive restrictions. In view of this, the bureau held a solicitation for standard design plans for rental housing in the city in 1928. At that time, domestic architectural experts enthusiastically responded, and the bureau evaluated and published a special book. The progress of the construction of rental housing in the city in the past two years has been greatly assisted by the guidance of these standard design plans. Now that the urban center area has been determined, and the road system and zoning plans in the area have been announced successively, the construction of housing in the commercial and residential areas as needed will be carried out one after another. However, the city center area is observed by the entire city, and no matter what kind of building, if it is not carefully designed and arranged by architectural experts, it will not be a model. Therefore, we are holding a second solicitation for prize money, with April 15, 1931, as the deadline. We hope that domestic architectural experts will be enthusiastic about municipal administration, express their talents, and not be stingy with their pearls.</p>
<p>Solicitation Methods: (1) Scope of Solicitation: A section of urban housing in the commercial area of the city center area and its entire layout, a section of housing in the residential area of the city center area and its entire layout.

(A) Style: The exterior of the house should be generous and beautiful, and should preserve the oriental style. However, the old-fashioned shikumen often gives residents a sense of depression and must be avoided.

(C) Building Area: The building area in the residential area should not exceed 40% of the total area, and the commercial area should not exceed 60%.

Each residence should be designed for one family, with at least one bedroom, one living room, one dining room, one kitchen, one servant's room, one storage room, one toilet, one bathroom, and one clothes drying area. Assuming that there are no complete ditches around this section, attention should be paid to the equipment for accommodating sewage near the city houses or residences.

(E) All texts in the drawings, except for numbers, should be written in Chinese, and the dimensions should be in metric units. (5) Prizes: The first prize is 1,000 gold yuan, the second prize is 500 yuan, and the third prize is 200 yuan. If only one of the two designs is selected, half of the prize money will be awarded. (6) Notice: The solicitation methods and maps can be obtained from the Fourth Section of the Bureau of Public Works, Maojia Lane, Nanshi, Shanghai. Applicants who have any questions about the solicitation methods can send an anonymous letter to the bureau for inquiry. The bureau will immediately copy the original letter, together with the reply, and send it to each applicant. However, if there are any letters after March 21, 1931, they will not be answered. (7) Secret Marks: Do not write your name on the design drawings, just make a secret mark in the lower right corner of the drawing paper, and write your name, experience, place of work, and the secret mark used on the design drawings on another piece of paper, seal it in an opaque envelope, and submit it with the drawings. This letter will be opened by the judges after the designs have been evaluated. (8) Evaluation: The evaluation of the designs will be handled by a committee organized by experts. After the evaluation, the winners will be notified by the bureau and announced in major newspapers in this city. (9) Sending Designs: The designs must be properly sealed and sent by registered mail or delivered to the Fourth Section of the Bureau of Public Works, Maojia Lane, Nanshi, Shanghai, for a receipt.

<h3>Merchant Inland River Vessels Also Suspend Service</h3>
<p>No Goods or Passengers on Any Routes</p>
<p>Forced to Stop Sailing</p>
<p>Since Shi Zhaoji took over the Merchants' Inland River Steamship Bureau, he has implemented austerity policies. The Zhejiang Construction Department has remitted more than 10,000 yuan in cash to support the reorganization of various routes. The small inland river steamers in Shanghai have been suspended since the 11th. The bureau is a government-run agency, and Shi Zhaoji decided to operate as usual. However, since the 12th, the steamers on the Suzhou and Hangzhou routes have been departing with no goods to load and no passengers traveling, and he would be wasting fuel, which would not benefit the bureau. Considering the economic situation, he telegraphed Hangzhou to request permission to suspend service. The reply was received yesterday, and the bureau's steamers on the Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Huzhou routes will also be suspended and will not depart until the 23rd.</p>

<h3>Measures for Transporting Rice to Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Traffic Departments require that rice transported to Zhejiang must be inspected by the Rice Inspection Office before it can be released. Now that the agency has been abolished, special temporary measures for transporting rice have been established. Yesterday, all station masters were instructed to follow them. One of the measures is listed below: (1) For foreign rice declared in Shanghai, the customs declaration form should be checked before it can be loaded. (2) If the rice is in transit from Jiangsu Province to Zhejiang Province, the passport should be checked. (3) If there is no customs declaration form or passport, the forwarding station master should ask the cargo owner or the forwarding company to issue a temporary bond, stating that the cargo owner is responsible for any accidents or detentions by the state agency.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Northeast Special Envoy Departs</h3>
<p>Li Zhenbang to Depart North Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society has learned that various places in the three northeastern provinces have been using the name of the Red Cross to take actions outside of established procedures. The vast distances make inspections difficult, and it is difficult to distinguish between good and bad, which has a great impact. As a result, the work of the various branches is also difficult to progress. Therefore, honorary public relations officer Li Zhenbang has been appointed as the Northeast inspector to guide the branches to work hard and reorganize everything in order to achieve unified national development. He is scheduled to depart by ship tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Joint Conference of National Medical Associations</h3>
<p>Discusses the Registration of Doctors in the French Concession</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Medical Association convened various medical associations at Yizhixiang to discuss all important issues. Representatives from the National Medical Association, Xu Naili and Wang Wanbai, representatives from the Chinese Medical Association, Niu Huisheng, Chu Minyi, Le Wenzhao, and Zhu Hengbi, representatives from the Pharmaceutical Association of the Republic of China, Xia Dongchu, Zhu Qiluo, and Liu Buqing, representatives from the Shanghai Medical Association, Song Guobin and Ye Zhisheng, secretary Zhu Shansong, representatives from the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, Fang Jiacheng, Cao Fangtao, Wang Shushu, and Ni Liansheng, and representatives from the Shanghai Branch of the Pharmaceutical Association of the Republic of China, Cai Yumen, and others, more than a dozen people were present. Song Guobin was elected as the chairman. First, Chu Minyi and Niu Huisheng reported on the process of contacting the Bureau of Health regarding the registration issue in the French Concession. The result was very satisfactory. Three methods were discussed on the spot, requesting the Bureau of Health to adopt public opinion and strive for the right: (1) The organizational law of the Ministry of Health has not yet been promulgated, and the registration in the French Concession cannot be delayed. Therefore, it is proposed that all members of formal medical organizations who have proof can obtain a temporary certificate from the Bureau to open a clinic in the French Concession and register directly. (2) According to the French Concession's regulations for the registration of doctors, doctors residing outside the French Concession who want to see patients in the Concession must first obtain a license. Because these methods are close to harshness, it should be requested that the Bureau protest that physicians whose professions have been approved by the National Government do not need to obtain a license in each concession. (3) The French Concession's regulations for the registration of doctors state that a fee of 2 yuan must be charged annually for obtaining a license. The means is complicated and should be handled according to the regulations of the National Government and to levy a permanent payment one time. The above three articles were unanimously approved and the matter was proposed by Wang Wanbai. Then, the examination regulations for Western medicine physicians published by the Examination Yuan were discussed, and it was decided that opposition to the examination methods in the regulations should be expressed. The matter was handed over to the medical associations to convene meetings separately, discuss in detail, and then decide. Song also discussed other cases and adjourned.</p>
<h3>Total Number of Death Sentences in the Public Concession Last Year</h3>
<p>Total of Forty-Four People</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that a total of 44 criminals in the Public Concession were sentenced to death by the court last year. Of these, 42 were sent to the Junhe River in Jing for execution by shooting in accordance with the Law on Punishing Bandits, and the remaining two were convicted of murder and sentenced to hanging in accordance with the criminal law. But that is a significant decrease compared to the previous year, when a total of 77 criminals were sentenced to death in 1929, including one woman who was sentenced to hanging for conspiring with her lover to kill her husband.</p>
<h3>Telegram Regarding the Disastrous Military Calamity in Zheng County</h3>
<p>Telegram Received by the Red Cross from the Henan Relief Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from the Henan Relief Association, which reads: "To the esteemed Chinese Red Cross Society, according to a report from Xie Zechao, the Magistrate of Zheng County, since April, rebel troops have been entrenched in the county, dispatching over 4,000 soldiers in total. Airstrikes have destroyed over 280 houses, and there have been losses of over 2,300 large and small carts, and over 32,100 livestock. Over 1.34 million catties of rice straw and over 53,000 stones of rice were requisitioned, along with donations and requisition fees totaling over 710,000 yuan. Losses from wartime labor, damaged crops, and plundered clothing are valued at over 360,000 yuan, bringing the total estimated losses to over 4.16 million yuan in silver. These figures are verifiable. Other losses are not included. Currently, the affected people lack food and clothing, and are suffering amid the cold weather at the end of the year. We earnestly request your immediate transfer to relief efforts." It is noted that Zheng County is the center of the Pinghan Railway and a strategic location where the rebel forces congregate. The situation is dire and support is urgently needed. The rebel troops have directly seized everything possible, leaving the populace with no means of livelihood. After the looting, the remaining people are left waiting for death. We earnestly hope for swift relief efforts. [Signed] Zhang Fang, Henan Relief Association.</p>

<h3>Grain Merchant He Jiechun Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Dragged from Rickshaw and Taken Away in a Car</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Puller Exhausted and Unable to Give Chase</p>
<p>He Jiechun, a grain merchant employed at Tongxingtai Firm at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Fuzhou Road, residing at 231 1/2 Xixinglong Lane, Chongqing Road, was abducted at approximately 11 PM the night before last. He was riding home from work in his private rickshaw when, upon reaching the lane entrance, he was suddenly kidnapped by four men. Yesterday morning, the victim's family reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station, requesting an investigation. As of yet, there are no leads. He Jiechun is a local, 45 years old, who has been in the grain business, also dealing in exports. He uses a rickshaw for his daily commute. On Thursday night, he visited a friend at the Far East Hotel regarding business matters, not returning home until after 11 PM. As the rickshaw approached the entrance of Xixinglong Lane, two men suddenly approached in the rain, behaving suspiciously. The first man walked to the front of the rickshaw and, without asking any questions, grabbed the rickshaw puller, Ah Er, by the chest, loudly asking the person behind him, "Is this him?" The man replied yes. At this point, He Jiechun, bewildered, peered out of the rickshaw canopy to see what was happening. To his surprise, the two men in front had already started tearing the canopy apart. They took a step forward and, with four hands, pulled He Jiechun out, exclaiming "Get in the car!" They led him to a car with guns and forced him inside. The car immediately started and headed south. The rickshaw puller, Ah Er, initially filled with righteous indignation, took off in pursuit. The kidnappers' car turned south and then east, entering the British Concession via Manila Road and then the French Concession via Danshui Road, eventually disappearing on Route des Soeurs. By this point, Ah Er was exhausted and out of breath, left with nothing to do but return in despair, report to the victim's wife, and then report to the police station. According to the rickshaw puller, the car's license plate appeared to be a black plate number 403, but after investigation, the police suspect that this is a forgery.</p>
<h3>Four Corpses Dug Out of the Fire Site on Baotong Road</h3>
<p>A Mother Firmly Embraced Her Son, Their Bodies Completely Charred</p>
<p>Two Apprentices Unable to Escape, Losing Their Lives</p>
<p>The fire at the Gui Xiang Cun cigarette paper and sundry goods store at 452 Baotong Road, Zhabei, at 11:30 PM the night before last, which consumed five buildings, was reported in yesterday's paper. When the fire broke out, firefighters were busy extinguishing the blaze and could not immediately determine if there had been any loss of life. It was only known that several people were missing. It wasn't until 2 AM yesterday morning, when the fire was completely extinguished and it was light, that workers were hired to sift through the ashes and found four bodies, including the store owner's wife, Fan Zhu Shi, her son, Fan Yuanshou, and apprentices Gao A Chun and You Mou. The store owner, Fan Jingchu, had jumped from a window to escape after the fire broke out, suffering injuries to his legs and arms, and has been hospitalized. The total loss of goods and property is estimated to be no less than seven or eight thousand taels of gold.</p>
<p>Four Lives Lost: The Gui Xiang Cun cigarette paper and sundry goods store was opened by Fan Chu, a Ningbo native, who had leased the land to build the store eight or nine years ago. The business was doing well. Its location was at the intersection of Baotong Road and Zhonghua Xin Road, and it was bordered by a fence on the Zhonghua Xin Road side, beyond which was a cemetery, preventing access. Therefore, the main entrance was next to the Zhou family mansion. On the night of the fire, the Fan couple and the store employees were all asleep. The store owner's wife and son lived upstairs, while the two apprentices lived downstairs. After the fire broke out, Fan's wife, Zhu Shi, immediately took her son and tried to escape down the stairs, but the door was locked and could not be opened immediately. By the time she tried to go back upstairs, the staircase had already been burned through, leaving them trapped. The two apprentices, Gao and You, also died at the same time. When Fan Zhu Shi's body was found yesterday, she was still firmly embracing her son, Yuanshou. Both bodies were completely charred, a truly tragic sight. The deceased, Fan Zhu Shi, was 42 years old, her son Yuanshou was 12 years old, and the two apprentices were Gao, 16 years old, and You, 18 years old.</p>
<p>Adding Fuel to the Flames: The five buildings at number 452 were interconnected. Although firefighters tried their best to put out the fire, the flames were too fierce and beyond control. In particular, dozens of boxes of kerosene stored in the Gui Xiang Cun were also affected, adding fuel to the flames and making the situation even worse. There are various theories about the cause of the fire. According to reports received by the police, the fire started downstairs. The Gui Xiang Cun sundry goods store had stocked up a lot of goods due to the upcoming Lunar New Year, and everything was reduced to ashes in the fire. The losses were significant. The insurance coverage was only for two thousand taels.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnappers in the Cai Fulin Case Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>The Other Three Accomplices Given Life Sentences</p>
<p>The Police Station Will Appeal the Acquittal</p>
<p>Cai Fulin, a comprador for the British American Tobacco Company, was first kidnapped on March 14 of the 18th year of the Republic [1929], and was released after a ransom of 30,000 yuan was paid. He was kidnapped again last year and released again after another ransom of 30,000 yuan. This past winter, the kidnappers in both cases were successively apprehended by Chief Detective Lu Liankui and others, and were handed over to the Special District Local Court for investigation. It is now known that Zhang Jinsheng, a colleague of Cai Fulin, masterminded the first kidnapping, with nine accomplices in total. After questioning, Judge Ge Zhitan announced yesterday afternoon that Zhang Jinsheng and Qiang Hong were each sentenced to death for the crime of jointly kidnapping and demanding a ransom. Jin Cangshou, Wang Daoshi, and Chen Wu Shi were each sentenced to life imprisonment. The four ransom letters were confiscated. Zhang Qian Shi, Chen Xianglong, and Shao Renmei were found not guilty. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer for the police station, argued that Zhang Qian Shi, as Zhang Jinsheng's wife, and Chen Xianglong, also a colleague of Cai Fulin, were both accomplices and should not have been acquitted. The police station found this verdict unacceptable and immediately announced that they would appeal the acquittal of these two individuals. Judge Ge then ordered the release of Shao Renmei, while Zhang Qian Shi and Chen Xianglong were kept in custody pending the appeal.</p>
<h3>The Case of Xu Yan, Corrupt and Neglectful Water Patrol Squad Leader</h3>
<p>Tried Yesterday by the Local Court</p>
<p>Involved in Four or Five Cases</p>
<p>Xu Yan, the dismissed leader of the Water Patrol Squad of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was discovered by the former bureau chief Yuan Liang to have repeatedly committed acts of corruption and dereliction of duty. The bureau chief dispatched inspectors to seize the large quantity of opium that he had embezzled, and also arrested police officer Jiang Shihe, who was involved. Arrest warrants were issued for his accomplices, detectives Ma Zhiyun and Zhang Longfa. They were then handed over to the Local Court. The prosecutor arrested Zhang Xiaogou, the owner of a small goods store, and issued arrest warrants for Wu Qiaofu, Qin Genda, and Shen Liansheng, also owners of small goods stores and opium dealers. It is now known that Xu Yan, Jiang Shihe, Zhang Xiaogou and others have been formally indicted. Xu Yan is accused of four or five counts of corruption and malfeasance. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Qian Chengjun opened the First Tribunal to hear the case.</p>
<p>Judge Xu Yan (questioned): Xu Yan, is Jiang Shihe your assistant? (Answer) I transferred him here. (Question) What about Zhang Xiaogou? He does business at the docks. (Question) What about Ma Zhiyun and Zhang Longfa? (Answer) Detectives. (Question) What about Wu Qiaofu? (Answer) The same business as Zhang Xiaogou. (Question) What about Li Yuting and Chen Jinshan?

(Answer) I don't know. (Question) In September of last year, opium was discovered on the Dada Steamer. Who seized it? (Answer) I was on sick leave, so Vice-Captain Zi Menggan was in charge. The patrol police seized it. (Question) How much was seized? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) It was 195 packages, but how much was handed over? (Answer) 45 packages. When I recovered from my illness, I realized it was a big problem, but my first leave was reported in a letter on September 12th or 13th, and after the Fifth Congress, I submitted another request to extend my leave. (Question) It is said that Ma Zhiyun sold the opium. (Answer) I didn't know before, I only found out after going to court. (Question) Did you get any money? (Answer) No. (Question) You once said that you received 750 yuan. You can't deny that. (Answer) At that time, the duties were completely handled by Vice-Captain Dou. After I found out, I transferred Jiang Shihe to the team as an assistant to investigate. The jurisdiction of the Water Patrol Squad extends from Yangsi Bridge in the south to Yejidun in the west, and to the Wusong Estuary in the east. It comprises four divisions and eight police stations. Every opium case was solved. (Question) When did this happen? (Answer) It seems like around September 12th or 13th. At this point, the judge said, "This is the first case. Now we will ask about the second case." (Question) On October 5th, the Second Division seized 700 boxes of red pills. Who seized them? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Who sent this to the headquarters? (Answer) At 6 PM that afternoon, I went to offer condolences because the mother of Yang Binxin, a member of the French Concession Municipal Council, had passed away. After I came back, I had a social engagement, and no one reported to me the next day. When the case was discovered, the bureau chief said that I sold the red pills and got more than 3,000 yuan. (Question) Was this 3,500 yuan also sold by Ma Zhiyun? (Answer) Yes. (Question) You admitted to receiving 1,700 yuan at the Public Security Bureau. (Answer) I didn't read the statement when the Public Security Bureau questioned me. I was forced to sign it. (Question) Why did you tear out a page from the case submission book?

(Question) On the night of October 20th, 3,800 taels of opium were seized in the Huangpu River. Who seized it? (Answer) Patrol officers Jiang Zhende and a Mr. Wang seized it. (Question) Were the people transporting the opium Qin Genda and Shen Liansheng? When was the boatman Zhou Fucheng brought in? (Answer) It was already midnight. I found him asleep at home. (Question) Did a Lu Jinbao come to your house? (Answer) Only Jiang Shihe came to report to me, saying that he had recruited them. I called patrol officer Wang Shuxiu to ask him. I said, let's deal with it tomorrow. The next day, the officer on duty said that there was a big commotion in the team, so I went. (Question) Jiang Shihe released these opium dealers? (Answer) I only found out after going to court. (Question) Was Ma Zhiyun at your house when Jiang Shihe came? (Answer) No, I was already asleep. (Question) Did you get 1,300 yuan? (Answer) No. (Question) Is the opium still there? (Answer) Yes, but the two opium dealers are gone. (Question) Did you take money to release them? (Answer) If I were guilty, I wouldn't have turned myself in to the bureau. At this point, the questioning moved to the fourth and fifth cases. (Question) How much did the small goods stores offer you each month? (Answer) If I hadn't banned the small goods stores, this incident wouldn't have happened. (Question) You said earlier that Wu Qiaofu and Zhang Sheng sent you 300 yuan, and Zhang Xiaogou sent 400 yuan. (Answer) I didn't take it. It was Inspector Zhou Dehou who took it. I never met Zhang Xiaogou and the others. Then he said that he had never imagined that he would be transferred to the Water Patrol Squad. He was recommended by He Yingqin when he came to Shanghai because he had successfully negotiated the building of Hague Road in the Sixth District, Sixth Precinct, during his tenure, and the bureau chief thought he was capable. The previous captain resigned due to the kidnapping case of the "Shishi Xinbao" [China Times] manager, so I was transferred to be the captain. I have always been very dedicated to my duties. The judge said that this statement was irrelevant to the case and did not need to be recorded in the testimony. Xu Yan confirmed that this was because the person being questioned was not giving his testimony as fully as possible.</p>
<p>Jiang Shihe: The judge then questioned Jiang Shihe. (Question) When did you become an assistant in the Water Patrol Squad? (Answer) I am a fourth-class police officer, and the order to write was on September 12th. I was transferred from the Sixth District. (Question) Who transferred you? (Answer) I received an order from the Public Security Bureau. (Question) Who proposed it? (Answer) I don't know. (Answer) How much opium did patrolmen Jiang Zhende and others seize on October 20th? (Answer) Five bags. (Question) When did they seize it? (Answer) I don't know. I was already asleep at the time. The case-receiving patrolman reported it to patrol officer Wang Shuxiu, passing by my lodgings. (Question) When did you go to Xu Yan's place? (Answer) I went to his house around 2 or 3 AM to report to him. (Question) Was Ma Zhiyun there? (Answer) Yes, in Xu Yan's living room. I went to where he was sleeping. (Question) Did the opium dealers Qin Genda and Pai Liansheng leave on the captain's order? (Answer) No. (Question) You confessed at the Public Security Bureau that you released them on behalf of the captain. (Answer) The section chief scared me by saying that I would be tortured and forced me to say yes. (Question) Then who released them? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) How much money did you get? (Answer) None. I am a fourth-class police captain. If I wanted to release someone, I would just tell Officer Wang.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaogou: The judge then questioned Zhang Xiaogou. (Question) What do you do? (Answer) A bargeman. (Question) Do you know Xu Yan? (Answer) I don't know him. (Question) Why did you give him 400 yuan? (Answer) I didn't. (Question) You are a small goods store owner? (Answer) No. (Question) If you don't know Xu Yan, why would he falsely accuse you? (Answer) There is no such thing. (Question) Why didn't you respond to the summons until you were arrested with a warrant? (Answer) If I had known, I would have surrendered myself earlier. At this point, the judge said that there were still many witnesses in the case who had not been summoned and adjourned the hearing to a later date to summon the witnesses and continue the trial. The defendants Xu Yan and Jiang Shihe were returned to custody, Zhang Xiaogou was released on bail, and the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Strange Drama of Two Families Fighting Over a Coffin</h3>
<p>A Woman Married Twice and Had Two Sons with Each Husband</p>
<p>Fighting Over the Coffin After Death, Even Resorting to Violence</p>
<p>Resolved by Marrying a Deceased Wife to the First Husband</p>
<p>The deceased farmer Wang Changgen, who lived in Wangjiatang, west of Hongqiao Town in Shanghai, married Zhang, and had two sons, Yutang, now 32 years old and an employee of Yoyee Hong, and Songtang, 30 years old and working for a certain company. However, when Changgen died, they were both young. Due to financial difficulties, Zhang abandoned her two biological sons and remarried to Peng Axin, a carpenter in the vicinity. Yutang and Songtang were raised by Changgen's sister-in-law, Shen. After Zhang remarried, she also had two sons, Qingxiang, 27 years old, and Qingsheng, 25 years old, both of whom were married. The two brothers inherited their father's business, which has been doing well recently and they have accumulated some savings. Unexpectedly, after Axin died in the winter of the 16th year of the Republic [1927], the Wang brothers repeatedly went to the Peng family to persuade their mother to return home to fulfill her filial duty. However, Zhang vowed not to return and said, "After I die, you can carry my coffin back and bury it with your father Changgen. Although Qing and Qingsheng were born to a different father, they should be treated as family. Do not argue with each other to avoid resentment." Yutang and others, seeing that they could not persuade her, had to return home. Unexpectedly, on the 20th of last month, Zhang died suddenly from an illness. The coffin was temporarily placed next to Peng Axin's tomb, awaiting a propitious day for burial. After hearing the news, Yutang and the others were overcome with grief and immediately put on mourning clothes at home, observing the proper etiquette. They said, "Living in this world with a father but no mother is laughable," and on the night of the 6th of this month, they gathered a group of people and secretly stole Zhang's coffin back, hiding it in the woodshed and sending people to guard it day and night to prevent it from being stolen back. Later, when Qing heard about this, he was also unwilling to let it go. On the night before last (the 11th), he led a group of people to go in the snowy night. They were discovered by the guards who confronted them. Neither side would give way, resulting in a fight. As a result, Peng Qingxiang was injured and suffered two knife wounds to his leg and fell to the ground. The others dispersed. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Yutang hired someone to mediate the situation. It has now been settled. Peng Qingxiang is treating his injuries, and the Zhang coffin will be taken back by the Peng family for burial. In addition, a deceased wife (a virgin who died many years ago) will be married to Wang Changgen, with three days of chanting. All expenses will be borne by the Peng family. The drama of fighting over a coffin has now been peacefully resolved.</p>
<h3>Reward Offered for the Arrest of the Perpetrator of a Filial Crime</h3>
<p>Reward of 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Wanted: Li Shude</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating that it was offering a reward for the arrest of a criminal. The notice stated that the complainant, Li Bolu, of Haiyan, a businessman in Shanghai residing at 3 Xingyou Lane, Zixia Road, outside the Dadongmen, had filed a report stating that his grandson, Shude, was a ne'er-do-well who loafed about. On the morning of January 3rd of this year, at around 10:00 AM, he and a friend dressed in military uniforms, wearing armed belts, speaking with a Hunan accent, and around 20 years old, whose name was unknown, came to the house together, claiming to have come to Shanghai from afar. They were invited to lunch. Later, the complainant and his daughter went out on business, leaving only his wife, Yao, Shude, and his friend at home. Unexpectedly, at around 5:00 PM in the evening, he returned home to find no one at home and a sense of unease. He searched everywhere and was horrified to find his wife, Yao, strangled with a rope and lying dead in the kitchen. Valuables were also stolen. There was no doubt that it was his grandson Shude and his friend who had conspired to kill and steal the property before fleeing. He immediately reported the incident to the First District Police Station for investigation, but without success. Later, the Shanghai Local Court sent officials to investigate and question the case. This case of murder for money is a tragic example of a filial crime. The circumstances are serious and shocking. If the criminal is allowed to escape the law for a long time, how can the national laws be upheld and public safety be maintained? Therefore, the complainant is attaching photographs of the criminal Li Shude and is earnestly requesting that the Bureau approve and issue a notice, offering a reward and ordering the subordinate detectives to intensify their search. If the criminal in this case can be apprehended and the facts confirmed, he is willing to provide a reward of 200 yuan for safekeeping, hoping to solve the case as soon as possible, punish the perpetrator according to the law, and comfort the departed soul. He is grateful both in life and in death. The complainant is submitting twenty photographs of the criminal Li Shude. Upon investigation, this case was previously reported by the First District, and since it is a filial crime with serious circumstances, it is no ordinary case of murder for money. An order has been issued to strictly investigate and arrest the criminal, and this Bureau has offered a reward of 300 yuan, ordering all subordinate police detectives to cooperate closely and arrest and bring the criminal to justice. Now, based on the previous report, the complainant is voluntarily offering an additional reward of 200 yuan to solve the case as soon as possible. Therefore, this notice is issued for public information. Regardless of who it is, anyone who can apprehend and deliver the fugitive Li Shude and his unknown Hunanese accomplice to the Bureau, or provide accurate information leading to their arrest, will be rewarded immediately upon confirmation of the facts, with the reward being held in reserve and never delayed. However, no one is allowed to make false accusations due to personal grudges, which would harm innocent people. Be careful! This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Good News for Creditors of the Riye Bank</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing's Responsible Response</p>
<p>The Provisional Committee of Creditors of the Savings Department of the Riye Bank Dàshìjiè (Great World) was anxious because the repayment period was approaching but there was no clear plan or date for settling the debts. Yesterday (the 13th), they again sent representatives, including Jing Xiren, Zuo Zhengping, Lu Bingyan, Cai Wenbin, Yuan Youlan, Tu Yunchao and others, to the Municipal Government and Yu, Wang, Wang, and Yuan to negotiate separately. The results were very satisfactory, and Yu's statement was particularly sincere, demonstrating a responsible attitude and expression. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing's Statement: After the representatives of the Provisional Committee of Creditors presented the plight of the impoverished creditors and earnestly expressed that the majority of creditors firmly believed in the resolve and enthusiasm of the officials and the Municipal Government to protect the common people, they requested that a plan be promptly determined and the debts be repaid as soon as possible. Mr. Yu then gave a responsible response, stating that although the three had withdrawn from the Huang Resettlement Association, they still cared about the suffering of the majority of the common people and would continue to earnestly consult with Mr. Wang, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Yuan to seek a guarantee plan from the Municipal Government. Although progress had been hindered by various disputes, he would always be responsible for maintaining the situation. Currently, regarding the issue of the French Court lawsuit, it had been decided that Mayor Zhang would hire Wu Jingxiong, Chen Ting Shuo, and Qin Liankui as pro bono lawyers to represent the Municipal Government and the 10,000+ creditors who had registered with both Xu Yongzuo and the Provisional Committee of Creditors to file a lawsuit in the French Court for legal redress and then fundamentally resolve the situation to ensure that the creditors would not suffer losses and the repayment time would not be extended. The resolution plan would be divided into: (1) liquidating the five business operations of the Gongfa Company; (2) liquidating Huang's personal property; (3) requiring the directors of the Gongfa Company to assume unlimited liability; (4) the Municipal Government would be responsible for finding a way to maintain the situation. As for the source of funds, it had been determined early on: (1) the Chinese-Western Pharmacy was valued at 200,000; (2) the Hot Spring Bathhouse was valued at 50,000; (3) the Fuchang Tobacco Company was valued at 1.3 million, with 500,000 to be handed over first; (4) Huang's personal property would be handed over with 400,000 first; (5) the Dàshìjiè (Great World) was assumed to be worth over a million, and would be handled by the Municipal Government for further determination. All plans would have a practical solution announced no later than next Monday, and he would be responsible regardless of the outcome. He hoped that all creditors would not cause more disputes due to impatience, and especially that savings passbooks and deposit slips should not be sold at a discount due to incitement, which could lead to unexpected losses. The representatives were satisfied and expressed their gratitude before departing.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government's Statement: The representatives presented their business cards to see Mayor Zhang. As a municipal meeting was in progress, a representative was sent to receive them, accept their petition, and respond on behalf of the mayor, stating that the mayor was discussing a practical solution with Mr. Yu and others and would announce it to the public as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng's Remarks: Mr. Yuan stated that there had not been much concrete progress in recent days due to various twists and turns. He has always prioritized the interests of the public, but his position is more difficult. However, he would fully respect Mr. Yu's suggestions to ensure that the entire debt was not lost. As far as his personal burden was concerned, as long as he was capable, he would gladly comply.</p>

Yesterday, due to the branch road from Luodian to Jiading, which was newly built last year, the roadbed was not firm, and the wheels sank into the mud, making it difficult to travel. Therefore,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The company announced the suspension of service yesterday afternoon. The announcement is excerpted as follows: "The roadbed from Jiading to Luodian is loose after months of rain and snow, and driving is extremely dangerous.

<p>Lu Yifang, the editor of the "Ling Bao" tri-weekly, was sued in a criminal self-accusation to the Shanghai Special District Court by movie star Hu Die for publishing an article about the Snow Butterfly marriage, claiming the article was libelous. The court found the facts to be true and sentenced Lu Yifang to a fine of 300 yuan and ordered him to deposit 500 yuan as bail. Lu was not satisfied and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file an appeal. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, President Zhou Hanting, together with Judges Cheng and Xiao, summoned Lu, who was accompanied by lawyers Jiang Yiping and Zhang Chongding, to court to state the reasons for the appeal. The appellant, Hu Die, still hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to appear in court as her representative.

<h3>Investigation of Two Extortion Gangs</h3>
<p>Yun Tieqiao and Others Were Extorted</p>
<p>Guns, Bullets, and Stamps Were Seized</p>
<p>Chen Junbao, who lives at No. 197 Moore Road, received two threatening letters last month demanding 5,000 yuan. He reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives Wang Zhusheng and Shan Huihai to arrest Zhou Wangzuo, a native of Shaoxing, at a Chinese-Western teahouse on Edward Road. The day before yesterday afternoon, another accomplice, Zhang Jinhai (aka Yong Sheng), a native of Suzhou, was arrested at the Pin Fang Teahouse on Guangdong Road. They confessed that the items they needed were placed in the Dongxing Inn on Lafei Road in the French Concession. When they went to search, they found a rattan box containing seven bullets, many envelopes and stationery, and various stamps. After investigation, it was learned that Zhou and Zhang had extorted large sums of money from doctors Shen Zhuoru and Yun Tieqiao on Gu Ling Road and Yunnan Road from December 1928 to May 1929. Shen Yuruo was also extorted 200 yuan. Wang Gaosheng and Tian Yushu, although they sent letters demanding 3,000 and 2,000 yuan respectively, did not receive any money in the end. Yesterday morning, it was rumored that the victims had taken the two bandits to the Special District Court, where Judge Ge interrogated them. Police lawyer Wang Tang presented the seized items as evidence, briefly described the process, and requested that another hearing be scheduled. Zhou Wangzuo confessed that Zhang was an accomplice. Zhang also admitted that he, Zhou, and a Tan surnamed person who was on the run, discussed extorting the Chen family in a smoking den in the French Concession a month ago.

<h3>Young Man Dies Tragically on Ferry</h3>
<p>Determined to be Caused by Poisoning</p>
<p>Whether There are Family Members is Unknown</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:15, the Taikoo Company's fast Da Ban Tou small ferry was about to return to Pudong at the French Company's wharf, when a nameless young man with a pale face was helped onto the ferry to cross to Pudong by a Mr. Jia, a hotel employee from the Xiangbin Hotel on Sima Road. After the matter was completed, Mr. Jia returned to shore, and the ferry immediately returned to Pudong. Unexpectedly, just as the ferry arrived in Pudong, the young man suddenly fell down and died. Zhao Shengsheng, the captain of the ferry, saw the situation and was unable to provide immediate assistance, so he returned the ferry to its original location and reported the incident to the Water Patrol Police and the French Concession Police. Soon, the French Municipal Council arrived by car and transported the deceased to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for temporary burial, pending investigation and identification. It is reported that the deceased was about 20 years old, wearing a blue cloth jacket and trousers, a peaked cap, and broken shoes. His name is unknown. Judging from his appearance, he seemed to be a crew member. He had a packet of cloth medicine powder and several copper coins on his person. Observers unanimously determined that he had committed suicide by poisoning, but the cause of his death is still difficult to determine at this time. According to the hotel employee, Mr. Jia, the deceased called him to help him board the ferry when he was not dead at the dock. The deceased claimed that he lived in Zhangjiayan, Pudong, and so on. Whether there are family members to identify him will be investigated later.</p>

<h3>Squabbling over Hot Water Leads to Fight</h3>
<p>Detective Wang Licheng Stabbed</p>
<p>Yang Fuxing Halal Noodle Shop, owned by Yang Si, a native of Yangzhou, has been located at No. 55 Anna Jin Road, behind the Slaughterhouse Company in the French Concession. Yesterday morning around 9:00, Yang's wife, Zhang, went to the boiling water stove downstairs at the Longqing Teahouse at No. 69 nearby to get hot water. A quarrel arose over whether the water was boiling or not, and Zhang slapped a Guan surnamed waiter. The waiter retaliated by pushing Zhang into the road, causing her to fall and become covered in mud. Both sides went to the Songshan Road Police Station, where the police chief ordered each to pay a fine of one yuan as a warning. After returning home, Zhang complained to her husband, Yang Si, who was furious. He immediately gathered dozens of colleagues from the Henan gang and went to the boiling water stove to cause trouble. At that time, the owner of the Longqing Teahouse, Wang Dekui, heard the news and rushed to mediate. He invited the owner of the boiling water stove, Liu Changde, to have tea upstairs. Wang explained the misunderstanding and instructed Liu to bear the full amount of the fines imposed by the police on both sides. He also ordered Liu to pour tea and apologize to Yang to settle the matter. However, Yang firmly refused, insisting that Liu buy firecrackers and send Zhang home. Liu refused, and before they could come to an agreement, Yang ordered a violent attack. At that time, police detective Wang Licheng happened to be at the teahouse on business and was stabbed in the jaw with a sharp axe. They also tried to snatch the pistol that Wang was carrying. After being injured, Wang immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched detectives and arrested three people, including Yang Si, for investigation.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: After reading the news item in your newspaper of the 13th of this month, "Jiang Youzhi's Letter to the French Concession," it is inconsistent with the facts. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, I received a phone call from my friend Fan Songji, saying that Dong Kang had repeatedly discussed the settlement of Jiang Youzhi's lawsuit and had drafted a concrete plan. I was asked to go and discuss it. I asked Mr. Fan whether it was correct that the other party was capricious. Mr. Fan replied that the other party had written evidence to prove it. I went to Mr. Fan's residence. Mr. Fan showed me the other party's written settlement conditions, which were signed and sealed by Wang Kanghou, the representative of the Jiang family. Only then did Yu believe it. Mr. Fan called again at about 7:00 p.m., saying that he had arranged to complete the deal at the New World Hotel and asked me to go to the appointment immediately. I went to the room of my friend Yan Zegao because I had a party talking at home. (249) I rested temporarily. I met Mr. Fan and said that the other party had opened room number 239. At that time, in addition to Yan Zegao, there were Hang Jun, Shi Jun, Xu Jun Chihen, Ping Jun Jinya, Zhan Jifeng, Yan Yinwu, and two lawyers and Mrs. Yan Zegao and Mrs. Zhan. It was not until midnight that Qiu Jun Zijia came again. Hang Jun and others did not go for my business, but for other negotiations. I have never been to the other party's room. Only Mr. Fan and others negotiated back and forth. It is reported that in room number 239, there were the other party himself, Wang Kanghou, and the secretary Cai, and two female guests whom Mr. Fan and others did not know. All the conditions were negotiated at that time, but because the other party requested cash and there was no way to raise it at midnight, and the parents had to be present, it was not established. The next day, the court opened the trial, and Attorney Wang also stated this in his statement, which can be verified in the record. The original manuscript suddenly claimed that he was coerced and chased, and a large number of unrelated men and women surrounded him. I really don't know what it is based on. It is ridiculous to deceive oneself and deceive others. All the gentlemen present are well-known people in society. It is not difficult to ask them about the truth. It is useless to listen to such slander and only lose their personality. I hereby submit the facts and hope that you will investigate and correct them to clarify the facts and correct the audience. Yu Don respectfully to the Shen Bao office.</p>

<h3>Asian Education Conference</h3>
<p>Our Country's Huang Qiming and Gao Jianfu Attend</p>
<p>Most of the Discussion Focuses on Indian Education Issues</p>
<p>丨Religious Boundaries Too Strict丨</p>
<p>丨India Lacks Secondary Education丨</p>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondent) The Asian Education Conference was held in Benares, India, from December 26th to 30th last year. The representatives from our country were Huang Qiming, the principal of Guangzhou Peizheng Middle School, and Gao Jianfu, a famous Lingnan painter. Mr. Gao stayed in India to engage in art exhibitions at the invitation of local organizations. Mr. Huang has now returned to the country and returned to the province. The reporter believes that the Asian Education Conference is also related to our country. The people of our country want to know what the situation is. He specially visited Mr. Huang to inquire about everything. According to him, the Asian Education Conference was initiated by the World Education Association. The previous World Education Conference was held in Geneva. At the conference, at the request of the Indian representatives, the decision to hold this conference was made. This conference was held in Benares, India. Representatives from all Asian countries participated, but they were all overseas Chinese in the local area. There were three representatives specially sent by the country. The representatives from our country were Mr. Yu and Gao Jianfu. During the conference, from December 26th to 20th, for five consecutive days, the conference was attended by thousands of people. In addition to the representatives appointed by various countries, the rest were all educational figures from all parts of India. The discussion items were divided into women's education, civilian education, and secondary education groups. Mr. Yu was appointed as the chairman of the secondary education discussion group. In summary, this conference has very little relationship with our country, and Japan has absolutely none. It can be called the All-India Education Conference. Mr. Yu gave a detailed report on the status of secondary education in our country at the conference, and advised India to pay attention to secondary education. The Indians listened to this and were quite convinced by Mr. Yu's words. As for the status of education in India, it only has a deformed development. It only pays attention to higher education and does not pay attention to civilian education. Secondary education is even more lacking. Brothers have visited the International University founded by the poet Tagore. Although its scale is small, its facilities are quite complete. It has students of all races, and there are also two people from our country. Benares University has even more complete facilities and a very large scale. It is said that at the beginning of the establishment, it cost more than 10,000 yuan, all of which was automatically donated by the Indians. They pay so much attention to higher education, but it is a pity that they ignore secondary civilian education and do not know how to promote it. In recent years, the academic community has also been quite developed. For example, the Benares Literature Award and the Science Award have both been won by Indians. The Indians are most proud of this. It is not surprising that the Eastern spiritual civilization won the Literature Award, but it is enough for the Indian academic community to show a different color by winning the Science Award. Mr. Yu has traveled to various places and found that the squalor of the Indian countryside is worse than that of our country. The gap between the rich and poor classes among the people is too great. This may be due to the lack of secondary education. The strict religious boundaries are also a major reason for the slow evolution of the Indian nation. The boundaries between Hinduism and Islam are very strict. The followers of the two religions often clash. Therefore, even if they are united and single-minded in seeking national affairs, even the great leaders are inevitably bound by religion. Therefore, if India wants to seek national glory, it will not succeed without breaking the concept of religion. The president of Benares University, Mr. Morihua, once published the proposal of the two religions working together, but after Mr. Mo shook hands with Muslims, he always washed his hands after returning home, which shows how deep the concept of religion is. There was no public banquet at this conference, which is rare in Western countries. The reason is that everyone is restricted by religious doctrine and cannot eat together. Now the Indians still show goodwill towards our overseas Chinese, and they are no longer as discriminatory as before, and they hope that the next conference will be held in our country.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Direct Schools to Prepare Budgets</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education sent a telegram to schools directly under its jurisdiction, ordering them to prepare budgets. The telegram roughly stated: "Having examined the National Government Gazette issued on the tenth of this month, it is clearly ordered in Article 1 of the National Budget Preparation and Submission Procedures for the Twentieth Year that 'All central agencies shall prepare three copies of the agency's annual revenue and expenditure estimates (first-level estimates) and submit them to the competent authorities before March 1 of the twentieth year, etc.'" Please be informed and immediately comply with the time limit for submitting to the Ministry of Education. [Official] Seal.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Declares the Significance of Phonetic Symbols</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on Chen Yicheng's request for a declaration on the meaning of phonetic symbols, issued a directive stating: "The submitted document has been reviewed and understood. The original submission contains many doubts about phonetic symbols. Generally speaking, these doubts are nothing more than not knowing the proper characters, the complexity of adding phonetic notations alongside reading, and the unaesthetic shapes of the characters. It is important to understand that the creation of phonetic symbols is precisely for those who do not know how to read to learn to read. The Chinese writing system is complex and difficult to recognize, which is a major obstacle to the popularization of education. The phonetic symbols, including initials and finals, total only forty. These symbols are simple and easy to recognize, easy to spell, and easy to annotate beside the proper characters, allowing one to recognize characters by recognizing the phonetic symbols. All books, documents, official notices, etc., can then be read, proper characters can be recognized, and knowledge can be increased. The establishment of phonetic symbols is precisely to encourage those who do not know how to read to learn to read and write, not to abandon proper characters once phonetic symbols are introduced, and to never need to further recognize proper characters or read books. Since these phonetic symbols are designed to assist in recognizing proper characters, they should naturally be annotated beside the proper characters and should not be separated in any way. How can it be suspected of being like 'building a bed under a house'? As for the shapes, the simple shapes and ease of recognition are precisely the characteristics of phonetic symbols. The shapes of proper characters each have their own strengths and should not be compared in terms of superiority. In short, all the concerns in the original submission are misunderstandings. The reason for these concerns is that the person who submitted the document is someone who already knows how to read. For someone who already knows how to read to then learn phonetic symbols, it is natural to feel somewhat inconvenienced. However, the number of people in our country who know how to read only accounts for 20% of the total population. The remaining 80%, or more than 30 million people, are mostly illiterate and need to learn to read and write through phonetic symbols. Therefore, promoting phonetic symbols is good news for those who do not know how to read. The Ministry has therefore promulgated measures for promoting phonetic symbols in various provinces and cities and is immediately distributing small booklets for phonetic symbol instruction to urge active implementation nationwide. The person who submitted the document has done little research on the effectiveness and significance of promoting phonetic symbols, so this special clarification is hereby issued for your information."</p>

<h3>Japan Revises Women's Basketball Rules</h3>
<p>Adopting American Rules</p>
<p>Because the Current Rules are Too Drastic</p>
<p>World News Agency, Tokyo: The Japan YWCA is holding its 25th anniversary celebration. The association's sports department took the opportunity to initiate the revision of women's basketball rules and contacted women's sports organizations and sports departments of women's schools across the country to work towards implementing the new rules. According to Ms. Kawanishi Hatsuko, an officer of the association's sports department, the women's basketball rules currently used in Japan are the same as those for men. This sport is too intense. From the perspective of women's physical strength and its educational value, it is difficult to obtain good results. The new rules are based on the American women's basketball rules, which differ greatly from the traditional men's basketball rules. The old rules divided the entire game into two halves, while the revised rules divide it into four quarters. The rest time is set at two minutes each. The court is also divided into three sections, and the activities of WhileQuarterCentret are limited within the collection degree. In addition, there are also important differences in the shortening of game time and the use of venues. It is believed that after the application of these new rules, basketball will be simplified and popularized in the women's sports world.</p>

<h3>Foch's Diary of the European War by a French General</h3>
<p>Translated by Gu Ang Ruo</p>
<p>September 4th, my detachment was assigned all the army supplies it was due, and thus separated from the Fourth Army to become independent, officially forming the Ninth Army. Later, it received reinforcements from the Eighteenth Infantry Division (Ninth Army Corps), which had been temporarily stationed in Lulles since August 20th…</p>
<p>The task of the Ninth Army (September 9th) was very clear. No matter the difficulties, the army must support the battle force on the front line, prevent the enemy from breaking through the defense line, and prevent them from crossing the line, until victory was certain. Therefore, I repeatedly encouraged the soldiers to fight to the death, and told them about the enemy's situation in the remaining sections of the front, so that they would know my firm belief in our final victory.</p>
<p>According to reports received by the Ninth Army Headquarters, the German army had not stopped marching since the start of the war. Their perseverance had been pushed to the extreme. Many units had long lost their officers and non-commissioned officers. The regiments were in a state of chaos, and the general officers had lost control.</p>
<p>"The enemy firmly believes that we can no longer resist. Our brave attack will definitely catch the enemy off guard.</p>
<p>"The importance of taking advantage of this opportunity is difficult to overstate. I only hope that each of you will muster the remaining courage to make one last strike. Our nation will not lack this final enemy force when it is in a critical moment of survival.</p>
<p>"The chaos in the enemy's ranks is a harbinger of our victory.</p>
<p>"If you can contain them in one go today, tomorrow we can drive them out of our country.</p>
<p>"Remember that victory belongs to those who persevere the longest. France's reputation and full strength are still uncertain. Work hard, and you can win.</p>
<p>"The reports from the entire front are very good…"</p>
<p>Most importantly, the right wing of the Forty-Second Division has strong support. The Eleventh Army Corps now seems to be deployed to assist the division in combat. Colonel Weigand directly ordered the Twenty-First Division in Linser at five o'clock.</p>
<p>At 5:15, the Forty-Second Division attacked the Conno Court flour mill from the Linsevero line (north of Gaolei).</p>
<p>The Eleventh Army Corps has been ordered to attack on its entire line to assist the right wing of the division in its advance.</p>
<p>The Twenty-First Division immediately attacked the ridge northwest of Ouwei.</p>
<p>As for myself, I gave a final encouragement to the soldiers, calling on them to put all their energy into this attack. So, on the evening of September 9th, we launched a major counterattack from west to east towards Fuerxiang Benoia and its key areas.</p>
<p>Our soldiers were truly exhausted, but now, with another attack, we showed our determination to win, and we calculated that when the Forty-Second Division launched a full-scale attack, we would indeed have a chance to prevail against the enemy, who had been exhausted after days of fierce attacks. Moreover, the enemy's initial victory allowed them to advance so quickly to the south, and their position was therefore quite unstable.</p>
<p>The areas around Fuerxiangnuo and along the roads were littered with dead and wounded, which proves that the enemy had indeed suffered heavy losses. A large number of prisoners were captured, and spoils of war were continuously delivered. The enemy's panicked retreat had already shown signs.</p>
<p>The Allied counter-offensive on September 9th was underway. On the 10th, the German army began to retreat. By the 11th, it had collapsed from retreat. Foch's Ninth Army's advance was unimpeded. On the 12th, it actually crossed the Mang River. On that day, Foch added this sentence to the order of the day, "The plan has not changed. Attacks are underway everywhere. Pursuits are underway everywhere."</p>
<p>The Battle of the Mang River was coming to an end. It was indeed a great victory. It was the credit of Commander-in-Chief Joffre. He began planning this great battle on August 24th and</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>commanded the battle until the end. After we suffered setbacks on the border, he immediately realized that the battle was not going well, so he stopped fighting and prepared to wait until he had replenished the weaknesses that had been discovered, and then resume fighting with renewed vigor. He employed powerful tactics in Belgium, fully understood the enemy's goals, and without hesitation, he redeployed his troops. Because some officers had evidence of incompetence, he redistributed all the officers. He set up a diversion in the west and continued to retreat until the appropriate moment, he ordered his troops to stop retreating. After the army turned around, he cleverly combined offensive and defensive warfare, and then used planned movements to give the enemy a fatal blow.</p>
<p>From Woerke to Lulles, the entire army fully understood that France could not survive another defeat, so they fought with great unity and effort. Senior commanders and their staff competed with each other to carry out their tasks, and helped each other with the best spirit of friendship. Soldiers fought until they were exhausted and hoarse, fell on the battlefield, got up and fought again, and fought even more fiercely.</p>
<p>This war further proves that the spirit of the army in wartime is a reflection of the nation's deepest feelings. When these latent forces are well guided by a capable commander-in-chief, great historical achievements are established. This is the meaning of the Battle of the Mang River.</p>
<p>Paris, the heart of France, is now saved by the victory in which her direct protectors participated. Their military authorities sent them to the battlefield because the survival of the French capital was at stake.</p>
<p>The German plan failed, and the German prestige was completely swept away. The swift and fierce offensive, hoping to make France collapse, has now not only stopped but also been repelled, and a part of it has even collapsed.</p>
<p>In this situation, what needs to be studied is how the enemy will reorganize their troops in the future, and what new plans will be adopted for operations on the Western Front. During this period, this is our most pressing concern. Can the large Russian army on the Eastern Front defeat the enemy? Can the German-Austrian alliance support the two-front war? Their previous concentration on one front has failed.</p>
<p>On August 28th, when I led the Ninth Army, the headquarters' official report stated, "From Kongmu to Fusiqi...the attack was victorious." The official report on July 10th stated, "French victory confirmed..." I am very pleased that our army's turn from defeat to victory is not unrelated.</p>
<p>The German forces attacking the Ninth Army, hoping to break through the French central front, are as follows:</p>
<p>German Second Army丨丨Tenth Army Corps (also attacking the French Tenth Army Corps), Tenth Reserve Army Corps and Guard Army Corps.</p>
<p>German Third Army丨丨Thirteenth Army Corps (Thirty-Second and Twenty-Third Divisions) and Twelfth Reserve Army Corps (Twenty-Third and Twenty-Fourth Reserve Divisions).</p>
<p>While clearing the remnants of the enemy in the Xie Long area, I received the unfortunate news that my family had been suffering on the front line since August 22nd. This news was brought to me by Sarai, the commander of the Third Army. At that time, I was preoccupied with urgent national affairs and had no time to mourn. However, I felt at the time that if these voluntary sacrifices were not in vain, then the victory that had already been achieved would surely be on the rise.</p>
<p>While in Xie Long, many local dignitaries requested to see me. The first was the governor of Mang County, Xie Polong. I apologized to him for occupying part of the area, and gave him hope that we would only need to occupy it for a short period of time. In fact, the headquarters was stationed there for several months. Following Xie Polong was Xi Tiexi, the teacher of Xie Long. He did not leave his church during the German invasion. He was detailing how he personally requested Prince Saxon during the short period of enemy occupation, so that the town could be exempt from heavy donations. At this time, Senator Bai Qiya and Congressmen Meng Hu and Dr. Beixiang also arrived together. We therefore unanimously congratulated the greatness and strength of our beloved France, whose athletes completely forgot the conflicts of political parties and worked together to repel the enemy.</p>
<p>After October 4th, the fighting on the front line of the Ninth Army turned into a period of stagnation, and it stagnated for a long time. The enemy used its powerful artillery to consolidate its superior position, and built several continuous deep trenches, protected by machine guns, with hidden cannons on both wings. This was not the time to drive out the enemy. On September 26th, the enemy's general offensive also completely failed. Our defense became more and more solid day by day. We don't need to worry about how the enemy will attack. In this situation, there is currently no hope of determining victory or defeat in the Xiangben area.</p>
<p>As for what happened on the remaining defense lines in front, especially on the left wing formed by our army, I only vaguely learned a little from the daily official reports. In this confusing state, I received a notification from the Commander-in-Chief on the afternoon of October 4th, calling me to his headquarters in Romelu. I reported there at around 4 p.m.</p>
<p>General Joffre told me that the goal of the Allied left wing's operations had always been to encircle the German right wing. If this plan could not succeed, our strategy could prevent the enemy from making the same move to encircle our left wing. Based on this goal, he had already transferred General Kosternera's Second Army (headquarters in Bailetayi) to the left of the Sixth Army north of Wo Yisi and Sham. General Mabao's detachment (headquarters in Saint Paul) was being ordered to advance with Arras for the same mission. The detachment had been constantly replenished and often ordered to operate independently. On October 5th, the detachment was formed into the Tenth Army.</p>
<p>Responsible for liaison between the Second and Tenth Armies was General Belucci's volunteer corps (headquarters in Duran).</p>
<p>The British army also requested to be transferred from Ai Yisi to our left wing. This request has been approved. The transfer will be carried out soon. The British army headquarters will be located in Saint Amel. Finally, the Belgian army gathered near Antewerp will sooner or later find a way to cooperate. Because several commanders in this area were a little hesitant and hoped to reach a satisfactory compromise with our Allied forces, the Commander-in-Chief decided to appoint me as the Assistant to the Commander-in-Chief to go to the Northern Front immediately to command and assist the Allied forces in combat.</p>
