<p>新義州七月七日晚十時、鮮人暴動、　集五六百人、龔擊眞砂町華僑、幸各大商店、事前得有消息、早已閉門、僅碎門窗玻璃、貨物未受損失、領館於事前、經與道知事及警署交涉預防、及至發生暴動、即電知警署派多數警察鎭壓、旋即散去、華僑均到領館、所有商會重要賬據、亦運至領館、八日晨謡言更甚、暴動蜂起、行路華人、受傷者頗多、朱領事因風聲緊急、即馳至道廳及警署協商、借用汽車將市外僑民運至安全地方、一時來領館及商會避難者、一千二百餘人、赴安東者三千五百餘人、又以領館及商會房屋狹小、復將老弱婦稚送往安東、計六百餘人、安東縣政府商埠公安局總商會等、指定戲園二家電影院三家、設立收容所五處、妥爲安置、是夜新義州領館及商會、嚴重警備、僑民所遺商店空屋、均有警察巡邏看守、商品家財、尙無重大損失、次日調查、受輕傷者十四人、此外中之島於七日夜被暴徒擊破華商商店門窗玻璃木板者四家、惟東生福商店、損失較重、約逹百元、警官聞訉、出而彈壓、暴民又轉向市外襲擊荒川組工人宿舍、破門闖入、將工人于福京胸脇、毆傷致死、尙有五六名負傷者、兇手被捕、連同其他暴行者、共拘留四十六人、又有義州郡三成金礦會社工人、被暴徒毆死一人、其他地方、如雪山北鎭大榆洞宣川定州南市龜城楊市郭山博川寗邊義州等處華橋、亦有被毆受傷及商店被襲擊者、惟情節尙均不重也、查此次事變之發生、其直接原因、由於日本朝鮮各報、就萬寳山事件、揑造事實、擴大宣傳、對於朝鮮無知羣衆、肆行煽惑、仁川事變、發生最早、即因京城朝鮮日報所發行之號外、謂萬寳山事件、中國人與朝鮮人衝突之結果、朝鮮人被殺者數百名、（始則謂二百餘名、繼則以誤傳誤、謂至八百餘名、）以致羣情憤激、遂起暴動、我駐鮮各地領事、一經得信、立即要求該地官吏、派警彈壓、並要求加派武裝軍警出動、而其時期朝鮮總督及政務總監、正當新舊更迭之際、總督府絕無負責之人、再四要求、不肯及時下令武裝或派憲兵制止、以致各地辦法參差、號令不一、而平壞地方、遂成亘古未聞之慘殺、日政府無論如何辯解、决不能辭其責任、而朝鮮總督府及一般日本新聞、尙藉口於萬寳山事件、中國壓迫鮮農、激成此舉、一似此次朝鮮暴動、其責任當田中國官吏負之者、其顚倒事實、實出情理之外、故欲研究此項事件責任之所在、第一不可不精查萬寳山事件之眞象、茲將在瀋所查萬寳山事件始末、摘要臚陳如左、</p>
<p>一肇事之原因華人郝永德組織稻田公司、租妥三姓堡蕭姓張姓之荒地五百垧、開種稻田、僱用朝鮮人、爲之工做、訂有契約、呈請長春縣政府批准、縣政府以事尙可行、須將章程界圖呈請核奪後方能照辦、又諭令僱用之韓人、不得過二十人、乃郝永德認爲已得官府允准、又轉租地於韓人沈連澤等九人耕種、招集韓人一百八十餘名、遽行開工挖灣引永、破壞民田、經過二十餘里、直至伊通河岸、人民起而反對之、阻止鮮人工做、日本領事田代、派日警前往保護韓人、不令停止工做、我方亦派警前往保護華人、此交涉之所由起也、</p>
<p>二交涉之經過長春萬寳山人民旣起阻止韓僑挖溝引水、韓人持有日警之勢力、不肯停工、當時由長春市政籌備處周處長玉柄、與日本田代領事提起交涉、斯時駐遼寗日本林總領事、來謁吉林省張主席、報告此事、張主席斯時尙未接到吉林省政府關於此案之報告、乃與林總領事口頭約定、兩方先將派警撤退、再行和平據理談判、林已允許、乃張主席命令我方、將警撤退、而日本迄未撤退、且督飭韓人進行挖溝工作益急、經周處長玉柄據理交涉、口頭書面、往返辯論、始終無效、</p>
<p>三日本方面之現狀現在韓人挖溝引水已竟工、業引水入田、日警在馬家哨口佔據民房兩所、架設軍用帳房三十九架、上懸日本國旗、並架設機關槍四架、又派馬警三人、來往巡查搜索、在馬家哨口附近四五里内、不准華人行走萬寳山附近之現狀、已似入於日本佔領地帶内之狀態、四中國方面之現狀萬寳山華人曾經一度聚衆、爲之塡平所挖水溝、經日警開槍射擊、幸無傷亡、又經我方警察勘止、靜候交涉、華人已盡散去、斯時吉林張主席、由北平返遼寗、林總領事亦由東京返遼寗、相唔後、林願將此案詳細研究、再進行交涉、張主席乃電調交涉特派員鍾毓來遼林亦電調吉林石射領事來遼、使鍾與石射當交涉之責任、現在鍾與石射、均返吉林、約在吉林或哈爾濱談判此案、但石射前曾自顧調解此事、曾提出四個條件、（一）賠償韓人損失、（二）支給韓人本年生活費、（三）許可韓人在長春自由居住、（四）省政府認可明年使韓人種稻、但此四條、已經省政府表示不能接受矣、林總領事亦曾聲明前此所提出之條件、均作罷論、</p>
<p>照以上所陳、所謂萬寳山事件者、祗有鮮人以日本勢力爲後盾、壓迫華人之事實、絕無中國官吏何等壓迫鮮農之舉動、所有日韓各報紙種種宣傳、全屬有意簧鼓、　動聽聞、此不惟中國方面衆口一詞、即日本官憲、亦未嘗不知其全非事實、如平壞道廳對於朝鮮人之公告、均聲明此種新聞多係無根之談、然則謂朝鮮事變與萬寳山事件、有原因結果之關係者、其爲無理、不辯自明、此項交涉之關鍵、日方主張一切由彼按照國内法辦理、檢舉也、預審也、防止再發也、救濟也、一切自行發動、自行辦結、而我方則主張用國際交涉、道歉也、懲兇也、保障將來也、賠償損害也、一切皆須以雙方同意行之、此中紛岐之點、全在責任問題、責任問題明了、以上各節、自可迎刄而解、照現在調查各節、此項責任、完全屬於彼方、而我方絕對無絲毫責任之可言、所有一切交涉辦法、自有國際通例、早在大部洞鑒之中、應請根據旣定方針、切實進行、以期必勝、至榮寳身膺使任、有保護僑民及增進彼此親善關係之責、茲於任國領土以内、發生此種巨變、竟致多數僑胞、無辜慘死、不能弭患事先、更使將來彼我關係、益生隔閡、有違素志、抱疚無窮、應請呈明國民政府、准予開缺、以明責任、長勝感幸之至、謹呈外交部、駐日本公使汪榮寳、（完）</p>

<p>陳道立君訊</p>
<p>我在八歲的那年、父母早已替我定了親、當時我正是個天眞爛漫的孩子、所以也没知覺、現在隨着光陰的轉瞬、我已變了一位十八歲的青年、我的父母也就此欲爲我娶親、我因現在正在學藝的時期、年齡還幼稚和不能自立的種種原因想把這事再遲延三四年、但我的父母終是不肯聽我的進告、因此我終是無法、想屆時走匿、又覺得不妥、除此之外、又别無法則、故特函煩先生、請示有何法則、可以延此婚期、或者毁這婚約、因爲我們是由媒灼的舌底蓮花說成的、誰也不知誰的面貎品性、我所曉得的、祇知道她是姓趙父親業農的、母親前幾年死了、她是個鄕下女子、從未受過敎育、……免得現在從這盲人騎瞎馬的婚姻、將來受那不善的結果、致生出（悔不當初）種種的苦楚、</p>
<p>嚴雪舫君訊</p>
<p>現在文明時代、男女平等、婚姻自由、然在這種制度之下、引起了許多青年時想離婚、去配那自已的戀人、但是終久没有得到狠好的結果近年我因受專制家庭的歷迫和那鄕下舊家庭而不識字的女子訂婚、當時我因在北京就學没有空閒和家中反對、所以被父母用專制的手段訂婚了、現在將要迎婚、我因感這種舊式女子不合做我終身伴侣、要想與他毁約、但是我的經濟常感困難、一時不能夠實現、况且他家父母也不願意和我毁約、眞使我痛苦極了、現在請求先生在貴報上指示答復吧、</p>
<p>（兩訊併覆兩訊都爲婚約問題、此事應分兩方面說、先說法律、民法第九七三條（男未滿十七歲、女未滿十五歲者、不得訂定婚約、）陳君在八歲時所訂婚約、依現行民法無效、惟施行法第四條認本條除外、嚴　說（我在北京時由父母訂婚、）按民法九七二條婚約應由當事人自行訂定、嚴君果非自己意思、也可以認爲無效、又按民法九七五條婚約不得强迫履行、在事實上與其勉强成婚、彼此終身受苦、還是解約的好、倒不單是從理論上說來、不合自由原則的關係、再說人情罷、天下無不愛子女的父母、父母所代爲選擇的、當然自己還須鄭重訪查考慮、但不應該認爲一定不行、且因此而傷父母的心、做子女的良心上倒底不安的、不過吾們也不主張馬馬虎虎地結合起來、譬如說對方没有受過敎育罷、如果單爲此點、那末不妨要求他就學、其他如果可以救濟的、應盡力想法救濟、到無可奈何時、依法辦理、青年應知自己所選的、也未必佳、嚴君說得好、（許多青年配那自己的戀人、没有得到很好的結果、）</p>
<p>陳日熹君訊</p>
<p>我對社會科學、頗喜研究、但遍購則限於經濟力在經濟緊張的現代學校、圖書館設備多不完全、少數書籍、不能滿讀書之慾、若更遠道走閱、則又耗費時間、如何可使節省經濟與時間、而得讀書之機會、幸諸先生爲我告之、</p>
<p>（覆）以一人之力、而欲徧購所欲讀的書、本不是尋常人所辦得到的、圖書館就爲欲解决這問題而設、不知君所在學校附近、還有什麽圖書館可以供給你閱讀、如果没有、或雖有而不够、還有一法、你可以在校中聨合本級、或他級同是研究社會科學的、設一讀書會、譬如十個人、每人出五元、就可購五十元的書籍、十個人輪流閱讀或舊有的書籍、一起拿來公共閱讀、就彷彿以五元的代價而得讀五十元、或并不止五十元的書籍、旣省金錢、更得切磋的利益和快樂、你想這種方法行不行、陳松梁君訊</p>
<p>我自十七年小學畢業後、父母命我入兌換小錢莊爲學徒、三年爲期、津貼膳金一百八十元、至今已屆滿期、將欲易業、回想三年内、所學之經騐、不過能辦别鈔票銀洋毫角而已、賬情則完全不懂、因小錢莊賬目均由老　自理、學徒從不過目、雖平日常看簿記書籍、但各業景况不同、現在正進退維谷之際、祈爲解决辦法、乞於報端答覆、</p>
<p>（覆）三年小錢莊得到騐幣的經騐以外、一定還熟悉商業習慣、和一切人情世故、平日還能留心看簿記書籍、有這種好學的精神、君的前途大有希望、只是千萬不宜輕易改業、吾們想來、還是從銀錢本業上覓條出路、較爲合理、學習旣然期滿、如果得到一個起碼職員、地位不嫌其低、你眞能狠努力的服務、再從服務餘暇、想法補習或自修本業所應具的知識和技能、一步一步地上進、是不難的事、陳君呀、你們無錫的麵粉大王榮氏弟兄、不是從小錢莊出身的麽、希望你大大的努力、</p>

<p>— 南宫生</p>
<p>邇來萬寳山案件。尙未解决。青島國粹會。又與國人尋釁。日人之野心。於此可見。日人在青島。經營頗力。儼然以殖民地視之。故日人所主持之報紙。有以青島重租與日本之謬議。國人宜亟起注意。而戢其野心也。</p>
<p>青島初租於德意志。日人乘歐戰之時。攘爲己有。其後逼於華盛頓會議。不得意歸諸我國。然膠濟路權。尙在日人之手。全埠之精華。亦被日人盡移他去。在日人戰勝德軍竊政之後。至歸我國時。攘爲己有。其後逼於華盛頓會議。不得意歸諸我國。然膠濟路權。尙在日人之手。全埠之精華。亦被日人盡移他去。在日人戰勝德軍竊政之後。至歸我國時。歷數載。數載之中。日人之移居於青島者。共十萬以上。一切商業。無不操諸日人之手。商店之多。爲任何一所不及。若在島上之高地。引領四望。惟見矮屋如櫛。木屐聲喧。皆日人所築之屋也。</p>
<p>日人所經營之商業。百業俱備。即戲院妓寓。亦皆齊備。青島最繁華之區。以山東路（今改中山路）及四方路。而以山東路爲第一。所有商店。日人主持者居其大半。若御菓子吳服料理等。觸目皆是。日文市招。無處無之。大約經十丈之遥。即能見日人所設之肆。青島之日人。所購百物。必在日人所設之肆。故營業頗盛。亦可見日人愛國之心。國人遠非其比。山東路外。復有所謂日本區者。在大鮑島西南。所有房屋。無一非日本式。商店無一非日人所設。其中料理介紹所妓院咖啡室尤多。店内所雇店員。亦爲日女。縱目四視。儼然入日本國境。日人之視爲殖民地地宜矣。</p>
<p>青島菜市。會集於小菜塲。其中日人所設之菜肆。較之華人。成二與一之比。蓋塲分三樓。第一與策二兩樓。中日各半。三樓則無一非日人之肆。皆售玩物。華人購買者勘衆。聞一年漏巵。逹三十萬。於此可見日人之侵略。雖細小如一玩具。尙如此之巨。可不懼哉。</p>
<p>日人在青島握政之時。全島遍植其國花櫻花。若第一公園神廟。及其餘之五公園。植櫻數萬株。每屆二三月間。雪白爛熳。日人仍倡櫻花節。屆時全市日人。如痴如狂。彷彿在其國中各處遍設攤肆。又爲日人之一大營業區。</p>
<p>日人在青島之商業。可稱無微不至。即一質肆。亦無處非日人之資本。以國人懼軍人之勢力。不敢設質肆。日人乃取而代之。子利之重。無與倫比。每元逹七分之巨。貧乏之民。不得不飲鴆止渴。忍痛往質。且期限只兩月。於是日人之獲利累累。咸爲國人汗血之資也。</p>

<p>近來歐西各國。科學之進步。大足驚人。而最近美國方而。又有有聲信件之發明。所謂有聲信件者。即可傳眞。又可傳音。男女青年。皆用以投寄情書。此事轟動一時。而紐約城内。尤爲熱閙。寄信之人。入一小室。向顯微音機發言。較短之信。一分半鐘足矣。如信件較長。則時間亦依次放長。發音時。先見緑燈之光。開始發音。旋見白燈光。則爲表示時間將到。僅餘二十秒矣。見紅燈而停止談話。至於所紀語言。則用金鋼鑽劃成紋路。使其傳眞。目前紐約市内投寄此種信件之機關凡六處。寄信之人日見繁多。除青年男女用以投寄情書面外。其他各界。如商人訂貨。牧師傳敎等。凡遇緊急時。亦用以傳遞或報告消息。便利無比。惟此種機器。發明未久。且寄信之人。設不諳科學。亦不便投寄。故尙未普遍云。</p>

<p>— 蟄存</p>
<p>曩客淮揚軍署。有役必從　筆征塵。極水陸奔馳之苦。大江南北。及運河兩岸。足迹幾徧。馬棚灣與清水潭相距約七八里。中有鐵牛灣。予曾數過其地。多喜徘徊瞻眺於其旁鐵牛形類常牛。屈四蹄伏於地。昻首向右。若有所顧。邵伯鎭關帝廟之右。亦有鐵牛一。狀與鐵牛灣之牛略同。洪澤湖邊。屬高良澗附近。有鐵牛九。每相距一二里。俗呼爲九牛灣。予之姊丈鄧君家在湖邊。爲河工會委員。予因得親見九處鐵牛。然均莫明其安置之義。詢之士土人。或云鐵牛以驅怪。當日許眞羣追捕水怪時。曾騎一神牛。怪見眞君即駭走。遥見有牛臥於堤上。仍欵眞君在其處。即奔竄不敢稍停或又云。水不得過牛鼻。騐之信然。每見羣牛雖渡大河。鼻均昻出水外。鑄牛所以示　鎭之法。相傳如此。未知孰是。予按高家堰。曾爲元人所掘决。其時欵朱太祖赴裏下河。計以淹没之。水直抵蘇州閶門。淮揚各郡縣均成汪洋。嗣水漸退。鹽阜東興各縣居民。俱係由蘇遷來。挿草爲標。分地種植。朱明定鼎。修築高家堰時。劉青田先生曾巡視一周。相度形勢。各處鐵牛。均爲青田所鑄。擇地安頓之。其取義當爲鎭壓水患無疑。本年水災如此之巨。爲百年來所未見。各處鐵牛。能否有限制水患之效力。不可得而知矣。</p>

<p>— 艾艾自東京寄</p>
<p>東京的夏天</p>
<p>火一般的太陽。籠罩着無邊的大地。這是窮人們受難的季節。這是資產階級者安閒休暇的時期。避暑兩個字。在我們國内。似乎是逹官富商所專有的名辭。他們携着美妾嬌妻。卜居在莫干山上。北戴河邊。雪　調冰。逍遥地過着風凉的歲月。那些被烈日晒得像醬鴨般的農夫。在高逹度工廠裏流汗的兄弟。在烽火連天的戰塲上拼命的士兵們。他們是倒夢也不曾想在這炎炎的夏日。還另外有一個清凉的世界。</p>
<p>在日本。情形便有些不同。他們對於海濱避暑這件事。是絕端的平民化。也許可以說日本人的避暑。是暑期中求生活緊縮的一種變像。因爲近海各地。平日以處境冷落。人口密度較稀。生活程度比都市中要便宜三分之一。因之住在都市中的市民。有遷居的可能性者。大都在這長夏期中。往海濱住上二三月。一則可以籍海水浴鍛練身心。二則可以减省生活的消費。日本人的家庭是最簡單不過的。他們星宇的陳設。旣没有檯凳衣橱眠床這一顆的笨重傢俱。所以旅行起來。說走就走。二三箱篋。隨身與俱。是不感受什麽因難的。待得秋凉時候。鴻雁歸來。他們也就重新遷回都市。這樣的攘往熙來。已經成了大多數人的通常習慣。</p>
<p>那些屬於職務不能遠遊的人呢。不是太煩燥太辛勞麽。正爲着這箇。各大公司的社會事業部。花着成千整萬的欵子。選擇名勝之區。分别地創辦着納凉會。以供一般市民的娱樂。街頭貼滿了花花緑緑的帶着藝術色彩的廣告。他們是竭誠地在歡迎着遊人。這種組織。都是純粹的義務性質。對於參加的遊客。並無須破費分文。</p>
<p>今年的納凉會。辦得最精彩的。要算上野松坂屋首屈一指了。他們别出心裁。將整箇的屋頂花園。裝成寒冬景象。園中周圍上下。都配有活動佈景。淡灰色的天空。紛紛地降着鵝掌大的白雪。小池裏的水。凍成了厚冰。有用雪堆成的獅子。有用雪塑成的美人裸體模型。舉目四望。但見玉宇瓊樓。一片白色。小島兒吱吱喳喳地在枝頭做着啄雪遊戲。年青的女郎們扮着冬天的裝飾。衝寒踏雪歌舞在舖着白色天鵝絨地毯的大自然中。一切的一切。都點綴得情景逼眞。逼眞。彷彿是眞的冬天已經到了一樣。園中有電影。有戲劇。有跳舞。有滑稽漫談。都可隨意入場。不收門票。松坂屋之外。隅田公園。日比谷公園芝公園兩國館也都有納凉會的組織。或是預備着無數的划船。任憑遊客們在緑波中蕩漾。或是演着卓别靈的笑片和熱情女郎克萊拉寳傑作。每到夕陽西下。各處都擠滿了遊人。提琴家奏着雄壯悲凉的音樂。詼諧者嬴得了無限的笑聲。妙舞輕歌。直待到夜靜更闌。方才盡興歸去。祇是我們這些在日本作客的人。看着他人的興高彩烈。回顧祖國那些流離失所的同胞。總覺得傷心人别有懷抱。說來無任凄然。</p>

<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>西涯</p>
<p>納蘭客若渌水亭雜識稱明李文正東陽賜第在西長安門西。俗呼李閣老胡同。其别業在北安門北。北安門即地安門。俗稱後門。門外即十刹海。由此淡沱綿延以至積水潭。爲玉泉泉水入城停蓄處。方元代全盛時。此水當城之西。南來漕艘。由通惠河穿城而入。匯聚此潭。牙牆錦纜。排闖駢闐。殆如天寳時唱三郎得寳歌故事。明代縮小城垣。漕艘在城東起倉。此地淪爲烟水。遂使帝城一角。可興江湖萬里之思。宜文正留連於此。垂爲名蹟也。文正懷麓堂集有西涯十二首西涯在慈恩寺後公即取以自號。蓋公祖業在此。非别業。容若偶誤也。十二首。一海子。二西山三慈恩寺。四響閘。五飲馬池。六楊柳灣。七鐘鼓樓。八桔橰亭。九稻田。十蓬池。十一菜園。十二廣福觀。皆積水潭至十刹海一帶之景也。嘉慶中法梧門重訪西涯故居。爰倩羅兩峯繪續西涯十二圖。一時名流題詠盈册姨丈黄再同侍講嘗手摹一通余於兩寅之冬假諸其家。亦臨數紙。黄詩有云。西涯本是元西海。（積水潭印元西海子。）妙繪清吟各幾回。（西涯作圖始沈石田文衡山。梧門詩龕凡五十餘圖。予所見已十餘圖。嘉慶中老輩題詠極多。）居士龕還更第宅。相公地本乏樓臺。（西涯是李文正公祖業。初無别墅。故文正詩有緑野無堂正憶裝之句。詳見梧門西涯考。）前朝山色猶城上。大雅風流去水隈。松樹藜光途漸熟。花時約及每同來。余追和一首云。承平清暇人如接。圖畫追摹首重回。南望好吟懷麓集。東風已失國花臺。迷離坊曲荒烟裏。蕭瑟園林野水隈。多恐昔賢名姓幾人郊墓讀碑來。</p>
<p>文正墓在西直門外畏吾村。與極樂寺相近。寺以海棠擅名。有國花臺。今臺雖在而樹已荒。村名亦改。余於癸亥春間。偕方御驂策蹇過訪。曲折尋問。始得其處。故有此詩末聨也。今積水潭一帶。烟水空明。鷗鳬葭薍。蕭然有波澤之致。臨水人家。時聞砧杵。尤與時代隔絕。舊京高士。孤蹝獨往。每愛結廬是間。無錫許溯伊即卜築於此。臨流壘石。移竹成援。夏晚小集賓朋。　然意遠。余嘗以句寫其景云。烟濛官柳無窮碧。雨出遥山不斷青。猶不若宋牧仲之過銀錠橋舊居詩尤爲工切。宋詩云鼓樓西接後湖灣。銀錠橋横夕照間。不盡滄波連太液。依然晴翠送遥山。舊時院落松槐在。仙境笙簧歲月閒。白首鍊師茶話久。春風料峭暮鴉還。</p>
<p>積水潭迤南至十刹海。有稻田數畝。城市中得此。景尤奇絕。桔橰咿啞。宛在江南。長隄一桁。官柳覆之。夾岸蘆棚冰擔。喧闐里許。滿洲土士女。濃妝炫服。嬉游其間比年以來。舊京風俗漸改昔觀。惟此間猶存春明夢餘景象。北岸有酒樓曰會賢堂。亦純舊式。憑闌俯視。全景在目。把酒遐思。直如南渡後人追想汴京繁華也。</p>

<p>全書分三卷、首卷（南洋行）（事緣嶺南男子、有南洋之行、將别井離鄕、放洋南渡、女子對之、不覺傷神、於是在别離時、各訴其苦、不覺言之衷切而成爲歌詞、）……計分三篇共百首、第二卷、爲普通男女唱答情歌、分細話衰情、她的意中人、載離載合、交情話、斷情話、奇妙的同名、質疑、戲、等篇、共百首第三卷亦爲普通男女唱答情歌、分難舍難分、十八答、愛情與金錢、專戀與多戀、老翁與少婦、舉子别妻、萬里尋未兒孫夢、韓江一瞥、約守秘密、春光外泄、問難、通訊、贈物、結婚的標記、戀愛與痛苦、迹芳、送行、謔等二十餘篇、共一百首、有的前面附有說明、歌中的詞句有爲士語不易　者、皆有國語註釋、旣保存歌謡的本來面目、復能使人一看瞭然、編者的苦心、我們不能不體息稱道、</p>
<p>全卷中旣屬歌謡、且係情歌、當然不免有鄙俗、甚或猥褻之嫌、然而是眞情流露、是態度誠懇、有不得不唱出來可以斷言、僅此一點、在前面說過、已不失爲好的文學作品的資格、况其中還有許多詞句錚鏘、意義深刻、譬喻恰切的嗎、</p>
<p>除此、民欲情歌中藴藏著許多爲研究歷史、語言、人類、社會學……的資料、如當地的民情、風俗、習慣、及人民心理等也是最有價值的、例如本書第二卷（她意中的情人）、我們可以知鄕村婦女、是不歡迎讀書的人作她底（黑漆板凳）、却歡迎粗魯的種田老、與現在磨登女郎希望愛人是什麽博士碩士、恰正相反、理由是、</p>
<p>嫁郎莫嫁讀書郎、</p>
<p>一年四季守空房、</p>
<p>不如嫁個耕田佬、</p>
<p>我我卿卿有商量、</p>
<p>因敵不住性的苦悶、而思有解决之、嘗越禮敎、犯法律、置毁譽生死於不顧、眞正爲愛情而犧牲的婦女也有、如第一卷五·一篇（妻大夫小）、第三卷中（春光外泄）等篇中女主角所唱的就是這一類、</p>
<p>講到三角的戀愛故事也有、如第三卷（專戀與多變）一篇便是、祗是這裏他或她都很坦白地在舊情人面前說出新情人來、他們忠誠·老實·没有虚僞的態度、比之現在青年鬼鬼崇崇、瞞上瞞下、眞是高明可敬多了、</p>
<p>總之、本書中除歌詞有欣賞的價值外、把廣東平遠等一帶地方社會情形也給我們知道了不少、近來我國民族主義文藝已佔領了整個中國文壇、所謂民族主義、即是發揮中華民族固有的活潑、勇敢、奮鬥的精神、反抗帝國主義、振興全民族的意識的文藝、那麽、無疑的、對於這十分刻劃了民族性的民間文學像本書一類作品、我們實有注意的必要、本文即根據這點作結論、將本書介紹於大衆、</p>

<p>— 阿梅</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>站在孟淵旅館的門口、目送着婉芬的影子在浙江路的轉角消失了、他想到事情太如意、</p>
<p>一小時以前、婉芬讓他有了肉麻心躍的機會、她說、</p>
<p>（阿林、你那位女同學、還時常代你嗎、）</p>
<p>（她爲什麽要時常找我呢、恐怕有工夫還去陪她愛人去玩呢、）</p>
<p>（你不是她的愛人嗎、）婉芬這句話像剌透了他的心、阿林臉紅了、</p>
<p>（婉芬、）阿林牽起了她的手、（爲什麽你也說這樣的話、我的心你不認識嗎）</p>
<p>（哼、你太認眞了、你不能明白我說的是笑話、）</p>
<p>（婉芬、由此我却證明你愛我的深確了、多少你這所謂笑話的意義是含有保護我的勇氣的、）</p>
<p>（世界上我最愛的人是你想想吧、阿林、假使你從我手裏跑出去、我的生活没有了、我怎能不時刻的留神你呢、）</p>
<p>被感動到抱着這女人接一個長吻也不盡謝意的、阿林流了涙、</p>
<p>（阿林、你的錢還没有匯到嗎、）</p>
<p>（唉、該死、我把這事情忘了、給你、）</p>
<p>女人把鈔票接過去、說、</p>
<p>（今天晚上、我們到明園去玩玩好不好、）</p>
<p>臉上略然帶了踟踯的神色、婉芬明白了他的意思、</p>
<p>（假使你今天没有工夫、明天到月宫去也好、）</p>
<p>（十一點鐘吧、你等我、眞是、這幾天眞想跳舞了、）</p>
<p>彼此相依戀的、但究於說再會了、</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>（我想你出去了、來得太遲了、家裏有回信嗎、）</p>
<p>逸珍拉開了屋門、就如此搶着說了、</p>
<p>（哎、家裏的人們眞該死、我眞奇怪做父母的不能體諒兒女的心、他們說、無論如何不能解除婚約、）</p>
<p>（那麽你要怎樣解决呢、）</p>
<p>（同家裏斷絕關係、）</p>
<p>（可是經濟上有問題呀、縱然不再念書、可是找工作也不見得容易、）</p>
<p>阿林没有回答、女人的話又接下去了、）應許我的兩本書怎樣了、</p>
<p>（呵、對不起、可是也因爲家裏没有錢寄誰、）</p>
<p>阿林吃驚非常、但女人早從桌上把那手帕拿起來了、手帕角上的婉芬兩個字、使逸珍明白了這愛人近來的行爲、她没有說什麽、</p>
<p>（預備送給你、）阿林這樣說、</p>
<p>（那麽原諒我不說謝了、）</p>
<p>女人說完這話、想走、男的是敷衍的留她、</p>
<p>（你竟是這樣瞎纏、難道我在這裏陪着你就是愛你嗎、）</p>
<p>（那麽、再會了、）</p>
<p>（再會、）</p>
<p>逸珍走了、阿林在這裏自慶祝着自己手腕的圓熟、</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>馬路上擠滿了囂雜、電車在柏油路上滚、商店的紅緑電燈彷彿逢人送笑、窈窕的女人、壓在行人道上、吸住了有野心的男子們的靈魂、</p>
<p>口裏含雪茄、心中無論誰都不能說你年青人不是高興的、黄包車在北四川路的道傍停住了、阿林走進了月宫、</p>
<p>在幽明的燈光下、他找不到婉芬、全塲舞動着的是五色的肉屍、人們沉醉了、舞啊、舞啊舞到疲倦的時候、他恍惚看到一個婉芬的女人向他這邊走過來了、他到後、的確知道是婉芬了、他站起來、滿心的焦急到這時像完全去掉、預備着對女人和有的歡迎的樣子、是他喊了一聲、</p>
<p>（婉芬）、</p>
<p>可是婉芬没有理他、很驕傲的看了他一眼、就撲到一個男子的懷裏坐下了、</p>
<p>他應當怎樣完滿自己所遇到的這種僵局呢、一個男子的自尊心、使阿林覺到過去同那女人理論一回無異是自尋侮辱、他只想到他是對不起逸珍、</p>
<p>思在和氣的夜風中、電燈底下走着的得意的人們不在有阿林在内了、</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>書桌上擺着兩封信、他知道家裏的一封是促他成婚、逸珍的一封無疑是找他加入什麽研究會的事、</p>
<p>可是信觀完以後、他暈倒在床上了、一切都完了、家裏說是能够自己選擇婚姻、自然個人應該有能力養活女人的、於是不能再有錢寄他了、可是逸珍的話爲什麽也那樣的堅决呢、說、</p>
<p>（……有罅隙的愛情、還是讓它破碎吧、阿林、我已然决定把一顆心移獻旁人了、……）</p>
<p>哭笑全無用、情形在各方面都失了補救、阿林眼前跳動着的只是敎訓兩個字的影子、</p>

<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>我立向潘興司令祝捷、九月十三十四和十五、我軍便在敵人手中奪回的新陣地嚴密防佈、</p>
<p>美第一軍現須把大部分的隊伍調往苗斯河之西、一顯其大好身手了、</p>
<p>前於九月二日决定美軍在九月三日進攻聖米希爾、我現令英法美三總司令向康布萊聖崑丁梅齊歐線進兵、德國横貫鐵路便近在咫尺、美軍即在苗斯河之西舉行猛攻、</p>
<p>從史家坡河以至愛斯南河聨軍的進攻、現正在順利的發展中、敵軍開始全綫退却、聨軍全部兵力遂分頭調來會攻、進攻路線如下、</p>
<p>（一）英軍以法軍掩護左翼、續向康布萊聖崑丁方面進攻、</p>
<p>（二）法軍的中路部隊驅遂敵軍退過愛斯南河愛勒特河、</p>
<p>（三）美軍（甲）在胡夫爾區域作戰、以肅清巴黎亞夫里谷鐵路綫和獲得下次進攻的出發根據地爲目標、此戰至遲須在九月十日進行、以免敵軍乘機補充實力、（乙）東面以苗斯河掩護左翼、以法第四軍爲聲援、向梅齊歐方面猛攻、此戰至遲須在九月二十至二十五之間實行、第一個目標即在亞岡河兩岸作戰把敵軍擊退至斯登内勒喜斯阿鐵尼之綫、第二個目標便爲占領梅齊歐、向東進兵以取愛斯南河、</p>
<p>我對英軍直接猛撲與登堡綫的計劃並不放棄、九月八日我便寫給海格元帥、請其（立即着手準備攻克這道防綫、以及逾過這綫向指定目的地挺進、如欲攻敵不備、則這次進攻更屬不宜延遲、）</p>
<p>翌日、九月九日、我往拉朋内覲見比王、向王陳說、現以德軍動摇、其兵力大部集中法境、我軍大可乘機擊退比境的敵軍、而克復雷斯河以北的失地、我們遂進一步討論作戰計劃、指英法兩軍掩護比軍進攻、</p>
<p>比王亞爾培對此完全贊同、我遂往加塞爾同海格元帥善勒美將軍和紀良少將會議、詳細討論並即擬定作戰計劃、</p>
<p>第一步準備出擊的根據地、以攻占克勒肯山嶺·賀塞爾森林·拜興台爾山嶺·歇魯·佛高地·朗特·渥特·康明内運河爲目標、第二步一面積極向布魯冶挺進、以肅清比利時海岸、一面向鐵爾特和堪特方面進攻、第一戰須比軍九師英軍兩師、第二戰以大部比軍部隊會同英第二軍和法步兵三師法騎兵三師担任、</p>
<p>會議結束、我即把這决議用封面通告指定作戰的各軍、</p>
<p>貝當司令自然對這些計劃也不使隔閡、我並且通知他、到必要時、我想委任狄高德將軍出馬、</p>
<p>九月十一日晨、比王駕臨朋朋、我即請他指揮比軍、指定參加作戰的英法部隊也歸他指揮、他完全同意、惟請發一正式軍令、並請派一法將領助理、狄高德將軍遂被任爲法蘭特聨軍參謀長、歸比王節制、紀良少將·海格元帥·貝當司令、均接得通知、惟對各方面堅囑嚴守秘密、</p>
<p>海格元帥對我計劃完全同意、十四日他便回答我九月八日的信道、他準備即向凡爾孟和柯熟谷間施行猛攻、以占領聖崑安運河和喜爾特河之西的敵軍防綫、而使英第四軍逹到進擊興登堡綫的地位、</p>
<p>我令狄朋尼軍長以左翼軍協助英第四軍右翼、丨這便時他今後主要和固定的作戰任務、軍令裏面這樣說、（此後法軍左翼必須常常掩護英軍四軍右翼、更須常常維持兩軍的聨絡…）、</p>
<p>九月十八日、英第四軍以法第一軍左翼和英第三軍右翼的掩護即順利的攻擊賀爾能·富勒斯諾·哈奇谷·勒皮爾·柯熟谷之綫、指定的目標一一逹到、生擒俘虜萬餘人、奪獲大砲一百五十門、尤其重要的戰績就是我軍現已進展至攻擊興登堡綫的陣地了、更因海格元帥準備向聖崑丁至康布萊一段的興登堡綫指揮主力攻擊、故此役結果尤關重要、</p>
<p>海帥即以此爲目標立即佈置、九月二十二日、他向英第一第三第四各軍下令準備向興登堡綫總攻、總攻日期他當時雖仍未通知部下、但他心裏已决定在二十五日左右開始、</p>
<p>英軍總司令把他的計劃通知貝當司令、並請立即增援法第一軍、尤其砲隊方面、貝當司令即從後備軍團的中路抽調、因（這路暫時並不預備有何重要戰事）、過去兩月間的進展使後備軍團的戰綫縮短不少、貝當司令抽調援軍便輕而易舉、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Central Government Has Concrete Measures for the Gansu Incident <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>National Government Orders the Arrest of Ma Wenche</p>
<p>Accomplices to Be Exempted from Investigation</p>
<p>A certain quarter in Nanjing received a telegram from Lanzhou stating that Ma Wenche felt extremely uneasy after receiving Chiang Kai-shek's telegram ordering him to take responsibility for investigating the Gansu affair. Lei Zhongtian also regretted being exploited. Ma Hongbao resides in Li Chaojie's residence and is very safe. After Chiang returned to Nanjing, he repeatedly summoned Ma Fuxiang to inquire about his</p>
<p>opinions on handling the Gansu matter. Ma Fuxiang stated that he had no preconceived notions and would listen to the central government's decisions in order to avoid the suspicion of monopolizing Gansu's politics. The central government has made concrete decisions on the handling measures and will announce them soon. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>After the Gansu incident occurred in Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Ma Wenche, the chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee, ordering him to report the true situation of the incident as soon as possible. Ma has not complied. Now, the National Government has telegraphed Lei Zhongtian, Gao Zhenbang, and others to arrest Ma Wenche and ordered the restoration of Ma Hongbin's freedom as chairman of the province, allowing him to preside over provincial affairs as usual. All other accomplices are to be exempted from investigation. At the same time, telegrams were sent to the provincial governments of Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, etc., and to Chen Guizhang, Lu Dachang, etc., for notification. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yang Hucheng in Nanjing telegraphed Ma Fuxiang from Tongguan, stating, "I have just received a winter telegram from the Commander-in-Chief stating that Yang Hucheng is responsible for mediating the Gansu matter. First, order Lei and others to restore Ma Hongbin's freedom." Cheng immediately strictly ordered adherence to the central government's prestige, etc. Upon investigation, Cheng immediately strictly ordered a halt to the Gansu incident, forbidding any defiance of the central government or unauthorized detention of border officials. Now, as per the previous order, in addition to strictly telegraphing Lei Zhongtian, Ma Wenche, and others to comply and strictly prohibiting the advance of troops, I believe this matter should be easily resolved. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui in Nanjing sent his representative, Ma Rulong, to Nanjing to meet with key figures of the central government to report that the Gansu incident was not a conflict between Han and Hui people. (Sixth Day Telegram)</p>
<p>People from Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces residing in Nanjing held a meeting at the Gansu-Qing-Ning Guild Hall on the sixth day to discuss the current Gansu incident. They all agreed that it was a political problem that should be resolved by the central government. As for the disorder in Gansu's public security, it was entirely due to the massacres by the bandit troops of Ma Tingxian, Ma Zhongying, and others. Therefore, those responsible for suppressing bandits like Ma Tingxian should be sympathized with, while those who harbor them are enemies of the Gansu people and should be unanimously opposed. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lu Dachang in Beiping telegraphed his representative in Beiping, He Shixiong, declaring his obedience to the central government, with his troops stationed in their original defenses, and Ma Wenche temporarily in charge of Gansu's politics. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing considers Ningxia an important town in the Northwest, and its political affairs cannot be left without a leader. He has telegraphed the newly appointed provincial chairman, Ma Hongkui, to quickly lead his troops to assume office and not delay any longer. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Chiang Plans to Go to Wuhan Again <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>To Establish a Provisional Headquarters in Hunan If Necessary</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing plans to go to Wuhan this week to inspect the situation. If necessary, he may need to go to Changsha to establish a provisional headquarters. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing plans to go to Wuhan again around the tenth of this month to inspect the defense situation in Hubei and Hunan. The plan to inspect the flood disaster in Jiangbei seems to have been abandoned. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing will not go to Jiangbei to inspect the flood disaster for the time being due to the complexity of political affairs. He will leave Nanjing after the tenth to go to Hubei and Jiangxi to supervise the suppression of the Red bandits. (Sixth Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>After news of the entry of Guangdong and Guangxi troops into Hunan spread in Nanjing, rumors were rampant. A certain important figure in the capital telegraphed Hunan to inquire. Yesterday, he received a reply telegram from Ling Zhang, the secretary-general of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, stating, "I have received your telegram. Guangdong and Guangxi are plotting against Hunan, using both enticements and threats, stopping at nothing. However, He Jian and the generals in Hunan support the central government and obey Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek consistently. Do not believe the provocations of treacherous people." Furthermore, He Jian telegraphed on the fifth day, "I have completed my inspection of the disaster areas along the Hunan River and will return to Changsha." (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chiang Has Not Abandoned His Advocacy for Peace with Guangdong <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing stated regarding the Guangdong situation that he has not abandoned his advocacy for compromise and peace as of now. However, since Guangdong has telegraphed its intention to send troops, he has no choice but to increase defenses in Hunan and Jiangxi for the sake of protecting the territory. All training orders to mobilize the various divisions mostly take a defensive posture and do not contain an offensive attitude. Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang on the fifth, also</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>including this intention, to show that the central government has not abandoned its long-standing desire for peace. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to information from a certain consulate in Nanjing, Guangzhou's diplomatic policy has been decided as "alliance with Japan, opposition to Germany, and resistance to Britain." After achieving a situation of self-preservation, the policy will be changed and the alliance with Japan will be terminated. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to information from a certain quarter in Nanjing, the central government believes that the Guangdong matter can be resolved peacefully and has telegraphed Li Shizeng, Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, and others to come to Nanjing for thorough discussions.

<p>According to foreign information in Nanjing, the US wheat loan contract can be signed by Rong Kui ten days ago. The government's full power of attorney has been sent by telegram. Because the acting ambassador has no full powers and authority, an additional order has been issued. It is also rumored that someone from Guangdong in the United States is trying to sabotage the wheat flour loan with a very strange reason, claiming that it (may be used as military rations). It is hoped that the US side, based on the principle of disaster relief and compassion, will not change its mind halfway and leave the disaster-stricken people in the lurch.

The Central Army has repeatedly captured famous cities. All cities have government troops stationed. There are scattered bandits in the various villages and towns, but they no longer dare to openly resist the army. The 200,000 troops in Jiangxi Province are sufficient to suppress the local area and have a surplus. They are currently engaged in mop-up operations. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Recognize the Environment, Recognize Responsibility <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully Advise University Students Nationwide</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the two months of summer vacation have slipped away. Schools across the country are now successively announcing the start of the new academic year. Students in each school are also about to follow the usual practice of carrying bags, paying fees, and entering school to begin their new academic year of study. However, the start of this academic year is different from past years. It has another serious meaning. Students, especially university students, should not easily take a step into the school gate. Before entering the school, they should take a look and recognize the serious environment around them, and especially earnestly recognize the responsibility they should bear in the serious environment.</p>
<p>How serious is the current environment? Devastating floods, unseen in a century, have affected 16 provinces and regions, with 100 million disaster victims still struggling in the vast floods. Countless houses have been lost, and countless people have drowned. The Yangtze River basin, known as the prosperous region of our country, has been swept by the ruthless floods into a vast ocean. The country's vitality has been greatly damaged. This great calamity is truly a major turning point related to the survival and future of our country and nation. Secondly, the eastern neighbor Japan's aggression against our Northeast mainland has recently become even more active and aggressive. They forcibly reclaimed paddy fields in Wanbaoshan and instigated Korean people to create anti-Chinese massacres. These two cases have been pending unresolved until now, and their aggressive situation continues to intensify. The coming years do not allow for optimism. During this short summer vacation, internal and external troubles have come together, and the country's situation has undergone a sudden change. The nation's vitality is like a thread. It is difficult to hope for salvation even with the strength of all our people to mourn the dead, rescue the living, and resist the strong. The seriousness of the environment is more serious than this. The urgency of the situation is more urgent than this.</p>
<p>University students have received higher education and are the elite of our country today and the pillars of tomorrow. Since the current situation and environment of our country are so serious, the responsibilities that university students bear are even more arduous. How to revitalize our country and how to revive our nation? The pivot of fortune and misfortune, survival and destruction, is tied to the hands of university students. That is to say, university students should shoulder the responsibility in the current serious environment, and how arduous is it?</p>
<p>Then, how should you earnestly shoulder this arduous responsibility? The answer is: Fulfill your responsibility today, which is also the way to shoulder the responsibility tomorrow. Your current responsibility is to study. To study in order to put it to use, you should deeply understand the difficulty of the current situation and always take the revitalization of the country and the revival of the nation as your own responsibility. Those who are indulging in romantic debauchery should sweep away their bad habits. Those who are pursuing movies and dances should abandon their hobbies. With the spirit of desperately killing the enemy on the battlefield, strive for knowledge, train your body and mind, and strengthen your will. Knowledge must be practical, and action must be practical. Determine your goals and move forward. If you can obtain real knowledge today, you can truly apply it to society and the country in the future. You can shoulder the great responsibility of revitalizing the country and reviving the nation in the future. If the psychological reform is followed by action, the nation's progress may still be hopeful. If you continue to be lax and accumulate bad habits without change, do not seek practical learning, do not move when a great disaster is coming, and do not take action when death is near, then there will be no dawn in the dark future, and can the country's future still be asked? This is what university students should deeply realize, deeply contemplate, and deeply awaken to in today's serious environment.</p>
<p>What is even more important is that the number of universities and vocational schools in our country, according to the statistics published by the Ministry of Education this year, is only 34 universities and 16 vocational schools. There are only 12,285 university students and 2,168 vocational students. If we take the total population of China as 450 million, there is only one university student in 31,135 people and one university in 9 million people. To have the opportunity to receive a university education in the huge number of 31,135 people is truly no different from being the chosen one. Then, how should we value this opportunity and use this opportunity to not live up to this opportunity? The country spends huge sums of money on one person every year, and the family spends huge sums of money on one person every year. This heavy amount of money is the blood and sweat of most of the 31,135 compatriots. Taking the blood and sweat of the public to provide for one person to study, then, how should we strive to be worthy of the country, the public, and the family? To go a step further, this year's flood disaster has caused a tragic calamity for 100 million disaster victims. Those who died are exposed, and those who live are displaced, unable to eat or keep warm. However, university students can still hold huge expenses and go to school with peace of mind, and the society is still trying to support the schools to maintain their normal operations. If they still do not feel alarmed and rise up to strive not to live up to the public and not to live up to the society, they are truly without heart and lungs and are truly sinners of society.</p>
<p>We dare to respectfully advise university students: A great disaster is at hand, as dangerous as a pile of eggs. The hope of the country and the nation's future is tied to your bodies. Recognize the current environment and recognize the difficult and arduous responsibilities of the future.</p>

<p>Anti-Chinese Sentiment Only Temporarily Eased</p>
<p>Property Losses Exceed Ten Million in Gold</p>
<p>A dispatch from Phoenix on the 5th reported that an increasing number of overseas Chinese from Sonora and Sinaloa states in Mexico arrived at the American border today. They all stated that the anti-Chinese sentiment was only temporarily eased, and after this period, the Anti-Chinese Committee would resume its activities, so they were all eager to return home. It is said that in recent weeks, grocery stores, restaurants, and other shops opened by overseas Chinese have been confiscated by the Mexican authorities on the pretext of non-compliance with the law, or forced to be abandoned, or sold off at very low prices. The value of their business assets totals at least US$10 million. Currently, the governors of the two states have promised to send officials to protect overseas Chinese, but it is generally believed that the laws excluding overseas Chinese will not be repealed. The "80% Mexican Employee" law, which triggered the expulsion of overseas Chinese, is only temporarily suspended and is unlikely to be repealed. Moreover, overseas Chinese in Mexico have suffered discrimination due to China's weak national power, such as being forced to pay unfair taxes and being fined heavily for minor offenses. Their plight is difficult to describe. The reason given by the Mexicans is that during this time of economic decline, Mexicans are unemployed, and due to the business recession in the United States, many Mexicans who had emigrated to the United States have returned home and are even more unemployed. Overseas Chinese have a dominant position in Mexican commerce, and even the larger Chinese shops often do not employ Mexicans, making it impossible to absorb the unemployed Mexicans. In view of this, it seems that Mexicans are engaged in economic competition and will not stop until they have excluded overseas Chinese, who have no national power to back them up. Therefore, none of these people intend to stay in Mexico any longer and are eager to return home. For the past week, American immigration officials have been very busy checking certificates, bonds, etc. Several hundred overseas Chinese have also tried to enter the United States illegally and have all been detained and sent back to their home country. Private charities and Mexican consular officials have provided a large amount of assistance to incoming overseas Chinese who have no travel expenses.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Washington on the 5th reported that due to the huge deficit in the US Treasury, President Hoover, fearing that increasing taxes would affect the Republican Party in next year's presidential election, today ordered the Budget Office to implement severe austerity measures and reduce all expenditures to the bare minimum. In July and August alone, due to the sharp decline in income tax and other tax revenues, the Treasury had a deficit of $396,365,000. If efforts are not made to reduce government spending, the Treasury deficit for this fiscal year may be twice that of last year.</p>

This committee will investigate the policies toward China and Manchuria and Mongolia and will coordinate with various civil groups to ensure the flawless implementation of Japan's China policy. However, Prime Minister Wakatsuki and the party executives believe that while the infringement of Japanese rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia by China should be dealt with decisively, a pragmatic resolution should be sought from the perspective of the future of China and Japan and international relations, rather than recklessly resorting to force as advocated by some. They strongly advocated self-restraint and warned party members against rash actions.</p>

Now, France and Italy have suddenly notified Britain that they are withdrawing from the competition, citing inadequate preparation, and forfeiting their participation guarantees of £4,500 each. British newspapers were surprised that France and Italy, who had proposed the competition earlier than Britain, now claimed that they were inadequately prepared. British aircraft have made many sacrifices during training, incurring considerable expense. Although the guarantee money has been forfeited, it is far from compensating for the losses. Furthermore, the airplane race has been held twice before, and British aircraft have won both times. If they win again this year, the Schneider Trophy will belong to Britain.</p>

<p>Sino-Russian Conference Divided Into Two Parts for Discussion</p>
<p>The Results of the Road Redemption and Eastern Railway Management Law Have Not Yet Been Obtained. Harbin Correspondent: Liu Zerong, a specialist committee member of the Sino-Russian Conference, left Russia on August 23rd to attend to personal matters and returned to China. He arrived in Harbin on the morning of the first of this month. Traveling in the same car were delegation secretary Wu Zesheng and clerk Dai Yunzhang. The car was delayed en route and arrived at the station at 7:45 AM. Acting Director-General of the Eastern Railway, Li Shaogeng, Director Shen Ruilin, Russian Director-General Kuznetsov, and Director Danilevsky all went to the station to welcome him. Yesterday, Liu visited various parties and was extremely busy. The reporter interviewed him at the Council on the afternoon of the 2nd. The conversation was as follows: (Question) Are you returning to Tianjin to report to Representative Mo Quanxian? (Answer) My return to China is to attend to personal matters. I have taken a month's leave and will return to Russia when my leave expires. I am not carrying any official mission. (Question) The news of the recent Sino-Russian Conference has been quite quiet. What is the situation? (Answer) Rumors that Representative Mo Quanxian had asked for leave to return home and that the conference had been suspended are not true. The conference is still proceeding as usual and has been held more than twenty times. It is divided into two parts for discussion: one part is the road redemption issue, and the other part is the revision of the Eastern Railway Management Law. (Question) What is the current progress of the road redemption issue? (Answer) Both sides have proposed outlines for this issue and must discuss them within this scope. How to estimate the price, what method to use for redemption, what currency to use as the redemption price, whether to pay in installments or in a lump sum, all need to be discussed and decided. After the principles are approved, they will be submitted to the Eastern Railway Group Special Committee for detailed study. However, due to the complexity of the relationship, it cannot be decided in a short time, so there are no results yet. The Special Committee has not yet convened. (Question) Is it true that the redemption price has been agreed upon? (Answer) This is a matter for the future and not the time to talk about it. Rumors that Russia is asking for a certain amount and we are offering a certain amount are completely unfounded. (Question) How is the Eastern Railway Management Law being discussed? (Answer) The Eastern Railway Management Law proposal is a temporary measure to maintain joint management of the railway before the road redemption is properly arranged. Because both sides feel that there are unsatisfactory points in the current railway system, and the road redemption cannot be decided for a while, even if it is decided, there must be a period during which both sides must maintain railway operations. This transitional measure is the Eastern Railway Management Law that is currently being discussed. Both sides have proposals, but they mostly concern the outstanding cases of the railway over the years. The discussion has not yet been completed. (Question) What is Russia's attitude towards road redemption? Does it agree with our proposal? (Answer) Russia's attitude seems to be not different. This is because the Sino-Russian and Soviet-Russian agreements all stipulate that China is allowed to raise the issue of road redemption at any time. Now that we have raised it, Russia has no way to refuse. (Question) How are the gentlemen of the delegation doing recently? (Answer) All is well. However, there are few houses and many people in Moscow, and the offices are too small. There are no suitable places to be found outside, so some of the staff are still living on the train. (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Third International's Conspiracy with Soviet Russia <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Truth of the Noulens Case Endangers China</p>
<p>Related Documents Have Been Released Sequentially</p>
<p>Beijing News. Since the Shanghai Public Concession police cracked the Noulens case, a major Communist Party offender who endangered China, Chinese and foreign individuals have been eager to learn the details of this case. However, due to the multitude of documents and complex language, the process of organizing and translating them has taken considerable time. Now, after joint review and organization by the Kuomintang Central Organization Department's Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the results can be gradually released to allow Chinese and foreign individuals to understand the truth of this case together.</p>
<p>China, a country with backward production, not only lacks the subjective conditions for a proletarian revolution but also has no objective possibility whatsoever. The Third International is fully aware of this. It merely uses the banner of "world revolution" to conceal its hideous face of invading weak nations. It is fully aware that it is not easy to realize so-called Leninism in economically backward colonial countries, such as India, and capitalist countries, such as Japan. It merely uses Marxism to deceive the Eastern proletariat and weak nations to create useful tools for the Third International to realize its ambition of controlling the entire world by holding the East hostage. If we observe the actions of the Third International in detail, we will be even more aware of Soviet Russia's soaring ambition in world politics. The so-called Third International is merely used by Soviet Russia to compete for supremacy and dominance in the world. Take the details of the Noulens case today as an example. The vicious instigation and destruction against China and the East are enough to prove that the Communist International is an obstacle to world peace.</p>
<p>The so-called Noulens is a foreign vagrant whose nationality is still unknown. He was sent to the East by the Third International and the Soviet Union. His major missions are: first, to direct the Red bandits who are ravaging China and plan military strategies for them; second, to guide the members of the Chinese Communist Party, accept their reports, and transmit the instructions of Soviet Russia and the Third International; third, to guide the members of the Communist Party in various parts of the Far East, create various plans for them, and instruct them in their work; and fourth, to carry out various attempts to subvert the Republic of China, destroy social organizations, and turn good people into Reds. With this concept in mind, readers can read the details of the Noulens case and the contents of its various criminal documents to understand the malice of the Communist International and Soviet Russia towards us, and that Noulens is the main culprit endangering the Republic of China. Please briefly describe the outline of the Noulens case below:</p>
<p>The success of the Noulens case this time was due to the notification from Singapore. According to this notification, mailbox No. 205 of the China Shanghai Post Office was discovered to be used by the Communist Party for correspondence. It was further discovered that Herssens, who rented this mailbox, lived at No. 235 Sichuan Road, Shanghai. On June 10, the police sent detectives to watch this mailbox. From this clue, it was discovered that Noulens often went to No. 49 Nanjing Road on the 16th, 17th, and 18th. On the 15th of the month, Noulens also went from there to No. 235 Sichuan Road and went straight into room No. 4. After confirming that he was the owner of the room, he started searching. A batch of correspondence and 27 keys were found there. Then, they went to room 30C at No. 49 Nanjing Road and found many more Communist Party books in Russian and other languages. At this time, Noulens admitted that he was Belgian. When he was taken to the Belgian consulate, he suddenly tried to tear up two passes, one was a monthly bus pass, and the other was a Beiping Park tour pass. However, the Belgian consulate did not recognize them. At 2:30 pm on the same day, a woman named Van Vandercrugssn also came to room 30 at No. 49 Nanjing Road and saw Noulens and the detectives there. In infinite fear, she admitted that she was Mrs. Motte, who lived at No. 74 WesAnd Gardens. However, when the two of them were taken into the room together, the servant admitted that he was hired by them. Then, from one of their passports, it was discovered that Herssens lived at No. 66 Hede Road. As a result of the inspection there, it was also discovered that Noulens also lived there, in room 30 at Nanjing Road, and three leather boxes were searched. One of them contained documents on the international communist movement and documents on the Pan-Pacific Workers' Movement, and it contained an overview of the Communist Party's activities. In addition, a passport photo from British Canada was found, which was Noulens himself, but it was changed to Donat BoutLangar. According to the information obtained from the general investigation, Noulens suddenly changed his nationality to Swiss and changed his name to Beuret, but no strong evidence was obtained, and it was not recognized by the Swiss consulate. Although it coincided with the number of eight mailboxes rented by the post office, there were more than 40,000 yuan stored in Chinese and foreign banks under various Chinese and foreign names. Its purpose is quite noteworthy. In addition, after several interrogations by the court, Noulens, in addition to defending his name, age, and nationality, answered everything else with the phrase "I refuse to answer." The reason why he did not answer at all was probably to comply with the so-called "iron discipline" of the Communist Party. The above is a brief description of the cracking of the Noulens case, from which we can know that Noulens bears a great responsibility to the Communist International, and also occupies an important position in the work of the activities in the East. As for the documents seized, after a thorough examination and review by the Public Works Bureau Court and us, we thought that Noulens' conspiracy was shocking to the extreme of the Third International's aggressive policy. Several of them were handwritten records in pen and pencil by Noulens himself, mostly to direct worker riots and train workers and peasants in the Soviet areas of China, and to send party members to the Philippines, Korea, India, Annam, Japan and other places to incite workers, as well as to plan the organization, propaganda and training of the Communist Party in Japan and other places. There are many documents that are reports and training in nature, including Noulens' reports to the Third International, reports from various countries and places to Noulens, and Noulens' instructions to various countries and places. The contents of the incidents are all about inciting and organizing workers and peasants, giving them communist training, in order to disrupt the politics of various countries and places. In addition, the contents of the documents on China are extremely vicious and ugly. Reading them is enough to reveal the ferocity of the Third International, through Noulens, against the Eastern nation. The responsibility that the Third International should bear to China, and the responsibility that Noulens should bear to China's internal strife, can be fairly judged by the nations of the world.

<h3 id="e68">The Dispute over Opening Dikes and Discharging Water in Jiangbei <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The People of Five Counties and the Salt Company Each Hold a Different View</p>
<p>▲The Disaster Relief Association of Zhenyang, Yancheng, Taizhou, and Dongtai sends a telegram to Sun Jun, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction: According to Shen Linsen, a refugee from Dongtai County, who reported to the association, Linsen witnessed the market in Xinqiaokou, Dongtai, being three or four feet deep in water when he came from Dongtai on August 29. When he passed Shinian, he saw that the shops in the city were all submerged in water. Then, he passed the dam at Jiangyan and saw a little dry land. Everywhere below the dam was three or four feet deep in water. He also heard that the water channels east and west of the Fan Dike in Dongtai penetrated the dike and lost its effectiveness. People in Dongtai all said that the disaster was caused by the Dafeng Yuhua and other companies resisting the provincial government's order to open the ports of Tonghai. Now, the Nanbei, Zhongmao, You, and Ziwu rivers are nominally open, but in reality, they are still blocked. For example, the downstream of the Xiaoyang River, which was newly dredged this year by Mr. Zhu Zhongjian of the Yizhen Society, was also blocked by the Xiangfeng District, so that hundreds of miles of the old channels returning to the sea were surrounded by the company's long dikes. This is the reason why this year's flood was stored up and difficult to discharge suddenly in the counties of Yancheng, Fengtai, and Dongtai. The company prioritizes protecting the cotton inside the dike and disregards the lives of several counties. It is the way of the rich not to be benevolent. The only strange thing is that the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau Chief, who was ordered to open the dikes, blocked them as soon as they were opened. It is unknown what role he played in this. It seems necessary to appeal to your association to request the authorities to consult with Zhang Suijing, the military governor, to personally supervise and immediately open the company's long dikes that are retaining water. Otherwise, not only will the massive amount of water in the lower counties be difficult to recede, but also the provinces of Lu, Yu, Anhui, and Jiangsu will be affected. This point is of utmost importance. As for the request for urgent relief, the most urgent is the lowest-lying stove east of Dongtai, and it goes without saying that the poor people in Dongtai city are unemployed and eagerly waiting for food. Please find a way to provide relief. The Yun Dike has multiple breaches, and the flood is pouring down. Your association cannot immediately block it, and the downstream exit to the sea is not effectively opened. Is it your intention to completely put the people of five counties to death? We are furious and are specially weeping and imploring your association to quickly open a line of grace and go to forcibly open the dikes day and night. It is necessary to completely demolish the dikes of the companies and reply to our association to reassure people. The Disaster Relief Association of Zhenyang, Yancheng, Taizhou, and Dongtai kowtows.</p>
<p>▲The Joint Association of Salt Reclamation sends a telegram to Military Governor Zhang in Yangzhou: Military Governor Zhang, may your lordship be blessed. Disaster has struck Jiangbei, and the Honghu Lake has shifted eastward. The deaths and injuries of the disaster victims are visible and audible. No one does not have the idea of destroying their homes to help the disaster. Seeing the newspaper reports that the people of Jiangdu are requesting your lordship to send troops to remove the dikes of the salt reclamation companies to discharge water, the association is in a situation where it will not fight for the survival of the companies. However, there are hundreds of thousands of tenant farmers on the reclaimed land. If the dikes are removed, their families will be completely destroyed. How can they not be taken into consideration? Recently, we received a telegram from the Xiaohai Tongsui Company stating that there have been casualties due to fighting between the people and the tenant farmers. The tenant farmers of Dafeng are even more numerous. The company has been running around and persuading them to open the Sanmao Youhe dam as ordered by the province to avoid the exchange of cannon and peacefully comply with the order to open. The details have been seen in the successive telegrams to the provincial government. The removal of the dikes concerns the survival of the tenant farmers and their families, and they will fight to the death. However, the people are eager to speak out to save the disaster, and the lives of both sides should be taken into consideration. A detailed examination should be carried out. The association has received many letters and telegrams from the companies for help, and it is responsible and conscientious and cannot but apply. We urge your lordship to consider the terrain of the companies, which is high in the east and low in the west, and how much the removal of the dikes will reduce the flow of water for the three districts at the cost of the lives of tens of thousands of tenant farmers, and then act after deliberation. Then, even if the tenant farmers die, they will have no complaints. Furthermore, it is now the autumn flood season, and the sea tide is pouring in, causing harm not only to the company, but also urging you to pay attention. With sincerity and devotion, we are overwhelmed with grief. The United Association of Salt Reclamation Companies in Huainan.</p>

<p>Jiaodong Also Suffers from Floods</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication. Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu held a fundraising conference in the city government auditorium at 4 pm today (3rd) due to the severe floods along the Yangtze River. More than 50 representatives from all walks of life attended the conference. Mayor Hu chaired the meeting and reported that the disaster caused by the floods in our country this time, the severity of the disaster, and the extent of the area are unprecedented in history. As for the fundraising level, there are already Hubei Flood Fundraising Association, Anhui Flood Fundraising Association, and Five Provinces Flood Fundraising Association in the city. However, some fundraising aspects are biased towards one part, and some relief aspects are biased towards one part, or they are organized due to township relations, or they are raised by the original charitable organizations. The so-called National Flood Relief Association is to make a kind of overall plan for all the affected areas and the areas to be relieved. This city is still lacking. Now Shanghai and Hankou have been established one after another. Qingdao is a major port in North China. How can it lag behind others? Yesterday, we received a telegram from the National Flood Relief Committee of the National Government, instructing us to unite all public and private organizations and enthusiastic people in the city, work together, and start working. How should this association be organized, how should fundraising methods be carried out, and we hope that you will discuss with each other so that we can see its success as soon as possible in order to save tens of millions of hungry disaster victims, and we will not live up to the meaning of holding this conference today. After the report was completed, the discussion on the implementation plan began. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The name is named Qingdao National Flood Relief Association.

<p>This year, the floods in the provinces along the river are a disaster, and the misery has not been seen in hundreds of years. Jiaodong is located in a remote corner of the sea and has never suffered from floods or droughts, and there are few disasters of soldiers and bandits. Merchants and people enjoy a lot of blessings. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of autumn this year, there have been not only bandits like hair, but also continuous rain, which often lasts for several days and nights. The low-lying areas have become a vast ocean. Autumn crops have been submerged by water. Fortunately, the wheat season is still good, and there is no starvation for the time being. However, the price of grain has doubled compared with before. As a result, the flour in Qingdao and Jinan has been greatly increased. It is reported that those who went to Jinan to report the flood disaster include Gaomi, Pingdu, Yexian, and other counties. (September 4)</p>

<p>Shenyang Communication. Chu Minyi, the leader of the Chinese side of the Sino-French Academic Inspection Group and a member of the Central Committee, arrived in Shenyang on the 1st of this month from Russia via Manchuria.

<h3 id="e72">Han Fuqu Departs from Jinan to Henan <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Negotiate the Clearing of the Countryside in Shandong and Henan</p>
<p>Passed Through Xuzhou to Bianjing on the Morning of the 5th</p>
<p>Jinan Communication. Han Fuqu, the chairman of the provincial government, returned to Jinan from Beiping on the evening of the 2nd. It was originally scheduled to hold the oath ceremony for the post of Director of the Clearing of the Countryside in Shandong and Henan at 8 am on the 3rd, and in the afternoon he would go to Kaifeng with Jiang Bocheng and Zhang Yue to meet with Liu Zhi, the chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, to plan the clearing of the countryside in the two provinces. Later, because the 4th was the day of the state funeral of the late President Tan, he was ordered to stop entertainment and celebrations, so it was decided to go to Henan first, and hold the oath ceremony after returning to Jinan. It was also decided to leave Jinan at 7 pm on the 4th. According to Jiang Bocheng, there are two tasks for this trip to Henan: (1) Plan the clearing of the countryside in the two provinces; (1) Chairman Han went to Beiping to discuss with Deputy Commander Zhang and the generals of North China the issues of Yan Xishan's departure abroad and the security of North China, and the result was satisfactory, but Chairman Liu did not arrive, and the bad lands of Shandong and Henan are adjacent to each other and have close relations, so Chairman Han needs to contact Chairman Liu. The round trip is expected to be one week. Now that North China is pacified, there are only a few hundred Liu Guitang's troops left in Liangshan, which can be solved. After I return to Jinan, I will definitely go to Nanjing to report everything to Commander-in-Chief Jiang, and then return to Jinan after the Fourth National Congress.</p>
<p>Han Fuqu's special car was prepared on the 4th and parked at the station. In the afternoon of the 5th, the main leaders of the party, army and government agencies all came to the station to see him off. There were military guards on the streets from the provincial government to the station. Soon, Han Fuqu, Jiang Bocheng, Zhang Yue, Ge Guangting, Peng Shibin and others arrived at the station one after another. According to Han, this trip was to meet with Chairman Liu, because Chairman Liu had telegraphed several times before he went to Beiping to invite him to Henan for a talk, so he went to fulfill the agreement today to negotiate the method of clearing the countryside in the two provinces. Then, they boarded the car together. At 5:40, the car also went south. It was decided that when passing through Tai'an, Ma Hongkui would also board the car to follow. After Han went to Henan, the military affairs of Jinan were handed over to Cao Fulin, the commander of the 29th Division (because Sun Tongxuan returned to Zhoucun for the original defense), and the political affairs were handed over to Li Shuchun, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, to act on his behalf. (4th)</p>
<p>Xuzhou Communication. Han Fuqu's special car met with Ma Hongkui when passing through Tai'an and gave some instructions on the suppression of bandits in southern Shandong. At 5:40 am on the 5th, it finally arrived in Xuzhou. The special car stopped at the station to load coal and water. The reporter interviewed Han in the train. Han said that he was invited by Chairman Liu to Bianjing to discuss clearing the countryside and suppressing bandits. He would return to Jinan in about a week. At present, the overall situation in North China is completely stable. Deputy Commander Zhang has sent a representative to Jin to persuade Yan to go abroad. Feng will not cause problems either. Now, our goal is to pay more attention to the Ganzhen incident, but the distance is far, and we can't get the details. The political situation in Shandong Province is being reorganized. Regarding the incident of the Japanese massacring Chinese in Qingdao, after he returned to Jinan, the Japanese consul came to visit and said that it was not as bad as reported in the newspaper. To get the real truth, there will be a thorough investigation and proper measures. The Japanese consul cannot cover people's eyes and ears with one hand. The remnant troops of Liu Guitang entrenched in Feicheng have been ordered by Ma Hongkui to send four regiments of troops to encircle and suppress them. The remnants of the bandits Guo Mafeng are also being attacked by Ma's troops in Mengshan, said Jiang Bocheng. After this time, the generals in Beiping paid homage to Zhang, and the situation in North China has been further guaranteed peace. Zhang sent a representative to Jin, and Han also sent a representative, Liu Xizhong, to accompany him to persuade Yan to leave the country as soon as possible. At present, the generals of the Jin side also hope that Yan will leave Jin. Whether Feng will go abroad is still in the second step. Ji Hongchang resigned this time, which can be regarded as being deeply aware of righteousness. There are no other problems. The remnants of Shi Yousan, who were reorganized by Han, were not enough for a division, and they were led by Zhan Shutang. They are now being transferred to Jiaodong for training, and Shandong Province has also entered a quiet area. Han's special car went west at 7 o'clock and could arrive in Bianjing that night.

<h3 id="e73">Anhui Province Will Add New County Governance <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Four Counties Agreed to Establish Jiashan County</p>
<p>Mingguang Communication. The three boundaries in eastern Anhui are located at the intersection of the four counties of Chu, Lai, Gan, and Ding. Bandits are rampant, and the area is like a wasteland. The representatives of the local people, Shao Shugu and Wu Jingye, previously submitted a petition to the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government of the Interior, proposing to change the administrative area and establish Jiashan County to facilitate governance. The Ministry consulted the government and the department to investigate and review. Now, the Civil Affairs Department has specially appointed Yang Hongbin to go to the four counties for detailed investigation, and convened a meeting of the county heads of the four counties in the three boundaries to discuss. It was decided that it is necessary to establish a county and divide the area for governance. A plan was drawn up to plan the five districts of Mingguang, Sanjie, Guandian, Shiba, and Zilaiqiao in Xiuyi, and the Nansanbao in the Gupeiqu District, the Lushan in the Jianxi District, the Ma Yuantang, Yingfusi, Xiaodaishan, Fanshan, Jiangninghou, and Zhang Baling districts of Chuxian, the Jiashanbao, Dabeibao, Dananbao, Panjiaying, Sanheji, and Huaixuyuan districts of Dingyuan, the Yinjiaji, Jiashanji, and Zhangpuying areas of Laian, and the old Southeast Third District of Fengyang as the territory of Jiashan County. However, due to geographical relations, Chihe, Daishan, Pancun, Ziyang, Bogang, Jiuxian, Sangji, Daijiaxiang, Jinli, and other places in the vicinity have automatically requested the Civil Affairs Department to be incorporated into the new county. It is not known how to handle it. (September 4)</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Advance of the Bandit Suppression Army in Western Anhui <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>After crossing the Yue River, they successively captured strategic locations.</p>
<p>The Central Government sent airplanes to bomb.</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Yue Shengxuan, the Commander of the Fourth Division of the Pacification of the Border Region of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and Commander of Bandit Suppression, and concurrently Commander of the 46th Division, has been directing various troops in Liu'an to cross the Pi River and suppress the Red Bandits since last month. Within a week, they have achieved consecutive victories and made rapid progress. Wang Fanqing, Brigade Commander of the 136th Brigade of the Yue Division, leading the Gao and Zhou Regiments, along with Yang Lianchi, Commander of the Liu'an Security Corps, and other units, advanced towards Xin'anji from the 27th to suppress the bandits. The Gao Regiment encountered over a thousand bandits in Meijiaji and Meijiachanggang, while the Yang Security Corps encountered over five hundred bandits in Zhajiadun and Yangliudian. Upon seeing the troops, the bandits immediately fled south. Brigade Commander Wang led his troops in pursuit. The bandits resisted stubbornly from the highlands of Gaogang Temple and Baigudun. Zhou Regiment launched a frontal feigned attack, while the Gao and Yang Regiments outflanked the bandits from both wings. After two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand and fled south in disarray. At that time, there was heavy rain, so they were not pursued relentlessly. In this battle, over two hundred bandits were killed, and over thirty were captured, all of whom were executed on the spot. Brigade Commander Wang and the Security Corps then continued to search and suppress southward along the river from Xin'anji, advancing to Xinglongji and Shatandian, successively capturing strategic locations. The 342nd Regiment's 1st Battalion and various Communist Eradication Corps stationed in Liu'an County also left the city one after another, crossing the river from Shangxia Longzhua to assist in the search and suppression. They seized four Red Bandit grain depots along the way and defeated Red Bandits from Tianjialao Geng, Shatandian, and Wu's Great Alley. As a result, the bandits along the river near the city were basically eliminated. Only in the Er Tianmen area were there still a few plainclothes bandits occasionally appearing. For the sake of consolidating the rear defenses, Brigade Commander Wang did not advance rapidly for several days but camped on the beach, resting and searching for lurking bandits. They were scheduled to continue advancing towards Xujiaji from the 1st of this month. It is heard that the Central Government will send a portion of airplanes to Liu'an for reconnaissance and bombing. Each bandit suppression unit has already prepared aircraft identification flags for use when the airplanes arrive. (September 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Wang Rongbao's Report on the Investigation of the Korean Incidents <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>The anti-Chinese riots by Koreans in Wonsan occurred on the night of July 4th. At the beginning of the incident, Vice Consul Yang telegraphed various Daotais (Circuit Intendants) and police departments of each county, requesting them to earnestly protect the lives and properties of overseas Chinese. He also notified the Chinese residents that in case of emergency, they could entrust their properties to the police and quickly flee to the Wonsan Consulate. By the 6th and 7th days, the situation became critical. Overseas Chinese inside and outside Wonsan City moved to the consulate for refuge, reaching a sudden total of one thousand people. As of the 14th, the number of people sheltered reached over two thousand three hundred. According to investigations, twenty-one Chinese residents were seriously injured due to the Korean riots. In addition, some were chased by thugs, blocked from crossing the river, and drowned. Corpses were recovered, one each in Wonsan Chuannei-ri. There are rumors of three deaths that can be confirmed and thirteen that have not yet been confirmed. Nineteen people are missing. This is the situation of the riots in Wonsan.</p>
<p>On the evening of July 7th at 10 p.m. in Sinuiju, Koreans rioted, gathering five to six hundred people to attack the Chinese residents of Genzacho. Fortunately, major shops had received prior notice and had already closed their doors, and only doors and windows were broken, and no goods were lost. The consulate had negotiated with the Do Governor and the police station in advance for prevention, and upon the outbreak of the riot, immediately telegraphed the police station to send a large number of police to suppress it, which quickly dispersed. All overseas Chinese went to the consulate, and all important business records of the chamber of commerce were also transported to the consulate. On the morning of the 8th, rumors worsened, and riots broke out. Many Chinese people on the road were injured. Consul Zhu, due to the urgency of the situation, rushed to the Do Office and police station to negotiate, borrowing cars to transport overseas Chinese outside the city to safety. At one point, more than one thousand two hundred people came to the consulate and chamber of commerce for refuge, and three thousand five hundred people went to Andong. Also, because the consulate and chamber of commerce buildings were small, the elderly, weak, women, and children were sent to Andong, totaling more than six hundred people. The Andong County government, the commercial port public security bureau, the general chamber of commerce, etc., designated two theaters and three cinemas to set up five shelters and properly arranged them. That night, the Sinuiju consulate and chamber of commerce were heavily guarded. Empty shops left by overseas Chinese were patrolled and guarded by the police, and there were no major losses of goods and property. An investigation the next day found fourteen people lightly injured. In addition, on the night of the 7th, rioters broke the doors, windows, glass, and wooden boards of four Chinese shops in Nakanoshima. However, the Dong Sheng Fu store suffered heavier losses, amounting to about one hundred yuan. Police officers heard the news and came out to suppress the rioters, who then turned to attack the worker dormitory of the Arakawa group outside the city, breaking in and beating worker Yu Fujing in the chest and ribs, causing his death. There were also five or six injured people. The murderers were arrested, along with others involved in the riots, totaling forty-six people detained. Also, one worker from the Sanchon Gold Mine Company in Uiju County was beaten to death by rioters. In other places, such as the Chinese residents in Seolsan, Bukchin, Daeyudong, Sonchon, Chongju, Namshi, Guseong, Yangshi, Gusan, Bakchon, Nyeongan, and Uiju, were also beaten and injured, and their shops were attacked, but the circumstances were not serious. The direct cause of this incident was that Japanese and Korean newspapers fabricated facts about the Wanbaoshan Incident and spread them widely, recklessly inciting ignorant masses in Korea. The Incheon incident, which occurred earliest, was due to an extra edition issued by the Gyeongseong Korean Daily News, which stated that in the Wanbaoshan Incident, as a result of a conflict between Chinese and Koreans, hundreds of Koreans were killed (initially saying more than two hundred, then mistakenly saying up to eight hundred), leading to public outrage and riots. As soon as our consuls in various parts of Korea received the news, they immediately requested local officials to send police to suppress the riots and requested additional armed police to be dispatched. However, during that period, the Governor-General and the Administrative Superintendent of Korea were in the process of changing over, and there was no one in charge of the Governor-General's office. Repeated requests were made, but they were unwilling to issue orders in a timely manner to mobilize arms or dispatch military police to stop the riots, resulting in inconsistent measures in various places, and the peaceful region became the scene of unprecedented massacres. No matter how the Japanese government tries to defend itself, it cannot escape its responsibility. The Korean Governor-General's office and general Japanese newspapers are still using the Wanbaoshan Incident as an excuse, claiming that Chinese oppression of Korean farmers led to this action, as if the responsibility for this Korean riot should be borne by Chinese officials, which is a distortion of the facts and is beyond reason. Therefore, in order to study where the responsibility for this incident lies, first and foremost, the truth of the Wanbaoshan Incident must be thoroughly investigated. I will now list the beginning and end of the Wanbaoshan Incident as investigated in Shenyang, summarized on the left.</p>
<p>1. The cause of the incident: Chinese man Hao Yongde organized the Daotian Company and rented five hundred qing of wasteland belonging to the Xiao and Zhang families in Sanxingbao for planting paddy fields. He hired Koreans to work for him, and a contract was signed and submitted to the Changchun County government for approval. The county government believed that the matter was feasible but required that the articles of association and boundary map be submitted for approval before it could be handled. It also ordered that no more than twenty Koreans should be hired. However, Hao Yongde believed that he had obtained official approval and sublet the land to nine Koreans, including Shen Lianze, and recruited more than one hundred and eighty Koreans, who immediately started digging and diverting water, destroying civilian farmland for more than twenty li, until the banks of the Yitong River. The people rose up to oppose them, preventing the Koreans from working. Japanese Consul Tashiro sent Japanese police to protect the Koreans and prevent them from stopping work. Our side also sent police to protect the Chinese. This is the origin of the negotiation.</p>
<p>2. The course of the negotiation: After the people of Wanbaoshan, Changchun, rose up to prevent the Korean expatriates from digging ditches and diverting water, the Koreans, backed by the power of the Japanese police, refused to stop work. At that time, Zhou Yuping, Director of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, initiated negotiations with Japanese Consul Tashiro. At that time, Lin, the Japanese Consul-General stationed in Liaoning, came to see Zhang, Chairman of Jilin Province, to report on this matter. Chairman Zhang had not yet received a report on this case from the Jilin Provincial Government, so he verbally agreed with Consul-General Lin that both sides would first withdraw their police before engaging in peaceful and reasoned negotiations. Lin had agreed, so Chairman Zhang ordered our side to withdraw the police, while Japan had not withdrawn and instead urged the Koreans to proceed with the ditch digging work even more urgently. Zhou Yuping conducted reasoned negotiations, arguing back and forth verbally and in writing, but to no avail.</p>
<p>3. The current situation on the Japanese side: The Koreans have now completed the ditch digging and water diversion, and water is already being introduced into the fields. Japanese police have occupied two civilian houses at the Majiashao entrance, erected thirty-nine military tents, hoisted the Japanese flag, and set up four machine guns. They have also dispatched three mounted police to patrol and search. Within four or five li of Majiashao, Chinese people are not allowed to walk. The current situation near Wanbaoshan is already like an area under Japanese occupation. 4. The current situation on the Chinese side: The Chinese people of Wanbaoshan once gathered to fill in the dug ditches, but Japanese police opened fire, fortunately without casualties. After our police persuaded them to stop and await negotiations, the Chinese people have all dispersed. At that time, Zhang, Chairman of Jilin, returned to Liaoning from Beiping, and Consul-General Lin also returned to Liaoning from Tokyo. After meeting, Lin was willing to study this case in detail before proceeding with negotiations. Chairman Zhang then telegraphed to summon Zhong Yu, a special commissioner for negotiations, to Liaoning, and Lin also telegraphed to summon Ishisha, the Japanese Consul in Jilin, to Liaoning, so that Zhong and Ishisha would be responsible for the negotiations. Now Zhong and Ishisha have both returned to Jilin and are scheduled to negotiate this case in Jilin or Harbin. However, Ishisha had previously attempted to mediate this matter on his own and had proposed four conditions: (1) compensation for the Koreans' losses, (2) payment of living expenses for the Koreans this year, (3) permission for the Koreans to live freely in Changchun, and (4) approval from the provincial government for the Koreans to grow rice next year. However, these four conditions have already been rejected by the provincial government. Consul-General Lin has also stated that the previously proposed conditions are all withdrawn.</p>
<p>According to the above, the so-called Wanbaoshan Incident is only the fact that Koreans, backed by Japanese power, oppressed the Chinese people, and there was absolutely no action by Chinese officials to oppress Korean farmers. All the propaganda in Japanese and Korean newspapers is deliberately fabricated and sensationalized. Not only do the Chinese unanimously say so, but Japanese officials also know that it is not true at all. For example, the Heihoku (Pyongan) Do Office's announcement to the Koreans stated that this kind of news is mostly unfounded. Therefore, to say that the Korean Incident and the Wanbaoshan Incident have a cause-and-effect relationship is clearly unreasonable. The key to this negotiation is that the Japanese side insists on handling everything in accordance with its domestic law, including investigations, preliminary trials, prevention of recurrence, and relief, all of which are initiated and completed by itself. Our side, on the other hand, insists on using international negotiations, including apologies, punishing the perpetrators, guaranteeing the future, and compensating for damages, all of which must be done with the consent of both parties. The point of contention here lies entirely in the issue of responsibility. Once the issue of responsibility is clarified, all of the above can be easily resolved. According to the current investigation, this responsibility lies entirely with the other side, and our side has absolutely no responsibility to speak of. There are international precedents for all negotiation methods, and the general principles are already well understood. I request that you proceed earnestly based on the established policy in order to achieve a certain victory. As for Rongbao, who has been entrusted with the mission of protecting overseas Chinese and promoting friendly relations between the two countries, such a major event has occurred within the territory of the country, resulting in the tragic death of many innocent overseas Chinese. I was unable to prevent the disaster in advance, and it has further alienated the relationship between the two countries in the future, which is contrary to my original aspirations and fills me with endless guilt. I should request that the National Government be informed and allowed to vacate my post in order to clarify my responsibility. I am extremely grateful for your understanding. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Rongbao, Ambassador to Japan. (End)</p>

<p>The telephone company is temporarily unable to increase prices. The Kunshan Telephone Company previously hastily increased prices, which was unanimously opposed by users who refused to pay their monthly fees. The company then submitted a request to the county executive committee to maintain the original price increase plan. After deliberation by the party-government meeting, it was resolved that: (1) a price increase would only be allowed if improvements are deemed effective within ninety-two months; (2) monthly fees would be suspended if there are incidents of negligence in business. The company has already been ordered to investigate and comply.</p>
<p>The county government executed three kidnappers. In the case of the kidnapping of Wu Chengzhai and Wu Yunzhou in Xiemaqiao and Heshangbang, the county government sent detectives to arrest three bandits, Zhou Er Mazi, Liu A'da, and Hu Xiaoheshang. After interrogation and confirmation, they were executed by firing squad. Subsequently, the Baoshan County government arrested three accomplices, Tang Shaolian, Liu Daoai, and Yan Zhiqing. The county magistrate of this county sent police to bring the three bandits back, interrogated them separately, and all confessed to adultery, looting, and extortion. The county sentenced them to death, and the provincial government approved the sentence. At 10:00 a.m. on the 5th, County Magistrate Pang took his seat in the criminal court, signed the warrants for the three criminals, verified their identities, and tied them up to be executed by firing squad at the Shaanqian execution ground.</p>

<p>Strictly prohibit Wuxi-Cheng auto abuse of passengers. Citizen Ji Hao stated that since the opening of the Wuxi-Cheng long-distance bus company, there have been several incidents of injuring and killing people. Recently, there has been abuse of passenger loading, and the car is bumpy and tilted when driving, which is extremely dangerous. If a major disaster occurs, the company will only be subject to criminal penalties, and that's the end of it. But who will compensate for the lives of the passengers? In order to protect the lives of passengers, I hereby petition the county government to review and approve, and promptly order the Bureau of Construction and the Bureau of Public Security to conduct a thorough inspection of the car's load capacity and construction components, stipulate passenger seats, and strictly prohibit abuse of passenger loading, so that the company will be alert. After Chen County Magistrate received the petition, he immediately instructed the Bureau of Construction to forward it to the company, instructing that passengers must be loaded according to the stipulated number of seats in the future, and abuse of loading is prohibited, subject to punishment.</p>
<p>The third district urgently reports robbery. Lu Shiyuan, a resident of Xu Laiqiao, Yangming Township, Third District, is currently a bookkeeper in the Ling family's lumber store outside the West Gate, and is considered well-off. At about 10 p.m. the other day, seven or eight robbers suddenly came to Lu's house, speaking in a strong northern accent, wearing dark blue short clothes, and holding weapons such as handguns, iron rulers, and flashlights. They used a large stone to break open the main gate and rushed in, immediately tying up Lu's women one by one and forcing them to reveal the location of the hidden money. Then they rummaged through chests and searched at will. After half an hour, they escaped with their stolen goods. Afterwards, an inspection of the losses revealed that clothing, decorations, cash, and other items worth more than 300 yuan were stolen.</p>
<p>Water police detective privately settled the case. Shao Genren, the owner of the pepper alley ferry boat near Shitangwan, Sixteenth District of the county, transported goods from Shanghai back to Wuxi the other day. When the boat docked outside the West Gate, someone secretly reported to Lu Hongtai, a detective of the Sixth Squad of the Second Water Police District, that Shao's boat had contraband hidden. Lu, based on the report, went to search with Deputy Detective You Hanwen and detective Zhou Afu, finding 25 pieces of red earth and four taels of Yuntu. They took the witness to their private residence and discussed terms, eventually settling privately for 900 yuan without bringing the team or handing over the case to the district for investigation. Now the news has leaked, and District Chief Shen is conducting a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>The chief of the public security bureau extorted money in the name of disaster relief. Ma Ji, the chief of the Liuqiao Public Security Bureau, was ordered to seal and hire boats to carry disaster victims, but he actually took this opportunity to extort money from boat owners, arousing public outrage. After investigation and confirmation by the county party department, the county government was sent a letter to dismiss him.</p>
<p>The fraud case in the busy canal was thoroughly investigated by the province. The fraud case in the busy canal in Tongyi County was thoroughly investigated by the Provincial Department of Finance after being reported by the County Government. Li Baosheng, Zhu Ziruo, Chen Zhongli, and Tao Tiesheng, who were involved in the case, were escorted to the province for military law investigation. In the raid case at the new market in the south of the city, seven bandits, including Song Chaowu, were captured and sent by the Public Security Bureau to the County Government on the 5th, where they were subjected to military law investigation under the jurisdiction of the Pacification.</p>
<p>Fundraising methods for accommodating disaster victims. Nantong is accommodating disaster victims from Taidongxing counties in Jiangbei, which requires a large amount of money. The Jiangbei Charity Association remitted 1,000 yuan on the 5th, local wealthy people raised 15,000 yuan, and the business community raised 15,000 yuan. The Disaster Relief Association raised 30,000 yuan, which is still insufficient. County Magistrate Zhang telegraphed the Jiangbei Charity Association on the 5th, saying that the county had successively sent five Xingdong ferries and sixty boats, two thousand four hundred bags of flour, twenty thousand pieces of dry food, and one thousand pieces of medicine, but funds for the wheel and salt disaster are lacking, and it is difficult to cope. Please provide assistance quickly, etc.</p>

<p>The opening of the Chengxi (Jiangyin-Wuxi) road is hindered. The opening of the northern section of the Chengxi Highway was originally scheduled for the 1st of this month for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. However, there are eighteen Jiang family tombs north of the Nanha Canal Bridge. Although they were relocated during road construction, the relocation fee of 180 yuan has not yet been received, and the Construction Bureau has already closed the relocation expenses and reported them to the Finance Department for verification. The descendants of the Jiang family, due to not having the money to receive, opened a wide ditch in the middle of the highway in front of the tombs, preventing cars from passing. Negotiations are still underway, so the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the opening of the entire road is still unscheduled.</p>
<p>Merchants and residents of Yangshe testified that the prisoner was involved in riots. Yang's Security Corps and the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau previously captured a bandit named Zhi Songtao and escorted him to the county for interrogation. The merchants and residents of the town, because Zhi committed riots in the town on February 6, 1928, leading the crowd to kill, set fire, and rob command, reported to the county for strict punishment. Yesterday (4th) afternoon, County Magistrate Peng summoned merchants and residents Yan Shenrun, Li Jinfan, Cai Wengui, Zhao Jinlong, Xing Aiqing, Song Guibao, Sun Jinchu, and Sun Boyuan to court to confront Zhi, proving that the shops and houses of the people were all burned under Zhi's command, and that the riots were true. Zhi claimed that he went to Shanghai in January 1928 and only admitted to participating in political work, and later served as a resident detective in Shanghai Security Office. After the interrogation, he was put in shackles and imprisoned, and the rest were ordered to return.</p>

<p>Negotiating cooperation methods between the ministry and the province for telephone lines. The Zhejiang Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Bureau had a dispute with the ministry-run long-distance telephone line due to the construction of a line to Shanghai. Negotiations lasted for half a year with no results. The Zhejiang line could not connect to Shanghai, and the line was virtually abandoned. This year, the Ministry of Transportation once sent personnel to Zhejiang to request its return. The province had to repay the construction cost of 100,000 yuan, which was still difficult to achieve. Now both sides feel that the losses are huge and intend to implement cooperation. Li Ximou, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau, has formulated a method in which the Shanghai side's operating income belongs to the ministry, and the Zhejiang side's income belongs to Zhejiang, so that each gets its benefits. Li went to Beijing yesterday to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>The God of Wealth escaped danger, and the kidnapper drowned. Zhang A'yang, a farmer in Nanhuicun, Baiguan, Lihai, had some savings. His son was just a young man and was helping his father farm at home. Unexpectedly, twelve kidnappers suddenly came the other evening and took Zhang's son away. The villagers heard the sound and rang gongs to warn the others, and each carried guns and weapons to defend themselves. Eight bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, had already fled through Yilu Road. The remaining four bandits still held the hostage and walked along the beach. At that time, the tide was high, so the four bandits, along with the hostage, were swept away by the waves. Fortunately, the villagers who were catching the bandits had also arrived and tried their best to rescue the hostage, thus preventing the loss of life. The four bandits all drowned, and their bodies have floated up. The Shangyu County Government has sent a coroner to examine the bodies.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Telegraph from France: Workers Unconditionally Return to Work Today <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Workers' Representatives Apologize</p>
<p>Xu A'mei Arrested Yesterday</p>
<p>Workers of the French Water and Electricity Company, on the 4th of this month, were connecting wires at Shenyuli, Huacheng Road, when they molested a woman and assaulted residents, leading to a conflict with the police, causing great disturbance. The French police, in order to maintain order, announced a temporary curfew for several days, and the trams were suspended for two days. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, the workers specially appointed representatives to apologize to the police and the company yesterday, and requested to return to work unconditionally today, which was understood by both organizations. Thus, the sensational disturbance came to an end. The detailed account of the events is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Resolution Process: After the conflict between the workers and the French police, the workers spontaneously went on strike. Mr. Meng Suolang, the manager of the tram company, was very dissatisfied. He believed that the strike had nothing to do with the company, but the company suffered great losses. Therefore, the manager intended to hire new workers to work. Representatives of the French Water and Electricity Workers' Union, Zhang Renjun, Lu Guanhong, Ding Yougen, Qiao Linggen, and others, went to Mr. Du's residence yesterday to plead for help in restoring the workers' jobs and promised to ensure that similar incidents would not happen again in the future. At that time, Mr. Du ordered the representatives to first report to the Party Headquarters and request mediation on their behalf. After the representatives arrived at the Party Headquarters, they were lectured. Then, a representative from the Party Headquarters, Xu Yefu, along with the workers, went to Mr. Du Hua's residence and together went to the French police chief and the manager of the French Tram Company. The workers' representatives brought two apology letters and expressed their apology in person, promising to ensure that all workers would not cause similar incidents in the future. The manager said that if the workers could work peacefully and diligently, they could go to the factory to work at 11:00 tonight (i.e., last night) as usual. If they do not abide by the factory rules, they will be dismissed immediately. Furthermore, the company cannot guarantee that various administrative agencies will not arrest people at the factory in the future. The two letters are transcribed below:</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Company: To Whom It May Concern: Due to this unfortunate misunderstanding and conflict with the police officers, it has led to a general strike of all workers. This is truly a temporary mistake of the workers. Our representatives, in order to settle the matter and avoid the expansion of the situation, respectfully request that the Chief of Police of the Police Department allow the announcement to all workers to resume work together on Monday, and unconditionally, in addition to another apology letter to the Police Department. We specially send this letter, hoping for your understanding. Sincerely, To Mr. Manager of the French Tram Company, from representatives Zheng Deshun, Sun Heshang, Qiao Linggen, Ding Yougen, Zhang Yinsheng, Zhang Degui, Chen A'di, Zhang Sanlang, Lu Guanhong, Zhang Renjun.</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Police Department: To Whom It May Concern: Due to this unfortunate misunderstanding, an incident occurred involving a dispute with your police officers. This was caused by a misjudgment of the workers. Our representatives, in order to settle the matter and avoid the expansion of the situation, will be responsible for notifying all workers to resume work together on Monday. We will ensure that similar disputes will not occur in the future. We specially send this letter and express our apology. Sincerely, To Mr. Chief of Police Fervolle of your Police Department, from representatives Zheng Deshun, Sun Heshang, Qiao Linggen, Ding Yougen, Zhang Yinsheng, Zhang Degui, Chen A'di, Zhang Sanlang, Lu Guanhong, Zhang Renjun.</p>
<p>▲Arrest of Xu A'mei: After this disturbance occurred, the police conducted a thorough investigation and learned that Xu A'mei, an important member of the Water and Electricity Workers' Union, was present and directed everything at the time of the disturbance at the police station entrance, which was considered instigating behavior. They then reported to the Second Special Court, which issued an arrest warrant. At 3:00 PM yesterday, it was discovered that Xu was hiding in the rooftop garden of the New World Company. The head of the police immediately dispatched a reserve team and many detectives, who took police cars and first went to the Old Zha Gate Police Station to assist in the arrest. Unexpectedly, when the detectives arrived at the elevator gate, Xu was coming down the elevator, so they arrested him and took him directly to the Lujiawan General Police Station for temporary detention. At 5:00 PM, the head of the police dispatched the original detectives to Xu's residence at No. 495 Kangti Road to search the premises. They seized two large bags of various publications on the spot and transported them to the police station to await interrogation in court.</p>
<p>▲Receipts Seized: At 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, Peng Bowei, Inspector of the Detective Team of the Garrison Headquarters, Detectives Yang Fengqi, Xu Pengfei, and others, together with the Chief of the Second District General Office, went to the French Water and Electricity Workers' Union at No. 13 Dada Li, Luban Road, for a second search. As a result, they seized receipts from Xu A'mei for collecting three yuan per person from all workers, stating that the money was received on the 10th of this month. The Headquarters will strictly investigate the purpose of this receipt to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>▲Another Request for Severe Punishment: The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, regarding the case of Li Genfa, a fellow villager who was innocently beaten and injured by workers of the French Water and Electricity Company, convened a meeting of the executive committee to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to send a letter to the Second Court and the French Police Department, requesting them to severely punish the perpetrators according to law. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Association believes that the Water and Electricity Company workers insulted women and beat good people, which aroused great public indignation. If the court and the police department treat this as a common injury case and leniently sentence the perpetrators, it is feared that this trend will be infinitely harmful. Therefore, they have again sent letters to the two organizations, requesting them to arrest the masterminds and severely punish them. It is hoped that the authorities of the concession will take appropriate measures to resolve the matter satisfactorily.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Yesterday's News on Disaster Relief in Various Provinces <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangbei Refugees Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>The China Red Swastika Society recruited more than 400 refugees in the Jiangbei area. Yesterday, they took the slow train from Zhenjiang at 1:00 PM and arrived at the North Station at 9:30 PM that night. They were transferred to Nanshi, Zhabei, and other places for resettlement.</p>
<p>▲News from the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters: The National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters has been very busy recently. Although yesterday was Sunday, the work of various groups continued as usual. The news from yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Telegram from Tianjin: Zhu Ziqiao received a telegram from the Tianjin Flood Disaster Relief Association yesterday, stating, "Respectfully to General Zhu Ziqiao: This time, the Yangtze River Basin has been hit by floods. Our government has joined with all sectors of the Party, government, gentry, and business community in the city to organize the Tianjin Flood Disaster Relief Committee on the 27th of last month. Mayor Zhang was elected as the chairman. It was decided at the meeting to advance 60,000 yuan to Zhenyang and remit it to the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters in winter for verification and receipt. Urgent relief will be provided first. This telegram is respectfully reported. Tianjin Flood Disaster Relief Committee."</p>
<p>▲Telegram from Hankou: Zhu Qinglan, a member of the National Government Flood Disaster Committee, received an urgent telegram from Li Jin, the Hankou Relief Branch, yesterday, stating, "General Zhu: Received Jia Nong's telegram. Qian Kang, Cui Yang, Cha, and others have arrived. Now, after discussing with Zigon and Shaopeng, we have decided to form two teams to provide relief in the hardest-hit areas. Zigon will lead the first team to Xindi, and Shaopeng will lead the second team to Fankou. They will depart immediately. Relief supplies will be prepared and distributed by Jin. However, the disaster situation is extremely severe, and there are many victims. Please urgently raise and urge the delivery of relief supplies and funds for relief. Most urgent and hoped for. Li Jin."</p>
<p>▲Cheng Jingsheng's Work Report on the Disaster Area in Jiangbei: Cheng Jingsheng's report stated, "Jingsheng arrived in Zhen by night train on the 28th of last month. When passing through Su, Mr. Cao Songqiao, Yuan Xiaogu, and Hu Zuoquan, along with more than ten relief workers, boarded the train. They had already received Jingsheng's telegram. They immediately discussed relief measures on the train and did not sleep all night. At dawn, they arrived in Zhen, and Director Hu provided a car to meet them. They followed him to the provincial government to meet with Chairman Ye and Director Hu. They were filled with emotion after the reunion. Then, they met with Lu Xiaobo, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, who immediately requested that Ye and Hu hold an emergency meeting at the Chamber of Commerce. They immediately requisitioned four steamers, with sailboats attached, and carried dry food, large cakes, medicines, and the like. Secretary Li Rongzhuang and Gu Zifang were asked to escort one steamer each to Xinghua, and Jin Xingya and Yang Wanzhong were asked to escort one steamer each to Gao Shao Bao, to rescue people in different ways. Relief measures were also determined: (1) When disaster victims board the ship, their names and origins must be registered and disclosed at any time. (2) Each tugboat needs to be escorted by a relief worker, and the security team will assign soldiers to maintain order. (3) Rescued disaster victims will be sent to various resettlement areas. (4) Disaster victims who do not want to board the ship should be accommodated in thatched huts on the spot, and their food will be delivered daily by nearby shelters. (5) For remote areas where ships cannot reach, small boats should be hired to rescue and transport them to steamers. At that time, due to the shortage of relief workers, Chairman Ye was asked to assign four more people to participate in different ways: Yang Jun Dehuai, Shi Jun Zhi, Guo Jun Fuzeng, and Xu Jun Jiatang. The first to provide relief in Zhen were the Provincial Government and the Civil Affairs Department, which had dispatched commissioners with cash in advance, several thousand yuan per county, and set off by steamer. The Red Swastika Society also provided continuous relief. In addition, Yu Lengqiu and Lu Xiaobo organized the Jiangbei Temporary Righteous Relief Association, which took care of their urgent needs. This was particularly commendable. Jingsheng originally planned to depart for the disaster area with Chairman Ye the next morning, but Zhu Ziqiao's telegram arrived that day, so he did not go. Letters and telegrams were exchanged all night, and he did not sleep. The Zhenjiang resettlement centers were set up in three locations. On the 30th, four more steamers were requisitioned and dispatched to Xinghua and Dongtai. On the same day, the Jiangsu Righteous Relief Association's office in the province was established and jointly operated with the Jiangbei Temporary Righteous Association. On the same day, the Yangzhou office was also established. Cao Songqiao and Xiaogu had already gone to organize it the day before. About 500 refugees and hundreds of prisoners from Gaoyou crossed the river. President Wang of Jiangdu came to Zhen to meet with us and described the tragic situation in detail. I could not help but feel sad and cancelled dinner. Wang Yilao came to Zhen for a meeting, and the relief committee and the provincial government determined the allocation of relief funds. On the morning of the 31st, Chairman Ye and I took a steamer north and arrived in Yang at noon. We met with Songqiao and Xiaogu and learned that there were already three resettlement centers, housing more than a thousand people, providing daily meals, and the order was very good. No less than six or seven thousand people were transported to Zhen every day to seek a living on their own, which is still difficult to count. In the afternoon, we arrived at Shaobo. The water had completely receded, and the canal water had dropped by more than ten feet. Along the embankment, broken houses and dilapidated walls were everywhere. The houses on the east side of the embankment, under the embankment, were completely submerged in the water. The former densely populated settlements were completely washed away. According to the locals, the water was so fierce at that time that more than 20,000 people were washed away without a trace. The breaches along the way were more than a hundred feet wide. Mr. Wu Xiafeng said that it was really not easy to block. Chairman Ye decided to ask Brother Wang Shuxiang to discuss practical measures and ask for advice with an open mind, which is commendable for the people of Jiangbei. In the fifth village of Lujin, there were more than 3,000 refugees camping in the dense forest. The water was turbulent, and the boat could not go up, so there was no way to provide relief. I asked Chen Chuan of Jiangdu to return to Yangzhou and convey the message to Songqiao and Xiaogu to immediately requisition civilian boats and go around the lake to rescue them. The water in Gaoyou City was four or five feet deep, and all the power lines were destroyed. The prosperous streets and alleys of Sanfangli outside the North Gate were completely washed away, leaving a vast expanse of water. Floating corpses were seen far away in the treetops, undulating above the turbulent waves in the moat. Thousands of bodies were floating, and there was nowhere to bury them. The stench was nauseating. The water in the city receded six or seven feet, but in the deeper areas, it was still waist-deep. Rescue boats frequently went to and fro. The south of the city was safe and was where the disaster victims gathered. Just then, Director Li Mingyang was in You and invited Brother Shuxiang to see the breach and met with Chairman Ye. They went ashore to inspect the premises one by one. The Yunlou breach was the most dangerous. The sound of the water was surging, which was shocking. One can imagine the tragedy of the washout at that time. Everyone was in tears, and Chairman Ye was also sad and did not leave the town. That night, we stayed at the South Gate and met with Supervisor Zhang Zhijiang and Army Commander Liang Guanying. Because the water in Baoxing, Taidong, and four other counties had already forced the city to go public, and order urgently needed to be maintained, it was commendable to promise to divide the army to suppress the situation. The Huai River was not in danger, thanks to the defensive efforts of Army Commander Liang, and the various halls upstream blessed him, truly a living Buddha of all families. Shuxiang in the boat proposed temporary risk prevention to avoid expansion, and the measures are listed below. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Ye, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, is now planning to hire Shen Zhuowu, a specialist from the Ministry of Railways, to assist in the urgent relief of the Jiangbei flood disaster. In addition to coming to Shanghai the day before yesterday to invite Zhuo Jing, Huang Keda, and American engineer Bigger, who are engineers from the American-owned Asia Construction Company of the Republic of China, to undertake the Gongjia Dike breach closure project on the Yellow River, Shen also took the night train to Zhen last night to change trains and go to the various breach sites of the Grand Canal for surveying, so that the breach closure work could be implemented as soon as possible, so that the seven counties downstream that have been flooded can plant wheat as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e88">On-the-Spot Investigation of the Disaster Situation in Xinghua <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Xinghua Native Place Association received a letter from Zhenjiang yesterday from Mr. Liu Mingxiao, reporting on his investigation of the disaster situation after returning to Xinghua. The letter stated that Mingxiao set off on the 29th of August with the two ships hired by the provincial government, Xin Jiangshun and Xin Jiangsu, and arrived in Yangzhou in the evening. Due to the breach of the dike, the water level of the Grand Canal had receded. On the 30th, he set off from Yangzhou and entered the lower river boundary after passing through Dahanzi and Zhenwumiao. The water was turbulent and surging, forming a vast expanse of water. Only the rooftops and treetops of houses were visible along the way. The boatmen and soldiers repeatedly expressed their concerns about the extreme danger, saying that it would be extremely dangerous. On the 31st, they arrived in Xinghua and saw that only half of the higher buildings outside the city were still above the water surface. Transportation in and out of the city relied entirely on small boats. The county government hall, the junior high school, Kaiyuan Temple, and the Old Man's Mansion were not submerged, but the water level in the county government's screen wall and Gong Shengming and other places was already several inches deep. The water level in Sipailou and Dongsi Bridge was knee-deep, and the water level in Ruxue Street and West Street was chest-deep. The water level in the lower areas of the city and outside the city was shoulder-high or even covered the head. Fortunately, the market was as usual, and the order was still not chaotic. Shops and residents were living on wooden boards raised high, and although life was hard, there was no major danger. All sectors of Xinghua have now organized a temporary disaster relief association, which is located in the junior high school. The fellow villagers from Yanfu, Xintai, and the five counties of the east who traveled to Zhen organized the flood disaster relief association, which is located in the agricultural and mineral products display hall on Renzhang Road.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Urgent Telegram from County Magistrate Zhang of Taixian <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Fan Zhengbo received an urgent telegram from County Magistrate Zhang Yi of Taixian yesterday, stating, "To Mr. Zhengbo, please forward to Xu Junlao, Wang Yilao, Huang Renlao, Huang Ronglao, Du Yueyong, Gu Zhuweng, and Wang Binweng: The You Shao Dike collapsed, and the western water flowed down, causing the upper and lower rivers of Taixian to rise together, submerging two-thirds of the entire territory. There are more than 400,000 disaster victims, who have no clothes, food, or shelter. The situation is extremely dire. Yi waded through the water and risked his life to personally supervise the police team to rescue people. He has rescued more than 20,000 disaster victims to the city in recent days, but the rest are still trapped in desperate situations. Please appeal to all parties on our behalf to quickly transport a large amount of relief food, winter clothing, and cash to Taixian to rescue the disaster. We also hope that you will send it to various newspapers and publish it in large print to spread the word. The merit will be immeasurable. Zhang Yi." Fan was shocked by the telegram and sent letters to major philanthropists, requesting them to quickly provide assistance to save the people in the disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Report from Representatives of Hubei on the Real Situation in the Disaster Area <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Hubei Flood Disaster Relief Association's Shanghai Relief Office held a banquet at Gongdelin yesterday (the 6th) at 12:00 noon to entertain Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Jingren, and representatives of the Hubei Flood Disaster Relief Association in Shanghai, Party Committee Member Wen Juntian, Provincial Committee Member Zhu Huaibing, and High Society Representative Zhou Xingtang, and more than 30 people attended. Since the Chairman of the Office, Mr. Jiang Yuyan, had gone to Beijing and had not returned, Committee Member Liu Wanqing represented him in making inquiries. First, Mr. Zhu Ziqiao gave a speech, stating that the relief work was being presided over by Xu Jinglao in Shanghai. I had once gone to Han to observe, but I was not fully aware of the situation in various places. I hope that you can give detailed teachings on the real situation in Hubei and the process of handling relief matters, so that I can learn from them. Next, Mr. Zhu Huaibing, a member of the Hubei Provincial Government, reported on the disaster situation in Hubei. First, he described the flooding situation, stating that on July 24, the Yangtze River flooded, and the Xiang River also surged at the same time. Although attention had been paid to prevention, the disaster was unexpectedly so severe. In the past, flood prevention had been focused on the Zhanggong Dike, but this time the flooding first occurred in Danshui Pool. Within a few days, the entire city of Hankou was submerged. In Wuchang, the Xujia area had the most rapid water flow. After the Kuaizi Dike was breached, two-thirds of the city was flooded. In total, there were about 600,000 disaster victims in Wuhan. There were 45 counties in other provinces affected by the disaster, with 29 counties completely submerged, 9 counties with two-thirds submerged, and 7 counties with one-third submerged. The survey showed that there were 12 million disaster victims. Next, he talked about the relief efforts in various counties, stating that the disaster area was vast and relief was quite difficult. For emergency relief, the Emergency Relief Association first issued 5,000 yuan to each county and entrusted the county magistrates to distribute it. At the same time, they planned for follow-up work. This small amount of 5,000 yuan was really a drop in the bucket and was not enough to be called relief. However, the total amount of emergency relief from other provinces was more than 200,000 yuan. This is the real situation of the difficulty of relief. In Wuhan, fortunately, various charitable organizations and wealthy merchants have spontaneously donated money to assist the provincial government and work together. The disaster victims are not worried about starvation and are better off than the disaster victims in other counties. Next, he talked about housing. The Emergency Relief Association had the most difficulty in accommodating disaster victims. Although several shelters were set up at the time, they were soon submerged by the water. Rescuing them by boat involved countless difficulties. Whether it was using righteous ferries, restricting boat owners, or allowing them to freely demand money, it was not easy to be satisfactory. The reason was that there were so many disaster victims, who were competing for first place, and the Emergency Relief Association had limited manpower and could not be comprehensive. This cannot but be a regret. Now, several large shelters have been set up in Hanyang and Hongshan Phoenix Mountain, each of which can accommodate tens of thousands of people. However, there is a shortage of reed mats, which are not easy to purchase. They have recently been rushed from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Henan, which can probably be made up. Next, he talked about hygiene. In this vast flood, there was really no way to talk about hygiene. First, the drinking water was unclean. The tap water was blocked by the flood and had been cut off long ago. There was no way to do it, so they had to draw water on the spot. However, the water drawn on the spot was mixed with floating corpses, urine, and feces, and was indescribably filthy. Drinking it would easily cause diseases. Moreover, there were many mosquitoes during the flood, which also easily spread diseases. Recently, epidemics have occurred in Wuchang. Fortunately, Director Liu Ruiheng, who was sent by the central government, has established an anti-epidemic hospital, and the Emergency Relief Association has instructed all public and private hospitals to provide diagnosis and medicine free of charge, which may not be universal, but may prevent the spread. The above four points are the suffering of the disaster victims that Huaibing personally experienced in Hubei. The suffering of the disaster victims is already unbearably tragic. In addition, there are ordinary poor residents who are trapped in dangerous buildings, cut off from food and drink, with no way to call for help and no way to escape. The Emergency Relief Association has specially prepared rice, salt, oil, salted vegetables, etc., and used boats to sell or distribute them at affordable prices door to door, but it is also not easy to be universal. The disaster situation in Hubei this time is truly an unprecedented catastrophe. It is not easy to save the present, let alone the aftermath. In the blink of an eye, autumn is deep, and the cold wind is piercing the bones. Cotton clothing is a major problem for the disaster victims. Huaibing and others reported to the central government this time that they planned to use work relief and agricultural relief to seek the aftermath. Work relief will use disaster victims to repair dikes and dredge rivers, and agricultural relief will set up farmer loan offices in various counties by the Emergency Relief Association to protect arable cattle in order to restore planting. Today, the gentlemen present have repeatedly worked hard for the disaster victims in Hubei. Huaibing especially thanks on behalf of all the disaster victims in Hubei and hopes that all sectors will increase assistance. At three o'clock, they said goodbye and dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Meierhe's Report After Investigating the Yangtze River <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Meierhe, the Inspector General of Customs, recently went to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to investigate the disaster situation. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his work and submitted a detailed report on the investigation results to Song, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters. In addition to the disaster situation in various places, this report also mentions various relief issues and is very detailed. The Relief Committee will publish the most important parts of Meierhe's report as follows. According to Meierhe's report, according to past experience, if there are no special changes in the weather, the floods in Hanbu can recede to the Qi shore (45 feet 5 inches) in early October. The plains west of Hankou can recede completely within two months after mid-November. It is absolutely not true that the flood in Hanbu was caused by the breach of the Zhanggong Dike. The Zhanggong Dike was not breached. What was breached and infiltrated by water was the railway dike and the riverside road. The railway dike was very solid, but the water rose too high, exceeding the highest level in previous years by more than three feet, making it unable to support it. (According to the record, the dike was six inches higher than the highest water level in 1870, and it has been sufficient to prevent floods for more than sixty years.) Meierhe also said that if there is a lot of rain in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the river water is full early, forming a natural water gate, and at the same time, mountain floods in the upper reaches are torrential and cannot be discharged, then floods are inevitable. Fortunately, the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River flooded at the same time, which is only seen once in a hundred years. Otherwise, frequent floods would be even more unbearable. As for relief measures, Meierhe believes that dredging will definitely not work, because there is too much floating mud in the river, which cannot be removed by manual dredging. Planting trees can treat the root cause and is a long-term plan, not a symptomatic treatment. Too many dikes are also not appropriate, because the flat ground next to the dikes is too low, and sometimes it needs to be raised by alluvial mud. If only dikes are used to prevent floods, they are sufficient to prevent floods when the water is low. However, if the water continues to rise and increase, even if there is a breach, the damage will be far greater than this year. Meierhe also said that alluvial mud can make the soil fertile, and occasional overflows should be allowed to occur naturally. Finally, Meierhe also said that flood prevention should be the responsibility of a dedicated agency.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Anhui Relief Association <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anhui Flood Disaster Relief Association held its fifth standing committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Xu Jingren. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Recommend Li Zhenya, Cao Zhigong, and Zhu Runbin to contact the Social Affairs Bureau to resettle the disaster victims from Anhui who come to Shanghai, and send two people to the wharf and station to receive them. (2) Calligraphy and painting assistance relief, recommend Wang Yingbin as the preparation director. (3) Entertainment assistance relief, the location is held in the Great World. (4) In addition to publishing advertisements for assistance relief, publish advertisements for donations of sundries. (5) Send a letter to each fundraiser to report the amount of funds obtained to the association. (6) Telegraph to urge Yan Zhuang, the special commissioner for relief in Anhui and Jiangxi, to quickly release emergency relief. The original telegram stated that the disaster situation in Anhui Province is deep and long-lasting, and the distribution of emergency relief is valuable in its speed. The National Government has allocated 170,000 yuan specifically for emergency relief. If you conduct a deliberate investigation and distribution, it will be too slow to help those in need. Which one is not a fish? Please quickly release funds according to the disaster situation in each county to help the remaining people. Pay attention to the heavy disaster in Tongling and the collapse of the riverbank.</p>

<p>Over 17,000 Yuan from Mr. Yuan's Birthday Celebrations Donated to Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng's father, Mr. Xieyuan, celebrated his 90th birthday. Donations were collected during the celebrations and performances held by the Yage Society for three days, as previously reported. It is now reported that the Ningbo Native Place Association, which collected the birthday donations, received over 17,000 yuan yesterday. Mr. Yuan Ludeng and his brothers also plan to donate several thousand yuan of feast funds to the disaster relief effort. Mayor Zhang, recognizing Mr. Yuan's extensive network and contacts in other cities, has entrusted the Ningbo Native Place Association to continue collecting donations, compiling them, and allocating them to disaster areas.</p>
<p>▲ The Silk Industry Donates Over 2,000 Yuan. Silk industry figures such as Wu Zhihao, Chen Jing'an, and Liu Wenjie initiated a business relief effort from August 29th to September 4th, totaling seven days. The total revenue was 24,900 yuan. Ten percent, or 2,490 yuan, was donated. The funds have already been handed over to the Water Disaster Relief Associations of various provinces.</p>
<p>▲ The San Shan Guild Hall convened a meeting on September 1st and decided to donate 600 yuan from the savings of the Shendan opera expenses in September this year as a donation. In addition, five committee members were appointed to solicit donations from fellow members. It is reported that a significant amount has been collected and will be combined with the previous donation and sent to the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee for distribution.</p>
<p>▲ The Zhejiang Relief Association for Disaster Relief Transferred Surplus Materials to Aid Relief Efforts in Shanghai.

<p>▲ Suggestions on Making Biscuits to Relieve Disaster Victims. Li Jina, a secretary at the Anhui Provincial Government Secretariat, sent a letter to Zhu Ziqiao, offering suggestions on making biscuits to relieve disaster victims, stating: "When I passed Datong, I saw 200 large cakes on a lighter, shipped from Shanghai to Anhui to relieve disaster victims. They were moldy, worm-eaten, and smelled foul. I believe the biscuits were not properly baked by the biscuit workshops, and the hot weather caused them to steam and mold. The baskets they were packed in were also not sturdy, and they leaked and scattered along the way. Disaster victims who eat them will get sick. I suggest making coarse biscuits, or the best option would be to stir-fry wheat flour or rice flour until slightly yellow, add an appropriate amount of salt, and pack them in small bags made of sturdy, black paper commonly used by stores, each bag weighing one jin or two jin. Pack them in sturdy bamboo baskets and transport them to disaster areas for distribution. They do not require cooking and can be eaten with hot or cold water. They also have a salty taste, are durable, and easy to distribute. However, the amount of salt added must be carefully considered; too little will make them tasteless, and too much will make them too salty to eat. If it is difficult to get it just right, it is better to add less. The wheat flour and rice flour must be stir-fried, or they cannot be eaten with cold water. When making biscuits, someone must supervise to ensure that unsuitable items are not collected or transported. For large batches of food to be distributed for consumption, there will be malpractices if the workshop workers are perfunctory and sloppy. Supervisors must repeatedly urge and supervise, and items that do not meet the specified conditions should not only be returned but also subject to appropriate punishment to warn others." Zhu Ziqiao found Mr. Li's suggestions to be pertinent and has sent a letter to the Relief Association to consider them.</p>

<p>New Notice from the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government issued a notice yesterday, stating: "In order to issue a notice, the floods this year have been widespread, and the disaster situation is extremely severe. Soliciting donations and saving disaster victims is an urgent task. However, it has been reported that there have been cases of using disaster relief as a pretext to fraudulently obtain donations, which is extremely hateful. According to investigations, the supervision of temporary relief matters and charitable organizations in this city should be under the supervision of the Social Affairs Bureau. Any fundraising activities that have not been reported and registered should be banned to prevent abuses and uphold good deeds. In addition to ordering the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus to conduct strict investigations, all relief associations established in this city must first report for approval and registration to show seriousness. Those who raise funds without approval will be strictly prohibited. This order is of utmost importance."</p>

<p>The Naval Special Party Department sent a telegram yesterday to comfort Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the soldiers fighting the Reds. The original telegram is as follows: "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Nanchang and all the soldiers fighting the bandits at the front: The Red bandits are rampant, poisoning several provinces. The cruelty of their burning and killing is worse than that of [Zhang] Xianzhong. They also harbor the background of the Third International's intention to communize the world and are carrying out the conspiracy of a long snake and a giant pig. Although the loyal comrades of the Party have risen up to resist and reject their vicious plan to destroy the Party and the foundation of the country, they have not achieved their ambitions in the past. They still harbor ambitions and do not repent. They have taken advantage of the rebellions of warlords in recent years and taken the opportunity to disturb and rampage, becoming rampant today. Therefore, suppressing the Red bandits is a crucial plan to consolidate the foundation of the Party and the country and is the common expectation of the people of the country. Our Commander-in-Chief and the soldiers at the front have braved the heat and embarked on a distant expedition to eliminate the ferocity of the enemy. Your great achievements and feats are admired by all. The remnants of the Red bandits have become souls in a cauldron and will be annihilated soon. In order to implement the entire plan, our Commander-in-Chief has not shied away from fatigue and sits at the front, demonstrating a spirit of thorough struggle, which is admired by all comrades of the Party.

<p>Currently, There Are Over 40 Factories</p>
<p>The local silk industry previously suffered a sharp decline in European and American silk sales, resulting in a complete loss of capital. Factories reduced working hours and suspended machinery. After the issuance of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds, most local manufacturers, except for those who left Shanghai, have gone to the Custody Committee to collect their bonds, reaching 70-80%. However, when applying for public bonds, all manufacturers must pledge to resume operations immediately and maintain the work of female workers. Therefore, after receiving the bonds, factories are preparing to resume operations. In recent days, more than ten factories have reopened. According to the investigation, there are currently over 40 silk factories operating in Shanghai, including both old and new ones. The remaining factories are still overhauling their machinery and replenishing raw materials in preparation for resuming operations.</p>

<p>The election of village and township heads in the county has been ordered by the county government to be completed by the district chiefs. The township committees have been organized and officially established. Now, the county government believes that the election of village and neighborhood heads should continue immediately to complete self-governance. Therefore, County Chief Yan issued instructions to the district chiefs yesterday to supervise and urge the township chiefs to organize the election of villages and neighborhoods in order and report the progress for review.</p>
<h3 id="e106">City Chamber of Commerce Urges Filing of Business Tax Returns <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Collection by the Wusong, Pudong, and Jiangwan Offices</p>
<p>Since the City Chamber of Commerce resolved to assist in collecting and paying the business tax on behalf of the government, and established a special committee and office, all investigation and reporting procedures have begun. The two letters from the Chamber of Commerce are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Urging the Filing of Business Returns. The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various trade associations yesterday, stating: "Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's letter stating that the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau entrusted your association to assist in collecting and paying the business tax on behalf of the government, and sent business tax return forms to be distributed to various businesses to fill out and submit to the office by August 31st, it is now September, and the aforementioned return forms have not been submitted to the office. We hereby request your association to verify and expedite the submission of filled forms to the office. For businesses, members of this association, a copy of the form is enclosed with each letter sent by this association. For other trade associations, the number of members, both members and non-members, varies. It is impossible to guess how many forms are needed. Therefore, we sent a letter to each association to collect the forms from this association's distribution office. Until recently, many people came to collect the forms, but very few filled them out and submitted them to the association. The deadline has now passed, and the Business Tax Collection Office has urged us to report quickly, making it impossible to delay any further. Therefore, we send this letter to urge all those who have not yet come to collect the return forms to verify the number of forms needed and quickly collect them from this association's distribution office. Those who have collected the forms but have not yet filled them out and submitted them to the association should fill them out according to the format. If any associations have not collected all the forms distributed to their members, they should send staff to urge them to submit them, so that they can be collected and reported by this association. All should be completed within seven days of the date of this letter."</p>
<p>▲ Measures for the Office to Collect Taxes. The association also sent a letter to the Wusong, Jiangwan, and Pudong offices, stipulating measures for shops in the area to collect and pay business tax. The original letter stated: "Regarding the collection of business tax in Shanghai, which is entrusted by the Finance Bureau to this association for collection and payment, this association has resolved that all industries with trade associations will be entrusted by this association to the associations for collection and payment. For shops in this city that do not have a trade association, the business tax will be collected directly by this association. The majority of shops in the three offices' areas do not have trade associations. If all shops that should pay business tax directly to this association go to this association to pay, it will be troublesome for merchants. Since the office is a branch of this association, the collection and payment of business tax in the area of the office should be entrusted to the branch offices for simplicity. Here is a copy of the notice sent to the associations on August 22nd and the collection and payment measures. After receiving this letter, each office should estimate the total number of shops in the area and the approximate number of business return forms needed, and collect them from this association's distribution office. After collecting them, distribute them to each shop to fill out and report. All should be filled out and reported within one week of the distribution of the forms."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Recent News on the Dachang Steamer Collision Case <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Disagreement Prevents Amicable Settlement</p>
<p>The Navy Department States Jurisdiction Belongs to the Court</p>
<p>The case of the Dachang Steamer being sunk in a collision has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper due to its significant impact on the shipping industry. Both parties initially agreed to arbitration to resolve the matter. However, before arbitration could proceed, a contract needed to be established. The Shanghai Shipping Association convened three meetings with representatives from both sides, but no agreement was reached. This was because Dachang found the conditions proposed by Ping An Insurance Company to be harsh and unacceptable. The most contentious conditions are detailed below: (1) Arbitrators: Ping An insisted on a single arbitrator jointly appointed by both parties, while Dachang preferred each party to appoint one arbitrator, who would then jointly appoint a presiding arbitrator. (2) Guarantees: Ping An demanded a guarantee from Dachang, claiming it did not need to provide one itself because the ship existed. Dachang argued that arbitration conditions should be fair, with both parties providing cash guarantees or reliable commercial guarantees. (3) Scope: Ping An suggested limiting Dachang's losses to the ship's value, while Ping An’s own actual losses should be fully included. Dachang argued that the actual losses of both parties should be included, and the arbitrators should decide whether compensation was due, with no prior limitations imposed by either party. (4) Jurisdiction: Ping An insisted on designating a court, while Dachang argued that the arbitration should be final and binding, without the need for court designation. The differences between the two parties were significant, and their strong disagreements made resolution impossible. The case has been pending for months, with no arbitration in sight. Observers lamented the dispute between industry peers. Consequently, twenty fellow businesses jointly wrote to the Shipping Association, requesting the Association to arbitrate, arguing that during this period of recovering shipping rights, such arbitration should not fall into foreign hands. They pointed out that the Association's members included individuals knowledgeable in shipping and skilled in navigation, and requested the Association to convene the executive committee to select representatives to handle the case for a speedy resolution and to quell the industry dispute. Upon receiving the request, the Association sought opinions from both parties. Dachang responded favorably, but Ping An maintained its previous stance, resulting in no progress. Due to the prolonged delays and increasing losses, Dachang petitioned the Navy Department for arbitration. The Department replied that since the implementation of the Maritime Commerce Law this year, such cases fall under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities. During court proceedings, expert witnesses are appointed to assist the trial process, and the allocation of litigation costs is also governed by regulations. The Department also instructed the pilot training institute to provide guidance within its capacity. Dachang, facing the prospect of idle crew awaiting summons and mounting debts and interest, is reportedly planning to discuss effective countermeasures with relevant parties.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Comparison of Extreme High and Low Tides <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Highest Reached Forty-Two Feet</p>
<p>Since summer and autumn this year, continuous rain and frequent typhoons have led to severe flooding in various provinces, causing widespread death and injury, an unprecedented disaster. The local area has also experienced continuous rain for several days, turning rice paddies and low-lying fields into swamps. Rice plants are lying submerged in water, with unripened grains sprouting due to the water. A good autumn harvest is hopeless. The high tide has remained at a constant level throughout the day. The maximum height it reached is surely a matter of concern for the public. According to the tide gauge records kept by the Jianghai Customs House at Wusong Fort, the normal maximum water level in previous years was around thirty feet, and during large tides, it reached thirty-three to thirty-four feet. However, since the beginning of autumn this year, the normal level has already reached thirty-four feet, and large tides have reached thirty-seven feet or more, exceeding previous years by four to five feet. On the 25th of last month, during the heavy storm, the tide peaked over forty feet and remained high throughout the day. By 11 PM, it reached forty-two feet. Fortunately, the wind shifted to the northwest, and the water receded accordingly, preventing disasters between Songjiang and Shanghai. However, during the massive tide of the third day of the eighth lunar month in the 29th year of the Guangxu Emperor, the water level reached forty-three feet and five inches. That tide came unexpectedly, causing many deaths and injuries among the sandbar residents of Hengsha, Yawo Sha, Pingan Sha, and Shitou Sha. This time, casualties were also significant. Recently, during the evening tides of the past two days, the water level rose to thirty-three feet, and the daytime tides were slightly higher, but the water remained high throughout the day, receding by only one or two feet. Furthermore, this is a period of minor tides. It is feared that the tides could be even higher when major tides begin.</p>

<p>Schoolboy Returns Safely</p>
<p>A Mr. Xu, residing at No. 29 Xinzha Road, reported to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station yesterday afternoon around 4 PM that his private car, registration number 8086, and a schoolboy had suddenly disappeared, fearing a kidnapping. The police station immediately dispatched detectives to investigate. However, shortly after, the chauffeur drove the car back, and the boy was safe and sound. The commotion subsided. It is reported that Mr. Xu has three sons, all attending school. The eldest two attend a school on Jessfield Road, while the youngest attends a school on Avenue du Tonkin. Yesterday was the start of the school term, and all three boys needed to go to school. They departed together in the car around 1 PM. Before leaving, the master instructed the chauffeur to first take the youngest boy to Avenue du Tonkin and then to Jessfield Road, instructing the eldest two boys to return home in the same car. Unexpectedly, the chauffeur changed plans. After dropping off the two boys at Avenue du Tonkin, he did not go to Jessfield Road but instead took the third boy in the car for a leisurely drive on the road to pass the time. The two boys waiting at Avenue du Tonkin became anxious and returned home to inform their parents, who then reported the matter to the police station. Later, the chauffeur returned with the car, revealing the misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Pretends to Introduce Work</p>
<p>Luring Him to a Dark Alley to Commit the Crime</p>
<p>Xiao Lingbao, a Wuxi native residing at No. 40, Lane 3, Dinghe Lane, Yangshupu Road, was lured by his friend, Zhen Yongfang from Guangdong, on the pretext of introducing business, to a dark alley near the Huangpu Wharf around 11 PM on the 20th of last month. Zhen suddenly attacked Xiao with an axe, striking him on the head, causing him to fall to the ground. Xiao's wife, Zhang, who was following behind, was also injured on the head. She cried for help, and Huishan Police constables No. 859 and No. 935 rushed to the scene, apprehended Zhen, and seized the axe. They took him to the police station and sent the injured couple to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Zhen Yongfang was handed over to the Summary Court of the First Special District, awaiting Xiao's recovery for further adjudication. Now that Xiao Lingbao and his wife have recovered, the case was scheduled for further hearing yesterday. The presiding judge stated that the case should be handled by the local court, so it was transferred to the Third Criminal Court. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated that the two parties in this case had met and become acquainted while working on a foreign steamer. The defendant often visited the plaintiff's home and initially flirted with his wife, Zhang, eventually desiring to have an affair but lacking the opportunity. In March of this year, a can of gasoline was stolen from the ship. The defendant secretly reported to the foreign foreman, accusing the plaintiff of the theft. The plaintiff was detained and sentenced to four months of imprisonment by the court. The defendant then began an affair with Zhang. On July 30th, Xiao was released from prison after serving his term. The defendant instructed Zhang to murder her husband, but she failed. Therefore, on that evening, he plotted to lure the plaintiff to that location to carry out his vicious plan. According to the two Chinese constables, they apprehended the defendant at the scene and presented the murder weapon, an axe, for inspection. Plaintiff Xiao Lingbao testified that the defendant had asked him to wait at the entrance of the first house in the alley under the pretense of introducing work. Xiao believed him and asked his wife to buy cigarettes to give to his colleagues. His wife followed behind. As soon as they arrived in the alley, the defendant suddenly attacked Xiao's head with an axe, causing him to fall to the ground and cry for help. His wife, Zhang, stated that after her husband went to prison, she had an affair with the defendant, but she still pawned her possessions to make ends meet. After her husband was released from prison, the defendant told her to murder her husband by poisoning, stabbing, or any other means, otherwise he would kill her entire family, leaving not even a rat alive. She also briefly described the defendant's actions that night. When questioned, the defendant stammered and begged for leniency. Judge Shen Bingying, after reviewing the testimony, ordered him to be remanded in custody, with a date set for sentencing.</p>

<p>The representatives who went to the provincial capital to petition for the urgent repair of the Baoshan seawall, Ji Zhonghe, Gu Zhenyi, and Pu Weiran, returned to Shanghai and Baoshan yesterday. They reported that after arriving in the provincial capital, they separately visited Chairman Ye and Director Sun of the Construction Department and presented three demands: (1) Increase the allocation of funds for emergency repairs; (2) Allocate funds promptly and commence work by a specific date; (3) At least the most dangerous thousand-plus zhang of the project must be repaired before the third day of the eighth lunar month according to the lunar calendar. All secondary projects must be completed by the eighteenth day. Chairman Ye and Director Sun accepted all three points, promising to allocate significant funds and telegraph the Baoshan seawall project office to strictly comply.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Repercussions of Rent Increase in Baoyu Lane <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The property in Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, in the French Concession, belongs to Dehe Foreign Firm. The new buildings were renovated just over two years ago. Before the renovation, the rent for a single-unit building was only eighteen yuan per month. After the construction of the three-story buildings, the rent in the lane increased to sixty yuan per building. The tenants reluctantly bore the burden, fearing that they would struggle to make ends meet. The other day, they suddenly received a notice from Dehe Foreign Firm stating that from November 1st, the rent for each building would be increased to seventy-eight yuan. Upon reading the notice, the tenants were alarmed. At a time when various provinces are reporting severe droughts and commercial depression, and when rice and firewood are expensive, the landlord has suddenly increased the rent by as much as 30%, showing no consideration for business difficulties, making it difficult to accept. They have decided to convene a general meeting of tenant representatives within the next few days to discuss countermeasures and request the landlord to cancel the rent increase to ease the tenants' burden.</p>

<p>Seeking Return of Stolen Land Deeds and Gold Ornaments</p>
<p>Ye Qi, a former student at Fudan University, 21 years old, hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the Second Special District Court, claiming that the plaintiff had rented Room 16 of the Changjiang Apartment at No. 2 Caishi Lane, Caishi Street, in August of last year. Due to being implicated in a lawsuit in the French Concession due to a Mr. Zhu, she had a leather suitcase containing land deeds for over 40 mu of land and gold ornaments worth 400 yuan deposited with the apartment's accounting office, with Guo Jingpu issuing a receipt as proof. Now, when she went to retrieve the suitcase, the land deeds and gold ornaments inside were missing. She confronted Guo, who ignored her. Therefore, she sued according to Article 316 of the Criminal Law, requesting a summons for investigation and the return of the original items. Judge Ma Shounan held a hearing yesterday, but the defendant was absent. The plaintiff, Ye Qi, who was in the hospital giving birth, was represented by a lawyer who stated the facts of the case and stated that although the defendant was absent today, the Changjiang Apartment had changed its name, requesting that the summons still be delivered to the original address. Judge Ma ordered the summons to be re-issued for the defendant to appear in court for questioning and verification.</p>

<p>Improper Conduct and Reckless Affection</p>
<p>Former Lover Angrily Disfigures Her Face</p>
<p>Xu Jinbao, a woman of 39, had a romantic relationship with Lin Fengming from Vietnam, in her hometown, Jiahe. Although Lin was ten years older than Xu, she did not mind his age. They came to Shanghai together and rented a room to live together. However, life in Shanghai was extravagant, and Lin had no proper employment. Over time, they gradually struggled to make ends meet. Fortunately, Xu was still attractive, so she was introduced to work as a waitress at the Tianyun Lou in the Wing On Company. Due to the changing environment, her nature changed. Before long, rumors of her indecent behavior reached Lin's ears. Lin forced Xu to quit her job, but Xu, accustomed to a romantic lifestyle, could not bear to be restrained again. Thus, they quarreled. Lin, in extreme anger, suddenly bit Xu's face, tearing off a piece of flesh from her cheek. He then cut off the little finger and ring finger of his left hand. Later, after mediation, Xu agreed to give him thirty yuan per month, and Lin agreed not to have any further relationships with others, allowing her to continue in the same profession. Although Xu's cheek wound had healed, the scars were still visible. Unexpectedly, not long after, Lin learned that she was still behaving improperly and having reckless affairs, which he deemed unforgivable. Therefore, on the evening of the 26th of last month, he secretly brought a bottle of nitric acid and went to Tianyun Lou. Upon seeing her, he poured the acid on Xu's head to disfigure her face. After pouring the acid, he fled without a trace. In addition to reporting to the police, Xu went to the hospital for treatment. It was not until the other day that Lin was arrested by the police on Jiujiang Road. Both the victim and the suspect were sent to the First Special District Court, where presiding judge Zhou Hanting held a hearing. Police attorney Ru Baoyi stated the facts of the case, requesting that the defendant be punished under Article 294 of the Criminal Law. Xu Jinbao also recounted her relationship with the defendant and the two times she had been harmed by him. Judge Zhou then questioned the defendant and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Seducing a Married Woman <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Instigating Her to Flee with Clothes and Ornaments</p>
<p>Cai Xiqing, 48 years old, a merchant from Chuansha, residing at No. 803, Xinkang Lane, Jessfield Road in West Shanghai, had married a Ms. Wang through a matchmaker some years ago. After their marriage, the couple was deeply in love. However, in the first month of this year, Wang Laoer, who had recently moved in as a co-resident, secretly seduced Ms. Wang into an affair. Before long, Wang instigated her to flee with silver dollars, clothes, and ornaments. It was not until February that Cai found Wang and handed him over to the Sixth District Police Station. After questioning, he was transferred to the District Court. However, because Ms. Wang had not been found and brought to the court, and Wang denied the charges, he was released on bail. Now, after repeated inquiries, Cai Xiqing learned that Wang Laoer was still cohabiting with his wife at No. 4 Rongyang Lane, Wuding Road, in the Public Concession. Therefore, he went to that address in the rain the afternoon before yesterday. As Wang and his wife were frolicking, Cai barged in and apprehended them both, calling the police to arrest them and take them to the Gordon Road Police Station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, he ordered the detectives to transfer them to the Sixth District Police Station. After separate interrogations by the district chief, the plaintiff Cai Xiqing stated the above. Ms. Wang, 27 years old, stated that she had been married to Cai for just over a year. In the first month of this year, she was seduced by Wang Laoer, who was a co-resident, and was foolishly manipulated into fleeing with valuables and was sexually exploited. After he spent her silver dollars and pawned her clothes, she finally realized her mistake, but it was too late. She wanted to escape and return, but there was no opportunity. The defendant, Wang Laoer, 41 years old, a local resident, was charged with seducing and exploiting a married woman and defrauding her of property. He was subsequently sent to the District Court for trial along with a written statement.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has resumed operation of all up and down freight trains.

<h3 id="e118">The Guohua Electrical Appliances Store Case <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Decision Pending on September 8th</p>
<p>The Guohua Electrical Appliances Store at No. 418 Avenue Edward VII installed a wireless radio broadcasting system to play records and tell stories to entertain the audience and expand its business. However, the International Telecommunications Office of the Ministry of Transportation discovered that it was disrupting international telecommunications frequencies. It notified the French Concession police, who dispatched officers to search Guohua and seize the broadcast equipment. The case was referred to the Second Special District Court for trial. The defendant, Zhao Xuguo, the manager of Guohua, was represented by lawyer Xuan Zhendong. The court ordered a further hearing at a later date. The hearing was held on the appointed date and was presided over by Judge Wu Fanglian in the Criminal Court. First, Police Attorney Gu Shouxi stated the facts of the case, and Xu Zhuoyun, an employee of the International Telecommunications Office, representing the plaintiff, stated that the defendant had violated telecommunications regulations and requested an investigation. The defendant's lawyer stood up and requested permission to ask the plaintiff's representative a few questions, which the court allowed. He then asked Xu whether the twenty-plus other stores in Shanghai that had installed wireless radio broadcasting systems had registered, and why they were not investigated while Guohua was. Xu replied that the others had not received orders from the Ministry. He also asked whether it was because the Guohua Wireless Radio in Suzhou had disrupted international telecommunications frequencies and this had been mistaken for the Shanghai Guohua. Xu also denied this. The defendant's lawyer then argued that Guohua's installation of wireless radio was not illegal and requested that the defendant be declared innocent. He also presented a newspaper to the court. The judge ordered the arguments to be concluded and the decision to be made on September 8th.</p>

<p>Claiming to Be Detectives and Extorting Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Han Guang, a native of Yangzhou, claiming to be an associate of detective Chen Keqing of the Public Security Bureau, along with Zhang Xiaolai, Gao Xiaosi, and Wang Jiaxing, falsely investigated liquor taxes near Wuhua Road around 1 PM yesterday. Gao Boyuan, a clerk at the hotel opened by Chen Xinfu at No. 114 Wuhua Road, apprehended them and took them to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau for investigation. According to Gao, at the time, he had just purchased two jars of Shaoxing wine from the Concession and was passing Wuhua Road when Han Guang and the others stopped him, asking why he had not affixed liquor tax stamps and attempting to extort three or four silver dollars. When questioned, Han Guang claimed to be an associate of detective Chen, while the others stammered in their responses. After reviewing the testimony, Director Yao ruled that the detectives’ unauthorized use of police credentials was in violation of regulations. Furthermore, the inspection of liquor taxes was the responsibility of specialized personnel, not substitutes. He ordered them to be sent to the Judicial Section for handling to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>The China Jiande Society, recognizing the severity of the floods in various provinces, organized a four-day National Flood Relief Charity Variety Show, which opened at the society's Baixing Theater at 8 PM the night before last. Society President Wang Xiaolai presided over the opening ceremony as scheduled. The chairman reported on the severity of the disasters in various regions and the process by which the society initiated the charity variety show. He stated that to help the victims, one must focus on the concept of frugality: (1) eliminate domestic warfare; (2) the government should not employ useless people; (3) individuals should be frugal; (4) families should be frugal; (5) avoid useless activities and wishful thinking. If these five points can be implemented, money can be saved and used to help the disaster victims, which will undoubtedly have a significant impact. The variety show then began, featuring various singing and dancing performances, such as Zi Luolan's "Huo Xiaoyu," Yang Naimei's "Egyptian Dance," Mei Er's "Flower Selling Song," Yang Naimei and You Guanren's "Tango Dance," Liang Saisan and Saizhu's "Butterfly Girl," Liang Saihu's "Flying Swallow Dance," and the Riyue Troupe's "Seven Emotions." All of them were exceptionally brilliant. Yesterday, the society held the Shanghai Joint Music Conference, divided into daytime and evening sessions. Groups participating in the performances included the Datong Music Society, Sanyu Music Society, Huanan Music Society, Qingping Collection, China Music Society, China Harmonica Society, Lingdong New Music Society, Songbai Music Society, Xiaofei Orchestra, Jingwu Cantonese Music Group, the Society's National Music Society, Cantonese Music Troupe.

<p>Reader's Correspondence</p>
<p>A Message from Mr. Chen Daoli</p>
<p>When I was eight years old, my parents had already arranged a marriage for me. At the time, I was an innocent child, so I didn't realize it. Now, as time has passed, I have become an eighteen-year-old youth. My parents now want to marry me off. Because I am currently in a period of learning and am still young and unable to support myself, I would like to postpone this matter for another three or four years. However, my parents refuse to listen to my advice. Therefore, I am helpless and am considering running away when the time comes, but I feel that this is not appropriate. Other than this, I have no other way. Therefore, I am writing to you, sir, to ask if there is any way to delay this marriage or break off this engagement, because it was arranged by the "lotus flower under the tongue" of a matchmaker. No one knows anyone's appearance or character. All I know is that she is surnamed Zhao, her father is a farmer, her mother died a few years ago, and she is a country girl who has never received an education... to avoid suffering unpleasant consequences from this "blind man riding a blind horse" marriage and regretting it later.</p>
<p>A Message from Mr. Yan Xuefang</p>
<p>Now is a civilized era, with equality between men and women and freedom of marriage. However, under this system, many young people want to divorce their spouses and marry their lovers. But in the end, they do not get good results. In recent years, I was forced by an authoritarian family to marry an illiterate woman from an old-fashioned rural family. At that time, I was studying in Beijing and had no time to oppose my family, so my parents used authoritarian means to arrange the marriage. Now that the wedding is approaching, I feel that this old-fashioned woman is not suitable to be my life partner and want to break off the engagement. However, I often have financial difficulties and cannot realize this at the moment. Moreover, her parents are unwilling to break off the engagement with me, which makes me extremely miserable. Now, I request that you, sir, provide guidance and a reply in your newspaper.</p>
<p>(Combined Reply to Two Messages: Both messages concern marriage contracts. This matter should be discussed from two aspects. First, from a legal perspective, Article 973 of the Civil Code states that "men under the age of seventeen and women under the age of fifteen may not enter into a marriage contract." The marriage contract entered into by Mr. Chen when he was eight years old is invalid according to the current Civil Code. However, Article 4 of the Enforcement Act makes an exception to this article. Mr. Yan says, "My parents arranged the marriage when I was in Beijing." According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, a marriage contract should be entered into by the parties themselves. If Mr. Yan's marriage was not of his own free will, it can also be considered invalid. Furthermore, according to Article 975 of the Civil Code, a marriage contract cannot be forcibly enforced. In fact, rather than forcing a marriage and causing each other lifelong suffering, it is better to break off the engagement. This is not just from a theoretical point of view, but also because it is not in line with the principle of freedom. Secondly, from a human perspective, all parents love their children. Of course, one should still carefully investigate and consider the person chosen by one's parents, but one should not think that it is definitely not possible and hurt one's parents' feelings because of this. It would be uneasy on the conscience of a child. However, we also do not advocate combining casually. For example, if the other party has not received an education, then one may as well ask them to go to school. If other issues can be remedied, one should try one's best to remedy them. When there is no other choice, one should handle it according to the law. Young people should know that the person they choose themselves may not necessarily be good. Mr. Yan said it well, "Many young people who marry their lovers do not get good results.")</p>
<p>A Message from Mr. Chen Rixi</p>
<p>I am very interested in studying social sciences, but extensive purchases are limited by economic resources. In modern schools with tight budgets, library facilities are often incomplete. A small number of books cannot satisfy my desire to read. If I travel long distances to read, it will also take up time. How can I save money and time and have the opportunity to read? I hope you, sir, can tell me.</p>
<p>(Reply) It is not possible for an ordinary person to buy all the books he wants to read with his own strength. Libraries are set up to solve this problem. I don't know if there are any libraries near your school that can provide you with reading materials. If there are none, or if there are not enough, there is another way. You can form a reading club in school with students in your grade or other grades who are also studying social sciences. For example, if ten people each contribute five yuan, you can buy fifty yuan worth of books. The ten people can take turns reading, or bring old books together for public reading, so it's as if you are reading fifty yuan, or even more, worth of books for the price of five yuan. You will not only save money, but also gain the benefits and joy of learning together. Do you think this method will work? A Message from Mr. Chen Songliang</p>
<p>After graduating from elementary school in the 17th year of the Republic [1928], my parents ordered me to enter a small money exchange as an apprentice for a term of three years, with a subsidy of 180 yuan for board and lodging. Now the term has expired and I want to change careers. Looking back on the three years, the experience I have gained is only being able to distinguish banknotes, silver dollars, and cents. I don't understand accounting at all, because the accounts of small money exchanges are all handled by the old staff, and apprentices never see them. Although I usually read bookkeeping books, the circumstances of each industry are different. Now I am in a dilemma. Please provide a solution in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) In addition to gaining experience in identifying currency in the small money exchange for three years, you must also be familiar with business customs and all kinds of human relationships. You are also able to pay attention to bookkeeping books on weekdays. With this kind of eager-to-learn spirit, your future is promising. It is just that you should not easily change careers. We think it is more reasonable to find a way out in the money industry. Since your apprenticeship has expired, if you can get a basic clerk position, no matter how low it is, if you can serve diligently and try to make up for or study the knowledge and skills you should have in this industry in your spare time, it will not be difficult to make progress step by step. Mr. Chen, aren't the Rong brothers, the flour kings of Wuxi, from small money exchanges? I hope you will work hard.</p>

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Li Wenjie, a standing committee member of the association, and Mr. Xue Guangqian, the secretary, to inquire about everything. According to them, there are three major resolutions in the sixth meeting that need to be seriously discussed: (1) Whether to change the method of disposing of Japanese goods and find other appropriate means of transportation; (2) To study Mr. Que Pingzhi's proposal to urge industrial factories to step up production; (3) To discuss the proposal of the cotton cloth industry to classify cotton cloth made by Japanese merchants in Shanghai factories as necessities and raw cotton embryos as raw materials, and pay industrial funds in accordance with the regulations for raw materials and necessities to supervise the establishment of factories. The Five-Year Industrial Plan was previously reported by three gentlemen including Ji Yanfang. Due to the importance of the matter, it could not be drafted, but according to Mr. Li and Mr. Xue, it still needs to be submitted to the meeting for careful decision.</p>

<p>The Older Sister Arranges the Marriage for Her Younger Sister</p>
<p>Gao Jiansheng, who lives in Zhujiatang, Toutu, 28th Bao, South End of Hongqiao Town, West Shanghai, is nearly forty years old. His wife, Ms. Li, has not had any children. Gao Jiansheng is saddened by the lack of offspring and has long planned to take a concubine to continue the family line, but it has been difficult to find one for a while. However, Ms. Li has a younger sister (born of the same mother but a different father), named Lin Bao, who is graceful, beautiful, and intelligent, and is just twenty years old and not yet engaged. Gao Jiansheng obtained Ms. Li's consent and wanted to marry Lin Bao as a concubine. His wife, Ms. Li, was also willing to act as a matchmaker for her husband and make it a beautiful thing, but she was afraid that her mother would not agree. Therefore, Ms. Li tried to arrange it. Lin Bao was young and ignorant, with a weak will, and was also persuaded and enticed by her sister. Gao Jiansheng forcibly raped her, and it happened more than once. Recently, because she was secretly pregnant and her belly was gradually growing, her mother, Ms. Li Yu, discovered it. She severely questioned her daughter again and again, and finally, she told the truth. Her mother was furious and severely scolded her. Lin Bao then realized that she had been deceived by her sister, and her reputation was ruined. She was so heartbroken that she wanted to commit suicide several times, but she was rescued. It is now reported that Ms. Li Yu and Li Linbao, mother and daughter, have sued their son-in-law in the District Court for rape. The trial will be held soon.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Re-election Meeting of the Municipal Boy Scout Council <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Held at the Municipal Education Bureau Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Boy Scout Council of China held its first city-wide service personnel election meeting at the Municipal Education Bureau at 1:00 PM yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Staff: Presidium: Tong Xingbai, Xu Peihuang, Gu Zhengli; Master of Ceremonies: Wang Wenhua; Recorder: Luo Lie; Discipline: 196th Group (Liangjiang Girl Scouts)</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Order: 1. Opening; 2. Stand at attention; 3. Sing the Party song; 4. Bow to the Party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of the Premier; 5. Read the Premier's will respectfully; 6. Silent tribute; 7. Chairman's report; 8. Report on the work of the Municipal Boy Scout Council over the past year; 9. Speech by the representative of the China Boy Scout Headquarters; 10. Speech by the representative of the Municipal Party Committee; 11. Speech by the representative of the Municipal Government; 12. Speech by the representative of the Municipal Education Bureau; 13. Election; 14. Vote Counting; 15. Adjournment</p>
<p>▲ Number of Attendees: Representatives and election supervisors from the China Boy Scout Headquarters, Tong Xingbai; representative from the Municipal Party Committee, Zhu Jiarang; representative from the Municipal Government, Chen Kecheng; representative from the Municipal Education Bureau, Zhou Shang; and over a hundred city-wide service personnel.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Report: Chairman Gu Zhengli reported, stating that he had recently traveled to Japan to inspect Boy Scout activities and lectured in Beiping for a considerable amount of time, so he was not very familiar with the recent Boy Scout situation in Shanghai. He felt ashamed that he was unable to give a comprehensive report, but he hoped everyone would understand. The number of attendees has reached the legal quorum, so he declared the grand meeting open.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives' Speeches: Representative of the China Boy Scout Headquarters, Tong Xingbai, stated that he was sent by the Boy Scout Headquarters to attend the election supervision and offer a few words for reference. Although the Boy Scout cause is led by both the Party and the government, the Boy Scout community itself must work hard to achieve success. In the past, the Boy Scouts in this city lacked a sound organization, making it difficult to develop. Therefore, the Party and the government had to take charge and find ways to support it. Now that the Council has been established and the Boy Scouts in this city have a central organization, the selection of council members is done by the Boy Scout community, not appointed by the Party and the government. This shows that the entire responsibility of the Boy Scout cause is being gradually handed over to you. The Party and the government are only providing support. As your responsibilities are greater than before, you should work harder to ensure a sound organization and a great strength, so that the Boy Scout cause in this city can make significant progress. In terms of the election, the Headquarters has clearly stated on the ballot to select the virtuous and capable. It is hoped that everyone can carefully select the virtuous and capable based on this intention. Representative of the Municipal Party Committee, Zhu Jiarang, stated that he was representing the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee to participate in the second election meeting of the Municipal Boy Scout Council. Recalling the first election meeting held at the Municipal Party Committee on October 5 last year, the organization of the Council had not yet been established, and the Shanghai Boy Scout cause had not yet been systematically developed. The command organization had not been formally established, and everything else could not proceed step by step on the right track. At that time, due to ideological differences, there were unfortunate misunderstandings, and the spirit of true unity could not be achieved, making the entire glorious and sacred Boy Scout cause appear bleak. At that time, the Municipal Party Committee, under the orders of the Central Committee and the entrustment of the China Boy Scout Headquarters, overcame all difficulties and made every effort to rectify the situation. After repeated discussions and clarifications, they were advised to cultivate morality and pursue perfection. On the one hand, they tried to eliminate all the wrong views in the Boy Scout community to create a harmonious atmosphere. On the other hand, they actively prepared to organize the Council to provide the Shanghai Boy Scouts with a central and unified command organization. All the Boy Scouts' efforts would have a center and a destination. Based on this principle, the Council's organizational regulations promulgated by the Headquarters were followed on October 5 last year, and the Municipal Party Committee convened city-wide service personnel to elect the first Council, which was officially established as the Shanghai Municipal Boy Scout Council of China. To this day, eleven months have passed, and the second election is being held today, and the second Council will be produced. This shows that all comrades in the city's Boy Scout community can make joint efforts based on the foundation of the past rectification by the Party Committee. They have corrected all the past negative phenomena and created today's atmosphere of one mind and one heart, sincerity and unity, and prosperity. This is what I am determined to do today after participating in this meeting and recalling the past eleven months. The extension of the Council's election is due to factual reasons, and it is being held today. The past work should be reported to the public by the Council, and we should conduct a rigorous inspection and criticism based on its work progress. At the same time, we can also point out its direction. We must know that the reason why the Boy Scouts are not directly commanded by the Party Committee but are subordinate to the Council is because the Party respects the Boy Scout cause. Because the Boy Scout cause is specialized knowledge, it must be directly led by an organization like the Council. The Party is only responsible for supervision and guidance. Therefore, the quality of the Council's work and the virtue and ability of the council members should be examined and selected by all the service personnel themselves. Today's meeting has such an important mission. All our service personnel comrades should understand and pay serious attention to this. As for today's election of council members, it is closely related to the rise and fall of the city's Boy Scout cause in the future. Everyone should stand firm, hold firm to their intentions, and take the two words "virtue" and "ability" as the sole standard. Focus on the four words printed on the ballot (select the virtuous and capable). Our first condition is naturally the word "virtue." If the individual has indeed excellent scholarship, high morality, and a deep understanding of Party principles and Boy Scout discipline, then we can elect him. Secondly, we must ask whether this person, though virtuous, is capable. Because being a Boy Scout council member requires practical work. If the individual has excellent talent but lacks ability, or if he has ability but cannot work in the Council due to being busy or other reasons, then we should not elect this person. There is also the kind of person who has a long history but only has a false reputation, who is unwilling to work or is incompatible with emotions, does not abide by discipline, and is good at manipulating people. We should not elect him either, because this kind of person cannot do practical work for the Council and may even disrupt things. You yourselves know how to choose your future leaders. The Party's hope and the will of the masses are probably the same as your original ideas. Finally, we wish that today five truly popular and well-deserved council members can be produced to move the Boy Scout cause in Shanghai a big step forward on the road of progress. The great torch will shine all over China and the world. Done. Representative of the Municipal Government, Chen Kecheng, said that he was very happy to represent the Municipal Government at the meeting. The Municipal Government attaches great importance to the Boy Scout cause. The initial financial assistance is proof of this. The Boy Scouts are not only a public cause but also a national cause. Because it is a national cause, it should not only be internal but also external. I believe everyone understands this. The Municipal Government places the Boy Scouts in the education cause and is managed by the Education Bureau, which should have a development plan. In the past, the Municipal Government believed that the most satisfactory thing in everyone's efforts was that everyone could unite and jointly develop the Boy Scout cause. However, there is still a long way to go, and we must continue to work hard. It is hoped that today's election results will continue this spirit and make the Boy Scout cause thrive. As for the election standards, the representatives of the Headquarters and the Municipal Party Committee have already said that it is the two words "virtue" and "ability." "Virtue" means doing things for everyone instead of for oneself. "Ability" means being capable and doing things correctly. It is hoped that the next Council will work harder. Representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, Zhou Shang, said that the most dangerous thing in the world is the absence of virtue and ability. Therefore, in today's election, we must pay special attention to the two words "virtue" and "ability." Secondly, we must also pay attention to the Boy Scouts' own goals. We must pay attention to the path we are taking, which is to save people. We must first be able to save ourselves before we can go and save others. In this regard, we should pay special attention to our own cultivation and training.</p>
<p>▲ Election Results: Wang Gang 72 votes, Gu Zhengli 52 votes, Leng Xueqiao 33 votes, Qu Yue 29 votes, Xu Zicheng 26 votes. The above five people were elected as council members. The next most votes: Zhang Xunfang 24 votes, Yu Kuikui 23 votes, Zhao Weizu 19 votes. The above three people were elected as alternate council members. The election ballots were checked and found to be correct, and the representative of the Headquarters and the chairman sealed and signed them together, and the report will be submitted to the Headquarters for record.</p>

<p>Registration Closes at 4 PM Today</p>
<p>No Extension Will Be Granted. Pay Attention If You Wish to Participate.</p>
<p>Today at 4 PM is the deadline for registration for the second Shanghai City-Wide Sports Meet. However, fate is playing tricks on us. Heavy rain has been pouring down for days, and the streets are flooded, leading to exclamations of "It's impossible to walk!" Those members of the city's various ball teams and track and field athletes who wish to go to the Municipal Education Bureau on Dajilu, Nanshi, to register are inevitably thinking of waiting for another day. Therefore, the past two days have not seen much enthusiasm. However, today is the last day for registration. If this opportunity is missed, there will be no way to showcase their dragon-like leaps and tiger-like prowess, and no way to express their enthusiasm for promoting amateur sports. Therefore, the reporter predicts that even if the weather continues to be adverse today, various ball teams and athletes will still brave the rain to register with the spirit of struggle in sports.</p>

<p>The Nanjing Central Military Academy basketball team played against the Artillery team last night at the China Basketball Hall. The Military Academy won by four points, with a final score of 29 to 25. The Artillery team lost. The referee was Shao Ji.</p>

The Military Academy won the first half with a score of 18 to 8. In the second half, the Artillery team launched a fierce counterattack, chasing the score to 20 to 24, only four points behind. They then chased the score to 23 to 25, and then to 25 to 27, only two points behind. Unfortunately, the Military Academy scored another point, resulting in a final score of 25 to 29, with the Military Academy winning.</p>
<p>▲ The Military Academy is Brave and Good at Fighting. The Military Academy's players are tall and strong, with the power of northerners. Therefore, they are all brave and good at fighting, and their attacks are very fast. They are not very good at holding the ball, missing many opportunities and committing many fouls. Their dribbling is not very skillful. Due to the smaller size of the Artillery team, they lost mainly in defense in the first half, but they performed very well in the second half, especially Liao Lie, who was commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Financial: Last Week's Bid Gold Softened <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>▲ The bid gold fell back 11 taels and 8 mace, and the volatility was still quite large, with unpredictable ups and downs of 4 or 5 taels to 7 or 8 taels per day. This was because overseas news was complicated, and both long and short positions had mutual restraints, but people were still hesitant. At the beginning of the week, it was outside 780 taels, and then it hovered uncertainly. On Thursday morning, it reached 85 taels and 8 qian, and then it showed a potential decline. On Saturday, it suddenly became 70 taels and 02 qian. The total difference in this week was 15 taels and 6 qian. Compared with the previous few weeks, it fell back 11 taels and 8 qian. The silver market was slightly shrinking, and the Shanghai exchange rate did not rise or fall, but the internal situation seemed loose. However, hedging was not smooth, so there were very few transactions. As of Friday, gold firms such as Yongheng, Xinheng, Hengxing, Yuanbingxing, and exchange rate hedging were all bullish, while the Dalian gang, Guangdong gang, Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yongyuan, Kangxiang, spot firms, and bankers were all bearish. Speculator Wu was also bearish. Recently, the amount of exchange slips was about 47,000 to 48,000 slips. After more than 10,000 slips of spot goods were shipped out the previous week, there was no further movement. However, as usual, a considerable amount of September's public bills should be settled on September 1st, and some banks received them. However, bare slips were not sold well, and only Yingfeng, Hengtongfeng, Yongdeng, and other firms received a little. The price increased by 7 to 7.5 taels according to the bid gold. The market was mediocre as usual. The closing price was about 30 taels based on the daily gold calculation, and even 40 taels at the weekend. The situation during the week is summarized below:</p>
<p>▲ Daily fluctuations were large. On Monday (August 31), the large silver bar shrank by 1.25, and the US silver also fell by 1.25. The foreign exchange rate was stable, and the internal situation was slightly loose. The industry sold slightly. The initial bid gold for October opened at 1.8 qian, at 783 taels and 8 qian, followed by 4.7 qian. Later, it was learned that the UK's borrowing from the US and France might be successful, and the British gold defense minister was reassured. It plummeted by more than 6 taels, only counting 78 taels. Afterwards, it rose by more than 3 taels, returning to outside 80 taels, counting 81 taels and 5 qian, due to a certain bank purchasing slips. The afternoon closing returned to 79 taels and 3 qian. In the afternoon, the Indian exchange rate increased, shrinking to 77 taels and 2 qian, then to 9.5 qian. The closing price was 78 taels, falling back 4 taels compared to the previous Saturday. The daily difference was 7.5 taels, and Wu sold some. The next day, the large silver bar returned to 0.0625 to 1.25, the silver price increased by 1.25, the foreign exchange rate did not change, and the internal situation seemed to increase. The gold market initially opened at 777 taels and a half, slightly smaller by 5 qian, followed by 8.4 qian. Then, due to strong selling pressure, speculator Lu sold, shrinking to 74 taels and 3 qian, with a fluctuation of 2 taels. The afternoon closing was 7 taels and 6 qian. The afternoon opened at 78 taels, followed by 8.8 qian, and then rose from 7.2 qian to 81 taels because the foreign exchange rate was firm and there were still many buyers. Then, due to large households selling off, it shrunk to 5.7 qian. The closing price was 6 taels and 8 qian, continuing to fall by 1.2 qian compared to the previous day. The total fluctuation in the front and back markets was 6.7 qian. On Wednesday, the large silver bar and foreign exchange rate did not change, and the internal market was tight. Chinese merchants settled first and then hedged. The initial bid gold increased by 3.5 taels, to 80 taels and 03 qian, because the US was inclined to sell in the silver market, and there were also telegrams of several banks in the US going bankrupt. Due to more selling, it fell to 78 taels and 5 qian. Later, due to Wu chasing up, it rose to 83 taels. Suddenly, there was news that India was buying silver to cover short positions, and people were immediately unsure, falling by 4 taels, to 79 taels and 1 qian. The afternoon closing returned to 81 taels and 4 qian. In the afternoon, retail buyers came in, touting it to 83 taels and 5 qian. The closing price was 3 taels and 1 qian, falling back 6 taels and 3 qian, with a fluctuation of 5 taels. On Thursday, the large silver bar shrank by 0.0625 to 1.25, the US silver slightly went by 1.25, the foreign exchange rate was stable, and the internal situation was slightly loose. Due to the news of the silver price meeting, people were shocked. The gold market opened at 84 taels and a half, immediately adding 1.4 qian. Then, because the US still had silver to sell and US stocks also fell, it also rose to 85 taels and 8 qian. Due to the US saying it would convene a silver meeting, large households such as Wu dumped it, and the situation quickly turned down, breaking into the 80 taels level. At noon, it was only 76 taels and a half. The afternoon closing was 8 taels and 4 qian. The afternoon opened at 7 taels and 2 qian. Afterwards, all firms sold, and the exchange rate was also loose and excessive, suddenly becoming 73 taels. Afterwards, it pulled up more than 3 taels, and the closing price was 74 taels and 6 qian, falling back 8 taels and a half compared to the previous day. Each firm's supply exceeded demand, and the total difference in the front and back markets was 12 taels and 8 qian. The next day, the large silver bar increased by 0.0625, the silver price increased by 1.25, the foreign exchange rate did not change, and the internal situation shrank. The industry slightly dug. As for the gold market, it opened with an increase of 3 taels, to 77 taels and 6 qian, followed by 8.2 qian. Because the US had sold again and US stocks had fallen, people were reassured, but there were many short positions sold, retreating to 4.8 qian. Large households chased up, rising to 79 taels. At noon, Wu sold off, falling to 76 taels. The noon closing was 7 taels and 1 qian. The afternoon was 5 taels and 8 qian, opening at 7 taels and 6 qian. The closing price was 76 taels and 9 qian, returning to a high of 2 taels and 3 qian. Transactions were limited. That day was only 4 taels and 2 qian. On Saturday, the large silver bar and exchange rate did not rise or fall, the internal market was slightly higher, and the industry sold slightly. The initial bid gold was 77 taels and a half. Afterwards, there was more selling, especially because the silver price meeting would be held in Paris on the 17th of this month, so people were hesitant. The noon closing was 70 taels and 02 qian, falling back 6 taels and 7 qian compared to the previous day. The fluctuation in half a day was 7 taels and 3 qian. Yesterday (Sunday), the large silver bar increased again by 0.0625 to 1.25, and today's bid gold may fall straight down. The high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets and exchange rates are described below:</p>

<h3 id="e166">Securities: Last Week's Bond Prices Fell Sharply <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Unified Tax Bonds Fell About 2 Yuan and 2 Jiao</p>
<p>20 Customs Bonds Also Fell 1 Yuan and 45</p>
<p>The market conditions of various bonds in the securities market in Shanghai last week: spot transactions were even more scarce than before, with only 14,000 yuan traded in a week. Futures were more active than the previous week, and the market sentiment was very lively. The inflow and outflow of important bonds were very active. Even the newly auctioned salt tax treasury bonds gradually occupied a position in the market. The futures for this and next month have all been opened. The daily transaction volume was relatively clear only on Monday, with a total of 6.1 million yuan traded. Afterwards, the daily volume was quite good, with 10 million yuan on Tuesday and 17 to 18 million yuan on Wednesday and Thursday. The weekend volume was about 15 million yuan. The total volume for the week was 81.39 million yuan, an increase of 29.3 million yuan compared to the previous week. The unified tax bonds were still the most active, accounting for 30.345 million yuan, with 22.865 million yuan for the September contract and 7.48 million yuan for the October contract. The 20 Customs bonds also reached 18.9445 million yuan, with 15.435 million yuan for the September contract and 3.5 million yuan for the October contract. However, other bonds were generally stable, such as 7.03 million yuan for 20 Cigarette, 5.325 million yuan for 19 Customs, 3.42 million yuan for 19 Charity, 5.915 million yuan for Disarmament, 3.3005 million yuan for Reorganization, and the rest were scarce, with 460,000 yuan for Customs Duty, 455,500 yuan for 6% Reorganization, 365,000 yuan for 96 Public Bonds, 5,000 yuan for Finance, and 5.76 million yuan for Salt Tax, with 5.515 million yuan for the September contract and 245,000 yuan for the October contract. As for the trend of various bonds, although the situation in the north has calmed down, the national disasters are extremely large. Although there was news of peace in Guangdong before, there has been no further development. In addition, the national treasury needs a large amount of money, and new bonds continue to be issued. All of these are enough to weaken the market sentiment, and the issuance of new bonds especially affects the market's supply and demand. Therefore, the bond market situation last week was worse than before. Large households were cautious and did not dare to make large-scale purchases. The buying sentiment was always dominant in the market. In the first two days of the week, although the prices hovered downward, the fluctuations were extremely small. On Wednesday, due to some selling, the demand and supply were very different, and the prices fell sharply. Salt tax fell by 2 yuan and 78 jiao, 20 Customs bonds fell by more than 2 yuan, and others fell by 1 or 2 jiao. Although it rebounded on Thursday, the prices of unified tax and salt tax bonds were still low. In the last few days of the week, the market was in a chaotic state, with very small fluctuations. Judging from the trend, there will not be any major ups and downs for the time being. The statistics of the high and low price fluctuations of each bond in the past week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US and Indian cotton markets were closed for holidays. English cotton futures fell 3-4 points, spot fell 4 points, and Egyptian cotton spot fell 5 points. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 5th):</p>
<p>English Cotton Compared to the Previous Day Complies with Shen Regulations January 3634 33.30</p>

<h3 id="e168">Last Week, Both Futures and Spot Yarn Fell More Than 2 Taels <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was calm at the beginning of the week. Because merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan continued to purchase coarse yarn, some of the coarse yarn was almost completely collected, so the market sentiment could be maintained for a while. Then, the US No. 3 cotton yarn tended to decline, and the decline was severe, with a tendency to fall without end. At the same time, the floods in all directions became more serious, and speculators generally expected that the actual demand in the future would be greatly affected. Therefore, there were more sellers, and the market sentiment declined. However, a certain manufacturer's majority shareholder remained still. However, many retailers saw the bad environment and had to cut losses. The market fell sharply at the weekend. However, a certain large businessman slightly compensated when it fell. The price of standard yarn fell by more than 2 taels compared to last week, approaching the 50 taels mark. The transaction statistics were 121,550 bales. The spot sales to Sichuan merchants were healthier, and other sales were average. According to statistics, all merchants bought 5,465 bales, and 650 bales were traded among industry members. The market price fell by more than 2 taels. Japanese merchants opened a large number of futures bales, with more than 10,000 bales. The factory opened very few. Osaka No. 3 yarn fell by 5.6 yuan compared to last week. The number of bales purchased by each merchant is listed below:</p>
<p>Merchant Number of Bales Merchant Number of Bales Merchant Number of Bales</p>
<p>Hankou 220 Guangdong 110 Northern Merchants 100</p>

<h3 id="e169">Last Week, the Cotton Market Rose First and Then Fell <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market rose sharply at the beginning of the week, because foreign cotton was set, the weather in Shanghai was bad, and the flood in Hankou damaged a large area of ​​cotton fields. There were wind and rain disasters in all directions, and the year's prospects were greatly diminished. Therefore, cotton merchants generally purchased a lot, and the number of bales was very large, so each month saw 5 taels. Before long, US cotton stepped downward, and the decline became more severe, so people became hesitant again. However, the autumn rain in Shanghai was drizzling and did not stop for several days, slightly bringing up the market sentiment at about 4 taels and 2-3 qian. At the weekend, the weather showed signs of clearing, but US cotton still fell and did not return, and Japanese merchants also closed, so the market fell sharply by 5-6 qian. In short, the world cotton industry is sluggish, and the pressure is getting heavier. The total transaction statistics for the week were 500,750 dan. The prices for each month were similar to those of the previous week, and the prices for distant months fell by 3-4 qian. The spot price of local cotton was high, and there were very few transactions. There was more foreign cotton, and the price of US cotton fell by 45 pounds per tone compared to the previous week. The source of Yao cotton at the wharf was estimated to be 1,250 bales. The amount purchased by each factory is listed below:</p>
<p>Manufacturer Incoming Highest Price Lowest Price Number of Transactions Deadline</p>

<p>The Blow of Little Rain</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday, the source of various merchants in Nanshi was due to the lack of proper days, and the arrival at the port was even rarer. There was wind and rain in the morning in urban and rural stores, and there were still few buyers in the market. The banks chose skillfully to take a little, and there were few high transactions. However, the cargo owners saw that there was too much rain, and the origin of the cargo gradually tightened. The market of thick japonica rice added 3-4 jiao. The thin indica rice had a little bit of river deposits, and the Ning market had been stagnant for a long time. The sales of this street felt a little more active, so the price suddenly increased by 5-6 jiao. The sales of Luxiang rice were average, and the price did not rise or fall. The price of new japonica rice was rare, and the price rose by 7-8 jiao.</p>
<p>▲ There has been too much rain recently at Xinzha, and there are few boats arriving on the west road. Due to the wind and rain in the morning, there were slight transactions until the afternoon. The market price of each cargo jumped by about half a yuan. The customer side's letter is related to the body, and there are no boats coming from the back road. The price of Zhongguan thick japonica rice rose by half a yuan. Luxiang is affected by Taizhou rice, and the situation is difficult to improve. The arrival and sale of glutinous rice are two enemies, and the market is tightened. The route of foreign rice to the customer side and this street moved slightly, and the situation seemed to be tightened.</p>

<p>The Influence of the Decline of Coarse Sand and White Walk</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from the sugar market producing area. The market planning of the association's market was in full swing due to the Dutch sugar, and the popularity was greatly weakened, and the buying intention was even more sluggish. The market price therefore fell again. The price of new cargo of Dutch sugar No. 24 was still 11 taels and 7 qian and a half, but the acceptance was extremely quiet. The price of 20 medium sand white was 11 taels and 1 qian and a half, and the price of high cargo was 11 taels and 4 qian, but few people asked. The price of Taikoo Car Sugar B mark was 11 taels and 9 qian and a half, the price of DY mark was 11 taels and 4 qian and 7 qian and a half, the price of HX mark was 11 taels and 7 qian, and the price of HM mark was 11 taels and 4 qian to 3 qian and 7 qian and a half. There were not many transactions, and the market was flat. There was dumping of Dutch sugar. Hua Xin Hao opened 200 tons of old coarse sand white of September and October yesterday. The price was Dutch currency 5 yuan, 6 jiao, 2 fen and a half. Nanshenglong also sold 200 tons of new cargo at a price of 5 yuan and 5 jiao, which could be telegraphed. As a result, the coarse sand white market was even more sluggish.</p>

<p>The Factory's US Sales Rose Slightly... The Weekend's Telegram Was Not Weak</p>
<p>Although Overseas Silk Prices Rose... The Exchange Rate Shrunk, and the Pull Price Was Not High</p>
<p>Last week, the transactions of silk through foreign firms in Shanghai gradually became active. It has been a long time since the US sales of Shanghai white factory silk stagnated, counting five or six months. As the demand for winter silk gradually increased, each silk factory started to handle it during the week. The sales of factory silk in the New York market were quite active in the first half of the week. 2,000-3,000 bales of spot silk were traded, and the inventory gradually thinned. The weekend's telegram was not weak, and the transaction of Class B level telegrams was estimated at 1,000-2,000 bales. Although overseas silk prices were generally reported to be rising on the surface, the exchange rate still shrank, and the pull price was still only 960-70 taels. The factory side, due to the silk's own factors, had several negotiations, and now part of it has been obeyed. The fine factory silk of British and French firms has also been traded, and the market seems to be turning around. Several hundred bales of spot silk were traded in the middle of last week, and only more than 500 bales of spot silk were exported. The list of market prices of Chinese silk in overseas markets at the end of last week is listed below (New York's price per pound is in US dollars, and Lyon's price per kilogram is in francs):</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Big Fat Man <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Last year, a big fat man came to the New World. His name was Jolly Ray. He weighed more than five hundred and sixty pounds, three and a half times my weight. So I cut out his photo and wrote a playful poem, sending it to a small school for Chinese and arithmetic practice. My playful poem is:</p>
<p>(Jolly woman, fat within fat: Weighs five hundred and sixty pounds. Compare her to me, three and a half!)</p>
<p>This poem and photo were sent with a letter. In the letter, I hoped that the children would weigh themselves, calculate, and compare themselves with Ms. Jolly, changing the fourth line and sending it back to me. Then, I would have something to send them next time.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Undermining the Stage <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>A certain university professor likes to show off and holds many part-time positions, earning more than a thousand yuan per month. But after securing the positions, his energy couldn't keep up, leading to a complete mess. As a result, one of his jobs was terminated. My friend took over the position, performing his duties loyally and without avoiding hard work. The professor was very unhappy and repeatedly caused trouble in secret. My friend told me everything, so I wrote a portrait for this professor. This professor is truly representative. People like him can be found everywhere in society. In a diligent society, lazy people are not allowed to linger; in a lazy society, diligent people are not allowed to establish themselves. What kind of society is China?</p>
<p>(Loves to play leading roles in plays; but lazy to take responsibility after getting the role. When others perform a good play, they secretly tear down the stage.)</p>
<h3 id="e184">Japanese Commerce in Qingdao <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Nangong Sheng</p>
<p>Recently, the Wanbaoshan incident has not yet been resolved. The Qingdao National Essence Society is also picking quarrels with Chinese people. The ambition of the Japanese is evident here. The Japanese operate with great effort in Qingdao, treating it as a colony. Therefore, newspapers run by the Japanese have absurd discussions of re-leasing Qingdao to Japan. Chinese people should pay attention to this and curb their ambition.</p>
<p>Qingdao was initially leased to Germany. The Japanese took it for themselves during the European War. Later, they were forced by the Washington Conference to reluctantly return it to our country. However, the rights to the Jiaoji Railway are still in the hands of the Japanese. The essence of the entire port has also been moved elsewhere by the Japanese. After the Japanese defeated the German army and seized power, it took several years to return it to our country. During those years, more than one hundred thousand Japanese moved to Qingdao. All businesses are controlled by the Japanese. The number of shops is unmatched by any other place. If you stand on the high ground of the island and look around, you only see short houses like combs, and the sound of wooden clogs is everywhere. These are all houses built by the Japanese.</p>
<p>The businesses run by the Japanese are comprehensive, including theaters and brothels. The most prosperous areas of Qingdao are Shandong Road (now renamed Zhongshan Road) and Sifang Road, with Shandong Road being the most important. Most of the shops are run by the Japanese. Confectioneries, clothing stores, restaurants, etc., are everywhere. Japanese shop signs are everywhere. Approximately every ten zhang, you can see a shop set up by the Japanese. The Japanese in Qingdao buy everything at shops set up by the Japanese. Therefore, business is very prosperous. This also shows the patriotic spirit of the Japanese. The Chinese people are far from being their match. Outside Shandong Road, there is also the so-called Japanese Quarter, southwest of Dabaodao. All the houses are Japanese-style. All the shops are set up by the Japanese. There are many restaurants, information centers, brothels, and coffee shops. The shop assistants employed in the shops are also Japanese women. Looking around, it's as if you have entered Japanese territory. It is appropriate for the Japanese to regard it as a colony.</p>
<p>The Qingdao vegetable market is gathered at the small vegetable market. The vegetable shops set up by the Japanese are in a ratio of two to one compared to the Chinese. The market is divided into three floors. The first and second floors are half Chinese and half Japanese. The third floor is entirely Japanese shops, selling toys. Many Chinese buy them. It is said that thirty thousand yuan leaks out in a year. From this, we can see the invasion of the Japanese. Even something as small as a toy is so huge. Shouldn't we be afraid?</p>
<p>When the Japanese held power in Qingdao, they planted their national flower, the cherry blossom, all over the island. In the First Park, the Shinto shrine, and the other five parks, tens of thousands of cherry trees were planted. Every year in February and March, the snow-white blossoms are magnificent. The Japanese still promote the Cherry Blossom Festival. At that time, all the Japanese in the city are crazy and ecstatic, as if they are in their own country. Stalls are set up everywhere, creating another large business area for the Japanese.</p>
<p>Japanese commerce in Qingdao can be described as meticulous. Even pawnshops are capitalized by the Japanese. Because the Chinese people are afraid of the power of the military, they dare not set up pawnshops. The Japanese take their place. The interest rates are unparalleled, reaching seven points per yuan. The poor people have no choice but to drink poison to quench their thirst, painfully going to pawn their belongings. Moreover, the deadline is only two months. As a result, the Japanese accumulate profits, all from the blood and sweat of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Invention of Talking Love Letters <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Recently, the progress of science in Western countries is astonishing. And recently in the United States, there has been the invention of talking letters. The so-called talking letters can transmit both images and sound. Young men and women are using them to send love letters. This matter caused a sensation, and it is especially lively in New York City. The person sending the letter enters a small room and speaks into a microphone. A short letter takes only one and a half minutes. If the letter is longer, the time is extended accordingly. When speaking, the green light comes on first, then the white light, indicating that the time is almost up, with only twenty seconds remaining. Stop talking when you see the red light. As for the recorded language, it is engraved into lines with a diamond to transmit the image. Currently, there are six institutions in New York City that provide this service. The number of people sending letters is increasing daily. In addition to young men and women using it to send love letters, other sectors, such as merchants ordering goods and pastors preaching, also use it to transmit or report messages in emergencies. It is incredibly convenient. However, this kind of machine has not been invented for long, and if the person sending the letter is not familiar with science, it is inconvenient to send it. Therefore, it is not yet widespread.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Traces of the Iron Ox <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Chezun</p>
<p>I once served in the Huaiyang Military Headquarters. Whenever there was a task, I had to follow, enduring the hardships of travel. I almost covered the north and south banks of the Yangtze River and both sides of the Grand Canal. Mapeng Bay is about seven or eight li away from Qingshui Pool, with Tie Niu Bay (Iron Ox Bay) in between. I have visited that place several times and often lingered and gazed at it. The iron ox is shaped like a regular ox, with its four hooves bent and resting on the ground, its head raised to the right, as if looking at something. To the right of the Guan帝 Temple in Shaobo Town, there is also an iron ox, similar in appearance to the ox in Tie Niu Bay. Near Gaoliangjian on the edge of Hongze Lake, there are nine iron oxen, each about one or two li apart, commonly known as Jiu Niu Bay (Nine Ox Bay). My sister's husband, Mr. Deng, lives by the lake and is a member of the River Works Committee. Therefore, I had the opportunity to see the nine iron oxen in person. However, the meaning of their placement is unclear. When I asked the local people, some said that the iron ox was to drive away monsters. In the past, when Xu Zhenjun pursued and captured water monsters, he rode a divine ox. When the monster saw Zhenjun, it was terrified and ran away. Seeing an ox lying on the embankment, it assumed Zhenjun was there and dared not stop running. Others said that the water could not pass over the ox's nose, which proved to be true. Every time you see oxen crossing a large river, their noses are raised out of the water. Casting oxen is a way to show the method of suppression. This is what is passed down. I don't know which is correct. According to my research, the Gaojia Weir was once breached by the Yuan people. At that time, it was planned to flood the area to ambush Zhu Taizu who was going to Lixiahe. The water went straight to Suzhou's Changmen. All the counties in Huaiyang became a vast ocean. Later, as the water gradually receded, the residents of Yanfu and Dongxing counties were all moved from Suzhou, planting grass as markers to divide the land for planting. When Zhu Ming established the dynasty and repaired the Gaojia Weir, Mr. Liu Qingtian surveyed the area and assessed the situation. All the iron oxen were cast by Qingtian and placed in selected locations. The meaning was undoubtedly to suppress flooding. This year's floods are so severe, unseen in a century. Whether the iron oxen can limit the effect of flooding is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Miscellaneous Notes from Japan <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Aiai, sent from Tokyo</p>
<p>Summer in Tokyo</p>
<p>A fiery sun blankets the boundless earth. This is the season of suffering for the poor, and the time for the leisure and vacation of the bourgeoisie. The words "summer retreat" seem to be a term exclusively for officials and wealthy merchants in our country. They take their beautiful concubines and charming wives, settle in Mogan Mountain and on the coast of Beidaihe, cooling down with ice, spending their days leisurely. Those farmers who are tanned like soy sauce ducks by the scorching sun, the brothers sweating in factories, and the soldiers fighting hard on the battlefield filled with gunfire, they have never even dreamed that there is another cool world in this hot summer.</p>
<p>In Japan, the situation is somewhat different. They are extremely egalitarian about beach vacations. Perhaps it can be said that summer retreats for the Japanese are a transformation of tightened living during the summer. Because areas near the sea are usually desolate, with a lower population density, and the cost of living is one-third cheaper than in the cities. Therefore, most of the city dwellers who have the possibility of moving spend two or three months on the coast during this long summer. On the one hand, they can exercise their body and mind through sea bathing, and on the other hand, they can reduce living expenses. Japanese families are the simplest. Their furnishings do not include heavy furniture such as tables, benches, wardrobes, and beds. So, when traveling, they can leave at any time. It is not difficult to take two or three boxes with them. When the autumn is cool and the wild geese return, they move back to the city. This back-and-forth movement has become a common habit for most people.</p>
<p>Those who cannot travel far due to their duties, aren't they too annoyed and overworked? For this reason, the social departments of major companies spend thousands of dollars to select scenic areas and establish summer cool-down gatherings for the entertainment of the general public. The streets are plastered with colorful advertisements with artistic colors. They are sincerely welcoming tourists. These organizations are purely voluntary in nature. Tourists who participate do not need to spend a penny.</p>
<p>The most wonderful summer cool-down gatherings this year are undoubtedly those of the Ueno Matsuzakaya. They have come up with a unique idea of turning the entire rooftop garden into a winter scene. The surroundings of the garden are equipped with animated scenery. The light gray sky is falling with goose-feather-sized snowflakes. The water in the small pond is frozen into thick ice. There are lions made of snow, and nude models of beautiful women sculpted from snow. Looking around, one sees jade towers and pavilions, all white. The little birds are chirping on the branches, playing the game of pecking snow. Young women, dressed in winter costumes, sing and dance in the nature covered with white velvet carpets, braving the cold and treading on the snow. Everything is decorated realistically, as if winter has really arrived. The garden has movies, dramas, dancing, and comical talks, and you can enter at will without admission tickets. In addition to Matsuzakaya, Sumida Park, Hibiya Park, Shiba Park, and Ryogoku Kokugikan also have summer cool-down gatherings. Either countless boats are prepared, allowing tourists to sway in the green waves, or Chaplin's comedies and the masterpieces of passionate girl Clara Bow are shown. Every evening when the sun sets, all places are crowded with tourists. Violinists play majestic and sorrowful music, and comedians win infinite laughter. Wonderful dances and light songs last until the night is quiet, and then they go home with satisfaction. It's just that those of us who are guests in Japan, looking at the joy of others, looking back at the displaced compatriots in our motherland, always feel that the sad people have different feelings in their hearts, which is extremely sad to say.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Records of What I Saw and Heard in the Old Capital <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuan</p>
<p>Xiya</p>
<p>Nalan Rongruo's Luting Miscellaneous Records states that Li Wenzheng of the Ming Dynasty was granted a residence west of Xichang'anmen, commonly known as Li Gelao Alley. His villa was north of Bei'anmen. Bei'anmen is Diani'anmen, commonly known as the Back Gate. Outside the gate is Shichahai. From here, the Dan Tuo stretches to Jishuitan, where the Yuquan spring water enters the city and accumulates. During the heyday of the Yuan Dynasty, this water was west of the city. The southward-bound cargo ships entered the city through the Tonghui River and gathered in this pool. The tooth walls and brocade cables were crowded and bustling, almost like the story of Emperor Xuanzong's "Song of Obtaining Treasures." During the Ming Dynasty, the city walls were reduced, and cargo ships started warehouses in the east of the city. This place became smoky water, so that a corner of the imperial city could inspire the thought of thousands of miles of rivers and lakes. It is fitting that Wenzheng lingered here, creating a famous site. Wenzheng's Huai Lu Tang Ji has twelve poems of Xiya, Xiya is behind Ci'ensi Temple, and Duke Li took it as his title. This was Duke Li's ancestral home, not a villa. Rongruo made a mistake. The twelve poems are: 1. Hai Zi, 2. West Mountain, 3. Ci'ensi Temple, 4. Xiang Gate, 5. Drinking Horse Pond, 6. Yangliu Bay, 7. Bell and Drum Tower, 8. Ju Gao Pavilion, 9. Rice Field, 10. Peng Pond, 11. Vegetable Garden, 12. Guangfu Temple. They are all scenes from Jishuitan to Shichahai. During the Jiaqing era, Fa Wumen revisited the former residence of Xiya and asked Luo Liangfeng to paint a sequel to the Twelve Pictures of Xiya. For a time, famous people wrote poems and praises, and my uncle Huang Zaitong once copied a copy by hand. During the winter vacation of the Renyin year, I borrowed it from his house and copied several paintings. Huang's poem says, "Xiya was originally the Yuan Xihai, (Jishuitan printed Yuan Xihai Zi.) Wonderful paintings and clear chants several times each. (Xiya made a painting starting with Shen Shitian Wenhengshan. Wumen shikan has more than fifty paintings, and I have seen more than ten paintings. Many elders in the Jiaqing era wrote poems.) Laymen's shrines still have residences, and the Prime Minister's land originally lacked pavilions. (Xiya is Li Wenzheng's ancestral property. There was no villa at first. Therefore, Duke Li's poem has a sentence saying "The green field has no hall, but I am thinking of installing it." For details, see Wumen's Examination of Xiya.) The mountain color of the previous dynasty is still on the city, and the elegant style is gone to the edge of the water. Pine trees and quinoa light gradually become familiar, and flowers are scheduled to come together every time. I followed up with a poem: "The peaceful leisure people are like the meeting, the paintings are traced and copied, and the first is returned. Looking south, I like to sing Huai Lu Ji, and the east wind has lost the national flower platform. In the misty alleys and deserted smoke, the desolate gardens and forests are on the edge of the wild water. I am afraid that few people will come to read the epitaph on the suburban tomb of the virtuous ancients."</p>
<p>Wenzheng's tomb is in Weiwu Village outside Xizhimen, close to Jile Temple. The temple is famous for its crabapple blossoms and has a National Flower Terrace. Although the terrace is still there, the trees are desolate, and the name of the village has also been changed. During the spring of Guihai, I rode a donkey with Fang Yushan to visit. After asking around, I finally found the place. Therefore, there is a couplet at the end of this poem. Today, the Jishuitan area is empty and bright, with gulls, reeds, and the elegance of a marsh. The houses near the water often hear the sound of fulling blocks, especially separated from the times. The reclusive scholars of the old capital love to build huts here. Xu Su Yi of Wuxi built a house here, piling up stones by the stream and moving bamboo to become a barrier. Late in the summer, friends gathered, and the meaning was far away. I once used a sentence to describe the scene, "The willow trees are shaded with endless green, and the rain makes the distant mountains constantly blue." It is not as good as Song Muzhong's poem about passing the old residence on Yinding Bridge, which is especially skillful. Song's poem says, "The Drum Tower is connected to the back lake bay to the west, and the Yinding Bridge is horizontal between the sunsets. The endless blue waves are connected to Taiye, and the sunny green is still sent to the distant mountains. The pine and pagoda trees are still in the old courtyard, and the fairy music is leisurely over the years. The white-haired alchemist has been talking about tea for a long time, and the spring breeze is cold, and the crows are still returning."</p>
<p>From Jishuitan south to Shichahai, there are several acres of rice fields. In the city, this scene is especially strange. The Ju Gao is squeaking, just like in Jiangnan. A long embankment is covered with official willow trees. On both sides of the bank, there are reed sheds and ice carriers, bustling for a distance of about a mile. The Manchu men and women, with heavy makeup and flamboyant clothes, play among them. In recent years, the customs of the old capital have gradually changed. Only here can we still see the remnants of the Spring Bright Dream. On the north bank, there is a restaurant called Huixiantang, which is also purely old-fashioned. Overlooking the railing, the whole view is in sight. Holding a glass of wine, I think as if I am a person after the Southern Crossing thinking of the prosperity of Bianjing.</p>
<p>Jiang Hongjiao's novel "Husband's Wife" is suspended for one day.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Love Song Exchanges <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— By Man Yin</p>
<p>Published by the Folklore Society, compiled by Qiu Jun</p>
<p>(In the minds of ordinary people, it is believed that only scholars with bellies full of ink can produce good literature. However, in my opinion, that is not entirely true. No matter how much ink they have drunk or how accomplished they are, there are things in their works that cannot be considered literature. Conversely, no matter how uncultured some people may be, they can still produce good literary works... ) This is what was said in an article introducing (Further Selections of White Snow Tunes) published in this journal last year. We certainly agree that it is correct. Originally, so-called literary works are produced by gradually refining and transforming genuine emotional folk songs and slang. We can compare the genuine and moving aspects of a work to a beautiful woman, and beautiful words and phrases to fine clothing. A beautiful woman is naturally even more beautiful in fine clothing, but not everyone in fine clothing is a beautiful woman. Similarly, neat formatting and ornate language do not necessarily make a good work. As long as genuine emotions are expressed and the meaning is sincere, even vulgar slang can be considered first-rate literature. Just look at the collections of folk love songs published in various countries around the world that have been passed down through the ages. The most notable example is the Book of Songs in our Five Classics, which is nothing more than folk songs and slang from the Zhou Dynasty. Confucius and other masters not only did not dismiss it, but instead worked hard to organize it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we really have no reason not to recognize folk love songs as literary works and not engage in research and exploration. Recently, to relieve the tedium of the long summer days, I borrowed a pile of folk literature books from the library and from friends, giving me the opportunity to appreciate the truth, beauty, and goodness of folk literature and fulfill my long-cherished wish. This is a very worthwhile and gratifying thing for me. After enjoying them, in addition to paying tribute to the editors of this series, I have specifically selected this book (Love Song Exchanges) to introduce to the readers of this journal for general appreciation.</p>
<p>This is a special collection of love songs exchanged between men and women in rural villages. At any time, in the mountains and fields, there are always many farmers who, when tired from work or during their leisure time, cannot help but sing mountain songs that leisurely linger and attract the opposite sex. This book contains these lyrics.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into three volumes. The first volume (Nanyang Journey) (The story concerns men from Lingnan who are going to Nanyang. As they prepare to leave their homes and cross the ocean, the women feel sad. Thus, during their farewells, they each express their pain, and their sincere words become lyrics...) is divided into three sections with a total of one hundred songs. The second volume is a collection of common love songs exchanged between men and women, divided into sections such as "Expressing Feelings," "Her Ideal Lover," "Separation and Reunion," "Affectionate Words," "Words of Farewell," "The Amazing Same Name," "Questions," and "Jokes," with a total of one hundred songs. The third volume is also a collection of common love songs exchanged between men and women, divided into more than twenty sections such as "Hard to Part," "Eighteen Answers," "Love and Money," "Exclusive Love and Multiple Loves," "Old Man and Young Woman," "Scholar's Farewell to His Wife," "Searching Thousands of Miles for Unmarried Grandchildren," "A Glimpse of the Han River," "Keeping Secrets," "Exposure of Spring Light," "Questions," "Communication," "Gifts," "Marks of Marriage," "Love and Pain," "Following Footprints," "Farewell," and "Teasing," with a total of one hundred songs. Some of them have explanations in front, and there are national language annotations for those song phrases that are not easily understood by scholars. It not only preserves the original appearance of the folk songs, but also makes it clear at a glance. We cannot help but appreciate and praise the editor's hard work.</p>
<p>Since the entire volume consists of folk songs and, moreover, love songs, it is naturally inevitable that there will be vulgarity, or even obscenity. However, it is a genuine expression of emotion and a sincere attitude, and it can be asserted that they have no choice but to sing them. This alone, as mentioned earlier, is enough to qualify them as good literary works. Moreover, there are many phrases that are sonorous, meaningful, and use appropriate metaphors.</p>
<p>In addition, folk love songs contain a lot of valuable data for the study of history, language, anthropology, sociology... such as local customs, habits, and the psychology of the people. For example, in the second volume of this book ("Her Ideal Lover"), we can learn that rural women do not welcome scholars as their (black lacquered benches), but welcome rough farmers, which is exactly the opposite of the modern women who hope their lovers are doctors and masters. The reason is:</p>
<p>Do not marry a scholar,</p>
<p>Who leaves you alone all year round.</p>
<p>Better to marry a farmer,</p>
<p>With whom you can discuss things intimately.</p>
<p>Because they cannot resist the suffering of sexual frustration, they think of resolving it. There are also women who have tried to transgress moral principles, break the law, and disregard reputation and life and death, truly sacrificing themselves for love. For example, the heroines in the fifth part of the first volume ("Wife Big Husband Small") and the third volume ("Exposure of Spring Light") sing about this kind of situation.</p>
<p>There are also triangular love stories, such as the one in the third volume ("Exclusive Love and Change"). However, here he or she is very frankly telling the new lover in front of the old lover. Their attitude of loyalty, honesty, and lack of hypocrisy is much more admirable than the sneaky and secretive behavior of young people today.</p>
<p>In short, in addition to the value of the lyrics for appreciation, this book also gives us a lot of information about the social situation in areas such as Pingyuan, Guangdong. Recently, our nationalistic literature and art has occupied the entire Chinese literary world. The so-called nationalism is to promote the inherent lively, brave, and striving spirit of the Chinese nation, resist imperialism, and revitalize the national consciousness. Then, undoubtedly, we really need to pay attention to folk literature like this book, which vividly depicts the national character. This article concludes on this point and introduces this book to the public.</p>

<p>— By A'mei</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Standing at the entrance of the Mengyuan Hotel, watching Wanfen's figure disappear around the corner of Zhejiang Road, he thought that things were going too smoothly.</p>
<p>An hour ago, Wanfen gave him an opportunity to feel numb and excited. She said,</p>
<p>"Ah Lin, does that female classmate of yours still often look for you?"</p>
<p>"Why would she often look for me? I'm afraid she'd rather spend her time with her boyfriend."</p>
<p>"Aren't you her boyfriend?" Wanfen's words pierced his heart. Ah Lin blushed.</p>
<p>"Wanfen," Ah Lin took her hand, "Why do you say such things too? Don't you know my heart?"</p>
<p>"Hmph, you're too serious. Can't you tell I'm joking?"</p>
<p>"Wanfen, this only proves how deeply you love me. The meaning of your so-called joke contains the courage to protect me."</p>
<p>"The person I love most in the world is you, think about it, Ah Lin. If you ran away from me, my life would be over. How could I not watch over you all the time?"</p>
<p>Moved to the point of embracing this woman and giving her a long kiss was not enough to express his gratitude, Ah Lin shed tears.</p>
<p>"Ah Lin, has your money not been wired yet?"</p>
<p>"Oh, damn, I forgot all about it. Here, take it."</p>
<p>The woman took the money and said,</p>
<p>"How about we go to the Mingyuan tonight for some fun?"</p>
<p>Slightly hesitant, Wanfen understood what he meant.</p>
<p>"If you don't have time today, tomorrow at the Yuegong would be fine too."</p>
<p>"Eleven o'clock then, you wait for me. Really, I've been wanting to dance these past few days."</p>
<p>Reluctantly, they said goodbye.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>"I thought you went out. You're too late. Is there any mail from home?"</p>
<p>Yizhen opened the door and blurted out.</p>
<p>"Hey, the people at home are really hopeless. I really wonder why parents can't understand their children's hearts. They said they absolutely cannot dissolve the engagement."</p>
<p>"Then how are you going to resolve it?"</p>
<p>"I'll break off relations with my family."</p>
<p>"But there's a financial problem. Even if you don't study anymore, finding a job won't be easy."</p>
<p>Ah Lin didn't answer. The woman continued, "What about the two books you promised me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry, but it's also because my family hasn't sent any money."</p>
<p>Ah Lin was very surprised, but the woman had already picked up the handkerchief from the table. The two words "Wanfen" embroidered on the corner of the handkerchief made Yizhen understand her lover's recent behavior. She didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"I was going to give it to you," Ah Lin said.</p>
<p>"Then forgive me for not thanking you."</p>
<p>After the woman said this, she wanted to leave. The man was perfunctorily trying to keep her.</p>
<p>"You're just nagging, do you think me staying here with you means I love you?"</p>
<p>"Then, goodbye."</p>
<p>"Goodbye."</p>
<p>Yizhen left. Ah Lin celebrated his own skill in handling things.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The streets were crowded and noisy. Streetcars rolled on the asphalt roads. The red and green lights of the shops seemed to smile at everyone. Graceful women pressed onto the sidewalks, captivating the souls of ambitious men.</p>
<p>With a cigar in his mouth, no one could say that this young man wasn't happy. The rickshaw stopped on the side of North Sichuan Road. Ah Lin walked into the Yuegong.</p>
<p>In the dim light, he couldn't find Wanfen. The dance floor was filled with five-colored flesh. People were intoxicated. Dance, dance, dance until they were tired. He vaguely saw a woman who looked like Wanfen walking towards him. He went to the back and indeed knew it was Wanfen. He stood up, his anxiety completely gone at this time, preparing to greet the woman with a welcoming expression. He called out,</p>
<p>"Wanfen!"</p>
<p>But Wanfen ignored him, glanced at him proudly, and threw herself into a man's arms and sat down.</p>
<p>How should he resolve this awkward situation? A man's self-esteem made Ah Lin feel that arguing with that woman now would be no different from inviting humiliation. He only thought about how he had wronged Yizhen.</p>
<p>Thinking in the gentle night breeze, the contented people walking under the streetlights no longer included Ah Lin.</p>

<p>Two letters were on the desk. He knew that the letter from home was urging him to get married, and Yizhen's letter was undoubtedly asking him to join some research society.</p>
<p>But after reading the letters, he fainted on the bed. Everything was over. His family said that since he was able to choose his own marriage, he should naturally be able to support a woman, so they could no longer send him money. But why were Yizhen's words so firm? She said,</p>
<p>"... A love with cracks, let it break. Ah Lin, I have already decided to dedicate my heart to someone else..."</p>
<p>Crying and laughing were useless. The situation was beyond remedy in every aspect. Only the shadow of the word "lessons" danced before Ah Lin's eyes.</p>

<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>I congratulated General Pershing. On September 13, 14, and 15, our troops tightly defended the new positions recaptured from the enemy.</p>
<p>The American First Army must now transfer most of its troops to the west of the Meuse River to show its great strength.</p>
<p>Having previously decided on September 2 that the American army would attack Saint-Mihiel on September 3, I now order the three commanders-in-chief of the British, French, and American armies to advance towards the Cambrai-Saint-Quentin-Mézières line. The German transverse railway is within reach. The American army will launch a fierce attack west of the Meuse River.</p>
<p>The Allied offensive from the Seille River to the Aisne River is now developing smoothly. The enemy army began a full retreat. All Allied forces were then divided and brought together to attack, and the offensive routes are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The British army, with the French army covering its left flank, will continue to advance towards Cambrai and Saint-Quentin.</p>
<p>(2) The central units of the French army will drive the enemy back across the Aisne River and the Ailette River.</p>
<p>(3) The American army (A) will operate in the Woëvre area, with the goal of clearing the Paris-Avricourt railway line and obtaining a base of operations for the next attack. This battle must take place no later than September 10 to prevent the enemy from taking the opportunity to replenish its strength. (B) On the east side, with the Meuse River covering its left flank and with the French Fourth Army supporting it, it will launch a fierce attack towards Mézières. This battle must take place no later than between September 20 and 25. The first goal is to fight on both sides of the Argonne Forest and defeat the enemy to the Stenay-Lessives-Attigny line. The second goal is to occupy Mézières and advance eastward to take the Aisne River.</p>
<p>I do not give up my plan for the British army to directly attack the Hindenburg Line. On September 8, I wrote to Field Marshal Haig, asking him to (immediately begin preparations to conquer this defense line, and to advance beyond this line to the designated destination. If you want to attack the enemy by surprise, then this attack should not be delayed).</p>
<p>The next day, September 9, I went to La Panne to meet with King Albert of Belgium, and explained to him that now that the German army is wavering and its forces are mostly concentrated in France, our army can take the opportunity to drive back the enemy forces in Belgium and recover the lost territories north of the Yser River. We then further discussed the battle plan, instructing the British and French armies to cover the Belgian army's attack.</p>
<p>King Albert of Belgium fully agreed with this. I then went to Cassel to meet with Field Marshal Haig, General Dellemer, and Major General Gillain to discuss in detail and immediately draft a battle plan.</p>
<p>The first step is to prepare a base of operations for the offensive, with the goal of occupying the Kemmelberg ridge, the Holset Forest, the Bainghemberg ridge, Scherpenheuvel, the Vloka Ridge, Langemark, Woumen, and the Comines Canal. The second step is to actively advance towards Bruges to clear the Belgian coast, and to attack towards Tielt and Ghent. The first battle will be fought by nine divisions of the Belgian army and two divisions of the British army. The second battle will be fought by most of the Belgian army, along with the British Second Army and three divisions of French infantry and three divisions of French cavalry.</p>
<p>After the meeting, I immediately issued a cover letter to the armies designated to participate in the operation, specifying the resolutions.</p>
<p>Commander-in-chief Pétain naturally did not remain uninformed of these plans, and I also notified him that, if necessary, I would like to appoint General Degoutte to take command.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 11, King Albert visited Panne, and I immediately asked him to command the Belgian army, and also designated the British and French forces participating in the operation to be under his command. He fully agreed, but requested that a formal military order be issued and that a French general be assigned as an assistant. General Degoutte was then appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Allied Army of Flanders, under the command of King Albert. Major General Gillain, Field Marshal Haig, and Commander-in-chief Pétain all received notification, but were firmly instructed to maintain strict secrecy on all aspects.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Haig fully agreed with my plan. On the 14th, he replied to my letter of September 8, stating that he was preparing to launch a fierce attack between Ypres and Comines in order to occupy the enemy defenses west of the Saint-Quentin Canal and the Scheldt River, and to allow the British Fourth Army to reach the position to attack the Hindenburg Line.</p>
<p>I ordered General Débeney to assist the right wing of the British Fourth Army with the left wing of the French First Army. This was his main and fixed operational task for the future. The military order stated, (Thereafter, the left wing of the French army must always cover the right wing of the British Fourth Army, and must always maintain contact between the two armies...).</p>
<p>On September 18, the British Fourth Army, with the protection of the left wing of the French First Army and the right wing of the British Third Army, successfully attacked the Holnon-Feuillaucourt-Hargicourt-Lempire-Épehy line. All designated goals were achieved. Over ten thousand prisoners were captured and one hundred and fifty cannons were seized. An especially important achievement was that our army had now advanced to the position to attack the Hindenburg Line. Furthermore, because Field Marshal Haig was preparing to direct the main attack on the Hindenburg Line from Saint-Quentin to Cambrai, the results of this battle were particularly important.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Haig immediately made arrangements with this goal in mind. On September 22, he ordered the British First, Third, and Fourth Armies to prepare for a general attack on the Hindenburg Line. Although he had not yet notified his subordinates of the date of the general attack, he had already decided in his heart to begin around the 25th.</p>
<p>The British Commander-in-Chief notified Commander-in-Chief Pétain of his plan and requested immediate reinforcements for the French First Army, especially in terms of artillery. Commander-in-Chief Pétain then drew reinforcements from the center of the Reserve Army Corps (because this route was not temporarily prepared for any important battles). The progress made in the past two months had shortened the Reserve Army Corps' battle line considerably, making it easy for Commander-in-Chief Pétain to draw reinforcements (To be continued).</p>
