<h3>德奥税約之影響</h3>
<p>德奥税約發表後至今各國之態度所可知者捷克與法反對最甚其他各國即有反對之舉動大抵如羅馬尼亞之聲明祇使此項協定不致抵觸現行條約而已此外當亦别無可以表示也更進一步言之捷克與法之提出抗議充其意亦爲恐德奥二國由此協定進而爲其他之結合故爲預防計使此税約不至有其他之進行當亦不至干涉之而使此約破除也此皆就各國應有之地位以備他日之立塲而已</p>
<p>至於國際聯盟會之各方面據日内瓦電謂對於德奥關税協定極表歡迎認爲歐洲經濟安固進行中之基石國聯會員又信德奥關税協定與國際聯盟會之約章及其他諸約並無抵觸之處是大多數國家之觀念咸不以此德奥關税協約爲非則其情勢什九可以成功且更推仿於其他各國尤意中事也</p>

<p>國民社二十三日柏林電　德奥關税草約全文、定今晚公佈、預料各國首都關於此事之爭論、亦將有重大之新激動、就目下所知、該協定係載明德奥兩國訂立關税聯盟之原則、保存兩國之自立、并尊重對於其他諸國之義務、法外長白里安前爲補救歐洲經濟狀况起見、曾贊成各國局部締結協約、而此德奥新約、即依據該意旨而行者也、兩國今欲統一關税制、並求商業政策之協調、同時兩國間之商業除火柴·烟·啤洒等專賣品外、其他諸物一槪免税、但兩國之税關仍依舊分立存在、所徵得之税收分配於兩國、且兩國仍有與他國締結商約之權、惟須在可能範圍之内共同聯合進行耳、草約中並規定將來正式條約締結之後、有效期定爲五年、再兩國各得與第三國協商加入該項關税同盟、</p>

<p>晨初即開低盤　自早晨五月開盤即降二兩三錢、爲七百零二兩大條雖無變更、市况則平、且私電已升八分之一、嗣後略有一兩餘上落、計一兩半至三兩、復以源成·恒興元·志豐永·萬興等售出甚勁、一落七八兩、僅爲六百九十五兩五錢、未幾時元亨·福昌·大德成等買進、並由麥行·台灣買進六月英金一三九三七五、故先令揭佈時爲六百九十九兩半、惟掛價勿更、略遜一兩半、旋由恒興·福昌又進、益以英金見佳、匯豐吃進六月八七五、三井進七月八一二五、至十點時漲爲七百零四兩、倏忽間復露萎弱之狀、大户恒興元·成豐永·大德成·源成等前來售出、加之英金轉鬆、六月份銀行互做八七五、又日商銀行買去九三七五、乃金價一瀉七兩餘、十一點零爲九十六兩五錢、物品等略進即加至九十九兩、復由乾昌祥餘大等賣出、不易支持、茲已激跌七兩、十一點三刻爲九十二兩入後略拉上二兩餘、計九十四兩五錢、午刻收市九十三兩八錢、重又抑至九十二兩、揭價爲七百五十七兩八錢、計撳六十三四兩、</p>
<p>後市每况愈下　後市開盤八十九兩、乃午收後之餘風、且由順利萬興等賣出也、至後萃昌仁·順利·萬興等復買進、遂漲爲九十四兩、滙票則平、三井吸大連　兩五錢二分、俄而大户出售、且因英金以一四　賣、故二點半爲九十一兩、繼有二兩餘起仆、至三點一刻傳聞日商銀行吸收現金之説、遂漲爲九十三兩五錢三點半因泰興·成豐承·恒興元·鴻興·福餘等傾售、尤以英金更覺寛折、銀行買價一四一二五、至後一八七五尙難脱手、於是市氣疲頽、大有一瀉千里之槪猛跌十二三兩有奇、惟其間計有二三兩盤頭、迨四點三十分最小價收盤計六百八十一兩、續又貶去二兩卒爲七十九兩天豐永等頗有出售、比諸上日計回落二十三兩三錢、（照掛牌而言）乃迭漲二天之反向也、查終日最大價七百○四兩最小價六百八十一兩、計有二十三兩曲折、物品早市○一兩半、午收九十三兩半、下午八十九兩半、收市七十九兩半、揭價計撳七十七八兩、登賑上午三月八十七兩、四月九十兩、五月九十四兩十午三月八十一兩、四月八十四兩、五月八十八兩補水八十七兩下午八十一兩、殆四月一日起下午登賑至四點三十分收市、</p>
<p>市塲供過於求　核計各號交易、計元亨·福昌·恒興·生大·同太昌·萬興·順利等均占買方、元茂永·大德成·志豐永·源太·福太亨·乾昌祥等乍出乍進、爲數甚巨、恒興元、元大永及投機家吳某等均出、萃昌永出而又進、下午成豐永·鴻興恒興元·天豐永·宏利·乾昌祥·太興·源成及陸某等均出、萬興·永順利·源太·餘大出人不等、萃昌永初入後出、恒興福昌則進、廣帮共追進一千數百條係套做滙票、大連帮前市共進七八百條、出三百餘條、後市共計三千多條、大都扯平</p>
<h3>外匯初平繼絀</h3>
<p>昨英美銀市均無變動、惟匯卒見升、至匯豐掛牌各匯亦均不更　然銀行内盤初平後成迴旋之勢、復以金市下遊、遂亦萎疲、下午尤疲、乃金價暴跌二十餘兩、已破進六百八十兩關口、實因六　　售、迨結果各匯比諸上日、計英金重已超出一先令四便士之外、計長三一二五、美金長六二五、日金跌去三分半、華商金業中大致抛出面套條子、計英金成交三十餘萬鎊、銀行如麥行·臺灣·浙江·匯豐·三井·住友·華比·等均有吸進、惟價愈趨愈鬆　又正金臺灣上海稍有售出又各行互做者約計數萬鎊、至美金略亦對做、而華商出人有限　殆大連　由大連帮售出一百餘萬元、三井華比買胃不薄至於匯市之疲實受標金之激剌也、</p>
<p>英匯　内盤計有三一二五差額、上午三四月出價一先令三便士七五、五六月八一二五、買價照加○六二五、　比　行互做六月八七五、麥行售九三七五、九點半後臺灣美豐進九三七五、浙江和豐進本月八七五、　豐進六月八七五、三井買七月八一二五故金市復出七百兩、以後正金臺灣出五六月八一二五、（生大進）荷　華比互做八七五、住友臺灣三井麥行買五六七月同爲九三七五、午收出價八七五至九三七五、下午華比華義對做四月三菱匯豐對做六月固爲四便士、上海出現九三七五、麥行住友買五六月四便士、又孟買來電購進七月固價、係住友出、滙豐進四月○六二五又三月同價、華比進五月一二五、四點後住友進一二五、大　恒出、收市三四月出價○六二五、五六月一二五、進價照加○六二五、</p>

<h3>銀市忽轉沉寂</h3>
<p>昨據倫敦電訉、大條銀近遠期均無伸縮、同爲十三便士五六二五、脚地無特殊變化交易稀少、市况平靜、收市後市在沉寂、美國觀望双接紐約電訉、美銀價亦無上落、仍計二角九分二五、英對美加上零六二五、美對英勿更、同爲四元八角六分、日美仍爲四十九元三七五、日英仍計二先令○四三七五、英滬先令短去一二五、爲一先令四辨士一二五、孟買現貨回升二安那、計四十四羅比○五安那、又本日上午路透電通等仍無升降云、</p>
<h3>撲朔迷離之銀洋市况</h3>
<p>近日銀洋兩種市價撲朔迷離、莫可捉摸、良以需要不般、即有稍稍進展、終以暫而不久、是故銷胃稍般則價挺、滯則仍落、結果乍上乍落、軒　輒微、據業中之推測、本月内似無發展希望、大槪出月（四月中）進出口稍有發動、則銀洋欵項用途、或有一度增色耳、</p>
<p>厘拆價昨均低隨（洋厘）早市爲七錢二分四厘二毫半、午市爲七錢二分四厘較諸前日市價計小二毫半、交易尤爲稀少、故人心殊覺怠懈、（銀拆）早午兩市均開三分、較前日早市頓小一半、劃頭加水如舊、仍有三四五分之譜、（輔幣）早午市江南小洋同爲六錢三分七厘、交易兩市俱無、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢三分○二毫半、午市爲六錢三分○半厘、亦與前日兩市相同、做出早市十一萬角、午市五萬角、銅元勿動、仍爲三百六十九千文、</p>
<p>銀洋交易與收解　（銀欵）昨日銀行方面收解消息、計華商收解票欵一百八十餘萬、外商收解票欵一百七八十萬、各種貨滙税　諸欵九百餘萬、特出欵項數十萬、進倉五十萬、出倉七十萬、日商銀行收解各欵四百二十餘萬、出倉三十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千五百餘萬、劃頭欵收解四百十餘萬各路滙欵收解一百二十餘萬、收現數十萬、（洋欵）滙劃票欵　早市做出八十九萬、午市五十三萬、鈔票兩市均無交易、塲外鈔票早市十三萬六千、千市五萬五千、銀行買賣、早市互市六十五萬、午市四十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百四十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出二百二三十萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百四十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百六十餘萬、拆借洋欵一百三十餘萬小同行交易七八十萬、</p>
<h3>期現洋消息彙誌</h3>
<p>期洋　今年期洋無人競爭、故目下消息毫無見聞但昨聞金融界業此者談、本屆期洋、雖不逮上年之盛、然總不能完全絶跡、據最近推測預計再逾一二星期中、或者對於專放繭欵及押欵之金融業、當必有所點綴市景照目前情勢而論、期洋價之間做、其軒　終不致超出現厘價一分以上云、</p>
<p>現洋　近來錢莊方面、對客帮需求、曾有大批購裝、駐申各滙票號及金融滙票機關之申莊、類率委托錢莊代購、聞前日作定價格之數量、已達二百萬以上約日内裝出而汕厦及長江帮北路等處、咸有購備之成議果爾則逆料洋厘市價、或有活動之希冀云、</p>

<h3>救濟女子自殺之我見</h3>
<p>— 絜廬</p>
<p>年來男女自殺之慘聞。發見於都市者日衆。揆厥原因。男子以生活問題爲多。女子以戀愛問題爲多。見短情長。誤蹈歧路。天下滔滔良可悲也。昨讀自由談。深服陶令君引蒙莊之言以解嘲。蒙莊之言曰。大塊載我以形。勞我以生。佚我以老息我以死。善吾生者。乃所以善吾死也。乃避不勞之生。而趨不善之死。是謂非命。天下之言人生觀者。孰有徹底若莊生者乎佛之言曰。了生死。曰大解脱。今若戰敗在衣食之間。陶醉乎戀愛之中。縱横刀一笑。白綾數尺。豈得所謂了生死大解脱者乎。茲姑論女子之自殺。在昔女子。非欲保一家之忠貞。即欲完一己之節操。遂有自殺之事。今乃往往自殺於失節之後。此不同者一。三十年前之女子。抱嫁鷄隨鷄之主義三家村裏。亦不少美滿之家庭。不幸寡鵠自守。則長齊繡佛。爲其一生之生活而已二十年來。世風漸變。不幸女子。往往以辦學而消磨其無憀之歲月。自殺之事。猶未聞也。此不同者二。民七執教鞭於甬上某女校。同事汪女士。率一子一女自杭來。品學俱優。學生皆親之若保母。汪亦愛學生若子女。微聞女士身世頗凄凉。所天亦宦家子。狹斜徵逐無虚日。視女士若陌路。久而生活且感困難。以某公介乃挈子女來甬訓蒙以餬口。故眉黛時蘊泪痕也。後主校事者。納讒者言。謂學校經費支絀。以一教師。供膳三口。毋乃不資暑假後。托故辭去。小學生何知。突聞此耗。有對之唏噓不　者有號啕大哭者。女士皆苦笑慰之而散。翌日。學生發起一歡送會。愚在座。聞女士答詞。婉而得體。頗有大家風範。末要求學生合送一物。方揣測間。女士從容言曰。其物非它。即希望諸位小妹妹小弟弟送我一副輓聯而已。一時室中號啕之聲又起。愚不忍聞。離座遂出。此十四年前事也。兒童號啕之聲。猶在耳邊不知汪女士猶在人世否。若以今人之輕於自殺則女士之可死者已非一次。莊生所謂勞我以生女士洵可謂勞止也已。嗟夫。新潮洶湧。禮防潰决。如此自殺。死胡足卹。雖然今日之爲父母者。幸勿仍架舊日之老花眼鏡也斯可矣。</p>
<h3>抱犢崮考</h3>
<p>— 穎川秋水</p>
<p>山之以抱犢稱者有四。一在河南盧氏縣東南。二在山西壺關縣東南。三在今河北獲鹿縣西。四即在山東嶧縣之北。又名抱犢　者也。除盧氏之抱犢山。無所異聞外。壺關之所犢山。有稽康入石室覓素書故事。獲鹿之抱犢山。有石刻抱犢福地四字古蹟。而山東嶧縣之抱犢山。則又名君山。據元和郡縣志。謂是山壁立千仭。頂寛有水。（其水名西泇東南流入江蘇邳縣與東泇合又南流入運河）舊有隠者抱一犢於其上墾種。故以爲名。而抱朴子亦謂其上出芝草。觀此。則所謂抱犢崮者。雖非若洞天仙境。諒亦不失爲沃土良田。而今乃淪爲匪窟。此政府所以有在該處設縣之意乎</p>
<h3>首都國醫國虊界會議紀聞</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>醫藥之道。但求適於病者之身心。而使疾苦得以早日痊瘳者。本不必問其爲中醫西醫中藥西藥也。迺者。國人凡百事物。崇尙歐西。即治病服藥。泰半亦皆延西醫。配藥水。以示新穎。而深信其治療之神速。幾置國醫國藥於不顧。致引起中西醫藥界之爭端。且有一般市民。更欲倡言廢止中醫。廢除中藥之談論。故中華醫藥兩業。益形憤懣而恐慌。雖然。西醫西藥率皆依據科學方法從事。特吾國之醫藥。以數千年久遠之歷史。垂迄於今。亦自有深邃之學術和經騐。不容泯滅廢棄者也。茲國府有鑒於斯。特召集全國各省市國醫國藥兩界之代表。於十三日至十七日。在首都中央國術館。開全國醫藥界研究會之籌備會議。到全國各省市代表達三百人。國民政府行政院立法院。均派代表蒞會演説。對於國醫國藥。均主張保留。以存國粹。且深望國内醫藥界。嗣後當更深切研究醫理和藥物。對於治病發藥。務宜審愼將事。則著手成春。自能恢復病家樂就國醫樂用國藥之觀念。可謂勗勉備至。嗣各代表提出關於研究醫藥上之提案五十餘件。交付討論。並先議决成立衛生組研究組等七部。藉以促成大會早日成立。爲全國民衆謀幸幅。亦爲國醫國藥界爭光榮也。此次各代表在京。由中央國術館。中央國醫館。南京國醫公會。南京國藥公會等團體。分日設筵欵待。而各代表於臨别之際。亦復設席答禮。賓主盡歡。頗極一時之盛云。</p>
<h3>説鼠</h3>
<p>— 儉父</p>
<p>鼠之爲物於人害多而益少。然以居十二屬之首。職是之故。而鼠遂爲人世不可缺之物矣。古人用意深遠。往往將鼠比人。如譏人貌寢曰鼠目。譏人依阿曰首鼠。譏人營私曰鼠竊。譏人逃匿曰鼠竄。此爲人所共知者。晏子春秋。景公問晏子曰。治國何患。對曰。社鼠者。不可薫。不可灌君之左右。出賣寒熱。入則比周。此之謂社鼠也。史記。李斯少時爲鄉中吏。見吏厠中。鼠食不潔。人犬數驚之。入倉。見鼠食積粟。居大廡。而無人犬之憂。乃歏曰。人賢不肖如鼠。在所自處耳。亦以鼠喻人者。惟余以譏人營私曰鼠竊。譏人逃避曰鼠竄。此兩寓尤爲精切。蓋鼠之所工爲竊。而所恃爲竄也。試舉一例。以資證明。余平素喜服雞卵。某日。購生雞卵五枚。瀕臥時。散置於案之裏側。翌晨取服。竟失所在。蓋已不脛而走矣。竊怪之。因更購數枚。置原處以硯其異。食頃。見有鼠十餘頭。麆集案上。一鼠用四足合抱一卵。仰臥案上。厥狀如蝟。另由一鼠緊嚙其尾。銜之下墜餘鼠遞次銜尾。魚貫而下。及達地上。遂倒曳入穴而去。如是者數次余掩其不備。直前扑之。斃一鼠。餘悉逃竄。因悟昨夜之五卵。乃膏鼠腹矣。夫鼠之竊術。如是其工。豈非出人意料哉。然則世之達官貴人。其師鼠竊之故智者。幾何不鼠竄以去也。用作鼠説。以廣其義。</p>
<p>▲短訉　昌明藝術學校。成績　然。聲譽久著。昨余與友人同往參觀。見該校對於國畫尤爲注重。教室中備有八尺許之鏡橱數架。中懸文五峯董華亭八大山人等精品。以爲學生參考。並於學生中見一髮蒼蒼年約五十者。心甚異之。退而詢諸該校教授。知爲靖江縣人劉渭。所畫人物花鳥。頗有根底。本學期始來肄業。好學如此。洵是老泉流亞。亦海上學界之趣聞也。</p>

<h3>樊樊山與蓴客日記</h3>
<p>— 曼因</p>
<p>樊樊山在北平逝世。吾國之舊文學家。又弱一個。前次曾訛傳樊已歸道山。有撰輓聯。爲登報章。厥後乃知爲海外東坡之謠。蓋在一月以前。樊出外訪友。曾在車上跌仆一次。經人扶起。然頭目即有昏瞀之象。或云樊軀體清癯。决非因此而罹中風之症。然老年人最忌傾跌。初不拘於身軀之肥瘠也。樊故世後。有最可惜之一事。則李蓴客日記。（即越縵堂日記）除商務印書館印行之大部分外。尙有八大本。在樊山處。當時影印李蓴客日記時。各人醵資。而張岱杉擔任最多。至一萬元。然此八本。樊山不肯交出。後岱杉向之索取。蔡子民向之索取。彼均漫應之而遲遲不肯交出。據云此八本中。譏評樊山獨多。不但譏評其詩文著作。并譏評其品行。我輩讀越縵堂日記時。初見蓴客與張香濤樊增祥。似均爲好友。厥後因事參商。蓴客遂大駡張香濤。而此八本中。亦并詈及樊山。然同先間之遺聞掌故。頗見消沈。惟蓴客日記中。時見一二。更多議論丰采。爲搜求近世史者所喜讀。故屢次向索。而靳不與人者。或云在樊山生前。已付之一炬矣。曾聞有人勸之曰。縱有訾議及君者。以墨塗乙之可也。試觀越縵堂日記中。亦有不少塗墨之處。顧樊山初不省也。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（四）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十二日。Scmdia　Steamer　Co.　Mchta米他約赴印度商會及大學茶會。見人甚多。一報館人來訪余。談及回教事甚詳。據云回教在印度有六千萬人。其勢甚强。與中國回教亦相聯絡。西亞勢力大可注意也。至英人制印度本取之於回教之手。而印度本境多半已被回教征服也。回教殺牛。印度教敬牛。始相衝突。近自甘地以後。漸互助調和以對外矣。</p>
<p>印度有一大困難者。則語言文字之複雜是也。如錫蘭語。而其讀古佛經又用巴利語。孟加拉省報紙用孟加拉語。孟買省報紙用孟買語。計全印度語言人種不下百種。現行用文字至少亦在二三十種以上。故統一運動甚困難也。今幸英語爲官話。印度人相見均樂用英語。若用印土語。則不通。如粤人遇閩人。亦用英語爲便矣。本來英人韋爾士有預言。將來世界有統一之希望者。爲操英語與華語之民族。因此兩種語言。占民族十萬萬以上。意者將來大同事業。不出韋氏所料。華人大有此資格。而印度語言亦難存在。其文化雖高。如僧加利語。巴利語。今印人自己亦不用。成爲古文。不過如希拉拉丁文耳。友人習印文者。每告余梵文之高尙。然余以爲不過如希拉文可供學者研究耳。余甚苦印人名字。一人名十餘音。即如金剛經之無上菩提四字。梵音九字。太笨矣。據言英國之兵在印度者。約七萬。所雇印度之兵。全印過十萬。余問其餉銀月若干。答十七盧布。特皆普通兵士。官長極少。印度全境大省九。小省若干。直轄於政府。此外尙有藩王數十。舊日土封建之君。名爲拉查。即君也。英屬境内又有法國屬地。如據加城最近地方一小部名Chandarnagar成打那加不過數千人。一小市而已。尙爲法屬。亦怪事也。因以前法本有甚大屬地在印度。經數次戰爭。英取法而代之。尙存此一彈丸之紀念耳。　至印度抗英運動。現全部甚烈。不止甘地一派。余偶檢一日報上載各地擲炸彈者甚多同一日中。掣去國旗者有十七八處之多。可想見矣。</p>

<h3>Beijing Municipal Election Adopts a Mixed Election System</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The election of representatives to the National Assembly in Beijing Municipality, because there are only three seats, has decided to adopt a mixed election system. After the office has formulated the list of voters, it will consult with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to guide and investigate various groups. Regarding professional groups, there are about 80 chambers of commerce and trade associations, about 30 industries, and about 20 agriculture. In addition, there are the party headquarters and branches of various districts, Central University, Jinling University, Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, the Municipal Education Association, and free professional groups, etc. Currently, more than 20 groups have submitted their lists, and the rest are being urged to submit them. The date of the vote will be determined after the list of voters is finalized. As for the division of polling districts, the principles have been stipulated: (1) convenience of access, (2) preventing voters from crowding and disrupting order, (3) no difficulty in allocating management and supervisory personnel, and the number of districts and addresses will be determined based on these principles. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>National Assembly: Number of Mongolian Representatives</h3>
<p>Difficulty in Allocating to Each League</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the election of Mongolian and Tibetan representatives to the National Assembly, the Central Government has formulated separate measures for whether the Mongolian side should use the league and banner as electoral bodies. However, the number of Mongolian representatives is twelve. Because there is no organization of professional groups, allocating them to each league and banner means that each league will have less than one person on average. The various leagues are also unwilling to be biased in this election. Therefore, the election supervisors and voter lists of each league, and the polling addresses, are difficult to determine. The Mongolian and Tibetan Election Office, due to the urgency of the time and the fact that the number of attending representatives cannot be increased, has consulted the opinions of each league and telegraphed the General Office to request a flexible approach, allowing each league to recommend representatives to attend, so that the process can proceed smoothly.

<h3>The Impact of the German-Austrian Customs Treaty</h3>
<p>Since the publication of the German-Austrian Customs Treaty, the attitudes of various countries have been known. The Czech Republic and France are most opposed, and other countries have also taken opposing actions, mostly in the form of Romania's statement that this agreement should not conflict with existing treaties, and there is nothing else that can be expressed. Furthermore, the protests of the Czech Republic and France are mainly out of fear that Germany and Austria will use this agreement to proceed to other combinations, so as a preventive measure, they will not interfere as long as this customs treaty does not have other developments, but they will not break the agreement. This is all to prepare for a future position based on the due position of each country.</p>
<p>As for the various aspects of the League of Nations, according to Geneva telegrams, they are very welcoming to the German-Austrian customs agreement, considering it a cornerstone for the economic stability of Europe. Members of the League of Nations also believe that the German-Austrian customs agreement does not conflict with the League of Nations charter and other agreements. Since the majority of countries do not consider this German-Austrian customs agreement to be wrong, its situation is likely to succeed, and it is even more intended to be imitated by other countries.</p>

<h3>The Communist Bandits Are Renamed Red Bandits</h3>

If the names Communist Party or Communist Bandits are used, it will arouse the curiosity of the general public, which is of great concern to the future of bandit suppression. From now on, all armies across the country should uniformly rename the Communist Bandits as Red Bandits, to promote propaganda and benefit military operations." (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Funding for Shanxi Demobilization is Being Raised</h3>

<h3>Zou Zuohua Talks About the Issue of Opening Gold Mines</h3>

According to him, he has not heard of the opening of gold mines in northern Manchuria. The opening of gold mines in the Xing'an District was requested by him and has been implemented. Shi Yousan requested to lead his troops to the Xing'an Mountains for reclamation, but he did not agree because there are already reclamation soldiers in Xing'an. Due to financial reasons, they have not been able to fully reclaim the land. If tens of thousands of Shi's troops are suddenly added, there will be no houses for them to be stationed in. In the future, when funds are sufficient and preparations are complete, Shi's troops may be allowed to go for reclamation. He suspended his trip to Beiping and will go south to Beijing at the beginning of next month and then go to Shanghai to travel abroad. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>The Salt Transport Commissioner of Changlu Expresses His Views on the New Salt Law</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Hong Weiguo, the Salt Transport Commissioner of Changlu, said that the new salt law under the Legislative Yuan system is indeed appropriate. However, the situation in Changlu is complex, and there may be difficulties in implementation in the future. 1. The Changlu salt area is 2,000 square miles in length and breadth, with only three smuggling suppression battalions. Fortunately, more than 100 counties along the coast have raised salt guards to prevent smuggling. Once the coastal defenses are abolished, smuggled salt will flood in and cannot be prevented. The annual sales of Changlu salt are more than 3 million packages, and the tax revenue reaches 10 million yuan. If the tax revenue is short, it will inevitably affect the foreign debts guaranteed by the salt tax. 2. After the abolition of the coastal defenses, a large number of salt merchants will inevitably lose their jobs, and due to the relationship between merchants and agents, it will affect bank loans and the pledging of salt affairs agencies. Considering the 2,000 square miles of the salt area, at least 20 smuggling suppression battalions are needed, and the addition of guns, equipment, and uniforms requires huge amounts of money. The unemployment of salt merchants is a matter of people's livelihood, and the increase in the number of smuggling suppression battalions affects the issue of tax revenue. It is expected that the government will have a careful consideration before the promulgation of the new salt law. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Important Foreign News</p>
<h3>Full Text of the German-Austrian Tariff Agreement Published</h3>
<p>League of Nations Expresses Welcome</p>
<p>Sweden and Norway Follow Suit</p>
<p>French Newspapers Still Hold Opposing Views</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - The full text of the German-Austrian customs draft agreement is scheduled to be published tonight. It is expected that the debate in the capitals of various countries regarding this matter will also have a major new stimulus. As far as it is known, the agreement states the principle of establishing a customs union between Germany and Austria, preserving the independence of the two countries, and respecting obligations to other countries. Previously, French Foreign Minister Briand had advocated that countries conclude partial agreements to remedy the European economic situation, and this new German-Austrian agreement is based on this intention. The two countries now want to unify the customs system and seek coordination of commercial policies. At the same time, commercial goods between the two countries, except for monopoly products such as matches, tobacco, and beer, are all tax-free. However, the customs of the two countries still exist separately, and the tax revenues obtained are distributed to the two countries. Both countries still have the right to conclude commercial agreements with other countries, but they must jointly conduct these agreements as much as possible. The draft agreement also stipulates that after the formal treaty is concluded in the future, the validity period will be five years. Furthermore, each country may negotiate with a third country to join the customs union.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 23rd - Various aspects of the League of Nations have expressed a warm welcome to the German-Austrian customs agreement, considering it a cornerstone in the process of European economic stability. The League of Nations has repeatedly requested countries joining the League to conclude partial agreements, believing that it is easier to unite five or six partial agreements into a large unity than to harmonize the interests of twenty-seven countries. It is reported that Scandinavia is also in the process of a similar agreement, which can be compared with the German-Austrian agreement in the future. Members of the League of Nations also believe that the German-Austrian agreement does not conflict with the charter of the League of Nations and other agreements. They are willing to present this matter to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and the court will probably hold the same view. However, there are many anti-German groups in various countries, and Germany should be very cautious when concluding treaties with other countries to avoid giving the great powers an excuse.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - Foreign Minister Curtius met with the British, French, and Italian ambassadors this afternoon to exchange views on the terms of the agreement. Curtius repeatedly solemnly declared that the agreement does not violate the Treaties of Versailles, Saint-Germain, and Geneva, and that countries willing to join the agreement are welcome. Therefore, the claim that a customs union will lead to a political union is an overestimation. As for the German government's reaction to foreign countries, it is very satisfied, and even the voices of opposition are considered to be within expectations. After the facts are clear, they will gradually disappear.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 24th - The Vienna Neue Freie Presse stated this morning that Germany and Austria have not made a definite decision regarding the customs agreement. When the representatives of France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia came to protest to the Austrian Foreign Minister, the Austrian Foreign Minister told them that no decision had yet been made. Germany and Austria only expressed their willingness to open negotiations to establish a customs and trade agreement.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 23rd - Public opinion continues to unanimously oppose the new German-Austrian customs agreement, and predicts that the Allied Powers will rise up and resist in unison. However, there is no official expression of opinion. Today's cabinet meeting discussed the issue in detail, and the President also attended. According to the communiqué, Foreign Minister Briand detailed the points of contention caused by the agreement. The entire cabinet then voted in favor of the Foreign Minister's steps to negotiate with other powers to ensure that the current agreement is not broken by this agreement.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Rome, 24th - Yesterday, the Czech ambassador specially visited the Romanian Prime Minister, urging Romania to join the protest against the German-Austrian economic agreement. The conversation was very long. Afterward, after meeting with the French ambassador, the Romanian Prime Minister immediately sent his secretary to invite the German ambassador to the prime minister's residence for a meeting. Subsequently, a cabinet meeting was held, deciding to instruct the ambassadors stationed in Germany and Austria to declare to the governments of the two countries that Romania fully supports preferential treatment and partial European trade and customs agreements, provided that these agreements do not conflict with existing treaties.</p>
<h3>Three Indians Executed by Hanging in Police Chief Assassination Case</h3>
<p>Government Has No Intention of Relinquishing Power</p>
<p>Sacrifice of Revolutionaries Praiseworthy</p>
<p>Reuters, Lahore, 23rd - Three Indians related to the assassination of a police chief three years ago, who were previously sentenced to death by the court, were scheduled to be executed by hanging today. Although there were petitions for clemency, believing that pardoning their death sentences would have a positive impact on the political situation, and the chairman of the All-India Congress Reception Committee also indicated that amnesty would endorse participation in the Round Table Conference, the court was unwilling to let political considerations influence its judgment. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed and the original sentence was upheld.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 24th - Jawaharlal Nehru, referring to the execution of the three Indians in the assassination case, said that when Britain talks about a resolution, there will be the corpses of Bhagat Singh and others between the two sides. Gandhi published an article today, stating that the hanging was a major mistake on the part of the Indian government, but that we should not be angry because of this and accuse the government of undermining the resolution. The spirit of sacrifice and courage of the assassins are truly praiseworthy, but their methods should not be imitated. He also said that the government still expresses its inhumane power to intimidate public opinion, implying that it is unwilling to relinquish its power. However, the All-India Congress should still approve the resolution recently concluded by him with the Indian Viceroy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Karachi, 24th - Today, there was a procession in the All-India Congress venue here, each carrying a black flag, shouting</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>"Long live Bhagat Singh!" The anger of the people is clearly visible. The flag at the venue was flown at half-mast, the flag was tricolor.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 24th - Indian Nationalist Party leaders spoke in the Legislative Assembly today to protest the hanging of Bhagat Singh. British members stated that for the benefit of India, the law should not be interfered with, and legislators should not abandon their duties. Upon hearing this, all Nationalist Party members walked out of the meeting.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - In the House of Commons today, someone asked about the impact of the Irwin-Gandhi Agreement on the British textile industry. The Secretary of State for India, Benn, replied that it would be best to watch with patience. The current situation is not unfavorable.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Arrives in Paris</h3>
<p>To Attend Pan-European Economic Conference</p>
<p>Guomin, Paris, 24th - British Foreign Secretary Henderson arrived here last night to attend the League of European Economic Committee meeting. He had a lengthy meeting with French Foreign Minister Briand this morning. It is expected that the talks were about the new German-Austrian economic agreement. However, the failure of German Foreign Minister Curtius and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi to attend inevitably reduced the interest of the meeting.</p>
<h3>British Liberal Party Still Cooperates with Current Cabinet</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - Liberal Party members who had previously served in the cabinet met in George's Room in the House of Commons tonight to discuss the talks held by party leader George with current government officials at the end of last week regarding closer cooperation between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. This meeting was an informal meeting, and Sir Simon and other former cabinet members who opposed cooperation with the Labor government attended. It is heard that Sir Simon's faction has a very firm attitude. This meeting did not have any substantial results, and it is feared that a valuable official statement cannot be issued. In addition to Sir Simon's faction of more than ten people, there is another faction in the Liberal Party that supports preserving the Labor government, but does not want to be bound by voting in favor of the government in all matters. Furthermore, it is reported that a majority of former Liberal cabinet members support cooperating with the current government on policies common to the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. In essence, this move does not change the existing situation.</p>

The lady had a sister who remained unmarried her entire life and passed away ten years earlier.

<h3>Representatives from Henan and Gansu Request Issuance of Disaster Relief Bonds for the Two Provinces</h3>
<p>Li Huanjing, representative of the Henan Relief Association, and Shui Zi and Niu Zaikun, representatives of the Gansu Relief Association, submitted a special request to the National Government yesterday to issue disaster relief bonds worth 20 million yuan, to provide relief for the severe disasters in Henan and Gansu provinces. The original submission is as follows: "The provinces of Henan and Gansu have suffered from years of disasters, property has been lost, families have been scattered, and countless people have died from the ravages of war, cold and starvation, rape and abduction, and disease. The circumstances of the disasters over the years have been telegraphed and reported, and the victims have made their own statements. Although relief funds have been issued repeatedly for separate relief efforts, the disasters are severe and widespread, making it difficult to provide universal assistance. We now submit to Your Excellency a report on the recent tragic situation in the two provinces. Henan Province has suffered from repeated droughts and locust plagues, as well as floods and droughts. In addition to the devastation of war, it has also suffered from communist disasters. None of the 112 counties in the province have been spared. Livestock has been exhausted, and food is non-existent. The young and strong are unwilling to starve to death and resort to desperate measures, while the old and weak are unable to escape and die in ditches. War trenches crisscross, waiting to be filled. Villages are in ruins, and chimneys are smokeless. Since the beginning of spring, the general population has been searching for food everywhere, gathering in Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou, numbering no less than 100,000 people. This has caused trains to be temporarily suspended due to congestion. There is no food for reception and no funds for transfer. The cries day and night are unbearable to hear. This is the recent tragic situation in Henan Province, and relief is urgently needed. In addition to droughts and locust plagues, Gansu Province has suffered the most from soldiers and bandits. Statistics show that more than 60 counties have been affected by the disaster, and more than 2 million people have starved to death. In addition, Feng's army occupied Gansu for five years, exploiting and squeezing every ounce of grease. Selling wives and children is a daily occurrence. Last autumn, the bandit army ravaged almost all 13 counties in Longnan. According to investigations, more than 110,000 people were slaughtered, with the slaughter of more than 8,000 people in the entire city of Lixian being the most tragic. Homes were destroyed, and families were lost. However, due to its remote location in the western frontier and obstructed transportation, the five years of devastation could not be reported. With insufficient funds and exhausted food, people are sitting and waiting to die. What is even more worrying is that since last winter, rain and snow have been delayed, and spring plowing has failed to sow seeds. The great disaster of tomorrow is unpredictable. This is the current tragic situation in Gansu Province, and</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>relief is urgently needed. The suffering and death in the two provinces of Henan and Gansu are unprecedented in recent centuries. Now that unification has been achieved and the whole country is celebrating, the people of Henan and Gansu provinces are still struggling in deep water and fiery heat. It is hoped that Your Excellency will not be able to bear it. However, given the severity of the disasters in the two provinces, it is difficult to provide universal relief without a large amount of relief funds. We propose that disaster-stricken people be cared for, and that disaster relief bonds worth 20 million yuan be approved for issuance, so that the victims in the two provinces can be rescued and their livelihoods can be restored. We are extremely grateful and await your orders."</p>
<h3>Jiang's Various Armies Encircle Zhu Mao</h3>
<p>He Yingqin Cables Fujian and Guangdong to Block and Suppress</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, After He Yingqin issued the general offensive order a few days ago, all the units suppressing bandits in Jiangxi have been advancing bravely. At present, the 5th Route Army, 26th Route Army, 6th Route Army, and 19th Route Army have deployed battle lines to encircle the Zhu Mao bandits. The Zhu Mao bandits are now gathered at the border of Guangchang, Ningdu, Ruijin, Huichang, and Shicheng. They are extremely panicked due to a shortage of bullets. There is also a trend of retreating towards the Fujian-Guangdong border. He Yingqin specially telegraphed Guangdong and Fujian to send troops to block and intercept. The 8th Route Army's two divisions of Liu and Zhang in the northeast of Guangdong and the border of Fujian have been deployed thoroughly. Zhu Mao will definitely not escape. Furthermore, He Yingqin is paying close attention to local party affairs, politics, and all post-disaster matters after the communist bandits are eliminated. He has telegraphed the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government to send personnel to the front line with the army to handle everything. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Victory News from Hubei Province Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>The Entire Province Begins Village Purging</p>
<p>Wuhan's Defenses Consolidated</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, After the remnant bandits on the Pinghan Road were defeated, they fled to eastern Hubei, where they were defeated by Ge Yunlong's division. They regrouped and fled to Macheng, where they were again defeated by Xia Douyin's division. Yesterday, the 22nd, Zhu Hengbing, deputy division commander of the 13th Division, telegraphed from Macheng to Hankou, saying that the bandits were trying to flee south. On the morning of the 20th, they fled into Guan. The one battalion stationed in Lidian, together with nearby troops, immediately encircled and suppressed them. On the evening of the 20th, the bandits were defeated, and they fled towards Songziguan. They are now being tracked down and friendly forces are being telegraphed to block them, in order to annihilate them. Furthermore, the bandits in Yuanjiahe, northwest of Macheng, were also defeated by the 73rd Regiment of the division on the 21st, and the bandits have fled to the northern border of Macheng. As for the remnant forces of the He bandits, they recently fled to the area of Shadaoguan and Yanglin City in Songzi County and were also defeated by the newly formed 7th Brigade under Li Zongjian. They are now fleeing towards Liujiafang. The bandits entrenched near Diaoxian Pass in Jianli were attacked by Zhang Zhenhan's brigade of Xu Yuanquan's 48th Division. On the 20th, they captured the important locations of Wanghaichang and Zhuangjiapu. On the 21st, they recovered Diaoxiankou. Xu Yuanquan telegraphed yesterday to report the victory, saying, "My Zhang Zhenhan brigade defeated the bandits in Sishanhe City on the morning of the day and tracked them down. By 4:00 p.m., we occupied Diaoxiankou. The number of bandits killed in this battle was extremely high." Diaoxiankou is the thoroughfare between Hunan and Hubei. With its recapture, the remnant bandits in Shijian area can be eliminated.</p>
<p>He Chengjun, chairman of the Provincial Government, believed that the bandits would soon be eliminated and that village purging should begin immediately. The organizational regulations for the Provincial Village Purging Bureau and the County Village Purging Sub-bureaus have been separately stipulated. However, due to the different situations in various places, he was concerned that it would be inconvenient to implement them uniformly. It was decided to revise the regulations, and the General Bureau would be established by the 26th of this month. In addition to He serving as the director concurrently, Wu Xingya, director of the Civil Affairs Department, would serve as the deputy director concurrently, and Zhang Gang, chief of staff of the Security Department, would serve as the director of bureau affairs concurrently. County village purging sub-bureaus have been established in Hanyang, Xiaogan, Xianning, Chongyang, Yingcheng, Yunmeng, Tongshan, Jiayu, Sui County, Jianli, and other counties. The remaining counties are also in the process of organizing. It is reported that the organizational content of the county sub-bureaus includes four groups: organization, investigation, propaganda, and supervision. In addition, the masses who have not joined the Red Bandits are organized into Communist Eradication Teams to create registers of good and bad citizens, and to register self-renewal, so that those who have not joined the bandits and communists will not be deceived, and those who have joined the bandits and communists can repent and start anew. As the counties have suffered from bandits for a long time, they are specially allowed to reduce or exempt rent and taxes as appropriate, and emergency relief is provided to the counties that have suffered the most, in order to restore the vitality of the countryside.</p>
<p>As for the defense of Wuhan, the 11th and 14th Divisions have arrived one after another, and the defense has become more consolidated. Commander-in-Chief Chiang believed that Wuhan was an important upstream town and that security was extremely important. On the 22nd, he specially telegraphed Xia Douyin, commander of the Wuhan Garrison, and Qian Dajun, commander of the Wuhan Fortress, to strictly defend against any problems. As Wuhan had previously been divided into garrison and fortress areas, it was specifically designated that Qian Dajun, commander of the fortress, would be responsible for the fortress area, and Xia Douyin, commander of the garrison, would be responsible for the garrison area. Between the fortress area and the garrison area, the two departments would jointly patrol to ensure thoroughness. After receiving the order, the garrison and fortress departments implemented strict security measures on the 23rd. The division of the garrison area was stipulated by the Wuhan Headquarters. In addition to the urban area of Wuhan, all areas of Mabin Camp, Sanyanqiao, Cigarette Factory, Gongfang Camp, Yangsimiao, Shooting Range, Dengjiawan, Wangjiawan, Xujiapeng, and Bamboo and Wood Collection Bureau are under the jurisdiction of the garrison department. The area adjacent to the above locations is the outer patrol zone. In addition, all nearby areas are under the jurisdiction of the fortress area.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Implements Austerity Policy</h3>
<p>Annual Reduction of More Than 2.28 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Monthly Deficit of More Than 200,000 Yuan Remains</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence, Since the abolition of consolidated taxes in Hunan Province on January 1, monthly revenue has decreased by 600,000 yuan. Zhang Kailian, director of the Finance Department, traveled to the capital and repeatedly negotiated with Minister Soong, who finally agreed to subsidize Hunan Province's government expenses by 200,000 yuan per month from the central government, but the deficit remained large. After Zhang Kailian returned to Hunan, he submitted a proposal to the Provincial Government to hold a provincial affairs meeting and decided to implement an austerity policy, reducing personnel and streamlining administration to maintain operations. He issued orders to various departments to draft reduction measures within their respective jurisdictions and submit them for review. He also held a joint meeting of the Party and Government to greatly reduce party fees. The results of the austerity measures for Party and Government fees throughout the province were compiled into a general register by the Provincial Government yesterday. It was estimated that Party affairs fees would be reduced by 256,000 yuan per year, the Provincial Government by 180,000 yuan per year, the Civil Affairs Department by 363,440 yuan per year, the Finance Department by 675,752 yuan per year, the Construction Department by 410,853 yuan per year, the High Court by 201,178 yuan per year, and the office expenses of Party and Government agencies throughout the province would be paid at 80% across the board, reducing 195,240 yuan per year. The total annual reduction was 2,282,463 yuan. According to Zhang Kailian, the government expenses of this province require 1.04 million yuan per month. After this austerity, it still requires more than 800,000 yuan. On the revenue side, the average monthly calculation is about 200,000 yuan from land tax, about 100,000 yuan from various regular taxes and donations, and the business tax has not yet been implemented. It is estimated that 100,000 yuan can be collected in the future. Together with the central government subsidy of 200,000 yuan, the total is only more than 600,000 yuan per month. The monthly income and expenditure still have a deficit of more than 200,000 yuan. Now that there is nothing left to reduce, Hunan's financial situation is not easy to solve. (March 21)</p>
<h3>Shandong Authorities Decide to Suppress Bandits at Baodugu</h3>
<p>Cao Fulin Leads Troops Eastward</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, Sun Meisong's bandits at Baodugu have become increasingly rampant recently. Han Fuju returned to Jinan from northern Shandong yesterday and, as soon as he got off the train, ordered Cao Fulin, commander of the 29th Division, at the station to lead his troops to Qingzhou to suppress the bandits. The original order was to depart at 7:00 p.m. that evening, so the Jiaoji Road prepared two troop trains at 5:00 p.m. to open the Zhangzhuang camp to transport Cao's troops. A special train was also prepared for Han Fuju. The train was loaded at 8:00 p.m. and then ordered to depart this morning, because Cao Fulin telegraphed that he would return to Jinan this morning to supervise the troops eastward. At 7:30 a.m. today, Cao returned to Jinan by special train from Ji'ning. After getting off the train, he went to the Provincial Government to meet with Han to inquire about everything. It was heard that he would lead his troops eastward this afternoon, and Han Fuju will also take a special train eastward this afternoon to inspect the Qingzhou and Linqu areas. As for the recent bandit situation, according to those who fled from Yizhou to Jinan, Sun Meisong attacked Zaozhuang a few days ago, wanting to imitate his younger brother Meiyao's old tricks and rob the Jinpu train, but he was unsuccessful. He then joined forces with the bandits in Yizhou and Linqu and fled east, burning more than 60 villages in a row. Its cruelty is almost no less than the communist disaster in Jiangxi. (March 22)</p>
<h3>Zhu Peide's Situation in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Inspected the Seventh Division on the 23rd</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence, Zhu Peide arrived in Xuzhou on the 22nd to inspect the army. Zhu left Beijing on the evening of the 18th and arrived in Bengbu on the morning of the 19th, where he inspected the 45th Division. On the morning of the 22nd, he left Bengbu for the north at 11:30 a.m. In the afternoon, the train passed Fuli Village, where he got off the train to inspect the 39th Regiment of the 7th Division stationed in Fu, led by Xi Chaomei. He did not arrive in Xuzhou until 5:00 p.m. in the evening. Representatives from all walks of life in Xuzhou, including Zhang Mingli of the County Consolidation Association, Liu Zhonglu of the District Office, Hu Lisheng of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Jun, commander of the Seventh Division, also led senior officers of the division, including Li Shilong, Li Wenbin, Qiu Yude, Zhou Lin, Shen Yuanzhen, Ma Chongliu, and Tai Zhenfu, as well as Yang Wei, county magistrate, and Qiao Jianming, director of public security, greeted him at the station. When the special train arrived at the station, Zhu came to the door of the train to greet the welcomers amidst the sound of military music. Then, he met with representatives from all walks of life on the train. At that time, the reporter visited Zhu. According to him, the inspection area includes the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan lines, and the troops stationed in Bengbu, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Tongguan, Huayin, Xuchang, and Hankou will be inspected. It was originally scheduled to be completed in two months, but now it is planned to be completed in more than a month in order to shorten the time, so each place will only be delayed for three or four days at most. The inspection team responsible for this inspection is divided into two teams, the first team is led by Director Wu Qingzhi, and the second team is led by Director Fan Yuhuang. It is expected that the first team will be responsible for Bengbu, Bian, Luoyang, and other places, and the second team will be responsible for Xuzhou, Zheng, Tong, and other places. This inspection focuses on investigating the post-war reorganization and training of various units, in order to become the elite troops of the country. After the interview, the representatives withdrew, and Zhu summoned the personnel of the Seventh Division on the train to give instructions. Those who came with Zhu included Yuan Jixi and Yang Zhennan, staff officers of the General Staff Headquarters, Li and Tong, two adjutants of the General Headquarters Adjutant Office. The first inspection team is still in Bengbu, finishing the inspection affairs. The second inspection team started the inspection in Xuzhou early. After Zhu arrived in Xuzhou, he decided to personally inspect the Xuzhou troops of the Seventh Division at Jiuli Mountain on the morning of the 23rd. The troops inspected included Wang Kaizhen's 37th Regiment of the 19th Brigade, Gao Qikun's 38th Regiment, Hu Yan's 41st Regiment of the 21st Brigade, Chen Shaohan's 42nd Regiment, the cadre training team, the artillery battalion, and the cavalry company, totaling about 8,000 people. Wang Jun also led all the officers of the Seventh Division to the field. At 8:00 a.m., Zhu led the inspection committee member Fan Yuhuang and others, as well as Yuan Xuxi and Yang Zhennan, and two German advisors, to the field by car.

Wang then ordered the various units to hold a review, first the cadre training team, then the various regiments of the 19th Brigade, then the various regiments of the 21st Brigade, then the artillery battalion, and the cavalry company. Only the engineering battalion was on duty for city defense that day, and the transport battalion was on guard, so they were not included. The various units passed in front of the reviewing platform in order, and the order was very neat. After the review, Zhu led the inspection committee to the barracks to hold examinations for officers, with the subjects being the Party doctrine tactics for school officers, the model order for lieutenants, and the artillery and cavalry model order for military supply officers, managers, accountants, military medical officers, and military medicine, which lasted for one hour and twenty minutes.

A mixed regiment confrontation exercise will be held in the field on the 25th. It is expected to be completed in Xuzhou in three days, and then go to Bian. As for whether to inspect the 12th Division by the way, it will depend on whether there is enough time to spare. It has not yet been determined. (March 23)</p>
<h3>Henan Province Plans to Move 100,000 Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Continuing to the Northeast to Reclaim Wasteland and Obtain Food</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence, The Henan Provincial Relief Association plans to continue to move 100,000 disaster victims to the three northeastern provinces this year, following the immigration methods of previous years, to reclaim wasteland and obtain food. It had previously telegraphed the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to request consent. The Political Affairs Committee stated that as spring plowing was imminent and the current situation in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, whether they could accommodate a certain number, must be planned first. Therefore, the three provincial authorities were ordered to discuss and report. After receiving the order, the Liaoning Provincial Government stated that 100,000 disaster victims from Henan Province had come east last year, and 60,000 were accommodated by Jiangsu Province, and 20,000 each by Liaoning and Jilin. Since Liaoning Province suffered from floods last year, local disaster victims were in urgent need of relocation. The current situation is different from the past. It is difficult to predict how many can be accommodated. Yesterday, the Civil Affairs Department was ordered to investigate the needs of each county and allocate them appropriately for review and transfer. The order is as follows: "According to the instructions of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, Zhang Fang, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Relief Association, telegraphed that he was extremely grateful for the past immigration efforts. However, due to military affairs, he was unable to send them continuously according to the original plan. Because the disaster in Henan has become more severe and it is difficult to provide relief, he has discussed with Chairman Liu of Henan and the Relief Association in Beijing to continue to move 100,000 disaster victims to the northeastern provinces this year to reclaim wasteland and obtain food. He sincerely hopes that Your Excellency will have compassion on the disaster in Henan, and refer to the successful cases of the previous year to approve the transfer of orders to the three provincial governments to designate locations and allocate them separately, so as to benefit the survivors. If you agree, please telegraph as soon as possible to facilitate progress, and be infinitely grateful, etc. It has been handled that the disaster victims from Henan Province are transferred to Guanzhong for food. Subsequently, the transportation was temporarily suspended in the late autumn of last year, and separate orders were issued to know each on record. Now, according to the association, it plans to send 100,000 disaster victims to the three provinces for resettlement. The number of people is large and the flow of goods is uneven. If there is no overall planning in advance, it is feared that it will cause abuses. Now that spring plowing is approaching, how many can the province accommodate at present? It is urgent to prepare in advance to determine the method. In addition to replying to the association that the transfer will be suspended, and separate orders, it is hereby ordered that the provincial government shall quickly draft and report for review and processing. This order, etc., according to this, the 100,000 disaster victims who came east from Henan Province last year were ordered by the Political Affairs Committee to accommodate 60,000 people in Jiangsu Province, and the remaining 40,000 people were allocated half by Liaoning and Jilin provinces. This year, the situation has changed and the situation in each county is different from last year. How much it can accommodate should be investigated by the office to understand the needs of each county, allocated appropriately, and report the list of allocated counties and the number of people to be received quickly for review and transfer.

<p>Jealousy Murder Case in Wangxia Village: Yin Zhiyu, a villager from Shiqiaowan Township near Xiaohe Town in Wuyi, had a son named Heshang who worked at Zou Yilong's house in Wangxia Village. He had an affair with the wife of Liu Laigen in the neighborhood. But Liu's wife had previously been involved with Liu Anbao. The night before last, Anbao saw Heshang at Laigen's house and attacked Heshang with a sharp blade. Heshang fled to the Zhang family's door, but was caught by Anbao, who slashed him twice, severing his right lung and left rib. Heshang immediately collapsed to the ground, and Anbao took the opportunity to escape. Yin Zhiyu found out and reported it to the Xiaohe Town Public Security Bureau. He had the injured man taken to the Wujin Hospital in the city for treatment and informed the County Court to send someone to examine the injuries. However, the injured man died at noon on the 23rd due to his serious injuries. Judge Ju of the County Court led officials to examine the body on the 24th for investigation.</p>
<p>Major Theft in a Bustling City: Qianqiufang in Wuyi City is a bustling marketplace.

<p>The Xichang Section of the Xichang Provincial Highway is Actively Underway: The Xichang section of the Yichang Provincial Highway was planned and started by former Construction Bureau Director Yao Dixin in April of last year, but was soon suspended due to unforeseen circumstances. After a year's delay, most of the marked centerlines were lost. Now, Construction Bureau Director Mao is continuing the construction. However, due to the limited time, there is not enough time for detailed surveying. It is planned to conduct simple center elevation measurements simultaneously with the conscription of labor, in order to plan the entire 45-li (Chinese mile) line, passing through six districts and divided into seven sections. Once a section is surveyed, labor will be conscripted to proceed concurrently. The survey is scheduled to commence on the 23rd, and letters have been sent to the district heads and section chiefs along the line, with the aim of collaborating and facilitating completion. If there are no other obstacles, it is expected that the survey will be completed this month and labor conscription can be implemented.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Provincial Commissioner Comes to Chengqing to Clear Old Debts: The Finance Department Commissioner Cheng Jingchuan came to Chengqing to clear old debts from the 16th, 17th, and 18th years of the Republic. After arriving in Chengqing, Commissioner Cheng contacted Director Shen of the Finance Bureau and Chief of Tax Collection Chen Peizhi regarding Jiangyin's old debts, which amounted to approximately 300,000 yuan. The reason for the accumulation was the Qi-Lu War in the Yichou year, resulting in losses from war disasters. Before the purge of the Communist Party, the farmers were misled by heretical theories, and the annual Cao tax registers were not intercepted that year. It is now very difficult to start clearing up the debts.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Union Dissolved: The Jiangyin Rickshaw Union, organized and established by Yao Mingzhi and others, was recently instructed by the Provincial Reorganization Committee, based on an order from the Provincial Reorganization Committee, to temporarily suspend organization, even though rickshaw pullers are physical laborers, as they are not based on an employer-employee relationship. The committee also ordered that rickshaw pullers be trained to improve their intelligence. After receiving the order, Committee Member Zhongchang immediately ordered the Rickshaw Union to dissolve immediately.</p>
<p>Petition to Punish Fan Gongzhi: Fan Gongzhi, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau, led a team to inspect rooms at the Dadong Inn outside the North Gate the night before last. In Room 20, they uncovered the blankets of travelers Wu Yuanxun and his wife, exposing them naked and making them freeze and be ridiculed. In Room 9, they uncovered the quilt of Lu Zihui and scattered steel coins around his pillow. The travelers made a great commotion and questioned the innkeeper, Wang Peiqing, reporting to the Inn Union and petitioning the party and government agencies to uphold justice. After the County Party Department sent someone to investigate and found the report to be true, the committee resolved to send a letter to the county to deal with the matter strictly. Unexpectedly, the Public Security Bureau only relied on Fan Gongzhi's report, without questioning the travelers or searching their luggage. Wang Peiqing does not know what hatred he has incurred that he has so lost his conscience and fabricated accusations. Yesterday, the Dadong Inn submitted another petition to the union, which forwarded it to the county, requesting the withdrawal and punishment of Fan.</p>

<p>County Government Pledges Jishi's Public Beach Fields: In the case of Liu Hai's Shaji, 1,100 mu of beach fields were over-collected in the sixth and seventh weirs.

On the 23rd, he was summoned for interrogation. Zhang refused to hand it over and the court ordered him to be taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Additional 300,000 Waterworks Bonds to be Raised: Hangzhou's waterworks are expected to be operational by June 1st. As the time is pressing, various tasks urgently need to be carried out, such as laying water pipes. Funding is particularly critical. The waterworks bonds that have been raised are far from sufficient. Without quickly raising an additional 300,000 yuan in public bonds, it will be difficult to complete the project. Yesterday, the municipal government specifically requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss raising 240,000 yuan from various industries and ordered the Finance Bureau to raise 60,000 yuan locally from wealthy individuals to proceed with the project.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Freight Train Burned En Route: Yesterday at 8:00 PM, Freight Train No. 22 from Shanghai to Hangzhou, when it arrived at the Zhakou Station, discovered that a fire had broken out inside, for reasons unknown. All the goods being transported to Hangzhou were completely destroyed, resulting in significant losses. It is reported that the train car was also damaged and has been temporarily sent to the Zhakou Repair Shop for repairs.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Peasant Uprising Kills Landlord: In Zhang Chenzha, Yu Xiejiatang, landlord Chen Shenglin had a dispute with the peasants over land rent and harbored resentment. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, Chen, accompanied by tenant Shen Atu, took a small boat to Songxia Antai Village to discuss business. On their way home, when passing the Gehou Bridge near Gaishan, seven or eight peasants suddenly came and forced the helmsman to row to Nanhu. Then six or seven hundred peasants came and dragged Chen Linsheng to Banhu Nunnery, where they beat him to death immediately. They then threw the corpse into the river. Tenant Shen Atu seized the opportunity to escape and fortunately was not harmed. After the peasants beat Chen Linsheng to death, they planned to burn Chen Linsheng's house. This was heard by the security team stationed in Yiting, which immediately sent soldiers to Chen's house to suppress the uprising. Thousands of peasants swarmed in and surrounded the security team, firing shots as a warning. Seeing the situation was not good, the security team opened fire in self-defense, wounding six or seven peasants. The rest fled in disarray.</p>

<p>Elderly Couple Lose Lives for Their Son: A Shen from Zhongtan, Nanxiang, went to Hangzhou with his son last year. His son suddenly disappeared. At that time, he searched everywhere but could not find him. Unexpectedly, on the 20th of this month, he received a letter from his son saying that he had gone to Sichuan. Shen, because his son had traveled far away and did not return, had a mental breakdown. He shouldered a package and planned to go to Sichuan to bring him back. When he walked to the bank of the Qiantang River, he waded into the water to cross. Before reaching the center of the river, he drowned. His wife heard the news and hanged herself at midnight the next day.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>Knife-Wounded Floating Corpse Discovered in Xianzi Shoal: A knife-wounded floating corpse was suddenly discovered in the Xianzi Shoal of Shengzi Weir, Lianhua Dou Township, Pingwang District, in this county yesterday. The local farmers reported it to the District Office and the Public Security Sub-Bureau and requested an investigation. District Chief Ding Jiaying and Sub-Bureau Chief Zhuang Jiancen immediately telegraphed the County Government to send someone to examine the body. It was found that the corpse was wearing a sanitary shirt and trousers, was bald, had no shoes, had a knife wound on the front chest, and both feet were tied with rope. The testicles were detached from the scrotum, suggesting a love affair-related murder and the body was moved to the river.</p>

<h3>Tsinghua's New President Wu Nanxuan Speaks</h3>
<p>Governing the School with Impartiality as the Principle</p>
<p>Adopting Opinions Presented by Representatives</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 23rd), Wu Nanxuan, the new president of Tsinghua University, met with student representatives from the Central Political School and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Tsinghua is a school with a special history, sufficient funding, a beautiful environment, and mostly excellent students. It has many opportunities for future development. After the successful Northern Expedition in 1928, the government appointed Mr. Luo Jialun as president. The achievements in the past two years have been very good. Recently, he suddenly became passive and firmly requested to resign. The government initially earnestly tried to retain him, but Mr. Luo's intention to resign remained unwavering. Recently, he was asked to take responsibility for the Central Political School, so his resignation was approved and I was appointed to succeed him. I am deeply aware that my knowledge and qualifications are insufficient, but as I have been appointed by the Party and the country, I have no choice but to fulfill my responsibilities to the best of my ability. As for the specific plan for the development of Tsinghua, it must be decided after arriving at the school. However, in general, I can say that there are several points: (1) Abide by Chairman Chiang's opinions on rectifying the academic atmosphere. (2) Based on the Ministry of Education's previous plan for the development of Tsinghua, and with reference to the actual environment, manage it step by step with a spirit of fearlessness and a method of peace and stability. (3) Employ people based on talent, and never employ private individuals. I have no private individuals. (4) Treat people with sincerity and openness. I deeply despise the use of manipulation. (5) Strictly adhere to the spirit of the rule of law in handling affairs. (6) Adopt the suggestions of students and professors as much as possible within the possible range. (7) Pay attention to balanced development, without favoring any aspect. (8) Improve the atmosphere of academic research. (9) Pay attention to the cultivation and training of morality and personality. I will do my best according to the above points, hoping to create a perfect school, so as not to fail the history and environment of Tsinghua.</p>
<p>The student representatives immediately put forward an outline of the plan for the revitalization of Tsinghua based on the opinions of the students of the school: (1) The necessary attitude of the president: (A) Dedicate all energy to managing Tsinghua. (B) Center education on students and adopt students' opinions as much as possible. (C) All finances are completely open. (D) Employ people entirely based on talent. (2) Special care should be taken in selecting the Dean of Academic Affairs. (3) Increase construction. (4) Expand the campus. (5) Hire excellent professors. (6) Enrich the content of each department. (7) Improve and develop the Graduate School. (8) Rectify the library. (9) Rectify the hospital. (10) Actively promote physical education. (11) Promote publishing matters. (12) Promote the connection between teachers and students. (13) Establish a liaison mechanism for students inside and outside the school. (14) Establish a career placement mechanism. (15) Increase examination locations. (16) Increase graduation trip subsidies for students. (17) Eliminate all fees for learning music. (18) Reduce tuition fees. Wu replied that he completely adopted the principles and spirit. The more concrete items must be considered and handled after arriving at the school.

<h3>Gold Market Sees Reversal in Financial Bidding</h3>
<p>A disastrous fall of 23 taels. Yesterday, March 24th, the reversal in the gold market was very strong. It has broken through the 700 tael mark, and the downward trend is fierce. However, the situation is still hesitant, with reversals of six or seven taels from time to time. The total difference for the day was as much as 23 taels, with a disastrous fall of 23 or 4 taels. The waves were treacherous, and people were panic-stricken. As for the trend of foreign exchange, it was loose and weak, and the listed prices did not change. Trading in the market was still active, but generally there was an oversupply. In the previous market, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Hengxing, and others all purchased. Hengxingyuan, Xinxian, and large speculators have all sold out. The overseas silver market was mediocre. The gold price almost opened low. After that, the selling was very strong, and it broke through 700 taels. Because of the purchase of hedging companies and the weakness of British gold, it went out of the customs again. Later, the selling momentum of large households was strong, and exchange rates were easily weak. It is estimated that British gold rose by 125, and the bank's buying price increased from 138125 to 9375. As a result, the gold price fell sharply by more than 10 taels. In the later market, it was initially weak, followed by advances and retreats of three or four taels. Large households such as Hongxing, Qianchangxiang, Hengxingyuan, and Tianfengyong tended to sell. In addition, exchange rates were particularly weak, resulting in a sharp drop in gold prices. The downward trend was unstoppable, and it suddenly plummeted by more than 10 taels, and then suddenly fell to the 680 tael mark. It is expected that large bars should rise this morning. Recently, the spot gold price has been about two taels lower than the futures price.</p>
<p>Opened Low Early in the Morning: The May opening in the morning fell by 2 taels and 3 qian to 702 taels. Although there was no change in the large bars, the market was flat, and private telegrams had risen by one-eighth. Afterwards, there were slight fluctuations of one or two taels, ranging from 1.5 to 3 taels. Yuan Cheng, Hengxingyuan, Zhifengyong, Wanxing, and others sold very strongly, falling to 7 or 8 taels, only 695 taels and 5 qian. Not long after, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Dadecheng, and others bought in, and Mai Hang and Taiwan bought June British gold at 139375. Therefore, the price was first announced at 699 taels and 5 qian, but the listed price did not change, slightly less than 1.5 taels. Hengxing and Fuchang then entered again, and British gold improved. HSBC bought June 875, Mitsui entered July 8125, and at 10 o'clock it rose to 704 taels. Suddenly, it showed weakness again. Large households such as Hengxingyuan, Chengfengyong, Dadecheng, and Yuancheng came to sell. In addition, British gold turned loose. Banks did mutual business in June at 875, and Japanese banks bought 9375. As a result, the gold price plummeted by more than 7 taels. At 11:00, it was 96 taels and 5 qian. Items slightly entered and increased to 99 taels. Qianchangxiang and others sold again, and it was not easy to support. It has now plummeted by 7 taels. At 11:30, it was 92 taels, and after entering, it was slightly pulled up by more than 2 taels, totaling 94 taels and 5 qian. At noon, the market closed at 93 taels and 8 qian, and it was suppressed again to 92 taels. The posted price was 757 taels and 8 qian, totaling 63 or 4 qian.</p>
<p>Later Market Worsened: The later market opened at 89 taels, which was the aftermath of the noon closing, and it was sold by Shunli Wanxing, etc. Later, Cuichangren, Shunli, Wanxing, etc. bought again, and it rose to 94 taels. The exchange rate was flat, and Mitsui absorbed Dalian at 2 qian and 5 fen 2. Suddenly, large households sold, and because British gold was sold at 140000, at 2:30 it was 91 taels. Then there was a rise and fall of more than 2 taels. At 3:15, there were rumors that Japanese banks were absorbing cash, and it rose to 93 taels and 5 qian. At 3:30, Taixing, Chengfengcheng, Hengxingyuan, Hongxing, Fuyu, etc. were sold heavily, especially British gold was more discounted. The bank's buying price was 14125, and later 1875 was still difficult to sell. As a result, the market was sluggish, and there was a sudden drop of more than 12 or 3 taels. However, there were 2 or 3 taels in between. At 4:30, the minimum price closed at 681 taels, and then depreciated by 2 taels to 79 taels. Tianfengyong and others sold a lot, falling back by 23 taels and 3 qian compared to the previous day (according to the listed price), which is the reverse direction of the two-day continuous rise. It is found that the maximum price for the whole day was 704 taels, and the minimum price was 681 taels, with a difference of 23 taels. The item was 0.01 taels and 5 qian in the morning market, 93 taels and 5 qian at noon closing, 89 taels and 5 qian in the afternoon, and 79 taels and 5 qian at the closing. The posted price totaled 77 or 8 qian. The registration in the morning was 87 taels in March, 90 taels in April, and 94 taels and 10 in May. Noon was 81 taels in March, 84 taels in April, and 88 taels in May. The supplementary water was 87 taels, and 81 taels in the afternoon.

<p>Market Oversupply: According to the transaction of each number, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Hengxing, Shengda, Tongtaichang, Wanxing, Shunli, etc. all accounted for the buying side. Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Qianchangxiang, etc. entered and exited suddenly, with a very large number. Hengxingyuan, Yuandayong, and speculator Wu, etc. all exited. Cuichangyong exited and then entered. In the afternoon, Chengfengyong, Hongxing Hengxingyuan, Tianfengyong, Hongli, Qianchangxiang, Taixing, Yuancheng, and Lu, etc. all exited. Wanxing, Yongshunli, Yuantai, and Yu Da entered different amounts. Cuichangyong entered first and then exited, while Hengxing Fuchang entered. Guangdong helped to chase and enter a total of more than 1,000 bars, which was a hedging exchange rate. Dalian helped to enter a total of 7 or 800 bars in the previous market, and exited more than 300 bars. A total of more than 3,000 bars in the later market were mostly even.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Initially Flat and then Deficient</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no change in the British and American silver markets, but the exchange rate saw an increase. As for HSBC's listed prices, all exchange rates did not change. However, the domestic market in the bank was initially flat and then became volatile. With the downstream of the gold market, it also became weak and tired, especially in the afternoon. The gold price plummeted by more than 20 taels and broke through the 680 tael mark, which was actually due to the sale in June. As a result, each exchange rate was higher than the previous day. It is estimated that British gold has exceeded one shilling and four pence, totaling 3125 for Changsan, American gold has increased by 625, Japanese gold has decreased by 3.5, and most of the Chinese gold industry is throwing out surface strips. It is estimated that British gold has been transacted for more than 300,000 pounds. Banks such as Mai Hang, Taiwan, Zhejiang, HSBC, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Hua Bi all absorbed them, but the price became looser and looser. Also, the Zhengjin Taiwan Shanghai slightly sold out. Also, the mutual transactions between banks are estimated to be tens of thousands of pounds. As for the American gold, there was also some mutual trading, but the Chinese participation was limited. Dalian was sold by the Dalian gang for more than 1 million yuan, and Mitsui Hua Bi bought a considerable amount. The weakness of the exchange market was actually stimulated by the gold bidding.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The domestic market had a difference of 3125. In the morning, the asking price for March and April was 1 shilling, 3 pence and 75, and the asking price for May and June was 8125. The buying price was increased by 0.0625. Bi Xing did mutual business in June at 875. Mai Hang sold 9375. After 9:30, Taiwan Meifeng entered 9375. Zhejiang Hefeng entered this month at 875.

<h3>Confusing Silver Dollar Market Conditions</h3>
<p>In recent days, the market prices of silver and silver dollars have been confusing and unpredictable. This is because the demand is not normal, and even if there is a slight improvement, it will only be temporary and short-lived. Therefore, the price rises slightly when sales are normal, and still falls when there is stagnation. As a result, it rises and falls suddenly, and the fluctuations are often minimal. According to the speculation in the industry, there seems to be no hope of development this month. Generally speaking, if imports and exports start slightly out of the month (mid-April), there may be a temporary increase in the use of silver dollar funds.</p>
<p>The discount price yesterday was low (foreign cents). The early market was 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 2 hao and a half, and the afternoon market was 7 qian 2 fen 4 li, which was 2 hao and a half smaller than the previous day's market price. Transactions were even more rare, so people felt very lazy. (Silver discount) Both the early and afternoon markets opened at 3 fen, which was half smaller than the early market the previous day. The addition of water to the planning head was as before, still about 3, 4 or 5 fen. (Auxiliary coins) The early and afternoon markets of Jiangnan small foreign coins were both 6 qian 3 fen 7 li, and there were no transactions in both markets. The early market of Guangdong small foreign coins was 6 qian 3 fen 02 hao and a half, and the afternoon market was 6 qian 3 fen 0 hao and a half, which was also the same as the two markets the previous day. The early market made 110,000 jiao, the afternoon market made 50,000 jiao, and copper yuan did not move, still 369,000 qian wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Transactions and Settlements: (Silver Funds) Yesterday, the bank's settlement news was that Chinese merchants settled more than 1.8 million in bill funds, foreign merchants settled more than 1.78 million in bill funds, and various freight taxes totaled more than 9 million.

<h3>Summary of Current Foreign News</h3>
<p>Forward Silver: There is no competition in this year's forward silver market, so there is little news to report. However, a financier mentioned yesterday that although this year's forward silver market is not as prosperous as last year, it will not disappear completely. According to recent estimates, in another week or two, there may be some activity in the financial sector, especially for those specializing in loaning funds for cocoons and mortgages. Judging from the current market situation, the difference between the forward silver price will ultimately not exceed one cent per tael.</p>
<p>Spot Silver: Recently, money shops have been purchasing large quantities of spot silver for customer needs. Shanghai-based exchange shops and financial exchange institutions have entrusted money shops to purchase on their behalf. It is reported that the amount fixed the day before yesterday exceeded two million taels, which will be shipped out within a few days. Shantou, Xiamen, and the northern route of the Yangtze River are all considering purchasing silver. If this happens, it is expected that the market price of silver will fluctuate.</p>

The 19th Year Disbandment Bonds and the 19th Year Charity Bonds each had over 1.5 million yuan and 1.1 million yuan in transactions, respectively. Other bonds were less active than before. As buyers became more active, bond prices gradually rose, showing a strong upward trend. As a result, the 20th Year Tobacco Bonds saw the largest increase compared to the previous day, with the near-term contracts rising by over two yuan and the next-month contracts rising by one and a half yuan. Other bonds rose by several jiao (tenths of a yuan) to eight or nine jiao.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Scene Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning but fell in the afternoon, with a tight trend. This is because actual sales remain strong, and intentions in the northern region are relatively strong. However, the Yangtze River route has not yet been active, so there is still hope for future development. As a result, people's hearts are very firm. Japanese merchants are still in constant negotiations regarding export transactions and complete exchange relationships, so the buying pressure remains strong and there is no intention to relax. Long positions for this month have slightly sold off, and the falling gold price has slightly dampened some sentiment. The future still depends on actual sales for progress or retreat.</p>
<p>"Ren Biao" (Human Standard) Slightly Weak: The "Ren Biao" market opened this morning with the idea that although American cotton fell, actual sales were still strong, and people's hearts were high. The opening was slightly lower, and the second and third rounds rose slightly. As a result, it rose two, three, four, or five qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price was falling, and the news of foreign cotton was not good. People's hearts suddenly became weak, and actual sales were less than before. Each month fell eight qian to one liang, two, three, or four qian. The daily transaction statistics were 30,450 bales. It was found that Gongtai sold 800 bales, 20th (number) 1,150 bales, Changfeng 1,550 bales, and Hengchang 1,100 bales. Yudda bought 1,250 bales, Gengfeng 1,050 bales, Changfeng 1,350 bales, Xincheng 1,050 bales, and Gongtai 900 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

Customer groups brought in 425 bales from the mainland, 570 bales from Tianjin, 290 bales from Yunnan, 130 bales from Jiangxi, 105 bales from Sichuan, 1,050 bales from Qingdao, and 200 bales from miscellaneous groups.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Loosens and Trends Soft</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned weak due to weak conditions in the overseas cotton market, stable exchange rates, and a fall in gold prices. The actual sales of spot cotton in the market felt increasingly deserted. The needs of various factories were very sluggish, so people's hearts became depressed. However, buyers in Shanghai are still holding on tightly.</p>
<p>"Han Biao" (Hankou Standard) Falls Six or Seven Qian: The "Han Biao" market opened this morning with the idea that American cotton was sluggish and people's sentiments were loose. In the second and third rounds, the yarn market rebounded and was firm. As a result, each fell two or four qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price was falling, which made people's hearts even more tired. Each fell three or four qian. The transaction volume was 56,900 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 3,900 dan, Shenda 4,100 dan, Yiyu 1,100 dan, Tianlong 1,800 dan, and Yiyu 1,900 dan. Riyu bought 2,000 dan, Yicheng 3,100 dan, Xincheng 2,500 dan, Changfeng 2,400 dan, and Xiesheng 1,200 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Haiti Tip: 40.00, Additionally, 200 bales, spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton: Mostly Weak, Few Gains</h3>
<p>American Cotton Reports Further Downstream: Yesterday, American cotton was first weak due to unfavorable Liverpool news, and then due to mass selling and a sluggish Wall Street, the market situation became softer. Futures fell seventeen to twenty-three points, and spot goods fell twenty points. British cotton futures fell one point, and spot goods rose five points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose five points. Indian cotton was firm due to the higher opening price in Liverpool. Both the near-term and far-term of Pinggouer and Bairoxi rose three rupees, and Aomula rose one rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (23rd telegram):</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Market's Downturn Intensifies Again</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the source of goods from various groups were over 30 firms, and sales were in a slump. High-quality white japonica rice was still acceptable for retail sales, but decreased by about one jiao. However, the decline in japonica rice of middle and lower quality was sharp, and there were few inquiries, so it fell by as much as two or three jiao. The selling of Bo Rice was not good, around two jiao for both large and small quantities. The market situation of Yangdu rice was originally flat, but followed the japonica market in a sharp decline, by a small jiao. General Bian Yinyuan rice was sluggish and difficult to sell, and the price was also slightly lower.</p>
<p>Hunan: Yesterday, over 20 boats arrived on the road, and the sales market in this street was extremely weak. The selling of Changbang white japonica rice was not smooth, and the market fell slightly. Su Tong japonica rice was also consistently sluggish. The japonica rice market here also showed a sharp downward trend. The arrival and sales of Nanlu Bo Rice and early rice were mediocre in terms of intent from various parties. The market atmosphere for this product was weak. The situation of Yangdujian and Bian Yinyuan was still sluggish, and the sales channel was not smooth. Prices were high to start, but then fell.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Digestion Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market situation was even more stagnant. Only train shipments were still arriving, and other shipments were difficult to transport. However, Wuhu rice was not yet banned in that area, and the market price has been decreasing recently, which has gradually made it worthwhile. However, because merchants in Shanghai had not traded Ke Xian rice for a long time, they did not dare to make inquiries. Only Zhejiang merchants and sporadic retail customers directly tried to sell. The market had no sales. Yesterday, the main Ke Xian rice sales were weak. The only sale in the city was 200 bags of Nanjing rice by this street office, priced at 9 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen to 9 yuan 8 jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Show a Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a downward trend. The quotations for foreign wheat in both Chicago and Canada were generally lower by five, six, or even eight jiao. Therefore, the slightly stable situation was impacted. Fortunately, the gold price was still stable, and large factories were also watching before dumping goods. Therefore, although each month was trending downwards, the decline was not very large. However, the lowest price for June even reached one liang nine qian eight fen seven li, which can be said to be a new record recently. As a result, this month was down one fen from the previous day, April was down one fen, May was down one and a half fen, June was down five li, July was down two and a half li, and August was down seven and a half li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Weak in the Morning, Firm in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a weak initial trend followed by firmness. In the morning, due to the small quotations for foreign wheat, most people were unanimously looking downwards, so the lowest prices for each month were two, three, or four fen lower than the previous day. By the afternoon, the buying momentum from mainland groups was strong again, and general empty positions took the opportunity to scramble to cover, causing near-term and far-term to see a rebound. Observing this kind of return, it is feared that it is only a temporary reversal, and the future trend is still difficult to be optimistic about. As a result, this month was up one fen from the previous day, April was unchanged, May was up one fen, June was unchanged, and July and August were up one fen.</p>
<h3>Standard Soybeans See a Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean futures market was not good. The selling momentum in the morning and afternoon was quite strong. The continuous weak telegrams from Dalian, and the long positions were selling heavily, and the buying appetite of various groups was weak. Most mainland groups were watching, so the market prices for each month were consistently downstream. As a result, the March and April contracts were down three fen, and the May and June contracts were down four fen.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods: Glutinous Rice Branch Number Slightly Reduced</h3>
<p>Not many glutinous rice branches have arrived recently. At first, due to cost reasons, the number of vendors was unwilling to sell cheaply. The previous high Zhuang had opened at ninety-two taels. However, now the sales appetite is very subtle, so the branch number has gradually accommodated. Yesterday, it was heard that ordinary goods opened at eighty-eight taels, which was slightly looser than before, and the market also saw a slight decrease. Yesterday, good quality goods sold for ninety-two taels, and ordinary Zhuang goods sold for ninety taels. The market situation was flat.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sand White Plummeting More Than a Qian</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegram: Cuban spot sugar unchanged, New York sugar futures March price rose four points compared to the previous telegram, and other months also rose five points each. Java spot and futures sugar had no ups or downs. The association market divided the market. The Dutch sugar No. 24 raw sand white, with the relaxation of foreign exchange, the mood turned flat, and quite a few households were selling. The initial call was ten taels and four qian, the receiving hand was silent, and then down to ten taels and three and a half qian with slight transactions. Later in the market to ten taels and three qian, the market shape gradually felt firm and stable. No. 18 medium sand white nine taels eight qian half, the trend is also flat. The Nissin sugar transaction was also very sparse. The N price was ten taels two qian two and a half fen, TM mark nine taels eight qian, YT mark ten taels one qian half, YP mark ten taels four qian, the market image was flat and tired, and the branch disk transaction was very quiet. A large bag of this factory's Bing Maochang Branch sold for thirteen taels, and there were still few inquiries. The arrival of domestic Huanggangqing has turned to surging, and the branch plate has loosened, but the digestion is very slow, and it has a sign of sluggishness.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Factory Business to Europe More Difficult to Develop</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai foreign firm silk market became more sluggish. European and American raw silk factory business was still sluggish, and prices were trending downwards. There were no Shanghai-bound Chinese silk telegrams yesterday morning. European firms' purchasing appetite was silent. Yesterday, only Hulin brought in Shanghai white factory warp silk ten packages, Weicheng brought in yellow factory warp silk fifteen packages, Samsung brought in white dry warp silk fifteen packages, and prices were flat.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Huisi Iron Sells Smoothly</h3>
<p>Huayuan Lead Wire Prices Fall to Seek Sales</p>
<p>Two hundred pound Huisi iron transactions have recently become active again. Such as the Yangtze River, inland rivers, and Tianjin gangs all have some point decoration, and the appetite of the factories in this street is especially strong, so the market goods have a situation where supply cannot meet demand, and the standard also has a tendency to rise sharply. Such as the old steel factory goods opened at thirty-two taels two qian half, new steel factory goods thirty-two taels. According to yesterday's opening, there were one thousand three or four hundred boxes.</p>
<p>Huayuan lead wire has been arriving continuously for days, and the market goods are very full. Due to the tranquility of the times, various gangs rarely pointed and dyed, so the supply exceeds the demand, and the standard has suddenly become cheaper. However, yesterday's asking price was as low as four taels five qian, but there was still no buyer.</p>

<p>In recent years, tragic news of men and women committing suicide has become more and more common in cities. The reason for this is that men are more likely to commit suicide due to life problems, and women are more likely to commit suicide due to love problems. Those with short vision mistake the right path. The world is in turmoil, which is truly sad. Yesterday I read Free Talk. I deeply admire Tao Lingjun's use of Meng Zhuang's words to ridicule. Meng Zhuang's words say: "The great earth carries me with form. It exhausts me with life. It relaxes me with old age and rests me with death. One who cherishes my life, therefore cherishes my death." Those who avoid a life of toil and rush towards an unkind death are said to be defying fate. In the world, who has a more thorough view of life than Zhuang Sheng? The Buddha said: "Understand life and death." Say "Great liberation." Now, if you are defeated by food and clothing, intoxicated by love, and laughing with a knife, a few feet of white silk, how can you achieve what is called understanding life and death and great liberation? Now, let's discuss the suicide of women. In the past, women committed suicide either to protect the loyalty of their family or to preserve their own integrity. Now, they often commit suicide after losing their chastity. This is the first difference. Thirty years ago, women held the principle of "follow the chicken and follow the chicken" (i.e., follow their husbands). In the village schools, there were many happy families. If they were unfortunately widowed and guarded themselves, they would embroider Buddha images all their lives. In the past twenty years, the customs of the world have gradually changed. Unfortunately, women often spend their boring years running schools. There was still no word of suicide. This is the second difference. In the seventh year of the Republic, I taught in a certain girls' school in Yongshang. My colleague, Ms. Wang, came from Hangzhou with a son and a daughter. Her character and learning were excellent. The students were as close to her as a nanny. Wang also loved the students as if they were her own children. I vaguely heard that Ms. Wang's life experience was quite tragic. Her husband was also from an official family, and he was constantly pursuing pleasure, treating Ms. Wang as a stranger. Over time, life became difficult. With the introduction of a certain Mr., she took her children to Yong to teach in order to make a living. So there were often tears in her eyes. Later, the person in charge of the school listened to the slanderers and said that the school's expenses were stretched. It was said that one teacher supported three mouths, which might not be affordable. After the summer vacation, the excuse was used to dismiss her. How could the elementary school students know? Suddenly hearing this news, some sighed, and some wailed. Ms. Wang smiled bitterly and comforted them before they dispersed. The next day, the students launched a farewell party. I was in the audience. I heard Ms. Wang's reply, which was tactful and appropriate, and quite impressive. At the end, she asked the students to send her a gift. While everyone was guessing, Ms. Wang calmly said: "The gift is nothing else, but I hope that all the little sisters and little brothers will send me a funeral couplet." At that moment, the sound of wailing filled the room again. I couldn't bear to hear it, so I left my seat and went out. This was fourteen years ago. The sound of children wailing is still in my ears. I don't know if Ms. Wang is still alive. If we use today's people's easiness to commit suicide, then Ms. Wang could have died more than once. As Zhuang Sheng said, "Exhaust me with life," Ms. Wang can be said to have been exhausted. Alas, the new tide is surging, and the defenses of propriety have collapsed. Such suicides are not worth regretting. Although today's parents should not wear the old-fashioned glasses of the past. This is possible.</p>
<h3>Examination of Baodu Fortress</h3>
<p>—Yingchuan Qiushui</p>
<p>There are four mountains named Baodu. One is in the southeast of Lushi County, Henan. The second is in the southeast of Huguan County, Shanxi. The third is in the west of today's Huolu County, Hebei. The fourth is in the north of Yi County, Shandong, also known as Baodu Fortress. Except for Baodu Mountain in Lushi, there is nothing different to hear. Baodu Mountain in Huguan has the story of Ji Kang entering the stone chamber to find Su Shu. Baodu Mountain in Huolu has the ancient site of the four characters "Baodu Blessed Land" inscribed in stone. Baodu Mountain in Yi County, Shandong, is also known as Jun Mountain. According to the Yuanhe Prefectural Records, the mountain is a sheer cliff of thousands of feet, and the top is wide with water. (The water is called Xijia, flowing southeast into Pizhou County, Jiangsu, and joining Dongjia, and then flowing south into the Grand Canal). In the past, hermits held a calf on top of it to cultivate it, hence the name. And Baopuzi also said that sesame grass grows on it. From this, the so-called Baodu Fortress, although not a celestial paradise, is also a fertile field. But now it has been reduced to a bandit's den. Is this the reason why the government intends to set up a county there?</p>
<h3>News from the National Traditional Chinese Medicine Conference in the Capital</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>The way of medicine lies in seeking what is suitable for the patient's body and mind, so that suffering can be alleviated as soon as possible. It should not matter whether it is traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine, Chinese medicine, or Western medicine. However, nowadays, Chinese people admire the West in all aspects. Even in treating illnesses and taking medicine, most people consult Western doctors and prescribe "medicine water" to appear modern, deeply believing in its rapid treatment. This almost disregards traditional Chinese medicine, leading to disputes between the Chinese and Western medical fields. Furthermore, some citizens even advocate abolishing traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine. Therefore, the Chinese medical professions feel increasingly resentful and panicked. Although Western medicine and Western drugs mostly follow scientific methods, our country's medicine has a history of thousands of years and its own profound knowledge and experience that should not be eliminated or abandoned. In view of this, the national government specially convened representatives from the national traditional Chinese medicine fields from various provinces and cities to hold a preparatory meeting for the National Medical Research Association from the 13th to the 17th in the National Martial Arts Hall in the capital. Nearly three hundred representatives from various provinces and cities across the country attended. The Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan of the National Government sent representatives to the meeting to give speeches, advocating for the preservation of traditional Chinese medicine to preserve the national essence. They also deeply hoped that the domestic medical community would conduct more in-depth research on medical theories and drugs in the future and be careful in treating illnesses and prescribing medicine. Then, they will be able to "bring about success" and naturally restore the idea that patients happily seek traditional Chinese medicine and use Chinese medicine. It can be said that the encouragement was very thorough. Subsequently, the representatives submitted more than fifty proposals on medical research for discussion and first resolved to establish seven departments, including a health group and a research group, to facilitate the early establishment of the general assembly, to seek happiness for the national public and to win glory for the national Chinese medicine community. During this visit of the representatives to Beijing, groups such as the Central National Martial Arts Hall, the Central National Medicine Hall, the Nanjing National Medicine Association, and the Nanjing National Medicine Association hosted banquets on different days. When the representatives were about to leave, they also hosted banquets in return. Guests and hosts enjoyed themselves, making it a grand occasion for a time.</p>
<h3>On Rats</h3>
<p>— Jian Fu</p>
<p>Rats are creatures that do more harm than good to humans. However, they rank first in the twelve zodiac signs, and for this reason, rats have become indispensable to the human world. The ancients had profound intentions and often compared rats to people. For example, calling a person ugly is "rat-eyed", calling a person indecisive is "hesitating like a rat", calling a person selfish is "rat-like theft", and calling a person who flees is "scuttling like a rat." This is common knowledge. In the Annals of Yanzi, Duke Jing asked Yanzi, "What worries are there in governing a country?" Yanzi replied, "Those are altar rats, they cannot be smoked out, they cannot be drowned, they are the king's close associates, who sell the weather for their own gain. This is what we call altar rats." In the Records of the Grand Historian, when Li Si was young, he was a clerk in his hometown. He saw rats in the clerk's toilet eating unclean things, often startled by people and dogs. He went to the granary and saw rats eating accumulated grain, living in large halls, without fear of people or dogs. He sighed and said, "Whether people are virtuous or unworthy is like rats, depending on where they are." This also uses rats to symbolize people. However, I think that calling a person's selfish actions "rat-like theft" and calling a person's escape "scuttling like a rat" are particularly accurate. Rats are good at stealing and rely on their ability to scuttle away. Let me give an example to prove this. I usually like to eat chicken eggs. One day, I bought five fresh chicken eggs and placed them on the side of my desk before going to bed. The next morning, when I went to take them, they were gone. I thought it was strange. So I bought a few more eggs and put them in the same place to observe the oddity. After a while, I saw more than a dozen rats gathered on the desk. One rat used its four feet to hold an egg, lying on its back on the desk, looking like a hedgehog. Another rat tightly bit its tail, pulling it down. The other rats took turns biting each other's tails, descending in a line. When they reached the ground, they dragged the egg into the hole and left. This happened several times. I saw an opportunity and rushed forward to catch them, killing one rat. The others all fled. Then I realized that the five eggs from last night had gone into the rats' bellies. The rats' stealing skills are so good, isn't that beyond people's expectations? Therefore, how many high-ranking officials in the world who learn the tricks of rat theft will not scuttle away? I am writing an essay about the rats, to expound it.</p>
<p>▲Short News A Changming Art School. Achievements are outstanding, and the reputation has long been established. Yesterday I visited with a friend. I saw that the school paid special attention to traditional Chinese painting. There are several eight-foot-high glass cabinets in the classroom, in which masterpieces of Wen Wufeng, Dong Huating, Bada Shanren, etc. are hanging for students to refer to. And among the students, I saw one who was very old with white hair. When I stepped back and asked the professor of the school, I learned that he was Liu Wei from Jingjiang County, who painted figures, flowers, and birds with a solid foundation. He started studying in this semester. He is so eager to learn, he is really a stream of Laoquan, and it is also an interesting story in the Shanghai academic community.</p>
<p>▲Publishing News The Saturday Weekly, which has always been known for its beauty, has been published for eight years. The 400th issue commemorative issue was published the day before yesterday. It contains famous works by Mr. Du He, Shou Juan, Zhuo Dai, Ding Song, and Pan Kuang Zhuan Tao. The photo illustrations are especially rich in aesthetics, making it a unique style in current publications. It is said that the third series of compilations is already in the process of binding and will be available for sale soon.</p>

<h3>Fan Fanshan and Chunke's Diary</h3>
<p>— Man Yin</p>
<p>Fan Fanshan passed away in Beiping. Another old Chinese literary figure has fallen. Last time, it was falsely rumored that Fan had passed away, and a eulogy couplet was written for publication in the newspaper. Later, it was known that it was a rumor about the Su Dongpo overseas. About a month ago, Fan fell on the carriage while visiting a friend. He was helped up, but he immediately showed signs of dizziness. Some say that Fan was thin and not because of this fall. However, the elderly should avoid falling. After Fan's death, one thing is most regrettable. Li Chunke's diary (namely Yue Mantang's diary), in addition to most of it printed by the Commercial Press, there are still eight large volumes in Fan Fanshan's place. When Li Chunke's diary was copied at that time, everyone contributed money, and Zhang Daishan contributed the most, up to 10,000 yuan. However, Fan Fanshan refused to hand over these eight volumes. Later, Daishan asked him for it, and Cai Zimin asked him for it, but he always responded casually and refused to hand it over. It is said that these eight volumes contain the most criticism of Fan Fanshan, not only criticizing his poetry and literary works but also his character. When we read Yue Mantang's diary, at first we thought that Chunke, Zhang Xiangtao, and Fan Zengxiang were all good friends. Later, due to disagreements, Chunke scolded Zhang Xiangtao. And in these eight volumes, Fan Fanshan was also scolded. However, the anecdotes and allusions of the past can be seen occasionally. Only in Chunke's diary, one or two can be seen more often. There are more discussions and demeanor, which are popular among those who seek modern history. Therefore, people repeatedly asked for it, but he refused to give it to them. Some say that Fan Fanshan had already burned it before his death. I once heard someone advise him: "Even if there are criticisms of you, you can black them out." Looking at Yue Mantang's diary, there are also many places blacked out. But Fan Fanshan didn't understand.</p>
<h3>Travels in India (4)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the 22nd, Scmdia Steamer Co. Mchta and I went to the Indian Chamber of Commerce and the University Tea Party. There were many people there. A reporter came to visit me and talked about Islam in detail. According to him, there are 60 million Muslims in India, and their power is very strong. They are also connected to Chinese Muslims. The power of West Asia is worthy of attention. The British controlled India from the hands of Muslims, and most of India has been conquered by Muslims. Muslims kill cows, and Hindus respect cows. They began to clash. Since Gandhi, they have gradually helped each other and harmonized to deal with foreign countries.</p>
<p>One of the biggest difficulties in India is the complexity of languages ​​and characters. For example, the language of Ceylon, but its reading of ancient Buddhist scriptures uses Pali. Newspapers in Bengal use Bengali. Newspapers in Bombay use the Bombay language. It is estimated that there are no less than hundreds of languages and races in India. At least twenty or thirty kinds of characters are currently in use. Therefore, the unification movement is very difficult. Fortunately, English is the official language. Indians are happy to use English when they meet each other. If you use Indian languages, they will not understand. Just like Cantonese people meeting Fujianese, it is more convenient to use English. Originally, the British Wells had a prediction that the people who speak English and Chinese will have the hope of unifying the world in the future. Therefore, these two languages ​​account for more than 1 billion people. It means that the cause of Datong in the future will not exceed Wells' expectations. Chinese people have this qualification. And Indian languages ​​are difficult to exist. Although its culture is high, such as Bengali and Pali, Indians themselves do not use it now. It has become an ancient text, but like Greek Latin. Friends who study Indian texts often tell me the nobility of Sanskrit. But I think it is just like Greek and Latin, which can be used for scholars to study. I am very troubled by Indian names. One person has more than ten sounds. Just like the four characters of Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi in the Diamond Sutra, there are nine Sanskrit sounds. It's too stupid. It is said that there are about 70,000 British troops in India, and the Indian troops hired throughout India exceed 100,000. I asked how much their salary is per month. The answer is seventeen rupees. They are all ordinary soldiers, and there are very few officers. There are nine large provinces and several small provinces in India. They are directly under the government. In addition, there are dozens of vassal kings. The old feudal lords are called Racha, which means king. There are also French territories in British territory. For example, a small part of a city near Calcutta is called Chandarnagar, with only a few thousand people. Just a small city. It is still French territory. It is also a strange thing. Because France used to have a very large territory in India. After several wars, Britain took over France and replaced it. There is still a small monument left. As for the anti-British movement in India, it is very fierce now. It is not just Gandhi's faction. I occasionally checked a daily newspaper and found that there were many people throwing bombs everywhere. On the same day, national flags were removed in as many as seventeen or eight places. You can imagine.</p>

<h3>Customs Abolishes Deposit Slips</h3>
<p>Deposit slip system abolished from April 1st</p>
<p>Foreign goods stored in Shanghai are transported to Hong Kong for sale</p>
<p>Deposit slip system: For imported foreign goods, import duties must be paid. However, for foreign goods that do not have a definite owner, are shipped to Shanghai or other Chinese ports, and are prepared for sale in China, or will still need to be shipped out or transported to other countries after being sold out in the future, import duties are paid as usual when the goods are imported, and a deposit slip is issued by the customs, so that if they cannot be sold in the future, and are transported back to their home country or other ports, the import duties already paid can be recovered from the customs with this deposit slip. Customs has always had this practice.</p>
<p>Scheduled cancellation: The Shanghai Jianghai Customs took the opportunity of issuing new taxes to decide to cancel the deposit slip from April 1st. A notice was issued to inform foreign merchants that after April 1st, the deposit slip will be invalid. The import duties already paid by the cargo owners will not be refunded regardless of whether they are sold or not, even if they are returned for shipment, and the name of the deposit slip will also be abolished.</p>
<p>Imported goods transported to Hong Kong: There are many deposit slip foreign goods stored in Shanghai warehouses. After the customs issued the new regulations this time, everyone was panicked. If they are not shipped out, the taxes already paid will be confiscated, and they could not find a consignee urgently. Therefore, after consultations among the cargo owners in recent days, they took Hong Kong as a tax-free port, and had to transfer these foreign goods from Shanghai to Hong Kong for temporary storage, so as to sell them to China one after another. In the past week, the foreign goods on deposit slips shipped from Shanghai to Hong Kong, such as large barrels of tobacco leaves, large and small hardware machinery, electric fans, raisins, and foreign groceries, etc., have been transported by seventy or eighty thousand items, and there are still sixty or seventy thousand items, which will be transported out in this week. The customs duties already paid have been recovered for those that have been shipped out.</p>
<h3>Revenue of Two Railways Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Results of the price increase</p>
<p>Since the Jinghu-Hangyong Railways implemented price increases for both passenger and freight transportation from the 16th of this month, the operating income has increased significantly. In the past, when the income of the Jinghu Railway was at its best, it was about 30,000 yuan per day. After the price increase was implemented, the average daily income reached more than 40,000 yuan. The daily income of the Huhang Railway also had more than 20,000 yuan, an increase of one-third compared to before. According to the current situation, it is estimated that the income of the Jinghu Railway this year can reach more than 15 million yuan, and the Huhang Railway can reach more than 8 million yuan, which will break the best operating results of the two railways in history. Therefore, if there are no other expenses for the economic situation of the railway this year, there will be a large surplus.</p>
<h3>Jin Liyuan Case Causes Diplomatic Issues</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting negotiates with the French ambassador in Beijing</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong expresses his intention to protect historical rights</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, has recovered from his sick leave and returned to the bureau to take charge of affairs as usual the day before yesterday. He also attended the memorial week of the General Manager and made a report. The summary is as follows: (1) Since I came here prepared to reorganize the bureau, from a personal point of view, except for my own opinions and ambitions that cannot be thoroughly implemented due to obstacles, or discouraged because of this, no matter what difficulties or dangers, I will not avoid resigning. From an objective point of view, the National Government has the right to choose people for the party and the country, to promote or demote officials. Unless I am guilty of corruption or really cannot thoroughly reorganize the bureau, then based on the current policy of employing people in the National Government, it does not seem likely to be easily changed. Therefore, since taking office, I have never diminished the courage to move forward. All the rumors are unfounded. (2) Part of No. 69 on the registration of Jin Liyuan Wharf was previously involved in a lawsuit because San De Tang made excuses to stop the lease. In order to take care of the Sino-French friendship and respect the opinions of the mediator, the French Consul General Ganggelin and Mr. Du Yuesheng, the bureau offered 200,000 taels to purchase it. Unexpectedly, San De Tang took advantage of the scarcity and insisted on the original price of 390,000 taels, which was twice the estimated price. However, the bureau still followed the original principle of peaceful settlement, hoping that both parties would settle the case peacefully. A few days ago, the bureau officially sent lawyer Gao Shuo to negotiate with San De Tang. Unexpectedly, Father Xiaqi, who flaunts the mission of spreading the truth and love, was recklessly rude and arrogant. Now he has sent a letter stating that he is withdrawing the original letter asking for a price last year, disregarding good faith and reneging on his previous words, which is almost childish. It is verified that the original price of this land was filled by the bureau. The Qing government, accommodating diplomacy, ceded it to the church. However, the deed clearly stated that it was leased to the bureau and could not be leased to others. Otherwise, the deed would be void, and it was stated in the correspondence that if the China Merchants Bureau wanted to buy it back, San De Tang would not be allowed to hoard and other statements. It is very clear that the bureau exchanged the ownership of the land for a perpetual lease, and it cannot be denied. Now the church is disregarding history and good faith, and intends to provoke trouble. The bureau is justified and will never allow it to destroy the national shipping industry and act arbitrarily. This matter will cause a diplomatic problem and will argue with it based on reason.</p>
<p>According to another report, it is said that the China Merchants Bureau has sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Foreign Minister Wang will negotiate with the French envoy in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Discharged from Orthopedic Hospital Yesterday</h3>
<p>Still need to recuperate carefully and temporarily not seeing guests</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, has been in the orthopedic hospital for three months since he was injured. After several surgeries performed by doctors, his right foot has been able to move slightly. However, getting up, sitting, turning, and moving are still not very easy. Xiong felt bored after living in the hospital for a long time. Yesterday morning, the weather was clear, so he ordered a car to be prepared and went on a suburban tour. Later, he passed the private residence on Albert Road and went in to rest. His family sat around and talked quietly, and his daughters circled his knees and pulled his clothes. Xiong did not want to return to the hospital. It is said that the doctor in the hospital still visits once a day and has two nurses taking care of him, strictly prohibiting him from seeing guests and talking too much, so that he can recover completely as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchants' Delegation from Dutch East Indies Returns to China</h3>
<p>A total of twelve members</p>
<p>Departing from Batavia today</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China received a letter from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, yesterday, stating: Dear Sirs, the current time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap is a great opportunity to develop Sino-South business. Therefore, at the suggestion of our chamber of commerce, we organized a Chinese Overseas Chinese Business Delegation from the Dutch East Indies to return to China to investigate commercial products. Since its establishment, the time has been short. However, those who have signed up to participate are very enthusiastic, which shows the enthusiasm of our overseas Chinese in caring for the motherland. In addition to the members who have signed up, which will be listed separately, the first group is scheduled to return to China from Batavia on March 25. They plan to travel and investigate in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, Beiping, Liaoning, Dalian, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, etc., and then return to Shanghai. However, due to the unfamiliarity of people and places, and the disconnection of situations, we should first send a letter to your chamber of commerce. Once the delegation arrives, we hope to receive assistance and guidance to facilitate the proceedings. The list of members of the delegation is as follows: Zhang Ming (Consul General in Java), Zhuang Xiyan (General Manager of Batavia Quanmei Company, Chairman of Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce), Chen Bingding (General Manager of Batavia Shunmeicheng Company), Lan Qiujin (General Manager of Chengmei Company), Chen Zehai, Yang Rongzhou, Lin Deyi, Wang Bingquan, Chen Quequan, Chen Renyi, Yang Chunmei, Huang Yongdian, etc.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Expand Shipping Business to China</h3>
<p>Alliance: Japan Mail Steamship Company and Osaka Shosen Kaisha are the largest shipping companies in Japan, and their business in China is also the largest. In the past, the two companies each had their own policies for shipping to China, and the competition was fierce. Last year, it was difficult for the two companies to make profits in shipping to China. Now, the presidents of the two companies have agreed on a public alliance for business in China. The two companies have changed their competitive attitude in shipping to a cooperative alliance. Freight and passenger fares are all jointly handled. Facing non-Japanese ships, they will increase competition.</p>
<p>Increase in shipping: There are no Yantai liners in Shanghai. Recently, Dalian Steamship Company, seeing that the Shanghai-Yantai cargo transportation of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson is very developed, decided to join the competition. The company's Shanghai-Tianjin liners Changping Maru and Tianjin Maru have been assigned to also serve Zhifu and are asking Yantai to help them solicit export cargo in order to compete fiercely with British ships.</p>
<h3>Permitted Groups Allowed to Participate in National Elections</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: To notify you, according to the official letter No. 32 from the Shanghai Municipal Election Office for National Assembly Representatives, it has been approved by the Municipal Government to forward the Yuan telegram from the Ministry of Industry, which states: To the provincial and municipal governments, since the National Assembly election is imminent, there are still some people's organizations that have been permitted to establish by the local senior party headquarters, but have not been approved and filed by the Ministry due to the time required for official documents to be processed. Now, in order to facilitate the election administration, it is specifically determined that all organizations that have been recognized by the local party headquarters as having sound organization and have a permit certificate are allowed to participate in the National Assembly election first, and should still be ordered to submit an application for approval and filing according to law. A special telegram is sent to you for investigation and forwarding to the relevant departments and bureaus for notification. The Ministry of Industry, Yuan Yin, etc., is hereby approved. Accordingly, it is hereby notified to your bureau for investigation, and I hope that you will forward it to all subordinate groups for notification. This order.</p>
<h3>寶山湄浦河繼續開工</h3>
<p>Yesterday's River Works Conference</p>
<p>The Meipu River in Baoshan County, measuring twelve Chinese miles in length, is one of the county's most important waterways. Due to increasing siltation, the Construction Bureau and the First District initiated dredging, establishing a River Works Committee to oversee the project. Work commenced on December 3rd of last year but was suspended due to continuous rain and snow. Since Director Wu assumed office, recognizing the crucial relationship between river ports and farmland irrigation, he dispatched personnel on the 20th of this month for an on-site inspection. He also ordered the contractor to resume work on the 23rd. It is said that if the weather remains favorable, the project could be completed by early next month. Furthermore, the River Works Committee held its tenth meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM. Attendees included Committee members Wu Wenhua, Wang Yuming, Tao Qingfeng, and over ten others. The chairman delivered a report, followed by the resolution of four significant cases, as follows: (1) After the rain and snow last winter, soil on both banks of the Meipu River collapsed, and there was significant water accumulation in the river, increasing the earthwork by approximately 1,000 cubic feet and the water removal cost by about 300 yuan, exceeding the original budget significantly. How should this be remedied? It was resolved that (A) the increased earthwork would still be compensated at the original rate of thirty cents of a silver dollar per cubic foot, (B) the increased water removal cost would be compensated with an additional ten cents of a silver dollar per unit of measurement, and an additional sixty yuan would be approved for water drainage at Kaihuilong. (2) Committee member Gui proposed to immediately request the fourth installment of earthwork expenses, amounting to 2,000 yuan, and an additional 500 yuan for cart dams and miscellaneous expenses, from the Finance Department for approval. It was resolved to approve the proposal. (3) Should the damage caused by the rain and snow last winter and the excess of the Meipu River's budget be reported to the county government for record-keeping? It was resolved to report to the county government for record-keeping. (4) Regarding the setting of a completion date, it was resolved that the committee would notify the Engineering Department to ensure completion by April 5th.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce to Convene Representatives from All Industries Today</h3>
<p>Discussing Methods to Promote the New Weights and Measures System</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in accordance with the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, has prepared for the implementation of the new weights and measures system in the city. Upon receiving the order from the Ministry of Industry, it was approved to complete the unification by July 1st of this year. In addition, the manufacturing shops in the city were ordered to start making new equipment and prohibit the making of old equipment from February 15th. The new system will be piloted in all city vegetable markets starting May 1st. With the unification date approaching, the Chamber of Commerce, as the leader of all industries, should assist the government in urging the progress and unifying on schedule. However, the matter is a pioneering initiative, and the circumstances of each industry are different. Therefore, it has been decided to convene representatives from all industries at the Chamber's auditorium at 2:00 PM on the 25th to thoroughly discuss methods for promoting the system. The Chamber has sent circulars to all guilds, expecting representatives to attend at that time.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Daji Steamer Disaster Under Discussion</h3>
<p>Rebuilding a New Steamer Within Five Months</p>
<p>Since the Dada Company's Daji steamer was wrecked at Longjiao Port, details have been widely reported in the newspapers. Currently, the company's board of directors is focused on the settlement of the aftermath, concerning the families of the victims, related businesses, and the general public. The Guowen News Agency reporter has compiled the following information from yesterday's sources:</p>
<p>Aftermath Issues: For the crew, servants, and drowned passengers of the Daji steamer disaster, the company first registered the families. The detailed list has been published in the Shanghai newspapers. In the past two days, no more families have registered. However, some families in the Jiangbei area who were affected have not yet arrived to register. The investigation and processing are ongoing. Recently, the company convened a board of directors meeting to discuss the aftermath and response. The board is formulating specific methods for compensating the families of the deceased crew members, servants, and victims. The company has forwarded the detailed quantities of goods transported by various merchants in Jiangbei to the Shipping Association. The association will adjudicate the compensation matters and then notify the Dada Company to resolve the matter through bilateral discussions.</p>
<p>Daji to Be Rebuilt: The entire cabin and outer hull of the Daji steamer were completely burned. Only the bottom layer of the ship and the engine remain. It was towed back to Shanghai on the 18th and is currently docked along the river near the Ruitong Shipyard in Yangshupu. The Daji was built by Ruitong in 1924 at a cost of 270,000 taels. It was 21 zhang long and had a carrying capacity of 800 tons. It is reported that the company will rebuild the Daji within five months to supplement the flight schedule. Bidding for labor will begin next month. It is said that the Jiangnan Shipyard and Ruitong Shipyard have sent people to estimate the materials needed for the Daji.</p>
<h3>Postal Authorities Collecting Income Tax</h3>
<p>Paying According to Regulations Starting This Month</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation recently issued an order to the Shanghai Postal General Bureau, which serves postmasters, postal clerks, and staff of post offices nationwide, to collect income tax from March onwards in accordance with the regulations of the Central Party Department's Income Tax Collection Ordinance. The bureau will issue a circular to all post offices nationwide to comply. Postal staff in Shanghai have received this notice and will pay according to regulations at the end of this month. However, mail carriers and laborers are not subject to this. The tax rate standard is as follows: for administrative personnel and postal staff with salaries ranging from 50 to 100 yuan, 1% will be collected; from 101 to 200 yuan, 2% will be collected; from 201 to 300 yuan, 3% will be collected; and so on.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Supplementary Native Cloth Tax</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Tax Department yesterday regarding the supplementary native cloth tax issue, stating, "Respectfully, on the 20th of this month, we received a letter from the local native cloth industry association stating that when tax-exempt native cloth was reported for export, the customs required certificates of unified tax payment. Regarding this, the association had previously explained in detail that in addition to the approval, there are no other documents that can be certified with the goods after the tax-exempt native cloth. Moreover, the thousands of weaving households are scattered in rural areas, and their purchasing power is only enough for a small package of yarn (weighing nine jin). Therefore, the unified tax payment certificate is impossible to obtain through indirect means. The letter requested your department to provide certification and forward it to the Unified Tax Bureau of the Unified Tax Administration for verification and processing. Subsequently, export permits were issued, and the customs allowed the shipment to proceed. Our industry deals in old-style handmade native cloth, which has long been tax-exempt. According to the Regulations on the Collection of Unified Taxes promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, they are entirely products directly woven after the unified tax has been paid. Our association has already submitted separate reports to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, requesting notification. However, the customs' tax collection is still following the old regulations and collecting taxes accordingly. Therefore, we reiterate the previous situation and are now instructing the association to pay the customs duties based on the transportation permits issued to various merchants by the Unified Tax Bureau. However, according to the Regulations on the Collection of Unified Taxes, the export of this native cloth should not be taxed again, and it is not an unreasonable request from the association. Currently, we hope that the authorities will consider the speed of transit, which affects the market, and allow exemption from collection. The association still hopes that the authorities will consistently protect the association. The association faces immense difficulties. Therefore, we request you to forward this letter to the Jianghai Tax Department and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau to strongly present the association's difficulties and grant exemption from supplementary payments. If there are any difficulties in the procedures of the Tax Bureau, then the previously exempted and the previously collected taxes should not be discussed again. With April 1st approaching, if it can be maintained, it will come from the authorities' consideration." According to the meeting, the tax exemption for native cloth is a continuation of the case from the seventh year of the Republic of China, which has always inquired whether it is handmade and meets the six standards set by the Ministry. After the promulgation of this unified tax regulation, the customs will verify and release the exported cloth by checking whether there is a certificate of unified tax payment. However, the weaving households for handmade native cloth are scattered in rural areas, and the yarn is also purchased piecemeal. It is difficult to separately collect and present the certificates of unified tax payment. Our association reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance and the Customs Administration on March 21, requesting a separate tax-exempt transportation permit to be issued for customs clearance. The temporary certificate given by the Unified Tax Administration to native cloth merchants is similar in nature to the tax-exempt transportation permit requested by our association. It is said that from the 9th to the 17th of this month, the temporary certificates issued for each batch of exported native cloth have been exempted from tax by your department. Suddenly ordering supplementary payments this time, we do not know the basis for the reason. According to the letter, we should correspond with your tax department to see if the issue of supplementary taxes can be resolved after the issue of tax-exempt certificates is approved and then handled together. Sincerely, for the sake of public relations."</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reports: A reporter met with an official from the city government yesterday, who stated that the city government acquired over 5,000 mu of land in the city center area in previous years. Currently, the construction of the city center area is progressing rapidly, and there is a growing sense that the land already acquired is insufficient. Therefore, there are plans to expand the scope and continue acquiring land. It is said that this time, the focus will be on areas along the banks of the river.

<h3>Japanese Inspection Team to Visit China</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai on the Second of Next Month; In recent years, due to the global economic downturn, foreign trade in various countries has been greatly affected. As China's production is backward and demand has increased, the surplus goods of various countries are transported to China for sales. The United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and other countries have sent personnel to China for inspections, the purpose of which is nothing more than commercial competition. Japan has recently sent personnel to China for inspections. It is now learned that the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry will also send personnel to China for inspections, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the second of next month. It is heard that they will establish a factory in China. (New Sound Press)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Orders Bureau of Social Affairs to Handle the Sanxin Yarn Factory Sale</h3>
<p>Rong Zongjing Sends Telegram to Ministry of Industry Stating Machinery, Factories All Purchased; Labor Representatives Request Relief and Return of the Tongshantang Property</p>
<p>The Sanxin Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road has announced the sale of its machinery and factories, which have been purchased by the prominent businessman Rong Zongjing. He sent personnel to take over, but the entire staff demanded that the aftermath be settled first and refused to hand over, so it was not implemented. Rong sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industry requesting relief. The Ministry of Industry sent a telegram to the city's Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate and handle the matter. The telegram from the Ministry of Industry and the petition from the labor representatives are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from Ministry of Industry; The City Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday received a telegram from Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi, stating: "To the City Bureau of Social Affairs, Rong Shang Zongjing's telegram states: 'Shanghai's Sanxin Yarn Factory has a long history in the textile industry. The factory owes a large sum to HSBC, which sold the factory to the China Business Company, which sold it to Sassoon &amp; Co. Rong Zongjing spent 400,000 taels to buy the factory and all the machinery from the foreign company. With the textile industry in severe decline, rather than falling into foreign hands and further competing, it is better to try to buy it back and develop it gradually. Therefore, as soon as the handover procedures are completed, it is planned to start work immediately. However, the employees have repeatedly obstructed the handover, making it impossible to complete the transfer. Although the demands of the employees are not related to Zongjing, each day of delay results in losses. The Minister has a long-standing determination to protect industry and should order the Shanghai Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs to handle the matter quickly so that the factory can start work as soon as possible, which is in the public interest.' Therefore, the bureau is instructed to investigate and handle the matter and provide a response. Ministry of Industry."</p>
<p>Petition from Labor Representatives; Yesterday, the Cotton Spinning Industry Union of the Third Special District sent a document to the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating: "Regarding the sale of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, it was secretive beforehand and hasty afterward. It was neither approved by your bureau nor did it notify all workers one month in advance. The closure and sale without authorization violates the government's clear orders and deprives workers of their livelihood, which is extremely stubborn. The Sanxin Yarn Factory has been established for over forty years, and its business has always been good. Its capital has increased from 800,000 to 4.5 million. The inside story of this sale is self-evident. The factory owner only seeks private gain and disregards the lives of the workers, which is deplorable. Now that the matter is a foregone conclusion, it is necessary to settle the aftermath and prevent our four thousand workers from perishing. This time, the factory has violated the Provisional Measures for Retirement Treatment of Employees. We are submitting two copies of the register with all workers' monthly wages and years of service calculated according to law, and we request your bureau to order the factory owner to pay them immediately. Moreover, the factory has been open for quite some time, and the workers have made no small contributions to the factory owner. Therefore, elderly and infirm workers who have no place to seek a livelihood, in addition to requesting retirement pay, must be given alimony. In addition, the Tongshantang of the factory is a charitable organization for workers, and its funds and operating expenses are all donated by employees and workers, and it has accumulated considerable savings over the years. Now that the factory has been sold, all the property of the Tongshantang should be returned to our workers. We have jointly sent a letter to the former director Sheng Yulin, requesting the transfer, but he ignored it, bordering on embezzlement. Therefore, we are submitting this document together to your bureau, requesting that you consider the lives of the workers and expedite the matter so that it can be resolved as soon as possible and that our four thousand workers can survive, which is in the public interest. Sincerely."</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Suichuan Fellow-Villagers Association Established</h3>

<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs to Distribute Abstracts of Next Year's National Calendar</h3>
<p>Book and Printing Industries Can Obtain Them by Sending a Letter; The City Bureau of Social Affairs has been printing national calendars and new calendars for many years for various circles to use in printing calendars, monthly calendars, diaries, and daily compendiums. Although the national calendar compiled by the Ministry of Education and the bureau's new calendar are available for reference, calendars and monthly calendars are often printed in March and April, while national calendars and calendars take time to compile due to their rich content and are often published in August and September. Various circles still suffer from a lack of basis for calculation, which often leads to errors. It is a matter of current affairs and politics, which is regrettable. The Ministries of Interior and Education have ordered the Institute of Astronomy of the Academia Sinica to pre-compile two copies of the abstract of the national calendar for the twenty-first year for use. Two thousand copies have been reprinted and widely distributed to standardize them. All book and printing industries that want to print calendars, monthly calendars, etc., can request them from the fourth section of the bureau. Enclose a separate envelope in the letter, stating the name and address of the requester and affixing postage stamps, and they will be issued immediately.</p>
<h3>Citizens' United Association Opposes Estimating Rent for Donation Collection</h3>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Department; The Shanghai Special District Citizens' United Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We have learned from reports that your bureau's municipal general donation, commonly known as the patrol donation, will be collected based on estimated rent rather than actual rent, and that it has been notified that it will be implemented starting January 1 of this year, with the new amount being collected. The above matter has been reported by the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, which has sent a letter to your bureau requesting verification and cancellation of this illegal method. The facts and reasons are detailed in that letter, so there is no need for us to repeat them. However, if this illegal act is brazenly implemented, it will have a huge impact on all citizens of the district, and the citizens will inevitably rise up to deal with it. Our association is one of the legal entities in the special district and a group representing all citizens in the district. Regarding the actions of your bureau, we submitted it to the twentieth plenary meeting for discussion. It was agreed that the collection of municipal general donations should be based on the actual rent according to the housing ticket, which is the principle of municipal finance and the general practice in society. Estimation should only be applied to self-owned houses with imputed rent. If it is calculated uniformly according to estimated rent, there will be no basis for it. Once this precedent is set, the citizens will directly suffer from the pain of arbitrarily increased donation rates and indirectly contribute to the rising rent. The citizens will not recognize this additional burden. Therefore, it was resolved to send a special letter of warning to the Public Works Department, demanding that it immediately cancel this illegal method. The collection of general donations based on estimated rent violates the principle of municipal finance. Not only is it absolutely impossible to implement, but it will also leave a stain on the municipal history of the Public Concession. As a result, it will only increase the citizens' resentment towards your bureau. The citizens will definitely insist on opposing this harsh policy. Accordingly, we enclose the case and send this letter, hoping that you will investigate and immediately cancel this illegal method of collecting general donations based on estimated rent. To the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>

<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs to Thoroughly Investigate Tongji Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Workers at the Tongji Silk Weaving Factory on Tianbao Road, Hongkou, were preparing to join a legal union to alleviate their suffering. However, they were beaten by thugs, injuring worker representative Wang Peizhang. All workers believe that the factory director instigated the beating of the worker representative. Therefore, they sent representatives to the Bureau of Social Affairs the day before yesterday to petition, making four demands. Yesterday, the Silk Weaving Union of Yinxing District also sent representatives to the Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting that the factory director who sabotaged the labor movement be severely punished and that the murderers be arrested to facilitate the labor movement. It is heard that the bureau, after receiving the report, has decided to send Zhu Guilin today to thoroughly investigate the matter for verification and handling.</p>
<h3>Jinxin Labor Dispute Mediation Failed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Management Absent, Rescheduled for Tomorrow; Workers at the Jinxin Silk Weaving Factory on Poyang Road went on strike on the 21st. After the union director Sun Maoer was beaten by thugs, the public was outraged. The Bureau of Social Affairs continued mediation yesterday morning. The labor representatives arrived on time, but the management representatives did not attend, making it impossible to conduct mediation. The chairman ordered the labor representatives to return and wait for a resolution, while strictly ordering the management to mediate again at 9:00 AM on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Staff on Two Railway Lines Urge Salary Increase</h3>
<p>Staff at the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Lines urge that the year-end salary increase for the nineteenth year, which was supposed to be given starting in January of this year, has not been approved by the bureau, even though it has been four months since it was submitted. However, the accounting, mechanical, electrical, and engineering departments have already been approved and supplemented. Therefore, the union representatives and the staff of the transportation department urged the railway bureau again the day before yesterday to approve and allocate the funds as soon as possible to satisfy the public.</p>
<h3>An Appeal from the Owners of Straw Shed Rickshaws</h3>
<p>Regarding the Increase of Rickshaw Licenses</p>
<p>Representing the straw shed rickshaw pullers of the southern city area of Rihui Bridge, Ju Ganxin, Wang Dengcai, Yong Lichun, Liu Changjiang, Tang Jinshan, Zhu Xuehuai, and over twenty others, submit a petition to the Municipal Government, stating: "Regarding the matter of increasing the number of rickshaw licenses in the Chinese area, your esteemed government has already resolved to issue enough for ten thousand vehicles. Regarding the method of increasing licenses, will it be (1) issued to laborers who pull and support themselves, or (2) only to those who are requesting this time? The Public Utilities Bureau of your esteemed government is still deliberating on which method to follow. Outsiders are unaware, and rickshaw shops and blacksmiths are working day and night, with all the imported oak wood being sold out, and the price of steel plates and screws doubling and tripling. The talk on the streets suggests that those requesting this time are seen as one and the same as those who pull and support themselves. We poor citizens would not dare heed such rumors. We have heard that the inside story of this request involves unscrupulous merchants using money and influence, exploiting rickshaw pullers, and intending to disrupt business in the Chinese area. Although rumors cease with the informed, the public's voice can melt metal, and there may well be a tiger in the city. At the 155th Municipal Conference last year, it was resolved to extend the existing quota guarantee donation for another year, with the Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus formulating a fundamental improvement plan. This improvement plan should naturally be designed for the poor laborers, considering how to support rickshaw pullers and prevent monopolization by rickshaw owners. The entire construction of rickshaws in this city should be discussed jointly by social charities and other organizations, which may be beyond the capability of the Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus. The Finance Bureau's duty is to collect donations, and the Public Utilities Bureau's is to manage the vehicles. If changes are made in name only, calling it improvement when it is not, why bother with such unnecessary disturbances? Furthermore, three years ago, when the number of rickshaws in the southern part of Shanghai was reduced from 5,064 to 4,500, and in Zhabei from 3,572 to 2,900, the Public Utilities Bureau took great pains, yet still failed to gain the understanding of the rickshaw community. Now, without adding more roads or expanding the area, and with public buses being promoted daily, how is the business situation of these 7,400 rickshaws compared to three years ago? The Public Utilities Bureau, being responsible, cannot be unaware. If the intention is to increase licenses for those who pull and support themselves, then for the sake of maintaining donation collection, the existing quota should remain as before. If there are also limitations on the requests of laborers, then what will happen to those who come later? Will the vacancies be filled by others to comply with the original agreement? It is truly incomprehensible. We have paid donations for over 200 rickshaws, and there are hundreds of households that rely on pulling rickshaws to support themselves, yet we have not heard of any such proposal. Moreover, rickshaw pullers in the Chinese area have very meager incomes. With the prices of rubber, metal, and vehicle materials soaring along with gold prices, the cost of a rickshaw is no less than seventy or eighty yuan. Assuming that rickshaw pullers have this capability, whether these 2,600 licenses are issued to shed households or to owners who provide food and lodging has not been publicly announced by the Public Utilities Bureau, arousing social attention, so there cannot be no rumors. Furthermore, Rihui Bridge is a necessary route to Longhua, West Gate, and Gaochang Temple. Since the launch of public buses, most of the more than 200 rickshaws have been illegally operating in the French Concession, rushing back in the fading twilight, their earnings barely enough to eat. The wide and sparsely populated area often experiences robbery and skinning incidents. This situation and suffering are what we have been eagerly awaiting relief from, like clouds in a great drought. Now that your esteemed government has decided to increase rickshaw licenses to provide a livelihood for the poor laborers, what more can be said? We only earnestly request careful deliberation and the establishment of practical relief measures, with strict prevention against the practice of rickshaw peddlers selling short and unscrupulous merchants deliberately disrupting the trade. Also, the rent in the Concession is thirteen yuan and five jiao, while in the Chinese area it is only four jiao and five fen. Being in the same urban area, the difference is so great that there should be some adjustment and assessment to show fairness and dispel public doubts. The municipality would be fortunate, and we would be fortunate."</p>

<h3>Magistrate of Kuifu Fengjie County Begs for Relief by Telegram</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Merchants' Public Welfare Association received a telegram on behalf of the Magistrate of Fengjie County, stating: "I, (titles omitted), respectfully acknowledge that since our county was captured by bandits three times in the past few years, the spirit of the past century has been completely destroyed. The people's livelihood is in extreme poverty. Even with hard work and rest, it is difficult to recover. Last winter, we suffered a severe freeze, followed by a poor spring harvest. Last year, we had a strange drought, and the autumn harvest was also disappointing. The entire county's harvest was less than one-tenth of normal. No less than 200,000 people are starving. In recent months, the somewhat well-off families have relied on purchasing grain from outside, while the poorest villagers in the countryside can find no food in the fields. They have exhausted all the grass roots, banana stems, and tree bark. Some even dig up white sandy mud called Guanyin clay to eat, even fighting over the area. Disputes have broken out, and panic has spread. The fields are devoid of green grass, and there are starving people everywhere. Looking out over the countryside, the desolation is unbearable. Moreover, since the winter, there has been a prolonged drought without rain, and this year's spring harvest is also hopeless. In recent months, neighboring counties and upstream areas have often blocked and closed grain sales, making it difficult for even well-off families to buy grain. Reports from various villages are frequent, and robberies are difficult to prevent. Crises have broken out, and dangerous situations are occurring. This time, the disturbances by the bandits lasted for several months, and all the villages on the south bank have been reduced to ruins. The disaster is particularly severe, unprecedented and unseen. In this time of deep water and fire, with fish stranded awaiting rescue, and lacking methods to save the dying and nurture the living, if the military and government officials and people from all walks of life show great compassion and provide urgent relief, then the disaster victims in the entire county will not be forced to flee, and the lives of the wailing people will depend on it. Their deep kindness will never be forgotten. I urgently send this telegram and await good news. Tang Jiazhong, Magistrate of Fengjie County and Chairman of the Military Committee, and Li Qian, Deputy Chairman and Chief Drillmaster Chen Xun, bow. Seal."</p>
<h3>Wang Junsheng Continues to Conduct Burials in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of Pushan Villa, which has been conducting burials of the exposed corpses in the areas bordering Jiangsu and Zhejiang for the past three years, a total of 35,244 sets of skeletal remains have been collected and buried. The work has been continuous, and no effort has been spared. Director Wang Junsheng recently went to Jiaxing, Wangjiangjing, Puyuan, and other places to survey the area as Qingming Festival approaches, and also contacted the districts of Tongli, Shengze, Lili, Zhenze, Luhu, Yanmu, Pingwang, Hubin, and others in Wujiang County to commission burial work this spring. The district chiefs are all enthusiastic in carrying out their duties, which is commendable. However, there are still over 100,000 sets of skeletal remains unburied, and the expenses are very difficult. It is now deeply hoped that all great philanthropists will show compassion and generously contribute to complete this good deed.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Receives Relief Request Telegram from Henan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a telegram from the Henan Relief Committee, stating: "Mr. Wu Zhihao, President of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and all the great philanthropists in Shanghai, we are deeply grateful for the repeated letters and telegrams from Representative Li Zizhong, who has praised your concern for the Henan disaster and your determination to rescue the people in the two rivers. However, the disaster situation in Henan is extremely severe, unprecedented in history. Although we have repeatedly received relief from various parties, the disaster area is too vast, and assistance is exhausted. Currently, large numbers of starving people are traveling in groups to find food. The Longhai and Pinghan railway cars are being stormed by large crowds every day, and the number of those who die in ditches is even more difficult to count. The funds for the porridge kitchens are about to run out, and the number of deaths is increasing daily. Now is the time when the old harvest has been depleted and the new has not yet arrived, a critical moment of life and death. If we do not quickly find a solution, not only will there be corpses everywhere, greatly harming the harmony of nature, but we also fear that the starving people will gather and take risks. Reports say that the philanthropists have recently raised funds for the Shaanxi relief and have quickly collected a large amount of money. Your kindness has spread to the three Qin regions. We hope that you will treat us equally, rescue the people of Henan, and spread your benevolence to the Song and Luo regions. We send this special telegram with respect and await your kind response. Zhang Fang, Ma, Henan Relief Committee."</p>
<h3>National Exports to the United States in January</h3>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General in this city announced that in January, China's national exports to the U.S., including Hong Kong, totaled US$2,687,502, of which textiles and raw materials such as silk and wool accounted for over US$2.11 million, inedible animal products accounted for over US$326,000, and the rest were negligible, totaling just over US$200,000.</p>
<h3>Priority of Collateral Documents and Warehouse Receipts in Transferring Ownership</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Responds That There Is No Fixed Custom</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce replied to the Jiangsu High Court yesterday, stating: "We received your letter of the 7th of this month, inquiring whether, in Shanghai's business community, when warehouse receipts are used as collateral, is it customary to transfer the ownership of the warehouse receipts first and then write the collateral document, or vice versa? We have consulted with both the banking and money industries in this city. According to the banking industry, this matter depends on the credit of the other party. If they have sufficient credit, funds can be used even without transferring the warehouse receipts, which is a common occurrence. If the other party's credit is insufficient to be trusted, the warehouse receipts used as collateral should be transferred first, and then the collateral document should be issued to borrow funds. However, because the actual practices of each bank are different, there is no fixed custom. According to the money industry, when warehouse receipts are used as collateral, there is no fixed order for issuing the collateral document and transferring the ownership of the warehouse receipts. In some cases, warehouse receipts are temporarily used as collateral without issuing a collateral document, which is also effective, but must be obtained in good faith and with verifiable records. Our Chamber has verified the information provided by both industries. There is indeed no fixed custom in this city regarding the priority of issuing the collateral document and transferring the ownership of the warehouse receipts. We have prepared this letter to inform you accordingly for your reference."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Requests Correction of Business Tax Rates in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>The Highest Reaching 50 Per Thousand</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating: "We have received a letter from member Wanfeng Fertilizer Company, stating that our company's sales of German Lion and Horse brand fertilizer are very small. According to the 'List of Business Tax Rates for Goods Sales in Fujian Province' issued by the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance, the business tax for the fertilizer industry is 50 per thousand. Also, the seventh district of Haimen, Zhejiang, set the business tax rate for the fertilizer industry at 20 per thousand. According to Article 4 of the 'Outline for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces' issued by the Executive Yuan, the tax rate for those who collect tax based on turnover should not exceed 2 per thousand. Fertilizer is a necessity for agriculture, not a luxury business, and is not subject to elimination. It should be taxed at 2 per thousand or less as stipulated in the outline. Furthermore, this tax rate has not been approved by the Ministry of Finance and is clearly contrary to the law. Currently, businesses have not paid the business tax that has not been approved by the Ministry of Finance, and our company cannot be an exception. We have long admired your association as a leader of merchants and therefore specially send this letter to you, earnestly requesting your maintenance." Our Chamber has checked the previous approval from your Ministry, stating that the business tax regulations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are being reviewed, and any regulations that do not conform to the outline and supplementary measures issued by the Ministry will be corrected one by one. The business tax rates in various provinces, exceeding 10 per thousand, are virtually equivalent to collecting taxes as a percentage. Regardless of the nature of the business, it violates the outline set by the Ministry regarding taxation per thousand. The tax rate proposed by Fujian Province, reaching 50 per thousand, is even more in violation of the regulations of the Ministry. We propose that the provincial business tax regulations, whether or not they have been submitted to the Ministry for review, be investigated and corrected to avoid exceeding the scope and burdening merchants. This is a common concern. Respectfully, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>Water Patrol Cracks Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Yue Nanting Achieves Outstanding Success</p>
<p>Rescues Hostage and Arrests Three Bandits</p>
<p>Around 8 o'clock the previous evening, Yue Nanting, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team, was patrolling the river near Datong Wharf in Nanshi when he noticed three or four people standing on the wharf, looking flustered and glancing around, as if afraid of being ambushed. They huddled together in a corner, whispering and talking secretly, and then together boarded the Hongda steamer docked there. Officer Yue, suspecting that these people were acting suspiciously and were not good people, decided to board the steamer to investigate. He saw that these people were talking to another group of several passengers, observing their behavior, which was quite secretive and suspicious. He hid in a dark place and listened carefully. He heard one of the three or four people who had boarded the steamer say, "If you don't cooperate, we will throw you one by one into the Huangpu River." Officer Yue, hearing this, was greatly alarmed and was about to step forward to arrest them when he was noticed. The people quickly fled, disembarking and running away. Officer Yue immediately gave chase and managed to capture one of them. At that time, it was dark and the wharf was very crowded, so in a moment, two or three people had disappeared. The officer took the captured person, along with two passengers, a man and a woman, and a child, back to the team. During the preliminary interrogation by Chief Xu, the male passenger identified himself as Min Dayu, 46 years old, from Gaoyou. He stated that on November 11th of last year, a group of bandits suddenly came to his house and kidnapped his son, Deng Xizi. On December 12th, he found a letter stuck on the door. After opening the letter, he learned that his son had been kidnapped to Shanghai. The letter asked him to go to the Shenglou Restaurant on Fourth Ma Road in Shanghai to contact the bandits, who demanded a minimum ransom of 5,000 yuan before his son could be returned. However, because he had no savings at home, he had no way of raising such a large sum of money. Fearing that his son might be harmed, he had no choice but to quickly sell his land, raising over 2,000 yuan. He immediately accompanied his sister, Pan Min, carrying the money, to Shanghai on the 19th of this month. He asked his relative, Pan Asan, to take 290 yuan to the agreed location to contact the bandits. After a while, they changed the meeting place to a bathhouse on Pingliang Road, where he and his sister waited outside. After a long time, Pan Asan came out and said that he had handed over 290 yuan to the bandit named Qin Siyun. However, Qin said that the small amount was not enough and that over 1,000 yuan was still needed. At this point, he had no choice but to give Pan Asan another 1,200 yuan on the 22nd, asking him to contact the bandits again. Not long after, Pan Asan indeed brought his son to the Shenglou Restaurant and handed him over to them. A moment later, his sister and the son came to the South, boarding the Hongda steamer with the intention of returning home. However, the bandits came again, claiming that they needed another 210 yuan to make up the sum of 1,700 yuan. Because he told them that he had no money, the bandits tried to throw them into the Huangpu River. Fortunately, the police arrived and saved them from this disaster. The person currently detained is an accomplice of the bandits. The woman is his sister, Pan Min, and the child is his son, Deng Xizi, who was kidnapped and ransomed. When questioned, Pan Min, 31 years old, stated that Dayu was her brother and Pan Asan was her husband's cousin. Her statement was the same as Min's. When questioned, Deng Xizi, 8 years old, stated that many people brought him here and often gave him cakes to eat. He said that he was too young to tell the whole story. When questioned, the detained person, Qin Siyun, 31 years old, from Gaoyou, stated that his brother, Si Lian, came to Shanghai from his hometown this year and said that there was a kidnapping case, asking him to go and contact them. On the 19th of this month, he went to the bathhouse with Wang Lanxizi, Wang Peng, and Wang Weitong. At that time, Pan Asan handed him 290 yuan, which he handed over to Wang Weitong. Wang distributed 15 yuan to him, and he did not know how they distributed the rest. Tonight, Wang Weitong asked him, his brother Si Lian, and Qin Wancai to go to the Hongda steamer to demand another 210 yuan from Min Dayu. Wang had first gone to the third room of Longren Lane, No. 38 Yulin Road, Eight-Da-Tou, Yangshupu, to play mahjong, waiting for him to go. He did not expect the plan to fail and to be detained. Officers Yang Chunting and Liu Changrui were dispatched to the address to arrest Wang Hongtong and Wang Shoupeng, and they were brought back for questioning. Wang Weitong (aka Wang Boying), 40 years old, from Yancheng, stated that he had only been in Shanghai for a week. On the 19th of this month, Qin Silian and others said that there was a kidnapping case and asked him to go and contact them. He agreed and went and witnessed a person handing 290 yuan to Qin Siyun, but he did not handle the money himself. He also denied having Qin Siyun and others go to the Hongda steamer today to demand more money from Min Dayu. He claimed that on the 20th of this month, he had invited Yang A-quan, a detective from the Yangshupu Police Station, and his partner, Zhou Baokang, to arrest Qin Siyun and others, but he was afraid that the hostage would be harmed, so he did not carry out the arrest. Wang Shoupeng, 34 years old, from Gaoyou, stated that he saw Qin Siyun hand over the 290 yuan from Min's ransom to Wang Boying in the bathhouse. He also knew about Wang ordering Qin and others to go to the Hongda steamer today, but he had not received any of the money. The chief, considering that the matter involved a kidnapping case and the crime was serious, ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning and investigation.</p>
<h3>Inspection of the Kidnapping Site of Zhu Chengzhang</h3>
<p>Yu Yuan Road and Route Lafayatte</p>
<p>Judge Ge Examined in Detail</p>
<p>The kidnappers who kidnapped Lu Shaotang have been interrogated and sentenced by the Special District Court. Li Zhengtang and Li Sigong, who were arrested as suspects, were declared innocent due to lack of evidence. However, the police believed that the two Lis were involved in the case of Zhu Chengzhang, president of the National Goods Bank, being kidnapped and injured, so they continued to detain them. On the one hand, they filed a lawsuit with the Special Court, accusing them of kidnapping, extortion, and injury leading to death. The case had been opened once, but the proceedings were adjourned because it was necessary to inspect the location where the hostage was held, as reported in the previous newspaper. The reason why the two Lis were considered suspects was due to Zhu Chengzhang's last words. After Zhu returned from the injury, he went to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, his injuries were very serious, and as he was dying, he told his visiting friends that the location where he was kidnapped and held was near Route Lafayatte in the French Concession. When entering the house, it was necessary to pass through a garage, and so on. The police learned that Li Zhengtang had rented a house at No. 1233 Route Lafayatte for his friend Chen Shi. There was also a garage in front of the house. Therefore, Li was suspected, and he was accused of kidnapping and murder. In order to clarify the truth, Judge Ge Zhitan notified the Western Inspector Clark, who was handling the case, the defendant's lawyer Zhan Jifeng, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi, and the court clerk yesterday morning, and they took a car to the place where Zhu Chengzhang was kidnapped on Yu Yuan Road and the houses at No. 1231 and No. 1233 Route Lafayatte for detailed examination. The house was located along the road and had four floors. There was a stone staircase in front of the door for entering and exiting. There was a garage built on the side of the door, which was currently unoccupied. The rent for the house was 90 taels of silver per month. After the inspection, the judges and lawyers returned separately. It was said that the date for summoning witnesses and continuing the trial had been set for the afternoon of the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Private Trafficking of Firearms and Opium</h3>
<p>The Headquarters is Located at the New Inn on Xian Road</p>
<p>Secret Transportation of Opium and Pistols Between Shanghai and Wuhan</p>
<p>Currently Cracked by the Hongkou Police</p>
<p>Yong native Chen A-dao, Tang Lunfu, Wang Xiaopu, Wang Liding, and others specialized in privately trafficking firearms and opium. Their headquarters was located in Room 15 of the New Inn on Xian Road. All plans were secretly discussed in this room. Wang Liding worked as a cook on the Xiangtai steamer. Chen and others used his position to purchase opium from Hankou Gao when the steamer traveled from Hankou to Shanghai and had it secretly transported to Shanghai. When the steamer sailed from Shanghai to Hankou, they secretly carried pistols and ammunition with them. Both of these businesses were highly profitable, so each round trip of the steamer earned them considerable wealth. The other day, the date of Xiangtai's departure from Shanghai to Hankou, they gathered at the inn as usual to discuss transportation matters. Afterwards, they went to Wang Xiaopu's house on Ruijin Road and took out four pistols, which Wang sent to Li Ding's house at No. 374 Yuanfang Road. Liding then hid the weapons on his body after breakfast at around 8 o'clock, hired a rickshaw, and went to the East-West Huade Road Wharf to unload the weapons into the steamer. On the way, he was discovered by police investigator Ma Xiaozhi and patrolman Shen Dehui of the Hongkou Police Station, and they were taken to the police station. Under questioning, Ding Li confessed their entire plan. As a result, Chen, Tang, and Wang Xiaopu were arrested one after another. A piece of paper with a list of opium purchases was found on Chen, and 300 yuan in banknotes were found on Tang, all of which were found by the search. Yesterday morning, they were all handed over to the Special District Court, where Judge Xiao interrogated them. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the circumstances of the cracking of the case and presented the seized items to the court. The Chinese and Western inspectors then reported on the case. When questioned, Wang Liding completely denied all the details of the partnership in privately trafficking firearms and opium that he had confessed in the police station. He claimed that what he had said at the time was all nonsense. In fact, these pistols were entrusted to him by a friend surnamed Chou, who promised to give him a reward of 20 yuan. Because he had a grudge against Chen A-dao, he falsely accused him. His other statements were also very evasive. Chen A-dao stated that the list of accounts that was found on him was sent by Xiangji Company in Hankou, asking him to collect it on their behalf. Tang Lunfu stated that although he knew Liding, there was no partnership. Wang Xiaopu stated that he was going to Liding's house to collect membership fees, which led to his arrest. He claimed to be unaware of the firearms trafficking. He and Chen A-dao hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to defend them. Judge Xiao, considering that the case still needed to be investigated, ordered all the defendants to be detained for further investigation and handling.</p>

<h3>Reunion of an Old Love</h3>
<p>Unexpected Joy</p>
<p>Hu Gengbao, 24 years old, a resident of the Hu family's residence in northwest Wusong, worked as a pattern carpenter. In the spring of the 11th year of the Republic of China, when Hu was 15 years old, his parents hired a matchmaker to arrange for him to marry Wu Zhaodi, an orphaned girl from Jiangwan. Zhaodi was older than Hu. Because both the man and woman were under the age of majority, and Zhaodi was destitute, she was raised in Hu's home as a child bride. Although the two had not yet married, they loved each other very much. Unexpectedly, in July of that year, Hu's parents both died of an epidemic. Because the family was poor and had no money for coffins and burials, the clan made the decision to sell Zhaodi to Chen Houfu (32 years old), a farmer in Bei Wangzhai, about three miles away, as his wife. Hu was unwilling, but there was nothing he could do. Later, Hu was recommended to study pattern carpentry in Shanghai. Over the years, he had saved a little money and returned home to marry and start a family. However, something unexpected happened. Zhaodi had been sold to the Chen family for nine years. She had given birth to a son and a daughter, but both died before they were one year old. Her husband, Chen Houfu, did not engage in proper work, so over the years, the family property was lost. Recently, he colluded with an unscrupulous matchmaker to sell Zhaodi. The matchmaker learned that Hu had returned home to marry and approached Hu to propose the marriage. Hu felt that he had not sold Zhaodi of his own free will. He was overjoyed by this news. He paid 150 yuan and on the day before yesterday, he brought Zhaodi back to live with him in a palanquin. He also hosted a banquet to invite relatives and friends. Because Hu was Zhaodi's former husband-to-be, she was also very willing. For a time, the house was full of well-wishers, and it was very lively.</p>

<h3>The Benevolent Society Rescues a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Doctor Examines and Finds Her Body Covered in Wounds</p>
<p>The French Concession Has Seriously Investigated and Handled the Case</p>
<p>The China Benevolent Society received a report stating that "In the Wang family at No. 4 Tongkang Lane, Huacheng Road, French Concession, there is a girl who is only nine years old who is abused all day long. She is responsible for all the tasks of washing rice, cooking, doing laundry, and emptying the chamber pot. If she does not do well, she is severely beaten, even with a laundry stick to the head, causing injuries. Even in the middle of winter, she is made to sleep under the stove with only a mat. Recently, the girl was locked in a room and deprived of food for a day. Neighbors pity her and report to your society for rescue." After receiving the letter, the society sent Wang Guanyi and Zhang Yueru to investigate the neighbors. The neighbors' statements were the same as the report. They ordered the second landlord to bring the girl over. They saw that her face and eyes were injured and swollen, her hair had been pulled out, and her feet were also seriously injured, making it difficult for her to walk. Zhang took pictures and Wang registered the case. The girl said that she wanted to join the society and find a person named Huang, but she was hidden and not allowed to see him. Zhang and Wang took the girl to the Third Bureau of the French Police and explained the situation. They were given permission to send her to the society's training institute for care. They also sent a letter to the French Concession for investigation. The French Concession paid great attention to this case. The police had already sent officers to the society to question the girl and had a doctor examine her. The doctor's report showed that she had wounds all over her body. The police were furious and sent the girl back to the society for foster care and summoned Wang for investigation, hoping to deter others from doing the same. It is said that Wang has now gone into hiding. It is hoped that the authorities will punish him severely to deter others.</p>
<h3>Abducting a Married Woman</h3>
<p>Last night at six o'clock, the Fulong steamboat of the Sanbei Company's Yangtze River route arrived in Shanghai and berthed at the Hongsheng Pier in Yongdong. Detectives Zhang Chunting and Yang Jinsheng from the Third District Public Security Bureau boarded the ship for inspection. They soon discovered two men and two women in the steerage, whose behavior seemed suspicious. Upon questioning, one man claimed to be Huang Jinzhang, the other Wang Ashun, one woman Huang Ma's, and the other Cui Tang's. Their remaining statements were disjointed and untrue, so they were all detained and taken to the Third District. After the district head conducted a preliminary hearing with each of them individually, Huang Jinzhang was questioned first. He confessed that he was 54 years old, from Ningbo, and lived in the Xiannv Temple in Yangzhou, where he made a living collecting small goods and fabrics. He claimed he did not know Huang Ma's, but his wife was acquainted with Fan Laowu's wife from Yangzhou. Last year, Fan Laowu's wife brought a young woman (i.e., Ma's) to his house, claiming she was her niece and willing to be sold as a daughter. He paid 70 yuan for her. Later, seeing that Ma's was already of advanced age, he promised to marry her to a nephew of his friend Wang Ashun. Wang Ashun confessed that he was 41 years old, from Ningbo, and lived with Huang. He worked as a boatman. Recently, Huang had promised Ma's to his nephew as a wife, and he had paid a bride price of 70 yuan. He was now bringing her to Shanghai to marry his nephew. Huang Ma's confessed that her name was Lianxiao, she was 22 years old, from Jiangyan. Fan Laowu was her aunt's husband, and her husband had died. Her aunt's husband sent her to Huang's house, where she lived for many days. She heard that she was to be married to Wang Ashun's nephew. Cui Tang's confessed that she was 51 years old, from Yangzhou, and was in Shanghai to find her son. She knew Huang and the others, and they happened to be traveling in the same direction, but she was not related to them at all. The district head reviewed the confessions and, finding suspicious points, questioned Huang Jinzhang again, asking for Fan Laowu's wife's surname. Huang replied that he did not know. The district head said that if Ma's was Fan's wife's niece, then Fan's wife must also be surnamed Ma. Huang's face turned red, and he lowered his head without saying a word. The district head then interrogated Huang Ma's separately and explored the matter in detail. Ma's truthfully confessed that her original husband's name was Huang Yicheng, he was currently 32 years old, and had not died. She had been betrothed as a child bride at the age of twelve and married at twenty, and it had been two years since then, but she had not yet had children. Last year, she was lured away by Fan Laowu and his wife and lived in Huang's house. She was firmly instructed to say that Huang was a relative and Fan was her uncle. This was the truth. At this point, the district head, realizing the truth of the case, determined that Huang and the others were suspected of abducting a married woman to Shanghai and selling her. The prime culprits, Fan Laowu and his wife, were still at large. He ordered that the four men and women be sent to the General Bureau for questioning yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Fan Jinqi Requests Injury Examination</h3>
<p>Claims to Have Been Beaten by Members of the Defense Corps</p>
<p>Fan Jinqi, a native of Chongming, was carried to the local court yesterday afternoon, requesting an injury examination. His statement was roughly as follows: He currently runs the Xieji Restaurant at the South Pier in Pudong. A man nicknamed Xiaozhusheng owed him 12 jiao in meal expenses. He repeatedly demanded payment without success and was instead resented. On the 21st of this month, the South Pier Defense Corps arrested a petty thief who confessed that he had sold the stolen chicken to the Xieji Restaurant. Subsequently, Xiaozhusheng (a member of the corps) came to the restaurant, claiming to be conveying the corps leader's summons, ordering him to go to the corps for questioning. He went with him. Upon arriving at the corps' office, he did not see the corps leader. Zhu then closed the door and ordered the crowd to beat him, causing injuries all over his body. He cried out for help. Neighbors Zhou Rongfu, Tan Wenbin, and the school principal Xu heard the cries and opened the door, allowing him to escape danger. He was then escorted to the police station. Because he had already been beaten, he refused. He was then taken back inside. Later, the deputy corps leader Chen Qifeng arrived and released him. He estimated that he had lost 80 yuan in banknotes and 24 copper coins in the beating. The corps' cook recovered three copper coins. He suffered severe injuries from the beating and is currently receiving treatment at the Nanyang Hospital, which has issued a medical certificate. He requests that the injuries be examined and the matter thoroughly investigated and dealt with according to the law. Prosecutor Yang examined the injuries and confirmed that they were real but only heard one side of the story and is waiting for further instructions on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To All Newspapers and Sectors:</p>
<p>Respectfully, we inform you that our factory workers have been unreasonably striking for several days now, and are using one-sided propaganda to confuse right and wrong. We fear that the rumors may be inaccurate and lead to misunderstandings from all sectors, so we are providing a detailed account of the situation as follows: Our factory took over the Meixin Factory on March 4th and began reorganizing internally. Since starting, everything had been normal. On the 19th of this month, during the night shift, technician Yue Yutang was angered by joking with a female worker and struck her. This was reported to the management, who determined that Yue had violated factory rules by striking a female worker during working hours and dismissed him to appease the female workers. On the 20th at noon, the management dismissed worker Sun Maoer for repeatedly violating factory rules, arbitrarily entering and exiting during working hours, neglecting his work, and ignoring repeated warnings from the factory. At 4:00 PM, when wages were being distributed, Sun Maoer and another worker, Chen Peitang, forcibly demanded union dues from their colleagues, causing a major dispute. Fearing a disaster, the factory had no choice but to call the police to suppress the situation. The Lukiawan Police Station dispatched officers who took Sun and Chen, the two ringleaders, to the station for questioning. Afterwards, worker Jiang Jisheng arbitrarily shut down the main motor mechanism and shouted for a work stoppage, causing chaos in the factory. When the police officers dispatched to the factory to investigate saw this, they arrested Jiang Jisheng. The factory, thinking that the workers were ignorant and to avoid any accidents, requested that the police release the offending workers leniently. The police refused, citing public security concerns. After repeated requests from the factory, they agreed to temporarily detain them for a few hours and then release them. Therefore, the night shift on the 20th proceeded as usual. On the morning of the 21st, when workers were going to work, the released Sun Maoer, Chen Peitang, and Jiang Jisheng blocked the workers on the way and forced them to strike. Their behavior was fierce, and the workers, fearing their violence, did not dare to go to work, leading to the current strike. Upon learning of this, the factory immediately sent people to persuade the workers. Most workers were willing to return to work but were hesitant due to Sun's violent behavior and were adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The factory has been ringing the bell on time for several days, continuing to open the factory and preparing for resumption of work, but Sun and his associates continue to block workers from going to work, threatening them, so on the 22nd the workers who were willing to return to work and those who were forcing the strike engaged in mutual beatings. The factory does not know the details of how Sun Maoer was injured. Afterwards, Sun Maoer took the opportunity to submit a false report to the Social Affairs Bureau, falsely accusing the factory of instructing thugs to beat him, confusing right and wrong, which is truly outrageous. The facts are clear, and the truth is obvious. Any discerning person will know who is right and who is wrong. Labor and management are inherently complementary. Workers who do not abide by factory rules are harmful to the group, and the factory cannot condone them and removing them from the roll is not an overreaction. The dismissed workers, harboring resentment, are creating trouble, colluding with their cronies, inciting strikes, fabricating facts, and misleading listeners. Previous reports have contained inaccuracies, so we are providing a detailed account of the strike to all sectors so that they may know the truth and correct the situation. We hope that you will publish this.</p>

<p>Women's Life, the Life of Working Women in New York</p>
<p>Lin</p>
<p>(3) Living Expenses</p>
<p>How does a newcomer woman in New York find her accommodation? The first thing is naturally to ask the representative of the tourist guide, which is available at almost every important station. They can give her a temporary and safe place to live and help her find reliable accommodation. The YMCA has accommodation registration. Various churches and social bodies can tell a woman how to rent a comfortable and lovely room, and the rent is not very expensive. If you have enough money, you can live in any big hotel. Today's hotels are very safe. A single woman does not need to apologize for finding a room in a hotel.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we must talk about the suburbs of New York, including Long Island, Westchester, and New Jersey. As for Staten Island, it is a part of New York City, because it takes 25 minutes by ferry to get there, so it can also be called a suburb. If you live in the suburbs, you will inevitably avoid the two layers of trouble and expense. It is only suitable for women who are afraid of clutter and noise, and who prefer outdoor life to urban beauty. In the suburban area, you can also find shared houses, and the rent is slightly lower than in New York City. Other expenses depend on the distance from New York. In Long Island, the monthly fee can be reduced by ten to fifteen yuan, and New Jersey is slightly cheaper, because there are several places that can be reached from the Hudson Tunnel, which naturally saves a lot of transportation costs. The houses in the suburbs are not only well-lit, but the air is also more hygienic.</p>
<p>Although the price of food in New York is not very high compared to other cities, the price of meat is very expensive, generally twice as expensive as in smaller cities. Shops selling delicacies are everywhere, such as hot meat and raw vegetables, which can be purchased everywhere, but the prices are very expensive. Because working women living in shared houses do not have time to cook, they are often the patrons of these shops. In this way, her living expenses will increase a lot, although it is cheaper than eating in restaurants.</p>
<p>The rapid and chaotic life in big cities has a great impact on the consumption of clothing. Boots and shoes are easily damaged by friction on the road. In the crowded subways, clothes, hats, and coats cannot always be kept clean. If a woman sends her shirts to the laundry, the clothes will not last long. Smart working ladies must take care of their clothes. Of course, they cannot avoid wearing good clothes, and the cost of dry cleaning is very considerable. Working women need at least four sets of clothes to change, three sets of simple clothes, and one set of elaborate clothes is enough. She also needs clothes to wear in the evening, and evening dresses and casual clothes are essential. In New York, it is common to wear evening dresses to banquets, theaters, or dances, which is different from other places. Two sets of outerwear are also needed when going out. Socks and shirts are the most expensive. A well-dressed working woman must have at least four pairs of shoes to match her robes. Hats, gloves, scarves, and other essential parts must be selected and purchased according to the current trends in order to match her status. It is very important that clothing matches the job, especially for women who want to get ahead, and cannot be ignored. There are hundreds of clothing shops in New York, but several of them are in style and sell at reasonable prices. There are also some that are famous for selling "savage heads," and the prices on the goods are incredibly expensive, often deceiving customers and grabbing huge profits. Newcomer working women are best to buy clothes from reputable shops, which is always more cost-effective. When she is familiar with the city, she can choose smaller and more familiar shops and mix and match her clothes at will. In this way, she will know the true meaning of genuine goods at fair prices. Working women do not have free time to often purchase goods like family women, so they are often fooled. She is best to consider the style and wearability of the clothes she buys.</p>
<p>Getting sick in New York City is the most unfortunate thing. If a woman feels unwell or lacking in energy, it is best to avoid this noisy city. In the fierce and colliding life of New York, you must have strong energy to cope with it. If a woman gets sick in this city, the fees for hospitals and doctors are prohibitively expensive. The cost of hospitals is [blank] yuan, which can completely deplete a person's savings. All women who can be independent do not want to go to charitable hospitals. The fees for dentists should also be noted.</p>
<p>Women in New York City cannot be compared to when she was in her hometown. She must take care of her finances, she must fight to [blank] of course, in [blank] married women in New York have jobs. The husbands of these working women generally do not earn enough salary to maintain the household, so young wives have to come out to work and supplement the family. These kinds of working women do not value their job positions very much.
