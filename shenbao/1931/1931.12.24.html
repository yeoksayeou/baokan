<p>時評</p>
<h3>謹貢獻於一中全會——改革敎育</h3>
<p>在整個軍人政治與官僚政治之棼圍中。一切皆爲混亂爲落伍爲腐蝕爲奄奄無生氣敎育之不能單獨超出此混亂之洲　。自爲必然之事實。準此可知我國近二十年敎育之破產。文化之日益衰落。亦即爲在軍人政治與官僚政治之惡環境下所收之惡果。</p>
<p>今日之言及敎育者。輒嘆息痛恨於靑年學生。或謂學生爲好亂性成。或謂學生爲暴戾不可敎訓。尤其自近數月靑年學生以外交問題之剌激。相率而輟學請願示威以來。更有人視若洪水猛獸視此種現象爲二十年來敎育之惡果。而頗欲着手於整頓敎育。戴季陶氏且以此對全國敎育界作救國先求國家命根的靑年救國先救敎導靑年的學校之疾聲呼籲。中央亦以此而有組設特種敎育委員會之計劃。吾人誠不能否認今日之敎育爲破產。同時更不能否認今日靑年之激越悲憤。不安心求學爲一種病態。吾人固承認今日敎育亟應整頓。靑年亟應挽救。然而吾人不能同意於舉一切罪戾一切過失都歸咎於靑年。更不能同意於不求　掘致使敎育破產之根因。而徒加重靑年思想上之禁錮吾人認爲致使敎育破產之責不應歸諸學生靑年。而應歸諸整個社會整頓敎育。不應愈益加重靑年之禁錮。反之却正應予靑年思想上與活動上以絶對之自由發揚其生命之力。開浚其思想之泉源。使其活潑前進。以改革并推進整個之社會與國家</p>
<p>社會即一大學校也社會之諸色相。即實際敎材也。然而今日之社會爲何若。社會之一切現實又何若政治家日從事於權利之角逐。日陷於私慾之沉洏。種種卑鄙恥辱不可思議之行爲。由個人而擴大至整個社會。使整個社會陷於混亂之狀態靑年處此情勢之下。耳濡目染。接受此種實際敎育。意志不健全者。即爲其所同化投入惡濁之漩　。其意志堅强者。則燭見社會之矛盾不合理自起而反抗。力謀改造。政治家一方而從行爲上供給靑年以惡的敎材。直接致使敎育日趨於破滅。而欲從口頭上挽回敎育之刧運。使靑年能一致步入光明廣坦之前途。斯不僅爲不可能而且中重靑年之禁錮。根本斬斷國家社會前途之一線生機。正爲一種極其重大之罪過。</p>
<p>再就學校本身而言。平素所謂神聖之敎育界。今亦爲軍人政治官僚政治所侵入大學校長常持武力爲奥援。爭奪角逐極盡縱横捭闔之手段。兼職遙領。已成慣例而敎師之敷衍塞責。不視所事爲終身事業。取容當局。結纳學生。以固一已之衣食地位尤爲不可掩飾之事實。在政府方面。則於敎育經費。每不發給。移作别用。國家年費百分之八十以上之國帑於軍費。而關係國本之敎育經費。竟毫無着落。使敎師典衣以維持其生活。斯亦爲今日之世界僅有之現象。在此情勢之下。而責靑年不安心讀書。而咎敎育之徒種惡因。是誠明於責人而昧於責已知其果而昧其因。政治如不能澄　。整個社會如不能改革。則整頓敎育推進文化皆爲空談。</p>
<p>吾人認爲今日而欲言整頓敎育。自其消極一方面言之。必須確定並使敎育經費獨立無論如何不能移敎育經費以作别用。使從事敎育者。不至炊成無米。常感心餘力絀。次之。必盪洗敎育界依附實力傾軋爭奪兼遙領結纳取容之惡習。使從事敎育者必爲專家保障其生活使其得安心致力於所事。至其在積極方面者。則政治舞臺上之人物。與一般社會領袖亟應正其本身之行爲。樹立靑年之規範。而尤應掊掘軍人政治官僚政治之根基。俾政治得以淸明。社會得以安定。一切都纳於合理之正軌。再次必須使靑年在思想上在學術上獲得絶對之自由。使其能接受世界之新潮流新學說。使其生命之活力。能得自由發展。以推進文化。改造社會。</p>
<p>吾人認爲敎育非笨滞之機械敎育之運用。亦非如運用機械之有一定之動作吾人認爲敎育爲社會之上層建築。整頓敎育必先安定整個之社會。吾人認爲敎育之目的爲推進社會。增進人類之福祉。而非爲保守現狀。使人類長淪於疾苦之深淵。吾人認爲敎育爲活的動的前進的。而非死的因循的停滞的明乎此始足以言敎育。亦惟明乎此。始足以言整頓敎育</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<p>特載</p>
<p>抗日與軍事訓練（王庚）</p>
<p>抗日　後的辦法、是軍事解决、軍事訓練的目的是在全民衆都有軍事學識和技能最後的目的、是在鞏固國防現在訓練總監部已通令全國中等以上軍校一律加緊軍事訓練、這誠是靑年救國的根一辦法、不過對於受訓練者基本認識、尙宜加以注意、作者對於此道、已幹過好幾年、其中弊害、略知一二、兹在全民衆一致抗日、靑年加緊軍事訓練聲中、就管見所及、敬貢獻與全國敎育界及靑年們、</p>
<p>第一要有主義　中山先生的革伅所以能夠成功、因恃有三民主義、一件事情、無論大小、如果没有主義、决不會有最後之成功的軍事訓練如無主義、其所造成之軍隊、定無用處、日俄之戰、倭奴有雪恨主義、所以能一戰而勝俄、法國革命、兵士都抱有自由平等主義、雖血戰數十年、仍得最後之成功、又如美國兵隊有門羅主義、倭奴　隊有大亞細亞主義德國軍隊有海外殖民主義、他們所抱的主義對不對、是另、問題、我們應該知道、主義一定是要有的、我們的軍事訓練、應該要抱定救國主義、也可說是抵抗主義、</p>
<p>第二要有公敵　軍隊一定要有公敵、有公敵則兵士必勇往直前、百戰百勝、如一八七○年普法之戰、法人之公敵爲德國、中日戰後、日本之公敵爲俄國、歐戰之後美國之公敵爲日本、他們平日訓練軍隊、都設想公敵如何如何以備與戰、我們的軍事訓練也應有公敵、公敵爲誰、是倭國與列强、</p>
<p>第三要嚴肅服從　軍隊的實力有兩種、一種是有形的實力、如兵馬的多少、兵器之銳利等、一種是無形的實力、如嚴肅整齊·服從·勇敢等無形的實力、關於戰鬥力之大小甚大、一個軍隊如果具有此種無形實力足以制勝敵隊者在歷史上歷歷可數昔武昌發難時、首領是一位熊炳坤排長只有三十一粒子彈、即下武昌城、諸位試想三十二粒子彈即一彈打死一人、也不過打死三十二人、這完全是依籍無形實力之故因此軍事訓練宜絶對戒除一切浪漫隨便等惡習、</p>
<p>第四要吃苦耐勞　軍事訓練的目的旣在鞏固國防、則將來開戰、是和外國人開戰、不是和中國人自已開戰、和外國人開戰、决没有和内戰時之便當從前有一位軍事專家曾告訴我過、他說將來和外國人打伏恐怕不能和内戰時向前跑要爬向前進因電綱砲火之利害决不能直立向前進也、空中有飛機擲彈因此防守時也要在　溝内生活、試問一個人没有耐勞性和吃苦的能力能在這種情况中過活嗎所以我們受軍事訓練時、宜决心抱定吃苦和耐勞的精神</p>
<p>以上所述四點、皆軍隊上之根本要點、靑年信吾言乎、請速猛醒而力行之國家之幸也、（作於無錫敎育學院）</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>宋蘇坡癖硯。所　多精品。迨及今世。百不存一。而現時以藏硯得名者。首推許脩直林白水二氏。但林所藏硯。遠不如許之多而精也。海内號稱百硯室主者。即許也。　所見之蕉葉白玉带黄端血絲蘭亭殘石等諸名硯。近聞均爲許氏出重金購藏。癖硯之深。於此可見。惟林氏歸道山後。所藏之硯。大半爲日人收去。祇有靑花冰紋大硯二方。尙在中國。許氏竊恐又爲日人購去。乃輾轉托人向林氏後　情商。已將靑花冰紋硯覓得。特設筵於百硯室中。邀請王福安秦綗孫賀天健等。互相品評。均極贊許。所謂冰紋者。形如柳絲低垂。色澤甚美。却爲近代絶無僅有之寳硯。乃磋商之下。仍由許氏購藏。以免流入扶桑三島間。即席各賦一詩。以誌鴻爪。比及席散。已魚更三　矣。</p>

<h3>如何可以不做一個時代落伍者？</h3>
<p>答復一位靑年小學敎師的信</p>
<p>…接讀你的信，知道你有努力上進之志，我是何等的欣慰啊！我們要不願做時代的落伍者，必須專攻一門自然科學。自然科學是開向理想世界去的快車，你坐在上面，不要出來，决不致落伍。我現在也打算用我後半生之精力來專攻一門科學。我們同坐這部車兒去吧！從農業文明渡到工業文明，自然科學是惟一的橋梁。小學敎師必須拿着科學的火把引導兒童過渡。不懂科學的人，不久便不能做敎師了。但是有一件事您得留心，科學已經被屠户用做殺人的利器。我們應當從屠户的手裏把科學奪過來。我們要敎學生用科學渡人不用科學阻人過渡。我們要拿科學來抑强扶弱。科學的使命是要造富的社會不造富的個人。自然科學没有成爲國貨以前，我們要取得自然科學上最新的知識與方法，還得精通一種外國文。這都是你要認淸而必須準備的。你來我們詳說吧！………</p>
<h3>出征</h3>
<p>— 靑年援馬團一團員</p>
<p>（七）離無錫</p>
<p>檸檬色的太陽。斜掛在遠遠的樹梢頭上。這時候大約是五點多鐘吧。車身仍如風馳電掣地向前奔跑。忽然地聽得一陣炸彈般的聲響從西面送來。我們被這種聲音奮發了精神。但祇是内心被撼動着。我們的視線並不移向車窗外面。仍舊很鎭靜地在車廂裏坐着。因爲軍人最要（守秩序）的紀律。不久。車靠近了站台。祇見歡迎的同胞很熱烈地拍掌高呼。我這才明白了剛才的響聲。就是從他們的掌心發出來的。</p>
<p>我們下了站台。稍稍摒擋一切。便魚貫出了車站。由保安隊的音樂隊在前領導。直至武進縣黨部下榻。當晚蒙縣政府設筵欵待盛極一時。</p>
<p>常州的梳　。在江蘇素負盛名。還記得十八年春。我和爹爹媽媽姊姊弟弟等。在這裏游覧時。嘗買了兩副梳　带回家去。如今媽媽和姊姊仍在用着。現在舊地重臨。睹物思人。不由我不憶起家裏的人們。但是我唯有望着太空祈求。默祝家人快樂而已。我又想。這時的情形。好像（舉頭望明月低頭思故鄉）這句唐詩一樣。於是我就把這件事—思鄉的事—當作了詩意。是理想的詩意。在現在我們應該立即投筆從戎。那管得細味這包涵萬象的詩的神聖。</p>
<p>今早（十五日）常州各界又如無錫一樣舉行歡迎和歡送大會。到會者約有五六千人。會畢。到會的人們送我們到車站。霎時站台上擁擠不堪。後來者已無立足地。三時餘。汽笛一鳴。車蠕蠕動。送行者頻頻揮手致别。常女中的女生多數珠淚滂沱。可知伊們的芳心固早已爲國憔悴了。</p>
<h3>誌董修甲</h3>
<p>— 質君</p>
<p>新任蘇建廳長之董修甲氏。爲留美學生之前輩。道德文章。頗多足稱。最難能可貴者。厥爲一生無嗜好。雖吸捲烟而每日僅二三枝。酒色則絶不沾染、。賭博更無論矣。前蘇民廳長胡樸安氏與董氏共事路局者凡五六載。嘗謂董先生一生無一分鐘光陰之浪費。其人品可以見矣。近年電影潮勃起幾有無人不看電影之勢。獨董氏旅居滬濱多年。至今不知新光光陸可在。嘗有約晤於奥迪安者。遲至四時許不見其駕到。竊訝董氏素不爽約。何竟食言。更待一刻鐘許。始見其满頭大汗而至。蓋已尋覓達一小時之久矣。亦雋聞也。</p>
<h3>耶誕新聲</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>光陰荏苒。一年一度之耶誕節。又惠臨矣。西方人士。每遇耶誕。親友間相互酬酢。備極熱閙。然今日科學昌明。社社風俗。遂亦因之日異。而今年之耶誕。更有極大之變化焉。</p>
<p>莫斯科反耶誕運動　俄國自革命而後。反對宗敎甚力。學校之中。一切宗敎課程。均在取締之例。此種政策。迄今未變。而每屆耶誕。亦例有反宗敎運動之舉。本年於十二月初。耶誕前二星期舉行。商店之中。各種禮物。及兒童玩具。均不准出售。並將所有聖誕樹。於事前盡力伐除。一方並禁止農人。出售聖誕樹。蘇俄以宗敎之劇烈。亦可見一般矣。</p>
<p>聖誕老人之大革命　歐西各國。每屆耶蘇聖誕例有餽贈禮物。爲兒童購買糖菓玩具等風俗。然今年則此種習俗。已有改變之趨向。蓋西人以爲此種致意及送禮之方法。太嫌陳舊。應有改革之必要。故皆用由電話之中。直接致賀之法。此外更有用電訊傳眞。以本人之親筆賀語或肖像。嶒送親友。且英國人士。欲將其照片。贈送寄居於奥丹德意挪威。瑞士等處之親友者。在二十分鐘内即可到達。迅速便利。莫甚於此也。</p>
<p>飛機散發聖誕卡片　英國郵局方面。一事前已深知耶誕之前。將有大批電攝照片及致賀之電報。交通界將備極忙碌。是故已决定用飛機投遞耶誕卡片。以期迅速。並擬用無線播音。庶各人發電致賀。澳大利亞航空公司。亦預備自十八日起。收集聖誕卡片及賀年片。用飛機投送。以免遺誤時日云。</p>
<h3>雞譚</h3>
<p>— 紙帳銅瓶室主</p>
<p>雞爲冬令唯一滋補品。其功效高於一切羊膏牛脯乳汗豆漿之上。昔李合肥每於冬月。日啖童雞一。精神奮發。終歲治事無疾痛。又吾師胡布衣之哲嗣。疽發於背以刀剜之。戒絶葷腥。奈創口下陷及寸。久久不平。乃殺雞佐餐。日以爲常。不半月。缺陷悉補。此又一明證也。　　遜淸時。京師西便門外白雲觀道士高某。善製雞丁。楊梅竹斜街之萬福居。師承其法。名聞禁内。號高雞丁。予友黄怡如客京師久。曾一嘗之。贊美不絶口。洵佳味也。</p>
<p>昔睢陽湯斌之官吳中也。其夫人及諸公子。服御殊樸素。春野薺生。日采取和豆羹以爲饌。民間因有豆腐湯之諺語。見某日市隻雞。公愕曰。吾至吳未嘗食雞。誰市者也。僕叩頭曰。公子。公怒。立召公子跪庭下責之曰·汝謂蘇州雞賤似河南耶。汝思啖雞。便歸去。惡有士不嚼菜根而能作百事哉。並答其僕遣之。一時傳爲笑柄。</p>
<p>古文家方望溪生甫四歲。父日授諸經。嘗早起以雞聲隔霧命對。即應聲曰龍氣成雲。其頴慧如此。</p>
<p>贛之泰和縣。產錦雞。五色斑斕。美前總統塔孚脫愛蓄之。日必親飼穀粒云。</p>
<p>德瑪爾廠以冷榨法製雞汁。行銷徧歐洲。以是每年殺雞多至三萬萬隻。對於雞之鑒别。備極精密。蓄雞之塲。其廣大雖古之雞坊。不是過也。</p>

<p>聞雞起舞。此祖逖之雄風也。當此外侮日亟。國難臨頭。我國民春各以祖逖爲師表。以雞聲爲警鐘。斯可矣。</p>
<h3>高君珊歐美歸來話國難（七）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>中國是日本的大商塲。所以抵貨運動如能永久堅持下去。就可以使日本受經濟上很大的損失。但是抵貨運動嵵廛衣動搖的危險。有許多商人。因爲積貨太多。銀根吃緊。所以很想立刻將存貨推銷。更有少數奸商。要想將已登記的日貨。無條件的散賣。以便同時售脫後來私進之日貨。近來社會人士。對於處置封存日貨的辦法。頗有所論列。其中尤以主張將日貨擱置數月。然後集中公賣的辦法爲最合理想。如此。則將來中日問題如得完满解决。經濟復交之後。仍可再進日貨。至少日本已受此一個時期以内的損失了。</p>
<p>我以爲中日問題必無满意的結果。現時所爭者。不過嗚虧的多少而已。至於抵貨運動。必須永久堅持下去。從今以後。我國民立誓永久不用日貨。以給日本經濟上一小小創痛。至於現時封存的日貨。如爲救濟市面銀根的緣故。不得不急賣出。則須指定一適宜地點。集中公賣。以杜弊端。現在有人對於集中公賣。反對甚烈。而且竭力主張自由散賣。凡是明眼的人。都可以看出這種主張。不是忠實抵貨的商家所贊成的。祇有少數份子。别有用意。故有此提議。我們大家對於這一點。千萬要時時刻刻去注意。不要使千辛萬苦的抵貨運動。功虧於一簣。這次抵貨。全靠商人自動的覺悟。所以成績較之以前幾次爲好。希望一般愛國的商人。始終如一的去幹。不要被少數人所操縱。至於一般民衆。手無寸鐵。不能大家上疆塲去殺敵。要想救國。永久的抵制日貨。要算是一種很重要的工作了。（完）</p>

<h3>與子同仇（三）</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第五章　沙塲喋血</p>
<p>砲兵營長任遠也說道。太陽軍在在有接應。我軍孤單無援。軍火糧實缺乏得很。前次出兵時候。都賴太陽國的接濟。現在兩次劇戰後。消耗已過半數。若要和他們堂堂正正的交綏。恐怕衆寡不敵。萬難獲勝。不如擇一險要山頭。暫行退守。將來聯絡了H省的軍隊。再作道理。華乃强聽了。點點頭道。很好。但我不諳地理。此處附近不知可有什麽險要的山谷。容我們暫止。任遠道。有有。距離野雞崗六七十里多路。在那邊有個蜈蚣嶺。端的十分幽險。因爲那山的進口祇有一條窄道。兩邊部是峻險絶壁。高不可攀。形如蜈蚣。故名蜈蚣嶺。眞合着一夫當關萬夫莫開的古話。我們若據守在那裏。敵人雖衆。難以深入。嶺上俯瞰遠近。十分明瞭。只要架了大砲。向敵人轟撃。敵人難以越過砲火線的。并且山中有田可耕。也有良民居住。糧食上不愁缺乏了。華乃强道。旣有這個去處。我夋明晨准即拔隊前往。忠淑道。最可惡的太陽軍。倚仗着飛機利害。向我們不絶地攻撃。我們又没有高射砲。所以大受影響。任遠道。我們有的平射砲。倘將砲口轉移向上。也好轟撃低下的飛機。華乃强道。那麽以後若有敵人飛機來時。便請任營長試。任遠點點頭道。可以可以。於是衆人在營中暫宿一宵。次日淸晨。華乃强起身。忠淑也走過來。二人步出營帳。立在崗上。透空氣。華乃强珔要傳令部下開拔。只見遠遠雲端裏有兩點黑影。不多時便聞軋軋之聲。有兩隻紅色的太陽軍飛機向這邊駛來。愈近愈大。在空中　翔一圈。漸漸降低。這時衆人一齊戒備。華乃强和忠淑兀然立着。聲色不動。有一隻飛機忽的向下一抛。抛出一個炸彈來。正落在崗上。炸去數匹戰馬。華乃强仍是鎭靜。令部下舉槍待放。接着便聽訇的一聲。一顆砲彈從崗上樹林裏飛起。正撃中一隻太陽軍的飛機。墮落崗下深澗裏去了。那一隻飛機嚇得不敢逗留。疾馳飛回去了。衆人無不稱快。原來任遠見飛機前來。便將平射砲架在林中。砲口向上。靜俟着飛機降下扔彈的時候。便瞒準發出一砲。果然命中。華乃强和忠淑一齊大喜。便令部下整隊赴蜈蚣嶺。由任遠引導。到了那邊山中。紮下營寨。埋鍋造飯。乃强便和忠淑任遠一齊到山口視察地勢。果然峻險曲折。華乃强遂令任遠率砲兵營駐在山上。又令步兵兩營扼守山口。聯合防禦。</p>

<h3>棉市虚落</h3>
<p>棉市軟化、形勢平淡、本月份跌風愈劇、以實需不動、各廠因外棉吃飽對於本棉杜絶、故交貨者較衆、市氣尤弱、惟遠月因多頭拉力更强、毫無放鬆之念、然漢埠到貨漸見增加、棉市前途殊乏把握、不過大勢暗淡、</p>

<h3>粉市徘徊不前</h3>

<h3>麥市形同停頓</h3>

<h3>花旗靑鉛昨到五十噸</h3>
<p>五金交易、爾來極寂、蓋歲車云暮、各帮均備結束、新以成交甚微、苟有採辦、亦不果配花色而已、而各市標準、則因人心萎靡、出路滞澀、是以頗多下游、雖各同業維持之心頗堅、但終以環境不良仍不免有江河日下之象、查到貨踴躍、先令放長、實爲最大原因、如靑鉛一項、前因存厚、同業頗以爲苦、而今則浦東又到五十噸、緣是市氣更疲、標準祗估十四兩、比前又跌二錢半、而實交方面、祗有零星而已、因之前途趨况、更不易樂觀也云、</p>

<h3>家庭敎師</h3>
<p>— 丁奴</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>算是他的幸運、在世界經濟起恐慌的當兒、他完成了他的大學敎育、但小資產階級的氣味、做了他底到學問境界云的障礙、而森嚴不可踰越的社會門牆、是又恰到好處、限　了他離開學校以後的去路、就在這七凑八合的局勢中、他做了無聊的家庭敎師、</p>
<p>雖酒喝過量當然不舒服、但没有喝上量、也不是舒服的事、所以他自執着敎鞭以來、並没有比以前在閑着没事的當兒、若悶有些减少、在没有事做的時候總想找些事來幹幹、好像天空作陰的時節、總希望太陽光出來、好來換一換空氣、但眞的太陽光透出來了時、未見得就愉快、那時你的不舒服、也許因爲光線太强、或是太弱些、世界上本來就没有一蹴即完全達到合於理想的境界、在歷史上有許多爲我們所崇拜的人物、他們在未做到顯達時、也曾過着很苦的生活、在苦悶到了極度的時候、他只好把這些理論來做他暫時的安慰、除了目前、若說到將來、他自已也茫然、</p>
<p>在學校裏的時候、他本有計劃如何安排他出校後的生活、但眞實跑到了社會上去時、却又心惶足亂、束手無策、由於現實的感騐、他知道了那些計劃只是個空想、在二十世紀的科學世界、而懷有空想的人物、那根本就不能存在、受到現實的幻滅、那是應當的、他根本體認了他的命運、把希望的金斧放下、來投降這社會、可憐他像個社龍下束手待縛的無自主的神徒、</p>
<p>在社會面前、他顯示了他的無能、但在一般故舊的相知的面前、他却没有像投降社會的勇氣來暴露他的弱點、這兩種不同的勢力、在他心靈上交戰、起初、他還茫然這交戰的由來、待往深一層去考究時、他才知道這是由於一方面是新舊時代過渡期的反映、一方面是由於小資產階級的尊榮在那裏牽連作崇、他常常這樣想、如果自已是一個中學生、那還不要緊、但以一個堂堂的大學生、來幹這没出息的勾當、那就大塌身份了、再不然、自已如果是窮家出身、那也不要緊、每月有三十塊錢拿、也算不了倒霉、但以小資產階級的身份、若在學生時代、這三十塊錢、只好作一次花、那就倒霉極了、所以在朋友的面前、他老是不敢說出他所做的什麽事、有時給朋友追問到迫得非答覆就不可時、也只好說、（我没有事做）　　他以爲與其說做家庭敎師、還是說没有事做好、說没有事做、還足以表示他的才能還没有沾定價格、說做家庭敎師、那就明明宣告他所沽定的價格是太低了　　（二）</p>
<p>眼看着光陰的輪子趁向後面滾去、而所做的事情又没有出息、他感到悲傷了、</p>
<p>他带着悲傷的影子、從百貨店裏走過、他看見玻璃櫃裏面、很美麗地張飾着、一項一項的擺着那些耶誕節的送禮品、他打量了很久、徘徊地幾乎不肯走去、他懊喪極了、想起自已在目前是没有力量好來買這些禮物、送送幾位親近的朋友、在去年的耶誕節、他還花了二十多塊錢東西、贈送一位姓俞的女朋友、和幾位男同學、而這幾位男同學當中特别是那一位姓吳的收受最多、現在、這位姓吳的同學回到香港的家裏去了、他有洋房住、有美麗的愛人擁抱、生活自然比他自已舒適得多、但命運却是一樣、聽說他最近因爲父親的命令、呌他到一家銀行去實習、他來信說、他一點也不慣、名爲到去實習、事實上只看人家忙來忙去、自已便搖起脚來抽烟、等鐘點到了、便戴上帽子走、雜在忙人的隊伍裏、架子是十足、但空殼的生活、夠難受了、</p>
<p>從姓吳的同學身上、他再想到那位姓俞的女朋友、他記着去年冬裏、他們住在北四川路的時候、這位女朋友常常跑來玩、玩得多麽有趣啊、他很愛她、愛她的一對迷人的眼睛、多麽　　　　呀、有一天晚上、各人喝了幾分酒、醉薰薰的、她撥開嬌喉、唱起一曲武家坡來了、這歌聲、直透他的心腑、惹得他心醉魂蕩、恨不得就上前吻個痛快、温馨的回憶、使他益發傾慕起這位女朋友來、然而、落花有意、流水無情、這位女朋友已給她的一位親戚攫去了、好不令人氣短、</p>
<p>回到房裏、腦海裏盡是些凌亂的思想、一刻如身置人山人海的十字街頭、一刻如身置雪地冰山的頂上、</p>
<p>耶誕節不久就快要到了、他爲此着急起來、他希望能如願籌到一筆小欵、好在耶誕節的晚上到跳舞塲去痛快地跳一回、但看看情勢、似乎是要呌他失望、他想寫幾篇稿來換幾塊錢、但總寫不出、同時爲他所千望萬望的家欵、到現在又還無聲無息、使人要懷欵不知有否寄來就寄來了又不知能否趕上應用、諸如此類的擔憂、壓迫得他有如熱鍋上的螞蟻一樣、</p>
<p>直等到一位朋友看出他的心情、答應替他設法籌到這筆小欵、他才安然了、　　（三）</p>
<p>這幾天、天氣轉冷了、北風又括得很大、他不能到外面去走了、只好躱在亭子間裏、但到底天氣太冷了、雖有說有笑、也不感到舒服、從這時起、他便有了主意要在房裏安置火爐、好舒舒服服地把一冬度過、爲這問題、他又皺起眉梢來了、雖然安置火爐不必需要許多錢、但在他的經濟狀况下面、就絶對辦不到、他每月只能夠拿到三十元的薪水、除了付房租伙食以外、所餘的就有限了、那再有餘資用作他途、所以他又開始煩燥起來了、　　這一晚他從公館敎書回來已經是十點鐘了、外面正落着雨、</p>
<p>疎黑的頭髮上的雨珠在黯淡的燈光之下抖着、他的臉更顯得蒼白了、他脫了濕的衣服、頽然地落在椅子裏開始喘息起來、</p>
<p>没有神氣的眼光在房的四周打量了一週後、便落到對面牆上掛着的明星像片、這明星是　　　　　　　　、正對他微笑、他認出這微笑不懷好意、像是在說、國難臨頭了、你還沉醉在温馨的回憶裏、找尋個人舒適的生活、該死的、</p>

<h3>米·棉·紗（續）秦建南</h3>
<p>商品叢刋第一編第二編第三編</p>
<p>上海銀行調查部編</p>
<p>三、紗</p>
<p>（紗）的篇論最多、凡二百數十頁、論列亦最詳、其組職與上二篇亦相似、分爲下列各節、（一）上海棉紗之種種類、說明支數的意義、支數的種類、及商標的分類、（二）上海棉紗之供需推定、上海棉紗供給年凡一百二十餘萬包、其中十包運往外洋、七十萬包運往國内各埠、四十餘萬包則供本埠大小織布廠之用、（三）上海棉紗之運銷、叙述各客帮與報關之性質、運輸費用及客銷之性質、並附以上海棉紗在我國棉紗贸易上的地位、（四）上海棉紗之交易、分紗號、棉紗掮客、洋行、交易所與經紀人四點叙述、（五）上海之紗廠、叙述其沿革、组織、機器、及營業、（六）上海紗業之金融、列舉紗業中一切集資籌欵之方、（七）上海棉紗之價值搜集十餘年之統計、詳爲分析、以得其長期趨勢、及種種變動的原因、（八）上海紗業之團體、（九）上海紗業改良之方針、討論客帮、紗號、及紗廠應改良之點、</p>
<p>該書精彩之處甚多、兹舉數點、以資介紹、</p>
<p>（一）對於各牌棉紗的銷路特加注意何牌銷何帮、均根據實地調查、詳細記載、對於從事之紗業者、不無可參考之處、　　（二）對於日紗的經營特加注意　上海日紗的勢力、在未抵制以前、大於中紗、該篇對於日紗的經營、特爲注意、在上海棉紗之供需中、即說明（上海廠紗之供給就數量言、日商固不如華商、就價值言、則華商遠不及日商、）因爲日商紡的是細紗、而華商紡的是粗紗、同是一包紗、價值相去甚遠、在上海棉紗之運銷中、又說明華商棉紗的運銷、遠不如日商棉紗的普遍、在上海之紗廠中、叙述上海中日紗廠的消長、而歸納到華廠的不能利用機會、更在上海紗業之金融中、比較中日紗廠的金融、以明其强弱之點、吾人欲抵制日貨先必了解日貨的所以取勝、本書於此點特别着重、可作抵制日紗的參考書、　　（三）對於辦紗客帮亦特加注意　普通談紗業、只集中於紗廠、很少注意於客帮的、可是客帮控制了棉紗的需要、其勢力實不可輕視、本書對於各帮詳述其性質金融交易等、並討論其改善的方法、也是難得的材料、</p>
<p>（四）對於紗價有很精密的探討　該書將十年來紗價、繪成曲線、令人一目瞭然、並求出其銀數、爲一百五十七兩餘、及其變動的程度、爲十兩左右、因此而推得棉紗投機的利益或損失、再推論棉紗價格的分子、舉例證明、對於紗價上一切問題、均有討論、</p>
<p>本篇附錄有全國紗廠一覧、上海紗號一覧、上海紗業經紀人一覧及上海辦紗客帮一覧等、全篇材料較上述二篇爲多、所有統計亦頗確當、凡關心於棉紗問題的、很值得去參考一下、（該三書發售處、係上海銀行信託部及四馬路黎明書局、）</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Occupy Tianzhuangtai Township</h3>
<p>Our Armored Train Engaged in Fierce Battle with Japanese Troops at Tianzhuangtai Station</p>
<p>First Plenary Session of the Central Committee Appoints Wu Chaoshu as Acting Chairman of the Special Foreign Affairs Committee</p>
<p>Battle Occurring in Tianzhuangtai</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Cross the Liao River and Advance</p>
<p>Already Occupied Tianzhuangtai Village and Township</p>
<p>Our Armored Train Resisting</p>
<p>Niuzhuang Also Attacked Yesterday</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Four to five hundred Japanese soldiers with over ten artillery pieces occupied Tianzhuangtai township at 5 PM on the 23rd. Our armored train is still defending Tianzhuangtai station and is engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Jinzhou: (1) On the morning of the 23rd, a small unit of Japanese troops leading over a hundred workers advanced from Yingkou towards Weijiagou. Our armored train has already departed from Goubangzi to inspect. (2) At 12:30 PM on the 23rd, our armored train arrived between Tianzhuangtai and Yingkou to inspect the section of the railway that had been destroyed by Japanese troops. Approximately five hundred Japanese soldiers formally opened fire on our armored train. Our side resisted, and a fierce battle ensued. By 1:30 PM, the Japanese armored train retreated. Subsequently, approximately four to five hundred Japanese cavalrymen circled to the left side of our armored train and opened fire. The battle was still ongoing at 4 PM. (3) Fearing that the railway tracks would be destroyed, our armored train retreated to the east of Tianzhuangtai, outside Yangqi. Upon hearing the news, the covering unit of our armored train urgently departed from Goubangzi to provide assistance. (4) At Mazizi, southeast of Tianzhuangtai, there were five to six hundred Japanese troops crossing the Liao River from the south bank, appearing to be preparing to attack Tianzhuangtai. The situation in Tianzhuangtai is now extremely serious. (5) A commander Cai, claiming to be from the National Salvation and People's Defense Army, set up a checkpoint for defense at Wanjiawopu, in the Haicheng county jurisdiction. At 11 PM on the 22nd, five to six hundred Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived. Cai immediately gathered five to six hundred militiamen to resist them. Commander Xiang of Panshan County, upon hearing the news on the morning of the 23rd, urgently led four hundred militiamen to assist Cai. (6) On the evening of the 23rd, five to six hundred Japanese troops, carrying over ten artillery pieces, crossed the Liao River and advanced towards Panshan County. However, the river ice was thin and fragile, and they were struggling to advance across the ice. Their intention is to attack Tianzhuangtai and cut off our army's rear. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Telegrams and telephone lines from Xinmin and eastward have been completely cut off after 7 PM on the 23rd. The armored train fighting in Tianzhuangtai retreated to Duishan at 7 PM on the 23rd. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Yingkou The anti-Japanese actions of Chinese soldiers west of the Liao River are gradually worsening. The Japanese XX Regiment has decided to launch an attack, and orders were issued today for a certain unit to move in a certain direction. (23rd Telegraphic Communication Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's headquarters declared that Japanese troops bombarded Chinese armored trains at night in Tianzhuangtai. Chinese soldiers returned fire. The fighting was still in progress this afternoon. Bandits do not have armored trains, which the Japanese know very well, so this action cannot be justified as bandit suppression. (23rd Reuters)</p>
<p>Kaiyuan The Iwata XX unit, which advanced towards Tongjiangkou yesterday, clashed with several hundred cavalrymen from the Jinzhou Volunteer Army in front of Tongjiangkou. After a fierce battle, the cavalrymen were defeated, abandoning over twenty bodies and fleeing. The Japanese army suffered no casualties. At 2 PM, they entered the city of Tongjiangkou. The Iwata XX unit then linked up with a certain unit nearby to eliminate Chinese soldiers in the area before returning. (23rd Telegraphic Communication Agency)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Last night, approximately six hundred bandits were discovered inside Niuzhuang city, northwest of Haicheng. After a fierce battle with the Chinese Public Security Team, they occupied it. The Japanese Yingkou unit and the Haicheng field artillery immediately departed for the area. However, they are putting up stubborn resistance and not retreating slightly. The attack is still ongoing fiercely this morning. (23rd Telegraphic Communication Agency)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Today, all parties are being extremely secretive about the actions of the Japanese army. The Kwantung Army headquarters only stated that bandit suppression is underway. In the past 24 hours, the Japanese army has gradually advanced, getting closer to Jinzhou. Today, officials in Yingkou formally declared that the Japanese army has crossed the Liao River to the west and is now operating in the area where they suddenly withdrew troops weeks ago. However, the names of the cities and towns, as well as the units and destinations of the Japanese troops, are kept secret. Furthermore, Shenyang sources declared that the Japanese army began a large-scale offensive at dawn today, preparing to deliver a severe blow to the bandits and soldiers near Tianzhuangtai and west of Yingkou. However, the fighting units and the battle situation are also kept secret. Another communique from here stated that six hundred bandits appeared in Niuzhuang last night and captured the town. The Japanese Yingkou army and the Haicheng artillery have gone to Niuzhuang and began their attack at dawn today. Moreover, news from Kaiyuan stated that yesterday afternoon, Chinese troops south of Fakumen engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army for two hours. Fakumen was subsequently occupied by the Japanese army. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Continuing reports state that the Japanese army is currently engaged in a fierce battle with eight hundred Chinese cavalrymen at Longwangmiao.

<p>Ma Zhanshan</p>
<h3>Addresses Student Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Because various parties are dissatisfied with Ma Zhanshan's recruitment of student soldiers, Ma Zhanshan specially addressed the students who joined the army. Most of the young students are outstanding members of the nation. Although it feels worthwhile to sacrifice for resisting foreign aggression, it ultimately diminishes the nation's vitality. Moreover, what our army currently lacks is material, not manpower. Adding a unit of untrained young people does not significantly help the situation, and in case of failure, it may even affect the original army. As for my original intention to defend the country, I will never change it. I am currently waiting for orders from the central government. The people of the country should not have doubts about me. Ma Zhanshan will screen the students who have arrived in Hailun to join the army and accept those with strong determination. Those who continue to arrive will be given funds and sent back.

<h3>Preparing Important Proposals</h3>

(2) Based on the first principle, the people have the freedom to organize groups or political parties. (3) Shorten the period of political tutelage and enter the period of constitutional government. The method is: A. Establish a National Assembly Preparatory Committee within six months. B. The members of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee shall be elected by the people. C. The responsibilities of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, in addition to preparing various affairs, shall also include drafting the National Assembly representative election law and implementing regulations.

<p>(Nanjing) The Tan conversation and the two-day meeting have not yet discussed the grand national plan, and the rights of the people are not involved. This is regrettable. The national crisis is urgent, which everyone knows. The foundation of our party lies in the people. Members of the Nationalist Party bear the great responsibility of the country and should know this even more clearly. The way to save the country is to implement civil rights and mobilize the strength of the whole people to build everything on a foundation. Only then will it be easy to rectify domestic affairs and resist foreign aggression. The people of the country hope for this very much, and members of the Nationalist Party may not completely ignore it. However, up to now, there has been no practical manifestation of this, so how can we gather public opinion and jointly face the national crisis? The dangers ahead cannot be predicted. We are supporting civil rights, and we certainly do not want to go north to the Hu or south to the Yue. However, based on conscience, it is difficult to remain silent. We dare not slack off due to illness. () 23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Humble Contribution to the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee—Reforming Education</h3>
<p>Amidst the overall chaotic environment of militarist and bureaucratic politics, everything is disordered, backward, corrupt, and stagnant. Education cannot stand alone outside this chaotic state; this is an inevitable fact. From this, we can understand that the bankruptcy of our country's education and the increasing decline of culture in the past twenty years are evil consequences reaped under the evil environment of militarist and bureaucratic politics.</p>
<p>Today, when people talk about education, they often sigh and hate the young students, saying that students are inherently prone to causing trouble or that they are violent and untrainable. Especially since the past few months, stimulated by diplomatic issues, young students have stopped schooling to petition and demonstrate. Some people regard them as fierce floods and beasts, seeing this phenomenon as the evil fruit of twenty years of education, and they are eager to start rectifying education. Mr. Dai Jitao even made an urgent appeal to the entire education sector for national salvation to first seek the nation's lifeline, youth salvation to first save schools that teach the youth. The central government also plans to set up a special education committee for this reason. We sincerely cannot deny that today's education is bankrupt. At the same time, we cannot deny the passion and grief of today's youth, and that their unease in studying is a morbid state. We acknowledge that education should be rectified urgently and that youth should be saved urgently. However, we cannot agree to attribute all the crimes and faults to the youth, and even more, we cannot agree to not seeking out the root causes of educational bankruptcy, but rather increasing the ideological imprisonment of the youth. We believe that the responsibility for the bankruptcy of education should not be attributed to the students or youth, but to the entire society. Rectifying education should not further increase the youth's imprisonment; on the contrary, it should give the youth absolute freedom in thought and action, promote their vitality, open up the source of their thoughts, and make them lively and forward-looking, so as to reform and promote the entire society and the country.</p>
<p>Society is a large university, and the various aspects of society are practical teaching materials. However, what is society like today? What is the reality of society? Politicians are engaged in the pursuit of power and mired in the indulgence of private desires. All kinds of base, shameful, and incredible behaviors spread from individuals to the entire society, plunging the entire society into a chaotic state. Under this situation, the youth are influenced by what they see and hear and receive this kind of practical education. Those with unsound will are assimilated and thrown into the murky vortex, while those with strong will see the contradictions and irrationality of society and rise up to resist and strive for reform. On the one hand, politicians provide the youth with evil teaching materials through their actions, directly causing education to move towards destruction, while on the other hand, they want to save the fate of education through words, so that the youth can unanimously step into a bright and broad future. This is not only impossible but also increases the imprisonment of the youth, fundamentally cutting off a glimmer of hope for the future of the country and society, which is a very serious crime.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the schools themselves, the so-called sacred education sector has now been invaded by militarist and bureaucratic politics. University presidents often rely on military force as backing, and they compete and contend with all kinds of manipulative means. Holding multiple positions from afar has become a common practice. Teachers perfunctorily perform their duties, not regarding their work as a lifelong career, but currying favor with the authorities and currying favor with the students in order to secure their food and position, which is an undeniable fact. On the government's side, educational funding is often not issued but is diverted to other uses. The nation spends over 80% of its annual expenditure on military expenses, while educational funding, which is related to the foundation of the country, has no guarantee at all, forcing teachers to pawn their clothes to maintain their lives. This is a phenomenon unique to today's world. Under these circumstances, to blame the youth for not studying peacefully and to blame education for bearing evil fruits is truly understanding how to blame others but not understanding how to blame oneself, knowing the result but not knowing the cause. If politics cannot be clarified and the entire society cannot be reformed, then rectifying education and promoting culture are all empty talk.</p>
<p>We believe that if we want to talk about rectifying education today, from a negative perspective, we must determine and ensure the independence of educational funding, and under no circumstances can educational funding be diverted to other uses, so that those engaged in education will not be without rice to cook and constantly feel that their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient. Secondly, we must wash away the bad habits of relying on power, infighting, competition, holding multiple positions from afar, currying favor, and currying favor in the education sector, so that those engaged in education must be experts, their lives must be guaranteed, and they can concentrate on their work with peace of mind. As for the positive aspect, the figures on the political stage and the general social leaders should urgently correct their own behavior and establish a model for the youth. In particular, they should excavate the foundation of militarist and bureaucratic politics so that politics can be clarified, society can be stabilized, and everything can be brought into a rational and correct orbit. Again, the youth must be given absolute freedom in thought and scholarship so that they can accept the new trends and new theories of the world and so that the vitality of their lives can be freely developed to promote culture and reform society.</p>
<p>We believe that education is not the rigid application of mechanical education, nor is it a fixed action like operating a machine. We believe that education is the superstructure of society, and to rectify education, we must first stabilize the entire society. We believe that the purpose of education is to promote society and increase the well-being of mankind, not to preserve the status quo and make mankind long suffer in the depths of misery. We believe that education is living, dynamic, and forward-looking, not dead, conventional, and stagnant. Only by understanding this can we talk about education, and only by understanding this can we talk about rectifying education.</p>

<h3>Russo-French Border Protection Treaty</h3>

<p>Diplomatic Negotiations Between the Two Countries Worth Watching</p>
<p>Moscow Telegram from Guomin News Agency on the 22nd: Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and the French Ambassador to Russia, Mr. Jing, met for a long time today. At the time, the Paris Echo had just revealed the contents of the newly signed Russo-French Border Protection Treaty, which made this meeting highly regarded by the outside world. No announcement was made after the meeting between the two, but it is known that the topic of discussion was nothing more than the Border Protection Treaty. The initial signing of this treaty was on August 14th in Paris. After it was leaked by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russian officials were somewhat alarmed. At the moment, Russian diplomatic circles are saying that the Paris Echo's disclosure is not entirely the same as the original text, and that the part concerning relations between Russia and Poland is particularly inaccurate.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Over Six Hundred Members in Attendance</p>
<p>Discussing the Guiding Principles for Future Governance</p>
<p>Situation in Eastern Provinces Increasingly Perilous</p>
<p>Molotov Criticizes the League of Nations</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 22nd – The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, with over six hundred members,</p>
<p>will gather tonight in the resplendent ballroom of the Grand Kremlin Palace for the opening ceremony. The committee's main function is to approve government achievements, possessing limited real power, but its political and moral influence is significant, akin to that of a parliament in other countries. Government officials will report on the political situation, followed by discussions within the committee. The reports are expected to be unanimously approved, but the sentiments expressed by the committee will serve as a guiding principle for governance in the coming months. Tonight, the presidium will consist of seven chairpersons, with Kalinin representing the Russian Federation. The other six federal chairpersons will take turns presiding over the meetings. The Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov, whose position is equivalent to that of a prime minister, will be seated alongside other government leaders on the presidium. At the other end will be diplomatic personnel and foreign correspondents attending as observers, numbering twenty-five. Apart from the National Congress of Soviets, this committee is considered the most representative national assembly. Many members will attend in their native attire, displaying a diverse and colorful array of garments. There will be many women. The Central Executive Committee was elected by the National Congress of Soviets in March of this year, divided into two groups: one being the Union Council, comprising four hundred and sixty-nine members, elected according to population; the other being the Council of Nationalities, comprising one hundred and thirty-eight members, representing each republic, regardless of territory or population. The two councils will hold a joint session tonight, and thereafter will convene separately. National News Agency, Moscow, 22nd – The Premier of the Soviet Russian Federation, Molotov, made a statement today at the Central Executive Committee, ridiculing the League of Nations' pretense of seeking a solution to the Manchurian Incident. Molotov's speech was delivered in the presence of diplomatic representatives from various countries stationed in Russia. His words were firm, and the audience erupted in applause, making his remarks particularly significant. Molotov vehemently denied that the international community had taken any action to mitigate the disaster of the Manchurian Incident. Molotov further stated that the organization not only failed to alleviate the disaster but also exacerbated the situation in Manchuria. "We initially had low expectations, but we did not anticipate the effects would be so dire," he said. Molotov expressed pessimism about the upcoming disarmament conference next year, stating that it would be nothing more than a gathering of major powers, aiming not to reduce armaments but to expand them.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 22nd – At the annual meeting of the Soviet Union's Central Executive Committee held in the Kremlin Palace tonight, the fear of war in the Far East was also mentioned. Before Chairman Petrovsky delivered the opening remarks and welcomed the representatives, Stalin suddenly appeared on the podium, triggering a thunderous ovation that lasted five minutes. Petrovsky then continued his speech, detailing the achievements of the first three years of the Five-Year Plan and the proposed undertakings for the next two years. He stated that as Soviet Russia embarked on industrial and agricultural progress and recruited millions of new workers for social construction, the middle class was collapsing. "Today, we only see the capitalist nations gradually approaching their demise, with the living standards of their workers declining daily. Therefore, they are desperately competing for world markets. As their interests clash, they are preparing for imperialist wars – a war in the Far East, a war against Russia." At this point, Petrovsky's tone became increasingly severe as he addressed the diplomatic corps, stating, "Soviet Russia is fully prepared to defend against all attacks. The Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party will lead the people to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years." After Petrovsky's speech, the Executive Committee unanimously approved the agenda, which focused on economic matters and, in particular, plans for the coming year.</p>

<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd – A group of executives from the Japan Labor-Farmer Mass Party, including Hisashi Asō and Juichō Miwa, visited Prime Minister Inukai in the morning at 11:00 AM as representatives of the party. Citing the economic crisis and the Manchurian Incident, they expressed strong opposition to the Sixtieth Diet's imperialist policies, which would increase the burden on the proletariat, and demanded immediate dissolution of the Diet. Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd – An announcement was made today stating that the Diet is scheduled to formally convene on December 26th. However, the business on that day will be purely formal, and the session will adjourn for the year-end holidays on the 27th, reconvening on January 21st. At that time, fierce debates are expected. If the government does not dissolve the Diet, significant events are anticipated. There is much speculation in political circles regarding the dissolution issue, but the general consensus is that the current government will not collapse. Both major parties in the House of Representatives, in light of the domestic and international situation, wish to avoid dissolution of the Diet. There are proposals to form a special body consisting of key figures from both parties to ensure the successful implementation of national policies and avoid the need to appeal to the people.</p>

<h3>Renowned Library Collapses</h3>
<p>Loss of Books and Artworks Beyond Estimation</p>
<p>Five Librarians Buried in the Rubble</p>
<p>Weak Wall Support Leads to Disaster</p>
<p>National News, Rome, 22nd – Today, a portion of the roof of the Vatican Library in the Holy City suddenly collapsed. It was dusk, and readers had not yet left. Cracks appeared in the upper roof, causing those who saw them to scream and rush for the doors. However, five librarians were unable to escape and were buried beneath over twenty thousand volumes. It is not yet known if any readers were among the victims. The sudden incident was as loud as thunder, and the entire Holy City heard it, expressing shock and grief. The cause of the disaster is attributed to the numerous steel bookshelves recently donated to the library by the United States. Initially, the Pope, upon receiving the donation, was concerned that the aging structure might not be able to bear the weight of the bookshelves. Therefore, he commissioned workers to reinforce it. However, the foundation of that section of the building was not strong enough, leading to this tragedy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vatican City, 22nd – A large portion of the world-renowned Vatican Library collapsed this afternoon. The fire brigade is currently working valiantly to search for people buried in the rubble. The library houses many precious artworks and some of the world's most valuable manuscripts, making the loss inestimable. At least ten thousand volumes of books are buried in the rubble, about a quarter of the library's collection. It is believed that those buried are students working at the library. Rescue teams are now digging through bricks and tiles to rescue the trapped individuals. The collapsed portion is the three-story wing on the right. First, the pointed roof and a large portion of the murals collapsed inward, and the two-story building below was crushed and collapsed as well. Fortunately, most of the staff and repair workers had already left, otherwise the death toll would have been much higher. The collapse was accompanied by a thunderous sound, and dust filled the sky. Tonight, the Vatican issued a statement saying that after inspecting the workers, none were injured, but students may have been harmed. The workers were working on the lowest level, repairing the walls. It is believed that the walls collapsed due to structural failure, causing the building to collapse. Although the library suffered significant damage in this accident, some books are expected to be intact. However, many treasures, such as murals, are irretrievably lost. The library was built in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V, and the walls and ceilings were painted by famous artists of the time. Vatican officials are currently on-site directing rescue efforts. It is said that the Pope had just left the library when the roof collapsed, only ten minutes earlier. Upon hearing that students were buried, the Pope knelt in prayer and personally visited the site. Reuters, Vatican City, 23rd – The bodies of Professor Fatazi and two workers were recovered from the library rubble overnight. It is feared that there are two or three more bodies. The upper level was the Hall of the Hundred Days, with walls painted by famous artists. Fortunately, it remains intact. The room contains items gifted by emperors and celebrities throughout history. A porcelain basin gifted by Napoleon was broken. The lower level was the consultation room, housing fifteen thousand paintings and extremely valuable texts, most of which are expected to be salvaged.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Decides to Attack Jinzhou</h3>
<p>Vanguard Forces Pressing on Liuhugou</p>
<p>New Fortifications Being Built at Juluhe</p>
<p>Aircraft Factory Under Construction in Xinmin County</p>
<p>Shenyang Communication: Since the anti-Japanese greenwoodsman White Dragon's unsuccessful attack on Shenyang on November 29th, the Japanese troops stationed in Qianjinzhai (i.e., Fushun) and Hicheng's Domon Unit have been transferred upon Benjo Shigeru's order. They are stationed in Tang Yulin's residence on the Third Jinglu Road in the commercial district, as well as the agricultural and forestry school in the industrial area. On the 15th, a regiment marched to the Huanggu Tun railway station, and boarded the Beining train westward. Around 12:00 AM on the 16th, the Japanese army transported multiple boxes of ammunition and military supplies to the Huanggu Tun station from the Shenyang South Manchuria Railway station using several trucks, filling an entire train, and transporting them to the front lines. Moreover, gun emplacements were constructed on both the east and west banks of the Juluhe, and defensive fortifications were built nearby. Iron netting was also installed outside the station, with sandbags piled up. The plan is to have one regiment of the Suzuki Brigade, withdrawn from Heilongjiang earlier, serve as the vanguard force attacking Jinzhou. They are now pressing near Liuhugou. In addition, armored train units and air force units have also been dispatched to Xinmin. Currently, Japanese soldiers in Xinmin include a cavalry company (company commander) stationed in the Shi He Xing Grain Store, and infantry companies stationed in the Tongshengyuan and Xinmao Freight Stores (company commander). An engineer platoon is stationed in the Ri Chang Store. Furthermore, military police and infantry are stationed inside the station and next to the Meifu Petroleum Company to the southeast of the station, their numbers unknown. The Suzuki Brigade's headquarters, stationed in Dongdaying, Shenyang, is also preparing to depart. The Japanese air force units stationed in Shenyang have been practicing dropping bombs in various locations outside the Northeast Bianmen, including Muchangdong, Yangjiatun, Shimiaozi, and Dongling, causing great alarm among nearby residents. Their plan to attack Jinzhou has been in preparation for a long time and will surely be realized soon. Our forces in the Goubangzi, Dahu Mountain, Daling River, Jinzhou, and Tongliao areas include Sun Lianzhong's 囗囗 Brigade, Zhang Tingfu's 囗囗 Brigade, Chang Jingwu's 囗囗 Brigade, and Zhang Shusheng's cavalry brigade, totaling approximately 40,000 men. Currently, the situation between the Chinese and Japanese forces in the Jinzhou area is as depicted in the diagram above. (　)</p>
<h3>Japan Plots to Buy the CER</h3>
<p>France Sells CER Shares</p>
<p>Japan Secretly Seeks to Acquire</p>
<p>Russia States It Cannot Recognize</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: The secret compromise between France and Japan to jointly conspire against us has become an undeniable fact in recent events. Although the French troops are approaching the border of Guangdong, there have been no special movements. However, the news that Japan is accepting French shares in the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) with the intention of buying the CER has become the most sensational piece of news here. According to local White Russian newspapers, the contract for the construction of the CER was signed between China and the Sino-Russian Bank (i.e., the Russo-Asiatic Bank). After the Russian Revolution, the majority of the Russo-Asiatic Bank's shares fell into the hands of France, some purchased by France, and some sold by Russians in the Meili market. In this way, the rights of the Russo-Asiatic Bank belong to France. The CER's railway property guarantees the Russo-Asiatic Bank's loans and serves as a commercial organization protecting French interests. In 1920, a new contract emerged between China and the Russo-Asiatic Bank. Since 1921, the Russo-Asiatic Bank has effectively become the owner of the CER's property. This was also recorded in the minutes of the Washington Conference that year. During the conference, Japan was entrusted to protect the rights of European countries in the CER. However, in 1924, the Feng-Soviet Agreement was reached, and Soviet Russia began jointly managing the CER with China, becoming a part-owner of the CER. All responsibilities to third parties were borne by the Soviet side. The Moscow Soviet government does not recognize any rights of France in the CER. At that time, Radkin, the Soviet Consul-General in Liaoning, issued a statement declaring that the CER shares were fictitious and that the railway belonged to the Russian Empire. The rights were accepted by the Soviet government and jointly owned with China. The Moscow government does not recognize any rights of France or any other third country in the CER. These expressions from the Russian consulate represent the opinion of its government. Therefore, since Soviet Russia and China jointly managed the railway, the rights of the Russo-Asiatic Bank completely disappeared. The bank subsequently went bankrupt. France and other countries that signed the Washington Conference protested to the Moscow government regarding this statement from the Soviet Union, especially France, which protested the most vehemently. However, due to inconsistent international circumstances at the time, the protests were unsuccessful, up until now. France has once again raised its rights in the CER. Influential newspapers in Paris have also published numerous articles discussing France's interests in the CER, advocating for France to take further actions to protect its rights. Financial and social circles have sent numerous letters to newspapers, calling for the restoration of France's rights in the CER. The French Consul, Lina, stationed in Harbin, was ordered by his government to make a detailed report on the current situation of the CER and the Sino-Russian cooperation. It is said that the French Consul stationed in Liaoning recently passed through Harbin on his way back to his country, which is related to this matter. Recently, French Consul Lina and Japanese Consul-General Tadaichi Ohashi met in Harbin, holding close discussions. Some say it was for this matter. However, the Soviet side does not acknowledge this, stating that even if France takes such actions, the Soviet Union will never recognize them as valid because the Soviet Union has long declared that the CER is jointly managed by China and Russia. Whether the shares scattered abroad are numerous or few, they have long ceased to be related to the railway. Russian Consul in Harbin, Bulunov, personally stated to the Harbin authorities yesterday that the Soviet Union cannot listen to the transfer of the CER. It is heard that the French side wants to sell the Harbin-Changchun line shares of the CER, while the Japanese side wants to obtain the Harbin-Changchun and Harbin-Manzhouli line shares, so they are still in negotiations.

<h3>Xi Qia Sends Personnel to Resolve the Wannbaoshan Incident</h3>
<p>Overseen by the Pseudo-Changchun County Magistrate Zhao Rumei</p>
<p>With Japanese Participation, Led by Mr. Kuramoto, Staff Member of the Changchun Consulate</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: Since the Wannbaoshan Incident occurred on July 2nd, five months have passed in the blink of an eye. The Japanese invasion of our Northeast was essentially initiated by the Wannbaoshan Incident. Zhong Yu, the special envoy of the former Kuomintang Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jilin, held negotiations with the Japanese Consul-General in Jilin, Ishimachi, in Jilin. However, due to the Japanese side's lack of sincerity, the negotiations came to a standstill. After the September 18th Incident occurred, the case was indefinitely shelved. Now, the Japanese believe that in this military occupation situation, if they use the puppet government of Jilin as the negotiating counterpart, they will be able to obtain the greatest benefits through negotiations. Therefore, they instructed Xi Qia, the pseudo-governor of Jilin, to order Jin Bi-dong, the chief of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, to negotiate with the Japanese side in Changchun. In reality, this kind of negotiation is merely a formality. Of course, all conditions will comply with the Japanese side's intentions, so that the Japanese can obtain more practical guarantees for their rights to reside and lease land in our country's interior. It is heard that Jin Bi-dong has ordered Zhao Rumei, the pseudo-Changchun County Magistrate, to negotiate with the Japanese side. Mr. Tashiro, the Japanese Consul in Changchun, has also sent Kuramoto Hideaki, a staff member of the consulate, to meet with Zhao. The two sides have met twice and are expected to resolve the issue soon. The Wannbaoshan Incident, which the whole country strived to fight for, will be easily dismissed by these people. However, according to rumors, Zhao Rumei believes that this case is of great importance. Although he has accepted the pseudo-order to negotiate, he is feigning compliance. Therefore, Kuramoto Hideaki has visited several times but has not been able to meet him. Is it possible that he still has a conscience? (17th)</p>
<h3>After the Taiyuan Petition Tragedy</h3>
<p>Industry and Commerce Halt Operations to Aid Students</p>
<p>School Principals Request Punishment of Responsible Personnel</p>
<p>Taiyuan dispatch: The Shanxi Provincial Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, along with students from various schools, gathered at the Provincial Party Headquarters the day before yesterday (the 18th) to petition. They were shot at by the Party Headquarters' disciplinary team, leading to a tragic incident. Yesterday (the 19th) at 10:00 AM, all shops in the provincial capital closed down in solidarity with the students. Since the incident, the garrison headquarters has intensified surveillance of Party Headquarters personnel. The previous night, the 6th Company of the 400th Regiment was dispatched to garrison the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the 8th Company was dispatched to garrison the Municipal Party Headquarters. Liu Pingshun, the company commander of the 6th Company, stationed his troops in various departments and sections of the Party Headquarters, and detained 51 internal staff members in a room to prevent them from fleeing. However, the staff of the Municipal Party Headquarters all fled yesterday. According to investigations yesterday morning, the number of injured students has increased again, with several having their spines broken, potentially leading to disability. Two students, a Mr. Li from No. 1 Middle School and a Mr. Zhang from a mountain school, remain missing. After the Student Union reported this to the Public Security Bureau, Director Wang Xifu, along with Section Chief Yang of the 3rd Section and Bureau Officer Qiao from the 4th Branch of the Bureau, and two representatives from the Student Union, led police officers to the Provincial Party Headquarters at 9:00 AM yesterday to search the wells. They only recovered two willow dippers. To investigate the perpetrators, the Student Union has stationed disciplinary teams at each city gate since yesterday to strictly check for wanted criminals. They have also deployed personnel at train and bus stations to prevent escapes. They will cooperate with the police and military police to conduct household registrations and search for criminals within the next few days. Personnel have also been stationed in front of the Pu Xin Bookstore. It has been decided that a memorial service for Mu Guangzheng will be held at Zhongshan Park at 1:00 PM this afternoon (the 20th). Workers will cease work for one day, and newspapers will suspend publication for one day. Yesterday morning, principals of secondary and higher schools held a meeting at Shanxi University to discuss measures to assist regarding this tragedy. They immediately drafted two petitions to be submitted to the Provincial Government, expressing their opinions. The petitions are recorded below: (1) Upon investigation, the student anti-Japanese national salvation movement has occurred in this province following the events in Beiping, Shanghai, and Wuhan. At that time, the principals followed the orders of the Central Government and the government to try to stop it, but unfortunately, the youth of the city, motivated by righteous indignation, were temporarily unsuccessful, resulting in the events of the 11th of this month. The principals are responsible for their duties and bear the blame. They are continuing to persuade and find ways to resume classes, but yesterday there was a sudden unprecedented tragedy in this city. The important goal of the Student Union's Anti-Japanese Association's petition is to remove the Director of Education, Miao. At this time, Director Miao should personally avoid taking action, and the government should present this matter to the Central Government and resolve it as soon as possible to avoid further unpredictable events. The principals are worried and cannot remain silent. In addition to continuing to stop the students, they should jointly submit a written request for review and implementation. (2) The student patriotic movement in this province followed the national movement, resulting in a conflict with the education authorities. The principals have repeatedly tried to stop it before and after the fact, but they were powerless and things went against their wishes, resulting in the tragic killing incident on the 18th of this month. The principals deeply regret the situation. However, this incident involved students who are ignorant youths, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, and there were no excessive actions. However, representatives were beaten and the masses were bombed, resulting in several deaths and injuries. This kind of brutal behavior deserves punishment. The government should swiftly transfer the perpetrators to the court for strict punishment according to the law, in order to comfort the young people who died unjustly. (December 20th)</p>
<p>Another dispatch from Taiyuan: Yesterday (the 18th), the Student Union Anti-Japanese Association held a large anti-Japanese propaganda rally in Zhongshan Park. Approximately 3,000 students attended. Disciplinary teams formed by famous schools all carried wooden sticks. The garrison troops and public security bureau's security team were also present to suppress the rally. After representatives from various schools spoke about the violent occupation of Northeast China by Japan and the current turmoil in this province, they formed a procession to march. At the same time, approximately 500 workers from the Huochai Company, Jinsheng Factory, and Pingmin Factory gathered on Jingying Street, also carrying wooden sticks and shouting slogans. These workers were directed by the Provincial Party Headquarters and almost clashed with the students. However, because there were many people from all sides, they were mutually persuaded. After the unfortunate incident, the Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters sent troops to protect the area. Around 12:00 PM, all the students went to the Provincial Party Headquarters to petition, demanding that a telegram be sent to the Central Government to dismiss and punish Director of Education Miao Peicheng, and to support the students in rising up to resist Japan. At that time, they shouted slogans such as "Support Wang Jingwei," "Down with Japanese Imperialism," "Down with the Communist Party," and "Down with Miao Peicheng, who obstructs the Anti-Japanese Movement." Upon hearing the news, the Provincial Party Headquarters mobilized the disciplinary team and the militia formed by various officials of the Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters, using live ammunition to block the main gate, preventing the students from entering. After tens of minutes of arguing, a certain regimental commander maintaining order smoothed things over with a member of the Provincial Executive Committee, who sent more than 20 representatives to enter. After the representatives entered the gate, they saw that the disciplinary team and the militia of the Provincial Party Headquarters were fully armed, lined up on both sides, with guns and wooden sticks arranged like a dense forest, creating a sense of fear. They went to the conference room, where Han Kewen, Yao Dahai, Su Shouyu, and Li Min received them. The representatives stated the purpose of their petition. Han and others said that it could not be decided by a few people and would be answered after an emergency meeting was convened to discuss it. The representatives left and informed all the students. Everyone believed that the reply was not to the point and asked the representatives to negotiate again. After the representatives entered the second time, they saw that everything was different from before. The conference room's doorway and windows were completely surrounded by disciplinary teams, creating a solemn atmosphere. After the representatives entered the conference room, the four committee members, Han and the others, left. Two minutes later, the disciplinary team and the militia burst in. The representatives, seeing that the situation was not good, intended to reason with them, but gunshots and wooden sticks were heard in succession. The representatives were unable to avoid them and had nowhere to hide. Fortunately, Su Shouyu entered the room and ordered the disciplinary team to stop. The representatives were about to take the opportunity to withdraw, but after walking about a dozen steps, the disciplinary team in front blocked the way, and the disciplinary team behind chased after them. The militia on the east and west sides also crowded in from the sides. Because the gate was locked, the representatives could not escape, and gunshots and wooden sticks fell like wind and rain. As the representatives retreated into the conference room, the disciplinary team and the militia chased them on all sides. This happened three times. The disciplinary team also chased</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The representatives huddled at the gate, and saw a small hole in the wooden door on the side, through which one could enter and exit. Therefore, they urgently crawled out through this door. However, because the hole was as small as a bottle, it took several minutes to escape one person. As a result, more than 20 representatives were beaten by wooden sticks and almost none escaped unscathed. When the entire student body heard the news, they swarmed forward, shouting to hit, and threw stones randomly, hoping to break through the door to rescue the representatives. However, the disciplinary team guarding the gate immediately opened fire. Gunshots rang out, and the students all fled to the entrance of the Grain Bureau to Shang Xiao. Nearby residents were also panicked. After the garrison commander heard the report, he led three battalions of garrison troops to suppress the situation, and at the students' request, completely disarmed the disciplinary team and militia, confiscating a total of 58 rifles, 12 submachine guns, and 3 pistols. Subsequently, the Provincial Executive Committee members Han, Yao Dahai, Su Shouyu, and Li Min, and the militia were escorted to the garrison headquarters by car. The disarmed disciplinary team was sent to the 10th Gendarmerie Team. The Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters were closed that night by the garrison commander, gendarmerie, and public security bureau, and a battalion of troops was stationed inside.

<h3>Guangzhou Students Petition to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Five Requests to the Guangdong Government Accepted</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Because the provincial five schools recently petitioned the government to send troops, but did not get satisfactory results, the student community convened the entire city's students again on the 17th to hold a large petition. On that day, students from various schools gathered in the Yuexiu Sports Field one after another, beginning at 10 a.m. Participants included students from Lingnan University, National University, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou University, School of Law, School of Political Science and Law, Zhiyong Middle School, Girls' Middle School, Guanghua Middle School, Panyu Normal School, Pui Ching Middle School, First Middle School, Dazhong Middle School, Dongshan Middle School, Municipal Women's Vocational School, Kunwei Girls' School, Zhixing Middle School, Lingqiao Girls' School, Journalism School, Municipal First Middle School, Provincial Second Middle School, Physical Education School, Nanjing Middle School, Shiyan Middle School, Women's Normal School, Nursing School, Pui To, Pui Ying, Municipal Second Middle School, Xinghua School, Jiaozhong Normal School, Zhongkai School, Zhixin School, Guanghan School, Tuqiang School, Guanghua Medical School, Municipal Art School, First Normal School, Shiyan Middle School, Baosheng School, etc., totaling over 10,000 students. At noon, they lined up and went to the National Government. Chen Wenzao, a representative from Sun Yat-sen University, served as the temporary student commander. Upon arriving in front of the National Government, Chen Wenzao and eight others were elected as representatives to submit a petition with five requests: (1) Please appoint a general supervisor of student volunteer military training for the entire city immediately, and issue firearms and personnel to train rescue teams in various schools, and issue protective supplies. (2) Please send troops to recover lost territory immediately. (3) Please send a Guangdong Central Committee member north immediately to organize a unified government. (4) Please issue a clear order to allow absolute freedom for the student national salvation movement. (5) Please investigate and handle the officials who ordered the guards to shoot and kill the petitioning students from the five provincial schools, take photos of the officials, and publish apologies in newspapers in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shanghai. Xiang Hanping received the representatives. Xiang's reply was as follows: "The National Government is currently planning to appoint He Tong as the general supervisor of student training. Students who are well-trained can be issued guns immediately. If they have not been trained, they must wait for six months of training before they can be issued weapons. As for the current situation, troops can only be sent to resist Japan after a unified government is established. The government can approve the other requests." The students replied verbally, and still demanded that the above five points be answered in writing. Xiang then entered the National Government and consulted with the authorities, immediately convening a meeting to discuss it. At 2:00 p.m., Xiang came out again and gave the students a written reply to the five requests as follows: (1) He Tong is appointed as the general supervisor of the Guangzhou city student military training. After the New Year's Day general review of the student volunteer military forces in the city, firearms will be issued separately within a week. Before New Year's Day, personnel will be dispatched separately to train rescue teams in various schools and issue protective supplies. (2) Immediately mobilize all armies and prepare to set off, and ask representatives of each school to go to Nanjing to petition first, and allow our army to pass. If there is no response, send a telegram to Guangdong requesting that troops be sent immediately. If the National Government still fails to send troops at that time, students can overthrow the Guangdong government. (3) All members of the Central Committee will go to Hong Kong on the 17th and transfer to Shanghai by ship on the 18th to go to Nanjing to organize a unified government. (4) A clear order will be announced before the 19th. (5) By the 20th of this month at the latest, an order will be issued to dismiss the officials who insulted the students, take photos of the officials, and publish apologies in newspapers in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shanghai. The students were satisfied and temporarily moved that the government allocate travel expenses for student representatives if they went north. Xiang agreed to ask the government to allocate them. At this point, the student representatives began to shout slogans and withdrew. It was already 5:00 p.m. (December 27th)</p>
<h3>Jinan Petitioning Students Return</h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: The Jinan City students petitioning delegation to Beijing (2,572 students from 13 schools) returned north from Pukou by two trains on the morning of the 18th and arrived in Jinan this morning (the 20th). Students and faculty members from various schools who stayed behind came to the station to welcome them. Various labor unions also sent representatives in teams holding flags to express their welcome. The Department of Education, the Municipal Government, and the Public Security Bureau also sent personnel to the station to take care of the situation. At 9:30 a.m., the first train arrived at the station carrying students from high schools and Yuying schools. At 10:30 a.m., the second train arrived carrying students from the remaining ten schools. The entire group lined up to get off the train. The delegation, holding flags, led the way, and the rest followed in order on the platform. According to delegation standing committee member Li Xiujie, when talking to reporters, the delegation initially believed that this movement was extremely significant, but when students from various places held a general demonstration in Beijing on the 17th, due to the complexity of the elements, the resolution of the general assembly of representatives was overturned. Therefore, the Jinan students did not participate in the general demonstration that day, not out of greed for life or fear of death, but because Chairman Jiang had stepped down and the government had no officially responsible person, so bloodshed was not worth it. However, as soon as they heard about the tragedy that day, they immediately sent a team to help, resulting in the arrest of two people (Li Henian from the First Rural Normal School and Fu Weiya from the First Vocational School, who have now been bailed out). The students felt that petitioning the government was meaningless, so they decided to return to Jinan to do their best to awaken the mass movement and universally spread anti-Japanese national salvation. This ambition and this heart will never slacken and cannot be dispelled by any force. The delegation had a total of three thousand five hundred and seventy-two people when it left, more than ten people became ill on the way, more than one hundred were persuaded to return by the principals to Beijing, and two were arrested. Today, three thousand two hundred and ninety-seven people returned to Jinan. At 11:00 a.m., Labor Union representative Yan Tianle delivered a welcoming speech to the students. Student representative Li Huanlun delivered a reply. After the speeches, they shouted slogans, formed a procession, and left the station to parade. The propaganda team led the way, distributing propaganda. They marched southeast from the Jinpu Station, passing through Dama Road, turning south, passing through Jingwei First Road, turning east to Erma Road, entering Puli Gate, passing through Puli Street, Guyi Market Street, to Daxi Gate, passing through Ximen Dajie, turning north, passing through Anchasi Street, turning east to the Department of Education. Because it was Sunday, no one was there to meet them. They also went to the Provincial Party Headquarters, but no one was there to meet them because it was Sunday, so they all dispersed and returned to their schools. (December 20th)</p>
<h3>Niu Yongjian Resigns as Minister of Personnel</h3>
<p>Niu Yongjian, Minister of Personnel, submitted a report to the National Government, stating: "I, Yongjian, was originally a scholar. In the late Qing Dynasty, seeing the decline of the country, I abandoned literature and learned martial arts, determined to devote myself to the revolution. Following the pioneers, I devoted myself to military affairs for more than thirty years, daring not to slacken. Since the National Revolutionary Army established the capital, I have been favored by the Party and the country and have held important civil posts. After several years of following the routine, I know that I have made mistakes. I had long ago made the decision to retire. I was repeatedly retained by clear orders, and it was a time of national crisis, so I did not dare to ask to return. Now, the violent Japanese are showing their ferocity and occupying our three provinces without cause. The whole country is rushing to face the difficulties. Our cooperation has promoted unity, which has been realized. I, Yongjian, am accustomed to military life, and have long prepared for military service. I was not cut out for politics, and offering my services was my original intention. At this time when the national policy has been set and the threat of invasion has not ceased, it is not appropriate to hold a position without performing my duties and going against my heart. I dare to express my feelings and earnestly request that you approve my resignation from the current position as Minister of Personnel, so that I may devote my modest efforts to the work of resisting foreign aggression. If the Party and the country believe that there is still a place where Yongjian can be of service, whether at the front or in the rear, I am willing to defend the country with a weapon in hand and dare not refuse any difficulty. I humbly submit this report and await your orders."</p>

<p>The theft case is suspected and sent to court. Regarding the theft at Zhou Bosheng's house in Ta Qi Tu, within the jurisdiction of the 11th Sub-station on the night of the 11th of this month, it was reported to the police on the 18th by the victim, Zhou Bosheng, that a suspect in the theft case, Ji Sitang, was identified by the wife of a resident, Ren Size, and handed over to the Sijing Public Security Sub-bureau. After questioning Ji Sitang, Zhou stated that on the night of the theft, seven or eight people who sounded like guests entered the house at 7 p.m. The ninth person was Ji Sitang, who was arrested. Ji Sitang did not say a word when he entered, but Zhou clearly identified him. Yesterday, when Zhou was shopping in Sijing, he recognized the person, so he handed him over to the police. Ji Sitang stated that he lived in Zhao Shitu and was currently working for Shen Maosheng. He joined the store in August. Yesterday, he was arrested by the woman for no reason. His brother, Zhu Huanrong, submitted a statement to defend him, but it did not match Ji Sitang's statement. Since the case involves robbery, Ji Sitang and Zhou Bosheng were sent to the county government and then to the county court for trial.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The party affairs dispute expands. Following the incident where the doors, windows, tables, and chairs of the Wuxi County Party Headquarters were mostly destroyed, the situation has become increasingly serious. Unexpectedly, at 4 p.m. that afternoon, Ji Pu, a former member of the county party committee who had already resigned, and Gan Ciqing, a secretary, took the county police team and the Public Security Bureau's special police to arrest people in various places. Then, at the First District Party Headquarters, Mao Junbai, Zhu Zuyin, Yao Xinchui, Hua Meixuan, Qian Disheng, Chen Mengqi, and six other members of the Party Affairs Improvement Association were escorted to the county government. The crowd was panicked. The various district branches held an emergency meeting and more than 100 party members, along with Li Tiping, a member of the Standing Committee of the County Party Headquarters, and Gan Nianqing, a member of the Executive Committee, petitioned the county government, demanding the release of all arrested party members. This continued until 3 a.m. this morning (23), when Mao Junbai and the other six were released. However, this case has just been resolved, and some people are involved in the recently established Federation of Trade Unions, secretly plotting to resist, and it cannot be completely resolved. Li Tiping, a member of the Standing Committee of the County Party Headquarters, believes that the recent disputes within the party are deeply troubling and yesterday telegraphed the Provincial Party Headquarters requesting his resignation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Qian Nanyun's rape case opens for trial. Qian Nanyun, the principal of the Qingyang Temple Elementary School in the 11th district, was reported for raping Liu Xiufeng, a 12-year-old female student at the school, by her father, Liu Guifang, to the Qingyang Public Security Second Branch and sent to the General Bureau for transfer to the county for trial. Qian was detained in the Public Security Bureau Detention Center. Because his cotton pants and lining pants had semen stains, he was exchanged with Huang Qi, a police officer on duty, but was noticed by a patrol officer, who presented the pants to the county. After Qian was sent to the county, he took the opportunity to urinate and tried to escape by climbing the wall. The judicial police reported to the county. At 4 p.m., Magistrate Ma conducted a secret trial. First, Liu Guifang explained the process, and then Liu Qifeng was interrogated, who stated that she had been raped by Mr. Qian Nanyun, causing a lot of bleeding in her lower body. Qian Nanyun stated that he graduated from the Third Normal School in the 17th year and had been the principal of the Miaoqian Elementary School for two years. There were 38 male students and 5 female students. Each semester there were 100 yuan for tuition and board. He went home on Thursday, and the blood on his pants was caused by his wife's menstruation. He did not admit to raping Xiufeng and did not admit to trying to escape out of fear of crime. Then Liu Xiufeng confronted him to prove it. Qian was evasive. Magistrate Ma carefully examined the diagnosis from Fuyin Hospital. Xiufeng had injuries, tears in the vulva, perineum, and vaginal opening, and the hymen was also torn. There was no bleeding at the present time and it did not endanger her life. Based on the above evidence, Qian's rape of the female student was undeniable. After the interrogation, his wife, Hu, was brought in for questioning, but the answers did not match. When asked by the interrogator, Qian admitted to the rape and asked for a lenient sentence. After the interrogation, he was taken into custody pending sentencing.</p>
<p>Negotiation on occupation of civilian land for the automobile road. After the Xicheng long-distance automobile road was opened, the Construction Bureau has not yet measured the land price tax for the occupation of civilian land. The Finance Bureau has exempted the tax. The township heads and deputies of Qinnan Township held a meeting the other day. Yin Xi Shen proposed that no price had been given for the occupation of civilian land, and the land price tax was still paid by the original owner. What kind of negotiation should be adopted? (1) The district head of the district should send a letter to the Construction Bureau and the Automobile Company, stating that before the government has completed the procedures for issuing the land price and exempting the land price tax, the automobile should be temporarily suspended to prevent accidents. (2) The landowners should contact each other and organize a negotiation committee. (3) The township heads, deputies, and township affairs council secretaries along the route should be the negotiators.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Promotion Association Branch Established. Wang Jingwei issued a telegram advocating the convocation of a National Salvation Conference, and each province should establish a National Salvation Conference. Jiangyin County has established a Jiangyin Branch of the Jiangsu Promotion Association. Xu Yunting is preparing for the establishment.

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Fire at Shanghai Hoji Match Factory. The former Zhensheng Electric Light Factory near Huangxing outside Xiaonanmen in Wuyi was leased to the Shanghai Hoji Match Factory last year. The factory began production in March of this year. The factory originally had a capital of 60,000 yuan, but only 10,000 yuan was raised. The shareholders were Wang Zihe and others, and the manager was Chuan Kanghui. After boycotting Japanese goods, due to the lack of raw materials and the accumulation of inventory, the factory had been closed for three months. Unexpectedly, yesterday (22) at 2:00 p.m., a fire suddenly broke out. All the machines and workshops for making matches, a total of 16 rooms, and more than 400 boxes of matches were burned to ashes. The loss was estimated to be more than 20,000 yuan. The electric motors of the electric light factory were also damaged, and the value was also high. The cause of the fire was said to be due to excessive pressure from the piled-up goods.</p>
<p>Lake bandits loot and kidnap people on Jiaoshan. Recently, a large group of lake bandits in Taihu Lake, on two large fishing boats, anchored near Jiaoshan, and have been looting small fishing boats for several days. They have also kidnapped Xu Rongda and are heading towards Sanshan.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Statistics on Japanese goods sealed up in the provincial capital. The Jiangsu Provincial People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association previously worked with representatives of the Zhenjiang Industry Association to seal up Japanese goods in various businesses. The Association has now sent personnel to conduct a detailed investigation to understand the amount and value of the sealed goods. The investigation has been completed and the statistics show that there are 5,350 items, with a total value of 471,741 yuan. A written report has been submitted to the Provincial Party Headquarters for verification.</p>
<p>No one is in charge of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education. Cheng Tianfang, the newly appointed Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, is currently serving concurrently as the secretary of the First Middle School, making it difficult for him to come to Zhenjiang at this time. When Cheng was appointed to the Jiangsu Department of Education, he had resolved to resign, but he has not yet taken office. As a result, the Jiangsu Department of Education is in a state of no one in charge. The staff are idle all day, and there are many important documents piled up. The staff in the Department are eager for Cheng to come to the province and make some arrangements to avoid this prolonged stagnation.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from the Tenth District Office of Nanhui County</h3>
<p>To the Editor: On the 20th of this month, your newspaper's Nanhui correspondence column reported that Du Ying, the head of the tenth district of this county, had resigned due to disputes arising from the proposed merger of Taiping and other townships with Fengdu, and that the district office had been destroyed. The county government approved his resignation and temporarily appointed Zhang Jinou, the head of the fifth district, to act as his replacement. This is not consistent with the facts. District Head Du was recently granted leave by the county government due to a major event that prevented him from being present at the office. He did not resign. We hope you will publish this letter in the correspondence column to clarify the truth. Seal of the Tenth District Office of Nanhui County, December 21st.</p>
<h3>Letter from Hu Tongseng and Yang Yuru of Wuxi</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I have just read your newspaper's foreign news from Wuxi, which stated that Tongseng and others led seven or eight people to question the county party headquarters, resulting in damage to property. This is not consistent with the facts. When Tongseng and others clashed with the county headquarters, they were attending a party affairs improvement meeting at the First District Party Headquarters. There was no possibility of leading people to question. I am concerned that the outside world may not know the truth and have doubts. I am writing this letter to clarify the matter and hope that it will be published in the correspondence column. I would be very grateful. Hu Tongseng, Yang Yuru, December 23rd.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<p>Resistance Against Japan and Military Training (Wang Geng)</p>
<p>The solution after resistance against Japan is a military solution. The purpose of military training is to ensure that all people have military knowledge and skills. The ultimate goal is to consolidate national defense. Now the Training Supervision Department has issued a notice to all secondary schools and above in the country to intensify military training. This is indeed a fundamental way for young people to save the country. However, attention should be paid to the basic understanding of those receiving training. The author has been involved in this field for several years and knows a thing or two about its shortcomings. Now, in the midst of the nationwide call for resistance against Japan and the intensified military training of young people, I would like to offer my humble opinion to the national education community and young people.</p>
<p>First, Have an Ideology. The success of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution was due to the Three Principles of the People. No matter how big or small a thing is, it will never be successful without an ideology. Military training without an ideology will certainly create a useless army. In the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese had the ideology of avenging their shame, so they were able to defeat Russia in one battle. In the French Revolution, the soldiers all embraced the ideology of freedom and equality, and despite decades of bloody battles, they still achieved final success. Similarly, American soldiers have the Monroe Doctrine, Japanese troops have the Greater East Asia Doctrine, and German troops have the overseas colonial doctrine. Whether their ideologies are right or wrong is another question. We should know that an ideology is a must. Our military training should be based on the ideology of saving the country, or rather, the ideology of resistance.</p>
<p>Second, Have a Common Enemy. An army must have a common enemy. With a common enemy, the soldiers will be brave and invincible. For example, in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the French common enemy was Germany. After the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's common enemy was Russia. After the European War, America's common enemy was Japan. They always envision how the common enemy will be in their daily military training in order to prepare for war. Our military training should also have a common enemy. Who is the common enemy? It is Japan and the great powers.</p>
<p>Third, Be Strict and Obedient. The strength of an army has two types: one is tangible strength, such as the number of soldiers and horses, and the sharpness of weapons; the other is intangible strength, such as strict discipline, obedience, and bravery. Intangible strength is very important in determining the size of combat power. There are many historical examples of an army with this intangible strength being able to defeat the enemy. In the Wuchang Uprising, the leader was a platoon leader named Xiong Bingkun with only thirty-one bullets, yet he captured the city of Wuchang. Just imagine, thirty-two bullets, even if one bullet kills one person, would only kill thirty-two people. This was entirely due to the intangible strength. Therefore, military training should absolutely eliminate all romantic and casual habits.</p>
<p>Fourth, Be Able to Endure Hardship. Since the purpose of military training is to consolidate national defense, the future war will be with foreigners, not with our own Chinese people. There will be no convenience in fighting foreigners like in a civil war. A military expert once told me that in the future, fighting foreigners will probably not be like running forward in a civil war, but crawling forward. Because of the power of telegraphs and artillery fire, it will be impossible to stand upright and move forward. Airplanes will drop bombs from the air, so defense will require living in trenches. How can a person without the ability to endure hardship survive in this situation? Therefore, when we receive military training, we should resolve to embrace the spirit of enduring hardship.</p>
<p>The above four points are all fundamental requirements for an army. Young people, do you believe me? Please wake up quickly and put them into practice for the sake of the country! (Written at Wuxi Education College)</p>
<h3>After Visiting the Patriotic Activities Achievement Competition Fair - Zhang Angqian</h3>
<p>There have been many competitions, but the Patriotic Activities Achievement Competition Fair held by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau is probably its pioneering work. It is based on the observation that the so-called patriotism and education to save the country are not necessarily mutually supportive. Talking about education, it seems that the meaning of patriotism is completely contained within. Talking about patriotism, education is often seen as a slow and ineffective plan. The mistakes of the past are so great that we must have today's awareness to learn from the past. Where does the awareness come from? In China, where the enemy is deep and the disaster is urgent, although education has no national boundaries, if we want to resist insults and save the country, we must follow the Prime Minister's nationalism and take patriotism as the center of implementing the Three Principles of the People. To observe the past achievements of various schools in patriotic education and to indicate and inspire the future direction of efforts of various schools, the Patriotic Activities Achievement Competition Fair is still admired. Therefore, it is known that this fair is not only a need to adapt to the current environment, but also cannot be compared with ordinary competitions. The mission and significance of the fair are uniquely great and tragic. After the visit, I have some feelings, and I write them down as follows: (A) In terms of planning, the implementation plan of patriotic activities in Danhua, the implementation outline of patriotic activity center education in He'an, and the current affairs education in the national crisis in Luhu, (divided into) (1) Today's classroom, (2) Newspaper education, (3) National crisis current affairs, (4) Clear goals, (5) Teaching time, (6) Selection of pen and paper, (7) Scope of materials, (8) Newspaper reading guidance, (9) Opportunity giving, (10) Instance contribution, (11) Teacher reference, (12) (Conclusion,) are relatively thorough and appropriate.</p>
<p>(B) In terms of teaching, the teaching outline of the Northeast Incident in Qimei and the research outline of patriotic activity center education in He'an are both suitable for the main points.</p>
<p>(C) In terms of teaching materials, such as the teaching materials for the low-grade group of Jiancheng School, (Little friends, you must know that a piece of candy, a bag of fruit, bought to eat, not full, save some money, build guns and cannons, Japanese slaves overthrow the country) and the self-compiled teaching materials of Shanghai Private Elementary School (A short man in a Taoist robe, a short woman in a nun's robe, a short child, neither monk nor Taoist) (2) (The beautiful cherry blossom is the national flower of the Japanese, but the cherry blossom is not as good as the plum blossom, Great China, not afraid of the small three islands,) are worthy of being clear and appropriate. The supplementary teaching materials for each subject in Dui De School are also very commendable.</p>
<p>(D) In terms of student achievements, the competition results of each subject in Xicheng, the test results of Wan Zhu's Yu Chan, the comparison of important commercial ports and ports in Northeast China and the armament of China, Japan, and the world, the results of children's spontaneous activity in He'an, various current affairs tests, the publication of children's weekly newspapers, the survey form of domestic and Japanese goods, and the results of each subject in Zhenxiu show that there are a large number of student products.</p>
<p>(E) In terms of forms, the list of major chemical weapons appearing in World War I in Wu Ben Girls' Middle School, the list of Japanese newspapers and Shenxun News Agency in China in Wusong Middle School, the table of Japanese cultural aggression in the three northeastern provinces, the table of Japanese forced opening of Chinese commercial ports, the list of aquatic products in the three northeastern provinces in Xicheng, the table of Japanese aggression and atrocities against our country in Yinxi, the list of ten boycotts of Japanese goods movement in Yinxi (divided into period, reason, and efficiency), the comparison of Chinese and Japanese goods in Guangyu Elementary School, the comparison table of Chinese and Japanese agricultural products, and the statistics table of paper, cotton fabrics, and sugar imports of Japanese goods in the southern district in recent three years are accurate and appropriate in content. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Middle School Students Discuss Resuming Classes Without Results</h3>
<p>A Dispute Arises Between Mingqiang and Anmo's</p>
<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation held its 11th plenary representative meeting at Qingxin Middle School on Lujiabang Road, Ximen, at 10 a.m. yesterday. Representatives from 47 schools, totaling over a hundred people, attended. The chairman, Li Bin of Huijian Middle School, immediately began to</p>
<p>discuss the issue of resuming classes. Some representatives advocated reconsideration, while others unanimously insisted on waiting for the demonstration group to return to Shanghai from Beijing before resuming classes. There was a fierce debate between those who supported and those who opposed resuming classes, and the atmosphere was very tense. The discussion continued from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. without any results. While the meeting was in progress, Sun Zihe, a representative of Mingqiang Middle School students at Anmo's Girls' Middle School, reported that the school authorities had issued a notice to all students yesterday, ordering them to attend classes immediately, otherwise the supply of electricity, water, and food would be stopped, and they also demanded that the anti-Japanese associations of both schools be disbanded at the same time, otherwise they would be expelled from the school. Yesterday, the Student Federation sent Fang Zhou and Li Bin to investigate. As a result, the students resolved to petition to attend classes in order to avoid disputes and requested that the authorities not interfere with the anti-Japanese work. However, their request was not granted, and the students were extremely angry and reconsidered continuing the strike. According to Li Bin, the chairman of the Secondary School Student Federation, both schools were founded by the American Christian Baptist Church, and although they are called two schools, they have the same principal, Li Haoshan. This morning, he ordered all students to leave the school and cut off all supplies. The conference resolved to send a hundred volunteers to maintain order.</p>
<p>Fang Xuanzhou, a representative of Dongwu No. 2 Middle School, reported that the school authorities had ordered the students to resume classes immediately and requested that the students respond before 2 p.m. today (i.e., yesterday). He asked the conference to consider this and stated that if the association had no ability to provide assistance, the school would have no choice but to withdraw from the Student Federation and compromise. The conference representatives immediately went to various schools to investigate and negotiate.</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, when the Secondary School Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation held a representative conference at Qingxin Middle School yesterday morning, representatives from Mingqiang and Anmo's schools reported that the two schools were forcing students to leave the school and had decided to stop supplying water, electricity, and food this afternoon (i.e., yesterday), otherwise the students would have to resume classes unconditionally. The school also reported to the Public Security Bureau, asking them to dispatch officers to the school to suppress the students for not maintaining order. The Public Security Bureau has dispatched over twenty police officers to the school to monitor the situation. Please send personnel to assist. Upon receiving the report, the Student Federation immediately dispatched volunteers from Qingxin, Quanzhang, and Gongshi schools to the rescue. Because the volunteers from Quanzhang all had fake firearms, they were unable to pass through the concession. Therefore, they sent a small number of personnel, unarmed, to Mingqiang and Anmo's schools to maintain order and rescue the forced students. At around 3 p.m., the representatives of various schools who were attending the conference in Qingxin went to Mingqiang and Anmo's schools. For a time, the disciplinary team, volunteers, and representatives such as Yu Xi were all over the two schools, and they monitored the telephones to prevent external actions. After the representatives of each school arrived, they held a representative conference in the auditorium of Mingqiang to continue discussing countermeasures. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The school shall not interfere with students' patriotic movement. (2) The school authorities shall not prevent students from complying with all resolutions of the Student Federation. (3) The Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association shall not be dissolved under any pretext. (4) Anti-Japanese association officers shall not be dismissed under any pretext. (5) A memorial week for the Premier must be held with fifteen articles that must be required for Ming An two schools to effectively recognize, the conference elected representatives Jiao Cai Xian and others to negotiate with the president, but because the president was not present, only to be flat-handed to the director of the Department of Li Xingxian to answer on behalf of said that I was in charge of teaching affairs, can only implement all matters related to teaching affairs, for the school's major events, can not be responsible on behalf of the reply. The representatives withdrew,</p>
<p>Da Da Zhong both got nowhere, and then held a meeting to decide to must be from Ming An the school principal Li Haoshan (both schools are Mr. Li as the president) to give a personal answer before 5 pm today, after the meeting adjourned, and set for today at 10 am, again at the Qingxin Middle School to hold a representative conference to continue to discuss the countermeasures of Ming An two schools matters last night, Mingqiang Middle School and prepared dinner to pay tribute to the representatives of the schools, by the landlords, after the meal hired a car to return, has been in the evening at 9 o'clock already,</p>

The students of our school, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, are making a tragic performance in sorrow and indignation, hoping to awaken compatriots to resist Japan together. Therefore, there is today's performance. This is a sad move, definitely not entertainment.

<p>Since the Japanese occupied the Eastern Province, all the teachers and students of the Ximen Chinese Medicine College in the city have been extremely angry. Therefore, they organized a youth volunteer army team last month and engaged in training in the public sports ground every day. Their spirit is full and their steps are neat. A swearing-in ceremony was held in the auditorium of the school at 4 pm yesterday. Each member deeply understood the current situation of the country and was willing to sacrifice for the country. The director and teachers of the school, Chen Tuzhang, and others, all gave encouraging speeches. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely solemn and tense. From then on, the youth volunteer army has another strong force.</p>

<h3>Changes in the Championship</h3>
<p>The Most Promising Macklin</p>
<p>Suffered a Crushing Defeat Last Night to Rowing Club</p>
<p>Liangjiang Still Has Hope for the Championship</p>
<p>In yesterday's Asian Youth Women's Basketball Game, Liangjiang decisively defeated the Asian Youth Blue Team with a score of 46 to 7. The Blue Team was no match for their opponents. The first half ended with Liangjiang leading 21 to 5. The Blue Team only scored 2 points in the second half. Xi Jun and Shao Jinying played exceptionally well, scoring 23 and 15 points respectively. In the junior division match, the junior team showed dominance throughout, with the Red Team only surpassing them in the final three points to secure victory. In the last match, the Macklin Officers' Wives Team, the most promising contender for the championship, suffered a crushing defeat of 26 to 17 at the hands of the Rowing Club. Macklin was subdued throughout, while Rowing Club played smoothly, with their forwards and guards being exceptionally sharp.</p>
<p>Liangjiang   Fouls   Score  Blue Team  Fouls Score</p>
<p>Shao Jinying (Forward) Once Fifteen Lancebin (Forward) 0 times 3 points</p>
<p>Xi Jun (Forward) 0 times Twenty-three Nikalao (Forward) Once 0 points</p>

<p>(1) Youth A Wins over Youth B Second Half Fourteen points to Three points</p>
<p>Total Twenty-four points to Seven points</p>
<p>First Half Ten points to Fourteen</p>
<p>(2) Red Team Wins over Junior Team Second Half Twenty points to Ten points</p>

<p>First Half Fifteen points to Nine points</p>
<p>(3) Rowing Club Wins over Macklin Second Half Twelve points to Seven points</p>
<p>Total Twenty-seven points to Sixteen</p>
<h3>The Situation Changes</h3>
<p>After Macklin's victory over Liangjiang, they seemed poised to retain the championship. However, last night's defeat casts doubt on their prospects. Although Rowing Club had previously lost to the Red Team, their performance last night showed true championship mettle. Although the Red Team has not yet lost, it is feared that they will be unable to defeat Macklin and Liangjiang. The outcome of Liangjiang's match against Rowing Club is also difficult to predict. Therefore, after this battle, the future championship is uncertain. Rowing Club may also stand a chance.</p>

<h3>China Youth Association Football Competition</h3>
<p>Twenty-nine Teams Joining Today's Representatives Meeting</p>
<p>The football competition organized by the China Youth Association closed its registration the day before yesterday. It is reported that there has been an enthusiastic response, with a total of twenty-nine teams joining. Most of these teams are newly established, and the team members are mostly comrades from the business community who have a strong interest in football. Once they engage in mutual learning and improvement, their football skills will undoubtedly surpass what they were in the past. Therefore, the association has high hopes for each team, hoping that they will not aim solely to win the championship but will prioritize practicing their football skills. It is reported that the association is scheduled to convene representatives from each team at the sports department at 5:00 PM today to discuss competition rules, fill out team member lists, submit photos of the entire team, and pay membership fees and deposits.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts of Dai Liang</h3>
<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>Su Shi of the Song Dynasty had a passion for inkstones. He possessed many fine pieces. By today's era, almost none remain. Currently, those who are renowned for collecting inkstones are Xu Xiuzhi and Lin Baishui. However, Lin's collection is far less extensive and exquisite than Xu's. Xu is known throughout the country as the owner of the Hundred Inkstone Studio. It is said that he has acquired renowned inkstones such as the Banana Leaf White Jade with Yellow Duan Blood Silk Orchid Pavilion Residual Stone Inkstone at great expense. His deep passion for inkstones is evident. However, after Lin Baishui passed away, most of his inkstone collection was acquired by the Japanese. Only two large Qinghua ice-pattern inkstones remain in China. Xu feared that these would also be purchased by the Japanese, so he repeatedly asked people to plead with Lin's descendants to sell them to him. He has already acquired the Qinghua ice-pattern inkstones. He held a banquet in the Hundred Inkstone Studio, inviting Wang Fuan, Qin Gangsun, He Tianjian, and others to evaluate them. They all praised them highly. The so-called ice patterns resemble drooping willow branches, with a beautiful color. They are rare and precious inkstones that are unmatched in modern times. After discussions, it was decided that Xu would purchase them to prevent them from flowing into the three islands of Japan. Each person composed a poem on the spot to commemorate the occasion. By the time the banquet ended, it was already past midnight.</p>

<h3>How Can One Avoid Being a Relic of the Past?</h3>
<p>Reply to a Letter from a Young Elementary School Teacher</p>
<p>...Reading your letter, I am so gratified to know that you aspire to make progress! If we don't want to be relics of the past, we must specialize in a natural science. Natural science is the express train to the ideal world. Stay on board and you will never be left behind. I now plan to devote the rest of my life to specializing in a science. Let's ride this train together! From agricultural civilization to industrial civilization, natural science is the only bridge. Elementary school teachers must hold the torch of science to guide children through the transition. Those who do not understand science will soon be unable to teach. But there is one thing you must keep in mind: science has been used by butchers as a weapon to kill. We must seize science from the hands of the butchers. We must teach students to use science to help people cross, not to use science to prevent people from crossing. We must use science to suppress the strong and support the weak. The mission of science is to create a wealthy society, not wealthy individuals. Before natural science becomes a national product, we must master a foreign language to acquire the latest knowledge and methods in natural science. These are all things you need to recognize and prepare for. Come and let's talk in detail!...</p>
<h3>Going to War</h3>
<p>— A Member of the First Youth Support-Horse Team</p>
<p>(7) Leaving Wuxi</p>
<p>The lemon-colored sun hangs obliquely on the distant treetops. It was probably a little past five o'clock at this time. The train car was still rushing forward like lightning. Suddenly, we heard a burst of bomb-like sounds coming from the west. We were invigorated by this sound, but only our hearts were shaken. Our eyes did not shift to the outside of the train window. We remained calmly seated in the car, because the most important thing for soldiers is (to observe order) and discipline. Soon, the train approached the platform. We saw compatriots welcoming us, clapping enthusiastically and shouting. Only then did I understand the sound just now came from their palms.</p>
<p>We got off the platform. After slightly tidying up everything, we exited the station in single file, led by the security team's music band, all the way to the Wujin County Party Department, where we stayed. That night, we were treated to a grand banquet by the county government.</p>
<p>Changzhou combs are renowned in Jiangsu. I still remember the spring of the eighteenth year, when my father, mother, sisters, brothers, and I were touring here. I bought two combs to take home. Now my mother and sister are still using them. Now that I have returned to the old place, seeing things reminds me of people. I can't help but think of the people at home. But I can only look at the sky and pray silently for my family's happiness. I also thought, this situation is like the Tang poem (Raising my head, I gaze at the bright moon; Lowering my head, I think of my hometown). So I took this matter—thinking of home—as poetic, as an ideal poetic sentiment. Now we should immediately abandon our pens and join the army. How can we carefully savor the sacredness of this all-encompassing poetry?</p>
<p>This morning (the 15th), all sectors of Changzhou held a welcome and send-off rally like Wuxi. About five or six thousand people attended. After the meeting, the attendees sent us to the station. In an instant, the platform was unbearably crowded. Those who came later had no place to stand. After three o'clock, the whistle sounded. The train moved slowly. The send-offs waved their hands frequently in farewell. Most of the female students from Changzhou Girls' Middle School were in tears, knowing that their hearts had long been wearied for the country.</p>
<h3>On Dong Xiujia</h3>
<p>— Zhi Jun</p>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, Dong Xiujia, is a senior of the students studying in the United States. His morality and writing are quite commendable. What is most commendable is that he has no hobbies in his life. Although he smokes cigarettes, he only smokes two or three a day. He never touches wine or women, and gambling is out of the question. The former Director of the Jiangsu People's Department, Hu Pu'an, worked with Dong for five or six years in the Road Administration. He once said that Mr. Dong never wasted a minute of his life. His character can be seen from this. In recent years, the film craze has risen, and almost everyone watches movies. However, Dong has lived in Shanghai for many years and still does not know where the New Guang and Guanglu theaters are. Once, there was an appointment to meet at the Odeon Theater, but he did not arrive until after 4 o'clock. People were surprised that Dong, who never broke his promises, had broken his word. After waiting another fifteen minutes, he finally arrived, covered in sweat. It turned out that he had been searching for an hour. This is also a well-known anecdote.</p>
<h3>New Christmas Sounds</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Time flies. The annual Christmas is here again. Westerners celebrate Christmas with friends and relatives, making it extremely lively. However, with the advancement of science today, social customs are also changing daily. And this year's Christmas has even greater changes.</p>
<p>Anti-Christmas Movement in Moscow Since the revolution, Russia has strongly opposed religion. All religious courses in schools are banned. This policy has not changed to this day. Every Christmas, there is also an anti-religious movement. This year, it was held in early December, two weeks before Christmas. Stores are not allowed to sell various gifts and children's toys, and all Christmas trees are cut down as much as possible in advance. At the same time, farmers are prohibited from selling Christmas trees. The intensity of Soviet Russia's opposition to religion can be seen in general.</p>
<p>The Great Revolution of Santa Claus Every Christmas, Western countries have the custom of giving gifts, buying candies and toys for children. However, this year, this custom has changed. Westerners believe that this method of expressing goodwill and giving gifts is too old-fashioned and should be reformed. Therefore, they all use the method of directly sending congratulations through the telephone. In addition, they use telephoto transmission to send handwritten greetings or portraits of themselves to relatives and friends. Moreover, British people who want to send their photos to relatives and friends living in Austria, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, etc., can arrive within twenty minutes. This is extremely fast and convenient.</p>
<p>Airplanes Distribute Christmas Cards The British Post Office has long known in advance that there will be a large number of telephone photographs and congratulatory telegrams before Christmas, and the transportation sector will be extremely busy. Therefore, it has decided to use airplanes to deliver Christmas cards in order to be fast. It also plans to use wireless broadcasting, so that everyone can send congratulations by telegram. Australian airlines are also preparing to collect Christmas cards and New Year cards from the 18th and deliver them by plane to avoid missing the deadline.</p>
<h3>Chicken Talks</h3>
<p>— Master of Paper Account Copper Bottle Studio</p>
<p>Chicken is the only tonic product in winter. Its effectiveness is higher than that of all mutton paste, beef floss, milk, soy milk, and so on. In the past, Li Hefei ate a young chicken every day in the winter months. He was energetic and suffered no diseases or pain throughout the year. Also, the wise son of my teacher, Hu Buyi, had carbuncles on his back that were cut out with a knife. He stopped eating meat. However, the wound sank down an inch and never healed for a long time. He then killed chickens to eat with his meals, and did so every day. In less than half a month, the defect was completely filled. This is another clear proof. During the time of the late Qing Dynasty, Gao, a Taoist priest from the Baiyun Temple outside Xibianmen in the capital, was good at making diced chicken. Wanfuju on Yangmeizhu inclined street inherited his method and became famous within the forbidden palace. It was called Gao's Diced Chicken. My friend Huang Yiru stayed in the capital for a long time and once tasted it. He praised it endlessly. It is indeed a good taste.</p>
<p>In the past, when Tang Bin of Suiyang was an official in Wuzhong, his wife and sons wore simple clothes and ate simple food. In spring, they picked wild shepherd's purse every day and made it into soup with soybeans. Therefore, there was a saying among the people that it was like bean curd soup. One day, someone bought a chicken on the market. The public was shocked and said, "I have never eaten chicken since I came to Wu. Who bought it?" The servant kowtowed and said, "The son." The public was angry and immediately summoned the son to kneel in the courtyard and scolded him, "Do you think Suzhou chickens are cheaper than those in Henan? If you want to eat chicken, then go home. How can a scholar do anything without chewing on vegetable roots?" He also dismissed the servant and sent him away. This became a laughing stock for a time.</p>
<p>The ancient essayist Fang Wangxi was only four years old when his father taught him the classics every day. He once got up early, ordered the rooster to crow and challenge him to write a couplet. He immediately responded: "The dragon's breath forms clouds." Such was his intelligence.</p>
<p>Taihe County in Jiangxi produces brocade chickens. Their five colors are gorgeous. Former President Taft loved to raise them and fed them grains every day.</p>
<p>The DeMar factory uses a cold-pressing method to make chicken juice. It is sold all over Europe. As a result, it slaughters as many as 300 million chickens every year. The identification of chickens is extremely precise. The size of the chicken farms is even larger than the ancient chicken workshops.</p>
<p>Taiwan was originally called Chicken Cage Mountain because of its shape. Now that Taiwan has been incorporated into the Japanese territory, looking east with our heads raised, we cannot help but feel sad.</p>
<p>Hearing the rooster crow and dancing, this is Zu Ti's heroic spirit. When foreign insults are imminent and national disasters are at hand, our people should take Zu Ti as an example and the rooster's crow as an alarm clock. This is acceptable.</p>
<h3>Mr. Gao Junshan Returns from Europe and America to Talk about National Disaster (7)</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>China is Japan's large marketplace. Therefore, if the boycott of Japanese goods can be maintained permanently, it can cause great economic losses to Japan. However, there is a danger of shaking the boycott movement. Many merchants want to sell off their inventory immediately because they have too much stock and are short of funds. There are even a few unscrupulous merchants who want to sell the registered Japanese goods unconditionally, so that they can simultaneously sell off the Japanese goods that they have privately imported later. Recently, people in society have discussed the methods for disposing of sealed Japanese goods. Among them, the most reasonable method is to put the Japanese goods aside for several months and then concentrate them for public sale. In this way, if the Sino-Japanese problem is completely resolved in the future, Japanese goods can still be imported again after economic resumption. At least Japan will have suffered losses within this period.</p>
<p>I believe that the Sino-Japanese problem will not have a satisfactory result. What is being contested now is only the amount of damage. As for the boycott of Japanese goods, it must be maintained permanently. From now on, our people vow to never use Japanese goods again, in order to give Japan a small economic wound. As for the Japanese goods that are currently sealed, if it is necessary to sell them urgently in order to save the money supply in the market, then a suitable location must be designated for centralized public sale in order to prevent malpractice. Now, some people are strongly opposed to centralized public sale and are making every effort to advocate free sale. All discerning people can see that this proposal is not supported by merchants who sincerely boycott Japanese goods. Only a few people have other intentions, so they made this proposal. We must all pay attention to this point at all times, so that the boycott movement, which has been so hard-won, does not fall short. This boycott relies entirely on the automatic awareness of merchants, so the results are better than the previous few times. I hope that patriotic merchants will continue to do so from beginning to end and not be manipulated by a few people. As for the general public, who have no weapons, they cannot all go to the battlefield to kill the enemy. If they want to save the country, permanently boycotting Japanese goods is a very important task. (End)</p>
<h3>Record of Item Wang Jiali's Thrift</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>The Xiang Wang here does not refer to Xiang Yu, who defeated Qin, but to Xiang Zelin, the second son of Mr. Xiang Songmao, and Ms. Wang Zhenhua. Zelin is talented, and Zhenhua is artistic. They are a perfect match. It is appropriate that both families of Xiang Wang are happy. Moreover, Mr. Huang Renzhi was the officiant, Mr. Zhang Zhijiang gave a speech, and thousands of guests came to the ceremony. Celebrities in Shanghai also attended the ceremony in person, making it a grand occasion for a while.</p>
<p>The joy of the newlyweds is immeasurable, and the merits of the hosts are immeasurable. They moved the entire amount of the banquet funds to help the winter relief effort, benefiting the disaster victims. Their good intentions are commendable. Previously, the hosts stated in their invitation: (The country is in danger, and times are difficult. We are marrying our son to fulfill our wishes. Everything is kept simple and economical. There will be no banquet to trouble our friends to attend. We have already received much honor and favor. All customary gifts are kindly declined.) Therefore, there was no music in the hall that day, and there were no screens on the four walls. It is said that this civilianized wedding is a good example to follow today.</p>
<p>Brief News The second part of Tianyi Company's sound film (Last Love) has been screened at the New Light Theater and has been sold out for days. It will continue to be screened from today. The third part of its sound film (Shanghai Miss) has now been filmed and will also be screened soon.</p>

<h3>Sharing the Same Hatred (3)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Bloodshed on the Battlefield</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Ren Yuan of the artillery also said, "The Sunlight Army has reinforcements everywhere, while our army is isolated and without support. Military supplies and food are in great shortage. When we sent troops last time, we relied on the support of the Sunlight Country. Now, after two fierce battles, more than half of our supplies have been consumed. If we were to confront them head-on, I'm afraid we would be outnumbered and difficult to win. It's better to choose a strategic mountain and retreat temporarily. In the future, we can contact the troops from H province and then make plans." Hua Naiqiang nodded and said, "Very good. But I don't know the geography. Is there any strategic mountain valley nearby where we can temporarily stop?" Ren Yuan said, "Yes, yes. About sixty or seventy miles from Yejigang, there is Centipede Ridge. It is extremely secluded and dangerous. Because the entrance to the mountain is only a narrow path, and both sides are steep cliffs that are impossible to climb. It is shaped like a centipede, hence the name Centipede Ridge. It truly fits the ancient saying, 'One man guards the pass, and ten thousand men cannot pass.' If we hold on to it, even if the enemy is numerous, it will be difficult for them to penetrate. Overlooking from the ridge, everything nearby is very clear. As long as we set up cannons and bombard the enemy, it will be difficult for the enemy to cross the line of fire. Moreover, there are fields in the mountains that can be cultivated, and there are also good people living there. We don't have to worry about the lack of food." Hua Naiqiang said, "Since there is such a place, I will order the team to leave tomorrow morning." Zhong Shu said, "The most hateful thing is that the Sunlight Army relies on the power of their planes to constantly attack us. We don't have anti-aircraft guns, so we are greatly affected." Ren Yuan said, "We have flat-trajectory guns. If we turn the muzzles upward, we can also bombard low-flying planes." Hua Naiqiang said, "Then, if enemy planes come in the future, please ask Battalion Commander Ren to try it." Ren Yuan nodded and said, "Yes, yes." So everyone stayed in the camp for one night. The next morning, Hua Naiqiang got up, and Zhong Shu also came over. The two of them walked out of the camp tent and stood on the hill to breathe in the fresh air. Hua Naiqiang was about to order his subordinates to leave when he saw two black spots far away in the clouds. Before long, he heard the creaking sound of two red Sunlight Army planes heading this way. They got closer and bigger, circling in the air and gradually lowering. At this time, everyone was on alert. Hua Naiqiang and Zhong Shu stood still, unmoved. One of the planes suddenly dropped down and threw out a bomb, which landed right on the hill. Several warhorses were blown away. Hua Naiqiang remained calm, ordering his subordinates to raise their guns and wait. Then, with a bang, a cannonball flew out of the forest on the hill, hitting one of the Sunlight Army planes and falling into the deep ravine below. The other plane was so frightened that it did not dare to stay and flew back quickly. Everyone cheered. It turned out that Ren Yuan had seen the plane coming and had set up the flat-trajectory gun in the forest, with the muzzle facing upwards, waiting quietly for the plane to descend and drop its bomb. Then, he accurately fired a shot, which hit its mark. Hua Naiqiang and Zhong Shu were overjoyed and ordered their subordinates to prepare to go to Centipede Ridge, led by Ren Yuan. When they arrived in the mountains, they set up camp and cooked rice. Naiqiang, Zhong Shu, and Ren Yuan went to the entrance of the mountain to inspect the terrain. It was indeed steep and winding. Hua Naiqiang then ordered Ren Yuan to lead the artillery battalion to be stationed on the mountain, and ordered two infantry battalions to guard the entrance, forming a joint defense.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Drops Ten Taels</h3>
<p>Reaction after Two Consecutive Days of Gains. Yesterday's gold price reflected the reaction after two consecutive days of gains. It even broke below 680 taels, creating a complex situation where operators felt hesitant. There were fluctuations, with a difference of 16 taels between the morning and evening prices. Ultimately, it fell back ten taels. The initial drop was due to a slight decrease in the large bars. However, initially, the exchange rate was stable and firm, even briefly rising to 690 taels. Later, various firms supplied more than demand, especially as the foreign exchange market went from tight to abundant. Although the listed rates narrowed, the hidden trend was different, leading to a sharp decline of more than ten taels. It dropped from above 90 taels to within 75 taels. The future market was quiet due to Wednesday being a non-trading day for foreign exchange, so there wasn't much trading activity. The price fluctuated by only four or five taels. The short positions that hadn't been fully covered were heavily suppressed, leading the longs to recklessly inflate the price, almost reaching 30 taels, but the situation was complex and uncertain. Rumors circulated about peaceful negotiations between the longs and shorts, with the shorts requesting a reduction in the premium, but the longs had no concrete plan. These were just rumors. Currently, Yu Feng, Yong Heng Xing, and the arbitrageurs are mainly long, while retail investors and Wu Mou, Cheng Feng Yong Yuan, and Zang Yong are short.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Relaxes and Plunges. The exchange rate dropped two taels from the opening, to 686 taels and 5 qian. The large silver bars only fell by 1/16, the forward rate by 1/8, and the private telegram rate by 1/4. However, due to a large deficit, the decrease seemed small. Next was 86 taels, but Yuan Mao, Yong Yi, Feng Yong, Yu Da, Ri Chang, Yuan Tai, and others were buying, and banks were trading 3-month US dollars at $33.125. Macgarry offered British pounds at half a penny, causing a sudden rise of more than four taels, reaching 90 taels and 5 qian. Suddenly, a decline was seen, with Heng Yu, Tian Feng, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong Yu, Da Cui Chang, Yong Da De Cheng, and Wu Mou selling in succession. Additionally, US dollars could be settled at 25, and then Banque Belge offered 375, causing the market to weaken and sharply drop to 89 taels. When the British pound was announced, it was 81 taels, but the listed rate was small, at 25, and the US dollar at 125. Gan Chang Xiang, Yuan Mao Yong Shun Li, and others came in, immediately raising the price to 84 taels and 8 qian. HSBC absorbed 3-month contracts at 5625. Later, Yi Feng, Heng Xing, Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Ri Chang Hong, Kang Yong Zhi Feng, Yong Feng, etc., became excited. HSBC then offered April contracts at half a yuan, Zhejiang offered 625, and the gold price plunged more than seven taels, reaching 77 taels and 5 qian after 10:30. There was a brief rebound of two or three taels, and then Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Mao Yong, and arbitrageurs bought, raising the price by more than six taels after ten minutes, reaching 84 taels at 10:55. Afterwards, the trend weakened. Banks traded near-term British pounds at 75, Zhejiang offered 3-month contracts at 625, and US dollars at $33.625, with both buying and selling possible. On the floor, Heng Xing, Bing Xing, Dalian gangs, Fu Yu, and others were selling aggressively. The gold price fluctuated around 80 taels. After 11:30, the price felt particularly weak, suddenly dropping to 74 taels and 5 qian at noon, and closing at 5 taels and 8 qian, then reaching 56 taels. The indicative price was changed to 730 taels, a difference of 47 or 48 taels to 45 or 46 taels, and then to 54 or 55 taels.</p>
<p>The Aftermarket Enters a Sluggish State. The aftermarket opened at 77 taels and 5 qian, due to a small report from Bombay at 6 annas. Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan Da, Yong Tong Tai Chang, and others bought, pushing the price up by more than two taels, to 79 taels. At 2:30, Heng Yu, Gan Chang Xiang, Heng Chang Yong, and others sold, and Bombay reported a large return of 3 or 4 annas, causing a downstream movement. At 3:00, the price was 74 taels and 5 qian. Gan Chang Xiang and Li bought, raising the price by another five taels, reaching 79 taels and 8 qian at 3:30. Afterwards, there seemed to be more sellers, causing a decrease of two or three taels. However, from 3:30 to 4:00, there was a slight fluctuation of about two taels, then 77 taels. After 4:15, Hong Kang Yong Hui Xiang and arbitrageurs pulled in, resulting in 79 taels and a half. At the 4:30 closing, it was 78 taels and a half, a decrease of ten taels compared to the day before yesterday.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Will Bond Interest and Principal Payments Be Delayed?</h3>
<p>People are Very Anxious, and the Market is Falling Sharply.</p>
<p>The Aftermarket Buying Interest Suddenly Surged, and the Market Soared.</p>
<p>Yesterday (December 23), the trading situation on the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was as follows: The spot and futures markets were active. However, the prices of various bonds remained unstable due to market anxiety, and the market fell sharply. It was rumored that a certain party, due to financial difficulties, proposed to the central government to postpone the payment of some bond interest and principal. Upon hearing this, all parties felt extremely apprehensive. If this were confirmed, bond credibility would immediately be lost. Financial institutions holding large amounts of bonds as reserves for issuing currency would have problems with their operations. Bondholders relying on receiving interest and principal would also face immediate pressure. The severity of the situation in the bond market was unprecedented. In this situation, the government should promptly state its position to reassure the public and avoid a mutual downfall and future panic. Furthermore, the Japanese are increasingly plotting against us, increasing troops and preparing for war, and attacking Jinzhou is only a matter of time. However, our government is still undecided and has not made active preparations. All these situations have greatly increased public anxiety. The decline in bond prices is an inevitable trend. Rescue and support are now urgently needed and cannot be delayed any longer. Regarding the changes in various prices yesterday, the first session in the morning saw the sharpest decline, with vigorous selling and scarce demand. Several types of bonds almost reached the continuous decline limit compared to the previous day. The second session gradually stabilized, with some people buying at low prices, slightly raising the prices. However, market news improved in the afternoon, buying interest turned active, and prices mostly rebounded. As a result, the disarmament bonds were suspended for the next month's issue, and the current month's issue also fell sharply. Customs, Reorganization, and 1929 bonds fell by a small yuan, while 1929 Good bonds rebounded by two yuan. 2020 bonds and salt tax bonds also rebounded. The changes were quite drastic. The total spot trading volume was 38,500 yuan. The futures trading volume was 6.06 million in the morning and about 3.6 million in the afternoon, totaling 9.64 million yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Weakness</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak. Due to the barbarity of the Japanese in the Northeast and the increasing fragility of Sino-Japanese relations, public anxiety is rising. Financial conditions are becoming increasingly tight, leading to commercial stagnation. Most people are inclined to sell, making the situation even weaker. However, it is said that the Sichuan merchants' purchasing is still active, while the actions of other merchants are not very clear.</p>
<p>Manchurian Label Drops Sharply. The Manchurian Label market opened with weakness in American cotton. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and the atmosphere was soft. The decline in the current month was severe, reaching 5 qian, and the distant months fell by 2, 3, and 4 qian. In the afternoon, the current month fell by another 7 or 8 qian, and the distant months fell by 1 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 13,700 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Declines</h3>
<p>The cotton market is softening and the situation is flat. The decline in the current month is becoming more severe. Due to the lack of actual demand and factories being full of foreign cotton, they are rejecting domestic cotton, leading to more deliveries. The market atmosphere is particularly weak. However, the distant months have stronger long positions, showing no signs of easing. However, the arrival of Hubei cotton is gradually increasing, making the future of the cotton market uncertain. However, the overall trend is bleak.</p>
<p>Near-Term Hubei Label Falls 2-3 Qian. The Hubei Label market opened with stable American cotton, and there was very little trading in the market. However, the decline in the current month was relatively sharp, falling 2 qian, and the distant months fell by 5 fen.

<p>Yesterday, the vermicelli market largely remained stagnant. As delivery of the current month is approaching, most parties are settling their positions. The long positions are closing out, causing a slight decrease. However, the hedging positions are still active, causing a slight uptick. The future months were initially flat and weak, but due to the near-term conditions, they also slightly stabilized. Considering the upcoming market closure for the year, the fluctuations in the prices of various months should be small. As a result, the current month was down 2.5 li compared to the previous day, January was up 2.5 li, February was unchanged, March was up 1 fen, April was unchanged, and May was down 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Resembles Stoppage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for wheat futures was generally stagnant for all months. The current month has already passed. Due to the very few new transactions in the distant months, both buyers and sellers were mostly at a loss. There were very few transactions throughout the day. In short, the end of the year is approaching and all parties want to wind down operations, whether clients or factories, they do not want to make any changes. A definite plan will only be possible when the market reopens next year. As a result, January was down 1 fen compared to the previous day, February was down 1 fen, March and April were unchanged, and May was up 1 fen.</p>

<h3>Coarse and White Sand Sugar Trend Downward Again</h3>
<p>Taikoo Sugar Market Remains Solid</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market district telegrams: The current price of Cuban sugar remained at 1.09375, and the current prices of New York futures and Javanese sugar remained unchanged. There were very few transactions in the exchange market. The initial market price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white was 9 taels, 6 qian, 7 fen, and a half, with sales relatively strong. The later market price fell to 9 taels, 6 qian, and 2 fen and a half, and milled fine white was 9 taels and 7 qian and a half, with a flat and weak trend. Taikoo sugar sales were also slack, with the market price initially strong and later weak. B Mark was 11 taels, 7 qian, 7 fen, and a half, then 11 taels and 7 qian and a half. CW Mark was 11 taels and 6 qian and a half, HX Mark was 11 taels and 5 qian and a half, and HM was 11 taels and 4 qian to 4 qian and a half. Transactions were also sparse. The market condition still felt solid due to low inventory. If sales improve slightly, there will still be a trend for gradual increases.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods and Longkou Vermicelli Arrive in Large Quantities and Turn Downward</h3>
<p>Because nearly 1,000 Longkou vermicelli have arrived continuously, reaching more than 5,000 packages, the market price has suddenly fallen. The customer price opened at 23 taels, but the market sentiment was that since the inventory was already thick, if sales became stagnant, the price would inevitably loosen again. The market brokers also sold 23 taels yesterday. The various merchants also did not purchase much, as they were observing the abundant source of goods.</p>

<h3>Yuan Straight Tribute Broadcloth Gradually Declines</h3>
<p>Yuan Straight Tribute Broadcloth in wool materials is a popular product in all seasons. All the major and minor wool stores in local and foreign markets have stocked up on them. Recently, the market price of this type of broadcloth has been declining gradually. Except for the famous old brands, other brands have seen an average decrease of three or four qian per yard. This is because the exchange rate has increased, the next batch of arrivals is crowded, and the cost is also lower. Yesterday, Rong Tai 15330 established Lao Tou Hao straight tribute broadcloth was reduced to 8 taels per yard, 31</p>
<h3>Fifty Tons of American Pig Lead Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Metal trading has been extremely quiet lately. As the year draws to a close, various businesses are preparing to settle their accounts. New transactions are minimal, and if there are purchases, they are only for matching colors. Market prices are weak due to a pessimistic outlook and sluggish sales. Although industry peers are trying hard to maintain prices, the poor environment has led to a decline. The abundant arrivals are a major factor in prolonging the slump. For example, the industry has suffered from a large inventory of pig lead. Now, another fifty tons have arrived in Pudong, further depressing the market. The price is estimated at fourteen taels, down two mace and five candareens from before. Actual transactions are only sporadic. The future outlook is not optimistic.</p>

<p>Sales of Gongxi green tea to foreign firms have completely stalled since last month, and the market has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, the Russian Assistance Society reopened trading due to demand from Moscow. Two hundred boxes were sold at a price of forty-two taels, a drop of four to five taels from before. Baochang Foreign Firm has already purchased Wuyuan Zhenmei green tea, and Yongxing is also preparing to buy. The three to four thousand boxes in stock on the market should be sold out without difficulty, but market prices are still likely to fall.</p>

<h3>Maintain the Credit of Public Bonds</h3>
<p>A Matter of Social Security</p>
<p>Unanimous Demand for Protection</p>
<p>A certain Central Committee member proposed to the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee to extend the payment of principal and interest on domestic public bonds. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce issued a declaration the day before yesterday, urging all sectors to pay attention. Yesterday, the local Silver and Money Exchange Association, the Stock Exchange Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee separately, requesting attention to the credit of treasury bills and public bonds to stabilize public sentiment and maintain the financial market. Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce also expressed his views on the matter yesterday. The various news items are summarized below.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams from the Financial Sector: The local Banking Association, the Money Exchange Association, and the Stock Exchange Association believe that public bonds are of great importance. They have separately telegraphed Chairman Lin of the National Government and Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan, requesting attention. The original telegram is as follows: (Submitting a statement on the importance of national debt, requesting attention.) Since the establishment of the National Government four years ago, it has issued more than 900 million yuan of domestic debt. The people have extreme trust in the government and hope that the government will have ample financial resources, political unity, engage in construction, and strive for prosperity and strength. Therefore, they spare no effort to purchase it with their hard-earned money. Under today's circumstances, the holders of various public bonds are spread throughout the country and have a great relationship with the livelihood of the people and social security. It is not just a matter for a part of the people or a part of the groups. The previous price of bonds rose and fell, but it was only a temporary phenomenon. This year, internal and external troubles have come one after another, and the price of bonds has fallen from 80% to 30-40%, and it has not stopped yet. More than half of the national property has been lost, and people's hearts are in extreme doubt. If we do not try to remedy it quickly, the national economic panic and the unemployment of the common people will create an opportunity for the communists. After the reorganization of the government, all facilities will be impossible to start. No country in the world, other than communist countries, regardless of how difficult their finances and economy are, would ever destroy the credit of their national debt on its own. Because once the credit of the debt is destroyed, construction will be impossible to raise funds, and it will inevitably be driven into communism. Therefore, once the national debt loses its value, all national property loses its value. The loss is not only to the holders of national debt, and its relationship is not only in finance and economics, but even the inherent doctrines and policies must be fundamentally overthrown. Therefore, to prevent the growth of communism, we must never arbitrarily destroy the credit of the national debt and trap the national economy in a dead end. This is the general trend of the world economy, the division between communism and non-communism. All of our people must truly recognize this in advance. What the heart feels is dangerous, how can we remain silent? We should ask your seat (the Executive Yuan) to give attention to this and to never adopt any proposals to change the national debt. Please issue a clear statement in advance to stabilize the people's hearts and restore the credit of the debt. We are anxiously awaiting your orders. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Lin of the National Government and Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Telegraph from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the plenary session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee yesterday, saying, "To the honorable members of the plenary session of the Fourth Central Committee in Nanjing: We have heard that at this meeting, someone proposed that the central government should earnestly consult with the financial community, taking into account the central government's financial difficulties and the scope of maintaining the credit of public bonds, and find ways to extend the payment of principal and interest on public bonds. If this proposal is implemented, the national commercial finance will be in danger of bankruptcy. We are deeply alarmed. We have found that our country's public bonds, such as the Yuan Eight Second Public Bonds and the Nine Six Public Bonds, have become waste paper because of the postponement of principal and interest payments. The market price of one is only about 10%. It can be asserted that the result of the proposed extension of payment of principal and interest on public bonds is that the prices of various public bonds will inevitably be reduced to the continuation of the Nine Six Public Bonds. Since the Japanese started the war and the political situation became tense, the price of public bonds has plummeted, and the huge losses suffered by the financial industry have almost broken all records. The reason why it can still make up for the security of the evening and has not broken down is that the government has announced its credit, and each period of principal and interest can still be paid to barely support the dangerous situation. Now, if there is another proposal to extend the payment of principal and interest, it is no different from fueling the flames. The result will only be that everyone will be dragged down together. Since the government has repeatedly issued domestic public bonds, the number is almost 700-800 million. Not only is it popular in the national financial industry, but also charitable organizations use it as a fund, and the people's livelihood depends on it for maintenance. If public bonds cannot maintain credit, not only will there be panic in the national finance, but the maintenance of charitable undertakings and the resources of the national livelihood will be exhausted immediately. This kind of measure is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst. It is known without deep thought that it is impossible. As for adjusting national finances, we should start by eliminating the interception of tax revenue in various places and reducing government and military expenses. If we can unify political power and strictly adhere to the budget, then there should not be no way to solve the financial problems. There are many complicated matters in this matter, and officials and the people can jointly form a financial conference to discuss the progress together. We must not seek temporary convenience and cut off the source of national livelihood to supply military and political expenses, so as to destroy the credit of the country in the future to adjust the budget and issue new bonds, and trap the national economy in an irredeemable position. We hope that you will investigate and implement it. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Declaration by Trade Associations: More than 160 trade associations in this city issued a declaration yesterday opposing the proposal by a certain Central Committee member to extend the payment of principal and interest on public bonds, saying, "The violent sun is rampant, disasters are everywhere, and internal and external troubles are invading each other. Although the people are doing their best to cry out and lament, the government has not yet shown any progress. Our merchants and people are determined to sever economic relations with Japan. Under the non-resistance policy of the authorities, it is the only weapon for the people to resist Japan. They are determined to break the boat and devote themselves to the work of resisting Japanese goods. For example, all the old Japanese goods that have been imported are sealed up. The total amount is in the tens of millions. Although the money is becoming tighter and the financial situation is becoming more dangerous, for the sake of solid resistance to Japanese goods, we would rather suffer extreme sacrifices and maintain the normal state of sealing. The depth of the suffering cannot be described. Recently, we heard that a certain Central Committee member has proposed to extend the payment of principal and interest on public bonds. We were extremely surprised and puzzled. We have found that the people have borne more than 100 million public bonds and treasury bills in the past four or five years. In peacetime, the people are eager to govern and are happy to purchase them. Although the amount of debt has plummeted due to political factors, and it can still be paid principal and interest on schedule, the people's hearts will not be confused to the extreme. Now, if we lose even this lowest level of credit for repaying principal and paying interest, at this time when the end of the year is approaching and the money is extremely tight, the severity of the disaster and the depth of the harm are really difficult to predict. Financial institutions will be the first to bear the brunt and will be unable to cope. The people across the country who rely on principal and interest income for their livelihood will inevitably declare bankruptcy and perish together. This is not waiting for the violent sun to destroy us, but we have destroyed ourselves. Our association, etc., are afraid to remain silent because of what the heart feels is dangerous. We believe that anyone who proposes to extend the repayment of principal and interest on public bonds is a culprit who destroys the national economy, and the people across the country can attack him with drums. We hereby declare this, and we hope that you will be aware of it. Shanghai Municipal Gut Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Medicinal Materials Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Chinese Medicine Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Pollen Industry Association, Shanghai North-South Goods Dismantling Exchange Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Seafood Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Silk and Satin Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Flying Flower Industry Association, Shanghai Silk-Cotton Textile Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Sand and Stone Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Color Printing Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Cotton Cloth Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Coal Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Fur Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Shoe Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Sugar Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Mineral Ash Factory Industry Association, etc., more than 160 associations jointly declare."</p>
<p>Telegrams from the Woodware Industry, etc.: The Shanghai Municipal Chinese and Western Woodware Dealers Association and the Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Industry Association telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, saying, "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee: Your Association is holding a meeting in the capital in the autumn of national crisis and after peaceful reunification. You are scheduled to have many plans for domestic politics, foreign affairs, and economy, so as to stabilize the country and resist foreign aggression. Unexpectedly, at the time when the violent sun has not yet returned the occupied land and is launching a large-scale attack on Jinzhou, news has come that there is a case of stopping the principal and interest of domestic public bonds and treasury bills. If it becomes a reality, the bonds will immediately become waste paper, and the credit of the Chinese National Party's government will be completely overthrown. Those who hold principal and interest to live and hold bonds to operate funds will all become dried carp. The interests are concerned, and we urgently telegraph this to you, and we are looking forward to your clear instructions so as to stabilize the people's hearts and maintain the national credit. Yang Guangxing, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chinese and Western Woodware Dealers Association, Zhang Yichen, Chairman of the Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Industry Association."</p>
<p>Telegram from the Lixue United Association: The Shanghai Lixue United Association telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, saying, "To the Nanjing Chinese Kuomintang Fourth First Central Executive Supervision Committee: We are horrified to read in the newspaper that your Association has a proposal to stop paying the principal and interest on domestic public bonds and treasury bills. We have found that domestic public bonds and treasury bills have reliable funds and outstanding credit. The principal and interest are paid on schedule in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, Lixue people are vying to purchase them as a stable investment, and they receive principal and interest to support their lives. If this proposal is put forward and passed, the life and death of Lixue people will be judged immediately. We are asking the Party's government, which is calling for representing the interests of the people and liberating the suffering of the people, not to take this step of destroying the people's livelihood and destroying its credit with the people. We are telegraphing you especially to clearly announce the truth so as to stabilize the people's hearts.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Statement: The National News Agency said that Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, told the National News Agency reporter yesterday that the (Declaration on National Financial Issues) issued by the Federation yesterday was to urge the government to pay attention to debt credit and to awaken the people to pay attention to debt rights. The public bonds and treasury bills held by the financial community average only one-fifth. The majority of the bondholders are still very common merchants. Therefore, if the principal and interest on the bonds are extended for payment, the first to bear the brunt will definitely not be the financial community, but the majority of merchants. Because financial institutions, such as banks, are well prepared and will not endanger the entire business or part of the money because of the bonds that are part of their business. I am deeply afraid that the outside world will misunderstand the wording in yesterday's declaration, so I have to make this solemn statement again.</p>

<p>Public announcement to bondholders, hoping to work together</p>
<p>The Chinese Republic Domestic Public Bond Treasury Bill Holders Association has formally announced its establishment after finding a place for the association yesterday. The news about the association's progress is recorded below.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the First Central Committee: "To the Nanjing Chinese Kuomintang Central Executive Supervisory Committee: Rumors say that this meeting will have a proposal to extend the payment of principal and interest on public bonds and treasury bills. The people's hearts are panicked to the extreme. Just having this kind of proposal has caused the credit of bonds to plummet. If it becomes a resolution, the national credit will be completely lost, and public and private economies will be completely bankrupt. No government can continue. We urgently telegraph this, and we hope that you will make a clear announcement to stabilize the people's hearts and stabilize the national credit. Sincerely, the Chinese Republic Domestic Public Bond Treasury Bill Holders Association."</p>

<h3>He Xiangning's Views on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Central Committee member He Xiangning issued her views on the current situation, saying, "It has been many years since the National Revolutionary Army set out on the Northern Expedition. The tangible warlords have been overthrown, but the intangible warlords have been replaced and produced. The old-style bureaucrats seem to have been driven out, but the new-style bureaucrats have become more intensified. Years of civil war have caused our people to suffer heavily, their essence has been lost, and their vitality has been lost. Revolution is advocated every day, but the revolution has not been successful. Unification is sung by everyone, but unification is difficult to achieve. Today, the task of saving the country and saving the people has not been completed, but instead has invited foreign insults. Everything that was not seen in the autocratic era and under the warlord politics is seen in today's revolutionary upsurge. In the past, countless fresh blood was sacrificed, and the current result is like this. In this era of the 20th century, recalling the history of more than 4,000 years, I am deeply saddened. However, the reason why this is the case is not the fault of the revolution, but the fault of a group of pseudo-revolutionaries. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of our party, separated (power) and (ability) in the principle of the people's rights of the Three Principles of the People. Power belongs to the people, and ability belongs to the government, so that all measures and actions of the government are subject to the supervision of the people, so that those in power dare not abuse their power, indulge their ambitions, and act arbitrarily, so as to harm the people. If Sun Yat-sen's claim of separating power and ability can be implemented, then the people will have the power to remove all corrupt officials. The people will have the power to stop the endless wars. The people will have the power to order the government to eliminate the excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes that make the people unable to bear the burden. The people will have the right to criticize the bureaucrats who are despicable and love to stir up trouble with extreme freedom in public opinion. The people will have the right to remove or warn those in power who are incompetent or lazy. The people will have the right to resist the foolishness and weakness of diplomacy. The people will have the right to resist or remove the laws that are contrary to the majority of the people's wishes. In addition, the people have the absolute right to supervise all income and expenditure of national and local finances, and the government's actions and facilities that are not satisfactory to the people, so that the people's will can be expressed, and those in power dare not act arbitrarily. The people can have the right to supervise the government, and then the political situation will have the hope of improvement by gradually implementing the four powers of election (removal), (creation), and (referendum). Therefore, for me, He Xiangning, my opinion on today's domestic affairs and resisting foreign aggression is to first advocate the implementation of the right to remove officials in the principle of the people's rights set by Sun Yat-sen, so that the people can make suggestions and implement everything to the government according to their will. For example, if local officials collect excessive taxes or are corrupt and irresponsible, the people should be allowed to impeach them, reform them, or implement their removal. Secondly, in all provinces, cities, and counties across the country, where there are administrative organs, the Party and all parties, factions, non-party, and non-faction, and the gentlemen, farmers, merchants, women, soldiers, and people of each province, city, and county shall form a (People's Supervisory Committee) themselves. If the association elects people from all parties and factions who have not violated the law (the standard for violating the law should be based on the true will of the people), the government shall not remove its powers to supervise the behavior of the local governor. Supervisors shall not participate in any administrative organs or serve as officials) and judge their merits and demerits based on the true will of the people (anyone with an official position cannot participate in the Supervisory Committee). All matters that should be done and should be reformed locally shall be discussed and reformed by the local people and the local government. In recent years, there have been many natural disasters and man-made disasters in various places, and many people have died. Many brave and promising young people have also been sacrificed due to political relations. For example, Deng Yanda, who used to work hard in the revolution, was a promising and brave young man, but he was shot dead. Is it not too unloving of talents and too cruel? At this time of national crisis, people's lives should be cherished, so as to go to the national crisis together and resist Japanese imperialism. Therefore, political prisoners should be released to fight against the violent sun. After He Xiangning returned to China, in view of the national people's enthusiastic and激暴 patriotic movement, there are also some things that I cannot help but say. The Republic of China is composed of 400 million Chinese people. It is not a country of a few people in the government, but a country of 400 million people. The government is just its servant. If we do not resist foreign insults and lead to destruction, it is to destroy the country of the entire nation and make them feel pain. The people are running around and calling for the patriotic movement to love China, which has a history of thousands of years, and to love China, which was created by their ancestors through thorns and hardships. Their enthusiasm is commendable. Now, the violent sun is pressing on me step by step, and a certain country has also stationed troops in Annam, threatening to spy on my Yunnan and Guangxi. My country is really in danger. Now, students across the country have formed volunteer armies and are receiving military training. Awakened people have also spontaneously formed self-saving groups, demanding that the government declare war on Japan. If the government can carefully adopt their sincerity and give them strict military training, so that they can hold weapons to defend the country, then my great China will definitely not be repeatedly trampled on by imperialism. Recalling the vigorousness of my party and the people's spirit in the 14th year, and gaining the sympathy of the weak and small nations, so that the strong neighbors dared not humiliate me, compared with today, it is really different. Looking at all countries, when there is a national crisis, most of them implement conscription, and the whole country is armed to defend it. Why can't my country follow suit? Sun Yat-sen led the National Revolution to save China. Today, when foreign invaders are deepening, the people should rise up to overthrow Japanese imperialism. I hope that the government will have a proper study of this and give guidance, so as not to fail the people's enthusiasm, so that the people will not be disappointed. As for democratic politics, I also have some opinions to contribute. I believe that people's livelihood politics should follow the majority of the people's will. Where is the majority of the people's will? Which boundary has the most people? This should be studied and paid attention to. Only when the people truly have power can democratic politics be realized and the goal of the National Revolution can be achieved. To seek freedom and equality for China, if the people's rights are not realized, the National Revolution cannot succeed. Recently, some people have advocated that people's groups organize representative organs to discuss diplomacy together, and some have advocated that this organ should be permanently retained. There are also opinions that the location of the organ should be in Shanghai. However, although Shanghai is a convenient transportation hub, where merchants gather, and where finance is concentrated, the population only accounts for a small number of the national population. The pain of the villagers and small iron people is even deeper, and their desire for happiness is even stronger. If they truly seek the welfare of the people, it is not just the corner of Shanghai. Wouldn't that argument be wrong? Therefore, each province, city, and county across the country should also have supervisory organs, so as to collect the opinions of the majority of the people and relieve the pain of the majority. I believe that the current anti-Japanese work, the positive is to declare war, and the negative is to permanently sever economic relations with it. Internally, we should earnestly support farmers and workers and develop commerce. Then we can hope that China will be among the strong. After the East Three Provinces incident, the situation in our country has become increasingly serious. I believe that to confront Japanese imperialism, the people of our country should work together. It is also necessary to unite with the weak and small nations of the world and work together with the nations that treat me equally. Because the imperialists' invasion of the weak and small nations is a sympathetic response. Sun Yat-sen had a great vision and knew that to overthrow imperialism, it was necessary to unite with the weak and small nations and fight together. Therefore, his will said to unite with the nations of the world that treat me equally and fight together. My country is an oppressed nation, and if we cannot sympathize with other weak and small nations, then we cannot unite to overthrow imperialism. At this time when the national crisis is in full swing and foreign insults are urgent, my compatriots across the country are doing their best to raise funds to discuss ways to save the country. I would like to offer my humble opinion to the elders, brothers, and sisters across the country, hoping that they will study and discuss it. I am listed as a member of the Central Committee, and I ask myself that my virtue is thin and my ability is weak. I have nothing to offer to the party and the country, and I have nothing to benefit the people. I feel ashamed. From now on, I will resolutely resign from my post as a member of the Central Committee and concentrate on running social charitable undertakings to fulfill my responsibility as a citizen.</p>

<h3>Another Large Donation to Support Ma</h3>
<p>The National Medical Association Donates 1,400 Yuan. Considering General Ma Zhanshan's lone army resisting the bandits and his admirable loyalty, the National Medical Association remitted 1,400 yuan in national currency through the Bank of China yesterday to express their sympathy and support. They also sent a telegram, saying: "To Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Hailun, Greetings. The Japanese bandits are tyrannical and forcibly occupy our territory. You, General, lead a lone army to resist the stubborn enemy. Your loyalty and courage are admired and felt by the whole country. Our association has respectfully collected 1,400 yuan and remitted it through the Bank of China for the needs of the army. We hope you will stay true to your original intention and reply by telegram. The Shanghai National Medical Association respectfully salutes you."</p>
<p>People in the Telegraph Industry Remit Another 1,000 Yuan. The national telegraph industry colleagues have raised funds to support Heilongjiang. Previously, they had successively remitted 2,000 yuan in silver. Now, they entrusted the Bank of China to telegraph another 1,000 yuan in silver. It is also heard that the colleagues in the industry are still raising funds, hoping to continue remitting. The exchange of telegrams between the colleagues and Chairman Ma are recorded as follows: (Incoming Telegram) "To the National Telegraph Industry Public Welfare Association of China, Greetings. We received your telegram. Thank you for your praise and generous donation. Your patriotic sincerity is deeply appreciated. I respectfully lead my troops to express our gratitude. Our government has now moved to Hailun. Your donation has been assigned to someone to go to Harbin to arrange for transfer. Signed, Ma Zhanshan, with the seal of the cold." (Outgoing Telegram) "To Chairman Ma of Hailun, Greetings. We received your telegram. Our association remitted another 1,000 yuan in silver through the Bank of China on the [day] of this month and telegraphed it on the same day, which should have been received. Today, we remitted another 1,000 yuan in silver for the third time through the bank. Please check and reply. We will continue to remit when we have collected a sufficient amount. Signed, The National Telegraph Industry Public Welfare Association."</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Responds to Wang Jingwei's Telegram</h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang's telegram to Wang Jingwei said, "Mr. Jingwei, Greetings. After reading your telegram, I learned that you advocate that various entities elect representatives to organize a national salvation conference to jointly face the national crisis. After reading it repeatedly, I admire it very much. At this time of urgent foreign troubles, we must concentrate the power of the people of the whole country to unanimously resist foreign aggression in order to save the country. The support of diplomacy lies not only in military force, but also in the people's spirit. The revival of Turkey and the recovery of the Hankou Concession prove that the military force at that time could not surpass the military preparations of the imperialist powers. Therefore, I hope that this national salvation conference can be successfully concluded as soon as possible, uniting the strength of 400 million compatriots to jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the country. Perhaps the public will be the foundation of the diplomatic front. If the whole country is of one mind, it will be possible to realize national diplomacy and the opportunity for revival lies in this one move. I am willing to work with you to plan it."</p>
<p>After the Economic Embargo</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of Transportation and Shipping</h3>
<p>Losses of Japanese Ships in Four Months</p>
<p>Totaling 97 Million</p>
<p>Since the Japanese troops forcibly occupied our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, Chinese people going to the Northeast to purchase goods have been interrupted, and the financial situation in Shenyang is extremely chaotic. The Japanese are bundling up cash from the Eastern Provinces and taking it away, causing a cash shortage in Liaoning and Shenyang. Since November, Liaoning and Shenyang have come to Shanghai to purchase cash and transport it to the city to circulate money. The Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank and British and American banks in this port have been buying cash on behalf of them in Shanghai and handing it over to a certain Japanese ship affiliated to the South Manchuria Railway to load it and transport it to Dalian, and then transfer it to Shenyang's national currency. In these four weeks, more than 3 million yuan have been transported away. It is currently still being transported. It is heard that the next shift (around Friday), a certain Japanese ship will leave Shanghai, and there will be another 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in cash loaded to Dalian, and then transferred to Liaoning.</p>
<p>American Cotton Transported to Shanghai. Since our country's economic embargo against Japan, the products of various spinning mills in Japan have not been sold to China. The American cotton purchased by various factories has greatly reduced demand due to the sharp reduction in shipments. The ginned cotton that has already been shipped out of the United States has been transshipped to Shanghai and resold to various yarn factories and weaving factories in China. In these two months, more than 420,000 pieces have arrived, and they are still being loaded. Today and tomorrow, 29,000 pieces of American cotton imported by the Shun Heng Shipping Company in this port will arrive in Shanghai. From today, within four weeks, the company will have seven more cotton transport ships, carrying about 100,000 pieces. In these four weeks, more than 100,000 pieces will be loaded and transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Losses. The Japanese Shipowners Association investigated that after our country's boycott of Japanese ships, the business losses on near-sea and ocean routes amounted to 60 million Japanese yen, as reported in this newspaper. The association has now announced that the above losses are only the direct damage of reduced income from freight and passenger fares. There are also indirect and intangible losses, such as the reduced freight rates when ships are idle and dispatched, which amount to 23.35 million Japanese yen. In total, the losses suffered by Japanese ships since September 18th, both domestically and abroad, and in other ways, amount to 97 million yen. The compensation for laid-off crew members and dismissed sailors, such as severance pay, has not yet been issued, so it is not included.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between the Rice Industry and the Anti-Japanese Association</h3>
<p>Demanding Five Measures</p>
<p>At around 1:00 PM yesterday, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association found that the Yuanchangxin Rice Store in Wanjuma Wharf, Nanshi, was selling rice to Japanese merchants, so they detained Chen Dexiang, a partner of the store, along with more than 40 account books and took them back to the association. The store reported the matter to the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and asked for instructions. The association considered the matter important and immediately convened an emergency meeting of the industry at the association's general office in Cuixiutang, Fuyou Road, at around 3:00 PM that afternoon. Dozens of companies from the north and south cities attended the meeting. The meeting was held as usual. First, Chairman Kuai Huijun reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Chen Bingqian, the manager of Yuanchangxin Rice Store, stated the situation at the time, saying: "At around 12:00 PM last night, two inspectors from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association, Song and others, came and claimed that our store had sold 30 bags of rice to Japanese merchants on October 13th of this year. Because our store has never had any dealings with Japanese merchants, we took out all the account books for them to check. As a result, these 30 bags of rice were purchased by our store from Taicheng Rice Store and sold to Jin [?] Rice Store in Guangqi Road in the city on October 13th of this year. Our store has never traded with Japanese merchants. The facts are there. Unexpectedly, the inspectors suddenly said that they had to take all the account books to the Anti-Japanese Association for review. Because the account books are related to the business of the store, we could not allow it. The inspectors left in anger. An hour later, the inspectors suddenly gathered more than a dozen companions, drove a car, and rushed to our store. Without asking why, they searched all over the store downstairs, but found no evidence. They then tried to pry open the silver box, took out more than 40 account books stored inside, and planned to take them away. Chen Dexiang, a partner of our store, stepped forward to stop them, but was brutally beaten, and even a piece of glass was broken. Soon, they twisted Chen Dexiang, along with the account books, and pushed him into the car and sped away. This kind of action by the association has a great impact on the future of the industry. Please discuss it among the industry colleagues." Representatives from companies such as Yongfeng, Hefeng, Xiefeng, Qianchang, Zhouyitai, etc. reported that similar incidents had occurred, and account books had been confiscated by the Anti-Japanese Association and have not been returned. After repeated discussions, the colleagues decided: (1) The association will first send a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association, requesting that the account books taken from Yongfeng and others and the detained partner be released immediately. (2) If the association does not resolve the matter satisfactorily, the association will not be responsible for any unfortunate incidents that occur to the industry colleagues. (3) According to this resolution, submit it to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting effective protection, and announce the facts to the people of the country. It was also decided to demand five measures from the Anti-Japanese Association: (1) The account books of the industry colleagues that have been taken away must be returned immediately, and Chen Dexiang, who was detained, must be released immediately. (2) Hand over the perpetrators to the authorities for severe punishment according to law. (3) Be responsible for compensating all losses suffered by the affected industry colleagues this time. (4) Guarantee that the same incident will not happen again in the future. (5) In the future, when checking account books, the association personnel must jointly check with the personnel of this association. (6) The aforementioned measures must be resolved satisfactorily within two days, otherwise, the entire industry will unanimously stop trading, and the responsibility shall be borne entirely by your association. The meeting adjourned after the decision was made.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Japanese Association Urges Yan E'sheng to Stay</h3>

The Secretariat is the general hub of all departments of the association, and the progress of association affairs is extremely important. Since you took office, you have been virtuous, hardworking, and outstanding, and we rely on you deeply.

They can now communicate smoothly day and night. Therefore, all incoming and outgoing Shanghai-Harbin telegrams can now be sent and received as soon as they arrive, which is extremely fast.

<h3>Yan Wan Strictly Prohibits Illegal Organizations</h3>

<p>The Citywide Workers' Representative Assembly</p>
<h3>Submitting a Document to the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citywide Workers' Representative Assembly's document to the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee said: "Submitting this document to earnestly state the resolutions of the meeting and request your approval for implementation. Since the Shenyang Incident, the leaders of our Party and the people of the whole country have been deeply indignant and have been planning sincere unity to jointly resist foreign aggression. The First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee of our Party opened, abandoning defects, accommodating facts, and making jointly addressing internal and external troubles as the highest goal. Our city currently has 70+ organized labor unions, with 800,000+ workers. We have a deep understanding of the national crisis and uphold the responsibility of the people. Therefore, on the 19th of this month, we held a citywide workers' representative assembly in the Postal Workers' Union. More than 200 representatives from 71 labor unions attended. The atmosphere of the whole venue was enthusiastic. The following proposals were passed on the spot: (1) Supporting the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee's plan to improve the party and government organization. Its principles are: 1. The Party should be based on the principle of democratic centralism, and future organizations and facilities should be absolutely democratized, and should never use any name to repeat the past mistakes of dictatorship. 2. The Party should be based on the people and should be closely integrated with the people in order to enrich itself and realize the responsibility of leading the people to carry out the doctrine. 3. The Party is the biggest driving force for the national political platform, and all political and military affairs should be subject to the Party's control in order to implement the main purpose of governing the country by the Party. 4. Party and government officials should not hold concurrent positions to avoid the drawbacks of the Party hindering politics or politics invading the Party. (2) The mass movement should be guided by the Party, but its independence and freedom must be respected. (3) Rectifying the labor movement. Its principles are: 1. Improve the status of workers and protect workers' organizations. 2. Abolish the current Labor Union Law and all labor laws and regulations, and re-enact the Labor Union Law and labor laws and regulations that truly protect workers' organizations based on the Union Organization Regulations personally drafted by the President in 1924, and formally appoint representatives from the labor community to attend and participate in opinions. 3. Labor organizations have vertical and horizontal organizations and help them establish. 4. Workers must not be distinguished or discriminated against by knowledge, occupation, or service organization, and should all have the right to organize a labor union. 5. The government authorities should earnestly provide relief to unemployed workers. 6. Recognize that workers have the absolute right to strike freely. 7. Restore the original organizations of various labor unions and trade unions between 1929 and 1930. 8. Assist unorganized workers to organize unions. (4) Regarding the diplomatic aspect, requesting the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee to address two points, namely: 1. Determine the policy towards Japan, and implement revolutionary diplomacy to restore national rights and territories. 2. Order the military commanders in charge to recover the lost territories by force. 3. Earnestly implement the resolutions of the peace conference and respect public opinion to reform the party and government plan. (5) Use the name of the conference to telegraph workers around the world, announcing the brutality of the violent Japanese and all kinds of acts of sabotaging world peace, in order to awaken the sympathy and assistance of various countries. (6) The establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipal Federation of Trade Unions requests the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee to specifically file it for record, so that it can be united in good faith to jointly deal with the national crisis. Now that the conference is opened, the workers of the city are rejoicing and leaping, and we will combine the proceedings of the meeting and the main resolutions into a document and submit it to your meeting for review. We hope that you will have pity for the national crisis, follow public opinion, and approve the filing and implementation. Shanghai Citywide Workers' Representative Assembly respectfully presents, Presidium Chuan Dewei, Zhu Xuefan, Yu Xianting, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Yongxiang, December 23rd, 20th year of the Republic of China,"</p>
<h3>The National Salvation Society of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>Statement Regarding Jiao Yitang's Remarks</p>
<p>The National Salvation Society of the Republic of China sent a letter, saying: "According to reports yesterday, when Central Committee member Jiao Yitang arrived in Shanghai, he made remarks about the organization of the National Salvation Society, the content of which was nothing more than that the Chinese National Salvation Society intends to organize a general association in Shanghai and set up branches in various provinces and counties. In order to avoid confusion, our society makes the following statement: (1) The name of our association is (National Salvation Society of the Republic of China). After the Northeast Incident occurred this year, it was prepared in Shanghai for a long time and was officially established. It was reported and telegraphed on November 8th. Representatives Wu Mulan, Tang San, Lu Qiwen, Lin Kecong, Li Zhenya, Chen Tie'an, Li Boying, Yuan Jie, Li Jieqing, Zhang Fan, Wu Daonan, etc. were sent to Ning and Yue to engage in petitions. In terms of historical relationship, our association should be regarded as the first to be established. (3) Regarding the organization of the National Salvation Societies in various provinces and regions, our association members have been dispatched to their native places to jointly plan with the local party departments and mass organizations of the provinces and regions. (3) Our association believes that in the sound of national crisis, there should not be two organizations with the same name. From the national standpoint of saving the country, it is not comparable to the seizure of rights, but in order to maintain the organizational system, we must not have to make a statement. (4) The so-called (Chinese National Salvation Society) of Mr. Jiao Yitang was initiated after Mr. Wang Jingwei sent the telegram. Our association dispatched comrades to travel around and call out for the people before Mr. Wang sent the telegram, in order to awaken the people and jointly deal with the national crisis. The whole country knows this. At the same time, it is attached to the statement that since the establishment of our association, we have each contributed to saving the country with one heart, and there is absolutely no political function. Mr. Jiao is a member of the Central Committee and should be requested to guide our association in his capacity as a member, so as to benefit the process. We believe that Mr. Jiao must have sympathy as well.</p>
<h3>The Third Anniversary of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third anniversary of the establishment of the Trademark Bureau. The bureau held a commemorative ceremony on that day and compiled a report on the work achievements over the years, including the following major points: (1) Regarding trademark matters, a total of 17,222 items have been registered, 1,681 items have been reviewed and announced but have not yet expired, 303 cases of resolving objections and evaluations have been completed, and other letters and approval orders amount to approximately 28,086 items, for a total of 47,292 items processed. (2) Regarding the revision of the Trademark Law, the old Trademark Law had been promulgated for many years, and there were many inconveniences in application. A draft was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for correction and promulgation in May of last year. The implementation rules were also submitted to the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce for amendment and were implemented on January 1st of this year, which is convenient for both Chinese and foreign parties. (3) Regarding the unification of trademark administrative matters, the Guangdong trademark cases were received by the bureau in June of 1929, and regulations were drafted and submitted to the ministry for promulgation and continued processing. This item has now been processed completely. 4. Regarding the promotion of domestic products, the domestic trademark approvals over the years have been compiled and printed in two issues of the "Domestic Product Trademark Gazette". The content of the gazette has been revised and updated, and those who continue to register have been added and recompiled into the "Domestic Product Trademark First Compilation" in order to arouse the attention of the domestic industrial and commercial circles and promote the development of domestic products. Director Wen of the bureau also encouraged all staff to continue their efforts during the commemorative ceremony to achieve the goal of assisting the development of industrial and commercial enterprises.</p>

<h3>The Pacific International Business Conference</h3>
<p>Will be Held in May Next Year</p>
<p>In Honolulu</p>
<p>The American Pacific International Business Conference will be held in Honolulu in May next year. According to the information received by the American Commercial Counselor in this port, Mr. An Lide, from the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce, the authorities are preparing everything to ensure that the meeting opens on time. The Secretary-General of the conference, Mr. Davis, rushed from New York to Honolulu at the beginning of this month to arrange the conference agenda and reception procedures for representatives from various places. It is reported that the task of the meeting focuses on various Pacific commercial issues, and specific time will be set to discuss trade issues with China.

<p>French Concession</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Next Year's Budget</h3>
<p>Balance Achieved in Regular Expenses</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that the French Concession Public Works Bureau's 1932 budget has achieved a balance in regular expenses. It is estimated that within an income of 5.7 million taels, after deducting expenses, there will still be a surplus of over 5,000 taels. It is noted that the Public Works Bureau's income will decrease compared to previous years. For example, the income from the Mixed Court has no longer belonged to the Public Works Bureau since it was handed over on August 1st of this year. Similarly, the wharfage dues have also been greatly affected since the implementation of the new Chinese-foreign distribution method on May 1st. Furthermore, the Gujiazhai Radio Station's cessation of commercial broadcasting on July 15th has also reduced income. Not only will there be a decrease in income next year, but expenditures will also increase, such as the appropriate increases in salaries for Chinese and foreign staff, the interest payable on the two new public bonds this year, and the payment of garbage removal fees to the Chinese authorities. All of these will increase the burden on the municipal treasury. Therefore, to balance revenue and expenditure next year, it is necessary to slightly increase taxes to compensate. It is reported that the budget plan proposes to implement a new land price assessment in the concession inland from the second half of the year, and also increase the police tax by two percent, from thirteen to fifteen percent. Furthermore, license fees for hotels, inns, wine shops, cafes, restaurants, dance halls, etc., will increase by 25 percent. The license fees for brothels and singing girls will increase by five yuan per quarter. All retail liquor stores must obtain licenses by paying dues. License fees for public garages will also increase. In addition, there will be slight revisions to several other tax rates. Overall, in this environment, the budget can be considered sound.</p>
<p>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau</p>
<h3>Haiying Patrol Ship Patrolling and Suppressing Pirates</h3>
<p>Since his appointment, Han Yougang, Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, has been determined to protect fisheries. He has repeatedly captured pirates during the summer and autumn seasons, which has been praised by fishermen. Currently, during the winter fishing season, the threat of pirates is even more intense, and patrols cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Therefore, even though the bureau is facing extreme financial difficulties, it is still making every effort to intensify its fishery protection work. In order to supervise and urge the various ships under his command to carry out their duties, Director Han personally went to the outer seas of Zhejiang at the end of last month to inspect them for a week, and strictly ordered the "Haiying," "Hai," "Qing'an," and "Biaohai" patrol ships to intensify patrols at all times. According to a report from the Haiying patrol ship, at 9:00 AM on the 17th of this month, when the ship was patrolling outside Jishuimen in Shipu, Zhejiang, it encountered a suspicious ship. The ship was ordered to stop for inspection, but the pirates, seeing the situation was unfavorable, resisted and fled. The Haiying patrol ship pursued them vigorously, and after a standoff of three hours, the pirates could not hold on any longer and fled ashore. Several pirates were killed and many were wounded. In addition, a captured fishing boat and a Ningbo Island sand barge were rescued, as well as twenty to thirty refugees. It is said that after this attack, the pirates in the surrounding waters have fled far away after hearing the news.</p>

<h3>Cultural Organizations Form a Joint Association</h3>
<p>Discussion Meeting at the World and China Society</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, various organizations have been forming anti-Japanese associations, united in their opposition to foreign aggression. Shanghai is the cultural center of the country, and cultural organizations are the vanguard of leading the people. However, a joint association of cultural organizations is still lacking. In view of this, the World and China Society initiated the association. Members already include the Liuhuo Monthly Society, the Literature and Art News Society, the Reading Magazine Society, the People's Voice Weekly, and the China News Agency, all organized by famous scholars and university professors in Shanghai. A discussion meeting was held at the World and China Society on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 7:00 PM. The main purpose is to oppose imperialist military aggression against foreign countries and call on all countries regarding the recent Japanese attack on Jinzhou. Domestically, they request absolute freedom of speech, publication, and association. The date of the general meeting is set for the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3>Mingde Principal's Embezzlement of Donation Case</h3>
<p>Thoroughly Investigated by the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Embezzled Over 2,100 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the "Guomin She", the students of the Sixth District Party Headquarters and Mingde Middle School have successively reported that Wu Mengyan, the principal of Mingde School, embezzled donations from all circles to General Ma Zhanshan. The details of the case, as reported in various newspapers previously, were not very clear. It has now been thoroughly investigated by Zhao Erchang, a member of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters. The results of the audit show that the principal embezzled a total of 2,117.10 yuan from the donations, which has been reported to the Municipal Executive Committee for review. The details are as follows: (Sole Proprietorship) All procedures for the fundraising were handled by the principal. Donation tubes were added at any time. The student association's seal was kept by the principal, and the filled tubes were also kept by the principal. The entire arrangement made it easy to manipulate things. (Adding Printed Cards) The school's broken tubes were after 10:00 PM on November 23, but on November 25, Xu Qiong Zhang, the female teacher, added various cards in the Four Horses Road in the Minyi printing house, fifty sheets of paper worth five yuan, one thousand sheets of paper for one yuan, one thousand sheets of paper for four cents, two thousand sheets of paper for two cents each. What is the use of these cards? It is self-evident. Moreover, the school principal did not mention additional printing in previous investigations. It was not until the officials of the Municipal Party Committee held the card paper voucher to the school that they began to tell the truth. This is a planned fraud, which is clearly obvious. (Embezzlement is Real) According to the school, the total number of cards printed, minus the cards used, is equal to the remaining cards. The remaining cards verify the cards used, converted into donations, should be 3,999.50 yuan, but the principal announced that it was only 1,782.40 yuan. In comparison, the difference is 2,117.10 yuan. The number of 2,117.10 yuan is the amount embezzled by the principal.</p>
<p>Accused of Murdering Her Husband</p>
<h3>Woman's Appeal Deemed Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Police Lawyer Dissatisfied</p>
<p>Remanded During Appeal Period</p>
<p>Zhu Zhang, a local woman and owner of the Nanyang Department Store at No. 100 Yangzhou Road, had a minor dispute with her husband, Zhu Shisheng, over funeral arrangements for a daughter around 6:00 PM on June 24th of this year. Zhu, who was elderly, suddenly suffered from a burst blood vessel and died despite medical treatment. Her son-in-law, Zhang Xingsheng, reported the incident to the Yangshupu Police Station, alleging that she had beaten him to death. She was detained and handed over to the First Special District Court, where she was sentenced to life imprisonment. Zhu Zhang was dissatisfied and hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to file an appeal. The interrogation has concluded, and the verdict is pending. Yesterday afternoon, Criminal Court President Song Yuan, accompanied by investigators Du and Gao, arrived at the First Court and ruled that the original judgment was revoked and Zhu Zhang was not guilty. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that he was dissatisfied and requested that she be remanded during the appeal period. The court approved it. Fuli Road</p>
<h3>Private Counterfeit Money Printing Operation Broken Up</h3>
<p>The Western Detective of the French General Police Station stated that there have been cases of counterfeit money being used in the concession recently. However, the printing operations are set up very secretly, making it difficult to break them up, which has a significant impact on the financial market. Therefore, he specially instructed all Chinese and foreign detectives to pay close attention to the investigation and arrest of the suspects. Jin Jiulin, a special detective inspector of the French Police Station, and detectives Li Yaolong, Qian Yumin, and Zhang Ziying, Mao Jingen, etc., discovered that a private counterfeit money printing operation was set up at No. 78 Jianye Lane, Fuli Road. At 10:00 AM yesterday, they led detectives such as Qin Youyu and Zhou Buguang to rush to the scene, guarded the front and back doors, and broke into the house. They found counterfeit 10-yuan and 5-yuan models, various printing plates, and several disassembled motors and printing machines in the living room, packed in wooden boxes. They also arrested one person involved in the counterfeiting. They then went to the Datong Photographic Paper Plate Company at No. 122 North Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession and arrested another person related to the case. They were all taken to the police station for investigation, while detectives were sent to arrest the remaining accomplices.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shiying Family Lawsuit Judgment</h3>
<p>Regarding the Zhang Shiying family lawsuit, the court has made a judgment. The judgment is recorded as follows: Plaintiff, i.e., counterclaim defendant and incidental civil plaintiff, Zhang Yexiu, female, 39 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 13 Mingwa Lane, represented by lawyers Xu Bingcheng and Xu Fuji. Defendant, i.e., counterclaim plaintiff, Zhang Shiying, male, 55 years old, from Hefei, residing at No. 37 Zhangjiabang, salt merchant, represented by lawyer Zhang Shizhao. The defendant in the above case was sued by the plaintiff for breach of trust and embezzlement, with incidental civil claim. The defendant also filed a counterclaim. The court's judgment is as follows: (Ruling) Zhang Shiying is not guilty. Zhang Yexiu is not guilty. The incidental civil claim part is transferred to the civil court of this court for trial. (Reasons) According to this case, the defendant, i.e., the counterclaim plaintiff, Zhang Shiying, and the plaintiff's husband, i.e., the counterclaim defendant, Zhang Shikun, are brothers. Shikun has been ill for a long time. Since the separation in the eighth year of the Republic of China [1919], he has entrusted the defendant to manage his property. The income and expenditure over the years have been recorded in ledgers. However, the expenditures are too large, and there have been instances of pledging and selling property. The plaintiff therefore believes that there has been a breach of trust and embezzlement and filed a lawsuit. The defendant also filed a counterclaim for false accusation. After repeated summons, the defendant has submitted all the detailed ledgers of income and expenditure over the years for Langji (i.e., under Shikun's name) and Anji (i.e., the common house of each room), the list of sold fields and houses of Langji, the detailed ledger of each house's pond project, and the ledger of capital and profit and loss of Yihexing Salt Shop and the property deeds of the ninth room (i.e., under Shikun's name). After reviewing the accounts, they were all signed by Zhang Shikun or the plaintiff. It can be seen that there is no fraud. Although the plaintiff stated that one payment of 4,300 yuan in the 13th year and a pledge of 5,000 yuan in the 18th year were not received, the ledgers are all available for review. Moreover, an accountant has settled the accounts. It is clear that this case is purely a family dispute that has led to a misunderstanding. The defendant has not committed any breach of trust or embezzlement. The plaintiff cannot be said to have made a deliberate false accusation. As for the incidental civil claim part, there are still points to be investigated and should be transferred to the relevant court of this court for trial. Therefore, according to Articles 316 and 510 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the ruling. If you are not satisfied with the judgment, you may appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court within ten days from the day after the service of the judgment. December 18, 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], First Special District Court of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Criminal Court Judge Shen Bingrong, on the Huahai Wheel.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Child Trafficking Case Uncovered</h3>
<p>Liu Jinfu, a police officer of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, and detective Yang Chunting, were patrolling by patrol boat around 9:00 PM the day before yesterday. Near the Dada Pier, they saw the Huaan ship bound for Fujian, which was docked there and had not yet set sail. They boarded the ship to conduct an inspection. They found the following individuals in the cabins: Chen Wang, carrying a boy; Chen Lin, carrying a girl; Chen Gao, carrying a boy and a girl; Chen Ren, carrying a boy; Cai Chen, carrying a boy; Cao Bingnan, carrying a boy; Chen Deyuan and his wife Lin, carrying a boy. In total, there were two men, six women, six boys, and two girls. Their behavior was suspicious. They were all taken to the team. Xu, the captain, presided over the preliminary examination. Chen Wang stated that she was 22 years old, from Zhenjiang, and lived at No. 20 Yicheng Lane, South Wharf. Her husband's name is Chen Asan, and he is a soldier on a famous ship. The boy she was carrying is named Xizi, and he is seven years old. She bought him for 80 yuan and planned to take him to Fujian. Cao Bingnan stated that he was 31 years old, from Zhenjiang, and lived at No. 26 Haichao Temple Street, outside Xiaonanmen, South City. The boy he was carrying is named Zhu Xiaolong, and he is seven years old. Because his father's family is very poor and unable to raise him, he gave him to him. He plans to take him to Fujian. Chen Gao stated that she was 21 years old, from Fujian. The boy she was carrying is five years old, and the girl is just one year old. She bought the boy for 70 yuan and the girl for only 15 yuan. She plans to take them all to Fujian. Chen Deyuan stated that he was 38 years old, from Fujian. His wife, Lin, is 37 years old. The boy they were carrying is named Asheng, and he is two years old. His remaining words were vague. Chen Ren stated that she was 51 years old, from Fujian. The boy she was carrying is two years old, and she bought him for 21 yuan. Cai Chen stated that she was 51 years old, from Fujian. Her remaining words were vague. Chen Lin stated that she was 43 years old, from Fujian, and lived on Lafayette Road in the French Concession. The girl she was carrying is named Zhang Shuchun, and she is nine years old. She bought her from a neighbor for 120 yuan. Zhang Shuchun said that she was not trafficked by the woman, but by another man who sold her to the woman. At this time, the child's mother, Zhang Xu, heard the news and reported the case, stating that she was 50 years old, from Ningbo. Shuchun is her daughter, and she was trafficked by a former tenant, Su Tongyi, on the 20th of last month. As the case involves a large-scale trafficking of eight boys and girls and is of great importance, in addition to sending Chen Wang's boy Xizi, Chen Lin's girl Zhang Shuchun, Cao Bingnan's boy Zhu Xiaolong, and the plaintiff Zhang Xu to the Shanghai District Court, Chen Gao's boy and girl, Chen Deyuan and Lin's boy Asheng, Chen Ren's boy, and Cai Chen's boy were also sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhao Cuilin Sues Stepmother for Inheritance Division</h3>
<p>Court Adjourns to Attempt Reconciliation</p>
<p>Zhao Cuilin, a local woman, 23 years old, recently hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting to divide the inheritance with her stepmother, Zhao Lu. The lawsuit stated that the inheritance was being seized and requested a judgment for division. The plaintiff's father, Gui Sheng, had one son and two daughters during his lifetime. The eldest is the plaintiff, Cuilin, the second is the younger sister Linmei, and the third is the younger brother Jingen. After the plaintiff's mother, Shen, passed away, the father married Lu, the defendant, as his stepmother, who only had one daughter. When the father passed away from illness, the property left behind, estimated to be worth 100,000 yuan, was entirely controlled by the defendant. The plaintiff was not given any necessary expenses and was not shown any sympathy despite facing livelihood difficulties. This was intentional mistreatment. The plaintiff, as the eldest daughter, should have the right to inherit according to law. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit requesting that the defendant be ordered to appear in court and that the defendant be ordered to give the plaintiff one-quarter of the inheritance of the late father Gui Sheng, totaling 25,000 yuan, and bear the litigation costs. Furthermore, as the plaintiff is currently facing livelihood difficulties and all property is seized by the defendant, she is unable to pay the litigation costs. In addition to filing a separate guarantee letter to apply for litigation assistance, she also requests that the court approve it. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Mo opened the Ninth Civil Court for interrogation. The defendant hired lawyer Chen Bingxing to appear in court and defend. After the interrogation by Judge Li, it was determined that both parties had hope for reconciliation, so the hearing was adjourned and reconciliation will be attempted first.</p>
<p>Sixth District Police Station</p>
<h3>Breaking the Case of the Zhoujiaqiao Bandits</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 22nd (twenty-second) at approximately 8:40 PM, the Huangjinji Yellow Sand and Gravel Factory, located at No. 27 Gujia Lane, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, was suddenly stormed by a large group of bandits.  They robbed over a thousand silver dollars and dozens of pieces of silk and fur clothing. The responsible Sixth District Police Station, under District Chief Ren, quickly solved the case within four hours, directing officers and detectives. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Robbery Situation The Huangjinji Yellow Mud and Gravel Factory, located at No. 27 Gujia Lane, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, is owned by Huang Qibao from Teng County, Shandong Province. The business was doing reasonably well. The day before, it was the time to pay the workers' wages. Huang Qibao came to Shanghai in the afternoon and obtained over a thousand silver dollars in cash from a certain bank. He immediately sent someone to take it back to the factory. Huang stayed in Shanghai due to business and planned to return to the factory to pay the wages after 9 PM. Unexpectedly, just after 9:30 PM, eight or nine bandits suddenly burst in, holding pistols, intimidating everyone and forbidding them from making a sound. Two bandits stood guard outside, while the remaining bandits ransacked the place. They robbed 1,070 silver dollars in cash, over thirty pieces of silk, fur, wool, unlined, lined, and cotton cloth clothing, a suitcase, and a bicycle. After obtaining the loot, the bandits fled in all directions. Upon hearing the alarm, Patrol Officer Wei of the Second Sub-station of the Sixth District immediately led all the officers to pursue and arrest them, but the bandits had already gone far. He immediately reported to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Swift Case Solving Upon receiving the report, District Chief Ren of the Sixth District immediately directed Patrol Officer Xu, along with legal police chief Jin Zhang, police officers Liu Changdao, Yang Kunshan, Zhao Changxiu, Detective Team Leader Liu Shaoqing, detectives Gan Youjin, Tang Bingxiang, Cao Chuqiao, Wu Rui, and others, all fully armed, to Zhoujiaqiao to conduct a thorough search. At approximately 1 AM yesterday, Patrol Officer Xu, Patrol Officer Wei, and the legal police chief were patrolling along Avenue Petain when they suddenly saw three rickshaws speeding towards them. One of the people in the rickshaws was covering his face with his hat, looking panicked. They immediately ordered the rickshaws to stop. Unexpectedly, one of the men in the rickshaws drew a gun first, jumped out of the rickshaw in a panic, and fled. The police officers chased after him and apprehended him near Route Tenant de la Tour. They fired a pistol into the air. The bandit, panicking, ran into a small alley and was captured.  Along with two other bandits, they were arrested and taken back to the police station.  Confessing Accomplices  After District Chief Ren interrogated the three bandits, one confessed his name was Wu Jinshan, 26 years old, from Suqian, came from Suzhou, and had previously committed robbery. Another confessed his name was Guo Yongqing, 21 years old, from Suqian, lived at No. 1, Alley, South Yinghua Lane, and was a rickshaw puller. Another confessed his name was Chen Tongsheng, 43 years old, from Siyang, lived in Da Xu Lane, and was a rickshaw puller. All admitted to conspiring to rob the Huangjinji factory of cash and clothing and confessed that there were six accomplices, who were hiding in the first house in No. 1 Da Xu Lane, near Robison Road.  Continued Capture of Bandits  Yesterday at approximately 8 AM, Patrol Officer Wei led police officers in Zhoujiaqiao to capture a bandit involved in the case, Peng Shangzheng, and recovered nine pieces of stolen goods, including a woolen serge cheongsam. He was immediately escorted to the Sixth District Police Station. Also, at approximately 11 AM, Patrol Officer Xu, along with detectives and detectives dispatched by the Putuo Road Police Station, went to Da Xu Lane and arrested five bandits and one female bandit on the spot. They seized a pistol, several bullets, over thirty pieces of original stolen goods, including silk, fur, cotton, single-layer, and gauze clothing, a leather suitcase, and a bicycle.  They were immediately taken back together.  The factory owners, Huang Qibao and Huang Qiyun, identified all the stolen goods as correct.  After District Chief Ren interrogated the bandits, one confessed his name was Chen Yishun, 34 years old, from Xuzhou. Another confessed his name was Xia Yuansheng, 25 years old, from Suqian. Another confessed her name was Hou Guiying, 32 years old, from Xuzhou. Another confessed his name was Wei Qinggao, 36 years old, from Suqian. Another confessed his name was Hou Guiyou, 26 years old, from Xuzhou. The female, Hou Li, 37 years old, from Suqian, all admitted to the robbery. After obtaining the confessions, District Chief Ren prepared a document in the afternoon and sent it to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Child Killed by Car</h3>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 3:30 PM, car No. 3793, while driving on Avenue du President Foch, accidentally ran over a ten-year-old local child, Cheng Jinmei, who was walking on the road, killing her. The driver who caused the accident was sent to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Public Telephones to Be Increased in This City</h3>
<p>Merchants Can Request to Manage Them</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has already set up public telephones in the city, including the South Shanghai Main Bureau, the North Zhabei First and Second Sub-bureaus, the Jiangwan Sub-bureau, and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank’s Old West Gate and Small East Gate sub-branches, totaling six locations. The Municipal Public Utility Bureau believes that these telephones are a convenient tool for public transportation. Given the vast area of the city, the large population, and the high demand for telephones, the bureau believes that only six locations are insufficient to meet the needs. Therefore, it proposed recruiting merchants in suitable locations to manage the telephones on its behalf, offering generous rewards to facilitate promotion.  It drafted measures for merchants to manage public telephones and sent them to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau for consideration. It has now been learned that the measures have been submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval. Merchants in commercially important areas of the city can request the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to install public telephones and manage them.</p>
<h3>Li Yunsheng's Home Robbed</h3>
<p>The home of Li Yunsheng, located at No. 33 Suozi Lane, south of Dengyun Bridge, Zhaojiabang Road, Shanghai, was hosting a winter solstice banquet for relatives and friends the day before (the 22nd). At 7:30 PM, eight bandits suddenly arrived. Three bandits stood guard outside, and five bandits entered, four wearing grey overcoats and long gowns, and one wearing short clothes. All held pistols and claimed to be there to search for opium. They first ordered everyone to remain silent, then drove Li's entire family and the visiting relatives and friends, as well as Li's three tenants, into one room, which they locked and guarded. The bandits then went upstairs to the bedrooms, ransacked the place, and searched and robbed at will before leaving with their loot.  Afterwards, the stolen items were inventoried, including a total of 400 large and small new and old glass beads (for bead flowers) belonging to the Ye family, four gold rings inlaid with jewels, 80 silver dollars, a gold lock pendant with a chain and chicken heart pendant belonging to the Shen family, another ring, and 74 silver dollars. Li's home was reported to have not been robbed because the bandits thought they were taking too long and feared something might happen, so they did not search Li's bedroom. All the victims reported the robbery to the Second Sub-station of the Second District, requesting that the police investigate the stolen goods and bring the robbers to justice.</p>
<h3>Cheng Zanhua Escapes and Is Recaptured</h3>
<p>Cheng Zanping, a 26-year-old from Shandong, claimed to have studied at Shanghai West University, but did not graduate. He then became an investigator for the Stamp Tax Bureau but lost his job. He drifted into a group of thieves and gradually became bold. He even stole firearms from the Jinghu Railway North Station Police Department, hoping to get a good price. He was arrested by railway police and detained in a detention center. Cheng's hands were shackled, but he took advantage of the guards' negligence and, with the shackles still on, climbed the fence like a monkey and escaped. As a result, the guard, Zhuang Ziquan, was escorted by the police department to the local court for questioning. However, after Cheng escaped, he hid in the Xin Luming Hotel on the Fourth Road. The police department found out and, together with the patrol station, arrested Cheng. Yesterday, he was transferred to the local court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Worker Falls and Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Qin Binghua, an 18-year-old from Pudong, was working as a construction worker at the Huangpu Wharf of the Yangshupu Twisting Flower Bureau. Yesterday at approximately 12 PM, he was working on the roof of a building approximately 40 feet above the ground when he accidentally fell from a high place, injuring vital parts of his body and dying instantly. The fire department used a vehicle to transport him to Tongren Hospital and then to the coroner's office to await inspection by the court.</p>

Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant, Cen Ziliang, was absent and sent a lawyer to request a postponement. The plaintiff, Li Jinsheng, testified that he was a jeweler and explained the situation. He also stated that his wife had hired a Western doctor for treatment and that, due to mistakenly taking the prescription, she had entered the second stage of lung disease. If not treated promptly, it would be incurable by next year. His attorney stated that the defendant had committed the crime of negligent injury under Article 301, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code and submitted all the evidence and the reply from the Shenzhou National Medical Association.

<h3>Reactions to Rent Increase in Pucheng and C'ian Lanes</h3>
<p>The houses in Pucheng and C'ian Lanes on Route Lafayette in the French Concession are owned by Pua'itang and managed by the China Business Company. The rent was increased once in 1929. After repeated requests from the tenants, Father Jin verbally agreed to temporarily increase the rent by 4% and reconsider the situation after five years. However, Father Jin had just returned to his country this summer when the company issued a notice to all tenants this month, stating that the rent would be increased by 30% starting in January 1932. The tenants of both lanes believe that, in the face of the current national crisis and economic depression, it is difficult to bear the increased burden. They have organized a tenants' meeting and sent a letter to the company, requesting that the rent increase be cancelled.</p>

When the child went missing, he had a bald head, wore a floral Zhigong cotton robe, and a red-striped factory cloth long gown. He wore a white head rope around his neck and gray cloth cotton shoes with white edges. Mao Xiaofu is heartbroken due to his love for his son and is in great distress. He hopes that anyone who has taken in this child will quickly send him to the address so that the family can be reunited.</p>

<h3>Bethel Mission Report on the Northeast Incident</h3>
<p>The circumnavigating mission team organized by the Bethel Christian Church outside the West Gate of this city went to preach in various parts of the Northeast at the end of August. It happened to encounter the invasion of the Japanese invaders. The delegation preached in important locations in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang for three months. After careful investigation, it witnessed the impact on the churches, the oppression of the schools, and the innocent deaths of compatriots. The delegation personally witnessed the brutality and unreasonableness of the Japanese, the occupation of the territory, and the seizure of national rights.  It was filled with grief. Since returning to Shanghai, it has been reporting the true situation in the Northeast in various churches. Those who hear it are moved. The delegation deeply feels the lack of national spirit and the cowardice of the military. At this time of being watched by powerful neighbors, when the national spirit cannot be extended, it wants to invigorate itself, recover its territory, and resist foreign insults. The only way to do this is through moral transformation to eliminate corrupt officials and cowardly soldiers. All believers should not only pray for the country but also work hard to spread the message to save the country. In order to train missionaries, the delegation has decided to establish a short-term Bible course for one month starting on February 3 next year. All Christians who wish to attend are welcome. Inquiries about the details will be answered.</p>

<h3>Reader's Letter</h3>
<p>Mr. Peinong's Message (The Minimum Anti-Japanese Work)</p>
<p>Since the Japanese invaders invaded our eastern provinces, three months have passed. All of our citizens are furious and enraged. Everywhere is sufficient to show the true awakening of our people, no longer the five-minute fever of the past. Even if we take the boycott of Japanese goods as an example, the Japanese have reduced their exports by hundreds of millions of dollars to date, resulting in losses of no less than several million dollars. All of this is enough to frustrate the arrogance of the Japanese and save the country in the slightest. It is also a manifestation of our national spirit and the result of single-minded efforts. However, foreign disasters have not diminished as a result. There are still many things that our people should strive for. We all know that since the Opium War, for decades, under the balance of power of foreigners, all kinds of political and economic aggression have been used to the extreme. The September 18th Incident was even worse. We are under the watchful eyes of tigers. The wounds are deep, the pain is extreme, and the disease has penetrated the bone marrow and cannot be cured. This is the wish of the imperialists and the critical moment for our country's survival. However, as long as the spirit of China is not dead for a day and the lifeline of the country is still there for a day, all of our compatriots should take the most effective methods to confront them and continue to work hard to achieve it for the sake of the country and the nation. What is the most effective method? It is the aggression of foreigners and the economic aggression. Even its political aggression is economic aggression. The most effective method is naturally to制之control it with economy. All of the following are the most economical means that our compatriots should adopt, and they are also the efforts that can achieve the greatest results with the slightest effort: (1) Absolute boycott of Japanese goods. Although this is already underway, since Japan recently implemented a gold re-ban, its purpose is nothing more than to develop trade in China. The Japanese have seen through our country's boycott as a temporary fever, and most people are greedy for profit. Therefore, in order to avoid being tricked, we should make a thorough boycott of Japanese goods and embrace the spirit of "Don't want it even if it's cheaper," regardless of whether it's a necessity or a luxury. (2) Don't buy foreign goods other than indispensable commodities. On the one hand, prevent the outflow of 利權 rights, and on the other hand, promote domestic goods. Foreign goods are more expensive, and in general, fashionable people are all "Westernized" in their minds, so domestic goods are in danger. This point should include two things: (A) Don't buy luxury goods. (B) Don't buy foreign goods if there are domestic goods that can replace them. (3) Strive to promote domestic goods and實業 industry. (A) Government encouragement and protection. (B) Media promotion. (C) Investment efforts. (D) Awakening of the people. This point is the most important. To this day, the reason why domestic goods have declined is that domestic merchants cannot compete with foreigners. The biggest reasons are as follows: (甲) the constraints of unequal treaties; (乙) the lack of capital. Both of these reasons are sufficient to affect the cost of production, and 間拉 between enough to affect the price of production. As a result, for the same goods, if our country's merchants make it, the cost will be expensive, and if foreign merchants make it, the cost will be cheap. However, patriotic merchants will not regret it. All success or failure depends on us. If our compatriots can have true awareness and can be considerate of domestic goods, then even if foreign goods are 精 refined and cheap, and domestic goods are 拙 clumsy and expensive,寧捨 rather give up foreign goods and choose domestic goods, then imperialists will fall without being attacked. Then China's domestic goods are almost achieved. (4) Cultivate the habit of frugality. People in the cities mostly admire the European style, but in fact, it is all superficial. The so-called "modern" clothing must be Western-style suits, food must be Western food, living must be 洋房 Western-style houses, and transportation must be automobiles. They waste money to gain vanity and waste time and abandon practicality. We all know that Gandhi in a Western suit is despised, while Gandhi in coarse cloth is respected. People don't have to be judged by their clothes, and people don't have to be 洋 Westernized in their腔 accent to be 摩登 modern. Moreover, these kinds of enjoyment are mostly畸形 deformed and not in line with China's national conditions. If we think of the victims of disaster in the sixteen provinces who are waiting to be fed and仰天 howling in the cold, they are also people, and we are also people. The difference in experience is self-evident. If we can truly save the world and truly love people, save a few coins, cultivate the habit of frugality, and invest in民 industry, then people's welfare will depend on it, and the revitalization of domestic goods will have a day. If it is so, it is better than building a seven-story pagoda. (5) Eliminate the custom of sending festival gifts and New Year's greetings. Regarding this level, when we think about the motivation, it is nothing more than using this on the one hand to "connect emotions" and on the other hand to use this as a "happy thing." However, in this time of national crisis, when there is no time for sorrow, how can there be happiness? As for connecting emotions, then the emotions that need to be connected by gifts are also not good and not wonderful. Moreover, in reality, those who send gifts are often not economically裕餘 surplus. In severe cases, they even borrow money to send gifts to make friends with people. From the perspective of the giver, the situation is indeed unbearable. Even from the perspective of the receiver, the favor is also difficult to bear. Moreover, the gifts sent by the giver are mostly foreign goods or useless items. This is tantamount to creating sales channels for foreigners, and the useful money is used for unnecessary items. It is most effective to send each other gifts and reduce the utility of money. What is even worse is that general male and female students use their parents' hard-earned money to exchange worthless gifts to create emotions and gain vanity. This is the behavior of gold-worshippers and should not be taken. Not only that, young students are the most promising for the country. Customs like this, which are harmful to the family and the country, should be eliminated. Chinese people, why don't we all do it together? Don't use unconscious actions at one time to follow this and trap the country in decline.</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Having recently read in your esteemed newspaper the Nanjing dispatch stating that Shao Gu went to Taiyuan on the 22nd to urge Feng to come to Beijing to participate in the plenary session, Gu yesterday came to Shanghai due to illness to seek medical treatment at the Hua Xia Fei Sanatorium.

<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Having read the news item published in the local news column of your esteemed newspaper on December 23rd ("The branch offices of various districts in this city held a joint meeting yesterday"), the inclusion of our branch office as attending the meeting is quite perplexing. Upon investigation, our branch office has not held a meeting or sent representatives to participate in any organization since the 25th Party Member Congress on the 11th of this month. This record is likely incorrect. In addition to reporting our denial, we hope you will correct this matter. This is of utmost importance. Please accept the respects of the Shanghai Special Municipality Sixth District Twenty-fourth Branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party. December 23rd.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Having read today's local news column in your esteemed newspaper regarding the joint meeting of various district branch offices, it mentioned that our branch office attended.

<p>Having recently read in your esteemed newspaper a news item about the joint meeting of the branch offices of various districts in this city, which listed the Sixth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth branches of the Sixth District as participating, we are extremely astonished. Upon investigation, our branch offices have always adhered to Party discipline and have never participated in any recent organizations or meetings. Fearing this may cause confusion, in addition to publishing a statement, we are sending this special letter, hoping for a correction. Respectfully addressed to the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao newspaper. The Sixth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth branches of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Nationalist Party, together. Addressed to the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao newspaper.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Having read yesterday's news in your esteemed newspaper about the United Office of the branch offices of the Fourth District Party Headquarters, our branch offices were also falsely listed as being included. Upon reading this, we were extremely shocked. Our branch offices absolutely deny any involvement in the organization of this office or the so-called exercise of the powers of the District Party Headquarters. Regarding the direction of Party affairs in this city, we will naturally await the central government's resolution. We hereby send this letter as a solemn declaration. With best wishes, the Sixth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth branches of the Fourth District of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Nationalist Party, together. 20, 12, 24.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Having investigated the news published in yesterday's esteemed newspaper regarding the establishment of the (United Office of District Branch Offices) at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association, our branch offices were also falsely listed as being included. Upon reading this, we were extremely surprised and shocked. Our branch offices did not participate in this meeting on that day. We are sending this letter to declare our denial and hope it will be published in your esteemed newspaper for correction. Respectfully addressed to the editor of the Shen Bao newspaper, the Sixtieth branch of the Fourth District of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Nationalist Party, together. 20, 12, 24.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Having read the news item (Joint Meeting of Various District Branch Offices) in yesterday's esteemed newspaper, which listed representatives from our branch office as attending, we are very surprised. At this time, our branch office has neither joined with any parties nor sent representatives to participate in any organization. We absolutely deny the report's content and hope for a correction to clarify the truth. Addressed to the Shen Bao newspaper, the Thirtieth branch of the First District of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Nationalist Party. December 21st.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Having read in your esteemed newspaper about worker Tan Honglin and others from the Huashang Electrical Workers Union leading over a hundred workers to forcibly take over the union, we are deeply shocked. Upon investigation, Tan Honglin, He Zhaokui, Hu Yida, Cai Heshang, Li Jin, Zhao Sanyuan, and other six people were publicly elected as executive directors by the general assembly of all self-governing members. They should go to take over. The statement that Tan Honglin led over a hundred workers to forcibly take over is clearly someone turning black and white upside down. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to correct the record and avoid misleading the public. We hope for correction. Addressed to the Shen Bao newspaper, the Shanghai First District Water and Electricity Industry Workers Union. December 23rd.</p>

<h3>Private Tutor</h3>
<p>— Ding Nu</p>
<p>(One)</p>
<p>It could be considered his fortune that he completed his university education at a time when the world economy was in a state of panic. However, the scent of the petty bourgeoisie became an obstacle to his attainment of so-called academic achievement. And the strict and insurmountable walls of society just so happened to limit his path after leaving school. In this hodgepodge situation, he became a bored private tutor.</p>
<p>Although drinking too much alcohol is certainly uncomfortable, not drinking enough is not comfortable either. Therefore, since he took up the teaching post, he has not felt any less bored than when he was idle. When he has nothing to do, he always wants to find something to do, just as when the sky is overcast, one always hopes for the sunlight to come out to freshen the air. But when the sunlight really shines through, it is not necessarily pleasant. At that time, your discomfort may be because the light is too strong or too weak. The world never fully achieves an ideal state in one fell swoop. In history, there have been many figures we admire who lived very difficult lives before they became prominent. When he reached the extreme of depression, he had to use these theories as temporary comfort. Apart from the present, he is also at a loss when it comes to the future.</p>
<p>When he was at school, he had plans for how to arrange his life after leaving school. But when he actually went out into society, he became flustered and helpless. From the experience of reality, he knew that those plans were just a fantasy. In the scientific world of the twentieth century, people who harbor fantasies simply cannot exist. It is appropriate to be disillusioned by reality. He basically recognized his fate, put down the golden ax of hope, and surrendered to this society. It is pitiful that he is like a statue waiting to be bound by the dragon, a godless believer with no autonomy.</p>
<p>In front of society, he displayed his incompetence, but in front of his old acquaintances, he did not have the courage to surrender to society and expose his weaknesses. These two different forces fought in his mind. At first, he was at a loss as to the origin of this war. When he went deeper, he realized that this was due to the reflection of the transitional period between the old and new eras on the one hand, and the petty bourgeoisie's sense of honor pulling the strings on the other. He often thought that if he was a middle school student, it would not matter. But for a dignified college student to do this unpromising thing would be a great loss of face. Otherwise, if he came from a poor family, it would not matter either. Getting thirty dollars a month would not be considered bad luck. But with the status of a petty bourgeoisie, if he was a student, this thirty dollars would only be enough for one splurge, which would be extremely unlucky. Therefore, in front of friends, he was always afraid to say what he was doing. Sometimes, when friends pressed him so hard that he had to answer, he had to say, "I have nothing to do." He thought that it was better to say that he had nothing to do than to say that he was a private tutor. Saying that he had nothing to do was enough to show that his talent had not yet been priced. Saying that he was a private tutor was clearly declaring that the price he had been marked at was too low. (Two)</p>
<p>Watching the wheels of time roll backward while doing something unpromising, he felt sad.</p>
<p>With a shadow of sadness, he walked past the department store. He saw the Christmas gifts displayed beautifully in the glass cabinet, one by one. He sized them up for a long time, hesitating to leave. He was extremely frustrated, thinking that he had no power to buy these gifts to give to some close friends. Last Christmas, he spent more than twenty dollars on things to give to a female friend named Yu and several male classmates. Among these male classmates, the one named Wu received the most. Now, this classmate named Wu has returned to his home in Hong Kong. He has a Western-style house to live in and beautiful lovers to embrace. His life is naturally much more comfortable than his own, but fate is the same. He heard that he was recently ordered by his father to go to a bank to intern. He wrote in a letter that he was not used to it at all. Although it was called going to intern, in fact he only watched people busy coming and going, while he shook his legs and smoked. When the hour came, he put on his hat and left, mixed in the ranks of busy people. The airs were full, but the empty shell of life was hard to bear.</p>
<p>From his classmate Wu, he then thought of his female friend named Yu. He remembered when they lived on North Sichuan Road last winter, this female friend often came to play, and how fun it was. He loved her very much, loved her charming eyes, how . One night, everyone drank some alcohol, and in a drunken state, she opened her delicate throat and sang a song of Wujiapo. This song penetrated his heart and made him so infatuated that he could not wait to step forward and kiss her passionately. The warm memories made him admire this female friend even more. However, the falling flowers have feelings, but the flowing water is merciless. This female friend has been snatched away by a relative of hers, which is not at all frustrating.</p>
<p>Back in his room, his mind was full of cluttered thoughts. One moment it was as if he was in the crowded intersection of a street, the next moment it was as if he was on top of a snowy and icy mountain.</p>
<p>Christmas is coming soon, and he is anxious about it. He hopes to raise a small sum of money as he wishes, so that he can go to the dance hall on Christmas Eve and have a good dance. But looking at the situation, it seems that he will be disappointed. He wants to write a few articles to exchange for some money, but he can't write them. At the same time, the family money that he had been hoping for has not yet arrived, making people wonder if it has been sent, and even if it has been sent, whether it will be in time for use. Such worries oppress him like an ant on a hot pot.</p>
<p>It was not until a friend saw his mood and promised to help him raise this small sum of money that he felt at ease. (Three)</p>
<p>These days, the weather has turned cold, and the north wind is blowing hard again. He can't go outside to walk around, so he has to hide in his attic. But after all, the weather is too cold. Even with talking and laughing, he doesn't feel comfortable. From this time on, he had the idea of installing a stove in his room to spend the winter comfortably. Because of this problem, he frowned again. Although installing a stove does not require much money, it is absolutely impossible under his financial situation. He can only get a salary of thirty yuan a month. Apart from paying rent and food, the rest is limited. There is no surplus to be used for other purposes, so he began to become annoyed again. This evening, he returned from tutoring at the mansion at ten o'clock. It was raining outside.</p>
<p>The raindrops on his sparse black hair trembled in the dim light, and his face looked even paler. He took off his wet clothes and slumped into a chair, starting to gasp for breath.</p>
<p>His lifeless eyes looked around the room for a week, then fell on the picture of a celebrity hanging on the opposite wall. This celebrity is smiling at him. He recognizes that this smile is not well-intentioned, as if saying, the national crisis is coming, and you are still indulging in warm memories and seeking a comfortable personal life, damn it.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Reviews</p>
<h3>Rice, Cotton, Yarn (Continued) Qin Jiannan</h3>
<p>Commodity Series, Volumes 1, 2, and 3</p>
<p>Edited by the Shanghai Bank Investigation Department</p>
<p>Three, Yarn</p>
<p>The section on (Yarn) is the most extensive, with over two hundred pages, and the discussion is also the most detailed. Its structure is similar to the previous two sections, divided into the following sections: (1) Types of Shanghai Cotton Yarn, explaining the meaning of count, types of count, and classification of trademarks; (2) Estimation of Supply and Demand of Shanghai Cotton Yarn, with an annual supply of over 1.2 million bales, of which ten are shipped overseas, 700,000 are shipped to various ports in China, and over 400,000 are used by large and small weaving factories in the city; (3) Transportation and Sale of Shanghai Cotton Yarn, describing the nature of various merchant groups and customs declarations, transportation costs, and the nature of sales, and attaching the position of Shanghai cotton yarn in China's cotton yarn trade; (4) Transactions of Shanghai Cotton Yarn, divided into yarn shops, cotton yarn brokers, foreign firms, exchanges, and brokers; (5) Shanghai Yarn Factories, describing their history, organization, machinery, and operations; (6) Finance of Shanghai Yarn Industry, listing all methods of fundraising in the yarn industry; (7) Value of Shanghai Cotton Yarn, collecting statistics from over ten years, analyzing in detail to obtain long-term trends and reasons for various changes; (8) Shanghai Yarn Industry Groups; (9) Directions for Improvement of Shanghai Yarn Industry, discussing points for improvement for merchant groups, yarn shops, and yarn factories.</p>
<p>There are many excellent points in the book, and I will mention a few for introduction.</p>
<p>(1) Special attention is paid to the sales of various brands of cotton yarn. Which brand is sold to which merchant group is recorded in detail based on field investigations, which is not without reference value for those engaged in the yarn business. (2) Special attention is paid to the operation of Japanese yarn. Before the boycott, the power of Japanese yarn in Shanghai was greater than that of Chinese yarn. This section pays special attention to the operation of Japanese yarn. In the supply and demand of Shanghai cotton yarn, it is explained that (in terms of quantity, the supply of Shanghai factory yarn is not as good as that of Japanese merchants, but in terms of value, Chinese merchants are far inferior to Japanese merchants,) because Japanese merchants spin fine yarn, while Chinese merchants spin coarse yarn, and the value of the same bale of yarn is very different. In the transportation and sale of Shanghai cotton yarn, it is also explained that the transportation and sale of Chinese cotton yarn is far less common than that of Japanese cotton yarn. In the Shanghai Yarn Factory section, the rise and fall of Chinese and Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai is described, and it is concluded that Chinese factories cannot take advantage of opportunities. In the finance of Shanghai yarn industry, the finance of Chinese and Japanese yarn factories is compared to clarify their strengths and weaknesses. If we want to boycott Japanese goods, we must first understand the reasons for the victory of Japanese goods. This book emphasizes this point in particular and can be used as a reference book for boycotting Japanese yarn. (3) Special attention is also paid to merchant groups who handle yarn. Usually, when talking about the yarn industry, only yarn factories are focused on, and little attention is paid to merchant groups. However, merchant groups control the needs of cotton yarn, and their power should not be underestimated. This book describes the nature, financial transactions, etc. of various merchant groups in detail, and discusses methods for their improvement, which is also rare material.</p>
<p>(4) A very precise exploration of yarn prices. The book plots the yarn prices for the past ten years into a curve, making it clear at a glance, and finds its silver amount to be over 157 taels, and its degree of change to be about ten taels. Therefore, the profits or losses of cotton yarn speculation are deduced, and then the molecules of cotton yarn prices are deduced, and examples are used to prove that all problems with yarn prices are discussed.</p>
<p>The appendix to this section includes a list of yarn factories across the country, a list of Shanghai yarn shops, a list of Shanghai yarn brokers, and a list of Shanghai yarn merchant groups. The material in the entire section is more extensive than the above two sections, and all statistics are quite accurate. Anyone who is concerned about the cotton yarn issue should refer to it. (The three books are sold at the Shanghai Bank Trust Department and the Liming Bookstore on Fourth Malu.)</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Japan's National Power Sword Ying</h3>
<p>In the more than fifty years since the Meiji Restoration, Japan's national power has leaped to the ranks of the world's powers. Now, it is actually implementing its policy of invading the mainland. In this serious and rapid era of change, the current situation of Japan's national power is what our people urgently need to know.</p>
<p>The current situation of Japan's national power can give us a glimpse of the degree of progress of this enemy and how strong its national life is, as a reference for us. From this, we can know both ourselves and the enemy to decide the direction and plan to deal with the enemy.</p>
<p>The book is divided into nine sections and is extremely concise. The following is a brief introduction.</p>
<p>(1) Area and Population. The total area of Japan's land is more than 44,000 square miles, accounting for one-195th of the world's land. Its recent population is over 91.79 million, and the density is also higher than other countries. The population's occupations are divided into agriculture, fishery, mining, industry, and commerce. On average, 45,000 Japanese from the mainland should be relocated to the colonies every year.</p>
<p>(2) Status of Production and Material Needs. This section describes Japan's important industries, such as agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, fishery, mining, and industry, and describes the status of each industry, as well as statistics comparing the import and export of goods needed for clothing, food, and housing.</p>
<p>(3) Commerce, Trade, Prices, and Finance. This section describes the general situation of domestic commercial institutions such as exchanges, business companies, warehouses, and various commercial companies. Next, it describes statistics comparing the amount of foreign trade imports and exports. There are also brief descriptions of the balance of payments outside of trade, prices, and financial conditions.</p>
<p>(4) Transportation, Transportation, and Communication. This section describes land transportation (railways, roads, etc.), water transportation (such as shipping, ports, etc.), aviation, and communication institutions, with brief descriptions and statistical comparison tables.</p>

<p>(5) National Defense Facilities, Judiciary, and Police. This section describes (1) the current situation of national defense, and includes a table of the current situation of the Japanese army, navy, and air force in Showa 7 (2) describes the situation of the judiciary and police.</p>
<p>(6) Social Facilities. This section describes the establishment of social undertakings, regulations, and institutions, the country's equipment for health care, medicine, and medical affairs, and social sports and general entertainment, etc.</p>
<p>(7) Education, Religion, Academics, Publishing, Literature, Art, and Entertainment. This section briefly describes the characteristics of Japanese education and its spirit and the state of compulsory education, religious beliefs, the progress of academic research, the development of the publishing industry, the imitation and originality of literature and art, and the types of entertainment, which are extremely clear and concise.</p>
<p>(8) Current Situation of Finance. This section describes the national treasury's budget, national debt, local finance, national wealth, and national income, etc., and each item has a brief and concise table.</p>
<p>(9) Conclusion.</p>
<p>The description in this book gives us a most general and simple outline of the current situation of Japan's national power. The conclusion of this book also indicates that the book contains two most obvious meanings. Now I may as well quote them as the end of this introduction. (1) What kind of country is Japan, and what are all its domestic phenomena? This book has given a miniature answer of Japan to these two questions, which can be said to have made a general contribution to those who do not understand Japan. (2) This article can also be said to be a reference with the effect of a catalog for those who aspire to Japanese studies.</p>
<h3>Collection of Northeast Immigration Issues</h3>
<p>In today's era of turbulent winds and treacherous waves in the Pacific Ocean, the Northeast has simply become the Balkans of the East, and its situation is as serious as that of the Balkans before the war.</p>
<p>The Northeast has a large area and abundant resources, and it is a remote border area, especially under the covetous invasion of Japanese imperialism. The current situation is very dangerous. This is not only a matter of survival in one corner of the Northeast, but the key to the survival of the entire Chinese nation. However, because our country is weak, we cannot use force to resist strong neighbors. Therefore, the best way is to actively colonize the Northeast. This book is for this urgent problem, this great mission to fight for national survival, describing the great significance and practical issues of immigrating to the Northeast, etc. The whole book is divided into five chapters. Now I will briefly introduce it as follows.</p>
<p>(1) The Northeast urgently needs to be developed. This chapter explains that to develop the Northeast, increasing the population is an important issue. The Northeast is a most beautiful and fertile zone recognized by countries around the world today. It is the most suitable agricultural area in the Far East, and its resources are endless.</p>
<p>(2) The great significance of Northeast immigration is divided into two points. From a political point of view, immigration to the border area and self-development can block the path of foreign immigration and preserve the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty. From an economic point of view, we can only actively invest in rural areas in the Northeast and actively support immigrants to the Northeast.</p>
<p>(3) Investigation of the history of Northeast immigration. This chapter describes the immigration to the Northeast before and during the Qing Dynasty, from the initial form to the land reclamation policy, and the complete abolition of the Manchurian blockade policy.</p>
<p>(4) Modern Northeast Immigration. This section describes the reasons for Northeast immigration in recent years, and analyzes in detail that it is due to overpopulation, natural disasters, wars, bandit disasters, heavy donations, etc. In addition, it also describes the situation of immigration and the state of distribution of immigrants.</p>
<p>(5) Practical Issues of Northeast Immigration. The issues discussed in this chapter all belong to the scope of agriculture. First, the issue of immigrants' financial resources is discussed. Immigrants must have a certain responsible organization to plan and carry out the work, and should raise huge sums of money to subsidize them in order to have practical results. Second, the value of land in recent years has varied greatly due to differences in geology, location, transportation, supply and demand, time, raw or cooked, year, and security conditions. Third, the conditions for renting land by immigrants are described. Fourth, the value of livestock and farm implements in recent years is described. Fifth, the types of hired farmers and the conditions for hired farmers are described. Sixth, the consumption of clothing, food, and housing for immigrants, etc., is described.</p>
<p>The book tells us about the general situation of the Northeast and that immigration is the key to saving the country today. We deeply regret that for decades, we have allowed imperialists and powers to dominate and seize without knowing how to use it or develop it. What a miscalculation this is.</p>
