<h3>銀問題</h3>
<p>據南京電謂美參議院關於生銀問題主提案三項由林百克自美寄華原文甚長現在翻譯一爲印度傾銷問題二爲召集國際銀價會議三爲對華借欵問題但據今日華盛頓電前參議院通過畢特門提議中之召集國際會議胡佛總統迄未正式表明其態度胡佛氏之顧問有謂美總統對於召集會議之建議國將擱置不論又有謂此種會議即使召集其議程亦將加以限制不使有關係各國有所爲難云再由各方面言咸謂印度若不停止售銀則銀價永難恢復原狀胡總統因之遲遲不進以免英美兩國之感情爲此而受其影響是美國對於第二項之召集國際會議問題己難實現至於對於第三項之借銀於中國問題旣因各國有牽連之勢又因中國政府未有表示而美國單獨借欵亦無實行之决心故第三項之建議亦惟有此建議而己總之美參議院通過之畢特門建議今己可謂無形消滅也</p>

<h3>講演國民黨的使命</h3>
<p>瀋陽通信中央特派視察東北黨務之吴鐵城氏本月八日應遼寗國民常識促進會之請在該會講演「國民黨的使命」茲紀演詞如下</p>
<p>主席諸位同志今天是東北國民常識促進會開春季大會各縣工作人員報告寒假中的工作情形剛才聽見主席説諸君利用寒假回到各人的家鄉去爲社會服務這是一種很有意義的工作就普通一般的學生情形來講平日在學校朝夕研究學問正可趁着假期休息休息或者家中戚友歡聚誰還願意我那種純倅義務的工作來做呢而諸君却能舍棄各人休息的權利不顧天寒地凍回到各人的家鄉爲社會服務這種犧牲的精神眞值得使人敬佩希望君永遠保持這種白立人的精神不但各人的學問事業可卜成功就是中國社會的改造也蒙受莫大的影響了</p>
<p>主席要兄弟在諸君報告工作之先來説幾句話這是兄弟十分榮幸而願意的因爲兄弟遠隔數千里很難得一個機會與諸位熱心爲社會服務的東北青年聚首一堂兄弟是中國國民黨的黨員而此次又是爲視察東北黨務來的當然還是説關於黨的話關外有句俗話這個敎門兒因爲我是這個敎門兒所以請諸位不要笑我説三句不離本行</p>
<p>本黨總理孫中山先生是創造中華民國的領袖他爲了要創造一個自由平等的中華民國便發明了三民主義爲了要實行救國建國的三民主義便又創造一個首先實行主義的中國國民黨今天兄弟所要講的就是「中國國民黨的使命」簡單一句話説中國國民黨之使命是在遵奉</p>
<p>總理遣敎實行三民主義而三民主義的原理是集世界革命理論之大成牠的目的基於中華民族之自由平等民權之伸張民生之满足而達到世界大同這是多麽偉大的一種使命多麽煩難的一種工作</p>
<p>民族之不平等是由於帝國主義者作崇帝國主義發蹤於五百年前到十九世紀始大告成功全民政治的運動發生才不過一百年從前世界各國的政治都是受神權君權的支配現在還留着殘餘的痕跡至於民生之凋　是由於個人資本主義的發達少數人得到經濟優越的地位大多數勞苦民衆過著惡劣的生活這不僅經濟落後的中國如此即産業　漲的歐美各國目前亦成爲嚴重的問題我們想把以上三個問題一氣解决這實在不是一件容易的事然而我們决不畏難苟安有了總理的三民主義我們相信我們的努力是可以達到目的的而且是爲期不遠的中國國民黨奮鬥了三十餘年排除一切障碍掃蕩一切反動勢力才能得到今日國家的統一與和平這雖是先烈的頸與同志的熱血所換得來的代價而東北當局與民衆的同情接受本黨主義參加國民命亦是歷史上不可磨滅的功績然就中國目前的情形來看外有帝國主義者仍在耽耽虎視并不曾放棄其侵略的政策内則各種反動份子蠢蠢思動希圖破壞國家的統一與和平爲要完成我們的責任（救國建國的責任）只有圑結全國革命的民衆在中國國民黨領導之下繼續努力所以兄弟今日特提出這個題目中國國民黨的使命來講</p>
<p>本黨初起革命的時候東北便不少的同志參加而十七年統一之完成尤賴於張副司令與各長官及東北民衆之贊助在理黨部早就成立了何以遷延至今還在籌備呢初則因爲蘇俄侵略邊境跟着　馮聯合叛亂所以遲遲至今現在國境的秩序己恢復了閻馮也打倒了在東北官民一致熱烈擁護黨治情緒之下黨部的成立便刻不容緩兄弟又能得着這個機會在黨部公開工作以前而來同各位講講黨的使命雖則是應景然亦覺得是應該而必要的</p>
<p>中國國民黨旣負起了救國建國的使命其性質顯然與普通政黨不同普通的政黨多半是以階級爲分野的他們是站在利害相同的鴻溝上爲實現其同一階級的利益而聯合他們的政治主張自然是片面的如日本的民政黨政友會無産政黨德之保守黨社會民主黨英之工黨及保守黨等中國國民黨是爲四萬萬人謀解放求自由的革命黨因爲中華整個民族是在帝國主義壓迫侵略之下經濟上只有大貧小貧原無階級之分職業上只有士農工商亦無貴賤之别他的革命運動是聯合各種職業的覺悟份子去領導各種職業的民衆在同一主義之下向敵人進攻換句話説中國國民黨不是代表某一階級的黨而是爲四萬萬人謀福利的黨我們環顧中國的現像與乎世界的潮流只有中國國民黨能担負這個救國建國的責任同時全國人民也應積極擁護本黨完成救國建國以謀中華民族全國體福利之義務（未完）</p>

<h3>述遇合之奇</h3>
<p>— 王梅璩</p>
<p>余以二十年二月十二日由滬赴杭視我長女藴文重三後一日返滬此二十日中骨肉圑聚親朋宴集事雖甚樂都無可紀惟所見所聞頗有遇合出於不倫不類者敢述其奇以告同文蓋亦感慨係之焉</p>
<p>▲豆油腐之與魚翅　長壻許子茹香被長官檄委查仙居黄巖兩縣控案風雪嚴寒崎嶇水陸往返將匝所述兩邑水士風俗起居飲食皆駭聽聞以不在本題範圍以内姑從略惟仙居土著之宴客其窮極奢侈者亦用魚翅茹香爲密查委員不動聲色佯爲過客飲城中某氏主人亦知敬客魚翅登筵起身把盞如常例茹香下箸見羹如骨董魚翅僅如鳳毛麟角而油豆腐細切成絲時與魚翅並夾入箸魚翅本奢侈食品少用之或不用皆可但自有魚翅以來從未聞與油豆腐爲偶而竟有之貴賤階級亦不足恃此遇合之奇一也</p>
<p>▲堅氷之與炭　客冬之寒爲三十年來所未有余到杭州日坐一室長女以圍爐汾酒爲老人禦寒窗前排列水缸多具接儲天泉二月二十四日偶見青天白日負喧檐下見缸中堅氷未泮中有一物黑而長命外孫輩鑿之得栗炭一段亦不知何時何人以炭投水而與氷合氷炭之不入乃亦有時而相容此遇合之奇二也</p>
<p>▲補服之與醫部　姻家沈蔚文兄僑居杭城后市街二月二十五日往訪之因留午飲所居之樓高而安深而明金石圖書燦然羅列而所坐交椅皆以前清四五品金繡補服寶以棉絮用爲坐褥二十年前在清末造名器雖濫然此金繡輝煌之補服亦惟與前後心相周旋耳即專制帝王之臀部亦不辱此補服而壓其下今乃别開生面臀部竟有補服此遇合之奇三也</p>
<h3>影事消長錄</h3>
<p>— 秀琳</p>
<p>花蘭塢今日的影業的繁榮己經達於極點有人説美國的電影營業比　包營業還要普徧這也可見其勢力之偉大了但是讓我們來追想到初有電影的時代吧當一八八九年安迪生發明電影機以後還經過了不少的困苦艱難也耗費了不少的心智財力而所得到的成績僅僅是短短的幾百頁以至幾千頁的連續的動作而己藝術當然是説不上連娱樂尙且談不到哩直到後來有許多短篇的滑稽片出現才開展了電影事業的光榮之幕諸位當然還記得有位泡洛先生他的滑稽的表演當時是電影界裏最有力量的一個</p>
<p>短的滑稽片畢竟是失掉它的中心地位了比較有意思有情節的影片也漸漸有得發見了但我們還記得中間的一個時代是維繫在許多長篇的偵探機關影片上的當時寶連女士的芳名遠在梅麗璧克馥之上而連台幾十本的偵探强盜片的確飽受了熱烈的歡迎雖然這許多人和事在今日己成爲一種老話然而還有幾顆很明亮的星照耀在今日的花蘭塢尤其是露拉勒潑萊脱女士和亞杜夫門郁先生我相信如其有人跟伊們談起十五年以前的事怕會使伊們感慨系之吧</p>
<p>此後那些言情影片便代替了偵探長片而造就了電影事業的上進時期的開端離開現在是還不很久啊當時的許多演員至今還大部分依然閃耀在銀幕之上祇有一位南徐穆兒姑娘也許己經快要給我們遺忘</p>
<p>最近的八九年内電影事業的進步委實可驚到現在電影己經成爲包羅萬象的一件大事業了而且有聲電影又發明了那些科學家又更進一小而在苦心孤詣地試騐着立體電影了預料在十年以後這電影的潮流必高漲在政治的潮流之上</p>
<p>在中國我們在這短短的電影歷史上來觀察顯見得我國的電影事業的進展比了先進的美國要神奇得多我國的人才經濟時間設備都不及美國遠甚而我國的成績若以年代作比例則遠勝於美國多多這不是自己誇口事實是擺在面前以前我國的影片即使是因陋就簡到十二分但是只要看看最初的美國影片如何是不是還要陋還要簡</p>
<p>古裝潮過去了打武潮過去了神怪潮過去了它的過程也同美國差不多現在居然迎頭趕上去有聲影片也在我國的電影界顯出了神奇的成功這豈不是可喜的現象最近一張「歌女紅牡丹」片閧動了上海不但中國影片發現了新的生命而且外國影片的原有的壁壘也給它摇動起來我們試從「紅牡丹」的主角胡蠂女士和夏佩珍女士的最早的地位一直想到伊們現在的成功就彷彿可以聯想起美國影片的神速的進展來好再等五年罷我不相信中國影片是不能勝過外國影片的</p>

<p>孫科談</p>
<h3>兩路增價苦衷</h3>
<p>收支相抵不敷過巨孫擬最近返粤省親鐵道部長孫科昨晨七時由京乘夜快車抵滬昨日下午三時市長張羣特往孫氏寓所拜會報告滬市進行國民會議代表選舉情形至四時許始行興辭本報記者昨訪晤孫氏據談民會事務正積極籌辦余己有兩載未返廣東中山原籍頗思最近抽暇一行以二週爲期便道訪晤唐紹儀氏視察中山縣建設情形但日期殊未能决定耳</p>
<h3>中山築港</h3>
<p>孫氏又謂關於中山港開港問題現正委托荷蘭公司即派荷工程師赴粤實地測量俟有整個的報告後再與黄埔築港公開的比較利弊再定開築河港標準就築港經費而言中山港似稍較黄埔爲節省也</p>
<h3>哈斯報告</h3>
<p>國際聯盟會經濟交通衛生三部長運袂來華係應國府之聘建議改善計劃交通部長哈斯余迭與會晤其貢獻意見範圍側重於導淮及各項水利交通事業現因來華未久諸多隔膜尙未能發表具體意見將來或擬北上視察調查周祥後再提出整個報告供國府參考</p>
<h3>兩路增價</h3>
<p>京滬杭路增加票價事孫氏謂鐵部確有不得己之苦衷蓋京滬路去年之總收入爲一千三百萬元但去年到期債欵之第二期還本金尙未付過再加以本年到期之第三期還本金共計在五百萬元左右同時去年積欠所購入機車列車材料等約須二百餘萬元再加應付息金及各項修理費等總計約一千萬元而每年經常支出爲一千三百萬元故本年度共須支出二千三百萬元增加票價後預算年可增收二百六十萬元則本年總收入不過一千五百餘萬元收支兩抵不敷之數尙巨非特加整頓另籌辦法不可也</p>
<h3>扣車放還</h3>
<p>記者旋詢以各軍扣車實際有否放還孫氏謂各軍扣車確己陸續放還石友三部亦僅餘一小部份其餘均爲臨時零星調借無關大計云云最後叩以胡漢民氏之病狀答謂己日見痊可矣</p>

<p>肺癆療法之新發見</p>
<p>德國肺病療養雜誌抄譯</p>
<h3>何謂肺癆菌</h3>
<p>肺结絯菌（即肺癆菌）係桿狀之細菌其體形眞直或稍變曲長徑約一迷達之百萬分一五非肉眼所能見據一定之方法以熱練之手段製爲染色標本用六百倍至一千倍之顯微鏡檢視之始克窺知實爲極小之物也</p>
<p>古昔之時中國名之曰癆咳蟲現今則人皆知結核菌爲肺病之蟲不屬於動物界之系統蓋吾人之周圍有無數之下等微生物存在即通稱么微有機體爲肉眼所不能見此么微有機體分爲動物性與植物性二種屬於動物性者日原始蟲屬於植物性者日微菌此下等植物之黴菌屬於隠花植物之一科無葉綠素微菌之中又視形狀性質分爲「絲狀微菌」「芽性黴菌」「分裂黴菌」之三種</p>
<h3>肺癆菌之殖民政策</h3>
<p>分裂黴菌之繁殖本諸自身之分裂作用即自一而化爲二自二化爲四日漸增加故有分裂黴菌之稱人類及他種動物往往因之發生疾病故稱日「病原菌」因形狀之不同又分爲「球狀黴菌」「桿狀黴菌」「螺旋狀黴菌」之三種肺癆菌即分裂微菌中之桿狀菌</p>
<p>肺癆菌在肺病患者之痰中混之最多常視患者病勞之輕重而有增减據德國海角雷兒博士謂肺病患者之痰一塊中含有三萬萬之結核菌故小時内咯痰一次者一晝夜中有七十二萬萬之結核菌自結核患者之體内而排出散布於空氣中世間之人日夜被其侵襲然此多數之病菌果何自而生乎蓋分裂菌之本體有分裂作用己如前述其日漸增加繁殖者職是之故起始時原屬一個黴菌其後漸分裂由一爲由二爲四依次遞推增殖之勢力日漸廣大今試假定增殖之速力每一小時營分裂作用一次則二十四小時内一個之黴菌己化爲一千六百萬個矣由是以觀則下述之事項可推測而知</p>
<p>（一）黴菌繁殖力如何旺盛</p>
<p>（二）究因何故而患者之體中發生無數病菌</p>
<p>（三）患者之痰究因何故而有無數之肺結核菌</p>
<h3>肺癆菌之抵抗力</h3>
<p>肺結核菌之抵抗力非常强盛推知其抵抗力之大小爲肺病豫防及治療上之最緊要者結核患者之痰放置空氣中時結核黴菌之生存可達半年以上置於光線缺乏之暗室内則一年以上尙得保其生存此種黴菌對於寒冷之抵抗力尤爲强大遇攝氏零下十度之寒冷經六七星期而不死對於温熱之抵抗力亦較他種黴菌爲强他種黴菌遇攝氏六十度之温度經二三十分鐘便行死滅而此種黴菌須八十度之温度經二三十分鐘始克死滅惟對於日光之抵抗力最爲荏弱遇直射之日光經五六分鐘便死遇攝氏百度以上之温熱一二分鐘便死若就消毒藥而論肺病患者之結核菌在二十倍石炭酸水中歷三十秒鐘而死在百倍石炭酸水中歷一分鐘而死在千倍昇汞水中歷十分鐘而死</p>
<p>德國愛　满博士製生理的肺臟的愛克斯線像</p>
<h3>肺癆菌脱蠟殺滅法</h3>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌而此菌一入人體内則於該處便成結節以斷血行之路又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質包圍其體以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入故雖用種種殺菌藥内服或注射終不能遠其病菌之實體内歷來醫家所慣用之百然療法對症療法理學的療法血清療法藥劑療法及其他一切治療法等尙未完全成功而肺病無藥之説遍满於一世者因未知此深奥學理故耳由此現代結核學者根據上述之學理繼續研究不遺餘力結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑名曰三那星SANOOIN此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脱蠟術發明家德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實騐報告此藥有滲透肺病窀之結節及溶解蠟質之作用兼具有殺菌力能根治一二三期之肺癆確有萬試萬　之特效在中國業經國民政府中央衛生試騐所化騐藥性和平無毒絶無任何副作用茲略舉醫治作用於下</p>
<p>（一）設於試騐管中實騐（三那星）之藥力作用則一分鐘後結核菌皆消失其抗酸性至三分鐘後則此肺結核菌完全殺盡無一倖免</p>
<p>（二）依動物試騐則發見（三那星）能滲入結核病　内設檢查其病　内潛伏之結核菌則盡失其抗酸性此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服（三那星）星期左右則立兄咯痰稀釋體熱下降等良好狀態</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服（三那星）達三十天至六十天以上則顯見體重增加食慾激進一切症狀逐漸緩和終達其回天再造之偉功</p>
<p>奉送三那星實騐報告書及肺病療養指導書函索即寄上海仁記路三十五號（即四川路仁記路口）美商愛世開洋行科學部啟與本埠糖商簽訂承銷合同後方啓程遄返庇氏昨語本報記者古巴糖業在華推銷之計劃行將見諸實施日下一切必要手續業己商妥不久即可有廉價之古巴糖開始運來中國渠等調查糖市結果深信古巴糖産大可推銷於此間目下中國人民所出糖價昂於他處而品質又非最優者當此糖價大跌之際實非應有之現象將來古巴糖運销中國後旣可減低糖價同時又能爲中國製造品啓一推銷之路因國輩不僅欲運糖來華且擬運華貨往銷古巴也至若輩此來專爲推銷起見並不謀向政府獲得特别讓與權云</p>

<p>Wang Zhengting</p>
<p>Reports on the Recent Diplomatic Situation</p>
<p>Mo Dehui Decides to Depart for Russia from Harbin Tomorrow</p>
<p>Negotiations on the Issue of Extraterritoriality are Actively Underway</p>
<p>Nanjing, Wang Zhengting, on the morning of the 13th, received reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs auditorium and reported on the recent diplomatic situation as follows: (1) The complete treaties signed between China and foreign countries, namely the so-called treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation, such as the issues of friendly tariffs and extraterritoriality, are all included in the treaties. All unequal aspects have been fully explained in the treaties. The two most complete examples are: first, the Sino-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation; and second, the Sino-Czech Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation. After the signing of the Sino-Polish Commercial Treaty, the Polish government did not fully understand some points, so the ratification procedures have not yet been completed by both parties. After the signing of the Sino-Czech Commercial Treaty, both parties immediately ratified it, and it became effective. The first Czech Minister to China, Mr. Fitzer, has already arrived in Shanghai and is scheduled to come to Nanjing on the morning of the 16th to formally present his credentials.

<h3>The Silver Problem</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Nanjing, the U.S. Senate has proposed three items regarding the raw silver issue. The original text was sent from the U.S. by Lin Baik and is very long. It is currently being translated. The first is the issue of Indian dumping, the second is the convening of an international silver price conference, and the third is the issue of loans to China. However, according to today's Washington telegram, President Hoover has not yet formally stated his position on the proposal passed by the former Senate's Pittman to convene an international conference. Some of Mr. Hoover's advisors say that the U.S. President will shelve the suggestion to convene a conference, and others say that even if such a conference is convened, its agenda will be restricted to avoid embarrassing the countries involved. Furthermore, it is generally believed that if India does not stop selling silver, the price of silver will never return to its original level. As a result, President Hoover is delaying taking action to avoid harming the relationship between the United States and Britain. Therefore, the second issue of convening an international conference is difficult to realize. As for the third issue of lending silver to China, due to the interconnected interests of various countries and the lack of expression from the Chinese government, the United States has no determination to implement a loan independently. Therefore, the third proposal is just a proposal. In short, the Pittman proposal passed by the U.S. Senate can now be said to have disappeared invisibly.</p>
<p>I have said before that in today's international affairs, if the interests involved extend beyond one country, it is difficult for discussions to become reality. The silver problem is one such example.</p>

Conservative leader Baldwin then opened the debate by first stating the contents of the 1917 declaration and reiterating the Conservative Party's views, saying that the Conservative Party recognizes that the British Empire is a living organism that is constantly evolving. The course of evolution will determine the extent of the relationship between the self-governing dominions and the mother country, which even a few years ago few could have foreseen. We cannot assume that India alone will remain static in the evolution of the world. The remarks made by Peel on January 26 have not been refuted and the Conservative Party has not changed them. The remarks he (Baldwin) made last week in Newton are also still adhered to by the Conservative Party. He said at the time, "Our objective is very clear, and what is that objective? It is an All-India Federation. However, since we have stated the objective, we must not forget that there are many difficulties to overcome before it can be achieved." What we have now is only an empty structure, and the content remains to be filled in. And this content is not without various major difficulties. The Conservative Party has no other constraints except to undertake sincere efforts to face difficulties and implement the work of the Round Table Conference. The Round Table Conference did not discuss the internal structure to fill this empty structure. Now we must examine how to achieve an Indian Federation without abandoning the necessary guarantees that have been clearly and practically stated and are the basis for any future solution. He only wanted to add one word: no matter what the people of the country have seen or heard, the cooperation between the political parties in the country that has existed since the establishment of the Simon Commission has not been broken to this day and is no different from the past. The newspaper editorials of the past two days can be said to have been much ado about nothing. After the Round Table Conference ends, the government must decide on the second step to continue its work. This is very obvious and is merely a matter of procedure. The government is of course considering various methods of action. One suggestion submitted to the Conservative Party for consideration is to send representatives to India. He consulted with his colleagues, who all believed that it was the responsibility of the current government to handle this matter before the details were finalized. This is not a question of the Conservative Party ceasing cooperation. He has already told the government, and now he tells the House of Commons that the Conservative Party is always willing to be consulted. Everyone knows that there are different opinions within the Conservative Party on this issue. Whether the representatives who attended the London Round Table Conference will go to India today is a matter of great concern to many Conservatives. He relieved their anxiety and told them his opinion (i.e., he did not participate in the proposal for a Round Table Conference within India). On Sunday, colleagues came to ask whether the decision could be announced. He felt that it was better not to announce it for the time being. This kind of conversation was not intended to be public, but he soon learned that a member of his party had passed the news to an opposition newspaper, so he decided to publish his opinion himself. He certainly knew that the result might cause repercussions within India, but he believed that his previous and current statements, when major issues are still under negotiation, do not want to drastically change India's existing constitution immediately. As for the talks between the Viceroy and Gandhi, he strongly disagreed with the use of words such as "victory" and "surrender." Some people said that he surrendered to Churchill, but in fact there was no such thing as surrender, nor was there such thing as victory, but only the victory of common sense. In 1920, Churchill said regarding the Egyptian issue that the British way of doing things included close and permanent cooperation with the people of that country. This method is even more effective in India. Now, summarizing the Indian situation with these words can be said to be accurate and unwavering (listeners laughed). The result of the talks between Irwin and Gandhi was something that others could not have achieved in this environment. Extremism within India and within Britain is not easy to eliminate for a time, but in any case, this solution has effectively expanded the scope of goodwill and cooperation. The question of the Indian constitutional government is of vital importance and is the most difficult issue we face. On the imperial issue, the unity of all parties is more important than the unity of one party. Many people are blind to the rapid changes in the East. The final outcome within India does not lie in force, but in goodwill, sympathy, and understanding between Britain and India. After years of suspicion, Irwin used his ability and personality to bridge the emotions of both sides. This is Irwin's great work, and his name will be forever enshrined in history as one of Britain's greatest governors. He believed that most Conservative members in the House of Commons or in the country did not hold dissenting views on the remarks previously made by Lord Peel and those recently made by him in Newton. Since he is the leader of the party, he is willing to implement this policy with a spirit of courage and without fear. If the majority of the party is unwilling to deal with the Indian issue with this spirit, it may be necessary to choose another party leader. If he is in the minority, please do not create difficulties and obstruct the undertaking that is almost beyond human capacity, because the welfare and longevity of the empire depends on the successful completion of this matter. (Applause) Secretary of State for India Benn said that after Baldwin's historically valuable remarks, there was really no need to add anything more to the points of view on the Indian situation. He thought that all aspects of India would be delighted to read his remarks, and the Viceroy would be especially excited. Since Baldwin did not go against Lord Peel's declaration of January 26, the work that the government and the opposition are currently undertaking can proceed smoothly and be completed. The Indian representatives to the London Round Table Conference understood the credibility of the British Parliament and returned to India, so they were able to explain the work of the conference to their people. As a result, the scope of cooperation has been greatly expanded. Now it is known that Gandhi is taking cooperation as a policy instead of non-cooperation, and he has stated that he wants to reserve his energy to make a temporary solution into a permanent solution. The results of his talks with Irwin have been praised throughout India, and there has been significant progress in trade. An atmosphere has been created in which previously difficult problems can be easily resolved in the future. The British government is extremely willing to continue the constitutional discussion of the Round Table Conference without any obstacles. The government has carefully considered the issue of sending parliamentary representatives to India to reorganize the Round Table Conference together with representatives of the All-India Congress. However, this proposal is not very suitable because the issue of Parliament is very important and the Indians in India also have many preparations to make. In particular, there are some issues that have not been resolved by the Minorities Committee, so the government believes that this kind of work within India is extremely important. The government will seek the cooperation of the leaders of all parties in India. Once the All-India Congress and representatives from all aspects are ready to resume discussions, the government will invite them to Britain to begin the work of the Federal Relations Committee. The government hopes that this committee can be conducted in the summer, and the special issues outlined by the Round Table Conference can be investigated by experts at the same time. In this way, all issues can be finally discussed in early autumn. Churchill rose and said that the development of the past six months in advocating the establishment of an All-India Federation as a precursor to complete self-government may be considered a congratulatory event. However, it is understandable that those who consider this kind of conduct to be premature and dangerous and may lead to turmoil and disaster are not as optimistic about this development. Although the Conservative Party's decision not to participate in the Round Table Conference within India has made up for a lot, the chances of success of the agreement jointly made by all levels of India and the approval of the British Parliament are very slim, and the possibility of destruction is very high. Prime Minister MacDonald concluded a debate, saying briefly that a letter had been issued to the Viceroy proposing to help the Federal Structure Committee to convene in London as soon as possible. There is now hope that Gandhi will attend. The Round Table Conference has arranged the preconditions for the federal structure. This work is currently being carried out in India and London. We are now placing a test on British honor, but it is not only testing British honor, but also testing Britain's ability to deal with a very difficult political situation. The House of Commons then passed the India Office budget. Also, a telegram stated that the impact of Baldwin's remarks in the House of Commons this afternoon was extremely rapid. The general public's suspicions about the Conservative Party in the past few days have been completely dispelled. As soon as Baldwin finished speaking and sat down, someone commented that this was Baldwin's greatest argument in his life, and Secretary of State for India Benn also said at the beginning of his subsequent speech that Baldwin's remarks were historically valuable. Churchill's remarks were not welcomed by the public. This was the first time that Churchill was not welcomed by the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th – Members of Parliament from all three parties consider Baldwin's remarks to be one of the most cautious remarks in Baldwin's many years of political career and will likely have an important impact in India, dispelling any misunderstandings that may exist.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bhavnagar, Bombay Province, 12th – Gandhi set off from here this morning to tour the Kaira district. This trip will end at Dandi on the coast of the Indian Ocean. Gandhi intends to make salt from seawater again in that place on Saturday, but this time it will be done in accordance with the agreement with the Indian government. Accompanying him is Patel, the elected chairman of the All-India Congress to be held in Karachi. Gandhi led a volunteer team from here to Dandi on the same day of the same month last year to defy the Indian government's laws and make salt on the beach.</p>

The cabinet suffered a defeat, and the government was greatly shaken. However, because Laval was unwilling to treat it as a vote of confidence beforehand, it did not directly affect the fate of the cabinet. However, at a time when the turmoil in the Aéropostale Company case is raging and the situation is tense, this failure is indeed an ominous sign.</p>

<h3>Sun Lianzhong Arrives in Jiangxi from Nanjing</h3>
<p>Jiangxi Province to Hold Bandit Suppression Conference</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondent: The 26th Route Army has successively arrived in Jiangxi to suppress bandits. General Commander Sun Lianzhong also left Nanjing on the 8th with personnel from the General Command Headquarters, taking a steamer westward. He arrived in Jiujiang on the 10th and was warmly welcomed by all sectors. Sun stayed in Jiujiang for one night and took a special train on the Nanxun Railway to the provincial capital on the morning of the 11th. Representatives from all sectors in the provincial capital and leaders of various agencies and groups were waiting at the Niuhang Railway Station. Minister He Yingqin also led Chief of Staff He of the Xingying to the ferry crossing outside Zhangjiangmen to welcome him. Sun's special train arrived at the Niuhang Railway Station at about 1 p.m. Sun got off the train in the midst of military music and greeted the welcoming personnel. He then went to the ferry crossing, boarded the ferry, shook hands with Minister He, and then went straight to the Xingyuan to rest. Along the way, the Garrison Headquarters, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, and the 27th Division Headquarters sent teams to protect him. After a moment of rest, Sun went to the General Headquarters to pay his respects to He Yingqin and discuss the organization and progress of the Qingxiang Supervisory Office. At the same time, he also asked about the bandits. After leaving, he went to the Lu Residence in Beitan to pay his respects to Lu Dipin. Lu then held a dinner for Sun in the provincial government that evening. Those who accompanied him included Minister He, Supervisor Wang, and important figures from the political and business circles. During the dinner, there was also an informal discussion about bandit suppression. It is said that since He and Sun have arrived in Jiangxi, a bandit suppression conference will be held in the coming days. The allocation of troops in various places, the coordination of various route armies, and the encirclement and suppression plan will be decided at this meeting. Also, Sun, the Jiangxi Qingxiang Supervisor, has long been in office, and the officials of the Supervisory Office are all transferred from the General Command Headquarters, so the office can officially operate in the coming days.

<h3>Chongyi County in Jiangxi Province Recovered</h3>
<p>Li Mingrui's Band Flees Back into Hunan</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondent: The bandit communist Li Mingrui's band wandered around the border of Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, burning and looting terribly. Therefore, the 8th Route Army of Guangdong Province had news of a large-scale entry into Jiangxi to join in the suppression. Recently, it was heard that the two divisions of Li Yangjing and Xiang Hanping entered Jiangxi from Dayu and Sannan in the northeast and joined the 19th Route Army. Jiang Guangyu, the General Commander of the 19th Route Army, has also arrived in Dayu from Shao and will soon arrive in Ganzhou to transfer to Yudu to command the suppression of bandits. However, the day before, Li's band fled from Hunan and captured Chongyi. Jiang Guangyu then ordered Ma Kun's brigade of the 12th Division to advance from Ganzhou to Chongyi to suppress them, and also ordered the 14th Regiment of the 60th Division to advance to Chongyi. It was heard that they had recovered Chongyi County on the afternoon of the 5th. Li then led his remnants to flee back to Hunan Province. In this battle, dozens of bandits were killed, five were captured alive, and more than 80 rifles and countless reactionary propaganda items were seized. The pursuit is still underway. As for the major bandit communists in Xinfeng and Yudu, they have all been basically pacified. Zhu and Mao have a tendency to collapse towards the Fujian border through Ruijin and Shicheng, but yesterday Zhu Mian, the representative sent by Liu Heding to visit He, claimed that the vanguard of the division had arrived at the Jiangxi border and that Commander Liu would also come to Jiangxi from Yanping to assist in the suppression. Zhu and Mao are already in a state of encirclement. (March 11)</p>

<h3>Xiangying Business Tax Still in Stalemate</h3>
<p>Changsha Chamber of Commerce Requests Delay</p>
<p>Provincial Government Issues Proclamation Strictly Prohibiting Resistance</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: After Hunan Province abolished the consolidated tax on January 1st, it dispatched personnel to establish a business tax collection bureau to implement business tax. However, due to disputes among local chambers of commerce regarding the collection methods and tax rates, collection has not been implemented to this day. For the past two months, the various business tax bureaus have only incurred expenses without any revenue. Zhang Kailian, the Director of the Finance Department, believes that business tax is a method clearly stipulated by the central government to compensate for the abolition of the likin tax and is imperative. The collection rules and regulations formulated by Hunan Province have already been submitted to the central government for approval and cannot be changed again. Therefore, he submitted a request to He Jian for approval, ordering all officials to strictly implement them. If there is any resistance, they will be strictly arrested and dealt with. However, the Changsha Chamber of Commerce requests that the implementation be temporarily suspended until the tax regulations are revised. If the government uses coercive measures to suppress the merchants and people, the Changsha merchants and people will go on strike to resist. The four points that they request to be revised are: (1) Unclear classification. The business tax is levied on the business, not on the goods. The luxury of goods cannot be equated with the luxury of business. However, the various luxury businesses listed in the first category of Article 3 of the Hunan Province Business Tax Collection Regulations, such as hardware, glass, electricity, Western medicine, etc., are either necessary for daily use or are domestic products that should be promoted. They cannot all be regarded as luxury goods. Furthermore, although there are independently operated stores for porcelain, textiles, shoes, hats, socks, and towels, the foreign and general merchandise business includes all of the above. Since they are listed as both ordinary and luxury, and the tax rates are different, disputes will inevitably arise during collection. This is the first point that should be revised. (2) Improper tax standards. Article 4 of the Hunan Province Business Tax Collection Regulations lists special business tax rates, such as Qianzhuang (money shops), which are proposed to be taxed at 0.02% of the business capital. Qianzhuang are originally the financial hubs, and often the funds are very small. However, the total amount of transferring funds can exceed the original amount by more than ten times. Since the virtual number is large and the profit is very small, they are different from ordinary commodity trading businesses. How can the business capital be used as a standard? Furthermore, Qianhang and Qianzhuang are of the same nature. It is unfair to exclude Qianhang from the scope. The Shanghai and Hankou Qianye Gonghui (Money Industry Association) have already requested the Ministry of Finance to allow them to be treated the same as banks. Hunan Province cannot be unique. Furthermore, insurance companies are taxed at 0.8% of the insurance amount. In the case of this city, the insurance premium obtained from the insurance amount is also mostly 0.8%. Savings associations are taxed at 1% of the savings amount, which is even equal to the interest rate. It may be insufficient to pay taxes with their income alone. For other industries such as brokers, warehouses, transshipment, livestock trading, and contracting, since they are not luxury or businesses that should be banned, their tax rates should be calculated according to the capital amount as stipulated in the general outline, and cannot be as high as 2%, or calculated according to the business amount cannot exceed 0.2%. However, they are taxed at 5% of the remuneration amount or 2% of the business amount, which is even more contrary to the general outline. As for the oil, salt, cotton yarn, and other industries, they are all necessities for daily use, and the industry itself has low profits. A transaction of 1,000 yuan only yields a profit of one or two yuan. The business amount cannot be used as a standard. This is the second point that should be revised. (3) The tax collection period is too rushed. Article 4 of the supplementary measures to the general outline stipulates that the tax collection period should be monthly or quarterly, which should be determined by each province according to its circumstances. Hunan is an area ravaged by bandits and communists and should be collected quarterly so that merchants have room to raise funds. Even in terms of customs, such as the Finance Department's collection of house rent and shop police donations, are collected quarterly, and there is no precedent for monthly collection. This is the third point that should be revised. (4) Difficulties in maintaining disaster relief records and monthly settlements. Articles 7, 8, and 9 of the Hunan Province Business Tax Regulations stipulate strict regulations for maintaining various disaster relief records. In the case of Changsha City, most small and medium-sized merchants are uneducated, and it is absolutely impossible to require them to fully maintain all kinds of disaster relief records. Even if the stores with slightly larger scales have complete disaster relief records, it is impossible to settle accounts monthly. According to the meaning of Article 3 of the supplementary measures to the general outline, the tax amount payable for the following year should be determined in advance. Therefore, there is no mandatory requirement for maintaining disaster relief records and settling accounts monthly, and there is no need for such severe penalties and the method of affixing the bureau's seal. Furthermore, the fees for issuing business licenses are collected according to the level. The review committee is also added with the Public Security Bureau and the county government as members, and its power is too narrow. All these sections are in conflict with the general outline and must be abolished. The Changsha Chamber of Commerce insists on the above four points. Unless revisions are made, they will not comply. In addition to notifying all industries and businesses in Changsha City to refuse investigation and not pay business tax before the revisions are made, they have also telegraphed to the chambers of commerce in various counties and cities to proceed in unison. The provincial government, on the other hand, believes that the regulations and rules formulated by Hunan Province have been submitted to the central government for approval and cannot allow a few merchants and people to obstruct them unreasonably. Furthermore, Changsha is the model for the entire province. If Changsha cannot be implemented, the entire province cannot be promoted. Therefore, it has decided to adopt strict measures to actively force implementation. Anyone who refuses to be investigated will be arrested and dealt with, regardless of who they are. Even a strike will not be tolerated. The official and the merchants seem to be gradually moving towards extreme ends. It is unknown whether it can be resolved peacefully. The proclamation issued by the provincial government to arrest and deal with those who resist is copied below to show the severity: "It has been investigated that Hunan Province is implementing business tax after the abolition of the consolidated tax in accordance with the clear orders of the Yuan Department. The various regulations and rules have been revised by the Finance Department in accordance with the promulgated general outline and supplementary measures and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and submitted to the meeting of this government committee for resolution and promulgation. The tax rates set are light, and the collection procedures are extremely simple to facilitate merchants and people. However, it has been found that a few merchants and people in Changsha City are delaying resistance under the pretext of not accepting the investigation by the Business Tax Collection Bureau. Among them, there are obviously rogue elements who are taking the opportunity to instigate obstruction of the new tax. They do not think that the current business tax is the only new tax after the tax system reform, and it is common throughout the country. Its outline regulations and rules have been repeatedly collected from merchants in various places by the central government before being promulgated and implemented. The current regulations and collection in Hunan Province are also based on the laws and decrees of the Yuan Department and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation. It is impossible to allow a few merchants and people to obstruct unreasonably. Furthermore, it has been investigated that the merchants and people of Hunan Province used to bear the consolidated tax, and the government collected more than 7 million yuan annually. Now, the business tax is estimated to be only more than 1 million yuan for the entire year. This is a gain for the merchants and people, and they should not hold different opinions. In addition to strictly ordering the Changsha Chamber of Commerce to comply with the repeated orders to convey compliance, a proclamation is hereby issued to all merchants and people to be aware that this business tax is very important to the local revenue of the province. You must all comply with the regulations, declare and obtain licenses, and pay taxes on time. Do not delay resistance under the pretext. If there are unscrupulous people who hold on to it and deliberately resist, they will be strictly investigated and dealt with according to the law without any leniency." (March 4th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Stipulates Business Tax Rates</h3>
<p>Taxable Scope and Tax Rates Have Been Revised by the Preparatory Office</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since Guangdong Province abolished the likin tax, the treasury revenue has suddenly decreased. In order to offset the reduced income, the Finance Department has decided to prepare for the provincial business tax. A business tax preparatory office was established earlier to investigate the taxable scope and determine the tax rates. The preparatory office has held seven meetings. Only at the last meeting was the proposed scope and tax rates of the business tax revised and passed. The following is a excerpt: Commodity sales industry: 1% of the capital amount, 6% of the shop rent, 6 yuan per employee. Commodity leasing industry: 1% of the capital amount, 6% of the shop rent, 3 yuan per employee. Money shop industry: 4% of the reward amount, 7% of the shop rent, 6 yuan per employee. Newspaper office industry: 4% of the reward amount, 7% of the shop rent, 6 yuan per employee. Agency industry: 4% of the reward amount, 7% of the shop rent, 6 yuan per employee. Printing and export industry: 0.3% of the capital amount, 6% of the shop rent, 3 yuan per employee. Photography industry: 1% of the capital amount, 7% of the shop rent, 9 yuan per employee. Hotel industry: 1% of the capital amount, 7% of the shop rent, 3 yuan per employee. Restaurant industry: 0.15% of the business amount, 7% of the shop rent, 6 yuan per employee. Tea house industry: 1% of the capital amount, 6% of the shop rent, 3 yuan per employee. Western clothing industry: 1.5% of the capital amount, 7% of the shop rent, 9 yuan per employee.

<h3>Contending for the Abolition of the Henan Additional Security Fee</h3>
<p>Li Mingzhong, Ji Hongchang, Liang Guanying, Liu Zhenhua, and Jing Rif, telegraph to Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of Henan Province, Kaifeng: Chairman Liu, after reading your telegram regarding the reduction of donations and taxes and the reorganization of the people's groups, we deeply admire your consideration for the country and your people. As fellow villagers and comrades-in-arms, we should express our opinions frankly and without reservation. Regarding the two points you mentioned, one is to reduce the burden and the other is to reorganize the people's groups, it seems that the actual situation does not match and the laws and regulations are not fully followed. The measures decided by your province this time include additional construction, autonomy, public security, and political police items, each at 25%, local public funds, and county people's groups, each at 30%, and education at 60%, totaling 2.2 yuan, which is already more than double the regular tax. The Finance Department's subsidy of 30% is not included. If a new security fee of 60% is added, it clearly contradicts the Ministry of Finance's order that the additional tax should not exceed the regular tax. Furthermore, the construction, autonomy, public security, political police, education, and people's groups items in each county have fixed amounts and constant uses. It is feared that it will not be easy to reduce them. Your government's attention to the control of the powerful and the supervision of the people is indeed a fundamental discussion, but being able to cut the extra extravagance without reducing the necessary uses is even more important at the beginning of political tutelage. If the old amount of government expenses is reduced due to the new security fee, causing the essential policies of construction, autonomy, public security, and education to be stranded, the weighing of the priorities is not advisable. As for reorganizing the existing standing people's groups in each county into security teams, your government's intention to maintain local security and enable the people to receive unified training is good, but it contradicts the central government's promulgated regulations on the organization of security teams and the county defense laws. In principle, the security team is a local pacification unit under the control of the provincial government, while the defense force is a people's self-defense group under the county's organization. In terms of organization, the security team is recruited with the team as the largest unit, while the defense group is organized by obligation with the li, pai, xiang, and district as the organization. In terms of responsibilities, the security team is responsible for the security of the entire province and has regulations for defense and transfer, while the defense force is recruited by the defense district and is based on the principle of not leaving the county. In terms of funding, the security team's expenses are paid by the provincial treasury and the salaries are determined by the provincial government, while the defense group's expenses are raised locally by the chief of the defense group. Except for the personnel responsible for training and handling documents, all are honorary positions. The above points are fundamentally different. The telegram stated that the security and people's groups cannot be divided into two, which is exactly what we mean by not being able to be combined into one. If it is said that the separation of security and people's groups does not conform to the original meaning of a democratic country, then changing the people's groups into security teams means transferring what belongs to the people to the province, which seems to be not fully in line with the original meaning of a democratic country. In short, what we are worried about is that the disaster victims cannot be burdened again, not that the security team cannot be established. The people's groups and the security teams cannot be confused, not that the people and the government can be opposed. Your government's discussion on the reorganization of additional taxes is correct, but it is not correct to add new items after the reorganization. It is okay to unify the training of the people's groups, but it is not okay to change them into security teams. The words in your telegram that the province established four groups and paid 200,000 in monthly expenses are far from the truth. No matter how many new items are added, the additional tax has a fixed number, and the facts have not changed fundamentally, so there is no misunderstanding. We are thinking about the welfare of the people in your province, reducing the pain of the people in Henan, and putting the people's groups and security teams on the right track. We dare not speak highly or harbor any prejudices. We still hope that you will understand our sincerity and allow us to cancel the additional security fee and organize the security team in accordance with the regulations. Then, tens of millions of disaster victims who are on the verge of death will feel the kindness of being reborn, and it is not just our personal wish. We sincerely beg you and look forward to it.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Contents of the Shanxi Arsenal</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Recently, the Shanxi Arsenal has been closed by the headquarters, and the funds for the factory have not been available since March. Thousands of workers in the factory are panicked. Therefore, the atmosphere of changing the arsenal into a civil livelihood agency has become more and more intense in recent days. Zhou Jun of the factory talked about the situation of the factory in detail, saying that the organization of the Taiyuan Arsenal, except for the smokeless powder factory which is separately compiled, has a total of 16 large and small branch factories with about 8,000 workers. Including the more than 200 workers in the powder factory, the monthly expenditure is about 200,000. There are more than 2,600 sets of installed machinery. There are currently three installed generators with a total of 2600KW. There is also one 3000KW generator that has been ordered but not yet shipped. The names and general descriptions of each factory are as follows: (1) Electric Power Factory: This factory has two water towers built to store water from the city to supply the steam engines. The electricity generated by this factory is distributed to each factory to power the work. (2) Artillery Factory: This factory is divided into two major departments: mountain guns and field guns. There are about 600 sets of installed machinery. The construction of the mountain gun factory is particularly perfect. (3) Heavy Artillery Factory: The scale of this factory is even larger and is the crown of each branch factory. The value of its machinery accounts for more than 90% of the entire factory. Its machinery has not yet been completely installed. (4) Artillery Shell Factory: This factory is divided into two major departments: mountain gun shells and field gun shells. There are more than 400 sets of installed machinery. Most of its machinery is manufactured in the province. The factory building is wider than other factories. (5) Rifle Factory: This factory has about 500 sets of machinery. There are many light milling machines. There are about 100 factory buildings. (6) Machine Gun Factory (7) Submachine Gun Factory (8) Mechanical Factory: The total number of ordinary machines installed in these three factories is more than 700 sets, which is smaller than the scale of the above factories. The mechanical factory and the machine gun factory each have more than a dozen large machines, all of which are light machines. The factory buildings are also very simple. (9) Carpentry Factory (10) Iron Factory (11) Smelting Factory: These three factories are prototype factories designed to assist the work of each factory. The scale is very small. (12) Dual-Purpose Fuze Factory (13) Copper Shell Pressing Factory (14) Medicine Pressing Factory: These three factories are specifically designed to assist the artillery shell factory. The local area is even smaller. (15) Rifle Bullet Factory (16) Bomb Factory: In one of these two factories, there are not many installed machines, and in the other, they are specialized machines for manufacturing rifle bullets. It seems impossible to transform them into other industries. (17) Cannery: There are only about a dozen machines in this factory. The shears can be converted into thin metal (brocade pots, foreign porcelain, etc.) factories to manufacture social products with a wide range. According to the situation of the above-mentioned branch factories, except that most of the specialized machines in the rifle bullet factory and the dual-purpose fuze, copper shell pressing, and medicine pressing factories cannot be transformed into other production industries, the remaining carpentry, iron, smelting, and artillery factories. The artillery shell factory, rifle factory, machine gun, submachine gun, and mechanical factory all have related relationships for transforming production industries. 80% to 90% of the machines installed in these six factories are ordinary machines. The types are: 1. Lathe 2. Milling machine or universal milling machine or vertical milling machine 3. Planer or shaper 4. Slotting machine 5. Drilling machine or radial drilling machine. However, a few parts in the artillery factory, such as the Uninesal Plaue Miliing Mavhire, Vesticai B oring Taring Mill, and Glas Habbling Milling Machine, are unique to other factories. The construction and machinery of the heavy artillery department of the artillery factory are quite suitable for transforming various types of machines, such as locomotives. The mountain artillery department is particularly suitable for converting various types of carriages. The rifle factory and artillery shell factory are suitable for converting mining machinery, water pumps, cranes, etc. (March 2nd)</p>

<h3>Speech on the Mission of the Kuomintang</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Wu Tiecheng, a special envoy of the Central Committee to inspect the Party affairs in the Northeast, gave a speech on "The Mission of the Kuomintang" at the invitation of the Liaoning National Common Sense Promotion Association on the 8th of this month. The following is a record of the speech:</p>
<p>Chairman and Comrades, today is the spring conference of the Northeast National Common Sense Promotion Association. The staff of each county reported on the work done during the winter vacation. Just now I heard the chairman say that you took advantage of the winter vacation to return to your hometowns to serve the society. This is a very meaningful job. As far as the situation of ordinary students is concerned, they usually study at school day and night, and they can take advantage of the vacation to rest or gather with relatives and friends at home. Who would be willing to do that kind of purely voluntary work? However, you can give up your right to rest and return to your hometowns to serve the society regardless of the cold weather. This spirit of sacrifice is truly admirable. I hope that you will always maintain this spirit of independence. Not only can you expect success in your studies and careers, but also the transformation of Chinese society will be greatly influenced.</p>
<p>The chairman asked me to say a few words before you report on your work. This is a great honor and willingness for me. Because I am thousands of miles away, it is difficult to have an opportunity to meet with the Northeast youth who are enthusiastic about serving the society. I am a member of the Chinese Kuomintang, and this time I am here to inspect the Party affairs in the Northeast, so of course I will talk about the Party. There is a saying in Guandong, "This is because I am this." So please don't laugh at me for saying that three sentences are inseparable from my profession.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister of our Party, Sun Yat-sen, is the leader who created the Republic of China. In order to create a free and equal Republic of China, he invented the Three Principles of the People. In order to implement the Three Principles of the People of saving and building the country, he created a Chinese Kuomintang that first implemented the ideology. Today, what I want to talk about is "The Mission of the Chinese Kuomintang." In a simple sentence, the mission of the Chinese Kuomintang is to follow the Prime Minister's legacy and implement the Three Principles of the People. The principles of the Three Principles of the People are the culmination of the world's revolutionary theories. Its purpose is based on the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation, the extension of civil rights, and the satisfaction of people's livelihood to achieve the Great Harmony of the world. What a great mission and what a difficult job.</p>
<p>The inequality of the nation is due to the machinations of imperialists. Imperialism originated 500 years ago and only achieved great success in the 19th century. The movement of full people's politics has only occurred in the last 100 years. In the past, the politics of all countries in the world were dominated by theocracy and monarchy. Now, there are still remnants of it. As for the decline of people's livelihood, it is due to the development of individual capitalism. A small number of people have gained an economically superior position, and the majority of the working people are living in harsh conditions. This is not only the case in economically backward China, but also in the industrialized countries of Europe and the United States. We want to solve the above three problems in one go, which is really not an easy task. However, we will never be afraid of difficulties and seek temporary ease. With the Prime Minister's Three Principles of the People, we believe that our efforts can achieve the goal and are not far away. The Chinese Kuomintang has struggled for more than 30 years, overcoming all obstacles and sweeping away all reactionary forces, to achieve the unity and peace of the country today. Although this is the price paid by the martyrs' necks and the comrades' hot blood, the sympathy and acceptance of our Party's ideology by the authorities and people in the Northeast and their participation in the national revolution are also indelible achievements in history. However, looking at the current situation in China, there are still imperialists outside who are watching and have not given up their policy of aggression, and various reactionary elements inside are eager to move and try to undermine the unity and peace of the country. In order to fulfill our responsibilities (the responsibility of saving and building the country), we can only unite the revolutionary people of the whole country and continue to work hard under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang. Therefore, I am specifically proposing this topic of the mission of the Chinese Kuomintang today.</p>
<p>When our Party first started the revolution, many comrades in the Northeast participated. The completion of the unification in the 17th year was due to the assistance of Deputy Commander Zhang and other officers and the support of the people in the Northeast. The Party Department was established long ago. Why has it been delayed until now and is still under preparation? Initially, it was delayed until now because of the Soviet Russian invasion of the border and the subsequent Feng Yuxiang joint rebellion. Now that the order of the national border has been restored and Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang have been defeated, the establishment of the Party Department is imminent under the unanimous and enthusiastic support of the Party's governance by the officials and people in the Northeast. It is also a necessary to have this opportunity to talk to you about the mission of the Party before the Party Department officially starts working, even if it is a timely event.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Kuomintang has assumed the mission of saving and building the country, its nature is clearly different from that of ordinary political parties. Ordinary political parties are mostly divided by class. They stand on the trenches of common interests and unite to realize the interests of their same class. Their political propositions are naturally one-sided, such as the Minseito and Seiyukai in Japan, the proletarian parties, the Conservative Party and Social Democratic Party in Germany, and the Labor Party and Conservative Party in England. The Chinese Kuomintang is a revolutionary party that seeks liberation and freedom for 400 million people. Because the entire Chinese nation is under the oppression and aggression of imperialism, there is only great poverty and small poverty in economics, and there is no class distinction. In terms of occupation, there are only scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants, and there is no distinction between noble and humble. Its revolutionary movement is to unite the awakened members of various occupations to lead the people of various occupations to attack the enemy under the same ideology. In other words, the Chinese Kuomintang is not a party that represents a certain class, but a party that seeks welfare for 400 million people. Looking around at the phenomenon of China and the trend of the world, only the Chinese Kuomintang can shoulder the responsibility of saving and building the country. At the same time, the people of the whole country should actively support our Party in fulfilling its obligation to save and build the country and seek the welfare of the entire Chinese nation.

<h3>Soviet Russia's Plot to Seize Manchuria and Mongolia Intensifies</h3>
<p>Striving to Grasp the Economic Rights of Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>Appropriately Forms a Confrontational Situation with the Japanese</p>
<p>World News Agency, Harbin: In order to realize its five-year plan, Soviet Russia intends to turn the port of Vladivostok into the largest commercial port in the Far East. At the beginning of this month, representatives from the Ussuri River, the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Heilongjiang Russian Commercial Company, and various regions on the border met with representatives from the Soviet Union's Transportation Committee in Vladivostok. As a result of the agreement, a construction plan was decided. The scale of the plan is quite large, and it was decided to expand the current land and water transportation agencies, increase motor vehicle roads and light railways on the border, and build a double track for the Siberian Railway. In addition, air stations will be set up in various important commercial ports in the Far East to realize a scheduled aviation plan. Trade companies will be increased in various places in Northern Manchuria in order to absorb the products of the Northern Manchurian area and grasp the economic hegemony of Northern Manchuria in order to implement its redification plan. In Outer Mongolia, it is also planned to set up new trade companies. The Trade Committee of the Far Eastern government has sent investigators to Eastern Mongolia. Soviet Russia's plan to seize Manchuria and Mongolia appropriately forms a confrontational situation with the Japanese forces.</p>

On the 11th, the steamboat departed from Qingyang Port and headed towards Changshu. Upon reaching the east gate of Kunshan, two patrol boats of the County Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Camp also wanted to return to Changshu and requested to be towed by the steamboat. Unexpectedly, shortly after passing Yangcheng Lake, the steamboat increased its speed, and the steersman on the towed boat was momentarily inattentive, causing one of the patrol boats at the rear to suddenly overturn. All the patrolmen on board fell into the water. The sailors immediately stopped the engine and rescued those who had fallen into the water.

The other day, Aijin was found to be working poorly and taking a Hengsi cone. The foreman, Wang Xiuying, reported this to the factory's work examination director, Mr. Tan, who summoned Aijin and scolded her. Aijin not only did not repent but also incited the female workers in the section to deal with the factory using "employee welfare" tactics. The female workers believed her and stopped working. After foreman Wang Xiuying reported the information to the factory, the factory dismissed Ni Aijin, the female worker who started the trouble. Aijin then became angry with foreman Wang Xiuying and told her husband, Shen Aijin, to summon several younger brothers to wait near the small wooden bridge near the factory. When Wang Xiuying left work, she was grabbed by Shen Aquan and his wife, and without asking any questions, they punched her, causing Xiuying to be seriously injured. The local police then arrested the perpetrator, Ni Aijin, and detained her in the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau to await transfer to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Preliminary Construction of the Eastern Great Port: The surveying and planning of the Eastern Great Port site have been completed and are being implemented. The initial construction plan will first establish four major institutions to divide the work and assist each other: (1) The Eastern Great Port Land Clearing Committee; (2) The Eastern Great Port Seawall Engineering Office; (3) The Eastern Gorge Railway Engineering Office; (4) The Eastern Great Port Bank. These will be established sequentially within this year, and then the construction and dredging projects will be implemented. To proceed, the breakwater from Zhapu to Ganpu will be divided into sections for specialized work because the harbor’s surface is too deep. The bandit suppression department of the four counties has been abolished. The provincial government decided to establish the Xin, Sheng, Feng, and Tai Bandit Suppression Command of Zhejiang Province, with a deadline of one month to eliminate bandits. The deadline expired last month. Subsequently, the people of each county telegraphed, requesting an extension of time to thoroughly eliminate the bandits. The provincial government approved an extension of one month. The bandit gangs surrendered their weapons. The bandit leader Fei Xiangfu and others also led their followers to surrender. The bandit problem has been fundamentally resolved, so the bandit suppression command was declared abolished. The unfinished matters were reported to the provincial government and handed over to the local military police for handling.</p>

<p>The River Embankment Was Damaged by Spring Tides: Recently, the spring tides have been rising, and the embankment in the Yujiatan area of Sixing is in imminent danger. From the 7th to the 11th, the afternoon tides were even stronger. Every day at 1:30 PM, the southern tides rushed in like a stampede, directly hitting the seawall. As a result, tens of acres of mulberry fields suddenly collapsed and sank to the bottom of the sea at the Xixing shoreline. In addition, several sections of the embankment opposite Changhe have sunk. If repairs are not carried out promptly, the spring winds and summer rains, combined with the water from the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, will directly hit the embankment, which will be in an even more precarious state.</p>

Therefore, I do not fear being tedious and will record what I saw on that day as follows:</p>
<p>I went at 8:00 AM. On the way, those attending the meeting came in an endless stream. Military police lined up at the gate to maintain order. The newly built white archway-style was very majestic, made of cotton strips. The thirteen characters "Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the Suppression of Rebellion" were affixed to the archway, surrounded by paper flowers about three zhang high, directly reaching the clouds and attracting attention. A registration desk was set up inside the gate, staffed by personnel to manage registration. After signing in, each person was given a five-inch wide black gauze strip and a pin, which they immediately wrapped around their left arm. Large slogans, two chi wide and three chi long, were posted on the surrounding walls, saying: "To commemorate the fallen soldiers is to continue the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs," "To eradicate the Communist Party," "To realize the Three Principles of the People." The auditorium was built in the middle of the field, with three platforms covered with reed mats and bright tiles, decorated with white lanterns. The middle platform was the altar, the left was the military band platform of the Garrison Headquarters, and the right was the military band platform of the Public Security Bureau. On the altar was a table covered with a white blanket, on which were enshrined two spirit tablets, each three chi five cun high, both inscribed with the eleven characters "Tablets for the Fallen Soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the Suppression of Rebellion." One was made of wood, painted blue with white characters, and the other was made of white cloth with black characters. In front of the spirit tablets were offerings of tea and rice, each in a bowl, eight dishes, and eight plates, along with four types of fruit in tall-footed basins. In the center of the altar was an incense burner with rising incense, and two vases and a flower basket presented by Commander Xiong were placed beside it. There were many flower wreaths presented by the chiefs of staff, adjutants, military law, and quartermaster departments of the Garrison Headquarters. Hundreds of elegiac couplets were hung on the platform, only thirteen of which were displayed due to space constraints. The rest were hung in the field. I have extracted a few of the couplets below: "Battling to establish China, their heroic achievements will remain for eternity in the clouds. Summoning their souls to Shanghai, their glorious deeds will be recorded in the history books for a hundred years." Presented by the Municipal Government. "How many heads were exchanged for the unification of China. An unprecedented campaign won the devotion of the nation's elite." Presented by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. "Heroes are not forgotten, though their lives are lost. Though there be tigers and leopards on land, dragons and crocodiles in the sea, and owls in the sky, with shared hatred and common enmity, it is not difficult to pacify the universe. Since ancient times, all men must die. Let scholars be content with studying the classics, merchants be content with trading, and farmers be content with tilling their fields. Let us commemorate their achievements and honor their virtues, and they shall be worshipped for thousands of years." Presented by the Municipal Education Bureau. "The military, police, and students attended in the largest numbers, standing in front of the platform. The soldiers were in yellow uniforms, the police officers in black wool uniforms, and the students in blue cloth school uniforms, all looking neat and energetic." Mayor Zhang and Chief of Staff Xu Jinyuan stood side by side on the platform. During the public memorial service, thirty-three gun salutes were fired by the artillery team, with three artillery vehicles lined up in the east of the field, firing in sequence, their sounds shaking the roofs. Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau gave a speech, using building a house as an analogy, saying that the fallen soldiers had sacrificed their lives to create the foundation of unification, and future construction relied entirely on the comrades who had not died, followed by a speech by Chief of Staff Xu and a report by an officer of the 27th Group Army. By the time the meeting was dismissed, the clock had struck ten. Along the way, schools still continued to march to pay their respects, truly an unprecedented and unrepeatable grand occasion.</p>
<h3>A Clever Seasonal Couplet</h3>
<p>— Liu Jianzhong</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Ruyu is skilled in poetry and painting, and is an upright and unconstrained figure, a prominent person in the literary and artistic circles of the capital. In the year of Yichou, when I served in Beiping, I benefited from his teachings. I still remember a seasonal couplet he wrote for a friend: Last night, with "Major Cold" and "Frost's Descent," the thatched cottage was like "Minor Snow." This morning, with "Grain Rain" and "Spring Equinox," the willow bank was most "Pure Brightness." Readers all praised it. I have specially recorded it to share with readers.</p>
<h3>Recounting the Wonder of Encounters</h3>
<p>— Wang Meiju</p>
<p>I went from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the twelfth day of the second month of the twentieth year to visit my eldest daughter, Yunwen. I returned to Shanghai one day after her Chongyang Festival (Double Ninth Festival). Although the reunion of family and gatherings of friends were very pleasant during these twenty days, there was nothing worth recording. However, what I saw and heard had encounters that were irregular and disparate. I dare to recount their strangeness to tell my fellow writers, as I am also filled with emotion.</p>
<p>▲ Soybean Curd and Shark Fin. My son-in-law, Xu Ziru, was appointed by his superior to investigate cases in Xianju and Huangyan counties. The wind and snow were severe and the journey over land and water was rugged. He will have spent almost a month traveling back and forth. What he described of the customs, daily life, and food and drink of the two counties was shocking to hear. Since it is not within the scope of this topic, I will omit it for now. However, in Xianju, even the most extravagantly wealthy banquets use shark fin and renshen (ginseng) as delicacies. The secret investigation commissioner remained calm and pretended to be a passerby, dining at a certain family's home in the city. The host also knew how to respect guests, and shark fin was served. The secret investigation commissioner picked up his chopsticks, seeing that the soup was like an antique, the shark fin as sparse as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Finely shredded oil tofu was mixed with the shark fin in the chopsticks. Shark fin is inherently a luxurious food, and it is fine to use less or none at all, but since shark fin existed, it has never been heard of being paired with oil tofu. The hierarchy of nobility and baseness is also not to be relied upon. This is the first wonder of encounters.</p>
<p>▲ Solid Ice and Charcoal. The winter of this year was colder than any in the past thirty years. I arrived in Hangzhou and sat in a room. My eldest daughter used a stove and Fenjiu wine to ward off the cold for the old man. A row of water tanks were arranged in front of the window, mostly used to store rainwater. On the twenty-fourth day of the second month, I happened to see a clear sky. Leaning against the eaves, I saw that the solid ice in the tank had not yet melted, and there was something black and long inside. My grandchildren chiseled it out and found a piece of chestnut charcoal. I also do not know when or who threw charcoal into the water and combined it with the ice. Ice and charcoal are incompatible, but there is also a time when they can coexist. This is the second wonder of encounters.</p>
<p>▲ Mandarin Square and Medical Department. My wife's elder brother, Shen Weiwen, resides in Hangzhou's Hou Market Street. I visited him on the twenty-fifth day of the second month and stayed for lunch. His residence was tall, peaceful, deep, and bright. Gold and stone artifacts and books were neatly arranged. The chairs we sat on were all old Qing Dynasty fourth and fifth-rank gold-embroidered mandarin squares, treasured with cotton wadding and used as cushions. Twenty years ago, at the end of the Qing Dynasty, although the official system was corrupt, these gold-embroidered and glorious mandarin squares were only associated with the front and back of the imperial court. Even the buttocks of the autocratic emperor would not deign to disgrace these mandarin squares by sitting on them. Now, a new approach has been adopted, and buttocks are actually sitting on mandarin squares. This is the third wonder of encounters.</p>
<h3>Record of the Rise and Fall of the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Xiulin</p>
<p>Today, the prosperity of the film industry in Hollywood has reached its peak. Some say that the American film business is more widespread than the banking business. This shows its great power. But let us recall the early days of cinema. After Edison invented the movie camera in 1889, it went through many hardships and difficulties and consumed a lot of mental energy and money. The result was only a few hundred to a few thousand pages of continuous action. Art was out of the question, and even entertainment was hard to come by. It was not until many short comedies appeared that the glorious curtain of the film industry was raised. You all remember Mr. Paulou, whose comedic performances were the most powerful force in the film industry at the time.</p>
<p>Short comedies have after all lost their central position. More interesting and plot-driven films have gradually begun to emerge. But we also remember that the middle era was tied to many full-length detective agency films. At that time, Miss Bao Lian's fame was far above that of Mary Pickford, and dozens of detective and bandit films shown in succession were indeed warmly welcomed. Although these many people and things have become old news today, there are still a few bright stars shining in today's Hollywood, especially Miss Lula Lipret and Mr. Arthur Duman Yoku. I believe that if someone talks to them about things from fifteen years ago, they would be filled with emotion.</p>
<p>After that, sentimental films replaced detective films and created the beginning of the film industry's period of progress. It was not long ago. Many of the actors at that time are still mostly shining on the screen. Only Miss Nan Xumo'er may have been forgotten by us.</p>
<p>The progress of the film industry in the most recent eight or nine years has been truly astonishing. Now, film has become an all-encompassing enterprise. Moreover, sound film has also been invented, and those scientists are going even further and painstakingly experimenting with stereoscopic film. It is expected that in ten years, this film trend will rise above the political trend.</p>
<p>In China, if we observe the short history of film, it is clear that the progress of our film industry is more miraculous than that of the advanced United States. Our talent, economy, time, and equipment are far inferior to the United States. However, if our achievements are proportional to the years, they are far superior to the United States. This is not boasting; the facts are in front of us. Even if our films in the past were as simple as possible, if you look at how the first American films were, weren't they even simpler?</p>
<p>The ancient costume trend has passed, the martial arts trend has passed, and the gods and monsters trend has passed. Its process is almost the same as that of the United States. Now, it has surprisingly caught up, and sound film has also shown a miraculous success in our film industry. Isn't this a gratifying phenomenon? Recently, a film called "Singer Red Peony" caused a sensation in Shanghai. Not only did Chinese films discover new life, but also the original barriers of foreign films were shaken. If we try to think about the rapid progress of American films by starting from the early positions of Miss Hu Die and Miss Xia Peizhen, the protagonists of "Red Peony," and continuing to their current successes, it's as if we can recall the rapid progress of American films. Wait five more years, and I don't believe that Chinese films cannot surpass foreign films.</p>
<p>Publishing News. "Post-War European and American Social Policy," compiled and translated by Professor Lin Zhongke of Shanghai Fada University. The entire book consists of five volumes, totaling about 200,000 words. The selection of materials is precise and thorough. The first edition of 5,000 copies sold quickly. It is said that there are not many books left. It is distributed by Huadong Bookstore on Fourth Malu in this port.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (382)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Huang Cui Dai Uses Techniques to Preserve Her Youthful Appearance, Confusing Eyebrows. Jin Shi Spreads Rumors of Seeking a Steed with a Thousand Pieces of Gold</p>
<p>It turned out that even though it was relatively cold in the north, those fashionable girls still only wore a spun silk shirt with a thin silk vest underneath, tightly wrapping their breasts. Hua Yuanchun's skin was plump and graceful, with a fleshy beauty. At this moment, after untying the front of the vest, Doctor Pan carefully examined the area on her chest from her neck down, a patch of red extending into her cleavage. He nodded slightly, buttoned up her spun silk shirt, and covered her with the blanket. He said to check her legs next. Sister A Jin then uncovered the blanket below. Hua Lao Liu was wearing long silk stockings, but the tops had already fallen down, and spun silk shorts. Doctor Pan first looked at her calves, then rolled up her shorts a little. He saw patches of red on her snow-white legs as well. Finally, he looked at her throat and saw that there were already quite a few yellow spots. Doctor Pan shook his head and said to Hua Lao Liu, "It's not serious. I'll prescribe some medicine and she can rest for a few days. However, it's not convenient to recover here. It's best to go to a hospital. I'll go outside to write the prescription." As he spoke, he gave Ye Tonghou a meaningful look. The two of them then walked out of the room. Once outside, Doctor Pan told them to quickly fetch a basin of water for washing. On one hand, he said to Ye San, "This is a very serious case of scarlet fever. Quickly send her to the hospital. That disease is contagious. It's best to isolate her from other people. I checked her throat and there are already quite a few ulcers. It's probably been a few days since the onset of the illness, right?" Ye San replied, "I heard it started three days ago and coincided with her menstrual period." Doctor Pan shook his head and said, "The illness is very serious. Third Brother, I advise you to also avoid entering her room as much as possible. First and foremost, quickly send her to the hospital, quickly send her to the hospital." Ye San asked, "Do you know any hospitals?" Doctor Pan thought for a moment and said, "There's a City South Hospital nearby. This is a contagious disease, so each patient needs a single room. The hospital facilities are also quite good. Excluding medicine and surgery costs, a middle-grade room is five yuan per day, I think." Ye San replied, "Alright, then please introduce me to them so we can go to the hospital first thing tomorrow morning. We could have gone tonight, but I'm afraid there won't be anyone available at the hospital to assist us tonight. Secondly, I still have to have a small negotiation with the manager here." Doctor Pan then wrote a few words on his business card as a letter of introduction. He also took out a few pills from his large medicine bag and wrote a prescription for them to get gargle medicine. Then he left on his own. Ye Tonghou had no choice but to discuss it with Sister A Jin. They didn't understand what scarlet fever was. Ye San only said that Sixth Miss was suffering from a type of throat inflammation. Doctor Pan said it was very serious. We discussed sending her to the hospital, first because this illness is contagious and there are many people in the troupe here, and it wouldn't be good if it spread to others. Secondly, there will be nurses to take care of her in the hospital, which is better than being here."</p>

<h3>Gold Price Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>The market is still extremely chaotic. Yesterday, March 13th, the gold price showed a slight decline, but the market situation remained extremely chaotic. Suddenly, there was a fluctuation of ten taels. The fierce storms were ultimately unstoppable. In the early market, it almost reached twenty taels. Looking back, trading among colleagues was quite active. Companies such as Zih Feng, Bing Yuanheng, Hengxing Yuancheng, and Fengyong all bought in, while Yuan Maoyong, Xinyi Hengqianchangyi, and others mostly sold. The exchange rate was stable, and the listed price did not change. Overseas silver markets all fell, but the United States was still watching, so the market was flat. The trend of gold prices reversed and fell, and the sellers did not relent. Soon after, it broke 700 taels. Afterwards, the exchange rate improved, especially in Dalian, with Zih Feng, Yongcheng, Fengyong, Hengxing, etc., all vying to buy, so the price soared and surged by more than ten taels, suddenly breaking through 715 taels. At noon, it returned to peace and fell by six or seven taels. In the later market, there was also a difference of fourteen or five taels. The initial momentum waned, and the treasuries of various counties differed. The final count was over 700 taels. The exchange rate eased further. In short, people's minds were unusually uneasy and in a precarious environment. This morning's forecast for large bars is slightly higher.</p>
<p>A period of excitement midway. The April opening this morning immediately fell by four taels and five qian to 703 taels and a half. This was because although the large bars were down a quarter, the silver price fell by five-eighths and was not affected. However, private telegrams only slightly went down by one-eighth. Then, Xinyi Yiyu and others still had selling intentions and continued to drop by six or seven taels, suddenly to 697 taels, and with Mitsui and others selling April British gold at 13875, the banks did 875 with each other, and Hengxing Yuancheng Fengyong and others chased in, jumping up by as much as thirteen taels. The announcement was first made at 710 taels, and the listed price did not change. However, the internal market looked good, and Mitsubishi Datong and others ate up April and May at 8125, and soon there was a rotation of two or three taels, from zero seven taels to zero nine taels and a half. However, Zih Feng, Yong Wanxing, and others all sold, so it fell by six taels, reaching zero three taels and five qian at ten o'clock. After that, the Dalian gang sold Dalian tickets, and each firm sold British gold to cash back receipts, which Anda, Shanghai, and others ate up May 1/3 125 to July Mitsui ate existing Dalian at one tael five qian four qian five, so the gold price rose again. Zih Feng, Yong Da Decheng, Hengxing Yuan, Yuanheng, etc., came in one after another. By half past ten, it had escaped 710 taels, and Hengxing Shunli and others continued to enter, especially Mitsui eating up British gold at qian 375 to 625, so the market atmosphere was quite sharp. Until eleven o'clock and a quarter, it had continued to sixteen taels and five qian. Afterwards, it seemed that downstream Tong Taichang, Da Decheng, Yuan Maoyong, Yong and various firms all had a hand in selling, and the long positions took the opportunity to spit out, so it plummeted by six or seven taels. Around noon, it was calculated at 709 taels and five qian to close the market. After entering, it was done to ten taels or so. The announced price was still calculated at 759 taels, with a pinch of about fifty taels.</p>
<p>The early momentum of the later market waned. The opening in the afternoon immediately rose by three or four taels, calculated at thirteen taels and five qian. It was the remaining momentum after the noon close, and the goods had also opened high. However, Taixing Yuan Maoyong and others all sold, and it immediately fell back by four taels to 09 taels and a half. In a moment, Zih Feng Yong Qian Changxiang and Changhuo Chang and others bought in, and Sumitomo ate April British gold at 6875, so at two thirty it was again thirteen taels and five qian. People traded, and by Xingyuan Tong Taichang and others went on the market to sell. In an instant, the wind was tight and the waves were high, and it plummeted by nine taels to 04 taels and a half at ten minutes past three. Zih Feng Yong and others slightly entered, and then pulled up three taels or so to 08 taels. After three thirty, Hengxing Shengda Bingxing and others all sold, especially because British gold Huabi and others bought eight one two five, and then had to buy eight seven five, so the market was in a state of fatigue, and it gradually went down, losing more than ten taels. After four o'clock, it broke 700 taels, and then fell to 698 taels and five qian. The table and the offering were greater than the demand, and the Indian exchange rate still reported a large Anna. At that moment, retail investors and others bought in and improved by four taels, calculated at 02 taels and five qian. By the time the market closed at four thirty, it was calculated at 701 taels and five qian, a further drop of six taels and five qian compared to the previous day. The highest price of the day was sixteen taels and five qian, and the lowest price was 697 taels, a difference of nineteen taels and five qian. The goods opened at 04 taels in the early market, closed at 09 taels and a half at noon, and closed at twelve taels and two qian in the afternoon at 700 taels. The announced price was calculated at a pinch of forty-five or six taels to fifty-six or seven taels. Dengzhen March 703 taels, April 710 taels, make-up water 703 taels, afternoon 695 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions in the industry are frequent. Among the transactions among colleagues, Hengxing Yuanheng Zih Feng Yong Yu Da Wanxing Chen Fengyong Shunli and others all bought in. Yuan Maoyong Tong Taichang Da Decheng Qian Changxiang Xinyi Heng Yuan Tai, etc., all sold more than they bought. Fuchang Yuhe Futai Heng Yuancheng Fuyu, etc., had frequent entries and exits. In the afternoon, Yuan Maoyong Zih Feng Yong Da Decheng, etc., first went out and then entered. Qian Changxiang Futai Heng Yu had occasional entries and exits. Yuanheng Shunli Fuchang Wanxing all entered. Hengxing Yuan Hengxing Taixing Yuan Tai Nei Xing Tong Taichang all went out. The Dalian gang sought more than they supplied, buying four thousand five or six hundred strips but selling one thousand three or four hundred strips. The Guangdong gang first entered and then went out, but not much. Speculator Lu first entered and then went out.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Trends Easing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets saw further declines. However, the market situation was calm, so the Shanghai market was not affected. The HSBC listed price for each exchange rate was the same as after the afternoon change on the previous day. However, the trend of the internal market of banks was easing, starting to weaken from the morning. The gold market opened low and then suddenly turned upwards, so it also appeared tight. The afternoon situation was inferior, and then the gold price retreated to within 700 taels. As a result, each exchange rate compared to the previous day: British gold increased by 1875, American gold increased by 375, and Japanese gold fell by one and a half points.

All banks were still quite lonely in doing it all day. There were few entries and exits for American gold, and the Dalian gang threw out tens of thousands of yuan in Dalian tickets, which Sumitomo and Mitsui bought. However, each gold firm had very few transactions, because the hedging was not suitable.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Remains Bullish</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still firm, but actual sales are unusually light. At this prosperous time of spring, there is great hope for development. Because the price is too high, it hinders sales, and most gangs implemented unified affairs last year, absorbing a large amount. It is said that most of the existing yarn is transferred to various stations and has not yet been cleared. Therefore, at present, each gang has no office stomach, and the survey shows that daily transactions on the market are 80% or 90% of Japanese yarn, so the yarn accumulates more and more thickly. This situation is very bad, so most people outside the industry tend to sell. However, a certain merchant's heart is still strong and continues to buy and increase the code. What the future is depends on the actual needs.</p>
<p>The recent most beautiful human standard. The opening of the human standard in the early market was due to the rise in American cotton and the slightly higher gold price, making the popularity especially tight and the buying atmosphere more intense. Large households bought near-month up two taels and four qian, and far up one tael and three or four qian. The opening of the standard yarn in the afternoon market was still high. At the closing, the gold market fell again, and the near-month rose five or six qian, and the far-month fell nine qian to one tael. The statistics show that 36,450 bales were traded throughout the day. Yu Da sold 1,350 bales, He Shen 900 bales, Tongxing 900 bales, Feng 1,550 bales, Yongfeng 700 bales, Meiji bought 1,000 bales, Changfeng 2,700 bales, and Xincheng 1,300 bales.

The survey shows that each gang bought a total of 530 bales. Colleagues entered 450 bales. Among the customer gangs, Shantou entered 90 bales, inland entered 140 bales, Sichuan entered 110 bales, Guangdong entered 20 bales, Fujian entered 20 bales, Hong Kong entered 100 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 50 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Morning High and Noon Bottom</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell at noon. American cotton rose slightly and Indian cotton tended to fall, making the situation more moderate, so people's hearts were calm. However, the buying attitude was still strong. Only one part saw the general trend softening, and the long-mindedness became increasingly dim. One part tended to short, but the gold price suddenly rose and fell, making it difficult to capture. The cotton market rose and fell indefinitely. The measurement of the situation is relatively soft.</p>
<p>The Han standard is slightly flat. The opening of the Han standard in the early market was due to the difficulty of the rise in American cotton and the trend of the fall in Indian cotton, making people's hearts calm. Each fell five or six qian. The two or three plates were due to the ups and downs of the gold price, making people's hearts suddenly tight. As a result, each rose four six eight nine qian. The atmosphere in the afternoon market suddenly loosened because there were large households with long positions closing, and each fell four five six seven qian. The statistics show that 83,400 dan were traded throughout the day. Jin Feng sold 2,700 dan, Tongxing 5,300 dan, Zhengda 1,500 dan, Gongtai 1,800 dan, Shenchang 1,500 dan, Changji bought 2,000 dan, Gengfeng 3,200 dan, Changfeng 4,700 dan, and Tianlong 1,700 dan.

<h3>American Cotton and the Three Products Follow the Same Path to Prosperity</h3>
<p>Britain and India still have no development.</p>
<p>American cotton has a counter-trend purchase. Yesterday, American cotton was tired at first due to foreign merchants selling, and then firm due to industry purchases and counter-trend purchases. It is estimated that futures rose six to five pounds, and spot rose ten pounds. British cotton futures fell six or seven points, spot fell nine points, Egyptian cotton spot fell twenty points. Indian cotton first fell slightly with American cotton, and then the market became softer due to European exporters and the public selling. It is estimated that the near and far term of Pingguoer fell four rupees. The near and far term of Aomula and Bairoxi both fell five rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (12th telegram).</p>

<h3>Grain Customer Yuan Sales Still Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer indica market situation: customer transformation was even more sluggish. Stored households, hearing that foreign rice from Hong Kong and Korea was coming to Shen, did not dare to do as much as possible. The unified market was only handled by this street, and 103 bags of Nanjing rice were priced at 8 yuan 7 jiao, and the price was also slightly softer. There were no other transactions. The market only had Jiangxi late rice and other numbers were not many. Jiangxi gang will not be able to transport after, and they insist on not selling. But even if they are willing to sell, except for stored households, they all dislike the high price and do not handle it. However, the sales of customer yuan are still good, and all customers have a stomach, but the storage is lacking and high goods are especially few. Yesterday, only the Shantou gang handled 400 bags of Jiangxi Zhongguan Ji Yuan at a price of 11 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Trend Not Good</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the market in each month once saw a stable and pretty state. Because the gold price rebounded and the quotation of foreign wheat was also better by one jiao, the opening price in each recent month seemed to be better than the closing price on Wednesday by one fen. However, the factory side continued to order foreign wheat, and all of the Longevity codes had a basis, so they still tended to sell. The long position of the inland gang also turned to the decline of the wheat seedlings walking towards prosperity, so people's hearts turned lonely, and there were also many people engaged in the end. Therefore, each month also saw softness. In the afternoon, the market situation was roughly swirling, but the trend was still good. According to the speculation of general non-people, it is estimated that the far-term will be low to the two taels level, and can be temporarily stopped. As a result, this month fell by one fen compared to Monday, April and May fell by five fen, June and July fell by two and a half li, and August fell by five li.</p>
<h3>Term Wheat Initially Firm and Then Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's term wheat market: the market in each month showed an initial firm and then fatigue situation after opening in the afternoon. In the early morning, the initial opening was still stable because the gold price rebounded and people's hearts were still stable. However, after the two plates, the industry's short selling was still smooth, and the inland gang's long position was also due to the goodness of the weather. The farmer's thinking was not as tough as before, and the sale of new wheat in the far term was smooth, so the degree of decline in each far term month was even greater than that in the near term. As a result, this month fell by two fen compared to Wednesday, April fell by two fen, May fell by one fen, June, July and August fell by five fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Slag Ice Opened Down 14 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday's refined market production area telegram: the price of existing Cuban sugar was slightly down ○0625 compared to the previous telegram. The New York term sugar for May returned down one fen, the term for December fell by more than two fen, and the terms for the remaining months and existing Javan sugar had no rise or fall. The association market's plate allocation of 24 Dutch sugar The white sand outside the door increased its foreign exchange and slightly tightened, but the actual sales were sluggish and the buying was quiet. In the later market, there was a slight entry and exit of 10 taels and 03 qian. There was even less inquiry about medium white sand. The silence of the market situation was really rare. The Japan sugar transaction was also sparse, and the market image has seen peace. Mark YP mark 10 taels 05 qian YT mark 10 taels 03 qian YRO mark 9 taels 9 qian half SH mark 10 taels 005 fen. The entry and exit were very loose. The Hao plate had Yuanlai Hao opening existing goods 3 slag ice bags at a price of 14 taels, and the receiver was not prosperous and the market image was still firm.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Honey Dates Market Price Daily Tight</h3>
<p>The price of honey dates is increasing daily due to the thin bottom of the land storage. Therefore, since last month, the Shanghai market has also tightened. If the top emblem worker is bald, the previous plate had opened 32 or 33 taels, and the market sold and called 35 taels yesterday. Such as Lan's bald, it also needs more than 30 taels. The high and low grades still add back the market image as usual, and it seems difficult to trend loose.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Silk Factory Stagnation Continues to Show Firm and Pretty</h3>
<p>The various silk factories in this and foreign cities, due to the operating losses of last year, have no power to resume operations. They are now quietly waiting for the government to issue silk industry bonds to help them. The number of silk factories starting up is less than one in five. The silk factory's backlog production is greatly reduced, and the domestic and foreign sales are smooth, and the supply is not enough. The market price is becoming more firm. Yesterday's Wuxi silk factory backlog had already opened 38 taels, and there was still a lack of a large amount of supply.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei French Sales Turn Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the French Moroccan market of Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi, Shexian and other roads started the spring sales. Yihuo, Tongfu, Fushi and other companies have received demand telegrams for several days, and the market situation has turned smooth. The city traded more than 1,300 boxes at a price of 52 or 3 taels. Yongxing Foreign Firm also slightly improved the stomach for needle eyebrows, show eyebrows and other items. The selling plate was unchanged from the previous day. However, the existing bottom of the Gongxi item was no longer seen more. There were also no transactions in the city yesterday.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Opening Price Chaotic State</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth of this factory has fluctuated up and down for several days, which is very difficult to grasp. The reason is that the gold market is unpredictable and the customer gang is suddenly fitted and stopped, so the market price changes with it. Yesterday, the trend of fine cloth can be sustained, and the broker is again searching for it. The Niuzhuang Tianjin two gangs also have purchases, so they all rose together by about one qian. There is not much good fine twill. Yanghe has returned to three qian nine pounds. Because there are more existing goods of coarse cloth, it fell by five fen to thirteen pounds yesterday. One of the bull heads and Niuzhuang gangs traded more than one hundred pieces at a price of six taels zero five fen. Because there is not much cargo of sixteen pounds, it is still firm. 84 raw cloth slightly fell. The coarse twill is still the most hard to realize at three yuan per person tower. Yihuo bleached cloth Jin Santala is sold at nine taels two qian half.</p>
<p>The market for Eastern and Western piece goods has been lifeless recently, and the actual sales are waiting and seeing. It is difficult to invigorate the cargo price for a while, and people's hearts are very empty. Although</p>

<p>Sun Ke Speaks</p>
<h3>### The Difficulties of Raising Prices on Two Railways</h3>
<p>Revenue and expenditure cannot offset the huge deficit. Sun plans to return to Guangdong to visit his family soon. Railway Minister Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:00 AM on the overnight express train from Nanjing. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Mayor Zhang Qun made a special visit to Sun's residence to report on the progress of the election of National Assembly representatives in Shanghai. He left around 4:00 PM. This newspaper's reporter interviewed Sun yesterday, and according to Sun, the preparations for the National Assembly are being actively carried out. "I have not returned to my ancestral home in Zhongshan, Guangdong for two years. I have been thinking about taking some time off soon for about two weeks to visit Tang Shaoyi and inspect the construction of Zhongshan County. However, the date has not yet been determined."</p>
<h3>Zhongshan Port Construction</h3>
<p>Sun also said that regarding the issue of opening Zhongshan Port, he is currently entrusting a Dutch company to send engineers to Guangdong to conduct on-site surveys. After a comprehensive report is available, a public comparison of the advantages and disadvantages with the construction of Huangpu Port will be made to determine the standards for constructing the river port. In terms of construction costs, Zhongshan Port seems to be slightly more economical than Huangpu Port.</p>
<h3>Haas's Report</h3>
<p>The three ministers of the League of Nations, Economy, Transportation, and Health, have come to China at the invitation of the National Government to propose improvement plans. Transportation Minister Haas and I have met repeatedly. His contributions focus on the Huai River diversion project and various water conservancy and transportation projects. Because he has not been in China for long, there are still many gaps in understanding, and he has not been able to express specific opinions. In the future, he may plan to go north to inspect and investigate thoroughly before submitting a comprehensive report for the National Government's reference.</p>
<h3>Price Increase on Two Railways</h3>
<p>Regarding the increase in fares on the Nanjing-Shanghai and Hangzhou-Shanghai railways, Sun said that the Railway Department does indeed have its own unavoidable difficulties. The total revenue of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway last year was 13 million yuan, but the second installment of the principal of the bonds due last year has not yet been paid. In addition, the third installment of the principal due this year totals about 5 million yuan. At the same time, the accumulated arrears for the purchase of locomotives, trains, and materials last year are about 2 million yuan. Adding the interest payable and various repair costs, the total is about 10 million yuan. The annual recurring expenditure is 13 million yuan, so the total expenditure for this year is 23 million yuan. After the fare increase, it is estimated that the annual revenue can be increased by 2.6 million yuan, so the total revenue for this year is only slightly over 15 million yuan. The amount of the deficit between revenue and expenditure is still huge, and it is impossible not to rectify and find other ways.</p>
<h3>Requisitioned Trains Returned</h3>
<p>The reporter then inquired whether the requisitioned trains by various military factions have actually been returned. Sun said that the requisitioned trains by various military factions have indeed been returned one after another. Only a small portion remains with Shi Yousan's troops, and the rest are only temporary and sporadic borrowings, which are not of great importance. Finally, when asked about Hu Hanmin's condition, he replied that he is recovering day by day.</p>
<h3>Sino-German Eurasia Aviation Company's Test Flight Yesterday</h3>
<p>Non-stop Flight for Two Hours, Results Still Good. The four Junkers aircraft purchased by the Sino-German Eurasia Aviation Company in Germany and shipped to Shanghai have recently had two FI8 aircraft assembled. A short test flight was conducted on the same day. Another test flight was conducted yesterday, with a longer non-stop flight time. The details of yesterday's situation are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Test Flight Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, the German pilot Kilotz, accompanied by radio operator Splin Frohrenz, etc., drove the WI8 aircraft and slowly took off from one end of the Hongqiao Airport. Then, it quickly ascended, the sound of the engine resonating in the air above the airport for about half an hour. It then circled Shanghai several times before descending at 2:30 PM. The non-stop flight time in the air was about two hours.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The attendees at the test flight included representatives from the German Lufthansa Company, the director of the company's aviation department, Mr. Schmidt, a representative from the Junkers Company, Mr. Hoen, the secretary of the Sino-German Eurasia Aviation Company, Mr. Shen Yani, the architectural engineer, Mr. Liang Mutang, the Shanghai station director, Mr. Yang Qingde, pilots, technicians, and representatives from the three petroleum companies, Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco, totaling more than twenty people.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Fuselage</h3>
<p>The entire fuselage is made of light gray metal, which is shorter and smaller than the aircraft operated by the China National Aviation Corporation in Shanghai. It is specially equipped for land use. The aircraft is equipped with a radio. The front is the pilot's seat and the radio operator's seat, and the back is the cargo hold. It is said that the other two FI8 aircraft have passenger cabins in the rear and can carry passengers. This aircraft is specially prepared for postal use.</p>
<h3>Test Flight Date</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Shen and Mr. Liang from the company, the Eurasia Company plans to conduct a formal test flight in Shanghai ten days later, inviting people from all walks of life to visit or ride. The exact dates for the test flights to Beijing and Manchuria have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Station Master Appointment</h3>
<p>The domestic route of the Eurasia airline departs from Shanghai, passes through Nanjing, Jinan, and Beijing, and goes to Manchuria. It is said that the Shanghai station master has been appointed as Mr. Yang Qing, the Beijing station master is Zhang Yun, Mr. Zhang used to be a representative stationed in Germany, Nanjing is Jiang Da, and Jinan is internally designated as Mr. Gao, but he has not yet been appointed.</p>
<h3>Postal Charges</h3>
<p>It is said that Eurasia Aviation specializes in transporting international mail, and the payment method is the same as that of Sino-American. The postage is 15 cents for every 1,000 kilometers, and 30 cents for more than 1,000 kilometers. The passenger ticket price has not yet been determined, but it is said to be roughly the same as that of Sino-American. The China National Aviation Corporation has set the ticket price to Beijing at 150 yuan.</p>
<p>Director of the International Telegraph Bureau</p>
<h3>Lu Guixiang Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhong E, Director of the International Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, was transferred to be Director of the Telegraph Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications. The vacancy was filled by Lu Guixiang, Director of the Telegraph Machinery Manufacturing Factory of the Ministry of Communications. Mr. Lu took office at the bureau yesterday afternoon, and the former director transferred the duties one by one. Mr. Lu plans not to change the staff in the bureau. The position of Director of the Telegraph Machinery Manufacturing Factory has been entrusted by the ministry to Yu Runsheng, Director of the Capital Telephone Bureau. However, Mr. Yu has not yet arrived in Shanghai and is expected to be able to complete the transfer tomorrow. Lu is from Songjiang and graduated from the former Beijing Postal and Telegraph School of the Ministry of Communications. He has held important positions in the telegraph administration and was the director of the Wireless Management Office. A few years ago, he went to Europe for inspection and returned to China, and then served as the director of the Telegraph Machinery Manufacturing Factory.</p>
<h3>Continued News of the Burning of the Daji Steamer</h3>
<p>More Than One Hundred Bodies Have Been Recovered. The Daji Steamer, operated by the Dada Company between Shanghai and Yangzhou, was burned after passing through Zhanghuanggang to Longjusha. Only the hull remained. Many people were burned to death or drowned. As of yesterday afternoon, it was reported that more than one hundred bodies have been recovered from the scene of the accident. The details obtained yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Only the Hull Remains</h3>
<p>The cause of the explosion of the Daji Steamer this time has gradually become clear. It was indeed caused by more than sixty new soldiers of the anti-smuggling camp who boarded the ship from Tianshenggang to Yangzhou and threw lit cigarette butts into the sulfur and gunpowder they were carrying, causing the explosion. Therefore, the explosion occurred in the large cabin next to the chimney, and the explosion went from bottom to top, destroying the middle and upper cabins of the ship. After the explosion, the entire ship was filled with black smoke and sparks, and all the passengers who were not killed by the explosion jumped into the Yangtze River. This was the actual situation at the time. The passenger cabins and various constructions above the ship's cabin that were not blown away caught fire and burned. At this time, there was no one to put out the fire, so it was allowed to burn. The bow and stern of the ship were relatively intact. By yesterday, only the hull remained.</p>
<h3>All Cargo Burned</h3>
<p>The cargo shipped from Shanghai this time included sugar, soybeans, paper, soybean oil, and miscellaneous foreign goods, totaling more than 1,000 pieces. Only two pieces of cloth were shipped. After the ship was blown up, the cargo in the large cabin, due to the presence of paper, oil, soybeans, and other flammable items, also spread and caught fire. The rescue ships were busy rescuing people who had fallen into the water and had no time to take care of the ship. According to reliable information obtained by the bureau yesterday, the cargo in each cabin has been completely burned, leaving nothing behind. It is estimated that the loss of the destroyed cargo is about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Longda Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Zhengda Steamer of the Datong Company carried more than twenty rescued crew members and passengers the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the company's Longda arrived in Shanghai. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency went to the ship to inquire and learned that when Longda passed Xinkang, it was night. A small boat brought six refugees, but one of the six was the owner of the Daji Steamer, Wu Shifang, one was the chief mate, Xu Zifang, one was the second mate, Tang Mengchao, and the rest were the stoker Wang Afu, Ah Si, Mei Shao, etc. Wang Afu had burns on his neck and was immediately sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by the company.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Dead</h3>
<p>Later, according to the crew member who took the Longda Steamer back to Shanghai, the Guowen News Agency reporter said that the number of people who were forced to die in the water and fire this time was truly shocking. Crew members who suffered this disaster accounted for 40%. As for other passengers, they were even more insignificant. It was truly a rare and strange disaster. According to what I (the crew member) know, there are already 136 or 137 foreign sails that have been recovered by ships passing through Zhanghuanggang and placed there. The Tongzhou Dada Branch and the local fellow villagers association will prepare coffins and collect the bodies. As for those who were burned in the ship and sunk in the river, I am afraid there are not a few. Most of the travelers who go out have a lot of silver dollars with them. They are not good at swimming and regard money as their lives, so they sink to the bottom of the river and it takes a considerable amount of time to float up. In addition to the new soldiers who were killed on the spot by the explosion, there were not many who escaped. The number of passengers who died must be investigated after the embers are extinguished.</p>
<h3>Registration of Victims</h3>
<p>The passengers carried by the Zhuanxiu Dahe and Zhengda steamers to Shanghai the day before yesterday were all arranged by the company to stay at the Tongru Chonghai Fellow Villagers Association at the Dada Wharf in Nanshi. Yesterday afternoon, the association registered the families of the victims, intending to find out their names and then telegram the Tongzhou Fellow Villagers Association to visit and investigate nearby. The list of missing persons who have registered is as follows:</p>
<p>Passengers registered, hometown, number of missing family members: Zhu Guilin, Yangzhou, wife Zhu Yangshi, 1 person; Zhu Yongzhi, Gaoyou, aunt's grandson Qing, 1 person; Wang Zhangshi, also aunt's niece, Dada's granddaughter, 2 people; Ah Hong, Zhang Wushi, also daughter-in-law Zhang Nishi, husband Zhang Faqi, 2 people; Shi Dehe, also brother-in-law Li Guangqia, 1 person; Jiang Ruchun, Yancheng, son Qilin, neighbor Gao Genxiang, 3 people; Jiang Caixi, Gu Shixiang, Gaoyou, younger brother Shifu, 1 person; Zhang Ceao, Taizhou, younger brother Kunao, 1 person; Cao Shengcha, also son-in-law Li Xiaoli, father Changhai, 1 person; Huan Caixi, Yangzhou, neighbors Han Yusheng, Shi Laiju, 3 people; Gong Guilin, Taizhou, brother-in-law Chen Xiqing, 1 person; Shu Chenshi, Xinghua, father Chen Yunshou, husband Shu Long, 3 people; Hua Shu, Chen Guilan, Jiang Yutian, Gaoyou, brother Yushan, 1 person; Xiong Youyu, Taizhou, wife Xiong Wangshi, nephew Zhang, 2 people; Ruyi, Ge Runzhou, Gaoyou, wife Wan Xushi, 1 person; Wang Zhan'ao, Huaian, cousin Luo Jinsheng, son Dakou, 4 people; neighbor An Hucheng, Ding San, Xue Huaigong, Jiangyin, brother Huaijian, colleague Yang Baoquan, 2 people. As for single passengers and those who did not stay in Shanghai and went to the scene of the accident to investigate, they had already taken the Daqing the night before.</p>
<h3>Soldiers Covering Their Tracks</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reporter asked why none of the more than forty new soldiers who boarded the ship from Tongzhou were rescued among the two hundred survivors. After inquiring among the Longda, Dahe, and other people who encountered the accident, they said that the soldiers were living on top of the gunpowder, and half of them died because of the explosion. Although the others escaped, they all destroyed their symbols, removed their uniforms, and mingled with the passengers to avoid suspicion. Even if they came to Shanghai, they would falsely claim to be passengers and not recognize them as new soldiers. Therefore, in the future, in addition to the dead, it may be possible to find one or two of the soldiers. The survivors may have already fled far away and cannot be found.</p>
<h3>Traces of the Crew</h3>
<p>Many of the crew members of the Daji Steamer also suffered disasters, but according to people who came yesterday, most of them are missing. Among the hundred or so bodies recovered in Zhanghuanggang, there are only four or five people. It is also said that it is necessary for Chu Yuan and Chu Heng to come to Shanghai tomorrow or the day after tomorrow to confirm who the ten or so people are. The names of the crew members who have already reported to the company are listed below: Ship owner Wu Shicai (came), Chief Mate Xu Zicai (came), Second Mate Tang Mengchao (came), Accountant Xu Jingzhai (dead), Box Office Cheng Ziyu (came), Ni Shaofu (came), Stoker Wang Afu (came, injured), Mei Shao (came), Ah Si (came), Cargo Room Wang Fu (came), Meng Dingyuan (not yet), Jin Maoliang (false), Apprentice Hu Youlin (came), Xu Shilou (came), Zhang Guohua (came), Zheng Guobao (came), Xu Zhaocai (came), Deng Xiaohui (came), Li Luohe (came), Shi Rengyun (came), Xiao Sun (came), Wang San (came), Apprentice Qiangzi (came), Sanzi (came), Guan Guotang (came), Jiang Mingcai (came), Tea Room Wang Men (came), Ni Shou (not yet), Tao Yuan (came), Bei Lianfu (not yet), Yao Bingsheng (came), Li Ansheng (came), Xu Yongqing (came), Huang Daoshi (not yet), Mao Ye (came), Wu Chuanfu (dead), Ding Baokui (not yet), Qian Nanshan (not yet), Wang Rencai (not yet), Dou Yongguang (not yet), Wu Genquan (not yet), Zhuang Jinwen (came), Wei Guoliang (came), Ma Biao (came), Fang Xingquan (not yet), Fusheng (came), Watchman Yu Yonghe (not yet), Ah Hui (not yet), Cao San (came), Zhang Gui (came), Zhang Zhen (not yet). The above crew members are not yet complete, but they are recorded to give a glimpse.</p>
<h3>Pier Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the victims in front of the Dada Pier in Nanshi were all led to the Chonghai Fellow Villagers Association for accommodation, so the tragic situation was not as panicked as the day before. However, well-wishers still continued to watch, and it was very crowded. The families of the crew members all came to inquire. Upon hearing of someone's death, they could not help but cry loudly. The reporter saw three women and one girl standing at the pier for almost two hours. They then learned that their husband had died, and they all cried out in resentment, even wanting to throw themselves into the river to die. After being persuaded, they were supported away by the girl. It is said that there is still a child, a family of six, all relying on one person to survive. How tragic!</p>
<h3>Aftermath Measures</h3>
<p>Dada sent Chuyuan the day before yesterday with supplies to provide relief. Yesterday, the company learned that the crew members had been confirmed dead and summoned the families to bring clothes to collect the bodies (taking the Yuandahe upstream last night). Those who have not been verified, yesterday the company sent three telegrams to the Nantong branch, ordering them to prepare coffins and clothes nearby and go to the scene of the accident to collect the bodies. In the future, the coffins of those who are from Jiangnan will be transported back by the company, and those who live in Jiangbei will be handled by the Tongzhou branch in coordination with the local fellow villagers association to provide compensation. Compensation must be started after the bodies have been collected. Therefore, the families of the crew members who had not returned to Shanghai yesterday all took the Dahe, which was leaving for the night, to take care of the funeral. The company provided all the tickets and food. The company also sent Mr. Wang to accompany them, so all matters must be known for sure after the batch of personnel returns.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team's Actions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, they visited the City Hall and other places. They will go to Beijing for sightseeing in ten days. The Chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team on Trafficking in Women and Children in the Far East, American Ms. Johnson, members Swedish Mr. Lindquist, Polish Mr. Pingdao, and Secretary Xuan Meideng, were accompanied by Xiao Jirong, the welcoming commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet Liu Yunfang and Zhang Xinhai, the counselor newly sent to Shanghai by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Then they went to the City Hall to visit Mayor Zhang Qun for a long conversation. It is said that the team will stay in Shanghai for about ten days before going to Beijing for sightseeing and then to Qingdao, Tianjin, Liaoning, and other places for investigation.</p>
<p>League of Nations Economic Minister</p>
<h3>Salter Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Beijing</h3>
<p>Gave a speech at the Economic Society on World Commerce. League of Nations Economic Minister Sir Arthur Salter was invited to Beijing to provide a comprehensive financial reorganization plan and has already met with Finance Minister Song Ziwen once. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing and is still staying at the Cathay Hotel. Last night, he attended the banquet of the Economic Society at the Bankers Association and gave a speech on the decline of world commerce from all angles. Mr. Salter must return to Beijing in a few days.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting and Others Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting, Chen Shaokuan, Cai Yuanpei, and Chang Xingfu all took the overnight train from Beijing yesterday and are expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Zhang Weicheng Requested Leave to Return Home</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will go to Beijing next week. Zhang Weicheng, Consul General stationed in Korea, requested leave to return home due to certain important official matters. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs approved the request by telegram. Zhang will travel south via Liaoning and arrived in Shanghai yesterday, staying at the Wenzhou Hotel on Rue Lafayette in the French Concession. He is scheduled to go to Beijing next week.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui's Injuries Fully Recovered</h3>
<p>The injuries of Xiong Shihui, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, have fully recovered. His body can also move freely, and his appetite is gradually recovering. He also absorbs fresh air in the sunlight every day. However, he still stays in the hospital for recuperation as instructed by the doctor to wait for his complete recovery.</p>
<h3>Shen Fuhai Discusses the Issue of Submarine Cables</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications previously appointed Shen Fuhai, head of the submarine cable section of the International Telegraph Bureau, to go to Qingdao to inspect and evaluate the operations of the Qingdao-Sasebo submarine cable after it was reclaimed. Mr. Shen has returned to Shanghai and discussed the issue of various submarine cables with the reporter of Huadong News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>Qingdao-Sasebo Submarine Cable: Mr. Shen said that the Qingdao-Sasebo Submarine Cable was laid by Germany and seized by Japan during World War I. After repeated negotiations after the war, the cable was jointly owned by China and Japan. The Japanese also used the excuse that China lacked machinery and technicians and set up the Qingdao-Sasebo Submarine Cable Operations Office in Qingdao as an agency. We have now decided to reclaim it, so I went to estimate the price of all the machinery and equipment there as a standard. The date of recovery depends on when the Shanghai-Nagasaki cable and other contracts are fully signed.</p>
<p>Great Northern and Great Eastern Cables: Mr. Shen was previously appointed by the Ministry of Communications as a member of the committee to take over the Great Northern and Great Eastern Cables. The date of the takeover is said to depend on when the details are agreed upon. As for the four telegraph offices of Great Northern, Great Eastern, Pacific, and Shanghai-Nagasaki, the four receiving and dispatching directors appointed by our ministry, Pan, Chen, Sun, and Yu, have gathered in Shanghai. Once the contract is signed, they must go to take over. At that time, the telegraph lines, formats, and telegraphic uniforms of the four bureaus must be the same as those of our country, and they must be hung with the sign of the submarine cable telegraph receiving and dispatching office of the International Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>Recovery of Land Cables: As for those recovered in Tianjin, Tianjin, and Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other places, they are the land cables in our country borrowed by Great Northern and Great Eastern. The contract expired at the end of last year and was extended for six weeks, so it was only recovered a few days ago. At present, telegrams in various places are sent to us by Great Northern and Great Eastern. As for the land cables in Shanghai, they were laid by the two bureaus themselves. One line starts from Baoshan and one line starts from Wusong. The contract stated that it would expire at the end of last year and be recovered by China at no cost. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has started negotiations and plans to recover it according to the agreement.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Yantai-Dagukou Cable: The Shanghai-Yantai-Dagukou submarine cable could have been recovered immediately, but because the price of gold is rising day by day, the repayment of the loan is still expected. Once the loan is repaid, it can be recovered.</p>
<p>Cuban Sugar Industry Representative</p>
<h3>Results of the Investigation of the Chinese Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Will Ship Cuban Sugar to China for Sale. The Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that after the Cuban sugar industry representatives Pilarte and two others came to Shanghai last winter to investigate the Chinese sugar market, the two soon returned home. Pilarte was hospitalized in Shanghai due to pneumonia and only left the hospital a few days ago. It is now said that he still needs to stay for a few weeks before...</p>

<p>New Discoveries in Tuberculosis Treatment</p>
<p>Translated from a German Tuberculosis Sanatorium Magazine</p>
<h3>What is the Tuberculosis Bacterium?</h3>
<p>The tubercle bacillus (i.e., the tuberculosis bacterium) is a rod-shaped bacterium whose body is straight or slightly curved, with a length of about one-millionth of a meter. It cannot be seen with the naked eye. Using a specific method to prepare a stained specimen with heat, it can only be seen under a microscope with a magnification of 600 to 1,000 times. It is indeed an extremely small object.</p>
<p>In ancient times, the Chinese named it "labor cough worm." Nowadays, everyone knows that the tubercle bacillus is the worm of tuberculosis and does not belong to the animal kingdom. There are countless lower microorganisms around us, commonly known as microscopic organisms, that cannot be seen with the naked eye. These microscopic organisms are divided into animal and plant types. Those belonging to the animal type are called protozoa, and those belonging to the plant type are called bacteria. These lower plant molds belong to a family of cryptogams without chlorophyll. Among the bacteria, they are divided into "filamentous bacteria," "budding fungi," and "fission fungi" according to their shape and nature.</p>
<h3>The Colonial Policy of the Tuberculosis Bacterium</h3>
<p>The reproduction of fission fungi is based on the fission of their own bodies, that is, from one to two, from two to four, gradually increasing. Therefore, they are called fission fungi. Humans and other animals often develop diseases because of them, so they are called "pathogenic bacteria." They are also divided into "spherical fungi," "rod-shaped fungi," and "spiral fungi" according to their shape. The tuberculosis bacterium is a rod-shaped bacterium among the fission fungi.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis bacteria are most abundant in the sputum of tuberculosis patients. The amount increases or decreases according to the severity of the patient's illness. According to Dr. Haikeler of Germany, a piece of sputum from a tuberculosis patient contains 300 million tubercle bacilli. Therefore, a person who coughs up sputum once an hour has 720 billion tubercle bacilli discharged from the body of the tuberculosis patient and spread into the air. People in the world are attacked by them day and night. But where do these numerous pathogens come from? The body of the fission fungus has a fission function, as mentioned earlier. It gradually increases and reproduces for this reason. In the beginning, it was originally a single fungus, and later it gradually split from one to two to four, and the force of incremental proliferation gradually expanded. Now, if we assume that the speed of proliferation is once an hour, then within 24 hours, one fungus has become 16 million. From this, the following can be inferred:</p>
<p>(1) How vigorous is the reproductive power of fungi?</p>
<p>(2) Why do countless pathogens occur in the patient's body?</p>
<p>(3) Why does the patient's sputum contain countless tubercle bacilli?</p>
<h3>The Resistance of the Tuberculosis Bacterium</h3>
<p>The resistance of the tubercle bacillus is very strong. Knowing the magnitude of its resistance is most important for tuberculosis prevention and treatment. When the sputum of tuberculosis patients is placed in the air, the survival of the tubercle bacillus can reach more than half a year. When placed in a dark room with a lack of light, it can still survive for more than a year. This fungus has particularly strong resistance to cold. It does not die after six or seven weeks of cold at minus 10 degrees Celsius. It also has stronger resistance to warm heat than other fungi. Other fungi die after two or thirty minutes at a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius, but this fungus must be at a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius for two or thirty minutes to die. However, its resistance to sunlight is the weakest. It dies after five or six minutes of direct sunlight. It dies after one or two minutes of warm heat above 100 degrees Celsius. As for disinfectant, the tubercle bacillus in the sputum of tuberculosis patients dies after 30 seconds in 20 times carbolic acid water, dies after one minute in 100 times carbolic acid water, and dies after ten minutes in 1,000 times mercuric chloride water.</p>
<p>Dr. Eidman of Germany made a physiological X-ray image of the lungs.</p>
<h3>Lung Tuberculosis Germ Dewaxing and Killing Method</h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., lung disease) is the tubercle bacillus. Once this bacterium enters the human body, it forms nodules at that location, blocking the blood circulation. Furthermore, the tubercle bacillus can secrete an acid-resistant wax to surround itself, preventing the intrusion of all external medicinal powers. Therefore, despite the use of various germicidal drugs, whether taken internally or injected, it is ultimately impossible to reach the actual substance of the germ. The traditionally used "Bairen Therapy," symptomatic treatment, physical therapy, serum therapy, drug therapy, and all other treatments by past physicians have not been entirely successful. The saying that there is no cure for lung disease has been prevalent for a generation because people were unaware of this profound scientific principle. Therefore, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the aforementioned scientific principle, continue to research tirelessly. As a result, they have created a chemical holy grail to kill all lung tuberculosis germs, named "SANOOIN." This medicine was invented successfully by following the latest medical principles of Dr. Koch of Germany, the inventor of the tubercle bacillus, and Dr. Berger of Germany, the inventor of the tubercle bacillus dewaxing technique. According to experimental reports from various pulmonary sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating lung lesions and dissolving the wax, and it also has bactericidal power. It can radically cure first, second, and third-stage pulmonary tuberculosis, and it certainly has a magical effect that works in every test. In China, the Central Hygiene Laboratory of the National Government has already verified the medicine's nature and determined that it is non-toxic and has no side effects. The treatment effect is briefly listed below:</p>
<p>(1) When testing the drug power of (SANOOIN) in a test tube, all tubercle bacilli disappeared after one minute. Its acid resistance was completely eliminated after three minutes, and this lung tubercle bacillus was completely killed without a single survivor.</p>
<p>(2) According to animal experiments, (SANOOIN) can penetrate tuberculous lesions. Checking for latent tubercle bacilli inside the lesions, they have all lost their acid resistance. This is sufficient proof that the wax has completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If patients take (SANOOIN) internally for about a week, they will immediately experience good conditions such as diluted phlegm and a drop in body temperature.</p>
<p>(4) Continuing to take (SANOOIN) internally for 30 to 60 days or more, there will be a noticeable increase in weight, a strong appetite, and all symptoms will gradually ease, eventually achieving the great effect of returning to life.</p>
<p>Free experimental reports of Sanooin and guides on pulmonary sanatoriums are available. Write to the Science Department of the American Trading Co. A.S. Watson &amp; Co., located at No. 35 Renji Road, Shanghai (i.e., the intersection of Sichuan Road and Renji Road), and they will be mailed to you immediately. After signing a sales contract with a local sugar merchant, Mr. Bi left for home yesterday. He told our reporter that the plan to promote Cuban sugar in China is about to be implemented. All necessary procedures have been negotiated and soon cheap Cuban sugar will begin to be shipped to China. Their investigation of the sugar market shows they believe Cuban sugar production can be greatly promoted here. The current sugar price for the Chinese people is higher than elsewhere, and the quality is not the best. At a time when sugar prices are falling sharply, this is not an ideal situation. In the future, after Cuban sugar is sold in China, it can reduce sugar prices and open up a way to promote Chinese manufactured goods, because they not only want to ship sugar to China, but also plan to ship Chinese goods to Cuba. As for their coming here specifically for promotion purposes, they do not plan to obtain special concessions from the government.</p>
<p>Taxpayers Association Urges the Municipal Council to</p>
<h3>Appoint Chinese People to Senior Positions</h3>
<p>According to the exchange of documents in 1928, the Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter yesterday to Mr. MacNaughton, Chairman of the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council, which read: I hereby inform you that since March 26, 1928, when your council exchanged documents with our association, four years have passed. The basis for the establishment of this exchange of documents was the sincerity of cooperation between China and foreign countries. However, your council has not fully implemented the provisions in this exchange of documents, and has not paid the slightest attention or implementation to the item of employing Chinese people as senior officials, which is truly regrettable. Our association believes that the current vacancy for the position of Director-General of your council should be filled by recruiting a Chinese person. According to the news published in the newspapers, your council does not seem to want to consider the spirit of the aforementioned exchange of documents. This is just news in the newspapers and may not be reliable. However, the fact that the vacancy has been vacant for a long time and your council has not appointed a Chinese person to fill the position seems to be the truth. In order to implement sincere cooperation, under the current system of your council, we request that a Chinese person be appointed to the position of Director-General, and that you immediately consider and implement the employment of Chinese people as Deputy Directors in other departments as well. We believe that your council's enthusiasm for sincere cooperation will not be less than that of our association. We are sending this letter accordingly and hope you will investigate and resolve it satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>Edward Sues the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The consuls of five countries held a joint trial in the Municipal Council yesterday. Edward, the suspended Director-General of the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council, is suing the Municipal Council for compensation of £5,000, payment of salary until the end of next year's contract, and travel expenses back to England for himself and his family. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 p.m., a mixed court was formed by the Belgian Consul-General Van Haute, the British Consul-General Bailey Naim, the American Consul-General Jenkins, the German Consul-General Grimann, and the Japanese Consul-General Muratsu, and the trial began in the Municipal Council conference room. The court adjourned at 5:00 p.m. The Belgian Consul-General served as the chairman. The plaintiff's lawyer, Harris, stated Edward's case against the Municipal Council, saying that Edward was originally going to take an important position in the Irish Free State, but was hired by the Municipal Council to come to Shanghai to serve as the Director-General of the council. The contract term was three years, but the oral agreement was that Edward's position as Director-General was permanent, that is, his contract would have to be renewed every three years. Now the Municipal Council has notified the plaintiff that this contract will not be renewed after it expires, so he has filed a lawsuit requesting compensation. The defendant's lawyer, Reid, stood up and denied that there was such an oral agreement, and said that the Municipal Council has the right to hire and dismiss any of its employees based on the Yangjingbang Land Regulations. Edward's position as Director-General was not permanent. The Municipal Council has the right to dismiss him based on these regulations. In addition, when Edward's wife came to Shanghai from England, the Municipal Council paid for her travel expenses, but at that time the Municipal Council sent a letter to Edward stating that if his contract was not renewed after three years, the travel expenses paid by the Municipal Council for his wife should be reimbursed by Edward. This letter can also prove that Edward's position as Director-General was not permanent. Edward then sat in the witness chair and repeatedly stated the permanence of his position as Director-General. Consul-General Van Haute of Belgium announced the adjournment of the court due to lateness and rescheduled the trial for a later date.</p>
<h3>Important Shipping News</h3>
<p>Northeast China Vessels Sail. Mr. Li, the Director-General of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to develop Northeast shipping and recover lost shipping rights, specially dispatched Zhang Jicai to Yingkou to set up a branch office. This matter has now been completed, and Yingkou has also been unfrozen. Various shipping companies in Shanghai have decided to resume shipping to Northeast China starting today. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also decided yesterday to send the "Gongping" vessel to officially start the Northeast route starting today. The first class of graduates from the navigation school attached to the company have been assigned to seagoing vessels to practice piloting skills in preparation for recovering foreign crew members. Mr. Li, the Director-General, has also assigned them to the "Gongping" vessel as trainee crew members, with a one-year term, starting today to learn the necessary common sense and experience for sailing on the ship.</p>
<p>Huge Sum of Money Shipped to the United States. The second batch of huge sums of money shipped to the United States is still being declared and装装 by Chase Bank. A total of 28,000 gold bars are being transported by the Central Bank, divided into more than 100 boxes, and transported to the United States on the "President Cleveland" of Dollar Steamship Lines. After being transferred to small barges at the customs pier, the gold cargo was transferred to large ships and shipped directly to San Francisco. It has already been exported yesterday.</p>
<p>Continued News on the "Xin Kang" Vessel Case. After the Shanghai Special District Court accepted the case of the Japanese vessel "Ryuno Maru" sinking the "Xin Kang," the second hearing was held on the 2nd of this month. Judge Fu inquired about the ship Shidexing for a long time, proving that the responsibility lay entirely with the Japanese. Because the court still needs to investigate further, it has set the 31st of this month to continue the trial.</p>
<h3>Shipping News Between China and Russia</h3>
<p>East Railway Development Affairs. In order to expand its commercial transportation to China, the Chinese Eastern Railway has established a commercial office of the Eastern Provincial Railway in Shanghai. In recent years, its business has gradually progressed. Since Mr. Wei Gaobasuo and Mr. Qian Jiezhen were appointed as the director and deputy director stationed in Shanghai last year, there has been significant progress in the shipping business. In previous years, due to political instability, there were losses. Since this year, Wei and Qian have started to expand and reorganize the company, and this month has achieved a profit, breaking previous records.</p>
<p>Facilitating Direct Shipping. In order to facilitate the transportation of goods to Vladivostok and northern Manchuria, Russia, the Eastern Provincial Railway Commercial Office has specified preferential treatment for Shanghai guests who declare Soviet fleet ships. It hopes that guests will directly contact Wei and Qian at the office (No. 5 Guangdong Road), and they will be given special convenience and generous rebates.</p>
<p>The Fleet Adds Rented Chinese Vessels. Since the Soviet Commercial Fleet resumed the China-Berbera route last year, there has been a link between cargo transportation by sea and land. Now that Sino-Russian trade is just beginning, the fleet has completely entrusted the management of Chinese shipping to the Eastern Railway Commercial Office. It has dispatched multiple vessels to Shanghai to load Chinese tea and other goods to Russia. Because more Manchurian miscellaneous grains are being shipped from Vladivostok, and Shanghai's goods to Vladivostok have also increased, the commercial fleet has entrusted the office to rent ten Chinese merchant vessels in Shanghai to transport goods to Vladivostok and the coastal states, such as Minghe, Longshan, Taishan, and Hengshan of Sanbei, which have been rented by the team and will set sail for Vladivostok in the next few days.</p>

<h3>News of Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen of the Tobacco Industry Coming to China</h3>
<p>The Millard's Review commented on the attempt of Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen, a giant in the British tobacco industry, to come to China, saying that the news recently reported in London about Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen, chairman of British American Tobacco, coming to China has aroused the attention of Chinese political circles and Chinese and Western tobacco merchants. The British Economic Survey Group came to China, then returned, and the British government's proposal to return 3 million pounds of the Boxer Indemnity to China has been approved by Parliament, and now Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen has come to China one after another. The point of attention in this news is that Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen's coming to China seems to be closely related to the plan of Sino-British tobacco industry cooperation. Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen is a giant in British American Tobacco, which monopolizes the world's cigarette industry, and his position in the world's tobacco industry is very important. He was born in 1877 and studied engineering at Brighton and Cliiton University, but soon changed careers and joined British American Tobacco, first as vice chairman and then as chairman. Although there has been no official announcement about his mission this time, according to the news, it seems to be related to the plan to establish a cigarette monopoly in China. The nature of this monopoly is roughly modeled after the Japanese government's monopoly system, which seeks to control the national cigarette manufacturing industry. This plan has long been agreed upon by important members of the Kuomintang, but to realize this plan, a large amount of money is necessary, and we have to rely on the cooperation of Chinese and Western tobacco merchants. Although British American Tobacco once monopolized the Chinese cigarette industry, its import volume has been greatly affected recently due to the increase in tariffs, which gives Chinese tobacco factories a very good opportunity to compete, because the latter's expenses are much more frugal than British American Tobacco's. According to customs reports, British American Tobacco imports about 130 million pounds to 200 million pounds of cigarettes each year, but it has been reduced a lot due to the increase in tariffs. At the same time, the annual import of tobacco leaves is about 500,000 pounds, which has also gradually decreased due to the competition from Chinese tobacco factories. Although the total number of cigarettes manufactured by Chinese tobacco factories is unknown, it is estimated that the number is more than the imported cigarettes. The United States' cigarette production and consumption in 1930 totaled 120 trillion, and the US government collected a total of 360 million US dollars, an increase of 17.5 trillion US dollars compared to the previous year. According to the report submitted to Congress by US Treasury Secretary Mellon last winter, tobacco tax revenue is the second most important income for the US government after income tax, and it is not affected by commercial recession. According to Mellon's report, cigarette consumption in the United States has doubled in the past ten years. Although the US tobacco industry is entirely privately operated, the government uses a stamp tax system in the locations of each tobacco factory and imposes heavy taxes, and the national treasury can obtain significant income every year. The China Yearbook of 1930 does not have a clear record of the total production and news of Chinese cigarettes, only mentioning in the "Wages" chapter on page 552 that "British American Tobacco is the largest tobacco factory in China and briefly supplies the necessary materials."</p>
<p>Tax-Free Native Cloth</p>
<h3>Request to Facilitate the Shipping of Exports</h3>
<p>The Native Cloth Trade Association of the City presented documents to the two ministries and two departments, requesting that the shipping of native cloth for export be facilitated and unimpeded. The documents were submitted separately to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Tariff and Tax Departments. The original presentation was as follows: To request that the tax-free native cloth be shipped for export, please instruct the National Customs and Tax Departments to comply with the tax collection regulations issued by the ministry, so that the shipping of exports is unimpeded to benefit commerce and emphasize the people's livelihood. It is secretly managed by the Native Cloth Trade Association. The buying and selling of artificial hand-woven native cloth was ordered by the Ministry of Industry on June 22, 1928, to comply with the resolution of the National Government to regard hand-woven cloth as a major national product. The supply and demand sides are mostly poor people. In order to promote domestic goods and maintain people's livelihood, following the 70% reduction case, the Ministry of Industry issued a notice according to the six standards, exempting the tax and informing the matter. The current issuance of the unified tax requires customs declarations to request unified tax certificates from the customs. This is a necessary procedure in handling affairs. However, in addition to the approval order and the six standards from the Ministry of Industry, there are no other documents that can be certified with the goods after this native cloth is exempted from tax. They are all copied from the order and the six standards of the association, and they state that tens of thousands of weaving households are scattered in the countryside, and they are all poor people whose purchasing power of yarn is only about a small bag weighing no more than nine kilograms. The unified tax certificate cannot be obtained indirectly or indirectly. The city's Chamber of Commerce added a certificate to this, which was transferred to the Customs and Tax Department for verification. The Customs and Tax Department gave a certificate and approved the shipping of exports. It has been found that artificial hand-woven native cloth is the main product of the country, and the national government has given it special tax exemptions and pays attention to the virtue of people's livelihood. Its area is from Yantai, Shandong, to Fuzhou, Guangdong, Huangzhou, Hubei, Yangluo, Huizhou, Xingning, Jiangxi, Nanchang, Wenqu, Shaoxing of Zhejiang, Yuyao, Taichong, Tonghai, Changshu, Wujin of Suzhou, or areas producing cotton or provinces that sell it. Once the shipment is hindered, it will greatly affect business relations. For this reason, the details of the past are presented in detail, requesting that the Ministry review and approve it quickly. Please instruct the National Customs and Tax Department to check the tax collection regulations promulgated by the Ministry, and do not make things difficult for the declaration and shipment of artificial hand-woven native cloth, so as to benefit commercial transportation and maintain people's livelihood. We will be extremely grateful. We humbly request approval and compliance, except for submitting it to the Ministry of Industry. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Request Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>Tea Industry. The Tea Industry Association submitted a document to the Central Government, saying: We respectfully address the Minister of Finance of the National Government in Nanjing. We humbly believe that last year, the government issued a clear order to abolish likin and eliminate malpractice, and the whole country was well governed and the people rejoiced. Merchants and people heard the news and rejoiced even more, hoping to alleviate the difficulties of commerce and take this opportunity to recuperate. However, the abolition of likin was not uniform, and then the Business Tax Law was promulgated. Therefore, the governments of various provinces and cities obtained this item of business tax and knew how to formulate different tax rates, ignoring the Ministry's Outline of Business Tax, which made the tax law chaotic, and the merchants of various industries were panicked and called for petitions. This is all because the tax rates set by the provinces and cities have exceeded the outline of the Ministry. We humbly believe that the tea industry is a major agricultural product of the country. Historically, domestic products sold overseas have relied on tea and silk. The government should reduce various taxes on tea to promote it at the top and to improve it among farmers and businesses, so that it can be promoted at the bottom. If taxes are increased and costs are high, there is no profit to be made, and farmers and businesses will be in trouble. Chinese tea will inevitably be naturally eliminated, which will have a great impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. According to newspaper reports, the business tax rate for tea in Jiangsu Province is proposed to be a slight 0.5%, which is more than double the Ministry's Outline of Business Tax. Although this record cannot be regarded as a final decision, it is not without reason. Implementation is to put tea in a desperate situation. However, tea is a necessity for the poor and rich, not a luxury item, but an auxiliary to the daily diet of people's lives, and it has foreign trade relations. It can only be determined as an agricultural product, which is no different from cotton, bamboo, wood, and mountain goods. If the business tax of 0.5% is slightly collected, it not only violates the Ministry's tax law but also loses the principle of tax balance. Our association has no choice but to make a painful and straightforward statement. We humbly request that the tea business tax rate be reduced to 0.15%, and that the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance be instructed to comply with it in order to relieve business difficulties and maintain domestic products, which is a public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Finance of the National Government in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Antique Industry. The Guowen News Agency reported that the Shanghai Antique Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the request to reduce the business tax, saying: We secretly read the draft business tax prepared by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments. The item of the antique industry is listed as a luxury item and taxed at 2%, which is extremely alarming. The antique industry is not only insufficient in the modern era to supplement any other business, but it is also declining day by day. The reasons are complex. In short, antiques were originally a product of peacetime, but now the purchasing power and interest in antiquities have been sharply reduced in direct proportion due to current events and economic relations. Secondly, the number of antiques absorbed by foreigners in the Qing Dynasty and lost in the years of war is difficult to count. According to the principles of economics, the current demand for antiques is equal to zero, and the supply is decreasing day by day, almost to the point where there is no supply. The so-called modern antique dealers do not call antiques, but they have already had another tendency and are not antiques. What is the trend? That is, it has changed from ancient to imitating the ancient, and all kinds of categories such as porcelain, steel, bamboo, stone, jade, silk, and books are competing to imitate the ancient, and the manufacturing is becoming more and more refined. In terms of artistic value, there is a lot of improvement. Then today's antiques are really just a variant of art. In other words, it is a modern Chinese national product. Moreover, most of these antique imitations belong to practical items. The reason why this trend can still maintain the status quo is because the value of imitations is low, and foreigners purchase them to replace daily necessities. It is not as if antiques cannot supply the needs and are only embellishments in peacetime. Since this trend has been constructed, those who rely on imitation for a living, even in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, number around 200,000 people, all of whom are engaged in handicrafts. To sum up, it can be concluded that modern antiques are modern works of art, daily national products produced by hand. The so-called antique industry is just a merchant who sells these national goods, and their business situation is only enough to maintain their current status. Now, I suddenly heard that the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments are drafting a 2% business tax, which is equivalent to imposing a huge burden on our industry and an indirect blow to imitators. It will be even more difficult for our industry to maintain its current status. We respectfully present the trend of our industry's transformation to the Association, and we humbly request that you transfer it to the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government, and humbly ask them to observe the difficulties of the merchants and approve the exemption from listing it as a luxury item and draft it lightly in order to maintain commerce and benefit people's livelihood. In addition to sending representatives to present it at any time, we respectfully submit this.</p>

<p>Three Gambling Dens</p>
<h3>More than Seventy Gamblers</h3>
<p>The largest gambling cases in the three concessions. The Old Zha, New Zha, and Putuo Road Police Stations have cracked down on three gambling dens in their respective jurisdictions in the past two days, with more than 70 gamblers arrested, which is the largest gambling case in recent times. Each case is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The gambling den seized by the Old Zha Police Station on Tianjin Road was attached to Room 3 of the Phoenix Hotel on Tianjin Road. It had been cracked down on by the police a week ago, and more than 20 male and female gamblers were escorted to the Special District Local Court for fines. However, it still did not stop, and gambling was still held every night. Yesterday morning at 1:00, Chinese and Western detectives went to check and seize it for the second time. Thirty male and female gamblers, including Wang Changcai, Li A'er, Jiang Yuting, Li Gansheng, Ma Yangshi, and Fang Wushi, were captured in Rooms 47 and 48, along with gambling tools such as dominoes and poker, and gambling funds. They were all taken back to the police station and detained separately, waiting to be escorted to the court for interrogation.</p>
<p>The New Zha Police Station on Jing'an Temple Road arrested 22 gamblers in a house at No. 754 Jing'an Temple Road at 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. After being taken back to the police station along with the gambling tools, it was found that the leaders of the gambling were Li Jinbiao and Cai Youqin. The remaining 20 gamblers, including Wu Zhuxing, Chen Yanfu, Yu Lao San, and Lu A'hai, were all gamblers. Yesterday morning, they were all escorted to the Simple Criminal Court of the Special Court, where Judge Luo interrogated them one by one and sentenced them separately. The gambling tools were confiscated.</p>
<p>The Putuo Road Police Station on Robison Road reported that Jiang A'wu was opening a gambling den at No. 4615 Robison Road. The chief of the Chinese and Western police led detectives to arrest Jiang and 24 gamblers, including Lin A'yu, Zhang Xiaomei, Weng Heshang, Zhang A'da, Xie Ketong, and Liu A'yu, along with gambling tools, at 9:45 p.m. the night before yesterday. They were all detained in the police station and sent to the Special Court yesterday. The judge of the Simple Criminal Court interrogated them and sentenced them to fines, and the gambling tools were confiscated.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Bandit</p>
<h3>Yang Huanian Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Before the execution, he advised people to love the country and claimed to be from a noble family. The kidnapping bandit Yang Huanian kidnapped Jiang Baozhen, who lived at No. 445 Chunzai Lane, Xin Zha Bridge, in collusion with his gang on September 5th last year at 9:00 a.m. Later, he was captured by the police and sent to the Special District Local Court, where he was sentenced to death. After being approved by the superior, he was executed yesterday afternoon. Judge Cheng Shangfeng opened the court and ordered the police to bring the Yang bandit from the West Prison for sentencing and announced that the death penalty would be executed. He was then asked if he had any last words. According to Yang's confession, he was 23 years old and a local. He wanted to write a letter to his wife to be forwarded to his parents. Judge Cheng ordered him to be given paper and pen. Yang immediately dipped in ink and wrote a letter. After writing it, he presented it to the judge for forwarding and said that he had no other last words. Judge Cheng ordered two silver dollars to be taken out to buy wine and food for him. After he finished eating, he sent the Chinese and Western detectives to escort him to the Caohejing Supervision Ground in a prison car. He also notified the Local Court to appoint Prosecutor Yang as the supervising officer. He ordered Police Chief Xu Jinqing and Police Inspector Chen Xihui to supervise and accompany the execution. Execution police Wang Jianqing, Gu Hanqing, Zhu Wanruan, and Cai Zuoqing also rushed to the execution ground. After the judge and Warden Dong Changmin took their seats, they brought the Yang bandit to the stand. He confessed that he was 22 years old and from Pudong. He requested to write a letter to his wife at No. 6 Xihua Lane, Xieqiao, to collect his body. He said, "I am from a noble family. I advise my countrymen to always love the country." The judge then ordered the execution. The criminal stood without kneeling, so he was executed while standing. The body was collected by the hall.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Cracked in Minhang</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinshi escaped. Wang Xilong escorted to the county. Zhang Shutang, a farmer in Wujiaku, Hexi, Yexie Town, Songjiang, Shanghai County, had dozens of acres of farmland and was a well-off family. At midnight the night before yesterday, five kidnappers suddenly came to kidnap Zhang. Zhang happened to be invited out by friends to drink. The bandit gang was greatly disappointed, so they kidnapped Zhang's wife, Zhang Jinshi (who had been ill since August last year), and Zhang's ten-year-old niece, A'nan, and fled. Zhang returned home and learned of this and chased after them. On the morning of the next day at 10:00 a.m., a police patrol led by the director of the first branch of the Shanghai County Minhang Town Public Security Bureau passed by the Huangpu Beach on the south side of the Ku'er Hospital in the town and heard a low voice of a woman crying in a small broken rowboat. He immediately boarded the boat for inspection and learned the details and said that there were two bandits in the boat who had gone ashore to buy things. The police also copied out brown ropes and other items in the boat, so they took the woman to the police station. They divided and searched in the town and saw a person with a panicked expression, knowing that he was not a good person. He was arrested and brought to the bureau. When the director of the branch, Xingbang, ordered the bandit to be brought to the case for interrogation, he confessed his name was Wang Xilong, who used to be a tailor and lived in Tanlai Temple, and admitted to kidnapping Zhang Jinshi and others. He also sent a message to Zhang Jinshi, who confessed that she was 42 years old. Last night, the kidnappers took her and her niece A'nan out and traveled to the middle of the journey. A'nan was taken by the bandits to another place. Director Zhang immediately prepared a document stating that the case was about kidnapping and extortion and sent the bandit Wang Xilong and the victim Zhang Jinshi to the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Guangxin Fellow Villagers Association [Received Telegram Regarding Bandit Suppression P] The Shanghai Guangxin Fellow Villagers Association received a telegram from the General Commander's Headquarters, which read: "To the Shanghai Jiangxi Guangxin Seven Counties Native Place Association: We have received and read your telegram. Regarding the matters you mentioned, that the Fujian People's Association and bandit leaders Wang Minggui, Ding Zhumin, etc., have recently colluded with Fang Shao's bandit gang, attempting to trample on towns and villages, causing harm to the local area, we have already telegraphed Commanders Ruan and Xu to strictly carry out bandit suppression." Respectfully, South Chang General Headquarters</h3>
<p>Requesting the Shanghai Silk Light Cotton Weaving Association to Exchange Yarn Unified Tax Receipts The Silk Light Cotton Weaving Association previously, due to the Unified Tax Bureau's notification to the Customs regarding a list of duty-free fabrics with many omissions, specially sent a letter to the relevant manufacturers yesterday, stating that before the matter is resolved, they should temporarily pay customs duties in order to exchange yarn unified tax receipts at the Unified Tax Bureau. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern, according to regulations, the cotton fabrics woven by our association should be duty-free. However, due to many omissions in the list of fabrics notified by the Unified Tax Bureau to the Customs (the list only includes coarse and fine cloth, twill, and Indanthrene blue cloth; all other cotton fabric names are omitted), our association has sent a list to the Unified Tax Bureau, requesting notification to the Customs that all types of finished products directly woven from cotton yarn should be duty-free according to regulations. However, before the Unified Tax Bureau and the Customs reach an agreement (expected to be resolved in approximately two to three days), if any members urgently need to export, they can temporarily pay customs duties. Bring the customs receipt to the relevant office of the Unified Tax Bureau to get a stamp of verification, and then submit the yarn unified tax receipt to our association. The association will then collect all receipts and go to the third section of the Tax Bureau to reclaim the tax, or each factory can go directly to reclaim it. This letter is specially sent to inform you, hoping you will investigate and take note of it."</p>
<p>Shaanxi Disaster Relief Actively Underway There has been no shortage of people voluntarily donating. The Shaanxi Provincial Emergency Relief Committee has been actively soliciting donations in Shanghai in recent days, receiving enthusiastic support from various charitable organizations and groups. Yesterday, there were also individuals and laborers who voluntarily donated, amounting to over 5,000 yuan. Furthermore, Liu Huangshi and Cang Dexuan specially delivered their savings from years of thrift to the committee yesterday, totaling 2,300 yuan. The committee plans to publish a list of the received funds in the newspaper every week as a form of commendation. The following is a record of yesterday's correspondence and telegrams:</p>
<p>Telegram from Shaanxi: "To Chairman Tuan and all chairmen of the Renji Hall Shaanxi Disaster Emergency Relief Association: I have just received Consultant Sun Longji's telegram, respectfully acknowledging that your association has appointed nine philanthropists as the Chairman Tuan, looking forward to the rain and dew from afar, bestowing the virtue of rebirth upon the three auxiliary regions. The compassionate clouds spread widely, and the people are grateful for the kindness of saving lives. I reverently gaze upon the Buddha's seat, determined to cooperate with private sincerity. I respectfully send a congratulatory telegram first, humbly requesting compassion for the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Association Wen."</p>
<p>Letter to the Chamber of Commerce: "Respectfully, I previously thank your chamber of commerce for inviting various industry groups to publicly discuss raising funds for the Shaanxi emergency relief, which is a testament to your benevolence and concern. Your high advocacy is deeply appreciated. Upon receiving the confirmation from the representatives of various industries attending the meeting to form groups for fundraising, I am deeply grateful. Now, I am sending one hundred donation registers, requesting your inspection and receipt. Please distribute them to various industry associations. In the future, the donations from various industries will still be collected by your chamber of commerce for convenience and ease of progress. In addition to sending another letter from our association to various industry associations, requesting them to promptly solicit donations and make payments, I am sending this letter to request your strong and timely urging so that the relief funds can be gathered as soon as possible, and the disaster victims can be saved one day sooner. I cannot express my prayers enough. Sincerely, to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Various Sectors Provide Assistance The Shanghai Banking Association held a meeting yesterday to welcome Mr. Ou Ying Zhu Qinglan. Guests Bincheng, Mianzhong, Wang Yiting, and bank managers Zhang Gongquan, Wu Yunzhai, Xu Ji, Qian Xinzhi, and over thirty others attended. Chairman Lin Kanghou reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that Mr. Zhu Ziqiao's enthusiasm and determination in coming to Shanghai to raise funds for the Shaanxi disaster victims were admirable. He stated that all members of the banking industry should donate as much as they can to fulfill their responsibilities. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao stood up to express his gratitude and welcome the intentions. He then detailed the severity of the disaster in Shaanxi, stating that although he had gone to distribute relief three times, he still relied on enthusiastic comrades to donate continuously during this time of year when food was scarce. As a result, the attendees pledged to donate over twenty thousand yuan. Furthermore, Mr. Lin Kanghou was requested to personally take the donation register tomorrow to solicit donations from the banks that did not attend today, with an expected additional ten thousand yuan or more to be raised. Afterwards, a film about the Shaanxi disaster was shown, and the meeting adjourned at approximately six o'clock.</p>
<p>Wang Peiyuan, Chairman of the Chinese Red Cross Society, and Honorary Liaison Wang Zhen visited Mr. Zhu yesterday morning and mentioned that the Red Cross Society was also in the process of raising funds for Shaanxi relief. Mr. Zhu stated that the disaster situation in Shaanxi was not only a matter of people crying out for food but also rampant epidemics, requiring urgent medical treatment. He requested the Red Cross Society to provide medical supplies. Mr. Wang Peiyuan agreed to report to the Economic Committee of the society to raise funds and purchase medicines for transportation to the disaster area for treatment. Additionally, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai and the Shaoxing Native Place Association in Shanghai are scheduled to jointly host a banquet for Mr. Zhu Ziqiao at 6:00 PM on the 18th at the Ningbo Native Place Association.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Pucheng Looks Forward to Relief Eagerly The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Received Report from the Branch The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association received a letter from the Pucheng Chinese and Foreign Relief Branch yesterday, which read: "The disaster in the Northwest is unprecedented, especially in several counties such as Pucheng. Fortunately, with the successive relief from your general association and various charitable organizations, the relief supplies have been continuously arriving, allowing the disaster victims who were on the verge of death to extend their lives and avoid starvation. The virtue of rebirth is deeply appreciated, and songs of praise are everywhere, which is truly an honor for your association. However, the remaining days of the lunar year have ended, and the new year has begun. This is the time when food is scarce, known as the 'difficult month,' which is a major turning point for the survival of the disaster victims. As the saying goes, 'Don't fear the beginning of a famine year, only fear the end of a famine year.' This is because, at this time, people are exhausted and drained, having pawned everything they have, leaving no way out. Therefore, the hope for relief is like looking forward to clouds in a severe drought. Those coming to seek relief are endless. Seeing this situation, our association believes that if we do not take measures to provide relief, the previous efforts will be in vain, which is truly regrettable." It is heard that the report received by the association is not only about Pucheng but also about the entire Shaanxi province. The severity and extent of the disaster are unprecedented. It is difficult for a clever housewife to cook without rice. It is impossible to sit idly by while pacing around the room. Therefore, it is necessary to seek assistance from all sectors.</p>
<p>Representatives from Henan to Come to Shanghai The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from the Henan Relief Association yesterday, which read: "The Chinese Red Cross Society, with sincere regards, the province of Yu has been plagued by disasters for many years, and the harassment of soldiers and bandits has caused great suffering to the people, which is difficult to express in writing. Now, the spring famine is arriving, and the wilderness is desolate. Food supplies have been exhausted, and there is no way to make a living. Although the central government and charitable organizations in the north and south have provided substantial relief repeatedly,</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>(Sixteen) distributing it at any time, the disaster area is so vast that relief is difficult to provide, and the people are helpless and lack the means to raise funds. Therefore, our association has entrusted representative Zhu Ruiying to go to Beijing and Shanghai to appeal for help. In addition to submitting a separate report on the disaster situation, suffering, and relief plans, we also hope that you will provide liaison and quick relief. We cannot express our anticipation enough. Respectfully, Zhang Fang, Henan Relief Association, and Yu Jisheng."</p>
<p>Recent News from the Jisheng Society The Chinese Jisheng Society is Handling Industrial Relief in Taizhou The Chinese Jisheng Society is handling industrial relief in Linhai and Ninghai counties, Zhejiang. The association first handled winter relief in the winter of the 18th year due to the consecutive years of severe famine in Taizhou. In the spring of the 19th year, it continued to handle spring relief. It was noted that due to the lack of water conservancy, the dikes and weirs in various places had collapsed, resulting in floods when it rained and droughts when there was no rain. During the summer, dikes and weirs were built in Linhai and Ninghai counties. In Linhai, Wang Jun Huaiqing was in charge, and in Ninghai, Sun Jun Yinting was in charge. From autumn to winter, and from winter to spring, although the inner dikes were gradually completed, the outer dikes were not yet finished. The industrial relief was vast, requiring too much funding. The association handles emergency relief in various provinces and also handles industrial relief. Their efforts to provide relief are commendable. Yesterday, a letter was received from Ninghai Ye, a gentry from Zibu, which read: "Your association, due to the consecutive years of disaster in our county, publicly recommended Director Sun Yinting to come to Ninghai to build dikes and dams. The dikes in Guzhang and other villages have been gradually constructed, benefiting the local area with sincerity and practicality. However, due to the limited funding, the Chuandong Xinlao Pingyan Three Ponds in that village have not yet been repaired. It is found that if the ponds are not repaired, once they are damaged, the tidal water will flood into Sandu, which must be completed. The letter requests your association to complete the project in order to benefit future generations."</p>
<p>Shaanxi Relief Recently Remitted The Chinese Jisheng Society remitted 10,000 yuan to the Chang'an Branch of the Shaanxi Relief Association in Jingyang the other day. The money was transferred from Fuyuan Village and received by Zili Junhao. The association publicly elected Yunmen and Ma Jintao as supervisors to be sent to Shaanxi to investigate and monitor the progress of the relief efforts. They are scheduled to depart by train on the 16th to Shaanxi to monitor and investigate the implementation of everything.</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Met Yesterday to Discuss the Gaochang Temple Case More than ten days have passed since the Gaochang Temple incident involving Huashang Electric workers and naval aviation workers, but it has not yet been resolved. The Public Security, Social Affairs, and Public Utilities Bureaus were ordered to go to various parties to investigate the truth. Now that the investigation has been completed, a meeting was held at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss the solution. Chen Yangmin, staff member of the Public Security Bureau, Xu Zhi and Zhu Gui, staff members of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Jinhai, staff member of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Lin Meiyan of the Municipal Party Department attended. It is heard that the tram workers' union will discuss this case at the election of directors, supervisors, and members at 1:00 AM today.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Industry Revises Labor-Management Conditions It will be handled after the trade union is organized. The Municipal Pharmaceutical Industry Association, in view of the fact that the thirteen articles of the treatment conditions previously agreed upon by labor and management conflicted with the current Trade Union Law and Chamber of Commerce Law, was ordered by the Central Government to revise them. It immediately stated the reasons and submitted new conditions to the Labor-Management Issues Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for review. It was deemed that there were no conflicts with the current laws and regulations. The original text of the old conditions and the reasons for deleting the revised conditions were submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification. It has been a long time. The capitalists have sent representatives Zhuang Meitang and others to petition, requesting prompt revision. The bureau approved the order to the Pharmaceutical Industry Association yesterday, stating that the application has been received and that the trade union should be organized strictly and that after the trade union is legally cancelled and the employees legally join the Industry and Commerce Association, the bureau will review it together with the Municipal Party Department. Please be patient and do not worry to avoid disputes. This approval was also approved to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform the Municipal Party Department.</p>
<p>Industry Regulations Should Be Submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for Approval The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the various industry associations. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified the various industry associations that the chamber of commerce had previously sent personnel to guide the temporary meeting of members' representatives held by the Shushui Store Industry Association and passed an industry regulation, which was included in the January 20th work report. Now, it has been presented to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau No. 6834. The presentation and report have been reviewed. According to the report, the Shushui Store Industry Association held a temporary meeting of members' representatives and sent personnel to guide the passage of an industry regulation, but the regulation was not submitted to the bureau for approval. The association has therefore produced water ladles without authorization in accordance with Article 7 of the regulations and issued a notice forcing its members to pay for and use them, resulting in disputes, which is very inappropriate. In addition to ordering the association to recall the water ladles that have been issued and notifying the Shushui store merchants in the city, it also instructs the affiliated associations to inform each other that any industry regulations must be submitted to the bureau for approval before they become effective. Do not violate this, otherwise, it will cause inconvenience. This batch is due to the notification.</p>
<p>Meeting Minutes of the Board of Directors of the Industrial and Commercial Management Association The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its seventh board meeting at the Lianhua General Association the other day. Directors Liu Hongsheng, Xu Jiqing, Mu Ouchu, Hu Shuhua, Li Quanshi, Shou Yicheng, Qian Chengxu, etc. attended. First, they discussed the proposal research issues ordered by the Ministry of Industry and agreed that each director should study them separately and discuss them at the eighth board meeting. Second, they discussed the issue of cooperation with the Zhejiang and Shandong Provincial Branches and resolved to discuss it further when the two provincial branches were officially established. Xu Jiqing was additionally elected as the economic director. If Director Pan Xulun goes to Beijing, Director Xu can add a seal to all receipts and expenditures. The issue of publications was discussed next. It was decided to first open up several columns in the Industrial and Commercial Semi-Monthly to publish famous works on scientific management and industrial rationalization and association news, and then publish the Industrial and Commercial Management Monthly. The meeting adjourned at 7 o'clock.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests an Investigation into the Detention of Goods The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the government yesterday, which read: "The report is hereby submitted for consideration of the facts. According to the letter from the China Cotton Industry Federation, Mr. Zhang Jisheng, manager of Hengxing Flower Factory, a member of the cotton ginning department of our association, reported that our factory has been doing business with Wusong Yongan Yarn Factory for a long time without any errors and has not been interfered with by any management agency. Because Yongan urgently needs cotton waste, it was ordered to sell cotton waste from a cotton gin. One hundred and fifty bales were loaded onto the Agen ship on the 4th of this month and shipped to Yongan Factory for unloading. Unexpectedly, the ship left at 3:00 PM and received news from Wusong in the evening that the goods were missing. We immediately sent people to investigate, but there was no result. We immediately reported to the Water Patrol Team of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation. Later, we learned that the cotton waste was actually pulled away and detained by the arresting soldiers of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Team. After repeated inquiries, we finally caught a glimpse of it next to the Xintongfeng steamboat parked across from the Yunzaobang Yongchang Wharf. Zhang Luyuan, a fellow from our factory, reported to the water patrol team in charge and went there with them. They only saw two bales of cotton waste hidden in the stern of the ship. The shipowner, Lu Agen, and others were imprisoned in the bow of the ship, guarded by soldiers with guns. Zhang sought to speak with him to ask about the reason, but the soldiers did not allow it. Later, Lu Agen's brother, Gengxiang, returned to the factory and reported. We inquired about the reasons for the sudden detention by the Public Security Team. It was said that on that day, when sailing eastward out of the harbor with the tide, when it reached the opposite bank of the Yangshupu Electric Light Factory, two boats suddenly appeared, one from the east (the Xintongfeng currently parked in Yunzaobang) and another small boat from the west. Some soldiers in uniform and two plainclothes men boarded our boat with handguns and ordered us to stop. They urgently asked where the cotton waste came from. We replied that it was the goods of the Yangjing Hengxing Flower Factory and was being shipped to Yongan Factory in Wusong. The four men sternly shouted, 'Don't say that! Someone reported Agen!' Agen did not answer, saying he didn't know. The four men then ordered us to tow it to Yunzaobang and park. It was already dusk. Our boat was next to the Xintongfeng, and we were taken to the boat for interrogation. Agen replied that he didn't know. A soldier raised his giant palm and slapped Agen on the cheek, saying, 'If you don't tell me, I will kill you!' All kinds of threats were too unspeakable. Later, we witnessed the soldiers carrying two bales of cotton waste onto the boat and digging out the cotton waste and hiding it in their prepared white bags like pillows. Gengxiang stopped them from stealing the cotton waste and was slapped on the cheek. Later, the captain came to ask if there were any foreigners on the boat. Agen replied no. Until the 8th, when the situation became urgent, Agen was taken to the boat again in the afternoon, escorted until the evening, and sent to the West District. The two bales of cotton waste were also moved back to the original boat, etc. It is found that Hengxing Flower Factory has always been a legitimate business and has been doing business with Yongan for a long time, and the goods are urgently needed. Suddenly, they were forcibly detained. If the goods are not criminal, why are they detained and not released? Why are the cotton waste detained and then dug out? The intention is unknown. Since the entire boat was detained, why only move two bales of cotton waste onto the boat and then suddenly move them back? All kinds of strange situations are inexplicable. Moreover, beating innocent boatmen is cruel. Where is the law? The waters and land in the Shanghai urban area belong to the city. Why does the provincial public security detain and harm merchants? Our association is deeply confused by the team's reckless and illegal actions, imprisoning boatmen, and transferring them to the law office. In addition to telegraphing the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs for thorough investigation, we are hereby requesting your association to review and approve the case and request that it be forwarded to the Municipal Government and promptly ordered the team to return the original number of cotton waste to ensure commercial security and request strict investigation. It is learned that Wusong Ouzhaobang and other places are under the jurisdiction of the city, but the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Team dared to detain the merchant ship carrying goods without authorization and move the cotton waste, preventing the legitimate flower shipping households from delivering it to the yarn factory on time for weaving, which seriously hindered commerce. In addition to the direct submission by the joint association to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs for investigation, because the matter is of great concern, it is necessary to present the case for consideration.</p>
<p>Road Construction Beyond the Boundary and Telephone Contracts There is still more to be said about the contracts. The contract between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and Huayang Delüfeng Company expired at the end of last year. Both parties felt the need to maintain communication between the Chinese and foreign concession areas. It was decided to maintain communication while continuing to negotiate the contract with the company. After the contract principles are determined, they will be submitted to the ministry for review and approval, and the ministry will consult with the Shanghai Municipal Government for record. Once approved, new telephone users in the Western District and various road construction areas outside the concession will be able to apply for installation. Now, it can only be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>The Ninth Division Sent Personnel to Shanghai To Purchase Clubhouse Equipment Commander Jiang Dingwen of the Ninth Division, after the conclusion of the anti-rebellion army last year, moved his troops to Luoyang Xigong and immediately engaged in training. He successively established military and sergeant companies and officer education classes to improve the skills and knowledge of the soldiers. Now, he is planning to establish a full-division clubhouse to provide soldiers with a legitimate entertainment after class. Therefore, he specially sent two commissioners, Shen Jingxuan and Li Ziying, to Shanghai yesterday to purchase equipment. It is scheduled to purchase everything within three days and transport it to the west by freight car.</p>
<p>The General Manager of the Asia Command Foreign Firm Returned Home The staff hosted a banquet to bid farewell to Mr. Ma Si, the General Manager of the Asia Command Foreign Firm, who will return home at the end of this month. Chinese and foreign employees hosted a banquet at the Xinxin Restaurant on Nanjing Road yesterday to bid him farewell. The scene was lively.</p>

<h3>The Detained Lei Shuai Released</h3>
<p>The sealed house is permitted to be unsealed, and the maidservant is also permitted to be returned to her master. Su Shaotang, who was engaged in the business of camp property and also did brokerage business, was kidnapped twice last winter, and was rescued from the bandits' den by the police. The arrested bandits were repeatedly interrogated by the Special District Court, and those who were found to be innocent were released. This has been reported in previous newspapers. Among the people arrested at that time were Lei Shuai and his mother, sisters, male and female servants, etc. The house at 414 Route Lafayette in the French Concession where they lived was also temporarily sealed by the Special Court. Now that Lei Shuai and others have been found innocent after interrogation, their residence is naturally not a bandits' den. Therefore, after Lei was released, he immediately hired lawyer Osen to submit a petition to the Special Court requesting the unsealing of the house and the return of the eleven-year-old maidservant Fu Yu, who was temporarily detained in the Jiliu Place. This has now been approved by Judge Zhou, who is hearing the case.</p>

<h3>A Robbery on the Road; Two Bandits Apprehended</h3>
<p>At around 3:30 am yesterday, a man was walking along the Bund when he was suddenly approached by several bandits who robbed him. He was robbed of 45 yuan in silver dollars and the bandits fled.

The police also fired back. Finally, two bandits were arrested and apprehended.</p>
<h3>A Robbery on Fangbang Road Last Night</h3>
<p>A bandit apprehended by patrol police. At 7:20 pm last night, Li Gentao, a local resident of No. 23 Lianqing Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, was having dinner at home when five bandits suddenly broke in through the main door. One was wearing a coffee-colored camel hair robe and a felt hat, one was wearing a gray serge robe with a vest, and two were wearing yuan-colored long robes and black short clothes. They spoke in the Jiang dialect and the local dialect. Two bandits held pistols and threatened them to remain silent. They arbitrarily searched the house for about twenty minutes before carrying their loot and trying to escape through the main door. They were robbed of 339 yuan in silver dollars, 100 yuan in paper money, a pair of gold earrings, and a pair of silver bracelets. The bandits were escaping from Yiqing Street towards Jinjiafang. The victim had already tracked them and was following closely behind them. He chased them directly to the vicinity of Honglan Bridge. There, he met Police Officer Wang Yucai of the 30th post of the second sub-district of Shenxiangge. The victim went forward to report the incident. According to the report, the police officer immediately raised his gun and chased after the bandits. When he reached the entrance of Kongjia Lane, he met Police Officer Wang Qing of the 31st post, who joined the chase. One of the bandits, wearing a gray serge robe and yuan-colored vest, was about to draw his gun and fire when the police officers snatched the gun. He was immediately captured. The police officers were still planning to continue chasing the bandits, but the bandit wearing the coffee-colored robe drew his gun and fired a shot at the two police officers. The police officers also raised their guns and fired back, but neither shot hit. At that time, fearing that there were many pedestrians on the road and that innocent people might be injured, and because there were few police officers and many bandits, and because one of the bandits had been captured, they did not pursue them thoroughly, allowing some to escape. The police officers then took the suspect to the station. After a strict interrogation by Director Xu, the bandit confessed his name as Chen Tianhai, 25 years old, from Nanjing. The gun seized was a 6-inch Browning pistol, No. 92996, with a bullet already chambered, fortunately not fired. The suspect admitted to organizing the robbery of the Li family and successively confessed the addresses where his accomplices were hiding. Director Xu then sent more senior police officers to arrest them and telegraphed the bureau chief to await verification and handling.</p>
<h3>A Woman Robbed of Mutual Aid Society Money</h3>
<p>One bandit has been apprehended. A woman from Ningbo, Wang Zhou, went to No. 3 Avenue Eugène-Vallon on the evening of November 8 last year to participate in a mutual aid society and won a prize of 66 yuan, which she put in her pocket and returned home. Just as she reached the entrance of Puai Lane, she was suddenly surrounded by four bandits. One bandit held a pistol, and the other bandits searched her and robbed her of all the mutual aid society money. It was not until recently that Detective Sun Yunqing of the Harbin Police apprehended a bandit named Bao Binghua, who was from the same village as the woman. He was sent to the Special District Court yesterday morning. According to Bao, the woman's husband, Wang Shun, held a mutual aid society. I had won 50 copper coins, and I should have received a prize of 45 yuan, but Wang tried to deny it and insulted me, so he falsely accused me of robbing the mutual aid society money as revenge. However, Wang Zhou insisted that she was indeed robbed by a group of bandits led by Bao. Judge Feng postponed the trial of the defendant for further investigation and interrogation because the two sides had conflicting statements.</p>
