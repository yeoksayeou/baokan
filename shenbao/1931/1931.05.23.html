<p>— 蒲滄</p>
<p>威海衛路中。美輪美奐之新建築爲何。此海上中堅分子所組織之中社是也。疇昔之夜。密雪根大學同學會曾假此作聨歡之舉。雖天不做美。風雨迷漫。而仍有羣賢畢至少長咸集之盛。是烏可以無紀。是夜也。凡驅車過中社門首者。莫不見有附英文註釋之篆文榜書。飄蕩於風雨之中。其文曰密雪根大學春季大會。而註釋則爲ADay　of　Wolverines　in,China蓋Wolevrine者。一種貪食之獸名。爲北美密雪根聨邦之特産，因是該邦人士。亦咸用此爲别名。於運動會中或球類比賽時習用之。海上固未之前見也。中社建築精雅。陳設尤合美術化。汪亞塵滯法撫古之作。陳列極多。國畫方面。有前寒之友畫會舊作多幀。如經頣淵之竹石。陳樹人之花鳥。何香凝之梅華。李秋君李祖韓之靑綠。及鄭午昌錢瘦鐵之水墨。皆一時傑出者也。銀燈初放。陳霆銳即携其幼子以俱來。未幾。男女同學已絡繹而至。Bring　in　Husband　and　Wiie者。頗不乏人。外藉同學蒞會者。有美國總領事克銀漢E　S　Cunningbam美國法庭在華檢察官薩賚德Dr,Sellet。日本駐華商務參贊乾精末及聖約翰敎授沙利文P，B，Sullivan等。鐘鳴七下。由陳霆銳主席宣告就席。席列U字形。而席面以黄藍二色紙帶。範成M字形。不啻一極自然之校徽U　of　M也。吳經熊最後至。對於此種利用實施美術之點。稱道不絶口。主席致開會辭後首由克銀漢演說。當其起立時。衆咸注視。繼以歡呼。賀其老當益壯已中首選矣。蓋秩序中有年齡測騐一種餘興。到會年齒之最長與最稚者。均有奬品。最長者得余雪楊所畫黄金果四尺立軸一幀。。最稚者得糖果。亦爲余雪楊所贈。克銀漢畢業密校。遠在二十年前。雖無龍鍾老態。而一種金鬢霜斑。頂髮盡秃者。早已告人以春秋之高絶儕輩也。演辭多關掌故。可作研究美國開發史之參考。蓋密雪根位於東西美之間。天産極富。當時東部至西部非常困難。有似中國之至美國然。今日西美之有此繁華者。密校之功爲多。並謂著稱於歐戰時之美艦S，S，Hounston。現泊滬濱。擬柬邀同學前往登臨云。次爲薩賚德演說語極詼諧。謂見有曩日曾問業者同席。故雖不能比克銀漢之爲第一代。亦不失其爲第二代。於是衆又莞爾者久之。有呼「三代見面盛會盛會。」又述密校同學。近年政治貢獻甚偉。如柯立芝總統時代。内閣閣員多至四人云云。繼其後而演說者。爲沙利文。氏擅運動。尤長籃球。故能於密校一年中各項運動。如田徑賽·足球·籃球·棒球·室内運動·氷上競技·及泅泳等之奪取錦標情形。作有系統報告。有條不紊。如數家珍。惟最近有不少兄弟會中·因違背酒禁而科罰者甚多。亦一趣譚耳。末爲吳經熊演說。以極有趣之笑話出之。不惜自比木蛙。以調濟羣衆心理。而博得鬨堂大笑。可謂善於詞令矣。隨即通過簡立。選舉職員。席次並有天廚·五洲·維乙·中央各廠。贈送之味精·香皂·良丹·及辣醬油等。到會者。咸得滿載而言歸。</p>

<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>休沐日。得半日閒。造訪孟容。是時適爲八句半鐘。而孟容已工作多時。女弟子朱屺瞻夫人馬女士。請其改稿。亦早在矣。圖爲杜鵑等三幅。筆法確肖孟容。不類巾幗手筆。聞習畫祇半載。而成績已可觀邀孟容。作兆豐公園之游。　是日。朱君邀孟容。作兆豐公園之游。馬女士畫稿旣改竣。先行。謂以車來迎。孟容爲余作柳燕圖。老柳婆娑。乳燕飛舞。寫景之妙。直到毫巓。忽見壁間張有異魚圖一幅。寫奇特之魚若干尾。神情活躍。令人作濠上想。昔時趙撝叔曾有斯作。孟容無多讓焉。孟容著有「墨趣」。專述用墨如用色。妙趣環生。可爲圭臬。「草蟲魚蟹譜。」一、寫形。二、寫神。三、寫意。以直爲基礎。以美爲究意。二書發行。造福後學。豈淺鮮哉。</p>
<p>朱君車來。相偕同往。車中尙有金啓靜女士。與孟容談本屆中日畫會事。興致極濃。車行至速。瞬息即達。入門。芬芳之氣。撲我鼻觀。幾爲陶醉。笑謂孟容曰。吾人日處塵囂。埋頭工作。正不知何時爲春。何時爲夏。第知冷暖之有别。初無大異。今觀此大好園林。樹木蓊鬱。花草妍蒨。始知繁囂塡耳之春申江上。尙有若是之洞天福地也。孟容爲之莞爾。游者以西人爲多。三三兩兩。子女成行。有攝影者。有放船者。（玩具之小帆船。放入池中。緩緩而行。極爲有味。）於濃綠樹叢中。見一西婦。手持童話。旁有兒童四五人。環而靜聽伊之演述。西人家庭敎育之認顚。於斯可見。以觀吾國婦女挈其子女。專以游園取樂者。大相懸殊矣。又有西童四人。作礕凶逆克之舉。相敬如賓。秩然有禮。凡此種種。俱可法也。至動物園。孟容速寫蒼鷹。正怒目張爪示其兇猛。寫鸚鵡亦頗肖。此鳥本以能言著。時正呼哈羅哈羅之聲也。復寫其他異鳥數種。寫至一松鼠。咸詫奇特。蓋一鼠之身。有黄藍白黑廟色。造物之奇。誠令人莫測焉　出動物園。依徑緩行。縱觀園中異草奇花。花事已過。特種月季。高與人齊。色作淡黄。而花瓣零落。間有含苞欲吐者。蓋亦少矣。柳葉毶毶。不復有纖麗之態。池中睡蓮。方顯其潔白之姿。春之來也。余未之見春之將去。余竟得觀。誦板橋道人菩薩蠻詞。「留春不住由春去。春歸畢竟歸何處。明歲早些來。烟花待翦栽。雪消春又到。春到人偏老。切莫怨東風。東風正怨儂。」不禁有感。爰作送春小記。並質諸孟容屺瞻。以爲何如。</p>

<p>邇來唱片事業。風起雲湧。各聘戲劇專門人才任接洽收音及排戲之責。各公司銷路最廣者當首推梅（蘭芳）余（叔岩）所灌諸片。惟以前所灌多爲個人單唱。久之亦覺乏味。去歲勝利公司特延徐慕雲君担任該項職務。以謀進展。徐君與南北各伶素多交往。適蘭芳富英等其時亦均奏藝滬上。故略經接洽後。即行定議。計共灌販馬記。楊貴妃。起解。敎子。羣英會珠簾寨等數片。以上諸片現已製就發售。余昨曾購得一套（七張）。販馬記係梅與妙香合唱之寫狀一段。起解係梅蕭（長華）對口之躦路一段。楊貴妃係梅姜對口之高力士報警一段。敎子一面係南梆子。一面反西皮。雖均蘭芳獨唱。但所編新腔。倍極婉妙。而旦角之有反西皮。亦自蘭芳之是片始。至蕭姜合唱之羣英會。富英父子對口之珠簾寨。亦均精警異常。並各附新頴精美之戲考。以增興趣云。</p>

<p>五日晨車抵釜山。釜山位於朝鮮半島之東南端。隔對馬海峽。爲日本之馬關。舟行七八小時可達。有聨絡船運貨載客甚便。</p>
<p>釜山領事署背山臨海。花木清幽。狠可愛。惜館屋失修。不惟居者危險。亦且有關國體。領事陳君正甫等導登龍頭山。全市在目。</p>
<p>釜山爲海陸百貨南向輸出人的總滙。在全鮮商港中居第一位。慶尙南道廳在此。人口十一萬六千餘。而日本人倒有四萬二千餘。竟占三分之一以上。前文說日本移本國民於南鮮。這是一個證據。</p>
<p>晚由馬關上車赴東京。車行二十小時。道旁所見。無一片曠土。不必說。所過村落。四圍花木。整潔中更有美感。沿途廣告。有最多的一類。深刺我眼簾的。就是化學工業。只見某化學工塲。某化學工塲。連綿不斷。</p>
<p>三等車這班没有寢臺男女老幼滿滿地幾百人危坐了一夜。無高談狂笑聲。無咳嗽聲。秩序好極了。車僕每一二小時。必來洒掃一次。所見警察。憲兵。兵士。驛長。車掌。賣票役。檢票役。車僕。乃至種種小販兒童。没一個不是恭恭敬敬。盡其職事。他們對乘客的尊重有禮。與乘客對他們的相當禮貌。可稱雙絶。彷彿進了一個規人家。上有嚴師嚴父。做子弟的絶對不敢放肆。我遊日本第五次。已司空慣見了。同行諸友之初次來遊者。尤爲騖歎呌絶。</p>
<p>沿途櫻花已怒開。但山頂積雪猶未融解。成一詩。</p>
<p>山陽道中</p>
<p>朝撫龍頭山頂松。夜發馬關車掩篷。危襟密坐遣遙夕。月明千里飛無跡。天人之際徵可觀。海　　國春深猶勒寒。山下櫻花山上雪。紅妝白髮耐人看。</p>

<p>— 程小靑</p>
<p>我移轉目光。停睛一瞧。也是一個華人。穿着一件黑色的長袍。身材非常高大。這人偶然回過臉來。我才認識他就是那個可恨而又可憐的邱奎。我正要發出那句「他怎麽也在這裏」的問句。霍桑忽又低低的說道。「你且别問。現在你試再運用你的目光。瞧瞧這廣室左邊的外角。可也有認識的人麽。」我果眞依着他的指示。遠遠的瞧去。見那左面向外的角上。也有兩個本國的食客。那是一男一女。女的穿着一件淺黄色的旗袍。衣角上還繡着黑色的蝴蝶。滿頭鬈髮。蓬鬆得異乎尋常。這樣的裝束。在那時候原是上海最流行的。伊的面貌也很漂亮。這時正低着頭。和伊對面的男子說笑。那男的穿着栗　色的西裝。光亮的頭髮。向後梳得非常齊整。斜側着臉。凑着那女子。臉上含着一種媚笑。我再仔細一瞧。他的鼻子是鈎形的。眼睛是稜角的。不由的不使我震了一震。我低聲向霍桑道。「這就是車時傑麽。」霍桑向我貶了眨眼。答道。「你何必呌名喚姓。」我一時怒氣攻心。不期然而然的把我的座椅移開了些。準備起立。霍桑又說道。「你打算怎麽樣。可是要動手麽。我勸你鎭靜些兒。再想想你自己的地位。」我雖然被霍桑的話止住了。我的忿怒仍不能遏制。恨不得立時奔上前去。在這惡漢的臉上痛快的摑他幾下。霍桑又低低的向我道。「你且平一平氣。再瞧瞧他們。」我横過臉去。又瞧見一種特異的舉動。那陰謀的少年正摸出了一隻小小的紫羅蘭色的絨匣。嘻皮笑臉的遞給他對面的女伴。那女的把絨匣開了。仔細瞧了一瞧。臉上又露出一種含着誘惑的巧笑。我忽聽得霍桑自言自語的說道。「這大槪是一枚指環。連那絨匣計算。總也值兩三塊錢。」我明知我們先前的料想已經證實。這惡少果眞在利用了僞飾欺騙那女子哩。我還没有接嘴。忽見那隔座的邱奎。旋過頭來向霍桑問話。他道。「你呌我來。到底幹什麽事呀。」霍桑也側了些身子答道。「據你自己說。那晚上的奸徒。你並不和他串同。那麽。你如果瞧見了他。你又怎樣對付他呢。」</p>

<p>書報介紹前鋒月刊  高偉　　第四期　現代書局出版　　這期的『前鋒月刋、』正如第三期編者所預告的、進一步轉向而着重於小說了、計有四篇短篇創作、『砲台的防禦者』『老金』『馬蘭小姐』及『盜寳器的牧師、』在這四篇的量中、表現出每篇不同的性格和風味、　　穆羅茶先生向來是慣於運用輕逸的筆調來描寫人生某一部份事故的　、但有他的特徵、就是那些事故實爲通常人的、當讀了以後、會本能地想到『這不要是在刻薄着我呵、』這篇『砲台的防禦者、』在題材上眞是别創一風、而描寫的手腕也眞老到、其主要的意旨、可以把結尾這幾句話以槪括、『……當然、我也曉得、一切人爲的日常生活、其中必定有一種很簡單、很明白的信條、以資宣傳、否則這一個世界就决不會被支配得這樣合式、而一個個人類的集團生活也就不能夠繼續下去、所以我們看人們啊、因此他們才是、對於將來只有一個個達不到希望的夢想對於過去所遺留下來的一切、不得不給它以一部份一部份的遺忘、凡有對於現在人類才曉得了一刹那生活折眞實性、現在、歷史使我們對於過去永遠不會忘却的紀錄是些什麽呢、依我看來、只有一種砲台的防禦者而已、』作者從描寫一個生活於上海大都會的何一得、應朋友之召於咖啡座談起、完全以何一得的日常生活來反映和表達所謂『砲台的防禦者』的典型性、同時再襯托着朋友們的生活情况、而完成了這篇創作、在這裏、我們可以探到一種時代的轉換形態、就是家庭制度的問題、　　『魏太對於砲台所指定的範圍（如一家人爲代表）的確是對的、不過砲台的範圍即使就他所指定着的、到現在也大有變化了、爲了這一層理由、我們就應該去曉得近來中國的大家庭正在一天一天地潰崩、是的、大多類靑年男女一大羣一大羣地從内地各處的大家庭裏面走了出來、到最後、他們一個個都走進了大都會的亭子間裏面去住着、尤其是上海、吸收了這樣的靑年男女、比别的大城市還要多、到現在、中國的大家庭已經失去了以前的力量、正好像在吳淞地方的砲台、在中國的國防上是甚爲脆弱的防禦物一樣、……他現在的家庭只有他的一位老婆、還有他的四位女兒、他對於他們五個人恰好是一個砲台的防禦者、在他一生之中、他有不得不去努力一番的責任、　　這當然是指一般而說、中國目前的社會、是處於上不應下、單以那些住亭子間的靑年男女而說該怎樣適而冀都市與内地相均匀、大家庭制度無形地顯明地指不着無論社會組織是如何、但個人决不能脫離社會而生存、同時個人又是團體的一員、他生存在團體之中、就應該爲集團而努力、盡他在團體的一員的責任、作者借談話而發出這樣的警句『……每一個人到了三十五歲之後、都應該爲多數人類的幸福而去做一番事業、我是中國人、我曉得中國的民間、在世界上是最多數的受苦羣衆、我們如果要救人類、走進中國的民間去工作、就儘夠你忙碌了、大同世界、我是不相信的、爲我們中華民族努力、我想不見得是落空的吧、』從而、我們可知道、『砲台的防禦者』題材的用意之深刻了、　　蘇靈君本期發表了兩篇創作、『老金』和『馬蘭上姐』、作者以敏捷的筆緻、來捉住這兩個題材、但在機構上、很明顯的可看出是出自一人的、不過前者似較勝、『老金』是寫一個處於當軍閥戰敗下來的小市鎭上的故事、市面給鬧得不成樣了、但住在城東的老王却並不害怕、因爲『老王這老頭子、是聰敏不過了、他首先得了宋團長的歡心、在家設起幾張烟榻來、並且呌自己的小老婆去伴宋團長睡覺、』同樣、『在李寡婦家却也是並不見懼怕什麽災難、災難到了她家却變成了幸福了、李寡婦自己每夜都是和着一　個連長睡覺、—這實在是很好的交易、連長隊長們、就是兵士們、他們都常帶很多金錢手飾來家、』於是引起了老金的眼紅、便也勾誘自己的老婆也去幹這勾當、到也好的、他的老婆雖感覺到這該多麽羞辱的事、然而爲了要發意外的財、也是可慰的了、於是就接上生意了、但老金却又覺非常　不妥、老婆接了客人、那末自己算是什麽呢、當妻子問他要否向連長說說弄個差使時、豈知老金却說、『我們寗得餓死吧、你也得立刻拒絶他們再來了、』但妻子却不能了、但却有好的消息傳給老金、就是革命軍快到、畢竟使他引起了濃厚的興趣與希望的欣躍、他乘機把正酣睡在妻子旁邊的連長刺死了、並且向妻子說、『……我們的出頭日子到了、我、我已經自己做了革命黨的便衣隊了、在一點鐘内、你看我用這支手槍去結果那宋團長、……你在家裏等着去領我的屍首、』這時的老金已是多麽勇敢的老金呵、在技巧上、這篇是很成熟的、『馬蘭小姐』是寫敎會的神父引誘無辜的少女而發生的一幕慘劇、暴露了仁慈外貌的神父的獰惡面目、　　易康的『盜寳器的牧師、』似乎叙述得太形平淡了、不能引熱烈的反感、這是寫在西康的牧師想深入蠻地探險、結果却一無生還、　　兩篇短篇譯作、李靑崖譯莫泊桑的『未龍老丈』和王宣化譯傑克倫敦的『無忌、』民族色彩非常濃裂、未龍老丈是爲仇恨普軍佔領法境而進行暗殺、結果犧牲了、在初看他、是十分平凡的人、然竟做出這樣驚人的事來、當被普軍捉住詰審時、他毫不遲疑地承諾、而且乾脆地等待受刑、更使我們肅然起敬、無忌是爲白人所壓迫着的黑人、但最後却將白人的統治推翻、並且被推爲馬來達族中最有權力的領袖了、這種被壓迫弱小民族的反抗、在『不平則鳴』的原則下、實是無法避免的吧、　　現在談到論著方面來了、鄭行巽的『剩餘價值論評的發端』此期是續完了、我們知道、自馬克斯的學說傳授到中國來、很都人是祇知道一味恭維的、以嚴正的態度來從事批判的、在國内確乎甚少見、鄭先生在這裏捉住了馬克斯的生平學術上的最大貢獻—剩餘價值論、下以批判的定評、這種巨大的工程、眞是值得欣喜的、在上二期發表了此文後、即引起全國學術界的注意、彷彿又呈活躍的氣象了、全文計共十節、討論頗爲詳盡、本期乃六至十節、對於科學管理、變性資本、剩餘價值率物剩餘價值量的計算的公式、及馬克斯未有主張實業領袖也能創造新的價值的矛盾等問題、『均有相當發揮、作者的結論、認爲馬克斯的剩餘價雖非政治的、而是學理的、但此種學理駁雜不純、即是不健全的、年來、馬克斯自己以爲他的價值法則祇適用於資本制生産方法的時代、奈事實竟相反、不過、歸結起來、我們也應得知道、『馬克斯創立剩餘價值論的本意、乃是在暴露資本家掠奪的罪惡的眞相、—如果此種掠奪的罪惡是當眞有的嗎—也是爲全社會的福利着想、並非是存心搗亂、以誤盡天下蒼生、不過、因爲他滿腔都壞着孤憤、所以、其所形之於言辭者、就不免於純理性的推論之中參雜有感情作用的成分在内、……』因之、馬克斯的學說是始終脫不了病態的發展啊、最後討論到中國經濟現象、和馬克斯的剩餘價值論有無若何關係、則因根本上中國經濟現象家與歐洲經濟現象發生異趣、在歐洲尙不能適用、妄論中國了、而且關於農工商業的發展、亦自有中國傳統的均富精神足資利用的、進言之、自有國家的經濟政策來維繫了的、其次、應認識各國的經濟現象、是具有特性、决難張冠李戴、所以當我們談到中國經濟問題的時候、當然不能忘却中國的民族精神了、換句話說、要求中國的經濟組織健全的方略之運用、應以適用於中國特殊經濟狀况爲主、以解决民生問題、這纔是一件極偉大的而且最有功效的事業、　　谷劍塵的『怎樣去幹民族主義的民衆劇運動』、在民衆劇運動的理論建設上、是很有力的、作者認清了『民衆的休閒敎育』中最有力量的、該揚戲劇、但從戲劇形態的發展中、因完全是屬於民衆的啊、同時苟站在民衆運動的立塲、中國的民衆運動是向來以民族主義爲根本的、則民衆劇當然亦以民族主義爲基礎觀念了、但尙有一個嚴重問題、就是所謂戲劇、民衆眞能接受了嗎、因爲戲劇藝術的了解是與民衆的智識程度是很有關係的、也許我們在舞台技巧上所告訴他們的東</p>

<p>Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction without Exchange Conditions; Exchange of Ratifications for the Sino-Polish Treaty of Commerce</p>
<p>Nanjing: Foreign Minister Wang met with journalists at 11:00 AM on the 22nd and reported on the following: (1) The request to abolish consular jurisdiction is extremely reasonable. Some countries may consider this a vested right, and require conditions of exchange if it is abandoned. This is simply impossible. Since our request is to restore inherent sovereignty, the National Government has absolutely no need to discuss conditions of exchange with any country. (2) The Sino-Polish Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation has been passed by the Legislative Yuan and sent to the government for approval. The two sides will soon exchange ratifications. (3) The Sino-Soviet Conference is progressing quite closely. The National Government is quite willing to resolve all outstanding issues between the two countries. (4) The Dutch Ambassador Oudendijk has resigned and has left Beiping to come to Nanjing to say goodbye. Although Ambassador Oudendijk served as the leader of the diplomatic corps during the Beiyang Government, he was personally a good friend of China. Ambassador Oudendijk contributed greatly to the matter of China and the Netherlands abolishing consular jurisdiction. (5) Significant progress has been made on the issue of reorganizing the Shanghai French Concession. It will be completely recovered in a short period of time and reorganized into a Chinese court. Its organization will be roughly the same as the existing courts in the Public Concession. (6) On May 18th, the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dalton Stans replied to questions in the House of Commons, stating that the Yunnan provincial government has captured several suspects in the case of the murder of two female missionaries in Yunnan and is currently interrogating them strictly. (7) Currently, some countries have inquired about the issue of free residence for foreigners in China. This matter must be completely resolved after all unequal treaties are abolished and equal and reciprocal treaties are signed, such as concessions, leased territories, and foreign troops stationed in China. Then the Chinese government can allow foreigners to reside freely in China in accordance with Chinese law. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Contradictory Phenomena <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The launch ceremony of the German 10,000-ton battleship was met with national fervor, indicating that although Germany has been subjected to various restrictions after the war, its strength is still sufficient to maintain its national glory. The large-scale operation of 700 American aircraft, an ideal attack, also indicates that the US Air Force has extremely good value in warfare. These demonstration actions are largely contradictory to the principle of advocating peace and advocating military reduction on weekdays. The representatives at the European League meetings all spoke of seeking international cooperation to save the economic crisis, but in reality, they each had plans to either undermine others' combinations or oppress others' development in order to exclusively control the European economy. This is largely contradictory to the principle of cooperation. Looking again at the world's economic downturn, which is becoming increasingly pervasive, the unemployment problem is becoming increasingly serious, and the strike movement is becoming even more uncontrollable. However, countries are still trying to expand their power abroad, sparing no expense to collect money to expand their military preparations, increasing the military expenditure of the army and navy as much as possible, and updating the shipbuilding program as much as possible. The national strength is even more obviously contradictory to the actions of its government. For example, the people's financial resources are becoming increasingly scarce on one side of society, while the desire for luxury is increasing on the other side. This phenomenon is really not the blessing of society. Therefore, if the world's great contradictions are not awakened and efforts are made to eliminate them, then what is currently seen as only contradictions will inevitably break down due to these contradictions in the future.</p>

It is reported that the authorities have arrested twenty leaders of the revolutionary party. According to a telegram from US naval officers to Washington, revolutionary unrest has broken out in southern Cuba, with unusually active party members near Guantanamo Bay. The leaders of the revolutionary party declared that President Machado's term has expired and that he has illegally amended the constitution to obtain another four years. Such illegal actions are intolerable and a new election must be held in accordance with the law. It is reported that there is an anti-government party called the Nationalist Party, which the authorities do not recognize. The current incident is caused by this.

It is appropriate to unite the strength of our party to remove obstacles to the revolution, to comfort the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in heaven, and to live up to the expectations of the masses. Unexpectedly, in recent days, rumors have flourished, and distant reports cause great anxiety. If there are misunderstandings, it would be reckless to provoke conflict and stand by while the Red bandits grow in power and cause harm, externally inviting foreign aggression. Who will resist the insult? Like fighting clams and herons, only the fisherman benefits. Learning from past mistakes, can we not feel heartache? How can fellow revolutionaries tolerate this? Moreover, with the imminent promulgation of the provisional constitution, all disputes can be resolved easily. It is hoped that prejudices can be eliminated, emotions can be restrained, and calmness can be maintained while waiting for a resolution. Prevent the instigation of politicians, and prioritize the overall situation. Unite from top to bottom to jointly plan national affairs, realize the Three Principles of the People, and abolish unequal treaties. The future of the Party and the nation deeply depends on this. We express our sincere thoughts and hope for your wise consideration." We hope that the people of the nation will unanimously uphold righteous arguments, promote harmony, and greatly benefit the Party and the nation.

<p>Central Government Promises One Million in Military Funds</p>
<p>Military, Civil, and Financial Issues All Have Solutions</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Shanxi Provincial Government Chairman Shang Zhen, along with Luo Chengwei, director of the Hebei Unified Tax Office, who came to inspect the unified tax situation, and Jin Zunhua, deputy division commander of Sun Dianying's troops, Hu Yiling, member of the provincial government, and more than ten others, arrived in Taiyuan yesterday (the 18th) at 4:00 PM by Zhengtai express train. Many Shanxi military and political leaders came to the station to welcome them. After getting off the train, Shang Zhen briefly exchanged greetings with the welcomers and then went directly to his private residence in West Xiaoqiang by car. According to Shang's conversation with reporters, he said, "Today, I came with Hu Yiling, Luo Chengwei, and more than ten others. After Hu Yiling returns, the Public Security Management Office will be established. Luo came to investigate Shanxi's unified tax affairs. Commander Song Zheyuan will also return within a day or two. Commander Xu Cichen is under doctor's orders to rest and will not be able to return to his post for three or four weeks. Today, a special train brought two million silver dollars, one million for compilation expenses, six hundred thousand for cigarette unified tax funds, and four hundred thousand for the Shanxi Provincial Bank's deposits in Tianjin. The arrears of compilation expenses for various departments will be released soon. The lottery for the five-month period is planned to be discussed at a meeting tomorrow. If there is still no better solution, it will continue. As for the guest troops' salaries, the central government has been allocating them monthly since May, which should reduce the burden on various localities in this province. The previous request to the central government to restore the reorganization of Shanxi financial bonds has recently been addressed in a telegram from Vice Chairman Zhang, stating that he has negotiated with Minister Song and agreed to restore it. We will send personnel to Beijing in the next few days to formally negotiate, and we expect to achieve the goal. In short, concrete solutions have been planned for the military, political, civil, and financial affairs of this province, and the difficult situation in Shanxi has been overcome as a whole," and so on. Attached is the text of the telegram from Vice Commander Zhang from Beijing to Shang, as follows: "Limited to immediate arrival, Taiyuan Beiping Exploration, Chairman Shang Qi Yu brother Jian, Regarding the Shanxi military's salaries and the shortfall in income from Shanxi-Suiyuan, Commander-in-Chief Jiang has agreed to allocate about one million yuan per month. As for financial bonds, I have discussed it with Minister Song and hope you will send personnel with a plan to Beijing to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance and carry out everything. Please also inform all officers and soldiers of the above two items. Zhang Xueliang Deputy Commander," (May 19th)</p>

<p>Denies Leading Troops to Jiangxi to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu, who went to Beijing on the second of this month with Provincial Committee Member Zhang Yue to attend the National Conference, returned north by special train from Pukou early on the 19th. He passed Xuzhou at 8:20 PM that night and arrived at Nanshahe Station south of Tengxian, and because it was already late at night, he stopped there. This morning (the 20th) at 5:00 AM, he headed north and when arriving in Tengxian, the Chief of Staff of Tengxian, Liu Shuxiang, and the Commander of the 20th Division, Gu Liangmin, boarded the train to report on the encirclement and suppression of the bandit gangs in Baodu Mountain. At 8:30 AM, he passed Yanzhou and arrived in the province at noon. Han gave a speech in the car, stating that reports saying that he would lead troops to Jiangxi to suppress bandits were completely unfounded and that he had heard nothing of the matter. Someone had also asked about this when he arrived in Xuzhou, and it was likely a rumor. The most important case passed by this National Conference was the provisional constitution, followed by many cases concerning the development of the Northwest. No special cases were passed regarding Shandong. The Baodu Mountain bandit gangs are already no longer a problem, but Guo Mafeng has led a crowd of two or three hundred back to Mengshan, and they are currently being pursued, and so on. After finishing the speech, Han went to the Provincial Government by car, and Provincial Committee Member Zhang Yue and Councilor Wu Bairui also came along. (20th)</p>

<h3 id="e93">Qin and Han Bricks and Tiles Sold to Japanese Again <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Transported to Qingdao and Detained</p>
<p>Provincial Library Urgently Seeks to Rescue Them</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Recently, news of the loss of Shandong antiquities has been constantly reported. The Haiyuan Pavilion Library of the Yang family in Liaocheng was destroyed and sold previously, and the Tibetan scriptures of the Hainan Temple in Yexian were destroyed later, which are truly major misfortunes for Shandong's culture. Unexpectedly, one wave subsides, and another rises. The Haiyuan Pavilion Library was sold to the Japanese and is about to flow into a foreign country. Now, seven or eight hundred Qin and Han bricks and tiles collected by the Gao family in Weixian have been sold to the Japanese. It is extremely distressing. Fortunately, the pottery was transported to Qingdao by the Japanese and detained and inspected by the station there. The Shandong Provincial Library has sent letters to various agencies in Qingdao, stating that these bricks and tiles are the essence of ancient bricks and tiles of all of China and requesting their detention to jointly discuss proper methods of preservation. At the same time, it has requested the Shandong Department of Education to immediately telegraph the Qingdao Municipal Government and the Jiaoji Railway Administration to handle everything. The details of this case are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e94">History of Bricks and Tiles <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, there was a Gao Qingling in Weixian who was a preserver of antiquities. He collected about seven or eight hundred Qin and Han bricks and tiles, all of which were unique masterpieces and the essence of ancient bricks and tiles in the country. Gao believed that these bricks and tiles were valuable and precious, and he wrote a special book, "Wen Xun of Shangtao Studio Bricks and Tiles," which recorded the matter in detail, totaling twenty-four large volumes, all of which were rubbings. About two feet long and eight inches wide, the Shandong Library purchased a copy for 250 yuan, and the value of the bricks and tiles is truly no different from the Jade of Liancheng.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Sold to Japanese <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Recently, two or three days ago, the descendants of Gao Qingling were unable to inherit their ancestors' legacy and sold all of these Qin and Han bricks and tiles to the Japanese. Yesterday, the Japanese packed these bricks and tiles into more than fifty large boxes and transported them out of Weixian. When they arrived in Qingdao, the Qingdao Station of the Jiaoji Railway detained them for inspection, but few people recognize the value of these bricks and tiles, so it is still unknown whether they will be shipped out now.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Urgently Seeking Rescue <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Shandong Provincial Library, upon receiving this news, believed that the matter concerned the pottery culture and history of China and could not allow it to fall into foreign hands. Therefore, the library sent separate urgent letters to the Qingdao Municipal Government, the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee, the Bureau of Education, and the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that these bricks and tiles were of great importance and requested that they be detained and preserved according to the Law on the Preservation of Antiquities. At the same time, it reported to the Department of Education and requested that it telegraph the Qingdao Municipal Government and the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee to detain these bricks and tiles. The Shandong Library wrote to the Qingdao Municipal Government, etc., stating, "To whom it may concern, the large number of bricks and tiles collected by the Gao family in Weixian are the only national treasures among the pottery in the country. There is a special book named 'Wen Xun of Shangtao Studio Bricks and Tiles,' which is well-known in academic circles. We have recently heard that a national of a certain country has bought them and is about to export them to Qingdao. This matter concerns the pottery culture of the entire nation, and we dare not remain silent. Please investigate and seize them in accordance with the Law on the Preservation of Antiquities promulgated by the National Government and preserve them for the public. We would be most grateful."

<h3 id="e97">News of Reorganization of Hubei Provincial Government <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Wuhan Municipal Government to Merge with Provincial Government</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Provincial Government, since its establishment last year, has been unable to support its military and political expenses due to the abolition of likin and the sharp decline in tax revenue. On the other hand, Hankou's income has exceeded the provincial tax revenue, and the idea of merging the province and the city has become quite popular. Recently, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, He Chengjun, and the Mayor of Hankou, Liu Wendao, went to Beijing one after another to report the administrative situation to Chairman Jiang. As a result, the issue of a partial reorganization of the provincial government and the abolition of the municipal government has arisen due to the merging of the province and city. The Provincial Government Committee consists of nine members: Chairman He Chengjun, who concurrently serves as Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wu Xingya, who concurrently serves as Director of the Department of Finance, Zhang Guanshi, who concurrently serves as Director of the Department of Construction, Fang Dazhi, who concurrently serves as Director of the Department of Education, Huang Jianzhong, who concurrently serves as Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, Peng Jieshi, Committee members Chen Guangzu, Xiong Bingkun, and Xie Lü, etc. On the municipal government side, the Secretary-General is He Fuzhou, the Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs is Yang Zaichun, the Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities is Huang Zhenxing, the Director of the Bureau of Finance is Wu Guozhen, the Director of the Bureau of Education is Liu Wendao, and the Director of the Bureau of Public Works is Chen Keming, etc. After the merging of the province and city, the issue of who will stay and who will go has become a major concern. It is rumored that the new provincial government will still be headed by He Chengjun as chairman, Liu Wendao as Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Wu Guozhen as Director of the Department of Finance. The Departments of Construction and Education will remain unchanged. The Hankou Municipal Government will be reorganized into an ordinary city directly under the provincial government, and the position of mayor will be selected from Chen Guangzu, Chen Keming, and Huang Zhenxing. Wu Xingya, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, will be transferred back to his original position as Director of the Department of Civil Affairs in Anhui, and Zhang Guanshi, Director of the Department of Finance, will be allowed to resign. However, when questioned by the parties involved, they all denied it. It is likely that the central government will have to make a decision before it can be revealed. It is heard that the entire Provincial Government Committee has jointly telegraphed the central government on the 20th, submitting their resignations, and those who concurrently hold positions as department or bureau directors have also telegraphed Beijing to resign individually.

<p>Strike Wave at British-Owned Tobacco Company in Hankou</p>
<p>Municipal Government Negotiations Ineffective</p>
<p>Workers to Stage General Strike</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Workers in the printing department of the British-owned British American Tobacco Company in Hankou were not paid wages and had their rice subsidies deducted by the factory for attending the National Assembly elections and taking leave for the May 5th Memorial Day holiday. The workers requested the factory authorities to pay wages according to the methods of other factories for more than twenty days, but the factory did not allow it. The Tobacco Guild presented the matter to the party, government, and military authorities, requesting them to mediate, but it was unsuccessful. Unexpectedly, the factory authorities suddenly closed the main switch of the electric motor, refusing workers to enter the factory, and announced a shutdown at 5:00 PM on the 19th. The announcement stated, "British American Tobacco Company Printing Department Announcement: The head office has refused to pay wages for April 15th and May 5th. The factory will be shut down from today. This announcement is for your information." The workers considered this to be oppression and, while strictly maintaining order, requested the government and party departments to provide relief. After receiving the report, the municipal government sent Secretary Zhao Longwen and Section Chief Jiang Dingyi of the Bureau of Social Affairs to the British Consulate on the 21st to negotiate, but because the British Consul was cunning, no result was achieved. In the end, Zhao et al. proposed to the British Consul that the company should be responsible for the losses suffered by the workers during the shutdown, and then returned to the municipal government to report to Mayor Liu Wendao. Liu then invited the Five-Province Diplomatic Inspector Zhou Zechun to discuss solutions for further negotiations with the British Consul. As for the workers, they are strictly observing discipline, and workers from other departments will also automatically strike to provide assistance. If the British side does not make concessions, the disturbance may be difficult to contain. (May 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e98">A True Record of the Important Border Affairs of Yunnan and Burma <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Lower Section of the Kokang Tusi Being Occupied by the British</p>
<p>After Burma was conquered by the British, it is unknown how many tens of millions of miles of Yunnan's border areas were lost as a result. Of these tens of millions of miles, from Simao, Kaijiang, and Xiaohe in the upper section to Gunlu, Jiangnan, and Banjiangkou in the lower section, it can be divided into three sections. The people of the country are fully aware of the upper section from Langsu to Xidong. In the middle section from Shenhu Pass, Wanren Pass, Jushi Pass, Tongbi Pass, Tiebi Pass, Huju Pass, Tianma Pass, to Nankan Hanlong Pass, the Tengyue Road and the British Consul meet once a year to resolve all disputes among the people. Although foreigners sometimes move the border markers, there is no major harm. However, the lower section from Lujiang Mengbang Zhugeliying to Nanbanjiangkou is extremely important. A certain gentleman who has traveled to the area to investigate has written a diary, and we have selected the main points for the reference of our fellow countrymen.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Area and Population <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The undetermined border section between Yunnan and Burma is collectively known as the "Five Five District," which includes the territories under the jurisdiction of thirteen Tusi. The thirteen Tusi are Laxmen, Mumeng, Gengma, Dedang, Xiaomengtong, Mengpeng, Mengli, Mengding, Menglang, Kokang, Gongmeng, Gangmeng, and the raw, uncivilized lands. The territories under the jurisdiction of each Tusi vary in size. The larger ones are Gengma and the raw, uncivilized lands, each with a territory of about a thousand li in length and width. The smaller ones are Mumeng, Dedang, Mengli, Menglang, Gongmeng, and Gangmeng, each with a territory of about four hundred li in length and width. In total, the territories under the jurisdiction of the thirteen Tusi are about ten thousand li in length and width. In other words, the undetermined border section between Yunnan and Burma is about ten thousand li in length and width. Since this section is located in a remote area, the population is naturally sparse. Large Tusi like Gengma can have more than ten thousand households, while small Tusi like Mumeng can have more than a thousand households. On average, each Tusi has more than two thousand households, totaling more than twenty-six thousand households, or more than one hundred and four thousand people.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Religion and Race <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The local people are very superstitious and like to worship many gods. The Han people mostly believe in Buddhism and Confucianism. The people under the jurisdiction of the Gengma Tusi are even more devout in their beliefs. Children are sent to temples to study Buddhism at the age of six or seven. As for the races, the Han people account for three-tenths of the total population, the Hui people account for two-tenths, and the remaining five-tenths are local indigenous people. Among the indigenous people, there are Baiyi, , Langsu, and tribes. Among them, the Baiyi tribe is mild-mannered and thoughtful, and is gradually merging with the Han people. The , Langsu, and are semi-uncivilized. The Hui people mostly live in the territories under the jurisdiction of the Gangmeng and Gongmeng Tusi. It is said that during the Hong Yang Rebellion, when the Hui people Du Wenxiu's rebellion in Yunnan failed, many Hui people moved from western Yunnan to this area to escape.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Education and Customs <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Very few of the indigenous people are literate, and they still live a primitive life of recording events by tying knots or carving wood. Only about one or two tenths of the Han and Hui people have received education. The schools are mostly simple, old-style private schools. As for customs, the Han people are influenced by Confucianism, and the Hui people strictly abide by the rules of Muhammad. Therefore, all weddings and funerals are no different from those of the Han and Hui people in the interior, but the forms are slightly simpler. As for the Baiyi, Langsu, and tribes, it is the opposite. Marriage is in the free form of the primitive era. Young men and women often work and sing in the mountains and fields. A kind of popular and loving song is sung, with men singing and women harmonizing, and women singing and men harmonizing. This kind of singing is the medium for the combination of men and women. When they get married, relatives and others gather to celebrate and dance for the newlyweds. However, the Langsu and other tribes have a semi-communal wife system. Funerals include burial, cremation, and wind burial.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Climate and Products <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The climate varies greatly among the Tusi. The climate in the Menglang and Mengding areas is hot and prone to malaria. Those who contract malaria die within a few hours. The climate in the Gengma and Kokang Tusi is mild, the rains are favorable, and the mountains are clear and the waters are beautiful. Therefore, the population is dense. The products are abundant in all thirteen Tusi. There is plenty of food grain and wheat. There are fierce animals such as bears, deer, tigers, and leopards. There are many silver mines, especially in the Kokang Tusi. The forests are lush, and tea, cotton, and purple stalks are famous. The variety of fruits is also numerous.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Transportation and Commercial Ports <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Transportation is difficult and travel is not easy. There is a lack of postal and telegraph services. However, the Kokang Tusi has a mild climate and abundant products, and the British forcibly occupied its territory and opened it as a commercial port. The British have established postal and telegraph schools and churches there, and have built automobile roads directly to Burma. When we arrived at the place, we could not help but feel emotional.</p>
<p>The above is a rough overview of the undetermined border section between Yunnan and Burma. Today, the British side is actively invading it, and even regards the area as their own, not allowing our country to interfere. It is hoped that the government and the people will pay special attention to this remote border area.</p>
<h3 id="e104">British Newspaper Discusses China Not Needing to Redeem the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Just Build a Narrow-Gauge Railway to the Russian Border</p>
<p>Crisis of Russian Invasion Will Be Reduced</p>
<p>Translated by World News Agency: The British newspaper said that the Chinese Eastern Railway once had the opportunity to greatly expand its route, making it the most powerful railway in Manchuria. However, this good opportunity was missed by its director Vorsterloff and the International Technical Committee. They had proposed several plans, such as the Huhu Line, which was later implemented by the Chinese side. The broad gauge used by the Chinese Eastern Railway is gradually becoming useless in Manchuria. In the future, passengers can take through trains directly to the northernmost point of Manchuria from Nanjing or Diankou without changing trains. There are already many signs of this. Recently, the Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Li Shaogeng, and several Chinese members of the board of directors went to Taonan, ostensibly to celebrate the 90th birthday of Wan Fulin's mother, but in reality, it was related to the railway construction in northern Manchuria. Currently, passengers traveling from southern or central China to the northern Manchurian border must change trains in Shenyang, take the South Manchuria Railway to Changchun, and then take the Chinese Eastern Railway train. However, after the new route to Qiqihar is completed, it is no longer necessary to go to Qiqihar via the South Manchuria Railway or the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, the line must be extended to the Soviet Russian border. The completion of this extension will not only be extremely important for freight transportation but will also have major military implications. By expanding this line to Sakhalin, the Chinese side will be able to reach the Amur River opposite the port of Blagoveshchensk. At the same time, building another line from Hailar westward will allow it to come into contact with the Soviet Russian border at Manzhouli. In this way, in the event of war, Chinese troops can travel from all parts of China directly to the Russian border without changing trains, greatly shortening the time required. At the same time, grain produced in northern Manchuria can be transported directly to the Chinese interior without changing trains. This plan is definitely under discussion now and will be implemented quickly. Once this plan is completed, the value of the Chinese Eastern Railway will be reduced by 50%, because its broad gauge is only useful for through traffic in Russia. Currently, Russia can easily drive its vehicles into Manchuria, but it is impossible to drive them on narrow-gauge. The use of broad gauge on Russian railways was based on the advice of German engineers, who had a deeper meaning. If there were a war, the German side could simply change the Russian gauge to narrow, and German vehicles could enter Russia. Because German vehicles are narrow-gauge and limited by the sleepers, the Russians cannot widen them and drive Russian vehicles into German territory. The same is true for the railway situation between China and Russia in northern Manchuria. The Chinese side only needs to lay a narrow-gauge railway to the border, and the risk of Russian invasion will be reduced. In addition to the western railway construction plan, the Chinese side also plans to build a road from Jilin along the Russian-Mongolian border to the mouth of the Songhua River. The Qiqihar line crosses the Chinese Eastern Railway on the west side, while the Jilin line crosses the Chinese Eastern Railway on the east side. The completion of this line will also greatly affect the transportation of grain to the port of Vladivostok. In short, China does not seem to need to spend millions of dollars to buy the Chinese Eastern Railway. It only needs to spend less than half the purchase price to build new routes on the east and west sides of Manchuria, and the Chinese Eastern Railway will become useless for military purposes against China, and its freight transportation will be reduced by at least half.</p>
<h3 id="e105">News of Bandit Suppression After the Military Shift in Chao-Shantou <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Bandits from Puning Retreat to Old Nest in Southern Mountain</p>
<p>Bandits from Fujian Invade Shishang District of Dapu</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The 62nd Division stationed in Chaozhou-Meizhou is making extraordinary efforts to suppress bandits. Most of the bandits in various counties have been eliminated. On the 5th and 6th of this month, the division was ordered by the province to be transferred to Zengcheng in the Dongjiang River area to return to the province. As a result, the bandits took advantage of the military's emptiness and resumed their activities. In Southern Mountain at the junction of Chaoyang, Puning, and Huilai, there are seven or eight hundred Red bandits under Peng Gui, who are entrenched there, appearing in Baishaxi and Dengxinhu in Puning. On the 10th, they attacked the Liusha district and fought fiercely with Liu Linfu's police force. The newly built turret in Yuemei Township was also burned by the bandits. The Puning Zhai Yuhong camp heard the news and went to rescue them. The bandits saw that the army was coming and retreated to the old nest in Southern Mountain. The Shantou Brigade has just received an urgent telegram from Puning stating, "The bandits in Guolong Township, Liusha, are the Guangzhou training regiment that rebelled against Ye Jianying in the past, and the former Liusha rebel police regiments of Pang Zhu and Peng Gui, using machine guns as the backbone, supplemented by short-gun teams. Recently, they have taken the opportunity to cause trouble. This battalion dispatched the Fifth and Sixth Companies at Yinshi on the 11th, along with three squads of the guard to search towards Liusha via Hengshan. They arrived at Hengshan at Maoshi on the 11th, encountered the bandits for about an hour, and then attacked and captured twelve bandits. The rest scattered and fled. They are now searching towards Liusha." In addition, Yongding County, Fujian, was occupied by the Red bandits under Zhang Dingchen again last month. On the 9th, the bandits led hundreds of people to attack the Shishang district of Dapu County, looting more than ten merchants, intending to attack Yangmen again. Fortunately, the police force of Gucun Daning Changzhi gathered in Yangmen early to defend it and engaged the bandits for an hour before the bandits collapsed and retreated. The remnants of the Red bandits in Gutai planned to return to Baxiang in Fengshun. On the 5th, they attacked Guaitan from Huangfengliu and fought fiercely with the militia but failed to break through, only looting seven water buffaloes. Bandits have also appeared in Tongguzhang and other places near Meixian Fengshun, and the people in various counties are quite uneasy.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Unsuccessful Negotiation between Jiaoji Railway Bureau and Coal Merchants Regarding Freight Rates <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau Only Agreed to a Temporary Reduction for Four Months</p>
<p>Coal Merchants Insist on Abolishing the Price Increase Method</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Zibo, Zhangwei coal merchants, considering the 20% increase in freight rates by the Jiaoji Railway Bureau unbearable, unanimously resolved to suspend operations from May 21st. Previous reports have detailed this. After receiving a telegram from the Coal Industry Joint Association, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, recognizing the significant impact of a complete shutdown of the coal industry on all aspects, convened a meeting of its members. They telegraphed Boshan, requesting the Joint Association to send representatives to the bureau to negotiate a solution. Upon receiving the telegram, Boshan promptly dispatched eight representatives, who arrived in Qingdao overnight. On the morning of the 19th, at 10 a.m., along with over twenty representatives from the Qingdao coal industry, they attended a meeting at the Jiaoji Railway Bureau. The Railway Bureau expressed partial acceptance of the Joint Association's request and, due to the urgency of the matter, scheduled a follow-up meeting for 6 p.m. that afternoon. At the resumed meeting, the Railway Bureau only agreed to a 20% reduction in inland export prices during the four summer months from June to September. Regarding the cancellation of the price increase, they stated that coal merchants would need to directly petition the government, as the Railway Bureau did not have the authority to decide. The coal merchants argued that the 20% reduction in export coal prices during the four summer months was a long-standing practice and should be implemented as usual, even without the price increase. The method proposed by the Railway Bureau was too far from the original demands of the coal merchants. Furthermore, according to the resolution passed in Boshan, the actions of the coal merchants should be guided by the Joint Association. The representatives immediately telegraphed the Boshan Joint Association to report the progress of the negotiations. At 5 a.m. today, they received a reply from the association, stating that the four-month 20% reduction was a common practice and not a thorough solution. They insisted on suspending operations pending further instructions. At noon, another telegram arrived from Boshan, reiterating the demand to abolish the freight increase. The representatives then returned to the Railway Bureau for further negotiations this afternoon. The Railway Bureau responded that the increase was mandated by the ministry and could not be easily revoked. Since the two sides could not reach an agreement, the representatives left the meeting and returned to Boshan that evening to report everything to the Joint Association. Whether normal transportation will resume remains uncertain. It is also reported that the Shanghai National Coal Production and Sales Joint Association, regarding the issues of increased freight rates on the Jiaoji Railway and the recovery of mining rights, had appointed representatives Yu Shunqing and two others to go to Beijing to petition Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang. At the same time, they also petitioned the Ministry of Railways to reduce the freight rates for national coal on the Jiaoji Railway, indicating that this issue is not only related to the area along the Jiaoji Railway.

<h3 id="e107">Jiangxi Headquarters Approves Anhui Residents to Purchase Rice <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Lifting the Rice Ban in Leping, Dexing and Other Counties</p>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence: Wuyuan County, located in the remote border area of southern Anhui, is mountainous and has little arable land. The county's food supply, except for the southwestern townships which are relatively self-sufficient, cannot even provide enough rice for one month's consumption in the northeastern townships. Most of it relies on neighboring counties in Jiangxi, such as Leping, Dexing, Wannian, and Poyang. Since the rampant banditry of the previous year, the water and land transportation between Wuyuan and Jiangxi has been blocked by a small number of troublemakers. After repeated negotiations, it was able to pass. However, the grain-producing areas of Leping and Dexing were then occupied by communist bandits, and transportation was once again cut off. The supply of rice for the people became even more scarce, and the entire county faced a rice shortage for almost a year. Although fellow villagers in Shanghai organized rice relief efforts, the long distance and inconvenience of land transportation made it difficult to provide timely assistance. Fortunately, the southwestern townships had a good rice harvest last year, which averted famine. This year, with the old harvest depleted and the new harvest not yet available, the county public organization, recognizing the food shortage among the military and civilians, raised funds to purchase rice in Wuhu, Jiangxi, and Raozhou. Last month, when the rice was being transported through Xiangtan in Dexing, it was suddenly detained by Xu Jinluo, the county magistrate of Dexing, who firmly refused to release it. Gao, the magistrate of Wuyuan, and various public organizations telegraphed He, the director of the Nanchang headquarters, requesting him to order the county to release the rice and to lift the rice ban in Leping, Dexing, Poyang, and Wannian. They also telegraphed the fellow villagers in Xunyang, requesting them to send representatives to petition the local authorities for relief. The New Anhui fellow villagers in Jiujiang appointed Zhan Mingqiu and Cheng Guangzao as representatives to go to the province to meet with Director He, Chairman Lu, and Minister Wang, to explain the situation. Director He immediately approved the request, telegraphed the Dexing County Magistrate to release the previously detained Wuyuan rice, and authorized the lifting of the rice ban in Leping, Dexing, Poyang, and Wannian, ordering the counties to comply. The memorial of the Xunyang fellow villagers and the instructions of Director He are recorded below: (1) Memorial of the Xunyang Fellow Villagers: "Presenting a memorial regarding the mistaken detention of rice boats, causing starvation among the people of Wuyuan, requesting that the authorities investigate and follow past practices, allowing the limited purchase and transportation of rice to maintain the people's food supply." Wuyuan County is located in a remote border area, surrounded by mountains on three sides. The rugged and steep mountains are as difficult to traverse as the roads of Shu. Only the streams connected to Dexing and Leping in Jiangxi Province are navigable. The main products are vegetables. The county's own grain production can only supply food for three months. The rest relies on counties such as Dexing, Leping, Wannian, and Poyang to survive, requiring approximately 5,000 shi of rice per month. This has been the case for centuries. In the past, when Jiangxi banned rice exports, Wuyuan was treated the same and allowed to continue transporting rice as usual. This is the special situation of Wuyuan's insufficient grain supply, which relies on Dexing and Leping. The waterways of Dexing and Leping are the lifeline of Wuyuan, and this is the only route for transportation in and out. In recent years, banditry has been frequent, and there have been successive droughts and floods, causing hundreds of thousands of people to suffer. Now, the area is a bandit suppression zone, and the troops stationed in Wuyuan are lacking food, causing even greater panic. If the source of food is cut off, hundreds of thousands of people will either die at the hands of bandits or starve to death. The Wuyuan Chamber of Commerce, recognizing this, has raised funds to purchase rice and grains in Dexing, Leping, Wannian, Poyang and other counties, selling them at a fair price, purely to maintain the daily food supply of the military and civilians and is not involved in commercial activities. The county is located inland, and the mountain roads are rugged, making it impossible to transport the rice to other places. This is not comparable to coastal ports on the Yangtze River, which have no restrictions. The Dexing County Magistrate, without investigating the special situation of Wuyuan's food supply and misunderstanding the strict order from the government prohibiting large-scale commercial rice exports, did not first present the special situation for instructions but immediately stopped the rice, disregarding the hundreds of thousands of people in Wuyuan. Even in times of famine, international law does not allow the embargo of grain. Moreover, these are neighboring counties belonging to the same national government, and there should be no distinction between regions. In addition to appointing Zhan Mingqiu and Cheng Guangzao as representatives to petition the authorities to explain everything, we hereby submit this memorial, requesting your government to consider the imminent starvation of hundreds of thousands of people in Wuyuan, quickly order the Dexing County government to release the rice that was previously detained, and allow the limited monthly purchase of rice to relieve the people's food supply. We are waiting anxiously for your orders." (2) Response from the Headquarters: "Received and noted. Regarding the food shortage in Wuyuan, the county magistrate and various public organizations have previously telegraphed reports. The headquarters has already considered the situation to be factual and has authorized the lifting of the rice ban in Leping and Dexing, Jiangxi, and ordered the release of the previously detained rice boats to provide relief. A separate telegram has been sent for compliance. You are hereby notified." (May 13)</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Trial Process of the Xu Zhuoran Assassination Case by the Hangzhou Court <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The assassination case of Xu Zhuoran in Xiamen, involving the former principal of Jimei School, Ye Caizhen, has been transferred to the Hangzhou Court for trial by the judicial authorities. It is reported that the Hangzhou Court has summoned various witnesses and held multiple hearings. There is no evidence regarding the accusation against Ye for murder. Chen Delin, who confessed to Ye's murder in the Tong'an Corps, has confessed in both the Xiamen and Hangzhou courts that the confession was obtained through torture by the Corps. The evidence presented by Ye's side also showed that he was not at the school on the day Chen claimed he negotiated at the school and the day the suspects handed over the money. Moreover, of the three suspects confessed by Chen, Lin Min was beaten to death in September of the seventeenth year. The Hangzhou Court entrusted the Siming Court to verify the fact, and it was confirmed that Lin Min was dead and could not have committed the murder in the nineteenth year. Based on the above circumstances, the case could have been concluded earlier. However, it is said that one or two military authorities have repeatedly sent telegrams to the Hangzhou Court to argue, which has delayed the resolution of the case.</p>

<p>Since the execution of Taibao A Shu, the ringleader of the Taihu bandits, Xu A Da, the remaining bandit leader, has recently led over two hundred men to areas around the Three Hills Gate, Lake Mouth, and Yangcheng Lake in Taihu Lake, attempting to revive the gang.

<h3 id="e114">Details of the Robbery in the Suzhou Countryside <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The following are the details of the case of lake bandits continuously robbing and killing in the Shiqiao Town, Lu Mu area of the Suzhou countryside. Wang Chuantou (Wang Boatman) is about 30 li from the Lu Mu area office, with 30-50 merchants, mostly wealthy. There are brothers surnamed Shen, the elder brother Zhu Rong, who practices medicine in Shanghai, and the younger brother Zhu Ling, who practices medicine at home. They are extremely wealthy in land property, and the area is quite prominent. The area is about 4-5 li from Lu She in Changshu, separated by only one river. On the other side is Xinzhuang. Previously, on the 20th, the Yue Temple festival in Changshu was very popular, and the bandit scouts took the opportunity to gamble, observing the wealth of the residents based on the size of the gambling wins and losses, in preparation for the robbery. In the evening, after the residents of Wang Chuantou returned from the festival, several bandit ships carrying over a hundred bandits armed with weapons sailed from Yangcheng Lake to Yaojia浜 in Shiqiao Town, Huangdai area. They landed from the east and invaded the home of Xu Nancun, the village head of Gate No. 2, tying up Xu and his wife and two sons. Then, they went to the home of Xu Ruichen, kidnapping his son Rong Sheng. At the same time, another group of over fifty people went to No. 2, Lu Jia Li, nearby, kidnapping four residents: Lu Gunguan, Lu Abao, Lu Amao, and Lu Shunsheng. When the neighbor Lu Shansheng sounded the alarm on the roof, he was shot and killed by the bandits, who dragged the body away and also shot Lu Genbao. At 3 a.m. on the 21st, the bandits again raided Wang Chuantou in Lu Mu. At that time, Shen Zhuling's mother had gone to relatives in Changshu city, and Shen's wife had taken her two sons to Xinzhuang. Only Shen himself was at home taking care of the house because he needed to see patients. A group of about twenty bandits, all armed with pistols, iron rulers, and flashlights, directly surrounded Shen's house. Shen was awakened from his sleep, and he quickly climbed onto the roof and knocked on an oil drum to sound the alarm. The bandits used a large stone to break down the gate, tied up Shen, and forced him to reveal where the money was hidden. As a result, all the valuables in the house were robbed. All those with any wealth in the village were also robbed. Before leaving, they took Shen to a bandit ship, entered Yangcheng Lake, and left. At the same time, Liu Jinrong, a merchant from Shanghai, had returned home to see the festival. Because he was wearing nice clothes, he was also kidnapped.</p>

If they are not severely punished, it would not be enough to deter the bandits. Therefore, on the 22nd, they telegraphed the Capital Garrison Headquarters, requesting them to order the Railway Guard Corps to severely punish the bandits to deter them.</p>

The bandits searched for a long time, but finding nothing of value, went one by one to the homes of Tao Shunfa and others, searching each house. After four hours, they still found nothing, so they shouted slogans such as "Big bad luck" and set off firecrackers, escaping in a southeastern direction. Afterwards, Yuan Zishun, the leader of the first squad of the sixth team of the second district of the water police stationed there, led armed police officers to investigate and pursue, but the bandits had already fled far away. Tao Buyun and his wife, who were injured, were unable to pay for medical treatment. Yuan gave them five yuan for medical expenses and sent them to the city hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Xiaoshan County Government received a provincial telegram stating that the cocoon tax should be changed to a business tax. A public notice was issued to the cocoon merchants in various towns and villages, stating that according to the provincial telegram, the cocoon tax, which Zhejiang Province has always collected, should no longer be collected this year in accordance with the central government's order to abolish transit taxes. The business tax to be collected will be based on the tax rate set by the ministry, which is only 2/1000, a very light burden. As for the local funds contributed by cocoon merchants in various cities and counties, since they are not in the nature of transit taxes and are related to local donations, they should still be donated by the cocoon merchants as usual to maintain them.</p>

<p>Zhou Weishun, a fisherman living outside the South Gate of Xiaoshan, on Dongdai, quarreled with his wife, Guo, because his son did not engage in proper work. His wife, Guo, was naturally hot-tempered. On the 20th of this month, the couple quarreled again. At night, his wife clapped her hands on the table and cursed loudly. Weishun, feeling that his reputation was at stake, did not dare to go home. That night, it happened to be raining, so he threw himself into the river and drowned. The next morning, his body floated to the surface. His wife met him at the riverbank and deeply regretted her actions. On the night of the 23rd, she also hanged herself. Neighbors discovered this and tried to rescue her, but it was too late.</p>

<h3 id="e132">The Opium Scourge in Various Counties of Northern Anhui <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The opium scourge in northern Anhui has been poisoning the region for many years. The authorities have long adopted a policy of disguising prohibition as taxation, which has only served to exacerbate the problem. Wei Lihuang, the commander of the Northern Anhui Garrison, in order to eradicate the opium scourge, strictly ordered the counties to prohibit it in September and promulgated four articles of punitive regulations, with violators subject to military law. However, in counties such as Su, Si, Meng, Wo, Hao, Fu, Ying, and Tai, greedy and foolish people still secretly planted opium. In recent months, the poisonous flowers have flourished, filling the fields. Some officials and gentry in several counties have even implemented registration and collected seedling taxes, with some counties charging opium seedling taxes of more than ten to seventy yuan per mu. A few days ago, a certain county magistrate, so-and-so, summoned the district chiefs and ordered them to acknowledge an opium tax of 300,000 yuan, or face imprisonment. Such stories are shocking, but they are common in northern Anhui and are not surprising. Wei Lihuang has recently received repeated reports of counties registering and collecting seedling taxes without authorization. A few days ago, he sent telegrams to the county magistrates of Fuyang, Hao County, Woyang, Taihe, Yingshang, Su County, and Si County, ordering them to thoroughly investigate and report within five days to facilitate verification and handling. He also sent telegrams to the county party departments in the aforementioned counties, instructing them to report any information they may have obtained as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I was shocked to read the news item entitled "Red Bandit Zhang Pengchao and Others Apprehended" in the local correspondence column of your newspaper on May 15th. The content of the report is completely inconsistent with the facts. Zhang Pengchao and others have served the local community for many years. They were previously framed and falsely accused by local petty criminals and recently came to the provincial capital to defend themselves and await trial. Furthermore, the County Chamber of Commerce, Farmers' Association, Financial Management Office, District Office, standing brigades, and various organizations of the county have dispatched representatives Qin Tichen and Yang Juchen to the provincial capital to present the circumstances of Zhang Pengchao and others being wrongly accused to the Anhui Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, and the Military Law Review Board. I believe that the truth of this case will be easily resolved. I am deeply concerned that the rumors are untrue and will confuse public opinion. I am writing to request that your newspaper correct the record. Zhang Pengchao, Wu Jingxiu, Hua Kaihao, and others from Yuyi County, May 21st.</p>

<p>China Sends Personnel to Prepare to Participate</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently approved a communication from the British Minister to China, Lampson, stating that the Fifth Pacific Science Congress, at the request of the Canadian government, is scheduled to be held in Victoria and Vancouver in June 1932. The Congress is composed of representatives from scientific societies affiliated with the Pacific Science Association, which was established in 1920. Its purpose is to promote cooperation on scientific issues in the Pacific region, particularly those related to the prosperity and well-being of the people of the Pacific. The National Research Council of Canada, which is affiliated with the Science Association, is preparing all aspects of the Congress. The Minister hereby represents the Research Council in inviting the Chinese government to send representatives to participate. Furthermore, since the China Science Society in Nanjing has previously represented China at the Honolulu Science Association, the invitation should be conveyed to the staff of the Society. The Congress is prepared to host ten official representatives from the Chinese government and the China Science Society. Additional unofficial representatives and representatives from other organizations are welcome to participate, but they must bear their own expenses. After approving the communication, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the Ministry of Education to consider and respond. The Ministry of Education, noting that the previous Pacific Science Congress was attended by representatives from the Academia Sinica, considered this matter to be the same and sent a letter to the Academia Sinica requesting it to prepare to select representatives to attend. It is reported that the Academia Sinica had already made plans for the Congress and had appointed members of the various committees of the Preparatory Committee to prepare and plan immediately in order to ensure perfection. The list of members of the Preparatory Committee for the Fifth Pacific Science Congress is recorded below: Chen Zongyi (Agriculture), Song Chunfang (Oceanography), Zhang Xinyi (Agriculture), Weng Wenhao (Standing Committee Member and Geology), Bingzhi (Standing Committee Member and Zoology), Li Siguang (Physics), Qian Chongshu (Botany), Li Ji (Anthropology), Hu Xian (Botany), Jiang Bingran (Meteorology and Oceanography), Zhu Kezhen (Standing Committee Member and Meteorology), Ministry of Education.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Anhui Provincial Department of Education regarding a request from the Chuxian County Educational Association for an explanation of the powers of the executive secretary, instructed the Department as follows: The report has been noted. The powers of the executive secretary of the County Educational Association should be comparable to those of the executive director of the Provincial Educational Association under Article 22 of the Educational Association Law, and his powers are to perform routine affairs. You are hereby informed to acknowledge this and to instruct accordingly.</p>

<p>Party-Educational Institutions Organize Qualification Review Committee for Party Teachers</p>
<p>Party ideology teachers and deans of students at all levels of schools in this city have been appointed only after being certified by the Party Ideology Teacher Certification Committee jointly established by the Training Department of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Bureau of Education. Since its implementation, the committee has certified four sessions, totaling about two hundred people, which has yielded significant results. However, the Central Government previously found that the certification system had shortcomings, so it formulated an overall plan, which was approved by the Central Standing Committee. It issued the Provisional Regulations for Reviewing the Qualifications of Party Ideology Teachers and the Organizational Regulations for the Qualification Review Committee for Party Ideology Teachers, ordering party committees at all levels to organize committees with the local educational administrative agencies to handle the review matters in their respective areas in accordance with the law. All previous certification regulations were abolished. After receiving the order, the Municipal Executive Committee and the Training Department began preparations. The Training Department drafted the Provisional Regulations for Reviewing the Qualifications of Party Ideology Teachers in Shanghai Municipality, the Organizational Regulations for the Qualification Review Committee for Party Ideology Teachers in Shanghai Municipality, and the list of committee members. These were approved by the 100th session of the Executive Committee and then submitted to the Central Training Department for approval. Letters of appointment were issued to formally appoint the committee members. The list of committee members is as follows: Jiang Huaishu (alternate supervisory member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee), Zhu Jiarang (chief executive of the Party Ideology Education Section of the Municipal Training Department), Wu Xianren (chief executive of the Party Member Training Section of the Municipal Training Department), Wang Manyun (chief executive of the General Affairs Section of the Municipal Training Department), Yuan Yeyu (editor of the Republic Daily), Yang Peiwen (staff member of the Municipal Bureau of Education), Chen Duanzhi (staff member of the Municipal Bureau of Education). After the Qualification Review Committee for Party Ideology Teachers in this city was organized in accordance with the law, all work was handled by the Party Ideology Education Section of the Municipal Training Department. However, since the committee's organization was originally based on a committee system, it was necessary to elect standing committee members to oversee the work and to ensure that the important regulations and methods were decided by the committee in accordance with the law. Therefore, the first meeting was held at the Municipal Party Committee at 1:00 PM yesterday. The committee members present were Yang Peiwen, Chen Duanzhi, Wu Xianren, Wang Manyun, Zhu Jiarang, and Jiang Huaishu. Zhu Jiarang was elected as the chairman. The important resolutions are recorded below: 1. Zhu Jiarang was elected as the standing committee member. 2. The Shanghai Municipality Regulations for Reviewing the Qualifications of Party Ideology Teachers were approved. 3. The Detailed Rules for the Operation of the Qualification Review Committee for Party Ideology Teachers in Shanghai Municipality were approved. 4. The Meeting Rules for the Qualification Review Committee for Party Ideology Teachers in Shanghai Municipality were approved. 5. The Shanghai Municipality Party Ideology Teacher Qualification Review Form (including the application form and curriculum vitae) was approved. The starting and ending dates for the first review of Party ideology teachers were determined to be from June 10th to September 10th, a period of three months. 7. A request will be submitted to the Municipal Executive Committee for the issuance of an official seal. It is reported that all Party ideology teachers or deans of students in all schools in the city, regardless of whether they have been previously certified, must apply to the committee for review or registration in accordance with the law and obtain a certificate.</p>

<p>(Seoul, Korea, 22nd Dispatch) The Liangjiang Basketball Team defeated the Japanese Girls' High School again, 55-13. Yesterday (the 21st), they departed for Shenyang and will return to Shanghai.</p>

<p>(Seoul Correspondence) After arriving in Seoul, Korea, on the 14th, the Liangjiang Girls' School basketball team rested for one day due to the fatigue of traveling. On the afternoon of the 16th, they held their first match against the Tongde Girls' High School basketball team. The location was the Seoul Sports Ground. Chinese and Japanese national flags were hung at the entrance, fluttering in the wind. The flags of the Korean News Agency, which hosted the event, were hung around the perimeter of the field. The event was heavily decorated as a promotional opportunity for the agency. There were more than 2,000 spectators, with Chinese expatriates and students on the right, Japanese expatriates on the left, and Korean students and civilians on both sides, all cheering enthusiastically. The crowd regarded this as an unprecedented grand event in the Korean Peninsula's sports scene. The team entered the field at 4:30 PM. The players of both teams stood side by side, and Kwon, the president of the Korean News Agency, delivered the opening speech, explaining the significance of initiating an international women's sports competition and expressing the hope that they would jointly promote the spirit of sportsmanship. Vice President Mushe of the Korean Sports Association and Ji Damin, the Acting Consul General of our country, delivered speeches successively, expressing their sincerity. The match began at 5:10 PM. Watanabe and Kasaya served as referees. The match ended at 6:00 PM. Liangjiang won a major victory over Tongde with a score of 27-16. The scores for each quarter are as follows: First Quarter 10-5, Second Quarter 13-1, Third Quarter 3-1, Fourth Quarter 1-9.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation of both sides in the war, the Liangjiang team worked hard in the first half of the match, unanimously using contact skills. The ball was contested and stolen, causing the other party to be timid. The Tongde team's movements were slow, their passing was lacking, and they always felt stretched, making it difficult to develop. In the last five minutes of the second half, the Korean audience cheered loudly and enthusiastically supported the Tongde players, who took a deep breath and fought desperately. Taking advantage of the Liangjiang team's fatigue, they even scored a few goals. However, the result was still more than ten points apart. Tongde was not an enemy of Liangjiang. In this battle, Liangjiang's Shao Jinying greatly showed her skills, scoring fourteen points alone. Indeed, so-called three-point division has its ground. Li Yiyun is really heroic!</p>

<p>In the past, Suzhou's sports achievements had no record at all. "Because they are Suzhou Misses" has also become synonymous with weakness. After Xu Minhui, the coach of Soochow University, and Ms. Lin Yunsheng, the coach of Suzhou Women's Middle School, initiated the organization of the Women's Sports Association in 1929, they initially engaged in the promotion of ball games. In 1930, they held an athletics competition once. Thanks to the efforts of the sports community, both provincial sports meets came back with banners. Therefore, the name of Suzhou Miss was changed to become the focus of the sports community of the whole province. Now, this year's women's track and field competition will be held at the Zhu Jiazhuang Cheng Lie Special Stadium at 9:00 AM today. Preparations have already been completed. Tickets have been sold in advance and have been very popular. On the day of the event, the results will be broadcasted by the Suzhou Da Su Tong News Agency through the Guo Hua Electric Radio Station. It is certain that Cheng Lie, Zhuang Mingzhen, Zhang Maolan and Zhu Guoying of Suzhou Women's Middle School will have excellent results. However, it is a pity that Miss Zhang of the Women's Middle School was injured in the leg during the last provincial sports meet and has not yet recovered. Those with good skills do not know whether they can be addicted to sports enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Although there were only three finals yesterday, judging from the overall situation, Jinling will undoubtedly win the track and field championship. They have already scored ten points. In today's finals, the discus is also Jinling's. Others such as Ling Yuanyang in the triple jump, Yu Ziyu in the pole vault, and Qian Shuqiong in the high jump all have a chance to be selected. Soochow is in the majority for second place.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Track Championship <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Although Jinling has already taken the lead with six points in track, Hujiang has many talented sprinters, and Lin Guangxing has great prospects in the 100 meters and 200 meters. Therefore, if Hujiang makes doubled efforts, it may be able to seize the championship. Soochow and University of Shanghai have less hope.</p>
<p>Meet Records</p>
<p>1,500 Meters and 200 Meters 丨 New Meet Records</p>
<p>Low Hurdles 100 Meters 丨 Tied Meet Record</p>
<p>Two new meet records were set yesterday: (1) Meng Guangxin of Jinling, 1,500 meters final with a time of 4 minutes 48.5 seconds, breaking Yang Pu's 4 minutes 53 seconds. (2) Lin Guangxing of Hujiang, 200 meters preliminary with a time of 24 seconds, breaking Zhou Xingjue's 24.4 seconds. Two meet records were tied: (1) 100 meters preliminary, first in both groups, Lin Guangxing of Hujiang and Chen Jiayou of Soochow, both with a time of 11.6 seconds. (2) Low hurdles preliminary, first in the first group, Ling Yuanyang of Jinling, with a time of 27.8 seconds, tied the highest meet record.</p>
<p>Finals Report</p>
<p>There were a total of three finals yesterday. A brief description of the events is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e157">16-Pound Shot Put <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Leng Peigen of Jinling won first place in the third attempt of the final with 9.92 meters. The results were average. In the competition of nine people, the highest score in the preliminary round was Leng Peigen's 9.62 meters. In the final, Chen Guoxiang of Soochow progressed to 9.64 meters to get second place. Hu Minteng of Hujiang's 9.425 meters ranked third as a preliminary round result. Liu Xingqian of Hujiang ranked fourth with a score of 9.35 meters. The ground was slippery after the rain, so the results were not particularly outstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Long Jump <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>During the long jump final, there were surprises and joys. Ling Yuanchang of Jinling, the defending champion, did not exceed six meters in five jumps, while Wang Pusheng of University of Shanghai took the lead with 5.97 meters. Unexpectedly, in the last attempt of Ling Yuanyang alone, he jumped out six meters and suddenly took first place. The result was 6.19 meters. The results were average. The second place and below were all less than six meters. It may be because the run-up was loose. There were few other changes during the game.</p>
<h3 id="e159">1500 Meters <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Nine people started. At 400 meters, Xia Xianzhuan of Shanghai led, with Meng Guangxin of Jinling closely following. Then Zhan Zongyi and Yu Xin accelerated. Meng Guangxin of Jinling sped up, and at 800 meters, he was already ahead of Xia Xianzhuan. At this time, Huang Dexing of Soochow was also gradually catching up. At 1200 meters, Meng Guangxin increased his speed, Xia Xianzhuan fell behind by 30 meters, and Huang Dexing of Soochow caught up to fourth place. In the final 300 meters, Meng Guangxin sprinted and took first place with a time of four minutes and forty-eight and five-tenths seconds. Xia Xianzhuan was still 50 meters behind.

<h3 id="e167">A Record of the Michigan Spring Banquet Amidst the Misty Wind and Rain <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Pu Cang</p>
<p>What is the magnificent new building on Weihaiwei Road? It is the Central Society (中社) organized by the core members from the sea. On the evening of days gone by, the University of Michigan Alumni Association held a gathering here. Although the weather was not good, with wind and rain swirling about, the event was still well-attended by many talented people, both young and old. How can one not record this? That night, anyone driving past the entrance of the Central Society could see a seal-script plaque with English annotations fluttering in the wind and rain. The inscription read "University of Michigan Spring Gathering," and the annotation was "A Day of Wolverines in China." A "wolverine" is the name of a voracious animal and a special product of the state of Michigan in North America, hence people from that state often use it as another name for themselves. It is commonly used in sporting events or ball games. Those on the sea have not seen this before. The architecture of the Central Society is exquisite, and the furnishings are particularly artistic. Many works by Wang Yachen, who draws on the past while lingering in France, were displayed. In terms of traditional Chinese paintings, there were many old works from the Former Cold Friend Painting Association, such as Yi Yuanjing's bamboo and rocks, Chen Shuren's flowers and birds, He Xiangning's plum blossoms, Li Qiujun and Li Zuhán's green and blue landscapes, and Zheng Wuchang and Qian Shouting's ink paintings, all outstanding figures of their time. As the silver lamps were lit, Chen Tingrui immediately brought his young son along. Before long, male and female classmates had arrived in droves. There were quite a few people who "brought in husband and wife." Foreign classmates attending the meeting included American Consul General E. S. Cunningham, American Court Prosecutor in China Dr. Sellet, Japanese Commercial Counselor to China Kan Seimatsu, and St. John's University Professor P. B. Sullivan. As the clock struck seven, Chairman Chen Tingrui announced the start of the dinner. The seating was arranged in a U-shape, and the table was decorated with yellow and blue paper ribbons, forming an M-shape. It was as natural as a school badge of the U of M. Wu Jingxiong arrived last and repeatedly praised this application of fine arts in practice. After the chairman's opening remarks, Cunningham delivered a speech first. As he stood up, everyone watched and cheered, congratulating him on his continued vigor despite his age and his recent election. The order of events included a "age test" as a form of entertainment. Prizes were given to the oldest and youngest attendees. The oldest received a four-foot vertical scroll painting of golden fruit by Yu Xueyang. The youngest received candy, also a gift from Yu Xueyang. Cunningham graduated from Michigan many years ago, more than twenty years ago. Although he did not appear decrepit, his gold-flecked frosted temples and completely bald head already told people of his advanced age and status among his peers. His speech was mainly about historical anecdotes, which could be used as a reference for studying the history of the development of the United States. Michigan is located between the eastern and western United States and is extremely rich in natural resources. At that time, it was very difficult to travel from the east to the west, similar to traveling from China to the United States now. The University of Michigan has contributed greatly to the prosperity of the western United States today. He also said that the famous American warship S.S. Houston from the European War is now docked in Shanghai and plans to send invitations to alumni to visit. Next, Sellet delivered a speech that was extremely humorous. He said that he saw former apprentices sitting at the table, so although he could not compare to Cunningham as a first-generation graduate, he was still a second-generation graduate. The crowd laughed for a long time. Some people called out, "A grand meeting of three generations, a grand meeting!" He also mentioned that University of Michigan alumni have made great political contributions in recent years, such as the fact that there were as many as four cabinet members during President Coolidge's era. Following him, Sullivan spoke. He was good at sports, especially basketball, so he was able to give a systematic report on the championship situation of various sports at Michigan during the year, such as track and field, football, basketball, baseball, indoor sports, ice sports, and swimming, in an organized and orderly manner. However, there were many fraternity members who had recently been fined for violating the alcohol prohibition, which was also an interesting anecdote. Finally, Wu Jingxiong spoke, using extremely amusing jokes to adjust the psychology of the crowd and elicit a roar of laughter. It can be said that he was skilled in rhetoric. Immediately after, the staff was briefly elected. The event was also supported by Tianchu, Wuzhou, Weiyi, and Central factories, which provided monosodium glutamate, soap, Liangdan, and chili soy sauce as gifts. Attendees were able to leave with full loads.</p>
<h3 id="e168">A Short Note on Seeing Off the Spring <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>On my day off, I had half a day of leisure and visited Mengrong. It was exactly half past eight, and Mengrong had already been working for some time. His female student, Madam Ma, wife of Zhu Qizhan, asked him to revise her draft. She was also early. The paintings were three pieces, including azaleas, etc. The brushwork closely resembled Mengrong's and did not seem like the work of a woman. I heard that she had only been studying painting for half a year, but her achievements were already remarkable. I invited Mengrong for a stroll in Zhaofeng Park. On this day, Mr. Zhu invited Mengrong for a stroll in Zhaofeng Park. Madam Ma had finished revising the draft and went ahead, saying that she would come to pick us up in a car. Mengrong painted a willow and swallow for me. The old willow was dancing, and the swallows were flying. The description of the scenery was wonderful, right down to the tip of the brush. Suddenly, I saw a picture of strange fish hanging on the wall. It depicted several peculiar fish, with lively expressions, reminiscent of Zhuangzi by the Hao River. Zhao Huishu had similar works in the past, and Mengrong was no less skilled. Mengrong has a book called "Ink Fun," which specifically discusses the use of ink as the use of color. The wonderful fun is endless and can be a model. "Spectrum of Grass Insects, Fish, and Crabs": First, depict the shape; second, depict the spirit; third, depict the intention. Use straight lines as the foundation and beauty as the ultimate goal. The publication of these two books will benefit future students. How shallow could they be?</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu arrived in his car, and we went together. Ms. Jin Qijing was also in the car, and she and Mengrong were talking about the current Sino-Japanese Painting Exhibition. Their enthusiasm was extremely high. The car traveled very quickly, and we arrived in an instant. Upon entering, the fragrant aroma filled my nostrils, almost intoxicating me. I jokingly said to Mengrong, "We are in the hustle and bustle of everyday life, burying our heads in work, and we don't know when it is spring or when it is summer. We only know that there is a difference between cold and warm, but there is no great difference. Now, looking at this beautiful park, with its lush trees and beautiful flowers and plants, I know that on the bustling Shenjiang (申江) River, there is still such a blessed place." Mengrong smiled. Most of the visitors were Westerners, in groups of three or two, with children in tow. Some were taking pictures, and some were boating (small toy sailboats, placed in the pond and moving slowly, were extremely interesting). In the dense green trees, I saw a Western woman holding a fairy tale book, surrounded by four or five children, quietly listening to her narration. The focus of Western family education is evident here. Compared to Chinese women who bring their children solely for the purpose of enjoying the park, the difference is vast. There were also four Western children acting like rascals and resisting, but they respected each other, were orderly and polite. All these things are worthy of emulation. When we got to the zoo, Mengrong quickly sketched a hawk, which was glaring and showing its ferocity. His sketch of the parrot was also quite lifelike. This bird is known for its ability to speak and was calling out "Hello, hello." He also sketched several other exotic birds. When he sketched a squirrel, everyone was surprised by its uniqueness. The squirrel's body had colors of yellow, blue, white, and black. The wonder of creation is truly unfathomable. After leaving the zoo, we walked slowly along the path, admiring the exotic grasses and rare flowers in the garden. The flower season had passed, and the special hybrid roses were as tall as people, with pale yellow petals falling. There were a few buds waiting to bloom. The willow leaves were soft and no longer had a delicate appearance. The water lilies in the pond were displaying their pure white beauty. The coming of spring, I did not see it; the passing of spring, I was able to see it. I recited Banqiao Daoren's "Bodhisattva Man" poem, "I can't keep the spring, so it goes. Where does the spring go after all? Come earlier next year. Await the trimming of the fireworks. The snow melts and spring comes again. Spring comes, and people grow old. Don't complain about the east wind. The east wind is complaining about me." I couldn't help but feel moved. Therefore, I wrote this short note on seeing off the spring and asked Mengrong and Qizhan what they thought of it.</p>

<p>— Ming Jing</p>
<p>Recently, the gramophone record business has been booming. Various companies are hiring theatrical specialists to handle liaison work, sound recording, and play arrangement. The best-selling discs in each company are those recorded by Mei (Lanfang) and Yu (Shuyan). However, most of the previous recordings were individual solos, which became boring after a while. Last year, Victory Company specially hired Mr. Xu Muyun to take charge of this area in order to seek progress. Mr. Xu has had many dealings with famous actors from both the North and South. It happened that Lanfang and Fuying were both performing in Shanghai at that time, so after some liaison, an agreement was reached. It was decided to record several pieces in total: "Selling Horses," "Yang Guifei," "Starting the Journey," "Teaching the Son," "Meeting of Heroes," and "Zhuliang Village." The above pieces have now been produced and are on sale. Yesterday, I bought a set (seven discs). "Selling Horses" is a duet between Mei and Miaoxiang, a descriptive passage. "Starting the Journey" is a dialogue between Mei and Xiao (Changhua), a passage about bribing the escort. "Yang Guifei" is a dialogue between Mei and Jiang, a passage about Gao Lishi reporting the alarm. "Teaching the Son" has one side with the "Nanbangzi" tune and the other side with the "Fan Xipi" tune. Although they are all Mei Lanfang's solo performances, the new tunes composed are extremely beautiful. The use of "Fan Xipi" for female roles also began with this disc by Lanfang. The duet between Xiao and Jiang in "Meeting of Heroes" and the dialogue between the Fuying father and son in "Zhuliang Village" are both extremely brilliant. Each disc is also accompanied by new and exquisite play notes to increase interest, it is said.</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>On the morning of the fifth, the train arrived in Busan. Busan is located at the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula, separated by the Tsushima Strait from Shimonoseki, Japan. The journey by ship takes seven or eight hours, making it very convenient for transporting goods and passengers.</p>
<p>The Busan Consulate General is backed by mountains and faces the sea. The flowers and trees are serene and lovely. It is a pity that the building is in disrepair, which is not only dangerous for the residents but also concerns the dignity of the nation. Consul Chen Junzheng and others led us to the top of Yongdusan Mountain, where the entire city was in view.</p>
<p>Busan is the main hub for the export of various goods by sea and land to the south. It ranks first among all commercial ports in Korea. The Gyeongsangnam-do Provincial Office is located here. The population is over 116,000, and there are over 42,000 Japanese, accounting for more than one-third. As mentioned earlier, Japan is moving its citizens to South Korea, and this is evidence of that.</p>
<p>In the evening, we boarded the train from Shimonoseki to Tokyo. The train journey took twenty hours. Along the way, there was no open space to be seen. Needless to say, the villages we passed were surrounded by flowers and trees, with a sense of beauty in their cleanliness. The most numerous type of advertisements along the way pierced my eyes: chemical factories. I saw one chemical factory after another, continuously.</p>
<p>The third-class car was packed with hundreds of men, women, and children, sitting upright all night. There were no loud conversations or boisterous laughter, and there was no coughing. The order was extremely good. The train attendants swept and cleaned every one or two hours. Among the police, military police, soldiers, stationmasters, conductors, ticket sellers, ticket inspectors, train attendants, and even various vendors and children, there was not a single one who was not respectful and dutiful. Their respect and politeness towards the passengers, and the corresponding courtesy of the passengers towards them, can be called unparalleled. It was as if we had entered a well-mannered household, with strict teachers and fathers above, and the children absolutely did not dare to be presumptuous. This was my fifth trip to Japan, and I had become accustomed to it. My companions, who were visiting for the first time, were especially amazed and full of praise.</p>
<p>The cherry blossoms along the way were in full bloom, but the snow on the mountaintops had not yet melted, forming a poem.</p>
<p>In the Sanyo Road</p>
<p>In the morning, I caressed the pine trees on the top of Yongdusan Mountain. In the evening, the train departed from Shimonoseki under a covered sky. I sat tightly with my jacket on, passing the long evening. The moon was bright, flying tracelessly for a thousand miles. The border between heaven and man can be observed. The sea country is in deep spring, but it is still cold. Cherry blossoms are below the mountain, and snow is above it. The red makeup and white hair are pleasing to the eye.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Hawthorne's Transposition Case (22) <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>I shifted my gaze and stared. It was also a Chinese person, wearing a black robe, very tall. This person accidentally turned his face, and I recognized him as that hateful and pitiful Qiu Kui. I was about to ask the question, "How is he here too?" Hawthorne suddenly said softly, "Don't ask yet. Now, try to use your gaze again and look at the outer corner on the left side of this wide room. Are there any people you recognize there?" I followed his instructions and looked far away. I saw that in the corner facing outwards on the left, there were also two local diners. One was a man and one was a woman. The woman was wearing a light yellow qipao, with black butterflies embroidered on the hem. Her hair was permed and unusually fluffy. This kind of dress was the most popular in Shanghai at that time. Her face was also very beautiful. She was looking down and talking and laughing with the man opposite her. The man was wearing a chestnut-colored suit, and his shiny hair was combed back very neatly. He had a tilted face, pressing close to the woman, with a flattering smile on his face. I looked again carefully. His nose was hooked, and his eyes were angular, which could not help but shock me. I said to Hawthorne in a low voice, "Is that Che Shijie?" Hawthorne winked at me and replied, "Why do you need to call him by name?" I was suddenly filled with anger and unconsciously moved my chair a little, preparing to stand up. Hawthorne said again, "What are you planning to do? Are you going to act? I advise you to calm down and think about your own position." Although I was stopped by Hawthorne's words, I could not restrain my anger. I wished I could rush forward and slap the villain in the face. Hawthorne said to me again in a low voice, "Calm down and look at them again." I turned my face and saw another peculiar action. The scheming young man was taking out a small violet velvet box, smiling and handing it to the woman opposite him. The woman opened the velvet box and looked at it carefully. A charming smile appeared on her face. I suddenly heard Hawthorne say to himself, "That's probably a ring. Including the velvet box, it's worth two or three dollars." I knew that our previous conjecture had been confirmed. The villain was indeed deceiving the woman with false pretenses. Before I could reply, I saw Qiu Kui from the next table turn his head and ask Hawthorne, "You called me here. What exactly is the matter?" Hawthorne also turned his body a little and replied, "According to you, you were not colluding with the traitor that night. Then, if you saw him, how would you deal with him?"</p>

<h3 id="e172">Slight Reaction in Gold Prices <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<h3 id="e173">Constantly Changing <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 22nd, gold prices saw a slight decline. The situation was fluctuating and had its ups and downs. The front and back markets totaled seven rounds of transactions. The result was a drop of one tael. It was the reverse direction after several days of consecutive increases. Most firms were generally selling, as the silver market saw gains. It fell slightly early in the morning, but then the buying side seemed strong, tending towards higher prices. As the foreign exchange had slight fluctuations, the gold price was also in a state of hesitation. Only the HSBC price remained unchanged. By noon, British gold seemed to be loosening, and with the selling atmosphere on the floor still strong, the price suddenly became weak. The afternoon market was weak but resilient, with large players engaging in some chasing purchases. The subsequent trend was still stable.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Hesitation in the Morning Market <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>From the opening of the July market in the early morning, it immediately fell one tael and one mace, totaling 775.8 taels. Because the big bars were long by three-sixteenths of an inch, but the silver price did not change, and neither did the private telegrams, the gold market did not see a major drop. It quickly rose back two taels, as Zhifeng, Yongchunyuan, Yongtianfeng, and Yong others came in, reaching 78 taels. As British gold was also good, initially settling at 6875, then 6875 to 625, Yuancheng, Yong Dadecheng, Dalian Gang, and others sold out, suddenly depreciating four taels, totaling 74.23 taels. At that time, Yuanmaoyong, Yongfeng, Bingxing, and others all came in, adding more than two taels, totaling 76.7 taels. When the announcement was made earlier, it was 76 taels, and the posted price did not change. The domestic market returned to even, and Qianchangxiang, Chunyuanyong, Changsheng, Yongdaxingyong, speculators, and others all sold off, gradually falling four taels, with only an up-and-down movement of one tael. At 10:15, it was 71.8 taels, and at 10:30, it was 4.1 taels, as Tianfengyong, Qianchangxiang, and goods with hedges came in. At 10:45, it retreated to 1.8 taels, and retail investors sold off. In an instant, it was raised again to 5.1 taels, because people's hearts were undecided, and buyers were slightly more numerous, it immediately went upward. At 11:00, it suddenly fell into a state of exhaustion, because Yucheng, Yong Bingxing, Yongfeng, Yuancheng, Fuxingyong, Jin'an, and others tended to sell off, falling four taels. It was especially so because British gold could be settled at 75. At 11:20, it finally settled at 71 taels. In an instant, Yongheng, Daxingyong, Yifengyong, Yuankangxiang, and Dalian Gang took advantage of this to chase in, suddenly jumping up five taels. At 11:50, it was 6.3 taels. Until the noon closing at 4.8 taels, Tongtaichang and goods sold out, so it was suppressed again to around 3 taels. The posted price was still counted at 811.8 taels, totaling a premium of 36 to 40 taels. The noon premium was 37-38 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Slight Decline in the End <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon opening was 73.2 taels, then only 1.2 taels, because the Indian exchange rate extended two or three annas, and the remaining wind after the noon closing, it slowly rose afterwards. The exchange rate seemed tight, and HSBC absorbed 75, while Mitsui and wheat firms sold at 6875. Fuchang, Yuancheng, Shenglong, Tianfengyong, and others chased in. At 3:00, it was 5.1 taels, and then there were one or two mace hovering. At 4:00, due to the activity of the sellers, and hearing that British gold could also be purchased at 6875 in the near future, it was suppressed to 73.67 taels. Suddenly, Yuanxingyong and Daxingyong entered the market and dragged it in, and people's hearts turned better. At 4:20, it rose to 76 taels. At the 4:30 closing, it was 75.7 taels, a decrease of 1.2 taels compared to the previous day. However, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, and Yuda all bought in a little, so after the closing, it was hyped up again to 77 taels. This was because there were few people at the banquet, so it immediately rose high with a lift. According to the whole city, the maximum price was 78 taels, and the minimum price was 71 taels, a difference of 7 taels. The early opening price of goods was 5.8 taels, the noon closing was 3 taels, the afternoon was 2.8 taels, and the closing was 6.5 taels. The posted prices were 40 taels and 36 taels. The registered prices were 73 taels for June and 75 taels for July. The supplementary water price was 71 taels, and 72 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Transaction Still Active <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The various firms traded, with Ji Yuanmao Yong, Xin Heng, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Kang Xiang, Yong Heng, Qian Chang Xiang, and Yu Da Jun entering more than selling. Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Xing Yong, and Da Xing Yong, Cui Chang Yong sold more than they bought. Heng Xing, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Yong Feng, Fu Tai Heng, Heng Yu, Chun Yuan Yong, and Da De Cheng saw very frequent transactions. Yuan Tai, Bing Xing, Yu Cheng Yong, and Fu Xing Yong all exited. In the afternoon, Tian Feng Yong, Fu Chang, Yuan Tai, Yuan Xing Yong, and Sheng Tai all entered. Wan Xing and Shun Li saw many sellers and few buyers. Yuan Kang Xiang and Zhi Feng Yong both exited.

The Guangdong group evened out in the morning market, with only over 200 bars. In the afternoon market, they entered 200 to 300 bars.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange in a Mediocre Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British silver rose, while the American silver remained unchanged. Transactions were scarce, and the market was flat. The HSBC exchange rate was listed, with only Hong Kong falling by 0.875, calculated at 80 taels and 0.0125, while nothing else changed. The buying and selling prices of banks fluctuated slightly, firm in the morning and loose later, returning to flat in the afternoon. Therefore, the premium also rose and fell by seven taels. However, the situation seemed vague, and the result was no different from the previous night. Chinese gold firms continued to engage in arbitrage, generally selling gold because arbitrage was still profitable. It seems that the banks' willingness to sell was also not idle. It is estimated that approximately over 200,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and a small amount of American gold was settled. Japanese gold was sold by the Dalian group to Mitsui, Taiwan, and others, amounting to several hundred thousand yuan. The overall market situation was peaceful.</p>

<p>Lishi Firm, Soft, and Unpredictable</p>
<h3 id="e181">Market Overview <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The market atmosphere was weak and transactions were sparse the day before yesterday, so market prices were generally soft. Yesterday morning, however, people's enthusiasm had not yet fully recovered, and the trend was chaotic. Compared with the early market, customer demand was slightly improved, and there was news of banks buying, which eventually led to prices tending to be firmer. As for the silver market, because the demand is far less than in previous years, it remains dull. Therefore, it is probably difficult to hope for superior performance in silver lending.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Interest Rate Prices <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>(Foreign Interest) The morning interest rate was 7 qian, 2 fen, 8 li, and 5 hao. The afternoon interest rate was 7 qian, 2 fen, 9 li, and 2.5 hao. The final result was only 0.375 hao better than the previous day's afternoon market. However, there was a difference of 0.75 between the morning and afternoon, indicating that the market atmosphere was firm and soft, with no constant state. (Silver Lending) Both the morning and afternoon markets were 4 fen, which was the same as the previous day's afternoon market. Because supply and demand were equal, the final result was only 0.2-0.3 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Auxiliary Coin Market Conditions <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Jiangnan small foreign coins: The morning market was 6 qian, 5 fen, and 5 li, which seemed to be 1 li better than the previous day, while the afternoon market remained the same, at 6 qian, 5 fen, and 4 li. 4,000 jiao were transacted in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins: The morning market was 6 qian, 4 fen, and 7.5 li, and the afternoon market was 6 qian, 4 fen, and 8.5 li. The afternoon market was 1 li better than the morning market and 1.5 li better than the previous day's afternoon market. 19 jiao were transacted in the morning market and 50,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,000 cash, to 380,000 cash.</p>

<p>Others fell about 0.6-0.7 jiao</p>
<p>Transactions totaled over 20 million yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the securities market saw scattered spot transactions, while the futures market was as active as before. The atmosphere was very lively. The market opened weak in the morning, with a general decline. Afterwards, the market conditions were chaotic, and people's minds were unsettled. Supply and demand were fairly balanced, so bond prices stabilized. There were no major fluctuations between each round. As a result, the price of 96 remained stable. Other than the slightly stronger Zheng Liu, the near-term of the compilation and dispatch fell by 2 yuan, and the next-month futures also fell by a small amount of 1.4 jiao. Other issues each fell by about 0.6-0.7 jiao. The total transaction volume of futures reached 2,010 million yuan. In addition, only 7,000 yuan of spot goods, such as Yi Jiu Guan, Er Ling Juan, and Zheng Liu, were traded.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Turned Down Again <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market fell again. The rumors about the current situation subsided, and people's hearts were gloomy. Although a certain merchant was prepared to receive a large amount of goods this month, there were also sufficient deliveries, so the pressure on the market was still heavy and difficult to rise. It hovered around the 160 tael mark, and the two sides competed fiercely. The current surrounding environment is very bad, but the bottom plate is too dry, so the decline is relatively smooth. Moreover, 20-count and 16-count yarn prices are still good, but the sales of 10-count coarse yarn are relatively sluggish. Therefore, new sellers are not very enthusiastic. However, the US cotton situation is very weak, and the sellers used this to suppress the market and throw out a lot. If the actual sales of coarse yarn can start, the market should have a turning point.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Manbiao Weakened, Falling by One to Two Taels <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the forward market was due to the fluctuating prices of US cotton at 1-2 pounds. People's sentiment was weak, and there was a lack of buyers in the market. Prices fell by 0.13, 0.14, and 0.15 taels. The opening of the afternoon market remained weak, but some absorbed far-month contracts, with near-month contracts falling by 0.02 taels and far-month contracts rising by 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08 taels. A total of 24,750 bales were traded. Shenxin sold 2,800 bales, Yi Da 800 bales, and Changfeng 1,000 bales. Yiyu 600 bales. Gongtai bought 750 bales, Shengtai 650 bales, Da Chang 600 bales, Taixing 450 bales, and Gengfeng 500 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

Fellow traders traded 180 bales, and the prices were flat. Among the customer gangs, the mainland bought 110 bales, Zhenjiang 45 bales, Guangdong 185 bales, Yunnan 280 bales, North Gang 60 bales, Tianjin 70 bales, Qinhuangdao 45 bales, Hankou 130 bales, Sichuan 130 bales, Gaoyang 65 bales, Fujian 40 bales, Qingdao 135 bales, and miscellaneous gangs 150 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is trending downward because deliveries are sufficient this month, Japanese merchants are swapping futures, and US cotton is fluctuating, causing people's sentiment to be flat and weak. The near term is slightly loose, and the far month is becoming increasingly weak, so the market is trending downward. In the afternoon, a certain manufacturer purchased at a limited price, and the situation suddenly tightened and rose. The cotton market is generally in a flat situation.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Hanbiao Slightly Declined <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>

<p>Following Du Mi, They Fell a Bit. The Price of Ke Xin Rice Dropped a Little over One Jiao.</p>
<p>The Price of Foreign Rice Dropped a Little over 0.05 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Ke Xin rice was still not good. After the prosperity from the river reached its peak, people's expectations had already weakened. Therefore, the market had been stagnant the day before yesterday. Yesterday, as the price of Du Mi dropped by a little over 0.02 or 0.03 yuan, the appetite in this street was even weaker. As a result, the owners voluntarily lowered the price for disposal, and about 1,400 bags were traded. The price was down a little over 0.15 yuan from the previous day, with asking prices ranging from 11.28 yuan to 10.095 yuan. There were no other transactions. Since the price of gold had increased, it was difficult for the price of foreign rice to be close, and the Shanghai market was weak, the importers were very discouraged. Yesterday, there was only a small amount of round-trip turnover of about 200 tons, with the June price being 5.3 taels, down a little over 0.05 yuan from the previous opening price.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening prices were set in the morning and afternoon, the market prices of each month generally trended towards a circling and flat decline. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell by about 0.03 or 0.04 yuan. Although it rained the night before, it was already clear yesterday, and most people seemed to be easing up. Generally, the floating amount had gradually shifted towards observation because the degree of increase had been considerable in the past few days of the week due to the circumstances. The situation for this month was still stable as the manufacturers had slightly increased their intake. Future months showed a soft trend as the customer gangs' thoughts were very weary, and many withdrew. In the future, it would be wise to temporarily set the trend, as the weather is still difficult to be optimistic about. As a result, the price for this month fell by 0.005 yuan compared to the previous day. June fell by 0.01 yuan, July fell by 0.0075 yuan, and August, September, and October fell by 0.0025 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the futures wheat market, after the opening prices were set in the morning and afternoon, the market prices of each month presented a phenomenon of being firm in the near term and flat in the distant term. Due to some traders being long on the current month, they had quite a bit of manipulation, so the market atmosphere was consistently firm and had a continuing upward trend, and the operators of the current months, had the bulk of the volume locked away, so the outside shorts were difficult to shake off. As for the various months in the distant term, the weather had turned clear, and the quoted price of foreign wheat had also decreased slightly, so there was a flat and soft trend. However, there would be many changes in the future if the new wheat harvest was not good. As a result, this month was 0.05 yuan better than the previous day, June was a little over 0.03 yuan lower, July and August were a little over 0.02 yuan lower, September was a little over 0.01 yuan lower, and October was a little over 0.02 yuan lower.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trading of silk by foreign firms in this port came to a complete standstill. The prices of silk in Europe, the United States, and China had fallen sharply, and the telegraphic transfer prices were surprisingly low. The losses for Chinese merchants were extremely large, making it difficult to sell. The market was holding its breath. Yesterday's silk dealers all had activity but no sales.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Most of the New Cocoons in Chang'an Have Thin Skins <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Unified Tugging is Only 30% As Good As In Prior Years... Cocoon Prices Have Already Risen to 50 Yuan In the villages near Chang'an, this year's early silkworms have suffered from the weather, and the late silkworms have been harmed by the severe cold and continuous rain. During the big sleep, 60-70% of the silkworms were discarded. New cocoons have already been put on the market, but the cocoon shops are only open to a little less than one-third of capacity. The number of goods arriving on the market is few. The unified tugging is only 30% as good as in prior years, and the quality of the cocoons is not good. Most of them have thin skins. Because of the rain, the arrival of goods on the market yesterday was even scarcer. The prices for high-quality cocoons have already opened at 50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Chunmee from Suian Has Already Opened <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market in this port, the new offers for Chunmee green tea from Suian, coming from the estates of firms such as Jinlong and Jardine Matheson, were formally opened at 125 taels, which was 10 taels higher than last year. However, the harvest from each region this year was poor, and the sales of the tea shops were huge, which increased the cost accordingly. Furthermore, the domestic Chunmee has fallen by 10-20 taels recently, and the sales are still not very smooth. It seems difficult to regard the green tea market trend as optimistic. The Yingde firms and other estates of Qimen black tea were still sparing no effort in searching and buying in the market yesterday. Because the arrival of goods has been scarce recently, the attitude of Chinese merchants has been hardening, and the market has been able to hold its ground fairly well. The offer from Jardine Matheson for Hekou black tea yesterday was 75 taels, which was over 20 taels higher than last year. However, this area does not produce much tea, and the supply cannot meet the demand. In the current tea market trend, black tea seems to be better than green tea.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Tea Market in Wubei is Bustling <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The new teas from Wuyi have been discussed and priced by various firms for days, with dozens of offers every day. The mountain households are separated from the discussions, and there are not many deals that are opened. Until today (15th), although the tea guests from the east, west, south, and north are discussing prices, there is not a single place where the scale has been opened. Only the tea shops in the north have opened their scales today, and the number of people running around to various villages to search for goods is actually more than the number of crucian carp crossing the river. In the area around Xichongyuan, there are as many as 40-50 traders gathering to discuss prices. A single tea is discussed, and the shares are divided among several firms. It is estimated that the villages where the scales have been opened today include Wang Village, Dawuqian, Changrao, Jiang Village, Changtan, Longteng, and more than a dozen others, with prices ranging from 42 to 45 yuan per load. Because each of the above villages had mountain households who suffered from the pain of delayed sales at lower prices last year, they did not want to insist on discussion prices excessively and repeat the mistakes. They are all willing to dispose of the goods early. Based on the current market trend, it has become lively. There are also some wealthy merchants who, in light of the tender goods and low prices of this year's tea leaves, have temporarily formed shops. It is estimated that the recent additions include two in Fengshan, two in Tuokou, one in Xigu, and one in Zhongyun. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Tea Market in Dewan is Affected by Bandits <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The new teas from Dexing and Wannian are in the peak season for entering the market. However, recently, there have been bandits harassing the border area of ​​Le De again, and the villages and towns newly built in Haikou are panicked. The tea shops that are opening to collect tea in De have stopped their activity. The tea merchants from Wuyuan are also mostly hesitant to move forward, and the tea market has come to a standstill. Because the bandits are causing trouble everywhere, it is difficult for mountain households to feel at ease in picking and producing new tea from Wannian, and most of the households will allow the leaves to become old on the trees, which has greatly reduced the amount of production. In addition, since the tea leaves in this area have always been inferior, there are few people who collect tea leaves, and the market is even more depressed. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Reasons for the Price Drop of Cotton Fabrics <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The prices of woolen goods and cotton fabrics have been steadily falling recently. As the exchange rate has become tighter, the import cost of cotton fabrics has increased instead of decreasing. The selling price should logically increase, but the demand is weak, making it difficult to raise the price. The reasons for the repeated price drops, according to the investigation, are that a large number of cotton fabrics from Hong Kong and Dalian have been shipped to Shanghai in the past month. The selling prices are more than one point cheaper than in Shanghai. This is because imports from these two ports can avoid tariffs. This is why the market price of cotton fabrics in this port has become weak.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Rebar Turns Strong from Weak <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>After the outlet for rebar was dismal, the market situation was exceptionally idle. The standards fell again and again, so the lowest price was estimated to be 93 taels per ton. In recent days, the exchange rate has tended to decrease, people's sentiments have returned, and the selling price has increased. It is estimated that it can be sold for up to 95 taels per ton. It is estimated that the number of bars in the market yesterday was 600-700 tons, which were bought by construction workers. The export gangs such as the Yangtze River and inland river ports have also shipped goods.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Galvanized Iron Increases by 0.01 Yuan <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The recent trading of 36-inch and 37-inch Dongyang galvanized iron has been very lively, but the amount of goods on the market is limited. After the goods were collected, the scarcity became even more apparent. Therefore, the standards have increased by 0.01 yuan. The selling price of 37-inch galvanized iron is 1.26 taels per sheet, and the selling price of 36-inch galvanized iron is 1.06 taels per sheet. According to the investigation, there were 4,000-5,000 sheets in transactions in the market yesterday. The buyers were all from the Yangtze River gang, and other gangs only had a few transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e204">[Resumption of Business in the Concessions P] <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, after receiving an official letter from the Municipal Finance Bureau requesting it to find ways to persuade the fresh meat industry to resume business, yesterday convened a meeting of representatives from the fresh meat trade association, presided over by Chairman Wang Xiaolai and Executive Committee members Wang Yansong and Zheng Chengqing. They offered assurances to coordinate and mediate after the industry resumes operations. The association accepted the advice, agreeing that businesses in the concessions should uniformly resume slaughtering today and start operations. At the same time, they dispatched personnel to various shops to provide guidance. It is reported that meat merchants will start importing goods today in preparation for resuming operations, with fresh meat expected to be available in the market tomorrow.</p>
<p>U.S. Export Statistics for March</p>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General in this city has released figures for exports from all of China and Hong Kong to the United States for March. The value of goods for which consulate invoices were filed totaled US$1,013,670. The total for the first three months of this year is US$3,704,702. Textiles and raw materials accounted for the largest share, with exports valued at US$513,126 in March and US$2,379,978 for the first three months. Non-edible animal products were second, with exports valued at US$308,875 in March and US$775,917 for the first three months. The remaining exports were of much smaller value, not exceeding several tens of thousands of US dollars in March. However, according to new regulations by the U.S. Treasury Department, only goods subject to ad valorem duties now require consulate invoices. The consulate is unable to collect statistics for goods that are duty-free or subject to special taxes in the United States. Therefore, the aforementioned export figures do not represent the entirety of our country's exports to the United States.</p>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang Goes to Hangzhou</p>
<p>Return to Fujian Undecided</p>
<p>Naval Minister and Fujian Province Chairman Yang Shuzhuang, after attending a meeting in Beijing, came to Shanghai and stayed at his residence on Avenue Joffre. He had originally planned to return to Fujian immediately, but Chen Peikun, a Fujian provincial committee member who came with him from Fujian, went to Pingjin and Tai'an with Wu Shan and has not yet returned to Shanghai. Therefore, taking advantage of this free time, he also took a train to Hangzhou the night before last for sightseeing. His return to Fujian is therefore undecided. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency received news from naval circles yesterday, saying that the Pu'an warship is still awaiting orders in the Songkou port, likely waiting for Yang and Chen to return from Shandong and Hangzhou before going to Fujian together, which will probably delay them for another week.</p>

<p>Sixth District Party Headquarters Supports Abolition of Unequal Treaties Declaration</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Sixth District Party Headquarters declared: (Abridged) Our nation's survival does not depend on perfect territories, but is controlled by foreign aggressors of political or economic aggression. Thus, every blade of grass and every tree of ours, no matter what, is flesh on the knives of imperialists. Every thread and every building of ours, no matter which end, is an adornment of blue-eyed boys or purple-skirted attendants. But let us ask, why is our solemn and brilliant Chinese civilization reduced to remnants below the eighteenth level of hell today? If we think about it even a little, anyone can say in unison, this is thanks to the blessings of unequal treaties. Therefore, our nation's poverty and weakness are absolutely not the result of famines or internal strife, but rather the crystallization of what has been left by unequal treaties. From this, we know that the existence of unequal treaties is by no means a matter of individual honor or disgrace, but rather a watershed between the rise and fall of the Republic of China. Moreover, it is not only a small key to a nation's survival, but also the only fuse for East Asian security and global order. If we continue to tolerate them and allow them to continue to exist, not only will our descendants be slaves, accumulating contracts of servitude for countless kalpas, but our East Asian situation and world trends will also suffer serious collateral damage due to the disappearance of our national spirit. Therefore, our abolition of unequal treaties is neither making a merciless conflict with imperialists, nor is it an attempt to exploit a topic with the ambition to invade the world, but rather it is completely standing on the level playing field of international equality and demanding a self-determined path of national independence, political independence, and economic independence. We deeply know that selfish and self-interested imperialists may not respect our popular will and follow the trend of the world, and have the determination to voluntarily abandon unequal treaties. Therefore, we really have no second way except to save ourselves from danger, save ourselves from destruction, and free ourselves from shackles. Now, how fortunate that our National Congress can promote the indomitable national spirit under the guidance of the blue and white banner,</p>
<p>Page 14</p>
<p>so that the intangible prison that the public has suffered for decades can have the possibility of restoring freedom through the blowing of this abolition of unequal treaties declaration. What a happy thing this is. However, the abolition of inequality in words alone may still be insufficient to seize the fierce flames of the strong. Therefore, we further hope that the diplomatic authorities will carry out the proposition of abolishing the treaty based on the public opinion of the people. At the same time, we also hope that the government and the public will work together and not let the five minutes of enthusiasm retain this bloody title for a long time. That is our only way to survive. Salutations from the Executive Committee of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>

<p>Minutes of the Shanghai Municipal Council Meeting</p>
<p>Approval of Municipal Chinese Advisor and Chinese Affairs Assistant</p>
<p>The Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council, at its regular meeting on Wednesday, decided to appoint Wu Jingxiong as Municipal Advisor and He Dekui as Chinese Affairs Assistant, which was reported in the previous newspaper. The Municipal Council officially released the minutes of the meeting yesterday, with the details as follows:</p>
<p>Water Supply Expert</p>
<p>Those present at the meeting were Chairman Macnaghten, Vice-Chairman Sperling, and directors Peel, Bland, Carneck, Fukushima, Xu Xinliu, Xu Shi, Okamoto, Raven, Hu Mengjia, Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, as well as Secretary-General Fessenden and Acting Secretary-General Mackie. Macnaghten presided over the meeting and first reported that he had received a telegram from water supply expert Schell, informing him that he could not leave the United States before August 15. The Municipal Council immediately telegraphed back, urging him not to postpone his trip beyond August 15 and asking him to telegraph the exact date of his arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Implementation of Factory Law</p>
<p>Next, the issue of implementing factory regulations in the concessions was discussed. Secretary-General Fessenden read a letter from the Senior Consul and the Municipal Council's reply, and reported to the board that the Chinese authorities had invited three experts from the League of Nations in Geneva to come to Shanghai to study the regulations and their implementation.</p>
<p>Appointment of Chinese Staff</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman reported that a special committee had met on Monday and unanimously decided that the Municipal Council should appoint two senior Chinese staff members: one as Municipal Advisor and one as Chinese Assistant Secretary. Regarding the candidates for Municipal Advisor and Chinese Affairs Assistant, although many people had submitted letters of recommendation to the Municipal Council, the Chinese directors unanimously recommended Dr. Wu Jingxiong to take on the position of Municipal Advisor. Although Mr. Wu did not submit a letter of recommendation himself, he had served as a judge and acting president of the Provisional Court and was well-qualified. The Chinese directors also recommended Mr. He Dekui as Chinese Assistant Secretary. The matter was then discussed and approved.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Changxing Coal Mine Company Meeting</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Request Return</p>
<p>The fifth general meeting of the National Congress passed a resolution to return private enterprises. Zhejiang's Changxing Coal Mine is also on the list of mines to be returned. At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Changxing Coal Mine Company convened a temporary emergency meeting of the Mineral Resources Committee to request its return. Committee members Liu Wanqing, Yi Nanzhen, Ming Runshun, Liu Zhixiang, Ye Danian, Yu Shouchun, and more than 30 important shareholders discussed the implementation plan. It was unanimously decided to publicly nominate Chairman Liu Wanqing to request the Construction Committee to return the mine as soon as possible to maintain commerce and protect property rights.</p>
<p>Shanghai Coal Industry Appeals on Behalf of Shandong Mining Merchants</p>
<p>Request to Order Jiaoji Railway to Cancel Price Increase</p>
<p>The Coal Industry Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Railways: "To Minister of the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing: We have recently received a telegram from the Shandong Zibo and Weifang Mining Coal Industry Association stating that the Jiaoji Railway, in terms of mining coal freight rates, disregards the development of national coal, does not care about the life and death of miners, and ignores all interests, resolutely deciding to suddenly increase mining coal freight rates by 40% in just two years, forcing the mining industry to be unable to support itself. Therefore, the Shandong Zibo and Weifang mining coal industries convened a general meeting and decided to temporarily suspend operations on May 21 to await further orders, and telegraphed for assistance, etc., which has arrived in Shanghai. Upon investigation, when the Jiaoji Railway increased prices last year, our association duly requested the restoration of the old regulations to facilitate coal transportation and received approval No. 591, stating that the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee submitted a report stating that the supply and demand of coal in various parts of Shandong Province have been corresponding in recent months and that the coal and coke freight rates of the railway have been restored on November 1, and the ministry issued instructions to approve the record. With this approval, coal merchants celebrated that the government could adopt public opinions and that the development of mining merchants was promising. Unexpectedly, the ink was not yet dry, and in an instant, there was an increase of 20% on May 1 this year. Our association has already submitted a request to exempt the increase on May 4 to encourage mining merchants and facilitate sales, and two weeks have passed, but there has been no reply. The fear of danger and doubt is always in our minds. Now, unfortunately, Shandong mines have suspended operations, which means that tens of millions of lives along the Jiaoji Railway line will be trapped at the same time, and the severity of the disaster cannot be described in words. Even more unfortunately, Shandong mines did not suspend operations during the warlord era, nor did they suspend operations during the war, but they suspended operations at the moment when military administration was unified and the people's assembly closed. It is truly a shocking innovation. How can all our citizens ignore it? All members of our association, who are engaged in coal, have a close relationship with coal mining merchants, and if we do not urgently make a plea for survival, we are sitting idly by while Shandong mines and tens of millions of lives along the Jiaoji Railway line are trapped in desperation. In the event that national coal is cut off, the industrial, commercial, and transportation sectors must completely demand foreign coal to maintain operations, and economic leakage will be even worse than before, and the industrial plan will be hopeless. Looking at the future, the hidden worries are extremely deep. We hereby telegraphed to appeal, requesting your ministry to take care of the people's suffering, urgently provide relief, and immediately order the Jiaoji Railway authorities to cancel the price increase and persuade the mining merchants to resume operations to stabilize the miners and maintain the status quo. As for the railway's income problem, we request that the railway be ordered to prepare more vehicles and transport as much as possible, so the income will be abundant and the economy will be prosperous. The above requests are all urgently awaiting your approval. Salutations from the Shanghai Coal Industry Association."</p>
<p>Request Exemption of Business Tax for Western-Style Machine-Made Goods</p>
<p>Shanghai Machinery Association Sends Telegram to Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories yesterday sent a document to the Ministry of Finance requesting exemption from business tax for machine-made Western-style goods, stating: "Regarding the matter of machine-made Western-style goods that have been approved for exemption from business tax, in the late Qing Dynasty, there were precedents for reducing or exempting taxes and customs duties. On June 11 of the ninth year of the Republic of China, the Taxation Department of the former Beijing government jointly formulated nine articles of the current method of taxing machine-made Western-style goods, and Article 2 of Chapter 1 was added in February of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China to show restrictions. It has been used for more than ten years, so recently the number of factories manufacturing machine-made Western-style goods has gradually increased, and imported goods among daily necessities have gradually decreased. Inspecting the 'General Situation of Shanghai Industry' compiled and printed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, which details the development statistics of machine factories, we know the reasons. First, it is due to the government's preferential treatment for machine-made goods, giving various conveniences to machine-made national goods factories; second, it is due to the success of the Xinhai Revolution, which allowed the people to recover from poverty and strive for the development of national goods; third, it is due to the opportunity of the European War, when foreign goods were unable to come, so national goods could develop freely and gain the trust of the people. From the end of the Guangxu period to the 17th year of the Republic of China, the establishment of machine factories has increased from dozens of factories to 1,441 factories, which is clear evidence. Recently, due to the government's revision of the tax system, the abolition of all customs duties, and the revision of import and export taxes, each province and city collects business tax to compensate for the deficit. Among the small tax items, there is a provision for collecting 0.2% of business tax for manufacturing industries, such as papermaking, cotton textiles, hemp textiles, box making, enamelware, etc., which are all machine-made goods. Upon investigation, machine-made goods were originally imitated to resist the invasion of foreign goods, and most of their raw materials still rely on imports, which have already borne heavy central taxes, so their enjoyment of reduced or exempted other taxes and fees is also a deserved benefit. Although customs duties have recently been abolished, if business tax is levied again, the benefits enjoyed by the machine-made industry for decades will be abolished at once, and the young industry will inevitably be unable to bear the burden. Taking Shanghai as an example, a detailed statistical review of the capital of 1,441 machine factories of Chinese merchants shows that the wealth is not as good as the capital of 56 machine factories of Japanese residents, which can be seen in general. How to work hard to improve and how to maintain it without collapse are still without a decision to follow. Today, with the increase in the burden of business tax, the collapse of Chinese merchant factories can be expected. Moreover, since business tax is used to compensate for customs duties, machine-made goods should be exempt from customs duties according to the original plan, and business tax should be exempted in principle to show fairness. Therefore, we specially submit this request, hoping that your ministry will approve the exemption of business tax according to the previous examples of preferential treatment for machine factories, so as to protect and promote it, which is truly a matter of public convenience. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>Restriction on Special Tax Collection for Silk Bonds</p>
<p>Request Only Levy Factory-Run Silk</p>
<p>Exempt from Raw Silk, etc.</p>
<p>The issuance of 8 million yuan in Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry bonds has been announced and implemented by the National Government's Executive Yuan. The Ministries of Finance and Industry have separately appointed Mu Ouchu, Zou Bingwen, Song Ziliang, etc., as members of the committee in charge of allocating bond amounts and managing funds. They are preparing to jointly organize a specialized committee with representatives from silk factories and financial circles in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai to carry out the project. However, the committee regulations and implementation details have been drafted and agreed upon by the Ministries of Finance and Industry and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. Since the National Congress has just closed, it must wait until next Tuesday to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation before the committee members can follow them. The Jianghai Customs has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to collect a special tax of 30 yuan per dan of yellow and white silk exported from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces starting from the 20th of this month to be allocated to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry bond fund. This has caused panic among silk merchants in Jili, Zhejiang Province. The issuance of 8 million yuan in Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry bonds is only to provide relief to factory-run silk businesses in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and has nothing to do with silk merchants in Jili and other places. It is inappropriate to include yellow and white silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in the customs' collection of heavy taxes. Therefore, Shen Huachen, chairman of the specialized committee for relief to silk factory businesses in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, has now submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to clearly stipulate that a special tax of 30 yuan per dan will be collected for yellow and white factory-run silk exported from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and raw silk, etc., will be exempt from the tax to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Box Tea Begins Transport to Shanghai</p>
<p>Box tea produced in Jinqu, Yan, Shangjiang, and other places in Zhejiang Province has been transported to Shanghai by the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway for export overseas. This year's new box tea has now been put on the market for transportation. Yesterday, 1,024 boxes of new box tea were transported by the Lubao Shuntai Transfer Company in Zhabei. All of them were transported to the South Station to unload the cars and sent to the Yuanji Foreign Warehouse on Suzhou River in North Shanghai for storage, customs declaration, and export. It is reported that the export sales of box tea this year seem to have increased compared to last year, but due to heavy taxes, business is quite difficult. The industry has submitted a request to the authorities to reduce the tax.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Protects Tung Oil Export Sales</p>
<p>Request to Reduce Export Tax Rate</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: On the 21st of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Oil and Hemp Industry Association stating that the new export tariff rates announced by the Ministry of Finance estimate the taxable price of tung oil at 210.99, and the tax rate is 7.5%, with a levy of 1 tael and 6 qian of Customs silver. It is noted that the valuation is based on the value in 1929. The original export tariff rates estimated the taxable price of tung oil at 6 taels, with a tax rate of 5%, amounting to a levy of 3 qian of Customs silver, plus a 2.5% surtax of 1 qian and 5 fen, totaling 4 qian and 5 fen of silver. Now that the surtax has been removed, the regular tax has actually increased to 2.56 times, which is shocking. Moreover, it is unfair to use the highest price in 1929 as the tax standard. At a time when export business is declining, the sudden increase in tax rates is unbearable for merchants. Our association believes that there is a need for revision. We have already telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to revise the tax rates lightly and re-estimate the taxable prices. We have always admired your association as the hub of the city's commerce and have conveyed the letter accordingly. Please forward it to the Ministry of Finance to revise the tax rules, which is a matter of public gratitude, and copy the original telegram to the association. Upon investigation, the sale of tung oil abroad has always been dominated by our country's products in the market. Since Americans planted tung trees in their own country to resist it, the annual production has increased dramatically, from 1,700 tons to 15,000 tons. It can be predicted that the future sales of Chinese tung oil abroad will be invaded by Indian and Ceylon products, and American tung oil will be fiercely competitive. Thereafter, the market price will only tend to fall, and there is no reason to return to the prosperity of 1929. The new tax rules, which are more than 2.5 times heavier than the old ones, will inevitably lead to increased costs in foreign trade and make it more difficult. According to the letter, it is reasonable to telegraph your ministry to assess the situation. Please consider that our country's export of tung oil is no longer comparable to the exclusive market a few years ago, and try to protect it. Re-evaluate and revise this export tariff rate, or change the ad valorem tax to a quantity tax, so as to suit the current market situation and not cause excessive burden on exporters. The national economy and people's livelihood will benefit. Salutations from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Shanghai Liquor Inspection Office Restored</p>
<p>Director Song Jiju Has Taken Office</p>
<p>The Shanghai Liquor Inspection Office, formerly attached to the Second District Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau of Jiangsu Province, was virtually eliminated after the bureau was abolished. Now, the Ministry of Finance has found that the inspection office has been effective since its establishment and that the inspection should be restored as counterfeit liquor is harming public health. Therefore, the Jiangsu Stamp and Alcohol Bureau has ordered the Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau Director Song Jiju to concurrently serve as the Director of the Liquor Inspection Office, and he took office the day before yesterday and has dispatched personnel to conduct inspections.</p>
<p>County Rural Clearance Bureau Abolished Yesterday</p>
<p>Shanghai County's rural clearance affairs have expired after three months. Therefore, in addition to holding a meeting on the 25th of this month to discuss the conclusion, the County Rural Clearance Bureau was ordered by Director Yan to be abolished immediately yesterday to carry out the conclusion. All unfinished matters will be transferred to the county government for handling. The six sub-bureaus under its jurisdiction were also ordered to be abolished immediately, and the unfinished matters were handed over to the district offices for handling. At the same time, the situation of rural clearance in this county will be reported to the Jiangsu Rural Clearance Headquarters for verification.</p>
<p>Liu Shufan to Return to Shanghai to Cancel Leave</p>
<p>Liu Shufan, Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, took leave to visit his sick mother in Fujian Province. The bureau affairs were handled by Associate Director Shen Shuyu. The bureau has been in constant contact with him by letter and telegram. Recently, a telegram from him stated that his mother's illness has turned for the better and is expected to recover. He plans to return to the bureau to cancel his leave on the next available ship and will arrive in Shanghai within a few days.</p>
<p>Drug Resistance Association Prepares for June 3rd Anniversary</p>
<p>June 3rd is the 92nd anniversary of the ban on opium by our country's drug resistance pioneer Lin Zexu. The year before last, Wang Jingqi, chairman of the China National Drug Resistance Association, submitted a request to the National Government to designate this day as the Anti-Smoking Memorial Day to show commendation. The National Government issued a circular to all provinces, cities, and counties, ordering them to convene local organizations and groups on this day every year to hold commemorations to show commendation and encourage them. Over the years, the association has issued circulars to local drug resistance organizations to jointly prepare for the event with local party and government agencies. As the date of the memorial is approaching, the association specially formulated a plan yesterday and sent it to various places, ordering them to prepare quickly and hold the event on schedule, and made a large number of propaganda materials to meet the needs of local commemorations. In addition, Shanghai is the focus of attention at home and abroad, and it is not enough to hold a large-scale event to show our country's determination to resist drugs. The association specially sent personnel to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government yesterday to discuss joint preparations, and the results were very satisfactory. A meeting of representatives of various legal entities will be convened within a few days to join the preparations so that it can be held on a large scale at that time.</p>

<p>Counterfeit Customs Treasury Bills Discovered on the Market</p>
<p>Eighteenth-Year Customs Treasury Bills</p>
<p>Exquisitely Printed, Almost Indistinguishable from Genuine Bills</p>
<p>Police Have Already Arrested Two People</p>
<p>Confessions Indicate the Bills Came from Xiangtan</p>
<p>Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, five years have passed. However, due to frequent internal disturbances over the years, coupled with the simultaneous launch of various construction projects, the need for funds is pressing, and the treasury is empty. To avoid having nothing to cook with, the only plan is to issue national bonds to provide financial support. Therefore, the bonds issued successively over the years have numerous names. Although the amount is no less than several thousand million, the payment of interest and repayment of principal have never been delayed, the fund is stable, and the management is proper. As a result, credit is evident, the market is circulating, and no accidents have occurred. However, recently, some traitors, only seeking private gain and disregarding national credit, dared to counterfeit the eighteenth-year Customs Treasury Bills for deceptive use. The financial authorities were not initially aware of it until Renyi Money Shop in this city received two of these bills, worth two yuan each, sent from Bengbu, and transferred them to Wang Dazong, an official of the Central Bank, for identification. After confirming that they were counterfeit, he reported to the president, who submitted it to the Ministry of Finance. Only then did they learn that counterfeit bills had been discovered outside. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance issued a circular to the Central, China, and Communications Banks, informing branches in various locations to pay attention to the matter and to secretly investigate the counterfeiters. Once they were found, they were to be arrested and severely punished. As for the counterfeit bills discovered this time, according to detailed identification by the Customs Office of the Ministry of Finance, the printing was very exquisite, and the colors and patterns on both sides of the bills were no different from genuine bills. However, upon closer inspection, the Chinese characters on the front of the counterfeit bills were slightly different from those on the genuine bills. Without this flaw, the counterfeit bills could have been mistaken for genuine bills, and it would have been difficult to distinguish between them. After receiving this news, the silver and money industry and the securities market began to pay close attention to the eighteenth-year Customs Treasury Bills. However, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Luo Yizhai, an accountant from Yiqingxiang, a shop located at 366 Taipingfang, Hankou Road, also ordered a tea servant named Yao Amao to take sixteen of these counterfeit bills to the Bank of China to exchange for 32 yuan in cash. After the bank staff discovered it, they reported it to the General Patrol Room, which dispatched Detective Wu Chunrong to arrest Yao along with the counterfeit bills. Then they arrested Yao. Yesterday morning, they escorted them to the Special District Local Court. Wang Yaotang, a police lawyer, charged Luo and Yao with forgery of documents under Article 233, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. Zhao Songlu, specially dispatched by the Customs Office, went to court to explain in detail the differences between the genuine and counterfeit bills. Luo confessed that the bills were sent by a Mr. Wen from the Tongqingxiang Silk Shop in Xiangtan, who entrusted him to cash them. He has now telegraphed to inquire about their origin and has hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Xu instructed both defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the trial for seven days. According to Zhao's statement in court, the counterfeit bills were manufactured very exquisitely, and one would be fooled if they were not careful. If they had not been in circulation for long, there would be no major harm. On the contrary, the number of people who might be fooled and suffer losses could be considerable.</p>
<p>Postal Service Dismisses Employee for Forging Receipts and Committing Fraud</p>
<p>Soliciting Parcel Postages</p>
<p>Carrying Back for Embezzlement</p>
<p>Li Zuoming, a native of Ningbo, used to work in the parcel department of the Post Office. Later, he was dismissed by the director for dereliction of duty and has been unemployed since then. Over the years, his livelihood has become extremely difficult, so he resorted to illegal activities. He rented a room on the second floor of No. 31 Qipu Road, soliciting parcel postages from various shops. According to the articles mailed, the procedures were complicated, and unless one was skilled, errors would occur. Li had been in this business for a long time and was not only familiar with the matter but also proficient in the way to commit fraud. Therefore, after receiving a parcel for mailing, he would often carry it back to his residence and examine the type of goods. If it was necessary to pay customs duties, he would affix a customs duty form that he had forged to the package and then mail it. He would also overreport the fees to the consignor and pocket the proceeds. This kind of fraudulent act has now been detected by the Post Office, and they have sent inspectors to conduct a thorough investigation. The day before yesterday, it was finally found out, and the Hongkou Patrol Room was notified, and Detectives Mao Yiwen and Bao Tan Hechengrui went to Li's residence. At that time, Li was writing a counterfeit receipt, and his friend Xu Linxiang, a shop assistant from a stationery store at No. 84 Qipan Street, was sitting next to Li, holding a genuine receipt from the Post Office so that Li could imitate it. Shui Quanxiang, an employee of Yuantai Forwarding Company at No. 386 Shanxi Road, was also arrested because he sent goods to Li's place and asked Li to mail them on his behalf. Li confessed to forging the tax-paid slip and other details and confessed that the fake seal was hidden at No. 107 O' Jia Road, and the receipt was entrusted to Xieqing Printing House at No. 94 Datong Road, Zhabei. The detectives first went and took out the seal, and then went to the printing house for a search, but the owner had already fled. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Li and the other three people and various forged items to the Special District Local Court. Judge Xiao interrogated them. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the circumstances of the case and presented the items seized. Among them was a receipt with the freight fee filled in for 19 yuan and 5 jiao. However, according to the weight of the goods, it would only cost 7 yuan and 5 jiao to mail it directly to the Post Office. From this one point, it can be seen that Li's income was not enough. Later, according to Li's confession, because he could not make a living, he used this to make a small profit. Xu confessed that he asked Li for a debt of two yuan, and he did not participate in Li's fraud and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him. Shui confessed that he was a friend of Li and just went to chat, which led to the implication. The judge ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<p>Further Hearing in the Ni Guangxun Missing Person Property Dispute Case</p>
<p>Court Orders Reconciliation within Two Weeks</p>
<p>After the disappearance of Ni Guangxun, a student at Chih Tze University, Fan Abao, who used to be a kitchen maid in the Ni family, claimed to be Guangxun's wife and filed a lawsuit against Ni's sister, Ni Zengshi, for occupying Guangxun's family property. The Special District Local Court summoned the defendant, who hired lawyers Zhang Deqin and Shen Yuesheng to defend and absolutely denied that Abao was his sister-in-law and that he had occupied his brother's property. Abao then asked Ni Guangxun's uncle, Ni Wenming, to be brought to court, which could prove it. The judge ordered the plaintiff to pay additional litigation fees and wait for Ni Wenming to be brought to court for questioning. This has been reported in the previous two newspapers. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing of the case. Ni Wenming did not obey the summons to appear in court, but only sent a letter and sent someone to the court. The letter generally stated that he was old and sick, closed his door to recuperate, and could not move, so it was difficult to obey the order to appear in court for confrontation. As for the point of contention in this case, according to what he knew, Guangxun had three brothers, and Guangxun was the youngest and had not been formally married. When Guangxun's father died, he made a will distributing the property to his sons. He did not know whether Guangxun's share had been used up for his studies because he had lived apart from them for more than 40 years. Therefore, the lawyers hired by the defendant, Zhang and Shen, claimed that what was stated in the letter was true, but the plaintiff still insisted on his previous claims and did not give in. Then, Judge Yang ordered the case to be rescheduled and advised the two parties to go out and reconcile within two weeks. If it is still not resolved when the deadline expires, the plaintiff should pay the litigation fees and wait for the hearing to continue.</p>
<p>Danyang Kidnappers Arrested in Shanghai</p>
<p>Li Wenxiang Allowed to Be Transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Kidnappers Zhou Yaoqi, Zhao Jintai, Li Wenxiang, etc., colluded with Shen Shanyuan in February this year to kidnap a five-year-old son surnamed Wang and a nine-year-old son surnamed Li from Danyang County and hid them in the Zhao bandit's house in Xinchangli, Hongkou. They also sent letters to the families of the two children, demanding ransom. The ransom was 10,000 yuan for Wang's child and 8,000 yuan for Li's child. The families received the letters and each sent someone to Shanghai to secretly negotiate at the Luoyanglou Teahouse near the North Railway Station. Because the amounts were very different, no agreement was reached. Recently, Shen Bandit has been arrested by the Danyang County Government and confessed that his accomplices were all hiding in Shanghai. The county government specially consulted the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to investigate and arrest them. The day before yesterday, detectives arrested Zhou Bandit and went to the Harbin Patrol Room to secretly go to Xinchangli with Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Zhao Bandit and the two children. Unexpectedly, Zhao had already fled upon hearing the news, and the two children had also been abducted elsewhere. Later, Zhou Bandit was interrogated to find out the whereabouts of Li Bandit, who confessed that he lived at No. 7 Harbin Road. So the detective went to the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room at about 2:00 AM yesterday morning and worked with the detectives to go to arrest Li and Li's wife, Wei. Then, a suspect named Liu Dehuai was arrested in Xinchangli. They were all escorted to the Special District Local Court at 9:00 AM. Judge Ge interrogated them. Qin Bin, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, went to court to request extradition, while Zhang Tianyin, a police lawyer, stated that unless it was proven that Li Wenxiang was related to the kidnapping case, the police had objections to the extradition. Judge Ge questioned the defendants, who all denied kidnapping. As a result, Li Wenxiang was handed over to Qin Bin and taken to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Liu Dehuai and Li Wei were remanded in custody and ordered to submit additional evidence and reschedule the hearing.</p>

<p>Qian Zhaofu, the owner of Yongfeng Wood Shop in Nanshi, went out of his concubine's home at No. 17 Hehefang, Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession on the evening of the 14th of last month. He was about to take his own car when he was kidnapped by several bandits and taken away. Later, the family of the victim received a letter from the bandits, demanding a ransom of 30,000 yuan, and made an appointment to negotiate and pay the ransom on the Great West Road. The matter was detected by Jin Jiulin, the special detective inspector of the French Patrol Room, and the detectives Li Yaolong, Qian Yumin, Mao Jingen, Zhang Ziying, Qin Youyu, Xu Guilin, etc., disguised as negotiators and went to the Great West Road to arrest the kidnappers Yang Defu, Luo Er'er, also known as Luo</p>

<p>Chen Youren and His Wife Travel on the Same Ship</p>
<p>Obeying Central Government Orders to Explain in Person</p>
<p>Sun Ke, Minister of Railways, accompanied by his wife and several attendants, indeed departed for Guangdong on the Asama Maru of the Japan Mail Steamship Company at 4:30 AM the day before yesterday. Sun and others left their residence on Route Molière by car at 10:30 PM on the 20th and boarded the ship at the Huishan Wharf at around 11:00 PM. Also traveling to Guangdong on the same ship were former Foreign Minister Chen Youren and his wife. Chen had been staying at the Claremont Hotel at the western end of Route Lafayette and Rue Pichon in Shanghai. According to the hotel's servants, Mr. and Mrs. Chen had been staying there for about three months and only moved out on the evening of the 20th, taking a car to the Huishan Wharf to board the Asama Maru for Hong Kong. Our reporter especially visited Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry, who came to Shanghai to mediate the Guangdong situation. According to his conversation, Sun Zhesheng is very willing to mediate the Guangdong situation. Although he telegraphed Guangdong twice from Shanghai, asking them to consider the overall situation, he still felt that it would be difficult to quickly explain the talks unless he went to Guangdong in person to explain. The central government also expressed sympathy for this. Therefore, Sun's trip to Guangdong was actually dispatched by the central government and bears the responsibility of mediation.</p>

<p>The Seventh and Ninth District Party Departments of this city issued telegrams yesterday regarding the Guangdong situation, which are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e211">Declaration of the Seventh District Party Department <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>(Heading omitted) Looking back at the success of our party's National Revolution, it was due to the efforts of hundreds of thousands of revolutionary comrades, the support of the entire population, and the price paid by countless soldiers who sacrificed their heads and hot blood. Recently, the central government, in accordance with the Premier's will, convened a National Assembly in the capital, gathering talents from all over the country in one hall to discuss national affairs. After more than ten days, the results were satisfactory, and the resolutions passed were all important points for the country's economy and people's livelihood, which should be promoted and reformed. From then on, the people of the whole country will be of one heart and one mind, hoping to strive to realize them in an orderly manner, so that the Premier's Three Principles of the People can be completed, and the Chinese nation can enjoy the happiness of freedom and equality. Unexpectedly, out of the blue, the four members of the Deng, Lin, Xiao, and Gu committees, at the beginning of the National Assembly, with ulterior motives, picked up floating words and rashly sent a telegram, groundlessly insulting our hardworking and meritorious Chairman Chiang. At the close of the conference, Comrade Chen Jitang, without investigation, echoed blindly and responded indiscriminately, and there was news of military action. Such boldness and recklessness are suspected of following in the footsteps of reactionary warlords. Furthermore, the domestic communists have not been completely eliminated, and the abolition of treaties is in progress. It is time to rely on common efforts, how can we start wars again and plunge the country into an unmanageable situation? Our party department dares to represent the comrades in this district to advise Chief Commander Chen and the members of the Deng, Gu, and Lin committees to rein in their horses, correct their mistakes, and make a final loyal warning. We hereby declare that we hope that all sectors of the country will unanimously advocate. If Chen, Gu, and others are obsessed, they can only request the central government to order a crusade. Our humble sincerity is submitted for your public consideration. (Omission below)</p>
<h3 id="e212">Telegram of the Ninth District Party Department <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>(Omission above) The success of the National Revolution lies first in construction, and the completion of construction lies in peace. At this time when military administration has just been completed and political tutelage has begun, the people of the whole country are eagerly looking forward to governance. The central government, in accordance with the Premier's legacy, convened the National Assembly and formulated a provisional constitution. The people of the whole country should be of one heart and one mind, seeking long-term stability and security, and striving to build the Three Principles of the People. Unexpectedly, supervisory committee members such as Deng and Gu arbitrarily issued telegrams, confusing the public. Moreover, Chen Jitang echoed, disrupting peace and hindering construction, speaking nonsense, not hesitating to damage his personality, forgetting the important responsibilities of the party and the country, and willingly being the second Chen Jiongming. Such acts of misleading the party and the country should not be done by the wise. If Chen and others are willing to wake up, it is not too late to rein in their horses. If they are obsessed, not only will they isolate themselves from the party and the country, but the day of their annihilation is not far away. Our association stands on the position of the National Revolution and is willing to lead the comrades in this district as the backing of the central government. This telegram is hereby sent for your consideration. Shanghai Special City Ninth District Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party.</p>

A telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan on the first day of this month, but no instructions were received. Now the end of May closing period is very near, and merchants in various industries in this city have repeatedly inquired, but they have no basis to answer. We hereby telegram again to ask for your consideration and expedite the telegram reply so that there is something to follow. Earnestly praying, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>

It has been reported that the office for issuing sand dredging permits, commissioned by the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, is levying sand and mud management fees, which are similar to disguised likin, in Jiangsu Province, causing a work stoppage. On May 20, we received a letter from the City Chamber of Commerce stating that the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province is levying sand and mud production and sales, which is a heavy burden on merchants, and requested that it be transferred and cancelled. We immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request that it be stopped. Now, we have received approval No. 12765 from the Ministry of Finance, stating that we have received the telegram and will consult the Zhejiang Provincial Government to investigate and cancel it. Please be informed. This approval, etc. Having received this, we will record and transfer the approval, hoping that you will investigate and comply. Also, Approval No. 12804 from the Ministry of Finance stated that we have received your report and have consulted the Zhejiang Provincial Government to request cancellation of the various sections stated. Please be informed. This approval, etc. Having received this, we immediately sent personnel to distribute notices to various places overnight, and all the operators in the industry were satisfied and resumed operations on the 21st. However, since this kind of exorbitant tax has been ordered to be cancelled by the ministry, it should be stopped from being collected. However, we have found that the office is still levying it, which is a disregard for political order and requires a request to stop it." Based on this, we hereby submit a document for your consideration, requesting that the collection of management fees similar to disguised likin be prohibited in order to maintain political order and ensure business stability. We hope that you will approve it for the public good.</p>
