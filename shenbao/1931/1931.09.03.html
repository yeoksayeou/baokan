<h3 id="c19">中國經濟學社當前之鉅責（一） <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>中國經濟學社自成立迄今。已有九年。其宗旨爲（一）提倡經濟學精深之研。究（二）討論現代經濟問題。（三）編譯各種經濟書籍。（四）贊助中國經濟界之發展及改進四項今年年會於本月一日在寗波舉行。并提出論文多種。此種具有學術價值之會社。雖其性質爲私人組設。但其對於我國經濟學前途。尤其對於我國經濟發展前途。都有絕大之關。係至足令吾人注意重視。</p>
<p>今日中國之經濟問。題千緒萬縷。極難分析把握。世界各國經濟學家對於中國經濟問題之研究。亦言人人殊。各有所是。各有所非。有謂中國目前仍停滯於封建社會經濟階段者。有謂中國已進入資本主義經濟之道途者。有謂中國舊有封建經濟一面破落。另一面又爲資本主義先進國家所桎梏。無法進入社會新階段。而仍不斷地腐朽崩潰。陷於極混亂衰落之慘境者。而於前途。則更見智見仁。推斷各異。中國之經濟問題。殆有如一謎。然而此一大謎之急待解答。則又爲我國家我民族目前最緊迫之要求。</p>
<p>中國經濟學社以討論現代經濟問題。贊助中國經濟之發展及改進爲己責。集全國經濟學界之鉅子。擔負深關我國家民族前途之重任。吾人認爲就研究學術立塲言。就解决關係我國家我民族前途之問題言。對於討論中國經濟上之基本問題。應先予吾人以一具體之答覆。</p>
<p>檢閱經濟學社出版之季刋社刋各種論文集演講集。及本年年會中之論文演講。對於吾人所急欲明瞭之根本問題。都未論及。所着重討論者。爲幣制問題。爲金銀問題。爲關稅及各種稅收問題。吾人誠不否認上述問題之極關重要。但在根本問題未得解答之先。則此種問題恰如不附幹之枝葉。漫無歸宿。而其討論之結果。亦將終歸於蹈空。無補於中國經濟之前途。</p>
<p>此次經濟學社之第九屆年會。恰在世界經濟蕭寥。資本主義經濟基礎呈現動摇。我國新遭奇重水刦。國家經濟國民生計倍感艱苦之情勢下舉行。則其意義更爲重大。而對於經濟上之根本問題。愈有切實加以研究。加以體認之必要。</p>
<p>吾人以爲研究中國經濟問。題應先從下列幾個根本問題着手。即</p>
<p>（一）世界資本主義之現狀及其前途。</p>
<p>（二）資本主義經濟之整個性。</p>
<p>（三）中國經濟在世界資本主義經濟中之地位及其關聯。</p>
<p>（四）中國經濟之變遷與現狀。</p>
<p>（五）中國經濟之特質。</p>
<p>（六）中國往何處去。</p>
<p>上列六問題。吾人認爲至關重要。此六問題如不得解答。則一切其他問題之討論。皆爲徒勞。吾人未見經濟學社對此種根本問題搜羅實際材料。致力研究。以其意見貢諸國人。以打破目前之艱難現狀。推中國社會步入應走之前途。但見胡適之先生在二卷一期經濟學季刋上。借口司馬遷爲資本主義作辯士。其或經濟學社諸君子尙未注意及此歟。</p>
<p>關於上述六問題。記者續貢所見。藉爲經濟學會諸君子萬一之助。</p>

<p>▲國民二日日内瓦電極可靠消息、法國已於昨日正式請國聨秘書廳展緩世界軍縮大會召集期、其動機蓋因法國將於明年五月舉行總選舉、美國將於明年十一月改選總統、且料英國不久亦將舉行總選舉、故提議將原定明年二月召集之軍縮大會無期展緩、但料美德俄匃四國將竭力反對、</p>

<p>▲國民一日日内瓦電歐洲關稅同盟、爲解决目前危局之最好及唯一辦法、歐洲委員會之股員今日於會議席上對此問題、有激烈之討論、瑞士代表史德基持反對論調、竭力攻擊、認全歐同盟爲不可能、法意代表主張亦同、認爲時機尙未成熟德代表浦斯則持贊成論、謂德國對此報告完全贊同、結果由該股向歐洲委員會建議、將此報告交各國政府及國聨各機關審查、儘年底將審查結果報告日内瓦</p>

<p>▲日軍在龍演習駐鮮日軍第十九師團、奉新任總督宇垣命令、調集會寗羅南工兵第十八十九兩聨隊、在慶源城川間會合駐軍、水陸聨兵、演習野戰、其陣地戰線、指定在我龍多島地帶、（日人改名柳多島·在慶源郡安農面·新開洞間·與我琿春縣界毘連）該島位於江心正流之北岸、確係我國領域、竟被日軍全部佔領、慶源軍原定八月四日準、備七日開始架橋演習及陸地野戰、至十三日止、甫經演畢、又奉師團電令加入城川水陸聨軍演習、行軍期改爲二十一日城川軍自七日準備、十五日開始至九月六日止將我龍多島嶼、圖門江面完全佔據不退、查龍多島係在慶源城川間之北部、乃在我圖門江正流之北岸、島嶼面積、計二方里許、在我琿春縣境内、又在我領水界中、確爲我國領土無疑、不料日人因我政府對於龍島、素不重視、亦未派員經營、故密謀侵佔、改名曰柳多島、暗中劃入日本版圖、且抱定狡詞抵賴主義、故我延吉市長兼交涉員張書翰、據琿春縣長崔龍藩報告、即向龍井村日總領事、提出嚴重抗議、</p>
<p>▲日領狡賴答覆延吉張交涉員向龍井村日總領事四次抗議、日總領事竟妄指柳多島（日人改稱）係屬朝鮮屬地、認爲日本版圖、並云前經江水汜濫、支流變爲正流、地方變遷、尙有舊跡可證、至第四次交涉時日總領允分電鮮總督及日政府、俟奉訓電、再定誰屬等語、八月二十四日午後一時、張交涉員據日總領覆牒、略稱案奉政府及鮮督電訓、查柳多島係在朝鮮北道慶源郡、安農面新開洞境内、確爲日本領士土、駐鮮會寗羅南慶源城川等郡之第十九師團、在日本領土士内、實行三週水陸行軍架橋演習、無關中國治安、華方方以不明該島所屬之故、迭提抗議、實屬誤解旣非中國領土、且無干涉權限、並不能撤軍中止演習、又據駐鮮軍司令部電稱、柳多島周圍不過二方里許、祗有鮮民十五戶、並無中國民戶居住、確與鮮境毘連、又與中國圖門江岸之領土接壤、雖云島接琿春境内、地屬朝鮮領土、與華領間隔距離稍遠屬地分明、中國無權干涉日本行軍、查明治二十九年八月、圖門江水暴漲、江流横汜、從華領東島下起、水向鮮境注流極大、當時水分兩股、中間形成島嶼、又當時幅員約二十間（一間合中國營造尺長五尺寛三尺）左右、嗣後江水又數次暴汜、幅員逐漸擴大、横流漫溢、無所制限、原有江身士岸、頓生變化、因之淹没無存、至大正八年、洪水又漲、地又變遷、圖門支流變爲正流、現在本流雖已乾涸、但有舊跡存在、尙可指認、由此證明柳多島確在鮮境、乃爲日本領土無疑、日軍在本國領土内、架橋演習、中國抗議、殊無理由、不但軍隊不能撤退且中國方面要求在該島設置警署、日側絕對堅拒、事出誤解、不成交涉問題等語、上述雖非覆牒原文、大致詞意不差、張據日領答覆後、以日軍侵我領水佔我領島確係預定陰謀、有組織、有計畫、存心抵賴、事非偶然、刻正準備最後抗議中、</p>
<p>▲我方抗議理由二十五日張交涉員電琿春崔縣長、速派專員往查勘報以憑根據交涉、崔奉電令後、當派外交科長黄子蘭、率警前往勘查、不料被日軍阻止而歸、張聞報頗憤慨、二十六日早十時許、親赴龍井村日總領館、面提第五次抗議、大致云、貴方覆牒已悉、所稱柳多島係屬日本領土一節、毫無根據證明查柳多島即是龍多島、圖門江正流、確爲我國所屬中日以江心分界、南爲鮮境、北屬中國、載在界約尙可覆按、前因江流水漲、此島早已沉没無存形跡消滅、但圖門江前經水患變遷、移向鮮境、嗣水消岸現、在江中正流北岸、隆起一大沙阜、四週各約二方里有奇、島現於江心正流之北、又位在俄屬江岔支流之中、當然島屬我中國領土、並有舊址指證、非鮮境日領域可知、惟沙阜隆起後、我官府命名龍多島、歷有二十餘年、人所共知、詎貴方不明屬界、亦名該島曰柳多島、以取音叶字異、俾作爭奪領土之謀、惟查該島面積及位置、完全與我領土相接、又在我琿春縣境内、並在江心正流迤北之中、由此各界證明、貴方不能以水後新陸隆起之沙島、而誤認爲柳多島、且爲日本領土所有、貴方此種誤解、有如間島、查間島本在鮮境、距延四五十里、日人命名延吉曰間島、汪清曰北間島、琿春曰東間島、和龍曰南間島、查間島至今尙在鮮境、何以搬到延琿四縣、柳多島已經水沉有年、今又何以遷至琿春、貴方誤解間島、亦猶以龍多島而爲柳多島、同一例耳、大錯特錯、未便鑄成、故暫口頭抗議、並面交抗議文書、其餘理由圖證請求保留、一俟查明、再爲正式送逹查照、雙方爭辯二小時許、日領仍狡詞抵賴、呶呶不休、午後二時、張始回延、晚電崔縣長搜集圖證、以作根據、並於是晚電呈吉林省府及外交部查照抗爭、以保領土主權、（八月二十八日）</p>

<p>北平僅獲二單打</p>
<p>（天津三十一日通訉）平津埠際網球賽、昨日繼續舉行、計單雙打共五組、三時開始、龍乾兄弟對薩氏兄弟之雙方首繼續舉行、結果薩氏敗北、以次舉行者、有薩本棟對鄭道璜之單打、林寳華吳少香對高惠民澤民兄弟之雙打、及横田對斐伯之單打、時昌黎昨因事未到、改由薩本鐵與大龍乾交鋒、五項比賽中、僅薩本棟之單打勝鄭道璜·餘勝利均歸津、總結果五比二、天津隊大勝、各隊交鋒、戰况均甚平平、較之慶應來津比賽時之火熾有霄壤之别、林吳對二高之雙打、本爲本届埠際賽之主力戰、林寳華昨晚即離津赴滬、昨爲在津最後之一戰、確甚賣力、吳少香亦有獨到處、惜對方之高澤民、太缺少經騐、手足慌亂、疲於應付、良機頻失雙方實力旣懸殊、自無精彩可言、茲將各項結果、分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c96">第二雙打 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>大龍乾六比三薩本鐵</p>
<p>（津）三比六（平）</p>
<p>二龍乾六比○薩本梀楝</p>
<p>前日二盤中、平津實力、似頗平準、薩氏兄弟穩練雖不足、輕快則有餘、乃昨日開戰未久、大龍乾抽球突見有力、正抽反抽、無不如意、薩氏兄弟幾失去抵抗能力、記錄板上、但見津方分數陸續上升而平則消息杳然、在第四五局上、曾有一度反攻、亦未能奏效、結果竟以二比一大敗、總結果爲二比一、自此以後、津方遂佔上風、</p>
<h3 id="c97">第二單打 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>六比四</p>
<p>陸本楝梀（平）鄭道璜（津）</p>
<p>六比四</p>
<p>薩本楝梀短小精悍、自前年回國後、在平網球界中已頗露頭角、鄭道璜則年歲尙幼、雖有時有極良之抽球壓球惟接球不穩、發球亦無把握、至良機屢失、薩本楝梀旣以六比四獲勝第一盤、第二盤復一氣呵成、連獲四局、鄭當此危急存亡之秋、頗能鎭靜自持、比數至四比三時、薩見時勢一縱即逝、亦奮力以保最後之勝利、相持移時、卒以六比四又獲勝、</p>
<h3 id="c98">第三雙打 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>林寳華六比二高惠民</p>
<p>（津）（平）</p>
<p>吳少香六比二高澤民</p>
<p>主力戰於四時開始、林寳華精神極振作、吳少香之壓球攔網、有顯著進步、高氏雙雄、咸身高六尺、身段敏活、爲天才的網球家、高澤民雖表演不甚佳抽球有獨到處、將來努力、實爲一極有</p>
<p>希望網球家、高惠民擊球似嫌太慢、跑亦不甚快、吃虧不少、結果兩局均以六比二失利、</p>
<h3 id="c99">第三單打 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>六比三</p>
<p>斐特（津）横田（平）</p>
<p>六比三</p>
<p>横田對斐特局、爲昨日最精彩之戰、兩將在各本隊、雖不佔重要地位、而表演咸極佳、且十分賢力、棋逢對手將遇良才、紀錄相互爭逐、動至難分難解、結果斐特佔勝、</p>
<h3 id="c100">第四單打 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>五比七</p>
<p>大龍乾（津）六比○薩本鐵（平）</p>
<p>六比○</p>
<p>大龍乾對薩本鐵之戰、最初雙方均平平、無甚精彩、第一局薩本鐵以七對五獲勝、第二局龍乾施出其生平抽球絕技、薩則漸不易應付、一敗再敗、竟至毫無抵抗、以六比○慘敗、第三盤薩陷於不振、大龍乾則來勢方猛、又以六比○大勝、於是轟轟烈烈之埠際賽、遂告閉幕、</p>

<p>兵車客車互撞</p>
<p>受傷各十餘人</p>
<p>車輛尙無大礙</p>
<p>滬杭路石湖蕩站、於昨晚七時半許、發生京杭特别快通車、與兵車互撞、乘客及士兵、各傷十餘人、即由救險車前　修理、交通可望無礙、該路長途電話線、適於事前七時許損壞、故詳情無從探悉、茲將互撞經過詳誌如次、</p>
<p>▲兵車出發　　　商星橋警衛軍二師四旅七團、奉命　防淞滬、即向路局索車三列、送往南　橋站候用、路局備妥後、即於昨日、分專車三列出發、第一列計掛車二十四輛、爲該團第一營所乘、上午十時出發至龍華、第二列爲第二營所乘、掛車二十六輛、十二時四十分出發、至北站、第三列掛車二十五輛、爲該團第三營全營所乘下午二時出發、將直駛吳淞下車駐防、</p>
<p>▲通車亦到當該第三列兵車、於昨晚七時半許、駛抵石湖蕩車站時、而由滬開杭之第三十二次京杭特别快通車亦同時到站、將在該站交車、</p>
<p>▲行車常例照該路行車常例、凡兩車同時到站交車、則先到之車可逕駛至月台、停妥後、再准另一列車進站、列車之可否進站、則以揚旗之倒否爲標準、</p>
<p>▲撞車情形昨晚七時半許、該第三列兵車、先行進站、照例第卅二次京杭通車頭、在外揚旗等候該兵車在月台停妥後、並見揚旗已倒後、方可駛進、詎昨晚第卅二次京杭通車、不待揚旗之倒、逕行駛進月台、同時駛入同條軌道之内、訇然一聲、遂致相撞、幸雙方速率均慢、未肇重大危險</p>
<p>▲機車受損　　　　　車於相撞後、其前有之鐵　　　　　即經各車之掛鈎、亦　　　　　　不重大、俟機車等之損壞、略加修理後、　可恢復原　、</p>
<p>▲救車出發上北站得訉後、即經數處之主管人員、會商之下、决由上北站開救　車、前往修理、俾仍可照常行駛、該救險車遂於十一時另五分、由北站出發、逕駛石湖蕩、</p>
<p>▲客兵受傷兩車互撞後、車中之乘客及士兵、各有十餘人受微傷、並無性命之虞、經醫生稍加包紥、即可出站、</p>

<p>▲難民防疫注射此次長江各埠發生大水災、漢蕪各埠災民來滬甚多、凡大</p>
<p>水之區、必有疫症發生、蓋水勢惡濁、易于釀疫也、海港檢疫處、已决定在漢口蕪湖等地、在災民下船來滬之際、由檢疫處實施注射疫針、在各船到滬時、且加檢騐、已定本月四號起實行、</p>
<p>▲日人救護僑商日本人在揚子江各埠甚夥、今年水災發生以後、滬上日人、組成同仁會之水災救護隊、已請本埠日清公司、派湘江丸輪、載該隊醫師十名事務員七人、看護十六名、雇員六人、共四十餘人、在滬辦定定藥品、開赴蕪漢長沙各地、救護日本人、</p>
<p>▲湘貨趕運出口歐美各國、在湘省採辦礦砂桐油、及宜昌沙市購辦芝蔴、出口者甚夥、向來該貨由湘運漢、再轉上海出口、近頃漢口各貨棧、已經淹没水中、各貨到漢、不能起陸、遂由湘帮客家、發電來滬、請將該項貨物、直接運滬出口、並請提前趕裝、故太古怡和已加派湖南班輪、運載湘中貨件來滬、在漢口不停、即轉江輪至申、滬上美商已先將所購礦砂裝出、日來頭批已到、正在報運出口云、</p>

<p>人類生孩子總歡喜孩子生得又白又胖。倘然生得瘦一點，黑一點父母或朋友們對於它便耍減少幾分寵愛。普通人大概多少有這樣一種心理。稍微懂得優生學一些皮毛的人甚至於根據身體的大小强弱武斷種子之優劣這是錯的。人不是一隻猪，何能以肥瘦定高下？中國普通孩子生下地大概是八九磅重，新近我們有兩位朋友生了一個孩子只有六磅重。我怕他們受了一般見解之影響，或者對於他們的小寳寳有所岐視，便寫了一封信，恭賀他們說：</p>
<p>（……聽說您們生了位六磅重的小寳寳我很歡喜。近二百五十年來領導自然科學之權威，牛頓Sir　lsaac　Newton生下地只有三磅重。您們的小寳寳是比牛頓加倍了，將來對於人類的貢獻也可比他多一倍。……）</p>
<p>牛頓生時，大家都以爲他活不成，派去請醫生的是兩位接生婆。伊們一面走一面埋怨說：（我們這樣拚命的趕，眞是太愚蠢了！他能活到我們回家，就算是奇蹟。這樣一隻小老鼠丨他總是不得活的，我們就把腿兒跑腫，也得不着一句感謝。姊姊丨我們吃這門飯，是没有法子喲。天老爺選着我們幹這件事，也只得趕吧。謝天謝地，吃容易走到了。）出乎接生婆意料之外，牛頓竟活了，而且活到八十五歲。（一六四二年生一七二七年死）</p>

<p>— 楊冶白</p>
<p>火傷因身體接觸火粉蒸汽𤍠湯及高𤍠之固體而起。日常遭遇之機會最多。其症狀分三級。第一級紅腫痛。第二級起水泡。第三級組織炭化缺損。治之之藥。不外具有滅菌消炎保護等性質之藥粉藥膏藥糊及石蠟劑等類。此皆般西醫所通用者。</p>
<p>一九二四年美人Daris在火傷組織之分泌液内。發現一種毒素。火傷之惡現象。胥由此毒素而起。此毒素遇單寗酸即凝結成痂。不復起毒作用。該氏乃用百分之五單寗酸水爲火傷之　敷料。獲得最優之治療成績。此後各地相繼仿行。均著確效。誠火傷療法之新進步也。</p>
<p>余曩在貴州鄕居。每亘百數十里。無西醫踪跡。鄕人受火傷後。輒嚼茶葉敷傷部。乾落再敷。終至結疤而愈。故老相傳。屢試屢騐。叩其故於中醫。則以敗火消毒之籠統語對蓋不知茶葉中含有單寗酸。敷茶之法。實與Dsris之理論吻合。惟嚼茶難免口齒中含有毒菌。不如用沸水泡濃茶浸於消毒棉花敷治爲愈。（普通棉花蒸或煑後可用）徒以吾人不知研究。知其然而不知其所以然。良可慨也。</p>
<p>吾國丹方治病。奏效者頗多。惜操之者多保守秘密。動以怪誕玄虚之語欺人。輾轉誤傳。日趨晦塞。倘能公開作精密之科學研究。或可產生許多醫學博士。對於世界醫壇。亦可有相當之貢獻矣。</p>

<p>伊不但是要維持自己個人的幸福，還很眞切的要保守着丈夫永久的愉快。伊們的婚姻，還成立了不久，雖然，並不是完全的自由戀愛而由於半新舊式父母之命媒妁之方所促成的，但是在結婚以前，伊們兩人都没有什麽不滿意；尤其是伊，的確是很濃摯的變愛丈夫。伊在初結婚的時候，伊有十分的滿足，伊覺得他是一個很誠實的青年，一些虚驕也没有，很勤懇地工作，不愛浮華，對於妻子，很温存。他的職業，是時常和女子们接近的，但是他除了職業必須接近者以外的時間，從來不曾瞞過妻子，或者是背了妻子，去和任何一個女子游散或談心。所以伊很信任他，格外的愛他。但是伊有時也些微的感覺到丈夫嫌拘謹，不是青年男子所應該有的態度。伊有許多女同學，都很活潑而美麗，伊常常請伊們到家裏來游玩，使他見面，隨便談話，或者出去郊游，或者是一同去看電影。伊感覺到丈夫的生活太單調了，想用這個方法，使丈夫的生活，不致這樣的枯燥。有時伊家事很心，便常常要伊的女友，陪伊的丈夫出去游玩，但是李先生十次至少有七八次是拒絕，偶然應允了，也很匆促的一個人回來了。伊更相信丈夫是除了妻子以外，是任何女子都不值得他的注意而發生同情的。</p>
<p>不幸啊！事情的變化，竟會這様的迅速，當然是出乎伊意料之外。平靜的湖而上，會來陣狂風吹起了很大的波濤。伊最親密的，只有陳夫人，所以託陳夫人向陳先生說，要陳先生偵探伊丈夫近來的行踪，秘寗地報告伊。陳人人當然應允盡力帮助伊，不使伊失望。</p>
<p>陳夫人的年齡比李夫人小三歲，但是伊的經騐與手腕，要比李夫人大上幾倍，所以伊對李先生現在的態度，是早已澈底瞭解，並且對於李夫人平時對待李先生的缺點，也很瞭解，但是伊不願把這些說給李夫人聽，雖然伊們是很親密的好朋友。伊覺得夫婦間的一切，任何外人都不能參加評判或從旁指摘是非，所以伊不曾勸陳先生盡力去帮李夫人的忙；反而警告陳先生不要去多管是非。</p>

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams 2</p>
<h3 id="e18">Chairman Chiang's Telegram Calls for Ending the Turmoil and Aiding Disaster Relief <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Chairman Chiang's telegram states: "Fellow countrymen across the nation, please be aware. It has been two months since Zhongzheng entered Jiangxi to suppress the Red bandits. Relying on the spirit of our late Premier in heaven and the loyalty and bravery of our soldiers, we were finally able to strike directly at the bandit nests and eliminate the Red atmosphere. Although the remnants have not yet been pacified and still need to be cleared, the fundamental solution is at hand. This is sufficient to comfort our fellow countrymen. Unfortunately, disaster has struck China. The Red atmosphere has subsided, but calamities are repeatedly occurring. Zhongzheng was ordered to inspect the disaster areas, from Jiangsu to Anhui, from Jiangxi to Hubei. For thousands of miles, floods overflowed, breached embankments, and inundated everything. Homes have been washed away, and people are dying in ditches. The people are lamenting like fish. The tragic situation is so extreme and cruel that it is unprecedented in human history. Alas, natural disasters and human calamities are shocking and heartbreaking. According to rough estimates, over 50 million of our innocent countrymen across the nation are awaiting death. Zhongzheng has traveled through the disaster areas, witnessing the tragic scenes of death, injury, and displacement, and the plight of those starving and awaiting food. My heart is filled with sorrow and anxiety. In addition, foreign aggression is coming one after another, and internal strife is frequent. The country is almost not a country, and the people cannot bear their fate. As one of the people responsible for the government, Zhongzheng is of meager virtue and ability and cannot prevent disasters from occurring in the first place. I am filled with remorse day and night and find it difficult to sleep. Although it is said that natural disasters are beyond human control, the lack of thorough planning and the failure to prevent disasters are things for which even if people do not blame me, can I not feel guilty before the gods? However, today's natural disasters and human calamities, along with internal and external troubles, are not ordinary events. They are a major crisis for our nation. As the saying goes, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation." Which of our fellow countrymen can fail to be cautious and vigilant, take responsibility, and work together to avert danger? We must exhaust our duty to save the nation and preserve our people. How can we allow continuous warfare and fratricide, and not stop until the country is destroyed and the people are exterminated? Zhongzheng is determined to uphold his principles and will never waver. In addition to suppressing the Red bandits and stabilizing society, I am determined not to allow war to break out again within our borders. This has already been declared repeatedly. Now, in addition to the bandit disaster, we are also suffering from floods. Our revolutionary goal is to save the nation, and the purpose of implementing our ideology is to save the people. Today, the people are truly trapped in deep water and fire, and are suffering an unprecedented catastrophe. All of our loyal revolutionary comrades are working together to save the nation and protect the people, and we still have worries that have yet to be addressed. How can we bear to see our suffering countrymen suffer further from the ravages of war and lose their lives? Therefore, although the rebellion in Guangdong and Guangxi has lasted for three months, I have endured and accommodated them and have not been willing to launch a single arrow or restart the war. This sincere heart can be sworn to heaven and earth. This is also something that all of my fellow countrymen can witness. Zhongzheng has survived hundreds of battles and, at this critical time of survival and extinction, only knows how to fulfill his responsibilities to make up for his faults. I will never cling to power and occupy a position without performing its duties. Furthermore, I dare not cling to my own opinions regarding the major plans of the party and the nation. If any of my comrades in the party have differing opinions or are dissatisfied with Zhongzheng personally, they can all speak frankly and openly, and strive for harmony and cooperation to achieve unity. If it is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and does not violate party discipline and national laws, then Zhongzheng will certainly withdraw and yield to someone more capable, even without resorting to force, in order to fulfill my lifelong aspirations. This is what Zhongzheng dares to solemnly declare to my fellow countrymen across the nation with utmost sincerity. I urgently hope that responsible comrades from all parties will share the difficulties of the times, not begrudge their advice, rise up and catch up, appeal for peace, so as to consolidate unity and complete the revolution. Zhongzheng only has one consistent aspiration: to devote all my strength to suppressing the Red bandits, regardless of anything else, hoping to remove the fundamental scourge of our nation and complete its sole mission, only hoping that internal and external troubles will disappear one after another, and that human and natural disasters will be gradually eliminated. Then, I will not hesitate to make any personal sacrifices. Alas, if the skin is gone, what can the hair adhere to? The national situation is precarious, and the people's livelihood is withering. If we are still deluded and seek to cause chaos, recklessly provoke conflict, and not hesitate to inflict suffering on the disaster victims and undermine the foundation of the nation, then directly preventing the suppression of the Red bandits is indirectly causing the flames of the bandits to rekindle. This is truly hastening our own destruction. I know that without an explicit order for suppression, those who violate public opinion, betray the revolution, and lose all conscience and integrity will eventually be abandoned by the people of the country. I hope that my fellow countrymen across the nation will be aware of this crisis of a hair's breadth, and be reminded of the last words of common struggle, be sure to put an end to civil war to save the disaster victims, and immediately summon auspiciousness and harmony to save China. Zhongzheng is not talented, but I swear to exhaust my duties and follow behind my fellow countrymen across the nation, in order to make up for the dangers of death and destruction in one out of ten thousand, so that I will be fortunate to avoid becoming a sinner of the party and the nation for all time. These humble sentiments are respectfully requested to be understood. Chiang Kai-shek, September 1st" (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Great Responsibility of the Chinese Economic Society at Present (1) <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Economic Society has been established for nine years. Its aims are: (1) to promote in-depth research in economics; (2) to discuss modern economic problems; (3) to compile and translate various economic books; and (4) to support the development and improvement of China's economic circles. This year's annual meeting was held in Ningbo on the first of this month, and many papers were presented. Although this kind of society with academic value is private, it is of great importance to the future of economics in our country, and especially to the future development of our country's economy. It is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Today, China's economic problems are numerous and difficult to analyze and grasp. Economists from various countries around the world also have different opinions on the study of China's economic problems, each with their own rights and wrongs. Some say that China is still stagnating in the economic stage of feudal society. Some say that China has entered the path of capitalist economy. Some say that China's old feudal economy is collapsing on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is being shackled by advanced capitalist countries. It cannot enter a new stage of society, but continues to decay and collapse, falling into a tragic state of extreme chaos and decline. As for the future, opinions vary. China's economic problems are almost like a riddle. However, the urgent need to answer this riddle is the most pressing requirement of our country and our nation at present.</p>
<p>The Chinese Economic Society takes it as its responsibility to discuss modern economic problems and support the development and improvement of China's economy. It gathers the giants of the economic circles in the country and shoulders the important task of deeply concerning the future of our country and nation. We believe that from the standpoint of academic research, in order to solve the problems related to the future of our country and nation, we should first give us a concrete answer to the basic problems of China's economy.</p>
<p>Reviewing the society's quarterly publications, journals, various collections of papers, collections of lectures, and the papers and lectures in this year's annual meeting, the fundamental problems that we urgently want to understand are not mentioned. What is emphasized is the monetary system, gold and silver, tariffs, and various tax issues. We certainly do not deny the extreme importance of the above-mentioned problems. But before the fundamental problems are answered, these problems are like branches and leaves that are not attached to the trunk, wandering without a home. The results of the discussion will ultimately be empty and will not help the future of China's economy.</p>
<p>The ninth annual meeting of the Economic Society this time happens to be held under the circumstances of the world economic recession, the foundation of the capitalist economy showing signs of shaking, our country suffering from unprecedented floods, and the national economy and people's livelihood feeling even more difficult. Its significance is even greater, and it is even more necessary to earnestly study and understand the fundamental problems of the economy.</p>
<p>We believe that the study of China's economic problems should start with the following fundamental problems. That is:</p>
<p>(1) The current situation and future of world capitalism.</p>
<p>(2) The integrity of the capitalist economy.</p>
<p>(3) China's economic position and relationship in the world capitalist economy.</p>
<p>(4) The changes and current situation of China's economy.</p>
<p>(5) The characteristics of China's economy.</p>
<p>(6) Where is China going?</p>
<p>We believe that the above six questions are crucial. If these six questions are not answered, then all other problems are discussed in vain. We have not seen the Economic Society collect actual materials on these fundamental problems and devote itself to research in order to contribute its opinions to the people of the country, so as to break the current difficult situation and push Chinese society into the future it should take. However, we see that Mr. Hu Shi, in Volume 2, Issue 1 of the Economic Quarterly, used Sima Qian's defense of capitalism as an excuse. Perhaps the gentlemen of the Economic Society have not yet paid attention to this?</p>
<p>Regarding the above six questions, the reporter will continue to contribute his views, hoping to be of some help to the gentlemen of the Economic Society.</p>

<p>Nanjing Yu Youren instructed the Supervisory Yuan that the disaster investigation commissioners sent should be mindful of the severity of the disaster and limit their itineraries to avoid wasting time. They should also reduce travel expenses to avoid wasting public funds. All welcome supplies, whether from organizations or individuals, should be rejected. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)</p>

<p>Nanjing The first step of the Huai River diversion project is to dredge the abandoned Yellow River waterway into the sea. It is planned to first dredge the river body from Qingjiangpu to Lianshui. Investigations show that the riverbed, which is more than 50 li from Qingjiangpu to Lianshui, is accumulated with sand and mud and is shallower than other places. After the dredging of this section, the water flow can be slightly smoother. Regarding the start-up expenses: (1) Approximately 500,000 yuan can be obtained from the Boxer Indemnity that is due this year. (2) It is planned to allocate and borrow several million from the disaster relief bonds. As of the end of the year, the accumulated material costs of the Boxer Indemnity are approximately 320,000 English pounds. It is currently planned to purchase materials with two-thirds of it.

<h3 id="e23">Ma Wenche is the Mastermind Behind the Gansu Coup <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Chen Guizhang and Lu Dachang Did Not Participate</p>
<p>Nanjing Ma Fuxiang telegraphed the Executive Yuan of the National Government Headquarters on the 1st, stating that, according to a telegram from Ningxia's Hu Tiankui, he had received a telegram from Lanzhou Commander Lei stating that he had received a central telegram relayed by Inspector Ma, ordering the dispatch of a team to keep Ma Hongbin under surveillance pending investigation. Upon receiving this, he followed the order and detained Ma Hongbin in the city today and reported to the central government to await investigation. He then replied to Commander Lei, saying that although the central government had issued an order, he should be treated with preferential treatment and that he should be allowed to resolve the situation in Gansu after the investigation. He asked if this matter was indeed a central order. Please inquire in detail for clarification. He also asked what the central government's plan for stabilizing the Gansu situation was, and whether Hongbin could immediately come to Ningxia. He asked for instructions as soon as possible. The material resources in Ningxia are often insufficient, and the bandit forces near the Hetao area are not pacified. Please give instructions. Hu Tiankui, Wei Hongfa, Ma Fushou, kowtowed. Also, Ma Hongkui's telegram stated that he had received a telegram from Ma Yulin stating that the entire Gansu coup was man-made by Ma Wenche. Among the committee members, Zhao Jingyu is a communist. Lei Zhongtian announced: (1) The chairman embezzled public funds; (2) He privately purchased guns and ammunition; (3) He deceived the central government; (4) He accommodated bandits. (5) Because the code was unclear, it was not translated. The Xining Radio Station has now been set up. He received a telegram from Ma Xunchen stating that Ma Wenche was ordered by the central government to detain the chairman and await investigation. Xunchen did not understand the truth and sent a telegram to inquire. Is there such an order from the central government? He also received telegrams from Chen Guizhang's representative Qin Zhongyue and Shui Zi from Xi'an stating that the news of the Lanzhou Incident was roughly the same as what they had heard here. It was purely Lei and Ma taking advantage of each other to create a disaster. Chen Guizhang did not participate, and even Lu Dachang heard that he did not join. How does the central government advocate for it recently? Please show us. Qin Zhongyue and Shui Zi kowtowed. Investigations show that Ma Wenche was the mastermind behind the Gansu coup. Hongbin has been benevolent and righteous, but unexpectedly, as an inspector, he has such illegal actions. Lei Zhongtian's accusations against Hongbin are all unfounded. In short, the government has its own proper handling methods for the actions of Lei Zhongtian, Ma Wenche, etc. Chen Guizhang and Lu Dachang did not participate in this coup, and it is conceivable that others were coerced. In addition to telegraphing to the various troops in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, they must not act rashly and listen to the central government's resolution. I beg your understanding. Ma Fuxiang kowtowed, Dong. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>Xuzhou Ma Hongkui sent Ma Rulong as his representative to Beijing to report the truth about the Gansu coup. Ma passed through Tai'an and Xuzhou on his way south on the evening of the 1st. It is said that Ma received a telegram from Ma Hongbin stating that the Gansu coup was by no means a Han-Hui conflict. It was Lei Zhongtian and the reactionaries who premeditated it. Ma plans to visit Ma Fuxiang and Chairman Chiang in Beijing to ask for a detailed investigation and handling of the Gansu situation. The key after this depends on Yang Hucheng's measures. It is best not to cause ethnic problems. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>Beiping A certain party received a joint telegram from Chen Guizhang, the first route garrison commander of Longdong, and Lu Dachang, the second route garrison commander of Longxi, declaring that they had not participated in the Gansu coup and that they had never heard of it beforehand. They did not agree to be listed as provincial committee members. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Han Fuqu Left Beiping Yesterday Morning to Go South <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Following his departure from the Shuncheng Wangfu residence in Beiping last night, Han Fuqu spent the entire night discussing matters at his residence with Wan Fulin, Ji Yiqiao, Yu Xuezhong, Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, and others. This morning at 7:00 AM, Han, along with his wife Ji Ganqing, Jiang Bocheng, Zhang Shaotang, and others, left Beiping to return to Jinan. Ji Yiqiao, Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezhong, Tang Guozhen, and others all went to the station to see him off. Upon arriving in Jinan and assuming the post of Commissioner of Qingxiang for Shandong and Henan, Han will immediately go to Bian to meet with Liu Zhi to discuss the Qingxiang plan.

Upon arriving in Jinan, he would briefly arrange matters related to the provincial government, and in three or four days, he would go to Bian to meet with Chairman Liu.

According to Han, he received generous treatment during his many days in Beiping. He discussed two matters with Deputy Commander Zhang, and the results were excellent. One was the issue of public security in North China, which Deputy Commander Zhang generously took charge of. The other was the matter of urging Yan Xishan to leave Shanxi, for which there were also concrete measures. Because Yan's presence in Shanxi caused unrest and affected the political situation in both the north and the south, Xu Yongchang was sent first, followed by someone dispatched by Deputy Commander Zhang. The final solution, hopefully, will not need to be implemented. He himself will soon go to Henan to assume the post of Commissioner of Qingxiang for Shandong and Henan. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>At 6:30 PM, Han's train arrived in Dezhou, where he summoned Zhao Xinde, commander of the 3rd Regiment, and Xie Shixin's artillery unit to give a speech. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

Commercial vessels passing through the area have also been repeatedly harassed. Chen Shaokuan telegraphed the Minquan warship in Yuezhou, ordering it to patrol Bailuoji. Yesterday, upon reaching the vicinity of Yanglinji, gunshots suddenly erupted. The warship responded with heavy machine-gun fire on the concentrated areas of the bandits. The bandits used fire as a signal to gather their forces and resist relying on the terrain. The warship's artillery was too powerful, and the bandits fled into the deep forest. As it was already dusk, they did not pursue them. They will conduct another operation today. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>International Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>France Proposes Postponement of Summoning</p>
<p>Customs Union Issue</p>
<p>European League Members Had Fierce Debate</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 1st - The 64th session of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting opened this morning, chaired by Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux. The British delegation is led by Cecil. The agenda includes the German-Austrian customs issue and the Iraqi independence issue. The latter issue was raised by the administering country, Britain. This is the preliminary step to allow Iraq to join the League of Nations. France has a similar suggestion for Syria.</p>
<p>▲National, Geneva, 2nd - According to highly reliable sources, France formally requested the League of Nations Secretariat yesterday to postpone the convening of the World Disarmament Conference. The motive is that France will hold general elections next May, and the United States will hold presidential elections next November. It is also expected that Britain will hold general elections soon. Therefore, it is proposed to postpone the disarmament conference, which was originally scheduled to be held next February, indefinitely. However, it is expected that the United States, Germany, Russia, and Italy will strongly oppose it.</p>
<p>▲National, Geneva, 1st - According to reliable sources, most of the internal representatives of the League of Nations Council have decided not to discuss the issue of the chairmanship of next year's disarmament conference for the time being. Only when Henderson voluntarily resigns or Britain reorganizes a Conservative Party cabinet will a replacement be elected. However, the French side is plotting to remove Henderson and elect Czech Foreign Minister Benes as chairman.</p>
<p>▲National, Geneva, 1st - As the League of Nations Administrative Council is about to conclude its 64th session, news was received here today that France has sent a new memorandum to the Italian government regarding naval issues. The most entangled issue on the European political stage, the German-Austrian customs union, has also been agreed to be temporarily shelved by Germany and Austria. It is expected that it can be formally announced before the Hague Court issues its ruling. The Hague Court's ruling is expected to be released on Saturday. However, Germany's accusation against Poland regarding the treatment of German minorities in Upper Silesia is still pending the Council's consideration.</p>
<p>▲National, Geneva, 1st - A European customs union is the best and only way to resolve the current crisis. Members of the European Commission had a heated discussion on this issue at today's meeting. Swiss representative Stucki opposed it, strongly attacking it and believing that a pan-European alliance was impossible. The French and Italian representatives also held the same view, believing that the time was not yet ripe. German representative Puss supported it, saying that Germany fully agreed with the report. As a result, the group suggested to the European Commission that the report be submitted to the governments of various countries and the various agencies of the League of Nations for review and report the results of the review to Geneva by the end of the year.</p>

As for the implementation details, Finance Minister Snowden will announce them later. Conservative Party leader Baldwin sent a letter to Conservative Party members of the House of Commons, asking them to assist the current government during the upcoming assembly period, saying that this is the most critical period in British history. If we cannot fulfill our duties to overcome this crisis, it will be a disgrace to our party and will harm the country.</p>
<p>▲National, London, 1st - Government officials announced today that the newly organized national government will focus on financial affairs, and will only handle ordinary events for international issues. Major issues such as war debts and reparations will be left to the succeeding cabinet to deal with. Today's cabinet meeting of three hours completed the austerity plan, and the revenue plan is expected to be considered by Wednesday or Thursday. The cabinet members of the three parties are very cooperative, and the Labor Party's attacks on MacDonald have also slightly weakened. According to reliable sources, several Labor Party members have sent letters to MacDonald declaring their continued support.</p>

<p>Telegram from Zhenjiang to Shen Bao for your information: We have just received reports from various counties that Xinghua and Dongtai are entirely submerged, Yancheng is completely underwater, and the water in Taixian is approaching the city walls. Disaster victims are gathering in Taicheng. There are more than ten breaches in the canal dikes, and the water continues to flow downwards. The government is under the mistaken impression that the water in You and Shao has receded. They do not realize that the receding water upstream means the land downstream is being submerged. We are crying out until our voices are hoarse, wanting to cry but without tears. Therefore, we again urge all parties to unanimously advocate and awaken the authorities to quickly block the breaches and, at the same time, raise funds for relief and rescue lives together. Urgent, urgent. Disaster Relief Association of Yancheng, Fuyu, Taidong, and Xinghua stationed in Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Appeal for Relief from the Hubei Huangmei County Flood Relief Association to the Chief Editor of Shen Bao and all charitable organizations, including the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, Jisheng Association, and Red Cross Society: Since the beginning of summer, we have experienced continuous rainfall for months. The Yangtze River has risen dramatically, reaching a level unseen in a century. Vast expanses of water stretch for miles. Embankments have collapsed, fields and homes are submerged, and people and livestock have been swept away. The number of deaths is incalculable. Recently, we were hit by three more typhoons, causing thousands of houses to collapse and drowning over a thousand people. Corpses float on the water everywhere. Some couples embrace each other, mothers and children hold on to each other, and entire families of five or six tie themselves together with ropes to die. The scene is appalling. Currently, the disaster victims who have survived are gathered on roadsides, living in the open air, sitting on the mud, and suffering from hunger. The old and the young cry together, and the fields are filled with the sounds of wailing, awaiting death. It breaks the heart of anyone who sees it. We, the association, witnessing this catastrophe and the difficult times, besides sending telegrams to the Hubei Provincial Government and the Flood Relief Association to quickly allocate urgent relief funds to save the dying victims, also appeal to all charitable organizations, benevolent people, and gentlemen to have a heart of compassion and provide assistance to share the benefits and make great contributions by fundraising and donating. We sincerely await orders and hope for your compassion. Hubei Huangmei County Flood Relief Committee Yang Xietang Four Towns Branch gratefully.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Japanese Troops Occupy Longdu Island <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Forcefully Claiming Longdu Island as Liuduo Island</p>
<p>Conducting Military Exercises at Will and Refusing to Withdraw</p>
<p>Our Side's Five Protests Have Been Ineffective</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The 19th Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Korea dispatched two battalions of engineers from Huining and Luonan, concentrated between Qingyuan and Chengchuan, and conducted joint army and navy exercises for three weeks along the Tumen River and its left bank, including bridge construction. They also invaded our territory of Longdu Island and our territorial waters of the Tumen River. Our protests have been ineffective. Detailed information from the investigation is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Japanese Army Conducting Exercises in Longdu: The 19th Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Korea, under the orders of the new Governor-General Ugaki, mobilized the 18th and 19th engineer regiments from Huining and Luonan and held joint army and navy field exercises between Qingyuan and Chengchuan. The battlefield area was designated in the Longdu Island area (renamed Liuduo Island by the Japanese, located between Xin Kai Dong, An Nong Township, Qingyuan County, and bordering our Hunchun County). The island is located on the north bank of the main current in the center of the river and is definitely our country's territory. It was completely occupied by the Japanese army. The Qingyuan army originally planned to prepare on August 4th and begin bridge construction exercises and land field exercises on the 7th, ending on the 13th. However, they received an order from the division to join the joint army and navy exercises in Chengchuan, and the exercise period was changed to August 21st. From August 7th, the Chengchuan army prepared and began to occupy our Longdu Island and the Tumen River completely until September 6th without withdrawing. Longdu Island is located in the northern part of Qingyuan and Chengchuan, on the north bank of the main current of our Tumen River. The island area is about two square li, within our Hunchun County and within our territorial waters. It is undoubtedly our country's territory. Unexpectedly, the Japanese, because our government has never paid attention to Long Island and has not sent personnel to manage it, secretly plotted to invade and occupy it, renaming it Liuduo Island and secretly incorporating it into the Japanese territory. They are determined to use cunning words and deny their actions. Therefore, Zhang Shuhan, the mayor of Yanji and concurrently negotiator, based on the report from Cui Longfan, the magistrate of Hunchun County, lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Consul-General in Longjingcun.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Consul's Cunning Reply: Zhang Shuhan, the Yanji negotiator, protested four times to the Japanese Consul-General in Longjingcun. The Japanese Consul-General recklessly claimed that Liuduo Island (renamed by the Japanese) belonged to Korean territory and was part of Japan. He claimed that the river had previously flooded, and the tributary had become the main stream. Although the area had changed, old traces could still be found to prove this. During the fourth negotiation, the Japanese Consul-General agreed to telegraph the Governor-General of Korea and the Japanese government and wait for instructions to determine ownership. On August 24th, at 1:00 PM, Zhang Shuhan received a reply from the Japanese Consul-General stating that, based on instructions from the government and the Governor-General of Korea, Liuduo Island was located within Xinkai Dong, An Nong Township, Qingyuan County, North Province of Korea, and was definitely Japanese territory. The 19th Division stationed in Huining, Luonan, Qingyuan, and Chengchuan counties in Korea was conducting three weeks of joint army and navy exercises and bridge construction within Japanese territory, which had nothing to do with Chinese security. China repeatedly protested because it was unclear about the ownership of the island, which was a misunderstanding. Since it was not Chinese territory, there was no right to interfere, and the troops could not be withdrawn or the exercises stopped. According to a telegram from the Korean Military Headquarters, Liuduo Island was only about two square li in size, with only 15 Korean households and no Chinese residents. It bordered Korean territory and also bordered the Chinese bank of the Tumen River. Although the island was adjacent to Hunchun, the land belonged to Korean territory, and the distance between the Chinese territory was slightly longer. The territory was clearly divided, and China had no right to interfere with Japanese military exercises. In August of the 29th year of the Meiji era, the Tumen River flooded, and the river flowed extensively, flowing from Dongdao in Chinese territory towards the Korean territory. At that time, the water divided into two streams, forming an island in the middle. At that time, the area was about 20 jian (one jian is equivalent to 5 Chinese construction feet in length and 3 feet in width). Later, the river flooded several times, and the area gradually expanded, overflowing without restriction. The original riverbanks and shores changed drastically, resulting in their submergence. In the 8th year of the Taisho era, the flood rose again, and the land changed again. The tributary of the Tumen River became the main stream. Although the current main stream has dried up, old traces still exist and can be identified. This proves that Liuduo Island is indeed in Korean territory and is undoubtedly Japanese territory. The Japanese army's bridge construction exercises within its own territory should not be protested by China. Not only can the troops not be withdrawn, but the Japanese side absolutely refuses China's request to set up a police station on the island. The matter is a misunderstanding and cannot be negotiated. Although the above is not the original reply, the general meaning is accurate. After Zhang received the Japanese Consul's reply, he believed that the Japanese army's invasion of our territorial waters and occupation of our island was a premeditated conspiracy, organized, planned, and intended to deny the facts. It was not accidental. He is currently preparing the final protest.</p>
<p>▲Reasons for Our Protest: On the 25th, Zhang Shuhan telegraphed Cui Longfan, the magistrate of Hunchun, instructing him to quickly dispatch a commissioner to investigate and report the details to serve as the basis for negotiations. After receiving the telegram, Cui sent Huang Zilan, the head of the foreign affairs section, to investigate, but he was stopped by the Japanese army and returned. Zhang was quite indignant upon hearing the report. At about 10:00 AM on the 26th, he personally went to the Japanese Consulate-General in Longjingcun and raised the fifth protest, roughly stating: Your reply has been received. The claim that Liuduo Island belongs to Japanese territory is unfounded. Longdu Island is the same as Liuduo Island, and the main current of the Tumen River is definitely within our country. China and Japan use the center of the river as the boundary, with the south belonging to Korea and the north belonging to China. This is recorded in the border treaty and can be verified. Previously, due to the river flood, this island had long been submerged and disappeared. However, the Tumen River changed course due to flooding, shifting towards Korean territory. Later, the water receded, and a large sandbar rose in the main current of the river on the north bank, about two square li in size. The island is now located on the north bank of the main current in the center of the river and is also located in the tributary of the Russian Jiangcha. Of course, the island belongs to our Chinese territory, and there are old sites to prove that it is not Korean territory or Japanese territory. It is known that after the sandbar rose, our government named it Longdu Island, which has been for more than 20 years and is known to everyone. How could you not know the boundary and also name the island Liuduo Island, using similar sounds and different characters, in order to plot to seize territory. The area and location of the island are completely connected to our territory and are located in our Hunchun County, north of the main current in the center of the river. All parties can testify that you cannot mistakenly recognize the newly risen sand island after the flood as Liuduo Island and claim it as Japanese territory. This kind of misunderstanding is like the case of Jiandao. Jiandao is originally in Korean territory, forty or fifty li from Yanji. The Japanese named Yanji Jiandao, Wangqing Beijiandao, Hunchun Dongjiandao, and Helong Nanjiandao. Jiandao is still in Korean territory today. How can it be moved to the four counties of Yan, Xun, and Hunchun? Liuduo Island has been submerged for many years. How can it be moved to Hunchun now? Your misunderstanding of Jiandao is the same as your misunderstanding of Longdu Island as Liuduo Island. It is the same example, a big mistake that cannot be allowed to happen. Therefore, I am protesting orally for the time being and submitting a written protest. Other reasons and evidence are requested to be reserved. Once the investigation is completed, I will formally submit it for your review. The two sides argued for about two hours. The Japanese Consul still denied the facts with cunning words and kept talking endlessly. At 2:00 PM, Zhang returned to Yanji and telegraphed Magistrate Cui to collect maps and evidence as a basis. On the evening of the same day, he telegraphed the Jilin Provincial Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate and protest in order to protect the sovereignty of the territory.

<p>The Provincial Government Decides to Allocate 100,000 Yuan for Rescue Expenses</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: Regarding the Jiangnan Seawall, on the evening of the 26th, the Department of Construction received a telegram from Director Xue Zhaoshu of the seawall, stating that a violent wind and giant tide had destroyed more than a thousand zhang of the Bao Seawall, with dozens of breaches. In addition to the urgent blocking efforts, he requested to quickly bring funds for an on-site survey. The Water Conservancy Bureau, aware of the dangers to the dikes in Wuhan and Haining, Zhejiang, and because the autumn flood season had arrived, fearing unexpected events on the Jiangnan Seawall, advanced 5,000 yuan to the institute for emergency needs. Later, when a dangerous situation occurred, Director Mao led engineers with funds to conduct an on-site survey. After arriving, they reported in several telegrams that more than a thousand zhang of the Baoshan Seawall had been damaged, including more than 400 zhang of dangerous seawall, more than 40 zhang of gaps, and more than 30 zhang of breaches. Additionally, more than 290 zhang of iron-reinforced concrete stone slope at Beishidong and other places were completely destroyed. Thousands of piles along the seawall were broken. Efforts are being made to block the breaches, and more than 100,000 yuan is expected to be needed. The breach at Xuejiatan is the most dangerous. Materials are being prepared day and night to block it. More than 500 zhang of the Taicang Seawall were damaged, with 50 zhang of gaps and 40 zhang of breaches. The northern and southern ends of the cement wall section of the Daotang Temple were destroyed, and the body of the seawall in the northern section was completely collapsed and level with the ground, which is the most dangerous. All of the rescue projects carried out last month, except for the wooden piles, were also destroyed. Efforts are being made to block all the breaches, and the estimated cost is 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. In addition to the 30,000 yuan already advanced by the Department of Construction, the Water Conservancy Bureau was also ordered to send additional engineers, and the magistrates of Taicang and Baoshan were telegraphed to hire laborers. The directors of the construction bureaus of the two counties, along with technicians, went to assist. A proposal was submitted to the Provincial Government meeting to quickly allocate 100,000 yuan from the provincial treasury for important projects, which was approved by yesterday's Provincial Committee meeting. Several places in the Songjiang Seawall were also damaged, and the Department is sending personnel to investigate.</p>

Those who traveled with him included Wu Tongju, the director of the Grand Canal Engineering Office, Cheng Yiqing, a standing member of the Relief Association, and Chen Zhao, the magistrate of Jiangdu County. At 11:00 AM, the ship arrived at Shaobo, and he immediately disembarked to inspect the dike for a week. Then he returned to the ship and sailed upstream. Li Mingyang, the director of the Provincial Security Office, heard that Ye and others were heading north, so he immediately invited Wang Shuxiang, who was experienced in managing the canal (Wang was a former counselor of the Grand Canal Engineering Office), to take the Gao special ship south. He met Ye at Lujin. Li and Wang Shuxiang boarded the ship to pay their respects, and they discussed the restoration of the river dike and all measures to prevent the collapse of other banks on the ship. At 7:00 PM, the ship docked at the dike on the north gate of Gaoyou, which was in a vast expanse of water. He stayed overnight. The next morning, he traveled north from You. It is said that this inspection will end at Qingjiangpu. After Zhang Zhijiang, the supervisor, learned of the Grand Canal breach, he returned to Yangzhou from Beijing a few days ago. In addition to purchasing dry food and sending personnel to the disaster areas to rescue more than a thousand disaster victims, on August 31st, he and Secretary-General Sun Yucheng, Adjutant Song Bangrong, Counselor Wang Chunru, and more than 60 guards rented a small steamer from the Tiantai Merchant Shipping Bureau, two tugboats, a civilian boat, and two other boats, loaded with more than 500 bags of dry food, and headed to the Shaogao area to rescue the disaster victims. At 8:20 AM, the ship arrived at Shaobo. He saw that fewer houses had collapsed in the south of the street, the loss in the middle city was heavier, and the entire north city had disintegrated. The water in the street was the same as the river. According to statistics, more than half of the houses in the town had collapsed. There were a total of 21 breaches, large and small, of which 9 had been blocked. In addition to distributing some of the dry food, Zhang also instructed the troops stationed in the town to work hard to help repair and rob. At 9:10 AM, he left Shao and headed north. Because the water in the Grand Canal was unusually turbulent, fearing that it would enter the breach, he slowly advanced northeast along the lake. Along the way, except for occasionally seeing the treetops slightly exposed to the water, knowing that it was land, everything else was a vast expanse of water. At 2:00 PM, he arrived in Gaoyou and ascended the city from the city wall that had been excavated. The inside of the city was like a crystal palace. All the disaster victims were sitting on the top of the city wall, living in thatched sheds. The sad and tragic scene cannot be described in words. The magistrate of the county, Wang Long, cried bitterly when he saw Zhang, and Zhang also shed tears. At the moment, the county government is temporarily moved to the Guandi Temple outside the South Gate (the entire city has a higher terrain in the South Gate and less water). The Public Security Bureau is located in a tea house, and the Finance Bureau has no funds to collect. Education and construction have been suspended long ago. Zhang distributed all the dry food he brought. He spent the night on the boat in Gaoyou and discussed with Chairman Ye the two key points of short-term and long-term solutions. The short-term solution is to block the breach, and the long-term solution is to consolidate the river dike. At dawn on the first day, after Ye Qiding headed north, Zhang drummed the wheels and returned south. (September 2nd)</p>

<p>Eight Counties Including Jiangtai Petition for Urgent Blocking of Breaches</p>
<p>Yangzhou Dispatch: The disaster victims and relief efforts in Shao and You have been detailed in previous reports. It is now known that in Taixian, after the Shaobo dike breached, the east, west, and north townships were all submerged. Except for the South Gate, the rest of the city became a swamp. The special commissioner of the county party headquarters took a Jiang steamer to Yangzhou on the first day to report the disaster and arrange relief work. Chairman Ye, who went north to survey the disaster on August 31st, arrived here at noon on the first day, docked outside Fuyun Gate, entered the city to discuss official business, and returned to the original boat to return to the province. All the refugees who have been rescued, in addition to the Jiangdu Emergency Relief Association, the Red Swastika Society, and the Supervisor's Office, have been transported to Yangzhou in turn, handed over to the reception center, or escorted across the river. On the first day, Xu Guocun, the leader of the second team of the Jiangbei Disaster Relief and Relief Association of Zhenjiang, transported more than 400 refugees from the Shaoyou area, leaving more than 200 people and sending them to the Changsheng Temple reception center, and sending the rest to the Zhenjiang reception center. Jing Mingming, Xu Baoheng, and Wu Jinren of Hejia Lane, South Gate, went to distribute relief, 300 articles per person, and then went to the Putuo Temple reception center (which originally had 47 refugees) to distribute the same amount. The relief goods received by the Emergency Relief Association today (the first day), in addition to sporadic dry food and relief money, the largest was Wang Bailing's aid of 1,000 foreign yuan and the philanthropist Wei Cufan's 200,000 articles. In addition to sending personnel to transport a large amount of dry food to various disaster areas for distribution, the association also hired 70 officials, gentry, wealthy merchants, and financiers from the Jiangdu Chamber of Commerce, together with the chambers of commerce of Taigao, Xingbao, Yanfu, and other eight counties, to present a joint petition to the National Government and the Provincial Government's Huai River Guidance Committee, stating that disaster relief and blocking the breaches should be equally emphasized, and planned six measures for execution. In addition, Fang Yaoxi and others from Jiangzhou have been sent to the city to report the disaster and ask for relief, roughly saying that there are more than 10,000 refugees waiting for relief urgently, and if they are delayed, they will freeze to death. As for the water situation, the water level of the canal outside the city fell slightly yesterday, but this afternoon the east wind was strong again, and the tide was supporting it, and it increased by a foot again. The dikes and weirs of the various islands near the river, which were spared before, are in imminent danger again. All the floating corpses in the river have been transported in coffins by the emergency relief association and the Red Swastika Society, and handed over to those responsible for collecting the corpses for collection and burial. However, it is a pity that there are many corpses and few coffins, and omissions are still unavoidable. (September 1st)</p>

<p>More Than a Thousand Floating Corpses in Wuhu Cannot Be Buried</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The flood disaster in Anhui Province is so severe that it is unprecedented in nearly a century. Unexpectedly, a hurricane struck again the day before yesterday, and more than a thousand refugees were swept into the flood by the wind and waves. Other losses are even more unspeakable. At the moment, the corpses are scattered and drifting downstream, accumulating on Xiliang Mountain, reaching more than 600 bodies. Those that have not drifted away are mostly connected in series with ropes and tied to large trees, such as Xingchun and Shouchun dikes, which are everywhere. Although charitable organizations have prepared many coffins for burial, there is also a sigh of too many corpses and too few coffins. Now, in addition to carrying a large amount of steamed buns and distributing them every day, emergency relief agencies have also set up clinics to prevent epidemics. Qian Danwu, a member of the Central Disaster Inspection Committee, and Wen Yi, a member of the Provincial Department of Construction, came to Wuhu from the province yesterday and went to the county government to discuss the joint disaster inspection method with Magistrate Yu. That night, the Flood Relief Association and the Wufan Five Counties Relief Association negotiated with Qian to hire a special ship at 8:00 AM this morning (the 31st) to conduct an on-site inspection of the disaster areas such as Mapu, Bajiaodian, and Fenglinwei along the West River. It is planned to rush back tonight and collect disaster area photos, investigation forms, and solicit opinions from all parties on water conservancy dredging and other matters tomorrow (the 1st) in Wuhu. On the 2nd, they will go to Fanchang, Nanling, Xuancheng, and other counties, and return to Wuhu around September 17th, and then go to Dangtu for inspection. It is expected to return to Beijing on the 19th and transfer to Guoyang, Lingbi, and Mengcheng to inspect the disaster situation. As for Zhuang Yan, the commissioner sent by the central government with 170,000 yuan for relief, he needs to wait for the completion of the five-member disaster investigation group before he can allocate the relief money according to the severity of the disaster. The Wufan Five Counties Relief Association previously sent Zhai Zhancheng as a representative to Beijing and Shanghai to raise relief funds. Although they have raised 40,000 yuan in relief funds and 2,000 bags of flour, they cannot be transported to Wuhu for a while, which is a concern that distant water cannot put out a nearby fire. Therefore, the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce issued a circular today, calling for urgent relief. The water level has been rising steadily for days, and people are becoming more panicked. The customs water level has reached more than three zhang and eight inches! (August 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Yellow River Water Level is No Longer a Concern <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Water Level is Equal to the Pre-Flood Level</p>
<p>But There Are Small Waves in the Liugong Section Upstream</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Yellow River water level has been decreasing day by day, and the water from Shaanxi Province upstream has gradually reached Shandong Province. The water level is stable, and there is no danger. This morning (the 31st), the River Affairs Bureau received a water report from Shaanxi, stating that the river water has dropped by eight inches and six points compared to three days ago. According to the Luokou water report, the river water has dropped by six inches today, and the water level is eight zhang seven chi and three cun. Based on the current water level, it is equal to the water level before the flood. Only the Liugong section (Liuyuan) in the upstream section has small waves due to the narrower riverbed. Each dam is inevitably damaged by the rushing torrents. The River Affairs Bureau received an urgent telegram from Liugong at 2:30 PM today (the 31st), which said: The water rose nine inches this morning, and the current is retreating, hitting dams 14, 15, 16, and 17. A section of the newly made sweep dam at the 16th dam is isolated and helpless, and the upper corner has been steeply eroded by three chi. The two dams at the 17th dam are low above the water. Although a section of the cross-ear dam has been added to the upper end of the No. 1 sweep dam, the waves are surging and extremely turbulent, and it is feared that it will be difficult to resist. Furthermore, there is a shortage of materials, which is very difficult. In addition to urging Magistrate Li of Pu County to send police to the countryside to rush and urge the transportation of straw materials to meet the urgent needs, I hereby report to you. Xu Desheng, Section Chief, kowtows. (August 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Record of Inspection of the Flood Disaster at Weishan Lake in Xuzhou <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The North of Xuzhou City Has Been Submerged</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Weishan Lake in the north of Xuzhou is connected to Nanyang Lake in southern Shandong. It collects water from the Grand Canal and has dams for storage and discharge. The water discharged from the south bank flows south through Lanjia Mountain to Wanzhai, twelve li north of Xuzhou City, then turns east into the Jing River, which is the largest construction in Xuzhou, the Jing Mountain Bridge. This summer, there was heavy rain in Xuzhou, and the water in the old course of the Yellow River rose sharply. However, Weishan Lake has not yet overflowed, as the water from the old course of the Yellow River and the water discharged from the south of Weishan Lake are not connected at all. Recently, the water danger in Xuzhou City has passed, but heavy rains in southern Shandong caused mountain floods to break out, and the water in Nanyang Lake overflowed and flooded the south. At the same time, the water in Weishan Lake rose sharply, and the villages along the lake became a watery realm. Local authorities reported the disaster to the county government one after another. The Water Disaster Relief Association, considering that the water discharged from the south of Weishan Lake was very close to the city, specially sent Hu Yunqing from the Agricultural Rehabilitation Committee, Wang Yongfu from the Construction Bureau, and Li Yuhai from the Red Cross Society to inspect on August 29. That morning, they departed from Xuzhou City by rickshaw, passing through Pingyamenkou, Xiaogushan, Shitun, Tanggou, and Taoyuan. The low-lying areas along the way were all flooded, and there was no hope for the autumn harvest. In the afternoon, they arrived at Zhengji, forty li north of Xuzhou, which is very close to the lake. The area north of the market town, being low-lying, was already submerged, and the disaster was severe. On the morning of the 30th, they traveled fifteen li east from Zhengji to Wanglou by the lake, and then changed to a boat to sail southeast along Liuzhuang, Dingji, Taikeng, Wangtang, Ronggou, Sunzhuang, Donglou, Qianhou Gaotan, Daxiao Yanzhuang, Xia Zhoulou, Qinlou, Wafang, and other places. It was a vast expanse of water, with only the ridges and eaves of houses exposed, spanning more than twenty li in width and length. The number of people who died in the water must be countless. The boat landed at Weizhuang and turned to Dachacheng along the Xinyan. Dachacheng was the ancient state of Chonghouhu, and the terrain was relatively high. The overflowing water of Weishan Lake had reached the Grandma Temple north of Dachacheng, and Dachacheng was only thirty li away from the city. Traveling southeast from Dachacheng to Wanzhai River, the river connected to Weishan Lake, and the water had already reached the shore. About two li from Wanzhai, there was the Checun Kou Dam, which was the first embankment to protect the city from flooding. Unfortunately, it had fallen into disrepair and was breached in many places. The water nearby had already submerged the shins. Then, they returned to Xuzhou City from Machang Lake, and it was already dusk. It was found that the first line of defense in Xuzhou against the water of Weishan Lake was the Checun Kou Dam, and the second was the levee north of Bazijie. Since the Checun Kou Dam had fallen into disrepair, the water flowed from there into Machang Lake north of Bazijie, and the rice fields were about to be completely flooded. Fortunately, the levee north of Bazijie prevented this, so the city was still not in danger, but the villages north of the city were already in a dire situation. According to statistics, the lake water rose south, overflowing the original bank by fifteen li, rising southeast to Dachacheng, southwest to Wanglou, and directly south to Hukeng. The deep areas were about seven or eight chi deep, where double-awning masts could sail, and the shallow areas were also three or four chi deep. Fields and houses spanning more than twenty li east and west were all flooded, and the disaster was severe. Therefore, relief efforts cannot be delayed. (One Day)</p>

<p>Telephone Ceremony Held on September 1st</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The long-distance telephone between Guangzhou and Hong Kong was officially opened on the first of this month. First, Lin Yun'kai of the Guangdong Provincial Government and Governor Peel of Hong Kong exchanged congratulatory messages on the phone, followed by celebrations in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. The Guangzhou side held the ceremony at the Provincial Government, with attendees including the Chairman of the Provincial Government, the Mayor of Guangzhou, and representatives of various consulates. The Hong Kong side held the ceremony at the Hong Kong Telephone Company, with attendees including the Governor of Hong Kong, members of the Municipal Council, members of the Chamber of Commerce, the President of HSBC Bank, and representatives of various newspapers. This event was jointly organized by the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Hong Kong Telephone Company, requiring an estimated expenditure of over three million yuan. The telephone line was installed along the Kowloon-Canton Railway, approximately one hundred and fifty miles long, using the latest type of armored cable, manufactured by the London Standard Telephone &amp; Cables Company. The China General Edison Company on Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, is its liaison company. The telephone can simultaneously connect to thirty locations. Guangzhou telephone users must deposit thirty yuan before they can make calls to Hong Kong, with a charge of two yuan and seven jiao per three minutes. As business between Guangzhou and Hong Kong is known to be booming, this line will greatly benefit commerce in both places.</p>

<p>The Appeal Hearing of the Guan Daming Rape Case. The Story of the Remarkable Shanghai Woman Zheng Xuanying, Sister of Zheng Ying, Who Was Rescued After Attempting Suicide in the Huangpu River, and Accused Guan Daming, the Manager of the Gaultier Shoe Store at 152 Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai, of Rape, and Attached a Private Suit Seeking Compensation of 20,000 Yuan. After the Shanghai District Court ruled that Guan Daming was guilty of raping a woman under the age of twenty, and sentenced him to three years and six months of imprisonment, Guan refused to accept the ruling and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Suzhou Higher Court. Yesterday (the 2nd) morning, the presiding judge of the Second Criminal Division, Li Mian, opened the court to try Guan. Those who were summoned to court included the appellant Zheng Xuanying, Zheng's father Youhe, Meng Baosong, the accountant of the Xingaosheng Hotel, the waiter Wu Ronglin, and the original lawyers Wei Wenhan and Zhan Jifeng, and the lawyer Cao Lin, who handled the private suit for the appellant. First, Guan Daming was questioned. According to his testimony, the Qiuqin (i.e., Zheng Ying) sisters borrowed a house from me in March of last year and lived on the third floor. I was the sub-landlord, and the second floor of the store was occupied by outsiders. Because the Zheng sisters often used the front door when entering and exiting, I intervened, and they resented me for it and falsely accused me of rape. Next, Zheng Xuanying testified that she was seventeen years old, studying at Peide Elementary School, and her sister Qiuqin worked at the Shenghuo Newspaper Office. There were five people in her family, including her parents and a younger brother. Guan Daming was the sub-landlord, and we used the back door when entering and exiting. We did not have any quarrels with Guan. In June of last year, Guan first invited me to see a movie at the Da Guangming Cinema. On October 18th, he took me to Room 30 of the Xingaosheng Hotel on Wuma Road. Once, he opened a room at the Shenzhou Hotel at 204 Sima Road. The judge asked what we did when we opened the room. Xuanying blushed and did not speak, and began to cry softly. The judge then announced a temporary ban on public attendance. It was heard that Zheng Xuanying testified at the time that she had been raped twice. Later, she met her father on Gordon Road, who saw her riding in Guan Daming's chartered car, so he drove her out of the house after returning home. She then ran away on December 26th and lived in the home of Cai Yueying, a young woman on Carter Road, until she was rescued after attempting suicide in the Huangpu River on June 13th of this year. She is currently living at the home of Lawyer Cao. Then, the witness Meng Baosong testified that on the 18th day of the tenth lunar month last year, a man and a woman opened Room 30, and they left after only two hours. At that time, there was a business card with the words "Gaultier Shoe Store" printed on it. On the seventh day of the twelfth lunar month, she came again and opened Room 26, but it was only the woman alone. The traveler's single slip was written as Guan Daming, and she stayed for two days before leaving. The woman was indeed Zheng Xuanying. After the interrogation, the judge instructed that more witnesses should be summoned in this case, and a hearing would be scheduled again after further review.</p>
<p>Two People Drowned After a Brick Boat Was Hit. Cha Genggeng, a 26-year-old from Changshu, his wife Zhang, and his daughter Zhaoyuan, who was only two years old, loaded a boat with bricks and tiles from Xiaobaimi, Changshu, a few days ago, and went to Ma Shengtai outside Xumen, Suzhou, to unload the goods. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 1st), at 7:00 p.m., the boat arrived at the Dahui Bridge. In front of them was Zhou Genrong's coal boat. Because the boat was too heavy and the current was too strong, it could not move forward and instead retreated, causing the stern of the boat to hit the bow of the brick boat. The boat immediately shattered and sank. Cha and his wife and daughter all fell into the water. The Third District Water Police and the Water Patrol Team tried to rescue them. Only Cha Genggeng was rescued, and his wife and daughter were washed away by the waves and could not be found. Yesterday (the 2nd) afternoon, at 4:00 p.m., the body of Cha's wife, Zhang, was found near Dahui. The coal boat that caused the accident has been detained by the police station, and the perpetrator is being investigated.</p>

<p>Notorious Bandit Qin Ergou and Others Executed by Firing Squad. Notorious bandit Qin Ergou was an accomplice of the bandit leader Gao Xiaosheng. After Gao Xiaosheng was executed, Qin hid at sea and secretly returned to Changzhou from time to time to carry out activities. Recently, he was arrested in Shanghai by detectives sent by the county government. After being escorted to Changzhou, he confessed to various cases of kidnapping, ransom, and robbery without denial. Director Zhang, who was also the Director of the Local Clearance Bureau, immediately sentenced Qin and six other recently captured bandits, including Sheng Badu, Ji Binggen, Qian Fugeng, Jiang Xiqing, Jiang Maogan, and Jiang Bingsheng, to death and submitted the sentences to the provincial government for approval. At 6:00 a.m. on the 2nd, the police escorted Qin and the other seven to the execution ground, verified their identities, and executed them by firing squad.</p>

Guo Yanmo, the former manager of the Zhenjiang branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was sued by an employee, Ran Shaohua, for smoking opium. After two trials, he was sentenced to two months of imprisonment and a fine of one thousand yuan. The sentence was finalized long ago, but Guo had not reported to the authorities. Multiple warrants were issued to his guarantors to compel him to surrender. He was released on bail again. It is now known that Guo was found by his guarantors yesterday afternoon and escorted to the court to request the withdrawal of the bail and request immediate execution of the sentence. Prosecutor Li opened the court, questioned him, and immediately ordered him to be detained pending execution. His wife, Zhang, was arrested and executed last month and had completed her sentence yesterday. The elderly couple met in the waiting room, and their situation was very tragic.</p>

<p>The Jiangyin Regiment Police Were Arrested for Disregarding Human Life. On August 1st, Zhou Dougen from Zhuxiang, Zhouzhuang, was reported by Gu Zigen to capture Zhang Guangde (Nantuan Regiment Chief) from Zhang Deyuan's noodle shop in Houcheng and sent him to the Eighth District Office. Upon receiving the report, the Houcheng Business Regiment and the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, led by instructor Wu Kuan and Branch Chief Zhang Ke, went to rescue him, resulting in a conflict with the farmers there. (The Houcheng side referred to them as the Big Sword Society, while the Zhouzhuang side claimed they were only a self-defense group.) Instructor Wu Kuan ordered the firing of guns, killing Zhou Dougen and drowning Ding Zhuoan and Xu Bingxiang. After the official authorities examined the bodies, they summoned a thousand witnesses to investigate the case once. Yesterday (the 1st), they conducted interrogations for the first and second times. Peng County Magistrate interrogated Zhou Jiangshi, the wife of the deceased Zhou Dougen, and more than 20 witnesses including Zhou Yu'an and Zhou Huangniu. As a result of the interrogation, it was determined that the Business Regiment and the Public Security Bureau were both responsible for protecting the local people and could not treat them as enemies. Wu Kuan's statement that he fired more than sixty shots into the sky did not match the gunshot wounds on the bodies of the deceased, which was obviously an excuse and disregard for human life. He was ordered to be detained in the confinement room. Zhang Shouchang and Cao Guanghua, squad leaders of the Business Regiment, were detained in the guardhouse. Zhang Ke was released on bail from two shops, and the others were ordered to return.</p>

<p>Reasons for the Decline in Salt Sales on the Huainan Coast. Salt sales on the Huainan coast are declining daily. The Supervisory Bureau has investigated and found that the main reasons are the prevalence of smugglers and the continued unrest in various areas.

<p>The Red Bandits of Daxizhuang Were Completely Eliminated. Rugao's notorious bandit Yu Xian (also known as Yu Xiawan) sneaked back to carry out activities. In the past, he killed more than a dozen villagers in Xiwuzhuang and other places. The main culprit has not yet been arrested. On the 28th, Yu led more than a dozen bandits to ambush at the home of Miao Yuansheng in Daxizhuang, preparing to kill and set fires at night. Unexpectedly, Yang, the squad leader of the first squad of the first detachment of the county police, learned of this and immediately dispatched more than 20 soldiers to search and suppress them. At the same time, he informed Chen, the detachment leader, to dispatch more than 20 soldiers, as well as Li, the squad leader of Taixing, and Sun, the head of the Luhong Security Regiment, to surround the area on all sides. The bandits opened fire and resisted stubbornly, while lying in ambush inside the Miao residence, refusing to come out. The soldiers, seeing that the bandits were numerous, had many guns, and were hiding inside the house, had no way to attack. They devised a plan to set the house on fire, so that the bandits had nowhere to hide. When the bandits saw the fire, they fired fiercely, while still trying to break out. In the end, all the bandits hiding in the Miao residence were killed one by one. The notorious bandit Yu Xian was killed while trying to escape outside the Miao residence. Yesterday (the 29th), squad leader Yang transported Yu's corpse and two other bandit heads to the city and reported the situation to County Magistrate Qian. After being confirmed by Zhu Quan, the district chief of Zhentao, that it was indeed the notorious bandit Yu Xian, they were displayed in front of the Guan Yue Temple for public viewing.</p>

<p>A Murder Case Occurred in Youxi. Zhou Qideng and Wang Ayin from Chaitan, southern Linan, had long-standing grudges with Ye and Zhu Chaofeng from a neighboring village. Yesterday (the 29th), Chaofeng was buying food in Youxi when he was seen by Qideng and Ayin, who immediately shot Chaofeng several times with a handgun, hitting him in the head and killing him instantly. A stray bullet also injured Wang Ashui. The victim's family has reported the incident to the local judicial branch to examine the body and arrest the perpetrators. It is unknown whether they will be able to catch them. The Bandits in the Thirteenth Township Are Rampant. More than a hundred bandits have gathered in the Thirteenth Township of Xianju, looting and plundering extensively, creating a rampant situation. This was discovered by Wang Delong, the battalion commander of the Provincial Security Team, who dispatched three platoons of soldiers to suppress them the day before yesterday. However, the terrain there is treacherous, making it difficult to suppress. Four soldiers were killed by bullets and several soldiers were wounded. The battalion commander was furious upon hearing the news and has been mobilizing large forces to continue the suppression in order to eliminate the banditry.</p>

<p>Shen Yongguan's House Was Robbed. Shen Yongguan, a farmer in Xixiang, Cixi, is a hardworking and thrifty man from a modestly wealthy family. Yesterday morning, around 1:00 a.m., six or seven bandits suddenly arrived, broke down the door with a large stone, and openly carried out a robbery with torches and weapons. Upon seeing this, Yongguan escaped through the back window, and his family members hid in dark corners and were not attacked. However, more than 300 yuan in cash and valuables were all looted. The Sanqi City Public Security Bureau heard the news and immediately dispatched officers to arrest the bandits. By dawn, several suspects were apprehended in a certain temple. The secret investigation is continuing.</p>

The match between China and the French Chamber of Commerce was held yesterday at the French Chamber of Commerce on Avenue Joffre. The second group of the Chinese Club forfeited due to the absence of Guo Qida, losing all three points. In the entire match, only the first group, Tu Qian, scored two points, and the fifth group, Mao Guo, also scored two points. Tu Qian performed very well, but unfortunately, they were too aggressive in the second set, resulting in too many wild balls and unforced errors. Qian's double faults in serving also resulted in a considerable loss of points. Guo's absence seemed to affect the spirit, and the results are listed below:</p>

<p>Beiping Only Wins Two Singles Matches</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 31st Dispatch) The Pingjin Inter-City Tennis Tournament continued yesterday. A total of five singles and doubles matches were held, starting at 3:00 PM. The doubles match between the Long brothers and the Sa brothers, which was started earlier, continued, resulting in a defeat for the Sa brothers. Next were the singles match between Sa Bendong and Zheng Daohuang, the doubles match between Lin Baohua and Wu Shaoxiang against Gao Huimin and the Ze brothers, and the singles match between Yokota and Feibo. Shi Changli was absent yesterday due to some matter, so Sa Bentie played against Da Longgan instead. In the five matches, only Sa Bendong's singles match was won against Zheng Daohuang. The remaining victories all went to Tianjin. The overall result was five to two, with a great victory for the Tianjin team. The confrontations between the teams were generally unremarkable, vastly different from the intense competition during the Keio team's visit to Tianjin. The doubles match between Lin and Wu against the Gao brothers was originally intended to be the main battle of this inter-city tournament. Lin Baohua left Tianjin for Shanghai last night, and yesterday was his last match in Tianjin. He certainly gave it his all. Wu Shaoxiang also had unique strengths, but Gao Zemin on the opposing side lacked experience, panicking and struggling to cope, frequently missing good opportunities. With such a disparity in strength, there was naturally nothing spectacular to see. The results of each match are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e96">Second Doubles <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Da Longgan 6-3 Sa Bentie</p>
<p>(Tianjin) 3-6 (Beiping)</p>
<p>Er Longgan 6-0 Sa Bendong</p>
<p>In the two previous sets, the strengths of Beiping and Tianjin seemed quite evenly matched. Although the Sa brothers lacked steadiness, they had plenty of agility. However, shortly after the start of yesterday's match, Da Longgan's smashes suddenly became powerful, with both forehand and backhand shots being executed perfectly. The Sa brothers almost lost their ability to resist. On the scoreboard, only the Tianjin scores were seen rising continuously, while Beiping remained silent. During the fourth and fifth games, there was a brief counterattack, but it failed to materialize. In the end, they suffered a crushing defeat of two to one. The overall result was two to one, after which Tianjin gained the upper hand.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Second Singles <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>6-4</p>
<p>Lu Bendong (Beiping) Zheng Daohuang (Tianjin)</p>
<p>6-4</p>
<p>Sa Bendong is short and stout and, after returning to China the year before last, had already made a name for himself in Beiping tennis circles. Zheng Daohuang, on the other hand, is still young. Although he sometimes had excellent smashes and pressing shots, his receiving was unsteady and his serves were unreliable, resulting in frequent missed opportunities. After Sa Bendong won the first set 6-4, he completed the second set in one fell swoop, winning four games in a row. At this critical moment, Zheng was able to remain calm and composed. When the score reached 4-3, Sa realized that the opportunity would vanish in an instant, and he also fought hard to secure the final victory. After a period of back-and-forth play, he finally won again with a score of 6-4.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Third Doubles <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Lin Baohua 6-2 Gao Huimin</p>
<p>(Tianjin) (Beiping)</p>
<p>Wu Shaoxiang 6-2 Gao Zemin</p>
<p>The main battle began at 4:00 PM. Lin Baohua was in high spirits, and Wu Shaoxiang's pressing shots and net play showed significant improvement. The Gao brothers were both six feet tall and had agile physiques, making them talented tennis players. Although Gao Zemin's performance was not very good, his smashes had unique strengths. With future effort, he could become a very promising tennis player. Gao Huimin's hits seemed too slow, and he was not very fast, putting him at a disadvantage. As a result, both sets were lost 6-2.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Third Singles <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>6-3</p>
<p>Feite (Tianjin) Yokota (Beiping)</p>
<p>6-3</p>
<p>The match between Yokota and Feite was the most exciting battle of yesterday. Although neither player held a major position on their respective teams, their performances were excellent and they both played extremely well. It was a battle of equals, and the scores were closely contested, making it difficult to determine the outcome. In the end, Feite prevailed.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Fourth Singles <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>5-7</p>
<p>Da Longgan (Tianjin) 6-0 Sa Bentie (Beiping)</p>
<p>6-0</p>
<p>The match between Da Longgan and Sa Bentie was initially uneventful, with nothing particularly exciting. In the first set, Sa Bentie won 7-5. In the second set, Longgan unleashed his lifelong smashing skills, which Sa found increasingly difficult to cope with, suffering defeat after defeat, eventually losing 6-0 without any resistance. In the third set, Sa fell into a slump, while Da Longgan's momentum continued to surge, resulting in another dominant victory of 6-0, bringing the lively inter-city tournament to a close.</p>

<p>One: To Take Away the Opportunities of Jiangsu People</p>
<p>Two: It Would Be Unseemly for Both Parties</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Bangwei, the director of the Zhenjiang Public Sports Field in Jiangsu Province, came to Shanghai yesterday on official business. He made the following statement to reporters: For this National Games Jiangsu preliminary selection, the Education Department stipulated that only athletes within the scope of Jiangsu Province are allowed to participate. The entire team or individual athletes from Nanjing and Shanghai are uniformly rejected from registration. First, to take away the opportunities of Jiangsu Province athletes, and second, it would be unseemly for both parties. Jiangsu's sports results are certainly lagging behind, but if we rely on other units to slightly compete for a position in the National Games, then the glory gained would be dishonorable. Moreover, accepting athletes from outside the province would foster arrogance among athletes, making it even more unworthy.</p>

<p>▲ Rising Well At Six Liang and Three The bullion price rebounded and soared again yesterday and the day before, and the spinning trend cannot be contained. There was still a near encounter of a total of five liang. As a result, it rose again by six liang or so, and the progress of each firm's buying and selling was not smooth. Almost no changes in the silver market, but Citibank has the sale of silver, and there is also a saying that several banks have closed down in Citibank. The trend is high, so the gold price immediately opened high, rushing out of the 780 liang mark. After a while, there was a lurking around 80 liang, until the draft was slightly tight, and the market was strong. However, the trading was scattered, and the ups and downs were minimal. It happened to be Wednesday, and there was no foreign exchange market, and then it exceeded 83 liang.</p>
<p>▲ The Market Opened Up by Three and a Half Liang, Immediately Rising by Three and a Half Liang, Reaching 780 Liang and 0.03 Qian. The Main Bars Did Not Move. However, US stocks fell by more than two yuan, followed by 80 Liang and 0.05. Zhifeng, Yonghong, Lishang, Tai Chang, Heng Yu and others sold out, and immediately fell to 78 Liang and a Half. Suddenly, Fuyu, Cuichang, Yongchunyuan, Yongdeng and other speculators bought in, and then turned to the peak. The draft was still flat. The British gold settlement in November was over 12.8125, and the Japanese gold was 3 Liang 6 Qian 5 Fen to 4 Fen 875. Until the British gold was announced to be 82 Liang and 8 Qian, the listing was as before, followed by 2 Liang 3 Qian and 4 Qian, and the buyers were still strong, and it had already risen to 83 Liang. The internal dish British gold is calculated to be close to 12.75 in and out. Later, Bingxing, Hongxing, Yufa, Yongyuan, Mao Yong and others came to sell off, and it was heard that India intended to enter silver to make up for the short positions. Therefore, the people were shocked and fell by more than three liang. At 10:30, it was 79 Liang and 6 Qian, followed by a rise of one liang, to 80 Liang and 0.09 Qian. However, there was not much trading. After 10:30, Yuan Maoyong, Hengxing, Zhifeng, Yongdeng and others sold out, so it entered the 80 Liang mark again, but the ups and downs were only a few coins.

<p>Silver Collection is Quite Strong</p>
<p>▲ Market Overview Yesterday, the situation of the Dime discount in the market was still stable and loose. The two situations have no hope of rising now. However, looking at the bank's collection yesterday, the special loans were very strong, and other regular collections also seemed to be slightly more. As for the needs, when various ports are experiencing floods, the commercial category rate is greatly affected, and of course there is no possibility of eager demand. Although Shanghai has not suffered this natural disaster, the previous hurricane flooded the lower areas, and the loss of goods was also considerable. Therefore, at present, whether it is a bustling city in finance and commerce, it is not helpful to the actual situation.</p>
<p>▲ Dime Discount Price (Foreign Dime) The dime price in the early market was still the same as the previous day, at seven qian, two fen, four li, eight hao, and seven hu and a half. There was no difference in the noon market, and the stability of the situation is indescribable. (Silver Discount) After a period of tightening a few days ago, it has recently become looser. Yesterday morning, it was one qian and one fen, which was already five fen less than the early market the previous day. The noon market fell another three fen, to eight fen. The bank's listing also fell two fen, to four fen. The top of the line was actually drawn in vain without adding water.</p>
<p>▲ Auxiliary Currency Market The situation of the Jiangnan small ocean suddenly changed in the early market, to six qian, five fen, five li and a half, which was another rise of one li compared to the noon market the previous day. The noon market continued to soar by four li, Ma Liu Qian Wu Fen Jiu Li Ban. The reason for the rise is still nothing more than the scramble to buy by small peers, resulting in a transaction of 20,000 jiao in the early market and 14,000 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small ocean, the early market was six qian four fen six li and the noon market was six qian four fen six li and a half, which was also a rise of more than one li and two li and a week compared to the previous day. The transactions made were 230,000 jiao in the early market and 85,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were reduced by 1,000 wen, to 373,500 wen.</p>

<p>Others Also Fell by One or Two Yuan</p>
<p>Customs Duty 69 Stable, Market Slightly Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local securities market, the trading of various bonds was not lonely in the morning, but the trend continued to be flat. In the afternoon market, the ups and downs of prices were huge, and the market was also very lively. However, the current market is still sparse. The changes in the market prices of various bonds, when they were opened in the early morning, were due to the weakness of the market and the strong selling sentiment. A certain party had a huge amount of sales, and the demand and supply were very different, and the decline was quite strong. Afterwards, the sellers still dominated, and the decline continued. At the beginning of the afternoon, the downward trend was even more intense, but the buyers took the opportunity to buy in at the close, which was very enthusiastic. Therefore, the price rose slightly, but as a result, it was still much lower than the previous day, such as the 20 customs duty falling by two yuan, and other small one or two yuan. The salt tax fell by two yuan and seven corners and a half in September. Only the price of the 96 customs duty was set. The total spot transaction for the whole day was only 3,000 yuan. The futures market opened at 10 million yuan in the morning, and there were also more than 7.3 million in the afternoon market, totaling 17.3 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is calm, but overseas conditions are also flat, so the market is extremely scattered, with no spirit of revitalization. Although the environment in the four parks is harsh, the lack of a large number of new sellers is even more apparent, and the market can still be maintained. However, the vacancy of a certain giant merchant is special, and the pressure has not yet arrived, and the pressure is still heavy. The attitude of a certain manufacturer on behalf of a certain factory is very strong, and it is hard to collect goods. It is said that a part of the ten-count yarn has been searched by the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs, so the market is soft and hard.</p>
<p>▲ The Human Standard Rose by 345 Qian The Human Standard Market opened, and the price rose immediately after the decline in foreign cotton, the market was flat, but the selling sentiment in the market was not strong, and the near price rose by 1.4 qian, and the far price was flat. In the afternoon, the situation was slightly firm, and the prices of various months rose by 2, 3, and 4 qian. The transaction statistics were 11,300 packages. It was found that Ruida sold 1,350 packages, Xiesheng sold 600 packages, and Gengfeng bought 2,500 packages, Daji bought 300 packages, Yuda bought 450 packages, and Dafu bought 400 packages.

<h3 id="e115">Cotton Market Stability <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable, but the conditions for American and Indian cotton remain pessimistic. Therefore, various foreign firms are competitively selling foreign cotton in the market, seeking a way out due to excessive inventory. As a result, prices are quite low, and factories are purchasing a significant amount of Rangoon cotton. Consequently, large players are actively selling off their holdings. However, the majority of local cotton merchants are leaning towards a bullish outlook, as the cotton fields in Hankou have suffered severe damage from floods, and the inventory of old cotton is low. Although the selling price of foreign cotton is low, it cannot reach Shanghai in time. The price of gold is also firm, and the outstanding debt is too large, with many non-industry players selling short. It will be difficult to avoid being squeezed later. Therefore, the volume sold off by large players in recent days has been almost entirely absorbed by their peers, and the situation can still be maintained. In summary, the depression in the global cotton industry has a significant impact.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Standard Leveling: The Hankou standard pre-market opened with a slight drop in American cotton, softening market sentiment. Although there were large players, there were also many buyers. As a result, it fell slightly by five points. The afternoon was flat, with a total transaction volume of 72,100 dan. Sales included Changhe 5,200 dan, Ruiyuan 3,300 dan, No. 40 6,500 dan, Ruida 4,400 dan, and Changfeng 3,700 dan. Purchases included Deji 4,400 dan, Dachang 2,700 dan, Yuanda 3,500 dan, Tianlong 1,300 dan, and Shenchang 1,400 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Closing Prices (Fluctuations) (Outstanding Accounts)</p>
<p>December: 34.40 (-0.2) (68,400)</p>
<p>October: 34.60 (Up 0.05) (150,000)</p>

<p>November: 44.5 (269,900)</p>
<p>February: 34.25 (1068,000)</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Demand Gradually Moving: The demand for spot cotton is gradually moving because the inventory of old cotton is very low, so each factory is worried about the shortage of new cotton. The source is estimated to be 1320 bales of Yao flower.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 35.40: Honghua Factory imported 100 pieces of spot goods to the factory.</p>
<p>Rangoon Flower 32.00: Shenxin Factory imported 500 pieces for December delivery to the factory.</p>

<p>▲ In Nanshi Ye Shu Nanqiao, new japonica rice has been loaded onto ships, amounting to 200 shi. The quality of the rice is good, and the initial price is 15 yuan and 3 jiao. However, there are some urban-rural transactions involving old goods. Due to the obscure weather, fresh goods are still in demand, but the supply of medium-grade goods is sluggish. After the price increases, the market is stable. Although early and late rice have weakened slightly, local buyers are picking fresh goods and advancing prices slightly. The new japonica rice goods are still sporadic, and higher-quality ones are still available, while lower-quality ones are normal. The prices of Yanglu tip and Biantou are fixed tightly.</p>
<p>▲ The market in Xin Zha hasn't been able to turn around. There are not many people at the market in the morning, and appetite is low. Thick japonica rice continues to tighten by one jiao. People are losing interest. New japonica rice and early and late rice opened at a settled price. Yanglu tip and Butip are out of stock, and prices have also increased by about one jiao. Transactions of No. 1 and No. 2 Biantou are becoming more active. Kunshan rice is not selling well, and prices continue to fall. Foreign rice spot sales are sluggish, and customer assistance is stagnant. The situation is mediocre. The supply from the west is still surging, with about 323,300 shi of various goods from river factories being sold.</p>

<p>Market price drops by 3-4 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions: Spot prices fell by 3-4 jiao. Only then did Benjie sell 450 bags of Qieladi, priced at only 13 yuan and 3 jiao. A small amount of 200 tons of recycled Jiaoxiao was sold, also down by 30%. Yesterday's price decline was mainly due to a new batch of foreign rice arriving, totaling 50,000 bags, loaded by Renji Bingchang, etc. Although they were displayed on the market, no one inquired about them. Moreover, there are still large orders scheduled to arrive in the coming days. It is said that a total of more than 200,000 bags will arrive this month. The local appetite for Taizhou rice is very good, and the market is also firm. 100 bags of Taizhou white rice were offered at 13 yuan and 1 jiao, and 500 bags of rice were offered at 11 yuan and 2 jiao. The quality of the goods is better, and the price is also higher than the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Flour Market Turns Attractive <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>After the opening in the morning and afternoon, the flour market gradually showed a stable and attractive situation. Although actual sales were not moving and transactions were not smooth, some people believe that the 1,500 bushels of US wheat for disaster relief reported may be suspended due to unresolved conditions. If it cannot be determined, then the digestion of Shanghai's inventory will inevitably surge. Therefore, some floating longs are taking advantage of the trend to absorb them. Although transactions are not strong, the market sentiment is gradually rising. However, based on the speculation of the wheat market abroad, it is still in surplus. In any case, the Shanghai market should have little fear of shortages. As a result, this month is up 1 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day, October is up 1 fen, November is up 1 fen and 2.5 li, December is up 1.5 fen, and February is up 1 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Wheat Futures Seemingly in a Stable Situation <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>After the opening in the morning and afternoon, the wheat market seemed to turn stable. Although the quoted prices of foreign wheat did not change much, the US wheat borrowed by the government from the United States was currently suspended because the two sides had not fully agreed. People inside and outside the port inevitably worried about this. There were few sell-offs, and buyers were still sufficient to support the market. Therefore, near and far terms have all improved. However, according to the speculation of the general public, this disaster relief wheat will eventually be realized sooner or later. As a result, September and October each rose 3 fen from the previous day, November rose 2 fen, and December to February each rose 3 fen. The spot wheat market situation remains stagnant, with few transactions. Six-Hop wheat was offered at 3 taels, 7 qian, and 1 fen, and Double Phoenix wheat was offered at 3 taels, 7 qian, and 2 fen, totaling 700 bags, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Sugar Market Limited Trading, Quiet Inflow and Outflow <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Dumping Falls Further</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market area telegram: The price of Cuban spot sugar is 1.375, down 3125 from the previous telegram. New York sugar futures for September are 1.32, December is 1.30, March next year is 1.34, and May is 1.39, with only May falling by 1 fen from before, and the other months unchanged. The association's trading was very quiet. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white new goods were 11 taels and 7 qian, and old goods in white bags were 11 taels and 6 qian. No. 20 medium sand white was 11 taels, new goods were 11 taels and 2 qian, and No. 8 Dutch red was 9 taels and 4 qian. The trend is generally stable. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 12 taels, DY mark was 11 taels and 8 qian, HX mark was 11 taels, 7 qian and 7.5 fen to 7 qian, HM mark was 11 taels, 4 qian and 2.5 fen. Demand is not strong, and the market is also weak and lacks vitality. Dumped coarse sand white is falling more and more. Sassoon's bag was 5 yuan, 7 jiao and 8 fen, with no interest at all. Huaxin's bag price for shipments in October and November was 5 yuan and 7 jiao, with few recipients. The market sentiment is generally weak. The Hao Pan had Zhenxiang Hao selling thousands of bags of Hong Kong transportation goods, with Dutch red priced at 9 taels and 4 qian. At the same time, Huaxin sold more than a thousand bags of raw rice goods, priced at 9 taels and 5 qian. The market is still firm.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Silk and Tea, Double Palace Cocoon Goods are Scarce and Prices are High <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲ The cost of silk requires more than 600 taels... All five silk factories have resumed operations. Five local Double Palace silk factories had previously reduced their machines and suspended operations due to sluggish silk sales, high raw material prices, and heavy losses. After the new cocoons were listed, only three Double Palace silk factories started work. Now that the silk industry public bonds have begun to be issued, the Double Palace silk factories can also enjoy the rights of public bonds. Therefore, the two factories that have suspended work have now also received public bonds and started machines to work. Double Palace cocoon goods are scarce and sales are smooth, and the quoted price is rising. Each 100 jin of silk costs 640 taels, plus reeling labor, etc., and the cost of silk requires more than 800 taels.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Last Night at Shihudang Station <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Military Train and Passenger Train Collide</p>
<p>More Than Ten Injured on Each Side</p>
<p>Vehicles Not Seriously Damaged</p>
<p>At Shihudang Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, at around 7:30 last night, the Beijing-Hangzhou express train and a military train collided. More than ten passengers and soldiers were injured. Rescue vehicles were dispatched for repairs, and traffic is expected to be restored. The long-distance telephone line on that route was damaged at around 7:00 beforehand, so details could not be fully ascertained. The details of the collision are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Military Train Departure The 2nd Division, 4th Brigade, 7th Regiment of the Shangxing Bridge Garrison Army, was ordered to defend the Songhu area. They requested three trains from the Railway Bureau to be sent to the South Bridge Station for use. After the Railway Bureau prepared them, they were dispatched in three special trains yesterday. The first train, with 24 cars, carried the first battalion of the regiment, departing at 10:00 am to Longhua. The second train, with 26 cars, carried the second battalion, departing at 12:40 pm to the North Station. The third train, with 25 cars, carried the entire third battalion, departing at 2:00 pm, heading directly to Wusong to disembark and garrison.</p>
<p>▲Express Train Also Arrives When the third military train arrived at Shihudang Station at around 7:30 last night, the 32nd Beijing-Hangzhou express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou also arrived at the station to exchange trains.</p>
<p>▲Usual Train Operation According to the usual train operation of that route, when two trains arrive at the station at the same time to exchange trains, the train that arrives first can proceed directly to the platform and park properly. Then, the other train is allowed to enter the station. Whether or not a train can enter the station is based on whether the flag is lowered or not.</p>
<p>▲Collision Situation At around 7:30 last night, the third military train entered the station first. According to regulations, the head of the 32nd Beijing-Hangzhou express train waited outside with the flag raised, waiting for the military train to park properly at the platform. Only after seeing the flag lowered could it enter. Unexpectedly, last night, the 32nd Beijing-Hangzhou express train, without waiting for the flag to be lowered, proceeded directly to the platform, entering the same track at the same time. With a loud bang, they collided. Fortunately, both sides were moving slowly, and no major danger was caused.</p>
<p>▲Locomotive Damaged After the trains collided, the iron on the front of the train was damaged.  The hooks of each car were also  not seriously damaged. After the damage to the locomotive, etc., is slightly repaired,  it can restore its original condition.</p>
<p>▲Rescue Train Dispatched After receiving the news from the North Station, the responsible personnel of several departments discussed and decided to dispatch a rescue train from the North Station to make repairs, so that normal operation could be restored. The rescue train departed from the North Station at 11:05 pm, heading directly to Shihudang.</p>
<p>▲Passengers and Soldiers Injured After the two trains collided, more than ten passengers and soldiers in the trains suffered minor injuries. None were in life-threatening condition. After doctors provided some bandages, they could leave the station.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Navigation News During the Flood <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>▲Refugee Epidemic Prevention Inoculation This time, the Yangtze River ports suffered severe floods. Many disaster victims from Hankou and Wuhu have come to Shanghai. Wherever there is a major flood, there is bound to be an epidemic, because the water is dirty and easily breeds epidemics. The Harbor Quarantine Office has decided to implement vaccinations for disaster victims when they disembark from ships in Hankou and Wuhu. When each ship arrives in Shanghai, it will also be inspected, starting from the 4th of this month.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Rescue Overseas Merchants There are many Japanese in various ports along the Yangtze River. After the flood occurred this year, the Japanese in Shanghai formed a flood relief team of the Tongren Association. They have requested the Nisshin Steamship Company of this port to send the Xiangjiang Maru, carrying 10 doctors, 7 clerks, 16 nurses, and 6 employees, a total of more than 40 people. They have prepared medicines in Shanghai and set off for Wuhu, Hankou, Changsha, and other places to rescue Japanese people.</p>
<p>▲Hunan Goods Expedited for Export Many European and American countries purchase minerals and tung oil from Hunan Province, and sesame from Yichang and Shashi, for export. Usually, these goods are transported from Hunan to Hankou, and then transferred to Shanghai for export. Recently, the warehouses in Hankou have been submerged in water. The goods cannot be unloaded upon arrival in Hankou. So, the Hunan merchants telegraphed Shanghai, requesting that these goods be transported directly to Shanghai for export and requesting expedited loading. Therefore, Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have added Hunan route ships to transport Hunan cargo to Shanghai, without stopping in Hankou, and then transferring to Jiang ships to Shanghai. The American merchants in Shanghai have already loaded the purchased minerals for export. The first batch has arrived in recent days and is being declared for export, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Japanese Emperor's Relief Fund Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Consulate Delivered the Disaster Relief Fund</p>
<p>Equivalent to More Than 226,000 Chinese Dollars</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, it was rumored that the Japanese Showa Emperor generously donated 100,000 Japanese yen to China for flood relief and had already sent it to Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee of the National Government, last time. This is not true. According to sources at the Japanese Consulate General in this port, the funds were only delivered yesterday (2nd) morning at 10:00 am by Mr. Okazaki, secretary of the embassy, with a handwritten letter from Minister Chongguang to Chairman Song, and a Yokohama Specie Bank draft, to the secretariat of the Disaster Relief Committee of the National Government at 1 Jiujiang Road for collection. Based on yesterday's market price of Japanese yen, the equivalent in Chinese currency was 226,950 yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>▲Soliciting Clothing and Bedding Yesterday, the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, based on a telegram from a special commissioner sent to Wuhan to investigate the disaster, said that the weather upstream had suddenly turned cold and the disaster victims were shivering from the cold, which was unbearable to witness. Chairman Song immediately appointed Huang Renlin to handle the solicitation of clothing and bedding to be transported to the disaster area. It is reported that Huang Renlin has begun planning after receiving the order. The general plan is as follows: (1) Send letters to chambers of commerce, charitable organizations, and church organizations to solicit donations on their behalf; (2) Solicit items such as clothing, trousers, shoes, hats, quilts, mattresses, etc., anything that can keep warm is included in the solicitation; (3) After collection, inspection will be carried out: A. Disinfection B. Washing C. Mending D. Sorting; (4) The organization or individual that solicits the most donations will be praised and rewarded by the committee. It is also heard that the official letters to be sent to each organization to serve as collection points will be issued tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Telegram from Cheng Jingsheng from Zhenjiang <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Addressed to the following esteemed gentlemen: Chairman Zhu of the National Government Relief Committee Working Group, Chairman Xu of the Committee, Standing Committee Members of the Emergency Relief Committee Yu, Wang, Zhang, and Wu, and Gentlemen of the Suzhou Relief Committee Wang, Huang, Wen, Wu, and Lu: Telegram number 30 has been sent. This morning, I departed with Chairman Ye, Director Li, and Xia Feng towards Yang, to meet with Song Qiao and Xiao Gu to discuss the establishment of refugee camps. The number of disaster victims flocking to the Gao Shao refugee camps is extremely high, and the three camps are insufficient, so additional camps have been set up. At noon, we arrived at Shao. The water level has dropped by more than ten feet, and the embankment walls have been completely submerged in the entire town. Not a single roof can be seen. At that time, more than 20,000 people were adrift in the river. The houses on the embankment are dilapidated, and the disaster victims are gathered together. Food is being sent daily from the Yang camps. Beyond the exposed Jin and western embankments, it is a vast expanse of water. More than 3,000 disaster victims from the Fifth District are still sleeping in the open. The waters are treacherous and ferries cannot land. We are hiring small boats to circumnavigate the lake to provide relief and send people to the Yang refugee camps. We then arrived outside Youcheng. More than 10,000 households in the town have been washed away without a trace. Only the treetops are swaying above the towering white waves. Inside the city, the water is chest-deep, and rescue boats are frequently going back and forth. The south of the city is safe and is a gathering place for disaster victims. Refugees have already been received from rooftops and treetops during sunny days, and a retreat to Yang has been opened. However, between the protective embankments, corpses are everywhere, and the stench is unbearable. It is a tragic sight to behold. There are eleven major breaches, ranging in width from dozens of feet to one hundred sixty or seventy feet. The water is raging fiercely and is expanding daily. According to Xia Feng Shu Xiang, it is currently impossible to obtain soil to plug the breaches, and it is inevitable that the three lakes will shift eastward. Ferries to various villages are impassable. Public announcements have been made to civilian boats to rescue disaster victims and send them to various camps along the way, with each person receiving five dimes per ocean dollar. Thirty relief workers have been assigned to carry food for distribution. Currently, the waters of Taidongxing are rising. More than 10,000 households in the three towns of Shibao, Gao West Village, Song Guo, and Zhu Qiao have been completely swept away by the lake waves. The dilapidated houses are all in the water, with only black shadows remaining. Post-disaster recovery efforts at various breaches are being discussed by Chairman Ye and Mr. Wang Wu. The most urgent need is to immediately transport 500 shi of coarse rice and 10,000 bags of wheat flour to be distributed by the Zhen authorities under the control of Jing. The number of disaster victims being rescued will inevitably be large. The Yang and Zhen refugee camps are insufficient, so please prepare in Shanghai. More details to follow. Cheng Jingsheng bows. East.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Ning Shao Emergency Relief Association for the Hankou Disaster Held a General Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Ning Shao Emergency Relief Association for the Hankou Disaster convened a temporary emergency meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association yesterday at 4:00 PM. More than 50 people attended, including Yu Qiaqing, Xu Qianlin, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Xiaoyu, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Yansong, Lou Xunru, Sun Meitang, Zhang Jiguang, Yan Chengde, Ge Yucheng, Lu Zhinan, and Yu Futian. Fang Jiaobo was elected as chairman. The meeting reported on the recent water disaster in Hankou and the situation of the relief team sent by the association to Hankou, which had returned to Shanghai. Representative Hong Xuefan stood up and briefly stated that the team departed on the 22nd and arrived in Hankou on the afternoon of the 25th. Small boats were dispatched to rescue fellow villagers in various parts of Hankou. The first trip of the "Xin Ning Xing" carried more than 1,500 disaster-stricken fellow villagers. The second trip of the "Yong Xing" carried more than 400 fellow villagers. Because most of the fellow villagers on the ships wanted to return to their hometowns, the "Yong Xing" was sent directly to Ningbo. All the staff of the team, except for a few who remained in Hankou, returned with the ship. The detailed situation has already been reported to the association via letters and telegrams from time to time, so I will not elaborate further. Next, Director Mao Heyuan reported on the accounting situation, briefly stating that the total amount of cash brought by the team to Hankou was 2,000 ocean dollars, specifically for use on the ship and for temporary relief. The current expenditures include 660 ocean dollars for rice, over 350 ocean dollars for tea and labor on the "Xin Ning Xing," over 300 ocean dollars for food and other expenses on the "Yong Xing," and over 370 ocean dollars for travel expenses for the staff on the "Longhe" and "Shangchuan" (Director Mao Heyuan, Doctor Xing Xuefan, and Xie Qigang paid for their own boat tickets, alcohol, and other expenses and did not claim any expenses from the association). Other miscellaneous expenses are listed in a detailed bill, which was prepared and reported by Chen Yuansheng, the accountant sent by the accounting committee member Lou Xunru, and can be verified. As for the food prepared by the director, it was brought in large quantities, including cigarettes and alcohol, because the stay in Hankou was uncertain, also to prevent the spread of disease. It has now been decided that Mao Heyuan, Hong Xuefan, and Xie Qigang will pay for these food items themselves to avoid external criticism. Next, Doctor Xie Qigang reported that one-third of the fellow villagers in Hankou were ill, and there would inevitably be a major epidemic after the flood. A preventive hospital should be established as soon as possible. Zhang Shenzhi then reported that fellow villagers in Hankou had already organized preparations for a preventive hospital through the Hubei Fellow Villagers Association, but funding was needed from the association. It was resolved that the association would subsidize 10,000 ocean dollars. Finally, the chairman proposed that the ship rental from the Sanbei Company be paid at 80% of the actual cost. The second proposal was to donate to the association. Finally, all the representatives present stood up to express their gratitude and condolences to Director Mao, Hong, Xie, and the staff of the relief team to Hankou. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Appeal from the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai received a telegram from County Magistrate Du of Yancheng yesterday. Yancheng is located downstream of the Huaiyun River. Since the opening of the three dams, including Cheluo, the water has flowed straight down, and the entire territory has become a swamp. On August 25, the postal Shao Yun embankment suddenly collapsed again, pouring down and flowing eastward. In the western corner, the submerged fields are more than seven or eight feet deep. Even those with dikes to defend were mostly destroyed. Young people clung to trees waiting for rescue, and most of the women and children drowned. Houses were gone, and cooking was impossible. The scene was heartbreaking and unbearable. After learning this, the Fellow Villagers Association, in addition to rushing to raise emergency relief, has requested the provincial government and the Shanghai Water Disaster Relief Committee to send personnel to investigate and provide assistance. It has also sent a telegram requesting the Jiangbei Water Conservancy Bureau to block the collapsed embankments of the Grand Canal to reduce the downward flow.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Hankou Water Disaster Emergency Relief Association Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhu Huaibing, a member of the Hubei Provincial Government of the Hankou Water Disaster Emergency Relief Association, Kai Juntian, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, Zhou Xingtang, a representative of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Yi, a representative of the Bankers Association, and other gentlemen arrived in Shanghai and stayed at No. 88 Yipinxiang. It is said that they are begging for relief for millions of disaster victims in Wuhan and have brought photos of the disaster situation on the ground. They plan to hold a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce to report and ask various institutions, groups, and businesses in Shanghai to unite to provide relief and blessings to the disaster victims. It is believed that people in Shanghai are happiest when doing good deeds and will provide as much help as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Disaster Relief Work of the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲Loading Flour for Emergency Relief to Hankou The Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association, due to the lack of food for the disaster victims in Hankou, specially went to the Fufeng Flour Factory yesterday to pick up 500 bags of flour and handed them over to the Longhe vessel to be released in Hankou. Father Rao Jiaju, a Western member of the association, had already set off for Hankou and is expected to arrive on the 2nd. Father Rao will then find ways to distribute it. When the flour was being released, a worker, claiming to be from Hubei, also donated one yuan to help with the relief.</p>
<p>▲Jiangbei Branch Associations Report Establishment The Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association, due to the severity of the disaster in Jiangbei, found that it was not easy to balance work and relief without organization during relief efforts. Therefore, it established branch associations in the disaster areas of Jiangbei to facilitate relief work. Yesterday, it received telegrams from Xinghua, Yancheng, Taixian, Qingjiangpu, and Yangzhou, all reporting their establishment.</p>
<p>▲Overseas Chinese Actively Donate Funds The Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association received donations from overseas Chinese from four sources yesterday: (1) The Singapore Rice Merchants Association telegraphed 5,000 ocean dollars; (2) ChunHoon, a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant from Honolulu, remitted 5,000 ocean dollars through the Shanghai Bank; (3) The Kuala Lumpur Renjing Drama Society remitted 4,000 ocean dollars, and the Overseas Chinese Public School remitted 200 ocean dollars; (4) The Seattle Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in the United States remitted 6,000 ocean dollars.</p>
<p>▲The Jiangxin Ship Carried Refugees to Shanghai Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangxin ship arrived in Shanghai from Hankou. In addition to passengers, it carried more than 300 disaster victims. According to the ship's staff, the ship carried more than 800 disaster victims when it left port, all from Hubei, Mianyang, Hankou, Hunan, Anhui, and other places. The ship stopped to load and unload cargo along the way, and some disaster victims disembarked at various ports. It is estimated that 100 people disembarked at Jiujiang, Anqing was not allowed to board or disembark, 200 people disembarked at Datong, and about 300 people disembarked at Nanjing, so that only more than 300 people arrived in Shanghai. Most of them were poor people fleeing the disaster. Except for a small number who came to Shanghai to seek refuge with relatives and friends, the remaining 200 people were taken in by the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Disaster Relief Association, and housed in the Zhabei refugee camp.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Feng Jishan Hall's Grand Vision of Donating Rent <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Feng Jishan Hall sent a letter to the Emergency Relief Committee, stating: "Dear Sirs, the continuous rain this summer has caused a disaster unprecedented in a century. According to newspaper reports, the disaster area covers as much as 1.5 million square miles, and the number of disaster victims, in Wuhan alone, is as many as 300,000. If we combine the disaster areas of 16 provinces, it is probably no less than 50 to 60 million. Houses have been washed away, and fields have been completely destroyed. The vast calamity is a terrible blow. All those who are human should follow the teachings of universal love and contribute generously to overcome this crisis. The managers of our hall, considering the severity of the disaster and the urgent needs of the disaster victims, believe that all people in the country must follow the example of those who have been entrusted with great responsibilities and actively contribute to overcome the crisis. Therefore, the hall has been instructed to set a plan to donate the rent collected for the entire year after deducting expenses. The entire rent for the first month (starting from July of this year) will be donated. For the second month to the twelfth month, 5% of the rent collected will be donated as a relief fund. The total amount of the donation for the entire year has been calculated to be 1,501 taels, 5 mace and 5 fen of silver (equivalent to 2,068 ocean dollars and 25 cents). A check for this amount is being sent. We hope that you will accept it on our behalf for disaster relief. This small contribution is not enough to save the burning cart of wood, but we hope that benevolent gentlemen will make a grand vision and contribute from the income of their properties and lands, either according to the plan we have proposed or by proposing other plans, all are acceptable. If the property still has mortgages or other loan relationships, it may be possible to first deduct the interest on the mortgage or other loans, and then donate as much as possible, regardless of the amount. In short, this matter should be initiated from the heart, without waiting for others to solicit donations. The entire country should unite to overcome this national crisis, in order to open a path to life for tens of millions of disaster victims. Otherwise, the number of disaster victims is so large, they are already without food or clothing, waiting to die. What can they not do? Once they take the risk, not only will social order and human peace be impossible to maintain, but also the economy and property of areas not affected by the disaster will be destroyed. In the past, the great rebellions at the end of the Sui and Yuan dynasties all started with the people living in misery, and the bandits of the late Ming dynasty ravaged the whole world. It all started with seeing the disaster and not helping, until resentment accumulated and exploded. It was too late to regret. The rich and noble, especially those with large properties, suffered the most from looting. Similar mistakes are repeated, and history is full of such examples. Moreover, the value of property depends on the regulation of consumption and production to maintain balance. Now, the production side has been lost due to the displacement of tens of millions of people, and the consumption side has increased as a result. Will the country's economy not fall into a state of collapse? What value can property have? Therefore, today's matter is actually saving oneself while saving others. It is directly saving people's lives and indirectly protecting one's own property. It is impossible not to think deeply about it. Furthermore, since the 19th century, science has flourished, with a progress that can be measured in leaps and bounds. Its contribution to mankind is immense, but there is still no way to avoid the spread of natural disasters. This is not only true for our country, but also for European and American countries. For example, the earthquake in Italy last year, the snowstorm in England this year, the drought in the United States, and the great earthquake in Japan in previous years, all cannot be stopped by science. This is not the fault of science itself, but mankind, having trusted in the omnipotence of science, cannot help but harbor doubts about religion, or even slander various religions, wanting to destroy them all at once. How can we know that we will not offend Heaven and bring about disasters? Moreover, even with science, pushing its omnipotence, the use of electricity, air, and Feng Shui is also inexhaustible. Having taken what is inexhaustible, how can we know that we will not change the climate of nature directly and indirectly, brewing various disasters? Therefore, although science is omnipotent, it can never control this nature. Since it cannot control this nature, it cannot but have a devout belief in this nature. This is the meaning of the saying "Heaven protects" in our Confucianism. Now that disasters are coming, and the people are not living well, it is important to raise funds for relief. After the pain has subsided, we should all rise up with faith to meet the blessings of Heaven. All those who are saving people and those who are suffering from the disaster should have this awareness and not say that the matter involves superstition and can be rejected. This is the foolish opinion of our humble selves, which cannot be avoided in words, and is hoped to be enlightened by all gentlemen. The above is all the intention of the manager of our hall, who instructed us to convey it, and did not want to come forward in his own name, so we avoid it. Our hall is called Jishan Hall, which takes the meaning of accumulating good deeds. It is not a charity organization, but only an office for managing ordinary real estate. We hereby declare this together. We respectfully ask for your understanding. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Emergency Relief Committee for the Water Disaster in Various Provinces, Feng Jishan Hall respectfully, August 29, 20th year.</p>

<p>▲ Suspension of All Routes After the ticket sellers went on strike again, public buses in the Public Concession, Route 2 (Er Yangjing to Park Shooting Range), Route 5 (Sanmaoge Bridge to North Railway Station), and Route 10 (Caojiadu to Yinxiangxiang) were completely suspended.

Therefore, last month, they jointly telegraphed the National Government to approve the cancellation of the arrest warrant and restore his freedom. The National Government telegraphed the Shanghai Special City Party Department to investigate and reply. The City Party Department has complied with the order and replied. The State Council has resolved that since there is no definite evidence that Feng Shaoshan is against the government and he meets the amnesty decree previously issued by the National Government, his request to restore his freedom should be approved. However, instead of issuing a formal decree, the National Government telegraphed Yu Qiaqing and four others. Mr. Yu received the National Government's telegram yesterday and immediately telegraphed Feng's family in Beiping.</p>

<p>Lv Hu Ningbo compatriots Le Zhenbao and Zhang Jiguang recently went to Ningbo to inspect the Lao Jiang Bridge and plan the reconstruction project. After arriving in Ningbo, County Magistrate Chen of Yin County and Engineer Hu met with them to discuss the construction of the Lao Jiang Bridge. According to Mr. Le and Mr. Zhang, the current of the Lao Jiang Bridge is so turbulent that if it is entirely constructed with cement and steel, there will be many piles, and the current will be even more turbulent, and navigation will be even more inconvenient. It is now proposed to change the bridge body to a steel structure, and the piles and piers will still be made of steel and cement, so that the number can be reduced, and the current may be able to remain the same. Also, the Jiangdong Yangmu wedge must be rebuilt, otherwise, in the event of a large tide, the current of the Lao Jiang Bridge will be even more turbulent. After consultation with County Magistrate Chen and others, it was decided to use three wedge doors made of steel and cement, each with a width of 13 square feet. The old stone materials in the wedge will be used to open a small wedge in front of Sangjia Liangting to store water for irrigation. As for the funding, it will be donated by gentlemen according to the amount of their fields, and the administrative organs will be asked to monitor it strictly.</p>

<p>Starting Tonight</p>
<p>The venerable father of Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Xieyuan, will celebrate his 89th birthday this autumn, and his mother will be 69 years old. Mr. Yuan's relatives and friends originally planned to celebrate the 9th birthday, but the venerable elder, seeing the hardships of the times, and the floods in various provinces, could not bear to speak of longevity and strongly resisted the celebration. Mr. Yuan's relatives and friends, out of consideration for the old man's compassion, used the birthday gifts to help with disaster relief. The Ya Ge Ji Box Office, due to Mr. Yuan's relationship as a director, performed for three days, both to celebrate the birthday of the venerable elder and Yuan's mother, and to express gratitude to the relatives and friends who sent gifts, and to show gratitude to the disaster victims.

<p>Wenhua Villa on Shigaota Road was contracted by the owner, Zhidong Company, to Chen Xinji Construction Factory, and construction began in June of the 19th year. After the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau received the notice from the Public Works Bureau that the water and electricity of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company had not yet arrived, it sent a letter to the owner instructing them to sign a bond before temporarily using water and electricity from foreign water and electricity companies. The owner then submitted a bond for filing. In late August, the Public Utilities Bureau received a request from the Shanghai Waterworks Company to dig roads and requested to dig roads and connect pipes there. For the sake of caution, the construction factory was instructed to sign a bond, stating that "this water is temporarily connected for the construction of houses, and will be removed upon completion of the project." The road digging permit was then forwarded to the Public Works Bureau for approval and construction to connect the water. According to recent reports, the house has been completed for five months, and Zhabei tap water has also arrived, but the water used for construction has not been cut off and is being used to supply residents with drinking water. The water fee is calculated at 7.5% of the rent and collected by the owner when collecting the rent each month, which is a violation of the previous agreement and hinders sovereignty. It is reported that the owner has been ordered to switch to Zhabei tap water before September 10th, and the construction factory has been ordered to remove the installed water pipes within the same deadline, otherwise, they will be severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e185">The Largest Liner in the Pacific Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>To Invite All Sectors to Visit on the 18th</p>
<p>The Fastest and Largest Postal Ship Between China and America</p>
<p>Since last year, British, Japanese, and American shipping companies have been investing heavily and competing to build giant ships to vie for Pacific shipping. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Nippon Yusen Kaisha's newly built large postal ships for the China-America route have already been completed and put into service. The American Dollar Steamship Lines has also specially built two new, powerful, and fast postal ships at a cost of 60 million yuan to add to the Pacific route. The first ship, the President Hoover, has already left the factory and set sail. After this ship sails, it will be the largest ship ever on the China-America line. Its speed, hull, and layout are superior to those of the new British and Japanese ships in every way. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th of this month, at which time all sectors will be invited to visit. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Enormous Ship Body The President Hoover and the President Coolidge, built by Dollar, each have a displacement of 31,000 tons and a cargo capacity of 23,000 tons. The ships are 635 feet long and 81 feet deep, with a total of six decks. They are fully equipped with lounges, dining rooms, swimming pools, gyms, smoking rooms, libraries, and more. The first-class section has 350 rooms, the special-class section has 150 rooms, and the third-class section has 700 rooms. The interior layout is exceptionally beautiful, truly like an Atlantic postal ship. Due to the large number of passengers it can accommodate, the ship is equipped with three chief officers. The ship's speed is 23 knots per hour, with a normal speed of 21 knots per hour. A circumnavigation of the world would only take 85 days.</p>
<p>▲ Visit to Shanghai The President Hoover was completed first and set sail from New York on August 6th. The Shanghai office received a telegram stating that all classes of cabins are fully booked on this maiden voyage to Shanghai. It is currently in the Pacific and will arrive in Japan shortly. It is scheduled to enter the port at 9:00 AM on the 18th of this month and dock at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf. Dollar has specially appointed his second son, Mr. Harold Dollar, to sail on the ship as a supervisor to China. On the day of arrival in Shanghai, from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM, all sectors of Shanghai will be invited to visit the ship. 4,000 invitations have already been sent out. The Dollar's general manager, Mr. Stein, and the Chinese director will be on the ship to receive guests and guide the tour. During the tour, all work will be suspended for three hours.</p>
<p>▲ Delayed Aircraft Installation According to Mr. Dollar's plan, two aircraft were originally planned to be installed on the ship, following the Atlantic model, to pick up and deliver express mail and to transport passengers who were unable to board the ship on time by plane to catch up on the high seas, allowing passengers to save even more time. However, due to various reasons, the installation of this type of seaplane has been temporarily delayed. The ship's cargo holds each have special facilities, such as silk cabins, tea cabins, refrigerated rooms, and bullion vaults, which are very well-equipped. The engine is electric-powered, so the fuel is oil.</p>
<p>▲ Maiden Voyage Schedule The ship is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and Luzon on the 19th, and return to Shanghai on October 2nd. The maiden voyage to the United States will depart from Shanghai. It will take 36 days to reach the United States. The first, second, and third class cabins on the ship are currently fully booked. It is expected that the ship will be full of passengers when it departs from Shanghai. As for the first export cargo loaded on the ship to the United States, even though the market is not good, it can still carry 1,500 tons to the United States. The second new ship, the President Coolidge, which is the same size as the President Hoover, is scheduled to depart from the United States in November and arrive in Shanghai in mid-December. It is said that Mr. Dollar will send his eldest son, Mr. Stanley Dollar, to supervise the voyage when the ship begins its service.</p>

<p>A Passionate Romance Between a Man and a Woman</p>
<p>Marriage Opposed by Parents</p>
<p>Li Junfu Takes His Own Life Because of This</p>
<p>The Police Station Offers Guidance</p>
<p>Li Junfu, a local resident, 19 years old, recently became disheartened due to an unsuccessful marriage proposal and conceived a pessimistic view of life. The day before yesterday, at 11:00 PM, he went alone to the Hankou Road pier, hired sampan No. 1001, and said he wanted to go to Pudong. When the sampan reached the middle of the river, Li jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. Fortunately, the sampan operator, Chen Jinde, immediately used a bamboo pole to hook Li, allowing him to be rescued. He was then sent to the Customs Water Police Station. After the head constable inquired about the reasons for the suicide, Li stated that he worked at Guang Sheng Hong on Nanjing Road. He had met a woman named Hu Caiyun, 17 years old, from Hebei. Through friends, they developed a love relationship, and their passion reached a boiling point. "Because our private affairs cannot be a long-term plan, I discussed with her to ask a matchmaker to propose to her parents. Unexpectedly, many obstacles arose. The other party's parents are old-fashioned and sternly rejected our affair. I was unable to control my anger, and the family moved back to their ancestral home in Hebei. From then on, we are separated by vast distances, and I can only lament my helplessness. Recalling the past, I am in so much pain that I don't want to live," he said. The senior Chinese officer at the police station believed that Li's sacrifice of his young life for a woman and an unsuccessful marriage proposal was a foolish act, so he gave him detailed guidance to prevent him from repeating his mistake. The head constable then sent Detective Wu Rongsheng to escort Li to the upstairs of Chen Quan's Fate Calculation Hall on North Henan Road to be taken in by his brother-in-law, Chen Mingzhou, and severely admonished.</p>

After receiving the telegram, the four-route fortress specially dispatched Chief of Staff Shuai Chongxing and staff member Li Lide to the Song forts yesterday morning to inspect the actual situation. They were received by Commander Deng, and Chief of Staff Teng Wenshou and Adjutant Shen Zitian accompanied them on a week-long inspection of the north and south forts and the Lion Grove Fort.

During this period, in addition to the original variety of entertainment, countless new and special varieties of entertainment will be added. Tickets will still be sold for one yuan, and no donations will be solicited within the venue. However, local factories and businesses will be solicited to donate daily-use domestic goods, regardless of quantity. They should be sent to the show's preparation office before the event. At that time, the show will separately publish advertisements for the products and assign male and female salespersons to sell them at low prices. Alternatively, factories and businesses can contact the preparation office before the event to arrange for personnel to bring their products to the show to set up stalls for sale. No stall rent will be charged. All proceeds from sales will be combined with the ticket sales revenue and used for disaster relief. All income will be overseen by accountants appointed by Mr. Shao Ruxin, the show's manager, at the request of Mr. Wang Xiaolai and Du Yuesheng, who will be stationed at the show to be fully responsible and demonstrate credibility. A temporary preparation office has been set up at the accounting office of the New World Southern Palace Theater at 61 Xizang Road and has already begun operations.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Nan Fengxiang Robbery Case is Solved <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>On March 17th of this year, the Nan Fengxiang Jewelry Store inside the Dadongmen Gate in the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct of the First District of the Nanshi was robbed by bandits of a large quantity of gold jewelry worth several thousand gold pieces, and a box cannon carried by the petitioning police officer at the store was also seized on the spot. After the case occurred, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau repeatedly ordered his subordinates to intensify their efforts to track down the criminals and solve the case as soon as possible. After careful investigation by Captain Lu of the Detective Team, buying information and following leads, it was suddenly reported by team leader Shan Bin that, according to confidential sources, the bandits in this case, Gu Weiliang and others, were hiding in the thatched houses behind the Gongyi Cotton Mill in Caojiadu. Every time after work, the bandits would be near the factory teasing and having fun. He requested instructions on how to proceed. Upon hearing the news, Captain Lu immediately dispatched detectives Ding Shunbao, Wu Zuorong, Zhang Xinlong, Wu Kezhong, Shen Wenda, and Chen Liangfu to disguise themselves and lie in wait, seizing the opportunity to arrest them. It was reported by the officers that on the previous day (the 1st), after receiving instructions, they disguised themselves and went to the vicinity of the Gongyi Factory to lie in wait. At around 6:00 PM, just as the factory was letting out workers, the bandits Gu Weiliang and others were seen strolling idly. They immediately took action without showing any signs and, together with the local police, surrounded and arrested the bandits Gu Weiliang, Jin Xiaosan, and suspect Zhang Haisan on the spot. They were taken to the team, where the captain interrogated them separately. The bandits Gu Weiliang and others all confessed to robbing the Nan Fengxiang Jewelry Store with weapons. They also confessed that an accomplice, Dong Huaibao, was hiding in a house at 22 Bailinan Road. They were ordered to take the criminals back to the house and arrest Dong. After a thorough interrogation, after the truth is known, they will be sent to the Judicial Section for review.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Fire at Xia Yingtang's Home Kills an Old Servant <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Lin Xiangxiang, a 60-year-old sedan chair carrier at the home of Xia Yingtang, a doctor of the time in Dongma Bridge on Fangbang Road in the city, was no longer able to work. Xia, remembering that he was an old servant for decades, provided him with food and accommodation at home. Yesterday at 4:00 AM, Lin was sound asleep when the mosquito incense stick he had lit burned the mosquito net. The fire immediately spread, burning the bedding. The room was filled with thick smoke, and Lin was choked unconscious by the smoke. The fire burned his skin and flesh, and he did not know which way to escape. He curled up in bed and died tragically. However, the family members had already heard the alarm and got up to put out the fire, so the house was not damaged in the slightest. Only Lin Xiangxiang was burned to death. After the incident, the Second Precinct of the First District investigated the facts and ordered a certain Hua Dechang in the Eighth Ward to report to the local court. Prosecutor Yang and others were commissioned to go to the scene to verify the facts and ordered the body to be collected for burial.</p>

<p>Abduction Case on the Fengtian Steamer</p>
<p>Investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang of the Relief Association, together with Detective Bao Huang Songsheng of the Water Police Station, investigated an abduction case on the Taikoo Company's Fengtian steamer yesterday. They saw a young girl who was acting restless. The officers immediately questioned her. She claimed to be Wu Lanying, 16 years old, from Wuxi, living at 33 Sanxing Lane, Baxianqiao. This time, she was going to her aunt's house in Yantai with her brother. When asked about her aunt's name, she was at a loss. While they were questioning her, the so-called brother came to interfere. Unexpectedly, his accent was from Shandong. The officers were even more suspicious and questioned him. If they were siblings, why were their accents different? He claimed that the girl was born to his father's concubine. When asked where they came from, he said Nanjing, contradicting himself. The officers suddenly asked the man's name, and he said Yang Pinshan. When asked why their names were different if they were siblings, and what their parents' names were, the man said he didn't know. The officers thought it unheard of for children not to know their father's name, and arrested them together and took them to the Water Police Station for questioning. It turned out that they had abducted her from Zhujiaqiao, concocted a story, and taken her to another port. After recording the confession, the head constable transferred the group to the local court, where the prosecutor investigated and ordered Yang Pinshan to be detained and the girl to be sent to the association for safekeeping.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Police Department Does Not Recognize Private Detectives <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Considers Them Illegal Organizations</p>
<p>Phone Company Theft</p>
<p>Private Detective Investigates</p>
<p>Resulting in Conviction</p>
<p>The China-Foreign Telephone Company on Fujian Road recently suffered repeated thefts of large quantities of telephone wires, which could not be investigated. The company commissioned Clarke's Detective Agency at 36 Renji Road to investigate on their behalf. Clarke is a British man who previously served as Deputy Inspector-General in the Public Concession's Public Works Department. After resigning due to an incident a few years ago, he founded a private detective agency. Now that Clarke has accepted the commission from the telephone company, he ordered his employee, Jin Meisheng from Suzhou, to handle the matter. Jin secretly investigated everywhere. He met the telephone company workers Ji Zhengda, Peng Caoxue, and Zheng Caohai at the Yong'an Company's rooftop garden. Jin lured them with words, claiming that he wanted to buy telephone wires. The workers, not knowing that Jin was a private detective, agreed. The next day, they secretly obtained 70 yuan worth of telephone wires from the company and sold them to Jin for profit. Jin immediately reported the information to the telephone company, which in turn reported it to the Laozha Police Station. The station dispatched detectives to arrest the three workers and sent them to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, Ji and others were sentenced to six months' imprisonment for embezzlement, with a three-year suspended sentence due to their first offense. However, after this case occurred, the police department considered Jin Meisheng's actions to be inappropriate and suspected him of violating Article 165 of the Criminal Law for obstructing order and Article 376 for receiving stolen goods. Therefore, they filed a lawsuit against Jin and sent him to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday morning, where Chief Judge Zhou Hanting presided over the hearing. Clarke also attended the hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Bao, stated the above situation, saying that according to the defendant's confession to the police, he was working as an assistant at Clarke's private detective agency. The term "private detective" is, in name, no different from a police detective. According to the regulations of the Yangjingbang, private detectives have no basis. Moreover, in the Public Concession, no police agency other than the Public Works Department can exercise police powers. Therefore, the Public Works Department absolutely denies the private detective agency and believes that it has no right to exercise its duties. Now that the defendant has exercised his duties and exercised the powers of a public official, he has violated Article 165 of the Criminal Law for obstructing order and is suspected of receiving stolen goods. Therefore, he is being prosecuted. Subsequently, the telephone company's engineer, the British man Webb, filed a complaint about the theft of telephone wires. The telephone company's representative, the British man Wilson, also filed a report stating that because of repeated thefts of telephone wires, they commissioned Clarke's private detective to investigate. Chief Judge Zhou declared to the representative that if there is a theft in the concession, it must be reported to the police station. It is inappropriate for you to abandon the police station and commission a private detective. Have you investigated whether the private detective is legal? The representative replied that he had not investigated. When asked, the defendant Jin Meisheng stated that he was ordered to go out and buy telephone wires and reported it to the telephone company, and there was nothing else. Chief Judge Zhou reviewed the confession and, considering that the private detective agency was an illegal organization and could not arbitrarily exercise its powers, sentenced the defendant Jin Meisheng in court to a fine of 150 yuan for illegally exercising the powers of a public official. If he was unable to pay the fine, he would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed would be used to offset the fine, with one day offsetting one yuan.</p>

Now, the various girls' groups have begun working, and the various tutoring classes are scheduled to open on September 7th. This season, Ms. Li Wang Shuming has been invited to take charge of the association's education department in an effort to expand it. Ms. Li Wang has a master's degree from the University of Michigan in the United States and has taught at the Tianjin Zhongxi Girls' School. She has a wealth of knowledge. Ms. Yang Qingxin, a graduate of Ginling College who has taught for many years, has also been invited to be the association's membership department director. Ms. Eckert will assist with the girls' department work, and Ms. Haner will preside over the foreign branch affairs, replacing Pei Chaxiang, who has returned to the United States for rest. It is expected that the association's affairs will flourish. In order to study the association's purpose and whether its work is suitable for the needs of modern society, to determine the future direction of the work, and to study what responsibilities those who serve in the association should prioritize, the association's directors have specifically scheduled a two-day retreat at Mr. Huang Bohui's garden in Nanxiang on September 4th and 5th.

<h3 id="e195">Assassination of a Cotton Mill Inspector <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Criminals Arrested</p>
<p>Zhao Xilin, a Changzhou native who was an inspector at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill in Yangjiapu, was shot and wounded by his enemies at the gate of the factory at 6:00 AM on the 20th of last month. Stray bullets also hit Li Litang and Zhang Wenjin, who died from their injuries. Subsequently, the Yangshupu Police Station arrested two suspects, Qian Afu and Qiang Ruxing, both from Wuxi, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. It was reported in this newspaper. At noon the day before yesterday, Hua Tanmu Shan Zhaoxian and Pang Ruiqing, who were handling the case, arrested Yan Jinlong from Yangzhou and Han Cao, a woman from Changzhou, at 1435 Yongjili, Xinzha Road, and took them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court. According to the police lawyer Zhang Tiansa, the murderer in the case, named Xiao Changzhou, is at large. The address at 1435 Yongjili, Xinzha Road, is where the criminal lives. Therefore, the police station sent detectives to wait near the house. The two defendants arrived one after another yesterday and were arrested. However, Han Cao is Xiao Changzhou's mistress. Please interrogate. Detectives Shan and Gong then reported the situation again and questioned Yan Jinlong. He stammered and denied knowing Xiao Changzhou and did not recognize Zhao Xilin. When asked, Han Cao admitted to knowing Xiao Changzhou and said that he had some grudges with Zhao Xilin. Although she was present when others shot him, she did not do anything. Yesterday, Yan Jinlong invited her to her house to pawn her clothes to get money for him to use to avoid trouble. Therefore, she was arrested by the police detectives. She did not know anything else. Please judge. Judge Xiao Xiefen reviewed the confession and ordered them to be returned to custody separately and interrogated again at a later date.</p>

At 7:30 PM the night before last, Qu was riding a bicycle No. 390 home from Xujiahui when a car No. 8777, driven by a French national named Robot, who lived at 202 Xiahui Road, turned from Daxi Road and headed south into Columbia Road, hitting Qu and his bicycle. Qu was knocked to the ground, his head was broken and bleeding, and he lost consciousness. The front wheel of the bicycle was also smashed. The Daxi Road branch of the Second Precinct of the Sixth District was nearby. The police officer, upon learning of the situation, immediately sent Sergeant Wu Dazhao to take the injured Qu Ronglong to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. He also took the French national Robot, who caused the accident, and the car No. 8777 back to the station. After a brief interrogation by Director Liu, he prepared a document and sent it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau overnight for investigation. However, Qu's skull was shattered and he lost too much blood. He died in the hospital yesterday evening.</p>

<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Youren's Letter</p>
<p>I felt great pain in my early childhood learning. I intend to study Chinese in my spare time, but because I am bound by store regulations, I can only study by correspondence. There are very few correspondence schools in Shanghai that I know of, so I have written this letter specifically requesting your newspaper to recommend one or two places with real scholars for me to choose from.</p>
<p>(Reply) The Chinese Correspondence Department of the Commercial Press is divided into three levels: elementary, middle, and high school. You can directly request the regulations from the Press. In addition, the Chinese Vocational Education Society on Huanlong Road has a correspondence school with full-time teachers who use communication methods to guide learning, and you can also go there for face-to-face guidance at any time. If you are interested, you can also request a copy of the regulations for your perusal.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Yin's Letter</p>
<p>I remember that around August 20th, your newspaper published several current commentaries on basic educational issues, discussing the difficulty students have in accessing educational opportunities, which is quite pitiful. I am one of those rejected by those dignified headmasters because I don't have tuition fees. However, even if I did, to be honest, I would not want to study in the current mechanical, commercialized schools that only care about teaching and not about the needs of the students. Therefore, I have decided on my future direction, which is to study on my own for two years and then seek employment. But what books should I study on my own during these two years? Please answer me one by one in the newspaper (I studied in high school for one year), because I imagine there must be many people who sympathize with me, and it will certainly not be a waste of your considerable energy, time, and the precious space of the Shen Bao, just for one person. Can you accept my request?</p>
<p>(Reply) Young people who have studied to the high school level must determine their future career direction, so that what they learn is more relevant and useful. Since you have studied in high school for one year and want to study on your own for two years, it is best to understand your own nature, talent, interests, and environment, and decide what kind of occupation you will pursue in the future. Then, when you study on your own, prepare to learn the knowledge and skills related to preparing for that occupation. Since the letter states (no tuition fees), it is not necessary to study on your own for two years. Why not seek employment early? If you are interested in supplementary schools, you should quickly prepare for a career or find a way to enter a vocational supplementary school. If you get a job, accumulate some surplus funds after a few years, and then pursue higher education, wouldn't that be taking care of both sides? Because I do not know the direction of your employment and study at this time, it is difficult to suggest a list of self-study books. Please understand.</p>

<p>People are always happy when children are born white and fat. If they are born a little thin or dark, parents or friends will show them less affection. Most people probably have this kind of mentality to some extent. People who know a little about eugenics even arbitrarily judge the quality of seeds based on the size and strength of the body. This is wrong. People are not pigs, so how can you determine superiority based on fat and thin? The average Chinese child weighs about eight or nine pounds at birth. Recently, two of our friends had a child who weighed only six pounds. I was afraid that they would be affected by general opinions, or that they would discriminate against their little baby, so I wrote a letter congratulating them, saying:</p>
<p>(......I heard that you had a six-pound baby and I am very happy. For nearly 250 years, the authority who led natural science, Sir Isaac Newton, weighed only three pounds at birth. Your little baby is twice the size of Newton, and his contribution to mankind will also be twice as much. ......)</p>
<p>When Newton was born, everyone thought he would not survive. The two midwives who were sent to call the doctor. As they walked, they complained: (It's really stupid for us to rush like this! It would be a miracle if he could live until we get home. Such a little mouse, he will always not survive, we will run our legs swollen, and we won't get a thank you. Sister, we have no way to do this job. Heaven chose us to do this, so we have to hurry. Thank goodness, it's easy to eat to get there.) Contrary to the midwife's expectations, Newton lived, and lived to eighty-five years old. (Born in 1642, died in 1727)</p>
<h3 id="e205">Jiang Dengxuan <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zhezun</p>
<p>Jiang Dengxuan's courtesy name was Chaoliu. He was the son of Jiang Guiti, the commander of the Yi Army. Guiti only knew a few characters. One day, he passed through the market and saw the words "Mobil Oil" plastered everywhere on the walls. Guiti said to those around him, "There are quite a few people with the surname Jiang here." He had mistakenly recognized the word "Mei" (美) as the character "Jiang" (姜). Those around him dared not laugh, but only agreed. Chaoliu was intelligent as a child. Because his father had not studied, he was quite fond of learning. He was also able to compose poetry. After entering the military, he had the style of a learned general. After the war in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Qi Fu, the governor, went to Japan. Zhang Zongchang, Lu Zijia, and Yang Linge successively came to Jiangsu. Chaoliu was then appointed by the Feng faction as the Commander-in-Chief for Suppressing Bandits in the Four Provinces. Later, he became the Commander-in-Chief of Anhui Province. Before long, Guo Songling turned against Feng. Sun Xinyuan also led troops from Zhejiang to Jiangsu. Chaoliu had no choice but to take his troops back to Feng. On the way, he met with Guo, intending to dissuade him out of friendship. Unexpectedly, he was surrounded and killed by Guo's troops. The knife wounds were terrible. Guo was soon defeated by Zou Zuohua, the artillery brigade commander of his own troops, who turned against him. He and his wife fled secretly and were captured and executed by shooting. Chaoliu later descended to a spirit altar four times. He left many judgments. The last one was a regulated verse. The poem said: "It is sad to lose one's life in troubled times. Do not suspect each other of kindness and resentment. The overwhelming injustice is sung like a cry. The ghostly soul enters the earth and comes again. Wild flowers on the desolate tomb are born from the blood of the deceased. The snow phantom on the horizontal mountain is the ash of the catastrophe. The white bones of a stranger have been detained for many years. Who will pour a cup towards the Yellow Springs?" After the judgment, he was about to leave and said again, "Wearing armor, I will not bow. Farewell, mournfully." It is conceivable that he was refined and different. The meaning of the poem is sad and unbearable to read. I think that the calamity is difficult to escape, and it is the same in ancient and modern times. No matter what kind of person they are in the world, if they are born in troubled times, they are probably here to complete this calamity. Infighting continues. Revenge follows each other. Changeable and impermanent. Arguing endlessly. In the end, both sides are hurt. Alas, how sad!</p>

<p>The late King Edward loved flowers very much. And what he loved most was the carnation (Shanghai flower sellers call it "Kang Na Sheng"). Although carnations are not very fragrant, they have several colors. The form of the flowers is also exquisite and lovely. What the king especially loved was a white carnation, called "Whitepearl".</p>
<p>▲ Sunbathing as Fashion European and American women's favorite fashions are often whimsical and change at any time. The most recent trend is sunbathing as fashion. In seaside social scenes, you can often hear a woman praising another woman: (I don't know where she got this soft sun-kissed color.) Therefore, the fashionable women on the beach and tennis court this summer often have bare, sun-tanned yellow legs. If they are not sun-tanned, they are specially dyed with a tan color. This color is said to be made into creams and pastes. On the one hand, it is trendy, and on the other hand, it is economical. Because a pair of long or short stockings can be saved.</p>

<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The form of human beings is bizarre and strange, and there is nothing strange about it. In Paris, the capital of France, there is a Minotaur. A strange thing, too. A human body with a bull's head can speak to people. Last time at the exhibition of strange people, all the visitors were amazed when they saw it. Even the famous bearded women of Europe and America could not compete with it. Recently, this Minotaur suddenly died. He left behind a property of 14,000 pounds.</p>
<p>When the Minotaur was alive, he went to various places to perform. Those who wanted to see this strange person had to pay a fee of six cents to enter. However, the Minotaur's property was not accumulated from ticket sales. It was because he had invented things in mechanics and obtained patent money. He was in the United States at that time. He had already moved to the United States. He soon married and had a daughter.</p>
<p>After the Minotaur got married, he soon felt disgusted with his family and suffered from homesickness. One morning, he took all his belongings and left. His wife and daughter did not hear from him. After the Minotaur left the United States, he returned to his hometown in France. He soon lived with a woman and had two daughters. When he died two years ago, he left his property to his mother and daughter.</p>
<p>The Minotaur suddenly disappeared in the United States, and people in the society were surprised. However, his eldest daughter did not avoid hardship, traveled long distances, and crossed the Atlantic Ocean to collect all the information about her father's life. She applied to the court for a division of property. According to French law, the eldest daughter has the right to divide the property. She can get at least half of the 14,000 pounds, it is said.</p>

<p>Gu Dingmei Sang Wildly at the Banquet Gu Xiegui, courtesy name Dingmei, was a famous scholar in Jiangnan. He traveled to Shaanxi and Gansu in the past and had literary exchanges with my father. Later, he returned south to preside over the Scientific Instrument Museum. My father also lived in Shanghai, so they often visited each other. He was a forthright and unceremonious man. Here is a story he told to help the conversation along. One day, my father gathered friends for a banquet at the Wanzhao Building. Wang Yiting, Di Pingzi, Xiang Songmao, Li Zuhan, and Qiu Jun and his sister were among the guests. He was also there. After drinking for a while, he suddenly became very interested in singing. He sang the Kunqu opera "Thinking of Mortal World" wildly in the middle of the banquet. Although there was no tune or rhythm, his voice was loud and shook the roof tiles. The whole table laughed, and Mr. Yiting especially held his stomach and couldn't stop laughing.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Danweng's One-Character Letter Danweng's real name was Danfu. Danweng was his pen name. He was famous in society for his good at writing strange articles and characters. He once worked for the late General Lu Langzhai, planning strategies and traveling to Chang'an together. Therefore, he was familiar with my father. When I traveled south to study, I often visited his residence during my spare time to ask for advice, and he also often invited me to talk. Therefore, there are many letters from him in my suitcase. The most peculiar thing was that he wrote a letter in a hurry, with only the word "Lai" (來, "come"). It was not addressed or signed. However, I could recognize it as his letter of invitation by the handwriting. So this simple letter was far better than a telegram.</p>
<p>▲ Liu Gonglu's Amazing Long Braid Liu Gonglu of Guichi had a family history of scholarship and was talented at a young age. He had a fondness for braids, so people called him the "Remnant Youth" (遺少) to distinguish him from the "Remnant Elders" (遺老). I once visited his residence and saw the calligraphy and paintings hanging on the wall with the inscription "Xuantong 78th year", so the Remnant Youth was indeed worthy of the name. Gonglu lived in the foreign concession, so he kept his long braid, and was spared the haircut of Bingzhou. However, whenever he dragged his braid through the city, people who saw him were curious and pointed and talked. He was not embarrassed at all. I remember once going with him to the municipal hall to watch a play. When the show ended, a voice suddenly rang out in the crowd: (Where did the Braid Master come from?) All the audience's attention was focused on him. He walked out of the crowd without taking offense. Now he has moved to Suzhou. I once asked a friend to visit him, and his braid was deeply hidden under his hat, not like it was in Shanghai, where it hung down behind his head and swaggered through the market.</p>
<h3 id="e209">A New Medical View of Treating Burns with Tea <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yebai</p>
<p>Burns are caused by the body coming into contact with fire, powder, steam, boiling soup, and high-temperature solids. They are most commonly encountered in daily life. The symptoms are divided into three levels. The first level is redness, swelling, and pain. The second level is blisters. The third level is tissue carbonization and loss. The drugs to treat it are nothing more than medicinal powders, ointments, pastes, and paraffin agents that have bactericidal, anti-inflammatory, and protective properties. These are all commonly used by Western medicine.</p>
<p>In 1924, an American named Daris discovered a toxin in the secretions of burn tissue. The bad phenomena of burns are all caused by this toxin. This toxin coagulates into a scab when it encounters tannic acid and no longer has a toxic effect. The person then used 5% tannic acid water as a dressing for burns and obtained the best treatment results. Since then, various places have followed suit and have achieved definite results. It is truly a new progress in burn therapy.</p>
<p>When I lived in the countryside of Guizhou in the past, it was hundreds of miles away, and there was no trace of Western medicine. After the villagers were burned, they chewed tea leaves and applied them to the injured area. If it dried, they would apply more until it scabbed over and healed. The elders passed it down and it was repeatedly tested and proven. When asked about the reason from Chinese medicine, they replied with a general term of "reducing fire and disinfecting", not knowing that tea leaves contain tannic acid. The method of applying tea is actually consistent with Dsris's theory. However, chewing tea inevitably contains toxic bacteria in the mouth, so it is better to use boiling water to brew strong tea and soak it in sterilized cotton to apply it. (Ordinary cotton can be used after steaming or boiling) It is a pity that our people do not know how to research, knowing that it is so but not knowing why. It is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>There are many effective Chinese prescriptions for treating diseases. Unfortunately, those who practice them often keep them secret and deceive people with strange and mysterious words. It is distorted and miscommunicated, and gradually becomes obscure. If it can be made public for precise scientific research, perhaps many medical doctors can be produced, and there can also be a considerable contribution to the world's medical community.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Qingyun Cloister and Bada Shanren (Part 1) <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>In the summer of Xinwei, I visited Nanchang and heard that there was a Taoist temple called Qingyun Cloister fifteen miles southeast of the city, which was known as a scenic spot. During my leisure time, I drove there with my old friend Song Fengzi. After leaving the city, we followed the Nanchang Road. The flat fields were boundless, and the sound of threshing rice and scolding plows could be heard everywhere. It was the busy time for the first crop of farming, and the second crop was about to start. Since Ganzhou south of Fuzhou has been ravaged by the Red disaster, the cities and hills are often ruins, and no cattle or sheep can be seen in the mountains and fields for thousands of miles. Compared with this, what is the happiness and suffering of the people? Before long, we arrived at the gate. The green grass was flat and clear, and the tall wutong trees covered the eaves like a canopy. The scenery was cool. The Taoist priest Han Cuiting greeted us with great diligence. The cloister covers an area of more than ten acres and is located in the wilderness as a marshland. There are three rows of houses, a total of more than thirty rooms. The front row enshrines the statue of Guan Yu, and the system is firm and simple, like the work of the Ming Dynasty. The middle and rear rows enshrine Taoist statues. The rooms along the corridor on the left and right are Dan rooms, which are clean and spacious. It is said that they were built by the former Taoist leader Yunyan. Outside the house, there are bamboo trees and shrubs in the gaps. Water is drawn into a pond in the sunken area, and water chestnuts and lotus are planted. A plank bridge and winding paths are built to connect. The path snakes through the bamboo trees. When you are in the middle of it, a pavilion is built with wood, where you can climb up and look around. The mixed flowers and secluded birds are the opposite of what you see and hear up and down. The planning and construction of the cloister was not grand, but the arrangement was subtle, as if there was Tao in it. The customs of Jiangxi respect Taoism. The Youlong School has been spreading until now without changing. Other people do not know how to cherish it. I have not heard of Buddhist palaces. Ruziting has become a place for refugees. The Tengwang Pavilion has also been abandoned as a water management office. Those in the capital who love antiquity and seek seclusion have nowhere to set foot. Therefore, the Qingyun Taoist temple has gradually seen carriages, officials, staffs and shoes. After browsing around, we had tea under the Doumu Pavilion. The Taoist showed us the collection of Bada Shanren's calligraphy and paintings. There was only a square inch of calligraphy, running script. The painting was an axis of ancient trees and mockingbirds, ink and wash, paper. The brush and ink were not similar. It was judged to be Ying Ding. After that, the statues of the refined teacher Liangyue and Ma Quanzhen were shown. The statue of Liangyue is wearing a Taoist robe and a Confucian crown, sitting cross-legged on a Dan Cliff and green water with his eyes closed. The appearance is solemn and quiet. Taoist Wang Zehong of the Three Swords attached a eulogy to it, saying: He abandoned his family for Tian Shen to enter the sea. He boasted of Tao for his body to find fragrant beads. Taoist robe and Confucian crown, the dignity is still there. Dan Cliff and green water, what is the difference in scenery. Some think that Wang Sun is on a fork road, and some think that the universe is a rotten Confucian. Listening to the wind, I suspect that it is He Jing. Looking at the plum blossoms, it is very similar to Lin Bu. White clouds are always in the void, who can tie them down. Lingzhi is produced on the side of the cliff, and it is difficult to find a species. I don't know where Tao begins, and I don't know where Tao ends. Those who have no beginning and no end are where Tao is. Those who have no Tao in Tao are the sect of Tao. Ma Xiang had glaring eyes and a Xiu beard, bare-bellied and barefoot, sitting upright on a dangerous cliff. The shape was very tall. A crane hovered above its head. The brushstrokes of the painting are also good. There is the interest of emerging from the water and facing the wind. It is the hand of Huang Bi. San Yuan Old Man inscribed it: "A misty immortal guards the house. The altar has been prospering for thousands of years. The footsteps are like the Taoist flow. The tripod room is shining with elixir. Who is Master Ma? Where does he come from? The shore is a tall and burly figure. The silver beard is over the belly. The arms and feet are surrounded by copper rings. The divine power cannot be restrained. The chest and abdomen are proud of all kinds of monsters. Dragons, tigers, turtles and snakes are hidden. The drooping knot is so abundant. The interpretation is close to the subtle. Wonderful enlightenment reveals heaven and man. The source leads to its outline. Yang Xin's gray body. The cloud characters are shining with light. Auspicious clouds linger. The crane is not winged. The public sees and exclaims. The legends are mutually low and high. The supreme Tao still is natural. Refining the nature and frustrating the sharpness. Changes boast of the last road. Slander is everywhere. Spiritual traces shine on the earth. Occasionally hidden by the ear. Silently explore the Xuanmiao Gate. The feeling is to take the bag." Silently facing it for a long time, I lingered and could not bear to let go. The Taoist said: "The refined teacher Liangyue is the Bada Shanren. Shanren was formerly a descendant of the Ming Ning clan, named Zhu Da. After the Jia Shen change, he and his brother, whose Taoist name was Poyunzi, and his friend Ma Quanzhen, all entered Taiyi Temple as Taoist priests. They changed the name of the temple to Qingyun Cloister. Therefore, Shanren really created the Qingyun Cloister in Ganzhou at the beginning.</p>

<h3 id="e211">A Husband's Wife (3) <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>She not only wanted to maintain her own personal happiness, but also sincerely wanted to preserve her husband's permanent happiness. Their marriage had not been established for long, although it was not entirely a free love, but was promoted by the half-new and old-fashioned parents' orders and matchmaker's methods, but before the marriage, neither of them was dissatisfied; especially her, she really loved her husband very deeply. When she was first married, she was very satisfied. She felt that he was a very honest young man, without any vanity or arrogance. He worked very diligently, did not love extravagance, and was very gentle to his wife. His profession was to be in constant contact with women, but apart from the time when he had to be close to women for his profession, he never hid anything from his wife, or went to hang out or talk to any woman behind his wife's back. So she trusted him very much and loved him especially. But sometimes she felt slightly that her husband was too restrained, not the attitude that a young man should have. She had many female classmates, who were very lively and beautiful. She often invited them to her house to play, to let him meet them, to talk casually, or to go on an outing, or to go to the movies together. She felt that her husband's life was too monotonous, and she wanted to use this method to make her husband's life not so boring. Sometimes she was very busy with housework, so she often asked her girlfriends to accompany her husband out to play, but Mr. Li refused at least seven or eight times out of ten. Occasionally, he agreed, but he came back alone very hastily. She was even more convinced that her husband was not worth his attention and sympathy with any woman other than his wife.</p>
<p>Unfortunately! The change in things was so rapid, of course, beyond her expectations. A calm lake will have a strong wind blowing up big waves. Her closest friend was Mrs. Chen, so she asked Mrs. Chen to tell Mr. Chen to investigate her husband's recent whereabouts and report to her secretly. Of course, Mrs. Chen agreed to do her best to help her, so that she would not be disappointed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chen was three years younger than Mrs. Li, but her experience and skills were several times greater than Mrs. Li's, so she had already thoroughly understood Mr. Li's current attitude, and she also understood the shortcomings of Mrs. Li's usual treatment of Mr. Li, but she was unwilling to tell these things to Mrs. Li, although they were very close friends. She felt that everything between husband and wife, no outsiders can participate in the judgment or point out the right and wrong, so she did not advise Mr. Chen to do his best to help Mrs. Li; instead, she warned Mr. Chen not to interfere in other people's affairs.</p>

The manager of the factory, Mr. Yue Junchi, requested the grades to comment on the products. They all said that the goods were of good quality, exquisitely manufactured, with novel styles, and reasonably priced. They are really better than imported goods. At this time when we are advocating domestic products and resisting imported goods, all the grades are willing to do their best to promote sales. During the banquet, the factory gave each guest a pair of gloves as a souvenir. The guests and hosts had a good time, and they left at ten o'clock, etc.</p>
