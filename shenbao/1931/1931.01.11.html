<p>編者的話</p>
<p>小別了幾天。又來與讀者諸君相見了。在別的人看來。以爲我們這種剪刀漿糊與紅筆的生活。很爲舒服編輯一種讀物。就有種種的麻煩。種種的苦痛。一方面既要討好讀者一方面又要討好投稿者。正如柔弱的媳婦承歡在翁姑的膝前。頗有啼笑皆非之苦。這種況味。倘不主編一二種刋物。是决不會知道的。今天是民國二十年歲首重與讀者相見之始。不得不先向投稿者說幾句忠實的話　　本刋的態度向來是公開的。只要是合於讀者口胃的良好作品。無不竭誠的歡迎。不過有幾點很關重要。須請大家注意㈠字數不得過六百字。超過了此數。難免割愛。㈡每一稿上必須加蓋國章丶以便領酬時由會計處核對照給。却酬者不在此例㈢稿件務以新頴雋永爲主。勿談迷信。勿說廢話。㈣近來各種集會與婚喪典禮太多了丶實在記不勝記。非極關重要的。請投稿諸君切勿記述惠寄。徒費筆墨。㈤短篇小說及應酬性質的詩文之類。請勿惠賜。海外記遊之作。也因目前已有數種特約之稿。不收外稿。</p>
<p>以上諸點。務請投稿諸君隨時信守。不要觀爲具文。一會兒又忘懐了。</p>
<h3>辛未新辭源</h3>
<p>梅花館主</p>
<p>今年干支爲辛未。未屬羊。因考羊典。　羊盤此爲滬諺。意謂用錢不得其當也。今則皆改羊盤爲﹁大菜盆子﹂矣。</p>
<p>羊氣梨園習語。意謂工夫不到。身上缺少戲的成分也。現滬人廣大其義。凡做事不內行者。輒呼之曰羊氣十足。</p>
<p>羊毛亦梨園習語。其義與半氣略同。然大部分係含﹁不好﹂之意。伶人稱某某藝術不精者。輒曰羊毛。與該行中﹁韭菜﹂二字之意最相　合。</p>

<h3>新裝五年來之一回顧</h3>
<p>— 李寓一</p>
<p>五年前聯育社之時裝表演。虞澹涵孫靜詒談玲君三女士爲其翹楚。風氣初傳。時有神化之譽。其時所謂裝之新者。於披肩外丶類多窮盡於馬甲之式樣。新裝公司之服務。亦不外於些。畫家江小鶼·張辰伯諸子·均捨身其中。不惜承歡裙下。雲裳公司。以是而彰著。諸女士之披肩。類右鐘形。表演時以手抱裏之。令腰部緊凑。則似印婦之裏巾而行。亦能略示體格之美。然試垂手而立。則又如衛生部之大蠅模型。殊不雅觀也。獨有唐瑛女士者。短裳及膝。狹袖　討。不似一般。而號爲最新。綜其時之新裝。有一特徵。即袖短而衣長。仍不失長裙曳地之風也。</p>
<p>自此以後。則日趨於短衣細腰之一途。從着之者之側面視之。則秀姿露骨。益顯弱不禁風。間亦有長者。則長袖長衣別於短袖短衣之式。但皆打破以前之上衣下裙制而純着衫子。</p>
<p>此衫子（即俗名旗袍）之變化。亦有綫索可尋。初能毅然打破三百年來之裙制者。現已影息之黎明暉女士。創着旗袍馬甲以代裙。旗袍馬甲一時爲小兒女之風尙。然馬甲之意。或爲甲胄之遺式。其後婢女着之。以便操作。着月白色馬甲之姨娘大姊。吾人至今猶可想見其風致。通常之短馬甲。端莊婦女恥着之。不意其時由短而長。反增嫵媚。至於今年。又由長而短。且散其對襟丶敞開如男子之西裝。更足以示勤於工作。落拓不覊之姿態。</p>
<p>於此中可以觀察而得之兩相反趨勢。即衫子之式樣在最初爲長。旋於短尙。近則復反於長。馬甲之式樣。則初以短尙</p>
<h3>家甜蜜的家</h3>
<p>天虛我生</p>
<p>一我們雖則在繁華的快樂宮中來頑耍。任憑怎樣優待着。到底不及我的家。那邊有一種眞美化。却是天公賜與咱。我是找遍了天底下。沒有一處兒像我家。家。甜甜蜜蜜甜蜜的家。沒有一處兒像我的家。沒一處兒像我的家。</p>
<p>㈡我呵。踏着荒野望着那月華　。覺得我的媽媽。正在那邊兒想着咱。他是倚着門兒外望穿了一叢冬青花。可惜花兒的香氣味。我就聞不到他。家。甜甜蜜蜜甜蜜的家。我是找遍了天底下。沒一處兒像我的家。</p>
<p>㈢自從遠離離了家。那一切光榮盡虛假。重行給我住到那個低低的草舍兒裏去罷。那些鳥兒歌唱着。答應了我的請求話。我的心中安慰煞。比着那一切都名貴哪。家。甜甜蜜蜜甜蜜的家。可惜我在天一涯。沒有一處兒像我的家。</p>

<h3>紀法人銷燬安南之銀幣</h3>
<p>潔廬</p>
<p>歐人大亡人國家也。莫不先以經濟之侵略。若印度之亡於英之東印度公司。安南之亡於紅河航行權。埃及之亡於外債。待一旦經濟破產。國乃隨之而亡焉。譬如人藉精血以生。就日鹽其精。而吮其血。樅彊如賁育。壯似巨無霸。亦未有不斃者也。溯自歐戰以還。世界各弱小民旋。罔不蠢然欲動。如最近印度甘地創無抵抗主義。其勢尤不可犯。法人　焉憂之。遂欲制越人之死命。使萬刧而不能復。此鎔銷安南銀幣之所由作乎。外灘某銀行者。中法所合辦者也。去秋由法政府蒐聚安南銀幣五千萬元。托該銀行運滬鎔銷。先以機毀之。蓋恐華人及安南富商紛紛出高價購進也。事爲海上銀爐業所聞。羣起兜攬。卒以價格不合而止。該行乃自設銀爐以熔之。今年春。始令各爐分任其事。熔鑄元寳。以應需要。唯各爐利極微薄。約在三四釐之譜。此事海上大小報紙。至今未見登載。愚以爲法人用心之狡。欲使越南遍地紙幣。毫無現金。縱欲有爲。徒喚負負而已。其事不翅秦皇之燬兵器。然則我國今日外貨充牣。紙幣盛行。其危險何忍言耶。</p>

<p>（九十三）</p>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>㈠羅馬十日㈩㈥</p>
<p>六月四日丨大伽藍聖彼得丨梵諦剛敎皇宮丨西施庭敎堂丨</p>
<p>在中央二層樓的有一室內。藏着最著名的雲斑大石棺。全部異常優起。把緊張的肉體。苦悶的表情。生生地雕了出來。據所說係二世紀馬克亞勞ＮａｒｃＡｗｒｅｌｅ大帝的棺。或謂係君士坦丁大帝母后的石棺。現在我不暇去詳考。左面又有一個大石棺係四世紀的遺物。是君士坦丁帝的愛女君士坦齋Ｃｏｎｓｔａｎｚａ的棺。其大體可說是受了希臘石棺的影響。更進一門。是石像室。陳列許多羅馬時代的石像。這許多石像據說是在帝伐利Ｔｉｖｏｌｉ地方所發掘的。如其將這些羅馬時代的石像與希臘的肖像雕刻比較起來。立刻可以看出種種不同之點。羅馬時代的肖像雕刻雖缺少像希臘末期作品那樣的豐富而典麗之美的表現。然以肖像雕刻而論。可以說是盡了謹飭精到的的能事。其寫實描寫。和敏銳的印象表現。在雕刻史上是含有重大的意義的。羅馬的貴族有崇拜祖先的習慣。歡喜在住宅內安置祖先的胸像。這種習慣是誘起肖像雕刻發達的原因。還有多數的石柱。那是移自海特倫別墅中Ｈａｄｒｉａｎ　Ｖｉｌｌａ的。</p>
<p>又走進一室。在中央陳列着一個大理石雕成的立像。這就是羅馬帝國第一代皇帝奧大維Ｏｔｔａｖｉａｎｏ　Ａｕｇｕｓｔｓ的像。胸部甲胄上滿綴着細緻的浮彫。右手指着和雙目睨視着遠征的地方。顯出嚴峻的英偉之資。其威儀之雄毅。使人幾難久視。這無疑地是當時一大傑作。埀爲後世美術史家批判鑒賞的珍品。同時。又是羅馬帝國威震四方的象徵。我在這大理石像下低徊徜徉。瞻仰大帝石啄的遺容。禁不住起了一陣思古幽情呢。</p>
<p>這大帝是凱撒的侄兒。繼續凱撤的遺志。在十五年中消滅了內亂。將羅馬帝國統一起來。植了羅馬二百年和平之基。又征服埃及。張展了羅馬在世界上的版圖。西至大西洋。南至撤哈拉Ｓａｈａｒａ大沙漠。北至多腦河萊因河畔。建立亞歷山大帝以來未有的大帝國丶他秉了四十餘年的大權丶改造了羅馬城。建築了破天荒的大宮殿。給予建築史上一大革命。其偉大動業反映出羅馬席國在歷史上不滅的偉蹟。所謂歐洲的文化生活。其傳統所自。到了大帝時代。獲得了急捷的進步。我對着這像。禁不住要說。</p>
<p>﹁偉大的英雄啊。奧大維。﹂</p>
<p>的確。奧大維時代的羅馬。便是比律克Ｐｅｒｉｃｌｅｓ時代的希臘。是歷史上先後輝耀的黃金時代。試問。歐洲從那時起一直到現在。曾否有過第二個那麼偉大的帝王呢。﹁前不見古人。後不見來者。﹂這時候。我不自知地陷於蒼茫的感慨中了。</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Arrives in Tianjin to Negotiate the Abolition of the Likin Tax</h3>
<p>Song's Statement to Reporters</p>
<p>Accompanied by secretaries Zhu Zhicheng and Yang Jun, councilor Shen Qingqi, inspector He Zhifen, and Song Wenbin, director of the Jinpu Goods Tax Bureau, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen arrived in Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Zhang Xueliang welcomed him at the station and they went to Kiessling's for breakfast. Song stayed at Gao Jiyi's residence. Wang Shuchang, chairman of the province, and Zang Qifang, mayor of the city, along with Yao Hong, director of the Finance Department, hosted a luncheon at the Xihu Hotel to welcome Song, inviting figures from the banking and financial sectors to attend. At 4:00 PM, Song visited Zhang to discuss the abolition of the likin tax in North China. At 8:00 PM, Zhang hosted a banquet for Song at Gao's residence, inviting various generals to attend and introducing Song to generals from the Northwest Army and the Jin Army for discussions. The banquet ended at 10:00 PM, and Zhang invited Song to Xiaping'an to watch a movie. On the morning of the 10th, Wang Shuchang hosted breakfast for Song at Gao's residence. Jing Youyan, special commissioner of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Peiping, hosted a luncheon at the Salt Industry Bank for Song and his entourage, inviting figures from the banking and financial sectors to attend. At 6:00 PM, Director Zhang Xueming hosted a public banquet for Song at his private residence. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>Song met with reporters in Tianjin and stated that he had been away from Peiping and Tianjin for two years. Now that the country is unified, he came to Tianjin to inspect the situation after the abolition of the likin tax. He had discussed the issue of compensatory taxes after the abolition with Zhang via telegram, but not in great detail. Therefore, he came to meet with Zhang to study the matter further. The central government plans to implement five types of unified taxes and nineteen types of special consumption taxes. The unified tobacco and wheat flour taxes have already been implemented. The draft regulations for the unified match, cement, and cotton yarn taxes, as well as the consumption tax, have been completed and will be promulgated once they are passed by the Legislative Yuan. Zhang, with revolutionary spirit, resolutely announced the abolition of the likin tax in the eight provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The central government will find ways to remedy any difficulties that arise thereafter. The revenue of the customs offices in various regions is limited, and it is planned to abolish them in the near future without affecting foreign debt. The national abolition of the likin tax will result in a loss of over 90 million yuan, which will be compensated for by the implementation of five unified taxes and nineteen special taxes. The revenue from the unified and special taxes will belong to the central government, while the revenue from business, land, and inheritance taxes will belong to the local governments. Regulations for the business tax have also been drafted and will be promulgated after officials from the finance departments of various provinces come to the Ministry for consultation. In the future, when special taxes are implemented, Chinese customs officials will be transferred to oversee them, and staff will be recruited and guaranteed treatment in accordance with the customs officer system. Tobacco bonds have already been issued to compensate for the empty treasury after the war, rather than to compensate for the losses from the abolition of the likin tax in various provinces. The United States intends to lend money to China, but this is not to aid China. It is because the western United States has a surplus of silver, and the price of gold has skyrocketed. They want to exchange it for gold from China to make up for their losses. As for the demobilization expenses for each year and the issue of aid for Shanxi currency, Zhang is responsible for consulting with the generals, and I will not interfere. I will stay in Tianjin for three or two days and then return to Nanjing. Chiang will not go north or to Shaanxi in the near future. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>The Peiping General Chamber of Commerce held a general meeting today to discuss the issue of accepting special taxes and decided to draft opinions by committee to submit to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the early promulgation of new tax regulations to provide a standard and avoid the resurrection of disguised likin taxes. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Hosts a Banquet for Important Figures in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang of Nanjing hosted a spring banquet at the Lixingshe at 5:00 PM on the 10th, inviting senior party, government, and military officials in Nanjing, including Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Lin Sen, Liu Shangqing, Niu Yongjian, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, He Yaozu, and Zhu Peide, totaling over 120 people. The banquet began at 6:00 PM in the main hall, which was brilliantly lit and reflected the snow scene, making it even more delightful. During the banquet, Chiang stood up and gave a speech, stating that as we gather today, thinking of the compatriots who died for the revolution, we should work even harder for the party and the country. He also said that the reason why China is poor and weak is because we are in the age of consumption of the 20th century, but we only have the production of the 18th century. How can we not be poor? China could originally be self-sufficient in terms of clothing, food, and housing, but unfortunately, foreign goods are used everywhere, leading to the outflow of national interests, which is deeply regrettable. Even Chinese cuisine is so delicious, but Chinese people prefer to eat Western food. In short, even in the smallest matters, we should think about the interests of the country and should be frugal. The Lixingshe advocates frugality. Today, we welcome everyone with a glass of water and wish everyone good health. Then, Huang Renlin reported on the new method of rewarding the troops. The banquet ended at 9:00 PM. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>

(2) In terms of powers, the National Conference is responsible for the construction of the Republic of China, solving important issues during the period of political tutelage, concentrating national capabilities to establish the foundation of government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and clarifying the responsibilities of the Party during the period of governance. The National Assembly is stated in Articles 23 and 24 of the National Construction Outline to decide on the constitution, to have the right to elect and recall central government officials, and to have the right to initiate and veto central laws.

<h3>Negotiations on the Recovery of Extraterritoriality</h3>
<p>Replies from Various Countries Arrive One After Another</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing sent notes to six countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil, urging them to send personnel to negotiate in order to find a practical solution to the issue of extraterritoriality as soon as possible. Since the issuance of the notes, as of the 10th, various countries have successively replied to China, stating that their governments also hope to resolve the issue of jurisdiction as soon as possible and are considering a practical solution. They hope that both parties will agree to resolve this issue through meetings. The wording of the replies from the United Kingdom and the United States is better. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>Wu Chaoshu in Nanjing telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, urging the US government to continue negotiations on extraterritoriality so that it can be resolved quickly. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues a Declaration on Opium Prohibition</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing issued a declaration today, stating that for the past two years, China has spared no effort in investigating and prohibiting the trade of opium and other narcotics and has successively promulgated various regulatory regulations, such as the inspection of poppy cultivation by local officials, the punishment rules for opium cases, and the investigation of officials. In addition, at meetings during the anti-opium week, during various memorial weeks, and in newspapers, magazines, and publications, the harm of opium has been repeatedly stated, and it must be stopped immediately. Moreover, the government and local groups often cooperate, such as the Shanghai National Anti-Drug Association, whose branches are spread throughout the country, and its publicity is very effective. The customs authorities are also quite active in cracking down on the smuggling of narcotics, and they are now preparing to manage the national opium trade. In the future, the import and export of raw opium will be managed by an internal organization. The annual import quota will be decided by the State Council, and sales in various regions will be handled by pharmacies, and only Shanghai will be designated as the import port. Recently, illegal drug trade has been carried out by foreign large-scale traffickers. For example, in 1929, the customs seized 5,000 ounces (approximately one tael per ounce) of cocaine, 10,000 ounces of morphine, 3,000 ounces of heroin, and 6,000 ounces of opium, as well as 10,000 drug needles, and there are countless others that are not counted. The places of origin are Japan, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Russia, Hungary, France, the United Kingdom, and Korea. As for the overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands, although countless people are addicted to opium, the governments of those places, such as the British Straits Settlements, the Malay Straits, Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies, French Annam, Macau, and Taiwan, all have opium monopolies, and the government's tax revenue depends on it, so it should be discussed separately. And the Chinese government cannot provide assistance, so China's opium prohibition is very difficult and requires the cooperation and sacrifice of all relevant countries to be effective. (Special dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>The Problem of Reducing Provincial Areas</h3>
<p>The Central Political Council Collects Materials</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>A Review of the Past Nine Days</h3>
<p>From the New Year's holiday closure until today, the world situation remains the same. The stagnation of commerce in various countries, the daily increase in unemployment, and the ineffectiveness of relief efforts have not seen any progress. The only changes are the daily rise in gold prices and the daily fall in silver prices. Although world commerce is seeking remedies daily, none have been effective.</p>
<p>As for politics, the results of the Indian Round Table Conference have not shown much progress. Indian opposition has not weakened slightly, and there are no signs of compromise between Muslims and Hindus. This is one issue. The political strife in the Japanese Diet is about to begin, and the tool being used is still the economic problem, compounded by the fact that Minister of State Shidehara, as a non-party member, is representing the Prime Minister at the conference, leading to attacks. This is another issue. The German Ministry of Finance has a new plan for unemployment, allocating 300 million marks annually for unemployment relief, but to no avail. It intends to use this money to make production cheaper and increase it, but German industrialists believe that this kind of national subsidy will shake the credibility of Germany's financial policy and oppose it. Germany is still unable to solve the problem of unemployment satisfactorily. This is another issue. In short, the politics of various countries remain the same as yesterday.</p>

<p>Washington, 8th (Reuters): It is reported that the Senate committee investigating the reasons for the decline in Sino-American trade will recommend to the President that he initiate international negotiations to lend silver to China. The amount has not been mentioned. The committee also advocates negotiations with the British government and others to end Britain's policy of selling silver from India, and to discuss with other countries whether it is possible to set an international silver price. The chairman of the committee said that Britain's policy of selling Indian silver in a weak market is the main cause of the world's commercial depression. The committee believes that if China is assisted in restoring sound financial conditions, China can develop greatly, and bandits and warlords can gradually be eliminated. With national peace and financial stability, the purchasing power of the people can be greatly increased, and international trade with China can be revitalized. Even the surplus wheat in the United States can be distributed to China.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Reuters): The Senate Committee on Sino-American Trade's proposal to lend silver to China coincides with the plan of Canadian Minister of Commerce Wen. It is reported that the Canadian Department of Commerce proposed to lend 200 million pounds to China for the purpose of restoring silver prices and assisting China's reorganization.</p>
<p>New York, 9th (Reuters): The possibility of the United States joining with other countries to grant huge silver loans to China has aroused great interest among Canadian bankers and financiers. Because the surplus wheat in the United States and Canada can be sold to China, this kind of loan will not only benefit China, but also benefit the United States. However, bankers believe that publicly soliciting Chinese loans is completely out of the question. This loan must take the form of an international government debt guarantee.</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, 9th (Associated Press): According to members of the International Silver Market Committee, China has requested a silver loan of 200 million ounces, to be delivered before February 10, and has been approved. The opinion of the committee members is that they should immediately raise this silver loan in order to promote world trade and curb the continued decline in silver prices. At today's meeting, the committee agreed with the suggestion made by Mr. Bittman, a member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee, to lend silver to China. The committee members also announced that they advocated that the British and American countries open negotiations to prevent India from over-selling silver in the world market, and the members also strongly advocated convening an international silver market conference as soon as possible to prepare methods to rescue the silver market.</p>
<h3>London Naval Treaty Effective</h3>
<p>Franco-Italian Negotiations Stalled Again</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Associated Press): President Hoover today issued a clear order announcing that the London Naval Treaty of 1930 will take effect immediately. According to the treaty, it was recently passed by the government of the Irish Free State, and other participating countries have already fully ratified the treaty. This is why Mr. Hoover's order was issued today. It has been eight months since the London Naval Treaty was signed, and it has only officially come into effect today. In 1935, a naval reduction conference will continue to be convened. If countries are dissatisfied with the treaty, they can propose amendments.</p>
<p>Rome Dispatch: After the end of the Franco-Italian naval construction truce on December 31, it is believed that naval construction by both sides will be revived, but the scope will be temporarily reduced. The responsible parties have not abandoned hope of reaching a compromise. During the truce, there was no real progress in the negotiations between the two sides, with one side insisting on the principle of equality and the other opposing it. Mussolini recently reiterated in a radio speech that he supports any disarmament plan, as long as France and other United Nations proceed together. It is expected that Italy is currently focusing its full attention on domestic economic and financial issues, especially unemployment, so it has no time for international issues. It is expected that there will be no important decisions on foreign policy before the spring (World).</p>
<h3>French General Joffre Dies</h3>

<p>Solemn and Solemn Ceremony</p>
<p>Paris, 3rd (Reuters): General Joffre passed away at 8:23 AM on the morning of the 3rd, at the age of 79. He studied at the Jiangye Vocational School in his youth and was proficient in arithmetic. He served in the military during the Franco-Prussian War. In 1905, he was promoted to general. He served in China, Vietnam, and Korea.</p>

After the news of his death spread, condolences poured in. British Prime Minister MacDonald sent a telegram to the French Foreign Minister on behalf of the British government, stating that the British people will never forget the great contributions of the deceased general in the bleak situation of 1914. The British Navy and Marine Corps also sent telegrams of condolence. The British Emperor even telegraphed the French President to express his condolences for Joffre's death, saying that all countries that were allied with France in 1914 were especially saddened. The French government decided to hold a national funeral for him on the 7th. (3rd)</p>

<p>Paris, 7th (Reuters): General Joffre's remains were moved to Notre Dame Cathedral last night to prepare for the funeral today. The streets through which the coffin passed were a desolate sight. The street lights were dim, and the guards carrying the coffin walked with torches. Today, before dawn, mourners were already crowded in the streets. At 8:30, dignitaries from various countries gathered in the church, and then the funeral ceremony was held, which was extremely solemn. After the ceremony, the coffin was carried out, led by French cavalry, followed by British, American, and French soldiers, followed by two red-robed cardinals and more than ten purple-robed priests. A gun carriage carried the coffin slowly, with infantry guarding on both sides. Behind the car were representatives from various countries and diplomatic personnel. Except for the funeral music, the streets were silent. After traveling three miles, it reached the place where the coffin was parked. The mourners paid their respects to the coffin and retreated. The coffin will be transported to Lorraine for burial within days, in accordance with the general's will.</p>

The guards surrendered. President Arosemena announced his resignation. Provisional President Anliens declared that the purpose of the revolution was to "purge the government of its filth and eliminate all corrupt practices." (World News)</p>
<h3>Seiyukai's Strategy for the Diet Session</h3>
<p>Planning a Head-on Attack on the Acting Prime Minister</p>
<p>Inevitable Large-Scale Upheaval</p>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo, 10th: It is now clear that Prime Minister Hamaguchi will not be able to attend the Diet session after the recess. The Seiyukai plans to launch a fierce attack at the beginning of the Diet session, before Prime Minister Shidehara's policy speech. Their reasoning is that it is politically and morally impermissible for Shidehara, who is not affiliated with any party, to act as Prime Minister of a party cabinet and attend the Diet session. Currently, concrete methods of attack are being studied in secret. In other words, the Seiyukai will submit an urgent inquiry before the first day's agenda, questioning whether Prime Minister Hamaguchi will attend the Diet session. Depending on the response, they will either propose an urgent motion to temporarily adjourn the Imperial Diet until Prime Minister Hamaguchi can attend, or they will reject Shidehara's acting Prime Ministership, arguing that a non-party member acting as Prime Minister responsible to the Diet is unacceptable in terms of party politics. They plan to choose one of these two options. There is still room for research on the second option, and the result may be to adopt the second option, namely, to request a motion for the adjournment of the Diet session. In short, the Seiyukai is determined to attack the government at the beginning of the Diet session for sending an acting Prime Minister to attend the Diet session, considering it a serious mistake in constitutional politics. If the government remains stubbornly indifferent to this issue, they will definitely not allow Prime Minister Shidehara to deliver his policy speech. Therefore, the beginning of this Diet session is bound to cause a large-scale upheaval. Dentsu Tokyo, 10th: The draft of Acting Prime Minister Shidehara's policy speech will be submitted to the cabinet on the 16th or 20th, and then submitted to the Emperor for approval. The content focuses on diplomacy and finance. Regarding diplomatic issues, it first clarifies that the London Naval Treaty has made a great contribution to promoting world peace, and then celebrates the conclusion of the treaty to reduce the burden on the people. Regarding financial issues, it explains the budget for Showa 6 (1931), especially the content of the tax reduction plan, and then states that it is firmly believed that the recession can gradually recover. The content is quite substantial.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices in Tianjin: Likin is the worst of evils taxes, directly increasing the burden on the people and indirectly hindering the development of commerce and industry. For the benefit of the people's livelihood, it is appropriate to abolish it. This is not only necessary for external relations, but also a far-sighted plan for the country by the central government to resolutely abolish likin. All officials throughout the country should earnestly and thoroughly comply. Although the northern provinces have never had the name of likin, all transit taxes similar in nature to likin should also be abolished. An order has been issued to the seven provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Jehol, Hebei, Chahar, and Shanxi to stop collecting them uniformly from today. From now on, the tax revenue of each province shall be handled in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry. This is specially reported for your information. Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices in Xi'an: I have just read the telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, to implement the abolition of likin and complete the revolutionary cause. The words are earnest and deeply admired. Likin is the biggest evil in our country, hindering livelihoods and fostering corruption. Its implementation has been long and the people have suffered greatly. It has only been regarded as a source of profit by warlords and controlled by officials, remaining unchanged and causing deep harm. Now is the time when unification is completed and all government affairs are renewed. If we do not overcome all difficulties and resolutely abolish it, as the original telegram said, there is no way to purify officialdom, no way to save people's hearts, and no way to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood. There is nothing more obstructive to the completion of the revolution than this. The provincial government previously received an order from the Executive Yuan and ministries and has already implemented the abolition. Now, in accordance with the previous order, in addition to replying by telegram to comply within the time limit, we respectfully lead all the people of Shaanxi to sincerely support the abolition in order to benefit its progress. This telegram is specially reported for your information. Please consider it. Shaanxi Provincial Government.</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices in Kaifeng: Likin is a bad tax that has long been a disease of the world. The central government has decided to abolish likin in order to plan for the long term. Our province has repeatedly received clear orders and should vigorously implement them. We have already, on December 31st of the 19th year, abolished all likin in Henan Province, as well as various tax bureaus similar to likin, stopped collection, and set a time limit for closure, in order to completely clear up years of abusive administration and create a new record in the history of finance. In addition to reporting separately by telegram, this telegram is respectfully reported for your information. Please consider it. Henan Provincial Finance Department.</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices in Hangzhou: The harm of likin is known throughout the country. Drinking poison to quench thirst has been going on for nearly a hundred years. The national economy has been unable to develop under the double pressure of internal and external forces, and the imperialists have used likin as an excuse to obstruct our country's tariff autonomy. Our central government has considered the long term, endured the pain for a moment, and set a time limit for abolition, which is truly unavoidable. Likin in Zhejiang Province has always been a major source of revenue for the provincial treasury, and its abolition will have a significant impact. However, for the sake of the survival of the country and the livelihood of the people, there is no room for this kind of bad tax to continue to exist. We respectfully abolished all likin and similar taxes in the entire province on January 1st of the 20th year, in order to live up to the central government's supreme constitution of removing the old and establishing the new. This is specially reported for your information. Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices in Nanchang: (Omitted above) The likin in our province has long been handled by the Jiangxi Finance Special Commissioner, changed to special taxes, in accordance with the central government's standards for dividing national and local taxes. It will be abolished immediately. As for various taxes similar to likin at the local level, such as the Nansun Municipal Special Tax, the Autonomous Special Tax, the Second Set Entrance Tax, and the 20% Municipal Tax on Tobacco and Alcohol, all of them have been abolished on the 31st of this month in accordance with the order, and other ways to compensate for them are being sought. All of them have been resolved and passed by the Provincial Affairs Conference and reported to the central government for the record. It is hoped that the whole country will unite to support the implementation of new construction plans. The party and the country depend on this. This telegram is specially reported for your information. Please consider it. Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Shu Dipin.</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices in Ningxia: We have received a telegram from the Director of the Northwest Pacification Headquarters stating that we have received a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief stating that Ma Hongbin has been appointed as the Commander of the Newly Compiled 7th Division of the Central Army and the Commander of the Gansu-Liangzhou-Suzhou Border Defense. This telegram is for your information, etc. Upon receiving this, Hongbin will take up his concurrent positions at the defense location in Ningxia this winter. With humble talent, he has been wrongly entrusted with heavy responsibility. Like walking on thin ice or treading on a tiger's tail, he is afraid of falling and failing. I humbly implore famous scholars and military leaders at home and abroad to consider the friendship of embracing the swamp and to bestow words of gold and stone so that they can be followed and used to correct shortcomings. Cloud Heaven first, with endless dependence. This telegram is respectfully reported for your information. Please consider it. Ma Hongbin, Commander of the Newly Compiled 7th Division of the Central Army and Commander of the Gansu-Liangzhou-Suzhou Border Defense.</p>

<h3>The Central Party Department's First Commemoration Week of This Year</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Reports on Efforts for This Year</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The Central Party Department held its 93rd Sun Yat-sen Commemoration Week at 9:00 AM on the 5th. Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, Ma Chaojun, Chen Lifu, Chen Yaoyuan, Li Wenfan, Miao Peicheng, Shao Yuanchong, Jiao Yitang, and staff members, totaling approximately 500 people, attended. Chairman Sun Ke led the ceremony. Subsequently, Committee Member Chiang Kai-shek reported, stating in brief: "Today is the first Commemoration Week of the 20th year of the Republic. Mr. Hu has already reported on the various situations of party affairs, politics, and military affairs last year on New Year's Day. When we look back and examine the work of our party, we rely on the efforts of all comrades to achieve great progress. However, no matter how much progress we make, we cannot be satisfied. Thinking about the future, China's position in the international community, and the points that our comrades should strive for, I would like to report my personal opinions to everyone. The responsibility for China's position and responsibility in the world in the 20th year of the Republic (i.e., 1931) naturally falls on our Chinese Kuomintang. Our party has a very important responsibility for China's future, so our comrades must work harder than in previous years. However, we believe that no matter what dangers China encounters, with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, China will definitely not perish, but will be able to create a new life for China in the midst of crisis, and thus achieve liberation and independence, and the nation can develop from this. The opportunity for a country to develop and create often arises during the most dangerous period, and this depends entirely on the efforts of our comrades."</p>
<p>"Last year, foreigners and comrades within the party criticized our party a lot, and we ourselves can criticize ourselves, because only with dissatisfaction can there be progress. However, we must know that our party has been making progress every year, and party members have been making progress every day. The progress may not be visible to oneself, or one may not want to exaggerate it, but if the party affairs and party members' experience are insufficient, the organizational ability is insufficient, or the guidance of the Central Committee members is improper, or the organization is incomplete, we will correct it as soon as we see it. This is our progress. The Chinese Kuomintang is a political revolutionary organization, and the political institution is the government. Such political progress, proceeding according to the Three Principles of the People, cannot be easily implemented without the full control of politics by our party comrades. Therefore, party members must have the career of shouldering political life. The majority of the party is in politics. On the one hand, we must make extra efforts in party affairs. We hope that we will know that party members are political reserve personnel. We must prepare to advance rapidly, hoping that within two years, political personnel, from the central government to the senior governments of various regions, will all be members of our party, so that the doctrine can be implemented and the revolution can be completed. My only hope is this point. Today, on the first Commemoration Week of this year, I report to all comrades, hoping that comrades will know the importance of responsibility and strive to fight harder." After Chiang's report, he announced the end of the ceremony and adjourned the meeting.</p>

<p>Party Department and National Government Hold Celebrations</p>
<p>The New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic has passed amidst the jubilant celebrations of the whole country. The grandeur of the New Year's Day celebration in the capital was unprecedented. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM, central figures went to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum to pay their respects.

<p>At 8:00 AM, the Central Party Department held a Grand Meeting to Commemorate the Founding of the Republic of China and Celebrate the New Year. Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Lin Sen, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, Wu Tiecheng, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Chiang Kai-shek, and representatives from various agencies and organizations, totaling approximately 500 people, attended. Hu Hanmin presided over the ceremony and led the participants in performing the rituals. Subsequently, he delivered a congratulatory speech, stating in brief: "Today is New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic. On this New Year, people from all walks of life across the country are enthusiastically celebrating, showing a spirit of development. All undertakings should be renewed and break away from the old ideas and habits of not forgetting the old lunar calendar. At the same time, it is also the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's assumption of office as the Founding President of the Republic of China. At the beginning of this year, we should recall the innovative spirit of the founding of the country and the founding principles and policies left by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and恪恪恪遵循 and promote their realization as soon as possible. The ancients said, 'The plan for the year lies in spring.' Looking back over the past nineteen years, it is still as Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last testament in the eighth year of the Republic said, 'There are three obstacles to the revolution, namely warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians, and politicians are especially unforgivable, being the greatest obstacle to all progress.' Last year, politicians colluded with warlords to cause chaos. Our party worked hard to quell the chaos, removing obstacles for the people, and there were unavoidable military actions. From this year onwards, all the resolutions cases handed over to the National Government by the Fourth Plenary Session, such as the bad policies of likin, must be eliminated, and new customs taxes must be implemented, and everything must be realized. We must strive to make the people and维新, and like the amnesty for political prisoners, it is also meant to get rid of the old and move towards the new. In the future, we hope that the people's revolution should start with革心. At the same time, we recall Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Northern Expedition Declaration, which mentioned convening a National Assembly. For several years, due to the disturbances of the warlords, it has not been realized, and the people have not been able to express their true intentions. Now we are determined to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and convene a National Assembly. Its election law has been promulgated by the National Government, which is to seek the unification and construction of China, and submit the declarations and platforms of several national congresses of our party to the meeting, so that the people can truly understand and protect their freedom of election and freedom to discuss the tutelage plan. If there are those that cannot be used, they will be revised. In addition, like the organization of the Examination Yuan, it has been completed, and from this year onwards, it can implement the matters that should be done within its powers. The Supervisory Yuan will also be fully established within this month and implement its powers. The education cause has recently been taken over by Committee Member Chiang Kai-shek concurrently serving as the Minister of Education, which is also intended to fundamentally renew it. In the past, every New Year was a pre-celebration, but there was no policy to report. This year is different from the past. We ourselves believe that we can report to the people without愧. Good laws and 美意 add people's fortune. Looking back on the past and forecasting the future, we should suppress the Communist bandits internally and abolish unequal treaties externally. This is what we should strive for the most this year, especially for the abolition of unequal treaties, and the implementation methods will be stipulated within two months. Every time we respectfully read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last testament, we feel that the responsibility is very heavy when we read the last few sentences. Therefore, today's New Year's celebration is different from ordinary celebrations. In Guangzhou, there are three words of congratulations among the people during the New Year: one is to congratulate on getting rich, the second is to congratulate on adding a son, and the third is to congratulate on everything going smoothly. What we congratulate on is first for the whole country to get rich, for the people's livelihood to get rich, second is for the country to create people, for the Republic to add丁, and third is that all things of the public are as the people wish. Therefore, I congratulate everyone on getting rich, adding丁, and everything going smoothly." (The whole audience applauded and cheered) After Hu's speech, the music was played and the end of the ceremony was announced, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>At 8:30 AM, Zhang Fengjiu, the representative of the Xinjiang Provincial Government stationed in Beijing, along with Guanglu, the representative of the玉 representation, respectfully presented the jade material for the National Seal to the First Conference Hall of the National Government. Chairman Chiang personally accepted it. Zhang Fengjiu gave a congratulatory speech, and Chairman Chiang thanked him and expressed his condolences to Jin Shuren, the chairman of the new provincial government, and Zhang and Guang immediately entered and exited.</p>
<p>At 8:40 AM, the Conferment Ceremony was held in the First Conference Hall of the National Government. The recipients were Yang Shuzhuang and Gu Zhutong. Chairman Chiang personally awarded Yang with the First Class Baoding Medal.</p>

No matter which comrade, we must all remember the infinite hardships and difficulties that our Premier and the general martyrs below the Premier endured in building the Republic of China, and only then do we have today. In the future, the responsibility rests on our shoulders. How hard should we strive to continue the cause of our Premier, carry forward the spirit of our martyrs, and complete our revolutionary responsibility. Today, on New Year's Day, there is no other contribution. I hope that everyone will continue to work hard and truly build a strong and healthy new China to complete our revolutionary mission and realize our Premier's Three Principles of the People. I wish you all good health and progress in the New Year." Then the music was played, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's New Year's Day Military Parade</h3>
<p>On the morning of New Year's Day, the 20th year, a military parade was held at the Capital Airfield. The order was perfect, and the results were excellent, unprecedented. Seven decorated platforms were erected at the western end of the airfield, with the reviewing stand in the center. On both sides were special viewing stands and foreign guest viewing stands, and further to the sides were the first, second, third, and fourth viewing stands. The location was spacious and the order was well-maintained.

Foreign guests included more than twenty ministers and consuls from various countries. At 10:20 AM, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, arrived at the airfield by car from the south end of the field. Immediately, military music sounded in unison, and soldiers raised their guns in salute. (Chairman Chiang wore a yellow wool military dress uniform, a command saber, and a yellow wool cloak that day. Madame Chiang wore a sable fur cloak.) After arriving at the field, they ascended the reviewing stand. After a brief rest, Feng Yifei, the commander of the parade, reported the start of the parade and reported the number of soldiers being reviewed, including three infantry regiments, one artillery battalion, one engineer battalion, one cavalry battalion, and one tank team, with a total of 5,972 officers and soldiers and 972 horses.

<p>Chairman Chiang's address: "Comrades, today is New Year's Day, the anniversary of the founding of our Republic of China. It is the day when our leader Sun Yat-sen founded the provisional government in Nanjing and became the provisional president twenty years ago. All of us comrades and all the soldiers, from this New Year's Day onwards, must understand the difficulties of our leader in founding the Republic of China, and the heroic sacrifices of our deceased comrades and soldiers. We must continue the spirit of our leader and the martyrs and fulfill the responsibility of the revolution. This all rests on the shoulders of us comrades and soldiers. Especially now that we have completely suppressed the domestic rebels, internal troubles and foreign aggression are still pressing in. The future of our revolution is still very dangerous. Therefore, all of us soldiers, from today onwards, must work harder and struggle harder. We must complete the responsibility of our national revolution. We must fulfill our leader's will and truly implement our Three Principles of the People. Only in this way can we be worthy of our leader and our deceased soldiers, and only then can we achieve our mission. On this anniversary of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, let us all soldiers shout these slogans in unison: 'Follow the teachings of our leader!' 'Implement the Three Principles of the People!' 'Vigorously implement political tutelage and construction!' 'Rectify national politics!' 'Strive to develop the frontier regions!' 'Eradicate the heinous communist bandits!' 'Eliminate feudal remnants!' 'Abolish unequal treaties!' 'Long live the National Government!' 'Long live the Kuomintang!' 'Long live the Republic of China!'"</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin's speech briefly stated: "Comrades, compatriots, today is the New Year's Day of the twentieth year of the Republic of China. Everyone is holding a military parade in the rain and can still perform so well. The spirit and steps are much better than previous military parades. The spirit of returning from the bitter fighting at the front has all been displayed. There is a saying: 'A soldier may not be used for a hundred years, but cannot be unprepared for a single day.' This means to pay attention to training. All units are now so well trained. Just now, Chairman Chiang has given a lot of encouragement. Now, let me add two more sentences, that is, there are two elements for a country to become strong: one is military force, and the other is law. In the past year, the warlords have all been swept away by military force. The army is the guardian of the country and deserves the admiration of the people of the whole country. Our leader's teachings say, 'Never slacken day or night, follow the doctrine.' What we rely on is doctrine, and we still need to work together to have a day where we can thoroughly implement the doctrine from beginning to end. What the people hope for is international equality, and the soldiers are the vanguard for the people. The glorious history of the past should not only be preserved, but also be carried forward and further developed." After Hu Hanmin finished speaking, Chairman Chiang again asked He Yingqin and Zhu Peide to speak. Both He and Zhu declined modestly. Then, the meeting ended and people dispersed. It was already 12:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Province Celebrates the New Year Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The authorities of this province, because this New Year is the first after advocating peace and achieving unification, which is a great phenomenon in twenty years, so the enthusiasm for its celebration and the activeness of its promotion are more solemn than in previous years. Beforehand, all the important departments built pine and cypress arches, decorated with lanterns and colorful decorations, which were extremely spectacular. The arch in front of the Northeast Border Defense Commander's Office had the four characters "Universal Celebration," and the arch in front of the Liaoning Provincial Government had the four characters "For Ten Thousand Years," all made of five-color electric lights. The electric lights were turned on every night, dazzling and eye-catching. All other military and political agencies, legal groups, schools, and businesses all uniformly hung the party and national flags, fluttering in the wind, creating a solemn atmosphere. The Liaoning-Ning Provincial Government also issued instructions to its subordinate agencies at the end of the 19th year, saying, "According to the telegram from the Executive Yuan, the holiday dates for the national calendar New Year have now been stipulated by the Central Government to be changed to five days, from December 31st to January 4th. The old calendar New Year, all sectors shall not suspend business, in order to promote the national calendar and shift the people's habits. In addition to issuing a circular, we first send a telegram, hoping that you will order your subordinates to abide by it, etc." The Northeast Political Affairs Committee also sent a telegram with the same content. In addition to distributing it, we jointly ordered all to abide by it." All agencies complied with the order and took a five-day holiday, from this date to January 4th. Because the fifth day happened to be a Sunday holiday, an extra day off was given on the 5th. All schools followed the regulations of the Department of Education, and the original three-day holiday was changed to a five-day New Year holiday in order to respect the central government's explicit orders and effectively promote the national calendar, to show uniformity. The major businesses in the provincial capital all closed down and hung flags to celebrate. On New Year's Day, at twelve noon, the provincial government invited the heads of military and political agencies and the leaders of legal groups to hold a group worship ceremony in the auditorium of the provincial government to celebrate.

The Fourth Plenary Session started at 8:00 AM, chaired by Chen Mingshu, with a long speech. Then, delegates took the stage to give speeches, which ended around 10:00 AM. Immediately afterwards, the 20th Anniversary of the Founding Meeting continued, chaired by Chen Jitang, who announced the reasons for the meeting.

<h3>A Tragic Train Robbery by Bandits on the Beining Railway</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: On December 27th of last year, the No. 501 passenger train from Jin County to Beipiao on the Jin-Chao branch of the Beining Railway was derailed by bandits who had deliberately destroyed the tracks between Nanling and Koubeiyingzi that night. As a result, the entire train was in danger of overturning, and the bandits boarded the train and robbed it, causing many passenger casualties and extremely heavy losses. This was a major unfortunate event after the Lincheng robbery case. According to the telegram from the Beipiao Traffic Section Chief to the Beining Railway Bureau, the situation at the time of the accident was that approximately 80 passengers were killed, 20 were seriously injured, and 30 hostages were taken away by the bandits. Recognizing the seriousness of the case, the extraordinary nature of the incident, and the significant impact on transportation, the Bureau immediately telegraphed Rong Zhen, the Director of the Military Affairs Department of the Border Defense Commander's Office, and Zhang Tingzhu, the Brigade Commander of the 12th Brigade of the Jin County Garrison, requesting them to send troops to assist in pursuing and suppressing the escaped bandits. The Bureau also telegraphed the situation to Deputy Commander Zhang in Tianjin, the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, and the Northeast Transportation Committee. Furthermore, in order to investigate the actual situation at the site of the accident, the Bureau sent Xu Wenguo, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Law Bureau, Wang Fengrui, the Director of the Transportation Department, and Niu Yaonan, the Chief of the Investigation Section of the Shenyang Office, to the site of the accident for a joint survey. After the matter was completed, Niu returned to Shenyang, and Xu and Wang also returned to Tianjin. According to Niu's report, the accident occurred at around 6:00 PM on the 27th of this month. The accident site was located between the number plates 2950 and 2975 between Nanling and Koubeiyingzi stations, in front of the number 30 road house. The road platform was close to the mountain gorge, and the terrain was very dangerous. After measurement by the engineering department, the depth was about 70 to 80 feet. When the bandits attacked, they all carried guns, weapons, and sticks. First, they tied up the workers in the road house and seized their tools to cut off more than ten feet of track. When the No. 501 train arrived at that location, it derailed and the entire train overturned on the upper and lower levels of the road platform. Locomotive No. 172, due to its weight, mostly inserted into the ground, leaving only the front part of the car. Passenger cars No. 1083, No. 43, No. 34167, and baggage car No. 1707 were close to the locomotive and were burned by the fire, leaving only the wheels and parts. Passenger cars No. 94 and No. 132, as well as open cars No. 3575 and No. 3496, were all damaged. Mixed car No. 1035 was lying across the road and did not fall down, so the damage was lighter. After the accident, the local garrison forces who came to the rescue included one company of soldiers from the 32nd Brigade of Yi County and 40 soldiers from the First Cavalry Division of Beipiao, as well as the road police from Nanling and Koubeiyingzi stations, the Jin County Security Team, and the Beipiao Clinic of the Hospital and the Beipiao Coal Mine Hospital. All the demolished parts were repaired by 10:20 AM on the 29th and traffic was resumed as usual. However, the description of the losses this time differed greatly from the report of the Beipiao Traffic Section Chief on the day of the accident, with only nine passenger deaths, the burning deaths of Xue An, the material keeper of the road, and Cui Jufu, the material watcher. Zheng Yulin, a stoker of the road, was crushed to death by the locomotive. Four passengers and two workers of the road were seriously injured. About 30 passengers and employees of the road were slightly injured. Some went home to heal themselves, and some were treated at the hospital. Currently, there is only one person in the Jin County Hospital, and the rest have been discharged. Two of the bodies of the deceased passengers have been claimed. Because the remaining bodies were bloody and incomplete, they could not be identified, so arrangements have been made to prepare coffins for them to be claimed. The overturned and damaged vehicles are now on the left side of the road platform and will be dismantled and sent to the factory for repair in the coming days. The Railway Bureau, due to the recent rampant activities of bandits and the weakness of the road's military police, has submitted a request to the Commander's Office, strictly ordering the garrison troops along the road to effectively maintain traffic and ensure the safety of travelers. In addition, a similar incident occurred on the Siping-Taonan Railway on December 9th of last year, when bandits derailed and robbed a train. Recently, the Liaoning-Ning Provincial Government approved a telegram from the Northeast Transportation Committee, stating that 80 Mongolian bandits had again appeared on the south side of the railway more than ten miles west of Mendazhan Station on the Siping-Taonan Railway, attacked and broke through Dayefu Village, and injured or killed six or seven civilians. They are still entrenched and have not retreated, and are not far from the station, which poses a great danger. In addition to telegraphing the Commander-in-Chief's Office to order troops to suppress them, the government requested the government to order the county to send teams to assist in the suppression. The Provincial Government has now telegraphed the Liao Yuan Jin County Chief and the Tong Liao Wang County Chief, ordering them to immediately dispatch county police to join forces in the suppression. From this, it can be seen that the bandit atmosphere in this province is spreading, which is enough to cause hidden worries for the local government. (March 4th)</p>

<h3>Han Shisun and Ma Meet in Jinan</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: There was news a month ago that Shi Yousan, the Commander-in-Chief of the Thirteenth Route Army, would come to Jinan to meet with Han Fuju, the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government. On the 5th of this month, after Han went to northern Shandong for inspection, he suddenly received a telegram from Shi from the Shun'de defense area, saying that he would come to Shandong soon. Han immediately replied to Shi with a telegram from Dezhou, inviting him to come to Dezhou from Shun'de and take the train south together, and also telegraphed Ma Hongkui, the Commander-in-Chief of the Fifteenth Route Army in Tai'an, and Sun Lianzhong, the Commander-in-Chief of the Twenty-sixth Route Army in Jining, inviting them all to Jinan for a good meeting. This afternoon (7th) at 6 pm, Ma Hongkui had already arrived in Jinan by special train from Tai'an. According to Ma's conversation with reporters, the reorganization of his troops has been completed, and the military pay is 230,000 yuan per month, which is borne by the central government. Banditry is rampant in the Mengyin and Xintai areas of southern Shandong, and troops are being dispatched to encircle and suppress them. It is expected that it will be cleared soon. As for the vehicles borrowed by his troops from various routes, except for a few that will be temporarily borrowed, the rest have been completely returned to the various routes. As for Shi Yousan, he set off from Shun'de by car on the evening of the 6th with Army Commander Zhang Huanan, Commander Cheng Xixian, etc. Due to the snow on the road, it was delayed until 6 pm today (7th) before arriving in Dezhou. At about 7 pm, he took the special train with Han Fuju to the south, arriving in Jinan at 12:30 am. According to Shi's conversation with reporters, he has no special mission in coming to Shandong this time. Because of his deep personal friendship with the three commanders-in-chief Han, Ma, and Sun, and because they have been separated for a long time, he came to meet them. He does not plan to stay in Jinan for long and plans to return to his defense area the day after tomorrow (9th). According to Wei's words to reporters, he inspected various places in Dezhou, Linqing, and Pingyuan during his trip north. The local situation is very peaceful, and banditry has been eliminated.

<h3>Anhui Province Creates a Passport Fee for Exporting Rice and Grain</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Express Opposition</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The National Government has clearly ordered the abolition of Likin on New Year's Day of the 20th year, and the whole country has uniformly implemented it. The Likin Bureau of Anhui Province has indeed been abolished, and the Wuhu Anhui Rice Donation Bureau, similar to Likin, and the Sail-Transported Rice Donation Bureau of Dashengguan, have also stopped collecting donations on the first day in compliance with the order. However, rice is the main product of Anhui Province, and the prosperity and decline of the commercial market in southern Anhui is based on the rice market. Even in terms of tax revenue, rice donations are the largest. Now, after abolishing Likin, the Anhui Provincial Government has created a passport fee for exporting rice and grain, with the aim of prohibiting exports to avoid unrestrained rice exports and food shortages. To facilitate verification, the Finance Department has prepared passports. Whether rice and grain is transported by wheel or sail, it is necessary to apply for a rice passport before it is allowed to operate, and a passport fee is collected to show restrictions. The passport fee is 6 jiao per shi of rice, and 3 jiao per shi of paddy and miscellaneous grains. Those circulating within the province are not subject to this limit. A general office for inspecting rice passports for transport has been established in Wuhu, branch offices for inspecting rice passports for wheel transport have been established in Datong and Anqing, a general office for inspecting rice passports for sail transport has been established in Dashengguan, and branch offices for inspecting rice passports for sail transport have been established in Dingbu, Huayang, Tianchang, Wutai, Huaiyuan, Chuxian, Chenjiaqian, and other places. Yang Yizhai, the director of the Anhui Rice Donation Bureau, has been appointed as the director of the Wuhu Wheel Transport Rice Passport Inspection General Office, and Liu Jingbo has been appointed as the director of the Anhui Sail Transport Rice Passport Inspection General Office. After receiving the order from the provincial government, the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce convened a general meeting of all executives and supervisors. They all believed that the rice passport fee was actually a disguised Likin, and the fee charged was several times higher than the original Likin. As a result, the rice market will invisibly move to Nanjing, and the Wuhu commercial market will also be affected, which has a great impact on the Wuhu commercial city. It was decided to unanimously deny it. In addition to directly telegraphing to the Anhui Provincial Government to request an order to abolish it, the Joint Association of Chambers of Commerce of the whole province telegraphed to the Central Government requesting strict orders to regulate it, so as to comply with the original purpose of abolishing Likin and relieving the pain of merchants and people. On the rice merchant side, the rice and grain transported to Wuhu last year was no less than 500,000 shi, which is urgently needed to be exported, and most of it has already paid Likin. This time, they have to pay the export rice passport fee, which is multiple levies on one item, which is extremely difficult to bear. They have also telegraphed to the provincial government and all parties to call for abolition. (8th)</p>

Therefore, a meeting was held on the 8th to discuss and decided to telegraph the Finance Department for verification. The text said, "The implementation of the business tax is now starting to be investigated. The association's responsibility to assist is undeniable. However, various merchants have implemented the abolition of Likin. If the business tax is to be levied at 2%, the public is panic-stricken. Although the association has explained in detail the Finance Department's reply to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce (reported in this newspaper in December of the 19th year), all merchants still doubt that it has not been promulgated. It is especially difficult to determine the prosperity and decline of the business. We beg to clearly indicate how much the tax rate is to be levied, so as to avoid misunderstandings. The Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce bows and inquires."</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>

<p>Proposal to Suppress Lake Bandits Lake bandits have been rampant in recent years, harassing various places. During the New Year, all sectors rest, and the bandits have not rested much. In Kunshan and Changshu, which are close to Dianshan and Yangcheng, robbery cases occur almost every day.

It is proposed to establish military institutions on the east and west sides of Dongting Mountain to specialize in defense and suppression, and surround the bandit areas on all sides to wipe them out in one fell swoop." The Wujiang issue is "Please consider dispatching a company of army to be stationed at the Dabiaogang on the lakeside to trấn懾 because the Nanku Temple in the vicinity of Dabiaogang has always been a bandit's nest, and the newly opened road in Maokigang near Dongshan, and the Sanshan near Xishan, are all places where lake bandits appear."</p>
<p>Each Industry in the New Year Last year, the profit and loss situation of various industries in Suzhou has been recorded in this newspaper on New Year's Day.

At the end of the Gregorian New Year, six or seven families in urban and rural areas went bankrupt, which is an unprecedented depression in the past one hundred years. As for the collection of accounts, except for drug stores and other three or two industries that collect accounts according to the Gregorian calendar, the accounts of all other large and small industries are settled but not collected, and they still need to be collected during the Lunar New Year. There is a phenomenon of the New Year being like the old year. The reason is that after collecting the accounts, whether to extend credit for more than a month of business is actually a difficult problem.</p>

<p>Definite Date for the Establishment of the County Court The county court in this county was originally scheduled to be officially established on New Year's Day.

Recently, Yao Guozhang, the secretary of the High Court, came to Wuxi and worked with County Magistrate Pan and Xia Xueqin, the county prison officer, to supervise the construction actively. It has now become quite impressive. It has been decided to officially establish it on the 20th of this month and start work on the 1st of next month. As for the position of president, Lin, the president of the High Court, has internally decided to appoint Wei Bangzhen to Wuxi. Mr. Wei is the uncle of Daoming.</p>
<p>The Silk Industry Public Debt is Issued as Scheduled Silk merchants in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai previously filed a joint petition with the government to issue a public debt of 10 million yuan to provide relief because the silk market had fallen miserably, sales were sluggish, and the silk industry was unable to maintain itself. The government appointed Zhang Shouyong, the Vice Minister of Finance, to preside over the handling. Vice Minister Zhang invited silk industry leaders from various places for careful discussion and decided to change the debt amount to 7 million yuan, with 6 million yuan to provide relief to silk merchants and 1 million yuan as a fundamental fund dedicated to improving silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Three principles were agreed upon in terms of borrowing: 1) Only those who have been working continuously from June 1, 1919 to the present are eligible to borrow money. 2) Those who have temporarily suspended operations due to the depressed market but have not dissolved or closed down are also eligible to receive debt. 3) Those who have reported to the silk industry organization that they have stopped operations or have dissolved and are unable to resume operations due to poor business are not allowed to receive money. The issuance date of the public debt has also been determined to be January 6, 1920. Vice Minister Zhang also proposed 200,000 yuan from the debt for printing debt tickets and other expenses, so the actual amount to save silk merchants is only 5.8 million yuan. The Public Debt Committee further added two principles: 1) After receiving this relief public debt, no matter what kind of debt is owed, the public debt shall not be used to repay the debt, and it must continue to operate and maintain the livelihood of the workers. In fact, it must be based on the principle of releasing smoke from the smoke dyer. 2) After receiving the public debt, from January 6 to May 31, all silk released must be deducted 20 taels of customs silver, and there must be no interruption or breach of contract. Newly opened silk mills must also be treated equally. Currently, this public debt has been circulating in the Shanghai financial market since January 6, signing checks. Silk merchants and silkworm merchants are all engaged in activities. However, immediately after the public debt was circulated, it was discovered that some people were manipulating it. It turns out that a small number of speculators have hoarded thousands of bales of factory silk and are now using the warehouse tickets as proof of receipt, as if they are mortgaging public debt with the silk that has already been reeled, and the silk mills that are in urgent need of relief do not have current silk and cannot receive money. Therefore, silk merchants in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai have realized this and agreed to unite unanimously to deal with it. As for the number of debt assignments, the local trade associations have also carefully reviewed it. It is estimated that each silk car can be assigned 140 yuan. The Wuxi Silk Factory Trade Association has handled it accordingly.</p>

Director Yao received the order and has decided to implement the demolition of hired workers on the 10th of this month, and issued a notice to all residents inside and outside the Moon City that all houses that obstruct the route must be automatically demolished within ten days, otherwise, the bureau will hire workers to carry out the demolition, and the wages will still be recovered from the owners.</p>

A police officer, Wang Haiming, was also killed by a stray bullet. After the village police reported to the county government, Zhu, an investigating judge, was dispatched on the 27th to examine the scene. After conducting medical treatment and preparing for burials separately, the patrol leader Zhou was taken to the county for questioning.

<h3>Auspicious New Year Snowfall</h3>
<p>Wind and Snow the Day Before Yesterday, Severe Cold Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, there has been rain and snow, and the weather has turned suddenly cold. Yesterday, the temperature dropped, with the indoor Fahrenheit thermometer showing only twenty-seven degrees. Several people have died from the cold. The sales of cold-weather items have surged. However, the waterways in various places have frozen over completely, resulting in a very limited supply of vegetables in the city's vegetable markets yesterday morning. Prices have increased several times compared to the past. The ice and snow on the roads are slippery, making it difficult to walk. Rickshaw pullers are experiencing great hardship. The domestic water pipes, although wrapped with straw, have not been spared from the extreme cold, and no water is flowing. Unless the pipes are heated with fire, it is difficult to get water. Automobile engines are mostly affected by the cold, with the oil and water congealing and making ignition difficult. The fire department is carefully protecting the fire engines, inspecting them at all times to avoid any emergencies.</p>
<p>The Auspicious Snowfall in This City: Since the light snowfall at 3:00 PM on New Year's Day, there have been several days of continuous cloudy and rainy weather, alternating between sunny and rainy. Until the late night of the 8th, the sky was suddenly covered with dark clouds, and the cold was intense. Before long, auspicious snow began to fall. By noon the next day, the heavy snow was flying. By the evening, a high vantage point offered a view of a silver-white world. Although the sky cleared yesterday morning, the cold was piercing, and the several inches of snow had not yet melted. Light snow fell again around 2:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Several People Frozen to Death in the Cold: A beggar was frozen to death on Caichang Street in the French Concession yesterday morning. The body was collected by the charity organization. Jia Agui, a tailor from Suzhou, a worker at a tailor shop on Xidoushi Street in Wusong, had been ill for many days. The night before last, heavy snow fell, and the night was particularly cold. When the shop owner saw that he was seriously ill, he ordered someone to carry him to the Coastal Public Hospital. When the doctor examined him, he had already died. In the Jialong Bridge area, about four li west of Wusong, an elderly villager in his late fifties was frozen to death yesterday due to the sudden cold weather. A four-year-old child in a nearby village also froze to death.</p>
<p>Train Delays Due to Cold Weather: Due to the severe cold and heavy snowfall the day before yesterday, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway trains reduced speed. As a result, the arrival of each passenger and freight train at each station was delayed by at least two to three hours.</p>
<p>Damage to Railway Power Lines: The direct telegraph and telephone lines from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway were suddenly struck and damaged in several places by wind and clouds around 11:00 PM the night before last. Therefore, communication from Shanghai to Hangzhou was cut off. Only communication between Hangzhou and Jiaxing remained normal. The stationmasters of Jiaxing and Xing immediately reported to the City Affairs Department and dispatched workers to repair the damage. Repairs were completed by 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and power was restored.</p>
<p>Pudong Ferry Service Suspended: The snow was extremely heavy in Pudong the day before yesterday. The sky cleared after 3:00 PM. Last morning, the accumulated snow was about five to six inches. Yesterday morning, the sailing ferries in Donggou, Xigou, Qingning Temple, and other places were suspended due to the strong wind and waves. Only the ferry was still running.</p>
<p>New Jiangtian Ferry Arrives Late: The New Jiangtian ferry, sailing between Ningbo and Shanghai, departed on the 9th at 4:00 PM. It did not leave the Zhenhai Kou Gorge Island until over 6:00 PM. Huge waves surged, splashing into the cabins, accumulating a foot of water. It was not until 12:00 PM that it reached the size of a galley. The ship rolled even more violently, but the sailors did their best to support it, and at 5:00 PM, it escaped the gate. However, the sea surface was covered with thick snow, a vast expanse of white, making it impossible to recognize the route. It had no choice but to drop anchor and stop. After more than ten minutes, it resumed moving slowly. At that time, it was not possible to tell where it was. After digging up the sea mud for testing, it was discovered that it was already outside Dongsha. The captain, fearing that it would touch a small reef, stopped again for forty minutes. Then, it resumed driving slowly. It was sunrise when we passed Guodongsha. It arrived at the Wusongkou at 11:00 PM, arriving at 12:00 PM. Therefore, yesterday's New Jiangtian ferry arrived very late. It was heard that the Ningxing Wheel also entered the port at the same time due to snow. Other wheels, such as Guangda and Taishun, also reported by telephone that navigation was difficult.</p>
<p>Inland Ship Navigation Blocked: Because of the severe cold and wind since the day before yesterday, the Shanghai Suzhou boats of the inland China Merchants and Yuantong, and the Huzhou boats, as well as the local ships from various places, which were to enter the Suzhou River yesterday morning, did not arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, various round bureaus received reports from small roads, saying that they encountered strong winds on the way, and the inner river was freezing, and could not travel. You have to stop along the way, wait for the wind to stop and the ice to open before coming to Shanghai. Therefore, the small wheels should have stopped going to Suhanghu yesterday, and many passengers temporarily returned.</p>
<h3>The City Center Area Plan Is About to Be Implemented</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Submits the Entire Plan to the National Government for Record</p>
<p>Construction of the New Municipal Government Building to Commence on July 7th</p>
<p>Issue a Second Municipal Public Debt to Open a New Commercial Port</p>
<p>The construction of the central area of this city is the only major undertaking to realize the Great Shanghai Plan. Since the establishment of the Municipal Center Area Construction Committee in August of the 18th year, all matters to be designed within the first phase have taken rough shape. After this, the work gradually moved towards the implementation phase. It is heard that the municipal government convened a temporary municipal meeting on December 19th of last year, specializing in discussing the realization of the city center area. In addition to Mayor Zhang and Secretary-General Yu and the heads of the various bureaus, the chairmen of the Municipal Construction Discussion Association, Yu and Qian, and the chairman of the Municipal Bank, Xu, were also invited to attend the discussion. Regarding the entire plan, it was decided to designate Secretary-General Yu and the four bureau heads, Shen, Pan, Huang, and Tang, to contact and negotiate with various financial enterprises to determine the implementation methods, and then submit them to the National Government for record. Regarding the construction of the new municipal government building, it was decided that the municipal government building would still be constructed according to the original plan. The other bureau buildings will be temporarily constructed. The total construction cost will be limited to 500,000 yuan. It was decided that the cornerstone laying ceremony for the new municipal government building would be held on July 7th, the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the municipal government. Land for the construction of the municipal government would be acquired in advance, so that the tree planting ceremony could be held there in the 20th year. Regarding the issue of opening a new commercial port, it was decided to designate Deputy Director Tang and Director Zhu to plan the implementation. The majority of public bonds will be used for the preliminary construction of the port. As for the overall development plan of the city center area, it was also decided to adopt an incentive method. The relevant bureaus will formulate separate measures and discuss them further to achieve perfection.</p>
<h3>After the Implementation of Lijin Abolition</h3>
<p>News from Various Sources</p>
<p>The abolition of Lijin was implemented from the beginning of this year. Various new tax collection methods after the abolition of Lijin will also be formulated and announced in sequence. The impact on commerce from this change of old and new tax rules is significant. Based on what Xin Sheng News Agency has learned from various sources, the relevant news is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs on Equal Abolition: The regular customs under the direct jurisdiction of the Jianghai Customs, located fifty li outside the Customs, have been abolished. There are eight locations in total: ㈠ Tongru, ㈡ Haimen, ㈢ Chongqi, ㈣ Huangjiagang, ㈤ Huliu, ㈥ Jiangyin, ㈦ Qingjiang, ㈧ Menghe. The locations are all along the river and coast. In the Qing Dynasty, they were jointly managed by the Su-Song-Tai Shanghai Taoist official. In the first year of the Republic of China, a special Jianghai Customs Superintendent was established, and all regular customs outside fifty li were also inspected by the Superintendent. The tax revenue of the eight customs divisions was only 60,000 Qian Wen in the late Qing Dynasty. In the first year of the Republic of China, Superintendent Bing Xie implemented a system of full collection and delivery, which increased to 240,000 silver dollars by the sixth year. In the eighth year, Superintendent Yao Yu further rectified the system, increasing revenue to over 310,000 silver dollars. The Ministry of Finance set 310,000 silver dollars as the quota. Subsequently, Superintendent Yao was planning to revise the tax rules and reorganize them, but the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War occurred, and the plan was not completed. Later, Superintendent Zhu Youji, during his tenure, tried to reorganize the system, increased public expenses, eliminated embezzlement, and increased revenue to 620,000 silver dollars. After the establishment of the National Government, the tax rules were supplemented and the quota was verified as 744,000 silver dollars, which has been followed until now. Each superintendent in the past years has collected to the full amount, or more. In recent years, cloth has been exempted from tax for offset purposes, and wheat has been exempted from tax for offset purposes due to the establishment of a special tax on wheat flour. Except for these two offset items, the cash collection can reach 160% to 170% of the quota. This time, it was ordered to abolish the regular customs outside fifty li on January 1, 1931, and to completely close them within half a month. All remaining tickets, funds, and official documents and other official items of each branch customs will be handed over to the Superintendent's office for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Lu and Gan Both Support Lijin Abolition: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from Sun Lianzhong, stating that he would sincerely support and be optimistic about its success. Lu Dipin of Jiangxi also sent a telegram, stating that subsidies have been approved by the Provincial Affairs Conference, hoping that the whole country would unanimously support the implementation of new construction.</p>
<p>Foreign Goods Should Avoid Double Taxation: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the Xiamen General Chamber of Commerce, with the main points being that after this Lijin abolition, the sub-port tax has also been abolished. In the future, for imported foreign goods, in addition to paying import duties according to the new tax rules, foreign goods that meet the items subject to consumption tax should be subject to consumption tax uniformly. The Outline for the Implementation of Special Consumption Tax, decided by the Lijin Abolition Committee, does not have any explicit provisions. As for regular customs duties within fifty li, there should be no reason for overlapping payments.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Business Tax Rates: Cosmetics industry peers believe that the business tax levied in Jiangsu Province, according to the outline, has increased the tax rate by a large amount, ten times higher. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied from the Ministry, saying that it was a rumor.</p>
<p>Bao Xing Refunds Raw Material Tax: The Silk and Satin Trade Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce suggesting that the government should re-levy import duties on foreign silk and satin to make up for the difference, and requested that the raw material tax be refunded when levying commodity taxes, in order to conform to the system of one tax per item and never levy it again. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied that the currently announced import tax rate for silk and satin is 45% ad valorem, which is the highest tax rate in the current tax law. This tax law has just been passed and announced by the Yuan, and there is no reason to change it suddenly. The suggestion will not be discussed for the time being. As for the refund of raw material tax when levying commodity taxes, the Special Consumption Tax Outline formulated by the Ministry and the resolution of the Five Provinces Lijin Abolition Conference both have provisions. If another suggestion is made, it seems to deny the existence of the original resolution, which would give officials an excuse to overturn the original resolution. Therefore, the Chamber believes that the latter level should be based on the original plan and pay attention to whether the officials can implement it. There is no need to make suggestions again at this time.</p>
<p>Abolish Inspection and Taxation: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the Fujian Province created a firecracker import inspection office, which requires 40 cents per 10,000 firecrackers for inspection fees. According to the value of firecrackers, each 10,000 firecrackers are sold for at most one Taiwan dollar, and as little as 70 to 80 cents. This import inspection tax rate of more than 50% is unaffordable, and the manufacturing raw materials, such as nitrate, sulfur, and paper, have been included in special taxes. The nature of the import inspection and tax collection fee is similar to Lijin. At this time when Lijin abolition is being strictly implemented, the outline of Lijin abolition and the conversion of special consumption tax has been clearly announced item by item. There is no need for disguised import inspection and tax collection of Lijin to occur, which would impose a double burden on merchants and lose the merit of the new policy. It is requested that the Ministry order the abolition of the practice to maintain commerce.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Finance Bureau Ends the Borrowing and Collection of Rent</h3>
<p>Approximately 2.9 Million Yuan Collected</p>
<p>Decision on How to Exchange Bonds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau was ordered by the Municipal Government last year to raise funds by borrowing and collecting rent against bonds. The Bureau issued a circular and the work ended at the end of December of the 19th year of the Republic. Each collection office has submitted the total amount collected to the Finance Bureau. The South District collected approximately 1.5 million yuan, the North District approximately 1.2 million yuan, the East District approximately 100,000 yuan, and the West District several tens of thousands of yuan, for a total of approximately 2.9 million yuan. Previously, there was a problem with the small change for the bonds. The Finance Bureau has now formulated a method, which has been approved by the Municipal Government. The method is to issue a small one-yuan ticket to each store with small change. The change below one yuan will still be returned to the residents. As for the one-yuan ticket, if the residents want to combine several households to form five yuan or ten yuan, they can still exchange it for bonds. As for the issuance method, a receipt was temporarily issued to each resident when the rent was collected. Now each resident must exchange the receipt for a formal receipt from the Finance Bureau, and then exchange the receipt for bonds from the bank. However, the method and collection report are currently being compiled by the Finance Bureau and will be announced and implemented before the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Large Loans to China from the UK, USA and Canada</h3>
<p>The Three Countries Will Jointly Invest 100 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Canadian Minister to Japan Has Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Negotiations Were Conducted with Wang Zhengting Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Canadian Minister to Japan Maher arrived in Shanghai on the Empress of Japan from Kobe during the New Year and stayed at the Cathay Hotel. Canada has not sent a minister to China. This is Maher's second visit to China. According to news obtained by this newspaper from various sources, Maher's trip is actually related to the large loans to China from the UK, USA, and Canada. Minister Maher has been discussing in detail with Canadian Trade Commissioner to Shanghai, Cosgrove. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, he went to the Foreign Affairs Discussion Council at Fenglin Bridge to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting for about half an hour. Minister Maher will enter Beijing after receiving instructions from the Canadian government to conduct concrete negotiations with government officials. The motive for the three countries' investment in China, which is said to be 200 million pounds, is to save the key to the world's commercial decline, which depends on revitalizing the Chinese market. Due to the impact of the high price of gold and the low price of silver, China's purchasing power has been greatly affected. The trade between the countries and China has therefore plummeted. The motive for the large loans to China from the three countries is to remedy this decline. According to a Tokyo telegram from the Japanese United News Agency, Canadian newspapers reported that Canadian Minister to Japan Tokugawa Iesato reported that Canadian Minister to Japan Maher is now in China negotiating the sale of millions of bags of Canadian wheat to China. Canadian Minister of Commerce Stevens is negotiating with British and American capitalists to develop China's general economic situation and restore the price of silver, with the aim of organizing a long-term loan of 100 million yuan to China from the UK, USA, and Canada. Canada will supply wheat, and the UK and USA will sell railway machinery to China. Minister Tokugawa met with Minister of Commerce Stevens on the 5th to inquire about the matter. Minister of Commerce Stevens clarified that it is true that Minister to Japan Maher went to Nanjing to negotiate the sale of wheat.</p>

In particular, the members discussed the former issue repeatedly and in detail, and found many doubts in the contract signed between the Public Works Department and the Water Company. It was decided to invite Committee Members Lin Kanghou and Chu Huiseng, together with five expert committee members, including Dong Xiujia, He Dekui, Zhang Xinglian, Xia Jinlin, and Tao Leqin, to conduct a careful study, prepare a draft, and submit it to the next regular meeting for decision, and then send letters to the Ministry and the Chinese committee members to pay attention to the negotiations.</p>
<h3>Director Yuan Returns to Work</h3>
<p>He Took Leave Early Due to the Importance of Local Defense</p>
<p>Director Yuan of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau previously requested a month's leave from the mayor for recuperation due to illness. Now, due to the importance of defense during the winter defense period, he took leave early. The document submitted to the Municipal Government stated that Director Yuan previously requested a month's leave due to illness, and all duties were temporarily delegated to Chief Inspector Wang Yufen.

He should comply with the order and return to work immediately, in order to avoid neglecting important matters. In addition to notifying the outside, the reasons for taking leave early are hereby submitted for review. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Zhang.</p>

<h3>Xu Amei and Others, Executive Committee Members of the French Power and Electrical Workers Union, are Dismissed</h3>
<p>The Civil Training Council Ordered an Investigation</p>
<p>The National Society reports that on the afternoon of New Year's Eve (31st), the copper workers of the French Concession Power and Electrical Workers Union demanded a year-end bonus from the factory, taking advantage of the holidays of the party and government organs. They went on strike suddenly, but resumed work the next day. The Civil Training Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Committee immediately sent personnel to investigate and found that the strike was obviously instigated by Xu Amei, Zhang Amao, Zhang Qixiang, and Wang Agen, four executive committee members of the union. The Civil Training Council was greatly angered by this situation and felt that the four, as members of the union, did not understand the situation and were not worthy of being role models for the members. Therefore, it has ordered the union to immediately remove the four from their positions as committee members. It is also heard that Xu Amei's position as a preparatory committee member of the Power and Electrical Industry Union Federation has also been submitted to the Executive Committee of the Municipal Party Committee for removal.</p>
<h3>Special Tax Commissioners Host a Banquet for Classmates</h3>
<p>This time, the Ministry of Finance transferred customs personnel to investigate the tax revenue of various provinces and handle special tax matters. The investigation work of these members was completed at the end of last year, so they gathered in Shanghai during the New Year's holiday and were coerced by the members of the Tax Tariff Committee to collect the various types of tax from the members of the Japan Silk Association, including the fixed tax rate for goose, book, oil, down, porcelain, captive and all kinds of other taxes.</p>
<p>The meeting was convened for several days, and new tax rules for silk, cotton, oil paper, and porcelain were formulated. The meeting was completed on the 9th. The Special Tax Commissioners who conducted the investigation, including Qiu Zhuoqi, Zhang Yongnian, Ma Qishan, Pan Xueyu, Li Pengshou, Wang Huamin, Jiang Chensheng, Hong Changjian, and Ren Raoxiang, hosted a banquet for Shanghai tax school classmates at the Datong Restaurant, with more than 70 people attending. Mr. Qiu reported on the purpose of the banquet, and then Mr. Pan Xueyu described the difficulties of the investigation and the hopes and dangers of future work. Outsiders do not understand the truth and regard the special tax agency as a newly established good position, but they do not know that the personnel who were transferred this time are all complaining. They worked hard and complained, and the future heavy responsibilities are even more daunting. However, this matter is related to the reputation of all tax school classmates and affects the future of national tax revenue. We can only do our best to move forward, rectify tax affairs, and live up to the hopes of the country and the encouragement of the classmates.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Establishes Issuance Reserve Inspection Committee</h3>
<p>First Inspection</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications has organized an inspection committee for its issuance reserves, employing accountant Yan Ouke to conduct a public inspection. On the 9th of this month, the first meeting for inspecting the issuance reserves was held. The inspection report is attached hereafter. Since 1923, the bank's banknotes have followed the Bank of England's approach, establishing a reserve warehouse completely separate from regular operations, stipulating a reserve composition of 60% cash and 40% securities. The results are remarkable. Now, taking a further step to voluntarily disclose this information further demonstrates the bank's commitment to serving society and its pragmatic approach, which is truly a blessing for the economic sector. "The Bank of Communications Shanghai District Main Vault First Inspection of Exchange Certificate Issuance Amount and Reserve Amount (December 31, 1930)." Exchange certificate issuance amount: 40,636,649 yuan. Cash reserve amount: 24,531,529 yuan. Guarantee reserve amount: 16,100,562 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tax Academy Alumni Celebration</h3>
<p>The Peiping Tax Academy has been established for nearly twenty years, with graduates assigned to serve in customs offices across the country each year, with remarkable results. Recently, many of the specialists sent by the Ministry of Finance to various countries to investigate customs administration, and those transferred to the ministry to handle special tax affairs, are graduates of this academy. Since the establishment of the Shanghai office of the Inspectorate General of Customs, the number of tax academy alumni in Shanghai has steadily increased. Every New Year, the alumni hold a gathering, inviting alumni family members and children to participate. This year's gathering was held on January 2nd at Yipinxiang Restaurant. Because specialists handling special tax investigations and others were in Shanghai for a conference to establish special tax regulations, the number of attendees was greater than in previous years, with a total of over 240 alumni and family members. Starting at 2:00 PM, alumni performed skits. After the skits, prizes were distributed to the children, followed by a banquet and group photo before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Chinese Chemical Industry Society Visits Jiu Fu Pharmaceutical Factory</h3>
<p>The Jiu Fu Company of this city is a giant in the new drug manufacturing industry. All products are based on scientific formulas, utilizing new machinery and meticulous preparation. The facilities are complete, and the scale is grand. In the pharmaceutical industry of our country, it can be described as unique. In the interest of academic research and open manufacturing, the company has welcomed visits from various sectors on several occasions, and there have been frequent requests from groups for dedicated tours. The Chinese Chemical Industry Society on Baille Road in this city is an academic organization of chemical researchers in our country. It had determined that the annual meeting would include visits to major factories. As Jiu Fu Company has abundant facilities, the members were eager to visit to broaden their knowledge. Therefore, they arranged with the company in advance to visit the factory on January 5th. At the designated time, Chairman Cao Liangxia of Datong University, technician Wu YunChu of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Cai Xiying of Yifeng Factory, Shao Liti of Zhenhua Factory, Xiao Xiangang, and others, along with dozens of members, arrived at the Jiu Fu Company manufacturing plant for the tour. Deputy Manager Chen Xingwu, chemist Shen Jichuan, and others led the tour of the various manufacturing workshops. At that time, because the market demand for Buli Duo and other products was huge, they were all in production, so those who visited the various departments were able to understand the manufacturing procedures of each department. Especially the machines for manufacturing Buli Duo were very innovative. Even in European and American imported pharmaceutical factories, it was no more than this, which was deeply appreciated by the visiting members.</p>

<h3>Assassin of Chen Qimei Will Not Escape Justice</h3>
<p>Two of Four Accomplices Have Been Arrested</p>
<p>Nie Dianbang Had Been Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Taken Away by Zhang Zongchang's Troops</p>
<p>Arrested on Chongqing Road on the Sixth of This Month</p>
<p>Referred Back to Prison by the Local Court</p>
<p>Revolutionary martyr Chen Qimei, after leaving the post of Shanghai Military Governor, lived in seclusion at No. 14, Route Saepee, in the French Concession. In the fifth year of the Republic, Yuan Shikai's desire to restore the monarchy grew daily, fearing opposition from Southern Party members. At the time, it was rumored that he secretly sent warriors to the south to assassinate Chen. Tragically, Mr. Chen was murdered at his residence around 4 PM on May 18th of that year. The murderer escaped on the spot. The case has remained unsolved for fifteen years, becoming a mystery. However, after the New Year this year, the old case was suddenly brought up again. A Shandong native named Nie Dianbang, residing at No. 603 Chongqing Road, was discovered by Zhang Jingqing, the District Chief of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Province River Police, to be the assassin of Chen. On the morning of the 6th, at 11:00 AM, District Chief Zhang sent detective Zhang Zhaoxiang to the Local Court of the Special District to deliver a transfer letter and request an arrest warrant in order to arrest him. While traveling to Chongqing Road, he saw Nie coming towards him. Unable to go to the court to request the arrest warrant, he reported to the sentry post, number 1249, who took Nie into the police station. After investigation by the police chief, it was learned that the suspect had previously been sentenced to six months in the western prison for private trafficking of military supplies. He was ordered to be detained, and Detective Zhang went to the Shanghai Local Court to request the Chief Prosecutor to issue an arrest warrant and transferred the document to the Special District Court for extradition. The next morning, the police station transferred Nie to the Special Court, where Judge Ge Zhiqin held a hearing. In addition to the bailiff dispatched by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate, the municipal government and the Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent officials to the court at the request of the authorities in the Chinese area. Police station lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that after the defendant was detained at the police station, the police chief inquired with the French police, as the case occurred in the French Concession, whether they had apprehended any suspects. The reply was that the case had not been solved and that the current suspect was the first to be apprehended. The police station would not object to extradition as long as there was an official document from a formal judicial authority. When questioning Nie Dianbang, he stated that he had gone to Little Luzon in the third month of the fifth year of the Republic and did not participate in the assassination of Chen, and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. After Judge Ge completed the interrogation, he ordered Nie Dianbang to be taken away by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate to be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<p>According to another source, when Hong Xian restored the monarchy, Chen Qimei promoted independence in Shanghai, which was severely restricted by Yuan Shikai. Afterwards, the Shanghai Prosecutor's Office apprehended the murderer Nie Zhenbang and sent him to the trial court, which sentenced him to life imprisonment. The Prosecutor's Office disagreed and filed an appeal. When Zhang Zongchang was in power, he sent troops to take Nie away, and there was no news of him since. It has now been discovered that the murderer Nie Zhenbang, under the alias Dianbang, has been in Shanghai for several days and was apprehended by the Public Concession Police. The Shanghai Procuratorate has prepared a document to request the Special District Court to send him back to prison, as the case has already been judged and executed in the mainland. Yesterday, Zhang Jingqing, District Chief of the Water Police Fourth District, telegraphed Chairman Jiang of the National Government, Central Committee Member Chen Lifu, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Security Force, the Department of Finance, and submitted a report to the Shanghai Municipal Government. It is said that there are four accomplices in this case. One, Wu Baoxian, has already been detained by the court in another case and sentenced to ten months in prison. He will need to be brought in for questioning in the future. The other two accomplices are currently being investigated.</p>
<h3>Public Concession</h3>
<p>Limits Closure of Two Dog Racing Tracks</p>
<p>Not Allowed to Race After the End of March</p>
<p>Shanghai's dog racing tracks have been disguised gambling dens, long resented by the people of Shanghai. The Public Concession Municipal Council has recently been pressured by public opinion to take action, but there is still no hope of a complete ban. However, Mr. Feixin Dun, Director-General of the Council, suddenly wrote to the Zhongyuan and Mingyuan dog racing tracks in the concession a few days ago, ordering them to close by the end of March of this year. This has brought joy to the people, and it is hoped that the Yiyuan dog racing track in the French Concession can follow suit. According to the Greater Shanghai Evening News, the French Concession authorities intend to close the Yiyuan because the Public Concession authorities have decided to close the Shenyuan and Mingyuan dog racing tracks on a specific date. However, the method has not yet been announced. If this is the case, the dog racing tracks in Shanghai can hopefully be completely banned soon. The letters sent by Mr. Fei to Shenyuan and Mingyuan were the same, with only one or two words slightly different. The letter stated that the Municipal Council had previously warned the dog racing tracks, but the parks had disregarded the warning and were doubling the number of races per session, gradually abolishing the practice of entrance fees, and widely distributing preferential tickets and advertising, intending to expand a gambling medium for Chinese residents in the concession. The Municipal Council and the British authorities in this city have recently notified the directors of the dog racing tracks, stating that because Chinese residents oppose this kind of gambling being imported into Shanghai, the problem, aside from other objectionable points, has become serious in the political situation. Recent developments have made the situation more urgent. Therefore, the Municipal Council has resolutely decided that, for the public interest, there is no other way but to prohibit it immediately. This decision has been fully agreed and supported by the British Consul authorities in this city. After March 31st of this year, dog racing will no longer be allowed in the Public Concession. The Municipal Council intends to lease the property of Shenyuan and Mingyuan. If employees have individual difficulties, the Municipal Council intends to consider them.</p>
<h3>Fire Chief Dies Tragically at Railroad Crossing Without Gate</h3>
<p>Liu Rongtai Drives to Put Out Fire</p>
<p>Hit Hard by Train En Route</p>
<p>Car Smashed, Liu Dies</p>
<p>Death in the Line of Duty is Lamentable</p>
<p>At the Gonghe Xin Road railroad crossing in Zhabei, at 10:47 PM last night (the 9th), the 22nd Beijing-Shanghai express train coming from Beijing collided with and destroyed the personal car of Liu Rongtai, captain of the Third Section Fire Brigade. Captain Liu died in the line of duty. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Photo of Car After Being Hit Hard by Train</p>

<p>Taken by Keming Photo Studio on North Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Incident: Around 10 PM last night, in freezing weather, a fire alarm was reported at You Jin Ji Cotton Warehouse on Hanzhong Road. Upon hearing the report, Liu Rongtai, captain of the Third Section Fire Brigade, drove his own car, Municipal Permit No. 5933, Concession Permit No. 3642, to the scene. When driving through the gate crossing, the 7th Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo night train was passing by, followed by the 22nd Beijing-Shanghai express train. The 7th Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo night train usually passed at 9:30 PM, but it was delayed due to the cold and snow. The tracks there consist of a double track and three lines. The southern track is dedicated to freight trains and only runs from the North Station to the Macken Road Station. The middle track is the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo track, and the northern track is the Beijing-Shanghai track. The gate on the Beijing-Shanghai middle track was damaged by a railway artillery vehicle and has not been repaired, so there was no gate to block it. Liu's car drove straight through, unexpectedly being hit hard by the train, flying onto the grass dozens of feet outside the track. The car shattered like snowflakes. Nearby residents only heard a crash. No one came out to look due to the cold. Around 11 PM, the police from the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau discovered it. Seeing that there was no Chinese permit on the car, they suspected it was a Concession car and immediately called the Public Concession Fire Brigade, dispatching a Westerner named Tingding (transliteration) and others in a car. The Westerner recognized Liu as the captain of the Third Section Fire Brigade. The Westerner reported to the brigade, and a fire truck was sent to the scene. Members Chen Shaoji, Zheng Huitian, Yang Xiuzhi, Ma Shiqi, and others took him to Baolong Hospital, but he had already died. The body was transported back to the Third Section Fire Brigade on Hongjiang Road.</p>
<p>Background of the Deceased: The deceased, named Zhushi, courtesy name Rongtai, was 36 years old, from Nanhai County, Guangdong. In the fifth year of the Republic, he joined the Third Section Fire Brigade as a volunteer member. In the ninth year, he became an instructor for the Public Concession Fire Brigade. Later, he returned to Guangzhou to serve as the captain of the fire brigade. In the fifteenth year, he returned to Shanghai. In the sixteenth year, the fire brigade was destroyed by artillery fire. Through Liu's hard work, the brigade's affairs were gradually restored to their original state. Liu had one wife and one concubine. His wife, Li, was 32 years old, and his concubine, Zhou, was 31 years old. He had a son named Shaoji, who is currently ten years old and studying in a primary school in Guangdong. Liu worked as a manager at the Losheng Foreign Firm on Tianzhang Road during the day and lived at No. 2 Lexing Li, Qiujiang Road. It is understood that the brigade believes that Liu's sudden death has left the brigade without a leader. Therefore, a special emergency meeting was held last night, and Deputy Captain Chen Shaoji was publicly elected as captain. It was also decided that a grand funeral would be held for the late Captain Liu on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Patrolman Cheng Juliang Lucky to Survive Gunshot to Vital Area</h3>
<p>Thugs Open Fire to Rob Box Cannon</p>
<p>Bullet Hits Cheng's Magazine Pouch</p>
<p>Bullet Ricochets, No Skin Wound</p>
<p>Three Thugs Caught in Hotel</p>
<p>Attached: North Fourth District Patrolman Cheng Xueliang, an Anhui native, was assigned to post No. 18 at the intersection of Xinmin Road and Beinannanli on the night of the 2nd of this month. After 2:00 AM, two thugs in military uniform approached and asked Patrolman Cheng where the railway overpass was. As the patrolman was raising his hand to point in the direction, Thug A drew a pistol from his sleeve and fired a shot at the patrolman's chest and abdomen. Thug A was only a foot away from Patrolman Cheng when he fired. Fortunately, Patrolman Cheng was wearing a Mauser pistol belt around his waist, fully loaded with magazine clips, each clip containing five bullets, arranged in order. The thug's bullet hit Patrolman Cheng's magazine clip, with great force, triggering the bullets in the patrolman's magazine. The medicine exploded, ricocheting out and hitting the second, third, and fourth magazine clips, firing a total of five bullets. Luckily, the bullets ricocheted out and did not wound the skin. When the patrolman drew his gun to return fire, the thugs had already fled. The patrolman immediately ran back to the station to report. Chief Yao immediately led officers and police to inspect travelers at various hotels and inns. They checked room No. 25 of the Huaxing Hotel on North Zhejiang Road and saw a traveler sleeping in the bed. A military uniform was hanging on the clothes rack, along with a weapons belt. They questioned the traveler, who claimed to be Xu Huaichen and said the military uniform was his. Upon taking down the uniform, they checked the attached symbol, which read Fang Dunyuan. They interrogated the traveler again, who claimed the uniform belonged to his friend, Fang Dunyuan, who had gone to the North Station Hotel. The officers and police went to the hotel to search, but found nothing. They took Xu back to the station. The next day, Patrolman Cheng, while guarding on the road, apprehended a thug who had asked him about the overpass that night and took him to the station for questioning. It was Fang Dunyuan. When questioned, he confessed that there was also a military attendant, Zhou, living in the Jiangsu Hotel. Detectives then apprehended Zhou at the station. Patrolman Cheng identified Zhou as the thug who had fired the gun that night. A letter from Ning was found on Fang, which read: "Dear Mr. Dunyuan, the large-sized goods have a good market and sell for about 170 yuan. Although the small-sized goods have been sold, they have been returned due to poor quality. If you have large-sized goods, please send them immediately." Judging from the wording of the letter, it seems to be trafficking in pistols. That night, the thugs opened fire, intending to rob Patrolman Cheng's Mauser pistol. The three thugs have been sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The symbols worn by Fang and Zhou read Huai Xuhai Guerrilla Headquarters, one being a battalion deputy and the other an aide. The troops had already been disbanded.</p>
<h3>How Grand! Yang Zhifu Departs for Tibet</h3>
<p>This Trip is Scheduled for Five Years</p>
<p>Will Not Return from Tibet Until He Dies</p>
<p>Yang Zhifu, a Qinghai native, is fluent in Tibetan and was a lama at Xuantung Temple for three years. Last spring, he went to Beijing to work as an editor at the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission and as a professor at the Tibetan Primary School of the Central Political University. He now plans to go to Qingkang Tibet to investigate religion and culture and promote the Three Principles of the People. He recently came to Shanghai to purchase many books and instruments. Fellow members of the China Borderland Society in Shanghai, Sheng Chenglin, Huang Jingwan, Zou Guotai, Huang Yue of the Northeast Immigration and Reclamation Corps, Wang Jin Yuan of the Kangzang Walking Group, Shen Xingchu of the Yousheng Travel Group, and others, jointly hosted a banquet at the Sichuan Restaurant. After the banquet, they took a photo at the Wang Kai Photo Studio as a memento. Yesterday morning, Mr. Yang braved the snow and departed from the North Station. Before leaving, he agreed with his Shanghai friends that the trip would last five years and vowed not to return from Tibet until he died. The principals of Shanghai universities and various newspapers in the city all asked him to send correspondence and photos at any time, and to collect natural history specimens, models, and ethnic living supplies along the way. After arriving in Beijing, he plans to travel west with Ling Ziwei, Tian Kunshan, Wang Jiyun of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, and Gao Yumen of National Central University to Qinghai, and then invite Chen Yaotang and Liu Dengkui to enter Tibet.</p>
<h3>Nine Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>Robbed in Huangpu River</p>
<p>Three Ships Have Been Released</p>
<p>Whereabouts of the Remaining Unknown</p>
<p>A total of nine Chongming merchant ships, including Zhuang Changshun, Jin Hongli, Jin Fuli, Lu Dian Ship, Ying Chengxing, Quanxing, Dexing, Shan Deyuan, Zhang Deli, and Xie Xing, loaded with southern goods, coal, iron, government salt, and other goods, were moored on the Huangpu River at the Wusong Town Outer Ma Road Lifesaving Wharf on the night of December 31st, waiting for dawn to export. Suddenly, more than a hundred bandits, piloting sampan boats and armed with weapons, swarmed onto the ships, ordering silence and forcing the crew to raise anchor and head towards Sanjiaoshui, their whereabouts unknown. The three ships that were robbed the other day, Ying Chengxing, Shan Deyuan, and Xie Xing, have been released by the bandits. Most of the goods have been looted, and ship owners A Ming, Song Changfu, Shen Guisheng, and others have been kidnapped, demanding payment for ransom. The whereabouts of the remaining ships are still unknown. When the incident occurred, the Public Security Bureau's water patrol team's Junhe patrol ship in the vicinity was unaware of the situation. It is said that the total value of the goods loaded on the looted ships is about 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>He Chuxiang Angrily Kills Wife</h3>
<p>Forced to Sell Wife for 170 Yuan</p>
<p>Rumors Spread After the Fact, Shame and Regret Combined</p>
<p>Carrying a Suicide Note, Planned to Die With His Wife</p>
<p>He Described His Life in a Miserable State</p>
<p>He Chuxiang, a Shaoxing native, 32 years old, married a woman named Hu, 25 years old. They lived together at No. 526 Jiangjiaqiao, Connaught Road. Hu's mother, Chen, also lived with them. Recently, He lost his job and stayed at home, and the couple gradually became estranged. Hu wanted to leave him. The mother and daughter colluded and secretly discussed the matter with Chen Tianlin, a Shaoxing native, agreeing to be Chen's wife. On December 28th of last year, they forced He to go to room No. 14 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road and invited Chen Tianlin to the scene, produced a bill of sale, and forced He to sign, selling Hu to Chen as his wife. Chen gave 170 yuan as the price. He was initially unwilling to sign, but seeing that many of those accompanying Chen were not good people, he did not dare to resist and reluctantly made a mark. He took the money and left unhappily, paying off old debts. Little remained. From then on, he spent nights in small inns and ate at small restaurants. He heard his mother-in-law spreading rumors about selling his wife, which made him feel even more ashamed and gave rise to the idea of killing his wife. He then found out that Chen lived at No. 248 Qipu Road. On New Year's Eve, he bought opium and shochu, drank them one after another to build courage, and then bought a sharp knife, hid it, and went to Chen's house. He went straight to Chen's room upstairs. At that time, Chen was sleeping during the day, and Hu was sitting on the edge of the bed. He unexpectedly took out the knife and stabbed her throat and abdomen, blood spurting out like a fountain. She fell to the ground in pain. Chen was awakened, jumped up, captured He, and called the police, who arrested him and took him to the Hongkou police station. Four suicide notes were found on his person, one to the police station, one to the court, one to his family He Jiaxiang, and one to his brother-in-law Hu Yushu. The wording of the four letters was similar, all saying that Hu and her mother, Chen, were unconscionable and forced a family to separate, which made him angry and led to this action. The police chief ordered He to be detained, and the injured woman was sent to the hospital for treatment, but the injury was fatal. She died at 6:00 PM on the 3rd of this month. The body was sent to the coroner's office by the police. The Special District Court sent a prosecutor to the office on the 5th to verify the cause of death and ordered Chen Tianlin to claim the coffin for burial. Yesterday morning, the police summoned witnesses and sent He to the Special Court, where Judge Feng Shide held a hearing. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for murder and submitted the four suicide notes and the murder weapon found on He's person to the court for inspection. According to He Chuxiang's confession, the deceased was hired by me when she was 13 years old, married at 17. She was my sister's husband's niece, arranged by my sister's husband. It was a match between relatives. It has been nine years since we married, and we had five children, but they all died young. I used to be employed by a Japanese merchant, earning 50 or 60 yuan a month, but recently I have been unemployed for a long time, and it is really difficult to make ends meet. Therefore, the deceased returned to her mother's home in Shaoxing after suffering the pain of losing her sight last year. She rarely came to Shanghai and stayed with her sister, wanting to divorce me, saying that I was poor and unable to share her suffering. I earnestly tried to persuade her, but from then on, we became estranged. Around May, I borrowed 10 yuan from someone, rented a house on Connaught Road, and took the deceased to live with me. At that time, my mother-in-law also came to Shanghai. The deceased then went to work in a factory, but still mentioned divorce from time to time. In October, she suddenly stopped working, saying that she was going to have an affair with someone. I advised her not to do this shameless thing, but she said why not divorce me. Later, her sister introduced her to Chen Tianlin. Then she did not return home for several nights. When asked where she was staying, she openly admitted to staying in a hotel with someone, but did not mention Chen. She threatened me, and my mother-in-law Hu Chen also ridiculed me, telling me to be a cuckold, otherwise her daughter would file for divorce. So I temporarily tolerated it. On November 17th, the deceased's mother had already returned to Shaoxing, and I accompanied Chen to welcome her back to Shanghai. They made a plan, tricked me into going to the hotel, and forced me to sign the wife-selling contract. Afterwards, they spread rumors everywhere, ruining my reputation, which forced me to take this drastic action. According to Hu Chen's confession, she did not know Chen Tianlin. This time, the defendant sent a letter saying that my daughter was sick, so I came to Shanghai. I was also temporarily ordered to sign the contract.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Much of the confession was evasive. According to Chen Tianlin's confession, he worked as a clerk in a foreign firm. I bought the defendant's wife as my wife. A matchmaker introduced us beforehand, and there was initially no ambiguity. Finally, after debate between the police lawyer and the defendant's volunteer lawyer, the court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Refinery Accounting Office</h3>
<p>Murdered for Money</p>
<p>Chopped with a Hatchet</p>
<p>Large Sum of Cash and Silver Dollars Stolen</p>
<p>The Jinglian (Refinery) Company, located at No. 431 Wuhua Road in East Shanghai, specializes in dyeing and refining silk and cloth using machinery. Xu Kuijun, the company's accountant, was 58 years old and from Dongshan, Dongting. All money entering and leaving the company passed through his hands. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, he was suddenly murdered in his bedroom. At the same time, over 3,400 silver dollars and banknotes disappeared from the accounting office's silver chest. Upon receiving the report, Chief Zhang of the Fifth District, Third Precinct Public Security Bureau immediately ordered detectives to investigate. Two suspects, Yang Awu and Zhang Shuichuan, have been arrested and sent to the court for review. Xu Kuijun had been in charge of accounting at the company for over ten years. His bedroom was separated from the accounting office by only one wall. On the morning of the 4th, the tea room attendants went to clean the accounting office and his bedroom and suddenly saw the silver chest wide open. Xu's bed was covered in blood, and he had been lightly hacked to death. They immediately ran to inform Manager Chen Dexin, who reported it to the police. An investigation revealed that Xu had been wounded by three hatchet blows to the head and five to the neck. The count of the silver chest revealed that more than 3,700 silver dollars and banknotes were missing. However, another large iron box had not been opened. The subsequent investigation revealed that the motive was indeed murder for money, and the night watchman, Yang Awu, from Dongting, 37 years old, and the doorman, Zhang Shuichuan, from Henan, 42 years old, were both suspected, especially Yang. The police found a short cloth shirt with bloodstains on the cuffs inside his bedding, as well as a rag stained with blood. The murder weapon, a hatchet, was found in the carpenter's shed in the fifth courtyard. It had been washed with water after the murder, leaving bloodstains only on the handle. There were originally two iron boxes in the accounting office. One that was opened still contained 500 silver dollars, which were entrusted by the deceased's friend and wrapped in newspapers. These were not stolen. Xu Jufang, the deceased's son, and his family lived upstairs in Xu's bedroom. At around 2:00 AM on the 4th, it seemed that strange noises were heard coming from Xu's bedroom downstairs. Xu Kuijun's body was examined on the afternoon of the 4th by Prosecutor Zhao from the court, coroner, and others. It was confirmed that he had been fatally wounded by a hatchet that severed his neck.</p>
<h3>Murder Case on Zixia Road</h3>
<p>Li Yao Shi Strangled</p>
<p>Cash and Gold Jewelry Gone</p>
<p>Li Bolu, from Haiyan, 65 years old, had been working at the Juyuansheng bean and wheat shop at No. 157 Doushi Street in Nanshi. His wife, Hu, had passed away many years ago. Li remarried Yao Shi as his second wife. Yao Shi was 52 years old this year. Li's previous wife had left behind a son and a daughter. The daughter, Lan Zhen, 16 years old, lived with her parents at No. 3 Xingyou Lane on Zixia Road outside Dadongmen. The son, Yan Sheng, lived separately in their hometown and was already married with a son named Shu De, who was 22 years old. Shu De had a rebellious nature, associating only with hooligans and indulging in depravity. Therefore, all relatives and others did not value him. Although Yan Sheng had repeatedly admonished him, Shu De turned a deaf ear and continued to neglect his proper occupation and indulge in absurdity. Yan Sheng, seeing this situation, was extremely angry and expelled Shu De, denying the father-son relationship. After leaving home, Shu De wandered alone, destitute and unable to survive. He had no choice but to join the military, and it has been four years since. However, Shu De's character has not changed at all, so the salary he receives is still not enough to cover his personal expenses. Sometimes he comes to Shanghai and still stays with his grandfather, Li Bolu. The grandparents have long despised this unfilial grandson, so they often give him the cold shoulder. On the morning of January 3rd this year, at around 10:00 AM, Shu De suddenly came to Li Bolu's place with a friend, wearing a uniform and armed with a belt. After having lunch together, he said that he had to stay overnight. Bolu was not happy to see Shu De coming home with a friend and causing trouble. At around 2:00 PM, Bolu took Lan Zhen to a movie theater in Xiaodongmen to watch a movie to relieve his boredom. Only Yao Shi, Shu De, and his friend were left at home. By around 5:00 PM in the evening, Bolu and his daughter had finished watching the movie and returned home. Shu De and his friend were gone, and Yao Shi was nowhere to be found. They then searched the kitchen and found a corpse lying on the ground. Upon inspection, they realized it was his wife, Yao Shi. The father and daughter were shocked and cried for help. In an instant, neighbors gathered upon hearing the cries, all baffled. Bolu carefully inspected the scene and saw that the furnishings in the room were not in disarray. However, the gold earrings that the deceased wore on her ears and a gold pin on her hair were missing. A hemp rope as thick as a finger was tightly wrapped around her neck. It was then realized that she had been strangled to death. After going upstairs to check, they found an unlocked clothing chest containing 800 silver dollars, five pairs of gold bracelets, eight gold rings, and a string of pearls, all of which were missing. Only the remaining items were there and had not been moved. At the time, it was suspected that it was a robbery and looting. However, after inquiring with the neighbors, they all said that they had not heard any disturbance beforehand. At this point, it became even more confusing, so they immediately reported it to the First District Headquarters and asked for a thorough investigation. Upon hearing the report, the district chief, recognizing that it involved a human life and a large theft, considered the case serious and instructed Lu Yongde of the 16th Pu to report it to the Shanghai District Court for investigation. On the afternoon of the 5th, at around 2:00 PM, the assigned prosecutor and coroner arrived at the scene. It was determined that the deceased, Li Yao Shi, had been murdered and strangled with a rope. The corpse was prepared for burial and returned to the hospital after the examination. Afterwards, Li Bolu prepared a coffin and buried Yao Shi's body before transporting it back to his hometown for burial. According to Li's close neighbors, Li was honest and simple, so the family had some savings. His original wife had passed away early, and his second wife, Yao Shi, came from a brothel. It is not certain whether this is true. However, the daughter, Lan Zhen, is definitely not his biological child, nor was she born to his original wife. She is an adopted daughter, 16 years old this year, and quite beautiful. She received some elementary education and has now dropped out of school and is doing embroidery work at home. Although she is only 16, she is quite grown up and mature. She has a very romantic nature. She was previously acquainted with the younger brother of a cigarette and paper shop owner nearby, and recently fell in love with the young owner of a meat shop. The two are deeply in love. Before this incident, there was no noise in the house, so no one noticed. However, at around 4:00 PM, two people wearing uniforms, resembling military officers, were seen hurriedly leaving Li's house. After Li returned home from work alone, the case was discovered. According to Li's family, the hemp rope around the deceased's neck did not belong to the household. Therefore, the identity of the murderer is still unclear.</p>
<h3>Bandit Carjacking Case</h3>
<p>Purpose Still Unknown</p>
<p>At around 7:00 PM on the 6th of this month, three customers suddenly came to the China Motor Company near the North Railway Station: two men and one woman. The men were wearing long robes, resembling merchants, and were over 30 years old. The woman was wearing a cotton blouse and trousers made of striped cloth, with an old-fashioned round bun. She looked like a country woman and had a beautiful face. Their behavior suggested that they were travelers from another place. They said they needed to hire a car to go to the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track in the French Concession. The cashier ordered driver Zhang Dingshun to drive out with a No. 18236 (City No. 560) convertible car. Not long after the car reached the vicinity of the North Mud City Bridge, the three ordered the car to stop. One man jumped out of the car, while the other man and woman remained in the car. The car then drove straight to the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track, but the two did not get out of the car. They only ordered the driver to drive at full speed around the track once. Then they ordered the driver to drive to Longhua. The driver did as he was told. When the car reached near Longhua Road south of the Damuqiao Road, which is full of wilderness, with reeds growing everywhere, the two ordered the car to stop. Before the car could stop steadily, a person suddenly rushed out of the wilderness, brandishing a pistol, and forced the driver to get out of the car. Threatened by the gun, the driver had no choice but to get out of the car, obediently tied up, and abandoned in the reeds. The car was then driven away without a trace. After the car had gone far, the driver struggled for a long time and finally untied himself with his mouth. He hurried to report it to the Xinxi District Police Station of the Second District Headquarters. Upon receiving the report, Officer Wang immediately used the telephone to inform the Second District Headquarters and the English and French police to be on the lookout for the car. It was not until around 8:00 PM that night that the car was found in front of the Donglai Motor Company on Caishi Road in the French Concession. However, the purpose of the carjacking is still unknown.</p>

<h3>Verdict in Child Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Three Bandits Each Sentenced to Five Years and Deportation</p>
<p>To be Sent to Inland Courts for Further Trial</p>
<p>Wang Xianxiang, from Ningbo, residing at No. 98 Fengyu Lane, Saporse Road, Ximen Road in the French Concession, and serving as the Chinese Manager of Huifu Company, had his eleven-year-old son, Wang Jinshan, kidnapped on December 27th of last year by his wet nurse, Tang Zhushi, in collusion with kidnappers such as Zhang Yuheng.

Later, the case was solved by detectives and supervisors Jin Jiulin, Zheng Tanmu Li Yaolong, Deputy Tanmu Mao Jingen, Wang Rusong, Qian Yumin, and others from the French Concession. They rescued the kidnapped child and arrested the kidnappers Zhang Wangheng, Wang Youquan, Tang Zhushi, and suspects Qian Guangming, Tang Caigui, Wang Shiheng, Ji Ziyun, Wang Huangshi, and others. As reported previously, yesterday the police escorted the defendants to the French Court for trial. First, Detective Chief Xi reported the previous situation. The plaintiff, represented by a lawyer, requested a severe punishment according to the law. When questioned, Zhang Yuheng confessed to colluding in the kidnapping of the plaintiff's son, but said that Tang Zhushi carried him onto the car. Tang Zhushi claimed that the young master was in her arms and was snatched away by bandits, and that she did not collude in the kidnapping. After the interrogator repeatedly questioned her, she admitted that she had been promised 300 yuan, equivalent to three years of wages, after the incident. Wang Youquan confessed to writing three ransom letters, demanding 20,000 yuan. The other suspects, Qian Guangming and others, all confessed that although they knew Zhang and others, they did not dare to collude in the kidnapping.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Vaccination Report</h3>
<p>Since last October, the Municipal Health Bureau has been providing free vaccinations to citizens. However, many people neglect it, cling to old habits, and delay vaccination. Some think they have already been vaccinated, and those who are older do not pay attention. Some think that vaccination is not possible in winter and must wait for spring, or that children are too young to be vaccinated, delaying it again and again, resulting in many people contracting smallpox. They do not know that vaccination can be done at any time, and is not limited to children. Adults can also be vaccinated at any time. Therefore, during a smallpox epidemic, even infants must be vaccinated. It has been discovered that some residents in the city have contracted smallpox. Citizens are urged to get vaccinated as soon as possible to prevent smallpox.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Meets with the Education Community</h3>
<p>And Schedules a Meeting with Staff of the Ministry of Education to Discuss Various Issues</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang has recently paid extraordinary attention to education. In order to understand the educational system and various issues, he personally instructed Chen Bu Lei, the Vice Minister of Education, to introduce several people in the ministry who have studied education and to give simple lectures separately. Chen has already arranged for Zhao Nai Chuan, the Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Sun Ben Wen, the Director of Higher Education, Gu Shu Sen, the Director of General Education, and Li Zheng, the Director of Social Education, to be responsible for giving lectures and waiting for Chairman Chiang to schedule a meeting. It is also heard that Chairman Chiang has consulted with many people in the country who have rich experience in running education, in order to listen to their reports on educational work. Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, came to Nanjing a few days ago and was personally asked about the school's situation and given great encouragement. On the 8th, Huang Yanpei of the China Vocational Education Society was received, and he inquired in detail about the crux of why education in China has not progressed in the past.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Appoints Li Zheng as Director of the Department of Social Education</h3>
<p>Yang Lian, the former Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, has left office, and the Ministry of Education has appointed Li Zheng as the director. Li studied rural education in the United States and served as the Chief of the Department of Social Education of the Hebei Education Department and the Acting President of Beiping Normal University.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Inspects Local Education Results</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department Holds a Discussion Meeting | Supervisors Report | Resolves on Rectification Measures</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department held a discussion meeting in the conference room on December 27th. The attendees included Xiang Ju Tan, Cao Shu Tian, Li Jia Han, Huang Shao Hong, Yang Nai Kang, Han Shou Jin, Yao He Chu, Hou Bing Pu, Yu Qing Tang, Qian Yong He, Yi Zuo Lin, and Xiang Shao Xuan, Chen He Xian. The discussion focused on the following:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Various Issues Related to Inspecting Local Education ㈠ Supervisor Yi Zuolin reported on the status of education and his opinions, roughly divided into the following points: 1. Many local educational administrators are irresponsible. For example, the inspection reports of the education committee members of various counties are mostly perfunctory, and even regarding the implementation of laws and regulations, they are treated as mere formalities. The importance of the Education Department's Order No. 855 regarding local education is so great, yet only Taixian County has been able to implement it effectively. It seems that a performance evaluation rule should be established regarding the performance of county supervisors and education committee members to facilitate compliance and assessment. 2. Students in the normal school departments of secondary schools see themselves as equal to ordinary middle school students and are completely unaware of the responsibilities of normal school students. If this continues, the spirit of normal school education will be lost completely. Measures should be drafted to pay special attention to the practice of normal school students. If the prescribed period is insufficient, they should not be allowed to graduate. Furthermore, county normal schools often lack both talent and financial resources and are only nominally normal schools. It seems more appropriate to pool the talents and financial resources of several counties to jointly run a school. 3. When county middle schools were first established, there were limitations on funding. Now, various counties are gradually expanding, especially Yancheng and other counties. Some restrictions should be added. On the one hand, more funds can be used for free education, and on the other hand, the disadvantages of being named without substance and not meeting needs can be reduced. 4. There are many unqualified elementary school teachers. They are not prepared at all when teaching, so naturally they do not fulfill their duties. Furthermore, the teaching materials are completely monopolized by a few large bookstores, and methods should be found to improve this situation. 5. Social education is even more difficult to examine than schools. Therefore, those who fulfill their duties truly benefit the people. If they do not fulfill their duties, they spend the whole year perfunctorily, doing nothing, and it is not easy to detect. Strict assessment is also necessary. Furthermore, the publications used by social education institutions are all the same. Printing them separately is a waste of financial resources. It seems that funds can be centralized and edited separately for general use.</p>
<p>㈡ Supervisor Cao Shutian reported on the inspection situation, roughly divided into the following points: 1. Rural elementary schools must have agricultural leave during busy farming seasons, and during the regular time, it may be precisely during leisure time. Students sacrifice their studies quite a bit. It is not known whether there are any flexible measures regarding holidays. 2. Many elementary school teachers in various counties are not familiar with the complex teaching method. In the future, if training courses are held, more attention should be paid to this. 3. The treatment of teachers in various counties, both in urban and rural areas, has not been consistent, so elementary school teachers in rural areas, even those who have graduated from rural normal schools, are unwilling to work there. This should be remedied in the future. 4. The education administration of Jiading County is the best, because its central elementary school district system is linked, and the efficiency is very high, which can be used as a reference for various counties. 5. The number of students in rural elementary schools, except for Wu County and Songjiang, is actually very small. In the future, classes should be merged and enrollments should be increased. 6. The social education achievements of the counties visited by the reporter, such as the Songjiang Public Education Center, have a kind of magic power to summon the masses. This is because the staff in the center have a kind of skill that can attract the masses. The results of its organized round-the-world lecture tour are also very good wherever it goes. In short, the masses cannot be educated without arousing their interest in art and entertainment. 7. The biggest problem in public education is that students cannot be retained for school, and the number of students gradually decreases. It is even more difficult to set up farmers' education centers in rural areas to impart knowledge and skills. Therefore, it is more difficult to do. It is best to ask social education experts to guide them regularly.</p>
<p>㈢ Supervisor Xiang Jutan reported on the inspection situation, roughly as follows: 1. The normal school departments of secondary schools and county normal schools and rural normal schools in various counties should be ordered to pay attention to practice. 2. There are many local factional disputes in various counties. In the future, attention should be paid to accusing cases, punishing those who are true, and also investigating those who falsely accuse. 3. Many of the county education finances were before the 18th year, and the deficits and entanglements should be presented separately and ordered to be cleared up. 4. For public education, Bao Ying is the best in Jiangbei and Huai'an is the worst. One is universal distribution of wealth, and the other is uneven distribution. The results are the best in Xinghua and the worst in Lianxia. In Jiangnan, Wuxi is the best, followed by Wujin.</p>
<p>Secretary Hou Hongjian added the following comments to the reports of the three supervisors: 1. The assessment standards for administrators should be proposed immediately so that they can be implemented in the next inspection. 2. Changing holidays seems to be feasible. 3. Teachers' salaries are divided into five grades, and it may be difficult to equalize them at once. 4. County schools should have the following restrictions: 1. The funding should be more than a certain number of tens of thousands. 2. There is a need for students to go to school if there are about ten people. Only then will they be allowed to establish it. 5. Social education should hire social education experts to be responsible for inspection.</p>
<p>(B) Discussion Results</p>
<p>After listening to the reports of the members, the director proposed the following conclusions: 1. We should seek closer liaison between the hall and the locality, so as to make various statistics according to the inspection and make it the only way. 2. Establishing performance appraisal rules to prevent idleness of administrative personnel. 3. Regarding the various situations of the above-mentioned local education advantages and disadvantages, rules should be formulated for compliance, which should be filed and implemented separately by the responsible department, and orders and warnings should be handled quickly by the responsible department.</p>

<h3>The New Year of the Science Society of China</h3>
<p>(1) The Mingfu Library opened at 3:00 p.m. on New Year's Day. More than two hundred members and Chinese and Western guests attended. They first took photos in front of the library, and then entered the auditorium in an orderly manner. Cai Yuanpei presided over the ceremony. The chairman said in his speech that the society was initiated fifteen years ago. Now, there is a biology research institute in Nanjing, doing experimental work and displaying specimens. They have always wanted to build a library that meets scientific standards, and it has only been realized today. Today, the Mingfu Library is completed. It is a pity that Mr. Sun Zhe Sheng could not come and has not yet seen it, because this library has received a lot of help from Mr. Sun. This library commemorates Mr. Hu Mingfu, because he was an important initiator of the society and sacrificed greatly for the society. Therefore, the first great building of the society is to commemorate Mr. Mingfu. Today is also the opening of the version exhibition, because the society's collection of books is limited, so we discussed with the libraries and collectors in Beijing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shanghai to send their rare books for display. We hope that the Mingfu Library will be able to establish a book version museum in the future, like Germany and France have this kind of museum. Today, we are very honored to have the consuls general of Belgium and Germany present. Chinese people like Mr. Ma Xiangbo, who is already ninety-two years old, came in spite of the cold weather, and Mr. Wu Zhihui rushed from Nanjing. Then the Belgian Consul General spoke on behalf of the Shanghai Consular Corps, and then Ma Xiangbo spoke, saying that this small library is the expression of national construction, with many words of encouragement and sadness. Then Wu Zhihui spoke, saying that engraving books was a Chinese invention and spread to foreign countries, making a great contribution to the world. Western countries have science, so everything is progressing quickly. Taking this library as an example, there are many scientific books, but the science contributed by China itself may not fill a shelf. In the future, if its own scientific books are fully arranged, that will be the greatest contribution. After that, they dispersed after visiting and having refreshments.</p>
<p>(2) The Social Friends' Party was held at the New World Restaurant on New Year's Day at 7:00 p.m. The Shanghai friends and their families attended, with more than one hundred people. After the dinner, Cao Liangxia, the chairman, first introduced Chu Minyi to give a speech reviewing the three international movements of the past year, divided into economics, politics, and sports. Our country has representatives participating in all three, showing considerable achievements, but there are still many places where we need to work hard. We should use the Three Principles of the People to develop the three movements. Then the Wang Ruixian Music Hall Children's Music Team played music. All twelve members played various instruments such as bells, drums, and rattles in unison. There were also seven-year-old girls Chen Xiuya and Dong Guanggu who played piano solos one after another, with sonorous tones, which were absolutely amazing to the audience. Then Wang Yunwu gave a speech on the omnipotence of science, advocating that instead of saying "Congratulations on getting rich" when meeting in the new year, we should say "Congratulations on the development of science." Then eleven-year-old girl Wu Leyi played a piano solo, with skillful wrist movements and sophisticated playing. The listeners sighed that she was a genius, which was also due to Ms. Wang Ruixian's training of children. Then Cai Yuanpei spoke about the three major new initiatives of the National Government this year, which were the National Assembly, the amnesty of political prisoners, and the abolition of Likin, and proposed the problem of the high value of gold and the low value of silver, and asked all members to study it. Finally, Chu Minyi performed three sets of magic tricks, which were amazing and everyone praised them. After the meeting, they took photos and dispersed.</p>
<p>(3) The book version exhibition was displayed on the third floor of the library, divided into two major parts, modern and ancient, which were full of beautiful things. It opened on New Year's Day and lasted for six days. The average number of visitors per day was more than five hundred, especially on the sixth day. The society has stationed armed patrolmen and plainclothes detectives to guard day and night, and there was no negligence during the political meeting period.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Education Will Review Operas</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government promulgated the "Regulations on the Management of Public Entertainment Venues in This City," the Municipal Bureau of Education immediately formulated the "Rules for Reviewing Operas" in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the regulations. Because operas and other dramas have the effect of changing customs and occupying an important position in popular education, and entertainment venues in this city are developing day by day, if strict scrutiny is not given, it is feared that there will be many malpractices. It is learned that the rules have been submitted to the Municipal Government for promulgation and implementation, and a thorough investigation of all entertainment venues in the city will be carried out, classified statistics will be compiled, and implementation will be scheduled. It is expected that all venues will be ordered to comply soon.</p>
<h3>The Fifth</h3>
<p>Standing Committee Meeting of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture</p>
<p>The China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture convened its fifth standing committee meeting at the Cangzhou Hotel in this city the day before yesterday (the 9th), gathering all the directors to discuss the affairs of the association over the past year and determine the future direction of the association. The meeting was adjourned in the afternoon. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Chinese directors who attended included Cai Yuanpei, Jiang Menglin, Hu Shi, Zhao Yuanren, and Ren Hongjun. The American directors included Stuart Leiden, Gu Lin, Baker, and Monroe. The meeting was chaired by Cai Yuanpei.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation Two meetings were held the day before yesterday, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. In the morning, the staff of the various institutions of the association, such as the National Library of Peiping, the Institute of Living Surveys, the Institute of Social Research, and the Institute of Social Surveys, reported on the work situation. The secretariat of the association also reported on the business and economic situation of the association over the past year. In the afternoon, the future direction of the association was discussed.</p>
<p>Custody of Funds The funds in the custody of the association are of two types. One type is directly kept by the association and is the second installment of the American return of the Boxer Indemnity. From 1924 to 1945, 540,000 British pounds were allocated to the association each year. The association stores one-third of it and subsidizes cultural undertakings with two-thirds. In addition, there is the Tsinghua University Foundation in Beiping, entrusted by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is the first installment of the Boxer Indemnity of 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Determining the Direction At the meeting the day before yesterday afternoon, it was decided that the funds in custody, storage, and investment would be signed and recognized by the directors. If the interest rate on deposits in banks is too low, the income from investment would be higher. Therefore, large amounts of funds were previously used to purchase foreign bonds. Recently, the price of gold has soared, and investment in the world bond market has been more panicked. It was decided to end the profits obtained after the previous purchase of foreign bonds increased in price. From now on, the investment in gold will be changed to investment in silver, and various domestic government bonds will be purchased. In the past, China was in internal turmoil, and the bond market was unstable. Recently, the internal turmoil has been put down, the country has been unified, and the government has issued stable bonds with good interest rates. For silver investment, there is nothing better than this. All of these opinions were unanimously approved.</p>
<p>Directors Leave Shanghai The association originally scheduled January of each year as the standing committee period and June as the annual meeting period. The method of fund allocation will be discussed again during the annual meeting in June. The location of the meeting has not yet been determined. Dr. Monroe is scheduled to take a train to Beijing and then to Peiping today (the 11th). Mr. Jiang Menglin will go to Hangzhou tonight, and Mr. Zhao Yuanren is also scheduled to return to Peiping tonight. Mr. Hu Shi will stay in Shanghai for a few days.</p>

<p>The Shenyang Northeast University basketball team, tall and strong, is skilled in using the five-man united defense. Their advance and retreat are unified. Under the coaching of the famous instructor Mr. Song Fufu, their performance has become increasingly miraculous. They have already firmly held the leading position in the basketball circles of the three northeastern provinces. Last month, the team participated in the Shenyang All-City Group A Basketball Championship, successively defeating strong opponents such as Fengyong University, Agricultural and Forestry University, and Shenshui Team, and won the championship. Now, taking advantage of the winter vacation, the team is led southward to enhance their skills and learn from each other. They are scheduled to depart from Shenyang by train tonight (the 11th) and arrive in Shanghai around the evening of the 14th or the early morning of the 15th. After a day of rest, they will begin the competition on the evening of the 17th and leave Shanghai for Beijing on the 27th, planning to compete with Central University and Jinling University. The team hopes to compete with Qingguang, Huadong, Chizhi, Tongji, Hujiang, St. John's, Zhonggong, McLean, West Qing, and other teams in Shanghai. However, due to time constraints, only six matches have been confirmed. Therefore, the opposing teams are requested to contact Mr. Hao Boyang of the YMCA for arrangements. The competition venue is at the Chinese Basketball Hall. The team consists of ten people, led by Mr. Song Fufu. The full team roster is as follows:</p>
<p>(Captain) Ma Bingjun, (Players) Zhao Lingzhi, Yuan Tingrui, Yang Zhongxiu, Pang Ying, Shi Wanshan, Tian Xinyuan, Jiang Zuozhou, Fu Baochun, Huang Shouli.</p>
<h3>This Year's Davis Cup</h3>

<p>Harada, Sato Hirotaro, Sato Shichiro Japanese tennis circles have selected the country's three heroes of 1930, Harada, Sato Hirotaro, and Sato Shichiro, as Japan's players for the 1931 World Davis Cup. Harada and Sato Hirotaro were both representatives in the previous tournament and are well-known. The newly participating Sato Shichiro is a first-class figure among Japan's rising stars. Last year, he jumped from fifth to third place, attracting attention from the entire national tennis community, and was unanimously supported. Thus, he was elected as one of this year's Davis Cup players.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Team's Expedition to the Philippines</h3>
<p>Football and Basketball Teams Depart on the 7th</p>

<h3>This Year's National Games to be Held on Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>| Ten-Day Event | Budget of 1.2 Million Yuan |</p>
<p>| Xia Guangyu, Chief Secretary | Zhang Xinfu, Chen Xiaotian, Deputy Secretaries |</p>
<p>This year's National Games has long been decided to be held in Nanjing. The venue is in Linggu Temple, and a portion has already begun construction. Now, Zhang Xinfu is appointed as Deputy Secretary, and Hu Zhizhong is invited as Secretary to assist Chief Secretary Xia Guangyu in planning everything. Recently, Shen Siliang, Ma John, Hao Gengsheng, Rong Qizhao, Dong Shouyi, Gao Xiwei, and six others were appointed as consultants. A meeting was held at the Mausoleum Office (i.e., the Preparatory Office of the National Games) on the 6th and 7th of this month. In addition to the six consultants, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Boling, Lin Sen, Wu Bangwei, Xu Zhendong, Du Tingxiu, Xia Guangyu, Zhang Xinfu, Hu Zhizhong, Kai Xiangsheng, Chen Xiaotian, and others were present. All matters concerning the organization of the National Games, competition regulations, sports rules, venue construction, and amateur sports association rules were resolved at this meeting. Even the various referees to be invited to the meeting in the future have been determined. In terms of funding, the budget is 1.2 million yuan, of which 830,000 yuan is for construction, which has been approved and allocated by the National Government. The event is scheduled to be held on October 10th, lasting for ten days. Finally, Wang Zhengting and Zhang Boling proposed that when national sports leaders gather in Nanjing for the National Games in the future, a conference should be convened to discuss the reorganization of the National Sports Association, with the intention that the association should be jointly run by the people and the National Government.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Preparatory Committee of the National Games had previously appointed Xia Guangyu as the Chief Secretary and Zhang Xinfu and Chen Xiaotian as Deputy Chief Secretaries. However, Zhang Xinfu is the Chief Secretary of the Sports Department of the Nanjing Lizi Society, and in reality, it is difficult to take care of both. It is learned that the authorities of the conference, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the conference affairs, have specially requested Chairman Jiang to temporarily transfer Mr. Zhang to serve as a commissioner. It is heard that Chairman Jiang has now approved it. Mr. Zhang will officially work at the National Games Preparatory Office of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing starting from January 1st to assist Director Xia in planning everything.</p>

<p>Editor's Note</p>
<p>After a short break, I am here to meet with you, dear readers, again. To others, our life of scissors, paste, and red pen seems very comfortable. But editing a publication involves all sorts of troubles and pains. On the one hand, we have to please the readers, and on the other hand, we have to please the contributors. It is like a weak daughter-in-law trying to please her parents-in-law, with a bitter-sweet experience. This kind of feeling can only be understood by editing one or two publications. Today is the beginning of the year 20 of the Republic of China, and as I meet with readers again, I must first say a few honest words to the contributors. Our attitude has always been open. As long as it is a good work that suits the readers' tastes, we sincerely welcome it. However, there are a few important points that everyone should pay attention to: (1) The number of words must not exceed 600 words. If it exceeds this number, we will inevitably have to cut it. (2) Each manuscript must be stamped with the national emblem so that the accounting department can verify it when paying the fee. Those who refuse payment are not subject to this rule. (3) Manuscripts should be novel and meaningful, and should not talk about superstition or nonsense. (4) Recently, there have been too many gatherings and weddings and funerals, and it is really impossible to remember them all. Unless they are extremely important, please do not describe or send them, as it would be a waste of ink. (5) Please do not send short stories or poems of a social nature. Travelogues from abroad are also not accepted because we already have several specially commissioned manuscripts.</p>
<p>Please abide by the above points at all times. Do not regard them as empty words and forget them after a while.</p>
<h3>Xinwei New Dictionary of Phrases</h3>
<p>Meihua Hall Master</p>
<p>This year's sexagenary cycle is Xinwei. Wei belongs to the sheep. Therefore, I have researched the classics about sheep. "Sheep plate" is a Shanghai dialect, meaning using money improperly. Nowadays, it has been changed to "big vegetable basin".</p>
<p>"Sheep gas" is a term in the Peking opera world, meaning that the skill is not enough and the actor lacks the elements of drama. Now, Shanghai people have broadened its meaning. Anyone who does things unprofessionally is called "full of sheep gas".</p>
<p>"Sheep wool" is also a term in the Peking opera world. Its meaning is similar to "half gas", but it mostly contains the meaning of "not good". Performers often say "sheep wool" when referring to someone whose art is not refined. It is most similar to the meaning of "leek" in the industry.</p>
<p>"Two Sheep" and "Two Sheep" are Peking opera lyrics from "South Heaven Gate" sung by Cao Fu, which has the line "Two sheep escaped from the tiger's mouth." Qilin Tong changed it to "South Two Sheep".</p>
<p>"Sheep Belly Soup" is Peking opera, also known as "June Snow", also known as "The Injustice to Dou E", also known as "The Golden Lock".</p>
<p>"Dragon Girl Herding Sheep" is a unique drama of the famous actor Huang Yulin. The script was written by the writer Lu Danjun. It contains a long section of "anti-second huang", which is very brilliant.</p>
<p>"Su Wu Herding Sheep" Su Wu was a Han Dynasty man. During the reign of Emperor Wu, he was sent to the Xiongnu and herded sheep with integrity for 19 years. Now Ma Lianliang has adapted it into a drama and performed it in Beijing, which was very popular among opera lovers. "Three Sheep Heads" are Peking opera lines from "Fishing and Killing Home" by Xiao En.</p>
<p>"Dog Bites Sheep" is a Yue proverb. It is commonly said that dogs and sheep do not get along. They bark wildly when they meet. Therefore, Yue people use "dog bites sheep" to describe those who quarrel all the time. Also, in Yue customs, men and women who are born in the years of the dog or sheep are not matched in marriage.</p>
<p>The horns of the antelope are hard and harder than diamonds. There was a three-day publication on the sea called "Diamond". The original title was "Antelope Horn", which meant to be harder than everything.</p>
<p>"Fierce Tiger Drives Sheep" is a play lyric. Lu Boshe in "Catching and Releasing Cao" has the line "Dreaming of a fierce tiger driving a flock of sheep".</p>
<h3>New Year's in the Capital</h3>
<p>— Chen Shuping, from the Capital</p>
<p>Since the National Government promulgated the National Calendar, the Capital Municipal Government has been vigorously implementing it. In advance, it specifically issued notices to all sectors, requiring that all receipts and payments must comply with the National Calendar. Anyone who dares to continue using the Lunar Calendar will be considered illegal. On New Year's Eve, the police stations in each district distributed Spring Festival couplets to each household. The words were novel and in line with the spirit of the party and the country, such as "Living in a bright world during the day," "People are in the gentle spring breeze," "Invigorate the spirit and jointly plan for happiness," "Unite forces and participate in the renovation," "The revolution is successful and the people are happy," "The doctrine is realized and the world is in spring," "The blue sky reflects the world," "The white sun shines on the new spring," "Vigorous new national spirit," "Peaceful old national style," etc. At the same time, in order to promote public entertainment, it was ordered that all game venues should reduce sales by half for three days from New Year's Day and encourage and subsidize the necessary decorations for the New Year. Although the weather was gloomy and rainy on New Year's Day, the streets were filled with red men and green women, coming and going like a shuttle. All the shops were closed for business. All the agencies hung flags and lanterns to celebrate the New Year. At night, a lantern parade was held. In addition to various bird, animal, figure, and flower lanterns, several dragon lanterns were added. They moved and danced. The spectators were crowded. The people along the way set off firecrackers to express their welcome. The prosperity of singing and dancing was a scene of peace and prosperity in the New Year. Its grand occasion was rare in decades. As for public entertainment venues, they were all full in the past few days. According to the capital, since the ban on gambling and prostitution, public entertainment has been most developed by movies. The World on Zhongshan Road is the only sound film theater in the capital. Starting from the first day of the year, it premiered "Flaming Youth," starring Clara Bow, and on the sixth day, it added "Na Yun Di's Magic Dance" by Austrian, so the business was the best in the theaters. Others, such as the "National Film Grand King" showing "Taohua Lake", and "Mingxing" showing "Wildflowers and Weeds", were also quite crowded with viewers. The game venues include the "Great World" run by Gu Wuwu and the "Minyin Company" newly established last year, which are fiercely competitive. The Minyin Company specially hired Bai Yukun, Ma Xiuying, and other actors to come to Ning and rehearse their signature masterpieces. Secondly, the singers in the tea houses sing in a clear voice, and there is no space left in the seats. In short, this was the first New Year after the implementation of the National Calendar, so all sectors felt extremely excited and joyful. I have extracted the grand occasion as above, to record the fleeting impressions.</p>
<h3>A Review of New Fashion in the Past Five Years</h3>
<p>— Li Yuyi</p>
<p>Five years ago, at the fashion show of the Lianyu Society, three ladies, Yu Danhan, Sun Jingyi, and Tan Lingjun, were the leaders. The trend was initially transmitted, and it was praised as being divine. At that time, the so-called new fashion, in addition to shawls, mostly exhausted the style of vests. The service of the New Fashion Company was also no more than this. The painters Jiang Xiaojian, Zhang Chenbo, and others all devoted themselves to it, sparing no effort to please women. The Yunshang Company was thus highlighted. The ladies' shawls were mostly bell-shaped. During the performance, they hugged them in their hands, making their waists tighter, resembling Indian women walking with their towels wrapped around their waists. It could also slightly show the beauty of their figures. However, when they stood with their arms hanging down, they looked like large fly models from the Ministry of Health, which was not very elegant. Only Ms. Tang Ying wore a short skirt to the knees and narrow sleeves, unlike the others, and was called the latest fashion. To sum up, the new fashion at that time had one characteristic: short sleeves and long clothes, still retaining the style of long skirts dragging on the ground.</p>
<p>Since then, the trend has been towards short clothes and thin waists. When viewed from the side, those who wear them reveal their slender figures, making them appear even more frail. Occasionally, there are long ones, with long sleeves and long clothes different from the short sleeves and short clothes, but they all break the previous system of upper garments and skirts and purely wear shirts.</p>
<p>The change in this shirt (namely, the commonly known cheongsam) can also be traced. The first person to resolutely break the three-hundred-year-old skirt system was Ms. Li Minghui, who is now rarely seen. She created the cheongsam vest to replace the skirt. The cheongsam vest was once the fashion for young girls. However, the meaning of the vest may be a relic of the armor. Later, maids wore it for easy operation. We can still imagine the style of aunts and older sisters wearing moon-white vests. Usually, decent women are ashamed to wear short vests. Unexpectedly, at that time, they were extended from short to long, which increased their charm. As for this year, they have been shortened from long to short, and their front lapels have been loosened and opened like men's suits, which is even more sufficient to show a diligent, down-to-earth, and unrestrained attitude towards work.</p>
<p>From this, two opposite trends can be observed: the style of the shirt was initially long, then fashionable when short, and now it is returning to long. The style of the vest was initially fashionable when short.</p>
<h3>Home Sweet Home</h3>
<p>Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>(1) Although we play in the prosperous Palace of Pleasure, no matter how well we are treated, it is still not as good as my home. There is a kind of true beauty there, which is bestowed upon us by Heaven. I have searched all over the world, and there is no place like my home. Home, sweet sweet sweet home. There is no place like my home. No place like my home.</p>
<p>(2) I, walking in the wilderness and looking at the moonlight, feel that my mother is thinking of us over there. She is leaning against the door, looking through a bush of winter holly. It is a pity that I cannot smell the fragrance of the flowers. Home, sweet sweet sweet home. I have searched all over the world, and there is no place like my home.</p>
<p>(3) Since I left home, all the glory is false. Let me go back to live in that low grass hut. The birds are singing, promising my request. My heart is soothed, more precious than anything else. Home, sweet sweet sweet home. It is a pity that I am at the end of the world. There is no place like my home.</p>
<p>Thin Juan notes: This song was originally named "Home, Sweet Home", written by J. H. Payne, the former US Consul to North Africa. Mr. Payne was born without a home and deeply felt the pain of loneliness. He wrote this song to express his melancholy. To this day, it has spread all over the world and is sung by almost every household. I recently compiled the "New Family" magazine for the Datong Bookstore and specially asked the senior Tian Xu Wo Sheng to translate it into Chinese. I asked Ms. Cai Zhihe to create a simple score and include the original song in five-line staff notation at the beginning of the volume. This magazine will be published on January 15th. I sincerely hope that everyone in the country will read this song so that they will know the preciousness of family and pay more attention to the way of ethics.</p>
<p>Progressed and lengthened. Recently, it has returned to short. What can be observed more is that which has not been repeated, that is, the clothes are becoming thinner and the waist is becoming thinner, which is in line with the trend of women's dress in the world. This is worthy of study.</p>
<h3>A Record of French Destruction of Annam's Silver Coins</h3>
<p>Jie Lu</p>
<p>European countries, great destroyers of countries, all first use economic aggression. For example, India was destroyed by the British East India Company, Annam was destroyed by the Red River navigation rights, and Egypt was destroyed by foreign debt. Once the economy collapses, the country will follow suit. It is like a person relying on essence and blood to live. Depleting the essence and sucking the blood day by day, even if one is as strong as Ben Yu or as huge as Wu Ba, there is no one who will not die. Since the European War, all the weak and small people in the world have been蠢然欲動. As in the recent creation of the non-resistance doctrine by Gandhi in India, its momentum is especially inviolable. The French are worried about this, so they want to control the fate of the Vietnamese people, making them unable to recover after ten thousand kalpas. This is why the French destroyed Annam's silver coins. A certain bank on the Bund, which is jointly operated by the Chinese and French, collected 50 million yuan of Annam's silver coins from the French government last autumn and entrusted the bank to transport them to Shanghai for destruction. First, they destroyed them with machines, fearing that Chinese and Annam's wealthy merchants would rush to buy them at high prices. The matter was heard by the silver furnace industry on the sea, and they all scrambled to solicit business. Finally, it stopped because the price did not match. The bank then set up its own silver furnace to melt them. This spring, it began to assign the matter to each furnace. Melting and casting ingots to meet the needs. However, the profits of each furnace are extremely thin, about three or four tenths of a cent. This matter has not been published in the major and minor newspapers on the sea to this day. I think the French are cunning in their intentions, wanting to make banknotes spread all over Vietnam, with no cash at all. Even if they want to do something, it will be in vain. The matter is no different from Qin Shihuang's destruction of weapons. Then, how can we bear to say that our country today is full of foreign goods and banknotes are rampant?</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence</h3>
<p>(Ninety-three)</p>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>A Diary of Pilgrimage in Italy</p>
<p>(1) Rome, October 16th</p>
<p>June 4th | Great Cathedral of Saint Peter | Vatican Papal Palace | Sistine Chapel |</p>
<p>On the second floor of the central building, there is a room housing the most famous cloud-patterned sarcophagus. Its entirety is exceptionally prominent, carving out the tense muscles and anguished expressions with vivid realism. It is said to be the sarcophagus of Emperor Marcus Aurelius of the second century, or the sarcophagus of Emperor Constantine the Great's mother. I do not have time to investigate in detail now. To the left is another large sarcophagus, a fourth-century relic, the coffin of Constantine the Great's beloved daughter, Constantia. Its overall form can be said to have been influenced by Greek sarcophagi. Entering another room is the Stone Statue Chamber, displaying many Roman-era stone statues. These statues are said to have been excavated in Tivoli. Comparing these Roman-era stone statues with Greek portrait sculptures immediately reveals various differences. Although Roman-era portrait sculptures lack the rich and splendid beauty of late Greek works, as portrait sculptures, they can be said to have exhausted the abilities of meticulous precision. Their realistic depiction and keen expression of impressions hold significant meaning in the history of sculpture. Roman nobles had a habit of worshipping ancestors and liked to place busts of ancestors in their homes. This custom was the reason for the development of portrait sculpture. There are also many stone pillars, moved from Hadrian's Villa.</p>
<p>Entering another room, a marble statue stands in the center. This is the statue of Octavian Augustus, the first emperor of the Roman Empire. His breastplate is adorned with intricate reliefs, and his right finger points, and his eyes gaze towards the place of conquest, revealing a stern and heroic bearing. His awe-inspiring majesty makes it almost difficult to look at him for long. This is undoubtedly a great masterpiece of the time, and a treasure for art historians of later generations to critique and appreciate. At the same time, it is a symbol of the Roman Empire's dominance in all directions. I wandered under this marble statue, admiring the emperor's carved features, and couldn't help but feel a surge of ancient emotion.</p>
<p>This emperor was Caesar's nephew, continuing Caesar's ambition. In fifteen years, he eliminated the internal strife and unified the Roman Empire, laying the foundation for two hundred years of Roman peace. He also conquered Egypt, expanding Rome's territory in the world, westward to the Atlantic Ocean, south to the Sahara Desert, and north to the banks of the Danube and Rhine rivers, establishing a great empire unprecedented since Alexander the Great. He held power for over forty years, transformed the city of Rome, and built unprecedented palaces, giving architecture a major revolution. His great undertaking reflects the immortal achievements of the Roman Empire in history. The so-called cultural life of Europe, from which its tradition originates, achieved rapid progress in the emperor's era. Facing this statue, I couldn't help but say:</p>
<p>"Great hero, Octavian!"</p>
<p>Indeed, the Rome of Octavian's era was like the Greece of Pericles' era, a golden age that shone brightly in history. I ask, has Europe ever had a second emperor as great as him since then? "I see no ancients before me, and no successors after me." At this moment, I unknowingly fell into a vast sense of emotion.</p>
