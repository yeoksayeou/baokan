<h3>爲留學生進一言</h3>
<p>我國自淸季戊午維新。派員留學外國以後。分赴歐美以及日本者。逐年激增。迄於目前。爲數應至爲鉅大頃國内多數留美學生。又將出發。記者略有所感。謹以至誠爲進一言。我國本爲農業國家但自近世受歐美工業革命新潮之鼓盪亦漸次步入工業國家之途在新舊蛻變之際。其過渡橋樑。厥爲具有近世工業及自然科學學問之專門人材此種專門人材。卽爲建設新社會新國家之骨幹。雖其他亦有新政治經濟法訓等專門人材之需要。但要皆退居次位。故就目前我國情形言。留洋學生應偏重於以求上述之工業與自然科學學識爲目的。然後所學乃能致用。乃正切於國家之需要。此記者所企望於今日留洋學生者一。正惟我國家處於新舊交替之蛻變程途中。故有待於吾人努力之問題極夥。化學也各種重工業也電力也。種種科學上之學問。皆我國家急需人食糧。而此食糧之求得。又急待於留學生之努力。故今日留學生於出國之先。應就我國家目前急待解决之問題中選擇一問題。携以航海俱往。留學期間。卽以求得解决此問題之學識爲自身之責任。夫然後學有鵠的。學爲有爲。此記者所企望於今日留學生者二。研求學問。應腦與手同時並用。求學理上之知。固爲重要。求實騐上之行。亦决不可少。書本中之學理爲死的。實際上之行動爲活的。以死的學理用於活的行動。乃愈顯學理之眞實。以活的行動證印死的學理。乃愈見行動之效能。偏用手旣失之於知。偏用腦亦失之於行。必也以其所學證之於行。能知能行。然後乃無愧乎專門人材。歸國乃能適用。若讀萬卷書。記萬條定理。一到臨事。卽茫無所措。則是死的藏書架。而</p>
<p>非活的實用機器也。藏書之架。實非我國家今日所急需。故今日留洋學生之研究學問。應腦與手。並用。從書本中學理。從實行中求得經騐。一面入學校學。一面入工廠做。必以如此之精神。如此之努力。乃能求得眞實有用之學問。此記者所企望於今日留學生者三也。實用科學。品類紛繁。欲學有專長。勢難全通盡曉。如醫學之中。有内科有外科有耳科目科齒科骨科等各科。吾人决難能以一人而兼習各科。開設醫院時。更難能以一人兼治各科。假使集合同志。分習各科。及其實用。亦分任各科。則事易舉而功用易見。醫學如此。他學亦然。故今日留學生出國之先。應選擇目的相同之同志數人。以一種事業爲鵠的。分習其應用之各種專門學識。譬如造紙。若習化。學。若學機器。學管理工廠。若學選擇原料。學成歸國。卽各出所學。合組工廠。其能成功。殆無疑義。此記者所企望於今日留學生者四也。抑尤有進者。遠涉重洋。耗費至鉅。是乃爲求實學。决非爲求虛名。若留而不學。學而不實。吃完數年洋麵包。博得一學士博士之頭銜。卽歸以炫示國人。誇耀親友。或更持以爲營求之工具。是爲我國家之蠧。亦卽現社會之蠧也。他如文學一科。最不切實用。以其輕易也。學者特衆。此種洋八股。實貽誤無窮。亦爲今日留學生諸君所　應予注意者。最後。記者謹以至誠禱祝異日隨留學生諸君一同歸國者。不爲博士學士之虛榮。而爲富我國家利我民生之實學。留學生諸君勉乎哉。</p>

<h3>韓民移殖東北之研究</h3>
<p>（三續）彬</p>
<p>自光緒二十一年淸日戰後。訂立馬關條約。在名義上日迫我承認韓國爲獨立國。而實際上則取而自居之。自是而後。韓人以受日人壓迫。移來日衆。日人則更居中挑撥中韓國民間之惡感。以期侵奪延邊四縣。光緒三十三年「間島」之爭。實暴露日本對東北侵略最初之野心。</p>
<p>日俄戰後。日人圖謀侵我東北之野心益急。經多次之交涉。乃於淸宣統元年與日訂圖們江中韓界務條欵。及東三省交涉五案條欵。以安奉路之改築及撫順烟台兩煤礦之採掘權爲交換。日人始承認延邊四縣爲我領土。該約承認圖們江北岸之地爲雜居地。中韓兩國人民。於此須受同一之待遇。韓人得此便利。遷來者乃更多。自日併韓。日人移殖韓士。韓人乃被迫渡鴨綠江圖們江以入東北。適其時我邊地開發。又正在在需人。於是韓人之移來。遂多如過江之　。村落相望。星羅棋布矣。民元以來。韓人在日本移民政策之下。以其政治勢力爲後援。益以半官式之東方拓殖公司。與南滿鐵路公司等經濟之協助。於是向東北之移殖。大有與年俱增之勢。據日本方面調查。延邊一隅。韓人流動之狀况。約如下表。</p>
<p>韓國人口</p>
<p>年度　年度末人口　年度之增减　每年之增减率</p>
<p>民國元年　一六三·○○○</p>
<p>五年　二○三·九六一　（十）四○·四二六　○·一九九</p>

<p>就上所述之延邊韓民移殖之歷史。實爲韓民侵入我東北之濫觴。亦卽以此爲移殖之中心地而蔓延各處。釀成我東北今日心腹之大患。如此嚴重之邊疆問題。乃延擱至數十年之久。不謀所以解决。是則今日萬寳山案件之發生。豈偶然哉。</p>
<p>（四）韓民移殖東北之現狀</p>
<p>韓民移殖我東北之歷史。旣已略如上述矣。積數十年以至今日。我土地膏腴物産饒富之東北大陸。乃一若此「衣冠古樸」三韓孑遺之第二故鄉。由三韓腹地各道遷徙而來之韓民、大有日增月益之趨勢。數目字增加之速、至爲可驚。臥榻之旁。任人酣睡。甚且越俎代庖。反客爲主。主權喪失。隱患無窮。此問題之嚴重。眞令吾人不寒而慄。</p>
<p>吾人欲明瞭韓人在我東北活動之現狀。當首先考察現時僑寓東北之韓人。究以何地爲最多。其數目究有幾何。我國家對於各種統計。素不注意。迄至今日。各城市之中外人口。尚乏精確之統計。其於東北邊陲。窮鄉僻壤。來無踪去無跡之韓僑。自更不待言。東北當地雖爲調查。但言人人殊。令人無法取捨。日方調查。又每故爲不實之紀載。以淆亂觀聽。更難憑信。無已。請就各方面統計比較而論。以覘其大概。</p>
<p>（一）據長春方面調查　一九二九年末</p>
<p>遼寗省　四五五·一二五人</p>
<p>吉林省　五五六·三二○人</p>
<p>黑龍江省　三六三·二四○人</p>
<p>共計一·三七四·六八五人（見韓國臨時政府編之東三省韓僑問題）</p>
<p>（二）據瀋陽方面調查　一九三○年初</p>
<p>三省共計一百三十萬（見同書）</p>
<p>（三）據東三省入籍韓族同鄉會調查一九二五年</p>
<p>遼寗省　五十萬人　入籍者一萬人</p>
<p>吉林省　七十萬人　入籍者十萬人</p>
<p>黑龍江省　十萬人入籍者五千人</p>
<p>總計　一百三十萬人入籍者十一萬五千人</p>
<p>（四）據東鐵經濟局調查　一九二九年</p>
<p>一寄居於市街内者　三八一六三人</p>
<p>二寄居於腹地内者　五二一九二九人</p>
<p>共計　五六○·九一人</p>
<p>以上四種統計。爲時都在一九二九年至三○年之間。最少數爲五六○·○九一人。最多數爲一·三七四·六八五人。相差甚遠。何者可靠。殊難斷定。又據今年二月二日申報載哈爾濱通信有云。「自民九迄今。韓民爲日政府驅迫。名爲移殖到東北者。計在三百七十餘萬以上。」則與上所列。相差尤巨。總之。上列各種數字。雖不能以某種爲準。要之今日東北韓僑數目。至少總在一百三十萬至二百萬之間。如此巨額之外民移殖。洵爲世界各國所未有。其關係於我東北前途之重大。固不必待有識者始知之也。</p>
<p>至於韓人在東北之分佈狀態。據日本領事館調查。有如下表。</p>
<p>地域　韓人</p>
<p>南滿鐵路沿綫　三九·五三一</p>
<p>遼寗　一三五·二四五</p>
<p>吉林　五四·六六一</p>
<p>間島　三八二·三九○</p>
<p>黑龍江　七·四四九</p>

<h3>三角游泳賽美國高占鰲頭</h3>
<p>丨共得四十三分丨</p>
<p>日本隊第二……三十七分</p>
<p>中華隊第三……十七分</p>
<p>▲克立斯百碼蛙式造成上</p>
<p>海新紀錄</p>
<p>中日美三角角游泳賽、昨晚八時在西靑會游泳池</p>
<p>舉行、二小時内、三國比軍、互相爭雄、結果、美國隊以四十三分獲得冠軍、日本隊第二、三十七、中華隊第三、十四分、大戰閉幕、由該會總幹事費吳生給奬、</p>
<p>▲競賽之性質</p>
<p>此次三角式之競賽、均各以體育機關爲立塲、中華隊由中華游泳研究會臨時組織物别隊、日本則以日本體育協會俱名、美國以西靑會會員爲限、名爲中日美三國游泳賽、實際上、乃滬上中日美之三個團體而已、是以三國好手、多未參加者、因限於資格耳、明年斯時、中華全國體育協進會將有舉行盛大無比之萬國游泳會之計劃、茲無適當游泳池、惟有待諸來年耳、</p>
<p>▲新紀錄一項</p>
<p>九項節目、除化式跳水外、其他八項惟百碼蛙式成績最佳、第一美國克立斯之七十七秒、打破一九二丸年十一月十二日、西靑池内奥司脫之七十八秒、造成上海之新紀錄一項、其次百碼自由式三式替泳百碼仰泳比較尚佳、</p>
<p>▲中華不景氣</p>
<p>中華隊選手出塲者、技能佳者不多、精於斯道者袖手旁觀、於是各項競賽中、莫不節節落後、諸選手中、俞斌祺尹衍均湯天涯三人、最高矯健、俞氏出軍不利、上塲受傷、否則或較有精彩耳、</p>
<p>▲美國大發奮</p>
<p>最初三項、美未占利、化式跳水得八分、遂居先著、殆至第七項二百碼替泳、未一人下水在第三人手指未觸池邊之前、被罰取消地位及分數、於是美日分數比例、成三十三對三十、相差旣近、美國努力於最後之二幕、以冀高占鰲頭、第八幕、美國克立斯立下奇功、造成新紀錄、其時美以三分占先、最後一項、美之勝利、固在掌握之中、但仍以奮鬥精神獲居首席、以四十三分得冠軍、</p>
<p>▲日本未得志</p>
<p>各項節目、多係日本拿手、故在參加之初、抱有野心、出席世界運動會之坂倉、亦名列其間、一幕又一幕、日本莫不與美國爭先）且累有超越之勢、乃突然在化式跳水及八百八十碼自由式兩項、受致命傷、終以三十七分落居美國之後、未得志而退、</p>

<h3>盛况空前之台杯决賽英法高下未分</h3>
<p>丨各勝單打一組丨</p>
<p>丨觀者萬五千五丨</p>
<p>巴黎二十四日電　天氣晴和、英法台維斯杯却令治錦標决賽、今爲第一日、在羅蘭加路埸舉行、結果秋色平分、各勝單打一組、</p>
<p>▲盛况空前觀者萬五</p>
<p>離開賽前甚久、運動場早已客滿、觀者約有一萬五千、門外尚有成千成萬、不得其門而入、警察費盡全力維持秩序、場外樹上、累累人滿、警察無法可想、只能任其所之、盛况爲歷史上未有、</p>
<p>▲驚心動魄呼聲雷動</p>
<p>因兩隊之實力平均、而戰前之猛力宣傳、此勝彼負、全場空氣緊張、一時無二、兩方國人之各自助威、狂呼亂喊、聲震天地、驚心動魄、奥斯汀竟因而受驚敗於柯顯脫、白里力持鎭靜、鮑羅屈拉、遂爲之敗、</p>
<p>▲第一第二單打成績</p>
<p>白里（英）（四比六十比六六比○四比六六比四）</p>
<p>（鮑羅屈拉（法））</p>
<p>柯顯脫（法）（三比六土比九六比二六比四）</p>
<p>奥斯汀（英）</p>
<p>▲白里力勝鮑羅屈拉</p>
<p>白鮑一役、第一盤白曾有極佳表演、鮑以六比四、第二盤之十八局、鮑精力俱絶敗、於是第三盤一敗塗地、連失六局、第四盤爭戰劇烈、白里最後一盤以極準確之球而得勝、</p>
<p>▲柯顯脫已恢復原狀</p>
<p>柯奥之戰、柯已完全恢復傷寒症前之原狀、第一盤失敗後、第二盤常進前欄網大施其砲彈殺救、戰至第二十局、柯以十一比九勝、奥斯汀第一盤甚佳、第二盤共有七次佔先、結果失敗、惜哉、最</p>
<p>後二盤、能力全失、</p>
<p>▲勝負須看最後三組</p>
<p>星期六雙打、星期日最後二組單打、第一日單打各勝一組、英國仍力說有得杯之可能、考實力、法國欲勝、誠非易事、觀者之盛、卽因此懷疑心而起之興趣、惟雙打及柯顯脫白里之單打、以法方得勝居多、</p>

<h3>大雨影響交通</h3>
<p>▲京滬火車中斷</p>
<p>京滬路鎭江南門站、及鎭江站間、因連朝大雨、山洪暴發、以致寳蓋山墜道、被冲下山土阻塞、而同時和平門等處路軌、亦被水冲毁、因此各車均被阻滯等情、已誌昨報、茲將昨日情形、續誌於次、</p>
<p>▲被災情形　此次被災地點、至爲遼闊、自下蜀站起、幾無一處不受水災、中間最重處爲高資站、水面高出平地約六尺、以致車站人員、無處居住、現均設法遷居四十噸篷車内、下蜀·龍潭·和平門·等處、祗被水淹及、約深三四尺·堯化門至太平門及棲霞山間、被水冲毁路軌不少、而附近居民房屋等、亦被水冲毁、</p>
<p>漂没無蹤、鎭江及鎭江南門站間之寳蓋山墜道、係因山土鬆動、由水冲下、以致堵塞、同時軌道兩旁土山上泥土、亦隨水勢而下、竟將墜道全部掩没、其傾圯山土、約有二百五十立方、現正由工程處設法開出水溝、引水外出、如無大雨、水勢稍退、則一二日内、卽可直達通車、</p>
<p>▲救險經過　路局於前日下午得訊後、卽轉飭工程處總工程司、星夜前往察看災形、車務總段長陳鍾英亦同往、一面卽電集全路小工、集中鎭江南門站待命、鎭江分段工程司、又於昨晨、親坐摇車、冒雨赴各站調查、俾便分段動工、而南京方面、面時亦由駐京工程司、於昨晨由南京站起、督率小工、設法在軌道近旁、溝通水道、引水外出、一面令飭各道房小工、查看軌道、並從事修理、尚幸該段内、並無山土阻塞、較爲易於動工、故至昨日下午六時許、幾已全部出險、惟鎭江一段、因山土關係、又加地處多山、開溝不易、而　起軌内山土、更爲費時、故一時尚難恢復、大約再待一二日方可竣工、至於沿途被災居民等損失、不計其數、現下尚難統計、</p>
<p>▲行車狀况　昨日間（廿五日）該路上下行客車均照常、惟祗駛至鎭江南門站爲止、鎭江與南京間交通、完全暫停、預計今日起、鎭江南京間可恢復交通、鎭江與鎭江南門站間、如日内無大雨、水勢稍退、一二日内亦可疏通、今日各車、仍祗往來上海與鎭江南門站間云、鎭江一帶仍在下雨、惟南京雨勢已稍殺、</p>
<p>▲内河小輪全停</p>
<p>連日大雨、蘇浙内河交通、大受影響、各路小火輪、完全停班、記者昨特赴内河各輪局、實地調查、茲將所知狀况、分述如後、</p>
<p>▲湖班全停　滬上行駛湖州班輪、共有早晚班輪六家、本月六號水漲時、早班輪雖停、而夜班仍開、且嘉湖線·錫湖線·各輪、均未受阻、及上星期以水勢略退、早班輪亦可復航、詎自二十以後、大雨不止、湖州方面、水勢更漲數尺、將與橋面平齊、水警已奉到建廳、禁航命令、扣至昨日、不獨上海早夜班六線全停、卽嘉湖蘇湖·錫湖·等船、亦完全止航、</p>
<p>▲蘇輪全停　本埠内河各輪局據報、邇日大雨不止、繼續停航者、有蘇錫班·蘇常班·蘇塍班·鎭靑班·崑山班·錫漂班·澄錫班·宜興等等、共計三十餘條、内河航線、業已完全停阻、其停航原因、有下列兩種、（一）水與田岸將齊、鄉民不許行、（二）水漲後小輪不能過橋、</p>
<p>▲滬輪停開　蘇州河一帶、爲内地小輪集中地、有招商·源通·瑞生祥·正昌·立興·慶記·永順·永安·裕通·等各輪局、航路遍江浙兩省、扣至昨日　各該輪已完全停業、各碼頭滿泊小輪與公司船貨船、有百餘艘、因各輪不開、影響及於碼頭小工之生計、亦甚巨大、</p>
<p>▲招商損失　内河招商局、共有二十六條航路、昨據該局職員言、在江蘇境内之航輪、因大水而停班者、已有二十三路、祇留申蘇·申杭·及申角·三線、尚可勉强通行、昨日蘇州班輪又不能開出、杭州班輪重偁、尚可行駛、輕偁則不能開、</p>
<p>、總局方面、自本月六號至今、此二十天中、受大水停航之影響、已損失八千餘元、分局損失尚不在内、</p>
<p>▲滬宜航空暫停</p>
<p>中國航空公司上海至宜昌航空線、因霪雨連朝、不利飛行、且南京明孝陵飛機塲已成澤國、飛機到站不能起落、不得已於昨日暫停飛行、須視天氣再行恢復、</p>
<p>▲租界電話被阻</p>
<p>昨晨大雨傾盆雷電交作時、法租界寗波路東西自來火街一帶、電話局所裝電話線、忽然損壞、因之昨晨起至旁晚時、該處電話用戸、均欲打電話而不通、聞電話公司、現正在派工匠趕緊修理、大約今日可望恢復原狀、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>减肥新法</p>
<p>過於肥胖的人。無不痛恨他們的一身肉。而千方百計的要它减瘦下去。最近又發明一種新的减肥方法。就是持久的彈奏鋼琴、（批亞拿）據說有意想不到的效力。澳洲昆斯蘭Ｏueesland地方。有一個人曾繼續的彈奏鋼琴。至於八十六小時又十五分鐘之久。打破世界以前的一切紀錄。可是在這時期之間。他的體重竟减去了十三磅之多。要是能常川如此。似乎不難使一個肥人變爲瘦人。此外又有一個方法。更是大發脾氣。暴跳如雷。也可以减少體重。不過家裏的人一定見了頭痛。而左右鄰舍也難免要提出抗議了。</p>
<p>利物浦的鬼屋</p>
<p>英國利物浦Ｌiverpool地方。有一座很優美的屋子。下臨蘭谷倫山谷。Ｖale　of　Liangollen風景極美。現在利物浦女子俱樂部聯合會中許多女郎。都前去消夏。住宿在那裏。但是這屋子向有鬼屋之稱。因爲在一百年前建築的時候。屋主是一個極講衞生的醫生。特在牆上開了許多窟窿。以通空氣。於是每遇發風的日子。大風從窟窿中刮入。有如鬼哭。附近的人紛紛稱說。指爲鬼屋。可是在數年以前。將窟窿完全砌没。聲響也就没有了。世間一切的所謂鬼屋。都可作如是觀。</p>
<h3>我所見的南京</h3>
<p>— ＵＢ</p>
<p>在淸末南京有三多。一臭虫多。二暗娼多。三候補道多。至民國後又有所謂三不。一電燈不明。二電話不靈。三道路不平。蓋皆恰到好處的批評也。</p>
<p>自南京成爲首都。一切外表已大改舊觀。電燈明亮。電話自動。道路寬廣。至於臭虫之多。已著聞全世界。鼎鼎大名的南京蟲。决非旦夕間所能殲滅的。至暗娼之多。是與明娼之禁遏成爲反比例的發展。非俟民生問題全部解决。不易根本除滅。惟候補道當然已絶迹。現在要說是職員多皮帶多了。我們試一至游戲塲或電影園略一停立。便可見掛徽章佩皮帶者之觸目皆是。</p>
<p>芥川龍之介有「南京之基督」。西洋教士游歷南京者常有南京人之描寫。外國人對於南京人的印象。幾乎全看做猙獰可怕奸詐鄙惡的人物。</p>
<p>去年有一位耶教傳道者曾寫了一篇游歷南京後之感想。其中有幾句話是實在情形。他說南京是一個暴發戸。下至洋車夫都挾了一種蠻横倨傲的態度。車價起碼要銀洋二角。少則掉頭不顧。或者投你以冷酷譏笑的眼光。</p>
<p>衣食住三件事的代價。年來繼長增高。民國十九年的生活費比民國十五年貴了一倍。比民國八九年貴兩倍。比民國元二年貴了三倍。至於比起淸朝末年至少增高了十部以上。</p>
<p>現在南京女傭的最低値要月薪六元。十年前祇須六分之一便已僱得到了。年節須要索犒費。買菜吃錢是天經地義。</p>
<p>你上街買點應用的東西。往往碰到敲竹槓的機會。譬如你用銀角去買東西。每一角祇能算九分大洋。但是你要給他大洋找錢。他便要告訴你每銀角一枚照市價要合到九分三厘譬如你買五角錢的東西。他找你是小洋五角。銅元十枚。但你要給他角洋非給他小洋五角銅元十五枚不可。其矛盾有如是者。南京人的商業道德。可見一斑。</p>
<h3>王正廷氏之嗜好</h3>
<p>外交部長王儒堂氏。昨日適屆五十攬揆之辰。其友好僚屬。擬醵金爲其稱觴。王氏固辭。遂偕夫人。公子等赴杭。轉莫干山避壽。當此天災·人禍·内憂·外患交迫之際。王氏能體會時艱。摒除陋俗。可謂識時俊傑。頃據某君述其生平嗜好數事。錄之以實本談。</p>
<p>王氏善飲。尤喜紹興酒。雪茄亦不常離口。談鋒甚健。杯酒之餘。議論滔滔。莊諧雜作。宛如風起雲生。聞者翕服。精騎術。昔年。馳騁郊野。爲其晨課。近以公務繁冗。此調不彈已久。惟網球·彈子·考而夫等。則公餘之暇。輒與朋董爲之。王氏雖身膺重寄。公私所覊。日無暇晷。而體魄碩健。精神飽滿者。蓋得力於戸外運動爲多也。</p>
<h3>日人在滬求知商情之可驚</h3>
<p>— 紓</p>
<p>我人求知慾的强烈。如靑年追求異性一般熾熱。他們求知東北。事無大小。都是刻苦的追求。澈底的研究。這樣。自然是懷着東北算他們「爼上肉」的單戀。嚇。你瞧。日本保護下殖民地的朝鮮。霹靂一聲。猛烈排華。這便是日人有計劃有次序的單戀謀華的出發點。國人若仍内閧。不禦外侮。那麽「有志者事竟成。」倭人魂思夢想的東北。怕不成了這句話的事實嗎。日人不但有鯨吞東北的相思。並有囊括長江的惡念。再進一步言。非到席捲全中國不止。觀於日人在滬的行動。就可以曉得他們的隂謀。原來滬上的日商組合。雇有華人數名。日事調查各華商店。資本若干。股東幾位。姓甚名誰。每年榮業數目幾何。盈虧如何。某貨爲某帮所歡迎。某物銷某埠爲最盛。此數華員。終朝奔波。歷十餘年如一日。（我所曉得的工作年份）直到現在。還是努力地工作不輟。凡此報告。經日人整理後。分門别類。製就表册。做他們商戰的軍用地圖。直接的輸送出産到傾銷地。這麽一來。售賣華商。因手續簡便。成本較輕。自然樂爲日人商戰最前綫的衝鋒隊了。日人的商戰勝利。豈不是「如操左券」嗎。等到勝利以後。料想要將在朝鮮所演「香伙趕出和尚」的一齣戲。再在中國内地來一下子。有人說我。忒嫌煩心。因爲這是商業化。與日軍閥化無關。我道。哼哼。别糊塗吧。人家一心一德。上呼下應。站在一條戰線上謀我。不像我們又散漫又膚淺又守着「各人自掃門前雪」的古訓。而無覺悟無進步的民族。</p>
<h3>幸福之連索</h3>
<p>— 小蝶</p>
<p>近來屢得友人寄來幸福之連索之函其辭云。「此連索能使人得到最良之嘉福及幸運。彼此轉寄。不得中輟。否則否運立至。此連索係一美國陸軍上校所發明。其意欲使此索繞地球三匝。立有奇效。並將此索抄錄九份。分寄與心中欲使其得幸運之好友九人。在寄出九天丙、寄出人必能得極愉快而滿意之事。屢試屢騐。否則否運立至。」（其下列舉寄索得財及停寄失財之事多則）此函近於親友家累見不鮮。且已遍於全國。擴展力之偉大可想。僕不敢冀非份之佳運。故迄未轉寄。而否運亦迄未見乘。獨深思發明此發明連索之人。用意果何在。雖屬兒戲。而擴展力之迅速偉大。若利用之賑災慈善事業。則數百萬金誠可咄嗟立辦也。蓋九人連索之法。卽以一化十十化百百化千千化萬也。此連索但須經十次之擴展。爲數卽得一百萬萬。每一寄函之人。令得函者納賑一文於函中指定之所。而更照錄此函謄錄分寄九人。其後輾轉亦復如之。則百日之内。卽可得錢一百萬萬。合之銀元三千萬矣。當此水旱匪災遍於全國。賑濟乏救。有心者胡不捨無益之戲。而一注意及此乎。但有同志十人。登高一呼。彌月之間。卽奏大效矣。</p>
<h3>夜宿棺柩之怪翁</h3>
<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>江隂某鄉有某翁者。家小康。惟生性怪僻。彼於臥室前。停置壽器一具。天暮。則蜷宿其中。蓋藉此作臥榻。而室内床帳反虛設焉。一夕。有客某甲迷途。登門求宿。家人不敢應。而甲因宵深無處棲止。哀懇益急。乃憫而謂之曰。後室固有一餘榻。特榻前置柩。夜間輒有駭人事。君苟膽壯。就宿可也。甲無奈。入室就燈讀易。倦卽埀帳而寢。夜午。有悉索聲起於柩中。甲屏息自帳幕中覘其異。須臾。一長髯翁揭柩蓋而出彳亍至榻前。翻易而讀。讀畢仍歸原處。甲益駭怪。然不敢聲。迨曉·甲起身欲行。忽有附背者曰。君盍果腹去。甲顧而視之。大驚欲遁。蓋卽隔宿柩中出現者。旋經翁詳述所以。並謂柩蓋乃黑紗所蒙·故啓用便捷。因相與莞爾。不侫曰。方今盜賊衆多。彼富有資産而夜不安枕者。正不妨效某翁故智。藉保安全也。一笑。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（六九）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二日復詣沙那（卽鹿苑）登一塔。此地共有三塔。一在北。爲圓錐形磚塔。不可上。二爲尖塔。在西。亦難上。三爲兩層塔。在西南。去古物院不遠。惟此塔爲可登也。塔在大道旁。美樹多蔭。旁有住家。余置所乘之脚踏車於井側。乃西上登此塔。旁有牌。英文云。Ｃhankhandhi　Stuptu蓋塔名也。此牌均大乘佛會所製。塔之下有洞。亦可入。但因亂磚堆積。未暇入也。登其第二層。已至頂。高約四五丈。然在曠野可望一切。但見天雲相連。萬樹森森。間以民居與麥田。南望波羅奈。見烟突。東西北方皆曠野。由來印度教罕見大塔如中國者。塔亦甚少。中國塔勝於印度。此塔乃佛說大法興象教之發祥地也。乃書詩四句於塔卜層之北門上。因無毛筆。用自來水筆書之。僅可辨字。若有華人來。可認也。其詩云。「象教發源五比丘。鹿園佛跡至今留。美禽嘉樹應如昨。脚下雲生五大洲。」</p>
<p>塔頂直線可四步。將來華人來學於此。可更建一層以廣之。足以爲休息之良地也。聞昔時五比丘住此。蓋二千餘年。可謂古寄宿舍矣。至大學。與法師談。云此中間尖塔爲佛初說法處。又許多廟蹟乃阿輸迦王與以後某王所建。今壞已二千年。無人問矣。然其磚尚多完好。何古人工程之堅也。余問其印度究尚有僧人否。答近加市之孟加拉省。有乞里千Ｃhilagon國。尚有僧人。因佛本迦比羅市人。此市乃屬此國所管。據學生云。今其國尚有百萬人。有佛教僧可百人也。火車可通。距加爾吉打不過二百英里云。余問其大乘小乘所由分。據云佛滅度初有大會結果。其後二百年阿輸王時代。又大會結集。彼時有畏老派率一部分弟子結集。而爲小乘派。其少年者結合而爲大乘派。本來小乘派之原名。爲長老派之意。可證明也。至其宗旨之殊。則長老派堅守淸眞修行。不雜以方便法。若大乘派則演成多神。又與印度教化合。乃方便法也。二派之不同如此。余乃返印度校。夕陽西下。牛羊各歸家。落葉紛紛。似告佘一切法音之無常者。途經基督教會。晤英女士數人與印度女教士。彼告我數段聖經。可證明女子管理世界。足以去兵殺者。遂歸。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>？？？（三三）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>古人說：春宵一刻値千金，夏夜難道不値半文錢麽？」</p>
<p>子良不語，上床躺下了。夫人也接着上去，子良讓到裏床去，忽然覺得身體底下，有一樣高高的什麽東西。伸手去一摸，摸得一手都是很濕的，不好了！什麽東西呢？拏出來一看，原來是一大塊奶油蛋糕，一半粘在子良短衫上，一半還在褥子上。</p>
<p>這是方才夫人留在枕畔自己吃的，不知怎樣弄到下面去了，此刻夫人一見，拍手大笑，子良只得脫去短衫，再用短衫去揩褥子，夫人並不來帮助他。</p>
<p>揩乾凈了！子良方始再躺下去，夫人見子良一味不開口，便嘮嘮叨叨，說個不住，子良也不聽伊，心中暗暗的想道：</p>
<p>「我今天一天工夫，本來想利用着休假，把學生的作文薄一百六十多本改完的；那知被伊一味來胡纒，弄得我一些工夫也没有，頭腦早被伊閙昏了，身體也疲乏了，那裏可以下筆呢？可憐：我在署假以前，再要這麽一個星期日，已經是没有的了。這美麗的惡魔，伊實在不明白我有重要的工作，伊來與我胡閙，算是一種義務的，算是一種趣味的，唉！</p>
<p>一個男子，爲什麽要有妻？</p>
<p>人家的妻？也是這樣的麽？</p>
<p>這就是所謂家庭之幸福麽？」（完）</p>

<p>昨日英美印錦市均已報升、惟市面尚平、美國又存觀望、英美匯兌亦漲、於是滬市未有影響、匯豐掛牌僅法郎加二元、日匯回小二五、計一兩六錢四分五、餘無變化、殆銀行内盤似乎秀利、而盤頭甚微、乃金市續呈佳况、故午時收盤與前晚比較、計英金縮○六二五、英金一二五、日匯加一分、外减内增之異趨耳、華商如成豐永·福昌及大連帮等稍有扒結、英金惟數不多、約共成交十餘萬鎊、内有各行互做數萬鎊、又美金由美日等商對做二三十萬元、又國外馬尼賴埠來電賣出現期、至於東匯殊少出納、下午因達週末無市、</p>

<h3>厘拆市闃無聲臭</h3>
<p>▲市塲概况　昨値星期六、銀行方面例無下午業務、金融界以黨此夏令、本屬慘淡、更以週末休假、益覺冷靜逾恒、錢莊方面、市塲交易亦與平常略遜、市價大都安謐、惟銅元略覺放長耳</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格　「洋厘」早市釐價爲七錢二分五厘、較前日午市略小二毫半、早市則加昂三毫七忽半、爲七錢二分五厘三毫七忽半、結果反好一毫二忽半、「銀拆」早午兩市均開五分、較前日小去二三分、劃頭加水亦爲五六分、</p>

<h3>證劵　債市日見低落</h3>
<p>昨日債劵期市沉靜、賣買閒散、前後市盤旋而無大漲落、但債市環象雖無重大變化、而以北方石軍叛亂、粤局猶未解决、討赤亦結束有待、市上人心、不免虛弱、投資收進、不若先前之踴躍、而手有現貨零星售出者、則仍有之、此日來債價之所以盤旋日低也、昨上落雖微、而盤旋漸低如故、結果較前日復小一二角至半元許不等、計期貨交易一千四百八十餘萬元、現貨前後市概無交易、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市暫歸恬靜</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、本有趨跌之慮、因海外花紗狀况一味傾向下游、但抵貨舉動依然緊張、而本紗買價較昂、開盤難以大落、兩相抵直、然多數預想國内水災已成、將後農民購買力較弱、對於實銷大受損失、所以抛賣者尚不乏人、</p>
<p>▲人標市氣鬆懈　交易所人標前市開盤、形勢平平、以外棉大跌、市氣鬆懈、各月跌一二三錢、午後仍平、各月微跌一錢、成交計二萬八千八百五十包、查買出泰興一千二百五十包、恒德六百包、益昶七百包、同餘九百五十包、買進大孚六百五十包、廣豐二千三百包、長豐一千一百包、裕大一千一百五十包、吉豐八百包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市無大上落</h3>
<p>美棉跌風又熾、印棉亦步塵於後、致人心難免疲弱、然大雨不止、國内水災已成、棉田損害不淺、故内地帮均來電購買、但本埠火機帮因價格已在相當中、大批套賣、包額殊巨、市面受其壓迫、午後遂告回落、</p>
<p>▲漢標火機帮抛賣　交易所漢標前市開盤、本有激漲之力、以外棉不佳人心軟疲、各月漲一二錢、收盤回跌一錢、午後因火機帮賣出而跌、收盤雨聲不停稍漲、結果跌五分、成交計九萬八千六百擔、查賣出新亨五千六百擔、德記二千八百擔、利昌二千擔、餘昶二千擔、長豐二千六百擔、天隆一千八百擔、買進公泰三千五百擔、恒益二千四百擔、大昶三千一百擔、長豐二千九百擔、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食　天雨河貨未開斛</h3>
<p>▲四日來米價漲起二元左右</p>
<p>▲新閘　昨因天雨、河下船貨不能開斛、但做開者祗有萬盛泰·裕昶祥二家、厚粳薄稻喊起三四角、比四日前米價、步增二元左右、昨日做開者右祖眞眞特頂粳開盤十五元八角、王坤市高粳十五元二角、諸友根薄稻十四元四角、祗有三筒、明日開斛、西路來源、計崑山·角里·江隂·望亭等四五號、</p>
<p>▲南市　豐記碼頭昨日早晨臨市者人數稀少、棧臺上因大雨不止、全無成交、故無市報告、西路乏船抵埠、人心恐惶、連日暴雨、内地秧苗損失、形勢續見飛增、</p>
<h3>麥市繼續騰踊</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、又飛騰不已、實因天雨未停、災象日烈、已熟未熟之田稻、已受巨大之影嚮、致内地客戸、一致不限市價、紛紛暢進、雖洋麥又訂成澳麥一船、約計七千噸、合價祗四兩一錢七分、亦全力套出、無如買進者不問國外之情形、雖就目前水災爲比較、因之市面未能抑遏、反步步高昂、此種狀况、爲最近所罕見也、結果本月份較前日漲三分、八月份漲四分、九月份漲六分、十月份漲五分、十一月份漲六分、十二份漲五分、現麥高廠胃不暢、依然平穩、開南京鎭江外岡蓬萊黄渡嘉定麥一千九百包、由華豐福新信大等廠辦去云、</p>
<h3>粉市漲風益銳</h3>
<p>▲内地帮買氣日熾</p>
<p>昨日粉市又趨步漲之象、因大雨未停、日夜傾盆、各處災象、日趨嚴重、故内地帮買氣一往直前、有再接再厲之勢、雖洋麥報價、依然小去二角至四角不等、大小廠家亦均趁勢套出、無如人心方熾、緩不濟急、始終未能減小買戸之盛氣、如半日成交、亦達一百四十餘萬、可見雙方爭競烈矣、考此種景象、將使外麥之來源、愈定愈之盛也、結果本下月份較前日各漲一分七厘半、九月份漲二分二厘半、十月份漲二分、十一月份漲一分七厘半、十二月份漲二分二、</p>
<h3>絲茶　雙宫繭貨缺價俏</h3>
<p>▲普通開八十五南　▲又漲起二三兩</p>
<p>今歲江浙各屬繭産奇歉、雙宫繭産額亦减、而日商在滬放價搜購、致存底益薄、供不敷求、價益俏利、昨日雙宫絲廠進無錫普通雙宫繭二百四十八擔、價開八十五兩、較前又漲二三兩云、</p>
<h3>黄白廠經歐銷停滯</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、益形寂寞、查歐美市塲、黄白廠經實稍不動、去電均不見轉、市氣沈寂、昨祗怡和等進白乾經十五包、永興進黄搖經十包、價均堅挺云、</p>
<h3>針眉綠茶法銷暢達</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、路莊土莊等路之針眉綠茶、怡和·協和·天祥·同孚等行、均起搜辦、交易尚不寂寞、售盤亦頗爲堅挺、高莊珍眉綠茶、永興保昌等行、亦略有進胃、市况無變動、低莊貢熙、昨市白頭莊瑞昌洋行又復開辦、全市成交五百餘箱、價開三十一兩、較前約低一二兩、惟上中莊貨、尚未見有成交云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新蘭花子開價奇昂</h3>
<p>厦門橘餅、邇來到貨甚稀、而地頭存底至缺、辦價頻升、查前日到有三十七件、昨聞業已開出、品佳者價爲二十兩許、次之二十一兩零半、比前升起一兩、蘭花子斷檔已久、現値出新之際、前日僅到二箱、故頗爲希罕、開價竟達五十五兩、爲從來未有之高價、後市多到看鬆、</p>
<h3>糖市　各務靑已有運到</h3>
<p>▲劃盤各糖銷呆市沉</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價未有變更、紐約期糖九月份升二分、十二月份跌一分、三五月份亦跌二分、爪哇現期糖亦無起伏、公會劃盤、以各處去化轉呆、市氣因以萎頓、荷糖二十四號</p>
<p>粗砂白十一兩四錢半、中砂白十兩零九錢半、均少受手、磨中砂白十一兩零五分、雖略有成交、額亦微稀、市形亦平、太古糖問津亦寂、Ｂ嘜略有交易、價爲十二兩、比前回跌一錢、冬務靑市存殊寥、昨運到三千件、同時碗靑亦到一千四百餘袋、以應市消云、</p>
<h3>五金　紫銅兵工廠昨有電辦</h3>
<p>昨日大雨滂沱、五金市因受其影響、益覺蕭條、查全市除花色貨有點綴外、大批交易依然無多、惟南京兵工署昨日來電辦去紫銅五十噸、交易稍見活潑、别貨依然滯呆、行市亦鮮有進出、惟東貨五金進口連日仍見踴躍、各同業因不能推銷内地、故均在預備登記云、</p>

<p>Donggu Is No Longer Defensible</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanchang telegram: (1) Sun Lianzhong's troops joined forces with Luo Lin's division in Xiaopu and Huangpi, and are advancing westward towards Xingguo from Ningdu. The left and right wings have already joined forces in Xingguo. Bandits fleeing south from Donggu have nowhere to go and can be captured soon. Ruijin is under heavy siege. The Zhu bandits are leading over 20,000 defeated troops, fleeing to Changting, attempting to join forces with the Fujian bandits. Tens of thousands of defeated bandits from Longgang are fleeing to Ruijin and Huichang via Yudu. The left-wing army is attacking from Longlin, causing the bandits to trample each other, with numerous deaths and injuries. Fang Zhimin led his troops to attempt to attack northern Fujian and Yuncheng again on the 24th, but was intercepted and defeated by Qian Yuguang and has now retreated back to the border between Jiangxi and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>(2) Chen Cheng and Jiang Dingwen's divisions launched a fierce attack on Donggu at dawn on the 23rd. The bandits defending the nest attempted to flee towards Xingguo but were driven back by our troops. They are now engaged in mountain warfare, and our troops are advancing step by step. The 12th Division has been stationed in Baisha and has joined the siege of Donggu.

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Telegram to the People of the Whole Country</h3>
<p>"We Should Strive for Internal Pacification and External Resistance with the Spirit of Sleeping on Brushwood and Tasting Gall"</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang's circular telegram: To all newspapers and compatriots across the country: Since receiving the order to suppress the Communists, Zhongzheng has been in Jiangxi since entering Jiangxi from Nanjing on June 21. I departed from Nanchang on the 2nd of this month to inspect the front lines and stationed myself in Nanfeng to personally supervise the various armies and actively suppress the bandits. Consequently, Lichuan was recovered on the 4th, and Guangchang and Shicheng were recovered on the 13th. The details of the battles have been reported separately. We immediately took advantage of the victory to pursue relentlessly. On the 19th, we captured Ningdu, the general nest of the Red bandits. All the captives and disbandment situations have also been reported separately. The Red bandits have been repeatedly tracked down and fiercely attacked by our army. The remaining remnants were already less than 10,000 people. When they fled in a panic towards Huichang and Tingzhou, they were attacked and intercepted by local militias along the way, leaving even fewer survivors. It is expected that they will be completely annihilated within this month in order to eliminate the major fundamental problem of the country. Unexpectedly, just as the officers and soldiers of our Communist suppression army were driving and galloping in Jiangxi and Fujian, penetrating deep into the bandit areas, braving the heat, enduring hunger, bandaging wounds, and bleeding, fighting a desperate battle with the Red bandits, I suddenly received reports of the Korean僑胞惨案in Korea, the rebellion of Shi Yousan, and the invasion of Hunan and Jiangxi by the rebellious factions of Guangdong and Guangxi. Zhongzheng rushed back to Nanchang overnight to review reports from all sides. I learned that Shi's rebellion was actually bought by the rebels in Guangdong for 500,000 yuan, and that officers of imperialist countries and leaders of the Jiangxi bandits were entering and leaving his army, presiding over the situation, secretly echoing the aggression of imperialists and the disturbances of the Red bandits in Jiangxi and Hubei. Also, in the headquarters of the Red bandits in Ningdu, we found a telegram from Mao Zedong to Peng Dehuai, which stated that Guangdong and Guangxi would send troops to Hunan and Jiangxi within a month, supplying 500,000 rounds of ammunition, which could be delivered from Jiaying immediately. Our army must hold Ningdu firmly for half a month, and when the Guangdong army enters Jiangxi, we can lift the siege and launch a counterattack. There are countless other hidden messages and telegrams concerning the connection between Guangdong and Guangxi and the Red bandits, which will be reported later. Furthermore, according to reports intercepted by Chairman Yang of Fujian, it is also confirmed that the Red bandits and Guangdong and Guangxi had reached a tacit agreement long ago, which is beyond doubt. At this point, Zhongzheng understood that the rebellions of Guangdong and Guangxi, the rebellion of Shi Yousan, the rampant acts of the Red bandits, and the惨案in Korea were all mutually related. The rebel warlords feared the suppression of the Red bandits, so they sent troops to aid them and rebelled in response. The imperialists feared the elimination of the warlords and the unification of China, so they stirred up diplomatic disputes to restrain us. Our Communist suppression officers and soldiers are exposed to the wind and dew, spending nights in the open, enduring sun and rain, with blackened faces, bravely overcoming all difficulties, and determined to die, fighting with the Red bandits for the final fate. But the warlords are supplying the Red bandits with weapons and ammunition to prolong their lingering existence. Our compatriots across the country are running around and appealing in unison to resist the aggression of the imperialists, but the warlords are instead raising troops and causing chaos, willingly becoming tigers for the imperialists. Alas, people's hearts are dead, and the country will be destroyed soon! I did not expect the rebels to be so insane. I once read the saying, "People must insult themselves before others insult them, and a country must attack itself before others attack it." I cannot help but feel endless sorrow for our country and nation. What is more tragic, painful, and dangerous than this? At this time, when the Red bandits, warlords, rebels, and imperialists are jointly attacking, in this autumn when life and death are imminent, all compatriots across the country should strive for internal pacification and external resistance with the spirit of sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, and with the perseverance of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, to wash away the century-old shame of the party and the country. To resist external aggression, we must first pacify the internal affairs, and to eliminate corruption, we can prevent termites. Without the rebellion in Guangdong, the Korean慘案would not have occurred, and the issue of recovering legal rights would have been resolved long ago. The abolition of unequal treaties would be undoubtedly. Therefore, without first eliminating the Red bandits and restoring the vitality of the nation, we cannot resist foreign aggression. Without first suppressing the rebels and completing the unification of the country, we cannot resist external aggression. When people love the country, they should have the same heart. "Fighting among ourselves and resisting external aggression" is a clear lesson from ancient times. In this autumn when the country is in danger and the nation is in crisis, anyone with a national concept and nationalistic ideology and who is a believer in the Three People's Principles, as long as they can abandon their prejudices and jointly resist external aggression to save the party and the country, Zhongzheng will regard them as loyal comrades and will compromise to follow them. As for the personal advancement, retreat, and departure, I no longer care about them. Zhongzheng only seeks that the national law and party discipline can be illuminated for future generations, and will not destroy them because of personal reasons, so as to avoid endless disputes and the tragic fate of the country's destruction for a hundred years. I will not allow Zhongzheng to be a criminal who destroys the law and is irresponsible. If the current disputes are resolved through legal procedures, then Zhongzheng will obey the party's orders in the morning and resign in the evening, and will never change his mind. Otherwise, if rebellion is used as a means to seize power and betraying the country is used as a path to success, then Zhongzheng can only fulfill my revolutionary responsibility. All those who are tools of the imperialists and traitors to the party and the country are scourges of the country and the nation, and I will not show any leniency. I will destroy them and clean them up in order to establish the foundation of the party and the country, and to eliminate the ambitions of international aggression. Then the country will have hope for independence, and the nation will have a day of freedom. Alas, the foreign troubles are becoming more urgent, the national situation is in danger, overseas compatriots are being slaughtered, and the country's territory is being invaded. The day when the country is destroyed and the people have no means of livelihood is near. I only hope that all compatriots across the country will understand the right and wrong, distinguish the advantages and disadvantages, uphold justice, and save the country from danger, so as to fulfill the duty of the people. Maintain calmness, do not rely on momentary enthusiasm, strictly observe order, and do not lose the demeanor of the people. Against the aggression of the imperialists, we will resist with disciplined action and swear to die. Against the riots of the Red bandits and rebels, we will extinguish them with organized efforts. Zhongzheng has survived hundreds of battles and will not look back. Wherever the public opinion is, I will follow, even to death. I swear to become more invigorated and be a pioneer for the people. I will definitely eliminate the Red bandits in the shortest possible time, protect the lives of the people, suppress the rebellion, and complete the unification. Therefore, as long as the Red bandits are not destroyed for a day, Zhongzheng's responsibility will not be fulfilled for a day. As long as the rebellion is not quelled for a day, Zhongzheng's duty will not be completed for a day. The ancients said, "While there is still a breath, this ambition will not change." Zhongzheng is not smart, but I would like to swear to myself. If I am fortunate enough to succeed, then it will be the blessing of the party and the country and the glory of the nation. If I am unfortunate and fail, then I can only die to repay the country. I hope you will understand my sincerity. Chiang Kai-shek (Seal). (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Encourages the Northeast Generals by Telegram</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed to the Northeast generals, roughly stating that Shi Yousan took advantage of my illness, seized the opportunity to endanger others, and led his troops north. He has the ambition of a wolf and a 子野 and a propensity for chaos. First, he betrayed Feng Huanzhang, then President Chiang, and then Yan Baichuan. He disregards integrity and only seeks profit. Now, he is about to use his old tricks to reach the Northeast. How has the Northeast failed Shi Yousan? He also listed Shi's disloyalty, unrighteousness, unkindness, and untrustworthiness. He concluded by urging the so-called front-line generals to encourage their soldiers, strive to be the first to kill the enemy, and strictly order their troops not to commit the slightest offense. If anyone dares to shrink back, disobey military orders, or disturb the people, the military law will be enforced and there will be no tolerance. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>A Word to the Students Going Abroad</h3>
<p>Since the Qing Dynasty's Wuxu Reform, our country has sent students to study abroad. The number of those going to Europe, America, and Japan has increased dramatically year by year. To date, the number should be very large. Recently, a large number of students studying in the United States are about to depart again. As a reporter, I have some feelings and sincerely offer a word of advice. Our country is fundamentally an agricultural country, but since modern times, influenced by the new tide of the European and American industrial revolution, it has gradually entered the path of an industrial country. During this time of transformation from old to new, the transitional bridge is specialized talent with knowledge of modern industry and natural sciences. This kind of specialized talent is the backbone of building a new society and a new country. Although there is also a need for specialized talent in new politics, economics, law, and training, they all take a secondary position. Therefore, speaking of the current situation in our country, students studying abroad should focus on seeking the above-mentioned industrial and natural science knowledge. Only then can what they learn be put to use, and only then can it truly meet the needs of the country. This is the first thing that this reporter hopes for from today's students studying abroad. It is precisely because our country is in the transitional stage of changing from old to new that there are many problems that require our efforts. Chemistry, various heavy industries, electricity, and all kinds of scientific knowledge are urgently needed foodstuffs for our country. Obtaining these foodstuffs urgently requires the efforts of students studying abroad. Therefore, today's students studying abroad should choose a problem from the problems that our country urgently needs to solve before going abroad, and take it with them on their voyage. During their studies abroad, they should make it their responsibility to acquire the knowledge to solve this problem. Only then will their learning have a goal, and their learning will be worthwhile. This is the second thing that this reporter hopes for from today's students studying abroad. When studying and researching knowledge, the brain and hands should be used simultaneously. Seeking theoretical knowledge is important, but seeking practical experience is also indispensable. The theories in books are dead, while practical actions are alive. Using dead theories in live actions further reveals the truth of the theories. Using live actions to verify dead theories further reveals the effectiveness of the actions. Using only hands will lose knowledge, and using only the brain will lose action. It is necessary to verify what you have learned through action, to be able to know and be able to act. Only then can you be worthy of being specialized talent. Only then can you be useful when you return to your country. If you read ten thousand books and memorize ten thousand theorems, but are at a loss when faced with a task, then you are a dead bookshelf, not a living, practical machine. A bookshelf is really not what our country urgently needs today. Therefore, today's students studying abroad should use both their brains and hands when researching knowledge. Learn theories from books, and seek experience from practice. Study at school on the one hand, and work in factories on the other. Only with this spirit and this effort can you acquire truly useful knowledge. This is the third thing that this reporter hopes for from today's students studying abroad. There are many kinds of practical sciences. If you want to have expertise, it is difficult to know everything. For example, in medicine, there are various departments such as internal medicine, surgery, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, dentistry, and orthopedics. It is definitely difficult for one person to study all departments, and it is even more difficult for one person to treat all departments when opening a hospital. If you gather like-minded people, study different departments, and then take charge of different departments when you put your studies to practice, then things will be easier to accomplish, and the results will be easier to see. Medicine is like this, and other fields are also like this. Therefore, before today's students studying abroad depart, they should choose several like-minded people with the same goal, and focus on one career. Study the various specialized knowledge of its application. For example, in papermaking, some study chemistry, some study machinery, some study factory management, and some study selecting raw materials. When they return to the country after completing their studies, they will each contribute what they have learned and form a factory together. Its success is almost certain. This is the fourth thing that this reporter hopes for from today's students studying abroad. Furthermore, traveling across the ocean involves huge expenses. It is to seek practical knowledge, not to seek empty fame. If you stay without learning, or learn without being practical, and spend several years eating foreign bread and earning a bachelor's or doctoral degree, and then return to show off to your countrymen and boast to your relatives and friends, or even use it as a tool for seeking personal gain, then you are a parasite of our country and of society. Other fields, such as literature, are the least practical. Because it is easy, there are many scholars. This kind of foreign "eight-legged essay" is truly endlessly misleading and should also be given attention by today's students studying abroad. Finally, the reporter sincerely prays that what the students studying abroad will bring back with them in the future is not the empty honor of a doctorate or bachelor's degree, but practical knowledge that will enrich our country and benefit our people's livelihood. Students studying abroad, strive hard!</p>

<p>British Cash Continues to Flow Out</p>
<p>Two German Banks Suddenly Close</p>
<p>Price of German Subsidiary Coins Expected to Rise</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, London, 24th: Representatives of the Seven-Nation Conference and others began to leave England one after another starting this morning. French Foreign Minister Briand was the first to board a train and return to France at around 7:00 AM, followed by the Belgian representatives and others, who left London at around 8:00 AM. Unexpectedly, Sangrandy departed at 4:00 PM. French Prime Minister Laval and the rest of the representatives left in the same car as the German delegation. They all dined together with Biru Ning, Cortius, and others on the English Channel ferry. When the ship reached Calais, they shook hands and said goodbye.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 24th: U.S. Secretary of State Stimson has set out for Berlin for a two-day stay, ending on Sunday. Stimson claims that this trip has nothing to do with financial matters.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 24th: French representative Laval and others returned to the Paris station at 5:40 PM this afternoon. They were welcomed by a large crowd, and the cheers were deafening. After Laval and others arrived in France, they immediately drove to the State Council to report on the London Conference and scheduled a cabinet meeting for tomorrow, asking President Dumer to attend and make another report. French newspapers have very little detailed commentary on the results of this London Conference. It is said that their disapproval is the policy instructed by the government. However, some praised the meeting, saying that it opened up a new path for German-French cooperation.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 25th: The German representatives who attended the London Executive Conference quietly returned to Beijing at 8:00 AM this morning. Prime Minister Biru Ning immediately met with Finance Minister Dietri and Privy Councilor. Then, he decided to convene a cabinet meeting in the afternoon and then met with the President to report on the consultations in Paris and London.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd: This morning, crowds gathered at the Friedrichstrasse station to welcome Prime Minister Biru Ning and Foreign Minister Cortius back to Beijing from England. However, Biru and others got off the train in the countryside of Charlottenburg at 8:18 AM in the morning and changed to cars to go to the office, because it was reported that members of the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party planned to take the opportunity to disturb the situation and make a violent demonstration.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 24th: The resolutions of the Seven-Nation Conference aimed at rescuing the German situation have now reached the stage of practical implementation. The Committee of Financial Experts from Belgium, France, Germany, England, Italy, Japan, and the United States, who are considering the measures necessary to implement President Hoover's overall plan, is now meeting at the British Treasury. British Prime Minister MacDonald, in his capacity as chairman of the London Conference, conveyed the resolutions passed by the conference, namely, asking the Bank for International Settlements to establish a committee to investigate the need for additional loans to the national banks and to study the possibility of converting some short-term debts into long-term debts. The Bank for International Settlements has now replied, saying that it is rushing to proceed, striving to study the best way to implement the conference resolutions within its scope of action. French Prime Minister Laval returned to Paris today, telegraphed to thank the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, and said that he hoped that the results of the discussion could benefit England and France, and also benefit the world. The British Foreign Secretary replied in a telegram, saying that he hoped that the beneficial cooperation that has already begun could continue for a long time to benefit all countries.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 24th: People in London are mostly disappointed with the results of the Seven-Nation Conference's discussion of German affairs. They regard the clause passed by the conference, which advises banks to extend the short-term debts of 20 million pounds owed by the German national banks for three months, and the proposal for joint action by all parties to maintain Germany's existing debts as only temporary measures. However, some bankers believe that the success of the London Conference has not been understood by the general public. Large-scale long-term loans to Germany cannot be achieved under the current situation. However, Germany has at least gained a valuable few months of breathing room.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Rome, 24th: The results of the London Conference have shown considerable dissatisfaction in Italian public opinion, and it is believed that France has actually hindered it, making it difficult to immediately implement measures to rescue German finances. The Italian Asia Daily News stated that although France is trying its best to regard this matter as its own, it does not know that this fact is related to the future of all countries in the world. However, France originally wanted to add a heavier burden to the Germans, and now this wish has not been fulfilled, which is a fortunate thing in misfortune.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 24th: In the past half month, a large number of gold bars from the Bank of England have flowed into France, totaling more than 29 million pounds. What is the reason for this? It is puzzling. Some say that the current financial situation in the United Kingdom is quite stable, and now this sudden outflow is probably related to France's ambiguous political actions. The diplomatic reporter of the Daily Telegraph said that the withdrawal of cash is closely related to the Foreign Secretary's visit to Paris last week. It is said that the British Foreign Secretary used a kind of wording during an important discussion, which the French translated as implying that if Germany stopped paying first, the United Kingdom would follow suit. As a result, the French political and financial circles were greatly alarmed, and the action of loading cash from the United Kingdom immediately broke out. Reuters Paris reported that seven planes transported ten tons of gold from London yesterday. Never before have so much gold been transported in one day.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 24th: The latest result of Germany's financial difficulties is the failure of two banks and the tragic death of a banker. The Berlin Mendelssohn Bank closed its doors because the securities it held could not be quickly sold and it could not cope with the situation. Not long after, the Rudelanh Bank in Munich, which had been open for 50 years, also went bankrupt. Also, the manager of a bank in Frankfurt, which has been established for 136 years, Mr. Weller, has now committed suicide by taking poison.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 24th: According to official estimates, after the German President's order to mint subsidiary coins is implemented, the government will need to purchase at least one million kilograms of large silver bars, which will cost about four million marks at the current silver price. However, this order has been issued for two days and has not yet been implemented. It is also questionable whether enough silver marks will be minted. And even if enough coins are minted, it will take at least two months before they can circulate in the market, and the need to rescue finances at that time will also be less than it is now. Furthermore, the German government has never made public the amount of silver it has, so it is difficult to determine at this time how many silver bars are currently in stock and how many more will need to be purchased when minting coins. However, silver mine owners generally hope that Germany can collect one million kilograms of silver on the market, and if enough coins are minted, it is hoped that it can increase the price of silver. According to the German system, a silver mark contains two and a half grams of pure silver, which is about one-tenth of the face value. The government also makes a huge profit from minting silver coins.</p>
<h3>Great Inventor Edison Is Ill Due to Old Age and Overwork</h3>
<p>Doctors Advise Long-Term Rest</p>
<p>Artificial Rubber Experiment Successful</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, West Orange (New Jersey), 24th: World-renowned inventor Edison, due to excessive labor in experimenting with the cheapest way to extract artificial rubber from goldenrod grass for commercial use, now needs long-term rest. According to his relative Miller, this rest may be the prelude to his retirement. Edison is now 84 years old and has always worked diligently without any rest, often eating and sleeping in the laboratory. He is getting stronger as he gets older, and his spirit of diligence and learning can be a model for young people.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 25th: Recently, there was a communist conspiracy to start an uprising in Korea. After it was discovered by the authorities, the press was prohibited from reporting it. The ban has recently been lifted. It is reported that the Communist Party planned to declare the independence of the peninsula and build a labor government modeled after the Soviet system. 300 people were arrested, and some of them have been convicted in the Seoul court. It is said that the headquarters of the Communist Party is located in Manchuria, outside the Korean border.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Marseille, 24th: A forest fire broke out near here this morning. There was a strong wind at the time, which caused it to spread very quickly. By the time the fire brigade arrived, it was already unapproachable and threatened to reach the city. For a time, the entire city was shrouded in thick smoke, and the situation was very dangerous. The authorities urgently dispatched all the garrison troops to help put out the fire, but it was still to no avail. They immediately organized a volunteer team to rush to the fire line. The local authorities now believe that they can cut off the fire path by dusk. The losses have not yet been ascertained, and it is feared that there will be many dead and injured.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Pittsburgh, USA, 24th: A fire broke out in the men's section of a nursing home tonight, spreading quickly and difficult to extinguish. After it was extinguished, 22 dead were examined, 20 were missing, and over 100 were injured. Another telegram said that the number of dead has now reached 30. When the fire broke out, as many as 15,000 people watched, hindering firefighting efforts.</p>
<h3>Tracking the Graf Zeppelin Airship's Arctic Exploration</h3>
<p>Lindbergh's China Tour Route Undecided</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 25th: The German airship Graf Zeppelin, led by Dr. Eckener, carrying 16 passengers and 30 crew members, 200 kilograms of mail, left Berlin for Leningrad at 4:40 AM this morning. It will take the route through Arkhangelsk to the Arctic Ocean for scientific and meteorological research.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, New York, 24th: American aviator Colonel Lindbergh stated today that the route for his and his wife's flight tour of China will be decided after they reach Japan. Theoretically, after visiting Tokyo, they should first go to Shanghai, but he also urgently wants to see Beiping. He is now considering whether he can land in the Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace, and whether to take the route to Beiping via Seoul first, and then to Shanghai. In short, his return route to the United States will take a new route to avoid monotony. The Lindberghs are scheduled to depart within the next week. The purpose of this trip is to travel, with safety as the priority. It is expected to take at least 12 days from New York to Tokyo. It is currently undecided whether to go to the Philippines in the future.</p>
<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>○Telegram from Daming: To all newspaper offices: I recently read in the newspaper a telegram from Shi Yousan, which included the name of Liu Guitang. After reading it, I was very surprised. Since Guitang's reorganization, he has been deeply favored by the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and he is grateful for their kindness and has always been unswerving in his loyalty. I dare to swear to heaven and earth that he has no other intentions. This time, he was ordered to move to Daming to defend, protect the people, and train his troops. He absolutely obeys the orders of the Northeast. Moreover, Guitang has only one brigade, and his power is weak and his words carry little weight. He is ashamed of his mediocrity, but he is committed to serving the party and the country and will not lag behind others. I am deeply afraid that this is a case of seeing ghosts in the shadows and that the newspaper reports are wrong. I hereby declare, and await your instructions with apprehension. Liu Guitang, Commander of the Newly Organized 6th Brigade of the Army, respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Yantai</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices: I have just replied to Chairman Liu and other gentlemen in a telegram, which reads: "I have read your telegram of today, and I deeply admire your support for unification and your dedication to rescuing the country from the communists. Your words are solemn and your righteousness is just, and the whole country admires you. Our department is loyal to the party and the country, deeply loves peace, and vows to follow the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and follow behind you to jointly punish the rebels and forever secure the foundation of the country. I hereby send this telegram in reply, and I hope you will take note," and so on. I respectfully send this telegram for your information. Liu Zhennian respectfully bows.</p>

<h3>Research on Korean Immigration to the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Part 3) Bin</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War in the 21st year of Guangxu's reign and the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Japan nominally forced us to recognize Korea as an independent country, but in reality, it took its place. From then on, Koreans, suffering from Japanese oppression, immigrated in increasing numbers. The Japanese further instigated animosity between the Chinese and Korean peoples in order to seize the four counties of Yanbian. The "Gando" dispute in the 33rd year of Guangxu's reign exposed Japan's initial ambition to invade the Northeast.</p>
<p>After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan's ambition to invade our Northeast became even more urgent. After many negotiations, in the first year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing dynasty, it signed the Sino-Korean Border Affairs Treaty of the Tumen River and the Five Articles of Negotiation on the Three Eastern Provinces with Japan. In exchange for the reconstruction of the Anfeng Railway and the mining rights of the Fushun and Yantai coal mines, Japan finally recognized the four counties of Yanbian as our territory. The treaty recognized the land north of the Tumen River as a mixed residence area. The people of both China and Korea had to receive the same treatment there. With this convenience, even more Koreans migrated. Since Japan annexed Korea, the Japanese colonized Korean soldiers, and Koreans were forced to cross the Yalu and Tumen rivers to enter the Northeast. At that time, our border areas were being developed and needed people. As a result, the immigration of Koreans became as numerous as crucian carp crossing the river. Villages faced each other, scattered like stars in the sky. Since the founding of the Republic, under Japan's immigration policy, Koreans, backed by their political power and aided by semi-official organizations such as the Oriental Development Company and the South Manchuria Railway Company, increased their immigration to the Northeast year by year. According to Japanese surveys, the state of Korean migration in the corner of Yanbian is approximately as shown in the following table.</p>
<p>Korean Population</p>
<p>Year End of Year Population Annual Increase or Decrease Annual Increase or Decrease Rate</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 1 163,000</p>
<p>Year 5 203,961 (Plus) 40,426 0.199</p>
<p>Year 7 253,961 (Plus) 50,535 0.198</p>
<p>Year 8 279,150 (Plus) 25,189 0.090</p>

<p>Year 14 346,194 (Plus) 16,803 0.049</p>
<p>Year 15 356,016 (Plus) 9,822 0.028</p>
<p>Year 16 368,827 (Plus) 12,811 0.055</p>
<p>Year 17 582,950 (Plus) 14,103 0.038</p>
<p>Year 18 381,561 (Plus) 1,369 0.004</p>
<p>The above-mentioned history of Korean immigration in Yanbian is actually the beginning of Korean intrusion into our Northeast. It also spread from this central area of immigration to various places, creating a major problem in the heart of our Northeast today. This serious border issue has been delayed for decades without a solution. Is it any wonder that the Wanpaoshan incident occurred today?</p>
<p>(4) The Current Status of Korean Immigration to the Northeast</p>
<p>The history of Korean immigration to our Northeast has been roughly described above. After decades of accumulation, the fertile land and abundant resources of our Northeast have become like a second homeland for the "simply dressed" remnants of the Three Hans. The trend of Korean people migrating from various provinces in the heart of the Three Hans is increasing day by day. The speed of the increase in numbers is alarming. We allow others to sleep soundly beside our bed. They even overstep their bounds, turning from guests into hosts. The loss of sovereignty and the endless hidden dangers make us shudder.</p>
<p>To understand the current situation of Koreans in our Northeast, we must first examine where the most Koreans reside and how many there are. Our country has never paid attention to various statistics. To this day, there is still a lack of accurate statistics on the Chinese and foreign populations in various cities. It goes without saying that there is even less information on the Korean immigrants who come and go without a trace in the remote border areas of the Northeast. Although there have been surveys in the Northeast, they are inconsistent and make it difficult to choose. Japanese surveys often contain false records to confuse public opinion and are even more difficult to trust. Helplessly, let us compare the statistics from various sources to get a rough idea.</p>
<p>(1) According to a survey in Changchun at the end of 1929:</p>
<p>Liaoning Province: 455,125 people</p>
<p>Jilin Province: 556,320 people</p>
<p>Heilongjiang Province: 363,240 people</p>
<p>Total: 1,374,685 people (See "The Korean Issue in the Three Eastern Provinces" compiled by the Korean Provisional Government)</p>
<p>(2) According to a survey in Shenyang in early 1930:</p>
<p>Total for the three provinces: 1.3 million (See the same book)</p>
<p>(3) According to a survey by the Korean Compatriot Association of the Three Eastern Provinces in 1925:</p>
<p>Liaoning Province: 500,000 people, 10,000 naturalized</p>
<p>Jilin Province: 700,000 people, 100,000 naturalized</p>
<p>Heilongjiang Province: 100,000 people, 5,000 naturalized</p>
<p>Total: 1.3 million people, 115,000 naturalized</p>
<p>(4) According to a survey by the Eastern Railway Economic Bureau in 1929:</p>
<p>1. Residents in urban areas: 381,63 people</p>
<p>2. Residents in hinterland: 521,929 people</p>
<p>Total: 560,991 people</p>
<p>The above four statistics were all taken between 1929 and 1930. The smallest number is 560,091 people, and the largest number is 1,374,685 people. The difference is very large. Which one is reliable is difficult to determine. According to a report in the Shen Bao on February 2 of this year, "Since the ninth year of the Republic, the Japanese government has driven more than 3.7 million Korean people to immigrate to the Northeast in the name of colonization." This is an even greater difference from the above figures. In short, although none of the above figures can be considered accurate, the number of Korean immigrants in the Northeast today is at least between 1.3 million and 2 million. Such a huge amount of foreign immigration is unprecedented in the world. The significance of this matter for the future of our Northeast is self-evident to those with insight.</p>
<p>As for the distribution of Koreans in the Northeast, according to a survey by the Japanese Consulate, the following table shows:</p>
<p>Region Korean Population</p>
<p>Along the South Manchuria Railway 39,531</p>
<p>Liaoning 135,245</p>
<p>Jilin 54,661</p>
<p>Gando 382,390</p>
<p>Heilongjiang 7,449</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>He Chengjun's Remarks</h3>
<p>▲ Suppression of Communist Troops in Jiangxi Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>▲ Shi Yousan's Changes Inevitably Doomed to Failure</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, Director of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, went to Gan this month on the 19th to visit Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek to seek instructions on matters such as the suppression of bandits and the administration of affairs. He stayed in Nanchang for two days. Commander-in-Chief Chiang gave detailed instructions on the secret matters of suppressing bandits on the borders of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and the borders of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, as well as dealing with the situation in the North. Because of the importance of defense, it was inconvenient for him to stay for long. He took a special train from Nanchang to Xun on the morning of the 22nd, and then took the Taikoo Company's Poyang steamer westward. After receiving the telegram, the headquarters calculated that he would arrive in Hankou on the afternoon of the 23rd and notified the generals to gather at the riverbank to meet him. Those present included Xu Yuanquan, Director of Bandit Suppression and Rural Pacification in the Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan border areas; Fan Shisheng, Commander of the 51st Division; Zhu Chuanjing, Chief of Staff of the Provisional Headquarters; Ye Peng, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command; and brigade commanders Pan Shanzhai, Rong Jingfang, and Li Dingwu. At about 3:00 PM, the Poyang steamer arrived at the port. He got off the boat and went straight to the headquarters to take up his duties and meet with important people. He did not return to his private residence to rest until late in the evening. Xia Douyin, Commander of the Garrison, and Qian Dajun, Commander of the Fortress, who went with him, will arrive in Hankou a few days later because they are taking a detour to Mount Lu. After He returned to the headquarters, the reporter immediately visited him. According to him, the purpose of his trip to Gan was to report to Commander-in-Chief Chiang on the progress of bandit suppression and to seek instructions. The results were very satisfactory. The military situation in Gan Province is very smooth. Guangchang and Ningdu have been recovered one after another. The troops are taking advantage of the victory to pursue the bandits with great momentum. They are currently surrounding Donggu and will be able to capture it in a matter of days. After Donggu is recovered, the Red bandits will be wiped out in the near future. Commander-in-Chief Chiang will take advantage of the Red bandits' crushing defeat to visit Hankou this month. As for Shi Yousan's changes, rumors that he has been in contact with Commander Zhang's troops are not yet true. Shi's troops are not numerous, and abandoning obedience and following rebellion will inevitably lead to failure. Moreover, Han Fuqu, Sun Dianying, and the Jin-Sui generals are all sincerely supporting the Central Government and have sent telegrams denouncing Shi's absurdity. Commander Zhang is stationed in Beiping with full authority to handle the matter, which can be resolved smoothly. It is also heard that He has formed a committee to revise the business tax regulations in Hubei Province because the business tax has not improved after half a year of implementation. The committee has been officially established on the 24th. He will host a banquet for the chambers of commerce and industry associations at Yijiangchun on the same day to explain everything.

<p>▲ Yang and Ma's Representatives Arrive in Gan One After Another</p>
<p>▲ Yunnan Provincial Committee's Sichuan Representative Also Arrives</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After Chairman Chiang returned to Nanchang from the front line, many important figures came to Gan to pay their respects. He Chengjun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government and Director of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, arrived in Gan on the 20th with Qian Dajun and Xia Douyin, and stayed at the Jiangxi Grand Hotel. Immediately after unloading their luggage, they went to the headquarters to visit Chiang and report on the military and political affairs of Hubei Province, the suppression of bandits in the two lakes, and the joint suppression in various places on the borders of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan, and to seek instructions. Chiang gave instructions on each matter. After He and the others took their leave, they went to the provincial government to meet Chairman Lu and discuss plans for suppressing bandits in Yangxin, Tongshan, Xiushui, Tonggu, and Pingliu, as well as the plans of Kong Hechong and Li Shixing. On the afternoon of the 21st, Lu hosted a banquet for He, Qian, and Xia at his private residence to discuss the issue of bandit suppression once again. This morning (22nd), He and the others went to the headquarters to bid farewell to Chiang, and then took a car from the headquarters to the crossing outside Zhang, and then transferred to the Niuhang Railway Station to take a train to Jiujiang, where they took a ship back to Hankou. On the same day, Hu Yimin, representative of Yang Hucheng, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the 17th Route Army, Tong Yaohua, representative of Ma Hongkui, Commander-in-Chief of the 15th Route Army, and Ma Wende, Deputy Commander of the 7th Army, arrived in the province by express train from Xun. After reporting to the headquarters, Chairman Chiang met with them separately and inquired about everything. Hu, Tong, and the others gave detailed reports on the military and political affairs of Shaanxi and the situation of the 15th Route Army in Lu, and conveyed everything on their behalf. Yesterday (21st), Sun Du and Zhang Weihan, members of the Yunnan Provincial Government, also arrived in Gan via the capital to report to Commander-in-Chief Chiang on the military and political situation in Yunnan Province and to seek instructions. Liu Xiang's representative arrived in the province a few days ago and reported on Sichuan's recent facilities and the situation of the various troops on behalf of Liu. He will return to Sichuan soon.

<h3>He Jian Inspects Baoqing</h3>
<p>▲ Liu Yinggu Acts as Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The fortification work in Baoqing Fortress has long been completed. Brigade Commander Liang Ji, stationed in Baoqing, and people from all walks of life in Baoqing have repeatedly sent telegrams to welcome Commander-in-Chief He to inspect Baoqing, but He has not been able to make the trip due to busy official duties. Now that He has some free time due to his official duties,</p>
<p>he has specifically decided to depart at 6:00 AM this month (21st) to inspect Baoqing, and will also go to Xiangtan and Xiangxiang to gather teams for training talks. Those accompanying him include Division Commander Peng Weiren, Secretary-General Ling Zhang, Section Chief Luo Zhen, Director Li Renmei, Staff Officer Tian Qiyou, Adjutant Zhou Dayi, and a guard team of more than 100 soldiers, traveling in seven cars. The railway bureau has already telegraphed the stations in Tan and Xiang to prepare everything. All duties of the Commander-in-Chief will be performed by Chief of Staff Liu Yinggu. The duties of the Rural Pacification Headquarters will be performed by Chief of Staff Chen Xuwan.

<h3>Anti-Japanese Movement in Various Circles in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>▲ Party, Government, Business, and Labor Circles Take Unified Action</p>
<p>▲ Economic Severance with Japan, Inspection of Enemy Goods</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since the Wanpaoshan incident occurred, people from all walks of life in Hunan Province have been extremely indignant. The recent anti-Japanese movement is described in detail as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Party and Government: The Provincial Party Affairs Steering Committee and the Provincial Government have successively issued circular telegrams, requesting all circles in the country to unanimously advocate serious negotiations on the Wanpaoshan case, promote domestic goods, and assist overseas Chinese. Japanese Consul-General to Hunan, Tani Renji, met with He Jian a few days ago to discuss official business. He spoke to the Japanese Consul about the indignation of Chinese people in various places, requesting that he inform the Japanese government to be aware of the situation and provide a satisfactory resolution to avoid the escalation of the turmoil. The Provincial Party Headquarters also telegraphed various counties and cities yesterday to hold mass rallies to assist the Wanpaoshan case and expand anti-Japanese propaganda.</p>
<p>▲ Business Circles: The business community is even more agitated about this case. The Changsha City Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the banks in Shanghai and Hankou to stop handling Japanese goods. Meanwhile, the Provincial Federation of Commerce has issued a circular telegram, advocating that the government be urged to strictly instruct the diplomatic authorities to promptly lodge a serious protest and implement revolutionary diplomacy. It also stated that the Federation is determined to lead the businessmen of the province to implement economic severance and permanently boycott enemy goods as a support for the government. At a minimum, the Japanese side must apologize, compensate, and punish the murderers. At the same time, all unequal treaties between China and Japan must be abolished, and all outstanding cases from the past must be thoroughly resolved. If there is no satisfactory outcome, resolute measures should be taken, and the effort will not cease until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>▲ Labor Circles: The Changsha City Trade Unions held an emergency meeting at the City Party Headquarters yesterday, the 21st, with representatives from various factories, totaling more than 2,000 people. They unanimously resolved to send a circular telegram to the country, striving for negotiations on the Wanpaoshan case, implementing economic severance with Japan, and permanently serving as a support for the government. They also requested the Central Government to seriously negotiate and vowed not to stop until the murderers were severely punished, losses were compensated, and the safety of overseas Chinese was permanently guaranteed.</p>
<p>▲ People's Congress: The Hunan people held a mass rally to assist the Wanpaoshan incident at the Provincial Education Association at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. All sectors of the Party, government, military, business, and academia participated. Workers from all factories stopped work for one day, assembled in teams to attend the meeting, and rickshaws stopped running for one day. All evening newspapers suspended publication for one day to express their indignation. At that time, 50,000 to 60,000 people attended the meeting, presided over by Tan Changkai, who explained the details of the tragic case and the attitude that the Chinese people should take. Finally, it was resolved to announce the crimes of the Japanese in a circular telegram, to request the Central Government to seriously negotiate, to request the people of the whole country to rise up together to resist foreign aggression, and to organize the "Hunan People's Support Association for Anti-Japanese Diplomacy." Fang Xiaochuan, Chen Jieshi, Xu Shu, Zhou Naixia, Liang Guodong, Wei Zhenbang, Tang Gan, Yu Fu, Tang Qiufan, Wang Shouren, Zhang Tiexiang, Chen Su, Liu Yunxiu, Feng He'an, Shi Chuncai, Liu Zhenpeng, Peng Jiaren, and Liu Wonan were elected as members, and the association was established on the same day to implement the inspection of enemy goods and economic severance with Japan, until 12:00 PM, when slogans were shouted and the meeting was adjourned. (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Continued News on Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Wuhan</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: All sectors of society in Hankou held an anti-Japanese and overseas Chinese protection conference on the 18th to assist overseas Chinese in resisting Japanese violence, telegraphed the Central Government to conduct serious negotiations, and resolved to organize an anti-Japanese association to implement economic severance with the Japanese. Responsible persons were designated to start preparations, and the preparatory committee appointed Wang Jinxia, Lu Shoupeng, Gao Bochang, and others to draft the outline of the organization to be formally established within a week. As for the boycott of Japanese goods, preparations are also underway. The City Chamber of Commerce has notified all industry associations to ban Japanese goods and donate money to help distressed overseas Chinese. The announcement is recorded as follows: "It has been found that in the Wanpaoshan village in Changchun County, Jilin Province, Korean farmers forcibly reclaimed paddy fields. The Japanese took the opportunity to implement a new attempt at their Manchuria-Mongolia policy. On the one hand, they occupied Wanpaoshan by force to protect Korean farmers and continue their illegal work. On the other hand, they incited Korean people to riot and massacre overseas Chinese. Alas, our overseas Chinese compatriots, countless have died, and thousands are fleeing back to the country every day. The situation is extremely embarrassing, with refugees everywhere. External disasters are compounding each other, and there is no basis for return. This is truly a cry to heaven that cannot be stopped. All colleagues in our industries, aware of this tragedy, must have the same compassion to provide relief. We hope that you will show great compassion and donate as much as possible to help the disaster-stricken overseas Chinese. Please also report the amount of funds raised at any time for statistical distribution. This case is of great importance. In addition to telegraphing to vow to support the government to the death, the association should immediately automatically sever economic ties with Japan. From now on, all businesses are strictly prohibited from ordering Japanese goods. We vow to persevere in our determination and avoid being ridiculed for half-heartedness. We hope that all our colleagues will be loyal and enthusiastic, and work together to save the situation. Then we will be very fortunate." (23rd)</p>

<h3>More Refugees Arrive in Andong</h3>
<p>▲ Returning Because Homes Were Destroyed and Fortunes Were Lost, Making Survival Impossible</p>
<p>▲ More Than Six Hundred People Have Arrived in the Last Three Days</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: The Andong General Chamber of Commerce received an urgent telegram from the Pyongyang Chinese Chamber of Commerce on the morning of the 18th, stating that Chinese people who had gone out to take refuge were returning one after another, and Chinese businesses in the city had all resumed operations and were trading as usual. However, there were about six or seven hundred unemployed Chinese people who had their homes burned down, their property completely lost, and were completely unemployed. They could not stay in Pyongyang, so they were sent back to the country to find another life to avoid starving to death in a foreign land. When these unemployed Chinese people enter the country, please take them in properly and provide them with some funds so that they do not become displaced. After receiving the telegram, the General Chamber of Commerce immediately notified the staff of the refugee reception center to prepare everything. That evening, the first batch of 320 unemployed Chinese people were sent from Pyongyang and sent to the Dangui Stage in the city for proper accommodation. In the past two days, the 19th and 20th, more than 200 people have arrived. According to the investigation by the staff of the refugee reception center, the number of people who have come to An from the Korean interior in recent days is as follows: 95 people on the 16th, 42 people on the 17th, 250 people on the 18th, and 64 people passed through Andong on the 19th and went directly to Changchun. Furthermore, since the 7th of this month, as of the most recent date, the total number of overseas Chinese from the Korean interior received by the reception centers in the city is 3,250, including 274 from Xuanchuan, 92 from Pyongyang, 44 from Dingzhou, 120 from Xin'anzhou.</p>

The cost of travel to North Korea is limited to Sinuiju, and those who go to the Northeast and North Manchuria to make a living will be given all the travel expenses regardless of the distance. The institute will purchase the tickets on its behalf, issue them temporarily at the station, and give another two yuan of silver before sending them to the train. Most of the incoming refugees have been dispersed, but the refugees from Pyongyang who have recently arrived are still being taken care of. (July 20th)</p>
<h3>The Reality of Flooding in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>▲ The Provincial Government Asks the Central Government and Other Provinces for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Hubei Province is located on the Yangtze and Han rivers and has long been known as a land of lakes. Since the beginning of summer, excessive rainfall and dyke breaches have caused an unprecedented disaster. Continuous rain has not stopped for days, and the river water has risen sharply, almost level with the banks. Not only have fields and houses been submerged in the breaches, but Wuhan, which has always been known as a high-lying area, has also been obstructed due to waterlogging in the inner streets. The Zhanggong Dyke, which is the protection of Hankou, is often in danger of collapsing. People are panicked and cannot live in peace. The Hubei Provincial Government, aware that a major disaster has occurred and fearing that the dyke will collapse again and endanger Wuhan, has ordered the Water Conservancy Bureau to send personnel to investigate and take practical precautions, and the Garrison Department has sent teams to patrol to prevent reactionary bandits from taking the opportunity to sabotage. On the 23rd, it was submitted to the provincial government meeting for discussion. For the dykes along the Yangtze River in Wuhan, the Water Conservancy Bureau was ordered to take charge, and the Construction Department, the Water Police Bureau, the Hankou Municipal Government, and the Hankou Public Security Bureau were ordered to assist to ensure thoroughness. As for the most dangerous dykes in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, such as the Sandi Temple and Chewan dykes, and the Qianjiang and Jingshan dykes in the upper reaches of the Xiang River, the Water Conservancy Bureau has also sent personnel to survey and repair them at any time. If the rain stops within a few days, there may be no danger. In addition to the directors of the dyke works bureaus in the counties where the dykes have collapsed, who will be watched and punished separately, all disaster victims will first be provided with emergency relief using the rice stored in the Pingdiao. At the same time, the telegram requested the Central Relief Committee to allocate funds for disaster relief, saying, "Since the beginning of summer in Hubei Province, it has been raining for ten days, mountain floods have broken out, and the Yangtze and Han rivers have risen simultaneously, causing dyke breaches and submerging fields and houses. Even if the land is called high-lying and the fields belong to tombs, the upstream pours down, and the downstream tail is not open, which causes the drowning of wheat and the destruction of homes. The cries of sorrow of the living, and the dead buried in the bellies of fish. The tragedy of the disaster, and the magnitude of the disaster area, are rarely seen in recent times. In addition, years of banditry have resulted in a lack of hoarding of wealth, a lack of porridge for living, and no clean land to escape to. Hunger makes it difficult to leave the house, and life is imminent. Moreover, at a time of tension in the suppression of the Red Army, there is even more concern about the violence of a bad year. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness, and the crisis should be strictly prevented. In addition to sending personnel to various disaster areas to conduct detailed surveys, properly appease, and find ways to dredge and eliminate waterlogging, hoping to replant late rice, we are deeply afraid that the delay will be too long and the relief will be inadequate. We are specifically appealing to your association to consider the severity of the disaster in Hubei, to promptly allocate a large sum of money to purchase food and provide emergency relief in order to protect the lives of the people and spread kindness." At the same time, telegrams were sent to the provincial and municipal governments and local chambers of commerce, stating that we hope you will be compassionate and help your neighbors in need. We respectfully ask on behalf of all the disaster victims in Hubei. (July 23rd)</p>

<h3>Continuous Torrential Rains Threaten Various Counties Along the Su-Yun Canal</h3>
<p>▲ All Dams Returning to the Yangtze River Opened One After Another</p>
<p>▲ Opening the Dams Returning to the Sea Will Create a Waterlogged Country</p>
<p>▲ Public Opinion Divided into Factions For and Against Dam Opening</p>
<p>The upper reaches of the Grand Canal are fed by the Huai River. This summer, continuous rain has prevented the Huai River from discharging, causing the water level in the Grand Canal to rise continuously. The magnitude of the river's flow is unprecedented in decades. According to reports from the Water Conservancy Bureau yesterday, except for Gaoyou's Yu Matou, where the water level remains at 1.52 zhang, the water level has generally begun to drop due to the recent clear weather. Bengbu has dropped 5 centimeters but remains at 19.80 meters.  Wan has dropped 2.3 centimeters but remains at 18.703 meters. Gouzha has risen 3 cun and remains at 1.9 zhang. These were affected by the Huai River surge of the past few days. In recent days, torrential rains have continued day and night, with over 2 chi of rainfall in the past two days and nights. Several sections of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway have been flooded and impassable. In Zhenjiang, the river water has overflowed onto the riverbanks, turning the riverside roads into a watery land. Therefore, an increase in the water level of the Grand Canal is inevitable. Given this situation, it will be difficult to avoid opening the dams returning to the sea. However, considering the history of flood prevention along the Grand Canal, no matter what the water level, it is absolutely necessary to wait until a certain deadline after the autumn harvest to open the Cheluo, Xin Nanguan, and Sanba dams appropriately. As for the Zhongba dam, it has been abandoned, and the Zhaoguan dam has been closed for a long time due to its impact on the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of square miles. If the continuous rains do not stop, the downstream will also increase without decreasing. To protect the safety of the counties along the Grand Canal, it may be necessary to take action. It is reported that the provincial government has received urgent reports from various places these days. In addition to Director Sun personally departing to inspect the river, Hou Zhenping and Wang Jingtao were also dispatched yesterday to reside in Gaoyou and work on flood prevention. The farmers east and west of the river have different interests and are in conflict with each other. The people downstream are deeply afraid of the dam opening and are now gathered on the river embankment to try to prevent it. However, it is not yet known how the authorities will handle it.</p>
<h3>Severe Flooding in Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ High and Low Fields Are All Submerged</p>
<p>▲ Grain Prices Are Gradually Increasing</p>
<p>Wuxi experienced heavy rain at the beginning of the month, causing river water to surge. The lowest fields were immediately submerged. On the 11th, there was a severe thunderstorm, and the water volume was higher than the first time. However, the lower fields could still be salvaged. Unexpectedly, starting on the 22nd, there was another continuous heavy rain, and the river water continued to rise by more than a chi. In the seventh district, Yangpo Dike and Huilong Dike, a total of more than 2,500 mu of fields, were mostly submerged. In the fifteenth district, the east and west Huajia Dikes, the upper, middle, and lower Sanyu, the north and south Xia Dikes, Tuotang Dike, the east and west Jiu Dikes, Liyang'an Dike, Dicheng Dike, Tianbao Gate Dike, and Loutan Dike were all submerged. Many small dikes collapsed. In the sixteenth district, Linzhuang Dike, etc., and in the fifth district, Hengpai Dike, were all submerged. Several dikes also collapsed. The low-lying fields along the lake have all been given up. In the lowest places, the water level is already level with the houses. Livestock have been washed away and lost. Transportation between the city and the countryside is completely cut off. The dikes in the four rural areas are in danger day and night. Farmers are working around the clock to reinforce the dikes. Although water pumps and wooden waterwheels are used to drain the water, there is no effect. Moreover, the dikes are only a few cun above the water surface, and the installation of axles is ineffective. If they want to build higher, there is no soil to be found. They can only let them collapse. As for the Furong Dike, which spans the three counties of Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Wujin, and the Yangjia Dike in the fifteenth and sixteenth districts, the inner dike is submerged in water like an upturned wok, and the outer dike is also in imminent danger. They are currently being defended. The city is a major grain distribution area, and all grain warehouses are located in the Beitang area. In recent days, the water has reached the shore and flooded the factory buildings. The warehouse owners are rushing to buy large quantities of pine planks to pile up the grain to prevent damage from water collapse. As a result, the price of pine planks has increased. Inch-thick planks are sold for 5.2 yuan per zhang. The rice market has also soared, from 10.6 yuan to 12 yuan. The situation in the flour market has also increased accordingly. The poor are constantly complaining. This year's wheat harvest was poor, and the silkworm industry failed. Farmers have little savings. Now, they have suffered from this flood. Since yesterday, farmers in various districts have reported famine and requested emergency relief. However, the disaster area is very large, and it may not be easy to investigate for the time being.</p>
<h3>Quick Dispatch from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ The Liangzhe Anti-Smuggling Team, originally consisting of ten detachments, was renamed the Tax Police Team and placed under the management of the Inspection Office. The ten detachments were then reorganized into five detachments. Compared with the original establishment, the number of officers and soldiers was reduced by five-tenths. The first, second, third, and fourth detachments were reorganized first. The sixth and seventh detachments are currently being merged. Starting in August, monthly savings of more than 15,000 yuan can be achieved, and annual savings of more than 170,000 yuan can be achieved.</p>
<p>▲ Changxing County has abundant coal resources. A new coalfield, the Wushan Coalfield in Xiajian Village in the south of the county, has been discovered, with a large area. The Zhejiang Provincial Mineral Resources Survey Institute has sent surveyor Li Yixing to investigate and verify it for processing.</p>
<p>▲ The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Jiaxing section has 14 station police stations, with a total of about 150 police officers. The Ministry of Railways has sent two specialists, Ding and Rong, to Hangzhou at approximately 9:00 AM today (the 25th) to inspect and train them to be diligent and responsible.</p>
<p>▲ The Tang dike above the Eight Forts in Hai Ning County, with a length of more than one li, has been under construction since April but has not yet been completed. The autumn tide is approaching, and the danger is concerning. Yesterday, the Dike Works Bureau was ordered to intensify the construction day and night, complete it by a limited date, and order personnel to inspect each dike section by section to determine whether it is consolidated and report it for verification. (25th)</p>
<p>Local Communication</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>A Strange Fire Occurs at Zhang Renji Confectionery. Zhang Renji Confectionery, Biscuit, and Foreign Wine Store, No. 58 Beishi Street, was opened by Zhang Junchang, a local resident, who also sold soda and other items. It has been in business for five years and the business has been fairly good. Unexpectedly, at approximately 10:00 AM on the 22nd, a fire suddenly broke out in the firewood room of the store for unknown reasons. Fortunately, it was discovered and extinguished with water. At that time, perhaps because there were still embers in the firewood pile, no attention was paid to it. Unexpectedly, at approximately 1:00 PM, smoke suddenly filled the area under the soda box under the stairs. It was quickly discovered by the staff and extinguished. Before long, the mosquito net upstairs suddenly caught fire. The people in the shop below were unaware of it. Soon, the flames burst out through the window, which was spotted by a rickshaw driver on the side of the road, who shouted, "Fire!" The neighbors were shocked and immediately rang the alarm bells everywhere. In no time, all the fire engines arrived and extinguished the fire. The dragon societies returned to their respective locations. Unexpectedly, the walls soon caught fire again, and then the bedding caught fire. No one could figure it out. The store owner and staff were busy fighting the fire. They closed the store doors and stopped doing business. The post office branch next door, recently established, was afraid of being affected by the fire that kept flaring up, so it moved all the important documents and mail to another location. The store owner was almost mentally deranged because he couldn't figure out the cause of the fire. He asked passersby, who said it was caused by fox spirits. Zhang went to various places to burn incense and make vows and invited Taoist priests to perform rituals at home. Unexpectedly, while the bells and drums were ringing and the Taoist priests were chanting, the calendar hanging on the wall suddenly caught fire. It is estimated that there were as many as eleven fires in half a day, which is truly unheard of. Fortunately, none of them spread. However, the neighboring residents were afraid that another disaster would occur at night, so they warned each other not to sleep.</p>
<p>The Old Case of Former County Magistrate Zhuang Yan's Embezzlement Is Brought Up Again. Zhuang Yeguang, the current director of the Finance Bureau of this county, is the son of Zhuang Yan, who served as the county magistrate of this county twice and also served as the county magistrate of Nantong. Last year, he was sentenced to three months in prison in Suzhou for visiting a prisoner, Lu Yuren, in Nantong and carrying and sending opium. When Zhuang was the county magistrate in this county, he was suspected of embezzling 4,000 yuan of public funds. It has now been discovered by citizen Chen Yingchun. It is recorded on the transfer of authority that Sun Chuanfang took away 4,000 yuan in military funds. He presented it vaguely for verification and cancellation. Now that his son Yeguang has come to Changshu as the head of finance, Chen once wrote to Yeguang, asking him to pay it on behalf of his father, with a deadline of ten days to reply. However, Zhuang did not reply. Now Chen has evidence that the former county magistrate Zhuang embezzled public funds and has drafted a complaint to the Supervisory Yuan, the Finance Department, and the chief prosecutor of the High Court, listing the evidence and formally accusing him, in the hope that the truth will come out. Chen Yingchun, courtesy name Housheng, was also a county government official when Zhuang was the county magistrate.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Change of Finance Bureau Chief. Shen Ruji, the chief of the Finance Bureau of Wuxi County, resigned due to financial exhaustion and difficulty in coping. The Director of Finance Department approved the resignation and transferred Gong Li, the chief of the Finance Bureau of Shanghai County, to Wuxi to take over. Chief Wang has arrived in Wuxi from Shanghai yesterday and decided to hand over today (26th). It is also heard that Chief Wang has decided to transfer Zhang Pengfei, the chief of the First Section. He arrived in Wuxi yesterday. Lu Dingxin, the chief of the Second Section, is still in Shanghai to handle the handover. The other staff members have also changed slightly.</p>
<p>Organizing the All-Circles Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee. All circles of agriculture, industry, commerce, and education in Wuxi gathered at the county party headquarters yesterday to discuss the issues of Korean people, instigated by the Japanese, massacring overseas Chinese in Korea and the countermeasures against Japan.

<p>Township Chiefs in the Seventeenth District Resign En Masse. Hua Sigu, the district chief of the seventeenth district (Fuan Township), is a graduate of the second session of the Jiangsu Province District Chief Training Institute. He initially served in the tenth district, where someone accused him of embezzlement, etc. Although he is now in his current position, the public sentiment is still mostly dissatisfied. A few days ago, all 25 township chiefs in the district submitted a petition to the county government, stating that Hua was selfish and derelict in his duties and that they were ashamed to work with him. They jointly requested to resign en masse. Yesterday, the county government instructed the township chiefs to order several representatives to be recommended to the case on the 29th to confront the district chief and then re-verify it.</p>
<p>Strange News of a Rural Woman Giving Birth to a Snake. Wang, the wife of Zhou Huanzhang, a villager in Linzhuang Village, near Linzhuang Bridge, Qingcheng Township, the fifteenth district of the county, became pregnant two years ago and has not yet given birth. Her abdomen is large and bulging, like a five-stone melon. The Huanzhang couple were very surprised. The day before yesterday, Wang felt a faint pain in her abdomen. Her husband knew that she was about to give birth and immediately hired a midwife to deliver the baby. After a while, Wang's abdominal pain increased, and suddenly she gave birth to a section of a snake's head, about five or six cun long, with a ferocious and terrifying appearance. However, the lower half of the snake did not come out for a long time. When the midwife saw this, she planned to put her hand in and take the snake out. Unexpectedly, the snake suddenly retracted completely. At that time, the news spread throughout the neighborhood, and those who went to watch filled the doorway, and everyone's faces changed. However, the pregnant woman Wang was still safe and sound. Her husband, Huanzhang, took his wife by boat to the city yesterday and admitted her to Puren Hospital. The hospital doctor performed surgery to remove the snake. Upon inspection, the snake was dead. Let it be noted for the research of physiologists.</p>
<p>A Quarrel Between Husband and Wife Turns Into a Tragedy. Chen Xuegan, the son of Chen Wenhao, a resident of No. 12 Taiding Bridge in the city, is 28 years old. He used to work at the Minxin Printing Company in Hongkou, Shanghai. Recently, Chen Xuegan returned to Wuxi because he was suffering from athlete's foot. The other night, Chen planned to spend time with his wife, Cheng. Cheng did not agree, which led to an argument. Chen Xuegan, in a moment of anger, took a sharp knife and stabbed Cheng's throat, causing her to bleed profusely and fall to the ground unconscious. Xuegan, knowing that he had caused a disaster, immediately abandoned the knife and fled. Later, someone reported it to the police, who immediately took the injured person to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau and transferred her to the Labor Hospital for treatment. At the same time, Chen Wenhao, Xuegan's father, was summoned to the bureau for questioning and ordered to post bail and wait for his son Xuegan to be arrested before further investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Liyang Bribery Case Raises Questions of Jurisdiction. In the case of former Liyang County Magistrate Li Jinfang reporting that former Finance Bureau Chief Pan Keping colluded with the county chamber of commerce members to commit bribery, the provincial government transferred the case file to the court for investigation and resolution. It is now heard that Li Jinfang has filed a further lawsuit against Pan Keping for bribery with the Zhenjiang Local Court. The prosecutor's office believed that Pan had worked at the National Revolutionary Army's 18th Division's Beijing Office and presented a letter of appointment from that office, causing doubts about jurisdiction. Yesterday, they submitted a request to the Jiangsu Higher Court Prosecutor's Office for verification and instructions and notified Li Jinfang. Continuous Heavy Rains Cause Tragedy. Since the heavy rain on the 2nd of this month, the Zhenjiang area has experienced many days of continuous rain, which has only slightly cleared up. Unexpectedly, in the past two days, there has been heavy rain again, especially at night. All the back alleys of the streets are flooded with water to the ankles, forming a vast expanse of water, almost like a swamp. The collapse of walls and houses is even more common. Yesterday morning, a portion of the Jingji Linghou Mountain collapsed due to the daily heavy rain erosion, causing the residents at the foot of the mountain, along with their houses, to be buried in the soil. After many people dug and picked, it was heard that two people were suffocated to death and two were injured, who were then taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Mountain Floods Erupt, Steamships and Automobiles Completely Suspended. In the Huzhou area, there has been continuous heavy rain for the past half month, resulting in mountain floods and surging river waters. The lowest embankment is less than a chi from the river water. Therefore, all shipping companies are afraid of the impact on the embankment and the damage to farmland. On the 22nd, all steamships on the Shanghai-Huzhou, Hangzhou-Huzhou, Suzhou-Huzhou, and Southwest Township routes were completely suspended. However, the Shanghai-Huzhou route was able to operate as usual because it runs on Tai Lake. Also, the automobile road on the Hangzhou-Huzhou section was washed away in several places by mountain floods, and vehicles could not travel. All were temporarily suspended, resulting in the complete disruption of transportation in the Huzhou area. It is heard that yesterday, the 22nd, the Zhaoshang Lixing ships from Shanghai to Huzhou were stopped by the farmers in Pingwang this morning and were unable to move forward. The ships were temporarily docked in Pingwang and immediately telegraphed the two bureaus in this city. It is heard that the two shipping companies, after receiving the news, planned to hire many ferries tomorrow to go to the area to pick up and transport goods to Huzhou.</p>
<p>Director Chen of the Public Security Bureau Transferred to Jiashan. Chen Hongji, the director of the Public Security Bureau of Wuxing County in this city, has been in office for almost a year. Recently, someone falsely used the name of gentleman Li Huibo, etc., and accused him to the provincial government. Although Li Guangyu, the county magistrate of Wuxing County, investigated the truth and Li Huibo, etc., denied the accusations, Director Chen became passive because of this and repeatedly submitted his resignation to the Civil Affairs Department. The Civil Affairs Department has now approved Chen's transfer to be the director of the Public Security Bureau of Jiashan County.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Main Culprit in the Xu Zhuoran Assassination Case Will Be Escorted to Hangzhou. After the Xu Zhuoran assassination case in Fujian was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Hangzhou County Local Court last year, it was tried many times. On June 5th, it was announced that Chen Delin, Chen Yanxiang, Ye Caizhen, etc., were all innocent, and Lin Luo was sentenced to four years in prison. The prosecutor who investigated the case was dissatisfied and filed a public prosecution with the High Court, which was scheduled to open on August 11th. Yesterday, the High Court received a telegram from Mrs. Xu from Xiamen, which stated that the troops stationed in Tong'an, together with the county government, had arrested the bandit Lin Min, who was the murderer who assassinated Xu Zhuoran in this case, the person who was said to have died in the judgment of the Hangzhou County Local Court. In addition to telegramming the National Government, she requested that personnel be quickly dispatched to escort him to Hangzhou for trial so that justice could be served as soon as possible. It is heard that the High Court, after receiving the telegram, planned to send personnel to meet him and escort him to Hangzhou for trial on the opening date.</p>
<p>The Qingxiang Bureau Arrests a Large Number of Kidnappers. The Qingxiang Bureau of Hangzhou County recently learned that a large number of kidnappers were hiding near Pingyao, kidnapping people for ransom.

It also seized a machete and many other stolen goods and sent them to the Hangzhou Local Court for detention and trial.</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department Strictly Handles the Drug Case on Qingnian Road. The Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang, together with the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital, recently cracked a case of trafficking in a large number of drugs at No. 22 Qingnian Road, the Hangzhou Branch of the Huachang Paint Factory. All the drugs were ordered by the Public Security Bureau to be kept in custody. Later, several places were cracked in Tongxiang, Huangyan, Linhai, etc., and they were also tested by the Provincial Health Testing Institute, which confirmed that they were the same opium substitutes. This time, the Qingnian Road case is a branch office. The correspondence and distribution numbers show that it sells about a thousand yuan per month, divided into six grades: You, Te, Tian, Di, Ren, and Dan. The Civil Affairs Department is paying close attention to this case, and it is being transferred to the court or handled in another case. It is being submitted to the provincial government for approval and disposal.</p>

As a result, the thieves, Cao Songshou, etc., eight people, were each sentenced to one year and six months in prison.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce Asks for Instructions on How to Set Up Branch Offices. The Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, because the townships far from the city are requesting the establishment of branch offices to facilitate commercial affairs, telegraphed the Ministry of Industry on the 23rd, stating that Article 8 of the Chamber of Commerce Law clearly stipulates that the affairs of establishing branch offices shall be carried out by the employees of the chamber of commerce who reside or operate in the area of the branch office. Now, all the employees of this association are engaged in commerce in the city, and their residences are not in the area where the branch office is requested to be established. How should it be handled? It is reasonable to telegraph for verification and instructions.</p>
<p>Deadline for Ending Cases Reported by Villages and Li. The Shaoxing County Government, because the villages and li have not yet completed all the procedures for handling land reporting cases, because the method of surveying and measuring by year has been issued by the province, the cases reported cannot be concluded without sending police to supervise.

<p>Xu Shiying, a respected figure from Anhui residing in Shanghai, hosted a banquet at Yipinxiang Restaurant for fellow Anhui provincials to discuss fundraising for the Anhui Workers' Children's School, which has been established for half a year but lacks funding and faces an uncertain future. During the banquet, Mr. Xu first reported on the school's purpose, followed by representatives such as Hong Junjiu, who reported on the school's establishment process. Then, Principal Pan Shanzhai delivered a speech, expressing his willingness to follow in the footsteps of his fellow elders to maintain the school's development and pledging 300 yuan. Subsequently, Guan Yunong, Hu Xiangjun, Wu Zhiping, and others pledged amounts ranging from 100 to 200 yuan. Mr. Xu then delivered a speech thanking his fellow provincials for their enthusiastic support, and stated that donations should be directly handed over to Mr. Hong Zhenjiu, the fund custodian of the school board. For those fellow provincials who did not attend, Mr. Xu also sent out letters soliciting donations. The letter respectfully stated that the Anhui Workers' Children's School in Shanghai was founded by fellow provincials residing in Shanghai, and has been open for half a year with commendable results. However, the school is in its early stages and lacks funding, which has caused difficulties in its operations. Furthermore, the current semester is about to end, and the next semester involves significant expansion, various equipment, and an urgent need for funds. Xu Shiying, as a fellow provincial, hosted a banquet at Yipinxiang Restaurant to invite fellow elders to discuss fundraising methods. However, due to limited effort, some invitation letters were inevitably missed, which is regrettable. Fortunately, all those who attended that day valued the children of workers, generously donated, and are deeply appreciated. It is believed that this matter is significant and relies on collective efforts. Now, Hong Junjiu, the school board's custodian, has sent someone forward, hoping for understanding and generous donations. This is not only fortunate for Xu Shiying and others. Respectfully wishing you well, Xu Shiying. It is now heard that more than half of the over 1,000 yuan pledged at the time has been received, so the equipment costs and the outstanding carpenter's fees and teacher salaries that Mr. Hong had advanced can all be paid in full. For those who did not attend, such as Mr. Sun Jingxi, have already voluntarily pledged 100 yuan, and said that if the fund reaches 10,000 yuan, the bank will be asked to provide voluntary assistance and earn 1,000 yuan in interest each year. Mr. Hong has discussed this with Mr. Xu. The decision on whether to deposit the received donations in Zhongfu Bank or Minxin Bank will be made after consulting with Mr. Sun Jingxi and Mr. Chen Zhengyou.</p>

<h3>Chinese Basketball Shows Its True Colors, Sweeping Shanghai Business University in Shanghai</h3>
<p>丨Forty-three to Thirteen丨</p>
<p>Shanghai Basketball Emerges as a Rising Force</p>
<p>Business University Suffers Five Losses and Two Wins in Seven Games</p>
<p>Last night, the Shanghai High School Affiliated to the University of Shanghai basketball team defeated the Japanese Tokyo University of Commerce team with a score of 43 to 13 in the China Basketball Hall. Shanghai High School dominated for a time, invincible, and the spectators sighed in admiration. The praise filled the ears. This was the last battle for the Business University team in Shanghai, but unexpectedly, they suffered such a blow. The Business University team is scheduled to return east on the 28th.</p>
<p>Shanghai High School Wins Big and Triumphantly</p>
<p>Last night's battle was enjoyable and cathartic. The momentum of the University of Shanghai was like a river flowing thousands of miles. After Feng Nianci broke through the basket, the generals scored one after another, two after two, until they reached eleven points. Business University was still at zero. At the end of the first half, Shanghai High School won big and triumphantly with a score of 17 to 4.</p>
<p>▲ Business University Was Dumbfounded</p>
<p>Business University was no match. Starting from the second half, Shanghai High School strung together a series of baskets, one after another, creating a new record of 33 to 6. Business University was dejected and dumbfounded, helpless, with its teachers turning their backs on the city. The entries and exits were hectic, but the defense could not keep up, let alone the offense. They were at a loss. Shanghai High School originally had the determination not to let them score more than ten points, but Lu Zhonghui left due to a leg injury. In the last five minutes, the Shanghai High School reserve team played, ending the game with a score of 43 to 13.</p>
<p>▲ The Majesty Before the Southern Expedition</p>
<p>Shanghai High School will change its name to Yangshupu Team and depart for the Southern Expedition on the 29th, as reported earlier. This battle can be said to be a trial run before the Southern Expedition. It was indeed extremely sharp, cutting iron like mud. It is a dynamic force in the West China YMCA this winter. The whole team is far from what it used to be. During the attack, the three routes advanced simultaneously, attacking from the left and right. Business University lost sight of one thing while focusing on another. The speed of the army was swift and elusive. The passing was smooth, neither detached nor sticky. Long shots and close shots were effortless. Business University had no chance to get the ball. The initial five-person defense was like a facade. The subsequent zone defense was easily broken through by Shanghai High School, and they were exhausted from running. They never imagined that Shanghai High School basketball would be so dominant.</p>
<p>▲ Overview of the Business University Team</p>
<p>The Business University team came to Shanghai and played a total of seven games, with five losses and two wins. To summarize, physical strength is their characteristic, and agility is also commendable. They did not lose their bravery in battle, but there is still a long way to go in terms of coordination and shooting accuracy. Yongi and Jinzi are two strong players in the team. However, the Japanese are willing to work hard, so they should not be underestimated. We should also strive for progress every day. The results of the seven games are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Fan Hang vs. Business University 121 to 34 Business University wins</p>
<p>(2) Eagle Team vs. Business University 34 to 25 Eagle Team wins</p>
<p>(3) Artillery Team vs. Business University 31 to 35 Business University wins</p>
<p>(4) Fudan Alumni vs. Business University 26 to 19 Fudan Alumni wins</p>
<p>(5) Red Light vs. Business University 31 to 27 Red Light wins</p>
<p>(6) Chih Chih vs. Business University 32 to 20 Chih Chih wins</p>
<p>(7) Shanghai High School vs. Business University 43 to 13 Shanghai High School wins</p>

<h3>Triangular Swimming Competition, the United States Takes the Lead</h3>
<p>丨Total Score of Forty-three Points丨</p>
<p>Japan Second... Thirty-seven Points</p>
<p>China Third... Seventeen Points</p>
<p>▲Chris Breaks Shanghai Record in 100-Yard Breaststroke</p>
<p>The China-Japan-US triangular swimming competition was held at the YMCA swimming pool at 8 PM last night. Within two hours, the three countries competed against each other. As a result, the United States team won the championship with 43 points, Japan was second with 37 points, and China was third with 14 points. At the end of the battle, Fei Wusheng, the general secretary of the YMCA, presented the awards.</p>
<p>▲ The Nature of the Competition</p>
<p>This triangular competition was based on sports organizations. The Chinese team was temporarily organized by the Chinese Swimming Research Association, Japan was represented by the Japan Sports Association, and the United States was limited to YMCA members. It was called the China-Japan-US swimming competition, but in reality, it was just three groups in Shanghai, Japan, and the United States. Therefore, many good players from the three countries did not participate because they were limited by qualifications. Next year, the China National Sports Association plans to hold a grand international swimming competition, but there is no suitable swimming pool, so we can only wait until next year.</p>
<p>▲ One New Record</p>
<p>Among the nine events, except for the diving event, the 100-yard breaststroke performance was the best. Chris from the United States broke the record of 78 seconds set by Auster from the YMCA pool on November 12, 1929, with 77 seconds, creating a new Shanghai record. The 100-yard freestyle, the 100-yard medley, and the 100-yard backstroke were relatively good.</p>
<p>▲ China's Downturn</p>
<p>Not many of the Chinese team's players were skilled, and those who were proficient in the art stood by and watched. Therefore, in each competition, they fell behind step by step. Among the players, Yu Binqi, Yin Yanjun, and Tang Tianya were the most agile. Yu's start was unfavorable, and he was injured on the field, otherwise, it might have been more exciting.</p>
<p>▲ The United States Makes Great Efforts</p>
<p>In the first three events, the United States did not gain an advantage. They got eight points in the diving event and took the lead. It was not until the seventh event, the 200-yard medley, that no one entered the water. Before the third person's finger touched the edge of the pool, they were penalized and their position and points were canceled. As a result, the score ratio between the United States and Japan became 33 to 30, which was very close. The United States worked hard in the last two acts, hoping to take the lead. In the eighth act, Chris from the United States made a miraculous contribution, creating a new record. At that time, the United States took the lead by three points. The victory of the United States in the last event was already in their grasp, but they still won the championship with a fighting spirit, scoring 43 points.</p>
<p>▲ Japan Did Not Get Its Wish</p>
<p>Most of the events were Japan's strengths, so they had ambitions at the beginning of the competition. Sakakura, who attended the World Games, was also among them. In event after event, Japan competed with the United States for the lead, and repeatedly surpassed them. However, they suffered fatal injuries in the diving event and the 880-yard freestyle event, and ultimately fell behind the United States with 37 points, and retreated without getting their wish.</p>

<h3>The Davis Cup Final Is Unprecedented, England and France Are Evenly Matched</h3>
<p>丨Each Wins a Singles Group丨</p>
<p>丨15,500 Spectators丨</p>
<p>Paris, 24th - The weather is sunny and clear. The England-France Davis Cup Championship Final, the first day today, held at Roland Garros. The result is that the autumn colors are evenly divided, and each wins a singles group.</p>
<p>▲ Unprecedented Spectacle, 15,000 Spectators</p>
<p>Long before the start of the game, the stadium was already full. There were about 15,000 spectators, and there were thousands and thousands more outside the door who could not get in. The police tried their best to maintain order. The trees outside the venue were full of people, and the police could do nothing but let them do what they wanted. The grand occasion was unprecedented in history.</p>
<p>▲ Thrilling, the Shouts Were Thunderous</p>
<p>Because the strength of the two teams is evenly matched, and the fierce pre-war publicity, the victory and defeat of this game is unprecedented in tension. People from both sides cheered wildly, and the shouts shook the sky and the earth. Austin was thus frightened and defeated by Cochet. White kept calm, and Borotra was defeated.</p>
<p>▲ Results of the First and Second Singles</p>
<p>White (England) (4-6, 10-8, 6-0, 4-6, 6-4)</p>
<p>(Borotra (France))</p>
<p>Cochet (France) (3-6, 11-9, 6-2, 6-4)</p>
<p>Austin (England)</p>
<p>▲ White Wins Against Borotra</p>
<p>In the White-Borotra match, White had an excellent performance in the first set, but Borotra won 6-4. In the 18th game of the second set, Borotra's energy was exhausted and he lost. As a result, he was completely defeated in the third set, losing six games in a row. The fourth set was fiercely contested, and White won the last set with extremely accurate shots.</p>
<p>▲ Cochet Has Recovered His Original State</p>
<p>In the Cochet-Austin battle, Cochet had completely recovered to his original state before the typhoid fever. After failing in the first set, he often advanced to the front net to launch his artillery fire. In the 20th game, Cochet won 11-9. Austin was very good in the first set, and had a total of seven leads in the second set, but failed in the end. Unfortunately, he lost all his strength in the last two sets.</p>
<p>▲ The Victory or Defeat Depends on the Last Three Groups</p>
<p>Saturday is the doubles, and Sunday is the last two singles groups. Each won a singles group on the first day. England still insists that it is possible to win the cup. Considering the actual strength, it is not easy for France to win. The grand occasion of the spectators arises from this suspicion. However, France is more likely to win the doubles and the singles match between Cochet and White.</p>
<h3>Xianfang Cup Tennis League</h3>
<p>▲ The Order for Yesterday and Today Was Postponed Due to Rain</p>
<p>The first "Xianfang Cup" Tennis League was originally scheduled to open yesterday, but it was impossible to hold it as scheduled due to the continuous rain in recent days. Therefore, the organizing committee of the Cup held a meeting to discuss it, and a satisfactory solution was reached and the third notice was issued: Due to the continuous rain in recent days, all the courts are too wet, and the group matches originally scheduled for the 25th and 26th of this month are unlikely to be held as scheduled. In order to facilitate the convenience of each team and avoid multiple twists and turns, the group matches on the two days will be postponed. The postponement method is as follows, and I hope that each team will pay attention to it: The match originally scheduled for the 25th of this month will be postponed to August 23 (Sunday). The match originally scheduled for the 26th of this month will be postponed to August 29 (Saturday).</p>

<h3>Rain Affects Transportation</h3>
<p>▲ Jinghu Train Interrupted</p>
<p>Due to continuous heavy rain and flash floods between the Zhenjiang South Gate Station and Zhenjiang Station on the Jinghu Railway, the Baogai Mountain tunnel collapsed, and mountain soil was washed down, causing blockage. At the same time, the tracks at Hepingmen and other places were also washed away, causing trains to be stranded. This situation was reported yesterday. Here is a continuation of yesterday's situation:</p>
<p>▲ Disaster Situation The disaster area is vast. Almost no place from Xiashu Station is unaffected by the flood. The most severely affected area is Gaozi Station, where the water level is about six feet above the ground, making it impossible for station personnel to reside. They are now being relocated to 40-ton covered wagons. Xiashu, Longtan, Hepingmen, and other places are flooded to a depth of about three to four feet. Many sections of track between Yaohuamen, Taipingmen, and Qixia Mountain were washed away. The houses of nearby residents were also washed away and disappeared without a trace. The collapse of the Baogai Mountain tunnel between Zhenjiang and Zhenjiang South Gate Station was due to loose mountain soil being washed down, causing blockage. At the same time, soil from the hills on both sides of the track also flowed down with the water, completely burying the tunnel. The collapsed soil is estimated to be about 250 cubic meters. The engineering department is now working on opening ditches to drain the water. If there is no heavy rain and the water recedes slightly, the passage can be directly opened for traffic within one or two days.</p>
<p>▲ Rescue Process After receiving the news the day before yesterday afternoon, the railway bureau immediately instructed the chief engineer of the engineering department to go to inspect the disaster situation overnight. Chen Zhongying, the chief of the traffic section, also went along. Immediately, small workers from the entire railway were called to concentrate at Zhenjiang South Gate Station to await orders. The Zhenjiang section engineer also personally rode a handcar in the rain yesterday morning to investigate the stations to facilitate phased construction. On the Nanjing side, the engineer stationed in Nanjing also led small workers from Nanjing Station yesterday morning to dig ditches near the track to divert the water. At the same time, he ordered small workers from each road section to check the track and carry out repairs. Fortunately, there was no mountain soil blockage in this section, making it easier to start work. Therefore, by about 6:00 PM yesterday, almost all the danger had been averted. However, the Zhenjiang section was difficult to restore due to the mountain soil and the mountainous terrain, making it difficult to dig ditches and even more time-consuming to remove the mountain soil from the tracks. Therefore, it is still difficult to restore temporarily, and it will probably take another one or two days to complete the project. As for the losses of the affected residents along the way, they are countless and difficult to estimate at present.</p>
<p>▲ Traffic Conditions Yesterday (25th), the upstream and downstream passenger trains on the railway operated as usual, but only to Zhenjiang South Gate Station. Traffic between Zhenjiang and Nanjing was completely suspended. It is expected that traffic between Zhenjiang and Nanjing can be restored starting today. If there is no heavy rain during the day, the water recedes slightly, and the passage between Zhenjiang and Zhenjiang South Gate Station can also be cleared within one or two days. Today, all trains will still travel between Shanghai and Zhenjiang South Gate Station, it is said. It is still raining in the Zhenjiang area, but the rain in Nanjing has subsided slightly.</p>
<p>▲ Inland River Launches All Stopped</p>
<p>Continuous heavy rain has greatly affected inland river traffic in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. All inland river launches have been completely suspended. The reporter went to the inland river launch bureaus yesterday to conduct an on-site investigation. The known situation is described below:</p>
<p>▲ Lake Routes All Suspended A total of six companies operate morning and evening launch services from Shanghai to Huzhou. When the water rose on the 6th of this month, the morning launch service was suspended, but the night service still operated. Moreover, the Jiahu Line and Xihu Line launches were not blocked. Since the water level receded slightly last week, the morning launch service was also able to resume. However, since the 20th, the heavy rain has continued, and the water level in Huzhou has risen several feet, almost level with the bridge surface. The water police have received an order from the Construction Department to prohibit navigation. As of yesterday, not only were all six morning and evening lines in Shanghai suspended, but also the Jiahu, Suhu, and Xihu boats were completely suspended.</p>
<p>▲ Suzhou Launches All Suspended According to reports from various inland river launch bureaus in this port, the continuous heavy rain has caused the following routes to continue to be suspended: Suxi Line, Suchang Line, Sucheng Line, Zhenqing Line, Kunshan Line, Xipiao Line, Chengxi Line, Yixing, etc., totaling more than 30 routes. Inland river routes have been completely blocked. The reasons for the suspension are as follows: (1) The water is about to reach the level of the rice paddy banks, and villagers do not allow navigation; (2) After the water rises, launches cannot pass under the bridges.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Launches Suspended The Suzhou River area is where inland river launches concentrate, including Zhaoshang, Yuantong, Ruishengxiang, Zhengchang, Lixing, Qingji, Yongshun, Yong'an, Yutong, and other launch bureaus, with routes covering the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. As of yesterday, all of these launches had completely suspended operations. More than 100 launches, company cargo ships, and freighters were docked at the wharves. Because the launches are not operating, the livelihood of the dock workers is also greatly affected.</p>
<p>▲ Zhaoshang Losses The inland river Zhaoshang Bureau has a total of 26 routes. According to an official of the bureau yesterday, 23 routes within Jiangsu Province have been suspended due to flooding. Only the Shensu, Shenhang, and Shenjiao lines can barely operate. Yesterday, the Suzhou launch could not depart, and the Hangzhou launch could still operate if lightly loaded, but not if heavily loaded.</p>
<p>The head office has lost more than 8,000 yuan in the past 20 days due to the impact of the flood, from the 6th of this month to the present. The losses of the branch offices are not included.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai-Yichang Air Service Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Yichang air service has been temporarily suspended yesterday due to continuous rain, which is not conducive to flying, and the Ming Xiaoling airfield in Nanjing has become a swamp, making it impossible for airplanes to take off and land. It will resume operations depending on the weather.</p>
<p>▲ Telephone Lines in the Concession Blocked</p>
<p>During the torrential rain and thunderstorms yesterday morning, the telephone lines installed by the telephone bureau in the Ningbo Road area of the French Concession suddenly broke down. As a result, telephone users in that area were unable to make calls from yesterday morning until late in the evening. It is reported that the telephone company is now dispatching workers to repair the lines as quickly as possible. It is expected that the situation will be restored to normal today.</p>
<h3>Various Circles Send Telegrams to Condemn Shi</h3>
<p>▲ Three District Party Headquarters Send Telegram The Three District Party Headquarters issued a telegram yesterday condemning Shi, which reads (abridged): Shi Yusan is fickle and repeatedly betrays the country. Our Central Government has been lenient and has not investigated deeply. However, Shi Yusan did not think about repaying the favor with loyalty to the country. Instead, he dared to accept the name and money of the Guangdong reactionary faction and the instigation of Japanese imperialists. He took advantage of our Central Government's efforts to suppress bandits and the urgent Sino-Japanese diplomatic situation to suddenly rebel and raise troops to make trouble. Such fickleness and incorrigibility cannot be tolerated by national law. Our National Government has already issued an order to dismiss him from his post and arrest him. It is hoped that all armies and divisions will join in the attack, and all circles of the country will jointly condemn him to eliminate this scourge and pacify the rebellion. The Party and the country will be fortunate (omitted below).</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Sends Telegram The Shanghai Municipal Government sends an urgent telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang of Beiping, Party Headquarters and Governments of all provinces and cities, Commanders-in-Chief of all group armies, Military Governors, Chief Commanders, Commanders, and Commanders of all armies, divisions, and brigades, and requests all newspapers to forward it to all organizations: We have received Deputy Commander Zhang's telegram, Chairman Liu of Kaifeng and others' telegram, Chairman Zhang of Jilin and others' telegram, and Chairman He of Hankou and others' telegram. Since the Red bandits have caused chaos, the people are suffering, and the living beings are plunged into misery. It is a great disaster for the nation and a hidden worry for the Party and the country. All our comrades and compatriots should be of one heart and one mind, correct the chaos, and stabilize the situation. Unexpectedly, when the Red bandits in Guangchang and Ningdu were being wiped out, we heard the news of Shi Yusan's rebellion in Shunde and Shijiazhuang. If there was no collusion, why would he be so mad? If a snake is not killed when it is small, it will become a big problem. Moreover, strong neighbors are watching us, and their conspiracies are rampant. Foreign troubles and domestic worries are mutually causal. It is like treating a disease, you must first remove the evil, and then the vitality can be restored and external pathogens will not enter. Now the Commander-in-Chief is commanding the troops to suppress the bandits, and purification is expected. The Deputy Commander is leading the troops to suppress the rebellion, and pacification is not far away. All of you share the same hatred and speak out for justice. Your prestige has reached the sea. It is hoped that all provincial military and civilian officials, local organizations, and the people will jointly express their righteous indignation and rise up together to support righteousness and eliminate evil, and quell internal strife to resist foreign aggression, so that the violent bandits will not revive, and the rebellious elements will not escape the law. In this way, peace and unity can be achieved as soon as possible, and the grand plan for a hundred years can be completed in time to build and comfort the people's hopes and open up the great blueprint for the Party and the country. The spirits of the Prime Minister and all the martyrs in heaven will bless us. We respectfully express our sincerity, and we hope you will understand. The Shanghai Municipal Government respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a telegram yesterday based on the resolution of the Provisional General Meeting of Members, which reads: To the military and civilian officials of all provinces: Since the Japanese widely dispatched armed police to Wanbaoshan to forcibly occupy farmland, the situation is turbulent, as if facing a great enemy. They also discussed changing one division of the army that had previously occupied South Manchuria and was due to be replaced into a fixed service unit. At the same time, they paid attention to the replenishment of weapons and the research of chemical poison gas. Everyone knows that the target is the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Moreover, due to the success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, its heavy industry is making great strides, the Japanese have the ambition to get there first, and they are even more arrogant than before. Although we are extremely tolerant, they provoke us at any time. It is difficult to predict when the fire will break out. Our troops have been exhausted by internal warfare for many years, and there is no opportunity to reorganize and train, so there is little ability to resist insults and resolve conflicts. In the Sino-Soviet Zhalaiman War in the middle of last year, the Russians only tested their strength and did not mobilize the forces of the whole country. However, our army, which has always been known as brave and fierce, met them suddenly and was defeated like soup pouring on snow. They bowed their heads and made an alliance under the city of Boli. This shows that if internal strife does not stop, national defense will never be consolidated. Such a profound lesson, if the person is not completely alienated from the country and abandoned by the people, should not be ignored. However, when the diplomatic situation is very tense and the remnants of the Red bandits have not been wiped out, Shi Bu of Shunde suddenly took free action, destroying the Zhanghe Railway Bridge and occupying Shijiazhuang. This is enough to increase the anxiety of the central government and to give encouragement and assistance to those with ambition. According to recent reports, Central Representative Shao said that Shi Bu was the only one who undermined peace, and the central government had taken appropriate precautions against him. However, he still hoped that Shi would have a final awakening and resign voluntarily, and the central government would still be lenient to Shi Bu. This shows that the central government, in order to eliminate violence and settle the chaos, although it has no choice but to use force, but in order to take care of the overall situation and consider the people's livelihood, still hopes for a chance for him to repent and avoid the connection of troops and the shaking of the foundation of the country. All of you love the party and the country, and you are admired by China and foreign countries. You should, with the national justice and the brotherhood, give your advice to Shi, and if you can rein in at the edge of the cliff and get out of the team, so that the storm can disappear, then the country can preserve some vitality, and your department can also avoid meaningless sacrifices. You will not lose your bright and upright, and be brave in covering up the evening. Moreover, from now on, be aware of the sincerity that disasters will come at any time, seek a unified plan against foreign countries, and lay a foundation for a peaceful and unified country, and express your loyalty to defend the frontier. Urgent words, I hope you will understand. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Association Seizes a Large Batch of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>▲ Worth About 200,000 Taels</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Chamber of Commerce Starts to Handle Registration</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Committee has been very busy with registration and inspection work in recent days. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, after a resolution passed at the General Meeting of Members, has also begun to register Japanese goods. All member stores belonging to various trade associations can go to collect registration forms. Currently, the customs declaration and transportation industries have resolved not to load or transport Japanese goods due to the strict seizure of goods by the Anti-Japanese Association. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ A Large Batch of Japanese Goods Seized Since the Anti-Japanese Committee announced the measures for the disposal of Japanese goods on the 16th, all Japanese goods are not allowed to be moved. Some unscrupulous merchants took advantage of the inspection work not yet started to rush to load and transport the goods, so that the Japanese inventory was sold out. After hearing the report, the association was very heartbroken, and immediately ordered the inspection section to hurry up and start work in advance. As a result, on the 22nd and 23rd, a large batch of Japanese goods was found at the South Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the Maigen Road warehouse. The companies and quantities of loading and transportation are as follows: Huatong Company, five boxes of foreign cloth and groceries; Commercial Company, ten boxes and two pieces of groceries, porcelain tableware, galoshes, mast lights, hardware, and straw hats; Dahua Company, two boxes of newspapers; Commercial Company, ten boxes of pigments, mirrors, lampshades, groceries, and galoshes, and one piece of thick cloth; Xueji Yanghe Fine Five Pieces; Gongchang Chong Biji Chong Zhigong Two Boxes; Hengchun Stationery One Box, Smell of Head Medicine, Hardware Yellow Wax Photo Card Seafood Fish Newspaper Groceries Forty-Three Pieces; Shen Tai Transport to Various Places Eleven Boxes; Dong Ji Electric Materials, Felt Hats Four Boxes; Yuantong Transport to Nanjing Four Hundred and Fifty-Two Pieces, Transport to Zhenjiang Sixty-Two Pieces, Transport to Wuxi Two Pieces, Suzhou Six Pieces, Hangzhou Twenty-Nine Pieces; Qingji Piece Goods Cotton Yarn Two Hundred and Seventy-Seven Pieces; Express Piece Goods Package Piece Goods Three Pieces; Hengxing Fine Twill Five Packages, Foreign Cloth Five Disassembled Pieces; Dabing Grade Color Zhigong Ten Boxes. The above-mentioned Japanese goods seized totaled fifty-five boxes, eight hundred and eighty-seven pieces, and five packages. Now, the association believes that this batch of Japanese goods is the first case they have found, and the disposal method cannot but be particularly cautious. It will be submitted to the plenary committee meeting for decision. Before the decision is made, anyone who speaks for the unscrupulous merchants will be severely punished in accordance with the two punitive regulations. It is reported that the total value of these goods is about 250,000 taels. ▲ Chamber of Commerce Handles Registration The Chamber of Commerce began to handle registration yesterday after a resolution passed at the General Meeting of Members. The methods are as follows: (1) The registration of Japanese goods is limited to those purchased before the 14th; (2) During the registration period, all goods must not be moved; (3) After the registration is completed, the goods will be allowed to be sold in accordance with the regulations; (4) The registration is limited to store members belonging to trade associations that have joined the Chamber of Commerce. Non-members should register directly with the Anti-Japanese Association. (6) The registration period ends on August 6th and will not be extended. (6) If the unregistered goods are seized in the future, the Chamber of Commerce will no longer speak on their behalf. (7) Registration forms and all information can be inquired from the Commercial Section.</p>
<p>▲ Customs Declaration Workers Express The Shanghai Customs Declaration Industry Workers' Association sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association yesterday, stating that all colleagues in our association, as members of the people, should participate in fulfilling their duties. For this reason, an emergency meeting was convened yesterday to discuss the boycott plan. After the members made various proposals, they thought that the procedures were quite difficult, and the losses from interception and transportation were huge. Therefore, after detailed discussion, it was decided to order all members to clear the procedures in the shortest possible time and stop loading and transporting, so as to be the backing of your association and fulfill the duty of patriotic movement. Therefore, we hereby send a reply in advance, hoping for your consideration.</p>
<p>▲ Bengbu Refuses to Load Japanese Goods The Anti-Japanese Association received a telegram from the Bengbu Transit Association yesterday, sent on the 22nd, which reads: To the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Association, the people across the country are indignant at the massacre of overseas Chinese in the Wanbaoshan case. Today's general meeting of our association unanimously resolved to implement the boycott of Japanese goods from today, based on your association's telegram. In addition to notifying the industry, we will refuse to load and unload from today. Bengbu Transit Association kowtows.</p>
<p>A Letter from the Color Printing Association A letter from the Color Printing Industry Association to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce reads: To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, we respectfully start. Since the tragic case of the Korean overseas Chinese occurred, all people with blood are indignant. The accumulation of weakness in our country is not enough to make Japan realize that if the people of the whole country do not unanimously implement economic severance. It has been found that the number of colored printed products used in various industries in the city is very large, especially the cigarette industry, which often orders from Japanese-owned printing factories, and the annual leakage is huge. Our association has repeatedly advised various industries that all printed products used by Chinese should be ordered from Chinese printing factories in order to recover the rights and interests. At this time, when the whole country is boycotting Japanese goods, I think the patriotic heart of the cigarette industry and all industries must be sympathetic. The items that have always been ordered from Japanese printing factories must have been automatically changed to Chinese printing factories. However, it is still inevitable that people who are hesitant to wait and see. Please ask your association to notify all industries that all kinds of printed products will be printed by Chinese printing factories in the future, and implement economic severance with Japanese businessmen to wash away national humiliation. I can't hope enough. The Shanghai Color Printing Industry Association starts.</p>
<p>▲ Notice from the Grain and Oil Industry Association The Grain, Oil, and Oilcake Industry Association convened a general meeting of all colleagues yesterday to discuss the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Affair and the handling of Japanese goods. After public resolution, (A) all kinds of spot goods transported by Japanese ships that have arrived in Shanghai or have been stored in Japanese warehouses, (B) all kinds of road goods that have been transported by Japanese ships but have not yet arrived in Shanghai, (C) all orders for wheat from Europe, America, and Australia, and Xiangmi rice from Yangon and Saigon, etc., that have been ordered from Japanese companies, (D) all goods that have been ordered from Western companies, have been ordered on Japanese ships, but have not yet been transported. The above four items must be truthfully registered with our association from today until July 27. Those who do not comply with the registration deadline will be rejected from buying and selling by our association. The registration method is that all colleagues who transport goods by Japanese ships or store them in Japanese warehouses should copy the</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>list or detailed account and submit it to our association for registration. After our association receives the list or detailed account, it will stamp the receipt. All our colleagues must comply with the announcement of the resolutions to the industry. This matter is related to foreign affairs, so please do not make a mistake.</p>
<p>▲ Notice from the Transit Industry Association The Shanghai-Hangzhou Transit Industry Association issued a notice yesterday regarding the refusal to transport Japanese goods, which reads: It is for public announcement that the whole country is angry at the tragic abuse of overseas Chinese by the Japanese. Implementing economic severance is the main plan. Now the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Committee has been established in the city. Our industry also belongs to the people, and there is no difference. Except for the Japanese goods that have been entrusted to transport earlier and are still stranded in the warehouse due to the lack of vehicles, and have been checked out, and are waiting for a quiet settlement to avoid losing money, after the temporary members' conversation, it was decided to refuse to transport Japanese goods, and to add a penalty to those who change their appearance and secretly entrust the goods, and those who take the risk to transport them. This is hereby announced, hoping for the understanding of all circles.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing's Talk on Boycotting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The National News Agency reporter met with Mr. Yu Qiaqing yesterday and asked if there were any supplements to the speech that Mr. Yu gave at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce General Meeting of Members on the 25th, as reported in today's newspapers. Mr. Yu said that there were still some errors and omissions in the manuscript, so he made the following questions: (Question) Has Mr. Yu attended the Anti-Japanese Association meeting? (Answer) I have not attended. (Question) Why not? (Answer) Because the association elected me as the chairman, and the scope of economic severance is too broad, and the chairman should be any one of the chairman's group of the Chamber of Commerce, because merchants should be the main body of the boycott. (Question) Since Mr. Yu did not attend the Anti-Japanese Association, why did he attend the Chamber of Commerce yesterday? (Answer) Because I am a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and the Chamber of Commerce held a General Meeting of Members yesterday, and it is my duty to attend. And I am afraid that various industries may have various misunderstandings, so I can explain everything. Now I will tell you what I said yesterday again. When this boycott movement occurred, Japanese yarn rose sharply by 20 taels, and domestic yarn also rose by 3 or 4 taels. Merchants from all over the country rushed to buy Japanese goods, and the Japanese goods in Shanghai were transported and loaded empty. These are all done by those who seek profit. As for the economic severance advocated by the Anti-Japanese Association, the scope is very broad, and it is not something that merchants can do. What merchants do is only to rely on their conscience and automatically boycott. Therefore, the boycott can only be done by merchants uniting on their own. As for the methods and abuses, the patriotic boycott movement in our country should follow the boycott methods of the Japanese people. Take a look at the Japanese people living abroad. All daily necessities are used from their own country. It can be seen that the Japanese people's patriotic boycott is all from the conscience and has become a habit. It is not just talking about the boycott on the mouth, but the movement to carry out the story. The boycott should also have a certain scope. For example, raw materials that China does not have and other countries do not have cannot be boycotted, so as not to cause factories to stop and workers to lose their jobs. In this boycott, workers should work harder to manufacture and produce more goods, and do not leave the factory to join the movement, so that they will have strength. Capitalists should also set up more factories, and factories should not take the opportunity to raise prices. On the part of the Chinese people, they must be united and cooperative. For those who operate Japanese goods, they should not be made to suffer unwarranted losses, so that they can gradually switch to selling domestic products. And the existing Japanese goods should be cleared periodically, so as to avoid social and economic losses. I am very opposed to the quick seizure of goods, and the Chamber of Commerce did not notify in advance, and the procedures are too hasty. The Chamber of Commerce should ask the Anti-Japanese Association to return the seized Japanese goods. On the government's side, it is a mistake to increase tariffs on the export of local goods. It should increase import taxes and reduce export taxes, so that domestic goods can be in a protected position. Fortunately, the authorities have realized this, and are in the process of reducing and exempting export taxes on local goods. Moreover, the country is now in a time of trouble. In the north, there is Shi Yusan, in the south, there is the division of Guangdong, and in the middle, there is the rampant of the Communist Party. The government's position is very difficult. Japan takes the opportunity to commit violence. The Chinese people should take care of both internal and external affairs, and act cautiously. Do not indulge in a moment of anger, and leave a pain that will be bitten in the navel. (Question) Does the first person have other insights? (Answer) The Japanese authorities are divided into two factions, one faction is aggressive, and the other is peaceful. Therefore, our people should not treat the Japanese authorities the same. As for the people in their country, as far as I know, most of them advocate friendship with our country. When I went to Japan, there were 20,000 to 30,000 people at the Tokyo National Congress who declared that they did not support their government's aggressive policy and were very willing to be friendly with China. Therefore, our country should pay attention to the actions of the Japanese government. Therefore, this incident is determined to be the purpose of backing up diplomacy. This response should focus not only on the issues of punishing the murderers, apologizing, and compensating, but also on the prompt signing of a fair and equal commercial treaty between China and Japan, so that the relationship between China and Japan has legal protection. Moreover, this point can also prove whether the Japanese government is friendly to China or is an aggressor against China. Because the old Sino-Japanese treaty has been abolished, and the new treaty has not been concluded, it is actually an international country without a treaty. Therefore, whether the Japanese government is willing to conclude a fair and equal treaty with China is a major boundary between its aggression and friendship.</p>
<h3>Commander Xiong's Two Telegrams to Mayor Zhang</h3>
<p>▲Re-transmitting Sun Dianying's Telegram</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang received a telegram yesterday from Commander Xiong in Nanchang, which read: "Mayor Zhang Yuejun, Shanghai, with highest respect: I have received a telegram from General Headquarters, quoting Sun Dianying's shortened message: 'Throughout Kuiyuan's life, he has been loyal to superiors and friendly to peers, upholding the principles of trust and righteousness. I hope my sincerity will be understood. All the circumstances here have been discussed with Councilor Fu Xingqiao,' etc. Furthermore, General Headquarters received a telegram from Mr. Sun Fumo, which read: 'I have received and carefully read the Xianhai telegram. Your earnest intentions are deeply appreciated. Although my brother lacks learning and skills, he deeply loves peace and supports the Party and the nation, not wanting to lag behind others. Han Zhang acted impulsively and made a regrettable mistake. Throughout his life, my brother has valued trust and righteousness over personal gain, willing to face any hardship for what is right. Otherwise, he would never sacrifice public interest for personal grievances or disrupt peace for individual concerns. Moreover, Han's character is inconsistent and unpredictable. His actions speak for themselves. Outsiders, unaware of the truth, often say 'Shi and Sun are like this and that.' Why bother arguing with idle talk? You know my brother well, and I believe you can understand. I hope you can offer guidance in your spare time. I eagerly await your instructions. Respectfully replying, I wish you good health and success. Your brother, Sun Kuiyuan, bows respectfully.' The signature is Xiao Yin, etc. Respectfully announced by your younger brother, Xiong Shihui. [Seal]"</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang also received another telegram from Commander Xiong yesterday, which read: "Mayor Zhang Yuejun, Shanghai, with highest respect: The advance headquarters received a telegram from Division Commander Sun Kuiyuan, which read: 'I have received a report from Instructor Liu of the Student Battalion of my division, stating that the instructor was carrying the division's passport, returning home from duty. When passing through Baoding, he was questioned and detained by inspectors, mistaken for a member of Shi Yousan's troops. He was detained for a day before being released after a detailed explanation by a friend.' Recently, rumors have resurfaced, and the spread of gossip can easily lead to misinformation and confusion. Although I lack learning and skills, I am filled with righteousness. For as long as I live, I will never do anything ungrateful or disloyal, to be scorned by the group or cursed by posterity. As for Shi's character, please allow me to explain it to you, my superior. Last January, he was forced into a difficult situation in Bengbu and repeatedly sought help. At that time, I was in western Henan and marched urgently through the rain to his aid. Later, when he retreated to Guide, adjacent to our defense zone, we agreed on a mutual defense alliance. However, he retreated to Zhengzhou overnight without notifying us, leaving my troops surrounded. In the battle of Bozhou, my entire army nearly perished. This is the first instance of his lack of trustworthiness. Later, when the main force suffered losses and retreated across the river, his troops confiscated over four thousand of our guns, adding insult to injury by taking advantage of our vulnerability. This is the second instance of his lack of trustworthiness. Such instances are too numerous to list. It speaks poorly of one's judgment to be unaware of such things. Throughout my life, what I have been admired for is trust and righteousness, and what I respect is integrity. What can I gain from Shi? Furthermore, since coming under your command for reorganization, the officers and soldiers have been well-provided for with clothing and food. Stationing in Huanpu has given us a good leader. We obey orders and remain steadfast. However, the newspapers spread rumors, and busybodies refer to 'Shi and Sun' or 'Sun and Shi.' This is truly being overly clever, judging Kuiyuan with the mind of a petty person. Although Kuiyuan is foolish, he would not stoop so low. Past events are vivid in my mind, and there is no need for further explanation. However, I am concerned that rumors may affect my reputation and that the movement of officers and soldiers returning home may be hampered. I earnestly hope that you will consider my sincerity and issue orders to all troops to exempt officers and soldiers of my division returning home with proper registration from inspection. This is my earnest hope. I offer my sincere and direct statement, and I humbly request your consideration. I have entrusted Councilor Fu with a personal report on all matters concerning my troops, and I believe he can provide further details.' Respectfully submitted, Xiong Shihui. [Seal]"</p>
<h3>The Third District Party Headquarters Exposes Chen Youren's Conspiracy to Go to Japan</h3>
<p>▲Flattering the Japanese Side and Secretly Selling Out the Country</p>
<p>▲The Entire Nation Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Third District Party Headquarters of this city issued a circular telegram yesterday, stating: "On the 23rd of this month, Shanghai newspapers reported that Chen Youren and his wife, along with Liu Jiwen and Gan Jihou, dispatched by the Guangdong faction, arrived in Japan this morning (i.e., the 22nd) at 6:40 a.m. aboard the Japanese postal ship 'Kitano Maru' and immediately proceeded to Tokyo. They are scheduled to spend a week discussing Sino-Japanese issues with Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara and figures from the Japanese government and opposition parties. On the ship, Chen Youren changed his name to the Japanese name 'Toyama Yuzo,' and his wife changed her name to 'Michiko.' After landing, they avoided all meetings. Before Chen's departure for Japan, the Guangdong faction first declared to the Japanese Consul-General in Guangdong, acting on behalf of Suma, that they were specially dispatching Chen Youren and others to exchange views with the Japanese foreign affairs authorities. The Japanese government replied that they could not be received as official representatives but could be treated as prominent figures from a neighboring country, etc. After reading this, doubts arose. The illegitimacy of the pseudo-government in Guangdong has been clearly announced to the people and the world by our National Government. Neither the people of the country nor the various countries of the world recognize it as a legitimate government. Now, Chen Youren and others are going to Japan under the mandate of the Guangdong pseudo-government to discuss Sino-Japanese issues and engage in some secret agreement. Their illegal actions are obvious. The Japanese government, instead of rejecting them as an interference in our country's internal strife, treats them as prominent figures from a neighboring country in an attempt to conceal their intentions. This clearly shows that the Guangdong faction is colluding with Japanese imperialism in an attempt to prolong the life of their reactionary group, and that Japanese imperialism is using the Guangdong reactionary group in an attempt to prolong the internal strife in our country. Otherwise, why would Chen Youren and the others all change into Japanese names and avoid all meetings after landing? Their attempt to ingratiate themselves with Japanese imperialism and engage in a secret agreement and treasonous acts is clear for all to see. Japan has always been unwilling to see the realization of peaceful unification in our country. Whenever there is internal strife and reaction in our country, they will take the opportunity to spread rumors and confuse right and wrong. Although they claim on the surface that inviting Chen Youren and others is not a recognition of the reactionary faction by the Japanese side, their attitude towards the internal strife in our country remains the same. Sino-Japanese issues, as well as the recent tragic incident in Japan and Korea, are naturally handled through negotiations by our legitimate National Government. Since the Guangdong pseudo-government is illegal, what right do they have to preside over these matters? What basis does the Japanese side have to accept negotiations? The Japanese side's invitation to Chen Youren and others is actually a way to delay Sino-Japanese issues, directly and indirectly providing the Guangdong faction with various conveniences, prolonging the internal strife in our country, and allowing them to profit from it. This is very clear. This committee clearly sees their hidden motives and discerns their treachery. In addition to requesting the Central Committee to immediately instruct the general branch in Japan to pay close attention and to forward this to the National Government to immediately notify the Japanese Party authorities to refuse Chen and others' negotiations and to expel them from the country, we are exposing their conspiracy to the world. We hope that all countries in the world will pay attention together. If the Japanese side accepts Chen's negotiations and exchanges views and engages in any secret agreement, they should be unanimously rejected. This is a special telegram. We hope you will take note. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Third District of the Chinese Kuomintang, bows with seal."</p>
<h3>Chen Jilie, Executive Committee Member of the French Branch, Discusses Overseas Chinese's Eager Hope for Peaceful Unification</h3>
<p>▲Returning to China to Report to the Central Committee on Party Affairs and the Situation of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>▲The Education of the Children of Chinese Laborers Who Participated in the War</p>
<p>The French branch of the Chinese Kuomintang has specially dispatched Chen Jilie, a member of the executive committee, as a representative to return to the country to report to the Central Committee on party affairs and the situation of overseas Chinese. Mr. Chen arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed him at his residence and had the following conversation: (The mission of this trip) Mr. Chen is a graduate of the Department of Law of Peking University, a Master of Law from the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris, a graduate of the Paris Municipal Academy, and a member of the executive committee of the French branch. This time, he is returning to the country to report to the Central Committee on the situation of the French branch's party affairs, party fees, and the needs of the party affairs address. He will also present the situation of overseas Chinese to express the wishes of the students of the University of Paris. (Overseas Chinese hope for governance) Overseas Chinese hope for peaceful unification in the country and for the increase of our international status. This is extremely urgent. The Guangdong incident was caused by differences in political views and extreme actions. This kind of situation is a necessary phenomenon in politics and is not surprising at first. However, even if political views are different and disputes are fierce, everyone must have a common principle to uphold, that is, no matter what, military force should never be used as the backing of political disputes, opening the door to slaughter and causing internal strife to spread. Moreover, now that the red disaster is rampant and bandits are everywhere, the oppression of aggressive ideologies is increasing. At this time, if we start a conflict and destroy peaceful unification, our international status will plummet, and there will be no day to abolish unequal treaties. Our party governs with party principles and adopts a democratic centralism system for the use of party power and political power. All proposals can be publicly promoted, legally discussed, reconciled with law and justice, and finally decided by the majority. Therefore, not using military force as the backing of political disputes and actually implementing a democratic centralism system is the principle that everyone should jointly abide by to resolve the current situation. (Chinese laborers who participated in the war) During the European War, Chinese laborers who participated in the war helped France a lot. Therefore, there are many Chinese laborers who married in France, and there are quite a few who have children. According to French common practice, even if the children are born of a Chinese father and a French mother, they are still of French nationality. However, they can act freely after the age of twenty-one. Therefore, attention should be paid to the education of these children. If they are not taught Chinese characters and Chinese, will they still have the concept of nationality in the future? The Chinese Laborers Who Participated in the War Committee, organized by the French branch, is currently preparing to establish a Chinese school to provide them with appropriate education. As for the reason for the organization of the committee, it is because French workers are squeezing out Chinese workers, and many Chinese workers have lost their jobs as a result. After repeated negotiations with the French authorities by the committee, many have resumed work, but there are still one or two hundred unemployed. This trip plans to request the Central Committee to find a way to summon them back to the country, give them work to cure the root cause, and allocate funds for relief to treat the symptoms. (Dormitories at the University of Paris) In 1921, the French philanthropist Monsieur Maishu allocated 28 hectares of land to the University of Paris, named it the University City of Paris, and notified various countries that all students studying at the school could build student dormitories in the University City (the site is south of Paris, about five or six Chinese miles) by their respective governments. Many European and American countries have built their own dormitories, but we are the only ones who have not. At that time, there were more than 600 Chinese students in France, who formed a preparatory committee for the Chinese Students Association of the University City of Paris to promote the construction of this building, but so far they have not been able to do so. (Paris newspapers) The Chinese newspaper in Paris, "Party Voice in Europe," promotes the Three Principles of the People. It has now ceased publication. "Zhongshan Daily" promotes news from the motherland and general overseas Chinese. "New China" introduces news from the motherland to the French people in Western languages to make them understand the true situation of our country. (Gao Lu returns to China) Mr. Chen departed from France on May 30. He made short stays in Switzerland, Singapore, and Annam along the way. Before leaving, he met with Minister Gao and learned that he was about to return to China, but there was no definite date at that time. (Entering Beijing soon) Mr. Chen originally planned to enter Beijing today, but the Shanghai-Beijing road was blocked by water, so he will have to wait a little longer. He will enter Beijing as soon as the trains are running.</p>
<h3>The Sichuan Fellow Association Cables the National Government to Prohibit Liu Wenhui from Purchasing Foreign Weapons</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai telegraphed the National Government yesterday, stating: "The province of Sichuan suffers greatly from excessive military presence. To have one province's people supporting three or four hundred thousand troops is truly a unique and strange phenomenon in the country. Supposedly, this is to take on national defense, but we see Xikang, which is as close as lips and teeth, being almost entirely occupied by Tibetan bandits, and we never hear of them increasing troops to go to Kang. Supposedly, this is to transform it into a military industry, but the result of the continuous recruitment of troops by the various armies is that we only see the chemical industry becoming soldiers, and we do not see the transformation of soldiers into workers. The military disasters suffered by the people cannot be described in words. All those who care about Sichuan affairs regard the reorganization and demobilization of troops as the only urgent task at present. However, Liu Wenhui, the chairman of Sichuan Province, and Liu Xiang, the director of post-war affairs, are secretly establishing military factories and purchasing foreign weapons to expand their military power. At the same time, they are requesting the Central Committee to issue post-war public bonds and provincial public bonds, claiming to use them for the reorganization and demobilization of troops. According to a reliable investigation by this association, in addition to Liu Xiang's control of key points along the Yangtze River, allowing him to purchase weapons from foreign countries at any time, the number of guns in his troops has increased from more than 30,000 to more than 100,000 since 1927, and there are also various new types of weapons. Liu Wenhui also sent Xiang Yuren to Shanghai with 11.5 million yuan in cash to purchase weapons from the Jiguo Company. A batch has already been shipped back, but it was seized by Wang Lingji, the commander of Liu Xiang's troops, in Wanxian. Wenhui's trip to Chongqing this time is to negotiate this matter with Liu Xiang. The two Lius requested the issuance of public bonds, claiming that they were unable to reorganize and demobilize troops due to a lack of funds. Judging from the above facts, their so-called use of public bonds to save the poor and save the army is becoming increasingly clumsy, and they have exposed their true colors. This association has a responsibility to save Sichuan, so we earnestly request your government to: (1) Strictly order all troops in Sichuan to stop purchasing weapons from foreign countries, and order the Ministry of Military Affairs not to issue weapons passports indiscriminately to Sichuan military leaders. (2) Order the Ministry of Military Affairs to send personnel to take over the Chengdu and Chongqing armories and other gun factories, and bring them all under state ownership, prohibiting any military personnel from privately owning them. (3) Telegraph Liu Xiang, ordering him to hand over the military equipment seized from Liu Wenhui in Wanxian to the Central Committee and not to use it without authorization. (4) Instruct the customs offices along the Yangtze River to search and seize the military equipment that Liu Wenhui and other Sichuan troops continue to transport and confiscate it. (5) Order Liu Xiang and others to submit a roster of the troops to be reorganized and demobilized, and not to request the issuance of demobilization fees or the issuance of any public bonds until the Central Committee has sent personnel to verify and confirm them. The above five points are the only key to stopping the chaos in Sichuan and saving the people of Sichuan today. We believe that your government, as a revolutionary government, will certainly not tolerate the perverse actions of such people and will comfort the people of Sichuan who are looking forward to it. We send this telegram for your consideration and await your instructions. The Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai, bows respectfully."</p>
<h3>The U.S. Consulate's Statement After the Verdict in the Qu-Ma Case</h3>
<p>▲A Letter to the Municipal Government Expressing Regret</p>
<p>The case of U.S. sailors injuring Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang and shooting Gu Jingen has been adjudicated, the details of which have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that U.S. Consul General Cunningham sent a letter of apology to the Municipal Government yesterday, expressing his goodwill. The original letter is recorded below: "In response to your letter No. 2846 of June 8, which stated that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce forwarded a letter from the Anhui Fellow Association in Shanghai regarding the injury of Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang by U.S. sailors, this Consul General has the following to request your honorable Mayor's attention. As soon as the fight occurred, the U.S. Marine Corps commander in Shanghai was informed, and the commander immediately ordered a detailed investigation. After the investigation, the sailors who participated in the fight were subjected to a military court. This military court is still in progress. To make all parties aware of this unfortunate event, the military court is known to be proceeding fairly and impartially. Repeated trials are open to the public, and the Anhui Fellow Association in Shanghai has also appointed representatives to attend the court. All those found to be responsible for this unfortunate event will be duly punished. Your honorable Mayor can be assured of this and need not worry. The letter also mentions the case of Gu Jingen. After Gu Jingen was shot, the officials in charge of the Public Concession inspected the body on April 23 of this year. 'The case was listed as Huishan No. 4736.' At that time, it was decided that the U.S. sailor opened fire in self-defense. When the inspection was completed, the prosecutor told the deceased's brother that if he disagreed with the ruling, he could file a lawsuit with the U.S. Court for China. Regarding the occurrence of this type of unfortunate event, there is one more point that this Consul General should request your honorable Mayor's attention. That is, any Chinese person who feels aggrieved by any American can report the detailed circumstances and evidence to Dr. Shi, the prosecutor of the U.S. Court for China. If the evidence appears to show a criminal offense, the U.S. prosecutor will immediately file a lawsuit against the American involved without waiting for the plaintiff to proceed. If there is no evidence of criminal conduct, the Chinese person can still file a civil lawsuit against the American with the U.S. Court for China. According to U.S. practice, the procedures for civil lawsuits are slightly different from those for criminal lawsuits. Civil lawsuits are not initiated by the U.S. prosecutor. The person who claims to be harmed must file a lawsuit with the U.S. Court for China against the person who is believed to have caused the harm. As for filing such lawsuits, the U.S. Court for China is available to all Chinese people and will conduct fair and impartial trials at all times. This point is well known to your honorable Mayor and does not require further confirmation from this Consul General. This Consul General deeply regrets the unfortunate occurrences mentioned in the letter. However, the sensationalist announcements in the local newspapers do not help prove the guilt of the parties involved and harm the long-standing cordial relations between our two governments. If the victims file lawsuits with the appropriate courts to determine whether the defendants are guilty or not, such damage to friendship should be avoided. This Consul General earnestly requests your honorable Mayor to forward the points mentioned in this letter to the relevant Chinese organizations and inform them that this Consul General has made a firm guarantee that any American who commits any criminal act will be prosecuted immediately according to law if evidence is presented to this Consul General or to the U.S. prosecutor. Any Chinese person who suffers harm caused by an American can use the U.S. Court for China, and your honorable Mayor can also be assured that the court will render a fair judgment without any doubt. This is because this office fundamentally desires to maintain the friendship that it has always had with the Chinese government and the Chinese people. The foregoing is acknowledged. It is respectfully replied for your information."</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Bitter Rain</h3>
<p>▲Low-lying Areas Have Become Lakes</p>
<p>▲The Cotton Harvest is Hopeless</p>
<p>Since the heavy rain began on the 6th of this month, accompanied by thunder and lightning, and the unusually cool weather, it has been two weeks. Floods have occurred in various villages, and the rice fields have been almost completely submerged, causing the people of the country to worry. And now, it is the height of summer (the hottest time of the year), but it is still cool and overcast. Late last night, around midnight, suddenly there were flashes of lightning and continuous thunder. In an instant, in the torrential rain, with two claps of thunder, all the lights in the city went out. The residents who were deep in sleep were all awakened by it. Later, although the raindrops were slightly smaller, the heavy rain continued to fall until morning. Yesterday, the rain did not stop all day, and the Fahrenheit temperature dropped to 64 degrees. Even wearing a jacket felt insufficient. The miserable situation in various places in the rain is summarized below.</p>
<p>▲Zhabei Various Places Have Become Lakes All the roads in Zhabei, such as Qiujiang Road, Yuyingtang Road, both sides of the Hanqiao North Pier, Datong Road Puaifang, and Xinhua Lane at the intersection of Jiaotong Road, have all been inundated, with water depths of about one foot in the houses, because the accumulated water cannot be drained in time. Even the customers buying and selling on both sides of the road and the residents have to use planks, etc. to cross the water. Other open areas such as the large open space east of the Maigen Road Station, the open space near the Sun Temple, in front of the Xijin Association, north of Gonghe Xin Road, and both north and south sides of Pushan Road, have all become lakes. Thousands of Jiangbei straw huts are submerged in water, and people can wash rice and vegetables inside the houses. In the evening, they set up beds on the surface of the water to sleep, so everyone is shouting in pain. What is called the hell on earth is probably no more than this.</p>
<p>▲The Temporary Levee of Zhangjia Weir Zhangjia Weir in the countryside near Xinlonghua in this city was suddenly washed away by rainwater. In an instant, the river water poured into the fields, creating a vast expanse of water. The farmers in the nearby villages also gathered together by beating gongs, rushed to fetch agricultural tools, and built a temporary levee overnight in the rain. They rushed to fill the breach with mud, soil, and stone chips. According to the villagers who came to Shanghai from the area yesterday, if the weather does not clear up, the temporary levee they built may be washed away again by heavy rain. Therefore, this work is done day and night, all in the rain.</p>
<p>▲Cotton in the Wusong Area is Hopeless Wusong has been experiencing heavy rain for days. Low-lying villages in the vicinity have turned into lakes, especially the Pao Tai Wan area, which is the worst. It is a vast expanse of water, and most of the straw huts are submerged in the water. The water level of the small rivers around China Public School continues to rise and increase, making drainage difficult, causing it to pour into the school's playground. All kinds of situations are a spectacle to behold. Generally, farmers say that due to excessive rainfall, although the rice fields are not yet affected, the cotton fields have suffered greatly. If the rain continues to fall, the harvest in the future may be hopeless, so everyone is very worried. Also, farmers in Yangxing and Liuxing townships in Baoshan County rely on cotton cultivation for a living. Yesterday, farmers from the area said that the cotton fields have already suffered a disaster, and there is little hope of recovery.</p>
<p>▲Houses Collapsing Everywhere Yesterday, a flat-roofed house at a certain number in Hongzhang Lane, Chuanshenhe Bridge in the city, collapsed at 5:00 p.m. due to years of disrepair and the soaking of continuous rainy days, which caused the foundation of the wall to loosen. Fortunately, it was in the daytime and no one was injured. Also, vendors at the entrance of Yuyuan and various roads and lanes stopped business and cried out in pain. The loss of general cold drink shops is even greater. The straw huts built by poor Jiangbei people in various places in western Shanghai have been washed down by rain everywhere in recent days. Even those that have not collapsed are full of water, and the sound of crying is miserable. It is also often heard that old houses and thatched houses inhabited by farmers in various villages have been washed down and damaged.</p>
<h3>Chen Gongzhe's Case of Seducing a Young Girl</h3>
<p>▲Under the Pretext of Discussing Studies</p>
<p>▲Enticing the Girl into a Hotel for a Secret Meeting</p>
<p>▲Huang Jianzhen's Tears Flowed Freely</p>
<p>▲Chen Gongzhe Failed to Appear in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Chen Gongzhe, the Chief of General Affairs Section of the Ministry of Railways of the National Government, is a native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, and is currently 44 years old. Recently, Huang Jianchi, a native of Panyu County, Guangdong Province, residing at No. 286, Shouchun Lane, Miller Road, Hongkou, representing his father Huang Runyou, engaged lawyer Shi Zhuoren to file a criminal complaint with the Special District Court against Chen for seducing his younger sister Huang Jianzhen, etc. The situation has been reported in newspapers. Yesterday morning, this case was heard in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Ge Zhiqin. The plaintiff, Huang Jianchi, his father, Huang Runyou, and the victim, Huang Jianzhen, all arrived in court on time with their agent, lawyer Shi. The defendant, Chen Gongzhe, did not appear. Chen's mother, Zhao, appointed lawyer Huang Yuping to appear in court and request a postponement. The main points of the indictment and the trial proceedings are excerpted below.</p>
<p>▲Main Points of the Indictment</p>
<p>The original complaint roughly stated: "Seducing a woman under the age of twenty to leave the person with parental rights, continuous rape, and an incidental private prosecution, ordering compensation for losses. My younger sister, Huang Jianzhen, is currently eighteen years old. In the first month of this year's lunar calendar, she met the defendant at the home of a friend, Mai Miaojuan, and they exchanged affectionate words and began to associate with each other. However, my family is not wealthy, and Jianzhen's education was intermittent. At that time, Jianzhen had dropped out of school. The defendant, knowing this, took the opportunity to entice Jianzhen, claiming that he was willing to find a school for her and lend her money. On March 1st of the same year, Jianzhen suffered from a toothache, and the defendant introduced her to Dr. Xu Junmin for treatment. On the 11th, he arranged for Jianzhen to meet him at Dr. Xu's office. The defendant made various advances and on April 12th, the defendant sent a letter, using the excuse of discussing Jianzhen's studies, to deceive her into going to the Nanjing Central Hotel, where she was raped four times in a row. He also said that his household lacked a hostess and that he wanted to marry her. Later, Jianzhen learned that the defendant was already married and realized she had been deceived. When she argued with him, he ignored her. When my mother learned of this, she was so angry that she committed suicide by hanging herself. By such actions, the defendant has violated Article 257, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, we file this lawsuit and demand that the defendant pay Jianzhen 10,000 yuan for maintenance and 10,000 yuan for consolation."</p>
<p>▲Trial Proceedings</p>
<p>At 10:15 yesterday morning, after Judge Ge took the bench, the defendant's agent, lawyer Huang Yuping, first stated that the defendant had gone to Nanyang two months ago due to business and would not be able to return to the country for several months. He requested a postponement of the trial. Regarding the legal and factual aspects of this case, he reserved all his rights to defend. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer, Shi Zhuoren, stated that when his lawyer wrote to the defendant last time, the defendant was still in Shanghai. Now, he is intentionally absent. He did not object to the defendant's lawyer's request for a postponement, but requested that the date be changed to seven days later to clarify whether the defendant was in Shanghai. He also submitted all the evidence and letters. Huang Jianchi also stated that he worked at the wheel office of the Toyo Trading Company Wharf. Jianzhen is my younger sister, and my father's name is Huang Runyou. He is now old, so I am filing the lawsuit on his behalf. Huang Runyou testified that he was 67 years old and unable to answer the judge's questions because he was from Guangdong and did not understand the Shanghai dialect, and he was hard of hearing. His face was covered with a white beard, so he could not understand what he heard. Then, Huang Jianzhen was called into the witness box. Jianzhen was wearing a gray cloth cheongsam, white socks, and leather shoes, her eyebrows furrowed in sadness, and tears streaming down her face. She looked very pitiful. Judge Ge asked her age, and she replied, "Eighteen." He asked, "Are you studying?" She replied, "I am not studying now." He asked, "Did Chen Gongzhe send you the letter?" She replied, "Yes." He asked, "When did you meet Chen?" She replied, "I met him at Mai's house in the first month." He asked, "On what day did you go to Nanjing and have physical relations?" She replied, "April 14th, at the Central Hotel." At this point, Judge Ge announced that the case would be postponed to August 1st and the defendant would be summoned to court for further verification. He also instructed the plaintiff to bring an interpreter familiar with the Shanghai dialect to the next court hearing to avoid language barriers, as the plaintiff was not proficient in the Shanghai dialect. After the announcement, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Further Hearing on the Case of Purchasing Military Firearm While Posing as a National Government Military Officer</h3>
<p>▲Bick Secretly Reported to Customs</p>
<p>▲Court Investigating Based on This Point</p>
<p>The Russian, Bick, and Leviasky, for forging the seal of Lai Fa Foreign Firm, and impersonating National Government military officers to order military firearm, were detained by the police and brought to the Special District Court. Several hearings have been held, details of which have been published in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Court President Xu Jiayi and Prosecutor Qian Hongye took the bench at the First Criminal Court for further questioning. The police were still represented by lawyer Ru Baoyi. The court appointed interpreter Jiang Baoliang to translate. Court President Xu first questioned Leviasky, who stated that he had previously commissioned Mei Tai Printing House to print cards. One morning, he went to pick them up and met Lai Fa on the way. Lai Fa asked why he had taken the contract and urged him to return it. Because it was inconvenient to argue on the road, he agreed to return it the next day. Lai Fa then asked him to pick up the cards, so he went to Mei Tai, but the owner, He Zixiang, was not there, so he did not get them. However, he saw a hundred copies of the contract that Lai Fa had asked the printing house to print. Seeing that it was related to military firearm, he copied one copy. At 4:00 in the afternoon, he went again, and He Zixiang told him that the cards had been sent to Lai Fa and gave him a copy of the contract, asking him to take it to Lai Fa. He then tore up the copy he had made. Unexpectedly, he was arrested at that time. Moreover, Mei Tai was an old customer of Lai Fa. If he wanted to forge Lai Fa's seal, he would not have asked Mei Tai to make it. Court President Xu then asked He Zixiang about Leviasky's commission to print cards, and then questioned Leviasky, "Did Lai Fa send a letter to Zhang Faying?" He replied, "On the 9th, Lai Fa sent it to Zhang Faying." He asked, "Does the letter say that if you fulfill all the conditions, you will ask Zhu Ziyao and two others to be witnesses?" He replied, "Not Zhang Faying. At that time, because Lai Fa only had one witness, Carlo, and no guarantor, he was angry and refused to sign the contract. Lai Fa then asked Zhu Ziyao to be the guarantor and promised to give him 200 yuan. He then added the word 'guarantor' before the witnesses on the contract, and the names were also added at the same time." The court then summoned Zhu Ziyao, but Zhu did not arrive. He then questioned Lai Fa, "Is what Leviasky said correct?" He replied, "The content of the letter said that if the Nanjing government could approve this matter, he would find two people to be guarantors. But in my opinion, why didn't Zhang Faying submit this letter, but the defendant did? This shows that Zhang never received this letter, so the seal on the contract must have been forged by the defendant." Court President Xu verified the testimony and then declared that the court had inquired with the Jianghai Customs Supervision Office whether Bick had reported Lai Fa's sale of military firearm to Guangdong, but had not yet received a reply. He has now sent a letter urging them to reply. Once the reply arrives, the court will set a date for further questioning. This case will be heard and verified again.</p>
<h3>Local Court Destroys Narcotics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court presented a report to the Jiangsu High Court regarding the destruction of the narcotics confiscated in the first half of the 20th year of the Republic, and it was decided to be held on the morning of July 25th. Yesterday was the scheduled date. Representatives from various organizations came to supervise, including Yu Zongjian from the High Court, Xiong Huihua and Chen Jingzhai from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, Huang Chang from the Municipal Government, Lin Woping from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Ju Zhijing from the Special District Local Court, Lu Youchang from the Customs, Chen Jiannan from the Shanghai County Party Department, Fan Ander from the Anti-Drug Association, and the Second District General Office, which sent patrol officer Niu Yulin and several police officers to the site to protect the area. Chief Prosecutor Liu sent Prosecutor Zhao Zikui and a clerk to verify and explain each item. At around 10:00, they ordered police chief Xu Jinqing, police sergeants Chen Xihui and Chen Junfang, etc., to supervise the police to pile the narcotics on the open ground, using pine wood, kerosene, and salt to burn them. Because of the heavy rain yesterday, it took until 2:00 in the afternoon to complete the destruction. The ashes were then packed in sacks and ordered to be sunk to the bottom of the Huangpu River to eliminate the toxic fumes. A total of 5,656 items of narcotics were destroyed this time, including opium, morphine, red pills, and smoking paraphernalia, etc., including more than ten sacks of two wooden boxes.</p>
<h3>16,000 Yuan Robbed from the General Trading Trust Company</h3>
<p>▲Five Robbers Robbed with Four Guns</p>
<p>▲Police Arrived, but the Robbers Had Already Fled</p>
<p>The General Trading Trust Company at No. 521, Yuxing Lane, Fujian Road, was invaded by five robbers around 8:30 last night. Four of them were armed with guns. At this time, the staff had already rested and gone out, so there were not many people in the office. After the robbers entered the room, they opened boxes and drawers and searched frantically for a long time. Finally, they seized 16,000 yuan in cash and fled. The police were notified and sent officers to investigate, but the robbers had already fled. The General Trading Trust Company also operates a banking business. Yuxing Lane, where it is located, connects to Nanjing Road in the north and Daxin Street in the west, so the robbers could easily change their route. The Old Gate Police Station has already started investigating this case. Most of the stolen banknotes were from the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Stops Issuing Merchant Ship Licenses</h3>
<p>▲Exemption from Registration Fees for Small Boats</p>

Now that the Jianghai Customs has been abolished, all types of ships are inspected and registered by this city, numbered, and pay monthly dues. It is hereby announced that merchant ship licenses will be discontinued and fees for small boat registration will be waived from August 1st of this year to show consideration. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Government and ordering the Dongjiadu Ship Dues Office of this bureau to comply, this notice is hereby issued for the information of all boat owners. A special announcement."</p>

(3) The number of leprosy patients seeking treatment in the Shanghai First District is increasing day by day. The existing Hongkou Skin Disease Hospital is no longer sufficient. It was decided to raise 50,000 yuan between November and December of this year to build a large-scale clinic in Shanghai for relief.</p>
<h3>Unclaimed Opium at the North Railway Station</h3>
<p>Recently, the opium ban in the inland areas has been extremely strict. General opium dealers often put opium in wooden boxes, disguised as other goods, and transported them to the inland areas for sale. Yesterday, a large wooden box was found in the baggage room of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway North Railway Station. After inspection by military police, the box was opened, and it was full of opium and red pills and other prohibited items. The packages were marked with the words "Hu receive Zhang receive" and other words. The opium dealers took the opportunity to escape. The opium and other items were immediately seized, weighing more than 300 catties, a total of more than 5,000 taels. After searching for the person transporting the opium without success, the prohibited items were sent to the local court for confiscation and destruction.</p>
<h3>Woman Sues for Divorce and Demands 26 Years of Alimony</h3>
<p>▲Totaling 28,080 Yuan</p>
<p>A woman, Zhang Sun, recently engaged two lawyers, Wu Chengyu and others, to file a complaint with the Special District Court, accusing her husband, Zhang Zhixiang (of Juntaibao Customs Brokerage, Gongshun Lane, Guangdong Road), of abuse, neglect of maintenance, and forcing her to sign a separation agreement. She requested that a divorce be granted and that she be paid alimony for 26 years, at 90 yuan per month, totaling 28,080 yuan. Furthermore, due to extreme poverty, she was unable to pay the litigation fees and requested assistance in litigation in accordance with Article 130 of the Civil Procedure Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenyong of the Special Court opened the Seventh Civil Court for questioning. The defendant engaged lawyer Gu Ren to defend him. Judge Xu first asked the plaintiff's agent, lawyer Wu, why the plaintiff had not paid the litigation fees. Lawyer Wu replied that the divorce should be resolved first in accordance with the law, and then the litigation fees should be paid. Judge Xu said, "How can the proceedings proceed if the litigation fees are not paid? Furthermore, the plaintiff's address is unknown, and the court cannot investigate the plaintiff's economic situation." Lawyer Wu replied that Sun had no ability to pay the litigation fees after being expelled. She is currently living with her sister in the French Concession. Then, the defendant's agent, lawyer Gu Ren, stated that the plaintiff in this case was the defendant's concubine, not his legal wife. They had been cohabiting for ten years and had one child each, a son, Huchen, nine years old, and a daughter, Peilan, three years old. He heard that on the fourth day of the lunar month, the plaintiff was having an affair with a man named Xu in the room while the defendant was away. Because it had been going on for a long time, Zhang broke in and caught the two lovers. Zhang then called the police and arrested the pair, intending to send them to the authorities for investigation. After she begged bitterly, she agreed to separate unconditionally. Zhang also agreed because the family scandal should not be publicized. The next day, his lawyer drafted a separation agreement, which she sealed with her fingerprint. At that time, the defendant gave her 225 yuan in cash and clothing worth 2,000 yuan. Now, she suddenly makes this fuss, which is obviously unreasonable. Moreover, the plaintiff has already received the aforementioned property and hired two lawyers. How can she say that she is unable to pay the litigation fees? It is contrary to both law and reason. He requested that the court reject the plaintiff's complaint. However, Zhang Sun and her lawyer both denied receiving the defendant's property. Judge Xu then announced that the case would be verified again after a written ruling on the request for assistance was made.</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Bandit Suppression Command Transfers Bandit Leader Dong Zhengren</h3>
<p>Dong Zhengren, a famous bandit leader in Zhenjiang (nickname "Shouer Laba"), was arrested by detective Liu Longdai of the New Gate Police Station for extorting a large sum of money from his fellow villager Zhang Zhenglu. After the police chief found out that Dong was a major bandit in the inland areas, he ordered him to be detained pending investigation. Now, the Pacification Superintendent's Office has learned of this and immediately sent Deputy Commander Chen to Shanghai by car overnight with a document, requesting the police station to extradite him. The police chief agreed to send the major bandit to the court that day. Deputy Commander Chen will go to the court at the appointed time to apply for the transfer to his case.</p>

When she saw the remains, she cried out loudly, which was extremely tragic. All the Chinese and Western female guests in the hall were moved to tears. The coffin was placed in the main hall, and large and small wreaths were almost completely displayed. After the ceremony, due to the rain, the family members decided to temporarily place the coffin in the funeral home and move it to the Public Works Department Cemetery in Hongqiao for burial at a later date.</p>

<h3>Young Woman's Lawsuit Against Husband for Abandonment Dismissed</h3>
<p>Xu Qiuyue, a young woman, previously engaged lawyers Dong Yu and Chen Zhigao to file a criminal complaint in the French Court against Chen Jiongwen for abandonment, requesting the recovery of 120,000 yuan in living expenses. After the summons, the defendant did not appear. She was instructed to be summoned again for investigation, as reported in the newspapers. She was summoned again yesterday and first told the lawyers representing the plaintiff that the plaintiff married the defendant as a concubine in 1924. Not long after entering the family, the defendant's wife died. In 1927, the defendant remarried a Zhu as his successor. Unexpectedly, Zhu was naturally fierce and quarrelsome with the plaintiff. The defendant told the plaintiff that it was inevitable that wives and concubines would quarrel, so it would be better to come to Shanghai to rent a house to live in separately. At that time, the plaintiff believed him and came to Shanghai with him. Later, the defendant claimed that it was difficult to find a suitable house for the time being and temporarily lived in a hotel. Unexpectedly, the defendant returned to his hometown alone and never returned, moving away without a trace, abandoning the plaintiff. Now, it was only discovered that the defendant had a foreign goods store under his jurisdiction, so she filed a lawsuit requesting the recovery of living expenses, etc. The defendant, Chen Jiongwen, also defended through a lawyer, stating that the plaintiff's lawyer had omitted an important point. The plaintiff filed a report in your court in 1928, which was then mediated by lawyer Wang Chengji. The defendant paid the plaintiff 1,500 yuan as a settlement. There is a settlement agreement as proof. Since this case has already been settled, how can it be brought again? My client originally wanted to file a counterclaim, but considering that the plaintiff is a woman, he requests that she be severely reprimanded. The plaintiff acknowledged receiving 1,500 yuan, but hesitated about the rest. Judge Zhu reviewed the words and ruled in court that the plaintiff's accusation was untrue. Since this case has already been settled, how can it be brought again? The case should be dismissed immediately.</p>

<h3>Workers in Public Utilities May Not Stop Work on Any Holiday</h3>
<p>▲Joint Notice from the Municipal Public Utilities and Social Affairs Bureaus</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities and Social Affairs Bureaus issued a joint notice yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of issuing a joint notice, Article 19 of the Factory Law promulgated by the National Government on December 30th, 1929, states that 'Regarding the work of military and public utilities, the competent authorities may, when deemed necessary, stop the workers' holidays,' etc. Indeed, public utilities, including water, electricity, and transportation, are all related to the lives of the people and cannot be lacking for even a moment. Moreover, they are all related to local security and cannot be interrupted for even a moment. The government has the responsibility to protect the people and maintain local order, so it is necessary to stop the holidays of workers in public utilities factories. Although the law will not be implemented until August 1st of this year, Shanghai is a huge city in China with 3 million citizens, and the importance of public utilities is unmatched by other places. Historically, various holidays in the industrial and commercial sectors, in addition to certain mass movements or certain commemorative ceremonies, workers in municipal public utilities factories have mostly not participated in their entirety, and the people and the locality have been able to be safely protected. Therefore, this bureau and others, based on Article 19 of the Factory Law, jointly announce that all workers in various public utilities companies in the city will only be allowed to send representatives to participate in any mass movements or commemorative ceremonies in the future, and all other workers must continue to work as usual. Even on other holidays, they may not stop work. It is hoped that all workers in the public utilities companies will comply. This is announced."</p>

<h3>Zhu Qinglan Goes from Shaanxi to Gansu to Survey Disaster</h3>
<p>▲ Shaanxi Relief Completed</p>
<p>▲ Continuing to Gansu to Investigate the Disaster</p>
<p>Zhu Ziqiao, Standing Committee Member of the Relief Commission and Chairman of the North China Charitable Federation, came to Shanghai twice previously to organize a temporary emergency relief association for the Shaanxi disaster with representatives from various countries and philanthropists.  He raised over 431,000 yuan in donations, which were successively remitted to Shaanxi. He also took relief workers to various counties in Shaanxi to distribute aid. The disaster victims all benefited practically and sang his praises.  Now, because the Shaanxi relief is completed, Mr. Zhu is transferring to Gansu to investigate the disaster situation. The disaster in Gansu is severe, no less than in Shaanxi, but because it is located on the frontier, and transportation is far and difficult, there is suffering from the inability to provide relief. Even with relief funds, it is not easy to distribute them. Mr. Zhu, undeterred by hardship, resolutely went to provide aid. He telegraphed Chairman Ping Jingren of the Relief Commission and Mr. Wang Yiting, requesting them to raise funds to investigate and relieve the Gansu disaster, in order to save the people of Longxi who are on the verge of death.  He telegraphed again the day before yesterday, reporting that he had departed from Shaanxi for Gansu on the 22nd of this month. The two telegrams are recorded below: (1) To Chairman Xu, Elder Wang, and forwarded to Huang Hanzhi, Zhang Xianqing, Li Shoushan, Wu Zhihao, Li Zuzui, and all philanthropists: Because the disaster in Gansu is severe, I wanted to go and inspect. Yesterday, someone from eastern Long came and said that in the Zhenyuan area, there was no harvest of wheat, and there was also banditry. Hearing this, I felt saddened. The disaster in Longxi is even more severe. I plan to go there in person soon. Gentlemen, please practice the Bodhisattva path and raise generous relief funds to save the dying people of Gansu and Longxi. I earnestly pray. Zhu Qinglan, 30th. (2) To Chairman Xu of the Relief Commission, Elder Wang, and forwarded to Huang Hanzhi, Zhang Xianqing, Wu Zhihao, Li Zuzui, and all gentlemen, as well as all philanthropists: Yang Chen and I, along with relief colleagues, are going to Gansu to inspect the disaster situation. More details will follow. Zhu Qinglan.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Disaster Situation in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The Shanghai fundraising for Jiangxi emergency relief association has previously received telegrams from disaster investigators Wei Ruifeng, Wu Jiasan, and Ma Geng, reporting on everything. Now we have received a report as follows: (Above omitted) Keqiang and others were dispatched to Jiangxi and observed on the ship that along the Yangtze River, it was a vast expanse of water. Fields and houses were submerged in the water, and the disaster was already formed. When they arrived in Jiujiang, the city was flooded by the river, and the streets and alleys were filled with water, forming a waterlogged area. They immediately went to the Jiujiang Red Cross Branch to investigate the disaster situation, and met with Chairman Zhan Mingqiu, President Zhang Fengqi, and the hospital director of the Song Hospital. They discussed that the Jiangxi disaster was different from other provinces because Jiangxi Province was suffering from banditry, so the damage was more severe and relief was more difficult. For example, the Jingdezhen porcelain industry has no capital and all the laid-off workers are unemployed, and there is an urgent need to find ways to raise funds to establish a lending institution to provide relief. This is one aspect of the disaster situation investigated in Jiujiang. After arriving in Nanchang, they met Commander Xiong. Commander Xiong also knew very well that the gentlemen in Shanghai urgently wanted to understand the real situation of the Jiangxi disaster, so he immediately gave instructions and asked Keqiang to telegraph first to comfort the expectations of the great philanthropists in Shanghai. Now Nanchang has organized a local relief office, which is directly under the office of the Director of the Party and Government Committee of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Wen Qun. All Jiangxi disaster affairs are handled by this office. Keqiang and others are now assisting in the handling of affairs everywhere. The office has received telegrams from various places requesting relief and is in urgent need of finding ways to provide relief. A list of refugees requesting relief is enclosed, which shows the severity of the disaster situation in various places in the province, and so on. Now the association has already telegraphed 200,000 yuan for relief to Commander Xiong in Nanchang to handle at his discretion. (List of refugees requesting relief omitted)</p>
<h3>Mild Cholera Discovered in the City</h3>
<p>▲ Investigation by the Municipal Health Bureau</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor, Respectfully, after reading today's newspaper, I found that the Shanghai Women's Relief Association has quite a few criticisms of our association. Preventing problems before they arise is admirable, but the purpose of our association is purely to improve aesthetic concepts and has no malicious intent to insult women. Moreover, the holding of beauty pageants has many precedents in European and American countries. It is held every year, and tens of thousands of people flock to the streets. The grandeur is beyond words. The only goal of holding it is to enable its citizens to have a concept of beauty and to improve their physical fitness day by day. The purpose of holding this International Beauty Pageant is the same. Therefore, the women from various countries who joined have been strictly reviewed by various judges. Dastardly enchantresses hide at the sight of their shadows and have nowhere to stand. Moreover, there is no reason to force those who participate to wear bathrobes. If Chinese women join the competition, they will all wear beautiful Chinese clothes to compete for beauty. There is no distinction between high and low. Moreover, the total value of the gifts donated by major stores at sea is as high as 9,000 taels, which will be given to the elected Miss Shanghai. The preliminary and final elections will also be held in two phases. The judges are all well-known people at sea, who are impartial. The solemnity of the etiquette can be imagined. It is not comparable to a trivial matter. As for the International Bathing Beauty Contest, according to English, it was originally a mistake for the International Beauty Pageant. I am attaching this correction to avoid misunderstandings in all circles. I have always admired your newspaper's fair arguments. I hope that you will grant us the column of letters to the editor to make the truth known. I am infinitely grateful. Sincerely, The International Beauty Pageant, July 25.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>A New Weight Loss Method</p>
<p>Overweight people all hate their excess flesh and try every possible way to lose weight. Recently, a new weight loss method has been invented: playing the piano (Pianna) persistently. It is said to have unexpected effects. In Queensland, Australia, a person played the piano continuously for eighty-six hours and fifteen minutes, breaking all previous world records. During this time, his weight decreased by as much as thirteen pounds. If one could do this regularly, it seems it would not be difficult for a fat person to become thin. In addition, there is another method: getting very angry and flying into a rage can also reduce weight. However, family members will definitely find it a headache, and neighbors will inevitably protest.</p>
<p>The Haunted House in Liverpool</p>
<p>In Liverpool, England, there is a very beautiful house overlooking the Vale of Liangollen, with extremely beautiful scenery. Many young women from the Liverpool Women's Club Federation are now going there for summer vacation and staying there. However, this house has been known as a haunted house because, when it was built a hundred years ago, the owner, a very hygienic doctor, specially opened many holes in the walls to let air in. As a result, whenever there was a windy day, strong winds would blow in through the holes, sounding like ghosts crying. People nearby all referred to it as a haunted house. However, several years ago, all the holes were completely filled, and the sound disappeared. All so-called haunted houses in the world can be viewed in this way.</p>
<h3>What I Saw in Nanjing</h3>
<p>— UB</p>
<p>At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Nanjing had three "many's": many bedbugs, many secret prostitutes, and many candidates for official positions. After the Republic of China, there were also three "not's": dim electric lights, unreliable telephones, and uneven roads. These are all accurate criticisms.</p>
<p>Since Nanjing became the capital, its external appearance has greatly changed. Electric lights are bright, telephones are automatic, and roads are wide. As for the abundance of bedbugs, it is known throughout the world. The famous Nanjing bug cannot be eradicated overnight. The abundance of secret prostitutes has developed in inverse proportion to the suppression of open prostitution. This is not easy to fundamentally eliminate until the problem of people's livelihood is completely solved. However, candidates for official positions have of course disappeared. Now, it should be said that there are many officials and many belts. If we stop briefly at a playground or movie theater, we can see people wearing badges and belts everywhere.</p>
<p>Ryūnosuke Akutagawa wrote "The Christ of Nanjing." Western missionaries who traveled to Nanjing often wrote descriptions of Nanjing people. Foreigners' impressions of Nanjing people are almost entirely of ferocious, terrible, treacherous, and despicable characters.</p>
<p>Last year, a Christian missionary wrote a reflection after traveling to Nanjing. Some of his words are realistic. He said that Nanjing is a nouveau riche. Even rickshaw pullers have a barbaric and arrogant attitude. The fare is at least twenty silver cents. If you offer less, they turn their heads and ignore you, or give you a cold and mocking look.</p>
<p>The cost of the three necessities of life—clothing, food, and housing—has increased year by year. The cost of living in 1930 was double that of 1926, twice as expensive as in 1919-1920, and three times as expensive as in 1912-1913. Compared with the end of the Qing Dynasty, it has increased at least tenfold.</p>
<p>Currently, the minimum wage for a female servant in Nanjing is six yuan per month. Ten years ago, one could hire one for only one-sixth of that amount. They demand bonuses during festivals, and taking a cut of the money for buying groceries is a matter of course.</p>
<p>When you go to the street to buy something, you often encounter opportunities for price gouging. For example, if you use silver dimes to buy something, each dime is only counted as nine fen of a silver dollar. But if you want to give him a silver dollar and get change, he will tell you that each silver dime is worth nine fen and three li according to the market price. For example, if you buy something worth five dimes, he will give you five small silver coins and ten copper coins as change. But if you want to give him dimes, you must give him five small silver coins and fifteen copper coins. Such contradictions exist. The commercial morality of Nanjing people can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Zhengting's Hobbies</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting celebrated his fiftieth birthday yesterday. His friends and colleagues planned to raise money to celebrate his birthday, but Mr. Wang politely declined. He then went to Hangzhou with his wife and son, and then to Mogan Mountain to avoid the birthday celebrations. At a time of natural disasters, man-made disasters, internal troubles, and external threats, Mr. Wang can understand the difficulties of the times and eliminate bad customs. He can be called a wise and outstanding person. According to a certain gentleman, several things he likes to do in his life are recorded here to confirm this talk.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is good at drinking, especially Shaoxing wine. Cigars are also never far from his mouth. He is a very eloquent speaker. After a few drinks, his arguments flow endlessly, combining seriousness and humor, like wind rising and clouds forming. Those who listen are convinced. He is skilled in equestrianism. In the past, he would gallop in the countryside as his morning exercise. Recently, due to busy official duties, he has not done this for a long time. However, during his spare time, he often plays tennis, billiards, and golf with his friends. Although Mr. Wang holds important positions and is constrained by public and private affairs, he has no spare time. But his physique is strong and his spirit is full, which is largely due to outdoor exercise.</p>
<h3>The Alarming Japanese Quest for Commercial Information in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>The intensity of the Japanese people's desire for knowledge is as fervent as a young man pursuing the opposite sex. They seek knowledge of the Northeast, both large and small, with diligent pursuit and thorough research. Naturally, this harbors a single-minded love of treating the Northeast as their "meat on the chopping board". Look! Korea, a colony under Japanese protection, suddenly and violently rejects Chinese. This is the starting point for the Japanese's planned and orderly, single-minded love of plotting against China. If the Chinese people continue to engage in internal strife and fail to resist foreign aggression, then won't the Japanese people's long-cherished dream of the Northeast become a reality of this saying: "Where there's a will, there's a way"? The Japanese not only have the desire to swallow the Northeast, but also the evil intention of encompassing the Yangtze River. Further, they will not stop until they sweep through all of China. One can understand their conspiracy by observing the actions of the Japanese in Shanghai. Originally, the Japanese commercial organizations in Shanghai employed several Chinese people to investigate various Chinese shops: how much capital, how many shareholders, what their names are, how much revenue each year, and whether there are profits or losses; which goods are popular with which gangs, and which port sells the most of which goods. These Chinese employees have been running around all day long for more than ten years (the years of work that I know). Until now, they are still working hard without stopping. All these reports, after being sorted by the Japanese, are classified and made into tables, serving as military maps for their commercial warfare, directly delivering production to dumping sites. In this way, Chinese merchants who sell goods, due to the convenience of procedures and lower costs, naturally become the front-line shock troops of the Japanese commercial warfare. Isn't the Japanese commercial victory "as sure as having the deed in hand"? After the victory, they will probably perform the same play they put on in Korea, "driving the incense burners out of the monks," once again in mainland China. Someone said to me, "You are too worried, because this is commercialization and has nothing to do with the Japanese military." I said, "Humph. Don't be confused. They are of one mind and one heart, with the top calling and the bottom responding, standing on the same battle line to plot against us. Unlike us, who are scattered, superficial, and adhere to the ancient motto of 'each sweeping the snow from their own doorstep,' a nation without awareness or progress."</p>
<h3>Chain of Happiness</h3>
<p>— Xiao Die</p>
<p>Recently, I have repeatedly received letters from friends with a "chain of happiness," which says, "This chain can bring the best blessings and luck to people. Forward it to each other and do not interrupt it, otherwise bad luck will come immediately. This chain was invented by a US Army colonel. His intention is to make this chain circle the earth three times, and it will be miraculously effective. Copy this chain into nine copies and send them to nine good friends whom you want to bring luck to. Within nine days of sending it out, the sender will surely have very pleasant and satisfying things happen. It has been tested repeatedly and is effective, otherwise bad luck will come immediately." (Below, it lists many examples of people who gained wealth by sending the chain and lost wealth by stopping it.) This letter is often seen in the homes of relatives and friends, and it has spread all over the country. The greatness of its spread can be imagined. I dare not hope for undeserved good luck, so I have not forwarded it, and bad luck has not yet come. I only think deeply about what the inventor of this chain intends. Although it is a childish game, the speed and greatness of its spread is so rapid that if it were used for disaster relief and charity, millions of dollars could be raised in an instant. The method of nine-person chaining is to transform one into ten, ten into a hundred, a hundred into a thousand, and a thousand into ten thousand. If this chain is expanded only ten times, the number will reach one hundred million. If each person who sends a letter asks the recipient to donate one wen to a designated place and copy this letter to send to nine people, and then repeat this process, then one hundred million wen can be obtained within one hundred days, equivalent to thirty million silver dollars. When floods, droughts, and bandit disasters are rampant throughout the country, and disaster relief is lacking, why don't those who have a heart abandon useless games and pay attention to this? As long as there are ten like-minded people, making an appeal from a high place, great results can be achieved within a month.</p>
<h3>The Strange Old Man Who Sleeps in a Coffin</h3>
<p>— Master of Qifeng Tower</p>
<p>There is an old man in a certain village in Jiangyin who is from a well-off family, but he is eccentric by nature. He placed a coffin in front of his bedroom. At dusk, he would curl up and sleep in it, using it as a bed, while the bed and curtains in the room were left unused. One night, a guest, Mr. Jia, lost his way and came to his door seeking shelter. The family did not dare to respond, but Mr. Jia pleaded urgently because it was late at night and he had nowhere to stay. So they felt pity and told him, "There is indeed a spare bed in the back room, but there is a coffin in front of the bed, and strange things often happen at night. If you are brave, you can sleep there." Mr. Jia had no choice but to enter the room, read the Book of Changes by the lamp, and then lie down to sleep behind the curtain. At midnight, there was a rustling sound from the coffin. Mr. Jia held his breath and watched the strange thing from behind the curtain. After a while, an old man with a long beard lifted the coffin lid and walked to the bed, flipping through the Book of Changes and reading it. After reading it, he returned to his original place. Mr. Jia was even more horrified, but he dared not make a sound. At dawn, Mr. Jia got up to leave. Suddenly, someone came up behind him and said, "Why don't you eat your fill before you leave?" Mr. Jia looked back and was shocked and wanted to run away, because it was the person who had appeared in the coffin the night before. Then the old man explained the reason in detail, saying that the coffin lid was covered with black gauze, so it was convenient to open and use. They both smiled. This humble person says, "Now there are many thieves. Those who have wealth and cannot sleep peacefully at night may as well imitate the old man's trick to ensure safety." Just a laugh.</p>
<h3>Travels in India (69)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the second day, I went to Sarnath (i.e., Deer Park) again to climb a pagoda. There are three pagodas here. One is in the north, a conical brick pagoda, which cannot be climbed. The second is a pointed pagoda in the west, which is also difficult to climb. The third is a two-story pagoda in the southwest, not far from the Museum of Antiquities. Only this pagoda can be climbed. The pagoda is next to the main road, shaded by beautiful trees. There are houses nearby. I placed my bicycle next to the well and went west to climb this pagoda. There is a sign next to it, which says in English, "Chankhandhi Stuptu," which is the name of the pagoda. These signs are all made by the Mahayana Buddhist Society. There is a cave under the pagoda, which can also be entered, but I did not have time to enter due to the accumulation of broken bricks. Climbing to the second floor, I reached the top, which is about four or five zhang high. But in the open wilderness, you can see everything. You can only see the sky and clouds connected, and the dense forests of trees, interspersed with houses and wheat fields. Looking south to Varanasi, you can see chimneys. The east, west, and north are all open wilderness. Originally, Hindu temples rarely have large pagodas like those in China. There are also very few pagodas. Chinese pagodas are better than Indian pagodas. This pagoda is the birthplace of the Dharma of the Buddha's Great Enlightenment. So I wrote four lines of poetry on the north gate of the pagoda. Because I did not have a writing brush, I wrote it with a fountain pen, so the words are only barely recognizable. If a Chinese person comes, they can recognize it. The poem says, "The Dharma of the Great Enlightenment originated from the five bhikkhus. The Buddha's traces in Deer Park remain to this day. The beautiful birds and trees should be as they were yesterday. Clouds rise underfoot in the five continents."</p>
<p>The straight line of the top of the pagoda can be four steps. If Chinese people come to study here in the future, they can build another floor to expand it, which would be a good place to rest. I heard that the five bhikkhus lived here in the past. It has been more than two thousand years, so it can be called an ancient dormitory. I talked to the Dharma master at the university, who said that the pointed pagoda in the middle is where the Buddha first preached the Dharma. Also, many temple sites were built by King Ashoka and later kings. They have been destroyed for two thousand years, and no one cares about them. However, the bricks are still mostly intact. How solid are the projects of the ancients! I asked if there are still monks in India. He replied that there are monks in the country of Chilagon in the province of Bengal near Calcutta. Because the Buddha was originally from Kapilavastu, which belongs to this country. According to students, there are still one million people in that country today, and there may be one hundred Buddhist monks. The train can go there, and it is only two hundred miles from Calcutta. I asked how the Mahayana and Hinayana schools are divided. According to him, there was a general assembly after the Buddha's death. Two hundred years later, during the reign of King Ashoka, there was another general assembly. At that time, the Sthavira school led a group of disciples to assemble, and they became the Hinayana school. The younger ones combined and became the Mahayana school. Originally, the original name of the Hinayana school meant the school of elders, which can be proven. As for the differences in their doctrines, the Sthavira school adheres to pure cultivation and does not mix it with expedient methods. If the Mahayana school develops into multiple gods and harmonizes with Hinduism, it is an expedient method. Such are the differences between the two schools. I then returned to the Indian school. The setting sun was setting, and the cattle and sheep were returning home. The fallen leaves were falling, as if telling me that all Dharma sounds are impermanent. On the way, I passed a Christian church and met several English ladies and an Indian female missionary. They told me several passages from the Bible that can prove that women manage the world and can eliminate soldiers. Then I returned.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>The ancients said: "A moment of spring night is worth a thousand pieces of gold, isn't a summer night worth half a cent?"</p>
<p>Ziliang did not speak, and lay down on the bed. His wife also followed and went up. Ziliang made way to the inside of the bed. Suddenly, he felt something high under his body. He reached out to touch it and his hand was all wet. Not good! What is it? He took it out and saw that it was a big piece of cream cake, half stuck to Ziliang's short shirt, and half still on the mattress.</p>
<p>This was what his wife had left by her pillow to eat, and somehow it got underneath. At that moment, when his wife saw it, she clapped her hands and laughed. Ziliang had to take off his short shirt and use it to wipe the mattress. His wife did not come to help him.</p>
<p>It was wiped clean! Ziliang then lay down again. When his wife saw that Ziliang did not say a word, she nagged and talked endlessly. Ziliang did not listen to her, and thought to himself:</p>
<p>"I originally wanted to use today's holiday to finish correcting the students' essays, more than one hundred and sixty books. But I was bothered by her, and I didn't get any work done. My mind was confused, and my body was tired. How could I write? Alas, I don't have another Sunday like this before the summer vacation. This beautiful demon, she really doesn't understand that I have important work to do. She is bothering me as a kind of duty, as a kind of fun. Alas!</p>

<h3>Gold and Financial Markets Continue to Show Promising Trends</h3>
<p>▲ Gold Prices Rose Six Taels Midday: Yesterday, the 25th, the posted gold price continued to rise and remained strong. There was a slight back and forth, but the situation was still stable. The trading margin was only two or three taels. As a result, it rose six taels. Transaction activity was higher than supply. The morning market immediately showed an advantage, which was not unusual given the slight increase in silver prices. It was inquired that the European market was normal and U.S. stocks fell. Because the German debt conference was not very optimistic, people were bullish, so the market opened high. It then weakened slightly, fluctuating around 744 taels. However, foreign exchange seemed good. The same industry purchased. Afterwards, it was suddenly heard that Mumbai was selling silver blocks. It rushed forward and large households competed to purchase. It quickly reached 50 taels. However, this price was not easy to sell. As the number of sellers increased, it weakened slightly. The market was closing for the week on Saturday. Remembering that this week, the market had almost become a spiral, with a high of 55 taels 2 mace, but no possibility of continuing to rise. It saw a low of 32 taels. In total, it only rose 2 taels 5 mace, etc.</p>

Dalian Gang and Dadecheng, etc., bought in, and it rose more than 2 taels, and was favorable. Shanghai sold English gold to Zhejiang in September for 1875, reaching 5 taels 7 or 8 mace at 10 o'clock. Afterwards, because U.S. and Japanese commercial banks paired to do current period 1875, and the foreign telegraph sold U.S. dollars at 30 yuan 0.075, the gold price fell back 2 taels. Qian Changxiang, Yuan Maoyong, etc., all sold off, reaching around 44 taels at 10:20. Afterwards, English gold could be settled at 1875, and U.S. dollars were slightly favorable. On the trading floor, buyers seemed strong, and it rose to between 45 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Once Reached 50 Taels: Suddenly, the news that Mumbai was selling silver greatly boosted confidence. Bingxing, Daxingyong, Yu Da, Hengxingyuan, Runchangxiang, speculator Lu, etc., purchased in confusion. For a while, the atmosphere was good. It continued to rise by 4 or 5 mace, and the English gold was only settled at 1.25, reaching 50 taels at 11:00. Wanxing, Yuan Maoyong, Shunli, Hengyu, Yuancheng, etc., came to sell, so it was difficult to maintain and immediately decreased sharply by more than 2 taels, to 47 taels 8 mace. In an instant, it pulled up more than 2 taels, to 9 taels 8 mace. Xinhang, etc., bought in. Ten minutes later, it fell by more than 1 tael 5 or 6 mace, to 8 taels 2 or 3 mace. It was heard that the Indian exchange rate was small by 2 annas, and it rose by about 2 taels. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 49 taels 5 mace, an increase of 6 taels compared to the day before. Because Hengyu, Fuchang, etc., sold off, it rose back to 46 or 47 taels after closing, but there was no important news. This is just the fluctuation of confidence. The maximum midday was 50 taels and the minimum was 43 taels, a difference of 7 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Uncoined Silver Increased by 10 Taels: Wupin opened at 4 taels 8 mace and closed at 9 taels. The listed price was changed to 792 taels 6 mace, an increase of 50 taels.</p>
<p>It reached 43 or 44 taels, registered at 48 to 50 taels, supplemented water at 48 taels. The spot price for uncoined silver was slightly soft, and it increased by 10 taels. There were few transactions, and Yingfengheng, etc., had slight ins and outs.</p>

Qian Changxiang, Yuanchun, Daxingyong, Yuanxingyong, Tianxiang, Dakang, Yu Da, and Fuchang had ins and outs from time to time. Wupin went in and out suddenly, which was speculative. The Guangdong Gang still did not move. The Dalian Gang went out 2,000 and in 1,000.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Internal Market Showed Favorable Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and Jin markets all reported increases, but the market was still stable. The United States was still in a wait-and-see mode. The British-American exchange rate also rose. Therefore, the Shanghai market was not affected. HSBC's listed price only added two yuan to the French franc, and the Japanese exchange rate returned a small 0.25, totaling 1 tael 6 mace 4 fen 5. There were no other changes. The bank's internal market seemed favorable, but the trading margin was very small. The gold market continued to show good conditions, so the midday closing compared to the night before was a decrease of 0.0625 in British gold, an increase of 0.125 in British gold, and an increase of 0.01 in the Japanese exchange rate. It was a different trend of external reduction and internal increase. Chinese merchants such as Chengfengyong, Fuchang, and Dalian Gang, etc., had slight connections. Only a small amount of English gold, totaling about 100,000 pounds, was traded, including tens of thousands of pounds of mutual trading between the banks. Also, U.S. dollars were paired by U.S. and Japanese merchants at 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Also, a telegram from Manila sold the current period. As for the Dong exchange, there were few ins and outs. Because it was the weekend in the afternoon, there was no market.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange: The internal market only fluctuated by 0.0625. The morning bid price was 1 shilling 3 pence 0.125 to 0.1875, and the buying price was 0.1875 to 0.25, and there were no transactions. At 10 o'clock, the market was stable. It was favorable.

<h3>The Li-Chai Market Was Silent and Odorless</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview: Yesterday was Saturday. Banks had no afternoon business. In the financial sector, this summer was bleak, and the weekend holiday made it even quieter than usual. In terms of Qian Zhuang, the market transaction was slightly less than usual. Market prices were mostly peaceful, but copper coins felt slightly longer.</p>

<h3>Securities Market: Bond Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bond futures market was calm, with sluggish trading, fluctuating without major ups or downs. Although there were no significant changes in the overall bond market environment, the Northern Stone Army rebellion, the unresolved situation in Guangdong, and the unfinished anti-communist campaign inevitably weakened market sentiment. Investment inflows were not as enthusiastic as before, while some investors continued to sell off small amounts of spot goods. This explains the gradual decline in bond prices in recent days. Although the fluctuations were minor yesterday, the market continued its gradual downward trend, resulting in a slight decrease of one or two jiao to about half a yuan compared to the previous day. The total futures trading volume was over 14.48 million yuan, while there were no spot transactions in either the morning or afternoon sessions.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Temporarily Returns to Calm</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, with concerns about a downward trend. This is due to the consistently declining conditions of overseas cotton yarn, yet the delivery of goods remains tight. In addition, local yarn prices are relatively high, making it difficult for prices to fall significantly at the opening. Balancing these factors, many anticipate that the domestic floods will weaken farmers' purchasing power, significantly impacting actual sales. Therefore, there are still quite a few sellers.</p>
<p>▲Loose Atmosphere in the Open Market: The open market at the exchange started with a flat trend. Due to the significant drop in foreign cotton, the market atmosphere was loose, with prices for all months falling by one, two, or three qian. The afternoon session remained flat, with a slight decrease of one qian for all months. The total trading volume was 28,850 bales. Purchases included 1,250 bales by Taixing, 600 bales by Hengde, 700 bales by Yichang, and 950 bales by Tongyu. Sales included 650 bales by Dafu, 2,300 bales by Guangfeng, 1,100 bales by Changfeng, 1,150 bales by Yuda, and 800 bales by Jifeng. The closing prices for the open market are recorded below:</p>
<p>Open Market Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Inventory Account: Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Inventory Account</p>
<p>July 163.9, Up 2, 204,000 October 163.9, Down 1, 74,750</p>
<p>August 164.8, 77,450 November 164.2, Down 3, 81,950</p>
<p>September 162.7, Down 3, 98,200 December 165.0, Up 3, 69,950</p>
<p>Brokerage purchases totaled 1,800 bales, inter-dealer trades totaled 200 bales, and the market was flat. Customer brokerage included 525 bales from inland areas, 325 bales from Hankou, 145 bales from Shantou, 350 bales from Guangdong, 125 bales from Yunnan, 75 bales from Qingdao, 75 bales from Sichuan, and 115 bales from miscellaneous sources.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market: No Major Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The decline in American cotton prices has intensified, and Indian cotton is following suit, inevitably weakening market sentiment. However, the continuous rain has caused widespread domestic flooding, significantly damaging cotton fields. Consequently, inland brokers are sending telegrams to purchase cotton. Meanwhile, local fire-powered mills are selling off large quantities due to the relatively high prices, putting pressure on the market. The afternoon session saw a decline as a result.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Cotton Market: Fire-Powered Mills Selling Off: The open market for Hankou cotton at the exchange initially had the potential for a sharp increase. However, due to the poor performance of foreign cotton, market sentiment softened, with prices for all months rising by one or two qian. The closing price retreated by one qian. The afternoon session declined due to fire-powered mills selling off. The closing price slightly increased as the rain continued. Overall, the price decreased by five fen. The total trading volume was 98,600 dan. Sales included 5,600 dan by Xinheng, 2,800 dan by Deji, 2,000 dan by Lichang, 2,000 dan by Yu Chang, 2,600 dan by Changfeng, and 1,800 dan by Tianlong. Purchases included 3,500 dan by Gongtai, 2,400 dan by Hengyi, 3,100 dan by Da Chang, and 2,900 dan by Changfeng. The closing prices for Hankou cotton are recorded below:</p>

<p>August 3850, ..., 50,400 December 3835, Up 5, 145,600</p>
<p>▲Spot Cotton: Both Arrivals and Sales Stagnant: The spot cotton market has not shown any improvement. Sales are non-existent, and arrivals have also stopped.</p>

<h3>Sharp Decline in Overseas Yarn and Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>▲Good Harvest for American Cotton: Yesterday, American cotton lacked major buyers, Wall Street was weak, and the harvest was good, leading to a sluggish market. Futures fell by 2 to 18 thirty-firsts of a pound, and spot prices fell by 30 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 4 to 5 points, and spot prices fell by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. Indian cotton was weak due to the sluggish Liverpool market, with Bengal falling by 2 rupees, Oomra falling by 6 rupees, and White Broach falling by 1.5 rupees.

<h3>Grains: No Unloading of River Cargoes Due to Rain</h3>
<p>▲Rice Price Has Increased by About Two Yuan in the Past Four Days</p>
<p>▲Xin Zha: Yesterday, river cargo ships could not unload due to the rain. Only Wanshengtai and Yu Changxiang were conducting business, with thick粳 and thin稻 prices increasing by three or four jiao. Compared to the rice price four days ago, the price has gradually increased by about two yuan. Yesterday, Zhenzhen opened at 15 yuan and 8 jiao for its special grade thick 粳, Wang Kun opened at 15 yuan and 2 jiao for its high-grade 粳, and Zhuyougen opened at 14 yuan and 4 jiao for its thin 稻, with only three containers available. Unloading will take place tomorrow. The source from the western route includes four or five locations such as Kunshan, Jiaoli, Jiangyin, and Wangting.</p>
<p>▲Nanshi: The number of people attending the market at Fengji Wharf yesterday morning was sparse. Due to the continuous heavy rain, there were no transactions on the platforms, so there was no market report. There was a lack of ships arriving from the western route, causing public anxiety. Continuous heavy rain has damaged seedlings in the inland areas, and the situation continues to show rapid increases.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Continues to Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market continued to surge, mainly because the rain had not stopped and the disaster was intensifying. Mature and immature rice fields have been severely affected, causing inland customers to aggressively purchase without price limits. Although another ship of foreign wheat was ordered from Australia, totaling about 7,000 tons at a price of only 4 taels, 1 qian, and 7 fen, people were actively trying to sell it off. However, buyers did not consider the foreign situation, focusing instead on the current floods, so the market could not be suppressed and continued to rise. This situation is rare recently. As a result, this month's price increased by 3 fen compared to the previous day, August increased by 4 fen, September increased by 6 fen, October increased by 5 fen, November increased by 6 fen, and December increased by 5 fen. Spot wheat and high-end mills are not moving smoothly and remain stable. 1,900 bales of wheat from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Waigang, Penglai, Huangdu, and Jiading were opened and processed by mills such as Huafeng, Fuxin, and Xinda.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Increases Even More Sharply</h3>
<p>▲Inland Brokers' Buying Interest Increases Daily</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed another sign of increasing prices. Due to the continuous heavy rain day and night, the disasters in various places were intensifying. Therefore, inland brokers' buying interest was unwavering and continued to increase. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat was still 2 to 4 jiao lower, large and small factories also took the opportunity to sell off. However, the surging market sentiment could not be alleviated quickly, and the enthusiasm of buyers could not be diminished. The trading volume reached over 1.4 million in half a day, indicating fierce competition between both sides. This situation will lead to an increasing source of foreign wheat. As a result, this month's price increased by 1 fen and 7.5 li compared to the previous day, September increased by 2 fen and 2.5 li, October increased by 2 fen, November increased by 1 fen and 7.5 li, and December increased by 2 fen and 2 li.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Double Cocoon Goods Scarce and Prices High</h3>
<p>▲Ordinary Opening at Eighty-Five Taels ▲Prices Increased by Two or Three Taels</p>
<p>This year, the cocoon production in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is unusually poor. The production of double cocoons has also decreased, and Japanese merchants are aggressively purchasing at high prices in Shanghai, further depleting inventories. Supply cannot meet demand, and prices are increasingly favorable. Yesterday, a double cocoon silk factory purchased 248 dan of ordinary double cocoons from Wuxi at a price of 85 taels, an increase of 2 or 3 taels compared to before.</p>
<h3>Sales of Yellow and White Factory Silk to Europe Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market at foreign firms in this area was even more deserted. The European and American markets for yellow and white factory silk were practically stagnant. Telegrams received did not indicate any improvement, and the market atmosphere was depressed. Yesterday, only Ewo and others purchased 15 packages of white dried silk, and Yongxing purchased 10 packages of yellow reeled silk. Prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Needle-Shaped Green Tea Sales to France Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at foreign firms in this area, Ewo, Jardine Matheson, Tientsin &amp; Shanghai, and Tung Foo and other firms were actively purchasing needle-shaped green tea from various regions such as Luzhuang and Tuzhuang. Transactions were not quiet, and selling prices were quite firm. Yongxing Baochang and other firms also showed some interest in high-grade Zhenmei green tea, and the market situation remained unchanged. Gongxi in Low Zhuang, Ruy Cheong Foreign Firm in Baitouzhuang also resumed business yesterday. The entire city traded over 500 boxes, with prices opening at 31 taels, about 1 or 2 taels lower than before. However, there were no transactions for goods from the upper and middle Zhuang.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: New Orchid Seed Price Remarkably High</h3>
<p>The arrival of Xiamen tangerine peel has been very scarce recently, and inventories are extremely low, causing prices to rise frequently. It was reported that 37 pieces arrived the day before yesterday and had already been opened yesterday. Good quality goods were priced at around 20 taels, while the next grade was priced at 21 taels and a half, an increase of one tael compared to before. Orchid seeds have been out of stock for a long time, and now is the time for new products to appear. Only two boxes arrived the day before yesterday, making them quite rare. The opening price reached 55 taels, the highest price ever. Many expect the market to ease after more arrivals.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Various Qing Sugars Have Arrived</h3>
<p>▲All Sugar Sales and Market Stagnant Due to Market Allocation</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to reports from sugar-producing areas, the spot price of Cuban sugar remained unchanged. New York sugar futures for September increased by 2 points, December decreased by 1 point, and March and May also decreased by 2 points. Spot and futures prices for Javanese sugar also showed no fluctuations. Due to sluggish sales across various locations, the market atmosphere was depressed as a result of the market allocation by the association. Dutch sugar 24 Raw sugar white was 11 taels 4 qian and a half, medium sugar white was 10 taels and 9 qian and a half, both receiving little interest. Medium sugar white ground was 11 taels and 5 fen, and although there were some transactions, the amount was small and the market was flat. Interest in Taikoo Sugar was also quiet. There were some transactions in B mark, priced at 12 taels, a decrease of 1 qian compared to the previous time. The inventory of Dongwu Qing sugar in the market is very scarce. 3,000 pieces arrived yesterday, while 1,400+ bags of bowl Qing also arrived to meet market demand.</p>
<h3>Metals: Nanjing Arsenal Ordered Copper Yesterday via Telegraph</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the heavy rain made the metal market even more desolate. Apart from some decorative items, there were still few bulk transactions in the entire city. However, the Nanjing Arsenal sent a telegram yesterday ordering 50 tons of copper, which slightly enlivened transactions. Other goods remained stagnant, and there was little change in market prices. However, imports of eastern metal hardware have been vigorous in recent days. Because various businesses are unable to promote sales in the inland areas, they are all preparing to register.</p>
