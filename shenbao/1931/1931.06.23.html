<h3 id="c27">美總統宣言之影響金融界突然大變動 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>美總統停付債欵一年之宣言雖尙未成爲事實然其影響已使金價於一日間驟跌七十兩之鉅歐美各國之證劵價値提高巿面頓呈活氣嗚呼大人物之一言一動關係於世界安危如是</p>
<p>蓋各國處此經濟不振之潮流中失業無法救濟建設無法興辦若歐洲負債國復欲積金以輸之於美德國更須積金以輸於英法等國金價愈漲民力益窮而歐洲經濟將愈陷於不堪收拾之境今得緩付債欵一年可使各國抑塞之氣爲之一舒并可移此緩付之鉅欵用之於救濟失業興辦建設等事人心必能因此而漸安定前數日某經濟家演説謂世界經濟問題如賠欵債欵等不先解决則明年軍縮會議必無成功希望今有此緩付一年以引啓其解决之機會則其有裨於軍縮會議力亦甚大是美總統此舉之有益於世界豈僅經濟問題而已哉</p>
<p>今觀各國對美熊度德固異常歡迎英意等國亦多贊同間有一二有關係之國尙在懷疑中者終亦必一致助成此舉蓋以如此之經濟而不再設法使人民購買力稍蘇金價稍平商業得稍活動則各國皆將不利今僅得美總統一言世界巿塲已立見好况使果如昨日記者所言由此動機再進而得一澈底之解决則可信其有益於和平必更不少也</p>

<p>路透社二十一日柏林電　今晚德政府决定接受胡佛總統之提議查胡佛在决定扶助歐洲與德國後曾接德總統興登堡一電述德國危迫狀况謂若德國繼續有賠欵擔負則此狀况將不堪設想請美總統速予扶助遲則不及</p>
<p>路透社二十二日柏林電　昨日德政界與金融領袖聞胡佛總統之提議後異常快慰頓釋重負六月二十一日將在德國歷史中永有紀念價値因停付計畫適在最緊急時期而至挽回財政之崩潰否則全世界必有甚嚴重反響也德外長寇蒂斯咋夜發表一文謂德政府已通知美國對於胡佛總統之提議已欣感接受德國於此可獲緩和其數約及七千五百萬鎊又謂楊格計畫修正之可能性不因停付辦法而受影響逆料英意即將宣佈贊成美總統提議之意惟法國態度則較爲難言法國似有犧牲因法國所應受於德國者四千萬鎊而其所須付之戰債義務祗二千萬鎊是以法國將損失二千萬鎊惟渠不信法國將拒絕歐美之合作云</p>
<p>路透社二十二日倫敦電　英相麥唐納與財政大臣史諾登昨日皆不欲評論胡佛總統停付債欵之計畫但料麥唐納今日將在下院對於此事有所論列英國各報不分派别一致歡迎美總統之提議</p>

<p>國民社二十一日柏林電　美國總統停付債欵一年之計劃是否包含德國賠欵中之無條件年金一項此問題刻已引起德法二國間之異解法國方面謂該項年金不在停付賠欵之内而德國方面則謂各項停付之賠欵戰債因一律看待也德國論調之根據即美國正式之通吿因該通吿内明明載有﹁停付一切債欵之條件即各國政府與政府間一切債務之待付與重要債權國者一槪停付一年﹂是也美</p>

<p>依照總理的計劃在憲政開始的時候才實行五權制度後來中央同志在十七年國民政府改組的時候覺得五權憲法的完全實行雖然應在憲政時期但五權制度本身也應該有一個相當時期的試騐才能夠使制度的内容有一個　徧的充分的了解和確實的經騐因此在十七年國民政府改組時就確定成立五院分别掌理行政·立法·司法·考試·和監察五權考試院經過了一年多的籌備時間在去年一月就正式成立關於考試部分的工作由考選委員會負專責自成立到現在又有一年多了在這一年多的時期中間雖然没有把許多考試事業直接舉辦但一方面對於中央和各地方因事實上的需要單獨舉行的考試時須加以審核和指導同時對於實際的考試工作也有一個很積極的準備不過在過去一年中因爲考試法規都未完成所以在工作方面就偏重於法規的編訂考試制度的調查·以及考試方法的整理到了今年春季才由國民政府公布定於七月中旬起在中央正式舉行第一届高等考試而自六月中旬起成立高等考試襄試處開始辦理報名和其他籌備的工作現在就把重要的幾點大略説一説（一）考試資格現在考試法對於應考人資格的規定在第五條中共有五欵除了第一欵﹁國立或經立案之公私立大學·獨立學院·或專科學校畢業·得有證書者﹂第二欵﹁教育部承認之國外大學·獨立學院·或專科學校畢業·得有證書者﹂以及第五欵一經普通考試及格四年後或曾任委任官及與委任官相當職務三年以上者﹂的規定以外又有兩個變通的辦法就是在第三欵規定﹁有大學或專科學校畢業之同等學力經檢定考試及格者﹂第四欵規定﹁確有專門學術技能·或著作經審查及格者﹂都可以應高等考試因爲有了這樣規定在前幾月中間一方面就由中央及各省巿分别舉行檢定考試凡未在學校正式畢業的人自已覺得有應高等考試的能力就可以先應檢定考試把大學衷面多少基本學科加以考騐待檢定考試及格後就可以應高等考試同時在考選委員會内設立一個高等考試專門資格審查委員會凡未在大學或專科學校畢業而自已確有專門學術技能或著作的人只須把專門著作和成績送來如審查及格就不必先應檢定考試可以直接去應高等考試了（二）考試地點我們本來的計劃就想把全國分爲多少區無論高等考試或是普通考試都由各區分别舉行但今年因爲種種設備方面和各地方情况的關係不能使我們在全國各地同時舉辦同時又因爲現在的考試方法旣不全是中國從前科舉時代的辦法也不全是外國的考試辦法而是根　總理遣教所創造的新制度一種新制度在初施行的時期中總有多少不週到的地方自不能大規模的辦理因此就决定第一届高等考試在首都舉行因爲首都爲國民政府所在地也是中國全國的政治中心現在把第一届高等考試規定在首都舉行也可使全國人民對於中央政府所在地有更深切的認識（三）考試時期這次考試規定在很熱的夏天舉行這就由於事實的問題因爲考試院預擬的考場計劃因爲建築費的困難現在還没有建築起來如果舉行考試不能不借用學校或其他公共機關要借用學校的講堂或其他建築物就不得不在暑假内舉行所以我們明知道暑假期内舉行考試很不相宜但爲了實現政府的政策起見也就不能不勉爲其難了（四）考試程序無論高等考試或普通考試都分三個程序第一試是國文和中國國民黨黨義第二試是分科考試分必試科目和選試科目兩類凡應那一種考試的人都應考那一種考試的必試科目而選試科目是在各種考試中更專門的科目可以由應考人在列舉的科目中任選幾科凡應考人對於第一第二兩試所考的各科目平均及格以後才可以應第三試第三試是口試就應考人必試科目和經騐加以口頭詢問（五）考試種類這次舉行第一届高等考試規定的種類一普通行政人員二外交官領事官三教育行政人員四財務行政人員五警察行政人員我們所以只舉行這五種考試一方面因爲政府機關方面對於這五種人才的需要比較急迫同時也是使這次考試所得到的適當和需要的人能够去辦適當和需要的工作（六）考試組織關於考試的組織分三部分第一襄試的工作對於考試的籌備和臨時的一切事務差不多都由襄試部分去擔任第二就是内塲工作考試的直接工作由典試委員會去辦理典試委員會的基本工作就是審查應考人的資格擬定各科目的試題閲看試卷評定分數和最後的發榜典試的工作很重要對於外界的接觸就應完全隔絕所以辦理典試人員自典試委員會委員長·典試委員·襄試委員·以至典試委員會秘書處的職員在考試時期中間應完全在内塲住宿非等到考試完畢不得出外第三爲使考試關防嚴密起見在舉行考試時考試院應咨請監察院派定監試委員這些監試委員由監察委員或監察使擔任對於内外塲的種種工作都受監試委員的監視以示鄭重報吿畢散會</p>

<p>怠工動機　裕元工廠規模甚大計有四個工廠第一二三工廠係紡紗第四工廠係織布每一紗廠内分組紗細紗搖紗打棉等部搖紗工人之工資較任何紗廠工資爲少遂於十一日推舉代表六人逕與廠長直接交涉要求增加工資廠長張萬里人格和平當派員赴北洋等工廠調查得悉搖紗工資低於他廠當即接受工人要求以與他廠一律此在廠方原屬一種好意初不料竟引起循環性之工潮也蓋細紗部工人見搖紗工人要求勝利不能無動乃於十八日上午六時正値夜班下工日班上工之際突將一二廠之機器關閉夜班工人旣不出廠日班工人復不能入廠當時情形非常緊張廠方即用電話向公安局巿黨部社會局報吿公安局立派手槍隊·保安隊·特務隊·馳往彈壓把守廠之前後門秩序稍趨寗靜下午公安局又加派綏寗號鐵甲車到廠鎭懾</p>
<p>黨政調停　黨政各機關據報後以裕元怠工以前毫無風聲今乃突如其來恐有背景巿黨部派王君惠社會局派張進仕公安局派呂律先後到廠調查始悉怠工動機尙屬單純當向工人開導謂要求加薪應由工會用書面列舉理由向廠方請求同時並應向黨政各機關報吿如果廠方不接受條件黨政機關可以出來調解調解無效方可怠工乃此次旣不由工會請求又不向黨政機關報吿復無書面向廠方提出驟然怠工於手續上實屬不合但事已至此請工人推舉代表以便磋商不意工人恐推舉代表將來有被開革之危險無人出面接洽致無結果下午三時王君惠等再到工廠曉以利害仍請推舉代表以便與廠方接洽否則無法解决結果工人仍互相推諉無人願負代表責任王君惠等乃徵詢廠方意見而廠方態度非常堅决認爲本廠工資並不低於他廠本廠營業果有盈餘即加工資亦不成問題惟現在每年賠累數十萬元假使工人不能相諒迫而倒閉亦屬無法云云王君惠等以事甚棘手遂謝絕調停</p>
<p>資方態度　據廠長張萬里談稱敝廠資本五百六十萬元内有大倉洋行日金二百萬元在當時借日債時日金行情甚低國幣每百元合日金七十五元現在國幣二百四十餘元始合日金一百元即此一項損失已不下三百萬元加以原料漲價出品捐税重重以及債欵利息成本高而售價低每年賠累須四五十萬元所以不即停工者因爲五千六百餘工人之失業可慮不得不苟延殘喘敝廠愛護工人問心無愧即如本月十一日搖紗工人要求增加工資敝廠即派員調查果低於其他工廠當即照加不料細紗工人見搖紗工人要求勝利遂思效尤殊不知細紗工人每日工資平均在六角以上不但本巿其他紗廠無此高額工資即生活程度最高之上海亦不過如是所以敝廠對此要求斷難承認因爲廠方無力負擔即退一步説勉力承認其要求而粗紗打棉以及織布工人勢必援例請求敝廠不承認則無辭以解承認則力不勝任且此次細紗工人之怠工已軼出常軌故希望工人覺悟恢復工作勿受少數不良分子所利用敝廠認此次怠工旣無理由且不合法怠工期間之工資敝廠槪不負責而况第一二兩廠之怠工（約一千三四百人）連累第三四廠四千餘工人不能工作此四千餘工人徒受工資之損失寗不太寃本廠爲體恤多數工友起見擬將少數不良分子斥退令其餘之良善工友復工萬一少數不良分子挾持全體工友相要挾使敝廠不能行使職權祇好聽之將來不幸發生别項事件影響社會安寗秩序敝廠不能負責業將此意向黨政方面聲明云云</p>
<p>宣佈停工　昨日黨政方面因勞資兩方各趨極端陷於僵局無法調解均各廢然而返公安局因治安關係飭令鄕區土城子警察分所派自行車手槍隊兩大隊保安隊一中隊嚴密警戒工廠圍墻四角之更樓亦派警守望該廠查工股已於昨晚貼出停工佈吿云﹁一二廠細紗部甲乙兩班罷工堅不出廠全廠陷入停頓狀態無法開工望各知悉此佈裕元紡織公司查工股謹啓六月十八日﹂</p>
<p>勞方態度　此次倡議怠工者係一二兩廠之細紗工人於十七日下午上班（夜班）後一般工頭遂開會議僉謂現在百物昂貴我們收入之工資不能維持生活本廠工會又不替衆工友要求我們祗好自已聯合一致向廠長直接要求不達目的誓不復工試看搖紗工人未經工會請求直接要求已得到勝利我們應當羣起努力定能達到目的遂於十九日上午五時三十分夜班工人下斑時即將一二廠之機器封鎖宣言怠工並佔居廠内不散六時日班工人紛紛上工亦不能入廠工作延至午刻始相率散去此一千三百餘名之夜班工友宣稱不允加薪誓死不離工廠内中女工四百餘人因一切不便乃各自出廠回家聽候辦法此八九百工人昨日（十八日）未進飲食今日（十九日）各工友家屬聞訊始向廠内送飯今日有勸導回家再想辦法各工友依然表示誓死不離工廠並勸令未參加怠工者與之一致行動但未怠工者恐鬧成僵局必無好結果故甚遲疑</p>
<p>工會緘默　記者又赴裕元工會據各理監事談稱細紗工人每日基本工資四角八分早年工作有獎金例如每日每人應當紡紗若干支多紡若干支即有獎金彼時每人每日能得六角錢近年廠方爲減輕成本起見將次等原料紡製上等紗綫以致機器能力不能勝任工友每班工作十一小時半雖無一分鐘之休息而出品仍難足額於是每日出品溢額之獎金乃無形取銷廠方因出品減少而不满意工人復因出品減少而受損失所以此次要求每日加工資九分工徒每日加五分工人此項要求並未向工會報吿手續殊屬不合工會對於工人之要求自屬同情對其如此舉動實不满意現在旣無法勸令復工欲請廠方接受工人要求又無根據祗好暫取緘默態度惟希望資勞兩方讓步以便早日復工尤希望怠工者覺悟否則不幸因此而迫工廠停辦不但五千六百餘工人失業而間接仰賴工人以生活者其失業當不下兩三萬人也（六月十九日）</p>

<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>董修甲著</p>
<p>歐美各國對於巿政非常重視如巿政不發達則有礙國家的富源及社會的秩序實多我國近年來國民政府在建設時期也極注意巿政的改革力求各巿之新發展或派專員赴歐美考察或分頭在國内詳爲調查巿政以資借鑑如京滬杭漢四大都巿握全國之樞紐實該將其行政之設施作系統調查以資爲國内巿政的比較研究捨其短取其長巿政的發達當爲期不遠唯京滬杭三巿政府最形重要因其機關繁複事業甚多如南京巿則分工務·財政·衛生·社會·教育·土地六局與秘書處及參事室上海市則分工務·財政·公安·衛生·社會·教育·公用·港務·土地等局與秘書處參事室上海公共租界工部局與法租界工部局均分多處辦事杭州巿則分公安·工務·財政三局與秘書處及土地教育社會衛生四科但學者研究巿政學如此等巿政狀况却有詳悉的必要將此一切設施加以探討並與此三巿之辦法切實比較以作改善它巿的借鏡作者有鑑於此同時爲自已的責任所在即有這巿政的考察將四大都巿的特别優點一一詳加述明更附有改良巿政的管見以供研究者或責任者所採擇所陳各點雖槪爲歐美各大都巿已經實行甚久著有成效的辦法但亦我國各大都巿亟應仿效之辦法所以此種巿政調查報吿關係全國各都巿巿政前途甚大本書的價値於此亦可見諸一斑至於作者爲巿政專家在此是更毌庸介紹的了</p>
<p>全書計分九章第一章爲總務作者爲使之有系統起見將以歸納法而叙述之總務包括巿政府及其各局處科有公用性質事務而言如辦事程序管卷制度用人方法考勤方法統計編製宣傅方法節省用品合府辦公與各局第一科裁撤問題採購集中等各種問題其最著此外關於訓政時期之計劃亦係巿府應加注意的問題應認爲屬於總務的作者槪歸入這總務章内討論辦事程序是説明一機關辦事的秩序根據一機關細則或通則而繪製的爲職員辦事的指南針於辦事上最爲有益於一機關的新職員尤爲有用現在各國都巿爲免除辦事錯誤及減少隨時將辦事手續説明於新職員起見於各機關的辦公室内槪懸有辦公程序一紙其法至善我國各大都巿槪效此法足見巿政的進步不可衡量此雖爲極普通之事但眞正研究巿政學者却有詳爲調查其情形之必要</p>
<p>其次如巿政的宣傅方法亦爲重要巿民不僅須明白本巿所辦之事而已應將各國都巿所辦之事的先例分别迻譯國語印成小册分送巿民俾民衆知巿政建設各國均甚注意及我國現行的巿政方法皆各國早已實行的其它賴日報巿政周刋之鼓吹巿政演講亦爲重要凡要興辦事業欲企求有充分的發展則非注意此述各項工作方法不可於是六年訓政時期的切實巿政計劃始能有以實現</p>
<p>訓政時期的巿政計劃是以六年完成并訓令各省巿於六年期内（將訓政時期應行興辦之事業切實計劃分年進行以期自民國廿四年起可以依照總理遺訓實行憲政此次職分往京滬杭各巿考察巿政曾見杭巿正在籌備村里閭鄰自治事宜南京巿亦在研究劃分自治區域問題上海特别巿對於巿鄕各自治事務亦委有各巿鄕之委員積極籌備我巿對於自法之養成特呈准中央組織臨時參議會此皆感覺訓政時間甚短不能不對於憲政時期之自治事業預先籌備所謂未雨綢繆法至善矣唯各巿除於人民自治之訓練已經籌備外對於訓政時期應辦之工作似均無具體之計劃…職意凡事預則立訓政時期中央旣定爲六年我巿各局應預先規定六年之訓政工作按年完成之…因此巿府各局之工作旣有一定之準則全巿巿民亦可明白巿府逐年之工作而憲政開始之即可實行憲政矣﹂我們觀上所述足見訓政時期巿政的計劃極爲重要如按步就班切實進行及逐年將其改善則我國之巿政欲與歐美並駕則爲期也不遠了</p>
<p>第二章工務這包括的問題亦多有全巿測量問題全巿幹道問題路基問題道路材料選擇問題巿行政區計劃問題收地給價與築路收費問題設計委員會與漢口全巿之計劃問題等皆其最顯著者作者在此均分節詳爲討論</p>
<p>第三章公用行政查此範圍甚大但作者此次調查京滬杭三巿行政時關於公用行政問題中特别注意者曾對電氣試騐室之設置問題路燈整理問題廣吿問題交通信號燈之設置問題電車與公共汽車問題等五種此章内均有詳言</p>
<p>第四章社會行政此包含農工商業勞資問題慈善事業三類其範圍至大其職責至重即辦理妥善亦不見其成績與工務行政或公用行政完全不同此種行政爲我國法律最近特創之名詞係合前法律所規定之農工商局與公益局行政爲一氣者此種合併行政的辦法所以减少行政費移增於事業費的用意至良唯因行政範圍太大故辦理外殊屬非易作者此次分往京滬杭各巿調查巿政對於社會行政特别注意對於各巿整理與提倡農工商業勞資糾紛失業救濟巿民住宅慈善事業等各問題大加關心按都巿建設事業之發達與農工商業關係至爲密切如農工商業不能發達巿府的收入必無進步是都巿建設事業是亦無所振興了其次勞資糾紛已爲現代各都巿最麻煩的問題各都巿急應特别注意的如帝國主義者摧殘我國的勞工致發生種種風潮對於地方治安頗有影響故社會局對此勞資糾紛問題須切實研究一面依然總理勞資恊和的遺訓努力宣傅勞資的合作使勞工不致受惡化勢力的影響誤入歧途及資方在何能範圍内改良工人的待遇再次爲失業問題亦即世界各都巿最重要的問題在各國都巿中至今尙未有相當的解决方法在我國尤爲重要以設法救濟之其它諸項作者都分節陳明在此恕不加以贅言了</p>
<p>尙有教育行政衛生行政公安行政港務行政以及財務行政與士地行政作者均將所得詳加述及在訓政建設的時期如此各大都巿巿政作比較研究的專書實爲少見本書出版以來對於我國各種巿行政的進展當有莫大的影響并此所議各點在漢巿已有採用實</p>
<p>行的則發現特異的功効本書的價値於此可見的了</p>

<p>創刋號　聯合書店刋</p>
<p>中國出版界最近顯示着一種好的現象就是能注意於兒童讀物的發刋增進小學生讀書的興趣並指導他們正當的娛樂而不閲覽一切無益的壞書並且此項書籍書店裏又不能以營利爲目的更須力求定價低廉以減輕兒童的負擔不能象對於大學生或中學生那種書籍而儘量地剝削否則對於兒童教育的前途反有障　現今我要推薦於讀者之前的這本兒童俱樂部看他發刋的宗旨就是在應付這種環境而産生下來一種刋物它底内容是合於小學校的四五六年級小學生的閲讀不愁太高深也不嫌太淺薄並且採取各種刋物的長處加以革新力求文字的新頴和思的正確指示兒童一條光明的進路爲兒童教育改革的生力軍</p>
<p>同時小學生的思想很簡單如果經過相當的訓練和陶冶是很易走向有意義的生路然而養成他們的一種讀書和鑑賞的能力也極形重要眞的他們每天作些甚麽生活到學校聽先生講和朋友玩回到家中帮助家人作點小事情這些事情却是太厭煩了如果呌他們到娛樂的塲所裏去當然是使他們能閲覽這兒童俱樂部是最爲恰當的了如編者在本刋﹁見面　﹂中所説</p>
<p>﹁這個小小娛樂塲有人給你們説故事有人給你們講笑話有人教你們玩耍的新花樣有你們在課堂中聽不到的道理有你們在家庭中得不到的趣味它裏頭還有美麗的圖畫勝過那自然的風景還有淸妙的音樂幽雅的歌唱不亞於歌舞場的演奏彈唱還有那説不盡看不盡玩不厭的種種雜耍遊藝使你們聽了還想聽看了還想看玩了還想玩直至你們睡到母親身邊還耍夢想呀這是多麽好玩的一個娛樂場小朋友請來請來快來這個美妙無比的娛樂場</p>
<p>﹁小朋友你們每天在這個娛樂塲中玩耍一趟你們的知慧可以一天比一天增長你們的身體可以一天比一天强壯你們的品格可以一天比一天高尙你們上了講堂聽講格外有趣與朋友玩起來格外有味回到家中與哥哥弟弟姊姊妹妹説起來他們要格外對你佩服敬仰你瞧這個娛樂塲對你們是如何的有利呢﹂</p>
<p>這話却有相當的意義如依照這樣純正的宗旨去創辦兒童文學當然不致</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>有所錯誤可養成兒童讀書的習慣比諸父兄把他們携入不正當的遊藝塲内却高尙萬倍這裏所收集的故事童話等旣注意趣味又留心思想並灌輸他們許多世界上的文學知識和音樂知識如胡肇書的﹁我們爲什麽要學音樂呢﹂是一篇顯明的論説在開端作者就説明什麽要學音樂的五種原因（一）音樂可以使我們的身體健康（二）音樂可以使我們的精神愉快（三）音樂是一種好的交際品（四）音樂是一種最好的教育（五）音樂是使我們向上的一種利器這説當然是很恰當的音樂是可以使個人向上就整個的社會着想那又是可以使整個的社會向上因爲這樣兒童們却有學習音樂的綠故了其次是同一作者的一篇世界音樂家小傅丨悲多芬（LudwingVanBeethoven）以極淺近的文筆將他底身世及他所具音樂的天才都有詳細説及像這樣的傅記文兒童看了當然可以得到許多的利益至少在常識是可豐富一些即如我們成年的人讀了也無不有裨益而且關於名人的傅記倘若記載在歷史上那麽我們讀了却不能得到深刻的記憶這是一種讀書的經騐讀這裏的一篇小傅除引起無限的趣味之外並可多得一些音樂上的常識實有價値可言</p>
<p>科學世界一欄也極有可取如傅眞式的電話旁人聽不見的無綫電話機器人駕駛飛機電機打字機魚也會淹死的以及飛機保護果樹等都爲引起兒童知慧之作增加他們發明的靈感作者的文筆是以趣味爲主所以我們看了一些也不感到讀閲其它科學書那種的枯燥而乏味而且叙述力求簡潔没有一些空泛之語但在這極簡短的記述中已使兒童讀了得到多量的所謂科學上的常識了</p>
<p>桃花的歌是充满着無限的詩意作者在韻脚上是力求精練使讀者易於歌唱但並没矯揉造作的痕跡而减少明白質樸的詩意的本來詩歌是含有神秘性在此當然不能這樣須供兒童能以了解爲主所以這類的詩外表上看來是明白淺顯没有充分文學修養的人所寫下來似的實際要顧及種種困難的問題如易於歌唱便於了解等確實不易表現得如此的精密這桃花的歌可説是兒童詩的模型</p>
<p>其它如謝六逸的母鷄與鷄雛英兒和蔣蘅女士的免兒棉花尾巴和大鼈都是極形可貴的佳構我們讀了就能明白是出乎對於文學有充分修養的人的手筆不是普通一般製作兒童文學的人能夠寫得這樣的精美所以兒童文學並不是一種容易創製的作品同時在靑年們思想異常紛歧的現今對於兒童文學也不可加以忽視</p>

<p>Yuyuan Factory's Attitude is Firm, Haihe Slowdown Still Has No Solution</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Yuyuan Yarn Factory paid half a month's wages for June on the afternoon of the 22nd, but did not pay wages for the period of the slowdown. The Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau each sent representatives to mediate in the afternoon.

More than 900 workers left the factory on the 22nd and went home. The six representatives remained to hold on. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The slowdown at the Haihe River still has no solution. Wu Ou, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, conducted mediation on the 22nd, but to no avail.

The worker retaliated with a rattan cane, but there was no major conflict between the two sides. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to persuade the workers, and the workers returned to their ships. The situation was not chaotic at that time. The Party and government organs are actively mediating and should be resolved soon. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e27">The Impact of the U.S. President's Declaration: Sudden Change in the Financial World <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Although the U.S. President's declaration to suspend debt payments for one year has not yet become a reality, its impact has already caused the price of gold to plummet by 70 taels in a single day. The value of securities in Europe and the United States has increased, and the market has suddenly become active. Alas, the words and actions of a great figure are related to the world's safety, such is the case.</p>
<p>Because the countries are in this trend of economic depression, unemployment cannot be relieved, and construction cannot be carried out. If the European debtor countries want to accumulate money to export it to the United States, and Germany needs to accumulate money to export it to Britain and France, the higher the price of gold rises, the poorer the people become, and the more European economy will be in an unsustainable situation. Now, with the suspension of debt payments for one year, the suppressed energy of the countries can be relieved, and the huge amount of money suspended can be used for relieving unemployment and carrying out construction. The people's hearts will be able to gradually stabilize because of this. An economist said in a speech a few days ago that if the world's economic problems, such as reparations and debts, are not resolved first, the disarmament conference next year will not be successful. Now that there is this one-year suspension to initiate its solution, its contribution to the disarmament conference is also very great. Therefore, the benefit of this move by the U.S. President to the world is not only economic.</p>
<p>Now, looking at the attitudes of various countries towards the United States, Germany is particularly welcoming, and Britain and Italy also agree. If there are one or two related countries that are still doubtful, they will eventually unanimously support this move. Because with such an economy, if no further efforts are made to allow the people's purchasing power to recover slightly, the price of gold to stabilize slightly, and commerce to become slightly active, then all countries will be at a disadvantage. Now, only one word from the U.S. President has made the world market immediately look good. If, as the reporter said yesterday, this motive is further advanced to achieve a thorough solution, it is believable that it will be even more beneficial to peace.</p>

<p>Germany Overjoyed Beyond Words, Britain and Italy Expressed Willingness to Accept, France Felt Like a Bolt from the Blue, Japan Was Unwilling to Clearly Express Opposition</p>
<p>Facilitating European Economic Recovery, the World Market Suddenly Shows Vigor</p>
<p>United Press, 21st, Rapidan (Virginia) - Today, Sunday, US President Hoover is resting at this summer resort, pleased to see the enthusiastic response at home and abroad to the proposal to suspend war debts for one year. It seems that all European countries except France are happy to accept this proposal. However, the Paris government has informally stated that if Germany's unconditional reparations to France are also suspended, France will seriously object. As for the US Congress, President Hoover now believes that it will not be difficult to pass. Editorials in American and other newspapers have expressed great approval for this, especially in Britain. London believes that this plan will lead to the abolition of all war debts and the conclusion of a common agreement to help the world's economic recovery. It is expected that on the day of the successful conclusion of next year's disarmament conference, there will be an agreement to abolish war debts. The Germans are overjoyed about this, as if they have encountered the Winter Solstice. The German government originally had a plan to request a three-year suspension of reparations payments, but now it has temporarily abandoned it and formally expressed its willingness to formally accept the US President's proposal, but on the condition that it does not hinder future amendments to the Young Plan. It is now believed that this move can greatly consolidate the Brüning cabinet and prevent the spread of communist propaganda. The Italian government has expressed its willingness to accept this plan.</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st, Berlin - Tonight, the German government decided to accept President Hoover's proposal. Hoover, after deciding to help Europe and Germany, received a telegram from German President Hindenburg stating Germany's perilous situation, saying that if Germany continues to bear the burden of reparations, this situation will be unimaginable. He asked the US President to help quickly, or it would be too late.</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, Berlin - Yesterday, German political and financial leaders were extremely pleased after hearing President Hoover's proposal and felt a great weight lifted off their shoulders. June 21st will forever have commemorative value in German history because the suspension plan arrived at the most urgent time, averting financial collapse, otherwise, the whole world would have a very serious reaction. German Foreign Minister Curtius issued an article last night saying that the German government has notified the United States that it has gratefully accepted President Hoover's proposal. Germany can obtain a relief of about 75 million pounds. He also said that the possibility of revising the Young Plan will not be affected by the suspension measures. It is expected that Britain and Italy will soon announce their support for the US President's proposal, but France's attitude is more difficult to say. France seems to have made a sacrifice because France should receive 40 million pounds from Germany, while its war debt obligations are only 20 million pounds, so France will lose 20 million pounds. However, he does not believe that France will reject cooperation between Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, London - British Prime Minister MacDonald and Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden both did not want to comment on President Hoover's plan to suspend debt payments yesterday, but it is expected that MacDonald will make some remarks on this matter in the House of Commons today. All British newspapers, regardless of faction, unanimously welcomed the US President's proposal.</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st, London - The profound impression created by President Hoover's proposal in Britain is not limited to the upper classes. People in the streets, trams, and buses, who usually do not read newspapers much on Sundays, are today vying to read the Washington telegrams reported in the newspapers. Reuters reporters visited various important figures in and out of office, many of whom said that this is the best news in many years. Overseas Territories Minister Thomas said that the US President's proposal is the first and essential step in the world's recovery, showing that the United States has recognized that no country can be independent of other countries. Liberal Party leader George was also very pleased and said that in 1922 he had a suggestion to cancel all international debts. If it had been implemented earlier, today's blow would not have occurred. US Treasury Secretary Mellon is currently in England visiting his son at Cambridge University and does not want to comment on this matter, saying that the situation is complicated and this trip is of a private nature, but he has been able to contribute something, but he is not in a position to say what aspect he has contributed to at the moment. As far as war debts are concerned, Britain has to pay the United States about 33 million pounds a year, while Britain can collect a total of 33.35 million pounds in war debts and reparations a year. France pays the United States about 7 million pounds a year, and Italy pays the United States about 4 million pounds a year. It is estimated that Germany has to pay a total of 80 million pounds a year. The British Cabinet will meet on Thursday to consider President Hoover's proposal. The French Minister of Finance has been studying this matter all day with financial experts and the President of the Bank of France.</p>
<p>National News Agency, 21st, Berlin - Whether the US President's plan to suspend debt payments for one year includes the unconditional annuity in German reparations is a question that has now caused disagreement between Germany and France. The French side said that the annuity is not within the scope of suspended reparations, while the German side said that all suspended reparations and war debts should be treated equally. The basis of the German argument is the official announcement of the United States, which clearly states that "the conditions for suspending all debts are that all debts owed by governments to governments and to major creditor countries are suspended for one year."</p>

<p>Article 6 of Domestic Policy: Confirm that the people have complete freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication, residence, and belief.</p>
<p>Article 4 of Domestic Policy: Implement universal suffrage and abolish class elections based on property standards.</p>
<p>Articles 7 and 8 of Domestic Policy: Strictly define the statutory amount of land tax and prohibit all surcharges such as "鑒金" (mirror money), etc., which should all be abolished.</p>

<p>Article 9 of Domestic Policy: Investigate household registration, reorganize cultivated land, and adjust the production and sales of grain to ensure sufficient food for the people.</p>
<p>Since the US official announcement has repeatedly mentioned all debts, all debts, whether conditional or unconditional, are included in the suspension.</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st, Paris - Today, a semi-official statement said that the importance and generosity of the American action are admirable, but responsible parties in Paris believe that the suspension plan must be compatible with the Young Plan. The authorities of various countries do not need to exchange opinions before an international conference can be held. The date of this meeting has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, Paris - French newspapers believe that the suspension of debt payments originated from internal American charity because America's special interests do not allow German finance to collapse. The Paris Echo said that the French government hopes that President Hoover will not consider any actions that are detrimental to French interests. France cannot abandon the unconditional annual payment of 300 million francs that France should receive under the Young Plan. The Morning Post said that if President Hoover only says that the United States is willing to give up without forcing other countries to give up, then his actions will definitely gain infinite admiration. The Micro-Voice said that the suspension should be for a period of two years. The Exelsior said that the American proposal exceeds what France hopes for and even exceeds what France can concede. Humanité said that the arrival of the American proposal was like a bolt from the blue.</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st, New York - Most people regard President Hoover's announced proposal to suspend war debts as the most hopeful statement made by any head of state in the past decade. Newspapers have reported this news in large print. Although no newspapers have editorials, there is no doubt that public opinion will agree. Young, the creator of the Young Plan, who hopes to be the Democratic presidential candidate, said that the United States has spoken through its president and all parties support it as it should. This proposal is not only an act of clear creditors but also a beneficial statement from a large democratic country. He hopes that other governments can also act in this way. Once credit is restored, private interests will also benefit. To seek world prosperity, wisdom, courage, and goodwill are indispensable. He extremely approves of President Hoover's actions.</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st, New York - The New York Times' Washington correspondent said that since President Hoover has proposed a plan to suspend debt payments, there may be steps to reduce British debt interest rates. Now the domestic securities interest rate has a downward trend. The interest rates on the first and fourth liberty bonds, from 3.5% to 4.5%, will all be redeemed on January 1, 1932, and new bonds with lower interest rates will be issued. Since the interest paid by the United States is lower than before, it seems that the British debt interest rate cannot be uniquely high.</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, Washington - Senator Borah commented on President Hoover's proposal to suspend debt payments for one year, saying that if military spending is greatly reduced and reparations are reorganized within a year, then the world's great recovery can follow. Otherwise, extending the debt payment period will be of no help.</p>

<p>Reuters, 21st, Vienna - Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Schober said that President Hoover's move to suspend war debt reparations for one year will be the starting point for true peace in Europe and the world in general.</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st, Geneva - The League of Nations welcomes President Hoover's proposal to suspend debt payments for one year, believing that this move will have a far-reaching and beneficial impact on the European Economic Alliance and is not only a good omen for the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st, Beijing - The Belgian National Daily reported that the US President's proposal will result in a net shortage of 580,000,000 francs for Belgium, so this proposal must be closely studied.</p>
<p>National News Agency, 22nd, Tokyo - Japanese Ministry of Finance officials today expressed their agreement in principle with the US President's proposal to suspend war debts for one year. However, Japan's situation is different from that of European countries. Japan has no war debts to the United States, and the 1931 budget already includes 6.3 million yen in German reparations. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the suspension proposal can be passed in the Japanese Diet. Japan fully agrees with President Hoover's fundamental plan to release the world from the heavy burden of war debts and promote economic recovery. However, before the government officially expresses its position, it is still necessary to carefully study the impact of the American plan.</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, Tokyo - A Japanese government spokesperson said today that there are two main reasons for the current global recession: one is the excessive burden of military spending, and the other is the concentration of cash in the United States and France. If the US President's proposal is accepted, it will greatly improve the prospects for the next Disarmament Conference because the United States can say at that time: "The United States has already helped to alleviate one of the major causes of the recession. The other cause should be cleared by European countries."</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, Tokyo - Japanese newspapers have not yet commented on President Hoover's proposal, but Mori Ken, who has held important government financial positions, published an interview with the Japan Public News Agency, saying that this proposal will have a good impact both materially and psychologically to curb the current economic downturn and can make capital flow more easily. It can temporarily avoid the inflow of cash into the United States. Although Japan has little direct contact, it can also benefit to some extent. He believes that the US President's move can re-ignite the discussion of the entire issue.</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, London - Today, the stock market opened with a new atmosphere. All securities rose in price due to the US President's proposal. Young bonds have risen from 66 to 74.5.</p>
<p>National News Agency, 22nd, Berlin - After the announcement of the US President's suspension plan, the stock exchange market here this morning suddenly became brisk, and the prices of all securities were much higher than the closing prices on Saturday. There was a lot of trading within a few hours of the opening, and it is feared that the number of transactions today could set a new record. On this day of financial panic, this phenomenon is indeed not easy.</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, Tokyo - Today, the prices of various securities on the stock exchange were firm and trending upward due to the US President's suggestion to suspend war debts for one year. This morning, the cotton market was also very active, and the forward prices were very high, which has not been seen for months. The silk market also has a rapid upward trend. Rice prices have also risen.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Central Party and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters - At 9:00 am on June 22nd, the Central Party Headquarters held the 117th Memorial Week in the Great Hall. Central Committee members Kong Xiangxi, Ding Weifen, Chen Guofu, Fang Juehui, Wang Boling, Miao Peicheng, and staff from various departments and guests, about 500 people, attended. Ding Weifen presided. After the ceremony, Kong Xiangxi reported on the key points of the Provisional Constitution regarding people's livelihood: (1) Introduction: Because the primary task of construction is people's livelihood, the chapter on people's livelihood in the Provisional Constitution is very important. This chapter clearly declares the guidelines for people's livelihood construction, which can be divided into four points: 1. Focus on encouraging and assisting production. 2. Focus on developing agriculture. 3. Focus on cooperation between the government and the people (i.e., state-owned and private enterprises are equally important). 4. Focus on labor-capital coordination. (2) Encourage and Assist Production: Foreign industries are developed but there is inequality between rich and poor, so now we focus on distribution. China's industry is backward and people's livelihood is poor, so we should focus on production. Article 33 of the Provisional Constitution stipulates that the state should encourage and protect the people's production undertakings. However, how to protect and assist needs to be studied. (3) Development of Agriculture: China is an agricultural country, different from industrial and commercial countries, so it should first seek to develop agriculture. Article 34 of the Provisional Constitution stipulates that various intentions are very clear, among which three things should be paid special attention to: 1. Promote the warehousing system, based on the ancient Chinese three-warehouse system (community warehouse, support warehouse, and constant price warehouse), to promote its development with a spirit of mutual assistance. 2. Develop agricultural finance. Improving agriculture first lies in promoting financial institutions to enrich its funds, and agricultural banks and farmer banks should be equally important. 3. Reclamation of wasteland. Military and industrial reclamation should be organized by the state, and people's resettlement should be encouraged by the state and carried out by private individuals. (4) Cooperation between Government and People: Developing state capital is solid the policy of the party. However, private enterprises should also be encouraged. Articles 33 to 37 of the Provisional Constitution stipulate in detail that the government should carefully plan the production plan during the tutelage period, just like Russia's five-year plan, to ensure that the country's capital and labor are productive. (5) Labor-Capital Coordination: On the one hand, seek cooperation from labor, such as working hours and wages, should not only seek benefits for labor. On the other hand, attention should be paid to labor welfare undertakings, assisted by capitalists and the state to promote various facilities related to labor welfare. (6) Conclusion: The provisions on people's livelihood in the Provisional Constitution only represent the first step of the guidelines and plans for people's livelihood construction. In the future, during the constitutional period, the second and third steps will be gradually realized to complete the legacy of the Premier. In short, the Premier's Three Principles of the People and the Industrial Plan are very extensive in their announcement of principles and implementation procedures. Although the chapter on people's livelihood in this Provisional Constitution is based on this, it is actually a strategy that meets the requirements of the times during the tutelage period. If it can be implemented one by one, the first step in the people's livelihood problem can be solved. After the implementation of the Provisional Constitution, the responsibility of the party is even greater. It is hoped that various important policies regarding people's livelihood construction will be actively carried out with the greatest determination and effort. The people will be fortunate. After the report, the ceremony ended at 10 o'clock and dispersed.</p>
<p>National Government - At 10:00 am on the same morning, the National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week. Yu Youren, Shao Yuanchong, Ye Chucang, Zhu Peide, Kong Xiangxi, Ma Fuxiang, Liu Shangqing, Niu Yongjian, He Yaozu, Zhu Luhe, Lin *, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, Wang Jiazhen, Ru Yuli, and staff from the National Government's civilian, military, and accounting departments, more than 300 people, attended. Yu Shiren presided. After the ceremony, Shao Yuanchong reported on the application of the examination system and the preparation of the recent examination. The words are generally as follows:</p>
<p>According to the Premier's plan, the five-power system will only be implemented when the constitutional government begins. Later, the central comrades felt when the National Government was reorganized in the seventeenth year that although the full implementation of the five-power constitution should be in the constitutional period, the five-power system itself should also have a relatively appropriate period of testing in order to give the content of the system a full understanding and accurate experience. Therefore, when the National Government was reorganized in the seventeenth year, it was decided to establish five courts to separately manage the five powers of administration, legislation, justice, examination, and supervision. The Examination Yuan went through more than a year of preparation time and was formally established in January last year. The work on the examination part is the responsibility of the Examination Committee. Since its establishment, it has been more than a year. During this period of more than a year, although many examination undertakings have not been directly carried out, on the one hand, the examinations separately held by the central government and various localities due to factual needs must be reviewed and guided. At the same time, there is also a very active preparation for the actual examination work. However, in the past year, because the examination laws and regulations have not been completed, the work has focused on the compilation of laws and regulations, the investigation of the examination system, and the organization of examination methods. It was not until the spring of this year that the National Government announced that the first higher examination would be formally held in the central government from mid-July, and the Higher Examination Assistance Office was established from mid-June to start handling registration and other preparations. Now, I will briefly talk about a few important points. (1) Examination Qualifications: The current examination law stipulates the qualifications of candidates. There are five clauses in Article 5. In addition to the provisions of the first clause "graduated from a national or established public or private university, independent college, or specialized school and obtained a certificate," the second clause "graduated from a foreign university, independent college, or specialized school recognized by the Ministry of Education and obtained a certificate," and the fifth clause "after passing the ordinary examination for four years or having served as a commissioned officer or a position equivalent to a commissioned officer for more than three years," there are two alternative methods, namely, the third clause stipulates "those with academic qualifications equivalent to those of a university or specialized school who have passed the qualification examination," and the fourth clause stipulates "those who have confirmed professional academic skills or works and have passed the review" can apply for the higher examination. Because there are such regulations, in the past few months, on the one hand, the central government and various provinces and cities have separately held qualification examinations. Anyone who has not formally graduated from school and feels that he has the ability to apply for the higher examination can first take the qualification examination to test the basic subjects of the university. After passing the qualification examination, he can apply for the higher examination. At the same time, a Higher Examination Professional Qualification Review Committee has been established in the Examination Committee. Anyone who has not graduated from a university or specialized school but has confirmed professional academic skills or works only needs to submit his professional works and achievements. If the review passes, he does not need to take the qualification examination first and can directly apply for the higher examination. (2) Examination Location: Our original plan was to divide the country into several regions. Whether it is the higher examination or the ordinary examination, it will be held separately in each region. However, this year, due to the difficulties in various equipment and the conditions in various localities, we cannot hold it in various parts of the country at the same time. At the same time, because the current examination method is neither entirely the method of the imperial examination in China in the past nor entirely the examination method of foreign countries, but is a new system created based on the legacy of the Premier. There are always some shortcomings in a new system in the initial implementation period, so it cannot be handled on a large scale. Therefore, it has been decided that the first higher examination will be held in the capital. Because the capital is the location of the National Government and is also the political center of China, holding the first higher examination in the capital can also make the people of the whole country have a deeper understanding of the location of the central government. (3) Examination Period: This examination is scheduled to be held in the very hot summer. This is due to factual issues. Because the Examination Yuan's preliminary examination hall plan has not yet been built due to the difficulty of construction costs. If the examination is to be held, it is impossible not to borrow schools or other public institutions. To borrow school classrooms or other buildings, it must be held during the summer vacation. Therefore, we know that it is very inappropriate to hold the examination during the summer vacation, but in order to realize the government's policy, we have to reluctantly do so. (4) Examination Procedure: Whether it is the higher examination or the ordinary examination, it is divided into three procedures. The first test is Chinese and the Three Principles of the People of the Chinese Kuomintang. The second test is a subject test, divided into compulsory subjects and elective subjects. Anyone who takes that kind of examination should take the compulsory subjects of that kind of examination, and the elective subjects are more specialized subjects in various examinations, which can be selected by the candidates from the listed subjects. Only after the average score of each subject taken in the first and second tests is passed can the third test be taken. The third test is an oral test, which is an oral inquiry on the compulsory subjects and experience of the candidates. (5) Types of Examinations: The types of the first higher examination are 1. General administrative personnel 2. Diplomatic officials and consular officials 3. Educational administrative personnel 4. Financial administrative personnel 5. Police administrative personnel. The reason why we only hold these five types of examinations is that on the one hand, the government agencies are in more urgent need of these five types of talents, and it is also to enable the appropriate and needed people obtained in this examination to do appropriate and needed work. (6) Examination Organization: The organization of the examination is divided into three parts. First, the work of assisting the examination: the preparations for the examination and all temporary affairs are almost all handled by the assisting part. The second is the internal work: the direct work of the examination is handled by the Examination Committee. The basic work of the Examination Committee is to review the qualifications of the candidates, formulate the examination questions for each subject, read the test papers, evaluate the scores, and finally announce the list of successful candidates. The work of the examination is very important, and contact with the outside world should be completely isolated. Therefore, the staff handling the examination, from the chairman of the Examination Committee, the members of the Examination Committee, the members of the Assisting Examination Committee, to the staff of the Secretariat of the Examination Committee, should be completely accommodated in the internal hall during the examination period and should not go out until the examination is over. Third, in order to ensure the strict confidentiality of the examination, the Examination Yuan should consult with the Control Yuan to appoint monitoring committee members when holding the examination. These monitoring committee members are appointed by members of the Control Committee or commissioners and are supervised by the monitoring committee members for various tasks inside and outside the field to show seriousness. After the report, the meeting was dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Successive Labor Strikes in Tianjin <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Yuyuan Cotton Mill's Labor Strike Reaches a Stalemate, Party and Government Agencies Are Unable to Mediate, and 30,000 People Will Lose Their Jobs If the Mill Closes</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Labor strikes have occurred frequently in the past two or three months, which is indeed a negative phenomenon in society. First, there was the waterworks labor strike, followed by the Hai River labor strike, as well as the Kai, Qi Xin, and Yaohua Yuda labor strikes. The workers have achieved considerable victories in all of these. Yesterday (the 18th), there was also a labor strike at the Yuyuan Cotton Mill. The general situation has already been telegraphed to the reporter. This morning at 8:00 AM, I took a car to Xiaoliuzhuang to investigate and record the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Motives for the Strike: The Yuyuan Factory is very large, with a total of four factories. The first, second, and third factories are for spinning yarn, and the fourth factory is for weaving cloth. Each yarn factory is divided into sections for spinning, fine yarn, winding yarn, and beating cotton. The wages of the winding yarn workers are lower than those of any other yarn factory, so on the 11th, they elected six representatives to negotiate directly with the factory manager, requesting a wage increase. The factory manager, Zhang Wanli, was peaceful and sent personnel to investigate other factories such as Beiyang, and learned that the winding yarn wages were lower than other factories, and immediately accepted the workers' request to be in line with other factories. This was originally a good intention on the part of the factory, but it unexpectedly triggered a cyclical labor strike. The fine yarn workers saw that the winding yarn workers had achieved victory and could not remain indifferent, so at 6:00 AM on the 18th, just as the night shift was ending and the day shift was starting, they suddenly shut down the machines in the first and second factories. The night shift workers could not leave the factory, and the day shift workers could not enter the factory. The situation was very tense at the time. The factory immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, and the Social Affairs Bureau by telephone. The Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched a pistol squad, a security team, and a special affairs team to suppress the situation and guard the front and back doors of the factory. The order was slightly restored. In the afternoon, the Public Security Bureau dispatched the Sui Ning armored car to the factory to deter them.</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation: After receiving the report, the party and government agencies believed that the Yuyuan labor strike had no warning signs before, but now it has suddenly occurred, fearing that there is a background. The Municipal Party Department sent Mr. Wang Hui, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhang Jinshi, and the Public Security Bureau sent Lu Lü one after another to the factory to investigate. It was only then that they learned that the motive for the strike was still simple. They then enlightened the workers, saying that a request for a salary increase should be submitted to the factory by the trade union in writing, listing the reasons, and at the same time, it should be reported to the party and government agencies. If the factory does not accept the conditions, the party and government agencies can come out to mediate. A strike can only be carried out if mediation fails. However, this time, it was not requested by the trade union, nor was it reported to the party and government agencies, and no written statement was submitted to the factory. A sudden strike is not in line with the procedures. But now that things have come to this, please elect representatives for consultation. Unexpectedly, the workers were afraid that the elected representatives would be dismissed in the future, and no one came forward to negotiate, resulting in no results. At 3:00 PM, Wang Junhui and others went to the factory again to explain the pros and cons, and still asked them to elect representatives for negotiation with the factory, otherwise there would be no solution. As a result, the workers still shirked responsibility and no one was willing to take responsibility as a representative. Wang Junhui and others then consulted the factory's opinion, and the factory's attitude was very firm, believing that the factory's wages were not lower than other factories. If the factory's business is profitable, a wage increase is not a problem, but now it loses hundreds of thousands of yuan every year. If the workers cannot understand and are forced to close down, it is also impossible. Wang Junhui and others felt that the matter was very difficult and declined to mediate.</p>
<p>The Attitude of Capital: According to factory manager Zhang Wanli, the factory's capital is 5.6 million yuan, of which the Okura Foreign Firm has 2 million Japanese yen. At the time of borrowing Japanese debts, the Japanese yen exchange rate was very low, and 100 yuan of national currency was equal to 75 Japanese yen. Now, more than 240 yuan of national currency is equal to 100 Japanese yen. This loss alone is no less than 3 million yuan. In addition, raw materials have risen in price, output taxes are heavy, and debt interest rates are high, while sales prices are low, resulting in annual losses of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The reason for not immediately stopping work is that the unemployment of more than 5,600 workers is worrying, and we have to survive. The factory cares for the workers and has a clear conscience. For example, on the 11th of this month, the winding yarn workers requested a wage increase. The factory immediately sent personnel to investigate and found that the wages were indeed lower than other factories, and immediately increased them. Unexpectedly, the fine yarn workers saw that the winding yarn workers had achieved victory and wanted to follow suit. They did not know that the average daily wage of the fine yarn workers is more than six jiao. Not only is there no such high wage in other yarn factories in this city, but even in Shanghai, where the cost of living is the highest, it is only like this. Therefore, the factory cannot accept this request, because the factory cannot afford it. Even if we take a step back and reluctantly accept their request, the coarse yarn, cotton beating, and weaving workers will inevitably ask for the same. If the factory does not accept it, there is no excuse to explain it. If we accept it, we cannot afford it. Moreover, the strike by the fine yarn workers has exceeded the normal track, so we hope that the workers will realize and resume work, and not be used by a few bad elements. The factory believes that this strike is unreasonable and illegal. The factory is not responsible for the wages during the strike period. Moreover, the strike by the first and second factories (about 1,300 to 1,400 people) has affected more than 4,000 workers in the third and fourth factories who cannot work. These more than 4,000 workers have suffered the loss of wages in vain. Isn't it too unfair? The factory, in order to care for the majority of workers, intends to dismiss a small number of bad elements and allow the remaining good workers to resume work. In case a small number of bad elements hold the entire workforce hostage and force the factory to be unable to exercise its powers, it will have to listen to them. If other events unfortunately occur in the future that affect social order, the factory cannot be responsible. This intention has been stated to the party and government.</p>
<p>Announcement of Shutdown: Yesterday, the party and government agencies were in a stalemate because the labor and capital sides were tending to extremes and could not be mediated. They all returned empty-handed. The Public Security Bureau, in view of security concerns, ordered the Tuchengzi Police Station in the rural area to dispatch two large bicycle pistol squads and one company of security guards to strictly guard the factory wall, and also dispatched police to guard the watchtowers at the four corners. The factory's labor inspection section posted a notice of shutdown last night, saying: "The A and B shifts of the fine yarn department of the first and second factories are on strike and refuse to leave the factory, and the entire factory is in a state of shutdown and cannot start work. Please be informed of this. Yuyuan Textile Company Inspection Section respectfully informs, June 18."</p>
<p>The Attitude of Labor: The initiators of this strike are the fine yarn workers of the first and second factories. After going to work (night shift) on the afternoon of the 17th, the foremen generally held a meeting and said that prices are now expensive and the wages we receive cannot maintain our lives. The factory union does not ask for the workers, so we have to unite ourselves and ask the factory manager directly. We will not resume work until we achieve our goal. Look at the winding yarn workers who have not been requested by the union and have directly requested and have been victorious. We should work hard together and we will definitely achieve our goal. So at 5:30 AM on the 19th, when the night shift workers were leaving, they blocked the machines in the first and second factories and declared a strike and occupied the factory and did not disperse. At 6:00 AM, the day shift workers went to work one after another, but they could not enter the factory to work. It was not until noon that they dispersed. These more than 1,300 night shift workers declared that they would not agree to a salary increase and vowed to die in the factory. Among them, there were more than 400 female workers. Because of all the inconvenience, they left the factory and went home to wait for a solution. These 800 to 900 workers did not eat yesterday (the 18th). Today (the 19th), the families of the workers heard the news and began to send food to the factory. Today, there is persuasion to go home and think of a solution. The workers still said that they would rather die than leave the factory and advised those who did not participate in the strike to act in unison. However, those who did not strike were afraid that the stalemate would lead to no good results, so they were very hesitant.</p>
<p>The Silence of the Trade Union: The reporter also went to the Yuyuan Trade Union. According to the directors and supervisors, the basic daily wage of the fine yarn workers is 48 cents. In the early years, there were bonuses for work. For example, each person should spin a certain number of yarns per day. If they spin more yarns, they would get a bonus. At that time, each person could earn 60 cents a day. In recent years, in order to reduce costs, the factory has been spinning second-class raw materials into first-class yarn, so that the machine's ability cannot be matched. Although the workers work 11 and a half hours per shift without a minute of rest, the output is still difficult to meet the quota, so the bonus for daily output surplus is eliminated invisibly. The factory is dissatisfied because of the reduced output, and the workers have suffered losses because of the reduced output, so this time they requested an increase of 9 cents for each day's work, and the workers requested an increase of 5 cents for each day's work. This request was not reported to the union, and the procedures were improper. The union sympathizes with the workers' demands, but is really dissatisfied with their actions. Now there is no way to persuade them to resume work, and there is no basis for asking the factory to accept the workers' demands, so we have to remain silent for the time being. However, we hope that both labor and capital will compromise so that work can be resumed as soon as possible. We also hope that those on strike will realize that otherwise, if the factory is forced to close down, not only will more than 5,600 workers lose their jobs, but the unemployment of those who indirectly rely on the workers for their livelihoods will be no less than 20,000 to 30,000 people.

<h3 id="e47">South Manchuria Urges Resolution of Steel Rail Payment for the Jilin-Changchun Railway <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Case During Wei Wuying's Tenure</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence, Republic of China, Year 17: Wei Wuying, the former director of the Jilin-Changchun Railway, believed that the Jilin-Changchun business was developing rapidly, and the number of trains and weight were increasing. The original 60-pound steel rails had too weak a load-bearing capacity, and he feared that it would cause congestion in the train. He decided to purchase 80-pound steel rails. The 60-pound steel rails that were replaced were sold to the Jidun Railway for laying branch lines. The purchase price of the 80-pound steel rails was borrowed from the South Manchuria Railway Company in accordance with Article 18 of the Jilin-Changchun Railway Loan Agreement. When originally reporting to the Northeast Transportation Committee, it was said that these steel rails were ordered from the Hanyang Iron Works, but after the approval, it was not known why the decision was suddenly changed to purchase from the Japanese merchant Mitsubishi Corporation. The acceptance was not carried out in accordance with the statutory chemical inspection procedures, and the South Manchuria Company had already advanced more than 900,000 Japanese yen to Mitsubishi Corporation when the goods arrived. At that time, Wei was preparing to report the reason for changing the purchase location and the situation of negotiating a formal loan agreement with South Manchuria when the investigation event occurred. Wei left his post in a hurry, and this case became a double dispute internally and externally. Internally, it was suspected that Wei did not purchase from the Hanyang factory but purchased from Japanese merchants without authorization, and the acceptance was not carried out in accordance with the statutory procedures. It is difficult to predict whether old rails were used to fill the number, so this case has become a major issue in Wei's unfinished handover of the Jilin-Changchun and Jidun Railways. Externally, the case of Wei involved the issue of interest. According to Wei's letter to South Manchuria, before the loan agreement was established,</p>

<h3 id="e48">News Briefs <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The advance payment was calculated at an annual interest rate of 9%. Now, because we do not recognize Wei's change of the original plan, we also deny Wei's recognition of the advance payment interest. Although the Japanese side has repeatedly urged us, we always replied by saying that the dispute has not been resolved. However, in fact, these steel rails have long been laid, and the Japanese advance payment has long been allocated, so the Japanese side's urging to calculate this interest or revise the formal contract cannot be said to be without considerable reason. Therefore, the authorities intend to first negotiate with South Manchuria to reduce the interest rate during the advance payment period, and then revise the formal contract for resolution. The original letter from South Manchuria to the Jilin-Changchun Railway Bureau is recorded below: "The case shows that your bureau previously purchased 80-pound steel rails from Mitsubishi Corporation, and our company advanced the price, totaling 1,182,058.74 Japanese yen as of April 5 of this year, with a calculation sheet attached. Please check and pay. Your bureau's letter stated that the Mitsubishi steel rail case has not yet been resolved, and all interest amounts must be settled and paid after the resolution. It is difficult to recognize the principal and interest. This case is the price of steel rails purchased by your bureau from the local Mitsubishi Corporation. Our company temporarily advanced the payment at the request of your bureau. The method of organizing the advance payment should be carried out in accordance with Article 18 of the Loan Agreement until the goods arrive at your bureau to conclude the loan agreement. If the loan agreement is not established, your bureau owes our company. The debt must also pay a certain interest rate. Recently, our company has repeatedly requested payment of the price and interest. It can be asserted that the interest amount in this case should be calculated according to a certain interest rate. In this situation, your bureau should immediately pay the debt or conveniently perform the procedure of concluding the loan agreement, choose one of the two. Please do not delay. Attached is the calculation sheet as of October 6, Showa 5, totaling 1,131,156.69 Japanese yen for the principal, and 50,902.05 Japanese yen for the interest from October 6, Showa 5 to April 5 of this year, totaling 1,182,058.74 Japanese yen."

<h3 id="e49">Negotiations on the Fuzhou Bridge Project <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Industrial Company Unable to Complete Construction as Agreed</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Jiangnan Wanshou Bridge in Minyuan spans the north and south banks of Taijiang and is the transportation hub of the entire city. In November of last year, when Jiang Pingfan was the acting director of the Construction Department, it was agreed to rebuild it by introducing Tamura Teijiro, the Japanese Consul in Fujian, to contract the Taiwan Daiwa Industrial Company (an engineering company temporarily organized by the Japanese) to renovate the steel-bone cement bridge deck. The agreed project cost was over 190,000 yuan, and the deadline for completion was June 10 of this year. If the project was not completed by the deadline, the company would have to compensate the Chinese government for a loss of 100 yuan per day (the daily ferry cost during the renovation period is 300 yuan). However, only one-fourth of the project has been completed by the deadline. The provincial government is preparing to ask the Japanese Consul, but the company said that the reasons for the delay in the bridge project were: 1. The Chinese supervisors arbitrarily picked on the materials and projects; 2. The subcontracted Chinese workers did not listen to the company's command. The Japanese Consul, instead, proposed five conditions to the provincial government: (1) Extend the deadline by three months; (2) Waive the overdue compensation fee; (3) Add additional subsidies; (4) Withdraw the official supervision; (5) Urge the subcontracted Chinese workers. The provincial government has not yet responded. However, the merchants and people in Guanyin Well in the south of the bridge, Zhongting Street in the north of the bridge, and Zhongzhou Street in the middle of the West Bridge have suffered losses in business since the two bridges were renovated and cut off traffic for half a year. If they are allowed to delay with excuses, the merchants and people will suffer even more. They have specially organized a bridge project negotiation support association to request the provincial government to negotiate seriously with the Japanese Consul, detain the representative of the Daiwa Company and order them to compensate the merchants and people for their losses. On the other hand, they will settle the account with them and deduct the amount due for the completed part of the Jiangnan Bridge. The remaining amount should be returned immediately so that our country can re-recruit workers to build the bridge. (June 19)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Anhui Province Establishes a Narcotics Suppression and Investigation Office <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Hao Zihua Talks About the Reasons for Establishing the Office</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Regarding the issue of narcotics suppression, the authorities have determined a new plan. The Narcotics Suppression Committee will establish narcotics suppression and investigation offices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces. The Anhui Narcotics Suppression and Investigation Office was established in Wuhu a few days ago. The office is divided into three sections. Hao Zihua, the director, has sent many narcotics suppression committee members to various counties to investigate the actual situation of narcotics poisoning, depending on the needs of the locality, in order to establish narcotics suppression and investigation sub-offices. It has been decided to establish them in seven places: Anqing, Datong, Bengbu, Hefei, Chuxian, Fuyang, and Hao County. Hao Zihua arrived in Bengbu from Wuhu at 10:00 AM yesterday (20th) to establish the Bengbu Narcotics Suppression and Investigation Sub-Office, and appointed Yao Xingqiao as the director. The office is located at the Yuelai Company in Hexia. The internal organization is divided into three shares, and the staff will start working within a day. According to Hao, the new narcotics suppression plan of the Narcotics Suppression Committee is to gradually move from a slow ban to a strict ban. The ban should be completely banned within six years from the 20th year of the Republic of China. Within six years, the narcotics suppression measures will be changed each year according to the circumstances, and the ban must be banned within the time limit. The Narcotics Suppression and Investigation Office will proceed step by step according to this guideline. The initial work is to start with an investigation of opium smokers. How many young people are there in each county or port? The absolute ban on smoking is absolutely prohibited. Patients and the elderly are registered separately, and a registration fee is collected monthly for a limited time to ban them. If the ban is taken strictly, smokers will not only be in danger of life, but morphine, Jindan, white powder and other drugs can take advantage of the opportunity to harm them even more. There will also be considerable bans on the trafficking of opium. If the opium collected by the planting households this year is not allowed to be sold or even found and burned, the planting households will suffer great losses, which is also unreasonable. Therefore, a considerable ban is still outside the ban on collection. However, the detailed regulations on narcotics suppression and investigation have not yet been issued by the Narcotics Suppression Committee. However, it is heard that the local party departments are still opposing it. (June 21)</p>

<p>Business Tax Collection Deadline: The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously resolved to implement the collection of business tax on April 1st and decided that the entire industry would acknowledge and pay taxes separately, ordering the business tax bureaus of various counties to earnestly comply. Wuxi has repeatedly convened business tax bureaus to jointly invite various industries with the county Chamber of Commerce to determine the amount of tax to be acknowledged on a daily basis. It has been determined that there are a total of fifty-eight industries with an annual tax payment of approximately 50,000 yuan. On the 18th, County Magistrate Pan, Business Tax Bureau Director Yang, and Chamber of Commerce Chairman Qian went to the provincial government and finance department to report the tax amount determined by each industry and personally explained the particularly difficult situation of the Wuxi commercial sector this year due to the silk market. Chairman Ye and Director Chen of the Finance Department agreed to allow a trial run for the determined industries this year, and all industries that have not yet been determined should establish a review committee to conduct a thorough re-examination and be handled by the bureau in a separate case, all to be collected quarterly and the collected taxes should be reported and remitted steadily. Now the Business Tax Bureau has followed the provincial order to notify the fifty-eight industries that have already been determined to pay the first quarter's tax payment before the 26th of this month for reporting and remittance. All industries in urban and rural areas that have not yet been determined are limited to actively contact and acknowledge payment within five days in order to achieve consistency. As for the starting date of collection, the Chamber of Commerce has strived to negotiate with the province, and it has now been agreed that when paying the first quarter's tax payment, the month will not be temporarily noted on the receipt, and will be handled in accordance with the general plan after the entire province makes a decision.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Chairman Resigns Due to Business Tax: The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce held a meeting of industry leaders at 2 PM on the 21st to discuss the business tax recognition amount, as a final negotiation was required. Representatives from 31 industries, totaling more than 60 people, attended. Chairman Guo Cifen also attended despite his illness. After the meeting, the Chamber of Commerce first reported the details of the negotiations with the Business Tax Bureau one by one and advised each industry to automatically increase the recognition amount in order to reach a satisfactory resolution. Each industry requested that the agreed recognition amount for industries that had not yet been recognized last time be increased. If more than 30,000 yuan can be raised, unlisted industry shops and village towns, totaling approximately 50,000 or more, will be added. However, most of those who have not recognized the amount cannot determine the recognition amount due to brokerage fees and exemption requests. At this point in the discussion, County Magistrate Zhang, due to the provincial government's telegram urging collection, brought the telegram to the meeting and earnestly persuaded each industry, but each industry still declined to increase the amount. Chairman Guo persuaded each industry to make an effort to increase the recognition amount by 20%. Many representatives of each industry were dissatisfied. Chairman Guo declared his resignation on the spot and withdrew from the meeting. County Magistrate Zhang again persuaded each industry to make an effort to agree, and the representatives had no choice but to stand up and pass the recognition amount. As a result, the recognition amount of each industry increased by 20%, totaling 24,000 yuan. Industries that have not been recognized will be handled directly by the Business Tax Bureau.</p>

<p>Created by Combining the Former Peiping and Beihai Libraries</p>
<p>Collection of More Than 400,000 Volumes of Chinese and Western Books, Extremely Grand and Magnificent</p>
<p>Recently, the National Peiping Library is about to be completed. The reporter believes that it is of great importance to Chinese culture, so he specially visited Cai Yuanpei, the director of the library. According to the investigation, the library was originally created by combining the former Peiping Library and the Beihai Library. The former was funded by the Ministry of Education. The existing collection includes 36,300 volumes of the Siku Quanshu from Wenjin Pavilion, 8,000 volumes of Dunhuang scriptures, more than 160,000 volumes of general books, more than 22,000 volumes of rare books, 8,600 volumes of Tang dynasty handwritten scriptures, more than 100 volumes of Xixia scriptures, as well as the Yongle Encyclopedia and many fine books from the Cabinet. The latter is a part of the China Cultural and Educational Fund's business. The current collection includes more than 75,000 volumes of general books, more than 6,000 volumes of rare books, and more than 150 kinds of complete science magazines. In addition, about 40,000 volumes of Western books have been collected. In June of the 18th year, the Board of Directors of the Cultural Foundation decided to combine the two libraries into the National Peiping Library, which is affiliated to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education appointed seven directors to be responsible for the library and appointed Cai as the director of the library and Yuan Tongli as the deputy director. Later, the old site was too small and not suitable for library use, so the Ministry of Education was requested to approve the allocation of funds from the Boxer Indemnity to build a new library on the old Royal Horse Garden in Peiping, covering an area of more than 100 acres. Construction began more than two years ago. The construction cost is estimated to be more than 600,000 yuan. The construction project was handed over on the 20th of this month and the completion ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 25th. The building of the library is completely in the palace style, and the walls are decorated with glazed dragons, which are very rich in oriental colors. The library is in the shape of the Chinese character "工" and has three floors. The front part is for reading and the back part is for storing books. The first floor is for geography, the second floor is for general reading rooms, and the third floor is for observing rare books. The library faces Beihai to the east, and the scenery of Beiguang Mountain can be fully enjoyed. There are dozens of acres of open space in front and behind the library, planted with evergreen trees, making the air particularly fresh. The internal facilities are extremely magnificent, and the book storage is made of steel bones, making it the only large library in the country. It will inevitably make a great contribution to China's future culture and academics.

<h3 id="e64">Ministry Order to Remedy the Charter of the Changsha Middle School Student Self-Government Association <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the report from the Hunan Education Department, stated that the charters of student self-government associations at all levels of schools, in accordance with Article 21 of the Central Promulgated Student Self-Government Association Organization Outline and Item 6 of the Social Organization Organization Procedures, should be approved by the local senior Party Department and reported to the competent authorities for record. However, recently, the charters submitted by the student self-government associations of various secondary schools in Changsha City for registration are inconsistent with the Student Self-Government Association Organization Outline promulgated by the Central Government. If they are all filed for record, there will inevitably be obstacles in the future. If they are amended, the Party Department has already approved the implementation. What should be stipulated to prevent malpractices? It is reasonable to submit a request for instructions. The Ministry of Education ordered that the charters of student self-government associations in various schools, if they are inconsistent with the Student Self-Government Association Organization Outline promulgated by the Central Government, should still be discussed by the competent authorities and the local senior Party Department to remedy the situation in order to comply with the regulations, even if they have been approved by the Party Department for implementation. Furthermore, the "competent authorities" mentioned in Article 21 of the Student Self-Government Association Organization Outline, in accordance with Article 2 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Student Self-Government Association Organization Outline, are the county government in the county and the city government in the city. If the draft charters of the student self-government associations of various secondary schools in Changsha City are reported to the department for record, they should all be rejected. Furthermore, the Social Organization Organization Procedures mentioned in the report have long been abolished. All Social Organization Organization Procedures have been incorporated into the Amended People's Organization Program passed by the 101st Standing Committee of the Central Committee and notified in the Ministry's Order No. 786 last August. This is for your information.</p>

Attending were faculty, students, and 250+ guests.

Representatives from various institutions and universities, as well as the faculty of the college, gave speeches. Qiu Bincun gave a response on behalf of the graduates. The chairman then presented certificates and awards, and the graduates held an entertainment session. The graduating students this year had excellent results.

<h3 id="e69">Junyi Middle School <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Junyi Middle School on Guohuo Road in South City has been operating for three years, and its excellent performance has long been known to the public. This year, the school held the third graduation examination for both the senior and junior high school departments, adopting a strict principle, and those who obtained graduation qualifications were mostly excellent students. Therefore, the school held the third graduation reunion at the Atlantic Western Restaurant at the intersection of Yunnan Road on the evening of the day before yesterday (20th). In addition to all the graduates of the senior and junior high school departments, the attendees included the school principal Pan Gongzhan, dean of academics Huang Zaoxiong, all faculty members, chairman of the school board Wu Kaixian, school board member Wang Yansong, and all executive and supervisory committee members of the city party department.

Next, the chairman of the school board, Wu Kaixian, gave a speech, focusing on both academic advancement and employment, which was quite pertinent. Then, school board member Wang Yansong gave a speech, hoping that students would do great things in the future and become high officials.

After the ceremony, President Shao Lizi gave a report, followed by a report by Dean Dai Junliang, a speech by school board representative Liu Nanhai, and a speech by Vice President Zhu Jingnong. Then, President Shao gave a speech, saying that his ability was limited and he had not made any contributions to the school, which he felt very ashamed of, but he was very concerned about the school. He originally wanted to go to Jiangxi, but he came to Shanghai specifically for the school's graduation ceremony. Recently, many students have asked him for jobs, but he has introduced too many people, and his letters of introduction are not very effective. Occasionally, one or two students succeed, but this is not a proper way out. Students should follow what Vice President Zhu said and find their own way and walk their own path. Finally, certificates were given out and the meeting adjourned. The school has a total of 198 graduates this semester, including 29 students from the Department of Political Economy, 7 students from the Department of Law, 13 students from the Department of Literature and History, 3 students from the Department of Banking and Accounting, and 146 graduates from the preparatory department.

<h3 id="e74">Jinan University Especially Emphasizes the Spirit of Research <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Establishment of a New Economics Research Association</p>
<p>Jinan University bears a particularly important and great mission. Merely reciting textbooks and repeating what others have said is certainly insufficient to fulfill the task of national construction. At the morning memorial week ceremony, President Zheng Hongnian reported that in the future, special emphasis should be placed on the spirit of research. In addition to the gradual establishment of research departments in each college, the research direction should be as follows: (1) The Nanyang-Americas Culture Department must cooperate and connect with the Business College's Commercial Investigation Department, the Law College's Political Economics Department, and the high school's business courses, introducing all overseas Chinese affairs to the country and all domestic economic conditions, market changes, academic hygiene surveys, news of educational and cultural institutions, and the creation of domestic products to overseas Chinese compatriots at any time. (2) We should study practical knowledge. Simply discussing high-level theories is still not applicable. For example, the Department of Diplomacy and Consular Affairs should delve into the evolution of diplomatic precedents, especially the process of China's treaties with various countries over the past eighty years, carefully study and distinguish who is an imperialist, and formulate how to deal with them in the future in order to open a new era in the diplomatic world. (3) In addition to expounding research insights in ordinary academic theories and common sense, the publications of various colleges and departments must pay attention to the development and improvement of the department. In addition, new books and magazines should be purchased at any time to catch up with new academic developments. (4) Collect important materials related to the national economy, enrich teaching materials, and provide them for domestic workers engaged in the construction of new economies, and hire specialized scholars to establish a new economics research association (according to this association, the plan is very large and has been approved by the school's administrative meeting yesterday).</p>

<p>Since the Business School of National Central University in this city moved into its newly built school building in the spring, the scale has been grand, the facilities have been thorough, and the curriculum has been enriched. The college is worthy of being the highest institution of higher learning in the country. It is heard that the college is scheduled to begin its summer vacation on the 23rd of this month. Recently, teachers and staff have been extremely busy with semester examinations and graduation examinations, and even did not take a break on Sunday. The examination affairs will not be completed until the 22nd. It is heard that the school usually places great emphasis on academic credits. This time, only Shi Zemin, Jiang Zhilin, Ge Dingbang, Huang Zhongying, and four other students will graduate. Those whose credits are insufficient will be left to take the examinations in the next semester, which shows the high level of the school's students. Furthermore, the school will begin enrolling new students on July 7th. Recently, application letters have been pouring in from all over. President Xu Peikun is deeply concerned that there will be too many students in the next semester and that the original dormitory will not be sufficient for accommodation. Therefore, he has devised a method to set up another off-campus dormitory near the Water and Electricity Road, which is currently under construction and will be completed before the start of the autumn semester for accommodation. In addition, the school has always had extremely strict examinations for new students, such as economics, bookkeeping, logic, and oral examinations, which are all major subjects. However, this year's recruitment of new students will be held simultaneously in Guangzhou, Beiping, and Wuhan, and there is deep concern that the levels in various places will be uneven and that the economic and other subjects will not be prepared in time. Therefore, the school has decided to temporarily cancel these subjects to benefit the students, but after the new students are admitted, they must still complete the study of each of these courses before they are allowed to graduate.</p>

The final plunge of more than sixty-five taels was truly unexpected. The situation changed rapidly, with fluctuations of ten taels or more being commonplace, making it difficult for traders to cope. It was almost like a thunderbolt. The reasons for the terrible drop were that the United States had decided to allow a one-year postponement for Germany's war reparations, and that overseas silver prices had risen for two consecutive days. Furthermore, the atmosphere was unfavorable, and major bulls such as Qian Changxiang, Bing Xing, Zhi Fengyong, and others bravely sold off due to environmental pressure. Only the bears saw a glimmer of hope, so the market opened low. Later, the wind and waves were treacherous, with a sense of mountain shaking and earthquake. There was a rapid decline, but a small rebound. Foreign exchange has been lengthened by one level, and the internal market is also very sluggish. By noon, it had suddenly broken 760 taels, and the market initially stabilized. However, it was still weak, with extreme fluctuations, hovering around forty taels. It once fell to 730 taels, and the exchange rate became even more loose, causing great terror. The final count was thirty-five or six taels. This phenomenon is likely to be dangerous in the future. The big market this morning should see a big rise.</p>
<p>The market opened low and then fell. The market opened in the early morning of August, down 9 taels and 1 mace to 791.5 taels. The price of silver has risen to 92 taels after the big increase of one-eighth in the big contracts over the past two days, one-fourth in the silver price, and five-sixteenths in private telegrams. Afterwards, the major players all sold off. British gold also seemed loose. The banks first ate 1.5 to 1.75, and then the posting of 1 shilling and 2 pence increased by 0.25 US dollars and 0.50 Japanese yen, which fell by 0.30. At this time, it was only 74 taels and 0.5. Suddenly, it was 77 taels and 5, but the selling pressure was even stronger, and each number had sales. The market was in an uproar, and buyers avoided it. At 10:00, it was 68 taels. Banks bought British gold at 1.2875, and Hengxing and others bought in. At 10:30, it was 74 taels. After that, the exchange market became harder, and the suppliers were excited, but the words were disorganized, so it was difficult to collect information. After a small time, it fell by more than 17 or 18 taels. There were two or three taels of twists and turns in the middle. At 11:30, it was 56 taels. Qian Changxiang and others slightly entered the market, so it returned to 4 taels. At 11:35, it was 60 taels. Afterwards, the market frequently went downstream, and Xinhong and others sold off. British gold was bought by various banks at 1.3125, and finally it was 51 taels and 5 mace. When the noon closed at 53 taels and 5 mace, it continued to be made to 4 taels, and the announced price has been changed to 823 taels and 8 mace, which is about 50 taels, and the afternoon is 712 taels.</p>
<p>The market initially stabilized, followed by continued decline. The market opened at 56 taels, followed by 6 taels and 5 mace. Suddenly, it was heard that the Indian telegraph rose by 4 annas, and the selling pressure of the major players was swayed. It fell by more than ten taels, and the British gold bank ate at 1.34375. At 2:15, it suddenly became 30 taels. At this time, the Indian exchange rate rose by 6 annas, so people's hearts were even more empty. Only Qian Changxiang, Yuantai, and others bought in. At 2:20, it was 43 taels. In a moment, it dropped to 33 taels. Hengxing and others sold it. Later, the bank ate British gold from July to August at 375. At 2:40, it was 41 taels and 5 mace. At 3 o'clock, it fell to 36 taels and 5 mace. Then, buyers were active, and Huabi and others bought it at 375. Suddenly, it rose to more than 12 taels. At 3:30, the Indian exchange rate returned to a small 1 anna, and rose to 49 taels. In a moment, it fell to more than 12 taels. At 4:00, it was again 36 taels and 5 mace. In short, it was erratic and difficult to capture. The industry lost its will. Every five minutes, it increased to 40 taels and 5 mace. After 4:15, the wind and waves rose again, and the sellers were brave, especially HSBC, which sold British gold at 4375. Sanyi Zhengjin and others ate it. At 4:30, the market closed at 35 taels. Afterwards, it was made to more than 37 taels, and then it was more than 5 taels. It was extremely prosperous. Compared with the 19th (the day before the Dragon Boat Festival), the listed price fell by 65 taels and 6 mace, which is really rare. The maximum price of the day was 92 taels, and the minimum price was 30 taels, with a difference of 62 taels. The early market for goods was 90 taels, the noon closed at 53 taels and 5, the afternoon was 2.5, and the later market was 35 taels. The listed price was reduced by 70 taels to 923 taels. The closing price was 889 taels. The account was 57 taels and 54 taels in the morning, and 38 taels and 35 taels in the afternoon. The supplementary water was 57 taels and 38 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The prevalence of selling is beyond words. The transactions of each number are mostly sold out in large amounts, but the disorderly and complex situation is calculated. Qian Changxiang sold about 20,000 bars, Bingxing sold 5,000 or 6,000 bars, Cheng Fengyong, Zhi Fengyong, Tong Taichang, Hongli, Fuyu, Sen Changyong, Chang Sheng Yong, Heng Xingyuan, Yuantai, Yu Da, Xinheng, Cuichangshui, Yuanheng, and others all sold off. The number is also quite a lot. Dadecheng's exchequer is quite troubled. Yuan Maoyong, Wanxing, Shunli, Hengxing, Futaiheng, Yuan Kangxiang, Yuan Xingyong, and Daxing mostly bought in. In the afternoon, Yuan Maoyong, Zhi Fengyong, Yuanchun, and others were different. Yuantai, Wanxing, Shunli, and Qian Changxiang all entered the market. Hengxing had occasional ins and outs, but the number was not large. Tong Taichang, Futaiheng, Bingxing, Dadecheng, Yuan Xingyong, and Yu Da all sold out. The ins and outs of other numbers are different and difficult to explore. Speculator Wu sold out more people, and Lu sold out his positions. The Dalian gang sold 4,000 bars and entered 7,000 bars. The Guangdong gang entered 2,000 bars and sold a few hundred bars.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Foreign Exchange is Extremely Loose <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Bravely Dump</p>
<p>The Market Situation Plummeted</p>
<p>The British, American, and Silver markets have all reported rises in the past two days. Therefore, the HSBC listed price for each exchange has not been changed for many days, and it has lengthened by one level. The British gold has increased by 0.25 to 1 shilling and 2 pence, and the American gold has increased by 0.50 to 28.875 yuan. The Japanese exchange rate has decreased by 0.30 to 1 liang, 7 qian, and 1 fen. As for the internal market, it is also loose. From morning to night, there is a big increase and a small return. The gold market has plummeted by more than 60 taels, which is unprecedented and difficult to predict. Therefore, as a result, each exchange rate is compared to the day before the holiday (19th). British gold increased by 1 pence and 125, American gold increased by 2.1875 yuan, and Japanese gold plummeted by more than 1.20 yuan. The reason is that the American president has allowed a one-year extension for the US's German reparations. At that time, the bull players in the gold industry tended to sell off. The Chinese merchants bravely dumped British gold, about 1 million pounds. The bank's appetite is not bad (but the Chinese merchants still account for the bull market). Also, about tens of thousands of yuan of American gold were sold, and more than 2 million yuan of Japanese gold were sold. However, the market situation has been turbulent, with a sense of mountain collapse.</p>

<h3 id="e89">The Turnover of Interest Rate Seems to Have Improved Slightly <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>For several days, the bank has been closed for the Dragon Boat Festival and several days of the week, resulting in a long and quiet market situation. It began to operate as usual yesterday, so all kinds of procedures, transactions, and deliveries were particularly troublesome. The prices of various items in the market are generally firm. The external demand is not very strong, whether it is silver or foreign currency. Afterwards, although the market atmosphere has risen, there is hope that the result will not be a significant increase.</p>

<h3 id="e90">The Rise of Securities and Public Bonds is Still Strong <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Customs 20 Volume Rose by About 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>The Rest Rose by 0.5 Yuan to 1 Yuan, Several Corners or More</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot transaction of public bonds in the morning market was rare, and the futures market was very lively. In the afternoon market, due to time constraints, there was only one transaction. The futures market was still good, and the spot market had not opened. The buying in the morning market was very strong, and the short accounts made up, and the bond price continued to rise sharply compared to the end of last week. For example, the Customs 20 Volume, Customs 19 Good, etc., rose by nearly 2 yuan. In the afternoon, the trend seemed to ease slightly, but it still maintained its firm state. As a result, compared to last Friday, the Customs 20 Volume July futures rose by 1 yuan and 9 corners, the Customs 20 rose by 1 yuan and 67 corners, and the rest also had a good yuan or so. Only the whole Sixth Compilation Remittance Customs Duty 96 was relatively stable. The total transaction volume of spot and futures was more than 26.5 million yuan. The separate bond futures are now open and closed, and the transaction volume is higher than the day before.

<h3 id="e91">Yarn and Flower Yarn Market Slightly Affected by Gold Rush <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains strong, but the trend is slightly disrupted due to the sharp drop in gold prices by several tens of taels, which has significantly impacted the yarn market, causing confusion. However, current yarn sales are still robust, and the volume from Tianjin to the north is still smooth. However, various factories are suffering from a lack of available goods. The market is experiencing a significant shortage of 16-count and 20-count yarns, and a considerable amount of July-August futures have also been purchased. Therefore, the current yarn supply is running out, and market prices are quite firm. Considering the actual situation of the yarn market, prices cannot fall excessively. However, people are temporarily affected by the turbulent gold rush. If demand from various groups can continue to follow, there is still great hope. The Zhongxin Factory's 10-count "Ren Zhong" coarse yarn is also being exported to Japan, which is a good phenomenon in the history of China's textile industry.</p>
<p>The "Ren Biao" Market Bureau is Slightly Chaotic. The "Ren Biao" market opened with American cotton rising for two consecutive days, and actual sales were quite brisk. Scattered investors bought in, causing all months to rise by one or two taels. However, the sharp drop in gold prices to two or three "pan" caused great confusion, and all months trended downward, eventually falling by two to three "qian" each. When the market opened in the afternoon, it continued to fall by six or seven "qian" due to poor gold prices. In the third "pan," news was good, and there were still more than 3,000 "bao" of spot sales, boosting confidence again. All months rebounded by three, five, or six "qian." The total transaction volume was 74,800 "bao." Hengde sold 1,450 "bao," Rongxing sold 1,750 "bao," Yuande sold 1,450 "bao," Yida sold 2,550 "bao," Yiyu sold 1,900 "bao," Shenji sold 1,700 "bao," and Xincheng sold 1,050 "bao." Jifeng bought 1,250 "bao," Heshen bought 1,400 "bao," Yukang bought 1,100 "bao," Taixing bought 1,900 "bao," Changji bought 1,000 "bao," and Changfeng bought 1,850 "bao," and Xinxin bought 1,000 "bao." The closing prices of "Ren Biao" are listed on the left, along with the price changes and account balances. June: 16.67, up 1, 036,300. July: 16.76, 465,950. August: 16.80, 291,100. September: 16.60, up 5, 612,507. October: 16.57, 596,500. November: 16.56, 475,000.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Continue to Be Extremely Brisk. Spot yarn sales remain strong. Statistics show that all groups bought a total of 3,000 "bao" throughout the day. Among fellow traders, 1,285 "bao" of futures were purchased. Among out-of-town traders, Guangdong purchased 525 "bao," Hankou purchased 360 "bao," Tianjin purchased 600 "bao," Hong Kong purchased 100 "bao," Shantou purchased 150 "bao," Xuzhou purchased 150 "bao," the interior purchased 320 "bao," Yunnan purchased 170 "bao," Wuhu purchased 70 "bao," Gaoyang purchased 75 "bao," and other groups purchased 250 "bao."</p>
<h3 id="e92">Cotton Market Weakens <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is greatly fatigued, and the downward trend is severe, entirely affected by the gold rush, causing considerable anxiety. There are many new sellers, so the upward trend is very intense. However, the American cotton market is trending upward, and Japanese merchants are still buying for distant months.</p>
<p>The Hankou Standard Declines. The Hankou Standard market opened lower, following the external cotton market, and the situation is quite weak, falling by two, three, or four "qian" each. The afternoon was flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 91,200 "dan." Heshen sold 1,200 "dan," Dafeng sold 2,200 "dan," Feng sold 2,500 "dan," and Dingheng sold 2,200 "dan." Jifeng bought 3,600 "dan," Gongtai bought 1,800 "dan," Shenji bought 2,400 "dan," and Changfeng bought 3,400 "dan." The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e94">With Clear Weather, the Rice Market's Decline Becomes More Severe <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Xin Zha. Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and shipments from various groups were still pouring in, with about 30 to 40 boats arriving, resulting in abundant stock. Market sales were sluggish, and people's sentiment was loose. The top-grade goods from Changshu and Xichong fell by nearly a "chi." The market lacked interest in previous transactions, falling by two or three "jiao," and the future direction is difficult to determine. Only by seeking new avenues can there be hope for a turnaround. Transactions for "Yang Du Jian" were extremely few in the morning. Although arrivals were scarce, prices fell by a "jiao." There was little demand for "埠 Jian." The market for glutinous rice was extremely scarce here, and prices were difficult to reduce.</p>
<p>Hu Nan. Yesterday, about 30 boats arrived from the Huangpu River, and sales in urban and rural areas were stagnant. The wholesale price of top-grade "Hou Geng" from Changshu and Suzhou fell slightly by two "jiao." The overall trend was more peaceful than in Zhabei. The stock of goods from Tongli and Beixiang was not abundant, and the capacity of shops was limited. Prices for early rice fell by half a "chi." There was some demand for thin rice, but demand from Ningbo was still weak. There was also limited movement for selected high-quality rice in this area, and prices fell by a "chi." Arrivals and sales of "Yang Du Jian" were balanced, and the trend was sluggish. The "Bai Yuan" market experienced some changes, and the port was quiet. The market shape was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Silk and Tea, the Precious Eyebrows from Northern Wu Have Already Opened <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The "Zhen Mei" green tea from northern Wu, known for its excellent production methods in Wuyuan, had a large number of new samples displayed by teahouses such as Zhongxinchang, Hong Yuanyong, and Yong Shengchang yesterday, which attracted a lot of attention from British and French merchants. However, due to the recent price declines of teas from Tunxi and Suian, most merchants, while eager to purchase, had intentions to suppress prices. However, Chinese merchants, deeply aware of the poor harvest in the interior this year, adhered to the principle of "scarce goods are precious" and maintained an exceptionally firm attitude. Subsequently, Baocheng and other firms opened the first round of prices, ranging from 150 to 200 taels, which was 30 to 40 taels higher than last year for goods to the Northeast. The "Zhen Mei" green tea from northern Wu also opened at prices ranging from 70 to 90 taels, which was 20 to 30 taels higher than last year. However, there did not appear to be large-scale sales of goods from Tunxi and Wudong yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market lacked telegrams from the producing areas.

<h3 id="e140">Tan Yunshan Returns from Travels to Tibet and India <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>After a few days of rest, he will go to Beijing to report, carrying Gandhi's message to Chinese youth.</p>
<p>The National Government previously sent special envoy Mr. Xie Guoliang, along with Mr. Tan Yunshan, the editor of the Burmese Chinese newspaper, to visit Tibet. They traveled through India, crossed the world's highest peak, the Himalayas, passed through Darjeeling, and after more than twenty days, finally reached Lhasa. They stayed for two months, taking the opportunity to observe various facilities. The mission was successfully completed. Besides planning to write travel notes for the public in the future, Mr. Tan returned to the country from India yesterday and stayed at a new business inn. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency specifically visited him at his residence. According to him, the trip to Tibet was extremely difficult. Along the way, there was ice and snow, dangerous mountains, and the climate was cold, often below zero degrees on the thermometer. The two traveled by horse. They often saw mules and horses frozen to death. Mr. Xie passed away midway due to old age and physical weakness. The scene was very tragic. Mr. Tan persevered and finally arrived in Lhasa (Western Capital), where he met the Dalai Lama, conveyed the National Government's intentions, and used this opportunity to strengthen connections. He was warmly welcomed, and all his missions were successfully completed. Afterward, he took the opportunity to visit India and tour various Buddhist holy sites and major cities in India. He, along with Liu Renhang, Liu Xiunan, Daoyi, Biguan, the two Dharma masters, Gao Jianwen, Yu Pingke, and Zhuang Xiquan, fellow travelers, investigated Buddhist sites. Places visited included Bodh Gaya, where Buddha attained enlightenment, Vulture Peak, where Buddha preached, Nalanda, where the Tripitaka Master obtained scriptures, Deer Park, where Buddha turned the wheel of Dharma, Kushinagar, where Buddha attained Nirvana, Lumbini, where Buddha was born, and Jetavana Anathapindika's Park in Shravasti, where the World Honored One taught the Dharma. Samkissa, where the Buddha ascended to preach to his mother for three months, the king, ministers, laypeople, and disciples waited to welcome the Buddha. All were famous holy sites. He also purchased photographs and Buddhist souvenirs. Furthermore, he visited Delhi, the current capital of India, and visited the palace, the New Delhi Parliament, the Governor's Mansion, and museums. He also met with Mahatma Gandhi in Bardoli, West India, and stayed with him for several days, deeply moved. Gandhi asked Tan to convey a few words to the Chinese youth: "Dear friends, you must come and see me again at your convenience. My advice to the Chinese youth is that China's salvation requires pure, impartial love and should not rely on force, which only hurts life." Mr. Tan previously served as a Chinese professor at the International University founded by the Indian poet Tagore. This time, he investigated Tibetan and Indian culture and religion, with many feelings. After a few days of rest, he will go to Beijing to report to the National Government and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. He also hopes to do his best to communicate Chinese and Western ethnic cultures and plans to co-found an Oriental Academy with Huang Renzhi, Huang Jingwan, Wang Yiting, Dai Jitao, and the Venerable Master Taixu.</p>

They arrived in Shanghai at seven o'clock yesterday morning and docked at Wusongkou. A reporter from the Ri Ri News Agency went to Gaochang Temple yesterday, took a naval launch to Songjiang, boarded the ship, and visited Commander Gao Xianshen of the warship. He inquired about the examination process and other details. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Examination Process <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>In order to cultivate naval talents, the Ministry of the Navy recruited ninety-six new students in April of last year to study at the Mawei Naval Academy in Fuzhou. This year, another hundred students were recruited for navigation and machinery. Before being sent to the Ministry of the Navy, they were first recommended by the provincial governments and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The provincial and municipal education authorities conducted an examination. Those who passed were graduates of higher primary schools or above. Those who passed were then sent to the Ministry of the Navy for examination. A total of 335 people were sent from various provinces and cities. Among them, about sixty people who were slightly inferior in physical examination and eyesight were not admitted to the examination, which was a pity. The examination committee strictly selected only ninety-four people. Wang Shousheng, a student recommended by Guizhou, was temporarily delayed due to the long distance. A supplementary examination was held and Wang Shousheng was admitted. In total, ninety-five people were admitted. On the morning of the 21st (the day before yesterday), at seven o'clock in the morning, they were led to board the ship at the Xiaguan Naval Dock in Beijing. The ship set sail at about eight o'clock and arrived at Wusongkou this morning (yesterday morning) at seven o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Waiting to Change Clothes <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Naval Management Office had ordered student uniforms and leather shoes from a certain new clothing store. The clothing store transported the white drill uniforms and yellow leather shoes to Gaochang Temple for the students to change. The naval launch transported them to the Tongji warship at Wusongkou for distribution to all students. The exchanged casual clothes were stored or sent to the students' homes.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Student Age <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The youngest student recruited this time was twelve years old, accounting for one-third of the entire team. The oldest was only fifteen or sixteen years old. They were all energetic, spoke fluent Mandarin, and were quite lovable. They also had no thoughts of being far from home, which made their ambition even more commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Graduation Period <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The admitted students first enter the school as recruits for six months, then formally attend classes for five years. After graduation, they practice machinery for one year, navigation for one year, and gunnery for one year, for a total of eight years before they are officially graduated. The best students are sent to Europe and the United States for further study to achieve greater accomplishments. However, during these eight years, students are not allowed to ask for leave to go home without reason, and there are no long vacations in the school.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Departure to Fujian on the Same Day <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The ship arrived in Shanghai at seven o'clock yesterday morning (22nd). Because it did not stay long, it did not sail into the Gaochang Naval Dock, but docked at Wusongkou. In the afternoon, at about four o'clock, after all the students had changed into their uniforms, the ship set sail from Shanghai and sailed directly to Mawei, Fuzhou, to send the students to school.</p>

<p>Wusong Chamber of Commerce Holds Meeting: Yesterday was the third day after the Wusong Chamber of Commerce was suspended. All members of the association went to the chamber around 10 o'clock the night before to discuss solutions. The majority advocated for striving to maintain its existence, otherwise, all businesses would automatically close. After the standing committee members Zheng Dong and Zhang Zengjie earnestly persuaded them, they telegraphed the Seventh District Public Security Bureau to send District Officer Cheng to the scene to dissuade them, and also dispatched police to maintain order, fortunately avoiding any incidents. Then, all members elected representatives to hold a discussion meeting. Zheng Shushan was temporarily elected as chairman. Subsequently, all matters were discussed and it was resolved to first telegraph the Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Government of the Executive Yuan to request instructions, and also send a telegram to all provincial, municipal, and county chambers of commerce and newspaper offices nationwide to request assistance. Wang Yingru, Zheng Shushan, and Shi Yunjie were publicly elected as representatives to go to Beijing by the early train this morning to petition the relevant authorities. If they cannot achieve their goals, they are willing to dissolve the chamber of commerce and oppose the establishment of a branch office. Regarding the debt issue of the association, creditors are first requested to come to the association to register. Yao Pan'an and Yang Jingbo were appointed to handle the registration matters. The meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock. The text of the telegram is recorded below: National Government Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, Shanghai Municipal Government, National Federation of Commerce, to all provincial, municipal, and county chambers of commerce and newspaper offices nationwide: Wusong is the gateway to the Yangtze River and the throat of Shanghai. On land, it is the end of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway; on water, it is the crucial point for entering and exiting the river and sea. Its position is truly the key to the Southeast and the linchpin of the entire country. Since the Ministry promulgated the Chamber of Commerce Law in the late Qing Dynasty, the town's merchants and residents have voluntarily organized the Chamber of Commerce for more than twenty years. In normal times, it resolves difficulties and disputes, and ship merchants from all provinces particularly appreciate its protection. In times of crisis, it mediates and protects the military and political circles, and also provides much assistance. In short, the small local group is truly something that relies on reality, not empty words. Unexpectedly, in May of last year, the Shanghai Business Consolidation Association, under the name of consolidating Shanghai merchant groups, approved the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's reply, saying that Wusong is relatively close and there is no need to establish a special association. It is advisable to consider setting up a branch office and instructed the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to end its operations and hand over its affairs. Merchants and residents were greatly dissatisfied upon hearing this. Although they wanted to strive for survival, they always sought peaceful procedures to achieve their goals of making requests. Therefore, they went through the Municipal Association, the Municipal Bureau, and the great departments of the government, and their steps never dared to go beyond the bounds. They stated the reasons why they should not be reorganized and requested that the decision be withdrawn, and they appealed to the great departments to maintain their stance of striving for reasons, and they ultimately hoped to have a day of understanding. The views of the Chamber of Commerce members were exactly the same as those of all our merchants. Recently, we were fortunate to receive an instruction from the Ministry of Industry, stating that after reviewing the claims made by the association, there were reasonable grounds. We should wait for a factual report to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and instructions before issuing further orders. This order was on file. However, on the morning of the 20th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent Luo Qinghua, accompanied by Hu Yuqi from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and Jin Zhongjian from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, leading many armed police officers to the Chamber of Commerce. They announced the instructions, including removing the association's sign, confiscating seals, and sealing up files and public property. They specified each measure to be taken and demanded immediate compliance. At that time, standing committee members Zhang Zengjie and Zheng Dong, etc., informed them that the Chamber of Commerce had a reply from the Ministry of Industry, and immediately presented it for review. The reply said that although they should wait for the central government to resolve the matter, the orders from the Social Affairs Bureau were very strict and absolutely could not be delayed. The committee members also told them that the Chamber of Commerce is a group, so how could the transfer to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce be so solemn? We, one or two people, cannot be fully responsible. This was not allowed either. Therefore, the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, which has been in existence for more than twenty years, came to an end. I secretly think that even if the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce do not talk about the Chamber of Commerce Law, they should also know that there is a central government. Even though they have seen the ministry's order, they still disregard everything. If the Social Affairs Bureau issues such an order, it is close to oppressing merchants and residents. If the Municipal Chamber of Commerce issues such an order, it is using force to unify merchant groups and cannot avoid occupying the position of a commercial warlord. Now, under the clear blue sky and white sun, may I ask, if the central government does not allow the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to exist, no matter what, there will be no resistance. Why use armed force to intimidate? The Chamber of Commerce can be deceived, and the merchants can be deceived even more. In the future, for any small and weak group in the city, what kind of freedom of power and what kind of legal protection will there be? Suffering this oppression, it is not difficult for our merchants to strike in order to have a corresponding treatment. I am afraid that the crime of coercion by the masses will soon arrive, and it will be contrary to the original intention of peaceful negotiations. Therefore, representatives were urgently elected to go to both Beijing and the city to make appeals and petitions. First, a telegram was sent requesting the esteemed Executive Yuan, Ministry, (esteemed association), (esteemed newspaper) to review the unbearable insults suffered by the Wusong Chamber of Commerce and quickly preside over justice and issue instructions to comply with (provide assistance and forward the telegram to all chambers of commerce nationwide to call for appeals together) so that it can continue to exist to avoid oppression and maintain the law and the group. The entire merchants and residents of Wusong Town, Shanghai City, Shi Yunjie, Zhu Shijun, Bao Zijing, Lu Damin, etc., one hundred and thirty-five people, respectfully kowtow.</p>
<h3 id="e148">News from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Agency specially visited Wang Xiaoqi, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, yesterday regarding the Wusong Chamber of Commerce issue, to inquire about his opinions on future handling. According to his remarks, the original plan for Wusong to establish a branch office was decided by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. During the Shanghai Merchant Group Consolidation Committee, the 47th Standing Committee meeting discussed how to consolidate the Wusong Chamber of Commerce. The results of the day's discussion were based on Article 5 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, which states that "in prosperous towns, chambers of commerce may also be established independently or jointly," and Article 8 of the same law, which states that "chambers of commerce shall establish offices within their regions, and when it is deemed necessary due to special circumstances, branch offices may be established with the approval of the members' meeting." Wusong, as a prosperous commercial town, is actually qualified to establish both a chamber of commerce and a branch office. How should this be handled? It was resolved to send a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau for review in order to show caution. Subsequently, on May 17 of last year, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Reply No. 3774 was received, stating that the town had already been incorporated into the special municipal area and was located within the scope of the Municipal Area. The distance to your association is relatively close and transportation is also convenient. It seems that there is no need to establish a special association. It is advisable to consider establishing a branch office to integrate the organizational structure while enhancing commercial benefits. After receiving the letter, the Merchant Group Consolidation Committee again decided at its 50th Standing Committee meeting to forward the letter to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, instructing it to immediately handle the conclusion and handover. The association would then decide on the establishment of a branch office at the Chamber of Commerce members' meeting. After the letter was sent, on June 10, a letter was received from the Wusong Chamber of Commerce stating the reasons why it should establish an independent chamber of commerce and could not be reorganized into a branch office. The Merchant Group Consolidation Committee again sent a letter requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to review it. Subsequently, on June 25, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's first members' meeting was held, and it was resolved to establish branch offices in Wusong, Qibao, Jiangwan, and Pudong. It was submitted to the Ministry of Industry and the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and record. The Jiangwan and Pudong branch offices have now been established. As for the Qibao branch office, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau that the Qibao Town area, according to the regional division designated by the province and city, is in the list of areas temporarily postponed for takeover by the Municipal Government, and the branch office should also be temporarily postponed for establishment. Therefore, although the Chamber of Commerce received requests from the merchants and residents of Qibao to establish it, it complied with the orders of the competent authorities and did not establish it. As for Wusong, it has been nearly a year since the Chamber of Commerce members' meeting resolved to establish it. The Chamber of Commerce has also not sent anyone to take over, as handling merchant groups is purely an obligation and there are no rights involved in the matter. It was not until April 27 of this year that the Chamber of Commerce received Instruction No. 9260 from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, forwarding the Municipal Government's order approving the Ministry of Industry's consultation that the reasons for the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to change its location were sufficient and should be approved as proposed and forwarded for notification. It was also forwarded to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to immediately comply with the order to conclude and prepare for handover. After the letter was sent, more than a month passed and the Chamber of Commerce had not received a reply from the Wusong Chamber of Commerce. It was not until the 16th of this month that the Social Affairs Bureau issued an instruction ordering them to send personnel to guide the reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce. If it continued to resist, it would be dissolved. The wording was extremely stern. Another letter was immediately forwarded to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce and Luo Qinghua, director of the Commercial Affairs Section, was sent to guide the reorganization in accordance with the order. While preparing to handle it, on the 19th, an urgent telegram was received from the Social Affairs Bureau stating that it had received instructions from the Municipal Government to urge them to go for takeover. Therefore, the next morning, Luo Qinghua, director of the Commercial Affairs Section, and Xue Guangqian, clerk, were sent, accompanied by the representatives of the Social Security and Public Security Bureaus, to handle the matter. Currently, the seals and stamps of the association have been examined and received by the representatives of the Social Affairs Bureau. The official documents and files have also been sealed and signed jointly by the representatives of the Social Security and Public Security Bureaus and handed over to the Chamber of Commerce for safekeeping. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce handled this matter entirely in accordance with the orders of the competent authorities. As for how to handle it in the future, the Chamber of Commerce also knows very well that Wusong is located in an important area with prosperous commerce, and the Chamber's affairs cannot be allowed to be suspended. It was decided at a temporary standing committee meeting held today to submit a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. If it is approved to establish a branch office by the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce will carefully consider the candidates for the director of the branch office and will definitely select someone who is familiar with the Wusong business situation and can win the hearts of the people. In the future, all matters related to Wusong will be handled by the branch office at any time. More important matters that the branch office cannot handle will be transferred to the Chamber of Commerce for handling. If handled in this way, the Chamber's activities will not only be inconvenient, but its strength may be stronger than before. As for the debts owed by the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that those that are truly legitimate after review should be the responsibility of the Chamber of Commerce to sort out and repay.</p>
<h3 id="e149">News from the Social Affairs Bureau <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Wuchen Agency went to the Social Affairs Bureau to inquire about the details of this matter. According to the person in charge, the bureau received an order from the Municipal Government two months ago to reorganize the Wusong Chamber of Commerce into the Wusong Branch Office of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce in order to comply with the laws and regulations. It ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to guide the reorganization and instructed the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce to comply. After the instructions were sent, it had not yet complied. Now, it has received another order from the Municipal Government stating that the former Chamber of Commerce is still using the former name to the outside world, which is inappropriate. Therefore, personnel were dispatched to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce on the 20th of this month, together with the Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to take over. If the Wusong Chamber of Commerce is allowed to exist, then the Nanshi and Zhabei Chambers of Commerce can also cite this precedent and request to re-establish themselves. All the reorganization work of the former Shanghai Merchant Group Consolidation Committee will inevitably become empty. The various trade and labor unions in the city will also inevitably split up, which will inevitably lead to disputes. The reporter also inquired about the aftermath. According to reports, the bureau has ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to establish the Wusong Branch Office within ten days, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will continue to handle all affairs. As for the debts owed by the former Chamber of Commerce, if they are indeed due to expenses, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should be responsible for handling them.</p>

<p>Shanghai County Third Representative Assembly Declaration: The Chinese Kuomintang, through the arduous creation of the General Manager and the sacrifice of countless martyrs, has finally achieved today's unification. However, considering the current situation, the Red Bandits are cornered in Xianggan, and the disputes in Guangdong are suddenly arising. The people's hardships have not been eliminated, and construction is also facing obstacles. How should our party comrades unite their spirits, concentrate their strength, follow the General Manager's legacy, and devote themselves to the construction during the period of political tutelage? On the day of holding the third county-wide representative assembly, I would like to propose the following five drafts to share with all the people and comrades of the county to go to one day to thoroughly abolish the unequal treaties. In recent years, with the joint efforts of the government and the people, although the unequal treaties will only be modified, considering the neighboring environment of this county, the concessions of various countries are still in place. Foreign warships are frequently docked in the Huangpu River. Although the voices of consular jurisdiction and inland navigation rights being revoked have been noisy for a long time, they have not yet been realized. This has harmed the development of our industry and commerce and hindered the completion of our national revolution. Our people should support the government in implementing the resolutions of the National Assembly and thoroughly abolish the unequal treaties in order to restore our country's inherent sovereignty. Secondly, support the peaceful unification of the country. Civil war is not only a painful and shameful thing, but also the country's vitality is hurt and the people's livelihoods are seriously damaged. Now the Guangdong incident was originally a party dispute, but unfortunately it has now appeared as a rebellion. The central government is fundamentally tolerant and intends to use political means to seek a peaceful solution, which is what our people hope for. This meeting will sincerely support the central government's advocacy of peaceful unification, and those who disregard the overall situation and deliberately disrupt peaceful unification will be abandoned by the people of the whole country. Furthermore, such as the Red Bandits who are wreaking havoc on the people, the central government is fully engaged in suppressing them. The day of clearing them is just around the corner. All our people should rise up to assist the government in completing the work of suppressing the Red Bandits in order to lay the foundation for the country. Thirdly, determine the policy for the county's party affairs. In accordance with the central government's regulations, the party affairs work plan during the period of political tutelage and the actual environment and time needs of the county have been reviewed. The Assembly has decided that the county's party affairs work plan will be implemented in one for social investigation. Most of the county is rural, and the majority of the people in the county are farmers, so special attention should be paid to the investigation of the rural economy, land, household registration, etc. Secondly, to investigate the general education level, local customs and habits, and the conditions of schools, institutions, groups, and factories of the people of the county, and compile statistics as a reference and preparation for promoting party affairs work. Secondly, to promote the doctrine of the party, it is also necessary to examine the general rural masses who do not know the principles of the party clearly and have not paid attention to the seven movements and local autonomy. Therefore, this outline has been specially formulated and the methods of implementation have been defined to provide guidelines for party members' work. Thirdly, for the training of party members, five articles of measures for training party members are specified in the plan, and the thinking and actions of party members are assessed at any time, and the party members are effectively guided and corrected. Fourthly, promoting social undertakings such as the equipment and promotion of various public undertakings and cooperative undertakings, promoting the expansion of local education, improving local customs and habits, and assisting the development of rural undertakings. The above four sections are the minimum limit in the promotion of party affairs in the county from today, and I hope to encourage all comrades in the county to do so. Fourthly, promote the realization of the new county administration. The General Manager stipulated in the Founding Program that the county is a unit of autonomy, and local autonomy is the only important work during the period of political tutelage. Returning to the oath of citizens in this county, although it has been held, the land in the county has not been completely measured, and the household registration survey is still waiting for accurate statistics. The establishment of schools has not been popularized, and the handling of the police is not perfect. The construction of county roads has not achieved much. All these are important items for autonomy. We people only recognize the observation of the current phenomenon as the beginning of the earth. To achieve the merit of nine piles, we still need the joint efforts of all people in the county. Based on the above points, for foreign countries, the unequal treaties should be abolished and imperialism should be overthrown. For internal affairs, peaceful unification should be supported to relieve the suffering of the people. Locally, the new county administration should be promoted and the county's autonomy should be completed. I hope that all the people and comrades of the county will work together with one heart and one mind to achieve success. This is the statement.</p>

<p>Films of the various barbarian peoples have been successively published in this newspaper's pictorial section. Now, after passing through the Three Gorges to Yichang, the two gentlemen took the Pinghe Wheel and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The families of the two gentlemen and their colleagues from this newspaper were there to greet them at the Yangshupu Wharf. The two gentlemen were in good spirits, but their faces were slightly dark due to the sun and wind. In addition to their personal luggage, there were 14 boxes of collected products from the border area, which will be shipped from Chongqing in a few days.

The masses are all joyfully awaiting the constitutional and political construction, which is being actively promoted. Suddenly, a few comrades in Guangdong had disagreements due to political differences, which even led to military action and the danger of undermining unity. Our central government has always maintained peace and unity, considering the suffering of the people, and absolutely does not advocate causing war with force. All major national political affairs seek peaceful solutions from the fundamental laws. We, along with the people, must also be under the leadership of the central government. We earnestly hope that the new construction of the country will also unanimously follow the legacy of our Leader, strive together, and move towards the path of construction, striving for the welfare of all the people and the long-term stability of the country."

<h3 id="e166">Case of the Domestic Goods Mall's Closure <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The matter of the domestic goods mall being ordered to close by the Shanghai Municipal Council has not been resolved despite negotiations convened by the Chinese directors and the City Chamber of Commerce. The negotiation committee of the mall has been discussing solutions for days, and the employees are also requesting relief from all sectors of society. The various situations yesterday are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Report to the City Government: The mall yesterday submitted the full record of the negotiations at the Chamber of Commerce to the City Government for reference. The original report stated: "Regarding the matter of our mall being illegally closed by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession on June 19th, and the losses suffered by the staff who were beaten and arrested, [we] should directly request relief according to the law, etc., as instructed by the City Government's Order No. 1350. It is evident that the City Government is concerned about the people's plight and sympathizes with the difficulties of businesses, leaving no detail unaddressed. On the 19th and 20th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified our mall to send five representatives to a temporary meeting with five Chinese and foreign directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council. No arguments were presented during the report. We hereby record the case and respectfully request your examination and swift and serious protest to protect national rights and truly benefit the people. Respectfully submitted to Shanghai Mayor Zhang."</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry's Reply: The Ministry of Industry yesterday replied to the Cosmetics Industry Association, stating: "We have received and read the telegram. This case was previously reported to the Ministry by the mall and the Shanghai Chinese National Products Maintenance Association, the National Products Factory Association, and the Federation of National Products Factories. On the 13th of this month, we consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest and negotiation. We have now copied and sent the association's telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for filing and handling. Please be informed."</p>
<p>Letter from the Lawyers' Association: Li Shirui, Tan Yigong, and Lu Shaozong, the standing committee members of the Shanghai Lawyers' Association, wrote to the domestic goods mall yesterday, stating: "We are writing in response to your telegram of the grey day. We have learned with respect that after your mall moved to New World, it was suddenly closed by the Shanghai Municipal Council's police on the pretext that the entertainment section did not fully comply with the regulations. Our association is extremely indignant. New World has been an entertainment venue for many years. If it was deemed unsuitable, it should not have been allowed to exist in the first place. Your mall is still in its old form, and although there have been changes, they are unlikely to go beyond the scope of the past. The so-called non-compliance with the regulations is unfounded. Even if there are non-compliant areas, they should not involve the entire mall due to the entertainment. Furthermore, even if the Shanghai Municipal Council has a special view and believes that there is a violation of the regulations, it should request the court to approve it in accordance with the law. How can it act directly and arbitrarily? This kind of measure by the Council treats the mall's entertainment as if it were a current bandit. We cannot but recognize it as an extrajudicial act of violence based on impartial observation. We earnestly hope that your mall will resolutely not yield and negotiate based on reason and law. Our association will do its best to support you."</p>
<p>Declarations from Various Places: The Hankou City National Products Movement Committee, the Henan Provincial National Products Factory Federation, the Qingdao National Products Movement Committee, the Coarse Cloth Industry Association, the Silk Weaving Industry Association, and other groups yesterday issued declarations and telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government's various Yuan and Bu, proposing serious negotiations and the abolition of consular jurisdiction and unequal treaties. These groups are willing to provide their backing and vow not to stop until the goal is achieved.</p>

<p>The Japanese government, due to the collapse of the silk market, has already issued orders to reduce the amount of ant eggs for this year's spring silkworms in order to adjust production. It is heard that it will also restrict summer and autumn silkworms.

<p>Transportation costs also allowed to be reduced by 30%. Weicheng Company has long been famous in the national silk fiber industry. The products produced by the company are constantly improving and researching improvements in order to promote the industry. Because the lower-foot raw materials abandoned during silk reeling are unknown to the Chinese people, they are shipped to foreign countries every year and then spun into silk and sold to our country by other countries. It would shift the interests of the country, and the number would be uncountable, so it will be done to defend the leakage, which is the natural duty of the Chinese people. They decided to take the lead in the establishment of the nation's silk spinning factory in the branch of Jiaxing production of silk riding on top of the imported goods on the purchase of the country is close to the sale in the Nanyang Islands and India and other places to buy supply is heard in the government by the Ministry of Industry to find out that the company's silk production is indeed remarkable and necessary to be rewarded in accordance with the Special Industry Incentive Law.

<h3 id="e177">Great Chang Wheel Arbitration Stalled <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Letters from both sides. The issue of responsibility for the sinking of the Da Chang wheel by a collision is still awaiting the organization of an arbitration committee. However, the customs house, due to the obstruction of navigation caused by the sunken Da Chang wheel, is paying for the salvage at a cost of 77,000 yen per day, equivalent to more than 150,000 yuan in Chinese currency. The Da Hua Company, due to the relationship of arbitration responsibility, requires the customs house to temporarily suspend the salvage in order to avoid the obscuring of the real evidence. The customs house then asked experts to draw a picture of the accident for use as a basis for negotiation, but the Ping An Company opposed the invitation of experts as members of the organization of the arbitration committee, resulting in delays. The Da Chang Company specially wrote to the Shipping Association requesting fair handling. The Ping An's reply and the original letter from Da Chang to the Shanghai Shipping Association are recorded separately below. Ping An's reply states: "In response to your company's letter of the 8th of this month, we have learned that the explanation given in our company's previous letter regarding the identity of the representative was only for fear that one party might not understand it, so we stated it in advance to avoid misunderstandings from occurring at the last minute. Moreover, the most important staff member of the company is the manager, so asking the manager to attend in person is to show solemnity and is not intended to be a restriction. Now, after reading your letter, the interpretation of the representative is contrary to our company's opinion, and even changed the original agreement. In addition to wanting to appoint a representative other than the company's legal representative, it is also proposed to appoint a consultant lawyer. Our company finds it difficult to agree to this new proposal and hopes that the conditions will still be discussed and agreed upon in accordance with the original agreement and our company's previous letter. If there are any further changes, our company will not be responsible for the delay." Da Chang's letter to the Association reads: "Respectfully, the Da Chang wheel of our company was sunk by a collision, and the Ping An Company has long agreed that both parties should send responsible representatives to the Association to agree on an arbitration contract. It is found that the selection of this representative is the absolute freedom of each party, and the only requirement is that the person is competent and responsible. The Ping An Company has misinterpreted, far-fetched, and forcefully expressed its opinion. He suddenly sent a letter stating that the representatives of both parties are limited to managers. Our company replied with a letter detailing the reasons and interests, and argued that the issue of representatives is not limited to managers and that both parties should each send two representatives and one legal advisor to attend the meeting to sign the contract. After the reply, it was said that it had already admitted that the previous letter had been interpreted for the identity of the representative as a prior statement, and suddenly pointed out that our company's proposal was a change to the original agreement, and finally claimed that it was difficult to agree to this new proposal. The words are flickering and full of contradictions. After an investigation, there were only agreements on sending responsible representatives in the previous letters between the two parties, and there was absolutely no motion on whether the representatives were limited to managers and how many representatives there should be. The Ping An Company falsely claims to have changed the original agreement. If you mean that the Ping An's previous letter is considered to be the original agreement, then it is close to coercion and as arbitrary. And since it has repeatedly admitted that the interpretation is said to be an explanation, it is said to be a statement, can this kind of interpretation and statement be referred to as the original agreement between the two parties, which suddenly claims to be this new proposal. It seems that dreaming in such dreams and being engaged in business in advance will make our company unable to find a solution. The matter has to be respectfully sent to you for inspection. We have always looked up to your society as our industry's teacher, and we must have excellent insights and knowledge. We respectfully request that you evaluate our company's proposal. If you think it is meaningful, please forward the letter to the Ping An Company to persuade them to accept it. Otherwise, after the examination, the meeting will give a quantitative modification in order to make it as perfect as possible. It is also only to be ordered to pray for guidance."</p>

<p>Approximately Ten Thousand Guests and Customers Attended. Yesterday (the 22nd) was the day the Shanghai Bank moved into its new building. At 7:45 a.m., Chairman Zhuang Dezhi and General Manager Chen Guangfu first arrived at the old bank and led all the staff, numbering several hundred, to the new bank to begin operations. The chairman conducted the opening ceremony, and then everyone entered in an orderly fashion. After the bank began operations, it dispatched many receptionists to the upper and lower floors to receive guests and guide customers. Many customers were unfamiliar with the location of various departments on the first day in the new building and were at a loss. With the sincere guidance of the receptionists, everyone left satisfied. The chairman, general manager, and other important staff also received guests all day with great humility. Guests came in an endless stream that day, and there were even more customers. Over ten thousand people came in one day. Fortunately, the bank did not send out invitations, otherwise, even though the new building is large, it would have been overcrowded. Also, the bank was completely open that day, including the vault and safe deposit boxes, which were open for viewing. In addition, the office area and the second and third floors were also open for inspection. Many guests praised the vacuum tubes and automatic elevators for delivering transfer slips, as well as the automatic cash transport machine.</p>

<p>The case of the China Merchants Bureau's Xin Kang steamer being sunk by the Japanese ship Ryuya Maru has been ongoing for nearly two years with no progress in negotiations. After the bereaved family association hired Wu Jingxiong and Sheng Zhenwei as legal counsel and litigation agents, all legal matters were fully prepared by the two lawyers. However, due to the large number of bereaved family members and their different places of origin, the procedures for entrusting the lawyers were delayed and could not be completed. As a result, the litigation has not made active progress. Recently, the bereaved family association published an advertisement to notify families who have moved or whose whereabouts are unknown to report to the association within a deadline. In recent days, the families have been reporting to the association one after another. There are a total of 205 victims, all of whom have signed letters of authorization entrusting the two lawyers to immediately file a lawsuit in the Shanghai Special District Court to request a judgment ordering compensation for damages. The bereaved family association has held many meetings to discuss all proceedings and has made concrete decisions. In recent days, they have been extremely busy handling various matters. It is said that the two lawyers are determined to fight for the case in accordance with the law because it concerns national rights and the lives of the people. The resolution of this long-dormant case is not far off.</p>

It has now received a permit issued by the Municipal Civilian Training Association and is actively preparing to convene a general meeting to re-elect staff in order to improve medical development and association affairs.</p>

<p>Bandit Leaders Li Zhengpeng and Liu Shoushan</p>
<p>Female Hostage and Young Hostage Rescued. The Municipal Public Security Bureau's detective team cracked a major kidnapping case yesterday in Rongfuli, Gansi East Road, Xixiansi Road, French Concession, in which the victims were kidnapped from Wuxing County and hidden in Shanghai. A total of five male and female kidnappers were arrested, and one adult female hostage and one young child hostage were rescued on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e186">Secret Tip-Off Leads to Arrest <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Lu Ying, captain of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's detective team, received a secret tip-off the day before yesterday (the 21st) stating that the notorious kidnappers Li Zhengpeng, Liu Shoushan, and Tang Zuo were responsible for kidnapping several hostages from the countryside in Wuxing County around February of this year. They had traveled by waterway via Taihu Lake to Shanghai and were currently hiding with the hostages at No. 17 Rongfuli, Gansi East Road, Xixiansi Road, French Concession. The tipster urged the team to dispatch officers immediately to arrest them and prevent them from escaping. Upon receiving the report, Captain Lu personally led team leader Shan Bin, Qi Haitian, detectives Chen Caifu, Yang Gussen, Zhou Peisan, Li Xiaobao, Shen Ruifu, Ling Tianpeng, Zhang Ruizhi, Deng Qishan, Zhang Yingpin, Wu Kezhong, Han Jingxiang, Liu Enyu, Xuanyuan Zhong, secret agents Shen Wenda, Zhao Huairen, and others, along with the informant, in several cars around 10 p.m. the previous evening.</p>

<p>Captain Lu and his large group of detectives first went to the special agency of the French Concession police station, where they met with Western detective Bardi and Chinese and Western police officers. They proceeded to the address, but the bandits had already fled after hearing the news. However, all the items in the house had not yet been moved, so it was assumed that they had not gone far. Detective Zhang Ruizhi was assigned to wait in the house and questioned the landlord, Mr. Cai, who said that they had indeed left not long ago. Captain Lu ordered detectives Shen Wenda and Shen Ruifu to lie in wait at another location used by the bandits, No. 18 Zhenxingfang, on the same road.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Female Hostage Identifies Kidnappers <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>At around 6 a.m. yesterday, a man and a woman suddenly appeared at No. 17 Rongfuli. Upon seeing the detectives, they looked panicked. The man turned around and ran away. Detective Zhang Ruizhi ordered someone to guard the woman while he chased after the fleeing man. He pursued the man all the way to Remi Road, where he joined forces with the local police to intercept him. He was taken to No. 17, where the landlord identified him as the person who had come to rent the house. The arrested woman claimed that she was a hostage kidnapped from Wuxing, and the arrested man was one of the bandits, Liu Shoushan.</p>

<p>Detective Zhang then brought the two to Captain Lu for questioning. The female hostage stated her name was Zhang Shen, 23 years old, and she lived in Siqian Village outside the South Gate of Wuxing County. Her husband, Zhang Aman (25 years old), was a farmer. The family had a few acres of land, barely enough to make ends meet. In February of this year, she went to her mother's home in Shenjiahui, Wuxing, to visit her parents and her elder brother and sister-in-law. Her brother's name was A Long (26 years old), and his family also had good land and some savings. This time, the bandits had a dispute with A Long and intended to kidnap his wife, but she happened to be attending a gathering in a neighboring village, so they kidnapped me, my seven-year-old nephew Changshan, and my four-month-old baby.</p>

<p>After we were kidnapped, we first traveled by boat through Taihu Lake for two months. We finally arrived in Shanghai on April 22. The bandits initially demanded 1,500 yuan from my brother, promising to release all three of us. Unexpectedly, after my brother paid the bandits 1,500 yuan, they only released my nephew Changshan, and I and the baby continued to live in the bandits' den. Now, the bandits plan to extort a higher price from my husband's family, but my husband's family is very poor and cannot afford it, so they have no choice but to ignore it and leave it to fate.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Liu Shoushan Reveals Young Hostage <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Upon questioning, the bandit Liu Shoushan stated that he was 48 years old, from Shandong, and worked as a cart pusher. He also revealed that there was a four-month-old hostage hidden in Room 6 of the Shunhe Hotel on Beile Road, Xujiahui, and he also revealed the location of his accomplices. Captain Lu ordered the original detectives to rush to Room 6 of the Shunhe Hotel, rescue the young hostage, and arrest the female bandit Zhang Wang, who was guarding the hostage. According to the hotel clerk, the bandits had rented six rooms: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. While the team was interrogating them, the three bandits Tang Zuo, Li Zhengpeng, and Geng Fusheng were simultaneously apprehended at another bandit den at No. 18 Zhenxingli, Gansi East Road.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Director Chen Rewards Meritorious Service <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The three newly captured bandits were interrogated strictly. Li Zhengpeng was the leader of the bandits, 57 years old, from Ningguo, Anhui. Tang Zuo stated that he was 33 years old, from Anhui. The female bandit Zhang Wang was 28 years old, from Shaoxing. The most surprising thing was that a Detective Symbol No. 92 of the Second District of the Zhejiang Inland River Water Police Bureau was found on the bandit Geng Fusheng. Geng claimed that he was 29 years old, from Guangshou, Henan, and had been working as a detective in the Water Police Bureau for only five days. After questioning, Captain Lu immediately reported the situation to Director Chen. Director Chen was very pleased and immediately approved a commendation for Captain Lu, noting a major merit. Team leader Shan Bin and Detective Zhang Ruizhi were each noted with one merit, and the remaining fourteen detectives, including Chen Caifu, were commended in advance and would be rewarded after the case was tried and judged. It is reported that Director Chen has specially dispatched officers to Wuxing County to notify the hostage families to come to Shanghai to identify them so that they can be reunited with their families as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Rescues Three Male and Female Hostages. The Gujia Town (formerly Gujiazai) militia, located in Baoshan County, cracked a bandit ship around 9 p.m. the night before last near the Yunzaobang Tang Bridge, about two miles east of the town. At that time, two bandits were captured, and three male and female hostages were rescued. The next morning, another accomplice bandit was captured and escorted to the Baoshan County government for interrogation. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Process of Cracking the Bandit Ship <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Around 9 p.m. the night before last, militia chief Shen, deputy chief Gu, and Jia chiefs Li and Wang received a phone call from the Dachang militia reporting that a bandit ship with a pointed bow and copper railings had sailed towards Tang Bridge and requesting an immediate investigation. After receiving the report, the militia immediately ordered the platoon leaders to lead the militia members, led by the chief, deputy chief, and Jia chiefs, to set out in shifts to investigate. Near Tang Bridge, they saw a Jiangbei thatched boat parked in the river (this was another bandit ship, not the one with copper railings). They called out to it, but there was no response. The militia members became even more suspicious and fired several warning shots. A bandit peeked out and told the militia members that there was a patient on board. Then, a male hostage also peeked out and said, "I'm sick, I'm sick!" However, he kept gesturing to the militia members with his hands, so the militia members knew something was wrong and ordered him to come closer. They immediately boarded the ship and found two female hostages in the stern cabin. After questioning, they confirmed that they were kidnapped and rescued the three male and female hostages, along with the two bandits on board, and took them to the district militia.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Statements of Male and Female Hostages <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The male hostage, Wu Songqin, 47 years old, from Qingpu County, a farmer, stated that he was kidnapped on the evening of the ninth day of the lunar month. His body was covered in cuts and bruises, and his hands and feet were tied with hemp rope, which may have caused permanent damage. He said that he tried to escape somewhere and jumped into the river, but the bandits noticed and dragged him up and beat him, so he was covered in mud. The militia provided him with newly made short shirts and trousers and ordered him to change. One of the female hostages was Xu Wu, 33 years old, whose husband's name was Xu Liukui, living in Zhangpu, Kunshan. The other female hostage, Yueqin, was Wu's daughter, 16 years old. Wu took Yueqin back to her mother's home in Shipu on the evening of the ninth day of the lunar month and was kidnapped by bandits. At the same time, Wu's cousin, Wu Xuezhou, was also kidnapped by bandits. However, Xuezhou was redeemed for 3,000 yuan at the end of April and is now overseas. The bandits want her and her daughter to pay 17,000 yuan to be redeemed.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Confessions of Bandits <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>One bandit, Tang Shaolian (aka A Da), 32 years old, a road worker, stated that Xue Renjie, Jiang Asan, Wu Asi, etc., had hired him to be a kidnapper. Xue Renjie is an old bandit with many handguns and submachine guns. He must go to Kunshan tomorrow (i.e., yesterday) wearing a black silk long shirt. He is a large man with pockmarks on his face. There is a Sanfengyuan teahouse inside the white powder wall at No. 7, west of the Zhonghua Paint Factory in Tanzikou, Zhabei, Shanghai. Zhou Ermazi, A Xiang, Wang Jinzhao, Xue San, etc., are all old bandits and live in Liudaoai, Yijiaojiao, near the Sun Temple (aka Xiao Erzi), 27 years old, a rickshaw puller, living in a straw shed behind the Fuxing Flour Mill in Xiaoshadu, Zhabei, along with Xue Renjie, Gao Laoda, A Er, Wang Youfa, Du Xiaosanzi, etc., more than 20 people. They all meet in the small teahouse in Tanzikou. I have only done this business twice. Last time, we went to Shihetang, Jiaxing, with 40 people and kidnapped three men and one woman and hid them in the west end of Caojiadu. One man was redeemed for 2,500 yuan overseas in December last year. There are more than 30 firearms. The newly captured bandit, Yan Zhiqing (aka Yan Asi), 29 years old (the above three bandits are all from Yancheng), came to look for the ship today and was arrested. There are five people on the ship. He also hired Xue Renjie to do this business. Xue runs the Sanfengyuan teahouse and sells wine and cigarettes. He also provided the names of the accomplices on the ship and the hostages, which were all the same. He also said that in November last year, he did two kidnapping cases near Kunshan. One time, he received 2,000 yuan, and he received 100 yuan. The other time, he received 4,000 yuan, and he received 200 yuan. The first time, there were 31 people, and there were more than 10 firearms. Now, all the firearms are with Gao Laoye. This time (referring to the current case of the kidnapped men and women), Xue Renjie, Tang Youfa, Zhou Ermazi, A Er, A Da, Xue Acai, Gao Laoda, Xue Er, Xue San, Liu Xiao Erzi (i.e., Daoai), Tang Asan, Qu San, Gu Zhiqing, a total of 13 people, went together. After verifying the confession, the militia sent Tang Shaolian and Liu Daoai, who were captured the night before last, to the county government for trial, and Yan Zhiqing was also sent to the county government for joint trial. It is understood that the county government has issued an order to the families of the hostages Wu Songqin, Xu Wu, and Xu Yueqin to be returned to the militia to be claimed by their families, so they have sent people to notify the families of the hostages.</p>

<p>Doctors are Busy. Since the beginning of summer in this city, the weather has been abnormal, with clouds and rain one after another, and the temperature has been erratic. As a result, epidemics are prevalent. The health authorities are making every effort to carry out epidemic prevention work. In the Chinese area, doctors from the Health Bureau are leading students in teams to promote and inject preventive vaccines. In the concession area, health vehicles are also dispatched to various street corners to inject preventive vaccines for people, with hundreds of people being vaccinated every day. However, recently, the climate has been cold and hot, and residents are prone to infection if they are not careful about their diet and living habits. Wet-heat syndrome is the most common. Many children suffer from measles and chickenpox. Pediatricians and internists are very busy with outpatient and home visits.</p>

<p>Li Fengzhu vs. Wang Caiming</p>
<p>Mediation Fails, Lawsuit Filed. Wang Caiming, a native of Yongxingli 153, Yuezhou Road, married Li Fengzhu from the same hometown. However, their relationship was not harmonious, and they often quarreled. Two years ago, Li sued him for assault, and the court sentenced him to a fine of 30 yuan, suspending the sentence for two years due to his first offense. Since then, she has returned to her mother's home at 1045 Dingheli, Yangshupu Road, for two years. Wang has also not come to welcome her back. They are nominally husband and wife, but in reality, they are like strangers. Li is only 22 years old and still young. If this continues, the happiness of her youth will be sacrificed. Recently, she has resolutely advocated divorce to avoid wasting her life. She filed a lawsuit with the Special District Local Court, requesting a preliminary mediation, demanding that Wang repay the loss of dowry, etc., 3,258.7 yuan, and alimony of 15,000 yuan, and that the marital relationship be dissolved. The requested alimony is calculated at 40 yuan per month, from the age of 22 to 60. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren of the Special Court held a court session for mediation, but Wang Caiming did not attend. Lawyer Yan Hongshih represented him in court and said that Wang could agree to Li's request for divorce, but the amount of alimony she wanted was too large for Wang to afford. If it were 300 or 500 yuan, he could consider it. Li said that Wang had assets of more than 100,000 yuan and that the Yongxingli residence where she now lives is his property, and he can afford the amount she is asking for. Judge Zhou asked if she could compromise, but she firmly refused. On the other hand, he was unwilling to provide a large amount of money, so mediation could not be effective. Judge Zhou instructed them to withdraw and asked Li to formally file a lawsuit to await trial.</p>

<p>Wei Min, who was mentioned in yesterday's newspaper as having attempted suicide at the Wugong Inn, died in Renji Hospital after being sent there for treatment because he had taken too much poison and could not be saved. Wei was from Henan and had served as a county magistrate. After resigning, he brought his wife to Shanghai to find work but failed. He attempted suicide in Pudong. His weak wife and young children have already passed away, and now Wei has committed suicide and died, which is truly sad.</p>

<p>Kong Chengrong Dies Tragically Due to Affair. On the 15th of this month, a male corpse was found on the Xiaoshadu Railway, killed with many knife wounds and castration (i.e., genitals). The Local Court examined and buried the body. Now, Kong Arer from Haimen came to the hospital and claimed that the deceased, Kong Chengrong, 38 years old, who lived at 116 Haibaige Road, was his younger brother. He was killed in revenge because of an affair with a woman, but he himself did not know much about it. He requested to claim the body and seek justice. The request was approved by the judge.</p>

<p>Bean Loser is Suspected.</p>
<p>False Report by Landlord Detained. There is a Xiaohang in Yangjing East South, Pudong, which is a ditch shared by Chen Jinsheng and Xu Shunsheng for water use. The day before yesterday, a female corpse was found in the Hang. Wang Xiangchun, from Yancheng, went to identify the body and said that his wife, Zhou, 35 years old, had gone out to pick up firewood after lunch on the 17th of this month. The workers watching the corpse, Yang Nengxi and Xu Shaokui, suddenly said that the corpse was beaten to death for stealing beans. Wang Xiangchun was unwilling to give up after hearing this and filed a complaint with the Third District Police Station. The police were dispatched to investigate and found broad beans next to the corpse, which clearly indicated that beans had been stolen. Upon further investigation, it was found that Chen Jinsheng had beanstalks planted on his land. When asked, Chen Jinsheng admitted that he had a lot of broad beans stolen. However, the police did not know how the corpse died and how it was found. The police suspected that Chen Jinsheng and Shunsheng were involved and arrested them. Xu claimed that his family had not had any beans stolen and did not know where the corpse came from. Since Yang Nengxi and others had said that the deceased was beaten to death, they must know the reason, so they were also detained for questioning. They did not admit anything, so the 47th Tu landlord, Lu Jinquan, was ordered to report to the Local Court for examination. However, the landlord reported that she had drowned. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wu and examiners came to the scene to examine the corpse and found that the corpse had a fatal injury to the head and was thrown into the Hang after death. The Hang was only half a foot deep, so how could it drown someone? Therefore, he ordered the body to be buried, and the corpse's husband went to the station to accuse the landlord of concealing the matter for many days without reporting it. Therefore, the station detained the landlord and sent him to the Local Court for custody and investigation.</p>

<p>Yang Asan, from Jiangbei, has been making a living by rowing boats. His wife, Hu, 23 years old, is from the same hometown as Yang. The couple lives on the boat and makes a living by transporting light cargo. At noon yesterday, Yang first rowed the boat alone from Longmao Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, to Puxi.

<p>Abstract Translation of the Fourth and Fifth Sections: The current governing system of the Public Concession, established according to the Land Regulations, is a most direct form of democracy, as stated above. The participation of Chinese people in the representative system of the Public Concession is still in its infancy. The considerations mentioned above indicate that, from the perspective of public interest, it would be unfair to Chinese society to suddenly have Chinese representatives assume the majority of responsibilities in the existing administrative system of the Public Concession. Chinese voters must have adequate opportunities to become familiar with public elections and discover the best methods of election. Both voters and representatives must also have opportunities to learn more about the nature of the work undertaken by the board of directors and the relationship of individual elected officials to the members of a public body. The special nature and value of the Public Concession's administration come from inherited customs and standards. If these customs and standards are to be preserved, then the responsibility for all major positions in the Public Concession service must be transferred from foreign directors to Chinese directors slowly and gradually. The renowned writer John Stuart Mill said, "The nature and extent of the authority exercised over the individual, the distribution of powers, and the conditions of commanding and obeying are the most powerful of all influences. Except for the individual's religious beliefs, only these influences can create the individual as he is now and make him what he can become." If this statement is true, then when a people begin to participate in a representative system they have never fully experienced, they must be given time for this system to exert its influence as "a great force influencing human thought." Only then can the new participants be prepared to take over this representative system. Based on the above reasons, I have concluded that the number of Chinese directors should not be increased to the point where they constitute a majority on the board. I also do not believe it is appropriate to increase the number of Chinese directors to be nearly equal to the number of foreign directors. Such a method may give rise to power struggles and, as can be imagined, may even open up paths to undesirable conspiracies. However, if the total number of board members is increased according to the following recommendations, then I believe that the number of Chinese directors should be increased such that: (a) in terms of the proportion of the total number of directors, the proportion of Chinese directors in the future should not be less than the current proportion of Chinese directors; (b) the number of Chinese directors may be greater than the number of directors of any other nationality. Adopting this distribution basis means that the number of Chinese directors will always be more than one-third of the total number of directors on the board. Although the portion of the residents of the Public Concession represented by Chinese directors is far larger than other parts, Chinese directors still constitute a minority on the board. In this regard, whether any special provisions are necessary to clearly protect the interests of the Chinese people is a question to be considered separately. The main goals that should always be kept in mind for any plan to reform the existing Public Concession organization law are as follows: (1) So-called international cooperation refers to (a) cooperation between Chinese and foreigners, and (b) cooperation between representatives of various nationalities that make up the foreign community. To expand the foundation of international cooperation on which the Public Concession governance system relies and to increase its strength, and to establish a suitable organizational function for this expansion and increase in strength. (2) To define all general powers possessed by the Public Concession's governing body, the Shanghai Municipal Council, in wording that allows these powers to be exercised effectively and without doubt within its scope, thereby eliminating all causes of conflict and facilitating cooperation between the Municipal Council and the Chinese authorities. (3) To ensure that any method or limit of constitutional change is suitable for the protection of the principles of autonomy and rule of law on which the current governing system of the Public Concession is based, and suitable for maintaining and improving the general standards of administrative efficiency of the Public Concession, with particular attention to the security of Chinese and foreign residents or merchants within the Public Concession. (4) To adopt more effective methods of publication so that an enlightened public opinion can develop throughout the society of the Public Concession. The basis of this public opinion is twofold: on the one hand, a clear understanding of the common interests and responsibilities of the residents of all countries that make up the Public Concession, and on the other hand, a better understanding of the scope and nature of the tasks and capabilities of the Municipal Council, the governing body of the Public Concession. In this way, the Municipal Council can more fully rely on the practical assistance of all parts of the population when exercising its powers in a clear and decisive manner. Regarding the reform plans for the Ratepayers' Meeting and the Shanghai Municipal Council, the following recommendations are made: 1. The Ratepayers' Meeting should hold two types of Ratepayers' Meetings, one representing foreign ratepayers and one representing Chinese ratepayers, to replace the foreign ratepayers' annual meeting stipulated in Articles 9 and 19 of the Land Regulations. All proposals submitted to the foreign ratepayers' annual meeting for deliberation according to existing regulations should be submitted separately to the Chinese and foreign Ratepayers' Meetings for decision. If a special motion is adopted by both meetings, then their joint resolution will take effect. However, if the resolutions of the two Ratepayers' Meetings differ, then the resolutions of both parties should only be regarded as a kind of consultative nature. The decision should be referred to the board of directors, but the board of directors must review the issue again in accordance with the proceedings of the two meetings and their decisions before making a final decision. For example, if the budget is passed by both the Chinese and foreign Ratepayers' Meetings as proposed, or if it is passed by both meetings with the same restrictions, then the budget passed in this way will be the final budget. However, if one meeting passes a proposal to increase or decrease expenditure that is rejected by the other meeting, then whether the expenditure should be increased or decreased should be decided by the board of directors with reference to the discussions and decisions of the two meetings. The same method applies to proposals for levying taxes. Before adopting a plan to establish a foreign ratepayers' representative body to replace the existing foreign ratepayers' meeting, the foreign ratepayers' meeting should still be a general meeting that all foreigners who meet the qualifications stipulated in the existing Land Regulations can attend. Any such plan that is not included in the Land Regulations should first be submitted by the board of directors to the foreign ratepayers' meeting for deliberation and then implemented. The Chinese Ratepayers' Meeting is a meeting of a representative body. The election of this representative body should be conducted in accordance with a plan proposed by the Chinese directors and approved by the board of directors. The above recommendations, except where the same proposal is unanimously passed by both the Chinese and foreign Ratepayers' Meetings, should only be regarded as a kind of consultative nature. This recommendation is subject to the following restriction: the Shanghai Municipal Council shall not increase taxes (especially land tax and house tax) beyond a certain standard without first obtaining the consent of both Ratepayers' Meetings. Any tax increase proposal exceeding this standard may be vetoed by both Ratepayers' Meetings. However, this restriction should not be worded in such a way that the Shanghai Municipal Council is not allowed to implement any tax increase exceeding the current standard without the consent of both Ratepayers' Meetings. More room for increase should be left above the current tax rates. The election of auditors and property committee members by both Ratepayers' Meetings has also been discussed and recommended. These personnel should be elected separately by the two Ratepayers' Meetings. 2. The power to make by-laws should belong to the board of directors in the future, not to special meetings of taxpayers. The quorum for this meeting is stipulated in Article 11 of the Land Regulations. However, three months before the Shanghai Municipal Council makes any by-laws, it should publish the proposed by-laws in the Municipal Council Gazette so that those who oppose their implementation have ample opportunity to make representations. 3. Increase the number of directors to expand the board of directors so that all directors are at least twenty-two and no more than thirty. The number of directors may be increased in stages. The first stage should increase to twenty-two, and then continue to increase. If all Chinese directors are increased in this way, as mentioned above, then the proportion of Chinese directors should not be less than the current proportion of Chinese directors in terms of the proportion of the total number of directors, and the number of Chinese directors may be greater than the number of directors of any other nationality. 4. Electoral Law (a) Foreign Directors: For foreign directors, the current electoral system must be modified to provide that two different electoral laws will be adopted in the future. Some foreign directors will be elected by individual foreign taxpayers as they are now. Some will be elected by chambers of commerce or other similar bodies representing foreign nationalities. However, how the foreign directors elected by the proposed chambers of commerce or other national bodies represent each nationality should be specified. As for the directors elected by foreign taxpayers, it should also be stipulated that each of the three foreign countries represented by the current directors of the board must retain a certain number of seats. (b) Chinese Directors: The method of electing Chinese directors is the same as the method of electing foreign directors. That is, when a public election system can be adopted, some Chinese directors should be elected by individual Chinese taxpayers, and some should be elected by Chinese bodies. However, before a public election method for Chinese directors can be adopted, the method of election by Chinese bodies should continue to be handled by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association or other appropriate bodies. However, it should be amended when it is deemed appropriate to ensure that all elected Chinese directors can include the Chinese directors who can be elected in the last public election. The reasons for the third recommendation to increase the number of directors and the fourth recommendation to change the electoral method have been explained and instructed as follows: Now that the board of directors has been granted broader and more independent powers, including legislative powers, the number of directors should be increased in order to enable the council to more fully represent the entire body of residents.</p>

<p>The teachers at a school in Dumfries, England, noting the students' enthusiasm for watching movies, posed a question to them asking what kind of movies they liked to watch. Ninety-eight percent of the male students replied that they liked watching romance movies. Ninety-four percent of the female students replied that they liked watching military murder cases, struggles, and the like.</p>
<p>Houses Deep Underground</p>
<p>American houses strive to be tall and reach the sky, while Japanese houses strive to be deep underground. Why do they want to go deep underground? Because there are too many earthquakes. It is said that in the center of Tokyo, there are plans to build such a deep house, going eighty stories deep underground and capable of being added to at any time as needed. It will be made entirely of steel, reinforced concrete, and stone, forming a cylindrical shape 155 feet in diameter and 1,100 feet deep, with a circular ventilation tunnel 75 feet in diameter running straight through the house to eliminate any stuffiness. All modern equipment such as electric lights, telephones, radios, elevators, and sunlight reflectors will be fully equipped. It is said that the construction time will be half of what it would take to build a 50-story building, and the construction cost will be approximately 2.5 million pounds. If this plan is realized, then no matter how severe the earthquake in Tokyo, this house will be unaffected.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Remembering Dr. Richard Wilhelm, Famous German Sinologist <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>Since Western material civilization has surged eastward, our countrymen have tended towards industrialization and mechanization, discarding national traditions and abandoning our inherent civilization. They have failed to understand that spiritual and material things must be balanced. Deformed development only increases harm. Germany has long been known for its scientific achievements and holds a leading position in the world. Recently, with overproduction and worker unemployment, it is about to lead to a trend where humanity is driven and oppressed by material things, gradually evolving into a situation of overthrow, collapse, and terror. Scholars across the country advocate introducing Eastern civilization to correct this drawback. However, Sinology is difficult and different from Latin. Without a special research institution, it would be impossible to gain insight into its depths.</p>
<p>This spring, I traveled to Frankfurt, Germany, on business and had the opportunity to visit the local Chinese Academy. I learned about the spirit of Dr. Richard Wilhelm, the former president of the academy, in his study of Sinology and the regret after his death. Therefore, I record his biography to warn those in our country who dabble in Western learning while abandoning national traditions.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilhelm was born in 1873 and died at the age of 57. He graduated from the University of Tübingen and the Stift Theological Seminary. He lived in China for 25 years, serving as a pastor in Qingdao, running schools and hospitals, and passionately pursuing Sinology. He associated with Gu Hongming, Kang Nanhai, Liang Rengong, and others. He once served as a professor at Peking University and wrote extensively. He translated the Analects, Mencius, the Tao Te Ching, the Liezi, the Zhuangzi, and other books into German, and wrote "The Soul of China" (Die Seele Chinas), elucidating the inherent civilization of the East and his personal views on China in order to introduce it to German youth and correct European misconceptions about China. This had a huge impact. Today, major universities in various German cities have added Chinese language departments, and the Dr. was an influential figure for this.</p>
<p>In 1924, Dr. Wilhelm was hired by the University of Frankfurt to lecture on the origin of Chinese characters and Chinese culture. At the same time, he founded the Chinese Academy to provide Germans with the opportunity to study Sinology in depth. He wrote "A History of Chinese Literature," "A History of Chinese Philosophy," and "A History of Chinese Culture," and traveled throughout Europe lecturing on Chinese cultural issues. The academy invited Chinese scholars to give lectures, including Dr. Hu Shih.</p>
<p>Due to overwork, Dr. Wilhelm died of illness in Frankfurt on March 6, 1930. His wife, Mrs. BlueHart, bore him four children. She was gentle and virtuous. Dr. Wilhelm's last major work, "Chinese Religion and Philosophy," was not completed. However, although Dr. Wilhelm passed away, his special spirit has permeated throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Among the Westerners who have traveled to China and studied Sinology extensively, the one I know is the late American Dr. Li Jiabai, who lived in Shanghai for nearly 30 years and founded the Shangxian Hall on Songshan Road to engage in charitable undertakings. He associated with famous scholars in the country and translated and wrote extensively, also composing poetry and lyrics, which were remarkable and unique in style. Unfortunately, I am forgetful and cannot recall the successive passing of those great talents. It is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3 id="e217">In early summer of the year Xinwei (1931), Elder Sun Shoushi and Elder Yao Jinqiu invited the poets of the Mingshe for a tour of Mount Zhidou. The pomegranate flowers were in full bloom, tens of thousands of them stretching for four or five li, creating a magnificent spectacle. I wrote a long poem to commemorate it. <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhian</p>
<p>The flower season in Jiangnan in April is over, and searching for flowers only brings thoughts of spring. Going out for a tour feels lost, as if something is missing. What shall we do with wine? We specially go through the prefectural government to Mount Zhidou. The path is narrow and the carriage struggles. How do we know there is another world, where the peaks turn and the heart opens? The fire on the branches is first seen, and the red flowers are enough to delight the eyes. In an instant, the prairie fire spreads, blazing and boundless, how can it be exhausted? Three or five li, all are red. Thousands and thousands of trees are coral red. Who got the excellent varieties of the forest and planted them here? Don't say this color is empty, don't say that city is a torch, the ashes have not died, flying into the empty valley, still raging. It's like the evening glow of Chicheng rising, its splendor stretching across the sky, baking the great river and overturning the father's shadow, as if a winding dragon is coming to light the way. The red frost has not melted, spewing out wild floods, the empty mountain turns over the south wind morning and evening. Leaning on the wind, I want to shout "stone vinegar, stone vinegar!" What is the joy here like? In the ten thousand greens, a red spot, Jinggong already praised it back then. Moreover, looking at the red road, the carriages are like fish entering it. Looking at the flowers, we do not think of attaching to the heat. How do we know the sorrows of the mountain? There is such happiness in the world, is it the same as the Peach Blossom Spring? If we are written into a picture, the flushed faces should be thicker than the mountain mist. The pomegranate fields have long been famous because of Fan Xie's writing, truly human effort is not the work of nature. Who gave a branch to Lanqi? For no reason, I think of Mount Dong.</p>
<h3 id="e218">A Record of Shi Guzi's Painting of Horses <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Shi Guzi's painting of horses is a long scroll on silk, ten and a half inches high and one hundred and ninety-eight inches long. On the right end, there are two large trees and four small trees extending horizontally. Behind them are many slender bamboos along the shore. Across the bank are seven or eight small stones. A horse stands to the left of the trees, raising its foot as if to walk. To the left of the horse, there is another clump of trees covering the river surface. Further to the left, the water ripples gently. A horse crouches in an open area, gnawing at its hooves. Across the bank, there is a continent with five trees, only their roots visible. Then three trees with only half their trunks showing, and a short tree like a child reaching under an adult's armpit, stretching its head out. Reeds and rushes grow far and near along the water's edge. There is another horse turning its head to the right, looking back while gnawing at its hooves. Beside it, there is a herd of horses. One horse stands facing left, one horse behind it wanting to come forward, and one horse stands forward. There is another horse standing sideways. Further to the left, a person is pulling a horse across the river, but the horse refuses to move, raising its front hooves to kick. The person is about five or six feet away from the horse, and the water reaches his shins. At this point, the land ends, and the water gradually widens. There are only eight or nine old tree roots along the bank, and a dozen or so scattered stones by the water's edge. The ripples are like scattered water, with shimmering reflections. Two people each sit on a horse halfway across the river. The former reins in his horse to stop and talk, while the latter leans forward, tilting his ear to listen. Further to the left, one horse has both feet on land and is starting to rise. Slightly further away, a person is scooping water to wash a horse. Another horse is also in the water, as if it has already been washed. On the bank, there is a horse sitting and stretching. Slightly past two large trees, one covered in dense dead vines, and the other behind, there is a rocky cliff where the water reaches. Under the trees, two horses squat, one facing the trees and looking left. The eyes of the two horses are each focused. To the left of the trees, one horse lies on the ground rolling, its belly facing up and all four feet raised. A horse stands beside it, as if lost in thought. Another horse bows its head, gnawing at its shin. Two horses sit on the left and right of the trees. The horse on the right sits with its back facing the trees. Slightly forward, a horse is leaping. Another herd of horses is walking under pine trees. One horse is gnawing at its horseshoe, one horse leans its head on the pine tree to rub, one horse follows behind it, and one horse has already turned around, still looking forward. Two horses bow their heads, wanting to eat grass. A young horse follows at the end. Beside the pines, there are three other horses, one standing tall, one rubbing its neck, and one bowing its head to look down. There is another horse standing separately under a pine tree. Further to the left, one horse turns its head to play with its tail. Two horses walk to the right, side by side, talking to each other. Behind them, there is a small stream with three bends, the spring flowing continuously. From there to the end, a level slope can be seen. In the distance, slender bamboos are planted densely. Nearby, there are two or three large stones with several clumps of bamboo growing on them. There are several lines of geese flying from the left. Inscribed on the painting: "In the winter month of Wuzi, imitating the brushstrokes of Zhao Jixian, painted by Wang Hui, Shigu Zi of Yushan." Seals with the red characters "Wang Hui zhi Yin" (Seal of Wang Hui). In total, there are four people and thirty-seven horses, all painted in color with meticulous brushstrokes. According to Shigu, his other name is Gengyan, and he is as famous as Lutai and Yuanzhao, known as the "Four Wangs." He excels at painting landscapes. His works include "Peach Blossom Spring," "Autumn Colors of Dongting," "Bamboo Forest Fishing Village," "Cloud Emerging," "Empty Smoke," "Lin'an Mountain Scenery," "Yushan Jianmen Pass," "River and Sky Pavilion," "Taibai Watching the Spring," "Yunxi High Hermit," "Stream and Mountain Clearing Snow," "Autumn Mountain Thatched Hall," "Fuchun," and "Stream Pasture." Lifelike works are very rare. Could it be that he saw Wenmin's authentic work and then exerted himself to create it? The seller asked for six hundred gold pieces for this scroll. After returning it, I recorded its general appearance in this way to inform those who love antiquity.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Idle Talk on Storytelling <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Qingnan</p>
<p>For the past decade, storytellers from all over with a little bit of talent have gathered in Shanghai and lingered, not only those famous storytellers from the towns and villages of Songjiang, Taicang, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but also those who fill the ranks of the Guangyu Society's hometown of Suzhou. Therefore, this year, Xia Hesheng, a member of the society who defected, performs in Suzhou, singing during the day on Lindun Road and at night in the Maoyuan in West City. At the beginning of his storytelling, he had more than four hundred listeners day and night, even with rumors that he made one thousand four or five hundred listeners. And the Maoyuan wall has crumbled under the squeeze; these rumors are all unfounded. It's like the saying "There are no great generals in Shu, so Liao Hua is the vanguard." How long ago it seemed like a flash of lightning, a moment of brilliance before extinguishing. Recently, when I went to Maoyuan again, I saw that the storyteller on the stage was still Xia Hesheng, but there were only seventy listeners below the stage. I was very surprised at the rise and fall of the storytelling career. There is so-called "momentum" and "tail end," but I have never seen such a disparity. I then studied with the old listeners. The main reason is that Xia's art has not yet reached a perfect state, so he lacks a lasting appeal. Secondly, the listeners at Xia's most prosperous time were mostly people of the opposite sex and from the lower and middle classes, with impure character. Once they encountered wind, rain, or obstacles, or the story's cliffhanger was declared a pause, the audience stopped coming and never recovered. It could not be like Zhang Buyun, He Yunfei, etc., who were successful and failed three times. The more the story went on, the more crowded the audience became. I don't know if Xia has also been guilty of divine intent, storing his mind to practice hard and strive to follow in Zhang and He's footsteps, hoping to wash away the shame of this uneven beginning and end. Li Bokang, a member of the Runyu Society in Shanghai, who sings Yang Naiwu, is also one of the most popular storytellers in recent years, because his unique ability to tell the strange story can be done by only one person and there is no split. His father, Li Wenbin, not only spoke with a strong Zhejiang accent, but also could not play the stringed instrument. Some people gave him the eight-character rating of "unpleasant appearance, tasteless language," but he still managed to win the favor of some people with this book. At that time, the Mao'er Opera troupe of the Qunxian Tea Garden immediately hired someone to introduce them and spent some money to buy his plot to compose and perform a new fashion opera, let alone the current Bokang, whose accent is flawed but much better than his father, and his singing can also be called above average. Naturally, his career is booming and he is carrying glory everywhere. However, the listeners that Bokang attracts suffer from the same problems as Xia Hesheng in Suzhou. In addition, he himself can only perform the roles of young men and women. When it comes to people in the latter part of the book, such as Xia Tongshan and Yang Changjun, their square robes and large sleeves, and the righteous men of Huang Jinman, their accents are either vulgar and uneducated or their behavior is rude, and they are not accepted by connoisseurs.</p>
<p>Note: There is still a section of this report that was mistakenly typeset after the "Mongolian and Manchu Gossip Record" in yesterday's newspaper (that is, the section about being able to compete with Li Bokang in recent years). Therefore, because this article was typeset at the same time, this section was mistakenly attached after the "Mongolian and Manchu Gossip Record." This is a special correction.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>(8) No More Sour Plum Drink</p>
<p>A week later, the policeman was indeed promoted to sergeant. Not knowing why Division Commander Zhang had promoted him, he took some time to come to the Division Commander Zhang's mansion on Nongshangbu Street to thank him in person. It was May again, and the locust trees in the whole alley were growing lush and green. The sun shone on the treetops, scattering green shade all over the ground. A sour plum drink seller, carrying his load, walked into the small alley next to him under the green shade. Reaching a white powder wall in the small alley, he rested his load again. Behind the white powder wall was a red building. Beneath the red building was a grape trellis, and Zhang Xiaosan's second concubine was sitting in a rattan chair under the grape trellis, enjoying the cool air. Zhang Xiaosan, dressed in silk clothes, also sat beside her, joking with the concubine. Suddenly, a shout arose from outside the wall. The voice first said a Beijing phrase, "Drink up!" Then it sang, "Osmanthus sugar, a lot of it, sweet and cool and delicious!" Finally, it added another Beijing phrase, "Drink up!" The second concubine smiled and said, "I heard that Beijing's sour plum drink is delicious. Let me try it." Zhang Xiaosan said, "The famous sour plum drink in Beijing isn't sold at the door. It's Xin Yuan Qi's from Changdian. They boil whole vats of it the year before and bury it in the soil to get through the winter. You can buy a small bottle for a dollar. If you want to drink it, I'll have someone buy a bottle. You can't drink what's sold at the door. Who knows what kind of water they boil it with? The black sugar and ice cubes are捞ed from the moat in the winter. It's full of feces and urine. You're sure to get diarrhea if you eat it." As he spoke, the shouting rose again outside the wall, "Osmanthus sugar, a lot of it, sweet and cool and delicious!" The second concubine frowned and said, "I want to sleep for a while. This sound keeps calling. How annoying! Can you stop him from calling?" Zhang Xiaosan quickly called the old maid to go outside and tell him. The old maid told the messenger, the messenger told the gatekeeper, and the gatekeeper told the policeman at the door. The policeman, along with the sergeant who had come to thank him, came to the small alley and said to the sour plum drink seller, "Hey, stop shouting here. Division Commander Zhang's bedroom is right behind the wall." The sour plum drink seller, seeing the sergeant and policeman coming together, dared not say more. He picked up his load and left, muttering in his mouth, "Officials always make trouble for the common people. They don't even allow calling where he sleeps. This business is hard to do. I'm going to join the army." (The End)</p>

<p>— Ke Er</p>
<p>It was Saturday afternoon, and the dormitory was as quiet as death. Painting boxes, violins, and other things lay scattered in the corners, as if they were sleeping. In three days, this semester would be over. Friends who had homes to go to were all preparing to pack and leave, busy saying goodbye to their lovers and joining fellow villagers to spend this terrible hot summer in the warm embrace of their hometowns. Because they were about to have a small separation from Shanghai, they should at least take a stroll in the movie theater, park, or perhaps on the road, for that last moment of nostalgia. Who would stay in the dormitory and sulk?</p>
<p>The moldy rain, like an old woman's annoying nagging, like a festering sore, sowed the seeds of pain and annoyance on the earth. The noise of the neighbors penetrated the humid air. Rickshaws crushed the coal cinder of Changchun Road in the rain, making a rustling sound. Ah, depression and sorrow constantly attacked the heart of the wanderer. Perhaps he was gazing at the misty, gray sky on the terrace, or perhaps he was lying in bed thinking about something. Although he was flipping through a book at random, only line after line of printed characters floated before his eyes. Suddenly, a bright spark burst, and a fellowship invitation fell from the book.</p>
<p>"At 6:00 PM on June 20th, the Sixth Research Comrades' Fellowship will be held at the Dentholmo Hotel. You are cordially invited to attend..."</p>
<p>Wasn't it? Lao Huang told me yesterday to go earlier. It was already 5:45. Go ahead, go share a cup of happiness with some people.</p>
<p>In the tram, I thought that the joy I had hoped for for a long time would be realized immediately, and I thought of the institute and everything that had happened to the students in the past.</p>
<p>Our spirit of painting is calm and upward. Of course, it is commendable in the vertical aspect, but there is too little connection in the horizontal aspect. We are estranged and scattered, and no one understands anyone. In order to hope to dispel the barriers between classmates, so it was in the late spring that a few classmates in our charcoal drawing room initiated the Spark Society. Unexpectedly, the fact gave us a great disappointment. Although the classmates participated, they were not very enthusiastic. The biggest reason was that we could not make the classmates absolutely without doubt. Then there was Brother Tong's illness. Lao Huang and Xiao Rong were busy with their affairs. I also went to other places for some other events. The declaration stood lonely on the bulletin board and became increasingly haggard. Our organization was declared abortive. But the blame should still be borne by us initiators. Why is the will so fragile and the perseverance so lacking?</p>
<p>Artists, please poke your heads out of the ivory tower. Many attendees have gathered in Dentholmo. Misses are squeezing their bodies in narrow silk. Their lips are crimson, their hair is curled. The guys constantly pay attention to their new suits, fearing that they will accidentally be stained with dust or stepped on by others. Their polished leather shoes! Ah, beautiful lines, imaginative colors, undulating under dreamlike lights. Lao Xia and Lao Huang are busy greeting and arranging. Brother Zhong Da came despite his illness (?). We are really unspeakably happy.</p>
<p>6:40,</p>
<p>Chairman Fang Xuegu gave the opening speech,</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Qiucao reported on the establishment of the Research Institute,</p>
<p>The chairman introduced Mr. Hua Lin's speech, followed by a burst of warm applause.</p>
<p>Isn't Mr. Hua Lin a scholar who is very knowledgeable in art theory? We feel very fortunate and grateful that he took the time to come to us today. He talked about the Italian Renaissance and the artist's tireless search for comfort, giving us a fresh revelation and a correct understanding of art. His attitude is sincere and earnest, and his words are active and profound. Unfortunately, no one took shorthand. It is a great loss to ourselves and to friends who did not participate in this gathering. Mr. Hua Lin promised us that he would be very willing to talk to us when he had the opportunity in the future. We believe that Mr. Hua Lin is not just saying it.</p>
<p>Brother Tong is really a genius of humor. An ordinary sentence turns around in his brain and is broadcast from his mouth, immediately becoming funny and thought-provoking. But no matter how much others laugh, he still keeps a straight face and doesn't move a muscle. Although he came despite his illness today, his enthusiasm is still unabated. He not only teases the guys, but also refuses to let go of the misses. When Shao Guanghong's harmonica solo was over, he stood up to introduce Mr. Xi, portraying his resume vividly, and insisted that Mr. Xi sing a Hangzhou tune.</p>
<p>A burst of applause and laughter,</p>
<p>Friends, perhaps you have not admired Mr. Xi's demeanor. Hey, when he stands up to speak, covering his mouth with a handkerchief, shaking his waist, and speaking in a shrill voice, the misses can't help but smile when they see him.</p>
<p>Lao Huang's magic is not a waist-cutting beauty, but a waist-cutting thumb.</p>
<p>A Bing's magic is not water circulation, but water.</p>
<p>Oh, we forgot that Miss Pan's foreign songs are sung very well. When we run past the palace every day after class, wisps of trembling singing constantly penetrate from the window holes, circling alone on the palm trees. Ah, that tortuous note, that intoxicating melody, is really delicious.</p>
<p>Brother Tong is responsible for pulling and urging people.</p>
<p>Although after several enthusiastic applause and urging, after all, Eastern women have not yet extracted the quality of shyness. Everyone's palms are sore from clapping, and they can only get Miss Pan's few euphemistic and charming excuses.</p>
<p>There are more and more proposals. Brother Tong, the temporary chairman of the entertainment department, is too busy to eat. Finally, the mentors were also swept into the vortex. But after all, the old foxes are resourceful. When they have no way to perfunctory anymore, they reach into their arms and take out a brocade bag of wonderful plans. They clap their eyes open and the smoke fills the entire dining room. Instantaneous light photography, the last program.</p>
<p>Happiness filled every cell in our bodies, and white wings were drawn from our shoulders. Ah, flying in the starry sky.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Municipal Administration of Four Major Cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Hankou <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>By Dong Xiujia</p>
<p>European and American countries attach great importance to municipal administration. If municipal administration is not developed, it will hinder the country's resources and social order. In recent years, the National Government in my country has also paid great attention to the reform of municipal administration during the construction period, striving for the new development of each city. It has either sent special personnel to Europe and the United States for inspection or conducted detailed investigations in the country to learn from municipal administration. The four major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Hankou hold the nation's pivot, and their administrative facilities should be systematically investigated as a comparative study of domestic municipal administration. By discarding its shortcomings and taking its strengths, the development of municipal administration will not be far off. Only the governments of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou are the most important because their institutions are complex and their undertakings are numerous. The Nanjing City Government is divided into six bureaus: Public Works, Finance, Health, Social Affairs, Education, and Land, as well as the Secretariat and the Council Chamber. The Shanghai City Government is divided into bureaus of Public Works, Finance, Public Security, Health, Social Affairs, Education, Public Utilities, Port Affairs, and Land, as well as the Secretariat and the Council Chamber. The Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau and the French Concession Engineering Bureau are also divided into multiple offices. The Hangzhou City Government is divided into three bureaus: Public Security, Public Works, and Finance, as well as four sections: Land, Education, Social Affairs, and Health. However, scholars studying municipal administration must have a detailed understanding of such municipal conditions. This entire facility should be explored and compared with the methods of these three cities to serve as a reference for improving other cities. The author, in view of this and as his own responsibility, has this investigation of municipal administration, detailing the special advantages of the four major cities and attaching his own views on improving municipal administration for researchers or responsible persons to adopt. Although the points presented are generally methods that major European and American cities have implemented for a long time and have achieved effective results, they are also methods that major cities in my country urgently need to emulate. Therefore, this kind of municipal administration investigation report is of great concern to the future of municipal administration in cities throughout the country, and the value of this book can also be seen in this. As for the author being a municipal administration expert, there is no need to introduce him here.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter is general affairs. In order to make it systematic, the author will describe it using inductive methods. General affairs include municipal governments and their various bureaus, offices, and sections, and matters of a public nature, such as office procedures, file management systems, employment methods, attendance methods, statistical compilation, propaganda methods, saving supplies, joint office work, and the abolition of the first section of each bureau, centralized procurement, and other issues. The most prominent of these is the plan for the period of political tutelage, which the municipal government should also pay attention to. The author has included all those that should be considered to belong to general affairs in this general affairs chapter for discussion. Office procedures are to explain the order of handling affairs in an agency, based on the regulations or general rules of an agency, and to draw up a guide for employees to handle affairs, which is most beneficial for handling affairs and especially useful for new employees of an agency. Now, in order to avoid errors in handling affairs and reduce them, cities in various countries explain the procedures for handling affairs to new employees at any time, so there is a paper on office procedures suspended in the office of each agency. Its method is excellent. Most of the major cities in my country have adopted this method, which shows that the progress of municipal administration cannot be measured. Although this is a very common thing, scholars who truly study municipal administration need to investigate its situation in detail.</p>
<p>Secondly, methods of municipal administration propaganda are also important. The citizens not only need to understand the things that the city is doing, but also translate the precedents of things done by cities in various countries into vernacular language, print them into pamphlets, and distribute them to the citizens, so that the public knows that all countries pay great attention to municipal construction and that the municipal administration methods currently in effect in my country have all been implemented by various countries long ago. The other reliance on daily newspaper municipal administration weekly publications to promote municipal administration speeches is also important. All undertakings that want to start and seek full development must pay attention to the various working methods described above. Therefore, the practical municipal administration plan for the six-year period of political tutelage can be realized.</p>
<p>"The municipal administration plan for the period of political tutelage is to be completed in six years, and orders were issued to the provinces and cities to carry out the undertakings that should be carried out during the period of political tutelage in six years (and to carry out the undertakings that should be carried out during the period of political tutelage in a planned manner year by year, so that constitutional government can be implemented in accordance with the Prime Minister's will from the 24th year of the Republic of China. This time, I went to the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou to inspect municipal administration and saw that Hangzhou was preparing for village, neighborhood, and community autonomy. Nanjing was also studying the division of autonomous regions. Shanghai Special City also entrusted committees from various cities and townships to actively prepare for the autonomous affairs of cities and townships. Our city specially presented to the central government for approval to organize a temporary council for the cultivation of self-government. This is because we feel that the time for political tutelage is very short and we cannot but prepare in advance for the autonomous undertakings during the period of constitutional government. The method of preparing in advance is excellent. However, in addition to the training of people's self-government that has already been prepared in various cities, it seems that there is no concrete plan for the work that should be done during the period of political tutelage. ... My intention is that everything will be established in advance. Since the central government has set the period of political tutelage for six years, each bureau of our city should pre-set the work of political tutelage for six years and complete it annually. ... Therefore, since the work of each bureau of the city government has a certain standard, the citizens of the entire city can also understand the work of the city government year by year, and the constitutional government can be implemented when the constitutional government begins." We can see from the above that the municipal administration plan for the period of political tutelage is extremely important. If it is carried out step by step and improved year by year, then the day when my country's municipal administration wants to keep pace with Europe and the United States is not far off.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Public Works. This includes many issues, including the issue of surveying the entire city, the issue of main roads throughout the city, the issue of roadbeds, the issue of selecting road materials, the issue of the city's administrative district plan, the issue of land acquisition prices and road construction fees, the design committee, and the issue of planning the entire city of Hankou. The author discusses these in detail in separate sections.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Public Administration. This chapter covers a very large scope, but during this investigation of the administration of the three cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, the author paid special attention to the following five issues in public administration: the establishment of electrical testing laboratories, the reorganization of street lights, advertising issues, the installation of traffic lights, and the issues of trams and buses. These are described in detail in this chapter.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Social Administration. This includes three categories: agriculture, industry, commerce, and labor-management issues, charitable undertakings. Its scope is very large and its responsibilities are very heavy. Even if it is handled properly, its achievements are not seen, which is completely different from public works administration or public administration. This kind of administration is a term recently created in my country's law, which combines the agriculture, industry, commerce bureau and the public welfare bureau administration stipulated in the previous law into one. The intention of this kind of combined administration method is to reduce administrative expenses and transfer them to business expenses, which is very good. However, because the scope of administration is too large, it is not easy to handle. This time, the author went to the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou to investigate municipal administration. He paid special attention to social administration and was greatly concerned about the reorganization and promotion of agriculture, industry, commerce, labor-management disputes, unemployment relief, civic housing, charitable undertakings, and other issues in each city. The development of urban construction undertakings is closely related to agriculture, industry, and commerce. If agriculture, industry, and commerce cannot develop, the city government's income will not improve, and the urban construction undertakings will not be revitalized. Secondly, labor-management disputes have become the most troublesome issue in modern cities. All cities should pay special attention to them. For example, imperialists are destroying my country's laborers, causing various storms that have a great impact on local security. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau must conduct in-depth research on the issue of labor-management disputes, while still following the Prime Minister's will of labor-management harmony, striving to promote labor-management cooperation so that laborers will not be misled by malignant forces, and capital can improve the treatment of workers within the scope of their abilities. The next issue is the issue of unemployment, which is also the most important issue in cities around the world. In the cities of various countries, there is still no considerable solution. It is especially important in my country to try to provide relief. The other items have been stated separately by the author and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>There are also educational administration, health administration, public security administration, port administration, financial administration, and land administration. The author has described what he has learned in detail. During the period of political tutelage and construction, such a special book comparing the municipal administration of major cities is rare. Since the publication of this book, it will have a great impact on the progress of various municipal administrations in my country, and the points discussed in this book have been adopted and implemented in the city of Hankou, which has discovered unique effects. The value of this book can be seen from this.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Children's Club <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>Inaugural Issue Published by Joint Bookstore</p>
<p>Recently, a good phenomenon has been emerging in the Chinese publishing world, which is paying attention to the publication of children's books, increasing elementary school students' interest in reading, and guiding them to proper entertainment, preventing them from reading all kinds of useless and bad books. Moreover, these books should not be aimed at profit in bookstores, but should strive for low prices to reduce the burden on children, and should not exploit children as much as books for college or middle school students. Otherwise, it would hinder the future of children's education. Now I want to recommend to readers this "Children's Club", seeing that its publishing purpose is to cope with this environment and produce a publication. Its content is suitable for elementary school students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. There is no need to worry about being too profound or too superficial, and it adopts the strengths of various publications to innovate, striving for new and correct ideas in writing, and guiding children to a bright path as a vital force in the reform of children's education.</p>
<p>At the same time, elementary school students' thoughts are very simple. If they are properly trained and cultivated, they can easily embark on a meaningful life path. However, cultivating their ability to read and appreciate is also extremely important. What do they really do every day? They go to school to listen to teachers and play with friends, and return home to help their families with small tasks. These things are too annoying. If they are called to entertainment venues, it is of course most appropriate to allow them to read this "Children's Club", as the editor said in the "Meeting" section of this publication:</p>
<p>"In this small entertainment venue, someone tells you stories, someone tells you jokes, someone teaches you new ways to play, there are truths you can't hear in the classroom, and there are funs you can't get at home. There are also beautiful pictures that surpass natural scenery, and clear and wonderful music and elegant singing that are no less than the performances and singing in dance halls, and there are endless and inexhaustible varieties of juggling and amusement, making you want to listen and watch and play until you dream of your mother's side. What a fun entertainment venue this is! Children, please come, please come quickly to this wonderful entertainment venue!"</p>
<p>"Children, as you play in this entertainment venue every day, your wisdom can increase day by day, your body can become stronger day by day, and your character can become more noble day by day. You will find it more interesting to listen to lectures in the classroom, and you will have more fun playing with friends. When you return home and talk to your older and younger brothers, older and younger sisters, they will admire and respect you all the more. See how beneficial this entertainment venue is to you!"</p>
<p>These words have considerable significance. If children's literature is founded in accordance with such pure principles, of course, it will not</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>make any mistakes. Cultivating children's reading habits is ten thousand times more noble than fathers and elder brothers taking them into improper entertainment venues. The stories, fairy tales, etc. collected here pay attention to both fun and thought, and instill in them a lot of world literature and music knowledge. For example, Hu Zhaoshu's "Why Should We Learn Music?" is a clear exposition. At the beginning, the author explains the five reasons why we should learn music: (1) Music can make our bodies healthy; (2) Music can make our minds happy; (3) Music is a good social skill; (4) Music is the best kind of education; (5) Music is a tool that makes us move forward. This saying is of course very appropriate. Music can make individuals move forward, and considering the entire society, it can also make the entire society move forward. Because of this, children have a reason to learn music. Secondly, there is the same author's biography of the world musician Ludwig Van Beethoven, which describes his life and musical talent in extremely simple language. Children can certainly benefit a lot from reading such a biography. At least in terms of general knowledge, it can be enriched. Even we adults can benefit from reading it. Moreover, if the biography of a celebrity is recorded in history, then we cannot get a deep memory from reading it. This is a reading experience. Reading a biography here, in addition to arousing infinite interest, can also gain some musical knowledge, which is really valuable.</p>
<p>The "Science World" column is also very valuable. For example, Fu Zhenshi's telephone, the wireless telephone that others cannot hear, robots driving airplanes, electric typewriters, fish also drowning, and airplanes protecting fruit trees are all works that stimulate children's intelligence and increase their inspiration for invention. The author's writing is mainly based on fun, so we don't feel the dryness and boredom of reading other science books when we read some of them. Moreover, the narrative strives to be concise and does not contain any empty words, but in this extremely short description, children can get a lot of so-called scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>"Peach Blossom's Song" is full of infinite poetic flavor. The author strives to refine the rhymes so that readers can sing easily, but there is no affectation or reduction of the clear and simple poetic essence. Poetry originally contains mystery, which of course cannot be the case here. It must be mainly for children to understand, so this type of poetry looks clear and simple on the surface, as if it was written by people who do not have sufficient literary cultivation. In fact, it is necessary to consider various difficult problems, such as being easy to sing and easy to understand, which is really not easy to express so precisely. This "Peach Blossom's Song" can be said to be a model of children's poetry.</p>
<p>Others such as Xie Liuyi's "Hen and Chicks," Ying'er and Jiang Heng's "Rabbit's Cotton Tail and Big Turtle" are all extremely valuable masterpieces. When we read them, we can understand that they are written by people who have full literary cultivation, not as beautifully as ordinary people who create children's literature can write. Therefore, children's literature is not an easy work to create. At the same time, in today's era when young people's thoughts are unusually divergent, children's literature cannot be ignored.</p>
