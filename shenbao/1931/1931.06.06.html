<p>前所視爲世界和平之危機者一爲蘇俄一爲德國各國初震於蘇俄濟經計劃之遠大傾銷貨物之足以影響於世界之商業一時談虎色變或主抵制或主報復凡與蘇俄商業上關係密切者莫不有敵視之意而今則又與俄進行親善矣如昨日意外相所言希望鞏固意俄經濟恊定俄電所傅法俄進行通商談判皆足爲與蘇俄活動交易之證是可知各國之對俄已不取深閉固拒之策而轉以流通爲抵制親善爲竸爭矣果以親善爲竸爭而不用其他手段亦保障和平之一道也各國又驚疑於德奥之稅約以爲稅約足以擾亂歐洲之經濟而德國復以戰後所負担之賠欵足以妨碍其生存於是德與各國之意見常若不能相容今觀意外相演說謂已了解德國在經濟上所受壓迫應共謀補救方法我人確信德國能恢復經濟不僅有益於歐洲和平且爲和平不可少之要素其言甚誠懇而切要現稅約問題已由國際法庭審查而賠欵之事德英要人將有一度非正式會議使果能順利進行者則此會議實爲解决賠欵問題之先聲是又保障和平之一道也故以今日形勢言世界和平又不似前日之悲觀矣</p>

<p>— 吳疴塵</p>
<p>骨牌爲昔日之高尚戲具現代之用以博勝負者實越創始時之本意骨牌之創相傅爲宋徽宗之宣和二年至高宗之紹興元年曾以使用之高尚詔頒行天下於是當時之文人墨客於詩酒之餘輒以研究其種種使用爲消遣惟皆獨自玩之於明窗几淨之間不若現代之呼盧喝雉者也蓋其組織雖由於二十一點之配搭而成三十二張然其千變萬化之莫測則覺有無窮盡之興趣行之者雖以閉門造車擬之然其所得之精神愉快有逾乎入五都之巿茲將所知者略述於後</p>
<p>屬於文學者有牌詞牌詩牌歌牌曲牌柬牌箋牌信牌經等苟或一張不誤可得純粹之聯環不同與五子合巧等</p>
<p>屬於迷信者有牌卜牌課牌籌牌籤牌風水牌算命牌掘藏牌金庫牌判斷牌斷龍以及專叩酒色財氣四種之前後左右之聯環推算法又有所謂拆烏龜打天九等則行之最易而又盡人所能聞謂筮卜之最感靈騐者前有諸葛亮之牙牌神數後有劉伯温之牙牌八卦設以牙牌神數論則漢時早已有此骨牌不必有待乎宋高宗之詔示天下矣所聞如是牙牌神數之是否武侯所創則有待證之必要也</p>
<p>屬於滑稽者有牌訴寃之呈文牌衙門之批示牌訊問之口供紅娘之寄柬露情刁劉氏之四門唱歌等等最近風行之牌登榜一文聞爲袁隨園所創上述各文均以點之式樣多少與乎色之配合而詠以潇灑不凡之四六句全篇结構一以能成聯環式之不同五子合巧爲歸束</p>
<p>屬於情感者有孟姜女萬里尋夫孫夫人默想荆州思夫雙垂涙（俗說想十副）娥小姐私奔俏紅娘偷情晴雯補百衲等惟是项配合爲單獨之不同五子合巧或但求成對但仍須三十二張貫通所不同者。無聯環之巧耳。</p>
<p>屬於尚武者。有打五關。關公五關斬六將。以及忠臣討賊。攻打天門陣等等。現在之婦稚皆知者。祇有打五關與五關斬將等兩種。</p>
<p>屬於藝術者。有穿八吉排卍字。堆花籃採雙桃搭天字路路通。以及滄海尋粟。釜底抽薪。又有所謂二六頭三六尾者。則至今未有能貫通者。法之簡易。無異接龍。惟須以二六爲頭。三六爲尾。予窮數月之配搭。仍然多一張三五或二五也。</p>
<p>上述各種使用之玩意。予於十餘年間。或得諸先慈之口述。或得諸友朋之筆錄。或得諸昔賢之抄本而存置之。民四之秋。予在北平舊書肆。曾以銀元數枚。購得骨牌百法之抄本五卷。據識者云。紙爲明製想係明代所遺。予視如拱璧。惜於越年春。遺失於口外途次。至今惜之。</p>

<p>— 吉自汕寄</p>
<p>愚由厦門來汕。迄今旬餘矣。汕市較廣於厦市倍餘。而富庶或不如之。其</p>
<p>道途建築　尚稱平坦。崗警隨時可見。惟詢以路徑者。輒摇首瞠目。不知所對。使初到汕市者。大感困難。願當局者之加以訓練也。</p>
<p>報章之多　亦倍於厦。大報有汕報嶺東民國日報。新嶺東報。潮梅新報。民聲日報。天聲日報。眞言日報等多種。編製排列。仿照香港報紙。其中銷路最廣者爲「汕報」。「天聲」「眞言」以出版時間未久。閲者殊寥寥。惟天聲編製尚佳。努力前進。不乏新機。眞言編印俱劣。恐難自振矣。小報有「雙日」「風」「韓江」三種。前者兩日一出。後二者三日一現。編製如海上小報。競爭殊烈。故雙日并風排印俱佳。惜山市小於滬江不知幾許。採取資料。大非易易耳。星期各報俱停刊。星期一。各出四開小報式之增刊一紙。不談政治社會。祇談風花雪月。亦生面之别開者也。</p>
<p>汕市人民　似頗嗜賭。否則寶檯何以多至每路必有。門榜咸書「銀牌」。入門則俱番灘。而</p>
<p>花事　則分「南詞」蘇帮「省妓」本地「潮妓」「潮州」三種。更分特上中三下五等。視其納捐之多寡而定。蓋汕頭之捐幾多至無物不捐也。至於</p>
<p>游藝　則不如厦門遠甚。戲院祇「眞光」「光天」「新舞台」三處。東有「因時」游藝場。則祇供下級社會之休憇。游藝種類。亦殊寥寥。滬上梅花歌舞團。曾來此表演十數天。新舞台前車水馬龍。頗極一時之盛。（聞該團於十七日起程赴廣州。出演於省敎育會）良以汕巿人民每聞有新奇歌舞輒爭先參觀也</p>

<p>— 霖</p>
<p>自然界的異蹟</p>
<p>現在大家想像罷在一個印度洋裏的遙遠小島上叢林中間白沙灘上有一隻雪白的海鳥伸了翅膀從烈日下保護伊的小鳥好的對待者是一個所謂白人跑在她面前週身鱗傷被彈藥染成黃色他爲了口渴已經半狂了這個袛須一舉手間便可得到四十磅的鮮肉但是我不能這樣做因爲她的眼睛注視着我露出很堅决的樣子我將四週的環境都忘掉了祗覺得生命的奇異</p>
<p>後來我又在樹林裏搜尋遇到一羣已經長成而尚未生羽的海鷗他們在一條支流的旁邊當我走經他們之前他們向我呌着要東西吃這眞使我呆住了我揀了一隻最大的想把他的頭撕掉可是辦不到他頭頸像橡皮帶一樣扭了過去重復彈回來後來我把他的頭咬去吮他的血滋味的惡劣眞是可怕</p>
<p>我小時候崇拜魯濱生克羅沙可是現在的環境都出乎我意料之外　如我在書本上從來没有讀着說是白沙灘上有整千的小虫預備吸人膏血到了夜裏我们的精力恢復了大家就上雪尼軍艦去否則便要做小虫或吃人鳥的犧牲品至於能否上邀仁慈尚不可知哩因之我們中間十二個人走上一隻陳舊不堪而不適於航海的救生船向澎湃的浪海中駛去可是吾們竭力要船走向前去都被大浪打了回來笨重的船進行非常困難</p>
<p>兩小時之後大家精疲力竭全船十二人現在祗存了三個人其餘九個人都被巨浪打到船底裏去了餘着的人努力向前將船划向海灣那里浪高如山都打在我們的頸項裏我們除了最後用力之外向天禱告出發的時候船上共有八個漿到了現在除了僅僅一個之外都被冲入海裏了我們只得靠了這一條漿慢慢的很不穏的拚命划向前去我除了將陸地推向後去之外没有再比這個喜悅的了</p>
<p>逃出死關</p>
<p>這救生船忽然　漏立刻進水在船還没有打成碎片之前我們竭力划向遠處的雪尼號云兩個人將船中的水汲去第三個人拚命划船以便走近大船在初雪尼號的梯路雖然燃着燈我们却一些也看不見在月光之下我們常見成羣的鮫繞着我們小船船上常常發出軋軋的聲音发明告訴我們不以再經巨浪的打擊了</p>
<p>最後我們的小船靠近雪尼軍艦的梯路因爲這時候輪到我划船所以我是最後一個人踏上结實的梯路當我一隻脚踏着梯子的時候只覺得小船朝下一沉等到另一隻脚舉起來水面上袛存着幾塊碎木板飄浮着還有許多失望的鮫也驚在水上</p>
<p>雪尼號軍艦上的官長將燈光照着我們並且立即施以搜查這實然是件容易的事因爲我們的衣服早已不在身上了我所最不能忘懐的就是他们所賜的一杯茶滋味之佳不可名狀</p>
<p>後來我們轉至法國的巡洋艦上運到可侖坡我們擠在梯子下面的一個小甬道中旣没有衣服也没有毛毯受盡俘虜的痛苦船上的幾個英國兵送食物與毛毯給我們可是站在梯子上面的法國兵極力拒絶曾經有三次我們的朋友將法國兵推倒於梯下然後將毯子食物送給我們可是這樣一來他們便不准上梯子看我們了</p>
<p>在我看來這樣的對待俘虜實在太不公平了如果俘虜碰在我們手裏情形就很不同在檳榔嶼的地方愛姆登艦曾經擊沉一隻法國滅魚雷艦我們的艦長茂婁在敵方砲火未完之前放下船去救起三十六個法國兵雖然船上所有的食料及香烟等很少我們還分給他們同亨當我們將他們運上别的船上去時他們都高呼道謝他們又說曾聽見人家道德國人對待俘虜非常凶殘</p>
<p>我們又轉到海姆司却亞船上送往馬爾太去我願意說我所經歷的與愛姆登艦上所留存未死的爲數甚少大約袛有五十個人大戰之後我曾經遇見過其中幾個人可是大家的形狀與前各不相同科科司島一役實在是致人命傷的</p>
<p>消遙旅程</p>
<p>這是一件歷史上的事那遺存在島上的四十九個人駕了一隻舊的亞亦俠帆船和一點食料清水駛向阿拉伯海岸而去到了那里大家便上岸趁車經由漠地到大麥司克司地方可是身上衣服襤褸樓惟悴不堪幾乎不能土道而那里的士人又如何能相信這椿故事呢他們的這一件功蹟實在是不可能的</p>
<p>有兩件事在我頭腦中歷憶不忘就是愛姆登船上的兵臨終時倚了槍向艦長口呼爲艦長歡呼三聲及法國滅魚雷艦在檳榔嶼被擊沉的光景</p>
<p>講到第二件事那時候我正在軍火起運室中地位非常之狹小衹有四尺見方室中兩部起重機早已被砲火炸裂橡皮燃燒的氣味使我室息欲死室中光亮原祇臘燭一根自從養氣斷絶以後没有數分鐘也就熄滅了在開戰的時候開啓鐵甲門是有違軍令的所以我靜伏在室中奄奄一息後來我從傅語管中聽見暫時停戰的聲音我用盡我所有的力量扳開鐵門走上甲板呼吸救命的空氣</p>
<p>我以死而復蘇忘記一切旭日從海中上升黑暗中間現着金光燦爛的半個太陽望過去却有敵船的半個船尾翹在水面上輪機鼓動的聲音我們也都聴得到四秒鐘之後那船動搖轉側一瞬間便沉至水下去了在這時候我不禁勾起哲思默注着上帝所造的旭日目送那人造的船隻下沉這件事比了在馬特拉司油櫃炸裂火光燭天的光景還要令人震顫哩（完）</p>

<h3 id="e24">Important Issues Regarding the European Situation <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Previously, the crises viewed as threats to world peace were the Soviet Union and Germany. Initially, various countries were shocked by the Soviet Union's ambitious economic plan and the dumping of goods, which had the potential to impact world commerce. For a time, they spoke of the Soviet Union with alarm, advocating either containment or retaliation. All those with close commercial ties to the Soviet Union were viewed with hostility. But now, they are engaging in friendly relations with Russia. As the Italian Foreign Minister unexpectedly stated yesterday, he hopes to consolidate the Italo-Russian economic agreement. Reports from Russia indicate that France and Russia are conducting trade negotiations. All this is sufficient evidence of engaging in activities and trade with the Soviet Union. It is clear that various countries no longer adopt a policy of strict refusal towards Russia, but rather turn to circulation for containment and friendly relations for competition. If competition is pursued through friendly relations and no other means are used, it is also a way to ensure peace. Various countries are also alarmed and suspicious of the German-Austrian customs union, believing that the union would disrupt the European economy. Germany, in turn, argues that the war reparations it bears hinder its survival. Thus, the opinions of Germany and other countries often seem incompatible. Now, observing the Italian Foreign Minister's speech, he stated that he understands the economic oppression that Germany has suffered and should jointly seek remedies. We firmly believe that Germany's ability to restore its economy is not only beneficial to European peace but also an indispensable element for peace. His words are very sincere and essential. Currently, the customs union issue is being examined by the International Court of Justice, and key German and British figures will hold an informal meeting. If this can proceed smoothly, then this meeting will be a prelude to resolving the reparations issue. This is also a way to ensure peace. Therefore, in today's situation, world peace does not seem as pessimistic as it was before.</p>

<p>Maintain Constant Friendship With Austria and Germany</p>
<p>But One's Own Interests Must Be Protected</p>
<p>Rome, 4th (Reuters) -- Italian Foreign Minister Grandi spoke in the Senate yesterday about the German-Austrian Customs Union, saying that on March 21st, the German and Austrian ambassadors informed the Italian government of the draft agreement establishing the customs union between the two countries. On the 2nd, the original text of the draft agreement was shown, stating that the alliance took the form of a purely economic plan. The main aim, they said, was to alleviate the economic tensions currently experienced by Germany and Austria. The world was astonished to hear this, as it was thought that such difficulties did not exist for Austria. Several countries were particularly alarmed, but Italy remained calm throughout. However, the important relationship of this agreement to Italy's interests could not escape Italy's attention. He then informed Germany that the Italian government had an unfavorable impression of this and would make a final judgment after a detailed study of the issue. The matter was handed over to a special committee for review, with the participation of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and others. Soon after, the British government proposed submitting the issue to the Council of the League of Nations, which Italy immediately supported. As for the financial aspect of the issue, the Italian government, after consulting with the British and French governments, proposed submitting the matter to the Governing Committee established in 1922, and the German government also requested that the Austrian-German draft agreement be included in the agenda of the committee as a remedy for the European economic panic. Germany believes that the customs union can improve the overall European situation, not just Germany and Austria. The Italian delegation to Geneva had the procedure carefully planned by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and all those present at the meeting agreed to it. It is generally acknowledged that several countries in Central and Eastern Europe have long been part of an economic group, and their agricultural and industrial products are mutually complementary for economic, geographical, or historical reasons. This adjustment can be made easier if carried out using purely economic methods with no political implications. Two countries that can each benefit from mutual trade may negotiate a direct agreement. Italy has already done so, as evidenced by the recent Italian-Austrian agreement. The result of the European Committee was the establishment of the Geneva International Agricultural Lending Institution, which is clearly beneficial, but its function should not be overestimated, as the state of the agricultural economy throughout Europe is very serious. The Austrian representative has agreed not to proceed with the customs union until the Council of the League of Nations has made a decision. The participants then adopted the British proposal and decided to submit the issue to the Permanent Court of Justice. All countries participating in the League of Nations have now expressed their views on this issue. Italy is only considering protecting its interests from the impact of the Austrian-German agreement. Italy's attitude towards Austria and Germany has always been friendly. Austria is bound by treaties and united by common interests. Austria is well aware of Italy's feelings, as Italy has done for Austria in the past twelve years what no other European country has done. We are not indifferent to Austria's difficulties and the Mussolini government has been closely monitoring the situation in Austria, ready to provide assistance at any time. However, we treat them with sincere friendship, and they should reciprocate with the same sincerity. As for Germany, Italy sympathizes greatly with Germany's efforts to restore its rightful place in the world. We firmly believe that a politically stable and economically recovered Germany is not only beneficial to European peace but also essential for European peace. We understand the pressure of international obligations on Germany's economy and the need to seek remedies. Germany's financial burden is one of the biggest causes of economic and political unrest in Europe. We have held this view for a long time. On March 14th, I stated in Parliament that Mussolini's proposal in London in 1922 to solve the reparations issue equally is still the basis of the Italian government's policy on this matter. It is hoped that a satisfactory solution can be found when the League of Nations reconvenes to study the Austrian-German agreement, taking into account general political relations and solving the economic problems faced by Germany and several countries in Central and Eastern Europe. As for the attitude that Italy will adopt in the next session of the Council of the League of Nations, it will depend on the new circumstances that may arise. At this time, I dare to inform the Senate that the Mussolini government will appropriately protect the important interests of the country.</p>

<p>Moscow, 4th (National News Agency) -- According to news from Tashkent, the area for cotton planting in Soviet Central Asia this year will be 1,722,200 Russian acres, an increase of 830,000 acres over last year. The total cotton field in Russia now has 2,500,000 Russian acres. Half of this year's increase is due to less planting of grains and half is due to water conservancy and the use of machine planting methods.</p>

<p>Washington, 4th (National News Agency) -- American aviation leader Colonel Lindbergh announced today that he is preparing to depart with his wife within a month to fly across the Pacific Ocean for a tour of Japan and China. The planned route is via Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, and the Kuril Islands to Japan and China. In Japan, they plan to visit Tokyo and Osaka.

<p>London, 4th (Reuters) -- The German Zeppelin DO-X flew from Cape Verde Island in Portuguese West Africa this morning to South America. Shortly after takeoff, the captain of a certain cargo ship sent a wireless telegram stating that he had witnessed the Zeppelin crashing into the sea. This alarming news spread around the world and caused panic among those who heard it. However, before long, a telegram arrived stating that the Zeppelin was still flying safely in the sky, and it was then learned that the previous telegram was a mistake. It is likely that the Zeppelin was repairing its machinery and therefore descending rapidly. The captain of the ship mistakenly thought it had crashed and sent the telegram without proper investigation.</p>

<p>Changsha Aviation News -- A telegram from Xinnning reports that Commander Wang of the 6th Brigade of the 2nd Division of the New Eighth Army, Wang Sanjin's troops, arrived in this area (Xinnning Yaoshang) from Baoqing. Upon hearing the news, the Guangxi troops immediately dispatched Chen Zihui, the commander of the Quanzhou Garrison, and Qin's troops (more than three regiments in strength) to the Meixikou, Bashishan, Houjiazai, and Suitan Huangshagang areas in Quanzhou to resist towards Yaoshang. Because Commander Wang had not received clear orders from his superiors, he did not dare to advance deeply, but kept a close watch on the Guangxi troops. Suddenly, at noon, the vanguard of the Guangxi troops (about one battalion) was discovered on the Houjiazai side of Yaoshang's left wing, crossing the border and charging directly at Commander Wang's sentry line. They were met with a heavy blow by the 17th and 18th Regiments of Commander Wang's troops. After two hours of fierce fighting, more than ten Guangxi soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded. More than thirty rifles were seized. The enemy's momentum was unsustainable and they fled back into Guangxi. The officers and soldiers of Commander Wang's troops suffered no losses (June 1st).</p>

<p>Changshan, a Mountain Six or Seven Hundred Zhang High, Completely Collapses</p>
<p>Jiaoshui Rushes Violently to Fifty or Sixty Li Away</p>
<p>Floating Corpses, Total Losses Cannot Be Counted</p>
<p>Changsha Communication - In Yutang, Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, last month on the 29th, because dragons emerged from the mountains, the water was four or five zhang deep, drowning hundreds of people and destroying more than twenty li of the Tanbao highway. Traffic has not yet been restored, and land cracks and field collapses cannot be dealt with for the time being. Unexpectedly, in Duchang Town, Xiangtan County, on the evening of the 1st of this month, there was an unprecedented Jiaox incident. The town is bounded by Xiangxiang and Hengshan counties, surrounded by high mountains, spanning fifty or sixty li, with a population of sixty or seventy thousand and about seventy thousand mu of paddy fields. The people are completely engaged in agriculture, and the main output is grain. The surrounding famous mountains are Changshan, Tongliangshan, Yunxia Ridge, Qingcui Peak, and Fanduo Ridge. Although the Red Bandits have been rampant in recent years, the people in the town are honest and simple, and each lives in peace. Bad elements cannot hide among them, so they have never suffered from bandits, and they are like a small paradise. However, one night in the middle of the night, Changshan spawned dragons. The jiao water gushed out of the mountains, and at the same time, a strong wind and torrential rain swept over the mountains and the sea, shaking the clouds and moving the mountains. In an instant, the water was several zhang high. The people were frightened and had nowhere to escape because the incident occurred in the middle of the night. Thousands of men and women were drowned, and countless fields, houses, livestock, grains, and rice were washed away. It was not until four hours later that the rain stopped and the wind subsided, but the water did not recede. Corpses floated and no one collected them. It was not until the next day that the water receded. After investigation, Changshan, which was six or seven hundred zhang high, had collapsed. More than ten thousand qing of fields at the foot of the mountain were submerged by mountain rocks and could not be cultivated again. Moreover, the water was violent, scouring fifty or sixty li away, turning it into a small river leading directly to the Xiang River. The boulders falling from the mountains were everywhere, and the ground was cracked in many places. The losses are truly uncountable. At the same time, mountain floods also occurred in Tongliangshan and Xieling, and the situation was the same as in Changshan. The disaster was unprecedented. In addition, there is a Wu Zhao clan school in the town, with more than 80 elementary school students. When the water suddenly rose, they went upstairs to avoid it. Later, the school building was washed away, and only four of the ninety teachers and students were rescued twenty li away, and the rest were buried in the mud and rocks. It is also said to be a tragedy. People from the town who are in the provincial capital were shocked to hear of the sudden changes in the landscape and are extremely sad. They are presenting a request to the provincial government to send personnel to investigate the disaster and issue emergency relief to save the survivors. (June 3rd)</p>

<p>Red Bandits Flee from Ji'an to Guangchang Again</p>
<p>Director He Says Red Bandits Will Be Eliminated</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication - The two forces of the Jiangxi Red Bandits, Zhu and Mao, entered Jiangxi from Hunan last year and captured more than 20 counties including Ji'an. It was not until Sun Lianzhong and Wang Jinyu's troops came to Jiangxi that Yongfeng, Le'an, Nanfeng, Guangchang, Xingguo, and Yudu were recovered. Recently, Zhu and Mao attempted Ji'an but failed. So they turned east and attacked Guangchang at the end of last month. Fortunately, General Commander Zhu responded calmly and killed thousands of bandits. Because of this, the bandits split into two routes from Guangchang and Le'an and attacked Nanfeng secretly through side roads. At that time, the troops of the Road Commander Lu Xiaozhen had built fortifications along the city. On the 28th and 29th of last month, they fought fiercely with the Red Bandits for more than 20 hours. The Red Bandits' repeated attacks were repelled by the Road Commander's troops. On the 30th, Zhu Shaoliang led a large army from Guangchang to provide support. The inside and outside forces attacked together and killed more than a thousand bandits, including one bandit regiment commander. The bandits then retreated to the Ganzhu and Kuzhu areas of Guangchang. As for the bandits west of the Gan River, there were originally two forces, Kong Hechong and Li Shixing. These bandits advanced on Yuanzhou and Wanzai in three routes and were also defeated by Commander Tan and Brigade Commander Zhu, who captured more than 400 rifles and killed five or six hundred bandits. The remaining bandits fled in all directions. As for the Fang and Shao bandits in eastern Jiangxi, they are still harassing the Yiyang and Hengfeng areas. On the 21st of last month, Ruan's troops, Zhang's brigade, Wang's regiment, and Mu's battalion encountered the main force of Fang and Shao at Lengshuiwu and fought fiercely for half a day, killing many bandits. At the same time, Zhang's regiment and He's battalion encountered two thousand bandits at Yuanjiating and fought fiercely. Later, Wang's regiment arrived to provide support, and the bandits began to collapse eastward. Yesterday, Director He reported at the Memorial Week at the headquarters that, since the past ten days, the Red Bandits have fought fiercely with our army many times, and the casualties have been more than 30,000. Although our army has also suffered casualties, replenishment is very easy. After several more bloody battles, we will be able to eliminate the evil Red Bandits.</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, Chairman of Shandong Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, began yesterday (the 2nd) to inspect the troops stationed in Jinan. The inspection items were divided into personnel and horses, registers, internal affairs, firearms, and clothing.

After the inspection, he immediately gathered the officers and soldiers for a speech, roughly saying that it is the duty of soldiers to be loyal to the Party and the country, to defend against insults and protect the people, but they must pay attention to academic subjects and cultivate their spirit. After the speech, he returned to the Provincial Government and scheduled to go to Zhangzhuang on the 3rd to inspect the 86th Brigade of the 29th Division, Li Yizhi's unit, on the 4th to Xin Zhuang to inspect the 20th Division, Sun Tongxuan's unit, and the heavy mortar regiment, on the 5th to inspect the personnel of the 74th Division, Qiao Lizhi's division headquarters, and the Ma Guan First Regiment of the 220th Brigade, Yun Qichang, on the 6th to inspect the Chen Dexin's First and Second Regiments of the 220th Brigade in Xinzhuang, on the 7th to inspect the directly subordinate troops, independent regiments, battalions, and companies of the 20th Division headquarters, on the 8th to inspect the First Regiment of the 164th Brigade, Ning Chunxiao's unit, and on the 9th to inspect the Second Regiment of Ning Chunxiao's unit. As for the troops stationed outside the province, personnel will also be dispatched separately for inspection. Xu Wenyao, Deputy Division Commander of the 29th Division, went to Dezhou on the evening of the 1st to inspect the 59th Brigade, Zhao Xinde's unit.</p>
<p>When the 26th Route Army, Sun Lianzhong's unit, was stationed in Shandong Province, its subordinate cavalry division, Zhang Huatang's unit, had very sufficient personnel, horses, and firearms. It was ordered to be transferred to Huai'an to be under the command of the Pacification Supervisor Zhang Zhijiang. Later, when Sun's unit was transferred to Jiangxi to suppress bandits, the division did not follow. Recently, a part of the unit suddenly returned to Shandong Province, to Shanxian County, led by regiment commanders Yin Mingxin and Wang Qingyong, with about 2,000 men in six companies. Upon request, Han Fuqu, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, agreed to take them in. Han then appointed Li Xuande, artillery regiment commander of the 20th Division, as the brigade commander of the Provisional Cavalry First Brigade and went to reorganize the unit. Li Xuande left Jinan today (the 3rd) for Shanxian County. After the reorganization, according to Sun Lianzhong's intention, it was agreed to be temporarily under the command of Han Fuqu. Sun also sent Guan Shuren, the commander of the 4th Cavalry Division, to Jinan to handle everything. Furthermore, Han Fuqu, considering that his cavalry was still very lacking, intends to expand the cavalry to protect the area. He previously sent Xie Shuxian, the former commander of the First Regiment of the Handgun Brigade, to Koubei to select and purchase good horses for application. It is now reported that the purchase has been completed and will be shipped to Jinan soon (3rd).</p>
<h3 id="e89">Kuang Bandit Attempts to Attack Huang'an and Suffers Heavy Losses <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Division Telegraphs Victory</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the bandits on the borders of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui were severely suppressed by Li Mingzhong's leadership of Ji Hongchang, Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, and other units, most of them have fled to Jinjiazhai on the border of Anhui. Those in Hubei Province are only scattered small groups, which are responsible for the suppression by Xiao Zhichu's unit of the 44th Division. Unexpectedly, on May 28, the Kuang bandit, Ji Xun, led his troops to attack Huang'an, besieging the county and Taohuabu, which belongs to the county. After the division's fierce blocking and bloody battle for four days and nights, the bandits attacking Taohuabu were defeated. They are now fighting hand-to-hand with the bandits attempting to attack Huang'an. In this battle, the bandits suffered more than a dozen casualties of puppet regiment and battalion commanders. The division also suffered casualties. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. The telegram from the staff office of the division reporting the victory is recorded below: (1) The Kuang bandit Ji Xun attacked Taohua on the morning of May 28. Xu, the battalion commander of our 263rd regiment, used a battalion of troops to defend in many ways and fought fiercely with the bandits for four days and nights. The bandits attacked our Xu battalion officers and soldiers with all their strength, and they responded calmly, preferring to die rather than retreat. (2) Seeing that our officers and soldiers were brave and could not be captured by force, the bandits changed their plan, besieging Taohua with a division, deploying a part of them in the mountain passes on all sides to block our reinforcements, cutting off our traffic between Huang'an and using the main force to attack Huang'an, digging trenches and building fortresses, which was extremely cunning. Wang, the brigade commander stationed in Huang'an, transferred the two battalions stationed in Feng Xiuhua and Yang's regiment to Huang'an City, Nangugujian to defend, determined to fight the bandits to the death. (3) Our division sent a regiment each from Chen and Xin brigades and the Second Replenishment Regiment, led by Deputy Division Commander Hua Wenxuan, to support the station in Baliwan on the evening of the 30th. On the morning of the 31st, they advanced north along the Zhonghesi-Xiangsi line. At the same time, the First Replenishment Regiment advanced north along the Yinhe River from Songbu. At noon, they drove away the Red Guards in the area of Hengdian, Xiaofengshan and Xuchangzhai, and then encountered the main force of the Kuang bandits besieging Taohua and launched a fierce attack on them. The bandits were initially extremely stubborn, fought fiercely for several hours, but eventually collapsed to the northeast and west mountains due to excessive casualties. By 5:00 p.m., the siege of Taohua was lifted. Although our Xu battalion officers and soldiers were besieged for four days and nights, their fighting spirit was still not slackened. (4) In this battle, more than a dozen enemy puppet regimental, battalion, and company commanders and more than a thousand bandits were killed, and dozens of guns were seized. This was a heavy blow rarely seen by the bandits. Our Xu battalion suffered more than two company commanders and thirty soldiers killed in action. (5) It is planned to move eastward and attack the bandits who are trying to attack Huang'an within the shortest possible time. Special news from the staff office of the 44th Division Dongyin (June 2).</p>
<h3 id="e90">Committee Members of Hubei Provincial Government Take Office <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>First Discussion Meeting Resolves More Than Ten Important Cases</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the committee members of the Hubei Provincial Government were appointed by the Central Government, they have come to Hubei one after another and plan to take the oath of office internally in the near future to formally establish the new Provincial Government. However, since the Central Government has not yet appointed an oath-taking commissioner, the date has not been decided. In order to avoid interruption of government affairs, Chairman He Chengjun took office on June 1 together with Liu Wendao, member of the Provincial Committee and Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Wu Guozhen, Director of the Finance Department, Fang Dazhi, Director of the Construction Department, Huang Jianzhong, Director of the Education Department, and committee members Chen Guangzu and Peng Jieshi. At the same time, Liu Wendao and Wu Guozhen took over all the civil affairs and finance departments. The social and financial bureaus of the Hankou Municipal Government were also merged into the two departments respectively. Most of the staff were also transferred to serve in the two departments. Except for those who resigned or left, very few of the original staff of the two departments were retained. It is estimated that He Fuzhou was appointed as the chief secretary of the Civil Affairs Department, Dai Weixia as the chief of the First Section, Bi Weiru as the chief of the Second Section, Duan Xishan as the chief of the Third Section, and Huang Jiwei as the chief of the Fourth Section. In the Finance Department, Fan Shi was appointed as the secretary and chief of the First Section, Gui Jingqiu as the secretary and chief of the Second Section, and He Xicai as the chief of the Third Section. On the Provincial Government side, Hua Jueming, the chief secretary, was reassigned as the chief secretary of the Third Army Corps. The position of chief secretary of the Provincial Government was concurrently held by committee member Peng Jieshi, who was appointed by Chairman He. After the committee members took office, they convened the first discussion meeting on the 2nd to exchange opinions and resolved more than ten important cases, which will be implemented after the official meeting of the committee members and the subsequent ratification, including (1) abolishing the Provincial Clearing Bureau, (2) approving the resignation of Xiong Bingkun, chairman of the Audit Committee, and ending the committee, (3) the retention or abolition of the public security sub-bureaus and finance bureaus of each small county will be handled by the civil affairs and finance departments at their discretion, (4) reorganizing the Hubei Zhongshan Daily, with Hua Jueming as the president, and requesting the central government to send senior officials to Hubei to supervise the oath-taking ceremony as soon as possible. The financial situation of Hubei Province has reached the point of exhaustion. The urgent payments include 200,000 yuan for the political expenses of various institutions in April, 70,000 yuan for maintenance expenses in May, and 100,000 yuan for maintenance expenses in the first half of June. Notices have been issued for payments of 710,000 yuan pending funds, and 300,000 yuan for bandit suppression expenses, totaling about 1.4 million yuan. According to the plan of Director of Finance Wu Guozhen, urging the collection of 300,000 yuan of the Central Government's cooperation funds in May and appropriating 1 million yuan from the Municipal Treasury can barely cover the expenses. However, how to raise funds in the future is not optimistic. Wu relies on the Hankou municipal tax. The monthly income of Hankou is only several hundred thousand yuan, and the salaries of the police officers of the Public Security Bureau already account for the majority. The public works and education aspects have also been reduced as much as possible. Although the abolition of the municipal government only saves more than ten thousand yuan per month, the remaining amount is only a few tens of thousands, which is far from enough to make up for the provincial treasury. In addition, the Hankou Chamber of Commerce has expressed its unwillingness to use the municipal tax for provincial purposes. It is not yet known whether there will be resistance in the future, which depends on how Wu responds (June 2).</p>

<p>Military Expenses and Finance Are Largely Resolved</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since Yan Xishan stepped down in Shanxi Province, if the two items of military expenses and finance in the aftermath can be properly resolved, then everything else will be easily solved. The result of Shang Zhen and others' request for subsidies from Commanders-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang in Peiping is that the military expenses have been temporarily settled. Therefore, the current degree of resolution is (1) the compilation expenses of the Shanxi Army are reluctantly issued from the 2 million cash brought by Shang Zhen in Peiping; (2) the salaries of the units of Song Zheyuan, Sun Dianying, etc. stationed in various counties in southern Shanxi will be directly allocated by the Deputy Command Headquarters from May, and from June 1, Shanxi will no longer be responsible for the supply of grain; (3) the advances for the purchase of grain, etc. by the former garrison troops in the counties of southern Shanxi will be fully repaid first with the 4 million grain loan raised by the provincial government this time; (4) in addition to the expenses from the income of Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces, Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang also promised to cooperate with 1 million yuan per month to subsidize the military expenses of the Shanxi Army in the future. Zhang has already telegraphed his approval to cooperate with 1.2 million yuan in May, ordering Shanxi Province to prepare a roster so that personnel can be dispatched to distribute the funds. As for the issue of financial reorganization, the provincial government held a special meeting yesterday and approved the draft of the financial reorganization measures proposed by the Finance Department, the draft of the simple regulations for the Shanxi Provincial Government to entrust the Shanxi Provincial Bank to issue convertible silver dollar notes, and the draft of the measures to withdraw the old provincial banknotes. The content of the motion has not been formally announced, but the Shanxi banknote issue, which is related to the lifeline of the entire population of Shanxi, may have a considerable hope of being resolved. It is rumored that the provincial government entrusted the provincial bank to issue convertible banknotes with a total amount of 10 million yuan, and the old provincial banknotes will be recovered in four installments. Gao Buqing will still be appointed as the general manager of the provincial bank to thoroughly reorganize the bank (May 31).</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Process of Resolving the Strike of Coal Merchants on the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Ge Guangting's Talk</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Zibo Zhangwei coal merchants unanimously went on strike from the 21st of last month due to opposition to the Jiaoji Railway's increase in freight rates. The two sides insisted until there was no perfect solution. Later, Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, arrived in Jinan from Beijing and jointly negotiated with the coal merchant representatives Yang Suwu, Zhuang Shuting, and Ding Jingchen on the freight rate issue, and the matter was resolved. It was also decided to resume transportation from June 1. Ge returned to Qingdao from Jinan yesterday (1st). According to his account of the resolution process, it was roughly stated that when he was in Beijing, he received repeated reports from the railway and knew the details of the coal merchants' strike. When he returned to Qingdao and passed through Jinan, the coal merchant representatives came to see him. He instructed the representatives that the Jiaoji Railway's price increase this time was carried out in accordance with the order of the Ministry. If the coal merchants believed that the burden was too heavy and there was a need to reduce it, they should also consult with the railway and forward it to the Ministry of Railways for instructions and approval. It can only be followed after it is submitted by the Ministry to the State Council for approval. Minister Sun is on his way to Guangdong, and no one is in charge of the Ministry's affairs. It is not possible to handle it in a short time. The coal merchants should not take suicidal measures such as closing down and striking. If the strike problem causes other unfortunate incidents, the coal merchants may not be able to shirk their responsibility as the instigators. After hearing this, the representatives admitted their mistakes and immediately discussed the resumption of transportation. As a result (1) The coal merchants resumed transportation first. Before the Ministry's order was received, the coal transportation, whether for export or domestic sales, was temporarily priced according to the summer price reduction method, and a 20% rebate was collected at the end of each month, and the original scheduled summer price reduction of four months was extended to six months. (2) The Railway Bureau telegraphed the price reduction method to the Ministry for instructions. If the Ministry's order only allows a 10% or 15% rebate, the overcharged amount should still be returned. (3) The negotiation of the freight rate should still be submitted to the Ministry for approval. The coal merchants also agreed to the above three items and immediately telegraphed the stations along the route to comply. As a result, the coal merchants began to resume transportation from the 1st, and the coal merchant strike came to an end (June 2).</p>

<p>Hangzhou News: The case of Xu Zhuoran's assassination in Fujian has been under the jurisdiction of the Hangzhou District Court and has been tried many times, but no verdict has been reached. It is now known that after the final debate at the end of last month, the verdict was announced on the 5th of this month.

<p>The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau has submitted a special request to the Construction Department because the Xiaochang Road passes through important towns in eastern Zhejiang or areas with dense populations and abundant products. In the future, the construction of highways in this province and the county roads built by various counties should be connected to the stations of the Xiaochang Railway, so that the transportation industry can be mutually developed.</p>
<p>The county magistrate of Deqing has submitted a plan to remedy the silk industry to the Construction Department, requesting that silkworm-raising villages be organized in the counties of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Shaoxing, where sericulture is flourishing, so that villagers can cooperate to adopt improved silkworm breeds and organize cocoon-selling cooperatives to prevent the abuses of cocoon merchants.</p>
<p>The output of silk cocoons in Haiyan County is the best in western Zhejiang. In this session, most of the cocoon shops in the county's villages have not opened, and it is inconvenient for silkworm farmers to sell cocoons. They all use local methods to reel fine silk, and are now rushing to Xieshi and Chang'an to sell. The silk market in Xieshi is 512 yuan per hundred taels, and Chang'an is 545 yuan per hundred taels, which is better than the price in Hangzhou. The silk industry in Hangzhou is unlikely to improve.</p>

<p>The Provincial Committee urges the collection of business tax. The local Business Tax Bureau has been established for several months and has completed the registration, but the date of collection is still pending due to various reasons. Today, the Provincial Government specially sent Commissioner Xu to Songjiang to meet with the two county chiefs. After that, he summoned the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and representatives of various trade associations to the county to discuss the matter. The attending representatives Zhou Heyun, Cai Zhongyu, Zhang Jiliang, Zhang Mengxing, Yang Zhimin, etc. Commissioner Xu of the Provincial Committee attended the meeting and announced the purpose of convening the meeting, roughly saying that he had been instructed by the Provincial Chairman to come to Songjiang to urge the collection and declare that merchants can get many benefits from early collection, otherwise, if they are repeatedly urged and ignored, they will inevitably check and suspend their accounts, which would be troublesome. Please decide on the date of collection immediately. The representatives all said that the business amount investigated now is mostly inconsistent. If it is not carefully checked and clarified, how can it be collected rashly? And because the tax rate is unclear, please ask the Provincial Committee for instructions. It cannot be done by the industry. The two sides exchanged opinions with each other. Director Shen of the Finance Bureau announced that after the Director of the Business Tax Bureau comes to Songjiang, another meeting will be convened for discussion before the meeting will be adjourned. It is heard that as of today, none of the 61 counties in the province have started to collect taxes. Therefore, the merchants here should collect business tax, but it can only be determined after the various prerequisites are resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Suzhou <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>There are still problems with the collection of business tax. The provincial government originally scheduled to collect business tax in this county on April 1, but there are still disputes on the merchant side, so it has not been implemented to this day. It is now learned that the Finance Department, due to financial difficulties, cannot delay the collection of business tax. Therefore, Commissioner Fang Boxiao was specially sent to Suzhou to work with County Chief Huang and Director Wang to urge the collection. The County Chamber of Commerce invited more than a dozen industry representatives to a meeting the day before yesterday to discuss that the tax rate and the date of collection should be handled in accordance with the Shanghai market. Please ask Commissioner Fang to go to the province to present opinions to the department, and plan to convene a joint meeting with Nantong, Jiangdu, Dantu, Wuxi, and other four counties to reach a consensus. The bureau has jointly issued a notice that if the estimated amount of capital and annual business income filled in before June 15 is concealed and underreported, permission will be granted to come to the bureau to correct it, otherwise penalties will be imposed after the deadline. Also, this spring's cocoon season was not good. Since the bureau was ordered to start collecting silk cocoon business tax in advance, although the cocoon merchants were waiting to see due to Wuxi's opposition, they were persuaded by the assigned personnel and immediately understood. Now, the cocoon merchants have recognized and paid the tax, including four households in Xishan, two households in Xiangshan Guangfu, two households in Dongshan Puzhuang Hengjing Xukou Shanrenqiao Huguan Shiqiaozhen Wangting Baima Hexu Menpanmen, etc., each household recognizing and paying business tax of about 250,000 yuan. There is still one household in Panmen day rent sector that has not been resolved. It can be seen that this year's spring cocoon business is indeed much less than in previous years.</p>
<p>Dispute over car fare leads to murder. Tao Shiliang, a western doctor at Yongfu Bridge in Hengma Road outside Yanmen, has been serving as a military medical officer in the transport team and knew Bao Qizhong. After Tao left the military life, he came to Suzhou with Bao Qizhong to set up a medical office in Yongfu Bridge, with Bao serving as a nurse. Tao went to Xixi the day before yesterday for business. Yesterday (the 5th) morning at about 4 o'clock, he took the Nanjing night express train from Xixi back to Suzhou. After arriving at Suzhou Station, Tao hired a rickshaw driven by Li Yuhai from Yancheng to return home. At that time, the car fare had not been discussed. When he arrived home and got off the car, Tao found that he only had 24 steel yuan. He planned to go to the money shop to exchange for foreign currency, but the money shops were not open because it was still early. Tao immediately entered the door and ordered Bao to add 12 copper yuan. The rickshaw driver Li Yuhai requested a premium because he was pulling a passenger here early in the morning, which Tao refused, causing a conflict. At that time, Bao wanted to use violence against the rickshaw driver, so the rickshaw driver resisted and hit Bao's face hard. Bao fell to the ground and died immediately. When Tao Shiliang saw that the rickshaw driver had caused a major disaster, he reported to the nearby Public Security Third Branch Second Station. The gatekeepers of the station rushed to arrest the murderer Li Yuhai and took him to the station. Inspector Wang Shiyi summoned the principal Tao Shiliang to the station to inquire about the process. According to his confession, the deceased Bao Qizhong was 24 years old, from Zhenjiang, and had not yet married. The rickshaw driver Li Yuhai confessed that he was 29 years old, from Yancheng. After Wang asked according to his confession, he ordered the guarantor to report to the local court for inspection. The court's inspection office sent Prosecutor Qian to inspect at 3 pm. After the inspection, it was confirmed that the deceased died from being beaten. After the inspection, Tao Shiliang notified his family to come to Suzhou to handle the funeral and bought a coffin to collect the body.</p>
<p>The silk weaving industry requests to improve the tax system. On the 5th, the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce received a report from the Yarn Satin Shop Industry and the Iron Machine Silk Weaving Industry Association stating that although the government has abolished the likin and exempted the consumption tax, the domestic customs tax system has not been improved, which is still enough to harm merchants. Please transfer it to the Ministry of Finance and Industry to imitate the foreign goods imported and pay a tax throughout the country to exempt from duplicate taxes to help merchants in trouble. The association immediately transferred the report to the Ministry of Finance and Industry for review and instruction.</p>
<p>Investigating Japanese merchants for privately collecting fresh cocoons. Japanese merchant Ruifeng Silk Factory sent personnel to hire rural boats to privately collect fresh cocoons in the rural Guangfu area of Suzhou. When transporting them to Suzhou, they were detained by the water police stationed in Fanmulu. The Chinese Wu Yusun, who was escorting the cocoons, fled without a trace. The National Goods Relief Association convened a meeting on the 5th and decided to request the government to order the subordinates to prevent such incidents from happening again, and to arrest and interrogate the traitor Wu Yusun.</p>

(4) North Road: Zhangcun Gongxieshing has the most goods, receiving about 120 loads of cocoons, and the cocoon price is as high as 80 yuan, and the secondary goods are 60 yuan. The Gongtailong and other cocoon shops in Sitou have very few goods, and the price is 65 yuan. The Youjiadan Huinong cocoon shop set the price at 80 yuan because it did not receive enough goods, but it only received more than a dozen loads of cocoons every day.</p>

When Pan was ordered to be transferred to the Finance Bureau of Jiangning and was handling the handover, Li immediately telegraphed the provincial authorities, falsely accusing Pan of absconding with funds. He also detained a certain director of the Finance Bureau. Later, fearing that the provincial authorities would investigate and find no evidence, Li colluded with the Chamber of Commerce to fabricate evidence. It was said that Pan had returned a loan of 35,000 yuan in firearms to the Chamber while in office. Li instructed the Chamber to only acknowledge receiving 30,000 yuan, claiming that Pan had embezzled the remaining 5,000 yuan. The Chamber, having issued a receipt for the full amount, politely refused the request, finding it inconvenient to forge the receipt. Li, frustrated in his attempt, became angry and ordered the county police to arrest five members of the Chamber's standing committee: Shi Junsheng, Di Dechen, Hu Guoguang, Sun Zuze, and Peng Jin. He planned to force them to admit to the falsehoods. Fortunately, Peng Jin was out of town and avoided arrest, while the others were imprisoned. A wave of resentment swept through the city, almost leading to a market strike. Police were dispatched to inspect postal and telecommunications facilities and transportation docks. Peng, upon hearing the news, disguised himself and fled to Changzhou, and yesterday came to the province to appeal to various parties. Pan Keping, the Director of Finance of Jiangning, also came to the province to request an investigation after hearing that Li had falsely accused him of absconding with public funds. Yesterday morning, Peng Jin went to the Provincial Civil Affairs Department to present the truth about the detention of the standing committee members of the Chamber. Jin, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, and Hu, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, both expressed that Li's actions were absurd. They immediately telegraphed Li, ordering him to release the four standing committee members of the Chamber and planned to send personnel to Liyang to investigate. Because Li accused Pan of absconding with public funds, the Finance Department dispatched Director Ye yesterday to conduct an investigation.</p>
<p>New Customs Superintendent Takes Office: The newly appointed Zhenjiang Customs Superintendent, Jia Guilin, assumed office yesterday after receiving the order from the Ministry of Finance. No changes were made to the internal staff. Jia previously served as a secretary at the Ministry of Finance and was largely responsible for drafting the new tariff regulations. It is said that he will make further contributions to improving customs affairs after taking office.</p>
<p>Personnel Changes in the Finance Department: Wang Bi, the former Inspector of the Eighth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department, has been reassigned as the Director of the Nantong Finance Bureau due to a vacancy. Ye Yongqing, a staff member, has been appointed to succeed him. Ye traveled to the district yesterday after receiving his appointment for inspection. Xu Ruzhen was also appointed as a staff member of the Second Section and started working at the Department yesterday.</p>

<p>Village Head Arrested for Extortion: A certain village head of Houtang Village in the Third District recently extorted 60 yuan from a citizen, Xie, under a false pretense. Xie was unable to raise the money immediately and asked his neighbor, the village head, to act as a guarantor and wrote a promissory note with a deferred payment date. Xie later became depressed by the unsigned note and reported the village head's extortion to the county government. Magistrate Fu Ji interrogated the plaintiff, defendant, and witnesses in court, but the statements of both sides made it difficult to reach a verdict. To clarify the facts, Magistrate Hong entrusted the matter to a certain agency for investigation. He has also personally visited the village for investigation. It has been verified that the extortion is true. This morning (the 3rd), the village head was summoned to the county government under the pretext of a conversation and was taken into custody by the police.</p>

<p>Gangsters Send Letters Demanding a Huge Sum of Money: Jia Songping, a salt merchant in Wucheng Lane in this city, has received three threatening letters from gangsters in recent days. The letters, signed Zhou Mengxia, claim that he is a member of a certain army and is currently lacking funds. They admire Jia's public spirit and wealth and demand a temporary loan of 50,000 yuan to be delivered to a person wearing a gray cloth robe, a straw hat, and carrying a civilized umbrella outside the Situ Temple in the west gate, all in ten-yuan bills. If he wishes to reduce the amount, he can send his son to the military headquarters at Situ Temple or the division headquarters at Ganquan Mountain to negotiate. If he does not comply with the letter, they will use the most severe means to deal with him. It is reported that the victim has sent the original letter to the authorities for a thorough investigation and requested protection.</p>
<p>Tao Xuezhong and Others Sent Back to Litai for Interrogation: Tao Xuezhong, the head of the merchant militia of Xiannv Temple in Yi County, was previously accused by someone to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Security Bureau of colluding with bandits. Tao surrendered himself for interrogation at the director's office after hearing of the accusation. After being released on bail, the director's office received a report from the Dongtai County Government that bandits, including Xue Sheng and Tao Wenmin, and six others had been arrested in the county and all confessed to being involved with Tao Xuezhong. The director ordered the six convicts including Tao Xuesheng to be sent to the office, but the investigation had not been completed. The Dongtai County submitted a request to have Tao Xuezhong and the six convicts sent back to the county for interrogation. The director's office approved the request and ordered the guarantor to hand over Tao to the county. The county specially sent Liu Zhixun, the captain of the second police squad, along with twenty armed police officers, to Yangzhou to pick up the suspects. They arrived at the director's office at six o'clock this morning (the 4th) and took Tao Xuezhong and the other seven, along with the original interrogation records from the director's office.</p>

<p>Suicide of a Traveler at the West Lake Hotel: A young traveler came to the West Lake Hotel in Xinchang Market at 11:00 PM on the 3rd of this month and booked Room 112. He identified himself as Cheng Ziwen, a 21-year-old from Nanjing, and carried a suitcase. After entering the room and going to bed, he had not gotten up by noon the next day. The waiter called him but received no response. Upon entering the room, the waiter found the young man's face pale, and a broken bottle of sleeping pills was on the floor next to the bed. He quickly informed the front desk, who reported it to the Second District Police Station. The police station dispatched a health officer, Wu Jiaxing, who found the guest unable to speak. He hired a car to send him to the Hangzhou Hospital for treatment. However, the poisoning was too severe, and he died at 5:00 AM on the 5th. The traveler left behind five letters, a medical lecture, a small wallet containing five yuan and two jiao in silver coins, two military notes, a steel watch, a fountain pen, a medical badge, a pair of leather shoes, a copper basin hat, and a Western-style suit. After investigation, the guest's real name was Chen Huan, and he was studying at the Provincial Medical School. His brother, Chen Zhongken, is the director of the military medical department at the Nanjing Garrison Command. The cause of death is believed to be related to love. The contents of the letters to the principal and friends are unknown. At 2:00 PM, Prosecutor Jiang Lichun from the court led the coroner and others to examine the body and confirmed that he died from poisoning. The letters were kept in the court, and the deceased's cousin, Chen Gao, and younger brother, Chen Yunxi, prepared a coffin and arranged for the body to be temporarily placed in the Siming Guild Hall while they telegraphed his brother in Hangzhou.</p>

<p>Sister-in-law and Sister Fight over Love, Attempt Suicide by Jumping into River: In Linjiang Village, eight miles from Yaqian in Dongxiang, a man named Shi set up a small school in the Land Temple and hired Ge, a young and handsome man from Xinchang, as a teacher. Ge fell in love with Yin Xing, a Lin girl in the back house. Feng Gu, Yin Xing's sister-in-law, also became involved with Ge. The teacher was enjoying the happiness of a double love affair. On the 31st of last month, the sisters-in-law suddenly had a lovers' quarrel. Yin Xing, feeling ashamed, jumped into the river to end her life. Seeing the trouble she caused, the sister-in-law also jumped into the pond behind the temple. Neighbors heard the commotion and rushed to rescue them, but they were both barely alive.</p>
<p>Autonomy Tax Collection Suspended Due to Reorganization: The Xiaoshan autonomy tax was ordered by the county government last year to be collected by the village councils to fund the autonomy expenses. Later, due to poor management, reorganization officers were sent to the villages to collect the tax and deposit the funds with the county for future distribution. Unexpectedly, the reorganization officers did not achieve any results, and the village councils completely stopped collecting the tax. The collection has been suspended for five months. Now, the district offices have no funds and are unable to fill the deficit, so the district chiefs are constantly demanding funds from the county government.</p>

<p>Huayang River Dredging Measures Involving Seven Counties in Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces: The Huayang River dredging project, which concerns the water conservancy of the three provinces of Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi and seven counties, has been stalled for a long time. Recently, the Anhui Provincial Government approved the consultation order from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and ordered the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments to draft appropriate measures to be submitted. The two departments have now drafted measures and jointly submitted them to the provincial government. The content is divided into three steps: First, according to Jiangxi's proposal, the three provinces will send personnel to jointly conduct an on-site survey to formulate a measurement plan and budget. Second, according to Anhui's proposal, the original plan for cost sharing in 1919 (Anhui Province shares 51%, Hubei Province shares 39%, and Jiangxi Province shares 10%) will be followed, and the three provincial governments will be responsible for the measurement expenses and organize a measurement team to conduct precise measurements and finalize the construction plan. Third, according to Hubei's proposal, the beneficiary owners and gentry of the three provinces and seven counties will jointly raise funds for construction, so that both the government and the people can be considered, and practical actions can be taken. The provincial government believes that the proposed measures are largely in line with the opinions of Hubei and Jiangxi provinces and are feasible. Yesterday, it informed the Hubei and Jiangxi provincial governments of the situation and requested that they verify and respond so that the river dredging project can be gradually realized.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Cancellation of "Billion" and "Trillion" in Mathematical Calculations <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a request from the Chung Hwa Book Company regarding the proposal to discontinue the use of "billion" and "trillion" beyond ten thousand in the decimal counting system, issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities. The order states that the Chung Hwa Book Company submitted a report stating that the method of dividing numbers above a thousand in the decimal counting systems of China and foreign countries has been different. China has two methods of division. One is to use "ten thousand" as "billion" and "million" (that is, ten "billion") as "trillion," with one section of seven digits per unit. The other is to use "ten thousand ten thousand" as "billion" and "ten thousand billion" as "trillion." The calculation is one, ten, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, ten ten thousand, one hundred ten thousand, one thousand ten thousand, "billion," ten "billion," one hundred "billion," one thousand "billion," "trillion," ten "trillion," one hundred "trillion," one thousand "trillion," with one section per four digits. The world's common section system uses three digits per section, so there is a slight change per thousand. Therefore, "ten thousand" is ten thousand, and one million is another name called "Million." Ten thousand ten thousand is called "Billion." In Chinese books, the numbers above ten thousand often use names such as "billion" and "trillion." The so-called "billion" refers to ten thousand or ten thousand ten thousand. The so-called "trillion" refers to one million or ten thousand billion, which is impossible to determine. Now, if a seven-digit section system is used, another name must be given above "trillion." The original word "ladder" has long been out of use and seems unfamiliar. If a four-digit section system is used, although it is neat and unified, it is not very consistent with the world's common three-digit section system. Now, the numbers in the official accounting and statistics system have uniformly adopted a three-digit section system, while the ordinary text and even the textbooks in schools still use names such as "billion" and "trillion." Numbers are used to seek accuracy and avoid ambiguity, but now the use of words like "billion" and "trillion" increases inaccuracy, which is contradictory to the application of numbers. The agency has realized this, and after editing the book, it plans to remove the ambiguous words of "billion" and "trillion." All numbers above ten thousand are cumulatively prefixed above the word "ten thousand," such as ten ten thousand, one hundred ten thousand, one thousand ten thousand, ten thousand ten thousand, and one hundred thousand ten thousand. Although it feels a bit cumbersome, the calculation of the number seems more accurate. But this is a matter of custom, and the agency does not dare to specialize. Whether there is a case should be submitted to the unit for deliberation. If it is considered feasible, should it be promulgated nationwide to show uniformity? Otherwise, please ask the unit to verify and indicate a method to follow. For the above reasons such as all decimal counting systems above ten thousand do not use "billion" and "trillion" digits that are cumulatively prefixed above the word "ten thousand," is it feasible? I respectfully ask your unit to review and approve the instructions to follow. In addition to the investigation of the request to not use the two words "billion" and "trillion" and to use the cumulative prefix above the word "ten thousand" for all decimal counting systems, it is not without merit that a counting term has not been determined before it should be temporarily approved. If the bureau has already adopted the two words "billion" and "trillion" in each textbook, it should uniformly follow the revision in the next edition. In addition to the order to comply to show uniformity, please inform, etc., and it is hereby ordered that the provincial offices follow the same command.</p>

<p>Order all bookstores to send reviewed books for reference.</p>
<p>Strictly order not to use textbooks that have not been reviewed by the Ministry of Education again.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read a news item in the education news column of your newspaper about the Education Bureau unifying textbooks. The Bureau previously found that most schools in the city use textbooks reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education, but quite a few still use unreviewed textbooks. To ensure the unification of teaching materials in all schools in the city, the Bureau ordered all bookstores to submit two copies of textbooks that have been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education for display and reference. At the same time, it strictly ordered all schools not to use unreviewed textbooks again. This is the Bureau's intention to unify teaching materials. Fearing that the public is unaware of the truth, I ask that you make a correction. To the Shin Pao Newspaper Office.</p>

<p>Yu Tianguang of Shanghai was originally an old player. This time, John's and Shanghai matched. John's won two rounds and Shanghai won one round. John's player Huang Jiayin, who was fighting against Yu Tianguang, had no highlights at all. Shanghai believed that John's deliberately used a weak general to hold down the tiger and maintain its strength, so Yu Tianguang's hero had no place to use. Therefore, Shanghai protested, and the executive committee decided that Yu Tianguang must have another match with John's winning generals Luo Min'e and Zhu Zichang. If Luo Zhu is defeated, John's will be deliberately playing tricks, his qualifications will be cancelled and a fine of 20 yuan will be imposed.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Origin of Dominoes <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Achen</p>
<p>Dominoes were once an elegant game, but now they are used for gambling, which goes against the original intention of their creation. Legend has it that dominoes were created during the Xuanhe reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty and the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong. Emperor Gaozong issued an edict to promote their use throughout the land, and the literati of the time regarded studying their various uses as a pastime during their leisure time with poetry and wine. However, they all played alone in bright and clean rooms, unlike modern gamblers who shout and cheer. Although their composition is based on the combinations of twenty-one points and thirty-two cards, their unpredictable variations create endless interest. Although those who play them may be likened to those who build a cart behind closed doors, the resulting mental pleasure surpasses that of entering the market of the Five Capitals. I will now briefly describe what I know:</p>
<p>Belonging to literature, there are card lyrics, card poems, card songs, card tunes, card correspondence, card notes, card letters, card classics, etc. If even one card is incorrect, a complete chain can be formed, unlike the clever combination of five pieces.</p>
<p>Belonging to superstition, there are card divination, card lessons, card tallies, card signs, feng shui cards, fortune-telling cards, treasure-hunting cards, treasure vault cards, judgment cards, dragon-breaking, and the forward, backward, left, and right linking calculation methods specifically for wine, lust, wealth, and anger. There are also so-called tortoise dismantling and sky nine hitting, which are the easiest to perform and are within everyone's capabilities. It is said that the most spiritual divination is the tooth card divine number of Zhuge Liang and the tooth card Bagua of Liu Bowen. If the tooth card divine number is used as the theory, then dominoes already existed in the Han Dynasty, and there was no need to wait for Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty to issue an edict to promote it throughout the land. Such is what I have heard, but whether the tooth card divine number was created by Marquis Wu requires further verification.</p>
<p>Belonging to the humorous, there are cards presenting grievances, cards responding to official documents, cards interrogating confessions, red maiden's card to express love, and Liu's four-door singing, etc. The recently popular card-appearing essay is said to be created by Yuan Suiyuan. The above essays all use the style of points, the amount, the color of the collaboration, and chants with unrestrained and extraordinary four-six sentences. The entire structure can form a chain different from the clever combination of five pieces.</p>
<p>Belonging to emotion, there is Meng Jiangnu searching for her husband for thousands of miles, Madam Sun silently thinking of her husband in Jingzhou, thinking of her husband and shedding tears (commonly known as thinking of ten pairs), Miss E eloping and Qinger patching a hundred na, etc. However, the item coordination is separate from the clever combination of the five pieces, but is only required to form a pair, but still requires thirty-two sheets to be interconnected, but the difference is that there is no linking skill.</p>
<p>Belonging to the martial arts. There are five levels to fight. Guan Gong cuts six generals through five passes. As well as loyal ministers and rebels. Attacking the Tianmen formation and so on. Today's women and children all know that. Only the two kinds of fighting five passes and cutting generals five times and so on are known.</p>
<p>Belonging to art. There are eight auspicious rows of swastika, stacking flower baskets, picking double peaches, and building a road, and finding millet in the sea. The method is simple. There is no difference in relay racing. Only with two or six as the head and three or six as the tail. Yu was poor in the collocation of the number of months. There is still one more thirty-five or twenty-five.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned various uses of the game. Yu in more than ten years. Either through the oral narration of the first kindness. Or through the notes of friends and other friends. Or get in the ancient sages' copy and store it. In the autumn of the fourth year of the Republic of China. Yu was in a second-hand bookstore in Peiping. He once bought five volumes of the copybook of Baifa for a few silver dollars. According to experts, the paper was made in the Ming Dynasty and was supposed to be from the Ming Dynasty. Yu regarded it as an arch wall. Unfortunately, in the spring of the following year. Lost in the outer way. I still regret it.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Recent News from Shantou <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Auspicious Post from Shantou</p>
<p>I came to Shantou from Xiamen. It has been more than ten days now. Shantou is more than twice as large as Xiamen, but it may not be as prosperous.</p>
<p>The roads and buildings are fairly flat. Police are visible at all times. However, those who inquire about directions often shake their heads and stare blankly, unsure of what to say. This makes it difficult for newcomers to Shantou. I hope the authorities will provide training.</p>
<p>The number of newspapers is also more than double that of Xiamen. Major newspapers include the Shantou Daily, Lingdong Republican Daily, Xin Lingdong Daily, Chao Mei Xinbao, Minsheng Daily, Tiansheng Daily, Zhenyan Daily, and many others. The layout and arrangement are modeled after Hong Kong newspapers. Among them, the "Shantou Daily" has the widest circulation. "Tiansheng" and "Zhenyan" have a small readership because they have not been published for long. However, the compilation of Tiansheng is still good and is working hard to move forward, not without new opportunities. The compilation and printing of Zhenyan are inferior, and I am afraid it will be difficult to recover on its own. There are three small newspapers: "Shuangri," "Feng," and "Hanjiang." The former comes out every two days, and the latter two appear every three days. The compilation is like a Shanghai small newspaper. The competition is very fierce. Therefore, both the Shuangri and Feng typesetting and printing are excellent. Unfortunately, the city is smaller than Shanghai by an unknown amount. It is not easy to collect information. All newspapers are suspended on Sundays. On Mondays, each newspaper publishes a four-page tabloid-style supplement. It does not talk about politics and society, but only about romance. It is also a new type of separation.</p>
<p>The people of Shantou seem to have a strong love of gambling. Otherwise, how could there be so many treasure platforms that every road must have them. The door plaques all say "Silver Medal". Entering the door is all Fan Tan.</p>
<p>Flowers are divided into "Southern Words", Su Gang, "Provincial Prostitutes", and local "Chao Prostitutes" three types. It is further divided into special, upper, middle, three, lower, and five classes. Depends on the amount of donations they pay. Shantou's donations are so numerous that there is nothing that is not donated. As for</p>
<p>Recreation is far inferior to Xiamen. Theaters are only "Zhenguang", "Guangtian", and "New Stage" three places. There is an "In Time" amusement park in the east, which only provides leisure for the lower class of society. The types of entertainment are also very few. The Shanghai Plum Blossom Dance Troupe once came here to perform for a dozen days. The New Stage was crowded with people and horses, which was very popular for a while. (It is reported that the troupe will leave for Guangzhou on the 17th to perform at the Provincial Education Association) It is good that the people of Shantou often compete to visit when they hear that there are novel songs and dances</p>

<p>— Wang Qiangcheng</p>
<p>The Shanxi Grand Theater hired the Liang Sisters Dance Troupe to perform various dances starting on May 28th. I had nothing to do on Saturday, so I went to the theater with Mr. Wang Feilong and Mr. Tao Renyan, bought tickets, and entered. A film was already showing. The film was quite profound in its intention and was divided into three segments: (1) death for a woman who pleases; (2) divorce due to money; (3) nearly escaping a disaster for diamonds. It is greatly alarming that the commonplace man and foolish woman of recent times would be obsessed with money. At the end of the film, the dance, Competition of Pearl Dance, was performed. The exquisite posture and beauty can be called unique in Shanghai. It is a pity that the music could not be synchronized, so there were slight regrets. After the first scene was completed, Brother Feilong accompanied me to the backstage. Sai Zhu cried and said that he almost danced wrong today because of the music. A young man raised his voice and said, "I played the piano. Moreover, Ms. So-and-so came to inform us. It was the fault of Ms. So-and-so, not the fault of our music!" After a long argument, it was only after Mr. So-and-so rebuked the young man that it stopped.</p>
<p>News from the Publishing World: Since the closure of the Yi Bao and Jinghua small newspapers in the capital's small newspaper industry, there has been a downturn. Recently, Zhu Zhu Zhan Qiuyun Yong Juexian and others initiated a three-day publication named Xiaoxiao Bao. Most of the writers are well-known figures in Beijing, such as Chen Dabei Zhang Huijian Li Lichen and others. The compilation style is especially unique. It is reported that it has been published on June 1.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's Travels Around the Yellow Sea (21), the station of Odawara Station in the third line was mistaken for a county. This is specially corrected.</p>
<p>New News from the Literary and Artistic World: As the summer heat gradually arrives and fans and leaves are put on the market, Shanghai calligraphers and painters Zhang Yuguang, Wang Zhongshan, Xiong Songquan, Ye Weixin, Gao Shangzhi, Xu Xiaochun, Shen Yizhai, Zhu Wenhou, Wang Yixian, Guo Jilan, Li Lengran, Hong Lisheng and other twelve people are each exhibiting more than 1,000 pages of their favorite folding fans from next Tuesday for three days at the Ningbo Association. At that time, there will also be inexpensive sales of various family painting manuals in order to form a bond with calligraphy and painting. (Snow)</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>One day, I went to visit the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun and received a warm reception from them. As soon as I entered, it was like entering a bookstore. Their printed materials, apart from daily newspapers, were very numerous. There were annual publications such as the Asahi Yearbook, the International League Yearbook, the Sports Yearbook, the Japanese Art Yearbook, the Japanese Photography Yearbook, the Japanese Film Yearbook, the Asahi Economic History, the International Photography Collection, the Asahi Diary for Young Men and Women, Present Day Japan, and other periodicals: Asahi Shimbun Reduced Edition (published on the 5th of each month), Films and Performing Arts Asahi, Children's Asahi (both published on the 1st of each month), Asahi Pictorial, Weekly Asahi (both weekly), Asahi Sports (twice a month). There were correspondence publications, which they called lectures: Asahi Everyday Conversation Lecture, Popular Medicine Lecture, Asahi Public Lecture. There were series of books: Asahi Family Series, Asahi Political and Economic Series, Asahi Sports Series, History of Meiji and Taisho, and various other individual books.</p>
<p>I visited the grand auditorium in the center of their building, which had 1,200 seats for listeners and various facilities for drama, broadcasting, sound recording, and movies. Public lectures and various performances were held there from time to time. There was also an exhibition hall with an area of one hundred square meters.</p>
<p>Their editorial office was equipped with a transmission machine in the air for automatic transmission of documents, which was both quick and labor-saving.</p>
<p>Their printing department had fifteen rotary presses of various types, with a total printing capacity of over 1.36 million sheets per hour.</p>
<p>There was a pigeon house on the roof with over a hundred pigeons. Pigeons were used for communication between Tokyo, Osaka, and Sendai every day. There were fixed devices and methods for how to place and hang the letter on the pigeon's body.</p>
<p>There was a telephoto room. If A and B are far away, if there are activities in A, such as meetings, celebrity travel, and other important activities, the film can be taken from B within 20 minutes and published in the B newspaper using the fastest method.</p>
<p>The entire building had 1,500 people, with rest areas, cafeterias, and public cafeterias attached to the business.</p>
<p>To tell another story, their president, Murayama Ryuhei, was still healthy at a high age and was very persevering and far-sighted. One year, the government ordered the suspension of publication for a few days because he published a certain case, and sales were inevitably affected. He suddenly had a whim and chose a day to have Asahi Shimbun send people to all the trams in the city that day to give away all the fares one by one. As a result, his reputation greatly increased, not only recovering the losses but also gaining extraordinary progress, which was more effective than any advertisement.</p>
<p>I admire the Asahi Shimbun in every way for being able to apply science and scientific methods, and I admire them even more for their far-sightedness, the precision of their organization, and the flexibility of their methods.</p>

<p>— Tianxu I Sheng</p>
<p>People from Hangzhou are good at making allegorical sayings. They often call something large and unexpected "Mu Lao Lao" (Wooden Old Man), without knowing the origin. A guest dining at Wang Runxing's saw someone tell the waiter, "Bring a Mu Lao Lao." At first, he didn't understand what it meant. Soon, a large bowl of fish head tofu was served. The guest, surprised by the abundance, laughed and said, "This is truly a Mu Lao Lao!" Little did he know that the name was actually a riddle. The character "Mu" (wood) hints at "Yu" (fish), and "Lao" (old) covers "Tou" (head) and "Doufu" (tofu). This is similar to the example in the novel *Jing Hua Yuan*, where "Jiang" is used to guess "Ya" (tooth). As for "Ma Qian" (before the horse), it's a hidden phrase of associative meaning. The hidden meaning is just the word "Kuai" (quick, enjoyable). The mutton soup rice at Xile Yuan also often uses riddles. For example, "Feng Tiao Yu" (favorable weather) for "Shen" (kidney) is a homophonic allegorical phrase, and "Liang Dong Er" (bright cave) for "Yan" (eye) is an associative and pictographic phrase. Restaurants also have many hidden phrases. A customer told the waiter, "San Xi Er, don't add Jin Sheng Li," using the character "Jiu" (wine) as a character-splitting riddle and "Shui" (water) as an allegorical saying. Waiters often call new customers "Lai Ma Er," using "Ma" to guess "Ren" (person), and "Er" as a word-assisting particle. Using "Sheng" (sacrifice) as a homophonic allegorical saying for "Sheng" (raw, fresh) is because it's a Hangzhou custom to sacrifice to the God of the Year. Restaurants usually serve a pig's head, eggs, and fish, called "Zhu Tou San Sheng" (pig's head three sacrifices). For ordinary festival sacrifices, pork is used instead of a pig's head, but it's simply called "San Sheng" without mentioning "pig's head." Eggs are used to replace chicken, as *Book of Rites* says, "Scholars and commoners do not kill for no reason." People in Hangzhou often say that the price of goods is surprisingly high, "Qiao Zhu Gan" (knocking bamboo poles), which is also a riddle. It's actually "Ji Tuo" (striking the clapper). The system of "Qiao Bangbang" (knocking the clapper) in Hangzhou involves cutting bamboo into flutes and hanging them on the chest, striking them with bamboo sticks. Every night around the second watch, the sound of the clapper is heard in the streets, called "Qi Geng" (starting the watch). Officials pronounce "Chi" for "Qi" and "Jing" for "Geng," so "Qiao Zhu Gan" is a riddle for "Ji Tuo," and "Qi Geng" is a homophonic allegorical saying for "Chi Jing" (startled), meaning that the high prices are enough to startle people. There's also something called "Pao Wang Gua" (peeling royal cucumber). Royal cucumbers are not valuable items, and people usually eat them with the skin on. Restaurants often prepare them for guests. If a guest asks for it to be peeled into shreds and mixed with sugar and vinegar, the price will be at least eight cents, even though it's only worth a few cents. Therefore, "Pao Wang Gua" is also another name for "selling foreign plates." Some say that when Governors Peng and Zuo were residing on the lake, their officials often wore yellow riding jackets. Whenever they entered a restaurant, they would anxiously call for the waiter, who would rush to serve them and often receive generous rewards. The price was even higher than selling foreign plates, buying "Qian Pan" (money plates). "Dong Yue Ban Diao" (moving and saying half a string) means that half a thousand official coins are worth half a tael of treasury silver, which is even higher than selling foreign plates.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Gold Prices Hovering <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The result is slightly better by one or two taels. Yesterday, the fifth, gold prices fluctuated slightly. They fell in the morning and then rose. The market then hovered above 800 taels, with a total market fluctuation of about eight taels. Looking back, the result was a slight increase of one or two taels. The intentions of those in the industry are still hesitant, and the market situation seems to be in a precarious state. The silver market has absolutely no honor or disgrace. The gold price fell slightly, and after the journey, it broke through 800 taels. Foreign exchange, both open and hidden, was even, and trading within the market was different, but there was not much volume. As for the gold price, there were three or four tael fluctuations, and it then broke out of 800 taels again. The market recovered due to the bravery of major players such as Dahuto, Daxing, Yongtian Yu, Yongyuan Xing, and Yongdeng, who bought vigorously. The exchange rate was also stable, and people's hearts were excited. In a moment, it suddenly rose by more than four taels. In the end, it returned to level, estimated to be above 804 taels.</p>
<p>The morning began with a fall and then saw a rise. From the early morning, the July opening price dropped by one tael and four qian to 801 taels and six qian. When the large strips and silver prices did not change, private telegrams had already risen by one-eighth of a journey. Because Yuan Mao Yong Sen Chang Yong Heng Yu and goods were all sold, the price fell from 02 taels and two qian to 798 taels. Then, it rose by three taels, as Qian Chang Xiang Dade Cheng and others bought in, and British gold was stable. Huabi bought 25. When the first order was announced, it was 801 taels and two qian, but the listed price did not change. Fuyu Chun Yuan Yong and others came to sell, so it immediately dropped to 799 taels and two qian. And from Maijia Li out of August British gold 25, instantly heard Huabi the same price absorbed, and Wanxing Shunli Tianfeng Yongyu Daheng Xing and others bought in, so it increased by four taels to 10 o'clock, 803 taels of money more. Dayong Feng sold out and suppressed it to 800 taels. From 09 to 10:30, it suddenly rose upward. British gold only closed 1875, the bank ate 1875 to 25 pair, and Tianyu Yong Qian Chang Xiang and others on the market to compete for purchase, it has been stimulated to rise four taels, 10:50 more for 04 taels and eight qian. Suddenly, Chang Sheng Yong Dai Wu sold, and the numbers followed suit. Especially because the bank sold British gold 1875 to 25, at 11:01 it fell to 02 taels. Only ten minutes later, it rose by one and a half taels. Heng Xing bought in. Around 11:30 it was 03 taels and a half. Afterwards, Yongfeng Zhifeng Yong Yuan Heng and hedging and other sales were only 800 taels and 03 qian. The noon closing was 008 qian, and then it was raised by more than one tael, estimated at two taels. Because retail investors chased and bought, the listed price was still calculated at 838 taels and two qian, with a discount of 38 taels to 33 taels more. The noon closing was 37 taels.</p>
<p>After hovering outside 800 taels, the afternoon market opened at 801 taels and a half, followed by one tael and nine qian. Yuancheng and others sold, and the Indian exchange rate was increased by one anna, which was small to 006 qian. Yong Yuan Xing bought in and reached more than 02 taels. It was extremely flat, and until after 3 o'clock, it seemed that there were more sellers and retreated to 008 qian. Dahing Yong Yuan Xing Zhi Feng Yong suddenly let go and jumped three taels at 3:40 to 03 taels and seven qian, and British gold also rose to close 1875. In an instant, Yongfeng Yuanheng and others sold out, and Taiwan also sold British gold 1875 to 25, which had already dropped to 01 taels and seven qian. At this time, Tianyu Yong entered the market and pushed up four taels instantly, and at 4:01 it was 05 taels and eight qian. Then, because buyers retreated and sporadic positions took advantage of this opportunity to sell, and Huabi Huifeng and others had sold British gold estimated at 1875, this sharp drop of two taels was estimated at 03 taels and seven qian. The market closed at 4:30 at 04 taels and four qian, which was one tael and four qian higher than the previous day. After entering, it was again done to around 04 taels. According to the entire market, the highest price was 805 taels and eight qian, and the lowest price was 798 taels, estimated to be seven taels and eight up and down. Goods early market one and a half taels noon closing one and a half taels afternoon one tael and four qian closing three taels and four qian listed price estimated to be suppressed 367 taels to 323 taels. The final 32 taels more on the books 801 taels of water subsidy 799 taels afternoon 802 taels. The transaction is extremely inconsistent. The transactions and deliveries of each number are unequal. The statistics such as Hengxing, Hengyu, Yuanxing Yong, Tong Taichang, Yu Da, Yuan Kangxiang, Tianyu Yong, Zhifeng Yong are all entered. Wanxing, Shunli, Dahing Yong, Futai Heng, Yuanmao Yong, Qian Changxiang, Chengfeng Yong have quite complicated entries and exits.

<p>Market Overview This summer, due to poor harvests in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, there were few silk cocoon collectors, resulting in the most impressive foreign market boom of the year turning into a bubble. Now that the season has passed and the height of summer is approaching, the market is usually quiet, so there is no possibility of foreign call loans rebounding, and there is no hope for a surge in trading activity. As for the trend of silver funds, there is no hope for an increase in color during this idle season. Generally speaking, the current market is already in a flat period.</p>
<p>Call Loan Prices Foreign call loans had a slightly better appearance in the morning, and there were slightly more buyers, so the call loan price was better by two hao and a half to seven qian two fen and nine li. The noon market was still soft, and the result was another good one hao and two halves to seven qian two fen eight li eight hao seven halves. Silver call loans Currently, the demand for silver funds is idle, and it is difficult to expect silver call loans to rise. The early and noon markets are the same at two fen, which is one fen smaller than the previous day.

<p>Securities Bond Prices Rebounded by Around One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, public debt futures were even quieter. The atmosphere was idle in the morning, and the market started to improve slightly in the afternoon. Many types of spot goods were opened, but the number of transactions was still not high. The market price was very stable. Later, the momentum of investors buying in was very enthusiastic, so they all turned to rise. However, the trend was still quite peaceful. After the price rose, sales transactions also increased slightly. As a result, it rose higher than the previous day by one yuan and several jiao.

<p>The yarn market is quiet, but American cotton is still rising. The local atmosphere is still softening. The actual sales are weaker than in the past few days, and 20s and 16s yarn are out of stock. Only 10s coarse yarn is stockpiled by various factories, and sales are sluggish. Therefore, the market atmosphere is oppressed. Sellers have no intention of shorting. Coarse yarn has the widest sales volume. The Yunnan and Guangdong gangs are less interested in doing business due to the obstacles in the current situation. As a result, the market is difficult to support. However, according to the overall situation, the yarn market has the possibility of consolidation, so some buyers' minds are still stable.</p>
<p>Human Label Flat Weary Human Label The opening price of the previous market followed the rise of foreign cotton by six or seven qian, and then fell two or three plates due to rumors and large households selling off. Each fell three four or five qian. The market was still tired in the afternoon, and each month was flat. The total daily transaction volume was 19,750 bales. Shenxin sold 1,100 bales, Tongyu 1,300 bales, and Yiyu 1,250 bales. Gengfeng bought 950 bales, Senkang 900 bales, Lichang 700 Longfeng 650 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left</p>

<p>The cotton market is stable because American cotton has risen continuously, and gold prices are stable, and exchange rates are not moving. The source of each route is dwindling. Sellers are flat, and Japanese merchants have been extensively purchasing and buying in large quantities in October and November. The number of packages is increasing. There are others who are still selling due to sluggish business, so the cotton market is even more difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Han Biao fell one and a half qian Exchange Han Biao The opening price of the previous market followed foreign cotton and was flat. When the market closed in the afternoon, it tended to fall by one qian and five fen. The transaction volume was 37,900 dan.

<h3 id="e144">The Decline of Food and Hexia Rice Market Turns Stable <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 20 boats of various gangs arrived at the Xinza Rice Market in Shanghai North. The market sales were in a slump. Changxi Beijin Fresh shouted for about a jiao. The transaction of middle-grade goods was not strong, and the market shape was flat. The price of Bo Rice was sharply reduced for days, and the goods were becoming scarce. The going and turning were active, and the prices shouted tightly for several fen. The sales of Yangba Jian were extremely busy, and the situation was firm. Lu Jian's sales were flat, and they were tending to stabilize like the port Jian. The situation was that the yuan's appetite was not transformed, and there were not many arrivals in the end. The situation of sitting down and secretly transforming was lacking in goods to market. Hexia Hujiao was about 5,000 dan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than a dozen numbers arrived in Shanghai South. The sales on this street were not good, and the goods were clearly priced and secretly sluggish. The going and turning of Xiji japonica were slightly weak, and Gao Ding's second-grade was tired. Su Tong Ping Li Yue japonica's general trend stabilized. The arrivals and sales were not launched. The unified market was only slightly moved by a few rural villages and shop stomachs. The market shape was similar to the previous day. In the South Gang, Qing Jiao Shipu Chonggu and other Bo Rice sources were also few here, but the base goods were still thick. Guest Gang's intention to enter the market was to choose high and ask for information. The situation was stable, and Du Yang's zero sales were not bad, and the goods were gradually tending to be low. The sales of white yuan rice wine were good because the Dragon Boat Festival had arrived, and the situation was lifted up to the vicinity.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Charming State of Period Wheat <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of period wheat was up and down. After the opening of the market in the morning and afternoon, the market of each month was slightly aroused by the report of the rise of foreign wheat. In this month, because most of the firms belong to the majority of the long side, although the new wheat has already entered the market, the aspect of arrivals is afraid that there will be no large number of departures, so the result in the future will inevitably have the suspicion of manipulating and raising prices. As for the situation of the new wheat Huaiqing Road area is less self-seen than in previous years. For example, Wuxi wheat samples are thin and weak, but the harvest is very good and the color is very shiny. In each producing area of Jiangbei, there are about eight years of scenery. After another ten days, the source can be seen gushing. As a result, this month rose five points more than the previous day, July rose three points, August rose four points, and September November rose one point. New wheat market Puzhen wheat Yesterday, another batch was loaded and the shouted price was three taels eight qian and five fen, which has not yet been matched to the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation of Ke Zi initially turned around, and then customers from Qinhuangdao and other places in the north bought it. This street also asked for it, and the market started to turn weak. Both the main customers and the Ke Yuan have appetites, but the small amount of goods is not worth going to, and the appetite is not worth going to. Yesterday, customers from Qinhuangdao Tianjin and other places continued to select and handle them, and it is estimated that 450 bags of secondary machine yuan in Hunan were opened at a price of 12 yuan and 2 jiao, 150 bags of medium-grade machine yuan in Jiangxi were opened at a price of 12 yuan and 8 jiao, and more than 400 bags of Hunan machine rice were opened at a price of 11 yuan, 3 jiao and 8 fen to 10 yuan and 9 fen. This street handled 150 bags of Jiangxi machine rice at a price of 11 yuan. 220 bags of Nanjing brown rice were priced at 8 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. There were no other transactions.</p>

<p>Foreign wheat has risen sharply... warships are plus five points according to the standard</p>
<p>Yesterday, the powder market tended to be tight again. The price of foreign wheat has risen by six or seven and eight jiao, etc. In the morning, the weather was very sultry, so people in general thought that if the rain was seen, the market would definitely rise, and the sharp rise of foreign wheat seemed to have no possibility of being abandoned. Therefore, after the market opened, it was better than the previous day. Fortunately, most of the bulls are laymen, and there are few actions from the real sales gang. Although the environment has improved, the increase in price is still not large. As for the spot market, warships, red and blue cars, etc., have added five points compared to the standard, which is similar to the previous month. Observation of the follow-up steps can be temporarily abandoned. As a result, this month rose 1 fen and 2 li half compared to the previous day, July rose 1 fen and 7 li half, August and September rose 2 fen, and October and November rose 1 fen and 7 li half.</p>

<p>The supply of Tongan longan has been lacking recently. It is reported that only a few hundred boxes of Jinan wheels from Taikoo Company were imported through Xiamen the day before yesterday. Yesterday, samples have been seen and dozens of boxes have been opened immediately. Because the particles of the upper village are not pure, there is not much up and down from the previous market, but the market is very small and the stock is very small, which feels very tight, and it is one or two taels higher than the previous market.</p>

<p>There are few excellent goods and many inferior goods in the market... Foreign cocoon prices open at 56 yuan. The weighing of the cocoon market in Changzhou's various markets and villages has been going on for three days. This year's cocoon production is better with late silkworms, and the cocoon quality is also better. However, the harvest is only 30%. There are few excellent goods and many inferior goods in the market, and the cocoon price is not high. The highest on the road is only 51 or 2 yuan. The cocoon market in Henglin and other places on the East Road are competing to collect excellent cocoons, and the prices reported are rising. Foreign high-quality goods were opened at 56 yuan yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday's local foreign village silk market was completely without a market edge. European and American silk sales were not moving, and each European village hoped to accumulate new silk at a low price, while silk factories have stopped work. Each silk merchant thinks that the principal is heavy and the loss is considerable, and they are all discarded and not sold. The market atmosphere is stagnant. Yesterday, each silk warp had a market but no market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Zhenmei green tea in Dongxiang, Wuyuan was continuously opened by Baitouzhuang Qianyi Ruichang and other lines, with the highest market price of 205 taels. However, the market conditions of middle and low Zhuang Zhenmei turned dull, and there were no transactions in Suian goods, and no Huabu goods were opened. The green tea market has shown a trend of raising and lowering. Although the stock of Qimen black tea is only more than 10,000 boxes, the Jardine Matheson Company, which has a very large sales appetite, has stopped searching for goods, and the market conditions are extremely deserted. Tea prices have fallen, and the market situation is very different from the past.</p>

<p>Sales of various colored woolen cloths have been somewhat active recently, while stored quantities of the blue-black color are dwindling. Therefore, the selling price has been temporarily increased slightly. Merchants from Tianjin and Sichuan continue to purchase more. The market is experiencing a significant shortage of two-tael, six-mace, seven-candareen grade, bald-face (inferior quality) blue-black woolen cloth. Consequently, sellers who wish to sell entire bolts of cloth are including the original color in the package.</p>

<p>Gauze is specially made for mosquito nets, hence it is also called net gauze. It has a width of eighty or ninety inches. The sales market in Shanghai is quite broad. Besides Hankou, some merchants from other regions also inquire about it, but most of it is manufactured in Shanghai and sent to them. Now that the weather is gradually becoming hot, it is the perfect time for it to sell well. Yesterday, the price of Taihe brand gauze was being quoted at eight mace and five fen, while Ruikang brand gauze was being quoted at nine mace.</p>

<p>Metal trading showed no progress yesterday, and the environment was precarious. Only a few military supplies, such as new lead wire and garden lead wire, had relatively good sales. The business of general merchandise was still sluggish. However, the market for British steel plates, which had been in the doldrums for a long time, suddenly showed bright prospects yesterday. It is said that about seven or eight hundred dan were traded. The prices were two mace and five fen at eight taels, eight mace, half a fen; seven taels, seven fen, half a fen; six taels, seven mace, half a fen; and one fen at six taels, two mace, half a fen. It is said that the seven-fen, half-fen grade was particularly active.

<p>Galvanized iron sheets, which had been in short supply for many days, have been arriving in a steady stream for the past two days. Therefore, there is no fear of shortages in the market. It is reported that warehouses such as Pudong New Taikoo, Three Diamonds, Huashun, Gonghexiang, etc., have loaded and arrived with 4,000 to 5,000 bundles of goods in April. However, the exchange rate fell secretly, so it did not have much impact on prices.</p>

<p>May Meet with Mo Dehui Via Russia; International Court of Justice Rescheduled for July 16th. Dr. Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, has been approved to attend the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague to handle the case of the German-Austrian Customs Union proposed by the Administrative Department of the League of Nations. He will take the Dalian Steamship Company's Tianjin Maru from Shanghai to Dalian at 2:00 PM today. From Dalian, he will take a train through the three northeastern provinces and Soviet Russia to The Hague. The ship is currently docked at the Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu. When the time comes, Wang will board the ship from there. Wu Kunwu, Counselor of the Judicial Yuan, Zhu Luhe, Minister of Justice, Wei Daoming, Mayor of Nanjing, and Zheng Yuxiu have all arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and will go to the wharf to see him off. Regarding his whereabouts after leaving Shanghai and the opening of the International Court of Justice, Wang told a New Sound News Agency reporter yesterday, "In addition to having my secretary, Xiao Jin, accompany me to Harbin, I have no one else traveling with me. After arriving in Harbin, I will have to stay for one or two days to wait for the Russian Consulate in Harbin to issue a passport to pass through Russia. Then, I will go west along Siberia to Moscow. If there is an opportunity, I will meet with Mo Dehui, the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Sino-Soviet Conference. However, as far as I know, the train only stops there for two hours, and the train from Siberia is often late. Therefore, it is not yet known whether I will be able to meet with Representative Mo. If the train is not late, there may be a chance; otherwise, I can only pass through there and go directly to Berlin. I have now received a telegram from the International Court of Justice notifying me that the opening date has been changed to the 16th of next month. Therefore, there is still plenty of time on the way. I plan to rest for three or four days in Berlin and then go to The Hague. I expect to arrive at the International Court of Justice by the end of this month, and I plan to return to China at the end of the year."</p>
<p>Mayor of the Capital Wei Daoming, Minister of Justice Zhu Luhe, and others arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing on the morning of the day before yesterday and arrived at the station at 5:00 PM.

Wang also gave a lengthy response, and the gathering ended happily at 2:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Xie Guanying, Secretary of the Judicial Yuan, because the President of the Yuan, Wang Chonghui, was scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Europe today to attend the International Court of Justice, Xie came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning.

<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Chen Shaokuan, Naval Vice-Minister and concurrently Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning.

(Q) Since no orders have been received, have there been any preparatory actions? (A) The Guangdong situation is being handled by the Central Government, which is striving for a peaceful resolution.

(Q) If there is a need to dispatch to deal with the matter, will the Navy order all naval ships to be transferred south to participate? (A) This matter depends on the extent of the situation. (Q) Is it true that the Yongji and Yongjian ships will first sail to Shantou within the next few days? (A) Yongjian will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (today).

Because of his busy official duties and physical labor, he came to Shanghai for rest after the National Assembly closed. Mr. Yang originally planned to return to Fujian to take charge of the government after a short stay, but he has not been able to do so due to the recurrence of hemoptysis after arriving in Shanghai. According to Yang's staff, who told the Riri News Agency reporter yesterday, Yang's body has always been weak, and he has been suffering from hemoptysis for many years due to official duties. They also said that Yang has moved from the residence to the Xiahui Nursing Home for recuperation. The date of his return to Fujian has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Resolution of the Bookbinding Industry Strike <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Full Resumption of Work Tomorrow</p>
<p>Suspension of Union Activities</p>
<p>Due to a wage increase movement, the bookbinding workers carried out the third strike, which has lasted for eight days. After the Public Security Bureau and the Social Bureau jointly issued an announcement ordering the resumption of work within three days, the various conditions were also negotiated yesterday. More than 600 Western-style bookbinding workers resumed work yesterday. More than 1,200 Chinese-style bookbinding workers are also scheduled to resume work tomorrow. The Party and government organs issued an announcement to suspend union activities and seal up the meeting place to wait for reorganization. The situation yesterday is recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Consultation Method: In order to quickly resolve the issue, Pu Xiejun and Tang Pinji of Pu Fenglai and Tang Apin Bookbinding Shops consulted with Zhang Haosheng, Director of the Union, and Zhang Jinming and Qiao Aken, representatives of the Union, and others in the Wanshang Tea House in Xinzha Bridge yesterday. The results were: (1) Wages for both Chinese and Western-style workers will be increased by 10% uniformly, effective June 1st. (2) The number of apprentices in each Chinese-style workshop will remain the same, limited to five people. (3) The daily meal subsidy for Chinese-style workers will remain the same, at eight cents per worker. However, it must wait until both labor and management and all workers and all colleagues have contacted each other before formally signing the contract at 10:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Union Notice: The Bookbinding Union issued Bulletin No. 11 yesterday, stating that the members are not satisfied with the modified treatment conditions, which has led to a labor dispute. Now, the director of the union and ten representatives of the workers have negotiated with the employers on the three items of wage increase, apprenticeship, and meals. The agreement is now more perfect than the previous proposal. It is hereby announced that all workers will resume work uniformly on the 7th of this month. As for the detailed situation, it will be announced after the reorganization is completed. Be sure to do this.</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Union: The Municipal Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Department jointly issued an announcement to suspend union activities and sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, stating that the current officials of the union are incompetent in leading the current illegal strike of bookbinding workers, and that reorganization is necessary to benefit the labor movement. In addition to jointly announcing with the Municipal Civil Training Association to temporarily suspend the union's activities, we hereby send a letter to the Bureau to ask for instructions to seal up the union's meeting place to facilitate reorganization.</p>

Chairman Sir Miles Macnaghten presided over the meeting. The Secretary-General, Acting General Manager, and new advisors Wu Jingxiong and He Dequi were present.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Jingxiong</p>
<p>Welcoming Mr. Wu and Mr. He: After the meeting began, the chairman first welcomed the new advisors Wu Jingxiong and He Dequi on behalf of the Board, saying that the Board's appointment of the two gentlemen to assist in municipal administration was a matter of great celebration. He read the speeches of the two gentlemen at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, with the aim of seeking the interests and welfare of the citizens and promoting Chinese-foreign cooperation, which was admirable.</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple Temple Fair: Subsequently, the chairman signed and approved the minutes of the previous meeting and then said that the Jing'an Temple Temple Fair had good order during the Bathing Buddha Festival and no accidents occurred. The General Patrol will submit a report within a few days stating opinions on whether it is necessary to limit the number of stalls in the future.</p>
<p>Assessment Rent Appeal Committee Recommendation: Next, the record of the two meetings of the Assessment Rent Appeal Committee from the 19th to the 29th of last month was submitted, Mr. He Dequi</p>
<p>Recognized that most members had suggestions on the various claims and a certain director suggested that for households whose actual rent was lower than the assessed rent, the patrol donation could be gradually increased instead of directly calculating according to the new assessed price. However, most directors did not agree, saying that it would weaken the position of the Municipal Council, damage the income of the city treasury, and be unfair to all taxpayers.</p>
<p>Board of Directors of Hong En Hospital: Subsequently, the recent minutes of the Quanshu Committee Meeting, the Education Committee Meeting, the Police Committee Meeting, and the Joint Meeting of the Police and Works Committee were approved. It was proposed that the superintendent of Hong En Hospital sent a letter to notify the board that Director Fei Xindun's term expires this year, but he is willing to run for election. It was unanimously decided to re-elect Fei as a director.</p>
<p>Rice Price Issue: The chairman then said that rice prices have been gradually rising recently. Can the Bureau take any measures to stabilize rice prices? The Chinese directors expressed the opinion that the time is not yet ripe.</p>
<p>Summer Vacation Dates: Finally, it was decided that the Board of Directors would take a vacation from July 30th to September 1st as usual. The sample of the Municipal Council Gazette to be published on Friday was passed and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Inspections of Five Industries Such as Paper Making Have Been Completed</p>
<p>Inspection of Extremely Precise Instruments Industry Started Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau has been conducting factory inspections since January of this year in preparation for the implementation of the Factory Law. The inspections of the paper-making, match, oil-pressing, silk mill, and cotton yarn industries have been completed. The inspection of the machinery and other industries began yesterday. It is estimated that most of them will be completed before the implementation of the Factory Law on August 1st. However, the Shenxin First and Second Factories of the cotton yarn industry refused to allow the bureau's personnel to inspect them. The director of the bureau, Pan Gongzhan, was reportedly very angry and specially instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Yarn Factory Association yesterday, saying that the bureau is conducting factory inspections and has notified all factories that should be inspected in advance. However, when personnel were sent to the Shenxin First Yarn Factory for inspection, the director of the factory, Zheng, refused, claiming that he had been instructed by the general manager of the factory and could not disobey, etc. The factory's general manager, Rong Zongjing, was ordered to correct it. Unexpectedly, when the personnel went to the Shenxin Second Factory for inspection the day before yesterday, the factory still refused in the same way. It is inappropriate to deliberately create difficulties and obstruct official duties. General Manager Rong Zongjing is again strictly ordered to correct it. It is hereby ordered that you comply with the order and instruct your subordinates to provide proper guidance when personnel from the bureau go to the factory for inspection in the future, and must not refuse.</p>

<p>The Reorganization Committee of the China Seamen's General Federation of Industry, located at No. 450 Qujiang Road in this city, was ordered to reorganize. On the 1st of this month, four Cantonese committee members of the association, including Zhao Zhizhi, and a secretary suddenly absconded, taking away all important documents. The Municipal Party Department sent personnel to take over the association the day before yesterday but failed. Three committee members of the association, including Miao Shuizhang, immediately telegraphed the Central Training Department on the same day for instructions.

Therefore, three committee members, including Qiu Yaokuan, Mu Aiyi, and Miao Shuizhang, took the night express train to the capital last night.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Air Express Mail <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Extremely Fast in Transfer and Delivery</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Authority stated that in order to make the public understand the convenience of air express mail, it will soon issue promotional materials. These promotional materials are specifically for those who purchase airmail stamps and those who send or receive regular airmail. Although regular airmail is relatively fast in transit, according to current regulations, it is delivered at the same time as regular mail. Therefore, if regular airmail arrives at the destination post office after the last delivery time for regular mail, it will inevitably be delayed until the next day for delivery. However, air express mail, even if it arrives at the destination after the last delivery time for regular mail, can be delivered immediately upon arrival. Therefore, for urgent letters, it is best to send them by air express mail, as both transfer and delivery are extremely fast.</p>

<p>Ministry of Finance Replies to Road Association</p>
<p>The Road City Exhibition Conference being prepared by the China National Road Construction Association has been scheduled to open on September 12th this year. The exhibits are divided into domestic and foreign categories. In addition to the domestic transportation of exhibits already approved for tax exemption by the Ministry of Finance, the foreign exhibits have now been telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance by the association for approval to handle inspection and release with a bond. The association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, which briefly stated that the notice of the 22nd and the telegram from President Wang Xun of the National Road Construction Association have been received. The tax deposit paid for the exhibits is a guarantee. If there is no tax deposit, once the goods are inspected and released, there is no way to recover the tax if they are not returned within the time limit. In order to protect tax revenue, the Ministry will still have to handle all exhibits transported by your association uniformly. However, the tax deposit does not necessarily require cash; a bond from a reliable bank can also be used. In addition to instructing the Jianghai Customs Supervisor to instruct the customs commissioner to inspect and release the exhibits transported to your association with a tax deposit and stipulate that they must be returned to their original location within one month after the closing. If they are not returned within the time limit, the tax deposit will not be refunded. If the deposit is a bank bond, the bank providing the bond should be responsible for paying the tax. If the goods returned are less than the goods imported, the tax payable on the missing goods should be deducted from the deposit or paid in full by the bank providing the bond before the original bond can be returned. This special reply is for your information. Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Jiang Yin, discussed and removed the telegram reply to thank and sent telegrams to road city agencies, friendly businesses and commerce groups both domestically and abroad to follow the compliance.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Commodity Inspection Bureau Assists in Inspecting and Transporting Silkworm Eggs on Two Roads <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>From the 5th to the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>Autumn Silkworm Eggs Will Be Exempted from Detention After Identification</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau stated that the summer and autumn silkworm eggs produced by domestic silkworm egg manufacturers are now being transported frequently. They should be detained and released separately. The bureau sent personnel to assist in the inspection at major stations in the silkworm egg areas of the Jinghu and Hangyong railways to facilitate the process. The bureau sent a letter to the management bureaus of the two railways yesterday, requesting them to investigate. The original letter stated: In order to ensure strict inspection and prevent inferior varieties from entering the market, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has requested the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways to instruct the Jianghai Customs and various stations to cooperate in the inspection. However, it has been found that there are many silkworm egg manufacturers in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the summer and autumn silkworm eggs they produce are transported frequently by land and water. The summer silkworm eggs are already in the sales season and should be detained if they have not been inspected, qualified, and labeled. The autumn silkworm eggs are often transported to cold storage in other cities because the manufacturers do not have cold storage facilities. These silkworm eggs have not been soaked in acid and have not yet reached the reporting period, so they have not been labeled. However, it has been found that autumn silkworm eggs must be sent to cold storage within 24 hours after laying, otherwise the quality will be affected and the loss will be great. It is feared that the inspectors at various stations will detain them all without distinguishing between them, causing danger. However, it is not easy for non-silkworm experts to distinguish between summer and autumn eggs. In order to facilitate inspection, the bureau will assign one or two technicians to assist in the inspection at various stations in the silkworm egg areas of Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Hangzhou from the 5th to the 15th of this month to facilitate the process. After the deadline, the silkworm eggs that have not been labeled will still be detained according to the previous regulations. In addition to sending letters to various stations, this letter is sent to your bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Chinese People's Love of Peace</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating: On the afternoon of May 27, the merchant ship Atlan City, managed by the American Steel Company, was docked at the Qichangzhan Pier in Pudong, this city. A cook named A. Tanarelis Tiff (transliteration) disembarked from the pier and, being heavily intoxicated, staggered into the town's main street, running wildly. At that time, many pier workers were leaving a restaurant after eating. The cook ran into them, brandishing a small fruit knife as if to stab them. Yang Jin'er, Wang Jinfa, Ma Lin, and others were unable to avoid him. Yang's right thigh was stabbed, Ma's left cheek was slightly scratched, and Wang's right eye was punched. The Third District Police Station was reported and immediately dispatched a senior police officer to the scene to stop the cook, who fled back to the ship. The ship's captain used a rope to tie him up and expressed his responsibility to punish the cook. Chief Patrolman Shen returned to the station and reported the incident by telephone to the Third District, which was forwarded to this bureau by District Chief Zhang. After investigation, on the morning of the 29th, the ship's captain sent a letter of apology to the Third District, stating that he was deeply grateful that the senior police officer had arrived at the scene and made every effort to maintain order, avoiding other unexpected accidents. He also expressed his deep apologies and was willing to compensate the injured for medical expenses of 20 yuan and be punished in accordance with the Law on Violations of Public Security. Subsequently, the injured parties stated in the district that their injuries were extremely minor and that they did not wish to file a lawsuit, and a settlement was filed. The Third District fined the cook 10 yuan. Chen Zhiliang, the secretary of the papermaking workers' union, who did not know the truth, distributed printed flyers. The bureau summoned Chen and the injured parties, Yang Jin'er and Ma Lin, to the bureau for questioning. Their statements were consistent with what they had said in the district. The bureau distributed the medical expenses paid by the cook, with Yang Jin'er receiving 14 yuan and Wang Jinfa and Ma Lin receiving 3 yuan each. A statement was drawn up and the case was closed. Chen Zhiliang also realized that the flyers he had issued were not consistent with the facts and that there had been a misunderstanding. He was very sorry. The bureau did not pursue the matter further as he had admitted his mistake. This case involves an American merchant ship's cook who, while drunk, assaulted passersby. The reports in various newspapers were mostly mistaken by reporters, which were exaggerated and misleading. This special letter is sent to clarify the facts.</p>

He first telegraphed the relief funds to Xi'an, ordering Cui Xianlou, Pin Qing, Dai Zhenshan, Li Yunmen, Lu Xiaoyu, and other gentlemen in Shaanxi to select the counties most severely affected by the disaster for investigation and distribution. He also requested Shang Yunting, Tang Mufen, and Yin Guangzi, who were experienced in disaster relief, to proceed from Ping to Shaanxi to supervise the process, so as not to delay the relief. He himself would personally escort the relief goods from Ping by way of the Pinghan Railway, transferring to Zhengzhou and then to Xi'an. Yesterday, two telegrams were received from Zhu, stating that he had arrived safely in Shaanxi province on the 4th.

I have received your telegram, and I am very grateful that you have traveled far in the summer to save the people from the flood. I am also grateful that you have shown that the urgent relief has been released. The people of the same mind believe that the counties in Shaanxi that have been severely affected by the disaster should be given appropriate urgent relief to help them survive. Relief work and rehabilitation work are secondary. Only benevolent ones can see that the disaster in Gansu needs to be rescued urgently.

<p>Director Zhang of the Fourth District Has Returned to Song</p>
<p>The Supervisory Officer of the District Department, Hou, to Be Replaced by Hu</p>
<p>Zhang Han, director of the Fourth District of the Wusong Maritime Public Security Team, was previously ordered by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to jointly crack down on maritime bandits with the National Coast Guard, the Jiangbei Pacification Army, and the land police of Tong, Ru, Hai, and Qi counties. He was also appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression and allocated 20,000 yuan in funds. After receiving the order, Director Zhang immediately went to Nantong to establish a temporary office for bandit suppression and fishing protection, commanding the naval and land police and warships to search and suppress bandits in the waters of Lusi, Da'an Port, Pingcha, Fengli, and Juegang. It has been learned that all the maritime bandits entrenched in the waters have been gradually suppressed, and 50 men and women who were kidnapped by the bandits have been rescued. Director Zhang concluded the bandit suppression work, so he closed the temporary office for bandit suppression and fishing protection on the 31st of last month and led the water police team back to the Wusong District Department yesterday. He has reported the bandit suppression and fishing protection and the closure of the office to the Provincial Government for record.

<h3 id="e185">Lu Zhongen and Lu Dongsheng Sever Their Adoptive Father-Son Relationship <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Allowance of 800 Dollars</p>
<p>No Longer Father and Son</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen was originally the illegitimate son of Lu Zizhuang and Hua Shen, when Zizhuang was a pastor in Songjiang. When he was nine years old, Zizhuang handed him over to his younger brother, Dongsheng, to be raised as an adopted son. Later, Hua Shen requested that Lu Zhongen provide some support, but he refused, leading to a lawsuit. Dongsheng also sued the Special Zone Court for severing the adoptive relationship, citing Zhongen's violent temperament and other reasons. The preliminary judgment rejected his claim. The original claim and the main points are summarized as follows: The plaintiff adopted Hua Zhongen as his adopted son in 1916, when he was only nine years old. He raised, educated, and found him a job, and he married this year. However, the defendant did not follow the teachings, kicked his adoptive mother, beat his niece, and denied his biological mother's request for support in court, which shows that his nature has been destroyed and he has no conscience. Therefore, he requests to sever the relationship. The defendant responded that the plaintiff is his adoptive father and his biological father, Lu Zizhuang, is his biological father. When he was a pastor in Songjiang, he had a relationship with the defendant's biological mother, Hua Shen, and had the defendant. He was adopted by the plaintiff. His original wife, Zhao, loved the defendant more than her own son, and the defendant also regarded her as his own parents. Zhao even cut her flesh to cure her relatives when she was ill. However, after Zhao's death, the scene changed greatly when his stepmother, Wang, came to the house, and his adoptive father also changed slightly. Now, he falsely accuses the defendant of being a child of a different surname and requests to sever the adoptive relationship. He has already filed another lawsuit to confirm his identity. The reasons for the judgment are summarized as follows: The plaintiff's claim that the defendant is usually violent cannot be supported by evidence. As for the claim that he does not recognize his biological mother, which shows that his nature has been destroyed, the defendant claimed that he did not not recognize her, but that he did not know her. The defendant has been raised by the plaintiff since he was a child and has not heard from his biological mother for a long time. It is true that he does not know who his mother is, and it is difficult to say that this is a complete lack of conscience. It is difficult to justify the request to sever the relationship with an adopted son who has been raised for more than ten years. Later, Lu Dongsheng refused to accept the original judgment and hired lawyer Wen Chao to appeal to the Higher Second Branch Court. Yesterday was the opening date for the trial. Judge Hu Yigu presided over the trial. He first said that Lu Zhizhuang was ill and did not come today, and the witnesses were not all present. However, the case should be settled amicably. He then told Lu Dongsheng that when you adopted this child, he was only nine years old. Raising him until now must have cost you a lot of effort and money. Moreover, you married him off last year, which shows that your original purpose was to have him support you in your old age and live peacefully. Now, unfortunately, you have disagreements and request to sever the relationship. His productive capacity is still weak. He only earns 25 yuan a month in the Engineering Bureau. It is difficult to support a family under such circumstances. It is better to give him some money according to my suggestion and order him to live separately. If your son can change his temperament due to the external environment and think that there is still room for reconciliation, then the father and son can reunite. If he still does not change his temperament, then they will be separated permanently and will no longer interact with each other. Moreover, you have already spent a lot of money on his education and marriage. This is the last time you will be kind to him. People are not grass and trees, and they will always be grateful and repay you one day. At first, Lu Dongsheng only agreed to give 100 yuan. Later, after the judge repeatedly persuaded him, he agreed to give 600 yuan. Lu Zhongen claimed that his income was not high, which made it difficult for him to live. If he could give him 1,000 yuan and deposit it in the bank, he would only take the interest and not move the principal to subsidize his household expenses. Moreover, he had no ill feelings towards his adoptive father. If his productive capacity increased in the future, he would not only not want the allowance, but he would also be willing to learn from the filial crows to give back. The judge then summoned Lu Wang and told him that you can persuade your husband to give a little more allowance to settle this matter. After several parties, including the lawyer, discussed it, Lu Dongsheng was ordered to pay 800 yuan in foreign currency in three months. After Zhongen received the money, he moved out the belongings and was not allowed to pester his adoptive father. It is hoped that the father will change his mind and the son will reform himself in order to reunite in the future. The case was thus concluded.</p>

<h3 id="e187">The Luoyang Maru Collides With the Pier <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Five Tugboats Forced to Drag Her Out</p>
<p>Two Tugboats Collide With Each Other and Are Damaged</p>
<p>The Luoyang Maru, a Yangtze River ship of the Nissin Shipping Company, was docked for repairs this time, and the work was completed yesterday afternoon. The company sent a small steamship, the Anshan Maru, to Pudong to tow the Luoyang Maru to the Nissin Pier in Hongkou to load goods for Hankou. At about 2:00 PM, when the Luoyang Maru arrived at the Waibaidu Bridge, it was hit by the tide, and the ship's left side violently collided with the wooden pier outside the pier. The ship was immediately stuck and could not move. The small Anshan Maru went forward to tow it, but it was ineffective.</p>
<p>Four Tugboats Were Called for Rescue</p>
<p>The Anshan Maru was unable to tow the ship and urgently reported to the Nissin General Office. The Kunshan Maru and Jidao Maru tugboats were dispatched to help. At about 2:30 PM, the two tugboats towed together, but it was useless. The ship reported to the General Office again, and the company dispatched its number one powerful tugboats, the Bai Maru and Shan Maru, to continue to assist in the rescue. At that time, it was about 3:00 PM, and the four tugboats towed together, but it was still useless.</p>
<p>The Small Ships Collided and Damaged</p>
<p>The Bai Maru and Shan Maru tugboats were unable to tow the ship, so they changed their strategy. The Bai Maru joined a steel cable to try to drag the Luoyang Maru horizontally, and two tugboats were dispatched to escort it from behind, which would be easier. Unexpectedly, when the Bai Maru turned its ship, its bow and the bow of the Shan Maru were in a straight line and could not avoid each other. The two tugboats collided with each other, and the hulls of the Bai Maru and Shan Maru were damaged, and the iron poles on the ships were also damaged, resulting in huge losses. The pier was damaged. At about 4:00 PM, the Luoyang Maru was finally pulled out by the full force of the four small ships. The wooden pier outside the pier was damaged by the hull of the Luoyang Maru. The steel plate of the Luoyang Maru's own hull was not severely damaged, but the damage to the pier was quite large. After the Luoyang Maru was pulled out, it immediately loaded goods and left. The damaged small ship pier needs to be repaired today.</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau Prevents the Harm of Mad Dogs</p>
<p>In order to prevent the harm of mad dogs and protect the safety of citizens, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has formulated measures to ban stray dogs and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval.

Dog owners in the rural areas of the city should apply for registration at the health offices in their respective districts and pay a fee of 25 cents per dog. Dog owners who delay or violate the regulations will be punished. Subsequently, a new license should be renewed once every January. The bureau issued a notice yesterday stating that all dog owners must report their dogs in order to avoid stray dogs and domestic dogs being mistaken. Many dog owners in the city have already registered, but many have not yet obtained a license.</p>

<p>In the Shooting Range Barracks</p>
<p>And There Will Be Tactical Performances</p>
<p>The Chinese Team of the International Business Corps was founded in the late Qing Dynasty by gentlemen such as Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Hengzhi in Shanghai. It has been 25 years since its establishment. The founders of the team believe that the Chinese team has been serving the public diligently and has always been recognized as being highly qualified. This has been achieved through the hard work of all comrades in the past 25 years. Such a performance is not only a testament to the spiritual interests of each member and the military as their home, but also a manifestation of the national spirit. It has been decided to hold the 25th anniversary celebration at the shooting range barracks at the end of North Sichuan Road on June 14 and to perform various tactical exercises to mark the celebration. On that day, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will also present the team with a team flag. Therefore, the team has issued invitation tickets in addition to the preparations to invite people from all walks of life in China and the West to attend the ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Continuing Records of Contraband Seized by Customs <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs seized a large quantity of drugs, 392 pounds of heroin, from the Dutch ship "Kimi" of the Java Company, and also seized 179 pounds of heroin from the Japanese ship "Dou Beng Maru," as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Dutch ship "Kimi" came to Shanghai from Germany and the Netherlands, and customs officials were dispatched to search the ship because they had received a secret report in advance. The search of the Japanese ship took place at the Merchants' Wharf. Both batches of drugs were shipped from Germany. It was confirmed yesterday that when the large quantities of drugs carried by the two ships this time were shipped out of Europe, no one except the parties involved knew about the procedures, which were very secret. It is not known whether the ship's employees and owners were aware of this, otherwise, such valuable items would not have been transported without incident. Furthermore, since there was no consignee, it is still unknown who purchased and transported the goods. After the Dutch ship had its cargo confiscated, the shipping bureau and the ship are not responsible. Therefore, the ship has already sailed. However, after detailed investigation, it was found that some of the drugs on the Dutch ship may have been transshipped to Vladivostok via Shanghai, and some of the drugs on the Japanese ship may have been transshipped to North China and Dalian. Now that they have all been confiscated, the shipping bureau is still thoroughly investigating the shipping company in order to identify the person who privately loaded the goods, so as to know the location of the principal and the name of the company.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Western Police Unprovoked Abuse of Chinese <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Municipal Council, Warning</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday regarding the case of Western police officers abusing Chinese people without provocation. The letter stated: "Respectfully, according to a letter from Mr. Yuan Yiqing, on the evening of May 30th, when the singer Hong Mudan performed at the Broadway Theater in Tilanqiao, the iron gates were tightly closed in advance. The audience waited at the corner of the road until nearly 8:45 pm when a small hole was opened, allowing only one person to enter in a stooped position. The theater also hired Western police officer No. 140 and two Chinese police officers as if facing a formidable enemy. At that time, a fellow Chinese citizen, for some unknown reason, angered the Western police officer and was brutally beaten. Not only was he beaten, but he was also taken to the police station. Many fellow citizens witnessed this and were outraged, demanding refunds for their tickets. The duty of the police is to maintain order. If there is no disturbance of the peace, how can they arbitrarily detain people? At that time, I personally witnessed that the person in question did not resist and was a law-abiding citizen. Therefore, the actions of the Western police officer were illegal. The honor and disgrace of one person is a small matter, but the entire personality of us Chinese is a big matter. Moreover, it is the sixth anniversary of the May 30th Incident, and foreigners have no regard for insulting us as before. If the crowd had resisted due to temporary anger, wouldn't the tragedy of the May 30th Incident be reenacted at that time? Therefore, we request your council to seriously negotiate with the Municipal Council in accordance with the law to prevent such unfortunate incidents from recurring in the future." The association believes that Western police officers often abuse their authority and insult residents, which is likely to cause unfortunate incidents. According to the aforementioned letter, we request your council to pay special attention to this matter and investigate the Western police officer concerned.</p>

<p>Due to Not Being Repaired for More Than Ten Years</p>
<p>The houses in Pinjili, Wengjia Branch Lane, Jinjiafang, West Gate of this port, were rebuilt in the seventh year of the Republic of China. At that time, the construction cost was extremely cheap. The construction was handled by a Mr. Pan, and the structure of the house was quite strong. The structure of the sun deck was very simple. The handrail of the sun deck was made of foreign pine planks, which were installed next to the sun deck. They were exposed to the sun and rain, and were invaded day and night. In addition, they had not been repaired for many years, resulting in the wooden stairs being moldy and unusable. Unexpectedly, at about 6 pm yesterday, a woman from the Teng family at No. 15 in the lane went to the sun deck to collect clothes. When she stepped on the handrail, it suddenly collapsed, and the woman fell with the stairs, injuring her head and arms. She was covered in blood and fainted instantly, losing consciousness. After waking up, her senses were abnormal. Her internal injuries were also quite serious. It is said that the injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment. According to the tenants, the landlord has not repaired the house even once in more than ten years, causing this disaster.</p>

<p>Wu Suying, a 19-year-old woman from Huzhou, lost her father at a young age and was raised by her mother. However, the family's finances declined and life was difficult. Unfortunately, in August of last year, according to the old calendar, she was brought to Shanghai by her mother. Through the introduction of a friend from her hometown, she became a prostitute at the Yihong Ya'er brothel at the Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession to earn a living. Fu Yiming, a clerk from a Yuxiaozhen hotel on Yangxing Street, happened to be the same age as Wu. After they got to know each other, their feelings grew day by day. After a long time, they secretly made a lifelong commitment. Unexpectedly, this matter was discovered by her mother, who interfered and sabotaged it again and again. The two had no choice but to agree to wait for an opportunity. Until a week ago, her mother suddenly returned to her hometown due to an incident. The two took this opportunity to elope and temporarily hid in Room 7 of the Central Hotel in Xiaodongmen. After nearly ten days, Suying recently heard that her mother would return to Shanghai in a day or two. Knowing that she would not have a good outcome at that time, she deeply regretted everything she had done rashly. After repeated consideration, she was filled with worry and indignation. At about 4 pm yesterday, while Fu was out, she secretly bought a large amount of opium and swallowed it. Fortunately, the tea room attendant caught a glimpse of it and immediately reported the situation to the Yi Section Chief of the Second Branch of the First District. After hearing the report, the section chief immediately sent a patrol officer to rush to the scene and send Wu to Shanghai Hospital for treatment in a car. It is reported that the toxicity has not yet erupted and her life can be saved.</p>

However, the eldest son of the eldest son, Jinshou, was not listed.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Appeal for Disaster Relief in Rehe <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society recently received a joint telegram from Zhou Tiezheng, the magistrate of Chaoyang County, Rehe, the heads of various bureaus of the county government, Meng Fubin, the president of the Chaoyang Red Cross Society branch, and the leaders of organizations, stating: "The mountains in the third district of Chaoyang are rugged, the people are poor, and the land is barren. If the rain falls in time, the harvested grain is only enough to make a living. If disasters occur frequently, the villagers have no way to survive. This is the actual situation in this area, which should be known to those who have lived in this land. Last year, continuous rain caused a disaster. The river water rose and flooded the fertile fields at the foot of the mountains. Some were completely washed away, turning good fields into riverbeds. Some were flooded and became barren, turning fertile land into sand. As a result, those who were well-off in the morning became destitute in the evening. As for the fields in the mountains, the rainwater has been continuous, and the soil has become even more barren, with very little harvest. Since the beginning of winter last year, the money supply has been extremely tight and the price of grain has been low. Knowing that there is a shortage of food, they still have to sell it to repay debts. It is like cutting the flesh from the heart to treat the current wound. It is indeed unavoidable. This spring, borrowing money is impossible. How can there be a way to turn stone into gold? As a result, those who carry their children and daughters and flee for their lives are everywhere, and nine out of ten households are starving. The buds of trees and wild vegetables have been completely dug up. The suffering of displacement is indescribable. Representatives cannot bear to sit idly by and are unable to lend a hand. They can only sigh and lament. We have always admired the great philanthropists who are concerned about the suffering of the people and have the spirit of universal relief and the ability to do everything. They will rescue those in need, regardless of distance or relationship. They are moved by the sight of misery and touched by the sound of disaster. We beg you to extend your grace and save the people in the entire area. We beg you to have great compassion and revive the dying fish in the drying rut. Not only will the disaster victims in the entire area be grateful for your rebirth, but the representatives will also never forget your mercy. We are eagerly looking forward to your reply."</p>

The factory not only refused but also automatically shut down the factory as a threat, causing the livelihood of thousands of workers to be cut off. Workers must not strike without authorization, and factories must not shut down without authorization. The Chinese government has repeatedly emphasized this. Although they are foreign capitalists, they should absolutely abide by it. Moreover, the payment of wages for holidays on revolutionary memorial days has long been clearly stipulated. How can they violate it? Our association shares the joys and sorrows of the factory workers. Upon hearing the news, we are filled with grief and indignation. We uphold the principle of mutual assistance and pledge to face any difficulty with unwavering resolve. We hope that the factory workers will be unyielding and fight to the end for the May 5th Revolution, even if it means death with honor. We will use justice to resist power and surely prevail. We also hope that the municipal government authorities will strictly abide by the late Premier's teachings on protecting the interests of laborers and strive to maintain them, leading the masses forward. The future of the labor movement depends on it. This declaration is hereby made.</p>

<p>Your newspaper's 30th issue carried a news item titled "Xiong Yimin's Body Divided into Two Sections." It stated that Xiong (Yimin) went to the Law School in the morning to meet his cousin and did not return to his residence until after 11:00 PM. He was unexpectedly run over and killed by the last train coming from the North Station while crossing the tracks. This is inconsistent with the facts. According to my uncle, Yimin left the Law School on the morning of the 28th to handle important matters. At around 10:00 PM, patrol officers of the Songhu Railway Police discovered a male corpse in front of the Law School that had been run over into two sections by a train. Upon hearing the news, students from the Law School rushed to the scene. My uncle, Qingyun, recognized the body as that of my uncle, Yimin. The exact time he was run over by the train is still unknown. This is a correction. I hope you will publish it. Xiong Qingquan, Nanjing.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing in response to a news item in your newspaper's local news section on June 5th regarding a lawsuit against the manager and partners of the Huizhong Bank. I am very surprised. I am writing to provide your newspaper with the true facts and request a correction. The manager of the Sanyou Tobacco Factory at 218 Yalu Road, Fan Songling, used the entire machinery of the factory as collateral to borrow money from our company, with the Qianyuan Tobacco Factory and the Liangzhou Tobacco Factory as guarantors. When the loan was being negotiated, the Sanyou Tobacco Factory had already been seized and sealed by the court due to debts. The borrowed money was used to redeem and unseal the factory. Shortly after, the guarantors came to our company and reported that the Sanyou Tobacco Factory had recently accumulated heavy debts and would inevitably repeat its previous mistake. Based on this information, our company reviewed its accounts and discovered that the debts were overdue and unpaid. We immediately sent a letter to the factory urging them to repay the debts as soon as possible within five days. Unexpectedly, they ignored it. On the afternoon of May 18th, we sent two foreign staff members to demand payment. Who knew that the factory would falsely claim to be closed and refuse entry? The foreign staff members returned and reported this. We then sent two coppersmiths familiar with machinery to inspect the machines. After they left, Fan Songling immediately ordered the doors to be closed and launched an attack on our staff, causing them to suffer humiliation and return injured. We reported this to the Hongkou Police Station at the time. The police station sent detectives to investigate, and the injured were sent to the Red Cross Hospital with injury certificates. In addition to formally filing a lawsuit in court requesting a fair trial, we are requesting a prompt correction to clarify the matter and dispel confusion. I eagerly await this. Sincerely, Huizhong Bank, June 5th, Special Delivery, To the Editor-in-Chief of Shenbao.</p>

<p>(Continued) Huang Fu</p>
<p>Speech at the Labor University</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the meaning that the universe gives to life is labor. Therefore, labor can be called humanity's vocation. Then, if everyone fulfills their respective labor responsibilities to complete their vocation, how can there be a distinction between labor classes in society? Not only did ancient China have the principle of equality among the four classes (scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants), but Guanzi also stated that the four classes are the foundation of the state, and the state cannot stand without any one of them. Even in European and American history, there was no record of a labor problem until a century and a half ago. The reason why the labor problem is so prevalent today is due to the Industrial Revolution in the distant past and the European War in the recent past. Since the Industrial Revolution, the production mechanism has expanded, and the quantity of production has increased dramatically. At the same time, in order to improve and refine, various countries have encouraged various inventions and stipulated various patent rights in law. As a result, the gap between the rich and the poor in society has widened. By the time the European War ended and the peace conference began, there was a proposal for an International Labor Organization among various countries. At that time, we thought that the Paris Peace Conference was a meeting for the Allied powers to negotiate peace with Germany. Discussions on reparations, territorial concessions, arms limitations, and war responsibilities were all appropriate topics. However, labor protection regulations were a matter of internal affairs and had no connection to the war against Germany. Why should it be proposed at the peace conference and included in the peace treaty? Only after careful investigation did we realize that there was a deeper meaning behind this. After the war ended, the armies that had expanded excessively during the war would inevitably be demobilized. The military supply factories and other war-related businesses that were busiest during the war also declined sharply. For a time, there was an oversupply of labor, and there was no way to find employment for them. The original positions in ordinary industries before the war were mostly occupied by female workers, and their performance was good, so it was impossible to deprive them of their livelihoods. Therefore, in the name of protecting labor, they advocated reducing working hours. For example, those who previously adopted a twelve-hour system now switched to an eight-hour system, which reduced their productivity by one-third. If a certain factory maintained its original production volume, it would inevitably have to hire one-third more workers according to its original total number of employees. This would not only allow the country to accommodate a large portion of the surplus labor, but also, in theory, while reducing working hours, wages should naturally be reduced proportionally. However, during the war, prices soared, and the cost of living increased significantly. It was difficult to maintain the old wages, let alone reduce them. They even had to discuss increasing them. At the same time, the Russian regime was controlled by the Communist Party, and the voice of preferential treatment for workers was rising high (in fact, in present-day Russia, in order to complete the five-year industrial plan, they are working tirelessly day and night under compulsion, and there is no preferential treatment to speak of). A slight mishandling of the situation would lead to extremism. Therefore, there were also proposals to improve factory treatment and increase wages. This is another meaning. Although reducing working hours, improving factory treatment, and increasing wages all reduce productivity and increase production costs, they are extremely unfavorable to international commercial warfare policies after the war. For example, if there are two factories, A and B, with the same nature, scale, organization, and number of employees, the factory in country A works twelve hours a day, and the daily wage per person is four yuan. The factory in country B works eight hours a day, and the wage is eight yuan. Moreover, factory A does not need to have facilities such as bathrooms, cafeterias, and entertainment venues to fix part of its capital, while factory B does. In this case, if the goods produced by the two factories are equally exquisite, the production cost of factory B will inevitably be several times higher than that of factory A. How can they cope with the commercial warfare that follows? Therefore, the European and American labor problem has transformed into an international labor problem. They must ensure that all countries in the world, regardless of wages, time, and treatment, are unified under a single agreement and follow the same path. This way, in theory, the productivity per person per day will be equal, and the production cost per factory per product will also be equal. Only then, in the commercial warfare arena, will those with strong capital, deep experience, abundant raw materials, excellent worker productivity, and complete financial transportation institutions win, or else they will lose. This is the inevitable trend. This is the fundamental meaning of the establishment of the International Labor Organization by European and American powers. We should see through the inside story and examine how our country's capital is (Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that there is no such thing as wealth in our country, only great poverty and small poverty. Alas, this is a painful statement). How is our experience and raw materials? How is the productivity of our workers and our financial transportation institutions? Alas, we can know what to strive for.</p>

<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Miracles of Nature</p>
<p>Now everyone, imagine on a remote island in the Indian Ocean, amidst the jungle on a white sand beach, there is a snow-white seabird spreading its wings to protect its chicks from the scorching sun. The one treating it well is a so-called white man, covered in wounds and stained yellow by ammunition. He is half-crazed with thirst. This person only needs to lift a hand to get forty pounds of fresh meat, but I cannot do that because her eyes are fixed on me, revealing a firm look. I have forgotten the surrounding environment, only feeling the strangeness of life.</p>
<p>Later, I searched in the woods and encountered a group of seagulls that had grown up but had not yet grown feathers. They were next to a tributary. When I walked past them, they called out to me for food. This really stunned me. I picked up the biggest one, wanting to tear off his head, but I couldn't do it. His head and neck twisted like a rubber band and sprang back repeatedly. Later, I bit off his head and sucked his blood. The taste was terrible.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I admired Robinson Crusoe, but the current environment is beyond my expectations. For example, I have never read in a book that there are thousands of small insects on the white sand beach ready to suck human blood. At night, when our energy is restored, everyone goes to the Schnee warship, otherwise, they will become victims of small insects or man-eating birds. As for whether we can invite mercy, it is still unknown. Therefore, twelve of us boarded an old and unsuitable for navigation lifeboat and sailed into the raging sea. But we tried our best to move the boat forward, but we were pushed back by the big waves. The heavy boat was very difficult to move.</p>
<p>After two hours, everyone was exhausted. Of the twelve people on the boat, only three were left. The other nine were knocked to the bottom of the boat by the huge waves. The remaining people tried hard to row the boat towards the bay, where the waves were as high as mountains and hit our necks. Apart from exerting our last strength, we prayed to heaven. When we set off, there were eight oars on the boat. Now, except for just one, they have all been washed into the sea. We had to rely on this one oar to slowly and unstably row forward desperately. Apart from pushing the land backward, I have never been more joyful.</p>
<p>Escaping Death</p>
<p>Suddenly the lifeboat leaked and immediately flooded. Before the boat was smashed to pieces, we tried our best to row towards the distant Schnee. Two people bailed out the water in the boat, and the third person rowed desperately to get closer to the big ship. At first, we could not see the ladder of the Schnee, even though it was lit with lights. In the moonlight, we often saw groups of sharks circling our small boat. The boat often made creaking noises, indicating that it could no longer withstand the impact of the huge waves.</p>
<p>Finally, our small boat approached the ladder of the Schnee. Because it was my turn to row at this time, I was the last person to step onto the solid ladder. When one foot was on the ladder, I felt the small boat sink downwards. When the other foot was raised, only a few pieces of broken wood were floating on the water, and many disappointed sharks were also startled on the water.</p>
<p>The officers on the Schnee warship shone the lights on us and immediately searched us. This was really an easy task because our clothes were long gone. What I can't forget the most is the cup of tea they gave us, the taste of which was indescribably good.</p>
<p>Later, we were transferred to a French cruiser and transported to Colombo. We squeezed in a small passage under the ladder. We had no clothes and no blankets and suffered the pain of prisoners of war. Several British soldiers on the ship sent food and blankets to us, but the French soldiers standing on the ladder strongly refused. There were three times when our friends pushed the French soldiers down the ladder and then sent the blankets and food to us, but in this way, they were not allowed to go up the ladder to see us.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this kind of treatment of prisoners of war is really unfair. If prisoners of war fell into our hands, the situation would be very different. In Penang, the Emden sank a French destroyer. Our captain, Molo, lowered the boat to rescue thirty-six French soldiers before the enemy's artillery fire was over. Although there was very little food and cigarettes on board, we still shared them with them. When we transported them to another ship, they all shouted thanks. They also said that they had heard people say that the Germans treated prisoners of war very cruelly.</p>
<p>We were transferred to the Helmsqua ship and sent to Malta. I would like to say that there are very few of us who survived from the Emden, only about fifty people. After the war, I met a few of them, but everyone's appearance was different from before. The Cocos Islands battle was really fatal.</p>
<p>Leisurely Journey</p>
<p>This is a historical event. The forty-nine people who were left on the island sailed an old Aijixia sailboat with a little food and fresh water towards the Arabian coast. When they arrived there, everyone went ashore and took a car through the desert to Damascus, but their clothes were tattered and their faces were haggard, and they were almost unable to express themselves. How could the scholars there believe this story? Their feat was really impossible.</p>
<p>There are two things that I will never forget: the soldiers on the Emden calling out three cheers for the captain while leaning on their guns before they died, and the scene of the French destroyer being sunk in Penang.</p>
<p>Speaking of the second thing, at that time I was in the ammunition lifting room. The position was very narrow, only four feet square. The two cranes in the room had already been blown up by artillery fire. The smell of burning rubber made me suffocated. The light in the room was originally only a candle. Since the oxygen supply was cut off, it also went out in a few minutes. Opening the armor door was against military orders when the battle started, so I lay in the room half-dead. Later, I heard a voice of temporary ceasefire from the intercommunication tube. I used all my strength to open the iron door and walked onto the deck to breathe life-saving air.</p>
<p>I forgot everything when I came back to life. The rising sun rose from the sea, and a golden half of the sun appeared in the darkness. Looking over, there was half of the stern of the enemy ship sticking out of the water. We could also hear the sound of the engine running. Four seconds later, the ship shook and rolled over, and in an instant, it sank to the bottom of the water. At this time, I couldn't help but reflect on philosophy, silently watching the sun created by God and sending off the man-made ship sinking. This incident was even more shocking than the scene of the Matlas oil tank exploding and the fire was blazing. (End)</p>
