<p>時評</p>
<h3>從今雙十節到明年雙十節</h3>
<p>丨一年的計劃丨</p>
<p>今日爲二十年度國慶紀念。内憂外患。交相煎逼山河破碎。民苦倒懸。吾人雖欲於今日勉舒愁眉。强顏苦笑。亦不可能。與其謂今日爲「國慶。」母甯謂爲「國難。」</p>
<p>民國肇造。忽忽二十年。每值「國慶。」國人無不致其熱望與希冀之忱於賡續展開之未來歲。月以「昨死今生」自譬解。并以鄭重自勵。然而二十年來。每况愈下。迄至今年。更臨空前之危難。悠悠歲月。漫漫長夜。國人再不覺醒。更待何日。更待何年。</p>
<p>吾人在今日哭笑不得。彼東隣强者。正揚掌歡欣。高唱勝利之曲。處於暴力蹂躪下之我東北同胞。在今日或且欲一懸國旗亦不可得。時危勢急。未來歲月。將更不堪設想。國人再不覺醒。更待何日。更待保年。　　今請臚列數事。爲今後一年努力之目標。自今年雙十節起。至明年雙十節。務以我全體國民之力量。促其實現。目前之國難重重。謂其爲我民族二十年來因循晏安之總結算也可。謂其爲我民族生存能力之試騐也可。謂其爲助我國家轉弱爲强之動力。亦無不可。吾人今請最後自矢。「昨日已於昨日死。今日誓從今日生。」光明在前。鞭婚在後。國人其認定目標。竭全力以共趨。（一）提高民權</p>
<p>「民權」高於一切在民主國中。人民爲國家之主人。民權爲天經地義不受任何限制。無權之民。即爲變形之奴隷。即失「民主國」之眞意義。眞正之革命政黨。必立基於廣大之民衆。爲民衆利益而奮門之黨。必扶植民權。以民權爲黨權。惟民權大。黨權乃亦大。近年來黨權超越民權。鎭壓民權。寖且形成爲黨權與民權之爭。結果民權小。黨權亦小。一國之中。竟無可以統制全國之中心權力。故民衆企望和平。而和平迄難實現。民衆要求抗强禦暴。而政府仍無抵抗。今後一年。全國人民及執政之黨。須一致認定民權高於一切。非提高民權。無以保民族厚民生。爲人民者。固應以自己之偉力。提高本身應享之「民權。」而爲民服務之黨。尤應扶值民權之伸張。以符天下爲公之正義。　　（二）建設廉潔政府</p>
<p>「建設廉潔政府。」「打倒貪官汚吏。」革命後。呼聲極高。然而徵諸事實。則仍多令人失望。捐税繁重。民窮而官不窮。舉其實例。如有鉅大之水利經費。而河治不修。有鉅大之建設經費。而建設甚微。民浸洪流。而無以救。外侮日亟而無以禦。夫豈偶然。岳武穆云。「文官不愛錢。武官不怕死。而天下太平矣。」不愛錢即廉潔。惟廉潔才不腐。惟不腐政治措施才能以民衆利益爲前提。才能有宏偉之效能。才能使我國家日趨於維新之道途。自今日起。我全體人民必以無上權力。監察政治。建立廉潔之政府。</p>
<p>（三）武裝民衆</p>
<p>惟眞正民衆之武力。乃能抗暴。乃能救國招募之軍隊。皆爲職業軍僱傭軍。以飢寒之驅使而來。以生命換衣食。毫無職責之認識。最易成爲個人之工具。故兵雖多。不僅不足以衛國。適足以亂國。今後一年。必實行武裝民衆。使民衆能有力自衛。外侮之來。能依有效之途徑爲國家效力。平時鍜鍊體魄。操習國術。以爲抗强禦暴之基本準備。至於現役軍人。尤須認清其天職爲保國。爲衛民。合乎保國衛民本旨之命令。絶對服從。否則决不遵守。新時代之軍人。應服從主義。認清職責决不作個人之工具。應抗禦外侮。决不參加内載。　　（四）勵行實業計劃</p>
<p>孫中山先生之全部實業計劃。爲破壞後之建設計劃亦即革命之主要目的。黨國統一而後。孫先生遺留之計劃。實行者有幾。遠者大姑勿論。即開濬運河。整治揚子江導淮等。亦毫無成績。以一○·七三五·四五四公方里之疆域。而全國鐵路僅一二·三三五公里。公路僅五一·二一○公里航綫僅一二·九八八公里有線電僅九一·一二○公里。電局僅一·一○五所。貨棄於野。不自取用寳藏於地。不自開發。生活必需。仰人而給。尤有甚者。以農業立國之國家。而土地荒蕪。農業凋敝。民皆離田。農產低落。衣食兩項。亦仰給輸入。建設如此。何能立國。目前世界經濟凋敝。論者謂世界經濟將復興自中國。換言之。即我不自起開發。列强將越爼代庖。使我國陷於經濟共管。甚至分割之慘境。故今後我政府我國民必本孫先生之計劃。切實勵行。努力以漸次實現。以增加國家之生產。并改善我國之經濟地位。而自今日起。一年之内。最低限度。尤應就今日所抵制之日貨。一一自起製造。以國貨作實際之替代。永遠之抵制。</p>
<p>（五）改進敎育</p>
<p>過去敎育之破產。效率之低落。蓋爲無可掩諱之事實。敎育之使命爲引導青年作新時代之創造者。絶非在於養成舊時代之繼承者。故學校之生活。應與社會生活相呼應。應打破讀死書。務須引導青年學得實騐生產·建設·改革·之能力。敎導其手腦並用。以手做。以腦追求「做」之所以然。同時更誘掖其精神思想。使其趨於創造之新途。青年爲我國家將來之柱石。亦即我民族未來生命之所繫。對於青年。絶不應懷疑畏懼。視爲不可親近。應多與青年接觸。與青年打成一片。處處與以扶掖。與以誘引。養成優美健全勇敢之國民。以担負未來時代之重任。自今日起。國人亟應致力於斯兩端。</p>
<p>（六）復興災區</p>
<p>今年水災。爲近六十年所罕見。五千萬人民盡溺洪流。十六省區全成滄海。損失之鉅。難以數計。現雖水潦漸退。而國家元氣。受傷極鉅。拯救災黎。招撫流亡。恢復元氣。亟有待於吾人之努力。目前我國家雖外患當前。亟應竭力抗禦。而於救災工作。仍絲毫不應放鬆。自今日起。我政府我國民。應分禦暴之力。力謀復興災區。及時下種俾野無茺土道無流亡。民皆復業。以恢復我國家氣。　　○　　○　　○</p>
<p>上述六項。皆爲今後立國之切實要圖。期於一年之中。務促其先後實現。今日爲陳死新生之界石。其甘於因循懈惰者。請遂從今日死去。否則請以新的思想新的體魄。新的勇敢前進之精神。接受並發揚今日之新生命。　　滾滾長江。浩浩滄海。四千年文明古國之未來歷史。前途正未可限量。暫時之陰霾。適爲增助我民族創造新歷史新時代之勇氣的鞭策。國人力吾望無窮。</p>

<h3>今後中國之兩大出路</h3>
<p>丨爲國慶紀念民日作丨（章淵若）</p>
<p>歲月如流。國事滄桑。寒暑往復。節又雙十。回想過去二十年之歲月。幾無時不在憂患之中。生靈塗炭。人心擾攘。河山破裂。邦國飄搖。我素富和平特性之王道民族。究不知何辜而遭此浩刼。演此慘劇。世界科學文化之怒潮。方於昇平歡樂之氣象中。如風馳電邁之前進。而我衰老悲苦之民族。猶於烽火連天之困境下。輾轉呻吟而無由自拔。每逢佳節。倍增感慨。撫今追昔。何來可慶之事實。何禁内心之憂傷。環顧世界局勢。瞻念來日大難。誠爲不寒而慄也。天下興亡。匹夫有責。作者曾不慚個人識見之淺陋。能力之薄弱。此心耿耿。無時不以民族之生命爲。重邦國之淪亡憂。深信吾人之生命。吾人之幸福。必須於整個民族之復興與發殿上。始勇寄托與增進。輒自靜研撥亂反正之道。長治久安之計。凡可利我邦國。福我社會。益我民衆者。莫不以最大之誠意。作涓滴之努力。今逢舉國同慶之日。而全民强笑之時。憂感紛來。不能自已。因草是篇。以寄所感。邦人君子。倘不以其人之微而廢其言。不以其言之拙而忽其意。伺時又不菲薄其個人努力對於社會民族之力量。勃然興起。以轉埀危之局勢。而開民族之生機。則吾於奮筆之時。所不勝厚望而視慶者也。</p>
<p>中山先生於彌留之時。奄奄斷續。作其最後之呼聲曰。「和平奮門···救中國」。當此恍惚彌離之時。其精神之所注。猶復集中於我危殆之民族。我悲苦之民衆。此最後一刹那間之呼聲。實含有無限熱烈沉痛之意義。我後死的信徒與同志。對此沉痛的遺敎。苟信仰未失。良心猶存。深夜靜思。當覺如何之悲痛。當思如何之奮勉。乃一觀今日之現象。以言和平。則羣方以權位相角逐。以地盤相厮殺。以意氣相門爭。以言奮門。則羣方以高堂汽車爲尊榮。以花天酒地爲樂園。以窮奢極慾爲風尙。無論在朝在野。在政在黨。在軍在仕。在商在學。舉不能否認此象之存在。生於憂患。而沉於安樂。國亡無日。慶於何有。人心厭亂久矣。吾民苦戰久矣。全國人民。無論爲土爲農爲工爲商。除少數掀風作浪。幸災樂禍者外。舉國上下。孰不喁喁望治。孰不殷殷圖强。顧何以此種普通遍的社會心理。始終抑鬱沉淪。不能發爲社會的力量。此則由於社會之先覺。不能因勢利導。告成磅礴雄厚之氣。而一般民衆。則又見於個人長吁嘆之無濟。因之妄自菲薄。浸淫而開爲萎靡頽唐之風。卒使道高一丈。魔高千丈。禍患之來。莫之奈何。此所以萬民苦戰。而戰總相尋。人心厭亂。而亂仍不已也。</p>
<p>今之言國是者。殆莫不認和平爲目前救國唯一之出路。故愚初歸祖國。即倡和平救國之論。大聲疾呼曰。「有和平則無事不可爲。無和平則萬事莫能救。」蓋在社會學的原則上。和平乃社會進化之基礎。當此革命的建設時期。倘欲與民更始。與民休養。與民生息。則其唯一而最初之條件。厥唯和平之基礎。有和平之基礎。始能靜求通盤建設之計劃。始能　　建設進行之障礙。始能穩保建設所　　　　唯和平始可恢復國家之元氣。　　　　能培養民族之生機。唯和平始能　　　民之生活。故和平者。建設之基礎　　　之起點。而吾民幸福之曙光也。</p>
<p>雖然。此老生常談。人且厭聞矣。吾人固日夜禱祝渴望和平之來也。顧何其實現之難乎。吾嘗言之。此實由於無堅强統一健全之民意。故無制裁擾害和平之實力。然此意猶未盡也。宇宙萬物。必有其則。「守一者治。守十者亂。」（語見商君）民國以前。天下定於一尊。萬民安於五常。鼎革以後。政失中心。羣無主宰。人治之木偶旣失。治治之精神未張。舊時之障礙雖除。而起代之新制未立。何者爲。新羣旣無差明之印象。尤無統一之見解。蚩蚩者氓。唯新是求。而新者卒渺不可得。空無所有。宜夫精神界大亂。是非莫辨。順逆不分。父無以敎子。兄無以詔弟。政無以惠民。民無以監政。青黃不接。轅轍背馳。鬱鬰倀倀之象。充塞天下。加以歐化東漸人欲横流。而吾國經濟狀况。猶復停頓於中古手業時代。未能緊隨横流之人慾。作比例的進展。尤以國人幼稚。未明物質文明之眞諦。在物質之昨用與經濟。非物質之享受與浪費。見異思遷。一唯西洋遊徒階級之怠風是尙。西洋金粉。已使人社會之風尙日趨於浮華。國人娱樂消耗之程度。恐已倍勝於巴黎紐約之士女。而其耐勞生產之能力。非但不及西人於萬一。抑且遠遜吾國之先祖。生產之能力驟减。而消費之慾望劇增。羣唯以奪取爲目的。不以服務爲天職。生於憂患。而君趨安樂。處於貧困。而羣尙奢華。卒致生矿不振。元氣大傷。供求不應。門爭愈烈。歐美普通工人所能享受之物質幸福。吾國上流社會之人尙日夜夢想而不可得。欲望之横流旣如彼。物質之貧乏又如此。價機一開。而舉國亂矣。</p>
<p>吾人於此。當根本覺悟。目前之中國。有兩大基本的需要。一於社會方面。須努力培植法治之基礎。一於物質方面。須努力於經濟之建設。（一）法治精神在平與直。百度旣準於法。萬事即歸於一。如是方可防治權之專横。始可保民權之發揚。而全體民衆。亦可得行爲之規範。共存之原則。於此所當申説者。吾所謂法治者。非云徒編訂白紙黑字之法典。而尤重在法律之擁護。法律之遵守。法律之實施。法非徒以制人。治者亦須受法之約束。舉凡一切僭竊弄權。倒行逆施之徒。尤須速予鏟除。關於此點。愚於他篇已論及之。今不多贅。（二）至於經濟之建設。尤屬目前刻不容緩之圖。現在之中國。尙有些微生矿之機存在乎。農荒於田。工怠於廠。商凋於市。土輟於學。固無論已。而全國生產停頓之結果。又造成全社部會之大貧困。飢饉連年。荒蕪滿目。人民且爭樹皮草根以苟延其殘喘。吾人於極度悲慘荒凉之困境。中唯有以最大之信心。最大之毅力。最大之勇氣。努力於民族經濟之發展。吾人苟有一分之精力與一分之智慧。首當用之於民族之生產。萬勿誤用於無謂之門爭。無謂之破壞。動心忍性。精誠無間。共負建設之大任。共謀建設之繁榮。建設工作。雖十分艱辛。尤以吾國福員之廣。問題之多。繼往開來。其任愈重。其道愈遠。然吾人祇須有愚公移山之精神。同舟共濟之心地。則建設一分。便是成功一分。倘若一日建之。十日毁之。一人作之。十人破之。雖欣欣向榮民富兵强之歐美。亦可焦頭爛額。無以圖存。則我本已千孔百瘡精疲力竭之民族。更將何堪此種打擊。而維持其殘命。至語救國安民。更南其轅而北其轍矣。世難平荒。民困國危。至於斯極。吾人生當憂患祇有一心一德。唯精唯誠。隨時隨地。共謀民族之建設。共圖民族之復興。努力各盡其能。鉅細均利於民。犧牲各本其誠。功成不必自居。要知民。族之痛苦即吾人之痛苦。民族之危亡。即吾人之危亡而民族之發展。即吾人之發展。民族之權利。即吾人之權利。民權之幸福。即吾人之幸福也。治亂安危。存亡興衰。悉繫吾人現在一念之覺悟。舉國沉沉。讀者倘不以吾言爲迂腐闊疏乎。念茲在茲請力行而證騐之。</p>

<p>林邱將有劇戰</p>
<p>昨日結果··</p>
<p>邱飛海直落三勝高惠民</p>
<p>江道章直落三勝楊綸章</p>
<p>丨雙打馬來佔勝勢丨</p>
<p>丨林望蘇小顯威風丨</p>
<p>全國網球名手集中羣英聚會之賑災網球賽、昨日下午三時半於中華網球場開幕、秋風厲害、危坐者頗不乏人單打初賽結果、邱飛海九比七、六比二、六比三、勝高惠民、江道章七比五、六比三六比四勝楊綸章、雙打第一週馬來佔天津優勢、今日單打複賽、林寳華於二時半起戰邱飛海、同時林望蘇戰江道章、奪决賽權、雙打繼續馬來天津未完之比賽、</p>
<p>中華網球六傑</p>
<p>（上）江道章高惠民邱飛海（下）林寳華林望蘇楊綸章（本館攝）</p>
<p>邱飛海克高惠民</p>
<p>九比七</p>
<p>邱飛海六比二高惠民</p>
<p>六比三</p>
<p>邱飛海堅忍克敵　邱高之戰、第一艦戰情最緊、共戰十六局才分勝負、雙方俱安危不定、高惠民鑒於邱之對角抽難於取勝、乃用時遠時近輕重不一之球對之、使不能常站底線抽擊一得機會即奔上攔殺邱飛海果爲之困、三三平手後、高忽四比三居前、於四四五五六六、及各七、勝負不分、邱處此境地、仍堅持不變、用力作對角抽、復用極準之左右邊線球壓去、以抵制其攔殺、高至此計窮力盡、十五局發球、竟二次雙錯误、第一盤遂以七比九失去第二第三盤高一落千丈不堪收拾矣、</p>
<p>高惠民擊法不差　少年英俊、高惠</p>
<p>民第一盤之戰、已顯其高妙之擊法雖敗不差其順反手、更其反手、穩健不失、足見訓練有工夫、發球亦有力、其奔跑之速、尤得力不少、對邱飛海之擊法、完全不差、一深遠之抽、加以奔上攔殺、及輕重遠不一之球、使不能作底線抽、是爲不二法門、惟邱固沙場老將、高不免經騐稍差也、</p>
<p>江道章勝楊綸章</p>
<p>七比五</p>
<p>江道章六比三楊綸章</p>
<p>六比四</p>
<p>江道章稱心如意　楊雖爲星洲名手、昨日戰江、竟以直落三失敗、除第一盤競爭稍烈外、二三兩盤全在江網拍之下、楊幾處守觀地位、第二盤三比三平手、江又得三局以六比三勝、第三盤江以五比一大勝、比六比四終、　　楊綸章非單打者　楊之單打、技藝稍差發球大把握、反手球尤多失誤、高球及抽擊、俱授人以殺球機會、惟觀其與林望蘇搭配雙打、則又不可同日語矣、</p>
<p>雙打馬來佔優勢</p>
<p>林望蘇四比六林寳華</p>
<p>（馬來）六比○（天津）</p>
<p>楊綸章一比一高惠民</p>
<p>馬來雙打搭配佳　雙打昨日未完畢、第一盤天津勝、第二盤馬來凈勝、第三盤馬來三比一佔先天黑今日續賽、第一盤馬來因楊之不起色、觸網及發球之雙錯誤、使天津連勝四局、五比一後、馬來雖奪回三局、仍以四比六失敗、第二盤楊綸章突然進步、林望蘇一得助手、天津則因高惠民之减色、錯誤甚多、馬來遂連勝六局、第三盤馬來聲勢仍盛、</p>
<p>林望蘇小施妙技　觀昨日雙昨日打、則林望蘇不特爲單打好手、亦雙打之能人高球極有把握、戰略尤毫無錯誤、其順手之一記穿縫抽、林之寳華對之亦無辦法球彈拍上不起、輔以楊綸章之殺網、大有勝天津之可能、</p>
<p>今日林邱有劇戰</p>
<p>今日林寶華邱飛海之複賽、爲渴望已久之戰、三年違别、究竟誰高、觀者須捷足、秩序如下、　　雙打</p>

<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>親愛的國人。我每逢國慶日。我總覺痛心。以前還　　可以强爲歡笑。跟在别人後面喊幾聲「雙十節萬歲。」「中華民國萬歲」應應故事。一　仍希望著國家一年好似一年。好使我們見了國人。臉上也有些光彩。到那纔覺得國慶眞的可慶了。誰知到了今年這年頭兒竟眼瞧著天災人禍邀約了内憂外患。一同降臨。弄得一箇偌大的中華民國。與那些已亡之國。差不多遠。唉。國慶國慶。你又來了。恕我們不能再把笑臉來歡迎你。惟有一副副憂國之涙。一顆傷時之心。是我們送與你的唯一的禮物。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>背起四個十字架</h3>
<p>十字架是猶太國的刑具，用横豎木頭各一根造成十字形，受刑　　的人兩手平展，釘在横木上，頭頸則釘在十字之上端。自從耶穌基督被釘死在十字架上之後，這十字架在西洋各國理成爲犧牲之符號。我們的雙十節是什麽意思？是兩個十字架！我中華國民要加倍犧牲纔能渡過這生死關頭。兩年前的雙十節我曾寫過一副對聯，上聯是「爲破壞犧牲，爲建設犧牲，中華國民應背兩個十字架」今天是民國二十年的十月十日，分明是要我們背起四個十字架了。我們在通常之破壞與建設外，還得爲水災犧牲，爲抗日犧牲！黃梨洲説：「慷慨從軍易；從容就義難。」我們從今天起該從從容容的把這四個十字架背起來吧！</p>
<h3>民國二十年雙十節感言</h3>
<p>— 張子廉</p>
<p>今日何日。我中華民國國慶紀念雙十　　節也夫此國慶紀念日。雖爲永久的。而非一時的然須我中華民國永遠存在。而後此紀念日乃能永留而不廢。故每當國慶紀念之雙十節凡我國人。莫不額手而相慶。特是所可慶者。亦僅僅乎紀念日耳。舍此即無足慶。蓋自民元迄今。所過之雙十節。至此而已二十度矣。然此二十年中。内戰不已外患方殷。固無可慶之事實而本年則兵禍之外。復加之以水災。國内眞有民不聊生之象。又奚足慶耶。近則更有强暴之日人。不惜違背公約。竟敢强佔我東省。是於雙十國慶之日。竟有喪失國土之恥矣。嗚呼。雙十也。喪失也。以滬人之口音。讀之本無甚異。然則今年之雙十國慶直可謂爲喪失國境矣雖然。人心未死。義勇猶存。日人縱暴。而我四萬萬民衆。果能一德一心。奮勇與抗。安見其不以倭奴三島之國。而爲我痛飮黃龍之地耶。因思滬人讀雙字固與喪字音同。而南人讀十與日亦屬同音。他日一戰。而果使日人喪亡。則今日之雙十節。亦未始不可預爲喪日之慶也。惟願吾全國之同胞。不忘喪失之恥。起而共圖喪日之謀則我中華民國。始可永存而不亡。而此國慶紀念日。亦可永留而不廢矣。</p>
<h3>痛哭流涕話國慶</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>暴日積極進迫的形勢。已是嚴重得　　莫可名狀了。這二十天之中。把我遼吉兩省試行變相的獨立。今且沿南滿路進犯。派大隊軍艦來華挑釁。飛機轟炸錦州。氣呑山河兇燄濔天。看來亡國滅</p>
<h3>國慶日之哭聲</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>鑼皷喧天。爆竹震地。旗彩　　飄揚。萬衆歡騰此何日乎莊嚴燦爛之中華民國。正於此雙十日中成立也。</p>
<p>回憶辛亥起義。先烈灑熱血。擲頭顱。犧牲生命。卒完成革命。奠定國基。諸烈士於地下睹此一年一度之國慶。當亦含笑瞑目欣喜無量也。</p>
<p>乃民國成立第二十年之慶典未至。倭人突進兵佔我土地殺我人民。我錦繡河山。遂被汚於倭人鐵歸之下。痛哉　　今年之雙十國慶。不復現往年之歡娱景象。蓋倭人方在我境内耀武揚威。我失地未復。我奇仇未報。但聞難區同胞之悲啼。與地下烈士之哭聲。遙相應答而已。我同胞作保感想。耶種的大禍。已在目前。哀哉同胞。這「亡國滅種」的話决不是神經過敏之談。我們固然信賴政府「一致鎭靜聽候解。决」然而「鎭靜」到什麽程度。到什麽時候。可給我我一個切實的答復。但我敢敬告政府。「不抵抗日自殺。」「鎭靜是麻醉。」「信仰國聯是迷夢。」這三條路都走不通。還是别求生路。</p>
<p>京粤兩方的和議。據説到月底才能開。此廖還在磋商什麽條件。不是促成亡國的現象麽。試問内部爭奪權利要緊。還是救民救國要緊。父母姊妹兄弟妻子都陷入火坑裏。兄弟倆坐視不去救。還在旁邊説冷話。這還是人的心理麽口口聲聲説愛民衆救黨國。這兒便是最有效的試騐場合了。</p>
<p>回顧二十度的國慶。有幾次倒還勉强苦中作樂。今年呢。提起國慶。痛哭流涕。幾乎不知所止。唉假使没有軍閥專横刮地皮。没有官僚簸弄説是非。有賢明廉潔强固的政府。有堅毅奮門團結的民衆。那裏會起内戰。召外侮。更那裏會遭暴日侵奪東北蹂躪國土的滔天大禍。所以誰該負起「害國殃民」的罪孽。是顯而易見的事了。以前種種。不堪回首從今而後如何做起。大家應該覺悟吧。</p>
<p>今天是國慶。我們惟有同心協。力來喚醒國魂復活。永遠地復活。</p>
<h3>二十年之雙十節</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>雙十節。是中華民國成立的紀念日。　　本是可慶的日子。今年的雙十節。尤其是可慶可賀。因爲今年民國恰届雙十。是二十大慶是雙料的雙十節。譬如一個人。常年的雙十節是小生日。今年的雙十節。是正生日。所以分外可慶。那知事與願違。這可愛的民國。命途多舛大有一年不如一年之概。試觀今日。愁雲毒霧。　漫神州。此一歲中。内有赤匪之猖獗。石部之叛變。而水災之慘。更爲近代所罕有。再加强鄰相迫。萬寳山慘案起於先。朝鮮屠殺華僑　於後今更甘冒天下之大不韙出兵强佔我東三省。殘殺我同胞。創痕纍纍。國恥重重來日大難猶方興未艾。逢此良辰。惟有效賈生之痛哭流涕。雖欲顏爲歡。有所不能。眞所謂「時逢佳節倍傷神」。吊且不假。慶於何有。但是以前種種。譬如昨日死。以後種種。譬如今日生。欲創造新生命。全在我國民的努力。此後最要的工作。（一）厲行經濟絶交。以制彼之死命。（二）實行軍事訓練。以培養我之實力。（三）年儲救國基金。以振興海軍。十年生聚。十年敎訓。臥薪嘗膽。永矢弗諼。奇恥大辱。終有　雪之日。還我河山。重建莊嚴燦爛的民國。那末年年雙十節自　歡欣鼓舞。不致如今日之暗淡無光了。</p>
<h3>抵貨簡言</h3>
<p>— 沈廷凱</p>
<p>就予個人十年以來致力國貨並觀察　　歷次抵制日貨結果之經騐所得。有簡撟之言以告國人。</p>
<p>若勸十人百人千人萬人以至數千萬億人之不用日貨。何如向少數之握有駐日辦貨資格者。及向日本有定貨資格者。及大小號家批發日貨資格者。並及駐在上海之各省市各大城鎭之辦貨客商。作精密之調查。定嚴厲之處置。勸之不改。繼之以警警。之不改。公告於世。更施以苛酷之儆戒則人雖昧昧亦知回頭矣。　　凡事有其流。當有其源。欲狂瀾之挽。正非難事。故抵制日貨之根本解决。一方面雖黨努力於國貨之替代。及原料之替代。但一方面認清源流而行。誠能事半功倍。終收巨大效力。</p>
<p>若徒逞一時之奮。而忘其所以。狂呼亂喊。不尋源流。宜其往事之徒　無益。明達諸公其以鄙言爲然。乎（不受酬）</p>
<h3>我們的義士</h3>
<p>— 林儷琴</p>
<p>這雖是假想的戰爭。但這戰機終有爆發的一日。</p>
<p>果然這不幸的戰事已發生了。敵國的軍隊仗着節節勝利的氣燄已在攻打我們的山海關了。那不幸的椎心的噩耗就一批一地震聾了我們的耳膜。</p>
<p>我們的關外領土咧。被敵國佔領了關外的同胞咧。被敵人屠殺了。敵人刦去了我們的物產豐富的富源之地。敵國的旗幟玷了我國的版圖。敵國境。不久就要打到我們家裏了。</p>
<p>同胞們。這是最痛心的事。你們的財產。敵人要來搶刦的。你們的妻女。敵人要來姦殺的。敵人要手刄你的父母。宰割你的自身啊。這是何等痛心的慘劇。五歲的小孩。要剖腹剜腸。　　在敵人的鐵蹄下。你預備把你的財產搬運到那裡去。你還想把妻女隱藏在甚麽地方。父母到那裡去避難。你自身怎様保全生命。你該知道獷悍兇惡的敵人們。他們是來滅我國家。覆我宗族的。</p>
<p>唉。我們的大中華民國呢。大中華民國的民族呢。</p>
<p>「國難臨頭。止是男兒爲國捐軀的時候。」</p>
<p>這是一個人中華民國的民大聲疾呼的。我舉不出他底姓名我祇知道他已振刷着精神奮發了勇氣。追隨着我們的戰士同赴國難去了。</p>
<p>他是我們的義士。</p>
<p>但我曉得。我們的戰士都有「笑臥沙塲與國俱存」的决心我們的義士也不僅有這一個多咧全中國的人民都是我們的義士。</p>
<p>衝鋒。肉博是我們底義士勇於前進的。</p>
<p>禦寇。殺敵。是我們的義士希望効力的。</p>
<p>還有我們的戰士。許身爲國的勇武的戰士們。努力禦寇殺敵的戰士們。勇於衝鋒肉搏的戰士們。</p>
<p>我們雖不　望殲盡敵人。我們也不忍傾敵人底宗族。擈滅敵國。但我們爲了國家。爲了民族。爲了父母妻女。爲了生命財產。爲了丨唉。爲了我們將來的義士。那無壧的被敵人剖腹剜腸的可憐的孩子們。我們應當要急起直追。同我們的義士站在一道防綫。</p>
<p>當然的。我們的國家。民族。誰敢斷定要滅亡在敵人底鐵蹄之下。謂瞧吧。</p>
<p>這是我們的國家。民族最光榮的一頁歷史。雖不僅是我們的義士的豐功偉續。我們還應得歌頌我們的戰士。</p>
<p>在這一次最後的决戰時。我們的義士追隨着勇武的戰士們出發到前方去了。殲殺敵軍去了唉。不幸。敵方飛來一個槍彈。正打着我們的義士的胸膛我們的義士忍着這如同萬箭穿心的痛苦。振臂一呼。領導着戰士們衝進了敵軍的防綫。殲殺了無數敵人。手刄了許多敵軍的官長。搶奪到敵國的旗　。他等到敵軍在紛紛　敗的時光。他狂笑着拗斷了敵國的旗桿。扯破了敵國的國徽。　着他胸膛上的從創口流出來的鮮熱的血。我們的義士才很愉快地笑臥在沙場之上。。　　請瞧吧。這就是我們全中國的羲士中的一個。</p>

<h3>學生抗日救國會</h3>
<p>— 曉通</p>
<p>自日本帝國主羲假借了中村事出兵東省、以武力强佔了我瀋陽、長春、營口、撫順等地、焚燒機關、毁掘鐵路、槍殺人民、刦掠商店、拘押軍政長官、勒繳軍警槍械、演人世未有的暴行、以遂其大陸政策的迷夢以來、民氣激昻、凡有血氣者誰能忍此奇大恥辱、抗日救國的呼聲、已轟動了全國的民衆、在這千鈞一髮民族存亡的關頭、抗日救國會的組織、已成爲勢不待緩的工作了、</p>
<p>青年學生自五四運動曾一度暴發以來、因被束於各方的節制、致失去了活動的機會、但青年學生都是血氣方剛富於情感者、任何一種剌激、都可以引起他們的呼號和奮鬬、何况這次暴日出兵東省、强佔我國領土是一件奇大的恥辱呢、學生因有的勇氣又恢復了、學生固月的精神又振用了、學生抗日救國會的組織、任何學校都已在着手進行并已開始工作了、這眞可以説是學生運動的復興期、實在、在這國難當頭、處在後知後覺地位的青年、誰也不應該這様爲國而熱烈的幹呢、就是爲國而犧牲、也是值得的呀、</p>
<p>埃校在敎育的立場上、還没有得到相當的地位和榮譽、這最大的原因、是爲了埃校年齡的幼稚和埃校學生少接近民衆的緣故、這次奇大的恥辱活現在埃校學生的眼前、埃校學生在四週環境的包圍裏、居然打破了沉寂、首先組織了學生抗日救國會、拼着青年的勇氣、振起精神來、爲國家的存亡、熱烈的幹起抗日工作來、他一方面通電主張以革命手段從速收復被佔各地、并組織救國義勇軍、日夜訓練、以作政府的後盾、一方面幹不層工作、分隊向附近民衆宣傳、以冀喚起民衆、失禦外侮、</p>
<p>的確、抗日救國會的最大工作、還是在幹下層的、因爲誰都知道、我國的民衆、除了少數能了解國事外、差不多大半都在睡夢中、民衆是政府的後盾、在這千鈞一髮、民族存亡的今日、再不喚起民衆、團結起來共禦外侮、試問、政府能以何種手段伸雪這奇大的恥辱、</p>
<p>現在、學生抗日救國會已紛紛的成立了、學生抗日救國會的工作、已在熱烈的進行、但我們始終不能疏忽、學生抗日救國會的最大工作、還是在幹下層的向民間去、</p>
<h3>抗日意志</h3>
<p>— 民因</p>
<p>天明了、在南洋高商的初中部讀書的錢很早便起來、平時起來很遲的錢君忽地今天特别趕早起身、在錢的一般蠢呆的小朋友們看來、原是很奇怪的、那知天眞的錢的心靈已罩上了霧悲哀、霧一般的憂鬱、同時在這悲哀和憂鬱之網裏、藏着多最的激昻的意志、那意志便是從他的「愛國熱忱」裏胎生出來的啊、　　事情是這様的、自從錢君看到申報上的「日本兵佔領遼寗」的消息、他便什麽情都感不到興趣了、在平時、他是喜歡拍球游泳的、現在他是終日沉思着、像什麽惡劣的命運很快的要加到他的身上來、他便天天想着怎様抗日的方法、他想他這様的年齡是不適宜於開戰的、和日人開戰、那豈不是送死、他的拿不動刀槍的兩隻嫩手怎様去打仗呢、他繼續地想着、他旣然是没有能力去實現他第一個志願了、那末、怎様辦呢、旣然自己是中國國民之一份子、會旁觀着矮奴來佔領我們的領土、殘殺我們的同胞麽、那是决不忍的、他想、假如他要這様的做、「醉生夢死」地活着、那還不如死的好、所以、他想出第二個計劃了、</p>
<p>已是七點鐘了、太陽在天空裏旋轉、在射出紅的光綫、晨曉的網也漸漸的收縮起來、懷着愛國熱忱的錢君踏着地上的太陽、心頭的血也像陽光般紅、　　他激昻地走着、沉思着、他想到普法之戰的「最後的一課」、他想到法國那時的人民的興盛的民族意識、他像是看到了普法之戰的一幕、血染的死屍、民衆的哭聲、和那先生警戒學生的話句句都是强有力的、剌激性的、深沉的、同時學生們的敏悟和感動的態度都表現得十二分明顯、尤其是感動性的表現出之於小學生、那眞使我國的敎育界羞死、他想到中國難免没有讀中國文字的一日、他想着自己是中國的學生、是未來的中國的主人翁、　應當負擔更重大的「使命」、甚至流血的「使命」爲整個的民族而流血的「使命」、他想到這些情緒、他更加激昻起來、興奮起來、他重温他到民衆邊去的演講詞、宣傳詞、</p>
<p>他不自覺地跨過了自己的學枃丨南洋高商丨他的意識使他前進、使他不進去如平時一様、他的意識使他知道今天的自己的職務是比進學校讀書重大得多、比什麽都重大、他大踏步地走過去、走向他的目的地去、</p>
<p>已近八點鐘了、横浜路一帶的民衆都在買菜、紅綠色的菜籃一隻隻的由小賣的肩上挑過來、挑過去、許多年輕的女子在選揀了各種菜蔬、</p>
<p>我們的年輕的富於愛國熱腸的錢君便乘機跑到人叢中去、踏上一長凳、開始演説起來、</p>
<p>「諸位同胞、你們知道今天是什麽日子、今天是我國受着暴日殘殺的蹂躙的日期中的一個最危險的日子、你們不是已經知道遼寗一帶的日人的行動麽、你們不是已經看到流血的同胞們、慘死的同胞的使人哭泣、使人憤慨的照片麽、我想、假如你們有一點愛國心、假如你們知道你們是中國的人民、不是别國的人民、我想你們一定已經知道的了、一定是流過涙了、一定是有過奮鬬的决心了、但是、不是一個空有决心便便有成效的、那是需要我們長時期的耐苦、耐勞的毅力去奮鬬、各人各擔負自己能擔負的工作去奮鬬、奮鬬、奮鬬·········」</p>
<p>他講到「奮鬬、奮鬬、奮鬬、」的六個字、他是咬緊牙齒講的、在他的很高爽的嗓子裏、像含有哭的意識、同時這個哭聲不是嫩弱的是積極的、</p>
<p>一般民衆們都被他的激昻的演講詞激動、都站着脚聽、他們覺得這個十五六歲的學生的話眞是感動極了、遠超過一般「敷衍塞責」的演講詞他的話雖是簡單、但句句是有力、句句是熱血裏露出來的、他們覺得現在的中國正需要這様的青年、他們希望個個青年都像他一様有頭腦、有見解、個個受他的同化、有意識的同化、他們自己呢、也感到他的話是他們的指南針、救國的指南針、同時覺得他們自己不去擔任那能擔任的工作、是一個極可恥的事情、</p>
<p>錢君演講之後、拭額上的汗、走回家去、</p>
<p>他很清楚聽到幾個人在誠摰地説、　　「像這様的年表的學生、是有抗日的意志的」、</p>
<h3>兵式操</h3>
<p>— 冰攝</p>
<h3>哀音</h3>
<p>— 曉光</p>
<p>彷彿是三時左右的深夜、同學們正睡得像饅頭一般的吐出「嘶嘶」的鼾聲、突然的、不知從什麽地方傳來驚人的聲嚮、我懶懶洋洋地在這充溢着恐怖的黑暗的寢家裏、將頭向外窺探側耳傾聽、那怪可怕的嚮聲終於漸漸地挨近來了、一啊喲、這是怎麽一回事呀、」陰森而肅殺的氣象緊緊地包圍着我、怕得我不得不把這句溜到嘴邊的話囫圇的呑下了肚底　　雖説是五月的初夏、但深夜寒氣、畢竟難以消受的、我釘也似的向窗　上約摸釘了半句鐘、</p>
<p>在天邊在那遼遠的天邊、一片片的烏雲遮蔽了普照的月光、大地於是撤下了一層厚的黑幕、「這也許象徵今晚的不幸變故的預兆吧、」我不覺起了這個欵賣、</p>
<p>霎時、電燈忽然亮起來了、我藉着電光的一點勇氣、於是輕輕地推着同室的應君、</p>
<p>老應经快些起來、快些起來··········電燈不知發了什麽病症、竟在這深夜時分驟然亮起來了、捉住了賊骨頭也説不定··········」</p>
<p>我雖是這様説但心裏總担心着有什麽不幸的事情立刻會落在我們的頭上　　哎······什麽、什麽時候了、··········」　　應君搓了搓他朦朧的睡眼、驚訝地向我、</p>
<p>「大概是三點多鐘了吧、老應、今晚確有事情了、不然、爲什麽在這個時候會亮起電燈來呢··········不要睡了、索性把老陳也拖起來、大家一同去探個究竟吧、」</p>
<p>於是、我們三人各佔有着莫名的恐懼、三人緊緊地攙着手、輕輕地從寢室出去了、</p>
<p>「擦、擦、擦、······嗦、嗦、嗦·····」的聲音迎面而來了、</p>
<p>「哎喲、不對、是丘八太爺呢、不是玩的、快回去吧、··········」我怕得幾乎説不出話來、拚命地拉着應君和陳君的手、他倆確是在那裏發抖了、</p>
<p>趕快將行李整好、」我們三人剛坐在床沿砰砰地跳着心時、兩個荷槍實彈的丘八太爺進來、他們重重地、像戒嚴時喝口令似的喝了一聲、並且用他們猙獰的臉監視着我們的行動、</p>
<p>我害怕着、四肢像斷了骨骼似的戰戰兢的整理起我的行李及零碎書藉、　　「快些、時候不早了、已是四點多鐘了、」</p>
<p>一個丘八太爺在我書架上翻來翻去、也許他翻的不耐煩了、才這様逼迫着我們、</p>
<p>空氣是那様地騷動、很明顯地、各房間的同學也在那裏發出整理行李的雜亂交　樂、</p>
<p>「你們立刻把行李搬至校門口、再辦公廳丨丨其實是辦公處丨丨去領旅費洋念元、」他倆説後去了、</p>
<p>「啊、原來是這様結果了我們、······晤、還有念元作旅費、這眞是「悲天憫人、」「樂善好施」呢、」</p>
<p>我向他倆這様説、但他倆的臉上已泛起一層慘白的微笑了、</p>
<p>夜色未破、我們百餘同學連同行李即被搬塲汽車向渺茫的地方疾駛而去了　　於是、流浪的生活在我面前展開了、····················　　在被逐的第二天、我即拖着沉重的身體到江灣來了、在這里、不得不感謝房東王師母的寛大的胸懷、因爲好目覩我們這班不幸的遭遇的可憐、便給我們幾個同學不出一錢房租的住下了、並且、還給我們定了一份報绒、這怎不使我們五體投地呢、</p>
<p>我每天翻閲報上的招生廣告、總是予我以很大的失望、失望畢竟是失望、更有一點兒什麽補救的方法呢、我雖是暫時有了棲所、但究竟是很短促的時候、一以後將怎様處置自己呢、「想到了這一個問題、我便茫然了、</p>
<p>二星期以後、</p>
<p>生活一天天地枯窘起來、精神上也更感苦痛了、在人地生疏的滬上就是要</p>

At the same time, Japanese aircraft flew in the sky, dropping leaflets saying that the Chinese army could not maintain the safety of the people, causing bandits to harass, so the Japanese army came to protect them, etc. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Beiping on the 9th, reporting that there were still more than 300 Japanese soldiers in Liaoyuan, with 6 cannons, 4 mortars, and 8 machine guns.

<h3>Plan to Sign Secret Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Jinkai, Xi Qia, and others have recently planned to sign a secret treaty with Japan consisting of eight articles, which was discovered and revealed by the Northeast People's Association: (1) Establish a Manchu-Mongolian independent state; (2) Cede Yingkou, Andong, Niuzhuang, and Haicheng counties to Japan; (3) Japanese people to reside in the interior; (4) Japan to exercise the right of residence in the interior; (5) Recognize the right of Japanese people to lease land for commerce; (6) Railways in the three provinces to be jointly operated by China and Japan; (7) Complete the Jihui Railway; (8) Permanently suppress anti-Japanese movements in the Eastern Provinces.

<p>Damage Situation in Jinzhou after the Japanese Aircraft Bombing</p>
<h3>Liaoning Provincial Government Office Almost Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>Sixteen Killed, Two Injured</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Liaoning Provincial Government Office in Jinzhou was almost completely destroyed by Japanese aircraft bombing. It is reported that Mi Chunlin is still safe. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>As a result of the Japanese aircraft bombing of Jinzhou, sixteen people were killed, mostly railway workers, and nine were injured, including one Russian teacher from Jiaotong University. Although the Japanese aircraft dropped 30 bombs, targeting the administrative office, none of the provincial government officials were injured. Another telegram states that the Chairman of Liaoning Province, Mi Chunlin, told a Reuters special correspondent this morning that China has always faithfully complied with the advice of the League of Nations, but Japan has always arbitrarily violated international obligations, such as the recent bombing of Jinzhou, which is one example. The Liaoning Provincial Government continues to perform its duties here, pending instructions from the central government. Today, the Reuters special correspondent went to various places to inspect and personally witnessed three holes made by bombs at the radio station, four bomb holes in the densely populated area outside the East Gate, and ten bomb holes at Jiaotong University, which is the location of the Provincial Government. At the time this telegram was sent, it was rumored that 30 Japanese aircraft were flying towards the city. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Manipulating the Administration of Liaoning Province</h3>
<p>Honjo Shigeru Issues Proclamation</p>
<p>(Beiping) Honjo Shigeru issued a proclamation because officials of public offices and institutions, as well as the people, are fleeing in increasing numbers. The proclamation roughly states: "Our army is punishing the Liaoning Provincial Government. The main locations along the railways in Liaoning and Jilin provinces have already been occupied by us. We now intend for our army to take a guiding position, so that the former officials in Liaoning can fully implement benevolent governance. We sincerely hope that officials of all counties and governments in the province can understand this intention, and for the time being, honestly manage county affairs and maintain public order in accordance with regulations. If any farmers or merchants violate this, they will not be spared. Furthermore, merchants and people of all counties should quickly resume their respective businesses. If anyone disrupts order or spreads rumors, our military police will regard them as enemies of the good people and punish them severely. All officials and people must comply with this." (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Applies for</p>
<h3>League of Nations to Convene Early</h3>
<p>The Situation in the Eastern Provinces Becomes Increasingly Serious</p>
<p>Meeting Expected on the 12th</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chinese representative Dr. Shi Zhaoji officially applied today for the League of Nations Administrative Council to convene early, as the situation in Manchuria is becoming increasingly serious and cannot be delayed. Dr. Shi has not yet invoked Articles 15 and 16 of the League of Nations Charter to file a petition, apparently awaiting instructions from his national government. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Due to the serious situation between China and Japan, the League of Nations Administrative Council may convene early on the 12th of this month. All parties in the League of Nations are now eager for all foreign ministers to attend, and British representative Cecil should also attend. This is seen as a very important aspect. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Reuters in London reports that Lord Reading, the British Prime Minister, is expected to attend when the League of Nations Administrative Council meets to discuss the Manchurian incident. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Tonight, the League of Nations received reports of Japanese army aircraft bombing Jinzhou and was extremely shocked. With this action by the Japanese army, the League of Nations Council will definitely reconvene on the 14th to consider the situation in the Eastern Provinces. It is generally believed here that the recent developments in Sino-Japanese relations have created the most serious situation the League of Nations has ever encountered. In recent days, the news from the Eastern Provinces received by the League of Nations has become increasingly serious. People in the League of Nations have a strong impression that the Japanese government has lost control over its military (especially those in the Eastern Provinces), and the expression of anti-Japanese sentiment by the Chinese people is also becoming increasingly strong. Conflicts will inevitably occur thereafter. It is now expected that the Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji will make another appeal to the Council based on Article 15 of the League of Nations Charter. Therefore, the League of Nations Secretariat is currently contacting the governments of the elected Council members, requesting them to send the most powerful officials to attend the meeting on the 14th, and hoping that the United States will continue to support the League of Nations in resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. (8th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese representative Yoshizawa has recently reported to the League of Nations Council the details of the evacuation of Japanese residents in the three eastern provinces as evidence of unrest in the Eastern Provinces. The most important of these is that 640 women and children in Harbin have been moved to safe places; 230 Japanese residents in Jilin have been moved to Zhengjiatun, and the original Japanese residents in Zhengjiatun have now been completely moved to Sipingjie; 100 Korean residents in Fakumen have now been moved to Tieling; 150 Japanese residents and 100 Korean residents in Huichun territory are now residing in the consulate. It is also said that the anti-Japanese movement in various Chinese provinces has spread extremely widely. At present, Japanese residents in Nanhua are successively moving to warships. 500 Japanese residents in Hong Kong and 197 Japanese residents in Kowloon have all moved to designated evacuation locations. (8th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese representative Yoshizawa sent a document to the League of Nations Council today, actually pointing out that there were scattered soldiers harassing the Eastern Provinces as a reason for delaying the withdrawal of troops. It is claimed that 700 scattered soldiers set fire in Niuzhuang, and the situation of 20 Japanese residents in the area is unknown. There are also 300 scattered soldiers attacking Donggou (transliteration), and they are currently at war. The safety of Japanese residents in the area is worrisome. In addition, bandits are rampant in Haiyuan, Tieling, and Fushun, and 40 Japanese residents were robbed and killed by bandits, and 17 houses were burned. Therefore, the Japanese army in Manchuria is gradually withdrawing troops from peaceful areas and sending troops to protect unsafe areas. Although Japan has advised China to take the necessary measures to protect Japanese residents, Japan will still take extreme measures and order Japanese residents to move to safe places. Although Japan has warned China, the atrocities of scattered soldiers and bandits in the interior of Manchuria against Japanese and Korean residents are increasing day by day. In addition, the anti-Japanese movement in various parts of China is also greatly expanding, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. It is also said that the Chinese authorities cannot restrain the scattered soldiers, so the Japanese army has to protect the lives of Japanese and Korean people. (8th National News Agency Dispatch) (Nanjing) The diplomatic community received a telegram from Geneva stating that the Secretariat of the League of Nations was greatly shocked after receiving news of the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou. The League of Nations generally believes that this Sino-Japanese issue is the most serious incident since the establishment of the League of Nations. Recent telegrams from the three eastern provinces received in Geneva prove that the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. The League of Nations is confident that the Japanese government has lost the ability to command its soldiers. The League of Nations Secretariat has notified representatives of various countries to express accurate opinions at the meeting of the Administrative Council, and at the same time hopes to obtain the assistance of the United States.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Consul-General in Shenyang reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that yesterday Chinese soldiers in Jinzhou first shot at Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, so they bombed Chinese military installations. It is reported that a large number of Chinese troops are gathering near Jinzhou, preparing to attack the South Manchuria Railway area, so a squadron of aircraft was sent to Jinzhou for reconnaissance. It is also said that the rumor of a large number of Chinese troops gathering near Jinzhou occurred at the same time as the discovery of plainclothes soldiers and spies. These spies were sent by Zhang Xueliang to disrupt the peace and order of the railway area. These secret workers gathered scattered Chinese soldiers along the railway, preparing to attack the weakest points of the Japanese garrison. Today, the Ministry of War issued a statement on the bombing of Jinzhou, denying the claim that Japanese aircraft distributed leaflets discrediting Zhang Xueliang. The Japanese explanation for the bombing of Jinzhou is from the perspective of military necessity, which is not difficult to understand. However, most foreign observers here believe that the Japanese government is now in a difficult position. However, officials are clearly worried that this action will cause international repercussions, but they are still trying to maintain calm and pretend to be satisfied with explaining that this action was unavoidable. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the Japanese government, although deeply regretting the necessity of the Japanese aircraft bombing Jinzhou, has now decided to acknowledge that this action by the Japanese military authorities in Manchuria was compelled by circumstances. The government has telegraphed the Japanese representative Yoshizawa in Geneva with the explanations of the Japanese Consul-General in Shenyang, including the fact that Chinese soldiers fired at Japanese aircraft when they flew over Jinzhou.

<h3>Japanese Troops Ravage Shenyang</h3>
<p>Administer Justice, Release Prisoners</p>
<p>Bandits Collude with Police to Loot in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>(Beiping) The remaining officials of the Shenyang Municipal Government, who have now come to Beiping from Yingkou, spoke of how the Japanese are expanding their organization, encompassing all of Fengtian (Shenyang) outside the leased territories. The administration of justice has also been taken over, and all prisoners have been released. The proclamations issued are all stamped with the old municipal government seal, and they were unable to obtain Mayor Li's private seal. The original documents were all taken away and not left behind. Shenyang bandits are now colluding with the police to loot in broad daylight, and nine out of ten households have been emptied. There is no one left in the hotels, and stores open and close at irregular times. Little inventory is being sold, and food is only available to old customers who knock on the door, and the price varies depending on the currency used. The Japanese are now handing over the grain stored in the grain factory to charitable organizations to manage cheap rice sales and are shipping grain from the Shenhai Railway for relief. It is impossible to guarantee whether this can be maintained. (9th Dispatch) (Beiping) A telegram from Shanhaiguan states: (1) The former Jilin Military Governor Sun Liechen's residence in Shenyang was looted by Koreans on the night of the 8th, with property losses of approximately five million. The Japanese army did not intervene. (2) The Japanese army stated that they would never withdraw their troops. Solid trenches have been dug outside the Xiguan and Nanguan of Shenyang as preparations for war. (3) The Japanese Municipal Public Office, on the pretext of providing relief, withdrew 500,000 yuan from the Dong San Sheng Official Bank and 2,800 shi of red grain from the Grain Depot. In reality, a very small amount was used for relief to deceive people, and the rest was confiscated by the Municipal Public Office. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Attitude of the Japanese Military</h3>
<p>Submits Opinions to the Government</p>
<p>Blames Everything on China</p>
<p>Still Insists on Not Withdrawing Troops</p>
<p>Unreasonably Obstructs Interference</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the three heads of the army, the Minister of War Minami, the Chief of the General Staff Kanaya, and the Inspector General of Military Education Muto, gathered to discuss the future policy regarding the Manchurian Incident and the attitude of the army. They unanimously decided to respond to the government with the following opinions:</p>
<p>1. The Manchurian Incident was caused by unlawful acts by China, so all responsibility should be borne by China.</p>
<p>2. Cases such as special rights regarding railways and commercial rights in Manchuria and Mongolia should be resolved during this period. The realization of a new regime should be negotiated as a local issue.</p>
<p>3. Troops will be withdrawn only after a new regime is established and the lives and property of Japanese residents are guaranteed.</p>
<p>4. If anti-Japanese activities continue to occur after the protest issued to the Nanjing government on the 9th, further protests should be lodged.</p>
<p>5. Explain the truth to the League of Nations and seek their understanding. This is a local issue between China and Japan. If they want to interfere, they should be urged to reflect on themselves.</p>
<p>The above is the basis of the decision. Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, Vice-Minister Sugiyama and Deputy Chief of Staff Ninomiya and others created a concrete plan. (9th Den-tsu Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Has No Intention of Withdrawing Troops</h3>
<p>Various Institutions in the Two Provinces Have Not Yet Been Handed Over</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang once asked a military attache from a certain embassy to go to Shenyang to investigate the truth and inquire about the Japanese side's views on troop withdrawal. He returned to Beiping last night and met with Zhang to report that Japan has absolutely no intention of withdrawing troops, and observing the various military preparations, it is entirely a permanent policy. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Beijing from Beiping on the 8th, saying that the important towns currently under the control of the violent Japanese include Yingkou, Dashiqiao, Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, Tieling, and other places. The communication agencies in these places have also been occupied. It has been found that the Japanese army stationed in Shenyang sometimes enters the city and sometimes withdraws during the day, returning at night. In short, all of these places are under the control of the violent Japanese, and the advance and retreat of the Japanese army are constantly changing. To this day, all institutions in the two provinces are still in the hands of the Japanese army and have not been handed over, making it impossible to restore the original situation. The Japanese claim of troop withdrawal is contrary to the facts. (9th Dispatch) Li Zhensheng</p>

<p>Japanese Government</p>
<h3>Sends Protest Note to Our Country</h3>
<p>Delivered to Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Shigemitsu Today</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The full text of the protest in the form of a memorandum that the Japanese government sent to the National Government on the 9th was wired to Minister Shigemitsu last night, and Minister Shigemitsu will personally hand it over to the acting Minister of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing tomorrow. In order to declare Japan's attitude to China and foreign countries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the full text of the protest today. The general content is as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Manchurian Incident was actually triggered by years of anti-Japanese thought in China. Our troops had no choice but to take self-defense measures to respond to the challenge of the Chinese army. Therefore, the responsibility for this incident should be borne by the Chinese government. The Japanese government has repeatedly requested the Chinese government to severely suppress the anti-Japanese movement in various parts of China, but as a result, the anti-Japanese movement has become even more intense. Various behaviors, such as the so-called decision to cut off economic relations with Japan, inspection, detention, coercion, and atrocities, have been endless. There were even resolutions to execute those who buy and sell Japanese goods. Incidents of atrocities and persecution against Japanese residents have occurred one after another, and some of the residents have fled one after another.</p>
<p>2. China's anti-Japanese movement is directly guided by the Central Party Department, which has the closest relationship with the Chinese government, and is contrary to the spirit stipulated in the existing treaties between China and Japan, violating justice and contrary to good ideas, and is an act of openly acknowledging armed hostility.</p>
<p>3. At the League of Nations Council meeting, the Chinese representative had the phrase "guarantee to prevent the expansion of the situation." Now, the Chinese government's adoption of the means of not suppressing anti-Japanese activities is contrary to the word "guarantee."</p>
<p>4. The Japanese government has called the Chinese government's attention to the actions of various anti-Japanese groups, and at the same time, the Chinese government should bear all responsibilities. We hereby declare a warning. (9th Den-tsu Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Telegraphed</p>
<h3>Situation of Japanese Incitement to Rebellion</h3>
<p>Providing Munitions to Mongolian Bandits</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Zhang Xueliang reporting the situation of Japanese transportation of weapons and incitement of Mongolian people to rebellion as follows: According to the telegram from Shen Zhenxian, the Magistrate of Taonan County, the Japanese army transported military vehicles with more than 30 soldiers, and it is reported that they were receiving Mongolian bandits. 2. According to a consultation from Xu Weixin, the Magistrate of Liaoyuan County, Japanese personnel are inciting Mongolian personnel to make trouble and providing munitions. On the 2nd, they handed over the supplies to Mongolian soldiers at Sanke Tree Station, and they were loaded onto more than ten ox carts and transported to the Hao area of the Bot Banner Bao Commander's camp. More than a thousand Mongolian students have gathered, including more than 30 Mongolian students who studied in Japan, and Japanese personnel are planning in the middle. 3. According to a telegram from Rong Jiuting, manager of the Tongliao San Tu Firm, on the 5th, Japanese personnel have contacted the Mongolian king, tempting him to protect his throne, secretly with the intention of surrendering. Currently, Japanese personnel are transporting munitions on three trains to Ke Tree Station on the Siping-Taonan Railway and handing them over to the Mongolian king. 4. According to a telegram from Xu Weixin, the Magistrate of Liaoyuan County, Japanese personnel are inciting Mongolian youth leaders Ganju Mononobu Baiyun Hang to take the opportunity to become independent and are coercing Bao Shan, the Bot Banner Commander, who has military power, to appoint Bolger as the commander-in-chief of the independent army. Boming has a thorough understanding of the advantages and disadvantages and firmly refuses to acknowledge this. He has already been monitored. Japanese merchants in the county secretly advised him to agree in order to avoid the youth's radical actions from falling under the hands of soldiers and to reverse the situation if he encounters an opportunity in the future, and he has made a firm decision. At this time, he was instigated and directed by Japanese personnel and coerced by the youth to agree to serve as the commander of the autonomous army. In the near future, he will launch an attack and advance toward Tongliao. Japanese personnel are providing munitions in abundance, with 3,000 guns, 1 million bullets, 4 mortars, 4 machine guns, and 2 aircraft, all from our arsenal. Japanese personnel are using Mongolian soldiers as a vanguard to achieve their purpose of creating chaos and reap the benefits, and all counties in the northwest are in danger. 5. According to a telegram from the magistrate of Liaoyuan County, after the Japanese incited the Mongolian incident, the magistrate believed that the border with the county was of great importance and urged the Mongolian king's close associates to conduct practical persuasion through various channels, which has been effective. On the Wen Du King has come to the county. The Tongliao Maintenance Association has dispatched Mongolian to the Shan Jing to Shenyang to connect, and because the Bot Banner Commander also holds most of the military power, he was personally persuaded to firmly oppose this. Therefore, when Bot Banner issued guns on the 5th, no one claimed them, and Chief Han Se Wang gathered two or three hundred people. The strength in Datong Town is very small. The situation within the past few days has been relatively moderate. (9th Dispatch) Chen Xingya</p>
<h3>Talks About Situation on the Beining Line</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Xingya passed through Tianjin on a county special train at 6:00 PM on the 8th to go to Beiping. He told reporters that he had gone to Dahu Mountain to inspect. Japanese soldiers are stationed in Xinmin County. Our army avoids conflict. There are no troops stationed between Raoyang River and Xinmin County. Bandits are rampant, and our army does not dare to suppress them. Japanese soldiers sit idly by, causing the repeated occurrence of robberies. He also went to Zhangwu County for inspection and heard that a group of bandits were harassing Heishan County and had been dispersed by the county's defense team. Japanese aircraft often fly along the railway line, either scouting or dropping bombs, doing whatever they want. It was also heard that the Japanese are encouraging the princes of Inner Mongolia to become independent and are providing munitions. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Rongbao Discusses Diplomacy</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Rongbao discussed that during his tenure, he felt the Dong Province unresolved cases were delayed and ignored, and there would inevitably be a violent resolution. Japan once proposed jointly dispatching an equal number of experts from China and Japan to conduct on-the-ground investigations in Manchuria, with the principle of not causing fatal harm to each other, to find a solution. Unfortunately, this did not materialize. At this time, troop withdrawal should precede negotiations. However, we should abandon politeness and clearly understand the true situation of Dong Province diplomacy to resolutely save the country. It is not without solutions. Wang went to Tianjin yesterday to welcome his family returning from Japan. (9th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>From This Year's Double Tenth Festival to Next Year's Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>丨A Year's Plan丨</p>
<p>Today is the National Day commemoration of the 20th year [of the Republic]. Internal troubles and external aggression press together, our country is fragmented, and the people suffer immensely. Even if we want to force a smile and dispel our sorrows today, it is impossible. Rather than calling today a "National Day," it is more fitting to call it a "National Crisis."</p>
<p>The Republic of China was founded twenty years ago. Every time the "National Day" arrives, the people of the country express their fervent hopes and expectations for the unfolding future years, comparing themselves to "dying yesterday and being born today," and earnestly encouraging themselves. However, for twenty years, things have steadily deteriorated, and this year, we face an unprecedented crisis. The years drift by, the long night stretches on. If the people of the country do not awaken, when will we wait? How many more years must we wait?</p>
<p>Today, we are caught between tears and laughter. Our powerful eastern neighbor is raising its palms in jubilation, singing songs of victory. Our northeastern compatriots under violent oppression may not even be allowed to hang a national flag today. The times are critical, the situation is urgent. The coming years will be even more unthinkable. If the people of the country do not awaken, when will we wait? How many more years must we wait?</p>
<p>Now, let us list several matters as goals for the coming year's efforts. From this year's Double Tenth Festival to next year's Double Tenth Festival, we must use the power of all our citizens to promote their realization. The current national difficulties are the culmination of our nation's twenty years of inaction and complacency. It can also be seen as a test of our nation's ability to survive. It can also be seen as a driving force to help our country turn from weakness to strength. Now, let us swear a final oath: "Yesterday is dead. Today we swear to be born anew." Brightness lies ahead, the whip urges us from behind. The people of the country, let us identify our goals and exert all our strength to strive together. (1) Elevate Civil Rights</p>
<p>"Civil Rights" are above all else in a democracy. The people are the masters of the country. Civil rights are inherent and not subject to any restrictions. A people without rights is a deformed slave, and the true meaning of "democracy" is lost. A true revolutionary party must be based on the broad masses of the people, a party that strives for the interests of the people must foster civil rights, and take civil rights as the party's rights. Only when civil rights are great will party rights also be great. In recent years, party rights have surpassed civil rights, suppressing civil rights, gradually forming a struggle between party rights and civil rights. As a result, civil rights are small, and party rights are also small. In a country, there is no central power that can control the entire country. Therefore, the people desire peace, but peace is difficult to achieve. The people demand resistance against the strong and violence, but the government still does not resist. In the coming year, the entire nation and the ruling party must unanimously recognize that civil rights are above all else. Without elevating civil rights, there is no way to protect the nation and enrich people's lives. The people should use their own great strength to elevate the "civil rights" they should enjoy. And the party that serves the people should foster the extension of civil rights, to conform to the justice of "the world belongs to all." (2) Build a Clean Government</p>
<p>"Build a clean government," "Overthrow corrupt officials." After the revolution, the calls were extremely high. However, judging from the facts, it is still mostly disappointing. Taxes are heavy, the people are poor, but the officials are not. For example, there are huge water conservancy funds, but river management is not improved. There are huge construction funds, but construction is minimal. The people are submerged in floods and cannot be saved. Foreign aggression is urgent and cannot be resisted. How can this be accidental? Yue Wu Mu said, "If civil officials do not love money and military officials are not afraid of death, then the world will be at peace." Not loving money means being clean. Only cleanliness prevents corruption. Only when there is no corruption can political measures take the interests of the people as their premise, can there be magnificent effectiveness, and can our country gradually move towards the path of renewal. From today onwards, our entire people must use their supreme power to monitor politics and establish a clean government.</p>
<p>(3) Arm the People</p>
<p>Only the true force of the people can resist violence and save the country. Recruited troops are all professional mercenaries, driven by hunger and cold, exchanging their lives for food and clothing, with no sense of duty. They are most likely to become personal tools. Therefore, even with many soldiers, they are not only insufficient to defend the country, but also enough to disrupt it. In the coming year, we must implement the arming of the people, so that the people can effectively defend themselves. When foreign aggression comes, they can serve the country through effective channels. In peacetime, they must strengthen their bodies, practice martial arts, and prepare for resisting the strong and violent. As for active-duty soldiers, they must recognize that their duty is to protect the country and defend the people. Orders that conform to the purpose of protecting the country and defending the people must be absolutely obeyed, otherwise they will not be followed. Soldiers of the new era should obey principles, recognize their duties, and never be personal tools. They should resist foreign aggression and never participate in internal conflicts. (4) Promote Practical Industry Plans</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's entire industrial plan is a construction plan after destruction, which is also the main purpose of the revolution. After the unification of the party and the country, how many of Mr. Sun's remaining plans have been implemented? Let's not talk about the distant past, but even the opening of the Grand Canal, the management of the Yangtze River, and the guidance of the Huai River have no results. With a territory of 10,735,454 square kilometers, the country has only 12,335 kilometers of railways, 51,210 kilometers of highways, 12,988 kilometers of air routes, 91,120 kilometers of telegraph lines, and 1,105 telegraph offices. Goods are abandoned in the wild, not taken and used. Treasures are buried in the ground, not developed. Necessities for life rely on others. What is even worse is that in a country that establishes itself on agriculture, land is barren, agriculture is declining, people are leaving the fields, and agricultural production is falling. Food and clothing both rely on imports. How can a country be established with such construction? The world economy is currently depressed. Commentators say that the world economy will recover from China. In other words, if we do not develop ourselves, the great powers will take our place and put our country in a tragic situation of economic co-management or even division. Therefore, in the future, our government and our people must follow Mr. Sun's plan and earnestly promote it, striving to gradually realize it, to increase the country's production and improve our country's economic position. And within a year from today, at a minimum, we should manufacture all the Japanese goods that we are resisting today, using domestic goods as a practical substitute, for a permanent boycott.</p>
<p>(5) Improve Education</p>
<p>The bankruptcy of past education and the decline in efficiency are undeniable facts. The mission of education is to guide young people to become creators of the new era, not to cultivate successors of the old era. Therefore, school life should correspond to social life. We should break away from rote learning and guide young people to learn practical experience, production, construction, and reform capabilities. Teach them to use both their hands and their brains, to do with their hands and to pursue with their brains the reason for "doing." At the same time, we should encourage their spirit and thoughts, and guide them towards the new path of creation. Young people are the future pillars of our country, and the future life of our nation depends on them. We should never doubt or fear young people, or view them as unapproachable. We should have more contact with young people, become one with them, and provide them with support and guidance everywhere, cultivating excellent, sound, and brave citizens to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the future era. From today onwards, the people of the country should urgently devote themselves to these two ends.</p>
<p>(6) Revitalize Disaster Areas</p>
<p>This year's flood is unprecedented in nearly sixty years. Fifty million people have drowned in the floods, and sixteen provinces have become a vast sea. The magnitude of the losses is difficult to estimate. Although the floodwaters are gradually receding, the country's vitality has been severely damaged. Rescuing the disaster victims, appeasing the refugees, and restoring vitality urgently require our efforts. Although our country is currently facing foreign aggression, we should do our best to resist it, and we should not relax our disaster relief efforts in the slightest. From today onwards, our government and our people should divide our efforts to resist violence and strive to revitalize the disaster areas, planting seeds in time so that there is no barren land and no refugees on the roads. All people should resume their careers to restore our country's vitality. ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>The above six items are all practical strategies for establishing the country in the future. We hope that they will be realized in order of priority within one year. Today is the boundary stone between perishing and being born. Those who are content with inaction and laziness, please die from today. Otherwise, please accept and promote the new life of today with new ideas, a new physique, and a new spirit of courageous advancement. The rolling Yangtze River, the vast sea, the future history of a four-thousand-year-old civilized country, the future is immeasurable. Temporary haze is a spur to encourage our nation to create a new history and a new era. The people of the country, our hopes are endless.</p>

<p>Is a Touchstone for the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Manchester Guardian in London stated that the League of Nations Administrative Council must hold a special meeting on October 14 to deal with the Manchurian Incident. This matter will be a touchstone for the League of Nations. The helpless announcement by the Japanese representative in Geneva that he cannot bear the responsibility for military actions is useless. Saying that the dangerous situation will not expand, that other members of the League of Nations are bound by other matters and have no time for this, or that the Japanese government has done its best to implement the recommendations of the League of Nations Administrative Council are all irrelevant. The effectiveness of the League of Nations must now be tested. If Article 11 of the Charter is not sufficient to deal with the situation, then Article 15 of the Charter should be invoked. The urgent task is to prevent the threat of war from becoming a real war. If the League of Nations honestly reports the history and nature of the Sino-Japanese dispute, with suggestions for handling it, then saving the extremely dangerous event is still possible.

<p>Important Foreign Dispatches</p>
<p>New German Cabinet</p>
<h3>Many Hidden Reefs Ahead</h3>
<p>Nationalist Party Joins the Nationalist Opposition</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (National Press Agency) There are many hidden reefs ahead for the new German cabinet, and there are signs of a difficult birth. Rumors of an early general election are also prevalent. The latest development in the current situation is the new decision of the Nationalist Party to join the Nationalist opposition. With the party joining the opposition, the basis for Brüning's new cabinet in the parliament will be further shaken, and the parliament's reopening next week may lead to the cabinet's failure, which is also expected. Although rumors of discord between the Nationalist Party and the Prime Minister have not been officially confirmed, there is some truth to them. The leader of the party, Dr. Bengetai, is currently making no responsible statements to the outside world. However, other party leaders, such as General Siegert and Mr. Stos, will go to Harzburg on Sunday to participate in the so-called war discussion meeting convened by the Nationalist leaders to discuss various strategies for overthrowing the Brüning cabinet. As for Brüning himself, he is currently relying heavily on the President and is actively forming a cabinet. Dr. Winbold, Director of the Pigment Trust's Agricultural Department, has agreed to take on the position of Minister of Economy, and Dr. Gull has agreed to take on the position of Minister of Justice. The only important ministers still awaiting selection are the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Interior. The German Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Neurath, has been discussing with Brüning for days, but Neurath is unlikely to leave his position as Ambassador to the United Kingdom for the time being, and Brüning will ultimately have to take on the position of Foreign Minister himself. Furthermore, regarding the successor to the Minister of Interior, although the former Minister of Defense, Geissler, has exchanged views with the Prime Minister several times, recent talks have stalled. Geissler was formerly a member of the Democratic Party, but has recently joined the Farmers' Party. It is said that the Farmers' Party is opposed to Geissler joining the new cabinet. Furthermore, Geissler and the Social Democratic Party have a history of incompatibility. If Geissler joins the new cabinet, it will endanger the new cabinet's position in the parliament. Overall, the trend of the situation is that after the parliament convenes next week, Brüning will do his best to fight a desperate battle, and his most powerful weapon will be the dissolution of parliament. President Hindenburg trusts Brüning and will undoubtedly be his backing.</p>
<p>United Kingdom Suspends Gold Standard</p>
<h3>Japan Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Reuters) The impact of the United Kingdom's suspension of the gold standard is gradually being felt in Japan, especially in the shipping industry. With the value of the British pound depreciated, Japanese shipping rates are comparatively too high. Therefore, those shipping goods to and from Southeast Asia are now abandoning Japanese ships in favor of British ships. Shipping companies recently held a meeting to consider the possibility of suspending Japanese ships and renting British ships to transport goods from Australia to the Far East. According to newspaper reports, 20,000 tons of Japanese ships are currently idle, and four British ships have been rented to replace them. The Japanese business community is paying close attention to the government's economic policy. Seventeen business representatives will meet with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance on October 10 to exchange views. It is expected that the Minister of Finance and others will detail the government's current economic policy and explain the government's intention to maintain the gold standard.</p>
<p>Suspension of War Debts</p>
<h3>Issue of Extending the Period</h3>
<p>U.S. and France Will Negotiate</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (Reuters) According to those closely related to the U.S. political authorities, the United States will demand active European disarmament as the price for continuing to reduce its war debt burden. Reuters learned today that this matter will be one of the main issues discussed by President Hoover and French Prime Minister Laval when the French Prime Minister arrives here. In addition, at the Republican senators' meeting at the White House on Tuesday, only two or three senators opposed extending the suspension period, but all reserved their judgment until they had studied what measures were necessary and how to extend the period. President Hoover did not propose a practical way to extend the suspension period, but he clearly wanted to consult with the French Prime Minister as much as possible.</p>

He described the process of the illegal organization in Jilin in great detail, including inside stories that have not been seen in the newspapers. I have recorded them below. Before the Japanese intended to mobilize troops, Zhang Zuoxiang was in Jin County observing mourning. Knowing that it was unavoidable, he telegraphed Xi Qia, instructing him to adhere to a policy of non-resistance. On the morning of the 19th, news came from the Japanese army attacking the South Ridge Barracks in Changchun. Xi remained calm and went to the Confucius Temple to pay his respects as usual. After returning to the provincial government from the ceremony, he summoned military and political figures to secretly discuss and decide to order the troops stationed in the provincial capital to immediately head to the four countryside areas to show avoidance of conflict. He also urgently telegraphed the five town guards and the brigade departments and county magistrates throughout the province, strictly ordering them to protect Japanese and Korean residents. If the Japanese army came, they must not resist. He also contacted Mr. Ishiya, the Japanese Consul-General in Jilin, stating that he would be responsible for protecting the overseas Chinese. However, with the troops being transferred out, there were only a thousand or so police officers left, which was not enough to provide comprehensive care. At the same time, people were in turmoil and seemed somewhat discouraged. On the 21st, upon hearing that the Japanese army had decided to come to Jilin, Xi sent Counselor An Yuzhen, Director of Foreign Affairs Shi Liben, and Japanese advisor to the border defense Da Po and two other people on a special train to welcome the Japanese army at the Hewanzi train station. When the Japanese army arrived at the station, Xi led the representatives to greet them and met with the commander of the 2nd Division of the Japanese Army, Domen Niro. That evening, Domen informed Xi that all weapons must be handed over completely by 5:00 PM the next day, and the troops that had already left the provincial capital must also turn in their weapons. Xi explained that it was physically impossible to do so, and on the afternoon of the 23rd, he was greatly embarrassed by Domen at Nagoya (Japanese Army Headquarters). After various explanations, he finally gained their understanding and they did not pursue the weapons any further. Domen then turned to press Xi to form an independent government, which not only had to secede from the Northeast, but also had to be free from the orders of the National Government. Xi initially refused, but was forced to comply. The Japanese side also said that all personnel used by Zhang Zuoxiang must be dismissed or replaced by appropriate personnel according to the wishes of the military. Xi also expressed difficulty towards the North, but had to comply in the end. As a result, the leaders of various agencies were changed one after another. The most surprising thing was that the position of Director-General of the Official Silver Bank was changed to Liu Xifen, a Japanese pawn with low character. Liu was from Shulan County, Jilin. He had studied in Japan and served as a liaison officer and translator for the foreign affairs office of the provincial government. After the Japanese army arrived in Jilin, Xi, in order to curry favor with the Japanese side, promoted him to Director of the Liaison Office to facilitate the reception of the Japanese army. Liu usually relied on the power of the Japanese to do all kinds of evil, and his lust was particularly deep. His depravity was well-known, and even fair-minded Japanese people despised him. After the Japanese army arrived in Jilin, Liu mediated between Xi Qia and Domen, transmitting messages. All the secrets of both sides were known to him. Liu then used this to control Xi, repeatedly indicating to Xi that he wanted the lucrative position of the Official Silver Bank. Since the Japanese side had already recommended him, Xi dared not go against their wishes and appointed him as Director-General. Xi Qia's appointment as the head of Jilin was due to the coercion of the Japanese side. Xi himself believed that this move would undermine the Republic of China and have the suspicion of being a "puppet emperor". Therefore, he called together representatives of legal entities to discuss how to generate support, and adopted the opinion of Hou, taking the form of endorsement from all sectors to justify himself. The Japanese side also understood this intention, so a section chief in attendance wrote a letter of persuasion. Xi then declared his acceptance of the position of head with the ugly words "There is no escape from duty, righteousness does not allow for resignation, and I obey the will of the people to reluctantly shoulder the heavy burden." The next day, Xie Guanglin, the head of the Farmers' Association who was listed as a persuader, was appointed as an advisor to the Chief Executive's Office. Jiang Chongde, the head of the Trade Union, was appointed as the Director of the Provincial Tax Bureau. Zhang Songling, the head of the Chamber of Commerce, was appointed as the Director of the Stamp Tax Office. Zhang Shushan, the head of the Education Association, was appointed as the Magistrate of Emu County. Ye Kuiyi, the Trade Union employee, also got a seat as a secretary in the Chief Executive's Office due to his hard work.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>At first, Xi Qia was extremely frustrated by the Japanese army, but seeing that the overall situation was stable and the power was in his hands (in reality, he was a puppet), he changed from a committee system to a dictatorship. The so-called chief executive was quite similar to the governors of the late Qing Dynasty, with full control over the military and civilian affairs of the province and concurrently managing the judiciary. He then forgot his original position and his great shame, and became complacent, issuing orders. On the one hand, he was afraid of displeasing the Japanese army, as his position would be unstable. Therefore, he secretly discussed with Liu Xifen, the newly appointed Director-General of the Official Silver Bank, and proposed that the provincial treasury provide 500,000 Jilin silver dollars to reward the Japanese army. He also sent a letter to "General Honjo Shigeru, Commander of the Great Japanese Kwantung Army". The letter began with the salutation "To General Honjo," and stated that the Japanese army was civilized, committing no offenses, and the people of Jilin were grateful and had nothing to repay. He respectfully presented 500,000 Jilin silver dollars on behalf of the people of Jilin to express their condolences. The letter also expressed the hope for the Japanese army's care and so on. Xi and Liu personally delivered the cash to the Japanese side. Their baseness and shamelessness were appalling. Xi Qia also felt that since he had taken Zhang Zuoxiang's position and replaced him, and had dismissed his former colleagues and replaced them with his own people, it was too disrespectful to Zuoxiang. Therefore, he sent his personal representative to Shanhaiguan to explain his difficulties and hope for Zhang Zuoxiang's understanding. In fact, personal power and private friendships are both irrelevant. What is regrettable is that Jilin is a province of the Republic of China, under the jurisdiction of the National Government. Xi should have died to protect unity. Instead, he was first threatened and then lured, accepting this false position and acting as the second Zhang Bangchang. Now that the Japanese side has achieved its initial goal, the only thing left is to figure out how to use the pro-Japanese Chinese, how to buy people's hearts, and how to numb the masses so that they will submit. When the pro-Japanese elements are spread throughout the province and the map changes color, then they will achieve their second step. The above-mentioned 500,000 yuan in consolation money is only a small matter. After the Japanese army arrived in Jilin, Honjo sent an accounting officer from Shenyang to Jilin to conduct a thorough investigation of the detailed situation of the financial institutions in Jilin. He also explained to the authorities that in the future, Jilin Province only needs a self-defense police force to maintain security and does not need to keep useless national defense forces. In this way, the annual military expenditure can be reduced by 10 million yuan (currently, Jilin's military expenditure accounts for 85% of its revenue). Later, he requested Rong Hou, the former Director of Finance, to allocate a subsidy of 200,000 Japanese yen per month to the Japanese army. Rong refused. This time, Sun Qichang succeeded Rong as Director of Finance at the request of the Japanese side, so it is undoubtedly a conditional exchange. Sun's pro-Japanese color is strong. On the 23rd, when Xi Qia was ordered by the Japanese army to reorganize the independent government, Sun was the first to agree and sign on the provincial committee. Therefore, there is no doubt that Sun will be a Japanese lackey in the future, taking whatever they want and fulfilling their desires. The people of Jilin are in fact equal to the people of a conquered nation. I don't know what people inside Shanhaiguan think of them. (October 7)</p>
<h3>Jilin</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Still Has Over a Brigade</p>
<p>The False Chief Executive's Office Flies the Japanese Flag</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Hates the Kuomintang the Most</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: According to a person who came from Jilin Province on the 2nd, the Japanese troops in Liaoning and Jilin have not withdrawn. The troops in Jilin and Changchun have been changed frequently. There are still hundreds of cavalry and infantry patrolling Jilin City. Each person has a steel helmet and a military cap. They change every time they pass a street. Gunshots are heard every night in the east and west gates of Jilin City. Although the false Chief Executive's Office was reorganized and established by the provincial government, the security of the entire city is still in the hands of the Japanese. To this day, only Xi Qia is allowed to recruit guards. Dozens of Japanese troops live inside the false Chief Executive's Office. A Japanese flag is hoisted high above the entrance. When Xi Qia moves, he is always accompanied by Japanese troops. Every Chinese policeman in the city has a white cloth circle on his arm with the words "District X, Team X" written on it, and stamped with the red square seal of "Commander of the Garrison, Colonel Tsuboi". All official and gentry vehicles have been requisitioned. Telephone lines to the various counties in the four countryside areas are still not open. There is not a single Japanese soldier withdrawn from Dunhua, which is even more serious than Jilin City. The Japanese troops stationed in Jilin total over a brigade, including the 30th and 16th Infantry Regiments, a large company of military police, a team of machine guns, a team of field artillery, and a team of guards. The volunteer corps and reserve teams of residents are not included. Most of the military supplies originally in Jilin Province have been transported away or stored in Japanese military camps, and the rest have been destroyed. The Japanese have taken out the funds stored in the provincial treasury, 2 million Japanese yen the first time, and 500,000 Japanese yen the second time, without giving receipts and without allowing them to be announced. The old military officer training center is occupied by the Japanese military police, and a sign is prominently displayed at the entrance: "Japanese Jilin Military Police". In the original list of new officials in the Jilin Provincial Government, Jin Bidong, the son of Prince Su of the former Qing Dynasty, is the Director of the Jichang and Jidun Railway Bureaus and concurrently the Mayor of Changchun, but he has not yet been formally announced. The Japanese person, Minetori Yoshi, has lived in Jilin for more than 20 years. He once served as a teacher at the Provincial First Normal School. He now sits at home and uses the phone to ask the school every day, "Are classes open?" He is truly a Supreme Education Director. The market is extremely chaotic. Although the theaters are still operating as usual, their income has been sharply reduced. They have now changed to opening at 9:00 AM and resting at 2:00 PM for an early show, and the evening show runs from 2:30 PM to 6:00 PM. Because the Jilin-Changchun Daily is subject to strict censorship and the mail is slow, it has announced that it has been changed to a large daily newspaper, and the news coverage has been minimized. Domestic news is almost impossible to see again. The Japanese army hates the three words "Kuomintang" the most. After arriving in Jilin, in addition to occupying the provincial party headquarters, they also searched and arrested the members of the party headquarters. Committee Member Han Jiesheng was detained in the People's Association and severely tortured. He has already died tragically. When Xi Qia took the false position the other day, the Japanese army commander supervised and said that the government was of an independent nature and was not allowed to hang the blue and white national flag. The party flag was even more strictly forbidden. Currently, the portraits of the Founder of the Party in the classrooms of various schools have been removed, and the textbooks on the Three Principles of the People and Party principles are also not dared to be taught. Those who have this book in their homes have already burned them for fear of searches. (October 6)</p>
<h3>Reporter Delegation</h3>
<p>Entertaining European and American Reporters in Beiping</p>
<p>Report on the Incident in Dong Province, Hoping for Factual Coverage</p>
<p>The Beiping News Reporters Association hosted European and American reporters stationed in Beiping at the Shuixie Pavilion in Zhongshan Park at 4:00 PM today, the 6th. Those present included Tian Boli, the Beiping correspondent for The Times of London; Hong De, the Beiping correspondent for the New York Sun; Hall of the English-language "China Press"; and Sili Bake, correspondent and representative of the Soviet Telegraph Agency. Feng Zikun, Li Bingrui, Sun Ruiqin, Yin Siqi, and Cheng Shewo served as the presidium. Seventy-eight Chinese reporters attended. After an opening speech by Cheng Shewo, Tian Boli, the China correspondent for The Times of London, delivered a speech, which was translated by Feng Zikun. In brief, Mr. Tian said he was very honored to attend the meeting. Regarding the current situation, European and American reporters, standing from a neutral position, cannot be biased. If Japanese reporters were to invite them tomorrow, they would also have to attend. Therefore, they would only listen to both sides' opinions, and anything else would be beyond their authority. Regarding the responsibilities of news reporters, if an event occurs, they can only report the facts and cannot add any personal opinions. His participation today was in a personal capacity and did not represent any organization. I have only provided an abstract translation and have not been able to fully convey Mr. Tian's meaning. I apologize to Mr. Tian for this. Next, Hall of the English-language "China Press" delivered a speech, which was again translated by Feng Zikun. In brief, Mr. Hall's words were extremely fair and sympathetic. We thank him first. He said he had personally visited Shenyang and met with various consuls. When meeting with the Japanese consul, they all claimed that the Chinese had demolished the train station, but investigations could not prove this. On September 19th, when the Japanese invaded Shenyang, the telegrams from European and American reporters had not yet arrived, but the Japanese telegrams had arrived first. After the news spread, European and American newspapers had already made comments. This telegram that arrived first was naturally from the Japanese. But why is China, with its vast resources and large population, subjected to such humiliation? A month ago, the Japanese had not yet invaded Dong Province because they saw China's internal wars. Were they about to brew another one? If internal wars occur, foreign aggression will follow. Therefore, the crisis is looming larger every day. It's like a match factory. Other countries avoid using toxic substances when building match factories for fear of harming workers, but China has such factories and does not notice. Some young children have died from poisoning. Mr. Hall's sympathetic words are indeed a faithful lesson for us. Next, Hong De, the Beiping correspondent for the New York Sun, delivered a speech, also translated by Feng Zikun. In brief, Mr. Hong said that he had worked for a newspaper in Hankou a few years ago, when the Sino-Japanese Shandong Problem occurred. He took his business card to the garrison commander's office to inquire, but the person who received him said he didn't know or that there was no such thing. He also asked if there were any cases in Jinan, and the person who received him replied that he was not authorized to tell him because there were no orders, or perhaps there was no such thing. Chinese institutions are too secretive. He had no choice but to inquire at the Japanese consulate, which revealed everything, but the content was one-sided. Because Chinese institutions are too secretive, he had to use the Japanese consulate's information as material, without knowing whether the news was true or one-sided. Now that there is the League of Nations, although it has no power, it can still publish the facts of an event. Overall, we can say that journalism is gradually getting on track. Next, Sili Bake, correspondent and representative of the Soviet Telegraph Agency, delivered a speech, translated by Sun Ruiqin. In brief, Mr. Keli Bake was initially unwilling to speak, but later I persuaded him, and he spoke reluctantly. He said that because he represented the Russian news agency, he was concerned about being inconvenienced. He said that whenever an event occurs, news reporters can only report the facts and should not add personal opinions, but they cannot avoid adding some personal opinions. Russia's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese issue is very clear in the newspapers, so there is no need to say more. China should not ask British imperialism and the League of Nations to help when fighting Japanese imperialism, or ask Japanese imperialism to help when fighting British imperialism. It is better to help oneself. In the Manchurian Incident, justice is on China's side. Therefore, China today can only rely on itself. Finally, Yin Siqi gave a response, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Attached is the declaration of the Beiping Reporters Association: The Beiping News Reporters Association of the Republic of China, regarding the atrocities of the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces, respectfully and sincerely declares to the citizens and governments of our friendly nations as follows: For the past twenty years, China has been in a process of revolution. Although it has not been able to quickly achieve its revolutionary goals, so that China can stand on equal footing with the friendly nations of the world in freedom and equality, all Chinese citizens with a revolutionary consciousness are striving towards this goal. There have been setbacks in between, but the main reasons are two: one is the existence of domestic reactionary forces, and the other is the oppression of foreign political forces. China's frequent internal strife has always involved the direct or indirect participation of foreign forces, especially Japan. There is no need to list the facts. Any fair-minded person from a friendly nation who knows a little about China's political situation will understand this.</p>
<p>This year, the Chinese government is making efforts to suppress the communist bandits in Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Fujian provinces. Moreover, there have been floods, with more than 50 million victims. The citizens of our friendly nations have all expressed their deep sympathy and generously provided relief. However, the Japanese army, taking advantage of the situation, suddenly took free action in Shenyang on the night of September 18th, completely occupying Shenyang. Chinese administrative organs, financial organs, and transportation organs were all sealed off, burned, or taken over by Japanese people. Since then, they have continued to occupy important cities in Manchuria, now reaching more than thirty places. China's political sovereignty in Manchuria has been completely destroyed. The anger of the Chinese people has reached its extreme. However, the government is advocating retreat and trying to maintain order. The beating of Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting in Nanjing on September 28th is enough to prove that the anger of the Chinese people has reached the final limit of being unbearable.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a major crisis looming before us, that is, looming before all people in the world. What is this crisis? It is the complete communization or great chaos of China.</p>
<p>Chinese farmers account for more than 80% of the total population. Together with workers, they account for 80% to 90% of the total population. There are currently more than 50 million flood victims in China's flood-stricken areas, almost all of whom are farmers and workers. In Manchuria, due to the Japanese army's atrocities, the number of unemployed farmers and workers will reach more than 10 million. These more than 60 million farmers and workers have no clothes and no food. According to Chinese history, there is at least one major peasant revolt every few years. The Taiping Rebellion is one example. If there had been no Manchurian Incident by the Japanese army, the Chinese government would have been working to use the surplus grain from Manchuria to provide relief to the flood victims, and to move the flood victims to Manchuria for reclamation. Now, due to the Japanese army's atrocities, not only has the livelihood of the flood victims in China's flood-stricken areas been completely cut off, but also more than 10 million flood victims have been added for no reason. These more than 60 million flood victims with no clothes and no food are enough to cause a major crisis in China. More than 300 million farmers and workers sympathize with them. The degree of danger is self-evident. Moreover, the Communist Party is carrying out planned and organized activities in China, which is also an undeniable fact. The Noulens case recently discovered in Shanghai is one proof. Then, China now has more than 60 million farmers and workers who can create chaos, and more than 300 million sympathize with them. This is more serious than the unemployment problem in any country. Added to this is the activities of the Communist Party and the unstoppable anger of the people across the country at the Japanese army's atrocities, then the outbreak of great chaos is inevitable. We are not using this to threaten the world, nor are we using this to beg for the world's assistance. We are declaring that the impact of the great chaos that will occur in all of China in the future will be to shake the peace in the Far East, to destroy the Far East market, and its repercussions will inevitably extend to India, the Straits Settlements, and even the Philippines. These responsibilities should be borne entirely by the Japanese military. We are only predicting this inevitable result.</p>
<h3>15th Plenary Meeting of the National Government</h3>
<p>The National Government held its 15th Plenary Meeting on the 9th. The committee members present were Chen Guofu, Wang Boqun, Ma Fuxiang, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Ding Weifen, Shao Yuanchong, Dai Chuanxian, Shao Lizi, and Kong Xiangxi. Yu Youren chaired the meeting. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) It was resolved to appoint Zhang Weihan, Wang Boling, Hu Shuhua, Nan Guiyin, Huang Xuyi, Dong Xiujia, Zhao Naichuan, Wang Boqiu, Cheng Zhongxing, Di Ying, Nuonahu Tukehui, He Sui, Ling Sheng, and Guanglu as members of the Legislative Yuan. (2) It was resolved to promulgate the Organizational Law of the Mongolian League and Banner. (3) It was resolved to promulgate the Short-Term Public Debt Regulations for the Jiangsu Canal Project in the 20th year of the Republic of China. (4) It was resolved to promulgate the General Budget of Revenue and Expenditure for Dong Province in the 20th year of the Republic of China. (5) The Executive Yuan submitted that, according to a telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the "Qingxiang" (purification of the countryside) in several counties in Zhejiang Province has not been completed as scheduled, and it is proposed to extend the application period of the "Qingxiang" regulations so as to achieve complete success. It is proposed to approve a further extension of four months, until the end of December of this year, and to approve that no special bureau will be set up separately, and the Civil Affairs Department of the province and the county governments of each county will continue to be responsible for handling it. Is this appropriate? The reasoned document is submitted to the court for review and approval. It was resolved to approve it. (6) The Huai River Conservancy Committee presented that, upon investigation, the original plan for the Huai River Conservancy project was to divert the river into the Yangtze River and the sea. The plan for diverting the Huai River into the Yangtze River has been submitted to the court for approval and filing. Now, since the summer, the Yangtze and Huai rivers have both risen, and the harm of floods has spread throughout Huaicheng. Opening up a waterway into the sea is also an urgent matter. The 12th plenary meeting of the committee decided to adopt the route from the Zhangfu River to the abandoned Yellow River to Taozikou as the route for diverting the Huai River into the sea. The entire route is 17,197 kilometers long, and the total cost is 34,269,100 yuan. A summary of the plan for diverting the Huai River into the sea is enclosed, and the court is requested to review and file it. It was resolved to approve the filing. (7) The Control Yuan impeached Cao Boque, the magistrate of Zhenhai County, Hu Jiajun, the trial official, and Li Jingda, the village chief, and requested that they be handed over for punishment. It was resolved to exempt Cao Boquan from punishment, dismiss Hu Jiajun from his post and suspend his appointment, and hand Li Jingda over to the court for interrogation and judgment, and handle it separately.</p>

<p>Local Correspondence Two</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The County Party Department presented that the County Magistrate Chen Chuande of this county has suppressed public opinion, obstructed progress, and did not attend the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation People's Congress in the current anti-Japanese and national salvation work. The matter was presented to the Provincial Party Department and forwarded to the Provincial Government for prompt removal and punishment. County Magistrate Chen specially sent a letter to the County Party Department's Executive Li Tiping to state his position on the matter. His letter stated that the People's Congress suppressed public opinion and that not a single government staff member attended the meeting. It was recalled that when the government held a discussion meeting, Comrade Nian Qian proposed that the popular will should be promoted and that the People's Congress should be held. He said that it was necessary to express public opinion, but that this county is the center of Beijing and Shanghai, with factories everywhere and people from all walks of life. We must pay special attention to local order. Comrade Nian Qian and Comrade Jun Yi and all of you present heard these words. I was supposed to attend the People's Congress because of my duties, but I also sent Section Chief Zhou Chengzhong and Section Member Han Wei to participate. There is an attendance book to check. Moreover, the security arrangements near the venue and along the road were arranged by me. Therefore, although there were many people, fortunately, nothing happened and we provided comprehensive protection. How can it be said that I suppressed public opinion? The facts are all there and cannot be erased. Because I think you are the chairman of the Congress, I dare to send a letter to you to find out the truth. At this time of national crisis, it is time for our Party and government personnel to unite sincerely to seek survival and avenge our humiliation. We must work together in the same boat. I think we all have empathy. The Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association was ordered to reorganize. The Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association of all circles in this county was yesterday instructed by the County Party Department to reorganize in accordance with the organizational outline issued by the Provincial Executive Committee. In addition to the representatives of the original groups, Zhao Zixin, Xie Bin, Ji Pu, Li Lianzheng, Wei Zhiwen, Shi Qinglin and others were designated to participate in various people's groups, and all people's groups were notified. It was also heard that Zhang Renjie, a member of the Provincial Party Department's Executive Committee, was dispatched to Wuxi to guide and preside over the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Movement. The Anti-Japanese Association's inspection team yesterday found enemy goods in the Qiuxin Company at the entrance of the Shuyuan Lane in the city. Because the company repeatedly sold enemy goods, the manager Yang Hanyun was sent to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention and was scheduled to stand in a wooden cage and parade through the streets to warn the public. The Xinxin Store in Chong'an Temple also found enemy goods. The store manager Jiang Xikang was sent to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention, awaiting punishment.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Tianfengtai's Japanese Goods Greatly Criticized</p>
<p>Twenty-five pieces of Japanese goods were previously found at the Benniu Station in Wu County. The Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association has now found that they were privately imported by Tianfengtai in the city. This store has always been a large store, but it has done such a conscience-stricken thing. Therefore, it has been greatly criticized by all circles. On the afternoon of the 8th, the Changzhou County Middle School Student Union petitioned the County Party Department that Tianfengtai should be severely punished. The middle school student unions also held an emergency meeting on the 9th. The First District Party Department also resolved to present a petition to the County Party Department to have the owner of Tianfengtai stand in a wooden model, be fined, and have the Japanese goods burned to warn others. Tian Yiqin of the Chamber of Commerce also requested that Chairman Guo Cifen convene a temporary meeting of member representatives to punish the traitors.</p>
<p>Canal Settlement Cannot Be Resolved</p>
<p>The contractor of the Wu County Canal Dredging Project requested a settlement of construction costs. Representatives of various agencies mediated at the Chamber of Commerce on the 8th, and the result was that the County Party Department, the County Government, and the Construction Bureau would discuss the matter. In addition to the settlement by the Compensation Committee, an additional 4,000 yuan was to be paid. However, the contractor stated that the matter could not be resolved unless 25,000 yuan was paid. At that time, it could not be resolved, and it was decided to present it to the Construction Department for approval.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Student Volunteers Established</p>
<p>Students from secondary schools and above in Nantong, indignant at the Japanese brutality, specially formed a volunteer army. A military committee was set up by each training group. A swearing-in ceremony was held at Tongzhong on the 9th. Each team is undergoing rigorous training every day.</p>
<p>The Entire County's Business Community Vigorously Implements Anti-Japanese Actions</p>
<p>Representatives of all industries in the county have now sworn never to sell Japanese goods. All export raw materials in this county will not be sold to Japanese people. Imported Japanese goods will be burned immediately upon discovery. Businesses in various industries are implementing military training. A Merchant Military Training Committee has been established in the Chamber of Commerce, and people with military knowledge have been hired as instructors. On the 7th, all commercial organizations notified the ports and boatmen along the river that all Japanese merchant ships passing through would not be allowed to row boats to pick up passengers and goods.</p>
<p>British Ship Passing Through, Misunderstanding with Garrison</p>
<p>At about 2:00 PM on the 8th, a British ship sailed from Xinsheng Port to Shanghai and berthed at the port while passing through. It launched a boat to go ashore. Because the ship had no flags, the garrison prevented the boat from approaching the shore and fired a warning shot. The boat turned back. The ship raised the British flag. Both sides explained the misunderstanding. The ship raised its anchor and sailed away.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of the Burning of Opium Case in the Court</p>
<p>The Nantong County Court burned opium and discovered 14.5 catties of counterfeit opium and more than 1,000 taels of opium were missing. Yu Zongjian, a member of the burning supervision committee, presented it to the High Court for review. On the 8th, President Lin ordered the Nantong County Court Procuratorate to thoroughly investigate. Chief Prosecutor Liu specially summoned Wu Tingjie and three others involved in the case for interrogation, but there were no results yet.</p>
<p>Fumin Port Police and Bandits Fiercely Fight</p>
<p>On the evening of the 7th, many bandit ships arrived at Fumin Port. The Public Security Bureau learned of this and sent Special Police Captain Qin Kunshan to lead a team to intercept them. Both sides opened fire. The bandits were unable to resist and retreated, abandoning a bandit ship. There were three male and female hostages on the ship. The male hostage was Sun Anci, from Taicang, and the female hostages were Xu Ma's and a Miss Wu. They were temporarily detained by the Public Security Bureau. The police also seized two rifles and two pistols.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Japanese Warships Rotate Garrison in Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The Japanese warship "Atami," which was stationed in Zhenjiang, was small. Yesterday, it suddenly received orders to sail to Shanghai, and a larger warship, "Hojin Maru," was sent to berth outside the Osaka lighter. Captain Kuwaryo So met with Chen Fu, the director of the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital, and stated that he would not allow his troops to land and asked not to be misunderstood.</p>
<p>The Principal Culprit in the Zhufang Ferry Case Arrested</p>
<p>The people of Yangzi Bridge burned the Zhufang ferry of the Fuhua Ferry Company. The Jiangdu County Government arrested several accomplices and interrogated them. They confessed that Yu Xiaoshunzi was the leader. Magistrate Chen immediately ordered the strict arrest. The county's detective team learned that Yu was hiding in this port. Detective Wang Junqing was dispatched to Zhenjiang to find Yu at the Xinquan Bathhouse in the city and took him to the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. The bureau sent police to escort Yu back to Jiangdu for trial yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Scheduled Restoration of Inland Ferry Services</p>
<p>Inland ferry services have not been restored since the flood. Although Zhentai and Zhenyou have been opened in order, the times are often inaccurate. Now the Dada Yangtong, Zhentai, Taichang Daishengchang, Tiantai, and Xiehe Nanjing ferries, and the Fuyun Tiantai Litong Daishengchang Zhenqing ferries will resume their original schedule from the 11th. In addition to the Chenjiayang Tongyang Tianchang ferry, public tickets are sold on all ferries.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Automatically Inspects Goods</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various trade associations on the 7th. Chairman Wang Jingting presided over the meeting to discuss anti-Japanese and national salvation work. The business community should carry out the work thoroughly. It was resolved to monitor each other and not import Japanese goods. When purchasing goods, each merchant should first open a list and report it to the industry association. After the association reviews it, it will send someone to purchase and transport the goods. When the goods arrive at the port, they should be reported to the Chamber of Commerce for review, and then the Anti-Japanese Association should be asked to identify them.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau to Implement Military Training</p>
<p>At the police affairs meeting held yesterday, Director Mao proposed that because the violent Japanese are forcibly occupying Dong Province and massacring our compatriots, the country will be destroyed soon. Military force is the only way to resist Japan and save the country. Therefore, in addition to intensifying the military education of the long-term police officers under our command, all staff members should also receive military training in preparation for the future. The regulations and implementing rules of the corps were drafted by Chief Inspector Ding and Patrol Captain Wang and submitted for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Provincial Security Team Suppresses Taizhou Bandits in Fenghua</p>
<p>The mountains in the Dayao and Xiyao areas of the Yuanyuan District of Fenghua are rugged, and bandits come and go unpredictably. After the Shengxin and Feng counties joined forces to suppress them, the momentum has been slightly curbed. Later, because the security team stationed there was ordered to concentrate on training and leave Fenghua, bandits caused great disturbances, and cases of kidnapping and looting occurred several times a day. The county magistrate has telegraphed the Sixth Regiment of Baiguan, requesting them to send troops to suppress them. At the same time, he ordered the First Battalion stationed in Xinchang to assist in the joint suppression, in order to eliminate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Merging Money Shops in Same Trade</p>
<p>After the Yin County Party Department and the County Government instructed to merge the large and small money shops in Ningbo, the two associations stated that the business nature was different and the capital size was different, making it difficult to merge. They have stated three reasons to the County Executive Committee and the County Government that they have to be organized separately, otherwise, forced mergers will inevitably cause disputes in remittance transfers. The County Executive Committee and the County Government have not yet approved it, so it is specially recorded.</p>
<h3>Two Major Ways Out for China in the Future</h3>
<p>丨Written for the National Day Anniversary丨 (Zhang Yuanruo)</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow. The state of the nation is ever-changing. Seasons come and go, and another Double Tenth Festival arrives. Reflecting on the past twenty years, there has hardly been a moment without worry and hardship. Lives have been devastated, the hearts of the people have been disturbed, the land has been fragmented, and the nation has tottered. Our nation, traditionally rich in the characteristics of peace and the way of benevolent governance, truly does not know what sins it has committed to suffer such a great calamity and enact such a tragic drama. The raging tide of global science and culture is advancing like a swift wind and flashing lightning amidst an atmosphere of prosperity and joy, while our aging and suffering nation is still groaning and struggling helplessly in the predicament of continuous war. Every time a festive occasion arrives, the sense of sorrow only deepens. Looking at the present and recalling the past, what facts are there to celebrate? What can restrain the sorrow in our hearts? Looking around at the global situation and anticipating the great difficulties to come, one cannot help but shudder. The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual. The author, not ashamed of the shallowness of his personal knowledge and the weakness of his abilities, with a sincere heart, is always concerned about the life of the nation and deeply worried about the downfall of the country. He firmly believes that our lives and our happiness must be entrusted and enhanced through the revival and development of the entire nation. He has often quietly studied the ways to reverse the chaos and restore order, and the plans for long-term peace and stability. Everything that can benefit our country, bless our society, and benefit our people, he has made the utmost sincere effort to contribute, even if it is only a drop in the ocean. Today, as the whole country celebrates together and the entire nation forces a smile, worries and anxieties flood in, and he cannot restrain himself. Therefore, he hastily writes this article to express his feelings. If the people of the nation do not dismiss his words because of his insignificance, and do not ignore his intention because of the clumsiness of his language, and also do not underestimate the power of individual efforts for society and the nation, but rise up vigorously to turn the tide of the declining situation and open up the vitality of the nation, then when I put pen to paper, I will be overwhelmed with hope and celebrate.</p>
<p>When Mr. Sun Yat-sen was on his deathbed, in his last moments, he made his final call, "Peace, struggle... save China." At this moment of delirium and confusion, his spirit was still focused on our precarious nation and our suffering people. This last moment of outcry contains immeasurable fervent and profound meaning. We, his followers and comrades who live on, if our faith has not been lost and our conscience still exists, when we quietly reflect in the deep of night, we should feel such grief and think about how to strive forward. But looking at the phenomenon of today, when it comes to peace, various parties compete for power and position, fight for territory, and engage in factional disputes over personal feelings. When it comes to struggle, various parties consider grand mansions and automobiles as honor, and regard a life of luxury and dissipation as paradise, indulging in extravagance and wanton desires as the fashion. Whether in or out of government, in politics or in parties, in the military or in officialdom, in business or in academia, none can deny the existence of this phenomenon. Born in adversity, but sinking into comfort and pleasure, the nation will perish any day now. What is there to celebrate? The people have been weary of war for a long time. Our people have suffered in battle for a long time. The people of the entire country, whether they are landowners, farmers, workers, or merchants, except for a few who stir up trouble and rejoice in calamity, who in the entire country does not eagerly desire peace and earnestly seek strength? But why is it that this common and widespread social sentiment has always been suppressed and sunk, unable to be transformed into social power? This is because the socially enlightened are unable to take advantage of the situation and guide it, creating a powerful and vigorous momentum. And the general public, seeing the futility of individual sighs, therefore belittle themselves, gradually developing a spirit of listlessness and decadence, ultimately allowing the forces of evil to surpass the forces of good by a thousandfold. When disaster strikes, there is nothing to be done. This is why the people suffer in battle, and battles always follow one after another, and the people are tired of war, but the chaos continues unabated.</p>
<p>Those who speak of national affairs today almost all recognize peace as the only way out for saving the country at present. Therefore, when I first returned to my motherland, I advocated the theory of saving the country through peace, loudly calling out, "With peace, there is nothing that cannot be done. Without peace, nothing can be saved." In principle of sociology, peace is the foundation of social evolution. During this revolutionary construction period, if one wants to make a fresh start with the people, let them rest and recuperate, and let them thrive, then the only and initial condition is the foundation of peace. With the foundation of peace, one can quietly seek a comprehensive construction plan, one can remove obstacles to the construction process, one can steadily ensure the benefits of construction... Only peace can restore the nation's vitality, only peace can cultivate the nation's vitality, only peace can improve the people's lives. Therefore, peace is the foundation of construction, the starting point of governance, and the dawn of happiness for our people.</p>
<p>However, this is an old refrain, and people are tired of hearing it. We people are praying and yearning for the coming of peace day and night. But why is it so difficult to realize? I once said that this is due to the lack of strong, unified, and sound public opinion, and therefore the lack of the power to sanction those who disturb and harm peace. However, this meaning is still not exhausted. All things in the universe must have their principles. "Those who uphold unity are governed, those who uphold division are in chaos." (Words from Lord Shang) Before the Republic of China, the world was defined by one supreme authority, and the people were content with the five constant virtues. After the revolution, the government lost its center, and the masses had no master. The puppet of governance by man has been lost, and the spirit of governance by law has not been established. Although the obstacles of the old times have been removed, the new systems that replace them have not been established. What is new? The new masses have no clear impression, and even more so have no unified understanding. The ignorant masses only seek the new, but the new is ultimately unattainable, empty and devoid of anything. It is fitting that the spiritual world is in great chaos, right and wrong are indistinguishable, obedience and rebellion are indistinguishable, fathers have no way to teach their sons, brothers have no way to instruct their younger brothers, the government has no way to benefit the people, and the people have no way to supervise the government. The old and the new do not connect, and the wheels of the carts run in opposite directions. An atmosphere of depression and despair fills the world. In addition, Western culture has gradually spread eastward, and human desires are rampant. However, our country's economic situation is still stagnant in the medieval handicraft era, unable to keep pace with the rampant human desires and make proportional progress. Especially because the people of the country are naive and do not understand the true meaning of material civilization, in the use of material goods and the economy, not in material enjoyment and waste, they are fickle and only admire the lazy customs of the Western tourist class. Western decadence has made the social customs of the people increasingly extravagant. The degree of entertainment and consumption of the people of the country is probably more than double that of the men and women of Paris and New York, while their ability to endure hardship and produce is not only less than one ten-thousandth of that of Westerners, but also far inferior to that of our country's ancestors. The ability to produce has decreased sharply, while the desire to consume has increased dramatically. Everyone only takes acquisition as their goal, not service as their vocation. Born in adversity, they are quick to seek comfort and pleasure. Living in poverty, they admire luxury. The result is that the sources of livelihood are not revitalized, the vitality is greatly damaged, supply and demand do not meet, and factional disputes become more intense. The material happiness that ordinary workers in Europe and America can enjoy is still dreamed of by the upper class of our country day and night, but cannot be obtained. The rampant flow of desires is as such, and the poverty of material goods is also such. Once the price mechanism is triggered, the entire country will be in chaos.</p>
<p>We people must fundamentally realize that the China of today has two major basic needs. One, in terms of society, we must strive to cultivate the foundation of the rule of law. Two, in terms of material goods, we must strive for economic construction. (1) The spirit of the rule of law lies in fairness and justice. Once all standards are based on the law, everything will return to unity. Only in this way can we prevent the tyranny of power and protect the development of civil rights. And all the people can obtain norms of behavior and principles of coexistence. What should be explained here is that what I mean by the rule of law is not merely compiling legal codes on white paper in black and white, but especially emphasizing the protection of the law, the compliance with the law, and the implementation of the law. The law is not only to control people, but those who govern must also be bound by the law. All those who usurp power and act perversely must be quickly eliminated. On this point, I have already discussed it in other articles, so I will not repeat it here. (2) As for economic construction, it is even more urgent to plan for it. Does China today still have any slight chance of revitalizing its economy? Farmers are neglecting their fields, workers are lazy in their factories, merchants are declining in the markets, and scholars are abandoning their studies. This is already the case. And the result of the stagnation of national production has also created great poverty in all social classes. Famine occurs year after year, and desolation fills the eye. The people are even fighting for tree bark and grass roots to barely prolong their lives. In this extremely tragic and desolate predicament, we can only use the greatest confidence, the greatest perseverance, and the greatest courage to strive for the development of the national economy. If we people have a shred of energy and a spark of wisdom, we should first use it for national production, and never misuse it for meaningless factional disputes or meaningless destruction. Be moved in mind and patient in nature, with unwavering sincerity, jointly shoulder the great responsibility of construction, and jointly seek the prosperity of construction. Construction work, although extremely difficult, especially given the vast territory of our country and the multitude of problems, continuing the past and opening up the future, its responsibility is heavier and its path is longer. However, we people only need to have the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains and the mentality of crossing a river in the same boat. Then, building one part is succeeding one part. If we build one day and destroy it ten days, if one person builds and ten people destroy, even Europe and America, which are thriving, prosperous, and militarily strong, can be overwhelmed and unable to survive. Then how can our nation, which is already full of holes and exhausted, withstand such a blow and maintain its remaining life? As for talking about saving the country and securing the people, it will be even more like turning the cart around and heading north. The world is in difficult times, the people are suffering, and the country is in danger. It has reached this extreme. We who are born in troubled times only have one heart and one mind, only with sincerity and only with truth, at any time and in any place, jointly plan for the construction of the nation and jointly seek the revival of the nation. Strive to do our best, and let everything, great and small, benefit the people. Sacrifice each according to his sincerity, and do not take credit for oneself when success is achieved. Know that the suffering of the nation is our suffering, the peril of the nation is our peril, and the development of the nation is our development, the rights of the nation are our rights, and the happiness of civil rights is our happiness. Order and chaos, peace and danger, survival and extinction, rise and fall, all depend on our present moment of awakening. The whole country is drowsy. Readers, will you not consider my words to be pedantic and impractical? Keep this in mind and please put it into practice and verify it.</p>

<h3>Charity Ball Today Semifinals</h3>
<p>Lin and Qiu Will Have a Great Battle</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results...</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Won Three Straight Against Gao Huimin</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang Won Three Straight Against Yang Lunzhang</p>
<p>丨Malaysian Doubles Occupied Advantage丨</p>
<p>丨Lin Wangsu Showed Some Skill丨</p>
<p>The charity tennis tournament, which brought together national tennis masters, opened at the Chinese Tennis Court at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. The autumn wind was strong, and there were quite a few people sitting precariously. The results of the first round of the singles preliminary were that Qiu Feihai won against Gao Huimin 9-7, 6-2, 6-3. Jiang Daozhang won against Yang Lunzhang 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. In the first week of doubles, Malaysia occupied a favorable position against Tianjin. Today, in the singles semifinals, Lin Baohua will fight against Qiu Feihai starting at 2:30 p.m. At the same time, Lin Wangsu will fight against Jiang Daozhang to win the final. The doubles will continue the unfinished match between Malaysia and Tianjin.</p>
<p>Six Heroes of Chinese Tennis</p>
<p>(Top) Jiang Daozhang, Gao Huimin, Qiu Feihai (Bottom) Lin Baohua, Lin Wangsu, Yang Lunzhang (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Defeated Gao Huimin</p>
<p>Nine to Seven</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Six to Two Gao Huimin</p>
<p>Six to Three</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Persevered and Overcame the Enemy In the battle between Qiu and Gao, the first set was the most intense, with a total of sixteen games before the winner was decided. Both sides were in a precarious position. Gao Huimin, seeing that Qiu's cross-court shots were difficult to win, used balls of varying distances, strengths, and weights to counter them, preventing him from constantly standing on the baseline to shoot. Once he had a chance, he would rush up to block. Qiu Feihai was indeed troubled by this. After a 3-3 tie, Gao suddenly took a 4-3 lead. At 4-4, 5-5, 6-6, and 7-7, the victory could not be decided. Qiu, in this situation, still insisted on not changing, using force to make cross-court shots and using extremely accurate left and right sideline balls to suppress his blocking. Gao was at his wits' end at this point. In the fifteenth game, he made two double faults. The first set was lost with a score of 7-9. In the second and third sets, Gao plummeted and was beyond recovery.</p>
<p>Gao Huimin's Hitting Method Was Not Bad Young and handsome, Gao</p>
<p>In the first set of the battle, Huimin had already shown his brilliant hitting method, although defeated, it was not bad. His forehand and backhand, especially his backhand, were steady and did not miss, which shows that the training was effective. The serve was also powerful, and the speed of his running was also helpful. His hitting method against Qiu Feihai was completely not bad. A deep shot, plus rushing up to block, and balls of varying weights and distances, prevented him from making baseline shots, which was the only way. However, Qiu was a veteran of the battlefield, and Gao inevitably lacked some experience.</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang Won Against Yang Lunzhang</p>
<p>Seven to Five</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang Six to Three Yang Lunzhang</p>
<p>Six to Four</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang Felt Satisfied Although Yang was a famous player in Singapore, he lost to Jiang in three straight sets yesterday. Except for the first set, which was slightly competitive, the second and third sets were completely under Jiang's racket. Yang was in a defensive position in several places. In the second set, the score was tied at 3-3. Jiang scored three more games to win 6-3. In the third set, Jiang won a big victory with a score of 5-1. The score was 6-4 in the end. Yang Lunzhang is not a singles player. Yang's singles skill is slightly inferior. He has a big grip on the serve, and there are many mistakes in the backhand. High balls and shots all give people a chance to kill the ball. However, when he is paired with Lin Wangsu in doubles, it is another story.</p>
<p>Malaysian Doubles Occupied Advantage</p>
<p>Lin Wangsu Four to Six Lin Baohua</p>
<p>(Malaysia) Six to Zero (Tianjin)</p>
<p>Yang Lunzhang One to One Gao Huimin</p>
<p>The Malaysian Doubles Partnership is Good The doubles match was not completed yesterday. Tianjin won the first set, and Malaysia won the second set outright. In the third set, Malaysia had a three-to-one lead. The match will continue today. In the first set, Malaysia lost four straight games to Tianjin due to Yang's lack of performance, touching the net, and double faults. After trailing 5-1, Malaysia regained three games but still lost 4-6. In the second set, Yang Lunzhang suddenly improved, and Lin Wangsu gained an assistant. Tianjin, on the other hand, was diminished by Gao Huimin's reduced performance and many mistakes. Malaysia then won six straight games. In the third set, Malaysia's momentum was still strong.</p>
<p>Lin Wangsu Showed Little Skill Looking at yesterday's doubles, Lin Wangsu is not only a good singles player, but also a doubles expert. He is very confident in high balls, and his strategy is also flawless. His forehand passing shot has no solution for Lin Baohua. The ball bounces off the racket and does not rise. Coupled with Yang Lunzhang's net killing, there is a great possibility of defeating Tianjin.</p>
<p>There Will Be a Great Battle Between Lin and Qiu Today</p>
<p>Today's semifinal between Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai is a long-awaited battle. After three years of separation, who is better? Viewers must be quick. The order is as follows: Doubles</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Lin Wangsu</p>
<p>2:00 p.m. (Tianjin vs) (Malaysia continues the match)</p>
<p>Gao Huimin Yang Lunzhang</p>
<p>4:00 p.m. Shanghai vs. the losing team in the Tianjin-Malaysia match</p>
<p>Singles</p>
<p>2:30 p.m. Lin Baohua vs. Qiu Feihai (Semifinal)</p>
<p>2:30 p.m. Jiang Daozhang vs. Lin Wangsu (Semifinal)</p>
<p>Tickets are divided into two types: six corners and one yuan. The one-yuan seat enters from Ma Lang Road and Father Lao Road, and the six-corner ticket enters from Kangdi Road. The association's complimentary tickets are still suspended.</p>

<p>No Matches Between China and Japan For Now</p>
<p>The Western Football Association announced that, in view of the deteriorating relationship between China and Japan and to avoid misunderstandings, it is doing its best to avoid Chinese and Japanese teams from meeting in the current schedule. Furthermore, the Zhenru Team has been renamed Jinan.</p>
<h3>Originally Half a Catty Equals Eight Ounces</h3>
<p>Malaya and Shanghai's Strength are Equal</p>
<p>In the first half, Shanghai, with strong players...Four to One. In the second half, Malaya reversed the situation...Three to One...Result: Four to Four Tie...Jinan Students Willing to Fight for Shanghai. The God of Wind Makes Trouble, Controlling the Fate of Both Armies. Shanghai's fans, blessed with good luck, were able to witness an exceptionally wonderful match between Malaya and Shanghai on the China Baseball Field amidst the cries of resisting Japan and saving the nation. The fate of both armies seemed to be half controlled by the God of Wind; the saying "the one who gets the wind wins" held true. Shanghai displayed amazing skills, leading four to one in the first half. Malaya demonstrated great spirit, reversing the situation three to zero in the second half. The result was a four-four tie. Originally both were wounded soldiers, so why bother distinguishing who is superior or inferior? Getting such a good result is something to be proud of.</p>
<p>Jinan Students Serve Shanghai</p>
<p>| The True Colors of Heroes |</p>
<p>The Association suddenly learned the night before that all Jinan students were said not to participate. Starting at eight o'clock yesterday morning, Director Zhou Jiaqi immediately mobilized volunteers everywhere. Shanghai certainly has many good players. When those recruited and invited were Guan Xun'an, Wang Shusen, Ouyang Yongyuan, Zhou Shaowen, and other righteous men. At the same time, the sports circles in Shanghai were also prepared to express serious dissatisfaction if Jinan refused to serve. However, Jinan students still reported for duty and served Shanghai. According to them, they knew nothing about this matter. A storm ended there. Good Men Petition for Disaster Victims</p>
<p>| Victory and Loss are Not Worth Mentioning |</p>
<p>The warriors on both sides, all masters in their fields, performed commendably. The Shanghai army, having been away from battle for a long time, had good skills, but lacked stamina. Malaya was relaxed at first but tightened up later, showing extraordinary spirit and high talent. The ninety-minute battle was truly a petition for disaster victims.</p>

<p>| Creating a Four to One Lead |</p>
<p>The referee team, Ji Xiang, announced the start of the battle. Within two minutes, Chen Zhenhe of Shanghai broke through with the wind, and Chen Hong first lunged and shot in, giving Shanghai the first goal. Malaya counterattacked and got a twelve-yard penalty kick. Guan Shunde responded by hitting the net, making it one-one. Shanghai attacked more than it defended, hovering near the enemy's goal, never leaving. At twenty minutes, Dai Linjing shot in a twelve-yard penalty kick, and Shanghai took the lead with two goals to one. Xu Yahui of Malaya broke through three barriers in a row, creating an excellent situation. Guan Shunde was about to take advantage of the situation to attack, but was jointly rescued by Zhou Jiayan, Chen Jiaqiu, Tu Kaiyuan, and others. After another ten minutes, Chen Hongguang, with the help of Li Yichen, scored another goal, making it three to one. The whole Malaya team attacked fiercely. Captain Ruan's header was in an excellent position, but fortunately, Zhou Xianyan was agile and skillful, so it was safe. In the last five minutes, Center Dai captured the pass and achieved his wish. In the first half, Shanghai led four to one.</p>
<h3>Football Match Between Malaya and Shanghai Teams (Li Guang Photograph)</h3>
<p>Malaya Displays Great Spirit</p>
<p>| Fighting to a Four to Four Tie |</p>
<p>In the second half, Malaya got the wind advantage and made a lot of noise, displaying great spirit and confronting Shanghai. At that time, Shanghai gradually became unable to support itself and was controlled by others. At the beginning of the game, Malaya's left inside headed in a goal, but it was not counted as offside. However, Malaya's siege has already taken shape. In about ten minutes, the left and right wings cooperated, Chen Meian picked the goal, and Chen Yushu punched it in. Malaya won a goal. The will is even more determined. Most of Shanghai's internal players were injured, but Jiang Shanjing was as tenacious as ever. Chen Zhenhe was transferred back to the center to sit and guard all directions. In the end, Malaya played better and better, and it was also difficult to cope with. Before long, Center Qiu took a single shot at the goal. The goalkeeper saved it, and Guan Shunde, the left inside, added a foot and rolled it into the net, making it four to three. Although Shanghai still had the lead, the situation was very bad, and the spectators were uneasy. Sure enough, within five minutes, Malaya Captain Ruan kicked in another goal, and the four-four tie was formed. The audience was very excited. Looking at the general trend, Shanghai was more likely to lose than win. However, in the last two minutes, Shanghai suddenly got an excellent opportunity. Liang Shutang headed the goal. Fortunately, the Malaya goalkeeper was calm and captured it with one hand, which was a great contribution to preserving the golden goal. The war ended, with both sides scoring four goals each, and ended peacefully.</p>

<h3>Heartbreaking Words</h3>
<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, I feel heartbroken every National Day. I used to be able to force a smile and shout "Long live the Double Tenth Festival" and "Long live the Republic of China" to go along with the story. I still hoped that the country would get better every year, so that we could see our compatriots and have some glory on our faces. Only then would I feel that National Day is truly worth celebrating. Who knew that in this year, I would watch natural disasters and man-made calamities invite internal and external troubles to descend together, making such a large Republic of China almost as far as those extinct countries. Alas, National Day, National Day, you are here again. Please forgive us for not being able to welcome you with smiles anymore. Only a pair of patriotic tears and a heart that hurts for the times are the only gifts we can give you.</p>
<p>Not Removing the Weeds in the Courtyard, Zhaifu Talks</p>
<h3>Carrying Four Crosses</h3>
<p>The cross is a Jewish instrument of torture, made of two pieces of wood, one horizontal and one vertical, forming a cross shape. The person being punished spreads both hands and is nailed to the horizontal wood, and the head and neck are nailed to the upper end of the cross. Since Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross, the cross has become a symbol of sacrifice in Western countries. What does our Double Tenth Festival mean? It is two crosses! We, the Chinese people, must sacrifice twice as much to get through this life-and-death juncture. Two years ago, I wrote a couplet for the Double Tenth Festival: "Sacrifice for destruction, sacrifice for construction, the Chinese people should carry two crosses." Today is October 10th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, which clearly requires us to carry four crosses. In addition to the usual destruction and construction, we must also sacrifice for the flood and sacrifice for resisting Japan! Huang Lizhou said: "It is easy to be generous in joining the army; it is difficult to calmly die for righteousness." From today onwards, we should calmly carry these four crosses!</p>
<h3>Feelings on the Double Tenth Festival in the 20th Year of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zilian</p>
<p>What day is today? It is the Double Tenth Festival, the National Day of the Republic of China. Although this National Day is permanent, it is not temporary. However, the Republic of China must exist forever, and then this memorial day can be preserved forever without being abolished. Therefore, every time the Double Tenth Festival, which is the National Day, all Chinese people do not raise their hands and celebrate with each other. However, what is worth celebrating is only the memorial day. Besides this, there is nothing to celebrate. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, this is the twentieth time that the Double Tenth Festival has been celebrated. However, in these twenty years, internal wars have not ceased, and foreign troubles are still ongoing. There is no fact worth celebrating. In this year, in addition to the disasters of war, there is also the addition of floods. The people in the country really have no way to make a living. What is there to celebrate? Recently, the violent Japanese have not hesitated to violate the conventions and dare to forcibly occupy my Eastern Province. On the day of the Double Tenth National Day, there is actually the shame of losing territory. Alas, Double Tenth, also lost. In the accent of Shanghai people, there is not much difference in reading it. Then this year's Double Tenth National Day can be said to be a loss of territory. However, the hearts of the people are not dead, and righteousness still exists. Even if the Japanese are violent, if my 400 million people can be of one mind and one heart and fight bravely, how can they not take the country of the Japanese archipelago and make it a place for me to drink the Yellow Dragon in pain? Because I think that the Shanghai people read the word Double as the same as the word Loss, and the Southerners read Ten as the same as the word Day. One day, a war will be fought, and if the Japanese are really lost, then today's Double Tenth Festival may not be impossible to celebrate the loss of the Japanese in advance. I only hope that my compatriots all over the country will not forget the shame of loss, and rise up to plan for the day of loss, then my Republic of China can be preserved forever without being destroyed, and this National Day can also be preserved forever without being abolished.</p>
<h3>Crying Bitterly and Talking About National Day</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The situation of the violent Japanese actively approaching is already so serious that it cannot be described. In these twenty days, the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin have been put on trial to become independent in disguise. Now they are advancing along the South Manchurian Railway and sending large fleets of warships to China to provoke. Airplanes bombed Jinzhou, and their murderous flames covered the sky. It seems that the destruction of the country is about to occur.</p>
<h3>Cries on National Day</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Gongs and drums are noisy. Firecrackers shake the earth. Flags and colors flutter. All the people are happy. What day is this? The solemn and splendid Republic of China was established on this Double Tenth Day.</p>
<p>Recalling the Wuchang Uprising, the martyrs shed hot blood and threw their heads, sacrificing their lives, and finally completed the revolution and laid the foundation of the country. When the martyrs see this annual National Day in the ground, they should also smile and close their eyes and be infinitely happy.</p>
<p>However, the celebration of the twentieth year of the Republic of China has not yet arrived. The Japanese suddenly advanced their troops and occupied my land and killed my people. My beautiful rivers and mountains have been contaminated by the iron shoes of the Japanese. It is painful. This year's Double Tenth National Day does not present the joyful scene of previous years. The Japanese are showing off their power in my country. My lost land has not been recovered. My strange hatred has not been avenged. I only hear the cries of the compatriots in the disaster area and the cries of the martyrs in the ground echoing each other from afar. My compatriots have thoughts of protection. The great disaster of the Japanese is already in sight. Alas, compatriots, this talk of "destroying the country and exterminating the race" is definitely not neurotic talk. We certainly trust the government to "unanimously calmly wait for a solution." However, to what extent and when will "calm" give me a real answer? But I dare to respectfully tell the government, "Non-resistance is suicide." "Calm is anesthesia." "Believing in the League of Nations is a fantasy." These three roads are all impassable. You should still seek a way out.</p>
<p>The peace talks between Beijing and Guangdong are said to be opened at the end of the month. What conditions are still being discussed? Isn't this a phenomenon that promotes the destruction of the country? May I ask, is it more important to fight for rights internally, or to save the people and the country? Parents, sisters, brothers, wives, and children are all trapped in the fire pit, and the two brothers sit and watch without going to save them, and still say cold words next to them. Is this still human psychology? You are all saying that you love the people and save the party and the country. This is the most effective testing ground.</p>
<p>Looking back on the 20th National Day, there were a few times when I barely made myself happy in the midst of suffering. This year? When I mention National Day, I cry bitterly and almost can't stop. Alas, if there were no warlords who were tyrannical and plundering, and no bureaucrats who were manipulating and saying right and wrong, and if there were wise, honest, strong governments, and resolute, enthusiastic, and united people, where would there be internal wars and foreign insults, and even more, where would there be the monstrous disaster of the violent Japanese invading and seizing the Northeast and ravaging the country? Therefore, who should bear the sin of "harming the country and endangering the people" is obvious. The previous kinds of things are unbearable to look back on. How should we start from now on? Everyone should wake up.</p>
<p>Today is National Day. We can only unite our hearts and efforts to awaken the national soul and resurrect it forever.</p>
<h3>The Double Tenth Festival of the Twentieth Year</h3>
<p>— Drunk Idiot</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. It is originally a day worth celebrating. This year's Double Tenth Festival is especially worth celebrating, because this year is the twentieth anniversary of the Republic of China, which is a double Double Tenth Festival. For example, for a person, the usual Double Tenth Festival is a small birthday, and this year's Double Tenth Festival is the real birthday, so it is especially worth celebrating. Who knows, things go against people's wishes. This lovely Republic of China has a troubled fate and is generally getting worse every year. Looking at today, dark clouds and poisonous fog fill China. In this year, there is the rampage of the Red Bandits and the rebellion of the Stone Ministry, and the tragedy of the flood is even more rare in modern times. Coupled with the strong neighbors, the Wanbaoshan incident started first, and the Korean massacre of overseas Chinese followed. Now they are even taking the risk of going against the great righteousness of the world and sending troops to forcibly occupy my three eastern provinces, massacring my compatriots and creating countless scars. The great disaster of national humiliation is still just beginning. On this auspicious day, I can only imitate Jia Sheng's bitter tears. Even if I want to be happy, I can't. It is really the so-called "When the festival comes, I feel more sad." Hanging is not necessary, how can there be celebration? But the previous kinds of things are like yesterday's death, and the later kinds of things are like today's birth. To create a new life depends entirely on the efforts of my people. The most important work after this is (1) to implement an economic boycott to control their lifeblood, (2) to implement military training to cultivate my strength, (3) to save national funds to revitalize the navy. Ten years of growth, ten years of teaching, sleeping on firewood and tasting gall, never forgetting. Great shame and great humiliation will eventually be cleared away, and our rivers and mountains will be restored, and a solemn and splendid Republic of China will be rebuilt. Then every Double Tenth Festival will be celebrated with joy and will not be as dim as today.</p>
<h3>Brief Talk on Resisting Goods</h3>
<p>— Shen Tingkai</p>
<p>Based on my personal experience in devoting myself to domestic goods for ten years and observing the results of previous boycotts of Japanese goods, I have some simple words to tell the people of the country.</p>
<p>If you advise ten, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, and even tens of millions of people not to use Japanese goods, why not conduct a detailed investigation of the few who have the qualifications to handle goods in Japan, those who have fixed qualifications to order goods from Japan, those who have the qualifications to wholesale Japanese goods, and those who handle goods from various provinces, cities, and large towns stationed in Shanghai, and impose strict punishments? If they are advised and do not change, then follow up with warnings, and if they do not change, then announce them to the world and impose harsh warnings, then people, even if they are ignorant, will know to turn back. Everything has its flow, and there should be its source. To save the crazy waves is not a difficult task. Therefore, the fundamental solution to boycotting Japanese goods is that on the one hand, the party should work hard to replace domestic goods and raw materials, but on the other hand, it should recognize the source and act, which can really achieve twice the result with half the effort and ultimately achieve great results.</p>
<p>If you only show temporary enthusiasm and forget the reason, shouting and yelling without looking for the source, it is appropriate that the past events are futile. May the wise men agree with my humble words. (Not paid)</p>
<h3>Our Righteous Man</h3>
<p>— Lin Liqin</p>
<p>Although this is an imaginary war, this war machine will eventually break out one day.</p>
<p>Sure enough, this unfortunate war has already occurred. The enemy's army, relying on the arrogance of successive victories, is already attacking our Shanhaiguan. The unfortunate and heartbreaking bad news deafened our eardrums in batches.</p>
<p>Our territory outside the pass is occupied by the enemy, and our compatriots outside the pass are massacred by the enemy. The enemy has robbed our resource-rich land, and the enemy's flag has tainted our country's territory. The enemy's territory will soon hit our home.</p>
<p>Compatriots, this is the most painful thing. Your property will be robbed by the enemy. Your wives and daughters will be raped and killed by the enemy. The enemy will cut your parents with their hands and slaughter yourself. What a painful tragedy. A five-year-old child will have his abdomen cut open and his intestines dug out. Under the iron hooves of the enemy, where are you going to move your property? Where do you want to hide your wives and daughters? Where are your parents going to take refuge? How are you going to protect your own life? You should know that the fierce and vicious enemies are here to destroy our country and destroy our clan.</p>
<p>Alas, our great Republic of China! Our great Republic of China's nation!</p>
<p>"When the country is in trouble, it is time for men to sacrifice themselves for the country."</p>
<p>This is a loud cry from a citizen of the Republic of China. I can't give his name, I only know that he has shaken off his spirit and mustered his courage to follow our soldiers to the national disaster.</p>
<p>He is our righteous man.</p>
<p>But I know that our soldiers have the determination to "laugh and lie on the battlefield and coexist with the country", and our righteous men are not only these many. All the people of China are our righteous men.</p>
<p>Charge. Melee is what our righteous men are brave to advance.</p>
<p>Resisting the enemy. Killing the enemy is what our righteous men hope to be effective.</p>
<p>And our soldiers, brave soldiers who devote themselves to the country, soldiers who work hard to resist and kill the enemy, soldiers who are brave to charge and melee.</p>
<p>Although we do not hope to wipe out the enemy, we also cannot bear to destroy the enemy's clan and destroy the enemy's country. But for the sake of the country, for the sake of the nation, for the sake of our parents, wives, and children, for the sake of our lives and property, for the sake of alas, for the sake of our future righteous men, for the sake of those poor children who are cut open and their intestines dug out by the enemy, we should catch up quickly and stand on a line of defense with our righteous men.</p>
<p>Of course. Our country, our nation, who dares to assert that it will be destroyed under the iron hooves of the enemy? Watch.</p>
<p>This is the most glorious page in our country's and nation's history. It is not only the great achievements of our righteous men, we should also praise our soldiers.</p>
<p>In this final decisive battle, our righteous men followed the brave soldiers and set off to the front to annihilate the enemy. Alas, an enemy bullet flew and hit the chest of our righteous man. Our righteous man endured this pain like ten thousand arrows piercing his heart, raised his arms and shouted, leading the soldiers to rush into the enemy's line of defense, annihilating countless enemies and personally beheading many enemy officers, and snatching the enemy's flag. He waited until the enemy was in a state of utter defeat, and he laughed wildly and broke the enemy's flagpole and tore up the enemy's national emblem. With the hot blood flowing from the wound on his chest, our righteous man smiled happily and lay on the battlefield. . Please watch, this is one of our righteous men in China.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Cannot Recover</h3>
<p>The gold price plummeted two or three qian. Yesterday, the benchmark gold price was again weak, and the waves were surging and the drop wind suddenly rose. The situation was complicated and it advanced and retreated suddenly, with no real control. From morning to night, there were twenty-three taels of twists and turns, and in the end it plummeted by twenty taels or more, which was due to all kinds of bad news. From the early morning, the silver market was reported to rise, and then the Yanhui asked, which led to people's hearts weakening. It had already broken through the 700 taels barrier. Various firms and speculators, such as Wu, sold off fiercely, and the exchange rates inside and outside the market were extremely loose and indiscriminate. Forced by the environment, it plummeted by ten taels. However, it was unpredictable for a moment. Later, the market was in a rage, with shocking waves and the selling atmosphere was excited. The foreign exchange rate was especially depressed, such as the US dollar has exceeded 33 yuan, and the British gold one shilling eight bian and above, which is really due to foreign telegraph rumors that the Japanese cabinet is even more shaky, and the violent Japanese in the eastern province are pressing on Jinzhou even more fiercely, and the market atmosphere is deteriorating and has suddenly fallen into 680 taels. Finally, it seemed a little relieved.</p>
<p>The morning opening had already revealed the ebb wind. The early morning opening in November and December had already dropped by six taels and eight qian, to six hundred and ninety-seven taels, the large bars were sixteen minutes and seven, the silver price was plus one-quarter, the private telegram rose sixteen minutes and five, and there were also many sellers. The next one was ninety-three taels. In an instant, the buying side seemed strong. Zhifengyong, Dadecheng and others all entered, and the US dollar was eaten by Shanghai, Pan Gen and others at 32.5 yuan on the twelfth of January. Then, the same industry made 22.3125, so it rose by more than eight taels, and at 9:10 it was 700 taels and three. However, large households such as Cuichangyong, Hengchangyong, Qianchangxiang, and Tongtaichang all sold. The US dollar was again, and it was calculated that 32.5 yuan and British gold were made at 1.79375, so it retreated to ninety-six taels. When the British gold opened, it was ninety-eight taels, and the listed number was 25. The US dollar was plus half a yuan, so it dropped one tael zero, to ninety-six taels and eight qian. However, Macgregor entered 32.4375 in January and exited 375 in December, and was also entered by hedgers, which suddenly added more than two taels, to ninety-nine taels and a half. After 9:40, the ebb wind gradually appeared. Qianchangxiang, Chengdayong, Chengfengyong, Hengchangyong, Da, and Wu Chen and others all came out, and it was also said that a certain bank also had a sell-off, so one tael was more than six taels. At 10:00, ninety-three taels of Guangdong help came in, and commodity hedging was also scrambling to buy, and the US dollar Macquarie Bank also ate 4375, and then sold to Mitsui 375, so it went back five taels, and at 10:30 it was ninety-eight taels and two or three qian. Afterwards, the wind was stronger and stronger, and British gold was long to 1.8, and entry and exit were possible. The US dollar unexpectedly rose to 32.6875, so the market situation was even more virtual and plummeted by ten taels, and at 11:30 it was eighty-eight taels and a half, and then there were slightly two or three taels up and down, and it retreated from ninety-one taels and a half to eighty-eight taels and eight qian, and the afternoon closing was eighty-nine taels, and the quoted price was changed to 770 taels, and it was calculated that 70 taels to 80 taels were pressed out.</p>
<p>The afternoon market is even more sinister. The afternoon market opened at eighty-eight taels and a half, followed by ninety-one taels and four. After that, the situation was sinister, because it was said that the Japanese cabinet was in turmoil and people's hearts were even more afraid. Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, Yuanxingyong and others sold each other, and the market also collapsed. The US dollar Zhejiang and other places were 33.125 yuan, and British gold was also entered at 1.8.25. Because of this, the gold price plummeted by eleven or two taels, and there was a tendency to collapse. After 2:30, it suddenly became seventy-eight taels and a half. Afterwards, there seemed to be more buyers, and the shorts were hedged, so there was profit to be gained. At 3:30, it was eighty-six taels. Afterwards, the Indian reported that it was two annas large. At 4:00, it was eighty taels and one qian, and Bingxing and Yuanxingyong bought in, and it was eighty-four taels and five. By 4:30, the market closed at eighty-three taels and a half, a sharp drop of twenty taels and three qian compared to the day before yesterday, and it was done until 4:30, to eighty-three taels.</p>
<p>The bare strip plus fourteen taels is calculated according to the largest 701 taels and three qian in one day and the smallest 678 taels and five. The difference is 22 taels and eight qian. The early market price of goods was ninety-three taels, the afternoon closing was eighty-eight taels, and the afternoon was eighty-nine taels. The closing price was eighty-two taels and five. It was calculated that eighty-six or seven taels were suppressed, and the book entry was supplemented with water at eighty-nine taels in the morning and eighty-four taels in the afternoon, and fourteen taels were added to the bare strip.</p>
<p>Speculation is more out than in. The face transaction is complicated. According to statistics, Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Futaiheng, and Yifengyong all entered. Wanxing, Shunli, Yuantai, Daxingyong, goods, etc. had entry and exit from time to time. Qianchangxiang, Chengfengyong, Yuanchengyong, Tongtaichang, Chengdayong, Cuichangyong, and Wu Chen all exited. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Bingxing, Yifengyong, and Yuanmaoyong all entered. Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, and Cuichangyong all exited. Shunli, Yuanxingyong, and Hengchangyong had very complicated entry and exit. Wu also exited, Dalian helped exit 1,000 and entered 700 or 800, and Guangdong helped enter 1,000 several hundred.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market Bright and Dark are Both Loosening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British, American, Indian, and silver markets all rose. The situation was quite firm, but softened at the end because American selling intentions did not cease. Exchange rate fluctuations were mixed. Almost all Shanghai listings rose. British gold rose by one increment, 25/100 for one shilling and seven and twenty-five hundredths pence. US dollars rose by half a yuan, totaling thirty-one yuan. The rest also rose, but Hong Kong remained at seventy-eight and a half taels. The internal trend, however, was particularly declining. As a result, compared to the previous day, British gold rose by 0.375, and the US dollar rose by 0.075. The market decline was even more severe, once breaking through 680 taels internally. Chinese merchants traded actively, with only 100,000 pounds of British gold and about 1.1 million US dollars being sold, mostly to profit from gold. The banks' appetite was not weak, and each US dollar was worth 3.2258 taels of silver. The changes in market conditions are difficult to predict. British exchange internal trading had a fluctuation of 0.3125. The morning offer was one shilling and seven and eight hundred seventy-five thousandths pence, and the buying price was 0.9375. Dutch traded with Shanghai at 0.9375 in February. East Asia entered at eight pence in December. Sino-Belgian Industry made a deal at eight pence. The afternoon closing offer was eight and sixty-two and a half thousandths pence, and the buying price was 0.25. In the afternoon, Zhejiang entered at 1.1875 in January, and then entered with Jinfeng at 0.25. The closing offer was 1.79375, and the buying price was 1.80625.</p>
<p>US exchange internal trading had a fluctuation of 0.875. The morning offer was thirty-two yuan and 0.375, and the buying price was thirty-two yuan and a half. Pan Gen of Shanghai Maihang entered at thirty-two yuan and a half in December and January. Traders made a deal at thirty-two yuan and three hundred twelve and a half ten-thousandths. Sino-Belgian Dutch made a deal at twelve yuan and a half. Sino-Belgian entered at the same price. Maihang and Sino-Belgian made a deal at the same price.

<h3>Call Loan Market Shows Signs of Rising Again</h3>
<p>Market Overview: The Chinese and foreign silver markets suddenly turned tight in the past two days. Although the reasons are unknown to outsiders, judging from the supply and demand situation in the market, there are two trends: (1) Foreign firms are purchasing large amounts of spot silver over long distances, and banks are also actively purchasing on their behalf. (2) Regarding silver availability, since before the end of September, long-term loans have been expiring soon. Banks are managing according to their capabilities, so the tightness of silver availability is not a problem. However, silver firms are facing difficulties in lending and recovering loans due to the economic downturn and disasters in various places, so they have to tighten up. As a result, both sides are tightening up, causing the silver availability to rise.</p>
<p>Call Loan Prices (Foreign Silver): The morning price for foreign silver was 0.72575, an increase of 0.00625 compared to the previous day's morning price.

Guangdong small silver dollars were priced at 0.6545 in the morning, and 0.655 in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 0.002 compared to the previous day. 135,000 units were traded in the morning, and 55,000 units were traded in the afternoon. Copper coins were slightly at 500 wen, totaling 375,000 wen.</p>

<h3>News of the Expiry of a Few Long-Term Loans</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a few long-term loans and collateral loans in the silver industry expired. (Note: These loans were originally due today, but were settled yesterday due to the Double Tenth holiday.) The amount verified was about 600,000 or 700,000, of which 300,000 or 400,000 were rolled over, and 200,000 or 300,000 were recovered. It was also heard that some long-term deposits from foreign firms were also transferred yesterday, and the interest rates would be determined by internal market conditions. In addition, the amount of collateral, including stocks, government bonds, and other valuable securities, was particularly stagnant. With the current market price declines, there is naturally no hope of redemption, and the collateral providers are finding it difficult to extend the loans. Therefore, negotiations are currently underway to determine whether to extend the loans. As for goods used as collateral, a few have been handed over to auction houses to be auctioned off to repay the debts. Securities and bond markets fell again, with trading halted. Afternoon conditions slightly improved, and off-exchange trading rose slightly. Yesterday (October 9th), trading in various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was scarce, with only the whole lot of 6% and demobilization bonds being traded. Trading in futures was also light, with multiple varieties being halted due to price declines in the morning. The trend was the opposite of the previous day, with many varieties being halted due to price increases the day before. Yesterday, the declines were very severe. As Japanese troops approached more urgently, the market became nervous, and investors were extremely cautious. Although large investors were not selling in large amounts, the market was still very different. The market prices of various bonds fell rapidly as soon as trading opened, and the declines were very sharp. For example, the 9% and 20% customs consolidated tax bonds immediately fell to the limit price and trading was halted. Other bonds, such as salt tax, demobilization, and troop reduction bonds, had not yet fallen to the limit price, but were only a few cents away from the limit price. Therefore, when trading opened later, salt tax, troop reduction, and 19% customs bonds were also reported to have been halted due to price declines. The only varieties that did not halt were customs tax, whole lot of 6%, demobilization, and 96 bonds. As a result, except for the 19% customs bonds for October, which rose by 1.4 yuan at the morning opening, all other varieties fell significantly. Even 96 bonds fell slightly by 1 yuan. Spot trading in whole lot of 6% bonds has been rare for a long time, and the price has fallen by 16.9 yuan compared to the middle of last month. Looking at the market situation yesterday afternoon, the prices of various bonds in off-exchange trading seemed to have risen slightly, and market sentiment had stabilized slightly after the price declines. In addition, the exchange is still considering the issue of submitting actual goods for futures contracts this month. Today is the Double Tenth Festival, and the market is temporarily closed. The total spot trading volume for the day was only 3,000 yuan, and the total futures trading volume was 7,900,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market Has Softened Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market is sluggish and trending downward. Due to various rumors about the current situation, people are uncertain and the market fluctuates up and down, making it difficult to stabilize. The anti-Japanese movement is still intense, and the supply of local yarn is insufficient, so spot yarn is extremely tight. Therefore, some are inclined to go long, but the future is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>People's Standard Prices Fall by Half a Copper Cash</p>
<p>The People's Standard Exchange opened weak in the morning due to sluggish market sentiment and a lack of buyers. Prices fell by one or two cash (0.026-0.027 yuan) each. The afternoon trend remained weak, and prices fell by 0.001-0.0025 yuan each. The total trading volume for the day was 48,700 bales. Jifeng sold 1,050 bales, Changji sold 1,200 bales, Shengtai sold 1,000 bales, Gengfeng sold 1,650 bales, Ruida sold 4,250 bales, and Changfeng sold 950 bales.

<h3>The Cotton Market Shows No Improvement</h3>
<p>The overall trend of the cotton market is still weak. As the US government estimated another increase in production of 599,000 bales of American cotton, market sentiment remained soft, and large investors tended to sell, making the market even more bleak and lifeless. In addition, the gold market was trending downward, and the selling price of foreign cotton was low. However, in the afternoon, some short sellers took profits and covered their positions, and most retail short sellers also closed their positions, so the market rebounded. The overall situation still does not escape the appearance of weakness.</p>
<p>Afternoon Short Covering Slightly Rebounds Han Standard Prices</p>
<p>The People's Standard Exchange opened weak in the morning due to the increase in American cotton. The market was flat, and prices fell by 0.02-0.03 yuan each. In the afternoon, prices rebounded due to profit-taking and short covering. The trading volume was 155,800 dan. Xincheng sold 8,400 dan, Changfeng sold 7,800 dan, Changhe sold 5,400 dan, and Changji sold 3,300 dan. Duanda bought 13,300 dan, Tianjiang bought 4,100 dan, and Yichang bought 3,800 dan.

The Ningbo trading group has purchased 7,000 tons of standard-grade small-grain semi-polished rice for November delivery from foreign trading companies such as Jicheng and Yuanxing at a price of 4.6 taels. Local merchants also purchased 100 tons of white standard-grade small-grain rice for November delivery at a price of 5.0 taels.</p>
<h3>Recent Flour Prices are Rising Rapidly</h3>
<p>Large Factories are Using "Buy Near, Sell Far" Hedging Strategies</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was suspended in the morning because buyers failed to deliver margin payments on time. The exchange announced a temporary suspension of trading. In the afternoon, most of the margin payments were delivered, and the exchange decided to resume trading, but ordered both parties to settle quickly. New trading will begin on Monday. As short sellers were actively covering their positions, and news of rising foreign wheat prices circulated, the flour market turned around, and various months of wheat prices rose. The closing price for the current month rose 0.011 yuan, November rose 0.009 yuan, December rose 0.008 yuan, January rose 0.008 yuan, February rose 0.01 yuan, and March also rose 0.01 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Price of Standard Wheat Rose Sharply in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Trading Suspended in the Morning Due to Margin Payments</p>

<h3>The Customer View for Longkou Noodles is Declining</h3>
<p>The market price of Longkou cellophane noodles has risen by more than 0.1 yuan due to the shortage of inventory. However, sales from various groups have gradually decreased, so the price has fallen back. It was heard yesterday that another batch of goods has arrived, and sales are sluggish. Therefore, the future market is unlikely to stabilize, and the customer view is bound to decline.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Rejected the Japanese Consul's Request</p>
<p>The City Federation of Trade Unions Held a Representative Congress Yesterday</p>
<p>The General Headquarters Replied to the Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<p>We Will Focus Our Efforts</p>
<p>For the Shanghai Citizens' Congress for Anti-Japanese National Salvation: We have received your telegram. The atrocities of the Japanese invaders have angered everyone in the world. The central government has vowed to defend the party and the country and will not sit idly by while they are rampant. We will focus all our efforts to find a proper solution. Respectfully, the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Jiang Weishen.</p>
<p>Municipal Government's Righteous Words</p>
<h3>Rejection of the Japanese Consul General's Request</h3>
<p>The Government Cannot Suppress Patriotic Movements</p>
<p>It Will Be Absolutely Responsible for the City's Security</p>
<p>Japanese Consul General Murai in Shanghai personally brought a request to the Municipal Government a few days ago, requesting two points: (1) Release the detained Japanese goods; (2) Suppress the people's movements. The Municipal Government not only rejected the request orally at the time, but also formally replied to the consul in writing yesterday. The content of the reply was as follows: Regarding the first request, if it can be proven that the goods belong to Japanese merchants, they can of course be released. However, if the goods belong to Chinese merchants, this is an action of the people themselves, and the government is not in a position to stop it. As for the people's movements, they are the result of the people's patriotic feelings. As long as they do not go beyond the bounds of reason, the government has no reason to suppress them. However, the Municipal Government is extremely responsible for the security of Shanghai and will do its best to protect the lives and property of foreigners. The joint announcement issued by the Municipal Government and the City Party Headquarters a few days ago is sufficient to show the Municipal Government's attitude of being responsible for maintaining security. Those who disrupt order and go beyond the bounds of reason will be severely punished. However, in addition to ordering the people to strictly abide by order, the Municipal Government hopes that the consular office will also impose appropriate restrictions on the Japanese residents in Shanghai to avoid disputes.</p>

<p>Citizens’ Federation Sends Letter to Consuls of Various Countries</p>
<p>Irregular Actions of Japanese Military and Civilians</p>
<p>Request for Intervention to Stop Them</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation sent a letter yesterday to Consul-General Cunningham of Shanghai, which stated: "Respectfully, the entire Chinese citizenry of the Shanghai International Settlement, while actively seeking aid for the flood disasters in various provinces of China, are faced with the sudden deployment of Japanese troops occupying key areas in the Northeast, including Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. This has led to the tragic killing of Chinese soldiers and civilians, and the seizure of Chinese property, resources, and military equipment. Since September 18th, these actions have intensified daily. Moreover, multiple naval warships have been dispatched to pressure Chinese territorial waters, and numerous aircraft have been sent to drop bombs in key areas of the Northeast, resulting in a large number of civilian deaths and countless destroyed buildings. Such actions not only violate international law and disrupt peace in East Asia, but also constitute unprecedented atrocities. Recently, armed Japanese soldiers have been repeatedly seen parading and demonstrating in the Shanghai International Settlement, causing unusual alarm among Chinese citizens. Furthermore, Japanese individuals, in conjunction with police officers, are tearing down patriotic slogans posted by Chinese citizens everywhere. This has created extreme unease among Chinese citizens within the International Settlement. As the authority responsible for maintaining security and order in the International Settlement, no measures have been taken to prevent the irregular activities of Japanese military and civilians. Given the widely known ambition of the Japanese, the responsibility for any unfortunate incidents that may occur, resulting in harm to people, damage to property, or even disruption to the order and security of the International Settlement, is not insignificant. In this moment of extreme alarm, we, the Chinese citizens, have dispatched representatives to the Municipal Council to request your Excellencies, the Consuls, to examine and oversee all matters. We also hope for a response, to solidify our public amity."</p>
<p>Fei Xintun Expresses to Citizens:</p>
<p>Shanghai’s Security Can Be Guaranteed, No Worries</p>
<p>No Interference in Patriotic Movements</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation publicly appointed representatives Qian Longzhang, Jiang Xinzhao, Qiu Liangyu, Yu Hualong (with Wu Banjiang as a substitute) and three others at 10 AM yesterday, preparing an official letter and visiting Mr. Fei Xintun, Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau, requesting that he prohibit Japanese military demonstrations within the concession and guarantee the patriotic movement of Chinese citizens in order to maintain peace and uphold justice. Upon arrival at the Bureau, they first met with the Chinese co-director, He Dekui, informing him of the details of the city-wide representative conference held the previous day, as well as the requests of the Chinese citizens. They requested that he convey the information to Director-General Fei so that they could discuss everything in person. Director-General Fei Xintun was introduced by Co-Director He, and met with them personally. After exchanging pleasantries, the representatives Qian and Jiang successively recounted the atrocities committed by the Japanese army in the Northeast, the continuous demonstrations in the concession, and the truth about the Chinese citizens' patriotic movement. They then presented two requests: (1) In order to maintain the security of the concession's citizens, the Engineering Bureau should immediately devise methods to prevent the Japanese army from landing, deploying armed forces, demonstrating, and provoking incidents in the concession. (2) The Engineering Bureau should protect all patriotic movements of Chinese citizens and should not interfere with them. These two points are the most urgent issues at present, and are the responsibilities that the Engineering Bureau authorities should bear. They requested an immediate approval and a written response. Director-General Fei verbally responded to each of the points as follows: "Recently, due to disputes between China and Japan, Chinese citizens have been aroused by righteous indignation and have engaged in patriotic movements. At the same time, Japanese residents and soldiers have also acted rashly, demonstrating within the concession. This is truly unfortunate. The Engineering Bureau's responsibility lies in carefully handling this difficult problem. However, the Engineering Bureau is a public municipal organization of various countries and cannot be partial to either side. It can only do its best to protect the safety of citizens of all countries within the concession within its authority. This should be understood by the Chinese citizens. Regarding the matter of the Japanese army landing and demonstrating with armed forces in the concession, the Engineering Bureau is also paying close attention. However, the Engineering Bureau is limited by its regulations and has no authority to restrict or interfere. Therefore, in addition to asking the Consul-General to inform the Japanese authorities and advise them not to take such actions again to avoid accidental misunderstandings, it has also used various methods to advise the Japanese Consul and military leaders to pay attention to the security of the concession. Although there is no concrete answer at present, according to private sources, it is known that there are only slightly more than 700 Japanese troops in Shanghai. After negotiations by various parties, the results are quite good. It is possible that all demonstration activities will soon cease. The Japanese troops that have not yet arrived in Shanghai will also not land. Therefore, Shanghai's security can be guaranteed. Citizens inside and outside the concession can rest assured. Regarding the patriotic movements of Chinese citizens within the concession, the Engineering Bureau will absolutely not interfere as long as they are within the scope of the law. However, it is feared that there will be actions outside the bounds, which the Engineering Bureau will have difficulty handling. Because the Japanese residents also have public delegation representatives who have come to the Bureau in multiple batches requesting a crackdown, and Consul Murai officially sent a letter to negotiate and presented evidence of insulting organizations. Chinese citizens should pay attention to this point in the future. However, I will immediately inform the police chief again that legal patriotic movements will not be interfered with. I and friends from various countries deeply admire the Chinese people's cultivation efforts this time. If they can continue to adhere to the scope, they will eventually be able to gain the sympathy of countries around the world. Therefore, I hope Chinese citizens will always pay attention to this point. In short, although the Engineering Bureau has no power to interfere with the Japanese military's demonstration activities, it has done its best to advise them. Now that the representatives have come to the Bureau to state their case, it will certainly work harder to advise and stop them. The Chinese, Japanese, and representatives from various countries also met the other day to discuss the security issues within the concession, and the results were quite good. Therefore, it is expected that no unexpected disputes will occur. However, citizens of various countries should also understand the Engineering Bureau's position and powers, and work together to maintain the security of the concession, so that citizens of all countries can benefit." After the talks, it was already noon. The representatives believed that the result was satisfactory, so they bid farewell and left. The federation will convene representatives from various districts based on this report for joint discussion.</p>
<h3>Concession Merchants Selling and Transporting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Yesterday Issued a Notice of Advice</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of issuing advice, as per the letter from the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, which roughly stated that our country has unfortunately suffered the military trampling of the violent Japanese, and all who have blood in their veins should respond with shared hatred and enmity. However, concession merchants may not understand the greater good, and are using the opportunity to continue business as usual. The standing committee has resolved on two methods for dealing with concession merchants who sell and transport Japanese goods: (1) First, issue a warning. (2) If the warning is not heeded, detain and punish the shop owner when they leave the concession, or confiscate goods made from Japanese goods or raw materials as if they were Japanese goods, etc. We are passing on this advice with special emphasis, hoping that our concession merchants will be inspired by their conscience and refrain from buying and selling Japanese goods in the future. We deeply pray for this."</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchants Implement Boycott</h3>
<p>Telegram from Canada, addressed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: "Japanese soldiers irrationally occupy our territory and kill our people. The entire overseas Chinese community is indignant. Our association is implementing a boycott of Japanese goods. Please adopt a similar stance and relay it to the entire country. Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Vancouver, Canada, respectfully."</p>

<h3>Japanese Merchants End Their Buying and Selling</h3>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee Yesterday Sent a Letter to Wang Yiting, stating: "Since the violent Japanese invaded our Northeast, the entire country has been indignant, and the movement to resist Japan and save the nation has risen up. All those who serve Japanese merchants have resigned one after another to show their determination. It is said that you, sir, have also resigned from your position as comprador of Nissin Company and have vowed never to engage in any economic activities for the Japanese side again, which shows that your patriotic zeal is not behind anyone else. However, all parties have praised you highly and have deep expectations of you. Recently, regarding your resignation from the Nissin Company, letters have been sent to us inquiring anxiously about the matters of your termination. Since our Association does not know when the termination matters will be cleared up after your resignation, it is difficult to reply. Therefore, we have sent you this special letter and hope that you can clearly indicate the information so that we can relay it to comfort the public's expectations."</p>
<h3>Shipping News in the Midst of Anti-Japanese Sentiment</h3>
<p>Wuhu Strike: Rapeseed in Wuhu is usually transported by Nissin liners to Shanghai and then to Japan. The workers on the Nissin wharf pontoon and all the lighter workers in the area, due to their patriotic zeal, have unanimously gone on strike against Japanese ships since yesterday and will not load or unload passengers or goods. Nissin's import and export cargo in Wuhu has been completely stopped.</p>
<p>Chinese Employees Resign: Following the resignation of Chinese crew members and sailors on the Osaka Canton Maru, the company received a telegram yesterday stating that 90 Chinese crew members, sailors, and stokers on the Fukien Maru, which operates between Shanghai, Fuzhou, Taiwan, and Tianjin, have also resigned. The ship is scheduled to enter port today. Upon receiving the news, the Osaka company has decided on countermeasures. They plan to prevent the Fukien Maru from entering port and have it anchored at Wusong to force the Chinese employees on board to be unable to disembark. However, it is said that the Chinese employees have made up their minds. If the Japanese cannot disembark, they will not work.</p>
<p>Shenyang Arsenal</p>
<h3>Those Affected to Hold Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Preparing to Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>News of the Factory's Recent Situation</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army forcibly occupied Liaoning, those affected by the Shenyang Arsenal have escaped to Shanghai one after another. For the sake of livelihood, they have gathered to organize a relief association for those affected, and a general meeting will be held today to discuss plans, including a petition. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Purpose of the Petition: More than 2,100 people affected by the Shenyang Arsenal have arrived in Shanghai. The relief association will hold a general meeting at Qu Zhenren Temple at 9 AM today to discuss livelihood issues and prepare to petition in Beijing, demanding: (1) The workers have not been paid for two and a half months of work at the factory. They demand that the National Government telegram Vice Commander Zhang to make up the payment so that they can safely send their families back to their hometowns. (2) The workers have some experience in manufacturing military equipment. They demand that the National Government set up an institute to accommodate them to help the national effort and avoid unemployment. Before the petition, they request the Municipal Government of Shanghai: (1) Those affected who have come to Shanghai are all from other provinces and have been displaced, suffering from hunger and cold. They demand that the Municipal Government provide them with food daily from today onwards to maintain the status quo. (2) The workers are going to Beijing to petition the National Government. They demand that the Municipal Government contact the Shanghai Railway Bureau to issue free round-trip train tickets so that they can set off immediately.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the Factory: Yesterday, after the Yuxing Wheel of the Bank Zhao Xing Company arrived in Shanghai from Yingkou, more than 100 more people affected by the factory arrived. Those who have no home to return to are still temporarily staying at Qu Zhenren Temple. Yesterday, they told reporters from the New Voice News that the factory employed four Japanese technicians, including Matsui. When the Japanese soldiers attacked, the Japanese technicians first offered maps and led the attack on the arsenal, so it was completely occupied in a few hours. Later, Honjo, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, appointed Hong Gongyu, a Chinese technician in the arsenal's inspection office, as the temporary director of the arsenal and the deputy commander of martial law in Shenyang (because Hong's wife is Japanese and usually close to the Japanese). The arsenal workers who did not escape were each given half a liter of soybeans per day by Hong as food. How can this maintain the livelihood of a family of several people? Currently, the Japanese organized the self-defense police, and the heads of the police are all Japanese. They also hung up the Japanese flag. Although there are Chinese police, they have no bullets. A small number of shops were forced to open by the Japanese army, but there is no business at all. After 4 PM, they close down. At night, there are no pedestrians on the road except for Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Zhang Mudan and Luo Shuwen</p>
<h3>Discuss the Abduction of Feng Yong</h3>
<p>Zhang Mudan, a professor at Feng Yong University in the Northeast, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency visited his residence yesterday and recorded the following account of the various situations before and after the Northeast Incident and the destruction of Feng Yong University.</p>
<p>The situation of the Northeast Incident: According to his account, the land in the Northeast is fertile, but the people are unsophisticated. The government imposes heavy taxes, making the lives of farmers even more difficult. Moreover, they are under the control of Japanese imperialism. The suffering of the people there is imaginable. As for the details of the Shenyang disaster, they have been reported repeatedly, but unfortunately, they are not entirely complete. Now, I will tell you what has not been reported. On the morning of the sixth, people in Shenyang saw that the Japanese had laid electrical networks all along the South Manchurian Railway line, built fortresses along the Andong line, and the Japanese army was training day and night in the suburbs of Shenyang, using large cannons to attack Shenyang City as the target and shouting slogans, slaughtering the Jiangwutang and eradicating the Beida Camp. They also held a victory celebration and a rickshaw pullers' discussion meeting. At that time, the whole city rumored that the Japanese army planned to occupy Shenyang City during the Mid-Autumn Festival. On the morning of the 18th, community leaders asked the authorities about the rumored incident, but the authorities denied it. At 4 PM, people from all walks of life in the city held a citizens' meeting and telegraphed Zhang Xueliang. At 11 PM, the incident occurred, and they besieged Shenyang City. They also divided their troops to attack Beida Camp. At the same time, the Japanese army notified the consuls of various countries by telephone, saying that they were advancing troops for self-defense. The soldiers in Beida Camp were eager to fight bravely, but were stopped and retreated by their superiors, resulting in a large number of deaths from bombing. At 5 AM on the 19th, the Japanese army entered the city in force, sealed off various government agencies, and the seals were inscribed with the words "Occupation by the Great Japanese Empire". They also issued a notice to the citizens in the name of the Kwantung Agency Shenyang City. At that time, Japanese rogues and unscrupulous Koreans wreaked havoc, raping, looting, and doing whatever they wanted. The panic among the citizens reached its peak. The Shenyang Municipal Government organized by the Japanese is now composed of 600 Chinese self-defense police, but then they slaughtered all the self-defense police and raided the residences of important people, searching for cash from refugees. The order became more and more chaotic. The Japanese army on the Beining Road was brutal, and the atrocities in Changchun, Yingkou, and other places were also carried out to the extreme. When I left Shenyang, the Japanese were actively preparing for war and transporting large quantities of military supplies to China. Their cruel intentions fully exposed their national character.</p>
<p>The Abduction of Feng Yong: Principal Feng Yong is the son of an official and has a family fortune of 50 million. He has a patriotic heart and is willing to sacrifice all his glory, spending huge sums of money to run Feng Yong University for four years, having already spent 3.5 million yuan. Therefore, the various facilities in the school are extremely complete, with a total of more than 1,600 students. The students at the school must receive military training. During the Sino-Russian War, Feng Yong once led the Feng Yong student army to the front line, which attracted the attention of the Japanese. The Japanese government sent two Japanese people disguised as students to the school to find out the contents of Feng Yong University, but they were eventually expelled. After the Japanese army occupied Shenyang City, the Japanese sent people to Feng Yong three times, asking him to lead Liaoning Province and urging Feng Yong students to resume classes, but they were all rejected. On the afternoon of the 21st, the Japanese army drove three cars full of armed soldiers to the school, claiming to meet the principal. At that time, Feng was repairing the plane, wanting to fly to Pingwu Deputy Zhang (the school has two military touring aircraft), and reiterated the previous request, but it was not granted. Feng said that the machine was broken and could not be used. The next day (the 22nd) afternoon, a large number of armed Japanese soldiers surrounded the entire school, forcing all the students in the school into one room with machine guns set up at the door. They searched and destroyed the school. After all the guns and ammunition in the school were searched, they threatened the students to help move them to freight cars. Dozens of students were shot dead at the time, and Feng Yong was also abducted at this time. His life and death are still unknown. It is hoped that the whole country will give him national salvation assistance. Zhang also said that the Japanese are taking advantage of the economic panic in various countries and the natural disasters in our country to invade Mongolia. He deeply hopes to rise up with the people of the country and unanimously resist Japan. It is shameful and weak to seek help from the League of Nations without self-strengthening.</p>
<p>Luo Shuwen's Speech: Since Feng Yong University in Shenyang was surrounded and disarmed by the Japanese army, all the faculty, staff, and students were expelled and have escaped from danger and arrived safely in Beiping. They have also appointed representatives to go to Beijing to petition. A reporter from the New Times News Agency met Mr. Luo Shuwen, the petition representative of the school who came to Shanghai on business, and asked him about the latest news and future plans of the school. He gave a detailed reply, which is recorded as follows: Mr. Luo said that on the 23rd of last month, Feng Yong University was forced by the Japanese army to hand over more than 100 rifles and more than a dozen boxes of ammunition, and the principal, Feng Yong, was abducted. All the students in the school tried desperately to rescue him, but the Japanese used bayonets to stab the students who got close, causing many injuries on the spot. The students had no weapons and had to let the Japanese abduct Principal Feng and expel all the students and teachers from the school, without allowing them to stay. All the luggage and sundries were looted by the Japanese army. When the Japanese army left the school, they guarded the school gate with armed forces and subjected them to a detailed inspection. As a result, of the more than 300 people who left the school, they had no money. They had to spend the night outdoors. On the morning of the 24th, they took a free car to Ping via Huanggu Village and lived in the Graduate School of Normal University. However, since Principal Feng has not been released, it is not easy to restore the school's affairs without a leader. In addition, the school funds are not available. The daily meals in Ping are provided by the Relief Association. If this continues, their studies will be a problem. Therefore, on the first day of this month, an emergency meeting was held in Ping, and Luo Ying, Shu Lai Chengke, and I were appointed to go to Beijing to petition the National Government Central Party Department to find a way to restore the school as soon as possible. Since I came to Shanghai on business, I left one day earlier than the two representatives Luo Lai. Luo Lai will leave for Beijing on the Beijing-Ping train on the 6th and should arrive in Beijing today. I will also take the night train to Beijing tonight. In short, the Japanese army has been plotting to invade and occupy the provinces of Northeast China for a long time. Feng Yong University has long been viewed with suspicion by Japan. Therefore, after the Japanese army entered Shenyang, they immediately surrounded our school and carried out a massive ransacking. If the students resisted slightly, they would be severely beaten. It is painful to say. During the previous Sino-Russian War, our students organized a student army and went to the front line to serve. If the Northeast Army resisted when the Japanese opened fire on our country, we would also organize a student army again, take up arms to defend the country, and fight to the death with the Japanese. But the Northeast armies, who are usually pampered and comfortable, adopt a policy of non-resistance when the enemy comes, retreating step by step, resulting in the loss of four provinces in one night. Our country's soldiers and civilians are killed and injured under non-resistance. Now, they endure the sight of our great land being trampled by the Japanese. Those who have the responsibility to defend the land and protect the people, what will they say to the people of the country? Today, the army is in our Northeast, burning, killing, looting, just like in the past. If the government can make up its mind to declare war on Japan, it will be the day we risk our lives on the battlefield and never steal a living and wait to be slaughtered to protect our national soul.</p>
<p>Students and Officers Studying in Japan Return Home</p>
<p>Sun and Li, Two Representatives, Arrived in Shanghai First</p>
<p>Our country's youth, studying at the Japanese Army Academy in the 22nd and 24th terms, totaling more than 170 people, have all been filled with righteous indignation since hearing that the violent Japanese invaded and occupied the Northeast. All the students unanimously decided to withdraw from school immediately and return home to serve. They first appointed Sun Baogang and Li Wu as representatives to come to Shanghai to negotiate. It is heard that the two representatives Sun and Li have already arrived here yesterday and first went to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to report the process of withdrawing from school and returning home this time, and hope to give spiritual and material assistance when all the students arrive in Shanghai. Feng Yixian and Xue Guangqian of the association received them, gave them some comfort, and said that they would convey the points mentioned to the Standing Committee and provide the maximum assistance within the possible range. The two representatives then went to the Municipal Party Department and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations of various universities to negotiate, and planned to take the train to Beijing this morning to report everything to Chairman Chiang and petition the Central Military Academy to set up a special class to accommodate returning students, continue to give them military training, fill their academic qualifications, and make it easier for them to sacrifice for the country.</p>
<p>Officers in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Organizing a National Pacification Army</h3>
<p>Over eighty retired military officers in Shanghai, including Zuo Huiren, have sought to gather retired officers scattered across various regions to form a strong National Pacification Army to resist Japan. This force, requiring no training, could be deployed immediately. The organizational structure involves a single army commander, concurrently held by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. All participating officers, regardless of their former rank, will be considered army personnel, providing their own pay and uniforms, with weaponry supplied by the headquarters. It is reported that this plan has been submitted to Commander-in-Chief Chiang for approval and implementation.</p>

This inspection of Japanese goods is organized voluntarily, and all colleagues in the industry must comply. The resolution of this meeting is to completely clear the inspected goods within a limited time. Anyone who is insincere or deliberately conceals proposals is a traitor and will be reported to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for handling. The Expression of the Christian National Salvation Association The Shanghai Christian National Salvation Association issued a letter to Christians nationwide regarding the Japanese imperialists' occupation of the three northeastern provinces (excerpt): My dear Christians, the time has come, the Christian war horn has sounded! Now we must organize our ranks, inspect our strength, and unite together, hand in hand with the oppressed masses, to declare war on our common enemy, Japanese imperialism, and advance bravely, treading on the bloodstains of the afflicted masses, fighting "for humanity, justice, and righteousness," and fighting "for freedom, equality, and fraternity." We now want to: (1) telegraph Christians worldwide to urge the governments of various countries to monitor the violent acts of Japanese imperialism; (2) telegraph the oppressed masses worldwide to unanimously sympathize and assist in urging the national government to implement true diplomacy representing the interests of the people; (4) all the people of the country unite to declare war on Japan.

<p>Recently, rumors have been circulating in this city, causing widespread panic among the citizens. The municipal government authorities have repeatedly stated that they are absolutely responsible for maintaining order, but the spread of rumors cannot be avoided. It is now learned that, to prevent the spread of rumors and stabilize public sentiment, the municipal government is having the secretary-general and department heads take turns on night duty, with one department head and six staff members assigned each night. At the same time, staff members will patrol and inspect to monitor rumors from outside.</p>
<h3>Conversation with Military and Political Authorities</h3>
<p>Rumors are Groundless</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, since the arrival of Japanese warships in Shanghai, rumors have suddenly spread widely. To thoroughly stabilize public sentiment, a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency visited Mayor Zhang and Deputy Adjutant Jiang of the Garrison Headquarters. The conversations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Conversation According to Mayor Zhang's statement to the reporter of the Hua Dong News Agency, the recent unfounded rumors in Shanghai are not only without any basis in fact, but also spread to Zhenjiang and the capital, causing mutual panic. For example, when I went to Nanjing the other day, it coincided with rumors that Shanghai had been occupied. On that day, I took the 3:00 PM Shanghai-Nanjing train. When the train arrived in Zhenjiang, many people were waiting at the station to ask me if the news of Shanghai's capture was true. At the time, I was very surprised, so I asked the people where the news came from and when it happened. They said that the news of the capture was said to have occurred before 3:00 PM on that day, and the source of the news was said to be a certain party affairs organization. When I heard this, I couldn't help but smile and solemnly told them, "I am Zhang Qun, the mayor of Shanghai. I departed from Shanghai at 3:00 PM today, and the situation in Shanghai is very peaceful. Please do not easily believe rumors and cause self-panic, and please inform all sectors to reassure the people." The people were happy to leave. Unexpectedly, when the train arrived in the capital and I arrived at the station, there were many people who came to ask me whether Shanghai and Zhenjiang had been completely occupied by the Japanese on that day. I also solemnly reported this to them. Thinking that the distance between Nanjing and Shanghai is not far, the speed of the rumors is already like this. Arriving in Zhenjiang, they said that Shanghai had fallen; arriving in the capital, they said that Shanghai and Zhenjiang had been occupied at the same time. These kinds of rumors, which have no common sense, are truly ridiculous. The public's minds are simple, and with added embellishments, the situation is even more uneasy. Today, during the municipal government's municipal affairs meeting, I also reported in detail. As for the rumor of the National Government moving the capital, it is even more completely imaginary. Thinking that the National Government is the highest authority in the country, it cannot be compared to ordinary people, how can it be arbitrarily moved? Moreover, the phone between Nanjing and Shanghai can reach in an instant. These kinds of facts can be inquired at any time. The reporter also asked whether the Jing Bao's report that the mayor had suppressed the patriotic movement was true. Zhang said that this was a misunderstanding. On that day, Japanese Consul-General Inoue personally brought a letter requesting the municipal government to protect Japanese residents and to suppress anti-Japanese movements and provocations by Chinese towards Japanese. I replied at the time that the people's anti-Japanese movement was entirely caused by the Japanese side. Patriotism is common to all countries, and it is difficult to suppress it unless it goes too far. If our people's anti-Japanese actions go too far, then the municipal government will be responsible for maintaining security and protecting foreign residents, and will stop it at any time. The report in that newspaper was too brief, leading to this misunderstanding. Now, in addition to verbally replying to the Japanese consul, we have also formally replied to the Japanese consulate today, solemnly declaring this matter. On the one hand, we must suppress the provocative actions of the Japanese, and on the other hand, we must ask them to inform Japanese officials and civilians stationed in Shanghai not to disturb Shanghai. The municipal government has always been fully responsible for the safety of foreign residents of all countries.</p>
<p>Conversation with Deputy Adjutant Jiang It is reported that Deputy Adjutant Jiang of the Garrison Headquarters said that the Garrison Headquarters had also heard about the various rumors. However, all the rumors are absolutely inaccurate. The situation today is exactly the same as usual. The Garrison Headquarters is dispatching secret agents to various parts of the city to curb the rumors. The Garrison Headquarters is fully responsible for the security of Shanghai, and the Japanese side, although it has sent warships to China to show its strength, will never dare to provoke easily, lest it be spurned by all countries of the world. It is hoped that the merchants of this city will live in peace and not cause self-panic, otherwise they will be ridiculed by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>Two Japanese Warships May Arrive</p>
<p>Carrying 800 Marines</p>
<p>Two Japanese warships may arrive in Shanghai today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Tokiwa The Japanese Navy Ministry ordered the dispatch of 400 marines from the Sasebo Naval Port, under the command of Navy Lieutenant Commander Mori, to be transported to China by the coastal defense ship Tokiwa. They left Japan at 2:00 AM on the 9th and are sailing urgently to Shanghai. It is estimated that they will arrive at Wusong at dawn this morning and will enter the Huangpu River at 10:00 AM today. The marines on board will land today and will be stationed in the Hongkou area.</p>
<p>The Tenryu The Japanese authorities also ordered the dispatch of 400 marines from the naval corps in the Kure Naval Port to Shanghai. They have assigned the special service ship Tenryu to transport them and departed from Japan last night. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Mamoru Shigemitsu Went to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Submit a Protest Against Anti-Japanese Demonstrations to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>The Japanese cabinet decided to issue a final warning to our government, protesting the anti-Japanese national salvation movement of our people. Mamoru Shigemitsu, the Japanese ambassador to China, received instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday morning and left Shanghai by Japanese warship at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to go to Nanjing to personally submit the warning to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also planned to participate in the Double Tenth National Day celebrations in Nanjing. Lin Chu and Asahi Nai, secretaries of the Japanese Embassy, accompanied Shigemitsu to Nanjing yesterday.</p>

<h3>Baoshan Road</h3>
<p>Grief of the Victims' Families</p>
<p>The Bodies Were Collected by Relatives</p>
<p>Firm Request for the Death Penalty</p>
<p>Relatives of the victims of the Baoshan Road massacre, Cai Bingquan and Cai Shengtang, went to the bookbinding workers' union to report the tragic circumstances of their son's death and to request assistance in seeking justice. They presented the following demands: (1) the perpetrators must be executed on the spot, and those who aided and abetted the shooting must also be severely punished, and the property of the principal culprit, You Bolu, must be confiscated; (2) compensation must be provided, including (A) expenses for collecting the body, clothing, and coffins, (B) funeral expenses, transportation of the coffin back to the hometown, tomb construction, monument erection, etc., and miscellaneous expenses for funeral arrangements, (C) support for the four surviving relatives and the widow, as well as repayment of debts, and all post-mortem arrangements should be generously allocated. They requested that the union accompany them to the municipal government and party and government agencies to seek justice. At around 11:00 AM yesterday, representatives of the bookbinding union, Ren Fufu and Lu Jianqiu, accompanied Cai Bingquan, the father of the deceased Cai Yongfang, and Cai Shengtang, the uncle, and Sun Xin, the representative of the military uniform union, accompanied Shen, the mother of the deceased Shen Wanlin, to the municipal government to petition. Section Chief Yu of the Second Section received them. The two union representatives immediately stated their intentions. Section Chief Yu replied that the government was already handling the matter earnestly. The representatives asked whether the main culprit, You Bolu, and the shooting police officers were indeed being held at the local court. Section Chief Yu replied that they had indeed been sent to the court, and the investigation court was currently handling the matter. The government certainly valued human life. The union representatives repeatedly described the tragic deaths and the difficult circumstances of the victims' families, requesting the municipal government to expedite the conclusion of the case to console the living and redress the injustice of the dead, and also requested permission for the victims' families to meet with Section Chief Yu. Section Chief Yu replied that this was not necessary and that everyone could persuade and console the victims' families, as the case was already being handled by the court and would be concluded soon. The union representatives requested the municipal government to provide immediate relief, as the bodies were decaying and there was no money for coffins. The victims' families were in unbearable pain. Section Chief Yu replied that they needed to find ways to collect the bodies on their own, and that compensation would be provided generously afterward. If it was truly impossible, the Public Security Bureau would be ordered to collect the bodies. After discussions among the representatives and the victims' families, they all cried out that they did not want the Public Security Bureau to provide meager arrangements, and that the deaths were so tragic, how could anyone bear to let them be treated so shabbily after death? After repeated persuasion by the union representatives, the victims' families finally had to find ways to collect the bodies on their own, tearfully leaving.</p>
<p>Please Sentence You Bolu to Death After the Baoshan Road Massacre, the municipal government transferred You Bolu and six others to the court. Yang Wenxun, the prosecutor, has opened a preliminary hearing. Cai Bingquan, the father of the deceased Cai Yongfang, and Shen Yan, the mother of Shen Wanlin, have all been summoned to testify, jointly requesting that justice be served. Prosecutor Yang instructed them to submit additional written statements. Cai Bingquan, as his son was a worker in the bookbinding industry, went to the bookbinding workers' union after the court session to request assistance. The union introduced him to legal counsel Zhang Chongding, who was commissioned to act as Cai's agent for prosecution and incidental civil proceedings. Lawyer Zhang drafted a statement requesting that You Bolu be sentenced to death, and included incidental civil proceedings, requesting compensation of 32,000 yuan. The statement reads: "For instigating murder and disregarding human life, please punish severely according to the law. Regarding the incidental civil proceedings, at around 8:00 PM on the afternoon of this month, You Bolu, the chief of the fifth district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordered the police to open fire and shoot at the public, killing Cai Yongfang and another person on the spot. You Bolu and the police involved in the incident have been handed over to your court by the Municipal Public Security Bureau for handling. The situation on that day has been clarified by personnel dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Garrison Headquarters for investigation. The incident was witnessed by Feng Xiancheng and Yang Youren, members of the Sixth District Standing Committee. You Bolu's guilt is undeniable. Letters from the Municipal Supervisory Committee, labor representatives Lu Jingshi, and the bookbinding workers' union have been exchanged, urging severe punishment. The truth of the case is already clear. Your court's prosecutor, in determining the facts and citing legal provisions, has the authority to declare that people should wait for punishment and not disturb the process. However, given the near unanimous public opinion advocating for You Bolu's execution, and the fact that the declarant is the father of Cai Yongfang, the pain is so great that it cannot be expressed in words. It is believed that although You Bolu did not personally fire the gun, his repeated orders to fire constitute the elements of instigation under criminal law. The criminal law stipulates that instigators should be punished the same as the perpetrators. In this case, there were two deaths and five injuries, so You Bolu committed two counts of instigating murder and five counts of attempted instigating murder. Furthermore, Article 284, Section 2 of the same law stipulates that those who commit murder and engage in other cruel acts should be sentenced to death. During the incident, the onlookers were all unarmed, and firing a gun would only result in them being shot. Moreover, there was more than one onlooker, and there was no attempt to rush the district office. Police guns are intended to defend the people, but they were instead used to shoot unarmed and defenseless civilians. At the moment when You Bolu ordered the shooting, it was foreseen that there would be casualties and bloodshed. How can one say that this is not a cruel act? Therefore, it is requested that your court prosecute according to the law and sentence You Bolu to death. The defendants Lin Qingxiang, Wu Maolin, Liu Weicheng, Qiao Xuechang, and Lin Zhanyou, who were accomplices in the crime, should also be punished according to the law to uphold justice and console the dead souls. Furthermore, the declarant's son, Cai Yongfang, was 22 years old. If he had lived to 60 years old, he would have had 38 more years. Although his current monthly salary is only 30 yuan, if he had not died, his salary would have increased with seniority, and his future income would have been limitless. For the convenience of calculating damages, it is conservatively estimated that his monthly salary would have been 65 yuan, which would amount to over 30,000 yuan in 38 years. In addition, funeral expenses of 2,000 yuan would be required. Based on the above calculations, it is requested in the incidental civil proceedings that You Bolu and the defendants be jointly and severally liable for compensation of 32,000 yuan, so that the declarant's couple and widow Wu can have funds for their livelihood, weeping and urgently awaiting judgment. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Local Court by the declarant Cai Bingquan and the drafting lawyer Zhang Chongding."</p>

<p>Shanghai: Since its establishment, the Women's Group of the various provincial flood relief associations has spared no effort in raising relief funds. Among its planned activities, masquerade balls, public performances of Peking Opera, etc., were not realized. Only the calligraphy and painting exhibition initiated by the two committee members, Ms. Yu Danhan and Ms. Tang Guanyu, opened yesterday at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on the fourth floor of Tibet Road. Prior to the event, Ms. Yu and Ms. Tang collected numerous famous calligraphy and paintings from all walks of life and pre-issued 200 calligraphy and painting vouchers, each priced at fifty yuan, which were sold to kind-hearted individuals.

Ms. Yu and Ms. Tang also had several outstanding pieces on display. The rest of the collection was a dazzling array of beautiful works, exquisitely mounted, so that those who acquired them would not need to have them remounted. The exhibition is scheduled to last for three days, and on the afternoon of the 11th of this month at 3:00 PM, a lottery will be held on the spot, and ticket holders can claim the calligraphy and painting pieces. The most valuable ancient paintings are worth over a thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The Linberghs Telegraph Gratitude to the Flood Relief Association</p>

They flew to the disaster area for several days to inspect the situation and made great contributions. Now, the Linberghs sent telegrams from the Shanghai Maru to express their gratitude, and the contents are translated below: To Chairman Song of the Shanghai National Government Flood Relief Committee: We have received your letter with respect, and we are deeply grateful for your kindness. We hereby reply.</p>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association's Disaster Relief Efforts</p>

It is also successively establishing branches in Taixian, Dongtai, Xinghua, and Yancheng to actively provide relief. However, Vice President Gu Jisheng and Chairman Zhu Yinjiang of the Fundraising Committee are particularly concerned that the relief efforts are inadequate. Yesterday, they both embarked on a second trip to personally investigate the situation in Jiangbei and to supervise all relief operations. Individuals like Mr. Gu and Mr. Zhu are truly compassionate and rare. It is also heard that the first batch of cotton clothing from the association has already been shipped out, and another batch of new cotton clothing, sanitary shirts, and relief medicines will be shipped to various disaster areas, so that the disaster areas can avoid the lack of clothing.

<p>Public and Religious Figures Enthusiastically Help with Relief</p>
<p>Public and religious figures gathered last month in Xuhui to discuss disaster relief matters. Bishop Hu of Jiangnan personally attended the meeting, and Father Rao (Tfacguinct), a representative from the Wuhan Disaster Relief Committee, reported on the tragic situation he witnessed. It was then decided that the Xuhui Church would launch a lecture campaign, followed by fundraising. Members of various religious groups enthusiastically donated, and even impoverished workers willingly volunteered their spare time to provide services such as carrying supplies. Schools such as Qiming, Chongde, Xuhui Public School, and other schools in the parishes also actively donated. Female students donated clothing and materials, and sacrificed some of their leisure time to sew clothes and cotton garments. Even young students with some sewing skills were willing to participate. What is particularly commendable is that the young students of the Xuhui Workers' Children's School, the orphans of the nursery, and the blind people of the rehabilitation center, despite their poverty, demonstrated a spirit of sacrifice and mutual assistance. For example, a student eagerly handed over his only copper coins to the teacher in front of the school to be used as a donation, fearing that he would forget his good deed when he saw snacks. The orphans of the nursery also competed to donate the meager rewards they earned from handicrafts. One orphan, whose uncle came to visit him, gave him three dimes that he had not seen for a long time. Unexpectedly, he donated all the hard-earned and only copper coins as a donation. The orphans of the Tushan Orphanage also had similar touching acts. They donated many items of clothing and declared that if they had any savings, they would buy more to donate. Male and female servants from various places also generously donated money, or contributed items, or helped with wages. All these actions demonstrate that public and religious figures, regardless of their wealth, from top to bottom, are kind, generous, and willing to help others, demonstrating a true spirit of sacrifice and mutual assistance. The donated clothes and quilts are displayed in the reception room of the Sacred Heart Church, inspected by Father Shenfu of the Xuhui parish. There are over five thousand new and used clothes and six hundred new quilts, all handmade by students. The rest are washed, repaired, and sorted before being sent to the disaster area. It is heard that this campaign will continue with all efforts, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Yuyuan National Products Association Raises Funds for Relief</p>

Over two weeks, they raised 234.99 yuan in silver dollars and 133 yuan in small silver coins. Among them, Committee Member Chen Jishi was particularly enthusiastic and personally raised 118 yuan in silver dollars and 48 yuan in small silver coins. The funds have now been sent to the Emergency Relief Association, and part of the funds have been used to purchase 1,116 pounds of bread, which were sent to the No. 1 Reception Center for disaster victims in the city for distribution.</p>
<p>Chongming Disaster Victims Also Request Clothing</p>
<p>The Clothing Relief Association at 207 Ximendelan Road, Racecourse, received a letter yesterday from the Chongming Jisheng Association requesting a distribution of clothing to be transported to Chongming by Mr. Zhang Weiren. Huang Yazhou, the director of the association, considered that the disaster situation in Chongming seemed to be slightly lighter than in other provinces and decided to send 500 pieces to Chongming to show the difference. Yesterday, the association received over 1,100 pieces of clothing.</p>

<h3>Labor-Management Dispute at the Zhonghua Book Company</h3>
<p>Mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday Without Result</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters previously issued a notice to all trade associations and labor unions, requiring all labor-management disputes to be resolved within two weeks in order to achieve labor-management unity and jointly overcome national difficulties, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The labor-management dispute at the Zhonghua Book Company has been going on for several months and has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from both sides. The labor representatives were Yang Youren and others, but no official representative from the management attended, making negotiations inconvenient. As a result, there was no progress. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau will schedule another meeting for both sides to officially mediate.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Instruction</h3>
<p>Imitate the Production of Imported Cod Liver Oil</p>
<p>Shandong Shidao Has Abundant Raw Materials for This Oil</p>
<p>Also Issue a Copy of the Oil Production Method for Trial Production</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry yesterday instructed the Shanghai South City Chamber of Commerce to instruct Western medicine merchants to imitate the production of imported cod liver oil, stating: For the purpose of implementation, cod liver oil has been sold in the country for many years, and all of it is imported. The raw materials for this oil are abundant in Shidao, Shandong Province.</p>
<p>The livers of cod are originally discarded by fishermen after being salted and dried. Collecting the raw materials does not require much capital. Now that the fishing season is approaching, it is urgent to go and purchase the raw materials for imitation production, so as to revitalize domestic products and benefit from waste utilization. A copy of the cod liver oil production method is hereby issued, ordering the Chamber of Commerce to lead the Western medicine stores to organize a group to go to Shidao for trial production and to report the progress of the production for future verification. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has forwarded the order to the Shanghai New Cotton Medicine Trade Association for compliance.</p>
<h3>Students Returning from Japan Form Alumni Association</h3>

<h3>Ren Zhennan Arrested Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Anhui Students Express Determination</h3>

<h3>Agricultural Department Orders Silk Merchants to Pay Attention to Cocoon Prices</h3>
<p>A Passive Way to Address the Decline of the Silk Industry</p>
<p>The decline of China's silk export industry has reached its extreme. Although the government has issued bonds for relief, the exchange rate has fallen and the price of silk has fallen step by step. In addition, the current situation has affected the American market and suspended orders. Even if prices are cut for sale, there is no response. Even temporarily mortgaging silk to raise funds is difficult due to tight money. Therefore, at this critical moment, those who strive to maintain the work of silk factories must reduce costs. Otherwise, the future is dangerous and unimaginable. In view of this, the Ministry of Industry of the National Government has specially instructed the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining to instruct the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association, stating that the silk sales in recent years have been sluggish and the price of silk has fallen daily. Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have suffered heavy losses, with eight or nine out of ten being in the red. The government has issued public bonds to implement relief in order to continue operations. The reason for its losses, although due to the stagnation of foreign sales and the sharp drop in silk prices, the high cost of raw silk is also an important factor. In the cost of raw silk, the cocoon cost accounts for more than 75% and the labor cost accounts for less than 25%. Recently, the price of the best silk has been no more than 1,000 taels, and the price of the middle class is only more than 900 taels. The cocoon cost should not exceed 700 taels as a standard. Now that the autumn cocoons are on the market and the transaction is about to begin, the silk factories should carefully purchase cocoons in a cooperative manner according to the silk price and cocoon quality to stabilize the business. They must not compete for purchases or arbitrarily lower prices, resulting in an irreversible situation in the future. In addition to sub-orders, the factory is ordered to immediately inform all the silk factories under its jurisdiction to comply. This order.</p>
<h3>Foreign Goods Marked with</h3>
<p>Stamps Indicating Country of Origin</p>
<p>University Students Request Municipal Party Headquarters to Inform Customs to Handle This, According to the Daily News</p>
<p>University students, in view of the fact that it is not easy for Chinese people to identify Japanese goods and it is difficult to avoid mispurchases, yesterday specially requested the Municipal Party Headquarters to present to the National Government an order to instruct customs officers in various places to stamp all imported foreign goods with a mark indicating the country of origin in order to facilitate identification.</p>
<h3>Gansu Incident News from Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Gansu Incident occurred before the national crisis. This matter concerns the overall situation in the Northwest and is valued by those who care about the country. A reporter from the New Times met yesterday with a certain important person in this port. According to reports, Xi Ma from Qinghai telegraphed to Director Yang Hucheng, planning to go to Lanzhou in person to mediate the disputes between Lei Zhongtian and Ma (Hongbin) in Gansu Province. Representatives from various parts of Gansu Province also sent representatives to Shaanxi to request Director Yang Hucheng to quickly handle the Gansu situation to relieve the suffering of the people. Yang Hucheng bears heavy responsibilities in the Northwest and is extremely supported by the people of Gansu. He will surely be able to reach a satisfactory solution in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Prevention Report from the Seaport Quarantine Station</h3>
<p>The National Seaport Quarantine Station issued its tenth report on the prevention of cholera, stating: (1) Yu (Wu Liande, referring to himself) returned to Shanghai on October 6 after inspecting the situation in the Wuhan disaster area. Although there were cases of true cholera in Wuchang and Hankou, especially among the victims, it was not very severe. During this epidemic, the death toll was only 300 out of a population of one million, including 80,000 victims living in sheds. Therefore, I feel that the epidemic prevention work of the Flood Relief Committee is very satisfactory. (2) As far as Shanghai is concerned, the cholera situation has eased in the past week (ending October 3). According to Shanghai's report, there were 30 new cases and 7 deaths. There were 24 patients and 6 deaths in the Public Concession, and 5 patients and 2 deaths in the French Concession. According to last week's report, there were a total of 59 patients and 15 deaths. (3) For anti-cholera injections, health agencies in various places are still implementing them as usual. According to the September report, the numbers are as follows: 54,85 people in Shanghai, 22,699 people in the Public Concession, and 12,606 people in the French Concession. Adding these numbers to those injected previously, a total of 747,526 people have been injected from May 1 to September 30. (4) There have been recent outbreaks of plague in the following locations: A. Between South Manchuria, Chun and Kaitong (the area recently seized by Japan). B. Lin County, Shanxi (near Shaanxi) also has a local epidemic of plague. C. Nanyang and Deng County, Henan. According to the reports from Nanyang and Deng County, Henan, where there has been no plague in the past, nearly a hundred people have died of the disease. Once the investigation is confirmed, it will be disclosed again. The office has now dispatched technical health personnel to investigate and implement suppression work when necessary. (5) Nanjing and Hankou have implemented quarantine work for travelers to Shanghai. Therefore, shipmen to and from Wusong in the previous month were strictly quarantined, but this procedure may be eased soon.</p>
<h3>Dockworkers' Union</h3>
<p>No Need for Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters Approved Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dockworkers' Union Rectification Committee, in view of the fact that the violent Japanese army is unprovokedly using troops to invade the East Province, convened representatives from various docks to discuss and decided to establish a city-wide anti-Japanese and national salvation association for dockworkers. Twenty-seven people, including Wu Jiazawa, were elected as newspaper members on the spot and submitted to the Municipal Executive Committee for record. It is heard that the Municipal Executive Committee believes that the organization of the group has not been handled in accordance with the law beforehand, and that dockworkers already have an organization of trade unions. All anti-Japanese and national salvation work can be handled by the trade unions. There is no need to organize it again. It has been approved and disallowed.</p>

Therefore, the library has recently carried out a reorganization plan, setting rules and classifying books, and sparing no effort. It has also purchased dozens of volumes on Japanese studies, Northeast issues, and the international situation. Other publications such as the Daily News, China Review Weekly, National Weekly, Current Affairs Monthly, and Humanities Magazine are also available. In order to meet the urgent needs of all sectors of society during the national crisis, it will be open at 1:00 PM on National Day. All sectors of society are welcome to visit and read.

After receiving the letter, the police dispatched officers for days to prohibit all vendors from setting up stalls from Baixin Kaihe to Xiaobei Men. The vendors were alarmed and panicked, claiming that the Public Security Bureau's request to the police to ban them was tantamount to putting thousands of vendors in a desperate situation. Moreover, at a time of natural disasters and man-made calamities, when people are struggling to survive, how can we add unwarranted restrictions? Therefore, the public is in an uproar. They have now submitted a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting that their livelihoods be maintained and plan to appeal to various organizations for assistance.</p>

<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<h3>Kunlun Shanren's Message (Shanghai Must Be Cautious When Dealing With Japan)</h3>
<p>The brutality of the Japanese aggressors against us in Shenyang, Jilin, and other places in the three northeastern provinces is proof that all humans are filled with hatred and are eager to fight to the death with the inhuman Japanese imperialists. Therefore, all countries in the world have expressed great sympathy for our peace-loving Chinese nation. Shanghai, as our country's largest commercial port, is where the spirit of the whole country gathers. Therefore, whenever there are floods or droughts in various provinces, Shanghai is the only place people rely on. Every time there is a military uprising, all military expenses are provided by Shanghai. Recently, an accident occurred at the Zhabei Fifth District Office, and people are very uneasy. Moreover, Japan has dispatched warships to Shanghai, causing rumors to spread. All these situations are brewed from extremely small actions. Our country's resistance to Japan is nothing more than shouting slogans, holding meetings and parades, and, at most, inspecting Japanese goods. However, Japan's actions towards us are different. The three northeastern provinces have already been occupied, and countless compatriots have been killed, not to mention the confiscation of private property. Now that the troops have not yet been withdrawn, they dare to dispatch warships to China in large numbers. From Japan's perspective, the intention is to protect overseas Chinese. However, there may be other motives behind the scenes. Now that our country is not yet unified domestically, we cannot fight them. During this period, all propaganda must be carried out to the fullest extent. However, simply putting up slogans and holding demonstrations and parades is not the way to go. (Most of the slogan paper is made in Japan, which is lamentable.) It is hoped that the gentlemen of the commercial and academic circles will remain calm and not take any actions that go beyond the bounds, so as not to create opportunities for reactionary elements. Alas, the government's approach to Japan should be followed. The people of a country are like a family, fathers, sons, and brothers. If an unexpected event happens to a family and they are bullied, the father or brother will come forward to reason. As a son, one should listen to the father and brother and not make a ruckus, lest one be used by others. The situation in the country is similar. During the Spring and Autumn period, the state of Wu treated the state of Yue with extreme humiliation. "Ten years of reproduction, ten years of education, and in twenty years, Wu will be a swamp." "Fucha, have you forgotten that the people of Yue killed your father?" This shows that the way our ancient country sought revenge was never like today's practice of putting up irresponsible slogans to show patriotism. If one has the determination to be patriotic, it must not be expressed in words but should be manifested in actions. Adopting the story of King Yue Goujian tasting gall while lying on firewood, all sectors of industry, commerce, and academia should unite to do whatever work, whatever duties, and not stop until they succeed. They should also study countermeasures, such as exercising the body, promoting the creation of factories, manufacturing domestic goods, and forming volunteer armies, in preparation for the future decisive battle. If we can unite as one and not be a five-minute fad, I dare to say that we will definitely defeat Japan. Heaven has not let me down. Back then (around the sixth or seventh year of the Republic), I created Invincible Tooth Powder without shouting or yelling. Now, all the so-called Gangshi Tooth Powder in various provinces and cities has long disappeared. From this alone, we can know other things. I have always said that I am not afraid that China will not be strong, but I am only afraid that the Chinese people will not be ambitious. I am a small person with insignificant words, knowing that I cannot help the current crisis. However, since the brutal Japanese occupied our Liaoning and Jilin, I cannot eat well or sleep well. My concern for the country grows day by day. Seeing the current situation in Shanghai, we must be extremely cautious. If something happens, the southeastern half of the country will be devastated. I pray that this will be published in your newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your opinion is crucial and will be published immediately.</p>
<h3>Jiang Xiaobo's Message (Exposing Methods of Smuggling Japanese Goods in the Interior)</h3>
<p>I am a shop assistant in the foreign goods industry. At this critical moment of the country's survival, I have some understanding of the idea of saving the country. It is rare to have the opportunity to send reader correspondence in the newspaper. I dare to announce to the people of the country the methods used by my industry to smuggle Japanese goods, hoping that the agencies responsible for inspecting Japanese goods will expose their dark secrets. Nine out of ten foreign goods businesses sell Japanese goods. Therefore, whenever there is a boycott of Japanese goods, the tighter the inspection in Jiangnan, the more smuggling there is in Jiangbei. The only way to smuggle is to lobby the local officials and letter carriers. Taking the three counties of Yancheng, Xinghua, and Taixian as an example, it is estimated that more than 50,000 yuan worth of Japanese goods are smuggled every day. They always have regular customers. Whenever there is a boycott of Japanese goods, they always rush to import them, even buying up a year's worth of Japanese goods, piling them up in Shanghai, and then slowly smuggling them through the post office by changing them into parcels. Before they are sent, the agents telegraph us, telling us the fake store number we are using, such as "某某". After receiving the telegram, this store lobbies the post office, offering them a hefty reward and declaring that "某某" is our store's number. Therefore, it has never been discovered. Even if it is accidentally discovered, since there is no real number, there is no way to investigate. However, the goods are simply confiscated. Sometimes, if they are discovered by inspectors, they also have ways to deal with it, which is to transport the parcels to the countryside and store them in foreign goods stores in the rural towns. Then, they issue many invoices and teach the foreign goods stores in the rural towns to return them to the inspectors according to the invoices. The inspectors can do nothing about it. There are also those who ship goods at night and those who transport goods using luggage. There are various different tricks. Due to space limitations, I cannot list them all. I pray that it will be disclosed in the reader correspondence column for the authorities to refer to, which may also contribute to saving the country.</p>
<p>(Reply) It will be published immediately.</p>
<h3>Yi Huai Zeng's Message</h3>
<p>At this time when the call for non-cooperation is at its highest, there is a kind of difficulty that makes patriots unable to implement it, which is that when shopping, it is not easy to distinguish which are enemy goods and which are domestic goods. Now there is a method, that is, when we buy goods, we ask the store to affix the following statement on the invoice: "This store guarantees that the goods sold on this invoice are definitely not Japanese goods. If there is any deception and it is found out, we are willing to be fined ten times the total value of the goods on this invoice. [Store Name] [Seal] [Salesperson's Signature]" This method (A) allows patriots to purchase daily necessities without being deceived, and (B) allows patriotic merchants to express their patriotism further. For stores that have adopted this method, we should do our best to promote them. For the sake of business, many merchants will follow suit.</p>
<p>(Reply) Very good, it will be published.</p>

<h3>Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>— Xiaotong</p>
<p>Since Japanese imperialism, under the pretext of the Nakamura Incident, dispatched troops to the eastern provinces, forcibly occupied our Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, Fushun, and other places, burned down institutions, destroyed railways, shot people, looted shops, detained military and political officials, and confiscated military and police firearms, committing unprecedented atrocities in the world in order to realize its dream of a continental policy, popular sentiment has been aroused. Anyone with blood and spirit cannot tolerate this extraordinary humiliation. The call for resisting Japan and saving the country has stirred up the masses of the whole country. At this critical juncture of national survival, the organization of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has become a task that brooks no delay.</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, youth students once broke out, but due to being bound by various controls, they lost the opportunity to act. However, youth students are all full of vigor and emotion. Any kind of stimulation can arouse their cries and struggles. What's more, this time, the brutal Japanese sent troops to the eastern provinces and forcibly occupied our country's territory, which is an extraordinary humiliation. The courage of the students has been restored, the spirit of the students in the past has been revived, and the organization of the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has been started and is already working in all schools. This can truly be said to be a period of revival for the student movement. Indeed, at this time when the country is in trouble, young people who are in a position of being late to realize the situation should be working so enthusiastically for the country. Even sacrificing for the country is worthwhile.</p>
<p>The education in schools has not yet achieved a considerable position and honor. The biggest reason is that the age of the schools is immature and the students of the schools have little contact with the masses. This extraordinary humiliation is vividly presented before the students. The students, surrounded by the environment, broke the silence and first organized the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, risking their youth and courage, and mustered their spirits to enthusiastically carry out the anti-Japanese work for the survival of the country. On the one hand, they telegraphed to advocate the speedy recovery of the occupied areas by revolutionary means, and organized a national salvation volunteer army, training day and night, to act as the government's support. On the other hand, they are doing the following work: teams are going to nearby people to do publicity, in order to arouse the people and resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>Indeed, the greatest work of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is still at the grassroots level, because everyone knows that most of the people in our country, except for a few who can understand national affairs, are almost all asleep. The people are the backing of the government. At this critical juncture of national survival, if we do not arouse the people and unite to resist foreign aggression, how can the government use what means to redress this extraordinary humiliation?</p>
<p>Now, Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations have been established one after another. The work of the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is proceeding enthusiastically, but we must not neglect it. The greatest work of the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is still to go to the grassroots level and to the people.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Will</h3>
<p>— Minyin</p>
<p>It's dawn. Qian, who studies in the junior high school department of Nanyang High School of Commerce, got up very early. Qian, who usually gets up very late, suddenly got up especially early today. In the eyes of Qian's generally stupid little friends, it was very strange. Who knew that the heart of the naive Qian had been covered with fog, sadness, and a fog-like melancholy. At the same time, hidden in this net of sorrow and melancholy, was the most intense will. That will was born from his "patriotic enthusiasm." The thing is like this: Since Qian saw the news in the Shen Bao that "Japanese soldiers occupied Liaoning," he had lost interest in everything. In normal times, he liked to play ball and swim, but now he was thinking all day long, as if some terrible fate was about to befall him. He thought every day about how to resist Japan. He thought that his age was not suitable for starting a war. To start a war with the Japanese would be tantamount to sending himself to his death. How could his two tender hands that could not hold knives and guns fight? He kept thinking. Since he was not able to realize his first wish, then what should he do? Since he was one of the citizens of China, would he stand by and watch the dwarfs occupy our territory and massacre our compatriots? That was absolutely intolerable. He thought, if he were to do this and live a "drunken life and dream death," then he would rather die. So, he came up with a second plan.</p>
<p>It was already seven o'clock. The sun was spinning in the sky, shooting out red rays of light. The net of dawn was also gradually shrinking. Qian, with patriotic enthusiasm, stepped on the sun on the ground, and the blood in his heart was as red as the sunlight. He walked excitedly, thinking. He thought of "The Last Lesson" from the Franco-Prussian War. He thought of the prosperity of the people's strong national consciousness at that time in France. He seemed to see a scene from the Franco-Prussian War: blood-stained corpses, the cries of the people, and the teacher's words of warning to the students were all powerful, stimulating, and profound. At the same time, the students' quick understanding and moved attitudes were all expressed very clearly, especially the touching expressions displayed by the elementary school students, which really made our country's education community ashamed. He thought that China would inevitably have a day when there would be no Chinese writing to read. He thought that he was a student of China, the future master of China, and should shoulder a greater "mission," even a "mission" of bloodshed, a "mission" of bloodshed for the entire nation. Thinking of these emotions, he became even more excited and excited. He reviewed the speech and propaganda he would give to the people.</p>
<p>He unconsciously stepped over his school, Nanyang High School of Commerce. His consciousness made him move forward and not go in as usual. His consciousness made him know that his duty today was much greater than going to school and reading books, greater than anything else. He strode forward and headed for his destination.</p>
<p>It was almost eight o'clock. The people in the Yokohama Road area were all buying vegetables. Red and green vegetable baskets were carried over and back by the hawkers on their shoulders. Many young women were selecting various vegetables.</p>
<p>Our young Qian, who was full of patriotic enthusiasm, took the opportunity to run into the crowd, stepped onto a long bench, and began to speak.</p>
<p>"Fellow compatriots, do you know what day it is today? Today is one of the most dangerous days in the date when our country is being slaughtered and ravaged by the brutal Japanese. Haven't you already known about the actions of the Japanese in the Liaoning area? Haven't you already seen the photos of the compatriots who were bleeding, the compatriots who died tragically, which make people cry and make people indignant? I think, if you have a little patriotism, if you know that you are the people of China, not the people of other countries, I think you must already know it, you must have shed tears, you must have the determination to fight. But, it is not an empty determination that will be effective. It requires our long-term endurance, hard work, and perseverance to fight, each of us to take on the work we can take on to fight, fight, fight..."</p>
<p>When he spoke the six words "fight, fight, fight," he spoke with clenched teeth. In his very loud and clear voice, there seemed to be an awareness of crying. At the same time, this crying sound was not tender and weak, it was positive.</p>
<p>The general people were all moved by his impassioned speech, and they stood and listened. They felt that the words of this fifteen- or sixteen-year-old student were very moving, far surpassing the general "perfunctory" speeches. Although his words were simple, every sentence was powerful, every sentence was revealed from hot blood. They felt that China now needed such young people. They hoped that every young person would be like him, have a brain, have insight, and be consciously assimilated, and they themselves felt that it was extremely shameful for them not to take on the work they could take on.</p>
<p>After Qian's speech, he wiped the sweat on his forehead and went home.</p>
<p>He clearly heard several people sincerely say, "Students like this year have the will to resist Japan."</p>
<h3>Military Drill</h3>
<p>— Bing She</p>
<h3>Dirge</h3>
<p>— Xiaoguang</p>
<p>It seemed to be around three o'clock in the deep night. My classmates were sleeping like steamed buns, emitting "hissing" snores. Suddenly, an alarming sound came from who knows where. I lazily peeked my head out in the dormitory, filled with terrifying darkness, and listened intently. That strange and frightening sound finally gradually drew closer. "Oh my, what's going on?" A gloomy and somber atmosphere tightly enveloped me, so afraid that I had to swallow the words that slipped to my lips. Although it was early summer in May, the cold of the deep night was still hard to bear. I stared at the window as if nailed to it for about half an hour.</p>
<p>In the sky, in that distant sky, patches of dark clouds obscured the radiant moonlight, and a thick black curtain descended upon the earth. "Perhaps this symbolizes an omen of tonight's unfortunate events," I couldn't help but wonder.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the electric light flickered on. Borrowing a bit of courage from the light, I gently pushed my roommate, Mr. Ying.</p>
<p>"Old Ying, get up quickly, get up quickly... The electric light must be acting up, suddenly turning on at this late hour. Maybe it's caught a thief..."</p>
<p>Although I said this, I was still worried that something unfortunate would befall us immediately. "Ah... what, what time is it?" Mr. Ying rubbed his sleepy eyes and looked at me in surprise.</p>
<p>"It's probably a little past three o'clock, Old Ying. Something is definitely happening tonight. Otherwise, why would the light turn on at this hour? Don't sleep, let's just drag Old Chen up too, and let's all go investigate."</p>
<p>Thus, the three of us, each harboring unnamed fears, tightly held hands and quietly left the dormitory.</p>
<p>"Scrub, scrub, scrub... Sook, sook, sook..." The sounds came towards us.</p>
<p>"Oh no, it's soldiers, this is no joke, let's go back..." I was so scared I could barely speak, desperately pulling the hands of Mr. Ying and Mr. Chen. They were indeed trembling there.</p>
<p>"Quickly pack your luggage." Just as the three of us sat on the edge of the bed, hearts pounding, two soldiers with loaded guns entered. They heavily, as if giving a command during martial law, shouted, and monitored our actions with their fierce faces.</p>
<p>I was frightened, and my limbs were like broken bones as I trembled and began to pack my luggage and scattered books. "Hurry, it's getting late, it's already past four o'clock."</p>
<p>One of the soldiers rummaged through my bookshelf, perhaps he was impatient with the rummaging, and that's why he was urging us.</p>
<p>The air was very restless. Obviously, the students in each room were making a cacophony of disorganized sounds as they packed their luggage.</p>
<p>"You immediately move your luggage to the school gate, then go to the office – actually, the office – to collect travel expenses of ten yuan," they said before leaving.</p>
<p>"Ah, so this is how they're dealing with us... Well, they're even giving us ten yuan for travel expenses, this is truly 'compassionate' and 'charitable',"</p>
<p>I said to them, but a layer of pale white smiles had already spread across their faces.</p>
<p>Before dawn, we, over a hundred students, along with our luggage, were crammed into cars and sped off towards an unknown destination. Thus, a life of wandering unfolded before me... On the second day of being expelled, I dragged my heavy body to Jiangwan. Here, I must thank Mrs. Wang, the landlady, for her generous heart, because she took pity on our group's unfortunate circumstances and allowed several of us students to live there without charging any rent. Furthermore, she even subscribed to a newspaper for us. How could we not be deeply grateful?</p>
<p>I pore over the recruitment ads in the newspaper every day, but they always bring me great disappointment. Disappointment is, after all, disappointment, and is there any way to remedy it? Although I temporarily have a place to stay, it will only be for a very short time. What will I do with myself in the future? Thinking about this question, I felt lost.</p>
<p>Two weeks later,</p>
<p>Life is becoming more impoverished day by day, and I feel even more pain in my spirit. In this unfamiliar city of Shanghai, even to be</p>
