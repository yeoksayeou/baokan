<p>本報以一八七二年即清同治十一年壬申始創。明歲一九三二年又逢壬申。歲月不居。忽忽已六十周年。瞻前顧後。是不可以無紀念。乃於今日起劃此一年度爲紀念年。</p>
<p>所謂不可無紀念者何。</p>
<p>吾人試回首六十年以前之世界何如。其時西方則蘇彝士河初通。列强方競向海外尋覓殖民地。東方則日本纔上維新之路。其在世界尚無足重輕。而今則何如者。以此六十年之變化。準此演進速度。推測今後世界又將何如者。</p>
<p>吾人試又回首六十年以前之中國何如。其時列强已敲破我靜寂之門戶。要求互市通商。且競以不平等條約束縛我民族。遠識之士。初談洋務。有清之國運雖衰。國人尙牢囿於專制政治之下。而今則何如者。以此六十年之變化。準此演進速度。推測今後中國。又將何如者。</p>
<p>迴溯以往。皆爲陳跡。歷史上之新頁。正賡續依次展開。本報爲國内新聞紙中之成立較早者。在過去六十年歷史演進之洪流中。是否曾盡有一分推轉之力。爲功爲罪。非本報同人今日所願計及。獨是在今後繼續展開之新史頁中。本報究應如何以肩荷此社會先驅推進時代之重責。如何使社會進入合理之常軌。如何使我民族臻於興盛與繁榮。是則本報同人在六十年後之今日。所鄭重深自體念而不敢絲毫放鬆者。</p>
<p>念之則如何。以積極之行動。努力於本報之改進努力於應負之責任。不徘徊。不推諉。不畏縮。盡我棉薄。期有以自效。是爲本報同人深自體念後最大之决心。</p>
<p>請一言本報今後所欲自效者。</p>
<p>一科學爲人類探尋幸福之鎖鑰。科學發逹之程度。與人類享受幸福之分量。實爲向同一方面發展。之兩平行綫。歐美列國以及近鄰之日本。科學發展。人民都克享受物質文明之幸福。獨地大物博民衆之我國。至今尙淹滯於十九世紀之文化殘軌。人已風馳電掣而前邁。我則追望後塵而莫及。寳盈藏野。不知所取。貨殖委地。不知所用。彼科學發逹之列强。復挾其物質之文明以臨我。自然界之災禍。更逞其暴力以迫我。國家乃以貧困。民生乃以凋敝。禍亂相尋。因基於此。今後本報當盡力宣揚。以科學新知識介紹於國人。鼓勵研究興趣。以促其進步。更鼓吹建設。務使中國進入近世科學世界之領域。建設一嶄新之社會與國家　二。文化爲社會上層之建築。其基礎厥爲經濟。人類之一切活動。都以經濟爲中心。近世產業革命以後。世界經濟。已打成一片。任何一國經濟激起微波。其影響於世界者。即爲彼鳴此應之巨浪。政治之變幻以此。戰爭之爆發以此。殖民地之被宰割亦以此。吾人日處於世界經濟之大網羅中。日處於以經濟爲中心之變幻政局中。尤其是日處於經濟落後。横被列强蹂躪宰割之次殖民地中其於世界經濟之現狀及其轉捩。必應有以明瞭其現實。而斷測其將來。今後本報當努力陳述世界之經濟情勢。解剖我國經濟之特質。供大衆之探討。以求得我國家應走之前路。</p>
<p>三。目前呈現於吾人眼簾之現象。無一不爲極嚴重之社會問題。敎育之未能普及農工商之病態化。失業羣衆之加多。盜匪之蜂起。凡此潛伏之問題。一日不得解决。國家與社會。即一日不得安定其秩序。今後本報當從矛盾之現象中。探求諸問題之癥結。並求所以正當解决之道。使社會步入正軌。民生趨於安定　四。革命而後。凡百待理。種種政治上之施設。都亟有待於政府與國民之通力合作。盪滌積弊興舉新政。拔除舊社會之根基。播植新社會之萌芽。尤有待於政府與國民之携手同進。在此艱鉅之過程中。政府固應時時虚懷以採納輿論。國民則更應知所以了解政治。認識本身之職責。今後本報當以極摰誠之態度。對政府盡輿論之蒭蕘。對國民盡貢獻之責任。</p>
<p>五。青年爲未來社會之中堅。感覺敏銳。情緒熱烈。意志純正處於社會秩序不安定之現代。青年乃飽罹苦痛。學不得學業不得業。流離輾轉。爲世詬病。四顧茫然。渺無所依。近數年來苦悶呻吟。銷沉厭世之青年羣衆。何莫非我國家此日之元氣。他年之砥柱。此種現象。誠爲我國家無可補償之損失。今後本報願與青年作誠意之商討。願爲青年探路之良友。相携以共進於健全純潔勇敢進取奮鬥之坦途。</p>
<p>六。近年以來。（到邊疆去）之呼聲。常盈於吾人之耳鼓。實則大江以南。黄河以北。民苦擁擠。今無殊昔。東北西北。荒地萬里。無人耕種今亦仍前。坐使大好山河。啟强鄰之覬觎。國内民食。苦無自給。今後本報當探討移民殖邊之實施計劃與方案。并力加鼓吹。促其實行。</p>
<p>七。不平等條約爲束縛我民族生命之桎梏。爲列强宰制我國家强有力之工具。近百年來我國家淪於次殖民地位而末由振拔。即以不平等條約束縛之故。山河之割讓。主權之喪失。國民生命之横遭强暴者蹂躪。即如濟南之慘劇。最近萬寳山事件及日韓之虐殺我僑胞。何莫非不平等條約爲其階厲。不平等條約一日不廢除。我國家我民族即一日末由振起。我國民即一日末由脫離痛苦之深淵。今後本報當力求使國人知彼。并使自知。同時使其知彼而愈以自知。以求奮發我民族之偉力。鎚碎束縛我生命自由之枷鎖。而躋我國家民族於自由平等之地位。</p>
<p>凡此種種。皆本報今後所樹以爲努力之鵠的。願從紀念六十周年始。聚精會神。以求自見以求自效。且冀因是以獲當世賢哲之指導與扶助焉。</p>

<p>淹没田屋無數</p>
<p>災民逹數十萬</p>
<p>重慶通訊、川省本年自入夏以來、霪雨纏綿、山洪暴發、各江水勢陡漲、濱河各縣、幾成澤國淹没農田、冲塌房屋、以致沿岸住居之貧民小商、桱棲身失、所生活無路、呼籲求賑之聲、日有所聞、茲將各地災况、概述如次、</p>
<p>成都自八月一日大雨、降至次日始止、城外地勢低窪處早被水淹、南門上中蓮池地方、水深二尺有餘、南門城洞、水深過膝、外南龍王廟至青年宫附近、沿途田禾及大道、均被淹没、城内水量、各街巷亦積水過膝、三日復大雨傾盆、連綿數日、城内各街又一變而爲澤國、冲塌房屋、淹斃人民日必數起、城中各商店、皆呈蕭條景象、米販則乘機操縱米價、每斗竟售洋三元餘、多數中產階級、及改爲每日食麥麵一餐、貧苦居民、僅以南瓜茄子等菜蔬果腹而已、</p>
<p>重慶本市每值夏季、河水必漲、然旋漲旋退、水勢亦小損失頗輕、惟本年自八月一日起、揚子與嘉陸兩江、即往上漲、至五日深夜忽暴漲、沿江居住之人民、未及防備、房屋及糧食器具等、俱被淹没、男女亦有溺斃者、事後調查、計難民共有五百餘戶、約有三千餘人、</p>
<p>瀘縣自八月三日後、兩江水勢陡漲、極目汪洋、被難災民、得紅會救濟、死亡尙少、現紅會致電各方乞賑、電文略云、瀘濱兩江之交、三四兩日、上游水勢陡漲、附城如順城街及楷杷溝一帶、并對岸之小市廂、概成澤國、水漲甚驟、遷避無所、城垣之上、災民麕集、啼飢之慘、耳不忍聞、本會目擊心傷、趕速組織救護隊出發、分頭救護、大江救生船四隻、小江救生船三隻、員丁晝夜不停、救護人民約百餘口、現值暑假期中、各校正當停課、派員接洽、以瀘縣縣立中學校·縣立高等小學校·瀘縣公學·瀘縣模範小學校·爲災民臨時收容所、一面趕造麵餅、并煑稀粥、分散災黎、惟是水災奇重、爲近數十年所罕見、即以近城而論、已屬待振孔殷、重以濱江各鄕、如宜民忠侯崇義伏龍會文里仁鳳里、禾稻未登、梁菽正熟、概被淹没、人民何以爲生、伏冀分撥巨欵、下縣散賑、庶就槁之木、得以更生、涸轍之魚、得以再起、胥出仁人之賜也云云、</p>
<p>内江富順自八月初旬、沱江上游洪水暴漲數丈、水勢洶湧、由資中縣之蘇家灣·銀山鎭·田溪口·吏家街·以迄内江　木鎭·白馬廟·石灰溪·龍門鎭·牛佛渡·獅子灘·而至富順城·李家灣·黄葛堡·枇杷塲·趙化鎭·通灘·鰱魚洞、濱江兩岸、田士房屋、均被水冲毁、沿江只見狂波怒浪、房頂及高樹巔上所伏之男女、呼救之聲、慘不忍聞、但因巨浪狂瀾、救生船不能近、故被救者甚少、至財物及禾稻、隨波冲流、沿江俱是、計淹斃人數逹萬餘左右、冲去民房數千家、財產損失逹數百萬、稻田淹毁逹數十萬畝、誠空前之浩刦也、</p>
<p>合川本縣自八月初旬、大雨不止、河水暴漲七八丈、水勢之大、爲十數年來所未有、兩岸農產被冲刷者、逹百餘里、房屋被淹没者、逹千餘家、農民扶老携幼、紛紛赴附近鄕鎭避難、縣中人士、正設法振濟、至城區近河各街、人民受災更鉅、當水漲時、居民多拆卸房屋、向城内遷移、有拆卸不及被水淹没及冲去者、約有數十家、溺斃人民、約有五十餘名、</p>
<p>潼川八月二日起連續大雨潼江水漲不已、濱河居民及兩岸田禾、均被淹没、損失甚鉅、現縣中各機關正組織救災會、調查被災難民、以便設法救濟、</p>
<p>江津八月四五兩日、大雨連綿、江水暴漲、沿江一帶民房、幾完全淹没、以致一般貧民小商、棲身無所、生活無路呌天呼地、其况至慘商會特設法救濟、每日旋粥二次、並向各方乞賑、以救此次遇水災之貧民、</p>
<p>資中資陽八月三日起、沱江水勢陡漲、資中資陽兩縣沿河十餘村鎭、計二百餘里、均被水淹没、盡變澤國、漂毁田地房屋禾稼牲畜及用具等無算、内中如熟谷一項、未楊花及正楊花者、概成白穗、至各種雜糧、則皆已枯萎、更屬無望、淹斃居民數萬口、兩縣人士雖亟謀救濟、惟杯水車薪、無濟於事、</p>
<p>遂寗本縣爲四川小盆地、涪江貫通其間、每值夏秋之季、江水一發、沿河兩岸、常苦水患、然均不甚鉅、損失尙微、不意本年八月初旬霪雨不止、涪江水勢暴漲、城内水深數尺、沿岸田禾及房屋被淹没者、不可勝計、即以縣城而論、已冲堨房屋百餘處、淹没人民四十餘名、</p>
<p>以上所述、雖僅十餘縣、然區域已遍川省、災民亦逹數十萬之鉅、損失田禾財產無數、川民值兵災匪禍苛稅之餘、復罹水災、誠空前之浩刦也、（八月十七日）</p>

<h3 id="c97">六十 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>人們活到了六十歲。固然可算老了。在現代一般新青年的眼光中看來。就得駡一聲（老而不死）。而高唱打倒的口號。但是。我以爲不然。我要給老年人打不平。我要替老年人提出反抗。姑以青年人與老年人作比較。試問那一個的經騐較爲宏富。那一個的理智較爲充足。那一個的世故人情較爲明瞭。新青年聽了這話。一定不服氣。反唇相稽道。（老年人即使經騐宏富。理智充足。比較的明瞭世故人情。然而精力就衰。還能做甚麽事啊。）我說。（這又不然。古往今來的中外歷史上。很有不少以老年而成大事業的。即如近代歐洲大戰中的名將。如法之福煦。霞飛。英之海格。德之興登堡。他們戮力疆塲。爲國宣勞。都已年在六十以外。而美國大發明家安迪生年登耄耋。不是還在孜孜兀兀地發明出新事物來麽。他們不但是（老而不死）并且是（老當益壯。）</p>
<p>人生六十已滿了一個花甲子。自六十一歲起就。好似返老爲童。變做一個初生的嬰兒了。種種的重任。期待他去擔荷。種種的大業期待他去建立。他的錦繡殷的前途。眞是未可限量。今天是本報六十周紀念的第一日它。也好似返老爲童。變做一個初生的嬰兒一般。而一方面仍不以老而懈怠。仗著大刀闊斧。斬荆除棘的奮鬥下去。我即以（老而不死）（老當益壯）二語祝頌它的長壽。</p>
<h3 id="c98">記日本首相濱口事 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 王沿津</p>
<p>日本前首相濱口雄幸氏民政黨總裁也。爲政興革。立論新奇。爲彼邦民衆所崇仰。奈世界潮流所趨日本不景氣狀態。有無減。失業者亦日衆。而若輩皆遷怨於氏。氏於是遇剌於東京驛。雖未當塲斃命。然六旬老翁。何能受此大創。延至八月二十六日。竟以逝世聞同學松田勇次郎。係氏妻夏子之愛甥。得悉氏之情狀甚詳。課餘偶或道及。追記之以實本談。</p>
<p>幼年時代　氏父義立。爲日本維新先進治子甚嚴。然氏童性好玩。怠於學業。雖屢加訓斥。亦難收效義立憂之。會其家鄕小石川久世山。連年欠收。附近居民。咸入氏門爲清客。依之爲生。某農人有子焉。年幼好學。義立器重之立爲義子。以華衣衣之。美食食之。氏則反衣其遺褐。食其餘粟。形容憔悴。心殊不甘。哭謂母曰。父何寵彼而棄我耶。母曰。有子如爾不如無有。氏從此回頭。專心攻讀。按步遞進。竟得成就。不可謂非歸功於庭訓也</p>
<p>求學時代　氏求學於帝國大學政治科。平日未嘗涉臘政治學之書籍。然終日埋首於圖書館者。皆在揣摩中國史與西洋史也同學或詢之。則不稍自秘滔滔對曰。歷史即政治。亦即以前之政治。我曹研究政治學者。當先明以前之政治。附證以現代之政治。然後得產生未來之政治。其見識之卓越如此。</p>
<p>執政時代　民政黨應時代之需要而組織。氏不避艱辛。竭力羅致黨員。不數年而羽翼遍三島。去歲在田中義一虐政之餘。選舉勝利氏被任爲首相。乃愈益奮發。籌行減俸及三大整理案。深思竭慮。每至精神疲憊之時。頻擊其首。家人勸毌自苦。氏恒長歡不止。聞每日食不過二餐。睡眠僅五小時耳。</p>

<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>紹興有李皮匠者。年三十許。自謂吳縣人。然所操不盡吳語。方音到雜。意其所涉當甚廣遠。李設攤于戶首。爲人上鞋而外。兼製粗鞋求售。每日薄暮。輒見其手一書。目不他瞬。爲狀甚勤。談興發。與人道上下古今。至悉至趣。恒使聽者不忍舍去。一日。一裝束似學生之某甲。來購鞋見鞋架置社會學要旨一書率然曰。汝亦知書耶。李遜曰。蓋偶然消遣也。此本曾讀一過。有未盡了解處。特再加一回揣摩耳。言下津津述書中意詣。不能自已。甲瞠目直視。忸怩而退。鞋亦未購云。</p>

<p>上海籌募各省水災急賑會常務委員許世英與王一亭二君。因今歲水災有。除政府撥欵救濟外。全賴各界人士踴躍捐輸。特合作流民圖。將被災情况。繪於素紙。題以詩詞。以便付印分贈各界。使人觸目驚心。爰摘錄其意義。以享閱者。而廣宣傳。</p>
<p>屏條　上繪汪洋一片。被溺者或僅露頭頂。尙在呼援者。或業已氣絕。浮於水面者。高處植立一人。俯視水中慘狀。雙眉緊鎖。束手無策。題有七絕一首。曰一幅流民鄭俠圖。庚癸到處爲民呼。試觀困苦頻連狀。已溺己餓由也夫。并註救命救命四大字。附跋曰。今年各省水災奇重。流離失所。不知凡幾。懇求有力者發心捐助。廣種福田。二十年八月白龍山人寫。</p>
<p>立軸　約長四尺。上繪溺於澤國者數十人。均已氣絕。遠望水中。露出大樹之頂。上棲七八人。均鳩形鵠面。并抱有小孩。孩作啼哭狀。題有七絕兩首。曰雨雨風風驀地來。霎時水漲没樓臺。無衣無食兼無住。鬻女與男啼哭哀。大陸胥沉民命懸。何人有力能回天。而今種福收成易。試買千金續命田。下書辛未新秋。各省水災。爲寫流民圖白龍山人數數字。</p>
<p>摺扇　又有一摺扇。預備送與赴漢放賑之朱棄塵君。一面錄許世英所撰之水災詠事七絕一首。曰牀下魚兒帳上蛙。階前艇子室中車。更憐草舍沈淪盡。只見流亡不見家。一面繪船一艘。内有二人。正在營救水中被難災民。題曰。行路難於蜀道難。浮沉市井此狂瀾。文殊大願船如在。普渡衆生高處安。并有跋曰。辛未新秋。各省水災。漢口尤重。棄塵先生發大願心。濟生會籌賑。先生往救。不辭勞苦。令人欽佩。作此以贈。王震。</p>

<p>我友銖。公筆端挾飛動之致。每摹繪景物。使人讀之。如身歷其境。延景賞心。應接不暇。唯恐其終篇也。其文隨物賦形。遇園成璧。若太虚之雲。起止無心。自然成趣。意其下筆直書。了不經意。心暇手閒。乃能如是。讀其文者。輒與之俱化。杜老之詩曰。意愜關飛動。篇終接混茫。此非善爲文者不能道。亦非善讀文者不能道。銖公之文頗稱之矣。其文兼有詩詞。有小說。有游記。於古近酈道元。近柳子厚又近唐人小說。一日偶稱故都風物之美。勸余往游。因欲仿陸士龍之說　中。鮑明遠之記雷岸。快余等過屠大嚼之意。連夕握管。　成數十篇。猶不能自己。余受而讀之。擊節稱快。謂自來導游之作。無此精麗也。冠茲數語。以讅同好。二十年夏日春痕記。</p>

<p>燕京雜記云。（京中婦人不知織紉。日事調脂裹足多買肉麵生果等物。隨意饕餮。家徒四壁。一出門。珠翠滿頭時裝衣服。長短合宜。居然大家風範）。舊京遺事云。（内無擔石之儲。出有綺綾之服）。此蓋由明清兩朝貴游仕宦胥吏軍籍麕居此地。養成媮靡之風。晚清旗籍婦女。尤爲人所詬病。一旦國亡家破旣無謀生之技能。復鮮服勞之訓練。於是年長者屈爲傭工。妙齡淪而賣笑。其境極可憐。其故抑非一朝一夕矣。旗女於婦功毫不講求。固如上述。即冶容之飾。亦遜於漢人。往時咸梳高髻。闊幾盈尺。成以假髮。全失天然之美益以濃敷脂粉。俗艶逼人自民國十三年移宫以後。已不復見此裝飾。轉效漢妝。益有邯鄲學步之誚。古云燕趙多佳人。此語不適於今矣。然滿洲婦女有一事爲漢人所不逮。蓋貴游之家。習於禮範。應對進退。動容周旋中矩儀態萬方。不矜不迫。殆非勉學而能。歐人重社交婦人以羞澀生硬爲恥。此風於滿洲見之。本斯美質。去其驕惰。加以近代飾容之術固足爲模範女子也。滿人之絕美者。固亦數數見之。特稍拙於塗飾耳。其裝束亦勝於漢人。故旗袍至今不廢而轉稱便也。</p>
<h3 id="c104">城圯誌異 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>當日前霪雨連綿時。我常城垣倒坍甚多。此中有兩事甚異。記之以告讀者。</p>
<p>大北門城樓下坍時。正上午十一時許。城下之往返者絡繹不絕。城坍絕廣磚石盡兩日之力始移去。而未傷一人。至可異也。緣城樓下墮時。先有一巨磚落地行人之見之者。動色相告曰。城將坍矣。速避勿行。於是絡繹出入者悉奔立遠視。以俟其變。果也未及五分鐘轟然一聲。全部下傾矣。設先無一碍下墮。則行人决不料城之將坍。依然出入。而一幕慘劇。將不堪設想。故此一磚之下。不啻救火車之警鐘。令人趨避也。</p>
<p>又一家所居。逼近城垣。乃鄕人之懼綁匪而來城稅居者也。霪雨中其室後之城垣在日間已現尺許裂痕。傾圯在即。人勸速徙。鄕人泰然處之。入夜乃高枕而臥。詎料午夜大禍臨頭。城垣由上崩下。悉蓋其居。覆巢之下。寗有完卵。一家五人死者居四。所幸生者。一纔三四齡之稚子耳。鄕人以懼匪而來城。今竟以避匪而喪身。寗不可嘆。所可異者。此僅生之稚子也。稚子在鄕。曾爲匪綁。匪以要挾不遂。舉槍畢其命。詎一彈飛出。不中稚子而斃一匪。再擊之。仍不中匪異之。赦而不殺。後稚子終以黄金易之歸歸則舉家來城。避入桃源。此次城傾時。稚子臥母懷。母由床跌地。稚子隨之下本枕母臂者。至是則適在母臂下。母壓木石立斃。兒則賴母臂之張弓然。未受壓迫。故天明發掘時。稚子猶安然。無恙也。咸謂此子不死於匪手。不死於墮城之下。諺云。大難不死。必有後福。稚子來日必將大有爲也。然亦奇矣。</p>

<h3 id="c105">丈夫的妻子（一） <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>你這傻子！人家的事，干你什麽，要你這樣上勁？）陳夫人因爲在白天感受到陳先生不愉快而冷落的神色以爲丈夫不應當赤裸裸地把李先生的秘密完全去告訴李夫人，所以十分埋怨伊的丈夫，在臨睡而還未着枕的時候。伊覺得丈夫的態度是太傻，容易發生兩件不幸的事情，直接的，陳先生和李先生幾年很好的友誼，立刻會發生裂痕，不容易恢復舊狀；間接的，可以使李家夫婦加增一重隔膜，或者竟因責善過嚴而失和；除此以外，也許不會了解陳先生的心理是光明忠實者，而會誤會到這樣援助李夫人，是懷有其他居心叵測的一種策略。伊爲了這種種的過慮，所以很不滿意於丈夫，雖然伊和李夫人也是極密切的朋友很願意援助李夫人離開怨憤悲苦的環境之中。</p>
<p>（……）陳先生默然不作一詞，他以爲自己的行爲是很正直，很正直，很慈善，很合理的；但是，他也自認未免有些傻氣。他想：要救出李先生沈戀在迷惘的道中，而使他們夫婦，得以永久優游於快樂戀愛的光陰裏，只有自己來做一次傻子，或者有些効騐。</p>
<p>這樣可怕的迷惘道路，陳先生自己也經壓過，曾因此而演出了不少的悲哀故事，他是有經騐的人了。夫婦間失和了的光陰，比患了眼炎而受到强烈光線的刺激，還要苦育；比飢餓的身子，行在黑暗的路中，又逢到了大風雨，還要難受；他更體念到一個婦人在丈夫沈戀在迷惘的路中，苦苦拉勸丈夫回頭，終於無効的時候，急切中又不得援助，是何等的怨憤悲苦！正如丈夫落在泥窖裏，他的妻子要救也無法可施的時候是一等的惶急與迫切。在這時候，要是有人肯借一根繩子或竹子給伊，使伊可以設法援助伊的丈夫這是人類應有的同情，旣没有别種作用，也不是希冀何種報酬，那麽還不能算眞是一個傻子。</p>

<p>棉市趨緊、漲風劇烈以外棉穩定、有雨水過多報告之說、本埠棉市因四方水災嚴重、新棉大受影響、且抛空者殊巨、稍有反動漲勢尤銳、十月份花形勢愈挺、因陳貨缺乏新花受水患、上市較晚、買方購進加碼、但海外狀况未有十分變化、前途究屬若何、仍依美棉爲進退、</p>

<p>聽旁人說到天氣𤍠了、我把頭抬起來望望天花板、心裏想起許多無用的事、像要流眼涙、我是覺得能有工夫說𤍠的人、也終於是幸福的、</p>
<p>記起有一個時候、我不能安心同我的幽靜生活妥協、說要動、說青年在極度消沉過後是勇敢的要求剌激、於是像夢一般的我從北平跑到南京當了兵、</p>
<p>大家都是年輕、有火一樣的𤍠情、眼前的憧　是革命、隊伍中從早到晚使你不敢放鬆了謹愼、各人的工作都是緊張的、聽到樹間的蟬鳴、却也不理會是夏天已然來了、手裏拿着的是、桿七九步槍、在操塲上、没有人注意過太陽、</p>
<p>於今環境把我帶到另一世界裏、雖因病而更感到了窮的痛切、可是坐在這裏很太平的寫文章是有權利的、我從早到晚終是寫、寫些什麽拿到那裏發表、連我自己也没有勇氣回答、彷彿明白自從社會不需要我之後、我不能對於盡這無聊的義務有輕視、</p>
<p>說我是研究文學的人嗎、我傷心、爲了剏作、我說、把各種樣的生活都嘗一嘗吧、於是我像一隻驚了的羊、無頭緒的在四處跑、那裏是人生的疆塲、戰况傳來時、或勝或敗、我不喜不悲、這樹、有六年過去了、看看消瘦孱弱的我的體格、摸一摸那各部分的傷痕我逃了、一個潰兵、</p>
<p>可是我還該慶賀我僥倖没有死吧、我死了、則讓旁人笑我行爲過蠢的機會也要喪失的、那些人他們說、</p>
<p>（人生是什麽呢看一看吧、我們是大家的標準）、</p>
<p>是怎樣的一個標準呢、我知道的是他們告訴我、</p>
<p>朋友、這年頭兒太可憐了、人們都是那樣的窮苦、我們有智識的青年能不替他們解除嗎、一方面對於壓迫者們、我們要示威的、我們的責任就是該讓那些人們摧殘的力量遇到毁壞的、</p>
<p>我對這話是不敢說是非的、可是他們說我是落伍、到後、幾天過去了、他們又把我捉着、說、</p>
<p>（無怪乎××說是没辦法、眞是的、社會上没有一個人了解我們的行動、難道我們的時間精力只是得到這一點譏笑的報酬嗎、）</p>
<p>這話說過不久、是我在公園裏又遇到他們、時間是秋天風吹來有凄凉意、搖頭頓足的影子、我清楚他們内心在徬徨、</p>
<p>（、老汪、許久不見了、你也常到公園來玩嗎）</p>
<p>（我不常來、因爲我感覺時間太窮了、）</p>
<p>（啊、你眞勇敢、能說時間太窮的人、工作一定很多的、我們每天却總要到這裏消遣的、）</p>
<p>對他們我只有笑、没有什麽適當的話可算是我吻合於當前塲的回答、</p>
<p>（可是當眞没有我們的出路嗎、世界是這樣大、）</p>
<p>（這樣活下去、眞是危險、）</p>
<p>（……）</p>
<p>他們還說了若干的話、我知道没有同情他們的話、是容易讓他們笑我是没有受過挫折的、人</p>
<p>秋天死了、春天都已竟來到人間、可是這些人我不再見到了、我明一些人在失意的時候會自殺的、像對他有些躭心、到處搜尋他們的消息、是我接到他們這樣的回信、</p>
<p>（朋友、眞是對不起、我跑到這很遠的異地來、覺得倉促中给朋友寫信是失敬的、况且軍隊的生活、把我的影子像微如游離的螢火、在喊殺敵都覺無暇的時候、原諒我吧、不能寫長信了、）</p>
<p>另一個人的信</p>
<p>（…聽說××在軍××軍做軍需、因爲吃私過多、免職了、你知道嗎、據聞免職也還算徼倖呢、……）</p>
<p>他們之中有的做了敎員、聽旁人說、這朋友現在的議論是、</p>
<p>（只有從敎育入手、才是青年的好出路、中國目下缺乏的領導人材、當敎員是領導工作的第一步、）</p>
<p>聽了這話以後、彷佛一年前這朋友在學校鼓動更換敎員的風潮、以及那時所謂敎育是盲人瞎馬、這些、我都忘了、</p>
<p>兩月前、告我誓守獨身的××那天領着愛人到Open　air去游泳我說</p>
<p>（××女人可是毒蛇呀、你說過的、）</p>
<p>××當時没有回話、可是過幾天有人對我講、××對我不滿說我在游泳池對他說的話是有意的侮辱、而且駡我腐化還有蔑視女權、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>想起來我到處被人嘲笑很久了、如今日一樣、可是我能顧慮這些嗎、青年們都是如此的前進着發展着、我却仍然坐在這裏、做一種近於傻的寫文章的事、我有什麽用處呢、</p>
<p>我没有告訴人、我娘在幾千里外很久的捱了餓、在四馬路的人叢中我找到每個野鷄有像我那失依的妹妹的可能、自己是走到青春的尾梢、說是同幸福别離很久嗎、……</p>
<p>我覺得想到自身的事、都是奢侈、</p>
<p>熱嗎、得了時代的意志我還是老老實實的做我的分内事、我要寫、我在寫前寫後都有我的行動、</p>

<h3 id="e6">The Question of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang Going Abroad <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang and Han Fuqu Made Final Contact Yesterday</p>
<p>Three Steps Proposed for Implementation</p>
<p>(Beiping) The generals in North China have repeatedly discussed and planned the issue of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang going abroad. The first step is to ask Yan Xishan to leave Shanxi voluntarily, first by urging him by Shanxi generals nearby. If it is inconvenient to go abroad, he can reside anywhere in the country, as long as he leaves Shanxi. There is absolutely no concern about his personal safety. If Yan Xishan still does not leave Shanxi, the generals in North China will come forward to urge him, following the central government's intention to ensure that Yan Xishan leaves Shanxi immediately to maintain security in North China. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang visited Han Fuqu this afternoon, talked for about half an hour, and invited Han to go to the hospital tonight for final consultations. As a result of consultations with all parties on the Yan Xishan issue, three steps are proposed: (1) Telegraph the generals in Shanxi to unanimously persuade Yan Xishan to realize the situation and leave Shanxi. (2) If Yan Xishan does not listen to the persuasion, a telegram will be sent in the name of all the generals in the North. (3) If the persuasion is not heeded, the necessary measures will be taken to urge him finally. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuqu visited Zhang Xueliang tonight and made some statements. He will return to Jinan with Zhuang Bocheng in a few days. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Zhang Xueliang met with Xu Yongchang last night, he has telegraphed the Shanxi generals to urge Yan Xishan to leave quickly. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan said that after Feng Yuxiang left the army, he resided in the small mountains of Yuda River, west of Fenyang, spending his days reading books and practicing calligraphy for leisure, and did not participate in politics. He did not receive former subordinates who came to visit him. Moreover, since the central government has not issued an arrest warrant, Feng Yuxiang's going abroad cannot be compared with Yan Xishan's. However, Yan Xishan must leave Shanxi to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. Vice Chairman Yan Xishan also indicated that Yan Xishan can choose to reside in Beiping or Tianjin, and he is willing to guarantee his safety, but Yan Xishan must leave Shanxi before there is a solution, etc. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhuang Bocheng said that Zhang Xueliang expressed the hope that Yan Xishan would leave Shanxi as soon as possible. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Hangxian District Court submitted a request for interpretation of the clauses on copyright infringement lawsuits. The Judicial Yuan has interpreted it as follows: Copyrighted works are those that have been registered in accordance with the Copyright Law, so copyright infringement lawsuits can only be filed after registration. This is clearly stipulated in Article 23 of the Copyright Law. The situation described in the telegram, where the copyrighted work is in the process of applying for registration or has been reprinted or copied before registration, means that the infringed party is seeking ordinary benefits, not copyright. Therefore, a lawsuit seeking compensation does not apply to the provisions of that article. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e20">The Forensic Medical Opinion on the Zhu Shude Case <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Jinan Medical Association released a forensic medical opinion on the tragic death of Zhu Shude, which mainly stated: (1) If the deceased was healthy before death, wore clothes, and it was during the summer, the corpse would take at least ten to twelve hours to cool down. However, Zhu died at 5:00 PM on July 27th, and the examination at 6:00 PM showed that the corpse was already cold, which is inconsistent with forensic medical principles. It is inferred that the time of death was at the latest in the forenoon of the same day or the night before. (2) If Zhu committed suicide in bed, her right arm and hand would be bent and clenched, showing a shooting posture. Even if the gun was not in her hand, it would fall beside her, and there would be burns on her palm and fingers. At this time, she would have no strength to throw the gun a few feet away. However, during the examination after death, not only was the right hand not bent or clenched, but the gun was under the bed, five feet away from the deceased. The shell was found elsewhere afterward, and the bullet was never found. (3) Suicides often use their right hand to hold a gun and shoot at their head, either from front to back or from right to left. Unless the person is left-handed, it is rare to go in the opposite direction. The muzzle is usually within one foot of the head, and the shape of the entrance wound often shows scorching and blackening due to the action of gunpowder, and the epidermis is bruised and burned. In the case of homicide, if the distance is more than one meter, not only will there be no signs of gunpowder blackening, but the exit wound will also be larger than the entrance wound. If the entrance and exit cannot be examined due to corpse decay, an autopsy must be performed to observe the diameter of the entrance wound in the bone, which should be consistent with the size of the bullet. The edge is mostly smooth and sharp. The exit wound is often larger than the bullet, the edge is irregular, and there are bone fragments exposed. Now, the examination of the left and right wounds did not prove any signs of blackening. If the skull is dissected again to prove the entrance and direction, a more definite proof can be obtained.

<h3 id="e39">Declaration for the 60th Anniversary Year of This Newspaper <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper was founded in 1872, which was the 11th year of the Tongzhi reign in the Qing Dynasty, a Ren Shen year. The year 1932 will again be a Ren Shen year. Time passes quickly. Sixty years have passed in a flash. Looking forward and back, it is impossible not to commemorate this. Therefore, starting from today, this year is designated as the anniversary year.</p>
<p>What is meant by "impossible not to commemorate"?</p>
<p>Let us try to look back at what the world was like sixty years ago. At that time, in the West, the Suez Canal had just been opened, and the great powers were competing to seek colonies overseas. In the East, Japan had just embarked on the path of the Meiji Restoration and had no significant weight in the world. What is it like now? Based on these sixty years of change, and in accordance with the speed of this evolution, what will the world be like in the future?</p>
<p>Let us also try to look back at what China was like sixty years ago. At that time, the great powers had already knocked open the door of our quiet nation, demanding mutual trade and commerce, and competing to use unequal treaties to bind our nation. People with foresight were just beginning to talk about foreign affairs. Although the national fortune of the Qing Dynasty was declining, the people were still firmly confined under autocratic politics. What is it like now? Based on these sixty years of change, and in accordance with the speed of this evolution, what will China be like in the future?</p>
<p>Looking back on the past, it is all history. A new page in history is being continuously unfolded. This newspaper is one of the earliest established newspapers in the country. In the torrent of historical evolution of the past sixty years, has it ever contributed a little to pushing forward? Whether it was meritorious or guilty, this is not something that the colleagues of this newspaper are willing to consider today. What is important is how this newspaper should shoulder the heavy responsibility of being a pioneer in society and promoting the times in the new historical pages that will continue to unfold, how to make society enter a reasonable and normal track, and how to make our nation reach prosperity and flourishing. This is what the colleagues of this newspaper solemnly and deeply realize today, after sixty years, and dare not relax in the slightest.</p>
<p>If we think about it, what should we do? Take positive action, strive to improve this newspaper, and strive to fulfill the responsibilities we should bear. Do not hesitate, do not shirk, do not shrink back. Do our best, hoping to contribute to ourselves. This is the greatest determination of the colleagues of this newspaper after deep reflection.</p>
<p>Please say in one sentence what this newspaper wants to contribute in the future.</p>
<p>1.  Science is the key to humanity's search for happiness. The degree of scientific development and the amount of happiness enjoyed by humanity are actually two parallel lines developing in the same direction. The countries of Europe and America, as well as neighboring Japan, have developed science, and their people are able to enjoy the happiness of material civilization. Only our country, with its vast land and abundant resources, and its large population, is still stagnating in the cultural remnants of the 19th century. People have already moved forward like lightning, while we can only chase after them and are unable to catch up. Treasures fill the fields, but we do not know how to take them. Wealth is abandoned on the ground, but we do not know how to use it. The great powers with developed science use their material civilization to approach us. The disasters of nature are even more unleashing their violence to oppress us. The country is therefore impoverished, and the people's livelihood is therefore declining. Disasters and chaos follow one another, and the foundation lies in this. In the future, this newspaper will do its best to publicize and introduce new scientific knowledge to the people, encourage research interest, so as to promote its progress, and even more advocate construction, so as to make China enter the realm of the modern scientific world and build a brand-new society and country. 2. Culture is the architecture of the upper class of society, and its foundation is the economy. All human activities are centered on the economy. Since the Industrial Revolution in modern times, the world economy has been integrated into one. Any economic ripple in any country will have an impact on the world, just like a huge wave. Political changes are based on this. The outbreak of war is based on this. The carving up of colonies is also based on this. We live in the great web of the world economy every day. We are in a changing political situation centered on the economy every day. In particular, we are in an economically backward, semi-colonial land that is ravaged and carved up by the great powers. We must have a clear understanding of the current situation of the world economy and its turning point, and predict its future. In the future, this newspaper will strive to state the economic situation of the world, dissect the characteristics of our country's economy, and provide it to the public for exploration, so as to find the road that our country should take.</p>
<p>2.  The phenomena currently presented before our eyes are all extremely serious social problems. The failure to popularize education and the pathological nature of agriculture, industry, and commerce. The increase in the number of unemployed people. The rise of bandits. All these latent problems, if not solved one day, the country and society will not be able to stabilize their order one day. In the future, this newspaper will explore the crux of the problems from the contradictory phenomena, and seek the way to properly solve them, so that society can step onto the right track and people's livelihood can tend to be stable. 4. After the revolution, everything needs to be managed. All kinds of political facilities urgently need the cooperation of the government and the people. Eliminating accumulated malpractices and initiating new policies. Uprooting the foundation of the old society and planting the seeds of the new society. It is even more necessary for the government and the people to work together. In this difficult process, the government should always humbly adopt public opinion, and the people should know how to understand politics and recognize their own responsibilities. In the future, this newspaper will use an extremely sincere attitude to offer advice to the government and fulfill its responsibility to contribute to the people.</p>
<p>3.  Youth is the backbone of the future society. They are sensitive, enthusiastic, and have a pure will. Living in a modern society where social order is unstable, young people are suffering a lot. They cannot study, they cannot work, they are displaced, and they are criticized by the world. Looking around, they are at a loss and have nothing to rely on. In recent years, the young people who have been suffering, moaning, and pessimistic about the world are none other than the vitality of our country today and the pillars of tomorrow. This phenomenon is truly an irreparable loss to our country. In the future, this newspaper is willing to have sincere discussions with young people and be a good friend who explores the way for young people, so that we can work together to advance on the broad path of health, purity, courage, progress, and struggle.</p>
<p>4.  In recent years, the call to "go to the frontier" has often filled our ears. In fact, south of the Yangtze River and north of the Yellow River, the people are suffering from crowding, and it is no different from the past. In the Northeast and Northwest, there are thousands of miles of wasteland, and no one is farming it, and it is still the same as before. Sitting and watching the great mountains and rivers, triggering the covetousness of strong neighbors. The people's food in the country is hard to come by. In the future, this newspaper will explore the implementation plans and programs for immigration and colonization of the border, and vigorously advocate it to promote its implementation.</p>
<p>5.  Unequal treaties are the shackles that bind the life of our nation, and they are a powerful tool for the great powers to control our country. For nearly a hundred years, our country has been reduced to a semi-colonial status and has been unable to rise up. This is because of the constraints of unequal treaties. The cession of mountains and rivers, the loss of sovereignty, and the trampling of the lives of our people by the strong and violent, such as the Jinan Massacre, the recent Wanbaoshan incident, and the massacre of our overseas Chinese by Japan and Korea, are all the result of unequal treaties. If unequal treaties are not abolished one day, our country and our nation will not be able to rise up one day, and our people will not be able to escape from the abyss of suffering one day.

<p>Improving the Economic Situation is the Central Issue</p>
<p>The Fate of the German-Austrian Tax Treaty is Attracting Attention from All Parties</p>
<p>Briand Postpones His Trip to Geneva</p>
<p>Minorities Hold Routine Meeting</p>
<p>Geneva, 30th, National News Agency Telegram The representatives attending the European Commission meeting have mostly arrived tonight, and the departments are bustling with activity, as usual. The German delegation also arrived this afternoon with the Austrian delegation. The chief Austrian representative is Dr. Schober. After getting off the train, he immediately visited German Foreign Minister Curtius for talks. All delegations are paying attention to the future ruling of the International Court of Justice on the German-Austrian customs agreement. This move is closely related to the progress of the European Commission meeting. The meeting is scheduled to open tomorrow. The report on the current economic situation in Europe and its improvement proposals are all on the agenda. The report was drafted by the expert committee after two weeks of deliberation. The report believes that hoarding cash is the crux of Europe's misfortune, so it advocates the establishment of a new international bank, whose shares are subscribed by public and private banks. The loans handled by the bank should be jointly guaranteed by all European countries. The report also firmly advocates overthrowing the current high tariff barriers, saying that this kind of parochialism is extremely harmful. In the future, Europe must gradually transform into a single market, and the overall situation can only turn from bad to good if a pan-European customs union is established.</p>
<p>Geneva, 30th, Reuters Telegram American and German financial experts were commissioned by the Economic Expert Committee to investigate ways to stop the world economic panic. A report has now been drafted, and the recommendations include (removing trade barriers, European countries cooperate, and making Europe a world market). The League of Nations issued a communiqué due to the financial experts' proposal to establish an international bank to support world trade. The communiqué only contained Belgium's proposed plan for the international bank. It is heard that the British representative, Layton, has expressed his personal opinion that the plan cannot be applied at present.</p>
<p>Geneva, 30th, National News Agency Telegram As the League of Nations General Assembly opened, people in the League of Nations today voiced that this meeting can truly express the position of the world today on the issue of disarmament. Since the League of Nations decided to convene a disarmament conference in February next year a year ago, the world situation has changed greatly in terms of disarmament. There are four major elements that have changed the world atmosphere: (1) There has been a significant tension in the European political situation. The spirit of cooperation of the late German Foreign Minister Stresemann is no longer visible, and it is very different from the situation in the past when the Locarno spirit was the main element for solving European problems. (2) After the world economic decline, the European economy has become more depressed. Germany and England have experienced difficulties one after another, which makes people feel uneasy, and it is not easy to contribute to the peaceful atmosphere necessary for creating a disarmament conference. (3) Communism has made great progress in Europe. The recent unrest in Spain and the open threat of German communism are all clear evidence of this. (4) All countries recognize that if a country in Europe experiences financial difficulties or a communist party uprising, the impact will inevitably be difficult to limit to one place. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain considerable military equipment to protect the current government. Because of all these, the current League of Nations General Assembly will discuss two points: (1) Whether the disarmament conference should be convened on the originally scheduled date, and (2) Pass the draft disarmament convention proposed by the Disarmament Preparatory Committee.</p>
<p>Paris, 30th, National News Agency Telegram Foreign Minister Briand decided to postpone his trip to Geneva on the advice of his doctor. Briand has indeed fully recovered, but the doctor insisted that Briand still needs to rest for a week. The Prime Minister, Laval, talked with Briand for a long time this afternoon and decided that the Foreign Minister would go to Geneva next Sunday. The chief French representative will be temporarily replaced by Finance Minister Flandin and the newly appointed ambassador to Germany, Poncet. The delegation left here tonight for Geneva.</p>
<p>Geneva, 30th, National News Agency Telegram The annual autumn minority conference opened here today. Representatives of 35 minorities under the jurisdiction of 17 European countries attended the meeting. There were a total of 135 representatives, including several representatives of the Catalan and Basque tribes who were allowed to attend by the Spanish government. The association was founded in 1924, and has been meeting at this time every year without interruption.</p>

<p>The British Financial Position is Not Inferior to That of the United States</p>
<p>Statistical Figures from an Economist</p>
<p>London, 31st, Reuters Telegram Prime Minister MacDonald is currently recuperating in Lossiemouth, Scotland, and has accumulated a large number of letters encouraging him to overcome national difficulties. The senders range from bishops to unemployed people, from all walks of life. MacDonald said that his mailbag was a great excitement. Nine out of ten letters expressed willingness to help overcome national difficulties, which shows that all levels of society have a spirit of sacrifice. MacDonald will now fly back to London to attend today's afternoon cabinet meeting. At the end of last week, MacDonald was still reviewing the report of the Cabinet Committee studying the government's economic proposals.</p>
<p>London, 31st, Reuters Telegram The government's economic plan is very speculative to outsiders, and there are many rumors. It is now said that the tea tax may be reimposed.</p>
<p>London, 31st, Reuters Telegram Today's Labour Party newspaper, the Daily Express, claimed that large insurance companies have privately collected securities for overseas investment, totaling 100 million pounds, which are intended to be used to protect British gold. The insurance company, led by the Prudential Insurance Company, collected this amount in the past ten days and has contributed to the government as collateral for borrowing to strengthen British gold. However, the government does not need this, because the debts recently agreed upon by the United States and France can be used at any time without collateral. An economist who signed his name also published figures showing that the British financial position is not slightly inferior to that of the United States. The total value of long-term debts placed by the United Kingdom abroad is 400 million pounds, while the total value of long-term debts abroad by the United States is US$150 million. At the end of 1930, the United Kingdom's net short-term debts to foreigners had been reduced from £30.2 million to £25.4 million, according to Macmillan's report, while the United States' net short-term debts to foreigners were £106.8 million.</p>

<p>Washington, 30th, National News Agency Telegram US Treasury Secretary Mellon announced today a method to make up for the treasury deficit of 100 million yuan. He plans to issue 800 million yuan of 3% long-term public bonds, which will be repaid in 24 years, and 300 million yuan of 1.5% treasury bills, which will be repaid in one year, hoping to avoid tax increases. However, the Department of Finance is currently discussing revising tax laws in order to submit them to the 72nd New Congress. It is expected to create a federal gasoline tax and restore the car tax that was abolished two years ago.</p>

<p>Official Telegram</p>
<p>Yangzhou Telegram to all newspapers: Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu, accompanied by Aide-de-Camp Song Bangrong, Chief Secretary Sun Zhicheng, Councilor Wang Chunru, Chen Zemin, Sun Yun, and others, departed on the 31st morning with food and cash to personally inspect the disaster situation in Xiannvmiao, Shaobo, Gaoyou, Bao'ying, and other places, and to distribute emergency relief. Secret Declaration No. 30 from the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>Yangzhou Telegram to all newspapers: Earlier, Commissioner Zhang Zhijiang telegraphed on the [day name omitted] day to all national relief associations and charities, pleading for the Jiangsu disaster victims. The telegram stated: The [day name omitted] day telegram described the Jiangsu flood situation, which we trust you have noted. According to Zhang Ruitang, a councilor dispatched by this office to Shaobo and Gaoyou to protect and rescue disaster victims, the area is flooded, a vast expanse of water, and the disaster victims are crying out for food, a truly unbearable sight. All villages are submerged, with only treetops visible, and refugees are clinging to them, urgently awaiting rescue. However, due to the rapid currents at the breach points, boats are unable to reach them, causing great anxiety. The devastation of this flood is truly unspeakable and unbearable to hear. Upon hearing this, my heart is consumed with worry. For the current relief efforts, firstly, we must prepare more boats; secondly, we must prepare more grain; and thirdly, we must find ways to accommodate the refugees. The number of those who have already died is countless, and the number of those who are dying or about to die is still in the hundreds of thousands. The disaster situation in Xinghua and other counties below is even more severe. Only the gate tower of Xinghua County is visible, with everything else submerged. In addition to this office, together with the provincial government and local officials and gentry, doing our utmost to find ways to rescue the disaster victims in the four surrounding areas, we also implore your association to show great compassion and provide assistance for the rescue, to which we eagerly await your orders. Zhang Zhijiang respectfully bows. Please publish this in your newspaper to spread the word. Secret Declaration No. 30 from the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>Ma Shexiang's Telegram Clarifying the Gansu Incident - Most Urgent To the Central Party Headquarters, Party Headquarters of all provinces and cities, all Yuan and Ministry Councils, Chairmen of all provincial governments, Deputy Commander Zhang of Beiping, Commanders-in-Chief of all routes, Commanders, Division and Brigade Commanders, all legal entities, and all newspapers: I recently submitted a telegram to Chairman Chiang of the National Government, stating: Regarding the Gansu Incident, I previously presented it to the government and the Yuan based on telegrams from various parties. I recently saw a telegram from all sectors of Gansu party, government, military, agriculture, commerce, and academia, stating: Provincial Chairman Ma Hongbin was detained, Lei Zhongtian was publicly elected as Commander-in-Chief of the Gansu Security Forces, and Ma Wenche was concurrently appointed as Chairman, and has already taken office. I also submitted a telegram to Your Excellency on the [day name omitted] day, which I trust you have clearly noted. The telegram listed Hongbin's usurpation of political power and protection of bandits, and falsely accused Fu Xiang and Hongbin of the military disasters in Liangzhou and Zhenfan. Those who know the political situation in Gansu can immediately refute its falsity, and it is not worth refuting. However, I still cannot refrain from saying a word to Your Excellency: Hongbin was appointed as acting chairman of Gansu Province in December of last year, at a time when Gansu was in the aftermath of a great war, bandits were rampant, refugees were everywhere, the province had no government, and the people were in dire straits. Hongbin, as a native of the province, accepted the mandate at a time of chaos and struggled to cope, feeling overwhelmed. Therefore, he repeatedly pleaded for the appointment of a more capable person to avoid mediocrity. After two months, compelled by repeated telegrams from the central government and the continuous calls from all sectors of the province, he had no choice but to travel lightly from Ningxia to Lanzhou. At the same time, he also declared to Your Excellency that he would temporarily act for a maximum of two months. After arriving in the province, he mediated disputes, settled refugees, and showed great care for the troops stationed in Lanzhou, and repeatedly telegraphed to protect Cai and other members dispatched by the central government, including Ma Wenche, demonstrating harmony and mutual assistance. All these facts are documented and cannot be distorted by Fu Xiang alone. As for the reorganization of the Gansu provincial government, it was because all members of the Gansu province, except for the chairman, had not been appointed for half a year, and they shirked their responsibilities when things happened, making it impossible to deal with them. The central government, mindful of the importance of border administration, appointed members from the old members and inspectors to specialize in responsibility. Although Hongbin still served as chairman, he repeatedly telegraphed his resignation after receiving the order, stating that he was temporarily serving in a transitional capacity, which shows that he has always been indifferent to fame and fortune, and this should be known to Your Excellency. The telegram falsely accused him of seizing political power, which is contrary to the facts. As for Fu Xiang personally, he has been away from the province for more than ten years, and although he has respect for his homeland, he is deeply wary of his nephews. When Commander Gu Zhutong was ordered to enter Gansu, Fu Xiang repeatedly telegraphed to urge him and repeatedly begged Your Excellency to urge him to proceed quickly, as he feared that the conspiracy would last for a long time and hidden dangers would arise. It would be fortunate for Hongbin to be relieved of his responsibilities as soon as possible. The telegram also arbitrarily fabricated and falsely accused Xiang personally, which is laughable. As for the fact that Gansu has suffered from military disasters for many years, which are blamed on Xiang and others, this is even further from the truth. Zhenfan and Liangzhou have suffered from military banditry, which occurred in the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China, while Hongbin had already led troops from Ningxia to the east in the 16th year, and Fu Xiang had also been away from Gansu for a long time. He only heard about the disasters in his hometown. Moreover, Fu Xiang's entire family suffered the most from the banditry in those years, and the houses in Dahe and Ningxia were burned down. The facts are all there, so who should be blamed? As for Ma Tingxian and others, they are not of the same clan as Xiang, and their intentions are incompatible. Last winter, when Hongbin was ordered to govern Gansu, Ma Tingxian immediately opposed him, and the documents are all there and can be reviewed. How can they be confused? Hongbin has been deferential in everything since becoming acting chairman. The guards of the provincial government and various cities are all stationed by Lei Zhongtian's troops. He has never brought a single soldier when entering and leaving the office. Since he has been entrusted with his life and family, how can he be said to have entered the city in plain clothes? All these inverted and obscured words are not worth the sneer of a knowledgeable person. As for whether the various sections mentioned in the telegram are factual, if public morality has not been completely extinguished, it is not difficult to distinguish right from wrong. At present, a small number of troops near Lanzhou have all been withdrawn, and the troops stationed in Ningxia, Suiliang, and Qinghai are also guarding their original defenses, and are all subject to the fair handling of the central government. However, I am mindful that Gansu has suffered from military drought for a long time, and all sectors of the province are supporting the central government and praying for peace. Now, there is such an unreasonable telegram. If it is not coercion, it must be a fabricated name. The manipulation is only by one or two people. Your Excellency's virtue and power are far-reaching. I implore you to distinguish right from wrong, rectify discipline, pacify the west, and secure the borders. The country is fortunate, Gansu is fortunate. I await your instructions in fear and trembling. Fu Xiang is old and has been away from his hometown for more than ten years. He has always had the intention of retiring, but he has been falsely accused for no reason. He is ashamed of his lack of virtue and unable to help the difficulties of the time. However, there are constant penalties in the country for abandoning discipline and inverting right and wrong. I fear that rumors from afar will confuse the facts, so I have sent this communication. I hope you will understand. Ma Fuxiang bows on the [day name omitted] day.</p>
<p>Yingshang Telegram to Shen Bao Newspaper: The Yingshang flood and bandit disasters have been reported in the Dongyang and [name omitted] telegrams. However, the severity and horror of the bandit disaster still needs to be described in detail. In addition to looting property along the Huai River, the bandits also took away more than 500 hostages and more than 300 sailboats. The hostages and boatmen were all killed without exception. Their methods of killing were extremely cruel, including cutting off arms, cutting off legs, burning with fire, or drowning in water. The various atrocities are heartbreaking to describe. In total, the number of people who died at the hands of the bandits is no less than 2,000, on par with those who died in the flood. The grass and trees smell of blood, and the rivers flow with crimson. The bodies floating on the water are all incomplete. The sailboats move freely up and down, and no one has escaped danger. They fled in panic and were in a state of utter disarray. They had no food and no shelter, and fathers, sons, brothers, husbands, and wives cried bitterly and lost each other. How can they survive the rest of their lives? I respectfully submit this third telegram and earnestly request your newspaper to widely appeal for relief. Yingshang Red Swastika Society bows respectfully.</p>
<p>Gaoyou Telegram to Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper: Greetings. Recently sent a telegram to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association and the Jiangsu Relief Association, stating: Heaven has sent disaster, and floods are rampant. Gaoyou is the convergence point of the Huai, Yi, Mu, and Si rivers. The terrain is low-lying. Since the summer, it has been raining continuously for days, and the rivers and lakes are roaring. The 11th and 12th districts west of the lake have become a swamp first. After the opening of the three seawalls, the water rushed and the embankments collapsed. The 1st to 10th districts were completely submerged. The autumn harvest has not been reaped, and not a single grain has been collected. People and animals have died, and houses have been washed away. The rooftops and tree tops are crowded with disaster victims, barely rescued. The miserable situation of 10,000 mouths crying for starvation is imminent. I implore your association to show great compassion and immediately allocate funds and send personnel to distribute emergency relief to save those who are about to die. On behalf of the 600,000 disaster victims, I bow nine times and beg you. I respectfully submit this telegram on your behalf and earnestly request that it be published in your newspaper to widely appeal for help. The survivors left after the disaster are grateful for your kindness and virtue. County Magistrate Wang Long of Gaoyou respectfully bows and seals.</p>
<p>Harbin Telegram to all newspapers: Since the beginning of autumn, continuous rain has fallen in the southern provinces of China, and mountain floods have erupted. The Jiang, Huai, Xiang, and Han rivers have successively breached their banks, causing widespread flooding. According to newspaper reports, the flooded area covers sixteen provinces and regions, and more than 30 million people are awaiting relief. The loss of life and property is countless. All four major issues of people's livelihood, namely clothing, food, housing, and transportation, are completely trapped in a desperate situation. The dead cannot be brought back to life, and the living can only wait for death. The mainland is about to sink, and its fish are sighing. The tragic situation is truly unbearable to see and unbearable to hear. People from all walks of life in Harbin, with the mentality of being hungry for the hungry and drowning for the drowning, are taking collective action. On the 29th of this month, a joint conference was convened to discuss relief matters. The Harbin Flood Relief Association of all provinces was organized and announced on the same day. Chief Executive Zhang Jinghui was publicly elected as the president of the association, and executive committee members and standing committee members were appointed to establish general affairs, fundraising, accounting, propaganda, and liaison departments to specialize in their respective duties. The association headquarters is located upstairs in the office of the Chief Executive of Nangan in this city, and began operating on the same day, raising funds and transporting grain as much as possible. Once a certain amount has been collected, it will be reported to the Central Relief Committee for distribution to the disaster areas. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is a sincere effort to share the disaster and alleviate the suffering. The date of establishment of this association and the situation of the relief efforts are hereby reported to you by telegram. I implore you to pay attention. Harbin Flood Relief Association of all provinces bows respectfully. Dihua Jin Shuren Telegram to all newspapers: It has long been obvious to all and heard by all that the communist bandit Ma Zhongying has brought disaster to Gansu. In the summer of this year, he again used the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Allied Army to occupy the Liangzhou area of Gansu, hired foreign rogues, gathered red bandits, established a pseudo-government, and created a state of terror. He was repeatedly defeated by the Gansu army. In early July, while our defense forces were advancing to suppress the rebellious Tanguts, he led thousands of bandits to attack and occupy Zhenxi County, forcing the good people to join the gang, colluding with the rebellious Tanguts to become bandits, looting and ravaging the area. The cattle, horses, and property of the people were all branded and taken away. His cruel acts were no different from those of the communist bandits. Because of the difficult transportation in Xinjiang and the defense forces being stationed on the border, it was difficult to gather them for a while. The bandit then besieged the Hami Mining Bureau, and hundreds of miles were poisoned. Countless Tanguts died tragically. By late July, our army concentrated and advanced in separate directions. In the battles of Liaojiawan and Suzhoufang, Ma Zhongjie, the younger brother of the bandit Ma Zhongying, was killed, and hundreds of bandits were killed. In the battle outside Zhenxi City, the younger brother of Ma Heiying, the bandit's pseudo-city defense commander, was killed by our artillery. The pseudo-city defense commander was also seriously injured. The remnants of the bandits retreated to the Tianshan Temple. Zhenxi County was recovered on August 6. The rebellious Tanguts, seeing the bandit's greed and love of killing and seeing the bravery of our army, surrendered one after another. They have been granted amnesty and allowed to rehabilitate themselves, and strong men have been selected to join our army to jointly attack the bandits. I have also strictly ordered the generals of all routes to track down and suppress the bandits. They have won every battle and captured many. The bandit leader Ma Zhongying is in a desperate situation and has retreated to Qincheng, northeast of Hami, carrying greasy goods. A siege plan has been drawn up, and the extermination is imminent. It is Shuren's duty to not let the bandits harm the people and cause trouble for the government in the west and the people to be ravaged. This telegram is sent to relieve your concerns. Chairman of Xinjiang Provincial Government and Border Defense Supervisor of Xinjiang Jin Shuren bows.</p>

<p>Zhu Jiaju reports on the reorganization of university education</p>
<p>Yu Youren reports on the national disaster within the national disaster</p>
<p>Ma Fuxiang reports on the Gansu coup</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on August 31, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week in the Great Auditorium. Central Committee members Ding Weifen, Zhu Jiaju, Ding Chaowu, Fang Juehui, Yu Jingtang, Miao Peicheng, Kexing'e, Wang Boling, and others, as well as officials from various departments and guests, about 500-600 people, attended. After Chairman Ding Weifen performed the ceremony, Zhu Jiaju reported that the Party has been working hard on China's education in recent days, even in the midst of hardship and difficulty. Even in terms of national education funding, especially higher education, it has increased significantly compared to the past. However, the results of education are not developing and progressing in proportion to the increase in funding. At present, many university graduates in our country have no way out, and specialized careers feel a lack of talent, which cannot be said to be a failure of university education. The general performance of this higher examination was not good, which is a reflection of the poor performance of university education. In my opinion, to build a new country, we must first cultivate the talents needed. We must formulate a weekly, appropriate, comprehensive, and precise plan for higher education. The politics of Soviet Russia are not worth discussing, but its education plan cannot be ignored. Its current plan, which ends in the autumn of 1933, requires 440,000 engineers and middle-level engineering personnel. Among the engineers working in the Moscow industry, there are 5,264 engineers and 6,175 middle-level engineering personnel. By October 1931, Moscow alone would need 13,879 engineers and 24,882 middle-level engineering personnel. After the completion of the five-year plan, 90,000 higher specialists and 360,000 middle-level talents are needed in agriculture. Agricultural manufacturing plants require 12,000 engineers and middle-level engineering personnel. The forestry sector requires 11,600 higher specialists and 27,000 middle-level specialists. The transportation sector requires 30,000 engineers and 120,000 middle-level engineering personnel. In addition, 65,000 doctors need to be trained. In terms of normal education, efforts are being made to create 80,000 primary school teachers. The education of other countries also has excellent plans. Looking back at our country, we talk about refreshing politics, promoting industry, and striving for various constructions every day, but we have not paid special attention to the talents needed, and we have not made accurate budgets. Some people advocate starting with construction first, and waiting for construction to succeed, education will naturally develop, which is a one-sided view. If we want to do construction without seeking universal education, and without accurate budgets and preparations for higher education, it is impossible. Moreover, the current university graduates are not the talents that the country truly needs, so social stability will also be affected. The so-called construction is just empty talk. For the current plan, we must reorganize university education: (1) There is no need to take the vanity of a large scale, open more departments, set up more courses, and hire more faculty and staff to expand expenses. The most important thing is the equipment of various books and instruments, so that students can get a good foundation, arouse academic interest, and guide them to work independently. On the one hand, we must provide professors with opportunities to study advanced academic knowledge and enhance the culture of the country and society. (2) Various departments should be connected and pay attention to basic subjects. In general, university students prefer new and different subjects, and those who run schools often cater to the students' ideas. Those who study philosophy do not value an introduction to philosophy and the history of philosophy, but pay attention to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. The Department of Economics does not value an introduction to economics, but pays attention to Marx's Das Kapital. In the Department of Geology, there must be a specialized lecturer in paleontology. In the physics aspect, there must be Einstein's theory of relativity. As a result of this phenomenon, we only understand bits and pieces of advanced knowledge, but we do not understand basic and common problems, so how can we make further progress? We who run universities and educators in the country should be responsible for correcting this. (3) We must cancel duplicate courses and carefully allocate lectures to avoid putting the cart before the horse and building one house on top of another. We must also find ways to provide professors and students with frequent opportunities to make contact, so that students can have the convenience of asking and correcting questions in academic aspects, so as to arouse research interest, and also obtain considerable benefits in the cultivation of personality. (4) Strictly hold graduation examinations to avoid students with inferior grades from taking qualifications as a stepping stone for future advancement, so as not to mislead the country and society. If China wants to improve the status of university graduates, and count the talents of China, and check the results of university education, there must be a very carefully held university graduation examination, etc. After the report, the meeting adjourned at 10:00.</p>
<p>On the same morning, the National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week. Officials from various Yuan and Ministry Councils Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Niu Yongjian, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaozu, Ru Yuli, Li Shuhua, and others, and more than 200 staff members attended. Chairman Yu Youren reported on the national disaster within the national disaster, saying that he still reports on the flood today, with infinite heartache. The water level of the rivers has not decreased in recent days, and Jiangbei has repeatedly warned of danger. The people are drifting away and separating. Governments of various countries have sent telegrams of condolence, and people from various countries have started raising donations. We can only express our gratitude for this. Regarding disaster relief, there is now a Flood Relief Committee dedicated to taking responsibility. I hope that the disaster relief colleagues can very quickly help the victims. The government issued an order to all officials in the country a few days ago, and ordered the Supervisory Yuan to send personnel to various flood prevention and disaster areas to investigate political achievements. In this serious national disaster, we want to see whether the officials and those responsible for water management and flood prevention have fulfilled their duties. I put forward a slogan here, that is, senior officials go to the people. The government's decision to donate salaries to help disaster relief is to make all officials show concern for the people in times of trouble. We must not only donate our salaries, but also donate our entire heart to the disaster victims. This significance is really important. Because of this flood, I thought of the great earthquake in Japan a few years ago. After the earthquake in Japan, the government and the people, united as one, quickly made up for their losses and restored their original state. We should strive in hardship and enable our country and nation to regain happiness from hardship. This is the responsibility that the whole country should bear together. After Yu finished reporting, Ma Fuxiang temporarily requested to report on the Gansu coup. He said that the Gansu coup was sudden, and the traffic was inconvenient, and the rumors were untrue. I have talked to the press about the truth of this matter many times, but it is not detailed. I would like to talk to you about it here. (The general idea is the same as Ma's [day name omitted] telegram) He also said that Ma Hongbin is not a remnant of Feng Yuxiang. Ma Hongbin was not in Gansu at the time of the changes in the 18th year. This time, he served as the chairman of Gansu entirely to serve his hometown, not to fight for political power. The central government has its own balance on this matter, and I do not want to say more now. However, I hope that you will uphold the late Premier's legacy of equality among all ethnic groups in the country, and advocate fairness in this matter, and do not cause greater disputes by being moved by the saying of Han-Hui ethnic struggle. Finally, he also reported in detail on his work experience in recent years. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Terrible Water Disaster in Sichuan <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Countless Homes and Fields Submerged</p>
<p>Hundreds of Thousands of Victims</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: Since the beginning of summer this year, Sichuan province has been plagued by incessant rain, causing mountain torrents and a sharp rise in the water levels of various rivers. Riverside counties have become virtually submerged, devastating farmland and collapsing houses. This has left impoverished residents and small merchants along the riverbanks without shelter or means of livelihood. Cries for relief are heard daily. A summary of the disaster situation in various areas is as follows:</p>
<p>Chengdu: Heavy rain began on August 1st and continued until the next day. Low-lying areas outside the city were quickly flooded. In the Upper and Middle Lotus Pond areas of the South Gate, the water was over two feet deep. The South Gate tunnel had water reaching above the knees. Fields and roads near the Outer South Dragon King Temple to the Youth Palace were all submerged. Inside the city, the water level in the streets and alleys was also above the knees. On the 3rd, torrential rain resumed, lasting for several days. The streets inside the city were once again transformed into a watery realm. Houses collapsed, and people drowned daily. Shops in the city presented a desolate scene. Rice merchants seized the opportunity to manipulate rice prices, selling each斗(dǒu) for more than three dollars. Many middle-class families were forced to eat麦面(mài miàn) wheat noodles once a day. Poor residents could only fill their stomachs with vegetables such as pumpkins and eggplants.</p>
<p>Chongqing: The river water in the city inevitably rises every summer, but it usually recedes quickly with minor damages. However, this year, starting from August 1st, the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers began to rise. On the night of the 5th, they suddenly surged. Residents along the riverbanks were caught unprepared, their houses, food, and utensils all submerged. Some men and women also drowned. A subsequent investigation revealed a total of 500 refugee households, about 3,000 people.</p>
<p>Lu County: After August 3rd, the water levels in the two rivers rose sharply, creating a vast expanse of water as far as the eye could see. Disaster victims received aid from the Red Cross Society, resulting in few deaths. The Red Cross has telegraphed various parties for relief. The telegram roughly stated: "At the confluence of the two rivers in Lu County, the upstream water level rose sharply on the 3rd and 4th. Areas near the city, such as Shuncheng Street and Kaiba Gully, as well as Xiaoshi Xiang on the opposite bank, have become a watery realm. The water rose rapidly, leaving no time for evacuation. Disaster victims are crowding on the city walls, their cries of hunger unbearable to hear. Our society, witnessing this heartbreaking scene, quickly organized a rescue team and set out to provide assistance. Four large river rescue boats and three small river rescue boats are operating day and night, rescuing over a hundred people. Currently, during the summer vacation, all schools are closed. We have contacted schools, using the Lu County Middle School, Lu County Higher Primary School, Lu County Public School, and Lu County Model Primary School as temporary shelters for the disaster victims. We are rushing to make bread and cook thin porridge to distribute to the displaced people. However, the flood disaster is exceptionally severe, unprecedented in recent decades. Even in the areas near the city, there is an urgent need for relief. Moreover, riverside villages such as Yimin, Zhonghou, Chongyi, Fulong, Huiwen, Lire, and Fenghuang Li, where rice paddies have not yet been harvested and soybeans are ripe, have all been submerged. How will the people survive? We earnestly request the allocation of large funds to be distributed to the counties for relief, so that the withered trees can be rejuvenated and the fish in the dried ruts can be revived. This will all be thanks to the benevolence of kind-hearted people."</p>
<p>Neijiang and Fushun: Since the beginning of August, the Tuo River's upstream floodwaters have surged several丈(zhàng), with torrential currents. From Sujiawan, Yinshan Town, Tianxikou, and Lijia Street in Zizhong County, to Jiamu Town, Baima Temple, Shihui Creek, Longmen Town, Niufodu, and Shizi Tan in Neijiang, and to Fushun City, Lijiawan, Huangge Fort, Pipa Chang, Zhaohua Town, Tongtan, and Lianyu Dong, farmland and houses along both banks of the river have been washed away. Only raging waves were visible along the river. The cries for help from men and women clinging to rooftops and tall trees were unbearable to hear. However, due to the massive waves, rescue boats could not get close, so few people were rescued. Property and rice paddies floated away with the current. It is estimated that over ten thousand people drowned, thousands of homes were washed away, property losses amounted to several million, and hundreds of thousands of acres of rice paddies were destroyed, truly an unprecedented disaster.</p>
<p>Hechuan: Since the beginning of August, heavy rain has continued in this county, causing the river water to rise by seven or eight丈(zhàng). The magnitude of the flood is unprecedented in the past ten years. Agricultural products washed away on both banks reached over a hundred里(lǐ). More than a thousand houses were submerged. Farmers helped the old and the young, fleeing to nearby villages and towns. People in the county are working to provide relief. In the urban areas near the river, the people suffered even greater losses. When the water rose, many residents dismantled their houses and moved into the city. About dozens of homes were submerged and washed away because they could not be dismantled in time. Approximately fifty people drowned.</p>
<p>Tongchuan: Since August 2nd, continuous heavy rain has caused the Tong River to rise endlessly. Riverside residents and rice paddies along both banks were submerged, resulting in significant losses. The county's various agencies are organizing a disaster relief association to investigate the affected victims and devise ways to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Jiangjin: On August 4th and 5th, continuous heavy rain caused the river water to surge. Houses along the river were almost completely submerged, leaving ordinary poor people and small merchants with no place to live and no way to survive, crying out to the heavens. The situation was dire. The chamber of commerce has specially set up relief efforts, providing porridge twice a day and appealing to all parties for relief to save the poor people affected by the flood.</p>
<p>Zizhong and Ziyang: Since August 3rd, the Tuo River has risen sharply. Over two hundred里(lǐ)of riverside villages and towns in Zizhong and Ziyang counties have been submerged, turning into a watery realm. Countless fields, houses, crops, livestock, and utensils have been washed away. In particular, ripened grains, whether still flowering or about to flower, have all turned into white husks. Various miscellaneous grains have withered, offering no hope. Tens of thousands of residents have drowned. Although people in both counties are urgently seeking relief, it is like a drop in the bucket, insufficient to address the problem.</p>
<p>Suining: This county is located in the Sichuan Basin, with the Fu River running through it. Every summer and autumn, when the river floods, the banks often suffer, but the floods have not been very severe, and the losses have been minimal. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of August this year, incessant rain caused the Fu River to surge. The water inside the city reached several feet deep. Countless fields and houses along the riverbanks were submerged. In the county seat alone, over a hundred houses were washed away, and over forty people drowned.</p>
<p>The above accounts, though only from over a dozen counties, represent a region throughout Sichuan Province. The number of disaster victims reaches hundreds of thousands, with countless fields and properties lost. After enduring the ravages of war, banditry, and exorbitant taxes, the people of Sichuan are now suffering from a flood disaster, truly an unprecedented catastrophe. (August 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Breach in the Canal Embankment is Being Repaired <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Chairman Ye Chucang Personally Inspects the Disaster in Jiangbei</p>
<p>Construction Department Cables Provinces to Send Personnel to Assist in Rescue Efforts</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The situation of the canal embankment breaches has been investigated from various sources in recent days. Yangzhou and Shaobo have the most breaches, estimated at around fifteen. Fortunately, the Huaipi section near Gaoyou city in the Gao-Bao section is unscathed. The Huailou Bay and Qingshui Tan between Gaoyou and Sishui, known dangerous sections of the canal embankment, miraculously survived this time, which is fortunate. Yesterday, Provincial Chairman Ye Chucang interviewed Director Wu of the Canal Works Department, who had returned to the province from Gaoyou, for details. This morning (31st) at 6:00 AM, he set off with Director Wu of the Relief Committee, Cheng Jingsheng, and others, aboard the Yuanchang Wheel to personally inspect the upstream and downstream areas along the canal, planning to return after reaching Qingjiangpu.</p>
<p>Li Mingyang, Director of the Provincial Security Department, went to Jiangbei on the 28th of this month to inspect and arrived at Qingjiangpu on the 30th. He telegraphed the province yesterday, stating that the water level in the Huaipi section had dropped sharply. He is now rushing back to Gaoyou to find ways to repair the breaches. At the same time, Zhao, the director of the Huaipi section, also telegraphed that Rescue Commissioner Zhang Bin immediately returned to You with personnel, 麻包(mā bāo) burlap sacks, and other materials to repair the breaches. Currently, repairing the canal embankment breaches is of utmost importance. In addition to dispatching personnel to take charge of the rescue efforts and transferring personnel from other locations to assist, the Construction Department also telegraphed the Construction Departments of Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces yesterday, requesting the loan of experienced supervisors in damming and embankment work to come to Jiangsu to assist in quickly repairing the breaches.</p>
<p>Regarding the dangerous situation near Shaobo Town in the Jiangdu section, Director Shao telegraphed yesterday that rescue materials had arrived at the site in large quantities and were being rushed to repair the breaches day and night. This morning, the Construction Department sent Chief Engineer Fei Peixiang aboard the Charity Association's small wheel to Shaobo to supervise the construction work at Zhaoguan Dam. Pacification Commissioner Zhang Zhijiang also sent a battalion of soldiers to assist in the rescue efforts. With concentrated effort, significant progress is expected in a short period.</p>
<p>Note: The canal from Huaiyin and Huaian in the south to Jiangdu in the north has an east bank embankment that is higher than the houses, reaching nearly two丈(zhàng). In the event of a major flood, the Yi, Shu, Huai, and Si Rivers pour down directly. To the west are Hongze, Baoying, Gaoyou, and Shaobo Lakes, about a hundred里(lǐ) wide and four hundred里(lǐ) long. The turbulent waves冲击(chōng jī) pound, connecting the rivers and lakes. All rely on a single east embankment for protection. This time, with fifteen breaches between Gao and Shao, lake water poured out like a rapid waterfall. The rooftops and treetops were mostly submerged, and the devastation can be imagined. Moreover, the area is all plains, with no high ground. There is nowhere to escape when the flood comes. All counties, including Gaoxing, Jiangbao, Taidong, Yanfu, etc., each spanning hundreds of里(lǐ) in all directions, are now suffering this calamity. The loss of life and property is incalculable. This map is drawn to illustrate the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Water Level in Shaobo is Gradually Receding <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Repair Work Near Wanshou Palace Has Been Completed</p>
<p>Various Agencies Are Busy Assessing the Disaster and Providing Relief</p>
<p>Yangzhou Dispatch: The disaster situation of the dike breaches in Shaobo and Gaoyou has been detailed in previous reports. It is now known that the water in Shaobo has gradually receded. As of the 30th, it had dropped eight尺(chǐ) compared to its deepest level. The breach is now being repaired by Shao Fuchen, the director of the Jiangdu section, who arrived on the 29th aboard the Xinbaoyuan Wheel, loaded with 江柴(jiāng chái) Jiang-made materials. One breach near Wanshou Palace has been completed today (30th), and the second is being repaired, which is expected to be completed tonight. The news of fundraising and disaster assessment from various parties is excerpted below: (1) The Jiangsu Charity Association has sent Relief Director Yuan Xiaogu and Executive Committee Member Cao Songqiao to investigate the disaster situation in six counties, including Yangzhou. Upon arriving in the town and learning of the Shaogao dike breaches, they hired six small wheels and ten sailing boats and arrived at the Green Willow Hotel in Yangzhou on the 29th. They met with Yang Shengwu, a standing committee member of the Jiangdu Emergency Relief Association, and decided to set up a temporary office in Yangzhou to establish shelters and send all boats and wheels to distribute relief and rescue lives in the Gao-Shao-Xinghua area. (2) The Zhenjiang Navigation Association telegraphed the Emergency Relief Association here, saying that all dispatched wheels and tugboats have not returned to the town, making it difficult to continue. Please ask the Emergency Relief Group to find a way to release several wheels urgently to load and transport the Charity Association's food for relief. (3) The Shanghai Yangzhou Native Place Association sent 2,000 yuan to Ruan Mubai's contribution to the disaster relief fund on the 30th, for the use of the Emergency Relief Association. (4) The Ningbo Native Place Association in Yangzhou held an emergency meeting, recommending Wang Jingao and Feng Buqing to go to the disaster area for investigation. They first carried dry food and essential medicines, took wheels to Shaobo to慰问(wèi wèn) comfort fellow villagers, and then determined the relief plan. (5) Emergency Relief Association Chairman Wang Jingtang went to Gaoyou on the 29th for disaster relief and returned to Yangzhou late at night, bringing back more than a thousand refugees. On the 30th, Wang personally went to the province to discuss emergency relief with various parties and planned to visit Chairman Ye to explain the disaster situation and various issues related to the aftermath. (6) On the morning of the 30th, the Emergency Relief Association sent dry food to the disaster area, with 80 bags each to Gaoyou and Shaobo, 12 bags to Huangjue Bridge in the Tenth District, and 10 bags each to Guazhou and Zhongzhou Township. In addition, the Red Swastika Society and the Zhenjiang Red Swastika Society also sent personnel and wheels to transport dry food to various disaster areas for relief.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Detailed Record of the Dike Collapse at the North Gate of Gaoyou <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Most of the Houses Were Washed Away</p>
<p>Over Ten Thousand People Died Tragically</p>
<p>Water Inside the City is Eight尺(chǐ) Deep</p>
<p>Refugees Crowding at the South Gate</p>
<p>Gaoyou Dispatch: As of noon on the 25th, the water level in the canal of this county had dropped to one丈(zhàng) nine尺(chǐ). Initially, it was believed that there would be no further danger, so the authorities had stopped the work in an intangible way. Unexpectedly, at 7:00 PM that afternoon, a northeast wind suddenly rose, and the canal dike became slightly strained, but no one defended it. Around midnight, the wind suddenly turned northwest, followed by torrential rain, and huge waves directly衝刷(chōng shuā) pounded the dike. It was extremely dangerous. At this time, a jailbreak occurred in the county prison, with seventeen criminals escaping. The police team fired shots to pursue and capture them, while simultaneously closing the four city gates. Twelve people were captured, and five escaped. Because it was late at night, the residents inside the city heard gunshots and suspected that bandits had entered the city, causing great panic. Unexpectedly, at that time, the water suddenly overflowed at three locations: Miaoxiangkou, Yumatou, and Tonghu Bridge at the North Gate. Nearby residents sounded the alarm, but the North Gate was tightly closed due to the jailbreak, and the alarm could not enter the city. It was not until 1:30 AM on the 26th that the city gate was opened, and the alarm was able to enter the city. However, all shops and households suspected that bandits were using a trick, so they did not dare to open their doors. Therefore, although the alarm sounded everywhere, except for County Magistrate Wang and a few laborers on the canal embankment, no one from the shops, employees, and residents held high pole lanterns to defend the dike. The situation became helpless without lights for taking soil and rescue work. At Miaoxiangkou, Yumatou, and Tonghu Bridge, the new and old子埝(zǐ niàn) dams, which were three to four尺(chǐ) high, collapsed, each about ten餘丈(yú zhàng) in length. The water flowed directly east (Picture of dike breach at Lotus Pond, Gaoyou) like a dam was opened. Residents outside the city supported the old and carried the young, crying and weeping, and entered the city to take refuge. A small number of residents, unwilling to abandon their homes, built water pavilions and climbed up to avoid the water. After the refugees entered the city, they closed the North Gate. Unexpectedly, in less than two hours, the houses in Miaoxiangkou, Kongxin Street, and Tonghu Bridge at the North Gate were completely washed away by the water, as they were the first to bear the brunt. At this time, there was great chaos at Beishikou. All shops were looted by the poor people. The merchants in the city learned the news and immediately arrested more than ten people and sent them to the county for punishment. The market order was restored. By 7:00 AM, the North Gate area and East Street were also eight尺(chǐ) deep in water. At one time, nine out of ten houses outside the city were submerged and collapsed. Many residents drowned. Suddenly, floating corpses filled the water, flowing directly eastward, with the most miserable conditions. Many residents, seeing the rapid water, wanted to enter the city urgently but were unable to do so, so they went to Chengtian Temple Qianfo Building for refuge. However, more and more people came here to take refuge, and the pressure was too great. Qianfo Building collapsed as a result. It is said that more than a thousand people were crushed to death, which is truly tragic. At 9:00 AM, the Shuiguan at the North Gate also leaked, causing more and more panic among the people. Residents in the city also built water pavilions. By 11:00 AM, because the rescue work was ineffective, the streets in the city gradually had water. At this time, ordinary residents rushed to buy dry food and went to the city walls or water pavilions to avoid the water. At that time, the food shops were sold out. Around 1:00 AM on the 27th, because the northwest wind was very strong, Liangshiwu at the south of city twenty-five里(lǐ) and Xiaolubao in Yangzhou Prefecture suddenly collapsed, each about twenty or thirty丈(zhàng). The water level of the canal decreased significantly. The existing water level is about one丈(zhàng) six尺(chǐ). However, because the Shuiguan at the North Gate was never blocked, the deepest part of the city had reached eight尺(chǐ), and the shallowest part was about one尺(chǐ). Therefore, the residents in the city have been escaping to the South Gate, half of them hiring boats to live on the water, and the other half camping on the canal dike. It was a scene of crying, which was unbearable to hear. County Magistrate Wang believes that the water in the city is very high and will continue to rise, and he sent all the prisoners, more than two hundred, to Yangzhou by boat this afternoon (27th) to be temporarily placed in the county prison. Currently, Gaoyou City has limited food, and the people are about to starve. Moreover, the downstream water is also逼(bī) pressing the city, which is very dangerous. If the relief associations do not quickly send rescue boats to Gaoyou for relief, all the people in the city may perish together. Gaoyou City has suffered this disaster, which is unprecedented. (August 27th)</p>
<p>Another report: Wang Long, the magistrate of Gaoyou County, has escorted all the prisoners to Yangzhou for detention. It is said that they have been transferred to Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Overview of Flood Disaster in Various Counties of Hubei (Continued) <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Guangji: Due to the flooding of the Yangtze River in the county, the eighteen surrounding areas outside the Luocheng Dike, including Liu, Guo, Jia, Dai, Du, Zhou, Daoyang, Xifan, and Lujiao, were all flooded. By August 1st, the Luocheng Dike was breached, and the forty-eight surrounding areas inside the dike were also breached. As a result, villages such as Tongsi, Dongsan, Zhongsan, and Xisi were turned into a watery realm, with depths of over one丈(zhàng) in some places and several尺(chǐ) in others. People's houses were all in the water, and the suffering was truly difficult to count. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocated 276石(dàn) of relief rice and telegraphed the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>Huangmei: Before the Liu Zuokou section of the river embankment in the county was breached, incessant rain had lasted for months. All the dams were submerged by accumulated water. Disaster victims in various districts requested permits to leave the area, and their situation was extremely tragic. When the Qilu and Jingjiang Dikes in Susong were breached, Liu Zuokou was also breached. The Yangtze River flood poured into the county from this breach. The people in various民埦(mín wǎn) villages in the county, such as Wangjia Daxu and Panxingxu, and all forty-eight圩(wéi) weirs in the county, were successively breached without exception. The county seat area was also flooded. In total, more than two-thirds of the county became a watery realm, with over 200,000 disaster victims. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocated 200石(dàn) of relief rice and telegraphed the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>Yangxin: The county is located on the Yangtze River and has no堤防(dī fáng) embankments. Since spring, the water level has risen sharply. The northeast and central districts have turned into a watery realm. In addition, mountain torrents erupted, and continuous rain fell. In late July, more than 200 people died from the heat, the scorching sun, and starvation. No less than 50 people died from being crushed by collapsing houses. Those who escaped to high ground were harassed by Red bandits. Currently, tens of thousands of disaster victims gather outside the county government every day, wailing and appealing for relief. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocated 200石(dàn) of relief rice and telegraphed the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>Shishou: The county is divided into five districts. The northeast districts are entirely within the 赤化(chì huà) communized zone and have not been planted. The Gu, Xing, Yong, Gong, He, Xing, Yi Dikes and Zhang, Hui, Quan, Nan and Liu He were breached. In the central, southwest and south districts, only high-lying cities and a small number of houses can still be seen. The farmland has all turned into a watery realm. In total, it is estimated that 60 to 70 percent of the county has been affected by the disaster.

<p>Various Circles Scheduled an Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After various circles decided to refuse to read Japanese people in Fujian's news, at 5:00 PM on August 24, the Union of Maritime Workers sent instructor Pan Hongwen and staff member Wu Zantong to the Min Ribao newspaper office to persuade the printing workers to stop working because they received a notice from the Anti-Japanese Association. Unexpectedly, the newspaper office was heavily guarded by the Japanese. Hearing that members of the Union of Maritime Workers were visiting, a Taiwanese staff member disguised himself as a Chinese person to greet them. Pan Hongwen instructed Wu Zantong to wait in front of the door while he went inside to negotiate. The Taiwanese asked about their intentions and, upon learning that they were urging a strike, instigated the staff members to surround and violently beat him. Seeing that the situation was not good in front of the door, Wu Zantong hurried in to dissuade them. Pan was able to escape in the meantime. Seeing that Pan had left, the staff members imprisoned Wu. As of 12:00 AM on August 25, members of the Union of Maritime Workers, together with the chief of the 5th district and the police, searched the vicinity of the Min Ribao newspaper office but could not find any trace of him. Therefore, his life or death is unknown. After Pan escaped, he fainted on the ground after taking a few steps because of his serious injuries. Residents carried him to the 5th district, where Chief Shao Zhicheng briefly questioned him and then sent the police to escort him to the Union of Maritime Workers. The union hired Western-trained doctor Liao Pinfang to treat him. It was found that his lungs and intestines were seriously injured, his fever was high, and he was unconscious. He was given an injection to calm his nerves and relieve the pain. At that time, members of the Union of Maritime Workers rushed to visit him upon hearing the news. Seeing the situation, they were extremely angry and wanted to go to the Min Ribao newspaper office for serious negotiations. The staff of the union and the chief of the 5th district persuaded them to stop. On the morning of the 25th, Pan Hongwen's injuries worsened, he vomited blood, his voice was hoarse, and he vomited soon after drinking. Then, the Union of Maritime Workers carried him back to his home in Linghou. However, members of the Union of Maritime Workers were determined to deal severely with the Min Ribao newspaper office because one person was missing and the other was dying. They gathered in the union to plan the method, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. After receiving the report, the Anti-Japanese Association also believed that the matter was serious and decided to hold an emergency meeting at 2:00 PM on the 25th to discuss everything. Local newspapers have published huge headlines about this matter, and society is paying close attention. The attitude of the Min Ribao newspaper office is still calm, or it has something to rely on.

<p>The Baoshan seawall is in a very dangerous state. This year, floods have occurred almost all over the country. The Baoshan seawall also collapsed in several places during the hurricane and heavy rain on August 26. Fortunately, the northeast wind turned northwest that evening, preventing a disaster. However, it was still a close call. If the wind had not changed direction, the collapse of the seawall would have turned Baoshan, not to mention Shanghai, Jiading, Taicang, Qingpu, and Kunshan counties, into a swamp, and all would have become fish in a pond. The immediate danger has passed, but who knows if future storms will not be more severe than today's? It is up to the authorities and local people to manage the aftermath well.</p>

<p>Building dikes and repairing city walls. The Wuxian Agricultural and Commercial Associations believe that Wuxian County is located in a water village and that there are no dikes in the villages. Once there is continuous rain, the low-lying fields are extremely dangerous. Therefore, they have specially petitioned the county government to forward the request to the Construction Department to suspend construction for one year and use all construction funds for building dikes. Yesterday, Bureau Chief Qian of the Construction Bureau sent a letter to local gentry Zhang Zhongren, asking for his advocacy on this matter. Repairing the city walls is also an urgent matter, and he also asked for advocacy to gain the sympathy of local people.</p>

County Magistrate Shen Qingchen, currently addressing the losses from the wind disaster, reported to the provincial authorities yesterday requesting an inspection. He stated that starting from the 26th of this month, the county suddenly experienced strong winds and heavy rain, which lasted for two days and nights before subsiding. It was found that the cotton was in the boll-forming stage, and after this blow, it was almost entirely scattered. Most of the rice was still flowering, and after this disaster, it would be showy but not fruitful. The prospects for the autumn harvest are hopeless. Furthermore, countless houses and sheds in the villages have collapsed. Along the seawall, the tide rose sharply, and huge waves crashed against it. Not only were the floodgates submerged, but also many of the newly reclaimed sandy beaches were flooded. Thinking of the people's livelihood, he felt deeply chilled. In addition to consulting with the district chiefs to properly devise remedial measures, he reported the situation and requested relief.</p>

Except for Longchang Silk Mill outside Dongmen, Xishan Silk Mill in Miaogang, and Youcheng Silk Mill under Wu Qiao, which had ceased operations before the silk industry public bonds were initiated, and therefore had no right to receive the public bonds, the remaining mills could fill in the amount according to the roster and the association would issue a certificate, which would be stamped by the person and then taken to the Shanghai Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bond Fund Management Committee to verify the certificate and check that the seals matched.

The Jiangsu Provincial Relief Committee held a relief meeting in the office of the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs at 2 p.m. yesterday. Those present included Wang Yiting, Cheng Jingsheng, He Yushu, Lu Xiaobo, Ye Chucang, Hu Puan, and Xu Baoying.

<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department will divide construction zones. The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, in order to promote the balanced development of construction projects in various counties, intends to divide construction zones and convene construction supervisors from various counties for a meeting in the province. It is rumored that it was decided to divide Wuxi, Wu County, and other seven counties into one zone, with a trial run planned for next month. However, it is rumored that local people in various counties believe that the funding varies in each region, and the needs of the projects also vary from place to place. In the future, the zoning of construction will create a situation in which resources are diverted from one place to another in terms of funding, and in terms of projects, there will be concerns about ineffectiveness. The so-called balanced development will be nothing but empty words. Moreover, at a time of widespread floods in the province, after the establishment of this type of construction zone, if the existing construction bureaus are all abolished, the talents in the zone organs may not be as familiar with the local situation as the personnel in the original construction bureaus. The repairs of river works and embankment projects will inevitably result in losses in both economy and time due to the unfamiliarity with the situation. Therefore, the public opinion of local people in various counties in recent days often calls for opposition.</p>

<p>Since its establishment four years ago, the Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou Middle School has achieved remarkable results through the efforts of Principal Zhou Houku and all the staff and teachers, and has gained a prominent reputation in the domestic secondary education community. The school's moral education and teaching emphasize rigor and practicality, and there are many kinds of extracurricular activities for students, which are guided by full-time teachers in groups, with the aim of striving for social service and promoting the national spirit. In the past, when the school participated in various provincial competitions and exhibitions, the results were among the best. Recently, such as the Boy Scouts sports, have won the championship honor. The head of the Education Department and secretary inspected the school's various moral education facilities and gave many awards. Graduates of the school in the past have generally been able to pass the entrance examinations of famous universities in the country and participate in various examinations. Those who serve in the local elementary education community in the normal department are able to take responsibility and work hard, and are valued by all parties. There are no unemployed graduates. Recently, more than 80 graduates of the general department in this year's summer vacation have been admitted to the Central Jiaotong, Tsinghua, Zhejiang, Wuhan, Jinan, Jinling Universities, and Qinghan Education Fund Measurement and Verification Personnel Aviation School, Central Political School and other places. More than 70 graduates of this year's normal department have also been hired by all parties, especially those serving in elementary schools in the capital and provincial capitals. It is also heard that the school has added a civil engineering department this year, and Principal Zhou has also made considerable arrangements with provincial and county construction agencies for the future of its students. The school currently has 26 classes of high school, junior high school, and rural normal students, with 1,200 students, and nearly 2,000 students including the Experimental Elementary School and the Jingshi Experimental Elementary School. All the school's facilities strive to be down-to-earth, research and progress, and do not advocate novelty to gain a false reputation, so it can achieve unique results.</p>

<p>Lawyer Lu Jun, courtesy name Yu Fang, is a young and handsome man with deep knowledge of law. He first studied at Shanghai University and then transferred to Fudan University. At the same time, he studied law at Soochow University and was a favorite student of Professor Wu Jingxiong. Last year, he graduated and left the school. Wu returned from lecturing in the United States and formed a law firm with him in Shanghai. Before long, his reputation rose. However, Lu still felt that his knowledge was insufficient and aspired to further his studies. He plans to go to Harvard University in the United States at the beginning of this semester to study international law for a period of two years. During this period, he will also receive a fellowship from the school's Gr egory International Law program. Lu's family is not wealthy, so this trip is a great encouragement to him.

<p>Yu Tianguang Lost to Qian Yaobin</p>
<p>There were three matches yesterday, of which the battle between Qian and Yu was the strongest. The victory seemed to be in the hands of Chang Yun. When the first set began, Qian Yaobin won with a serve, but Yu Tianguang failed to rally his spirits. Until the score was one to four, he started to catch up to four to four, but in the end Qian won the first set with four to six. In the second set, Qian Yaobin again took the lead with a score of five to two, but Yu Tianguang did not dare to weaken and won five consecutive games, and thus won the second set with seven to five. The third set was the most intense, but Yu Tianguang seemed unable to exert himself that day, so Qian won with a score of four to six. Yu's loss of two points this time is quite related to the championship. Yesterday's results were as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e98">Sixty <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>People who live to sixty years old can certainly be considered old. In the eyes of modern young people, they deserve to be scolded as "old but not dead" and be subject to slogans of overthrow. However, I think otherwise. I want to stand up for the elderly and defend them. Let's compare young people and old people. Which one has richer experience? Which one has more sufficient reason? Which one has a clearer understanding of the ways of the world? Young people will definitely disagree and retort, "Even if old people have richer experience, sufficient reason, and a relatively clear understanding of the ways of the world, their energy declines. What can they do?" I say, "That's not true either. Throughout ancient and modern Chinese and foreign history, there have been many who achieved great things in their old age. For example, the famous generals in the modern European war, such as Foch and Joffre of France, Haig of England, and Hindenburg of Germany, worked hard on the battlefield and served the country, all of whom were over sixty years old. And the great American inventor Edison, even in his old age, was still diligently inventing new things. They are not only "old but not dead," but also "old but strong."</p>
<p>Life at sixty has completed one cycle of the zodiac. From the age of sixty-one, it is like returning to youth and becoming a newborn baby. All kinds of heavy responsibilities await him to shoulder, and all kinds of great undertakings await him to establish. His bright future is truly immeasurable. Today is the first day of this newspaper's 60th anniversary, and it is also like returning to youth and becoming a newborn baby. On the one hand, it does not slack off because of its age. It relies on its boldness and determination to continue its struggle to overcome obstacles. I would like to use the words "old but not dead" and "old but strong" to wish it a long life.</p>
<h3 id="e99">A Record of Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yanjin</p>
<p>The former Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi Yuko was also the president of the Minseitō. He was a reformer in politics and his ideas were novel, so he was admired by the people of his country. However, due to the global trend, the state of Japan's economic downturn did not decrease, and the number of unemployed people increased day by day. All of those folks blamed Mr. Hamaguchi. Thus, he was assassinated at Tokyo Station. Although he did not die on the spot, how could a sixty-year-old man endure such a great injury? He passed away on August 26. Fellow student Matsuda Yujiro is the beloved nephew of Mr. Hamaguchi's wife, Natsuko. He learned of Mr. Hamaguchi's situation in great detail. He occasionally talked about it after class. This is a record of the true story.</p>
<p>Childhood Mr. Hamaguchi's father, Yoshidate, was a pioneer of the Japanese Restoration. He treated his children very strictly. However, Mr. Hamaguchi had a playful nature and was lazy in his studies. Although he was repeatedly scolded, it was difficult to achieve results. Yoshidate was worried about this. It happened that his hometown of Koishikawa Kuseyama had a poor harvest for many years. The nearby residents all entered Mr. Hamaguchi's household as retainers and depended on him for a living. A certain farmer had a son who was young and eager to learn. Yoshidate valued him and adopted him as his son. He clothed him in fine clothes and fed him delicious food. Mr. Hamaguchi, on the other hand, wore his worn-out clothes and ate his leftover grain. He looked emaciated and was very unhappy. He cried to his mother and said, "Why does Father favor him and abandon me?" His mother said, "It is better to have no son than to have a son like you." Mr. Hamaguchi turned over a new leaf from then on and concentrated on his studies, progressing step by step, and eventually achieved success. It cannot be said that this was not due to his family's teaching.</p>
<p>Student days Mr. Hamaguchi studied in the Department of Politics at the Imperial University. He had never touched books on political science on weekdays. However, those who buried themselves in the library all day were pondering Chinese history and Western history. When classmates asked him, he did not hide anything and answered eloquently, "History is politics, and it is also the politics of the past. We scholars of politics should first understand the politics of the past and then attach it to the politics of the present. Only then can we produce the politics of the future." His insights were so remarkable.</p>
<p>Reign In response to the needs of the times, the Minseitō was organized. Mr. Hamaguchi spared no effort in recruiting party members. Within a few years, its influence spread throughout the three islands. Last year, in the aftermath of Tanaka Giichi's tyrannical government, Mr. Hamaguchi was elected Prime Minister after winning the election. He became even more energetic and planned to implement the salary reduction and the three major reorganization plans. He pondered deeply and thoroughly. Whenever he became mentally exhausted, he frequently struck his head. His family advised him not to suffer so much. Mr. Hamaguchi often chuckled and did not stop. It is said that he only ate two meals a day and slept only five hours.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Li the Cobbler <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>There was a cobbler named Li in Shaoxing, about thirty years old. He claimed to be from Wu County, but he did not speak entirely in the Wu dialect. His accent was a mix of various sounds, indicating that he had traveled extensively. Li set up a stall at the entrance of the house, and in addition to mending shoes for people, he also made rough shoes for sale. Every day at dusk, he would be seen holding a book, his eyes fixed on it. He was very diligent. When he was in the mood to talk, he would talk to people about the past and present, up and down, in great detail and with great interest. He always made the listeners reluctant to leave. One day, a certain Jia, dressed like a student, came to buy shoes. Seeing a book titled "Essentials of Sociology" placed on the shoe rack, he rashly said, "Do you also know how to read?" Li humbly replied, "It's just a casual pastime. I have read this book once before. There are some places that I have not fully understood, so I am studying it again." As he spoke, he vividly described the meaning of the book, unable to stop himself. Jia stared straight at him with wide eyes, hesitated, and then retreated. It is said that he did not buy the shoes either.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Xu and Wang Collaborate on Refugee Paintings <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Xu Shiying and Wang Yiting, permanent members of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Emergency Relief of Flood Disasters in Various Provinces, because of the flood this year, besides the government's allocation of funds for relief, relied entirely on the enthusiastic donations of people from all walks of life. They specially collaborated on paintings of refugees, depicting the disaster situation on white paper, with accompanying poems and lyrics, in order to print and distribute them to all walks of life, to make people feel horrified and encourage donations. The following excerpts are from their meanings, for the enjoyment of readers and to promote publicity.</p>
<p>Screen painting The painting depicts a vast expanse of water. The drowned people either only have their heads exposed and are still crying for help, or have already died and are floating on the surface of the water. On a high place, a person stands upright, looking down at the tragic scene in the water. His eyebrows are tightly locked, and he is helpless. There is a poem of seven quatrains, saying, "A painting of refugees by Zheng Xia. Wherever Geng Gui arrives, he calls for the people. Try to observe the continuous state of hardship. Drowning and starving are also due to fate." There is also a note of four large characters: "Save lives, save lives." Attached to the postscript is: "The flood disaster in various provinces this year is extremely severe. The number of displaced people is unknown. I implore those who have the power to donate and plant blessings widely." Written by Bailongshan on August 20th.</p>
<p>Vertical axis About four feet long. The painting depicts dozens of people drowned in the water country, all of whom have died. In the distance, the top of a large tree is exposed in the water, with seven or eight people perched on it. They all have emaciated faces and are holding children, who are crying. There are two poems of seven quatrains, saying, "Rain and wind suddenly came. In an instant, the water rose and submerged the building. No clothes, no food, and no shelter. Selling daughters and sons, crying sadly. The mainland is sinking, and the lives of the people are hanging in the balance. Who has the power to turn the tide? Now it is easy to plant blessings and reap the harvest. Try to buy a thousand gold to continue the life field." Underneath is written "Xinwei New Autumn. Flood disasters in various provinces. For the writing of refugee paintings, several numbers of the Bailongshan people."</p>
<p>Folding fan There is also a folding fan, prepared to be sent to Mr. Zhu Qichen, who is going to Hankou for disaster relief. On one side is recorded a poem of seven quatrains on the flood, written by Xu Shiying: "Fish under the bed, frogs on the curtain. Boat in front of the steps, car in the room. It is even more pitiful that the thatched hut is completely submerged. Only the displaced are seen, not the homes." On the other side is painted a boat, with two people inside, rescuing the disaster victims in the water. It is titled: "Traveling the road is more difficult than the road to Shu. Floating and sinking in the city, this turbulent wave. Manjushri's great vow is like a boat. May all sentient beings be safe in the high places." There is also a postscript saying: "Xinwei New Autumn. Flood disasters in various provinces. Hankou is especially severe. Mr. Qichen made a great vow to help the living. The Relief Society is raising funds. Mr. Qichen went to save them, sparing no effort. It is admirable. I made this to give as a gift. Wang Zhen."</p>

<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>My friend Zhu, his pen has a flying charm, and every time he depicts scenery, it makes people feel as if they are there, enjoying the scenery and taking care of each other, fearing that the end of the chapter will come. His writing takes shape with the object, and when he encounters a garden, he becomes a jade, like the clouds in the sky, rising and stopping unintentionally, and naturally becoming interesting. It is thought that he writes directly with his pen, without any intention. Only when the heart is free and the hands are idle can it be like this. Those who read his writing always become one with him. Du Lao's poem says, "Satisfaction is related to flying movement, and the end of the chapter is connected to the vastness." This cannot be said by those who are not good at writing, nor can it be said by those who are not good at reading. Mr. Zhu's writing is quite worthy of this. His writing includes poetry, novels, and travel notes. In ancient times, there was Li Daoyuan, in recent times, Liu Zihou, and again, the Tang Dynasty novels. One day, he mentioned the beauty of the customs and objects of the old capital and persuaded me to visit. Therefore, I wanted to imitate Lu Shilong's theory and Zhong, Bao Mingyuan's record of Lei An, to quickly express the meaning of Tu Da and chew. I held the pen for several nights and completed dozens of chapters, but I still could not stop myself. I accepted and read it, and praised it greatly, saying that there has never been such a refined and beautiful work of guidance. The above few words are written to invite others to share the same appreciation. Recorded by Chunhen on a summer day in the year 20.</p>
<h3 id="e104">燕姬 <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Miscellaneous Records of Yanjing says: (Women in the capital do not know how to weave. They spend their days applying cosmetics and binding their feet, buying meat, noodles, fruits, and other things, eating greedily as they please. Their families are impoverished. But when they go out, they are adorned with pearls and jewels, wearing fashionable clothes that fit them perfectly, appearing to be of great status). The Remnants of the Old Capital says: (Inside, there is no store of grain, but outside, there are silk and satin garments). This is because officials, gentry, clerks, and soldiers from the Ming and Qing dynasties lived here, cultivating a frivolous and decadent atmosphere. The Manchu women of the late Qing dynasty were especially criticized. Once the country was lost and their homes were destroyed, they had neither the skills to make a living nor the training to work hard. Therefore, the older ones were reduced to being servants, and the young ones were reduced to selling their smiles. Their situation was extremely pitiful. The reason for this was not something that happened overnight. Manchu women paid no attention to women's work, as mentioned above. Even in terms of adornment, they were inferior to Han women. In the past, they all combed their hair into high buns, several inches wide, made with false hair, completely losing their natural beauty, and added thick layers of makeup, creating a vulgar and gaudy appearance. Since the relocation of the palace in the thirteenth year of the Republic, this decoration has no longer been seen. Instead, they imitate Han makeup, earning them the ridicule of "imitating Handan." The ancients said that Yan and Zhao had many beautiful women, but this saying is no longer applicable today. However, Manchu women have one thing that Han women cannot match. Those from noble families are accustomed to etiquette. Their responses, advances, and retreats, their movements, and their demeanor are all within the bounds of propriety, dignified and poised. This is almost impossible to learn through mere study. Europeans value social women, and consider shyness and awkwardness shameful. This style is seen in Manchu women. They inherently possess this beautiful quality. If their pride and laziness are removed, and modern cosmetic techniques are added, they are certainly sufficient to be model women. The most beautiful of the Manchu women are often seen. It is only that they are slightly clumsy in applying makeup. Their attire is also superior to that of Han women. Therefore, the qipao has not been abandoned to this day and is instead considered convenient.</p>

<p>— By Shi Yan</p>
<p>During the continuous heavy rain a few days ago, many sections of our city walls collapsed. There are two particularly strange events in this, which I record to tell the readers.</p>
<p>When the city tower at the Great North Gate collapsed, it was about eleven in the morning. There was a continuous stream of people passing under the city wall. The collapse was so extensive that it took two days to remove all the bricks and stones. Yet, no one was injured. This is most strange. When the city tower fell, a huge brick first fell to the ground. Those who saw it told each other in alarm, "The city wall is about to collapse! Avoid it and don't walk there!" Therefore, those who were entering and exiting all ran away and stood at a distance to watch what would happen. As expected, in less than five minutes, there was a loud crash, and the entire structure collapsed. If there had not been a brick falling first, the pedestrians would never have expected the city wall to collapse and would have continued to enter and exit as usual. A tragic scene would have been unimaginable. Therefore, the falling of this brick was like the alarm bell of a fire truck, causing people to flee and avoid danger.</p>
<p>Another family lived close to the city wall. They were villagers who had come to the city to pay taxes and live there out of fear of bandits. During the continuous rain, a crack of about a foot had appeared in the city wall behind their house during the day, indicating that it was about to collapse. People advised them to move quickly. However, the villagers remained calm and went to bed that night. Unexpectedly, disaster struck at midnight. The city wall collapsed from above, completely covering their house. Under a toppled nest, how can there be unbroken eggs? Four out of the five family members died. Fortunately, the survivor was a child of only three or four years old. The villagers had come to the city out of fear of bandits, but now they lost their lives trying to escape them. How lamentable! What is strange is this surviving child. In the village, the child had been kidnapped by bandits. The bandits threatened to kill the child when their demands were not met. However, when they fired a gun, the bullet missed the child and killed one of the bandits. They shot again, but still missed. The bandits found this strange and spared the child's life. Later, the child was finally redeemed with gold. When the family returned home, they all came to the city to seek refuge, entering a haven. When the city wall collapsed this time, the child was lying in his mother's arms. The mother fell from the bed to the ground. The child followed down, but the child had been under the mother's arm. Thus, they happened to be protected by the mother's arm. The mother was instantly killed by the pressure of the wood and stones. The child was unharmed thanks to the arch formed by the mother's arm, which prevented the child from being crushed. Therefore, when they were excavated the next morning, the child was still safe and sound. Everyone said that this child did not die at the hands of bandits and did not die under the collapsed city wall. As the saying goes, "He who survives a great disaster is sure to have good fortune in the future." This child will surely have a great future. It is truly a miracle.</p>

<p>— By Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>"You fool! Why do you care about other people's business so much? Why do you have to be so earnest?" Mrs. Chen felt that Mr. Chen should not have told Mrs. Li about Mr. Li's secrets so bluntly. She blamed her husband as they were about to sleep. She felt that her husband's attitude was too foolish and could easily lead to two unfortunate outcomes. Directly, the good friendship between Mr. Chen and Mr. Li, which had lasted for years, would immediately be fractured and difficult to restore. Indirectly, it could increase the distance between Mr. and Mrs. Li, or even lead to discord due to excessive admonition. Besides, some people might not understand Mr. Chen's psychology of being upright and loyal, and might mistakenly believe that this kind of assistance to Mrs. Li was a kind of strategy with ulterior motives. Because of these excessive worries, she was very dissatisfied with her husband, even though she and Mrs. Li were also very close friends and she was very willing to help Mrs. Li leave her environment of resentment, grief, and bitterness.</p>
<p>(...) Mr. Chen remained silent. He believed that his actions were very upright, very righteous, very benevolent, and very reasonable. However, he also admitted that he was somewhat foolish. He thought: To save Mr. Li from sinking into the path of delusion and to enable the couple to enjoy the light of love and happiness forever, he had to play the fool once, which might be effective.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen himself had experienced this terrible path of delusion and had acted out many tragic stories because of it. He was an experienced person. The time when a couple is out of harmony is more bitter than suffering from eye inflammation and being exposed to strong light; it is more difficult than a hungry body walking in a dark road and encountering a great storm. He also deeply understood how resentful, grieved, and bitter a woman is when her husband is lost in a path of delusion and she desperately tries to persuade him to turn back, but to no avail, and she cannot get help in an emergency! It is like a husband falling into a mud pit, and his wife is anxious and desperate because she has no way to save him. At this time, if someone is willing to lend her a rope or a bamboo pole so that she can try to help her husband, it is a human sympathy. Since it has no other purpose and does not expect any reward, then it cannot be considered a real fool.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Gold Futures Resume Slight Decline <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲ Decline of Four Taels Yesterday, the price of gold futures slightly rebounded in the morning of the 31st, but then weakened, forming a fluctuating trend. There were more than seven taels of retracement throughout the day, and people's minds were still hesitant. Later, the price fell by four taels, probably because the silver market reported a decline yesterday, so it opened high. As predicted by our newspaper the day before yesterday, the major players sold off one after another, immediately breaking through the 80 tael mark. The foreign exchange market was slightly deficient, but there were occasional surges, as some banks entered the market and some speculators sold off. Therefore, it hovered around 80 taels. There were more buyers in the afternoon, but the exchange rate was still flat, and the situation was particularly weak. It is feared that British gold will be released for a long time, which is influenced by the fact that the US and France will provide a huge amount of loans to the UK. It is predicted that the silver market will rebound this morning.</p>
<p>▲ Fluctuation in the Morning The October opening rose by 1.8 mace, totaling 783.8 taels. Large bars and silver prices fell by one-eighth, while private telegraphs only fell by one-sixteenth. The market was also soft, and there seemed to be more buyers. Then it rose to 84.7 taels, and British gold could be sold at 75. Soon, Hengxing, Chenfeng, Yonggan, Changxiang, Yongfeng, etc., sold a lot, causing the price to fail to maintain and plunge by more than four taels, only reaching 80.012 taels. When British gold was announced as unchanged, it was 80.067 taels, but the selling pressure was like clouds, so it fell again to 78 taels. British gold was difficult to sell at 75. Then HSBC bought 8125, and the buyers on the stage slightly moved, which had been added to 80.03 taels. Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, etc. all came out. At nearly 10 o'clock, it was only 79.2 taels. Soon, Yuanxing, Yongyu, Dayuan, Dayong, Richang, etc. bought in. It was heard that a certain bank bought slightly, and Mitsui ate the October British gold at 75, so at 10:00, it was 81.5 taels. In an instant, someone Wu came to sell, and immediately went downstream. Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yong, etc. also had smooth selling intentions, so it conceded 2 taels. At 10:20, it was 71.2 taels. After entering, the buyers seemed strong, and when it was about to reach 11 o'clock, it was 81 taels. Items, etc. came out. After more than ten minutes, it fell again to 79.2 taels. Then, because the Indian exchange rate reported a small six Anna, at 11:45, it was 81.2 taels. Only the sellers were tireless, so the afternoon closing was only 79.3 taels. The posted price was still 810.06 taels, with a count of around 30 taels.</p>
<p>▲ More Sellers Gradually In the afternoon, the market opened at 78.4 taels, followed by a few qian up and down. Later, because the Indian exchange rate returned to a large two Anna, and was sold by Dadecheng, Yifengyong, etc., it was 77.2 taels. There were not many transactions afterwards, and the price was counted to have more than one tael of retracement. After 2:45, Qianchangxiang, etc. bought in, and it was heard that it was a certain bank that entered the market, which raised it to 99 taels. At 3:00, it reached 8.1 taels and returned to 9 and a half taels. After 3:30, the sellers were diligent, and suddenly became tired and weakened, depreciating by 2 taels. At 4:15, it was 77.3 taels, but the exchange rate was flat. The bank's buying price was 8125 to 875. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 78 taels, a drop of 4 taels compared to last Saturday. After the close, it retreated from 79 taels to 8 taels, and Yongfeng bought in, while Bingxing sold. According to the highest price of 84.7 taels throughout the day, the lowest price was 77.2 taels, a difference of 7 and a half taels.</p>
<p>▲ Limited Spot Transactions The early market price of goods was 3.8 qian, the afternoon closing was 79 and a half taels, 9 taels in the afternoon, and 8 taels at the close. The posted price was counted at 323 taels, with account registration at 76 and 79 taels, and water replenishment at 76 taels, 75 taels in the afternoon. There were limited transactions in spot naked bars. Only Yingfengheng received a few hundred taels, which were sold by the industry. The price was counted to be increased by 7 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Inconsistent Entry and Exit Statistics on the Table The statistics on the table show that Chenfengyong, Qianchangxiang, Bingxing, Yongfeng, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, and Tongtaichang all sold, and Yuanmaoyong sold more than 2,000 bars. Someone Wu sold the top grade. Yuanxingyong, Yuantaoyong, Yuancheng, Wanxing, Shunli, Yu Dafutai Heng, etc. generally entered more and exited less. Yuanchun, Yuantai, Chunyuanyong, Daxingyong, etc. had inconsistent entries and exits. A certain bank entered several hundred bars. In the afternoon, Tongtaichang, Dadecheng, and Bingxing all sold, and Yuanmaoyong, Yuantai, Wanxing, and Shunli had occasional entries and exits. Qianchangxiang had slightly more entries and exits, but it was heard that it entered slightly on behalf of a certain bank after 2:45. Yongfeng bought a lot, and other numbers had irregular entries and exits. The Dalian gang entered a total of 1,000 and exited a total of 1,000. The Guangdong gang had entries and exits of 400 to 500 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Large Silver Bars Show Slight Rebound <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency 31st London Telegram, The price of large silver bars rebounded. The closing price for the near term was 12 pence 875, an increase of 0625 from the previous day. The far term was 12 pence 9375, a rise of 125.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Foreign Exchange Firm, Then Slackened <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Few Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC board, except for Hong Kong adding 0625, counting 80 taels 0375, the rest were unchanged, but the domestic market was firm in the morning, and then slackened in the afternoon. It is estimated that the gold market also fell from high to low, breaking through the 780 tael mark. As a result, compared with the previous Saturday, British gold increased by 0625, US gold increased by 125, and Japanese gold fell by half a point. There were not many transactions in the Chinese market, and there was a slight sell-off of about 100,000 pounds of British gold, as Japanese banks made some acquisitions. Only about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan of US dollars were transacted, mostly between banks. There was a slight settlement of Japanese gold, but the amount was small. However, Japanese merchants occasionally sold off because the boycott of Japanese goods was serious, resulting in a lack of demand from foreign firms.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange The domestic market was counted at 125 differences. In the morning, the offer price was 1 shilling 2 pence 76875, and the buying price was 75. Mitsui first absorbed October 75, and HSBC absorbed November 8125. The Chinese-Belgian Bank ate October at the same price, and Mitsui also entered October 75. The afternoon closing offer price was 75, and the buying price was 8125. In the afternoon, Zhejiang Zhengjin bought September 8125.

<h3 id="e110">The Busy Situation of Silver Dollars at the End of the Month <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview Yesterday was Monday, and the banks opened. It was also the big billing period at the end of the month, so the collection and settlement of silver and money were particularly vast, making it impossible to investigate the detailed amount. The dollar transactions were as flat as ever, so the interest rate was sluggish and unchanged. However, the current trend in the money market is that the price outside of one mace may stand for a long time.</p>
<p>▲ Interest Rate Prices (Dollar Interest) The morning market interest rate was 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 8 hao 7 hu 5 si, and the afternoon market was 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 6 hao 2 hu 5 si. The difference between the two markets was 2 hao and a half. (Silver Interest) The morning market was 1 mace 7 fen, and the afternoon market was 1 mace 6 fen. The bank's posted price was 7 fen, and the addition of water was 89 fen. ▲ Market Conditions for Currency Conversion The early market for Jiangsu small dollars was 6 qian 5 fen 4 li, and the afternoon market fell by 2 li, making the transactions at 6 qian 5 fen 2 li. The early market was 12,000 yuan and 1 jiao, and the afternoon market was 3,500 jiao. The early market for Guangdong small dollars was 6 qian 4 fen 5 li, and the afternoon market was 6 qian 4 fen 4 li 8 hao 7 hu 5 si, making the transactions. The early market was 80,000 jiao, and the afternoon market was 40,000 jiao. The copper coins were changed to increase by 1,500 wen, which was 375,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲ Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars Yesterday's collection and settlement of silver dollars, whether banks or money houses, were vast, and it was impossible to calculate. There were more than 800,000 yuan in remittances from all routes, and the inflow and outflow of bank notes exceeded 3 million yuan. Other routine collections and settlements, as well as silver dollar public orders, etc., were more than in the past and could not be investigated in detail. Therefore, they are omitted. The early market for remittances was 1.73 million, and the afternoon market was 855,000. The early market for banknotes was 190,000, and the afternoon market was 65,000. The early market for off-exchange banknotes was 155,000, and the afternoon market was 90,000. The early market for bank trading was 700,000, and the afternoon market was 650,000. The small money houses traded more than 500,000.</p>
<p>Total Amount of Silver Interest in August</p>
<p>The silver interest rate last month was initially loose, then high, and then suddenly rose and fell. The trend was much better than in July, so the total amount for the whole month was 3 taels 5 mace 2 fen. Averaging 30 days, there was 1 mace 1 fen 7 li per day. Compared with the total amount of less than 2 taels in the previous few days, it was a world of difference. It is expected that the fixed amount of interest for this month will be 3 taels 5 mace 95 kou.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Securities and Bond Prices Continue to Weaken <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Minimal Fluctuations, Volume of Only 6.1 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday's securities market was not as good as before. The futures market was very sluggish, with few large investors entering or exiting, and small investors were also waiting and watching. The morning session saw a volume of only 4 million, and the afternoon session saw only 1.7 million, for a total of 6.1 million. The spot market was also quiet, with only 3,000 yuan traded for the entire day. Yesterday's trend of bond prices remained depressed, with bond prices showing little change due to balanced supply and demand. The sluggish situation was even worse. As a result, most prices fell slightly by two or three jiao, except for the spot price of the "20 Customs Disarmament" which fell by one yuan. The September futures of the "19 Customs" and "20 Customs", as well as the "19 Benevolence" and "Financial" futures, showed a slight rebound. The bond market situation still had no turning point.

<h3 id="e112">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Slightly Buoyant <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Sichuan Gang Merchants Actively Replenishing Stocks</p>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm due to the calmness of American cotton and the rising trend of raw cotton, which makes people's hearts even firmer. The Sichuan gang is importing coarse yarn in large quantities. Because the floods in Hankou are severe and factories cannot operate, they are actively purchasing in Shanghai. Therefore, transactions are still bustling. However, the movements of other gangs are rare. The situation in the standard yarn market is still poor because of the heavy pressure from large investors. It is difficult to rebound without special changes. However, the current environment is better, and the future will still depend on actual needs for the shift.</p>
<p>▲ Tightness of Human Label In the early market, the atmosphere was calm and the market was tight. The sellers were short of goods, and the situation was tighter. The prices of each month rose by 5.6 qian to 1.2 taels. It was heard that spot sales were still good in the afternoon, and prices rose by 4 qian. The trading volume was counted at 27,600 bales. It was found that Gongtai sold 1,050 bales, Rongxing 700 bales, Senkang 1,150 bales, and Xincheng 550 bales. Gengfeng bought 1,550 bales, Hengde 1,100 bales, and Changfeng 800 bales. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>▲ Smooth Yarn Sales Spot yarn sales are still smooth. According to statistics, all gangs bought 5,965 bales throughout the day, and 200 bales were imported among the same industry. The market was slightly firm. Among the customer gangs, Sichuan imported 3,070 bales, Tianjin imported 135 bales, the mainland imported 210 bales, Shantou imported 175 bales, Changfeng imported 175 bales, and miscellaneous gangs imported 200 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Cotton Market Bullish <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is tight and the rising trend is dramatic. With the stability of foreign cotton, there are reports of excessive rainfall. The cotton market in Shanghai is seriously affected by floods in all directions, and new cotton is greatly affected. There are also huge short positions. The rising trend is particularly sharp with slight reactions. The October flower market is becoming more and more bullish. Due to the lack of old goods, new flowers are affected by floods, and the listing is later. Buyers are buying more. However, there has been no significant change in the overseas situation. What the future holds still depends on the progress and retreat of American cotton.</p>
<p>▲ Han Label Rises by 57 Qian In the early market of the Han Label, with the calmness of American cotton and changes in the weather in Shanghai, the buying atmosphere was particularly tight, and the price of each month rose by 45 qian. The market situation was still good in the afternoon, and it rose by 5 fen to 1.5 qian. The trading volume was counted at 100,260 dan. It was found that Dafu sold 5,100 dan, Jifeng 2,300 dan, Gengfeng 2,300 dan, Yongchang 2,200 dan, and Xincheng 1,400 dan. Gongtai bought 2,500 dan, Tianlong 3,400 dan, Taixing 26,000 dan, Changfeng 5,500 dan, Dachang 2,800 dan, and Gengfeng 3,600 dan. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>▲ Mumbai There Was Little Fluctuation Last Week In the beginning of the week, due to the firmness of American cotton, there was a lot of replenishment and buying by peers. However, due to the high market price, it caused the brokers to sell off, so it soon softened. As a result, it only rose 5 rupees compared to the previous week. The spot market was very quiet, and exporters were indifferent. Because the comparison was higher, Europe did not dare to buy, and the Japanese question was extremely disappointing. The statistics for the previous week are attached below.</p>

<p>▲ Liverpool Spot Questions Were More Numerous Last Week, Especially Foreign Cotton Was the Most. In Terms of Futures, Due to the Instability of the Political Situation, Transactions Were Peaceful with Inconsistent Entries and Exits. Due to the End of the Month, the Market Price Was Firm on the Weekend, But the Market Situation Was Still Unstable. Egyptian Cotton Transactions Were Quiet, and the Market Price Fluctuated Little. The Whole View Is That American Cotton Is Shifting.</p>

<p>▲ Yesterday's Market in the South Because the Port Accumulation Is Still Abundant, and the End of the National Calendar Is at the End of the Month, the Firms Have Settled Their Accounts According to the Usual Practice, so the Transaction Is Stagnant, and the Market Prices of Each Commodity Have Fluctuated by Two Horns. The Prices of Thick Japonica and New Japonica Have Fallen by Two or Three Horns, and the Prices of Early and Late Rice Have Been Clearly and Secretly Falling. There Were Few People with Appetite for Lu Yang's Pointed Stomachs, and the Situation Was Trending Lower. The Arrival of Unconverted Shadow Dollars for Sales Was at the Original Level, and There Were About Fifty Ships Stored in the Port of Pudong, With a Total Rice Volume of About 10,000 Dan. There Were Still Stocks on the Road, and the Prices of Brown Rice in Such Places as Su Chang and Wuxi Did Not See Improvement.</p>
<p>▲ The Transaction in Xinzha Was Not Good, and the Arrival of Aonori and Thin Rice Was Limited. The Bag of Stomachs Selected Fresh Goods, and About 500 Bags Were Processed. Due to the End of the Month, There Were Not Many Movers in Retail Sales. A Dozen or So Ships of Regular Tin North Rice Arrived, and the Market Was Tired and Stagnant. There Was Not Much Change in Yangshe Pointed Rice, and the Trend of Late Rice Was High. The Secondary Soft Was Two Horns. The New Japonica New Guest Pointed Rice Arrived, and the Appetite Was Stagnant, and the Opening Was Reduced by Three Horns. Twenty or Thirty Ships Came From the West Road, About Two Thousand Dan.</p>

<p>The Foreign Firm Received a Telegram That It Was Rising</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice spot was stagnant, and the owners' minds were still firm. However, there were no local customers to clear the disaster relief, although there were inquiries, but only the low-grade goods were selected, and all were distributed by the industry, so the market was very quiet. Due to the rising prices in the producing areas, the foreign rice futures were not re-approved by telegram. The situation of returned goods in the market was very good. Five hundred tons were opened yesterday, and the price of September's small twist was 6 taels, 5 qian, and 7 fen, which was 5 fen higher than last week. The Tianjin Foreign Firm telegrammed that the first Saigon was 7 taels and a half, and the second Saigon and small twist were both 7 taels and 2 qian.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the end-of-month flour delivery. The futures market was sluggish. The total delivery of spot flour was 145,000 bags, all of which were old-brand trademarks. Other brands were directly drawn out and used to offset debts. The total amount of internal and external deliveries this time exceeded one million bags. It is said that the Foomao Xin's "Battleship" brand accounted for over 600,000 bags, the Fufeng "Cart" brand accounted for over 300,000 bags, and other scattered factories accounted for 200,000 to 300,000 bags. Half of it was handled by clients' brokers, and half was collected by stockpiling speculators.</p>
<p>August futures trading remained active, with a total of 3,563,800 bags traded. Far-term contracts were more numerous than near-term contracts. Details are attached below: (Unit: 1,000 bags)</p>
<p>August 4th: 5450. October 6th: 460. December 6th: 450. September 4th: 627. November 6th: 220. January 6th: 363.</p>

<p>Factory Ice Sugar Price Increased by 2 Candareens</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a lack of telegrams from sugar production areas to the sugar market. Public market trading was unusually quiet. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw and white sugar new product was priced at 11 taels and 7.5 candareens, with slightly higher prices shouted at 11 taels and 8 candareens. No. 20 medium white sugar was priced at 11 taels and 1 candareen. Transactions were few and far between. The market situation was relatively stable. Taikoo sugar was initially firm but later leveled off. Trading was also not very enthusiastic. "B" mark was priced at 12 taels, "CW" mark at 11 taels and 9 candareens, "DY" mark at 10 taels and 8.5 candareens, dropping as low as 11 taels and 8 candareens, "HX" at 11 taels and 7.5 candareens. There were some fluctuations, but the situation was still relatively stable. The number board shows that Zhenxiang sold 5,000 bags of old stock white sugar, priced at 11 taels and 4.5 candareens; slightly whiter bags were priced at 11 taels and 5.5 candareens. Huaxin sold over 1,000 bags of Dutch red sugar No. 9, priced at 9 taels and 5 candareens. Trading houses had a good appetite, so they were all able to clear their stock. The market seemed not weak. The factory's ice sugar, using thick-material raw white sugar, rose in price. Factory prices increased by 2 candareens. Yesterday, the market slightly sold off some stock, with No. 1 grade priced at 14 taels and No. 2 grade at 13 taels and 9 candareens. Zhenji and other China factories also sold off a small amount of stock.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the increased arrival of Lanxi honey dates, market prices have fallen again and again, and the trend is very weak. When the price fell, this newspaper predicted that it might have to reach 20 taels. Unfortunately, the prediction came true. Yesterday, ordinary bald dates were sold at 20 taels. Higher grades were priced around 21 taels, with the usual additions and deductions. However, the situation is still not stable and will depend on how sales go.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Silk and Tea European and American Silk Telegrams Did Not Change Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was still no change in the silk market. It was found that the Chinese silk telegrams sent overseas by various European firms in the middle of last week did not arrive in Shanghai. Chinese merchants also held a negative attitude because silk materials were insufficient. Yesterday, only Weicheng brought 10 packages of white factory silk to Shanghai, and Yihe and others brought 20 packages of Sichuan yellow factory silk. Prices remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Shanghai Silk Factories Preparing to Resume Operations <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Silk Public Bonds Have Started to Be Claimed Yesterday</p>
<p>All 106 silk factories in Shanghai, previously due to the depletion of capital, were unable to sustain operations and reduced machines and suspended operations. By the time new cocoons were available, only 36 factories were barely working. Because 4 million yuan of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry public bond incentive program began to be issued yesterday (31st), each factory owner brought the claim slips to the National Products Bank Silk Public Bond Fund Management Committee to claim bond certificates. However, each factory owner must start operations immediately after receiving the public bonds. Therefore, the 70 or so silk factories that have suspended operations are now hiring craftsmen to repair machinery and purchase raw dry cocoons in preparation for resuming operations. It is expected that about 70% of all silk factories in Shanghai will resume operations before the 15th of this month.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, Gaozhuang fine eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas was actively purchased by Yingzhuang, Yihe, Jinlong, Duddell, Baochang, and other firms. Trading was not quiet. Top-grade Wuyuan North Township core-extracted goods opened at 250 taels, and prices continued to rise. American firms also became more active in major transactions, but selling prices did not increase or decrease. The market conditions for other Gongxi, needle eyebrow, and show eyebrow goods all showed a stable trend.</p>

<p>Since last year, the sales of hardware by Niuzhuang merchants have been very sluggish. The reason is not the lack of business, but the manipulation by the Japanese, which resulted in the majority of market transactions being controlled by the Japanese. Since the boycott, Chinese merchants have switched to handling British and American goods, so the business in Shanghai has turned around. In the past two days, the number of goods purchased has been quite large. Among them, over 500 pieces of 7.5-candareen English steel plates were purchased at a price of 6 taels and 5 candareens. 800 boxes of 90-pound English tinplate were purchased at a price of 14 taels. 214 bars of blue lead were priced at 16 taels. 300 barrels of French "C" nails were priced at 9 taels. It is said that a considerable amount of other old iron products were also purchased.</p>

<p>Baker Discusses Wuhan Disaster Area Measures</p>
<p>The National Government Flood Relief Committee yesterday released engineer Baker's measures for the Wuhan disaster area, as follows: when the Wuchang embankment broke, over 100,000 Wuhan flood victims all fled to higher ground. These victims varied in wealth, with the majority still able to purchase their own food, while the rest were provided with congee by municipal authorities and charitable organizations to stave off hunger. Currently, local authorities have classified these victims into different levels. Those housed at Wenhua University are mostly factory workers who should be able to find work after the flood recedes. Currently, health workers are keenly aware that many women and children appear to be suffering from hunger, so congee is being distributed, but they often lag behind. A congee kitchen has now been specifically set up for these women and children, so the order in various shelters is currently very good and public funds are not being wasted.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Full Executive Committee Meeting of Emergency Relief Association <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Emergency Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces held a full executive committee meeting yesterday at 4:00 PM at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Attendees included Zhang Qun and his wife, Wang Yiting, Pan Gongzhan, Chu Huiseng, Shi Liangcai, Li Zuyu, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yansong, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, and over fifty others. Wang Xiaolai was publicly elected as temporary chairman, reporting on letters and the amount of relief funds and grain. They also welcomed the new committee members. Furthermore, the mayor's wife, Madam Zhang, and Dr. Zheng Yuxiu have established a women's group at the Commune Society, which was also welcomed. Next, the meeting discussed ongoing matters: (1) Since the association's establishment, relief funds have been sent in succession, but disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and joint efforts should continue to raise funds to meet urgent needs. Any cases of negligence in delivering relief funds should be pointed out and corrected. (2) Wu Zhihao reported that Zhu Qinglan was previously recommended as a relief distributor, followed by Zhang Zhijiang, Qu Wenliu, etc. However, there should be a report for record for those who have already distributed relief funds, and a request for allocation for those who have not yet distributed. Zhang Qun advocated for expanding the organization of this association, concentrating talent, in order to increase donations. Over a thousand donation books have already been issued, which is not few, but more still need to be issued. Now that the women's group has been established, it can undertake a number of tasks. In terms of entertainment, it can also raise around 100,000 in funds. After the women's group is established, there are many things that should be done, and it is hoped that everyone will contribute their opinions so that they can be written down. We have established this large-scale organization, and if we cannot raise large sums of money, then if the funds raised by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce are more than ours, not only will we let down the disaster victims, but we will also bring international shame. (3) Wu Zhihao proposed nineteen fundraising methods, and recently, together with Pan Gongzhan, will convene various industries to hold a meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. As for the method of raising large sums of money mentioned by Mayor Zhang, it is urgently appropriate to put it forward for discussion. (4) Chu Huiseng reported on the situation of the education sector meeting today. (5) Zhu Qinglan reported that he returned from Hankou three days ago. Roughly, after departing from Nanjing, he passed through Wuhu and Jiujiang to reach Hankou. He did not see the edge of the river along the way, only mountain peaks were exposed, and there was water immediately below the mountains. The rest were small hills and rooftops. After arriving in Hankou, people were travelling everywhere in small boats. Mosquitoes were rampant and the stench was overwhelming. There was no trade in the market. Only the next morning did he see people selling snacks. Large and small households were riding in small wooden basins, vying to buy. Anyone wading in the water had to place what they were carrying on top of their head to avoid getting it wet. There are a total of 104 shelters in Hankou. The food and noodles are still good, and there was only one death, which was immediately buried. If the flooding continues like this, it will inevitably lead to epidemics. Yunmeng County was inundated by the Xiang River, with water ten zhang high. The head of the water rushed past like ten thousand horses, and the people and livestock of the entire county went with the waves. Over a thousand workers in Hankou have no work to do, which feels especially dangerous. Except for a few three- or four-story buildings, the rest are all submerged in water. It is now planned to use large belts to pump water. After returning to Shanghai, he heard that Gaoyou and Shaobo were both submerged, so he immediately took the opportunity to go and inspect. There are over ten breaches in the Grand Canal, and the water is still flooding into the embankments. There is little water inside Gaoyou city, but a lot of water outside the city. The disaster situation is indeed serious. Further north to Jieshou and Sishui, there was also flooding. Baoying was better, but Xinghua was severely flooded. Only below Gaoyou did he gradually see plains. This is the general situation. It is planned to send people to investigate in detail again, and it is especially necessary to fill in the dams first, otherwise the water in the Grand Canal next spring will pour out and there will be no spring plowing. People must be sent there tomorrow. (5) Wang Yiting reported that he went to Hangzhou by early train the day before yesterday to go to the provincial government. He learned that 21 counties have been affected by the disaster, and the mulberry fields in Wuxing, Changxing, Wukang, and Yuhang have all been flooded. Currently, emergency relief is being carried out on one hand, and post-disaster reconstruction is being planned on the other. He then went to the Zhenjiang Civil Affairs Office to liaise, and a temporary Jiangbei Flood Relief Association was established. Shelters have been established in nine places, and more are being added. The number of people is difficult to calculate at the moment, but the relief funds are too small. He hopes that Shanghai will provide assistance. Shanghai has already allocated 20,000. The Civil Affairs Office has received reports of disasters in 54 counties in Jiangsu Province. Xinghua, Jiangpu, Gaoyou, Shaobo, Baoying, Rugao, Funing, Huai'an, Huaiyin, Xiao County, Taixing, Gangshan, Siyang, and Liuhe counties are particularly serious. The provincial government is planning emergency relief. (6) Nie Lusheng reported that the disaster situation in Hunan Province is no less severe than in Hubei. Due to the overflowing of Dongting Lake, 5,000 mu of land in the province cannot be harvested. He hopes that the government will allocate funds to build lake embankments to prevent future disasters. (7) Zhang Xiaolin reported on fundraising methods (currently only over 310,000 yuan has been raised, which is not enough to relieve the disaster victims in Jiangsu Province alone). He is willing to work together with one heart and one mind, and not fall behind the 5 million raised by the Japanese. (7) Shao Ruxin reported that it is planned to raise funds under the item of housing donations. Zhang Qun said that we should not force people to donate. In the past, the government assigned public bonds under the item of housing rent, which caused various troubles. Chu Huiseng suggested asking the Real Estate Association to voluntarily donate. Li Zuyu reported that this was discussed during the design team meeting, and it may not be easy to do. Zhang Xiaolin suggested inviting those with real estate present to take the lead in donating, so as to wait for others to follow suit. Qiaoshaofu donated one month of rent from the Houjiabang property, Du Yuesheng donated two months of rent from the Marong Road property, Wang Xiaolai donated one month of rent from the Taiyuanfang property, Huang Hanzhi donated over 500 taels of rent from one month of property for relief, Wang Boyuan donated over 1,000 yuan of rent from one month of the Yuanyuli, Jingxingli, Danfengli, and Jiufuli properties in Hongkou for relief, and Shi Liangcai donated one month of rent from the Shenbao property for relief. (8) Mayor Zhang's wife, Madam Ma Yuying, reported on (A) holding a tea party to solicit donations, (B) borrowing the Dahua Hotel for two days for a costume dance, and the association will send donation books, (C) inviting Madam Yang Xiaotang, Madam Pan Zhiquan, Madam Guo Anci, and Madam Tan Yasheng to join the dance. Li Yujie proposed donating funds to guests at the exchange. Wen Lanting reported that the exchanges are already proposing to raise funds, and 28,000 yuan has already been turned over. (9) Ren Jinpin and Xu Huiseng proposed telegraphed support for the 80 million public bonds to the Legislative Yuan. A proposal was also made to urge the government to promote Zhang that the proposal to issue public bonds was made by Song Ziwen, and the amount of increase or decrease was also proposed by Song. This is a political issue, which can be conveyed to the Central Relief Committee by Zhu Qinglan. It was resolved to hand it over to the Standing Committee for discussion. (10) Pan Xulun proposed that the association's work should set up more sub-meetings, which was resolved and passed. (11) Wu Zhihao proposed sending a telegram to the National Government to implement the cigarette tax increase case, which was resolved and approved. (12) The chairman asked the various committees to actually attend meetings to work. (13) It was resolved that each group would recommend a director, and it was decided that Wu Yun was recommended as the director of the finance group, Zhang Zhuping of the propaganda group, Zhu Qinglan of the relief group, Xiang Songmao of the medicine delivery group, Wen Lanting of the audit group, Zhang Xiaolin of the fundraising group, Li Zuyu of the design group, and the general affairs group was handed over to the Standing Committee. (14) The proposal to add permanent members to the Standing Committee was decided to add Qu Wenliu and Xu Jingren as executive directors. (15) The propaganda group proposed an external English name as China Flood Famine Society, which was resolved and passed.</p>

<p>The Yangzhou Eight Counties Native Place Association convened a full executive committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Shen Dingchen, to discuss (1) The chairman reported that Xue Ganchen and others have raised over 1,000 bags of flour. In addition to being shipped in batches, they are currently continuing to raise more. Furthermore, Gu Deguang and others have jointly purchased cooked food to transport to the disaster area. The association has sent a letter to the Yangzhou Chamber of Commerce requesting their care. (2) Yesterday, the various committee members handed over 2,500 yuan raised in one day to the association. Fundraising is still ongoing, and it was resolved to publish the list of donors in the newspaper every seven days to express gratitude. (3) To handle emergency relief, the various committee members should take special responsibility. Shen Dingchen, Xu Fuchen, and Ruan Mubai were publicly elected as the general affairs group, Li Zhixi and Chen Yangnian as the economic group, and Song Shixiang and Qian Shusheng as the document group. They will go to the association every day to take on their respective responsibilities.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Hubei Relief Association Shanghai Office Established <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Hubei Flood Emergency Relief Association's Shanghai fundraising office held a banquet for all sectors of society at the Daguanlou on Fourth Road the day before yesterday (30th) to raise funds for emergency relief. Over 70 guests attended. Chairman Jiang Zuobin attended the meeting despite his illness. He first thanked the guests, saying that although Zuobin had not personally visited the disaster area, he had learned from his fellow villagers in detail that the severity of the disaster was truly unprecedented. The cries of the hungry are everywhere, and relief is urgently needed. Zuobin humbly pleads on behalf of all the suffering compatriots, and deeply hopes that all philanthropists and fellow villagers will do their best to assist and wish them boundless blessings in the future. Then, Mr. Liu Zigu reported on the establishment of this office and the crisis of the Hubei disaster and the disaster victims. After the report, the meeting discussed requesting the press to vigorously promote the disaster situation, preparing for soliciting calligraphy and paintings to help relief, and various fundraising methods. Then, Mr. Wu Guozhen, Director of the Hubei Department of Finance, gave a speech on the disaster situation in Hubei, saying that the long-term cause of the Yangtze River flood was the blockage of the waterway. He noted the Wuhan flood during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, which was about 60 years ago, where the water level reached 50 chi and some inches, and was already considered an extremely large flood. Unexpectedly, the water level this year reached over 53 chi, which is truly rare. According to county records, a major flood was seen once 600 years ago. At that time, there was no water level to record, but what can be verified is the saying that only the Turtle and Snake Mountains were visible in Wuhan. The scale of this year's flood is so large that from afar, only the Turtle and Snake Mountains are visible, or even worse than the major flood 600 years ago. It is truly an unprecedented disaster. The disaster area outside the province covers 45 counties. From Hankou to Wuxue, it is a vast expanse of water. As provincial officials, Guozhen and others are at fault for not preventing and rescuing. However, the flood this year was so torrential that rescuing five or six chi, the water reached seven or eight chi and the embankment was breached. It was impossible to prevent. Such a peculiar flood cannot be resisted by human power. There are approximately over ten million disaster victims in the province. The three towns of Wuhan are trapped in deep water. There are approximately over 400,000 people who have no food or support. He hopes that all parties will rush to raise emergency relief to save the current situation. Guozhen and others will again submit a statement to the central government to strive for post-disaster reconstruction. Today, all of you present are working hard for the disaster victims, showing your sincerity. He earnestly asks for your enthusiastic support to save these dying victims. The speech ended at 9 o'clock before everyone dispersed.</p>

<p>Chairman of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Wang Peiyuan, received a telegram from Li Zushen yesterday, saying: (The water level in Hankou has decreased, and epidemic prevention should be prepared urgently. Please come to Hankou quickly, and everything will be discussed and handled, with utmost anticipation, Li Jin.) He also received a telegram from the Hankou branch saying (Received your letter, knowing that your society will soon organize an epidemic prevention team to come and carry out injection and epidemic prevention work, the sincere, benevolent, and practical relief to the disaster victims is admired, special telegram to welcome, Hankou Red Cross Society President Wang Senfu Director Wang Minpu Yan kowtow).

<p>To the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association of the Various Provincial Flood Relief Associations, transferred to Mr. Jin Xingren, Mr. Cheng Yiqing, and the gentlemen of both associations. In Jiangdu North, the Shaobo Town Gaoyou area, over ten breaches in the embankment occurred on the 26th of this month. The entire city, the entire town, and the various counties of the Lower River were flooded. Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 residents drowned. Gaoyou City was also flooded on this day, and approximately 70,000 to 80,000 residents drowned. Currently, millions of lives in the downstream counties of the Grand Canal, such as Xinghua, Dongtai, and Suxian, are already in dire straits. This kind of flood is truly rare in thousands of years. The residents of Shaobo and Gaoyou who escaped the danger have climbed onto the city walls and elevated river embankments and rooftops, urgently awaiting rescue. After hearing the news, this office immediately dispatched Councilor Zhang Ruitang, carrying wheel boats, civilian boats, supplies, and many staff and soldiers, to rush to the disaster area day and night for rescue. However, the rescued refugees are crying out for food, urgently awaiting relief. In particular, I urgently request your association to grant more relief to rescue the refugees. Details will be presented in person. Your brother Zhang Zhijiang Zhang Shusheng kowtows.</p>

<p>▲Fundraising Declaration This year's continuous rain has caused disasters, and floods have overflowed. Areas such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei have been submerged for months, and the floodwaters have not subsided. The Yellow River has also burst, causing dangerous situations in Hebei and Shandong. Levees have collapsed in Gao and Shao, one after another. The affected areas span sixteen provinces, with sixty million victims. The dead are buried in the bellies of fish, and floating corpses drift with the waves. The living eke out an existence, sleeping in the open air and eating in the wind. Seedlings are submerged, livestock and people drift away, cities have become swamps, and fertile fields are now lakes. This unprecedented catastrophe is unparalleled in history. Currently, hundreds of millions of disaster victims urgently need relief. Driven by compassion, the members of this association cannot bear to sit idly by. We have organized a disaster relief donation team, appealing to compatriots from all walks of life to have the heart of those who are already hungry and drowning, to uphold the righteousness of being crowned and clothed, to generously open their wallets, and enthusiastically contribute. Let's gather sand to form a tower, collect fur to make a robe, so that hundreds of millions of wailing disaster victims can return to their mats as soon as possible. We are extremely eager to implore and pray. This declaration is hereby made, and we hope for your public understanding.</p>
<p>▲Start of Fundraising After the team is established, it is planned to start work immediately and raise funds in various districts.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Xiang Xiang Pleads for the Disaster Victims <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>When Mr. Xiang Xiang was in New York, USA, he had a previous acquaintance with President Hoover. Due to the severity of the floods in the country, he recently sent a telegram to Washington in his private capacity, asking for surplus cotton and wheat to help with disaster relief. The main idea of his original telegram is translated as follows: (Omitted above) Hot and turbulent weather waves reverse and attack the Great Snow Mountains of the Western Sichuan Plateau, flowing eastward. The river basins of major rivers, taking the Chinese plains as their outlet, overflow simultaneously. Combined with the impact of tides and flash floods, dams are completely destroyed, and houses are gone. The disaster area covers sixteen provinces, and 50 million disaster victims are immersed in water, crying out and waiting to die. This is truly an unprecedented catastrophe in our country. Our government and people have already cooperated in providing urgent relief, but because the disaster area is vast, we fear that our efforts may fall short. In the blink of an eye, winter is approaching, making hunger and cold even more difficult. Without large-scale work, it will be difficult to achieve effective results. This year, Germany faced a gold shortage and was granted a one-year postponement of war debts, allowing them to breathe a sigh of relief. This righteous act has been admired by the world. Currently, our country is facing an unprecedented flood disaster, which is of even greater importance. We also implore the benevolent people of this God, to advocate to all sectors of society, to make a grand wish to use your country's surplus cotton and wheat to provide as much assistance as possible, and to unite philanthropists around the world to carry out large-scale relief and direct reconstruction, further promoting the spirit of a great nation. Charity knows no borders. Therefore, I dare to plead for the lives of 50 million disaster victims. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>▲Shipping Losses in the Flood</p>
<p>Inland Steamer Services Suspended Again</p>
<p>Water Damage to Shanghai Warehouses</p>
<p>After the hurricane this time, Shao Bo and Gao You suffered</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>another major flood, with fields and homes submerged, people scattered and displaced, and deaths piled high. Relief efforts are underway, but Shanghai's inland and offshore merchant ships have also been greatly affected. The information heard is recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲Small Steamers Suspend Operations to Rescue Disaster Victims This time, the embankment at Shao You broke, causing many deaths. The disaster has also spread to Dongtai and Xinghua. There are still many disaster victims living on high mounds and treetops, waiting to be rescued. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has ordered the Emergency Relief Association to requisition small steamers and civilian boats to go to the Shao You area to transport and rescue refugees. The Shanghai Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other inland river shipping companies have resumed services on the Suzhou-Hangzhou line, Changli line, Xi Li line, Xi Cheng line, and Xi Xuan line. All small steamers have been temporarily seized by the Water Disaster Relief Association. The company's ships have also been requisitioned and sent to Shao You, Dongtai, and other places to transport disaster victims to ports such as Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai. Therefore, small steamers on the inland rivers of Jiangsu Province, which had been suspended from July 6th to the end of August and had just resumed operations once or twice, are now completely suspended again. Yesterday, the Shen Su line's small steamer was afraid of being seized en route, so although the cargo was fully loaded, it did not dare to set sail.</p>
<p>▲Losses in Inland Waterway Shipping This time, the major flood disaster in Jiangsu and Zhejiang caused the Shanghai inland river shipping companies to suspend operations for two months. The other day, when the strong wind and rain occurred, the Merchants Steam Navigation Company's wharves in Zhenjiang and Hangzhou were also destroyed by the flood. Yesterday, Mr. Gu of the company told reporters that the total loss of the Merchants Steam Navigation Company's head office and branch offices in the inland rivers due to the major flood disaster in July and August reached 100,000 yuan, and there is still no hope of resuming operations. Other shipping companies have also suffered the same losses. It is estimated that the total loss of the various shipping companies due to this natural disaster is at least 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, which is truly a major catastrophe for the shipping industry.</p>
<p>▲Yichang Steamer to Sail to Shanghai Today The Taikoo Yichang Steamer ran aground in Hongguan Bay outside Xiamen during the first hurricane on August 14th. It was able to sail out after 12 hours. After arriving in Xiamen, it loaded cargo and passengers and sailed to Shanghai on the 24th. It encountered a second hurricane while sailing on the sea off Fuzhou. Fortunately, the shipowner took precautions, and the ship ran aground on the sand in the shallow waters of the Min Sea. On the 26th, after the wind subsided and the waves calmed, it managed to sail out on its own. Because the hull was slightly damaged, it returned to Xiamen. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from the Yichang Steamer, reporting that it is now undergoing minor repairs in Xiamen. The cargo and passengers were not damaged during the grounding. After the repairs are completed, it will immediately sail back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Guangli Steamer Fortunately Escaped Danger The Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangli Steamer encountered a strong wind while sailing from Shanghai to Fujian on the sea off Wenzhou. The shipowner, Teng Shibiao, quickly dropped both anchors into the sea to anchor and avoid the wind. Unexpectedly, the wind and waves were too strong, and the ship's hull was pushed, causing it to run aground on the beach. The shipowner sent out a distress signal. At that time, the Sanbei's Wanxiang Steamer and the Japanese ship Longchang Maru passed by, but both were unable to come to the rescue due to the dangerous wind and waves. The passengers in the ship were extremely panicked. Fortunately, the business director and the naval police on board tried their best to comfort and maintain order, which turned danger into safety and prevented any accidents. When the wind gradually subsided and the waves also stopped on the 26th, the ship was able to sail out of the shallows with the tide due to the shipowner's efforts in the face of difficulties. It has now safely arrived in Fuzhou, and the cargo and passengers are all safe. A special telegram was sent yesterday, reporting that it will leave Fujian and return to Shanghai immediately. After arriving in Shanghai, the bottom of the ship will be inspected for any damage to facilitate repairs.</p>
<p>▲Inventory of Water Damage to Warehouse Goods Due to the major flood in this city the other day, the warehouses in Pudong and Puxi and along the Suzhou River, as well as the docks and police stations of various shipping companies, were flooded. After days of pumping and drainage, the water has been completely discharged. The various shipping companies have identified a total of 160 large and small warehouses that were flooded, and the total value of the cargo damaged by water is estimated at 750,000 yuan. Various warehouses are still in the process of clearing and inspecting the goods these days.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Bank of China Establishes Osaka Branch <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Talks with Zhang Gongquan</p>
<p>Opening Scheduled for Today</p>
<p>The Bank of China has recently established a branch in Osaka, Japan, and is scheduled to open today. The manager of the Osaka branch is Ju Yirong, the current deputy manager of the Bank of China's Shanghai branch, and the assistant manager is Zheng Boling of the Kobe Netherlands Bank. Both are familiar with Osaka's business. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency visited Mr. Zhang Gongquan, the president of the bank, in his office yesterday, and he gave the following statement. According to Mr. Zhang, China and Japan are separated by a strip of water, and transportation is convenient. Moreover, due to various historical relationships, commerce between the two countries is particularly developed. Judging from the recent five-year customs reports, it is of great benefit to Japanese merchants engaged in Sino-Japanese trade. Furthermore, among Japan's exports to China, cotton yarn and cloth account for the largest proportion, followed by manufactured goods such as seaweed, medicines, steel, and machinery. Among China's exports to Japan, rapeseed, hemp, medicinal seeds, leather, and hair are mostly raw materials. Osaka is the center of Japan's industry and is close to Kobe. All cargo handling is concentrated here, so Chinese merchants gather here. According to recent estimates, there are about 3,000 Chinese merchants in Osaka, representing various industries, mostly yarn, cloth, and sundry goods merchants. According to the bank's estimates, the total amount of this direct trade is around 120 to 30 million Japanese yen per year. The inconveniences felt due to the lack of a domestic financial institution to mediate this large amount are as follows: (1) Differences in language and customs often hinder transactions. (2) Japanese merchant banks are inevitably unfamiliar with the situation of Chinese merchants, and sometimes the conditions are too harsh, making it impossible for Chinese merchants to meet them one by one. (3) Japanese or other foreign banks do not understand the true situation of Chinese merchants. Therefore, when there is a risk, they all rush to close accounts, even cutting off contact altogether, which causes Chinese merchants great pain. (4) Chinese merchants come from all over the country, especially from the north. Japanese merchant banks only handle remittances to major commercial ports and cannot penetrate the interior of China. Therefore, remittances are still inconvenient, and there are many losses. In order to alleviate the above-mentioned difficulties, Chinese merchants in Japan all hope that there will be a bank with strong capital, outstanding credit, branches all over the country, and smooth remittances to establish a branch in Osaka to facilitate turnover and achieve mutual benefits with Chinese merchants. Furthermore, considering the content of Sino-Japanese trade, between Japan and central and southern China, China exports more to Japan and Japan imports less to China. As for Japan and northern China, China exports less to Japan and Japan imports more to China. The reason why China imports more from Japan lies in the fact that the north exports less and imports more. The reason why the north exports less and imports more lies in the inconvenient transportation in the north. The import of local products from the north passes through Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei. Apart from the occasional automobile roads and boat transportation, the rest of the transportation completely relies on the power of people and animals. It often takes years to reach, which greatly hinders the sale of goods. If there is a bank to provide long-term assistance, the export of local products will definitely develop due to increased convenience. In order to satisfy the hopes of Chinese merchants and promote the development of exports, the Bank of China has the qualifications for this purpose. Therefore, after repeated negotiations by Yu in the past and with the assistance of Japanese colleagues, we finally obtained the understanding of the authorities and obtained a license in February of this year. After several months of preparation, we are scheduled to open tomorrow (i.e. today). This will not only benefit commerce, but also bring glory to the country's image.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Tao Baichuan's Speech on National Self-Salvation and Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Day Before Yesterday at the Great China Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>(National News Agency) The Third District Party Headquarters of this city, in order to promote party ideology, invites prominent figures from the party and government circles to give lectures on the Three Principles of the People every Sunday. The day before yesterday, they specially invited Tao Baichuan, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, to give a speech at the Great China Electrical Company's radio broadcasting station on Nanjing Road, entitled "National Self-Salvation and Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese." The following is an excerpt of the main points of his speech: China is a semi-colonial country, even worse than the annexed Korea and Annam. Because Korea and Annam are only slaves to one country, Japan or France, but China is not; it has to be a slave to many countries. Therefore, in order for the Chinese nation to be independent and equal, and to break away from the oppression of imperialism, the 400 million people must rise up and save themselves; they cannot rely solely on the Chinese Kuomintang or the National Government. China's biggest enemy at present is Japanese imperialism. Because their industries and commerce are very developed, their capital is abundant, and domestic production exceeds demand, they are trying their best to expand abroad. However, the countries of Europe and America have no room for them to intervene, so they have no choice but to attack China, whose industry and commerce are underdeveloped and whose capital is declining in the East. Recently, because Japan instigated Koreans to massacre our overseas Chinese, the national sentiment boiled over, and anti-Japanese and aid-to-overseas-Chinese associations were organized to implement boycotts of Japanese goods and economic severance with Japan. However, we cannot entrust the responsibility of defeating Japanese imperialism completely to the staff of the anti-Japanese and aid-to-overseas-Chinese associations; all 400 million people must take responsibility and attack Japan in unison in order to eliminate Japanese imperialism, and then the Chinese nation can be saved, and so on.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Farmers' Association recently received a report from members Li Shengda and others stating that the He Po Tang River in the Fourth District of Pudong County is connected to the Shen Zhuang Tang River in Nanhui County. The river is very long, and the farmland on both sides relies on it for irrigation. Recently, the river has been silting up severely. If there is a drought, there will be no way to remedy the situation. They requested that it be dredged to benefit agriculture. The association then reported the situation to the county government, which yesterday ordered the Construction Bureau to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association Sends Another Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "To the honorable department, according to a letter from taxpayer Mr. Ye, the Public Works Department's collection of municipal general donations from our Chinese people is unfairly biased. No prior notice is issued for consultation. Your council resolved that future payments should be made within 14 days after receiving a formal notice from the Public Works Department. Your council published a notice to the citizens in the newspaper on May 28. On July 1, the Public Works Department published a notice in the newspaper, canceling the notice. Regardless of Chinese or foreigners, future donations will be collected after the Public Works Department publishes the date in the newspaper, and people should go to pay on their own. Up to now, no response has been seen from your council. Yesterday (August 26), the bureau sent Westerners to our office to collect donations. In order to implement your council's resolution, I refused to pay. Unexpectedly, the bureau suddenly sent a notice today. This is inconsistent and contradictory, and it is clearly discriminatory against the Chinese. Your council is a representative of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers in our city. What is the course of action for the above notice? I think you have already set a concrete plan. Please give instructions so that we can follow them. I support your council's power. Even if there is any sacrifice to benefit our taxpayers, I will not hesitate." It also attached a copy of the donation notice to the meeting for investigation. Regarding the collection of municipal general donations, your bureau should issue notices uniformly for both Chinese and Western-style houses to show equal treatment. Our association has repeatedly sent letters to implement this. Regarding the 14-day deadline for the notice received by our association, the red pencil has already been crossed out. Whether other Western-style houses are handled uniformly, please pay special attention to your bureau. According to the letter, your bureau has not yet handled the issuance of notices for Chinese-style houses uniformly, which is not consistent with the statement of "no discriminatory treatment." It is appropriate to send a letter to your bureau requesting prompt handling to avoid complications.</p>

The engine has been converted to use fuel. The hull of the ship has been completed and will soon be launched. Currently, the senior crew members of the three ships are all Westerners. Now that the new ship has been completed, the Customs Office has decided to completely replace them with domestic navigation professionals, from the captain down, as a sign of reclaiming navigation rights.</p>

<p>Requires 150,000 Yuan</p>
<p>After the seawall in the Wusongkou Baoshan area was damaged by the tide on the night of August 25, although emergency repairs were made, the danger is still very worrying. Yesterday, Zhao Enju, the magistrate of Baoshan County, convened a special meeting of various agencies to discuss the issue. It was proposed to request the provincial government to allocate a huge sum of money for the Seawall Engineering Office to repair it seriously in order to strengthen the seawall and avoid disasters. It was resolved that the local agencies would send telegrams to the provincial government, requesting the immediate allocation of 150,000 yuan for emergency repairs and the formulation of a thorough repair plan. At the same time, Gu Zhenyi, Ji Zhonghe, and Pu Weirun were elected to go to the province to petition, and a seawall protection committee was organized. Then at 2 p.m. yesterday, Magistrate Zhao, together with Xue Zhaoshu, director of the Seawall Engineering Office, and Tan Juenong, director of the Construction Bureau, and Wang Qingtao, the head of the First District, went to the seawall to conduct an on-site inspection. The Wusong Fortress's various forts are built along the seawall, so this time they were also damaged a lot. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Military Affairs to send personnel to inspect, Commander Deng also sent letters to the Seawall Engineering Office and the Shanghai Public Works Bureau yesterday, requesting joint emergency repairs, and sent his adjutant Li Tang to make contact in person. The northern and southern forts of the fortress are within the scope of the municipal government, while the Shizilin Fort is under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County. The length of the damaged sections along the seawall and the dangerous situation of the existing seawall surface are recorded as follows: Chenhua Beach section, 140+ zhang damaged, more than 3 zhang breach; Gu Longdun section, 200+ zhang damaged, 20+ zhang breach; Zhangjiazhai section, 200+ zhang damaged, 30+ zhang collapse; Xuejiatan section, 200+ zhang damaged, 30+ zhang breach; Niutoujing section, 80+ zhang damaged, 10+ zhang breach; Beishidong section, 80+ zhang damaged; Wuyuedun section, 150+ zhang damaged, 10+ zhang breach. The above dangerous sections total more than 1,000 zhang. The narrowest part of the seawall surface is only 3-4 chi. All the breaches are temporarily blocked with old stones. Thousands of wooden piles are broken, and countless soil and stones have collapsed. Other sections are also damaged, totaling thousands of zhang, but no danger has yet occurred.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Parking Lots to be Built on Prosperous Roads in the French Concession <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Pay a Small Fee Each Month</p>
<p>Someone to Take Care of It For You</p>
<p>The "China Press" reports that the French Concession Vehicle Department, in view of the increasing number of cars in this port and the rapid development of street traffic into a serious problem, has recently paid close attention to the management of cars and the improvement of street traffic. According to the registration of cars in the French Concession Public Works Department, there were only 95 freight cars and 1,591 passenger cars in 1925. This year, the number of freight cars has reached 1,965, and the number of passenger cars has reached 3,991, which shows the rapid increase in the number of cars in this port in recent years. As a result, the number of traffic accidents in the streets has also increased year by year. The reason for the accidents is mostly due to the overloading of freight cars and the parking of cars on narrow streets. Therefore, the department recently ordered that vehicles are not allowed to park on the southern end of Avenue Joffre and Route de Cercle, etc. The results have been quite good since the implementation. However, the lively roads such as Avenue Edward VII and Rue Cardinal Mercier lack places to park vehicles, and cars are also very inconvenient. Therefore, the department is now planning to build several parking places. Car owners can park their cars there for a small monthly fee. Someone will take care of it and provide the convenience of supplying gasoline. In addition, it is also planned to formulate special regulations that all car drivers and car owners who drive themselves must have their eyesight and hearing tested to determine whether they are suitable for driving.</p>

<p>Private Torture Leads to Serious Injury and Death</p>
<p>How Can Public Officials Do Such a Thing?</p>
<p>Zhang Chaosheng, a 37-year-old resident of Jie Gou Township near Yangjia Town in Pudong, relied on farming and fishing for a living. His wife, Zhu, gave birth to a daughter who is now 13 years old. On the night of August 6, Fan Hongsheng and Fan Quansheng invited Zhang to fish in the south bank of the Weijia Sacred Church in the east of the town. Zhang and his friend Ke Miaofa happily agreed to go. At two or three o'clock in the morning, the Fans finished fishing and left first. Zhang and Ke were still reluctant to leave. Not long after, Chen Atu, the owner of the fish pond, gathered a crowd and rushed over, tied up Zhang and Ke with ropes, and sent them to the Xinmin Township Office in the town. Yang Tingdong, the head of the township, learned the situation and ordered Zhang and Ke to be hanged on the two sycamore trees in front of the township office and beaten severely to make an example for those who stole fish. It was not until 7 a.m. that they were persuaded by others to let them down. Zhang suffered more serious injuries and was bedridden after returning home. On August 19, his wife, Zhu, saw that her husband's injuries were getting worse and his life was in danger, so she hired someone to carry Zhang to the township office to cry and make a scene. Yang, the head of the township, had no choice but to give Zhu five yuan in silver and five dou of white rice, persuading her to carry her husband home for treatment. At 1 p.m. on the 23rd, Zhang died of his injuries. Zhang's wife then went to Yang's house and cried on the ground, claiming that he should return her husband's life. Yang had no choice but to go to the Seventh District Office of Nanhui County with Zhang's wife on the 25th to discuss the funeral arrangements. Yang was willing to pay 50 yuan for coffin and funeral expenses. Zhang's wife said that after her husband's death, his wife and daughter were left behind and their livelihood was cut off. Yang should pay the mother and daughter some living expenses. The differences between the two sides were too great to be resolved. The district chief Yu Feng reported it to the Nanhui County Government. The county government appointed clerk Wang Zhongqiu and bailiff Sheng Yi to go to the countryside to inspect the body. After the inspection, they wrote an edict: "Now, Zhang Chaosheng of Jie Gou Township, 37 years old, has a fatal wound on his left rib. It is indeed that he was injured and died before his death. The body has been delayed for many days and the whole body has rotted. The wife is ordered to collect the body as soon as possible for verification." For the sake of caution, Zhang's wife entrusted Shanghai doctor Wang Jianrong to re-examine the body, and the results were as follows: (omitted above) The front end of the left rib is broken at the junction with the costal cartilage. The surrounding area is now grayish-white, and its boundary is about 2.5 inches wide and 3 inches long. It is not rotten, and there are more than a dozen small cyan dots in between. It is indeed that he was injured and died before his death. (omitted below) Since the case occurred, it has been a sensation in the surrounding villages for several days. By the time of the autopsy, the number of onlookers reached hundreds. Zhang's wife has already filed a complaint with the Nanhui County Government, accusing the township head Yang Tingdong of being a public official who privately tortured innocent people, resulting in injury and death, and requesting that he be severely punished.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Tragic Abortion <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Fetus is Gone but the Person Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Yuan, a 33-year-old woman from Yangzhou who lives at No. 1211 Wuzhou Road, had an affair with a man named Da Yanzi, a fellow villager, and became pregnant. She was about several months pregnant, and her abdomen was swollen. Feeling that it was inappropriate, she entrusted Jiangbei woman Gao Dai to introduce her to Wang Chen, a woman from the same hometown who lived at No. 69 Xinjiang Road in Zhabei Huajie, to have an abortion at about 6 p.m. on the 18th of last month. The method of abortion was to insert a medicinal herb into the lower part. After several hours, Yuan was in extreme pain and fainted, losing consciousness. Gao Dai and Wang Chen used massage to move around Yuan's abdomen. Although the fetus was gone, Yuan suffered severe injuries. She was taken to Tongren Hospital by ambulance for treatment. She died on the evening of the day before yesterday. The body was sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road for examination. Later, the Harbin Police learned of this and ordered Detective Ruan Taibin to arrest Gao Dai and Wang Chen one after another and bring them to the police station. The police chief ordered them to be temporarily detained in the women's prison. This morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the case and said that the deceased only had a foster daughter, Zuo Dizi, 11 years old, and two landlords who lived with her. Then Qu Changfu testified that the deceased moved in last August and did not know her background, but the reason for her death was abortion. Then the girl Zuo Dizi said that the deceased called her mother. At that time, she saw the defendants rubbing her mother's abdomen vigorously with their hands. She did not know the rest. Gao Dai confessed that she was entrusted by the deceased to introduce her, and that the price was three yuan, which Wang Chen got. The rest of the confession was evasive. Wang Chen confessed that she had performed an abortion on Yuan and said that the abortion herb, named Lidan Herb, was bought from a certain drugstore. Yuan did not die on the spot, so she asked for a judgment. Judge Xiao Xiechou verified the confession and ordered the two to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Verdict in the Sino-Foreign Pharmacy Case <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Qiao Zixing Sentenced to Four Years</p>
<p>And Fined 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Pharmacy at No. 69 Guangdong Road was found to be selling morphine and other drugs. The Drug Enforcement Department's detective Song Bingzheng, Bao Tan Zhang Shaoqing, etc., found and confiscated drugs worth 50,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e172">Shareholders of China Bank Sue for Illegal Election Fraud <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Plaintiff's Claim is Rejected</p>
<p>The shareholders of the China Commercial Savings Bank, Xu Yasheng, Yuan Jieqing, Wang Meizhen, Chen Anlai, etc., previously hired lawyers to sue the chairman of the bank, Guo Zhuqiao, for illegal election fraud in the Civil Court of the First Special Court. The entire board of directors of the bank, Wang Yiting, Gu Xinyi, Zhu Zikui, Zhu Ziqian, Yao Dexin, etc., believed that the plaintiff's accusations involved the board of directors, so they also hired lawyers Li Jinfu and Xu Zuyan to apply for joint participation. After Judge Shouyi's repeated interrogations, the main text of the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim, and the litigation costs were borne by the plaintiff. The reason for the judgment was that the reason for the plaintiff's claim was whether it was reasonable or not, and whether they had the qualifications of the parties was a prerequisite issue. The total shares of China Bank are 12,500 shares, and the plaintiffs have 62 shares. This is an undisputed fact between the two parties. The dispute is whether the plaintiffs have the right to sue and whether the election by the defendants should be revoked. According to the plaintiffs' lawsuit, it is based on Article 150 of the Company Law, but the Judicial Yuan has interpreted that the so-called violations of laws and regulations only refer to the convening procedures and resolution methods. If the shareholder meeting election is fraudulent, it is not subject to the restrictions of the period of the article. Therefore, its interpretation of election fraud is not subject to the restrictions of the period of Article 150 of the Company Law, because the election fraud is different from the circumstances of the convening and resolution of the shareholder meeting violating laws and regulations, so it does not have to be restricted by the period of the article. It cannot be said that its interpretation only solves the point of the period. The plaintiffs' lawsuit against the defendant's election fraud cannot be based on the article. Article 164 of the Company Law also states that when the shareholder meeting resolves to accuse the directors or even rejects the accusation, and shareholders with more than one-tenth of the total shares apply to the supervisors, the company shall file the accusation within one month from the date of the resolution or application. Therefore, those who can file an accusation against the directors according to the article are limited to the company, and the company must also file the accusation after the shareholder meeting has resolved or shareholders with more than one-tenth of the total shares have applied to the supervisors. Now, the plaintiffs only have 62 shares and have filed a lawsuit directly with the court, which is also inconsistent with the article. The defendant's defense that they have no qualification to sue as parties has to be considered reasonable. Therefore, whether the defendant's election is illegal is not necessary to investigate. According to the above discussion, the plaintiff's claim in this case is unreasonable, and according to Article 97 of the Civil Procedure Law, a judgment is made as in the main text.</p>

<p>Around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, dozens of small workers suddenly gathered at the Xin Sanjing Wharf near the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. A conflict arose over wage distribution, and they wielded iron bars and fought each other. When Section Chief Shen of the Third District Police Station of Qichang Warehouse learned of the incident, he led the police to the scene to stop it. Two people had already been injured: Feng Degui, a 26-year-old from Gaoyou, suffered a head injury with blood flowing, and Sun Ganquan, a 26-year-old from Taizhou, had his leg injured by an iron bar. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the crowd scattered like frightened birds. They apprehended a suspect named Qian Degui and found three iron bars on the way. Together with the injured, they were taken to the station and then transferred to the Third District that evening. According to Feng and Sun's joint statement, they were coal-carrying workers at the Xin Sanjing Wharf. After finishing work that afternoon, the foreman gave them 120,000 copper coins for wage distribution to the workers. Unexpectedly, Qian Ganquan led dozens of people to provoke and beat them, and all the copper coins were stolen. Qian Degui, 36 years old from Taizhou, residing at No. 8 Wujia Hearing, stated that he was a small worker and that the perpetrators had already fled and were unknown to him. The District Chief, considering the case a criminal matter, ordered the original plaintiff and defendant to be escorted to the court for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Pudong Electric Company Collecting Additional Share Payments <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Collection Starts Today via the Shanghai Bank</p>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company has been actively engaged in construction recently, sparing no effort. In May, it extended its lines to Zhangjialou, and in June, it expanded eastward to Jinjiaxiang. Starting from Zhoujiadu, it has set up feeder lines along the newly built Pudong Trunk Road of the Municipal Government, extending north to near Yangjing Port. According to the original plan, it needs to be further extended to Donggou, which should be completed in approximately November. The entire line is 20 kilometers long and can transmit 2,000 kilowatts of electricity. In other areas, new poles and lines are being installed for new users. The capacity of transformers has also increased significantly. After the completion of the Pudong Trunk Road mainline, it plans to expand from Donggou to Gaoxing Town and from Yangsi to Sanlin Town. There is also Yangjing Road, a vital thoroughfare from Lujiadu to Yangjing Town, where high-voltage lines are planned for connection. The company's total capital was originally set at 500,000 yuan, of which 400,000 yuan has already been collected, leaving 100,000 yuan uncollected. Now, due to vigorous construction and high demand for funds, the Board of Directors has decided to collect the remaining 100,000 yuan in full within two months, from September 1st to October 31st.

<p>Japanese Spread Rumors and Anti-Chinese Sentiment Intensifies</p>
<p>Nearly Half of Overseas Chinese Are Returning Home</p>
<p>Zhang Weicheng, the consul stationed in Korea, sent a letter to Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, reporting on the Xian incident and the receipt of funds to aid overseas Chinese, saying, "In Shanghai, I had the pleasure of conversing with you. After our farewell, I returned to my post at the end of June. On July 3rd, there were anti-Chinese news reports, and I immediately warned the Governor-General of Korea and requested serious precautions and effective protection. On one hand, I sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the embassy in Japan (because the Governor-General and the Supervisor-General were both in Tokyo), and on the other hand, I informed all consulates in Korea. The riots there were not yet severe. From the 3rd to the 9th, I went to the Korean Governor-General's office for serious negotiations. The consulate accommodated 4,000 refugees, not including the branch consulates. My colleagues worked through the night, still worrying about the backlog. The busyness of the affairs can be imagined. Unexpectedly, riots broke out in various places, and overseas Chinese suffered greatly. The Chinese merchants in Pyongyang were almost completely wiped out and have not yet recovered. The aftermath is extremely complicated. Although the Japanese side has apologized and various places have gradually calmed down, the resentment remains deep, and the overseas Chinese are anxious. Recently, Japanese newspapers issued special editions for the Qingdao National Essence Society incident, falsely claiming that sixty Japanese were killed and twenty were injured, causing anti-Chinese sentiment to intensify again. Our consulate received warning letters from Japanese people attacking the consulate and forming suicide squads. Nearly half of the overseas Chinese are returning home. I have been ill for a month, spending my days with a medicine stove, but with many affairs and few people, I have to work hard despite my illness. It has been almost two months since the riots, and my colleagues work as usual every week without rest. In addition, there are many overseas Chinese groups with different opinions. Inwardly and outwardly, the pain is difficult to express. Knowing that you are concerned, I am only briefly reporting. I recently heard that your Municipal Chamber of Commerce has remitted nearly 7,000 yuan to the Capital Chamber of Commerce, for which I am especially grateful. I hope you will inform the donating organizations. In addition, the Korean Chinese Chambers of Commerce include more than ten locations such as Gyeongseong, Incheon, Pyongyang, Jinnampo, Busan, Sinuiju, Wonsan, Chongjin, Daegu, Unsan, Bukchin, Hamheung, and Ungcheon Seongjin, each with its own area, and there is no organization for joint meetings. There are even more chambers of commerce and public associations in small places in the outer provinces. Because overseas Chinese used to live together with Japanese and Koreans, even in remote villages there are several or dozens of Chinese families. The situation is different from elsewhere, and the affairs of the consulate are also more difficult to handle. Please pay attention."</p>

After the company sent personnel to He County to investigate and negotiate, both parties reached an agreement and signed a contract. The company has already purchased and transported machinery from famous British and American factories to the port for transfer to He County for use, and has begun advertising to recruit mining workers.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Textile Annual (Continued) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Yuan</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu also has an article, "An Investigative Record of the Japanese Textile Industry," which is an even more valuable piece of writing. The investigation took more than a month of time, and the places visited included Japan's six major cities: Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Kobe, Kyoto, and Nagasaki. According to Mr. Zhu's report, a certain textile factory in Tokyo has 120,000 spindles and 1,700 looms, producing yarn ranging from 30 counts to 120 counts, using American cotton, Sea Island cotton, and Egyptian cotton as raw materials. The factory has a total of 2,200 female workers and 500 male workers. The female workers are all young women aged 16 to 20. Board and lodging are provided by the factory, with a deduction of only 12 cents per person per day for meals. Eighteen people live in each room, and each room has a low table with books and vases for the female workers to read and use. There is a well-equipped library for female workers and two complete hospitals. Each patient has a scroll in hand. It is learned that all female workers must study for at least six years before entering the factory, so there are no illiterate workers in the factory. The factory also has classrooms and recreational facilities, and all the necessary equipment for daily life is complete. After reading the above passage, let us compare it with our country's factories. How different are they? Mr. Zhu also visited the Textile Department of Tokyo Institute of Technology, the Industrial Experiment Institute, the Umeda Steel Works, the Toyota Automatic Loom Company, the Kikuichi Textile Company, the Kishiwada Textile Company, the Uchiumi Textile Company, and other major factories, examining in detail the equipment, working conditions, types of machinery, engineering sequence, and production ratios. He also listed 30 superior points of Japanese factories for us to adopt.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Panyuan's "Horsepower of Textile Machines" compares and clarifies the horsepower of cotton openers, roving frames, coarse yarn frames, and fine yarn frames, so that those who aspire to this industry have something to choose from.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Xianfang's "Overview of the Establishment and Reorganization of the Shenxin Textile Factory No. 7" describes the factory's history, the obstacles at the beginning, and the overview of the reorganization in an orderly manner. Although the equipment inside is not even one-tenth of that of Japanese factories, the planned design and step-by-step implementation will make it easy to gradually improve. Therefore, this article is of great practical reference value.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Shouyi's "Installation Method of Platt Spinning Machines" explains the matters to be noted when receiving machine boxes, the matters to be noted when unpacking and cleaning machine parts, and the sequence and precautions for installing each machine, one by one. Only those who are familiar with specialized academic knowledge can write a single word.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen also has an article, "Belt Knowledge," which explains in detail the quality, use, design of belts with numbers and drawings. The mechanical algorithm and maintenance method of belts are also answered in depth and clearly based on scientific principles.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Zhulan's "Research on Belts" First, the raw materials used for belts are described, the second section describes the belt speed, the third section describes belt transmission, the fourth section describes belt strength, the fifth section describes the horsepower required for belts, the sixth section describes belt transmission methods, the seventh section describes the length of belts, the eighth section describes belt joint methods, the ninth section describes belt protection, the tenth section describes belt selection, and the eleventh section describes belt calculation principles. Each section uses geometric formulas to explain, which is tens of thousands of words and the essence of scientific writing.</p>
<p>Mr. Mu Yidao's "Research on Lighting in Textile Factories" and "Research on Adjusting Humidity and Moisture in Textile Factories" are both practical studies on the equipment of textile factories, mostly from experience. However, his discussion of lighting is also in line with science and is suitable for the hygiene of workers. The research on air is translated from the original work of Tan Baisun in the United States, and the translation is fluent and readable.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Yunkui's "Design of Cloth Factories" includes the description of machines, the allocation of the number of machines, the construction of factories, the arrangement of machines, the adjustment of temperature and humidity, and the installation of electric lights, and all the designs that cloth factories should have are complete with an attached diagram, which is even clearer.</p>
<p>In the investigation column, Mr. Ye Liang's "A Glimpse of Imported Textiles" statistically shows the import quantities of cotton yarn, wool yarn, rayon, cotton cloth, woolen fabrics, silk fabrics, and other groceries over the years, which is enough to alert people.</p>

<p>Hearing people say that the weather is hot, I raised my head and looked at the ceiling, and many useless things came to my mind, like I wanted to cry. I feel that those who have time to say it is hot are ultimately happy.</p>
<p>I remember there was a time when I couldn't settle for my quiet life and said I wanted to move, saying that young people are bravely demanding stimulation after extreme depression, so like a dream, I ran from Beiping to Nanjing to become a soldier.</p>
<p>Everyone was young, with fiery enthusiasm. The aspiration in front of us was revolution. The team made you dare not relax your caution from morning to night. Everyone's work was tense. Hearing the cicadas chirping in the trees, I didn't care that summer had already come. What I held in my hand was a Type 79 rifle. On the drill field, no one paid attention to the sun.</p>
<p>Now the environment has brought me to another world. Although I feel the pain of poverty more acutely because of illness, I have the right to sit here and write articles very peacefully. I write from morning to night, writing what to get published there. I don't even have the courage to answer myself. It seems that I understand that since society doesn't need me, I can't despise fulfilling this boring obligation.</p>
<p>Do they say I am a person who studies literature? I am sad. For the sake of creation, I say, try all kinds of lives. So I was like a frightened sheep, running around aimlessly. Where is the battlefield of life? When news of the war came, whether it was a victory or a defeat, I was not happy or sad. This tree, six years have passed. Looking at my thin and weak physique, touching the scars on each part, I escaped, a defeated soldier.</p>
<p>But I should still celebrate that I was lucky enough not to die. If I died, then the opportunity for others to laugh at my stupid behavior would also be lost. Those people, they say,</p>
<p>(What is life? Take a look. We are everyone's standard.)</p>
<p>What kind of standard is it? What I know is that they told me,</p>
<p>Friends, these days are too pitiful. People are so poor. Can we, knowledgeable young people, not help them get rid of it? On the one hand, we must demonstrate against the oppressors. Our responsibility is to let the forces that destroy those people be destroyed.</p>
<p>I dare not say whether this is right or wrong. But they say I am outdated. After a few days, they caught me again and said,</p>
<p>(No wonder ×× said there was no way. It's true. No one in society understands our actions. Is our time and energy only to get this bit of ridicule in return?)</p>
<p>Not long after these words were spoken, I met them again in the park. The time was autumn, and the wind brought a desolate feeling. The shaking shadows, I clearly knew that they were feeling confused inside.</p>
<p>(, Lao Wang, long time no see. Do you often come to the park to play?)</p>
<p>(I don't come often, because I feel that time is too tight.)</p>
<p>(Ah, you are really brave, someone who can say that time is too tight must have a lot of work. We always have to come here to relax every day.)</p>
<p>I could only smile at them. There were no appropriate words that I could use to answer that fit the current situation.</p>
<p>(But is there really no way out for us? The world is so big.)</p>
<p>(Living like this is really dangerous.)</p>
<p>(……)</p>
<p>They said several more words. I knew that if I didn't sympathize with them, they would easily laugh at me for not having suffered any setbacks.</p>
<p>Autumn died, and spring had already come to the world, but I never saw these people again. I knew that some people would commit suicide when they were frustrated, so I was a little worried about them. I searched for their news everywhere, but I received their replies like this,</p>
<p>(Friends, I'm really sorry, I ran to this very remote foreign land, and I feel it is disrespectful to write to friends in a hurry. Moreover, the life of the army makes my shadow as small as a free-floating firefly. Forgive me for not being able to write a long letter when I am too busy to shout to kill the enemy.)</p>
<p>Another person's letter</p>
<p>(...I heard that ×× is a quartermaster in the ×× army, and because he ate too much privately, he was dismissed. Did you know? It is said that dismissal is still considered a fluke... )</p>
<p>Some of them became teachers. Hearing others say that this friend's current argument is,</p>
<p>(Only by starting with education is there a good way out for young people. China is currently lacking leadership talents, and being a teacher is the first step in leadership work.)</p>
<p>After hearing these words, it seemed that I had forgotten the trend of this friend instigating the replacement of teachers in schools a year ago, as well as what he said at that time that education was like a blind man riding a blind horse.</p>
<p>Two months ago, ××, who told me that he would vow to remain single, took his lover to Open air for swimming that day. I said,</p>
<p>(×× Women are poisonous snakes, you said.)</p>
<p>×× didn't reply at the time, but a few days later, someone told me that ×× was dissatisfied with what I said to him in the swimming pool, saying that I had intentionally insulted him, and also cursed me for being corrupt and despising women's rights.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I have been ridiculed everywhere for a long time, just like today. But can I worry about these things? Young people are all moving forward and developing in this way, but I am still sitting here, doing something close to foolish writing. What use am I?</p>
<p>I didn't tell anyone that my mother has been starving for a long time thousands of miles away. In the crowds on Fourth Horse Road, I found that every prostitute might be like my homeless sister. I am walking to the end of my youth. Can I say that I have been separated from happiness for a long time? ...</p>
<p>I feel that thinking about my own affairs is a luxury.</p>
<p>Hot? I will honestly do my duty with the will of the times. I want to write, and I have my actions before and after writing.</p>

<p>(2) Books are limited to those about youth issues.</p>
<p>(3) Photos that qualify are those of youth life (such as sports, travel, excursions, theatrical performances, lectures, gatherings, exhibitions, various competitions, etc.), school news, and youth movements. Whether individual or group, both are welcome. Do not write on both sides of the manuscript paper.</p>
