<p>陸氏家庭無限曲折</p>
<p>陸仲恩係誰家子</p>
<p>牧師與女佈道戀愛住居新垃圾橋華通坊四號之浙江定海人陸子新丶年已𠘡十有六丶壯歲被耶敎監理公會委充東新塲鎭分會之牧師時丶與女佈道華沈氏發生戀愛丶</p>
<p>私生一子絕對秘密旋生一子丶取名陸仲恩丶該氏之夫華傑不知也丶陸俟仲恩稍長丶即爲出資讀書丶惟敎會規律綦嚴丶此種非正式之結合丶素所不容丶故陸等之戀愛丶初則絕對秘密丶及生子後丶外間人言嘖嘖丶然彼等仍諱莫如深丶</p>
<p>劇病求醫送還其子仲恩九歲丶沈氏患病甚劇丶求治於某醫院丶經醫生診察丶以須剖腹治療丶或可勿藥丶該氏深慮施用手術丶極其危險丶萬一治而不效丶則所生之子丶必失依恃丶倘諱疾忌醫丶又遺終身痛苦丶思維之下丶乃將子交給子莊丶毅然投身醫院丶</p>
<p>敎會革職復棄於夫子莊恐與職業有礙丶不敢公然撫養丶適其族弟楝生抱喪明之痛丶爰將此子贈之丶俾免牽累丶厥後陸與沈氏之曖昩行爲丶終被監理會主腦覺察丶以有背敎規丶斥沈氏職丶而其夫華傑生丶因彼不守婦道丶亦棄之如屣丶幸子莊尙念舊誼丶每月給以六元丶以資度日丶</p>
<p>年老色衰困苦殊甚迨仲恩十四五歲時丶沈氏乃往厦門路衍慶里二百二十七號棟生家丶與子謀面丶即經棟生告如仲恩丶謂此爲汝之生母丶並述往事丶仲恩聞後淡然丶沈氏遂去丶最近子莊之牧師職務停止丶按月六金之津貼丶亦不再給丶沈氏年老色袞丶困苦殊甚丶</p>
<p>子不認母大起衝突兩月之前丶又赴棟生家求助於子丶蓋其已知仲恩業早成年丶今爲二十三歲丶服務於工部局丶月得優越薪金丶故往望子贍養丶不意仲恩因其繼父棟生云丶如認母則應隨母去之言丶遂否認沈氏爲彼之生母丶當時大起衝突丶</p>
<p>母控子一度被駁斥事後沈氏特投特區地方法院丶以刑事起訴陸仲恩傷害尊親丶不顧贍養等情丶經特院傳審之下丶以原告起訴程序丶不盡合法丶將案駁斥不理丶</p>

<p>父子叔侄身份之訴現仲恩窺悉內容丶亦延律師陸起丶對子莊·棟生·及陳陸廉箴提起控訴丶請求確定渠之身分丶對子莊爲父子丶對棟生爲叔侄丶並請判令陳陸氏勿得干預渠家務等情丶</p>
<p>冒認親子希圖遺產子莊父女丶則延奚士昌律師辯訴丶指仲恩冒認親子丶希圖遺產丶謂仲恩實係華傑生與華沈氏所生丶惟其父母窮極無歸丶始皈依耶敎丶其四歲時丶由華傑生送至蘇州慕家花園監理公會所設之幼稚園肄業丶初名華約翰丶九歲時丶其父母無力扶養丶始送與陸棟生丶作爲養子丶深得棟生夫婦寵愛丶竟益傲慢丶其義母趙氏丶前年竟被踢傷身死丶時其義父棟生丶本欲送院究辦丶因其表示悔改丶以故中止丶上月間丶被生母控告不顧贍養丶着令歸家丶乃異想天開丶揑稱係子莊所生丶而兼祧雙房云云丶殊屬可笑丶圖得陸氏家產丶不問可知丶請求駁斥其訴丶</p>

<p>錫麐１○５付之一笑·海·客　　校長（接到了一個電話。向電話簡中說。）丨𣋘。你是甚麼人。　　打電話者丨你是甚麼人。　　校長(聽那聲音。知道是他的十歲的愛子。因與相戲。）丨你問我是誰麼。我是一個天下第一等的好人。　　打電話者丨對不起。號碼弄錯了。妻丨我近來唱歌很有進步。你要聽我唱一曲麼。　　夫丨好的。你且唱一曲我聽聽。　　妻丨我的嗓子很好。（放聲高唱起來）　　夫丨且慢且慢。（急將窗門關閉）　　妻（停了唱）丨你爲甚麼將窗門都關閉了夫丨我怕鄰家聽了誤會。還道我在這裏痛打你哩。　　父（將一小說給伊的兒子）丨孩子。你在課餘可以讀這本書。因爲這是一部極好的小說。　　子丨咦。父親。這部書我早已在學校圖書室中讀過了。　　父丨你讀了之後。以爲如何。你能下一斷語麼。　　子丨那結局太悽慘了。我不喜歡。　　父丨這書的結局明明是圓滿的。怎說是悽慘。　　子丨你不見那書中的主人公拋下了戀人。回到家裏去就他的妻子。這不是太悽慘麼。馮蒿叟之與凍荳腐  鄭逸梅　　獻歲以來。氣候凜兢。檐際冰筯。垂埀盈尺。家人購凍豆腐。和豚兒肉煑之。用以佐酒。別饒風味。客有與故詞人馮蒿叟有舊者。因謂蒿叟嗜啖凍豆腐。飲酒銷寒。匪凍豆腐不可。曾吟有凍豆腐長歌一首。惜散佚不復存稿。否則大可與隨園老人彘首一記同傳誦也。薰風扇夏。噉李剖瓜之餘。更必以凍豆腐薦羞。但天暑。豆腐無從而凍。則於隆冬預爲儲之。法取凍豆腐。曝諸於日。待其凍解爲水。水乾。豆腐堅硬似鐵。然後甕以藏之。加封務求其密。則可久儲不壞。夏日。發甕煑爲饌。爽美無與倫比。蒿臾啖之。津津有味。爲之健飯。蒿叟善書。曾云。臨池有六宜。宜夏晨清風。宜冬午暖日。宜品茗餘。宜薄醉後。宜慧婢捧硯。宜明僮焚香。非雋人不能作此雋語。蒿叟頗喜詼諧。嘗與客長談。時歲暮天寒。晚來欲雪。蒿叟留客夜飲。酒酣。蒿叟曰。古人所謂歲寒三友。非松竹梅乎。然則我興三友有夙契矣。客詢之。則日。今以松菌豆腐。佐竹葉清酒。而君署梅谿。是亦三友也。客爲之莞爾。傾觴者再。不知門外積雪。深深已沒馬蹏。萬叟。金壇人。字夢華。曩爲滬上寓公者有年。蓋遺老之一云。風凄月冷三芳塋  馬協衷　　上海公墓爲滬濱四大公驀之一。在江灣跑馬廳之東。地屬殷行鄉。由江灣鎭前往。爲程約七八里之遙。墓基佔地約二百畝。係鎭海某鉅商所創辦。落成於民十七年冬。此地人聲沉寂。車爲鮮至。若值日麗風和。舉目縱眺。尙覺胸懷豁朗。至若陰雨連綿時。則徜徉其間。未免有悲從中來之感。公墓內新塋纍纍。碑碣如林。皆屬經營未久者。其西偏一角。有國府監察院長于右任氏之女公子淑賢墓。稍北則有江蘇民政廳長胡樸安之女公子湋平驀。二女士生前。曾一度同學於海上城東女校。于女士擅書法。深得翼如夫婦遊焦山歸各　　以長楓見示賦答胡展堂　　二光隱處招梁孟。遲我同遊悵未行。再宿松寥宜舊識。一拈梅萼有新聲。江山自如爲君助。風雨何曾敗敗月明。訪戴山陰如此趣。故留佳話傲雙清。　　家學淵源。胡女士則兼長書畫。書法趙撝叔。畫則臨摹黃石谷。自于女士隨乃父返陝後。二人遂相隔別。從茲天涯海角。相望增思。但人事靡常。朝菌易萎。故曾不數年。二女士均相繼殂謝。殊爲可哀。今二女士合一墓地。芳塋爲隣。未始非偶然之事。九原有知。其情誼當更勝於生日。而風雨晨昏。覊魂有伴。度不致苦寂歟。　又該公墓內。另有一塋。碣王鐫爲﹁愛女娜娜婷婷之墓﹂。其取名殊奇麗。不知誰家之掌上雙珠。留得一坏黃士在此。憑弔之餘。更令人悲從中來也。程在豓秋之祈禱和平謹愼　　程艷秋新編荒山淚一劇。亦名祈禱和平。現已脫稿。茲錄其說明書如下。此劇取材於明代故事。叙說濟源縣有獵戶高良敏者。妻陳氏。子名忠。媳張慧珠。孫寶璉。一門五口。雖境遇貧寒。而家庭雍穆。具有天倫之樂。因楊嗣昌以兵費不足。主徵勦餉練餉。復奏加賦。其時差役橫行。百姓愁怨。高良敏父子困於納稅。奮身採獵。均喪虎口。其孫寳璉。復爲官軍捉去。充當兵役。陳氏痛憤。嘔血身死。所僅存者。只此伶仃孤苦之張慧珠一人而已。情節固甚簡單。而穿揷頗費心匠。程藝員艶秋飾張慧珠。初將勤織所得。僅供賦稅。繼則迭遭家變。一身支拄。終爲惡役所逼。窮窘無路。自慨躬遭喪亂。兵連禍結。旣痛身世。復憫斯民。於是竄身荒谷。哀籲呼天。掬悲憫之深清。作和平之祈禱。不惜一死爲民請命。此全劇結品之所在也。其中月夜待夫一塲。唱南梆子。驚疑憂懼。愈逼愈緊。空中見夫一塲。唱快板。憤懣狂易。如醉如痴。稱種情熊。傳神維肖。末塲純用搖板。以獨造之腔調。作凄𣆳之哀呼。地老天荒。血枯淚盡。觀者至此。未有不迴腸盪氣。酒同情之淚。以呼籲和平也。至其描寫之深刻。神情之悲壯。則程君素擅悲劇。別有會心。顧曲諸公。夙有定論。無取詞費也。掌頰愈病記醉痴生　友人舒鴨子。近自甬中來。謂該處曾發生二掌頰愈病之趣聞。余以其事詭奇。且足以諷世也。爰泚筆記之。有某生。年弱冠而未娶。顧影翩翩。風流自賞。附近有某姓婦。固文君新寡者。生偶過其居。見婦斜倚門前。縞服素面。驚爲天人。乃眉挑目逗。久之竟諧好事。並叮嚀而別。詎婦事後。旣感白璧之有玷。清夜自思。愧悔交併。自是深閨靜守。不作出墻之紅杏。而生自別婦後。花晨月夕。恒書空咄咄。室邇人遙。又不敢造次存問。朝夕遐想。形神日以憔悴。懨懨成病。家人憂之。爲延醫服藥。亦如水投石。厥疾難瘳。一日。生又訪婦居。適婦立門外。如有所矚。生喜不自勝。鞠躬而前。方欲軟語溫存。婦突以掌掌生頰。怒斥曰。咄爾狂生。敗人名節。乃猶不知唆改。妄想吃天鵝肉耶。今施薄懲。聊絕汝念。言已。闔扉遽入。生被此纖掌之一擊。恍如服一劑清凉散。慾火頓消。悵悵而歸。生受此意外之敎訓。遂痛改前非。不敢再作非分想。而病亦霍然若失云。　　醉痴生曰。按婦之一掌。如當頭棒。眞是快人快事。其寥寥數言。更是快人快語。而能懸崖勒馬。勇於悔過。尤爲難能可貴。然世之竊玉偷香者多矣。安得以美人掌。一一而痛擊之哉。日本浴談履冰　　客自東瀛來者。盛道該邦人民之清潔。謂勞工雜集。雖盛暑中亦無些微惡臭。觸人使厭。斯實爲各國所難能。蓋其社會中無論上下。均注重浴身。肥皂與水。乃個人生活日常所不可缺者也。　　日本各地多公共浴塲。佈置極簡。祗在地面埋設浴缸。其旁則多置木桶。入浴之前。每先以桶取水。用皂汁遍洗。俟垢汚已去。始移身缸中。男女同浴。彼邦例所不禁。巨大之浴所中。男女長幼。同時並浴。率於其間橫一竹竿。以作隔絕性別之標記。　　日人不祗潔身。劉於衣服之洗濯。亦特加注意。人力車夫奔走長途。俟得稍息。即往公共浴塲。潔身之後。常將汚衣自洗。以待其乾。如時間不及。彼恒自車墊下另取一服。從事更換。故驅車歸來時。其衣服之整潔。一如晨間出門時也。我國近年頗提倡清潔運動。則日人好潔之習慣似爲邦人所應取法者也。因誌之。巴黎物語六曾寄於巴黎　　其次郵船遇着了冰山。船底受損。海水不斷的浸入。船員努力使乘客鎭靜。但終無效。船長發令放救生艇。先救婦人和小孩。乘客瘋狂似的騷擾。　　當外面甲板上正在昏天黑地的閙着時。吃烟室內展天了一幕悲劇。船副跑來通知學者。因爲他是病人。他可以和他的女人及媳婦等同下救生艇。但他的兒子應當留着。一家人紛擾起來。懐中有孕的媳婦不允捨去伊的丈夫。父親提議犧牲自己來讓兒子逃走。母親又爭着要替代丈夫。但船副聲明這一切爭擾全無用處。因船中職員已受有命令槍斃一切與婦人爭下救生艇之男子。　　甲板上的大紛擾繼續不已。船長令船中樂隊在船尾奏樂安慰乘客。當吃烟室的悲劇尙未了結時。另外一齣悲劇又展開在船上的一間小房內。實業家郎柏在他女人的姦夫房內破獲了姦情他連自已一起把三人反鎖在房內。把鎖鑰從窗洞拋入海中。然後通知姦夫姦婦船已遇難了。兩個可憐蟲同時發出一片絕望的呌喊。　　吃烟室的悲劇再又展開。本來患着心臟病的兒子忽然暈過去了。於是船副呌人將他抬下小艇和他的女人一同逃去。父親和母親留着。膽怯的歌人渾身戰慄着哭着。嗜酒的命運論者很勇敢而又很安靜的繼續飲酒。船漂流着快近沉沒了。　　這時沒有小艇可以逃生的三等客人同聲發出一片悲壯的讚美歌聲。他們離地愈遠離上帝愈近了。小艇紛紛消逝了。巨大的郵船挾着許多絕望的人們漸漸的被洪濤隱滅了。　　據我的意思。這影片內會話揷得太多了。對於海·冰山·救生動作及船的沉沒等景照得太少。但大體說來。演員的分配還很恰當。有幾幕頗能使人留下一個强烈的印象。這影片雖不能算是傑作。但還有一看的價値。心上溫馨（）三五三）包天笑　　第十七回駐顏有術翠黛溷蛾眉續命無方黃金市駿骨老林黛玉一面心中這們想。。便也走到了任佩眞的身後。。綠漪房間裏的人。連忙移過一張椅子來。。一時檯面上的堂唱。。有幾個認得伊的。。都喚着伊大伯伯。。有的道。大伯伯。。怎麼不到我們那邊来。。有的道。。大伯伯。我們姆媽在牽記你。。原來伊是上海花國的元老。。所以那一輩子後生小子。。都要向伊周旋問候。。伊也不敢擺出老輩的架子。。知道那班後生可畏。。他們正在出鋒頭的時候。。自己已是落伍人物了。。也照例的和他們敷衍幾句。。向他們或是說道。阿囡你益發生得標緻了。或是說道。。問問你姆媽的好。說我記牽俚。。敷衍完了。連忙來和任佩眞周旋。。說是剛纔有張局票。。也是一位姓任的。。孫企雷連忙接口道。。就是那位任先生呌的。。等了你好半天。。方纔到此地來的。。老林黛玉道。。阿呀。。眞正對弗住極哉。實在是因爲今天有點頭裏痛。。起來得遲了一點。。堂唱就脫去了不少。。有許多地方。。代堂唱還不中用。一定要我自家去的。承蒙各位老爺們。。······說到那裏。向任佩眞望了一望。。又接着說道。。太太們。。先生們的檯舉。我就非自己去不可了。。在座們賓客中。。有兩位沒有見過老林黛玉的。。。聽說伊已經是四十多歲。。將近半百的人了。。但看伊還是豐容盛鬋。。體態風流。。臉暈霞紅。。眉描山翠。。尤其是烏黑的頭髮。。打了那種時式的前劉海。。深深地覆在額角上。。伊本來是一種豐滿的面龐。。現在施了穠妝。。燕脂抹得飛紅。。眉毛那時流行了一種劍眉··原來老林黛玉在三四年以前。。還在上海一個女戲院裏。。唱過一陣子戲。。戲台上的化妝。。都是趨重濃艶一路。。伊後來覺得唱不動戲了。。還是重操故業。。棄伶爲倡。。賣賣伊的老面子。。要想掩飾伊的秋娘姿容。。不能不在化妝上加一番工作··可是一打扮了出來。在酒邊燈下。。誰也瞧得出伊是年近半百的人。。還當伊是一位二十三四的大姑娘咧。。老林黛玉坐定以後。。孫企雷便向伊說道。。這位任先生。。很慕你的大名。。所以剛纔在那邊等不及。。到了此地。。又來呌你。。非見一見你不可。。老林黛玉道。。阿呀。。眞正對弗住。。我是一個老太婆哉。。現在總算拉裏免討飯。。請諸位包荒點吧。。說時。身邊掏出一隻圓圓的小金盒子。。裏面拈出了幾粒細碎的豆𦸅。。敬與任佩眞。。敎伊咀嚼。。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chiang's Instruction at the Ministry of Education <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Educators Should Have Central Beliefs</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th - At the Ministry of Education's weekly memorial service, Chiang's address roughly stated that the Ministry of Education is the central hub of national education. All instructions issued will influence the entire country. Without a central belief to determine a concrete plan, all educational facilities will be ineffective. The reason for the lack of progress in Chinese education over the past 19 years is due to the lack of central beliefs among educators. Therefore, now that military affairs have been settled and the country unified, the grand plan for the next century rests on establishing a foundation with education. Colleagues at the Ministry of Education should clearly understand that educators must have central beliefs. The so-called central belief is the Three Principles of the People bequeathed by Sun Yat-sen. The origin of the central thought of Sun Yat-senism is based on our nation's inherent benevolence, righteousness, morality, and ethics. If we understand this and use it to run education, progress will be rapid. Those who call themselves new youth but have actually gone astray, and those in the education sector who fail to recognize the history and environment of the Chinese nation, mostly do not understand the central thought of Sun Yat-senism. If they can all understand this point, they will surely believe in Sun Yat-senism and strive for national construction. All of you serving in the Ministry of Education should first understand this point. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>China's Mineral Industry Is Extremely Rich</p>
<p>Beiping - People from all countries are paying attention to the League of Nations' 100 million pound loan, saying that China's various mineral industries are extremely rich. If 50 million pounds are used exclusively to operate various gold mines, the principal and interest can be repaid within two years, and the society will have an additional 50 million pounds of circulating money. From then on, the wealth and power can be increased by 50 million pounds every two years. It is harmless to borrow money to run industries, but it is absolutely forbidden to borrow money to issue military and political expenses. An American mineral expert said that the gold mines in Sichuan, Tibet, the Northeast, and Xinjiang are enough to employ 500,000 workers. Opening mines with redundant soldiers is closer and faster than guiding the river. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Anniversary of the Founding of the German Federation <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The German people were unusually enthusiastic about celebrating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Federation this time, commemorating Bismarck's achievement, which was also promoted by the difficult situation they were in. Foreign Minister Cotts said in a speech at the German Consulate in Geneva that the development of the German national unity psychology is the most valuable asset of the German people, which should be cherished and cultivated by overseas Chinese all over the world. The国民党 congressman Kahl spoke at the Berlin celebration, advising the people to eliminate all kinds of distractions and help each other to overcome the current difficulties. The most important thing is to have a heart of sacrifice, even if it is absolutely necessary to maintain the country, even sacrificing the claims of ordinary ambitions is worthwhile. His words are the most important. People in the world can sacrifice their lives for the country, sacrifice money for the country, sacrifice political power and everything else for the country, but they are not willing to sacrifice their ideals and claims for the country. The reason why they are unwilling to sacrifice their ideals and claims is that they believe that their ideals and claims are without error. Very few can suddenly realize that they are for the sake of the country, let alone a nation that is strong and persevering, is even harder to change easily. The unity and willingness of the German nation to sacrifice are indeed valuable assets of Germany, but its usual claims are not easy to change and are also characteristics of the German people. Recently, when its people are in such a difficult situation, they still hold their own views on domestic and foreign affairs without any concession, and the competition between parties is becoming increasingly fierce. The Brunning cabinet will eventually find it difficult to maintain, and the political situation is in a state of turmoil and danger, and there is still no room for discussion, which can be used as evidence. The congressman's encouragement to the people is indeed the medicine of the German people.</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary Serves as Acting Chairman</p>
<p>Opium Committee Submits Report</p>
<p>League of Nations is Like a Mousetrap</p>
<p>Once Fallen into, Permanently Restricted</p>
<p>Commentary by the Turkish Nationalist Party Newspaper</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 19th - The 62nd session of the League of Nations Council was held at 11 o'clock this morning, with the opening speech given by British Foreign Secretary Henderson. According to the original plan, it should have been chaired by the German Foreign Secretary. However, the German Foreign Secretary believes that Germany will have a major attack on a certain country at this meeting, so he asked the British Foreign Secretary to serve as acting chairman.</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency, Constantinople, 18th - A Turkish Nationalist Party newspaper commented on the relationship between Turkey and the League of Nations and the European Federation plan, vehemently opposing Turkey joining the League of Nations. It said that the organization is like a mousetrap, allowing small countries to be permanently restricted by powerful countries. If Turkey has a real need, it may not be able to count on the League of Nations for assistance, because it will never dare to offend a major country. The situation when France attacked Turkey in the past can be used as clear proof. Therefore, joining the League of Nations would only subject the revolutionary goals held today to compromising policies.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 19th - The chairman of the League of Nations Opium Committee, the former Shanghai Customs Commissioner Lyall, submitted a report to the League of Nations Administrative Council, which stated: "The publications and propaganda carried out by the League of Nations Opium Office have not significantly reduced the world's opium trade." Lyall also said that the opium trade is still unimpeded. Since the Opium Office has implemented various methods without success, it should now use its power to condemn countries that are about to become centers of illegal trade. The report submitted by the Opium Office to the International Administrative Council expressed deep dissatisfaction with some countries that have been slow to respond to the League of Nations' requests to answer all inquiries, including some that have already signed the Geneva Opium Convention. Some countries only reported the figures for legal imports, and did not mention a word about the confiscation of illegal drugs. Furthermore, some countries mixed the figures for their tropical and European regions together. It is particularly regrettable that almost no responses were received from countries in South America and Central America. The League of Nations Administrative Council has adopted the Opium Office's recommendation to allow the prohibition of opium imports from countries that defy the League of Nations and to report the source of confiscated illegal drugs to the Opium Office.</p>

<p>Speech by Civilian Party Member Kahr</p>
<p>Advising the People to Eliminate Miscellaneous Thoughts and Overcome Current Difficulties Together</p>
<p>Should Have an Optimistic Attitude Towards the Future Development of the Country</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 18th - Today, drums and cannons sounded in Berlin, and flags flew from public and private buildings to celebrate the grand occasion of the establishment of the German Federation in the Palace of Versailles sixty years ago. People in the political arena gathered in the parliament. Around 11 o'clock in the morning, President Hindenburg personally visited the conference hall and held a celebration ceremony. Kahr, a member of the Nationalist Party and a professor at the University of Berlin, gave a speech on the grand occasion of witnessing the establishment of the Federation sixty years ago, advising the people at this time to eliminate all miscellaneous thoughts and only think about the welfare of the motherland and the consolidation of the Federation, helping each other and overcoming the current difficulties together. First, there must be a spirit of sacrifice. If it is absolutely necessary to protect the country, even sacrificing the ideals held in peacetime is not reluctant. For what has been achieved in recent years, such as the regaining of freedom in the Rhine region, we should feel gratified, so that we can have some optimism about the future development of the country. After the speech, there was thunderous applause. Then, Prime Minister Brüning made a brief speech, recalling Bismarck's contributions to the founding of the Federation. Then the whole audience cheered Long Live Germany, ended with national music, and dispersed.</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 18th - Today is the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the German Federation. The German expatriates here held a celebration meeting at the German Consulate General. The entire German delegation to the League of Nations attended the meeting. Foreign Minister Curtius gave a speech, expressing his gratitude to the expatriates for their unwavering loyalty to the motherland, and elaborated on the development of the solidarity of the German people, saying that this is the most valuable asset of the German people, which all expatriates around the world should cherish and cultivate.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 18th - Germany everywhere today holds the sixtieth anniversary of the German Restoration. After President Hindenburg, who paid his respects to the first emperor after the restoration of the German Empire sixty years ago, reviewed the troops, he shouted the old war slogans to 10,000 veterans, and then said that the Germans had lost a lot, and the German soldiers would never forget it, but fortunately the motherland was safe and sound. The deposed emperor violated the constitution abolishing all medals and prohibiting nationals from accepting medals at this anniversary festival. He sent a letter to a famous lawyer in Berlin and awarded him the Hohenzollern Royal Medal because the lawyer had recently handled a case for the deposed emperor to sue the editor of a newspaper and finally won the case, so the deposed emperor awarded the medal to reward him.</p>

The Minseitō will hold a general meeting on the 20th and the Seiyūkai on the 21st to reorganize their positions and enter the curtain of political warfare. Prime Minister Hamaguchi is not yet fully recovered, and he is quite uneasy about the opposition parties' surprise attacks, especially the issue of the acting prime minister being the focus of attack. In addition, the situation in the upper house is still dangerous. It is difficult to predict whether there will be storms in the future.

<p>At 9:00 AM on the 19th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 95th weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in the auditorium. Central Committee members Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Chen Lifu, Ma Chaojun, Chen Yaoyuan, and Miao Peicheng, as well as staff from various departments and guests, totaling approximately 500 to 600 people, attended. Ding Weifen presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, the Chairman reported, stating that warlords had run rampant in recent years, causing immense suffering to the people. Fortunately, comrades of the Party have worked together to gradually eliminate them, removing a major obstacle to politics. This is a great opportunity for the Party and the nation to turn from danger to safety. Now, at the beginning of the construction period, the government resolutely abolished the likin tax, which has been the biggest drawback for the country for a hundred years, relieving the suffering of merchants and civilians. However, the suffering of the Chinese people is not limited to one aspect. When it comes to living and working in peace and contentment, it is still a distant dream. If the suffering of the people is not completely relieved, then the construction cause cannot be developed in one day. Comrades of the Party, do not think that the warlords have fallen and your responsibility is over. We must continue to struggle, and with the determination and will to defeat the warlords, relieve all the sufferings of the people. On the one hand, we should work hard for the emerging construction of the country, so as to achieve final success. Secondly, Yu Youren reported on the situation of the disaster in Shaanxi, saying that Shaanxi is located in the Yellow River basin, and the general public has always been sympathetic to the national revolution. During the revolutionary period, they helped with material and spiritual support, which has a considerable history. Originally, it was hoped that the Three People’s Principles would be successful, and the people would get considerable benefits. However, the Northwest warlords occupied and ravaged the area, embracing the idea of using poor soldiers to wage wars, supporting feudal forces, and doing everything possible to trample and harass the people. Every grain and animal was plundered, and opium was forced to be planted in order to levy heavy taxes to support the troops and strengthen themselves. The people’s marrow has been sucked dry, and selling wives and children is a common occurrence. They did not show any sympathy for this. In short, all means were used to exploit the people, and they did whatever they wanted. In addition, there were frequent droughts and no harvests for years. In more than 20 counties, including Sanyuan, Jingyang, Wugong, and Xianyang, more than 2 million people starved to death. There are no accurate statistics for various places in southern and northern Shaanxi. The population</p>

<p>that was sold, was taxed at Fenglingdu at five yuan per day, and more than 400,000 people were openly sold out of the country from there. Roadsides were full of barren land, and houses were demolished for cooking, reducing people’s residences by eight out of ten. According to Sun and Feng, two division commanders under Yang Hucheng, soldiers under their command asked for leave to return to their hometowns due to frequent expeditions and the disaster in their hometowns, so as to visit their families. When they returned to their hometowns, they could not see their parents, wives, and children, nor their families in 19 out of 10 cases. This is a rare catastrophe in thousands of years. The more than 400,000 people who were sold were all caused by the evils of Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan. It can also be said that they were sold by Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan. Harsh government is fiercer than a tiger, and the result is so. It’s really heartbreaking. My report today is not because of my hometown relationship.</p>
<p>Speaking from the local standpoint is a matter that the country should pay attention to in the entire political situation. Although it can be said that it was the sin of the warlords in the past, our Party should also bear some political responsibility. Now that the political pain has been reduced, the timing of saving lives and helping the wounded is still very urgent. I hope everyone will have compassion and quickly find ways to provide relief. After the report, the meeting adjourned at 10 o’clock.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Chonghui, Wang Boqun, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, He Yaozu, Ma Fuxiang, He Chengjunn, Ding Chaowu, Xia Douyin, Wang Jinyu, Liu Shangqing, Zhang Huichang, Wei Daoming, Lin Xiang, Chen Yi, Wu Siyu, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Wohua, Feng Yifei, Yu Jishi, Zhang Wohua, and all members of the Internal Affairs Conference, as well as staff from the two departments of civil affairs and military affairs of the National Government, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Chiang Kai-shek presided over the meeting, led the ceremony, and then gave a work report, explaining the origin of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen’s ideology. He said that the National Internal Affairs Conference had opened last week, and there were many proposals from all parties, with good results. The Belgian concession in Tianjin has been officially recovered. This is the work we planned to do. We must also achieve the goal of completely abolishing unequal treaties within this year. In this regard, the people should have a correct understanding, especially the journalists who are the national teachers, should take the interests of the country as their own interests, stand on the position of the people to criticize everything, and guide the entire people. Do not be emotional or speak for your own rights. For example, the Shanghai Times' criticism of our diplomatic authorities this time did not understand this principle at all. Now the domestic bandits and communists are rampant, and the international situation is getting worse. I hope everyone, especially the civil affairs officials who are close to the people in various provinces, will join our Party and work together, because only by joining our Party can individuals have the opportunity to show their talents, otherwise it will be a loss to the country. You don’t have to have any opinions about joining the Party sooner or later, it doesn’t matter. The most important thing is to join immediately after understanding the principles of joining the Party. Representatives participating in the Internal Affairs Conference, if you are willing to join the Party, I can be responsible for introducing you. The Three People's Principles are inherent to our China, and are the orthodox ideology that has been nurtured by our four thousand years of moral culture to the present. It is the only name for saving China that the late Premier Sun Yat-sen created by adopting the advantages of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. All citizens should understand it. Some people have not studied the Three People's Principles, or they have studied it but have not grasped its central point, so they still hold doubts or objections. This is very wrong. After the speech (the original manuscript will be published after整理), the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Inauguration of the National Government Guard Division and Brigade Commanders <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The commander of the Guard Division of the National Government, Feng Yifei, the deputy division commander Yu Jishi, the infantry brigade commanders Zhang Cheng, Yang Bufei, Jiang Fusheng, and the artillery brigade commander Xiang Zhizhuang, took the oath of office at 10:00 AM on the 19th in the auditorium of the National Government after the weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Chonghui presided over the oath. After the ceremony, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presented the seal. Division Commander Feng received the seal, and then led Deputy Division Commander Yu and the brigade commanders to raise their right hands and take the oath. The supervisor gave a training speech, saying that today is the day for the Guard Division Commander of the National Government, Feng Yifei, Deputy Division Commander Yu Jishi, and the brigade commanders to take the oath of office. Recalling the 11th year of the Republic of China, when Chen Jiongming rebelled, the guard team of the Presidential Palace was small, but they were able to resist bravely. Now the whole country has been unified, and there will never be such incidents again. However, I hope that you will still maintain the revolutionary spirit of the previous guard team and continue to fight. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen once told the officers and soldiers that although the enemy has retreated, we cannot be old-fashioned, we must still be energetic, and we must fight for our principles. Therefore, revolutionary soldiers should believe in the Three People's Principles in order to have revolutionary goals, and only with revolutionary goals can we have revolutionary spirit. The duties of the National Government Guard are very important. I hope that comrades Feng and Yu will be able to fulfill their duties and be models for revolutionary soldiers after taking office. Then, Chairman Chiang gave a training speech, saying that today is the day for the commanders of the Guard Division of the National Government and the brigade commanders to take office. I hope that after taking office, you will live up to the government's expectations and be a model army. No matter what, everything should be improved from small to large, and the same is true for the political army. I hope you will have the revolutionary courage of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen to set an example for the national army, and I have great expectations. Then, Division Commander Feng replied, saying that Yifei and others know that the duties of the National Government Guard are heavy. We will sincerely work hard after taking office, both in peacetime and wartime, so as not to disappoint the expectations of the Party and the government. After the ceremony, they went to the airport to review the troops, and the military appearance was neat and rarely seen. It is found that the division was originally formed by merging the First Teaching Division and the former National Government Guard Brigade. There are more than 30,000 officers and soldiers, and the weapons and equipment are the most modern. The division headquarters is divided into seven offices, one group, and one hospital.

<p>Xu Xianshi Scheduled to Return to the Construction Department on the 16th</p>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence. Cheng Shihui, the director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, and Xu Xianshi, the director of the Construction Department, returned to the province from Shanghai at the end of last year. Cheng resumed his post immediately, but Xu's proposal to build a bridge and build a dike has not been resolved, so he intends to wait for Yang Shuzhuang to return to the province for consultation before resuming his post. The current acting director, Jiang Pingfan, has been negative in his attitude since the case of the complaint occurred, and he is very eager to leave. He has not been to the office for many days and has ordered the departments and offices to handle the end. Important official affairs have been suspended. Therefore, Yang Shuzhuang telegraphed Xu a few days ago, instructing him to resume his post first. Regarding the construction funds, he will plan after returning to the province. Xu then scheduled to go to the office on the 16th. The agricultural, commercial, and industrial groups in the provincial capital heard the news, and then elected representatives to Xu's residence on the 14th, accusing the obstruction of the bridge gate at the northern end of Wanshou Bridge, which caused ten major harms to water conservancy and navigation, and demanded the continuation of bridge construction and the cessation of dike construction to facilitate transportation. Xu said that the bridge has been broken, and it is difficult to restore it to its original state, and there is a contract with the Japanese, which seems difficult to change. However, the Construction Department originally planned to obstruct 12 holes in the bridge gate, leaving only 24 holes, and the river surface that obstructs the bridge gate will be built as a dike, and merchants will be recruited to sell it. The income will be used to fill the bridge construction cost. Now that the bridge gate is not obstructed, there is no land to sell, and the project must be increased by one-third. The original construction cost is not available. This still requires some hesitation. As for the case of Jiang Pingfan and Lin Enpu's complaint, after two summons by the Procuratorate of the Minhou District Court, it was considered that the investigation procedures have been completed, and the prosecutor Yang Chongshi has prepared the prosecution statement, which was submitted to the chief prosecutor Chen Shirong for review, and then the public prosecution was filed with the criminal court. However, Yang Shuzhuang had a telegram to the provincial government regarding this case, stating that the bridge construction involved the law, and the district procuratorate actually had a warrant to summon Director Jiang, which caused a great loss of government prestige. Please inform the High Court to handle it with caution, etc. Therefore, Wang Fengxiong, the president of the High Court, also advocated careful handling, and has telegraphed the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instructions. In addition, the dike construction project has been stopped since the occurrence of the control earthquake, and the bridge construction project is only a small number of workers dismantling stone slabs on the Jiangnan Bridge.

<h3 id="e71">Liaoning Province Implements Abolishing Likin <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Finance Department Orders All Tax Bureaus to Stop Collecting Taxes Immediately</p>
<p>Shenyang correspondence. All likin taxes in all provinces of the country, and all donations and taxes similar to likin, have been explicitly ordered by the central government to be abolished from January 1. Although the northeastern provinces have never had likin or other names, there are quite a few donations and taxes similar to likin. In order to obey the explicit order of the central government and relieve the suffering of the people, Deputy Commander Zhang has telegraphed the northeastern provinces a few days ago to follow the instructions. The Finance Department of Liaoning Province has repeatedly considered this case.</p>
<p>The sales tax levied in the northeastern provinces has a huge annual income, and military and political expenses rely on it. Once it is abolished, the loss to the provincial treasury will be not small. Director Zhang Zhenlu and the chairman of the provincial government, Zang Shiyi, have seriously studied it, and they should ask for a postponement due to the special circumstances of the eastern provinces. Later, Zhang's vice-commander replied by telegram, urging immediate implementation to show his sincerity in supporting the central government, and ordering the establishment of business tax and special consumption tax to compensate for the losses. After receiving the order, Director Zhang immediately convened a meeting of the section chiefs, secretaries, and directors of the three bureaus in the provincial capital to discuss the results. They all agreed that although the current sales tax in the province is the business tax promulgated by the central government, and the special consumption tax is the current production tax in the province, the collection methods and tax rates are different. We should follow the business tax and special consumption tax promulgated by the central government, and refer to the situation in our province to formulate the interim regulations and collection rules for each tax, and submit them to the provincial government for approval and promulgation. At the same time, on the 13th, a substitute telegram was issued, ordering all tax bureaus to immediately stop collecting taxes from the date of the order. Director Zhang of the Finance Department also took a special train to Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 12th to pay respects to Vice Commander Zhang and Minister of Finance Song to discuss all financial matters in the Northeast. It is said that he will return to Shenyang in one or two days. (January 13)</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Plague in Haining is Rampant <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou correspondence. Since the beginning of winter, Haining has discovered an epidemic, which has become more rampant in recent days. More than ten people die every day. The original doctors are not enough to be distributed. Although the provincial authorities have sent doctors from the provincial infectious disease hospital and the municipal hospital to assist, the funding is very difficult. Now Haining's public groups have specially recommended Pang Jingqi, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and Xia Canglin, the member of the Haining County Health Committee, to come to the province to petition the provincial government. According to Xia, the epidemic has been rampant for more than a month, and its scope is about dozens of miles, including Zhuqiao, Yingshumiao, Renjiacun, Shilicun, Jinshicun, Wangjiamiao, and Yuanhua, with Zhuqiao being the most prevalent. The number of deaths is about 400. Newly spread areas include Zhuqiao, Jinxianba, and Fujiaba. Other areas along the Huhang Road in Xucun, Chang'an, and Xieqiao have also been affected. The epidemic is indeed epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. At the beginning of the disease, there is only mild headache or mild numbness in the limbs, palpitations and rapid pulse, or vomiting. Patients often do not pay attention. Severely ill people fall asleep and die within two or three hours, and some die after two or three days. The characteristics of the disease are no high fever and less opisthotonos. The pupils also do not change, and those with purplish spots on the face die at the speed of light. The bacteria seen in the examination are also larger than usual. The age of the dead is mostly from ten to thirty years old, very few are forty or fifty years old, and few are children under five years old. There are more men and fewer women. Now the Haining County Temporary Epidemic Prevention Committee has held many meetings. Two epidemic prevention stations have been set up, one in Yingshumiao and one in Zhuqiao. The isolation ward in Yingshumiao is handled by the Provincial Infectious Disease Hospital. The epidemic prevention station has organized two patrol injection teams, and burial teams, propaganda teams, and disinfection teams. More than 6,000 people have been injected with the preventive vaccine, and more than 180 people have been treated. Now that the epidemic has not subsided, I am deeply afraid that it will be even more unthinkable in the spring, so I have come to the province to petition. The secretary-general of the province, Nie, has met with them on behalf of the government. Regarding the request for relief, it will be submitted to the provincial government meeting tomorrow (20th) to discuss the solution.</p>

<p>A Flower Merchant's Account Leads to a Murder Case Yu Yinde from Shanghai has been selling flowers for a living. Last autumn, he collected cotton from farmers in the Shanghai area, totaling 14,000 yuan, which was all owed and not paid. Farmers repeatedly urged him to pay, so Yu avoided debts in Shanghai and dared not go home. Recently, Yu entrusted his brother Yu Jinde with 2,500 yuan to pay off the debts in order to end this matter. The content of the payments was divided into three types: 10%, 30%, and 50%. The day before yesterday, Yu Jinde invited the farmers to his home to pay off the debts and explained the reasons for the apportionment. However, the farmers felt that they were losing too much and expressed their unwillingness. Nearly a hundred people arrived at that time, and there was a lot of discussion and the order was chaotic. Yu Jinde saw that the matter was fruitless and feared that an accident would happen, so he wanted to go to the police detachment stationed there and ask them to send police to maintain order. The farmers saw that Yu was going out and feared that he would escape, so they all followed him out. When they arrived in front of the detachment, the police glanced at the large number of people and did not understand their intentions, so they fired a row of shots into the sky. However, the crowd did not retreat and fired several shots horizontally, killing a farmer named Liu Shaoqing. The crowd saw the trouble and dispersed in panic. On the one hand, they sent people to the city to file a complaint and ask for an autopsy, and asked for severe punishment for the person who caused the trouble. Yesterday, the trial officer went to the countryside for an autopsy and detained Yu Jinde, waiting for the county to try the case. The trial officer Lu ordered him to hand over his brother Yu Yinde within seven days and pay a deposit of 14,000 yuan before he could be released temporarily. However, Yu Jinde was detained pending review because he had no guarantor.</p>

It was about twenty feet in circumference and about three feet high, which was very peculiar.</p>
<p>The Issue of Concurrent Positions of Chamber of Commerce Committee Members The reorganization of the Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce into the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce was held on the 15th of this month. The executive and supervisory committee members were elected, and Shi Junqing was elected as the chairman. The official establishment meeting was scheduled to be held on the 20th, but the date of establishment was postponed due to the issue of whether the newly elected committee members could concurrently hold the positions of alternate executive committee members and supervisory committee members. The Chamber of Commerce Election Law does not stipulate that it is still under study. However, the postponement date must be determined after the new chairman Shi Junqing returns to Suzhou from Beijing.</p>

<p>Telegrams Requested Interpretation of the Litigation Mediation Agency The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce recently checked the provisions of Article 2 of the Civil Mediation Law and Article 3, Paragraph 4 of the Chamber of Commerce Law. For personnel litigation cases, the Chamber of Commerce should belong to the mediation agency for industrial and commercial operators. Yesterday, it specially telegraphed the Judicial Yuan and requested an explicit interpretation, and ordered it to be observed. It also sent telegrams to the Chambers of Commerce in Nanjing and Shanghai, and the Chambers of Commerce in the counties of Jiangsu Province, to advocate unity. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Wang Junjian, the President of the Nanjing Judicial Yuan, according to Article 2 of the Civil Mediation Law, personnel litigation cases and civil cases under the jurisdiction of the primary level, unless the mediation is not established by other mediation agencies, or the mediation director considers that mediation is not possible, they shall not be dismantled unless the mediation is not established by the civil mediation office. The Judiciary also stipulates in Article 6 of the matters that should be paid attention to in handling mediation that the other agencies mentioned in Article 2 of the Civil Mediation Law should be limited to those stipulated by law, such as Article 6 of the current Labor Dispute Office Law, etc. If the mediation has not been established, it should be certified by the original mediation agency, or declared by both parties, etc. Check Article 3 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, the duties of the Chamber of Commerce, Paragraph 4, matters concerning the mediation and arbitration of industry and commerce. The wording is indeed of a mediation nature. Can Article 2 of the Civil Mediation Law be applied as another mediation agency? I dare to telegraph and ask for your review, and quickly give an explicit interpretation to comply with it, so as to prevent litigation and stabilize commerce."</p>
<p>Meeting to Discuss the Apportionment of Silk Industry Bonds After the State Council approved the relief silk industry bonds, the amount of the bonds was changed from 10 million yuan to 7 million yuan, and recently changed to 8 million yuan. 6 million yuan will be used as a live auction to relieve silk factories, and 2 million yuan will be used to govern the root cause and run the sericulture business in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. However, for the apportionment method, each silk factory mainly apportions according to the number of cars, and a third party mainly uses exported raw silk as the standard. After the silk merchants repeatedly strived for it, they were allowed to apportion half according to the number of cars and half according to exported raw silk. Now the government has decided to start registering from the 20th of this month to the 31st of May. Fellow silk factory operators in Xidi believe that the apportionment method is still not in line with the original plan jointly decided by fellow operators in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, and the third party is manipulating it. Jianglai gains and losses are of great importance. Yesterday, a special meeting was called to discuss the matter in the guild hall. More than 40 representatives from 34 factories attended. Chairman Qian Fenghao reported in detail on the progress of the case, the recent trends, and the gains and losses in the future. After discussion, everyone unanimously advocated apportioning according to the number of cars according to the original plan, and asked the representatives to Shanghai this time to strive for it with all their strength. If necessary, all factories in Wuxi will go to Shanghai to petition, in order to achieve the goal of truly relieving silk factories and the majority of workers.</p>

In the case of the prostitute Hua Xiren (also known as Lu Fengzhen) committing suicide by poisoning, Li Changyi and Li Houpei, who had close ties with Hua, were detained by the Fifth Precinct, and the court was notified to send a prosecutor. Together with forensic officials, they went to Shengshou Temple for an examination. Lu Xuemei (Hua's uncle), a relative, rushed to request exemption from the examination. Li and others confessed to the Fifth Precinct that Hua committed suicide due to heartbreak. However, in her suicide note, Hua stated that she went to Li Changyi's place to withdraw 1,600 yuan in savings, but he refused to pay. In addition, her lover went elsewhere, leading her to take her own life. Li and others have now been transferred by the Fifth Precinct to the court for interrogation.

<p>Investigation Confirms Misconduct of the Director of the Construction Bureau. The Construction Department has repeatedly received accusations from local people against Yao Pengnian, the director of the Construction Bureau, for various acts of embezzlement and misconduct. Yu Dingming was appointed to conduct a thorough investigation in Tongzhou. When Yu requested to review the account books from Yao, Yao refused to hand them over. Yu telegraphed the department for instructions. On the 17th, a telegram was received in reply, ordering Yao to hand over the books immediately and warning that severe penalties would be imposed if he dared to conceal or delay.

<p>Mortgaging Foil Business Tax for Loans. The Zhejiang Finance Department convened a discussion meeting yesterday to continue negotiating loans. As a result, all old debts owed to the province and their collaterals will continue to be maintained according to the previous contracts. For the new loan, it was originally proposed to mortgage 2.3 million in three types of debt tax coupons to borrow 2 million in cash. However, with the implementation of the abolition of likin, it is difficult to establish this. After repeated consultations, it was changed to mortgage 2.2 million in foil business tax from the entire province for the new debt. Banking circles have expressed their agreement, so the loan is expected to be established within days.</p>

<p>Proposal to Merge Taiping Township. The proposal to merge Taiping Township in Nanhui has been discussed repeatedly without a result. Now, local gentry Jiang Jie and others have reiterated the previous proposal at this county administrative meeting. The reasons are roughly as follows: the area of the township extends from Zhangang in the east to Qianbu Jing in the west, a total of more than twenty li in length from east to west, and about three li from north to south. It is an important channel for the seven vertical trunk rivers of our Fengxian to flow into the sea, and also the throat of the entire county. However, due to this relationship, obstacles arise in administration. For example, in terms of arrests, the bandits who burned and looted Zhuangxing the year before all hid in the township. In the kidnapping and robbery cases in the past few months, the township has also been a den for hiding. The southern bandits are unable to fully govern due to their limited resources, while our county is limited by the county boundary and cannot search and suppress them, resulting in it gradually becoming a hotbed of all evils. Therefore, merging it into Fengxian is a matter of urgent importance and will achieve the effect of limbs and arms coordinating. It is understood that after the case was passed by the general meeting, County Magistrate Shen Qingchen added a letter of explanation yesterday, along with boundary maps, and submitted it to the provincial civil construction departments for instructions.</p>
<p>Pensions for Descendants of Original Donors to Charities. Dong Zhiliang, a descendant of the original donors to the Qingcun Port Infant Asylum, recently intended to recover the fields donated to the asylum by his ancestors to manage them himself to supplement his studies and meals due to his family's financial difficulties. The asylum considered the matter to be unprecedented, so it requested the county for approval the day before. It is now understood that the county has approved the case, stating that the fields have long been donated for the purpose of feeding the poor, so the right to manage them should belong to the relief organization. The request for personal management cannot be approved. However, considering the relationship as descendants of the original donors and the fact that the family is indeed poor, appropriate subsidies should be given to show compassion. At the same time, it was decided at the county political meeting that in addition to the annual allocation of 100 yuan for pensions from the field rents, each of his three children will receive an additional 50 yuan per year for tuition fees to promote their education.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Letter from Lin &amp; Co., No. 39 Sichuan Road, This City <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>In the Wuxi correspondence column of your newspaper on the 16th of this month, it was stated that the seven silk factories in Wuxi, including Shengyu, Wansheng No. 1 and No. 2 factories (mistakenly written as Yisheng), Jintai, Ruifu, and Taifu, all contracted with Lin &amp; Co. in Shanghai to supply coal for their use. However, recently, the company has failed to deliver the coal, causing the seven silk factories to have no coal to burn and unable to operate, resulting in the unemployment of tens of thousands of workers. This is inconsistent with the facts. It is hereby clarified that our company signed coal supply contracts with silk factories such as Shengyu, stipulating the pricing standards and payment dates. If the silk factories fail to pay according to the contract, our company is entitled to suspend coal delivery and demand compensation for losses. After the contracts were established, our company supplied coal according to the contracts and never caused any coal shortages for the silk factories. However, the silk factories have been inexplicably underpaying or delaying payments without reason, failing to pay despite repeated reminders and ignoring mediation efforts. Our company needs funds to purchase coal, and our capital is at stake. We cannot afford to compensate for losses, so we had no choice but to declare the termination of the contracts in accordance with the contract terms. The factories have instead claimed that our company breached the contract by failing to supply coal, causing the silk factories to be unable to operate and resulting in the unemployment of tens of thousands of workers, spreading this message everywhere. It is not known that some of these factories only operate for ten to twenty days a month, while others have already ceased operations due to the decline in silk prices and their own failure. How is this related to our company? Moreover, there are many coal companies. If the factories have money, they can purchase coal from other companies for burning. There is no reason for labor disputes to arise simply because the contracts with our company have been terminated. The correspondence in your newspaper is contrary to the facts and affects our company's reputation. We hereby send this letter to clarify the facts and request a fair correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lin &amp; Co., Shanghai</p>

<p>Already Telegraphed to the U.S. Department of Commerce</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, the American Chamber of Commerce in this city has telegraphed the U.S. Department of Commerce in Washington, stating that providing a silver loan to China at this time would be harmful and unhelpful to the Chinese market and trade with China and foreign countries. This telegram is in response to the proposal by Senator Pittman and the International Silver Committee to lend 20 million taels of silver to China to promote trade with China and foreign countries. The American Chamber of Commerce believes that China still needs to pay in gold for purchasing goods from abroad, and this type of loan is of no benefit to trade with China and foreign countries. After a thorough discussion among the leaders of the American Chamber of Commerce in this city, this telegram was sent to oppose the silver loan.</p>

<p>Inauguration of the Shanghai County Relocation Design Committee</p>
<p>Minutes of the First Meeting</p>
<p>The issue of relocating the Shanghai County seat has been addressed by the establishment of a Design Committee comprised of fifteen committee members, tasked with deliberating and advancing the project. Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, the committee members convened at the County Government auditorium for their inauguration ceremony. Attendees included committee members Shi She, Wang Li, Peng Zhaotang, Peng Liren, Wu Wenhua, Ye Dezhen, Lu Zhe, Niu Changyao, Ge Xiusheng, Shen Zhou, Yang Fulin, Wang Chengyao, and Bi Huan, totaling thirteen individuals. Absent were Qin Xitian and Wu Jingqing. Following the inauguration ceremony, the committee members initiated their inaugural meeting, chaired by Wu Wenhua with Li Tongrui serving as the recording secretary. After customary formalities, Chairman Wu Wenhua delivered an introductory address, highlighting that since the division of Shanghai into county and municipality, the original county seat, situated within the municipal area, had posed considerable challenges to administrative operations. Therefore, for the sake of operational efficiency, the relocation of the Shanghai County seat had become a consensus demand between the government and the populace. Former County Magistrate Lu had previously outlined plans, but due to various unresolved issues, the project had been suspended. Since taking office, County Magistrate Yan had given significant attention to this matter, resulting in a resolution by the fifty-fourth County Council meeting to establish a Design Committee to oversee the project. With this inaugural meeting, it was hoped that all members would contribute their opinions and engage in collaborative discussions to ensure the swift realization of this relocation plan, as deeply desired. Subsequently, the committee deliberated and resolved various matters: (1) Approval of the Detailed Rules for the Committee's Operations, passed with revisions. Cases two and three are omitted. (4) Regarding the date for on-site surveys of the County Seat location, it was resolved to schedule it for ten o'clock in the morning on the 31st of this month. The meeting adjourned at nearly twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>Appendix: Detailed Rules for the Design Committee's Operations. (Article 1) These Detailed Rules are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Committee's Constitution.

<p>Discussion Situation: After the meeting opened yesterday morning, the secretariat first reported on the resolutions of the second general meeting. Then, based on the review report, the station affairs group was discussed, starting from case 182, and the second review report ended at case 25. The road bureau made reports or explanations on various cases. The details are as follows: (1) Case 61: Representative Zheng Baozhao from the road bureau reported that the monthly expenditure of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is 400,000 (including road maintenance costs). The principal of the loan to the Sino-British Company is 75,000 pounds, and the interest payment is 30,000 pounds and some change. The daily income of the road bureau is only over 10,000. The freight cost is 1.1%, and the passenger cost is 0.95%, which may increase to 1.2% from the 20th. Reducing freight rates is impossible. Case 65: The road bureau reported that the current transportation price of silk is 0.6% per ton per kilometer, which has now increased to 0.8%. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway charges 50% of the freight rate, and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway charges 2.25 yuan for items within 60 kilograms. Case 23: The road bureau reported that the baggage package rate is 6.25 jiao per 50 kilograms, which is doubled instead of increasing by half. The actual calculation is only 0.168. Extension of the Meeting Period: At the morning general meeting yesterday, it was proposed to extend the meeting period, which was approved by the public decision. The fourth general meeting will continue to be held from 3:00 p.m. today (the 19th) to continue discussing the review report. Review meetings of various groups will be held that evening to review all cases that have not been submitted to the general meeting for resolution in the agenda for the 19th.</p>
<p>Resolutions of Various Cases: First Review Report (Station Affairs Group) Case 183: Amended and passed according to the review opinions. The case is reserved and the road bureau is requested to contact the various transfer companies to handle it. Case 84 passed. (Freight Group) Case 48: Amended and passed according to the review opinions. (1) Regarding the reduction of the grade of miscellaneous goods and piece goods, it seems that there is a reason why it cannot be reduced further. (A) The current freight rate for domestically produced piece goods transported from Shanghai South Station to Hangzhou is 3.734 yuan per ton. For imported piece goods, the freight rate is 6.506 yuan per ton, which is 2.77 yuan more expensive. The road bureau has specially reduced the freight rate for domestically produced piece goods. (B) There are many types of miscellaneous goods, and they can be shipped separately, charging fees according to the freight rates of each grade. Merchants should not suffer losses. (2) Regarding the addition of special trains during the tea cocoon transportation period, if there are sufficient locomotives, the road bureau may be requested to consider adding special trains. Cases 49 to 61 were all passed according to the original text of the review report. Case 62 was amended and passed. The reason why it cannot be reduced further is that the new chapter price has already been reduced. The transportation costs of the two railways are different, and it is difficult to equalize the freight rates. Cases 63 to 66, and 65 were passed in their original text. Cases 67 and 51 were amended and passed according to the review opinions. The transportation cost of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is very high, and no profit can be obtained below the fourth-class price, and paper goods are mostly within the fourth and fifth-class prices. It does not seem appropriate to reduce the freight rates, but regarding the statement in the original proposal that most of the paper goods are transported by water, it is proposed that the road bureau send personnel to investigate the actual situation and formulate appropriate measures to attract more customers. Case 68 was passed in its original text. Second Review Report (Transportation Group) Case 19: Passed according to the review results in its original text. The congestion of passengers in the Xichang section is a fact, but according to the report of the road bureau, it is due to the reduction in the traction of the locomotive, and the vehicles towed by each train have reached the maximum limit, so passenger cars cannot be added. However, to avoid congestion, the road bureau should try its best to find a solution within a possible range. Regarding the hygiene on the train, the road bureau reported that hygiene inspectors have been dispatched to check at any time, and attendants are on the train to provide services. The road bureau should strictly order these personnel to seriously handle the hygiene on the train. Case 20 is the same as case 19. Case 21 was passed after review. According to the report of the road bureau, the addition of freight cars is difficult due to the limited traction of the locomotive. However, the time for fresh goods is important, and the road bureau should try to arrange transportation as soon as possible. Case 22 was passed after review. The direct passenger train to Beijing and Shanghai has as many as 19 passenger cars. If freight cars are added, it is also limited by the locomotive power and it is difficult to handle. However, regional trains can be added, and the road bureau should do so. As for the improvement of vehicles for loading fresh goods, there is a solution in case 7. Case 23 was passed after review. This case requested the slow train to tow chestnuts, dates, and Gorgon fruit. The review method is the same as the first section of case 22. As for the request to waive the half-price freight rate, it has been transferred to the Freight Group Review Committee for review. Case 24 was passed after review. The road bureau should earnestly handle the prompt allocation of vehicles. As for the responsibility for freight transportation, it should be incorporated into the review of cases 97, 98, 99, and 100. Case 25 was passed after review. According to the report of the road bureau, although there was a lack of vehicles during the military period, the road has made great efforts to maintain commercial transportation. Now that the military situation has ended, and the road has decided to add 200 freight cars, measures should be taken to adjust the vehicles for commercial transportation in the future, so that transportation can be smooth. The committee believes that this method of the road bureau is complete and should be earnestly handled by the road bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Afternoon Fourth Session <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Discussion Circumstances: The fourth session of the conference continued from 2 PM, starting with the discussion of the 26 proposals from the Transportation Group. All review reports from the three groups were approved unanimously, with no disputes among the representatives. Progress was smooth. It was decided that after the adjournment, the Review Committee and the Declaration Drafting Committee would continue their work. The designated review committee members included Mr. Zheng Baozhao, the representative from the Railway Bureau. He reported during the meeting that the monthly expenditure of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway (including road maintenance costs) was 720,000 yuan, with an annual repayment of £116,000 and interest of £69,600. Daily revenue was over 30,000 yuan. The freight charge per kilometer per ton was 6.06 cents, and passenger transport was 6.6 cents, which will increase to 8 cents to 1 cent in twenty years. Comparing freight rates for 312 kilometers between Shanghai and Nanjing, the fare was 1 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, 3 li, 2 hao; Tianjin-Pukou was 3 yuan, 0 fen, 6 li, 2 hao; Beijing-Liaoning was 3 yuan, 1 jiao, 7 fen; Longhai was 3 yuan, 5 jiao, 0 fen, 8 li; and Beijing-Hankou was 9 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 fen, all showing increases.</p>
<p>Resolutions on Various Proposals: Proposal No. 26 from the "Transportation Group" was approved after review. (1) Regarding the allocation of five carriages daily, it was noted that empty carriages at Wusong Station were allocated from Ma Station, and the number of loaded carriages arriving at Ma Station daily varied. It was difficult to specify a fixed number. However, given the importance of coal transportation for various factories, the Railway Bureau should try its best to facilitate this within its capabilities. Proposal No. 27 was approved after review. It was found that the regulation on the time empty carriages could stay at Zhenjiang Station was difficult to implement in practice. However, to facilitate commerce, the Railway Bureau should consider appropriate measures. Proposal No. 28 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to allocate as many carriages as possible. Proposal No. 29 was approved after review, noting that it was difficult to specify the number of carriages to be allocated daily, but requesting the Railway Bureau to allocate as many as possible. Proposal No. 30 was the same as Proposal No. 28. Proposal No. 31 was the same as Proposal No. 3. Proposal No. 32 was approved after review. The number of freight cars on both railways was explained in the overview of the scheduling of passenger and freight cars on both lines. There was no detention of vehicles during the period of military pacification. Proposal No. 33 was approved after review. The Railway Bureau usually runs special trains during the silkworm cocoon season. However, during this year's cocoon season, the shipment of a large quantity of relief rice was being transported, causing some delays. The railway has now decided to lease 100 freight cars, and should allocate sufficient cars in the future to avoid delays. This committee believes that the Railway Bureau's approach is satisfactory and should be implemented effectively. Proposal No. 34 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to implement it accordingly. Proposal No. 35 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to consider it after the Taiping locomotive is in operation. Proposal No. 36 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to order the station affairs inspectors at Nanjing Station to liaise and handle the matter at any time when empty cars are urgently needed in the Beijing railway. Proposal No. 37 was approved after review. According to the Railway Bureau's report, the original passenger cars on the Songhu branch line have already been allocated for use on the main line, and there are no spare cars that can be lent. The Railway Bureau should consider arranging this after the new batch of 24 passenger cars are assembled and leave the factory. Proposal Nos. 109, 110, 111, and 112 from the "Station Affairs Group" were approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to jointly discuss and plan implementation with the Wuxi County Construction Bureau, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, and relevant organizations to achieve realization. Proposal No. 113 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to promptly build a storage area next to the platform at Wuxi Station for storing silk. Proposal Nos. 114, 115, and 116 were approved after review, finding that the original intention of relocating or adding Shangbei freight depots to the north side of the station to allow for separate loading and unloading of import and export goods was very good. However, the Railway Bureau faced the following difficulties: 1. There is no certainty whether the land north of Chegu has already been leased and can be reclaimed. Assuming a move to the north side, the shunting work would be extremely difficult. Extending and expanding the existing freight depot would also be impossible. The Railway Bureau should find an appropriate solution. Proposal No. 117 was approved after review, noting that the matter falls under the Railway Bureau's administration and the committee is unable to accept it. Direct contact should be made with the Railway Bureau. Proposal No. 118 was approved after review: (1) The Railway Bureau has already purchased cars, so the first item does not need to be discussed. (2) Maintain the original method to avoid delaying the schedule of freight trains. (3) Please adopt and implement the Railway Bureau's selection. Proposal No. 119 was approved after review, finding that the seven freight depots at Maigen Road were sufficient and there was no need to add any more for the time being. Proposal No. 120 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to appropriately widen the freight depot and, within a reasonable period, construct a pier canopy to achieve perfection. Proposal No. 121 was approved after review, noting that the Railway Bureau's Traffic Department has already planned the construction, and requesting the Railway Bureau to proceed quickly. Proposal No. 122 was approved after review, noting that the Railway Bureau already has a plan to rebuild the freight depot at that station. Proposal No. 123 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to find ways to expand it. Proposal No. 124 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to consider adding a canopy to provide relief. Proposal No. 125 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to consider the situation and build a small-scale freight depot by the river at that station. Proposal No. 136 was approved after review, noting that the Railway Bureau already has a grand plan for improving Rihui Port, and requesting the Railway Bureau to proceed with it according to the original plan, considering the situation. Proposal No. 137 was approved after review, noting that regarding the problem of excrement accumulation, the Railway Bureau should strictly order the contractor to quickly clear it out. The issue of river port silting has been addressed by the Railway Bureau's Engineering Department on a regular basis, so it does not need to be discussed. Regarding the issue of adding tarpaulins, the Railway Bureau should consider adding some to meet urgent needs. Proposal No. 138 was approved after review, noting that this case is not within the jurisdiction of the two railways and is not suitable for discussion. Proposal No. 139 was approved after review: Item A, (1) Ma Station is spacious, and installing iron fences would be costly and difficult to accomplish in the short term. (2) Loading and unloading workers should be provided with copper badges attached to their arms and recorded by number for inspection. (3) Workers leaving the station must be inspected. The labor unions of the two railways should properly develop measures. Item B: Investigating the replacement of the area where goods are loaded and unloaded with stone slabs would be costly and difficult to accomplish in the short term. The Railway Bureau should consider it when freight traffic increases. Proposal No. 140 was approved after review: (1) It is indeed necessary, and the Railway Bureau should consider adding it. (2) The station lights are already being installed by the Railway Bureau. (3) Covering the overpass seems necessary, and the Railway Bureau should consider it. Proposal No. 141 was approved after review, noting that the land east of Songjiang Station belongs to the Railway Bureau and is not a branch road. The committee is not in a position to discuss whether the coal layer should be removed. Proposal No. 142 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to consider extending it. Proposal No. 143 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to first consider extending the awning at the station name. As for the awning on the opposite platform, it must wait until the Railway Bureau is financially sound before further consideration. Proposal No. 144 was approved after review, requesting the Railway Bureau to plan the expansion of fire-fighting equipment on the entire line to prevent accidents. Proposal No. 161 was approved after review, noting that the location for cargo delivery must be based on the customer's wishes, and the Railway Bureau should not interfere. Therefore, if the customer needs to change the unloading location, please contact the Railway Bureau directly. Further discussion is needed. Proposal No. 164 was approved after review, finding that the station where goods are loaded and unloaded is determined by the customer, and the Railway Bureau cannot restrict it. This case cannot be established. Proposal No. 174 was approved after review: A. The land at Ma Station has always been swept and cleaned by the cargo owners themselves. The remaining land has been contracted to Yu Yongtai, and the revenue is collected by the Railway Bureau's accounting department, not divided between superiors and subordinates. B. A cement wall has already been built on the north side of the station, and building it on the south side would be too expensive and difficult. The Railway should issue a notice to the railway police to strictly prevent and prohibit unauthorized personnel from entering. C. Numbering barges falls within the scope of municipal administration, and the Railway Bureau is unable to handle this matter. This item is not suitable for discussion. Proposal No. 69 from the "Freight Rate Group" was approved after review, noting that Chinese and foreign goods have different grades, and the grade of domestic goods is already lower. Proposal No. 70 was approved after review, noting that the freight rate for native cloth is already low, reduced by half compared to before, and does not need to be reduced further. Proposal No. 71 was approved after review, noting that this matter concerns all railways in the country. The original proposer should prepare a detailed list of raw materials and submit it to the Ministry of Industry, which will forward it to the Ministry of Railways for review. Proposal No. 72 was approved after review, noting that the current 50-kilogram freight rate is already half lower than before, and cannot be reduced further. Proposal No. 73 was approved after review, finding that large quantities of rice, wheat, and flour are transported from Wuhu to Shanghai by ice transport. To recover this loss, the Railway Bureau is requested to consider reducing the freight rate for these goods. Proposal No. 74 was approved after review, finding that the freight rate for soybean oil from Changzhou to Ningbo under the old regulations was 1 yuan, 3 jiao, 5 fen per ton, plus 10% making it 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 8 fen, 5 hao. The new regulations are 1 yuan, 5 jiao, 1 fen, 7 hao, a difference of 2 fen, and there is no need for further reduction. Proposal No. 75 was approved after review, merging this case with Case No. 72. Proposal No. 76 was approved after review, noting that the new regulations for less-than-carload freight rates are already low and do not need to be revised. Proposal No. 77 was approved after review, finding that the Railway Bureau's current freight rates are already 3% lower than before and do not need to be reduced further. Proposal No. 78 was approved after review, noting that the Railway Bureau is currently purchasing more locomotives and there will be no problems in the future. The current freight rate for fourth-class goods is already lower than cost and cannot be reduced further. Proposal No. 79 was approved after review, merging this case with Case No. 75. Proposal No. 80 was approved after review, finding that the Railway Bureau's prices have been revised and implemented since January of this year and are already lower than before and cannot be reduced further. Proposal No. 81 was approved after review, finding that most of the freight from Songjiang is less-than-carload, which is already low. As for the cost of collecting and delivering goods, it has always been handled by the customers themselves, and the customers should directly consult with the contractor at that station to negotiate a reduction. Proposal No. 82 was approved after review, merging this case with Case No. 73. Proposal No. 83 was approved after review, noting that the new price is reduced by half compared to the old price, so it cannot be reduced further. Proposal No. 84 was approved after review, noting that there are special prices for shipping cotton yarn. Please ask the Railway Bureau to consider it after the period expires. It was also found that the Railway Bureau's labor fees for loading and unloading have slightly increased to maintain the workers' livelihood due to the rising cost of living in various places. Proposal No. 85 was approved after review, finding that the third-class passenger fare from Suzhou to Shanghai is 9 jiao per person, which is 1 fen per kilometer. This amount is only enough to cover the cost of railway transportation, so it cannot be reduced further. Proposal No. 86 was approved after review, proposing that the Railway Bureau transport oilcloth, canvas, and empty bags used for packaging silk back to the starting station free of charge. Proposal No. 87 was approved after review, merging this case with Case No. 86. According to the original proposal, all have already been reported on the 17th, and are slightly omitted due to space constraints.)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Closing Today <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The conference has not resolved 62 proposals from various groups, and there are also an estimated 40 temporary proposals. Yesterday's conference decided that all proposals listed on the agendas of the 19th and 20th should be reviewed by last night. Today, in the morning and afternoon, the discussion will continue on those not yet included in the agenda. Representatives will make temporary oral proposals and must complete the discussion all day long. The closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Drafting a Declaration: The conference decided to issue a declaration to announce to society on the day of the closing ceremony. The chairman has appointed Zheng Baozhao, Min Luobing, Li Kaihua, Guanglu, and Feng Yunchu, and Zheng Baozhao, the director of the document group, has convened a drafting meeting last night to draft a proposal for presentation to the conference today for approval and publication.</p>
<p>Review Committees of Various Groups: The review committees of various groups had as many as 102 unresolved cases, so a review committee of each group was convened at Jiande Hall at 4:30 PM yesterday after the closing of the conference at 4 PM to actively review the cases.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau's Banquet: The Railway Bureau believes that the convening of this conference has been very satisfactory and has specifically decided to hold a banquet for the representatives and experts at Xinghualou tonight. Liu Weichi, the director of both railways, has already sent letters to the representatives yesterday. To the Chairman, Respectfully, Upon investigation, the authorities are widely opening avenues of speech during this commercial conference, consulting broadly, and inquiring widely, which is truly a grand event. However, there must be too many proposals and the meeting period is too short. It is requested that after reviewing the proposals, an immediate vote should be taken. After the vote, it should be implemented immediately. For proposals that are not within the scope of railway administration and do not benefit both the railway and the merchants, they should be immediately stopped and not discussed, so that each proposal can be voted on in order and the agenda will not be prolonged. A good result can be obtained and public opinion can be satisfied. Feng Yunchu, of the Great China Transportation Company.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Silk and Satin Industry Requests Light or Exempt Taxes <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Trade Association Cables for Vigorous Advocacy</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Representatives Go to Beijing to Request Exemption</p>
<p>Municipal Silk and Satin Industry: The Municipal Silk and Satin Industry Trade Association, due to the implementation of the abolition of likin, will implement a business tax to compensate for provincial revenue. At this critical time for the silk and satin industry, the government is requested to provide relief and reduce the suffering of silk merchants. A telegram was sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Business Tax Discussion Committee, requesting them to preside over the matter, and a letter was sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Hangzhou Silk Industry Trade Association, requesting them to jointly advocate for this. The text reads: (Titles Omitted) Likin is a detrimental policy that has plagued merchants for a long time. Recently, our government has issued a clear order to abolish it, and the national industry and commerce sectors all believe that they have been freed from shackles and are rejoicing in unison. However, after the abolition of likin, a business tax must be implemented to compensate for revenue. According to reports, the tax rate for silk fabrics in the business regulations of your province is 30 per mille of the business turnover. Moreover, the Executive Yuan recently issued a general order stipulating that the outline of the business tax should not exceed 20 per mille at most. Comparing the two, they are already different. It is speculated that the intention is to regard silk fabrics as luxury goods, and therefore impose a tax exceeding the normal limit. All of our silk merchants are shocked. We believe that clothing and housing are the primary needs of human life. For clothing, cloth and silk are complementary. Exquisite clothing cannot consist entirely of cloth and exclude silk. Our country's silk cloth is like foreign woolen fabrics. Since other countries do not consider woolen fabrics as luxury goods, our country's silk fabrics should naturally be considered daily necessities and should not be listed as luxuries, first point. China is founded on agriculture, and sericulture is the primary agricultural product. Jiangsu and Zhejiang have always been known as prosperous regions because they produce excellent silk. Countless farmers, workers, and merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang rely on this for their livelihood. However, since silk from Japan and Vietnam is encroaching upon Chinese silk, our country's silk export proportion has been declining daily. The Chinese people are also increasingly fascinated by Europeanization, regarding imported silk and woolen fabrics as the supreme treasures, while turning Chinese silk into worn-out shoes. As a result, the silk industry has lost its original exit externally and is being overshadowed by imports internally, leading to a decline to a low point and near death. The Chinese people are running around calling for help, seeking to rescue it. If we were to regard it as a luxury and impose heavy taxes on it, it would only hasten its demise. This is the second point that silk fabrics should not be listed as luxuries. The silk industry has suffered from labor disputes, foreign aggression, likin exploitation, and transportation obstacles. For the sake of promoting sales, we sell at parity prices and dare not seek profit. For every 1,000 yuan of goods, excluding the cost of capital, the net profit is less than 3%. Heavy tax burdens are far beyond our ability to bear. Furthermore, the government's abolition of likin was originally intended to rescue industry and the people's livelihood. If we regard it as a luxury, it would not only contradict the original intention of abolishing likin but would also mean escaping from shackles only to be placed in a yoke. The closing of silk factories is bound to follow one after another, and the consequences are unimaginable. This is the third point that silk fabrics should not be listed as luxuries. At this critical time for the silk industry, silk merchants are looking forward to the government's tax exemption relief. Even if it is to compensate for the provincial treasury and implement a business tax, it should be reduced as much as possible to alleviate the people's suffering. We request that domestic silk be regarded as domestic woolen fabrics, and the business tax be set at 2 per mille. Then, silk merchants can fulfill their duty to contribute, and the government will not be accused of increasing the burden. Regarding all the reasons why silk fabrics should not be listed as luxuries and should be given special tax relief, we jointly cable our request to your office, asking you to sympathize with the difficulties of the merchants and grant relief to maintain the silk merchants and benefit the people's livelihood. We are deeply grateful. The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Trade Association respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry: The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Joint Association, regarding the issue of changing the tax on domestic silk to a special consumption tax, specifically convened representatives of silk industry groups from both provinces yesterday to hold a plenary session of representatives at the association. Wang Jiean was elected as chairman, and rituals were performed accordingly. The chairman announced the purpose of the meeting and described the various difficulties of the national silk industry, facing internal and external pressures and nearing death. Now that the national government is determined to abolish likin and cultivate the people's livelihood, our silk industry should seize the opportunity to discuss and resolve the painful and recuperating measures, and submit them to the national government for adoption and implementation to rescue the industry. Subsequently, Cheng Ganqing, Wang Xingyi, Wu Xingcha, Tao Shunan, and others successively expressed their opinions, and all agreed that each group should designate representatives to form a petition delegation to go to Beijing to visit the national government departments, requesting consideration for the silk industry's imminent crisis, and temporarily granting a three-year exemption from silk tax. This was unanimously approved by the entire body, and Wang Jiean was elected as the chief representative of the petition. The Wuxian Yarn and Silk Industry Association nominated Cheng Ganqing, Shi Jianqing, and Chen Guiting; the Suzhou Iron Machine Silk Weaving Association nominated Liu Fuqing and Lu Jigao; the Waiyang Silk Shop Association nominated Zhou Lianbo; the Shanghai Electric Machine Silk Weaving Association nominated Shen Tianxin and Gao Shiheng; and the Shengjing Silk Industry Office nominated Wu Xingcha and Yang Junnan. The respective representatives have already embarked on their journey to Beijing to petition for tax exemption.</p>
<h3 id="e89">New Ningxing Stranded <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Water at Taishi Reef Only Ten Feet</p>
<p>Waking Lion Tugboat Rescues New Ningxing</p>
<p>He Chengjun and Xia Douyin Delayed</p>
<p>He Chengjun, Chairman of Hubei Province, and Xia Douyin, Commander of the Wuhan Garrison, were going to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the suppression of bandits. They were traveling on the Sansui New Ningxing steamer eastward when the ship ran aground in the Anhui Province section of the Yangtze River, causing a delay for He and Xia. The report of this matter is as follows:</p>
<p>New Ningxing Stranded: The Sansui Company's Yangtze River steamer New Ningxing was returning to Shanghai from Wuhan, carrying a large amount of cargo. The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was low. When the ship reached Anqing, the river water was eleven feet deep. Upon reaching Taishi Reef near Anqing, the water was only ten feet deep. The ship, with too much draft, ran aground and was unable to move.</p>
<p>He and Xia Delayed: He Xuezhu, Chairman of Hubei Province, and Xia Douyin, Commander of the Wuhan Garrison, were summoned to Beijing by Chairman Chiang to discuss the suppression of bandits. They boarded the New Ningxing eastward. When the ship ran aground, He and Xia were extremely anxious, fearing that they would be delayed in their official duties. They ordered the shipowner to send a telegram to Shanghai and Hankou for help. After the shipowner sent a second telegram for assistance, the Hongli was sent to tug the ship.</p>
<p>Sansui Sends Tugboats: Upon receiving the report, the Sansui Shanghai office urgently telegraphed all ships in transit to go to the rescue. At that time, the upper Yangtze River steamer Hongli was first alerted and rushed from Datong to Taishi Reef to tug the ship. After three or four hours, the New Ningxing was deeply mired in the mud and was difficult to pull out. While there was no solution, the Dexing, which had launched in Hankou, received this news and immediately rushed to the scene of the accident. The Dexing tried its best to tow the New Ningxing, but it had already been stranded for a day and a half. However, the river water was too shallow and the ship was too heavily laden, so countless attempts to tow it were still ineffective. The shipowner then consulted with He Chengjun and Xia Douyin, fearing that the New Ningxing could not be freed in time and would delay official business, and requested that the two officials transfer to the Dexing to go to Beijing first. At that time, a sampan was lowered, carrying He and Xia to the Dexing. It was estimated that they would arrive in the capital last night, but they had already been delayed by two days en route.</p>
<p>Waking Lion Successfully Rescues the Ship: After the Dexing left, the company's Waking Lion was sent empty to Taishi Reef for towing. By the morning of yesterday, the river water had risen greatly. The Waking Lion used a lasso to pull the New Ningxing with force, finally freeing it. It is not yet known whether the bottom of the ship was damaged. It will be necessary to wait until the ship returns to Shanghai tomorrow and unloads its cargo before inspecting the bottom of the ship.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Zhao Tiehan Cables Request to Severely Punish the Culprits in the Zhao Case <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Request to Handle the Case Like the Chen Case</p>
<p>Zhao Tiehan's telegram to the Central Government reads: To the National Government of Nanjing, Central Party Headquarters, Executive Yuan, and Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Upon reading the news that the murderers of my late brother Zhao Tieqiao, the former special commissioner of the National Government for reorganizing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, including Xia Shaoen, have been transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial as instructed by the Executive Yuan. However, upon investigation, the court's procedures are numerous and prone to delays, which may make it difficult to uncover the truth and lead to a miscarriage of justice. When can the truth be revealed? My late brother Tieqiao followed the Premier for over twenty years, running around for the revolution, experiencing many hardships. He served the government, took over the management of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, eliminated long-standing malpractices, spared no effort, recovered aviation rights, was not afraid of violence, insisted on integrity, and did not accept money, sacrificing himself to repay the Party and the country. During the campaign to suppress Li and Bai, he worked hard on military transport and made minor contributions. Previously, he was assassinated and died in his post. We should request the government to recall his previous services and handle the case of the assassination of the late martyr Chen Yingshi, submitting the murderers Xia Shaoen and others to a special court or to the military court of the headquarters of the army, navy, and air force, to investigate the instigators and publicly pronounce the punishment. This would not only clear the name of the deceased but also ensure the protection of all officials who work hard for the government and are happy to serve. Respectfully, Zhao Tiehan kowtows. Seal.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Dispute over the Commercial Press <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Social Bureau's Mediation of the Internal Organization of the Commercial Press: Divided into four parts: General Affairs Department, Distribution Office, Translation and Compilation Office, and Printing Office. General Manager Wang Yunwu, in order to reorganize internally, stipulated: (1) "Trial Regulations for Work Remuneration Standards" for the Translation and Compilation Office, meaning that translators and compilers, who were previously paid monthly salaries, would now be paid according to the amount of work they completed. The translation and compilation work was divided into eight grades, with the lowest paid 2 yuan per thousand characters and the highest paid 6 yuan per thousand characters. (2) At the Printing Office, after the workers started work at 8:10 am, the gate would be closed, prohibiting workers from freely entering and exiting, except in the following necessary circumstances: (A) Personal illness, (B) Negligence by neighbors, (C) Serious illness of parents or spouse. (3) The attendance sheet for the letterpress printing department was revised, and a survey form was added to be compared with the attendance sheet. The employees were dissatisfied with all of the above points, and the atmosphere became increasingly tense. Subsequently, the Social Bureau summoned employee representatives for questioning last Thursday and implemented mediation the day before yesterday (the 17th). The employee union side sent eight representatives in total, including Chen Yuesheng and Wan Pusheng from the General Affairs Department, Zhu Gongchui and Feng Yixian from the Translation and Compilation Office, Wang Yongliang and Shen Shifang from the Distribution Office, and Yang Youren and Wang Changyuan from the Printing Office. Among the eight representatives, Wang Changyuan and Chen Yuesheng were appointed as the chief representatives. Xu Zhi, a staff member of the Third Section of the Social Bureau, mediated the dispute. The results were: (1) The Printing Office's practice of closing the factory gate on time to prevent theft was deemed legitimate. However, the employees could propose reasonable conditions to alleviate the difficulties. The representatives then proposed five conditions: (A) Employees requesting leave to leave the factory during work hours would not be limited to the existing conditions (i.e., the original three conditions). (B) A reception room would be set up for relatives and friends to visit, and the inspector would notify them for a meeting. (C) The armed police at the factory gate should not interfere with the employees; if intervention is necessary, it should be handled by the inspector. (D) Employees who come to the factory for medical treatment should be allowed to enter and not be hindered. (E) There would be no time limit for employees to request leave. The company agreed to accept the above five conditions. (2) The two sides held opposing views on the trial implementation of the new work remuneration standard for the Translation and Compilation Office, and mediation was unsuccessful. It was decided that mediation would be conducted again today (the 20th). If mediation fails today, the matter will be submitted to arbitration. (3) The attendance sheet for the letterpress printing department was revised, and a survey form was added, but the old regulations will be temporarily followed. The General Affairs, Translation and Compilation, Distribution, and Printing Offices held an emergency joint meeting of representatives from 2:00 pm to 4:30 pm yesterday afternoon, deciding to send four representatives to attend the Social Bureau's mediation today, and to issue a declaration in the Translation and Compilation Office, with the other three offices issuing declarations of support simultaneously, and then the four offices issuing a joint declaration.</p>
<p>The Employee Union's Reception: The employee union of the Translation and Compilation Office of the Commercial Press hosted guests from all walks of life at Yizhixiang Restaurant last night at 7:00 pm. Chairman Chen Yuesheng reported on the new work remuneration standard regulations issued by Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press. The regulations stipulate the practice of calculating wages by day and by word for translation and compilation work, which not only disregards the personality of translators and compilers but also has a significant impact on the progress of Chinese culture. The colleagues have now publicly decided to fundamentally deny it and hope that all sectors will provide assistance. Next, Zhou Yutong explained the various malpractices of the standard regulations. Next, Wu Zhihui, a guest speaker, criticized the impropriety of paying by the word. Next, Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Social Bureau, reported on the mediation process. Next, Zhu Yinqing, Chen Tingrui, Hou Dachun, Xie Fusheng, and Kuang Fuzhuo, guests, spoke successively, all expressing dissatisfaction with the standard regulations and hoping that the Social Bureau would mediate properly so that the turmoil would not spread. Finally, the chairman expressed his thanks, and the meeting adjourned at 10:00 pm.</p>

<p>The Phoenix biplane of Messageries Maritimes, located at No. 12 the Bund, was originally scheduled to fly to Little Luzon tomorrow morning at 8:00 am, piloted by Birofeu. However, due to the seven-hour flight over the sea between Shanghai and Little Luzon, and because the aircraft is a land-based aircraft, two 50-gallon fuel tanks must be added to carry extra gasoline for the sea flight and avoid the danger of landing halfway. The fuel tanks have not yet been completely installed. Therefore, the flight to Little Luzon has been changed to Thursday morning at 8:00 am, still departing from the Hongqiao Airport, first to Fuzhou overnight, then flying to Guangzhou the next day, and then flying to Little Luzon. Messageries Maritimes has also contacted the post office to have the aircraft carry mail.

He has two sons, A-da, 34 years old, and A-zhang, 31 years old, both of whom are married. They have separated from the family and started their own businesses. However, A-zhang is addicted to opium and does not work, so his life is very difficult. As the Lunar New Year is approaching, debts are being demanded, and his finances are tight. Last night, he asked his father for the land deed so that he could mortgage it to pay off his debts. His father refused, and they had an argument. His father became very angry and grabbed a gun from the security team and fired a shot, which hit A-zhang's right leg. The bullet pierced the leg, and the bone was broken.

<p>Tao Haiyuan Cries for Help But Cannot Speak</p>
<p>Tao Haiyuan, a 64-year-old native of Nanhui, specializes in transporting cotton clothing. The cotton brought by the farmers from various villages in Pudong is all handled by Tao for sale to various cotton shops. He handles several thousand yuan in transactions every day. Tao has established an office at No. 15 Hushu Li, Limalu, Gongyi Wharf. Although Tao is over sixty, he is very diligent and thrifty and personally goes to the office every day to handle matters. His son, Tonghai, 38 years old, also assists his father in all matters at the office. Yesterday afternoon, at around 3:00 pm, Tao, his son, Tonghai, and a boatman, Tang Xuehai, were settling accounts at the office when three robbers suddenly appeared. They were all wearing long robes and speaking in a local accent. After entering the room, they all brandished handguns and drove Tao and the others to a corner, forbidding them to make any noise. One of the robbers immediately took the 2,300 yuan in cash and silver dollars on the account table (mostly Siming Bank notes) and put them in his pocket. Just as they were about to flee with the stolen goods, Tao Haiyuan realized that he was being robbed and shouted for help. But the words "save me" had just come out, and the word "life" had not yet been spoken. The merciless bullet had already been fired from the handgun held by one of the robbers, hitting Tao's left abdomen. He immediately fell to the ground, injured and bleeding. Seeing that they had caused a catastrophe, the robbers immediately rushed out the door, firing another shot at the house as they left. The bullet grazed Tang Xuehai, fortunately without causing any injury. At that time, the neighbors in the neighborhood suddenly heard the sound of gunfire and all opened their doors to look. They saw three men running out of house No. 15, saying that there was a fight inside and that there was nothing to see. They then left the alley and disappeared without a trace. Only after the neighbors entered house No. 15 did they realize that a huge sum of money had been robbed and that someone had been shot. Tao's son, Tonghai, and the boatman, Tang Xuehai, seeing that the robbers had gone far away, were slightly calmer. They found Tao Haiyuan lying on the ground, barely alive. They immediately took him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. According to the hospital, the shot hit a vital organ and his life may be in danger.</p>

<p>His Head Can Be Cut Off and Used as a Chamber Pot</p>
<p>Sun Dunwang, a 31-year-old native of Taizhou, lives on Suzhou Road in northern Shanghai and works as a shop assistant for a Japanese company. His wife, Chen, is not bad-looking and is the same age as Sun. Sun has a friend named Huang Lao San, who is now 31 years old. He often visits Sun's house, and Sun treats him kindly, allowing him to enter and leave the house freely without any restraint. Huang, however, is a beast in human clothing. He sees that Chen is beautiful and forgets Sun's friendship. He actually tries to seduce her. Over time, Chen falls under his spell, and they have an illicit affair. Because of Sun, they cannot do as they please. Therefore, on the 17th of this month, they eloped and hid in the Kade Road area in western Shanghai, planning to flee to the countryside. After his wife disappeared, Sun suspected that Huang had seduced her because no one else had visited his house. Therefore, at around 10:00 pm the day before yesterday, he went to Huang's place to inquire. Huang said, "You and I are close friends, how could I abduct your wife?" He then said, "If you find out that I abducted your wife in the future, you can cut off my head and use it as a chamber pot." Sun left after hearing this, but he still lurked nearby, watching his movements. Huang, seeing that Sun had left, knew that the news was tight. He quickly took Chen out of the house. Sun saw them by chance and followed them secretly. When they reached the Guan Bridge in Nanshi, they were about to board a ship. Sun immediately reported to the police of the Third Precinct, who came forward and arrested the man and woman and took them back to the First District Headquarters. After a preliminary hearing, they were ordered to be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation.</p>

<p>Friends Organize a Funeral Committee</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Chujiu lived in Shanghai for forty years and engaged in various businesses, all of which were very successful. He was especially happy to donate to public welfare and charitable causes and was courageous in doing what was right. In the autumn and winter of last year, he suffered from severe asthma due to overwork, but he soon recovered. At the beginning of December, he went to Hangzhou to rest and stayed for more than a month. He returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou on January 2nd of this year. The fatigue in the car, coupled with more than a month of backlog of affairs in Shanghai, led to his diligent management and the recurrence of his old illness. He passed away at 4:10 pm yesterday (the 19th). The funeral will be held on the 21st (Wednesday). Mr. Huang founded many businesses during his lifetime. When he was ill, he left a will, entrusting his close friends to handle various funeral matters. After Mr. Huang passed away yesterday, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, Ye Shantao, Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhao Qinbo, and others, held a meeting that night to organize a funeral committee. The members were generally appointed. Except for the Day and Night Bank and the sightseeing deposit department, which were temporarily entrusted to accountant Xu Yongzuo for sorting out, the rest remained the same. The detailed measures will be fully decided today. The following is a brief biography of Mr. Huang.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Chujiu's Portrait</p>
<p>Mr. Huang, a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, was originally named Chenggang, courtesy name Chujiu, later known by his courtesy name, and then changed his name to Cuojiu. He was a descendant of Mr. Lizhou, a great Confucian scholar of the late Ming Dynasty. His father, the elderly Zhiyi, was skilled in ophthalmology and was taught by an extraordinary person. He was especially known as a miracle worker. Mr. Huang followed his profession at a young age and read medical books extensively. He believed that Chinese medicine lacked the brain and organs, and the meaning was incomplete. Therefore, he resolutely gave up and devoted himself to the study of Western medicine. He founded the Zhongfa Pharmacy, and later also operated the Sino-Western Pharmacy. He also founded the Jiufu Company and issued dozens of beneficial medicines. In addition, he founded businesses such as the Great World, the Day and Night Bank, and the Fuchang Tobacco Company. There are countless other smaller ones. Mr. Huang also served as an executive member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, chairman of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, a member of the West Lake Exposition Committee, and an economic member of the Red Cross Society. In the eighth year of the Republic, there was a major disaster in Henan, and people exchanged children for food. Mr. Huang sent people with funds to adopt more than a thousand infants. In the summer of the fifteenth year of the Republic, there was a major epidemic in Shanghai, and the dead were piled up. The existing epidemic hospital could not provide enough treatment. Mr. Huang resolutely initiated the epidemic hospital, which was completed in just ten days, saving many lives. He also independently built an ophthalmology hospital on Longmen Road, providing diagnosis and treatment at his own expense, without seeking donations. Mr. Huang's generosity is a model for the world.</p>

During the banquet, Li Guoneng, the Director of General Affairs, stood up and gave a speech, saying that the society had been established for exactly one year since its founding last year. In the past year, the society has not developed much due to the small number of members and their separation in various ports. However, the English-Chinese Automotive Terminology Record compiled will be published soon. He then reported on the new staff members for this year: Li Guoneng as Director of General Affairs, Wu Qufei as Secretary, and Ding Zuze as Accountant. It was also agreed that the first standing meeting would be held at 2:00 pm on February 1st at Room 303, Jin Xing House, at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Hong Kong Road.

<h3 id="e108">Establishment of the China Cartoon News Agency <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the need for cartoons in Chinese publications has been increasing. However, there is still no suitable supply group. Now, the satirical cartoonist Mr. Huang Wennong, in view of the above-mentioned regret, resolutely founded the China Cartoon News Agency, gathering famous cartoonists to contribute their works to newspapers and magazines across the country as a war effort. Mr. Huang examined the situation in the international publishing industry and recognized that newspapers and magazines must use cartoons as a necessary condition to be successful publications of an era. The needs of readers of the era take cartoons as the driving force for promoting their thoughts. Because the power of cartoons lies in making up for the deficiencies of life and arousing the resonance of the public. Newspapers and magazines should publish cartoons based on the standpoint of freedom of speech in order to stimulate the spirit of the nation. Now, because Mr. Huang still has a part of his affairs that he cannot resign from, the agency is temporarily located at No. 2786 Anle Li, Zhoujiazui Road, this city. Send four cents in postage for the articles of association. The following is a warning within its articles of association: Newspapers and magazines that have a considerable history of publication and do not want to be outdated, please quickly add cartoons. Newspapers and magazines that are newly published and want to win a leading position in the public opinion, please quickly add cartoons. Newspapers and magazines are the mouthpiece of the people. If you want to achieve their true wishes, you must use cartoons. If you want to keep pace with the international publishing industry and win glory, you must use cartoons.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Iron Factory Worker Crushing Tragedy - One Dead, Four Injured - At the Wantai Iron Factory on Youheng Road, east of Tilanqiao, around 1:30 AM this morning, a worker was working on a wooden frame in the factory when suddenly a wooden beam struck him, knocking him down. At the time, more than a dozen workers were working below, resulting in five people being crushed. They were immediately taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. One person died upon arrival at the hospital due to severe injuries. Weather Report - The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: The weather in the Yangtze River basin is sunny and mild, with fog in the morning. There is a cyclone in northern Korea. The northwest wind along the Shandong coast is strengthening. The wind along the Chinese coast is variable. There is a low-pressure area in Hunan. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 55.2 degrees, and the lowest was 25.7 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 38.3 degrees, and the lowest was 30.2 degrees. Letter to the Editor - To the Esteemed Editor, I am writing in response to a news item published on page 4 of your esteemed newspaper on the 17th regarding the China Merchants Inland Steam Navigation Bureau, which does not align with the facts and should be corrected to avoid misunderstandings. Since the Zhejiang Provincial Government took over this bureau in June of last year, and in order to unify accounting and supervise finances, the accounting director has been directly appointed by the provincial government, which has been very effective. The personnel dispatched only include two individuals from the Hangzhou General Bureau and the Shanghai Office, with a monthly salary of no more than one hundred yuan, which amounts to just over a thousand yuan annually. It is definitely not the case, as your newspaper stated, that the accounting staff dispatched by the provincial government receive a monthly salary of over ten thousand yuan. Furthermore, the business profit and loss rely on the enthusiasm of the managers and the planning to reform the long-standing malpractices. The salary is small, and business losses have no significant relationship with it. Therefore, I am writing this letter to clarify and hope you will publish the correction. With best wishes, Shanghai Office of the China Merchants Inland Steam Navigation Bureau, 18th. - Sir, Having read a news article in your local news section of the 17th of your newspaper, regarding the assassination of the head of the Xinchang defense forces in Shanghai, the name, age, origin and reasons to come to Shanghai are all accurate. However, the title "head" is thought to be a mistake. Our unit's current head is Branch Chief Jiang from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the post currently held by Zhang Jun Ren Bai. The murdered Ni Jian was our unit's drillmaster and not the head. We fear that the misinformation can confuse listeners. Therefore, we ask that a correction be printed, to set the matter straight. Wishing you peace, Xinchang Special Defense Force Headquarters, 20·1·17.

Lao Dong University President Sworn into Office - Wu Zhihui and Wang Zhengting Both Sent Congratulatory Telegrams - Dr. Wang Jingqi, the new president of National Labor University, held a swearing-in ceremony at the school's auditorium in Jiangwan at 10:00 AM yesterday, which was very grand. The details of the event are as follows: - Venue Arrangement: The school auditorium faces Jiangwan Avenue. Arriving by public bus in the morning, the Party and National flags could be seen from afar, flying high and swaying in the wind, creating a new atmosphere. Inside the auditorium, a banner with the red characters "President Wang's Inauguration Swearing-in Ceremony" was hung on the stage, with shorthand seats on the left and right. The front of the stage was covered with seasonal flowers, solemn and splendid. The front of the hall was the guest seating area, followed by the faculty seating area, and then the student seating area. - Attendees: The weather was clear and mild yesterday, and guests attended enthusiastically. The attendees included Hu Shuhua, the president of Tongji University representing the Ministry of Education; Mayor Zhang Yuejun; Cen Dezhang and Zheng Yuan, representatives from the Municipal Education Bureau; Chu Minyi, the founder of Lao Dong University; as well as Cai Guojingluan, Guo Jinglun, Li Baike, Huang Wanlin, Shi Wu Shan, President Li of Jiaotong University, Liu Jiwen (represented by Xu, Kang Xuanyi, etc., and more than a thousand teachers and students, making it a grand occasion. - Chairman's Address: Chairman Chu Minyi gave the opening address, stating that he was very pleased to be appointed as chairman as a member of the preparatory committee. The preparatory committee also included Mr. Cai, Li, and Wu, but they were unable to attend due to other engagements. Lao Dong University has been established for three years and has experienced many twists and turns. It is not easy to have President Wang take on this arduous task. After today's solemn swearing-in ceremony, it is hoped that President Wang will strive in the labor sector and ensure that Chinese education truly achieves laborization. - President's Oath: President Wang took the oath facing the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the Party and National flags, raising his right hand and reading the oath (as reported in yesterday's newspaper, details omitted). - Supervisory Remarks: Hu Shuhua, the representative of the Ministry of Education, made the supervisory remarks, stating that he received the order from the Ministry the day before yesterday to represent them, but the Ministry's remarks have not yet arrived. Today, he can only offer congratulations. President Wang has moral character and academic qualifications. He was stationed in Belgium for many years in the diplomatic field. Belgium is the origin of labor education, so President Wang will surely develop this school. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a respect education and encourage agriculture article on New Year's Day, indicating that the government pays more attention to labor education. However, the improvement of the school requires the cooperation of teachers and students. I hope that everyone (1) understands the special position they are in, (2) should lead the national education to exceed the laborization (3) turn disappointment into hope and turn pessimism into optimism. Finally, I hope that teachers and students will work together with affection and sincerity to help President Wang develop Lao Dong University. I also hope that President Wang will uphold Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of "the world is for all," be dedicated to his duties, and diligently develop Lao Dong University and Chinese labor education. - Mayor Zhang's Address: Lao Dong University is the first university founded after the establishment of the National Government and is a product of the National Revolution. In other words, it is an agency for implementing labor education after the establishment of the National Government. The relationship between Lao Dong University and the Party is extremely close and important. It is hoped that (1) past mistakes will be corrected and efforts will be made from now on, and (2) education will be doctrine and adapted to the needs of the times to achieve the purpose of saving the country through education. - There were also guests Huang Wan and Huang Huilong. The lengths of their speeches are omitted. - President Wang's Response: President Wang's response was extremely sincere and detailed. He extracted the main points, stating that Jingqi used to travel in diplomacy. This time, the Central Government ordered him to serve at Lao Dong University. Today, he solemnly took office, and he is honored and grateful for everyone's earnest encouragement. At the same time, he feels a great responsibility and will not be afraid of difficulties or complacency. He will respectfully do his job. The Central Government attaches great importance to labor education and is particularly concerned about Lao Dong University. The last time the highest authorities came to observe can prove this. Jingqi only hopes that all teachers and students will work together in the future, and that people from all walks of life will give more support and hope, so that this unprecedented business will have a successful success. In our country's recent bleak history of education, add a brilliant glory. The principles suspended by Lao Dong University are: first, the labor of education, and second, the education of labor, and the social is just two diseases, one is the educator is full of success, the education of the labor, and the social is two diseases, no labor, and second, the laborer has no education. If you want to save this crisis, you should make labor and mind into one piece, plan and take care of both. In the future, our school will not only be determined to rectify the teaching affairs, but also need to expand the farm, expand the factory, and no matter what the agriculture, industry and society students study, they must actually work and directly contact with the workers and peasants, in order to create a diligent and pragmatic study style, and to promote the inherent morality of this country with the skills of foreign countries, as a model for the whole people. Furthermore, Jingqi knows that education is a century-old plan and is responsible for building a new China, so the planning and equipment should be planned from afar, and when the country's finances are difficult, it is especially necessary to save expenses, cherish material resources, and work together to develop. - A Glimpse of Congratulatory Telegrams: (1) To President Wang of Lao Dong University, Sir, your appointment is a difficult one, and Lao Dong University will surely reach perfection. I cannot help but rejoice. Important matters are delayed, and I am sorry for not being able to attend the grand ceremony. Sincerely, Wu Jingheng. (2) I have received and understood your letter. You have been ordered to head the school and have taken office last year. At a time when education is being rectified, you have the talent to be a pillar in the stream. You will soon see the trees planted by the wind and the songs of the trees, which will be a celebration for your school and a celebration for the country. Wang Zhengting. (3) Chen Shiguang, director of the Foreign Ministry's Shanghai office, and Huang Boqiao, director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, both sent congratulatory letters (omitted).

The plan to go to Europe was later suspended due to various reasons. The executive committee of the Shanghai Western Soccer League had planned to form another committee to study the activities and status of the players and report to the executive committee. Later, the committee's organization encountered difficulties, and the Chinese National Sports Federation decided not to send representatives to attend. After the committee members were finalized and agreed upon, one member recently resigned for reasons fully endorsed by the executive committee. However, since this matter has been delayed for a long time, reorganizing the committee would further delay the matter. Therefore, the executive committee decided to conduct its own thorough and final review and, after careful study and consideration of all relevant facts, decided as follows: The players' departure for the competition without the prior consent of the Shanghai Western Soccer League was a violation of the league's regulations. However, the violation may have been due to unfamiliarity with the regulations rather than intentional disregard. The team manager, the liaison in Shanghai, and the representative in England were also in violation of these regulations. Furthermore, the players have undoubtedly violated the amateur sports rules of the English Football Association. However, the violation was likely due to unfamiliarity with the rules, and the team manager was also in violation of these rules. In view of this special situation, the council decided to issue a reprimand to all those involved in the team who are active in the various competitions under the protection of this council. If they wish to participate in the ball games hosted by the council in the future, they must abide by the regulations of the Shanghai Western Soccer League and the amateur sports rules of the English Football Association, otherwise, they will be permanently expelled from all amateur ball games related to this council. The Northeast Basketball Team Crushes Qingguang Last Night - Talented, Balanced, Excellent Offense and Defense, Perfect Performance - A Score of 50 to 20 - The Northeast University basketball team, which dominates North China and outside the Shanhaiguan Pass, has achieved great success since coming to Shanghai. After its initial victory over Hujiang, it took advantage of its victory last night and crushed Qingguang at the Chinese Basketball Hall. The score at halftime was 25 to 10, and the final score was 50 to 20. Referee Xu Zhenche recorded it as follows: Overview of the Northeast Team: Northern basketball talents are naturally gifted. The Northeast generals are all tall and strong, especially Yu Shi, so the passing, shooting, and jumping of Qingguang are beyond the reach. The average talent is the key to the victory of the Northeast. Zhao Lingzhi's center is outstanding, and Yuan Tingrui's basket is like wearing Yang. In addition to Chang Ma Bingjun's right guard, it is very stable and defensive. Looking at the whole team, it can be called a strong team. Small Knowledge of the Two Teams' Strategies: The Northeast attack is not only accurate in throwing the basket, but also often able to get out of it quickly and avoid the enemy. It is also practiced, and the high-altitude throwing is always used by the tall figure, making Qingguang look up. The retreat is good at using five-person joint defense, making the enemy hesitate and unable to enter. This is the outline of its battle. Looking back at Qingguang, there was very little contact in the first half, and I only saw chasing around. In the second half, I once changed to individual anti-strike warfare and saw progress. The emptiness of the guards is the main reason for the failure. In short, it may also be the bad luck. The Northeast Strikes in One Breath: The whistle blows to start the game. After a few rounds of maneuvering, the Northeast Yuan Tingrui took advantage of the enemy's lack of defense and scored in the basket with a blood hand. Tian Xinyuan, the magistrate of Fengzuo Central Laiqiu, entered the basket with his hand. The record was first opened, and Tian Xinyuan took advantage of Fengzuo's foul and hit the free throw. The Northeast got seven points at once. Qingguang requested a short break in order to kill the enemy's power. Sure enough, Tan Da threw a ball with his backhand, but the Northeast went up again. Qingguang Saw a Slight Improvement: After 7-2, the Northeast did not decline slightly, and the two fronts joined forces to create a number of 12-2. Then, the Northeast fouled continuously, and Qingguang made all the free throws, which became 12-4. Qingguang Fang saw an improvement in the Northeastern Yuan Tingrui's ball, and the beads flew into the net one after another. The first half became 25-10, and the Northeast took the lead. Qingguang Made Four Free Throws and Four Hits: Continued combat, the Northeast Ma Bingjun unexpectedly invested in the basket on the left. The two fronts of Fan Zhao followed, and the formation was 31 to 10. At this time, the Northeast suddenly prevented the enemy from being too strict and fouled one after another. Tan Da made four consecutive free throws. It was not easy to make four free throws. Da Wei Zhong and Qingguang suddenly increased by six points. Hope is still there. The Northeast Is Like a Broken Bamboo: How can you know that it is an instant, the Northeast number is added to the number, and the loss is getting farther and farther. Tian Xinyuan came out to rest. Yang Zhongxiu replaced him and was also good. The two fronts of Yuan Zhao entered the realm of no entry, and the score suddenly became 44 to 16. And Mo Mingquan Lu Dazhen entered, and the situation was not saved. The result was 50-20, which was twice as much as in the first half. Mr. Hao Gengsheng Arrives in Shanghai: Hao Gengsheng, the director of physical education at Northeast University, also came to Shanghai. He watched the game last night, and the Northeast battle has gained another guide. The battle records of the two teams last night are listed below. Name and position of the Northeast University team: Shooting Free Throw Foul Score Right Forward Fan Tingrui 10 balls 2 times 1 time 22 Left Forward Tian Xinyuan 1 ball 3 times 0 times 5 points Left Forward Yang Zhongxiu 1 ball 0 times 0 times 2 points Center Zhao Lingzhi 7 balls 2 times 2 times 16 Right Guard Ma Bingjun 2 balls 1 time 1 time 5 points Left Guard Pang Ying 0 balls 0 times 0 times 0 points Total: 21 8 times 7 times 50 Qingguang Basketball Team: Right Forward Tan Datie 3 balls 5 times 1 time 11 Left Forward Lu Hualuo 0 balls 0 times 0 times 0 points Left Forward Lu Dazhen 0 balls 0 times 0 times 0 points Center Yu Tianqing 2 balls 1 time 3 times 5 points Center Mo Mingquan 1 ball 0 times 0 times 2 points Right Guard Zhang Jinxiang 1 ball 0 times 1 time 2 points Left Guard Feng Zuo 0 balls 0 times 4 times 0 points Left Guard Fang Junming 0 balls 0 times 0 times 0 points Total: 7 balls 6 times 11 20 points First Half: Northeast 25 points Qingguang 10 points Second Half: Northeast 25 points Qingguang 10 points</p>

<p>The Smile of Xi Lin 105 - A Guest from Shanghai - Principal: (Receives a phone call. Says into the phone) Hello? Who is this? Caller: Who are you? Principal: (Recognizes the voice as his ten-year-old beloved son. Plays along) You want to know who I am? I'm the best person in the world. Caller: Sorry, wrong number. Wife: I've been improving my singing lately. Would you like to hear me sing a song? Husband: Sure, I'll listen to you sing a song. Wife: My voice is great. (Starts singing loudly) Husband: Wait, wait. (Quickly closes the windows and doors) Wife: (Stops singing) Why did you close all the windows and doors? Husband: I'm afraid the neighbors will misunderstand and think I'm beating you up. Father: (Gives a novel to his son) Son, you can read this book in your spare time. Because it's an excellent novel. Son: Oh, Father. I already read this book in the school library. Father: After reading it, what did you think? Can you give me a conclusion? Son: The ending was too tragic. I didn't like it. Father: The ending of the book is clearly happy. How can you say it's tragic? Son: Don't you see that the protagonist in the book abandoned his lover and went home to his wife? Isn't that too tragic? Feng Hao Sou and Frozen Tofu - Zheng Yimei - Since the beginning of the year, the weather has been freezing. Icicles hang from the eaves, reaching a foot in length. My family bought frozen tofu and cooked it with pork to accompany wine. It had a unique flavor. A guest who was acquainted with the late poet Feng Hao Sou said that Hao Sou loved to eat frozen tofu and drink wine to ward off the cold. He couldn't do without frozen tofu. He once composed a long poem about frozen tofu, but unfortunately, the manuscript was lost and never recovered. Otherwise, it could be passed down along with Yuan Mei's record of pig's head. In the summer, after eating plums and watermelon, he would definitely serve frozen tofu. But because it was hot, tofu couldn't be frozen, so he would store it in advance in the winter. The method was to take the frozen tofu and expose it to the sun. After it thawed into water and dried, the tofu became as hard as iron. Then, he would store it in a jar, sealing it tightly to prevent it from spoiling for a long time. In the summer, he would take it out of the jar and cook it, and it would be incomparably refreshing. Hao Sou would eat it with relish and it would improve his appetite. Hao Sou was good at calligraphy. He once said that there were six suitable conditions for practicing calligraphy: a clear breeze in the summer morning, a warm sun in the winter afternoon, after enjoying tea, after a light drink, a clever maid holding the inkstone, and a bright boy burning incense. Only a talented person could make such a wonderful statement. Hao Sou was fond of humor. He once had a long conversation with a guest. It was late in the year and the weather was cold. It looked like it would snow in the evening. Hao Sou invited the guest to drink at night. When they were drunk, Hao Sou said, "The ancients said that the three friends of winter are pine, bamboo, and plum. Then I have a long-standing relationship with the three friends." The guest asked him about it. He said, "Today, I'm using pine mushrooms and tofu to accompany bamboo leaf wine, and you are named Plum Creek. That is also the three friends." The guest smiled. They continued to drink. They didn't know that the snow outside the door was so deep that it had covered the horse's hooves. Wan Sou. Hao Sou was from Jintan. His name was Meng Hua. He had been a recluse in Shanghai for many years. He was one of the remnants of the past dynasty. Wind, Cold, and Moon Illuminate the Three Fragrant Graves - Ma Xiezong - Shanghai Cemetery is one of the four major cemeteries in Shanghai. It is located east of the Jiangwan Racecourse, in the Yin'hang Township. It is about seven or eight li from Jiangwan Town. The cemetery covers an area of about 200 mu and was founded by a wealthy merchant from Zhenhai. It was completed in the winter of the 17th year of the Republic (1928). This place is quiet and there are few cars. If the sun is shining and the wind is gentle, looking around makes one feel open-minded. However, on rainy days, wandering around can't help but bring a feeling of sadness. The cemetery is full of new tombs and steles, all of which have been built recently. In the western corner, there is the grave of Miss Shuxian, the daughter of Yu Youren, the director of the Control Yuan of the National Government. Slightly to the north, there is the grave of Miss Weiping, the daughter of Hu Pu'an, the director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department. Before their deaths, the two ladies once studied at the Chengdong Girls' School in Shanghai. Miss Yu was skilled in calligraphy, deeply rooted in family studies. Miss Hu was also skilled in calligraphy and painting. Her calligraphy was modeled after Zhao Huishu, and her paintings were copied from Huang Shiggu. After Miss Yu returned to Shaanxi with her father, the two were separated. From then on, they were at opposite ends of the earth, and their longing for each other increased. But human affairs are impermanent, and ephemeral mushrooms wither easily. Therefore, in less than a few years, the two ladies passed away one after another, which is very sad. Now, the two ladies are buried in the same cemetery, with their fragrant graves next to each other. It may not be a coincidence. If they knew in the afterlife, their friendship would be even greater than when they were alive. And in the wind and rain, at dawn and dusk, their souls would have companions, so they would not be lonely and miserable. Also in the cemetery, there is another tomb, with the inscription "Grave of Beloved Daughters Nana and Tingting". The names are very beautiful. It is unknown whose daughters are buried here. After paying respects, it is even more sad. Cheng Zai Yanqiu's Prayer for Peace Is Careful - Cheng Yanqiu's newly written play "Tears on the Barren Mountain," also called "Prayer for Peace," has been completed. The description is as follows: This play is based on a story from the Ming Dynasty. It tells the story of Gao Liangmin, a hunter in Jiyuan County, his wife Chen, his son Zhong, his daughter-in-law Zhang Huizhu, and his grandson Baolian. Although their circumstances are poor, their family is harmonious and they enjoy the joys of family life. Because Yang Sichang believed that the military expenses were insufficient, he advocated the levy of military rations and training rations, and then requested an increase in taxes. At that time, the yamen runners ran rampant, and the people complained. Gao Liangmin and his son were trapped in paying taxes. They struggled to hunt, but both were killed by tigers. His grandson Baolian was captured by the government army and became a soldier. Chen was so grieved that she vomited blood and died. The only one left was Zhang Huizhu, who was alone and miserable. The plot is very simple, but the details are carefully crafted. Cheng Yanqiu plays Zhang Huizhu. At first, she used her hard-earned weaving to pay taxes, but then she suffered repeated family tragedies and had to support herself alone. Finally, she was forced by evil runners and had no way out. She lamented that she had suffered from war and chaos. She lamented her life and sympathized with the people. So, she fled to the barren valley and cried out to heaven. She expressed her deep compassion and prayed for peace. She was willing to die for the people. This is the focus of the entire play. In the scene of waiting for her husband on a moonlit night, she sings "Nanbangzi". Her surprise, suspicion, and fear become more and more intense. In the scene of seeing her husband in the air, she sings "Kuaiban". Her resentment and madness are like being drunk. She portrays the situation vividly and realistically. In the final scene, she uses "Yaoban" to make a desolate cry. The world is old and the sky is barren, and her blood is dry and her tears are exhausted.

<h3 id="e111">Over Two Hundred Fishing Boats Burned by Pirates <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Naval Gunboats Head to Suppress</p>
<p>Recently, outside of Wu Song Port and along the coastal areas of various counties such as Tongzhou, Rugao, Hai'an, and Qidong, large groups of pirate ships, numbering over a hundred, have reappeared, traveling to and from the sea and various ports, burning and looting extensively with extreme ferocity. The fishing boats along the coast, as the autumn fishing season has ended, are currently gathered in ports along the coast to rest for the winter, engaged in repairing nets in preparation for setting sail in the spring. They have all been surrounded by pirate ships, which coerce the fishing households to pay protection money, ranging from fifty to five hundred yuan depending on the size of the fishing boat, divided into ten grades. (It is said that after the fishing boats pay the money to the pirates, the pirates give them a yellow flag with the pirate's seal on it as a mark. Afterwards, when the fishing boats set sail, they raise the yellow flag on the ship's mast, and the pirates will not rob them, beautifully calling it protection money.) If the fishing boats do not comply, they are set on fire by the pirates. As a result, according to the survey results, over two hundred fishing boats have been burned by pirates in recent days. Those that have not been reported are not included. The fishing boats are quite panicked. Xu Mianqin, the captain of the 17th squad of the 4th district of the Wu Song Naval Police, and Lin Junsheng, the captain of the 18th squad, after receiving the report the day before yesterday, have already led the Hai Ping, Yang Duan, Hai Deng gunboats and two squads of patrol boats to sail to the coastal area to suppress them.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Xu Lichih Invents Locust-Exterminating Paste <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The loss to our country's agricultural production due to locust plagues amounts to hundreds of millions every year. However, the methods of controlling locusts still follow the old methods of driving, capturing, and burying, etc. There has never been a fundamental extermination using scientific methods with medicine. Xu Lichih of Beiping, who has long been dedicated to horticulture, invented a locust-exterminating paste last year, made entirely from domestic raw materials. One tael of the paste can be mixed with water at a ratio of 800 to 1200 times. After mixing with water, it is sprayed into the fields with a sprayer. Areas already afflicted with locusts can be instantly paralyzed, or they will smell the scent and fly away, not daring to land. The paste not only exterminates locusts, but also drives away all pests that harm crops, without harming crops, livestock, or humans. Its value is extremely low, and its protection is extremely high. In the future, after it is launched, it will greatly benefit the agricultural and horticultural communities. He is currently applying to the Ministry of Industry for registration and patent, and ordering all provincial agricultural departments to instruct rural villages to purchase it. He also intends to seek cooperation from domestic capitalists to establish a large-scale factory to manufacture and launch it.</p>
<h3 id="e113">100,000 Yuan Smuggled Aboard New Beijing Steamer Last Night <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Banks Transport Funds to Ningbo for Profit</p>
<p>Detention, Assessment of Fines to be Discussed</p>
<p>Recently, Ningbo has been lacking in cash, and silver dollars have soared in value. Banks in this city are transporting cash to Ningbo to profit from this. Yesterday, someone attempted to smuggle a large sum of money, hoping to evade taxes. Customs officers discovered 100,000 yuan on the New Beijing steamer and immediately requested a fine. The following is a report of what was heard.</p>
<p>One Hundred Thousand Yuan Secretly Transported Recently, cash in the Ningbo market has been extremely tight, and exchange rates have skyrocketed. Bank staff see this as a great source of profit and are collecting cash to send to Ningbo. In a single transfer, they can earn huge profits. This cash is transported to Ningbo by sea, which is a short distance, requiring only one night. Therefore, they often entrust it to steamer crew members, giving them a small reward to avoid the hassle of customs declarations and evade customs duties. Yesterday, a certain bank, etc., divided 100,000 national currency into twenty boxes to be transported to Ningbo. They had contacted the crew of the Taikoo New Beijing steamer in advance and secretly loaded it into the ship to be unloaded in Ningbo. It was already loaded by 5:00 PM, and after the passengers were all on board, the ship set sail.</p>
<p>Discovered by Customs Officers The Customs Patrol Department, which inspects ships departing the port, must check for contraband and smuggled goods. The customs officers searched the forward hold crew quarters and discovered a large amount of cash that had not been declared, clearly indicating that it was being smuggled. They immediately notified the ship's captain to temporarily delay the ship's departure and reported it to the customs office, who detained the cash.</p>
<p>Sending a Steamer to Extract the Cash The Jianghai Customs received the report and immediately dispatched a small steamer to the Taikoo Wharf. Under the supervision of the customs officers, the 100,000 yuan was removed from the crew quarters and loaded onto the small steamer, which transported it back to the customs warehouse for safekeeping, pending investigation of the banks involved and assessment of fines according to smuggling regulations. The cash was not completely unloaded and removed until 7:00 PM. The New Beijing Delayed Departure The New Beijing steamer was originally scheduled to depart at 5:00 PM. However, due to the cash being discovered by customs and the subsequent unloading and removal, it was unable to depart on time. It did not leave port until 7:30 PM, over two hours later than the original scheduled departure time.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Truth About the Suicide of Yih Ho Employee Shen Shou Kang <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Due to Gambling Addiction and Embezzlement of Public Funds</p>
<p>This newspaper reported on the 16th that Shen Shou Kang, a clerk in the accounting department of Yih Ho Foreign Firm, had committed suicide by drowning. According to another source, Shen had worked in the Yih Ho accounting department for five or six years, earning a monthly salary and an annual bonus, totaling around one hundred yuan per month. Initially, he was quite frugal. However, recently, due to a gambling addiction, he repeatedly misappropriated public funds. His father had helped him make up for it twice. This time, he had embezzled over three thousand yuan, which he could not account for, and used fake receipts to cover it up. His superior colleague, Mr. Zhang, discovered this and urged him to repay the money quickly, otherwise, if the compradore found out, it would be difficult to remedy. Shen then excused himself to go out and raise funds, but never returned. He sent a suicide note to his colleagues, saying that he had decided to jump into the sea to die. His whereabouts are still unknown. It is not yet known whether he is truly dead. His father pleaded with the compradore's office to compensate for the embezzlement and said that such an unfilial son had lost his life due to gambling, and even his death was not to be regretted.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Communist Bandits from Taixing Arrested in Shanghai <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Last year, in August and September, Taixing County in Jiangbei was repeatedly ravaged by communist bandits. Cases of arson, murder, and kidnapping occurred frequently. Although the military and police pursued and suppressed them, the major criminals all escaped the net. Huang Zhengxuan, the captain of the 4th squad of the 2nd district of the Taixing County Defense Corps, recently received a secret report that the bandit leader Ye Hongbin (also known as Wang Boxun) of Taixing had fled to Shanghai and was hiding at 54 Wenzhou Road. He specifically requested the county government to prepare a document, and Captain Huang personally came to Shanghai. The day before yesterday, he, together with detectives from the New Zha Police Station, secretly went to the address to arrest him. They arrested Ye and his accomplice Xiao Ruihong (also known as Zhu Guozhai). Yesterday, they were taken to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Ge interrogated them. According to Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, the document from Taixing only mentioned Ye and not Xiao Ruihong. He requested that Xiao be temporarily detained in the police station until the document for his transfer arrived. When questioned, Ye confessed that his hometown had been ravaged by communist bandits last year. The bandits wanted to coerce him, but he was unwilling to become a bandit, so his house was burned down. He then fled to Shanghai and had not committed any crimes. Xiao Ruihong confessed that he used to work in a factory in Wuxi and had come to Shanghai the day before yesterday, staying at Ye's place, and knew nothing else. Judge Ge concluded the preliminary hearing and ordered Ye Hongbin to be taken away by Captain Huang for handling according to the law. Xiao Ruihong was temporarily detained in the police station, and the county government should prepare a letter, detailing the facts of the crime, and send it to the court for review.</p>
