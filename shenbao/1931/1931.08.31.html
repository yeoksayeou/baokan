<p>中國科學社與中華農學會</p>
<p>農業凋敝科學衰落之現象及阻撓其進步之暗礁。旣如上述。今後吾人究應如何以打破現實。推其前進。换言之。即農學會與科學社諸君子所應努力者爲何。是則爲本評所最爲着目之點。</p>
<p>今且置消滅帝國主義在華勢力。及肅淸殘餘封建勢力不言。因此爲中國革命前途之根本問題。孫中山先生遺留有具體之方案與政策。至於如何打破國人心理上之暗礁。記者謹願貢其所見。</p>
<p>吾人試一檢閲世界文明進展之史册。對新事物厭恶反對之（恐新病。）在任何一國任何一世都爲不或避免之階段。當英國開始建築第一條鐵道時。英人都憤斥火車爲拖着煤烟與硫磺長尾之凶暴害物。當羅馬開始建築崇高之層樓時。辛尼加亦痛加斥責。認爲人類道德之危機。當汽車初發明時。英皇奥理連格因人民之反對。亦不敢一用。當浴池水管初在美國裝置時。報紙都斥爲過奢而非民主之物。要求政府科以重税。當眼鏡初輸入英國時。英人羣斥爲不道德。爲以假的眼光。使事物失去其本性。而今諸國則何如。回首陳跡。當爲啞然。我國目前之（恐新病。）尙不若此之甚。故上述心理上之暗礁。固有可救治而不足畏。要在先知先覺者如何努力耳。</p>
<p>努力之道爲何。即運用敎育之偉力是。</p>
<p>我國敎育。素重於書本上之吟哦。而忽於書本以外之實習敎者口講。學者耳聽。充其量亦僅限於背記定理。至於手之作用。則殆爲敎者學者所遺忘。故於近世之科學。知者多不能行。行者則又多不能知。敎室内之科學。無異於洋八股。實騐者之科學。則又僅能以意會而不可以言傳。科學其何由而普及。何由而進步。故今後科學家之敎育民衆。農業家之改良農業。應腦與手同時並用。並使受敎者能知亦能行。科學庶能收得實效。庶能期其普及與前進。此其一。科學敎育。應注重幼穉兒童。蓋兒童爲社會將來之中堅。新社會之基礎。即建築於幼小兒童之身上。而今日之幼穉敎育權。都操之於説神談　　　之女僕之手。純潔之兒童。不使其受科學之洗禮。而灌輸以舊社會穢濁　　爲科學發展前途之障碍。次之，一般民衆。無淺近趣味之科學讀本。科學故事供其閲覽。而（七俠五義）（西游）（封神）（黑幕大觀）等荒誕之神鬼經典。乃風行於民間。民衆知有玉皇大帝太上老君。而不知有瓦特安迪生知有水遁火遁腾雲飛行。而不知有熱力電流。民衆敎育權全爲此種書本所支配。民衆知識。乃日趨於怪诞堕落此亦爲障碍科學進步之大因。故今後科學家與農業家。應切實自女僕手中奪回　穉敎育權。自俠義神鬼之書本中奪回民衆敎育權。此其二。今日科學家小有發明。即存私念。但知取科學之熟菓。供一已之安逸。而不一着目於茫茫無知之大衆。但知求得一已之長。而不一着日於整個社會。故今後科學家應分其手中之熟菓。徧餉社會大衆。應造成一普遍繁榮之科學世界。而母造成一蔓草荒烟杳無人跡之科學世界。此其三。</p>
<p>上述三者。乃爲今日農業家與科學家所必須担負之責任。吾人謹以至誠祝望努力荷此重責。從本年年會開始。吾人更以無限熱忱。祝望下屆年會時。我國農業與科學。獲得極多成功之菓實。</p>

<h3 id="c75">補習敎育的效用在那裏 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>江問漁（三）</p>
<p>（三）就程度說、應分出若干等級、最低級的是和初級小學相等、如前文所說、這當然是中國特殊情形、不過同爲初小程度、却要把合於十歲以下兒童的敎材一部份除去、且要另加入職業訓練、初級的是和高級小學相等、中級的是和初級中學相等、高級的是和高級中學相等、此三級可以說是補敎的正宗、過此以往、還有最高級的、便要和專科學校一二年級相等了、共分五級似宜咸備、以應社會各方的需要、倘若再擴充一些、如夜大學如學術講座、便儼然和大學一部分課程相等了、</p>
<p>這就是我所主張的補習敎育、能發出偉大效力、能解决中國敎育困難問題的補習敎育、</p>
<p>我們試平心靜氣、就中國實際情形來觀察一下罷、一般社會是不是覺得學校敎育、太不適合於中國經濟社會狀况呢、一個中學生、每年要費二三百元、一個大學生、每年要費四五百元、中人之家、如何辦得了、辦不了而偏要硬辦、難怪嗟怨之聲、盈於道路了、不要說在人學一方面的人、是怨聲載道、就是在辦學一方面的人、因爲公私財力、十分艱窘、又何嘗不是疾首蹙額呢、我們親眼看見有許多天才生、的確可以造就成一個出類的人才、可是因爲他家道淸寒、無力培植、小學畢業以後、不能再上進、中學畢業以後、不能再升學、這是不是國家一個大大的損失、同時也有一班資禀學力不甚高明的青年、因爲受虚榮心的鼓盪、竟成为羣結隊的進那些無聊的大學、在學四載費欵累千、畢業以後、仍是無業可執、這是不是國家一個大大的危險、中學敎育、是以預備升學爲目的、而所升的大學、乃如此、一年一年、造出許多大學畢業生、布在社會、東拼西撞、已經無人過問了、其中學畢業不升學的、又那肯甘心降志、去學農學工學商呢、不肯學、也是在社會上東拼西撞、更是無人過問、所幸職業敎育已經有政府提倡於上、社會鼓吹於下了、然而學校設備需財、師資飬成　時、一時又那能設立許多、就是多設、一時又那能辦得皆好、（遠水不救近渴）將奈之何、這不是中國社會目前的實在情形麽、</p>
<p>我且不避煩瑣、再就都市及鄉村兩方面、分别的說一說、都市哩在工廠或商店以内的職工徒弟、曾經小學或初中畢業、有志上進、而苦無機會的、的確一天多似一天、這一班靑年、總算是社會生產分子了、他能願意於工作之暇、補習學業、那是毫不費他父兄一文的、可惜國家及社會竟没有許多適當敎育機關、以供給他的需要、這是多麽可憐、鄉村哩、目前小學校、是寥落如晨星、所以識字的人很少很少、但是一班從事於南畝的二十歲内外的靑年、農作有暇、茶館靜坐、束手閑游、有時却也感覺到不識字無知識的苦痛、願意讀讀書開一開眼無如現在也没有許多適當敎育機關、竟使他們永遠淪於黑暗世界、這又是多麽可憐、</p>

<p>恩施樊樊山先生增祥。爲一代宗匠。主持骚壇數十年。不幸以中風疾殂。享壽八十有六。先生生平所爲詩。除已刋者外。有二萬餘首之多。其最後遺作。實爲客冬所作之丹靑訣電影歌。爲齊白石林實馨兩畫師賦。歌云。有宋影戲始阜寗。彫繪人物蒙以繪。偃師提挈歌且舞。日月不照光在燈。（見呂惠卿對荆公語）訖今七百有餘載。　南渭北製作精。圓顱方趾不可見。剛如翦贴紙一層。海邦晚出擅淫巧。以電攝影羅萬形。登場怳疑游鏡殿。事事物物俱有情。獨惜歐美師鄭衛。探腰楊柳唇接櫻。東瀛有意整風俗。雅正力與奇袤爭。中華字畫有嗜癖。歲幣百萬收吳綾。酒喝詩狂齊白石。機聲燈影林實馨。以二畫師爲導演。揚州八怪逞其能。畫中有畫影中影。風雅好事推伊籐。樵林就齊商繪事。蛾眉並是高材生齊也白髯氣鬰勃。林也鬈髮雲鬅　。短布衣裁周伯况。敝袍紙補瘦蘭成。時維九月暖寒平。東籬菊秀風日晴。兩賢解衣勢磅礴。溪籐端玉陳中庭。曹衣吳带風水别。粗文細沉神鬼驚。雍邱蘇米接長案。一日宣箋百幅盈。畫成美人恣題品。汝南月旦皆眞評。自入門至評畫止。神工意匠煩經營。一畫照藥鏡。一鐙一影呈紗屏。一人一態無褻嫚。士則狂娟女則貞。影齣蟬媽過千尺。伊籐捲紙歸東京。東人雅愛樊山筆。影中惜少畫妃亭。丹靑訣影片。爲日本横濱銀行伊籐爲雄氏所攝製。吾國畫師齊白石林實聲兩氏所導演。故詩中云云。以此爲題。脫令他人爲之。直無從下筆。樊山先生好爲其難。舉重若輕。洵不愧騷壇盟主也。按先生爲遜淸丁卯翰林。累官江寗布政司。所至有政聲。而悉爲詩名所掩。民國外來。作春明寓公。優遊自得。好奬掖伶人。男女伶人因以成名者甚衆。今歲逝世時。外間所傳原因。多非事實。以予所知。先生在客歲重陽日。曾應曹經沅約赴天津登高。到津後。陳弢庵夏壽田諸先生以先生年高。爲之登報增加直例。有樊尙書語。淸室忽函各報。聲明僞冒。先生鬰鬰不樂者累日。已而其最锺愛之孫女某。又攖病夭折。先生痛之。自此胃納頓減。思想亦趨悲觀。未幾又跌傷足。愈而復跌。不能興。然猶不廢吟咏。後罹中風不語症。醫藥罔效。遂溘然長逝。即以不語。故無遺嘱。而最後遺作丹靑訣電影歌。則中風不語前淹滞病榻時所作也。</p>

<p>軍政部航空署航空第六隊練習跳保險傘。此舉在我國甚屬罕見。特摘紀跳傘時略情如下。</p>
<p>準備該隊此次練習跳保險傘。由隊長黄毓沛分隊長陳錫鴻首先試騐。以資敎練。先是隊中所有飛航員。由黄氏敎授跳傘理論及跳法。至練習跳傘之第一日。各飛航員於下午二時一律到機場集合。聽受未起飛前跳傘者之一切準備工作。</p>

<p>— 九</p>
<p>起飛　練習跳傘之機。爲可塞第六○四號。駕駛者乃副隊長黄毓全。試車妥當後。黄坐於左下翼。陳分隊長坐於右下翼。即於三時起飛。環城一週。直向東飛至孝陵圍之南隅。其時飛機高度約二千尺。黄陳兩隊長即離機躍下。</p>
<p>跳傘　跳傘者離機後。兩傘不久同時發開。距離約二丈。隨東風之吹送。約三分鐘即徐徐而下。安全降落於舊敎導師操塲。當時觀衆鼓掌歡呼。表示慶賀之意。而黄副隊長亦駕原機隨兩傘低飛在降落地點之低空。翺翔至黄陳二隊長乘汽車返機場時爲止。</p>
<p>降落　原擬以中山門外中山凹爲降落地點。後經黄隊長親自駕機勘明。認該處積水甚多。且多樹木。於保險傘恐有損壞之虞。故改爲舊敎導師操塲。最後黄陳兩氏便將經過情形。謁署長詳細報告。即返隊部休息。時已薄暮矣。</p>

<p>本年各省水災之重。亘古未有。滬上各界。本救災憫隣之誼。紛起援助。足見惻隠之心。人所同具。藝術界筆耕墨耨。硯田不豐。不才近方追隨王一亭狄楚靑李祖韓諸先生之後。從事大規模之聯合。將舉行書畫急振會。以期各盡心力。吾友俞劍華。本齊魯豪俠之士。方自雁蕩山中冩生以歸。聞余言。即慨將第三次個展出品百件。全數助振。已假定新世界飯店大廳。於九月四五六三日舉行。劍華旣在雁蕩山中寫生一月有餘。奇峯疊嶂。名潭怪瀑。已極人世之偉觀。而又加以雄渾之筆墨。蒼茫之氣勢。畫與山相得益彰。更精於飛禽走獸人物佛像。特深自緘秘。人無知者。今以救災之故。乃技無不盡。能無不竭。且定價又復低廉。以期人盡可購。所費不多。旣得精美之名作。又拯苦難之同胞。爲善最樂。何樂不爲。想屆時定當捷足爭先。瞬息一空矣。（移酬助賑）</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>國家派遣的公使·領事。對外即代表本國。所以使領於駐在國的榮辱。就是國家的榮辱。關係自然非常密切。我國派駐歐洲各國的使領。對國際上的信譽及辦理外交的手段。能有幾人是差强人意。在歐僑民·留學生都很明白的。有人說他们枵腹從公。已屬難能可貴。無需再嚴格批評。也有人說做我國的使領。要是資本家能籌墊經費的。才可以勝任。否則時常閙窮。怎能安於其職。語雖滑稽。亦近人情。據說使領館的窮困。不自今日始。不過近幾年來。有每况愈下之勢。譬如逢到我國國慶或是重大紀念日。照例須招待外賓。舉地盛典。意思是慶祝國運方興。兼之聯絡各友邦的感情。以前使領館必備盛宴。欵待上賓。到了去年。爲館費支絀。改行茶會。以目前的形勢推測。將後恐怕速茶會都開不成呢。在國際上最講究體面的。要算日本國。他們政府行政費的預算。寗可特别節省。惟獨於駐外使領館的經費。十分充足。單就這一點來比較。我們已相形見絀了。</p>
<p>歐洲人明瞭東方情形的。究屬少數。有此人連中國人與日本人都分不淸楚。看見神采雄偉而有禮貌的中國人。開起口來問一聲（你是日本人麽）。而於比較矮小的日本人。反誤認爲中國人。日本人從而假痴假呆的理論一番。好像說他中國人。就侮辱了他。老實不客氣說中國人卑賤到無惡不作的。我們日本人那可同他們比。這些人信以爲眞。幾乎視我中國人是劣等民族。居心不良的日本人。到處和我們捣蛋。大家總得牢記在心。有一天我們到比利時一個鄉村裏去。許多女人爭着來看我的脚。我伸起來給伊們看。才平服伊們好奇的疑寶。一位女人說。（我們也向來不曾見過中國人。但從小就聽說中國人是有尾巴的。（即辫髪）都要討姨太太的。女人都是小脚跑起路來一搖一擺的。如今才明白這話不確實。請原諒我們的錯念。）還有一人自以爲熟悉東亞情形的。带着譏笑的態度說。（中國的軍閥如何專横。到處閙的是兵匪。人民過着地獄的生活。）這種如是而非的話。說了一大堆。我說（此種傳說。全無根據。）同行的某君。也報以很滑稽的話。（我看你們那裏會知道立國數千年的大中華民國。等我們革命成功之後。簡直要把顯微鏡來照你們比利時呢。）就此一笑而散。（完）</p>

<p>（十一）思想之泉源</p>
<p>满淸賴洪承疇之規畫以定天下。而亦失於洪氏（十不）之策略。思想之偉能。較金錢槍砲爲厲矣。日人經營满蒙。以圖書館爲設計室。以研究所得之思想系統爲網領。一切農業工業之開發。均有條不紊。非贸然從事者也。以蘇俄極端之崇拜唯物國家。尙有（五年計劃）。爲其國家整個發展之綱領。然則吾人豈可蔑視思想或知識能力。而競競於金錢之奔逐乎。</p>
<p>圖書館與學校爲製造思想之工廠。日人經營我東北部。則圖書館與學校或其他關於專門學術之研究機關。爲其一切满蒙事業之原動力。瀋陽除奉天圖書館外。有南满醫科大學。旅順有工科大學。大連有職業專門學校及商業專門學校。余曾因黑田源次君之介紹。得參觀南满醫科大學。黑田氏留學德國有年。得有博士學位。現任該校敎授。在該校每週任課六小時。彼有研究室於該校之二階。（二層樓）室内備有書籍黑板。學生有時入其私室聽講。渠領予參歡漢醫書室。四壁書架满陳中文各種醫藥書籍。如黄帝内經等類。且多難得之本。殷殷指導講解。時時表示該校對於漢醫書籍收藏之特别注重。且有成績。另有巨室满藏中國各種藥材標本。以玻璃瓶分别標明品名產地。貯存陳列之。聞該校特别研究關於中國東北部之本草。大連满蒙資源館原有專門化騐满蒙土產藥材部。現亦歸併該校矣。往年予曾在大連满蒙資源館内。見有用科學化騐之中國藥材系統說明。令人一見某藥。即知其由如何製成。例如薄荷製成薄荷油之經過步驟。用原料陳列以線繋成變遷系統。甚簡單明瞭也。</p>
<p>（十二）東北思想製造所</p>
<p>日本各種專門學者。從事我東北部如何經營之思想製造。其在我東北部之各機關。均各從事满蒙某一種問題之專門研究。至我國方面之東北思想製造所。當首推東北大學。惟學校行政方面尙須更求進步。而亟確立開發東北之具體計。劃耳。</p>
<p>瀋陽大東門外。有遼寗省立圖書館。爲光緖三十四年十月創立者。藏書共九四九八四册自館長卞鴻懦氏接辦後。整理頗有成績。卞氏爲東北大學敎育學院敎授。頗有整理東北文獻之志。予居瀋陽以來。深感東北文獻有以科學方法整理之必要。想卞氏必將繼續努力也。現聞卞氏又調任東北蒙旗師範學校校長矣。該校前任校長爲郭道甫君。郭君呼倫貝爾人。即往年海拉爾共產黨起事對中國宣告獨立之蒙古靑年黨黨代表也。郭氏曾去俄國二次。稍能俄語。負有大志。欲紹承元成吉思汗事業。當時聯俄。謀蒙古獨立。後爲張學良氏託人說項。思想一變反俄。而就張氏秘書之職。兼任蒙旗校校長。海拉爾問題遂同時解决矣。郭氏性豪放。氣盛好談論。每來東北大學訪余。自午後談至子夜。滔滔偉論。皆彼一人發言。言均蒙古成吉思汗之歴史。予與李證剛君欵彼於大學内西新村十八號住宅。有時龍伯純君亦入座品茗。良解寂寞。</p>
<p>省立圖書館外。全省各縣縣立圖書館計四十二處。惟藏書有僅四五百册者。洮有縣鐵嶺縣遼陽縣方面有多至一萬册者。圖書館與學校。同爲思想製造所。中國東北部問題之解决。唯斯二者是賴。予更謂中日在满蒙之競進。尤以文化事業爲前鋒。</p>

<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>其時、一面使敵軍無暇補充、一面便利美軍的撤退和調往進攻梅齊歐起見、胡夫爾之戰遂减以九師之衆在九月十日左右進行、作戰目標則限於肅淸巴黎亞夫里谷鐵路綫、换句話說、我便可從容指揮進攻梅齊歐的戰事了、我把胡夫爾戰事範圍縮小、並請潘興司令担任新攻勢戰</p>
<p>離開里尼之前、我把我們所談的幾點歸納起來、並加上詳細說明、交給潘興司令、美軍總司令即以此爲根據、把自已觀察所得、在八月卅一日寫信給我、</p>
<p>爲解除困難和避免曠區時間起見、潘興司令·貝當司令·和我自已、即於九月二日在我的司令部集議、我们便把前天我送給潘興司令的覆信做會議的基礎、其内容如下、</p>
<p>我在八月卅日對於聯軍總攻之書面的意見和口頭的說明、</p>
<p>（一）在預定的方向、</p>
<p>（二）以聯軍最大的兵力、</p>
<p>（三）在最短的時間之内、</p>
<p>（四）在接濟和交通最好的狀况之下</p>
<p>美軍方面作戰的計劃、</p>
<p>（甲）縮小範圍向聖米希爾進攻、</p>
<p>（乙）在苗斯河之西進攻、這方面的戰事務必全力維持、</p>
<p>君如以爲進攻米希爾即使範圍縮小亦不能先期或同時担任、便應作罷、惟無論如何、苗斯河之西的戰事務必即行準備、請明日九月二日下午二時駕臨敝司令部與貝當貝司令和我切實合擬作戰大綱、</p>
<p>會議席上、潘興司令把能够担任進攻的美軍部隊審查之後、承認聖米希爾之戰和進攻梅齊歐並不重複、惟須彼此策應迅速、其計劃遂决定如下、</p>
<p>（一）聖米希爾的攻撃準備以八師至十師兵力在九月十日實行、</p>
<p>（二）苗斯河之西之攻撃由美軍（十二至十四師兵力）於九月廿至廿五之間在苗斯河亞岡間進行、法第四軍在左翼協助、全軍由貝當司令指揮、</p>
<p>這决議便立即通知兩總司令、作爲翌日九月三日總訓令的初步、</p>
<p>經過了談判和變更了計劃之後、聖米希爾的軍事於是着手進行、然而、更因（集中行動的極度紊雜、）這役尙須展缓四十八小時之久、</p>
<p>九月十二日、三千尊大砲轟撃了四小時、主力戰的部隊（美第四和第一聯隊）上午五時開始從西喜普萊里梅之綫向梯安谷進攻、前仆後繼、猛攻痛撃、敵軍無法抵抗、密佈的鐵絲網障碍物旣經衝過、防禦的中心相繼攻陷、大軍繼續衝鋒、向晚、便達到了全部目標、</p>
<p>其時、次要戰的部隊（美第五聯隊）也在上午八時從意拜奇前綫進攻、前進同樣的敏疾、當晚達到黑敦歇特、十三日晨、主力和次要攻撃之間、獲得了聯絡、</p>
<p>敵軍扼守聖米爾突角四年之久、卒被我軍幾小時内攻陷、德軍未能全部退走、因被我軍擒獲俘虜一萬三千二百五十人、大砲四百六十門、（未完）</p>

The Provincial Relief Association allocated 10,000 yuan to the Jiangbei Flood Relief Temporary Charity Association for use. Furthermore, Xu Jingren, a gentleman from Zhenjiang, remitted 10,000 yuan from Shanghai to the association to distribute to the disaster victims near Zhaoguan Dam.

<p>(Zhenjiang) The Jiangsu Provincial Relief Association held a meeting on the 30th and resolved to request Wang Yiting to take one million in construction public bonds to Shanghai as collateral for relief funds, with a minimum of 200,000 to be distributed to various counties.

(30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Liang, the commander-in-chief of the 25th Route Army, led more than a hundred sailors and rescue team members on the morning of the 30th, along with a ship of flour, cash, and waterproof engineering materials, and sailed to Gaoyou on the Hengde Steamboat to handle the aftermath of the flood. The directors of various departments of the headquarters and Wang, the secretary-general of the special party department of the 32nd Division, accompanied him. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Guanying telegraphed Beijing, stating that according to a telegram from Brigade Commander Shi De of the time, the Gaoyou river embankment had collapsed, causing countless deaths. He specially requisitioned five fireboats and many civilian boats, leading them in person on the morning of the 28th to provide relief.

(30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu Jiangbei Native Flood Relief Association of the Central Party Department telegraphed Jiang Yun, stating that the Jiangsu Yun embankment had collapsed, causing millions of lives to be destroyed, fields and homes submerged, and the disaster was extremely severe.

<p>(Hankou) The Yangtze River receded another inch on the 30th. The National Government's relief funds of 170,000 have been remitted to Hankou. A meeting is scheduled for the 31st to distribute them. 100,000 each from the Japanese Emperor and the American Red Cross will also be remitted soon. Since the Ministry of Finance's 300,000 arrived in Hankou on the 30th, it immediately convened the banking sector on the 31st to distribute funds to various Qianzhuang and cloth shops to activate finance. In addition, a large number of mat sheds and oil paper were transported to Hankou in two batches. The emergency relief association sent personnel to count and receive them and set up sheds on Hongshan to continue accommodating the refugees. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Jiang was still on the Yongsu Ship on the 30th. He Chengjun and He Baohua visited again, reporting the details of the disaster in E Province and Hankou City.

<h3 id="e5">Amount of Disaster Relief Bonds <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan strongly advocates 80 million</p>
<p>Each member is willing to fight for it with their resignation</p>
<p>Shao Yuanchong issued a statement yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the disaster relief bonds, most members of the Legislative Yuan believe that with 50 to 60 million disaster victims, even if 80 million is issued, plus the loan of American wheat, the total will only be 120 million, which is still very little for the disaster victims. It was decided to pass it again in the general meeting and ask the National Government to still issue 80 million and fight for it with their resignation. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shao Yuanchong made the following statement on the issuance of disaster relief bonds: The severity of this disaster is such that not only should our government do its best to provide relief, but all countries in the world have also expressed their sympathy. According to current estimates, there are more than 50 million disaster victims. If the Ministry of Finance's original plan of 10 million yuan is used for relief, it will not be enough for a few days. Although the government has negotiated with the United States to purchase wheat flour on credit, the amount is only 40 million yuan. However, this disaster relief cannot be accomplished by only focusing on symptomatic treatment. These disaster victims have lost the foundation for rebuilding their lives. The government must simultaneously find ways to properly plan for their resettlement. Otherwise, the hidden dangers will be unimaginable. If so, 80 million yuan is still a drop in the bucket. Therefore, the decision of the Legislative Yuan to increase the amount is based entirely on conscience and facts. It is by no means deliberately making things difficult for the financial authorities, nor is it comparable to seeking popularity for personal gain. As for the funding aspect, the current tobacco tax can collect more than 5 million yuan per month. After deducting various designated funds, there is still a surplus of more than 1 million yuan per month. Furthermore, the tobacco treasury bonds that continued to be issued in the 18th year will expire in January next year, which will result in a surplus of 1 million yuan per month. This public bond needs to start repaying principal and interest from February next year. The first phase is 6.04 million, which is sufficient to cover with a monthly surplus of 1 million. It is expected that the repayment amount will decrease and the income will increase from the second phase, which makes it clear that the fund is reliable. Minister Song said that the government has negotiated with the United States to purchase 40 million yuan of wheat flour, but even this is only 120 million yuan. Given such a huge disaster, there is no concern that the amount is too large. The intention of forming another fund custody committee is that this public bond is of a special nature. To facilitate its promotion, it is proposed that the audit department, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and the two banking associations each appoint a representative to organize it. The purpose is to design it meticulously and raise funds quickly, not because the original custody committee is unreliable. The members of this academy are willing to fight for it with their resignation, because we are public servants of the people. In the face of such a great disaster, if we do not do our best, we will have nothing to thank the people of the country. The rumor that I have telegraphed Chairman Jiang for his opinion is not true, because the case has already been decided, and it is not allowed to change it again with personal intentions.

<p>The Hebei Party Department decided to question Ge Jingen</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang visited Xu Yongchang at 6 pm today to discuss the issue of Yan and Feng going abroad. Han Fuqu is scheduled to leave Beiping and return to Jinan within one or two days. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng said that he and Han Fuqu will return to Jinan within one or two days. The issue of Yan and Feng will be handled by Jiang and Zhang. Han and all the generals unanimously advocated that Yan and Feng should go abroad as soon as possible. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wu Tiecheng said that the issue of Yan and Feng going abroad has been discussed by the generals for several days, and they all advocate that Yan and Feng should go abroad. It is beneficial for Shanxi Province, Yan and Feng personally, and the security of North China if they go abroad. Vice Zhang said that he planned to invite Yan to live in Beiping and could be responsible for his protection. It is imperative for Yan and Feng to leave. Since there is still hope for peace in Guangdong, he will do his best to mediate and strive for a political solution. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Hebei Provincial Party Department decided to question Ge Jingen, stating that Ge, as the Deputy Chief of Staff of the National Government, failed to arrest Yan, who was wanted by the central government, but instead privately met with him, and in his remarks in the newspaper, regarded Yan as an elder and vigorously defended him, saying that he was not colluding with Japan, which was clearly a violation of the central government's orders and an endorsement of a rebel.

The water level in the three upper reaches of the river is now an average of more than three feet lower than the highest water level. Zhang has set out to supervise construction 11 times this year. The staff is excited, the materials are complete, and the spring compartments are also very strong. Currently, the engineering situation of the tenth dam of Li Shengcun is more urgent.

<p>Mexican Authorities Indulge Popular Anti-Chinese Sentiment, Impose Re-entry Taxes</p>
<p>Negotiations Lack Support, Our People Are Butchered Everywhere</p>
<p>From a National Telegram of the 29th from Mexico City: The perilous situation of overseas Chinese in Mexico is rapidly reaching its peak. Today, a telegram from the Chinese Consulate in Nogales, a city on the US-Mexico border, reports that the Chinese Legation there has 1,000 homeless overseas Chinese gathered on the border, awaiting orders. Because of strict US immigration bans, they cannot enter the US.  Due to the threats of the Mexican Anti-Chinese Committee, they cannot remain in Mexico. They are truly in a situation where there is no way to heaven and no door to earth. Currently, Chinese diplomatic representatives are in contact with the US government to allow the overseas Chinese to temporarily enter US territory to take ships back to China. However, Mexican immigration officials are again acting as accomplices, claiming that if overseas Chinese do not have passports, or unless each person pays US$50, they will refuse to issue transit permits. Chinese Minister Xiong Chongzhi has today telegraphed the US Secretary of State in Washington, requesting the US government to make special accommodations to allow the overseas Chinese to temporarily enter US territory. Xiong hopes that US authorities will temporarily open the border restrictions in border towns such as Nogales, Douglas, and Naco to allow Chinese to temporarily enter and stay. Minister Xiong will again visit the Mexican President on Monday to request protection for overseas Chinese. At this time, the Anti-Chinese Committee is still actively exerting its influence. The only hope of the overseas Chinese rests on Minister Xiong's negotiations and the US's permission for entry.</p>

<p>Reuters, 29th, London Telegram: Yesterday's meeting of the three parties showed that the new government can command a majority of at least fifty votes in the House of Commons, as the Conservative and Liberal parties almost unanimously support the new government. The House of Commons has 612 votes. The government can obtain 261 Conservative votes, 55 Liberal votes, 6 Labour votes, 3 Independent Labour votes, and 6 other Independent votes, for a total of 331 votes. Reuters, 29th, London Telegram: British Prime Minister MacDonald, who has been the Labour representative for the Seaham Harbour constituency in the House of Commons since May 1929, recently sent a letter to the executive committee of the constituency Labour Party, saying that if the financial crisis is not resolved, national industry will be greatly disrupted, wages will certainly be shaken, unemployment benefits will be impossible to maintain, and tens of millions of pounds of wages for the working class will have nowhere to land. The change of cabinet is truly regrettable. He is willing to be sacrificed to save the workers and is willing to accept punishment. What else dare he say? After a long discussion, the Seaham Harbour Labour Party Executive Committee unanimously decided to recommend to the constituency Labour Representatives' Conference that MacDonald be asked to resign from his parliamentary seat in the constituency.</p>

<p>National News Agency, 29th, Berlin Telegram: The German delegation left here this afternoon for Geneva to attend the League of Nations Conference. The chief delegate is Foreign Minister Curtius, followed by disarmament expert Pence Baff. Prime Minister Bruning and Foreign Ministry officials went to the station to see them off. Soviet Russia's representative to the European Commission, Litvinov, and his party also traveled in the same train.</p>
<p>National News Agency, 29th, Paris Telegram: Foreign Minister Briand returned to Beijing tonight and will lead the French delegation to Geneva tomorrow. After returning to Beijing, Briand held secret talks with Polish Foreign Minister Schleski at the Foreign Ministry for a long time. When Schleski met with reporters, he refuted many of the remarks made by Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Litvinov in Berlin yesterday regarding the Russo-Polish non-aggression treaty. The Paris Times published a lengthy article this morning discussing the Russo-French non-aggression treaty, firmly advocating that France's precondition for signing the treaty should not only be the establishment of a similar treaty between Russia and Poland but also the conclusion of a similar treaty between Soviet Russia and Romania. This condition is naturally unacceptable to Soviet Russia, so the Russo-Polish talks and the talks between Briand and Litvinov in Geneva have attracted much attention in recent days. However, due to differing opinions on both sides, a conclusion may not be reached in the short term. Reuters, 29th, Paris Telegram: According to official sources, France is indeed preparing to relinquish its mandate over Syria and will announce this intention at the League of Nations meeting in Geneva. Iraqi King Faisal said in Paris that this is a gesture worthy of France.</p>

<p>National News Agency, 29th, Berlin Telegram: Dr. Meyer has been appointed as the head of the Eastern Section of the Foreign Ministry. It is said that he will soon be reassigned as the Minister to China. According to reports, the Doctor went to China in 1913 and served as the secretary of the German Embassy. After the outbreak of the European War, he disguised himself as a sailor and returned to China from Shanghai on a Norwegian ship. He was discovered by British officials in Gibraltar and held in a prisoner-of-war camp. He later escaped back to Germany and served as an artillery officer, repeatedly making meritorious achievements and receiving high-level medals.</p>
<p>National News Agency, 29th, Berlin Telegram: This morning, a large number of armed police surrounded four rows of houses inhabited by workers. Several thousand plainclothes detectives and police searched house by house, which was extremely strict, as the area is known for its communism. The results of the search are not yet known, but it is said that seventeen pistols, fourteen bayonets, and one rifle have been found, and sixty people have been arrested, most of whom have not registered their addresses with the police station.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Two Major Annual Meetings of China's Academic Circles Recently (4) <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Science Society of China and the Chinese Agricultural Society</p>
<p>The phenomenon of agricultural decline and scientific stagnation, as well as the hidden obstacles hindering their progress, are as described above. What should we do in the future to break the reality and promote its progress? In other words, what should the gentlemen of the Agricultural Society and the Science Society strive for? This is the point that this commentary pays the most attention to.</p>
<p>For now, let's not talk about eliminating the forces of imperialism in China and clearing the remaining feudal forces, because these are the fundamental issues for the future of the Chinese revolution. Mr. Sun Yat-sen left behind concrete plans and policies. As for how to break the psychological obstacles of the Chinese people, the reporter would like to offer his views.</p>
<p>If we examine the history of the progress of world civilization, aversion to and opposition to new things ("fear of the new disease") is an unavoidable stage in any country or in any era. When Britain began to build the first railway, the British people angrily denounced the train as a ferocious and harmful thing dragging a long tail of coal smoke and sulfur. When Rome began to build towering multi-story buildings, Seneca also painfully denounced it, believing it to be a crisis of human morality. When automobiles were first invented, King Olige of England did not dare to use them due to popular opposition. When bathtubs were first installed in the United States, newspapers denounced them as extravagant and undemocratic, demanding that the government impose heavy taxes. When glasses were first imported into England, the English people generally denounced them as immoral, as using false eyes to make things lose their true nature. But what about the countries now? Looking back on the past, one should be dumbfounded. China's current ("fear of the new disease") is not as severe as this. Therefore, the above-mentioned psychological obstacles are curable and not to be feared. The key lies in how the pioneers should work hard.</p>
<p>What is the way to work hard? It is to use the great power of education.</p>
<p>Chinese education has always emphasized recitation in books and neglected practice outside of books. Teachers lecture orally, and students listen. At most, it is limited to memorizing theorems. As for the function of the hand, it is almost forgotten by teachers and students. Therefore, many people who know modern science cannot practice it, and those who can practice it often cannot know it. Science in the classroom is no different from foreign stereotypes. The science of those who experiment can only be understood intuitively and cannot be expressed in words. How can science be popularized? How can it progress? Therefore, in the future, scientists should educate the public, and agriculturalists should improve agriculture, using both the brain and the hands at the same time, and enabling the educated to know and to practice. Science can then achieve practical results, and its popularization and progress can be expected. This is one. Scientific education should focus on young children, because children are the mainstay of the future society, and the foundation of the new society is built on young children. However, today's educational power for young children is in the hands of nursemaids who talk about gods and ghosts. Pure children are not allowed to receive the baptism of science and are instead instilled with the filth of the old society, which is an obstacle to the future development of science. Secondly, the general public lacks simple and interesting science readers and science stories to read. Instead, absurd classics of gods and ghosts such as "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants," "Journey to the West," "Investiture of the Gods," and "Black Curtain Grand View" are popular among the people. The people know about the Jade Emperor and the Supreme Lord Lao, but they do not know about Watt and Edison. They know about water evasion, fire evasion, and flying through the clouds, but they do not know about thermal power and electric current. The power of popular education is entirely dominated by these books. Popular knowledge is becoming increasingly bizarre and degenerate. This is also a major cause of hindering the progress of science. Therefore, in the future, scientists and agriculturalists should earnestly seize the educational power for young children from the hands of nursemaids and seize the educational power of the people from the books of chivalry, gods, and ghosts. This is two. Today, scientists have small inventions and keep them to themselves. They only know how to take the ripe fruit of science for their own comfort, and they do not pay attention to the vast, ignorant masses. They only know how to seek their own advantages and do not pay attention to the entire society. Therefore, in the future, scientists should share the ripe fruit in their hands with the general public and should create a universally prosperous scientific world rather than a desolate and uninhabited scientific world. This is three.</p>
<p>The above three are the responsibilities that agriculturalists and scientists must bear today. We sincerely hope that they will work hard to shoulder this heavy responsibility, starting from this year's annual meeting. We also wish with infinite enthusiasm that in the next annual meeting, China's agriculture and science will achieve many successful fruits.</p>

<p>From Zhenjiang to All Newspapers, Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, Jiangsu Relief Association, With Respect: The water level of the canal dyke and lake beside Gaoyou City is more than two zhang above the ground. On the night of August 25, a strong northwest wind blew, and huge waves surged against the dyke. Rescue efforts were ineffective, and there were multiple breaches. Telecommunications were cut off, and floods poured into the city, causing countless deaths. The remaining people are crying out for food. The disaster is severe and unprecedented in a century. Please appeal widely and quickly allocate large sums of money to provide emergency relief to save those who are dying. Wang Long, Magistrate of Gaoyou County and Chairman of the Relief Sub-Association, bows with a sinking seal.</p>
<p>From Zhenjiang 2 to All Newspapers to All National Legal Groups, With Respect: The floods in northern Jiangsu this time are the worst seen in nearly a century. Wherever the floods reach, houses are destroyed, and lives are lost. It is impossible to count the losses. Therefore, the tops of trees and roofs are all areas for escaping for one's life. Living outdoors in the wind and eating in the open, hunger and disease are intertwined. If relief is not urgently planned, the people who do not die from the water will surely die from hunger and disease. The observations of this association are shocking. Although the government is concerned about the disaster victims and provides relief, the disaster area is so large that it is difficult to provide universal relief. Our colleagues are also clumsy and have more than enough heart, and it is not easy to continue. We can only ask all great benefactors to uphold the virtue of heaven's love for life and embrace the spirit of human mutual assistance, either donating righteous grain or contributing generous sums. The blessings will be spread, and the disaster will be alleviated. This merit and this virtue will be more than just building a seven-story pagoda. The representatives of this association, representing hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in northern Jiangsu awaiting death, bow their heads a hundred times before all great benefactors and stand and ask for help. Receiving address: Zhenjiang Association, Shanghai Flood Relief Association's designated Bank of China, Bank of Jiangsu, Yanye Bank, Jincheng Bank.

<h3 id="e46">After Chairman Chiang's Arrival in Hankou <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Decision on Hubei Disaster Relief Measures</p>
<p>He Chengjun and Others Petition for Assistance</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang, who was in Jiangxi supervising the suppression of the Red Bandits, suddenly arrived in Hankou on the Yong Sui warship amidst military victories to inspect the floods. This trip had no prior indication, so the outside world did not know about it. Even the government authorities did not have definite information. The disaster victims in Wuhan, who had been trapped in the floods for a long time, were all extremely inspired by the sudden arrival. Previously, Chiang learned in Nanjing that the disaster in Hubei was severe and was deeply concerned. In addition to allocating funds for relief and sending personnel to investigate, he decided to personally inspect Hankou when he arrived in Jiangxi. At 3:00 p.m. on the 27th, he took the Yong Sui warship west from Jiujiang, accompanied only by the Chu You warship. Li Mingzhong, the Pacification Superintendent of the Hubei, Henan, and Anhui Border Area, and He Qigong, a member of the Party and Government Committee of the Nanchang Camp, traveled with him. He Chengjun, the Director of the Wuhan Camp, received Chairman Chiang's telegraphic announcement at 4:00 p.m. that day. He immediately set up a temporary headquarters in the Hubei Provincial Government and led Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Fang Benren, Liu Wendao, and other important figures to gather at the Sanbei Company Wharf to greet him. He also ordered the 77th Regiment of the 13th Division, the Gendarmerie Battalion of the 48th Division, and the detective team of the Wuhan Garrison Command Inspection Office to be responsible for security. At 7:25 p.m., the Yong Sui and Chu You warships arrived at the port and docked on the Jiangnan River. He Chengjun and others took a small ferry across the river from the Sanbei Shipping Wharf to board the ship and pay their respects. Chiang immediately inquired about the general situation of the flood and the relief efforts, which He reported one by one. It is said that Chiang stated that the flood in Hubei Province was indeed more severe than in other provinces. The first step at present should be to regulate finance and maintain food supply. He immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Hankou Central Bank to allocate 300,000 yuan to activate finance, and also telegraphed the governments of Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces to lift the rice ban to supply food. He also decided to convene a meeting of all sectors of Hubei within a day or two to discuss fundamental disaster relief measures in order to thoroughly provide relief.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang arrived in Hankou and did not want to land, so he still stayed on the Yong Sui warship. On the morning of the 29th, Camp Director He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, the Bandit Suppression Superintendent of the Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei Border Area, Xia Douyin, the Wuhan Garrison Commander, Liu Wendao, the Director of the Hubei Civil Affairs Department, and Fang Benren, a member of the Hubei Branch of the National Government Flood Relief Association, all boarded the ship to pay their respects. He also personally submitted a memorial requesting special relief. Chiang immediately agreed and decided on his views on the Hubei disaster. In terms of temporary solutions, he would first pay attention to emergency relief. In terms of fundamental solutions, he would engage in dredging the river. To gather more ideas, he would convene people from all walks of life to have a public discussion within days in order to be thorough. He and others then resigned. In the afternoon, Zuo Duo, Wang Shijian, Yu Yuzhi, Wang Xianmao, members of the Provincial Party Department Rectification Committee, and Li Yizhong, Shan Chengyi, Pang Jingtang, Wu Qiyun, and other members of the Municipal Party Department Rectification Committee, also boarded the ship to report on the situation of party affairs in Hubei Province and Hankou City, as well as the progress of assisting the government in handling flood investigation and relief. It was also decided that on Monday (the 31st), a grand memorial week would be held at the Hubei Provincial Government, and Chairman Chiang would be invited to attend in person. Chiang had already agreed in person and instructed the members to do more relief work during the flood. The members also took their leave after hearing the instructions. As for He Chengjun's memorial, it described the flood in great detail. According to reporters, it is disclosed as follows: (Respectfully submitted: This flood is unprecedented in hundreds of years. We are grateful for the central government's dispatch of senior officials to investigate and provide relief, and we are also grateful for your personal inspection, which has given hope to the dying disaster victims. We are grateful for your compassion. The disaster in Hubei is particularly severe. Around mid-August, a total of 45 counties reported disasters one after another, with an estimated urgent need for relief to more than 10 million disaster victims. The Hubei Provincial Government Civil Affairs Department has already filled out and printed a summary table of the flood situation in various counties of Hubei for review. Since then, the flood has continued to rise, and the dikes in various places have become ineffective, causing more and more breaches. For example, the Fankou dike in Echeng breached hundreds of zhang on the 18th of this month, and the waves filled the sky, submerging seven counties including Yangxin, Daye, and Echeng. The people, in addition to deaths, fled to the mountain ridges, crying out for food. The number of disaster victims has continued to increase, and the number of disaster victims awaiting relief is estimated to be no less than a small number. The people affected by the disaster and awaiting relief this time have no harvest at all in the autumn, and they do not know when they will be able to sow in the coming year. If the first step is to provide relief for one month, with a minimum of three yuan per person per month, it will cost approximately 30 million yuan. After the flood recedes, those who have homes to return to will still need the government to provide farming tools, seeds, and plowing cattle. Those who have no homes to return to can either be moved to other places to cultivate or select strong laborers to implement the method of work for relief, such as opening rivers, repairing dikes, and building roads. The funds needed are even greater. At present, Hubei Province's treasury is empty and cannot find a way to raise funds. Even if we persuade people to donate in various ways, it is like a drop in the bucket and will not help. We beg you to instruct the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior and the Flood Relief Association to consider that Hubei Province has suffered an unusually severe disaster, which is different from the situation in other provinces, and to quickly raise large sums of money, food, and various other necessities to continuously provide relief to save the people and maintain the overall situation. The exact number of disaster victims in the province and the actual situation of disaster relief are being investigated in various ways. Once the investigation is completed, we will submit it for review. Respectfully submitted, (August 29)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Hubei Province Prepares for Immigration <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Total Number of Disaster Victims is No Less Than 15 Million</p>
<p>In Addition to Agricultural and Industrial Revitalization, the Remainder Will Be Transplanted to Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>The Hubei Branch of the National Government Flood Relief Association is Established</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: This year's flood in Hubei Province is most serious in 45 counties. The three towns of Wuhan were especially tragically affected. The total number of disaster victims is no less than 15 million. The fields are full of wailing, crying out for food. In order to provide widespread relief, the authorities, in addition to providing funds for relief, are also paying attention to post-disaster problems. Therefore, the calls for industrial revitalization and agricultural revitalization have become very loud. In terms of industrial revitalization, there are projects such as repairing the riverside road along the Yangtze River in Hankou, opening up tributaries of the Xianghe River, and dredging various projects on the Yangtze River. In terms of agricultural revitalization, there are projects such as establishing farmers' banks to manage farming tools, seeds, plowing cattle, etc., so that disaster victims can still maintain their lives amidst extreme hardship. The intention is very good. However, these matters are of great importance and cannot be carried out all at once. Disaster victims are gathered in Wuhan, and the number of victims grows, causing the Party to be exhausted in dealing with them. The Emergency Flood Relief Association submitted it for discussion at the 13th Standing Committee Meeting and decided to prepare to immigrate to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and on the 29th, sent a telegram to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to seek their opinions for overall planning. The telegram said: (The flood in Hubei Province is extremely severe, and Wuhan has become a swamp, and disaster victims from various places are flocking here one after another and being continuously received. We are now exhausted in dealing with them. Many disaster victims have requested to go to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to seek food. After the meeting, the 13th Standing Committee Meeting discussed the matter and decided to send a telegram to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to inquire whether they can accommodate the disaster victims, or how many they can accommodate. We will make an overall plan after receiving the reply telegram, etc., recorded in the minutes. We believe that immigration to seek food is recorded in the canons, and disaster relief and caring for neighbors are related to righteousness. We are sending you a special telegram and hope to receive a reply.)</p>
<p>The water level of the Yangtze River in Wuhan has slightly receded in recent days. As of the 28th, the water mark was 52 feet 7 inches, which is more than 7 inches lower than the highest point. Various businesses have slightly resumed operations, and the removal of accumulated water is also being carried out very actively. Before the removal of water, large-scale crossing bridges will be built and divided into five lines to facilitate traffic. It will probably be completed within a week. After the flood occurred, the Camp established a disaster prevention office to command everything in order to rescue the dikes and maintain law and order. It was the highest authority during the flood. Recently, the work of the office has come to an end because all dikes are no longer dangerous, with the exception of a few that have collapsed, and the arrangements for law and order are particularly complete. In the future, the focus will be on relief and fundraising, which will be jointly handled by the Emergency Relief Association and the Hubei Branch of the National Government Flood Relief Association. The branch was recently established and has six offices. The organizational outline has been reported to the National Government Disaster Relief Association for record. (August 29)</p>

<h3 id="e51">Overview of Flood Conditions in Various Counties and Cities in Hubei <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Hankou: After the breaches at Danshui Pool and Dandong Gate, the entire city of Hankou, except for the highest ground in Dajia Street and Huangpi Street, which retained a little dry land, was completely flooded. The deepest areas reached two zhang, and even the shallower areas were several feet deep. The deaths of people and livestock, as well as the loss of property, were countless. It is estimated that there are over 200,000 refugees in the entire town. (Relief measures) The Emergency Flood Relief Association sends people daily to distribute steamed buns per person.</p>
<p>Baisha Zhou and newly silted Zhou areas under the jurisdiction of Wuchang County are low-lying and have long become a watery realm. All houses and utensils have been submerged. After July 27th, the Wu Tai Ding Gong Temple long embankment and the Wu Qing Dike Gate were successively breached. The residents' fields and houses inside the embankment were completely swept away. The upper reaches of the provincial capital became a vast expanse of water. On the 28th, two breaches occurred in the Yongbao Embankment, and on the 29th, three breaches occurred in the Wuhui Embankment. Residents inside the embankment with lower foundations had no time to care for their houses and belongings. The Bajiyongfeng area was the most tragic. On August 15th, the Chopsticks Lake Embankment was breached, causing more than half of the area behind the provincial capital to be flooded. At noon on the 19th, the Wufeng Wilderness Five Li Embankment was breached, and the downstream area of the provincial capital was flooded again. The water was connected, and there was a tendency for water to enter Tongxiang Gate and Pinghu Gate. Except for a few hills, there was no dry land in the provincial capital. (Relief measures) The Emergency Relief Association office and various charitable halls send people to distribute steamed buns. In Hanyang County, the breached embankments include the Liuzhou Embankment, Xiaozhou Embankment, Liuhe Embankment, Yihe Embankment, Tiesuo Embankment, Daxing Embankment, Fuxing Embankment, Zixinshang Embankment, Changfeng Embankment, Xiexin Embankment, Tongfu Embankment, Xinglong Embankment, Mouni Embankment, Sanmin Embankment, Tongle Embankment, Fengle Embankment, Tongxing Embankment, Hexing Embankment, Duli Embankment, Xiaoyuan Embankment, Dayou Embankment, etc. During the breaching of the Dazhou Embankment, more than a hundred boaters were drowned. Most people can only travel by boat. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocate 200 shi of relief rice and telegraph the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief. In Yunmeng County, the northwest is high and flat, while the southeast is low and prone to water accumulation. Nine out of ten areas rely on embankments for flood prevention. The Fuhe Embankment is critical for the entire county. Since the breaching of the embankment and the breaches at Majia Embankment and Yujiawan, over two hundred people have been drowned. Countless large and small embankments have been breached. The flooded areas include the twelve associations of Pearl Xu Xin, etc., in the first district, the twelve associations of Xing'an Xun Jia Shangzi, etc., in the second district, the fourteen associations of Peng Jia Hejian, etc., in the third district, and the four associations of Hao Shi Tu Qiao, etc., in the fourth district. In total, more than half of the county's seventy-two associations have been flooded. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocate 600 shi of relief rice and telegraph the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>In Xiaogan County, the scale of the disaster area is such that not only are over ninety</p>
<p>embankments in the east, west, and south countryside completely submerged, but even the highlands and plains in the north countryside have also been flooded. All of the gardens, Sanbu, Jingzui, Huangxiaojie River, and the Pengjiawan area near the city, covering more than a hundred li, with residents from dozens of associations, were suddenly inundated by the swift and fierce water currents. Many men, women, old, and young were drowned because they could not escape in time. Those who survived either perched on rooftops or clung to treetops, and their cries of sorrow were unbearable to hear. In recent days, torrential rains have been continuous, and mountain floods have recurred, causing the water levels in the north and south ridges to suddenly rise several feet. The previous flood has not receded, and the subsequent flood has added to the devastation. The people are living in the midst of raging floods and have no way to survive or find food. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocate 600 shi of relief rice and telegraph the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>In Qianjiang County, in the first district, the Dongjing River, Tianjing Du, and Hualandi Embankments were breached, and the district was also affected by the breach of the Yuekou Xiaxi Embankment, resulting in the flooding of two-thirds of the entire district. In the second district, the Tuzhou Jiangjia Guai Xiang Embankment and Daci Pavilion Dongjing River Embankment were breached, and the entire district was submerged. In the third district, the Xijing River Changbo Hualan Embankment was breached, resulting in the flooding of one-half of the entire district. In the fourth district, the Fangjiawan Xiang Embankment was breached, resulting in the flooding of two-thirds of the entire district. In total, approximately one hundred embankments out of more than one hundred and fifty in the county's four districts are currently flooded. People have lost their homes and lack food and clothing. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocate 600 shi of relief rice and telegraph the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>In Yingcheng County, bordering the Yun River to the east and Taihu and Fu Rivers to the south, heavy summer rains lasted for ten days, and mountain floods erupted, causing raging waves to overflow for hundreds of li. The original embankments were all breached. Furthermore, the Han River flooded, and the downstream was blocked, causing the water level to rise daily. The county seat was also flooded. Looking from the city walls, a vast expanse of water could be seen. Countless houses were washed away, and livestock were drowned. On August 5th, thunderstorms continued throughout the night, and the floodwaters returned, turning the plains outside the city into a watery realm once again. All of the water and land crops were submerged. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocate 400 shi of relief rice and telegraph the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>In Qianshui County, the North Yonggan Embankment and the Yonggu Tributary Embankment were successively breached, and the Yongbao Embankment was quickly destroyed. The Maoshan Embankment Kandi was also washed away by the water due to its location downstream of Jiongfeng Ji. Fields and crops were submerged, and there is no hope for harvest. The extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster are unprecedented. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocate 300 shi of relief rice and telegraph the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>In Mianyang County, about three or four li from the Xin Embankment, there were several breaches in the Zidi Embankment of the Xiongjia Kiln on the Jiang Embankment. The Jiang Embankment in Niuze was also submerged in two places. The people's houses at the breach were damaged. As for the Xiang River, the water rose several zhang overnight, causing the Wangjiakou Hong Embankment of the Dazhu Embankment to be breached, submerging fourteen embankments and washing away more than four thousand houses. On the tenth, the water reached the Dai River, breaching and submerging seven embankments, with five breaches and washing away more than five thousand houses. In addition, the hundred-plus embankments under the jurisdiction of Pai Lake also flowed directly into the lake from the breach in the Xiang River, submerging everything completely. The Jiang Embankment in the Zhujiafeng area, more than twenty li above the Xin Embankment, and the Hujia Zhou area, more than thirty li below, were also breached in many places. The entire city of Xin Embankment became a watery realm. Furthermore, due to the breaches in the embankments of neighboring counties, eighty-nine embankments, including Guandi Cheng, were submerged. The shallow riverbed also caused fifty-nine embankments, including Wenyan Eight Cities, to be submerged. The backflow of the river also submerged the fields and houses of twenty-seven embankments, including Zhoulao Lake, and both people and livestock were drifting everywhere. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocate 600 shi of relief rice and telegraph the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>In Hanchuan County, the Jiangxi Embankment was breached by water in early July, causing the collapse of the adjacent Mabu Yinjia District, Danling Hechangling Embankment, and dozens of embankments in the northwest at the same time. Furthermore, the northern countryside of the county is particularly low-lying, and all the Daxing Chenjia Yongfeng Embankments were submerged. Therefore, the severity of the disaster is rare in decades. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocate 300 shi of relief rice and telegraph the Emergency Relief Association to find ways to provide relief.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Disaster Situation and Relief After the Dike Breach <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: After the breaches of the Shaobo and Gaoyou Dikes, the disaster situation has expanded. Letters and telegrams from all sides are flying, urgently seeking post-disaster measures such as saving lives, providing disaster relief, recovering corpses, and blocking breaches. The following is a selection of important news received today: Situation of Disaster in Shaogao Town: According to a report from an investigator on the ground in Gaoshao, before the Shaobo Dike was breached, a strong northwest wind blew, followed by hail. A large barge passing in front of the Guan Post Station was about to capsize. The boaters used bamboo poles to hook onto the dam stones there. Unexpectedly, when the poles were pulled out, the stones were loosened, and the lake water rushed in and collapsed. Each breach then continued to break. The north and south ends of Shao Street were severely affected, while the middle section was lighter. Salt warehouses lost about a thousand packages of edible salt. The entire city was flooded, with seven or eight out of ten houses destroyed. Countless people died. Nearby villages and towns, such as Yangjia Village and Qiaoshu Town, had similar disaster conditions. Countless people also died. Thousands of disaster victims fled to high mounds of earth to await rescue. However, the waves and water at the breaches were dangerous, and boats could not get close, leaving them helpless. Before the breach of the Gaoyou Dike, many prisoners escaped from the collapsed prison, and temporary precautions were taken, with all four gates closed. It was only when the water arrived that they realized the situation. The area outside the North Gate and the North Market bore the brunt, with a depth of about one zhang. Gaoyou's essence was originally in the North Market, which was completely washed away. Only the salt shops and the Yuhang Flour Company remained, with solid buildings that did not collapse. The salt shop staff all lived upstairs, and the two hundred-plus workers at the Yuhang Company also went upstairs to escape the disaster. They were only rescued by boat on the twenty-eighth. The middle market had higher terrain, with the highest foundation at Ma Junqing's house, which was only submerged by a foot or so and did not injure anyone. Those going to survey the disaster entered the front gate and used small boats to travel. The water at the North Gate was deep, making it impossible to travel by boat. Although the east and west gates were blocked, the city walls were on the verge of collapse. The two ends of the Jade Horse Head fell, with the middle section still remaining, with hundreds of refugees on top. However, the water was deep and the boat was dangerous, making it inconvenient to distribute relief. Only Wang Yunzhi risked his life to distribute dry food once. The water at the North Gate has now receded by more than half, with a depth of only three feet. However, corpses are everywhere inside and outside the city, all submerged in the water (because there are no coffins to collect them and no land to bury them, so no one is recovering corpses). The stench of decay fills the air, and the disaster victims there are still drinking this water. It is feared that an epidemic will inevitably break out in the future. News of Emergency Relief from the Emergency Relief Association: The Jiangdu Flood Emergency Relief Association learned on the evening of the twenty-eighth that the county magistrate had issued an order to allocate six thousand yuan to handle emergency relief. A special letter was sent to the county requesting that it be handed over to the association for distribution, or that it be distributed jointly. On the evening of the twenty-eighth, the association's chairman, Wang Jingting, dispatched vessels to rescue refugees coming to Yangzhou, totaling more than three hundred people. Except for those who were distributed to relatives and friends, thirty-seven people were admitted to the Changsheng Temple shelter. At the same time, merchants dispatched dozens of small boats to various ports to search for and rescue disaster victims and recover corpses. On the morning of the twenty-ninth, Chairman Wang also brought dozens of loads of relief grain and traveled to Gaoyou by ship to provide relief to disaster victims. In the afternoon, Vice Chairman Dai Tianqiu led four ships, carrying four hundred yuan, to the seventh and eighth districts to distribute emergency relief. All of the 1,771 yuan in national salvation funds allocated by the association for emergency relief was sent to the association by the county party department on the morning of the twenty-ninth. It is heard that, after expenses, one thousand yuan is being kept in custody by the Shengyuan Money Shop. At noon, the chairman and vice chairman of the Emergency Relief Association also telegraphed the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Association, the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, and other organizations to beg for relief. On the same day, the county government ordered the Grain Storage Association to provide three thousand yuan of accumulated grain funds for the Emergency Relief Association to use. As of the time the reporter submitted this manuscript, another one thousand several hundred refugees from Shaobo and Gaoyou had arrived, including several hundred who remained in shelters at Changsheng Temple and Zhizhu Temple. It is heard that there are still many refugees, and it is planned to send boats to transport them on the morning of the thirtieth.</p>
<p>Report on Relief and Disaster Survey by the Red Cross Society: Personnel from the relief team sent by the Red Cross Society to survey the disaster and provide relief, as well as personnel from the Huaiyang Charity Relief Association, returned to Yangzhou and reported that the ship could not proceed beyond Liuzha Gate. Ten-plus private boats were chartered and dragged through Kongjiawan straight down. The water at Majia Bridge was four or five feet deep. In addition, Gaofeng Bridge, Jijia Town, and Qiao Rescue Mound (with over two thousand disaster victims), Zengjiadu, Qiaoshu Town, and the Zhenwu Temple in the four countryside, Dinggou, Gaoqiao, Huanglizhuang, and Dingjiahuo (six thousand-plus households of disaster victims from Huanghualing), and Heifeng Xu with four thousand five hundred households, all suffered heavy disasters. Fields and houses were submerged, and a vast expanse of water could be seen. Corpses floated on the waves, and refugees on high ground looked forward to food like they were years old. According to the relief team's report upon returning to Yangzhou, the places affected by the water surge included Xinhekou, Diaojia Xu, Lijia Xu, Xiejiazhuang, Qianjiazhuang, Gejiazhuang, Wangjiakou, Xiajiazhuang, Daijiazhuang, Jizigou, Chenjiazhuang, Meijiazhuang, and Chenjiagou. Disaster victims were all sleeping in the open. The northwest lake area covered thousands of li, a vast expanse of water. All of the lake embankments were submerged. The breach locations included: fifteen or sixteen zhang east of Liuzha Gate, and thirteen or fourteen zhang north, all rushing towards the various counties inside the river. The Shaodi Jimaozhou South Dawang Temple was forty or fifty zhang. The Nanhétáng breach was three or four zhang, and the Nantangbian was three or four zhang. The Shi Embankment breach destroyed seven or eight out of ten rice markets. Zhuxiangkou, Guanyi, and Yan Matou destroyed the ancient Guandi Temple, Guanyi, and Public Security Bureau. Zhang Inspector's Enthusiastic Disaster Relief: Mr. Zhang Ruitang, sent by the Inspector's Office on the twenty-seventh to provide disaster relief in Shaobo and Gaoyou, has successively transported over a thousand refugees back, handing them over to Deputy Adjutant Song Bangrong, who dispatched personnel to care for them. A portion of them reside in Changsheng Temple, and food and drink are provided by the Deputy Adjutant's Office. On the morning of the twenty-ninth, Councilor Zhang Daorong and Deputy Adjutant Hu Daquan led a team of twenty-plus people, carrying food and eighteen private boats, to Xian Shao Gaoyou and other places to provide as much rescue as possible. In addition, Zhang Zhijiang and Zhang Shusheng have telegraphed Shanghai to beg for relief.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The breaches of the canal dikes in northern Jiangsu Province, the people who suffered, and the relief situation have been detailed in this newspaper. The following is a breakdown of the news received yesterday:</p>
<p>Cheng Jingsheng goes to Northern Jiangsu to Inspect the Work of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee: Mr. Cheng Jingsheng, a cadre of the working group of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, arrived in Zhen yesterday by night train with Yuan Xiaogu and other ten-plus people. They carried approximately thirty thousand yuan in cash and purchased dry food and medicine. They departed for Yangzhou, Shaobo, Xinghua, and Gaoyou that evening. Xu Jiatang, Shi Zhiying, Yang Dehuai, Guo Fuzeng, and others from the Provincial Government accompanied them. Zhu Qinglan also telegraphed, approving his arrival in Northern Jiangsu today for inspection. Ye Chucang, Chairman of the Provincial Government, Hu Pu'an, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Sun Hongzhe, Director of the Department of Construction, also plan to travel to the disaster areas of Gaoyou and Shaobo together.</p>
<p>Actual Situation after the Disaster in Shaobo: Since the Shaobo area experienced continuous strong winds and rain on the night of the twenty-fifth of this month, and the sudden dike breach occurred between 3:00 and 5:00 the next morning, the water spread. Lu Haishan, an inspector sent by the Department of Civil Affairs, brought dry food and rushed to investigate, and coordinated with County Magistrate Chen of Jiangdu to handle relief. Inspector Lu has now returned to the province to report, stating briefly that the water level has gradually receded in recent days, dropping more than four feet. Most of the disaster victims still wish to stay in their original locations and reorganize everything. The city of Jiangdu has set up five shelters, three of which are specifically for women and children. The disaster situation is more severe in Zhenwu Temple and Yangzhuang. Small boats have been hired to rescue people in batches, preparing to transport them to various locations in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang for resettlement. The main dam of Zhaoguan Dam has not collapsed, but the breach north of the dam is about one zhang long. The people in that area are urgently hoping that the breach will be blocked so that traffic can be restored as soon as possible, and hope that all sectors of society will provide sufficient food relief.</p>
<p>Li Mingyang telegraphs to report the disaster situation: Li Mingyang, Director of the Security Department, and Zhang Bin, an engineer from the Water Conservancy Bureau, went north together to investigate and sent a telegram stating briefly that north of Jieshou, except for the disaster victims scattered on the west bank, the situation on the east bank is very good. Passing through Shaobo Zhaoguan Dam, due to the large water flow, they could not land. The Huai River water is receding rapidly. The dangerous situation is not as severe as rumored. Postal and telegraph communications are not available. At 11:00 a.m., they arrived in Gaoyou and inspected on foot with local officials and gentry. Qigongdian and Longwang Temple were both washed away. Residents' houses outside the North Gate were flooded by several feet. He prays for the purchase of rice for relief.</p>
<p>Many breaches in the canal dike under repair: After the problems occurred in the Jiangbei Canal Dike, the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Department of Construction and its four affiliated offices have been extremely busy organizing emergency repairs, requisitioning labor, and transporting materials. The Jiangdu section was loaned a small boat from the Charity Relief Association by Director Shao to transport materials to the Shaobo area for repairs. Li Zhongqiang, the head of the Gaobao section's Public Works Office, only returned to Gaoyou yesterday to prepare for emergency repairs. It is heard that Sun Yiyi and other engineers from the Water Conservancy Bureau have recently telegraphed from Jieshou, stating that there are three breaches in the Gaoyou Dangjun Tower to Miaoxiangkou area, and more than ten problems in Yongsi Bao three flood control areas, which have been quickly repaired. They request the prompt sending of funds for relief. The Water Conservancy Bureau has continued to send multiple engineers, carrying ten thousand yuan in engineering funds, sacks, and many tools on the Fengyi boat to rush to the rescue, and has purchased two thousand branches of double-tung wood, loaded them on ships to await transport, and ordered Jiangdu County to seal up all firewood to prepare for construction use.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Charity Relief Association's telegram to Zhu Qinglan: General Zhu Jiangjun of Shanghai Yipinxiang and relayed to Chairman Xu Huangong Jian. Thank you for your telegram and for personally visiting the disaster area. In Shaoguan Town, the water has receded, and the corpses are exposed. The disaster victims are gathering. The water in the post has receded slightly, and the corpses piled up are shocking. It is unbearable to see. The disaster victims are sleeping in the open on city walls and temple roofs. The water flow is blocking the boats, making it difficult to provide relief. In addition to the two thousand-plus people already sheltered in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, many disaster victims are still holding onto their homeland and refusing to board boats. Straw mats are not available in time, and Inspector Zhang has been telegraphed to borrow military tents for local shelters. The cash carried is exhausted. Please send a continuation as soon as possible, Cheng Jingsheng is trapped.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Yellow River Water Level in Shandong Province is Alarming Again <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The Luokou water level rises by six inches, Liugong is extremely dangerous</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The water level of the Yellow River in Shandong Province, in the upper, middle, and lower reaches, has been declining for a week. However, today (the twenty-eighth), according to the water report from Shaanzhou, the water level has increased by six inches compared to a week ago, causing the water level in the upper reaches of Shandong Province to not decrease slightly, and the middle and lower reaches have also increased slightly as a result. According to today's Luokou water report, the Yellow River water level rose by six inches, with the water level 8 zhang 8 chi 6 cun above sea level. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Dongzhuang today, Director Zhang Lianjia of the River Affairs Bureau is still supervising construction in Juan territory. The seven weirs of the ten dams in Dongzhuang have been reinforced by two layers. The director will return to Jinan after the repairs are stable. The Heze Zinian has been measured, with a total length of four thousand two hundred zhang, and construction will begin within days. Furthermore, an urgent telegram from the Liuyuan section stated, "Director Zhang of the Jinan River Affairs Bureau, Section Chief Chen of the Shangshilibu Upstream Section, Qian, the dangerous situation of the Liugong has been repeatedly reported in telegrams. Now it is found that the large flow is currently impacting Dams 15, 16, and 17, with Dam 17 being the most affected. The water in front of the dam is more than three zhang deep. After the flow has impacted and scoured the dam, it is extremely dangerous. The section chief, together with the Nian Construction Bureau, has supervised soldiers and laborers to carry out emergency protection for five days and nights, raising two new sections of the embankment. Due to the tight flow and the lack of soil materials, repeated collapses have occurred. Fortunately, the soldiers and laborers have worked hard and bravely, and the situation has gradually stabilized, with the water level rising by four or five feet or more. The water in front of Dam 16 is one zhang seven or eight feet deep, and a new section of the dam has been raised, with the water level three feet higher. The dam sweep of the two dams was washed away by the flow early on. The Nian Construction Bureau has been constantly reporting this in telegrams. Recently, it has been observed that the base of the two dams is being impacted and scoured by the flow behind them, and the collapse is very rapid. The weirs should also be quickly installed to resist it. However, there is a lack of materials, which is very restrictive. In addition to urging the Nian Construction Bureau to quickly prepare, this telegram is being sent for your consideration and approval. Sincerely, Xu Desheng kowtows."</p>
<h3 id="e55">Urgent Relief Needed for the Jiujiang Flood <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Jiujiang News: The severity of this year's Jiujiang flood is unprecedented in decades. Jiujiang, located on the Yangtze River and backed by Mount Lu, experienced continuous rain in July, causing the river to rise sharply and mountain floods to erupt. The low-lying areas in Jiujiang city, including areas such as Longkai River outside Zhonglong and Xingzhou on the riverside, began to flood on July 12th. At that time, the customs water level was only 40 feet. By the 18th, the mountain floods had further increased, and the Longkai River was blocked by the Yangtze River, unable to flow out, causing it to overflow its banks. Teahouses, restaurants, brothels, opium dens, inns, villas, and theaters of all kinds, clustered along the first, second, and third roads, were all flooded. On that day, the customs water level was 41.6 feet, on the 19th it was 41.8 feet, and on the 20th it was 42 feet. At that time, the streets and alleys along Gan Tang Lake were more than a foot deep in water. After that, the water level gradually increased. By July 29th, the entire prosperous commercial area of the city, namely the western section of Da Zhong Road, was completely submerged. All other places near the riverbanks and lakesides were filled with water. Shopkeepers opened their doors every day to watch the water, residents with multi-story houses moved to higher floors, and those without such houses relocated. The water has not receded even slightly to this day.</p>
<p>The entire Jiujiang county is divided into nine districts. The city is the first district, and the eighth and ninth districts are north of the Yangtze River. All the dikes and embankments have been breached in more than 30 places since July 27th, turning the area into a vast expanse of water. Even the highest points are five feet deep. Half of Jiujiang's essence is gone. The seventh district in Jiangnan suffered the most, being completely submerged with only rooftops visible. Most of the fourth and sixth districts have disappeared. The second and fifth districts are mostly mountainous and, although not directly affected by the river, have accumulated water reaching several inches in the lowest areas. In total, over 120 breaches in dikes and embankments have occurred throughout the county, affecting a disaster area of 3,710 square li. More than 154,000 people have been affected, and approximately 244,200 mu of farmland have been flooded, resulting in losses of approximately 7,327,000 yuan. More than 15,820 houses have been destroyed, resulting in losses of approximately 4,746,000 yuan. More than 1,810 people have drowned, and livestock losses are estimated at 344,000 yuan. The total losses are around 12,420,000 yuan, a disaster unprecedented in its magnitude. The commercial losses in the city are not included in this figure. The river and mountain floods are still rising today, and the scale of the future catastrophe is unknown.</p>
<p>In terms of relief efforts, after the most important dike in the ninth district north of the Yangtze River, named Pan Xing Dike, collapsed on August 1st, the Flood Relief Committee was established on the 2nd. Work was assigned, staff introduced, and documents processed on the 3rd, keeping everyone busy. On the 7th, the standing committee members Yuan Dinghua, Jiang Junyang, Wang Shirong, and Ye Chongru went to the provincial government to request relief funds and were approved for 3,000 yuan, which has not yet been received. At the beginning of August, there were few disaster victims coming to Xun city. Those who came either stayed with relatives and friends or rented temporary housing. These were the relatively wealthy. Later, more and more people came, with nowhere to be accommodated, scattering in empty spaces, creating a very tragic situation. Only after mid-month did they begin to provide porridge, but there was not enough to go around, so the well-fed were still full, and the hungry were still hungry. Based on the current economic situation, if no more relief funds arrive, they can maintain it until mid-September at most. Shelters have never been established, and disaster victims are sleeping outdoors and eating the wind, resulting in many deaths.</p>
<p>Oxen are one of the farmers' assets. When the flood came, farmland and houses could not be moved, but oxen could be led to escape. At the beginning of August, farmers bringing oxen to the city were unable to feed them and had to sell them cheaply to religious groups for slaughter with tears in their eyes. Oxen worth 70 or 80 yuan each could only be exchanged for a little over 10 yuan. Charitable people who only eat beef after slaughtering oxen showed great compassion and raised a fund of 2,000 yuan to establish a temporary oxen pawnshop. Each oxen was pawned for up to 10 yuan, and the shop hired people to graze them, allowing the farmers to redeem them at the original price in the future. This news spread, and people flocked to pawn their oxen. The pawn price was reduced from 10 to 5 yuan per oxen, and the capital was exhausted in a few days. Those who came later were still forced to enter the butcher's doors. (August 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e56">He and Chen Go to Nanchang to Meet Chiang <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Forward Headquarters and Commander of the Left Wing, and Chen Mingshu, Commander of the Right Wing, have been directing their troops to suppress bandits since their departure two months ago. All important bandit lairs have been successively recovered. After General Chiang returned to Jiangxi from the capital yesterday, he specially summoned He and Chen to the province to inquire about the recent battles and bandit situation, and to give them instructions in person. He and Chen, upon receiving the order, arrived in Nanchang on the 26th and visited Chiang at the headquarters one after another. He reported on the distribution of the Red bandits, their tendency to flee and cause disturbances, and the progress of the government's suppression efforts in Guangchang, Ningdu, Shicheng, Lean, and Yudu in southeastern Jiangxi and the border areas of Jiangxi and Fujian. Chen reported on the operations and progress of the suppression efforts in Ji'an, Yongfeng, Taihe, and Xingguo in southwestern Jiangxi. Chiang expressed his great satisfaction, and in addition to giving instructions in person, he also discussed future combat plans, joint advances, and methods of eradication. He and Chen stayed in the province briefly and then returned to the front separately.</p>
<p>It is said that General Chiang has newly formulated a bandit suppression plan. Wherever the troops go, they will completely eradicate all scattered bandits in that area, complete the household registration survey, organize a sound militia, and transform all bad elements into good citizens, without any bandits hiding among them. Only then will they advance further. (August 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Liu Guitang's Troops Arrive in Juancheng <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Gu Liangmin Goes to Intercept Them</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Guitang, the notorious, led his remaining troops of more than 500 men to Guancheng and Fanxian in western Shandong on the 26th, and then crossed the river from Pu county and fled towards Caozhou. Today (28th), the provincial government received another telegram from Liang Zaiqi, the magistrate of Juancheng county (a new county established by splitting Pu county on the south bank of the Yellow River), reporting that Liu Guitang had led his remaining troops to the vicinity west of the county seat. They refused to let him enter the city, and he immediately went south, requesting that the troops not pursue too hastily to avoid him entering the city. The current militia and public security bureau did not engage with Liu's troops.</p>
<p>Another report states that Liu Guitang's remaining troops broke into Yuhuangmiao and Xutang in Yuncheng on the morning of the 27th. They were fiercely surrounded and attacked by the Juancheng militia, and the bandit forces were unable to resist and fled towards Shuibu Liangshan. Gu Liangmin, commander of the 22nd Division, arrived at the junction of Yuncheng and Juye on the morning of the 27th to intercept the fleeing bandit troops. Rong Guangxing, commander of the 87th Brigade stationed in Liaocheng, also telegraphed Sun Tongxuan, the commander-in-chief of the Second Army Corps, today (28th), reporting that 200 to 300 of Liu's remaining troops suddenly broke into the Shawo area, more than 30 li north of Tangyi city. He has ordered Li's regiment of the 87th Brigade and the Tangyi militia to attack them. Li Xuande, the commander of the cavalry brigade, arrived in Pu county, and Chen Dexin, the commander of the 86th Brigade, arrived in Guancheng to direct the troops to suppress the bandits separately. According to Sun Tongxuan, the commander-in-chief of the Second Army Corps, Liu's remaining troops are no more than 700 men, harassing Yuncheng, Juye, Chaocheng, Guancheng, and Caozhou. Gu Liangmin, commander of the 22nd Division, Chen Dexin, commander of the 86th Brigade, Rong Guangxing, commander of the 87th Brigade, and Li Xuande, commander of the cavalry brigade, are currently supervising their respective units and the militias of various counties to actively suppress and attack the bandits. They should be completely eradicated within ten days. It is said that Han Fuqu has also telegraphed Sun Tongxuan and Li Shuchun, ordering them to strictly block and attack Liu's bandits. However, Gu Liangmin also sent a telegram to Sun Tongxuan and others yesterday, reporting on the recent situation of bandit suppression in western Shandong. The telegram reads: "To Commander Sun Tongxuan and Commander Cao Fulin of Qing, greetings. Your telegrams of Chen Wu are noted. Zi Mi, I led my troops to the junction of Ju and Yun on the day of Gan to intercept the enemy and ordered them to defend. According to reports from the Yuncheng militia, Liu Hei Qi led his troops of approximately 500 men into Yuhuangmiao and Xutang in Yuncheng. I immediately led my troops to attack, killing over 20 bandits and wounding dozens. The bandit forces were unable to resist and fled towards Shuibu Liangshan, and so on. I am reporting this. Your respectful servant, Gu Liangmin, bows." (August 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Chen Diaoyuan Goes to Wuhan to Meet Chiang <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhenhua Accompanying</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Chen Diaoyuan, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, went to the capital from Anhui a few days ago, intending to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang, report on the military affairs of bandit suppression, and request instructions on financial issues after the flood. However, Chiang had already returned to Jiangxi and he was unable to meet him. Therefore, at 6:00 AM on the 28th, he accompanied Liu Zhenhua, the Pacification Commissioner of Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, and Yan Zhuang, the Anhui-Jiangxi Relief Committee member of the Executive Yuan, and took the Jiangshun steamer back to Anhui. Liu and Yan stayed at the provincial government, while Chen took a car to Jixianguan at 7:00 AM on the 29th to inspect the military officer training corps. He returned to the city at noon. He happened to receive a telegram from the Nanchang camp informing him that Chairman Chiang had left Jiangxi for Wuhan to inspect the disaster area. Chen then took the Wu-Da special steamer to Wuhan with Liu Zhenhua at 7:00 PM to meet Chiang. All of the chairman's duties were performed by Liu Fu, the provincial committee's concurrent secretary-general. It is said that Chen will return to Anhui within a few days. After Yan Jiang arrived in Anhui, he had already discussed emergency relief measures with the provincial government. He will go to Jiangxi again in a few days. It is also heard that the Central Government has allocated 170,000 yuan for Anhui's disaster relief, which Yan has already received in the capital and deposited temporarily in the China-South Bank in the capital, to be remitted to Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Hao county, and other bank offices when needed, so that it can be withdrawn and used at any time.

<h3 id="e59">Changsha's Finance Returns to Normal <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Reason: Withdrawal of Guangdong-Guangxi Armies</p>
<p>Hengbao Areas Also Lifted Martial Law</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The rumors of the Guangdong-Guangxi armies' plot to invade Hunan have subsided, and the border defenses of Hunan have transitioned from tension to peace. Martial law in Hengzhou and Baoqing has been lifted. Looking back to half a month ago, due to the increasing rumors of Guangdong and Guangxi plotting to invade Hunan, various banks and money houses transported cash to Shanghai and Hankou, causing a financial panic due to the lack of cash in the market. Interest rates in the market increased, with the interest on every 1,000 yuan rising to 20 yuan every half month, and Shanghai notes falling to 97 (only worth 97 yuan per 100 yuan), an unprecedented anomaly in the Changsha market. Since the withdrawal of the Guangdong-Guangxi armies, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have successively transported hundreds of thousands of yuan of cash from Hankou, and the interest rate has fallen from 20 yuan to 7 yuan, and Shanghai notes have risen from 97 to 98.5. The financial situation in the market has returned to normal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, He Jian received a report from Yongzhou stating that Zhang Gui's army had all returned to Pingle, Gongcheng, and Guilin, and there were no signs of plotting to invade Hunan for the time being. He Jian reported this to General Chiang, He Yingqin, He Chengjun, and others. The telegram reads as follows: "(1) I have just received a telegram from Yongzhou reporting that Wu Qiwai's division of Zhang Fakui's troops has moved from Longhuguan and Xilingzhai to Ping (Le) Gong (Cheng). Another regiment has moved to Guilin. Wei Yunzhong and Huang Heling's two divisions have moved from Pinggong to the Wuxun area. Li Pinxian's division has one regiment stationed in Guilin, and the rest have moved to Pingle. Han Caifeng's division has moved to Liuzhou Changping. Tan Lianfang's battalion is stationed on the west bank of the Huangsha River. There are no troops stationed in Meixikou and Guanyang. (2) The Guangxi army is composed of 20,000 newly recruited soldiers who have not completed two months of training. Half of them will be kept for future recruitment, and the rest will be transported to Guangdong. It is said that they are tricking Chen Jitang into providing them with weapons, but he has only promised to allocate 1,000 rifles, which have not yet arrived. Recently, many new recruits have deserted from various units. (3) Li Zongren stayed in Guangdong, and Zhang Fakui stayed in Hong Kong, and both have not returned to Guangxi. Bai Chongxi has also recently gone from Guangxi to Wu, and there are currently no signs of plotting to invade Guangdong or Hunan." I especially report. Your respectful servant, He Jian, bows.</p>
<p>When the rumors of the Guangdong-Guangxi armies' plot to invade Hunan reached Hunan, He Jian had transferred all of Tao Guang's 31st Division to Hengzhou for defense. Now that the situation has eased, He Jian has ordered Tao's division to transfer a brigade to Gongyou to cooperate with Jiangxi Lianhua in suppressing Li Mingrui's bandits. (August 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Female Aviator Ms. Yederu Arrives in Shenyang <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Comparable to Amy Johnson</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: German female aviator Ms. Yederu, after departing from Germany via Siberia, arrived in Harbin on the 25th and left Harbin at 3 PM on the 26th for Shenyang. The Aviation Command, after receiving a report from Zen Chen Foreign Company stating that Ms. Ye would arrive today, immediately prepared to receive her. Later, due to cloudy and rainy weather, they were concerned that she would not be able to arrive as scheduled. It wasn't until 5 PM that the German Consulate received a confirmed telegram stating that Ye had left Harbin and, barring any obstacles en route, would arrive in Shenyang at around 6 PM. The Consulate immediately notified overseas Chinese in Shenyang and our government officials. The Aviation Command dispatched staff member Xu Shangzhang, translator Li Cunxin, and technician Jiang Changying to be responsible for the reception. At around 5 PM, Yu Lianzuo, secretary of the European and American Section of the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office, the German Consul-General stationed in Liaoning, various overseas merchants, and reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers rushed to the venue in the rain to welcome her. At 5:50 PM, a black dot appeared in the northwestern sky. German overseas merchants took off their hats and cheered wildly, and the atmosphere was immediately enthusiastic. Soon after, the sound of the engine was heard. In about five minutes, the plane landed safely on the field. The German Consul and overseas merchants rushed forward to push the plane and presented flowers. The plane was a yellow, single-winged Junkers A50 model with 88 and 8/10 horsepower. Ms. Ye was wearing a yellow leather flying suit, goggles, and yellow leather shoes. Her complexion was tan, indicating that she had endured wind and frost. After disembarking, she shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with the crowd. The Chinese side presented a cup of champagne as a tribute and expressed their condolences. Ms. Ye smiled and thanked them. She then went to the Aviation Command's reception room to rest and have refreshments. She was then hosted by the German Consul and lodged in the German Club on Er Jing Liu Wei Road. It is said that Ms. Ye traveled from Germany to Shenyang in seven days, covering a distance of 34,000 kilometers. She plans to leave Shenyang on the 27th and go to Tokyo. After staying for one or two days, she will return to our country, pass through Shanghai and Qingdao, and then go to India and return home. Ms. Ye is following in the footsteps of Amy Johnson by flying alone to Shenyang, and her achievements are comparable, which is highly valued by all parties. It can also stimulate people's interest in aviation. (August 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Memorial Service for Overseas Chinese in Korea <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>77th Day Since Overseas Chinese Were Killed</p>
<p>Survivors Shed Tears Together</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: Korean thugs recently massacred overseas Chinese, resulting in an unprecedented bloody tragedy. The 77th day since the tragic deaths of the overseas Chinese has already passed, but this major tragedy seems to have faded into oblivion. Not only has it failed to inspire the patriotism of the Chinese people, but the hundreds of overseas Chinese who died tragically will have difficulty finding peace under the Nine Springs. Recently, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the capital, in order to commemorate the tragically deceased overseas Chinese and to arouse the patriotism of the Chinese people, designated the 22nd of this month as the 77th day since the tragic deaths of the overseas Chinese, and held a large-scale memorial service to express grief. After the Chamber of Commerce proposed this idea, the overseas Chinese in Korea unanimously sympathized with it. Therefore, on the 22nd, the Chinese Chambers of Commerce in Incheon, Pyongyang, Wonsan, Sinuiju, and other places all held memorial services for the deceased overseas Chinese. All the surviving overseas Chinese in Korea shed tears together. According to a guest returning from Sinuiju, the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Sinuiju, Mr. Han, received a special letter from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the capital five days ago notifying him to hold a memorial service. He immediately began preparations. On the morning of the 22nd, the memorial service was held in the auditorium of the Chinese Commercial Primary School. In the center of the auditorium were portraits and wills of General Sun Yat-sen and party and national flags. Below, on a table, were arranged the spiritual tablets of the deceased overseas Chinese, about two feet high, inscribed with "Spiritual Tablets of the Deceased Overseas Chinese in Korea". In front of the offering table were arranged incense burners, candlesticks, clear wine, and vegetarian dishes. On both sides were hung wreaths and elegiac couplets. At this time, 600 to 700 overseas Chinese came uninvited. At about 10:00 AM, the meeting began according to the scheduled ceremony. Chairman Han gave the opening address, and Consul Zhu took the stage to give a speech that was tragic and moving. Other guests also gave speeches separately, their words were extremely sad. It wasn't until about 1:00 PM that the meeting was adjourned. Although the Japanese police station did not object to the meeting on the surface, they paid special attention to it, so they dispatched several plainclothes patrol officers to the venue to monitor it.

<p>Nanhui</p>
<p>Violent Winds and Rain Cause Disaster: On the evening of August 25th, violent winds and rain ravaged Nanhui County. The cotton and rice fields in the county were blown by the wind and rain, and the cotton bolls and yellow flowers were all knocked down, and the rice grains were damaged and looked desolate. Along the coast of the county, the embankments in the group districts were broken in more than 20 places by the tide. The Huijiao Dike in the fifth district was also broken in more than 20 zhang. A Wanghai tower guarding against pirates was also blown down. The thatched houses of poor farmers along the coast were all destroyed. East of Wangtang, the water is about four feet deep, and many farmers have nowhere to live. It is now known that the district chiefs, Zhang Yiyi and others, have reported to the county government one after another, requesting that measures be taken for relief. A Record of the Trial of an Evil Prank Case: The case of a wife's adultery and a husband's evil prank that occurred on North Gate Street in this city has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Mei Qiushi could not be treated by the Public First Hospital and was transferred to the Shanghai Labor Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and she has died. Yesterday, the county government opened a trial of this case. Judge Lu presided over the trial. First, Mei Kui-ru, the husband of Mei Qiushi, was questioned. (Question) Why did you insert an iron bar into your wife Qiushi's lower body? (Answer) There was no such thing. That night, I wanted to sleep with her, but she refused, so we had a verbal argument and a scuffle. (Question) Where did the blood all over the bed come from? (Answer) It was really because she was having her period. (Question) Your wife is now dead, do you know that? (Answer) I know that. Her coffin has already been brought back from Shanghai. I am really wronged in this matter. I beg for a clear investigation. Then, Zhang Qiushi, the elder sister of Mei, and Zhao Shenshi, the mother of Mei, were questioned. It was said that this case was reported by you and others. Now, the father is requesting that the case be withdrawn. How much money did you get from Mei Kui-ru? They replied that they did not get any money. They really pitied him for being so miserable, so they voluntarily withdrew the case. At this point, Mei Kui-ru was ordered to be detained for further investigation and determination.</p>

<p>Continued Report on the Story of a Patrol Officer Demanding Pay and Insulting the District Chief: Yesterday (29th), the story of a patrol officer from the Fourth Precinct of this city demanding pay and insulting the district chief was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the police expenses of the Fourth Precinct of the city have always been insufficient to cover the expenses. Moreover, since August of last year, more than ten additional police officers have been added, further increasing police expenses. At that time, the salaries of the detectives of the County Public Security Bureau were also paid separately by the First District Office from the housing police donation item on a monthly basis. However, the County Bureau's own expenses were also insufficient to cover the expenses. Therefore, from the 19th year of the Republic of China, the county magistrate ordered the First District Office to allocate funds from the housing police donation item. However, the First District's housing police donation revenue was limited, and it was really unable to cope with the heavy burden. This time, two-thirds of the Fourth Precinct's police pay for July has been paid, and there is still a small amount left. They originally planned to borrow money from the bank yesterday to cope with it. Unexpectedly, the patrol officer and others, without asking the reason, cleverly induced District Chief Zhong to go to the Public Security Bureau and placed him under house arrest, subjecting him to all kinds of insults. After repeated explanations, they turned a deaf ear. At that time, the Bureau Chief was at the side but did not stop them, which was very strange. Later, the First District Office staff reported to the County Magistrate, who telegraphed the Bureau Chief to stop them, and he was released back to the office. It is now heard that the County Government will severely punish the Bureau Chief and the Patrol Officer for condoning their subordinates, insulting the District Chief, and having no ability to control them. District Chief Zhong, who has suffered this strange insult, is said to be preparing a written report of the incident to the Chamber of Commerce and the shopkeepers who pay the donation, seeking public opinion.</p>
<p>County Government Grain Storage Conference: The Civil Affairs Department specially dispatched Commissioner Wu Xie to Songjiang in order to prepare for the grain storage in various counties to replenish their stocks. He once convened a meeting with the food management committee and convened leaders of the County Party Department, various agencies, and district chiefs at the County Government a few days ago. County Magistrate Shen presided over the meeting. Commissioner Wu reported on the main intentions of the Civil Affairs Department, which were to not allow the accumulation of money for grain storage and to expand and recover the methods of transfer and misappropriation. Matters discussed: (1) It was resolved to spend all the accumulated money to purchase white rice for storage within the time limit stipulated by the Civil Affairs Department. (2) It was resolved that A. Starting from the busy season of the 21st year of the Republic of China, two cents per mu will be levied. B. Various stores will donate one-thousandth of their capital amount based on the business tax survey. The Chamber of Commerce will notify them. C. Following the Jinshan method, one sheng of rice per mu will be assigned from the ripe fields, and the landlords will collect it from the farmers to offset the rent. D. Items B and C will be limited to one year for the time being. Detailed measures will be submitted to the County Government Conference for review. (3) The County Government will follow orders to investigate and recover the grain storage funds that have been withdrawn for military expenses and other expenses over the years.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Raises Disaster Relief Funds: The County Chamber of Commerce held a regular meeting yesterday to discuss matters. Regarding the floods in various places, the Chamber of Commerce decided to raise funds for relief from various businesses and shops. At the same time, they will send representatives to Shanghai to contact the Flood Relief Association to distribute the funds on their behalf. A corrected version of the Chamber of Commerce's budget for the 20th year of the Republic of China was passed and submitted to the Supervisory Committee for review and implementation.</p>

<p>Losses from Hurricane and Rainstorm: Since entering the summer, this county has experienced prolonged rain, and the lake water has risen sharply, causing great losses to the fields. The day before yesterday (26th), it was hit by a hurricane and rainstorm, resulting in the fields being washed away and many houses being destroyed. The losses this time were greater than during the prolonged rain. Therefore, in recent days, dozens of villagers have come to the city to report the disaster. It is feared that the autumn harvest this year will be greatly affected.</p>

<p>Difficulties in Establishing Disaster Relief Shelters: The provincial government telegraphed the Nantong County Government to quickly prepare disaster relief shelters for the disaster victims of various counties north of the Yangtze River along the canal. The Dongtai County Chamber of Commerce urgently telegraphed the Nantong County Chamber of Commerce to quickly release ships to rescue the disaster victims from danger. In addition to ordering the Chamber of Commerce to release ships and find houses, County Magistrate Zhang telegraphed the local situation to the provincial government, stating that Nantong's flood disaster was no less severe than the various counties along the canal. Moreover, people were drowned by the wind and tide, and it was right after the bandit chaos, and they were struggling to raise relief funds. According to reports from various groups, the pacification army and the wounded soldiers' factories of the 11th Division are stationed there, and there are really no empty houses to accommodate them. They requested that another place with less damage be selected to set up shelters for resettlement.</p>
<p>Severe Tidal Disaster in Liu Hai Sandbar: Due to the sudden rise of the Yangtze River tide to one zhang and eight chi, the tide broke through the various embankments in Liu Hai Sandbar, Nantong, submerging more than 700 households, killing more than 300 people, and affecting more than 5,000 disaster victims. The county government is rushing to provide emergency relief.</p>
<p>Resolution of Sandbar Case Dispute: Nantong Men's and Women's Normal Schools reported claiming 3,000 mu of sandbar and had a dispute with the Dingxing Case representatives. After more than five years of disputes, the dispute was mediated by Chen Baochu and others, and the two schools priced the beach land at 40,000 yuan to end the dispute.</p>

He also captured a bandit named Fang Laoliu. He has now been brought to the county for questioning and has confessed the hiding places of several key criminals, including Xu. The police have been secretly ordered to arrest them. The Twelfth District Chief Accused: Chen Hao, the district chief of the Twelfth District, is accused of being biased and unaccommodating in his handling of affairs. The people of the district, Wang Yinglong and others, have gone to the province to report him.

<p>County Government Distributes Urgent Relief in Zhenjiang County. The county government of Zhenjiang has received successive reports from districts 157 that dikes have broken, and livestock and houses have been swept away by the waves. Disaster victims are either clinging to tree branches or on dikes, urgently needing relief. County Magistrate Zhang has already raised 2,000 yuan and personally set off this morning to distribute relief. The Zhenjiang Red Swastika Society, considering the severe disaster situation in Huangni Township, had previously dispatched personnel by boat to transport a large amount of dry food for relief. According to the relief workers returning to the city, the water level in the township is level with the houses, and many disaster victims are living on rooftops and high ridges, supporting the old and carrying the young, a truly tragic sight. The Zhenjiang County Disaster Relief Committee has been renamed the Zhenjiang County Relief Branch yesterday. As for the disaster relief in this county, the Jiangsu Flood Disaster Relief Association has entrusted the temporary Jiangbei Flood Disaster Relief Association to take charge of everything nearby.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Disaster Area: Boats Rescue Disaster Victims. The scale of this Jiangbei flood is truly unprecedented. Although the severity of the disaster in various places has been repeatedly reported in newspapers, inquiries from various sources have led to diverse and unclear information. It is now reliably reported that the wind has subsided and the tide has receded in the area, and the situation is stable. Shaobo Town has been 70% submerged. There is still no news from Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, and Funing. Yesterday, the provincial government dispatched six boats, towing civilian boats loaded with dry food and relief funds, to various disaster-stricken counties for relief. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce recently received an urgent telegram from Qingjiangpu, requesting boats for rescue. It is reported that over two hundred workers from the Commercial Post and Flour Mill have escaped to Zhenjiang. It is said that Gaoyou has not been completely submerged. Small steamers between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang are all being used for disaster relief. However, information is blocked from counties along the Xiangxia River, and transportation is cut off. If maritime charitable organizations could provide boats for rescue in the disaster area, it would be truly meritorious.</p>

<p>The Right to Manage the Chen Gong Ancestral Hall Property Has Been Determined. The ancestral property of Chen Guorui's ancestral hall, a famous general of the Qing Dynasty, is located in Minjiaqiao Town, Huxi, Gaoyou County. Previously, it was managed by local gentry appointed by the county government. The rent from the ancestral fields was used for the repair and maintenance of the ancestral hall and its sacrificial ceremonies, with the remaining funds allocated to the county's education expenses. However, in recent years, a descendant of Chen Gong, Chen Dazhi, suddenly disputed the ownership of the ancestral fields. The Jiangsu Provincial Government ruled that the ancestral fields belonged to the ancestral hall. Since the management rights were not determined, Chen Dazhi, based on the order that the fields belonged to the ancestral hall, requested the judicial administration office to recover the ancestral fields and hand them over to the Hubei Fellow Villagers Association for management. The various agencies of this county disagreed with the decision of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and petitioned the Ministry of Interior, requesting a determination of the management rights. Now, the county government has received an order from the provincial government forwarding a decision from the Ministry of Interior. The main points are: (To supplement the decision of the Jiangsu Provincial Government that the ancestral property of Chen Guorui's ancestral hall belongs to the ancestral hall, a board of directors should be organized according to law to manage it, supervised by the Gaoyou County Government. The profits should be used for sacrificial ceremonies and annual repairs of the ancestral hall, with the remaining funds allocated to the county's education expenses.)</p>

<p>The Department of Finance Borrows Another 700,000 Yuan from Banks. The Zhejiang Department of Finance is facing empty provincial coffers and a shortage of financial resources. Despite repeated borrowing to maintain operations, it is still insufficient to cope with expenses. With the end of the month approaching, military and political expenses are long overdue, and demands for allocation are urgent. Department Director Wang Chengying has negotiated with the banking sector to borrow funds, including 500,000 yuan from the Bank of China in Hangzhou and 200,000 yuan from the Shanghai Siming Bank, using 1.2 million yuan in old outstanding public bonds as collateral, with a monthly interest rate of 1.2%. An agreement has been reached with the authorities of both banks, and the contract was signed yesterday for the actual transfer of funds.</p>
<p>The Verdict on the Appeal of a Murder Case. The case of Shaoxing farmers Shen Changyou and others for murder has been concluded after the initial judgment by the local branch court and subsequent appeal and trial in Hangzhou. Yesterday, Shen Changyou was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for the crime of jointly plotting murder, with two days of detention counting as one day of imprisonment. The trial procedures for Shen Qian, Shen Shunfeng, Zhou Chunfa, and others were suspended.</p>

<p>Statistics on the Disaster Situation in Jiaxing. Jiaxing previously suffered a disaster due to continuous rain, and all the crops were submerged. Although farmers tried their best to drain the water, the results were minimal. The county government repeatedly received telegrams from district offices, village and neighborhood associations, township farmers' associations, and villagers reporting the disaster situation. They dispatched personnel to various townships for on-site investigation, which has now been completed. A total of 2,509 households have been affected in the county, with 12,658 people affected. 21,018 mu of fields have been destroyed. It is estimated that the autumn harvest will be reduced by about 50%. The county is now compiling a list to report to the province for review.</p>
<p>Demolition of the Qianxi Dang Fish Weir. The Xinyi Company in Shuangqiao District, Jiaxing, had built weirs in Qianjia Dang, which were strong and obstructed the flow of water. Local villagers petitioned the county government to send personnel to demolish them. County Magistrate Liang and Director of the Construction Bureau personally went to the countryside to investigate and confirmed the facts, and submitted a report to the Construction Department for approval. The Construction Department has now ordered the county to demolish them. Therefore, the county government yesterday dispatched District Chief Mei Shuren, together with Police Chief Gao, leading police officers, to quickly demolish all the weirs built by Xinyi Company in Qianjia Dang.</p>

Chen Shizhong, the head of the Fenghua Zuoxikeng Self-Defense Corps, received a report on the 26th that Sun Libiao, a bandit leader pursued by the First Battalion of the Sheng County Security Team, would likely flee into Fenghua. He led over ten members of the corps, including Wang Qizheng, to block the Tangwu Ridge on the border of Sheng and Fenghua. Around 3:00 AM that night, over forty bandits approached from the ridge road. The corps members shouted inquiries, and the bandits immediately opened fire. The corps members returned fire for ten minutes, and the bandits fled in all directions. One bandit was killed on the spot, and a Browning pistol was found on the bandit's body. On the afternoon of the 27th, the bandit's body was taken to the city for inspection.</p>

The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association and the Shaoxing Fellow Villagers Association, considering the severe flooding in Hankou, previously dispatched two ships, the Xinning and the Xinghan, to Hankou to transport disaster victims back to their ancestral homes in Ningbo and Shaoxing. The Xinning ship set sail on the morning of the 26th, heading directly to Ningbo, and arrived last night at 8:00 PM, carrying over a thousand passengers. All their fares, food expenses, and wine expenses were waived. The Xinghan ship will depart today and is expected to arrive on the 31st.</p>

<p>(3) In terms of level, it should be divided into several grades. The lowest grade is equivalent to elementary school. As mentioned in the previous article, this is of course a special situation in China. However, even for the elementary level, a part of the teaching materials suitable for children under the age of ten should be removed, and vocational training should be added. The elementary grade is equivalent to senior elementary school, the intermediate grade is equivalent to junior high school, and the advanced grade is equivalent to senior high school. These three grades can be said to be the mainstream of remedial education. Beyond this, there is also the highest grade, which is equivalent to the first and second years of vocational school. It seems appropriate to prepare all five grades to meet the needs of all parties in society. If it is further expanded, such as night universities and academic lectures, it will be almost equivalent to part of the university curriculum.</p>
<p>This is the remedial education I advocate, which can exert great power and solve the difficult problems of Chinese education.</p>
<p>Let us try to calmly observe the actual situation in China. Does the general society feel that school education is too unsuitable for China's economic and social conditions? A middle school student costs two to three hundred yuan a year, and a university student costs four to five hundred yuan a year. How can a middle-class family afford it? If they can't afford it but insist on doing it, it's no wonder there are complaints everywhere. Not to mention those who study, who are full of complaints, even those who run schools, because public and private finances are very difficult, are also frowning and sighing. We have personally seen many talented students who could indeed be cultivated into outstanding talents, but because their families are poor and unable to support them, they cannot continue to advance after graduating from elementary school, and they cannot continue to study after graduating from middle school. Is this not a great loss to the country? At the same time, there is also a group of young people with not very high qualifications who, because of the instigation of vanity, become groups of people going to those boring universities. After four years of studying and spending thousands of dollars, they are still unemployed. Is this not a great danger to the country? Middle school education is aimed at preparing for further education, but the universities they are admitted to are like this. Year after year, many university graduates are produced, spread in society, bumping around, and no one cares about them anymore. Those who graduate from middle school and do not go to university are not willing to lower their ambitions and learn agriculture, engineering, or commerce. If they are unwilling to learn, they are also bumping around in society, and no one cares about them even more. Fortunately, vocational education has been promoted by the government and advocated by the society. However, school equipment requires money, and teachers take time to train. How can many be established at once? Even if many are established, how can they all be run well at once? (Distant water cannot quench near thirst) What should we do? Is this not the real situation in Chinese society today?</p>
<p>I will not avoid being verbose and will further explain separately from the perspectives of urban and rural areas. In urban areas, among the workers and apprentices in factories or shops who have graduated from elementary or junior high school and are aspiring to advance but have no opportunity, there are indeed more and more every day. This group of young people can be regarded as social producers. They are willing to study in their spare time, which does not cost their parents a penny. Unfortunately, the country and society do not have many appropriate educational institutions to meet their needs. This is so pitiful. In rural areas, elementary schools are currently as rare as morning stars, so very few people are literate. However, a group of young people around the age of twenty who are engaged in farming have leisure time to sit in teahouses and wander around idly, and sometimes they also feel the pain of being illiterate and having no knowledge. They are willing to read and open their eyes, but there are not many appropriate educational institutions now, which makes them forever fall into the dark world. This is also so pitiful.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education ordered the reporting of the trial implementation of the new local education administrative system. In addition to ordering all trial areas directly under the Executive Yuan, it also issued a general order to the education departments of all provinces, saying: "Recently, various local education administrative agencies have been trying out new systems for the organization of local education administration, such as the central elementary school system and provincial, municipal, and county counseling conferences. Their impact on local education is not insignificant. However, the Ministry of Education urgently wants to know the details of the trial implementation of these systems, including how the measures are implemented, what the regulations are, what preparations were made before the trial, what difficulties were encountered during the trial, what achievements were made after the trial, and whether they can be universally promoted throughout the country, so as to provide a reference for improving the national local education administration. If the education department and its subordinate counties and cities are trying out this system, they should submit a detailed report separately within the shortest possible time and send it to the Ministry of Education for verification and handling."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the report submitted by the Gansu Education Department forwarding the enrollment list of students in the four-two system pre-service normal school general course of the Provincial Sixth Normal School, requested review and approval for record. The Ministry of Education instructed: "The submitted report is acknowledged. After checking the qualifications of the students listed in the school's report, there are no discrepancies. Approval is granted for record. However, the name 'pre-service normal school general course' is not appropriate. According to the regulations for normal schools, they should enroll junior high school graduates and provide them with three years of training. If it is for cultivating rapid-training teachers, they should enroll senior elementary school graduates and provide them with several years of training, which can be called a 'several-year system teacher training class.' Please instruct the school to comply with this and change the class to a 'four-year system teacher training class.'"</p>

<p>The Overseas Chinese Middle School in Surabaya, Dutch East Indies, was founded by Zhang Ji'an, the president of the local Chamber of Commerce, and other gentry and merchants such as Li Shuanghui, Ye Renshui, Lin Shengdi, Ye Danwu, and Lin Qingfen.

<p>China is Likely to Maintain its Lead</p>
<p>Yesterday's Doubles Result: 3-1 Victory over Japan</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Showed Great Potential, Jiang Daozhang's Amazing Masterpiece</p>
<p>Forecast of Each Winning One Group in Today's Singles Match</p>
<p>Widespread Panic - Can't All Rely on the Sun - The ultimate decision of whether this year's Rotary Cup International Tennis Championship belongs to China or Japan really depends on yesterday's doubles result. Under the spotlight of all eyes, the drums of battle sounded on all sides, and Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang lived up to their mission. The result of 3-1 defeated Japan. In total, two wins to one gives us a great advantage. In tomorrow's singles, Qiu Feihai's victory over Machida will be as easy as flipping a hand, while Jiang Daozhang will inevitably be defeated by Mr. Tawara. In the future, the overall result will be three wins to two for China, and it is likely to continue to maintain its position for another year. If you don't believe me, watch carefully on the field today.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Audience is Satisfied <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Dancing and Cheering - There were both Chinese and Western spectators, men and women, with more Chinese and Japanese people present. In total, there were over 1,800 people in the audience. Within two hours, four sets of fierce battles were full of highlights, too beautiful to take in. People were dancing and cheering, unable to contain themselves. Zhao, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who is enthusiastic about sports, also sat among the crowd and applauded to cheer on the players.</p>
<p>It is Best to Win Early - The central idea was to initially advocate a five-set battle to determine the outcome, so as to fully appreciate the skills of both sides. However, considering the national honor as the premise, it was hoped that Qiu and Jiang would win early and avoid failing at the last minute. Thus, the (advocating for more sets) tune finally changed (to it is best to win early). Satisfied and happy, they really returned with satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Qiu and Jiang are Indeed Extraordinary <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Battle was Decided in Four Sets</p>
<p>Mr. Tawara is Talented</p>
<p>Machida's Skills Were Inferior</p>
<p>2-6</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (China) 6-1 Tawara Sekio (Japan)</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang 7-5 Machida</p>
<p>6-4</p>
<p>At the beginning, a head-on blow – Japan's tennis association requested that Japanese people be appointed as line judges. Shen Siliang of the Coordination Association was forced to allow three Japanese people to participate. The superiority of the Japanese people's diplomatic means can be seen here. Tawara served, and the baseball touched the net and crossed, resulting in a loss in the first game. In the second and third games, the Japanese sometimes used the high ball to lure the enemy and gain the upper hand. In the fourth game, Jiang's interception and Qiu's smooth draw advanced from left and right, aggressively forcing the situation, resulting in a 2-2 tie. Afterwards, Qiu and Jiang's advance and retreat were slow, and their control was weak. However, the Japanese were seen rising straight up, game after game, snatching them away, and finally winning the first set with a score of 6-2.</p>
<p>As Easy as Flipping a Hand - In the first set, Qiu and Jiang's performance plummeted, which was disappointing. Unexpectedly, they showed their supernatural powers in the second set, and the victory came as easy as flipping a hand. The Japanese high ball was blocked horizontally, losing its effectiveness. In addition to winning in the second game, they encountered storms everywhere. When China took a 5-1 lead, both sides suddenly had a wonderful performance. The victory or defeat of a ball was always determined after a dozen or so wonderful exchanges. The spectators were dazzled and almost didn't know what to say. The result of this set was 6-1, and Qiu and Jiang won.</p>

<p>Great Success - In the first half of the third set, Jiang Daozhang's fierce draws and heavy pressure were invincible. Qiu's response was thorough, but he was slightly weaker. He took the lead with a score of 3-1. Afterwards, Tawara and Machida changed their strategies, and their momentum gradually increased. Soon, they created a score of 4-4 and 5-5 each. At that time, Qiu and Jiang's cooperation was excellent again. Before long, Qiu and Jiang won again with a score of 7-5. In the fourth set, the victory or defeat was linked, and the incoming and outgoing balls were used to measure against the opponent's weaker player. Jiang's skills were much better than Machida's, and China's spirit was higher than Japan's. Tawara tried to survive from desperate situations, but what could he do against the crowd? He could only sigh and pat his head. In the blink of an eye, China had won the game with a score of 5-2. The Japanese were trapped and resisted with all their might. Their spirit was particularly strong, but their skills were lacking. The failure to make it 4-6 was already a great fortune in misfortune. At the time, China won with a score of 3-1 with joy and dispersed with cheers.</p>

<p>Both Sides Can Win One Group Each</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu is Determined to Defeat Mr. Machida</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang is Difficult to Defeat Mr. Tawara</p>
<p>Today at 4:30 PM are the final two singles matches of the China-Japan finals. In terms of strength, there is no question that Qiu Feihai will defeat Machida. It is also a fact that Jiang Daozhang is difficult to defeat Tawara. They will each win one group. As a result, China is steadily achieving this year's championship with a score of 3-2 and will continue to hold it for another year. The cheers and laughter are imaginable.</p>

<p>Zhang Jingru Intensifies Work</p>
<p>Lu Zhuping Expected to Serve Again</p>
<p>Joint Meeting to be Held This Week</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is known as a prosperous area for sports, there are few comprehensive organizations for women, which is a pity. The reason is that no one can take full responsibility for promoting it. The Guang'nan Women's Gymnastic Association previously only had a small table tennis team. After deciding to expand in February of this year, although the department has not achieved considerable success, its spirit is still admirable. After the Feifei Women's Gymnastic Association's southern expedition was shelved, its strong members scattered, and Mr. Lu resigned. This spring, when the Guang'nan Association expanded, Feifei sent a letter urging Mr. Lu to resume his position, and there was talk of a merger between the two parties. Later, Mr. Lu did not agree to the request, and the matter was postponed accordingly.</p>
<p>According to Ms. Zheng Lihua, a close friend of Mr. Lu Zhuping, she knows Mr. Lu's purpose in life very well. He has always worked hard to promote sports. However, he was greatly shocked last year by the failure of the Feifei southern expedition due to differing opinions among the team members. Therefore, she advised him to retire temporarily. Now that both parties have a sincere intention to merge, Mr. Lu should be able to coordinate and promote its realization. Ms. Zhang Jingru, the accountant, has intensified her work to finalize the accounts in preparation for the merger.</p>
<p>Judging from this, the merger of the two associations has become a reality. It is heard that a joint meeting will be held this week, and the future is promising.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Discussing the Disaster Situation in Jiangbei <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Flew Over Jiangbei for a Week Yesterday and Returned to Shanghai on the Same Day – The Disaster Situation in Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Xinghua is More Severe – Jieshou, Sishui, and Baoying Areas are Relatively Prosperous – Zhu Qinglan, a member of the National Government's Relief Committee for Water Disasters, visited Jiangbei after the dikes of the Grand Canal broke, causing many areas to be flooded. He took a plane from the Shanghai Hongqiao Airport at 8 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by Mr. Shi Dupei, the chief engineer of the Yangtze River, and engineer Zhou Xiangxian, to Nanjing and then to Jiangbei to fly over and inspect the water disaster in various counties along the Grand Canal. After departing yesterday morning, Zhu and others completed their inspection in the afternoon and returned to Shanghai on the same plane, landing at Hongqiao Airport at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. They immediately went to the residence of Song Ziwen, the chairman of the National Government's Relief Committee for Water Disasters, on Bixun Road in the French Concession, to report. They returned to their residences for rest at around 5 p.m. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Zhu after hearing of his return to Shanghai. According to his account of the water disaster situation in Jiangbei after flying over the area yesterday, he said, "I departed at around 8 a.m. this morning with the chief engineer of the Yangtze River and others on a China National Aviation Corporation plane, first to Nanjing to refuel, and then via Longtan, Yizheng (Shi'erxu), Yangzhou, to Shaobo, Gaoyou, along the Grand Canal, to Jieshou, Sishui, Baoying, Xinghua, and other places, flying around for a week before returning. On the way, because the plane we were on was a land plane, we did not stop anywhere. However, when inspecting the disaster areas, the plane flew very low, so the inspection was very clear. The disaster situation in Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Xinghua is quite severe, but not as severe as reported in the newspapers. The rumor that Gaoshao is completely submerged is not accurate. When we inspected, we saw that Gaoyou City was still completely intact, and the houses built on high ground were still standing. Even in the low-lying areas, the roofs were still visible above the water. The city itself is in good condition, only the east, west, and north sides are more severely affected. Going north from here, from Jieshou through Sishui to Baoying County, everything is still intact. I saw that the area from Jieshou to Baoying is relatively prosperous, while in Xinghua County, the disaster situation is more severe, with fourteen breaches in the city walls."</p>

<h3 id="e95">Reports on the Disaster Situation in Wuhan <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Proof of the Chinese People's Resilience</p>
<p>Admirable Official and Commercial Disaster Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Necessity of Providing Relief Goods and Funds</p>
<p>The National Government's Relief Committee for Water Disasters previously sent engineer Baker to Wuhan to inspect the disaster situation. He returned to Shanghai on the 29th of this month. According to his report on the situation in Wuhan, the Chinese people have always possessed strong resilience. This Wuhan water disaster further proves this. Although the water in Hankou has not yet receded, vendors have already been able to place groceries and other items in wooden buckets, wading through the water to peddle them door to door. Merchants have also prepared to repair the city walls and damaged houses. Officials and bankers are also preparing to rebuild the shanty areas destroyed by the floods into new urban areas.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker deeply admired the swift and cooperative disaster relief efforts of officials and merchants in the three towns of Wuhan. The Wuhan Chamber of Commerce was able to gather 140 private organizations and 30 charitable institutions to handle emergency relief matters, demonstrating considerable魄力.</p>
<p>Many Chinese and foreign merchants have converted their warehouses into shelters for disaster victims. Residents have also been able to rescue people drifting in the water and help them onto their buildings, providing temporary accommodation until they can be moved to various shelters. Most of the food for the disaster victims is provided by the aforementioned merchants and residents, and some is distributed by the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker believes that the Relief Committee for Water Disasters should first establish a branch in Wuhan to cooperate with local officials and merchants. Emergency relief in Wuhan has already made some progress, but local financial resources and food supplies are nearing exhaustion. It is necessary for official and charitable relief organizations to quickly transport relief goods and provide financial assistance. Organizing a sound relief organization and dispatching technical personnel to repair dikes are also urgent tasks at present.</p>

<p>Red Cross Society Telegram The Nanjing Red Cross Society sent a telegram: To the Jiangsu Charity Relief Association for Water Disasters: The Pu disaster has been investigated by Shao Yun, but the largest sandbar in Jiangning, Shazhouwei, suddenly collapsed, flooding 70,000 mu of farmland and leaving tens of thousands of disaster victims homeless.

<p>Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Liu Tongqin, Gu Deguan, Kong Fankui, and other directors of the Yangzhou Eight Counties Shanghai Association, used the funds they raised to purchase buns. They publicly appointed Gu Deguan, Kong Fankui, Zheng Chaodian, and Wang Daolong to transport them to the disaster area by night train yesterday for distribution. It is also heard that Messrs. Liu and Gu have a second batch of cooked food that will be transported in the near future. Kind-hearted people who have buns and other relief items are requested to send them to the Xinzha Automobile Company on Xinzha Road in the city, where they can be contacted by Messrs. Liu Tongqin, Han Yuancai, and Xue Daoqi for transportation. It is also known that the association has raised over 1,000 bags of flour through Xue Hongchang, Zhang Jinkui, Wang Ganchen, Kong Maoru, Liu Zikui, and others. The first shipment of 530 bags has already been loaded and transported, with the remainder to follow. It is also heard that fundraising is still ongoing.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Relief Records of the Jisheng Association in Jiangsu <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Due to the severe water disasters in various provinces, the Chinese Jisheng Association has publicly appointed Zhu Qi to accompany relief workers to Wuhan for relief efforts. Zhai Junzhan Cheng and Liu Junlingsheng are investigating southern and northern Anhui, selecting counties with the most severe disasters for relief. Zhou Junyuankai and Li Junyushu were publicly appointed to provide relief in Huaian, Huaiyin, and Siyang counties in Jiangsu. A telegram was received from Gaoyou urgently reporting that a breach had occurred at the Dangjun Building north of the city, the disaster was severe, and the situation was extremely dire. Zhang Changwei Xianqing was publicly appointed to depart immediately with relief workers to investigate and provide emergency relief. All relief funds, food, medicine, and other items will be taken along. However, the floods in Gaoyou, Shaobo, and other places are unprecedented in a century, and the people are impoverished, with countless deaths. The number of survivors is estimated to be over 100,000, which is beyond the capacity of the association to assist. It is hoped that comrades at home and abroad will show compassion, either independently or by joining the association to work together and save as many lives as possible. This is no ordinary disaster and cannot be handled alone. All generous benefactors must understand this.</p>

<p>Wang Yiting, a standing committee member of the Relief Committee, recently went to western Zhejiang to inspect the disaster situation in Wuxing, Changxing, Deqing, Yuhang, and Wukang.

<h3 id="e100">Ning-Shao Emergency Relief Association Held a Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo and Shaoxing Associations and the Shanghai Siming Public Association, three groups that formed the Ning-Shao Emergency Relief Association for the Wuhan Disaster, convened a standing committee meeting yesterday at the Ningbo Shanghai Association on Xizang Road. Zhang Shenzhi, Shou Xiaotian, Sun Jitang, Wang Xiaolai, Hu Xisheng, Yu Qiaqing, Ge Yuchen, Shen Xiangfu, Wu Yaqin, Xu Xiajun, and others were present. Wang Xiaolai was publicly elected as chairman. A. Reporting Matters: (1) Dong Xinqin, who was sent to Hankou to escort the Ningbo fellow villagers affected by the disaster back to Shanghai on the Xinningxing ship, reported on the disaster situation in Hankou and the relief efforts for the Ningbo fellow villagers, as well as the journey of escorting the fellow villagers back to Yong and then to Shanghai, and the number of people. (2) Standing Committee Member Zhang Shenzhi reported on the reception and transfer of the disaster-stricken fellow villagers from Hankou to Shanghai by the association at the wharf when each ship arrived, and the subsequent sending of them back to their hometowns. B. Matters for Discussion: (1) Whether to send another ship to Hankou for relief. It was decided that since the water in Hankou was gradually receding and people were regaining stability, and according to the letter from the representative stationed in Hankou, it seemed unnecessary to send another ship. If there were any poor fellow villagers who could not afford to return to their hometowns, they could entrust Yin Huichang, the representative stationed in Hankou, to assist them, and the expenses would be reimbursed by the association. (2) Whether to continue renting the Xinningxing ship. It was decided to terminate the rental immediately and inform the Sanbei Company by letter. (3) The rent for the Huawu ship and the water bill. It was decided to ask Mr. Yu Qiaqing to contact the company. (4) How the expenses for the emergency relief in Wuhan should be borne. It was decided that Ningbo would bear 70% and Shaoxing 30%. It was also heard that the Yongxing ship, which was sent by the association to Hankou to rescue fellow villagers, set sail from Hankou on the morning of the 29th. Because Jiujiang and Anqing were also heavily affected by the disaster, it was feared that some fellow villagers were stranded there, so it was diverted to assist them. It is expected to arrive directly in Ningbo on the 31st. The association has telegraphed the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce for coordination.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Jianguo Ship Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday with Refugees <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianguo ship arrived safely in Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Zhang, an employee of the ship, the details of the voyage between Shanghai and Hankou were as follows: Mr. Zhang said that the Jianguo ship was ordered by telegram to sail to Hankou to transport refugees affected by the disaster. When it arrived in Jiujiang, it encountered a hurricane and took shelter there for a day. It arrived in Hankou on Tuesday and immediately transported over 100 passengers and over 400 refugees from Jiang, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The ship carried about 700 people in total. When it sailed to Jiujiang, over 200 more people boarded the ship. Of the original refugees, over 300 intended to disembark in Anqing. However, because the city of Anqing already had 70,000 to 80,000 disaster victims, it refused to allow refugees from outside to disembark, and the entire route was guarded by soldiers and police, making it impossible for the refugees to disembark. The ship then sailed to Datong, where over 400 people disembarked. 200 people disembarked in Nanjing. Therefore, when the ship arrived safely in Shanghai yesterday morning, there were only over 150 refugees from Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Suzhou. After being taken care of by the Social Bureau, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, and the Siming Public Association, they were sent back to their hometowns.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Shelters in Zhabei Begin Construction <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The municipal government believes that the number of refugees from the water disasters in various provinces coming to Shanghai will inevitably be large, and fears that there will be no place to accommodate them in time. Therefore, it has ordered the Public Works Bureau to build a large number of sheds at the foot of the Beiliuying Bridge on Gonghe New Road in Zhabei (formerly the base of the Second Regiment of the Army), commonly known as Xinyingpan, to accommodate the disaster victims arriving in Shanghai. Construction began yesterday. It is understood that there were dozens of barracks in the area, surrounded by short walls. Due to the lack of supervision, all the walls and houses were dismantled and stolen, leaving very few. Currently, in addition to slightly repairing the few remaining broken tile houses, the surrounding area is enclosed with bamboo fences. The area is very large, about 40 to 50 mu, and has become barren land. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau has ordered dozens of workers to remove the weeds. The ground is very damp, and coal cinder will need to be laid after the sheds are built. Therefore, a large number of bamboo and coal cinder have already been delivered for construction. One supervisor and two police officers have been assigned to oversee the work. The sheds are constructed with double-layered reed mats with oil paper in between to prevent leaks when it rains. The sheds are equipped with running water, and there are hospitals, fire brigades, tiger stoves, and men's and women's bathing areas at the entrance, providing everything needed. The refugees' living quarters are divided into left and right sides, and families can live together. It is said that the construction will be completed within a week, and the Public Security Bureau plans to send 50 police officers to maintain order after the refugees arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Executive Committee Meeting of the Anhui Water Disaster Relief Association <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anhui Water Disaster Relief Association held a plenary meeting of the executive committee at Yipinxian yesterday, attended by over 200 people, including Xu Jiyu, Xu Jingren, and Lü Gaoyu. Xu Jingren presided over the meeting. The discussions included: (1) Wang Dizhai proposed that during his previous tenure in the Anhui Civil Affairs Department, the China Foreign Relief Association had a surplus of over 150,000 yuan in Anhui relief funds. Whenever Anhui encountered a disaster, a request had to be made, but the association always made excuses about guiding the Huai River and refused to release the funds. Now that the guiding of the Huai River is under the government's management, this surplus should be requested and allocated to Anhui for relief efforts. The resolution was passed and Li Cishan, Wang Dizhai, and Wang Yucheng were appointed as representatives to negotiate seriously. (2) The funds raised by the association were entrusted to Liu Zhensheng, Zhai Zhancheng, and Xu Pingxuan, who were sent by the government to Anhui as special commissioners for relief distribution. The funds were remitted to the Anqing, Wuhu, and Bengbu Chambers of Commerce for collection and distribution by various counties, selecting those in urgent need. The resolution was passed. (3) The Anhui Provincial Government was requested to issue 5 million yuan in disaster relief bonds, which would be used exclusively for emergency relief and not diverted to other charities or other purposes. The resolution was passed. (4) Disaster victims in various counties were in urgent need of food, and the government was unable to provide for them daily. The provincial government was requested to strictly order various counties to properly appease and assist them. The resolution was passed. (5) The Beijing Fellow Villagers Association sent a letter stating that Fang Yushan was privately profiting from over 300,000 yuan in Tianjin-Pukou Railway stocks and interest, which were earmarked for Anhui public welfare, and was refusing to hand them over. It was resolved to pursue and release them for emergency relief. (6) Xu Jingren, Kai Yunnong, Li Cishan, Xu Jiyu, Hong Zhenjiu, Li Zhenya, and Cao Zhigong were elected as representatives to liaise with relief organizations and charities. The resolution was passed. (7) The chairman reported that the Shanghai Bank had donated 6,000 yuan, which had been allocated to the association. Fundraising was still ongoing, and the committee members present made pledges and volunteered to solicit donations. Song Bangding, a weaving worker, donated 50 yuan, which he had saved from years of hard work, moving the audience and prompting even more enthusiastic donations.</p>

<p>Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Plans Disaster Relief: Due to the nationwide floods this year, the government has established a disaster relief committee.  Gu Daosheng, Director of the Shanghai Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau, and Jiang Bi, Director of the Public Sales Bureau, acting on instructions from the Jiangsu Stamped Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau and the Finance Ministry, are planning disaster relief efforts.  They hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Western Restaurant at 7 p.m. the day before yesterday, inviting leaders from the tobacco, alcohol, and sauce industries.  Over a hundred people attended, including Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Gu Xinyi, and Mr. Chen Liangyu.  Guan Jiong, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Stamped Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, personally hosted the event and gave a sincere and moving speech, stating that this year's flood is exceptionally severe, affecting nearly the entire country, with Wuhan being the worst.  Shanghai enjoys peace and prosperity, a world apart from the disaster areas.  In past disasters, Shanghai has provided the most relief, and Heaven has favored Shanghai, sparing it from the recent terrible wind and rain, preserving this piece of pure land to save the country's disaster victims.  He said that everyone has always acted courageously for righteousness and will surely donate generously.  He respectfully requested the gentlemen to diligently raise large sums of money, for every penny could save a life.  Mr. Yu Qiaqing then spoke, emphasizing the urgency of gathering for fundraising and stating that saving others is saving oneself.  He proposed that businesses donate ten days' worth of profits to relief efforts, and employees donate 20% of their salaries.  The industry leaders unanimously approved these measures and immediately began organizing their respective sectors.  The tobacco and alcohol tax's banquet for fundraising was very successful, demonstrating the enthusiasm of the tobacco, alcohol, and sauce industries for disaster relief.  The amount of donations raised will undoubtedly be substantial, offering a glimmer of hope for the millions of victims.  Other speakers included Mr. Chen Liangyu, Mr. He Xiangsheng, and Mr. Shen Weiting, all of whom spoke passionately and sincerely, moving the audience. Due to the length of the speeches, they are omitted here.</p>

<p>Proper Method Needed for Distributing Relief Cakes: A letter from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Water Disasters in Various Provinces states: "We are writing to inform you that our members have reported seeing many charitable people purchasing large quantities of cakes to send to the disaster area for relief. However, due to the thickness of the cakes and the bakeries' rush to deliver, they are often raw inside. These charitable people, not having time to wait for them to cool, pack and transport them immediately. By the time they arrive in the disaster area, they are already moldy. Disaster victims, with long-empty stomachs, do not consider hygiene and often become ill and die after eating them. Thus, these charitable individuals inadvertently cause harm while intending to do good. Our association, upon receiving this report and confirming its accuracy, is writing to request that your association promptly devise a proper method to guide charitable people who go alone to distribute relief, which is our sincere hope."</p>
<p>Lawyer Yao Jian's Suggestion: Lawyer Yao Jian, a member of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, recently submitted a letter to the Shanghai Lawyers Association, requesting that it be proposed and resolved. He wrote that this year's water disaster in China has affected 80 million people. Although the government has issued 80 million yuan in public bonds, this averages only one yuan per person. While the people are happy to donate, it is difficult to reach 80 million yuan. The government should accept any policy that does not harm the country's vitality. He observed that the recent increase in crime has filled prisons in various provinces, wasting national funds. To rescue disaster victims, prison food should be used. All those sentenced to less than five years, regardless of gender, whether their cases have been decided or not, should be allowed to commute their sentences to cash, with a temporary commutation regulation set at one or three yuan per day, effective from this month. This would average 1,000 yuan per person, and 10,000 people would yield 10 million yuan. (The number of criminals in the Shanghai Chinese Concession and Settlement exceeds 10,000.) The whole country could generate over 80 million yuan. Those sentenced to more than five years, except for those guilty of capital crimes and banditry, should be sent to the disaster areas to perform river-management labor, with one day of labor offsetting two days of imprisonment. This would empty the prisons, bringing harmony to the world, and prison food could be used for relief. Those who commute their sentences can work in society and contribute to production. The country establishing a commutation regulation for disaster victims is more honorable than previous national day amnesties. Redemption is permitted by ancient laws and should leave no regrets for future generations. It would also gain the respect of other countries, who would recognize the government's emphasis on the people's lives. 60% of the funds should be used for relief, 10% to purchase river-dredging machinery, starting dredging from the outlet, 10% to purchase drainage machinery, 10% to purchase new-style agricultural tools for mechanized planting and harvesting, and 10% to purchase seeds and scientific instruments for chemical farming to increase yields. What do you think of this opinion? Please propose a resolution and forward it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval and implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Stagnation of Shanghai's Industries <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Merchants Inevitably Show Worry</p>
<p>Greatest Impact on Woolen and Foreign Goods</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, continuous heavy rains have caused floods in various regions, with breaches in river channels frequently reported. The most severe are in Wuhan and Shaobo in northern Jiangsu, where hundreds of thousands of people have drowned, an unprecedented event in recent centuries. People across the country have risen to provide disaster relief. Shanghai, as a commercial port with thriving businesses, leads the country. August and September are usually the time when autumn goods are launched, and merchants from various regions come to Shanghai to purchase goods. Due to the floods, merchants have stopped coming to Shanghai, and those with branch offices in Shanghai have also received telegrams to stop purchasing goods. Freight transport has completely stopped in Gaoyou, Shaobo, Xinghua, Yancheng, Dongtai, Bao Ying, Tai County, Funing, and along the Yangtze River in Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang. The volume of goods purchased by merchants from Wanxian, Yichang, Tianjin, and Niuzhuang has also been greatly reduced due to the floods. As a result, all industries in Shanghai inevitably show worry, anticipating that there will be no recovery in business this autumn. The greatest impact is on the woolen and foreign goods industries, followed by general merchandise, and then silk and dyes.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Difficulty Reorganizing Shanghai's Grain Storage Funds <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs previously sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate grain storage matters. It is now reported that the department has instructed the county to thoroughly reorganize. The department has stipulated measures that require counties where grain storage funds have been misappropriated to investigate and identify those who misappropriated the funds, issue warnings in the newspaper, and set a deadline for repayment. However, the situation regarding the misappropriation of grain funds in Shanghai County is unique and different from other counties. During the Qi-Lu War, over 100,000 yuan from the grain storage fund was misappropriated for military use. At that time, Shen Zhou, the deputy director of the former fund property office, insisted on protecting the funds for famine relief and argued strongly with the military headquarters, even leading to his detention. He was eventually released through the efforts of various gentry, but the funds were still taken away. Later, there was talk of repayment from the proceeds of the sale of the arsenal, but the sale has been cancelled and is no longer an option. Those concerned about famine relief should consider how to recover these funds.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Shipping News Amidst the Boycott <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Stopping the Sale of Rapeseed: Wuhu rapeseed is mainly exported to Japan. Since the boycott, Japanese merchants have been rushing to ship their purchased goods to Japan. In recent days, Nisshin Yangtze River ships arriving in Shanghai have been carrying a large amount of rapeseed, which is being transshipped to Japan through the Japanese postal service. Currently, there are still 38,000 packages of rapeseed in Wuhu that have not been loaded for export. Upon receiving this information, the Anti-Japanese Association has telegraphed Wuhu to stop selling the goods to Japanese merchants and to stop loading them.</p>
<p>British Merchants Add Ships: Since the boycott of Japanese ships and the lack of Chinese ships sailing on the South China route, Jardine Matheson has achieved a dominant position in import and export trade in Shantou and Guangdong. Following the recent loss of the Guang Sheng and the grounding of the Wei Sheng, the company telegraphed its Hong Kong headquarters to send the 3,000-ton ocean liners Daweigen and Sandagen to Shanghai to operate exclusively on the Shanghai-Shantou-Guangdong route, with the first voyages scheduled to begin on September 2nd.</p>
<p>No Cargo on the Yangtze River: Chinese merchants have effectively stopped loading Japanese ships on the Yangtze River route. The Nisshin Company's Xiangyang Maru ship has no cargo loaded from Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, and Jiujiang. It has only twelve pieces of general merchandise in Hankou, making it virtually empty. The shipping industry has been the most affected by this boycott.</p>
<p>Request to Transfer Crew Members: The Zhengji Company's merchant ships total more than twenty. Because the head office is located in Dalian, the captains, first officers, and second officers on each ship have historically been Japanese. After the rise in the value of gold last year, the salaries of the captains, first officers, and second officers, which are calculated in Japanese yen, have greatly increased the expenditure in national currency, totaling more than 300,000 yuan in losses. During the current nationwide boycott, the company has decided to replace the Japanese crew members on each ship with Chinese nationals, both to save on salaries and to express patriotism. The company has telegraphed the Shanghai Shipping Association, requesting assistance in finding shipping professionals with coastal experience to serve as captains and replace the Japanese. The Shipping Association believes that this matter concerns sovereignty and requires a large number of qualified personnel, so it has telegraphed the Ministry of Communications for instructions and requested recommendations.</p>
<p>Hydrographic Office</p>
<h3 id="e111">Receives Customs-Operated Surveying <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Since the Navy Hydrographic Office took charge of national waterway surveying, it has been systematically surveying the country's rivers and coasts. However, the waterway from Toutou Chun at the mouth of the Yangtze River to Liancheng Zhou in Jiangyin, specifically from 122 degrees 9 minutes 30 seconds east longitude and 31 degrees 0 minutes 36 seconds north latitude to 122 degrees 0 minutes 12 seconds east longitude and 31 degrees 59 minutes 24 seconds north latitude, has been surveyed by special teams from the Customs using the Liujin ships to manage taxation. This arrangement is unprecedented in the world. Recently, the matter was approved by the National Government after being submitted by the Navy, and the Ministries of Finance and Navy were instructed to order the Customs to transfer this survey work to the Hydrographic Office. All Customs funds, equipment, files, charts, and related items for surveying the area should be transferred to the Hydrographic Office for continued operation. Transfer procedures are currently underway to facilitate active operations. The area is the gateway to the Yangtze River, with very frequent ship traffic and rapid changes in water flow and sandbars. To ensure navigational safety, the Hydrographic Office has dispatched the Jiao Ri and Jing Xing ships to conduct surveys and has published revised charts for various sections, including Baoshan to Baimao Sha, Tongzhou Waterway, Langshan to Longtan Port, and Longtan Port to Liancheng Zhou. The survey of the Yangtze River mouth to Wusong Waterway has also been completed and will be published soon. The accuracy and detail of these charts have been praised by shipowners. Further surveys will be conducted and charts published to benefit safe navigation.</p>

<p>Social Bureau's Notice Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e113">Labor-Management Dispute Both Parties Comply <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Those Who Disobey Summons</p>
<p>Should Be Subject to Appropriate Fines</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating that those who intentionally disobey summonses in labor-management disputes should be subject to appropriate fines. The notice states that labor-management disputes are already a social malady. If one party petitions for mediation and the other intentionally refuses to attend, causing prolonged disputes that harm both sides, it is especially inappropriate. The bureau, recognizing the worsening habit of parties in labor-management disputes intentionally disobeying summonses, has drafted measures for punishment and submitted them to the Municipal Government's Instruction No. 11643, which states: "The implementation of assessing appropriate fines for parties in labor-management disputes who intentionally disobey summonses should be handled by the relevant administrative office. Please comply accordingly." In addition to complying with this from today onward, this notice is issued to both labor and management in the city for full awareness.</p>
<p>Following the Western Restaurant Strike</p>
<h3 id="e114">Social Bureau to Mediate Tomorrow <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Has Asked the Court to Compel the Employer to Attend</p>
<p>Union Executive Arrested and Sentenced to Four Months</p>
<p>Following the Western restaurant workers' strike on the 12th over treatment and conditions, Western chefs joined the strike in solidarity. The employer reportedly defied government orders and refused to resume work, causing delays until now. The Social Bureau has scheduled mediation for tomorrow. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation Proceeding: Because the Western Restaurant Industry Association defied government orders, refused to resume work, and intentionally failed to attend, causing prolonged disputes, the Social Bureau notified the Western Restaurant Workers Union yesterday, stating: "Regarding the labor-management dispute over treatment and conditions, this bureau has scheduled a hearing for 9 a.m. on September 1st. This notice is hereby issued to the union, instructing it to designate two responsible representatives to attend the hearing." A letter has also been sent to the Special District Court, compelling the responsible person of the Western Restaurant Association to attend the hearing.</p>
<p>Executive Arrested: Li Zuoheng, the executive director of the Western Chefs Union, was arrested on August 20th at the Yizhi Xiang Western Restaurant on Fourth Avenue for persuading non-union members not to disrupt the labor movement. He was detained by the Old Zhabei police station and handed over to the Special District Court for trial. He was sentenced to four months imprisonment the day before yesterday. The union claims that the executive was acting legally and has declared its dissatisfaction, retaining lawyer Xi Yuchang to file an appeal and petitioning the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Social Bureau to request the court to release him.</p>
<p>Labor Community Support: Over twenty unions, including the municipal water and electricity, pharmacy, hat-making, umbrella, pharmaceutical, dyeing, sauce, and cigarette industries, have declared that the Western restaurant employer defied government orders, refused to resume work, and disregarded the livelihood of the workers. They have issued declarations and petitioned the responsible authorities to punish the employer and promptly convene mediation to save over five hundred workers from their plight.</p>
<p>Nisshin Textile Mill</p>
<h3 id="e115">Obstructs Workers from Organizing a Union <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Guomin News reported that over 3,000 workers at the Nisshin Textile Mill in Pudong established a union in May of 1925, when the May Thirtieth Massacre occurred. Later, the factory used reactionaries to control union affairs, leading to the collapse of union work and its de facto suspension. Seeing the union disintegrate, the factory increased the workers' workload to twelve hours per day, did not stop work on revolutionary memorial days, did not pay wages, and arbitrarily dismissed workers. All enthusiastic members who had previously served the union were dismissed. The workers' suffering is beyond description. Recently, workers at the mill, unable to endure the factory's oppression, petitioned the party and government authorities, requesting relief from their suffering. The Fifth District Cotton Textile Industry Union appointed Huang Linxiang and others as preparatory members for the Nisshin Textile Mill branch office and were posting notices to inform the workers to register. However, the Japanese in the factory obstructed them, tore down the notices, and forbade posting them. They ordered the foremen to identify workers and forbid them from registering. At the same time, they hired over a hundred people to monitor the workers' movements. A certain enthusiastic worker surnamed Huang from the cleaning workshop's steel wire department was seen leading workers to register, reported to the factory by those hired by the factory, and subsequently punished with a three-day suspension. Upon hearing this news, the workers in the department, angered by the factory's illegal oppression, were all stirred up and will take serious action. The union has petitioned higher authorities to send personnel to seriously negotiate with the factory and to arrest and punish those used by the factory according to the law.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai South Shanghai Bus Company suffered a factory fire this spring, more than half of its vehicles were lost. At that time, it reorganized the remaining vehicles and made efforts to maintain traffic on two or three routes. At the same time, it ordered new "Lanau" buses from the American "Li Wei" Foreign Company and rushed to build the bus bodies. It is now learned that the company's new buses have all been built. Each vehicle is worth more than eight thousand yuan, with both appearance and interior perfected. It can seat more than forty passengers. Ten of these new buses will first operate on Route 3. Once the second batch of new buses is completed, they will operate on Route 2 and restore traffic on Route 1. However, it is reported that Route 4, from Xujiahui to the Airport, was previously impassable due to road damage. With the understanding of the Municipal Government, the English Municipal Council was approved to repair it, originally scheduled for one month. However, the first bridge at the Hongqiao Road-Haig Road intersection and the second bridge on Yangzhai Road have not yet begun reconstruction. Therefore, the operation of Route 4 buses on Hongqiao Road may be slightly delayed.</p>

<p>Since assuming office, Zhang Yiqing, the chairman of the Shanghai "Lijiao" United Association, has spared no effort in improving all aspects of "Lijiao." In particular, in the case of the Jiangsu Provincial Party and Government organs' ban on "Lijiao" in 1929, Mr. Zhang argued his case based on reason, and the Central Government ultimately approved the revocation of the ban, which further strengthened the faith of "Lijiao" members nationwide. Recently, Mr. Zhang, due to being overwhelmed with affairs, has been unable to manage it concurrently and has expressed his intention not to be elected in the upcoming election, as stated in a newspaper announcement. Upon hearing this, the "Lijiao" associations believed that Mr. Zhang had been in charge of the association's affairs for many years, and the members of "Lijiao" had benefited greatly. Moreover, at a time when disasters are frequent everywhere, it is the season for "Lijiao" to work hard to promote good deeds. Once he resigns, the public is panicked. Yesterday, representatives from the "Lijiao" associations, numbering in the hundreds, went to Mr. Zhang's residence together, sincerely requesting him to stay. Mr. Zhang agreed to give it due consideration, but the members of "Lijiao" are eagerly hoping that Mr. Zhang will dismiss his intention to resign as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team</p>
<h3 id="e126">Seizes Large Quantity of Military Arms <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Smugglers Dared to Open Fire and Resist Arrest</p>
<p>Six People Arrested and Taken to Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>On the morning of the 29th of this month, at approximately 2:00 AM, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team cracked down on a large quantity of firearms in the Yangshupu river area in northern Shanghai. At that time, the smugglers dared to open fire and resist arrest. Fortunately, the officers and police of the team bravely stepped forward and were able to capture the witnesses and evidence and take them to the bureau for interrogation. The details are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>On the evening of the 28th of this month, at approximately 9:00 PM, Water Patrol Team Captain Xu dispatched Patrol Officer Li Chenghua, along with team members Zhang Dianchen, Song Deyun, and others, to patrol the jurisdictional area. The following day (29th), at approximately 2:00 AM, Patrol Officer Li and others were patrolling the river area off Yangshupu in northern Shanghai when they saw a French merchant ship moored in the middle of the river. A barge was alongside it, and sacks were being unloaded from the ship onto the barge. However, the actions of the people on the barge were strange. Patrol Officer Li and others became suspicious. Just as they were about to patrol closer to investigate,</p>
<p>More than Ten Shots Fired Suddenly, they heard two gunshots from the French merchant ship. The patrol officers became even more suspicious and immediately approached the ship. However, the people on the ship fired more than ten shots at the officers, one bullet hitting a police officer's hat, while the rest hit the deck, fortunately without injuring anyone. They then threw a sack into the river. The people on the barge alongside were alarmed and immediately sailed away. The police bravely pursued and managed to intercept the barge on the spot.</p>
<p>Seized Military Arms Patrol Officer Li and others immediately boarded the barge and conducted an inspection. They found nine sacks in the cabin, which, when opened, revealed Browning pistols and Browning pistol bullets, bullet clips, etc., as well as one Mauser pistol and one hundred Mauser pistol bullets. As the matter involved the smuggling of a large quantity of firearms, they immediately arrested the barge crew members Mao Jinkai, Zhang Chengkui, and Xun Henian, Tang Guicai, Su Guifu, Yang Wanhe, and others, and sent the witnesses and evidence to the Water Patrol Team.</p>
<p>One Sack Retrieved Captain Xu then dispatched Liu Qimin, an officer from the First Squad, Lujiazui Police Station, along with Police Chief Chen Baozhen, to the scene of the incident to retrieve the sack thrown from the French merchant ship. After about four hours, the sack was retrieved. When the sack was opened, many more bullets were found and taken back to the main team.</p>
<p>Statements from the Crews of Both Ships During the preliminary interrogation by Captain Xu, barge crew member Mao Jinkai, 34 years old, from Yancheng, stated that on the afternoon of the 28th of this month, at approximately 6:00 PM, a Mr. Huang from Guangdong instructed him to sail the barge to Yangshupu that evening to transport goods. Due to business reasons, he complied and sailed the barge to the French merchant ship in the middle of the Yangshupu river. Before long, Mr. Huang unloaded many sacks from the ship. He caught sight of the police team arriving and quickly steered the boat away to avoid them temporarily, but was still arrested. Zhang Chengkui, 45 years old, from Yancheng, stated that his statement was similar to Mao's.</p>
<p>Case Sent to Public Security Bureau During the interrogation, Xun Henian, 31 years old, Tang Guicai, 32 years old, Su Guifu, 31 years old, and Yang Wanhe, 21 years old, all stated that they were from Yancheng and worked as inspectors on the Shunheng Steamboat. Recently, they had important business together and hired Mao's barge from Pudong to cross the river. Mao suddenly sailed the barge close to the French merchant ship and transported sacks. They were impatient and urged him to leave quickly. They were then apprehended by the police team. However, they all denied knowing anything about the smuggling of firearms. As the case was important, they were instructed to prepare documents and send the six arrested individuals, along with the seized military arms, to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>According to the "Continental Daily," in order to obtain timely information and facilitate arrests, the Public Concession Police Department installed police-only telephones on telephone poles at important intersections yesterday (29th). In the future, if serious cases such as kidnappings or robberies occur, the patrol police can immediately use the telephone to report to the police station. The police station can then notify all patrol police in the entire concession within five minutes to assist in the apprehension, making it difficult for criminals to escape.</p>
<p>Daughter-in-Law of Salt Merchant</p>
<h3 id="e128">Accuses Husband's Brother of Seizing Property <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Husband Suffering from Mental Illness</p>
<p>Inheritance Managed by Husband's Brother, Shi Ying</p>
<p>Monthly Household Expenses Not Provided</p>
<p>Zhang Yeting Forced to Sue</p>
<p>Woman Zhang Yexiu, from Nanjing, 39 years old, residing at No. 13 Mingwa Lane, Nanjing, is the ninth daughter-in-law of the famous salt merchant Zhang Shaotang. Zhang Yexiu is now suing her husband's brother, Shi Ying, for seizing all the inheritance. She has hired three lawyers, Xu Bingcheng, Yu Naiheng, and Xu Fuji, to file a criminal self-indictment in the First Special District Court, requesting that he be punished for breach of trust and embezzlement under Articles 366 and 356 of the Criminal Code. The lawsuit is recorded as follows: (Excerpt above) The ninth son, Shi Kun, of the late Zhang Shaotang, was married to the plaintiff. All of the late Shaotang's inheritance, in December of the eighth year of the Republic [1919], was divided among the eight branches of the family by relatives, with each branch receiving its share and managing it independently. However, the plaintiff's husband, Shi Kun, suffered from a mental illness, which would come and go, and was unable to manage affairs. His share of the inheritance was managed by his brother, Shi Ying (of the seventh branch). It was said that after managing the property of the ninth branch, he would make it a huge fortune in ten years. As Shi Kun suffered from mental illness, he had no say, and the plaintiff did not suspect any ulterior motives, so she deeply trusted him. However, after Shi Ying took over the management of the property, he first limited the plaintiff's household expenses to only 200 yuan per month. Later, as the population grew and household expenses increased, she repeatedly requested that it be gradually increased to 400 yuan. By 1928, when her eldest son, Zonggu, married into his wife's family, she asked Shi Ying for funds, but he refused, claiming he had no money, and sold the ancestral property under her husband's name to pay for Zonggu's marriage. The plaintiff, considering the relationship, tolerated it. Shi Ying, seeing that the plaintiff had given in, thought she was easy to deceive. Whenever the plaintiff had special expenses, he would blackmail her in every way, refusing to issue the funds. If she argued with him, he would become angry. Since January of 1930, he has not provided a single cent of the 400 yuan monthly household expenses. Although relatives have tried to persuade him in every way, it has been to no avail. Shi Ying clearly knows that all of the property of the ninth branch is in his hands, and he abruptly stopped the living expenses for a minor reason. Upon investigation, Shi Ying manages Shi Kun's property in two parts, public and private. Regarding the private property, just in terms of the rice fields, the amount of rice harvested and the price of rice sold differ greatly each year compared to the adjacent fields. Moreover, the items listed in his report are very vague, and there are countless contradictions. As for the public property, just in terms of the Yihexiang Salt Company, since its opening until Shi Ying took over, there was a surplus of more than 480,000 yuan. After he took over, the annual business situation, according to custom, should have been reported in a red list or listed in a report at the end of each year for verification. However, since Shi Ying took over, there has been no paper or word. The other branches receive funds from Yihexiang completely based on Shi Ying's emotions, with those he likes receiving more and those he dislikes receiving less, with the former receiving 80,000 to 90,000 yuan and the latter receiving 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, but the plaintiff's husband receives a dividend of only a few thousand yuan. As the salt company is jointly owned, all profits should be distributed equally among the branches, but now they are disproportionately light and heavy, which is clearly embezzlement. Based on the facts stated above, Zhang Shi Ying is truly deserving of punishment. She hereby submits a petition requesting a warrant to summon the defendant to court to be punished according to the law.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Alumni Association of Jiaotong University on Two Railways Established <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Li Zhaohuan and Guo Chengen Both Gave Speeches</p>
<p>All alumni of Jiaotong University who serve on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, in view of the fact that they are usually scattered in various places and their feelings need to be connected, elected three preparatory committee members in the first half of the year to prepare for the establishment of the alumni association of Jiaotong University on two railways. The first inaugural meeting was held at the Datong Restaurant on the afternoon of the 29th, and Wu Shuchang, Shi Ziyu, and others were elected as the presidium, with Cheng Zhenyue as the recorder. The charter was discussed, and 21 articles were passed. Subsequently, executive and supervisory committee members were elected. At 7:00 PM, a dinner party was held, attended by Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan, Dean Li Qianruo, Zhong Weicheng, Wang Shenshan, directors Guo Chengen and Liu Chengchang of the two railways, Wang Xuan, Yuan Shaochang, Li Yunyuan, and others, along with more than 200 alumni, in a grand and unprecedented event. In the middle of the dinner, Chairman Shi Ziyu gave a speech, stating the purpose of the alumni association, saying that enhancing feelings should focus on the spiritual aspect, and that desires should not be too extravagant. Next, President Li gave a speech, briefly stating the recent situation of the alma mater, including the expansion of the School of Management, the completion of the Engineering Hall, the receipt of the Boxer Indemnity, and the plan to hold a 35th anniversary celebration and railway industry exhibition at the end of the year, hoping for enthusiastic participation. He then discussed the significance of Nanyang University, saying that at the end of the Qing Dynasty, when foreign powers were oppressing, court officials established the Northern and Southern Oceans naval and land forces, and insightful people founded Nanyang University to cultivate talents for the next century. After 35 years, the contributions of the graduates to society and the country are probably still far from what the sages of the past hoped for, and we must work hard to improve. Finally, he thoroughly discussed the ills of selfishness and self-interest, moving the audience. Next, Director Guo gave a speech, saying that modern people should use their hands as tools for doing things and not regard them as decorations. His meaning was similar to that of President Li, and they were all encouraging words. At 10:00 PM, the event ended happily. The election results are attached: Executive Committee members: Wu Shuchang, Shi Ziyu, Li Dasan, Yan Baoli, Xu Xuwang, Liu Yiqi, Wang Shulong. Supervisory Committee members: Yuan Shaochang, Chen Mingshou, Hua Yingxuan, Zhong Wenjiang, Chen Sicheng.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The "Yang Yongtai" Sandboat Encountered Hurricane Disaster <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Ship Hit the Beach and the Cargo Was Lost</p>
<p>People Scattered and Returned in a Wretched State</p>
<p>The "Yang Yongtai" sandboat of Beiyang recently loaded soybean oil and other northern goods from Dalian and set sail back to Shanghai. However, during the recent hurricane, the "Yang" ship was sailing on the Zhishan sea. The crew members saw that the situation was fierce and the waves were turbulent. They were about to look for a port to anchor and avoid the wind, but a gust of wind and waves struck, breaking the ship's rudder. Then the bow mast was blown off by the strong wind. The crew members were panic-stricken. At the same time, the three crew members working at the bow were swept into the sea by the waves. The crew members were helpless and had to retreat to the cabin. Suddenly, the ship was driven by the wind and waves to the Fushan estuary beach in Nantong, where it overturned and ran aground on the beach. The hull was smashed. The crew members called for help for a day and a night, but no ship came to the rescue. The ship was flooded. The next morning, when it dawned, the crew members used the small sampan on the ship to reach the beach. Several crew members were squeezed into the sea while rushing to get on the sampan. The shipowner and several crew members used the sampan to reach the Fushan seaside and stayed on the hillside for two days. It was not until the sea calmed down on the 27th that a fishing boat sailed past and called for help. The fishing boat rescued the crew members of the "Yang" ship, carried them to Liuhhe. The crew members had no food or drink for three or four days after the disaster. The sandboats moored in Liuhhe learned of the disaster and provided meals and clothing. The charity provided clothing. The ship had 21 crew members, and the shipowner found nine people missing. The crew members are currently staying in hotels. Yesterday, the shipowner and three crew members took a train from Wusong to Shanghai to report to the owners and cargo owners. It is reported that the ship was smashed in the middle and is useless. The water level has been rising in recent days, and although the ship is aground on the beach, it is likely to be submerged. The ship and cargo are worth 120,000 to 130,000 taels. The owners have hired a ship to go and inspect, but it is unknown whether it can be salvaged.</p>

Witness Wang Jiyun then testified that he lived with the defendant and that the defendant went out to see a play at Leyi Building on Taopeng Road at 11:00 PM that night and returned at 2:45 AM, without any sign of panic. He bought and drank "Holan" water, sat and cooled down. After a while, Huang Haitang was arrested. Another witness, Zhang Jinsheng, testified that the defendant gathered many people to his house at about 6:00 AM that morning, beat him up without any reason, and said that he wanted to kill three more people, including the deceased and someone else. He said that the defendant had been violent in the past. The deceased's wife, Huang Shi, firmly stated that she had witnessed the defendant fleeing as soon as he saw her arrive, and demanded strict punishment to avenge her husband. When questioned, the defendant said that he had no grudges with the deceased and that the matter of borrowing money was completely fabricated. He said that he had a dispute with witness Zhang Jinsheng because he had opened a "Swallow's Nest" and sold opium. He claimed that Huang Haitang was assassinated and then falsely accused him of being arrested. He claimed that the morning Zhang said that he had gathered people to beat him up and wanted to kill him were all false. He hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an for his defense. After Judge Xiao verified the testimony, he ordered the defendant to be returned to custody. The debate in this case has concluded, and sentencing is scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Murder by Strangulation, Body Abandoned in Hanoi <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Male corpse found in the Haitang Creek of Dongjiadu</p>
<p>On the   Haitang Creek at the southern end of the Sanguantang in Dongjiadu, Pudong, at approximately 4 PM the day before yesterday, a male corpse of unknown identity suddenly surfaced. The man had a shaved head, wore a white undershirt on his upper body, was naked below the waist, and had no shoes or socks. He suffered from eczema on his feet and appeared to be around thirty years old. A hemp rope was tied tightly around his neck, cutting deep into the flesh, clearly indicating that he had been strangled to death. However, the body was not bloated, suggesting that he was murdered on land and then dumped into the creek to cover up the crime. Passersby discovered the body and immediately reported it to the Third Precinct, Third Division for investigation. Chief Dong of the precinct determined that the incident occurred in a small creek at the boundary between the sixteenth and seventeenth districts. He then instructed the district heads Yin Bangfu and Hu Atao to report the matter to the local court for an autopsy. Yesterday at 3 PM, the court appointed Inspector Yang, accompanied by assistants, to conduct an examination in Pudong. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased had indeed been strangled to death with a rope. As no family members claimed the body, the district heads were ordered to prepare a coffin for burial while the search for the murderer continued. The creek banks are in a desolate and sparsely populated area, and there have been incidents of bandits robbing pedestrians of their money and valuables at night. It is possible that the victim was robbed of his money and clothing by bandits and then murdered to silence him. The local police station should pay close attention.</p>

<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the Shanghai Mineral Ash United Business Office to express our astonishment regarding the news item in today's Shen Bao concerning the detention of mineral ash, which alleges that our office forcibly detained mineral ash belonging to Qian Renxing. Upon investigation, our office has never engaged in any such activity. Furthermore, our office serves as a joint business organization for all mineral ash traders in Shanghai and is purely commercial in nature, possessing no authority to detain goods. The report in your newspaper is clearly inaccurate, and we request that you issue a correction to avoid any misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Therefore, we, as representatives, urgently submit this letter, hoping that you will investigate and issue a correction to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to the Shen Bao,</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>The World's Smallest Post Office</p>
<p>The world's smallest post office isn't really a post office at all. It's actually a small, painted bottle tied to a rock in the ocean, left to float on the surface. It's located in the Strait of Magellan. When ships pass by, they always send a small boat to collect the mail and place outgoing letters in the bottle. This small post office has no staff and no expenses. Yet, navies around the world protect it.</p>
<p>Ostrich Feathers Are Back in Style</p>
<p>Ostrich feathers, which were the most fashionable adornments for European and American women decades ago, are back in style this year in social circles. However, the supply is quite limited. In 1913, South Africa had an estimated 750,000 ostriches, but by 1923, production had fallen to less than half that number. In recent years, it has likely decreased even further.</p>
<h3 id="e147">In Memory of Mr. Fan Shan's Last Work <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>Fan Fanshan (Zengxiang) of Enshi was a master of his generation, presiding over the literary scene for decades. Sadly, he passed away from a stroke at the age of eighty-six. Mr. Zengxiang wrote over 20,000 poems in his lifetime, in addition to those already published. His last work was the *Danjing Jue Movie Song*, written last winter, dedicated to painters Qi Baishi and Lin Shixing. The song says: “The shadow play of the Song dynasty first flourished in Funing. Carved and painted figures were covered with fabric. Yan Shi controlled them to sing and dance, the sun and moon did not shine, but light was in the lamp.” (See Lu Huiqing's words to Jinggong). More than seven hundred years have passed since then. The production in the South and North is exquisite. Round heads and square feet cannot be seen, as stiff as a single layer of paper. The island nations emerged late and excelled at lascivious ingenuity, using electricity to photograph and display all shapes. Appearing on stage, one might think they are wandering in a mirror palace, with everything possessing emotion. It is a pity that the Europeans and Americans imitate the licentious Zheng and Wei, probing waists like willows, lips kissing cherries. The Japanese in the East intend to rectify the customs, striving for elegance and correctness. The Chinese are addicted to calligraphy and painting, spending millions annually to collect Wu silk. Qi Baishi drinks wine and writes poems madly, while Lin Shixing's machine hums and the lamp flickers. They use the two painters as directors, allowing the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou to display their abilities. Paintings within paintings, shadows within shadows, a refined pursuit promoted by Ito. Qiaolin discussed painting with Qi, and the beauties were all talented students. Qi has a white beard and exuberant spirit, Lin has curly hair and a fluffy head. Short cloth clothes tailored for Zhou Bokang, patched robes of a thin Lan Cheng. The ninth month is warm and pleasant, the east fence chrysanthemums bloom, and the sun shines. The two worthy ones take off their clothes, their energy boundless, and place the jade at the end of the stream in the middle of the courtyard. Cao Yi's and Wu Dai's styles differ, the rough and the delicate, the gods and the ghosts are amazed. Yongqiu Su Mi joins the long table, and a hundred sheets of Xuan paper are filled in a day. Once the beauty is painted, they freely inscribe and comment, and all in Runan give genuine evaluations. From entering the door to commenting on the painting, the divine skill and ingenious design require laborious operation. One painting reflects the medicine mirror, one lamp presents a shadow on the gauze screen. Each person has a state without profanity, scholars are crazy and beautiful, women are chaste. The shadow of the cicada emerges a thousand feet, Ito rolls the paper back to Tokyo. The Easterners love Fanshan's brush, regretting the lack of a Huafei Pavilion in the shadows.” The film *Danjing Jue* was filmed by Ito Weixiong of Yokohama Bank of Japan, and directed by the Chinese painters Qi Baishi and Lin Shisheng. Therefore, the poem speaks of this. Using this as a subject, if someone else were to do it, they would not know where to start. Mr. Fanshan liked to make it difficult for himself, lifting weights as if they were light. He was indeed worthy of being the leader of the literary scene. According to records, Mr. Fanshan was a Jinshi of the Xuning Dingmao period. He served as the Jiangning Administration Commissioner, where he had a good reputation for his administration, but it was all overshadowed by his reputation as a poet. After the founding of the Republic, he became a recluse in Chunming, living leisurely and rewarding and supporting actors. Many male and female actors became famous because of him. The reasons for his death this year, as rumored outside, are mostly untrue. As far as I know, Mr. Zeng attended a climb in Tianjin on the Double Ninth Festival last year at the invitation of Cao Jingyuan. After arriving in Tianjin, Mr. Chen Taoan and Mr. Xia Shouting increased his direct salary because of his age, and there was a word from Shangshu Fan. The Qing court suddenly sent letters to various newspapers, declaring it a false impersonation. Mr. Zeng was unhappy for many days. Later, his most beloved granddaughter died of illness. Mr. Zeng mourned her. From then on, his appetite decreased and his thoughts became pessimistic. Soon after, he fell and injured his foot. After healing, he fell again and could not get up. But he still did not stop composing poems. Later, he suffered from aphasia due to a stroke. The medicine was ineffective, and he passed away suddenly. Because he did not speak, there were no last words. And the last work, the *Danjing Jue Movie Song*, was written before the aphasia from the stroke while languishing in bed.</p>

<p>— Tian Xiang</p>
<p>The Aviation Sixth Team of the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs is practicing parachute jumping. This is a very rare event in our country. Here is a brief description of the parachute jumping at that time.</p>
<p>In preparation for this parachute jumping practice, team leader Huang Yupai and squad leader Chen Xihong first tested it to train the team. First of all, all the pilots in the team were taught parachute theory and jumping methods by Mr. Huang. On the first day of parachute jumping practice, all pilots gathered at the airport at 2:00 p.m. to listen to all the preparations for parachute jumping before taking off.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Deep Water and Scorching Fire <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Jiu</p>
<p>Take-off. The plane for the parachute jumping practice was the Kesai No. 604. The driver was Deputy Team Leader Huang Yuquan. After the test drive was completed, Huang sat on the lower left wing and Squad Leader Chen sat on the lower right wing. They took off at 3:00 p.m., circled the city once, and flew east to the southern corner of Xiaolingwei. At that time, the plane's altitude was about 2,000 feet. Team Leaders Huang and Chen immediately jumped off the plane.</p>
<p>Parachute Jumping. After the parachutists left the plane, both parachutes opened simultaneously not long after. The distance was about two zhang. With the blowing of the east wind, they slowly descended in about three minutes and landed safely on the old teacher training ground. At that time, the audience applauded and cheered to express their congratulations. Deputy Team Leader Huang also drove the original plane and flew low with the two parachutes in the low altitude of the landing point. He soared until Team Leaders Huang and Chen took a car back to the airport.</p>
<p>Landing. The original plan was to land at Zhongshan Ao outside Zhongshan Gate. Later, after team leader Huang personally drove the plane to survey it, he recognized that there was a lot of accumulated water and many trees there, and the insurance parachute might be damaged. Therefore, it was changed to the old teacher training ground. Finally, Huang and Chen reported the situation in detail to the director and returned to the team headquarters to rest. It was already dusk.</p>
<h3 id="e151">In Memory of an Art Benefactor <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Shanzi</p>
<p>This year's floods in various provinces are unprecedented. All sectors of Shanghai are rising up to help out of neighborly friendship and disaster relief. It shows that the heart of compassion is shared by all. The artistic community is engaged in brushwork and ink cultivation, and the inkstone field is not abundant. Recently, I have followed in the footsteps of Mr. Wang Yiting, Di Chuqing, and Li Zuhan to engage in large-scale cooperation and will hold an emergency calligraphy and painting exhibition to do our best. My friend Yu Jianhua, a heroic man from Shandong, just returned from sketching in Yandang Mountain. Hearing my words, he immediately offered to donate all one hundred pieces of his third solo exhibition to help with disaster relief. It has been tentatively scheduled to be held in the lobby of the New World Hotel on September 4th, 5th, and 6th. Jianhua has been sketching in Yandang Mountain for more than a month, with its strange peaks, layered peaks, famous pools, and strange waterfalls, which has reached the great view of the world. And he has added majestic brush and ink, and a vast atmosphere, so that the painting and the mountain complement each other. He is also skilled in birds, beasts, figures, and Buddha statues, but he has kept them deeply secret, and no one knows them. Now, for the sake of disaster relief, he has exhausted all his skills. Moreover, the price is low, so that everyone can buy it. The cost is not much, but you can get exquisite masterpieces and save suffering compatriots. It is the greatest joy to do good. Why not do it? I think that at that time, they will definitely rush to be the first and be sold out in an instant. (Move the reward to help with disaster relief)</p>
<h3 id="e152">Random Thoughts on Ms. Yang Manhua's Trip to Europe (3) <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The ambassadors and consuls dispatched by the country represent the country to the outside world. Therefore, the honor and disgrace of the ambassadors and consuls in the host country are naturally closely related to the honor and disgrace of the country. Among the ambassadors and consuls sent by our country to various European countries, how many can have international credibility and diplomatic skills? The overseas Chinese and students in Europe are very clear about this. Some people say that they are commendable for serving the public on an empty stomach and do not need strict criticism. Others say that to be an ambassador or consul in our country, one must be a capitalist who can raise funds to be competent. Otherwise, they will often be poor. How can they settle in their positions? Although the words are funny, they are also close to human nature. It is said that the poverty of embassies and consulates did not start today. However, in recent years, the situation has deteriorated. For example, when it comes to our country's National Day or major anniversaries, it is customary to invite foreign guests to hold grand ceremonies. The meaning is to celebrate the prosperity of the country and to connect with the feelings of various friendly countries. In the past, embassies and consulates must have a feast to entertain distinguished guests. Last year, due to insufficient funding, tea parties were held instead. Judging from the current situation, I am afraid that even tea parties will not be possible in the future. The country that pays the most attention to face in the international arena is Japan. They can especially save on the budget for government administrative expenses, but the funding for embassies and consulates abroad is very sufficient. Just comparing this point, we have already been dwarfed.</p>
<p>Few Europeans understand the situation in the East. Some people do not even distinguish between Chinese and Japanese. When they see a majestic and polite Chinese person, they open their mouths and ask (Are you Japanese?). And the relatively short Japanese are mistaken for Chinese. The Japanese take the opportunity to act stupid and theoretical, as if saying that he is Chinese is insulting to him. To be honest, the Chinese are so base that they do all kinds of evil. How can we Japanese compare to them? These people believe it to be true and almost regard the Chinese as an inferior nation. The Japanese, with ill intentions, are making trouble for us everywhere. Everyone must keep this in mind. One day, we went to a village in Belgium, and many women were fighting to see my feet. I stretched them out for them to see, and then they calmed their curiosity. One woman said. (We have never seen Chinese people before, but we have heard since childhood that Chinese people have tails. (That is, braids) They all want to marry concubines. Women all have small feet and walk with a sway. Now I understand that this is not true. Please forgive our misjudgment.) Another person who thought he was familiar with the situation in East Asia said with a mocking attitude. (How tyrannical are the Chinese warlords? There are bandits everywhere. People are living a hellish life.) He said a lot of such untrue words. I said (This kind of rumor is completely unfounded.) A gentleman who was traveling with me also responded with a very funny remark. (I think you there will know the Great Republic of China that has been established for thousands of years. After our revolution succeeds, we will simply use a microscope to illuminate your Belgium.) Then everyone laughed and dispersed. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e153">Random Notes on Northeast Exploration (7) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Sui Jiu</p>
<p>(XI) The Source of Thought</p>
<p>The Manchu Qing Dynasty relied on Hong Chengchou's plan to determine the world, but it also failed due to Hong's (ten no's) strategy. The power of thought is more powerful than money and guns. The Japanese are running Manchuria and Mongolia, using libraries as design rooms and the ideological system obtained from research institutes as guidelines. All agricultural and industrial development is orderly and not rashly undertaken. Even a supremely materialistic country like Soviet Russia has a (five-year plan) as a guideline for the country's entire development. Therefore, how can we despise thought or knowledge and rush to pursue money?</p>
<p>Libraries and schools are factories for manufacturing thought. The Japanese are running our Northeast, and libraries and schools or other research institutions related to specialized academics are the driving force behind all their Manchuria and Mongolia undertakings. In addition to the Fengtian Library in Shenyang, there is the South Manchuria Medical University. Lushun has a technical university, and Dalian has a vocational specialty school and a commercial specialty school. I once visited the South Manchuria Medical University through the introduction of Mr. Kuroda Genji. Mr. Kuroda studied in Germany for many years and obtained a doctorate. He is now a professor at the school. He teaches six hours a week at the school. He has a research room on the second floor of the school. The room is equipped with books and a blackboard. Students sometimes enter his private room to listen to lectures. He led me to visit the Chinese medicine bookstore. The four walls of bookshelves are filled with various Chinese medical books, such as the Huangdi Neijing. There are also many rare books. He earnestly guides and explains, and often expresses that the school pays special attention to the collection of Chinese medicine books. And there are achievements. There is also a huge room full of various Chinese medicinal material specimens. The names and origins are marked separately in glass bottles for storage and display. It is said that the school is specially studying the Chinese Northeast's Materia Medica. The Dalian Manchuria and Mongolia Resources Museum originally had a specialized department for scientifically testing Manchuria and Mongolia native medicinal materials. It has now been merged into the school. In previous years, I saw in the Dalian Manchuria and Mongolia Resources Museum a systematic explanation of the scientific testing of Chinese medicinal materials, so that people can know how a certain medicine is made at a glance. For example, the steps of mint making mint oil, using raw materials to display a line connecting the change system, is very simple and clear.</p>
<p>(XII) Northeast Thought Factory</p>
<p>Japanese specialized scholars are engaged in the thought manufacturing of how to run our Northeast. Their various institutions in our Northeast are engaged in specialized research on a certain problem in Manchuria and Mongolia. As for the Northeast Thought Factory on our country's side, the first to be recommended is Northeast University. However, the school's administrative aspects still need to be improved, and a concrete plan for the development of the Northeast should be urgently established.</p>
<p>Outside the Dadongmen of Shenyang, there is the Liaoning Provincial Library, which was founded in October of the 34th year of Guangxu. There are a total of 94,984 books. Since the librarian Bian Hongnuo took over, the organization has been quite successful. Mr. Bian is a professor at the Education Institute of Northeast University and has a great ambition to organize Northeast literature. Since I have lived in Shenyang, I have deeply felt the need to organize Northeast literature with scientific methods. I think Mr. Bian will continue to work hard. Now I heard that Mr. Bian has been transferred to the principal of the Northeast Mongolia Normal School. The former principal of the school was Mr. Guo Daofu. Mr. Guo is from Hulunbuir and was the party representative of the Mongolian Youth Party who declared independence from China during the Communist Party uprising in Hailar in previous years. Mr. Guo has been to Russia twice and can speak some Russian. He has great ambitions and wants to inherit Genghis Khan's business. At that time, he united with Russia to seek Mongolian independence. Later, Zhang Xueliang asked someone to persuade him. His thinking changed and he became anti-Russian. He took the position of Zhang's secretary and served as the principal of the Mongolian school concurrently. The Hailar problem was solved at the same time. Mr. Guo is bold, energetic and likes to talk. He comes to Northeast University to visit me from afternoon to midnight. He is the only one who speaks eloquently, all about the history of Genghis Khan. I and Mr. Li Zhenggang hosted him at Residence No. 18, Xixin Village, inside the university. Sometimes Mr. Long Bochun also sits in and drinks tea, which is a good way to relieve loneliness.</p>
<p>Outside the provincial library, there are 42 county libraries in the province. However, some libraries have only 400 to 500 books, while Taonan County, Tieling County, and Liaoyang County have as many as 10,000 books. Libraries and schools are both thought factories. The solution to the Chinese Northeast problem depends on these two. I further say that the competition between China and Japan in Manchuria and Mongolia is especially led by cultural undertakings.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Fluctuations in Financial Bidding Gold Last Week <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The future looks uncertain. Bidding gold fluctuated greatly last week. It seemed unstoppable. It first weakened at the beginning of the week, with daily differences of more than ten taels. It once broke through the 770 tael mark. Afterwards, there were also occasional rebounds of seven or eight taels, forming a swirling pattern. At the weekend, it turned upward again, exceeding the 80 tael mark. This was mostly due to the fluctuations in the overseas silver market and the Shanghai exchange rate. However, there were no special overseas news. The silver market rose slightly during the week, and the exchange rate was balanced. There were occasional inflows and outflows in the gold industry, and the hedging became closer and closer. It has now been reduced to less than ten taels, only six or seven taels. If British gold is sold, it is even smaller, only three or four taels. Therefore, previous transactions have been greatly hit. As for the gold price, it was actually caused by a certain bank engaged in purchasing and absorbing cash very strongly. It is found that the current inventory is only more than 10,000. More than 10,000 bars were shipped to the United States on Thursday this week. However, red bars have not been selling well recently, so the price has fallen from 9.5 taels to 7.5 taels (based on the increasing bid). The closing price is gradually approaching, initially at more than 40 taels, and finally only pressing 20 taels. According to investigations, Yongheng, Xinheng, Qianchang, Xianghong, Xing, etc. are all long positions. The short positions include the Dalian gang, Daxing, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanmao, Yong and spot dealers, such as Wu. The total amount of gold transactions is about 44,500 bars. The future gold market still needs to be swirling, but I am afraid there is no downward trend. The general situation of the week is summarized below.</p>
<p>The few changes experienced since Monday (August 24) was that the big notes did not change, and the first order was as before. The gold market opened slightly lower, at 778 taels. The private telegram silver price reported a increase of 125, followed by 79 taels 3 qian. There seemed to be more buyers. Later, there were slight ups and downs, reaching 72 taels. Then Lu et al. sold, eventually closing at 64 taels 5 jiao, and the closing price increased by 4 to 5 taels, to 68 taels 8 qian, a sharp drop of 10 taels 0.7 qian compared to last Saturday. According to the daily calculation, there was a rebound of 14 taels 8 jiao. It was true that the cash from a certain bank had not been shipped out. Since the first order was also loose, people's hearts turned empty. The next morning, the big notes reported an increase from 125 to 1875, the silver price increased by half a point, and the first order hung at 25. In the afternoon, it suddenly shrank by 125, and the domestic market seemed tight, showing a strong inside and outside. The bidding gold opened down by 1 tael 3 qian, totaling 767 taels 5, then the big households Wu et al. sold, and after the first order was placed, it suddenly fell to 62 taels. Wu then chased in, and the major households bought one after another. And the exchange rate was reported to be small, so the mid-day price rose to 70 taels, totaling 75 taels 2 qian, and the closing price was 3 taels 9 qian. The afternoon opened at 5 taels, and then the first order changed to shrinking, totaling 77 taels 9 qian. However, as a result, more positions seemed to be bought, falling back to 76 taels 8 qian, 8 taels higher than the previous day. There was a difference of 15 taels 9 qian on the day, and the changes were very drastic. On Wednesday, the big notes shrank by 0.0625, the silver market was 0.25, and the first order shrank by half a grade. The internal market was very flat, and transactions were limited. The bidding gold opened down by 2 taels, totaling 774 taels 8 qian, because the big notes shrank too much. Then a certain bank and big households bought in, and since the first order had shrunk, it rose to 79 taels 1 qian. Then there was more selling downstream, and the mid-day price was 2 taels 8 qian, and the closing price was 3 taels 1 qian. In the afternoon, Hamaguchi of Japan died, and it fell by more than 2 taels, from 74 taels to 1 tael 5 jiao. Then it rose slightly, and the closing price was 74 taels 4 jiao, 2 taels 4 qian less than the previous day. There were ups and downs of 7 taels 6 qian. The next day, the big notes rose by 0.0625, the silver price was 1.25, and the first order hung at half a grade. The internal market seemed loose. As for the gold market, it opened at 771 taels, a small drop of 3 taels 4 qian. There were still many sellers, and it suddenly reached 67 taels. Later, the buyers were quick and rose to 71 taels 8 qian. The mid-day closing price was 70 taels. The afternoon opened flat, and then there were more buyers, rising to 75 taels. However, the closing price was 72 taels 6 qian, only 1 tael 8 qian less than the previous day, and there were also ups and downs of 8 taels. The market had more supply than demand. On Friday, the big notes rose again by 0.0625, the US silver price did not change, and the first order also had no change. However, there were quite a few transactions in the internal market, and the Guang gang slightly scraped, and the price slightly rebounded, eventually becoming peaceful. The bidding gold opened down by 1 tael 1 qian, totaling 771 taels 5. At mid-day, the sellers were active, falling back to 70 taels, totaling 69 taels 8 qian. The mid-day closing price turned flat, totaling 72 taels. In the afternoon, it fell to 71 taels 4 qian. A certain bank then bought in and moved forward all the way. The closing price was 77 taels, a rise of 4 taels 4 qian compared to the previous day. There was a rebound of 7 taels 2 qian throughout the day. On Saturday, the big notes shrank by 0.0625, the US silver price decreased by 1.25, and the first order hung at half a grade. The internal market also rose, but transactions were limited. It was really because the hedging was too close and unsuitable. The bidding gold opened up by 4 taels, totaling 781 taels. The big notes had a good base, the United States sold near term, and people's hearts were moving upward. Then there seemed to be more sellers, falling back to 79 taels 5 jiao. The trend then tended to be excellent, and a certain bank advanced with force, returning to the 80 tael mark. The mid-day price reached 84 taels 6 jiao 9 qian. The closing price was 82 taels, stimulated by the Guang gang's selling, and continued to rise by 5 taels 5 qian compared to the previous day. There was a rebound of 5 taels 1 qian in half a day. On the 20th, the big notes reported a further decline. Will the gold price open high today (30th)? The high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as the bidding gold for exchange rates, are described separately below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the money market tightened again due to the weekend and bank holidays. The morning interbank loan rate was 1.8%, and the afternoon rate was 1.9%.

Money shops received over 3.3 million in silver public notes, over 37 million in silver public notes, over 700,000 in remittances from various routes, and over 300,000 in money shop transactions.

<p>Securities Settlement and the Weekly Bond Market Report</p>
<p>Only Four Days of Trading, Market Conditions Were Flat</p>
<p>Prices Fluctuated Slightly, Continuing a Steady Downward Trend</p>
<p>Last week, due to the end-of-month settlement period, there were only four days of trading, excluding Thursday and Friday when the market was closed for settlement. August futures were only traded for the first two days of the week, while October futures began trading on Saturday. Looking at the daily market performance, Tuesday was relatively active, with a volume of 22.2 million yuan. The beginning and end of the week each saw 12.13 million yuan. Wednesday was quiet, with only September futures traded, and everyone was preparing for settlement, leading to a lack of enthusiasm. The market was extremely quiet, with only a few hundred thousand yuan traded, a total of 51.085 million yuan for the whole week, a decrease of about 28 million yuan from the previous week. The internal consolidated tax was higher, at 14.005 million yuan, while the 20 Customs was at 12.8 million. Other issues were quiet, such as the 19 Customs at 6.36 million, the 20 Consolidation at 5.5 million, the Disbandment at 4.195 million yuan, the 19 Charity at 4.06 million yuan, the Demobilization at 2.72 million yuan, the 96 Public Bonds at 1.245 million yuan, the Reorganization 6% at 760,000, the Customs Duty at 400,500 yuan, and the Financial 7-Year at only tens of thousands of yuan. The spot market was also very quiet, with only 17,500 yuan traded for the entire week. Regarding the price movements of various bonds over the four days last week, the overall situation remained calm, with no changes in the bond market environment. During the settlement period, everyone was focused on settlement matters, so the market was quiet and demand was balanced. Large investors remained on the sidelines, with most activity consisting of small-scale buying and selling. Daily fluctuations were minimal. However, with the recent issuance of several new bonds, the market felt a sense of uncertainty due to supply and demand, and prices tended to fluctuate downwards. As a result, most issues were weaker compared to the previous week, with the exception of the Disbandment September issue, which fell by 1.8 yuan, and the 20 Customs September issue, which fell by 1 yuan. Other issues fell by only 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. Only the Reorganization 6%, Customs Duty, Disbandment, 19 Customs, and Charity issues saw slight increases. Looking at the bond market situation, it is likely to remain sluggish for the time being, without significant fluctuations. It is also said that the newly issued 20-Year Salt Tax Treasury Bonds will be launched at the beginning of the month. The following is a statistical summary of the high, low, and differential prices of various bonds last week (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e157">Yarn and Cotton: No Honor or Disgrace in the Yarn Market Last Week <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Sichuan Merchants Are Currently More Active</p>
<p>The yarn market showed no clear signs of honor or disgrace last week, but the overall trend was very weak. Frequent floods in various regions and a serious situation have inevitably dampened autumn sales, so there are still many sellers. A certain large merchant has been actively covering his short positions in recent months, but there has been no action in the far months. The amount purchased by Rongxing Company has also remained unchanged. Both sides have considerable opposition. Midway, due to the poor surrounding environment, there was a downward trend, with each month falling by two taels. Before long, American cotton rebounded slightly, the rise in the price of grade three yarn became more intense, and the price of gold was also high. The settlement price of August standard yarn was also good, and the market showed signs of tightening. As a result, the price of standard yarn in each month was similar to the previous week, with no rise or fall. The total transaction volume was 125,500 bales. The sales of current yarn by foreign merchants were flat, but Sichuan merchants were still keen to purchase. Other merchants showed very little activity. The total amount purchased by various merchants was 5,805 bales, and 1,225 bales were purchased by fellow merchants. The market was calm. Japanese merchants opened prices for 11th and 12th month futures of 20-count Blue Phoenix Hongxi and other yarns, totaling more than 10,000 bales. The prices were relatively low. The price of grade three yarn rose by 4.5 yuan compared to the previous week. The following is a breakdown of the number of bales purchased by various merchants:</p>
<p>Merchant	Bales	Merchant	Bales	Merchant	Bales</p>
<p>Inland	600	Yunnan	100	Ningbo	100</p>
<p>Hankou	200	Shantou	100	Tianjin	345</p>

<p>Both Spot Cotton Arrivals and Sales are Quiet</p>
<p>At the beginning of last week, the cotton market was shaken by the onslaught of gales and rainstorms, and buying sentiment prevailed in the market. Short sellers showed signs of panic. At the same time, American cotton also rose slightly, and Japanese merchants made purchases, further fueling the rise. Shanghai cotton merchants had a strong bullish sentiment. Due to severe floods in various regions and low inventories of old cotton, as well as low prices for American cotton, they rushed to buy. However, the global situation remains one of oversupply, so the American cotton market remained stable with minimal fluctuations. Factories showed no interest in domestic cotton, and imports of foreign cotton continued to increase daily. The future trend will still depend on the movements of American and Indian cotton. However, most people in Shanghai believe that the floods have severely damaged the harvest, and that foreign cotton prices are fixed with too many short positions and high gold prices. Given the right opportunity, there may be a rebound. The Hankou standard price rose by 6-7 qian compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume was 462,900 dan, with no source. American cotton rose by 40 pounds compared to the previous week. The following is a breakdown of the purchase prices and number of bales of foreign cotton purchased by various factories:</p>
<p>Factory	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Transaction Volume</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices were firm due to excessive rainfall, short covering, and a lack of willing sellers. Futures prices rose by 6 to 8 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 4 points, and spot prices rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton prices were firm due to short covering, with Pingguoer rising by 2.25 rupees, Aomula rising by 3 rupees, and Bairoxi rising by 2.875 rupees. The original telegram is on the left.

<h3 id="e161">A Gloomy View of the Future of American Cotton <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>A daily report states that the proposal to halt American cotton planting for one year originated from Governor Long of Louisiana. As a result, a meeting of governors and upper and lower house members from various states was convened on the 21st to discuss the feasibility of enacting state laws. The urgency of the matter is evident. The new cotton estimate released eight days ago was 15.6 million bales. Combined with the previous season's carryover, there is a total of over 24.5 million bales, which is the largest ever, and is more than enough to supply the world for two years. The sharp decline in prices is unprecedented in 30 years. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the Federal Farm Board, the agency in charge of relief, proposed a desperate measure to cotton-producing states a few days ago to destroy one-third of the cotton trees currently growing, amounting to approximately 5 million bales. Based on the current market price of 7 US cents per pound, the value of 5 million bales is equivalent to 700 million yuan, which is a large loss of value, making it difficult to implement. So, what is the trend of the American cotton market, and what is the observation of the New York cotton industry? According to New York sources, the general decline of the industrial and commercial sectors and the huge supply of cotton suggest that the American cotton market may decline further. However, due to the delay in the shipment of new cotton, there is a possibility of a temporary rebound. Since August 1st, cotton production has been relatively smooth. If the government's September estimate is as expected, then the market price may be difficult to avoid falling. The extent of the decline is unclear even to the cotton industry. However, given that there is no hope of a drastic reduction in harvesting and no signs of improvement in the economy, if the government does not take effective countermeasures, the market price may reach a new low during the peak season for new cotton. (The lowest record in November 1898 was 5.31 cents). To what extent can lower prices increase consumption and reduce planting next year, will have a significant impact on the future market. However, the government is unlikely to let things go. After former Farm Board Director Alexander Legge joined the American Cotton Stabilization Corporation, the Farm Board announced the cotton abandonment plan, followed by Governor Long's one-year suspension plan. If it cannot be implemented, there may be other countermeasures announced.</p>

<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>At that time, in order to prevent the enemy from having time to replenish their forces, and to facilitate the withdrawal of American troops and their transfer to the Meuse-Argonne offensive, the Battle of Saint-Mihiel was reduced to nine divisions around September 10th. The objective of the operation was limited to clearing the Paris-Avricourt railway line. In other words, I could calmly direct the Battle of Meuse-Argonne. I reduced the scope of the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and requested Commander Pershing to take charge of the new offensive.</p>
<p>Before leaving Ligny, I summarized and detailed the points we had discussed and handed them to Commander Pershing. The American Commander-in-Chief used this as a basis and wrote to me on August 31st, based on his observations.</p>
<p>To alleviate difficulties and avoid wasting time, Commander Pershing, Commander Pétain, and myself convened at my headquarters on September 2nd. We used the reply I had sent to Commander Pershing the day before as the basis for the meeting. The content was as follows:</p>
<p>My written and verbal opinions on the Allied General Offensive on August 30th:</p>
<p>(1) In the predetermined direction,</p>
<p>(2) With the maximum force of the Allied forces,</p>
<p>(3) In the shortest possible time,</p>
<p>(4) Under the best conditions of supply and transportation.</p>
<p>The American plan of operation:</p>
<p>(A) Reduce the scope of the offensive towards Saint-Mihiel.</p>
<p>(B) Launch an offensive west of the Meuse River. This aspect of the war must be fully maintained.</p>
<p>If you believe that the offensive against Saint-Mihiel, even with a reduced scope, cannot be undertaken in advance or simultaneously, it should be abandoned. However, in any case, preparations for the battle west of the Meuse River must be made immediately. Please come to my headquarters at 2:00 PM tomorrow, September 2nd, to discuss and formulate the operational outline with Commander Pétain and myself.</p>
<p>At the meeting, after reviewing the American units capable of undertaking the offensive, Commander Pershing acknowledged that the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne offensive did not overlap, but required rapid mutual coordination. The plan was then decided as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The preparation for the attack on Saint-Mihiel will be carried out with eight to ten divisions on September 10th.</p>
<p>(2) The offensive west of the Meuse River will be carried out by the American forces (twelve to fourteen divisions) between September 20th and 25th in the area between the Meuse River and the Argonne Forest. The French Fourth Army will assist on the left flank. The entire army will be under the command of Commander Pétain.</p>
<p>This decision was immediately notified to both commanders-in-chief as the preliminary for the general directive on the following day, September 3rd.</p>
<p>After negotiations and changes to the plan, the military operations at Saint-Mihiel were launched. However, due to (extreme disorganization of concentrated action), the operation had to be postponed for another forty-eight hours.</p>
<p>On September 12th, three thousand cannons bombarded for four hours. The main battle units (American Fourth and First Corps) began their offensive from the line of Xipré-Apremont towards the Thiaucourt valley at 5:00 AM. They advanced wave after wave, fiercely attacking, and the enemy could not resist. After the densely laid barbed wire obstacles were breached, the defensive centers were successively captured. The army continued to advance and reached all objectives by evening.</p>
<p>At that time, the secondary battle unit (American Fifth Corps) also launched an offensive from the front line of Heiche at 8:00 AM, advancing with similar speed. They reached Hattonchâtel that evening. On the morning of the 13th, contact was established between the main and secondary attacks.</p>
<p>The enemy had held the Saint-Mihiel salient for four years, but it was captured by our army in a few hours. The German army was unable to retreat completely, and 13,250 prisoners and 460 cannons were captured by our army. (To be continued)</p>
