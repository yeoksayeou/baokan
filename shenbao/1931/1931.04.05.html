<p>世界事毁壞易而成功難每一大問題起經多數人之努力。多方面之奔走。又歷無數波折變幻而始有初步成功之望。但此初步成功之望尚未可恃也進行苟遇困難。則前功即可盡棄。此種事例甚多。如此次法意間之海軍恊定經英外相努力調解而成世皆謂爲實行軍縮之初步。已有成功希望。然據今日巴黎電。法意海約已發現嚴重形勢。最困難處在將法意兩國主力新艦若干噸分别加入艦隊一條三國專家解釋互異。法外長會晤意英兩使後政界深慮談判將陷停頓。又據倫敦電。起草法意海約之專家。現藉復活節假均回國一行。目下所遇之重大困難仍未解决。其要點一爲法國要求明白規定此次協定與法所讓步。俱係臨時性質日後不能援爲成例二日本堅持關於第一章主力艦與飛機母艦之條文。不能解釋爲變更華會條約與倫敦條約。美亦同具此意。據此兩電以觀。則法意協定之是否成功。今尚在未可預知之數。前此法意報紙欣然樂觀該約之成功者。今又作悲觀論調。豈非世事成功之難之一證乎</p>
<p>推而言之經營數年將近成功之歐洲關稅休戰協定今亦因一二國之未　准。而已全部取銷白里安之歐洲大聯邦計劃。又因德奥關稅協定而進行發生困難德奥協定又因他國反對而進行亦甚不易非又爲前說之一證乎。</p>

<p>華中體育之近况</p>
<p>華中體、育湖南素極發達、惟自匪共陷長沙後、學校悉遭焚毁、敎育大受打擊、體育亦隨之俱去</p>
<p>恢復頗形困難、贛省則正陷於匪難、川省交通關係、殊少接近、故當以武漢爲中心、武漢大學尚屬早創、尚在發展中、漢口體育雖甚稚幼、經靑年會及漢體協會、極力提倡頗著成績、籃足球隊、組織紛起籃球以靑年會隊實力最富、足球則推三育及市政府二隊但經濟竭蹶、又無適宜塲地、故發展遲遲云、</p>
<p>劉文島熱心提倡</p>
<p>此次華中足球隊東下、經濟困難異常預費須一千餘元、初僅籌得四百餘元、漢口市長劉文島氏乃慨然個人捐助三百元、提倡體育、備具熱心、再漢口無適宜足球塲、僅中由公園一片荒地與西人比賽、須往西商跑馬廳、受其招待雖感實慚、市政府乃通過一議案、籌經費洋九十萬元、建築一大規模運動塲、於九月前完成第五屆華中運動會、將於此舉行、劉氏正積極籌備、將來華中體育之提倡、有賴於劉氏之提倡者甚多、</p>
<p>參国分區賽動機</p>
<p>宋如海君提倡體育、不遺餘力、現服務漢口靑年會、靑年會籃球隊即由其訓練而成宋氏鑒於華中體育之黯無生氣、乃努力鼓吹組織足球隊參加全國分區賽、經種種困難、代表隊卒以產生、此行目的、全在聯絡各方、及鼓起華中體育之興趣、明知技術之不如人惟勝負非所計也、</p>
<p>代表及經費由來</p>
<p>華中代表隊、大半由漢口市政府及三育體育會兩足球選出、曾約九江同文足球比賽、同文去年以一比○獲華中足球錦標、今則以一比二敗於漢口隊、最後乃决由漢口代表、曾去電約同文參加、惟入選隊員未來爲憾、經費由市政府足球隊捐三百四十六元、並劉市長捐三百元、所短尚鉅、現全國體育協會沈嗣良允極力設法云、</p>
<p>華中足球隊陣線</p>
<p>該隊除參加分區賽外、將再有數次友誼賽領隊宋如海、幹事孫洪烈·唐性天書記趙蘭泉、陣線如下、</p>

<p>實業部長孔祥熙演詞江蘇爲東南漁業最重要地方、以嵊山漁港一處而論、蘇浙閩三省漁船、均匯集該地、何止數千艘、其他呂泗新洋港等、均是海產豐富、漁船密集之地故總理實業計畫内、就有將各港建築漁業港之規定、上海爲中國惟一通商大埠、本國之鹽鮮魚類、合外海内河所產、年銷約二千萬、而外國海產品之銷售及通過者、每年幾近五千萬元、故上海實爲海產物暢銷之大市塲、江蘇省黨務整理委員會、農鑛廳、上海市市黨部市政府、江蘇省立漁業試騐場、鑒於水產物在江蘇地位之重要、及其銷路之廣大、而深惜社會人士對於此項企業漠然不甚注意、遂有聯合組織改進漁業宣傳會之舉、以新式漁法圖書標本陳列會塲、任人參觀以促進社會對於漁業之注意而誘起其企業心、鄙人對此、甚爲贊許、敝部爲漁業行政最高主管機關深知沿海漁民、顚連困苦之現狀、故成立至今、雖僅四閱月、以消極方面而論、已提請國務會議、通過豁免魚稅漁業稅、以解除歷年來漁民之痛苦、至於積極方面、對於提倡保護、改良取締諸端、均在竭力進行、未敢或懈計可爲諸位報告者有四、（一）關於提倡者、如遠洋漁業奬勵金之計畫實因鑒於我國漁業界　乏企業觀念、對於遠洋漁業、不甚注意、故特於二十年度國家預算内、列入遠洋漁業奬勵金二十五萬元、並擬咨商沿海七省於省預算内、亦提出相當奬金、以奬勵新造之遠洋漁輪、以覓倡渞導遠洋漁業之先聲（二）關於保護者擬在沿海七省、設立保護漁業專管機關四所、購置通艦專以防止海匪保護漁業之安全、（三）關於改良者、漁業與各種機械工業不同因海洋情况氣候、關係魚類之生長、及其棲息之所、亦各異、故漁具之宜於甲國、未必適用於乙國所以一國魚類捕撈製造養殖等技術之精良、實賴乎豐富之經騐而經騐之獲得、有賴乎試騐本部擬於二十年度列入五十萬元國家預算、規劃中央模範水產試騐塲之設立、從事試騐漁撈製造養殖等課、並附設宣傳講習二部、以試騐所得、傳習於漁民間、使經營水產事業者有所借鏡、（四）關於取締者、年來外國漁船侵漁、報紙所載各位都已深知、敝部對此尤爲注意迭經國務會議討論並與各關係　會商取締辦法、現在一部份已得解决、尚有應待交涉者除當隨時與外交部協商進行總期達到圓滿解决之目的爲止總之國家事業之建設、須人民與政府雙方合作、始有成效現在我國漁業衰落已達極點、所有應興應革各端、不一而足然我人者能上下一致、努力前進、則已經衰落之漁業、不難於最短内復興、而今日此會之舉行、非但爲不虛、且將大有造於我沿海漁業之改進、是則敝部所自勉、亦當與諸君共勉之焉</p>
<p>社會局長潘公展演說市社會局長潘公展致詞、略謂我們一方面看一看中國沿海漁業的不景氣、一方面看一看外輪侵漁之亟迫、知道在今日來舉行這一個改進宣傳會實在是緩無可緩、同時我們知道欲謀漁業的改進、首先要注意到漁業的銷費方面、因爲魚類最易腐化、萬一銷費不推廣則生產量雖增加、結果以無法推銷之故、亦不過以最低價銷售、或竟腐爛抛棄、例如現在上海所有漁輪、去年因日本魚大批推銷本埠、卒致魚價低落、營業有不能維持之勢、假如現在中國漁業、在生產方面驟然增加、新式漁輪、一旦多至數倍或數十倍、我相信結果、亦必仍趨失敗、所以我們一方面要開發江蘇的漁業、同時尤不在上海方面、謀推銷費事業的建設、因爲上海是江浙兩省漁業的集中地、又爲國際商塲之一、本會不在生產區域舉行、而在上海舉行、其意就是爲此云云、</p>
<p>農鑛廳長何玉書答詞中國沿海漁業、衰落已極、如不再謀改進、吾沿海數百萬漁民、就從此完了、完了數百萬漁民、就從此了事、還可說得、惟是帝國主義的勢力乘機侵入、還不但僅僅完了我數百萬漁民生計而已、並且危害及於整個的中華民族、現在蘇省市會同組織這一個改進宣傳會雖然不敢說有如何成績、但這一幕戲是不能不做今日開會之始、即蒙各界踴躍參加、足見社會對於漁業、已有相當認識、希望此後民衆與政府共同來做這一幕提倡改進漁業的戲、</p>

<p>經過詳情</p>
<p>中華慈幼協會提倡兒童節告全國父老父老們、爲全國兒童的父母提倡兒童節、爲謀求全國兒童幸福的開源、慈幼協會會、茲劈頭的來担任中國兒童節的提倡者、不得不向你們爲全國兒童父母的父老們、有所奉告了、只是我們所欲奉告的不、是要使父老們驟然來認識兒童節、却要先請認識兒童的本身、也不是要父老們立刻來提倡兒童節、却要先請提高兒童的地位、惟如此、始能由認識兒童節、至於提倡兒童節、而我們對於這兩重觀點、要借下面幾點來解析、（一）有父母的兒童、不當再被視爲父母的私產、爲父母私產的兒童其父母以兒童爲我生我養、是我的血肉、我的東西非他人所爲力、非他人所有分、旣屬於我、我有全權操其生死、轉其悲喜、欲左欲右、欲長欲短隨我所爲、莫敢不從、如有違反、即指爲大逆不道、犬惡不孝、爲禽獸、爲蛇蠍、或公開送法、或私下出逐、這種事實和消息、猶能在此間的報紙上傳說上見到、聽到不知兒童爲社會國家的兒童、並非爲生養父母的私產、而生養父母的鞠育培植、亦爲對子女之義務、盡國家之責任、故前以兒女的造就爲光宗耀祖者今須改以兒女的造就、爲强國福民前以兒女爲繼父老承家業者、今須以兒女爲負社會職任的工員、担國家大事的領袖若能由前面那種錯誤的觀念、改至後面這個淸明的認識、實不僅認識兒童是已、亦即所以來認識兒童節了、（二）無父母的兒童、不當再被視爲社會的公瘤、爲社會公瘤的兒童、因無父或無母或父母全無的緣故棄於路側、流於草野若幸而被慈悲爲懐·㚥仁不讓的善男信女、瞥見了、或爲之收容、或爲之留養、居心雖然很好、但竟總以爲此種兒童、有之不多、去之不少、惟顧念其一條命、還是做點好事、救苦救難、爲子孫積些德吧、於是若輩兒童、遂被視爲社會的公瘤見之者呼之曰、「這個是孤兒、」「那個是苦兒」孤兒與苦兒、遂自成一特殊階級、爲民間所排擠、爲國家所不歡迎、類乎這種流行的觀念和措施、只需張目一看閉目一想、就可以淸爽如電影了、不知凡兒童本無分有父母或無父母、皆爲國家的兒童、社會的兒童、有父母者固須由父毋代國家負敎養之責任、而無父母者、其敎養之責任當然須歸於國家政府、或社會之公父母、斷不能因其無父母而被鄙爲社會的公瘤、國家的寄生蟲、若社會人士、以此輩無父母兒童的公父母爲己任、國家政府亦能如是、則此輩無父母兒童與有父母者有何異、其未來之造就、亦與有父母之兒童何異、如父老們能認識自己爲無父母、兒童的公父母那也可以進而認識兒童節了（、三）家庭與社會的福益、不當再長作成人的專利品我們張開眼一望、處處可以看出、現今家庭間的設備、社會上的布置都是爲了成人享受、很少有爲兒童打算的以平均計之、每四個人以上的家庭中、有一個兒童、所以兒童占社會人口的四分之一、且以家庭言、兒童在家庭的時間、較早出晚歸之成人爲長以社會言兒童業餘之閒暇、較成人工餘之閒暇爲多理應在家庭間爲兒童多設備玩物·圖書·以及用品等、使兒童得利用在家庭較長時間去自化、在社會裏也宜爲兒童多布置公園·游覻塲·圖書館·以及學校等使兒童得利用在社會較多的閒</p>

<p>肺結核之病原菌</p>
<p>自德國量聖考克博士宜佈發見結核菌爲肺結核之病原體以後。近來一般醫家。咸能將純粹培養之結核菌。移植於天竺鼠。可使該鼠發生同樣之結核症。　結核菌。可培養於含有甘油之肉汁凉菜及凝固血淸中。但其發育頗選。與其他各種之細菌　絶不同。按結核菌之形狀。恰似桿棒狀。不能自動。具體甚微。或直或灣。如集其千枚於一處。人目始能辨視。以一郵票之小面積。須以結核菌一千六百萬枚之多。始能平舖其上。至其繁殖之法。係本諸自身之分裂作用。由一化二。二化爲四。四再裂爲八。逐次倍加。故繁殖率極爲可驚。倘能任其繁殖於一適宜之處。則一晝夜中。一菌將叟爲數百萬之巨。該菌常叢聚於肺癆患者之唾涕中。據海爾雷博士發表。謂患癆病者之一塊痰中。含有三萬萬個以上之結核菌。苟患者如每小時咯痰一次。則一晝夜中當有七十二萬萬之結核菌。自該患者之肺内排出。而散播於空氣中。世人朝夕蒙其侵襲。然此患者並不因排出而減其量。因結核菌。　如上述之分裂繁殖。無休無歇。勢力漸大。今試假定其增殖之速力。爲每一小時營分裂作用一次。則二十四小時内。一個結核菌。頓化爲一千六百萬個以上。可不懼哉。</p>
<h3 id="c122">肺結核菌之抵抗力 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>肺結核菌之繁殖力可驚。已如上述。而其抵抗力之强大。尤爲可駭。如暴感癆病患者所咯之痰液於空氣中。則結核菌可生存達半年以上。設置於暗室内。則一年以上尚得保全其生存。但結核菌在人體或動物體之外。不能十分繁殖。且對於日光。頗乏抵抗力。如爲强烈之光線所直射。極易死滅。蓋該菌因温渡時間之關係。影響甚大。於五十度之熱度中。大抵經六小時。即死滅於六十度。一小時即死滅。九十度二分鐘即死滅。除温度以外。對於許多化學藥品。其抵抗力之頑强。竟出人章表。入於千分之二之毒藥昇汞水中。經二十四小時。尚不死滅。設加入百分之五之石炭酸水。攪拌一次。或於病痰中。加純酒精約痰之十倍量。則至二十四小時。始歸死滅云。</p>
<p>肺癆病係一種。難療治之慢性病。世人皆知。毋容贅述。蓋肺癆病菌。能由其自體。分泌一種抗酸的蠟質。包被其菌體。以作護身甲。故對於一般化學的藥品。最有抵抗性。加之剌激其附着繁殖之部分。而形成極强韌之結節。以致令一切殺菌藥品。不能達到其菌體。嗚呼自古東西醫家。研究肺結核菌撲滅劑之最大難關。實在此點。現今吾人所謂殺菌藥消毒劑者。皆係原形質毒。而可滅殺細菌者。亦可破壞身體之細胞及組織。故今日醫界。所渴望不巳之理想的治療結核劑。必須具下列諸項之先决條件。</p>
<p>（一）凡藥能侵入于結核病體内。可得直接作用於結核菌者。</p>
<p>（二）又能剝奪而溶解其結核菌之抗酸性蠟質膜ＬＩＰＯＩＤ者。</p>
<p>（三）能得完全殺滅結核菌。而不害毒於人體者。</p>

<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌。而此菌一入人體内。則於該處。便成結節。以斷血行之路。又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質。包圍其體。以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入。故雖　種種殺菌藥。内服或注射。終不能達其病菌之實體内。歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法。對症療法理學的療法。血淸療法。藥劑療法。及其他一切治療法等。尚未完全成功。而肺病無藥之說。遍滿於一世者。因未知此深奥學理故耳。由此現代結核學者。根據上述之學理。繼續研究。不遺餘力。結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑。名曰三那星Ｓanosin此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德或柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者。據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實騐報告。此藥有滲透肺病竈之結節及溶解蠟質之作用。兼具有殺菌力。能根治一二三期之肺癆。確有萬試萬靈之特效。在中國。業經國民政府中央衛生試驗所化驗。藥性和平無毒。絶無任何副作用。兹略舉醫治作用於下</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中。實驗（三那星）之藥力作用。則一分鐘後。結核菌皆消失其抗酸性。至三分鐘後。則此肺結核菌。完全殺盡。無一倖免。</p>
<p>（二）依動物試驗。則發見（三那星）能滲入結核病竈内。設檢查其病竈内潛伏之結核菌。則盡失其抗酸性。此尼證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣。</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服（三那星）星期左右。則立見咯痰稀釋。體熱下降等良好狀態。</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服（三那星）達三十天至六十天以上。則顯見體重增加。食懲激進。一切症狀。逐漸緩和。終達其回天再造之偉功。</p>

<p>旣遊梅園。客有繩蠡園之美者。予以十五日絶早往遊。園在揚名鄉。距錫城可十五六里。以車代步。屈折皆見桑麻。到門晨露未晞。輕陰菴柳。四圍斷亭古樹。風物蕭然。以微資易券得入。園佔太湖一角。長廊臨水。俯檻可掬湖波。壁間嵌米襄陽石刻。予循讀至忘遠近。越假山。則草地一弓。風帆三面。面湖築景宣樓。於此看湖上輕舸。出入畫闌風柳間。令人胸懷曠邈。久不能忘。鄰景宣樓者。爲湖上草堂。棐凡湘簾。位置楚楚。堂額爲裘昌年所書。筆意秀拔生動。雅稱斯堂。以草堂名者。在滬有半淞園之江上草堂。在蘇有澗上草堂。在無錫公園中。復有池上草堂。而佔地淸幽。烟波起伏。則以湖上爲最勝。西折。踰小桃源。石洞窈然。初以爲仙源雞犬。别有人家。而其地引水成池。小築亭館。轉覺一覽都盡。最妙者以水門汀砌一荷葉於水中央。其大略如圓桌。人行其下。乃眞有魚戱荷葉東。魚戲荷葉西之想矣。山石四圍。題曰「田田島」其名復何雅雋乃爾。裙屐旣多。吾乃引去。去蠡園數武。爲湖莊。割石裁雲。落成猶有待也。先是侣萍以足勌未往蠡園。相約遲我於惠泉山麓。洎予抵惠山。而萍殊未至。予乃獨過「隔紅塵」上「雲起樓」望寄暢園草碑斷柳。及山下鄉先生祠。爲悵立久之。斯遊也。江山雖好。莫遣繁憂。憶前歲之來。老母猶在。今獨上頭茅峯。攬白雲之蒼莽。念歸去何依。求嚮者牽衣倚閭之歡。不可復得。覺哀愁如海。五湖烟水。未足喻其深也。無何。四山將瞑。荒寺栖烟。侣萍旣來。相與烹茗於漪瀾堂下。試天下第二泉。比之橄欖回甘。芬留齒頰。在萍塵勞鞅掌。此來倘不虛乎</p>

<p>— 曼因</p>
<p>吾人每晨閱報。至本地社會新聞。觸於眼簾最多者。爲自殺新聞。此非獨繁盛之上海爲然。各地均有此種現象。自殺之原因。雖有種種。而多數爲經濟。少數則爲戀愛也。自殺之方法。自以仰藥者爲多。向者以吞生鴉片烟。希圖畢命。今則以服過量之安眠藥品者。亦不在少數。尤其知識界之靑年男女。彼等不知鴉片將於何處購之。若安眠藥品。則市上藥房林立。固隨處可以購得。又以吞生鴉片者。死狀頗慘。而服安眠藥品。則一夢昏騰。如入一别世界也。兹聞國民政府行政院。鑒於人民之以安眠藥品自殺者。日益衆多。擬籌取締之法。會有北平市民門景虞。亦請取締安眠藥品之儘量售賣。由北平市政府轉呈。聞將來取締之法。（一）各藥房非得有醫生簽名負責之藥方。不准出售安眠藥品。（二）市民購買安眠藥品時。應調查其姓名年齡及詳細地址。（三）每次購買時。不許出賣過一次服用之量。說者謂第一條實爲正當辦法。若第二條則蓄意自殺者。或可虛報其姓名住址。則亦令人無從查考。如今之在旅館自殺者。大半均爲假名也。至第三條實爲根本之計。然彼亦能積幾次服用之量而并吞之。則又何從防範。現已由内政部令衛生署。妥擬辦法。實行取締。此亦治標之策。總之人欲求死。則到處都成死路。即以上海而言。紫霞膏旣足摧生。黃浦江詎能加蓋。僅僅取締安眠藥品。亦非根本之計也。</p>

<p>二號。印度敎僧史德那道來。商亞洲文化協會事。云大學校長可加入。史偕余游英女皇維多利亞博物館。在公園對面。由佛會去。電車六銅子。入門則陳列左右爲石獅與牛之像。獅已壞其頭。牛乃四面頭。此印度風。常見者。有字記爲阿輸迦王所造也。Asoka　B·C·240-在西歷前二百四十年頃。佛敎之大護法也。館分上下樓兩層。礦石極多難識。珊瑚小樹不少。有大動物牙一對。長八十四英尺。有埃及之木乃尹。Mummmy即用藥料保存尸體。變成化石。至今不壞。乃四千年前物也。其衣紋尚存。而面部已成骨骼。今化學進步。不用此舊法矣。其中最耐尋味者。爲古碑古磚古佛像及印度敎各種造像。甚爲豐富。欲研究印度歷史文化及宗敎美術風俗者。必在此學習也。印度文字百餘種。非吾人能識。印度敎各種雕刻塑燒亦多種。其質有銅鐵石磚陶士各色。可易見者。其像多不穿衣。即佛像亦遍身不掛寸絲。又女像早有細腰。而雙乳甚大。與今西女式相同。可見今西俗出於印度也。</p>
<p>至此處搜集從各地方來者。有尼泊爾者不少。西藏佛像種類甚多。緬甸者。及本境各省者。斷頭缺足者不少。小可徑寸。大則長人。或坐或立。若有專門佛敎徒及能與印度比校研究其變遷之跡者。則必大有發明也。余曾見日本密宗各佛像者。又在仰光大學見英國所影印五架墩煌石室千佛圖。皆五采輝煌。中國所夢想不到。禮失求諸野。學估四夷。國粹亦落外人後。可爲大恥也。</p>
<p>館内有農業棉組綢磁各物。惟無機器。可見印人機器科學之不發達。印度各省大學林立。學生數千。其市面印人之英文著作。充滿書店。遠遇中國。惟不知學機器。所以不能與英人競與。</p>
<p>有緬王寳座一所。云爲最後之王國滅後。將其金殿之座移置此間也。頗華麗。</p>
<p>西樓東向大理石雕維多利亞女王像。成於一八七七年。乃用印人民名義紀念者。其立像左手持花圈。右手持短節。可一尺。丰神秀逸。爲并吞全印之女王。余問之印人。英圖印度始於十六世紀之東印度商會。漸至蠶食并吞全印。已及百年。各省分早晚吸收不等。有二百年者。有一百四十年者。直至今日。印人始大覺悟。反抗到底也。</p>

<p>— 霖</p>
<p>（四）這個自由</p>
<p>虹霓之後便是自由、這是二十世紀婦女們的呼聲、照歷史上講起來、婦女自立是件很新的事、如何不呌人驚異呢、從婦女們投了第一票到現在、雖然確期難憶、可是時日還不很久、二十年前、决聽不到一個年輕的姑娘、隻身到紐約去、找位置自己和命運奮鬭、現在每年却有成千的靑年女子到紐約去了、</p>
<p>這種自由有怎樣的意義、他所包含的又是些什麽呢、這意思是自己下着决心、結局如何、没有反訴的餘地、這意思是單獨的生活、或者和同時代的女子住在一起、可是她並不是舊校裏的女舍監、這意思是常常自己支撑自己、這意思是選讀有興味的東西、看戲劇高興的時候、一個人可以在午夜出外散步、總之這眞養是一個已婚女子的獨立、而没有重壓的責任、</p>
<p>有許多的父母、非常不願意他們的女兒單獨住在紐約城裏、父母們實在不明白、在目今的時世有一句不成文的格</p>
<p>言、呌做「靑年當令」舊例已經更改了、現在的年輕人、都要試試他們的翅膀、自尋生路、父母們反對這個說數的、站在失敗的地位、</p>
<p>紐約職業婦女不和家屬住在一起的、具有完全的自由第一、她們的職業决不致與她們的社交生活混擾在一起、在小城市裏、同事們對於各個人的私人行動、十分明瞭、在紐約城裏、因爲地大人衆、職業女子一離辦公室、就可以影蹤不見、她所做的都是她個人的事情、直到第二天早晨上工時爲止、</p>
<p>在紐約城裏居住、鄰居大都不通音問、所以有些人在合組屋裏住上幾個年頭、與别的住客漠不相識社交的束縛解放無遺、職業婦女不必顧慮到鄰人們的偵視、伊可以想和做照着自已所歡喜這樣對於眞有力量的女子、實在是一種光榮、個人篤實自信的行爲、不必爲陳腐相傳的動作所干格、女子們没有極有價値的性格幸、福方面要差一點、她們辨别不出眞的價値、有時候還要爲美慾所欺惑、受到痛苦、父母們扶養女兒長大、爲他們着想、知道在何論那種情况之下、他們能發現勝利、（未完）</p>

<p>— 蘇君</p>
<p>爲了神經衰弱得太苦、聽朋友們的勸說來到西湖居住、差不多又一個星期了、不慣孤寂與沈默的我、躱在湖濱的一位革命烈士的墓塲旁邊的小屋裏、凄寞占據著我的周遭、除了去看過兩次醫生、和在傍晚到蘇堤上散散步外、我生活在如此大靜的空間、老實說、我的神經一直地是在苦着、因爲、孤獨的呌喊那是一種自殺啊、</p>
<p>傍晚、去發寫給朋友們的信、順便去散步、在路上、忽然想起六叔的叮囑、要給他帶一串檀香珠去、於是進了岳王廟、在廟門口有很多賣檀香珠和其他物品的、但我走到裏面去、在那大樹下、我去向一個賣檀香珠的攤上揀選、</p>
<p>這個賣檀香珠者、是個姑娘、在她的頰與她的胸、她的腰圍的隠約的輪廓、以至牠的圓潤的手與纖巧的脚的姿態、他是一個成熟的少女、而且、她有相當姿色、但那是素朴的、而又帶有少許　惑性的底、這流露在她的一笑中、與她說話的聲音裏、</p>
<p>「這些香、」她說着、並遞給我許多串的集合、但她的小而靈巧的眼睛望着空間、－她没有去看任何對象、</p>
<p>「哦、」我嗅着、我的鼻尖近着她的手、她將手縮回去、我說、「是的、然而那還没有你的手香啊、」</p>
<p>她震驚於這個買客的調戲、轉過臉她笑了、我也笑了、</p>
<p>我取了一串、我問她道、</p>
<p>「要賣多少錢呢、」</p>
<p>「六角、」</p>
<p>「六角、」我抬起我的眉毛、並撫摸着檀香珠、我於是向她講着價錢、「應該賤點啊、」</p>
<p>「你說呢、」她讓價於買客了、</p>
<p>「四角吧、」我說「但我担心呵、只怕這珠子會變得不香了呢、」</p>
<p>「不會的呀、」她說、「你放在袋裏、你套在手臂上、你輕輕地摸撫着、不會不香的、」</p>
<p>「會的、」我裝得固執地說、「這些珠子被我買來、牠一定會不香了的、」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢、」</p>
<p>「是的、」我說、而且嘆息着、「牠們在你那裏、你會將你撲臉的香粉撒在上面呀、或者隨時牠們都可以被沾染到你的手上的香、和從你臉上滴落下的混了香粉的汗液的呀、然而、牠們將會不幸了因爲被我買來、…………」</p>
<p>「哦、」她笑着、「這樣會說笑話啊」、</p>
<p>「不是笑話呀、」我說、「我還是不買牠去吧、買了牠、如果眞的不來是呢、這我一定要抛棄了牠、呵、牠不是太不幸了嗎、」</p>
<p>……」她笑、她因我的太多說話而不能了解了、的確、在我後來的說話並不是調戲、而是眞的意識着底感傷了、</p>
<p>「四角錢就賣給你吧、」她說、「牠還會不香的、只要你不給牠吹風打雨、你好好地玩着牠、牠是長久地香着的、」</p>
<p>「哦、」我笑着說、「像你的手一樣長久的嫩着、你的微笑一樣長久地存留着</p>
<p>的牠也是長久地香着的、</p>
<p>「是的、」她說、「只要你好好地玩着　、」</p>
<p>她忽然轉過頭去、沈默地位曁空間手撫着檀香珠、</p>
<p>我留下四角錢在攤上、在檀香珠的上面、我撫着一串檀香、珠悄悄走去了、</p>
<p>我的心裏溜出一聲滑稽的嘆息、</p>

<p>— 詹碧</p>
<p>民國二十年、又是有了幾十天了、本市的許多學校、都在忙着開學、兩個妹妹、她們也忙着要搬進學校裏面去、</p>
<p>她們兩個人是住的前樓、我一個人是住的亭子間、我今晨起來在前樓去洗臉、英妹貞妹、都在討論退房子的事情、我說這個前樓退了就完、了有個什麽討論呢、英妹微笑地說着、</p>
<p>「你懂上海的規矩嗎、」</p>
<p>「我怎麽不懂、」</p>
<p>「他是老上海、當然會懂得的、」</p>
<p>貞妹說了又冷笑着、英妹又接着說、</p>
<p>「現在正是廢曆十二月房東是個封建頭腦的人、他是要過陰曆年、年關的上下二月、臘月和正月、他是不能允許我們退房子的、你要去退、我看怎麽退得了、所以我同姐姐商議商議呢、」</p>
<p>「喲、退不了、怎的退不了麽、你看、我去退了吧、要使我們男子、終歸是退得了的、在你們女子、怕不大成功吧、」</p>
<p>貞妹只是笑、英妹他怒着說、</p>
<p>「我看你去退、你退得了、就算你們男子有見識些、退不了的時候、你今天晚上回來晚了、我硬是不得與你關門、要你在那露天壩站一夜、以罰你嘴巴打人的罪惡、」</p>
<p>「好好好、」嗟嗟地我笑着走下樓去找房主人了、</p>
<p>房主人本來是很多、他們一家人有十多個、然而主事的、是一個老太太、五十多歲的一個老太太、這個老太太、很和靄的、很仁慈的、面孔上、常現着可親近可愛慕的一種微笑、我們此次來上海在這兒住了四個月、她差不多、没有一天、不同我們三姊妹談談天的、我們底起居衣食、一切日常生活、她總是常常要問問、很關心、一天英妹的衣服穿得薄一些、她把她身摸摸、肩上揑揑很躭心地說道、</p>
<p>「唉呀妹妹喲、你快去多穿點衣裳呢、天氣冷得很喲、冷得不好了、害着病、眞是討論咧、」</p>
<p>又有一天、她看見貞妹没有起床、她就坐在床沿上、用手去把貞妹的頭摸摸、她很着急的說、</p>
<p>「喔呀、額上湯得利害呀、詹先生、快去請一個太醫來診診脈、要快吃藥才好喲、」</p>
<p>「哥哥没有在家裏了、今天早晨到吳淞去了、」</p>
<p>英妹回覆她說她馬上就離開床沿、一面走、一面說、</p>
<p>「我去帮你請個醫生、衙道門口斜對住那個醫生、是個女醫生、很不錯的、我去帮你請來、」</p>
<p>她對我們的愛護眞是有如慈母一樣地、剛才妹妹她們說是討論退房子的問題、大槪是爲了這位老太的愛護和靄的情感的關係、而生出討論的事實來的吧、</p>
<p>我一走進她的房門口、她就看見我了、</p>
<p>「詹先生你起來得很早咧、」</p>
<p>「不早了有九點鐘了、我眞是愛睡晏覺、」</p>
<p>「早、很早、天冷咧、有許多人、上海是有許多人十二點鐘纔起床的、」</p>
<p>「老太太、我們要退房子、前樓不住了、」</p>
<p>喲、退房子、好、好、你們搬在什麽地方去呢、怎麽又只退前樓、」</p>
<p>「我底妹妹她們要去讀書了、明後天、就要搬進學校中去、我還是住在此地、」</p>
<p>「進學堂讀書、好咧、」</p>
<p>「眞對不起你、臘月中、本是不該向你退房子的、」</p>
<p>「喲呀、詹先生、你快不要那樣講、兩個姑娘、她們進學校裏要讀書呵、臘月中退房子、也是不要緊的、反正、我們自己也缺少房子住、你看、我底孫孫、他剛從北方來、他現在没有房子安床舖、你看、就睡在棹子上面的、」</p>

<p>In world affairs, destruction is easy, but success is difficult. Every major problem arises after the efforts of many people, running around in many directions, and after countless twists and turns before there is hope for preliminary success. But this hope for preliminary success is not yet reliable. If there are difficulties in progress, the previous achievements can be abandoned. There are many such examples. The naval agreement between France and Italy, which was mediated by the British Foreign Secretary, was said to be the first step in implementing arms reduction, and there was hope for success. However, according to today's telegram from Paris, a serious situation has been found in the Franco-Italian maritime agreement. The most difficult point is that the experts from the three countries have different interpretations of the article that adds the tonnage of new French and Italian battleships to the fleet. After the French Foreign Minister met with the Italian and British ambassadors, the political circles were deeply concerned that the negotiations would be stalled. According to a telegram from London, the experts who drafted the Franco-Italian maritime agreement have now returned to their countries for the Easter holidays. The major difficulties encountered at present have not yet been resolved. The main points are: First, France requires a clear stipulation that this agreement and the concessions made by France are temporary in nature and cannot be used as precedents in the future. Second, Japan insists that the provisions of Chapter 1 regarding battleships and aircraft carriers cannot be interpreted as changing the Washington Conference Treaty and the London Treaty. The United States also has the same intention. Based on these two telegrams, whether the Franco-Italian agreement will succeed is still uncertain. The French and Italian newspapers that were happily optimistic about the success of the agreement before are now making pessimistic remarks. Is this not a proof of the difficulty of success in world affairs?</p>
<p>By extension, the European tariff truce agreement, which has been in operation for several years and is nearing success, has now been completely cancelled due to the non-approval of one or two countries. The European Federation plan of Briand has also encountered difficulties in progress due to the German-Austrian tariff agreement. The German-Austrian agreement is also very difficult to implement due to the opposition of other countries. Is this not another proof of the previous statement?</p>

<p>Drinking Unfiltered Water Will Result in Execution</p>
<p>Epidemic Already Emerging</p>
<p>National News Agency, Managua, 3rd: Martial law has been declared here. Not only will looters be immediately executed on the spot, but drinking unfiltered water is also punishable by death. Several people have already been executed for drinking unfiltered water. Burial and cremation work continues unabated. All survivors of the disaster, except for the rescue team, have been moved to villages with clean water. The local authorities are setting up food distribution centers and temporary hospitals in the area. The fire here has been extinguished, but there is still a risk of rekindling in the event of strong winds. The US Marines, together with rescue workers, are still searching for corpses in the rubble, extinguishing remaining fires, guarding the remaining property of the people, caring for the victims, and maintaining local order. Most of the American women and children have flown to Colón. The US transport ship Gammonde is anchored there, waiting to carry American expatriates back to San Francisco. In addition, some are flying to Panama and then returning to their home country. Many expatriates from other countries are also flying to Colón, making the city very crowded. US Army and Marine Corps aircraft and Pan American Airlines aircraft are still flying between here and Colón, and will stop only after all US and foreign expatriates have left the country. The US aircraft Lomendes, carrying medicine, clothing, and food, arrived in Colón today, and its crew will come here to join the relief effort. The residents who remain here, except for occasional looting, are generally able to maintain order, but they are suffering greatly from the lack of drinking water and food. An epidemic has broken out, but rescue teams are arriving one after another and will soon be able to put it out.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Managua, 3rd: According to investigations, only one Chinese expatriate suffered a minor head injury in the earthquake. There have been no reports of deaths.

<h3 id="e61">Future of the Anglo-Franco-Italian Naval Treaty <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Differing Interpretations Among Experts</p>
<p>Naval Negotiations May Stall</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 4th: The pessimistic news about the future of the Anglo-Franco-Italian naval treaty, which was published a few days ago, has now been fully confirmed in the comments of various newspapers in Paris. The French press admits that the situation is very serious. The most difficult point is the interpretation of the clause that France and Italy can add 136,000 tons and 129,000 tons of new capital ships to their fleets by 1936, respectively. Experts from France, Britain, and Italy have different interpretations. France insists that it takes three years to build these giant ships, and the ships within the tonnage allowed by that clause must be completed by 1936. France is also free to build other warships, which can be added to the fleet after 1936. However, experts from Italy and Britain argue that the treaty binds both parties in terms of both the construction and building of warships until 1936. If the French experts' interpretation is followed, the effect of this treaty will actually end in 1933. Therefore, the two sides have been deadlocked and it is difficult to mediate. French Foreign Minister Briand met with the Italian ambassador yesterday, and today he discussed with the British ambassador for a long time. The French political circles are deeply concerned that naval negotiations will stall.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Hamaguchi Re-enters Hospital <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Will Be Hospitalized for Two Weeks</p>
<p>Coup May Be Hard to Avoid</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 4th: Prime Minister Hamaguchi has decided to re-enter the hospital for surgery. On the morning of the 5th, Dr. Shiotada will use local anesthesia, which will take about five minutes. Then, the leaders of the government and the party, such as Minister of Railways Eguchi, Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara, Chief Secretary Suzuki, and Secretary-General Sakurada, met with Dr. Shiotada at the Prime Minister's official residence at 1 PM to discuss the results and decided that the hospitalization period would be only two weeks. At this time, no temporary acting prime minister will be appointed.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 4th: Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who is ill, had a sudden change in his condition this morning. He called Minister of Railways Eguchi and Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara to the official residence by telephone and was inquiring about the whereabouts of Interior Minister Adachi. Relatives of the Prime Minister also received phone calls and went to the official residence. The official residence is now very crowded. Soon, the three attending physicians, Shiotada, Manabe, and Mizobuchi, also rushed to the scene after receiving an urgent report. After consultation, the four doctors announced at 1:20 PM that Prime Minister Hamaguchi must be re-hospitalized for about two weeks.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 4th: After Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition changed suddenly, he immediately summoned his son-in-law, Iwao Aida, and his wife, as well as Masamoto Kitada and his wife, to the official residence by telephone. Inada, a doctor of internal medicine, also came to the residence to treat him at 10:30 this morning. Because the condition report has not yet been released, the change seems quite worrying.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 4th: The government pretends to be calm on the surface regarding Prime Minister Hamaguchi's re-hospitalization, but it is very embarrassed inside. The leaders of the government and the party all expect a coup to be imminent, so they gathered at the Prime Minister's official residence to discuss future countermeasures. Whether the cabinet will resign en masse depends on the Prime Minister's decision. However, various aspects of the political and business circles, as well as the elder statesmen, are paying attention to the Prime Minister's responsibility to assist. The Prime Minister may take this opportunity to make a final decision. All attention is focused on this point.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 4th: Prime Minister Hamaguchi's re-hospitalization caused considerable shock to the party. The cadres still trust the words of the attending physicians and decided not to act rashly, but to wait for the Prime Minister's recovery and observe the changes. They are quite worried about the occurrence of a major situation, which may lead to turmoil within the party. The cadres are now working hard to end the turmoil within the party.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 4th: Prime Minister Hamaguchi, accompanied by Secretary Nakajima and Mrs. Natsuko, re-entered Shiotada Surgery at Tokyo Imperial University Hospital by car at 4 PM today. Dr. Shiotada will perform the surgery again tomorrow. Given his current state of weakness, it is doubtful whether he will be able to recover quickly after the surgery. Even if it goes smoothly, he will not be able to perform government affairs for the time being. The general opinion is that a coup will be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 4th: The government did not hold an emergency cabinet meeting on Prime Minister Hamaguchi's re-hospitalization. It will hold a regular cabinet meeting on the 7th to make important decisions on the operation of government affairs during the Prime Minister's hospitalization.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 4th: Prime Minister Hamaguchi left the Prime Minister's residence at 8:20 PM and went to Tokyo Imperial University Hospital, deciding to be hospitalized for two weeks for surgery.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 4th: Several representatives of the Seiyukai Party, who will question the government about the shortfall in revenue for the Showa 5th fiscal year, requested to meet with Prime Minister Hamaguchi and Finance Minister Inoue today. Finance Minister Inoue replied that because Prime Minister Hamaguchi is ill, the Finance Minister will represent the government and meet at the Prime Minister's residence on the 5th.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 4th: Prime Minister Hamaguchi arrived safely at the hospital at 9:10 PM. The surgery will be performed tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but it has not yet been decided.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Rome, 3rd: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently spoke in Milan, referring to the German-Austrian customs union. The newspapers here paid close attention to it. One part of Mussolini's speech mainly stated that the economic situation in Italy and the world has undergone positive changes in the past three months. The important reasons are: first, the temporary agreement on the naval issue; second, the new agreement between Britain and India; and third, the German-Austrian customs union. Commentators believe that at a time when the world is criticizing the German-Austrian customs union, the Italian Prime Minister is able to make a fair evaluation, which has aroused great attention from all circles. It is also heard that Italian jurists and diplomats are currently reviewing the customs union, so the Italian government has not been able to clearly state its position.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 3rd: It is heard that as soon as the Secretariat of the League of Nations receives the British proposal to include the German-Austrian customs union in the agenda of the Council, it will invite Austria to participate in the Council. However, the British side is still investigating the customs union and has not yet completed the matter, so the proposal has not been sent out.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 3rd: The two factions of the National Socialist Party are now attacking each other, verbally and in writing. Hitler has issued an order to remove the leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA), Stenne, and his associates, as well as the leaders of the Sturmabteilung in Stettin, Rostock, Landberg, and Silesia, from the party. Stenne declared that Hitler had violated the party program and had lost his leadership of the Berlin headquarters, and nominated Huehol to replace Hitler. He recently declared that all of the Northern National Socialist Party is willing to support Stenne, while the Hitler party is strongly opposed to this statement. The headquarters of the Berlin National Socialist Party is now under the strict guard of the secessionists, and members of the Hitler party are unable to enter. Pedestrians in the street are standing and watching, and the police are working hard to maintain order. Fortunately, there has been no disturbance.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 4th: The separatist members of the National Socialist Party withdrew from the Berlin Party headquarters and newspaper last night. Today, the newspaper is again the organ of Party Leader Hitler, carrying Hitler's declaration, saying that he will soon eliminate the traitors within the party. According to reports, the failure of this split movement in the party was so rapid due to the lack of financial backing.</p>

It is heard that the members also felt that China's anti-Japanese sentiment is very deep, while they are very friendly to Britain.</p>

<p>Soviet Russia Protests for the Second Time</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 3rd: In the case of the assassination of the Soviet Trade Counselor in Japan on March 16, the Soviet Union protested to the Japanese government, but has not yet received a reply. The Soviet Foreign Ministry today sent a note to the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, requesting that the Japanese government's proposed measures to prevent anti-Russian behavior be replied to as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: Soviet Russia issued a second strong protest against the murder of the Soviet Trade Counselor in Tokyo, pointing to the anti-Russian movement in Japan due to fisheries and ruble issues, and demanded thorough investigation measures. Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara will reply to this in a few days, denying the existence of an anti-Russian movement. The Japanese government regards the Soviet protest as a move to appease the public, so it does not attach importance to it. From the perspective of various evidence, the assassin was a person who was disappointed in obtaining concession rights and acted purely out of personal motives. It has nothing to do with any organization and has no political significance.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Anti-Opium Commission Strictly Prohibits Illegal Handling of Opium Cases <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Notifying All Provinces and Cities to Comply</p>
<p>The Central Anti-Opium Commission believes that opium cases discovered in various places should be handled by judicial organs in accordance with the provisions of the Anti-Opium Implementation Rules, and no other organs may accept them. The Executive Yuan had previously issued an order to comply with this. However, recent investigation reports have repeatedly stated that some local authorities still do not handle opium cases in accordance with the aforementioned regulations. This is not in accordance with legal regulations and is prone to malpractices. Yesterday, based on the previous order of the Executive Yuan, it specifically notified all ministries and provincial and municipal governments to strictly prohibit the illegal handling of opium cases in order to purify the anti-opium policy and avoid malpractices.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Case of Japanese Soldiers Shooting a Chinese Person in Hankou <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Sent a Letter to the Japanese Consulate for Negotiation</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Japanese navy sailors stationed in Hankou often cause misunderstandings due to landing exercises. Recently, an incident occurred involving the shooting and injuring of a Chinese person. On the 3rd, the Hankou Municipal Government sent a letter to the Japanese consulate, initiating serious negotiations. The incident occurred on the afternoon of the 1st at 1:00 PM when Japanese naval personnel were practicing target shooting in the Zhaojiatiao area under the jurisdiction of the 13th Police Precinct. A farmer named Ni Zhaomei was plowing his field in Simeitang, more than a thousand meters away from the shooting range. Unexpectedly, a bullet flew over and struck Ni in the waist, exiting through his left abdomen. The group leader of the 28th group of the Hankou Municipal Farmers' Association, Li Zhonghui, reported the incident to the preparatory committee of the 1st district, requesting that the 13th Precinct send personnel to investigate and provide assistance. Subsequently, farmers from the district carried Ni to the 13th Precinct. The precinct chief, Wan Dixiu, after consulting with the Japanese naval translator Hashimoto, had him sign a document and sent Ni to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He also reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, which forwarded it to the Municipal Government. Simultaneously, the 1st District Farmers' Association also reported through the Social Affairs Bureau, which forwarded it to the Municipal Government. Mayor Liu Wendao then sent a letter to the Japanese Consul stationed in Hankou on the 3rd, initiating serious negotiations. The original letter reads as follows: "According to a report from the Social Affairs Bureau, based on a report from Tian Zhongyu, the chief executive of the 1st District Farmers' Association, and others, Li Zhonghui, the group leader of the 28th group of the association, reported that on April 1st at 2:00 PM, a member of the association, Ni Zhaomei, was plowing his field in Zhaojiatiao when he was suddenly injured by a bullet fired by a Japanese person. The bullet struck him directly in the waist, entering from the back and exiting from the front, causing profuse bleeding and rendering him unconscious. Fortunately, the 13th Police Precinct learned of the incident and immediately apprehended the Japanese perpetrator while sending member Ni to Tongren Hospital for treatment. To date, his condition remains unknown. We respectfully request that your association send personnel to negotiate this matter, emphasizing the importance of human life. According to this, we have dispatched personnel to investigate the reported details, and they are all found to be true. Carrying weapons in the interior has long been prohibited by our government and strictly forbidden to all foreigners. This Japanese person dared to carry weapons arbitrarily at a time when the communist bandits have not been eliminated, deliberately shooting and killing our compatriot, treating human life as a trivial matter, and disregarding our national sovereignty. Furthermore, the member's family is extremely impoverished, with eight members crying out for food. The suffering caused by this tragedy is unimaginable. Based on the foregoing, we hereby submit this document for your review, urgently requesting that your office send personnel to</p>
<p>the relevant consulate to conduct serious negotiations, punish the perpetrators, and provide relief to the victim and his family. This would be a virtuous and convenient action. Based on this, in addition to sending personnel to investigate the incident site, we submit a report to your government, urgently requesting that you send personnel to negotiate with the Japanese consulate in order to emphasize the importance of the lives of our citizens. Based on this, we noted that your city's Zhongshan and other newspapers reported an incident of Japanese soldiers shooting and injuring a Chinese person during target practice. Considering that this matter concerns human life, we have already ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and report the details. Based on the foregoing, in addition to issuing an order to promptly report the findings of the investigation for verification, we also ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and report in accordance with previous and current orders, and to inform the Special Commissioners of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Anhui, and Jiangxi. Accordingly, we hereby send this letter to you, requesting that you investigate the circumstances of this case and provide a response." (April 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Xu Yuanquan Arrives in Hankou <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the suppression of bandits began in Hubei province several months ago, although large groups of Red Bandits have been defeated, scattered small groups still need to be eliminated. He Chengjun, the head of the Wuhan Headquarters, previously received an order from the General Headquarters, ordering all armies to completely eliminate the Red Bandits before the opening of the National Assembly. He has already sent telegrams to various units, instructing all senior officers to take responsibility for this matter. The remaining bandits in eastern Hubei have already fled far into western Hubei, and the remaining bandits in western Hubei have also fled to the border of Hunan. Northern and southern Hubei have been completely wiped out. It is estimated that by May 5th, the Red Bandits will be completely eliminated. However, in areas bordering other provinces, such as Xiaogan Huayuan Huangpi Guanghua bordering Henan, Huangmei Guangji Qichun bordering Anhui, Jianli Shishou Mianyang bordering Hunan, and Jingyi bordering Sichuan, it is inevitable that they will flee back and forth between these areas. Xu Yuanquan, the Clearing-Up Director of the Sichuan-Hunan-Hubei Border Area, and Li Mingzhong, the Pacification Director of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei Border Area, have been separately charged with the responsibility of suppressing the bandits. Xu reported on the progress of the clearing-up efforts and departed from Shashi on the 2nd to come to Hankou. He passed through Jianli that evening and is expected to arrive in Hankou on the morning of the 4th. Zhang Zhenhan, the brigade commander of his unit, who has been instrumental in bandit suppression, arrived a day earlier. On the 3rd, he was summoned to Beijing by a telegram from the General Headquarters. It is rumored that there are plans to expand his unit into a division. It is said that after Xu arrives in Hankou, he will discuss joint defense measures between Hunan and Hubei with Zhang Ying, who has also come to Hankou, so that the Red Bandits will have nowhere to escape. Li plans to move the Pacification Headquarters of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei Border Area to Huangchuan within the next few days, and he will personally serve as the commander-in-chief of the pursuit and suppression efforts, personally overseeing the suppression. Recently, the banditry situation in various areas is still more severe in the Henan-Anhui-Hubei border region, so the military force in that area is also stronger. (April 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Hunan Province Captures Red Bandit Division Commander <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Liu Hongling, the commander of the Red Bandit Independent 3rd Division, who has been harassing the Chaling Youxian area in eastern Hunan and the Lianhua area in western Jiangxi, is subordinate to Zhu De. At the beginning of last month, Liu's bandits colluded with Li Mingrui's troops to capture Lingxian County. Subsequently, He Jian dispatched the two brigades of Duan Heng and Zhong Guangren to recapture Lingxian County. Li's troops fled back to Suichuan, Jiangxi, and Liu led his troops back to the Liuwan bandit lair in Chaling. On the 25th of last month, Zhang Kongyi, the commander of the 2nd Regiment of Zhong's Brigade, led his troops to suppress the Red Bandits in the Liuwan area. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the bandit lair was finally broken on the 27th, killing more than 300 bandits and capturing 26 alive. During the interrogation, it was discovered that Liu was also among those captured. He was immediately escorted to the brigade headquarters in Chaling. After Brigade Commander Zhong confirmed his identity, the other 25 bandits were executed on the spot on the 29th. However, because Liu was an important bandit leader in eastern Hunan, he was considered important. The next day, a company of soldiers was dispatched to escort him to the 31st Division headquarters. After Division Commander Tao personally interrogated him once, Liu only pleaded for a quick death and refused to reveal any information about the Red Bandit plans. Yesterday, he was escorted to the provincial capital and detained in the Clearing-Up Headquarters. It is said that a detailed confession will be extracted before he is executed. The original report from Division Commander Tao is recorded below: "According to the report from Zhong Guangren, the brigade commander of my department's 1st Brigade, during the fierce battle between my brigade's 2nd Regiment and the Red Bandits in Yaoshui Liuwan, Chaling, the officers and soldiers fought bravely and captured Liu Hongling, the commander of the Bandit Independent 3rd Division and the commander-in-chief of the Chaling Eastern Red Guards. The 25 captured bandits have been executed on the spot, as reported in the telegram. It is found that the bandit is extremely guilty. The tragedy of the Chaling Red Disaster is actually the order of the bandit. The people of Chaling and various public law groups have requested that the head be beheaded in Chaling City to show the public and enforce the law and to please the people. I think that the position of the bandit is extremely important, how can it be dealt with hastily? In Chaling, he only met with County Chief Zeng to make a verbal interrogation, without using any criminal canon, so the confession has not yet been revealed. If he is not severely interrogated, he cannot know the bandit organization's strength and the poisonous plan to collude with the Jiangxi bandits. Special Officer Wang Su, the company commander of the special service company of my department, is specially sent to escort him to the office. I respectfully request that you conduct a strict interrogation to clarify all the plans of the Red Bandits, in order to facilitate the cleanup. Moreover, the officers and soldiers of the regiment fought bravely to capture the bandit leader, and according to the Bandit Suppression Regulations, there are heavy rewards for cases. I respectfully ask that you give generous rewards to encourage meritorious service and boost morale, and beg that after the bandit is executed, his head will be sent to Chaling for public display to please the people and chill the bandit's courage. According to the report, the criminal Liu Hongling confessed that he was the commander of the Red Bandits. It is confirmed that the regiment was brave in suppressing the bandits and should be rewarded to boost morale and encourage meritorious service. Your seat will be judged by rewarding and punishing. The circumstances of the offer of prisoners and request for rewards are hereby submitted together with the documents. It is requested that the instructions be followed on how to dispose of and reward them." (April 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e84">The Negotiation Process Between Kailuan and Beining <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Kailuan Refuses to Revise Coal Transportation Agreement</p>
<p>Beining Has Cancelled Extreme Resistance Methods</p>
<p>Various Circles in Tianjin Advocate for the Recovery of the Kaiping Company</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Kailuan Mining Company produces approximately 5 million tons of coal annually, accounting for 20% of the national coal production. Its sales scope is not only sufficient to monopolize the market in North China, but the coal used in Shanghai, Guangdong, and the Yangtze River area also relies heavily on its supply. Therefore, its annual profit has reached approximately 10 million yuan. The dividend for every hundred taels of stock has reached over 90 yuan. Among various enterprises in China, the profit of this mine is the highest. However, although the mine is nominally a Sino-foreign joint venture, most of the power is controlled by foreigners, resulting in a significant outflow of benefits. Recently, the Beining Railway Bureau proposed to the company to revise the coal transportation agreement, but the company refused. The railway then cancelled extreme resistance measures, unwilling to transport more than the amount stipulated in the agreement. As a result, the company's products could not be exported. The company then published advertisements in newspapers in the north and south, limiting the quantity of coal sold, which aroused social attention and concern about a possible coal shortage. The following is a record of the process of this incident. The issue that triggered the negotiation was that the prices of coal sold by the mine to the Jinpu and Beining railways were different. The price of coal used by the Jinpu Railway was 25 cents lower per ton of slack coal and 30 cents lower per ton of lump coal than that sold to the Beining Railway. The amount of the price difference was called a commission, which was a kind of secret expense for Beining, but a benefit for the successive handlers of the Jinpu Railway. This has been implemented since 1924. It was not until last year, during the tenure of Liu Encheng, the director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau appointed by Yan Xishan, that this commission was included in the public accounts. Therefore, the price of coal currently used by the Jinpu Railway is lower than that of the Beining Railway due to the public accounting of the commission. This matter was recently discovered by the Beining Railway Bureau. The railway bureau believed that it had never heard of Kailuan privately taking commissions and that it had always been fully responsible for transporting coal for the mine. Why was the price of coal it used actually higher than that of the Jinpu Railway? Therefore, it sent personnel to negotiate with Kailuan, requesting that it follow the Jinpu Railway's method and return all the commissions that the Beining Railway should have received but did not receive from the time the Jinpu Railway began to receive commissions in 1924 until now. The total amount of this money is approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, which should be returned to the railway bureau and included in the public accounts. From now on, the price of coal should be handled in accordance with the price offered by Jinpu. Yang Jiali, the American general manager of the mine, replied that the reason for paying commissions to the Jinpu Railway was to avoid the bureau owing coal payments, so the commission was used to reward the handlers to avoid owing coal payments. This was not a reduction in the price of coal and had already passed, so the Beining Railway should not use it as an example. As for recovering the previous amount, it could not be done. The Beining Railway Bureau believed that the mine's actions were a violation of the usual practice of merchants. Furthermore, the coal transportation agreement signed between the mine and the Beining Railway Bureau would expire in June of this year and should be revised. Therefore, it cancelled extreme resistance measures, only transporting 3,000 to 5,000 tons per day, which prevented the mine from exporting a large amount of coal. Later, Yang Jiali asked someone to mediate and personally went to Beijing and Shanghai to lobby, but to no avail. He then planned to go to Shenyang on the 1st of this month to ask the Northeast authorities to find a way to mediate. However, Gao Jiyi had already reported this incident to Deputy Commander Zhang. It is said that Zhang also advocated for active negotiations, ordering the Beining Railway to persist to the end. After this incident occurred, the citizens of Tianjin, citing the inconvenience of transportation and the high price of coal, became greatly resentful. Mining experts and the municipal party department have launched a movement to recover the mine. Because Kailuan was formed by the merger of the Chinese-operated Zhou Company and the foreign-operated Kaiping Company, it was stipulated at the time of the merger in the early years of the Republic that after ten years, the Zhou Company could prepare the price to purchase the Kaiping Company. Now, ten years have passed, and the Zhou shareholders have no intention of purchasing the Kaiping Company, and they are sitting idly by as the benefits flow overseas. Therefore, it is planned to request the government to order the Zhou Company to prepare the price as soon as possible to recover the foreign rights of the Kaiping Company. At the same time, the Jingxing, Zhengfeng, and Tongcheng coal mining companies, which are operated by Chinese, have long been under the pressure of Kailuan, and their operations are mostly depressed. Now, they plan to take this opportunity to promote their products. The Beining Railway Bureau has agreed to allocate as many vehicles as possible for transportation, in order to avoid Kailuan hoarding and raising prices.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Details of the Mukden Japanese Army's Looting of Arms <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Looted Weapons Have Now Been Returned</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: In the case of the Japanese garrison surrounding our police station and looting weapons, the Japanese side has now returned the looted weapons after serious negotiations by the authorities. It started on the afternoon of the 29th at around 9:00 PM, when over a hundred Japanese garrison soldiers suddenly surrounded the Public Security Bureau of Dama Road in the Commercial District, setting up checkpoints as if facing a formidable enemy. Upon hearing the news, the First Branch of the Commercial District immediately dispatched translator Zhang Zhongzhen to negotiate. Unexpectedly, the Japanese garrison did not allow him to speak and even tied up Zhang with ropes, threatening him with guns. The First Branch believed that this matter was of great importance, so it sent bureau members Yao and Wen to negotiate again, and reported it to their superiors. Huang Xiansheng, the chief of the police department, immediately sent Chief Inspector Tai and others to the First Branch of the Commercial District to jointly negotiate with the Japanese side. At the same time, he immediately went to the governor's office to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang to request instructions. Deputy Commander Zhang immediately summoned Chairman Zang to the office. After discussion, he ordered the Negotiation Department to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese Consulate. It was not until late at night that the Japanese army withdrew and returned to their barracks. At the same time, the Shili Matou Branch was also surrounded, and all thirteen large and small firearms were looted. After the Japanese garrison withdrew, the Negotiation Department immediately sent personnel to continue negotiations and return the looted firearms. Yesterday (the 30th), at around 4:00 PM, the First Branch of the Commercial District received a phone call from the branch office, stating that the Japanese side had agreed to return the looted firearms and requested that personnel be sent to the office to receive them. The First Branch immediately dispatched Bureau Member Guan and Chief Wang to the branch office. At around 5:00 PM, the Japanese side sent personnel to the office with the firearms. After going through the handover procedures, the reception was completed at 6:15 PM. The document from Huang Xiansheng, the chief of the police department, reporting to the provincial government is recorded below: "According to the report from the First Branch of the Commercial District, on the afternoon of March 29th, at 8:30 PM, the head of the Shili Matou Branch, Meng, reported that while patrolling south of 13th Latitude Road, they encountered four bandits and engaged in a battle, requesting that police be dispatched to assist in the arrest. The branch immediately telegraphed the Dama Road Branch, and Police Chief Yang Pinliang led the police to Shili Matou to assist in the arrest. The outside duty bureau members Yang Xingyuan, Wen Xikun, and others also led many police officers to the Shili Matou Branch to assist in the arrest. After they left, Police Chief Yang Pinliang of Dama Road reported by phone that he was ordered to go to Shili Matou to assist in the arrest of bandits. On the way, they suddenly encountered a Japanese garrison of about one company, who surrounded and beat the police chief and chased them back to the branch office. The garrison then surrounded the police station and requested that personnel be dispatched to negotiate. The branch immediately dispatched Bureau Member Liu Pinzhang, Wang Xizhou, the director of the Foreign Affairs Section, and Section Member Wang Defu to negotiate. They telegraphed the general bureau. Chief Inspector Tai, Chen, the chief of the Judicial Section, Guan, the chief of the Administrative Section, and translator Wang, the technician, went to the Dama Road Branch for serious negotiations. The Japanese garrison's Second Lieutenant Zuo Tianzhong was extremely barbaric, threatening our police officers and negotiators with guns, forcing them to sign documents, monitoring their actions, and restricting their freedom. At this time, senior officials from the Japanese garrison, police department, and consulate were all present, but the garrison continued to act violently and did not yield. During the negotiations, another phone call came from Shili Matou, reporting that about fifty or sixty Japanese garrison soldiers had also surrounded the branch office and searched the luggage inside, requesting negotiations. After repeated negotiations, they claimed that our police had opened fire on the garrison and looted thirteen firearms and 253 rounds of ammunition, before withdrawing. It is found that our police were pursuing bandits in Shili Matou and within Chinese territory. The garrison conducted a nighttime field exercise without prior notice. This time, they misunderstood and used the excuse that our police had fired at them, beat police officers, insulted negotiators, and looted thirteen firearms and 253 rounds of ammunition. Please quickly send personnel to conduct serious negotiations based on reason to maintain our national dignity and respect our sovereignty." (March 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Opening of the Ye Yixiong Appeal Case <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The case of Ye Yixiong, a candidate judge of the Binjiang Special District Court, for premeditated attempted murder and embezzlement, was sentenced by the Shenyang District Court to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. Ye Yixiong did not accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court. The High Court then ordered Ye to hire a lawyer, but he failed to do so after many days. It also sent a letter to the Binjiang District Court to summon witnesses and the victim, Zhang Wang Liqing, to attend the hearing, but they did not appear. As a result, the hearing was repeatedly postponed. The High Court now believes that this case has attracted considerable social attention and cannot be delayed any longer. Today (the 31st), at 2:00 PM, it was publicly heard in the Fourth Tribunal. The victim, Zhang Wang Liqing, did not appear. Judge Chen Shuxian presided over the hearing and appointed lawyer Zi Zuobin to defend Ye. First, the judge asked Ye Yixiong the reasons for not accepting the original judgment. Ye then stated the reasons one by one. The main points were: (1) When did Ye load the bullets into the pistol? (2) Why did he abandon the pistol after the shooting? The draft was hidden in his socks, but why was Zhang Liqing's seal not hidden? (3) When Zhang Liqing was recuperating in the hospital, Ye's wife went to the hospital to request something, so Zhang's testimony during the public hearing was different from her testimony during the investigation, which was obviously due to the request. Ye testified, "First, the pistol bullets were loaded earlier. Second, the pistol was abandoned to avoid being searched. The seal was also hidden in a large medicine bag. The draft was Zhang Liqing's property and had to be kept, so it was hidden in my socks, and I could not obtain it without a guarantee. This draft was produced by myself after signing a guarantee at the road police station and was not searched out by the road police. I can summon and question. My wife's meeting with Zhang Liqing in the hospital did not happen. Newspaper reports are not credible." The judge then asked Ye if he had any requests to investigate the evidence. Ye made two requests in court: (1) The draft was taken out by himself and was not searched out by the road police. (2) The other party's investigation record and judgment were marked with a white paper, please investigate the presiding judge. Finally, Ye said that the previous investigation record in Binjiang was superficial and had many omissions, so the impact was great. This time, please read the record in court. The judge allowed it and ordered that the victim be summoned to court before the court was reopened for hearing, and then adjourned the court. (March 31st)</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Rectification Committee sent a telegram to Mo, the Plenipotentiary, yesterday, saying: "The country is in crisis. To Mr. Mo Dehui, the Chinese Plenipotentiary Representative to the Sino-Soviet Conference in Moscow, considering the Sino-Russian issue, last year, negotiations began in Russia, and the Russian side insisted on the illegal Boli Record, which eventually led to the unresolved Eastern Railway Incident.

<p>Shanghai Banking Circles Establish New Silk Factory in Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The China Sericulture Improvement Association established a seed-producing farm in Zhenjiang in 1927, using barren mountains. They purchased over 300 mu of land in Sichun Township Sibaidu, where the factory is located, and planted mulberry trees extensively. For four years, the scope of seed production at the farm has expanded from spring seeds to autumn seeds to original seeds. There are now more than ten nearby seed-producing farms, including Yonghe, Yumin, Mingming, the Women's Vocational School, Guanghua, Sipu, Yongren, Yongtai, Sanyi, Junyi, Yongan, and Xiehe. The sericulture industry in Zhenjiang is developing rapidly, but it has not yet attracted the attention of local people. However, when the Japanese came to Zhenjiang to visit last year, they became worried about the development of sericulture in Zhenjiang, and they paid special attention to the seed-producing farm of the Sericulture Improvement Association, because although the Japanese silk industry has achieved great success, it is limited by the lack of land for planting mulberry trees, which is not as easy to expand as in Zhenjiang. Currently, the banking circles in Shanghai feel that there is a surplus of cash, and they are also impressed by the increasing development of the sericulture industry in Zhenjiang. They plan to invest in Zhenjiang and establish a new silk factory. The factory site is south of the railway station, with a capital of 600,000 yuan. They also plan to purchase tens of thousands of acres of barren mountains in Gaozi Xiashuqiaotou to establish a large-scale seed-producing farm and livestock farm. Yesterday, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Wenbai, Wang Mengzhong, Lu Xuepu, Xu Jiyun, Jiang Chanshan, Li Chengyi, Chen Zhesheng, and others from the banking circles in Shanghai came to Zhenjiang for sightseeing. It is said that they are also planning this matter.</p>

<p>Director Lin Goes to Shanghai to Investigate the Second Prison: The Second Jiangsu Prison in Caohejing, Shanghai, is severely overcrowded with military and ordinary prisoners. It is imperative to find ways to alleviate the situation. Yesterday (the 4th), Director Lin of the High Court, Chief Prosecutor Wang Simao, and Chief Clerk Mu Bangen took a car to Shanghai in the afternoon to inspect the Second Prison and conduct design and dredging.</p>
<p>Petition from Fresh Fish Vendors: There are about 3,000 fresh fish vendors in this county. They trade with the fish market every day, calculating in "qian" (copper coins). For every 1,000 "qian," vendors could deduct a commission of 40 or 50 "qian" or increase to ocean prices of 100 wen per yuan when settling accounts at festivals. Now, the trade association, having been organized on its own initiative, abruptly changed the "qian" calculation to "ocean" calculation and canceled all items, such as commission ocean price increase, etc. The vendors received the news. The small-scale association's exploitative interest makes use of the society to demand extortion. They telegraphed the authorities requesting that the association be dissolved in accordance with Article 12 of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Associations, and that the association be ordered not to change the old business practices. After receiving the report, the county government ordered the Chamber of Commerce to investigate the situation, whether there should be any changes, and whether there were any obstacles, so as to discuss the matter thoroughly, to resolve the dispute, and to examine the situation, to convene both parties for fair treatment, and yesterday ordered the Fisheries Association to maintain the old practices.</p>
<p>Suspension of Incense Trade Association Activities: After a labor dispute arose in the incense industry, resulting in a strike, the county government, upon the instruction of the Provincial Construction Department, organized a mediation committee to handle the matter promptly.

Unexpectedly, the incense industry party did not send representatives to attend the meeting and instead issued a telegram, disregarding the Party branch. The County Party Branch decided that the association's actions were clearly escalating the dispute. Therefore, after a meeting, it was decided to order the association to cease its activities, remove all its original staff, and reorganize quietly.</p>

<p>Three Road Construction Projects Proceeding Simultaneously: Mao Feng, Director of the County Construction Bureau, is eager to complete the Wuxi-Yixing and Wuxi-Changzhou roads. He is expediting the various projects. The recent progress is recorded as follows: (1) The Wuxi-Yixing Road, according to the route plan approved by former Director Yao, is divided into four sections, passing through Da Xiaoxu Alley, Jikeng, Shibu, and directly to Guanjingkou. Director Mao believes that although this plan is more direct, it is actually difficult to build roads through mountains. Therefore, it was decided to change the route, building the road around the small mountains near Jikeng and Shibu, which will save both labor and time. This has already been submitted to the Provincial Construction Department for approval. (2) For the Wuxi-Changzhou Road, Zhou Jingyu, the acting director of the highway, has been sent with surveyors to measure the route. It has already passed Chajiaqiao to Houshan. The measurement can be completed in the shortest possible time, and construction will begin immediately. Ni Jianye, the district head of the second district through which the road passes, held a special meeting yesterday to discuss the conscription matters. It was decided to notify the households to be conscripted within five days to remove all obstacles within the route. (3) Only the southern section of the Wuxi-Chengjiang Road is currently open, up to Yanqiao. The northern section from Qingyang to Houteng has also been actively constructed. In addition, the section from Houteng to Nanzha has also been actively started. However, due to the exhaustion of funds, Director Mao previously borrowed 10,000 yuan from the Wuxi-Chengjiang Long-Distance Bus Company. To facilitate the progress of the project, he continued to borrow 5,000 yuan from the company and discussed the northern section project plan and fundraising methods with Li Leng, the County Magistrate of Jiangyin. It was submitted to the County Political Affairs Conference for discussion and decision to implement. It was decided that the entire Wuxi-Chengjiang Road could be opened to traffic within two months.</p>
<p>Ding Shuangsheng Silk Shop to Be Liquidated: Ding Shuangsheng Silk Shop on Da Shi Bridge is in trouble because shop owner Ding Hesheng and his brothers' silk cocoon business failed. This has caused depositors to rush to withdraw their money, leading to disputes. Depositors organized a creditors' group and found that the shop owed a total of 270,000 yuan in deposits, shop funds, customer funds, and collateral. After several meetings, on the 27th of last month, the creditors' group decided that Ding Shuangsheng should pay 20,000 yuan in cash in two installments on April 3rd and 10th, and then discuss future maintenance methods. Feng Xusan, the manager of the silk shop, stated at the scene that he was willing to take full responsibility. On the day before yesterday, when the first installment of 10,000 yuan was due, more than 100 creditors, men and women, gathered at the Chamber of Commerce to wait. At 5:00 PM, Ding Shuangsheng entrusted Ding Yuansheng, Assistant Ye Tongxuan, and Fan Jinwen Rongjianming to attend the meeting and claimed that although 10,000 yuan had been raised, there was no cash available to pay out today and requested an extension. The creditors believed that this was a deliberate delay and could not agree to it. It was impossible to maintain the status quo. They immediately obtained permission from the County Chamber of Commerce to seal up the goods in the shop that evening, together with the Silk and Cloth Trade Association and the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning, it was decided at the Chamber of Commerce to allow the inventory of the shop to be checked today (the 5th) and liquidated. It was also decided to hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court, requesting the seizure of the assets of Ding and manager Feng Xusan to pay off the debts.</p>
<p>Opium Trafficker Arrested and Sent to Court for Trial: A man from Anhui named Sun Lianxi has been engaged in opium trafficking for a long time. He has never been caught because of his cunning methods. At 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Sun carried a large amount of opium and arrived in Wuxi by train from Beijing, intending to sell it in the countryside. After getting off the train, he looked flustered and walked straight towards Zhou Shanbang. He was spotted by Fan Jinying, a railway police officer at the station, who suspected the passenger's behavior. He immediately went forward to search and found six packages of Sichuan opium (weighing ten pounds in total) in his rattan basket. He took the man and the evidence to the stationmaster's office. Yesterday, Ma Jirui, the head of the police section, prepared a document and sent him to the county court for trial.</p>

<p>Petition of Sandbar Residents Concerning River Dredging: In this county's Nansha District, the Sanzhangpu One, Two, Three, and Four Wo Rivers were jointly planned by Changshu and Taicang counties in the 13th year of the Republic of China, and it was decided to dredge them in sequence. The One, Two, and Three trunk rivers have already been completed, but the Four trunk river has not yet started construction. The farmers in the district believe that the Four trunk river is the lifeline of the entire water conservancy system. Although the One, Two, and Three trunk rivers provide drainage, the Four trunk river is necessary for the regional relationship. Chen Qiwei, the former director of the Construction Bureau, went to the province to meet with Sun, the director of the Construction Department, to request approval for the dredging of the Four trunk river, but Director Sun did not approve it due to a lack of funds. Now, 100,000 mu of farmland in the sandbar is about to become barren due to the lack of water conservancy. Therefore, the farmers in the district organized a large-scale petition meeting, electing more than 80 representatives to go to the city on the 1st to petition the Party and government organs for the dredging of the Fourth trunk river to benefit water conservancy. They first went to the county government, but the county magistrate had returned to his hometown, so Jin Minjun, the head of the First Section, received them and promised to report their intentions to the county magistrate in the future. Later, they went to the Construction Bureau and the County Party Branch to petition. It is reported that the representatives will go to the provincial government to petition again if the petition in the county is ineffective.</p>

<p>Extortionist Caught in Trap: Li Zongxin, who lives in Changgeng Lane, Genzi Street, in this city, used to work as a clerk in Yangzhou Customs. Since the customs was abolished, he has been living in leisure. Because he is often sick, his wife, Jiang, manages all the affairs in the family. On the twenty-fifth day of the lunar new year, the family's fur coats and other items were stolen. Because her husband was ill, the woman did not report the case. Recently, she learned that the surname Li had received three letters from bandits demanding 300 yuan. Yesterday (the 2nd), another letter came, ordering the money to be wrapped in newspapers and delivered to the land temple at the entrance of the alley. Jiang reported to the third police station under the jurisdiction, and Xu Patrol Officer designed a package in the same way, tied with linen rope, and fastened a copper bell to the linen rope. Four plainclothes policemen ambushed around the alley. At the appointed time, an old man named Li Dengxing came to the temple, took the newspaper package, and the police heard the bell sound of the paper bag and went forward to arrest him. Just out of the alley, a young man named Li Shanzhi, the owner of Li Rongsheng Paint Shop near the alley, went to the police and claimed that the person you arrested was his father and asked to be released immediately. Patrol Officer Xu believed that Li's father was highly suspicious and should not be released without authorization. He took Li Shanzhi with him for interrogation. Li's father and son both denied the matter. The patrol officer then ordered Li Dengxing to write numbers, which resembled the handwriting in the threatening letter. Then Li's father and son were sent to the first bureau for disposal. It is reported that Chen Peiqiu from Dai Chunlin Incense Powder Shop in Gengzi Street and other nine families submitted a request to the first bureau for guarantee.

<p>Jealousy Almost Leads to Murder: The wife of Yuan Laoren, a Wenzhou overseas Chinese in Jiaxing Jiaolidi Street, had an affair with her husband's nephew, Yuan Enpei, in her hometown of Wenzhou. After immigrating to Jiaxing, the aunt and nephew both built thatched houses on both sides of the river in Jiaolidi Street and rented land for planting to make a living. Her husband worked as a servant in Fengqiao village. Recently, the wife had a secret affair with her neighbor, Ye Hecan, which was discovered by Enpei. The night before last, he secretly went to his aunt's thatched house and entered the bedroom, but he did not find anyone and returned. The next night, the wife, believing that Enpei was of a lower status and should not interfere improperly, gathered Ye Hecan, Ye Heshang, Li Amao, and others, each holding weapons, and led them to twist and beat Enpei, causing him to be covered in bruises and unconscious. After someone reported to the Guanyinge police station, they sent police to take Enpei to the court for examination and then to Fuyin Hospital for treatment.

The Ministry of Education issued a survey form last year to investigate the status of secondary education across the country. The form was to be reported by the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities. The Ministry of Education also issued a telegram this year urging that it be expedited, but the departments and bureaus have not fully complied with the reporting requirements, and the names and numbers of public and private secondary schools across the country need to be verified. Therefore, it is not appropriate to delay any longer. The Ministry of Education has specially issued a simple survey form for public and private secondary schools in each province and city, asking the department to fill it out and send it to the Ministry within one week of receiving the document for preliminary calculation. Those who have not reported the 18-year secondary school survey statistics form or have not fully reported them should still expedite the reporting.

<p>Lu Lifan, Director of the Jiangyin Education Bureau, previously drafted a 19-year work plan and submitted it to the Department of Education for approval. The instructions from the Department are recorded below. (1) In addition to the county high school, there are public Nanshan and private Zhengcun in the urban area, and private Qingyang Yangshe Changjing three schools in the rural area. Graduates of primary schools in the county, both in the city and in the countryside, do not have to worry about not having a place to study. At this time, the funding for universal education is extremely scarce, and the county-level junior high school should indeed expand, and private high schools do not need subsidies. (2) Although senior grades in primary schools are needed, the county's education funds are insufficient for universal education, so additional grades cannot be added arbitrarily before additional funding can be raised to prevent abuses. (3) The academic performance of the special students recruited by the rural teachers' colleges is very poor and is accepted for accomodation. Recruitment should be stopped this year, and if teachers are needed, a one-year normal school should be opened to recruit junior high school graduates. (4) Since the county already has a practical elementary school and a rural teacher practical elementary school, they should be closed. (5) The name of the district representative should be abolished immediately. Those with good results should be changed to district-run, and those who are not well-run should be closed immediately. (6) The creation of the Party Boy Scout cause belongs to the scope of universal education and shall not use social education or voluntary funds.</p>

<p>Letter to the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Private universities in Shanghai that have been registered have petitioned the Ministry of Education for an allocation of funds for subsidies due to the need to increase school affairs and the economic difficulties. The original petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Ministry of Education for funding shortages and requesting allocation of funds for subsidies. All of our schools were founded by private individuals and have been funded by student tuition fees and donations from people in society over the years. We have worked hard to manage and the scale is rough. Since being registered by the Ministry, school affairs have become more developed, and the number of students has increased daily. However, in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry, the needs have also expanded daily. School buildings urgently need to be added and equipment urgently needs to be enriched. We are trying to support ourselves by patching things up, and the difficult situation has long been understood. Now that construction is in full swing, there is an urgent need for talent, and the number of national universities is not large, so young people who want to study have the concern of being left out. In the Party and the country, the authorities also feel the sigh of the difficulty of talent. Our schools cultivate specialized talents and research advanced academics. Our operations are no different from national universities, and the service of graduates to society is obvious. It is also no less than that of national universities. The funding for national universities is often hundreds of thousands to millions each year, while private universities have no help at all. The same education institutions, bearing the same responsibility for cultivating specialized talents, the treatment of the lush and withered is so different. How can this be called fair when we consider the principles of education? Last year, the Second National Education Conference passed the third article of the program for improving higher education. The first item stated that "Private universities, colleges, and specialized schools that have been registered and have excellent academic performance may be subsidized by the central or provincial government, or by the Ministry of Education in consultation with the Gengkuan Education Fund Committee." The eleventh item of the tenth article stipulated that "Starting from the 19th year, the central government should increase funding" and that "Subsidize 300,000 yuan for the expenses of registered private universities and specialized schools." The current economic situation of the schools is in urgent need of subsidies. We hereby jointly petition the Ministry to take the supreme intention of improving higher education and implement the plan of the previous National Education Conference, and quickly transfer it to the central government for allocation of funds for subsidies or transfer it to the Gengkuan Education Fund Committee for allocation of subsidies so that our schools can develop step by step according to the planned plan, then it is not just the good fortune of our schools, but the future of the Party and the country. Sincerely presented to the Minister of Education, Jiang.</p>

<p>City Scout Council Decides to Extend Term for Reorganization</p>
<p>The annual competition of the Boy Scouts Association initiated by the British Boy Scouts Association in this city has always attracted enthusiastic participation. This year, it will be held at the Merrimington Ground on Hongqiao Road at 6:30 PM on April 6th. Participants include teams from seven countries, with the Chinese team deciding to participate with the 64th Regiment and senior Boy Scouts. The City Boy Scout Council, to foster friendship among international Boy Scouts, has specially prepared a large silver shield to award to the winning international Boy Scout team. However, this silver shield is only allowed to be retained by the winning team for one year. If the team wins for three consecutive years, it will be permanently retained by that winning team.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since its establishment, the City Boy Scout Council will reach its term in June. According to Article 2 of the Organizational Regulations of the Special City Council of the Chinese Boy Scouts, it should have completed its term and held elections for the second council.

<p>—Yesterday's Victory over Scoder with a Score of Two to One</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Seibu football team defeated the Scoder team with a score of two to one at the Shen Garden, winning the Scott Cup. From now on, the three major championships of the Seibu Football Club's A-League competition, the Senior Cup and the Scott Cup, are all in the team's possession. They should be high-spirited and excited.</p>
<p>Seibu Team:</p>
<p>Weijinsheng</p>
<p>Scott: Helei, Toner</p>
<p>Blatt, Gaxu, Faras</p>
<p>Gibson, Huisihua, Jack</p>
<p>Yaklai</p>
<p>Scoder:</p>
<p>Dulai</p>
<p>Jemusi, HeleiDe, Hamildun</p>
<p>Marseis, Duge, Blatt</p>
<p>Gelaite, Nair, Simisi</p>
<p>Queerden</p>
<p>The Hero's Head Turns Out to be Extraordinary</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fierce battle, the Scoder team took the lead, but Seibu defended effectively, and a stalemate ensued. After thirty minutes, both sides' goals remained unscathed. At this time, the military goalkeeper Marseis caught the ball and kicked it forward fiercely. Seibu's general, center forward Farlas, with the ambition of "not entering the tiger's den, how can one obtain the tiger cubs," single-handedly attacked. The ball hit his head with a thud and rebounded into the net, achieving the first great success. The audience, half of whom were cheering for Seibu, responded with a great cheer.</p>
<p>Yellow-Haired Divine Foot Achieves a Surprise Victory</p>
<p>Weijinsheng, the famous left-winger on the sea, is also the reason why Seibu's forwards are more elite than other teams. Not three minutes after Seibu won the first goal, this famous left-winger dribbled the ball from the side to the center and shot towards the goal within five steps. The Scoder goalkeeper punched it out with one arm, fortunately without incident. After another seven minutes, Weijinsheng revisited the scene, and his divine leg swept across and succeeded, creating a 2-0 lead in the first half.</p>
<p>Dulai's Header Makes the Whole Field Pale</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Scoder's center forward Blatt injured his left foot and switched positions with right-winger Queerden. The spectators thought that the military's momentum would decline due to the injury of a major general. Unexpectedly, Scoder stood their ground with their backs to the water and their spirits were high. Seibu was instead trapped by them. Within ten steps of the goal, the Scoder army repeatedly shot, but because of aiming without targets, it was difficult to achieve results. In the last ten minutes, the Scoder army's midfielder made a very good pass, and the landing point was next to the goal. The left-winger Dulai headed the ball in, and the ball broke into the net. Scoder regained a goal and hope was born. Seeing the situation was not good, Seibu tried their best to defend, and finally won the Scoder team with a score of 2-1, winning the Scoto Cup. The referee was Li Nuosi, and the line judges were Le Xiurong and Fan Ensi.</p>

<p>Team Leader Song Ruhai Arrives in Shanghai Today - A Total of Twenty-Three Team Members</p>
<p>—The North China Team is Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Tonight—</p>
<p>The National Regional Football Competition will be held in Shanghai soon. Except for the South China team, which did not come due to unforeseen circumstances, the North China and Central China teams have participated to support the grand event. According to a reporter, this is the first time that the Huazhong football team has participated in the regional competition, opening a record in the history of Chinese sports. The team, led by Song Ruhai, has a total of twenty-three members and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. They are staying at the Yizhong Apartment on Pupo Road. Mr. Song will only be able to arrive here by plane today due to other matters. The reporter met with Mr. Zhou Qingxuan and Secretary Zhao Lanquan of the team yesterday, and their conversation is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The Recent Situation of Sports in Central China</p>
<p>Sports in Central China, especially in Hunan, used to be very developed. However, since the communists occupied Changsha, the schools have been burned down, education has been greatly impacted, and sports have also disappeared.</p>
<p>Recovery has been quite difficult. Jiangxi Province is still trapped in communist difficulties. Sichuan Province has little access due to transportation issues. Therefore, Wuhan should be the center. Wuhan University is still in its early stages and is still developing. Although Hankou's sports are very immature, the YMCA and the Hankou Sports Association have made great achievements in promoting them. Basketball and football teams have sprung up. The YMCA team has the strongest strength in basketball, and the Sanyu and Municipal Government teams in football. However, due to economic exhaustion and the lack of suitable venues, development has been slow.</p>
<p>Liu Wendao Enthusiastically Promotes Sports</p>
<p>This time, the Huazhong football team is traveling east. Economic difficulties are extremely difficult. The estimated cost is more than 1,000 yuan. At first, only more than 400 yuan was raised. Liu Wendao, the mayor of Hankou, generously donated 300 yuan to promote sports, showing great enthusiasm. Furthermore, there is no suitable football field in Hankou. Only a wasteland in the park is used to compete with Westerners. It is necessary to go to the Western Merchants Racecourse to receive their hospitality, which is truly embarrassing. The Municipal Government has passed a resolution to raise 900,000 yuan to build a large-scale sports field, which will be completed before September. The 5th Huazhong Games will be held here. Mr. Liu is actively preparing. In the future, the promotion of sports in Central China will rely on Mr. Liu's promotion.</p>
<p>Motivation for Participating in the Regional Competition</p>
<p>Mr. Song Ruhai spares no effort in promoting sports. He currently works at the Hankou YMCA, and the YMCA basketball team was trained by him. Mr. Song, seeing the lack of vitality in sports in Central China, worked hard to advocate the organization of a football team to participate in the National Regional Competition. After various difficulties, the representative team was finally produced. The purpose of this trip is to connect with all parties and arouse interest in sports in Central China. Knowing that the skills are inferior to others, victory or defeat is not the goal.</p>
<p>Representatives and Origin of Funding</p>
<p>Most of the Huazhong representative team was selected from the Hankou Municipal Government and the Sanyu Sports Association football teams. A football match was held with Tongwen in Jiujiang. Tongwen won the Huazhong Football Championship last year with a score of 1-0, but this year they lost to the Hankou team with a score of 1-2. In the end, it was decided that Hankou would represent the team. A telegram was sent to Tongwen to invite them to participate, but it is regrettable that the selected team members did not come. The funding was donated by the Municipal Government football team for 346 yuan, and Mayor Liu donated 300 yuan. There is still a large shortfall. Currently, Shen Siliang of the National Sports Association has agreed to make every effort to find a solution.</p>
<p>Huazhong Football Team Lineup</p>
<p>In addition to participating in the regional competition, the team will have several friendly matches. The team leader is Song Ruhai, the staff are Sun Honglie and Tang Xingtian, the secretary is Zhao Lanquan, and the lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Li Bizu</p>
<p>Zhou Qingxuan Zhou Fanwei</p>
<p>Lu Xuehai Wu Shirong</p>
<p>Yang Enci</p>
<p>Cheng Guoyin</p>
<p>Tang Shunhua Yu Keding Luo Jie</p>
<p>Zhu Rikui Li Benxin Yuan Qingwu</p>
<p>Zhao Lanquan</p>
<p>Kang Jingguang</p>
<p>Xin Xianyong Wang Yide</p>
<p>Cai Yidian Jin Huajin</p>
<p>Xiao Bo</p>
<p>—The North China Team Arrives Here Tonight—</p>
<p>—The Regional Competition is Postponed to Start on the 8th—</p>
<p>The North China Regional Football Representative Team was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai last night. Later, a telegram was received stating that they would not be able to arrive until 11:00 PM tonight. They will stay at the Jiande Savings Association. The regional competition will also be postponed. The North China vs. Central China match will be on the 8th, and the North China vs. East China match will be on the 12th.</p>

<p>First Day Record</p>
<p>The municipal fishery improvement promotion conference was inaugurated yesterday (the 4th) morning, with an attendance of no less than three thousand people, causing the auditorium (at the Minli Middle School Alliance) to be unusually crowded. Central representatives Yang Qingyuan, Mayor Zhang Yuejun, Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi (represented by Han Yougang), Ministry of Industry representatives Zou Bingwen and Li Dongxiang, City Party Committee Standing Committee member Wu Bokang, Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Director He Yushu, City Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, and others all arrived on time. Mayor Zhang presided over the meeting, with the conference's Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Hanmei and Chief Editor Zhou Jianyin recording the proceedings. The meeting commenced with the chairman's opening address (full text below), followed by speeches from central representatives and various organizations. Director He then delivered a reply speech. After the conference secretary-general reported on the preparations, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned. The conference then hosted a tour of the exhibition. At 2:00 PM, entertainment was held, including (1) a fishery film, (2) music by the Xinhua Art College, and (3) song and dance performances by the Sisters' Song and Dance Troupe. Over 5,600 people attended the conference and exhibition in succession, making it an unprecedented grand event in the fishery industry. The speeches are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mayor's Opening Remarks</p>
<p>The purpose of today's meeting is to conduct a grand promotion for China's coastal fishery. The decline of China's fishery did not begin today. Examining the reasons for its failure, half are due to foreign aggression, and half are due to our own lack of self-improvement. According to international law, all countries' fishing boats have freedom on the high seas, except within three nautical miles of the coast, which is reserved exclusively for the use of fishermen of the sovereign state. Foreign fishing is not allowed to intrude. Now, there are no less than sixty or seventy foreign vessels fishing in the waters off Jiangsu and Zhejiang in China. They started by using Taiwan as a base to invade the fisheries of our southern coastal provinces. Then, they used Qingdao and Dalian as bases to invade the fisheries of our northern coastal provinces. Recently, they want to use Shanghai as a base to invade the fisheries of our central coastal provinces. If we do not improve in time, our entire coastal fishery will fall into the hands of foreigners, and the livelihoods of our millions of coastal fishing households will be cut off. If the source of Chinese fish is cut off, then all the people in the country who eat fish will have to rely on foreign fish. This will not only add to the hundreds of millions of dollars in losses each year but also inflict a major blow on the super-national economy due to fish imports. And those who suffer will not only be a mere few million fishing households. Furthermore, the failure of our country's fishery lies in the lack of self-improvement of our country's fishermen. Today's world is a scientific world, and competition in industry and commerce is also nothing more than scientific competition. Therefore, the success or failure of competition always depends on the degree of scientific progress. The reliance of fisheries on science is no less than that of agriculture and mining. When the winds are treacherous, and the tides are irregular, we rely on meteorology; to operate boats and use nets, we rely on mechanics; to identify species and observe their movements, we rely on aquatic science. In addition, skillful storage and efficient marketing, all the techniques of industrial and commercial competition, are applicable to fishery, and the degree of danger in fishery is ten to a hundred times greater than in other industries and commerce. Now, our country's fishing industry clings to old ways, does not seek progress, or is content with fate, or is an accomplice to others. It is only a matter of time before our entire fishery is ruined. Now, this conference makes a loud and urgent appeal, saying: Fishery is the lifeline of our millions of fishing households, and it concerns the economy of our four hundred million compatriots. If we do not fight for it, we will never have a chance to rise again. The way to remedy this, in terms of fishery, is to feel the weight of responsibility and strive for improvement. In terms of society, we should know that fishery is related to the people's livelihood, and we should find ways to advocate for it so that talent and capital gradually gather. And the most important thing is that the national populace should support the government's diplomatic policy and eliminate all foreign aggression. Only then can our country's industry and commerce compete with the large industries and large businesses of the East and West. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Central Party Department Representative's Admonition</p>
<p>Central representative Yang Qingyuan delivered an admonitory speech, saying: Today, the Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality Fishery Improvement Promotion Conference is holding its opening ceremony here. I am very pleased to be here to participate on behalf of the Central Government. Among the production industries, fishery is a very important one. In primitive society, when people's knowledge was not advanced, they already knew how to fish. In the development history of various ethnic groups, there was a period of fishery society. In our country, nets were invented during the time of Fu Xi, more than four thousand years ago. Our country also has tens of thousands of miles of coastline. Based on this, fishery in our country should have long-term progress, and the amount of production should rank first in the world. But the facts tell me that our country's fishery has not only not progressed but is also declining day by day. Those engaged in fishery are either stagnant and complacent or become bandits. The reasons for this are: first, fishermen have immature knowledge and do not know how to apply scientific methods; second, the active aggression and destruction by imperialists. Countries such as England, Japan, America, and Russia apply scientific methods, strive to improve fishing gear, and constantly research. The government protects the fishery and makes every effort to reward it. Therefore, countries such as England, Japan, America, and Russia now produce several times more each year than our country. Even our country's markets are filled with foreign salted fish and fresh fish. If this continues and no remedy is found, not only will our millions of fishermen be at the end of their ropes, but the economic problems of the entire country will also be greatly affected, falling into an unmanageable situation. The Jiangsu and Shanghai party and government authorities, in view of this dangerous situation, initiated the organization of a fishery improvement promotion conference to display the fishery of this country and the fishery conditions of European and American countries in one hall, to awaken the Chinese people and to serve as a basis for research and progress. I hope that the representatives present will visit and then do their best to publicize it. It must be known that the improvement of fishery is not only the active reward and passive protection of the government, but also the efforts of the people to improve themselves in order to seek the improvement of health, the rapid progress of business, and the increase of production. In the future, efforts should be made in both economic talent and personnel. Then, the crisis of Chinese fishery can be easily resolved. I put forward this point, hoping that everyone will work hard to complete it.</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi's Speech</p>
<p>Jiangsu is the most important place for fishery in the Southeast. Taking the Shengshan fishing port as an example, fishing boats from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces gather there, numbering no less than several thousand. Other ports such as Lvsi and Xinyang are also abundant in marine products and densely populated with fishing boats. Therefore, the Premier's industrial plan includes the provision to construct fishery ports in various ports. Shanghai is China's only major trading port. The annual sales of domestic salted and fresh fish, combined with the output of foreign seas and rivers, are about 20 million yuan, while the sales and transit of foreign marine products are nearly 50 million yuan each year. Therefore, Shanghai is indeed a large market for marine products. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, the Agricultural and Mining Department, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, and the Jiangsu Provincial Fishery Experiment Station, in view of the importance of aquatic products in Jiangsu's position and the breadth of their sales, and deeply regretting that people in society are indifferent and do not pay much attention to this enterprise, have jointly organized a fishery improvement promotion conference. New fishing methods, books, and specimen displays are placed in the venue for people to visit, in order to promote social attention to fishery and to induce their entrepreneurial spirit. I very much approve of this. This department, as the highest competent authority for fishery administration, is well aware of the plight of coastal fishermen. Therefore, since its establishment, although only four months have passed, in terms of the passive aspect, it has already requested the State Council to pass the exemption of fish tax and fishery tax, in order to relieve the suffering of fishermen over the years. As for the active aspect, all aspects of promotion, protection, improvement, and crackdown are being carried out with all efforts and without any slackening. There are four points that can be reported to you: (1) Regarding promotion, such as the plan for ocean-going fishery incentive funds, is in fact due to the lack of entrepreneurial concepts in our country's fishery industry and the lack of attention to ocean-going fishery. Therefore, 250,000 yuan has been included in the national budget for the 20th year as ocean-going fishery incentive funds, and it is also planned to consult with the seven coastal provinces to also propose a corresponding bonus in the provincial budget to encourage newly built ocean-going fishing vessels to seek to initiate and guide the sound of ocean-going fishery. (2) Regarding protection, it is planned to establish four special management agencies for fishery protection in the seven coastal provinces, to purchase general-purpose ships to specifically prevent pirates and protect the safety of fishery. (3) Regarding improvement, fishery is different from various mechanical industries because marine conditions and climate are related to the growth of fish and their habitats also vary. Therefore, the fishing gear that is suitable for Country A may not be applicable to Country B. Therefore, the excellence of a country's fish catching, manufacturing, and aquaculture technologies relies on rich experience, and the acquisition of experience relies on experimentation. This department plans to include 500,000 yuan in the national budget for the 20th year to plan the establishment of a central model aquatic product experiment station to engage in experimental fishing, manufacturing, and aquaculture courses, and to set up two departments for publicity and lectures to transmit the results of experiments to fishermen so that those who operate in aquatic products have something to learn from. (4) Regarding crackdown, in recent years, foreign fishing boats have invaded, and everyone has known what the newspapers have reported. This department pays special attention to this, and has repeatedly discussed the crackdown methods at the State Council meeting and consulted with relevant parties. Now, a part of it has been resolved, and there are still those who should be dealt with through negotiation. In addition to always consulting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to proceed, the overall goal is to achieve a satisfactory resolution. In short, the construction of national undertakings requires the cooperation of the people and the government to be effective. Now, the decline of our country's fishery has reached its extreme. All the ends that should be prospered and reformed are numerous. However, if our people can be united from top to bottom and strive forward, then the already declining fishery can be restored in the shortest time, and the holding of this meeting today is not only not in vain, but will also greatly contribute to the improvement of our coastal fishery. This is what this department encourages itself, and it should also be what we encourage each other.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan's Speech</p>
<p>City Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, briefly stating that when we look at the depression of China's coastal fishery on the one hand, and the urgency of foreign fishing invasion on the other hand, we know that holding this improvement promotion conference today is really an urgent matter. At the same time, we know that if we want to seek the improvement of fishery, we must first pay attention to the consumption aspect of fishery, because fish are most easily corrupted. If consumption is not promoted, even if production increases, as a result of not being able to sell, they will only be sold at the lowest price, or even rot and be discarded. For example, all the fishing boats in Shanghai last year were greatly affected because Japanese fish were sold in large quantities in this city, resulting in low fish prices and unsustainable business. If Chinese fishery suddenly increases in production, and new fishing boats suddenly increase several times or dozens of times, I believe that the result will still tend to fail. Therefore, while we want to develop Jiangsu's fishery, it is especially necessary to plan the construction of the sales and consumption business in Shanghai, because Shanghai is the concentration of fishery in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and it is also one of the international markets. The reason why this conference is not held in the production area but in Shanghai is for this reason, etc.</p>
<p>Agricultural and Mining Department Director He Yushu's Reply Speech</p>
<p>China's coastal fishery has declined to the extreme. If we do not seek improvement, our millions of coastal fishermen will be finished. Finishing off millions of fishermen is the end of the matter. However, the forces of imperialism take the opportunity to invade, which not only finishes off the livelihoods of our millions of fishermen but also endangers the entire Chinese nation. Now, the Soviet Province and the Municipal Association have jointly organized this improvement promotion conference. Although they do not dare to say that there are any achievements, this play must be done. At the beginning of today's meeting, all sectors of society participated enthusiastically, which shows that society already has a considerable understanding of fishery. I hope that the people and the government will jointly do this play to promote and improve fishery in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e120">China Child Welfare Association Promotes Children's Day (Continued) <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Account of the Process</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association promotes Children's Day to the fathers and elders of the nation. The fathers and elders of the nation, the parents of children across the country, promote Children's Day and seek to open up sources of happiness for children across the country. The Child Welfare Association will take the lead in advocating Children's Day in China. It must inform the fathers and elders of the nation, the parents of children across the country. However, what we want to tell you is not to make the fathers and elders suddenly recognize Children's Day, but to first recognize the children themselves. It is also not to ask the fathers and elders to immediately promote Children's Day, but to first raise the status of children. Only in this way can we move from recognizing Children's Day to promoting Children's Day. We will use the following points to analyze these two perspectives: (1) Children with parents should no longer be regarded as the private property of their parents. Parents who regard children as their private property believe that children are born and raised by me, are my flesh and blood, my things that no one else can interfere with or have a share in. Since they belong to me, I have full power to control their life and death, their joys and sorrows, to do as I please, and no one dares to disobey. If there is any violation, they will be denounced as unfilial, evil, beasts, snakes, or scorpions, and either publicly sent to law or privately expelled. Such facts and news can still be seen and heard in the newspapers here. They do not know that children are the children of society and the nation, not the private property of the parents who give birth to and raise them. And the nurture and cultivation of parents is also their obligation to their children and their responsibility to the country. Therefore, those who previously regarded the achievement of their children as bringing glory to their ancestors must now change to regarding the achievement of their children as strengthening the country and benefiting the people. Those who previously regarded children as inheriting their parents' business and family must now regard children as workers who bear social responsibilities and leaders who take on national affairs. If we can change from that kind of erroneous concept to this clear understanding, it is not only recognizing children but also recognizing Children's Day. (2) Children without parents should no longer be regarded as social tumors. Children who are social tumors are abandoned on the roadside and left in the wilderness because they have no father or no mother or no parents at all. If they are fortunate enough to be glimpsed by compassionate and benevolent people, they will either be taken in or kept and raised. Although their intentions are very good, they always think that there are not many of these children, and it is not a loss to get rid of them. They only think about saving their lives, doing good deeds, and accumulating virtue for their descendants. Therefore, these children are regarded as social tumors. Those who see them call them "orphans" and "wretched children." Orphans and wretched children have become a special class, ostracized by the people and unwelcome by the country. Such popular concepts and measures can be seen clearly like a movie with just a glance and a thought. They do not know that all children, whether with or without parents, are children of the nation and children of society. Those with parents must be responsible for education and upbringing on behalf of the country, while those without parents must naturally have the responsibility for education and upbringing borne by the national government or the public parents of society. They must not be despised as social tumors or national parasites because they have no parents. If members of society take the public parents of these children without parents as their responsibility, and the national government can also do so, then what is the difference between these children without parents and those with parents? What is the difference between their future achievements and those of children with parents? If the fathers and elders can recognize themselves as the public parents of children without parents, then they can also proceed to recognize Children's Day. (3) The benefits of family and society should no longer be grown into the patent of adults. When we open our eyes and look around, we can see everywhere that the current equipment in families and the arrangements in society are all for the enjoyment of adults, and very few are planned for children. On average, there is one child in every family of four or more people, so children account for a quarter of the social population. Moreover, in terms of family, children spend more time in the family than adults who go out early and return late. In terms of society, children have more leisure time than adults. It is only right that more toys, books, and supplies should be provided for children in families so that children can take advantage of the longer time spent in the family to self-educate. In society, more parks, playgrounds, libraries, and schools should also be arranged for children so that children can take advantage of the more free time in society.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Ultimate Fate of Tuberculosis Bacteria (Translated from a German Journal on Pulmonary Tuberculosis) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Pathogenic Bacteria of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Since Dr. Robert Koch of Germany announced the discovery of the tuberculosis bacterium as the pathogen of pulmonary tuberculosis, medical professionals have generally been able to transplant purely cultured tuberculosis bacteria into guinea pigs, causing them to develop the same tuberculosis. Tuberculosis bacteria can be cultured in bouillon-based agar and coagulated blood serum containing glycerol. However, their development is quite selective and completely different from that of other bacteria. The shape of tuberculosis bacteria is similar to that of a rod. They are non-motile and extremely small. They may be straight or curved. They can only be seen with the naked eye when thousands of them are gathered in one place. To cover the small area of a postage stamp, 16 million tuberculosis bacteria are required. As for their method of reproduction, it is based on their own fission process, dividing from one into two, two into four, and four into eight, gradually doubling. Therefore, the rate of reproduction is extremely alarming. If allowed to reproduce in a suitable environment, a single bacterium will multiply into millions in a single day. These bacteria often cluster in the sputum of tuberculosis patients. According to Dr. Haelre, one lump of sputum from a tuberculosis patient contains more than 300 million tuberculosis bacteria. If the patient expectorates sputum once every hour, then 7.2 billion tuberculosis bacteria will be discharged from the patient's lungs and spread into the air throughout the day. People are attacked by them morning and evening. However, the patient does not reduce their number by discharging them because tuberculosis bacteria, as mentioned above, divide and reproduce without stopping, and their power gradually increases. Now, let us assume that their rate of increase is one fission process every hour. Then, in 24 hours, one tuberculosis bacterium will suddenly transform into more than 16 million. Is this not frightening?</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Resistance of Tuberculosis Bacteria <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The reproductive power of tuberculosis bacteria is alarming, as mentioned above. But their resistance is even more terrifying. If the sputum of a tuberculosis patient is exposed to the air, the tuberculosis bacteria can survive for more than half a year. If placed in a dark room, they can still survive for more than a year. However, tuberculosis bacteria cannot reproduce very well outside the human or animal body and have little resistance to sunlight. They are easily killed if directly exposed to strong light. This is because the temperature has a great influence on these bacteria. They generally die in six hours at a temperature of 50 degrees Celsius, die in one hour at 60 degrees, and die in two minutes at 90 degrees. In addition to temperature, their resistance to many chemical drugs is surprisingly high. They do not die even after 24 hours in a mercury chloride solution with a concentration of 0.2%. If 5% carbolic acid solution is added and stirred once, or if pure alcohol is added to the sputum in about ten times the amount, they will die only after 24 hours.</p>
<p>It is well known that tuberculosis is a chronic disease that is difficult to cure. There is no need to elaborate. This is because tuberculosis bacteria can secrete an acid-resistant waxy substance from their own bodies, which encapsulates the bacterial body as a protective armor. Therefore, they are most resistant to general chemical drugs. In addition, the part that stimulates their attachment and reproduction forms extremely strong nodules, so that all bactericidal drugs cannot reach their bacterial bodies. Alas, the greatest difficulty for doctors in the East and West in researching tuberculosis bactericides has always been this point. The bactericides and disinfectants that we call today are all protoplasmic toxins, and what can kill bacteria can also destroy the cells and tissues of the body. Therefore, the ideal therapeutic agent for tuberculosis that the medical community hopes for today must have the following prerequisites:</p>
<p>(1) Any drug that can penetrate into the tuberculous body and can directly act on tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>(2) It can also strip and dissolve the acid-resistant waxy membrane LIPOD of tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>(3) It can completely kill tuberculosis bacteria without harming the human body.</p>

<h3 id="e123">New Medical Technique for Devaxing and Destroying Tuberculosis Bacteria <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis) is tuberculosis bacteria. When this bacterium enters the human body, it forms a nodule at that location, blocking the path of blood circulation. In addition, tuberculosis bacteria can secrete an acid-resistant waxy substance, which surrounds their bodies to prevent the invasion of all external drug forces. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are taken internally or injected, they cannot reach the substance of the bacteria. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, serum therapy, drug therapy, and all other therapies that doctors have always used have not been completely successful. And the saying that there is no medicine for tuberculosis is prevalent in the world because they do not know this profound theory. Therefore, modern tuberculosis scholars have continued to study based on the above-mentioned theory without sparing any effort. As a result, this chemical holy drug that can kill all tuberculosis bacteria has been developed, called Sanosin. This drug was successfully developed in accordance with the latest medical theories of Dr. Robert Koch of Germany, the discoverer of tuberculosis bacteria, and Dr. De or Bergier, the inventor of tuberculosis bacteria devaxing technology. According to the current experimental reports of various tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules of pulmonary tuberculosis foci and dissolving waxy substances. It also has bactericidal power and can radically cure first, second, and third stage tuberculosis. It is indeed a special medicine with ten thousand tests and ten thousand spirits. In China, the National Government Central Health Experimental Institute has tested it. The medicinal properties are mild and non-toxic, and there are no side effects whatsoever. The following briefly describes the therapeutic effects:</p>
<p>(1) If the medicinal power of (Sanosin) is tested in a test tube, the acid resistance of tuberculosis bacteria will disappear after one minute. After three minutes, the tuberculosis bacteria will be completely killed, with none spared.</p>
<p>(2) According to animal experiments, it was found that (Sanosin) can penetrate into the tuberculosis foci. If the latent tuberculosis bacteria in the foci are examined, they all lose their acid resistance. This proves that the waxy substance has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If the patient takes (Sanosin) internally for about a week, a good condition such as thinning of expectoration and lowering of body temperature will be seen immediately.</p>
<p>(4) If (Sanosin) is continued to be taken internally for more than thirty to sixty days, a significant increase in body weight and appetite will be seen, and all symptoms will gradually ease, eventually achieving the great feat of returning to life.</p>

<p>Shanghai Renji Road No. 35 (at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Renji Road), American Spencer Trading Company, Scientific Department.  It's said that education is important for cultivating talent, but what equipment do today's families have for children? What arrangements does today's society have for children? If elders can pay attention to this point, transforming families and societies that only benefit adults into families and societies that equally benefit both adults and children, then the elders have raised the status of children. Only then can one advocate for Children's Day. (4) Children are the hands of national construction and the feet that propel the world. As the West says, "The progress of national civilization follows the footsteps of children," and "Children are the movers of the Earth." The Chinese philosopher Confucius said, "The younger generation is to be held in awe," and Zhuangzi said, "It takes a hundred years to grow a tree." All these statements show the importance of children. From the small nation to the large world, everything relies on their construction and awaits their propulsion. Therefore, I label them as "Children are the hands of national construction and the feet that propel the world." How elevated is their position?  Unfortunately, those in our country's society who call themselves adults often regard themselves as omnipotent, seeing children as insignificant, elevating themselves above all else, and treating children as small dogs at their knees. Children's opinions are not respected, and their aspirations receive little guidance. If children do wrong, it is considered not their responsibility. If children become failures, it is attributed to fate. All these actions erase children's individual abilities, destroy their development, lower their status, and extinguish the entire happiness of the nation and the world like a raging flood.</p>
<p>I hope the elders recognize that today's children are tomorrow's leaders of the nation and society. And having good leaders in the nation and society depends on changing old concepts and engaging in new methods of educating and nurturing children. With good leaders in each nation and society, the world can be advanced. Understanding this point will further elevate the status of children, and advocating for Children's Day will naturally follow. At this point, the elders may inevitably ask, "What is the meaning of Children's Day?" And "Why must the promotion of Children's Day begin with an understanding of children themselves and the elevation of their status?" The answer is that Children's Day is meant for the entire nation to unite on April 4th to think about, seek, and implement the status, rights, and happiness of children. The promotion of Children's Day naturally depends on first understanding children themselves, elevating their status, and striving for years of effort to achieve success over a century-long period. What is showcased on April 4th is nothing more than an opportunity for the promoters to report on their achievements.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Conflict Between Tram Ticket Inspector and Shipyard Craftsmen <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Zhang Appointed to Mediate</p>
<p>The details of the conflict between Zhou Xiaoliu and Lin Honghai, craftsmen at the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Ministry of Navy, and a ticket inspector from the China Merchants Tram Company, were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Mayor Zhang Yuejun has been appointed to mediate. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor's Appointment to Mediate: After the incident occurred the day before yesterday, Director Chen Shaokuan of the Jiangnan Shipyard happened to be in Shanghai. He ordered the commander of the guard battalion, Ye Binqi, to go to the tram company and request that the manager of the tram company, Lu Bohong, come to the shipyard within an hour to discuss a solution. After Mayor Zhang heard about this, fearing the matter would escalate, he immediately contacted Chen by telephone, saying that he would be responsible for mediating everything. Chen expressed his agreement to Mayor Zhang's appointment to mediate and dispatched Wang Shouting, captain of the Hai Rong warship, and Li Mengbin, captain of the Hai Chou warship, to be responsible for discussing the incident with Mayor Zhang. It is hoped that a satisfactory solution can be reached in the shortest possible time. That evening, Chen took a train back to Beijing.</p>
<p>Company's Perspective: Lu Bohong, the general manager of the company, went to the municipal government at 10:00 AM yesterday to meet with Mayor Zhang. After reporting the details of the incident, Mayor Zhang met with him and mediated the case between the two parties, seeking a fair and peaceful solution. The company's previous request to the Public Utilities Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau to mediate the case of temporarily maintaining the issuance of tram passes to the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Ordnance Factory in 1927, with the factory subsidizing the company for the pass fees on a monthly basis, had not been resolved. As a result, conflicts have occurred from time to time between the tram workers and the factory workers. Therefore, it is hoped that the tram passes can be resolved through various methods during this period to avoid future incidents. It is said that this matter will likely be resolved together.</p>
<p>Workers' Perspective: Yesterday, the Jiangnan Shipyard Labor Union and the Shanghai South Water and Electricity Labor Union issued separate declarations, each holding its own position. Subsequently, due to the mediation of Lu Bohong, the general manager of the company, and the higher-level authorities, Mayor Zhang and Vice Minister Chen, it is expected that the matter will be handled fairly. Therefore, the workers on both sides are waiting quietly for the authorities to handle it. There were no other actions yesterday, and they continued to work as usual.</p>
<p>Various News from Both Sides: Yesterday morning, Chen contacted the shipyard from Beijing by long-distance telephone, ordering the craftsmen to work calmly and quietly on the one hand, and instructing the section to draft a letter (recorded later) to Mayor Zhang Qun, requesting the punishment of the instigator on the other hand. However, the Jiangnan Shipyard Labor Union issued a declaration yesterday (omitted) and a public statement (omitted). Their anger was still unable to dissipate for a while. The China Merchants Tram Company also submitted the blurred pass No. ○661 of Zhou Xiaoliu, along with the report of the inspector and ticket seller and the injury certificate from the Shanghai Hospital, to the authorities for handling. The letter from Chen Shaokuan, Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, to Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun, and the Labor Union's proclamation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from Director Chen: Respectfully, at 12:50 PM on the 3rd of this month, Zhou Xiaoliu, a worker from our shipyard, was on the No. 4 tram of the China Merchants Tram Company. The ticket seller No. 12 inspected his tram pass and claimed that the photo was blurred. The ticket seller forcibly confiscated the pass and forcibly removed the badge given to Zhou Xiaoliu by our shipyard. Zhou argued, and when the tram arrived in front of the tram company, the ticket seller gathered a crowd to beat Zhou and tried to drag him into the company. Lin Honghai, a worker from our shipyard, stepped forward to mediate but was instead resented and handed over to the police. At that time, all the workers in our shipyard received the news. Angered by the repeated arrests, beatings, and insults by the tram company, they immediately went on strike and were about to go to the company to argue. For the sake of local stability, our shipyard agreed to take responsibility for handling the matter and persuaded them to wait quietly for a resolution. The workers' tram passes have been used for a long time, and our shipyard has repeatedly sent letters urging for replacements, but the company has always delayed and eventually ignored them. In fact, they intentionally made the passes blurred in order to gradually confiscate and destroy them, allowing their ticket inspectors and ticket sellers to pick on people in various ways, causing disputes, blaming the workers, and fabricating false statements to deceive the public. This time, they even dared to remove our shipyard's badge without authorization and arrest our shipyard's craftsmen. This is an extreme insult to our shipyard. To trace the origin of the disaster, it is imperative to severely punish the manager of the company. Accordingly, I am writing to request that your municipal government order the arrest and punishment of the manager of the company to punish the instigator and appease public anger. As for the losses suffered by our shipyard due to the company's incitement of trouble and causing a strike, they should also be ordered to compensate. I would appreciate it if you could inform us of how to handle this matter. Respectfully, [signed] Chen, Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, to Zhang, Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>
<p>Shipyard Labor Union's Proclamation: For the matter of the proclamation: Regarding the dispute between the workers of the China Merchants Tram Company and members of our union yesterday, the facts have been reported and filed. We have received instructions to have the director take responsibility for handling the matter, and all craftsmen should work calmly and wait for a resolution, etc. Therefore, we hereby issue this proclamation for your information.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 4th) was the second day of the 12th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Medical and Pharmaceutical Association.

<p>Allocates 570,000 Yuan for Educational Expenses</p>
<p>Partially Allocated to Prepare for the Livelihood of Foil Workers</p>
<p>The Foil Industry Association previously asked the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, urging it to correct the business tax on foil products in Zhejiang Province in order to reduce the burden on merchants. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed back to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying that it previously received the association's telegram requesting the cancellation of the business tax on foil products in Zhejiang and the return of the taxes already collected. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance reported that this foil tax was previously decided by the Provincial Government Committee to be changed to a special business tax on foil products, which will continue to be collected according to the old regulations. The Zhejiang Provincial Government also reported to the ministry for review. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 390, stating that the foil tax is unique to Zhejiang Province and that the revenue has been designated for educational expenses and Zhejiang provincial expenses, which will continue to be handled by Zhejiang Province as originally approved. Furthermore, the Provincial Government Committee agreed that foil products are entirely superstitious items and were previously ordered by the central government to be banned. The former provincial government presented a request for temporary postponement of the implementation due to the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of foil workers and stated that this type of business should be treated with the intention of prohibiting it through taxation and cannot be compared with other ordinary businesses. In addition, the majority of these foil products are sold in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, so it is named the Special Business Tax on Foil Products in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces. From the former special tax on foil products, 300,000 yuan per year was originally allocated to the central educational expenses, and 270,000 yuan per year to Jiangsu Province, which will continue to be allocated by Zhejiang Province as originally approved. In addition, a portion will be allocated to prepare for the livelihood of foil workers. The Jiangsu Department of Finance was also consulted, stating that foil products from Zhejiang sold in Jiangsu Province will no longer be subject to other taxes to avoid double taxation and comply with the spirit of the Executive Yuan's order to handle the matter as originally approved. The ministry has already issued instructions in addition to notifying you by telegram. [signed] Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Business Tax Certificates for Various Industries Should Be Applied for with the Seal of the Trade Association <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Negotiate with the Financial Authorities</p>
<p>The Tax Regulations Research Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Trade Associations sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the issuance of business tax certificates, requesting negotiation for the application with the seal of each industry association. The letter stated: Respectfully, we have examined Article 10 of the revised Zhejiang Provincial Business Tax Regulations by the Ministry of Finance, which states that the calculation of the business tax amount is based on the industry. If a household engages in several businesses with different tax rates, it should be determined according to the main part of its business. Article 12 of the same regulations states that businesses should report the following items to the collecting agency within one month after the promulgation of these regulations and within the last month of each year thereafter to apply for a business certificate. The regulations stipulate that newly established businesses should report before starting their business. In terms of its meaning, the collection of business tax is based on the industry, and applying for a business certificate is the first step before starting business or collecting taxes. In the future, when Shanghai launches business tax, it should follow the same procedure. However, Shanghai's commercial market is prosperous, and the division of industries is very strict. Some industries are similar in form but different in reality, and some are the same in reality but operate in different ways. As for what is the main part, it cannot be distinguished by those who do not understand the situation in the industry. However, the organization of the industry association is based on the industry. Examining the laws and regulations of the industrial and commercial associations and observing the situation of each industry association, one can understand without a doubt that the issuance of a business certificate can be filled out by the operator and handed over to the affiliated industry association for sealing and certification. If it has not been sealed and certified by the industry association, it will not be issued. This will prevent confusion in the collecting agency and provide convenience for taxpayers. It is a win-win situation. It is hereby resolved by the ninth committee meeting of our association to transfer the request to your association to negotiate with the municipal financial authorities to ensure that the seal is issued, and a case is recorded accordingly and sent to the association for your review and handling. Sincerely, [signed].</p>

<p>At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the parking lot of the Shanghai South Public Bus Company, located south of the Siming Guild Hall on Xinqiao Road in the South City, destroying a total of twenty-one buses, with losses exceeding 60,000 yuan. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Development of Public Bus Business: The Shanghai South Public Bus Company has been in operation for three years, and the routes have been expanded to four. The first route starts from Lao Ximen, passes through Guohuo Road, and circles to the Sixteenth Pier. The second route goes between Longhua and West Gate. The third route goes along Zhonghua Road. The fourth route starts from Xujiahui in West Shanghai and goes to the Hongqiao Road Airport. Recently, since April 1st, a special bus for Longhua has been added, and the business is growing daily, with the number of vehicles increasing to more than forty. There is still a situation where supply cannot meet demand.</p>
<p>Red-Hot Soldering Iron Accidentally Touches Gasoline: Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhuang Baogen, a lead plumber, was repairing the No. 8 bus in the parking lot of the company's parking lot south of the Siming Guild Hall on Xinqiao Road when he accidentally touched the red-hot soldering iron to the gasoline, suddenly starting a fire that quickly spread. At that time, it was late at night, and all the workers in the factory had returned home to sleep and could not rescue it.</p>
<p>Twenty-One Buses Burned: The fire was extremely fierce at the time. Fortunately, the fire brigades from various districts heard the alarm one after another and drove to rescue it. The fire lasted for an hour and thirty minutes before being extinguished at 3:30 AM. A total of five Qianyi Musi brand cars, two Dodge brand cars, two Ford brand cars, and twelve Chevrolet brand cars were destroyed.

<p>Both the Bus Factory and the Houses Were Insured: After the incident, Director Wang of the Second District sent an inspector to investigate the truth of the fire. Soon after, the factory director Ni Pihuan sent a letter to Director Wang, stating that the factory buildings were insured for 4,000 taels of silver and the 35 buses were insured for 52,500 taels of silver. The British Norwegian Qiyou Ning Insurance Company insured 7/12 and the Phoenix Insurance Company insured 5/12, it is said.</p>
<p>The Company Discusses Post-Disaster Issues: Zhuang Baogen, the lead plumber who caused the disaster, fled the scene at the time and was subsequently located. The factory director sent a letter to Director Wang with Zhuang and Zhang A'si (32 years old, from Taizhou), the worker on duty, both of whom were sent to the Second District. After Director Wang's detailed questioning, except for Zhang A'si, who was temporarily released on bail by the factory, Zhuang Baogen, the lead plumber, was temporarily detained in the district, waiting to be sent to the General Bureau for handling. The company then convened an emergency meeting of the directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon, deciding to reorganize the remaining vehicles to maintain traffic on the second and third routes and to quickly find ways to restore the original state of the first and fourth routes, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Attempted Kidnapping of Zhu Ligeng Fails <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Cabby Cleverly Presses Alarm Bell to Report Arrest</p>
<p>Bodyguard Courageously Opens Fire on Bandits</p>
<p>Zhu Ligeng, a local who runs the Zhongfu Silk Factory at No. 28 Jinling Road in Zhabei, lives at No. 215 Changsha Road in the Public Concession. He owns a car, registration number 10320. Because he has been receiving threatening letters demanding large sums of money, Zhu hired a bodyguard named Wang Xuesheng, who carried a handgun, for safety and to accompany him in and out to prepare for any eventuality. At around 8:30 AM yesterday morning, Zhu intended to go to the factory in Zhabei to take care of matters and ordered the driver Chen Xiangyun, assistant Wang A'san, and the bodyguard to be ready. Just as Zhu Ligeng was about to step into the car, four kidnappers suddenly stepped forward. Three of the kidnappers held handguns, forcing the driver and others to get out of the car. They ordered Zhu to get into the car. Fortunately, the driver Chen Xiangyun was quite clever. After getting out of the car, he immediately ran back into the room and pressed the alarm bell, reporting to the Xinza police station. At this time, the bodyguard Wang Xuesheng also displayed great courage. In order to preemptively strike, he drew his handgun and opened fire on the bandits, firing five bullets, none of which hit. However, the kidnappers did not dare to take action at this point and had to abandon their attempt to kidnap the wealthy and flee for their lives. Soon after, armed Chinese and foreign detectives from the Xinza police station rushed to the scene and surrounded and searched the area. However, the bandits had already fled far away and could not be traced. They had no choice but to search the surrounding area and arrest two suspects, taking them to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Dog Racing is Banned <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Police Station Dispatches Police to Prohibit Vehicle Traffic</p>
<p>Ming Garden Only Held One Race Last Night Before Ceasing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Board has decided to prohibit dog racing gambling in the concession from the 1st of this month. Yesterday was the dog racing period at Ming Garden. In order to implement the ban, the Huishan police station first dispatched Chinese and foreign armed police officers to block all roads leading to Ming Garden from 7:00 PM last night, prohibiting vehicles from traveling. Pedestrians were allowed to pass on foot. Sixty Chinese and foreign police officers were dispatched to station at each entrance of Ming Garden, allowing people to exit but not to enter. In addition, there were two large red police vehicles full of police officers parked nearby to prevent accidents. However, the lights at the Ming Garden dog racing track were still brightly lit as usual. About forty members had already entered the venue early. At 8:30 PM, they actually held one dog race before ceasing. This can be said to be the last burst of light from the end of the world for dog racing. Before long, the dog racing staff and members in the venue left one after another, chatting and laughing nonchalantly. The police did not interfere. A Western woman holding fresh flowers joked with a Western police officer, saying that she lost 40 yuan in the one race. At that time, most of the lights in the venue were also turned off one after another. At 9:15 PM, the roads were reopened to traffic. Seeing that there was no activity at the dog racing track, the Western police chief ordered the Chinese and foreign police officers at the entrance of Ming Garden to march away in formation. As for Shen Garden, there was no activity at all last night.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Order to Close Temples Set Up in Rented Houses <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Instructions from the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Instructions from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau: In order to comply with the order, it has been found that temples set up in rented houses in this city were originally limited to the end of 1930 and must be ordered to close down. Subsequently, Municipal Government Instruction No. 6805 was received, stating that the request from the Chinese Buddhist Association to postpone the ban should be approved and ordered to be reviewed and reported by this bureau. It was then proposed to extend the deadline by three months to the end of March this year. Subsequently, Municipal Government Instruction No. 8632 was received and approved, and an order was issued for compliance. Now that the deadline has expired, the ban should be implemented. However, it is feared that the abbots of these temples may use excuses to delay or resist compliance. In addition to issuing instructions, we hereby order the director to follow the instructions and inform the staff to first notify and then set a deadline of five days. If they do not comply, they will be executed on their behalf in accordance with the Administrative Execution Law. All idols and Bodhisattvas can be sent to nearby temples, and a report on the compliance should be submitted. This order is issued on April of the Republic of China. [signed] Chen Xizeng, Director of the Bureau.</p>

<p>The notorious bandits, Zhang Amao and Gui Jinhua, both from Ningbo, repeatedly opened fire in the Public Concession between May and October of the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1928], killing people. For example, Yu Shunxiang was killed in Chengji Lane on North Zhejiang Road, Wu Pengfei was killed in Ruikang Lane on East Jiaxing Road, and Wang Chengcai was killed on Zhaofeng Road. When Western Constable Bai Laosi saw this and tried to arrest them, he was also shot and killed. They also shot and killed the English woman, Thomson, on Route des Soeurs. After being arrested by the Laozha [Old Gate] Police Station and brought to court, they were both sentenced to death. The sentence was reported to the provincial government, and approval for execution by hanging was received. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court ordered the police station to bring the two convicts, Zhang and Gui, from the Western Prison. Judge Cheng questioned them about any last words. Both convicts said that since their death was imminent, notifying their families would only increase their sorrow, so they had nothing else to say, only requesting wine and food. Judge Cheng then ordered a court clerk to purchase food. After they finished eating, they were escorted onto a prison van and sent to the Jiangsu Second Prison execution ground in Caohejing. A letter was sent to the Shanghai Local Court requesting them to send an executioner and a supervising prosecutor to the scene. Zhang and Gui were brought forward again, their identities were verified, and then the executioner tied them up and hanged them according to the law. The gallows were sealed, and the bodies were left exposed overnight as usual. After re-examination this morning, the bodies were claimed by relatives for burial.</p>

<p>Chen Mingqian, a native of Sichuan and the current Brigade Commander of the 9th Brigade of the 24th Army of the National Revolutionary Army, lives at No. 8 Guofumen Road in the French Concession. Yesterday morning, at about 8:00 AM, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived, most of them armed with pistols. They forbade anyone from making a sound and first drove everyone in the house into one room. The thieves then divided up and searched the house upstairs and downstairs. After about a quarter of an hour, they each carried away their loot and disappeared without a trace. It is estimated that over one thousand silver dollars and about six thousand dollars worth of leather clothing and gold jewelry were stolen. Before leaving, they also forced Chen's family to sign a check for ten thousand dollars. The victim then filed a loss report with the police station, requesting them to investigate and apprehend the robbers.</p>

<p>The Master's Relative Initiated the Robbery</p>
<p>Currently a Member of the Zhabei Defense Corps</p>
<p>Ma Yuankai, a native of Chuansha and an employee of the Shenchang Foreign Firm at No. 622 Xipuyi Lane, Qipu Road, South Area of the Special District Court, was robbed of cash, clothes, and jewelry on the 1st of this month, as reported in the previous newspaper. It has now been learned that the robbery was initiated by Wang Agen, a relative of Ma. Wang lives at No. 124 Song Park Road, Zhabei, and is currently a member of the Zhabei Defense Corps. At the time, Wang colluded with Yan Lingxiang, a local, Wang Nanrong, from Shaonan, and Xiao Guisheng, and others, and went to Ma's house to rob him. After the robbery, an internal conflict arose due to the uneven distribution of the loot. Yan turned himself in to the General Police Station the day before yesterday. He confessed that he had received a raccoon fur coat, which he had already pawned. He presented the pawn ticket. He also stated that Xiao lived at No. 11 Huaanfang, Huaxing Road, Zhabei, and that Wang Nanrong was playing in the China Park on Sichuan Road. The head constable immediately sent Detective Xie Shuiquan and Detective Zhao Zifang to the park first and arrested Wang Nanrong. Then they went to Zhabei, and together with the police detectives, they arrested Wang and Xiao. Yesterday morning, the police bureau of the area brought the two robbers to the Special District Local Court. Judge Zhou interrogated them. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu briefly described the case and requested that a document be sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to transfer the two robbers to custody for further investigation. Western Detective Mei Sheng presented a blade and a pistol that the robbers had abandoned at the victim's home while fleeing. However, the pistol was a fake. Ma's maid, Lu, was brought to the court and identified the defendants as the robbers who were at the scene. When questioned, the two robbers admitted the robbery without hesitation, but claimed that all the loot they had received had been lost in gambling dens that day. Judge Zhou then ordered the defendants to be taken back into custody and adjourned the hearing for fourteen days.</p>

<p>Resulting in Insufficient Evidence for a Guilty Verdict</p>
<p>Li Shangcun, a native of Suqian, 51 years old, and his wife, Li Zhang, run a beef shop at No. 202 Xinzha Bridge together. Li Daxin, a cousin's son, also works in the shop. Recently, Li Shangcun accused his nephew in the Special District Court of raping his aunt and requested legal action. Yesterday, Judge Ge opened the court for trial. According to Li Shangcun, he used to be a small patrolman for the Fourth Road Police Station. In November of the 18th year of the Republic [i.e. 1929], he suffered from hemiplegia due to a cold on night duty and retired. He opened a beef shop. On January 15th of this year, his illness worsened, and he was unable to get out of bed. On the night of the 18th, his wife, Zhang, was threatened by his nephew with a fake pistol, thrown to the floor, and forcibly raped. Later, in the morning, he used the same means to threaten Zhang to leave home and live at No. 14 next to the Chenjiabang small vegetable market. On the morning of January 24th, Li Mingshan, a mailman No. 123 at the Caojiadu Post Office, accompanied her to her brother's house in Shaoxing, where she stayed for fifteen days. Later, Li Shangcun received the news and went back with her. Li Daxin claimed to be 36 years old and said that the accusation of raping his aunt was completely false. He said that when the plaintiff opened the beef shop, he invested 200 yuan. Recently, the shop was sold last December for 380 yuan. Because of the capital relationship, he asked his uncle for the money and even asked his cousin, Li Mingshan, to intercede. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff intended to deny the debt and falsely accused him of rape to embezzle the money. Li Mingshan also stated that the debt collection had failed and that the matter of accompanying Li Zhang back to Shaoxing was completely fabricated. Judge Ge questioned the plaintiff repeatedly and pronounced the sentence that day, ruling that there was insufficient evidence and declaring the defendant not guilty.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Yesterday's Windstorm on the Huangpu River Causes Damage <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the south wind picked up considerably, and after 5:00 PM, the wind intensified. Dust and sand flew wildly on the streets, and many shop signs along the Huangpu River were blown off by the strong wind. Pedestrians were also hindered by the dust and sand. Cargo ships heavily laden in the Huangpu River were overturned by the strong winds and waves. One such ship was the Meng Tingsheng, which was carrying 200 barrels of tung oil and foreign and domestic goods to Huzhou for delivery. In the afternoon, it was moored at the south end of the Dalai Wharf in Pudong, waiting for the tide to set sail. Unexpectedly, at about 6:00 PM, when the wind was at its strongest, it capsized due to the heavy load and the strong waves. The crew members also fell into the water. Except for those who were rescued, the whereabouts of one crew member are unknown, and the losses are substantial. The consignees have hired ships to salvage the sunken ship and cargo. Another rice boat, the Wang Guangyu, from the interior, fully loaded with rice and stone, came to Shanghai to be sold by the rice merchant Wang. Yesterday afternoon, when it was sailing on the Longhua section of the South Huangpu River, it was hit by wind and waves, and all the rice in the boat was soaked with water. Two crew members were swept away by the wind. Wang, seeing this, immediately steered the rudder straight towards the shore and anchored, so it did not face danger. However, the loss was already considerable. Wang reported and prepared to hire a ship to transport the wet rice to Shanghai to be sold to sugar mills. The Chengfengyu Company's barge, Shen Asan, carrying sandalwood firewood, also lost a lot of cargo in the Rihui Port due to the wind and waves, and the oars and equipment on the ship were also blown off, but fortunately, the ship was unharmed. It is reported that the cargo is insured. Zhao Er'er, a wharf boatman, transported wheat and miscellaneous grains from Fengjing and other places to Shanghai. When it sailed near Longhua Mouth, it was suddenly hit by a hurricane and giant waves. Unable to withstand it, the ship tilted to one side, causing most of the wheat to spill into the Huangpu River. Fortunately, the whole ship did not capsize, and it quickly sailed to the shore to take temporary shelter. In addition, many instruments were washed away by the wind and waves. Therefore, the cargo ships moored in the Huangpu River hired ships to unload the cargo to lighten the load and avoid danger.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Statement from the Standing Committee of the Anti-Opium Association Regarding the Bai Case <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Believes It Is Entirely False Accusation</p>
<p>Huang Jiawei, the director-general of the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association, accompanied his wife, Ms. Bai Zhiying, to Taiwan to inspect the opium prohibition situation. During their absence from Shanghai, various Chinese and foreign newspapers suddenly reported that Ms. Bai Zhiying, Huang's wife, was found by Hong Kong Customs to be privately trafficking in morphine. Mr. and Mrs. Huang returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. It is understood that after this case occurred, the association held an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee and resolved to telegraph Director-General Huang to return to Shanghai immediately to clarify the truth. Now that Mr. and Mrs. Huang have returned, a special meeting was held yesterday, attended by Wang Jingqi, Li Denghui, Guo Baoyi, Shen Gao, and lawyer Cai Rudong, among other committee members. (1) First, Huang Jiawei reported on the trip to Taiwan. (2) Huang Jiawei reported on the truth of the false accusation. (3) Examined various evidence of false accusation. (4) The standing committee members considered that Mr. Huang's reasons for the false accusation and the evidence against it were sufficient and immediately resolved to issue the following statement on the Bai case. As reported earlier, the rumors of Ms. Bai Zhiying's trafficking in morphine, because Ms. Bai is the wife of Huang Jiawei, director-general of this association, have a special relationship with this association, so we paid close attention. At that time, because Mr. and Mrs. Huang were on official business in Taiwan, the rumors came suddenly, and without knowing the truth, it was not appropriate to express any opinion. We telegraphed Mr. Huang to return to Shanghai early to clarify the truth. Now that Mr. Huang and his wife have returned to Shanghai and reported everything to the special meeting of the Standing Committee of this association, and submitted many pieces of evidence, after detailed inquiries and various studies by the committee members of this association, we believe that the rumors of Ms. Bai's incident are groundless and hereby declare this. (5) Resolved to ask Director-General Huang to resume his duties immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Money Dealers Demand Separate Regulations for Native Banks <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Local Support</p>
<p>Since the Legislative Yuan passed the Banking Law No. 1, which subsumed native banks under it, the Native Banks Association has held meetings to discuss it, unanimously stating that banks and native banks are fundamentally different. The most obvious is that banks are limited organizations, while native banks are joint ventures with unlimited liability. Furthermore, there are differences in business, nature, and customs, and they have a long history. General commercial capital relies on native banks for loans to regulate it. If the native bank law is not enacted separately but is subsumed under the Banking Law, it will affect the entire commercial sector, and the consequences are unimaginable. Therefore, we have already submitted reports to various government agencies, requesting separate regulations for native banks to be followed, and sent letters to colleagues in various ports to jointly support our cause in order to achieve our goal. Details were recorded in the previous newspaper. It is now reported that various ports have responded, and the incoming letters are recorded below: (1) Letter from the Nanjing Native Banks Association: Respectfully, we received your letter and a draft submission. Our association believes that native banks and banks cannot be mentioned in the same breath. The Banking Law passed by the Legislative Yuan forcibly subsumes native banks under banks. All kinds of obstacles and difficulties are as stated in your letter. Investigating native banks and banks, there are many differences in their nature and customs. Native banks are operated by partners, while banks are limited organizations. The procedures for deposits and withdrawals are different. Furthermore, native banks have a long history and are widely established in towns and villages. The customs that have been followed are difficult to change at once. If we suddenly follow the banking regulations, it will inevitably affect the entire industry. Therefore, it is necessary to collect the opinions of the national financial community and properly formulate the native bank law to distinguish it from banks, so that it can be implemented and followed. Our association held a meeting and resolved to unanimously support your association's proposal and requested your association to strive hard to ensure that the native bank law is drafted as soon as possible for the public good. (2) Letter from the Kaifeng Native Banks Association in Henan: Respectfully, we received your letter and a draft submission. We respectfully acknowledge your association's enthusiasm for public welfare and the utmost intention to maintain the native banking industry. We should proceed together to achieve our goal. In addition to sending separate telegrams and making unanimous requests, we are enclosing a copy of the telegram draft for your review. (Enclosed telegram text: "To the Central Political Conference of the Chinese Kuomintang, the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, we have read the submission from the Shanghai Native Banks Association, stating that the regulations for native banks are important and that subsuming them under other laws would be difficult. We urge you to separately draft regulations for native banks to avoid being subsumed under the Banking Law to be followed. After the native banks read it, we express our agreement and unanimously urge your committee (government) (yuan) (departments) to review, approve the separate drafting of regulations for native banks, facilitate the implementation, and avoid difficulties, for the public good." etc.) In addition, there are also the Native Banks Associations of Hangzhou City, and the Native Banks Associations of "Changshu," "Pinghu," and "Nantong," among other counties, which have sent letters in response, calling for concerted efforts to strive to achieve the goal. The original texts and the above-mentioned intentions are mostly different in wording but the same in meaning, and are not recorded in detail.</p>

The Shaanxi disaster situation film is being printed to prepare for public screenings. Mr. Shen and others have gone south and agreed to arrive in Shanghai together in a week. At the same time, he also telegraphed Xu Jingren, Wang Yiting, Wu Zhihao, Huang Hanzhi, and Jin Guanfu, saying that Qinglan would wait for the cement for the construction and relief project to be shipped, and would come south in about a week. The Emergency Relief Association is requested to postpone the closing. Qinglan Jiang."</p>

<p>Will Go to the Capital to Report to the National Government on the Bandit Situation in Western Fujian</p>
<p>The Tingzhou Armed Self-Defense Corps of Fujian has been working hard to suppress the communist bandits in western Fujian in recent years and has been praised by the government. However, military supplies are scarce, and it has been unable to completely eliminate the communist bandits in western Fujian, which is a regrettable matter. Recently, Mr. Zhong Guanxun, the deputy commander of the corps, arrived in Shanghai today and is said to be going to the capital to report to the National Government on the recent bandit situation in western Fujian and request military supplies. Mr. Zhong is currently staying at the Xiangbin Hotel on Fourth Road.</p>

<p>The Jianglun collides: The Qinghe, an upper Yangtze ship of Jardine Matheson, and the Yibin, of Jiejiang Company, collided with each other downstream of Yichang. Both ships were damaged and stranded at the same time. Jardine Matheson has ordered its Hankou branch to send a ship to rescue them, while the Yibin of Jiejiang has been sent to the scene of the accident by an American gunboat after being hit. Because the two ships were damaged and stranded, bandits in the area sent boats to loot them. Fortunately, the American warship arrived in time, and they were not harmed. It is reported that the passengers on both ships have been rescued, so there were no injuries.</p>
<p>The Changjiang ship looting Kang Zhenji's manager: After the Changjiang ship ran aground in the sea between Wenzhou and Fuzhou, the French shipowner has been salvaging it and has sent workers to Beiyushan to carry out the salvage procedures. The Chinese Navy sent a warship to protect it. Unexpectedly, while salvaging the ship, several pirate ships suddenly came to loot it. The nearby warship saw it and opened fire. The pirates also returned fire. After about an hour, the bandits were defeated and fled. At present, the Changjiang ship is still being salvaged. It is said that it is hoped that the hull can be dragged out of the reef.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Petition from the National Goods Maintenance Association to Prevent Foreigners from Establishing Factories <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association submitted a document to the National Government, stating: "We have observed that since our country was forced under the walls of a city and the opening of the sea borders, various countries have wielded the unparalleled weapon of unequal treaties, exerting their utmost to implement economic aggression policies. They drain the marrow and blood of our people to cultivate their influence in China. In those times, those in power were unworthy, holding power upside down. All authorities only knew to consolidate favor and pursue personal gain, neglecting to intervene. This led to a continuous influx of foreign goods, increasing year after year. All kinds of items needed by our nation for clothing, food, housing, transportation, and daily use were usurped from domestic production and replaced by foreign goods. Eventually, our wealth was exhausted, the country weakened, and we fell into a semi-colonial status without realizing it, a truly lamentable situation. Fearing the peril of the nation and lamenting the demise of domestic products, our association gathered various industries, businesses, factories, and patriotic comrades in the year of Xinhai (one year before the founding of the Republic of China) to initiate and organize, with the aim of awakening the public, maintaining national goods, promoting industry, and expanding foreign sales. We also strived to advocate for the abolition of unequal treaties, the recovery of tariff autonomy, the recovery of extraterritorial rights, and the abolition of consular jurisdiction, among other major纲领, to save the nation. Since the unification of our National Government, adhering to the late Premier's instructions and after much arduous work, we have been able to gradually implement the above-mentioned matters and are approaching our goals. This is truly a good opportunity for our country to revive. However, at a time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and a狂潮 sweeps high, industrialists from various countries, seeing that our country has tariff autonomy and increased import taxes, have suddenly changed their tactics of economic aggression. Wielding their abundant capital, they are flocking to China to establish factories, using cheap Chinese labor and skilled techniques, hoping to avoid our country's increased tariffs and maximize the production of their goods, a vicious plan to夺國貨 and eliminate sales channels for national goods. Recently, the number of factories established in China by countries such as Britain and Japan has been increasing day by day and month by month. This is evidenced by the facts reported on March 22nd and 31st of this year, which already give a general idea of their intensified aggression. Given the current decline of domestic industry and commerce in our country, the消沉 of all industries, and the奄奄一息 of national goods, how can we resist this powerful enemy of new economic aggression? We, in our ignorance, believe that under these circumstances, our National Government should urgently establish special regulations for the registration and licensing of foreign factories in China, strictly restricting their establishment and levying重税 upon them. After approval, they should be constantly監　, preventing their aggressive actions to avoid倾轧 with our national goods, thereby rescuing the幼年期 of national goods. Our association, aware of this and feeling危, hereby submits this special电陈述貢獻蒭蕘, humbly requesting that the钧府院部 carefully examine and approve it, swiftly implement it, and await orders with utmost anxiety. We also respectfully request instructions for our compliance. Respectfully, Wang Jie'an, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, Standing Committee Members of the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association,叩首."</p>

<p>Shantou's Method of Resisting Foreign Ships: The French ship Da Guangdong, which sails to Nanyang from Shantou, experienced an incident where a French crew member beat a Chinese sailor to death, leading to major negotiations.

Sailors and workers in Shantou have implemented a boycott of French ships. Furthermore, British ships sailing between Shanghai and Shantou recently raised passenger fares due to the rising price of gold. Various circles in Shantou requested an exemption from the increase, but the shipping company did not agree. Passenger associations have proposed unanimously ceasing to travel on British ships and stopping loading their cargo.</p>

<p>Li and His Three Sons Are Not Guilty</p>
<p>His Wife Died of Illness in Prison</p>
<p>Li Zhang, the eldest daughter-in-law of Li Qingfu, a patrolman from Anhui Province with number 615 at the Third Head of the Gordon Road Patrol Station, died by hanging herself at home at 666 Gordon Road on the night of August 27th last year. The patrol station, based on a letter from someone stating that the deceased had been strangled to death by her parents-in-law and husband, detained Li, his wife Chen, his eldest son Li Yulong, and his second son Li Yukun and handed them over to the Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. Li Chen died of illness in the women's prison. Presiding Judge Wu repeatedly interrogated Li Qingfu and his three sons, but they all denied murder. In order to clarify the truth, Judge Wu personally went to the deceased's room to investigate. Recently, the辩論 ended, and the verdict was announced yesterday morning: Li Qingfu and his three sons are all not guilty. They had been detained for more than half a year and have now been released, which is a great stroke of luck within misfortune.</p>

<p>The Defendant Claims It Was a Wedding</p>
<p>Zhang Li, a woman from Nanhui, is 60 years old. She recently sued Zhu Alin, Zhu Akun, Zhu Asan, Chen Caigen, and others at the Special District Court for the crime of "robbing a bride" and obstructing freedom. Her statement of claim stated that her daughter, Zhang Xuezhen, was forcibly abducted by the defendants at the age of 19 to cohabit with Zhu Akun. Two months later, she took advantage of an opportunity to return home. This happened eight years ago. Since then, her reputation has been ruined, and she has not yet been married. In May of last year, Chen Caigen and others abducted her daughter again and imprisoned her privately. She earnestly requested legal action, etc. Yesterday, Judge Ge Zhitan opened the trial. Zhang Li供如上述. Zhu Asan stated that he lived at 384 Xintangjia Lane. Zhu Akun had a hearing impairment and was represented by him. He said that Zhang Xuezhen was currently in Nanhui and was very peaceful. When Xuezhen was five years old, she was already a 童养媳 in the Zhu family. At the age of twelve, she returned to her mother's home. At the age of nineteen, she was welcomed and married, and there were媒帖 as evidence. They cohabited for four years and had two daughters, both of whom died young. Last May, someone was sent to bring her back. Zhang Li's accusation of "robbing" etc. had no factual basis and was for other purposes, etc. Since Zhang Xuezhen had not arrived, the case was adjourned for further investigation and interrogation.</p>

<p>Wang Qian, a woman from Jingjiang, 44 years old, rented land at No. 230 Sanyuanfang, Yangshupu in this port. Her daughter-in-law, Zhang, was only 19 years old and worked at the Sanxing Yarn Factory. Because she lived far from the factory, it was inconvenient to have lunch, so she brought food to the home of Shi Renkui (i.e., Zhang's uncle) near the factory. However, Zhang suddenly disappeared on the evening of January 24th of this year and there was no news. Qian asked Shi about Zhang's whereabouts. Shi had no way and offered a reward of 20 yuan to ask someone to find her. The day before yesterday afternoon, someone secretly reported to Shi that Zhang had been seduced by Chen Baocai from Xuzhou and hidden in a 后平房 in Lan Nidu, Pudong. Shi obtained the clue and notified Qian to cross the river to Pudong and search at the address. He indeed caught Zhang's adulterer Chen Decai and reported to the police. They were detained and handed over to the third district of the Public Security Bureau. After the district chief inquired about the situation, he ordered them to be sent to the local court for disposal yesterday.</p>

However, his face was already rotten, suggesting he had been in the water for a long time. The corpse was wearing a white Western-style shirt, blue lined jacket and pants, white belt, wool socks, and rubber overshoes. There was a Zhongshan watch and a leather wallet in his pocket, containing only 18 copper coins. There were no other possessions.

<p>The Guyixuan Hunan and Sichuan Cuisine Restaurant, located west of the Great Stage on Sanma Road, has now been taken over by celebrities from all walks of life and reorganized.

It is heard that the restaurant has a special new initiative: within one month, it will sell代價劵. A book of eleven one-yuan coupons is only sold for ten yuan, and a book of eleven half-yuan coupons is only sold for five yuan, which can be described as廉之又廉.</p>

<p>To the Editor of Shenbao:</p>
<p>I am writing to you on behalf of my client, Hua Jiqiu. He brought a copy of your newspaper, stating that in the case of his concubine Zhou suing him, there was no mention in the court hearing the other day that the plaintiff's mother was his mother-in-law, nor did he personally go to Suzhou, nor did he have her family members押入侦探队, falsely accusing them of being bandits, and then being released after proving their innocence. The so-called侦探队 is a mistake for 缉队. Please issue a letter to correct this.</p>

<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>▲ The personality of a person is like the weather: lively and beautiful. Sanguine people are like spring: vigorous and passionate. Choleric people are like summer: desolate and bleak. Melancholic people are like autumn: restrained and cold. Phlegmatic people are like winter: rigid and cold. Heaven cannot be without the four seasons, and people cannot be without personality. Each of the four seasons has its own joy, and each personality has its own strengths.</p>
<p>▲ In angry rain and violent wind, birds are grieved. In bright breeze and clear sunshine, plants are delighted. It can be seen that heaven and earth cannot be without harmony for a day, and the human heart cannot be without joy for a day.</p>
<p>▲ Watching flowers half-bloomed and drinking wine slightly tipsy, there is great pleasure in this. If one reaches unrestrained drunkenness, it becomes an evil realm.</p>
<p>▲ Do not envy the wealth and honor of others; enjoy your own poverty and lowliness. Wealth and honor bring烦恼, while poverty and lowliness bring leisure. The true meaning of life lies here, not there.</p>
<p>▲ Vanity is the tomb of people, and children are the restraints of cattle and horses.</p>
<p>▲ Tobacco is named the "grass of longing." One cannot describe its taste but cannot help but long for it. Love can be called the "flower of anesthesia." One cannot describe its reason but cannot help but be anesthetized by it.</p>
<p>▲ Superstition is the element of success. Heroes become heroes, beauties become beauties, the wealthy become wealthy, and scholars become scholars all because of superstition. Therefore, there is a world because there is superstition; there is humanity because there is superstition; there is joy because there is superstition. If, one day, life is thoroughly understood and superstition is overthrown, then the end of the Earth will have arrived.</p>
<p>▲ The face is the public ledger of life; forehead wrinkles are like the final results that have already been announced. Alas, the people of the world are dreaming and do not know that old age is approaching.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Lihu Garden and Huishan Mountain Excursion Diary <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Fenlü</p>
<p>After visiting Plum Garden, a guest praised the beauty of Lihu Garden, so I went there very early on the fifteenth day to visit. The garden is located in Yangming Township, about fifteen or sixteen *li* from Wuxi city. I took a car instead of walking, and along the way saw mulberry trees and hemp fields. When I arrived at the gate, the morning dew had not yet dried. Light shade covered the willows by the *an*. Ancient trees surrounded broken pavilions, the scenery desolate. I exchanged a small amount of money for a ticket and entered. The garden occupies a corner of Tai Lake. A long corridor overlooks the water, and one can scoop up lake water by leaning over the railing. Inscriptions by Mi Xiangyang are embedded in the walls. I followed them and read until I forgot the distance. Passing a rockery, there was a patch of grass and three sailboats. Facing the lake is Jingxuan Tower. From there, one can watch light boats on the lake, entering and exiting the painted railings and willows, inspiring a broad and distant feeling in one’s heart that is not easily forgotten. Next to Jingxuan Tower is Lakeside Thatched Cottage, with exquisite bamboo blinds and a well-arranged layout. The plaque on the cottage was written by Qiu Changnian, his brushstrokes elegant and lively, perfectly matching the cottage. As for the name “Thatched Cottage,” there is Jiangshang Thatched Cottage in Bansong Garden in Shanghai, Jianshang Thatched Cottage in Suzhou, and Chishang Thatched Cottage in Wuxi Park. But in terms of occupying a secluded spot with undulating misty waters, Lakeside Cottage is the most outstanding. Turning west, one passes Little Peach Blossom Spring. The rock cave is deep and secluded. At first, one might think there was a hidden paradise. But the area draws water to form a pond and construct small pavilions, quickly revealing everything at a glance. The most wonderful thing is a lotus leaf made of cement in the center of the water, roughly the size of a round table. People can walk underneath it, truly creating the image of fish frolicking east of the lotus leaf and fish frolicking west of the lotus leaf. The surrounding rocks are inscribed with "Tiantian Island," a name that is exceptionally elegant and refined. As there were many visitors, I left. A few *wu* away from Lihu Garden is Lake Manor, where stones are being cut and clouds are being shaped, still awaiting completion. Earlier, Lü Ping, feeling tired, did not go to Lihu Garden and arranged to meet me later at the foot of Huiquan Mountain. When I arrived at Huishan Mountain, Ping had not yet arrived. I walked alone past “Separated from the Red Dust” and up to “Cloud Rising Pavilion,” gazing at the broken willows and grassy monument in Jichang Garden, as well as the Hometown Gentleman Shrine at the foot of the mountain, standing there in melancholy for a long time. On this excursion, although the landscape was beautiful, I couldn't escape my troubles. I remembered coming here last year when my old mother was still alive. Now, I climb Head Mao Peak alone, embracing the vast white clouds, thinking about where I belong and longing for the joy of someone pulling at my clothes and leaning against the door, never to be regained. I felt sorrow like the sea, and the misty waters of the Five Lakes were not enough to describe its depth. Before long, the mountains were darkening, and the desolate temple was shrouded in smoke. Lü Ping arrived, and we brewed tea together under Yilan Hall, tasting the second spring in the world, which left a lingering, sweet aftertaste like olives. Perhaps this trip was not in vain for Ping, who was burdened with worldly cares.</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Tale of a Loyal Dog Defending Against Thieves <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Zuichi Sheng</p>
<p>Some days ago, I went to a friend's house in Pudong for business and met a villager named Jia, who was talking eloquently about his beloved dog that died defending against thieves. I was moved by the dog's death, its dedication, and its fulfillment of its duty. Thus, I happily recorded the event. Jia lives in Zhangjialou. His family keeps several hunting dogs, all of whom are tame and understand human intentions. When they eat, they maintain order, each going to its own bowl and not interfering with others. Many village families raise chickens, often dozens. At night, chickens are often snatched and eaten by yellow wolves. Since Jia had his dogs on guard, he killed several wolves, and the wolves disappeared and dared not come out. One night, a thief climbed over the bamboo fence in the backyard, hoping to find something to steal. He was noticed by a dog named A Long, who barked madly at him and bit his foot. The thief, fearing he couldn't resist, jumped into a pond in the garden to avoid him. But the dog still didn't give up and also jumped in, fighting the thief to the death. The thief then took out a knife and stabbed the dog in the belly, but the thief also suffered a severe wound. Afterwards, the family heard the noise and got up to look. They saw a person covered in blood, crawling on the ground and moaning. Blood was flowing from his foot. They looked for A Long and found him floating in the water, which was turning red. They quickly pulled him out, but he was barely breathing and could not be saved. The next morning, they tied up the thief and sent him to the nearby security corps. They also chose a place to bury the dog and erected a monument next to the pond to commemorate him, writing in large characters: "On a certain day of a certain month in the Gengwu year, the loyal dog A Long died defending against thieves."</p>
<h3 id="e180">Memories of West Lake <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>West Lake's scenery is the most beautiful, but the embellishment of the landscape also relies on human effort. When I was magistrate of Hangzhou County, I once inscribed a chapter using Dongpo's words, "The Master of West Lake." During my tenure, I supervised the Lake Works Bureau, repairing famous scenic spots. The larger Yue Temple, Qian Shrine, and Yu Tomb were all completed during my tenure. Achieving things through people is the duty of an official, and there is nothing to praise. I just leave a few lines of writing for future generations to comment on. It's somewhat gratifying. What concerns me is the destruction of the fish-scale registers and the encroachment on public and private land. The beautiful West Lake is becoming fragmented. Forcible seizures and clever acquisitions cannot be restrained by law. Ancient sites are destroyed invisibly, and the lake itself is encroached upon over time. People do not hesitate to apply axes to ancient trees and sometimes dump waste into the drinking water. In a word, it's all for personal gain. When I judged lawsuits, I despised it in my heart. However, there are also people who are enthusiastic about public welfare. Wang Tiyu from Anhui is one of them. He built a garden at the foot of Nanping Mountain, and the construction was very beautiful. It contained many ancient artifacts, famous books, and paintings. He loved the *qin* and collected more than four hundred of them. He was a man of foresight. He once told me that he was willing to donate everything to Zhejiang Province for public ownership. This is truly rare. I quickly encouraged and supported him. He implemented it in 1926, formally submitting a petition to the county and then to the provincial government. The order was to commend him and instruct the county to consult with the gentry to discuss setting up a board of directors to manage the property. Before the matter was completed, I left office. It should be completed by now. This case originated in Wang's heart and was decided by Tao's hand. Not promoting it makes me feel like I have not fulfilled my duty. Recently, I saw in the newspaper that Wang's son had been kidnapped. The bandit case is a separate issue of social psychology. People often rejoice and rarely sympathize with wealthy people who have been captured by bandits. If this attitude is applied to Wang, it will frighten those who want to do good. This is saying something on behalf of West Lake. As for the construction of West Lake, it is wrong to think that it must rely on national funds. Read the West Lake Field Records. During the Ming Dynasty, Zhang, a eunuch, spent money, and the landscape was revitalized. Moreover, we are now in the Republic. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's six words, "of the people, by the people, for the people," are deeply rooted in people's hearts. How could there not be a second, even hundreds or thousands, of Wang Tiyus? The key is that good officials must guide and encourage them. Furthermore, there are too many ancestral halls and tombs in West Lake. Good mountains and waters are not used to plan entertainment methods for the living, but are occupied by the dead. This is a big mistake. Although it has been the custom for a long time, it should be corrected urgently. Moreover, since Su Xiao and Yue Fei's tombs have the phrase "heroes and heroines for thousands of years," ordinary people admire and imitate them, building tombs with fine workmanship and excellent stones, and inscribing tombstones. Seeing it makes me cringe, and thinking about it makes me angry. I think that a ban should be issued now, designating a scenic area along the lake and in the inner mountains for a certain number of *li*, prohibiting burials. Those who violate the law should be dismembered. This will prevent obstacles to future construction.</p>
<p>▲ Short News: Tuberculosis is a disease that is most difficult to cure. It has been repeatedly reported that people have expressed gratitude to the Yijin Herb of Peisheng Company on Zhonghua Road in Shanghai. Old cases of tuberculosis and coughing blood that have lasted for ten or twenty years have been cured by this herb and have not recurred. My old classmate, Mr. Wang, has suffered from this disease for fourteen years. Recently, I received a letter from him from Ningbo, saying that his illness suddenly worsened last autumn and he was on the verge of death. He also took this herb for forty days and recovered. Now his physique and spirit are getting stronger every day. It is heard that the Shanghai Siming Hospital has conducted practical research on this herb for two years and also believes that it is indeed a miraculous medicine for curing tuberculosis. I hereby issue a certificate to commend it. (Chen Ding)</p>
<p>▲ Publishing News: Zhou Jianyun, a senior figure in the literary world, recently edited a special issue for China's first sound film, "The Singing Girl Red Peony," amidst his busy schedule. Mr. Zhou has considerable friendships with many literary giants in Shanghai. Therefore, the works in this special issue are more than thirty in number, totaling more than one hundred pages, all of which are the best of the time. As for the exquisite printing, beautiful photos, and novel compilation, those are secondary matters. It is heard that it is scheduled to be published on April 1st and distributed by Huwei Trading Company on Renji Road. (Ziwei)</p>
<p>▲ Publishing News: Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing's newly published "Huo Sang Detective Case" has already become popular for a while.

The collection lists the masterpieces of Sherlock Holmes, Arsène Lupin, Sondike, and others. All detective masterpieces from England, America, France, Russia, Austria, and other countries have been collected, which can be said to be a great compilation of detective novels.</p>
<p>▲ Acknowledgement: The second issue of "The Crystallization of Beauty" has been published. Compared to the first issue, it is even more wonderful. The issue contains more than seventy photographs, all of which are masterpieces from the life of Mr. Dan Duyu. In addition, the inscriptions by Mr. Zheng Yimei are especially witty. Yesterday, the Beauty Society kindly presented me with a copy. Also, the "Linglong Magazine" published by Sanhe Company set a record for the small size of magazines and periodicals. It is published once a week. The writers are mostly famous ladies from Shanghai, such as Xue Jinyuan, who is especially renowned. Lin Zecang (hao Ganyun), Zhou Shixun, Chen Zhenling, and Lin Zemin jointly edited it. Yesterday, they kindly presented me with a copy each. I hereby acknowledge them.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Sleeping Pills Amidst Suicides <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Manyin</p>
<p>Every morning when we read the newspaper, the local social news that catches our eye the most is suicide news. This is not only true in prosperous Shanghai, but also in other places. There are various reasons for suicide, but most are economic, and a few are due to love. As for the method of suicide, taking medicine is the most common. In the past, people swallowed raw opium in the hope of ending their lives. Now, many people are taking an overdose of sleeping pills. This is especially true for young men and women in intellectual circles. They don't know where to buy opium, but there are pharmacies all over the city where they can buy sleeping pills. Also, the death from swallowing raw opium is quite tragic, while taking sleeping pills is like entering another world in a dream. It is now heard that the Executive Yuan of the National Government, in view of the increasing number of people committing suicide with sleeping pills, intends to devise methods to ban them. A citizen of Beiping, Men Jingyu, has also requested that the sale of sleeping pills be restricted as much as possible. The request has been forwarded by the Beiping Municipal Government. It is heard that the future methods of restriction will be: (1) Pharmacies will not be allowed to sell sleeping pills without a prescription signed by a responsible doctor. (2) When citizens purchase sleeping pills, their name, age, and detailed address should be investigated. (3) Each purchase should not exceed a single dose. It is said that the first article is a proper measure. As for the second article, those who intend to commit suicide may falsely report their name and address, making it impossible to investigate. Most of those who commit suicide in hotels now use fake names. As for the third article, it is a fundamental solution. However, they can still accumulate several doses and swallow them all at once. How can that be prevented? The Ministry of the Interior has ordered the Department of Health to properly draft measures to implement the ban. This is also a palliative measure. In short, if a person wants to die, everywhere becomes a path to death. In Shanghai, Zixia Paste is enough to destroy life, and the Huangpu River cannot be covered. Merely banning sleeping pills is not a fundamental solution.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 2nd, Indian monk Shide Nazhao came to discuss matters of the Asian Cultural Association. He said that the university president could join. Shi accompanied me to visit the Victoria and Albert Museum, opposite the park. From the Buddhist Association, it costs six copper coins by tram. Upon entering, there are stone lions and ox statues displayed on both sides. The lion's head is damaged, and the ox has heads on all four sides. This is the Indian style, often seen. There is an inscription indicating that it was made by King Ashoka, around 240 B.C., a great protector of Buddhism. The museum is divided into two floors. There are many minerals that are difficult to identify. There are many small coral trees. There is a pair of large animal teeth, 84 English feet long. There is an Egyptian mummy, preserved with medicine and turned into a fossil, remaining intact to this day. It is from four thousand years ago. The patterns of the clothing still exist, but the face has become skeletal. Today, with the advancement of chemistry, this old method is no longer used. The most fascinating things are ancient steles, ancient bricks, ancient Buddha statues, and various Indian religious statues, which are very abundant. Those who want to study Indian history, culture, religion, art, and customs must study here. There are more than a hundred kinds of Indian writing, which we cannot recognize. There are also various kinds of Indian religious carvings, sculptures, and burnings. The materials are copper, iron, stone, brick, pottery, and soil of various colors. What is easy to see is that the statues are mostly unclothed. Even the Buddha statues are not covered in even an inch of silk. Also, the female statues have thin waists and very large breasts, similar to the style of Western women today. It can be seen that today's Western customs originated in India.</p>
<p>Items collected here come from various places. There are many from Nepal. There are many types of Tibetan Buddha statues. Those from Burma and various provinces of this country. There are many missing heads and feet. The small ones can be an inch in diameter, while the large ones are as tall as a person, either sitting or standing. If there are specialized Buddhists and those who can compare and study the traces of their changes with India, then there will definitely be great discoveries. I have seen various Buddha statues of Japanese Esoteric Buddhism. I also saw the Dunhuang Grottoes Thousand Buddha Paintings printed by the British at Yangon University, all in five colors, shining brightly. China cannot dream of it. When rituals are lost, seek them in the wild. Learn from the four barbarians. The quintessence of the nation also falls behind foreigners. This is a great shame.</p>
<p>The museum contains agricultural, cotton, silk, and porcelain items, but no machines. It can be seen that Indian machine science is not developed. There are many universities in various provinces of India, with thousands of students. The market is full of English writings by Indians in bookstores, far exceeding China. But they do not know how to learn machines, so they cannot compete with the British.</p>
<p>There is a Burmese throne, which is said to have been moved here after the destruction of the last kingdom. It is quite gorgeous.</p>
<p>The Victoria Queen statue in the west building facing east is made of marble and was completed in 1877. It was commemorated in the name of the Indian people. In the statue, the left hand holds a wreath, and the right hand holds a short baton, about a foot long. The goddess is graceful and elegant. It is the queen who annexed the entire India. I asked the Indians. The British map of India began with the East India Trading Company in the sixteenth century, gradually encroaching and annexing the entire India. It has been nearly a hundred years. The absorption of various provinces varies from early to late, some for two hundred years, some for one hundred and forty years, until today. Indians are beginning to awaken greatly and resist to the end.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Securities Market Situation for Bonds During the Four Days of This Week <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Prices Extremely Stagnant, with Fluctuations Compared to the Previous Week</p>
<p>Transaction Volume Only About 18 Million Yuan</p>
<p>During this week, the trading situation on the Shanghai Stock Exchange was as follows: Monday was for handling March futures settlements, and the weekend was for the Qingming holiday, so trading was suspended. Therefore, there were only four trading days in the entire week, and the daily trading was sparse. Buying and selling in the market was extremely quiet. The total spot trading for the entire week was 28,000 yuan, and the futures trading was only 27,925,000 yuan, less than the previous week's 23,450,000 yuan. Among them, the 20-year cigarette bond accounted for 4,735,000 yuan, the troop reduction bond 4,100,500 yuan, the 19 Customs bond 3,115,000 yuan, the 19 Disaster Relief bond 2,200,000 yuan, and the troop reduction and reorganization bond 1,955,000 yuan. The 96 Consolidation 6 Customs bond and other bonds were only 560,000 yuan. The others were only several thousand yuan. As for the changes, due to the lack of slight changes in the surrounding environment, coupled with the recent settlement and the approaching Qingming holiday, large buyers and sellers rarely entered or exited the market, resulting in a balanced supply and demand situation. Bond prices became increasingly stagnant, and the daily fluctuations were minimal, which was rare. According to statistics, the fluctuations in bond prices for the entire week were only around 67 cents, with the increases and decreases compared to the previous week only around 50 cents. The situation in the bond market has not yet escaped the stable state. The statistics of the highs, lows, and fluctuations of various bond prices in the past four days are listed in the following table (unit: yuan. The spot prices of troop reduction and reorganization, 19 Cigarettes, 19 Customs, and 20-year Cigarettes, etc., are calculated without March interest after Wednesday.)</p>

<h3 id="e185">Yarn and Cotton: Excellent Condition for Current Yarn <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Transaction Somewhat Sparse Due to Spring Holiday</p>
<p>The yarn market is still firm, and the condition of current yarn is good. The trend for fine yarn is getting firmer, but the number of people gathering in the market is very sparse. Speculators believe that during the spring holiday, the condition of standard futures yarn and overseas cotton yarn is uniformly inactive. The Guangbang agents are the most vigorous for current yarn and have a developing outlook, so the market sentiment is better. Large traders have high hopes and no intention of easing up. 300 bales of current yarn were traded in the morning, and there was no market in the afternoon. Among the out-of-town buyers, Guangdong bought 150 bales, Xuzhou bought 10 bales, Shantou 80 bales, Tianjin 5 bales, fellow traders 20 bales, and Qingdao 70 bales. The market prices rose slightly, and fine yarn rose between one and two taels.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Grain: Price of Customer Sen Lower, Sales Moving <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Ningbo, Guangdong, and Hoarders All Inquiring</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer *sen* market remained weak. The Jiangxi agents, due to the weather getting warmer, could no longer hold on and were willing to reduce prices to sell. The customer agents had no way out for a long time and took advantage of this price weakness to conduct some trial transactions. If they could sell successfully, there would be progress in the future. The unified market sold 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine late goods by various agents going to Jiangxi, priced at 11.35 yuan to 11.10 yuan. Also, 600 bags of *mo* early goods were priced at 9.20 yuan to 9.00 yuan, bought by the Ningbo agent, Guangdong agent, and hoarders. The Guangdong agent also handled 608 bags of Jiangxi machine *yuan* by Zhongguan, priced at 11.50 yuan. After this batch is sold, if there are more sales in the future, the market price will definitely rebound.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Starch Market Gradually Declining <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>In the morning after the opening of the market for daily starch, prices for each month have dropped one after another, and the nearby and distant categories have returned to about 0.02. The reason for this is that despite the continuous price increases in the market, there have been no actual sales, and the goods that factories and merchants have ordered have not yet arrived. (Boat not arrived). Because there is more than enough remaining balance, they can take advantage of this high price to sell and set prices. The theory of the foreign wheat ban does not have to do with the current suspension of orders. The new wheat is growing very well, and inland gangs continue to sell. Therefore, the market price of each month has seen a gradual decline. Although there was a slight replenishment of short positions before the close of the market in the afternoon, the prices were still about 0.025 lower compared to the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Wheat Market Plunges After Rising Sharply <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market yesterday, all months saw an improvement due to the previous day's increase. Subsequently, merchants who had ordered foreign wheat sold it off, and inland gangs continued to sell it off, and there was a renewed determination in thought of selling shorts, and it was followed by sales, and the market prices for all months fell sharply and uniformly. The new wheat standards for the months of June and below were because the scheduled arrival period for the previously ordered foreign wheat coincided with the time when the new wheat entered the market, and the short side was even more selling off. The market prices were even smaller than the recent ones. The closing prices were 0.05 less for July, 0.04 less for August and September, and 0.02 or 0.03 less for April and May.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Piece Goods, Wool Fabrics, and Woolen Cloth All Dropping Cheaply <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Piece goods and woolen fabrics have been selling well recently. Buyers from the home country have been buying one after another, and retail and wholesale transactions have been quite lively. However, their selling prices are falling daily. Broadcloth, wate, and most of the others have generally depreciated. Most buyers want to lower prices, which is why the inventory is flooding the market and supply exceeds demand. Huaji, Deji, Yaniyong, and colored wate cloth were all selling for 4.95 to 5.1 taels per week, but yesterday they were selling for 4.7 to 4.8 taels. Lihe and Rongtai iridescent wate cloth were selling for 4.175 taels. Old Sassoon Yuanchang blue-gray broadcloth was selling for 2.725 taels, which was 0.07 or 0.08 cheaper than the previous day.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Daily Sugar Trading Still Smooth</p>
<p>Taiyuan Ice Arrived in Over a Hundred Boxes</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were still no telegrams from the sugar production areas. The Guild Market's planned price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sugar was 10.03 taels, but the buying interest was particularly quiet. Sellers still wanted to struggle, leading to a stalemate. The market shape was still firm. No. 20 medium white sugar was 9.65 taels. Huaxin goods had some transactions, and the market was still stable. Japanese sugar YP mark had a transaction price of 10.03 taels, and the trading was still frequent. Others, such as J mark at 10.04 taels, YRO mark at 9.65 taels, TM mark at 9.8 taels, and YT mark at 10.015 taels, had less demand and were taking advantage of the trend to be flat and weak. The Taiyuan City break was for a long time. Yesterday, 108 boxes arrived. The original plate was numbered, but there was a quiet hand, the market was particularly flat and not odd.</p>
<h3 id="e190">North-South Goods: Price of Southern Gorgon Fruit Rising Daily <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Southern Pond Gorgon Fruit: Lately, there have been shortages. It has been found that a certain party accumulated a batch last winter. Therefore, since the beginning of spring, market prices have been increasing in color. Currently, the bottom of the inventory is gradually thinning, and the price is increasing. Yesterday, the market was sold at 135 yuan, or may increase again.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than ten boxes of orchid seeds arrived. The goods are quite high and low. The upper villages did not open because the prices did not match. The next village does not exceed 40 taels, and soft ones are around 37 taels, but the numbers are not many.</p>

<p>— Lin</p>
<p>(IV) This Freedom</p>
<p>After the rainbow, there is freedom. This is the cry of twentieth-century women. Historically speaking, female independence is a very new thing. How can it not be surprising? Although the exact date is hard to recall, it hasn't been long since women cast their first votes. Twenty years ago, you would never hear of a young woman going to New York alone to find a position and struggle with fate. Now, thousands of young women go to New York every year.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of this freedom? What does it encompass? It means making your own decisions, and there is no room for recriminations, no matter what the outcome. It means living alone, or with other women of the same generation, but not like a female dormitory supervisor in an old school. It means often supporting oneself. It means choosing to study what interests you, and if you enjoy watching plays, you can go out for a walk alone at midnight. In short, it is truly like the independence of a married woman without the heavy responsibilities.</p>
<p>Many parents are very unwilling to have their daughters live alone in New York City. Parents really don't understand that in today's world, there is an unwritten saying called "Youth Reigns." The old ways have changed. Young people today all want to try their wings and find their own way. Parents who oppose this argument stand on losing ground.</p>
<p>Professional women in New York who do not live with their families have complete freedom. First, their professions will never interfere with their social lives. In small cities, colleagues are very clear about each other's private actions. In New York City, because of the large area and population, professional women can disappear as soon as they leave the office. What she does is all her own business until she goes to work the next morning.</p>
<p>Living in New York City, neighbors mostly do not communicate with each other. Therefore, some people live in co-op apartments for several years without knowing the other residents. The shackles of social interaction are completely gone. Professional women do not need to worry about the surveillance of neighbors. She can think and do as she pleases. For truly powerful women, this is truly a glory. An individual's honest and self-confident behavior does not need to be interfered with by outdated traditions. Women who lack extremely valuable character and happiness are a little worse off. They cannot distinguish true value, and sometimes they are deceived by beauty and desire, and suffer pain. Parents raise their daughters and think about them, knowing under what circumstances they can find victory. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e193">Sandalwood Beads <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Su Jun</p>
<p>Because I was suffering too much from neurasthenia, I came to live in West Lake on the advice of friends. Almost another week has passed. Unaccustomed to solitude and silence, I am hiding in a small house next to the cemetery of a revolutionary martyr on the shore of the lake. Loneliness occupies my surroundings. Except for seeing a doctor twice and taking a walk on Su Causeway in the evening, I live in such a large, quiet space. To be honest, my nerves are constantly suffering, because lonely shouting is a kind of suicide.</p>
<p>In the evening, I went to mail letters to friends and took a walk. On the road, I suddenly remembered Uncle Six's instructions to bring him a string of sandalwood beads. So I entered Yue Wang Temple. There were many stalls selling sandalwood beads and other items at the entrance of the temple, but I walked inside, under that big tree. I went to a stall selling sandalwood beads to pick and choose.</p>
<p>The seller of sandalwood beads was a girl. In her cheeks, her chest, the vague outline of her waist, and even the posture of her round hands and delicate feet, she was a mature girl, and she had considerable beauty, but it was simple and carried a slight seductive undertone. This was revealed in her smile and in the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>"These fragrances," she said, handing me many strings of beads, but her small, clever eyes were looking into space—she was not looking at any object.</p>
<p>"Oh," I smelled them, my nose close to her hand. She retracted her hand. I said, "Yes, but it's not as fragrant as your hand."</p>
<p>She was shocked by the customer's teasing. She turned her face and smiled. I also smiled.</p>
<p>I took a string and asked her,</p>
<p>"How much does it cost?"</p>
<p>"Six jiao."</p>
<p>"Six jiao?" I raised my eyebrows and stroked the sandalwood beads. Then I started to bargain with her. "It should be cheaper."</p>
<p>"What do you say?" She lowered the price for the customer.</p>
<p>"Four jiao, maybe," I said, "but I'm worried, I'm afraid these beads will become less fragrant."</p>
<p>"No way," she said, "You put them in your pocket, you put them on your arm, you gently stroke them, they won't be less fragrant."</p>
<p>"Yes, they will," I said stubbornly, "These beads, after I buy them, they will definitely be less fragrant."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, sighing, "When they are with you, you will sprinkle the fragrant powder you put on your face on them, or they can be stained with the fragrance on your hands and the sweat mixed with fragrant powder dripping from your face at any time. However, they will be unfortunate because after I buy them..."</p>
<p>"Oh," she smiled, "You are so humorous."</p>
<p>"It's not a joke," I said, "I still won't buy them, right? If they really become less fragrant, then I will definitely abandon them. Oh, wouldn't that be too unfortunate?"</p>
<p>…" She laughed. She couldn't understand because I talked too much. Indeed, what I said later was not teasing, but truly a sense of sadness.</p>
<p>"I'll sell them to you for four jiao," she said, "They won't be less fragrant as long as you don't let them be exposed to wind and rain, and you play with them carefully. They will be fragrant for a long time."</p>
<p>"Oh," I said with a smile, "Just like your hands are tender for a long time, and your smile remains for a long time. The beads will also be fragrant for a long time."</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, "as long as you play with them carefully..."</p>
<p>She suddenly turned her head, silently stroking the sandalwood beads with her hands in place and space.</p>
<p>I left four jiao on the stall, on top of the sandalwood beads. I stroked a string of sandalwood beads and quietly walked away.</p>
<p>A funny sigh slipped out of my heart.</p>

<p>— Zhan Bi</p>
<p>It has been several dozen days into the twentieth year of the Republic of China. Many schools in this city are busy with the start of school. My two younger sisters are also busy moving into the school.</p>
<p>The two of them live in the front building, and I live alone in the pavilion room. I got up this morning and went to the front building to wash my face. Younger Sister Ying and Younger Sister Zhen were discussing giving up the house. I said, "There is no point in discussing anything, once this front building is given up." Younger Sister Ying said with a smile,</p>
<p>"Do you understand the rules of Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"How can I not understand?"</p>
<p>"He is an old Shanghainese, of course he will understand,"</p>
<p>Younger Sister Zhen said with a sneer. Younger Sister Ying continued,</p>
<p>"Now it is the twelfth month of the lunar calendar. The landlord is a feudal-minded person. He wants to celebrate the lunar New Year. He will not allow us to give up the house in the two months surrounding the New Year, December and January. If you go to give up the house, I don't see how you can succeed. So I am discussing it with my sister."</p>
<p>"Oh, you can't give it up? How can you not give it up? Watch me, I'll go give it up. In the end, we men can give it up. As for you women, I'm afraid it won't be very successful."</p>
<p>Younger Sister Zhen just smiled. Younger Sister Ying said angrily,</p>
<p>"I'll see you go and give it up. If you can give it up, then I'll say you men have more insight. If you can't give it up, then when you come back late tonight, I will definitely not let you in and make you stand in that open-air dam all night to punish you for the sin of being a chatterbox."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay," I said with a sigh and a laugh as I walked downstairs to find the landlord.</p>
<p>There were originally many landlords. There were more than ten people in their family. However, the person in charge was an old lady, an old lady in her fifties. This old lady was very amiable and kind. A kind of approachable and admirable smile often appeared on her face. We have lived here for four months since we came to Shanghai this time. She has talked with our three sisters almost every day. She always asks about our daily life, food, clothing, and shelter, and she is very concerned. One day, Younger Sister Ying was wearing thinner clothes. She touched her body and pinched her shoulders, saying with great concern,</p>
<p>"Oh, sister, you quickly put on more clothes. The weather is very cold. If you get cold, it's not good. If you get sick, it's really worrying."</p>
<p>Another day, she saw that Younger Sister Zhen hadn't gotten out of bed. She sat on the edge of the bed and touched Younger Sister Zhen's head with her hand. She said anxiously,</p>
<p>"Oh, her forehead is burning badly. Mr. Zhan, quickly invite a doctor to feel her pulse. It's best to take medicine quickly."</p>
<p>"My brother is not at home. He went to Wusong this morning,"</p>
<p>Younger Sister Ying replied to her. She immediately left the edge of the bed, walking and saying,</p>
<p>"I'll help you invite a doctor. The doctor diagonally opposite Yadao Gate is a female doctor and is very good. I'll help you invite her."</p>
<p>She treats us with care just like a loving mother. Just now, my younger sisters said they were discussing the issue of giving up the house, probably because of the old lady's loving and amiable feelings that the discussion arose.</p>
<p>As soon as I walked into her room, she saw me.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhan, you got up very early,"</p>
<p>"It's not early, it's nine o'clock. I really like to sleep late,"</p>
<p>"Early, very early. It's cold. There are many people in Shanghai who don't get up until twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>"Old lady, we want to give up the house. We're not living in the front building anymore."</p>
<p>"Oh, give up the house, good, good. Where are you moving to? Why only give up the front building?"</p>
<p>"My younger sisters are going to school. They will be moving into the school the day after tomorrow. I will still be living here."</p>
<p>"Go to school, that's good."</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry to you. We shouldn't be giving up the house in December of the lunar calendar."</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Zhan, please don't say that. Two girls are going to school. It doesn't matter if you give up the house in December of the lunar calendar. Anyway, we ourselves are short of houses to live in. You see, my grandson, he just came from the north. He doesn't have a house to put his bed in now. You see, he's sleeping on the table."</p>
