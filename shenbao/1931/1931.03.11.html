<p>▲國民社九日柏林電　德國國會今日開始辯論海陸軍之預算、國防部長格羅納將軍之演說、極引人注意、格氏謂極右派及極左派雖猛施攻擊、而彼對於原定計劃、未嘗絲毫變更、格氏繼乃駁斥法國陸軍部長麥金諾近今所發之言論、蓋麥氏曾言各國軍備决不能平等、凡在歐戰中被攻之國、應許其較挑戰國多享便利云云、格氏謂凡爾賽所稱德爲惟一戎首之言、國際史學家皆絶對否認、故今己不能成立、但全世界之史學家如秉公判决該問題、則德國殊願接受其讞詞、至凡爾賽條約所以以軍縮條欵加諸德、而德國無異言者、非自認戎首願受懲戒也、蓋欲以身作則、開世界軍縮之先河耳、今德國己履行凡爾賽之條欵矣、其縮减軍備之程度、舉世無匹、故今日德國實有權要求世界其餘各國同樣縮减軍備、使世界各國皆有同等之安寗、德國此種要求、一爲根據其應有之權利、一爲世界和平及歐洲善後計、蓋此二端、實爲當今急不容緩之要圖也、格氏繼又枰擊法國陸軍部長麥金諾所作法國己開始縮减軍備之宣言、謂法國師團之數確己减少、軍役年限雖己縮短、然實力並未减少、僅在編制上略加更動而己、且其戰鬭力反較前見增、格氏末又評詆麥金諾關於德國軍備之統計、謂麥氏將警察及稅關人員一併列入軍隊、實則此種人員與德國之軍備及國防毫無關係、各國無一將此列入軍隊也云云、</p>

<p>中央黨部九日紀念週、由于右任報告「國民會議與約法」、其詞如下、國民會議之召集、係本總理遺囑的意思、在　開會日期迫近的時候、本黨的同志、應當十分的努力、以促其成功、回想總理從廣州北上及在北京逝世時、其艱難困頓之情形、及其希望召集國民會議之熱誠、至今尤在心目、總理北上時、曾發表北上宣言、對召集國民會議之目的有兩點、（一）對内謀國家之和平統一、以解决民生問題、（二）對外　除不平等條約以提高國際地位、並說明國民會議　集之意義、在革命武力與人民之結合、昔之所謂革命武力、係指當時革命軍事未能統一全國而言、就現在的情形來說、則爲謀政府與人民之結合、其結合的功用、一·就政府本身說、在謀一切工作的發展、以適應國民之需要、蓋必如是、然後工作發展之利益歸於國民、二·從人民方面說、在使國民能自選擇其需要、蓋必如是、然後國民之需要、乃得充分表現、現在召集國民會議、就是要實現這重要的意思、</p>
<p>上週戴委員報告「國民會議之任務、一爲全國人民在法律上明白接受三民主義、一爲全國人民在法律上明白的承認建設民國應按建國大綱」並聲明「政府與人民之間、應有一種公約」、現在全國業經和平統一、訓政之時、爲　通政府與人民間之意志、而召集國民會議、則政府與人民間之關係、在法律上應有之規定、確爲會議中最要之任務、上星期中央臨時常會、通過設立約法起、草委員會、可知中央對於需要約法、具有决心、今日下午即開第一次約法起草會議、因爲本黨同志、或許有不明瞭的地方、所以再把這個問題、向大家詳細的說明、</p>
<p>就本黨　史而言、由興中會而同　會、由同盟會而中華革命黨、由中華　命黨而中國國民黨、興中會爲草創時期、同盟會與中華革命黨、爲　　時期、中國國民黨爲成熟時期、在　種時期、同盟會的時候、總理己確立他的偉大主張、如三民主義五權憲法及建國三時期皆一一明白宣布、其時帝國主義東侵、中國人民正當昏睡、總理能内察國情、外審大勢、創造三民主義五權憲法建國三時期、不特是中國很大的事情、也是世界上值得紀念的大事、但是人人都知道三民主義五權憲法、是總理所獨創、而對於建國三時期、多所忽略以爲這是一件很平常的事體、其實這也是很不容易發明、在中國古時、有據亂昇平太平世之分這是見於公羊疏上的、又如在禮運上有所謂大同小康時期之分、我們讀書時、往往滑口讀過、忽略古代聖傑、創造精意之所在、總理在前多年的時候、爲劉成禺同志作　太平天國戰史叙文裏、也有分革命程序之說明、「一曰軍政時期、主權在軍府、對人民行頒定之約、二日訓政時期、主權在政府、與人民立共同議定之約、三日憲政時期、主權　諸人民、組織完全憲法之國家」、並太息於洪秀全之亡、謂爲未諳軍政憲政之旨、致使曾國藩奏成滿清中興之蹟、俄國革命、有所謂新經濟政策的時期、共産黨人咸佩服列寗眼光之銳敏、實不知其受中國同盟會四綱之影響也、可以說接受總理對於本黨同志所指示的方略、我一再引證中外古今、證明建國三時期之重要者、在使本黨同志、能深切瞭解遺囑上所謂「余致力國民革命凡四十年」此四十年中總理之革命精神完全一貫、其大致主張、從未稍有更易、順之則治、反之則亂有必然者、故進一步言之、自同盟會以迄今日、總理之主張、在革命進程中均有拘束之力、</p>
<p>自北伐成功後、國民會議與約法之聲即起、中央亦曾數次討論、至二届五中全會後、其聲寂然、去年大戰之後、國民會議與約法之聲、由人民及中央又爲提起、至三届四中全會後、聲亦寂然總理所分建國三時期、在同盟會爲軍政約法憲政、在革命方略爲軍政訓政志政、改　約法爲訓政、並非變更約法的主張、因爲　　二字、範　較廣可以包括一切、故總理並聲明「在訓政時期中、施行約法」云云、括弧内注明、「非現行者」四字、並痛切說明、指民元不能依其革命程序之主張的錯誤、蓋民元的約法、其重大之誤謬、在　法者不必盡爲瞭解革命主義之人、故所訂之約法與革命的主義、截爲兩事、與本黨及民衆所要求者相　太遠甚至與制法者之本身、亦毫無關係、此種離開　命離開民衆離開本身之約法、非落伍即係超越時代、所以成爲中華民國之一　物、十三年總理制定建國大綱宣言、論民元約法、未經軍政訓政兩時期、故不能發生實行上之效力、並非根本否認建國程序中約法主張、其意義一爲不經軍政時期、則反革命的勢力不能掃除、使武人有憑　約法爲惡之危險、一爲不經訓政時期、則人民驟然解放、不能瞭解約法與本身關係之眞諦、蓋指民元旣未脫離軍事時期、又未能訓政而言、現在軍事敉平、訓政己獲相當成效、正本黨扶植民治之時、與從前情勢己不可同日而語、旣無反側者利用之可危、亦無放棄責任之積習、是起草約法、謀人民與政府之協作、正其時也、前兩年有幾位不明白革命主義的學者、抱人權論之說、大談約法、不知總理所謂約法中之民權、係革命民權、與彼等所拾宗教家及過去政治家之民權學說、完全不同、今日說明此意、希望大家對於約法問題、深切研究、以供獻於中央、以固和平統一之基、而收長治久安之效、</p>

<p>▲爪哇地方。只有士人可以自有地産。歐人只能向他們租借。以七十五年爲期。并須以一半的地供給士人免費種米。</p>
<p>▲美國新設立一所婚姻學堂。凡是未婚的男女。都可入内讀書。創辦人是一位女士。據伊說。婚姻之斯以得不到幸福。其百分之九十都爲的夫婦不能互相諒解所致。</p>
<p>▲倫敦有一個魚市。名弼林斯甘。billingsgate凡是一切魚的買賣。都在這裏成交。此市成立以來。己有一千年。</p>

<h3>紀枉死之二女子</h3>
<p>— 絜廬</p>
<p>天下枉死之人甚多。凡時疫急症皆有可生之道。徒以國人衞生之不知注意。與醫藥智識之缺乏。每年死於非命者不知若干人。西人某氏嘗撰「眞死與假死」論文。舉例頗富。略謂棺中往往發現爪痕。及骨骼凌亂之現象。此即假死後復活之明徴。故死後非經二十四小時而殮。往往難免活埋之慘。此非理想之談。事實上蓋甚多也。以予所聞。則二女子明明枉死。紀之以供前車之鑑也。</p>
<p>隣舍俞氏婦。甚賢慧。得翁姑懽。其夫經商漢臯。以懷孕還鄉居焉、婦夙患痔疾、發時痛苦殊甚。有告以冰片和蜂蜜。塗肛眼。立愈、婦如法塗之。不料嬰孩難受冰片之氣味。突然上竄。婦遂死。其夫聞耗還家。撫棺痛哭不欲生。見者爲之墮涙。此豈非無醫藥智識而致枉死者耶。濫用虎狼藥者。其知所戒焉。</p>
<p>前日街頭有女子名阿英者。年二十有三早餐後猶在河中浣衣。薄暮。以腹痛而死。予聞談者言。詢以有無它疾。答謂自晨至晚。唯腹痛而己。予恐吾邑亦發現時疫。不願往視。厥後詳爲偵察。始知阿英乃奉化人。寄寓吾鄉。以其夫如三寸丁穀樹皮第二。故面首甚多。先一夕。與某甲野合於破廟地上。爲人所見遁去。予始悟此必夾阾傷寒而致命者。惜當時未悉其眞相。而阿英之夫又蠢如鹿豕。隣人咸辟之若凂。於是枉死城中又添一風流鬼焉。予以目擊二事、衋焉傷心。不揣謭陋。爰走筆紀之如上云。</p>
<h3>傷心之言</h3>
<p>— 某</p>
<p>葉澄衷先生裔孫仲方君。聰明頴異。而豪放不覊。以小抖亂名於海上。近日不知受何重大剌激。棄家他去。臨行曾有一函致其所眷雪莉云。「今如君願。背家出走。前途茫茫。不知所届。廻憶去年今日之風光。詎料有今年此刻之惆悵。仲雖有心。奈君不顧何。仲今去矣。望君珍重。」不意此君。亦爲情累。讀其函。雖只寥寥數語。而傷心己極。不知彼雪莉見之。亦有動於中乎。</p>
<h3>各大學參觀麥迪孫總統號記</h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>美國大來輪船公司。近推廣營業。並聨絡國人情感起見。特於本月六日。由靑年會代邀各大學學生赴麥迪蓀總統號參觀。到各大學教授學生百五十一人。自下午二時出發五時始返。其間頗多可紀。爰爲述一二如次。</p>
<p>▲新關碼頭空氣緊張　當該公司最初邀請各大學學生時。原不限於畢業班。厥後加入者異常踴躍。就交通大學而論。己有百五十人。嗣公司感於人數過多。决計分期招待。先儘大學四年級同學。蓋若輩畢業在即。出洋問題。亦較爲關心也。一時許。新關碼頭己滿佈候補學士。十分之九皆着西裝。笑語歡騰。空氣漸形緊張。</p>
<p>▲搭客輪渡座無隙地　該公司請柬中。言明一時五十分會齊。比至五十分。果見大來公司接客小輪。緩緩駛來。可謂信守時刻者矣。該輪地位甚巨。惟乘客過多。上下均無隙地。公司中人相告語曰。如此擁擠。打破空前紀錄矣。客旣登輪。隨即啓椗。適是時大夏大學十數人乘汽車至。急奔埠頭。然己無及。無不面現懊喪之色云。</p>
<p>▲歡迎嘉賓任意游覽　抵浦東後。麥迪孫總統號己在目前。由公司職員肅客登輪。至休息室稍憇。該輪佈置之富麗。不啻上海之一等旅社。而清潔嚴肅。則又過之。入室後。每人分發紙片一。囑書姓名學校。然後置之衣襟。藉資識别。輪内各部。悉行開放。甚至游客止步之賀駛間。亦得導入。並由一機師加以解釋。</p>
<p>▲赴美川資二千餘元　該輪面積極巨。内分宿室。舞廳。餐室。寫信室。交誼室等。無不窮極富麗、焕若神居。頭等房間。中設榻二。其他應用物件。應有盡有。詢其至美價格。謂須美金四百八十餘。合華幣計之當在二千元以上也。</p>
<p>▲茶點招待滿室生春　四時。船員請各參觀者至餐室茶叙。雖人數甚多。然以餐廳頗巨。尚不過擠。每桌六人。西點及吐司二盆。食完復益。招待可謂週到、餐後羣取交誼室。由靑年會代表西人海慕華氏致詞。謂彼亦係一中國留學生。蓋彼産於蘇州。稍長赴美就學。學成又歸中國云。繼復申謝公司之殷勤招待。講時偶雜蘇語。聽者絶倒。</p>
<p>▲分贈書册珍重惜别　該輪印刷物品甚多。予蒙公司職員相贈三十餘册。其餘亦各得數册不等。其中頗多名貴攝影。印刷成本。所費不資。公司之善於招徠。於此可見一斑矣。五時離輪。與主人互道珍重而别。</p>
<p>▲破浪歸來亦留學生　歸途各校同學。互告此行之樂。並曰。今而後予等亦爲留學生矣。海慕華氏則表示對各大學生出洋事。願竭誠協助。並擬設一討論會。以便各同學共同參加。研究一切云。</p>
<h3>記近竹鄉水晶礦</h3>
<p>— 王日叟</p>
<p>日昨友人張君自福州來。爲言馬江近竹鄉採掘水晶礦一事。可供談助。兹誌之。以實自由談。</p>
<p>▲造墓得礦　馬江近竹鄉有一山焉。相傳中有水晶甚多。故名水晶山。惟水晶皆深埋山中。山大。無從採掘。近有任姓鄉人。爲先人造墓。乃雇工人多名。在水晶山所買之墓地開墾。及掘至八九尺時。發現潔白之石塊甚多。工人中之有經騐者。謂其下必有水晶。時主人尚未之知。乃相戒忽洩其事。</p>
<p>▲乘夜採掘　是夜工人等乘主人之未知。乃連夜採掘。至三丈左右。發現水晶甚多。事爲鄉人所知。羣來交涉。工人謂此水晶乃自己血汗採掘而得。應歸彼有。而任姓鄉人謂地屬彼有。必取回水晶。兩方固執。幾至動武。後經人調停。乃各分一半。當時以爲奇貨可居。不肯出賣。後以無處消售。乃肯以低價出賣。張君曾以二金購得水晶一顆。</p>
<p>▲水晶形狀　水晶每顆大如西爪。惟形狀則爲幾何式之多角體。外面石爲白色。不能透明。張君曾敲破其一角。始識其中皆透明之黑色水晶。外面所包者。特厚不盈分之白色石皮耳。或謂水晶全是透明。本無石皮包住。然則此種水品。尚未十分成熟。或另爲一種礦石乎。</p>
<h3>迦盦之逃畫</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>丹靑中之花卉。較諸山水人物爲尤難。則揮灑之傾。毫端自有靈趣。幅别具色香。否則作斷梗折枝。失諸粗擴。作並蒂密蕋失諸滯重。終難適如人意。當代花卉作家。以海虞陳製盦先生爲巨孹先生闢居吳中飲馬橋頭。賣畫爲活。山水人物。蟲魚鳥獸。無所不能。間寫花卉。輕倩秀逸。妙具韻致。不撫本。不臨稿。隨筆所至。自有章法。求其尺幀丈幅者。户限爲穿。先生終歳揮染。猶積件如山。難於償撥。先生又廣交游。朋侣趨譚。更誤畫晷。先生苦之。不得己。乃挾畫具。逃往滄浪亭間。調鉛殺粉。埋頭從事。及日崦　。始施施而歸。并家人亦不知其所自來也。先生畫倦。輒至觀前吳苑茶居。藉以疏散。奈茶居多熟客。熟客又多求畫。畫件積擱數月甚至數年者。見先生來。環而向之促索。畫債勝於錢債。先生無以應付、足跡不敢至吳苑茶居者兼旬。往往郊野訪古。冷攤拾舊。以爲逋逃之藪。童穉逃學。固所習聞。先生而逃畫。則眞藝苑奇談。足以軒渠。先生爲人喜詼諧。軀體肥碩。具羅漢形。爲冷紅會中表率。從之學畫者綦衆、小說家程小靑。曁烟橋介弟繫千。均其弟子。予曩肄業草橋學舍。以曾沐其春風也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三七九）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>那位局長。也是南邊人。倒很有誠意。却是專爲花老六而請的客。他就是一位經濟家。打了一點兒算盤他想這一塲賭。就算是爲花老六特設的。所抽下來的頭錢。可以說明是爲花老六捧塲的。即使頭錢不夠。自己倘然贏一點。可以凑成兩三千塊錢的總數。也算是個面子。誰知天下事往往出人預算之外。結果是主人家大輸。不但是自己輸得一敗塗地。把所有的頭錢。也都輸光。到了大家一哄而散以後。主人家很覺喪氣。原來花老六也知道這塲賭是爲伊特設的。心中很覺抱歉。非但是自己拿不到錢。反帶累主人家輸了一筆大欵子。伊說總怪我花老六運氣不濟。不但自己倒霉。反帶累了人家。可是這位主人家倒安慰伊。說我們常賭的人。輸輸贏贏。不算一回事。你也不必介意。他還簽了一張五百塊錢的支票。給花老六。說累你熬了一個夜。空手而歸。未免觸霉頭。這幾天内。我的手氣不好。待手氣好一點。我再給你想法子吧。可是賭錢的人。最重迷信。有許多平日間很開通的人。一到了賭錢的時候。便有許多迷信來了。那位局長自己輸了錢。却不怪自己。反倒遷怨到花老六身上來了。他想從前我也給南邊來的姑娘某人某人捧過塲。却很滿意。而自己還贏到錢。怎麽今天竟大輸特輸。大概伊是一個鈍貨。怪道伊生意不好。大概在走黑時期。賭錢人對於紅黑是非常注意的。因此凡遇賭錢。便不呌花元春的條子。再加以在許多賭友前一宣揚。花老六就遇不到豪賭的客人了。旣遇不到豪賭的客人。伊的城裏條子。就漸漸的少起來了。一個月以後。葉桐侯雖然來了。但他現在是一個商界中人。所認誠的朋友。也不是什麽頭等脚色。却不過花老六的情。也去吃過一回酒。打過兩塲牌。祇不過是普通應酬。而且他的分行在天津。他也常常要到天津去。忽忽光陰。花元春己到京有半年多了。可是生意並不見怎樣的起色。稍爲有了幾個錢。伊又不能積蓄。伊的原意。本當是弄到了幾個錢。就回到上海去的。但是不能如願以償。上海的兩個要好朋友。又常常的寫信來。彈動伊的心絃。不能無江南紅豆之思。在這悒悒鬱鬱中。忽然生起一塲病來了。</p>

<h3>何輯五之武昌號失事談</h3>
<p>▲中國航空公司發展之步驟</p>
<p>昨日、九江電載中國航空公司飛機武昌號、在潯墮落、乘客無恙等情、國聞社記者、昨特往訪中國航空公司總經理何輯五君、承告以詳情及公司近狀如下、</p>
<p>▲武昌號飛機　在漢時己略有損　　壞、故乘客三人、在漢即己退票、並未搭載、僅將空機滬修理、八日下午一時、經過九江、因受風擊、機身下墜、當即停於江西、幸由海軍部威勝兵艦、派艇援救、該機即由太古公司之黄浦輪運載來滬、現己送往龍華機廠修理、機師周璜、亦同時到滬、</p>
<p>▲觀察各機站　　何君本人、曾於本月六日（上星期五）由滬乘機、分往南京蕪湖安慶九江漢口各機塲視察、對於各站設備上多所督促改善、九日、始乘九江號飛機返滬、</p>
<p>▲公司之計劃　現在公司計劃、擬先將滬蓉綫展至宜昌、次開始京平航綫、再次將滬蓉綫展至重慶、然後開始滬粤航綫、最後完成滬蓉航綫、直達成都此計劃之步驟也、</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Approves League of Nations Arbitration Treaty, Conservative Party Amendment Defeated</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 9th - Foreign Secretary Henderson moved in the House of Commons today that the British Empire, except for those who are individual members of the League of Nations, should abide by the convention on the peaceful resolution of international disputes. This convention, drafted by the League of Nations Council, stipulates that disputes that cannot be resolved through ordinary legal procedures must be submitted to a special arbitration committee composed of five people. Each disputing country selects one person, and the remaining three are selected by mutual agreement from third countries. If the arbitrators cannot agree, the dispute is submitted to an arbitration court, also composed of five people, with the same method of selection. The decision of the arbitration court must be binding. The Foreign Secretary stated that the British Empire's adherence to this treaty is a natural consequence of the Kellogg Pact and the optional provisions establishing the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague. Britain has already recognized the optional provisions stipulating that justiciable disputes must be submitted to the Hague Court. Former Conservative government Foreign Secretary Chamberlain, representing the Conservative Party, moved an amendment arguing that this treaty would reduce the power of the League of Nations Administrative Council and that the treaty's mechanisms would only promote grounds for disputes. They did not wish to accept the treaty, stating that practical experience has limited compulsory arbitration, which this treaty lacks. This treaty lacks the flexibility and experience of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Henderson replied that he was well aware of the value of the League of Nations Administrative Council's actions. The Mosul dispute and the Hebron dispute were sufficient to demonstrate the power of the mechanisms contained in the League of Nations charter, but he did not believe that adhering to this treaty would reduce the power of the Administrative Council. Samuel of the Liberal Party spoke in favor of Henderson's motion. The House of Commons then defeated the Conservative Party's amendment by 231 votes to 139 and passed Henderson's motion.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi Attends Parliament After Recovering from Illness</h3>
<p>▲Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 10th - The plenary session of the House of Representatives opened in the afternoon of the 10th. Prime Minister Hamaguchi, supported by Koizumi, entered the chamber. Speaker Fujisawa announced the opening of the session. Amidst applause from the Minseito Party, Prime Minister Hamaguchi ascended the podium and said, "Gentlemen, due to an unexpected misfortune, I had to abandon state affairs for several months during a busy period. I regret that I was unable to meet with you and discuss national affairs until today. Recently, my health has gradually recovered. Yesterday, I relieved Kijūrō Shidehara of his duties as Acting Prime Minister, and at the same time, I resumed my duties as Prime Minister. From now on, I will be able to meet with you again." Inukai Tsuyoshi delivered a response, expressing "deep sympathy for Prime Minister Hamaguchi's unexpected disaster. We are delighted that he has now recovered. We hope that Prime Minister Hamaguchi will become healthier every day." After the speech, the cabinet members escorted Prime Minister Hamaguchi out of the chamber.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 10th - The executives of the Seiyukai Party held a meeting at 10 PM last night and decided on the following parliamentary strategies: (1) Judging from Prime Minister Hamaguchi's appearance when he entered the palace on the 9th, it is doubtful whether his health will allow him to safely pass through this parliamentary session. Therefore, questions to the Prime Minister after his illness should be given considerable consideration. (2) When Prime Minister Hamaguchi delivers his thank-you speech at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 10th, we will not adopt hostile behavior, but will approach him with a full display of Bushido spirit. We will express sympathy for the health of the Prime Minister after his illness and demonstrate the demeanor of a gentleman. All other actions will be left to President Inukai.</p>

<h3>Changes Among Political Parties in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Changes often occur among political parties in various countries because the changes in the world are endless, and the means to deal with world affairs are also different. Moreover, people's thoughts are difficult to fix; approval or disapproval often differs due to the environment. Politics is a tool for managing human affairs, and political parties are the pivot for shifting politics. If human affairs cannot be fixed and do not change, then changes among political parties will also occur from time to time.</p>
<p>Senators Borah and Norris of the United States will convene a conference of Republican progressives to propose a legislative program for the newly elected 72nd Congress. Several hundred well-known figures of liberalism have also been invited to attend. Borah was originally an important figure in the independent Republican Party, but his sudden convening of this conference indicates that he has effectively split with President Hoover. Borah had a close relationship with Hoover in 1928, and Borah contributed greatly to Hoover's election as president. This sudden split has drawn much attention in the United States.</p>
<p>After considering the settlement between the Indian Viceroy and Gandhi, the leader of the British Conservative Party has issued a decision that the Conservative Party will no longer participate in the Round Table Conference.

This announcement came suddenly, and it was not heard in Congress beforehand.</p>

<h3>Release of Indian Political Prisoners, Cancellation of Notice Banning the Sale of Foreign Cloth</h3>
<p>Gandhi Receives Enthusiastic Welcome from the Public Upon Returning to His Hometown</p>
<p>Conservative Party Resolves Not to Participate in Round Table Conference Again</p>
<p>▲Kokumin News Agency, Bombay, 9th - Since Gandhi and the Indian Viceroy reached an agreement yesterday morning, 5,000 political prisoners have been released so far. ▲Reuters, Bombay, 9th - The Indian Cloth Merchants' Association has cancelled the notice issued eight months ago banning the sale of foreign cloth. Bombay's largest foreign cloth market has been ordered to sell its existing stock of foreign cloth. ▲Reuters, Ahmedabad, 10th - Gandhi returned to Ahmedabad today, and the scene was very different from when he left a year ago. Then, Gandhi led a volunteer team on foot, starting the non-violent resistance movement. Today, he returned from Delhi amidst the enthusiastic welcome of his comrades, exactly one week and two days from his departure date. The train stopped at every station along the way, and crowds cheered and climbed onto the steps and engines, even disregarding their own safety, to climb onto the roof of the train to throw money and garlands at Gandhi. The King of Barampur boarded the train in Barampur, accompanied Gandhi for several stations, and sat with Gandhi in a third-class carriage on a wooden seat without cushions. One was dressed luxuriously, while the other was dressed simply, which was very striking.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 9th - After the Conservative Party's India Committee met in the House of Commons tonight, the Conservative Party leader announced the important decision that the Conservative Party will no longer participate in the Indian Round Table Conference. According to the official Conservative Party report, after careful consideration of the settlement between the Indian Viceroy and Gandhi, the committee welcomed Baldwin's proposal that the Conservative Party not participate in future Round Table Conferences. This startling decision was made in the middle of last week, before the conclusion of the Irwin-Gandhi talks and after the Conservative Party's India Committee presented its views to Baldwin. Tonight's resolution is merely a formal recognition of this decision. However, this announcement came suddenly, and it was not heard in Congress beforehand. The House of Commons is scheduled to debate the Indian issue on March 12th.</p>

<p>International News Three France's Combat Strength is More Substantial than Before the Great War</p>
<p>Disarmament Exists Only in Name</p>
<p>German Defense Minister Attacks French Army Chief</p>
<p>▲Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 9th - The German Parliament began debating the army and navy budget today. The speech by Defense Minister General Groener was particularly noteworthy. Groener said that although the far right and far left were launching fierce attacks, he had not made any changes to the original plan. Groener then refuted the recent remarks made by French Army Minister Maginot, who said that the military strength of various countries could not be equal. Countries that were attacked in the European War should be allowed to enjoy more advantages than the challenging countries. Groener said that the statement in Versailles that Germany was the sole instigator of the war has been absolutely denied by international historians and therefore cannot stand today. However, if historians around the world can impartially judge the issue, Germany is willing to accept their verdict. The reason why the Treaty of Versailles imposed disarmament clauses on Germany, and Germany did not protest, was not because it admitted to being the instigator of the war and was willing to be punished, but because it wanted to set an example and lead the way for global disarmament. Germany has now fulfilled the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and its level of disarmament is unmatched in the world. Therefore, today, Germany has the right to demand that the rest of the world disarm equally, so that all countries in the world can have equal security. Germany's demand is based on its due rights and for the sake of world peace and European rehabilitation, as these two points are the most urgent priorities of the moment. Groener then criticized French Army Minister Maginot's declaration that France has begun to disarm, saying that while the number of French divisions has indeed decreased and the length of military service has been shortened, its strength has not decreased, only slightly modified in its organization. Moreover, its combat strength has actually increased compared to before. Finally, Groener criticized Maginot's statistics on German military strength, saying that Maginot included police and customs officers in the military, but in reality, these personnel have nothing to do with Germany's military strength and national defense. No country includes them in the military.</p>

The destruction of houses, bridges, and roads is getting worse. Another church collapsed in Taolan. In Gilige, 70 of the only remaining houses after the previous earthquakes have now been destroyed. The situation is similar in other places, but because transportation is becoming increasingly obstructed, reports of the disaster cannot reach the outside world. People in Salonika are now living in tents in fear of another earthquake.</p>

Now that Stimson has this view, the steps that the US and Russian governments will take in the future to restore diplomatic relations are what the people want to know most.

<p>▲ Tribute Offerings: The main officiant of the ceremony was Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, and Shao YuanChong, members of the Central Committee and the National Government, assisted in the ceremony, which was conducted according to protocol. Chiang Kai-shek personally presented a floral wreath and read the memorial oration. Following that, Yu Youren, a member of the Central Committee, delivered a speech, stating that since the National Revolutionary Army set out from Guangdong, it had fought hundreds of battles, large and small. Many revolutionary comrades had sacrificed themselves for the Party and the Nation. In particular, during the recent rebellion of Yan and Feng, the Central Government launched a punitive expedition that lasted for several months, representing an unprecedentedly large-scale war. Numerous armed comrades sacrificed themselves for the Party, the Nation, and the Three Principles of the People. As the saying goes, "A man of firm resolve and benevolence will not seek life at the expense of benevolence, but will sacrifice his life to achieve it." General Commander Chiang endured hardship and difficulty, and amidst danger and turmoil, he led his comrades in diligent struggle to create a second China. This is a war history of the greatest commemorative value. Now that the major culprits have been eliminated, we must, after the pain subsides, reflect on the heroic deeds of the fallen generals and soldiers, continue the legacy of the martyrs, and realize the Three Principles of the People with a consistent spirit, fulfilling the purpose of peaceful unification. In this way, we can fulfill the responsibilities of those who live on and console the spirits of the martyrs. Anyone who undermines the Three Principles of the People and peaceful unification will be eradicated with full force. Next, Wang Chonghui, a member of the National Government, delivered a speech, stating that today's memorial service is an event that is both deeply sorrowful and profoundly meaningful. What did the martyrs die for? They died for the Three Principles of the People, for saving the Chinese nation. Those who have died are gone, their bodies may have perished, but their spirit is forever irreplaceable. After leaving this gathering, we must constantly remember the pain of their sacrifice, never forget their spirit of struggle, and resolve together to continue our efforts to fulfill their unfulfilled aspirations and console their heroic souls. Next, General Commander Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech, stating that it has been six years since the National Revolutionary Army began its expedition. The suffering endured by the martyrs who died and the generals and soldiers who participated in the battles during this period has been both great and immense. This kind of suffering cannot be fully understood by those who have not participated in the battles. In 1926, the Communists attempted to overthrow the Kuomintang in Guangdong. At that time, the arrogance of the Communists was not only capable of oppressing Guangdong but also of oppressing the entire China. At that time, the generals and soldiers in Guangdong tried their best to resist. During the crisis, I summoned Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi for a talk, vowing to fight the Communists to the death, and even saying that we might never meet again. The sorrow at that time was unknown to outsiders. As for the Jinan Incident, the pain was even more indescribable. At that time, all the generals and soldiers in Jinan were willing to die in Jinan, confronting the Japanese imperialists. The tragic situation and the spirit of unwavering courage in the face of danger were most gratifying. It was through this kind of sincerity that the foundation left by the late Premier could be maintained, allowing us to continue to complete the revolutionary work. However, we should be aware that in the successive battles, the remains of the comrades who have died have not yet been buried, and the parents, wives, and orphaned children they left behind have not been fully cared for. Before Tang Shengzhi's rebellion, he visited the school for orphans and widows and said that he would never again engage in mutual slaughter. But how long did it take before Tang betrayed us again, causing countless more soldiers to sacrifice their lives? Today, as we commemorate the fallen soldiers, we firmly believe that it will bring comfort to the families of our deceased comrades, that we will regard the parents and children of our deceased comrades as our own parents and children, and that we will fully shoulder and continue to strive for the unfulfilled aspirations of our deceased comrades. Only in this way can we console the spirits of the martyrs. If anyone still harbors ideas of power and self-interest, they are not true revolutionary soldiers. As for the compensation for the deceased comrades, the care for their families, the burial of their remains, and the resettlement of the disabled, preparations have already been made. I am presenting a report today. Since the beginning of the Northern Expedition, over the past six years, more than 300,000 soldiers have died. Last year, during the rebellion of Yan and the suppression of the communist bandits, approximately 2,480 officers and 34,453 soldiers died, and over 70,000 were wounded. The First, Second, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Eleventh, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Divisions, as well as the First Training Division, suffered the greatest losses, with an average of over 2,000 deaths per division, not including the wounded. Regarding the issue of compensation, the Ministry of Military Affairs has telegraphed to various provinces, cities, and counties to ensure full disbursement, totaling over 20 million. In the future, after the communist bandits have been completely eradicated and financial unification has been achieved, alternative compensation measures will be sought. Furthermore, preparations are underway for a cemetery for the fallen soldiers, which has already begun construction at Linggu Temple. Regarding the resettlement of disabled soldiers, a new village has been organized, capable of accommodating 5,000 to 10,000 people, so that the families of the disabled can also be accommodated. Plans are also being made to organize manufacturing facilities based on the degree of disability, so that they can have appropriate work. Regarding the resettlement of families of the deceased, a school for the families of the deceased has been established, currently divided into male and female schools, with over 500 students. The above is only a general report, and a detailed report will be issued in writing in the near future. Next, Wu Jingheng, a member of the Central Committee, and representatives from various military and political agencies, party headquarters at all levels, civilian organizations, and armies and divisions delivered speeches in succession. Then, under the leadership of General Commander Chiang, the entire assembly shouted slogans, and the ceremony was declared concluded.</p>
<p>▲ Central Party Headquarters Memorial Oration: On March 10, the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the entire members of the Central Executive Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, along with party members, respectfully offer fresh flowers and pure libations to the spirits of the soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who died in the suppression of the rebellion. The oration reads: Illustrious soldiers, the heroes of our Party, who for the revolution of the people, pledged loyalty and sincerity, obeyed orders in Lingnan, and pacified the Central Plains. Having experienced hundreds of battles, they considered hardship insignificant, shed blood in the wilderness, and sacrificed themselves for the Party and the Nation. Driven by the principles, their armies were bound to conquer. Alas, soldiers, may your souls be aware that the suppression of the rebellion was a righteous campaign, and that righteousness makes the army strong, frightening the rebellious bandits into flight. Our soldiers fought fiercely on the battlefield, their精 [energy/essence] piercing the sun, their will as sharp as autumn frost. Demonstrating loyalty and sincerity, they attacked with vigor, never retreating despite setbacks, ultimately crushing the masses of enemies. Scaling city walls and breaching enemy lines, they split their brains and stained the earth with their livers, holding their spears to defend the country, not hesitating to sacrifice their bodies. The battle has just ended, the war chariot has temporarily ceased, but the brave soldiers have not returned, and our grief is boundless. Who will seek their armor? We establish a household waiting for their ennoblement, and recite an invocation to summon their souls in vain, with no way to stem our tears. Achieving benevolence by seeking it, we have heard the ancient maxim that though the body perishes, the name endures, so there is no resentment or anger. Fragrant offerings of orchids and gui are presented, and libations are poured. May the spirits accept them, and come to partake in their honor. Accept our offering.</p>
<p>▲ National Government Memorial Oration: On March 10, the twentieth year of the Republic of China, all the staff of the Civil Service Department, the Military Affairs Department, and the Accounting Department of the National Government respectfully offer fragrant incense to the spirits of the soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who died in the suppression of the rebellion. The oration reads: Alas, amidst the trials and tribulations of thunder and rain, and the dimness of heaven and earth, if there were not a multitude of talents, who could quell the great disaster? The noble soldiers are loyal and brave without equal, sacrificing themselves in an instant for a righteousness that will last a thousand autumns. The Northern Expedition was successful, and the foundations of the nation were newly laid, but the remnants of evil spread rampantly, relying on arms to incite chaos. Our comrades, with one heart and ten thousand minds, held a sincerity that pierced gold and stone, and a spirit that rose through the wind and clouds. Pacifying Guangdong and Hunan in the south, and leveling Henan and Hebei in the north, with fierce and swift advances, they competed to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Wading through floodwaters that reached their ankles, scorched by the sun, suffering wounds and exposing blood, they regarded death as returning home, fighting to the death together. Amidst a hail of bullets and a forest of guns, they pressed on relentlessly, falling one after another but never ceasing, their spirit reaching a point of invincibility. Their blood stained the wild grass, their bones lay exposed in the Central Plains. Their heroic spirit rode the clouds, their loyal souls transformed into cranes, their blue blood and green phosphorus filling the desolate landscape. Not boasting of courage and strength, they revered the principles, living as patriots and dying as heroic spirits. Military prowess was displayed and cruel tyranny was finally vanquished, the sun shines again and the rivers and mountains are once again settled. As for the brave warriors, following the storms, following the mountains. Recalling their heroic deeds, our hearts are filled with boundless sorrow. Sad music echoes, fragrant flowers glow brilliantly. Return, O spirits, and grant us your blessings. Accept our offering.</p>
<p>▲ General Commander Chiang’s Memorial Oration: On this, the tenth day of March in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Chung-cheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, leading all military officers, reverently offers incense, flowers, and pure libations to the spirits of the fallen soldiers, saying: Alas, since the rise of our National Revolutionary Army to this day, it has been six years. Those who came before us include the late Premier and the late Party Representative Liao Zhongkai, and those who came after us include Cai Guangju, Liu Yaochen, and the more than 300,000 martyrs of officers, soldiers, and students, all of whom died before us. Though their deaths differed, they all died for the battles of our army and the principles of our party. Moreover, the tragedy and heroism of their deaths are sorrowful and painful. Though months or even years have passed, their spirits still seem to linger around us in our dreams, and we cannot forget them. Especially on moonlit nights when marching across the battlefield, we still feel a sense of kinship and love, as if they were members of our family, fathers and sons, constantly by our side. We are not even aware of why this is so. Alas, what in the world is more unbearable and intolerable than this? The rise of our army began with the Eastern Expedition against the rebellious Chen Jiongming and ended with the Northern Expedition against the traitor Yan Xishan. The battles fought in between, though only covering six years, extended across a vast territory, from east to west, from south to north, going back and forth, totaling over 20,000 li. In the spring of 1925, there were the battles of Danshui, Huizhou, Mianhu, Hepo, and Xingning. In the autumn of the same year, we returned to Guangzhou to suppress Yang Ximin and Liu Zhenhuan and to eliminate the remnants of Chen Jiongming's forces in the south. In the summer of 1926, we launched the Northern Expedition, including the battles of Tingsi Bridge on the Xiang-E Road, Mahui Ridge and Tujiapu on the Nanxun Road, as well as the siege of Nanchang and the siege of Wuchang, and the battles of Zhejiang and Anhui in the south. In the spring of 1927, there were the battles on the Jinpu and Pinghan lines. In the summer, there were the battles of Xuzhou and Longtan. In the spring of 1928, there were the battles of Jinan and Lincheng. In the spring of 1929, there was the battle of Wuhan. In mid-autumn, there were the battles of Dengfeng and Linru. In late autumn, there were the battles of Huaxian and Liangguang. In the winter, there was the expedition against Tang Shengzhi in Zhumadian. And then, in 1930, Yan Xishan rebelled and conspired, leading to the great battles on the Longhai, Pinghan, Jinpu, and Xiang-E four lines, as well as the armies dispatched to suppress the rebellion in Yunnan and Guangdong. The scale and intensity of these battles, in which I personally led the troops on the front lines, shared the hardships and dangers with our martyrs, and fought to the death together, numbered over a hundred. Alas, the poisonous flames reached the sky, causing rashes and diseases. In the barren land, the wind was sorrowful and the sun was dim. Whenever I read Li Hua's lines about snow covering the ankles, frost on the beard, inadequate warmth from cotton clothing, and fingers splitting from the cold, I cannot help but feel the grief that has been shared throughout history. In my youth, I often recited the words, "The soul is bound, the sky is dark and gloomy; ghosts and spirits gather, the clouds are thick and dense." I always felt an overwhelming sense of sorrow and grief. Who would have known that I would actually experience this myself, as I do today? The heartbreak and anguish are as if my flesh were being cut and pierced. However, the tragedy of the martyrs' deaths, the loyalty of their service, the courage of their self-sacrifice, and the unity of their lives and deaths are not only mourned by the people of the world and revered by the Party and the Nation, but are also seen, heard, and respected by countries in the East and West. However, the most tragic and sorrowful thing is that there are things that cannot be seen or heard by others, known only between the dead and the living, and yet cannot be spoken of or tolerated by the living. The grief and sorrow of this cannot be described by words or ink. What is the reason for this? It is the sincere spirit that even ghosts and gods weep for. As for the Shaji Incident on June 23, the anti-communist incident on March 20, and the Jinan Incident on May 3, the officers and soldiers who participated in those events either died or were wounded. Those who did not die, such as Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, who received orders in Dongshan to eliminate the communists, and Brigade Commander Li Yannian, who resolutely defended Jinan, recall the situation at that time of entrusting life in danger, of unwavering courage in the face of difficulty, and of the lingering sorrow of a farewell to the dead. The feelings were especially beyond the comprehension of outsiders and the endurance of ordinary people. Alas, the loyal hearts and the sincerity moved ghosts and gods and shook heaven and earth. This is truly the most tragic and sorrowful history of our Party and our army. It is through the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of heroes and martyrs that we have achieved the unified situation of today. Who knows that it was formed by the unwavering sincerity of the soldiers in a way that is unseen, unheard, unknown, and unnoticed? However, even this most tragic and sorrowful thing can still be described by us, the survivors, in a small way, to leave behind the admiration of later generations and the families of the deceased. As for enduring insults and tolerating shame to attract unexpected slander and lifelong grievances, not only can people not hear, see, or know, but even those involved could not have imagined it in their dreams. How much greater is the grief and sorrow of this? Alas, I have experienced a history of pain that has never been seen before and encountered a tragic situation that has never been seen in the world, and all of this has converged on me alone. How much greater is the hidden pain and suffering in my heart? Sadly, the heat and cold, freezing and scorching, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion are all hardships that ordinary people cannot endure, but our soldiers have endured them all. The horrors of cutting open abdomens and gouging out eyes, cutting off arms and amputating legs, unheard of in the world, have all been suffered by our soldiers. They regard the suffering of the Premier as their own family suffering, and the public grievances of the Party and the Nation as their personal grievances. They endure national humiliation that others cannot endure, and suffer party shame that others cannot accept. They leave their parents, bid farewell to their wives, fall one after another, regard death as returning home, and have no regrets. Why is this? It is because the late Premier's teachings on loving each other with sincerity are accumulated in their hearts and manifested in their actions. Alas, the dead are gone, but how can the living bear it? Who does not have parents, with white hair in the hall, waiting to be cared for? Who does not have a wife, a widow in the room, who still needs to be raised? Whenever I think of the parents of the soldiers, they are my own parents. The families of the martyrs are the families of the Premier. The reason why we, the survivors, endure shame without regret and tolerate death for a moment is only because the remains have not yet been buried and the families have not been cared for. It is not just because the revolution has not been completed and the principles have not been realized. As the ancients said, "While there is still breath, this aspiration will not cease." I will only exhaust the unfulfilled responsibilities of the deceased and strive to complete the unfulfilled aspirations of the martyrs. Alas, death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. As the ancients said, "Sacrificing oneself to achieve benevolence" and "Though dead, still alive," the martyrs died to fight for the survival of the Party and the Nation, to fight for the independence of the nation, to die for the revolution, to die for the principles, to die for unification. What is there to regret in death? In the world, no one can escape death, only in dying in the right place. Death is as good as dying with righteous people, and death is to be included in the ranks of righteousness, so one does not lose one's righteous destiny. The deaths of the martyrs were all in the ranks of revolutionary soldiers and in the midst of the Premier's principles. The glory of their death is enough to illuminate China and foreign countries and to be passed down through the ages. Why should I be sad? Why should I be sorrowful? I am only ashamed that we, the survivors, have not fulfilled our responsibilities as survivors, have not fulfilled the aspirations of the martyrs, report our face to the world, and feel guilty before the gods. We grieve for those who survive and are saddened by those who have not died, and we cannot help but offer sacrifices to the martyrs in order to sacrifice ourselves, those who survive. This is why we are sad and grieved, to mourn the tragedy of the deaths of our soldiers, and cannot restrain ourselves. Alas, with the spirits of the martyrs as witnesses, may this sincerity come and receive our offerings. Accept our offering.</p>
<p>▲ Deputy Commander Zhang’s Memorial Oration: On the tenth day of March in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, dispatched his representative, Yang Huancai, to respectfully offer fragrant wine and various sacrifices to the spirits of the soldiers who died in the suppression of the rebellion, saying: Alas, the country is in danger, and chaos flows rampant. Great vermin run amok, inciting the communist party, shaking the foundation of the nation, and endangering the laws of heaven. Rampaging through Shandong and Henan, poisoning Hubei and Hunan, the Chinese people were oppressed. Our army advanced to suppress them, vowing to sweep away the demonic forces and uphold the righteous path. Noble and courageous troops fight bravely, rushing to various provinces, battling for years. The army is sharp and unwavering, determined to knock down those aiming high, and to let eternal glory shine. We respectfully offer fresh flowers, and we use our sincerity to remember their fragrance. Alas, accept our offering.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren's Report on the National Assembly and Provisional Constitution at the Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Explaining the Necessity of Reform Today</p>
<p>At the Central Party Headquarters' memorial week on the 9th, Yu Youren reported on the "National Assembly and Provisional Constitution," with the following remarks: The convocation of the National Assembly is in accordance with the late Premier's will. As the opening date approaches, our party comrades should make every effort to ensure its success. Recalling the difficult and arduous circumstances when the Premier went north from Guangzhou and passed away in Beijing, and his ardent hope for the convocation of the National Assembly, it remains vivid in my mind. When the Premier went north, he issued a Northern Expedition Declaration, which outlined two objectives for convening the National Assembly: (1) to seek peace and unification within the country to resolve the people's livelihood issues, and (2) to abolish unequal treaties externally to enhance our international standing. It also explained the significance of convening the National Assembly as a combination of revolutionary military force and the people. The so-called revolutionary military force in the past referred to the failure of the revolutionary military to unify the country at that time. From the current perspective, it is to seek a combination of the government and the people. The function of this combination is: 1. From the perspective of the government itself, to seek the development of all work to meet the needs of the people. Only in this way can the benefits of work development accrue to the people. 2. From the perspective of the people, to enable the people to choose what they need. Only in this way can the needs of the people be fully expressed. The convocation of the National Assembly now is to realize this important meaning.</p>
<p>Last week, Committee Member Dai reported that "the tasks of the National Assembly are to make the Three Principles of the People clearly accepted by the people of the whole country in law, and to make the people of the whole country clearly recognize in law that the establishment of the Republic of China should be based on the Outline of National Reconstruction," and declared that "there should be a covenant between the government and the people." Now that the whole country has been peacefully unified, and during the period of political tutelage, in order to communicate the will between the government and the people, and to convene the National Assembly, the legal provisions regarding the relationship between the government and the people are indeed the most important task of the Assembly. Last week, the Central Provisional Standing Committee passed the establishment of the Provisional Constitution Drafting Committee, which shows that the Central Government is determined to have a Provisional Constitution. The first Provisional Constitution Drafting Meeting will be held this afternoon. Because our party comrades may have unclear understandings, I will explain this issue in detail to everyone again.</p>
<p>From the history of our party, from the Revive China Society to the Tongmenghui, from the Tongmenghui to the Chinese Revolutionary Party, from the Chinese Revolutionary Party to the Kuomintang. The Revive China Society was the initial stage, the Tongmenghui and the Chinese Revolutionary Party were the founding stages, and the Kuomintang was the mature stage. In each stage, during the time of the Tongmenghui, the Premier had already established his great propositions, such as the Three Principles of the People, the Five-Power Constitution, and the Three Stages of National Reconstruction, all of which were clearly announced. At that time, imperialism was invading the East, and the Chinese people were in a state of dormancy. The Premier was able to observe the national conditions internally and assess the overall situation externally, and create the Three Principles of the People, the Five-Power Constitution, and the Three Stages of National Reconstruction. This is not only a major event in China, but also a significant event worthy of commemoration in the world. However, everyone knows that the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution were created exclusively by the Premier, while the Three Stages of National Reconstruction are often overlooked, and considered a very ordinary matter. In fact, it is also very difficult to invent. In ancient China, there was a distinction between the ages of disorder, rising peace, and great peace, which is found in the Gongyang Commentary. Also, in the Book of Rites, there is a distinction between the ages of Great Unity and Lesser Tranquility. When we read these books, we often skimmed over them, neglecting the creative essence of the ancient sages. Many years ago, the Premier, in the preface to Liu Chengyu's "History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," also gave an explanation of the revolutionary process: "First, the military government period, where sovereignty lies with the military government, and an ordinance is issued to the people; second, the tutelage period, where sovereignty lies with the government, and a jointly agreed covenant is established with the people; third, the constitutional government period, where sovereignty lies with the people, and a fully constitutional state is organized." He also lamented the death of Hong Xiuquan, saying that he did not understand the meaning of military government and constitutional government, which led to Zeng Guofan's奏成(helped complete) the Restoration of the Qing Dynasty. The Russian Revolution had what was called the New Economic Policy period, and the Communists admired Lenin's keen eye. In fact, they did not know that it was influenced by the Four Principles of the Tongmenghui in China. It can be said that they accepted the strategies indicated by the Premier to our party comrades. I have repeatedly cited examples from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, to prove the importance of the Three Stages of National Reconstruction, in order to make our party comrades deeply understand the late Premier's will, which says, "I have devoted myself to the national revolution for forty years." In these forty years, the Premier's revolutionary spirit has been completely consistent, and his general propositions have never been changed in the slightest. Those who follow it will be governed, and those who oppose it will be chaotic, which is inevitable. Therefore, to go a step further, from the Tongmenghui to the present day, the Premier's propositions have a binding force in the revolutionary process.</p>
<p>Since the success of the Northern Expedition, the voices for the National Assembly and the Provisional Constitution have risen. The Central Government has also discussed it several times. After the Fifth Plenary Session of the Second National Congress, the voices subsided. After the great war last year, the voices for the National Assembly and the Provisional Constitution were raised again by the people and the Central Government. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third National Congress, the voices also subsided. The Premier's division of the Three Stages of National Reconstruction, in the Tongmenghui, was military government, provisional constitution, and constitutional government, and in the revolutionary strategy, it was military government, tutelage government, and constitutional government. Changing provisional constitution to tutelage government did not change the proposition of the provisional constitution, because the word "tutelage" has a broader scope and can include everything. Therefore, the Premier also stated, "During the period of tutelage government, the provisional constitution will be implemented," and the words "not the current one" are noted in parentheses. He also explained painfully and clearly, pointing out the mistake of not following his revolutionary program in the first year of the Republic. The serious mistake of the Provisional Constitution of the first year of the Republic was that the legislators did not necessarily fully understand revolutionary doctrines, so the Provisional Constitution they drafted was completely separate from revolutionary doctrines, and was too far from what our party and the people demanded, and even had nothing to do with the legislators themselves. This kind of Provisional Constitution, which was separated from revolution, separated from the people, and separated from itself, was either outdated or transcended the times, so it became a relic of the Republic of China. In the Declaration of the Outline of National Reconstruction formulated by the Premier in the thirteenth year of the Republic, it was argued that the Provisional Constitution of the first year of the Republic did not go through the two stages of military government and tutelage government, so it could not have practical effect. It did not fundamentally deny the proposition of the Provisional Constitution in the national reconstruction program. Its meaning is that without going through the military government period, the counter-revolutionary forces cannot be eliminated, which puts military personnel at risk of abusing the provisional constitution. Without going through the tutelage government period, the people will be suddenly liberated and will not be able to understand the true meaning of the relationship between the provisional constitution and themselves. It refers to the fact that the first year of the Republic had neither escaped the military period nor achieved tutelage government. Now that the military has been pacified and tutelage government has achieved considerable results, it is time for our party to support democracy, and the situation is no longer the same as before. There is no longer a danger of those who oppose the revolution taking advantage of it, nor is there a deeply ingrained habit of abandoning responsibility. It is the right time to draft a provisional constitution to seek cooperation between the people and the government. In the past two years, some scholars who did not understand revolutionary doctrines embraced the theory of human rights and talked extensively about the provisional constitution. They did not know that the civil rights in the provisional constitution that the Premier referred to are revolutionary civil rights, which are completely different from the civil rights theories of religious figures and past politicians that they picked up. Today, I am explaining this meaning in the hope that everyone will conduct in-depth research on the provisional constitution issue and contribute to the Central Government to consolidate the foundation of peaceful unification and achieve long-term peace and stability.</p>
<h3>Commencement of Sino-Japanese Railway Negotiations</h3>
<p>▲ Gao Jiyi and Kimura Discuss the Results</p>
<p>▲ Will Assign Commissioners to Discuss Concrete Details</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese railway negotiations, Kimura, director of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), and Gao Jiyi, chairman of the Northeast Communications Committee, held their first meeting at the office of the Beining Railway at 3 p.m. yesterday. Irie Shotaro, director of the Fengtian office of the SMR, and Kimura Tatsuo, interpreter of the SMR office, accompanied Director Kimura to the meeting. On the Chinese side, in addition to Gao Jiyi, there were also Guo Xurun, director of the Jichang and Jidun Railways, and Yin Shousong, chief of the general affairs section of the Jichang and Jidun Railways. There was a very long discussion regarding the formal commencement of railway negotiations. It was agreed that both sides would assign commissioners to conduct concrete discussions. As for the assignment procedures, Guo Xurun representing Gao Jiyi and Irie Shotaro representing Director Kimura will hold their second meeting in the next two or three days. (March 6)</p>
<h3>Liu Zerong, Special Commissioner of the Sino-Soviet Conference, Requests Leave to Return Home</h3>
<p>▲ Accompanied by Staff Members Xie Yixing and Others</p>
<p>▲ Mo Dehui Arrives in Harbin from Liaoning</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Mo Dehui, plenipotentiary of the Sino-Soviet Conference, who went to Beijing to seek instructions, returned from the capital and passed through Shenyang, where he stayed for several days. He departed from Shenyang by train on the evening of the 4th of this month and arrived in Changchun early on the 5th. He then transferred to a train to Harbin. However, when the special train passed through Shuangchengbao, it stopped for half a day to visit relatives and friends and pay respects at the graves. It was scheduled to arrive at about 6 p.m. on the 5th, and the Dong Railway sent a car to meet him, arriving in Harbin at about 7 p.m. Although Mo's departure abroad was scheduled for March 15 in Beijing, it is heard that due to delays in various matters and the fact that the Dong Railway Council still needs to convene a meeting before departure to solve recent road matters, he will not leave until late March at the earliest. Mo has already telegraphed diplomatic messengers to prepare various food items to be transported by train when he goes to Russia. Before Mo goes to Russia, Liu Zerong, the special commissioner acting as plenipotentiary, along with delegation staff members Xie Yixing, secretaries Feng Jie, Wu Jialu, Tao Guilin, and diplomatic messenger Fu Zhanyuan, returned to Harbin from Russia on the evening of the 4th of this month. Liu and others departed from Russia on the 24th of last month. The train was delayed along the way. It should have arrived in Harbin at 8:35 a.m. on the 4th, but it was delayed until 9:50 p.m. Those who arrived at the station to welcome them that night included Jin Ronggui, advisor to the Dong Railway Superintendent's Office, Li Shaogeng, acting director, Guo F绵監事長Fu Mian, supervisor, and 40 or 50 section chiefs from various departments. After Liu and others got off the train, they returned to their residences separately. At about 10 p.m. on the evening of the 4th, the reporter visited Liu Zerong at his residence at 花園街 Garden Street, Qinjiagang. According to his conversation, he and several colleagues returned home this time because the delegation had no important business after Plenipotentiary Mo returned home to seek instructions. At the beginning of their trip abroad, they did not expect to stay in Russia for such a long time and missed their hometowns. Therefore, they took a few days of leave before the Plenipotentiary returned to Russia to take a look. It is expected that they will not stay in the country for many days. When Plenipotentiary Mo goes to Russia, they will still accompany him. After my return, the affairs of the delegation will be temporarily handled jointly by the three gentlemen, Special Commissioners Wang Zengwei Juwei Zeng and Secretary Cai Yunchun. Before returning home, I saw Karahan off and told him that Plenipotentiary Mo had a definite date to go to Russia, which he was very pleased to hear. At the beginning of their stay in Russia, many members of the delegation suffered from acclimatization problems. Later, as they stayed in Russia for a long time, they no longer had this phenomenon. The climate in Moscow is very good. Even in the past winter, I heard that the temperature here had reached minus 46 degrees, but the coldest temperature in the Russian capital was only over 20 degrees. As for the future of the conference, it is difficult to predict. Each side has its own propositions. Whether the propositions of the two sides will be consistent in the future remains to be determined by future negotiations. However, after the proposal to proceed with group discussions, the difference is that the Russian side wants to discuss the issue of restoring diplomatic relations first, while our side wants to discuss the Dong Railway first. Although there are differences in the middle, it will not hinder the progress of the conference. (March 5)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Central Bank Resumes Redemption of 50-Yuan Notes</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the Guangdong Central Bank temporarily suspended redemption on September 30 of the 18th year of the Republic, after the situation stabilized, all 100-yuan, 1-yuan, 5-yuan, and 10-yuan notes have been redeemed in installments. Recently, in addition to issuing military treasury and financial notes, the fund of the Central Bank has become sufficient again. It is estimated that the Central Bank has no less than 20 million in cash, while issuing about 30 million in banknotes. The ratio of reserves to the amount of issuance is 3 to 2. On the 5th of this month, it was announced that the 50-yuan notes that had not been redeemed would also be redeemed. From the time the bank stopped redeeming banknotes two years ago until yesterday, it can be said that all banknotes have been redeemed. At the same time, all branches and sub-branches in various places have unrestricted redemption. In the future, all tax revenues will be received in cash. In order to facilitate the redemption of banknotes, the Central Bank had previously notified the citizens that redeemers in the city could go to the West Embankment office or the Yonghan branch office to redeem them in full at any time. Unexpectedly, before and after the start of redemption, the Central Bank was quite crowded. In order to cope with the large number of redemptions, the Central Bank had prepared a large amount of cash for redemption and dispatched staff to the South Embankment headquarters and branches to assist in redemption. The measures were fairly smooth. According to Fan Qiwu, director of the Department of Finance, the Central Bank has issued about 20 to 30 million banknotes, and the Central Bank's fund is about 20 million yuan. In addition to more than 2 million being used for external loans, there are still 17 million yuan in the bank. With such sufficient cash in recent days, there is great confidence after the announcement of unrestricted redemption. Also, the reason for the rise in foreign currency yesterday was that the Guangdong Customs had collected too much foreign currency in taxes five days ago, resulting in an oversupply of foreign currency on the market, which caused the skyrocketing of foreign currency. In order to regulate finance, the authorities have not only continued to resume redemption in recent days, but also ordered the Guangdong Customs to receive Central Bank banknotes for all tax revenues from the 5th onwards, in order to facilitate circulation. In this situation, it is expected that the price of banknotes on the market will be restored in a few days. (March 6)</p>
<h3>Rampancy of the Red Spear Society in Yicheng, Shanxi</h3>
<p>▲ The Number of Bandits Reaches More Than 4,000</p>
<p>▲ Reported to Have Been Dispersed by Garrison Troops</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Yicheng County in southern Shanxi has been invaded by Red Spear Society bandits from Henan Province. Because the county is a thoroughfare between Henan and Shanxi, many people from Henan reside there. The residents of Yicheng have the custom of practicing boxing due to the relationship of contamination, but they did not expect that practicing boxing would cause harm to the local area. This incident initially involved only 30 or 40 people, who started in mountain villages in the east of the city. Within a few days, the number grew from dozens to hundreds to more than 4,000. The speed of its spread and the magnitude of its momentum were even greater than the Boxer Rebellion of the Gengzi year. According to those who came from the county, when they left the county, the number of bandits had gathered to more than 4,000, occupying 70 or 80 villages. They ordered the residents of each village to supply rice, flour, red cloth, yellow tables, incense, cigarettes, wooden poles, spears, etc. They wore black clothes, wrapped red cloth around their heads, and carried spears. Some also carried firearms. They claimed to be blessed by a heavenly master, immune to guns and knives, and immune to gunpowder. They used the slogans of resisting taxes and eliminating harm for the people. There were both male and female bandits, both from Henan and Shanxi. When it first happened, the county police and militia immediately surrounded and suppressed them. Both sides engaged in battle and suffered deaths. Later, because the bandit forces were too large and the police force was no match, the county magistrate requested the local garrison troops of Zhang Renjie to assist in the suppression. Yang Chengyuan, who was stationed in Linfen, also sent a battalion of troops to assist in the suppression after receiving the report. However, the county has reported to the provincial government that the bandits have been wiped out by the garrison troops and county police. The people suffered great losses from this disaster. A certain gentleman Wang has been sent to the province to pay respects to the authorities and ask for instructions on how to deal with the aftermath. The county is about 700 miles away from the province. The provincial government has not received detailed information about the bandit situation in the county in recent days. We will investigate and report further. (March 6)</p>
<h3>Henan Bandits Invade the Border of Woyang and Suxian</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Woyang and Suxian in northern Anhui have been plagued by bandits for years, which has become commonplace. Yang Xieyue, a major bandit in eastern Henan, recently colluded with local bandits in Woyang and Suxian and led more than 2,000 men into Anhui Province last month. They dispersed into small groups and harassed the border areas of Woyang and Suxian. The bandits have cannons, mortars, and machine guns, and their power is very rampant. Moreover, more than half of the group are defeated soldiers, so their actions are not comparable to ordinary local bandits. They first occupied the area around Genghuang Temple in Woyang. After the 270th Regiment of the 45th Division, led by Liu Zixin, launched a suppression campaign, Liu's regiment suffered minor losses due to the large number of bandits. Wei Lihuang then added the 1st Regiment of the Independent Brigade, led by Mei E, to intercept them from Bengbu. The Zhang Baoguo group of more than 1,000 bandits then directly invaded Suxian at the beginning of the month, while the rest still occupied the northeast area of Woyang. It is heard that Zhang Baoguo, nicknamed Zhang Dashen, is extremely fierce. When he arrived in Suxian, he was attacked by the 3rd District Defense Corps of the county at the Dawangmiao Bridge. After three hours of contact, dozens of bandits were killed and two hostages were rescued. The bandits fled north and burned down Hanzhai, Jiangyan, and Zhuzhuang before leaving. Later, they detoured through Miaohua area of Yongcheng County and transferred to Xudaowa and Kongzhuang, 20 miles west of Suixi in Suxian, and committed looting and kidnapping. At the same time, the Zhang Chuanwen gang of bandits in the county also disturbed Tangjiazhai, 35 miles northwest of Linhuan, and echoed Zhang Nian from afar, and contained the people's regiment from blocking and suppressing. Wang Xinlan, the county magistrate of Suxian, repeatedly reported the situation. He has now dispatched the county garrison team to suppress them at full speed and requested the 7th Division to draw a part to assist in the attack to prevent the bandits from fleeing east again.

<h3>Wuhu Quick News</h3>
<p>▲ The former Ganzhou bandits fled into Anhui, and the Anhui authorities sent troops to defend against them at Yinjiahui. Recently, another group of Ganzhou bandits has reached Kaihua in Zhejiang from Changshan and Yushan, approaching the Huizhou region of Anhui Province. The people of Huizhou are extremely alarmed and have gathered the security teams, militias, and hunters from various counties to set up defenses as needed. Unexpectedly, the Huizhou merchants in Wuhu received a telegram from Tunxi yesterday, saying that a part of the Ganzhou bandits had broken through and fled to the Beixiang of Xiuning in Huizhou. Tunxi is extremely tense. The Huizhou Guild Hall in Wuhu convened an emergency meeting to request the authorities to send troops to block and suppress the bandits. ▲ Although the central government has repeatedly ordered the abolition of the rice inspection donation and salt levy surcharge established by the Anhui Provincial Government, the province still collects them as usual because it relies on them to subsidize military and political expenses. Because of too much accumulated rice, the rice merchants in Wuhu had to pay donations to export it. Recently, the Executive Yuan issued a strict order to abolish the Anhui Province rice and salt inspection fees on the same day, and the rice industry associations implemented strikes and stopped transportation the day before yesterday due to repeated telegrams of opposition from the Guangzhou Rice Industry Association. All transactions were stopped upstream and downstream of the river, and the situation suddenly became serious. The chief inspector of the round transport rice inspection immediately telegraphed the province to ask for instructions on how to deal with the situation. Zhao Jingshi, director of the Wuhu Public Security Bureau, Yu Yuying, the county magistrate, and leaders from all walks of life believed that the overall strike of the rice industry was related to the lives of thousands of workers and was extremely important to the security of the city. They also tried their best to mediate, and the situation was finally resolved last night. Work resumed today, and the condition was that rice and grain exports would not be subject to current donations for the time being and would be registered first pending a final resolution.</p>
<p>▲ The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce reorganized the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce. It was originally scheduled to be established on the 9th. However, a sudden clash occurred at the meeting of the industry guilds in the General Chamber of Commerce the day before yesterday when discussing business expenses and representative distribution. The chairman, Tao Yutang, was almost beaten. Tao, who also served as the reorganization instructor, telegraphed the province for instructions and has now been ordered to strictly investigate and arrest the troublemakers. The reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce must still be established within the time limit and must not be delayed. (February 8)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Warden of the Detention Center Accused by Detainees in a Letter: The Gao Ying couple's case of trafficking in soil is being retried by the High Court for Gao and Sun Yuan on the 26th of this month. However, Gao's wife, Ms. Liao, has not recovered from her illness since giving birth in custody. In January of this year, the Ministry of Justice of the capital received a letter of accusation from a detainee in the Third Sub-prison of Siqian Street, accusing Gao Yi, the head of the Second Section and warden of the Sub-prison, of engaging in certain behaviors with her when she went out for medical treatment. After receiving the accusation, the Ministry of Law sent a person to Suzhou to secretly investigate. The result was that there was no evidence. It was found that although she had gone to the Tianci Village Boxi Hospital for medical treatment three or two times a month between autumn and winter last year, each time the time did not exceed three hours, and a guard director and a female guard accompanied her. She was immediately escorted back to the detention center after the diagnosis. She usually talked to him, etc. Later, the High Court transferred the section chief to the position of prison officer in Chuansha County in early February.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Two Cases of Assaulting Police and Resisting Arrest: Zhou Jiashan, Director of the 8th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, received a tip-off yesterday that Cai Kui Chu's family in Banqiao Town, Kaihua Township, was selling red pills and privately selling opium smoking paraphernalia. Director Zhou immediately dispatched three police officers to search the premises. As a result, they arrested three opium offenders, Zhu Yaoqing and others, and seized evidence such as opium lamps, opium pipes, and red pills. While the police were escorting them to the bureau, a teahouse next door, run by Zhu Gengsheng, was gathering gamblers for a gambling session. One of the gamblers, Zhu Rongqing, upon seeing his brother Yaoqing being arrested, consulted with the teahouse owner Zhu Gengsheng. They led the gamblers in a rush to snatch the three opium offenders away, and severely injured police officers Du Bingnan and Zhang Jinrong. Another police officer, Zhang Shicheng, escaped and reported to Director Zhou, who immediately led officers to arrest Zhu Gengsheng, who had incited the riot, and took him to the bureau. At the same time, the injured police officers were sent to the hospital for treatment. Simultaneously, Tan Nan, Director of the 12th Branch of the Public Security Bureau in the 6th District (Tianxiashi), Bashi Bridge, received a report from Sun of Xuxiang that his nephew, Bao Akun, instigated by Bao Peisheng, had forcibly felled trees without reason the day before, destroyed four manure vats, and severely injured him when he protested. Director Tan immediately dispatched several police officers, together with Zhao Jinmin, the head of the district, to summon the suspect Bao Akun to the bureau for legal action. However, a group of villagers, including Feng Jingen, falsely claimed to be village chiefs and deliberately resisted the summons, assaulting police officer Guan Zilian and tearing his uniform and insignia. The other police officers on the scene then arrested the assailants Feng Jingen, Xu Lunbao, Wang Jinbao, Qiao Shungen, and the suspect Bao Akun, taking all five to the bureau for investigation. They were then transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>The Case of the Seizure of Opium at Dayi Bridge Has Been Solved: On the evening of the 2nd of this month, two boats carrying a large quantity of opium passed through the city river of Dayi Bridge Town, Jiuzhe District, this county. Local hooligans learned of this and gathered many people to follow the boats to the edge of the market, where they drew pistols and carried out a robbery. As a result, the two boats' worth of opium was seized. It was not until the afternoon of the 4th that Zhu Shunqing of the detective team returned to Changshu from Shanghai and learned of the incident. He immediately reported to Director Yin of the Public Security Bureau, who that night sent inspector Cheng Bin to the countryside for a secret investigation, and also sent inspector Chen Pinquan to supervise. They obtained some clues and searched the homes of the opium robbers Qian Beilin, Shi Heshang, and Wang Gengsong, but found that they had abandoned their homes and fled. Only Shi Pangshi, the wife of Shi Heshang, was taken to the bureau for investigation. Later, it was said that the main culprits had fled to Xieqiao, or were hiding in Xingfu and other places. The Public Security Bureau sent police officers to investigate and arrest them, but without success. The Public Security Bureau then sent inspector Cheng and detective team leader Zhu Shunqing and others, leading a team to the countryside to investigate and arrest them strictly. After two days, there was no result. Only a large amount of rice, yellow beans, and other items were found in Qian Linlin's house. Until the evening of the 7th, a secret agent reported that Qian Linlin was hiding at the home of a relative surnamed Yao in Cui Jia Xiaoqiao. They then went with the 10th resident station of the district. It was already around 2:00 AM. When they arrived at the place, they saw a figure speeding away. The police ordered them to stop, but the person continued to move forward. The police fired a shot from their box gun, and the person stopped. They went forward and arrested the person, who turned out to be Qian Linlin, the main culprit of the robbery. When asked where the soil was hidden, he said it was in his father Yao Nannan's pig shed. The police went to investigate, but Yao Nannan had already fled after receiving the news. In the pig shed in his home, they found a large quantity of opium, which was loaded into sacks and baskets by the police, and Qian Linlin was taken back to the resident station. At 5:00 AM the next morning, he was transferred to the Public Security General Bureau in the city. Inspector Cheng and others separately reported the investigation to Director Yin. At about 9:00 AM, Director Yin invited Secretary Jin of the County Government, Supervisory Committee member Shi Minyong of the County Party Department, and members of the Rejection Society to the bureau to inspect and weigh the items in detail. In total, there were 127 packages of Sichuan-Yunnan soil, weighing 357 catties and eight and a half taels. The director then personally affixed the seal of the Public Security Bureau and sealed them together. In the afternoon, Lu Zhibin, the head of the third section, interrogated the prisoners separately. According to Qian Linlin, he is from this county and has been working as a car driver in Shanghai, Zhejiang and other places for 12 years. He is currently driving at Guanghua University in Shanghai. This time, he returned to Changshu for some matters. As for the soil robbery, there was a Jiangyin friend surnamed Zhu, whose name he did not know. He often stays in Shanghai, and when he comes to Changshu, he often goes to the Zhang family at No. 38 behind the Shui Xian Temple outside the South Gate. I am not very close to him. He once came to my house for a meal last year. The day before yesterday, the Zhu surname came to Dayi Bridge again and saw me. At that time, I did not talk about the soil. Until the afternoon of the 2nd, I was about to go to the city when the Zhu surname called me to go up to the teahouse and he said to me, today three sand boats are passing by, I want to ask you to call a few people to help. I went to call Shi Heshang, Wang Gengsong, Wang Binggen, and others. Near the evening, I saw a sand boat passing by, and later two more boats passed by. Zhu jumped onto a boat with us, went to the sand boat at the ferry at the end of the market, and transported their soil here. The pistol was not held by me. Later, the sand boat left, and we also rocked to another place. At that time, I saw these things, and I dared not report it. I was afraid and fled. As for Zhu, I don't know where he went. The rice and beans were half deposited in my house by the bean curd shop, and half were my own. When asked about Shi Pangshi, she said that her husband, Shi Heshang, was a farmer by trade, and did not know about the soil robbery. Later, the Public Security Bureau temporarily detained Qian and others in the bureau, and prepared a document together with the opium and the prisoners to be sent to the county judiciary for review. The ten resident stations of Qian Linlin's family's rice and beans are guarded by police.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Honghu Steamboat Was Robbed: The Honghu steamboat of the Yongxing Company of Shaobo, which runs the Xing Shao route, departed from Shao at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, carrying a total of seven passengers. At 8:00 PM that night, while traveling through Qizhuang, more than ten miles from Chuanchuan, seven bandits were seen on both sides of the bank, carrying box cannons. They fired at the boat and ordered it to stop. The driver knew there was a bandit alert and could not resist, so he docked the boat on the shore. The bandits then boarded the boat from the tugboat and searched it, taking away about 200 yuan in cash, jewelry, clothes, and other items. They also shot and injured an old man in the fire cabin and two passengers. The boat has now returned to Shaobu, and the injured have been taken to the Yian Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the old man has not yet had the bullet removed and has been sent to Laiyang for treatment.</p>
<p>The Process of Surrendering Weapons by the Xinzhen Business Corps: Regarding the dispatch of a team from the Yangzhou garrison to Xian to collect the guns of the town's business corps, it is now known that at 10:00 AM on the 7th, Shao Xiao Zhang Yuan, sent by the Superintendent, and Li Qinhu, commander of the 94th Brigade, led a team of soldiers. Under the secret order of the Superintendent, they went to Xian to meet with Wu, the captain of the 23rd team of the 6th District of the Water Public Security Bureau, and together with Zhang Wen, the director of the 4th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, led the police to the residence of the business corps. They collected more than a dozen long and short guns and arrested Wang Changfa, the platoon leader of the corps, and sent him to the military law office of the Superintendent for interrogation. Tao, the captain of the corps, knew the wind and avoided the situation afterward.</p>
<p>Four Banks Merchants Petition to Maintain Introduction Tickets: The Hunan, Hubei, West Anhui and Anhui Four Banks Grain Merchants Federation petitioned the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Salt Administration, and the Central Political Committee in response to the Legislative Yuan's resolution to abolish introduction tickets and collect taxes on the spot, appealing to maintain introduction tickets to maintain their livelihoods. The content generally states that the introduction ticket was created in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, each ticket merchant reported to the public in advance 12,000 taels of silver, and the government issued a license allowing them to forever handle transportation. After the restoration, the Qing system was still followed. Last year, the registration fee for ticket inspection was set, and the ticket merchants paid 4 million oceans, allowing them to remain the same. Now, the salt tax law reported in the Legislative Yuan states that salt is freely traded by the people, and the introduction merchant system will cease from the date of publication of the public notice. This is to implement on-site tax collection. When the news came, the ticket merchants were panicked, and various industries moved, fearing that once published, those who would cut off their livelihood would be more than millions of households. The introduction merchant system was a monopoly in the Qing Dynasty, but it has been transferred and has become a kind of reserve certificate. Many widows and orphans use it for their livelihood. Abolishing the introduction bank is tantamount to announcing the death penalty to millions of households.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The High Court Sends a Committee to Thoroughly Investigate the Black幕 of the Prison: A citizen of this county, so and so, filed a complaint with the Suzhou Higher Court about various black幕 of the prison and attached multiple copies of the local Huaihai Daily newspaper that published the news.

Magistrate Fu arrived in You this morning (8th) and immediately went to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Wang to discuss everything. He used a business card to send someone to invite Shi Wenjun, the manager of the Huaihai Daily newspaper, to the county government. He also summoned the prison guard captain and more than ten prisoners. Magistrate Fu opened the court, asked a few questions, and asked Mr. Shi to present several pieces of evidence of the black幕 of the prison in court. After the inquiry, he ordered everyone to sign the record. It is reported that Mr. Fu will return to Yangzhou tonight to report the truth to his superiors.</p>
<p>Two Robbery Felons are Executed by Firing Squad: Xu Kui, a detective of the 6th District of the Gaoyou Water Provincial Public Security Team, previously captured two robbery felons, Zhu Jihuai and Zhang Xiqing, in Qingjiang. They were immediately sent to the Yangzhou Pacification Superintendent's Office for interrogation. After several interrogations by the superintendent's office, they both admitted to robbing the Xifeng and Hengfeng small steamships of the Litong Company at the Qilizha place in Baoying County. Now the Superintendent's Office has sent the criminals back to the 6th District Department of Gaoyou to be escorted to the location of the incident for execution by firing squad. After receiving the order, District Chief Cheng immediately ordered the team to escort the two criminals to Qilizha for execution on the morning of the 7th.</p>

<h3>Various Schools Commemorate Martyrs Who Died in the Campaign Against the Rebels</h3>
<p>▲ Jinan University: National Jinan University held a memorial service for the martyrs who died in the campaign against the rebels in the auditorium at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. More than a thousand teachers and students attended. The service was presided over by Dean of Students Tang Demin, who reported the four purposes of the meeting: (1) This year, industry and commerce have gradually returned to their original state, politics has gradually gotten on track, and the majority of the people have been able to live and work in peace and contentment. This is all the price paid by the soldiers at the front who fought for the country and quelled the rebellion, regardless of their own safety. (2) Any country in the midst of a great revolution must rely on the sacrifice of countless soldiers before the national policy can be determined. The United States and France are examples of this. (3) After the European War, tens of thousands of ladies paid their respects and shed tears at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Europe on Memorial Day. This is because, after the pain subsided, they admired the unnamed soldiers who sacrificed for the nation and for peace. Their emotions are the same as our emotions when we should commemorate the soldiers who sacrificed for the unification and peace of the Chinese nation. In the future, the country will become more prosperous, and the people will enjoy the happiness bestowed by peace and progress. However, these soldiers who sacrificed for the country will no longer be mentioned in five or ten years. What are our feelings? (4) The Chinese nation has a deeply rooted love for peace, so opposition to war was the common view of the general public in the past. However, to eliminate war, there must be the strength to eliminate war. The martyrs who died in battle are loyal and brave men who would rather sacrifice their personal happiness, family, and life to eliminate the rebellion and achieve peace, and to create happiness for the new China. We must know that sacrificing oneself for the independence of the nation and the peaceful unification of the country is the greatest and most glorious thing. The martyrs who died in battle are truly our role models. Following this, Zhan Kui, Deputy Chairman of the University Affairs Council and Director of the Middle School Department, gave a speech, saying that the thorns in the future of the country have already been cleared by the martyrs who died in battle. In the future, the construction of all things must rely on the succession and efforts of young students. If they cannot bear the mission of construction, then they are all sinners against the fallen martyrs.</p>

President Wang served as the chief celebrant, and after the ceremony, he delivered a speech with extremely mournful words. The entire venue was solemn, and the music of mourning especially increased the tragic atmosphere. A funeral couplet was hung in front of the stage, reading: "The soldiers fought bravely, sharing the same hatred, vowing to kill the chief culprit. The eternal national殇 becomes a pain." "The red blood is mottled, in the nine heavens and nine earths, summoning the souls of many soldiers. The Yangtze River flows, sobbing with lingering sorrow." The memorial text and speech are omitted.</p>

<h3>Xiamen University Defeats Jiaotong University in Yesterday's Basketball Friendly Match</h3>
<p>▲ Twenty-Four to Seventeen Points</p>
<p>▲ Xiamen Military Flag Opens Victoriously</p>
<p>The Xiamen University basketball team from Fujian, led by Mr. Huang Bingkun, came to Shanghai to compete, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., the team played its first match against the Jiaotong University basketball team at the Jiaotong University gymnasium. The result was 24 to 17, with Xiamen University winning the opening match. A brief account is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Battle Situation Appears to be Dull</p>
<p>After the start of the match, the first half was extremely dull. The stalemate lasted for four or five minutes without any progress. Just as it was silent, Jiaotong University's Liu Liangzhan suddenly scored, opening the record. Xiamen University's Liu and Zhang, both forwards, also swiftly scored, taking the lead 4 to 2. Both teams were extremely dissatisfied. The first half ended with Xiamen University winning 8 to 4. From the beginning of the second half, the atmosphere gradually became tense, with both sides scoring alternately, breaking the dullness. Jiaotong University once closed the gap to just one point with a score of 13 to 14. Cheers erupted in the arena, and the spirit was greatly boosted. Unfortunately, Jiaotong University was once again left to be trampled on, while Xiamen University continued to score, resulting in a final score of 24 to 17, with Xiamen University winning.</p>
<h3>Guest Troops Have Fierce Characteristics</h3>
<p>The Xiamen team is brave and good at fighting. This is its characteristic. The ball skills can be further improved. The defensive methods seem to be able to be improved. Otherwise, fouls are a risk. It is still possible to beat Jiaotong University, but it is necessary to work hard to compete with other teams. Jiaotong University's connection is better, but the lack of confidence in throwing the ball is a pity.</p>

<h3>Recording the Wrongful Deaths of Two Women</h3>
<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>There are many people in the world who die unjustly. All epidemic and acute diseases have a way to be cured. However, due to the lack of attention to hygiene among the people and the lack of knowledge of medicine, an unknown number of people die unnaturally every year. A Mr. So-and-so from the West once wrote a paper on "True Death and Apparent Death," which gave many examples. It roughly stated that claw marks and disordered bones are often found in coffins. This is a clear sign of resurrection after apparent death. Therefore, if the body is not buried until twenty-four hours after death, it is often difficult to avoid the tragedy of being buried alive. This is not an ideal talk, it is actually very common. According to what I have heard, two women clearly died unjustly. I record them as a warning to others.</p>
<p>The wife of a neighbor, Yu, is very virtuous and loved by her in-laws. Her husband is a merchant in Hanzhong. She returned to her hometown to live during her pregnancy. The woman suffered from hemorrhoids and was in great pain when they flared up. Someone told her to apply borneol and honey to the anus, which would cure it immediately. The woman applied it as instructed. Unexpectedly, the baby could not stand the smell of borneol and suddenly surged upward, and the woman died. Her husband heard the news and returned home, weeping bitterly over the coffin, not wanting to live. Those who saw it shed tears for her. Isn't this a case of wrongful death due to a lack of medical knowledge? Those who abuse potent drugs should be warned.</p>
<p>The other day, there was a woman named A Ying on the street. She was twenty-three years old. She was still washing clothes in the river after breakfast. At dusk, she died of abdominal pain. I heard people talking about it and asked if she had any other illnesses. They replied that she only had abdominal pain from morning to night. I was afraid that an epidemic might break out in our town, so I didn't want to go to see her. Later, after detailed investigation, I learned that A Ying was from Fenghua and lived in our town. Because her husband was as useless as the second in the proverb, she had many lovers. One night, she had an affair with someone named Jia on the ground of a ruined temple and fled when she was seen. I then realized that this must have been typhoid fever that caused her death. It is a pity that I did not know the truth at the time, and A Ying's husband was as foolish as a deer or pig. The neighbors all avoided him as if he were a plague. Therefore, a romantic ghost was added to the city of wrongful deaths. Having witnessed these two events, I feel very sad. Regardless of my humble abilities, I took up my pen to record them as above.</p>
<h3>Words of Heartbreak</h3>
<p>— Someone</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Chengzhong's descendant, Zhongfang, is intelligent and outstanding, but unrestrained and unruly. He is known in Shanghai for his petty troubles. Recently, I don't know what major stimulation he received, but he left home and went elsewhere. Before leaving, he sent a letter to his beloved, Shirley, saying, "Now, as you wish, I have left home and ran away. The future is vast and I don't know where I will end up. Recalling the scenery of this day last year, who would have expected the sadness of this moment this year. Although Zhong has a heart, what can he do if you don't care. Zhong is leaving now. I hope you take care." Unexpectedly, this gentleman is also burdened by love. Reading his letter, although only a few words, the heartbreak is extreme. I wonder if that Shirley was also moved by it.</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting the "President Madison" by Various Universities</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The American Dollar Steamship Company has recently promoted its business and contacted the national sentiment. It specifically invited students from various universities to visit the "President Madison" on the sixth of this month through the YMCA. One hundred and fifty-one professors and students from various universities arrived. They departed at 2 PM and returned at 5 PM. There were many noteworthy things during this time, so I will describe one or two of them as follows.</p>
<p>▲Tension in the Air at the New Customs Wharf: When the company initially invited students from various universities, it was not limited to graduating classes. Later, the number of applicants increased dramatically. Taking Jiaotong University as an example, there were already 150 people. Subsequently, the company felt that the number of people was too large and decided to receive them in stages, first accommodating the senior students. These people will be graduating soon and are more concerned about the issue of going abroad. For a time, the new customs wharf was filled with candidate bachelors. Nine out of ten were wearing suits, laughing and talking, and the atmosphere gradually became tense.</p>
<p>▲No Space to Stand on the Ferry: The invitation from the company stated that they would meet at 1:50 PM. By 1:50 PM, the small ferry for receiving guests from the Dollar Company slowly arrived. It can be said that they kept their word. The boat was huge, but there was no space to stand up or down due to the large number of passengers. People in the company told each other that this was an unprecedented record for congestion. As the guests boarded the boat, it immediately set sail. At that time, more than ten people from Daxia University arrived by car and rushed to the wharf, but it was too late. All of them looked disappointed.</p>
<p>▲Welcoming Guests to Tour Freely: After arriving in Pudong, the "President Madison" was already in sight. The company staff respectfully invited the guests to board the boat and rest in the lounge. The arrangement of the ship was as luxurious as a first-class hotel in Shanghai, and it was even cleaner and more solemn. After entering the room, each person was given a piece of paper, instructed to write their name and school on it, and then put it on their lapel for identification. All parts of the ship were open, even the driver's room, where tourists were stopped, could be introduced and explained by a mechanic.</p>
<p>▲More Than Two Thousand Yuan for a Trip to the United States: The area of the ship is extremely large. It is divided into bedrooms, dance halls, dining rooms, writing rooms, and social rooms, all of which are extremely luxurious and look like a heavenly residence. The first-class room has two beds in the middle, and all other necessary items are available. When asked about the price to the United States, they said it required more than 480 US dollars, which is more than 2,000 Chinese dollars.</p>
<p>▲Tea and Snacks Fill the Room with Spring: At four o'clock, the crew invited all visitors to the dining room for tea. Although there were many people, the restaurant was quite large, so it was not too crowded. There were six people at each table, with two plates of pastries and toast. The hospitality can be said to be thoughtful. After the meal, the group went to the social room, where the YMCA representative, Mr. Haimuhua, gave a speech. He said that he was also a Chinese student. He was born in Suzhou, went to the United States for schooling when he grew up, and then returned to China. He then thanked the company for their hospitality. He occasionally mixed Suzhou dialect in his speech, which made the audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>▲Distributing Books and Saying Goodbye: The ship has many printed items. I was given more than thirty books by the company staff. Others also received several books each. Many of them are expensive photographs. The cost of printing is not small. The company's ability to attract customers can be seen from this. At five o'clock, we left the ship and said goodbye to the host.</p>
<p>▲Returning with the Waves, Also Students Abroad: On the way back, the students from each school told each other about the joy of this trip and said, "From now on, we are also students abroad." Mr. Haimuhua expressed his willingness to sincerely assist students from various universities in going abroad and planned to set up a discussion group so that students can participate together and study everything.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Crystal Mine Near Zhu Township</h3>
<p>— Wang Ri Sou</p>
<p>Yesterday, my friend Zhang came from Fuzhou and told me about the mining of crystal in the near Zhu Township of Mawei, which can be used as a topic of conversation. I will record it here to make the "Free Talk" real.</p>
<p>▲Finding a Mine While Building a Tomb: There is a mountain in the near Zhu Township of Mawei. It is said that there are many crystals in it, so it is named Crystal Mountain. However, the crystals are all deeply buried in the mountain. The mountain is big, so there is no way to mine it. Recently, a villager named Ren built a tomb for his ancestors, so he hired many workers to cultivate the cemetery he bought on Crystal Mountain. When they dug to eight or nine feet, they found many white stones. A worker with experience said that there must be crystals below. At that time, the owner did not know about it, so they warned each other not to reveal it.</p>
<p>▲Mining at Night: That night, the workers took advantage of the owner's ignorance and mined all night. At about three feet, they found many crystals. The matter was known to the villagers, and they came to negotiate. The workers said that the crystals were obtained by their own blood and sweat and should belong to them. However, the villager named Ren said that the land belonged to him and he must take back the crystals. The two sides were stubborn and almost came to blows. After mediation, they each divided half. At that time, they thought it was a rare commodity and refused to sell it. Later, because there was no place to sell it, they were willing to sell it at a low price. Mr. Zhang once bought a crystal for two gold coins.</p>
<p>▲Shape of the Crystal: Each crystal is as big as a Western melon, but the shape is a geometric polyhedron. The outside stone is white and not transparent. Mr. Zhang once broke a corner of it and realized that the inside was all transparent black crystal. The outer wrapping is only a very thick white stone skin. Some say that the crystal is all transparent and has no stone skin wrapping it. But then, this kind of crystal is not yet fully mature, or it is another kind of mineral.</p>
<h3>Jia'an's Fleeing from Painting</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Among paintings, flowers and plants are more difficult than landscapes and figures. The swing of the brush spontaneously has a spiritual appeal; each painting has its own color and fragrance. Otherwise, it can easily become broken branches or become too coarse and extensive. If the artist attempts to produce juxtaposed dense buds it becomes cumbersome and stagnant, and difficult to please. Among contemporary flower painters, Mr. Chen Zhemian of Haiyu is considered a giant. Mr. Chen lived in Wuzhong, near Yinmaqiao, and made a living by selling paintings. He was able to paint landscapes, figures, insects, fish, birds, and animals. He also wrote flowers and plants, which were light, graceful, and elegant. Without a model or draft, the stroke would follow his will, and have its own style. Those who sought a small picture or a large scroll would wear the threshold through. Mr. Chen would paint all year round, but still accumulate works like a mountain, and it was difficult to make up for the backlog. Mr. Chen also socialized widely, and friends came to chat. He was even more distracted by the art of painting. Unable to help himself, he would pack his painting equipment and escape to the Canglang Pavilion. He would mix lead and pigments and bury himself in his work. When sunset came, he would leisurely return, and even his family would not know where he came from. When Mr. Chen was tired of painting, he would often go to the Wu Yuan teahouse in Guanqian to relax. But the teahouse had many regular customers, and regular customers often asked for paintings. Paintings piled up for months or even years. When they saw Mr. Chen coming, they would surround him and urge him to pay his debt. Painting debt was worse than money debt. Mr. Chen could not cope and did not dare to go to the Wu Yuan teahouse for more than ten days. He often visited ancient sites in the suburbs, picking up old things at cold stalls, as a refuge for absconding. Children running away from school is what they have been used to hear. Mr. Chen flees from painting, is truly a strange tale in the art world, and can be laughed at. Mr. Chen was humorous and corpulent, resembling a Luohan. He was a model in the Leng Hong Society. Many people followed him to study painting. The novelist Cheng Xiaoqing and the younger brother of Yanqiao, Ji Qian, were all his disciples. I studied at Caoqiao School and was once bathed in his spring breeze.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (379)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: Having the Skills to Maintain Youth, Cui Dai Blends Eyebrows; Having No Way to Prolong Life, the Golden Market Races for Valiant Bones</p>
<p>That director was also from the South and was very sincere, but he was specifically inviting guests for Hua Lao Liu. He was an economist. He had calculated a little and thought that this gambling game was specially set up for Hua Lao Liu. The money drawn from the top could be said to be to support Hua Lao Liu. Even if the top money was not enough, if he won a little himself, he could make up a total of two or three thousand yuan, which would be a respectable amount. Who knew that things in the world often exceeded expectations? As a result, the host lost heavily. Not only did he lose everything, but he also lost all the top money. After everyone dispersed, the host felt very disappointed. Originally, Hua Lao Liu also knew that this gambling game was specially set up for him, and he felt very sorry. Not only did he not get any money himself, but he also dragged the host down, causing him to lose a large sum. He said that it was all his, Hua Lao Liu's, bad luck. Not only was he unlucky, but he also dragged others down. However, the host comforted him, saying that we gamblers win and lose all the time, it's not a big deal. You don't have to mind. He also signed a check for five hundred yuan for Hua Lao Liu, saying that he had kept him up all night and returned empty-handed, which would inevitably bring bad luck. In the next few days, my luck is not good. When my luck is better, I will think of a way for you. However, gamblers value superstition the most. Many people who are usually very open-minded have many superstitions when it comes to gambling. That director lost money, but he didn't blame himself. Instead, he blamed Hua Lao Liu. He thought that he had also supported the girls from the South before, someone so and so, and was very satisfied. He even won money himself. How could he lose so much today? Maybe she is a slow-witted person. No wonder her business is not good. She is probably going through a black period. Gamblers pay very close attention to red and black. Therefore, whenever there is gambling, they no longer call for Hua Yuan Chun's card. In addition, after spreading the word among many gambling friends, Hua Lao Liu could not find wealthy gamblers. Since he could not find wealthy gamblers, his city card gradually decreased. A month later, although Ye Tonghou came, he is now a businessman. The friends he knows are not first-class characters. But he couldn't ignore Hua Lao Liu's kindness, so he went to have a drink once and played a few games of cards. It was just ordinary socializing. Moreover, his branch is in Tianjin, and he often has to go to Tianjin. In a blink of an eye, Hua Yuan Chun had been in Beijing for more than half a year. However, his business did not improve much. When he had a little money, he couldn't save it. His original intention was to return to Shanghai when he had saved some money. But he could not fulfill his wish. The two good friends in Shanghai often wrote letters, plucking at his heartstrings, and he could not help but think of the red beans of Jiangnan. In this depressed mood, he suddenly fell ill.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Plummeting</h3>
<p>▲Sharply Down by 22 Taels</p>
<p>▲The Situation is Critical: Yesterday, March 10th, gold prices continued to plummet, and the situation was critical. It has already broken through the 710 tael mark, dropping by more than 22 taels. The changes throughout the day still amounted to 4 or 5 taels. Dealers were inclined to sell rather than buy. In the morning, companies such as Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan, Sheng Heng Xing, Yuan Zhi, and Feng Yong were all sellers, while buyers included the Dalian gang and Wu Pin, Yuan Heng, etc. The Guangdong gang sold and then bought back. As for the exchange rate, it was loose and discounted, and the quoted price increased by 2 levels. It is likely that silver markets overseas have all reported gains, so the full price opened low. The continuing weakness was due to the poor environment. It continued to plummet by 10 taels. The market outlook was complex, but buyers were not silent. The exchange rate was slightly eased, so the gold price turned upward slightly. However, there were times of rise and fall. Heng Xing sold heavily in the afternoon, the amount was huge, and it was from the dragon slips. In addition, the exchange rate was even looser, so the ancient price suddenly burst, and the torrential rain plummeted by more than 10 taels, suddenly falling to 706.7 taels. This morning, the big slips still need to rise. The spot raw slips only increased by 8 taels.</p>
<p>▲Opening Was Already Low: The market opened at 48 minutes past the hour in the morning at 715 taels, a decrease of 4 taels and 8 qian. As the big slips rose 16/5, the silver price increased 8/7, and there were many buyers. Private telegrams also increased 3/4, to 25 taels and a half. It was rumored that there was a slight earthquake in the neighboring coastal area, and the market declined slightly. However, Yuan Mao, Yong Heng Xing, etc. were selling, causing the price to gradually go downstream, sharply reducing it by 10 taels. Until the official opening, the quoted price was half a cent higher, with one US dollar and the Japanese gold reduced by 5.5 fen. At this time, the drop was 15 taels and a half. The domestic market was also loose. The April English gold could be settled at 1.3615. Suddenly, Wu Pin, etc. came to buy, and it was 19 taels. Qian Chang Xiang, Heng Xing Yuan, etc. suddenly sold, and Mai Hang offered 6875 for April-May English gold, so the gold price fell to 14 taels. After entering, Tong Tai Chang, etc. chased in, and the English gold returned to level, settling at only 5625, so it rose more than 6 taels. At 10:00, it was 20 taels and 5 qian, then downward. Retailers were selling, and head-set teams were also selling, falling again by 4 to 5 taels. From 10:15 to about 11:00, there were more than 2 taels of reversals. Soon after, Yuan Cheng Heng Xing Yuan, etc. sold out, and at 11:20, it was only 14 taels and 5 qian. Later, Ding Chang Yong Feng, etc. came to buy, and it rose again by 4 to 5 taels. At noon, it was 19 taels and 1.2 qian, and at the closing, it was 18 taels and 1 qian. It continued to fall to 16 taels, and the head-set team sold. During the break, it rose again by 2 taels, for a total of 18 taels. In reality, people's hearts were flustered and uncertain. The Yang price had been changed to 71 taels, with a premium of 50 to 52-3 taels.</p>
<p>▲State of Collapse in the Afternoon Market: The afternoon market opened at 18 taels and a half, then 19 taels. Heng Xing Sheng Da, etc. sold in droves, and the Indian exchange rate rose, so the price plummeted, almost like splitting bamboo. The English gold was also loose and flooded. Japanese banks, etc. all sold, calculated at 563, etc. and 1.36875 for the month, so the gold price plummeted by 10 taels, falling to 708 taels and a half at 2:30. Afterwards, it seemed to turn flat slightly, because sellers retreated, and Fu Chang, etc. bought, so in half an hour it returned to more than 6 taels, and at 3:00 it was 15 taels. Afterwards, the selling wind still did not stop. Heng Xing Zhi Feng Yong, etc. continued to sell heavily, and the exhausted state plummeted by more than two taels. At 4:15, it suddenly became 706 taels and a half. At the time, English gold could be settled at 1.375. However, colleagues changed their positions to plug up losses. Later, retailers chased in, pulling up 4 taels in an instant, to 10 taels and 5 qian. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 707 taels and 8 qian, a continuation of the more than 22 tael drop from the day before. The maximum price throughout the day was 25 taels and a half, and the minimum price was 06 taels and a half, a difference of 19 taels. Wu Pin's morning market was 25 taels, the afternoon closing was 16:00, and the afternoon was 18 taels and 5. The closing price was 09 taels. The listed price was calculated at a premium of 52-3 taels to 63-4 taels. The booked amount was 11 taels to 18 taels in the morning, and 04 taels to 11 taels in the afternoon. The supplemental amount was 11 taels, and 04 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲The Selling Sentiment is Stronger Than Ever: The transactions of each company, including Zhi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Yuan Cheng Yong, Yuan Tai, Yuan Cheng, and Heng Xing Yuan, were all sales. Heng Xing, Qian Chang Xiang, etc. sold first and then bought. Yuan Mao Yong also sold. Shun Li, Wan Xing, Fu Chang, Wu Pin, etc. bought more and sold less. Yuan Heng, Ding Chang, and Chun Yuan Yong all bought. In the afternoon, Heng Xing and Sheng Da sold more. The total number of slips was more than 7,000. Yuan Mao Yong, Cheng Feng Yong, Fu Tai Heng, Yuan Tai, and Nei Xing all sold. Yu He and Zhi Feng Yong sold to different people. Shun Li, Wan Xing, Fu Chang, and Wu Pin, Tong Tai Chang, etc. all bought. The Dalian gang bought more than 3,500 slips and sold a total of 1,600-700 slips.</p>

As a result, compared to the previous day, the English gold increased by 4.375, the US dollar increased by 8.125, and the Japanese gold fell by 4 fen.

<h3>Continued Sluggishness in the Securities and Bond Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's bond market conditions showed futures becoming increasingly sluggish compared to the past. Both the morning and afternoon trading sessions were extremely quiet.

Spot trading was even more deserted than before, with only 5,000 yuan traded throughout the day. The trend in bond prices was stable due to the low trading volume and balanced supply and demand, resulting in a particularly stagnant price. Overall, prices were slightly weaker than the previous day, with changes generally limited to a few jiao, creating an unusual situation of stability rarely seen recently. The bond market situation has once again become more moderate.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market is Trending Towards Softness</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak and declining. This is due to the extended exchange rate, falling gold prices, and a consistently downstream situation in overseas cotton yarn markets. Spot yarn sales in the market are very slow, and all groups show no signs of activity. However, the mood of a certain major merchant remains strong, with no intention of loosening. Currently, prices have fallen by twelve to thirteen taels compared to their peak. If customer sales can improve, there is hope for a turnaround. Otherwise, the market will remain in a state of fluctuation. Most people are watching for a price level of around 65 taels.</p>
<p>▲People's Standard Declining: The opening of the People's Standard market was very loose due to the continued decline in American cotton and the extended silver price. Buyers were scarce, and prices fell by 6.9 qian to 1 liang. It was observed that major traders were still entering the market. In the afternoon, news that the gold price was only over 710 taels further weakened sentiment. Those who shorted made slight profits. Ultimately, prices fell by 4, 5, 6, and 7 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 36,300 bales. Sales included 1,250 bales by He Shen, 1,750 bales by Geng Feng, 1,350 bales by Rui Da, 1,650 bales by Shen Ji, 1,100 bales by Fu He, and 1,610 bales by Chang Feng. Purchases included 1,150 bales by Tian Long, 1,900 bales by Yi Yu, 1,300 bales by Sheng Tai, 1,400 bales by Xin Cheng, and 950 bales by Yong Da. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Prices | Change | Account Balance</p>
<p>March 1650 Down 15 22,200</p>
<p>June 1681 Down 16 31,700</p>
<p>April 1668 17 32,300</p>
<p>July 1683 10 18,25</p>
<p>May 161 14 32,710</p>
<p>August 1682 2 10,950</p>
<p>▲Sluggish Yarn Sales: Spot yarn sales are increasingly slow, but futures trading is remarkably active. Foreign firms purchased 1,170 bales in the market, customer groups only purchased 200 bales, 90 bales entered from inland areas, 25 bales from Shantou, 10 bales from Xiamen, 5 bales from Ningbo, and 5 bales from Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton market is quiet, with silver prices rising and exchange rates extending, while overseas cotton markets are also weak. This has led to a looser calculation and a shortage of buyers. The spot cotton business of various factories is deserted. Japanese merchants, viewing the poor global cotton market, are continuously releasing their long positions. However, the underlying inventory is thin, and the future depends on the exchange rate and Indian cotton.</p>
<p>▲Empty Hankou Standard: The opening of the Hankou Standard market was disheartened due to the continued decline in American cotton and the rising silver price. Prices fell by 1 qian to 2.5 qian across the board. The market remained weak in the afternoon, as the gold price fell again. The final closing prices were slightly higher, resulting in a decline of 1.5 qian to 2.5 qian for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 87,100 dan. Sales included 6,100 dan by Chang Feng, 2,700 dan by Shen Chang, 2,000 dan by Yi Chang, 3,200 dan by Geng Feng, 2,000 dan by Tian Long, and 2,600 dan by Ji Feng. Purchases included 6,100 dan by Gong Tai, 4,100 dan by Yuan Feng, 4,500 dan by Shen Da, 2,400 dan by Mei Ji, and 2,800 dan by Yi Yu. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>May 4140 Down 30 70,300</p>
<p>March 4160 Down 35 50,700</p>
<p>June 4130 35 75,100</p>
<p>April 4130 5 58,500</p>
<p>July 4130 40 58,700</p>
<p>▲Weak Real Demand: Spot cotton transactions are becoming increasingly dull. The source is estimated to be 100 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 43.00 2.75 Da Feng Factory received 900 pieces of spot goods to be sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton are Dull and Lifeless</h3>
<p>▲American Cotton Declines: Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to purchases by fellow traders, but weakened later due to sales in New Orleans and profit-taking by long positions. Futures fell by 6 to 10 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 9 to 10 points, and spot prices rose by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton weakened due to poor news from Liverpool, but Japanese merchants made some purchases. Nagpur and Broach both rose by 2 rupees, Oomra rose by 4 rupees, and distant deliveries rose by 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (9th telegram):</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Gradually Rising Due to Scarcity</h3>
<p>▲Zhabei: Yesterday, the amount of goods arriving from the loss route was still scarce. Sales within this street are brisk. The market for white japonica rice continues to be good, with both wholesale and retail prices rising by about two jiao. Customer demand for early indica rice is eager, but the arrival of goods is sparse, also tightening the price. Sales of Yangxian rice are brisk, with prices rising by about one jiao. Customer demand for Dujian and Jianbu rice from the place of origin is increasingly dry. Moreover, Anhui province has special relationships, increasing costs, so the local price here is very firm, rising by more than one chi. The arrival and sale of Baiyuan rice are even, without much profit or loss.</p>
<p>▲Hu Nan: Yesterday, the amount of goods arriving from customer groups was not high, and the sales market in this street was quite good. Changshu, Xitong, and Sutong white japonica rice continued the momentum from the previous day and the popularity of the price猛Ang by two to three jiao, with a lively overall trend. The market situation for early indica rice in the South is also entrusted to Ningbo and the price is high. There were frequent inquiries for retail sales, with prices steadily increasing by two jiao. The sales of Hua Dujian rice were brisk, and the arrival of goods was also scarce, so the price increased by jiao ban. The buying mood for Bianyin rice was calm, and the market price remained high and stable.</p>
<h3>Continued Rise in Northern Sales of Ke Yuan Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for Ke Xian rice continued to see customer demand. Gangmian gangs, in view of the situation in the place of origin, became more determined in their thinking. Not only did they insist on not dropping prices, but they also purchased as prices rose, so even though there was no customer influence, the footing was already very stable. Yesterday, 700 bags of late Jiangxi machine rice opened at a price of 12 yuan and 8 jiao to 12 yuan and 7 jiao ban, and 800 bags of Hunan machine Shan rice opened at a price of 12 yuan and 6 jiao, all of which were recovered by the group households. The stock of Ke Yuan rice was small, and high prices were especially rare. The appetite of those who bring in goods was very keen, and they only regretted that there were no high-quality goods to handle. Yesterday, the Beiyang Gang purchased 52 bags of Jiangxi machine Yuan rice at a price of 14 yuan and 4 jiao ban, which was another rise of one jiao compared to the previous market, it was said.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms: A Quiet Silk Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local Shanghai foreign silk market remained quiet. The overseas arrival prices of Shanghai white factory silk were still low, and the cost of production for small factories remained high. With a difference of two to three hundred taels per bale, sales were difficult. Yesterday, only 10 bales of dry silk were received by Baili Yanghang from the Shanghai Yue Factory, 10 bales of fine dry silk were received by Qianli, and 12 bales of coarse yellow silk were received by Samsung. The prices were all flat and weak, it was said.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Satin is Selling Well and Prices are Rising</h3>
<p>Silk satin, known as "Luo Duan Xing Zhi," has been popular for three years. The opening price this spring was 4 taels and 2 qian ban. Buyers all made purchases, and stores on this street were particularly eager to receive goods. Recently, demand has been especially strong, and the market is tight. Sellers have raised selling prices. Yesterday, the wholesale price for goods from Changsheng, Rongtai, Dafeng, Lihe, and other brands was uniformly raised to 4 taels and ban. The retail price per chi in stores was 1 yuan and 4 jiao ban.</p>
<h3>Metals: Metals Gradually Showing Signs of Softness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the metals market saw a softening trend. The increasing exchange rate reduced the cost of various goods, thus the market sentiment was softening, and the standards for each market were also trending lower. Tungsten white iron, tinplate, new lead wire, British steel plate, etc., all fell. However, transactions were very sparse. It was found that only old iron, French nails, tungsten white iron, and tinplate were sold yesterday. Other goods rarely had any transactions. Regarding the arrival of goods, however, it is currently quite prosperous. Yesterday, over 700 bundles of new lead wire, over 130 sheets of British steel plate, 4,900 bars of blue lead, 20,000 sheets of tungsten white iron, 50 tons of purple steel, and several thousand bundles of white iron were received. In addition, large quantities of tinplate, angle iron, white lead sheet, etc., were also loaded, but the Shanghai stock was lean, so there was no fear of the market being full of goods.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated White Sugar Plummets by 2 Qian Ban</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market telegrams from the production areas reported that Cuban spot sugar prices did not rise or fall. New York sugar futures for March rose by three points compared to the previous session, and May and September also rose by four points each. Javanese spot sugar remained unchanged. Sugar futures for April fell by 125, with the new price for May at 8.250. The public association market settlement showed that Dutch sugar number 24 coarse granulated white, due to sluggish real sales, had a sharp fall in the auction price. With the continuous increase in the exchange rate, the market sentiment was even weaker, and there were no inquiries. Initially, the seller's side still thought about struggling, calling out a price of 10 taels and 7 qian, but the buyer's side all shook their heads and ignored it. In the end, the auctioneer Nan Shenglong offered 2,000 bags, and the price fell to 10 taels and 5 qian. Buyers gradually became active, and the trend was slightly stable. Number 20 grade A granulated white was at 10 taels and 1 qian, but the receiving side was also quiet. The Japanese sugar transaction was even quieter, and the market also plummeted. The transaction price for YP reached 10 taels and 6 qian ban, and YT grade was at 10 taels and 4 qian ban, with a particularly flat trend. Taikoo Cart Sugar, with 5,000 bags of R grade to be shipped in April and May, opened at a price of 4 yuan and 5 jiao per day gold, with new regulations and taxes added. The Hong Kong side has already been telegraphed and is awaiting a response for confirmation.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Black Melon Seeds are Actively Moving</h3>
<p>Black melon seeds have recently shown a firm and stable trend, and the market is very active for all groups. Sales from the Shantou gang are the best. Transactions also occur in the Han and Min provinces, as well as the local street in the inland. Therefore, the auctioning and offering of prices is also very lively. Since the market opened, approximately 20,000 outer packages have been transacted, with transaction prices ranging from 16 taels to 9 taels and 6-7 qian. Yesterday's market 行盘 sellers, such as Jikuizi, sold at 16 taels, Jizhongzi at 13 taels and 7 qian, Dangshanzi at 12 taels, and Xukuizi at 11 taels and ban, followed by around 10 taels.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt Takes Off Suddenly</h3>
<p>▲Rising by More Than Four Taels in Half a Month</p>
<p>Before the closing of accounts, the situation for asphalt was peaceful. However, after the closing of accounts, it suddenly took off, with the market taking off suddenly. In just half a month, it rose by more than four taels, a rare spectacle since the market opened. The reason is that the various production areas in Northwest Hubei suffered a definite 20% reduction in harvest last year, which has not been seen in nearly 20 years. As a result, when the spring sales were about to begin, there were no goods to supply. The market situation changed abruptly. According to the details in yesterday's letter from Hankou, heavily judged products have already sold for 19 taels and 3-4 qian, and Qianping Macheng oil also requires 19 taels. The source is extremely scarce. Those who are looking to procure goods are coming one after another. The later situation will not improve. The spring market has changed to such an extent, which was completely unimaginable. It is not possible to predict what process will be taken in the future to increase to what extent. It can be said to be a new era not seen in the open market. The price of Zhilu Pingnei oil has also reached beyond 30 yuan per stone at the Hangzhou exchange. The Jiaxing people in this province are even more unique, and selling in Shanghai must not be less than 31 yuan. Moreover, the existing stock in the entire production area is only slightly over 3,000, so scarcity makes it even more expensive. The existing Shanghai firms were not very thick when the accounts were settled. They were hoping to purchase a batch from Hankou after the settlement. Unexpectedly, the Hankou market had no stock, so it was unable to supply the buying households, resulting in a collective regret. The Shanghai firms were even more disappointed. It is said that several of them still have large short positions that have not been covered, so the losses are even more unbearable. Therefore, it can be said that the Shanghai market has no inventory at all, and the selling price has already been increased. Each firm only has goods to sell.</p>

After receiving the central government's telegram, the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Department immediately sent personnel to actively prepare in conjunction with the Garrison Command, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and others. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, it convened people from all walks of life at the West Gate Public Sports Field to hold the city's memorial service for fallen soldiers. At the same time, it notified all citizens of the city to wear black gauze armbands for one day and to stop banquets and entertainment for one day. Starting yesterday, all organs, groups, and schools raised their flags at half-mast for three days. At 8:00 a.m., the Navy fired 33 artillery rounds, and all factories in the city sounded their whistles three times to express mourning. In addition, various organs, party departments at all levels, groups, and schools held separate memorial services. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>▲ Eulogies from Various Sectors: On this, the tenth day of March in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Songhu Garrison Command, and all circles of Shanghai, with the deepest sorrow, offer this eulogy before the spirits of the fallen soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army who died in the suppression of the rebellion, saying: Alas, the wind is mournful, the sun scorching, the sky gloomy, and the ghosts weeping. Since ancient times, it has been thus; what remedy is there? In the past, warmongers treated war as a game. There were only sacrifices, but no guiding principles. Only our righteous army, with aspirations for revolution, united in hatred against the enemy, rose up with thunderous speed. Emerging from Lingnan and the coast, they struck directly at Yanyou, unifying the land before a year had passed. Punishing the guilty and comforting the people, tracing back to Tang and Wu, once they donned their armor, blood flowed so profusely it could float pestles. Heaven and earth are not benevolent; metal and stone evolve. Killing people like cutting hemp, no longer with mere sticks and blades, but with smoke, bullets, and rain, flesh and blood flying in all directions. Disregarding their own safety, they crushed the stubborn enemy. With one heart and mind, unwavering in the face of danger, valuing purpose over life, honoring name over existence. Cold rises from the Yi River, and the brave soldiers do not return. Great indeed are the national martyrs, heavier than Mount Tai. The whales and giant sea creatures have been sealed away, and the apes and cranes have transformed. Sprinkle your azure blood to support this Chinese land. Bows and swords move on their own, killing brigands as if hearing their commands. Even in death, they can still fight. Such is their spirit. The old capital has been recovered, and great disasters have been quelled. A joyous drink from the Yellow Dragon Cup, may it comfort your loyal souls. Alas, so many heroes, the elite of the Party and the nation. The whole world mourns; though dead, you live on. Slowly waving flags and banners, lingering drums of war, recalling your valor and sacrifice, tears fall like rain. From all directions, we gather, offering clean hearts and fragrant incense. May your departed spirits not be far away, but come to partake and enjoy this offering. ▲ Mayor Zhang's Speech: What day is today? It is the day to commemorate the fallen soldiers who died suppressing the rebellion. Recalling that since the National Revolutionary Army advanced to the Yangtze River and established its capital in Nanjing, it has been five or six years, during which countless hardships and numerous fierce battles were endured before achieving today's success in unification. Now, the whole country is united, and the foundation of the nation is gradually secure. The future is bright and just beginning to flourish. But tracing back to how we achieved this newly emerging situation, we cannot but say that it is the result of the struggle of the revolutionary heroes on the battlefield. During the period of military administration, the emphasis was on fighting against evil forces, and the figures who fought against these forces relied on all the revolutionary heroes on the battlefield. Therefore, since the suppression of the rebellion, the soldiers at the front lines, upholding the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and following the teachings of the late Premier, advanced one after another, striving bravely to be the first, sacrificing countless heads and shedding countless amounts of blood to construct this newly emerging nation. Then, we, who live in peace and think of danger, reflecting on the past and remembering the present, how can we not feel sorrow and longing for the spirit of the soldiers who sacrificed themselves in suppressing the rebellion over the years? The prosperity of a nation or the unification of a country cannot be achieved by a single throw of a hand or a single step of a foot, and even less can it be achieved in a year or six months, or by the strength of one or two people. If we want the prosperity of the nation and the unification of the country, there must be a cost involved. What is the so-called cost? It is sacrifice. Sacrifice is a necessary condition before a cause can succeed. This is true of all undertakings, and especially true of revolutionary undertakings. If we want to eliminate evil forces, there must be what is called struggle, and in the process of struggle, there cannot but be the cost of sacrifice. Similarly, if we want to build a new country, we must consume countless amounts of spiritual and material resources, and this kind of consumption can also be called sacrifice. Therefore, in the first half of the revolution, there must be the sacrifice of fighting against evil forces, and in the second half of the revolution, there must be spiritual and material sacrifices in building a new country. Today, tracing the special merits of the fallen soldiers who suppressed the rebellion, they were indeed the ones who undertook the complete work of the first half of the revolutionary history. If we do not fight against evil forces, then evil forces cannot be eliminated, and the opportunity to build a new country will never come. Therefore, all the new emerging opportunities of today are bestowed by the sacrifices of the fallen soldiers who suppressed the rebellion. Living in the present and thinking about the situation of the soldiers sacrificing themselves on the battlefield at that time, as the ancients said, each one was worth ten, their shouts shook the heavens, their livers and brains smeared the central plains, their blood and marrow covered the wild grass, risking death without hesitation, all these are true portraits of the fallen soldiers. Alas, forgetting the past is betraying the future. Since the work of sacrifice and struggle of the soldiers was so great and difficult, how can we not rise up and pursue it, striving to devote our heart and strength to the Party and the nation to comfort the spirits of the soldiers in the netherworld? Moreover, even more importantly, if we want to commemorate or remember the fallen soldiers, we should not only conduct formal commemorations and remembrances, but also continue their spirit of sacrifice. As mentioned earlier, the fallen soldiers undertook the work of the first half of the revolutionary history, but the work of the second half of the revolutionary history, the so-called work of building a new country, has not yet been completed. Therefore, we know that our responsibility today is to unite and work together to undertake the great responsibility of building a new country, following the path shown by the Three Principles of the People, following all the teachings of the late Premier, regardless of the degree of spiritual and material sacrifice, gradually step by step, to complete the ultimate goal of building a new country. If we are truly like this, then we will be able to commemorate the spirit of sacrifice of the fallen soldiers who suppressed the rebellion forever, and the new country under the Three Principles of the People will perhaps have a day of complete realization soon.</p>
<p>▲ Navy Commemorative Meeting: Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM,</p>
<p>the First Fleet Command of the Navy gathered all personnel from the naval vessels stationed in Shanghai and all agencies stationed in Shanghai at the Naval Headquarters Auditorium in front of Gaochang Temple to hold a commemorative ceremony. The ceremony was presided over by First Fleet Commander Chen Weiliang, with Staff Officer Zheng Shizhang as the master of ceremonies. The ceremony was performed according to the prescribed rituals. First, the chairman gave a speech, stating briefly: Today we commemorate the fallen soldiers who suppressed the rebellion, which is not the same as ordinary commemorations. We must (1) take the spirit of sacrifice of the soldiers who suppressed the rebellion as our spirit to implement the Three Principles of the People; (2) fulfill the unfinished aspirations of the fallen soldiers and support the constitutional government construction of the National Government; (3) thoroughly eliminate the reactionaries who harm the Party and the country and destroy the National Revolution. This is the meaning of today's commemoration and can comfort the spirits of the fallen soldiers who suppressed the rebellion in heaven. Next, guests gave speeches, full of sorrow and solemnity. Furthermore, starting from the tenth, all ships lowered their flags to half-mast for three days to express mourning.</p>

After the meeting began, the chairman led the attendees in respectfully reading the late Premier's will, then bowed three times to the memorial tablets of the fallen soldiers and observed three minutes of silent mourning. Next, the chairman presented flowers and respectfully read the eulogy. The chairman then reported on the significance of commemorating the fallen soldiers and introduced Captain Tóng, who gave a speech about personally following President Jiǎng to the front lines to suppress the rebellion and witnessing the tragic state of soldiers being injured and killed by artillery fire while bravely fighting to eliminate harm for the country and kill bandits (the speech was long, so it has been omitted). Afterwards, guests such as Corps Leader Xǔ gave speeches one after another, full of sorrow, bringing tears to the eyes of the listeners. The ceremony concluded at noon.</p>
<p>▲ Three Courts Suspend Hearings: Yesterday, in commemoration of the fallen soldiers who suppressed the rebellion, the Shanghai District Court received an order from the Ministry to suspend operations for one day. Therefore, yesterday, litigants and others were notified and flags were flown at half-mast to express mourning. However, since summonses had already been issued in the past few days, litigants who arrived at court yesterday for hearings all returned in disappointment.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jiangsu High Second Branch Court and the Special District Local Court had not received an order from the Ministry in advance to suspend operations, so no public announcement was made. It was not until 4:00 PM the day before yesterday that they received an order from the Ministry to suspend operations for one day to express mourning. They immediately posted a notice at the front gate to inform the public. However, due to the limited time, the lawyers and parties involved in the cases scheduled for trial the next day were not notified. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the lawyers arrived at the court with their briefcases, taking cars to court. When they arrived at the courthouse door, they saw that the double doors were tightly closed. After inquiring, they learned that the court was closed, so they all dispersed.</p>
<p>▲ Entertainment Venues Closed: All entertainment venues in the Chinese-controlled areas, such as the Gengxin Stage in Zhabei, the Zhabei Cinema, the Little World in the city, the Fangbanqiao Republican Cinema, as well as tea houses and storytelling venues in the Chenghuang Temple Yuyuan Garden and outside the city, were notified yesterday morning by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to their respective districts to dispatch police to inform them to suspend performances for one day to express mourning.</p>

<h3>He Jiwu's Account of the Wuchang Incident</h3>
<p>▲ Steps in the Development of China National Aviation Corporation</p>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram from Jiujiang reported that the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) aircraft "Wuchang" crashed in Xunyang, but the passengers were unharmed. A journalist from the Guowen News Agency visited He Jiwu, the General Manager of CNAC, to inquire about the details and the company's recent situation. He Jiwu informed him of the following details and the company's recent status.</p>
<p>▲ The Wuchang Aircraft had sustained minor damage in Hankou, so the three passengers had already refunded their tickets in Hankou and were not on board. The aircraft was only being flown empty to Shanghai for repairs. At 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, while passing through Jiujiang, it was hit by wind and the fuselage fell. It immediately stopped in Jiangxi. Fortunately, the navy warship Weisheng sent a艇 to rescue it. The aircraft was transported to Shanghai by the Taikoo Company's Whangpoo轮 and has now been sent to the Longhua Aircraft Factory for repairs. The pilot, Zhou Huang, also arrived in Shanghai at the same time.</p>
<p>▲ Inspecting various air stations: Mr. He himself had taken a flight from Shanghai on the 6th of this month (last Friday) to inspect the airfields in Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, and Hankou, and urged improvements in the equipment at each station. On the 9th, he returned to Shanghai on the Jiujiang aircraft.</p>
<p>▲ Company's plans: The company's current plan is to first extend the Shanghai-Chengdu line to Yichang, then start the Beijing-Ping (Beiping) air route, then extend the Shanghai-Chengdu line to Chongqing, then start the Shanghai-Guangdong air route, and finally complete the Shanghai-Chengdu air route directly to Chengdu. These are the steps in the plan.</p>
<p>▲ Developing the Shanghai-Chengdu line: As for the detailed arrangements for each route, the Shanghai-Chengdu line can fly from Hankou to Yichang on the 16th of this month. A pontoon (i.e., a停机标志) is being installed on the river surface in Shashi between Hankou and Yichang. It should be completed by the 23rd of this month, and then it will be able to land at each station. Within three months, it will be able to fly to Chongqing. Because the air pressure in Sichuan is slightly different from that in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the company's existing single-engine aircraft cannot fly safely. It has now ordered two twin-engine aircraft from the United States, worth approximately 45,000 US dollars. The transportation from Chengdu to Chongqing is more convenient than from Chongqing to Hankou, so it is okay to fly there slightly later.</p>
<p>▲ Beijing-Ping mail: The Beijing-Ping line was originally planned to start flying on the 15th of this month, but because the Jinan air station has not yet been completed and the radio has not yet been installed, the date has been postponed to April 1st for the official opening. The Xuzhou radio will be able to communicate with Shanghai within a few days. Nie Kaiyi flew a trial flight to Beiping and is now in Tianjin. He can return to Shanghai within a week. The company's original contract with the post office was for domestic mail to be transported by the company. Now the Ministry of Communications has revised the contract so that the Beijing-Ping line remains the same, but the route from Shanghai directly to the Northeast is now transported by Eurasia Aviation Corporation.</p>
<p>籌辦滬粤綫: The Shanghai-Guangdong line can be completed in about six months, passing through Ningbo, Wenzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and then Guangzhou. It is planned to take two days to fly there. Twin-engine aircraft have also been ordered. Initially, four aircraft will be needed to fly back and forth. The installation of radio equipment along the stations is currently being planned. The order for these aircraft will be placed after the twin-engine aircraft flying from Shanghai to Chongqing have arrived.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng Welcomed Zhu Qinglan the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>▲ Appealing for the Disaster Victims of Shaanxi on the Spot</p>
<p>▲ Donations of Over 60,000 Yuan in Two Hours</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Shaanxi is extremely severe, as is known throughout the country. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao is running around and appealing for disaster relief in Shaanxi, doing his utmost to raise funds. This time, he came to Shanghai. The two philanthropists Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng in the local area expressed great sympathy for Mr. Zhu's appeal for the disaster victims. Therefore, on the 9th of this month, they held a dinner party at their private residence on Avenue Haig to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Zhu and invited gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life to accompany them. More than a hundred people attended that day, including Gu Shaochuan, Qian Xinzhi, and Zheng Yuxiu. At that time, Zhang Xiaolin stood up and gave a speech, saying briefly, "Today, after hearing Mr. Zhu talk about the severity of the disaster in Shaanxi, I was shocked to learn that even the bark of trees and the roots of grass have been eaten clean, and even people are eating people. The tragedy of the disaster is unprecedented. If you don't believe it, please watch the film brought by Mr. Zhu, which will prove it. Therefore, today, although we are holding a banquet to welcome Mr. Zhu, we are also appealing for the disaster victims. Please, everyone, help as you can and donate generously. I respectfully bow nine times for the disaster victims to thank you." Then Zhu Ziqiao reported on the situation he personally experienced in the disaster area and screened the film he brought. All the guests were moved by the scenes in the film. Next, Gu Shaochuan, Zheng Yuxiu, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, and others gave speeches one after another, recounting the severity of the disaster in Shaanxi. If they were of the same species, no one would not have felt a sense of grief and pain. They asked all the people in attendance to open their wallets to help and to promote the cause widely in order to gather the smallest of efforts and create boundless blessings. During the banquet, some people even covered their faces and wept, showing how powerful the film and speeches were in moving people. After the banquet, Zhang and Du appealed to the guests for donations. In just two hours, the donations reached 61,020 yuan.

<h3>Silk Factory Industry Submits Petition to Change Silk Industry Bond Amount</h3>
<p>▲ Representative Chu Fucheng Goes to Beijing for Second Petition</p>
<p>The silk factory industry in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai sent Chu Fucheng, their second petition representative, to Beijing yesterday with a written petition regarding the silk industry bond issue. He took the 2:50 PM special express train. Representative Wang Xiaolai, due to personal matters, departed this morning (the 11th) on an early express train. The original text of the petition to the National Government is reproduced below.</p>
<p>Regarding the petition for approval to issue silk industry bonds, failing to provide relief, resulting in an excessive burden, requesting the maintenance of the original bond amount, and amending the regulations. We, the silk factory industry of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, due to the decline of the silk market, are on the verge of bankruptcy. We have appealed for the issuance of silk industry bonds for relief and have received approval to issue bonds worth 8 million yuan, with 6 million yuan for short-term relief to silk merchants and 2 million yuan for long-term fundamental improvement of sericulture. Subsequently, we read in the newspaper that the Legislative Yuan has amended the regulations for the 1931 Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Bond, setting the amount at 6 million yuan, with one-third for rewarding raw silk exports, one-third for improving silk factory machinery, and one-third for improving sericulture. From the date of issuance, the Jianghai Customs will collect a special tax of 22.5 yuan per dan on raw silk exports as a fund for repaying the principal and interest, to be repaid in seven years and six months. The manufacturers believe that the relief obtained is minimal and the responsibilities are excessive, which will not alleviate the current emergency but will leave future worries. Therefore, representatives were publicly elected to go to Beijing to state the facts and request changes, hoping to gain insight from your esteemed court (ministry). We believe that the silk factory industry in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai suffered overall losses last year and found it difficult to maintain operations. Apart from a few who obtained accommodation from the silver and money industry, accepting mortgaged dry cocoons and borrowing to start operations, most have stopped operations to await relief. In January of this year, the price once increased sharply, reaching 1,080 taels per dan, but within a few days, it fell back to less than 1,000 taels. However, the cost of raw materials is 950 taels, various labor costs are 250 taels, and interest, profit sharing, insurance, and warehouse rent are 100 taels, totaling at least 1,300 taels. Therefore, each dan of silk must lose more than 300 taels. Without adequate relief, not only will most silk factories be forced to close, but the loss of this sales channel during the new cocoon season will have a significant impact on farmers' livelihoods and social finance. Therefore, even if the relief measures cannot be fully adequate, they must allow room for turnover. This is the first reason for requesting a change in the bond amount. As for improving machinery, it is indeed an important goal. However, the Italian reeling machines commonly used for Chinese silk are not fundamentally unsuitable. Foreign sales are mainly to the United States and France, and France still enjoys using silk reeled by Italian machines. The reason why it cannot compete with Japanese silk is that management rights cannot be effectively implemented and workers do not accept guidance. Reeling machines for silk were originally created in Italy, and because their products are used by European and American buyers, there has been no change to this day. Based on this, the improvement of machinery is not urgent. Furthermore, most silk factories rent their factories, and the machinery is owned by the landlord as equipment with the house. Even if we want to reform them, our government can order the landlords to gradually renovate them. However, there are facts that cannot be ignored. Once the machinery is changed, its manufacturing methods will naturally be different. It is not possible to train tens of thousands of female workers to master the technology overnight. This is the second reason for requesting a change in the bond amount. After repeated consultations, we can only rely on your esteemed court (ministry) to understand the critical situation of the silk factory industry, approve the change in allocation, maintain the original bond amount of 8 million yuan, with 6 million yuan for relief to silk merchants and 2 million yuan for improving sericulture, and consult the Legislative Yuan to amend the regulations for promulgation and release the silk merchants from their urgent plight. In addition to this petition, we hereby submit this petition, requesting your examination and implementation, and await your order with utmost urgency. Committee of the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association, Committee of the Wuxi County Silk Factory Industry Association, Preparatory Committee of the Zhejiang Silk Factory Federation, respectfully presented.</p>
<h3>County Party Organization Rectification Committee and County Government Jointly Hold Memorial Meeting for the Anniversary of the Passing of Sun Yat-Sen</h3>
<p>March 12th is the sixth anniversary of the passing of Sun Yat-Sen. The Shanghai County Party Organization Rectification Committee originally planned to hold a memorial ceremony at the Dingzhuanqiao Farmers' Education Center. However, because the county government was holding its ceremony at 10:00 AM that day at Beiqiao Elementary School in Beiqiao, and due to the conflicting times and inconvenience for attendees to travel back and forth, the County Party Organization Rectification Committee decided to change the venue to Beiqiao and jointly hold the ceremony with the county government. A letter has been sent to the county government and a notice has been issued to various agencies.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Narcotics Association Begins Investigating Drug Situation in the 19th Year</h3>
<p>The China National Anti-Narcotics Association, regarding the achievements of the entire year in tobacco prohibition and the situations in various regions obtained from the previous investigation of the 18th year, has already begun editing the fourth volume of the "China Tobacco Disaster Yearbook," which will be published soon. This is for the reference of those concerned with the tobacco prohibition problem and the disasters caused by tobacco in China. The association plans to continue investigating the drug situations in various regions for the 19th year of the Republic. Recently, the investigation department of the association has formulated various investigation forms, and as soon as they are approved by the Standing Committee, the investigation will begin. It is heard that in addition to courts, county governments, post offices, railway bureaus, customs, etc., this year's investigation will expand its scope and extend to other aspects to obtain a true picture of the drug situation in various regions. The association plans to ask the provincial affairs offices in various regions to assist in the investigation, and at the same time, it will also ask public organizations and individuals enthusiastic about anti-narcotics in various regions to share the task.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Public Bus Patronizes Cake Shops and Iron Shops</h3>
<p>▲ Similar to public buses in the foreign concessions</p>
<p>▲ Cake stall ovens and iron shop apprentices suffer</p>
<p>Last Saturday and Sunday, a public bus of Route 9 of the Public Concession crashed into the reception room at No. 602, the corner of Avenue Foch and Avenue du Roi Albert, which was a topic of conversation for a while. Unexpectedly, three days later, a similar incident occurred in Zhabei. However, the places patronized by the bus were not reception rooms but cake stalls and iron shops. It can be said that there are coincidences in car accidents. This incident occurred at around 3 p.m. yesterday. A Huashang public bus, Route 3, No. 4011, traveling in Zhabei, was driving west along No. 1466, Qujiang Road, when, for some unknown reason, the machinery suddenly became uncontrollable. The front of the bus swerved to the left, causing it to knock over the oven of the cake stall set up by Zhang Xingbang at No. 1466. The pillars in front of the door were also shaken and broken. However, the engine failed to brake, and it continued to move forward, causing the Xiao Shuntai iron shop at No. 1468 to also suffer. Wang Xuerong, an apprentice standing at the door doing work, was run over by the wheel and fell to the ground in pain. Passengers in the bus were shocked by the sight and got out of the bus one after another. The front of the bus was also damaged due to excessive shock, and the machinery broke down, making it impossible to drive any further. Police officers from the Zhongxing Road police station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau immediately went to investigate everything after hearing the news. Wang Xuerong, the iron shop apprentice who was run over, was sent to the hospital for treatment by the shop owner, but his injuries were severe and he was in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Youth Disgusted with the World Attempts Suicide in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>▲ Recently wrote a municipal book</p>
<p>▲ Doesn't know if the bookstore will accept it</p>
<p>▲ Future is bleak, hence the suicide attempt</p>
<p>At 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, a young man hired a No. 609 sampan at the Yangjingbang wharf, claiming to cross over to the British warship anchored in the center of the Huangpu River. The boatman asked for four dimes as a round-trip fare, and the young man paid the full amount. Unexpectedly, after leaving the shore for five or six zhang, he suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was rescued on the spot by the boatman and sent to the water police station. After questioning, he stated that his name was Shen Daoyuan, 22 years old, from Wuxi, and that his home was at No. 34, Yingya Pavilion, in the city of his hometown. His father's name was Jinhua, and he ran a Demaosen silk and cloth shop outside the North Gate of his hometown. There was one elder brother and one younger brother in the family. The elder brother worked in the shop, and the younger brother was still studying. He himself had studied at a certain university in Wusong but had not yet graduated. He dropped out of school due to some reasons, stayed at home, and felt extremely bored. In his spare time, he did some writing and submitted it to various magazines or newspapers for publication. He recently wrote a municipal book, about a hundred pages long. This morning (i.e., the morning before yesterday), he took five yuan from home as travel expenses, carried the book, and bid farewell to his mother to come to Shanghai by car, intending to submit it to a bookstore for publication. He spent one and a half yuan on the car fare. After arriving in Shanghai, he stayed in a three-yuan room at the Shenzhou Hotel on the Fourth Avenue, with only half a yuan left for spending. In the afternoon, he took the book to a certain bookstore on the Fourth Avenue to discuss the matter. After the bookstore took the book, they said that they would reply within three days whether or not to accept it. When he left the bookstore, he suddenly felt dizzy and thought that he had no permanent job at present and that the future was difficult to predict. It would be better to leave this evil world as soon as possible, so he jumped into the river to seek death. According to his statement, the head of the police ordered him to stay in the police station for the night. Yesterday morning, he ordered Detective Huang Songsheng to send him to the Wuxi Fellow-Villagers Association to find a way to send him back to his hometown.</p>

<p>▲ Accused of harboring criminals</p>
<p>Zeng Xianzhi, a former employee of the Chuanhan Railway Bureau, was recently accused by Feng Lizhou, who hired a lawyer at the Special District Local Court, of criminal concealment of criminals.

However, Zeng resisted the summons and failed to appear, so the warrant was changed to an arrest warrant, which was ordered to be apprehended but not obtained. A few days ago, Feng learned that Zeng was hosting a banquet at the Xinghualou Restaurant on Fuzhou Road, so he notified the Huizha Police Station to cooperate in the execution of the arrest warrant by Chinese policeman No. 1689, who secretly went to Xinghualou on the evening of the 8th and arrested Zeng in Room 44.

<h3>Shunheng Foreign Company Loses Two Ships in Accidents</h3>
<p>▲ Huge losses</p>
<p>▲ Talico Ship Blown Up and Sunk</p>
<p>A month ago, the Shunheng Foreign Company had a cargo ship named S.S. Trecolor, which set off from Hamburg, Germany, directly to Shanghai. The ship was fully loaded with dangerous explosives. It was loaded to Shanghai for unloading. When the ship arrived outside the port of Colombo in Ceylon, the white medicine loaded in the middle compartment suddenly exploded due to the heat, the middle compartment was breached, and the ship sank into the sea. Many crew members and sailors were injured in the explosion. Unexpectedly, on the third day after sinking into the sea, the gunpowder and bullets in the front and rear compartments exploded a second time on the seabed, causing the ship to be completely destroyed. The ammunition and weapons that were intended to be salvaged were completely lost. The value of the goods reached ten million yuan, and the loss of the ship was also over one million. The matter has been notified to the main recipient of the goods purchased by our country who handled the goods.</p>
<p>▲ Roseville Ship Runs Aground</p>
<p>The Roseville of the Shunheng Foreign Company was carrying a large batch of American timber and salted fish from the Pacific Ocean to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, 70% of the Shanghai cargo was unloaded, and the remaining 30% was transferred to Xiamen and Hong Kong for unloading. The ship left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the morning of the 7th. When it reached the sea off Fuzhou, about 60 nautical miles from the island of Dnabu (transliteration) in Hong Kong, it suddenly encountered a thick fog. The navigation route was obscured by the fog. The captain, Johnson, mistakenly steered the ship onto a reef outside the island. The bottom of the ship ran into the reef and was immediately breached. Seawater then entered. The captain, fearing that the ship would sink immediately, steered the ship onto the reef so that it could be grounded and not sink. He urgently sent a radio message to Shanghai for help. After receiving the news, the Shanghai Bureau transferred the message to the Hong Kong line because Hong Kong was closer, and asked them to send a tugboat to rescue the ship as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲ All Crew Members Rescued</p>
<p>Yesterday, the line continued to receive a telegram from the ship stating that the ship had gradually sunk into the sea, and the seawater had reached the deck. The cargo in the compartments had been submerged in the water. The barge sent by the port had not been able to unload the cargo. The crew members and sailors, a total of 37 people, were fortunate to be in the daytime when the accident occurred. They each took lifeboats and scrambled to escape to the sea. Fortunately, there was a lighthouse nearby, and the crew members had gathered to the mountain on the lighthouse to wait for the rescue ship. All of them survived and none were killed. Yesterday, the captain, Johnson, also left the ship. Everyone barely escaped. After the Hong Kong barge arrived, it took the captain and crew members on the mountain back to Hong Kong. The ship was too badly damaged to be towed and rescued. Yesterday, an employee of the line told a reporter that the situation of this ship was equal to Xinchang, and it would probably sink completely into the sea after some time. The ship's carrying capacity was 8,000 tons, and the public and private losses, including cargo and crew luggage, were at least one million yuan. Both ships were insured, and Shunheng had no losses.</p>
<h3>Special Maritime News</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Ship Encounters Danger</p>
<p>The Honghai Maru, a cargo ship of the Japanese Osaka Marine Fire Insurance Company, has a carrying capacity of 1,300 tons. This time, it set off from Tianjin to Shanghai and could arrive in four days as usual. However, after crossing the river, the ship encountered strong winds and fog at sea, making navigation difficult. It was unprecedented. It was in a dangerous situation several times in the frightening wind and waves. Fortunately, the captain and crew members worked hard to support it and were able to avoid sinking. Yesterday, the ship arrived in Shanghai, and the captain and crew members were grateful for their survival. The captain went to the Japanese consulate to report the situation of the disaster and planned to unload the coal and inspect the bottom of the ship for damage.</p>
<p>▲ More News About Xinchang</p>

Regarding the loss of crew members' luggage, the bureau will issue subsidies according to the example of the Xinjin disaster. As for salvaging the ship, it will be decided after the divers who were sent to inspect the seabed at the place of the accident return to Shanghai to report. The ship's machinery is excellent and it has been decided to dismantle it and transport it to Shanghai. If it is impossible to salvage it, the method of dismantling it by sections will be carried out.</p>

<h3>Candidates for Shanghai Municipal Council Foreign Board Express Political Views</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin News reports that Okamoto of Japan and Peier and Xiebade of England, three candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Council board, have expressed their opinions. Okamoto does not support the Shanghai Municipal Council's acquisition of the Dagua Hotel property or the sale of the existing council site because it is located in a remote western area with high land prices, and there is no need to relocate the Shanghai Municipal Council site. Regarding the lack of open space in the western district, he believes that other districts in the concession are more densely populated and therefore have a greater need for open spaces. As for the issue of roads extending beyond the boundaries, he believes that the assistance of the consular corps is necessary to achieve a solution. He strongly advocates for transparency in municipal affairs and proposes that the Shanghai Municipal Council should establish a public information department, similar to those in major Western cities. He believes that the current practice of only reporting major events to the public is outdated. Peier will delay expressing his opinion on the Dagua Hotel issue but strongly opposes the sale of the existing Shanghai Municipal Council site. He also advocates for the urgent addition of open spaces in the northern and eastern districts and strongly supports transparency in municipal affairs, agreeing with the establishment of a public information department. Xiebade has not expressed any opinion on the issues of acquiring the Dagua Hotel and selling the Shanghai Municipal Council site. Regarding transparency in municipal affairs, he believes that the current practices have no shortcomings and does not support the establishment of a public information department. He has accepted the proposal to add open spaces in the northern and eastern districts in principle but believes that the only thing lacking is funding. Regarding the issue of building roads beyond the boundaries, he believes that the Chinese authorities should allow the situation to remain as it is before a practical solution is agreed upon.</p>

The association will respond to the Ningyan Physicians’ Association with this information. (4) Committee member Wang Qizhang submitted an opinion on the Western medicine physician examination regulations announced by the Examination Yuan, requesting discussion by various medical associations.

<h3>Appeal for Disaster Relief in Shan County, Shaanxi</h3>
<p>▲Red Cross Receives Telegram from Shan County Party Consolidation Committee</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from the Party Consolidation Committee of Shan County, Henan Province, stating: "Our Henan Province is afflicted by natural and man-made disasters that come together, with no escape from bandits, locusts, droughts, and wars. Shanling County is the most severely affected. Since the great bandit Lao Yangren broke the city in the eleventh year, killing, burning, looting, and committing all kinds of atrocities, continuous warfare has followed, with no peaceful years. The people are exhausted and their suffering is indescribable. Last year, the rebel Feng Mutiny, occupying western Henan with hundreds of thousands of troops, relied entirely on our small and weak populace for support, supply, conscription, borrowing money, requisitioning grain, demolishing houses, and seizing livestock. Such acts of plunder by the troops were commonplace. The people endured a year of deep suffering. Our Shan County is on the verge of collapse. Heaven does not pity us and has added to our calamities with famine. Summer crops and autumn harvests have failed for consecutive years. The wealthy have no means to make a living, and the poor are wandering the roads. Now, in the cold winter, the post-disaster victims, how can they endure it? We hereby telegraphically appeal to all sectors for the people and hope that benevolent people will show compassion and generously donate grain and funds. Then, the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in Shan County will be eternally grateful. The urgency of the telegram cannot express the eager anticipation.</p>
<h3>Three Lost Children Awaiting Collection</h3>

When questioned by the director of the sub-bureau, the girl stated that her name was Wang Maomao, three years old, from Haimen. Her father has returned to his hometown, and her mother is in Shanghai. She came out of her house today and lost her way home after playing in the street, so she was crying. She is being kept at the sub-bureau awaiting collection by her family.</p>
<p>▲Boy with No Name: Zhou Yintang, a guard policeman from the 1st post of the same sub-bureau, found a boy around 4 or 5 years old wandering on Xiaoputuo Bridge Street at around 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. He was wearing a blue floral cloth jacket and pants, black socks, and blue cloth shoes, and had a flat-top haircut. He appeared to be lost and was immediately brought back to the sub-bureau. When questioned by the director of the sub-bureau, the boy refused to speak, so his family's name and address could not be determined. He is being kept at the sub-bureau awaiting collection.</p>
<p>▲Boy Qian Ayu: The Municipal Public Security Bureau reported yesterday that the 3rd sub-bureau of the 5th District had sent a lost boy named Qian Ayu. According to his statement, he is nine years old, from Shanghai, and cannot remember his home address. He has parents; his father's name is Qian Yinchang. This time, he went to visit relatives with his mother and got separated and lost on the way home.

<h3>Zongbiao Painting Society Correspondence Course Enrollment</h3>

<h3>Dafeng Daily to Be Published Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Dafeng Daily, a tri-daily newspaper organized by Xu Muyun and Xiao Ting, two brothers in the Shanghai literary and art circles, is scheduled to be published today. The writers, such as She Yu, Guo Yi, Ban Kuang, Huo Gong, Zi Bao, and Shao Qing, are all well-known figures. The illustrations by Ding Muqin and Wu Tianweng are particularly profound and incisive. The first issue contains two photographs taken during the transfer of Sun Yat-sen's remains to the Western Hills, featuring important figures from all sides. The content is extremely valuable. The issue coincides with the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death and is very timely. The second issue contains a portrait of Wu Mingyi, the fiancé of Zhang Biyue, the protagonist in the shooting of Huang Changxing. Zhang divorced Wu because of Huang's dissuasion and later learned that she had been deceived by Huang. Therefore, she shot Huang in anger. This matter caused a national sensation. The Shangyue Society even adapted it into a new play. Wu's demeanor must be something that the general public is eager to see. Zhang Biyue previously committed suicide at Datong University. Wu has written a long article for the newspaper, which will be revealed in the second issue. It is thought that the general reader will want to read it first.</p>
<h3>Gentai Heye Flour Sells Well</h3>
<p>The Gentai Heye Flour Factory, solely funded by the Shanghai magnate Cheng Linsheng, has a long history. Its Heye flour is rich in nutrients, exquisitely delicious, made of pure ingredients, and beneficial to health.

Those who previously used imported products are now using domestic Heye flour across the board. Mr. Li Quanshen, the manager of the factory, is even more hardworking and serves as the technician, striving for delicious taste and white color for the products. Due to the strong sales, the factory is working day and night to step up production.</p>
<h3>Lihua Company Did Not Establish a Savings Department</h3>
<p>The Lihua Company received an official letter from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday stating that the company also operates a savings department. The Lihua Company stated that it has been in business for six years, and the working capital used in previous years relied solely on the turnover of shares. It never engaged in savings activities. In the autumn of the 19th year, due to seeing shareholders and employees frequently adding small amounts of money, savings were attached to the coupon sales office. As of now, the total amount is less than 10,000 yuan, all added by shareholders and employees, which is absolutely not in the nature of savings. For the sake of prudence, the company has never advertised in newspapers or distributed printed materials to solicit savings. Moreover, since the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to ban companies from also operating savings, the company was concerned that the savings would also be in conflict, so it had already stopped accepting deposits and was successively notifying shareholders and employees to withdraw their savings to avoid misunderstandings. The company plans to submit a document to the Social Affairs Bureau in the near future to report the above situation.</p>
