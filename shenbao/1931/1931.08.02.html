<h3>職業敎育</h3>
<p>職業敎育含義有二。一爲廣義的。一爲狹義的。即如中華職業敎育社所揭示之目的。曰爲個人謀生之準備。曰爲個人服務社會之準備。曰爲國家及世界增進生産力之準備。後者爲廣義。而前二者則爲狹義。</p>
<p>敎育之目的。不僅在於解决個人問題。局部問題。而重在於解决整個問題。職業敎育之目的。亦正同此。今日呈現於吾人眼前之根本問題至多。如人口。政治。經濟等。互相綜錯。使社會時不能趨於常軌。而職業問題常不能得到合理之地位。廣義之職業敎育。即運用敎育之偉力。敎育全社會解决此綜錯矛盾之諸問題。安定其秩序發抒其機能。使社會向新的建設的道路上發展使人民之學習技能與就業都能有可以估定之鵠的。使能得到合理之解决。無業者皆能有業。進而使社會之産力增高。此則廣義之職業敎育也。</p>
<p>狹義之職業敎育。則於（一）敎育人民必有職業并使其覺悟職業之尊貴。與無職業之可。恥（二）敎育人民　然於職業爲個人與社會在能力與需要上相互交易之意義。社會有建造房屋之需要。個人有建造房屋之能力。個人有衣食之需要。社會有供給衣食之能力。而後建築之事業。乃有成立之可能。人民明乎此義。乃能視社會進展之前途。與時代進化之潮流。擇定新興之職業。（三）敎育人民自知自擇。使其於就學之前。可以學當其才。就業之後。可以用當其學。人能盡才。人各得所。（四）敎育人民腦與手同時並用。以求知識與	經騐。能融匯貫通。互爲助力。如學生之偏用腦者。勉之以用手農工之偏用手者。勉之以用腦。庶全國人民能知而又能行。（五）敎育人民於就業之後。應如何忠實服務。如何對其職業發生興趣。使能樂其所業。而增加工作上之效能。（六）敎育人民應用新的科學方法。以改進舊的職業。如我國舊有之七十二行。如加以科學上之改進固皆爲生活之工具。同時并敎育工商店舖以新的科學管理方法。革除舊有陋規與陋習。以上六者。皆狹義之職業敎育也。</p>
<p>廣義狹義。雖含義稍異。而兩者實共有相互不可分離之關聨。蓋解决個人問題。即可推以解决社會問題。解决社會問題。亦即所以解决個人問題。言其終點。則都爲民生問題之獲得合理的解决。</p>
<p>今日職業敎育之爲改進社會。改善人民生計之一大動力。殆無疑義。而其爲挽救。我國家之貧乏之一種積極有效方法。應亦爲吾人所共認。職業敎育社諸君積十四年之艱苦努力。得有今日初步之成效。廻湖以往。預揣方來。記者謹祝其更以加倍之努力。獲得更大的成功之　實。該會會塲中有聨云。「孔子不是說過己欲立而立人。己欲達而達人。可謂仁者之方也矣。我們本這樣想。使無業者有業。使有業者樂業。還有什麽問題呢。」斯言誠的。夫果能由一國以至世界。人皆有業。人皆樂業。即人皆有生。生皆有樂。宇宙間尙復有何爭端。有何問題。政此不難。要在吾人今後之加緊努力耳。</p>

<h3>韓民移殖東北之研究</h3>
<p>（十續）彬·</p>
<p>（六）我國今後應取之對策</p>
<p>關於日本移殖韓僑之陰謀。及韓民移殖對我國計民生之迫害。前數節旣已詳言。於此。吾人當可瞭然於日本帝國主義者謀我之周密。手段之險惡。及韓僑問題之嚴重。我國處此情勢之下。究應採取何種對策。以去除此心腹之隠患。實爲國人當前亟應討論之重大問題。著者參酌時論。并就鄙見所及。略陳數點如左。</p>
<p>（一）交涉澈退駐屯東北之日本軍警　日本駐在我東北之軍隊。以其嚴守秘密。拒絶調查。故無從探悉其詳確數目。但就其所謂「關東軍司令部」「駐剳師團」「獨立守備隊」「旅順要塞司令部」「關東憲兵隊」等名義統轄下之軍隊而估計。爲數即已不少。益以韓民所到之地。日本即籍口設</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>置警察。實行變查增兵。合總計算。其數目字當更足驚人。而且日軍駐紮之處。都有砲臺遠望臺飛行塲及無線有線電等設置。武備之雄厚。實令我人不寒而慄。我國境内。乃容他人之鐵騎。長期屯駐。其爲可危。正不僅他人酣睡於我臥榻之側而已。即舍其爲害遠者大者不言而其妨害我國權。及歷次槍殺我國民。皆已爲獨立國家所無可忍受。此次萬寳山案件發生日軍警藉口保護韓僑。長駐當地。實行保護韓民挖河築壩。并開放排槍。掃射我農民。以武力實施其拓殖政策。更昭然若揭。故爲鞏固我國防計。爲維護我國權計。爲保障我國民之生計與生命計。我政府極應向日本嚴重交涉。限期撤退駐在我東北各地之軍警。庶不良韓人失其庇翼。而免除今後無穹之糾紛。</p>
<p>（二）取締韓民入境清理在境韓僑國籍僑居我東北之韓民。有入日本籍者。有入我國籍者。有無國籍者。亦有跨中日兩國籍者。混居雜處。管理至感困難。而日人乃更藉此混亂。上下其手。施其奸計。故目前取締韓僑入境。及清理在境韓民國籍。實爲要圖。今年全國内政會議。對此曾有决議。爲（一）凡居住中國地方。繼續已滿十年以上之韓民。確係品行端正。且有相當職業者。應勸令其依照中國國籍法。聲請歸化務使其服從中國法律。以便管理。（二）爲妨止韓民增加起見。各省市政府。對入境韓民。須嚴加取締。除以日本國籍而來者。應依中日通商條約辦理外。絶對不容此項具有危險性份子羼入非通商口岸。或騙取我國公私權。（三）凡住有韓民地方。市縣政府須於最近時期内。舉辦已未歸化韓民之登記。如不登記者。以日人論。照中日條約辦理。（四）詳細規定歸化韓民部分公權及私權。法至完善。但决議旣久。迄未執行。殊爲可惜耳。</p>
<p>（三）嚴禁國人私售田地日人在我東北。本無購買土地權。民四雖曾於絶無理由之二十一條中提出土地商租權一條。但此亡國之條約。我國絶未承認。惟韓民因善治水田。故在東北各地租地種稻。彼旣獲厚利。我國農民亦可得到較旱地更高之租價。又以彼亡國孑遺。就食無所。故特允租種。惠彼流離。對於租田辦法。則嚴格規定。如韓人租借水田。及其他土地。照章須經當地所屬縣政府批准。佃耕契約之期限。由五年改爲三年。後又縮爲一年。但日人對此規定。極力破壞。且肆其手段。籠絡我國農民私將田地押於韓人。更由韓人轉讓日人。一落日人之手。日人即曲辭狡賴。認爲賣給。不許我國農民贖回。因此種轉讓。遂使日人在我東北握有多量之土地。而使我國農民蒙受莫大之損失。我國權蒙受莫大之迫害。而且糾紛百出。懸案纍纍。故今後我東北當局。亟應嚴格禁止國人私將田地租讓外人。并根抿内政會議决議中。「爲妨止本國人民擅自租賣土地與韓人起見。應嚴定盜賣或擅租國土懲處條例。以資儆戒」之原則。擬定各種條例。嚴格執行。</p>
<p>（四）積極奬勵内地移民東北三省人口。據東北地方政府調查。遼寗省土地面積爲一·一五四·○七三華方里。人口爲一六·三六六·一七五。吉林省土地面積爲一·三一八·六五○。人口爲七三三九·九四四。黑龍江土地最大。面積爲二·二九二·一三五。而人口最少。僅有三·六五五·五九○。依此以計算人口密度。則遼寗省每華方里平均人數爲一四·一人。吉林省爲五·六。而黑龍江爲一·七。與内地十八省人口密度平均每方華里二十五人。相去至爲懸殊。而且東北未開墾之土地。尤爲廣闊。在遼省。昔日洮昌道屬之哲里木盟全部。有十之六七土地地尙未開墾。在吉林。除長春吉林農安德惠雙城濱江阿城等縣外。餘多未墾。在黑省。除呼海沿線及安達附近各縣已有十之四五士地開墾外。其他各處均尙有十之七八未墾。如此廣闊之土地逼邇强鄰。如不積極移民墾殖。則我之空虚。正人之所喜。强鄰覬覦。詎豈能免。故積極奬勵内地移民充實邊疆。一以開發我富源。一以杜絶窺伺。更以紓我内省人口之擁擠。實至爲得策。</p>
<p>我内地人民之移殖東北。就歷史上觀之。實未能取得若何之效果。查民國十三年至十六年四年間。我内省移殖東北之人數。有如左表。</p>

<p>由上表觀之。内地人民之向東北移殖數目。似年有增加。但據滿鐵調查。自一九二三年至一九二九年之内地移民入境者。爲四百八十萬餘人。出境者二百十二萬餘人。去留比例。爲百分之四十四。此則吾人所應深予注意者。韓人能安居我土而國人則反。之此無他。韓人常有日本完善之殖民政策爲之援助。而我内省移民。我政府尙多未能有精密與完善之計劃。故内省移民抵東北後。多有無法生存者。不得不再離開東北而流亡於四方。故今後我國當局應極力注意於移民政策之改善。一方面積極奬勵移殖。一方面强制移殖難民。并於其生活生計上謀妥善之計劃。使得以安居樂業不至去而復返。</p>
<p>（五）延邊四縣改設特别區域　日人在吉林延琿和汪四縣。已漸寳施其侵併之計劃。在此四縣設領事七人。警察署七處。陸軍憲兵守備各隊約十一萬餘人。警察二千名以。上私移圖們江中韓界碑。并命名延吉爲間島。汪清爲北間島。琿春爲東間島。和龍爲南間島。我延邊四縣彼統以間島名之。其吞併之野心。至爲露骨。據本年三月統計。此四縣鮮民已達五十餘萬之多。佔居民十之七八。人數旣衆。良莠不齊。故糾紛特多。該地行政監督權力較小。當此邊疆之重任。似難應付裕如。故今日爲保我國土衛我國民計。對於延邊四縣。可改爲特别區域。簡派大員率領重兵坐鎭。庶免强鄰窺伺。國土喪失於無形。</p>
<p>（六）設立韓民管理局去年内政會議决議案中。有於延邊適堂點。設韓人管理局。對入籍韓民厲行同化政策。積極普及國語國文敎育。并授以歷史知識。以提倡其民族思想之决議。此種主張。亦爲有效之對策。亟宜實行。</p>
<p>著者所見。差盡於此。要之東北之韓僑問題。不始於今日。養癰積疾。寖成心腹大患。時至今日。禍象顯著。再不亟謀補救。則以日人之急進。韓人之亡命。其爲禍患。當更不知伊於胡底。田中義一之陰謀。茲已一一見諸事實。顧念前途。令人寒心。我政府於此。亟應以斷然手段。施行緊急之對策。庶拔去禍根。尙未爲晚。假如再因循坐視。則根牢蒂固。此問題將永無可解决。尤有進者。韓自亡國。民皆流離。除一部分有志之士。正急謀復國者外。大多數韓民之出路。非依附我國。即依日或依俄。依日依俄。供其驅使。以寇我邊。都於我不利。若能善爲處置。嚴爲管理。則此流離之孑遺。皆開發我東北富源之健兒。抑且深符於我國家扶植弱小民族之本意。凡此皆我政府我民族我國人於今日談解决韓僑問題時。所應予以加意思慮者也。（完）</p>

<h3>京城鎭南浦新義州華僑現况</h3>
<p>仁川通信、愚於二十四日早赴鎭南浦、二十五日赴京城、二十六日抵仁川調查僑胞情形、分述如次、</p>
<p>京城華僑現狀　京城原有華僑七千餘、其中業商者約近二千、業種菜者三千餘爲勞工、事發後、收容於、總領事館者四千餘其餘則由仁川方面乘輪回國事平之後、種茶者以所藝園圃悉爲鮮人毁搗、無維持生計之策遂有五分之四歸國、業勞工者、亦無事可作、經總商會勸回本國、商店除較大者外、資本無多、經過此番損害、無力恢復、亦因以回國、故京城現在所居華僑在市街内者、不及一千、在鄉村間者、約有八百、較諸慘案以前減少五分之三、商店雖照常開門復市、但殊少主顧、日鮮人除團結抵制華商、不購華商所售貨物外、即夙所喜食之中國料理、亦散布謠言、謂華人置毒於内、以圖報復、故中國料理店一百十家、開業者僅三十餘處、但生意清淡、門可羅雀華僑業苦工及種菜者、因無川資回國、每日到商會請求救濟者、日凡數起、均由總商會設法送往仁川、再由仁川商會向船隻交涉、半價運返烟臺、大阪總商會、匯到京城救濟費日金二千元、大阪北幫公所匯到四千七百七十元二角、其他如京城日鮮民衆團體表示同情、捐送欵物者、約近二千、均由京城總商會分發於仁川平壤元山等處分用、京畿道於出事後、曾派人送致千元救卹金、爲總商會拒絶、此外各日本官廳所贈送者、皆由商會婉辭、京城以朝鮮</p>
<h3>平壤日警帮同鮮人撕毁貨物</h3>
<p>總督所在地、鮮人對於未出境華僑、雖仍仇視、第格於日當局面子、尙無分外行動、在四鄉之華僑、或不免仍有被毆擊情事、種菜者多晝間在鄉工作、晚則歸宿城内、以求安全、七月二十六日、有元山華僑五百、因當地不能生活、搭車歸國、啟行之前、由元山領館商會、電知京城總領館及商會、請求資送回國、總商會主席宫鶴汀、往見朝鮮總督府外事課長、請予免費乘車、准五百人、自京城轉車去安東、日方不允、交涉多時始允減半收票價、如欲全免、可收京畿道一千元慰問金、即用以交付半價車費、、鐵路當局不受損失華方可一錢不費、宫以我政府明令不收日官府任何欵項、故拒絶、之最後仍由會中　欵購半價票、計費去二千○三十八元二角五分、内中一百三十六名、則由京城轉仁川、即搭二十八號共同丸、於七月二十七日回國、船票則由仁川商會負担、</p>
<p>仁川華僑現狀仁川華僑屬於流動性質、因其地距我烟臺威海甚近、僑民來去自由、故迄無統計、在事發前、約計六千餘人、勞工在三千以上、種菜者千餘人、餘爲商人、在朝鮮街商店均被搗毁、現在五分之二勉强復業、生意之清淡、同於京城、在支那町（即中國街）之商店、於七月十一日復業、朝鮮人相約不到中國街中國商店購物、復業等於未復、故自七月五日以還、各商營業之間接損失、已不勝計數、因營業絶望、及慮前途危險而回國者居多半數、目下商人約餘九百人、工人則不過六百餘人、種菜者約五百人、</p>

<p>留鮮華僑</p>
<h3>决心全體回國</h3>
<p>鮮人排華之原因　此次朝鮮排華原因複雜茲據駐鮮領館方面消息暴動原因尙有下述兩項（一）受不景氣影響日鮮人賦閒甚多見我農工事業發達屢思驅逐而無所藉口總督府擬以不發勞働許可證爲抵制然尙以爲不澈底故借萬寳山案暗令報紙誇大其辭藉以激怒鮮　人惹起風潮以便達其驅逐華人之目的（二）鮮人鑒於民十六之排華暴動我國交涉毫無結果故毆殺華人視爲無足畏懼之事又因有人暗中爲之主持乃益恣行無忌隨地槍殺</p>
<p>日人確有主使嫌疑　至此次暴動日人在後主使事屬顯然茲再舉事實以證之（一）鮮人襲擊時我僑作正當防衛曾毆傷鮮人一名警署即强索兇手要求醫藥生活等費至毆死我僑之兇手則警署明捉暗放且各團體印就勸告鮮民傳單警署禁止分發（二）華僑因鮮人兇行投警署懇暫收留以避其鋒時每遭拒絶任憑鮮人虐殺因之有避難山上饑餓而死者或被逼投水而死者慘不忍聞</p>
<p>僑胞擬全體歸國　旅鮮華僑經此慘劇商業基礎業已破壞無餘陸續歸國者不可計數其有勉强支持者亦因環境險惡生意蕭條人心惶惶不可終日華工又無形被逐凈盡已失從前地位如政府交涉無效决計全體歸國現已分頭接洽正在積極預備查旅鮮僑胞不過十萬日韓人僑居我東三省者在百萬　上財産數十倍於我僑我僑如果歸國日方必有所顧慮故此次交涉深望政府</p>

<p>胡樸安致詞略謂、最近敎育上最困難之問題、無過於學生出路問題、小學生畢業以後未必盡能升學中學生畢業以後未必盡、入大學、於是此種不升學、之學生勢必欲求職業、可是平日未受職業訓練、一無專長、試問以何技能從事職業、旣使勉强得業、試問如何可以適合社會之應用、加以社會引誘、虚榮心之縈惑、人人尤以服務政界爲目的、於是所受敎育、更不以眞才實學爲重、因此專才愈少、普通人才太多、甚至學了專長的各敎師、不樂爲敎師工程師不願爲工程師、而敎育工程二界之人才愈少、故今後之敎育、非從專業訓練切實培養事業界有用之人才不可、此職業敎育實爲今日最需要之敎育、非合全國之力量從事進行、不易成功、尤其是一國基本之農業應用敎育方法、促其進步、喚起全國靑年之注意、一致求眞才實學、爲救國之工作、俾學生之知識技能都見攔熟、不但在書本上求學問、更須在實地工作上求經騐、打破升官發財之觀念、而以學術工業農業、致用於社會、此爲職業敎育最大之任務、以諸君平日努力於職業敎育之熱心、必能於中國民生問題、放一異彩云、次葉主席代表省府秘書長、</p>
<p>金體乾致詞　略謂、職業敎育爲救國之最良敎育、吾蘇敎育向不後人、惟於職業敎育、尙待努力、以求救濟衰弱之民生、發展地方富源云云、</p>

<p>連鎖的圖書館</p>
<p>英國著名圖書館之一希爾福敎堂Hereford　Cathedral的連鎖圖書館Chained　Library。最近經過了一度徹底的修整。已重行開幕了。怎魔呌做連鎖圖書館呢。因爲當初書價極貴。而對於讀者的私德上不無懐疑。深恐他們讀罷之後。帶著書本同去。因此將館中所陳列的一千五百本書籍。一一連銷在書架上。不能帶走。像這樣的連鎖圖書館。在英國還有幾所。不過規模都不及希爾福的來得大。在孟吉斯德Manchester境内。計有三所。内中兩所是屬於敎堂而一所是屬於學校的。年代都極古。創辦於十七世紀此。外華昔司德Worcester的敎堂。也有一個圖書館。創辦於一千四百六十四年。館中所有的書。並不用鎖鏈鎖住但是都黏住在書架上。不能移動的。</p>
<h3>公師長脫險追記</h3>
<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>聞前敵歸來者云。國軍勦赤。凡獲俘虜。弗問官佐士卒。悉予優遇。共黨則否。我將校之爲執者。罔不處以極刑。而數月前公秉藩師長在贛努力勦赤。身陷匪窟。而卒獲安然歸來者。乃其智之過人也公身臨前敵。敗。不獲潰圍。以徒死無益於黨國。急易士卒服雜亂軍中。共爲所擄。旣至匪窟。匪固知此數十敗軍中有公在。第不識其人。乃遍告衆虜曰。誰能指告公師長者。當受上賞。公素視下善。與同甘苦。故無言之。者公雖易服。而眉宇間有英氣。究有異於庶卒。一匪趨前執之曰。若非公秉藩乎。何混入魚目爲。公泰然曰。否。我固小卒某某也。部下亦同聲曰。彼誠同伴某某也。匪又不能决。而終不能無疑。翌日。匪出揚言於公等曰。汝曹投假革命旗幟下。受人之惑。實爲可憐。誰無父母。誰無妻子。汝曹家人。望眼欲穿矣。今各予兩金。持速歸去。躬耕可食也。言畢。一匪携銀出。人各兩。金至公。獨减其半。公思人兩金。我獲一。其意何居。旣見衆匪目灼灼視彼。益知必以此試其眞假公某矣。乃挺身而言曰。鄉關迢迢。旅途食宿。兩金猶不足。而又人厚我薄。何也匪聞之。果决彼非公某。乃補以一金。公於是偕部下去。越山渡澗。跋涉歸來。重振師旅。獻身黨國矣。匪之予公一金也。視其果爲公者。必不計多寡以速去是求。去則執之。公逆知匪意。而玩之於掌上。故其脫險。乃恃智之過人也。</p>
<h3>記本山茶</h3>
<p>— 蔣祖堯</p>
<p>虞山不以茶名。顧産茶特佳。而人無知者。往余嘗遊興福維序諸寺。寺僧供客。輒以茶至。余飲之而甘。叩其名。則曰。此本山茶也。煑以聨珠洞泉當尤勝。余心誌之未嘗忘。他日。過聨珠洞。天雨。憩大土庵。庵久荒廢。室隅置一　。一鉢。一僧踞而吹火。聲颼　然。與風雨相和。少間。茶熟。捧以進。試之。良信。問何以與他寺異。曰。焙異。泉異。火候異。色香味。遂無不異也。余笑而頷之。盡數盞而去。兩腋欲舉矣。自是酷愛之若命。昔吳次尾嗜茶。日用炭六斤。水二十二升。茶至二兩。而獨喜蓄里之田中茶。余之所好。母乃類是。然竊有感焉。自交通利便。客之游於我虞者。踵相接。於是春之菌。秋之栗。無不載譽而去。名塞天下。而本山茶獨鮮人問及。是果茶之幸耶。抑茶之不幸耶。揭而出之。將以貽同好云。</p>
<h3>貓生兩翼之奇聞</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>貓爲捕鼠動物緣牆爬壁。技固甚奇。從未聞貓能生翼。貓而能生翼。撲撲高飛。鼠子雖狡。將無噍類。吾邑有何家　者。位於邑之東鄙。　有李姓。家畜一貓。毛作深黑色。色潔而光潤。與常貓無異。唯心性却較伶俐。主人甚愛之。貓之在家也。朝出暮歸。主人以其效齊人乞食。故亦不稍查詢。詎兩月以來。貓自某晨出外。忽告失踪。雖四處尋覓。杳無踪影。主人疑其暴斃於野。或爲他獸所食。惟惋惜之而已。不謂近數日來。忽有人發現該貓出没於河水之間。貓之肘下。并添生肉翅兩片。撲撲水面。捕捉魚蝦果腹。爲狀甚樂。主人聞其言。曾設法捕起。不旋踵間。又告失踪。蓋該貓恃水爲家。已不慣陸上生活。說者謂該貓平時旣朝出暮歸。捕捉魚蝦爲食。顯係非一日之事。水棲日久。肉食過多。致生此兩片肉翼。事之奇特。殊令人費解。近聞其主人。又從事第二次捕捉。若捕到。擬送至某處陳列。以便供一般生物學家之研究。但該貓賦性殊狡黠。該主人在此搜索時期。是否能達到目的。尙未可知云。</p>
<h3>諾比列氏北極探險之回憶</h3>
<p>— 素心</p>
<p>意大利探險家諾比列氏。以俄京盛傳一九二八年同往北極探險而未能生還之阿孟曾氏。現尙生存於極地。因聨合各國著名探險家。於七月十八日。自俄境之阿堪遮港。乘俄國碎冰船馬利金號。駛往北極探索究竟。滬上各種西報。莫不爭載其事。茲爲求讀者明瞭此事之來源起見。爰將一九二八年之一段北極探險慘史。略述如下。</p>
<p>當一九二八年四月間。探險家諾比列氏。組織北極探險團。乘飛艇意大利號飛向北極探險。詎一去消息沉沉。。及兩星期後。莫斯科無線電台。始接得該團求助之消息。蘇俄政府。乃下令組織救護隊。派遣碎冰船馬利金號。於是年六月十二日。駛往北極營救。旋因工作困難。收效不易。俄政府又復派世界最堅銳之碎冰船克拉新號往助之。</p>
<p>旣至北極。即在冰天雪地中來往搜索。歷時甚久。迄無所獲。最後乃用携去之三動機飛艇。飛往搜尋。久之。已在「七島」地方。發現意大利號之遺跡。擬飛回克拉新停泊之處報告。忽被大霧所阻。遂不得不降落該島。但因降落時稍有不愼。機身突然損壞。急發無線電信號求助。克拉新得悉後。即開足速力。向數千萬年不溶之冰海中駛去。最後幸已達到目的地。並將凍餒欲斃之諾比列氏救起。</p>
<p>於是克拉新即向挪威駛回。途中適遇德國環游世界大遊船遇險。勢將下沉。克拉新復前往援救之。船中一千六百乘客之生命。遂得安然脫險。克拉新旣安抵挪威後。因探悉諾比列探險團在北極時。已分成三隊前進。如阿孟曾氏等。尙被困極。因於同年八月十一日。再至北極探索餘人踪跡。歷時六星期。毫無端倪。祇得廢然而返。（聞巴黎大戲院近日開映之「北極之秘密。」即演述此事。容俟參看。）</p>
<h3>印度遊記（七二）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>三號學校停課。工人罷工。爲新年節之塗彩運動塗彩者。用五色水及紅粉。或塗粉於面。或洒水於身。互相行禮也。從此日始。凡三日行之男。塗男。女塗女。而頑童則用水缾或水槍互相放射。渾身盡濕。一人相遇。則塗面一次。若一日遇十人百人。則塗無數次。頭髮鬚盡成紅紫。其狀可想而知也。衣服必須換。不能着新衣。有時濕如水雞。頭面如藍鬼然。行之不倦。大家以爲笑樂。抑印人狀貌若加以彩色塗之。中國人見之自是可驚。不過其種族不一。或黑或白或紅鬍者。據學生言。其居北部近雲山者。色白。居南部熱帶者色黑。由天氣然也。其歷史言。歐洲阿利安人。乃自印度西去者。與歐人本同種也。印度婦女貧者殊難與華人比美。然吾决不敢輕視。印女爲佛母。彼能産生佛也。</p>
<p>印人種初自西北部南移。其地界乎回部及帕米爾各地之間。爲奔乍普省即拉好地方。今總督從加市移居得利。乃奔乍普省之東南角。蓋地居恒河上游。民風强悍。當回部之衝。故總督移居之。據道階師言。古時元朝所建莫臥兒國。即都得利也。按印度史希臘時代。亞力山大東征到奔乍普省。得印度美術傳於希獵。又波斯王大流士亦征印度。其兵皆從奔乍普東下。然則奔乍普省乃西北之門戶矣。印度歷史。歷代爲外人所據。由其沈於宗敎哲理。民馴良而好善以致弱也。世界人較有良心者。莫印度若矣。學生等語我。吾印人爲宗敎人生之民族。第一先講信仰。後講人生生命。吾寗可死。而不可改吾信仰也。吾等亦知俄國主義甚好。但其反對宗敎。故不宜於印度。余按印度猶太純爲宗敎之民族。故皆亡其國。歐美之唯物主義。乃物生主義。之民族也。中國乃民生主義之民族也。印度乃人生或神生主義之民族也。物生神生均非人所最宜。比較研究將來執全球文化之中道者。其爲我中華乎。雖然。此非保守舊派之說。乃折衷進化而更新之說也。印人言吾國歷史。亦不可靠因歷來被各族所吞併如波斯人回敎人英人每次來侵入。殺人無數。今日作歷史者。不敢詳紀亦不便追想。以增惡感故歷史書止是表面耳。余告之言雄性互殺。亦不止異種之間。如中國之黄巢張獻忠。又何嘗異族乎。世界有戰爭。即有殺戮。印人亦不必一一回憶眞史也。</p>

<h3>女人女人（七）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>好媳婦！不是你說起我倒也忘了。就是這樣吧！省得呌小榮的爸爸爲難。只是，小榮！你得記住了：你讀書的錢來得眞不容易呢！」他的母親說·小榮暗暗暗地快樂，表面上還得做出很感激的樣子。不一刻，一雙金鐲子已經拿了出來，一支金簪和一對金耳環也從他母親的頭上卸了下來，另外還有十四塊雪白的銀洋，都交在小榮的手裏。八隻眼睛都出神地注視着，他們四個人中間的各自的情緒是複雜到極點了。小榮却暗暗地打算着這幾件金器的價值，還自己欣幸着這幾天金價飛漲，三件東西至少可以換上一百二十塊大洋。</p>
<p>「還少哩！大槪還得少二十塊大洋，怎麽樣呢？」小榮居然已有着不滿足的表示。</p>
<p>他的母親和妻子這才着急了。「能不能將就將就呢？這一些你先去付了。以後再得想法啊。」伊們倆同聲地說。</p>
<p>「這是不行的！爸爸能不能想個法兒呢？」小榮的眼睛注視在他的父親的臉上</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>他的父親摸摸自己的錢袋，一聲也不響，好像是很慚愧又很着急。最後才想起了有十塊錢擺在床上的褥子下面，也祗好拿出來凑一凑數了。</p>
<p>從鄭重的狀態中，把十塊大洋捧了出來，他手也顫了，終於交到了小榮的手裏。他說：「兩個月的房錢，還没有付，要是他們就來收取，祇好搪塞着幾天再說了。」</p>
<p>小榮也覺能不能再有更多的說話了。一烟屋子裏四個人才又恢復了比較快樂的狀態。小榮把三件金器打做一包塞在裏，面的衣袋裏還有二十四塊大洋也袋了起來，那鏗然的聲音，給屋子外面的那個小夥計聽得了還以爲是小榮在上海發了財回來哩，</p>
<p>小夥計果然走進來了，對着小榮露出非常敬羨的神色。一邊，他就說；「老閭丨車子收拾好了，馬也架上了，要不要去趕中午的快車？」</p>
<p>「好！就去吧！」小榮的父親立起身來，望望小榮，好像有許多的話要說而又說不出的樣子，終於跟着小夥計一同出去了。</p>
<p>「那麽，爸爸，帶我一同走吧！我還來得及回上海啊！」小榮突然地說。他的父親也就回了進來。</p>
<p>「怎麽？你就要回上海？便一天，也得留一天啊！」小榮的妻子似乎有些失望了。</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Vocational Education</h3>
<p>Vocational education has two meanings: a broad sense and a narrow sense. As stated in the aims of the Chinese Vocational Education Association, these are: preparing individuals for making a living; preparing individuals for serving society; and preparing the nation and the world for increasing productivity. The latter is the broad sense, while the former two are the narrow sense.</p>
<p>The purpose of education is not only to solve individual problems or local problems, but primarily to solve the entire problem. The purpose of vocational education is exactly the same. Today, there are numerous fundamental problems presenting themselves to us, such as population, politics, and economics, all intertwined, preventing society from returning to normalcy and preventing vocational problems from achieving a reasonable status. Broadly defined vocational education employs the great power of education to educate the entire society in solving these complex and contradictory problems, stabilizing its order, and expressing its functions, guiding society towards a new and constructive path of development, and ensuring that people's skills learning and employment both have estimable goals, enabling them to be reasonably resolved. All unemployed individuals can find work, and further enhance the productivity of society. This, then, is vocational education in its broad sense.</p>
<p>Narrowly defined vocational education focuses on (1) educating people that having a vocation is essential and making them aware of the honor of having a vocation and the shamefulness of having none; (2) educating people about the meaning of a vocation as a mutual exchange of abilities and needs between individuals and society. Society has a need for building houses, and individuals have the ability to build houses. Individuals have a need for food and clothing, and society has the ability to provide food and clothing. Only then is the establishment of the construction industry possible. If people understand this principle, they can identify emerging vocations in light of the prospects for societal progress and the trends of the times; (3) educating people to be self-aware and self-selecting, so that before entering school, they can study according to their talents, and after employment, they can use what they have learned. People can develop their talents to the fullest, and everyone can find their proper place; (4) educating people to use their brains and hands simultaneously, to seek knowledge and experience, to be able to integrate them and help each other. For example, students who primarily use their brains should be encouraged to use their hands, and farmers and workers who primarily use their hands should be encouraged to use their brains, so that the entire nation can both know and do; (5) educating people on how to serve faithfully after employment, how to develop an interest in their vocation, so that they can enjoy their work and increase their efficiency; (6) educating people to apply new scientific methods to improve old vocations. For example, the old seventy-two trades of our country can all become tools for livelihood if scientific improvements are made. At the same time, educate factories, stores, and shops with new scientific management methods, eliminating old abuses and bad habits. The above six points are all part of vocational education in its narrow sense.</p>
<p>Although the broad and narrow senses have slightly different meanings, the two are, in fact, closely and inseparably related. Solving individual problems leads to solving societal problems, and solving societal problems is precisely the way to solve individual problems. Ultimately, they all aim at a reasonable solution to the problem of people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Today, it is undoubtedly true that vocational education is a major driving force for improving society and the people's livelihood. It should also be commonly recognized by us as an active and effective method for saving our country from poverty. The gentlemen of the Vocational Education Association have accumulated fourteen years of arduous effort and achieved initial success today. Looking back on the past and anticipating the future, the reporter sincerely wishes them to continue their doubled efforts to achieve even greater success. There is a couplet in the association's hall that says, "Confucius did not say, 'Wishing to establish oneself, one should help others to establish themselves; wishing to achieve success, one should help others to achieve success.' This can be said to be the way of the benevolent. We originally thought this way: to enable the unemployed to have employment and to enable the employed to enjoy their employment. What other problems are there?" These words are truly on point. Indeed, if everyone from a country to the world has a job and enjoys their job, then everyone has life and enjoys life. What disputes and problems would still exist in the universe? This is not difficult. The key lies in our continued efforts from now on.</p>

<h3>German Finance</h3>
<h3>Hope for Early Recovery</h3>
<p>Preventing Inflation</p>
<p>Bank Interest Rates Increased</p>
<p>Government Prepares to Lift Restrictions on Payments</p>
<p>Minting New Silver Coins Will Not Affect Silver Prices</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 31st – German bank interest rates are currently at 15 percent, and borrowing rates have increased to 20 percent. The bank's increase in interest rates was not sudden. The national bank published an article stating that this drastic step had been discussed long ago but had been delayed due to concerns that it would adversely affect agriculture and industry. It is hoped that this move will allow the current financial restrictions to become completely free, so that lower interest rates can be restored as soon as possible. On approximately August 1st, the government will issue another temporary emergency order, increasing the amount of withdrawals from current accounts. It is expected that financial operations can be restored on August 5th.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 31st – Germany's minting of new silver coins worth 100 million marks will not affect silver prices because Germany has six mints and a large stock of silver bars, sufficient to meet the needs of coin minting. The Minister of Finance anticipated the need to mint silver coins early and secretly purchased silver bars at the then-market price several weeks ago. At that time, the silver market did not rise as a result. Yesterday, the price of silver was 39.25 marks per thousand grams. The national bank will circulate these new silver coins in the market, and the interest earned from the minting will go to the Ministry of Finance. The new silver coins are 50% pure silver and 50% copper.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin – Germany's largest bank, the Dresdner Bank, was maintained by the government today. It was decided to add capital and issue preferred stock, with the national treasury subscribing to 80 million marks. In addition, the newly established Guarantee and Acceptance Bank will subscribe.</p>

It was also stipulated to equalize the distribution of gold coins around the world. It is reported that the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States is also a party to the agreement.</p>
<h3>British Parliament Adjourns</h3>
<p>Can be Convened at Any Time in Case of Important Political Affairs</p>
<p>Striving for Economy in the Face of Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Increased Taxes to Make Up for Budget Deficit</p>
<p>National Expenditure Survey Committee Issues Report</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 1st – The British Parliament adjourned for the summer this afternoon and will reopen on October 20th. However, before adjourning, both houses passed a bill authorizing the speakers to convene Parliament at any time with the approval of the government in case of important political affairs. This bill was established in light of the current serious international financial situation. A similar bill was also passed in 1924 for the Irish border issue.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 31st – The British government today published the National Expenditure Survey Committee report, which listed many economy suggestions, with the amount saved totaling 96.5 million pounds. For example, immediately selling or dismantling the large airship R100, and reducing unemployment insurance relief by 20%, saving 66.5 million pounds; road construction costs saving 7.865 million pounds; military salaries and allowances being paid according to the 1925 amount, saving 2.19 million pounds; police salaries reduced by 12.5%, saving 929,000 pounds, etc. Wherever possible, cuts were made. The report stated that after the implementation of the proposed measures, the expenses saved could offset a portion of the 120 million pounds expected to be insufficient in the budget. Although the budget is expected to be so insufficient, even with efforts to economize on expenses, there will still be a need to increase taxes.</p>
<p>Briand</p>
<h3>Frail and Unable to Handle the Stress</h3>
<p>Attacks of Asthma Require Long-Term Rest</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs to be Handled Concurrently by Laval</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 31st – French Foreign Minister Briand, on the advice of his doctor, has left Paris for his villa in Cauchy, Normandy, for a long-term rest. Briand's health has deteriorated significantly since his failure in the last presidential election. Even in recent months, Briand's activities in international diplomacy have not been as vigorous as before. Briand's illness is said to be asthma, which has become more frequent recently, greatly affecting his heart. As a result, doctors have told him not to smoke anymore, but Briand's fondness for cigarettes is very deep. For fifty years, he has smoked at least sixty cigarettes a day. Now, being forbidden to smoke due to illness makes life even more unbearable, and his mental state has become increasingly depressed. Although Foreign Ministry officials say that Briand's illness can be recovered with a little rest, it is feared that with his weak body at his advanced age, he will be unable to handle the stress of diplomacy, and he will soon be sixty years old next year, and he will probably retire soon. Now that Briand is on vacation, Prime Minister Laval is in charge of all foreign affairs, as foreign affairs have long been in Laval's hands, so there is not much change.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Telegram from Nanchang: To all newspapers, I have just sent a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, which reads: "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang, reading your telegram, I am inexplicably moved and inspired. Ever since the completion of unification, conflicts have repeatedly arisen. Just as the suppression of the bandits was progressing smoothly, rebellions have broken out again. Shi Yousan is inherently a fickle villain, incomparably cunning and treacherous, and absurd to the extreme. From obstructing the reorganization of the army to supporting the Red change, he has harbored treacherous intentions and is willing to be a chieftain of the rebels. The Central Government has been tolerant again and again, but the rebel has not shown any awareness. Such retrograde behavior, self-isolation from humanity, destroying the nation's vitality, and harming the nation's lifeblood are extremely evil and heinous, and the people of the country all say that he should be killed. Your Excellency has led the revolution and experienced the difficulties of many twists and turns. You have commanded the army through the heat of summer, and you have been deeply concerned about the chaos day and night. Yingqin and others are bound by the mission, following your lead. The great righteousness has been declared to the four seas, and the loyalty and indignation are especially displayed in the six armies. At this time of much worry and difficulty, we pledge to continue our efforts, lead the army south, and achieve the merit of sweeping the court of rebellion. Turning the army north, we will reap the effect of beheading the ugly rebels. The loyal and the rebellious cannot coexist, and right and wrong cannot be confused. Supporting the Central Government is all our comrades. Rebels against the Party and the country are enemies. Success or failure, we are of one mind. We are quick to act and full of spirit in the three armies. We love justice to correct people's hearts and exterminate the fierce and stubborn to secure the Party and the country.</p>
<p>We will obey your Excellency's orders. We respectfully send this telegram, hoping that you will consider it." We still hope that everyone will rise up together and jointly punish the rebels, so that the country can be stable and secure for generations to come. Respectfully, He Yingqin, Chen Mingshu, Lu Diping, Zhu Shaoliang, Sun Lianzhong, Jiang Guangnai, Jiang Dingwen, Zhao Guantao, Chen Cheng, Shangguan Yunxiang, Tan Daoyuan, Hao Mengling, Wei Lihuang, Gao Shuxun, Lu Xiaochen, Zhou Hunyuan, Mao Bingwen, Luo Zhuoying, Li Yunjie, Xu Kexiang, Gong Bingfan, Guo Huazong, Han Deqin, Li Yunheng, Ruan Zhaochang, Cai Tingkai, Shen Guanghan, Mao Weishou, Qu Shounian, Zhang Zhen, Liu Heding, Luo Lin, Zhu Xihuang, Qiu Zhaochen, Tang Enyou, Liu Yi, Ma Kuntong respectfully salute.</p>
<p>Telegram from Kaifeng: To all newspapers, we have received Commander-in-Chief Chiang's telegram and respectfully replied in a telegram today, which reads: "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Nanchang, having received your telegram stating that the Red bandits, warlords, and traitors are colluding with imperialists and attacking together, you have exhorted the people of the country to fight for internal peace and external resistance with a spirit of perseverance. Your sincerity for the country is earnest and heartfelt. Not only those who are armed and carrying weapons should serve the country, but even those who are learned and experienced are inspired by the news. We believe that for twenty years, the warlords and imperialists have colluded with each other, acting like wolves in league. The imperialists supplied the warlords with ammunition and funds, fueling our internal chaos, exacerbating their aggression, and leaving the solemn and magnificent China almost in a position of no return. Now, with the Red bandits, who are even worse than floods and fierce beasts, wreaking havoc in Fujian and Jiangxi, it is a threat to the very core of the country, and it is truly only a matter of time before the country falls. Fortunately, your Excellency, undaunted by the heat and hardship, personally directs the campaign in Jiangxi Province and launches a major offensive. We thought that the internal chaos would be quelled and then we could resist foreign aggression. Unexpectedly, some traitorous warlords, instigated by the Red bandits and imperialists, are undermining unification and obstructing peace. The hearts of the people are dead, which is regrettable. We have always heard that the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every individual. We are among the ranks of soldiers and how can we fall behind others? We pledge to exhaust our meager abilities and follow your lead.</p>
<p>We are training our horses and preparing our weapons, launching a major crusade, and we will ensure that the Red bandits, warlords, and traitors are completely eliminated. The imperialists must restrain their ambitions and strive for survival, and our commitment will never change, regardless of success or failure. We respectfully present our sentiments and humbly request your consideration." Respectfully, Zhang Fang, Song Tiancai, Wang Diange, Han Wenying, Shi Keqin, Wang Lingyun, Li Wanru, Li Wanmo, Fan Feizhang, and others respectfully salute. We hereby send this telegram for your information.</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>A Study of Korean Immigration to the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Continuation 10) Bin.</p>
<p>(6) Our Country's Future Countermeasures</p>
<p>The previous sections have detailed the conspiracy of Japanese colonization of Korean immigrants and the persecution of our country's economy and people's livelihoods by Korean immigration. Here, we can clearly understand the thoroughness of the Japanese imperialists' plot against us, the insidious nature of their methods, and the seriousness of the Korean issue. Under these circumstances, what countermeasures should our country take to eliminate this hidden danger in our hearts? This is a major issue that the people of our country should discuss urgently. The author has consulted current opinions and, based on my humble views, briefly presents several points as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Negotiate for the Thorough Withdrawal of Japanese Troops and Police Stationed in the Northeast. The number of Japanese troops stationed in our Northeast is impossible to ascertain, as they maintain strict secrecy and refuse investigation. However, judging from the troops under the command of the so-called "Kwantung Army Headquarters," "Stationed Division," "Independent Garrison Unit," "Port Arthur Fortress Headquarters," and "Kwantung Military Police," the number is already considerable. Moreover, wherever Korean immigrants arrive, Japan immediately sets up police stations under the pretext of protection and secretly increases its troops. When combined, the number is even more alarming. Furthermore, where Japanese troops are stationed, there are always installations such as artillery emplacements, observation posts, airfields, and wired and wireless communications. The strength of their military equipment makes us shudder. Our country's territory is allowing foreign iron cavalry to be stationed for a long time. This is dangerous. It is not merely a matter of others sleeping soundly next to our beds. Setting aside the greater and more far-reaching harms, the infringement of our national rights and the repeated shootings of our citizens are intolerable for an independent country. In the recent Wanpaoshan incident, Japanese police and soldiers used the pretext of protecting Korean immigrants to station themselves in the area for a long time, protecting Korean immigrants in digging rivers and building dams, and opening fire with rifles, strafing our farmers, using force to implement their colonial policies. This is even more blatant. Therefore, for the sake of consolidating our national defense, safeguarding our national rights, and protecting the livelihoods and lives of our people, our government should seriously negotiate with Japan, demanding the withdrawal of troops and police stationed in various parts of our Northeast within a time limit. This will prevent unruly Koreans from finding protection and avoid endless disputes in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Strictly Prohibit Korean Immigration and Rectify the Nationality of Korean Residents. The Korean immigrants residing in our Northeast include those who have joined Japanese nationality, those who have joined our nationality, those who are stateless, and those who hold dual Chinese and Japanese nationality. They live in mixed communities, making management extremely difficult. The Japanese take advantage of this confusion to manipulate matters and carry out their insidious schemes. Therefore, strictly prohibiting Korean immigration and rectifying the nationality of Korean residents in the country are essential tasks. This year's National Internal Affairs Conference passed resolutions on this matter: (1) Korean immigrants who have resided in China for more than ten years, are of good character, and have substantial employment should be persuaded to apply for naturalization in accordance with Chinese nationality law, so that they will obey Chinese laws for ease of management. (2) In order to prevent the increase of Korean immigrants, provincial and municipal governments must strictly control the entry of Korean immigrants. Except for those who come with Japanese nationality and should be dealt with in accordance with the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, such dangerous elements must not be allowed to enter non-treaty ports or fraudulently obtain our public and private rights. (3) In areas with Korean residents, municipal and county governments must conduct registration of Korean immigrants who have not been naturalized as soon as possible. Those who do not register will be treated as Japanese and dealt with in accordance with the Sino-Japanese Treaty. (4) Detailed regulations on the public and private rights of naturalized Korean immigrants should be perfected. Unfortunately, although the resolutions were passed long ago, they have not yet been implemented.</p>
<p>(3) Strictly Prohibit Chinese Citizens from Privately Selling Land. The Japanese originally had no right to purchase land in our Northeast. Although Article 1 on the right to lease land for commercial purposes was proposed in the unreasonable Twenty-One Demands of 1915, our country has never recognized this treaty of national subjugation. However, because Korean immigrants are good at cultivating paddy fields, they rent land in various parts of the Northeast to grow rice. They obtain high profits, and our farmers can also receive higher rents than for dry land. Furthermore, because they are remnants of a fallen country with no means of livelihood, they are allowed to rent land for cultivation as a gesture of compassion for those displaced. Strict regulations are in place for the land rental system. For example, the rental of paddy fields and other lands by Korean immigrants must be approved by the local county government. The term of the tenancy agreement was changed from five years to three years, and later shortened to one year. However, the Japanese are doing their utmost to undermine these regulations and are using various means to entice our farmers to privately mortgage their land to Korean immigrants, who then transfer it to Japanese. Once the land falls into the hands of the Japanese, they use sophistry and deny the sale, refusing to allow our farmers to redeem it. This kind of transfer has allowed the Japanese to hold a large amount of land in our Northeast, causing enormous losses to our farmers and severely infringing upon our national rights. Moreover, disputes are numerous and unresolved cases are piling up. Therefore, the authorities in our Northeast should strictly prohibit Chinese citizens from privately renting or transferring land to foreigners. Furthermore, in accordance with the principle in the resolution of the National Internal Affairs Conference that "in order to prevent our citizens from privately renting or selling land to Korean immigrants, regulations should be established to punish the unauthorized sale or rental of national land as a warning," various regulations should be formulated and strictly enforced.</p>
<p>(4) Actively Encourage Immigration from the Interior to the Northeast. According to the survey conducted by the Northeast local government, Liaoning Province has a land area of 1,154,073 square li and a population of 16,366,175. Jilin Province has a land area of 1,318,650 square li and a population of 7,339,944. Heilongjiang has the largest land area of 2,292,135 square li but the smallest population of only 3,655,590. Based on this, the population density is 14.1 people per square li in Liaoning Province, 5.6 in Jilin Province, and 1.7 in Heilongjiang Province, which is far different from the average population density of 25 people per square li in the eighteen provinces of the interior. Moreover, there is a vast amount of uncultivated land in the Northeast. In Liaoning Province, 60 to 70 percent of the land in the former Jerim League, which belonged to the Taochang Circuit, remains uncultivated. In Jilin, most of the land remains uncultivated except for the counties of Changchun, Jilin, Nong'an, Dehui, Shuangcheng, Binjiang, and Acheng. In Heilongjiang, 70 to 80 percent of the land remains uncultivated except for the areas along the Hu-Hai line and near Anda. Such a vast expanse of land is close to a strong neighbor. If we do not actively immigrate and cultivate, our emptiness will be exploited by others. How can we avoid being coveted by a strong neighbor? Therefore, actively encouraging immigration from the interior to populate the frontier is a wise strategy to develop our resources, prevent encroachment, and alleviate population pressure in the interior provinces.</p>
<p>Historically, our people's immigration to the Northeast has not achieved much success. According to the following table, the number of people who immigrated to the Northeast from our interior provinces between 1924 and 1927 was as follows:</p>
<p>Year　　Dalian Landing Yingkou Landing　　Andong Arrival　　Beining Railway Arrival　　Total</p>
<p>1924　　167,206 61,904 32,641 210,719 491,470</p>
<p>1925　　197,392 96,647 40,740 197,922 551,770</p>
<p>1926　　267,062 124,745 48,287 167,260 607,552</p>
<p>1927　　610,374 149,318 47,676 231,928 1,140,246</p>
<p>The table shows that the number of people immigrating to the Northeast from the interior seems to increase annually, but according to the South Manchuria Railway survey, between 1923 and 1929, more than 4.8 million immigrants entered, while more than 2.12 million exited, a retention rate of 44 percent. This is something we should pay close attention to. Korean immigrants can settle in our territory, while our citizens return. The reason for this is that Korean immigrants are assisted by Japan's comprehensive colonial policies, while our government has largely failed to have precise and comprehensive plans for immigration from the interior provinces. As a result, many immigrants from the interior provinces are unable to survive after arriving in the Northeast and have no choice but to leave the Northeast and wander in all directions. Therefore, our authorities should pay close attention to improving immigration policies, actively encouraging immigration, forcibly relocating refugees, and devising appropriate plans for their livelihoods so that they can settle down and not return after leaving.</p>
<p>(5) Convert the Four Counties of Yanbian into Special Regions. The Japanese are gradually implementing their plans to annex the four counties of Yanji, Hunchun, Helong, and Wangqing in Jilin Province. They have established seven consulates and seven police stations in these four counties, with approximately 110,000 soldiers and military police stationed there. More than 2,000 police officers have been assigned. They have secretly moved the Sino-Korean boundary markers in the Tumen River and named Yanji as Jiandao, Wangqing as North Jiandao, Hunchun as East Jiandao, and Helong as South Jiandao. They collectively refer to our four counties of Yanbian as Jiandao, revealing their ambition to annex them. According to statistics from March of this year, the number of Koreans in these four counties has reached more than 500,000, accounting for 70 to 80 percent of the residents. Because of the large number and the mix of good and bad elements, disputes are particularly numerous. The local administrative supervision is limited. It seems difficult to adequately handle the heavy responsibility of governing the frontier. Therefore, for the sake of protecting our territory and defending our people, the four counties of Yanbian can be converted into special regions, and high-ranking officials can be dispatched with heavy troops to be stationed there, so as to prevent strong neighbors from coveting and losing our territory invisibly.</p>
<p>(6) Establish a Korean Immigrant Administration Bureau. In the resolution of last year's National Internal Affairs Conference, it was proposed to establish a Korean Immigrant Administration Bureau at an appropriate location in Yanbian to vigorously implement a policy of assimilation for naturalized Korean immigrants, actively promote the education of the national language and literature, and impart historical knowledge to promote their national consciousness. This proposal is also an effective countermeasure and should be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>This is all I have to say. In short, the Korean immigrant issue in the Northeast did not begin today. Accumulated illnesses and diseases have gradually become hidden dangers in our hearts. Today, the signs of disaster are obvious. If we do not seek remedies quickly, with the rapid advance of the Japanese and the desperation of the Koreans, the disasters will be unimaginable. Tanaka Giichi's conspiracy has now been fully manifested in reality. Thinking of the future makes us shudder. Our government should take decisive measures and implement emergency countermeasures to remove the root of the disaster before it is too late. If we continue to sit idly by, the roots will be deeply entrenched, and this problem will never be solved. Furthermore, since Korea fell, its people have been displaced. Except for a few people with lofty ideals who are urgently seeking to restore their country, the majority of Korean immigrants have no choice but to rely on our country, Japan, or Russia. Relying on Japan or Russia means being used by them to invade our borders, which is detrimental to us. If we can properly handle and strictly manage them, these displaced remnants can all be strong men who develop our Northeast resources. Moreover, this is in line with our country's intention to support weak nations. All of this should be considered by our government, our people, and our citizens when discussing the resolution of the Korean immigrant issue today. (The End)</p>

<h3>Baoding During Wartime</h3>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Talks About the War Being Settled in Half a Month</p>
<p>Zhang Huanxiang Discusses the State of Air Force Operations</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Baoding, Yu Xuezhong, the commander of the First Northeast Army, arrived in Baoding at approximately 5:00 AM on the 22nd. According to Yu's statement to the local press, Shi Yousan is in an isolated position with 60,000 troops. More than twelve divisions of the Central Army have advanced to the area of Cixian. Our forces on the Pinghan Railway also number 150,000 to 160,000. The air force is also flying to the front lines from time to time. Han Fuju, Sun Dianying, and the generals of Shanxi and Suiyuan have all expressed their obedience to the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander, supporting the Central Government. Pay for the Shanxi forces and Sun's troops is being distributed. Therefore, it is predicted that the war will not be prolonged and that the situation can be cleared up within half a month. At 4:00 AM on the 25th, Yu, accompanied by Chief of Staff Liu Zhonggan, Director Wen Nianzhong, Adjutant Li Junxiang, and more than ten others from the headquarters, went to Wangdu on the second armored train of the Northeast Army to inspect the defense. They arrived at Wangdu Station at 6:30 AM. On the train, Yu convened a meeting of the brigade commanders Bai Fengxiang, Du Jiwu, Dong Yingbin, Li Zhentang, and Chen Guanqun to discuss and determine the defense plan. It was decided that the three brigades of Du Jiwu, Chen Guanqun, and Dong Yingbin would be responsible for the railway front, Bai's brigade would coordinate the two flanks, and Li Zhentang would be the rear guard. After the meeting, Commander Yu and the brigade commanders personally inspected the defense line and expressed great satisfaction. Yu himself will move to Fangshun Bridge on a special train after contact with the front lines. At approximately 8:00 AM, after completing the inspection, he returned to Baoding on the armored train at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>Zhang Huanxiang, commander of the Air Force, arrived in Ping on a plane. At 8:40 AM on the 25th, he arrived in Baoding on a new-style small Morse aircraft. He met with Yu Xuezhong at noon and summoned the captains, squad leaders, and pilots in the afternoon to discuss the bombing of Shi's army in detail. At 4:00 PM, a reporter visited the Air Force Command at the airfield. Zhang told the reporter that he came to Baoding to inspect the air force's combat operations. After arriving in Baoding, he met with the members and asked them in detail. Personally, he claimed to have no talent in aviation, but he believed that the country's purpose in establishing aviation was to unanimously resist foreign aggression. Using it in the civil war was truly regrettable. However, Shi Yousan disrupted peace and hindered unification. It was necessary to mobilize the air force to participate. The Northeast Army's aircraft participating in the operation numbered 34. Twenty-nine of them were used for reconnaissance and combat, while the rest were used for communication. After arriving in Ping, he had not yet met with Deputy Commander Zhang. An Air Force Command has now been organized in Peiping. After completing the inspection, he will return to Peiping on the original plane. The estimated flight time is 57 minutes. Squads 1 and 2 of the Northeast Army's aircraft formed a mixed team and set off at 4:00 AM on the 25th to attack Shijiazhuang. After arriving in Shijiazhuang, they dropped more than 30 bombs on the railway station, South Main Street, and Shengping Street, killing many of Shi's soldiers. The First Army Command also sent staff officers Fang Huating and Zhao Yong to the front lines to distribute leaflets, offering a reward of 50,000 yuan for the killing of Shi Yousan.</p>
<p>Currently, the front line of the Northeast Army is on the north bank of the Hutuo River in Zhengdingfu. The defensive works are very complete. The final line of defense is in the Wangdu area, where trenches one zhang wide and eight or nine chi deep have been dug. They stretch approximately one hundred li from west to east. They were all dug by farmers and villagers. Most of the villagers along the trenches have been evacuated. Therefore, the number of refugees in Baoding City and various counties is already overwhelming, and the number of young girls with long braids is especially large. Refugees from Wangdu, Wan, Tang, and Mancheng are still arriving in an endless stream. Baoding's commerce is greatly weakened by the military's influence. Taking the cloth and rayon from Gaoyang County as an example, they are all transshipped from Baoding to various parts of the country, but due to inconvenient transportation, the goods are piled up like mountains. Commerce is weak, and workers are suffering from unemployment. For example, the most prosperous stores, such as Qingfengyi, Wensheng, and Huaimao, used to sell more than a thousand yuan worth of goods per day, but now they only sell dozens or hundreds of yuan. In terms of security, the Railway Workers' Union reported that committee members Liu Qinghe and Han Fengxiang, in view of the precarious situation, feared that reactionary elements and communist partisans would incite workers to sabotage railway administration. They convened a meeting of all workers to explain the great principles, inform them of the advantages and disadvantages, and strictly prevent any incidents. In addition, the military authorities have built a motor vehicle road from Baoding to Ping and a road from Baoding to the two counties of Wantang. Both are three zhang wide and were built by villagers and workers along the roads. The loss of crops is also considerable. The bridges along the Pinghan Railway from Peiping to Zhengding are heavily guarded to prevent sabotage by reactionaries.</p>
<p>Investigation Report on Korean Cases</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Overseas Chinese in Gyeongseong, Chinnampo, and Sinuiju</h3>
<p>Dispatch from Incheon. I went to Chinnampo early on the 24th, Gyeongseong on the 25th, and arrived in Incheon on the 26th to investigate the situation of the overseas Chinese. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Overseas Chinese in Gyeongseong. There were originally more than 7,000 overseas Chinese in Gyeongseong. Among them, approximately 2,000 were engaged in commerce, more than 3,000 were farmers, and others were laborers. After the incident, more than 4,000 were taken into the Consulate General, and the rest returned home by boat from Incheon. After the situation calmed down, the vegetable farmers found that their gardens had been destroyed by the Koreans, and they had no means of maintaining their livelihoods. As a result, four-fifths of them returned home. The laborers also had no work to do. They were advised by the General Chamber of Commerce to return to their home country. The shops, except for the larger ones, did not have much capital. After suffering this damage, they were unable to recover, and many also returned home. Therefore, the number of overseas Chinese currently residing in Gyeongseong is less than 1,000 in the city and approximately 800 in the countryside, a decrease of three-fifths compared to before the tragedy. Although the shops have reopened as usual, there are few customers. In addition to uniting to boycott Chinese merchants and refusing to purchase goods sold by Chinese merchants, the Japanese and Koreans are also spreading rumors about the Chinese food that they used to enjoy, claiming that the Chinese have poisoned it to retaliate. Therefore, only 30 of the 110 Chinese restaurants are open, but business is slow, and the place is deserted. Overseas Chinese who work as laborers and vegetable farmers have no money to return home. Several of them go to the Chamber of Commerce every day to ask for relief. The General Chamber of Commerce tries to send them to Incheon, and the Incheon Chamber of Commerce negotiates with the shipping companies to transport them back to Yantai at half price. The Osaka General Chamber of Commerce remitted 2,000 Japanese yen to Gyeongseong for relief, and the Osaka Beibang Public Office remitted 4,770.20 yuan. Other Japanese and Korean public organizations in Gyeongseong expressed their sympathy and donated goods and money worth approximately 2,000 yuan. These were distributed by the Gyeongseong General Chamber of Commerce to Incheon, Pyongyang, Wonsan, and other places. After the incident, Gyeonggi Province sent 1,000 yuan in relief money, which was rejected by the General Chamber of Commerce. In addition, the Chamber of Commerce politely declined donations from various Japanese government offices. Gyeongseong, as the location of the Governor-General of Korea,</p>
<h3>Japanese Police in Pyongyang Assist Koreans in Tearing Down Goods</h3>
<p>Although Koreans still despise overseas Chinese who have not left the country, they have not taken any excessive actions out of consideration for the Japanese authorities. Overseas Chinese in the countryside may still be beaten. Vegetable farmers mostly work in the countryside during the day and return to the city at night for safety. On July 26, 500 overseas Chinese from Wonsan returned home by train because they could not make a living locally. Before departure, the Wonsan Consulate and Chamber of Commerce informed the Gyeongseong Consulate General and Chamber of Commerce by telegram to request assistance in returning home. Gong Heting, Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, went to see the Director of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Korean Governor-General's Office to request free train tickets for 500 people to transfer to Andong from Gyeongseong. The Japanese side refused. After much negotiation, they agreed to reduce the fare by half. If they wanted it to be completely free, they could receive a comfort payment of 1,000 yuan from Gyeonggi Province, which would be used to pay for half-price train tickets. The railway authorities would not suffer any losses, and the Chinese side would not spend a penny. Gong refused because our government had clearly ordered not to receive any money from Japanese government offices. In the end, the association bought half-price tickets, costing 2,038.25 yuan. Among them, 136 people transferred to Incheon from Gyeongseong and took the Kyodo Maru on July 28 to return home. The Incheon Chamber of Commerce paid for the tickets.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Overseas Chinese in Incheon. The nature of overseas Chinese in Incheon is fluid. Because it is very close to Yantai and Weihai in our country, overseas Chinese can come and go freely. Therefore, there are no statistics. Before the incident, there were approximately 6,000 people, more than 3,000 of whom were laborers, more than 1,000 were vegetable farmers, and the rest were merchants. The shops in the Korean street were all destroyed. Currently, two-fifths of them are barely back in business. The business is as slow as in Gyeongseong. The shops in Chinatown (i.e., Chinese Street) reopened on July 11. Koreans agreed not to shop in Chinese stores in Chinatown. Reopening is the same as not reopening. Therefore, since July 5, the indirect losses of various businesses have been incalculable. Most of them have returned home because they are hopeless and fear the dangers ahead. At present, there are approximately 900 merchants, but only 600 laborers and approximately 500 vegetable farmers.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Incheon Return Home by Ship in Succession</h3>
<h2>Page 13</h2>
<p>Continued Important News</p>
<p>Because it is very dangerous for workers to stay in the Korean street, they all live in the shelters set up by the Chamber of Commerce. The shelters are part of the former consulate and the entire Chinese Elementary School. Currently, more than 300 people still live there, including more than 100 people who have fled back from Wonsan, Haeju, and Hamhung. The Chamber of Commerce issues two large pancakes to each person every day, each weighing approximately one catty, along with thin porridge. The food and lodging for the refugees are not a problem. On July 5, more than 130 overseas Chinese arrived by sea, unaware of the anti-Chinese movement in Incheon. The Chamber of Commerce persuaded them not to land and returned them on the original ship. On the 24th, another 136 people arrived from Yantai by boat. The Chamber of Commerce sent people on board to comfort them and advised them not to land unless they had important business. All 136 people said that they had to land to handle various post-disaster matters. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce took care of them and guided them to land. Sixty people stayed in Incheon, forty went to Gyeongseong, and the rest went to Hamhung and Wonsan. The Incheon Chamber of Commerce has provided relief to more than 10,000 overseas Chinese returning home. Among them, 2,000 people bought their own tickets, 4,000 people were transported for free, and 4,000 people were transported at half price. Recently, because there are still many overseas Chinese, the various ships have stated to the Chamber of Commerce that they have suffered too much loss from half-price and free transportation and will no longer undertake this kind of obligation. The Chamber of Commerce is still trying to persuade them.</p>
<h3>Shops in Incheon Destroyed</h3>
<p>Situation in Chinnampo and Sinuiju. Chinnampo and Incheon are both seaports, and the total number of overseas Chinese is uncertain. Although Sinuiju is not a seaport, because it is separated from Andong by a narrow river, overseas Chinese can come and go freely, and the number is difficult to count. Before the incident, there were approximately 7,000 people, most of whom were laborers, approximately 4,000, 2,000 vegetable farmers, and only 1,000 merchants. In Sinuiju, because the Japanese police were willing to help protect the shops, the losses were lighter. On July 16, they had fully resumed business. The business decline was less than before. Vegetable farmers and laborers are also gradually returning from Andong. Currently, the number of overseas Chinese in the area is approximately 4,000. However, the overseas Chinese in Zhongsi Island, where many Koreans live, are afraid that they will still be beaten after returning and no one dares to go there. The fields are also being destroyed by Koreans. Most of the overseas Chinese in the four villages of Chinnampo have returned home. Those who are unwilling to give up the fields they have worked so hard to cultivate sneak in to visit them during the day and return to the shelters in the consulate at night. Currently, there are 39 people living in the shelters. The Chamber of Commerce and the consulate prepare food and drink every day. Because they have no funds, they have requested assistance from the Gyeongseong Chamber of Commerce. The area was remitted 200 yuan to temporarily maintain the current situation.</p>
<h3>Two Overseas Chinese Brutally Murdered in Incheon</h3>
<p>Situation. Those returning home are also unable to pay for transportation, and Japanese ships are unwilling to transport them for free. Many are stranded locally. Small shops, such as taverns, are unable to recover and are still closed. Larger shops were forced to reopen on the 18th by the Japanese police, but there is no business. The shop assistants just sit and wait every day. In the evening, they fear that Koreans will still commit violence, so they close shop very early. In total, there are fewer than 1,000 overseas Chinese merchants, workers, and vegetable farmers, which is vastly different from the previous number. The Zhenhai warship of the First Fleet of the Northeast Navy was ordered to visit overseas Chinese in Korea. It arrived in Incheon on the 16th and docked outside the port. Captain Liu Guofu went ashore to visit the Chamber of Commerce and the shelters to comfort the overseas Chinese. They were very pleased to see our warship arrive. The ship docked until the morning of the 27th and then sailed to Chinnampo to comfort the overseas Chinese. (Dispatch from Incheon on the 26th)</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Remaining in Korea</p>
<h3>Determined to Return to the Country En Masse</h3>
<p>The Reasons for the Korean Exclusion of Chinese - The reasons for the Korean exclusion of Chinese this time are complex. According to sources from the resident consulate, there are two main reasons for the riots: (1) Affected by the economic downturn, many Japanese and Koreans are unemployed. Seeing the prosperity of our farmers and workers, they have repeatedly tried to expel them but have found no excuse. The Governor-General's Office intended to resist by not issuing labor permits, but still thought it was not thorough enough, so it used the Wanbaoshan case to secretly instruct newspapers to exaggerate the story in order to anger the Koreans and provoke a riot to achieve the purpose of expelling the Chinese. (2) The Koreans, in view of the anti-Chinese riots in 1927, saw that our country's negotiations yielded no results, so they regarded beating and killing Chinese as something to be feared. Moreover, because someone was secretly in charge, they acted more recklessly, shooting people everywhere.</p>
<p>Japanese Suspected of Masterminding - It is obvious that the Japanese were behind the scenes in this riot. Now, let's cite facts to prove it: (1) When the Koreans attacked, our overseas Chinese made legitimate self-defense and injured a Korean. The police station immediately demanded the surrender of the murderer and demanded medical and living expenses. However, the police station openly arrested and secretly released the murderer who beat our overseas Chinese to death, and the police station forbade the distribution of leaflets printed by various groups to persuade the Korean people. (2) Because of the Koreans' brutal acts, the overseas Chinese turned to the police station, begging to be temporarily taken in to avoid their attacks, but were often rejected, allowing the Koreans to abuse and kill them. As a result, some people died of starvation on the mountains or were forced to drown themselves, which was unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Plan to Return to the Country En Masse - The commercial foundations of the overseas Chinese in Korea have been completely destroyed by this tragedy. Countless people have returned to the country one after another. Those who are struggling to support themselves are also in a dangerous environment, business is sluggish, and people are in a state of panic all day long. The laborers have been virtually expelled and have lost their previous status. If the government's negotiations are ineffective, they are determined to return to the country en masse. They have already started contacting each other and are actively preparing. It is found that there are only 100,000 overseas Chinese in Korea, while there are millions of Japanese and Koreans living in our Northeast China, and their property is dozens of times that of our overseas Chinese. If our overseas Chinese return to the country, the Japanese will definitely have concerns. Therefore, I deeply hope that the government will take a tough stance in this negotiation and hope to get a satisfactory solution, otherwise, I am afraid that the situation will be even worse than today, and the overseas Chinese will have no room to stay in Korea.</p>
<h3>Graves of Overseas Chinese Who Died Tragically in Pyongyang</h3>
<p>A Korean Patriot</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Killing of Kim Yeon-pa</h3>
<p>Kim Was a Stalwart of the Pro-Japanese Party</p>
<p>And the Chief Culprit of Korean Anti-Chinese Sentiment</p>
<p>The Japanese Actually Held a Memorial Service</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence - The case of Kim Yeon-pa, alias Lee Sam, a resident reporter of the Man-Sun Daily, which is run by Japanese and Koreans, being killed in Jilin, has been completely distorted by Japanese and Korean newspapers. The truth obtained from the investigation is detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Kim Yeon-pa, alias Lee Sam, was from Hamgyong Province and was one of the stalwarts of the pro-Japanese party. In addition to being a resident reporter of the Man-Sun Daily in Seoul, he also served as a correspondent for Korean newspapers in Seoul, Incheon, and Pyongyang for several years. On weekdays, he was good at fabricating rumors and skillfully playing the flute about our Northeast military, political, and diplomatic affairs. Moreover, since this year, he has been accustomed to alienating the feelings between the Chinese and Korean people and inciting Korean hatred towards China. This kind of malicious propaganda has been exposed in various newspapers from time to time. Since the tense situation of the Wanbaoshan case in June and July, Kim Lee-sam has been taking the same steps as Japanese reporters to carry out malicious propaganda, resulting in the tragic incident of a riot of all Korean people killing and injuring overseas Chinese. The main points of his dispatches are as follows: (1) 400 to 500 Korean farmers in Ma Shaokou, Wanbaoshan, were surrounded by Chinese troops on June 29, their lives were uncertain, and 50 to 60 Koreans were arrested and sent to Jilin for punishment, and Chinese officials expelled all Korean farmers from Northeast China, etc. This is the first rumor he fabricated. (2) After the Korean farmers in Ma Shaokou were heavily surrounded by the Chinese army, they were almost completely shot and killed on July 1, and cannons were used to bombard the houses and kill countless people. The Japanese leader sent troops to rescue the victimized Korean overseas Chinese, etc. This is the rumor he fabricated and published in the Man-Sun newspapers, triggering the Korean anti-Chinese riots. Kim Lee-sam's fabricated dispatches were indeed the cause of it.</p>
<p>After the Wan-Sun cases occurred, the Northeast and Seoul Japanese and Korean newspapers continued to fuel the flames and continue the malicious propaganda to expand the scope of the unrest. The Korean overseas Chinese in Jilin twice telegraphed Kim Lee-sam to hold a meeting to discuss the truth of the Wan cases. Kim went to Jilin from Changchun on July 15 and stayed at the Far East Hotel in the business district to participate in the meeting. A group of Korean patriots questioned Kim why the Chinese army did not send troops in the Wan case, the Korean farmers were not surrounded, and they were not killed or arrested. Why did you (Kim) use yourself by the Japanese as a pro-Japanese dog to fabricate rumors about the Wan case and anti-Chinese riots in Seoul and other places? Kim was just expressing his apologies when he was shot to death by a man named Quan, and everyone dispersed in an uproar. After the Japanese leader Ishikawa learned of the incident, he sent police to rescue the crowd, and everyone fled. As a result, several Koreans who were not involved in the case were arrested. This is the reason for his murder. The facts about the counter-propaganda against the Wan case are that the newspapers reported that Kim was a reporter for the Dong-A Ilbo and the murderer was Park, which are all rumors and errors.</p>
<p>After Kim was shot and killed, the Japanese leader Tashiro specially sent Kim Dong-man, the president of the Changchun Korean Residents Association, to Jilin to transport the coffin back to Changchun. All transportation costs and coffin costs were paid by the Koreans in Toutaogou, with each household paying two yuan in Harbin dollars, which was collected by President Kim with the Japanese police. After Kim's coffin arrived in Changchun on the 18th, it was immediately buried. Subsequently, the Dongwen North Manchurian Daily, Industrial News, Asahi, and Dong-A branch offices, under the order of Consul Tashiro, together with Kim Dong-man, initiated the memorial service for the death of Kim Yeon-pa, a resident reporter of the Man-Sun Daily in Changchun. The organization has been established, and Japanese and Korean citizens must participate in the memorial service at 11:00 am on July 25 at the St. Prince Shotoku Hall to commend Kim Yeon-pa's pro-Japanese achievements and recognize him as one of the meritorious and outstanding people who sacrificed himself in the Wan case propaganda. All the memorial service expenses were paid by the resident Korean farmers, businessmen, and merchants according to their names, with each household paying two yuan in gold tickets. There was also a public notice informing that the Japanese leader Tashiro, Commander Bubo, and Nakagawa would all attend the memorial service, and the Japanese used Koreans to exclude Chinese, kill our overseas Chinese, and use news counter-propaganda to create the tragic incident of Korean hatred and killing of Chinese overseas Chinese, which can be further proved at this point.

<h3>Henan Province Post-Disaster Public Debt Regulations</h3>
<p>Passed by the Legislative Yuan Yesterday</p>

<p>Yuan's Submission - The Henan Provincial Government submitted a document to the Executive Yuan requesting permission to issue post-disaster public debt. The Executive Yuan immediately submitted it to the National Government for submission to the Legislative Yuan for review. The document stated that the Henan Provincial Government submitted a proposal stating that the provincial committee member and Finance Department Director Wan Wu proposed that the annual reduction in income of about 4 million yuan due to the implementation of the taxation system in Henan Province in January of this year, the reduction in the prepayment of land tax by 30% resulting in a reduction of more than 2.4 million yuan, and the exemption of the kerosene special tax resulting in a reduction of more than 2 million yuan, totaling a reduction of more than 8.4 million yuan in the provincial treasury throughout the year, resulting in a significant shortage of regular expenditures. Although the business tax is being implemented, there is no large amount of income in a short period of time. In addition, there are many aspects of post-disaster reconstruction and bandit suppression that need to be addressed. If we do not plan ahead, there will be a stagnation. During this transitional period, there is no good way to raise a large amount of money. It is proposed to follow the example of Hubei Province and raise 3 million yuan in post-disaster public debt to facilitate turnover. It is thought that Henan Province has experienced repeated issuances of public debt during the chaotic era of warlords, although the funds were designated, they were arbitrarily withdrawn, resulting in a loss of credibility and both the public and the people suffered. Now the office is registering and actively reorganizing the previous public debts. This time, the issuance of public debt should be corrected and repeated. It is proposed to use the business tax revenue as the fund for repayment of principal and interest, and submit it to the Fund Management Committee on a monthly basis for proper custody in order to consolidate the fund. All regulations and rules are currently being drafted by the office and submitted to your council for resolution, and please submit them to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance for review separately in order to show prudence. With this method, merchants will definitely subscribe enthusiastically. This public debt is specifically for substantial merchants to subscribe separately, and the procedures are simple and not complicated. The public will be able to maintain the difficulties, and the merchants will also be able to benefit slightly. Is this feasible? The regulations and brief introduction are hereby submitted for your decision, etc., which have been submitted to the 53rd meeting of the province and resolved, amended, and passed, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation, which is recorded in the file. It is found that Henan Province has a significant shortage of revenue and expenditure after the implementation of tax reduction and exemption, and the repayment of prepaid land tax. In addition, the simultaneous promotion of post-disaster reconstruction, bandit suppression, and relief efforts is particularly difficult, and stagnation is often feared. If it is not for the issuance of post-disaster public debt, it will not be enough to facilitate turnover and facilitate progress. In addition to informing the Finance Department, the regulations and brief introduction and attachments are hereby recorded and submitted for review and approval for implementation, etc., which have been sent to the Yuan for instructions to the Ministry of Finance for review and reply. The ministry's reply stated that Henan Province is issuing 3 million yuan in post-disaster public debt due to handling post-disaster affairs. The Commander-in-Chief approved the issuance of 2 million yuan in public debt, etc., which has been replied to by the ministry and requested to be forwarded for designation of the public debt guarantee fund and submitted the public debt regulations and other documents to the ministry for review. It is now found that the bond amount stipulated in the regulations sent is still 3 million yuan, which is not too much compared to the amount of revenue reduction in Henan Province. It is proposed to allow the issuance of the bond amount of 3 million yuan for funding.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The application for public debt principal and interest guarantee designated to be allocated from the business tax in Henan Province is still factual and should be approved and implemented together. The places where the public debt regulations and issuance charter should be amended are separately signed and annotated, and are hereby prepared and submitted to the National Government for submission to the Legislative Yuan for review, promulgation, and implementation, and to request instructions for compliance, etc. The amendments and revisions made by the ministry are still appropriate. In addition to instructions, the amended public debt regulations, issuance charter, and attachments are hereby drafted and submitted to the government for review and implementation. Respectfully submitted to the National Government.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Implements a Ban on Rice Export</h3>
<p>Wuhu Suffers from Flood and All the Fields are Submerged</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence - Wuhu has suffered from a major flood. Although the weather has been sunny for days, the floodwaters have not receded. The northern villages of Pujiadian, Baimawei, Yongzhengwei, and Wanbianwei collapsed again yesterday, submerging more than 70,000 mu of fields. The adjacent Dangtu Nine Weirs and Erbu also suffered accidents, submerging more than 100,000 mu of fields and killing one person. Wan Chunwei in Wu County is also in a critical situation. The county magistrate is supervising the rescue in the countryside day and night.</p>
<p>Due to the flood disaster, the rice-grabbing trend in the four villages is intensifying. Some bandits are using the name of disaster victims to grab rice, but in reality, they grab everything, even stripping clothes along the way with knives and guns. The county government has issued a notice advising the people to get on the right track, otherwise, even if they are disaster victims, they will be subject to the death penalty for grabbing rice. The provincial government recently issued an order to Wuhu to implement a ban on rice exports. The Public Security Bureau has dispatched patrol boats to the Siguang area to prevent and investigate.</p>
<h3>Flood Situation in Wuhu</h3>
<p>More than 40 counties in Anhui Province have been flooded. The provincial government's revenue mainly comes from land tax. Now that the weirs and fields have been submerged, there is no hope for grain and land tax at all. The estimated shortage of budget and government expenses is about 4 million yuan. The Finance Department has now suggested to the Ministry of Finance that it be allowed to collect donations to ban rice exports in order to maintain food for the people and increase tax revenue. Yesterday, a Hanping ship loaded with military rice for export was detained by the Public Security Bureau. It was only allowed to be released after it was proven that it had been purchased in advance and related to military food.</p>
<p>All industries in Wuhu have been suspended due to the major flood, and the market is extremely depressed. Therefore, shops and residents have initiated a suspension of rent payments. They have now jointly prepared and requested the government to maintain it. In addition, there have been four or five thousand refugees arriving in Wuhu for food in recent days. The military and police authorities are very busy maintaining and suppressing them. Yesterday, a refugee named Jia threw his eight-year-old son into the water and drowned him because he was fighting with his son for food. The viewers condemned him, and Jia also cried loudly.</p>
<p>The severity of the disaster in Anqing is no less than that in Wuhu. Two companies of troops were transferred from Wuhu the day before yesterday to maintain order among the disaster victims. However, there is still a shortage of food rice. Yesterday, representatives were specially dispatched by the Rice Industry Association to Wuhu to purchase 1,900 dan of rice to provide assistance. In addition to the passports issued by the provincial government, the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce was also telegraphed to assist. In the future, Anhui rice will also need a license from the provincial government to be allowed to pass through the province. (July 30)</p>

The meeting adjourned at 4:30 pm.</p>
<p>Attached are the relief methods for this year: (1) The association should submit a request to the provincial government to order the Department of Finance to return the approximately hundreds of thousands of yuan in relief funds that have been diverted from the accumulated 10-20% surcharges under the former Likin system in advance for use in handling urgent relief and work relief this year. If it is difficult to raise funds temporarily, at least a portion must be returned to maintain the famine policy. (2) The provincial budget for the 20th year of the Republic of China has a total of 400,000 yuan listed under the item of relief funds. It is proposed that the association submit a request to the provincial government to transfer the Department of Finance to raise funds as soon as possible to match the name and reality and attach importance to the famine policy. (3) The province previously had approximately 100,000 yuan in surplus funds from work relief in 15 counties including Huaiyin. It was originally planned to carry out work relief in the four counties of Fengpei, Xiaoxiao, and Dangshan, but it was later suspended. It is reported that the funds have now been allocated to the Department of Construction. If they have not yet been allocated, it is proposed that the funds be submitted to the provincial government to transfer them to the Department of Construction for use in carrying out work relief this year. (4) Telegraph the Central Disaster Relief Committee to request funds to handle urgent relief in the counties north of the Yangtze River. (5) In addition to temporary urgent relief, the relief methods for this year should focus on carrying out work relief in the disaster areas in order to enhance the effectiveness of relief.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Bandits Cannot Escape the Net of Justice - The bandit Tao Achang was previously arrested by the military police and sent to the Security Regiment camp stationed in Jinshanwei. The bandit's confession was cunning and was secretly released. The outside world was quite surprised. The matter was heard by Commander Cao, who ordered Battalion Commander Fang to order the original guarantor to hand over the bandit for review. It is now reported that the bandit was spotted in the Dongmen area of Jinshanwei and was arrested by the camp on July 29. He will be sent to Songjiang within the day.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Shen Instructed to Issue Quarry Workers' Wages - The scenic spot of Jiufeng in Songjiang County has been destroyed by the sale of mountain stones by local ruffians. The local people have repeatedly opposed it and have invited the superiors to review and order the cessation of mining. Now it is learned that County Magistrate Shen instructed the Cao Yunji Stone Mill in Tianmashan in a document stating that it is for the purpose of instructing matters. According to the report of Zhu Wen, the acting chief of the eighth district, it is said that the foreman Hu Zhilian of the Cao Yunji Stone Mill in Tianmashan reported that the stone mill owes wages and the workers cannot live and urgently requested the county government to strictly order the stone mill to issue the wages in full, etc. (Attached copy of the original report) It is secretly investigated that the workers and the factory have labor and wages as mutual conditions, but the stone mill enjoys the benefits and cannot fulfill its obligations, accumulating wages and failing to issue them, causing the workers to be unable to maintain their lives. In case the workers are forced by life to riot, the disaster is not something that can be imagined. Moreover, the stone mill has been ordered to stop mining. Once the workers are unemployed and wander in other places, it is difficult to predict that they will not take excessive actions. Moreover, theft and robbery have occurred frequently recently. The reason for this is nothing more than being forced by life. Recently, a local guard in Chenshan District, the neighboring district, was stolen, robbed, killed, and looted, which is frightening to hear. The officials repeatedly thought that there was only a clear Chen Jun review and quickly issued a strict order to the stone mill to quickly issue all the wages that should be issued and dismiss the workers back to their original places of origin. On the one hand, the stone mill was provisionally attached with the stones, utensils, and ships stored in the factory in order to enforce the execution in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers and the safety of the place, etc. According to this, in addition to the instructions, the stone mill is hereby instructed to comply and quickly issue the wages owed to the workers in full. If there is any intention to delay, the stone mill shall be fully responsible for any disturbances that may occur in the future. Do not delay yourself. This instruction.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Adultery and Abduction Case Scheduled for Trial - Zhang, a farmer from the 22nd Tu of Zhangweng Temple Township in the first district, was abducted by Zhou Siwu, a Yangzhou barber who worked in Nanqiao, last year. Recently, it was suddenly discovered that the wife was living with the adulterer in Shen Xiang's house in Qingcun Port. The police were immediately dispatched from the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau to arrest and interrogate him. Except for Zhou, who had escaped two days ago after hearing the interrogation and has not been found yet, Zhang insisted that she had gone out to work as a helper and had not had an affair with Zhou. Then, the branch director ordered the husband to take her back and restrain her in court. Unexpectedly, Zhang's wife suddenly appealed to the county government yesterday, admitting that she had committed adultery with Zhou Siwu, and that the transaction was handled by a Chen, etc. Therefore, County Magistrate Shen, in addition to summoning Shen Xiang and other related persons to the case today for evidence, also scheduled a court hearing on the 5th for investigation.</p>
<p>Jiangduan, Minpu, South of Fujian, Urges Completion by Telegram - County Surveillance Committee Lin Bocui, etc., specifically telegraphed the provincial government yesterday regarding the construction of Minpu Road in the south of the county, saying that the 2,200-odd meters of Jiangduan, which belongs to the southern part of Fujian Road, belongs to the territory of Nanhui County. Although the hall has repeatedly ordered the construction, the county has delayed it and has not complied, resulting in obstacles to the full traffic on the road. I do not know that the road is not only an important passage for the two counties to Shanghai, but also has many relations in defense. Nanhui agreed to build at the same time. In the beginning, we should have worked together in the future. Now, after two years of operation, it has been destroyed by the county. Is it only the enthusiasm of the people of the county who have worked hard to build roads? I am afraid that the future of national construction will also be affected. The committees have witnessed the heartbreak and tears. We are suffering from the pain of skinning. We are appealing to the court to ask the Nanhui authorities to complete the construction in the shortest possible time. Otherwise, it will take more time and the loss will be greater. The county only has to act on its behalf to start work and rebuild the road.</p>
<p>Sea Water Surges and Digs Holes for Disaster Relief - The county government is currently reporting that Wang Boqian, the chief of the third district, telegraphed that the continuous heavy rain and sea water surge have turned all the towns outside the old Qin Gongtang into a swamp. The farmland has been flooded and the houses have been washed away. Although the sky has gradually cleared, the water inside the new pond is still three feet deep, and the situation is critical. County Magistrate Shen specifically rushed to inspect it yesterday (29th) in conjunction with Zhou Jiuxu, the director of the Construction Bureau, and convened the affected people to discuss the aftermath. It was decided to first rush to dig culverts along the important land of the pond within three days to release water to save the endangered. The expenses will be temporarily donated and advanced by the owners of various industries.</p>
<h3>Chuansha</h3>
<p>The New County Magistrate Took Over - The newly appointed acting County Magistrate of Chuansha County, Li Leng, arrived in the county at 11:00 am on the 1st to take over. The former secretary, Hu Yirong, handed over the seals, files, etc. one by one according to the register, and immediately announced that Wang Pei would be the secretary and Fang Hongxiao would be the section chief.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>The Dismissal of the Seventh District Head on Charges: He Guozhao, the former head of the Seventh District of Kunshan County, was sued by local residents, including Li Zhihui, to the Department of Civil Affairs. After an investigation by the county government, a report was submitted. The Department of Civil Affairs then issued an order for Head He's immediate dismissal. County Magistrate Pang, upon receiving the order, appointed Zhang Yilun, an autonomous guidance officer, to act as his replacement.</p>
<p>Execution by Firing Squad for Kidnappers: Luo Qixiang, the former head of the county police, apprehended Xiao Qingguo, Ji Rucai, Meng Qingyu, and Chen Chunzhang in Wuxi. These bandits were responsible for robbing the Chun Shen He Rong No. 2 small steamer and kidnapping the son of Gu Shixi, demanding a large ransom. After multiple interrogations in the county, they all confessed to their crimes. The county sentenced them to death, and the provincial authorities approved the sentence. At 9:00 AM one day, County Magistrate Pang ascended to the criminal court, signed the order to bring forth the four convicts, verified their identities, and had them bound and taken to the foot of Ma'anshan Mountain for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suggestions to Promote the Establishment of a Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation: The County Chamber of Commerce held an executive committee meeting yesterday (the 1st), chaired by Shi Junqing. The resolutions passed were as follows: (1) Adoption of the organizational charter for branch offices in various districts and towns; (2) Adoption of regulations for official correspondence of various trade guilds, effective from September 1st; (3) Suggesting that the provincial representatives' assembly urge and guide the establishment of a provincial chamber of commerce federation; (4) Due to the continuous rain in the county, which has damaged farmland, a request to the Provincial Government Construction Department to suspend road construction projects in the county for one year and to transfer all road construction funds to work-for-relief programs to urgently build low-lying field embankments in order to provide relief.</p>
<p>Female Bandit Sun Chen Met Her Demise: Sun Chen, a female bandit from Wujiang, harbored bandits and stolen goods from Tonghu bandits in her home and repeatedly committed kidnapping and robbery. The Third District of the Zhejiang Water Police captured the female bandit and sent her to the Jiang-Zhe Joint Provinces Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters for interrogation. After confirming her guilt, she was sentenced to death and the provincial government approved the sentence. Yesterday (the 1st) at 5:00 PM, the headquarters had her bound and taken to Wangshudun execution grounds for execution by firing squad. The female convict remained unrepentant until her death, showing a disregard for the law.</p>
<p>Request to Reduce the Width of City Streets: The Committee for the Study of City Street Width held a meeting yesterday. The consensus was that the city street width, as previously decided by the administrative meeting, should not exceed ten meters. The current changes to the dimensions are not actually needed by the county. Pan Ziqi, Wang Jiacang, and Shen Yizhi were immediately appointed to meet with the county magistrate and the director of the Construction Bureau to present their case in person. Meanwhile, local figures, led by Pan Jingbao, will submit a request to reduce the width.</p>
<p>The New County Magistrate Will Arrive in Suzhou Tomorrow to Take Over: Huang Yunzhen, the County Magistrate of Wuxian County, has been approved to resign. Wu Jia was appointed to fill the vacancy. Wu is the current County Magistrate of Wujiang County. Because he has not yet handed over his duties, he has not yet arrived in Suzhou to take office. After Huang County Magistrate urged him, the new County Magistrate Wu telegraphed Huang County Magistrate and decided to arrive in Suzhou tomorrow (the 3rd) and take over around the 4th or 5th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Death of a Silk Shop Apprentice is Unclear: Zhang Wanzheng (aka Jinlong), a 19-year-old apprentice at the Yong Sheng Silk and Satin Company on Tongyun Road outside Guangfu Gate in this city, was from Tangnan Township, Mazhen, Jiangyin. Zhang had long suffered from beriberi, which caused him great inconvenience, but his spirits were still good. On the morning of the 29th of last month, he suddenly felt dizzy, but recovered in an instant. At lunch, he ate three bowls of rice and showed no unusual signs. However, in the evening, he felt even more unwell and went to his dormitory on the third floor to sleep. He groaned incessantly in the middle of the night and finally died at 7:00 AM the next morning. Subsequently, the staff of the company reported to the manager, Xue Gusun, who sent the shop staff to invite Dr. Zhu Pinsan from the Brothers Hospital to examine the body. After examining the body, Dr. Zhu found the patient cold all over and already dead, so he left. The company's manager, Xue Gusun, was deeply afraid that the deceased's family would come to question him and went to the clinic of Deng Xingbo, a Chinese medicine doctor in Nanmen, at 9:00 AM to register a blank registration number in order to prepare for embellishing the situation. At the same time, he hired workers to move Zhang Wanzheng's body to an empty room behind the Guang Silk and Cloth Industry Association south of Chang'an Bridge. On the 31st, the deceased's mother, Kong, and brother, Jinqing, received the news and came to Wuxi and had a major dispute with the company. Two blue spots were found below the deceased's lower abdomen, and one red spot was found between the seas of blood. The family of the deceased felt that Zhang Wanzheng's death was quite strange, so they went to the county court with Wu Jiahe, the head of the fourth block, to request an autopsy. Upon receiving the report, the prosecutor's office sent Prosecutor Du, forensic examiner Shen, and court police officers in a streetcar to the scene yesterday (the 1st) at 3:00 PM. After arriving at the Silk and Cloth Industry Association, Du questioned the family one by one. At 4:30 PM, he ordered forensic examiner Shen to perform an autopsy according to the law. The autopsy revealed that the deceased, Zhang Wanzheng, had blue-purple spots all over his body and no injuries. Prosecutor Du then ordered forensic examiner Shen to call Dr. Zhu Pinsan from the Brothers Hospital to the scene to determine what disease it was and whether it was sha. Dr. Zhu was unable to determine the cause of the blue-purple spots. After two hours of examination, no injuries were found, so Zhang Wanzheng's death was quite strange.</p>
<p>The Appeal of the Local Dyeing and Weaving Industry Against Goods: The Wuxi Cloth Factory Trade Association believes that at a time when the whole country is uniformly resisting goods, but the anti-Japanese target is to actively increase production by promoting national goods, the Anti-Japanese Association last year arbitrarily withdrew the fine yarn shares to collect national salvation funds to establish its own fine yarn factory, which resulted in huge financial losses to various dyeing and weaving factories. This year, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Committee decided to set a time limit for the various industry associations to raise funds to establish factories to imitate production. The intention is not bad, but the capital of the various dyeing and weaving factories is limited, and it is practically impossible to establish a fine yarn factory within the prescribed time limit. It is better to order the existing yarn factories in the country to increase the number of fine yarn spindles to spin fine yarn, which is easy to do. The output will increase and the supply and demand will be able to correspond to each other, and the effect will be more significant. Furthermore, the yarn factories in the country raise prices during anti-Japanese movements, which increases the cost of national networks and makes it impossible to compete with foreign goods. Even now, at the beginning of the resistance to goods, the market price on July 16th was 355 taels per piece of Blue Phoenix Japanese yarn, 352 taels per piece of Human Clock Japanese yarn, and 355 taels per piece of Jincheng yarn. By July 28th, the price of Blue Phoenix Japanese yarn had risen by 10 taels per piece, while Human Clock had risen to 384 taels and Jincheng to 398 taels. In total, Japanese yarn had risen by 32 to 43 taels per piece, obviously taking advantage of the opportunity to arbitrarily seek profit, which in fact increases the cost of national goods, which is no different from destroying them. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce to forward to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to find ways to pay attention to it in order to benefit national goods and prevent monopoly.</p>
<p>The Returned Cloth Seized from Lixin: The Zhabei Inspection Station of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Committee previously seized 15 boxes of cloth, a total of 636 pieces, transported to Shanghai by Wuxi Lixin Dyeing and Weaving Company, suspecting that they were Japanese goods. The company sent a letter to the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to prove that they were indeed domestic goods, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also stated that Lixin cloth was indeed a good domestic product that had long been popular in various places and had been repeatedly certified and rewarded by the Ministry of Industry. It immediately sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association, which resolved at a general meeting to return all of them on the 31st and sent a letter to the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce to inform them.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang</h3>
<p>Wang Jiwu is Accused Again: The former county magistrate Wang Jiwu was accused by Liu Zhenzhi and others of the New Port land case. The High Court issued the case to the Zhenjiang Local Court for investigation. The former trial judges Liang Wei and Yao Zhusan surrendered themselves and were released on bail pending trial. Now, Chen Yaoqun accused Wang Jiwu of embezzling the fines from the tobacco case and framing Zhu Ji on suspicion. The Zhenjiang Local Court also handled the case. The court session was on the 28th, but only Chen Yaoqun appeared in court. It was ordered to check the case files of the Jingjiang County tobacco case to Zhenjiang and summon Wang Jiwu to court again for further investigation.</p>
<p>National and Provincial Representatives Elected Simultaneously: The county party headquarters held elections for national and provincial representatives on the 28th. As a result, Qian Juntang and Tao Zhenqiu were elected as national representatives, and Huang Renhua, Liu Chaoyuan, and Sheng Xiru were elected as provincial representatives.</p>
<p>Guangshengzhuang Robbed: More than ten bandits suddenly came to Guangshengzhuang in the eighth district on the night of the 25th, broke down the door and carried out robbery, losing 50 yuan in silver dollars and clothing worth more than 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Provincial Rural Clearing Bureau Completely Shut Down: The Jiangsu Provincial Rural Clearing Bureau was originally scheduled to shut down at the end of June. However, due to the fact that many procedures could not be completed in time, it was approved to extend the deadline by one month to the end of July. Yesterday was the deadline, so all matters were closed out, and all the handled cases and subsequent unfinished procedures were transferred to the Department of Civil Affairs with the approval of the provincial government for continued processing.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Recover Slightly Due to the Weather: The rice market in this port rose sharply by about one yuan per shih due to the rain in the past.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The First Day of the National Vocational Education Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held in Zhenjiang yesterday. The first general meeting was held, followed by group meetings. The standard of vocational education facilities was discussed.</p>
<h3>(1) Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>The National Vocational Education Discussion Meeting convened by the China Vocational Education Society was held at 9:00 AM yesterday in Boxian Park, Zhenjiang. Attendees included Gu Shusen, a representative of the Ministry of Education, Jin Tigan, a representative of Provincial Government Chairman Ye Chucang, Hu Pu'an from the Provincial Party Committee, as well as guests from various institutions and over two hundred members representing ten major provinces and three cities. The presidium consisted of Cai Zimin, Zhun Lengyuqiu, Hu Shihua, Jiang Wenyu, and Gu Shusen. The meeting commenced at 9:30 AM, with formalities observed as usual.</p>
<p>Chairman Cai Yuanpei delivered the opening address: He briefly stated that vocational education has ancient origins and has been practiced in various European and American countries for a long time. University and specialized education are especially related to vocational education. This is the most important issue for saving the people's livelihood and developing resources. Now, representatives from various provinces and regions are gathered to discuss the most important events in vocational education, which is truly the most valuable thing. The turning point for education in China in the future lies in this. He deeply hoped that everyone would exchange their views, proceed practically, and strive for results.</p>
<p>Jiang Wenyu reported: He said that the actual number of members attending the meeting was 184, including vocational schools, vocational guidance, and rural institutions. The scope is wider than previous conferences. Next, a representative of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Gu Shusen delivered a speech: He briefly stated that the recent trend in education has been to promote production education due to the increasing hardship of people's livelihoods and the decreasing production. The Ministry of Education has recently devoted its full efforts to labor and production operations. On the one hand, it has issued a notice to all provinces and cities to promote vocational education, and on the other hand, it has submitted it to the National Conference for the passage of productive vocational education. Therefore, various places have proceeded one after another, and the atmosphere is very good. However, the implementation of vocational education is not easy. If it is done in the future, it will only be superficial, and students will still have no way out. How can this be dealt with? This is extremely dangerous, so serious attention must be paid to the following three points: (1) Promote the spirit of students being able to create automatically and open up new paths; (2) Promote students to pay attention to rural life and the development of agriculture, so that most of us do not tend to urban areas, and agricultural production has hope for development; (3) Promote cooperative undertakings so that young people can give full play to their abilities after graduation and engage in various beneficial productive cooperative undertakings, not afraid of small businesses, not afraid of physical and mental hardship, and always aim at not eating ready-made food and developing local resources. Such as border colonization, farming, field animal husbandry, and various sideline occupations, are all new paths for young people. If vocational education can be done in this way, the effectiveness of vocational education will be great. Next, Hu Pu'an, member of the Provincial Party Committee and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs,</p>
<p>Hu Pu'an delivered a speech: He briefly stated that the most difficult problem in education recently is the problem of students' future. Primary school students may not all be able to enter middle schools after graduation, and middle school students may not all be able to enter universities. Therefore, these students who do not go to school will inevitably want to seek a career, but they have not received vocational training on weekdays and have no expertise. How can they engage in a career with any skills? Even if they勉强 get a job, how can it be suitable for social application? In addition, social seduction and the fascination of vanity make everyone aim at serving in the political world. Therefore, the education they receive does not focus on real talent and practical learning. As a result, there are fewer and fewer specialized talents and too many ordinary talents. Even teachers who have learned specialized skills do not want to be teachers, and engineers do not want to be engineers. Therefore, there are fewer and fewer talents in the education and engineering fields. Therefore, in the future, education must cultivate useful talents for the business community from professional training. This vocational education is the most needed education today. It is not easy to succeed without the national efforts to carry it out. Especially the basic agricultural application education methods of a country promote its progress and arouse the attention of young people all over the country to seek real talent and practical learning as a work to save the country, so that students' knowledge and skills can be seen thoroughly and skillfully. Not only should they seek knowledge in books, but they must also seek experience in practical work, break the concept of being promoted to official positions and making a fortune, and devote their academic, industrial, and agricultural achievements to society. This is the greatest task of vocational education. With the enthusiasm that you have always worked hard in vocational education, you will surely put a special light on China's livelihood problems. Next, Ye Chairman's representative, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government,</p>
<p>Jin Tigan delivered a speech: He briefly stated that vocational education is the best education to save the country. Our Jiangsu education has never been behind, but we still need to work hard in vocational education to save the declining livelihood of the people and develop local resources.</p>
<p>Member speeches: Members who gave speeches included (1) Liu Yunchou, President of the National Central Agricultural College, (2) Gong Zengwei, female principal of the Hubei Provincial No. 1 Women's Vocational School, (3) Tie Ming, representative of the Shanghai Aiqun Women's School, (4) Huang Boyi, Director of the Construction Bureau of Baxian, Sichuan, (5) Han Yulin, representative of the Liaoning Education Department, (6) Peng Chuanzhen, representative of the Fujian Education Department, (7) Gu Jiao Ruo, representative of Changshu, (8) He Yuanqi, representative of Taicang, etc.</p>
<p>Leng Yuqiu's Reply: The enthusiastic attendance of this grand event and the sincere contributions of the members are not only the glory of our town, but also the luck of our Jiangsu. I hope you will work harder.</p>
<p>Photograph After the ceremony, a group photo was taken in front of the statue of the martyr at 12 o'clock to commemorate the event.</p>
<h3>(2) First General Assembly</h3>
<p>The first general meeting was held at 1:00 PM. Chairpersons Cai Yuanpei, Gu Shusen, Leng Yu, Hu Yushu, and Zhang Yiqing performed the ceremony as usual. First, Cai Zimin delivered the opening address, Jiang Wenyu reported on the situation of the resolutions of the previous session, and then began to put forward proposals. In addition to the vocational guidance discussion meeting, it was divided into four groups: (1) Vocational Education Administration, (2) Vocational Education Curriculum, (3) Agricultural and Industrial Education, (4) Women's Vocational Education. Jiang Wenyu explained the situation of each proposal, a total of 49 proposals, which were all assigned to each group to start reviewing. Then, Mr. Jiang put forward the proposal for the standard of vocational education facilities. First, Gu Shusen, Director of the Department of Ordinary Education of the Ministry of Education, explained the status of each academic system in great detail. Feng Limin advocated adding a Department of Fisheries Education. The attending members all believed that fisheries education should be highly valued, but it has always been included in the scope of agricultural education, so it does not seem necessary to establish it separately. Most people agreed that when discussing the mode of education facilities, most people advocated adding vocational guidance in schools under the vocational guidance center. Most people advocated maintaining the original plan. Then, the standards for vocational school facilities, the standards for the distribution of vocational school subjects, the standards for vocational school moral education, the methods for vocational subject practice, the standards for vocational education facilities, and the standards for the establishment of vocational guidance centers were all approved separately. Chairmen Cai Zimin and Gu Shusen sat upright on the rostrum for four or five hours without rest. Mr. Jiang Wenyu was even busier dealing with and mediating, and the secretary Qi Lunti was even more laborious running around directing.</p>

<h3>Educational Products Exhibition at the National Games</h3>
<p>Preparation Plan Finalized</p>
<p>Special Envoy Yang Duo Arrives in Shanghai to Coordinate</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's National Games in the capital is currently under active preparation. The Ministry of Industry plans to hold an educational products exhibition within the Games to embellish it and promote culture. The Preparatory Committee has specially sent Yang, the director of the National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry, to Shanghai to liaise with various bookstores. Yesterday, reporters from the Industrial and Commercial Society visited Director Yang at his residence and inquired about the progress. Director Yang said that this conference is an unprecedented initiative, and the educational products exhibition is even more important than previous exhibitions. Currently, the Shanghai Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, World Book Company, and Shi Xue Tong Yi Guan and other bookstores have enthusiastically joined. However, the exhibition of educational products is not easy to attract attention. The exhibition will not enable the general public to understand. To achieve the effect of publicity, it is bound to be twice the effort and half the result. Therefore, a preparation plan has been formulated, actively investigating domestic educational product manufacturers and the names of schools across the country to facilitate the creation of a register for investigation. Special attention should be paid to products from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Tianjin, Jinan, and Liaoning provinces. The types of items to be collected are divided into (A) Stationery: pens, ink, paper, inkstones, paints, inkpads, glue, paste, sealing wax, chalk, pen holders, pen rests, book clips, ink clips, ink boxes, brush washers, ink boxes, paperweights, cardboard, wax paper, original paper, blueprint paper, stationery, envelopes, photo card stock, etc.; (B) Scientific equipment: geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, medicine, physiology, meteorology, and other instruments, specimens, models, and illustrations; (C) Sports equipment: balls, rackets, nets, discus, javelins, clubs, bats, dumbbells, and sportswear, running shoes, etc.; (D) Printed materials and printing equipment: books, charts, and woodblocks, lithographs, copperplates, steel plates, movable type, mimeograph stencils, carbon paper, lead type, copper molds, binding machines, typewriters, etc.; (E) Musical instruments and toys: organs, drums, horns, stringed instruments, and children's toys, films, slides, records, etc.; (F) Special educational supplies: Mongolian and Tibetan education, deaf-mute education, and other supplies, totaling more than a thousand items. As the Double Tenth Festival is approaching soon, the collection of these items must be expedited. In the meantime, various bookstores should be urged to go to Beijing around the 10th of this month to arrange the displays as soon as possible. Regarding the displays, they will be divided into general and special sections for decoration and layout, striving for beauty. Director Yang is currently residing at the YMCA on Sichuan Road and will be returning to Beijing soon.</p>
<p>Academics</p>
<h3>Organizations May Not Directly Submit Filings to the Ministry</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a submission from the Executive Committee of the China Geographical Society, noted that European and American countries place great emphasis on geography. In addition to geography departments in schools, most major cities also have geographical societies (organizations exist in Japan, England, France, America). Looking back at our country, besides the China Geographical Society in Beiping, there are few others. Shanghai, as a hub of Chinese and foreign culture, has people who recognize this and have organized this association. According to the association's charter, they are actively preparing for the publication of the "Journal of Geography" and the "Geography Series," as well as inviting geography experts to give lectures. The establishment of an academic organization should be submitted for registration, etc. The Ministry of Education responded that academic organizations may not directly submit registration requests to the Ministry. They must follow the Organizational Guidelines for Cultural Organizations, first apply for permission from the local senior party headquarters, and then apply to the relevant government agency for registration. They should be informed accordingly.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai French Concession Mixed Court was abolished on a Ministry order the day before yesterday, the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, two new courts, were formally established yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. At the same time, the two court presidents and former staff of the French Mixed Court began to inventory various documents. The French side sent representatives, such as Duguergar, to hand over everything clearly to show solemnity. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment of Two Courts: The Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court both raised the flag of the Party and the nation at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning. At about 10:00 AM, Liang Renjie, the president of the High Branch, Peng Wangye, the chief prosecutor, Ying Shi, the president of the Local Court, and Chen Beisan, the chief prosecutor, arrived successively. They then issued announcements, inaugurated the seals of office, and declared the establishment of the courts. At the same time, the organizations of the four departments of the two courts, namely the Documents and Records (divided into civil and criminal courts), Accounting (including General Affairs), Statistics, and the two divisions of Confiscated Goods and Execution, have not yet been completed and will be fully prepared in a day or two. It is heard that civil and criminal urgent cases will be accepted starting tomorrow, and regular cases will be handled starting on the 6th.</p>
<p>Announcement of the High Court: Announcement regarding the appointment of Liang Renjie as the acting president of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and Peng Wangye as the acting chief prosecutor of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, as ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration on the 29th of this month. Upon receiving this order, Renjie and Wangye immediately rushed to their posts to prepare together. In addition to the existing court site, they found the houses at No. 6, No. 7, No. 9, No. 10, No. 11, and No. 12 Heng'ai Lane, West Egham Road, French Concession, as the court's office location. The court was formally established on the 1st of this month, in accordance with the time limit. They first arrived at the court to handle affairs and will choose a date to hold the swearing-in ceremony as required. Moreover, on the 30th of last month, they received two copper square seals from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, one of which reads "Seal of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court," and the other reads "Seal of the Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court," which have been respectfully inaugurated today. However, since this is the beginning of the handover, the affairs are very busy. Except for urgent cases, which will be handled at any time, other ordinary litigation matters will be accepted starting on the 6th of this month. In addition to reporting and distributing, this announcement is specially made.</p>

Upon receiving this order, Ying Shi and Beisan immediately rushed to their posts to prepare together. In addition to the existing court site, they found the Hemei Fang on Xuehuali Road, French Concession, as the court's office location. The court was formally established on the 1st of this month, in accordance with the time limit. They first arrived at the court to handle affairs and will choose a date to hold the swearing-in ceremony, and they received two copper square seals from the Ministry of Judicial Administration via the order of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, which read, (1) Seal of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, (2) Seal of the Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, which have been respectfully inaugurated today.

In addition to reporting and distributing, this announcement is specially made.</p>
<p>Announcement of the Prison: Announcement regarding the appointment of Xie Fuzi as the acting warden of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court Prison, as ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The warden took office on August 1st, after a separate oath and reporting and notice to all concerned.</p>
<p>Inventory Situation: At 10:00 AM yesterday, Xiao Jinfang and Tang Zaili led the entire receiving staff to begin inventory, classifying and receiving files, registers, books, houses, funds, equipment, archives, confiscated goods, and other items. For equipment that was not suitable for our use, such as door plaques, the French side sent people to transport them away. By about 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the general reception was completed. Regarding the documents, if there were any unclear points, the French representative Duguergar could be consulted at any time.</p>
<p>Important Items: Among the various documents received yesterday, apart from civil and criminal documents for which there were no relevant statistics, the important documents, deeds, and mortgage certificates that were personally received by Liang Renjie and Ying Shi, the two court presidents, and Xiao Jinfang from the French representative Duguergar included one paper each for land deeds, two papers for mortgages, one seal, one car, one house insurance policy, and one car license insurance policy. The funds included deposit slips for 4,196 taels in the bank and 1,361.04 yuan in cash. All of the above were jointly signed by the court president and the French representative Duguergar, and a copy of the signed document was kept by each party to show solemnity. In addition, there were confiscated goods, including more than 130 catties of opium and smoking paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Court Establishment Meeting: At 11:00 AM yesterday, Liang and Ying, the two court presidents, convened all the receiving staff to hold a simple ceremony for the establishment meeting. The two court presidents and the chief prosecutor delivered instructions, and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Liang's Instructions: Today, the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Jiangsu Second Special District Local Court are established. I am very pleased. Regarding the future progress, we will work together with the staff of the court with the determination to pool our wisdom and efforts to prepare for the recovery of French rights.</p>
<p>President Ying's Instructions: The takeover of the French Mixed Court that the citizens of the city hoped for has been realized today. The various difficulties in the takeover negotiations have been overcome, and victory has been achieved. We must all pay attention to the responsibilities in the future. Everyone, from the top to the bottom, should strive to be loyal to their duties. If one person does not work hard, it will be enough to make the court unpopular. For example, if a screw is damaged on a machine, it cannot be moved. The personnel in the agency are also like this. I encourage my colleagues.</p>
<p>Prosecutor's Instructions: Chief Prosecutor Peng said that prosecution and justice are originally a single entity. When handling prosecution, we must know the importance of responsibility. Prosecutors should use a fair spirit and clear eyes to seek happiness for the people in judging the judgments of judges.</p>
<p>Congratulations from the Citizens' Association: To Liang, the president of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in the Shanghai French Concession, Ying, the president of the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, and the judges of the two courts: The establishment of your courts is celebrated by the citizens. The citizens residing in the French Concession have escaped from the depths of suffering and have seen the light of day. Their joy is indescribable. I sincerely hope that your presidents and judges will act with impartiality and selflessness to protect the peace of the citizens, to promote the spirit of the rule of law, and to quickly cleanse the degenerate customs of smoking, gambling, and prostitution in the French Concession, so that the poisonous dragons can be removed and the customs can be improved, and to strive for the goal of freedom and equality in the future. Deeply moved by the congratulations, the association is more aware of its responsibilities. It is respectfully communicated with respect. United Association of Citizens of the Shanghai Special District.</p>
<h3>August 1st Passed Peacefully</h3>
<p>Strict Prevention by the Chinese Concession Authorities</p>
<p>Yesterday was the so-called "August 1st" Red Commemoration Day. The Chinese Concession authorities in this city specially added guards to the key points and thoroughfares, and the defense was very strict, so it has passed peacefully. The defense situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Nanshi: Yesterday, from 7:00 AM, the Public Security Bureau temporarily dispatched box gun teams of three to five people to guard the key sections of Nanshi, including the Old West Gate, Gaochang Temple, South Railway Station, and Xiaodongmen. Double guards were also stationed at the New North Gate, Fangbang Bridge, and tram stations. However, only those with suspicious appearances or carrying packages were slightly checked, and vehicles passing by were not checked one by one.</p>
<p>Zhabei: In Zhabei, there are many factories. Yesterday was also Saturday, so the fourth and sixth districts received orders in advance to strengthen their defenses all day. Patrol teams were formed at the Datong Road Sun Temple to patrol back and forth. On Baoshan Road, because the North Railway Station is located in a transportation hub, there were even more police officers stationed there than elsewhere. Starting yesterday, soldiers were maintaining security in the station, and the soldiers were responsible for checking passengers getting on and off.</p>
<p>Concessions: Although the Public Concession and the French Concession also had the same defense, in the Public Concession's Nanjing Road, such as Risen Building, Shilu, and New World, Western constables and two Chinese constables were stationed together. In addition to increasing the number of patrol constables to inspect, there were also Indian cavalry patrols on Jing'an Temple Road and Aidaoya Road. The French Concession police authorities paid special attention to the secluded intersections, and the iron gates were mostly closed. At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a large number of reactionaries were discovered in the Caishi Road and Bai'er Road area, setting off firecrackers when people were unprepared, and at the same time distributing various reactionary leaflets. When the police station heard the news, they immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to arrest them, but the group had already disappeared. The leaflets that were sent out were collected and sent to the police station for further investigation, and the evening was as peaceful as usual.</p>
<h3>Chiang Tso-pin's Remarks</h3>
<p>Will Head North to Europe in About a Week</p>
<p>Wang Chia-chen Awaits in Harbin to Travel Together</p>
<p>A Second European War Will Not Occur</p>
<p>Envoy to Germany, Mr. Chiang Tso-pin, who was recently summoned to Kiangsi by Chairman Chiang, returned to Shanghai the night before last. Our reporter made a special visit to his residence yesterday afternoon. According to Mr. Chiang, "On the 25th, I returned from Nanchang to Kiukiang, and everything I saw along the way was a waterlogged country. The Nanxun Road was interrupted several times, but fortunately, it was quickly repaired. Chairman Chiang is personally leading his soldiers to suppress the communist bandits in this humid summer heat. His spirit is admirable, and his selfless dedication to the party and the country is respectable. Now, the Kiangsi bandits are becoming increasingly cornered and can be completely eliminated in the shortest possible time. I will stay in Shanghai for about a week, then take a ship with my wife to Dalian and transfer to Harbin. Vice Minister Wang Chia-chen has already left Shanghai for the north on the 30th. It has been agreed that Mr. Wang will wait for us in Harbin, and then we will travel together to Europe via Siberia to attend the League of Nations General Assembly opening on September 7th. At this session, our country has a good chance of being elected as a non-permanent member of the council, but internal disputes have not yet ended, so we have no certainty externally." Mr. Chiang also said, "At this critical time of tense Sino-Japanese negotiations, the country should first unite. If there is duplicity externally, flattering foreigners at the opportunity, then shame and integrity will be lost, and the country will have no days left," and so on. The reporter asked about the prophecies that Europe would have another major war next year, with France and Italy as the trigger. What were his observations? Mr. Chiang replied, "The people of Europe suffered greatly from the previous war, and they cannot forget it in a short period of time. Therefore, in fact, there will be no actions that disrupt peace in the next three to five years. As for what the myths say, I dare not know." He also said that the League of Nations conference would last for about three weeks, and his wife would return to the country first after the Geneva conference ended.</p>
<p>Two Roads Bureau Chief</p>
<h3>Kuo Cheng-en Assumes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Two Roads Management Bureau, Kuo Cheng-en, arrived at the bureau at 10 a.m. yesterday to assume office. Another swearing-in ceremony will be held at a later date. The details of the inauguration are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrival at the Bureau to Take Over Affairs: Mr. Kuo, accompanied by Secretary-General Li Tse-min, Section Chief Hsi Shih-ta, and six armed guards from the arsenal, arrived at the bureau by car at 10 a.m. After arriving, he was led by the bureau's secretary to the director's office on the second floor to meet with the former director, Luo Pan-hui. Kuo and Luo were old colleagues. After a brief exchange of greetings, they rested for more than ten minutes. Then, Director Luo accompanied Mr. Kuo to the auditorium, and personnel were assigned to transfer and count the official seals and other items one by one. After shaking hands with each of the important officials, Luo and Kuo each gave speeches successively. Then, they gathered in the open space downstairs for a photo and then dispersed.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo's Speech: "Today, Director Kuo has come here to take over, and I am extremely pleased. Director Kuo is an old colleague and has only been away from the bureau for just over a year. Colleagues welcome this time that he is leading the two roads. All of the employees of the two roads have always respected Director Kuo's learning and morality. In the future, I believe Director Kuo will actively develop the two roads, so that the two roads can obtain the most benefits and open a new era. In the years from the fifteenth to the twentieth, we can surely improve the two roads and make them a model railway."</p>
<p>The Director's Address: Roughly stating, "I am ashamed of my limited knowledge and lack of expertise. Now that I hold this position, I am even more fearful. Moreover, I have two fears in my life: one is the fear of promotion, because the higher the position, the more I feel that my abilities are not up to the task. Whether it was at the Hanyehping Company, the arsenal, or in my current position, there has never been a time when I have not been uneasy. As for this time, after receiving the order, I repeatedly resigned, but it was not granted. In the future, I can only do my best to avoid failing in my duty. The second is the fear of layoffs. In everything, many hands make light work, and one hand cannot clap. Misuse is of course impermissible, and excessive exaction is also inappropriate. Therefore, after I take office, I will definitely not change or reduce the existing staff in the bureau in order to become familiar with the work. However, I hope that all colleagues can assist me as they assisted Director Luo, and that everyone can do their best to ensure that the national business can develop."</p>
<p>Kuo's Trip to Peking: The newly appointed Director of the Two Roads Bureau, Kuo Cheng-en, took the night train last night to Peking to thank the committee.</p>

<p>Seamen's Union Reorganization Committee</p>
<h3>Swearing-in Ceremony Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 10 a.m. yesterday, the members of the Seamen's Union Reorganization Committee, Chang Chien-pai, Ho Chen-huan, Mu Ai-i, Wang Yung-sheng, Miao Shui-chang, Chiu Yao-kuan, etc., held a swearing-in ceremony in the auditorium of the Seamen's Union on Qiujiang Road. Present were Central Supervisor Chang Chun, Municipal Party Department Representative Huang Tsao-hsiung, Municipal Government Representative Pan Kung-chan, as well as representatives from the Navigation Administration Bureau, member representatives, guests, and staff, totaling about 300 people. The ceremony was conducted according to protocol. First, each committee member read the oath, followed by an address from Central Committee Member Chang Chun, the gist of which was that the relationship between seamen, workers, and navigation administration is extremely important. Although there has been considerable progress in past reorganizations, it has not yet reached completion. This time, the reorganization must be more complete in order to resist imperialism and achieve the goal of recovering navigation rights. Secondly, it is necessary to cultivate seamen talents so that the country's shipping industry can be developed as much as possible, leading to national prosperity and strength. Next, Municipal Party Department Representative Huang Tsao-hsiung delivered an address, roughly stating that the registration of organizations must have methods, and it is especially necessary to absorb members as much as possible and eliminate regional concepts, so that union affairs can proceed smoothly in the future. Municipal Government Representative Pan Kung-chan then delivered an address, roughly stating that the prosperity or decline of the shipping industry also requires seamen to bear significant responsibility. The past history of seamen has been very good, and it is especially hoped that they will work hard in the future to follow the organization and actively train to achieve the goal of developing the shipping industry. In addition, representatives from the Navigation Administration Bureau and the Middle Cabin Public Office successively gave speeches, which are omitted for brevity. Finally, Chang Chien-pai, a standing committee member of the union, gave a reply. Afterwards, there was a tea party and a photo session before the meeting adjourned.

<h3>Patriotic Acts of Vendors in the City Temple and Yu Garden</h3>
<p>Most of the shops and stalls in the City Temple and Yu Garden in this city sell Japanese goods. Since the Japanese incited Korean people to massacre overseas Chinese, the whole country has been outraged and has enthusiastically boycotted Japanese goods. The Yu Garden Merchants' Promotion Association convened a general meeting and decided to refuse to sell Japanese goods. If there are previously imported stocks, they must be registered with the association before they can be sold, and a deadline is set for registration in order to report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Association. After registration, it will be handled according to regulations. If Japanese goods are imported again after registration, and the investigation confirms it, strict punishment will be carried out according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County's Labor Silver Officially Collected Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai County's 20th-year upper and lower labor silver and grain taxes were officially collected yesterday. The notices were issued to each tax collection clerk to forward to each business owner to pay the tax with the slip. The bureau had previously received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department to transform the strings or change the silver to yuan for collection. However, the bureau had already prepared the grain strings and it was difficult to transform them this year, so the collection was still calculated in silver. Also, the bureau found that the amount of old labor grain taxes owed was still huge, and strictly urged each tax collection clerk to earnestly collect and conclude the taxes. However, each clerk complained that since the Baojia system was abolished, all labor grain taxes were handled by the district township chiefs, and each township chief found it difficult to handle, and delayed with excuses. In the past, if a Baojia was tired, played around, or defaulted, he could be arrested. Now, not only is it impossible to do so, but even a little tightening is met with complaints or even accusations. The clerks are now experiencing difficulties with their duties and are quite passive.</p>
<h3>Prevention and Control of Cholera in Choupu Town</h3>
<p>Municipal Health Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Assist</p>
<p>Two suspected cholera cases were found in Choupu Town, Nanhui County, a few days ago. The Municipal Health Bureau sent personnel to collect stool samples and submit them to the Health Laboratory for testing. It has been proven to be true cholera. Since Choupu Town is very close to Shanghai, it is very easy for the disease to spread into the city. In view of this, the Municipal Health Bureau immediately dispatched five doctors at 7 a.m. yesterday (August 1st), bringing various kinds of epidemic prevention equipment, to Choupu to join the head of the third district of Nanhui County and the sub-bureau chief of the Public Security Bureau to inject cholera vaccine for the residents of Choupu on a household basis. It is planned to inject all the residents of the town, numbering more than 10,000, within a week. It will also investigate the existing cholera patients and send them all to the town's infectious disease hospital for isolation and treatment, while implementing disinfection of feces and advising people to drink boiled water in order to eliminate the cholera in Choupu in a short period of time to avoid spreading to this city. The Municipal Health Bureau will be responsible for the vaccines and all disinfection supplies used for prevention.</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony of the Fishing Vessel Crew Training Course</h3>
<p>Closing Ceremony Held After Completion of the Training</p>
<p>The opening and commencement of the first session of the summer training course for fishing vessel crews held by the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station has been recorded in this newspaper. The association stipulated that the training period would be two weeks. From July 16th, in addition to teaching courses every day, the trainees were led to visit the Yongxin Refrigeration Plant on the 18th and the Xujiahui Observatory on the 24th. Knowledge and skills related to the fishing industry and maritime affairs were taught in detail. Although the sailors encountered hot weather and the repair work on the ships was very tight, they still took the time to come to the lectures on time every day without interruption. The lectures ended on the 31st, and a closing ceremony was held at Yicai Middle School in Datongmen at 5 p.m. that day. In addition to all the sailors attending the course, Huang Ke-chuang, a representative of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, Yang Shu-heng, the captain of the Fuhai warship, Ku Wei-yu, the captain of the Haiyong warship, fisheries expert Zhang Chun-feng, Chen Chu-nian, Ji Guang-han, a technician from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration, Mao Chu-sheng, a representative of the China Fishing Wheel Company, senior crew members of various fishing vessels, as well as Zhang Chu-tsun, the technical director of the station, Chen Shu-yi, a technician and captain, Zhang Yu-sheng, a fisheries surveyor, Wang Lien-sheng, the preparator of the affiliated Fisheries Guidance Institute, and all 60 other staff members. Chairman Wang Wen-tai, the registrar and master of ceremonies Wang Lien-sheng, carried out the ceremony. First, the chairman gave a report, roughly stating that it was commendable that everyone came to listen to the lectures in such hot weather. However, there were deck sailors and engine room sailors who came to listen to the lectures, and because of their different duties, their interest in the lectures was also different, and the teaching was slightly difficult. At present, the fishing industry in our country is still in its infancy, and if we still stand still, we will eventually be eliminated, while advanced countries are laughing at us. We must work hard and make rapid progress to adapt to the trend. This year's training course has passed, but the future is long. If everyone has any questions about maritime affairs that were not covered in the lectures this time, or that they did not understand, or if questions arise at any time in the future, they will be explained immediately upon request. In view of the eastern, southern, and northern advance plans (see fisheries video), we should strive to ensure that the country is the premise, so that our country's fishing industry will become increasingly prosperous. If there is anyone who does not understand the purpose of the training course and asks about it, I dare to declare clearly that the biggest purpose of this training course is to unite the fishing industry, develop our country's fishing industry, and compete with the strong neighbors on the ocean." Then, Huang Ke-chuang, a representative of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, delivered a speech, roughly stating that he admired the long-standing reputation and the fact that everyone who attended the lectures was able to persevere. He was especially fortunate to participate in this grand event. The progress of this training course can prove the gradual realization of the province's fisheries plan, so the future development should take this training course as a starting point. Then, Zhang Zhu-tsun and others delivered speeches, roughly stating that the courses taught in the training course were closely related to the fisheries industry, so that the listeners could slightly supplement their academics and skills, and the business could be improved accordingly. The purpose of the Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station in establishing this association is to make the society aware of the fisheries situation, so that more fisheries companies and more fishing vessels can be built. The establishment of the experiment station is not to rent boats to catch and harvest to imitate commercial companies. It must make all kinds of contributions to the fishing industry so that the general public has a considerable understanding of the fishing industry. The crew training course is one of the responsibilities that must be fulfilled. The meeting was adjourned at 6 p.m. From 7 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., a fisheries video was shown, and people from all walks of life came to visit, making it a grand occasion for a while.</p>

<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association, in conjunction with the City Chamber of Commerce, the Machine Association, and the Promotion Association, held a banquet at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant at 6:00 p.m. yesterday to welcome Mr. Yang Wenquan, the director of the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry. More than 20 people attended. After the wine flowed, Wang Xiaolai first raised his glass to give a welcome speech, followed by Director Yang, who stood up to report, roughly stating that he had three major missions in Shanghai this time: (1) To express condolences to the comrades in the national products market; (2) To solicit exhibits for the educational supplies exhibition; (3) To discuss the implementation of the All-China Games market. He was very honored and deeply ashamed to receive a banquet from various groups and praise from Chairman Wang. The planned Ministry of Education Supplies Exhibition has been supported by major libraries in Shanghai and the solicitation has begun smoothly. It is also planned to take advantage of the All-China Games to host a market and all on-site advertisements will be national products to promote the concept of promoting national products to students and overseas Chinese. To seek sales channels for national goods, it is necessary to rely on the Shanghai factories and leaders from all walks of life to give full assistance. Wang Jie-an, a representative of the National Goods Maintenance Association, Lu Xing-zhuang, a representative of the Factory Association, Ji Jian-nan, a representative of the Machine Association, and Chen Yi-ting, a representative of the Promotion Association, successively expressed their opinions and had deep expressions and precise guidelines for the planning of the National Games market. Summarizing the opinions of the representatives, the preliminary methods were decided as follows: (1) The four national goods groups will jointly telegraph the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the two ministries of Industry and Education, and the organizing committee of the National Games to request that the market and advertisements of the National Games be all national goods. (2) Each group will convene a membership meeting to solicit opinions. (3) It was decided to hold a joint meeting of representatives of the four groups on the 4th of this month, and the China National Goods Maintenance Association was publicly promoted as the convener. The China National Goods Maintenance Association immediately telegraphed the National Games Organizing Committee yesterday to adopt it in line with the central government's seven national goods movement guidelines.</p>
<h3>Two Important Letters Regarding the Sino-Cuban Joint Sugar Factory</h3>
<p>Denial of Promotion and Commission Representations</p>
<p>The two important letters between Xu, a technical supervisor of the Ministry of Industry, and the China International Sugar Company, are disclosed as follows: (1) Xu, the technical supervisor of the Ministry of Industry, wrote a letter stating: "According to a report on July 19th, Zheng Zenan's opinion on the draft agreement of the Sino-Cuban sugar factory stated that Cuban representative Mr. Prader had established the China International Sugar Company at 12 Guangdong Road, Shanghai, and was actively recruiting managers for promotion, and that according to the China International Sugar Company, the factory gave the agents a commission of 5%, and the company transferred the commission to the agents at 4%. It is shocking to hear this. Domestic sugar merchants are especially confused. I am writing to inquire whether your company has ever made such representations. I hope that you will give a proper reply. The sugar factory that the Ministry of Industry is currently planning to organize is still in the planning stage and has not yet contacted your company or any other party for promotion, nor has it promised anyone 5% or any commission. If your company has indeed made the above-mentioned representations, then to whom does the so-called 'factory' refer? I also hope that you will give a clear reply. Although your company is said to be affiliated with the International Sugar Company of Havana, Cuba, as announced by Mr. Prader in the Western press, the Ministry of Industry believes that your company's business has absolutely nothing to do with the state-owned sugar refinery and makes a joint statement. I hope you will check this." (2) The China International Sugar Company replied to Xu, the technical supervisor: "Upon reading your letter of July 20, it is understood that our company has absolutely not made such representations in the report on July 19. Especially after Mr. Prader left China, our company has not announced any business guidelines. We hope you will observe this carefully and make a joint statement."</p>
<p>A Horrific Report from Shanghai on the Fuyang and Yingshang Floods</p>
<p>The floods in Fuyang and Yingshang counties in northern Anhui this year are extremely severe. Fellow villagers from Fuyang and Yingshang in Shanghai recently received letters from fellow villagers in Suzhou, Zhao Lian-chou, Hua Shi-an, Wang Zong-yi, Cheng Ya-zhou, and Liu Yun-qing, reporting on the disaster and requesting a unified appeal. The original letter stated: "We have learned that since the harvest of wheat in Fuyang and Yingshang counties last month, it has been raining continuously for more than a month. Then, mountain floods and floods occurred. As a result, the waters of the Huai, Ying, and Hong rivers rose simultaneously, like a sea overturning, rushing down from the sky, instantly turning thousands of miles into a marshland. In the low-lying areas, people could not escape, and entire families were buried in the belly of fish. Countless livestock and houses were swept away by the floods, leaving nothing behind. It is heartbreaking to talk about the disaster that struck in an instant. The most tragic thing is that the victims are the crowds of women, children, and elderly who are dying. They either climb to high places to wait for rescue or cling to trees to survive. Braving the rain and howling wind, their lives hang in the balance. The cries of gods and ghosts can be heard for thousands of miles. Those who are fortunate enough to be rescued are the remnants of the pot, living on high ground, either gathered in groups of ten or hundreds, or in groups of three or five. The corners of the mountains and cities are filled with naked and starving people, their faces colorless. They are barely surviving, and they will fall at the slightest breeze. Mothers are crying for their children, and wives are crying for their husbands. The nights and days are filled with unbearable misery. The victims of this disaster number no less than a million. The scale of this catastrophe is unprecedented. The height of the water is more than Zhangxun higher than the breach of the Yellow River in Zhengzhou during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. The upstream flooding is no less than the ancient times. Now that the wind and rain have not stopped, the downstream is stagnant, and the water level is increasing. It is difficult to retreat immediately. At this time, the city and town are several feet deep in water and are on the verge of danger. How can the city be preserved? Moreover, the millions of victims are eagerly awaiting relief. I am afraid that the slightest delay will leave no one behind. According to repeated reports from the Red Cross societies of the two counties and representatives of the victims, in addition to recommending representatives to the Central Disaster Relief Committee to beg for relief, we implore fellow villagers in Shanghai to make a unified appeal so that philanthropists at home and abroad can generously provide assistance.</p>

<p>Municipal Public Finance</p>
<h3>Joint Proclamation by Two Bureaus</h3>
<p>Prohibition of the Lighterage Guild</p>
<p>Imitating Ship Licenses to Collect Membership Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Finance Bureau issued a proclamation yesterday stating: Regarding the joint proclamation, the Shanghai Lighterage Trade Association posted a notice establishing patrol boats to collect membership fees from boat owners. Previously, this bureau, etc., due to the ship class listed in the membership certificates issued by the association, charged monthly fees, and the ship licenses and stamp styles were the same as those formulated by this city. We sent a letter to the Social Bureau to investigate and reply for verification. Now, Public Letter No. 11631 states that the bureau previously received a request from the association to file records of the association's proposed ship markings and membership certificate styles. The bureau replied that the use of porcelain blue background with white characters for ship markings by various firms would easily be confused with the licenses issued by the Municipal Public Works Bureau, and it would not be appropriate to approve them. Regarding the association's proposal to paste a photo of the member on the membership certificate, the regulations of the Industry and Commerce Guild stipulate that companies and firms are the units, and there is no need to paste photos. The request for filing should not be discussed, etc. It is noted that the association's regulations have not been submitted to this bureau for approval. Now, based on the above, in addition to strictly ordering the association not to engage in the above-mentioned activities and sending separate letters, a letter is prepared to reply, hoping for investigation, etc. Based on this investigation, the Lighterage Trade Association's regulations have not been submitted to the competent authorities for approval, and they dare to imitate the ship licenses in the city and collect fees based on ship class. This is extremely inappropriate and should be strictly prohibited to prevent counterfeiting. In addition to jointly reporting to the municipal government and sending a letter to the Public Security Bureau to instruct the water and land police stations to strictly crack down on it, a proclamation is issued to inform all boat owners.</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau</p>
<h3>Scheduled Repair of the Northern Section of Tongzhou Road</h3>

<p>Wusong</p>
<h3>Rickshaw and Small Cart Strike</h3>
<p>Request to Reduce Monthly Donations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau Wusong Vehicle Donation Collection Office was officially established yesterday and began collecting donations. The rickshaw donation set by the bureau, including the license fee, is a total of one yuan and six jiao per month. The general rickshaw pullers believe that the donation rate set by the bureau is too large and they cannot afford it, so they all went on strike yesterday, gathering three or four hundred rickshaw pullers and small carts. They petitioned the vehicle donation office to request a reduction in the donation rate and immediately went to the Eighth District Party Headquarters for assistance. Shen Risheng and Wang Yucheng, members of the district party headquarters standing committee, considering that the situation of rickshaw pullers in Wusong is different from that in Shanghai, their lives are extremely difficult, and they cannot afford huge donations, which is indeed the case. They invited Director Zhang of the Vehicle Donation Collection Office to discuss reduction measures, instructing the rickshaw pullers to resume work first and proposing that the annual registration fee be one yuan and the monthly donation be four jiao per vehicle. Director Zhang stated that the vehicle donation was set by a higher authority and could not be decided arbitrarily. He would report the proposed measures to the director and then reply. However, the general coolie rickshaw pullers believed that the vehicle donation office had no concrete measures and had to reluctantly sacrifice, so yesterday the rickshaws and small carts between Wusong and Baoshan disappeared, and travelers felt greatly inconvenienced.</p>

<p>The Public Concession Police Force Vehicle Office statistics for July show that there were a total of 1,116 vehicle accidents within the territory, setting a new record in the history of the concession, an increase of 15 cases compared to June.

Since New Year's Day, there have been a total of 7,009 accidents, with 75 deaths and 2,933 injuries.

<p>Now Understood, Therefore Withdrawn</p>
<p>Huang Jianzhen hired lawyer Shi Zhuoren to file a complaint against Chen Gongzhe, the former chief of the General Affairs Section of the Ministry of Railways, for indecent assault in the Special Court. The Special Court had already summoned him once, but because the defendant Chen Gongzhe was far away in Nanyang and could not appear in court, he only appointed lawyer Huang Yuping to appear in court for interrogation. The decree changed the date to summon the defendant to court for further interrogation. This morning, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the interrogation in a broad court. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Shi, stated that the plaintiff had previously been deceived, resulting in the lawsuit. Now that she understood, the plaintiff voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit, etc. The defendant's lawyer, Huang Yuping, stated that the plaintiff was a weak woman and did not want to delve into the matter after being deceived. Judge Wu then allowed the plaintiff to withdraw the case. Thus, the sensational social lawsuit was declared over.</p>

The Social Bureau said that whether the manager's responsibility for the Sansin Yarn Factory Co., Ltd. could be discharged because it had been handed over to the liquidator. However, the old account books of Tongshan Hall before the 17th year of the Republic of China had not been submitted. The manager still had difficulty shirking responsibility. Yesterday, Sheng Yulin was strictly ordered to submit all the old account books of the hall before the 17th year of the Republic of China within ten days.</p>

<p>Outside the Boundary Road Section</p>
<h3>Details of Telephone Installation Problems</h3>
<p>Negotiations Gradually Come to a Standstill</p>
<p>The installation of telephones along the roads outside the boundary by the American Shanghai Telephone Company (the successor to the Shanghai Sino-Foreign Telephone Company) was originally based on the appendix to the telephone contract signed between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the former Sino-Foreign Telephone Company on December 17, the 14th year of the Republic of China. The contract stipulated a term of five years until December 16, the 19th year. After the contract expired, the appendix also expired. Since then, the company's installation of telephones along the roads outside the boundary has been without any basis. To maintain sovereignty, it is naturally impossible to allow it to continue adding installations. Even the existing telephone machines and pole-line equipment should be removed in full to comply with the law. However, residents in the area need telephones very much. Before the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has reached the line, it is impossible not to take care of both aspects and consider another appropriate method to maintain telephone communications under appropriate conditions. Therefore, on the day the above-mentioned telephone contract expired (December 17, the 9th year), the director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the general manager of the Shanghai Telephone Company were invited to discuss an oral proposal to establish a temporary contract so that citizens who had installed telephones could avoid interruption, and those who had not installed telephones could also add installations. Later, after several discussions, the installation of telephones on the roads outside the boundary was stopped. In order to quickly solve the problem, a draft of this contract was drafted. The main points are: (1) The contract is valid from December 17, the 19th year, to June 30, the 21st year. Both parties should discuss long-term measures within this period. (2) The telephones installed by the company in the South Shanghai, Zhabei, and Pudong districts will be recovered by the telephone bureau at any time. (3) The company shall not install any telephone equipment within the other party's area, except for those who have filled out a certificate for the Shanghai Public Works Bureau to approve the installation of the company's telephone in areas outside the boundary road where the Chinese telephone authority line has not reached. (4) The company should pay a considerable amount of remuneration to the municipal government. (5) In the event of a major accident, the suspension of telephone service must first be approved by the municipal government and the concession authorities. (6) The company shall comply with all relevant laws and regulations promulgated by the Chinese government. (7) This contract and subsequent correspondence between the two parties shall be based on Chinese. On May 22, the responsible representatives of both parties were invited to a meeting to discuss. The company indicated that it would have to increase telephone fees for relevant users for the remuneration. The Public Works Bureau firmly denied this. Regarding the two points that "the suspension of telephone service must first be approved by the Chinese and foreign municipal authorities" and "based on Chinese," the company representative also believed that it needed to be considered and asked them to submit their opinions for further discussion. Later, the company did not express any opinions for a long time, and residents in the area outside the boundary road who requested to install telephones came one after another. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau repeatedly urged the company to express its opinions as soon as possible. Finally, on June 26 and 27, consecutive meetings were held. The company representative admitted that it would no longer collect compensation from users for the remuneration. The other articles were also properly settled. However, when Zhao, the director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and Kilrok, the general manager of the company, met with the Public Works Bureau on July 15, the general manager expressed concerns about complying with the central laws and regulations and the Wai Zhang penalty rules set by the municipal government, saying that it was inconvenient to comply due to his status as a foreign merchant. The Public Works Bureau and the Telephone Bureau stated that since the company was operating in the Chinese area, it was unreasonable not to comply with Chinese laws. Therefore, the negotiations temporarily came to a standstill.</p>
<h3>Origin of Bullets Under the Floor</h3>
<p>Used by a Business Group Organized Ten Years Ago</p>
<p>At about 9:00 am the day before yesterday, three sacks containing a total of 6,500 rounds of rifle bullets were found under the floor of the brick wall on the east side of Taipingli, Xiwuchang Road, Hongkou, which was being demolished. Deng Da and Shen Zhaochun, the workers, reported to the Hongkou Police Force, which sent Hu Guangrong, a Chinese detective, and Chinese police officer No. 1385 to take all the bullets to the police station for temporary storage. Yesterday, it was sent to the Third Tribunal of the Special Court. Li Zhishan, the lawyer representing the police force, stated that the investigation revealed that the owner of the house was Jiang Xinjia, who had moved to No. 4 Nanyang Road. His family said that the bullets were used by a business group organized ten years ago. The group was not established and was abandoned. Therefore, the bullets were rusty and could not be used. The rusty bullets were presented for inspection and requested to be confiscated. Judge Feng approved the report and ordered the 6,500 rounds of rifle bullets to be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Jin Nian Gen Shot and Killed</h3>
<p>Jin Nian Gen, a local man, 36 years old, opened the Jin Yongchang Paint Workshop at the intersection of Pingliang Road. He himself was a paint foreman in the Water Company. He was diligent and frugal, so he had some savings. At 6:30 am yesterday morning, Jin went to the factory to work as usual. However, just as he stepped out the door and walked a few steps, a person jumped out from behind and, without asking why, used an axe to slash Nian Gen three times, one axe on the right waist, one axe on the back, and one axe on the left arm. The injuries were so severe that he died immediately. When the patrol officers arrived, the murderer had already disappeared like Huanghe, and they could only take the body to the Tongren Hospital and then to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Russian Man Drove a Prostitute Into the Mud</h3>

<p>Forcibly Demanding Assistance and Beating People</p>
<p>The Russian, Xibaqishilin, drove a car with a prostitute named Sheng Baoyu on Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai when the engine broke down and the car became stuck in the mud and could not move. Wang A, who was driving a commercial car, happened to pass by. The Russian blocked Wang's path and forced Wang to use the car to pull his car out of the mud. Wang said that it was impossible to pull it. The Russian then beat Wang, causing injuries and bleeding to his head and face. Patrol police arrived and arrested the Russian, who fled to the boundary and was arrested by the French Concession Shanzhong Road Police Force and transferred to the Second Branch of the Sixth District for presentation to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, he was transferred to the local court for trial.</p>
<h3>Old Woman from Songjiang Missing in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Hired a Rickshaw to the North Station</p>
<p>Lost in the Middle of the Car, No Place to Find Her</p>
<p>Li Tangshi, an old woman from Songjiang, 50 years old, is weak and sickly, with a thin yellow face, missing front teeth, short stature, and small feet. She is dressed in an ancient blue silk shirt and silk pants, with her name, origin, and residence hidden on her person, as well as 40 yuan in paper money for unexpected expenses. She carries a white leather suitcase, a rattan clip, and a white cloth bag. At about 2:00 pm yesterday (the 31st), she hired a rickshaw (number unknown) on Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession to go to the North Station passenger pick-up area. Her eldest son, Daonan, borrowed his younger brother, Yinglong, and took the No. 5 tram to the station to pick up his mother and go to Suzhou. However, they waited until 7:00 pm without seeing their mother. They were very anxious and searched everywhere without any trace. They went to the police station to inquire and reported to the Public Security Bureau Branch, etc. It is believed that the frail old woman may have had an accident such as a collision on the way due to a sudden illness. It is hoped that the competent authorities and local kind gentlemen will provide information if they have any information, and send it to Xu Yousheng, Spring River Hotel behind the Great World in the French Concession, or 122 Ruifuli, Zilaihuo Street, so that the mother and son can meet. They will be grateful and repay you without limit.</p>
<h3>Dismissal of a Chinese Merchant Tram Conductor</h3>
<p>Wu Peizhang</p>
<p>Wu Peizhang, ticket seller No. 129 of the China Merchants Electric Company, was temporarily suspended for insulting passengers. Wu was suspended for more than two months and falsely used the company's name to solicit rumors, promising to introduce people to sell tickets, etc., and defrauded Shi Chengzhang of 19 yuan as an introduction fee. After Shi gave the money to Wu, he repeatedly asked for the work date. Wu evasively gave Shi a changed version of the company's vehicle regulations, instructing him to go to the company on August 1 for an examination and then he could work. Therefore, at about 9:00 am yesterday, Shi went to the company to inquire about the matter and was detected by the vehicle office. When questioned by Shi, he truthfully reported that Wu Peizhang had spent money to campaign for the vehicle office and told him to come to the company for an examination today and then he could work. He also presented a changed version of the vehicle regulations. General Manager Lu Bohong learned of the situation and was extremely angry. He ordered Shi Chengzhang to wait for a while and sent someone to bring Wu Peizhang into the company. The vehicle office director, Zhu Shaoqi, and the standing committee member of the trade union ordered Wu Peizhang to verify the handwriting. Wu could not deny it and admitted it without concealment. Therefore, the company believed that the ticket seller dared to falsely use the company's name to defraud money, which was a criminal offense. In addition to dismissing Wu Peizhang, a letter was prepared and sent to the Second Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer to the local court for trial.</p>

The association has appointed Li Yunmen and Yin Shunzhang to go there on the due date.</p>
<h3>Siblings Sue Each Other, Verdict</h3>
<p>The story of the children of Yu Jintang, the owner of Gu Jinji Construction Factory, suing each other has been reported previously. Now it is learned that Jintang was originally from a poor family. He started from scratch and worked hard. In his later years, he started a construction business. First, he rented land to build houses, and then he bought the land at a price. At the time of his death, he had some savings and owned two acres of land on Gordon Road and three acres of land in Zhabei. In the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China, Jintang and his wife passed away one after another. His daughter, Zhenhua, was 25 years old, and his son, Zhenmin, was 15 years old. The siblings lived together in harmony. The sister managed all the current funds were used to open the funeral. The real estate has been preserved over the years. Later, Zhenmin fell in love with someone at school and became restless. He would go home every day and ask his sister for money. If he did not get what he wanted, he would say bad things. Since then, the relationship has deteriorated slightly. Last year, when the male married and the female married, Zhenmin requested a separation of property and invited six relatives, including his maternal uncle and other relatives, to draw up a property separation contract, stating that the property deeds would be kept in the bank and the siblings would only use the rent and could not sell the property. After Zhenmin got married, he sued his sister for criminal offenses such as opium addiction, property encroachment, and injury. The sister was not established. The sister then filed a complaint in court requesting the cancellation of the contract and requesting that her sister move out of the residence. At the previous court hearing, her maternal grandmother, Song Wangshi, and her maternal uncle, Song Weiqin, testified, proving that the property separation was fair and Zhenmin was adopted by a foreign surname after three months with 20 yuan. Her sister, Zhenhua, was her biological daughter. At 10:00 am yesterday morning, the plaintiff's suit was rejected and the litigation costs were borne by the plaintiff.</p>
<h3>Yao Xiuqing's Lawsuit for Cohabitation</h3>
<p>Mediation Fails, Formal Lawsuit Filed</p>
<p>Zhong Shunguang, a Guangdong native residing at No. 297 Yuexiufang, Hainin Road, married Yao Xiuqing in the 16th year of the Republic. Since their marriage, their relationship has been harmonious. However, Zhong's father, Eyun, recently succumbed to rumors, refused to acknowledge Yao as his daughter-in-law, subjected her to abuse, and instructed his son to refuse cohabitation. Yao, left with no other option, engaged lawyer Yue Junying to file a complaint with the Special District Court, demanding that her husband resume cohabitation. The trial commenced at 9:00 AM yesterday, presided over by judge Ying Shi. Zhong Shunguang failed to appear. Yao Xiuqing testified that on the sixth day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar in the 16th year of the Republic, she married the defendant with matchmakers Shen Gu and Zhu Baoxiang. Initially, they lived in harmony. Since the 18th year of the Republic, the defendant only showed up for the three daily meals, and there were months or ten days he did not return. On the eighth day of the fourth month of this year in the lunar calendar, the defendant falsely claimed that the plaintiff mentioned her aunt, Zhang, thus starting an inquisition and falsely claiming that the plaintiff spoke ill of his mother and son, without explaining, and slapped the plaintiff's face twice. The plaintiff, helpless and weak, thought of escaping downstairs, but Zhong Zhang grabbed her arm with one hand and pulled out an iron hairpin with the other, violently scratching her own arm until it bled. Then, she went downstairs and told the audience that her daughter-in-law cursed his mother and son and even caused her to bleed. At that time, the plaintiff had no choice but to return to her mother's house. On the thirteenth day of the fifth month, she suddenly received a letter from Zhong Zhang, accusing her of harming a senior relative and instructing her elder brother, Qichang, to go for a meeting. During the meeting, the defendant suddenly brought up the issue of divorce, which shocked the plaintiff. Although she earnestly persuaded him, it was to no avail. Recently, the defendant used the confiscation of dowry jewelry as a condition, so she specifically came to court to file a complaint, demanding cohabitation and requesting the court to order the defendant to bear alimony of 5,000 yuan. The judge stated that the case was difficult to mediate, and since the defendant was absent without reason, he immediately announced that mediation was unsuccessful, and a formal lawsuit was filed.</p>

<h3>Jing'an Temple Establishes Temporary Hospital</h3>
<p>Jing'an Temple in West Shanghai is a famous ancient temple, with generations of eminent monks and virtuous figures. Last spring, the local gentry elected monk Zhifa to succeed as abbot. Since then, he has reorganized the interior. The monk is enthusiastic about public welfare undertakings and spares no effort in his support, which has been widely praised by society. Between last summer and autumn, he organized Jing'an Temporary Hospital in the temple to provide free medical consultations and medications, achieving remarkable results. Recently, as epidemic diseases are prevalent again and the poor people in the Jing'an Temple area live in crowded conditions, they are unable to seek medical treatment when they fall ill, which is truly pitiful. In view of this, Zhifa, together with local gentry Wang Hancheng, Xu Wenyuan, Zhang Pinshan, Gong Yifei, and others, launched a temporary hospital. They have now invited registered national physicians Jiang Zhongqiu, Chen Yusheng, Gong Yifei, Xu Zhonghuan, Hou Weide, and more than a dozen other famous doctors to provide free medical consultations and medications.

<h3>Letters Received</h3>
<h3>Mr. Chen Da on the Implementation Issues of China's Factory Law</h3>
<p>(3) Discussion on Compensation and Pensions and Other Important Provisions (1) Compensation for Illness, Injury, Disability, and Death Due to Work: China's Factory Law stipulates that workers who suffer illness, injury, disability, or death during their employment are entitled to compensation. Many factories are already paying considerable attention to these issues. Although the circumstances are complex, the methods and amounts of compensation vary. Some factories pay medical expenses for workers' illnesses, regardless of whether the illness is directly related to their employment. Some factories pay compensation for work-related illnesses (according to their answers on the forms). In practice, they do not pay a fixed amount for each type of illness. Older workers generally receive preferential treatment from the factory when they become ill, such as sick leave and medical expenses, regardless of the cause of the illness. New workers do not receive such generous treatment, which is understandable because the symptoms and causes of illness are difficult to prove. However, this is not the case with accidents. It is usually easy to prove the cause and state of the accident after a worker is injured. Since it can be proven, the factory is willing to be responsible for compensation, so accident compensation is more common and employers generally have no complaints. Based on this survey, regarding illness (mostly work-related), 72 factories do not pay wages (or compensation), 133 factories do. Regarding medical expenses, 36 factories do not pay, and 151 factories do. Regarding accidents, 65 factories do not pay wages, 137 factories do. Regarding medical expenses, 18 factories do not pay, and 185 factories do. Disability occurs when a worker suffers serious injury, has a physical defect, and loses the ability to work. In this unfortunate situation, factories generally take a lenient approach, often providing wages or compensation for a certain period. As for death, factories are even more generous. Regardless of whether the death is work-related, as long as the deceased's family is in difficult circumstances, they can generally receive compensation. This spirit of relief has always been common in Chinese society. In the past, when social forces were strong, relief efforts were greatly promoted. Today, modern industries, whether or not influenced by labor unions, still retain this custom. However, the actual amount is not much. Compensation for injuries and illnesses can be considered a major economic burden for factories. Although this survey does not have much material on this part (see the statistical table in the appendix), a large-scale factory provided a table outlining the situation regarding illness from April 1920 to April 1921. This factory pays compensation or medical expenses for every illness, regardless of the cause. Illness is a more difficult issue. Many employers in Shanghai say that illness is difficult to prove, and workers often complain that many ailments cannot be proven at all. Because it cannot be proven, the factory does not grant sick leave or pay wages or medical expenses, causing the patient to suffer. The United Kingdom and Japan have already implemented health insurance laws, which have solved the problem of illness. China's industrialization is still in its infancy, and there is no need for health insurance laws for the time being. However, health is an important issue for factory hygiene. We can select several industrial diseases that are easier to prove, such as lead poisoning and phosphorus poisoning, and provide compensation and medical expenses. The Indian Factory Act has provisions for industrial diseases, and China should adopt this approach. The factory laws of the United Kingdom and several other European and American industrial countries do not include articles on worker compensation because the British Factory Act was implemented in the early 19th century, but the worker compensation law was not implemented until the end of the 19th century by Germany. Therefore, countries that formulated factory laws earlier do not include worker compensation. China formulated its factory law later, and its degree of industrialization is not high. There is no need for a separate compensation law for the time being. It is appropriate to temporarily incorporate compensation articles into the factory law. It is not too late to formulate a worker compensation law when the degree of industrialization is higher in the future. India and Japan both include compensation articles in their factory laws. Regarding compensation for injuries, the Japanese Factory Act stipulates wages equal to 180 days wages decreased to 40 percent. The Chinese Factory Law stipulates two-thirds of six months' wages, then equal to one-half of wages, limited to one year. Regarding permanent disability, the Japanese Factory Act stipulates 360 to 540 days' wages. The Indian Factory Act stipulates 3,500 rupees. The Chinese Factory Law stipulates one to three years' wages. Regarding death, India stipulates 5,400 rupees. Japan stipulates 360 days' wages. China stipulates two years' wages, plus a pension of 300 yuan. Japan gives 30 yuan for funeral expenses. China gives 50 yuan. We believe that the principles and amounts of compensation in the Factory Law regarding pensions and compensation should be preserved. However, due to technical difficulties, the illness item can only be handled by employers and workers themselves, and the government does not need to stipulate it in explicit terms. However, industrial diseases should be added because industrial diseases are easier to prove and are closely related to workers' health. (2) Education for Child Labor and Apprentices: 151 factories reported no education, and 55 factories did. However, we cannot determine what kind of education they are providing because some are schools for workers' children, which are not schools set up for child labor because workers' children are not directly employed by the factory. Some factories give monthly or annual subsidies to labor unions to run education. Some factories subsidize nearby schools to allow workers to enroll. Very few factories run their own schools, except for public utilities. The schooling time for child labor is mostly outside of working hours because the working hours for child labor are very long, and they are physically and mentally exhausted. Therefore, they do not benefit much from education. Our suggestion for working hours is that child labor currently works ten hours a day. After two years, day shift child labor should work eight hours a day and receive two hours of education. We believe that education is a complex issue. Issues such as education policy, economic organization, and school location cannot be resolved in two years. At the same time, we argue that education for child labor and apprentices is more important than education for adult workers because child labor and apprentices are younger and easier to enroll. If they receive adequate education, they can become useful citizens in society and knowledgeable leaders in the industrial world, guiding the labor union movement to cooperate with capital, improve labor-capital relations, and increase production. This seems more fundamental than adult worker education. The education policy should be determined by the local government's education authorities, and the teaching materials should be the same. However, the expenses should be shared by the government and employers. Foreign capitalists believe that this education is fundamentally the responsibility of the government and has nothing to do with industry (but foreign countries have a tax system, so industry is actually indirectly responsible for the economic costs). Chinese capitalists are willing to bear the expenses but are unwilling to assume the responsibility for education. In practice, the responsibility and method of education should be borne by the education authorities. The workers' demands for education are consistent. However, they also see the complexity of this issue and do not know how to get the opportunity for education. The United Kingdom applies a half-day school system to child labor. Child labor must attend school for half a day every day or one day every two days. India has not fully provided education for child labor, but many factories automatically have educational facilities in the factory. We believe that within two years of the implementation of the Factory Law, the education authorities should study the relevant issues of worker education with employers and labor organizations so that after two years, the working hours of child labor can be reduced to eight hours a day, allowing child labor and apprentices to receive two hours of education per day. (3) Bonuses: The bonus system is very common in China. The most common is paying double wages at the end of the year, ranging from half a month to one month. Other bonuses include production awards and attendance awards. The lower ones account for slightly more than 1 percent of wages, and the higher ones account for about 8 percent of wages. Labor-capital conditions agreed upon by employers and labor unions often include a bonus clause. For example, the employee treatment conditions of the Shanghai North Silk Factory Workers' Union stipulate that the surplus will be divided into thirteen parts, one of which will be used as a bonus. All employees except the manager are entitled to a share. According to this survey, 174 factories pay bonuses, and 35 do not. Some factories pay bonuses every year at the end of the year, while others only pay when business is prosperous and there is a surplus. However, ordinary bonuses are more common, such as wage increases. For example, a worker who works 20 days a month can get 24 days' wages. For example, the silk reeling industry gets double wages every Sunday in June of the lunar calendar. For example, those with good production results receive bonuses in addition to wages. Article 14 of the Factory Law regarding bonuses or profit distribution seems too broad. Some factories take this article as a kind of profit-sharing system or worker profit-sharing system, believing that factories cannot recognize the ambiguous provisions of the law regarding profits or bonuses, which will lead to labor-capital disputes. They are willing to distribute bonuses to workers according to custom, and the custom has gradually become common, but they are unwilling to have legal regulations for fear of misunderstandings. The remedy seems to be to have a ratio of bonuses to wages. As it stands, bonuses should be at least equal to 4 percent of wages, which should not be difficult under normal circumstances. (4) Maternity Benefits: 63 factories pay maternity benefits. Many factories in this survey do not use female workers. Among the factories that do, roughly one-third pay maternity benefits. However, the amount and method of payment vary greatly. Many factories allow pregnant women to take leave when they are about to give birth. They can return to work after the leave, but they do not receive wages during the leave. Many factories pay a portion of the wages during the maternity leave. Many factories also give a certain number of days of vacation and pay wages and benefits during the vacation. The lowest amount of maternity benefits is 3 yuan, and the highest is 265 yuan. The shortest vacation is two weeks, and the longest is six weeks. The standard for payment (based on the mother's wages is from one and a half weeks to six weeks. The International Labor Organization's regulations on maternity benefits is eight weeks' wages, but very few countries can meet this standard. Our survey did not find any factory that meets this standard. Maternity benefits can be considered a very heavy economic burden for industry because there are about 173,000 female workers in Shanghai, most of whom will get married and become mothers. A certain factory employs 4,500 female workers. In 1930, there were 936 mothers and they paid 36,284 yuan in benefits. They feel that production is also difficult to prove. A certain factory had 2,008 mothers in 1930 and paid 15,068 yuan in benefits, or about 8 yuan per person. Many factories say that female workers are very careful, patient, and skilled at manual work. Since this is the case, industry recognizes that female workers are indispensable, so industry should also bear considerable responsibility for the production of female workers. However, in order to distribute the economic burden of industry, it seems that the maternity benefit can be implemented one year later. Each maternity benefit is equal to four weeks' wages, meaning that the mother gets four weeks of rest, and wages are paid during the rest period. However, pregnant women must be certified by a doctor designated by the factory before giving birth to prevent abuses. The above-mentioned clauses have an economic impact on industry when the Factory Law is implemented, so it is necessary to study the economic capacity and economic burden of industry. However, in addition to the economic impact, there are other aspects, such as (a) employment relationship and (b) safety and health, which are described separately below. (5) Employment Relationship: (a) Principles of Wages: Some capitalists believe that the employment relationship is not within the scope of the Factory Law. The right to negotiate and the right to contract are the freedom of employers and workers and have nothing to do with the government. This view is unconsciously based on the narrow definition of the Factory Law, which is the crystallization of Western social thought in the 19th century. For example, the British Factory Act does not include the issue of wages. The establishment of occupational committees is mainly aimed at eliminating industries with harsh treatment, but the establishment of this committee was not due to the amendment of the 1901 Factory Act, but was produced by other laws. However, the scope of the Japanese Factory Act is wider and similar to China's Factory Law, so the inclusion of wages in China's Factory Law caters to the modern social situation. However, because there is no research on the cost of living in various places, the clause "the wage rate is based on the cost of living of workers in the location of the factory" is difficult to implement for the time being. Our hope is that the government will promptly select a committee to investigate the cost of living in various important industrial and commercial areas and compile an index to prepare the minimum wage in various important industrial and commercial areas. China has recently approved the International Minimum Wage Convention, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has begun to plan the work after the approval. We believe that this is a scientific method to solve the wage problem. In the section on rest days and holidays, we have already pointed out the important relationship between that section and wages. The labor movement in recent years has demanded wage increases as a major condition, which is correct. To seek a fundamental solution, wages must be based on the workers' cost of living. Once wages are sufficient to make a living, the problem of rest days and holidays will be solved satisfactorily. If China's cost of living survey can be effective within three years of the implementation of the Factory Law, then there will be a solution to wages. Therefore, we believe that the inclusion of wage principles in the Factory Law is correct. However, the implementation of this article must wait until the cost of living survey has results. (b) Factory Conference: Whether in the forms or in the conversation, only one employer supports the factory conference, and four workers actively oppose it. The rest of the employers are unwilling to publicly express their opinions on this issue, but they often reveal their opposition in friendly conversations. The reasons for the opposition can be described as follows: (a) The representatives of the factory conference are organized by 5 to 9 people from labor and capital. The capital side believes that it is difficult to represent this level, which has been pointed out by the China General Chamber of Commerce. However, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that the factory can elect representatives outside the factory to supplement it. (b) Workers lack education and experience and find it difficult to be on an equal footing with the factory to seek actual responsibility for industry. (c) Labor and capital already have organs to communicate with each other. When workers have something to say, they can often be told to the management department by the foreman. Most labor unions support the factory conference. They advocate that worker representatives be limited to labor union officials and plan to expand the scope of the factory conference, not only to employment situations, but also to the ordinary problems of labor and capital. Can the foreman represent the meaning of the workers? Generally speaking, the foreman (sometimes the labor union leader) is difficult to represent the true meaning of the workers, so it is necessary for both labor and capital to establish an organ for mutual communication. Currently, there are 83 factories with labor unions and 112 without labor unions. Foreign factories generally do not have labor unions. Labor unions cannot replace factory conferences. The powers of the factory conferences currently prescribed are too broad and may be difficult to implement. It is better to temporarily limit the powers to discussion with the important purpose of mutual communication. (c) Work Contract: As it stands, 130 factories have no work contract and 97 have one. Among them, 81 are individual contracts and 16 are collective contracts. The so-called collective contracts are mostly signed by employers and labor unions. Many workers believe that the Chinese custom generally holds an indefinite view of employment. Employers will not dismiss workers unless they are at fault. When the dismissal time comes, the long-term workers are generally at the end of the year and the beginning of the year, so the dismissed workers have considerable preparation for finding a job. The provisions of the work contract stipulate that as long as both labor and capital are willing to sign a contract, the contract can be terminated under certain circumstances. Some workers are unwilling to give up this contract lightly because the labor-capital conditions they have signed with the capital in recent years are more favorable, and new contracts can be signed under certain circumstances. Employers believe that the reasons listed in the chapter on work contracts regarding dismissal have many omissions. If the factory has appropriate reasons, but they are not listed, the factory cannot dismiss the worker. As a result, the factory can only support unnecessary workers or create unnecessary disputes over the right to dismiss. We believe that the principles of the work contract should be included in the Factory Law, but all detailed articles can be stipulated by the implementing rules or the order of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. According to Chinese custom, work belongs to the workers, which is the basis for the theory that retiring workers can have subsidies at the time of dismissal. This kind of subsidy can express sympathy and can also express the relationship between workers and work. In 1927, the Japanese Kawasaki Shipyard dismissed 3,000 workers and paid a total of 250,000 yuan in dismissal subsidies, or 83 yuan per person. In 1930, a certain factory in Shanghai suspended work due to a labor-capital dispute for about seven months. At that time, there were more than 1,000 workers. At the time of the suspension, the workers were given two months' wages (which was stipulated in the labor-capital agreement). In addition, each person was given a severance fee of 5 yuan. This kind of custom is unheard of in the West, but it is common in Far Eastern society. Therefore, Chinese workers are still willing to preserve the old custom, although the work contract has a notice of dismissal that can be as long as 30 days (and wages are paid and half of the notice period is given again). However, judging from Japan's experience, laws and customs can coexist without conflict, so we believe that the principles of the work contract may be stipulated in the Factory Law. Many employers believe that at the time when the labor movement policy is undecided, the notice is impossible. The result is that they cannot give notice and can only pay more wages to the dismissed workers. According to a report from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the total number of strikes in 1928 was 120, of which 24 (or 20 percent) occurred in the issue of employment and dismissal. The total number of strikes in 1929 was 111, of which 36 (or 32.4 percent) originated from employment and dismissal. From this, we can see the complexity of the dismissal issue. At the same time, workers believe that the factory often does not announce the reasons for dismissal and sends the dismissed workers out of the factory immediately after paying their wages, taking back their work permits and not allowing them to enter the factory again to avoid inciting unrest. This kind of method is inevitably close to high-pressure tactics. We understand the good intentions of the legislators. The purpose of the dismissal subsidy is to prevent dismissed workers from being economically oppressed when looking for a job, but the method seems cumbersome. The author believes that dismissed workers can be given notice 15 days in advance or be given wages equal to 15 days in lieu of notice. As for the work contract, only the principles are announced and no detailed articles are listed. If necessary, the articles will be included in the implementing rules or the order of the Ministry. (D) Apprentices: What is the difference between apprentices and child labor? Based on the answers in this survey, we cannot make a full analysis. In general, apprentices learn skills. The learning period is about three years or more. During the learning period, they are not paid and lose a part of their freedom. The age of apprentices is similar to that of child labor. Child labor has no learning period. They have wages after entering the factory, although the amount is very small. However, in several industries (such as machinery construction and weaving), some adult apprentices are no less skilled than ordinary workers, but they do not get wages or only get very small wages. This fact obviously exploits the wages of workers in the name of apprentices and should be stopped. The treatment of apprentices in some industries is harsh and similar to slavery and should be improved urgently. We believe that the apprentice chapter is an important part of the Factory Law and should be implemented immediately. However, the age of apprentices should be the same as that of child labor, both with 12 years old as the standard. (6) Safety and Hygiene: Safety and hygiene are important parts of the Factory Law, so our form also includes several questions. However, the answers obtained are generally vague and cannot be analyzed. One is because the articles are too few and seem empty, and the other is because the investigators filled them out unclearly, so we cannot adopt them. Many newly built factories have more suitable safety and hygiene equipment, but many old factories are sometimes transformed from houses and are very unsatisfactory. There are building regulations in the Public Concession, so ordinary factories have fewer architectural defects. The fire brigade has the right to investigate (although the legal power is not great), and the health inspectors can also help a little, so there are still ordinary standards. However, the situation outside the concession is very different from that inside the concession. Until recently, the authorities have gradually paid attention to hygiene and construction issues. Although the detailed situation of hygiene and safety cannot be discussed, it can also be described in general based on the author's visits. Dust in Chinese factories is a common and serious problem. Cleaning is rare except in large-scale and modern factories. Several labor unions have consulted with the factory to sweep or clean the floor once a week. However, the walls of the yarn factory and the beams of the cloth factory are only cleaned once a year in many places. Foreign factories are much cleaner. Many workers have to eat next to the machines, so the hindrance of dust and hygiene is self-evident. Washrooms and toilets are extremely incomplete. Some factories have no former at all, and the latter is poorly equipped. Open-minded employers have used new-style toilets, but workers privately bring cotton into them, causing the water pipes to be blocked. Although a person is used to guard the door, it is still ineffective. As a result, a certain yarn factory had to cancel the new-style toilets and restore the old-style toilets. The Factory Law and its implementing rules have not stipulated definite standards for safety and hygiene. Ordinary regulations are available, but there is still a lack of legal definitions. For example, Article 21 of the Implementing Rules stipulates that the construction of the factory shall be determined by a registered engineer's plan, but the planning must be submitted to the competent authority for approval. Not only that, but it does not mention whether the existing factory buildings are suitable at all. In addition, the implementing regulations stipulate periodic inspections of machines and boilers, but there is no legal definition. There are three proper regulations regarding fire prevention (which are still not enough). Regarding the manufacture of dangerous products, the location must be approved by the government. Regarding toxic gases and liquids, they must be filtered or decomposed and must not be arbitrarily distributed, which are also important articles. However, in addition, there are no practical regulations regarding toilet equipment, machine safety equipment (detailed regulations), air circulation, lighting, brushing walls, cleaning, fire prevention, etc. Hygiene and safety are one of the most important parts of the Factory Law. It seems that it should not be so brief. The factory laws of India and Japan have detailed regulations for safety and hygiene. Although the Hong Kong regulations are relatively simple, they are very practical. One thing that we can pay attention to is that there are no penalty clauses regarding safety and hygiene (although there are many regulations for penalties in this law). Indeed, according to the Factory Law, the hygiene and safety chapter is probably legally ineffective due to the lack of legal definitions. Based on the above reasons, we hope that the government will cooperate with hygiene, safety, and construction experts in the shortest possible time to formulate more practical articles so that they can be implemented immediately because the relationship between safety and hygiene and the Factory Law is very important.</p>

<h3>World Small Chronicles</h3>

<p>The World's Largest Apple Pie</p>
<p>Birmingham, England. Recently, an unprecedented large apple pie was made, enough for three thousand people to share and eat. Roughly speaking, this is the latest record in the history of pastry. The area of ​​the pie is 12 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 2 feet high. The materials required include 530 pounds of apples, 180 pounds of flour, 60 pounds of lard, and 28 pounds of sugar. All are British products, without using any foreign goods.</p>
<p>Chained Library</p>
<p>The chained library of Hereford Cathedral, one of the famous libraries in England, has recently undergone a thorough renovation and has reopened. Why is it called a chained library? Because the price of books was extremely expensive in the early days, and there were doubts about the readers' private morals, fearing that they would take the books away after reading them. Therefore, the 1,500 books displayed in the library are chained to the bookshelves one by one and cannot be taken away. There are several such chained libraries in England, but the scale is not as large as Hereford's. There are three within Manchester, two of which belong to the church and one to the school. The ages are extremely ancient, founded in the seventeenth century. In addition, Worcester Cathedral also has a library, founded in 1464. All the books in the library are not locked with chains, but are glued to the bookshelves and cannot be moved.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Record of Commander Gong and His Escape from Danger</h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>I heard from those returning from the front lines that the National Army, in its suppression of the Reds, treats all captured soldiers and officers with courtesy, but the Communists do not. Our captured officers are invariably subjected to the death penalty. Some months ago, Commander Gong Bingfan, while diligently suppressing the Reds in Jiangxi, found himself trapped in the bandit lair, yet managed to return safely. This was due to his extraordinary wisdom. When he was on the front lines and defeated, he failed to break through the encirclement. Realizing that dying in vain would not benefit the Party or the country, he quickly changed into the uniform of a common soldier, mingled with the troops, and was captured by the Communists. Once they arrived at the bandit lair, the Communists were certain that Commander Gong was among these dozens of defeated soldiers, but they did not know his identity. They announced to all the captives, "Whoever can point out Commander Gong will receive a great reward." Gong always treated his subordinates well and shared their hardships, so no one spoke. Although Gong had changed his clothes, there was a heroic spirit in his eyebrows and eyes, which made him appear different from the common soldiers. One bandit stepped forward, seized him, and said, "Are you not Gong Bingfan? Why are you mixing in like a commoner?" Gong calmly replied, "No, I am just a common soldier, so-and-so." His subordinates echoed, "He is indeed our comrade, so-and-so." The bandit could not decide and remained suspicious. The next day, the bandits announced to Gong and the others, "You have been deceived by those who wave the false flag of revolution. You are pitiful. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have a wife and children? Your families are eagerly waiting for you. Now, each of you will be given two taels of silver. Take them and go home quickly. You can make a living by farming." After speaking, a bandit brought out the silver, two taels for each person. When it came to Gong, he was given only half. Gong thought, "Everyone else gets two taels, but I only get one. What does this mean?" Seeing the bandits staring intently at him, he realized that they were testing his true identity. He stood up and said, "The journey home is long, and food and lodging are expensive. Two taels are not enough. Why are you treating me so poorly?" Hearing this, the bandits were certain that he was not Gong, so they gave him the other tael. Gong then left with his subordinates, crossing mountains and streams, and returned after a long journey. He reorganized his troops and devoted himself to the Party and the country. The reason the bandits gave Gong one tael of silver was that they believed anyone who was truly Gong would not care about the amount, as long as they could leave quickly. If he left, they would arrest him. Gong anticipated the bandits' intentions and turned the situation to his advantage. Therefore, his escape was due to his extraordinary wisdom.</p>
<h3>A Record of Ben Shan Tea</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zuyao</p>
<p>Mount Yu is not known for its tea, but it produces particularly good tea, unknown to most. In the past, I often visited Xingfu, Weixu, and other temples. The monks in the temples would always serve tea to guests. I drank it and found it sweet. When I asked its name, they said, "This is Ben Shan Tea." They said that brewing it with the spring water from Lian Zhu Cave makes it especially superior. I kept this in mind and never forgot it. Another day, I passed by Lian Zhu Cave, and it was raining. I rested at Da Tu An. The temple was long abandoned. In a corner of the room were a stove and a bowl. A monk was sitting there blowing on the fire, the sound whistling in harmony with the wind and rain. After a short while, the tea was ready. He presented it to me. I tasted it and believed it was indeed superior. I asked why it was different from the tea at other temples. He said, "The roasting is different, the water is different, and the fire is different. Therefore, the color, aroma, and taste are all different." I smiled and nodded, drinking several cups before leaving. I felt as if I could fly. From then on, I loved it as much as my own life. In the past, Wu Ciwei was a tea connoisseur who used six catties of charcoal, twenty-two liters of water, and two taels of tea every day. He particularly liked the Tian Zhong tea from Xuli. My preferences are similar. However, I have a feeling that since transportation has become convenient, guests who visit my Yu are constantly arriving. As a result, the mushrooms of spring and the chestnuts of autumn are all praised and taken away, their fame filling the world. Yet Ben Shan Tea is rarely mentioned. Is this the tea's good fortune or its misfortune? I am revealing it now to share it with fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>Strange News of a Cat Born with Wings</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Cats are animals that catch mice and climb walls. Their skills are already quite amazing. I have never heard of a cat growing wings. If a cat could grow wings and fly high, even the cleverest mice would have no survivors. There is a He family in my county, located in the eastern part of the county. A Li family lives there. The family keeps a cat. Its fur is deep black, clean, and shiny, no different from ordinary cats. However, its temperament is more clever. The owner loves it very much. The cat leaves in the morning and returns in the evening. The owner thinks it is like a person from Qi begging for food, so he does not investigate it. However, two months ago, the cat went out one morning and disappeared. Although they searched everywhere, there was no trace of it. The owner suspected that it had died in the wild or been eaten by other animals, and only regretted it. Unexpectedly, in recent days, someone discovered the cat appearing between the river waters. Two fleshy wings had grown under the cat's elbows. It flapped them on the water surface, catching fish and shrimp to eat. It seemed very happy. The owner heard about it and tried to catch it. However, it disappeared again in a short time. The cat has made the water its home and is no longer used to living on land. The person who told me said that the cat usually leaves in the morning and returns in the evening, catching fish and shrimp to eat. This has obviously not been a one-day occurrence. Living in the water for a long time and eating too much meat has caused these two fleshy wings to grow. The strangeness of the matter is quite puzzling. Recently, I heard that the owner is engaged in a second capture attempt. If he catches it, he plans to send it somewhere for display so that it can be studied by biologists. However, the cat is very cunning. It is not yet known whether the owner will be able to achieve his goal during this search period.</p>
<h3>Memories of Nobile's Arctic Expedition</h3>
<p>— Suxin</p>
<p>The Italian explorer Nobile, based on rumors circulating in the Russian capital that Amundsen, who went on an Arctic expedition in 1928 but did not return alive, is still alive in the Arctic, has joined forces with famous explorers from various countries. On July 18th, he set sail from the Russian port of Arkhangelsk on the Russian icebreaker Malygin to explore the Arctic. Various Western newspapers in Shanghai have been reporting on this matter. To help readers understand the origins of this event, I will briefly describe the tragic history of the Arctic expedition in 1928.</p>
<p>In April 1928, the explorer Nobile organized an Arctic expedition team and flew to the Arctic on the airship Italia. However, after they left, there was no news. Two weeks later, the Moscow Radio Station finally received a message for help from the team. The Soviet government ordered the organization of a rescue team and dispatched the icebreaker Malygin. On June 12th of that year, it set sail for the Arctic to rescue them. However, due to the difficulty of the work, the results were not satisfactory. The Russian government then sent the world's most robust icebreaker, Krasin, to assist.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in the Arctic, they searched back and forth in the icy wilderness for a long time, but to no avail. Finally, they used the three-engine airship they had brought with them to search. After a long time, they discovered the wreckage of the Italia in the "Seven Islands" area. They planned to fly back to the place where the Krasin was docked to report. Suddenly, they were blocked by heavy fog and had to land on the island. However, due to carelessness during landing, the fuselage was suddenly damaged. They urgently sent a radio signal for help. After learning of this, the Krasin opened at full speed and sailed into the ice sea that had not melted for tens of millions of years. Finally, it reached the destination and rescued Nobile, who was frozen and starving.</p>
<p>Then the Krasin sailed back to Norway. On the way, it encountered a German round-the-world cruise ship in distress, which was about to sink. The Krasin went to rescue them. The lives of the 1,600 passengers on board were safely rescued. After the Krasin safely arrived in Norway, it learned that Nobile's expedition team had split into three teams when in the Arctic. Amundsen and others were still trapped in the Arctic. On August 11th of the same year, it went to the Arctic again to search for the remaining people. After six weeks, there was no clue, so they had to return empty-handed. (It is said that the "Secret of the Arctic," which is currently being screened at the Paris Opera House, tells this story. I will wait to see it.)</p>
<h3>Indian Travel Notes (72)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>School No. 3 is closed, and the workers are on strike. Those painting for the New Year's Day holiday use colored water and red powder, either painting faces or splashing water on bodies, greeting each other. From this day onward, for three days, men paint men, women paint women, and mischievous children use water bottles or water guns to spray each other. Everyone is soaked. When people meet, they paint each other's faces once. If one meets ten or a hundred people in a day, one is painted countless times. Hair and beards all turn red and purple. The scene can be imagined. Clothes must be changed. One cannot wear new clothes. Sometimes one is as wet as a drowned chicken, and one's face looks like a blue ghost. They do this tirelessly, and everyone thinks it is fun. When Indians are painted with colors, Chinese people find it startling. However, their races are diverse, some black, some white, and some with red beards. According to the students, those who live in the north near the cloud mountains are white, and those who live in the south in the tropics are black. This is due to the climate. Historically, the European Aryans migrated west from India. They are originally of the same race as Europeans. Poor Indian women are difficult to compare with Chinese women in beauty. However, I would never dare to look down on them. Indian women are the mothers of Buddha. They can give birth to Buddhas.</p>
<p>The Indian people originally migrated south from the northwest. The boundary is between the Hui region and the Pamir Mountains. This is the province of Benjabu, that is, the place of Laha. Now the governor-general has moved from Jia City to Delhi, which is the southeast corner of Benjabu Province. It is located in the upper reaches of the Ganges River. The people are brave and fierce. It is at the forefront of the Hui region, so the governor-general moved there. According to Master Daojie, the Mughal Empire, built by the Yuan Dynasty in ancient times, also had its capital in Delhi. According to Indian history, in the Greek era, Alexander marched east to Benjabu Province, where he acquired Indian art and transmitted it to Greece. Also, the Persian King Darius conquered India. His troops all went east from Benjabu. Therefore, Benjabu Province is the gateway to the northwest. Indian history has been occupied by foreigners in successive dynasties, because it is immersed in religious philosophy, and the people are docile and kind, resulting in weakness. No people in the world have more conscience than Indians. The students told me that Indians are a nation of religious life. First, they talk about faith, then they talk about life. "We would rather die than change our faith." "We also know that Russian ideology is very good, but it opposes religion, so it is not suitable for India." I believe that the Jews of India are purely religious peoples, so their countries have all perished. European and American materialism is a materialism of the peoples. China is a nation of people's livelihood. India is a nation of human life or divine life. Material life and divine life are not the most suitable for people. A comparative study of who will hold the middle way of global culture in the future? Will it be our China? Although this is not the saying of the conservative old school, it is the saying of eclecticism, evolution, and renewal. Indians say that the history of their country is also unreliable because it has been annexed by various ethnic groups throughout history, such as Persians, Muslims, and British. Every time they invaded, they killed countless people. Today's historians dare not record in detail or recall to increase resentment, so history books are only on the surface. I told them that masculine mutual killing is not limited to different races. What about Huang Chao and Zhang Xianzhong in China? Are they different races? Where there is war in the world, there is killing. Indians do not need to recall every true history.</p>

<h3>Women, Women (7)</h3>
<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>"A good daughter-in-law! If you hadn't mentioned it, I would have forgotten. Let's do it this way! It will save Xiao Rong's father from being embarrassed. But Xiao Rong! You must remember that the money for your studies did not come easily!" His mother said. Xiao Rong was secretly happy, but on the surface, he had to pretend to be very grateful. In a moment, a pair of gold bracelets had already been taken out, and a gold hairpin and a pair of gold earrings had also been removed from his mother's head. In addition, there were fourteen snow-white silver dollars, all handed over to Xiao Rong. Eight eyes were staring intently. The emotions of each of the four people were extremely complicated. Xiao Rong was secretly calculating the value of these few pieces of gold and congratulating himself that the price of gold had soared in the past few days. The three items could be exchanged for at least one hundred and twenty silver dollars.</p>
<p>"Still short! Probably still short twenty silver dollars. What can we do?" Xiao Rong actually had an expression of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>His mother and wife became anxious. "Can we make do? You go pay with these first. We'll have to think of something later," they both said in unison.</p>
<p>"That won't work! Can Dad think of a way?" Xiao Rong's eyes were fixed on his father's face.</p>
<p>His father touched his money bag and didn't say a word, as if he was ashamed and anxious. Finally, he remembered that there were ten dollars under the mattress on the bed, so he had to take them out to make up the number.</p>
<p>From a solemn state, he held out ten silver dollars. His hand trembled, and he finally handed them to Xiao Rong. He said, "The rent for two months hasn't been paid yet. If they come to collect it, we'll have to stall them for a few days."</p>
<p>Xiao Rong also felt that he couldn't say anything more. The four people in the smoky room returned to a relatively happier state. Xiao Rong put the three pieces of gold in a package and stuffed it into his inner pocket. He also put the twenty-four silver dollars into his pocket. The clinking sound was heard by the shop assistant outside the room, who thought that Xiao Rong had made a fortune in Shanghai and returned.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the shop assistant walked in, showing a very envious look at Xiao Rong. On one side, he said, "Boss! The car is ready, and the horse is harnessed. Do you want to catch the express train at noon?"</p>
<p>"Okay! Let's go!" Xiao Rong's father stood up and looked at Xiao Rong, as if he had a lot to say but couldn't say it. Finally, he followed the shop assistant out together.</p>
<p>"Then, Dad, take me with you! I can still make it back to Shanghai!" Xiao Rong suddenly said. His father came back in.</p>
<p>"What? You're going back to Shanghai? Stay for even one day!" Xiao Rong's wife seemed a little disappointed.</p>

<h3>Spot Gold Shows Slight Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>Although the exchange rate loosened, it only fell one or two taels and six maces. Yesterday, August 1st, spot gold slightly weakened, with slight fluctuations, but without excessive changes, hovering around 740 taels. In the end, it fell one or two taels again. Dealers continued to sell. The silver market fell slightly, but people were calm. Therefore, the opening was soft. Afterwards, the exchange rate seemed to loosen. Banks were still willing to sell, causing the gold price to suddenly break through 40 taels. Near noon, buyers became slightly active, and it escaped the 40 taels barrier again. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday market closure, recalling the complicated situation in the middle of the week, it once surged to 50 taels, reaching 58.5 taels, and then suddenly fell to 36.5 taels, a reversal of 22 taels. Overall, it still fell 7 taels and 7 qian.</p>
<h3>August Futures Delivery Begins</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange began to deliver August futures, totaling about seven or eight thousand bars. Those delivering included Da Xing, Yong Chengfeng, Yong Yuanmao, Yong Da, and De Cheng, among others, with the most. Guang Bang Heng Xing only delivered about 300 bars. The rest were mostly several hundred bars. Those receiving included Tong Feng, Heng Da Feng, Heng Qian Changxiang, and others, totaling about 4,000 bars. In addition, Fu Chang, Run Chang, Yong Yingfeng Heng, and others each had four or five hundred bars. Those that have not been delivered will be settled at any time in the future.</p>
<h3>Big Silver Bar Report Contracts, Opening Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the opening price for September was reduced by four qian to 743 taels, followed by 2.2 qian. The large bars only contracted by one-sixteenth. The silver price contracted by one-eighth. The private telegrams were also the same. The European market was quite calm. Soon after, American stocks were small, and Zhi Feng, Yong Cui, Chang Yongshun, Li Yuanchun, and Wan Xing all advanced, rising more than one tael to 43.7 qian. In a moment, it was learned that HSBC sold 125 September British gold, and it was sold by Ri Chang, Yuanmao, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong, etc., so it fell by three taels, only 40.08 qian. After a while, it increased to 1.8 qian. When the order was announced not to change, it was 41 taels. Afterwards, Qian Changxiang, Ri Chang, Tian Feng Yong, and items hedging came to sell one after another, immediately breaking through 40 taels. At 9:50, it was 38 taels. Afterwards, Yong Heng Cheng Feng Yong Yuanheng, etc. all advanced, especially banks absorbing 1,875 October British gold and hedging 125 August, so the gold price rebounded, adding two or three taels, reaching 40.08 qian at 10:30. However, the selling positions were not quiet, and then depreciated by one tael again. At 11:00, it was 39.5 taels, followed by peace, only adding a few qian.</p>

September futures only opened two types of customs and reorganization. All other transactions were absent. The buying sentiment in the market was still strong, so the trend was peaceful and still strong. Among them, the 20-year customs tax continued to rise by 1.15, which was the largest increase.

<h3>Collapse of Yarn and Flower Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is extremely weak and experiencing a sharp decline, mainly because the overseas flower yarn situation is consistently trending downwards, and Japanese yarn is increasingly active. Raw cotton continues to fall, greatly impacting confidence. Scattered selling has led to panic, causing a sharp market downturn. Simultaneously, spot yarn traders, seeing the sharp decline in futures, are helpless. Consequently, transactions are exceptionally quiet, and confidence is waning. Major players show no intention of covering losses. Overall, the global cotton industry's slump is exerting significant pressure.</p>
<p>Manbiāo (Human Standard) Drops Two Taels　The exchange's manbiāo market opened weaker due to poor overseas cotton conditions. Prices fell by 1.479 taels. In the afternoon, Rongxing and Xinhua, two major long positions, closed out, causing the market to fall further, with monthly declines ranging from 7 to 14 qian. The total volume was 55,550 bales. Rongxing sold 2,900 bales, Mingde 1,150 bales, Gengfeng 1,100 bales, Yuda 1,600 bales, Xinhua 2,000 bales, and Shunda 1,050 bales. Daji bought 1,150 bales, Taixing 1,850 bales, Yiyu 1,100 bales, and Gengfeng 1,650 bales. The closing prices for manbiāo are recorded below:</p>

<p>October 1596 1895 550 January 1611</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Drops Two Taels　Spot yarn sales are sluggish. A total of 500 bales were bought by various trading groups throughout the day, according to statistics. Local merchants took in 350 bales, and prices fell back by two taels. Merchants from inland provinces took 110 bales, northern merchants 80 bales, Tianjin merchants 125 bales, Guangdong merchants 45 bales, Yunnan merchants 40 bales, and miscellaneous merchants 50 bales.</p>
<h3>Heavy Pressure on the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>U.S. Cotton Falls　Yarn Market Collapses　Manbiāo Cotton Wavering</p>
<p>Favorable Weather　Buyers Panic　A Fall of Six Qian</p>
<p>The cotton market is very weak and experiencing a sharp decline due to the global cotton market's downturn, causing extreme fear. The weather is favorable, and the yarn market is collapsing. Gold prices are stable, and Indian cotton is gaining dominance. Shenxin Company purchased 4,000 pieces of Indian cotton yesterday, causing significant market unease. Buyers are increasingly anxious. Japanese merchant Dongmian is also selling off large quantities of cotton, creating a difficult situation for the cotton market to recover from.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Sell Hanbiāo (Chinese Standard)　The exchange's Hanbiāo market opened weaker due to a sharp drop in U.S. cotton prices, causing further market unease. Long positions are closing out, and buyers are scarce. Prices fell by four qian. In the afternoon, Japanese merchants sold off, causing a further drop of 1.5 qian. The total volume was 151,800 dan. Jifeng sold 2,500 dan, Dafu 3,400 dan, Gengfeng 4,600 dan, Changfeng 5,500 dan, and Gongtai 5,900 dan, Rongxing 4,800 dan.

<h3>Sharp Decline in Foreign Yarn and Flower Yarn</h3>
<p>U.S. Cotton Estimates Favor Short Positions　U.S. cotton initially strengthened due to purchases by industry peers but weakened due to harvest estimates favoring short positions and selling in the West. Futures fell by 20 to 24 points, and spot prices fell by 25 points. British cotton futures rose 2-3 points, and spot prices rose 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 5 points. Indian cotton weakened due to unfavorable Liverpool news. Prices for Pingguoer, Aomula, and Bailuoxi all fell by one rupee. The original telegram is recorded below (dated July 31st):</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<h3>Pudong New Early Rice Arrives</h3>
<p>Market Opens at Sixteen Yuan, Total of Twelve Shi</p>
<p>Southern City　Yesterday, twelve shi of new early rice from Zhou Pudong arrived. Shenli Rice Mill bought it, opening the market at sixteen yuan. However, the supply of old stock remains scarce, and river transport is light. Retail sales in urban and rural shops are slow due to the limited arrival of new rice and the increase in foreign rice. The intention to buy is weak. The number of thick glutinous rice continues to tighten, and confidence seems to be weakening. The arrival and sales of thin rice are both rare. The taste is not dry. Sales are good on this street. Market prices are stable. The sales of foreign Du Jian's fresh materials and customers' rice are brisk, and prices are rising. Old rice is still stable. Stocks of variable negative yuan are scarce and slightly rising. Foreign rice customer groups continue to operate, but the situation of receiving goods is tight.</p>
<p>Xinzha　The rice market remains calm and stable. There were not many people coming to the market in the morning. The market price of top-quality thick glutinous rice was once called tight, and the opening price was slightly higher by one jiao. The arrival and sales of thin rice were normal with limited fluctuations. Foreign Lu Jian's fresh prices turned high, and the situation of old rice was light and stable. The taste of glutinous rice is good, and the shape is stable. Early rice is delivered and sold as it arrives, and the overall market is tight. The shape of early rice entering from inland areas on the 11th and 12th is lower by two or three jiao.</p>
<h3>Futures Flour Manufacturers Dump Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Amounting to Six or Seven Hundred Thousand Bags</p>
<p>Market Price Plummets by More Than Two Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market experienced a sharp decline. This change was seemingly prompted by the nervous reactions of merchants from the Yangtze River region. Ignoring overseas trends, they arbitrarily inflated prices, forcing producers to reserve foreign wheat for future adjustments. Yesterday, Fufu and smaller factories reserved foreign wheat. Western Australian high wheat was priced at 4.35 taels, Canadian No. 3 red wheat at 4.24 taels. Approximately three ships of U.S. No. 3 red wheat were even cheaper, priced at only 4.13 to 4.15 taels. As a result, a large number of futures were dumped. Factories released a total of six or seven hundred thousand bags. Even if external parties wanted to prevent further selling, they were unable to do so. Prices for all months fell sharply. The closing price for the July contract on the Chicago Board of Trade fell to 48 cents, indicating the severe oversupply overseas. It is inevitable that China will be affected. The August contract closed down 2.75 fen from the previous month, the September contract down 2.5 fen, the October and November contracts down 2.2 fen, and the December contract down 2.75 fen. The January contract opened at 1.65 fen but also fell 2.2 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>Foreign Wheat Suddenly Hits Lowest Record</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was weak. Chicago foreign wheat prices fell by one yuan, and outside wheat prices fell to 41 cents, a record low for foreign wheat. Canadian prices also fell by 4-5 jiao. Factories continued to reserve foreign wheat, making people feel weak. However, merchants from inland provinces reported that floodwaters in various places had receded, and confidence remained strong. Large long positions are supporting prices this month, requiring some time to recover. This month's price fell 3 fen compared to the previous day, the October price fell 3 fen, the November price fell 4 fen, and the December price fell 1 fen. Spot wheat prices were very stable due to limited arrivals. More than 3,000 bags of Shuangfeng, Penglai, Taicang, Kunshan, Wusong, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Hezhou wheat were taken away by Fuxin and Fufeng companies.</p>
<h3>Ten Plus Taels Increase of Si Cha Zhen Mei</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign tea firms in this port, Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other Lu Zhenmei green tea, Xiehe, Yihuo, Baochang, Yongxing and other firms, all started searching for them, and in view of the thin bottom on the market, they recognized the price slightly loose. China tea merchants were also firm because of the European sales launch. The market rose sharply by more than ten taels. Zhenmei, Xiumei, and other items were traded smoothly, and the market was extremely hard. Only the market of Gongxi had a stock of more than 20,000 boxes. The Russian firms had not yet opened, and the Bai Tou firms had no major sales.</p>
<h3>Pil Tou Changjiang (Yangtze River) Helps Selling Dong Pil</h3>
<p>Since the boycott of Japanese goods, the Eastern goods market of Piltou has not declined, and the inspection in this port is still in force, and the Yangtze River basin is still unobstructed, so the number of shipments exported in recent days has increased compared with the days before the anti-Japanese movement, and the price of goods has increased without falling. Yesterday, the price of Sijunzi Zhigong woolen fabric rose to Qingqingyun (lit. reaching to the clouds), and it has been opened at 3 qian and 2.5 fen. Qiuyan Moganshan sales were also not weak, and there was no place to search for Zhigong woolen fabric. The Hankou gang sold it at 4 qian and 2.5 fen. The celebrity woollen fabrics that had been set before have arrived in Shanghai one after another. In recent days, the Sichuan, Changsha, and Hankou gangs have been in great need, and the Sanmatou has sold it for 4 qian and 2 fen. Among the Biji, the Sanyou Hei is the most popular, and the stock in Shanghai has been sold out, selling for 3 qian, 3 fen and 7 li, which is mostly handled by the Han gang. The Xiaochuan gangs such as Wanxian and Chengdu have also shipped a lot, but this street is completely at a standstill for fear of detention, but the Piltou is a very scarce domestic product, and it is quite difficult to find a substitute for a while. The sluggishness of the machine-made cotton weaving industry is a great concern for the future of the boycott.</p>
<h3>Our Factory Camel Wool has Quite a Few Transactions</h3>
<p>A lot of domestic camel wool was sold yesterday, all of which were purchased by men's shops on this street. Printed fabrics were more popular than plain fabrics. Weilon, Tiger Pattern, Pioneer, Camel Brand, Shengda Dragon and Phoenix Pattern, and Tianxiang and other brands were all sold for 2 taels and 3.5 qian. Only the Double Deer Pattern and Hongfa, etc. were sold for 2 taels and 2.5 qian. Plain fabrics were 1 tael and 6 qian, and Tianxiang Weilon's Pioneers Shengda, etc. were 1 tael and 6.5 fen, most of which were custom-made and needed to be delivered within half a month.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Zhangzhou Branches Rise Six-Seven Liang</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 200 boxes of Zhangzhou lychee dried fruit from the Merchant Shipping Bureau Tunan ship arrived. The Lanting Zhishang brand was opened at 55-56 taels, followed by Wuye branch at about 45 taels, an increase of 6-7 taels compared to the previous market, and the market was firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse Sand White Factory Market Drops</h3>
<p>Taiche Ice Opened More Than 5,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telexed that Cuban raw sugar has not changed. New York sugar futures rose by three points each. Java spot sugar also did not fluctuate. The association's trading was sluggish. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was called 11 taels and 4 qian. No hands were received. No. 20 medium sand white was 10.095 to 9 qian. The process was also lax. Taikoo B was 11 taels and 9 qian, DY 11 taels and 7 qian, and HX 11 taels and 6 qian. Transactions were also rare, and the market was weak. More than 1,000 bags of ○○ car ice were sold, that is, the prices for loading goods and September and October were both 9 taels and 1 qian. Although the new regulations and taxes were not smooth, the market was about to run out, and it was still firm. The number of transactions was also quiet, and the number of thrown goods and Dutch sugar inquiries was also sparse. The new crude sand white was loose at 5 yuan and 9 jiao, and the old goods were 5 yuan and 8 jiao. Although there were slight transactions, the market was also weak, and there was a trend of getting worse and worse.</p>
<h3>Hardware Company Iron Sales Very Strong</h3>
<p>Market Overview　Yesterday, hardware transactions were adorned by Fujian Shantou, Sichuan Yantai, Qingdao, and the Yangtze River gangs. The price of each cargo reached four or five thousand dan. Although the price of goods did not rise temporarily, it was much better than before.</p>
<p>Hardware Company Iron Demand Exceeds Supply　Yesterday, cigarette factory gangs rushed to handle, and the market was surprisingly good. The standard was raised by a few cents. The American goods were estimated at 30 taels and 5 cents, and the British goods No. 1 were sold at 29 taels and 2.5 qian. No. 2 was estimated at 28 taels and No. 3 at 27 taels. Check that the American goods and No. 1 British goods are in short supply, so the market is better. British goods Nos. 2 and 3 are widely stocked and tend to be peaceful, with little progress.</p>
<p>French Western Nails Are Moving　French Western Nails transactions were rarely affected by Eastern goods, and the market was sluggish. Before yesterday, because of the boycott relationship, each gang changed to Western goods, and the transactions were booming, and the plan was estimated at 9 taels per barrel. It is estimated that more than 2,000 barrels have been completed in the past two days, and those who sold it are all Tieh's on Suzhou Road.</p>
<p>More Than 1,000 Dan of Black Iron Sheet Arrived Yesterday　The green in the black iron market has not yet arrived, so it is very cold, but the bottom is thin, and the human mind is consolidated, and the standard can still be supported without falling. There was another 1,300 dan of spot goods in Pudong yesterday, so there is no worry of interception in January and February.</p>
