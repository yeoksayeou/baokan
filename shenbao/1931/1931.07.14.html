<p>上海市試騐小學課程暫行標準結果報告</p>
<h3>國語科</h3>
<p>丨敎學時間丨</p>
<p>（一）小學各年級國語科每週敎學時間丶似嫌太少丶應酌量增加「理由」照暫行標準規定各年級國語科時間敎學丶至課程結束時丶每多未能達到丶最低限度丶</p>
<p>丨作業要項丨</p>
<p>（一）國語科三四年級寫字項内簡便行書的學寫應删去丶「理由」一·三四年級兒童正書尚未寫好丶若再練習行書丶恐正書進步更少丶二·三四年級兒童對於正書字觀念丶尚有未十分清楚者丶若再學寫行書丶對於正書的寫法正確度必减低丶（五年級兒童學寫行書後丶寫的錯字丶比未學行書時爲多丶五年兒童尚然丶何况三四年級兒童丶）</p>
<p>（二）行書的學寫也似以移在五六年較爲妥當丶</p>
<p>（三）一·小學國語第三各學年作業要項丶各學生寫字所注意的丶只有字體的種類丶依各敎師們的意思丶除注意字體的種類以外丶還該注意寫字用的筆寫字用的筆丶大别之有二丶</p>
<p>一·軟筆丶二·硬筆軟筆所指的是毛筆丶硬筆所指的是鋼筆鉛筆等丶普通小學裏往往以爲正式寫字丶只指應用軟筆學習丶而講的這是一向習慣的緣故小學裏所以要有寫字丶不用說是因爲一個人在社會上生活丶有具寫字技能的必要丶在從前社會上所需要的丶是軟筆字丶（就是毛筆字可是現在社會上所需要的丶是軟筆字而變爲鋼筆字了丶如果在現在時候丶學習寫字丶仍和從前一樣丶只用軟筆不用硬筆實是一個大大的錯誤丶在小學國語各年級寫字丶正書行中字小字的學習丶雖然没有明白　限定用那一種軟筆硬筆丶可以自由支配丶但爲預防誤會丶格外清楚起見丶應把寫字用的筆也標出來丶各年級寫字要項丶如把寫字用的筆也標出來丶則可修改如下丶</p>
<p>一·第一二年級丶一原文「布告標識的書寫」丶可改爲布告標識軟筆或硬筆的書寫二原文丶「簡易熟字書寫的練習」可改爲簡易熟字軟筆或硬筆的書寫練習三原文「其他寫字的設計練習」可改爲其他軟筆或硬筆寛字的設計練習丶</p>
<p>二·第三四年級丶一原文「布告標識書信柬帖等書寫一丶可改爲佈告標識書信柬帖等軟筆或硬筆的書寫丶二原文「正書中小字習寛」丶可改爲正書中字軟筆的習寫與正書小字軟筆或硬筆的習寫丶三原文「簡便行書的學寫」丶可改爲簡便行書軟筆或硬筆的學寫丶</p>
<p>三·第五六年級丶一原文「實用文的書寫」丶可改爲實用文軟筆或硬筆書寫丶二原文與第三四年級二相同丶所以修改也可一樣丶三原文「簡便行書中小字習寫」丶可改爲簡便行書中字軟筆的習寫與簡便行書小字軟筆或硬筆的習寫丶總之在「習寫」「學寫」等字上面丶都該加上「軟筆」或「硬筆」這幾個字丶不然也應於附註裏面註明丶</p>
<p>（四）俗體破體帖體字認識丶似宜移在五六年丶以三四年兒童對於字的認識丶尚未能十分正確丶宜單純不宜複雜丶</p>
<p>（五）國語科讀書丶第一二學年作業要項中丶應加注音符號的認識丶「理由」注音符號爲帮助認識漢字的重要工具丶依據實際情形丶一二年級兒童巳能認識</p>
<p>丨低限度丨</p>
<p>（一）初級　低限度應减去能寫行書丶</p>
<h3>黨義科</h3>
<p>（一）低年級之黨義一科丶可與社會自然合稱「常識科丶「理由」查總說明内容丶甲·項根據三民主義加入關於三民主義化之敎材一語丶包含甚廣丶如其再把黨義獨立一科丶作有系統之研究丶那麽距離兒童的强騐丶未免過遠丶如其根據兒童的需要丶選擇敎材丶那麽與其他科目又要衝突了丶</p>
<h3>社會科</h3>
<p>丨作業要項丨</p>
<p>（一）社會科高級作業要項中應加職業指導一項丶「理由」依據實在情形小學畢業生升學者少丶就業者多丶故當施以職業指導丶俾作就業之準備丶</p>
<p>丨最低限度丨</p>
<p>（一）在暫行課程標準裏說「本標準除黨義一種由中央黨部訓練部主持外丶其餘的都是由敎育部中小學課程標準起草委員會丶請託各專家分科擬定彚集整理」丶照這樣看起來丶黨義是自成一科丶與社會科處於平等的地位丶並不包含在社會科之内丶</p>
<p>小學社會第五最低限度丶（一）初級結束裏有「（四）……并行使四權的方法要點丶（五）了解五權四權的要點」等丶依各敎師的意思丶這些材料丶都可放入到黨義裏去丶不要雜入到社會科裏來丶嚴格講起來丶黨義本是社會科裏的一種丶不過現在是以三民主義來建設國家的丶三民　主義比任何學科都重要丶因爲他重要丶所以應該從社會科裡分離出來丶自成一科丶特别研究丶黨義旣然從社會科分離出來丶自成一科丶特别研究丶則凡屬黨義裡東西丶似當劃入黨義範圍裡去丶以免混雜和重複</p>
<p>高級畢業應添列一條「明瞭世界各國的大勢和中國在世界的地位」</p>
<h3>算術科</h3>
<p>丨作業要項丨</p>
<p>（一）算術一科丶無論筆算和珠算丶非有長時間繼續不斷的練習丶難能達到技能的嫻熟丶思想的敏捷丶查作業要項内丶每週時間中高年級實際上還嫌太少丶</p>
<p>（二）一二學年的算術要項丶第二日星期月年的認識丶除星期一項外丶其餘各項至少應調至第六項十到十九數目的認識項下丶因爲日月年方面丶取用以表示的數目丶常大於一到九的數目丶</p>
<p>（三）第三四學作業要項中丶應加簡單簿記丶（個人和家庭的練習）「理由」使兒童明瞭帳簿的使用和記載方法丶</p>
<p>（四）關於算術科方面的丶（一）方寸方尺立方寸立方尺等名稱的意義丶在兒童們是很不容易懂得的丶照各敎師們意思丶小學算術第三各學年作業要項丶關於平方方面的敎材丶由一二年級移到三四年級裏來丶關於立方方面的敎材丶由三四年級移到五六年級裏來丶</p>
<p>丨敎學方法要點丨</p>
<p>（一）珠算與筆算聯絡了敎不如分開了敎丶「理由」（一）學算盤比學筆算難丶（二）同時學習珠算課桌地位不便丶（三）同時學習珠算筆算敎師不易發現兒童的錯誤丶</p>
<h3>七作料</h3>
<p>丨作業類别丨</p>
<p>小學工作第二作業類别丶分爲（一）校事丶（二）家事丶（三）農事丶（四）工藝丶（五）商情丶農工商學丶無所不包丶以内容講可謂完備極了丶以範圍講丶可謂廣大極了丶但要聘請一位能夠擔任内容這樣廣大的功課的敎師丶真不容易丶如果分開担任丶則小學裏功課丶比從前更爲散漫丶與編訂課程標準的原意大相違背丶</p>
<p>丨工作科的困難問題丨</p>
<p>工作科内家庭間操作成績丶很不容易調查丶即調查所得丶亦難確實丶烹飪實習丶因學生衆多丶用具不敷分配丶因之秩序方面丶很難維持丶又畜養和農作物丶因限於校地丶不易實行丶</p>
<h3>自然科</h3>
<p>丨最低限度丨</p>
<p>（一）小學自然第五最低限度丶（一）初級結束裏丶「（二）明了所習用的衣食住行各種生活物品的功用的大要」所習用的衣食住行各種生活物品很多很多丶初級結束最低限度丶要把牠們統通都明瞭丶似乎程度大點丶依照各敎師們的意見丶這一條可參照丶一（三）有八種以上很好的衛生習慣」的辦法丶限以種數比較妥當些丶</p>
<p>（二）小學自然第五最低限度丶（二）高級畢業共計七條丶七條當中丶關於自然的丶只有（一）（二）兩條丶關於衛生的丶有（三）（四）（五）（六）（七）五條丶在形式上丶似乎太偏重衛生一點丶照各敎師們的意思丶自然方面丶不妨再加進一條明了丶所習用的衣食住行各種生活物品功用的大要丶參照良好衛生習慣的辦法種數丶比初級結束時加多丶</p>
<h3>音樂科</h3>
<p>丨作業要項丨</p>
<p>（一）第一二學年在練習項内丶宜參酌增添「音樂初步閃爍片」的辨認丶因第一二學年的學生唱歌根本不採用樂譜丶但至少須對於樂譜有初步的認職丶以便三四學年時丶作視唱的準備丶至該項閃爍片丶由敎師自製例如正面書丨反面寫四分音符等丶</p>
<p>丨關於音樂者有三點丨</p>
<p>（二）工尺譜之讀法和板眼丶可改至第五學年起丶與本國樂器演奏聯絡敎學第三四學年的兒童丶正在開始練習識正譜的時候丶實在没有精力和時間去研究工尺譜了丶若改至第五學年去研究丶可以和國樂演奏聯絡起來丶一方使兒童覺得需要學習丶一方使兒童有應用和練習的機會丶</p>
<p>（三）二部輪唱曲的時候丶可以提早二部輪唱曲練習丶不是一件難事丶儘可以提早丶在三四學年開始練習丶以增加兒童對於音樂的興味無疑的兒童們丶聽到這裏新奇的唱法和美麗的和聲丶會不可思議的興奮起來丶</p>
<p>（四）本國樂器的奏演丶應規在五六學年作業要項的練習欄内丶本國樂器演奏確是一件小學生所應該練習的事項丶就是該標準所規定最低限度最高的畢業標準内丶也明明寫着能應用本國樂器二種以上丶獨在作業要項内一句丶也没有提起丶最好要補入丶</p>
<h3>體育科</h3>
<p>丨作業類别丨</p>
<p>課外運動丶最好不在午刻舉行丶因距離午飯時間太近丶於衛生上不大相宜丶</p>
<p>丨各學年作業要項丨</p>
<p>三四學年運動一項丶旣有簡單的球類運動丶那末簡單的田徑運動丶當然也可列入丶</p>
<p>丨敎學方法要點丨</p>
<p>一丶選手運動會項目表内往賽距離丶沿用碼制丶查世界遠東全國大學中學運動會中皆巳改爲米制丶爲啣接一貫起見丶碼有改爲米之必要丶二丶低欄應定一百十米丶查上海全巿小學聯合運動會實騐下來丶尚屬適用丶惟乙組似應取消丶</p>
<h3>科目合併</h3>
<p>一丶音樂與體育丶二丶工藝與美術丶三丶個人衛生與公共衛生丶</p>
<p>（一）低年級之音樂體育丶可合併爲「唱遊」丶以低年級音樂體育丶分别兩科丶敎學時太少興趣丶並嫌呆板丶合諸小學科目丶不宜繁多之原則丶似乎也有合併之必要丶</p>
<p>（二）低年組工藝與美術合併敎學丶較爲便利丶「理由」關於低年組工藝科爲顧及製作上便利起見丶必先明瞭形象的觀念丶一方面易於引起研究美術之興趣丶一方面即可施諸應用從事製作丶雙方聯絡丶興趣較爲濃厚似以合併敎學爲便利丶</p>
<p>（三）個人衛生與公衆衛生丶似宜合併敎學丶較爲便利丶</p>
<p>「理由」一丶本標準個人衛生一項丶屬諸自然科丶公衆衛生屬諸社會科丶自試騐以來丶覺個人衛生與公衆衛生丶處處相關丶分開敎學丶頗多不便丶一二丶我國人民對於衛生丶素所忽視丶初等敎學每對於衛生項智識及習慣應竭力設法灌輸及培養丶現在把他分併自然社會兩科敎學丶不免有所偏廢丶究非注重衛生之道丶</p>
<p>「辦法」一丶社會科内公共衛生丶併入自然科内丶衛生智能項下丶敎學合地理歷史丶稱爲社會科丶合自然現象生活需要衛生智能（公共衛生個人衛生）稱爲自然科丶時間分量丶改爲</p>
<p>自然低級一百二十分丶中級一百五十分丶高級一百八十分丶</p>
<p>社會低級六十分丶中級九十分丶高級一百五十分丶</p>
<p>二丶將社會科内的公共衛生和自然科内的個人衛生丶提出合併丶稱爲衛生丶特設一科丶各年級每週敎學時間丶定六十分丶（完）</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>火車上的學堂</p>
<p>坎那大政府。對於兒童敎育。異常注意。他們以爲兒童們要是不能上學堂去。那麽學堂就該去遷就他們。移樽就敎。他們抱定了這個宗旨。便毅然决然的實行其事。在恩太利哇Ontario省好幾處地方的人民。大半是以採木爲營生的。他們帶着家屬。往來採木。决不能久居在一個地方。因此他們的子弟。也决不能投入尋常的學堂中去讀書。敎育當局異想天開。特地利用火車作爲學堂。在車中裝了書案和座位。像課堂一般模樣。就在六百英里長的鐵路上往來行駛。一路招集兒童們上車讀書。雖因區域廣大。時間有限。每一個兒童。决不能天天上學。但是多少也受了一些相當的敎育。</p>
<p>全世界最清潔的都巿</p>
<p>世界中無論那一國那一個大都會。街道和公共場所。總不免見到不整潔的現象。雖然巿政當局對於垃圾的取締十分嚴厲但是仍有許多人喜歡將作廢的電車票公共汽車票。烟尾。和空烟匣等。隨手抛棄。即如倫敦的當局。雖屢思取締。而終於無可如何。但是全世界却有一個地方。竟能辦到這件事。那就是澳洲新南威爾士的昔特奈。Sydney先由地方當局布告全城。凡有人自某月某日起。破壞街道中的清潔而任是將一張電車票抛棄在街中的。一律拘拿罰金不貸。從此以後。巿民就不知不覺的清潔起來。西特奈竟成了全世界最清潔的都巿。</p>
<h3>誌湖南醴陵之紅拂墓</h3>
<p>— 天恨</p>
<p>愚好聆人談古蹟。有以歷史上有名古蹟饗愚者。輒不禁紳往而忘倦。每值異地良朋。亦必嬲其談彼鄉古蹟以爲快。積生平所聞。何止十百數。惜乎勞人草草。無力作汗漫遊。遂至有百聞而無一見。徒縈夢想耳。最近識一湘友。告愚曰。隋美人紅拂埋香何許。世人知之者綦尠。今以告君。其墓在湖南醴陵縣隔江西山之麓也。七八年前。即湘人亦多不之知。淪於草萊。幸殘碑猶在。未至滅跡。當趙恒惕主湘時代。第二師劉鉶部之葉琪旅。駐防其地。旅部有參謀何某。風雅士也。一日。閒遊至西山。見殘碑臥地。摩挲字跡。識爲紅拂埋香之所。遂聯合地方紳耆。捐貲修葺。旣成樹豐碑於墓前。鐫曰紅拂之墓。墓側建有一亭。何某自撰聯曰。紅拂有知應識我。青山何幸此理香。又以墓前山勢陡斜。步履不便。特開闢寛坦大道。兩旁遍植桃柳。以爲點綴。自此遂爲遊屐雜沓之所。紅拂芳名。頓膾炙於醴陵人士之口。不减於吳會之真娘。錢塘之蘇小小。雖曰青山有幸。母亦紅拂之幸。地下有知。應感何參謀者也愚按。紅拂本隋相楊素之侍妓。姓張名出塵。李靖以布衣謁素。姬妾羅列。中有執紅拂者。有殊色。獨目靖。其夜靖歸逆旅。紅拂奔之。曰。妾楊家紅拂妓也。絲羅願托喬木乃與俱適太原。至其墓何以在醴陵。則友謂湘人相傳。紅拂隨李靖出征。軍次醴陵。以病而殁。遂瘞之西山之麓。真僞殊不可考。然而真娘蘇小。又何嘗可考。即近如有清之香妃墓。不足二百年。便巳聚訟紛紜。莫能確定其孰真孰僞。而况紅拂。又何必膠柱鼓瑟爲哉。</p>
<h3>和胡展堂先生楚騷三百不相師原韻一律</h3>
<p>— 袁希洛</p>
<p>人工每不善天師。妙手文章信口詩。蝶夢醒來周亦幻。螬餘嚥去仲何痴。風雲纈眼三千刦。星宿羅胸十二時。蠹盡書城方一語。簡編敢侈在心期。</p>
<h3>虞洽卿君旅滬五十週紀念贈詩四首</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>余亦圖南卡五年。倒將數字便天淵。可知世界成名者。第一人天結壽緣。</p>
<p>白門刦約百年奇。黄禍纔驚醒睡獅。指日造成新上海。與君奮鬭到期頣。</p>
<p>不官不隱亦非商。非富非貧不冕王。願與邦人創榮典。贈君一等自由章。（贈送自由。歐洲以爲曠典。客夏英麥相受此禮。）</p>
<p>三北經營自治區。多年心力好規模。金堤夜聽風濤宿。薄宦鴻踪記海隅。</p>
<h3>新青蓮閣小記</h3>
<p>— 王沿津</p>
<p>青蓮閣三字。滬濱婦孺。幾無不知之者。自新遷往神仙世界對門後。力事整頓。面目煥然一新。今日之雅潔。逈非曩昔之卑陋可比。一昨爲彌月之期。經理孫紹瑞君。邀請報界。聲明改革表蓮閣之性質。藉使騷人墨客。知所問津焉。</p>
<p>主人口中之今昔　孫君略謂當初所設青蓮閣於四馬路時。爲下流人　玩之所。青年工人。墮落於此者。不可勝數。我咎實難辭。因籌改革之方。然困於環境。一時難以實現。今此處新屋落成。乃即遷移而來。營業性質。與前此不同。設備亦殊。二樓爲普通書塲。及各業販賣接洽處。三層則特設雅座。專爲騷人墨客論文之地。</p>
<p>日報記者之失望　上海每日新聞記者堤一郎。及菅藤春庭兩君。是夕亦準時列席。兩記者以爲今日來此。得一啖中國菜矣。不意孫君因三樓特設日本料理部。今日特以日本料理饗客。兩記者大失所望。然我國報界中人得嘗異邦風味。非常歡忭云。</p>
<p>日本料理之創設　日本料理。其中亦不乏佳味。今國人之嗜東味者日衆。然皆須往虹口日本料理店。取價甚昻。國人苦之。孫君有鑒於斯。特闢該部。在上海實爲創設。取價甚廉。所以挽回利權。且招待日本新聞記者。力事宣傳。俾木屐兒亦彚集於此。則其用意更深長矣。</p>
<p>劇堪人憐之招待　三樓之特别雅座。有女招待焉。中有能日語者。孫君囑予試騐其程度若何。予詳詢之。知彼姝年方二八。其父曩嘗經商於日本横濱。任中國志成會會長。一時頗有聲譽。不幸中道溘逝。伊乃飄零回國。竟流落爲女招待。當其父在時。門下多清客奴僕。故伊所操日語。皆係對下屬之言語。而非敬語。然操此生涯。非用最敬語不可。噫世道不可憑。今日之乞食者流。寗非曩昔之車馬盈門者乎。感慨所至。不能無言。因並誌之。</p>
<h3>絲襪瑣談</h3>
<p>— 秉蘭</p>
<p>衣·食·住·人生不可缺一。襪爲日用必需之品。亦居重要地位。我國古時。以土布製造。謂之杜布襪。間亦有以荷蘭標布製者。謂之洋布襪。繼有香港線襪輸入。謂之洋線襪此襪大小。適合足度。故人人樂用。到處風行。而舊式布襪。漸成淘汰。近年以來。物質進化。科學昌明。遂有用電力機織造絲襪者。考電力機在歐西。巳有十餘年之歷史。在我國猶屬初見。當時購置者。雖有十餘家。然新式機械。尚屬創見。難免技術不精。人才缺乏。於是曇花一現。漸歸消滅。碩果僅存者。不過南洋襪廠等數家耳。南洋爲粤人所創辦。粤人素以善經營稱於時。以故成績最優。出品亦精。各省及國外。均有推銷。業營日見發達。且該廠主任余穉敬君。富有針織學識。曾留學德國。最近發明之小方跟。跳舞女絲襪。及三百廿針男絲襪。尤爲特色。聞余君言。此種小方跟絲襪。在歐美巳屬盛行。在我國則尤屬初步。今結果頗佳。國貨前途。甚抱樂觀也。</p>
<p>更正　昨日虞洽卿先生紀念會一文。内第十四行此佳之「佳」字。與第十七行次趣之「次」字。應對掉。第二十二行「淡如」二字。係「澹涵」之誤。又世界小事記第二節題目。「犯罪」應改作「罪犯」。</p>
<h3>游韓漫談（四）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>朝鮮人受日本的政治侵略與經濟侵略。巳經慘痛萬狀了。此外文化侵略。更是朝鮮人的致命傷。日本併吞朝鮮。不過二十餘年。在三十歲以内的朝鮮人。無論男女。失學的固然很可憐。即有機會讀書。其所學乃奴隸敎育。說來更是可憐。三十歲以上没有受過奴隸敎育的人。多數還能自覺。以爲這班後生小子。完全歸化於日本。着實是極危險的事。然而這班後生小子。能明瞭其中利害的。不知還有幾人。</p>
<p>我在漢城時。曾調查過朝鮮的敎育概况。漢城方面。有帝國大學丶法學丶醫學丶商業丶工業丶四專門學校。中等學校十五所。小學校百餘所。多數是日人辦的。當然施行他們特殊的敎育方針。間有韓人自巳設立的學校。但須一律依照總督府學務局所頒佈的學制。功課以日文爲主體。朝鮮本國的文字。語言。歷史等。限制得很嚴。所以現在一般青年學生。講起來一口日本話。寫起來一筆日本文。他們反以爲用韓文丶韓語是落。伍。不及那樣的時髦呢。</p>
<p>漢城丶平壤兩處還有一種特殊的學校。比美國乞丐學校更來得新奇的。即是所謂妓生學校。宗旨在養成一般優秀的歌妓。課程注重音樂丶歌舞丶交際丶裝飾等學。規定四年畢業。那兩個學校學生都很發達。畢業生在娼妓界佔有很大的勢力。日本人所以創辦那種學校。一方面迎合社會人士的心理。同時也是對付朝鮮的政策之一。他們想把這種敎育推廣了。使一般人都近於女色。麻醉青年。分化韓人奮發進取的精神。其用心的尖刻。可以想見。友人某君曾告訴我說。「四五年前。韓國曾起過一次獨立的運動。各處民衆。都有激烈的表示。平壤妓生學校學生。也參加示威游行。」她們也知道爭國家的自由。比現在多數醉生夢死的青年。光榮得多呢。</p>

<h3>？？？（二一）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良那裏肯吃？自巳頭不痛，爲什麽去吃頭痛藥？斷没有這種道理。所以他默默無語，動也不動，夫人也覺得他吃不得必須救他一救：</p>
<p>「你此刻不吃，到晚上吃也好！」</p>
<p>「這藥，治月經痛也很靈！」</p>
<p>葉女士向夫人說着。内科的藥，轉移到女科去了。子良覺得：把我的頭，與月經歸入一類，未免太失禮了。</p>
<p>說話告一叚落，葉女士把話頭轉換一個方向：</p>
<p>「一年不到上海，情形大不相同了，潘先生！小考而夫，你會不會？可以領我到什麽地方去學一學麽？我覺得再不學會這一個玩意兒，我一定要落伍了。」</p>
<p>「實不相瞞，我是不會的。」</p>
<p>子良謙虚似的回答着，夫人便過來揷嘴：</p>
<p>「那種外國玩意，没有什麽意思，不過一時時髦罷了。我主張提倡國貨，今天你難得到此，我們來叉麻雀罷！」</p>
<p>子良着急得不得了，一叉麻雀，不但今天鬧得不能工作，說不定還要拖人下水，所以非竭力破壞不可：</p>
<p>「不行！人不夠啊！」</p>
<p>「我們這裏，有了三個人，去呌隔壁蔣二奶奶來，就成了。」</p>
<p>夫人如此提議，子良暗想：我果然逃不了，而且再要去邀隔壁的蔣二奶奶來。蔣二奶奶丶年紀難有四十多歲，喉嚨比小達子還響，這三位女太太并在一起，我連今天晚上也可以睡不着了，决計使不得，還是造一個謡言罷：</p>
<p>「蔣二奶奶今天朝晨到閔行去了。」</p>

<p>昨日雖值週初丶照往前繁忙時候丶形勢頗爲旺盛丶毋如目下夏令丶商業各均例淡丶毫無生動活躍氣概丶金融界尤以各業之閑散而特過之丶是故昨日雖爲星期一丶而屏氣消聲丶　然無所勁勢可言丶對於各種價格丶因而亦在疲平之中丶且銀行方面丶收解消息亦屬寥落丶就此可知巿面之岑寂焉丶</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>李步蘭的回憶錄</h3>
<p>— 椿</p>
<p>本來文人每多戀愛的故事、梅特林（Macter　linck）也是一個不能例外的、當一個素不識面的女子爲了讀了他的作品而傾慕而向他流露愛情、而在他到也正在需要這些的時候、有此奇遇、遂不由的領受了、但那裏知道、在結婚同居了二十年後、今因種種不幸而離異、各各抱着創傷的心、各走各的路、在梅特林當初或者僅是當時一時的感動、但在那個女性方面、豈能料想到會有今日的一幕戲劇、這主人翁是誰、便是李步蘭（GeorgetteLeblanc)、</p>
<p>李步蘭以讀了梅特林的名著Princesse　Moleine和Pellease　et　Melisande)、於是大受感動、在心靈上留下了深刻的感應、以爲自巳所理想的人物適巧像該二書中所描寫的人物的性格和所處民地位的一切、於是不覺幻想了、結果是大胆的向梅特林表示愛情、並且就嫁了他、這段姻緣、在任何人看來、一定是認爲美滿的吧、在當時、文藝界爭傳此事、不知羡煞了多少人、可是畢竟樂極生悲、理想中的梅特林、和嫁後的梅特林、是相差得多多啊、最後終至抛棄了二十年同居生活、協議離異了、</p>
<p>最近李步蘭不識是何用意、竟著了一書、筆調風格甚似回憶錄式、赤裸裸的把那一段文字姻緣相結合的一回事描寫出來、但文字頗沉着莊嚴、不露一些輕浮、即怨恨之辭亦不輕露、雖字裏行間、不免時時泛溢着她出嫁後對梅特林的印象與嫁前的夢想是如何的不同、描寫甚爲細膩、風格則一如其人、不知梅林特林讀之當作若何感想、刻下此書頗引起歐美文壇的注意、</p>
<h3>東方學報</h3>
<p>— 椿</p>
<p>東京第一册</p>
<p>自東方文化學院京都研究所的「東方學報京都第一册」出版後、頗引起一般人的注意、日人此種精詳的研究、假探討學術爲名、當不無叵測之心、然其精神則誠值得我們的佩服、他何絲毫不在虚浮的地方下功夫、而不畏艱難地在實際分　中國的社會、政治、經濟、文化、地理、歷史、更着重在中國歷史的回溯、反觀自巳國内、反形缺如、能不愧慚、無巳、東方文化學院的組織、因在中國的活動較著、故知道的人巳很多、</p>
<p>這裏東京研究所便是其中的支系、研究各别隷屬則一、此東京第一册與京都第一册的内容、大致相似、一切體裁題名、悉與京都册同、係由東京研究所主任服部宇之吉博士總主、現在把研究員十七人的研究專題錄在下面、以見其研究工程的一般、</p>
<p>支那建築裝飾——伊東忠太、</p>
<p>支那古代貨幣之史的化學的研究——加籐繁、道野鶴松、</p>
<p>楚辭文學的研究——古城貞吉、</p>
<p>支那歷代帝王陸研究——吳野貞竹島卓一、</p>
<p>滿蒙有史以前及遼代契丹人的文化—烏居龍藏、</p>
<p>儀禮鄭德補正——服部宇之吉、</p>
<p>唐令之復舊及其史的研究——仁井田陞、</p>
<p>唯識學之系統的研究——結城令聞</p>
<p>古代中央亞細亞底藝術（尤注重繪畫部份）——松本榮一三才笹吉、</p>
<p>支那家族制度的研究（尤注重於承繼制度爲中心部份）——牧野巽、</p>
<p>讀史方輿紀要地名索引底編纂——青山定男、</p>
<p>類聚支那古器圖底編纂——原田淑人駒井和愛、</p>
<p>至於本册收集的有下列各篇目、</p>
<p>以成惟識論爲中心的唐代諸阿賴識論——結城令聞、</p>
<p>故唐律疏議製作年代考（上）——仁井田陞牧野巽、</p>
<p>古代支那的化學思想（元素思想）——道野鶴社、</p>
<p>山東省黄龍縣口附近之貝塜——駒井和愛、</p>
<p>從文化史觀察古代的楚國——小抑司氣太、</p>
<p>未附彚報、歷陳研究所的設立、現况和事業諸項、並講演中鳥居龍藏的「滿蒙旅行談、」各篇皆有精彩獨到處、按此種研究、實有使我人寒心者、</p>
<p>讀者如要詳知其内容並觀察其研究成績者、不妨買一册來看、係日本東京巿本鄉辻本鄉一丁目文求堂、發售定價日金二元、刻尚未見有中國譯文、</p>
<p>末了、我再附帶聲明一句、就是我所以要提供這册雜誌、爲的是希望中國學術界不要使人專美於前、而反把自巳的東西來抛荒、他們研究的專題是多麽切實啊、</p>

<h3>最近世界藝壇</h3>
<p>— 德明</p>
<p>法國藝壇最近的趨向</p>
<p>法國藝壇近來日趨平靜的狀態、就是那素以革命藝術爲號召的秋季沙龍也顯出弛緩的徵象來、這究竟是一種好現象呢、還是一種壞現象、我們不敢遽斷、不過由過度的奮激而趨於疲乏、這大概也是必然的傾向罷、</p>
<p>書籍揷畫</p>
<p>法國有一個書店老板名呌伏拉（Ambroise　Vollard)、他很能賞識藝術、他請着一般名畫家爲一些著名的文學作品描繪揷畫而刋印行世、三十年并前、他印過大詩人凡雷奴（Veralne）的兩部傑作、其中的揷畫係大畫家蓬那（Bonnard）所作、現在這兩部書都成了珍本、此外他又出版過羅丹、台尼斯（Maurice　Denis）和佩那爾（Bernard）作揷畫的幾部文學名著、現在他又請辟卡沙（Picasso）路爾脫（Roualt)拉伯勒特(Laprade)杜非(Dufy)和夏蓋爾（Chagall）等幾個大畫家合作書籍揷畫、將來這些書籍出版以後、一定是成爲出版界上最美麗的東西的、</p>

<p>「三面觀」（Glaces　a　Trois　Faces）是最近舉行於巴黎的一個展覽會的名字、爲什麽呌「三面觀」、原來是蒐集幾個畫家以同一模特兒爲對象所作的肖像丨每人三幅丨而展覽着、那幾個畫家是印象派大家番諾（Renoir）瑪麗沙(Berthe　Morisot)瑪麗卡莎（Mary　Casatt）吳伊拉（Vuillard)和台畢烏（Despian）、這個展覧會是很有興趣的、從中我們看到很有趣味的一點、就是現代藝術是注重主觀的、所以上面那些畫家雖寫同一模特兒的像、而作成之像初不相肖、如果呌幾個照相師式的畫匠畫詞一人的像、那末他們所得的結果必定是一式一樣的了、</p>
<p>柏林博物院的新建築物</p>
<p>柏林博物院是世界上規模最大收藏最富的博物院、最近那裏增添了許多新的建築物、此項新建築還是一九○一年之頃開工的、由當時的各建築家末資爾（Alfred　Messel）設計並任督造之責、後來末氏逝世、由另一建築家翟夫孟（Ludwig　Hoffman)繼續建造、大戰時工程中止、戰後數年、重行開工、到了去年年底、全部建築始行告竣、此項新建築物中的最重要的幾種是古代埃及希臘羅馬等的建築物的摹本、這些倣製出來的建築物式樣大小與原物一般無二、這種建築的目的在於使一般没有機會到那些古蹟的所在地去的人也得領略其彷彿、確爲大衆所需要、不過這種建築費用浩大、而工程方面尤多困難、實在只有德國人有那樣的魄力去做、别國的人不敢輕易嘗試、</p>
<p>波蘭新藝術機關</p>
<p>波蘭地方近來有一個新藝術機關成立、名爲「美術促進會」、那個機關的宗旨、是在引起大衆對於各種純粹的和應用的美術的注意與了解、那個機關於去年七月開始工作、那時他們在兩個熱鬧的避暑處舉行展覽會、可是他們的第一次的重要工作是最近在波京華波（Warsaw)舉行的農民藝術展覽會、農民藝術是民衆的藝術、當然是最容易引起大衆的興趣的、</p>
<p>芬蘭建築藝術</p>
<p>芬蘭人對於建築是異常注意的、那裏有幾件建築物可以說是現代建築界上最新奇特出的了、原來那邊是未來派建築藝術的胚胎地、</p>
<p>現代最著名的芬蘭建築家是薩利能（Gottlieb　Elieb　Saarinen）氏以一八七三年生於蘭德薩爾米(Rantasalm)他的傑作是海爾新福(Hekingfors芬蘭京城)與衛堡(Wiborg)兩處的火車、桑克（Lar　Soncki）也是一個傑出的建築家、芬蘭建築派之所以名聞全球而其影響之所以及於世界各國者、都是那兩大建築師之功、</p>
<h3>看了上海藝專學生諸君的作品後</h3>
<p>— 陳抱一</p>
<p>這是上海藝專二十年上届的畫展可惜會期略遲一點兒、但據說仍有冒着炎熱、流着汗珠而徘徊於會塲的熱心者、也在不少之數、</p>
<p>所陳列的、是以大部分學生的習作成績及畢業製作爲主、油畫占大多數、此外、作爲參考者、有外面加入的作家之作品若干、並有其中敎授的作品數點、</p>
<p>這個畫展的大體情形、我想曾往觀賞的人、都巳知道、而且各人自殊其觀點、也是當然的、……現在且就我個人的觀感、對於青年諸君的作品、略記數言、</p>
<p>在上海、可惜還没有正式的繪畫展覽會塲、故他們的作品、也只可就陳列於該校的敎室裏、全數的作品、佈滿於大小六個陳列室中、也因爲點數多而地方尚不夠、故畫與畫之距離、未免過於接近、觀者都感到這種缺點、</p>
<p>所有的作品、大部份給與人以明朗之感、與從來所見的沈鬱的作品、略異其傾向、然所謂「傾向」、並非如依了軍令也似地、一齊做同一的工作那樣的雷同的傾向、而似乎懷有異途同歸的趣旨、各人依其素質、向着廣大的「藝術道程」而循進的、也彷彿有如將作艱難的長途旅行時、先注意各自的康健及體力是很重要的一樣、似乎他們都自知檢點其「藝術上的康健和體力」的、</p>
<p>閒話少說、且來談及他們的作品、</p>
<p>從第一室起、順序地看來、……則陽太陽的「自畫像」、陳焯棠之「靜物」、曾笑漣之小幅的「人體」、及「風景」、謝超之「雪景」、「北站」、崔鎮傑的鉛筆「自畫像」、HF戴的「入暮」、廖飛來的「蘇州之橋」、「蘇堤」、李仲生之「水彩靜物」（其三）「油畫靜物」、杜超文之「風景」、胡昌歧之「靈隱古刹」、梁錫鴻之「風景」、「黄昏」、「花屋」、夏毅方之「校旁風景」、「院前」、……　　雍庭光之「裸女」、「西湖之春」、王淑仁之「人體」、杜十七之「西湖雨後」、「人體」等、曾志良的「穿襪裸女」、「ABC」、「小憇」、「街」等、陳焯棠的「花」、「横臥之裸女」等、楊秋人之「自畫像」、「湖」、「Maadolsne」及此外數點、陽光陽之「雨後」、「棲霞山道」、「春之畫」及此外數點、又、HF戴的「初夏」、「濱河之一角」、廖飛來之「杭州風景」、等等均屬佳作、其餘尚有若干、惟述之過煩、只好從略、</p>
<p>從佳作之中、也可以抽出幾個例、略述其特徵、……</p>
<p>陳焯棠……愛用暗澀的色彩、這裏所謂「暗澀色」、並非指隂重汚濁之一種色、而乃是暗澀之中、含有美的諧調的一種色、於色調上、他似乎是在摸索着這一種美的、如「横臥之裸女」、「花」「靜物」等、都示出這種特色、表現上、亦見率直而强勁、</p>
<p>詩色與上述那種對照的、就是楊林人及　太陽之作　、兩君的作風、雖特　各殊、然都是用明麗的色彩、</p>
<p>楊秋人……色調明美而不混雜、比較示出有多分的細緻的感覺、如大幅的「臥婦」、「自畫像」、「蘇堤之春」江「湖」等均爲人表之例、</p>
<p>楊太陽……色調明而鮮潤、筆致頗强而帶Rhythmical（韻律的）的氣勢、且有着豐裕之力、例如、以Naples　Yellow所描、富於Modele（肉量）的人體……「酒後」、和用圓大的筆觸、描寫樹木及遠山之潤綠的、「棲霞山道」、畫面甚渾厚而有清新之感、此外如「男之像」、「小憩」、「L姑娘」等等、均見有其明快的特徵、</p>
<p>杜十七……用筆勁達、色彩有沈着之美、比之上述的例、又是自異其特色者、其作品中、如「西湖雨後」、是用黑色與沈着的色彩所繪的、畫中線描、頗見美緻而切實、餘如「西湖風景」、「人體」等、都示出這個作家的描寫力、</p>
<p>曾志良的畫、亦見有明艶而强的色彩、而有着柔和的諧調、用筆亦見細心、惟對於表現之「强弱點」、如能注意、諒必效果更佳、從他的多數作品看來、可知他也是一個急速地在進步的努力者、其作品、如「街」、「小憇」、大幅的「綠衣少女」·「ABC」·「妹之肖像」（一）等均屬佳作、……此外尚見有幾點似未來派式的小作品、但以未來派論、則未免弱些、</p>
<p>對於作品、我的觀感如上、關於此外的作品、恕從略、</p>
<p>……藝術之研究、固然是要以「思想與技術」去鎔冶的、因爲一個畫家、也不只是一個僅習得一點表面的技巧的畫工、……然而繪畫之領域、究竟與文學之領域略殊、即言「思想的文學的要素」、在繪畫上、我也覺得非將那種「要素」與「表現」之點、溶合或反映成一個繪畫自身的「特質」不可、而似乎簡單地僅注重「題材」之選擇一事、是與「特質」不同的問題、這一點、是否應加以考慮的呢、</p>
<p>上面、只是對於「作品」這東西、就我個人所感到的、從「繪畫的」之點、略略說述而巳、故也未曾特把「題材」來文學的地、或思想的地加以說述、一則也因爲我的思想、是很淺小的的緣故、</p>
<p>末了、……這次所見的青年作家們的作品、不難測見其前途的輝耀、這是可欣喜的事情、然而、每因自足或别的關係、容易中途折志、這却是我們研究藝術者不得不注意的、</p>

<h3>Zhou Yubing Telephones Beijing to Report Truth of Wanbaoshan Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Zhou Yubing, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Changchun Municipal Government, yesterday, reporting the truth of the Wanbaoshan Incident. The original telegram is recorded below: "On June 8th, both parties sent personnel to investigate. On the 11th, this office sent a letter to the Japanese Consulate, stating that the waterway plan was not feasible according to law and fact. It would be best for the Koreans to grow dry rice or for the original recruiter, Hao Yongde, to compensate for the damage to resolve the matter. Later, it was claimed that the land was not suitable for dry rice and that they still intended to plant paddy fields. On the 16th, they violated the agreement again and sent Japanese police to secretly protect the work. On the 24th, they officially stated that they would determine whether there was any damage from the trial planting. Despite protests, they ignored them and the peasants gathered to fill the fields on July 1st. The Japanese Consulate sent machine gun police officers to shoot from all sides. This office officially protested that day, demanding that the offending police officers be punished and that all the officers sent be withdrawn immediately. Regarding the disputes between the parties concerned, it was suggested that they be resolved fairly according to law and treaty after the parties concerned made a request. After repeated consultations, the Japanese Consulate replied on the 10th that they could withdraw after our side confirmed their insistence, etc. I respectfully submit this telegram for consideration."</p>
<h3>Fan Guang Reports on Diplomatic Policy Towards Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Fan Guang, Counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reported at the weekly memorial service of the Ministry this morning that the most important efforts made by the Ministry last week were the Wanbaoshan Incident and the anti-Chinese problem of the Korean people. These two cases are independent of each other, and the Ministry believes that the two should not be discussed together. The Wanbaoshan Incident occurred locally, and the Ministry has telegraphed to inquire about the actual situation. It should be thoroughly investigated by local government offices and handled impartially according to law by the Central Government. The method of resolution will naturally be easy. However, the killing of overseas Chinese by the Korean people is different in severity, and the responsibility that the other government should bear is also very different. According to reports from all parties, the killing of overseas Chinese and the destruction of property by the Korean people this time is unusually brutal. The National Government has always adopted a policy of treating Korean residents in China equally and protecting them equally, but this incident occurred, which is very regrettable. Furthermore, observing the situation from all sides, the Korean people seem to have been instigated, and are being directed and incited by external forces. Local military and police have also failed to fulfill their corresponding responsibilities according to international law, giving sufficient protection to the lives and property of overseas Chinese. They did not try to resolve and eliminate the situation in advance, nor did they quickly stop the incident after it occurred and reduce the damage. This national responsibility is a principle of international law and should be observed by all civilized countries. The Ministry now only reserves the right to claim compensation based on international law. After ascertaining the truth, it will make serious negotiations regarding compensation for the lives and property of overseas Chinese. Minister Wang has already departed for Korea, and a detailed report will arrive in Beijing soon. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Details of the Busan Consulate Capturing an Assassin</h3>
<p>Consul Chen Continued to Telegraph Report to the Ministry</p>

The Ministry received a follow-up telegram from Consul Chen on the 11th, reporting the details of the capture of the assassin, stating briefly that on the 10th, a Korean man claiming to be of Chinese nationality, carrying a sharp weapon, broke into the consulate. He was captured by a Japanese martial artist and police auxiliary. According to the Korean man, he came to assassinate to vent his anger. He has now been escorted to the police station. According to people at the station, the Korean man is actually an ignorant person. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Insult by Others and Self-Insult (1)</h3>
<p>For nearly a hundred years, our country has been subjected to bullying and humiliation by the great powers every day. From the distant Boxer Rebellion and the Treaty of Shimonoseki to the recent Twenty-One Demands and the Jinan Incident, and most recently the Wanbaoshan Massacre and the Japanese instigation of Korean anti-Chinese sentiment, scars and bloodstains cover our body. Each time after being provoked, our people will awaken from their long dream, issue calls for resistance, hold meetings, march, and give speeches, creating a great commotion as if to stir up a tidal wave in the Pacific to wash away our unbearable humiliation. Similarly, after the Wanbaoshan Incident, the voices of resistance from all over the country have reverberated through the skies, with unified indignation against the enemy that is beyond containment. From one perspective, holding justice and making calls of blood and tears to strengthen diplomatic support with public sentiment is one way to resist insult and is a necessary means for national salvation. However, the source of shame and the reason for insult do not only come from others, but also largely from ourselves. Harm from others is minor, while disasters caused by ourselves are imminent. It is possible to resist those from others, but it is impossible to save those from ourselves. Focusing on those from others while ignoring those from ourselves, and always looking ten thousand miles away without ever holding a mirror to reflect ourselves, is precisely why our country has long been under the infringement and insult of the great powers and cannot free itself. A country must first insult itself before others can insult it. Just as an object must first rot before insects grow, if we can stand upright and self-strengthen ourselves, leaving no opportunity for exploitation, then foreigners will naturally not dare to impose oppression on us. Even if they do, a stern protest and harsh questioning will be enough to make the enemy country tremble. Conversely, if we cannot self-strengthen ourselves and crisis builds up, then those around us who are eyeing us covetously and want to chase us are all our tigers and wolves. The arrival of shame and insult does not only come from one country, nor can it only be resisted with empty words. Justice and righteousness are the names used by the weak to comfort themselves. We deeply hope that all actions between nations conform to justice and righteousness, but this kind of hope is often far from us. The ambitions and actions of the great powers cannot often be restrained by these abstract names. Therefore, the exchange of blood and tears and the calls for justice and righteousness are not enough to wash away shame, nor are they enough to resist insult, and therefore not enough to save the country. Seeking it in ourselves and considering it lightly in others, and taking advantage of this external disaster to be alert and self-aware, first not insulting ourselves and then resisting the insults of others, then with the size of our country and the number of our people, even if we do not insult others, no one should dare to insult us. Does our country today also have places of self-insult? Should the people of the country quickly rise up and first make a self-examination of the country?</p>
<h3>Major Financial Crisis Discovered in Germany</h3>
<p>The position of Germany today, whether it is safe or dangerous, affects the whole world. Previously, US President Hoover, seeing that Germany's financial crisis had reached its peak, rose up to advocate the postponement of indemnity payments. With one loud call, all countries responded, and the financial world gradually saw stability. The Germans were delighted and regarded it as a good medicine to rebuild the economy. However, unexpectedly, before things were actually implemented, Germany's financial world suddenly experienced unprecedented and drastic changes. The national bank suspended operations, and the stock exchange closed. If there is no quick rescue method at this time, the result will be financial bankruptcy and national chaos, which will make President Hoover's great undertaking to rescue finance equal to a bubble, and the painstaking efforts of all countries to assist will also be zero. Therefore, if Hoover and all countries want to complete the financial rescue plan from beginning to end, they must come out and do their best to help Germany in this dangerous situation. How well said Mussolini's words: The 66 million people of Germany are already in dire straits. Now, to avoid a major crisis in the world, the only way is to unite and maintain the current state of Germany. Otherwise, the red flames of the Rhine area will spread throughout Europe, and the whole world will also be affected. His words are shocking and will surely arouse the world's enthusiasm to help Germany and remove all difficulties in progress, and President Hoover's energetic rise can be imagined.</p>

<h3>Hebei Province Anti-Tax Movement</h3>
<p>Shao Hongji Investigates the Production and Sales Tax Case</p>
<p>Anti-Tax Group Hosts Beiping Press</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Hebei Chamber of Commerce Anti-Tax Group hosted reporters and reported on the content of the drafts to be delivered to various newspapers tonight. In addition to requesting assistance and guidance from the press, the steps taken were divided into three points: (1) The situation of the collection of production and sales taxes: a chicken is taxed one corner, and ten wooden sticks or pieces of cloth are taxed two yuan. Although this is caused by the tax officials, the high tax rate can be imagined. (2) The reason for initiating the organization: This group is organized by representatives of the Chambers of Commerce of 108 counties and towns. If the production and sales tax is not cancelled, our petitioning group will insist on it to the end. (3) The situation of the process: When our group first negotiated, Jing Youyan had already agreed to temporarily keep accounts and not to detain merchants' goods, and to fundamentally cancel the tax after Vice Commander Zhang recovered from his illness. Recently, in places such as Nankou, Gubeikou, Daming, and Longwangmiao, goods have been seized and taxes have been levied vigorously, which is a disregard for public opinion and an intentional incitement of unrest, which is very regrettable.

<p>Shao gave a speech saying that everyone's opposition to the production and sales tax is a legitimate act, and he hopes that they will persist to the end and that they will surely achieve their goal. Shao told reporters that the National Government's abolition of likin was originally intended to reduce the burden on the people. Vice Commander Zhang should comprehensively plan for the eight provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. After the abolition of likin, he should report to the central government for a subsidy for the annual shortfall in government expenses. Since the central government has already implemented an increase in customs duties, it cannot ignore the shortage of government expenses in various provinces. If the central government does not care, it should also make the people of the eight provinces bear the burden equally and not increase taxes in Hebei Province alone to subsidize other provinces. I will go to Beiping on the morning of the 14th and return to Beijing on the evening train. (13th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>"All Countries Should Unite to Avert the World Crisis. If a Red Flame Ignites in the Rhineland, All of Europe Will Be Set Ablaze." Italy Is Willing to Do Its Utmost to Help.</p>
<p>The French Cabinet Will Also Consider It.</p>
<h3>Reuters Berlin, 12th</h3>
<p>The German Cabinet has been in session almost constantly since yesterday afternoon. At the same time, the government's Compensation Committee, the board of directors of the National Bank, and important bankers have also gathered to discuss solutions, and some have joined last night's cabinet meeting. The government is determined not to comply with France's demands to stop building warships and abolish the German-Austrian customs union, and describes this demand as the worst kind of blackmail. The government feels that the majority of the people will support the government's move, preferring to risk a financial crisis rather than accept France's demands. It is widely believed that Prime Minister Brüning will be able to reverse the calamity, but he must stop the run on the National Bank tomorrow. The rumor that France is demanding the dissolution of the Stahlhelm is not true. President Hindenburg is the chairman of the party. Brüning has notified the UK and the US that the cabinet would rather resign than accept France's demands, adding that replacing the most stable government with those who advocate激烈的nationalism will be greatly detrimental to Europe.</p>
<h3>Reuters Berlin, 12th</h3>
<p>The national newspapers are very angry with France. The organ of the Democratic Party sums up the general opinion, saying that we blame France and Briand, the hypocritical pro-European, who want to use debt to break the backbone of German politics and make Germany subservient forever.</p>
<h3>Reuters Berlin, 12th</h3>
<p>While the cabinet was deliberating overnight on the emergency decrees to be issued tomorrow, the National Bank, one of Germany's most important banks, declared that it was forced to suspend payments. The government has notified the bank that, according to the emergency decrees, the government guarantees all deposits of the bank and monitors the liquidation. The Minister of Commerce of Prussia has ordered the stock exchanges of Prussia to close on Monday and Tuesday. It is rumored that other federal states will follow suit. The bankruptcy of the National Bank is the biggest collapse in the German banking industry in many years. The government fears that there will be a run on cash at various banks. The National Bank has a capital of 3 million pounds and paid a dividend of 80% last year, employing a total of 7,000 people. Its president, Schmidt, is known as an outstanding talent in the financial world. A few days ago, the North German Wool Company failed, owing the bank a huge sum, but it was unexpected that it would announce the suspension of payments.</p>

<h3>Reuters New York, 12th</h3>
<p>There is now reason to believe that official circles have indicated that assistance to Germany must come from banks, not from the government.

It is reported that Acting Secretary of State Castle claimed that the news from Germany was somewhat inaccurate and that all kinds of difficulties could be overcome.

Therefore, the congestion of people seeking to exchange foreign currency has been temporarily stopped, allowing the government to consider ways to maintain the Mark during this time. The various cabinet members returned from a meeting last night until early this morning to rest briefly and then continued to meet this morning to prepare urgently for the announcement of the decree. The subject of the decree is roughly "Steps for the Economic Fate and Financial Reorganization of Germany." The Governor of the National Bank, Luther, also attended the meeting this time, because Luther had to abandon his trip to Basel due to the urgent domestic situation. He was also unable to personally attend the meeting of the board of directors of the Bank for International Settlements, only sending a representative, Bianke, to negotiate everything. After the cabinet meeting, Luther immediately convened a meeting of the board of directors of the National Bank to discuss how to crack down on the public's frenzy of buying foreign currency, or that in an emergency, the bank will take the privileges allowed in the emergency decree and temporarily cancel the permission to exchange cash or foreign currency. However, if the United States can generously provide relief within a few days so that the German National Bank can maintain its position, then this last resort may be avoided. Furthermore, President Hoover is now doing his best to unite national reserve banks and private capital groups to find ways to provide relief, and the exchange of telegrams between Washington and the US embassy in Berlin is also very busy, so hope for the future is not yet exhausted. On the other hand, the German people's attitude of uniting as one to resist the blackmail conditions of France has made it impossible for the government to violate the will of the people. Brüning has declared that he would rather resign than be directed by the French, and President Hindenburg said that his neck could not be bent by the oppression of France.</p>
<h3>National News Agency Berlin, 12th</h3>
<p>The German government has unanimously rejected the conditions of the French government to rescue the German financial crisis. After a cabinet meeting all night, a communiqué was issued early this morning stating that if Germany allows France to use Germany's financial difficulties to gain political concessions, it will set a dangerous precedent and fears that France will be insatiable and will continue to make new demands. When the cabinet meeting was held, there were as many as 100 German and foreign news reporters gathered at the Prime Minister's Office waiting for the cabinet's decision.</p>
<h3>National Society, Berlin Dispatch, 13th</h3>
<p>The financial and political situation in Germany is becoming increasingly critical. No one dares to predict the changes within the next twelve hours. The Darmstädter National Bank has suspended payments, further increasing public panic. Although the government has declared that it will guarantee the bank's deposits, it has failed to reduce the people's distrust of other banks. Therefore, to prevent the run on other banks, the government immediately declared that all deposits in national banks would be guaranteed by the state. This measure seems to have temporarily stabilized the public's confidence. Regarding the foreign aid issue, Luther rushed to Basel early this morning to continue negotiations, and it is expected that he will report the results to the government this evening. As for the political situation, it is also quite chaotic. The news that the German government rejected the political concessions demanded by the French has not only been reported by German newspapers this morning, but also widely reported by newspapers in Paris and London, which seems to be true. However, reliable sources suddenly claimed this afternoon that this demand was purely a rumor, and that the French government had never made any formal or informal political demands when negotiating the loan issue. If this news is true, it will inevitably plunge people into confusion.</p>
<h3>National Society, Berlin Dispatch, 13th</h3>
<p>The German cabinet meeting has been held almost continuously for thirty-three hours. After adjourning at 2:45 this morning, a public announcement was issued regarding the suspension of business by the Darmstädter National Bank, stating that according to reliable information, the bank has a capital and reserve of 60 million marks, but the losses have exceeded this amount.</p>
<h3>National Society, New York Dispatch, 13th</h3>
<p>U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury Mills declared today that the United States cannot intervene in Germany's current financial crisis. Since President Hoover issued the proposal to suspend war debt payments, the United States has already done a lot to help the Germans. Mills made this statement after an all-night meeting with key figures from the New York Federal Reserve Bank, which provides insight into the bank's attitude towards providing aid to German banks. Acting Secretary of State Castle also stated that the key to preventing Germany's financial collapse lies in the hands of the central banks of Europe. The heads of these banks are meeting in Basel today to consider the current situation in Germany.</p>

Recently, it has been reported that in the Wanpaoshan area of Changchun County, Jilin, Korean immigrants, under the instigation of the Japanese, dug ditches and built dikes within our Chinese territory, extending for more than twenty li, destroying our fertile fields for no reason. The farmers in the area, because their fields were dug up and could not be cultivated, came out to question them, but the Japanese had ulterior motives, were unreasonable, and instead shielded the Korean immigrants, continuing to dig the ditches as usual, and dispatched armed military police to surround our farmers and fire machine guns, killing more than ten people on the spot, creating a scene of terror, making the May 3rd Massacre reoccur today. Such trampling on our nation and disregard for our national rights, if we do not urgently plan to deal with it, what can we expect for the future? The Association's concerns are truly difficult to bear. We urgently request the Council to promptly consult with the National Government, ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest to maintain the foundation of the country. This urgent telegram leaves us with nothing but to await your orders.

<h3>Japan's Policy Toward China After the Korean Massacre of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Permission for Koreans to Enter Chinese Nationality</p>
<p>Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans Living Together</p>
<p>Koreans Also Have the Right of Mixed Residence</p>
<p>Otherwise, There Will Be a Last Resort</p>
<p>Tokyo Communication: Although the large-scale massacre of overseas Chinese in various parts of Korea this time appears to be a riot by Koreans, it is indeed instigated by the Japanese. The strength of the Japanese police stationed in Korea is not weak, and the reason why they cannot effectively protect the overseas Chinese is nothing more than to use the Wanpaoshan case in Korea to drive out our country's overseas Chinese in Korea by intimidating the ringleader of renting land to Koreans, Hao Yongde.</p>
<p>In the past, Koreans once massacred Japanese residents in Korea. Within five hours, Japanese troops were dispatched, and martial law was immediately declared throughout Korea, and more than 2,000 Korean civilians were executed, and the turmoil was immediately quelled. This time, when Koreans massacred overseas Chinese, the actual number of Japanese troops mobilized was only more than 30, and everything was maintained only by the police, resulting in the tragic deaths of more than 200 overseas Chinese and more than 10,000 being homeless, and the turmoil lasted for several days. The Japanese government did not use a quick method to quell the turmoil, and on the one hand, it publicized to the international community that this incident was not a massacre of overseas Chinese by Koreans, but a conflict between China and Korea, and that the conflict between Koreans and overseas Chinese was in retaliation for the Wanpaoshan incident. The Japanese government can only provide relief and condolences to the victimized overseas Chinese and cannot be responsible for the compensation for the losses of the overseas Chinese. As for its future diplomatic policy toward China, it was discussed at the temporary cabinet meeting on the 7th of this month, and as a result of discussions among Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara, Hara Taku, and the newly appointed Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki Kazushige, the following matters were decided: (1) The Governor-General's Office and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs are jointly responsible for this incident, and the Japanese government is not responsible for it. (2) The Japanese government will never bear the responsibility for the demands for compensation for life and property damage put forward by the Chinese government. However, within the possible scope, it will provide relief to the overseas Chinese in Korea. The Japanese government, based on the private proposal of the former Governor-General Saito, has formulated a fundamental policy for the future of Korea and Manchuria, the so-called Manchurian-Korean integration policy. After the situation is calmed down, the negotiations will be submitted to the Northeast authorities. The content is as follows: (1) The issue of the naturalization of Koreans will be left to their free choice in the future, and Koreans will be allowed to enter Chinese nationality. (2) Negotiations will be held with the Northeast authorities to ensure that Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans can live together in the Eastern Provinces. Japanese will invest, Chinese will engage in agriculture, commerce, and industry, and Koreans will cultivate paddy fields to make up for the shortcomings of the Eastern Provinces. (3) Japanese have the right to mixed residence in the Eastern Provinces, and Koreans are required to have the same rights in the Eastern Provinces, as well as land use rights, and absolutely guarantee the taxes and obedience of Koreans to the orders of the Chinese local government. Japan's aggressive behavior toward the Eastern Provinces is as blatantly expressed as described above, and its intention is to say that this policy can maintain peace between China, Japan, and Korea. If China can recognize its conditions, it can be safe, otherwise there is still a last resort. (July 8)</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of the Wanpaoshan Case</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Calls Zhou Yuping His Second Father</p>
<p>Hao Yongde Cunningly Claims He Wants to Fight the Koreans</p>
<p>Municipal Government Reports That TasHiro Is the Culprit</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: The reporter went to the scene of the Wanpaoshan case to investigate yesterday. The current situation of Majiashao口 was recorded in detail in yesterday's news. Now, the important conversations and documents are recorded in detail as follows:</p>
<h3>Compilation of Important Conversations</h3>
<p>After the Wanpaoshan conflict occurred, the Japanese side expanded its publicity, saying that 50 Korean Communist Party members were arrested and escorted to Jilin, and that farmers had withdrawn 1,000 meters and would attack again. After the reporter's investigation, it was proved that these were all untrue. However, the Japanese government attached importance to this case. In addition to ordering Consul Ishishe stationed in Jilin to protest to the Jilin Provincial Government, it also ordered the chief of the Kwantung Office, who was on his way to inspect the Wanpaoshan case, to investigate nearby. This is the situation of the Korean and Japanese police resting at the place where the police confronted the Chinese farmers on the second day of the Wanpaoshan case.</p>
<p>Kan塚本氏, to investigate nearby. Tsukamoto arrived in Jilin on the 4th and passed through Jilin to the south by land and sea on the evening of the 6th. Consul Ishishe arrived in Changchun early on the 3rd and met with Consul-General TasHiro Shigedoku stationed in Changchun to discuss everything. He returned to Jilin that evening. The Japanese residents in Changchun held a general meeting of overseas Chinese on the afternoon of the 4th, with thousands of people attending, and decided to ask TasHiro to be firm to the end and assist the Koreans in digging ditches. If necessary, garrison troops could be sent. If the garrison troops were insufficient, retired soldiers from overseas Chinese could be recruited to form a support团. It was decided to telegraph the provincial government and the central government to ask the Japanese diplomatic support会. It was decided to telegraph the provincial government and the central government to ask the Japanese to seriously negotiate. Students in Changchun also held a meeting on the 6th and established the Chang City Student Wanpaoshan Case Support Association. On the same day, they sent a telegram to the provincial government, asking for an expedited negotiation, demanding that the Japanese withdraw their armed police and stop the dike construction work. The farmers' representative, Qu Xianglou, told the reporter that the farmers in the Wanpaoshan case would not end the movement until the original state was restored. If dams were built downstream of the Yitong River and flooded, the farmers would definitely fight the Japanese police to the death. Since the occurrence of this case, about 300 households have been impoverished due to the destruction of their fields, and their lives are at stake and cannot be ignored. Zhou Yuping, the director of the municipal government, who is in charge of the negotiations on our side, said that the negotiations have been suspended, and protests have been made twice, but the Japanese consul has not responded. The current situation is beyond the ability of the local government to negotiate a solution. However, the Japanese side, with TasHiro's attitude being the strongest, and the others being more moderate, TasHiro has met with me many times, and he has always said that keeping the interests of the Koreans is the prerequisite. Because I did not agree to his request, he even called me his "second father." I don't know what his despicable and shameless intentions are. Koreans planting rice in Wanpaoshan has not been approved by the government and has no legal basis. The Japanese side has long lost the position to negotiate. Because planting rice fields has caused resentment from the majority of farmers, the Japanese police have an allowance of three yuan in gold notes per officer per day, totaling more than 70 officers, requiring tens of thousands per month. Once the Japanese police withdraw, conflicts between the Korean civilians and our farmers will arise. If the Japanese police do not withdraw, the cost will be high. Moreover, building a dam in the Yitong River is a very large project. Digging a ditch eight feet deep is not enough to introduce water. It must be deepened by several feet. The Japanese police tents at Majiashao mouth in Wanbaoshan case</p>
<p>, water can enter the ditch, which is costly and time-consuming, and it may not be satisfactory. If the water势 is large, the dam will collapse, and all previous efforts will be in vain. This is technically unwise. The Japanese Consul in Jilin, Mr. Ishishe, has said that he is following his government's orders to mediate the situation. Ishishe has visited Shi Luben, the director of the Jilin Special Commissioner's Office, and said that the matter can be resolved by compensating the Korean civilians for their losses, but TasHiro Shigedoku is not willing to resolve it this way yet. However, if the dam is not successful, the water does not enter the canal, and there is no way to go, Ishishe will eventually have to come forward to negotiate. In short, this matter is attributed to the Japanese Consul TasHiro, who is young and likes to stir up trouble. It is regrettable that the Japanese government has sent him to Changji, which is a lot of trouble. Hao Yongde, the local bully who rented land to the Korean civilians, has been detained by the county government for two months. The reporter visited the county public security bureau detention center and saw him.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Proposed, Hao's appearance is fierce, and at first glance, he is not a kind person. When he saw the reporter, he kowtowed and said, "My lord, save my life." When asked about his collusion with the Korean civilians, he said that he had rented 500 hectares of wasteland from Zhang Hongbin and others, paying a rent of 1.2斗 per hectare, and then sublet it to the Koreans in the name of the Chang Nong Company, paying a rent of 2斗 per mu. He had agreed with Director Ma (that is, Ma Ji-yuan, the head of the Second Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the younger brother of County Magistrate Ma Zhongyuan) in advance and spent a certain amount of money. The county magistrate had already agreed, but for some reason, he did not allow the planting, and he detained me for two months, not allowing me to go out. If I am released, I will fight the Koreans to the death and drive them away.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zuoxiang's Attitude</h3>
<p>Zhang Zuoxiang was in his ancestral home in Jinzhou on the day the case occurred, holding a three-week memorial ceremony for his mother. Upon hearing the report, he immediately telegraphed the Changchun Municipal Government to inquire about the truth and ordered the provincial government to send people to investigate. Secretary Pan of the Provincial Government also arrived in Changchun early on the 5th to investigate the details and returned to Jilin on the 6th. The following is the telegram from the Municipal Government to Zhang Zuoxiang: "To Commander Zhang in Jinzhou: The Changchun County Wanpaoshan Koreans are forcibly digging up the people's fields to open waterways, intending to build dams across the Yitong River and force water to irrigate rice fields. The farmers reported to the county to stop them. The Japanese Consul sent police to protect them and carried out the work. After the two sides discussed, they agreed to withdraw the police and stop the work and conduct a joint on-site investigation to resolve the matter. After the investigation, it was found that not only did the waterway pass through the ownership of more than 20 li of farmers, but also the cultivated land of each household was cut into two sections, making cultivation even more inconvenient. Moreover, if the transverse river dam is implemented, navigation will be interrupted, which will hinder transportation, and if the river is raised, thousands of hectares of farmland along the banks will be inundated. The facts have been officially communicated and are indisputable. However, the Japanese Consul TasHiro Shigedoku blatantly disregarded them and continued to send plainclothes Japanese police officers with weapons to protect and continue the work on June 12th. The Wanpaoshan case 5 Koreans cutting willow branches to build dams</p>
<p>repeatedly formally inquired and earnestly informed that if the police were not withdrawn and the work was not stopped, all disputes and losses that may occur in the future should be fully borne by the other party. The consul ignored it and insisted on proceeding with the work. The farmers in the area were angry and indignant and were forced to gather more than 300 people on July 1st to implement legitimate means of self-defense and restore the original state. The consul requested that the Public Security Bureau be ordered to stop them. After refusing him with reason, the consul continued to send a large number of armed Japanese police officers, carrying machine guns, and went to stop the farmers when they gathered on the morning of the 2nd. When the farmers' representatives went forward to reason, they were beaten and injured. The group rushed to protect them. The Japanese police fired more than 30 live rounds, and the farmers jumped into the trenches, so there were no deaths or injuries. The other side continued to increase the armed police officers, carrying machine guns, and now there are about 50 or 60 Japanese police officers, and they forcibly occupied the farmers' courtyards along the river, intending to occupy them. The local authorities sent another letter to the Japanese Consul on the 2nd, instructing him to withdraw all the police officers on that day and punish the Japanese police officers who caused the trouble. At the same time, the county comforted the farmers and waited for negotiations to resolve the matter. The other party has not yet replied. Before receiving the telegram, he combined the report and asked for transfer to the department to verify the facts of this case and submit it to the Japanese ambassador for serious and fundamental negotiations, so as to resolve the matter and avoid side issues.

<h3>The Impact of the Korean Civilian Riots in Andong Continued</h3>
<p>Secretary Huang Goes to Sinuiju to Investigate</p>
<p>Consul Zhu Describes the Various Situations of the Riots</p>
<p>The Diplomatic Support Association Issues a Declaration</p>
<p>Andong Communication: The incident of the Korean civilians rioting and oppressing the Chinese has continued to expand in scope in recent days and has spread to the territory of Pingan北 Road in West Korea. Yesterday's communication briefly described its outline. Now, the details of this tragedy will be continued and recorded later. On the morning of the 8th, according to Chinese civilians who fled back from Incheon, Korea, no less than a thousand overseas Chinese were sheltering in the Incheon Consulate and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. They all said that the rioters were still rampant, and the consulate was not a safe place, so it was inconvenient to stay any longer. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 6th, they boarded the Litong轮船 together and immediately set sail to various ports in Shandong to take refuge. Wang Jie-gong, the county magistrate of Andong and the Andong diplomatic negotiator, properly accommodated the Chinese civilians who fled back from the Korean coast to avoid displacement, and also learned that the truth about the tragedy in the Korean interior was unclear and needed to be investigated urgently to rely on verification and handling. Therefore, on the morning of the 8th, Dongwen Diplomatic Secretary Huang Fuyuan was specially dispatched to go to Sinuiju by car with a translator from the Public Security Bureau to pay respects to the Chinese Consul Zhu and inquire about the actual situation. According to Consul Zhu, the riots in the Korean interior were the worst in Kyoto, Incheon,宣川, etc. The number of Chinese civilians killed</p>
<p>Wanpaoshan case 6 Japanese police invaded the house of Wang, a farmer at the former Majiashao mouth. The one standing upright is Takahashi Hiroshi of the Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>, the exact number is unknown. From the 6th, the riot incident became more and more extensive and has spread to Sinuiju. On the 6th and 7th, rioters were repeatedly found in the city of Sinuiju, attacking Chinese civilians and destroying Chinese merchants in groups of three or five. According to statistics, only three Chinese civilians were seriously injured in Sinuiju. On the evening of the 7th, the wind was tight, and everyone was on edge. The general Chinese civilians were extremely panicked and said that before 12 o'clock that night, the rioters would start an incident, burning down Chinese houses and destroying the Chinese Consulate. At that time, the Japanese Police Department in the area also received the same report, and after requesting by the Chinese side, they temporarily prepared for it. In addition to adding posts in front of the Chinese Consulate and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, they also patrolled all night to ensure peace. On the morning of the 8th, a telegram was received from宣川, saying that the area had been pacified. The Pingan北 Road Office had learned of the unrest among the Korean civilians five days ago and had transferred 50 police officers from the Kyoto-义 line and distributed them in the city of Sinuiju for security. The Korean intellectual class in Sinuiju, such as the Youth Association and reporters from various news agencies</p>
<p>Wanpaoshan case 7 The farmland on both sides of the lower reaches of the Yitong River may be flooded due to the increase in the water势 caused by the dam construction</p>
<p>etc., visited Consul Zhu on the morning of the 7th and apologized verbally, and stated that they would stop the rioters and protect the overseas Chinese. On the afternoon of the same day, the group voluntarily held a meeting to discuss the aftermath and invited powerful Chinese figures to attend and comfort the Chinese civilians. Another reporter from the East Asia Daily Branch, Cui Fan-xi, returned from Wanpaoshan three days ago. He attended the meeting temporarily that day and reported on the actual situation, saying that although the two sides were facing each other, they did not fire. On the morning of the 8th, the Andong National Diplomatic Support Association issued a declaration for the Korean civilian riot incident, calling on fellow citizens, with a length of about a thousand words. The Liaoning Xinmin Evening News was blacklisted by the Japanese side for recording the Korean civilian riot incident on the fourth page of the newspaper on the 8th. At 7:00 a.m. on the 8th, the newspaper was transported to Andong Station, where it was detained by the Japanese police, and the fourth page was cut off by two columns before it was returned to the newspaper clerks for distribution.

<h3>Telegram Original</h3>
<p>(1) Telegram to the National People: "It has been discovered that the Japanese and Koreans are conspiring to forcibly excavate farmland in Wanbaoshan, and have shot and killed our farmers and police. These brutal actions have reached their extreme. Furthermore, the Japanese have incited Koreans to massacre our overseas Chinese in Korea for days, with the number exceeding one thousand. Shops have been burned, and there have been attacks and looting. The situation is increasingly dire, causing our overseas Chinese to lose all protection of their lives and property. As a result, no fewer than ten thousand have fled back to the country or taken refuge in various consulates. The pitiful situation is unbearable to witness. Anyone with a shred of conscience, how can they endure this? Although the government has made serious protests, they show no sincerity and attempt to evade responsibility. Such disregard for humanity and cunning pursuit of wicked schemes makes them public enemies in the international community and vermin among rulers. All of us Chinese people should rise up and urge the government to engage in stern negotiations with them, vowing to achieve the goals of punishing the murderers, providing compensation and consolation, issuing apologies, and providing concrete guarantees that such incidents will not happen again. Better to be a broken jade than an intact tile; this is a crucial moment. This telegram is urgent, please take note." (2) Telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang and the Northeast Political Affairs Committee: "Recent newspapers have detailed reports and telegrams from various sources regarding the Wanbaoshan case. The Japanese incited Koreans to forcibly excavate civilian land, destroy roads, and build dikes. Japanese police then shot and killed our farmers and police. Our legitimate and inherent industries and our good and honest farmers have been subjected to brutal and inhumane treatment by these Japanese devils and Koreans who have lost their country and their homes, being slaughtered at will. Just speaking of it is enough to make one's hair stand on end. Furthermore, Koreans in Pyongyang, Incheon, and other places in Korea have been engaged in狂肆暴動 daily狂肆暴動, slaughtering overseas Chinese, burning and looting shops, destroying houses, and attacking markets. These are all organized acts of violence. The Japanese are covering their ears while stealing a bell. The intentions of Sima Zhao are clear to everyone. Such cruelty and inhumanity, disregarding humanity, law, international credibility, arbitrarily poisoning, and acting recklessly, have caused our farmers and overseas Chinese to lose all protection of their lives and property. Looking from afar at our homeland, our hearts are filled with pain. In addition to requesting the National Government to quickly order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to engage in serious negotiations, and not stop until the goals of punishing the murderers, providing compensation and consolation, issuing apologies, and providing concrete guarantees that such incidents will not happen again are achieved, we also request your committee to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident, report it to the central government, and immediately arrest all the treacherous people such as Hao Yongde, punish them with the most severe punishments, to maintain law and order, and ensure the people's safety. This telegram is anxious, filled with urgent sincerity. Fellow villagers from the three northeastern provinces traveling in Beijing kowtow."</p>
<h3>Petition</h3>
<p>A petition concerning the Wanbaoshan case, which has caused suffering to overseas Chinese in Korea. We earnestly request your committee to forward a letter to the National Government quickly to engage in serious negotiations with Japan to maintain the people's lives and protect national rights. It has been discovered that in the Wanbaoshan area of Jilin, Korean residents have been driven by Japanese police to dig ditches and build dams without authorization, destroying our farmland, leading to conflicts with the local people. The fault lies with them, not with us. However, the newspapers of the Japanese Empire have falsely claimed that the Chinese are oppressing the Koreans, deliberately stirring up trouble. They have embellished the story, leading to the tragic anti-Chinese incidents throughout Korea. Looking eastward to Korea, we cannot help but feel grief and indignation. Our fellow villagers from the eastern provinces feel the pain most acutely. We deeply feel that this unfortunate event, having expanded to such an extent, cannot be resolved merely through verbal arguments or written telegrams. We must urgently seek a solution. Therefore, our association has convened fellow villagers and unanimously decided to request the central government to take the following actions: (1) Please send a letter to the National Government to announce the full details of this incident to all countries in the world, so that friendly nations can understand the truth and avoid being misled by the cunning propaganda of the Japanese. (2) The government should immediately implement all effective and necessary measures to protect overseas Chinese in various parts of Korea. (3) Please send a letter to the National Government to engage in serious negotiations with Japan, punish the rioters, provide compensation to the victims among the overseas Chinese, compensate for all losses, and provide conditional guarantees that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. (4) Please send a letter to the National Government ordering the Ministry of Interior to carefully plan for future matters such as Korean residents' naturalization or entry and residence in China, and instruct local governments in all provinces to strictly comply with these plans. (5) The Wanbaoshan tragedy was partly due to the deliberate instigation by Japan, but also due to the local treacherous people seeking profit. Please send a letter to the National Government ordering the Jilin Provincial Government to severely punish the treacherous people who caused the incident and instruct the provincial government to pay attention to various activities of Korean residents entering the country in the future, to prevent problems before they arise. The above points are the opinions of our association of fellow villagers after repeated consideration and unanimous decision. We specially submit this petition to your committee, requesting you to consider it and forward it to the National Government for quick implementation to protect the lives of overseas Chinese and preserve national rights. We are filled with fear and await your orders. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee, the Dongsan Province Association of Fellow Villagers in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Lu Xun's View on Korean Anti-Chinese Sentiment</h3>

<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>A telegram report stating that they have met with Zhang Weicheng, our country's Consul General in Korea. According to the discussion, the animosity between our people and Koreans has been deepening in recent years. There were originally 91,500 overseas Chinese residing in Korea, but the number has gradually decreased. The reasons are: (1) Overseas Chinese are hardworking and enduring, which has long been resented by Koreans. Recently, many Koreans have become unemployed, leading to restrictions on the entry of overseas Chinese, requiring registration and deliberately causing difficulties. (2) Chinese overseas Chinese in Korea are mostly engaged in the silk industry. Recently, the increase in tariffs has had a major impact. The ramie fabric industry initially earned 4-5 million yuan annually, but recently the Japanese have been promoting the use of ramie fabric woven by Taiwanese people and wearing colored clothes, leading to a decline in business. (3) Overseas Chinese lack education. There is only one small primary school inside the consulate in Hanjing, accommodating 170 students, and one after-school tutoring school. Few receive education, and knowledge inevitably lags behind. (4) Last year, the Northeast expelled communist Koreans, deepening the animosity between the two sides. It is fortunate that no accidents have occurred, etc. Unexpectedly, the Wanbaoshan incident occurred on July 2nd. However, the reasons for Korean anti-Chinese sentiment have been gradually building up.</p>
<p>The entire committee of the Shandong Provincial Government is extremely indignant about the Wanbaoshan case and immediately sent a telegram to Chairman Jiang of the National Government, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to engage in serious negotiations. The telegram reads as follows: "To Chairman Jiang of the Nanjing National Government: It has been found that in the Jilin Wanbaoshan case, the Korean侨民 people were at fault for committing violence first, which is a disregard for public reason. However, according to newspaper reports, Korean civilians in Pyongyang, Yuan 산 and other places in Korea have been rioting for days, burning down Chinese shops and massacring overseas Chinese residents. It is clear that they were instigated by others, leading to this tragedy. All nationals share the same righteous indignation. We, who love our country and our people, dare not lag behind. We earnestly request your government to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to engage in serious negotiations with the Japanese side to stop the violence and provide relief. We are filled with fear and await your orders. Chairman Han Fuqu of the Shandong Provincial Government, Committee members Li Shuchun, Wang Fangting, Wang Xiangrong, Liu Zhennian, He Siyuan, Zhang Honglie, Ma Hongkui, Zhang, and Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, all respectfully kowtow. (July 11th)"</p>
<h3>Annihilation of Red Army, Successive Capture of Famous Bandit Nests</h3>
<p>Tengtian, Baisha, and Huangpi are successively recovered</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the 1st of this month, the annihilation of the Red Army has launched a major offensive against the bandit nests. The commanders of the various armies and divisions have personally gone to the front lines to command. The left, center, and right routes have all been in contact for days. Due to a lack of ammunition, the bandits are making every effort to shorten their defense lines and retreat to their old nests and western Fujian. The retreat from eastern Jiangxi is the fastest. The left wing of the annihilation of the Red Army captured Lichuan on the day. The right wing of the annihilation of the Red Army captured Huxi Yaotian and continues to search forward. They captured Tengtian on the 7th. The bandits retreated from Huangma back to Donggu. Our division occupied Shuinan Shuikou on the same day, and completely occupied Baisha on the 9th. The 19th Route Army is not far from Futian. The above places are all famous bandit nests, and Futian Donggu are located between Jishui and Ji'an, in a dangerous location. They are also the location of the Red Bandit Provincial Government and other institutions. If they are captured together, the Red Bandits will lose their base. On the central front, according to air force reports, a part of our army occupied Huangpi on the border of Yihuang Le'an and then advanced to Liaopi on the border of Zhaoxie. However, during the progress of each of these units, the bandits in Yudu Xingguo suddenly attempted to flee to Ganzhou. Recently, Kong Shaoyao and Chen Panzao, representatives of the people of Ganxian traveling in the province, have successively petitioned the authorities to send troops to rescue them.

<h3>Central Committee and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Fang Juehui Encourages Party Members to Intensify Work</p>
<p>Shao Yuanchong Discusses Central Government's Anti-Smoking Policy</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>On the morning of July 13th at 9:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held the 120th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the auditorium. Central Committee members Ding Weifen, Fang Juehui, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Miao Peicheng, and others, as well as officials from various departments and guests, totaling about 500 people, attended. Chairman Ding Weifen presided. After the ceremony, Fang Juehui reported that the opening of the Fourth National Congress is less than three months away. During this period, all comrades of our party should reflect on the achievements and effects of party affairs and politics in the two years since the Third National Congress and should consider the extent to which party affairs and politics should develop after the Fourth National Congress, the benefits that the people should receive, and how to achieve this. In terms of past work, a few comrades have two shortcomings: one is laissez-faire, a lack of a sense of responsibility, which prevents the party's strength from being fully promoted; the other is romanticism, in which one's own environment is slightly stimulated, or one's aspirations are not satisfied, and a kind of divergent thought arises, often leading to misconduct. Therefore, before the upcoming Fourth National Congress, we must strictly examine ourselves and immediately correct our mistakes. Regarding the agenda of the Fourth National Congress, ten principles have been determined, which are of great importance, and it is necessary to actively study them beforehand. In terms of party affairs, we should focus on practical work, establish propaganda and news policies. In terms of politics, we should rectify national defense to resist foreign aggression and implement revolutionary diplomacy to restore national sovereignty. These are especially urgent needs of the times. All of our comrades should understand the danger of the country's position, concentrate their minds and talents with a spirit of striving and diligence, and engage in practical research so as to prepare rich materials and perfect plans for future contributions in order to achieve satisfactory results and create a new life in party affairs and politics. Regarding the suppression of bandits, Commander-in-Chief Chiang is supervising the advance in the front, determined to live and die with the people. All the soldiers under his command are united in their efforts to charge and break through the enemy lines. It is expected that the rebellious and rampant mob will be quickly wiped out. Commander-in-Chief Chiang also pays special attention to official governance during his military rule, strictly prohibiting corruption, because society as a whole depends on the support of the people. The people must have a common life and not be exploited by corrupt officials before the social organization can be sound, order can be stable, the scourge of the people can be eliminated, and the people's livelihood can be prosperous. Having obtained the way to rectify the root and clear the source, sweeping away the evil atmosphere is just a matter of time. It is hoped that the comrades in the rear will intensify their work during this critical period, just like the efforts during the conquest of Feng Yan last year. It would be even better if the comrades in various agencies could add one or two hours to their daily fixed working hours, etc. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM after the report.</p>
<h3>National Government</h3>
<p>On the morning of the same day at 10:00 AM, the National Government held Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Shao Yuanchong, Shao Lizi, Ye Chucang, Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, Zhu Lühe, Li Shuhua, Chen Bulei, Qian Changzhao, Wang Boqun, Gu Zhutong, and other government officials, totaling over 300 people, attended. Yu Youren presided. Shao Yuanchong spoke on the central government's anti-smoking policy, roughly saying that in recent weeks, the people of the country have paid close attention to the anti-smoking issue. A few weeks ago, a large batch of opium was transported from Guangdong, intending to transport it to various places for sale. Therefore, the Anti-Smoking Committee requested the Executive Yuan to establish inspection offices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian, but the implementation has not been very satisfactory. The domestic society and people have expressed suspicion and opposition. Later, the Anti-Smoking Committee, fearing that it would cause abuses, again requested the Executive Yuan to issue an order to abolish the inspection offices in various places. This matter has come to an end. The central government's established anti-smoking policy is unwavering. This time, due to the poor handling of the matter by the people in charge, the people have been suspicious, which shows that the people's expressions can be of great help to politics. The government will correct its political measures if it feels they are not entirely appropriate, and it can obtain the understanding of the people. The Fourth Plenary Session decided on four major tasks: cutting likin, suppressing bandits, eliminating communists, and prohibiting smoking. The first three items have been actively pursued, and cutting likin has already been achieved. As for the prohibition of smoking, the central government has not relaxed. The policy has not changed. This time, the establishment of the inspection office, or the comrades responsible for the prohibition of smoking, had different views, resulting in this organization. However, due to opposition from all sides, it was resolutely canceled to seek improvement. Since the Opium War a century ago, the people of the country have suffered deeply. Therefore, everyone advocates prohibition. The government is also absolutely responsible for handling it. Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament states: "The opium business can absolutely not coexist with the national government empowered by the people." At the National Anti-Smoking Conference in the 17th year, Chairman Chiang also expressed that the national government would never take a penny from opium. The people can supervise this. From the government's responsibility and Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament, the government will not change its anti-smoking purpose, compromise with opium, or say that China's finances are difficult, but can find ways in other areas, such as increasing the salt tax, which is much better. Increasing taxes will only make the people bear a little more tax burden, but it will not harm the future of the people or the nation. Otherwise, dyeing the national flag of the blue sky, white sun with the color of opium would be tearing up the spirit of the revolution and causing the nation to perish. The work of construction can be divided into two categories: active and passive. First, the active aspect is construction, which should focus on maintaining the lives of the people and the lives of the nation. Otherwise, even if education and livelihoods are well-managed, they will not last. Second, the passive aspect is eliminating harm. If opium cannot be prohibited, even if suppressing bandits is done, the people will not be able to have lasting peace. Now, the government is actively working on the four major tasks of the Fourth Plenary Session, such as cutting likin, suppressing bandits, and eliminating communists. It is also actively working on the prohibition of smoking to protect the lives of the people and consolidate the foundation of the country. In the past few weeks, due to the expression of opinions by the people, the central government has already canceled the inspection office. Some people in society still suspect that the government will change the name and continue to do so. The government's comrades responsible have stated that the prohibition of smoking is a determined purpose and will be firmly implemented. There will be no state trafficking or selling. Only in this way can we be worthy of the people who have been punished for anti-smoking laws. Some provinces have executed death sentences for smoking offenders, and they are still continuing to execute them. If the government is now easing up on the prohibition of smoking, those who were punished in the past would be wronged, and the government would be unfair. The revolutionary government, in order to establish itself in the world and show the spirit of a newly emerging country, should actively eliminate opium and complete the cause of saving the country. If there are still doubters, the government's responsible comrades should clearly state that the government is responsible for prohibiting smoking and will continue to do so according to the previous methods, and the criminal law and anti-smoking law cannot be changed during the period of implementation, and the anti-smoking laws cannot be changed by the second method. This can be told to the whole country, etc.</p>
<h3>Li Shuhua, Gu Zhutong, and Others Take Office as Ministers and Army Commanders</h3>
<p>Chen Bulei and Qian Changzhao Take Office as Deputy Ministers of Education</p>
<p>Zhao Qilu and Li Yannian Take Office as Commanders of the Garrison Division</p>
<p>Acting Minister of Education Li Shuhua, Deputy Ministers Chen Bulei and Qian Changzhao, National Government Guard Army Commander and Commander of the First Division Gu Zhutong, Deputy Commander of the First Division Zhao Qilu, and Deputy Commander of the Second Division Li Yannian held an oath-taking ceremony on the morning of the 13th after the National Government Memorial Week. Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Peide, Shao Lizi, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Boqun, Ye Chucang, and representatives of government officials and various agencies, totaling over 300 people, attended. Yu Youren presided. After the ceremony, the seal-giving ceremony was held first. Chairman Yu Youren presented the seals. The Minister of Education and the Commander of the Guard Army took the seals in turn. Next, the oath-taking ceremony was held. Central Committee member Cai Yuanpei supervised the oath-taking. After each person taking the oath raised their right hand and swore, the supervisor Cai Yuanpei gave a speech, roughly saying that the education cause is related to the fundamental plan of the country and should be promoted as soon as possible. Minister Li has a solid background in scientific research and will be able to use scientific methods to promote it after taking office. Deputy Minister Chen has written many articles and is a very meticulous person. His performance as the Director of the Education Department in Zhejiang was particularly good. Deputy Minister Qian has a deep understanding of political science and has made many contributions to education. It is hoped that after taking office, everyone will find ways to improve the education cause that has already been done and actively handle those that have not been done. The Guard Army is a model for the national army. Commander Gu has been working hard for the revolution for a long time. After taking office, he will be able to follow the oath, implement the defense of the country, and love the people. Chairman Yu Youren then gave a speech, roughly saying that since the Fourth Plenary Session, the government has paid extraordinary attention to the education cause, and educational reform is urgent. Therefore, the President of the Executive Yuan himself serves as Minister, which shows the government's emphasis on education. Minister Li has worked in the government for a long time, and his past work has been very diligent. This time, he is taking on the post of Minister and will be able to live up to the expectations of the national education community. Since the rise of the revolutionary army, there has been no actual reform of education. When Chairman Chiang served as Minister, although he had the intention of reform, he was unable to carry it out effectively due to the circumstances. However, the revolutionary cause is closely related to education. Therefore, the ability to succeed in education, reform, and construction is true success, true reform, and true construction. I hope that all comrades will strive to achieve the goal of actual reform. Commander Gu and the two division commanders Zhao and Li have been following the Commander-in-Chief for a long time. Commander Gu has put in a lot of effort in the revolutionary process. After taking office as Army Commander this time, he will be able to follow the great, strong, and healthy spirit and personality of the Commander-in-Chief, work hard, and make the army a model for the national army and make himself a model for soldiers. Next, Director of Education Li Shuhua replied, roughly saying that he will respectfully accept the speech of the Central Representative and Chairman. However, I am weak and incompetent and cannot be qualified for the job. I have repeatedly resigned to Chairman Chiang, but he did not allow it. Therefore, I will make an effort to take on the role. Education is the fundamental plan of the country, especially during the period of political tutelage, which is extremely important. In the future, I will follow Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament, the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage, the education facilities orientation plan decided by the National Assembly, and the aim of education of the Republic of China, under the guidance of the Party and the government, and the established regulations when Chairman Chiang served as Minister, and work hard on educational construction and improvement. I also hope that government comrades will provide guidance from time to time. Finally, Gu Zhutong replied, saying that after taking office, he will follow the instructions and work hard. After the reply, the ceremony was completed and the participants dispersed after taking a photo.</p>

<h3>Kidnappers in Little Kunshan Arrested and Interrogated</h3>
<p>Kidnapping cases have occurred in Little Kunshan. The County Public Security Bureau dispatched inspector Yang Shijie to secretly investigate. The night before, they received a report from a local informant named Xiao Zhou and arrested Ruan A'san (also known as Big Foot A'san), Xu Maozi, and Yang Xiaoxiang. They were taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation and confessed to the kidnapping of a person surnamed Da Pukang, Pan Fengde of Xi Jinggang, and a person surnamed Zhu of Mo Jiabang, and that they had all received a share of the loot. However, because the bandits' weapons had not been recovered, Inspector Yang received a secret order to continue searching in the countryside.</p>

<h3>Third Mass Escape from the Reformatory</h3>
<p>Due to poor management by the director Wang Yinruo, the Reformatory on 530 Road has already experienced two mass escapes of detainees. Unexpectedly, at 7:30 PM on the 12th, a third escape occurred. Taking advantage of the light rain, the detainees dug through the wall and escaped. By the time the guards found out and stopped them, 24 people had escaped. The Public Security Bureau was immediately notified and ordered to search for them. Seven people were apprehended at various locations outside Changmen and sent back to the facility for detention. The remaining escapees are still being searched for.</p>
<h3>Collapse of the Old Changmen City Wall</h3>
<p>The Suzhou city wall has been in disrepair for many years, and several sections are in a dangerous state. Yesterday (13th) at around 9:00 AM, the city wall near Tongzimen north of Old Changmen suddenly collapsed for about three zhang due to continuous heavy rain. The buildings of the Huaqingchi bathhouse near the city wall were also partially crushed. The police district in charge reported to the Public Security Bureau, which informed the Construction Bureau to repair it as soon as possible to strengthen the city's defense.</p>
<h3>Chartered Steamship Temporarily Suspended</h3>

<h3>Thief Commits Arson in Attempt to Burn Down Lumber Company</h3>
<p>Ling Ju-xing Lumber Company, located at the foot of the West City in Wuxi County, is known for its prosperous business. Around 9 o'clock the night before last, a thief surreptitiously entered through the back door and stole a coat and a flashlight. Before leaving, the thief set fire to a lean-to in the back, causing a sudden explosion of smoke and flames. Fortunately, the company employees noticed the fire and called for help. Various fire brigades arrived promptly and worked diligently to extinguish the blaze. However, the lean-to was completely destroyed by the fire.</p>
<h3>Telephone Lines to Four Rural Townships Scheduled for Installation Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Mao Feng, Director of the Wuxi County Construction Bureau, appointed Bei Qian as the telephone commissioner. Recently, Commissioner Bei resigned to take on another role and has submitted his resignation to Director Mao. Sun Jian, Director of the Department of Construction, appointed Yuan Fengxiang, a section member and engineer from the Telecommunications Administration Office's First Section, to come to Wuxi and take over the position. After being appointed, Yuan arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday and met with Director Mao and Commissioner Zang the following day to discuss the implementation plan. Currently, a portion of the workers has already arrived in Wuxi from the town. The groundbreaking date is scheduled for the 15th, with the starting point for planting the poles being behind the Railway Hotel. Once the lines to the four rural townships are installed, they will be connected to the exchange.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<h3>Opium Smuggling in Broad Daylight Amidst Anti-Smoking Campaign</h3>
<p>Jiangyin is located on the Yangtze River and has always been known as an opium distribution center. Since the establishment of the Anti-Smoking Investigation Office, all sectors opposed it as being akin to a state-run opium monopoly. The Executive Yuan ordered its dissolution, and Shi Yunting, the Jiangyin Anti-Smoking Commissioner, has already concluded his work. However, the Northern Outer Investigation Office remains in existence, with rumors of reorganization. Amidst this anti-smoking campaign, on the morning of the 11th, a boat from Taizi in Jiangbei arrived at the Pu Hui Bridge outside the North Gate carrying a large quantity of opium, approximately 200 catties. The opium was unloaded publicly at the location, with armed guards providing protection. It is said that the opium was transported to Hexi and Junshan Lane.</p>
<h3>Catholic Church Encroachment on Canal Land</h3>
<p>On March 2, 1928, the Qingyang Catholic Church built a revetment that encroached on the canal. Local groups repeatedly opposed this, and the county government ordered the church to demolish the structure and restore the land, but the order has not been followed for nearly three years. Recently, Liu Chongyi, a representative of the church, filed an appeal with the Construction Department. The Construction Department decided that the church should demolish two feet of the structure. Qingyang party and government agencies believe that an appeal can only be filed within 30 days of the issuance of a disposal order. The county government's order to the church to demolish the structure was issued more than two years ago. The basis upon which the Construction Department accepted this appeal is questionable. Furthermore, when the Construction Bureau went to the countryside to measure the canal, it based its measurements on the dimensions of the old canal engineering drawings, confirming that the church had encroached on the canal by seven or eight feet. The villagers continue to oppose this and have also requested that the relevant authorities file an appeal.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<h3>Two Kidnappers Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Jing Peiyin, the son of a wealthy resident of Dingqiao Town in Danyang, Jing Jisheng, was kidnapped on February 9, 1929, while studying at a school in Wujin County. After school, on his way home, he was abducted by bandits. He was later killed when a ransom of 25,000 yuan was not paid. In March of the same year, Qi Zhihai, the son of Qi Qianlin from Xuanjiazhuang in the Third District of Wuyi County, was kidnapped while teaching in the village. He cried for help along the way and was shot by the bandits, dying shortly thereafter. Eight kidnappers involved in both cases, including Yuan Xiaoheshang and Wu Bolin, were apprehended by the Wudan Joint Defense Association, handed over to the county and transferred to the county court. After trial, Yuan Xiaoheshang and Wu Bolin were sentenced to death. The sentence was submitted to the Higher Court of Tian, and then reported to the provincial government for approval. Upon receiving the order, the county court retrieved the two convicts from prison at around 1 p.m. on the 12th, verified their identities, and dispatched police to take them to Fengweidun for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Stone Pillar Collapses, Crushing Boat Crew Member</h3>
<p>On the 12th, a coal boat (owned by Zhao Hongtai) arrived at the Twelve-Bay area outside the West Gate of Wuyi County, across the river from the Great King Temple, having loaded coal in Shandong for unloading in Wuxi. During its return journey and passing through the area, it prepared to stop and rest. Crew member Liu Xitong, due to the strong winds and waves causing the boat to rock, tied one end of a rope to the boat and the other end to a stone pillar standing on the shore. Unfortunately, at that moment, the stone pillar collapsed, and Liu Xitong's legs were crushed beneath the pillar, while his head was submerged in the water. By the time the boat owner went to rescue him, Liu had already died.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<h3>Various Agencies Compete for Jiedi Nunnery</h3>
<p>The Jiedi Nunnery, located at Gangzixia outside the South Gate of the county, is involved in a murder case and legal proceedings. The abbess, Decheng, has fled, and the nunnery site is abandoned and dilapidated due to the lack of management. Local agencies and organizations, seeking office space or locations for public undertakings due to inadequate facilities or difficulty finding premises, all intend to temporarily use the nunnery. Previously, the county-run Forest Farm had requested the county to designate the nunnery as its office after the murder case occurred. Subsequently, the Buddhist Association, based on letters from citizens, stated that the nunnery was unattended after Decheng's departure and requested that a monk be appointed to take charge. After discussion, it was decided to appoint De Tang, a monk from Jinshan Jiangtian Temple, as the abbot to manage the property. The county government dispatched personnel to investigate and consult with local residents to determine their opinions and report back truthfully for a decision. It is reported that in addition to the Forest Farm's intention to temporarily use the nunnery site, the Education Bureau intends to use it to establish a small school, the Security Corps intends to use it to establish a branch, and the First Autonomous Division intends to use it for offices. The final disposition of the nunnery will depend on the consensus of local residents and the approval of the county magistrate.</p>

<h3>Request to Arrest Liu Minzhai</h3>
<p>Deng, the Director of the Jinan Salt Field, reported that the Yu Tong Salt Company's field stores were facing starvation due to the failure of the Yangzhou manager, Liu Minzhai, to provide relief, which led to a violent uprising. The report was submitted to Wang Zhanghu, the Director of the Lianghuai Salt Transport Department, who then telegraphed the Jiangdu County government yesterday to arrest Liu nearby and force him to remit the withheld funds to the field to alleviate the crisis.</p>
<h3>Teachers and Staff to Again Jointly Demand Salaries</h3>
<p>Jiangdu's education funding has been in arrears for several months. County Magistrate Chen initially planned to issue 60,000 yuan in loan certificates in the hope of settling accounts with teachers and staff by July 15 to clear the arrears. Today is the 13th, and the teachers and staff, seeing no progress, convened a meeting today to inquire with the county government and education bureau about the situation. However, it is reported that the county government is unable to raise enough funds through loan certificates. Furthermore, the heavy rains this week have blocked roads, preventing the collection of taxes and levies. The previously scheduled July 15 settlement is unlikely to occur.</p>
<h3>City Wall Collapses, Injuring Elderly Woman</h3>
<p>After more than ten days of continuous rain, the streets and alleys are flooded, and the disaster in the southern countryside is expanding. Xuejiazhai, Diaojiamiao, Qinqiaqiao, Xinhewan, Xifangqiao, and Dongjiatao dikes have all been submerged. The high-lying fields in the northwest and the early rice in the eastern countryside have also been inundated by the rain, and countless walls and houses have collapsed. Many villagers have come to the city to report the disaster. Yesterday (the 11th), the county ordered the Finance Bureau to investigate. Furthermore, yesterday afternoon (the 12th), several tens of yards of the city wall behind the electric plant outside the Customs Gate collapsed, crushing several nearby thatched houses and injuring an elderly woman.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<h3>Severe Storm Causes Drastic Riverbank Collapse</h3>
<p>The continuous wind and rain in Tongyi have caused the collapse of dikes and embankments along the river, with the erosion being extremely severe. To protect against tidal surges, the dikes rely on retreating banks. The Construction Department has approved the local request to establish the Lower Yangtze Northern Bank Erosion Prevention Association in Tongyi to plan and implement erosion prevention projects. The required funding, in addition to provincial and county allocations, will also be requested from the National Government for subsidies. Currently, the emergency reinforcement project for the Jiang'an Riverbank at the junction of Tong and Ru is being handled by the Construction Bureau.</p>
<h3>Relief Center Requests Levy on Feast Donations</h3>
<p>The Nantong Relief Center was previously ordered by the province to allocate Zhang Qian's assets as operating funds. Now that all of Zhang's assets have been returned, a request has been submitted to the county government for onward transmission to the province to approve the levy of 2% on feast donations to fund the vocational training center for vagrants.</p>

<p>Yang Xilao, the chairman of the Zhapu Town Chamber of Commerce, submitted a report to the county government stating that after the Zhapu Guangji Pawnshop was looted by mutinous soldiers, the Chamber of Commerce dispatched Ye Liangfu and others to the pawnshop for inventory. A total of 136 items were stolen, with a total loan value of 447.8 yuan. The pawnshop has submitted a detailed list. After investigation, all of the stolen items belonged to pledgers and were not yet due. The report requested instructions from the county government to report to the province for guidance on how to handle the matter. The county government has submitted the report to the province for review. In the meantime, a notice has been posted stating that until further instructions are received from the province, pledgers are not allowed to cause any disturbances when the pawnshop reopens.</p>

<h3>Conditions of the Bengbu Flood</h3>
<p>Since the onset of the rainy season, continuous heavy rain has caused the Zhun River to rise sharply, almost reaching the banks. A section of the dike on the north bank of the Hebei River collapsed yesterday due to the flood, resulting in widespread flooding. The waves in the river are turbulent, capsizing several small boats. The Xiaobengbu area of Hebei is entirely submerged in water. The Eastern Playground and the northern ends of Guozhi Street and Guoqing Street in the city center are several feet deep in water, and most of the houses have been flooded. Hundreds of thatched houses have collapsed, with small boats floating among them, ferrying refugees. The Yongji Pawnshop at the northern end of Guozhi Street is several feet deep in water, and the wooden shelves and pledged clothing have been soaked. Pawn operations have been suspended immediately. The area around the Western Playground, near the boat pond, is even more severely flooded, with the low-lying areas turned into swamps. Small boats are navigating the area as if it were a lake. The New Great Road and the Ma'anzha on Taiping Street and Zhongzheng Street are flooded, with shops on both sides submerged. Laborers wade through the water, with the shallow areas reaching their knees and the deeper areas reaching their waists. The water is several feet deep at the floor of the Telegraph Bureau on Mujang Street, making it impossible for the staff to stay. The office was temporarily moved to the Dongya Hotel on Erma Street yesterday. The district branches of the Public Security Bureau surveyed the flood victims and counted more than 5,500 people. The victims in Hebei were not included in this count, and the total is estimated to be more than 7,000, displaced and in dire need of assistance. The Public Security Bureau, recognizing the severity of the disaster and the refugees' desperate need for food, initiated a relief effort and convened a meeting of all sectors at the bureau at 3 p.m. on the 11th to discuss relief measures, resulting in four resolutions.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Prosecutor Da Shiying of the Wuhu District Court</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing regarding an article in the "Foreign News" section of your newspaper on July 4 entitled "Major Uproar in Wuhu Legal Circles," which contains many inaccuracies. I am writing to request corrections to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The cases involving the assault on Xu Shaolou and the injuries to Peng Qingsong at the Star Theater were both handled by Prosecutor Pei and have no connection to me. It is inappropriate to list Pei Xiyu and Da Shiying together. This is the first correction I request.</p>
<p>(2) Li Weixin was a judge in the Wuhu court before and worked with me for only ten days in June of last year before being transferred. I have never met Yu Hongming. There is no possibility of collusion. This is the second correction I request.</p>
<p>(3) With regard to the proposal by lawyer Sheng Liangzu that Han Lantian be investigated for bribery in connection with opium trafficking, I have already submitted a request to higher authorities to thoroughly investigate whether there was any bribery. The truth will eventually come out. Until the investigation is complete, no one should be arbitrarily slandered. This is the third correction I request.</p>
<p>Your newspaper is a model for the press, and I am concerned about the potential for confusion. Therefore, I am writing to request that you investigate and make the necessary corrections. I offer my sincere regards.</p>
<p>Da Shiying, Prosecutor of the Wuhu District Court, July 11</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education Submits Report to Ministry on Results of Provisional Standards for Elementary School Curriculum Trial</h3>
<p>The provisional standards for primary and secondary school curricula have been in effect for over a year since the Ministry of Education promulgated the trial requirement. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education established a Research Committee on Primary and Secondary School Curriculum Standards. The bureau has convened meetings to discuss the results of the trial and has compiled the reports from various primary and secondary schools in the city. The elementary school portion has now been completed and submitted to the ministry. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Report on the Results of the Trial of Provisional Standards for Elementary School Curriculum in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Chinese Language</h3>
<p>丨Teaching Time丨</p>
<p>(1) The weekly teaching time for Chinese language in each grade of elementary school seems too short and should be increased appropriately. "Reason": Following the teaching time stipulated in the provisional standards, the minimum requirements were often not met by the end of the curriculum.</p>
<p>丨Assignment Requirements丨</p>
<p>(1) The requirement to learn simplified running script in the writing section of Chinese language for grades three and four should be deleted. "Reason": 1. Children in grades three and four have not yet mastered regular script, and practicing running script will hinder their progress in regular script. 2. Children in grades three and four do not have a clear understanding of the shape of regular script characters. Learning running script will reduce the accuracy of their writing of regular script (Fifth-grade children make more mistakes after learning running script than before. This is true for fifth-grade children, let alone third and fourth-grade children).</p>
<p>(2) Learning running script should be moved to grades five and six.</p>
<p>(3) In the Chinese language assignment requirements for the third grade, the only aspect students focus on is the type of character. According to the teachers, in addition to the type of character, students should also pay attention to the writing tool used. There are two main types:</p>
<p>1. Soft brush. 2. Hard pen. Soft brush refers to the traditional brush, while hard pen refers to fountain pens, pencils, etc. Elementary schools often think that formal writing refers only to learning with a soft brush, which is a traditional habit. The reason for writing in elementary school is that it is necessary for life in society. In the past, the need was for characters written with soft brushes (i.e., brush calligraphy), but the current need is for characters written with hard pens. If we continue to teach writing as before, using only soft brushes and not hard pens, it would be a serious mistake. Although the learning of regular, semi-cursive, small characters in elementary Chinese writing does not explicitly limit the use of a specific soft or hard pen, it can be freely used. However, to prevent misunderstanding and for clarity, the writing tool should also be specified. The writing requirements for each grade can be modified as follows:</p>
<p>1. First and second grades: 1. The original "writing of announcements and signs" can be changed to "writing of announcements and signs with soft or hard pen." 2. The original "practice of writing simple familiar characters" can be changed to "practice of writing simple familiar characters with soft or hard pen." 3. The original "design practice of other writing" can be changed to "design practice of other calligraphy with soft or hard pen."</p>
<p>2. Third and fourth grades: 1. The original "writing of announcements, signs, letters, and notes, etc." can be changed to "writing of announcements, signs, letters, and notes, etc. with soft or hard pen." 2. The original "practice of regular script middle characters" can be changed to "practice of regular script middle characters with soft brush" and "practice of regular script small characters with soft or hard pen." 3. The original "learning to write simple running script" can be changed to "learning to write simple running script with soft or hard pen."</p>
<p>3. Fifth and sixth grades: 1. The original "writing of practical texts" can be changed to "writing of practical texts with soft or hard pen." 2. The original is the same as the second item for the third and fourth grades, so the modification can be the same. 3. The original "practice of writing simple running script middle and small characters" can be changed to "practice of writing simple running script middle characters with soft brush" and "practice of writing simple running script small characters with soft or hard pen." In short, the words "soft brush" or "hard pen" should be added to words like "practice" and "learn." Otherwise, it should be noted in the annotations.</p>
<p>(4) Recognition of common simplified, irregular, and seal script characters should be moved to grades five and six. Children in grades three and four do not yet have a correct understanding of characters and should focus on simplicity and avoid complexity.</p>
<p>(5) The "recognition of phonetic symbols" should be added to the assignment requirements for reading in the first and second grades. "Reason": Phonetic symbols are an important tool for helping to recognize Chinese characters. Based on the actual situation, children in grades one and two are already able to recognize them.</p>
<p>丨Minimum Standard丨</p>
<p>(1) The "ability to write running script" should be removed from the minimum standard for the primary level.</p>
<h3>Party Doctrine</h3>
<p>(1) Party doctrine in lower grades can be combined with society and nature to form a "common sense" subject. "Reason": The general explanation contains a clause that includes teaching material on the Three Principles of the People, which is quite broad. If party doctrine is made an independent subject with systematic study, it would be too far removed from children's experiences. If teaching materials are selected based on children's needs, it will conflict with other subjects.</p>
<h3>Social Studies</h3>
<p>丨Assignment Requirements丨</p>
<p>(1) A career guidance item should be added to the social studies assignment requirements for the higher grades. "Reason": Based on the actual situation, few elementary school graduates continue their education, while many enter the workforce. Therefore, career guidance should be provided to prepare them for employment.</p>
<p>丨Minimum Standard丨</p>
<p>(1) The provisional curriculum standards state that "except for party doctrine, which is administered by the Central Party Department's Training Department, the remaining subjects are drafted, compiled, and organized by experts commissioned by the Ministry of Education's Primary and Secondary School Curriculum Standards Drafting Committee." Based on this, party doctrine is a separate subject equal to social studies and is not included within social studies.</p>
<p>The social studies minimum standard for the fifth grade, (1) the end of the primary level, includes "(4) the key points of practicing four rights... (5) understanding the key points of five rights and four rights." According to teachers, these materials should be placed in party doctrine and not mixed into social studies. Strictly speaking, party doctrine is a kind of social studies, but now we are building the country based on the Three Principles of the People, which is more important than any other subject. Because it is important, it should be separated from social studies to become an independent subject for special study. Since party doctrine is separated from social studies to become an independent subject for special study, all content related to party doctrine should be placed within the scope of party doctrine to avoid confusion and repetition.</p>
<p>The following should be added to the requirements for senior graduation: "Understanding the general situation of the world's countries and China's position in the world."</p>
<h3>Arithmetic</h3>
<p>丨Assignment Requirements丨</p>
<p>(1) Proficiency in arithmetic, whether through written calculation or abacus, requires continuous practice over a long period. The weekly time allocated in the assignment requirements for the higher grades is actually too short.</p>
<p>(2) In the arithmetic requirements for the first and second grades, the recognition of days, weeks, months, and years should be moved to at least the sixth item, "Recognition of numbers 10 to 19," with the exception of the week item. Because the numbers used to represent days, months, and years are often greater than the numbers 1 to 9.</p>
<p>(3) Simple bookkeeping (for personal and family use) should be added to the assignment requirements for the third and fourth grades. "Reason": To enable children to understand the use and recording methods of accounting books.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding arithmetic, (1) The meaning of terms such as square inch, square foot, cubic inch, cubic foot, etc., are difficult for children to understand. According to teachers, the teaching material related to squares in the arithmetic assignment requirements for the third grade should be moved from the first and second grades to the third and fourth grades. The teaching material related to cubes should be moved from the third and fourth grades to the fifth and sixth grades.</p>
<p>丨Key Points of Teaching Method丨</p>
<p>(1) Teaching abacus and written calculation separately is better than teaching them together. "Reason": (1) Learning the abacus is more difficult than learning written calculation. (2) It is inconvenient to have an abacus on the desk while learning. (3) It is not easy for teachers to identify children's mistakes when learning abacus and written calculation at the same time.</p>
<h3>Practical Arts</h3>
<p>丨Assignment Categories丨</p>
<p>The second assignment category of elementary school practical arts is divided into (1) school affairs, (2) household chores, (3) agricultural affairs, (4) crafts, and (5) business conditions, encompassing agriculture, industry, commerce, and academics. In terms of content, it can be said to be extremely complete. In terms of scope, it can be said to be extremely broad. However, it is difficult to hire a teacher capable of handling such a wide range of tasks. If the tasks are assigned separately, elementary school courses will become more scattered than before, which is contrary to the original intention of compiling the curriculum standards.</p>
<p>丨Difficult Problems with Practical Arts丨</p>
<p>It is difficult to investigate the results of household chores and family operations, and the results obtained are not accurate. Cooking practice is difficult to maintain order due to the large number of students and the insufficient supply of utensils. Furthermore, animal husbandry and crop cultivation are difficult to implement due to limited school grounds.</p>
<h3>Nature Studies</h3>
<p>丨Minimum Standard丨</p>
<p>(1) The fifth minimum standard of elementary nature study, (1) at the end of the primary level, "(2) understanding the general function of various daily necessities for clothing, food, housing, and transportation" includes many various daily necessities for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. It seems a little too advanced to understand all of them at the end of the primary level. According to the teachers, this item can refer to the method of "(3) having more than eight good hygiene habits" and limit the number to be more appropriate.</p>
<p>(2) The fifth minimum standard of elementary nature study, (2) there are a total of seven items for senior graduation. Among the seven items, only (1) and (2) are related to nature, while (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) are related to hygiene. Formally, it seems to be too biased toward hygiene. According to the teachers, another item can be added to the nature aspect, which is to understand the general functions of the various daily necessities for clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and increase the number compared to the end of the primary level, referring to the method of good hygiene habits.</p>
<h3>Music Department</h3>
<p>丨Work Items丨</p>
<p>(1) In the first and second grades, it is advisable to add the recognition of "preliminary music flashcards" to the practice items. Because students in the first and second grades basically do not use musical scores when singing, they must at least have a preliminary understanding of the musical score so as to prepare for sight-singing in the third and fourth grades. As for the flashcards, the teacher should make them by himself, for example, write 丨 on the front and a quarter note on the back, etc.</p>
<p>丨There are three points about music丨</p>
<p>(2) The reading method of the Gongche notation and the beat can be changed to the fifth grade, and combined with the teaching of playing Chinese musical instruments. Children in the third and fourth grades are just beginning to practice reading regular scores, and they really don't have the energy and time to study the Gongche notation. If it is changed to the fifth grade to study, it can be combined with the performance of Chinese music, on the one hand to make children feel the need to learn, and on the other hand to give children the opportunity to apply and practice.</p>
<p>(3) Two-part rounds can be practiced earlier. Two-part round practice is not a difficult task, and can be started as early as the third and fourth grades to increase children's interest in music. Undoubtedly, children will be incredibly excited to hear this novel way of singing and beautiful harmony.</p>
<p>(4) The performance of Chinese musical instruments should be included in the practice column of the work items for the fifth and sixth grades. Playing Chinese musical instruments is indeed a matter that primary school students should practice. Even the minimum and maximum graduation standards stipulated in the standard clearly state that they should be able to use two or more kinds of Chinese musical instruments, but not a single sentence is mentioned in the work items. It is best to add it.</p>
<h3>Physical Education Department</h3>
<p>丨Work Category丨</p>
<p>Extracurricular activities are best not held at noon, because it is too close to lunchtime, which is not very suitable for hygiene.</p>
<p>丨Work Items for Each Grade丨</p>
<p>In the third and fourth grade sports item, there are simple ball sports, so simple track and field sports can of course also be included.</p>
<p>丨Key Points of Teaching Methods丨</p>
<p>1.  The race distances in the athletes' sports meet item list still use the yard system. It is found that the World Far East National University and Middle School Games have all been changed to the metric system. For the sake of consistent connection, it is necessary to change yards to meters. 2. The low hurdle should be set at 110 meters. It has been found to be applicable after experiments in the Shanghai City Primary School Joint Sports Meet. However, Group B seems to be canceled.</p>
<h3>Subject Combination</h3>
<p>1.  Music and Physical Education, 2. Crafts and Art, 3. Personal Hygiene and Public Hygiene.</p>
<p>(1) Music and physical education in lower grades can be combined into "singing and games." Teaching music and physical education as two separate subjects in lower grades is too uninteresting and boring. It seems necessary to combine them in accordance with the principle that primary school subjects should not be too numerous.</p>
<p>(2) Combining crafts and art teaching in lower grades is more convenient. "Reason": In order to facilitate production in lower-grade crafts, it is necessary to first understand the concept of image. On the one hand, it is easy to arouse interest in studying art, and on the other hand, it can be applied to production. The combination of the two sides is more interesting, so it seems more convenient to combine teaching.</p>
<p>(3) Personal hygiene and public hygiene should be combined for teaching, which is more convenient.</p>
<p>"Reasons": 1. In this standard, the personal hygiene item belongs to the natural science subject, and the public hygiene belongs to the social science subject. Since the experiment, it has been found that personal hygiene and public hygiene are related everywhere. It is quite inconvenient to teach them separately. 2. The people of our country have always neglected hygiene. Elementary education should try its best to instill and cultivate knowledge and habits of hygiene. Now that it is divided into natural and social sciences for teaching, it is inevitable that there will be some bias, which is not the way to pay attention to hygiene.</p>
<p>"Measures": 1. Public hygiene in social science is incorporated into the natural science under the hygiene intelligence item. Teaching is combined with geography and history, called social science. Combined with natural phenomena, life needs, and hygiene intelligence (public hygiene and personal hygiene), it is called natural science. The amount of time is changed to:</p>
<p>Natural lower grade 120 minutes, middle grade 150 minutes, higher grade 180 minutes.</p>
<p>Social lower grade 60 minutes, middle grade 90 minutes, higher grade 150 minutes.</p>
<p>2. The public hygiene in social science and the personal hygiene in natural science are separated and combined, called hygiene. A special subject is set up, and the weekly teaching time for each grade is set at 60 minutes. (End)</p>

The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>County Education Director Resigns and Retains</h3>
<p>Shi She (Yang Yong), Director of the Shanghai County Education Bureau, recently submitted a request to the county government to resign due to physical weakness and limited talent, so as to recuperate. County Magistrate Yan instructed yesterday after receiving the report, saying that the director has been acting as the director for two years, and his work has been serious and his hard work has been very obvious. He is now submitting a request to the Education Department for formal appointment to commend his hard work and benefit education. How can he suddenly have the idea of resigning? The request to resign should not be discussed and should still be reported after receiving instructions from the Education Department.</p>
<h3>Hanyang Arsenal Specialist Examination Officer Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Hanyang Arsenal Specialist School of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs is the only institution in China that studies arsenal science. The curriculum is perfect and the cost is extremely low. The first batch of graduates have been sent to various arsenals by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, and several students with excellent grades have been sent to study abroad for further study. This summer, it is recruiting the third batch of students. The Shanghai registration office is located at Chizhi College on Jiangwan Road. The examination officers sent by the school, Ouyang Huan, Wang Dezhao, and Li Buhuang, arrived yesterday and stayed at the Huizhong Hotel on Sanma Road. It is reported that the registration deadline was originally set for the 14th, but because it is feared that students from afar will not be able to arrive in time, it has been extended to noon on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Heads of Various Departments of Daxia Middle School High School</h3>
<p>Daxia Middle School on Jiaozhou Road is a complete middle school attached to Daxia University. The teaching management and equipment have always been very substantial.

<h3>Whether My Country's Football Team Will Go to the United States is Undecided</h3>
<p>Inquire by Telegraph Whether the World Association Has Any Football Matches</p>
<p>In recent days, the most interesting topic in the sports world has been that our country will select a football team to attend the World Games next year. The Chinese National Sports Association has confirmed that it will proceed with the preparations, and players from all over the world are also actively preparing. However, according to Mr. Shen Siliang, honorary head of the Sports Association, there is no football program in the World Games in Los Angeles, USA next year, which has caused suspicion. The original intention of our country to send a football team to participate was to take the opportunity to visit the grand event. If there is no football program, then our country's football team will have made a wasted trip. The Sports Association sent a telegram to the organizing committee of the World Games in the United States the day before yesterday to ask for everything, but has not yet received a reply. If there is no football program, then our country's football team may give up going to the United States.</p>

<h3>The Two-Route Machine Affairs Department Sports Meet Held in the Rain</h3>
<p>The Two-Route Machine Affairs Department held its first sports meet in heavy rain on the 12th at the Wusong Public Sports Field. At that time, the track was slippery due to mud, and the sand ponds accumulated water into ditches, resulting in a significant decline in the performance of various events. The records are as follows: 100 meters: Zhou Yufeng, 13.2 seconds; 200 meters: Chen Guanyou, 29 seconds; 400 meters: Li Zisen, 1 minute and 3 seconds; 800 meters: Huang Zhenhua, 2 minutes and 34 seconds; 1500 meters: Huang Zhenhua, 5 minutes and 36 seconds; Low Hurdles: Yan Yougeng, 32 seconds; High Jump: Yan Yougeng, 1.62 meters; Long Jump: Shen Baochang, 5 meters; Triple Jump: Yan Yougeng, 10.40 meters; Discus: Yan Yougeng, 22.70 meters; Shot Put: Zhou Shanyang, 10.90 meters.

<h3>Results of the Shanghai East Open Sports Meet</h3>
<p>The final of the Shanghai East Open Sports Meet was held at 2 pm on the 12th at the Dinghai Road Bridge. The continuous drizzling rain for days caused the track to be loose and wet, which greatly affected the results. The heavy rain in the morning even caused half of the athletes to give up due to insufficient feet, which is especially regrettable. However, the aim of this event is to promote sports in Shanghai East, so that the ladies and gentlemen in Shanghai East who come to visit can get a new image, which may not be a good omen for the future. It is now scheduled to hold an awards ceremony at the Shanghai East Commune at 7:30 tonight. The results of each event are listed below. Field events and hurdles are temporarily omitted due to incomplete equipment and the fact that the athletes are not familiar with them.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Wang Yansong, Zheng Chengqing, Wang Wenhua, Li Yongxiang, Tao Baichuan and other five people were elected as the presidium. The master of ceremonies was Xu Yefu, and the recorders were Xue Guangqian and Zhao Shusen. Chairman Zheng Chengqing reported that, everyone, today all circles in this city are holding an anti-Japanese aid overseas Chinese congress to discuss the Wanbaoshan case and the Korean massacre of overseas Chinese. Brothers feel very sad. The occurrence of the Wanbaoshan case, on the surface, was caused by a very small reason, arising from the Korean people's strong planting of paddy fields. However, upon closer observation, it was the beginning of the Japanese imperialism's implementation of the active policy of Manchuria and Mongolia. Observing its every move to instigate the Korean people's violence, there was sufficient preparation beforehand and a consistent policy afterwards. As for why the Japanese imperialism dared to risk the world's disapproval and easily stirred up disputes between China and Japan, as seen by brothers, there are four major long-term causes: (1) Changes in diplomatic policy. When Shidehara first took office as Foreign Minister, his diplomatic policy towards China was a stable diplomacy, expressing goodwill towards China everywhere. Later, he was fiercely attacked by the domestic opposition party, accusing him of being weak and incompetent. In order to cater to the people's hearts and ease the opposition, the diplomatic policy towards China was changed to active aggression. (2) Dealing with the Soviet Russia's Five-Year Plan. The Soviet Russia's Five-Year Plan is no different from a plan to fight against Japan. In order to prepare to deal with it, Japan had to first seek to seize the Northeast and make arrangements in advance. Therefore, it used the Wanbaoshan case as an excuse to send troops to the Northeast to fulfill its ambitions. (3) Alienating the feelings between China and Korea. China and Japan will inevitably have a war. If the Korean people's hearts are not towards Japan, when Japan sends troops to the East Province, the Korean people will create disturbances and rebellions in the rear, attacking from both sides, which will be enough to put the Japanese people to death. Therefore, they do not hesitate to alienate and provoke from the side, creating deep-seated animosity between the two sides, with no opportunity to join hands and help each other. (4) Relieving domestic unemployment problems. The state of Japan's recession is known to all. Recently, in order to relieve domestic unemployment problems, they have driven the Korean people to our Northeast territory and transplanted their people to Korea. Based on the above reasons, it can be seen that the Wanbaoshan and Korean cases are actually the background of the Japanese people's violence, and their nature is more serious than the Jinan Massacre. However, the diplomatic authorities of our country clearly know that the incident has expanded and the situation is serious. Although protests have been filed, the results are still unknown. If the victims were easily replaced by the people of other countries, their respective governments would have not only filed serious protests long ago, but also sent troops to protect them. Now that the matter is so serious, and the lives of overseas Chinese are so precarious, according to reports, in Seoul, Incheon, Pyongyang, Sinuiju, and other places in Korea, Korean rioters have expelled overseas Chinese from the country, and countless old and young overseas Chinese have died and been injured. The Japanese police have claimed that they cannot be responsible for local security. Overseas Chinese have left the country to return to their homeland. As of the day before yesterday, more than 5,000 people have entered the country through Andong, and more than 10,000 other refugees have wandered and sought refuge, extremely embarrassed. How should we feel about this situation? On the one hand, we still hope that the government will implement the diplomacy of the association and seriously negotiate with Japan. On the other hand, the people of the country should rise up together, with one heart and one mind, to be the backing of the government's negotiations, and immediately engage in economic severance with the country. Hopefully, all colleagues from all walks of life present will discuss appropriate methods to maintain the lives of overseas Chinese and determine the policy towards Japan.</p>
<h3>Representative Report</h3>
<p>Liu Zihong, representative of the Shanghai Korean Association, reported the process, briefly saying that since the Wanbaoshan incident, the local Japanese military and police not only did not stop the Korean people's violent behavior, but instead opened fire to demonstrate and protect and instigate them to proceed. The Korean people relied on their amulets and acted recklessly. Japanese newspapers deliberately provoked with ulterior motives, which led to the expansion of the storm and spread throughout Korea. General rioters rose up in response, gathered crowds to hate the Chinese, and indulged in ferocity. All Chinese businessmen in major commercial districts such as Seoul, Incheon, Wonsan, Busan, and Pyongyang were harmed together, and their property and lives were destroyed. Deaths and injuries were numerous and tragic. Even cutting hearts and digging eyes, throwing them on the road, all kinds of cruelty, were exhausted. The world was dark, and there was nothing like it in ancient times. The actual situation at that time is recorded below. (1) When the rioters launched an attack on Chinatown in Incheon, the momentum was fierce and extremely critical. Fortunately, the British consul came out to uphold justice and began to restrain the traces. Otherwise, thousands of overseas Chinese in Chinatown would have been spared. (2) When the rioters brutally killed overseas Chinese, there were originally one or two proper Koreans who issued leaflets to persuade them to stop. However, they were prevented from distributing them by the Japanese police, which led to the spread of brutal violence throughout Korea. Then the Japanese people's intention to help evil is self-evident. (3) When the Pyongyang riot was at its worst, overseas Chinese gathered at the station, eager to escape. However, the train refused to load them, which led to no way to escape. Then the Japanese people's prior secret agreement was obvious. (4) When the Wonsan riot was at its most urgent, overseas Chinese also rushed to the station. The station did not issue tickets specifically to the Chinese, and the same was true for ships. Then their intention to put the Chinese to death is beyond doubt. (5) The strangest thing is that at this time, the telegraph of our country and the telegrams from overseas Chinese to our country, although accepted by the country's telegraph bureau, were all shelved and not sent. The telephone of Chinese businessmen was also not connected. It seems that this suppression of news is helping the evil doers. Although the Japanese people want to embellish with sweet words, how can they hide the facts? According to the above, the Japanese military and police, although claiming to provide protection on the surface, actually intended to indulge in private. It has been found that in the Korean riots in 1927, the number of overseas Chinese who were beaten, killed, and lost was countless. As a result of the negotiations, the Japanese government admitted to compensation and apology and other conditions, but has not fulfilled them for several years. Now a tragedy has occurred, which is a hundred times worse than before. The Korean people's cruelty and brutality are indeed visible to all, and the Japanese people's obvious desire to use the Korean people's violence to carry out their plan to expel overseas Chinese is an undeniable fact. If we do not actively negotiate and urge them to realize it, then the third and fourth tragedies after this will not be avoided, and I am afraid that they will be even worse. Colleagues feel deeply peeled and flustered. In addition to requesting the government and various ministries, departments, and party departments to find ways to protect them, we also ask them to submit a serious protest to the Japanese authorities and conduct earnest negotiations. If the goals of punishing murderers, compensating, and apologizing are not achieved, we will never stop. Therefore, I hereby respectfully inform all circles and ask for your prompt and united assistance to save tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Korea from deep waters and scorching fire.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Relief Association issued a declaration stating: "This association confirms that the violent anti-Chinese actions throughout Korea are entirely a manifestation of the Japanese government's active aggression in Manchuria and Mongolia. This is evidenced by the Japanese air force's exercises of defensive warfare in the Dalian area and the Japanese army's readiness along the South Manchurian Railway. Under these severe circumstances, we are deeply saddened by the massacre of our compatriots in Korea. To safeguard the future survival of the Chinese nation, we have unanimously resolved at the general assembly to 'permanently sever economic ties with Japan with a resolute and courageous spirit.' In addition to forming a committee to properly discuss effective measures and petition the Central Party Headquarters to instruct local party headquarters to lead the masses in unified action, we sincerely hope that compatriots throughout the country will rise up together and work together. The survival of the nation depends on this one effort. This declaration is hereby made, hoping for your public awareness."</p>
<h3>Establishing a Committee</h3>
<p>It was resolved to establish a committee to be responsible for this task, named the "Shanghai All Circles Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Relief Committee." Thirty-nine members were determined: nine from the Party Headquarters, eight from the business community, eight from the labor community, two each from the United Citizens' Association, the Education Association, national products organizations, Chinese taxpayer associations, and overseas Chinese organizations, and one each from the agricultural community, the lawyers' association, women's organizations, and news reporters.

<h3>Telegram from Andong</h3>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Trade Union: Our compatriots in Korea have been brutally expelled and massacred. Five thousand have fled to Andong and local donations have been collected for emergency relief. Many are trapped in Korea, with empty possessions and exhausted food. The injured and wounded are still awaiting care. Your association should take the lead and quickly launch an urgent relief effort and telegraph the whole country to set a day of mourning. Andong National Diplomatic Association, Wen.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegram</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing yesterday, saying: "To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, the persecution of overseas Chinese in Korea was caused by the Wanbaoshan Incident, which was caused by the Japanese using Korean farmers to achieve their goal of invading the eastern provinces. Therefore, before the aftermath of the Korean riots has completely subsided, the Japanese already have a plan to move Korean farmers to cultivate land. The matter must be thoroughly resolved, which shows the Japanese conspiracy. Our country's diplomatic response should also pay attention to this point, otherwise, if one miscalculates, it will be too late to regret, and the eastern provinces will be permanently trapped in an irrecoverable situation. According to international practice, although two countries' people are allowed to engage in commercial business within each other's borders, agricultural cultivation of one hectare is generally limited to the people of the country, except for countries such as Argentina and Brazil in South America. There has never been a case where foreigners are allowed to concurrently engage in agricultural cultivation in the host country. Although Koreans have historical relations with China, since they are under Japanese control, they are a separate country. How can they uniquely enjoy exceptions and allow the Japanese to exploit them as their vanguard for invasion? Korean farmers' immigration to China is based on Article 3 of the Tumen River Boundary Treaty of the third year of Xuantong. According to the provisions of that article, they are only allowed to continue living in the cultivated areas north of the Tumen River. Thus, the scope of allowable immigration according to the treaty is limited to the old Yanji Prefecture of Jilin. This incident occurred in Changchun, which is not a location stipulated in the treaty, and Korean farmers have no right to rent land for cultivation. Over the years, the Liaoning authorities have been misled by the false name of appeasement and allowed Korean farmers to spread throughout Liaoning and Jilin provinces, and the 'Korean farmers obeying Chinese laws and regulations' layer of the Tumen River Boundary Treaty has long been regarded as worthless, merely adding hundreds of thousands of foreign farmers who do not obey Chinese laws and regulations to Liaoning and Jilin provinces, creating a fire, and those with knowledge have long worried that it would erupt. The Wanbaoshan Incident is just the result of years of neglect that should have been received. The Japanese do not plan to thoroughly resolve the matter, but we should have proactively proposed it long ago. For the present plan, we should only, according to Article 3 of the Tumen River Boundary Treaty, investigate all Korean farmers who have over-cultivated in Liaoning and Jilin provinces, and for those who have cultivated land outside the scope of Yanji, the cultivated land should be recovered by the government at a given price or transferred to local farmers at a prepared price. If the Japanese believe that this right has been acquired for many years, and China has been accommodating in the past and should be tolerant in the future, then a special treaty should be signed with the Japanese: (1) These farmers should be recognized by Japan as having fully obtained Chinese nationality and will no longer be treated with dual nationality as before; (2) Koreans who arrive after the treaty is signed should still be handled in accordance with Article 3 of the Tumen River Boundary Treaty. Another issue of the same importance as the Korean farmers' over-cultivation problem is the Japanese freely setting up police stations in the eastern provinces. The relationship of this incident, the cause of the Wanbaoshan incident, lies in this point. If it were not for the extreme tolerance of the eastern provinces authorities, the Jinan May 3rd Incident would have been re-enacted long ago. The Japanese freely set up police stations in the eastern provinces, divided into two types: one is in the railway affiliated areas, and the other is set up in various counties in the eastern provinces. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, during the Zhengjiatun Incident, according to the report of Counselor Wu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the National Assembly, among the 50+ counties in Liaoning Province, only six or seven counties did not have Japanese setting up police stations freely. This is an extremely shocking thing. Therefore, when the Zhengjiatun case was resolved, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Japanese ambassador, stating its denial and requesting a general withdrawal. At that time, the person in charge was the late Minister Wu Jun Zhiyong, and your ministry should still have a case to check. In addition to the police set up in the railway affiliated areas, which should be handled at the same time as the recovery of the administrative rights of the railway affiliated areas, the case of freely setting up police stations in various counties has long been forgotten since it was negotiated once in the fifth year of the Republic of China. Since we are now seeking a thorough resolution, it should be proposed together and strive to achieve the goal of completely abolishing the free establishment of police stations, so as to avoid future troubles. We only pray that you will quickly make arrangements to comfort the expectations of the people. It is truly convenient for the public. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yuan."</p>
<h3>Re-Visiting the Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>The Korean Association in Shanghai sent representatives Cao Jingyu and Liu Zihong to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 9:00 AM yesterday to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and request: (1) Compensation, (2) Guarantee, (3) Punishment of the murderers, (4) Protest to Japan, and (5) Compensation. It was accepted, and it was said that a strict protest has been made to the Japanese government. The petition representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>
<h3>Slogans of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>(1) The Wanbaoshan case was a pre-planned conspiracy by the Japanese; (2) The Wanbaoshan case is the harbinger of Japanese aggression in Manchuria and Mongolia; (3) The Wanbaoshan case is the excuse for the Japanese to send troops to Shandong; (4) The national crisis has arrived, compatriots, wake up quickly; (5) Compatriots, rise up and destroy these enemies; (6) Demand that the government implement revolutionary diplomacy; (7) The people of the country are united against Japan as a diplomatic backing; (8) Down with Japanese imperialism; (9) Sever economic ties with Japan; (10) Long live the Three People's Principles; (11) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Requesting Relief</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China telegraphed the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Nanjing and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, saying: "Since the Wanbaoshan Incident occurred, the Korean people under Japanese rule have actually carried out organized and planned anti-Chinese riots in places such as Pyongyang. The loss of life and property of our overseas Chinese in Korea is incalculable. The responsibility for not protecting our overseas Chinese should be borne by the Japanese government. However, the overseas Chinese are in a deep and dire situation. There are insufficient resources to maintain a livelihood if they stay, and no resources to return. The association intends to request the government, in addition to serious negotiations, to quickly send high officials with food and ships to provide relief and bring the overseas Chinese out of the fire and water. As for the Japanese-Korean people who are rampant in our territory, how can our government and people tolerate it? We should also quickly plan a fundamental solution to relieve the suffering and protect the lives of the overseas Chinese. In the telegram, we cannot express our urgent prayers, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Lin Kanghou, Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Chen Riping, Lu Guangji Peng Chuli, Yuan Yin."</p>
<h3>Remittance of Funds for Condolences</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union convened an emergency meeting yesterday and resolved to allocate 200 yuan from the union's national salvation fund and remit it to the Incheon Chinese Chamber of Commerce for the relief of overseas Chinese, to express the spirit of sharing the same hatred and anger, and to advocate for national mass organizations throughout the country. The original telegram of the association is as follows: "To the Chinese Consulate in Seoul, transferred to the Incheon and other Chinese Chambers of Commerce and all overseas Chinese: The overseas Chinese in Korea have been brutally massacred by Koreans for no reason. The news has spread, and the whole country is enraged. In addition to urging the government to make efforts to negotiate, we have specially sent 200 yuan by post as relief. This telegram is specially sent and conveys our condolences. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Han."</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Will Convene All Circles to Discuss Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Protection</h3>
<p>Regarding the Korean anti-Chinese case, the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters has prepared detailed counter-proposals and submitted them to the Municipal Executive Committee for review. It is also heard that it will soon convene people from all walks of life to discuss how to deal with the Korean anti-Chinese problem and hold a warm, lasting, and effective large-scale anti-Japanese movement.</p>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Would be transferred to Beijing for negotiation, and that all negotiation documents had been transported to Beijing. What was the truth? Wang replied that the Wanbaoshan case is currently being handled on the spot by Zhong Yu, the special commissioner of the Ministry in Jilin, who is responsible for negotiating with the Japanese side. Zhong was dispatched by the Ministry and of course handles all matters according to the Ministry's instructions. The documents are transported to Beijing for the Ministry's reference and as a basis for negotiation. The negotiation is still being handled by Special Commissioner Zhong in Jilin, with instructions from the Ministry at any time. The reporter also asked whether the Japanese government had delivered a reply to our country's protest note through Shigemitsu. He replied that it had not yet been delivered, and thought it was still on the way.</p>
<h3>Formal Japanese Reply</h3>
<p>Shigemitsu Will Carry It to Beijing Tonight</p>
<p>Will Hand It Over to Foreign Minister Wang Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The Japanese government's formal reply to our country's protest against the Korean anti-Chinese incident was issued on the afternoon of the 11th and should be delivered to Shanghai today. According to sources at the Japanese Consulate, Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu will take the night train to Beijing today (14th) and meet with Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 15th to hand over the Japanese government's formal reply and continue to discuss the Korean affairs negotiations.</p>
<h3>Inland River Steamers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Blocked by Great Floods</h3>
<p>Various Shipping Bureaus Are Trying to Dredge</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the rainy season, there has been continuous heavy rain, and the water level has risen greatly in various places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The small inland river steamers, with their paddle wheels plying back and forth, are bound to damage the embankments. The water police have prohibited them from sailing, so recently the small steamers in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places have stopped running. Inland trade and transportation have been blocked. Yesterday, for the sake of meeting the demands of merchants and people in various places, the various shipping bureaus in this port agreed on methods to maintain inland river transportation and take into account flood control. This reporter specially went to various parties to investigate and will record the current status of each route as follows:</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Wuxi Route</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Wuxi route passes through many towns. Shanghai has China Merchants, Tongyuan, Ruishengxiang, and other ships sailing, and they distribute goods to various towns every day. Recently, since the floods occurred and the ships stopped running, the inland stores have not received goods and have asked the shipping bureaus to resume service. Now, after investigation by the shipping bureaus, the flood situation on this route is that ships traveling upstream above Bacheng and ships traveling downstream below Kunshan cannot sail. In the Kunshan-Bacheng section, the water is level with the shore, and the farmland is in imminent danger. The shipping bureaus have now discussed a relief method. The Shanghai-Wuxi ships will operate as usual, only to Kunshan and Bacheng. In the Kunshan-Bacheng section, small civilian boats will be dispatched to transship goods and passengers. It is planned to start trial navigation today.</p>
<h3>Huzhou Line</h3>
<p>There are six shipping bureaus operating on the Shanghai-Huzhou route, divided into early and late shifts. Early shift ships such as Yongshun and Yongan have announced that they have stopped sailing. The location of the heavy floods on this route is in the Lishui to Huzhou section. After continuous heavy rain since the 12th, the river surface and farmland are almost indistinguishable. In recent days, farmers have been rushing to dam the area. The late-night ships on this route have agreed to continue to operate as usual, but to drive slower to avoid interfering with the embankments. If it rains again, it is feared that the night ships will also be forced to stop. Many of the goods shipped from Shanghai to Huzhou and passengers going to Huzhou have changed to traveling to Wuxi and then transferring to Taihu Lake.</p>
<h3>Hujia Line</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Pinghu route is the most stable. The smaller ships can still operate during this flood. However, although the larger ships are still sailing, when they arrive in Pinghu, they cannot pass the Li Gong Bridge due to the rising water. Therefore, they can only stop in the outer harbor, and all goods and passengers are transferred by civilian boats. Also, the inland river water on the routes through the villages passed by the Jiaxing ships is the greatest. The villagers along the way strictly prohibit ship navigation. If found, they will throw bricks and stones randomly, so they have not yet sailed.</p>
<h3>Changshu Class</h3>
<p>Shanghai Changshu class is the best in Shanghai's small wheels, with the best passenger cargo of any route wheels. This time, the inland water increased, and the route wheels first stopped, and the acres along the pond were all in the water. If the sky is clear, it can be withdrawn. Now, Shanghai Changshu wheels still have no hope of resuming the shifts. Each class loses 400 or 500 yuan per day. There are also Shensu Ban and Shanghai Hangzhou Ban wheels, which have not been significantly affected. The wheels are still running, but the cargo and passengers transferred to the inland are less than usual because many of the small folk wheels on the roads have stopped.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Negotiates with the Ministry of Industry on National Products Market Cases Yesterday</h3>
<p>Formal Reply Will Be Given After the Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Government, for the case of the seizure of the National Products Market and the case of the British patrolman shooting and wounding a Chinese policeman on Haig Road, specifically went to the Ministry of Industry in the morning, led by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and Assistant Secretary Tang, as representatives of the Municipal Government, to negotiate. The secretary of the Ministry of Industry received them. After Yu stated the purpose, the secretary of the Ministry of Industry said that the closure of the National Products Market was entirely due to the poor equipment of the market and for the sake of the safety of the tourists. Therefore, this move was made, and the tourists are all Chinese, so this move by the Ministry of Industry was actually out of good intentions and did not contain any malice. This point should be forgiven by the Municipal Government. As for the three conditions submitted, such as the compensation part, which is beyond the scope of reason, it seems that it cannot be carried out at the same time. The Ministry of Industry's method of closing the dog racing track at the request of the Chinese is also the same. It seems that there is no discrimination against the Chinese. At this point, Secretary-General Yu replied reasonably that the Ministry of Industry's intervention for the sake of the safety of the Chinese is not without considerable reason, but it is only necessary to stop the entertainment department. It should not be closed and stopped along with its business market. This is the first inappropriate measure. The Ministry of Industry closed the entertainment department due to the incomplete equipment, and should also request the court to execute it. The Ministry of Industry does not rely on the law and goes through the procedures of the court, and this is the second fundamental error. As for taking the closure of the dog racing track by the Ministry of Industry as a ratio, in fact, legally speaking, it cannot prohibit people from accusing, so it cannot be taken as a ratio. However, the Municipal Government guarantees that the compensation part will be within the scope of reason and will not be excessive. It is hoped that the Ministry of Industry can also be responsible for accepting these three articles. As a result of the negotiations, the secretary of the Ministry of Industry verbally expressed acceptance and promised to submit it to the Board of Directors for discussion before giving an administrative reply. Then they talked about the case of the British patrolman shooting and wounding a Chinese policeman on Haig Road. According to the reply of the secretary of the Ministry of Industry, the last police meeting had already discussed it once, and a concrete plan would be decided after the police meeting on Wednesday this week.</p>
<h3>French Democracy Day Today</h3>
<p>Today is French Democracy Day. French Consul-General Ganglin will receive congratulations at the French Consulate on the Bund of Gongguan Road from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM today. The diplomatic community in this port will go to celebrate at that time. The lantern parade, which was held last night as usual, was suspended due to the event. The fireworks at Gujiazhai Park were not set off either. However, the various lanterns prepared by the Chinese and Vietnamese detectives in the police stations were sent to the park for display during the day yesterday, allowing people to browse them. In the French Concession, the stores hanging Chinese and French flags, the police stations, the fire brigades, and the streetcars all raised flags to celebrate.</p>
<h3>County Executive Supervision Committee</h3>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sets Up Wusong Branch Office</h3>
<p>Appoints Zhang Yuchi as Director of the Branch</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to comply with the order to set up a Wusong Branch Office, appointed the director of the branch and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday: "Reporting on the matter, on June 23rd, we received Order No. 11552 from your bureau, stating that the Wusong Chamber of Commerce had previously been ordered to send personnel to receive it along with the company. Since the former Chamber of Commerce has been revoked, the branch office should be organized to continue to be responsible and properly cleaned up within 15 days from the date of the document. The association immediately discussed it at the 53rd Standing Committee meeting on the 10th of this month and resolved: In accordance with Article 2 of the organizational charter of the branch office, which was prepared and approved, one director should be appointed, that is, Zhang Yuchi, the standing committee member of the former Chamber of Commerce, should be appointed. Before the director takes office, Sun Mingqi, the officer of the Commerce Section, will be temporarily appointed to act as the director, so as to be legally organized and avoid delaying the establishment period. In addition to sending separate letters to notify, we are preparing a document to report the compliance and request your review and approval."</p>
<h3>Public Associations Request a Temporary Suspension of Weights and Measures Inspections</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Bird's Nest, Aromatic Herb, Fruit, Fresh Pork, Pigment &amp; Sundries, Green Bamboo Shoot, Chicken &amp; Duck, and Dried Tobacco Trade Associations, etc., yesterday each appointed representatives to meet and discuss.  Regarding the new system of weights and measures, inspections have already commenced, and old instruments must be destroyed. However, various trades still face obstacles due to the differences between the old and new systems, making it difficult to comply with the limited time for conversion.  The difficulties have already been presented to the City Chamber of Commerce, which then forwarded them to the City Social Affairs Bureau for review and a decision on extending the implementation deadline.  As a response has not yet been received, why the urgency for inspections?  Wouldn't this only create disturbance? It was immediately resolved to submit another petition to the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it forward the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau and request an extension until January 1st of next year for implementation.  Separately, a formal letter was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting a temporary suspension of inspections. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Presented to earnestly request a postponement of the inspection of new weights and measures equipment, in order to allow time for preparation.  The associations, etc., received an order to promote the new system of weights and measures, and immediately notified all member firms to comply.  However, those who have adopted the new system are still few in number.  Furthermore, the new and old instruments differ in their systems.  This year and last year, the old system was still used.  To suddenly make a change at this time, with goods entering and leaving throughout the year, and the measurement methods differing at the beginning and end, would cause great inconvenience in accounting and settlement.  This type of difficulty has already been reported to your bureau through the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting an extension of the inspection deadline. Whether this is feasible is currently awaiting your instructions and decision.  Recently, it was reported that your bureau and the Public Security Bureau jointly issued a notice, stating that inspections would begin on the 11th of this month.  However, many businesses have not yet had time to prepare, and manufacturers are struggling to keep up with the numerous orders. It is difficult to enforce a uniform adoption at the same time.  A sudden inspection would only waste effort and may even cause further disturbances.  In addition to sending another letter to the City Chamber of Commerce to report the situation again, we fear that the official documents will take days to transmit. Therefore, we are submitting this joint petition in advance, explaining the difficulties in complying with the deadline to adopt the new system of weights and measures, and sending representatives to present our request.  We earnestly beseech your bureau to consider the merchants' difficulties, and approve forwarding this to the Public Security Bureau, to temporarily suspend the execution of inspections, so that businesses can prepare for the change and avoid disputes. This would truly be for the public good, etc.</p>
<h3>Department Store Association Telegrams Beijing Requesting Reduction in Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Department Store Trade Association yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, stating:</p>
<p>"Respectfully to Your Excellency, Ministry of Finance.  Upon investigation of the Shanghai City business tax rate schedule, the department store industry is listed at three per mille. Our association believes that the tax rate is too high and the business sector cannot bear the burden. Representatives were sent to Beijing to petition and personally delivered a request for a reduction.  We were grateful that Your Ministry considered this, and on the 10th of this month, the Shanghai City Finance Bureau Business Tax Preparatory Office sent a formal letter No. 1, 2, and 3 to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, stating, 'Upon investigation, the department store tax rate has already been submitted to the Finance Bureau, which has forwarded it to the City Government to consult with the Ministry of Finance for review.  The request to merge into the Beijing-Guangdong foreign goods industry for taxation should be processed after receiving the Ministry of Finance's approval.' The letter was approved as previously stated.  It is appropriate to reply to your association for your information,' etc.  Upon investigation, the nature of the department store industry is the same as the foreign goods industry. As stated in the June 2nd newspaper, Your Ministry sent a consultation letter No. 1946 to the Hubei Provincial Government regarding the term 'fu,' which explains the business tax regulations, regarding whether department stores in major commercial ports should be considered part of the foreign goods industry and should be clearly defined.  According to the nature of department stores, they are essentially an expansion of the Beijing-Guangdong foreign goods business. Therefore, business tax should be temporarily collected according to the Beijing-Guangdong foreign goods industry,' etc.  Now, in the Shanghai draft, the tax collection for the foreign goods industry is two per mille, which is already considered high.  However, the tax on the department store industry is actually three per mille. This not only contradicts the meaning of Your Ministry's explanation but also does not align with commercial realities. Therefore, we urgently present this statement, requesting a swift correction, so that the department store business tax in Shanghai City does not exceed two per mille, which is deeply appreciated by the public. The Shanghai City Department Store Trade Association bows."</p>
<h3>Sichuan Provincial Association Executive Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Many Important Cases Resolved</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Sichuan Sojourners Association in Shanghai held its fourth regular meeting yesterday and resolved the following important cases:</p>
<p>(1) According to the report by Executive Committee member Qiu He and others, the petition to the central government to reject Sichuan public bonds has been responded to by both the government and the Yuan, stating that it must await Chairman Chiang's review. Regarding how the association should continue to oppose this, it was resolved that the association should directly send a telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting him to reject the bonds. Otherwise, a mass petition will be held.</p>
<p>(2) Liu Wenhui requested the issuance of provincial public bonds, but due to the association's opposition, it was unsuccessful. He then requested the issuance of silk industry public bonds worth five million yuan. Regarding how the association should respond to this, it was resolved that the association should first send a letter to the silk merchants from the province residing in Shanghai, to investigate whether the so-called silk industry public bonds are actually related to the silk merchants. If it is a pretext for raising funds, it should be reported to the central government for opposition.</p>
<p>(3) Standing Committee member Wu Zheng proposed that, according to reports from hometown letters, the rice prices in Chengdu and Chongqing are soaring due to collusion between the stationed troops and unscrupulous merchants who are manipulating the market. The association should warn the military leaders in Sichuan not to monopolize the people's food and prohibit unscrupulous merchants from manipulating the market. It was resolved that this should be approved.</p>
<p>(4) The Chongqing movement to recover the Japanese concession sent a letter requesting that the diplomatic authorities be urged to recover the Wangjiatuo Japanese concession. It was resolved that, upon investigation, the Chongqing Japanese concession harbors bandits and protects gambling and opium dens, and it has already expired in September of this year. A telegram should be sent to urge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately recover it. However, since the recent massacres of Chinese people by the Japanese and Koreans, the anti-Japanese movement is actually a national and collective action. The association should send a telegram to urge the central government to abolish the unequal treaties between China and Japan, revoke all illegal rights of Japan in China, and send a circular telegram to the entire country to unanimously implement an economic boycott against Japan and oppose Japanese imperialism to the end. Other cases were omitted.</p>
<h3>Records of the Jisheng Association Relief Meeting</h3>
<p>Over 30,000 Yuan Collected on the Spot for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association continued to hold a disaster relief meeting the day before yesterday.  The head of the committee, Wang Yiting, was unable to attend due to other commitments and was substituted by the deputy head, Huang Hanzhi. Deputy Head Xu Qianlin, Supervisory Committee member Wang Xiaolai, Standing Committee members Sun Yuesan, Gu Jisheng, Zhu Qichen, Zhang Xianqing, and over thirty other people attended. The meeting discussed the following:</p>
<p>(1) Committee member Huang Hanzhi, on behalf of Head of Committee Wang Yiting, and all the committee members present unanimously welcomed the disaster relief office Standing Committee members Sun Yuesan, Gu Jisheng, and Wang Yaochen.  These three committee members have been enthusiastic about public welfare and dedicated to disaster relief. The entire group of colleagues welcomed them and deeply admired them, and hoped that they would regularly attend meetings and provide guidance to facilitate progress and magnify charitable intentions. The entire body unanimously approved and supported this. Furthermore, the entire group of the association welcomed the Henan disaster relief director Feng Jun Yangshan and the Shaanxi disaster relief friend Li Jun Yunmen, etc., and consoled Li Jun Yunmen, who would be departing for Jiangxi Province the next day to investigate disaster relief work. Director Feng Yangshan and Li Jun Yunmen, etc., returned from handling disaster relief in Henan and Shaanxi, where they had actually rescued people, and their achievements were outstanding. The colleagues were extremely delighted and grateful, and the entire body offered condolences and thanks.</p>
<p>(2) Committee member Zhang Xianqing said that the Jiangxi disaster relief work was reported in detail in the agenda item on Sunday, May 31st of this year.  He now requested Li Jun Yunmen to go to Jiangxi Province to investigate everything. He also reported that the Shaanxi disaster relief funds for Chang'an, Wugong, Qianxian Liquan, Wangyang, Lan'gao, and Wu counties totaled over 100,000 yuan. This time, the disaster relief in Shaanxi was carried out during the transition period between harvests. The victims were saved in no small measure. After the disaster relief in Wugong, there was also a heavy rain, and the seeds were sown. Heaven answered the people's prayers. The disaster in Wugong can be gradually reduced.</p>
<p>(3) A certain disaster relief director said that the association had handled disaster relief in nine provinces this year. The disaster relief in Henan's Yuchi and Shaanxi's Wugong and Jingyang counties, etc., has just concluded, while others have not yet been completed. Currently, there are nine porridge kitchens being operated in Chaoyang, Rehe Province, and one near Jinxi County, a total of ten. The association and the Rehe, Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang four provinces charitable association each donated 15,000 yuan, using the 30,000 yuan to operate ten porridge kitchens. This will definitely be insufficient. We have been receiving letters and telegrams seeking assistance. The association has only been unable to respond due to lack of funds, and we are at a loss. In the future, the two associations may have to increase disaster relief funds in order to be able to complete it. Currently, there is a heavy rain season, and floods are inevitable. Industrial disaster relief may be unavoidable. Currently, there are dozens of disaster-stricken counties in Anhui, Henan, and Shaanxi, etc., that are sending letters and telegrams begging for disaster relief, and it is impossible to respond. The association's last meeting calculated a shortfall of 152,600 yuan in disaster relief funds. Currently, colleagues are making every effort to plan for offsetting this. As of June 30th, there is still a shortage of over 118,000 yuan. The association's disaster relief funds have never printed and issued donation books to solicit donations. They are all contributions voluntarily made by colleagues. We hope that all charitable comrades will often visit and provide guidance, so that the people in the severely affected areas can preserve their lives to save them from the great calamity, which is what we all pray for. The public unanimously approved and supported this. It was also said that the disaster relief efforts in Suqian, Yixing, Yancheng, and Huaiyin in Jiangsu were jointly handled by the association and the Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association. All have been completed, and the forms have been created and sent to the Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association for review. The co-operated spring relief efforts in Siyang and Huaiyin will be reported as soon as the Jiangsu Disaster Relief Director Li Xilin completes the forms.</p>
<p>(4) Committee member Zhu Qichen said that the association's original purpose was to cultivate virtue and save the world. Now that the calamity has not subsided, it is time for us to accumulate virtue and save people. Today, we welcome everyone to speak out for the victims. All of us can offer moral guidance and save the people's livelihood from the tragic calamity. The association's reputation has recently been admired by society. All of this is due to the merits and virtues of our charitable comrades. We only hope that morality will continue to flourish and that the relief of the people will be even more urgent. We will work together to bring about the ultimate praise, and we offer our heartfelt blessings and expectations. The public unanimously approved and supported this.</p>
<p>(9) Committee member Wang Xiaolai said that when the Jisheng Association was founded sixteen years ago, its scale was not very large. Because of one thought of kindness, disaster relief was the premise, and because colleagues performed their duties in disaster relief, the provinces far and near benefited from it, and there was no shortage of praise. Looking at the achievements of today's development, everyone is proceeding according to their strength. Although there are still deficits today, the moral reputation has grown, and there will definitely be more people who entrust their vows to relief. Moreover, disaster relief is like treating illness. If there is no disaster or illness, even benevolent skills and strength will have nowhere to be applied. At this time when disaster relief is needed, everyone should do what they can, and they will naturally cultivate virtue and gain blessings. The public unanimously agreed.</p>
<p>(6) Committee member Gu Jisheng said, "I am unworthy of being welcomed by you. If I can do anything to help with disaster relief, I will respectfully follow your footsteps to live up to your expectations."</p>
<p>(7) A certain disaster relief director also said, "I recently heard the words of Committee members Zhu Qichen and Wang Xiaolai, who carry on the teachings of our great benefactors above and alleviate the suffering of the people's livelihood below. We who live in peace on the sea must first sacrifice our own donations and help, and with sincere hearts, summon charitable comrades in the country. There will surely be those who will rise up when they hear the news." The public was moved by this, and each expressed their willingness to donate funds. Over 30,000 yuan was collected on the spot for disaster relief. The colleagues unanimously expressed their sincere thanks.</p>
<h3>Jinpu Railway Transportation Merchant Guarantee Money</h3>
<p>The Transfer Association Sends a Letter Requesting a One-Time Refund</p>
<p>The Shanghai Huhangning Transportation Industry Association sent an express mail telegram to the Pukou Jinpu Railway Management Committee yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"We are greatly bewildered by the news report that your railway will implement the cancellation of the merchant transportation vehicle registration method and refund the guarantee money in installments starting from July 1st. We believe that the transportation industry is entrusted by the cargo merchants to report the transportation of goods, which means that they are the representatives of the cargo merchants. The railway bureau should provide vehicles for loading in order to receive the vehicle subsidy. It is already unreasonable and unfair that the transportation merchants are required to deposit a large amount of guarantee money in order to have the right to request vehicles, and only receive an annual interest rate of four percent. Now that you dare to cancel the registration vehicle application method, you should, according to reason and fairness, refund all the guarantee money at the same time. However, your railway is actually clearing the guarantee money deposited by the transportation merchants in one go, but in three installments. This will inevitably cause the transportation merchants to suffer too much loss. This method is particularly unfair. Our association cannot remain silent and should request clarification and promptly refund the entire amount of the guarantee money in one go in order to comply with the law. We are eagerly awaiting your response. The Shanghai Huhangning Transportation Industry Association bows in respect."</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Public Bond Fundamental Solution Approved</h3>
<p>Jiangzhe Silk Reeling Machine Registration Procedures Completed</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe Silk Industry Public Bond Executive Committee held its seventh meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Commodity Inspection Bureau. The committee members Mu Qichu, Zou Bingwen, Chen Shutang, Chu Jianzeng, Shen Huachen, Qian Fenghao, and expert committee members Zhou Tingding, Zheng Bijang, etc., eight people in total, were present. Mu Qichu chaired the meeting. As a result of the discussion:</p>
<p>(1) The request to exempt silk reeling from taxes was resolved to be difficult to implement.</p>
<p>(2) The method of levying a special tax on double cocoon silk was resolved to be presented to the Ministry of Industry to order the customs to collect the tax uniformly from the date of receiving the Ministry's order. For those that have not been collected before, the Commodity Inspection Bureau will be ordered to investigate and make up the payment and transfer it to the Fund Management Committee.</p>
<p>(3) The fundamental solution was approved according to the amended plan. The amended regulations for installing machinery and blackboards are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Each manufacturer must register within the time period stipulated by the Executive Committee. After registration, they must install the equipment within the time period stipulated by the Executive Committee. After the installation is completed, the subsidy can be paid out only after the Executive Committee has inspected it.</p>
<p>(2) If a manufacturer is unwilling to report the installation within the time period, they will be allowed to report the installation within two months after the expiration date. If they still do not report the installation after the expiration date, the payment of their subsidy will be suspended.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the silk reeling machine registration procedures in Jiangzhe have been completed. The statistics are as follows: 26,066 units in Shanghai, 1,593 double cocoon units, 14,438 units in Wuxi, and 7,732 units in Zhejiang, totaling 49,829 units. The committee will submit a document to the Ministry for review in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Dr. Love's Work After Coming to China</h3>
<p>Dr. Love, the American agricultural higher adviser of the Ministry of Industry and the chief technician for crop improvement in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, came to China in April of this year. After his arrival, he went to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to inspect the work of various agricultural experimental fields. He is currently studying the current system and experimental methods of each field based on the results of the inspection to see if there are any changes and improvements that should be made so that he can contribute to the authorities. During the inspection, Dr. Love and Dr. Shen Zonghan, a technician at the Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry General Station, selected many excellent single spikes of wheat in preparation for planting this winter to conduct comparative experiments next year to gradually cultivate excellent varieties so that farmers can obtain more harvest using the same cultivation methods. In addition to the inspection, Dr. Love plans to convene technicians from various experimental fields and agricultural schools in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this winter to conduct several months of training. This month, he also contacted Jinling University to organize a crop discussion meeting and give lectures on crop statistical methods to increase the knowledge of the listeners about agricultural experimental methods. It is reported that as many as 79 agricultural affairs agencies from various provinces went to Ningbo to participate in the discussion meeting.</p>

<h3>Cao Boquan Approved to Be Released from Detention</h3>
<p>Result of Rescue by Shanghai Gentry and Merchants</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government Relays the Order to Comply</p>
<p>Cao Boquan, the magistrate of Zhenhai County, was previously impeached and suspended from his post by the Control Yuan for being implicated in a case. The Shanghai gentry and merchants residing in Shanghai, believing that the magistrate was usually honest and just, repeatedly jointly submitted petitions to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Control Yuan requesting a review. It is now known that the acting magistrate of the county, Zheng Yu, reported to the provincial government requesting instructions on whether Cao should continue to be detained after completing his handover. It is reported that the provincial government received a reply from the Civil Service Office stating that Cao was approved to be released from detention. It is also reported that the provincial government has already instructed the Zhenhai County government to take note. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Received the report. Upon investigation of whether the county magistrate should continue to be detained, a letter was previously sent to the Civil Service Office of the National Government to forward it for review and instructions. A reply has now been received approving the transfer of the instructions and approving the release from continued detention. In addition to instructing the Department of Civil Affairs to take note and forward the instructions, you should immediately take note of this order."</p>

<h3>Swindled Out of a Large Sum After Being Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Still Not Out of Danger After Being Kidnapped for Over a Year</p>
<p>Swindled Out of a Large Sum by Someone Entrusted to Help</p>
<p>Two Relatives of the Defendant Deny Fraud</p>
<p>Lin Zengrong, son of Lin Jiang of No. 69 Rue Poussin, French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits in February of last year and has not yet been rescued for more than a year. The police have now found that after the case occurred, Fang Daoquan, Jing Bodil, Jing Guangfu, etc., went to the victim's home on the pretext of helping to negotiate with the bandits in an attempt to swindle a large sum of money. Fang and others were arrested, and they were brought to the French Court yesterday for questioning. First, the Western detective explained the background of the case. Then, the plaintiff, Lin Jiang, stated that after her son was kidnapped, the woman entrusted Zhang Jiaping to negotiate with the bandits and was successively swindled out of 18,000 yuan, but her son was still not rescued. Therefore, she entrusted relatives Jing Bodil and his son Jing Guangfu and Fang Daoquan to help find a solution, but they still had no success and fabricated her son's handwritten letter and fake telegrams, etc., in an attempt to defraud her. However, my son was kidnapped and has not yet been rescued, and his whereabouts are unknown. My husband died of grief because of this. I am seeking justice. The defendants, Jing Bodil and Jing Guangfu, father and son, hired lawyers Plamée and Fessenden to defend them, claiming that Jing Bodil is the father-in-law of the kidnapped person Lin Zengrong, and Jing Guangfu is the brother-in-law of the kidnapped person. After Lin was kidnapped last year, he entrusted the defendants, father and son, to find a way to rescue him. The defendants, father and son, then entrusted Fang Daoquan to assist in the handling. The plaintiff's side entrusted a person surnamed Shen to send 7,500 yuan to the defendants, etc. Later, the money was returned in full, which shows that although the defendants helped to handle the matter, they did not commit any fraud. When the plaintiff was at the police station, the captain asked her why she wanted to sue the defendants, and the plaintiff replied that a sage (that is, a witch) told her that if she wanted her son to be rescued, she must investigate the closest relatives, so she filed a lawsuit. It can be seen that the plaintiff completely misunderstood the slander of the witch and filed the lawsuit. We are seeking a clear investigation. The officer asked Fang Daoquan, why did you want to fabricate telegrams to deceive the plaintiff? Fang replied that it was because Jing Guangfu told me that because his sister had fainted several times since his brother-in-law Lin Zengrong was kidnapped, in order to protect his sister's life, he forged the telegram from Zhenjiang asking about the delivery of goods and pretended it was a telegram from the kidnappers, falsely claiming that if 7,500 yuan could be paid, they would release him, etc., to reassure her. There was no act of fraud. The witness Lin Jing said that after her husband was kidnapped, she first entrusted Zhang Jiaping to negotiate with the bandits and was swindled out of 18,000 yuan, but there were still no results. Therefore, the woman asked her father and brother to help with the handling, which is true. The Chinese and Western officials adjourned to wait for the verdict.</p>
<h3>A Fisherman's Drifting Record</h3>
<p>Xu Zhitang Makes a Living by Catching Cuttlefish</p>
<p>A Small Boat Meets a Hurricane at the Foot of the Mountain</p>
<p>Experiences Two Days and Nights of Terrifying Waves</p>
<p>Fortunately, Met a Japanese Ship and Was Rescued Alive</p>
<p>Around 4:00 PM on the day before yesterday (the 12th), the Japanese trading company Mitsui &amp; Co.'s ship Munakata Maru, was sailing from Japan to Ma'anshan outside Wusongkou. While passing through the waters of Daji Mountain, the ship's owner, Japanese J. Kawazoe, was in the pilothouse, using binoculars to observe the route. He unintentionally saw something like a small boat in the distance, floating with the waves, and saw someone lying down in the small boat. Therefore, he was very surprised and ordered the ship to follow the small boat. When they got close, they saw someone in the small boat. They then ordered the sailors to lower the lifeboat and sail to check. They saw the person in the small boat lying motionless and barely breathing. They devised a method to drag the person and the small boat onto the ship. The ship's doctor performed emergency surgery, and the person gradually woke up. The ship owner and others asked him why he was drifting in the ocean. He said his name was Xu Zhitang, from Jiangshan, Ningbo. He was thirty-four years old and made a living by catching cuttlefish. He lived in Wangjiajingting Township, Jiangshan, and had a wife and two sons at home. On the morning of the 11th, he was catching cuttlefish alone in a small boat near Qushan. When he returned to the foot of Xianaoshan, a hurricane suddenly blew up, and the small boat could not control itself and drifted with the wind. Xu hurriedly used all his strength to row the boat to the shore, but unexpectedly, the waves were like mountains and seas and pushed the small boat out to sea, further away from the shore. Xu had exhausted his strength and had no way to escape. Knowing that there was no hope of survival, he used a rope to tie himself and the boat tightly together and had to let it drift with the waves. After drifting in the ocean for a day and night, he was soaked by strong winds and heavy rain. Xu was hungry and cold and soon lost consciousness. The small boat drifted in the ocean for another day until it was rescued by a Japanese ship before he woke up, etc. The ship's owner and others took pity on his situation and provided food and courteous treatment. When the ship returned to Shanghai from Ma'anshan and sailed into Wusongkou at around 7:00 AM yesterday, Chen Shoujing, the inspector of the Wusong branch office of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Foreigner Passport Inspection Office, boarded the ship for inspection. The Japanese ship owner told him the story. Inspector Chen Shoujing then took Xu Zhitang and the small boat to Wusong and sent them to the Songsi Fourth Detachment of the Water Patrol Team. After Captain Xiao Ping questioned him, Xu recounted the story, and Captain Ding sent a quick letter to his family on his behalf and sent the police to escort Xu to the Water Patrol Headquarters in Nanshi for disposition.</p>
<h3>Seizure of Private Handguns and Bullets</h3>
<p>Previously Convicted and Fined</p>
<p>Commits a Crime Again After Being Released</p>
<p>At around 8:00 PM the night before last, Huatanmu Liu Decheng and Indian patrol officer No. 87 of the Hongkou patrol station were checking pedestrians around Broadway Road and Nanxun Road when they saw Liu Fengyou from Shandong riding a rickshaw from east to west with a panicked expression. They immediately stopped him and found three handguns, 225 bullets, and six magazines, loaded in boxes, on his person. They were taken to the patrol station. The patrol captain ordered him to be detained. Yesterday, he was taken to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The patrol station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, stood up and explained the background of the case, requesting a postponement. Huatanmu Liu and Indian patrol officer No. 87 reported the situation when the defendant was arrested at the time and presented the guns and bullets for inspection. When questioned, Liu Fengyou confessed that he was a worker at the Hongkou China Merchants Wharf. A friend surnamed Hu, who was going abroad, paid him six yuan to take them to Xinbeimen. He did not know that there were firearms hidden in the box. He asked for forgiveness. The patrol station's lawyer, Li, stood up and said that the defendant was previously convicted of theft and sentenced to six months in prison. He was released on the 15th of last month, but he committed a crime again, etc. Judge Xiao Xieying ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for verification.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over a Concubine Contract</h3>
<p>Zhang Deqing Sued by Concubine for Breach of Contract</p>
<p>Defendant's Lawyer Claims No Written Agreement Exists</p>
<p>Zhang Deqing, a shareholder and manager of the Guizhou Road China Hotel and a native of Huzhou who also owns the New World Hotel in Wuxi, is currently forty-six years old. In June of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he took a woman named Zhang Wanshi as his concubine in Wuxi. The woman was from Wuxi and was thirty-two years old. At the time, both parties signed a contract containing four conditions: (1) Zhang would provide the woman with a monthly living allowance of sixty yuan; (2) Zhang would allocate a portion of his property to Wanshi as a means of support in her old age; (3) Zhang would not take any further concubines; and (4) If he were to break the agreement, he would be subject to legal sanctions. However, since they began living together, Zhang has not fulfilled the agreement. Recently, he even took a woman named Mei Mei as a concubine and spent thousands of taels of silver on clothing and jewelry for her. Upon hearing this news, Wanshi immediately traveled to Shanghai to confront Zhang at the China Hotel. However, Zhang refused to meet with her. Therefore, she hired lawyer Zhang Ding to file a lawsuit with the Special District Court, demanding payment of 4,320 yuan for living expenses and 1,500 yuan for a portion of his property. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Yi of the Tenth Civil Court summoned the defendant Zhang Deqing, who did not appear. Instead, lawyer Ye Shaoying appeared on his behalf. First, lawyer Zhang, representing the plaintiff, stated the grounds for the lawsuit and presented the contract as evidence. However, lawyer Ye claimed that the plaintiff was originally the wife of Xu Hanruo and that she and the defendant were in a relationship of concubinage. Less than three months after the defendant and the plaintiff began their relationship, the plaintiff's husband found out and accused the defendant of adultery and fleeing. This was reported in the Wuxi newspapers at the time. Later, an out-of-court settlement was reached, and the plaintiff and the defendant separated. However, no written agreement was made. Now, the plaintiff has suddenly filed a lawsuit with this court, which is quite extraordinary. He then presented the Wuxi newspapers as evidence. Judge Yang stated that the case needed to be investigated by the Wuxi County Government and ordered both parties to withdraw and await a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Dredging of the South Shanghai Wharf</h3>
<p>Commences Today</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai South Steamboat Wharf was taken over by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, it has been recognized that the wharf's shore is silted up and shallow, making it difficult for steamboats to dock, which has greatly affected the market in South Shanghai. It was reported to Mayor Zhang, who consulted with Director Song of the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau. It was decided that the Bureau would undertake the dredging project, which will begin today at Wharf No. 1, Dongmen Road, 16 Pu, and continue to Dongjiadu. The entire project is expected to take about four months to complete. During the construction, an area of 1,000 feet in front and behind the dredger must be kept clear. The Bureau of Public Works has sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, instructing the water patrol to temporarily prohibit all ships from navigating or docking within this area to avoid obstructing the construction. It is also understood that the Bureau of Public Works plans to take advantage of the opportunity to dismantle and repair the floating docks, as the dredging of one wharf shore will render four docks unusable at the same time. It is reported that the Bureau of Public Works has requested the Bureau of Engineering to promptly invite merchants to estimate the cost of the repairs so that they can be carried out simultaneously.</p>

<p>Qiu Changgao Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhou Xisan and Others Vigorously Pursued and Brought to Justice</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that Wang Baoxiang, a native of Funing, Jiangsu, has lived in Shanghai for over forty years and founded many charitable organizations. He was particularly active in revolutionary work, providing assistance to revolutionary party members in Shanghai who were in difficulty. He sacrificed his family's wealth and resources, and everyone considered him to have a chivalrous spirit. During the Northern Expedition of the Party Army in the sixteenth year of the Republic, Wang personally led revolutionary comrades in response. After the military was settled, Commander Gu Zhutong appointed him as a senior advisor to reward his revolutionary contributions. In the winter of that year, he returned to his hometown on business. When the ship reached the Yushan River, he was unexpectedly murdered by Zhu Shoutong and Zhou Xisan, who had been his followers for many years and were related to him, in collusion with Zhou Xinsheng, Qiu Changgao, Wang Xinliang, Wang Er, Qiu Changlin, and others. He was shot three times and died immediately. His body was abandoned in the river by Qiu Changgao. Later, his family discovered it and reported it to the Funing County Government, which arrested Zhu Shoutong and others. After being informed that the case involved military affairs and should be punished according to military law, they were presented to the Military and Political Department of Tian, which designated the Songhu Garrison Command to hear the case.

<h3>A Lifetime of Love, One Death, One Survival</h3>
<p>Man Ma Shouxiang is Dead</p>
<p>Woman Ma Alan is Well</p>
<p>At 1:20 PM on the 12th, the Huis police station at the North Railway Station, No. 5 Jielu Road, reported that a male and female guest in Room 11 of the North Railway Station Hotel had attempted suicide by taking poison due to passionate love. The man was speechless, and the woman was still alive. The police officer inquired about the date of arrival, names, and occupations of the male and female guests. It was reported that the guests arrived at the hotel at 4:00 PM on the 11th. The male guest claimed to be Dong Chenxue, 22 years old, a silk merchant from Wuxi. The woman's name was Ma Alan, also 22 years old, from Wuxi. The male and female guests were seen entering and leaving together, very intimate, and whispering sweet nothings. There was no sign of suicide. Today, when the waiter saw that the guests had not opened the door, he had to inquire whether the room needed to be renewed according to the rules. However, after knocking on the door for a long time, there was no response. Knowing that something was wrong, he managed to pry open the door and found an empty opium paste box on the table, indicating that they had taken poison. The police officer dispatched detectives to the hotel to investigate and found a suicide note on the pillow, which stated, "We two will end our lives here, but we do not want anyone to know after death. We only wish to be buried together." The man and woman were immediately taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment. However, the man had taken too much poison and died shortly after arriving at the hospital. His body was taken to the forensic examination center on Fielun Road for examination. Yesterday, the female guest, Ma Alan, recovered and was sent back to the police station. After further questioning by the police officer, she stated that the deceased's real name was Ma Shouxiang, a painter in Wuxi, with a wife and a three-year-old daughter. He had fallen in love with her a long time ago. Later, she married someone else, but her husband died not long after. Ma Shouxiang then asked her to rekindle their love, but she refused, as several people were flirting with her at the time. Ma Shouxiang eventually became ill from unrequited love. She pitied his sincerity and agreed to his request. Ma recovered from his illness. Today's double suicide was due to economic pressure and family disapproval. They did not want to live alone, so they asked to be buried together. It is reported that the case will be taken to court for trial today.</p>
<h3>Girl, 7 or 8 Years Old, Tragically Injured and Killed</h3>
<p>Zhang Wawa's Leg Broken, Dying</p>
<p>Qin Jindi Severely Injured</p>
<p>Qin Hanzhang and Zhang Heshang, both locals, live together in Lane 379, Datiebang, in the French Concession. Qin works as a shop assistant at the British Consulate, and Zhang is a construction worker. Each family has a daughter. Qin's daughter is named Jindi, 7 years old, and Zhang's daughter is named Wawa, 8 years old. Yesterday was the French Democratic Memorial Day, which usually involves a lantern parade. Every year on the night of July 13th, various unique lanterns are gathered and paraded in the concession. Although this year the French authorities issued an order to postpone the event due to the unrest, most of the people had not heard the news and still gathered with their families along Avenue Joffre and Boulevard de Montigny. Qin Jindi and Zhang Wawa heard people talking and secretly invited each other without telling their parents. They walked east along Songshan Road to Avenue Joffre, intending to watch the lanterns at the fire station. However, just as they reached the entrance of Bingyin Room at No. 192, a special truck No. 6835, carrying five or six thousand catties of huge stone bars, suddenly drove straight from west to east. The two children were about to cross the road from south to north when they were hit. Zhang Wawa was directly hit, her right leg was broken on the spot, and her abdominal organs flowed out. She died immediately. Qin Jindi's leg was also severely injured and she fell to the ground unconscious. After the accident, the police officer on duty saw it, copied down the license plate number, and took the two children to the hospital. Qin Jindi was hospitalized, and Zhang Wawa's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for forensic examination, awaiting examination today. At the same time, the family members heard the news, rushed to the scene, and wept bitterly over the body.</p>

Unexpectedly, the water-soaked brother became heavier, and the ten-year-old child did not have enough strength. Not only was he unable to save his brother, but he was also dragged down by him and fell into the river together, both drowning. When their father found out, he rushed to the scene and pulled the two children out of the water, but they were already dead. Yang was extremely saddened by the loss of two sons, and the neighbors also expressed their condolences.</p>

Zhang Shishi, a 49-year-old woman from Chongming, was robbed last month. Her house was burned down, leaving her with no place to live. She took her son, Lin Xiang, 21 years old, to Shanghai to find her younger brother, a worker on a certain sea freighter, to rely on for support. However, the ship had already departed. Unable to find her brother, they became beggars, sleeping in the open and going hungry. As a result, Zhang Shishi contracted a sudden illness and died yesterday at the 16 Pu in the South City. The police investigated and ordered a guarantor to report the case to the local court for investigation.</p>

<p>Ren Kebin Almost Lost His Life</p>
<p>Ren Kebin, who works at a pawnshop at No. 103 Guling Road, lives at No. 4 Shuxing Lane, Jiumu Land, in the city. His wife, Ren Chenshi, 20 years old, is having an affair with shoemaker Zhu Baosan. Because Ren is not often home, it creates opportunities for the illicit lovers. One night, Ren returned home and saw Zhu in his room. Zhu fled as soon as he saw Ren return. Ren did not dare to chase him. Unexpectedly, Zhu turned around and threatened him with a knife, so Ren fled and stayed at the pawnshop. When he returned home the day before yesterday, he saw Zhu sitting on the bed in his room again. Ren scolded him angrily. Unexpectedly, Zhu grabbed Ren and shouted loudly. Four people were lying in wait at the entrance of the alley, each holding an iron weapon, and were eager to kill Ren. Ren shouted for help. Some people relaxing in the alley heard him and blew a police whistle. Seeing the situation was not good, the four fled. Zhu was arrested and taken to the First Branch of the Second District along with Ren's wife.

As a result, their relationship is very poor. Yesterday afternoon, Xu returned to his residence after work. His wife scolded him for not returning for many days. An argument ensued, and she slapped him twice. Afterwards, Xu became depressed and swallowed raw opium in an attempt to die. He was taken to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and was transferred to Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await examination.</p>
<h3>Two Thousand Yuan Savings Passbook Suddenly Becomes a Fake</h3>
<p>Passbook Hidden in Chest</p>
<p>Wife Took it Out to Mortgage</p>
<p>Afraid of Husband's Discovery</p>
<p>Created a Fake Passbook to Conceal</p>
<p>Tang Guitao, 59 years old, from Songjiang, has been running a Jiangcao shop at No. 51 Wangjiazuijiao, Xiaonanmenwai, in the South City. His business is thriving. Tang had deposited two thousand yuan in foreign currency at the Detai Xing Doumai Bank. The passbook was hidden in a chest. The other day, due to an urgent need, he opened the chest and took the passbook to the bank to withdraw the funds. However, the bank carefully examined it and recognized that the passbook was not issued by the bank, and the seal on the passbook was also a counterfeit. Tang was greatly shocked upon hearing this and immediately rushed home. Because the chest was managed by his wife, he repeatedly questioned his wife about the whereabouts of the passbook and the origin of the fake passbook. Tang's wife was forced to confess that last year a neighbor, Chen Ren, borrowed silver from her due to an urgent need. Because she lacked cash, she gave the passbook from the chest to Chen Ren to mortgage it somewhere. She was afraid that you would find out about this matter and blame her, so she asked Chen Ren to forge a passbook and put it back in the chest. Tang was extremely angry upon hearing this and immediately went to Chen Ren's house and summoned Zhang Chunren, the guard at the Ninth Post, to bring her back to the First Branch of the First District. During the preliminary interrogation, the head of the station, Tang, recounted the previous events and requested a thorough investigation. Chen Ren confessed that she was 38 years old, a native of Nanjing, and had been running the Chen Hongxing Pen Shop at No. 53 Wangjiazuijiao. On February 12th of last year, she borrowed 1,200 yuan from Tang's wife due to an urgent need. Later, she borrowed another 700 yuan, for a total of 1,900 yuan, and it was agreed that the monthly interest rate would be 3%, so she had to pay 57 yuan in interest every month, which she had never interrupted. Recently, business in the store has been poor, so she has been two months in arrears. As for the fake passbook, she did not forge it. However, she had seen Tang's wife give a blank passbook to her shop assistant Zhou Dingxiang to fill out. But she did not know what he wrote. The police then summoned Zhou to the case for questioning. He confessed that he was 32 years old, a native of Chongming. In February of last year, Tang's wife brought a blank passbook and asked him to fill in the words "Deposit 2,000 yuan in foreign currency" on the passbook. He did not agree at first, but Tang's wife claimed that it did not matter. He could not refuse her request, so he wrote it on her behalf. However, he did not know about the fake seal on the passbook. Considering the complexity of the case and its importance, they were ordered to be detained separately pending investigation.</p>
<h3>The Li Guojun's Daughter, Li Jiazhen, Lawsuit Concludes</h3>
<p>Judgment Scheduled for the 18th</p>
<p>Li Jiazhen, the daughter of Li Guojun, was betrothed to Zhang Jinjiang from a young age. At that time, she was young and ignorant and did not object. As she grew older, she realized that the Zhang family was gradually declining and feared that she would face difficulties in the future. She expressed her opposition to her father, who agreed to provide her with a dowry of 22,000 yuan, with 8,000 yuan for wedding attire and 12,000 yuan deposited in a bank to generate interest for her daily living expenses. However, in 1929, her father passed away. On his deathbed, he made an oral will stating that 100 yuan should be given to Jiazhen each month for her daily use with her husband. Later, Jiazhen and her husband had a falling out and she left him, filing a lawsuit with the Special District Court demanding that her stepmother hand over the 12,000 yuan. This case has been reported in this newspaper several times, and the court has also held several hearings. Yesterday was the last hearing. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appeared. The plaintiff's attorney stated that the case was originally intended to be settled out of court, but the defendant showed no sincerity, which led to the breakdown of the settlement. The plaintiff is currently in the hospital due to illness and is in great need of funds for all expenses. Moreover, Guojun and his brother Mugong jointly own 3 million taels of family property, which has not been divided. This small amount is easy to raise. As for the 3 million in inheritance, a lawsuit has also been filed based on the law that women have inheritance rights. As for the defendant's claim that there is a will that can prove it, her father was already in a coma when he was dying and only made an oral will, without a written will. This was something the plaintiff witnessed personally at the time. Now, a written will has suddenly been discovered, which the plaintiff completely denies. The defendant's lawyer then presented the will to the court and claimed that when Li Guojun was in critical condition, he asked this lawyer to go and verify it. Because he had to go to Hangzhou, he entrusted assistant lawyer Xu Enjing to act on his behalf and affix a seal. Therefore, the plaintiff's claim that there is no such will is untrue. As for the 3 million in family property, there has not yet been a detailed accounting. It is still difficult to determine whether there is a surplus or a deficit. Moreover, most of the real estate is located in the original home in Hefei. Currently, bandits are rampant everywhere, and even if the amount is as claimed by the plaintiff, it would not be convenient to go there to sell it. Therefore, only 100 yuan can be given each month to meet Jiazhen's daily needs. He requested that the court reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. The court ordered the debate to begin. After the plaintiff's and defendant's lawyers finished their arguments, the court scheduled a judgment for the 18th.</p>
<h3>Six Bandits Each Imprisoned for Five Years in Western Prison</h3>

Jin Jiulin, special investigator of the French Police Department, detective Li Yaolong, deputy detective Qian Yumin, Mao Jinggen, Zhang Ziying, etc., investigated and apprehended Shi and the six bandits together, confiscated a pistol from Yang A Si, and recovered the stolen goods. Wang Chen Shi was also brought into the police station by the woman. Yesterday, they were taken to the French Public Concession for interrogation. First, the head of the Western Investigation team reported the previous events. The defendants confessed to the robbery. Wang Chen Shi said that the woman had been in a relationship with Zhu Ruilin for a short time and did not know about the theft. She asked for mercy. Chinese and Western officials sentenced Yang A Si and Cai Jinsheng to five years in the Western prison, and then they were deported and sent to the mainland for trial. Shi Jin Dao, Hu Ruisheng, Zhu Ruilin, and Lin A Er were each imprisoned for five years, and after their release, they were permanently deported from the Concession. The pistol was confiscated, and Wang Chen Shi was deported.</p>

<p>Three Bandits Taken to the Bureau for Interrogation</p>
<p>The Yu Tai Oil and Rice Store at No. 1, Lane 22, Xiaoyangjia House, Pudong, was robbed by several bandits on the evening of the 6th of this month, with a loss of about 400 yuan. The owner, Shen Shaoyun, reported the case to the Fourth Police Team, which in turn reported it to the Third District and submitted it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. The other day, Third District detectives Zhang Yong and Yang Jinsen apprehended the bandit Gu Futang (aka Tao Tao). Under strict interrogation, Gu confessed that he was 26 years old, a native of Pudong, living near No. 30,000 Changjia House, doing small business. He admitted to having robbed the Yu Tai Oil and Rice Store with accomplices Xu Zhangquan, Xi Aqiu, Xiao Chongming, etc. The stolen goods were divided in Room 19 of the Suzhou Hotel, and he received 15 yuan in silver and 13,000 copper coins. He was ordered to be detained. At the same time, detectives were sent to apprehend the escaped bandits. Unexpectedly, Gu, fearing punishment, suddenly attempted to hang himself with his belt in the detention center. Police Captain Zhang discovered this and cut the belt down. Fortunately, it was not long before he lost consciousness. He was taken out of the detention center, given a small amount of Sha Yao water for his stomach cramps, and placed under strict guard. Xu Zhangquan and Xi Aqiu were soon apprehended by the original detectives. Xu claimed to be 20 years old, a local, living at No. 8 Tongxing Street, working at the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory. Xi claimed to be 20 years old, a native of Nanhui, living on Banbian Street, Sanwanchang, running a tofu shop. Both denied being bandits and claimed that Gu Futang had framed them out of hatred. They requested an investigation. The district head, considering the case involved robbery, did not dare to decide on his own and ordered Gu, Xu, and Xi, along with the informant Shen Xiaodi, to be taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Various Circles Opposing the Atrocities of American Sailors</h3>
<p>(Omitted titles) For your information, since the past two months, the American police stationed in Shanghai, relying on the Concession and consular jurisdiction as protection, have arbitrarily infringed on the lives of our compatriots. For example, the shooting of Gu Jingen on April 22, the drowning of Dai Tingzuo on May 23, the stabbing of Ma Chengbu and Qu Shixiang on May 26, and the stabbing of Yang Jiner, Wang Jinfa, Ma Lin, and Sun Deshi on May 28. These four cases are all great hidden dangers for the future of our nation. If we do not rise up together and actively work towards the realization of recovering the Concessions and legal rights and abolishing all unequal treaties, not only will the dead be gone, but the living will also be unable to survive. Speaking of this, can one not be chilled to the bone? However, since the four cases occurred one after another, the culprits have been at large, and the other party has turned a blind eye. Where is humanity? Where is justice? All circles in Shanghai, suffering from a deep sense of pain, have taken the lead in expressing their grievances and are determined to organize themselves as pioneers of the nation and a backing for the government. In addition to sending letters to the American authorities in the name of all Shanghai organizations, drawing attention to two points regarding the incident: (1) To automatically provide a legal and satisfactory solution to the above four cases. (2) To automatically withdraw the stationed troops and renounce special rights in China to enhance amity between China and the United States, we hereby send this telegram, hoping that the people of the country will unanimously advocate and provide strong support to achieve our goals, eliminate national shame, and ensure the safety of our people. The telegram is urgent and we eagerly await your response. Shanghai Various Circles Anti-American Sailor Atrocities Committee, etc.</p>

<p>Thieves Highly Skilled</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the goods displayed in the showroom of the Jingguang Optical Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road were stolen clean by thieves after midnight on Saturday. According to its managing director, Lei Guxun, the total value is estimated to be several thousand taels of silver.

Moreover, patrol officers are stationed near the company day and night. However, neither before nor after the incident were any suspicious people seen loitering nearby. Even the patrolling officers who passed by the company's windows that night did not see anything unusual inside. The first person to discover the theft was Lei Guxun. According to his report to the police station, he was walking along Nanjing Road at around 3:00 a.m. when he stopped and looked back at the company. He saw that the lights in the showroom were bright and the items were in disarray. The display cabinets had been pried open, and the valuables had been taken clean.

<h3>Incoming Letters</h3>
<p>Sir, On the 13th of this month, in the local news section of your newspaper, you published a message that the Municipal Public Security Bureau intends to inspect the bodies of foreigners coming to China. After investigation, our bureau has not yet made such a proposal, nor has it received any orders regarding this matter. I urgently request that you make a correction to conform to the facts. Sincerely, Chief Editor, Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Secretariat, July 13th.</p>
<p>Sir, I have read the news in your newspaper on July 12th about the suspension of Shanghai-Manchuria airmail and the delivery by train. The facts are not true and may be a misrepresentation of rumors. After investigation, the Shanghai-Manchuria air route of our company was affected by adverse weather conditions a few days ago, and Flight No. 2 landed in Outer Mongolia, causing a misunderstanding. Furthermore, the continuous plum rains in the north and south caused trains and ships in various places to stop. Our company also temporarily suspended two flights. Later, in view of the importance of postal transportation, which cannot be stagnated, it was decided that the flight schedule would be temporarily changed to one round trip each week to the north and south starting from the 12th of this month, that is, from Shanghai to Manchuria every Sunday, and from Manchuria to Shanghai every Tuesday (all departure and arrival times are in accordance with the original schedule and will not be changed), and airmail will be transported as usual to avoid suspension of postal services. Once the misunderstanding of the Outer Mongolia incident is explained, the weather improves, and there are no more obstacles, the flight will still be operated according to the original schedule. The company has notified the newspapers on the 12th and published an important notice declaring the change of schedule, and there is no suspension of flights or delivery of mail by train. In order to prevent people from not knowing the truth, I hereby request that you check and make corrections, which will be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Shenbao, Eurasia Airlines, July 13th.</p>

<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>School on the Train</p>
<p>The government of Canada pays extraordinary attention to children's education. They believe that if children cannot go to school, then the school should accommodate them and move the teaching to them. With this principle in mind, they resolutely implemented it. In several places in Ontario Province, most of the people make a living by logging. They travel with their families to log, and it is impossible for them to live in one place for a long time. Therefore, their children cannot be enrolled in ordinary schools. The education authorities came up with a novel idea to use trains as schools. The trains were equipped with desks and seats, like classrooms, and traveled back and forth on the 600-mile-long railway, gathering children along the way to study. Although the area is vast and the time is limited, each child cannot go to school every day, but they still receive some considerable education.</p>
<p>The Cleanest City in the World</p>
<p>In any country or metropolis in the world, it is inevitable to see untidy streets and public places. Although the municipal authorities are very strict about garbage disposal, there are still many people who like to discard discarded tram tickets, bus tickets, cigarette butts, and empty cigarette cases. Even the authorities in London have repeatedly considered banning it, but ultimately nothing can be done. But there is one place in the world that can actually do this, and that is Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. First, the local authorities announced to the whole city that anyone who pollutes the streets from a certain day in a certain month by discarding a tram ticket on the street will be arrested and fined without exception. From then on, the citizens unconsciously became clean, and Sydney became the cleanest city in the world.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Tomb of Hongfu in Liling, Hunan</h3>
<p>— Heavenly Hatred</p>
<p>I enjoy listening to people talk about historical sites. Whenever someone treats me to stories of famous historical sites, I cannot help but lean forward and forget my fatigue. Whenever I meet good friends in different places, I always bother them to talk about the historical sites of their hometowns for my own pleasure. Over a lifetime, I have heard countless stories. Unfortunately, I am a hard-working person with no ability to travel extensively, so I have heard a hundred times but seen nothing, only indulging in dreams. Recently, I met a friend from Hunan who told me that few people know where Hongfu, the beauty of the Sui Dynasty, is buried. Now I will tell you that her tomb is located at the foot of Xishan, across the river in Liling County, Hunan. Even the people of Hunan did not know about it seven or eight years ago. It was lost in the weeds. Fortunately, the broken stele was still there, not completely erased. When Zhao Hengti was in charge of Hunan, Ye Qi's brigade, part of Liu Xing's Second Division, was stationed there. A staff officer named He in the brigade headquarters was an elegant scholar. One day, he wandered to Xishan and saw a broken stele lying on the ground. He rubbed the inscriptions and recognized it as the place where Hongfu was buried. So he joined with local gentry to donate money for repairs. Once completed, a tall stele was erected in front of the tomb, inscribed with "The Tomb of Hongfu." A pavilion was built next to the tomb. Mr. He wrote a couplet himself: "Hongfu would know me if she knew; How fortunate this green mountain is to bury fragrance." He also widened the steep and sloping road in front of the tomb and planted peach and willow trees on both sides for decoration. Since then, it has become a place for travelers to visit. Hongfu's name has suddenly become well-known among the people of Liling, no less than Zhenniang of Wu and Kuai and Su Xiaoxiao of Qiantang. Although the green mountain is fortunate, it is also fortunate for Hongfu. If she knows in the underworld, she should be grateful to staff officer He. According to my research, Hongfu was originally a courtesan of Yang Su, the prime minister of the Sui Dynasty. Her surname was Zhang and her name was Chuchen. When Li Jing visited Su in plain clothes, the concubines were lined up. Among them, there was a woman holding a red whisk. She had a special beauty and stared at Jing alone. That night, Jing returned to his inn, and Hongfu ran to him, saying, "I am Hongfu, a courtesan of the Yang family. I am willing to entrust myself to a tall tree." Then she went with him to Taiyuan. As for why her tomb is in Liling, my friend said that it is said among the people of Hunan that Hongfu followed Li Jing on an expedition and died of illness while stationed in Liling. So she was buried at the foot of Xishan. The truth is impossible to verify. However, Zhenniang and Su Xiao are also impossible to verify. Even the tomb of the Fragrant Concubine of the Qing Dynasty, which is less than two hundred years old, has been disputed and it is impossible to determine which is true and which is false. Moreover, why should we insist on such a rigid view of Hongfu?</p>
<h3>Responding to Mr. Hu Zhentang's "Three Hundred Chu Saws Without Emulating the Original Rhyme" in One Verse</h3>
<p>— Yuan Xiluo</p>
<p>Human art is often not as good as heavenly masters. A clever hand writes an article as casually as poetry. When the butterfly dream awakens, Zhou is also an illusion. When the grub swallows, Zhong is also foolish. The wind and clouds tattoo the eyes for three thousand eons. The stars embroider the chest for twelve hours. When the book city is eaten by bookworms, only one sentence remains. Boldly claim that the bamboo slips are in the heart.</p>
<h3>Four Poems Presented to Mr. Yu Qiaqing on the 50th Anniversary of His Stay in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>I also schemed to go south for five years, turning the numbers upside down as if they were from heaven. It can be known that those who achieve fame in the world are destined to have longevity.</p>
<p>The robbery of the White Gate was a miracle for a hundred years. The Yellow Peril just startled the sleeping lion. It is just around the corner to create a new Shanghai. Fight with you to the end of your life.</p>
<p>Neither an official nor a hermit, also not a merchant. Neither rich nor poor, nor a crowned king. I would like to create a glorious model with my countrymen. I give you a first-class certificate of freedom. (Giving freedom is considered a grand event in Europe. Prime Minister Yingmai received this honor last summer.)</p>
<p>The Three Northern Regions are managed as an autonomous region. The hard work of many years has been a good plan. At the Golden Embankment, I listen to the wind and waves at night. My humble official's footprints are recorded in the sea corner.</p>
<h3>A Small Record of the New Green Lotus Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Wang Yanjin</p>
<p>The three characters "Green Lotus Pavilion" are known to almost every woman and child in Shanghai. Since moving to the opposite side of the Immortal World, it has been renovated and its appearance has been completely renewed. The elegance of today is far from comparable to the humility of the past. Yesterday was the anniversary of its completion, and manager Sun Shaorui invited the press to declare the reform of the nature of Biaolian Pavilion, so that poets and writers would know where to go.</p>
<p>The Past and Present in the Mouth of the Owner Mr. Sun briefly said that when the Green Lotus Pavilion was first established on Fourth Road, it was a place for the lower classes to play. Countless young workers fell into depravity here. I am really to blame. So I planned a reform plan, but I was trapped by the environment and it was difficult to realize it for a while. Now that this new house is completed, it is moved here. The business nature is different from before, and the equipment is also different. The second floor is a general bookstore and a place for various industries to sell and negotiate. The third floor has a special elegant seat, which is specially for poets and writers to discuss papers.</p>
<p>The Disappointment of the Daily Reporter Two reporters from Shanghai Daily News, Tiichiro and Sugato Harutei, were also present on time that evening. The two reporters thought that they would be able to eat Chinese food here today. Unexpectedly, Mr. Sun specially set up a Japanese restaurant on the third floor, and today he specially entertained guests with Japanese food. The two reporters were very disappointed. However, people in our country's press were very happy to taste foreign flavors.</p>
<p>The Establishment of Japanese Cuisine Japanese cuisine also has its own delicious flavors. Today, more and more people in our country are fond of Eastern flavors. However, they all have to go to Japanese restaurants in Hongkou, which are very expensive. People in our country suffer from this. Mr. Sun was aware of this, so he specially opened this department. This is the first time in Shanghai. The price is very low. So to recover the rights and interests, and to entertain Japanese news reporters, and to promote vigorously, so that even wooden clogs will gather here, then his intention is even deeper.</p>
<p>A Very Pitiful Reception There are female receptionists in the special elegant seats on the third floor. Among them, there are those who can speak Japanese. Mr. Sun asked me to test her level. After inquiring in detail, I learned that she was only twenty-eight years old. Her father used to do business in Yokohama, Japan, and was the chairman of the Chinese Zhicheng Association. He was quite famous for a time. Unfortunately, he died in the middle of the road. She drifted back to China and ended up as a female receptionist. When her father was alive, there were many guests and servants under his command. Therefore, her Japanese language is all used to address subordinates, not honorifics. However, in this career, it is necessary to use the most honorific language. Alas, the world is unreliable. Today's beggars may have been those whose carriages were filled with visitors in the past. I cannot help but speak out of emotion, so I also record it.</p>
<h3>Trivial Talk on Silk Stockings</h3>
<p>— Bing Lan</p>
<p>Clothing, food, and shelter are indispensable to life. Stockings, as daily necessities, also occupy an important position. In ancient times in our country, they were made of native cloth and called dubu stockings. Occasionally, they were made of Dutch standard cloth and called foreign cloth stockings. Later, Hong Kong thread stockings were imported and called foreign thread stockings. The size of these stockings was suitable for the feet, so everyone liked to use them. They were popular everywhere, and old-fashioned cloth stockings gradually became obsolete. In recent years, materials have evolved and science has flourished. As a result, there are silk stockings woven with electric machines. According to research, electric machines have been around in Europe and the West for more than ten years. In our country, it is still in its infancy. At that time, although there were more than ten families that purchased them, the new machinery was still a novelty, and it was inevitable that the technology was not refined and there was a lack of talent. As a result, it was a flash in the pan and gradually disappeared. Only a few companies, such as Nanyang Stocking Factory, remain. Nanyang was founded by Cantonese people. Cantonese people have always been known for their good management, so their performance is the best and their products are also refined. They are sold in various provinces and abroad, and their business is developing day by day. Moreover, Mr. Yu Chiring, the director of the factory, has rich knowledge of knitting. He studied in Germany. The recently invented small square heel, dance girl silk stockings, and 320-needle men's silk stockings are particularly distinctive. Mr. Yu said that this kind of small square heel silk stockings is already popular in Europe and the United States. In our country, it is still in its infancy. Now the results are quite good. He is very optimistic about the future of national goods.</p>
<p>Correction In yesterday's article on Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Commemorative Meeting, the word "佳" (good) in the 14th line and the word "次" (next) in the 17th line should be swapped. The two words "淡如" (as light as) in the 22nd line are a mistake for "澹涵" (containing in tranquility). Also, the title of the second section of World Anecdotes, "犯罪" (crime) should be changed to "罪犯" (criminal).</p>
<h3>Random Korean Musings (4)</h3>
<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>Koreans are suffering from Japanese political and economic aggression. It is already extremely miserable. In addition, cultural aggression is a fatal wound to Koreans. Japan annexed Korea just over twenty years ago. Among Koreans under the age of thirty, whether male or female, those who are out of school are of course pitiful. But those who have the opportunity to study receive a slave education, which is even more pitiful. Most of those over thirty who have not received a slave education are still self-aware, believing that these young people are completely assimilated by Japan, which is indeed extremely dangerous. However, how many of these young people understand the advantages and disadvantages of this situation?</p>
<p>When I was in Seoul, I investigated the general situation of education in Korea. In Seoul, there is the Imperial University, as well as specialized schools for law, medicine, commerce, and industry, totaling four. There are fifteen secondary schools and over a hundred elementary schools. Most of them are run by the Japanese and, of course, implement their special educational policies. There are occasional schools established by Koreans themselves, but they must all follow the curriculum promulgated by the Governor-General's Bureau of Education. Courses mainly focus on Japanese, and the native Korean language, writing, and history are severely restricted. Therefore, most young students today speak fluent Japanese and write excellent Japanese. They even consider using Korean language to be backward and not as fashionable.</p>
<p>There are also special schools in Seoul and Pyongyang that are even more novel than American beggar schools, namely the so-called kisaeng schools. The purpose is to train outstanding female entertainers. The curriculum focuses on music, dance, social skills, and makeup. The course of study is stipulated to be four years. The students in these two schools are thriving, and their graduates occupy a significant position in the prostitution industry. The Japanese established such schools to cater to the psychology of social figures and as a policy to deal with Korea. They want to promote this kind of education, making the general public indulge in female allure, numbing the youth, and dividing the Korean spirit of striving for progress. The sharpness of their intentions is conceivable. A friend once told me, "Four or five years ago, Korea launched an independence movement. People everywhere showed fierce resistance. Students from the Pyongyang Kisaeng School also participated in the demonstrations." They also know that fighting for national freedom is much more glorious than the current majority of young people who are living a life of drunken stupor.</p>

<h3>??? (21)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>How could Ziliang be willing to take it? If his own head doesn't hurt, why would he take headache medicine? There is no such reason. So he remained silent, not moving at all. His wife also felt that he couldn't take it and had to save him:</p>
<p>"If you don't take it now, you can take it in the evening!"</p>
<p>"This medicine is also very effective for menstrual pain!"</p>
<p>Ms. Ye said to his wife. The internal medicine was transferred to gynecology. Ziliang felt that categorizing his headache with menstruation was too impolite.</p>
<p>After a pause, Ms. Ye changed the subject:</p>
<p>"It's been less than a year since I came to Shanghai, and things are very different, Mr. Pan! Do you know mahjong? Can you take me somewhere to learn it? I feel like if I don't learn this thing, I'll definitely be left behind."</p>
<p>"To be honest, I don't know how to play."</p>
<p>Ziliang answered humbly, and his wife interjected:</p>
<p>"That foreign game is meaningless, just a temporary fad. I advocate promoting domestic products. Since you rarely come here today, let's play mahjong!"</p>
<p>Ziliang was extremely anxious. Playing mahjong would not only make it impossible to work today but might also drag others down, so he had to try his best to sabotage it:</p>
<p>"No, we don't have enough people!"</p>
<p>"We have three people here. We can invite Mrs. Jiang from next door, and that will make it four."</p>
<p>His wife suggested. Ziliang thought to himself, "I really can't escape, and they're going to invite Mrs. Jiang from next door." Mrs. Jiang is probably in her forties, and her voice is louder than a young Tatar. With these three ladies together, I won't be able to sleep tonight. Absolutely not! I'd better make up a lie:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Jiang went to Minhang this morning."</p>

<h3>Gold Rush Rages Endlessly</h3>
<p>18 taels and 9 qian higher than Saturday</p>
<h3>Exceeding 50 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 13th, the gold standard suddenly soared. The market situation reached its peak, showing a momentum of advancing a thousand miles a day. The difference between the highest and lowest prices in the market was 15 to 16 taels. However, the fluctuations were not significant, with rapid advances and slow declines. As a result, the price surged by 19 taels. The industry's sentiment was high, but buying and selling were uneven. As for the silver market, it was reported to have fallen yesterday, probably because Germany's loan from England and France failed, and the gold price immediately soared. Subsequently, the foreign exchange rate still felt favorable, and the listed price also narrowed by one level. Therefore, it continued to rise upstream, with unparalleled sharpness. The buyers were agile, reaching 747-48 taels at one point. However, hedgers and others sold off, totaling about 34 taels. The market was stable and then declined again. Later, the exchange rate became even higher, and major players bravely competed to buy, causing the price to soar into the sky, actually approaching above 750 taels. The atmosphere in the market was very good. Today's forecast is that the main trend will continue to fall, with multiple parties working hard to raise the price, while the short sellers are under unexpected pressure.</p>
<h3>Market Opens with Immediate Surge</h3>
<p>From the early morning, the August opening price immediately rose by 7 taels and 6 qian, to 737 taels and 5 qian. The main trend had already fallen by one-eighth according to the telegram from the day before yesterday, and the public and private telegrams for the silver price also showed a decline of one-eighth. It then retreated to 36 taels, due to the sales by Yuan Mao Yong, Wan Xing, and Shun Li. In a short while, Heng Xing Yuan, Fu Yu, Yuan Cheng Yong, Bing Xing, and others came to buy in, and with the initial settlement of British gold at 375, then 25 to 1875, it rose again to 45 and a half taels. However, with the sales by Yuan Heng and others, and the sale of British gold at 25 by the Japanese Commercial Bank, it declined again to 40 taels and 5 qian. When the British gold price was announced to have narrowed by 25, and the US dollar by 5 jiao, and the Japanese gold added 2 and a half fen, it immediately rose to 42 and a half taels. Shun Li, Wan Xing, and others bought in slightly, but with the sales by Qian Chang Xiang, Fu Yu, and Tong Tai Chang, combined with the sale of British gold by HSBC, still at 25, and the inter-bank trading of recent US dollars at 30 yuan and 875, it fell back by 3 taels. Near 10 o'clock, it rebounded to 40 taels and 5 qian. Afterward, the buying sentiment was vigorous, with Zhi Feng Yong and other goods entering the market, jumping more than 5 taels, reaching 46 taels at 10:20 am. This was due to the British gold being settled at 1875 to 25, then only 1875. After seven or eight minutes, there were slightly more sellers, cutting off 2 and a half taels, to 43 and a half taels. After 10:30 am, it turned upward again. Wan Xing Shun Li, as well as Bing Xing, Yong Feng, and Yuan Cheng, all sold off. Because the British gold only settled at 125, the market situation soared. Reaching 48 taels at 11:10 am. Subsequently, due to sales by HSBC and others, with August-September British gold at 125 to 1875, and the selling by Da De Cheng, Qian Chang Xiang, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao, Yuan Xing Yong, and others, it fell back by 4 taels, with only a little upward momentum. But the Indian exchange rate was slightly lower, and it was not affected. The market closed at 43 taels and 8 qian at noon, continuing to trade up to 3 taels. The quoted price was changed to 783 taels. It was calculated that the price was pressed down from 40 taels to 43 taels, with the noon close at 40 taels.</p>
<h3>Afternoon Market Feels Even Sharper</h3>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 43 taels and 5 qian, followed by fluctuations of more than 1 tael, ranging from 45 taels to 43 and a half taels. However, the Indian exchange rate was reported to be slightly lower at 3 annas, and there were rumors of the bankruptcy of a very large bank in Germany. This boosted confidence, and the price immediately rose to 45 and a half taels. Suddenly, Zhi Feng Yong and Tai Xing came to sell, causing a sharp drop of more than 4 taels, falling to 40 taels and 8 qian after 2:30 pm. As for British gold, it was flat, with inter-bank trading at 1875 to 25. Later, the market situation turned upward again, with HSBC buying September British gold at 1875 to 25, and Shun Li, Heng Yu, and Wan Xing buying in. At 3:00 pm, it was 44 taels, with a retreat of more than 2 taels. After 3:30 pm, it rose frequently, with a tendency to soar a thousand feet. Tong Feng Heng, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Yu, Qian Chang Xiang, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Cheng, Cui Chang Yong, Yong Feng, and others competed fiercely to buy, creating a surging storm, soaring more than 10 taels. The British gold only settled at 125. Nearing the close, it was 50 taels. It was briefly suppressed to 48 and a half taels. At 4:30 pm, the market closed at 48 taels and 8 qian, an increase of 18 taels and 9 qian compared to last Saturday. However, the buyers were still strong, pushing the price back up to 52 taels, then to 51 taels. The sharpness of the market was unexpected. According to the daily high of 50 taels and low of 36 taels, there was a difference of 14 taels (according to the listed price).</p>
<h3>Tianjin Gang Continues to Handle Bare Gold</h3>
<p>The morning market for bare gold was 37 taels, the noon close was 43 taels and 3 qian, the afternoon was 4 taels, and the close was 50 taels. The quoted price was calculated to be pressed down from 40 taels to 34 taels. The recorded prices were 47 taels to 44 taels in the morning and 52 taels to 49 taels in the afternoon. Both morning and afternoon markets were double-settled, with a water replenishment of 47 taels and 52 taels in the afternoon. Several hundred taels of spot bare gold were handled by the Tianjin Gang, sold by Ying Feng Heng, with the price increasing by 11 taels and 7 qian and 5.</p>
<h3>Mixed Trading Among Industry Players</h3>
<p>Statistics for various companies: Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Xing Yuan, Shun Li, Cui Chang Yong, Yu Da, Yuan Tai, and Fu Tai Heng all bought in. Fu Yu, Heng Yu, Bing Xing, Yuan Xing Yong, and Da Xing Yong had very frequent transactions. Cheng Feng Yong, Yuan Heng, and Fu Chang sold out for hedging purposes. Wan Xing, Run Tai Chang, and Yuan Mao Yong had more supply than demand. Qian Chang Xiang sold out. In the afternoon, Yuan Mao Yong sold and then bought back in. Da De Cheng, Zhi Feng Yong, Wan Xing, and Shun Li bought and sold alternately. Yuan Tai, Yuan Cheng, Cui Chang Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Tong Feng Heng, Yong Feng, Fu Tai Heng, and Tong Tai Chang generally bought in, with larger amounts. Tai Xing and small investors sold out. The Guangdong gang watched from the sidelines. The Dalian gang followed their own paths, with a total of more than 6,000 taels, generally balancing out, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed prices were all narrowed by one level, because the silver market continued to report declines the day before. British gold was narrowed by 25, now at one shilling and three pence. US dollars were halved, calculated at 30 yuan and 375. Japanese gold was increased by 2 and a half fen, to one tael and six qian and two and a half fen. However, Hong Kong did not change, still calculated at 80 taels and 125. The other exchange rates were also narrowed, probably because the domestic market trend was very tight, with an almost continuous upward trend. The gold market broke through 750 taels, mainly because the German loan had many twists and turns and was difficult to achieve in the short term, leading to heightened sentiment. The results were compared to last Saturday, with British gold narrowed by 375, US dollars narrowed by 8125, and Japanese gold rose by 3 and 75. Chinese gold firms vigorously shorted to offset previous short positions, selling out gold. However, HSBC did not relent in its selling intentions, and Chinese and Japanese banks also sold. British gold transactions amounted to 4-500,000 pounds, and US dollar transactions amounted to 300,000 yuan. American silver companies bought in slightly, while Japanese gold only had tens of thousands of yuan in transactions. The market atmosphere was said to be improving.</p>

<h3>Call Loan Market Quiet</h3>

<p>Although yesterday was the beginning of the week, unlike the previous busy times, the situation was not very strong. Currently, it is summer, and all businesses are generally slow, lacking a lively and active atmosphere. The financial sector, in particular, is more idle than other industries. Therefore, although yesterday was Monday, it was quiet and peaceful, with no significant momentum to speak of. Various prices were also in a state of flatness, and news of bank deposits and withdrawals was also scarce. This shows the calmness of the market.</p>

<h3>Securities: '20 Customs Bonds' Tumble by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The Remaining Also Fall by Six, Seven Jiao to One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, although there were several types of spot public bonds offered, transactions were as scarce as before. The futures market was very quiet in the morning, with few people around. In the afternoon, the market became more active as bond prices fell sharply. As for the changing situation, the morning saw balanced buying and selling, so prices were weak but fluctuations were still flat. In the afternoon, sentiment suddenly turned weak, and sellers became active. Due to the relationship between supply and demand, the prices of all bonds fell sharply. Among them, the '20 Customs Bonds' fell the most due to higher supply. The July bonds fell sharply by 2 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, and the August futures and '20 Bonds' August also fell by about 2 yuan. '19 Good Small' fell by 1 yuan, and the other bonds fell by about 7-8 jiao. Only the 'Seven-Year' bonds rose slightly. The spot 'Customs Duties' rose back by 2 yuan and 1 jiao compared to mid-last month. According to yesterday's market news, the decline in bond prices is related to the upcoming auction of unified tax treasury bills, it is said. Total spot transactions for the day were 7 xing yuan, 7.5 million in the morning futures, and 9 million in the afternoon, totaling over 16.67 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Sees Light at the End of the Tunnel</h3>
<p>Boycott Atmosphere Triggers Buyers</p>
<p>Speculation Heats Up, Market Trends Upward</p>
<p>The yarn market's upward trend is drastic, probably because after the Wanbaoshan Incident, there were deep fears of triggering a boycott movement. As a result, the atmosphere in the commercial market was unusually pervasive, and people's minds were extremely tense. Buyers flocked in, so the market trended upward step by step. At the same time, actual sales were stimulated, and northern buyers were particularly enthusiastic, further heating up the atmosphere. Later, speculators bought in large quantities, making the market even tighter. However, one major merchant sold 12-3,000 bales alone. The future situation is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Human Bidding Soars by Three Taels</h3>
<p>The market atmosphere at the opening of the exchange's human bidding was tight, with strong buying intentions. All months rose by 1-2 taels. In the afternoon, it rose again by 6-9 qian to 1 tael. Transactions totaled 67,350 bales. Rong Xing sold 7,000 bales, Minghua 5,900 bales, Tong Xing 1,000 bales, Shun Da 1,350 bales, and Xinhua 5,050 bales.

<h3>Various Reasons for Rising Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>Gold Prices Soar… Yarn Market Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Continuous Rainy Days… Harmful to Cotton Seedlings</p>
<p>The situation of American cotton is flat, but the atmosphere in this city's cotton market is very tense. The soaring gold prices and sharp rise in the yarn market have caused people's minds to tighten. Moreover, the continuous rain has caused floods in various regions, and it is said that cotton seedlings in the production areas have been washed away. Therefore, there are more buyers than sellers, and new sellers are all at a loss, resulting in an excited market rise.</p>
<h3>Hankow Standard Cotton Rises by Four Mace Externally</h3>

<p>English and Indian Cotton Industry Weekly Report</p>
<h3>Bombay</h3>
<p>Last week, market prices did not fall as much as American cotton, resulting in a narrower price ratio. The July Omra cotton was particularly strong, with only 4,300 bales delivered, due to good demand from Japanese shippers. The situation was similar for Pingguo'er cotton, with current inventories not being thick, especially for superior grades. In the spot market, Gandhi fake and Pilar were most popular, followed by Bairuo Creek and Taolela. Inquiries from continental Europe seemed disappointing. The weekly statistics are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>Year 1930	Year 1931</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1	3,384	3,279</p>
<p>Weekend inventory	1,094	854</p>
<p>Cumulative exports since September 1	2,266	2,221</p>
<p>Exports to Europe	806	555</p>
<p>Exports to China	372	392</p>
<p>Exports to Japan	1,030	1,250</p>
<p>Other regions	58	24</p>
<h3>Liverpool</h3>
<p>Spot sales were moderate last week, with prices flat. The futures market was active, with prices falling sharply due to continental bulls liquidating positions, good weather for American cotton, and political  meetings issuing reports different from the bears. The decline eased slightly at the weekend, but the market remained volatile. Egyptian cotton followed American cotton's fluctuations. Rice prices in Liangshi River market rose repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Xinzha</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was alternately cloudy and sunny. The amount of new rice reaching the Xiangluo road end decreased day by day. Sales by various groups started smoothly but then slackened. Early in the morning, thick粳 rice from the coastal areas was eagerly sought due to concerns about mildew, resulting in strong buying interest. However, prices were later raised, causing buyers to become more cautious. Changshu and Xixi's top-grade 粳 rice rose by two chi. Arrivals of thin稻 rice lacked takers, and prices continued to increase gradually. Limited retail sales of LuJian rice were quite active. Arrivals of imported rice were slightly scarce, and the situation caused a rise of half a chi. Imports of foreign rice gradually decreased, while rural sales increased. Prices were one or two chi higher than in the previous market. Sales of mildewed glutinous rice were two less than arrivals, with no price changes.</p>
<h3>South Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals were scarce, and transactions in urban and rural areas became more active. Su Tong's thick 粳 rice was bid up by one or two chi. Customers from Chongming and Hai'an inquired about Chang Xi's top-grade 粳 rice, but the quantities were small and sporadic, so the price only increased by one chi or so. Qingjiao, Si Song, Feng Lian, and other thin稻 rice continued to arrive, and sales were extremely good, with prices rising by two chi. Du Yang's rice market was tight, and after a long period of fatigue, sales were greatly boosted. Local retail sales were quite active, also up by one chi. Sales of the Tongbian mildewed rice were two less than arrivals, with a stable market. Although early rice was available on the market, the quantity was not large, and prices remained high. The amount of river clams opened was two or three thousand tan.</p>
<h3>Mildew and Rain Drive Flour Prices Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally trended towards firmness, due to continuous mildew and rain, causing various places to become swamplands, naturally affecting crops. As flour is also a staple food, outside investors were in a good mood, and buying interest was high. On the mill side, some mills had retracted recent positions, while others were selling distant positions. In Tianjin, only three yuan was sold for the soldiers' rations, with daily sales only reaching around 30,000. Sales of other brands were also flat, so this price increase had little to do with reality, but was only caused by the excessive flooding raising people's expectations. As a result, this month was 1.75% better than the previous week, August was 1.25% better, September was 1.5% better, October was 1.75% better, November was 1.25% better, and December was 1.5% better.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Trading Flat, Up One Mace and Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from the sugar producing areas. The association's trading was flat, and due to the rising exchange rate, market sentiment was even better, and demand was strong. As the market rose, the transaction price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 10 taels, 0.085 to 0.09 yuan. High-quality, coarse-grained sugar was 11 taels and 0.05 yuan, and was scarce upon leaving the warehouse. The price was bid up to 11 taels and 0.01 yuan in the afternoon, and the trend was bullish. Japanese sugar prices also rose sharply, with N mark at 10 taels, 0.08 to 0.0875 yuan, and the highest price for new goods reaching 10 taels and 0.09 yuan. SH mark was 10 taels and 0.07 yuan, TM mark was 10 taels, 0.075 to 0.08 yuan, J mark was 11 taels and 0.02 yuan, TX mark was 10 taels, 0.0825 to 0.09 yuan, YT mark was 10 taels, 0.0775 to 0.085 yuan, and EZ mark was 10 taels and 0.055 yuan. Trading was very active, the market was firm, and there was a general trend towards a gradual rise.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Xin Zhong Xing Vegetables Not Arrived Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Xin Zhong Xing's daylily was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, but according to a telegram from Zhenjiang, due to continuous mildew and rain, it has not yet arrived in Zhenjiang. It is expected that it will not be available for three to five days. However, the harvest in the producing areas is abundant, and the market price in the future will definitely be flat. The Da Xing vegetables have not yet been weighed due to banditry in the producing areas and cautious observation by buyers, so the arrival will be further delayed.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Jiangsu Summer Cocoon Market Increasingly Sluggish</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Production Almost Exhausted...Few Cocoon Shops Open</p>
<p>In the counties of Ningzhen, Changzhou, Wuxi, Chengxiang, and Suzhou in Jiangsu Province, the amount of summer silkworms raised this year was not weak. After the silkworm eggs hatched, the weather was sunny and warm, and the silkworms developed smoothly. However, during the major sleep stage, there was continuous mildew and rain, with sudden hot and cold spells, and silkworm diseases were rampant. Seven or eight out of ten silkworms suffered from black rot, yellow pus, and stiff paralysis. The cocoon production in various regions was almost exhausted, with statistics showing only one or two percent of a normal year's production. Moreover, due to excessive rainwater, the quality of the cocoons was generally poor. Cocoon shops in various regions have not officially opened, and Wuxi and other places are only receiving cocoons as they arrive. The highest price for cocoons is 50 yuan, with an average of about 40 yuan. This year's summer cocoons in Jiangsu Province are no longer marketable. The loss to farmers is even greater than that of spring silkworms, and everyone is complaining bitterly.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silk Telegrams Not Transmitted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market was almost at a standstill. The European and American markets and Chinese silk mills were mostly inactive. Silk telegrams were not transmitted, and European firms suppressed prices and hoarded inventory. Chinese merchants were passive. Yesterday, only Kai Li imported five bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk and Samsung and others imported ten bales of yellow coarse silk, with prices remaining flat.</p>
<h3>Needle Embroidery, Fine Eyebrow Tea Sales Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm tea market saw strong interest from French firms in needle embroidery, fine eyebrow tea, and other green teas arriving from various routes. There was also some activity in mid- to low-grade precious eyebrow and pearl tea. The overall market was quite active, but the selling price of Gongxi tea was consistently falling, becoming increasingly sluggish in recent days. The Russian firm's aid association is still indefinitely postponed, and the White Head firm has little appetite, with over 10,000 boxes already stockpiled in the market. There have also been no major transactions in black teas from Qining and other routes in recent days, and market prices are about 78 taels lower than before.</p>
<h3>Metal Standards See a Resurgence of Price Increases</h3>
<p>Although the metal market did not see any progress yesterday, prices rose again due to the tight exchange rate and high market sentiment. Eighteen-sheet black-headed skin was estimated at 11 taels and 5 mace per picul, and 70 to 80 piculs were opened yesterday, but there were more inquiries than before. Tinplate was also bid up by 0.025 yuan. British goods were 15 taels for 90 pounds, 15 taels and 0.075 yuan for 100 pounds, American goods were 16 taels and 0.075 yuan for 90 pounds, 17 taels and 0.035 yuan for 100 pounds, 200-pound company iron was 31 taels and 0.05 yuan, and 35-pound thin iron was 46 taels. Following the price increase, the market also offered Ma brand barrel heads at 4 taels and 0.045 yuan, bag heads at 4 taels and 0.005 yuan, and Elephant brand at 4 taels and 0.035 yuan (barrel heads), with bag goods estimated at 4 taels. White lead sheet, plain white iron, corrugated iron, and English steel plates all showed signs of prosperity.

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<h3>Memoirs of Li Bu-lan</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>Originally, literary figures often have love stories. Maeterlinck was no exception. When a woman he didn't know was infatuated with him after reading his work and expressed her love to him, and he happened to be in need of such things, he couldn't help but accept it. But who knew that after twenty years of marriage and cohabitation, they would divorce due to various misfortunes, each with a wounded heart, going their separate ways. For Maeterlinck, it may have been just a momentary impulse at the time, but for that woman, how could she have anticipated such a dramatic scene today? The protagonist is none other than Georgette Leblanc.</p>
<p>Li Bu-lan was deeply moved after reading Maeterlinck's famous works, *Princesse Maleine* and *Pelléas et Mélisande*, leaving a profound impression on her soul. She believed that the ideal character she had in mind was just like the characters described in those two books in terms of their personality and social status. As a result, she couldn't help but fantasize, and boldly expressed her love to Maeterlinck, eventually marrying him. This marriage, in anyone's eyes, would certainly be considered perfect. At the time, the literary and art circles widely spread the news, and countless people envied them. However, happiness ultimately turned to sorrow. The Maeterlinck in her ideal and the Maeterlinck after marriage were vastly different. In the end, she abandoned twenty years of cohabitation and agreed to a divorce.</p>
<p>Recently, Li Bu-lan, for some unknown reason, wrote a book, with a style similar to a memoir, openly describing the story of the combination of literary and marriage ties. However, the writing is quite calm and solemn, without revealing any frivolity, and even words of resentment are not lightly expressed. Although between the lines, she inevitably overflows with how different her impression of Maeterlinck after marriage is from her dreams before marriage. The description is very delicate, and the style is like her person. One wonders what Maeterlinck will think when he reads it. At the moment, this book has attracted the attention of the European and American literary circles.</p>
<h3>Oriental Journal</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>Tokyo, First Volume</p>
<p>Since the publication of the "Oriental Journal Kyoto First Volume" by the Kyoto Research Institute of Oriental Culture, it has attracted the attention of the general public. The Japanese are conducting such detailed research, ostensibly in the name of academic exploration, but there must be ulterior motives. However, their spirit is truly worthy of our admiration. They are not making efforts in superficial areas at all, and they are not afraid of difficulties in actually analyzing China's society, politics, economy, culture, geography, and history. They place even greater emphasis on tracing back Chinese history. Looking back at our own country, we are deficient, which is shameful. The organization of the Oriental Culture Institute is well-known because of its extensive activities in China.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Research Institute is one of its branches. The research is separate, but the affiliation is the same. The content of this Tokyo First Volume is roughly similar to that of the Kyoto First Volume. All the styles and titles are the same as the Kyoto volume. It is headed by Dr. Hattori Unokichi, Director of the Tokyo Research Institute. Now, the research topics of the seventeen researchers are listed below to show the general nature of their research projects:</p>
<p>Chinese Architectural Decoration – Ito Chuta</p>
<p>Historical and Chemical Research on Ancient Chinese Currency – Kato Shigeru, Domo Tsurumatsu</p>
<p>Research on Chu Ci Literature – Koki Sadakichi</p>
<p>Research on Successive Chinese Emperors – Go Ya Sadatakeshima Takuichi</p>
<p>Culture of the Khitans in Manchuria and Mongolia Before History and the Liao Dynasty – Torii Ryuzo</p>
<p>Correction of the Zheng Commentary on the Book of Etiquette – Hattori Unokichi</p>
<p>Restoration of the Tang Ordinances and Historical Research – Niida Noboru</p>
<p>Research on the System of Consciousness-Only Doctrine – Yuki Reimon</p>
<p>Ancient Central Asian Art (with special emphasis on painting) – Matsumoto Eiichi, Mitsugi Sasayoshi</p>
<p>Research on Chinese Family System (with special emphasis on the inheritance system) – Makino Tatsumi</p>
<p>Compilation of the Index to the Place Names in the Reading History to Survey the Territory – Aoyama Sadao</p>
<p>Compilation of the Illustrated Catalog of Ancient Chinese Artifacts – Harada Yoshito, Komai Kazuchika</p>
<p>The following articles are collected in this volume:</p>
<p>On the Various Alaya-Consciousness Theories in the Tang Dynasty Centered on the Treatise on the Establishment of Consciousness-Only – Yuki Reimon</p>
<p>A Study on the Year of Production of the Annotation to the Tang Law (Part 1) – Niida Noboru, Makino Tatsumi</p>
<p>Ancient Chinese Chemical Thought (Elemental Thought) – Domo Tsurusha</p>
<p>Shell Mounds Near Huanglong County, Shandong Province – Komai Kazuchika</p>
<p>Observing the Ancient State of Chu from the Perspective of Cultural History – Osa Kitasu</p>
<p>The report includes the establishment, current situation, and undertakings of the Research Institute, as well as Torii Ryuzo's lecture, "Travels in Manchuria and Mongolia." Each article has brilliant and unique insights. Such research is truly chilling to us.</p>
<p>Readers who want to know more about the content and observe its research achievements may wish to buy a copy. It is sold by Bunkyudo at 1-chome, Hongo, Tsujimoto-Hongo, Tokyo, Japan, and is priced at two Japanese yen. There is no Chinese translation available yet.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to add one more sentence, that is, the reason why I want to provide this magazine is to hope that the Chinese academic community will not allow others to take the lead, and instead abandon our own things. How practical are their research topics!</p>

<h3>Recent World Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Deming</p>
<p>Recent Trends in the French Art Scene</p>
<p>The French art scene has been in a relatively calm state recently. Even the Salon d'Automne, which has always been known for its revolutionary art, has shown signs of relaxation. Is this a good phenomenon or a bad one? We dare not make a hasty judgment. However, it is probably an inevitable trend to move from excessive excitement to fatigue.</p>
<p>Book Illustration</p>
<p>There is a bookstore owner in France named Ambroise Vollard. He has a great appreciation for art. He invites famous painters to create illustrations for famous literary works and publishes them. Thirty years ago, he printed two masterpieces by the great poet Verlaine. The illustrations were made by the great painter Bonnard. Now these two books have become rare editions. In addition, he has published several famous literary works illustrated by Rodin, Maurice Denis, and Bernard. Now he has invited several great painters such as Picasso, Rouault, Laprade, Dufy, and Chagall to collaborate on book illustrations. When these books are published in the future, they will surely become the most beautiful things in the publishing world.</p>
<p>"Three-Faced Views"</p>
<p>"Glaces à Trois Faces" is the name of a recent exhibition held in Paris. Why is it called "Three-Faced Views"? It turned out to be a collection of portraits of the same model by several painters, three by each person, and exhibited. The painters are the great Impressionists Renoir, Berthe Morisot, Mary Cassatt, Vuillard, and Despian. This exhibition is very interesting. From it, we see a very interesting point, that is, modern art pays attention to the subjective. Therefore, although the painters above painted portraits of the same model, the resulting portraits are not similar at all. If you ask several photographer-style painters to paint portraits of the same person, then the results they get will definitely be exactly the same.</p>
<p>New Buildings in the Berlin Museum</p>
<p>The Berlin Museum is the largest and most comprehensive museum in the world. Recently, many new buildings have been added there. This new construction began around 1901, designed and supervised by Alfred Messel, an architect at the time. Later, after Messel passed away, Ludwig Hoffman continued the construction. The project was suspended during the war. After the war, construction was resumed several years later. By the end of last year, all the buildings were completed. The most important of these new buildings are replicas of ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman buildings. The styles and sizes of these reproduced buildings are exactly the same as the originals. The purpose of this kind of construction is to allow people who do not have the opportunity to go to the locations of those ancient sites to appreciate their semblance. It is indeed needed by the public. However, this kind of construction is very expensive, and there are many difficulties in terms of engineering. Only the Germans have the courage to do it. People from other countries dare not try it easily.</p>
<p>New Art Institution in Poland</p>
<p>Recently, a new art institution has been established in Poland, called the "Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts." The purpose of that institution is to arouse public attention and understanding of various pure and applied arts. That institution started working in July last year. At that time, they held exhibitions in two lively summer resorts. However, their first important work was the recent exhibition of peasant art held in Warsaw. Peasant art is the art of the people, and it is of course the easiest to arouse public interest.</p>
<p>Finnish Architectural Art</p>
<p>The Finns pay extraordinary attention to architecture. There are several buildings there that can be said to be the most novel and outstanding in the modern architectural world. It turns out that that side is the embryonic land of futurist architectural art.</p>
<p>The most famous modern Finnish architect is Gottlieb Elieb Saarinen, who was born in Rantasalm in 1873. His masterpieces are the train stations in Hekingfors (Helsinki, the capital of Finland) and Wiborg. Lar Soncki is also an outstanding architect. The reason why the Finnish architectural school is famous all over the world and its influence extends to all countries is due to the work of those two great architects.</p>
<h3>After Seeing the Works of the Students of the Shanghai Art College</h3>
<p>— Chen Baoyi</p>
<p>This is the art exhibition of the graduating class of the Shanghai Art College in the twentieth year. It is a pity that the exhibition period is a bit late, but it is said that there are still quite a few enthusiastic people who brave the heat, sweat, and wander around the exhibition venue.</p>
<p>The exhibits are mainly the homework and graduation works of most of the students. Oil paintings account for the majority. In addition, for reference, there are some works by writers who have joined from outside, as well as several works by the professors.</p>
<p>The general situation of this art exhibition, I think, has been known to those who have visited, and it is natural that everyone has their own viewpoints… Now, I will just record a few words on my personal impressions of the works of the young people.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, it is a pity that there is no formal painting exhibition venue. Therefore, their works can only be displayed in the classrooms of the school. All the works are spread over six exhibition rooms of various sizes. Because there are so many points and the space is not enough, the distance between the paintings is inevitably too close. Visitors feel this shortcoming.</p>
<p>Most of the works give people a sense of brightness, which is slightly different from the gloomy works seen in the past. However, the so-called "tendency" is not like following military orders, doing the same work together in the same way, but seems to have the purpose of different paths leading to the same goal. Each person, according to their own qualities, is moving forward towards the vast "art journey." It also seems that when preparing for a difficult long journey, it is very important to pay attention to one's own health and physical strength. It seems that they are all aware of checking their "artistic health and physical strength."</p>
<p>Enough small talk, let's talk about their works.</p>
<p>Starting from the first room and looking at them in order... then Yang Taiyang's "Self-Portrait", Chen Zhuotang's "Still Life", Zeng Xiaolian's small "Nude" and "Landscape", Xie Chao's "Snow Scene", "North Station", Cui Zhenjie's pencil "Self-Portrait", HF Dai's "Dusk", Liao Feilai's "Bridge in Suzhou", "Suzhou Causeway", Li Zhongsheng's "Watercolor Still Life" (No. 3) "Oil Painting Still Life", Du Chaowen's "Landscape", Hu Changqi's "Lingyin Ancient Temple", Liang Xihong's "Landscape", "Dusk", "Flower Shop", Xia Yifang's "Landscape Next to the School", "In Front of the Courtyard"... Yong Tingguang's "Nude", "Spring in West Lake", Wang Shuren's "Nude", Du Shiqi's "After the Rain in West Lake", "Nude", etc., Zeng Zhiliang's "Nude with Socks", "ABC", "Little Rest", "Street", etc., Chen Zhuotang's "Flower", "Reclining Nude", etc., Yang Qiuren's "Self-Portrait", "Lake", "Maadolsne" and several other points, Yang Guangyang's "After the Rain", "Qixia Mountain Road", "Spring Painting" and several other points, and HF Dai's "Early Summer", "Corner of the Riverside", Liao Feilai's "Landscape of Hangzhou", etc. are all excellent works. There are several others, but it is too troublesome to describe them all, so I will omit them.</p>
<p>From the excellent works, you can also extract a few examples to briefly describe their characteristics...</p>
<p>Chen Zhuotang... likes to use dark and astringent colors. The so-called "dark and astringent color" here does not refer to a kind of gloomy and turbid color, but a kind of color that contains beautiful harmony in the dark and astringent. In terms of color tone, he seems to be groping for this kind of beauty. Works such as "Reclining Nude", "Flower", and "Still Life" all show this characteristic. In terms of expression, it is also straightforward and powerful.</p>
<p>In contrast to the above, there are the works of Yang Linren and Yang Taiyang. Although the styles of the two gentlemen are particularly different, they both use bright colors.</p>
<p>Yang Qiuren... the color tone is bright and beautiful without being mixed, showing a more delicate feeling. For example, the large "Lying Woman", "Self-Portrait", "Spring on Suzhou Causeway", River "Lake", etc. are examples for people to see.</p>
<p>Yang Taiyang... the color tone is bright and fresh, the brushwork is quite strong and has a Rhythmical momentum, and it has abundant power. For example, the nude depicted with Naples Yellow, full of Modele (flesh)... "After Drinking", and the use of large round brushstrokes to depict the moist green of trees and distant mountains, "Qixia Mountain Road", the picture is very thick and has a fresh feeling. In addition, such as "Male Image", "Little Rest", "Miss L", etc., all show their bright characteristics.</p>
<p>Du Shiqi... the brushwork is powerful and the colors have a beauty of calmness. Compared with the above examples, it has its own unique characteristics. Among his works, such as "After the Rain in West Lake", is painted with black and calm colors. The line drawing in the painting is quite beautiful and precise. The rest, such as "Landscape of West Lake", "Nude", etc., all show the writer's descriptive power.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhiliang's paintings also show bright and strong colors, and have a soft harmony. The brushwork is also careful. However, if he can pay attention to the "strengths and weaknesses" of expression, the effect will be better. Judging from his many works, it can be seen that he is also a diligent person who is rapidly improving. His works, such as "Street", "Little Rest", the large "Girl in Green Dress", "ABC", "Portrait of Sister" (1), etc. are all excellent works... In addition, there are several small works that seem to be futurist, but in terms of futurism, they are a bit weak.</p>
<p>My impressions of the works are as above. Regarding the other works, I will omit them.</p>
<p>…The study of art, of course, is to be tempered with "thought and technology." Because a painter is not just a painter who has only learned a little superficial skill... However, the field of painting is ultimately slightly different from the field of literature, that is, in terms of the "ideological and literary elements," in painting, I also feel that it is necessary to integrate or reflect those "elements" and "expression" into a painting's own "characteristics." It seems that simply focusing on the choice of "subject matter" is a different issue from "characteristics." Is this point to be considered?</p>
<p>The above is just a brief description of what I personally feel about the "works" from the "painting" point of view, so I have not specifically described the "subject matter" from a literary or ideological point of view, partly because my thoughts are very shallow.</p>
<p>Finally... from the works of the young writers seen this time, it is not difficult to predict the brilliance of their future. This is a gratifying thing. However, often due to self-satisfaction or other reasons, it is easy to give up halfway. This is something that we who study art have to pay attention to.</p>
