<h3>日暴行之觀點</h3>
<p>（南京）　近三日訪問歐美各國旅京人士、關於日本暴行之批評與看法、可概括數點如下、（一）日本在遼吉之經濟權、中國並不否認、如合辦鐵路、中國並未聲明不承認、日本遽以兵力占據遼省城及吉林洮南等地、是日本之違背經濟範圍、任何合辦事業、均係商業性質、不能派兵占領、如洮南及吉林等地之進兵、并無理由、因吉敦與四洮借欵契約爲商業的、世界上那有商人之後帶兩假武裝護兵、若商人而帶武裝護兵、試問誰敢親近地、（二）日本在國聯、信誓旦旦、十四前撤於南路區域内、似尙可信、日本旣然爲大國、當然不能在國際聯盟席上撤謊、但恐便衣警察及巡查憲兵等十四尙不能撤盡、因此項日方可諉爲不是軍隊、（三）内地各省之抗日運動、係受日本對遼吉暴行而發生之義憤、與遼吉本問題不生直接影響、日本不當挾排日而延緩撤兵、（四）上海日商爲華人受傭於日方之職工解僱問題、誇大宣傳以爲大難將至、甚至急電朦陳幣原、要求派大部分軍隊到長江、此事甚喪失商人身分、經商於他國者、總以避免藉軍人保鑣爲合理、十年前中國抵制美貨、美商從未請美國派大兵者、日政府此次雖派艦、恐仍不能緩和排貨、因世界上斷無以槍砲脅迫人家與他交易者、（六日）</p>
<h3>中日東北懸案</h3>
<p>（東京）　中日東北懸案共四百餘件、内中有百五十餘關係遼吉主權獨立領土完整甚大、如日本要求打破中國自辦吉海等四鐵路線、與撤銷葫蘆島築港計畫、是超過於日本條約上所取得之權利、故關此數案件、東北交通委員會始終未敢交涉、致有日本此次之硬幹、其中尙有百五十件、爲三省各地方之極小問題、如華韓日人民刑事等案、此類案情、將來可以雙方抵銷完案、日本前並不堅持、尙有數十案、係吾方要求日方辦理者、如萬寳山及鮮案其尤著者、日本應當負重大責任、今國聯對於日本已大爲讓步、將原定派國際委員會同調查一節抛棄、僅令日本退兵於原地、將來由中日當事者交涉、今後中日不能永不交涉、即交涉亦不能稱謂直接交涉、因今後中日間交涉不啻受國聯發下交原被告自行調解性質、故今後國聯仲裁之責任、還未脱卸、國人不能以直接交涉名而攻擊談判、國際法正解如此、（六日專電）</p>
<p>加拉罕</p>
<h3>對莫表示好感</h3>
<p>（北平）　莫斯科電、加拉罕對莫德惠表好感、謂俄絶不派兵入華、萬一增兵遠東、亦係自衛、實無聯日謀華事（六日專電）</p>
<h3>北方財政情形</h3>
<p>二三月内可敷衍</p>
<p>（北平）　北方金融界甚穩定、財源專在關内開支、可敷衍、二三月内無問題、兼管關外則不足、政局一時亦可無變化、（六日專電）</p>

<p>自日軍違反國際公法。對我不宣而戰。以暴力佔據我東北而後。中日兩國之國交與國民情感。已陷於非常惡化之悲觀狀態。實爲不可掩飾之事實。我舉國上下。正竭全力於救濟空前之水災。而日乃乘我之危。一朝之内。遂置我東北半壁山河於暴力刧持之下。財帛被掠取。人民被戮辱。儼然以敵對行爲相對待。此爲國際間何等重大何等不可忍受之事件。我國當事者。内困於水災。外爲遵守國聯盟約及非戰公約。忍辱負重。絶無抵抗。我舉國民衆。憤於暴行之有加無已。怵於滅亡之迫近眉睫。爲救國自救計。自動奮起。以有計劃有紀律之嚴整步武。以非武力抵抗之悲壯態度。對日經濟不合作。以促起日本朝野之覺悟。改變其對華侵略方針。此爲有血氣有人格之國民所應有之舉動。抑且爲抗暴自衛必採之手段揆諸公理與正義。絶無再受干涉之餘地。乃觀五日日閣議之决議。對我國目前排日運動。竟提出所謂嚴重警告。無理抗辯横肆恫嚇此種抗議。適足以證明日人爲蹂躙公理之魔鬼。適足以激厲我舉國人民奮鬥精神之愈益堅决。</p>
<p>歷年來中國人民何以「動輒排。日」最近「特别敵視並實行報復的排日運動。」何以引起。任何人應都能明其爲日人歷年對華侵略以及最近暴力侵佔我東北之反應。此種極明顯之因果關係。日人何遂不能體認明白。何遂不一反省操白刃以切人之咽喉而欲人無息無聲。不一撑拒。甚且忍死以表示友善能乎不能。日人其一自思。</p>
<p>試檢閲過去之歷史。我國每一次排日運動之發生。何莫非日人高壓之反應。日人口唱親善和平。數十年來如一日。而對我侵略。亦數十年如一日。民二之南京事件。民三之據我青島與膠濟鐵路。民四之二十一條。民六之干涉我國參戰。民八之長春事件。民九之渾春慘案。民十二之乘地震慘殺華僑。民十五之砲擊我大沽口。民十七之濟南慘案。今年之萬案。韓案以及最近暴力襲取我東北。舊創未平。新痛又加。血痕疊。徧體皆是。歷數往事。日人之加諸我者爲親善乎。抑爲侵略乎。田中義一之奏稿。陰謀顯著。若槻内閣最近之演説。音響弦外。南陸相最近之訓誡軍人。敵視我國。更露骨表現。滿洲讀本中一直不認東北爲我國土。其他敎科書中更多鼓勵學生侵略我國。凡茲事實。爲親善乎。抑爲侵略乎。再如日之軍艦密佈我長江。今啣尾而來者猶絡繹不絶。日所藉口者爲保僑。而各地日僑固絶對安全。毫無可慮。其居心所在。爲親善乎。抑爲侵略乎。日人之加之我者如此。而欲我於絶舞抵抗之後。更甘心忍受鐵蹄之踐踏。並表示感謝之忱。吾敢正告日人。具有五千餘年歷史之文明古國國民。雖以國敝。亦决不能接受日人荒謬絶倫之要求。雖至勢窮力盡。亦决不肯放鬆其最後之武器。</p>
<p>當美利堅黑船闖破日本門戶之後。列强紛至要求互市通商。訂立不平等條約。日本人民亦紛起暴動反抗。焚燬外國領館。殺戮外國僑民。今我之抗日。</p>
<p>尙僅限於不合作。僅限於誡勉國人愛護祖國。愛護民族。態度旣和平行爲。尤光明正大。何預日人。而容置啄。施於我者如此。求於我者又如彼。此眞西哲耶穌所謂「只看見他人眼裏的剌。不看見自己眼裏的大樑木。」如日人能拔去自己眼中之大樑木者。吾人拔去眼中之剌。自絲毫不成問題。親善必從事實表現。數十年來中國國民痛深矣。恨極矣。身之所受。一日未敢忘。而日人猶曰「日本從來即努力於助長中日之親善。」自欺欺人。將謂中國國民皆三尺孩提耶。謂世界耳目可以一手掩盡耶。</p>

<h3>于右任</h3>
<p>在中央紀念週之演詞　　國難中之國民黨</p>
<p>中央黨部五日上午九時舉行第一三二次總理紀念週、到中委于右任丁惟汾陳果夫余井塘陳布雷苗培成方覺慧周啟剛陳立夫克興額曁職員來賓共約六百餘人、由丁惟汾主席、領導行禮後、于右任報告、題爲「國難中之本黨與黨員」原文如下、</p>
<p>「中國近來所受的天災人禍、骨憂外患、已到了非常劇迫的時候、全中國乃至全世界的人民都眼睜睜的看着以黨建國以黨治國的中國國民黨怎様從艱難危險中渡過去、並且怎様完成他所負荷的建國治國的責任、所以我今天特别提出國難中之本黨與黨員、來作這次報告的題目、我們中國在革命以前、内受不良政治的壓迫、外受帝國主義的侵襲、人民生計斷絶、而國勢又非常危險、這時候只有革命纔能解放人民、保全國家、但是革命必須有領導者、總理當時與先如先覺者纔以黨的組織來擔負這個領導責任、有了革命的黨、纔能集中意志指導行動、在建立黨的政權之後即以黨的政治力量、實現人民的要求、完成黨的主義、這就是一個革命政黨所負歷史的使命、</p>
<p>本黨爲中國自由平等之故、爲實現人民生活的要求、在整個的革命程途中、實是責無旁貸而必然的要努力領導人民、完成革命的歷史使命、現在國難如此急迫、爲甚麽還談起理論來呢、這因爲有許多人還没有完全看清黨在革命中的作用與意義、所以一當非常事態中、就有些錯誤見解發出、惟其如此、所以在國難中更要特别爲之指出、其一是有人以爲本黨革命後纔有今日之國難、這眞是錯誤太大了、帝國主義的侵略、本是無遠弗届、也是無孔不入的、難道中國不革命、帝國主義就不來侵略麽、我敢斷言、中國不革命、國難必更甚於今日、</p>
<p>其次、是有些人以爲本黨之訓政時期、人民對於國事、太無權力了、因本黨有類於包辦、使人民不能直接盡責、所以外患乃乘隙而至、由此有人懷疑黨治、遂發爲還政國民之説、他們絶没有想到黨的訓政、正爲要使人民由此進入憲政時期、道時候的艱難創造、即是將來無窮福利的始基、况且訓政時期只有數年、我們不能毫無準備的使人民踏進一個憲政的空園、至於入民在訓政期間、也絶不是不能盡力國事的、但是在國難當中、而作這一種還政國民的説法、直是想使無組織的人民去擔當非常危難的事變、不但是毁黨、簡直是毁壞國家人民、</p>
<p>更有些人以爲在國難之中、應當毫無抉擇的拉攏各方、甚至於革命的對象、也可以隨便拉攏以爲這様開放門戶、纔能有救於國家、而不想到凡過去得罪國家得罪人民而爲革命障碍的人、隨時隨地都想憑藉一個機會、以圖再起、如果我們不察、恰　其術中、而國難依然還是國難、總括以上穩種、我們很明顯的、是看見有人想趁國難這個題目、做他們所謂「毁黨救國」的工夫、但是我們要曉得中華民國和中國國民黨是同一個生命的、有本黨的存在、然後有中華民國的存在、要毁黨即是毁中華民國、更萬萬没有毁黨而還能救國的、</p>
<p>至關於本黨内部團結的事情、凡屬同志、總要首先顧到整個黨的本身和整個革命的利益、我們對國家對人民負有鉅大的責任、尤其在國難中、我們稍一不愼、便使黨的殘破成爲國家人民的毁滅、黨内同志務要立刻切實團結起來、再不要留下過去的創痕、都要補贖以往的缺失、並要由此發生新的力量、然後這次的團結纔是眞正的精誠團結、纔能共同挽救國家的危難、近來還有把黨政軍三者拿來相提並論、在他們看起來、好像這三様是銖　悉稱的、這未免太不認識黨的組織系統了、他們且從而巧爲分配、又恰在大家共謀團結的時候、最容易使這種無意義的分配謬説、把同志間精誠團結以赴國難的意義都泯滅了、希望大家注意纔好、</p>
<p>以上都是就黨的本身而言、現在説到黨員方面、首先要問問怎様纔是黨員、固然我們平常總認黨部有登記者是黨員、現在我却以爲凡是信仰本黨主義接受政權行使之訓練的、也就是本黨精神上的黨員、因此之故、凡是對三民主義願貢獻自己的心力和生命的、都是黨員、在國難之中、黨員的工作、是隨時隨地都可表現的、不一定要在前方纔是作戰、纔是特别有效的工作、所以黨員受了黨的命令時、應該絶對遵守、絶對執行、而且在任務上總要深入、並要使自身的努力能策動一個地方能策動一個事件、精神上尤其要有長期的持續、然後纔能從實際奮鬥中擴大黨的生命與力量、國家當有事之時、黨員更應當步步爲營作防制敵人的工作、一言之微、一事之細、都不要忽略了、都不要放鬆了、務要做到黨員所在之處、即是任何敵人無計可施之處、這様即無異全國佈滿了我們的防禦工事、國家的危險時期、庶可以迅速度過去、必須是這様、黨員纔能眞正成爲黨的戰士、黨的中央機關也纔能格外有力、因爲對黨内無一切的顧慮對外乃有極精密的規劃、與極正確的指授機宜、同時我們廣大的精神上的黨員乃能得著極有效的領導、而救國禦侮的工作、纔能有了核心、</p>
<p>最後我再説明、一個革命的政黨、在開創國家的時候、必不可免的、是舊勢力的企圖復活、和新制席下人民思想的動搖、以及外來的暴力侵襲、但這一切都早在革命的政黨預料之中、即如本黨爲求中國之自由平等、必須打倒帝國主義、日本帝國主義的必來侵襲、豈有不知之理、但是終必以革命的努力、達到我們國家的自由平等、我記得本黨最初提出打倒帝國主義這個口號時、有人顧慮本黨的力量、恐怕不能做到、總理當時便説「不打倒帝國主義即不必要本黨」、證於今日、日本的暴力侵襲、更使我們非常儆惕、因此要堅决而勇敢的自信、以負荷此使使、目前挽救國難的工作、與此後達到國家平等自由與滿足人民要求的工作、我們絶對相信、是必在本黨領導之下而成功的」、</p>

<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>親愛的國人。我們見了暴日自己不知悔禍。反向我　　國提出警告。不是且駭且怪。而爲之憤憤不平麽。但是。我們請不要駭。請不要怪。請不要憤憤不平。我們還得從心底裏感激暴日。又給我們一個重大的剌激。使我們對日經濟絶交與抵制日貨的决心。更能堅定而持久。我們做一天人。就得抵制一天日貨。堅决的抵制下去。以至於十年百年無景數年之久。而在這三年五年之間。我們就可眼瞧着暴日喫不了。兜着起咧。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>史督師對國民訓話</h3>
<p>史督師可法雖是死了二百八十六年，但是他的精神没有死。他　　還在我們當中活着，永遠的活着。請聽一聽他的訓話吧！二百八十七年前，李自成陷北京，崇禎帝自縊，清兵入關破李自成，據明朝江山而有之。南方將領議立福王，史公被馬士英等所忌，自請爲督師出鎭信陽。他祭二陵畢上疏對福王説：</p>
<p>「若晏處東南，不思遠略，賢奸無辨，威斷不靈，老成投簪，豪傑裏足，祖宗怨恫，天命潛移，東南一隅，未可保也。」</p>
<p>當時南方諸臣不自覺悟，將亡國之罪盡推在北方諸臣身上，而史公獨説公平話：</p>
<p>「北都之變凡屬臣子皆有罪。在北者應從死，豈顺南者非人臣？」</p>
<p>十一月清兵入宿遷，還攻邳州，他又上疏説：</p>
<p>「夫將所以能克敵者氣也：君所以能御將者志也，廟堂志不奮，則行問氣不鼓。」</p>
<p>在同疏裏他又説：</p>
<p>「在北諸臣死節者無多，在南諸臣討賊者復：此千三之恥也。」</p>
<p>我們現在看了這番話，該作何感想？現在是民主國。以國民君。以公僕代臣，則史公所説的話還有那一句不切中時弊呢？</p>
<p>公元一六四五年四月十五清兵進攻揚州，史公孤軍血戰十日，多鐸五次致書勸降，都不啓封，城破自殺未遂，被清兵執去，多鐸相待如賓，口呼先生説：「今忠義旣成，先生爲我收拾江南，當不惜重任也。」史公怒説：「頭可斷，身不可屈！」</p>
<p>這是史督師自已實踐的最後一句話，也就是他對中華民族億萬年不朽之遺囑。我們可忘記没有？</p>
<p>明史稱史公「短小精幹，面黑目爍爍有光，廉，信，與下均勞苦。軍行士不飽不先食，未授衣不先御，以故得土死力。」我們看了這段話便知道史公之忠義報國，不是偶然的了。</p>
<p>明朝之亡原因很多，主要的是主庸臣貪史可法太少，而魏忠賢吳三桂輩太多，魏忠賢吳三桂輩起得太早而史可法起得太遲。中華民國之史可法有幾位？還要等到什麽時候纔出來呀？</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>威爾士新流行的蝸</p>
<p>牛賽跑西方人</p>
<p>之對於游戲。往往異想天開。弄出許多新花様來。最近英倫西部的威爾士。便有人新發起一種蝸牛的賽跑。一時很爲流行。蝸牛向來是出名跑不快的。而如今徧要它們賽跑。所以那旁觀者趣味的濃厚。據説與看跑馬跑狗不相上下。並且也有同様的刺激力。蝸牛們經一度賽跑之後。當然分出勝負來所以他們也可下注賭博。在金錢上着想。其趣味自然與跑馬跑狗相同了。</p>
<p>英京倫敦方面據説也有一種異想天開的比賽。與威爾士的蝸牛賽跑大同小異。他們是用烏　來賽跑。有幾位打算在交際塲中出頭的漂亮少年。主持其事。近來曾在幾個娱樂的集會中舉行過幾次。倒也很引起參觀者的興味。不過烏　要出錢去買。不比蝸牛可隨意在路旁或墻壁上覓取。所以流行之廣。還不如威爾士的蝸牛賽跑哩。</p>
<p>童子軍兩行。全身武裝。狀甚雄壯。二門口中懸「收回領土」四字横額。旁有聯曰。「一德一心。共謀救國」「不屈不撓。團結向前」。會塲設於議事廳。門口設簽到處。各人簽名後。給以紅心徽章一枚。中嵌「决」字。表示决心抗日救國之意。反面印有婦女救國大同盟團結奮鬥民國二十年十月一日等字。各人臂纒黑紗。胸佩紅章。令人觸目驚心。會塲四壁。遍貼「要得最後勝利。祇有經濟絶交。」」我們有三年的决心。就可以制矮奴的死命」。「抵制日貨。是我們婦女的責任」。「能守今天大會的誓約。方有救國希望」。等標語劉王立明致開會詞時。謂我國婦女界向不預聞國是。今日此舉。係破天荒使各國聞之。始悉東方之睡獅醒。東亞之病夫已健。秉良心主張而主持公理。是日該會預定除報界外。不准男人入内。嗣因社會局所派之代表係男性。故特别通融而又招待遼寗青年會總幹事閻寳航。與上海抗日救國會宣傳委員吳邁二。人閻君於九月廿二日離遼寗。親見日兵暴行。故報告十八晚至二十一日止所見慘狀甚詳盡。最後并謂日以兵力佔據。我人須以兵力奪還。徒靠交涉是無用的。東北方面同胞。此次備受凌虐。故已有决心。此案以後了結時。無論何人簽訂喪權辱國之條約。即起而割除其簽字之手。以示與衆共棄。衆皆鼓掌。吳君謂我國抵制日貨已有多次。結果均虎頭蛇尾。致有今日之事。頃見貴會紅心徽章。甚爲興奮望將此章保存。以章上所印之字深印腦際。永矢勿諼。提案中除次日本報所載外。有人以婦女外出購貨。無辨别貨之能力。主請各商店將國貨標明外。并於仿單上刋「如是日貨包退還洋」八字。則誤購後可以掉換。討論章程時。劉王立明聲明泯滅强權四字之用章。推舉執行委員及各部職員時。由一人提出。二人附議而付表决。數千隻玉臂高</p>
<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>黠僕</p>
<p>燕京雜記極言京中奴僕之奸黠。曲盡情態。</p>
<p>凡有興作及置物等類。多由司　之手。司　先定賄於市人使昂其價值。然後引之進門。倘主人斥去令改招别處。雖易數家。其價遞倍。主人無奈卒依初價。京師賣物荷担或市肆。遇貴人必昻其價值。僕隸則常價得之矣。余嘗偶立門。有荷蟹過者。問其價昂甚。後還内喚僕買之。則前價一半耳。余思其故不得。後問久旅者。咸謂與貴人交易時少。與僕役交易時多。倘以常價賣於貴人。便破僕役浮開之數。於是羣僕交詈。遞相遍告。無復與交易者。以故與貴人交必昂其價值云。</p>
<p>僕隸浮物價。彼此通合。彌縫上欺。即南僕初入京者。亦於市上互相盟約。私定濫報之數。百喙一詞。使主人無從考察。中有醇厚者。不入其黨。拳棒交下。凡久居京者皆知此情。然以京僕恭謹知禮法。伺應善如人意。亦習而安之。寗願少受欺綸。終勝於親與市廛較錙銖也。近年階級之限已除。南人旅居。多習於市易。則豪奴之技亦漸無所施矣。中等人家多不用男僕。其弊尤尠。然女僕之奸黠亦正未易周防。凡介紹女僕者。俗號媒行。業媒行者。必爲熟於世情之婦女。藏垢納汚。不言可喻。若人家須喚女僕。輒相其門地高下。主人性格習尙。爲擇其宜者應之。其人初至。必甘方柔色以媚主人三日内謂之試工不合則去然多不待試工期滿。輒復求去。蓋利其按日討貲。而媒行生送一人輒得車費一次也。若安而不去。則須先取一月工資。而以四分之一獻媒行。每届三節。仍有常例。媒行旣利於女僕之屢易其主。女僕亦從無安於一枝之意。常日米煤瑣屑。隨手盜竊。轉售店中。便獲蠅頭。姿首稍佳。或與厮役勾結。致成姦盜。皆習聞之事也。往時工資至薄。近方以月三元爲準。然若輩所冀者。在主人飮博贈遺。可得額外之收入。縱增其工資。亦不足邀其一盼也。故寡交游之家。尤難於用人。要之惡習不易革除矣。</p>
<p>舉如林。煞是好看。宣誓時。聲音清脆中。帶有激昻慷慨之意。滿腔熱血。可以概見。二萬萬女同胞均能起而抗日救國。日雖强。不足爲患。語曰衆志成城。請一致團結而弗餒。</p>
<h3>瀋陽歸來驚定追記</h3>
<p>— 吳偉女士</p>
<p>嘗讀少陵詩云。至今猶破膽。應有未　　招魂。余自瀋陽歸來。驚定思驚。歸夢搖搖。若猶有未招之魂然者。余因世界潮流。無論性别。皆宜求學。夙承庭訓。入校有年。差幸略識之無。益思竿頭日進。對於法政理化尤爲心之所好。非必有所奢望。以爲人能解此二者。則立身不入歧途。格物致知。尤可使科學發明。應世界之用。不致利權外溢。今秋考入瀋陽馮庸大學。於九月十三晨由滬乘長春丸北上。十四抵青島。十五達大連。十六由南滿鐵路赴瀋陽。入馮庸大學。已昏暮矣。乃料量入校手續。即住校舍。時校中已開學。余即隨班上課。二日疊赴電局發家報。而電不通。往銀行取所匯之欵。而不得領。心甚異之。知時局有變。因思過大連時。孫老伯等均勸阻北上。其言豈有所聞耶。余以一弱女子。數千里迢遙就學。甫卸行裝。猝遇時變。家無聞知。羣情惶惶。躊躇不安者久之。乃决討辭校南旋。十八日下午八時束裝登車。行三小時。忽聞砲聲隆隆震天。未幾又傳鐵路已斷。驚人動魄。同車者皆慄慄危懼。直至二十一日由大連乘舟南歸。廿三日下午四時抵滬。與二親及弟妹等相見欣慰。嗣知校長馮先生被日兵拘去。同學均散有不得歸者。悽苦萬狀。險哉。假令余稍遲疑。在勢亦將罹禍。蓋余所乘之車。乃最後之通車。此後即無車矣。回思此行如在夢中。能不驚定思驚耶。（移酬助賑）</p>
<p>本刊啟事昨日刋載鄭君平君所撰「遼寗七日記」文内第三十五行中。有「······日方有三十條限我方二十四小時内答復。我方置之不理······」云云。頃據另一在瀋從政避難歸來之某君言。並無其事。深恐各方誤會特此鄭重聲明。</p>

<h3>敲夢的杵（七）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>裴時受了先生的訓斥，並不改變他的刀錐工作；依舊在製造上　　面，下那深切的研究。他積日累月工作的成績，端的可以打破藝術史上的紀錄，他製成的木狗，放在門側，有一種蹲坐的姿勢，可以亂眞；有人推戶入内，碰動機關，木狗便能起而狂吠；吠的聲音也可以亂眞。其他，製造的奇器，層出不窮，都是有益於實用。可惜裴時的老子，是崇拜八股的人他以爲，八股便是唯一的藝術；對於裴時的造作機械東西，有一種深惡痛絶的表示丨三令五申的把兒子痛斥，又在他座右貼着一條「不作無益害有益」的標語，</p>
<p>裴老頭兒錯了！他指定無益的是機械工作，有益的是八股文章，他祗在科舉題名錄裏面翻筋斗，才發出這般的謬解。但是，當時的輿論，不論老的，少的，智的，愚的，大都表同情於裴老頭兒而不表同情於裴小頭兒，以爲裴時眞呆漢，眞笨伯，眞壽頭，不該放却可以耀祖榮宗的八股文章不幹，而去幹那奇技淫巧的機械工作。旁的人這般品評裴遲，是不足怪的；最奇怪的，生有二十世紀頭腦而坐在十八世緪轉輪椅上的陶遲，也跟着這許多老的，少的，智的，愚的，而去責備他的同窗學友裴時。</p>
<p>裴時怎様呢？他確是守着不作無益害有益的信條但是，他的眼光和裴老頭兒不同；他指定八股文章是無益的，機械工作是有益的如潮如沸的輿論，不能搖動他的智識大本營，他祇是從事他的一種理想的丨一輛小車會得在兩條鐵絲上自由往來的方法。</p>

<p>南頭昨日米情各帮來貨三十號左右、各貨交易呆滯、因天氣轉晴、各店號買者略少、新粳各低四五角、新洋杜尖及早晚稻胃口寥寥、跟落角許、惟厚粳貨少、價無上落、變陰元茶食店銷場略有、價無升沉、楓涇新百哥稻上市米品極好、價開十四元二角、</p>
<p>新閘昨日各路來源尙湧、早晨臨市人數極少、人心看軟、新粳早稻價低一尺薄稻厚粳到積不多、客帮全無成交、本街夫化不多、價鬆一角新蘆洋尖到銷二敵、價無漲跌、昨日午後三時調查、共計米船三百號、每船均約一百石、</p>
<p>總計存米額在三萬擔左右、</p>
<h3>現小絞有北帮問訊</h3>

<p>昨日麫粉市况、現貨仍無大帮問訊、惟津帮因該地近日走消甚佳、乃將定貨一部份裝運赴津、惟新交易則無問訉、期貨市况、更見不佳、因洋麥到埠與價跌已足影響、更以時局不佳、人心搖動、而銀根又緊、現化停頓、開市後近遠各月份一致下跌、午後更疲、二三月份均跌進二兩關内、收市雖略見定勢、但仍無佳况也、收市價計十月小二分半、十一·十二月各小三分二五、一月份小三分半、二月份小三分、三月份小二分半云、</p>
<h3>麥市一致狂瀉</h3>
<p>昨日小麥市况、上午開市後各月份一致狂跌小去三五分不等、因洋麥續小四五角、美國賑災賒麥已到第一批三萬噸、故人心甚軟、賣氣益旺、下午多頭翻買爲空、市面更見不支、收市價十一月二月三月各小八分、十月一月各小七分、十二月份小五分、現麥久無廠胃、昨日廠方應酬高郵麥百餘包、價三兩二錢半、比上月初小去三四錢去、</p>
<p>糖市　太古糖步開步漲</p>
<p>劃盤交靜市堅</p>

<p>疋頭　麥爾登及馬褲呢市俱跌　　麥爾登專製西裝之需料、故大半俱爲洋服裁縫帮之去路、尙有大批軍服號衣等、亦多選取斯料、故邇來麥爾登銷胃不弱、今庚到貨甚多、售價步跌、昨寗豐大石江麥爾登每碼减售二兩一錢、順全隆鏡花緣一兩七錢七分半、華波聯歡圖二兩二錢、天祥頭號二兩二錢半、次號一兩八錢、較之上月份俱跌一錢左右、</p>
<p>馬褲呢乃前歲所新盛行之毛貨也、爲上春時薄大衣之獨一需料、其走銷亦廣、本　需銷占十之六七、上半年春季每碼售元八兩二錢半、趨勢尙極俏活、市氣見萎、最高等之貨、每碼祗售七兩五錢、較之上半年、每碼已跌去一元、其跌屬亦可謂不輕矣、考其原因、良由上半年市氣太佳、定者激增、造成目下到貨充斤、供過於售耳、</p>
<p>煤炭　國煤銷路頗暢</p>
<p>國煤博山統、自抗日抵貨以來、本埠銷路大暢、每日輒有五六百噸成交、日昨又到新貨三千餘噸、售價每噸十一兩二錢半、又北票煤屑、近日　路無錫蘇州等處、裝去頗多、昨日又有三百四十餘噸卸去、售價每噸十兩云、</p>

<h3>復仇</h3>
<p>— 彥文</p>
<p>早晨到學校裏來母親囑付我們早點回家、因爲父親這兩天之内就要動身出門了、母親預備燒點東西送父親的行、就把八月半提早做了、母親還告訴我、特地爲我殺了一隻雞子、那隻養了半年的花毛的雞子、······我呢我只記掛着怎様度過了這個上午、只要度過了這個上午、我就可以回家吃那隻紅燒的雞子了、可是這個上午怎様度得過去呢、莫先生老早就告訴過我們、今天要考算術、第一點鐘就是算術、而我到現在、連雙位的乘法都不會做、怎様辦、心裏想、逃吧、然而這不能玩的、如果被母親知道了、好一定要像從前那様責罰我、</p>

(6th China News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Matters Concerning the Taking Over of Eastern Provinces</p>
<h3>Unable to Actively Proceed</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Several reporters visited Deputy Zhang today. Zhang sent Qin Hua as his representative, who stated that regarding the Japanese troop withdrawal, only the Japanese troops in Fenghuangcheng had withdrawn to the vicinity of the railway. Other important areas have not shown any signs of withdrawal. The Central Government ordered Deputy Zhang to send Wang Shuchang and Zhang Zuoxiang to take over, but because the Japanese troops have not withdrawn, they are unable to actively proceed. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Side Supplies Arms and Ammunition, They Retreat as Zhang's Troops Approach</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the morning of the 5th, 2,000 Inner Mongolian troops, supplied with arms and ammunition by the Japanese side, occupied Taonan. There are still 5,000 Mongolian troops gathering in various banners of Inner Mongolia awaiting dispatch. Princes and dukes of various banners in Inner Mongolia, such as Gorlos, have declared independence. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) It is rumored that Guo Daofu, instigated by the Japanese, is secretly planning independence in Hulunbuir. Guo has now issued a telegram denying this. (5th) (Harbin) The Inner Mongolian troops occupying Taonan withdrew on the evening of the 5th, reportedly due to Zhang Hailu's troops in Taonan concentrating towards Hinggan. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 5th, 2,000 Mongolian cavalry arrived in Taonan, left without causing damage. The arms and ammunition were supplied by the Japanese. (6th Dispatch) (Beiping) Prince Gong has entered Hulunbuir. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese in the Sino-Japanese joint-venture Zami Logging Company in the Hinggan Mountains are storing hundreds of guns and are planning action. (6th) (Beiping) The Japanese are again instigating Mongolian people in the Inner Mongolia area to become independent. Prince D尔罕 has been invited to reside at the Japanese station in Liaoning, and his residence is guarded by Japanese soldiers. The 包統領 of the Prince's banner has recently returned to Liaoyuan. The Japanese presented him with over 500 saddles and all expenses are covered by the Japanese. After the matter is completed, the railway and police power in the Taoliao area will be given to the Japanese as compensation. The 包統領 is actively working with Prince 温都 and Mongolians such as Han Ruiting. More than 40 young Mongolian students who have recently returned from Liaoning are engaged in propaganda. This atmosphere permeates the Taoliao area. Japanese people follow the Mongolian princes, strutting through the streets, full of vigor. It is said that Japan has decided to be responsible for supplying all military supplies to the princes and dukes of the 48 banners of Inner Mongolia, and there is a rumor that they have signed a secret agreement with the Japanese. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rampant Banditry in Shenyang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Self-Defense Police Bureau organized by Feng Jingyi, a Japanese lackey, forces the police to stand guard unarmed, unable to resist bandits. As a result, Wang Dashan, Hu Chenglu, Zhu Baofu, and other division chiefs of the 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th Precincts, unwilling to be used by the Japanese, have successively resigned and left Shenyang and have joined the Jinxian Provincial Government. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese military police, who forcibly occupied the Shenyang Telecommunications Administration, collude with unscrupulous Chinese and Japanese to search for military equipment under the pretext of searching for military equipment, arbitrarily looting the residences of important people and wealthy shops. If the Chinese police are slow to comply, they are immediately arrested. Residents are increasingly panicked, and the Japanese will inevitably displace hundreds of households. (6th Dispatch) (Beiping) After Chairman Zang of Shenyang was taken away by the Japanese army, he was first detained at the Finance Department, then moved to Bao Wen樾's residence in the commercial district, and recently moved back to Zang's private residence, but is still under surveillance. (6th Dispatch) Yuan Jinkai etc.</p>
<h3>Denial of Plans for Independence</h3>
<p>Is their statement credible?</p>
<p>(Shenyang) At 5 PM yesterday, Yuan Jinkai and other members of the Local Maintenance Committee issued a joint declaration to all parties, stating that the organization of the committee is solely for maintaining local security and has no plans to establish an independent government. The contents of the declaration are as follows:</p>
<p>Since the incident on the evening of September 18, all government offices and shops in Fengtian have been completely shut down, and people are extremely uneasy. In order to maintain local security, we have organized the Local Maintenance Committee, established a self-defense police force, resisted bandits, restored finance, and protected residents. There are no other facilities or actions, nor is there any intention to organize a government or issue a declaration of independence. This committee is entirely for the purpose of protecting merchants and maintaining local security and is a temporary agency. It will be dissolved immediately after the incident is resolved and the responsible authorities are determined. (6th Teletouch Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Minister Rong Kui announced today a telegram from the Nanjing government accusing Japan of using the Manchurian Security Maintenance Committee to incite the separation of Manchuria, and stated that the National Government does not recognize the Security Maintenance Committee.

<h3>Northeast Dignitaries Meeting</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Deputy Zhang convened a meeting of Northeast dignitaries at Prince Shuncheng's residence at 6 PM tonight to discuss the issue with Japan. Security was tight. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Regarding the Anti-Japanese Movement</p>
<h3>Japanese Note to Us</h3>
<p>Has not yet been delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, it was rumored that the Japanese government had sent us a serious note. Officials said they had not received it. The British side said that it was delivered by Tokyo to the Chinese chargé d'affaires in Japan on the 6th, but as of 10 PM on the 6th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs still said they had not received this document. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As of 7 PM tonight, the Japanese government's protest regarding China's anti-Japanese movement has not yet been delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan has protested to Nanjing about China's anti-Japanese movement and is now planning to send marines to Shanghai for protection. It is reported that in the protest note delivered to China, Japan did not accuse Nanjing of actually inciting the anti-Japanese movement, but rather accused the National Government of neglecting to take measures to stop anti-Japanese actions and other actions that endanger lives and property. In effect, the protest is accusing Nanjing of negligence, not intentional wrongdoing, but stating that Japan views negligence as seriously as intentional wrongdoing. The authorities are now preparing to send a cruiser with marines to Shanghai because the Japanese forces currently in Shanghai are fewer than those of other countries. According to reliable sources, Zhang Xueliang in Beiping inquired with the Japanese Embassy about whether Japan was prepared to negotiate with him in order to resolve the Manchurian Incident. The Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to comment on this news, but acknowledged that even if this statement were true, there would be a pessimistic view of the possibility of success. It is also reported that the Japanese Cabinet decided to disregard Commander Honjo's declaration in Shenyang that the Japanese military in Shenyang, in view of Zhang Xueliang's insincere attitude towards Japan, had decided to gradually sever all relations with Zhang Xueliang. It is said that the Cabinet was very disapproving of Honjo's actions because they interfered with matters that non-military authorities had the right to oversee. The National Merchants' Congress is scheduled to be held in Tokyo on October 9 to discuss China's anti-Japanese actions. At that time, the resolutions passed by the Congress will be sent to the government. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>All Concentrated in Shanghai and Hankou</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At today's regular cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Wakatsuki, Foreign Minister Shidehara, and Navy Minister Abo reported on the worsening anti-Japanese situation in southern China. Cabinet members then exchanged views and decided that the current anti-Japanese and anti-Japanese goods movement in various parts of southern China clearly violates the commercial treaty, and the lives and property of residents are difficult to ensure safety. In addition to lodging the strongest protest with the Chinese government, the Japanese government will simultaneously dispatch warships and marines to China, and all Japanese residents in China will be concentrated in Shanghai and Hankou for protection. (6th Teletouch Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Protesting Japanese Army Brutality</h3>

(5th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Reuters learned today that the Chinese and Japanese delegations to the League of Nations are successively forwarding to the League of Nations Secretariat copies of telegrams received from their respective governments regarding the current situation in Manchuria. According to telegrams from Nanjing on October 1 and 3, Japanese troops are still occupying Shenyang, Jilin, Zhengjiatun, and Xinmintun, so the Chinese authorities are still unable to handle administrative affairs in these places. Shops in Shenyang have suffered damage due to the Japanese soldiers' disturbances and are still closed and unable to open for business. The Japanese side's telegram, issued on September 29, stated that the area of Shenyang not under Japanese military control is rife with bandits, and many shops have been closed. It also stated that Japanese soldiers prevented rioters from destroying a university and a certain school, that banditry is rampant, and that the Kuomintang is currently conducting a vigorous anti-Japanese propaganda campaign. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Eden, the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in London, stated in the House of Commons today that the British government's attitude towards the Manchurian incident is fully in line with that of the League of Nations Administrative Council. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

(6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russian News Agency's Comments</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Russian official TASS news agency described the rumors circulating abroad that Russian cavalry and armored vehicles had entered Manchuria as provocative rumors. It also stated that the claim that the Red Army had crossed or would cross the Manchurian border was completely untrue. All Russian newspapers today carried editorials on the long conversation between Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, all of which stated that as far as Manchuria is concerned, a real war is still in the future, and the current actions are only preliminary. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Meeting at Kong Xiangxi's Residence</p>
<h3>Discussing Diplomacy with Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) There was a meeting at Kong Xiangxi's residence in Sanyuan Alley on the evening of the 6th.

Now, due to various inconveniences under the current violence, they have returned to China to organize separately. It has now been established, with Dai Jitao elected as honorary president and Chen Daqi as president, and nine directors have been elected. They will make recommendations regarding the Eastern Provinces Incident. (6th)</p>
<h3>Perspectives on Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Over the past three days, people from European and American countries visiting Beijing have made the following criticisms and views on Japan's atrocities: (1) China does not deny Japan's economic rights in Liaoning and Jilin. For example, China has not declared its non-recognition of jointly operated railways. Japan's sudden occupation of Liaoning Province and Jilin Taonan and other places with military force is a violation of Japan's economic scope. Any joint venture is commercial in nature and cannot be occupied by troops. There is no reason for the advance of troops in Taonan and Jilin. Because the Jidun and Sitao loan contracts are commercial. Who in the world brings two armed guards after becoming a merchant, if a merchant brings armed guards, who dares to approach him? (2) Japan in the League of Nations, solemnly promised to withdraw within the South Manchuria Railway area 14 years ago, which seems credible. Since Japan is a great power, it naturally cannot lie in the League of Nations. However, I am afraid that plainclothes police and patrol police and soldiers cannot be completely withdrawn 14 years ago, so this item can be shirked by the Japanese side as not being the army. (3) The anti-Japanese movement in the inland provinces is a righteous indignation caused by Japan's atrocities in Liaoning and Jilin, and has no direct impact on the main issue in Liaoning and Jilin. Japan should not delay the withdrawal of troops by holding anti-Japanese actions hostage. (4) Shanghai Japanese businessmen exaggerate the issue of Chinese workers being dismissed from their jobs by Japanese companies, claiming that a great disaster is coming, and even urgently telegraphed Shidehara, requesting the dispatch of a large number of troops to the Yangtze River. This is a great loss of a businessman's identity. Those who do business in other countries always avoid using soldiers as bodyguards as reasonable. Ten years ago, when China boycotted American goods, American merchants never asked the United States to send troops. Although the Japanese government has dispatched warships this time, it is feared that it will still not be able to ease the boycott of goods, because there is absolutely no one in the world who uses guns to force people to trade with them. (6th)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Northeast Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) There are more than 400 outstanding Sino-Japanese Northeast cases, of which more than 150 are greatly related to the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Liaoning and Jilin. For example, Japan's request to break China's self-operated Ji Hai and other four railway lines and to cancel the Huludao port construction plan exceeds the rights obtained by Japan in the treaty. Therefore, the Northeast Communications Committee has never dared to negotiate on these cases, resulting in Japan's hardline action this time. Among them, there are still 150 cases, which are very small problems in various localities of the three provinces, such as criminal cases involving Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese people. Such cases can be settled by mutual offset in the future. Japan did not insist on this in the past. There are still dozens of cases that our side requires the Japanese side to handle, such as the Wanbaoshan and Korean cases, which are particularly prominent. Japan should bear major responsibility. Today, the League of Nations has made great concessions to Japan, abandoning the original plan to send an international committee to investigate together and only ordering Japan to withdraw its troops to their original locations. In the future, China and Japan will negotiate as the parties concerned. In the future, China and Japan cannot never negotiate forever. Even if they negotiate, they cannot be called direct negotiations, because future negotiations between China and Japan will be like the League of Nations issuing a request for the plaintiff and defendant to mediate on their own. Therefore, the League of Nations' responsibility for arbitration has not been shrugged off. The people of the country cannot attack the negotiations in the name of direct negotiations. This is the correct interpretation of international law. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Karakhan</p>
<h3>Expresses Goodwill to Mo</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Moscow telegram: Karakhan expressed goodwill to Mo Dehui, saying that Russia will never send troops to China. Even if it increases troops to the Far East, it is for self-defense, and there is no intention to collude with Japan to plot against China. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northern Financial Situation</h3>
<p>Can manage for two or three months</p>
<p>(Beiping) The northern financial community is very stable. The source of funds is mainly from domestic expenditures, which can be managed. There is no problem within two or three months. If we manage outside the pass, it will be insufficient. The political situation may not change temporarily either. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's Tough Policy Toward China and the Anti-Japanese Movement</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army violated international law and launched an undeclared war against us, violently occupying our Northeast, the relations between China and Japan and the feelings of the people have fallen into a very pessimistic state of extreme deterioration. This is an undeniable fact. Our entire country is devoting all its efforts to relieving the unprecedented flood disaster, but Japan takes advantage of our danger. Within one day, it placed half of our Northeast under violent coercion, plundering property and slaughtering the people, treating us as enemies. This is an international event of the utmost importance and intolerability. Our country's officials, troubled by the flood and bound by the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, and there is no resistance. Our people, angered by the ever-increasing acts of violence and frightened by the imminent threat of annihilation, have spontaneously risen up for the sake of national salvation and self-preservation, with a planned and disciplined, well-organized step, and with a tragic attitude of non-violent resistance, to economically uncooperate with Japan, in order to arouse the awareness of the Japanese government and the public and change its policy of aggression against China. This is the action that a nation with blood and integrity should take. Moreover, it is the necessary means of resisting violence and defending oneself, and there is absolutely no room for interference based on public reason and justice. However, the resolution of the Japanese cabinet meeting on the 5th, regarding our country's current anti-Japanese movement, actually put forward so-called serious warnings, unreasonable defenses, and unbridled intimidation. This kind of protest is sufficient to prove that the Japanese are devils who trample on public reason, and is sufficient to encourage our people to be even more determined in their struggle.</p>
<p>Why do the Chinese people "resort to boycotts at every turn" over the years? Why has the recent "particularly hostile and retaliatory anti-Japanese movement" been triggered? Anyone should be able to clearly see that it is a reaction to the Japanese people's years of aggression against China and the recent violent occupation of our Northeast. Why can't the Japanese people recognize this extremely obvious cause-and-effect relationship? Why don't they reflect on the fact that they are wielding a knife to cut people's throats and want people to be silent, not resist, and even endure death to show friendship? How can that be possible? The Japanese should think for themselves.</p>
<p>Try to examine the past history. Every time an anti-Japanese movement has occurred in our country, has it not been a reaction to Japanese oppression? The Japanese sing about friendship and peace for decades, but their aggression against us has also lasted for decades. The Nanjing Incident in 1913, the occupation of our Qingdao and Jiaoji Railway in 1914, the Twenty-One Demands in 1915, the interference in our country's participation in World War I in 1917, the Changchun Incident in 1919, the Hunchun Massacre in 1920, the massacre of overseas Chinese during the earthquake in 1923, the bombardment of our Dagu Fort in 1926, the Jinan Incident in 1928, the Wanbaoshan Incident and the Korean Incident this year, and the recent violent seizure of our Northeast. Old wounds have not healed, and new pains have been added. Bloodstains are piled up, all over the body. Recounting the past, what the Japanese have inflicted on us, is it friendship or aggression? Tanaka Giichi's memorial is clearly a conspiracy. The recent speech by the Wakatsuki Cabinet has ulterior motives. The recent instructions to soldiers by the Army Minister Minami is an even more blatant expression of hostility towards our country. The Manchuria Reader consistently refuses to recognize the Northeast as our territory, and other textbooks encourage students to invade our country. Are all these facts friendship or aggression? Furthermore, the Japanese warships are densely deployed in our Yangtze River, and those that follow are still coming in an endless stream. The excuse the Japanese use is to protect overseas Chinese, but the overseas Chinese in various places are absolutely safe and there is nothing to worry about. Where does their true intention lie, is it friendship or aggression? The Japanese are inflicting such things on us, and they want us, after offering no resistance, to willingly endure the trampling of iron hooves and express our gratitude. I dare to tell the Japanese that the people of a civilized ancient country with more than 5,000 years of history, even if the country is weak, will never accept the absurd and outrageous demands of the Japanese. Even if we are exhausted, we will never let go of our last weapon.</p>
<p>When the American black ships broke through Japan's door, the great powers came one after another demanding trade and commerce and signing unequal treaties. The Japanese people also rose up in riots to resist, burning down foreign consulates and killing foreign expatriates. Our current anti-Japanese movement is still limited to non-cooperation and to encouraging the people to love their motherland and protect their nation. The attitude is peaceful and the behavior is upright and aboveboard. What does it have to do with the Japanese people's criticism and intervention? What is being inflicted on us is so great, and what is being asked of us is so different. This is truly what the Western philosopher Jesus said: "You only see the splinter in your brother's eye, but do not see the beam in your own eye." If the Japanese can remove the beam from their own eyes, we will remove the splinter from our eyes, and it will not be a problem at all. Friendship must be expressed in facts. The Chinese people have suffered deeply for decades and hate extremely. We will never forget what we have suffered. Yet the Japanese still say that "Japan has always striven to promote friendship between China and Japan," deceiving themselves and others. Do they think that the Chinese people are all three-foot-tall children? Do they think that the eyes and ears of the world can be covered with one hand?</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>British Cabinet Completes</p>
<h3>Dissolution of Parliament Procedures</h3>
<p>British Emperor Approves Financial Bill</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - The government's financial bill was approved by the British Emperor last night, and the government's balanced budget process is complete. All reduction plans are now being actively implemented according to the special procedures stipulated in the National Reduction Act. Now that the necessary bills to deal with the national financial panic have been passed, the second step is to hold elections to seek the people's consent to extend the reduction policy. Reuters learned last night that after repeated negotiations, Liberal Party leaders Samuel and Liding had agreed with other cabinet members on a common approach that most Liberal Party members of Parliament could support. The cabinet adjourned late at night and unanimously agreed to request the British Emperor to dissolve Parliament immediately in order to hold general elections based on the declaration to be issued by the Prime Minister. It is heard that the declaration requires the people to give the Prime Minister a free hand so that he can adopt any methods necessary to stabilize the country's finances (including tax rates). Official documents must wait until the Prime Minister meets with the British Emperor before they can be released, and they will be announced in the House of Commons approximately tomorrow. As for the content of the private conversation between MacDonald and Lloyd George, it is not yet known, but since tax rates are not clearly stated in the National Government's platform, the Liberal Party can support the government's election platform. At the same time, the Labour Party is also preparing to fight. The congress yesterday passed resolutions on the public ownership of industries, revised war debts and reparations procedures, and strict disarmament procedures. Now that the cabinet's intentions are consistent, the cabinet does not need to resign due to the elections. Parliament will be dissolved this Thursday, and the election will be held on October 28th.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 6th - Today, British Foreign Secretary Liding went to Paris to visit French Prime Minister Laval and Foreign Minister Briand, as well as Finance Minister Flandin. This is because, in view of Laval's new meeting with German authorities Bruning and Curtiss's return, and he is about to visit US President Hoover, he will make presentations and discussions on the British political situation. Also, Prime Minister MacDonald went to Buckingham Palace to meet the British Emperor at 9:15 this morning and left the palace to return to his residence on Downing Street at 9:50. It is heard that the discussions were about dissolving Parliament, as well as the general election and the convening date of the new Parliament. Currently, the procedures for dissolving Parliament have been completed, and the general election and the convening date of the new Parliament are still awaiting a decision by the British Emperor's Privy Council.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister</p>
<h3>Kurtis Resigns</h3>
<p>Cabinet Will Collapse Because of This</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th - Foreign Minister Kurtis has resigned today because his party is dissatisfied with his attitude towards the German-Austrian Customs Union and does not provide support. Four other cabinet members have also lost their party's support due to the government's strict financial orders. Now that Kurtis has resigned, the entire cabinet will likely collapse because of this. However, President Hindenburg may still entrust Bruning to organize a new government that can be accepted by the majority of Parliament. If the current Bruning government faces the Parliament that will reconvene on October 13, it is feared that it will be defeated in a vote of confidence. Today, the President issued another emergency decree, stipulating that one-third of unemployment benefits may be issued in food instead of cash, and prohibiting the construction of public offices before April 1934. It also authorizes the government to reduce salaries and pensions above 15,000 marks per year. Those who incite political unrest will be severely punished.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 5th - There have been rumors for a long time that Foreign Minister Kurtis will resign, and it is expected to become a reality soon. Prime Minister Bruning has not yet chosen a successor and will likely use this opportunity to consolidate the cabinet's position in order to cope with the Parliament that will reconvene next week. A fierce debate is expected at this meeting. Bruning must deal with it with all his energy, because the National Socialist Party has announced that it intends to return to Parliament in order to overthrow the cabinet. Therefore, it has officially joined hands with the German National Party, and the Social Democratic Party may not support Bruning. The party members are now divided, and their leaders are trying to protect themselves and may join the opposition.</p>
<h3>Issue of Suspending War Debt Payments</h3>
<p>US Government is Considering</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 5th - It is learned that several members of the US government are studying the possibility of extending the suspension of war debt payments, because the suspension period for war debts and reparations under the Hoover Plan expires on July 1st of next year. Currently, the US banking community supports extending the period to three or five years, but many members of Congress oppose the extension. President Hoover, however, stated a few days ago that he has not considered this matter yet.</p>
<p>US Authorities</p>
<h3>Will Have Important Announcements</h3>
<p>Regarding the Global Economic Decline</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 6th - Washington now expects that as a result of the plan set during the secret consultation between a few bankers and President Hoover on Sunday night in Wall Street, there will be an important announcement from the authorities within a few hours regarding the global economic decline. This statement is published in today's New York Times. It is said that the New York Reserve Bank held a meeting yesterday for this matter, and the participants were four of the most powerful financiers in the country, namely Witley of Morgan Company, Vichein, Chairman of the National Bank, Miguel, Chief of the National City Bank, and Pute, President of the Guarantee Trust Company. According to Washington sources, President Hoover convened a meeting of leaders of both the Republican and Democratic parties, the same format as the meeting convened a year ago to announce the suspension of war debts. US Labor Federation</p>
<h3>Considering Economic Panic</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Winkford (USA), 5th - The American Federation of Labor seriously considered the problem of the world economic panic today. President Linger said that if industrial leaders continue to use the strategy of wage cuts and refuse to accept the advice of distributing work and hiring more workers, then the laboring class, driven by hunger and cold, will inevitably take risks and cause a revolution. Today, the number of unemployed in the laboring class is extremely unstable. The failure of the past aristocracy can serve as a warning. The executive committee of the association also reported, criticizing the banking community for using its lending relationship to force industrial leaders to reduce wages and implement its claim that labor should be an appendage of capitalists. It also said that the new theory of modern masters and servants is enough to limit the progress of the labor movement and advised the industrial community to change its course, increase wages, and shorten working hours, so that the youth of the country can often study in schools and not have to go to factories to work, and develop a spirit of partnership between labor and capitalists.</p>

<h3>Fly Over the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th - US aviators Pangborn and Herndon have created the feat of flying non-stop across the Pacific Ocean. The two flew into the skies of Seattle this morning. The fog was very thick, but they still advanced west, apparently wanting to create a long-distance flight record. Before long, they landed in Wenatchee in central Washington State. There were still about 100 gallons of oil in the plane. If there had been no dense fog, it could have gone much further. After Pangborn landed, he was first greeted by his mother, and his joy can be imagined. A representative of the Asahi Shimbun also presented them with a check for a reward of 25,000 yuan. It is estimated that the distance of this flight by the two was about 5,000 miles, and the average speed per hour was 20 miles per day.</p>

<h3>Shenyang Still in Terror</h3>
<p>Armed Robbers with Permits Rob Freely</p>
<p>No Pedestrians After 5 PM</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: According to refugees who fled from Shenyang yesterday, the banks in Shenyang have not yet reopened. Although the shops have been forced by the Japanese to open, there is little business throughout the day. The financial situation is particularly chaotic. 80+ Feng bills equals 1 silver dollar. The silver dollar bills issued by the Bianye Bank and the Three Northeastern Provinces Official Bank are only traded at 85% of their face value. The market prices change frequently, making it difficult for merchants to cope. Therefore, after 4:00 PM, they completely close their doors. After 5:00 PM, there are no pedestrians on the streets. Merchants have organized self-defense groups, but they have no weapons. Each shop sends only one person, armed with a wooden stick, to patrol in front of the shops for self-defense. They also take turns patrolling at night. If there is an alarm, they all come out to deal with it. The self-defense police of the streets have been given firearms by the Japanese and the so-called "Public Security Maintenance Association." Each person is only allowed to carry five bullets and must hand them over to the next shift after their shift is over. The Japanese are secretly monitoring them. The self-defense police are there to prevent unforeseen events. At night, gunfire is heard everywhere, non-stop throughout the night. It has been found that the gunfire is mostly caused by Korean vagrants and bandits who are robbing everywhere and have been issued protection permits by the Japanese. If they are caught and show their permits, they are immediately released. Those without permits are immediately executed by firing squad. Therefore, these robbers act freely without any hindrance, which is actually under the direction of the Japanese, and is an organized action. As a result, the residents feel even more uneasy, living in fear all day long. The shape of their panic cannot be described in words. The robberies all occur in the southeastern gates and commercial districts because the presence of various foreign consulates prevents the Japanese from allowing the robbers to go there. At present, the Shenyang government offices are still occupied by the Japanese military. The Lumingchun Restaurant, the New Hotel, and the Northeast Grand Theater are all filled with Japanese garrisons. If the Japanese military captures our national soldiers, they burn them to death with kerosene or acid and say, "It's a waste to shoot you with bullets; we should save the bullets for fighting." Their cruelty is such. The Huanggu District Station of the Beining Railway is selling tickets by the British. Each day, they limit the number of tickets sold to 500 or 600. Once the limit is reached, they stop selling. The inspection is not as strict as it was before. The derailed train on the Raoyang River is still lying on its side on the tracks. The people who were crushed to death are still under the train and have not been collected yet. The corpses are gradually decaying. The sight is too terrible to look at. (October 4th)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>The Twelve Days of Occupation in Andong</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Police Still Stationed in the County Government</p>
<p>All Armed Forces in the City Seized</p>
<p>Andong Dispatch: After the Japanese army suddenly invaded the Chinese district at 5:30 AM on September 19th, they immediately occupied various government agencies, disarmed the military and police, and transported all weapons to the Japanese Concession to be inspected and received by the Japanese police station. After the search for weapons from merchants and civilians was completed, the Japanese military commander, Lieutenant Colonel Miura, began planning to protect the security of the Chinese district. At that time, the result of the discussion was that the officers and police of the Commercial District Public Security Bureau would be responsible for security. A portion of the rifles of the officers and police of the bureau were returned to them for suppression, but it was agreed that any temporary theft or other cases should be notified to the Japanese army for assistance. Furthermore, the returned firearms were empty and without ammunition. Therefore, during these twelve days (from the time the Japanese army entered the street until they withdrew, which lasted twelve days and nights), the Chinese police relied on empty guns to be on duty day and night. Fortunately, there was still peace. Also, when the Japanese army entered the street, they first set up their headquarters in the county government. Captain Takamatsu worked in the county government, issuing orders and controlling the Japanese troops. The Japanese military commander, Lieutenant Colonel Miura, was stationed at the Garrison Headquarters in the Japanese Concession. The posting of public notices to reassure the people was all done in the name of Lieutenant Colonel Miura. On the morning of the 27th, Miura summoned the leaders of the Chinese government agencies in his name to gather in the main reception hall of the county government to hold a joint conference of Chinese and Japanese leaders. As a result, Miura stated on the spot that since someone was already responsible for the security of the city and the lives and property of Japanese residents were sufficiently protected, the Japanese troops occupying various government agencies did not need to be stationed for long and would completely withdraw to the Japanese Concession within one or two days. A small team of Japanese military police was dispatched to temporarily station in the Chinese district to protect the public safety of merchants and civilians together with the Chinese police. After the meeting, the Japanese military commander immediately ordered the soldiers occupying various government agencies to prepare to withdraw. At around 10:00 AM on the 29th, a small team of about a dozen Japanese military police arrived from the Japanese Concession and moved into the county government. The citizens heard the news and thought that the Japanese army would withdraw immediately, but they waited until noon and not only did the Japanese army not withdraw, but they also invisibly increased in number, scattered throughout the city. At the same time, the Japanese army still manned the Commercial District Public Security Bureau, and the Japanese army in the county government also continued as usual. As a result, doubts arose among the citizens, and rumors spread. The Japanese army guarding the main gate of the county government set up a Western stove in the main gate hole at night because they were afraid of the cold, burning coal for warmth. At night, the fire was blazing, shining directly outside the gate, causing the Japanese army and the South Manchurian fire brigade's cars to frequently drive out, traveling from the Japanese Concession directly to the Chinese district. The sirens were wailing, and the sound was heard in all directions. The merchants and civilians suspected that there was something else going on and were alarmed and frightened, unable to sleep peacefully all night. At the same time, the Japanese military police stationed in the county government used a rectangular piece of white paper on which was written "Andong Military Police Team" and pasted it on the stone pillar on the right side of the main entrance to the reception hall. The Japanese military police were working inside. At 3:00 PM on the 30th, the Japanese military commander finally ordered the withdrawal to the Japanese Concession. By sunset, there was no trace of the Japanese army in the Chinese district. The fortresses at Daodao Bridge and other places near the Japanese Concession were also lifted of the curfew starting on the evening of the 30th. The guard posts of both the Chinese and Japanese sides were all withdrawn. At this point, the traffic of pedestrians, vehicles, and horses between the two sides was allowed to pass at will without any restrictions. (October 1st)</p>
<h3>National Salvation Movement in Shantou</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The Japanese army's forcible occupation of the three northeastern provinces and resistance against Japan and saving the country has become a national consensus. At 9:00 AM on the 28th, the Shantou City Party Headquarters convened a meeting of representatives from various organizations at the Guangtian Theater to discuss measures against Japan. By 9:00 AM, more than 2,000 representatives had arrived. Those who arrived later were all standing outside the door. The meeting opened at 10:00 AM, and Wu Zifang from the City Party Headquarters, Wang Zhiqian from the Women's Relief Association, Huang Weiqing from the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, Tang Ren from the Education Association, Hong Chunxiu from the Press Association, Ou Huaqi from the National Goods United Association, Yang Boyuan from the Machinery Workers Union, Zhang Youjie from the Hotel and An Workers Union, and Yang Shie from the City Chamber of Commerce were elected as a nine-person presidium, with Wu Zifang as the chairman of the presidium. First, Wu reported on the significance of the meeting, and then representatives from various organizations spoke in turn. At the poignant points, the entire audience applauded thunderously. After speaking for two hours, the discussion of proposals began, lasting three hours. As a result, the following resolutions were made: (1) Establish the Shantou All Circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement Assembly; (2) Punish and warn treacherous merchants, and send letters to the City Chamber of Commerce to notify all merchants that from this day forward, they are not allowed to traffic in Japanese goods; (3) Support peaceful unification; (4) (Omitted); (5) Telegram the government to declare war on Japan; (6) Implement economic severance with Japan, that is, the nine groups in today's presidium were elected as members of the Economic Severance with Japan Committee, which was announced to be established on the same day, and the oath will be taken at the Party Headquarters on October 1 to implement not buying Japanese goods, not taking Japanese ships, and not doing any work for the Japanese. (7) The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association will print the four words "Anti-Japanese National Salvation" on white paper with a blue background and paste them on the doors of shops and households in the city to make people aware and vigilant and never forget. The conference adjourned at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. When discussing the second proposal, the representative of the Cloth Industry Association stood up and stated that because various colleagues had transported five or six hundred boxes of Japanese cloth in the past few days, fearing that subsequent batches of goods would continue to come to Shantou and offend public outrage, a meeting was held on the evening of the 27th to resolve to seal up all the cloth that had been handled by various companies and not allow it to be sold. As for those that had been handled before (referring to before September 18), the Anti-Japanese Association will send personnel to check and seal them separately. After the conference adjourned, the Cloth Industry Association invited the people designated by the presidium to go to the cloth shops to check and seal them. The shops also urgently telegraphed to other ports to stop handling Japanese goods to Shantou to show consistent action. Today, the entire city flew half-mast flags, observed five minutes of silence, and stopped entertainment for three days. The area around the outer road to the front of the Japanese consulate had military police standing guard, and another 50 soldiers and 30 armed police were sent to protect the Japanese consulate. The order in the city was very strict. (September 28th)</p>
<h3>Representatives from Nanjing and Guangdong Travel Together to the Province</h3>

Soon after, the train whistled and arrived at the station. The welcomers all took off their hats and waved their towels to express their welcome, and the music played loudly to express their welcome. As soon as the train stopped, Sun Ke was the first to get off, followed by Wang Jingwei, followed by Chen Mingshu, Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Chaoshu, etc. Li Wenfan followed behind.

<h3>Yu Youren</h3>
<p>Speech at the Central Memorial Week: The Kuomintang in National Crisis</p>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held its 132nd weekly memorial service for the Premier at 9:00 AM on the 5th. Central Committee members Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Chen Guofu, Yu Jingtang, Chen Bulei, Miao Peicheng, Fang Juehui, Zhou Qigang, Chen Lifu, Ke Xinge, as well as staff and guests, totaling about 600 people, attended. Ding Weifen presided over the service and led the ceremonies. Yu Youren gave a report titled "The Party and Party Members in National Crisis." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"The natural and man-made disasters, internal worries and external troubles that China has suffered recently have reached a very critical time. The people of all of China and even the world are watching to see how the Chinese Kuomintang, which established the country through the Party and governs the country through the Party, will overcome these difficulties and dangers, and how it will fulfill its responsibilities of building and governing the country. Therefore, I am specifically proposing the topic of "The Party and Party Members in National Crisis" for this report. Before the revolution, China was oppressed by internal bad politics and invaded by imperialism. The people's livelihoods were cut off, and the national situation was very dangerous. At this time, only revolution could liberate the people and preserve the country. However, the revolution must have a leader. The Premier and the enlightened ones at that time used the organization of the Party to shoulder this leadership responsibility. Only with a revolutionary party can the will be concentrated to guide action. After the establishment of the Party's regime, the Party's political power can be used to realize the people's demands and fulfill the Party's principles. This is the historical mission of a revolutionary political party.</p>
<p>For the sake of China's freedom and equality, and to realize the people's livelihood demands, our Party must make every effort to lead the people throughout the entire course of the revolution and fulfill the historical mission of the revolution. Now that the national crisis is so urgent, why are we still talking about theory? This is because many people have not fully understood the role and significance of the Party in the revolution. Therefore, when a very unusual situation occurs, some erroneous views are expressed. Because of this, it is even more important to point this out specifically in a time of national crisis. First, some people think that today's national crisis only occurred after the Party's revolution. This is a very big mistake. Imperialist aggression is far-reaching and pervasive. Does it mean that if China did not have a revolution, imperialism would not have invaded? I dare to say that if China did not have a revolution, the national crisis would be even worse than today.</p>
<p>Second, some people think that during the Party's period of tutelage, the people had too little power over national affairs. Because the Party was like a "package deal," the people could not directly fulfill their responsibilities. Therefore, foreign aggression took advantage of the opportunity. As a result, some people doubted Party rule and proposed the idea of "returning the government to the people." They did not realize that the Party's tutelage was precisely to enable the people to enter the period of constitutional government. The creation of difficulties at that time is the foundation for the infinite benefits of the future. Moreover, the period of tutelage is only a few years. We cannot allow the people to step into an empty garden of constitutional government without any preparation. As for the people during the period of tutelage, it is by no means that they cannot do their best for national affairs. However, making such a statement of "returning the government to the people" in a time of national crisis is simply trying to get an unorganized people to shoulder very dangerous incidents. It is not only destroying the Party, it is simply destroying the country and the people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some people think that in a time of national crisis, we should indiscriminately attract all parties, even the objects of the revolution, and think that opening the door in this way can save the country, without realizing that all those who have offended the country and the people and hindered the revolution are always trying to take advantage of an opportunity to rise again. If we are not careful, we will fall into their trap, and the national crisis will still be a national crisis. In summary, we can clearly see that some people want to take advantage of the topic of national crisis to do their so-called "destroy the Party to save the country" work. However, we must understand that the Republic of China and the Chinese Kuomintang are the same life. Only with the existence of the Party can the Republic of China exist. Destroying the Party is destroying the Republic of China. There is absolutely no way to save the country by destroying the Party.</p>
<p>As for the matter of internal unity within the Party, all comrades must first take into account the Party itself and the interests of the entire revolution. We have a huge responsibility to the country and the people. Especially in a time of national crisis, a little carelessness on our part will lead to the destruction of the Party and the destruction of the country and the people. Comrades within the Party must immediately and sincerely unite, no longer leave past wounds, make up for past shortcomings, and generate new strength from this. Only then will this unity be a true and sincere unity, and only then can we jointly save the country from danger. Recently, there have been those who have put the Party, government, and military on the same level for comparison. In their eyes, it seems that these three are equally important. This is too ignorant of the Party's organizational system. They then cleverly divide them up, which is most likely to make this meaningless division of fallacies, to the meanings of that comradely sincerity of uniting to go to national crisis are all obliterated. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>The above are all about the Party itself. Now, regarding the Party members, we must first ask what a Party member is. Of course, we usually think that those who are registered with the Party headquarters are Party members. However, I now think that anyone who believes in the Party's principles and accepts training in the exercise of political power is a Party member in the spirit of the Party. Therefore, anyone who is willing to contribute their mind and life to the Three Principles of the People is a Party member. In a time of national crisis, the work of Party members can be expressed anytime and anywhere. It is not necessary to be on the front line to be considered combat or to be considered particularly effective work. Therefore, when Party members receive orders from the Party, they should absolutely obey and absolutely execute them. Moreover, they must go deep into their tasks and make their own efforts to mobilize a local area and mobilize an event. In terms of spirit, they must have long-term continuity. Only then can they expand the Party's life and power through actual struggle. When the country is in trouble, Party members should take every step to prevent and control the enemy. Do not ignore or relax any word or deed, no matter how small. We must ensure that wherever Party members are, the enemy has no way to implement any plans. In this way, it is as if the whole country is covered with our defense works. In the dangerous period of the country, we can get through it quickly. Only in this way can Party members truly become the Party's soldiers, and the Party's central organs can be particularly powerful, because there are no concerns within the Party, and there are extremely precise plans and extremely correct instructions for the outside world. At the same time, our vast spiritual Party members can obtain extremely effective leadership, and the work of saving the country and resisting foreign aggression can have a core.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to explain that when a revolutionary political party establishes a country, it is inevitable that old forces will try to revive, the people's thinking under the new system will waver, and there will be foreign violent aggression. However, all of this was anticipated by the revolutionary political party. For example, in order to achieve China's freedom and equality, our Party must overthrow imperialism. It is impossible for us not to know that Japanese imperialism will definitely invade. However, we will eventually achieve our country's freedom and equality through revolutionary efforts. I remember that when our Party first put forward the slogan of "Down with Imperialism," some people were worried about the Party's strength and feared that it would not be able to do so. The Premier said at that time, "If we do not overthrow imperialism, there is no need for our Party." In light of today, the violent aggression of Japan makes us very vigilant. Therefore, we must firmly and bravely trust ourselves to shoulder this mission. We absolutely believe that the work of saving the country from the current national crisis and the work of achieving national equality, freedom, and satisfying the people's demands in the future will be successful under the leadership of our Party."</p>
<h3>Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>The Water Conservancy Commission Pays Attention to the Dikes and Embankments of Various Townships</p>
<p>Circular Letter to County Governments Requesting Timely Repairs</p>
<p>Considering that this year's floods in the Taihu Lake basin were mostly caused by the neglect of dike and embankment construction in various townships, resulting in a loss of protection, the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission yesterday sent a special letter to the county governments within the basin, requesting them to order the various districts to promptly repair the dikes and embankments to protect farmland and prepare for floods. As for the various technical aspects of surveying and design, the Commission can provide as much assistance as possible at any time. The original letter is as follows: "The Taihu Lake basin is where hundreds of rivers converge and rainfall is abundant, resulting in frequent disasters with floods more common than droughts. Our predecessors emphasized three things in managing the water conservancy of the Wu region: repairing enclosures, dredging rivers, and setting up sluice gates, with the repair of enclosures being the only way to defend the farmland in low-lying areas from floods. Throughout history, such as during the Song Dynasty, water level markers were erected in various counties in western Zhejiang to manage fields and prevent floods; during the Yuan Dynasty, the Jiangzhe Province oversaw the construction of field enclosures; during the Ming Dynasty, officials and civilians alike paid attention to dikes and embankments; the construction of the Wuxi Furong Enclosure by Zhou and Shen, the construction of the Changshu Zhao Duan Enclosure by Bi Heng, and the order to repair the dikes and embankments of various counties in Suzhou and Songjiang by Lin Yingxun all managed to avoid disasters even in years of major floods. These are the most outstanding achievements. However, the water conservancy projects managed during the Qing Dynasty mostly focused on dredging and neglected the construction of dikes and embankments. In recent decades, agricultural administration has long been neglected, and the ancient systems have been completely abandoned. Most of the remaining dikes and embankments in various townships are low and thin, insufficient to resist water. There are even many low-lying areas without any dikes and embankments for protection. As a result, disasters occur every two out of three years, the granaries are empty, and the farmers suffer hardship and have no way to appeal, often attributing it to natural disasters, without realizing that human affairs are not well-managed, how can there be any hope of avoiding it? Since the great flood of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the former Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Bureau once consulted the governors of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to allocate funds and issue orders to</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>the various counties in the Taihu Lake basin to construct dikes and embankments in low-lying areas to prevent floods. Unfortunately, most counties at that time ignored this and did not fully implement it. This year, hailstorms and continuous rain have caused floods throughout the country. This basin has had particularly heavy rainfall. Wherever waterlogging occurs, dikes and embankments are not repaired, and the fields are flooded. The public and private losses are immeasurable. At this time of utter devastation, a plan to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost should be devised. This Commission is responsible for farmland water conservancy in the Taihu Lake basin. It previously sent official letters to the construction bureaus of the various county governments to investigate the flood situation in each county. It also ordered the department to compile special publications based on the maximum and highest accurate figures of rainfall and water levels recorded by various monitoring stations over the years, as well as the causes and conditions of disasters in various places, as references for water management. After detailed research, it was found that although the flood was due to excessive rainfall, in fact, according to statistics, the water levels in various places mostly did not exceed the highest records, but the low-lying farmland was already a vast expanse of water, turning into a swamp. The main reason is the lack of water-blocking dikes and embankments, making it difficult to bail out. Now, during the slack season of winter, your government should consider the local economic situation, either supplementing the shortfall with public funds or using the system of tenant farmers contributing labor to quickly and properly plan for the joint construction of enclosures and the equipment of mechanical bailing in agricultural areas. The relevant measures should be implemented in various districts within this winter season to achieve lasting results, to be prepared for any eventuality, and to ensure prosperity and well-being, which will greatly benefit the local area. As for the consultation of planning, the methods of building dikes, the equipment for bailing water, and the supply of hydrological records and assistance in surveying and design, if your government needs anything in the future, this Commission will do everything within its power to assist in order to promote the realization of these goals. This matter concerns the important plan of managing fields and preventing floods. In addition to submitting this to the Ministry of the Interior and sending separate letters, this letter is hereby sent for your reference and implementation."</p>

<p>Opening of the Bizarre Death Case. A well-known soil vendor, Pao Xiang A'si (i.e., Qian A'si), outside the East Gate of Pinghu, died suddenly within a few hours after being arrested by the county government for a tobacco case last month.

The trial opened on the morning of the 5th. The plaintiff, represented by his nephew Qian Xingsheng, appeared in court and stated that the death of his uncle A'si was unclear, and that the coroner's examination had revealed that he had died from poisoning. However, when A'si was taken to the county, his demeanor was normal. He also had no symptoms of illness during the trial the next day. Unexpectedly, he died less than three hours after arriving in prison. Therefore, his concubine, Yang (i.e., Xiaoyangji), is highly suspected, and a thorough investigation is requested.

<h3>Church Schools Find it Difficult to Reduce Party Principles Courses</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that each school's Party Principles courses should be taught for at least two hours per week. Even church schools cannot be an exception. It specifically instructed the Chahar Education Department, "According to a letter approved by the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, the Standing Committee recently forwarded a presentation from the Beijing Special City Party Affairs Reorganization Committee. The Preparatory Member of the Fifth District Party Department presented that the agenda item 2 of the Educational Administration Conference of the Chahar Province, which was slightly adding Three People's Principles education in church schools, violated the principle of Three People's Principles education. It requested the Central Government to correct it and forward it for review. It was approved and handed over to the Ministry of Education for review. A copy of the original presentation is enclosed for your review and action. The Three People's Principles are the fundamental principles of education in our country and have long been stipulated in the educational purpose announced by the Central Government. The Party Principles course is taught for at least two hours per week, as stipulated in the Interim General Rules for Adding Party Principles Courses in Schools at All Levels. Church schools are one type of private school. Their relationship with the church is only that the founders are church organizations. However, the operation of the school should generally be in accordance with the various laws and regulations promulgated by the Ministry. All courses should not be different from public and other private schools. It is said that the Provincial Education Conference listed church schools as a special education group, which is already inappropriate. The so-called 'slightly adding' the Three People's Principles is even more of a misunderstanding. If this is true, it should be corrected immediately in accordance with the letter's reasons. The original presentation is hereby copied and sent to the department for your immediate investigation, correction, and reporting for verification and forwarding. In addition, the situation of the Provincial Educational Administration Conference has not been reported. Please also respond for verification."</p>

<p>Second Anniversary of Shanghai Second College</p>

It has long been trusted by the society. Yesterday (the 6th) was the second anniversary of the establishment of the college. Originally, it was planned to hold a grand celebration and the completion ceremony of the new college building at the same time. However, due to the national crisis and the indignation of the whole country, the staff and students of the college made every effort to carry out anti-Japanese propaganda work and had no time to engage in display. Only a routine commemorative meeting was held in the auditorium at 10:00 AM that day. A total of more than 200 faculty, staff, and students attended. It was led by the head of the school, Li Peitian. The formal greetings were performed, and the establishment of the college was reported, the future development plan, and the students' anti-Japanese national salvation policy were instructed. Then, professors Huang Puxin, Ren Qishan, Zhang Xiangshi, etc., successively lectured on anti-Japanese national salvation methods and the current international situation to students, in order to deeply understand the situation.

They stayed in the new house last night. This afternoon, according to the scheduled order, they will play against the Shanghai champion catcher team. However, due to the torrential rain last night, whether the venue can be used is still a question.</p>

<p>Midfielder Talk</p>
<p>Yesterday I met Feng Yulin, the midfielder of the Malayan team, and asked about the formation of the Malayan team and the situation in the north. Regarding the last few minutes of the National Games, the temporary announcement of the postponement was regrettable, causing the overseas athletes to work in vain. They arrived in Hong Kong and fought against the Hong Kong Chinese team. The first battle was held the day after arriving in Hong Kong. Most of the team members felt tired from the sea voyage, so they lost 1-4. Feng did not participate in this battle. In the second and third battles, they retaliated with 3-1 and 2-1 consecutive victories. The South China team is strong in Hong Kong. According to Feng's observation, there are many talented people in the forwards.</p>
<p>A Small Test of Feet</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the whole team practiced in the baseball field. The hard feet are rare in Shanghai. The wings are powerful and hooked. The spectators were amazed. It is expected that Western Catcher will be their defeated general, accounting for eight or nine out of ten.</p>
<p>In Shanghai Conduct</p>
<p>丨 The Day After Tomorrow to Fight the Chinese Team 丨</p>
<p>The team is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for four or five days. The day after tomorrow, they will fight against the All-Shanghai Chinese team. They will visit Beijing and then return south.</p>

<h3>Heartfelt Words</h3>
<p>— Cuckoo</p>
<p>Dear compatriots. When we see the violent sun, we don't know how to repent. Instead, we warn our country. Aren't we frightened and strange, and indignant? But. Please don't be frightened. Please don't be strange. Please don't be indignant. We still have to thank the violent sun from the bottom of our hearts. It gives us a major stimulus, so that our determination to economically sever relations with Japan and boycott Japanese goods is more firm and lasting. As long as we are human beings for one day, we have to boycott Japanese goods for one day. Resolutely boycott it. Until ten years or a hundred years, there is no view of the number of years. And in these three or five years. We can watch the violent sun can't eat it. Can you wrap it up?</p>
<p>If You Don’t Remove the Grass in the Garden, the Husband Will Talk</p>
<h3>Master Shi's Speech to the People</h3>
<p>Although Master Shi Kefa died 286 years ago, his spirit has not died. He is still alive among us, forever alive. Listen to his speech! 287 years ago, Li Zicheng captured Beijing, Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself, and the Qing army entered the customs and broke Li Zicheng, occupying the Ming Dynasty. The southern generals discussed establishing King Fu. Shi Gong was jealous of Ma Shiying and others, and asked himself to be a master to defend Xinyang. After offering sacrifices to the two mausoleums, he wrote to King Fu:</p>
<p>"If you are comfortable in the southeast and don't think about far-reaching strategies, if you can't distinguish between the wise and the treacherous, if your prestige is not effective, if the veterans throw their hairpins, if the heroes are inside and out, if the ancestors are grieved, if the destiny of heaven is shifting, if the corner of the southeast cannot be guaranteed."</p>
<p>At that time, the southern ministers did not realize it, and pushed all the guilt of the country's demise on the northern ministers, but Shi Gong alone spoke fairly:</p>
<p>"All the officials in the North Capital are guilty of the changes. Those in the north should die, can't those who follow the south be ministers?"</p>
<p>In November, the Qing army entered Suqian and attacked Pizhou again. He also wrote:</p>
<p>"The general can overcome the enemy, the monarch can control the general, the temple will not be encouraged, then the line will not be encouraged."</p>
<p>In the same memorial, he also said:</p>
<p>"There are not many officials in the north who died for their festivals, and there are officials in the south who conquer thieves: This is the shame of 13,000."</p>
<p>What should we think when we read this? Now it is a democratic country. The people are the monarch. The public servant replaces the minister, so which of Shi Gong's words is not relevant to the current malpractices?</p>
<p>On April 15, 1645 AD, the Qing army attacked Yangzhou. Shi Gong's lone army fought bloody battles for ten days. Dodo wrote five times to persuade him to surrender, but he did not open them. After the city was broken, he committed suicide unsuccessfully and was taken away by the Qing army. Dodo treated him like a guest, calling him "Mr." and said, "Now that loyalty and righteousness have been achieved, Mr. will clean up Jiangnan for me, and I will not spare any heavy responsibilities." Shi Gong said angrily, "The head can be broken, but the body cannot be bent!"</p>
<p>This is the last sentence that Master Shi practiced himself, and it is also his immortal will to the Chinese nation for billions of years. Can we forget it?</p>
<p>The History of the Ming Dynasty calls Shi Gong "short and lean, with a black face and sparkling eyes, incorruptible, trustworthy, and equally hardworking with his subordinates. The army does not eat before the soldiers are full, and does not serve before clothing is given, so they can die for the soil." When we read this passage, we know that Shi Gong's loyalty and patriotic service is not accidental.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the demise of the Ming Dynasty. The main ones were the mediocrity of the masters, the greed of the officials, and the few Shi Kefas, while there were too many Wei Zhongxians and Wu Sanguis. Wei Zhongxian and Wu Sangui rose too early, while Shi Kefa rose too late. How many Shi Kefas are there in the Republic of China? When will they come out?</p>
<h3>Heroic and Enthusiastic Women's National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Japanese are rejoicing in misfortune and forcibly occupying our land and killing our compatriots. When the bad news came, everyone was filled with righteous indignation. The Shanghai women's circles believe that everyone, both men and women, is responsible for the rise and fall of the world. Therefore, they jointly organized the Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance to resist Japan. The founding meeting was held on October 1. This matter is unprecedented in the women's circles. Therefore, I will record the unreported details of various newspapers as follows.</p>
<p>On this day, at the entrance of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. There is a horizontal plaque with the words "Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance Founding Meeting" in eleven characters.</p>
<h3>World Miscellany</h3>
<p>New Welsh Snail</p>
<p>Racing Popular in the West</p>
<p>Westerners are often imaginative when it comes to games, creating many new variations. Recently, in Wales, western England, someone initiated snail racing, which has become quite popular. Snails are known for being slow, but now they are being raced, making the spectators very interested. It is said to be as exciting as watching horse or dog races, with the same stimulating effect. After a round of snail racing, winners and losers are determined, so people can bet on them. The fun is naturally the same as horse or dog racing, with the added incentive of money.</p>
<p>In London, England, there is said to be a similarly whimsical competition, much like the snail racing in Wales. They are using crows for racing, organized by several beautiful young men trying to make a name for themselves in social circles. It has been held several times recently at various entertainment gatherings, attracting considerable interest from spectators. However, crows need to be bought, unlike snails, which can be found by the roadside or on walls. Therefore, it is not as widely popular as snail racing in Wales.</p>
<p>Two lines of Boy Scouts, fully armed, looked very imposing. A banner with the four characters "Recover Our Territory" was hung over the entrance, with a couplet beside it: "One heart, one mind, jointly plan to save the country" and "Unyielding and unswerving, unite and move forward." The meeting place was in the assembly hall. A registration desk was set up at the entrance. After signing in, each person was given a red heart badge with the character "決" (determination) embedded in it, symbolizing their determination to resist Japan and save the country. The reverse side was printed with the words "Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance, united struggle, October 1, Republic of China Year 20." Everyone wore black纱 on their arms and red badges on their chests, which was striking. The four walls of the meeting place were covered with slogans such as "To achieve the final victory, we must have economic severance," "Our three-year determination can control the short slaves' lives," "Resisting Japanese goods is the responsibility of our women," and "Those who can keep the oath of today's meeting have hope for saving the country." When Liu Wang Liming gave the opening speech, she said that the women's circles in our country have never been involved in national affairs. Today's action is unprecedented, so that all countries will know that the sleeping lion of the East has awakened, and the sick man of East Asia is healthy. Upholding conscience and advocating justice, on this day, the meeting was scheduled to not allow men to enter except for the press. Later, because the representative sent by the Social Bureau was male, a special exception was made. Yan Baoheng, the executive director of the Liaoning YMCA, and Wu Mai, the propaganda committee member of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, were also invited. Mr. Yan left Liaoning on September 22 and personally witnessed the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers. Therefore, he reported in detail the tragic situation he saw from the evening of the 18th to the 21st. Finally, he said that the Japanese occupied with military force, and we must recover with military force. It is useless to rely on negotiations. The compatriots in the Northeast have suffered a lot this time, so they have the determination that when this case is concluded in the future, no matter who signs a treaty that loses power and humiliates the country, they will rise up and cut off the hand that signed it, to show that they will be abandoned by all. Everyone applauded. Mr. Wu said that our country has boycotted Japanese goods many times, but the results have always been a failure, leading to today's events. I am very excited to see the red heart badge of your association. I hope to preserve this badge and deeply imprint the words printed on the badge in my mind and never forget it. Among the proposals, in addition to what was reported in this newspaper yesterday, someone suggested that women going out to buy goods do not have the ability to distinguish goods, and requested that each store clearly mark domestic goods, and print the words "If it is Japanese goods, the refund will be returned" on the instruction manual, so that it can be exchanged after a mistaken purchase. When discussing the regulations, Liu Wang Liming declared the use of the four characters "eliminate the strong power" in the regulations. When electing executive committee members and staff of various departments, it was proposed by one person and seconded by two people before being put to a vote. Thousands of jade arms were raised. It looked very beautiful. When taking the oath, the voices were clear and crisp, with激昂 and慷慨意. A full of hot blood could be seen. If 200 million female compatriots can rise up to resist Japan and save the country, Japan, though strong, is not enough to worry about. The proverb says that the will of the people is like a fortress. Please unite and do not be discouraged.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Clever Servants</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Records of Yanjing extensively describe the cunning and craftiness of servants in Beijing, portraying their behavior in detail.</p>
<p>All construction and purchase of goods are mostly handled by the stewards. The steward first fixes a bribe with a merchant in the market to inflate the price, and then brings him into the house. If the master dismisses him and asks him to find another place, even if he changes several merchants, the price doubles each time. The master has no choice but to eventually accept the initial price. When selling goods, peddlers or shops in Beijing always raise the price when they encounter noble people. Servants, however, can get them at the regular price. I once stood at the door and asked the price of a crab-carrying vendor. It was very expensive. Later, I went back inside and asked a servant to buy it, and it was half the previous price. I couldn't figure out why. Later, I asked someone who had traveled for a long time, and they all said that they rarely trade with noble people and often trade with servants. If they sell to noble people at the regular price, it will disrupt the servants' inflated prices. As a result, the servants scold each other and tell each other, and no one will trade with them again. Therefore, they must raise the price when trading with noble people.</p>
<p>Servants inflate prices and collude with each other to deceive their superiors. Even Southern servants who have just arrived in Beijing make agreements with each other in the market, privately setting the amount of inflated prices. They speak with one voice, making it impossible for the master to investigate. Those who are honest and do not join their group are beaten. Everyone who has lived in Beijing for a long time knows this situation. However, because Beijing servants are respectful, know etiquette, and serve well, people get used to it and accept it. It is better to be slightly deceived than to personally haggle over every penny in the market. In recent years, the restrictions of social class have been removed. Southerners who live in Beijing are more accustomed to market transactions, so the skills of extravagant servants are gradually losing their effectiveness. Middle-class families mostly do not use male servants, which reduces the disadvantages even more. However, the cunning of female servants is still not easy to guard against. Those who introduce female servants are commonly called matchmakers. Matchmakers are necessarily women who are familiar with the ways of the world and accept dirt and filth, which is self-evident. If a family needs to hire a female servant, they always consider the family background and the master's personality and habits to choose someone suitable for them. When they first arrive, they must be sweet-tongued and use gentle expressions to flatter the master. The first three days are called a trial period. If they are not suitable, they will leave. However, they often ask to leave before the trial period is over, because they profit from collecting wages on a daily basis. The matchmaker earns a cart fee each time they send someone. If they settle down and do not leave, they must first take a month's salary and give a quarter to the matchmaker. There are still regular practices every three festivals. Matchmakers profit from the frequent changing of masters by female servants, and female servants never intend to settle in one place. They steal small things like rice and coal on a daily basis and resell them in stores to make a small profit. If they have a slightly better appearance, they may collude with the servants and commit adultery and theft. These are all commonly heard things. In the past, wages were very low. Recently, the standard is three yuan per month. However, what these people hope for is that the master will give them gifts when drinking and gambling, so they can get extra income. Even if their wages are increased, it is not enough to satisfy them. Therefore, families with few social interactions find it especially difficult to hire people. In short, bad habits are not easy to change.</p>
<p>Like a forest. It is very beautiful. When taking the oath, the sound was crisp and clear, with 격앙 and 慷慨意. A full cavity of hot blood can be seen. If 200 million female compatriots can rise up to resist Japan and save the country, Japan, though strong, is not enough to worry about. The proverb says that the will of the people is like a fortress. Please unite and do not be discouraged.</p>
<h3>Shocked Recollections of Returning from Shenyang</h3>
<p>— Ms. Wu Wei</p>
<p>I once read a poem by Du Fu, saying, "Still frightened to this day, there should be souls not yet summoned." Since I returned from Shenyang, I have been shocked and thought about the shock. My dreams of returning home are shaky, as if there are still souls that have not been summoned. Because of the world trend, regardless of gender, it is appropriate to study. I have always received family training and have been in school for many years. I am fortunate to have some knowledge and think about making progress every day. I especially like law, politics, science, and chemistry. Not necessarily with any extravagance, thinking that if people can understand these two, they will not go astray in life. Investigating things and extending knowledge can especially make scientific inventions apply to the world and not lead to the outflow of interests. This autumn, I was admitted to Feng Yong University in Shenyang. On the morning of September 13, I took the Changchun Maru from Shanghai to the north. I arrived in Qingdao on the 14th, Dalian on the 15th, and went to Shenyang on the South Manchuria Railway on the 16th, entering Feng Yong University. It was already dusk. I planned to complete the admission procedures and live in the school dormitory. At that time, school had already started. I immediately attended classes with the class. For two days, I repeatedly went to the telegraph office to send news home, but the telegram did not go through. I went to the bank to withdraw the money I had remitted, but I could not receive it. I felt very strange. I knew that the situation had changed. I thought that when I passed Dalian, Uncle Sun and others all advised me not to go north. Did they hear something? As a weak woman, I went thousands of miles to study. I had just unloaded my luggage when I suddenly encountered a change in the situation. My family had no news, and everyone was panicked and uneasy for a long time. So I decided to ask to leave the school and return south. On the afternoon of the 18th, at 8:00 p.m., I packed my luggage and boarded the train. After traveling for three hours, I suddenly heard loud cannon fire that shook the sky. Before long, it was reported that the railway had been cut off. It was shocking and terrifying. Everyone on the train was trembling with fear. It was not until the 21st that I took a boat from Dalian back to the south. I arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 p.m. on the 23rd. I was happy and relieved to see my parents and siblings. Later, I learned that Principal Feng had been detained by Japanese soldiers, and the students had scattered, with some unable to return home. It was miserable. How dangerous! If I had hesitated a little longer, I would have been in danger. The train I took was the last train. After that, there were no more trains. Thinking back on this trip, it was like a dream. How can I not be shocked and think about the shock? (Move the reward to help with disaster relief)</p>
<p>Notice from this publication: In the article "Seven-Day Diary of Liaoning" written by Mr. Zheng Junping, which was published yesterday, in the thirty-fifth line, there is "......The Japanese side had 30 conditions and gave our side 24 hours to respond. Our side ignored it......" It is said that another gentleman who returned from Shenyang, who had been avoiding the disaster, said that there was no such thing. We are deeply afraid that all parties will misunderstand, so we solemnly declare this.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Storytelling</p>
<h3>The Pestle of Knocking on Dreams (7)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Although Pei Shi was scolded by his teacher, he did not change his work with knives and awls. He continued his deep research on manufacturing. The results of his work over the days and months could truly break records in the history of art. The wooden dog he made, placed beside the door, had a squatting posture that could be mistaken for the real thing. When someone pushed the door open and touched the mechanism, the wooden dog could bark wildly. The sound of the bark could also be mistaken for the real thing. Other ingenious devices that he manufactured emerged one after another, all of which were beneficial for practical use. Unfortunately, Pei Shi's father was a person who worshiped the eight-legged essay. He believed that the eight-legged essay was the only art. He had a deep and intense aversion to Pei Shi's creation of mechanical things. He repeatedly scolded his son and pasted a sign next to him that said, "Do not do what is useless and harm what is useful."</p>
<p>Old Man Pei was wrong! He designated mechanical work as useless and the eight-legged essay as useful. He only somersaulted through the list of successful candidates in the imperial examinations before expressing such a fallacy. However, the public opinion at the time, whether old, young, wise, or foolish, mostly sympathized with Old Man Pei and not with Little Pei, thinking that Pei Shi was a true fool, a true idiot, a true idiot, and should not give up the eight-legged essay that could glorify his ancestors and work on ingenious mechanical devices. It was not surprising that others judged Pei Shi in this way. The most surprising thing was that Tao Chi, who was born with a 20th-century brain but sat in an 18th-century revolving chair, also joined the many old, young, wise, and foolish people in criticizing his classmate and friend Pei Shi.</p>
<p>What about Pei Shi? He did hold on to the belief of not doing what is useless and harming what is useful. However, his vision was different from Old Man Pei's. He designated the eight-legged essay as useless and mechanical work as useful. The public opinion, like a surging tide, could not shake his intellectual headquarters. He only devoted himself to one of his ideals, a method for a small car to travel freely on two wires.</p>

<h3>New Information on Long-Term Loans for the Second Half of the Year</h3>
<p>This year, the prospects for Chinese commercial operations are mostly viewed pessimistically. Initially, floods in various parts of Hunan and Hubei caused stagnation of goods and financial paralysis. Now, they are also affected by the anti-Japanese goods movement. However, in the financial world, the end of the tenth month is generally considered the deadline for settling long-term loans of forty taels per month. The deadline for the second half of the year is not far off, and the settlement dates for the 10th and 15th are fast approaching. Based on past years and normal circumstances, there should be a flourishing atmosphere, even slightly better than the first half of this year. However, the current movements in the financial world are surprisingly quiet. It is reported that long-term deposits in various parts of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, recognizing the difficulties faced by the Shanghai market, have decided to protect and assist it by not withdrawing any funds and rolling them over in full. As for how to handle outstanding long-term loans, there is no certainty yet.</p>
<p>Securities: Bond Prices Fluctuate, Trend is Sideways with Slight Ups and Downs; November Futures Still Have No Trading. Yesterday (the 6th), the market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange showed that in the spot market, only the Disbandment Bonds traded for one thousand yuan in the afternoon. Other bonds remained unopened. Only the January futures contract continued to be available, and the market remained quiet. Regarding the bond prices, despite the lack of positive developments in the diplomatic situation and the increasing pressure from the Japanese, the approach to peace with Guangdong was closer than before. The financial authorities also declared their efforts to maintain stability, and market sentiment stabilized somewhat. The market was quite chaotic for a time, with bond prices rising and falling, shifting according to the immediate demand for bonds in the market, with no consistent trend. The market continued to move sideways, with slight ups and downs. As a result, except for the 20 series of bonds, which continued to fall by 1.6 yuan, the 20 Customs, the 19 Benevolent Disbandment, and others also fell by about 1 yuan. The Salt Tax and the Sixth Year issues all rose by 7-8 jiao, and the 19 Customs and Disbandment issues also strengthened slightly. The bond market seemed to have reached a considerable limit in its decline. Since last month, various bond statistics have shown declines of about 15-16 yuan. If there were to be further substantial declines, investors would not be able to bear it, and their efforts to maintain prices would be natural. Investors who were watching from the sidelines seemed to be taking the opportunity to buy at low prices. However, based on the current environment, without a turnaround in diplomacy, it would be difficult to expect a large rebound. The total value of futures trading in the morning was over 7 million, and in the afternoon it was about 2.8 million, for a total of 9.875 million yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market in a Frenzy of Falling Prices; The yarn market is very weak, and the price declines are particularly severe. The uncertain drop in American cotton prices and the rumors circulating in the market are causing anxiety and speculative sentiment. Furthermore, the slump in raw cotton has worsened the yarn market. At the same time, sales of spot yarn have also been sluggish, resulting in an especially weak market.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Plunge by Three Taels. Before the opening of the foreign yarn market, due to the continued decline in American cotton prices, speculative sentiment was especially strong. Prices fell by 1.2, 3, and 4 qian. In the afternoon, the situation weakened further, with prices falling by 1.5 to 2.1 taels. The total volume of transactions was 27,000 bales.

<h3>Cotton Prices Plunge by One Tael This Month</h3>
<p>The cotton market continues to decline sharply. The relentless fall in American cotton prices, coupled with the weak exchange rate and cheap silver calculations, has made it difficult for buyers to stabilize. As a result, the market has continued to decline. Many small speculators have had to painfully close their positions to meet margin calls. In general, the global situation is unfavorable. However, after a large drop, a small rebound may be possible.</p>

<p>Grain: Clear Weather Causes New Early Rice to Fall by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market in Nantou saw arrivals of goods from around the 30th, and transactions were sluggish. Due to the clear weather, the number of buyers from various shops was slightly reduced. New early rice varieties fell by 4-5 jiao. New foreign Du Jian and early/late rice had little demand, falling slightly. However, thick Japonica rice was in short supply, and prices remained unchanged. The sales of Bianyin Yuan tea snacks were fair, and prices remained stable. New Baige rice from Fengjing entered the market with excellent quality, opening at a price of 14.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at Xinzha, sources from various routes were still abundant. The number of people in the market in the morning was extremely low, and sentiment was soft. The price of new early Japonica rice was lower by one chi. Thin and thick Japonica rice arrivals were not significant, and there were no transactions among customer guilds. There was not much trading within the local market, and prices eased by one jiao. Arrivals and sales of new Lu Yangjian were evenly matched, and prices remained unchanged. Yesterday, at 3:00 PM, a survey found a total of 300 rice boats, each carrying about 100 shi.</p>
<p>The total amount of rice in storage is estimated to be around 30,000 dan.</p>
<h3>There Are Inquiries from Northern Merchants for Spot Small Broken Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw slightly active spot trading. Local merchants purchased over 1,000 bags of Saigon small broken rice, etc. Northern merchants from places like Tianjin are planning to purchase shipments here because sales are slightly more active in those areas. Yesterday, there were negotiations for 2,400 bags of spot small broken rice, but no agreement was reached due to price disagreements. However, the market is showing signs of activity. Tongshi offered 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice at 12.2 yuan per bag, and 500 bags of small broken rice at 10.04 to 10.07 yuan per bag. As for futures, there were transactions for three tons of November-dated small broken rice (overweight) at 5.2 taels per ton, and another 50 tons at 5.17 taels. There was also 100 tons of November-dated No. 1 Saigon at 5.75 taels per ton, which is slightly lower than the previous market price.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw no major inquiries for spot goods. However, merchants from Tianjin are shipping a portion of their orders to Tianjin, as sales have been very good in that area recently. There were no inquiries for new transactions. The futures market situation was even worse, as the arrival of foreign wheat and falling prices have had a significant impact. Furthermore, the poor state of the economy, fluctuating sentiment, and tight credit have caused trading to stall. After the market opened, prices fell across the board for all months. The afternoon was even weaker, with prices for February and March falling by as much as two taels. Although the market showed some signs of stabilizing at the close, the situation remained unfavorable. Closing prices were as follows: October - down 2.5 fen, November/December - down 2.75 fen, January - down 3.5 fen, February - down 3 fen, and March - down 2.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Plunges Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw prices plunge across the board after opening in the morning, falling by 3-5 fen for all months. The continued fall in foreign wheat by 4-5 jiao, along with the arrival of the first batch of 30,000 tons of American disaster relief wheat, has significantly weakened sentiment and increased selling pressure. In the afternoon, long positions turned into short positions, and the market became even more unsustainable. Closing prices were as follows: November, February, and March - down 8 fen; October and January - down 7 fen; and December - down 5 fen. There has been no demand from mills for spot wheat for a long time. Yesterday, a factory purchased just over 100 bags of Gaoyou wheat at 3.25 taels, down 3-4 qian from the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Opens Higher</p>
<p>The planned trading session was quiet and the market was firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams stating that the current price of Cuban sugar was 1.4375, a slight increase of 0.03125 from the previous telegram. New York sugar futures were priced at 1.36 for December, 1.34 for March of next year, 1.39 for May, and 1.46 for September, with only minor fluctuations. The current price of refined Javanese sugar was 7.50, and the prices for sugar futures for all months were 7.625, also remaining unchanged. The market in the Public Association was quiet and trading was very quiet. The price for Dutch No. 24 coarse white sugar in white bags was 11.4 taels for old stock and 11.5 to 11.55 taels for new stock. The price for No. 20 medium white sugar was 10.09 taels. The price for fine Dutch white sugar was 12.025 to 12.05 taels. The market was still performing fairly well. Small transactions of Taikoo Sugar B mark were made at 12.3 taels, and the rest were quiet. The company sold 15,000 bags of November shipments at 8.4 taels for B mark, 8.35 taels for CW mark, 8.25 taels for DY mark, 8.15 taels for HX mark, and 11.85 taels for HM mark, all with the new tax included. The trend was stable. Large Chang Foreign Firm was offering 300 tons of mid-sized Dutch white sugar for shipment in October and November at a price of 5.3 Dutch guilders. Hua Xinhao sold 300 tons of No. 8 Dutch red sugar at 5.15 guilders, as well as three tons of thin Dutch white sugar at 6.05 guilders. Old coarse white sugar was also offered at 200 tons at 5.55 guilders. All goods are for shipment in October and November. The agency is showing strong interest, so the market has been fully opened.</p>
<p>Textiles: Melton and Mǎkù Ní Fabrics Both Decline; Melton is used exclusively for Western-style suits, so most of it is used by Western tailors. A large number of military uniforms and livery are also made from this material, so the demand for Melton has not been weak recently. However, there have been many arrivals of new goods, and selling prices have been declining. Yesterday, Ningfeng Dashijiang Melton was selling for 2.1 taels per yard less, Shunquanlong Jinghuayuan for 1.775 taels less, Huabolianhuan Tu for 2.2 taels less, and Tianxiang first-class and second-class for 2.25 and 1.8 taels less, respectively, all about 0.1 tael lower than last month.</p>
<p>Mǎkù Ní is a popular wool fabric that was introduced two years ago. It is the exclusive material for light overcoats in the spring, and its sales are also wide. Local demand accounts for 60-70% of the total. During the first half of the year, in the spring, it was selling for 8.25 taels per yard, and the trend was very active. The market is now sluggish. The highest quality goods are now selling for only 7.5 taels per yard, which is a drop of 1 yuan per yard compared to the first half of the year. The decline can be considered quite significant. The reason for this is that the market was too good in the first half of the year, and the number of orders increased sharply, resulting in a surplus of goods and an oversupply in the market.</p>
<p>Coal: Domestic Coal Sales Are Quite Brisk</p>
<p>Since the boycott of Japanese goods due to the anti-Japanese movement, sales of domestic Boshan Unified Coal have been brisk in this city, with daily transactions often reaching 500-600 tons. Yesterday, more than 3,000 tons of new goods arrived, selling for 11.25 taels per ton. In addition, a large amount of Beipiao coal dust has been shipped to Wuxi and Suzhou recently. Yesterday, another 340 tons were unloaded, selling for 10 taels per ton.</p>
<p>Hardware: Sales of Military Hardware Are Booming</p>
<p>Since the invasion of the Eastern Provinces by the Japanese, hardware transactions have become more structured. However, sales of military hardware have been particularly active recently. Yesterday, over 400 dan of purple copper, 1,000 dan of green lead, 600-700 dan of white lead, 200 bundles of black iron sheets, 300-400 dan of tinplate and white lead sheets, and over 300 dan of small hardware were offered. However, according to investigations, these goods were purchased by Nanjing. It is said that further purchases are planned. Although the market in this city has seen large-scale offerings, the market situation has remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 12,000 pieces of Rock Sugar Shipped from Hong Kong; 1,000 pieces of White Iron Sheets Shipped from the United States; 400 pieces of English Woolen Fabrics Arrived; 1,200 Tons of Tea Bricks Shipped to Russia; 1,600 pieces of Plain Cloth Shipped to the Yangtze River; 1,700 Tons of Machinery and Steel Shipped from England and Belgium to Shanghai; 1,100 pieces of American Cotton Shipped to Hunan; 6,100 pieces of Shear Mouth Iron Shipped to Hankou; 1,000 cases of Cigarettes Shipped to Nanyang.</p>

<p>Essential Points of Telegrams The Shanghai Lawyers Association yesterday submitted a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters of the Capital National Government, Nanjing, stating: To the esteemed Central Party Headquarters of the National Government, this time, Japan has not hesitated to trample on international law, destroy peace in East Asia, attack and occupy our territory, massacre our people, rob our property, occupy our official offices, and usurp our political power. Its brutality and cruelty are unrestrained. Our hundreds of thousands of Northeast soldiers are like walking corpses and clay and wooden puppets, offering no resistance and allowing them to do as they please. This kind of extraordinary humiliation and shame is ten thousand times greater than defeat on the battlefield. The Northeast officials, even if they die ten thousand times, cannot escape responsibility. However, Lushun and Dalian have been occupied by the violent Japanese by lease, and their military and economic resources have been used as sources of strategy. The South Manchuria Railway allows the stationing of troops, and the powerful enemy has long entered our bedside, and the defenses have been completely removed. Even if there are loyal and brave officers and soldiers, they will suffer from the difficulty of preventing the unpreventable. In order to eradicate the source of the disaster and ensure permanent peace, we must urgently recover Lushun, Dalian, and the South Manchuria Railway, and abolish the old treaties allowing foreign troops to be stationed within our borders, as the fundamental way to save us from danger and death. The current efforts of our diplomatic authorities to seek redress from the League of Nations, and the resolutions made by the League of Nations, are only aimed at having the Japanese troops withdraw to the original defense lines along the South Manchuria Railway. With the root of the problem not removed, the national crisis will not end. This has caused infinite disappointment to our entire nation. While the League of Nations may mediate disputes and put on a show of handling things as an initial measure, our country, which has suffered deep wounds and heavy losses, must rectify the situation at its root in order to seek long-term security. Since the violent Japanese have violated treaties and destroyed the law first, we, in order to defend ourselves and survive, can make corresponding demands afterwards. Otherwise, the entire territory of Liaoning and Jilin will be under the threat of Lushun, Dalian, and the South Manchuria Railway. With the enemy watching closely like eagles and tigers, there are dangers lurking everywhere, ready to erupt at any moment. Our great rivers and mountains will ultimately not belong to us. In the opinion of our association, the current negotiations must aim for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in the Eastern Provinces, completely leaving our national territory, and the complete return of Lushun, Dalian, and the South Manchuria Railway to our country, as the minimum goal for a thorough resolution of the anti-Japanese policy. We deeply hope that our entire nation will unite as one, strive and fight to the death for it. If we shrink back and procrastinate, and do not focus on this, then the balance of power will be broken, and the disaster of partition will be impossible to prevent. It will no longer be possible for us, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, to extend our lineage and build our nation forever on the East Asian continent. Even Turkey, after its devastating defeat in war, was able to use its skills to restore its long-lost national rights. Our government, leading four hundred million people and possessing the entire territory of the East Asian continent, should not underestimate ourselves and be inferior to even a small, insignificant country like Turkey. We earnestly hope that a policy towards Japan will be quickly determined to eliminate the source of disaster in the Eastern Provinces and lay the foundation for a safe national territory. We offer these words with bleeding hearts, and humbly request your wise consideration. The Shanghai Lawyers Association respectfully kowtows. Official seal.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Work in All Sectors</p>
<p>Silk Gauze Industry Cancels Japanese Yarn Orders The Silk Gauze Trade Association held a joint meeting of executive committee members and silk gauze industry representatives on the 1st.

It was also decided to hold the first preparatory meeting of the Volunteer Army on the 6th to discuss all matters.</p>
<p>Resolutions of the Chinese Western Medicine Association The Anti-Japanese Working Committee of the Chinese Western Medicine Association held its first meeting yesterday. Chairman Ye Qubo discussed and resolved the following measures: (1) Send letters to various medical and pharmaceutical organizations to jointly organize the Shanghai New Medical and Pharmaceutical Industry Anti-Japanese National Salvation Working Committee, in order to expand work and achieve lasting results with collective efforts. (2) Collect Japanese medicine leaflets and product descriptions from other countries' pharmaceutical factories, and investigate domestic medicines that can replace Japanese goods, in order to compile publications that boycott Japanese goods and promote substitutes. (3) Create pharmaceutical factories and medical equipment factories, invent new drugs, in order to actually boycott and recover profits. (4) Send a letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for filing. (5) Organize an inspection team to register and seal Japanese medicines. (6) Send a letter to the New Medicine Industry requesting that all domestic new medicines be reported to the association immediately. (7) Solicit obligation advertising slogans.</p>
<p>Drivers Voluntarily Resign from Japanese Employers Mr. Qiao, who worked as a driver for a Japanese man at the Mitsui 洋行 on Sichuan Road, has been with the company for more than ten years. The car owner increased his salary from a few yuan to fifty yuan because of his honesty and reliability. Recently, Mr. Qiao resigned from his car owner in protest of the Japanese's arrogance. The Japanese man asked him, "You have been with me for many years, and I have treated you well. Is this resignation voluntary or forced?" Mr. Qiao replied, "Because the Japanese army has forcibly occupied our territory and massacred our compatriots, I am embracing a policy of non-cooperation. This is purely my personal choice and not forced." However, the Japanese man said, "Since you are so determined, I cannot retain you. However, how will your family's livelihood be maintained in the future? I hope you will think it over to avoid regret, or you can come back to me when the situation is calmer." Mr. Qiao resolutely replied, "Unless the Japanese army returns our three northeastern provinces and compensates us for all our losses, I may come back to resume my post. Otherwise, I would rather starve to death than come back."</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Enrollment in Women's Volunteer Army Ms. Shao Xiangling, Ms. Tang Baiyu, and Ms. He Jinzhi of this city's women's community initiated the organization of a women's volunteer army.

<h3>Western Consul Set Off for Liaoning Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Main Purpose of the Mission is Investigation 　　 The Results of the Investigation Will Be Reported to the Western Foreign Minister　　 The Japanese Side Expressed That They Do Not Oppose It The Spanish Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Fur, has left Shanghai on the morning of yesterday at 9 am on the Dalian Steamship Company's Fengtian Maru with his two daughters to Dalian under the instruction of Mr. Lele, the chairman of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, and then to Liaoning, Jilin and other places for investigation. The talk of Mr. Fei and the attitude of the Japanese side are recorded below.</p>
<p>Contents of the Instruction According to the secretary of the Spanish Consulate to the reporter of the New Sound Agency, the instruction of Mr. Lele to Consul General Fei to go to Manchuria for investigation is in the name of the Spanish Foreign Minister, but the work done is related to the international community. The main purpose of the content of his instruction is investigation, and the points that should be paid attention to in the investigation are: (1) The matter of independence of Liaoning and Jilin; (2) The situation of the withdrawal of troops; (3) The causes and circumstances of the incident, as well as the state of public order in Manchuria; (4) The fact that the Beining Road was bombed.</p>
<p>Mr. Fei's Talk Mr. Fei arrived at the Huangpu Wharf with his two daughters at 8:40 and boarded the ship to prepare to depart. When the reporter of the New Sound Agency asked him about his trip to Manchuria, he said that he had been to Liaoning once a few years ago. This is the second time. This trip to Liaoning is under the personal instruction of the Spanish Foreign Minister, Mr. Lele. After arriving in Liaoning, he will conduct an investigation in accordance with the instructions of the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to report. When reporting, he will only report to the Spanish Foreign Minister, and not to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Japanese Expression After Mr. Fei left Shanghai, the reporter went to the Shanghai office of the Japanese Minister to inquire about his opinion. It was expressed that the Japanese side did not oppose Mr. Fei's trip to Liaoning. This trip is under the order of the Spanish Foreign Minister. Japan does not oppose other countries going to Northeast China for investigation, except for those sent by the Chinese government as a result of its request to the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>Conversation with Mayor Zhang of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since three Japanese warships arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, rumors have been spreading. A reporter visited Mayor Zhang and asked him about the truth. Mayor Zhang</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>said, "On the day the unfortunate incident in Shenyang was reported to Shanghai, the Japanese Consul General in this port visited me and asked me to protect the Japanese residents. I replied that it is my responsibility to protect foreigners, but if Japanese soldiers cross into the Chinese-administered area and cause disputes, the Japanese side should be responsible. At that time, the Japanese Consul General also sincerely stated that he trusted the Municipal Government and that the Japanese soldiers would never take such action. For more than ten days, I have always ordered my subordinates to pay close attention to maintaining public order and protecting Japanese residents. Fortunately, there have been no accidents in the Chinese-administered area. The officer of the Japanese Marine Corps even sent a letter to Section Chief Huang of the Public Security Bureau today stating that there was absolutely no dispatch of sailors to land. Unexpectedly, there are rumors spreading in the city, even saying that there was gunfire in a certain place and that the Municipal Government had moved into the concession. The absurdity and lack of common sense are unimaginable. However, the citizens did not understand and occasionally moved away. Some schools mistakenly believed the rumors and announced a holiday, which was no different from self-disturbance. The Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters will absolutely be responsible for maintaining the public order of Shanghai. Chinese and foreign residents can rest assured. If anyone attempts to create rumors and cause trouble and disrupt public order, they will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the announcement jointly issued by the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Department the other day. I deeply hope that all sectors will remain calm, consider it with common sense, schools will continue to hold classes as usual, and industry and commerce will continue to work as usual. Do not lightly believe rumors to avoid falling into a trap."</p>
<h3>Four Japanese Warships Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Two Ships Stopped at the Mitsui Wharf 　　 One Ship Docked at No. 11 River Tube 　　 Another Ship Sailed to Gaochangmiao　　 Many More Ships Sailed into the Yangtze River Because the people of Japan are vigorously supporting the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement and the people's morale is high, Japan has taken the pretext of the tense situation in Shanghai to send a large number of warships to Shanghai from the Sasebo Naval Port to show force. The first to arrive were four ships of the 24th Fleet, which entered the port yesterday morning. The actions of each ship are reported as follows:　　 Four Ships Entered the Port Yesterday Morning The 24th Fleet of warships dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of the Navy, consisting of the destroyers "Hinoki", "Yanagi", "Momo", and "Kashi", commanded by Navy Lieutenant Commander Tanaka, set sail from Japan and arrived at Wusong on the night of the 5th. At 7:00 yesterday morning, these four ships sailed into Huangpu Port. After Tanaka held discussions with the Naval Commander stationed in Shanghai, the "Hinoki" and "Kashi" were ordered to stop at the Mitsui No. 2 Wharf, the "Momo" was docked at the No. 11 River Tube, and the "Yanagi" was ordered to sail directly to Nanshi and drop anchor near Gaochangmiao. It is said that these four ships are all second-class ships, with a total of more than 400 sailors and marines.　　 Residents Are Not Without Panic Since Japanese warships arrived in Shanghai yesterday, citizens along Baoshan Road have been moving their boxes and luggage to the concession area. Rickshaw pullers in Zhabei have tripled their business. Because Gaochangmiao in Nanshi is under de facto martial law, Nanyang Middle School announced a one-week suspension of classes starting yesterday.　　 Japanese Officials Visited the Public Security Bureau Yesterday afternoon, Shigeno Shibayama, the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps, sent his adjutant, Yoshishige Yasuda, with a letter to Huang Guangdou, the section chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The letter was signed by Yasuda and reads as follows: "Recently, it has been heard that there are many rumors in your country that the Marine Corps has occupied Zhabei, which has caused unrest in Zhabei. This is a completely baseless rumor and only serves to worsen the relationship between the two countries. I hope that you will investigate clearly and take measures to eliminate such rumors. October 6, Showa 6 (1931), Yasuda Yoshishige, Adjutant of the Shanghai Marine Corps, to Section Chief Huang."</p>
<p>Two Ships Prepared to Sail Upstream Yesterday, Tanaka and the commander of the Japanese First Overseas Detachment in Shanghai agreed to add the "Kashi" and "Hinoki" of the detachment to the Japanese fleet in the Yangtze River. Yesterday, an order was issued for the two ships "Hinoki" and "Kashi" to load food, water, and fuel in Shanghai, and then carry 100 marines and 150 sailors to Zhenjiang and Daye, so that the number of Japanese warships in the Yangtze River would be expanded to 22, and protect the production of the Daye Iron Mine, etc., in order to rush them to Japan.</p>
<p>Further Discussion on Increasing Ships in the Yangtze River In recent days, Japanese merchants have been present in various ports along the Yangtze River, from Chongqing in the upper reaches to Zhenjiang in the lower reaches, as well as in the provinces of Hunan and Hubei. Moreover, the rights occupied are enormous. Therefore, it is believed that the existing 22 warships are still not enough to show force. It has been decided to further discuss sending a large number of warships to China and adding them to the Yangtze River fleet. According to reliable sources obtained yesterday, it is planned to send one or two large cruisers and more than ten first-class destroyers, which are scheduled to depart for Shanghai within 24 to 48 hours. The naval corps carried by the special service ships will also come with them. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of the Navy has not only ordered the ships in Sasebo to prepare, but also ordered the ships in the Wu Naval Port to prepare to depart, and the fires have already been lit.</p>
<p>Investigation of Japanese Warships Coming to China According to the New Voice Agency,</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the number of Japanese warships invading China has reached as many as 30. According to an investigation by a reporter from the New Voice Agency, the ships assigned to the Yangtze River area are named the First Overseas Fleet, including (cruisers) Hirado, (gunboats) Hiei, Atami, Sumida, Saga, (flagship) Seta, Tsushima, (coastal defense ships) Katata, Hira, Hozu, Toba, Urakaze, Futami, etc., fourteen ships. There is also a river gunboat named Kotaka, totaling fifteen ships in the Yangtze River area. The ships assigned to North China, such as Tianjin and Qingdao, are named the Second Overseas Fleet, including (cruisers) Kiso, Fuyo, Asagao, etc., five ships. Those assigned to South China are the Third Overseas Fleet, stationed in Guangdong, Shantou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, etc., including six ships such as Uji. Together with the destroyers that arrived in Shanghai yesterday and today, Hinoki, Momo, Kashi, and Yanagi, there are a total of 31 ships.</p>
<h3>Heading to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Representative Petitioners Return to Shanghai: Compassionate Reply from Wang, Sun, Tang, Gu, et al.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association previously sent Hu Shuhua, Ye Huijun, Wang Hanliang, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, and five other representatives to Guangdong to petition for peaceful unity against foreign aggression. Except for representatives Lin and Wang, who could not accompany due to other matters, the remaining Hu and others, along with secretary Xue Guangqian and a party of four, departed from Shanghai on the 26th of last month. The representatives have now completed their petition and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning via the President Jackson passenger ship from Hong Kong. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Secretary Xue Guangqian yesterday to inquire about the petitioning process and the anti-Japanese movement in the area. Mr. Xue replied that he was ordered to go to Guangdong to petition, departing on September 26th. They arrived in Hong Kong after three days. When the ship was anchored in Kowloon, it was raining heavily. Considering the importance of their mission, they did not dare delay and ventured ashore in the rain, soaking their clothes. They stayed at the Queen's Hotel in Hong Kong. They read in the newspaper that representatives from Nanjing, Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, and Chen Mingshu, had arrived earlier. Guangdong also sent Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, and Li Wenfan as three representatives, who arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou at 6 p.m. on the 28th to negotiate. The two parties had already met at the Peninsula Hotel. Upon hearing this, they believed it was a good opportunity to present the opinions of the people while the two sides were discussing peace. Therefore, they rushed to the Peninsula Hotel without changing clothes to request an audience. However, as it was during the meeting, Secretary Zeng Zhongming came out to meet them. After relaying their opinions, Mr. Wang asked them to come for a talk at 5 p.m. At 5 p.m., they went as scheduled and were received by Mr. Wang Jingwei and Mr. Sun Zhesheng. They expressed the surging public sentiment in Shanghai after the Japanese army invaded and occupied the eastern provinces, the progress of the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, and the advantages and disadvantages of peaceful unification and unanimous resistance against Japan. Wang and Sun replied that at this critical moment for the nation's survival, only peaceful unification could turn danger into safety, and only solidarity could turn misfortune into blessing. Both Nanjing and Guangdong felt the urgent need to achieve this quickly. They had several discussions with the Nanjing representatives and the opinions were quite close, and the future was promising. They would invite the three representatives Cai, Chen, and Zhang to Guangzhou tomorrow morning (30th) for further consultations. In order to unite the people of Guangzhou to carry out the peace movement, they set off for Guangdong on the 30th. In addition to petitioning other dignitaries, they also engaged in effective propaganda. After arriving in Guangzhou, they successively visited Tang Shaochuan, Gu Yingfen, Sun Ke, Wang Jingwei, and other dignitaries. They also expressed the advantages and disadvantages of domestic unity and resistance against foreign aggression at this critical moment for the nation's survival. Tang and others were quite moved and replied very sincerely. The detailed process would be disclosed after a systematic report was prepared. However, the anti-Japanese situation in Hong Kong and Guangzhou was extremely enthusiastic. On September 29th, when they arrived in Hong Kong, they heard that Hong Kong had declared a special curfew. When they inquired about the reason, they were told that the Chinese people's boycott of Japanese goods was very serious and prevented any violent acts. In fact, the local Chinese people were very peaceful. However, the Japanese often changed into Chinese clothes and attacked the British, causing the British government to feel resentment towards the Chinese. When the person returned to Hong Kong from Guangzhou, the police at the Kowloon Railway Station searched very strictly. A British detective saw the black gauze of "Joining the National Crisis" on his arm and suspected him of causing trouble. After repeated arguments, he was sent to the police station for questioning for two hours. Fortunately, a friend of Mr. Hu Shuhua, Mr. Chen, spoke out righteously and argued with reason, and he was finally released. Mr. Xue said this with a sense of indignation. The anti-Japanese movement of Chinese businessmen in Hong Kong was also extremely enthusiastic. The methods were: (1) Merchants voluntarily did not buy or sell Japanese goods. Each shop posted red slogans "This shop does not sell Japanese goods" at the entrance. Any Japanese goods that had been imported, such as foreign cloth, foreign umbrellas, galoshes, handkerchiefs, etc., that could be destroyed were burned on the street. The sky was red, suspected of being a fire. Those that could not be destroyed, such as basins, porcelain, etc., were thrown into the alleys. (2) Coal ball workers, because Hong Kong stopped importing Japanese coal, their livelihoods were cut off, and now most of them changed their jobs to coolies. (3) Chinese employees working on Japanese ships resigned en masse. Coolies did not unload the goods, and Chinese people were not allowed to take Japanese ships, so the ships were greatly affected, with very few passengers and cargo. (4) More than 30 patients hospitalized in the Japanese-run Boai Hospital left the hospital one after another. Several Chinese people with very serious illnesses were also carried out on canvas beds, unwilling to die in Japanese hospitals. The Chinese male and female nurses serving in the hospital also resigned and left the hospital, causing the hospital to shut down. In Guangzhou, the anti-Japanese movement was not as organized as in Shanghai. Various sectors formed their own anti-Japanese groups, but the actual work was probably even more than in Shanghai. Inspection of Japanese goods had not yet begun, but most merchants could voluntarily boycott goods and posted "Japanese goods are not available" at the entrance. One shop had recently purchased several pieces of soda. Unexpectedly, two bombs were found at the door the next morning. The shopkeeper was very frightened and destroyed all Japanese goods in public, which shows the determination of the people of Guangzhou to boycott goods. The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce recently united with all sectors to hold a large parade to boycott goods. The whole city closed down for one day, and no less than 200,000 people participated. As for the students, the propaganda was the most powerful, led by Sun Yat-sen University. However, they did not stop classes. From 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. after class, they formed groups to give speeches. Many female students participated, mostly engaged in posting slogans and distributing leaflets. Some gave speeches in public and performed new patriotic dramas, with激揚and poignant tones, which made people sad and weeping.</p>

<h3>The Lindberghs Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Landed at Wusong at 5 p.m. Yesterday</p>
<p>Lindbergh Declines Public and Private Receptions Due to Father-in-Law's Death</p>
<p>American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife arrived outside Wusong yesterday afternoon on the British warship Hermes and then took a small British steamship into port, landing at Wusong at 5 p.m. The U.S. Consul General in Shanghai and his wife, and the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and his wife, were all at the riverbank to welcome them. After shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries, the Lindberghs traveled to Shanghai with the U.S. Consul General and his wife and stayed at the U.S. Consul General's residence. However, due to the recent death of Lindbergh's father-in-law, all public and private receptions in Shanghai were declined. Their future plans have not yet been determined. The British warship Hermes is scheduled to enter port this morning and dock near the Yangshupu Electric Plant on the river. Colonel Lindbergh was the first person to fly solo across the Atlantic. After his feat of flying directly from New York to Paris succeeded, the world regarded it as a new record of science conquering nature, and Lindbergh deserved to be called the Columbus of the 20th century. The Lindberghs flew to Nanjing on September 19th and witnessed the Yangtze River area in a vast expanse of water, with extremely severe disaster conditions. They immediately expressed to the National Government Disaster Relief Association their willingness to help. They flew to the Jiangbei area for several days to inspect and took photos of the disaster area for the Disaster Relief Association to use for relief. Their contribution to the disaster victims cannot be erased. After the Lindberghs completed the inspection of the Jiangbei disaster area, they began to fly to the Yangtze River area, first to Wuhu, then to Hankou.</p>
<h3>Recent Photo of the Lindberghs</h3>
<p>The Lindberghs were about to fly to the Dongting Lake area for inspection last Saturday morning when the river current was so rapid during takeoff that one wing of the plane hit the water and crashed. The Lindberghs jumped into the river one after another and were rescued by a lifeboat dispatched by the British aircraft carrier Hermes. The Lindberghs then brought the damaged plane to Shanghai for repair on the ship. It passed Nanjing at 2:15 p.m. the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 5 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lindbergh is the daughter of the former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Mr. Morrow, who is now a senator. He suddenly passed away in his sleep the day before yesterday at the age of 58. The Lindberghs had already received the radio report of the sad news on the ship. Mrs. Lindbergh's eyes were still red when she landed at Wusong yesterday, which shows her grief. The reporter of this newspaper met Colonel Lindbergh at the Songkou Riverbank yesterday. He said that in this situation, he did not want to express anything. The Lindberghs have arrived at the U.S. Consul General's residence and will not see guests for the time being to express their condolences. As for their damaged plane, the Army Department Aviation Administration is willing to donate a new motor and hopes to fly back to Nanjing as soon as possible. The Hongqiao Aircraft Factory in Shanghai and China Aviation Corporation are both willing to undertake the repair work.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Hearing of You Bolu Case</h3>
<p>Family Members of the Deceased Weep in Court</p>
<p>Representatives of the Labor Community Demand Severe Punishment</p>
<p>In the tragic case on Zishan Road in Zhabei, the Municipal Government transferred You Bolu to the court the day before yesterday. However, due to the need to sort out the confession documents, the transfer was delayed. It was not until 3 p.m. yesterday that the chief of the Municipal Government, accompanied by guards from the Public Security Bureau, transferred You Bolu and six patrolling police officers, Lin Qingxiang, Wu Maolin, Liu Weicheng, Qiao Xuechang, and Lin Zhanyou, to the District Court. At the same time, Xu Yan, the mother of the deceased Shen Wanlin, and Cai Shengtang, the father of Cai Bingquan, arrived with the local guarantor Yan Liugen. The preliminary hearing was opened by Prosecutor Yang Wenjun. The relatives of the deceased cried loudly in court, which was very sad. The judge repeatedly comforted them and ordered them to return first. Then he questioned You Bolu and the police officers and ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Labor Community Representative Assembly believes that You Bolu, the chief of the Fifth District Office of the Public Security Bureau, obstructed the patriotic movement and ordered the shooting and massacre of the people without authorization. It was resolved on the spot to send Lu Jingshi, Hou Dachun, Chen Peide, and eleven others to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government to petition for severe punishment. Yesterday, they also submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government, which stated: "We hereby petition that You Bolu, the chief of the Fifth District Office of the Public Security Bureau, ordered the shooting and massacre of innocent people. We implore you to quickly execute You on the spot, confiscate his property, and compensate the dead and injured to appease public anger and uphold national law. On the afternoon of the first day of this month, at about 6 p.m., soldiers of the Railway Armored Vehicle Team, motivated by patriotism, posted slogans in the Baoshan Road area. When they reached the police亭 at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Baoshan Road, Guo Wenhan, the police officer stationed at the police亭, forbade them to post and even insulted and beat them. The two sides twisted to the Fifth District Office. At that time, the people expressed their injustice and requested that the police officer be severely punished. At the same time, pedestrians stopped to watch, and the crowd grew larger and larger, and traffic was almost cut off. At that time, the Sixth District Party Headquarters also sent two committee members, Feng Xiancheng and Yang Youren, to the front of the Fifth District Office to explain the ins and outs and persuade the people in every possible way, so that they were about to disperse. Unexpectedly, You's animal nature broke out and he ordered the guards to open fire and shoot at the people, resulting in two deaths and five injuries. At that time, Feng and Yang were in the crowd, persuading them bitterly, and were very close to the place where the dead were. Fortunately, they survived the shooting. All the details of You's massacre have been reported on file. It is found that You is responsible for public security. At this time when the enemy is taking the opportunity to provoke and the country is in a difficult situation, he dares to lightly cause disturbances and act in a tyrannical manner. Judging from his crimes, he is not only the principal culprit in the massacre of the people, but also the chief culprit in destroying the party and the country. If the government does not impose the most severe punishment, it will not be enough to appease public anger and warn the treacherous and inferior. Therefore, the conference has solemnly decided (1) to request the Municipal Government to execute You Bolu on the spot to show the public, (2) to confiscate all of You Bolu's property, (3) to request the government to provide generous compensation to the injured and deceased, and (4) to request the Municipal Government to punish the Public Security Bureau Chief for ineffective supervision, etc., all on file. In addition to sending representatives Lu Jingshi, Hou Dachun, Chen Peide, etc. to present the case in person, and submitting it separately, we hereby urgently request your department (Ministry) to review, strictly implement, in order to show the party's faith, and uphold national law, we are extremely anxious to await orders, sincerely presented."</p>

<h3>Pu Wenting's Escape Theory</h3>
<p>Family Official Says Pu Absolutely Did Not Return Home</p>
<p>Pu Wenting, an important employee of the Wuxi Fuxin Flour Mill, was kidnapped by bandits on the 14th of last month when he came to Shanghai to congratulate Rong Zongjing, a large flour merchant, at the residence of a friend surnamed Wang at No. 19 Simingli, Fuxu Road, French Concession. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It has been three weeks, and there is no news from outside. A few days ago, it was slightly heard that the Public Concession Police had captured the principal offender in the case, but because the victim had not yet escaped, the police requested that the newspapers not disclose it temporarily for the convenience of investigation, so as to avoid danger to the victim. According to those close to the victim's family, the bandits had repeatedly sent letters demanding a price of up to one million yuan. The family could not cope with it. After repeated negotiations, it was heard that the result was to allow 400,000 yuan as the standard price. Among the bandits, it was said that the reason for kidnapping Pu was that since three years ago, someone had been following Pu all the time, and they all hated him for not having a chance to show off. Therefore, the capital that Pu had spent was already not small. Now that Pu had fallen into the shell, all the losses should be compensated by Pu. Unexpectedly, last night, the outside suddenly spread that Pu had escaped from the bandit's den on Kangdi Road, French Concession, alone. Upon hearing the news, the police immediately summoned the two women surnamed Wang at No. 19 Simingli and Pu Ziyongda to a special agency for questioning, but the family was still unaware. It is said that Pu has not yet returned home. Whether he has escaped is unknown. The reporter followed up everywhere, but there was no clue. However, one of those close to Pu's family said that the ransom price of 400,000 yuan had been agreed upon, so Pu's escape last night was probably not a fabrication. Some said that even if Pu escaped, he would never return to Simingli. At that time, he might directly return to Wuxi, or go to Rong's residence to rest temporarily, it is also unknown.</p>

Lawyer Wu immediately stated that lawyer Chen had not joined the Bar Association and, according to regulations, should not be able to practice law. Therefore, his appearance in court on behalf of a client was inappropriate and should be stopped. Chen replied that he had already joined the association. Wu said that he had investigated at the association an hour earlier and Chen was not a member. If Chen insisted on claiming to be a member, he should produce his membership certificate as proof. Chen then stated that if a certificate was required, it would take some time to produce it, and he would voluntarily retreat to the position of an ordinary agent. The judge did not initially make a ruling on Chen's eligibility to appear in court, presumably it would be determined after an investigation.</p>

<h3>Man and Woman Eloping Voluntarily</h3>
<h3>Although Bride Kidnapping Is Illegal</h3>
<h3>Why Must the Father Make Things Difficult?</h3>
<p>Wang Jinyu, a native of Shandong residing at a certain address on Edinburgh Road, had a daughter named Xiuying, around twenty years old with a pleasing appearance. In the 17th year of the Republic [1928], she was betrothed through a matchmaker to Lu Caifa, a native of Changzhou. Recently, due to Lu's financial difficulties and inability to formally marry her, the daughter's parents considered marrying Xiuying to another man, but their daughter did not agree. Upon hearing this, Lu became anxious and, on the morning of the 23rd of last month at 6:10 a.m., invited his friends Wang Sanda and Dong Xiting, also from Changzhou, and hired a car to wait near the girl's home. When Xiuying passed by on her way to work at a rubber shoe factory, Lu stepped forward and carried her into the car, which drove to the North Railway Station. They boarded a train back to Changzhou and cohabited at his home. This act is commonly known as bride kidnapping. Subsequently, Xiuying's father, Wang Jinyu, reported the incident to the Huishan Police Department. Chinese detective Zhao Ruisheng arrested Wang Sanda and handed him over to the First Special District Court for investigation. Later, the police learned that Lu Caifa and Wang Xiuying had come to Shanghai on the 28th of last month and were hiding in the Yuanyuan Hotel at No. 9 Caishi Street in the French Concession. The police chief sent Chinese and Western detectives to arrest them, but they could not be found. Knowing that it would be difficult to hide for long, Lu Caifa went with Wang Xiuying to lawyer Yuan Yang'an's office the day before yesterday to seek help. Lawyer Yuan, noting that a public prosecution had already been filed, advised them to surrender to the Huishan Police Department, while Xiuying returned home alone. The police then apprehended her friend Dong Xiting. Yesterday morning, he and Wang Sanda were brought to the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police department presented the case, stating that Wang Xiuying's age was uncertain, whether she was twenty or nineteen years old, and requested the court to inquire. Wang Xiuying stated that she was actually twenty years old, born on the fourth day of the third month, in the year of the Rat. She was betrothed to Lu Caifa at the age of seventeen, and Lu had visited her home several times. That morning, he hired a car and carried her into it. A certain neighbor woman saw this and told her parents that she had gone with Lu. This was done with her consent. Later, they took a train to Lu's home in Changzhou and lived with his sister and others. The girl's father, Wang Jinyu, requested the court to punish Lu Caifa for this uncivilized and impolite act. Upon hearing this, his daughter approached her father and pleaded on behalf of her husband, asking to spare him punishment, but her father refused. Wang Sanda and Dong Xiting both stated that Lu had asked them to help and pleaded for leniency for Lu Caifa, confirming that the act was done with Xiuying's consent, but they had not yet formally married. Judge Shen Bingrong asked Lu, "Do you know that you have committed a crime?" Lu replied, "I know I have committed a crime, please be lenient." Judge Shen advised Wang Jinyu that it would be easy for him to punish Lu Caifa, but he would ultimately be his son-in-law, and his daughter had gone willingly. If he could be flexible, he should have Lu apologize in court. Wang still requested punishment. When Wang Xiuying was questioned, she said, "If you punish Lu, then punish me too, please be lenient." Lu's lawyer, Yuan Yang'an, defended him. The court then ordered the three defendants to be detained pending sentencing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Wan Zhenbao Withdraws Investigation</h3>
<h3>Zhao Zhuochen Also Does Not Pursue the Matter</h3>
<p>Wan Zhenbao, a woman from Jiaxing, hired lawyer Xu Bingcheng to sue Zhao Zhuochen, a Guangdong native residing on Bazilu, in the Special District Court for having illicit relations with a young girl and causing harm to her health. It is now learned that this case has been voluntarily withdrawn from the court by the plaintiff's representative, lawyer Xu Bingcheng, and an apology has been published in the newspaper. According to a person familiar with the case, Wan Zhenbao, also known as Wan Zhenguan, came to Shanghai from Jiaxing with her mother, Wan Gao, in the first month of the lunar calendar this year and entered a brothel set up by a Mr. Yang on Xiamen Road as a private prostitute. She changed her name to Yang Caifeng and solicited customers at the Xian Shi Amusement Park and other places every evening. She soon became involved with a patron named Zhang and agreed to be his concubine, receiving 1,300 silver dollars for her body. However, when Zhang's savings of more than 2,000 yuan were exhausted, Wan Zhenbao pretended to have important matters to attend to back in Jiaxing. Meanwhile, her mother asked Messrs. Xu, Shen, and Zhou to introduce her to Zhao Zhuochen as a concubine. Wan Zhenbao and her mother, Fan Gao, received gifts and wrote a marriage contract on the spot. This happened on June 4th. On August 20th, the Wan Zhenbao and her mother secretly escaped, leaving a letter from lawyer Xu Bingcheng. Zhao Zhuochen, seeing that his concubine had absconded with everything, did not pursue the matter. However, Wan's representative, lawyer Xu Bingcheng, then sent a letter to the Zhao family, making various demands. When the Zhao family ignored these demands, they filed a lawsuit in court. Unexpectedly, on the 4th of this month, Wan Zhenbao went to the Yipinxiang Hotel for some business and was recognized by Mr. Yang, who ran the brothel, and her patron, Mr. Zhang. They intervened and proved to the Zhao family that Wan Zhenbao was a "wild chicken" prostitute who specialized in defrauding men. Wan Zhenbao realized that the situation was dire and that she might be counter-sued if she went to court with the Zhao family. Therefore, she asked her representative, lawyer Xu Bingcheng, to seek peace with the Zhao family and voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit against Zhao. The Zhao family, being magnanimous, has agreed not to pursue the matter.</p>

<h3>Stranded Personnel Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Over Two Thousand People Will Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<h3>Office Set Up at the Qu Zhenren Temple</h3>
<p>After Japan's military occupation of Northeast China, the Shenyang Arsenal was seized, and the Beida Camp was burned. Day after day, the He Xing and other steamships have arrived in Shanghai carrying stranded personnel from the arsenal. The number has already reached over two thousand one hundred people. To make a living, they have organized the Stranded Personnel Group of the Northeast China Arsenal, preparing to petition in Nanjing. The various details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Setting Up an Office</h3>
<p>The Fengtian Arsenal has a bullet department, a gun department, a shell department, a ammunition factory, a machine gun department, and a machine department, with over 10,000 workers in total. Since the violent Japanese occupation of Northeast China, day after day, people have been arriving in Shanghai from Yingkou aboard the Zhao Xing Company's He Xing, Yu Xing, and Lian Xing steamships. As of yesterday, there were over two thousand one hundred people. Their livelihood is a real concern and those who have no homes are temporarily living at the Qu Zhenren Temple in Gaochangmiao. To make a living, they have organized the Stranded Personnel Group of the Northeast China Arsenal. They began registration yesterday, and will hold a meeting of all the stranded personnel at 9 a.m. on the 10th to discuss livelihood issues. They have appointed Xiao Guichun, Song Yuqing, Dai Xiuqi, Peng Liang, and others to work at the office set up at the Qu Zhenren Temple, preparing to go to Nanjing to request the National Government to maintain the livelihood of the stranded personnel, and to request Deputy Commander Zhang to pay the two months of back wages owed to them while they were employed.</p>
<h3>Details of the Stranding</h3>
<p>According to members of the group, they spoke to a Xin Sheng reporter about the details of their stranding, saying that around 11 p.m. on September 18th, they suddenly heard the sound of gunfire. Merchants and civilians awoke in shock, crying out in fear and panic. The gunfire subsided temporarily at dawn and the Japanese army occupied all areas. Police and detectives removed their uniforms and weapons. It is estimated that over five hundred soldiers from the Beida Camp were killed, and the number of injured is unknown. One hundred thirty-five civilians were killed and eighty-seven were injured. Corpses lay strewn everywhere. On the 19th, a Japanese major led his troops to occupy the arsenal and the aviation office. At that time, the factory gates were closed, so they used ladders to climb over the walls and erected Japanese flags everywhere. Although the employees were not in the factory, twelve were killed and nine injured. Forty-two airplanes were taken away. Those that could not be used were burned with coal. At night, they secretly transported the guns, ammunition, and 78,000 rifles from the factory. Four hundred million rounds of ammunition. On the 20th, they destroyed the Beida Camp and various other agencies. That night, employees of the electric light plant fled and Shenyang became dark. This tragic scene makes one want to cry in grief. On the 21st, the Kwantung Army Commander Honjo issued a notice to reassure the people. The wording was absurd and unreasonable. On the 22nd, they burned the mortar factory and incited Koreans to loot. On the 23rd, tens of thousands of refugees fled from Huanggu Village by train every day. Tianjin has a maintenance society that helps them survive. On the 24th, Changchun and Yingkou also suffered losses, but they were lighter than those in Shenyang. On the 25th, rumors and panic spread. We fled from Shenyang to Yingkou by South Manchuria Railway, costing two yuan and eight jiao in gold tickets, equivalent to seven yuan in Chinese currency. Only individuals were allowed to travel. We pawned our clothes and took the steamship to Shanghai. There are still thousands of workers stranded in Shenyang due to lack of money for transportation. Yesterday, we received a telegram from Fengtian informing us that the Chinese police have been re-armed, but the chief of police is Japanese and a Japanese flag is displayed.</p>

<h3>Needs to Enter Dock for Major Repairs After Being Pulled Out</h3>
<h3>Ran Aground Midway</h3>
<p>The Dalian Steamship Company's Ryufuku Maru, carrying a large shipment of coal from Fushun to Hankou, passed Shanghai on the 2nd of this month. At 5 a.m. on the night of the 4th, the ship was sailing about 19 nautical miles upstream from Nanjing. The river surface was wide at that point, and the navigation route was difficult to discern.

<h3>Survey of the Siltation of the Puhuitang River</h3>
<p>The Puhuitang River in western Shanghai borders the three municipalities of Shanghai, Songjiang, and Qingpu. Due to increasing siltation, it is proposed to dredge the river. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has ordered Sun Shengzeng, director of the Songjiang and Shanghai Construction Bureau, and Zhang Qitai, director of the Qingpu Construction Bureau, to conduct a joint survey. They have already submitted a report. The Construction Department immediately forwarded it to the Provincial Government, which has requested the Shanghai Municipal Government to handle the matter. The director and others are consulting with the Municipal Government to discuss the handling of the matter. The following is an excerpt from the report submitted by the director and others: "The Puhuitang River runs east from the Panlong Bridge, through Qibao Town, to the Jiepai Bridge, a distance of about twelve li, within the borders of Songjiang and Qingpu counties. East of the Jiepai Bridge, to the section entering the Huangpu River, is in the Shanghai urban area. The width of the river varies, from over five zhang in the wider areas to no more than twenty chi in the narrower areas. Currently, during the flood season, the river is about one zhang deep in the deeper areas and about three chi deep in the shallower areas. It is expected that the riverbed will be shallow and dry during the dry season. The river receives water from the Panlong Pond, Sijing Pond, and Hengliu River in the west and flows east to the Huangpu River. It is a shortcut for boats traveling to and from Zhujiajiao, Qingpu, Songjiang, Sijing, Qibao, Hongqiao, Xujiahui, and other towns. The farmland to the north and south of the river relies on it for irrigation, and the residents rely on it for drinking water. However, due to the influx of tidal water from the Huangpu River, silt and sediment accumulate easily, leading to siltation. According to past practices, the three municipalities of Shanghai, Songjiang, and Qingpu were responsible for dredging the river in sections every five years. The Shanghai section runs east from the Huangpu River's Rihui Port to the Jiepai Bridge on the border with Qingpu. The Qingpu section runs west from the Jiepai Bridge, through Qibao Town, to the Beixiaoyuan Port. Since the dredging carried out during the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, more than twenty years have passed. The previous dredging efforts lacked a concrete plan, so the river silted up as it was dredged, leading to the current situation. For the sake of the people's drinking water, boat transportation, and farmland irrigation, the Shanghai Municipal Government should be consulted to develop a comprehensive plan to dredge the river as soon as possible to benefit the people."</p>

<h3>Mr. Ni Caizhi's Message</h3>
<p>(Please publish the Tanaka's policy of aggression against Manchuria and Mongolia in the newspaper.)</p>
<p>I once asked your newspaper to publish the book "Tanaka's Aggressive Policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia." If this book is published in your newspaper and widely publicized, the people of the country will be more aware of the seriousness of Japan's aggression against our country. (Reply) "Tanaka's Aggressive Policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia" was first published in the November issue of the "Current Affairs Monthly" in the 18th year of the Republic of China. Since then, it has been repeatedly printed into special volumes, either added to or sold. Our newspaper has too many important news items and other documents piled up, so it will not be reprinted.</p>

<h3>Book and Newspaper Reviews</h3>
<p>"A History of Japanese Imperialist Aggression Against China" by Zhu Qin and Jiang Jianren</p>
<p>Bringing up this book now seems a bit opportunistic, but so be it, when things get to a head, even a last-minute effort is worthwhile.</p>
<p>When someone who knows how to fight comes at you, they will naturally have a careful observation first, attacking you on the upper, middle, and lower levels. If you also know how to fight, then you must be careful where your opponent is attacking from; otherwise, even if you are killed, you won't know where you were hit. When a strong country wants to invade a weak country, they also have a detailed plan in advance, using your weaknesses to carry out their aggressive policies. Japan, the wolf of Asia, driven by ambition and pressured by its own overpopulation, constantly invades China. Therefore, their methods, policies, and steps of aggression are worth studying. This book provides us with a lot of detailed material.</p>
<p>Part One: The Reasons, Policies, Methods, and Periods of Aggression Against China.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Reasons: (1) Overpopulation, (2) Lack of Food, (3) Occupation of Commodity Markets, (4) Seizure of Raw Material Supply Areas, (5) Investment of Surplus Capital. Chapter 2: Policies: Describing Continental Advancement, Marine Advancement, Hardline, and Flexible Policies. Chapter 3: Methods: Divided into Military, Political, Economic, and Cultural Methods. Chapter 4: Periods: (1) Experimental Period: From the Meiji Restoration in Japan in 1867 to the Sino-Japanese War in 1893, (2) Budding Period: From the Sino-Japanese War in 1894 to the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, (3) Active Period: From the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 to World War I in 1914, (4) Rampant Period: From World War I in 1914 to the Present.</p>
<p>Part Two: The Facts of Aggression Against China in the Past Sixty Years.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: From Sino-Japanese Trade to the Sino-Japanese War: Detailing the first dispatch of envoys to the court and the introduction of culture and Buddhism to Japan, all the way to the scourge of the Wokou pirates, preliminary aggression against Korea, and pretext for attacking Taiwan. Chapter 6: From the Sino-Japanese War to the Russo-Japanese War: Detailing the course of the Sino-Japanese War, the loss of Taiwan, the signing of the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, the entry of the Eight-Nation Alliance into Beijing, and the formation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Chapter 7: From the Russo-Japanese War to World War I: Detailing the Russo-Japanese War and the relationship between China and Japan, Japan's annexation of Korea, and the aggression against Manchuria and Mongolia, as well as the occurrence of various disputes. Chapter 8: From World War I to the Present: This chapter has detailed records of the attack on Qingdao, the occupation of Shandong, and the occurrence of various massacres, as well as loan agreements.</p>
<p>Part Three: The Total Statistics of the Achievements of Aggression Against China in the Past Sixty Years.</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Achievements of Territorial Aggression: A systematic description of ceded territories, leased territories, treaty ports, spheres of influence, etc., the history, situation, number of households, and population of lost lands. Chapter 10: Achievements of Military Aggression: Describing the Japanese naval and land forces stationed in China, the Japanese police, the statistics of unprecedented massacres in history, and the Japanese fortresses in Manchuria. Chapter 11: Achievements of Political Aggression: Describing Japan's unequal conditions against China, consular jurisdiction, inland navigation rights, etc. Chapter 12: Achievements of Economic Aggression: Describing Japan's aggression in China regarding railways, navigation, telecommunications, forests, fisheries, mining, industry, trade, banking, loans, etc. Chapter 13: Achievements of Cultural Aggression: Describing the schools established and newspapers and news agencies founded by Japan in China. Chapter 14: Newly Implemented Aggressive Policies: Describing Japan's Manchurian Railway silk policy, large-scale colonization, and cunning policies such as the migration of Japanese and Korean people to Manchuria.</p>
<p>The good thing about this book is that it systematically describes Japan's imperialist policies and actions of aggression against China, exposing Japan's ambitions nakedly.</p>

<h3>Grief</h3>
<p>— Li Guangzheng</p>
<p>It's over, friends!</p>
<p>Our beautiful land is lost from this moment. The blood of our compatriots flows like water. The iron hooves of imperialism have shattered Manchuria. The sun flag is planted all over the cities and towns of the Northeast. Hundreds of cannons are opening their bloody mouths. Fierce bayonets, countless heads, the Pacific Ocean boils and roars in anger. Five thousand years of great China, immediately unable to survive. What is calmness? What is humiliation? Watching our compatriots being trampled, violated, and slaughtered by the enemy. Then you start to act. The past glory of Belgium, is the reward obtained by non-resistance? They exhausted their iron and blood for a place of justice and light, fighting for peace. Oh, good men of China, the urgent war drums are urging, how can you linger? Quickly wave your sharp swords, mount your brave steeds, avenge our country, relieve the sorrows of our compatriots. Let us all arm ourselves and unanimously head to Fusang [Japan]. Go, go, classmates, we have iron blood and heads. The key to the death of our country, the border has already been breached, in an instant, you will have nowhere to be buried. Female compatriots, quickly rise up to resist. Women also have boiling blood and great heads.</p>
<p>We can propagandize and agitate, we can rescue and transport, even if we can only do a little bit of strength, we are willing to be ghosts who died in battle, rather than slaves of a conquered nation.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, the enemy's sharp knives are flashing on our necks, and international sympathy has disappointed us. Drunken and dreaming compatriots, when will you rise up together? We must work together to kill the enemy, willing to use our blood and heads to fill Fusang. Strive for self-improvement, restore our beautiful homeland.</p>
<h3>Revenge</h3>
<p>— Yan Wen</p>
<p>I came to school in the morning. My mother told us to go home early because my father was leaving in the next two days. My mother prepared to cook something for my father's trip, so she made the Mid-Autumn Festival early. My mother also told me that she specially killed a chicken for me, the half-year-old mottled chicken… As for me, I only cared about how to get through this morning. As long as I got through this morning, I could go home and eat the braised chicken. But how could I get through this morning? Mr. Mo had told us a long time ago that we would have an arithmetic test today, and the first class was arithmetic, but I still couldn't do double-digit multiplication. What should I do? I thought to myself, run away! But I couldn't do that. If my mother found out, she would definitely punish me like before.</p>
<p>I went to school with a stiff head. The bell at the school gate had already rung past eight o'clock. I was late again and would be scolded by the teacher. I hurriedly ran to the classroom door, taking three steps at a time. The strangest thing was that there was no test. Every student was standing and there was no sound. Mr. Mo was also standing, facing the portrait of the Prime Minister and the national flag hanging on the blackboard. I tiptoed and sneaked to my seat like a thief. Fortunately, Mr. Mo didn't notice me.</p>
<p>The situation was really special. The classroom was as quiet as if someone had died. Even the "tick-tock, tick-tock" sound of the big grandfather clock hanging in the academic affairs office could be heard very clearly. I carefully peeked at the students next to me, who were all standing at attention with their hands down and their heads bowed. Even Chen Faxiang, who was usually the most naughty and often made funny faces to make people laugh, was standing just as obediently.</p>
<p>As I was wondering what was going on, Mr. Mo turned around and told everyone to sit down. I didn't even raise my head to look at him, for fear that he would notice I was late.</p>
<p>"Children, let me tell you something very painful!"</p>
<p>Mr. Mo's voice was very trembling and sad, which made me have to raise my head to look at him. I then noticed his eye sockets were very red, and two clear tears were gradually flowing down from the corners of his eyes, running down his cheeks.</p>
<p>"Yesterday, Japanese soldiers occupied our Northeast. They killed our officers, burned our military factories, and seized our airplanes. Children, what a disgrace! Look, another piece of the autumn begonia leaf has been eaten away by others!" Mr. Mo pointed to the map of China hanging on the wall. Everyone's eyes were focused on that place, as if the three eastern provinces, painted in red and blue, were covered with flags with a sun in the middle, and under the flags was covered with blood, the blood of Chinese people…</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. Occasionally, their eyes met, but they immediately looked away and continued to look at Mr. Mo's sad face.</p>
<p>"Children, the country is ours. The shame of the country is also our shame. If there is no country,</p>
