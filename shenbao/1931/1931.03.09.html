<h3>追記孫美松受撫事</h3>
<p>— 天健</p>
<p>閱近日本報新聞。抱犢崗之匪氛又以復熾聞矣。該匪首領孫美松及其匪黨在去年當戰事緊張之時。曾一度受當局收撫。編爲第二十七師。孫任爲師長。即以景泰名行。爾時當局派往點騐之者。即爲余友曹君。曹任總部參謀職。嘗爲余道往匪窟點騐時之情狀。間與戲劇中所演江湖大盜之行動無異。頗多趣也、當曹君受命赴匪窟時偕行之人不多。均跨馬往。非窟在重山峻嶺中。地適在臨郯費　嶧五縣交界處。叢莽密箐。仄徑隠約。不易探搜。匪境之外爲紅槍會所踞。紅槍會所踞之境外。爲民團所守之境。爾時民團紅槍會與匪互相鉗制。故在形式上儼然劃疆而守。曹君一行人入匪窟之先。受驚頗多。其始受民團之槍擊。經說明而過。次受紅槍會槍擊、雖經解釋。則較民團略難。其終乃抵匪境。而匪似己有預備。便見叢林中有人影三三兩兩。往來其間。一如窺探狀見曹等至。即躍出詢姓名來去。比語以來由、即揮帽作禮。導入一堡。堡之外平疇廣原。間植樹竹。風景甚佳。其時堡前聚匪頗多。槍聲突然四起。匪言此最敬禮也。旣至。羣匪忽皆揮帽作禮。厥狀奇趣。去騎入内。宅甚深廣。及一門。即有數十匪揮帽。至四五門。乃見十餘人簇擁一人立於階前。曹知其人定爲孫也。相見甚恭。敬茶烟時。紙烟每客必兩枝。此亦異於常禮者。及設餚聚餐。匪中人頗多踞椅而食。蓋匪中日常必行之禮、坐食反爲失禮、亦奇聞也。孫於酒次笑謂曹曰。吾道中規矩。恐多不合外界禮節君得母見而訝異乎。曹含糊答之而己。曹君居山中凡數日。飲食起居雖尚適。而槍聲則無時或斷。窟中最忌雙手反負。蓋以爲大不祥者。曾幾何時。而孫等忽又爲匪。吁。白雲蒼狗。變化乃如此耶。</p>

<p>澳洲爲養鴨事業集中之處。據墨爾鉢（新金山）傳來消息。謂最近澳大利亞與新西蘭。舉行鴨子産卵比賽。優勝者爲一一年生之鴨。該鴨在二百二十天中。産卵二百二十五枚。造成産卵之新紀錄、主人爲克拉克氏。住於蒙寗頓地方。據其所言。此鴨在二百二十天中。亦有全日不産卵之時。惟一天中。産卵二枚或三枚者。亦有多日。故能造成新紀錄云。</p>
<h3>男性模特兒</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>「模特兒」有許多不同的解釋。最普通的有兩種。一種是專供藝術家作寫生的對象。一種是在衣裝店裏穿上衣服給人家看樣的人。這兩種本是女性的專業。所以我們一看到模特兒三個字。常會聨想到女人的一切。然而在實際上。模特兒本是model的譯音。意義與中文云「模型」相等。供藝術家寫生之用者。非但女子可以。就是男子和其他各種動物亦何嘗不可。不過男性而在衣裝店中充模特兒者。却是一九三一年巴黎的新事業之一。</p>
<p>歐美各國的女子職業很發達。飲食店中用女招待。百貨公司中雇女店員。眞是希鬆平常之至。據最近的調查。英國各地現有的女職員（僅指商店而言）總數爲三百四十七萬四千一百七十人。與一九二三年相較。超過了五十萬人。同時男子們的地位。就日形蹙小。而各種新工業之發起者。又多注重於女職員。以男職員爲例外。男子們在社會上己漸漸的失去了重要。一般失業的男子。没法可想。於是不得不另闢蹊徑。凡是摩登女性所不願爲者。男子們就取而代之。歷來認爲女子之天職的「家政。」在最近各繁盛都市中。多己由男子代勞。巴黎却更有男性摸特兒之出現。在各著名衣裝店裏。試新裝。作媚態。以餉主顧。亦是一九三一年奇事之一。</p>
<h3>紀兩件值得嘉許的事</h3>
<p>— 陳元良</p>
<p>本月一日。酩酊聚餐會假座悅賓樓開創立會。愚準時挈侣參加。時己羣賢畢至。握手道故後。一時譁談頓寂。祇聞咀嚼之聲。酒未兩巡。而飤餚罄矣。繼以　戰。寂寞空氣又爲之一破。無何杯盤狼藉。乃相與離座。斥資償餐費焉。時有東海生者。除付例資外。復益以二羊。并謂此財來自意外。特捐於會。犒賞侍役。爲吾會成立之點綴云云。衆聞言相顧愕然。蓋不知究竟也。生乃起立。稱彼現供職於河南路某銀行今午至對門之小烟紙店中購香烟。出小銀元二。得烟一合而返。未數步而該店之學徒狂呼之返。授以番佛二尊。曰此先生所遺也。謹以奉還。彼甚驚異。因購烟時初未探及大洋。僅付小銀元而己。乃弗受。告之以故。學徒復曰。此欵非此時所遺。乃上次所遺。留以待君也。彼力辯其無。而學徒堅以爲是。終以不願多費唇舌。反起路人疑竇。乃强受而謝之。想此店或有身材狀貌與渠彷彿之顧客。遺欵而去。致使學徒誤認矣。似此纖芥無私。實足欽佩。故爲宣布於衆。又以其財非我屬故樂爲捐助耳。愚旣聆言畢。亦憶及某日之夕。雇街車返寓。及抵弄口。付資一躍而下。竟忘置新購之西裝硬領半打於車中。乃車夫呼愚返。告愚以故。愚鑒其誠。再給以資。彼時以爲區區之領。值數未多。一經失而復得。轉視如珍寳矣。當愚廻眸之際。則紙包安放車中。車夫初不審其爲何物。足知其此舉。純出眞誠。初未以物之重輕爲標準也。爰繼東海生續爲宣佈於衆。衆皆正色。對此學徒車夫。深致景仰。僉稱爲近世中之佼佼者焉。</p>
<h3>說書雜譚</h3>
<p>— 心危</p>
<p>上海自東方旅社設立書塲以來。長樂等聽客在减。匯泉樓尚能維持其原來營業。東方則最爲發達。遠東自去冬即改說書化裝戲。頗爲一般婦女所樂聞。以詞句淺顯。調近於東鄉。腔等於蘇州之說因果也。</p>
<p>評話家以黄兆麟之三國。最有骨子。其獻馬贈袍五關斬將。己成絶唱。起關公狀曹操。實無出其右。而且爲後起者所不能效學。扮相得乃父永年之嫡傳。而說白三到。檯規又謹守。其克享盛名。實非易易。</p>
<p>兆熊爲兆麟之弟。唱彈詞落金扇。尤所擅塲。曾習崑曲六年。故於字面上十分用功。咬字旣準。發音又清。絶無花腔油調。與徒博悅耳有音無字者。正不可同日而語。在彈詞中允推第一·</p>
<p>珠塔一書自馬如飛而後。現時當推魏鈺卿。魏之細膩功夫。己無人能及。唱篇亦純爲馬調。惜中氣欠足。然而即此調門。己無人能及。但以時代潮流變遷。魏書固絶頂。而聽衆之程度。今非昔比。知音日少。可慨也。</p>
<p>薛小卿沈健安。一爲魏傳。一係朱兼莊之高足。二人之書如何。不佞不敢恭維。亦不敢妄貶。依道中（即同業中人）言。沈薛之珠塔。爲老光珠。不若鍾筱儂之珠塔。較爲新光也。</p>
<p>朱蘭菴朱菊安之西廂。固是獨擅勝塲。與李伯康之楊乃武。同爲只此一家。並無分出。而享有專利權者。二朱之名。在彈詞界轉不若李之紅。蓋伯康之書。詞句中甚多新名詞。而頗覺運用得法也。</p>
<p>楊筱亭之白蛇傳。得乃子愼麟之助。益形佳妙。筱亭說白好。書又熱。愼麟則唱調佳。敲金戞至。令人聞而怡悅。</p>
<p>三笑自謝品泉被暗殺。後當推夏蓮生爲個中巨擘。蔣賓初王宛香等。亦可對付過去。</p>
<p>葉聲翔之金台傳。可稱己到爐火純靑之候。聲翔精拳擊。能在書台上發幾路拳棒。因金台傳中多打擂之事。非知武術者不能生色。聲翔旣諳技擊。更善評說。樂而不俗。光裕社中短靠書。居第一流。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三七八）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>因此大肚皮阿金對於花老六。雖覺得這篇文章的起勢不大得勁。却希望伊的好文章還在後面。可是伊的花運眞不大佳。一個月漸漸的過去了。生意並不十分起色。固然是伊的運氣不好。但是在伊的脾氣上。也很受了一個影響。因爲伊能率性徑行年輕女子的本能。對於年靑的客人。歡迎一點兒。對於四十歲以外的客人。雖然也極力的敷衍。却是在不知不覺間。露出一些淡漠的情狀。一樣兩位客人。到伊那裏去開盤子。年靑的客人那邊。便多坐一嚮兒。出條子到了檯面上。遇到了年靑的客人。便有說有笑。對於招呼伊的啞而蠻。伊就只有尊敬的態度。不大說話。北方人最是鬧醋勁的。看在眼裏。早己不高興伊了。常常說伊歡喜小白臉。那倒也不去、管它。這時候北京政府正在漸次繁盛之際。各省的軍閥。川流不息。在外省刮了民脂民膏。或者在財政部裏領到了餉糈。都在北京揮霍浪用。還有那班議員老爺。是各省舉出的國民代表。他們也是狂嫖濫賭。酒地花天。其次什麽總長次長。苞苴所入。也可以儘量的報效。雖然腐化到了極點。但是那班窰姐兒。却極端歡迎這班寃大頭。尤其是嫖客而兼賭客的。因爲有種人。在平日用錢是有一個範圍。一到了賭塲。就漫無限止了。那班姑娘。更希望招呼自己的客人。要灜了錢。那便是運氣來了。譬如那個客人。一下子就贏了兩三萬。當塲就給他自己姑娘三千五千的現金或是支票。帶了就走。不算什麽一回事。這種賭局。大半在北京城内的東城西城幾處闊公館裏。他們胡同裏稱之爲出城裏條子。姑娘們聽到了出城裏條子。就眉飛色舞。可知今天晚上。倘然有一塲賭。那就有個大希望了。所以把今晚上胡同裏的城外條子。一概謝絶。條子打回来。說是某某姑娘出城裏條子去了。也像是喊得響亮。很有光榮的一般。有的還雇了汽車進城。這汽車錢也由主人家打發。倘然是主人家贏了。或是頭錢有得多餘。分給姑娘們兩百三百塊錢。也是有的。花老六到了北京來以後。就想遇着這們一個主顧。直到了一個月以後有一位局長。招呼了伊。很和伊要好。便道老六。過了幾天。我家裏要請客。約幾個朋友來賭錢。我可以給你抽一塲頭。花老六聽了。當然很高興。</p>

<p>Japanese Budget Subcommittee</p>
<h3>Matsuda Minister of Colonial Affairs Embarrassed</h3>
<p>Quarreling with Director-General Kodama</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th: Yesterday, the sixth subcommittee of the House of Peers budget meeting was held. During the meeting, Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda, in response to Ōkuma’s (Tuesday) question regarding the relocation of the Chungcheongnam-do provincial office, stated that in order to respect the House of Representatives' rejection of the relocation expenses and in view of the recent trends in Korean thought, he did not wish for its reinstatement. However, the succeeding Director-General of Political Affairs, Kodama, stated that the Governor-General's Office hoped that the House of Peers would reinstate the provincial office relocation expenses. This caused a disagreement between Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda and Director-General Kodama, leading to fierce attacks from the committee members. Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda was sweating profusely and, unable to withstand the attacks, fled the committee meeting to the rest room. Director-General Kodama followed him, and the minister angrily scolded, "You idiot!" Director-General Kodama left in silence. It is predicted that the director-general's resignation is not far off.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Fire in London</h3>
<p>Tower Bridge Warehouse Reduced to Ashes</p>
<p>Wind Intensifies Fire, Difficult to Extinguish</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 7th: A fire broke out this morning in a seven-story warehouse at London's Tower Bridge. The scale of the fire is rarely seen in recent London history. Seventy fire engines and 1,100 firefighters arrived from various locations to fight the fire, but the strong easterly wind caused the flames to rage fiercely, and the smoke was so thick that it could be seen from seven miles away. Although firefighters risked their lives to fight the fire, they were unable to save the warehouse, and a large quantity of tea and rubber was reduced to ashes. Another report states that the Tower Bridge warehouse has been burning for five hours and is still not extinguished, but the fire brigade has now gained control. Although the inside is extremely hot, the water sprayed by the fire engines freezes into icicles as it runs down the walls.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the Italian-French Naval Agreement</h3>
<p>Heads of State of Both Countries Expected to Exchange Visits</p>
<p>To Further Resolve Political Issues</p>
<p>Details of the Agreement Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>The Kokumin-sha, Rome, 7th: It has recently been rumored that after the conclusion of the Franco-Italian naval agreement, there will be naval exchanges between the two countries. Italy will send a fleet to visit the French naval port of Toulon, and the French fleet will visit the Italian port of La Spezia. However, these rumors have not been confirmed by official sources. Furthermore, it is said that the two governments are planning mutual visits between the heads of state, with the King of Italy visiting the President of France in Paris, and the President of France returning the visit to the King of Italy in Rome. Whether other important political issues will be discussed after the naval agreement when the heads of state visit each other is what political circles and the public are eager to know. ▲ Reuters, Paris, 7th: French Foreign Minister Briand stated to cabinet members that, for reasons of international policy, the details of the Franco-Italian naval agreement should not be published in the next few days.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 7th: British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, speaking in Lowestoft tonight, mentioned the Franco-Italian naval agreement, stating that naval competition could undermine the success of next year's Geneva Disarmament Conference. This Franco-Italian agreement not only stops naval competition but also allows the political issues between France and Italy to be resolved in a spirit of moderation and goodwill. This spirit will surely enable European powers to change their direction and help us establish lasting peace in Europe.</p>

<h3>Jiang Province National Defense Army Replenishment Method</h3>
<p>▲ Plan to Transfer Surplus Soldiers from Shi's Troops to Replenish the Ranks</p>
<p>Shi Youtri Still Does Not Leave Shenyang For Now</p>
<p>Sun Dianying Trains Cadres</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The troops of Shi Youtri of the 13th Route Army were previously reorganized into three Class A divisions based on a three-three system and four Class B divisions based on a two-two system. After Shi's arrival in Shenyang this time, in order to remedy the fundamental problem of insufficient funding for his troops, it was decided to reorganize again, retaining three Class A divisions. The surplus soldiers are to be transferred to the Heilongjiang Provincial Border Defense Commissioner's Office to fill vacancies in the National Defense Army. Since the establishment of the National Defense Army during the Russian defense operations two years ago, there have been many vacancies. This plan is proposed both to strengthen border defense and to provide for the resettlement of surplus soldiers from Shi's troops. Shi has already discussed this with Wan Fulin, the Deputy Commander of the Jiang Province Border Defense. Yu Zhaolin, Wang Yongsheng, and Cheng Zhiyuan, the brigade commanders of the Jiang Province National Defense Army, were summoned to Shenyang by Wan to receive instructions. After arriving in Shenyang, Wang first met with Deputy Commander Zhang. Shi Youtri has been in Shenyang for more than two weeks, and the issues of downsizing and funding have been largely resolved. However, Shi will not be able to leave Shenyang in the immediate future. It is also reported that Sun Dianying, the commander of the 2nd Division of the Army, first sent Yu Shiming, the commander of the 2nd Brigade, and Liu Yueting, the commander of the 4th Brigade, to Shenyang to meet with Zhang and request instructions. They have already arrived in Tianjin from southern Shanxi and are waiting for Sun Dianying to arrive in Tianjin before proceeding together. Sun is scheduled to depart for Shenyang on the 7th. Liu Guitang, the commander of the Provisional 1st Brigade, will also arrive in Shenyang soon to request instructions. It is also heard that Sun Dianying intends to establish an officer training school for the military education of his lower-ranking cadres, with each company sending a lieutenant platoon leader to attend. The course will last three months to provide accelerated training. A notice has been issued, and classes are scheduled to begin before March 15th. A telegram has been sent to the Border Defense Headquarters for record, and Wang Shiping, the representative stationed in Shenyang, has been instructed to purchase various military books in Shenyang and send them to the defense area.

<h3>Jin Army Begins Inspection</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Zhang Xueliang, believing that the Jin and Sui armies have been reorganized one after another, specially appointed Ji Yiqiao and Fu ZhanKuei as inspection commissioners. Ji will inspect the troops stationed in northern Shanxi and the Suiyuan area, while Fu will inspect the troops stationed in southern Shanxi and the Zhengtai area. Zhu Lihan, a Major General Counselor of the Northeast Commander-in-Chief's Office, has been appointed as the chief inspector of the Shanxi artillery, and Peng Zhenguo as the chief inspector of the Shanxi cavalry. Zhu and Peng, along with more than 20 inspection commissioners, will come to Taiyuan soon to conduct the inspection. As for the demobilization expenses of the Jin and Sui armies, Vice Commander Zhang has agreed to have Jing Youyan, the special envoy from Hebei, continue to be responsible for raising 2.8 million yuan. Jing will arrive in Taiyuan soon, and it is estimated that the inspection of various units will be completed by mid-March. Feng Pengzhu, the commander of the 9th Army, returned to Taiyuan the day before yesterday to report to the authorities on the progress of the reorganization of his unit and to negotiate for vehicles to handle the transfer of the army to Shouyang. According to Feng, more than 300 officers were demobilized this time, and more than 2,000 soldiers were originally to be demobilized. However, in addition to filling the vacancies after the war, the actual number of soldiers demobilized was more than 1,000. The rest of my ideas have not been dispelled. Due to the retention of the Chairman and the brigade commander of each division, he had no choice but to first complete the reorganization and demobilization, and then talk about returning to the field. Our Ministry originally belonged to the 27th Division stationed in Niangziguan. Now the division has been incorporated into the 7th Brigade and the 8th Brigade. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to be stationed in Niangziguan. Now it is decided that a brigade will be stationed in Pingxing and a brigade will be stationed in Shouyang. The division command is also located in Shouyang, and I will return to defense in about three to five days.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday (2nd), at 11:00 a.m., Ji Yiqiao, the inspection commissioner of the Jin-Sui Army, came to the large drill field outside Xin Nanmen to inspect the specially formed 5th Division of Li Fuying. In addition to the troops stationed in Yuanping Daixian Wutai, which will be inspected separately, what was inspected that day was the division headquarters and various divisions directly under the division, as well as 24 infantry companies and 6 special companies. Each formed a company column formation. The company commander reported the number of officers and soldiers actually present and the number of weapons. Then ordered the soldiers to report the numbers. In total, there were about 5,780 officials and soldiers, all wearing gray military uniforms, leggings, and belts, all complete. Ji's remarks are briefly stated: "Today I represent the commander-in-chief and deputy commander-in-chief to inspect the Fifth Division. Everyone understands the needs of the times. The officers and soldiers can all obey the reorganization. This is the most memorable thing in China in the twenty years since the Xinhai Revolution. From the beginning of the Republic of China to the present, disasters and chaos are equal. After countless battles and countless places ruined, until now Yan Feng stepped down and the national affairs were settled, and the military power was returned to the central government, it can be seen that the soldiers have become greatly enlightened. As for the demobilized officers, personnel have been assigned to establish a Wutang in Beiping, which will be separately empty-filled to ensure that the school is deepened. The expenses for enrollment are also planned properly, so don’t worry. Today's observation of the team is very good in spirit, and the morale is very high. I hope that everyone will increase training and work hard after today's reform, so as to become the backbone of the National Army and the armed forces of the people." After the speech, a photo was taken with the commissioners, Li Fuying, and other officials, and they were dismissed. (March 3rd)</p>
<h3>Budget Standards for Administrative Expenditures in Northern Provinces</h3>
<p>▲ Determined After the Financial Conference</p>
<p>▲ Divided into Three Levels</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The budget expenditures of the administrative agencies in the northern provinces have always been managed by their own governments. Some have been extravagant, while others have been in deficit. This time, Vice Commander Zhang convened a financial conference for the northern provinces. Regarding the annual budgets of the provincial governments and their subordinate departments, the attendees jointly resolved to establish a certain standard in order to economize and demonstrate fairness. The method is to divide the provinces into three levels, and the amount of annual funding for each agency is determined according to the level of the province. For example, for the provincial government, the first level is set at 300,000 yuan, the second level at 250,000 yuan, and the third level at 200,000 yuan. For the Department of Civil Affairs, the first level is 70,000 yuan, the second level is 60,000 yuan, and the third level is 50,000 yuan. For the Department of Finance, the first level is 150,000 yuan, the second level is 120,000 yuan, and the third level is 90,000 yuan. For the Department of Education, the first level is 60,000 yuan, the second level is 50,000 yuan, and the third level is 40,000 yuan. The two departments of agriculture, mining, and construction, and the police department are the same as the Department of Education. The Political Affairs Committee has reviewed and approved the proposal and ordered the provincial governments to be informed. It is also planned that Hebei will be listed as the first level, Liaoning, Jilin, and Shanxi will be listed as the second level, and Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Chahar will be listed as the third level. However, because the original budgets of the provinces are insufficient to be included in the third level, and some exceed the first level, how to increase the insufficient amount and how to reduce the excess amount are still being carefully reviewed. It is also heard that the two provinces of Rehe and Jilin are planned to be in accordance with the original budget, without any increase or decrease. (March 4th)</p>

Chen Cheng, the commander of the 14th Division, went to Jiangxi with Wang Jinyu a few days ago to report on the progress of the battle and asked for instructions on everything. He returned to Wuhan from the province on the 2nd. It is heard that Chen's Division and Luo Zhuoying's Division have also been ordered by He Yingqin to move from the Hunan-Hubei border to the Gan border to take over the defense of Wang Jinyu's troops, so that the divisions of Guo Huazong and others of Wang's troops can advance to Ji'an in western Jiangxi. The Cai Division of the 19th Route Army has already broken through the bandit nest in Tiancun, beheading and capturing hundreds of people, and rescuing hundreds of hostages. The Ma Brigade of the 12th Division and the Ding Corps of the Dai Division are patrolling in Xinfeng, intercepting many important members of the Communist bandits. The two rivers from Wan'an to Ganzhou and from Xinfeng to Ganzhou have been cleared, and traffic is unimpeded. They are now searching and suppressing the Communist bandits in the river channel from Yudu to Ganzhou, restoring the traffic between Gan and Yu. The Mao Xu three divisions of the Sixth Route Army still hold the line of Nanfeng Yihuang, and the Ninth Route Army in Ji'an Taihe will all join the Fifth Route Army and the 26th Route Army to encircle and attack the Communist bandits. Therefore, the date of the general attack is not far away. In order to promote doctrine and move the people of the bandit areas, Commander-in-Chief Chiang specially selected more than 300 outstanding students from the Central Military Academy to form a bandit suppression propaganda office, led by He Zhonghan, the director of the office, to come to the province, divided into more than ten sub-offices. After meeting with He in batches, He instructed everything. It is heard that the sub-offices of the office will immediately go to various divisions and turn to the front line for work. As for the Second Propaganda Brigade of the Headquarters, it is currently working in the Ji'an Jishui Xiajiang area, and will hold a masquerade performance in Ji to entertain the bandit-suppressing soldiers and all sectors of the people to encourage cooperation between officials and people to suppress the bandits. Sun Lianzhong's troops have all completed their departure, Jinan Correspondence: Since February 18th, the Twenty-sixth Route Army, Sun Lianzhong's troops, has been transferred to Jiangxi, and there have been more than 30 trains sent out so far. In the past one or two days, there have been fewer and fewer military transportations on the Jinpu Road. It is said that Sun's army, except for those who stayed behind to guard, has mostly completed its departure. As for the remaining Lunan defense area, it is heard that the Third Route Command has already decided on a proper plan: the Li Hanzhang Department of the 85th Brigade stationed in Tengxian will be transferred to Yanzhou, and the Ma Quanliang Division originally stationed in Yanzhou will be transferred to the counties of Jining Jiaxiang Juye Dingtao, etc. The Rong Guangxing Department of the 87th Brigade stationed in Liaocheng will be divided into Cheng and Heze. The deployment of this new defense area will be officially announced within a few days. (6th)</p>
<h3>Bandits Near Guangshui Have Been Defeated</h3>
<p>▲ Hubei and Henan Armies Continue to Pursue the Remnants of Bandits</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The bandit communists in the border area of the three provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, including the pseudo-First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fifteenth Armies, and the Red Supplementary Army, have repeatedly robbed regiments and guns in Shangcheng Gushi Guangshan Xixian Huayuan Xinzhou Tuanpi and other places. After the government army joined forces to suppress them, the bandit forces were slightly reduced, but Guangji Huangmei Macheng Luotian Huangpi Xiaogan Qichun Yingshan Huoshan Guangshan Gushi Shangcheng Xixian Huanggang and other counties are still being disrupted. Since January, there have been daily reports of Communist bandits attacking cities and towns in the three provinces. For example, Guangji was once occupied by bandits, and Huangmei Qichun was also besieged by bandits, while Guangshan Gushi and other counties were also harassed by them. In addition, in the mountains and mountains in the area of ​​Mab Sujiabu Liubotuan Jinjiazha, which are connected to the three provinces, they built fortifications to support the corner. However, on the 2nd of this month, more than 10,000 bandits were found near Guangshui on the Pinghan Road, occupying Jinjiazha Station. When the Wuhan Camp telegraphed Yuan Ying, the commander of the New 12th Division, to send troops to suppress the bandits, the bandits were outnumbered, and they were not repelled until the 3rd. They added two units of Zhang Yinxiang Yue Weijun, and the Railway Artillery Team, to cooperate in handling the matter. The Kaifeng Camp also telegraphed Zhao Guantao's Sixth Division, the Wang Chen Brigade, to attack from Xuzhou via Xinyang. On the 4th, they were respectively concentrated and began to attack. The bandit forces were unsustainable, so they fled to the east and west. The Li camp of Yuan Ying's troops completely recovered Li Jiazhai. The staff office of the division telegraphed yesterday to report the victory, saying, "It is said in the report of Li camp leader Fengwu that he led the team to fight fiercely with the Communist bandits in Fuzishan for several hours. The bandit forces retreated, and most of them fled to the southeast. I should immediately send a team to track and pursue them. More than 200 Communist bandits were killed on the spot, and more than 100 guns were seized, as well as countless flags, knives, and spears. Now I have completely recovered Li Jiazhai. In addition to sending a team to protect the railway workers and repair the railway bridge in order to restore traffic as soon as possible, I am currently sending a team to pursue it, etc. In addition to sending a separate telegram to request that the troops stationed in various places intercept the army as soon as possible, they also ordered the front-line troops to search and suppress the bandits near the railway line. "After receiving the telegram, the camp ordered Zhang Yinxiang's department to be responsible for pursuing the bandits and put the railway artillery team under his command. The remaining Yuan Ying troops are still stationed near Minggang, Yue Weijun's troops are still stationed near Wusheng Pass, and Zhao Guanwan's troops are still stationed near Xinyang to avoid the chaos. On the one hand, the road bureau was ordered to send workers to repair the tracks as soon as possible to restore traffic. It was also heard that in the battle of the 3rd, Yuan Ying's army died in the battle. It has not been ascertained where the remnants of the Communist bandits have fled. Li Mingzhong, the pacification director of the three provinces on the border, decided to depart to inspect the situation in the border areas and the situation of the Communist bandits withdrawing from various places in order to be clear about the situation in the border areas and the retreat of the Communist bandits from various places.</p>
<h3>Bandits in Southern Henan Kill Each Other</h3>
<p>▲ Bandit Leaders Ding Tuzi and Others Were Killed by Their Comrades</p>
<p>▲ Dai Minquan Is Now Sending Teams to Search for the Remaining Bandits</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Ding Tuzi, a well-known bandit leader in southern Henan, previously colluded with Li Kebang and other bandits to harass the territory of Gushi Huangchuan Xixian, and the local area suffered greatly. After Dai Minquan's troops of the newly formed 25th Division of the Army stationed in Gushi pursued them in the Bailu River area of ​​Huangchuan in the snow, Ding was seriously injured and fled with more than a dozen bandits to the vicinity of Guduiji in Xisu County, where they hid for treatment. Dai Minquan's troops learned of this and sent a team to rush to search for them overnight, and ordered the local militia to block the area to prevent them from escaping. The bandit party, Sun Qingshan and others, felt that the situation was critical, and at the end of last month, they suddenly killed the bandit leader Ding Tuzi and his comrades Ding Wanchang, Ding San, Ding Liu, Ding Ergezi, Ren Baiyanzi, Zhang Mo, Yan Laogan and other twelve people in Mayingzi, southeast of Guduiji, and cut off the heads of the bandits and sent them to the Xisu County Government to surrender and ask for a new life. The people were happy to hear this. Dai Minquan is now sending guerrillas to search for the remnants, hoping to clear them completely in the near future. (March 6th)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Suppression of Bandits in Baodu Mountain, Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Baodu Tree in southern Shandong is the largest bandit lair in Shandong. The mountains are treacherous, the paths are complex, and the bandits living there have a sense of a secluded paradise. When bandits in other areas are under urgent attack by the army, they flee into the mountains, which is also a haven for bandits who have escaped. Recently, Sun Meisong's gang dared to attack Zaozhuang fiercely, but fortunately failed and left. Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu believes that the bandits are so bold that they should be eliminated as soon as possible. Moreover, because the mountains are continuous and the terrain is vast, it will not be effective unless a comprehensive encirclement and suppression method is adopted. Therefore, Provincial Committee Member Zhang Yue was sent to Beijing today (the 6th) to report this situation. It is also heard that the proposed plan is to have one unit stationed in Lincheng to block the southwest side, one unit in the Yizhou area to block the south side, one unit in Teng County to block the west side, one unit in the Tai'an area to block the north side, and one unit in the Linqu Anqiu area to block the east side, for a comprehensive encirclement and suppression, striving to eliminate them all. It is also decided that this time, regardless of civilians or bandits, all guns will be confiscated to thoroughly clean up the countryside. Today, Provincial Chairman Han told reporters that Sun Lianzhong's unit in Jining has already departed, with only a few left behind. The 85th Brigade of Li Hanzhang was originally scheduled to fill Sun's defense, but this has been temporarily postponed due to the bandit suppression, and may be transferred to Jining Yuncheng after the bandit suppression.

<h3>Ye Yixiong Case Debate Concluded</h3>
<p>▲ Awaiting Sentencing on a Fixed Date</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Shenyang Local Court of the Binjiang Special Zone Court heard the case of Ye Yixiong, an alternate judge, shooting Zhang Wang Liqing in open court in the Criminal Division 1 at 1:00 PM on the 4th. The audience was more enthusiastic than the previous hearing. The trial was still presided over by Tang Yinfen, the Presiding Judge of Criminal Division 1, with Associate Judges Li Hongwen and Yang Xuemen, and Prosecutor Xue Shuping stating their opinions. At 1:20, Ye was brought out from the detention center. Ye's attitude was as usual. The court-appointed lawyer Zhang Shiying and Ye's newly hired lawyer Wang Jingxuan both appeared in court to defend him. First, the clerk announced that the trial of Ye Yixiong's murder and encroachment case would continue today. Then, Presiding Judge Tang asked, "Are you Ye Yixiong?" He answered, "Yes." He asked, "How old are you? Where are you from? Where do you live?" He answered, "Thirty-two years old, from Fujian, formerly lived on 14th Street in Harbin." The judge then asked the prosecutor to announce the charges. Prosecutor Xue announced Ye Yixiong's premeditated murder and slow encroachment of property charges. After the announcement, the judge asked Ye, "Did you hear the prosecutor's indictment?" He answered, "Yes, I heard it. The prosecutor's accusation that I premeditated the murder is incorrect because the pistol was not bought recently, but in the 11th year of the Republic when I was a student." He asked, "What did you buy the pistol for back then?" He answered, "Because there were often Ming Hu bandits at the Russian school, I bought it for self-defense. Moreover, my classmate Rui Youban knew when I bought the pistol. Even Ms. Zhang herself knew I had a pistol." He asked, "In the second instance, you testified that Rui Youban and Ms. Zhang knew you had a pistol. When this presiding judge personally went to Binjiang to investigate, he summoned Rui Youban, Ms. Zhang, and your wife, Ms. Peng. Rui Youban testified that it was true that you bought a pistol in the 11th year of the Republic, but he had not seen you carry a pistol after you bought it. He could not tell whether the pistol used to shoot Ms. Zhang this time was the same one from before. Ms. Zhang herself testified that when she was often with you before, she once saw something bulging in your coat pocket that looked like a pistol, but she had never seen the real thing. As for your wife, Ms. Peng, she testified that she did not know you had a pistol. The contents already have various doubts." He answered, "The words of Ms. Zhang and Rui Youban are completely unreliable. My wife, Ms. Peng, simply doesn't know I have a pistol because I live at home, also in the court's public residence, and the gun is kept in the public residence. How would she know?" He asked, "Your gun license is lost. Don't you even remember the number? Are there any other evidences?" He answered, "No." He asked, "Why did you kill Ms. Zhang?" He answered, "It was because of jealousy. On the train, I saw the love letter she wrote to Liu Helong, '[The] moon cake is almost to your mouth.' I couldn't help but be consumed by jealousy. In a moment of anger, I deceived her into getting off the train, wanting to persuade her and for her to have a change of heart and return to our old love. Unexpectedly, she started scolding me, and in a moment of extreme anger, I shot her with the pistol." He asked, "Ms. Zhang is now around thirty years old, and you also have a wife. Of course, Ms. Zhang cannot agree to be a concubine. In fact, it is impossible. She already loves someone else. Why would you be angry?" He answered, "We have been very good to each other since we were acquainted, and our relationship was not bad. Once she loved someone else, how could I not be angry?" He asked, "After you shot Ms. Zhang with the gun, did you search her belongings?" He answered, "No." He asked, "This presiding judge asked Ms. Zhang in Harbin. She said she was engaged to Liu Helong. Did you know about it?" He answered, "I didn't know about it. Moreover, our relationship was very good. How could a third person participate?" He asked, "Ms. Zhang herself testified that she told you about the engagement to Liu Helong as a temporary threat and not a happy marriage. Is that true?" He answered, "She also hinted at it to me. Later, I questioned her. She said she would never admit to the marriage contract with Liu Helong." He asked, "When Ms. Zhang was about to return to Beiping on the 21st, did you ask her when she would return? She answered 'two, three, five, six years, uncertain.' Then she sighed and said, 'Sending you off for a thousand miles, we must eventually part ways.' Did she say these words?" He answered, "I don't remember clearly. Probably, yes." He asked, "When she was about to return to Beiping this time, did she leave anything in your possession?" He answered, "There was a share of Xiexing Sauce Garden stock and some scattered items. She took all the valuable items with her." He asked, "After you shot Zhang Liqing, you had the money order with you. Did you intend to encroach on it?" He answered, "No. The name on the order is hers. Even if I have the money order, I can't withdraw the money." He asked, "When did you become involved with her?" He answered, "It was last year." He asked, "Do you have anything else to say today?" He answered, "I have a few more words. However, at the beginning, after I shot Zhang Liqing and was arrested, I didn't want to reveal our relationship. Therefore, I confessed to the Shuangcheng Police Section 6 that the gun went off accidentally and injured someone. Later, at the Binjiang Local Court Prosecutor's Office, I was forced to tell the whole truth. In short, I shot her with the pistol out of jealousy and purely in a moment of anger. I have been a judge for six or seven years. I can honestly say that I have been conscientious in both public and private matters. What I did this time concerns the reputation of the entire judicial community. Fortunately, it is my personal matter. I humbly request the judge to make a fair judgment according to the law. I am extremely grateful."</p>
<p>At this point, the judge said, "Please have the honorable prosecutor state their opinion on this case." Prosecutor Xue Shuping stood up and stated their opinion, which roughly stated that Ye Yixiong's crime has two parts: (1) attempted premeditated murder and (2) encroachment. The premeditated murder part is divided into two points: (1) the act of murder, which the defendant has admitted without denial. The question to be investigated is whether it was premeditated murder or ordinary murder. The defendant's claim that he intended to murder out of jealousy after seeing the letter is incorrect because, although the defendant argued that he bought the pistol in the 11th year of the Republic and that classmate Rui Shiban and Ms. Zhang knew about it, Rui Youban was questioned by this court's Presiding Judge Tang in Binjiang and confirmed that he knew the defendant bought a gun in the 11th year of the Republic, but had not seen the defendant carry the gun afterwards. Ms. Zhang also testified that she saw the defendant carrying it in her coat pocket, but it was only a vague impression and there was no substantial evidence. Moreover, Ye threw away the murder weapon, the pistol. Whether the pistol used to shoot Ms. Zhang this time was the same one from before cannot be proven. The crime of premeditated murder is naturally established. (2) The encroachment part is even more obvious because, although the money order is in Zhang Liqing's name, her seal is in the defendant's possession and he can also withdraw the money. Moreover, he threw away all the other items and only hid the money order in his sock, which clearly shows his intention to encroach. However, it must be asked whether the encroachment was premeditated or an afterthought. The defendant carried Ms. Zhang's money order and seal completely on his person, which is certainly a premeditated act. He should be charged under Article 74 of the Criminal Code. The court is requested to make a fair judgment according to the law. Then, the judge asked Ye, "Do you have any rebuttal to what the prosecutor has stated?" He answered, "The prosecutor's claim that I premeditated the murder is incorrect. If I had premeditated the murder, I could have killed her in Binjiang, or I could have harmed her in Beiping. Why did I kill her in Shuangcheng in the middle of the journey? I did it purely because I saw the love letter she sent to Liu Helong. I was consumed by jealousy and acted in a moment of anger. As for the encroachment, it is even less of a problem. If I had intended to encroach on her, she had given me four thousand yuan before. Why didn't I encroach on it then? Even on the 21st, when she returned to Beiping, she asked me in advance to withdraw the money from the bank and then asked me to remit it to Beiping. If I had intended to encroach, wouldn't I have absconded with the money?" Then, Wang Jingxuan, the lawyer hired by Ye, argued that the defendant's murder was purely out of a moment of anger because, when he shot Ms. Zhang, he only fired one shot and did not aim at a vital point. Later, when he heard Ms. Zhang cry out, if the defendant had the determination to kill her, wouldn't he have fired another shot? Moreover, if it was premeditated, he could have killed her anytime and anywhere in Harbin. This shows that the defendant did not attempt premeditated murder and should be sentenced for injury under Article 153 of the Criminal Code. As for the encroachment part, the defendant also said that when he remitted the money on the 21st, he could have absconded. Why wait until after he shot Zhang Liqing to encroach? The court is requested to make a fair judgment according to the law. Then, Zhang Shiying, the lawyer appointed by the court, argued. Then, the court returned to Ye the keys, gold ticket worth twenty yuan, and eighty yuan in silver dollars that had been searched from his waist when he was first arrested. Then, the judge stood up and said, "The debate in this case is concluded. Awaiting sentencing on a fixed date." The court adjourned at 3:20 PM. (March 5th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Solves Two Banditry Cases: Yang Shijie, an inspector of the county Public Security Bureau, recently learned that Ni Ruiyun, an accomplice of the executed bandit Yao Jinshan, was hiding in the Dongbailianjing area of Shanghai, gathering bandits and planning to commit crimes in Wuche and other places. He went to Pudong to investigate the case the day before yesterday and met him in a teahouse. He was immediately arrested, and the other bandits took the opportunity to flee in all directions. Bandit Ni had changed his name to Yu Azhen and had repeatedly committed banditry cases, and was also identified by Yao Jinshan and Zhang Xiaodi in their confessions. He was sent to the Special Municipal Public Security Bureau for detention. Inspector Yang returned to Songjiang to prepare official documents and went to Shanghai yesterday to bring back the bandit Ni. During the preliminary trial at the Public Security Bureau, he confessed to the location of the hidden firearms. It is said that he will be escorted to retrieve the guns today (the 8th) so that he can be handed over to the county for investigation. In addition, Pan Yongqiang, the director of the Tinglin Public Security First Branch, also captured an important bandit named Tan Mengguan and sent him to the Public Security Bureau on the 8th.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>National Assembly Election Qualifications: Pan Zhongjia, the supervisor of the National Assembly election representatives in this county, received a telegram from the election general supervisor Hu Pu'an, stating that there were no examples of election qualifications. He immediately submitted a request to General Supervisor Hu to inquire whether the shipping guild, fishing association, and other organizations were eligible to vote. He immediately received a reply stating that the shipping guild and fishing association were both eligible to vote. After receiving the telegram, Supervisor Pan summoned representatives from the shipping guild to the county for a discussion. Because the organization of the people's association was promulgated, the relevant procedures for registration with the competent authorities had not been completed, which seemed inconsistent with the election law. The association had previously registered with the Ministry of Communications. Was it necessary to complete the procedures again? The association sent a telegram to the ministry to request instructions. As for the fishing association, it has not yet been organized and established in this county, so there are no qualifications to speak of. In addition, Supervisor Pan received telegrams from General Supervisor Hu on the fish and hemp industries stating that if the electoral organizations in various places have not yet been organized, the party departments at all levels should guide the organization and establishment, and the competent authorities should approve the registration as soon as possible. If they have already been registered, they should naturally have the right to vote. In addition, the registration books of various organizations should strictly comply with Article 7 of the election law, and all items should be recorded without omission. The first batch of registration books of the organizations in this county were sent to the province yesterday for review, and the second batch will also be sent to the province for review within two or three days.</p>

<p>The Amusing Drama of Three Heroes Fighting for a Widow: In the Xingtang North area of the 8th District (Huaixia City) of this county, Figure 452, Lu Shishi, the widow of Lu Gengshang, is in her twenties and has a beautiful appearance. Her husband, Lu Peisheng, died of illness last winter. There are three or four mu of paddy fields in the family, but no one to cultivate them. On the 2nd of this month, she recruited Lu Rensheng from Jiangyin as a tenant. After entering the door, the couple got along quite well. The day before yesterday night, Lu Xuxian, the head of the figure, led twenty or thirty villagers, and brought along the brothers Lu Arong and Lu Anan, went to the house and broke in. The later husband, Rensheng, knew that things were not good and climbed onto the roof to escape. After Lu Arong and his brothers entered the room, they searched everywhere for Rensheng, but could not find him. Then they entered the bedroom and lay on Lu Shishi's bed, refusing to move and forcibly ordered Shishi to sleep with them. The incident was discovered by neighbors, who believed that the brothers Lu Arong were unreasonably causing trouble and bullying the widow, which was extremely illegal. They reported it to the 16th branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge. After receiving the report, the director of the branch immediately sent police officers to arrest the brothers Lu Arong and Lu Anan and sent them to the headquarters. Yesterday, they were transferred to the county court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>After the Robbery Case at Dayi Bridge: On the evening of the 2nd of this month, a sand boat passed through the market river in Dayi Bridge Town, Jiuzhe District, loaded with a large amount of opium. Qian Linlin, Monk Linshi, and other local gangsters learned about it and followed it to the edge of the market to carry out the robbery. It is now heard that after receiving this news, the county Public Security Bureau dispatched patrol officer Cheng Bin of the headquarters and Inspector Chen Pinquan on the evening of February 5th to take a boat to the countryside overnight for investigation. They soon learned that the opium was said to have come from the South Sha District. The reason why it was discovered by the gangsters and intercepted on the way was that there were a total of two bamboo baskets of opium (each bamboo basket is about four feet high). After patrol officer Cheng and others went to the countryside, they met with patrol officer Fang Fengzhao of the 10th resident office of the Public Security Bureau in the jurisdiction and went to the homes of Qian Beilin, Monk Linshi, Wang Gensong, and Wang Bingsheng, who went to seize the land with Qian and Linshi, to investigate. They were all tightly closed and locked with iron locks. When they opened the door to enter the room, it was empty. The four families of Qian, Linshi, Wang, and others have been temporarily guarded by the police from the 10th resident office, and they are searching for the whereabouts of Qian and others. Subsequently, the investigation team arrested Shi Pangshi, the wife of Monk Linshi. After the judicial section interrogated her, she confessed that Shi and others were now hiding in the homes of relatives near Xingfu outside the North Gate. Detectives were dispatched that night to arrest him, but they could not find him. The Public Security Bureau is paying close attention to this case.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Detective Team Arrests Huang Bingying: Huang Bingying, who was accused in the land reclamation case, returned to his hometown the day before yesterday and requested the Public Security Bureau to be exempted from the summons and to appear in court after the defendant arrived in court. He also published an advertisement in the local newspaper. The day before yesterday evening, Chen Dun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, ordered Fan Gongzhi, the captain of the detective team, to search the home of Huang Zhiyue in Beizhen Lane for opium addicts and seized opium utensils and opium customers Wu Yuquan and Su Shuxin. Because Huang was not there, he went to the home of Huang Binghuang in Nanjie and arrested Huang and sent him to the headquarters for handling.</p>
<p>Police Raid Gambling Dens: Chen Dun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, ordered a strict ban on opium, gambling, and prostitution as soon as he took office. The day before yesterday, he ordered Fan Gongzhi, the captain of the detective team, to search Beitai East Transportation for Guan Fuchen, who was posing as a military officer. During the search at East Transportation, because the plainclothes team members Yan Jinsheng and Liu Zhijiu acted barbarously, Fan had communication issues and clashed with accountant Wang Peiqing. On the 6th, they reported to the hostel association to hold a meeting and asked party and government agencies for relief to maintain business. Later, it was peacefully resolved through the mediation of Zhu Pengxian, the chairman of the association. Fan found at Transportation that Guan Fuchen was sleeping in the same bed with the Yang girls Zhou Wenbao and Zhou Ribao, and immediately took them to the bureau. In addition, Superintendent Wang Wenzhong went to the west end of Fuqiao outside the North Gate to catch gamblers and clashed with more than ten members of the anti-smuggling team. Several police officers were injured and the gamblers also fled. Superintendent Wang went to a branch bureau and asked the police to come and assist, and detained Yang Yulin, Liu Zhenyuan, Lin Bingkun, and Chen Shaowu, four people, and reported it to the bureau. They were sentenced to detention and the matter was closed.</p>

When entering the door, he claimed to exchange two dimes for copper coins.

This approach has been agreed upon by the Daoist nun representatives. However, the other Daoist nuns received the news and unanimously opposed it, stating that they would not stop until the old appearance was restored.

Before leaving, they kidnapped Jinxian's son (23 years old) and Nianting's son (8 years old). Moreover, in the Shangmugang Town of Qu Dong District, the previous evening, forty or more bandits arrived, armed with guns and weapons. They first went to the local public security substation, injured Chief Zhang's head, and robbed several businesses in the town, including Tongchang Rice Shop, Zhang Zhengshun's North-South Goods Store, and Zhang Zhenghe's Butcher Shop. The money and goods were looted clean. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the police for investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Water Police Extortion, Escort to the Court for Investigation - Zhou, a farmhand employed by Zhang Xiangneng, a farmer from Wangjiangjing Township in Jiaxing, had previously lured away Zhang's daughter. Zhang entrusted Detective Lin of the 7th Team of the Qianyao Water Police to investigate. (Because Zhou was from Qianyao.) After many days, he was found. The team ordered Zhang to come and take her away. Later, Wu Wenhua, the leader of the 1st Team of the Water Police, Chen Boqian, the clerk, Zhang Zhangxiang, Zhang Wenhua, and the water policeman Xu Junxuan Yunzuo and other six persons, demanded a reward of one hundred yuan from Zhang. After several rounds of negotiations, they refused to lower the price. Zhang then filed a complaint with the Water Police Headquarters. After receiving the complaint, Captain Xiong learned that Wu Wenhua and others had indeed extorted money from the party concerned. He was furious and yesterday prepared a document to escort Wu and other six people to the Jiaxing Local Court for investigation according to the law.</p>

<h3>Xu Jianping Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>▲Represents Mo Dehui in Shanghai to Host a Banquet</p>
<p>▲Xu to Go to Europe in May and Then to Russia</p>
<p>Xu Jianping, Counselor of the Ministry of Industry, newly appointed as a member of the Sino-Russian Conference, hosted a banquet for reporters from various newspapers at the Dongya Restaurant at 7:00 p.m. yesterday on behalf of Mo Dehui. More than ten people, including representatives from Shen Bao, the Republic of China Daily, and the News, as well as Qian Jiechen, Shen Nengyi, and others, attended. During the meal, Mr. Xu rose and delivered a speech, stating that in the previous nine months of the Sino-Russian Conference, due to the lack of unity within the country and the lack of effective cooperation between the central government and the Northeast, only two formal meetings were held and about ten informal talks, with no significant results. Now that unification has been achieved and the central government and local governments are in complete agreement, the plenipotentiary representative, Mo Dehui, has come to Beijing to ask for instructions on the negotiating strategy. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Central Political Council decided on the method and sent four others, including myself, to assist. A satisfactory result is expected. The main negotiating strategy is to first resolve the China Eastern Railway issue and then discuss the resumption of transportation and trade. Since I have been in the Ministry of Industry for some time, I am responsible for drafting the Sino-Russian Commercial Treaty. Russia has special circumstances and there is no blueprint that can be used as a reference for commercial treaties with various countries. I am deeply afraid of the heavy responsibility and hope that you will give me more guidance. Representative Mo was unable to come to Shanghai to meet with you all while he was in Beijing, which is a great regret. Therefore, he entrusted me to invite you to a gathering. I would like to propose a toast and wish you all good health. It is heard that Mr. Xu will go to Europe in May to attend the International Labour Conference. After the closing ceremony, he will go to Moscow from Europe to attend the conference.</p>
<h3>Xinchang Crew Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>▲The Hull is Still on the Reef</p>
<p>▲The Shipowner Went to Inspect First</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Xinchang Wheel ran aground on Ma'anshan Reef, as detailed in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the crew and sailors were rescued back to Shanghai. The following is a continuation of the news obtained:</p>
<p>▲The Truth about the Accident - The Xinchang Wheel was at 7:05 p.m. on the afternoon of the 6th</p>
<p>It arrived near Ma'anshan, in the Beiding waters. The shipowner and the first mate were on duty together. At that time, it was dark and foggy, and the wind and waves were high. When they approached Beiding, the first mate and the shipowner discovered that there was a mountain in front of them. They urgently ordered the driver to turn around and put the engine in reverse in the hope of safely retreating. Unexpectedly, a wave struck the Xinchang and hit it onto the reef. At that time, some advocated reversing the engine to try to get out, but the old helmsman was afraid that the bottom of the wheel would be scratched and it would sink immediately. The lives of the entire ship would be lost. So, he resisted it and stopped it. At that time, the front part of the wheel was already on the reef, and the rear part was still on the sea, which was dangerous. He immediately started the engine and sent the entire hull onto the reef so that it could be maintained and not sunk. All the people on the ship celebrated their rebirth. ▲Crew Seeking Refuge After the accident, the crew, sailors, and others released sampans into the sea in the darkness. Twenty-five people risked boarding the Jardine Matheson Gungshing Wheel. With the efforts of the Gungshing shipowner, crew, and head cook, they were rescued safely and returned to Shanghai first. The others were sent to the mountain there in batches by sampan to take temporary shelter. The crew members found it very difficult to go into the sea in the dark. Two people fell into the sea, but fortunately, they came up again. There was also a comprador's assistant, from Ningbo, 53 years old, who had just boarded the ship. He seemed to be missing because he pushed the sampan into the sea to escape. The rest were safe.</p>
<p>▲Warship Rescue The Customs Lilin Plate arrived at the scene of the accident first. The people escaping on the mountain who were being rescued were boarded onto the warship in batches. It was planned to send them back to Shanghai. Then, the China Merchants Bureau hired a徳豐拖驳雪浦逊號 arrived. The person rescued by Lilin was then transferred to the barge to return to Shanghai. At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the barge arrived at裏洞沙 and met the 温州班轮广济號 of the Bureau. They were immediately transferred to the广济 ship, ordered 广济 to turn around, and carried the crew members, etc., who had escaped. Arrived in Shanghai. The barge Snow Pason was carrying the Chief Shipowner, etc., to inspect the scene of the accident.</p>
<p>▲Crew Returning to Shanghai The Guangzhou Wheel was carrying a total of eighty-one crew members and sailors who had been rescued. The Second Officer Sun Zhuoren also returned to Shanghai. At 3:00 p.m., he landed at the 金利源碼頭. The Seamen's Union and the Junan Company's Middle Cabin Department sent representatives to the dock with small flags to welcome the fellow workers who had been rescued back to Shanghai. Li, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, also sent people to the scene to comfort the staff and arrange food and accommodation. When the crew members were fleeing for their lives in a hurry, their luggage and belongings were completely abandoned, and their clothes and shoes were not complete. It can be seen how embarrassed they were. After arriving in Shanghai, they went to the union to open a list of losses and temporarily stayed at No. 23 Daan Inn in the French Concession.</p>
<p>▲Eight People Going to Ningbo All the crew members and cargo merchants, except for one assistant who went missing, were safe. A total of 106 people had arrived in Shanghai on the previous two days. There were still eight crew members who escaped to the mountain and first went to Ningbo on fishing boats along the coast. These eight people are expected to return to Shanghai from Ningbo today.</p>
<p>▲Crew Inspection Shipowner Sha Deng, together with Chief Shipowner Mackenzie, Engineer Zhang Yao, First Mate Zhao Shimei, etc., yesterday took the barge Snow Pason back to the site of the Xinchang accident to conduct an on-site survey in order to plan the salvage. Yesterday morning, the China Merchants Bureau originally planned to send Yu Shunlun to Ma'anshan to work with workers and divers. Because the towing and salvage had to wait for the Chief Shipowner to return to Shanghai before it could be determined, Yu Shunlun was prepared, but did not set off. In addition, when the Haiyan Wheel arrived at Ma'anshan yesterday morning, the crew members had already been rescued, so the wheel set sail and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Navy Protection The sea atmosphere there is not peaceful. After the Xinchang accident, four ships that looked like pirate ships tried to approach the wheel. Fortunately, Li, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, had telegraphed the Mei Military Department to send the warship豫章号 to protect it, so there was no danger.</p>

The pictures and slogans were very moving. People from all walks of life attended the meeting enthusiastically, reaching thousands of people. The order was maintained by the Boy Scouts of Jinan University. The following is a description: At 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, the meeting began as usual. First, Ms. Luo Jun, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that today is a commemoration of the International Women's Movement. This association held a commemorative meeting to awaken women's awareness and seek women's liberation. Next, Ms. Guo Zhenyi, representative of the Women's Youth Association Self-Reliance Society, gave a speech. Then, Li Zheng, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chen Zhenquan, representative of the Women's Relief Association, Wang Liming, representative of the Women's Temperance Association, Zhu Yingpeng, Municipal Supervisory Committee, and Professor Zhang Yi of Fudan, gave speeches in succession, saying that the liberation of women's movement hopes that the women's community will continue to work hard.

Also, a telegram was sent: All newspapers in Shanghai forwarded to all levels of party departments, agencies, and groups across the country, Jiejian. The election of representatives to the National Assembly is imminent. Although statutory groups, regardless of gender, try to balance the actual situation, it will definitely be difficult to achieve equality. The General's manual outlines the 12th internal policy, which says that in law, economy, education, and society, the principle of equality between men and women is confirmed and the development of women's rights is promoted. The intention is far-reaching. Whether the status of women's rights today has reached equality is another question, but promoting development is indeed a critical plan. Our society believes that the election of this National Assembly, in addition to ordinary groups participating with female comrades, should also specifically stipulate the participation of purely women's groups in order to conform to the General's intention to promote the development of women's rights. My colleagues in the society have received higher education and it is our duty to lead women. We especially hope that all levels of party departments, agencies, and groups across the country will unanimously support us. We are deeply grateful. Shanghai Women's Youth Self-Reliance Society Commemorates March 8th Telegram.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Petition Delegation Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Satisfactory Results</p>
<p>Due to the silk industry public debt regulations amended by the Legislative Yuan, which only allow the issuance of debt of 6 million yuan, it is still necessary to submit 2 million yuan to be used by the Ministry of Industry to improve silk. The silk factories in the three districts cannot afford to spend it, and the benefits obtained are minimal but the burden is too heavy. Therefore, the representatives of the silk factory industry in the three districts of Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Shanghai were convened in Shanghai to hold a temporary emergency meeting. Wang Xiaolai and Chu Fucheng were publicly recommended as representatives. They went to Beijing by night train on the 5th to petition the hospitals and departments. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the two representatives Wang Chu have completed their work in Beijing. The 京沪夜快车 at the night of the previous day, and returned to Shanghai at 6:00 a.m. yesterday. They reported to the representatives, such as Shen Huachen, chairman of the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association, on the petition process in Beijing. The results obtained were very satisfactory. The two representatives arrived in Beijing on the 6th. In the afternoon, they first went to the National Government to visit Chairman Jiang and made a clear statement about the public debt of 4 million yuan, which was not enough to maintain the silk industry in the three districts. Meng Yun ordered the Ministry of Finance to discuss other distribution methods. Then went to the Ministry of Finance, where he was received by Li Tiao, the permanent secretary. The next morning, he went to the Ministry of Industry, where he was received by Minister Kong, and both agreed to discuss it at length. At noon, at the Central Hotel, a banquet was held for the members of the Legislative Yuan. Twelve people, including Niu Yongjian and Luo Ding, attended. During the meeting, the two representatives Wang Chu stated the difficulties and the purpose of the petition. Each member's idea is that since this case has been amended, the resolution should be announced. If there is any change, it should be submitted to the National Government and then to the Legislative Yuan for review. This is the legal procedure. The two representatives then took the car back to Shanghai that night. The representatives have now decided to convene a general meeting within the day to discuss the next steps.</p>

<h3>Peng, District Chief of the Second District of Shanghai County, Requests the Merger of Townships</h3>
<p>Peng Zhaotang, the district chief of the Second District of Shanghai County, in view of the fact that the townships formerly delineated in the district were too small in area to facilitate development, he specifically drafted a merger plan and submitted it to the district affairs meeting for approval. Yesterday, he had submitted it to the county government and forwarded it to the Department of Civil Affairs for review. The original submission is as follows: I submit a request for the merger of townships to facilitate the progress of autonomy. The number of households in each township in the district was previously divided into townships. There are only about 100 households in each township, or even 60 to 70 households, and it is also a township. There are as many as 58 townships in the entire district, resulting in scattered organization and inconvenient command. Since the district chief took office, he has tried to divide and merge in order to facilitate guidance and supervision. Recently, he was ordered to prepare for the election of townships. Each township should elect at least two township chiefs, two township deputies, three supervisory committee members, and three alternate supervisory committee members. In townships with too small areas and too few households, not only will there be no right to choose, but even if they are barely filled, they will only be empty names. In the future, when the cause of autonomy is gradually carried out, it will inevitably be impossible to carry out. Now, I would like to submit the merger plan for submission to the third district affairs meeting. The reasons for the merger are briefly stated as follows: (1) There are too many townships in the entire district, and it is inconvenient for the district office to command and supervise. If you want to go to each township to inspect and guide, it will take one day for each township, and the week will take two months. The time is too uneconomical, and it is not easy to convene the district affairs meeting. Moreover, there are too many people and complex opinions, and it is difficult to discuss matters. This is the first reason why the merger should be carried out. (2) There are too few households and a lack of talent in a township. There is a feeling that there is no one to choose for elections. There is a concern that no one can handle things when handling affairs. This is the second reason why the merger should be carried out. (3) Township is the basic organization for autonomy. Now the complete county organization implements local autonomy. Its significance is not only to make the autonomous group an administrative organization, but also to make it an economic organization in order to develop rural undertakings, increase production, and solve the people's livelihood problems. If the township area is too small and there are too few households, the talent and financial resources will be lacking, and the economic organization will not be able to develop. This is the third reason why the merger should be carried out. Now, a list of the townships that should be merged and those whose names should be corrected is shown for reference. I hereby submit the petition for your review and ask you to forward it to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval as soon as possible, so that you can start to carry out the township elections and complete the organization. This is a public convenience.</p>

<h3>Record of the Chinese Medicine Trade Association Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ Resolution to Petition Various Agencies</p>
<p>Riri News reported that the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Trade Association, in order to request the legal revocation of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union and the ordered modification of labor-management conditions, specially convened an extraordinary emergency meeting of the Executive Committee yesterday afternoon. In addition to the entire Executive Committee, a large number of members attended and listened. The above two cases were discussed in great detail. It was then resolved to publicly elect Zhuang Meitang and four other committee members as representatives to petition various agencies, including the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The petition is as follows: (1) Petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters and Municipal Chamber of Commerce, submitted to promptly request the revocation of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union and to request clear instructions. The association previously believed that pharmaceutical store employees, being merchants, should legally elect representatives to join the trade association and should not form a workers' union, which would violate regulations and disrupt the organization. Moreover, the honorable association had appointed Zhao Zhenhui and others, who have long been unemployed, to separately form a Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, causing confusion among the association's members. Therefore, on the 24th of last month, a petition was prepared to the honorable association, requesting a clear explanation. However, more than ten days have passed since the submission, and the honorable association has not yet clearly indicated the reasons for the separate formation of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union. Upon reviewing today's newspaper, the Central Committee's 131st Standing Committee decided on separate organizational methods for medical groups, stating that pharmaceutical merchants and pharmaceutical workers should organize a pharmaceutical trade association in accordance with the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, but workers in pharmaceutical factories may organize a workers' union in accordance with the Labor Union Law. Based on this resolution of the Central Committee, the pharmaceutical store employees in this city should definitely not form another workers' union, which is even clearer. Moreover, the Chinese medicine industry has no pharmaceutical factories, and it is even more impermissible to falsely borrow excuses to arbitrarily form another workers' union, destroying the organization of commercial associations. Therefore, a special document is prepared and submitted, earnestly requesting that the honorable association, in accordance with the Central Committee's resolution and the industrial and commercial regulations, promptly order the revocation of the newly formed Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to rectify public opinion and emphasize organization, and still request that the reasons for the separate formation of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union be clearly explained to dispel public doubts. (2) Petition to the Social Bureau, submitted to promptly request the modification of labor-management conditions in this industry in accordance with the Central Committee's instructions, in order to alleviate the suffering of merchants. The association previously believed that the case of modifying labor-management conditions instructed by the Central Executive Committee has been delayed for more than half a year, causing great anxiety and tension among the members. Therefore, on the 26th of last month, representatives Zhuang Meitang and 19 others were publicly elected to petition the honorable bureau. The bureau's secretary, Zhang Zhenliao, replied that he was instructed by the director to request the representatives to be patient during the period of union reorganization, and that the bureau would properly resolve this case ten days later. Now, more than ten days have passed since Mr. Zhang's appointment, and the honorable bureau must have already had a solution for modifying labor-management conditions in this case. Therefore, representatives are again being sent to the honorable bureau to inquire, earnestly requesting that the honorable bureau promptly handle the matter to maintain credibility.</p>
<h3>Delays in Siberian Mail</h3>
<p>▲ Occurred Before Reception by the Chinese Post Office</p>
<p>Regarding the delay in mail from Siberia, it is now learned from the Shanghai Postal Authority that all mail in Manchuria, Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Nanjing was sent as soon as it arrived.

<h3>The Shaanxi Disaster Relief Emergency Association Will Continue to Hold a Full Committee Meeting Today</h3>
<p>▲ Announcing Fundraising to All Sectors</p>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Emergency Relief Association for the Shaanxi Disaster received a telegram from the Shaanxi Relief Association: (1) To General Zhu Ziqiao of the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association, Wang Yiting, and the benevolent elders Cha Mianzhong and Sun Longji: All Jiangzhi's telegrams have been respectfully noted. Zhizhi telegraphed Elders Wang and Zhu, hoping for your kind attention. The Shaanxi disaster is severe, and spring relief is extremely urgent. Your benevolence in forming an emergency relief association in Shanghai is immeasurable and deeply moving. Sincerely, Ma One. (2) To all benevolent elders of the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Emergency Association: Reading the telegrams of Elders Cha and Sun, Jiangzhi, is a source of great joy. Your compassion for the Shaanxi disaster in forming an emergency relief association, expanding publicity, and broadly raising relief funds to save the remnants is deeply moving to the people of Shaanxi, who will never forget it. A telegram is sent to express gratitude, hoping for your kind attention, Ma Two. The association is scheduled to hold its second plenary committee meeting today (Monday) at 2:00 PM at the Renji Charity Hall to discuss fundraising methods. All committee members have been notified.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for the Shaanxi Disaster issued a notice to all sectors yesterday, stating that the disaster in Shaanxi is extraordinarily severe, unprecedented in history. For four years, there has been no harvest, and the number of deaths has reached over two million. The tragic situation of displacement cannot be fully described in writing. It is the largest and most serious disaster area in China today. In recent years, the government and society have each provided funds for relief, but the disaster area is too wide and the number of victims too large, making it difficult to provide thorough relief. Last year, the great philanthropist Mr. Zhu Ziqiao raised a large sum of money and personally went to distribute relief, traveling to Shaanxi three times and saving many victims. However, the disaster is still severe. At this time of spring plowing when crops are scarce, relief is extremely urgent. Therefore, Mr. Zhu Ziqiao resolutely came to Shanghai to plead for the eight million people of Shaanxi. We, residing in a peaceful land, deeply lament the suffering of our compatriots in Shaanxi and are heartbroken. Therefore, we have initiated the Shanghai Fundraising Emergency Relief for the Shaanxi Disaster (borrowing the venue from the Renji Charity Hall on Yunnan Road), raising donations for one month, hoping to raise a large sum and ask Mr. Zhu Ziqiao to take it to Shaanxi Province to distribute emergency relief. We earnestly request all benevolent people, elders, sisters, and brothers at home and abroad, who are always enthusiastic and particularly chivalrous, to generously donate as much as possible. Saving one life is better than building a seven-story pagoda. We sincerely pray for your blessings.</p>
<h3>The Jisheng Association Continues Relief for the Wugong Disaster</h3>
<p>Burying the Dead and Distributing Seeds</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association received a telegram from the Shaanxi Jisheng Branch, stating that over 160 villages in the towns of Wugong and Zhizhen have suffered complete land abandonment and collapsed houses. There are no plowing cattle or farming tools, and there is no hope for the wheat harvest. Before winter, the county had only over 70,000 disaster victims.

<h3>Case of Vietnamese Police Injuring a Worker</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau is Still Negotiating</p>
<p>Riri News reported that on the 28th of last month, Annamese (Vietnamese) police officers from the French Concession Grand Clock Tower police station, driving a motorized vehicle, carelessly injured a Chinese dockworker named Jiang Agan near the Nan Shi Customs, causing serious injuries to his left hand and both feet. A patrolman from the First District Public Security Bureau arrested the Vietnamese police officers and immediately escorted them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. When the French police station heard of this, they requested extradition from the Public Security Bureau, volunteering to punish them. The bureau put forward four conditions: (1) Bear the medical expenses of the injured worker. (2) Compensate for all relevant losses. (3) If the injured worker dies or becomes disabled, provide sufficient compensation. (4) Submit the judgment on the punishment of the Vietnamese police officers who caused the accident to the Public Security Bureau for review. The police station agreed to all conditions, and the Public Security Bureau granted extradition. Since then, many days have passed, and the police station has not made any inquiries. The Public Security Bureau believes that the injured worker's injuries have not improved, and medical expenses and compensation have not been paid. The worker's family of several relies on him for a living, and after the injury, the family has no means of support. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau sent another letter to the French police station, negotiating for compensation for losses, to maintain diplomatic relations.</p>

<h3>Woman in Moon Palace Suicide Case Also Departs the World</h3>
<p>▲Five Torn and Scattered Love Letters</p>
<p>▲Clues Can Be Found Within</p>
<p>Two People Agreed to Commit Suicide</p>
<p>Were They Both Employees of the Ministry of Communications?</p>
<p>The circumstances of the suicide of a man and a woman by poison at the Moon Palace Hotel have been detailed in yesterday's newspaper. The woman, Bian Juefei, was sent to the hospital, but could not be saved and died yesterday afternoon. She followed her male companion, Ma Yusun, to the afterlife, fulfilling their so-called "true meaning of love." The bodies of the man and woman will be examined this morning. However, the deceased left behind several love letters in the room before their death, which were found yesterday by Zhou Xingwu, an investigator at the Moon Palace Hotel. The letters were torn to pieces and the handwriting was very潦草. Although the words are jumbled, the meaning can still be deciphered. The letters are transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>··············</p>
<p>I see you leading this difficult life, and I am worried about your future. I feel that when you are bored, reading books and taking walks are many times better than doing things that strain your mind and energy. Even if you are invited by friends, I think it is okay to decline. Perhaps my words are too direct, but please forgive me as I am fulfilling my duty as a friend. (Ministry of Communications Stationery)</p>
<p>················</p>
<p>Yesterday's incident startled you, and I am deeply saddened. Please forgive me for my hasty actions. At the same time, because we are too close, we inevitably have conflicting thoughts. Let's let the past be the past. I will never dare to anger you again. Yesterday, I saw Kang's attitude, as if you didn't get a raise. However, you should give two weeks' notice before resigning, to prepare for rest. I wish you a speedy recovery. Sheng. (Ministry of Communications Stationery)</p>
<p>·················</p>
<p>Please don't blame me if my words are excessive. My knowledge and experience are too shallow. My current thoughts are all focused on you and your plans. My expectations for myself are that I will never let you down in the future. Today, your enthusiasm for me has suddenly decreased several times. Why?</p>
<p>·················</p>
<p>You understand all my pain. You are my only source of spiritual comfort. If I achieve final victory in the future, and if you still do not abandon me, I will sacrifice the two crystallizations of our wrongs. We will be eternal intellectual companions. As for adornment, I think simplicity is best. Ordinary women live for others, but I am not like that. Why should I adorn myself to please others?</p>
<p>·············</p>
<p>My dearest Xi, tomorrow is a holiday, and I cannot see you for a day, so I am sending my spirit to your room to accompany you. Regarding this morning's suggestion, I think that if you commit suicide for me and I die for you, it is the price of true love. I am not afraid of people's disapproval, nor am I afraid of their curses. Xi, if I change my mind in the slightest, may heaven and earth not tolerate me, and may the gods inflict the most severe punishment upon me. Think less, eat more. I didn't rummage through your things. Maybe the day after tomorrow. Good night. Chen. (Ministry of Communications Stationery)</p>
<p>···············</p>
<p>There were five letters in total, three of which were written on Ministry of Communications stationery. The handwriting seems to be from two people, suggesting that the man and woman exchanged secret letters frequently. The last letter clearly shows that both parties agreed to commit suicide. Furthermore, judging from the tone of the letters, the man and woman must have seen each other daily or even worked in the same office. The second sentence of the second letter says, "Tomorrow is a holiday, and I cannot see you for a day," which must refer to the Sunday holiday. The so-called "maybe the day after tomorrow" must refer to Monday. According to the Moon Palace Hotel's guest registration book, the two arrived in Shanghai on March 3rd, which was Tuesday. It is likely that they decided to come to Shanghai to commit suicide the day after meeting on Monday. None of the above five letters have names, but the second and fifth letters end with "Sheng" and "Chen" respectively, and the recipient of the last letter is Xi. These may be the real names and secret nicknames of the two. In addition, an envelope was also found, which was also torn to pieces. After piecing it together, it seems to be addressed to "Tang Lengjun, Room Upstairs." The envelope also has the words "Ministry of Communications" on it.</p>
<h3>Two Major Cases Solved by the Second District General Office</h3>
<p>▲Four Thieves on Fangxie Road Captured Without a Single One Escaping</p>
<p>▲Robbers on Xieshi Road Opened Fire to Resist Arrest</p>
<p>Two robbery cases occurred in the Nanshi Second District General Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau last night and this morning. Both cases were thwarted due to the district's thorough defense. As a result, the robbers in both cases were apprehended on the spot, and the stolen goods were recovered. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>▲Fangxie Road At approximately 8:00 to 8:30 PM last night, Song Chunwu, a police officer on duty at Post No. 24, Dajilu, Nanshi Second District General Office, was approached by a panicked young man who said that a robbery had occurred at No. 2, Gongxingli, Fangxie Road, and requested immediate arrest. Officer Song immediately reported to the Second District General Office by telephone. Upon receiving the report, District Chief Wang immediately dispatched Inspectors Gao Ziqiang and Niu Yulin, along with senior officers Liu Jingbo, Zhou Anren, Yang Baolin, Liu Busheng, Wu Yansheng, Dong Fengshan, Zhang Shusheng, Wang Yinzhu, etc., fully armed, to rush to the scene in automobiles. Upon arriving at the destination, the informant led them to Gongxingli. Inspectors Gao and Niu immediately ordered the house to be surrounded and then personally supervised the police to rush in. They first captured a thief who was acting as a lookout. The thief attempted to raise a gun to resist, but the gun was old and rusty, and the bullet could not be fired. The police bravely rushed upstairs, unaware that there were still three thieves upstairs. They had already taken out clothes, silverware, and various stolen goods from the boxes and were in the process of packing them when the police rushed in and captured them all. They also seized a handgun loaded with live ammunition. They then took the victim and all the stolen goods to the station. After questioning by Chief Wang, the victim identified himself as Shen Xingzhuang, 55 years old, a local resident who works as a telegraph receiver at the Great Northern Telegraph Bureau. Because today (the 7th) is my (Shen's own statement) mother's 80th birthday, many relatives and friends came to congratulate us. The guests had just left in the evening, and the family was having dinner when four robbers suddenly arrived. Two robbers held guns, threatening us to remain silent. One robber was downstairs as a lookout, and three robbers went upstairs to search and rob. Fortunately, my son was alert and escaped over the neighboring roof from the曬台, and went out to report the police. He identified the four captured men as the robbers who committed the robbery. Chief Wang continued to examine the two seized handguns, one being an old-fashioned 8-inch Browning No. 2910 with two rounds of ammunition, and the other being a 6-inch Five Phoenix Dragon Tiger Festival Revolver without any bullets. He then continued to question the four robbers. One identified himself as Zhou Baokui, the lookout, 26 years old, from Wuxi, currently residing at No. 49, Guangdong Street, Gaochangmiao, and working as a worker at the Jiangnan Shipyard. One identified himself as Zhang Miaoquan (nickname Little Tofu), 21 years old, a local resident residing at No. 27, Shuanglong Street, Gaochangmiao, also working as a worker at the arsenal. One identified himself as Shen Kun, 25 years old, a local resident currently residing in a bungalow at Wulibqiao, Jumen Road, unemployed. One identified himself as Zhou Yunting, 22 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at the home of a friend surnamed Shang in Gaochangmiao. All confessed to robbing the Shen family. After questioning, Chief Wang immediately transcribed the confessions in detail and will submit them to the judicial section for review today.</p>
<p>▲Xietu Road At approximately 4:30 AM this morning, Yang Guhe and Wang Yuting, police officers on duty at the Nanshi Second District General Office, were on duty near Jumen Road when a person resembling a scavenger rushed up to them and reported that a robbery had occurred at the彌陀庵 Temple on Xietu Road, west of here. The robbers were still looting and had not yet escaped. The two police officers immediately ran to report to the Liyuan Road Substation. Upon receiving the report, Inspector Wang Shensan immediately supervised all the senior officers to rush to the scene armed. However, before they arrived, Patrol Chief Liu Fuxian happened to be passing by on patrol. One of the police officers reported to him. At the same time, the robbers had finished robbing and were escaping with the stolen goods. Patrol Chief Liu immediately drew his gun and gave chase. At this time, Inspector Wang also arrived and joined the chase. Unexpectedly, one of the robbers turned around and opened fire to resist arrest. Police officer Lin Xingquan also returned fire with two shots. The robbers then scattered and fled. As a result, one robber was intercepted and arrested, and a large amount of stolen goods was found. The person and the stolen goods were taken to the station and transferred to the Second District General Office. Chief Wang was excited and began the preliminary interrogation. He also ordered the police to investigate the尼庵. The temple is located at No. 293, Xieshi Road. The house has five rooms on the front and two wings. According to the old nun Baolian, the abbess, at approximately 4:30 AM this morning, several robbers wearing black cotton robes and呢帽, speaking with a 江北accent, rushed up the west staircase, each holding handguns and sharp weapons. They first searched my bedroom for a long time and robbed me of more than thirty yuan in silver, ninety thousand copper coins, and a gold-filled watch. They also injured my left eye and left calf. Then they broke into the back room, where a woman named Tao Wang was living to recover from illness (a local resident, 45 years old, currently residing at No. 1, Renshouli, Zhaizhi Road, French Concession). She was robbed of a 1,000 yuan savings certificate from the Salt Industry Bank, Wang Fuji Account, a 700 yuan savings certificate from the Zhejiang Bank, Wang Fuji Account, more than a hundred yuan in silver, and eleven cotton quilts, leather jackets, etc. The robbery lasted for about half an hour before they left. After investigation, the senior officers brought two young nuns from the temple, Jingxiu and Changgeng, to the district to identify the robbers, which they did without error. Chief Wang then interrogated the suspect strictly. The suspect confessed to the name of Wu Huanting and admitted to organizing the robbery. He also confessed that his accomplices were hiding at No. 1147, Zhangjia Hongbang. Chief Wang then ordered the police to arrest the suspect's wife, Wu Li (28 years old, from Gaoyou, residing at No. 11, Zhoujiadu), Shan Yousheng (27 years old, from Yancheng), Shan Jinsheng (24 years old, from Yancheng), and a woman named Zhang Gu (27 years old, from Yancheng). They also found a 1,000 yuan savings certificate from the Salt Industry Bank, a gold-filled watch, five one-yuan bills, six yuan in silver, a leather wallet, 1,370 copper coins, nine auxiliary currency coupons, and four雙毫coins on the suspect's wife, Wu Li. There was a lot of original stolen goods. Because the evidence was conclusive, Chief Wang immediately recorded the confession in detail and plans to submit it to the judicial section for punishment today along with the case of the robbers on Fangxie Road last night.</p>
<h3>Hong Shen Not Prosecuted by the High Court</h3>
<p>▲Disposition Order Has Been Delivered to Mr. Hong</p>
<p>The Staff Office of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Hankou found that Hong Shen, a professor at Fudan University and Jinan University, was suspected of promoting Communism. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Justice, ordering the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to issue an arrest warrant. When Hong learned of this, he hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng and went to the General Patrol Room to surrender himself. He was then sent to the High Court by the Western Detective Chief, where the Chief Prosecutor of the court opened an investigation and issued an order pending a decision. Hong, through his representative lawyer Zhan Jifeng, requested bail, as reported previously. It is now known that the Chief Prosecutor of the court concluded the investigation yesterday and determined that there was insufficient evidence of Hong's crime and decided not to prosecute. The order of non-prosecution has been delivered to Mr. Hong.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers of Dangzhuang Village, Suzhou, Captured in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Five Robbers Arrested in Two Hotels</p>
<p>▲The Young Hostage Is Still Missing</p>
<p>Zhang's five-year-old son, Sifu, from Dangzhuang Village, Suzhou, was suddenly kidnapped by robbers on January 27, who demanded a ransom of 10,000 yuan. Zhang specially sent Wang Qianglin to Shanghai with a letter from the robbers to negotiate. They had already made contact twice and paid more than 1,000 yuan, but the amount was still far apart, so Wang had not yet met the child. The other day, Liu Chunshu, a detective from the Zhabei Patrol Room, captured five robbers from Suzhou, Chen Rongfa, Sun Xiaodi, Zhang A'gen, Li Huibao, and Zhang A'liu, in the Luming Hotel on Fuzhou Road and the Pujiang Hotel on Fujian Road. It was found that they were the ones who kidnapped Zhang's son. They were then sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Zhou interrogated them and ordered them to be detained pending the arrest of all the accomplices and the recovery of the hostage before proceeding with the trial.</p>
<h3>Three Suspects in the Xu Guisheng Assassination Case Released</h3>
<p>▲All Proved to Have No Connection by Others</p>
<p>▲Further Prosecution Will Be Pursued If Evidence Is Found</p>
<p>Xu Guisheng, manager of the Wuhua Refining and Dyeing Company in Zhabei, was murdered in his bedroom in the middle of the night, and 3,400 yuan was stolen from the room. Subsequently, the police arrested Zhou A'wu, a shop worker from the company, and Zhao Ruixing, an apprentice. Based on Zhao's confession, they arrested Zhang Genhe (also known as Zhu Shaochuan), Ding A'san (also known as Kong Mingyue), and Xu Tongsheng (also known as Zhao Jinghua) in the Public Concession and sent them to the 持區 Local Court, ordering Zhou A'wu to be brought to court to testify. This has been reported previously. The other day, Judge Feng continued the hearing. The Public Security Bureau brought Zhou to court, and the defendants also invited witnesses to court to prove that Zhao Ruixing had falsely accused them. According to Zhou A'wu's testimony, he was from Dongting Mountain, 37 years old, and worked as a tea server at Wuhua. He did not know who the murderer of Manager Xu was. Zhao Ruixing said that I killed him, which is a false accusation. On the morning of the incident, at about 7:00 AM, I and another apprentice entered the accounting room to clean. Suddenly, I saw a silver dollar placed on the silver box, which was very strange. I approached the box and saw that the lid was open. I did not have time to check the contents of the box and rushed to the manager's office to report to Mr. Xu, but there was no response. I turned on the electric light and saw that the cotton quilt covering Mr. Xu was stained with blood. I lifted the quilt and saw that Xu had been killed. I quickly returned to the outer accounting room to report. This is what I saw. Judge Feng ordered him to identify Zhang, Ding, and Xu as the murderers. Zhou looked at them one by one and said that he did not know any of them. Next, a Westerner, Qiamu, from the 工部局 Sanitation Department, testified that Xu Tongsheng had been working as a servant at the Sanitation Department for two years and always slept in the office and never stayed out overnight. Xu's colleague, Wang Daming, testified that Xu slept with him on the night of the incident and did not get up until 7:00 AM the next morning. Hou Youqing, the owner of the Xiangxing Machinery Store, testified that Ding A'san and others were his employees and had asked for leave to return to Wuxi on the day of the incident. Judge Feng believed that, according to the testimony of the witnesses, it was sufficient to show that Zhao Ruixing's confession was false and could not be believed. Therefore, he ordered Xu and the other two to be released on bail and informed Gu Liancheng, the representative from the Public Security Bureau, that if there was any concrete evidence against these three in the future, they could still be brought forward for questioning.</p>
<h3>Municipal Funds to Purchase the Dahua Hotel</h3>
<p>▲Director of the 工部局 Says Consent of Chinese Residents Must Be Obtained</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the issue of municipal funds to purchase the Dahua Hotel was only mentioned and not considered at the 工部局 Board of Directors meeting last Wednesday. It is reported that the matter had been discussed by the Public Works Committee, but no consensus was reached. When the case was brought to the Board of Directors meeting, everyone said that the opinions of Chinese residents must be sought first before any practical steps could be taken. Therefore, they asked the Chinese directors to pay special attention to the discussion of the Public Works Committee and to seek the opinions of Chinese residents.</p>
<h3>Municipal Ferry from Donggou Extends to Gaoqiao</h3>
<p>▲Starts on the 11th of This Month</p>
<p>▲Simultaneously, the Gaoqiao Town Side</p>
<p>▲Has Public Buses Connecting</p>
<p>The municipal ferry originally only ran from the Bund Tongren Pier on Nanjing Road to Donggou in Pudong. The municipal authorities believed that Gaoqiao was the northernmost and most remote area of Pudong and that it was most inconvenient to travel to and from other areas. The traffic problem must be solved in order to promote its development. People in Gaoqiao had also repeatedly expressed the hope that the municipal ferry would extend to the town. Therefore, the Public Utilities Bureau planned to extend the route from Donggou to Gaoqiao and built two large and beautiful ferries (namely, the第天號 and the 第四號), each divided into three floors. The front of the upper floor is a special class cabin with seats for 40 people. The entire middle floor is a first-class cabin with seats for 160 people. The lower floor is a second-class cabin with a capacity of 300 people. The cushions and backrests are extremely comfortable. Outside the cabin, there are ingeniously designed tea drinking utensils and clean toilets. The rear of the middle floor also has a wide space for luggage and cargo. For the convenience of passengers getting on and off,</p>
<p>A Solid and Flat Floating Pier was built on the Gaoqiao side, 24.4 meters long and 6.1 meters wide, surrounded by steel plates, rising and falling with the tide. A floating bridge connects it to the shore. Passengers can board and disembark safely without any danger. A consumption社 will be set up on the pier to allow passengers to buy goods or exchange silver. However, the large boats and small ports cannot approach the town, so the pier is one kilometer away from the town. In order to compensate for this shortcoming, the bureau purchased</p>
<p>Two Wide and Stable Public Buses to run exclusively on the section from the pier to Gaoqiao Town, picking up and dropping off passengers. Each bus can seat 35 people. Its construction and layout are comparable to the best public buses in Shanghai. Passengers riding in them will surely enjoy the pleasure of the open air and the scenery of the river. It is now heard that</p>
<p>The Ferry from Donggou to Gaoqiao is scheduled to start on March 11. There will be 28 runs daily from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM. The ferry arrives at Gaoqiao every 20 minutes and departs every 30 minutes. In Shanghai, the ferry departs every hour. The one-way fare is 4.2 角 for special class, 2.8 角 for first class, and 1.4 角 for second class. It is also heard that all one-way tickets sold for Gaoqiao to various piers and from various piers to Gaoqiao within three days from the start date can be used for round trips as a preferential treatment. As for the public buses connecting to the ferry in Gaoqiao Town,华商 Public Buses are currently being borrowed and will also start running on the same day.</p>
<h3>Chi Zhusun, Who Lost Money Running a Leather Shoe Store, Attempted Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>▲Life Is Very Dangerous</p>
<p>Chi Zhusun, 29 years old from Wenzhou, is a Christian and a graduate of Chengtian English School, so he has a good command of English. He lives at No. 38, Qiujiangli, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, and works as a manager at the Zhonghua Leather Shoe Company on Nanjing Road. He has been there for several years and is highly valued by the company. Two years ago, several friends negotiated to establish the Asia Leather Shoe Company opposite the Zhonghua Leather Shoe Company and appointed Chi Zhusun as the manager. Unfortunately, fate was not on his side. After being open for more than a year, it lost tens of thousands of dollars and went bankrupt. Subsequently, Zhonghua rehired Chi as a manager. Another year passed quickly. Recalling the huge loss, which caused him to accumulate a lot of debt, he was extremely depressed. Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, he asked for leave from the company and returned home. His wife took the children to church. Chi took the opportunity to secretly drink安神绵水 to commit suicide. After taking it, he fell asleep in bed. Before long, the poison took effect, and he groaned uncontrollably. His brother, Chi Fangsun (18 years old, studying at the Southeast Medical University of the Army Nursing Camp in Nanshi), visited and saw the situation and saw a bottle of 安神药水 on the table. He knew that his brother had taken poison and rushed him to the Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that his life is in great danger.</p>
<h3>A Wealthy Merchant in the Pawn Industry Was Kidnapped on Shantou Road This Morning</h3>
<p>▲A洋囡囡 Brothel Hosts a Big Affair</p>
<p>▲Partying Ends in Tragedy</p>
<p>A wealthy merchant surnamed Chen in the pawn industry hosted a banquet for more than a dozen guests at a 洋囡囡 brothel, No. 29, Yanqunfang, Shantou Road, last night. The brothel was full of beautiful women and music, with countless flower baskets on display. Mr. Chen was in high spirits. The banquet ended at 12:15 AM. The guests said goodbye one after another. Mr. Chen also stepped out. His private car, No. 四六三三, was parked on Shantou Road, facing west. Chen reached the car, and the driver's assistant opened the door for him. Chen got into the car, and the chauffeur in the front was stepping on the engine, preparing to start.

Yesterday, they were summoned again. The defendant's representative, lawyer Plamier, stated that the cause of this case was that the first defendant, Volkova's husband, had a tooth extracted at the plaintiff's office. Due to the plaintiff's poor surgery, the pus from a facial abscess was mistakenly injected into the blood vessels of the tooth, which rushed into the brain, leading to fatal meningitis. Therefore, the defendant was angry and published a statement in the newspaper. This is freedom of speech and the facts are true and cannot be considered defamation. As for the second and third defendants, they published the news based on the submitted manuscript, which was signed by the person responsible for the manuscript. There was no collusion to damage reputation. He requested a clear investigation. Judge Zhu ordered them to leave and wait for further review.</p>

<h3>Zhenru Wins Right to Advanced Cup Football Final</h3>
<p>▲Won Against Shanghai Team Two to One Yesterday</p>
<p>｜Last Five Minutes Turned into a Tie｜</p>
<p>｜Thirty Minutes of Extra Time to Overcome the Enemy｜</p>
<p>｜More Than Eight Thousand Fans Went Crazy｜</p>
<p>The spring is warm, and the spring is full of earth. It is good weather for football games. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Zhenru football team eliminated the Shanghai team by two to one at the Shenyuan football field in this sunny and warm weather, winning the right to the Advanced Cup final. Zhenru was defeated as soon as the game started, and it was not until the last five minutes that it turned into a tie. Thirty minutes of extra time were needed to overcome the enemy. Eight thousand fans were crazy about it. Strange things are also happy things.</p>

<h3>Victory or Defeat Also Has Luck and Misfortune</h3>
<p>Zhenru eliminated the Navy, and the Shanghai team defeated Huasesi. The two teams met to compete for the right to the final. In terms of strength, they were about the same. The Shanghai team's defenders were all famous generals, but since Bao Deheng left, Ke Erqiao, Baikesituo, etc. were also absent, and the forwards were slightly affected. Zhenru's biggest concern was Xie Quanhe, and the two wings also lacked response. Therefore, the overall situation was even at the beginning. Shanghai scored a goal in the first five minutes, and Xie Quanhe should be fully responsible. It is also inexplicable that the game turned into a tie in the last five minutes. Both teams failed to score three or four times. Yesterday's victory or defeat was probably due to luck and misfortune. However, the Shanghai team was exhausted, while Zhenru was serving in the International Race the day before. This is strange.</p>
<h3>A Slip Could Have Led to Eternal Regret</h3>
<p>The referee North blew the whistle to start the battle. The Shanghai team attacked first. Chen Zhenhe, the main brain of the entire army, ordered a counterattack, approaching the enemy's goal and getting a free kick, and then a corner kick, but they were unsuccessful. The Westerners gained momentum and also launched an offensive, directly knocking on the military gate. Thirty yards from the goal, they took a free kick, which was unsuccessful and became a corner kick. It was transferred away, and the ball fell on the left winger Yi Wen's foot. He shot far away, and Tan Quanhe did not know what to do, so he let him score. This was only five minutes after the start of the game. This light ball almost determined Zhenru's fate. After this, Zhenru counterattacked for ten minutes without any effect. If Fu Hexuan had not broken through the door in the last five minutes, Zhenru would have been finished.</p>
<h3>Black Coal's Charge Was Calculated by the Enemy</h3>
<p>After Zhenru lost this goal, the crowd did not take it seriously at first. After repeated attacks were returned, they gradually became anxious. Dai Linjing passed the ball to Black Coal, and then to Mei Hongbao. Mei's hook was very effective, falling on Fu Hexuan's foot, but he missed a great opportunity. Then, Mei Hongbao got the ball in front of the goal, but did not attack. Sacrificing like this, the group all sighed. Little Black Coal was extremely angry and rushed forward, but unfortunately, he was calculated by the enemy and fell wounded out of the field. The morale of the army was shaken for a while. Fortunately, he returned to the field with pain. However, Zhenru lost the goal in the first half.</p>
<h3>Another Village Appears After the Willow Trees and Bright Flowers</h3>
<p>Lemon and Zhen Ru cooperated in one go. Mei Hongbao's ball reached the front of the goal, only three feet away. It was a pity he lightly let it pass. Dai Fenyong attacked but missed. Chen Zhenhe's kick fell into the hands of the enemy again. Time flew by, and it was about to end. The counterattack failed and they were burdened by the enemy again. Sinclair charged with his horse until Xie Quanhe rushed out to meet him, but he failed to snatch the ball, not noticing that the goal was empty behind him. It was fortunate that it became a corner kick. The enemy's attack came again. Xie went out again, the ball leaking between his legs and hitting the goalpost. How dangerous! At this point, Zhen Ru's overall situation was gone, and hope was cut off. The spectators began to disperse like birds. Who knew that Heaven would not abandon them? When they were at their wit's end, the path of righteousness was right before them again. Fu Hexuan, amidst the chaos, actually scored a goal, tying the score. A great situation was turned around. How precious and gratifying this goal was! The game ended in a draw.</p>
<h3>Westerners Yield in Extended Match</h3>
<p>With no winner determined, the referee announced an extension of thirty minutes, with the teams changing sides. In the first fifteen minutes, Zhuang Shiming was injured in the face, but fortunately it was not serious. Neither team scored. In the next fifteen minutes, joy descended from heaven for Zhen Ru. The ball came from the center, and with one kick it was passed to the right wing. Both sides advanced, attacking from both the front and the rear. Chen Jiaqiu responded and returned the ball to the center. Center Dai jumped up to head it, but the ball fell behind him. Chen Zhenhe's divine foot rose, and the ball flew into the net! More than eight thousand fans rejoiced like crazy. A two-to-one victory was decided.</p>
<h3>Dong Shouyi and Others Arrive in Jinan</h3>

<h3>Lehua Suffers Another Defeat Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Lost to Haworth Nine to One</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Lehua football team, with a fragmented and disorganized lineup, lost to Haworth by a score of nine to one. Haworth's strength was quite strong. It was not easy for Lehua to obtain this precious goal. Although the lineup was incomplete, the efforts of each player were admirable. In the first half, after Haworth scored two goals, Xi Qiaosheng's pass and Zhou Shaowen's kick were extremely swift and created a one-to-one situation. However, from then on, they plummeted and could not achieve anything. The first half ended three to one. In the second half, almost the entire momentum was with Haworth, and they scored consecutive goals, resulting in a score of nine to one. Haworth won. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<h3>Haworth</h3>
<p>Graham</p>
<p>Kay, Gen, McAtteer, Strong, Sheng</p>
<p>Miles, Ma, Liao, Mo, Fei</p>

Their basketball team played its last game in the Shanghai Basketball Association yesterday, defeating Laoda by a score of 36 to 26. At the start of the game, the Marines' offense was strong, making it difficult for Laoda to support. Later, they struggled hard and the score became 16 to 19, with the Marines leading by three points in the first half. In the second half, the game initially became a stalemate, but Laoda ultimately succumbed and the Marines continued to fight hard, winning 36 to 26. The referee was Shao Ji. In Group B, the evening star versus Friendship team put on a good performance. The evening star's throws were accurate, resulting in a 31 to 19 victory.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Track and Field Team Begins Training</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan track and field team held its first general training session at the China Athletic Field yesterday afternoon. All team members enthusiastically participated. Head coach Rong Zhaozhao and secretary Wang Fudan gave instructions. After 4 o'clock, they gathered at the Xie Jin Association office to discuss everything. Before the competition against Jinan on the 15th, Rong Baizhao gave the following sincere speech to all the athletes:</p>
<p>"Do not engage in intense training during this rest period, to avoid muscle injuries that would affect the entire training period. Therefore, the initial stage should focus on light activity, gradually developing and prioritizing increasing physical strength. Short-distance runners must work hard, using the 400 meters as the foundation, with daily and monthly progress. Invisible progress will increase naturally. Therefore, if the 400-meter result is good, then the 100-meter and 200-meter results will be even better. Thus, initially, one should focus on practicing the 400 meters with full effort, of course not completing the entire distance at first. After a long period of practice, one will surely progress faster and faster, until one can complete the entire distance in under 53 seconds. Once this skill is good and the foundation of short-distance running is solid, those who practice short-distance running can skip practicing the 100 meters and 200 meters. As for starting, it is a small matter. Once there is speed and power, correcting the start will not be a problem. Liu Changchun of the Northeast is a prime example."</p>

<p>▲ A British Army Colonel named Cap. Butle vowed to walk around the world in twelve years. He set off from Canada in 1909 and actually reached South Africa. Later, he had to return home to serve in the military due to the outbreak of the European War, and thus the journey was interrupted.</p>
<p>▲ A British minister named Revhorder is an expert in hymns and therefore specializes in collecting printed copies of hymns from all over the world. He has everything. Over the years, he has almost filled a room. This man has now passed away.</p>
<p>▲ A kind of rainbow-colored cane and brightly colored leggings were once very popular in the city of Paris. Almost every fashionable man had them in his hands and on his feet.</p>
<p>▲ There are fewer men than women in England who reach the age of one hundred. Most of these elderly women are widows who have not remarried after their husbands died. The reason why they live so long is probably for this reason.</p>
<p>▲ An aviation officer from Dayton, Wahawa, USA, flew to 240 miles away in one hour, breaking the world's flying record.</p>

<h3>A Postscript on the Matter of Sun Meisong Accepting Amnesty</h3>
<p>— Tian Jian</p>
<p>I read in the newspaper recently that the bandit atmosphere in Baodu Ridge has risen again. Sun Meisong, the leader of the bandits, and his gang were once granted amnesty by the authorities last year when the war was tense. They were reorganized into the Twenty-seventh Division, with Sun serving as the commander. He used the name Jingtai at that time. The person sent by the authorities to inspect them was my friend Mr. Cao. Cao was a staff officer in the headquarters. He once told me about the situation when he went to the bandit's den for inspection. It was no different from the actions of the Jianghu bandits in the plays, and it was quite interesting. When Mr. Cao was ordered to go to the bandit's den, he did not take many people with him. They all went on horseback. The bandit's den was in the mountains and ridges, located at the intersection of the five counties of Lin, Tan, Fei, and Yi. The thickets and dense forests made the narrow paths hidden and difficult to explore. Outside the bandit's territory was occupied by the Red Spear Society. Outside the territory occupied by the Red Spear Society was the territory guarded by the militia. At that time, the militia and the Red Spear Society restrained each other, so in form they seemed to be divided and guarded. Mr. Cao and his party were quite frightened before entering the bandit's den. At first, they were shot at by the militia, but they were allowed to pass after explanation. Then, they were shot at by the Red Spear Society. Although they explained, it was slightly more difficult than with the militia. Finally, they reached the bandit's territory, and the bandits seemed to be prepared. They saw shadows of people in the forest, coming and going in twos and threes, as if they were spying. Seeing Cao and the others arrive, they jumped out and asked for their names and reasons for coming. After explaining their purpose, they waved their hats as a salute and led them into a fort. Outside the fort was a wide plain, planted with trees and bamboo, and the scenery was very beautiful. At that time, there were many bandits gathered in front of the fort. Gunshots suddenly rang out. The bandits said that this was the most respectful salute. After they arrived, the bandits all waved their hats as a salute. The situation was very interesting. They dismounted and went inside. The house was very deep and wide. At a gate, dozens of bandits waved their hats. At the fourth or fifth gate, they saw more than ten people standing on the steps, surrounding one person. Cao knew that this person must be Sun. They greeted each other very respectfully. When tea and cigarettes were served, each guest was given two cigarettes. This was also different from ordinary etiquette. When the dishes were served and they gathered for a meal, many of the bandits sat on chairs and ate. This was a daily ritual among the bandits, and sitting to eat would have been impolite. It was also a strange story. Sun laughed and said to Cao during the meal, "I am afraid that many of the rules in our world do not conform to the etiquette of the outside world. I hope you will not be surprised." Cao answered vaguely. Mr. Cao lived in the mountains for several days. Although the food, drink, and living were still comfortable, the gunshots never stopped. The most taboo thing in the den was to hold one's hands behind one's back, as it was considered very unlucky. How long has it been, and Sun and others have suddenly become bandits again. Alas, white clouds and grey dogs, the changes are so great!</p>
<p>Duck King</p>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Australia is a center for duck farming. According to news from Melbourne (New Gold Mountain), Australia and New Zealand recently held a duck egg-laying competition. The winner was an eleven-year-old duck. The duck laid 225 eggs in 220 days, setting a new egg-laying record. The owner was Mr. Clarke, who lives in Mornington. According to him, this duck also had days when it did not lay eggs at all in 220 days. However, there were also many days when it laid two or three eggs a day, so it was able to set a new record.</p>
<h3>Male Models</h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>"Model" has many different interpretations. The most common ones are two kinds. One is a subject exclusively for artists to draw from life. One is a person who wears clothes in a clothing store to show people the styles. These two were originally the profession of women. So when we see the three words "model," we often associate them with everything about women. However, in practice, "model" is a transliteration of the word "model," which is equivalent to the Chinese word "model." Those who are used by artists for drawing from life are not only women, but also men and other animals. However, male models in clothing stores are one of the new businesses in Paris in 1931.</p>
<p>The professions of women in Europe and America are very developed. Restaurants use female waiters. Department stores hire female clerks. It is really very common. According to recent surveys, the total number of female employees in various parts of the United Kingdom (referring only to shops) is 3,474,170, which is more than 500,000 more than in 1923. At the same time, the status of men is getting smaller and smaller. Most of the initiators of various new industries also focus on female employees and take male employees as the exception. Men have gradually lost their importance in society. Generally unemployed men have no way to think. So they had to find another way. Men take the place of everything that modern women are unwilling to do. What has always been considered the vocation of women, "housekeeping," has been mostly done by men in the prosperous cities recently. However, there are more male models in Paris. They try on new clothes and act charming in famous clothing stores to please customers. It is also one of the strange things of 1931.</p>
<h3>A Record of Two Commendable Things</h3>
<p>— Chen Yuanliang</p>
<p>On the first day of this month, the Drunk Dinner Party held an inaugural meeting at the Yuebin Building. I arrived with my companion on time. At that time, all the worthies had arrived. After shaking hands and reminiscing about the past, there was a moment of silence. Only the sound of chewing could be heard. Before the second round of wine, the food was exhausted. Then there was fighting to pay. The lonely atmosphere was broken again. Before long, the cups and plates were in a mess, so they left their seats and paid for the meal. At that time, there was a student from the East China Sea who, in addition to paying the usual fee, added two more yuan and said that the money came from an accident and was specially donated to the association to reward the waiters, which was a highlight of the establishment of our association. Everyone was stunned when they heard this, because they didn't know what was going on. Then the student stood up and said that he was currently employed in a certain bank on Henan Road. This afternoon, he went to a small cigarette paper shop across the street to buy cigarettes. He took out two small silver dollars, got a pack of cigarettes, and returned. Before he had taken a few steps, the apprentice of the shop shouted and returned, handing him back two foreign Buddhas, saying that this was what you left behind, sir. Please accept it. He was very surprised, because he had not touched the ocean when he bought the cigarettes, and only paid the small silver dollars. So he did not accept it and told him the reason. The apprentice replied, "This money was not left behind this time, but the last time. It was left for you." He tried to argue that it was not, but the apprentice insisted that it was. In the end, he did not want to waste more words, lest passers-by become suspicious, so he reluctantly accepted and thanked him. I think this shop probably has a customer whose figure and appearance are similar to his, who left the money behind, causing the apprentice to misidentify him. Such selflessness is really admirable. Therefore, I announced it to everyone, and because the money does not belong to me, I am happy to donate it. After listening to the words, I also remembered that one evening, I hired a streetcar to return to my residence. When I arrived at the entrance of the alley, I paid the fare and jumped out, forgetting to leave half a dozen new Western-style hard collars that I had just bought in the car. So the driver called me back and told me the reason. I appreciated his sincerity and gave him another fee. At that time, I thought that the small collars were not worth much. Once they were lost and recovered, I regarded them as treasures. When I looked back, the paper bag was placed in the car. The driver did not know what it was at first, so I knew that his action was purely sincere and did not take the value of the item as a standard. Therefore, following the student from the East China Sea, I continued to announce it to everyone. Everyone looked solemn and expressed their deep admiration for the apprentice and the driver, saying that they were outstanding figures in modern times.</p>
<h3>Random Talk about Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Xin Wei</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the storytelling venue at the Oriental Hotel in Shanghai, the number of listeners at Changle and other places has decreased. Huiquan Building is still able to maintain its original business. The Oriental Hotel is the most developed. Since last winter, the Far East Hotel has changed to storytelling and costume drama, which is very popular among women, because the words and sentences are simple, the tune is close to Dongxiang, and the tune is equal to the storytelling about cause and effect in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Among the storytellers, Huang Zhaolin's Three Kingdoms is the most substantial. His dedication of the horse, gift of the robe, and killing of generals at five passes have become classics. His portrayal of Guan Gong and Cao Cao is unmatched. Moreover, it cannot be imitated by later generations. His acting skills were inherited from his father, Yongnian. His storytelling is also meticulous and his rules are strictly observed. It is not easy for him to enjoy such a great reputation.</p>
<p>Zhaoxiong is Zhaolin's younger brother. He is especially good at singing and playing the zither. He studied Kunqu Opera for six years, so he is very careful with the words. His pronunciation is accurate and clear, and there are no flowery or greasy tones. He is not the same as those who only try to please the ears with sounds without words. He can be considered the best in storytelling.</p>
<p>Since Ma Rufei, Wei Yuqing is now the best in telling the story of the Pearl Pagoda. Wei's delicate skills are unmatched. The singing is also purely in the Ma style. It is a pity that his breath is insufficient. However, even with this tune, no one can match him. However, with the changing times, Wei's story is indeed the best, but the audience's level is not what it used to be. There are fewer and fewer connoisseurs. It is a pity.</p>
<p>Xue Xiaoqing and Shen Jian'an are one of Wei's apprentices and one of Zhu Jianzhuang's top students. I dare not compliment or criticize their stories. According to people in the industry, Shen and Xue's Pearl Pagoda is an old Pearl Pagoda. It is not as good as Zhong Xiaonong's Pearl Pagoda, which is newer.</p>
<p>Zhu Lan'an and Zhu Ju'an's West Chamber is indeed unique. Li Bokang's Yang Naiwu is also the only one. There is no separation. The two Zhus have patent rights, but their names are not as red as Li's in the storytelling world. This is because Li Bokang's story has many new terms in the words and sentences, and he uses them very well.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaoting's Legend of the White Snake is even better with the help of his son, Shenlin. Xiaoting's storytelling is good and the story is popular. Shenlin's singing is good. He plays the zither and drum very well, which makes people happy to hear.</p>
<p>Since Xie Pinquan was assassinated, Xia Liansheng is now considered the best in telling the story of Three Smiles. Jiang Binchu, Wang Wanxiang, and others can also handle it.</p>
<p>Ye Shengxiang's Legend of Jin Tai can be said to have reached perfection. Shengxiang is proficient in boxing. He can perform several sets of boxing on the stage. Because there are many fights in the Legend of Jin Tai, those who do not know martial arts cannot make it colorful. Shengxiang is proficient in martial arts and is good at storytelling. He is happy but not vulgar. He is the best in the Guangyu Society's short stories.</p>
<h3>Heart's Warmth (378)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: Skillful at Preserving Youth, Emerald Ink Confuses Moth Eyebrows; Unable to Prolong Life, Golden Market for the Bones of Fine Horses</p>
<p>Therefore, Big-Bellied A'jin felt that the opening of Hua Lao Liu's article wasn't very energetic. But she hoped his good writing was still to come. However, his luck with women was truly not good. A month gradually passed. Business was not very prosperous. Of course, it was his bad luck, but his temper also had an impact. Because he could act according to the instincts of young women, he was a bit more welcoming to young guests. Towards guests over forty years old, although he tried his best to be perfunctory, he unconsciously revealed some indifference. With two guests, they went to his place to play cards. The young guest's side would sit a little longer. When slips of paper were put on the table, he would chat and laugh with the young guests. Towards the deaf and mute servant who greeted him, he only had a respectful attitude and didn't talk much. Northerners were the most jealous. Seeing this, they were already unhappy with him. They often said that he liked young, handsome men. He didn't bother to care about that. At this time, the Beijing government was gradually flourishing. Warlords from various provinces were coming and going in an endless stream. After extorting the people's wealth in other provinces, or receiving military pay from the Ministry of Finance, they were squandering it in Beijing. There were also those members of parliament, the national representatives elected from various provinces. They were also indulging in wild prostitution and gambling, living a life of wine, women, and song. Next were the ministers and vice-ministers, whose bribes could also be used to pay for such pleasures to the fullest extent. Although corruption had reached its extreme, those brothel girls extremely welcomed these generous spenders, especially those who were both gamblers and patrons of prostitutes. Because there were some people who had a limit on how they spent money on weekdays, but once they were in a gambling den, there were no limits. Those girls even more hoped that the guests they served would win money. That meant luck had arrived. For example, if a guest suddenly won twenty or thirty thousand, he would immediately give his girl three or five thousand in cash or checks, and leave with her. It wasn't a big deal. Most of these gambling games were in the spacious mansions in the eastern and western parts of Beijing. In the alleys, they called it "going out of the city for slips of paper." When the girls heard about "going out of the city for slips of paper," their faces would light up. They knew that if there was a gambling game that night, there would be a big opportunity. So they would reject all invitations from within the alley that night. If the invitation was returned, saying that so-and-so girl had gone "out of the city for slips of paper," it sounded loud and clear, like a great honor. Some even hired cars to enter the city. The cost of the car was also paid by the host. If the host won, or had extra money, they would distribute two or three hundred yuan to the girls. Hua Lao Liu wanted to meet such a patron after arriving in Beijing. A month later, a bureau chief invited him and became very friendly with him, saying, "Lao Liu, in a few days, I'm going to have guests at my house and invite some friends to gamble. I can give you a cut." Hua Lao Liu was naturally very happy to hear that.</p>

<h3>Gold Bar Market Weakened Last Week</h3>
<p>▲ Situation… Extremely Complex</p>
<p>Last week, the gold bar market fell into a slump again, the state was extremely confusing, and there was a strong change. On Monday, Da Tiao Bank continued to increase by 25 to 1875, the silver price increased by 375, and the exchange rates such as the British exchange remained unchanged. However, the internal market seemed to be loose, and the supply and demand of the industry were inconsistent. Almost four months after the opening of the gold bar market, it rose by two taels to 768.5 taels, because it was rumored that cash had been exported, and news of the implementation of silver tax increases in India, etc., boosted people's confidence, and continued to rise to 74 taels. Suddenly, it was heard that the cash export was returned due to incomplete insurance and customs clearance procedures, so the price plummeted by more than ten taels, only counting 61 taels and 3 qian. The first order was also loose, and because the buyers were overbearing, the exchange market was easier to improve, so it showed a peak, and soared ten taels, and once again exceeded 70 taels. The afternoon was still flat, but the rise and fall were only more than four taels, and the closing price was 70 taels and 2 qian, which was 3 taels and 7 qian higher than last Saturday. The price difference between the before and after markets was 12 taels and 7 qian. The next day, Da Tiao fell back to 125 to 0625, the silver price fell by 375, and the first order was flat inside and strong outside. The initial opening of the gold bar market was high at 74 taels and 3 qian, and then it was 77 taels, but the big players sold off, depreciating by 7 taels, and the noon closing price was 70 taels and 2 qian. In the afternoon, the price rose and fell by only 3 taels, and the market situation was peaceful. The final result was 72 taels and 9 qian, which rose by another 2 taels and 7 qian. The whole day only had a rise and fall of 7 taels and 2 qian. On Wednesday, it suddenly showed fatigue, and the opening price fell to 70 taels and 5 qian. Then Da Tiao slightly fell, and the silver market did not change. Then the first order and other things tended to be short, and the first number was sold after the settlement. Especially because rumors were rampant, cash was stopped, and China and the United States borrowed money that could be made, etc., people were panicked, and most of the floating buyers tended to sell off, so the price plummeted by 20 taels, and the noon closing price was 52 taels and 5 qian. The afternoon was even more decadent, breaking 50 taels, and the closing price was 49 taels and 2 qian, which was a sharp drop of 23 taels and 7 qian compared with the previous day. The next day, Da Tiao grew by 25, and the silver market increased by 625, but the first order initially grew by one and a half gears (375), and the afternoon changed to half a gear (125). The internal results still showed a slight contraction, and each number was thrown first and then stripped. Almost the gold market opened at a high price, because the foot ground had no changes, and history was bought by Zhifeng Yongding Changyuansheng and others, which was 51 taels and a half. After that, the rise and fall were impermanent, and the closing price fell to 53 taels and 5. In the afternoon, there was a sudden flight Meng Jin, because it was heard that cash will be opened in the middle of this month, and it is also rumored that a certain bank absorbed more than 3,000 cash bars, which boosted people's confidence, and even rose to 66 taels and a half. The closing price was 65 taels and 6 qian, which was 16 taels and 4 qian higher than the previous day. On Friday, Da Tiao grew by another 125 to 1875, the silver price increased by 25, and the first order grew by half a gear. Both Ming and An were decadent, and the hedging house threw out more than 400,000 pounds. The metallurgical market opened at a low price, counting 58 taels. After that, the big households had different people coming in and out, which made the price confusing. At noon, only 39 taels were counted, because Wu sold it, and the first order was not easy to sell at 130625. Then the buying power seemed to be more, and the closing price rose to 42 taels and 8 qian. In the afternoon, it was initially stable and then weak. The Indian exchange rate reported a big drop, and the bank did the first order 13125, so it fell to 36 taels and 3 qian. Suddenly the buyers started to move, rising to 42 taels and a half. The closing price was still soft at 37 taels, which was a tragic drop of more than 28 taels and 6 qian compared with the previous day. On Saturday, Da Tiao continued to grow by 3125, the American silver increased by 625, and the first order grew by one gear. However, the internal market seemed to be stable, and Chinese businessmen still had to throw it out. Almost the gold price initially rose to 43 taels, then to 46 taels and 3 qian, and then there was a slight fluctuation, hovering outside of 40 taels. After ten o'clock, the air was bad, and the first order was extremely hard to sell at 131875, and the big households competed to sell, falling by more than ten taels. At eleven o'clock, it was 32 taels and a half, and in a blink of an eye, it was stable, exceeding 40 taels. Then Hengxing and others rushed in, and the first order turned better, and the noon rose to 45 taels. It soared ten taels in half an hour, and the noon closing price was 42 taels and a half, which was 5 taels and 5 qian higher than the previous day. Now, the high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver markets and bill bar markets are described separately below.</p>

<h3>The Money Industry Will Open the Noon Market Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the money industry on the 19th of last month, although it seems to be trading as usual, it is actually comparable to the time of the shutdown. In terms of business, because all industries have not yet started, the supply seems to be available from Sui. Now it is slightly possible to expand, so it has been decided to start doing the noon market again from tomorrow (that is, March 10), and from then on, the southern market will restore its former original state, Yun</p>
<h3>Securities The Bond Price Drop Was Quite Strong Last Week</h3>
<p>▲ Fell by about two yuan compared to the previous week</p>
<p>▲ The total turnover reached 77 million yuan</p>
<p>Last week, the futures market of various public bonds in this port was very lively, and the popularity of buyers and sellers was very prosperous. There was a huge amount of entry and exit every day. The most transactions were on Monday, and the total turnover for the whole week was 77.01 million yuan, which was more than double the previous week. The spot market was very clear, and only 103,500 yuan was issued for the whole week. The changes in the prices of each bond were more falling than rising compared to the previous week, and the decline was not equal to one or two yuan. However, the fluctuations of the financial 96 were still slight. The statistics of the high and low prices of each bond during the last week are listed below (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Last Week, the Yarn Market Was Very Volatile</h3>
<p>The cotton second-hand market has had a wide range of fluctuations and rapid changes in the past week, affected by the gold rush, and there are many rumors in the commercial market, saying that this second-hand has been transferred to Japan, and the price is 112 yuan per day, excluding water wages, and the number is about several thousand pieces. For a while, the atmosphere was broadcast, and the popularity of the market was extremely tense. In one day, the standard yarn rose by four or five taels. Later, the investigation was inaccurate because the decoration of this yarn was not suitable, and the Japanese had a deep sense of patriotism. All items were not allowed to be sold without official registration. Therefore, the saying that this yarn was shipped to Japan could not be realized. At the same time, the whole city was loosened, the copper price continued to rise, and people's hearts were greatly hit. The market plummeted and the situation was fierce. However, the attitude of a certain giant manufacturer remained firm, and the pulling force was high. There was no intention of relaxing. It was found that its contracted amount was getting thicker and thicker. At the end of the week, the situation of overseas cotton yarn was trending downstream, and the exchange rate was lengthened, and Japanese cotton merchants made a large number of profits, which affected the yarn market even more, and the actual sales were completely stagnant, so the market turned sharply downward, but most buyers were still in a bullish position, and bought more on dips. However, judging from the general trend, it is advancing on a soft road, because the demand is not smooth, the price of gold is loose, and the market situation is sluggish. It is found that the total number of existing yarns bought by various gangs in a week is only 2,995 bales, and the total number of existing yarns bought by peers is 2,335 bales. During this week, the price of each month is nearly 3 taels lower than that of the previous week, and the far is 2 taels 89 qian lower. The total turnover for the whole week is 131,250 bales. If the actual sales do not improve and the price of gold does not move, the market prospects are still changing. It is also unknown whether the standard yarn will break the 70 tael mark. Now, the amount of each gang's purchase is recorded on the left,</p>
<p>Gang Mouth Package Amount Gang Mouth Package Amount Ningbo One ○ Five Inland One, One hundred and fifteen Nanyang Two hundred and ten Qinhuangdao One hundred</p>
<p>Yunnan Four hundred and fifty Tianjin Two hundred and seventy-five Niuzhuang One hundred</p>
<p>Jiangxi Eighty Shantou One hundred and thirty Miscellaneous Gang One hundred</p>
<p>Guangdong Eighty Sichuan Two hundred and fifty Colleagues Two, three hundred and thirty-five</p>
<h3>The Confusion of Cotton Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market has still had a large range of ups and downs this week, and it is difficult to grasp. Most of the psychological views on the market are high, because the inventory is weak, and the gold market is fluctuating, making people confused. However, the bulls have a slight opportunity, and the pulling force is getting stronger and stronger. The new sellers are all like frightened birds. However, the spot cotton transaction is flat, and each factory has no intention of hoarding high-priced raw materials due to the poor sales of yarn, so as to avoid danger. However, the raw materials in the world are still in the era of excess. However, due to the exchange rate relationship with China, the rise in the price of gold is not conducive to the calculation of the silver market. The domestic raw materials are not enough to supply, and foreign cotton needs to be adjusted. Because the price of gold is difficult to be small, speculators are competing to buy. The market price is completely controlled by the gold market. At the end of the week, the number of Japanese Dongmian bulls was the largest this time, and they were eager to look high. They had to look at the 60 taels of Dongyang Gang. Considering that the overseas cotton market was not good and the price of silver was rising, they sold out a large number of them, so the market fell step by step. However, people in the cotton industry are deeply worried about the lack of domestic raw materials, and they are deeply worried about the lack of domestic raw materials. If the exchange rate is loosened, there will be a huge change in the cotton market. The results of the highest 45 taels and three qian and the lowest 42 taels and five qian were recorded in the stock exchange flower last week, and the price of each month fell by one tael and forty-five qian compared with the previous week. The source on the wharf was 5,950 bales of Yao flowers, and the existing cotton bought by each factory was not much, totaling 2,050 pieces and 400 bales, totaling 8,260 dan, and the second line totaled 4,280 dan. The price of American cotton fell by 10 pounds, and the price of Indian cotton fell by 45 Robi. Now, the number of bales bought by each manufacturer and firm is recorded below,</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Is Extremely Tired and Has No Spirit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially tired due to bad news from Liverpool, and sellers were enthusiastic, but later it slightly recovered due to the purchase of the same industry, and the futures fell by four to seven pounds, and the spot fell by five pounds. British cotton futures fell by sixteen or seven points, and the spot fell by fifteen points. The spot price of Egyptian cotton fell by twenty points. Indian cotton was initially tired due to the small drop in American cotton and the selling of local empty accounts, but later it became softer due to Liverpool's bad news and the sale of brokers. It is estimated that the near and far term of Pingguoer fell by two Robi, Aomura fell by four Robi, the far term fell by three Robi, and the near and far term of Bairoxi fell by four Robi. The original telegram is recorded on the left (7th electricity).</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Markets Are Trending in a Spin</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei Yesterday was Sunday, and the inland sources continued one after another. The sales in this street were uneven. The Beigeng sales market was mainly high, and the ideas of cargo customers were different. In the morning, the high cargo was very stable, and the ordinary station was stable, but it was especially firm due to its scarcity. However, at the close of the market, the weather was clear, and there was a sign of turning dull and soft. In total, there were corners left and right, and the entry and exit were thin. The low-priced paddy field arrived and was equally eliminated. The high ones were straight, the middle ones were flat, and the second ones were slightly lowered. The hearts of Yangdu and various tips were quite good. Although the appetite was not refreshing, the chemical market was very beautiful. The transformation of the Yuan Yin was consistently standing, and there were not many transactions. The overall market situation was spinning.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived in Hexia, and the sales were mediocre. The selection of good rice from Changsu and other geng was entirely determined by the seller's nature, because there were nearly corners of spinning. However, after Tiangong Zheng, the hearts here were quite indifferent. Nanbang Baozao's arrival was rare, and customers in the street were not happy with the street's intentions. There was not much change in the general trend. Yangxian was still rare and the price was stable. Baiyuan was dull and unchanged, and the market was high and firm, but tired.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Smoke Leather, and Iron are Selling Actively</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the hardware market was extremely flat. Among the gold market goods, except for the three-six-foot five-sheet to thirteen-sheet smoke leather iron, which was selling actively, everything else was quiet. However, the number of new goods imported was quite large. Triangle iron, flat iron, white iron tile, tinplate, etc. were all shipped in large quantities. Old iron types such as foreign yuan heads and square board heads also had tens of thousands shipped to Shanghai. The market situation is due to the rise in foreign exchange, so there is a trend of being strong outside and weak inside. Buyers are even more afraid to start. Afterwards, the market is quite dull.</p>

<h3>Commercial News</h3>
<p>▲ Huang Weiqiao of the Fohua Advertising Company declared that Chen Junbingqian, a giant merchant from Guangdong, is famous at sea, with high moral character and prestige. He is naturally kind and has been helping public welfare a lot. He is especially devoted to friendship. He is a person of modern times with ancient virtues. Yesterday, Chen held a family gathering banquet at a private residence. I was invited and was lucky enough to be at the end of the seat. According to Chen, the purpose of this kind of banquet is to connect the feelings of brothers, children, grandchildren, and relatives and friends of the same clan, so that they can have a chance to meet and talk and exchange information so as not to be isolated. Because Chen's clan is prosperous and scattered in Shanghai, they often run around for food and clothing at ordinary times and are often separated. Therefore, they hold a family gathering banquet to make up for this deficiency. The initiation of this banquet started with Chen Jun's late brother, Fuchen, who determined that it must be held four times a year. On the day of the gathering, regardless of age or wealth, they gather together to have fun without any strangeness or blockage, and have the effect of uniting the group and working together. It is really the only good way to harmonize the family. I think its meaning is far-reaching, so I express it and hope that those with knowledge at sea will follow and promote it, Yunyun.</p>
<p>▲ Liyang Silk and Satin Bureau, Hongwu, Xiaodongmenkou, declared that since the bureau held a spring sale, the market has been unusually crowded for days. The reason is that the bureau selects materials exquisitely and sets prices extremely cheaply, and the cloak assembly is the cheapest one sells for only 7 yuan and 5 jiao, which is especially welcomed by the general public, Yun.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>▲The Baixing Grand Theater at the intersection of Laobazi Road and Fusheng Road announces that this theater will screen the hilarious, thrilling, and romantic blockbuster "Falling Flowers and Flowing Water" starring the deadpan slapstick king Buster Keaton starting from the 9th. According to Mr. Pei's previous performances of "The Athletic Doctor," "Falling Flowers and Flowing Water," and the recent "The Young Master Soldier," this film is Mr. Pei's only masterpiece.
