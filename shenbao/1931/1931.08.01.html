<h3>職業敎育（一）</h3>
<p>全國職業敎育討論會本屆大會今日在鎭江開幕集全國十九省區二百三十餘敎育界英後之士於一堂討論如何使敎育與社會打成一片即如何使敎育能職業化實際化發抒其充實個人生活發展國民生計扶植社會生存之偉力之重大問題實爲今日我國敎育事業上一極値得吾人注意之事件</p>
<p>今日我國家以人民科學知識之不足生産落後致社會現象所呈現於吾人眼前者一方面爲工業凋敝田地荒蕪飯不夠吃衣不夠穿故國家乃以貧弱民生乃以疲困而亂乃滋生另一方面則全國中等敎育機關多未能顧及社會之現實情形及其現實需要未能顧及預備大多數靑年適當的生活及其獲得生活之技能所設課程皆爲升學及高深研究之準備雖稍有關於工業農業之科目俱多空泛淺薄抑且僅憑書本作死的敎授而無活的實習只重用腦不重用手以故大多數學生畢業出校旣困於家境無力升學而學無專能謀事又無門甚且自視極高工農之事不屑卑就於是腦無所用手無所能坐以消費不能生産乃成爲社會上高等之遊以</p>
<p>綜上述兩種現象而觀一方面則爲生産落後民苦貧困一方面爲民無所能不能生産實則後者爲前者之因前者乃爲後者之果欲謀補救則提倡職業敎育改革中等敎育　以謀解决社會之貧困一以謀解决個人之生計殆爲其大端</p>
<p>中山先生曾有言「學校之目的於讀書識字學問智識之外當注重於雙手萬能力求實用」所謂雙手萬能力求實用者即生産之所所在也即生計之所在也亦即職業敎育之所在也中央頒布之敎育實施方針亦明白規定一普通敎育須養成國民之生活技能增進國民之生産能力」所謂養成生活技能即解决個人之生計也增進生産能力即解决國家之貧困也而致此之道亦即實行職業敎育故提倡職業敎育訓練人民生活技能實爲我國家今日起衰救敝之要術絶不容緩敎育部前次限制設立普通中學添辦職業學校之通令中曾痛陳今日中學敎育之不切實用並能云「苟循此不變將見民生枯竭社會兀臬靡有底止」其言至痛而又至切</p>
<p>中央旣有實施方針之規定敎育部復有限期實行之通令但如何期能實行如何期能收效吾人謹以熱忱深盼此次之職業敎育討論會諸君子能有切實具體之貢獻</p>

<h3>韓民移殖東北之研究</h3>
<p>（九續）彬</p>
<p>（二）日警權之無限伸張　韓民在我東北足跡所到之地。日警權即隨之伸張。日人常嗾使韓僑中之不良分子。作種種危害我國家之非法行爲。我方無法取締。如本年四月中旬。我東北邊防軍駐吉副司令公署防共辦事處翻譯官吳仁華被日籍韓人金正元槍殺。事後金正元避居日領事館。幾經交涉。毫無結果。懸案迄今。又如美記者色威爾氏調查哈爾濱日韓人民在日本警察庇護縱容之下。竟藉滿鐵區内之日郵局寄遞鴉片嗎啡海羅因及其他毒物。并另派專足送至沿中東路之各處售買。僅安達一地。日韓人所設之半公開之售買毒物處。竟達六十餘家。若我當局拘捕其人。日警則出而干涉日領則提出抗議。故無法禁止。馴至毒物遍地。凡此韓人種種之非法行爲。以及不正當營業。均在日本警察縱容。與日本法權庇護之下而發生。積案纍纍。懸不能决。</p>
<p>（三）韓僑國籍之糾纷　前所引田中奏章有云。「·····其歸化之朝鮮人。名雖爲支那之歸化民。不久仍然歸復爲我國民。······乃只因一時之便宜而歸化爲支那民耳。····加之鮮民中之在滿蒙有歸化爲支那民者。而亦有未歸化者。迨事到之日。是支那籍之朝鮮民作亂。抑或日本籍之朝鮮民作亂。可以懸羊頭賣狗肉之方策而付之。·····」此語眞不啻日人對於利用二重國籍韓民擾我之陰謀之自白。今日韓人一入我國境。即自成村落。一村之内歸化者與未歸化者。混雜而居。良善者尙能耕作以自活。桀黠者則肆意横行。無所不爲。彼居我土。食我食。但我如行使統治權。彼則嗾使未歸化者出而反抗。我若化外視之。彼則又自承華籍。公然租買土地。尤有甚者。多數韓民旣已歸化我國。同時復隷籍日本。以一人而有兩重國籍。此輩韓民時爲華人。時爲日人。變幻無定。一以日人之指使爲轉移。當東北韓僑與華人發生地畝糾葛及民刑訴訟事件時。韓人常本着二重國籍資格。托庇日人。受日人之挑撥。以破壤我國司法。反之。若韓人在韓犯法。常以東省爲　逃藪日本軍士因逮捕韓人。往往與國人發生衝突。致使國人常遭受各種意外之損害。韓人挾二重國籍以求便利。日人乃從中利用。製造口實。以謀侵襲。陰險毒辣。而其爲害於東北。亦以此尤爲特甚。</p>
<p>（四）韓民之擾亂我地方治安　韓民移我東北者。家計多屬貧苦。其能刻苦務農者固多。而甘爲匪徒。托庇於日本警察權掩護之下。以謀破壤我東北地方治安者。亦實繁有徒。蓋其槍械有日本之來源。竊藏又有日人之袒護。我地方當局緝治爲難。</p>
<p>無如彼何。韓蒙其名。我蒙其害。而日則鼓掌於旁。深慶其計之得逞。</p>
<p>綜此數者。韓民移殖對我東北之迫害。已可槪見。來日方長。後患無已。是則我國家其可不速籌補救之對策乎。（未完）要聞</p>

<h3>接收法公廨之中法人員　本館攝</h3>
<p>多、一時不易接管、於是乃由梁院長等議定、先將法廨一切物件、完全移交於新院、而待今晨再行檢點、至昨晩、則派潘壽賢書記官·楊蘭春·翻譯員二人、負擔保管責任、</p>

<p>▲今日履新　今晨九時、梁應院長等、將赴新院接事、因昨晩趕辦移交手續後、時間忽促、各項瑣屑之事、均未理淸、故今日兩院長當將督率人員、料理移交後未淸之事、法院内案件、大部停止審理、惟有重要緊急案件、仍照常開庭、</p>
<p>▲新址氣象　兩院辦事處、高院在西愛咸斯路恒愛里、特院在薛華立路和玫坊、（即法公廨之後）昨晩已着人將一切木器用具、遷入各新址外、懸以簇新之白底黑字標牌、房屋亦大事振刷、煥然一新、頓增蓬勃氣象、從此本埠三界之司法機關、均隷屬於中央司法統治之下、而法租界會審公堂之名、將成爲歷史上之過去名詞矣、</p>

<p>（二）分論、工作時間及其相關的條文、一、幼年工、在工廠作工的兒童、年齡在十二歲與十六歲之間者、我們稱爲幼年工、比幼年工再小的我們稱爲童工、不過我國現時尙缺人口調查、尙未採用出生證、所以對於年齡的證明是很難的、因此我們此次的調查、不問兒童的年齡、以實情論、有許多工廠裏的小孩們、照他們的身高與體格論、大約在十歲左右、童工的工作狀况、有许多地方、其困苦情形、與童工委員會（民國十三年）的報告相似、不過這一個報告、在輿論方面、已經發生相當的效力、因爲有許多新式工廠、已逐漸廢除最幼的小孩、併且外籍的棉紗廠、（共三十四家）現在對於幼年工的雇用、先量小孩的高度、合格然後人廠作工、此種量法、在幾個華藉的紗廠及絲織廠、亦已採用、唯所採用的高度不同、但英尺四尺二寸、是比較普通的標準、這個標準、是根據測量一千個小孩的均數、上海有幾個新式繅絲廠、逐漸採用日本式煮繭機、將繭子在另一室内煮熟、然後送給繅絲女工、因此煮煎的工作、不須童工負責、這有兩種利益、童工當然可以減少、併且繅絲室的温度、因不須煮繭、可以減低、因此繭廠的工作情形可以改良、我國工廠法規定幼年工須滿十四歲、才能入廠作工、其證明方法、依工廠法施行條例、係由法定代理人證明、實際此種證明法是靠不住的、一般代理人、爲救濟小孩家庭經濟困難起見、對於較小的小孩、亦必定説是合法定年齡的、年齡的證明、通常有幾種方法、一、由小孩或法定代理人證明之、二、由雇主或工廠職員斷定之、三、由裁判官或醫生斷定之、印度與香港對於幼年工的辦法、多由政府雇用的醫生證明、醫生在小孩未入廠前、檢騐身體、强健者由醫生發給許可證、憑證入廠作工、不發證者不能作工、醫生同時斷定小孩的年齡、但不注重年齡的證明、而注重小孩的健康、上海六種工業裡、現有童工一一八九五人、（據上海市社會局最近報告、十業内共有童工二七四八二人、）其雇用童工、最多者爲繅絲棉紡印刷機器與烟草案、除外籍棉紗廠、目下已經不用最幼的童工外、（他們的幼年工、其身高必及四尺二寸）、有許多華籍工廠裡、尙有年齡很小的童工、但各方面的意見、多以爲童工應該取締、著者對於取締的方法、願貢獻意見如下、政府應委任醫生若干人、查騐小孩的身體、合格者給與雇用證、合格的兒童、必須身高若干尺、（由調查後斷定）至少必須十二歲、（年齡的證明不是主要的）上列此種辦法、有兩種困難、甲、對於已經雇用的兒童、須另發一種證書、以示區别、乙、政府須另出委任醫生的費用、但以英國的經騐論、費用並不大、當一九零一年時醫生如往工廠查騐身體、每五個小孩收費二先令六辦士自六個小孩以上、每個收費六辦士、兒童如果到醫生診所受騐、每個收費六辦士、「收費章程、自第二次修改後、每工廠有十個兒童以上者、收費二先令六辦士、有一百個以上者、收費七先令六辦士」、香港的工業兒童條例、在一九二二年通過、一九二九年修改、當通過那一年兒童十歲以上可以入廠作工、修改的時候、將兒童年齡升爲十二歲、據華民政務司的報告、此種修改、未經任何人的反對、足見立法由寛而嚴、工人易得實益、以本調查爲根據、即知男女童工的工作時間、大致是無區别的、不過印刷業是有特殊情形、因爲這一業的工人、在夜間大致不是做全班的、乃於忙時由日工延長幾小時工作而已、六工業平均的夜工工作時間、爲男工九·二小時、女工八·七小時、童工七·七小時、不過如以每班的鐘點數目爲標準、六業的平均工作時間、爲九·六小時、棉紡業的工作時間、無論日班與夜班、多在十一小時以上、至於每晝夜的班數、除繅絲及機器業、只有一班外、其餘工業多在一班以上、化學工業、每晝夜有一·三班、食品有一·二班、（内中烟草業有一零二班、或僅有少許夜工、棉紡業每晝夜兩班、每班差不多十二小時、公用事業三班、每班八小時、以上的事實告訴我們、上海的工業大槪可以實行十小時工作制、不過此制實行、紡績工業、（特别棉業與絲業）要受經濟上的損失、全部的經濟上損失是多少、著者不能估計、因爲中外工廠、對於出品價値、固定費用等項、未曾供給適當的資料、不過工業因縮短工作時間、所受的經濟損失、至少包括下列三項、甲、出品的減少、乙閉廠時間的固定費用、丙、工資、工作時間縮短之後、工人的疲倦可以減少、工作效率可以提高、所以生産不一定是減低、不過這種效果、要經過相當期間、才可實現、並且不是普通的現象、因爲有許多工廠、其出品以機器爲標準者、縮短時間、即是減少生産、至於工人呢、無論計時與計件、大致多不肯因爲縮短工作時間、減少工資、其結果工廠方面至少須付與前一樣的工資、少數的工廠、對於縮短工作時間的經濟損失、略有估計、有幾個棉紗廠、以爲自十二小時減至十小時、其總數經濟損失、爲百分之九、内中僅生産量一項、要減少百分之十七、有一個大規模的製造廠、於兩年前縮短工作時間、（由十時至九時）其總損失爲百分之十、據這個廠家的估計、如果再减至八小時、其增加的損失爲百分之十二·五、公用事業　、有一家雇用工人九五零人、於兩年前、實行八小時工作制、其總損失爲每年八四零零元、工作時間、應與夜工相提並論、我國工廠法第十二條、童工不得在午後七時至翌晨六時之時間内工作、第十三條、女工不得在午後十時至翌晨六時之時間内工作、香港童工、在十五歲以下者、晩七時以後晨七時以前、不准作工、幼年工十八歲以下者、晩九時以後晨七時以前、不准作工、印度幼年工與女工、晩七時以後晨五時半以前、不准作工、自一九二九年禁止深夜工以來、日本棉紗業、每晝夜工作十七小時、分爲兩班、（每班八小時半）其用一班制者、夜工可延長至晚間十一時、我國工廠法如照現在規定、每晝夜只有十六小時工作、分爲兩班、除經濟的損失不計外、尙有實際困難、譬如工人寄宿舍間題、日本的棉紗廠、女工大致有寄宿舍、所以夜間放工以後、歸家不發生問題、但上海的女工、大致多在鄰近的鄉村住家、夜間如果十時放工、女工歸家、便成個困難問題、至於寄宿舍一層、缺點甚多、似乎我國不可倣行、根據以上事實及理由、我國現時不能通行每晝夜十六小時的工作制、特别是因爲國際間競爭劇烈、我國工人的效率太低、著者的建議、是十小時工作制、對於女工與幼年工、無論日間與夜間、其工作時間、均爲十小時、在工廠法實行三年之内、深夜工暫時保存十小時工作制的例外、如下（甲）有些工業、其製造工作運用機器、有繼續性不能停止者、（任何者屬於例外、須列舉之、）（乙）有季節性的工業、（用列舉法、但絲業不能作爲例外）、（丙）工業專用男工者、（丁）遇天災及特别事變者、在三年之内、工業應切實研究、禁止深夜工問題、並須特别注意下列二事、（甲）男工可以替代女工麽、棉紗業雇主、大槪以爲這是不可能的、湖南與湖北有幾個棉紗廠、是用男工的、不過也只限於較粗的工作、印度的棉紗廠工人、百分之四是幼年工、女工佔較小的部份、這種情形、與他國棉紗業不同、亦非我國於短時間内、可以倣效的、天津某工廠、近已實行八小時制、不過據説這個工廠於經理方面、向有困難、爲救濟失業工人起見、將二班改成三班、雖自八小時工作實行之後、生産約增百分之四、但同業極力反對、新制是否可以成功、很是問題、惟勞資感情、似已逐漸改善、併夜工减至每月十次、（但關於夜間十時、如何換班、使女工歸家、不發生困難一點、現時尙無確實報告、）在三年之内、工業應該研究深夜工禁止之後、如何可以免除女工的失業或銷路的减少、這就是增加機器的問題、我們可以日本的經騐作參考、日本用三年工夫、作廢除深夜工的準備、我們以爲時期太長、購買大批機器、以免生産降低、减少銷路、我們以爲未免過慮、其事實與理由、見John　E.Orchand的「日本的經濟地位」John　E.Orchand,s"Johan,s　Economic　Position"末了、還有額外工作、其工資比平常工資增加三分之一、至三分之二、這幾點似乎與現狀相符、可以通行、關於這個問題、著者的建議如下、幼年工在任何情形之下、不許有額外工作、日班與夜班女工、亦不許有額外工作、以便保護女工與幼年工的建康、（二）休息日放假日與特别休息日、休息日放假日、與特别休息日、應該分别討論、與綜合討論、因爲各種工業的休息與休假情形、不同、所以爲求明暸起見、應該分别討論、因爲休息與休假、一面保護工人健康、一面减少生産、亦是工業經濟損失的一部份、應該綜合討論、我國工廠法規定、每七日休息一日、每年國定例假七日、特别休假日每年自七日至十五日、（以工人服務年限斷定之）這些放假日、多須給資的、此外尙有放假對於生産的降底、固定費用等關係、但因關於這兩層、本調查不能搜集資料、所以不能估計經濟損失的全部、至於局部損失、特别是工資的付給、可以简論如下、（甲）休息日、上海的工業、在每日工作時間裏、大致有休息時間的、短者十五分鐘、長者一小時、普通多在吃飯的時候、至於整日的休息日、其情形很參差不齊、少數廠家、每月内没有休息日、有些廠家採用計工制、表面雖有休息日的規定、但如工人在休息日作工、可得雙工、工人受此鼓勵、（特别是件工）請願作工、藉可多得工資、所以休息日雖有應無、有些工業、是含繼續性的、其工人不能有休息日、但每日的工作時間、比普通工業短些、除上述情形之外、其餘的工廠、對於休息日是給假的、其數目每月自兩日至四日不等、以本調查而論、一七六工廠的休息日爲每月二·六日、所以按照實際情形休息日還是不多的、雖然、爲工人的健康起見、休息日必不可缺、但生産及工作效率的關係、休息的日數、只可徐徐增加、不能操之過急、一七六工廠每月平均有休息日二·六日、内中給資者五五家、不給資者一二一家、内中給資者大槪是雇用長工的廠家、往往採用升工制、例如每月滿二十八工者、得三十工的工資、滿三十工的、得三十三工的工資、有些外國廠家、每月滿二十六工者、得二十九工的工資、（星期日休息不給資）休息日（與放假日）應與我國他巿的實情互相比較、然後可得一種概念、據工商部五十一市的調查、有十七市的工業工人、每市在一萬以上、就中有六市、（靑島·南通·上海·武昌·廣州·順德、）其每年的休息日與放假日、在三三日以上、有兩市（漢口·宜興）、則在二四與三○日之間當日本禁止深夜工時、每月有休息日四時、自禁止深夜工以來、每月只有休息日二日、英國每星期有休息日一日半、印度每月有四日、不過多是不給資的、我國工廠法、關於休息日給資的條文、顯然是與工人們表同情的、工人爲改進經濟生活起見、近來往往要求增加他們的入欵、因此要求休息日給資、不過休息日給資、似乎與原則不符、工人們不如變換方針、向要求增加工資一方</p>
<p>會、在重要工商業區、調查生活費、然後制定生活指數、以爲規定最低工資的標凖、按我國工廠法規定、每月人休息日四日（卽每年五二日）及國定例假八日、多須給資、卽以給資一端而論、工業的經濟負擔、已屬可觀、有一個工廠、雇用工人九八三人、曾作一種做計、以爲每七日休息一日、須付工資二五六五元、并因爲繼續性的工作、逢第七日尚須多雇七分之一的工人、這又是另一種的費用、棉紗廠逢星期日、大概是休息而不給資的、有一種繅絲廠、以爲每逢星期日休息、其生産量每日要减少三擔、因定費用、每日要增加二七五兩、（折合銀三七·六七一元）據本調查、各工業每年所給休假日與放假、平均爲三二·一日、或與每月休息日兩日、及例假八日相等、因此我們已爲每月休息日兩日、再加每年國定例假八日、似與實情相近、但因實行十小時工作、於工業已有重大經濟影響、所以我們以爲國定例假日給資、休息不給資、有些工廠、（華籍與外籍俱有）已逐漸遵守國民政府命令、逢紀念日放假、不過情形亦不一致、放假日數亦不一律　每年自一日至八日不等、但其趨勢是顯明的、是遵照國府命令、一方面進行的、此種例假日、於提倡愛國精神、有相當關係、似應普遍的推行、有些工廠、鑒於我國習慣的難改、逢節假廢曆年節、仍舊放假、此層亦是循俗、政府似不必苛求、新曆年假是普遍的、綜合言之現在工廠、每年平均給假一四·四日、「卽國定例假四·七日、節假一·七日、新暦年年假三·九日、廢歷年假四·一日、」關於國定例假給資的工廠八一家、不給資的七二家、關於節假給資的工廠四八家、不給資的六八家、關於陽曆年假給資的工廠六六家、不給資的一零七家、關於廢歷年假給資的工廠三一家、不給資的九一家、實情旣如上述、我們對於休息日及放假日的建議如下、每年逢國定例假日放假八日給資、理由如下、這個問題、須兼顧工人健康及工業生産、如果專爲健康設相、休息日當然越多越好、但以全國論、現時的休息日與放假日、還是很少、已如上述、所以只可暫定每月二日、再加每年國定倒假八日、就中以休息日一層、於五年之後、可以增加、至每月四日、至於生産問題、須討論國際競爭、南滿洲有大規模的日籍工廠一九零家、其每月休息日、平均只有二·二日、大阪市的工業化程度已甚高、但以大規模工廠一七零家而論、其每月休息日平均僅有二·九日、我國工業化程度幼稚、工人效率比較甚低、若再加以休息日、與休假日、生産必更　低、如何與外國工業競爭、實際放假日給資、在外國是無成例、於原則似見健全的理由、不過我們以爲逢國定例假日放假並給資、寓有提倡愛國精神的美意、可以實行、我們對於工人們的要求增加入欵一層、應請求政府對於工資與生活費、從速加以科學的研究、以便實行適當的解决方法、按工廠法每年放假六十日給資、其費用甚大、但有些工廠、現在對於放假日、（紀念日或節假）有給資的、有一個工廠雇用五五令人、以爲例假八日的工資、須五九零零元、不過如果拿現在的給資放假日來替代一部份其增加的費用、只有一五零零元、棉紗廠對於放假日、大致是不給資的、所以例假八日的工資要增加總費用的百分之三了、總之、現的休息日、每月平均二·六日放假日、每年平均一四·四日、我們以爲工廠法可以規定、休息日每月兩日、不給資、國定例假日每年八日給資、等於工廠法内放假日六十日的費用七分之一强、）因爲工資問題、是根本的、俟政府對於該問題有相當研究之後、再連帶的研究休息日與放假日問題、特别休息日、印度與我國、常有多數工人、遠離家鄉以謀生、兩國人民、對於家鄉的觀念頗重、所以印度的辦法、往往在可能範圍内、給予工人於一年之内、回鄉省親的機會、但不給資、我國工廠法、爲迎合我國人民的社會思想起見、亦有特種休假的規定、以工人服務年限爲標準、定每年休假日自七日至十五日一律給資、新開的工廠、對於此種條文、不發生影響、較歷史的工廠、如果他們對於工人、服務年限有紀錄的、覺得這是一種極大的經濟負擔、譬如有一個工廠、雇用五六七人、對於特種、休假日估計如下、工人一年以上三年以下者給假七日、計四零零元、工人三年以上五年以下者給假十日、計一七零零元、工人五年以上十年以下者給假十四日、計一一六零零元、工人十年以上者給假十五日、計四四零零元、有一個雇用二二五令人的工廠、估計特種休假日的費用、爲每年六零零零元、有一個工廠、其人數爲六零一人、關於特别休息日的費用如下、一六七人每年給假七日、計九七零元、七六人每年給假十日、計七五零元、二一四人每年給十四日、計二八五零元、一四四人每年給假十五日、計二四零零元、有一個大規模工廠、共有工人九三零零人、估計特種休假日的費用、爲每年一零七、零零零元、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>漁翁得利</p>
<p>英國烏克拉捕鯨公司Aukra　Com　Pany的船主殷白拉曾Cap　Lngrightsen最近捕得一尾鯨魚。他獲利之多。比了普通的鯨魚。在一百倍以上。眞所謂漁翁得利了。大普通的鯨魚。其脂肪中所産的油。可値四百金鎊。而殷白拉曾所得的一尾。竟可値四萬金鎊。那鯨魚並不很大。脂肪的産量自然也和普通的鯨魚不相上下。但是水手們在剖割的時候。忽然驚喜非常的同聲歡呼起來。原來發見了一大塊無形的黄色物。足足重一百多鎊。你道這黄色物是甚麽。原來是世界中極名貴的龍涎香。每兩的代價。須二十金鎊。比金價還貴上五倍。這種龍涎香。是製造香水的廠家極需要的東西。所製的香水。無論是那一種香味。要是一加了龍涎香在内。香可永久不减。以前在鯨魚中只發見過兩次。面積比這一塊還大。這是第三次了。據説鯨魚平時的食料。便是海中的烏賊。而龍涎香却是從烏賊的尖嘴中産生出來的。</p>
<h3>東北歸客談</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>客有自哈爾濱歸者。晤之於逆旅。言東北之瑣事頗多。今日萬寳山案方轟動於全國。拉雜記之。不僅供談助已也。客之言曰。滿洲處日俄兩大勢力之間。當軸處　殊匪易事。而日人之處心積慮。尤爲狠毒。誠以日本僅四三七○○方里。有八千五百萬人口。滿洲六五○○○方里。只二千八百萬人口。乃努力於推進移墾政策。移日人於朝鮮。朝鮮人復移之於滿洲。此次萬鮮慘案之發生。即日人推進移墾政策之明證也。按東省之華農。多自山東登萊一帶移來者。勤樸耐勞。素爲日韓人所嫉忌。縱多赤手起家之富户。惜無遠大之眼光。互助之精神。此爲普通華人之缺點。無容諱言者也。而日人則不然。有某富户者。專貸欵於韓農。深得韓農之好感。遂致供其利用而不知。此又慘案原因之一也。東省鬍匪徧地。凶悍異常。哈埠日落以後。　肆咸閉户。荆天棘地。跬步不敢出焉。而日本浪人。莫不與鬍匪稔。故鬍匪雖悍。日人能玩之於股掌之上。否則日人焉能猖獗如此。在日本則不但智識階級。深知愛國之道。即浪人亦然。遠非鬍匪所能及也。然鬍匪亦甚狡詐。去冬某村。鬍匪來襲。村人架砲堡中以相禦。匪不得逞。一日。有數人舁棺來。似欲葬於堡旁。村人出而阻之。不知竟墮其計。呼嘯一聲。數人於棺中競出槍械。破堡而入。逐遭洗刦。蓋即前不得逞之鬍匪也。鬍匪善騎射。居民亦然。有匪自一家飽載出。忽聞砰然一聲。三匪相繼倒地。餘匪不知彈從何來。譁然作鳥獸散。事後始知被刦之家。有女才九齡。見匪出。匿於窗後。遽以槍擊匪。殪之。聞者莫不佩小女子之智勇也。客又言東省富森林及金礦。洵爲天府之區。即如伊通河。松化江一帶。膏腴遍地。宜於水稻。餘則無不宜種麥者。此日人之所以耽耽逐逐也歟。</p>
<h3>熱中談冷記</h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>驕陽肆虐。溽署困人。有客方自杭垣來。喘息未定。汗出如瀋。急索冰淇濓解署。一杯甫罄。再索不已。余笑曰。客且少安。余請告以却署之方。客曰諾。乃爲啟電扇。治瓜果。命侍役於隔室大放自來水籠頭。瞿然而告之曰。天雨矣。客曰。然乎。吾固知天之將雨也。余曰。此時之炎署稍减否。客方翻閲案頭之書。徐徐答曰。天時莫測。此一雯時間。誠凉爽多矣。余乃鼓掌而起曰。有是哉。心理作用亦奇已。因復告以適間言雨。謊也。一炎一凉。無非隨心理之轉移耳。客亦啞然失笑。余曰。望梅可以止渴。聞冰豈不能却署。請各述冷之笑話。以資消署何如。客頷其首。余乃先效淳于之説曰。</p>
<p>客歲除夕。余方遊於杭。時適大寒。飄雪三尺。余偕女友華英。馳馬西郊。偶失　。馬不前行。以手搥之。馬躍起。余前仆於地。身印雪中。面目宛然。英大駭。急詢痛楚。余笑曰。無傷。特以今日此遊大樂。不可無記。故仿古人雪泥鴻爪之意。在雪中留影以爲紀念耳。</p>
<p>余言竟。客乃大笑。笑止。因亦作曼倩之説曰。前歲之冬。杭州大冷。西湖之水淺處。連底冰結。舟不能行。湖心亭中居民。數日不得登岸。行將絶食。於是有冒險者踏冰而行。不料行未及半。冰忽解。失足墮於水。幸兩旁有巨冰。堅且厚。其人淹没及肩。浮於水面。得不死。岸上人見之。莫能爲救。嗣經孔武有力者。投以竿。其人以手攀竿。釣之使上。事後謔者詢之曰。跑冰之戲樂乎。其人笑而答曰。無他。余殆效王祥之臥冰求鯉耳。</p>
<p>客言甫罷。室内笑聲大作。一人起曰。客言殊趣。余亦試述一則。以佐餘興何如。衆曰善。其人乃曰。某年大冷。寒署表降至零度以下。一冬烘先生。平時喜購日貨。而斥靑年愛國爲無謂多事。是日。適捧水烟筒就吸。不料筒水已冰。正擬喚僕易水。乃口沬沾筒。亦冰不可解。冬烘啟口不得。窘極而哭。涙纔流面。頓結爲冰。後由他人見之。爲之力拔得脱。但以用力過猛。脱一齒。血涔涔下。轉瞬。血亦化爲冰。一人嘲之曰。是眞冷血動物耳。</p>
<p>言未竟。滿室閧然。時則凉風忽至。溽署頓消。客乃披衣興辭。曰。今日一夕話。勝啖雪梨冰藕多多矣。余送客返。乃援筆爲之記。</p>

<h3>吾其魚矣</h3>
<p>— 天健</p>
<p>旬日來狂風暴雨。日必數作。大江南北。田禾盡爲水厄。决淮泛江。農人築堤而殉以身者。日有所聞。嗚呼。吾其魚矣乎。作吾其魚矣歌。歌曰。吾其魚矣天何酷。海翻地軸神鰲逸。巫支脱鎖天吳張。妖雲似驀吞赤日。二旬暴雨兼風雷。白晝晦暝如喑室。　溜如繩復如練。平地水泛溝澮失。淮泗奔流决長堤。長江運河浪湧溢。。農夫日夜不脱簑。男女老少心驚怵。夜半築堤捍馮夷。雨急水猛功難畢。搶地呼天天不靈。身被浪捲隨沕潏。東陌西阡更何分。萬千膏腴淪其七。京滬路淹車不通。津浦路沉又告窒。吾鄉低窪尤可憂。去处豐收才逢一。倉廪屯儲雖未虚。如此巨災豈足卹。今晨忽覩發陽光。入夜風狂雨更密。入夜風狂雨更密。吾儕不魚其可必。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（七一）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>余按英人勢力可戰勝德國之軍隊。而不能戰勝徒手之印人乎。此一大疑問。但甘地之所以奏一部分效力者。余觀之。凡有五原因。第一乃民族運動。英印之間。猶中國昔日之滿漢也。第二印人全境封鎖。本無從得軍械。舍徒手運動外更無他法。故迫極而發明此感情催眠術。萬事類由逼迫而生也。第三印人太多。而英人太少。無論如何。以如此大邦。英人不能殺得太多。第四印度哲學文化高。本容易趨於柔性運動。第五英自大戰以後。内力日衰。不若昔日之天驕矣。有此五種原因。甘地運動當可奏一部分之功。若如印人言專恃徒手運動。即可斷絶英人軍餉。讓出政府。予以獨立自由。如英人之於美國然。吾恐不易做到。未免太樂觀也。余固信心力學。然自古無如此奇功。以徒手而推翻政府者。吾意必有一日。仍從兵隊變化上解决實力問題。甘地運動其花耳。若欲振果。多少必藉腕力。印人今日希望。吾人尙難全信也。</p>
<p>一學生名士利大哈。年少善談。云其古代文明甚高。據吠陀經典。印度在西歷前四千年。即有飛艇及器械。止中間文化墮落。今日新學復興。古學亦復興。將來定可稱雄於世界。吾印人文化在世界不在一國也。余未能信。在西歷四千年前。印人能造飛艇。但若以西史及中國書比比。當亦不爲無理。據有名之偉而士世界史綱所載。希臘人以前有苛理通Crehtns族者。爲甚文明之民族。希臘人曾承受其文化。苛理通人曾造飛艇云。當非無據之言。與中國公輸般及墨子均造木鳶。此皆可信者。因魯般與墨子乃人人所共知之人。非玄談也。余游中國各省及南洋各地。均有魯般廟。蓋工藝關係。進化甚大。而今日工人時代。余甚盼中國各地敎員。提倡小學生研究魯般經也。魯般經有數本。各書坊有售者。爲木匠人所用。有圖有尺寸。言造木器房屋之法。各工匠引爲聖經。余曾一觀之。借未注意。今感覺其重要。乃古代工藝之精華。吾恐中國工人智識太低。有顚倒其書之處。然吉光片羽。至可寳貴。藉班門弄斧一語。可傳播其文化也。印度古本有工巧明之智識。其飛艇發明之年代過於希臘及中國。理或有之。然印度多神話。難盡信。或是理想。然有數學生正色告余載於古典。想非誣也。惜乎良史氏偉而士不及聞此言也。學生又言其古典吠陀經。今不完全。甚難讀。即印人學者亦易解也。此學生甚博雅。據他人云。其父爲一政治運動之有名首領家。學甚富云。</p>

<p>什麽話伊都嘮嘮叨叨地在伊兒子面前説，可是他實在没有一句話納入耳管裏去。他的妻子默默地立在一旁，也覺得有許多必要的話要説；祇恨着現在没有這個機會。</p>
<p>他終于把自己的來意説明了，他家裏的人才知道他的回來是專誠爲了拿錢出去。</p>
<p>靜坐了許久的他的父親，頓時露出了最嚴重的神情。「怎麽辦呢？到開學的時候想法還來得及，怎麽現在時候就要預先繳付？」他的父親憂急地説。</p>
<p>「一共要多少錢呢？」他的母親也無可奈何地問着。</p>
<p>「錢是不多，一百六十元就夠了。」他俯垂着的頭微微地抬了起來，斜着眼睛望望他的妻子。</p>
<p>他的妻子也覺得愛莫能助，祇是很替他可憐。一間屋子裹，頓時充溢着幽黯的情緖，漸漸引出了斷續的嘆息。</p>
<p>「本來我們這種人家那裹能夠供給兒子去讀書呢？爲了一個人讀書，差不多便要餓死三個人；説來話去，無非爲了這碗拉馬車的飯吃得苦夠了，所以痴心妄想節衣縮食地讓小榮去讀書，偏是這種洋學堂，才放了假，又要預先收什麽費，便是傾家蕩産，也拿不出去啊！」他的父親説得幾乎墮下眼涙來。他暗暗地只是自己呌苦。</p>
<p>他的母親却聽不過去了，伊似乎勸慰地説··「這也没有辦法啊！走上了這條路，總得拚一拚了。預先收什麽費，這也難怪它們，你想，縣衙門裏不是也預先收着三年的錢糧了麽？現在，也只有好好地商量個法子，讓小榮拿去。本來這是下的本錢，將來總有得整批的收回來呢。」</p>
<p>畢竟他的妻子想起了一個救急的法子，伊勇敢地説··「公公婆婆，也不必着急了！我想，只要小榮用功讀書，將來總有出頭的日子。現在拿一百六十塊錢出去，讓我們大家拼拼湊湊吧！我嫁來的時候，不是還有一副金手鐲吧！連着我賣花積下的零錢，算起來也得有一百塊多，祇要婆婆能夠把頭上的金器一起禊在裏邊時，一百六十塊錢就有着落了。」</p>

<p>▲大條果升初開反漲　早九月開盤即加一兩半、爲七百四十兩、大條長八分之一、銀價公私電各長四分之一、但不爲所動、俄頃同泰·萬興·元茂永·順利等皆有售出、即行下游二三兩、爲卅七兩二錢、忽聞銀行吃一八七五英金、復抬至卅九兩四錢、至先令開出時爲卅九兩、掛牌勿動、惟東洋小去二五、但此時宏利·晋安等買進、遂漲爲四十一兩二錢、後因匯豐售出英金一八七五、且元成永·乾昌祥·福餘等均售、乃價一落三兩數錢、至十點半爲卅七兩半、復由元興永·志豐永等拖進、又提高二兩、十一點後爲卅九兩四錢、繼因印匯遠期報大一安那、近期不動、又以零户售出、故降一兩零、十一點半後爲卅八兩二三錢頃刻萃昌永·萬興·順利等來進、又哄上一兩餘、午刻爲卅九兩九錢、片刻間抑落六七錢、至午收爲卅九兩半、續做至四十兩左右、揭價改爲七百九十兩零二錢、計撳五十兩之數、</p>
<p>▲買户一多逐漸盤上　後巿開盤四十兩、繼爲卅九兩三錢、蓋散户　出、又因英金仍結一八七五、至二點半始見上升、檀面上買者漸漸發展、復以同業恒有扒結英金、茲由麥行·三井·東亞等出九月一二五、旣而銀行要價零六二五、殆永豐·志豐永·福餘等相約買進條子、並聞國外將有大批現銀抵申、人心一振、驟然轟上三兩數錢、三點壯分、爲四十三兩七錢、頃聞匯豐買出一二五英金、似同當頭一棒、立退二兩零、計四十一兩半、至後平和之氣、略加兩許、將屆四點鐘銀行對做一二五、且買户似勤、旋後英金近期祇結零六二五、遠期或可一二五、乃金價續加一兩、計爲四十三兩半、迨四點卅分收盤爲四十三兩四錢、比較卅日計加四兩九錢、此乃迭遜三天之反動也、按一日間最大價四十三兩七錢、最小價卅七兩二錢、相去六兩五錢、</p>

<h3>大條回縮零六二五</h3>
<p>三十一日倫敦電、今日倫敦收盤銀價近遠期均十三便士、比昨日俱跌零六二五、</p>
<h3>外匯初鬆後昂</h3>
<p>昨日英美印銀巿均長、惟滬巿不爲所動、殆匯豐掛牌僅日匯减二五、爲一兩六錢四分、德匯加半元、計一百二十七馬克、其餘槪無變化、而英美日三匯内盤似乎秀利、惟波折甚少初平後鬆、復見堅昂、午後結果益佳、比較前天、計英金不過縮去零六二五、美日兩匯則平、但金巿曾回漲五兩之譜、華商交易並無大宗、然頗不沉寂、計英金約共二十萬鎊、金業中前抛後扒、乃宏利·成豐永等均有結進、至各銀行恒有對做、又美金少數而已、又日金略有購結幾十萬元、殆巿况站定之勢、茲聞日内將有大批銀塊運滬云、　　▲英匯　内盤僅零六二五升縮、上午出價一先令三辨士一二五、買價一八七五、匯豐·三井·住友·上海進九月一八七五、中法出有利進、對做一八七五、旋後匯豐出一八七五、故金價破進四十兩、麥行與上海互做十月一八七五至十一點半上海盤根出一八七五、（宏利進）午收出價一二五至一八七五、買價一八七五至二五、下午東亞出十月一八七五、（宏利進）、上海同價亦出、二點三刻後麥行·三井·東亞出九月一二五三點後匯豐出一二五、東亞與麥行對做十一月一八七五、安達·美豐同價做八月、荷　運通對做八月一二五、收巿出價一二五、買價一八七五、惟八九月出價零六二五、進價一二五、</p>

<h3>銀錢業月底比期進出特繁</h3>
<p>咋値七月底、銀錢業各種收解手續特殊浩繁、爲時間及調查關係、轉不能如平時之詳細贅述、巿場中厘價早午巿同爲七錢二分四厘三毫七忽半、銀拆早巿六分、午巿四分、劃頭無加水、一律白劃、銀根氣象似又轉鬆矣、做出滙劃票欵、早巿三百三十萬、午巿一百七十萬○一千、鈔票早巿三萬、午巿無交易、場外鈔票早巿十四萬二千、午巿七萬五千、銀行買賣、早巿互巿一百五十萬、午巿八十五萬、各銀行錢莊洋户往來及各種公單銀洋收解等等、槪以時間關係、未能核計從略、據大勢推測、較平時須加一二倍之譜、並聞洋押欵又有一百餘萬交易、小錢莊交易八十餘萬、各路匯欵收解一百三十餘萬、收現一百餘萬、江南小洋、早巿爲六錢四分九厘二毫半、午巿爲六錢五分、做出交易、早巿五千角、午巿三千角、廣東小洋早巿爲六錢四分二釐半、午巿爲六錢四分二厘二毫半、做出交易、早巿十一萬角、午巿三萬角、銅元回縮一千文、爲三百八十千文、</p>
<h3>七月份之存息底碼</h3>
<p>查七月份銀根久鬆、銀拆每日祇開數分、其間以五日之一錢二分爲最昂、故全日綜計數額祇有二兩○三分、以三十一天平匀扯計、每天僅六分七厘之譜、如是則上月份存息議盤、預測仍在二兩九五扣已耳、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債漲風甚勁</h3>
<p>▲二○捲飛漲達二元有半</p>
<p>▲餘亦漲一元至一元半許</p>
<p>昨日本埠證巿場各債劵巿况、九月期雖已開做交易、然因有其他關係尙未商洽就緒、故始終未行開出故昨僅八月期一　巿面、惟因債價變動頗烈、巿場進出非常活潑、各方人氣甚熱閙、計上午兩盤成交達一千一百數十萬、後巿一盤亦有五十餘萬、至言各債之變動情形、晨初疲弱、比交割前多下跌、旋以時局傳有轉機、巿場人心樂觀、買進交易非常暢旺、債價亦因求過於供、上漲甚勁、如二○關捲、統税各庫劵、上午開收兩盤均達二元餘、下午一盤雖續上漲、然趨勢已大見緩和矣、結果較週二如二○捲上漲達二元四角半、其他亦多回漲七八角至一元五六角不等、僅九六祇好數角、計全日現貨交易僅二千元、期貨上下午計一千六百九十餘萬元、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗巿一片抛空聲</h3>
<p>紗巿趨跌、形勢甚疲、蓋因工廠法有一部份暫可展緩、而北方時局不靜、外棉步步向下、致人心不振、且多頭心理傾向抛出、而某空户毫無扒補之念、逢漲加碼、加之原棉跌風大熾、紗巿牽動、至於現紗銷路尙稱不惡、但日商大形活動、内地帮吸收約有一千餘包云、</p>
<p>▲人標跌一兩外　交易所人標前巿開盤、以美棉平疲、人心尤虚、場中賈氣大盛、各跌一兩四·五·六·七錢、午後平平、遠月微漲二·四錢、成交計二萬九千五百包、查買出大孚一千九百包、瑞大一千五百五十包、長豐一千○五十包、買進泰興一千四百五十包、和愼一千六百包、榮興八百五十包、益昶二千零五十包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉花跌勢益勁</h3>
<p>棉巿跌風驟熾、蓋以世界棉業悲觀、美綿新花據私人估計、生産有一千四百萬包之望、而本埠天時已　晴正、受此影響甚大、買方壓力愈重因此人心又現愠恐之狀、旦某商棉花尙有大量抛出之説、所以目前難以穏定、前途究屬如何、須依美印棉巿及滙兑升縮爲轉移耳、</p>
<p>漢標暴跌八錢　交易所漢標前巿開盤、形勢愈虚、跌風更烈、各月跌六七錢、午後各月漲跌五分至一錢、全日成交計十四萬一千五百擔、查買出大孚四千七百擔、吉豐三千六百擔、公泰二千擔、同餘二千七百擔、長豐三千六百擔、信誠四千二百擔、買進天隆三千六百擔、泰興二千三百擔、愼昌二千四百擔、益成二千八百擔、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>外紗花氣象庸碌</h3>

<p>糧食　河下米巿到稀銷活</p>
<p>▲南巿　昨日各帮來源、寥寥無幾、浦存亦薄、今日下氣、恐有變化、蓋前巿猛瀉、且洋米由客帮續取價提、以致人心稍有進意、但成交稍旺、見此景况、亦現堅固而喊起、是以厚粳行情復硬三四角、中宿者略挺、後形照長江一帶水災關係、對於來船不無影響、蘆洋尖高料貨稀、價形跟起二三角、宿次不貪、巿呈帶緊、糯米陰化到銷二淡、巿無升沉、洋米客帮動辦到货仍缺　　▲新閘　米巿不見振作、因河積尙有、但到頭極缺、因國暦大月底、行號雙方循例結束賬欵、故銷塲不見十分活絡、各貨開盤、上落有限、厚粳及薄稻喊起三角、早稻變元胃口寥寥、價無漲跌、蘆洋尖及埠尖本街去路續有、巿形步緊、河廠貨斛開二三千担、</p>
<h3>七月份粉麥交割紀略</h3>
<p>▲麵粉交割祇七千包　昨爲七月份麵粉交割之日、全日交割數量聞衹七千包、計阜豐之紅藍車四千包、信大之綠砲臺一千包、華豐之綠麥根二千包、因各廠或在外面軋去、或則事前爲客帮抽裝、故爲數甚寂、期貨成交仍見暢旺、全月份總額計二千一百三十一萬四千包、茲分列于后、　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（單位千包）</p>
<p>七月份　二六六七　　八月份　三三五九</p>
<p>九月份　四三三七　　十月份　四三三四</p>
<p>十一月份三九一二　十二月份　二六○五</p>
<p>▲小麥交割五十二車　七月份之小麥、昨已全數舒齊、總數共五十二車、聞潤德交十三車、裕泰交五車、鼎泰交十二車、餘則爲零星各户、收進者亦爲行家、計泰潤收三十車、新豐十餘車、餘爲零星散户、此後如各處水退、本埠不患無貨、且洋麥近日來又成交甚暢、如昨日某某兩廠又訂定三船澳麥、合價祇四兩二錢三分云、</p>
<p>絲茶　法莊補充乾經缺貨、</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲巿、仍趨呆滯、黄白廠經、海外去電仍不見轉、而外滙平定、昨祇法莊補充乾經缺貨、計達昌等進七里乾大經二十五包、價仍堅挺云、</p>
<h3>無錫白廠經運滬寥落</h3>
<p>昨（三十一）日爲七月份洋莊期絲交解最後一日、白廠經美銷停滯已久、英法抛額亦甚有限、類均現貨需要、是以本月份白廠經期貨交解額幾成弩末、無錫各廠運滬絲額、均甚寥落、截至昨日止、錫廠經運滬數量共祇二百包左右云、</p>
<p>南北貨　蘭竹枝地價漲七元</p>
<p>▲烏葉枝升拾元</p>
<p>蘭竹枝因他價又漲六七元、烏葉枝升拾元、來源轉稀、昨招商局之圖南輪入口、運到五百餘箱、其中轉口者百數箱、故申巿僅四百餘箱、以地價合劃、已需五十六兩之　、號盤勢必連增、泉元紅枝昨亦有到、當即開出、價爲六十五兩左右、趨勢穏俏、</p>
<p>五金　英美平白鐵出路鋭進</p>
<p>▲巿塲槪况　昨巿五金交易、北帮烟台·天津　　諸帮進胃良好、而長江一帶、採辦亦廣、故趨勢良好、但抵制後英美平白鐵出路甚盛、日貨則祇能門莊零估、出口希望堪云完全斷絶云、</p>
<p>英白鐵存底一空　英白鐵因購者猛盛、出路大旺、致積存多日之巿貨、被購一空、行情十分挺秀、如四十八張售十六兩五錢、三十八張十六兩七錢半、三十三張十五兩八錢、二十五張十五兩二錢半、聞昨巿開出達六七百擔之多云、</p>
<p>▲美白鐵步趨佳境　美白鐵交易、邇來亦有步趨佳境之槪、雖標準一時無飛黄騰達之、象然比之先前則已高起錢餘、如四十八張售十九兩二錢半、三十八張十九兩五錢、三十三張十八兩七錢半、二十五張十七兩九錢、</p>
<p>▲英鋼板走勢較强　英鋼板昨日牛莊·大連·天津諸帮、均下手買進、巿象頓呈樂觀、蓋各帮走勢較强、則此後無貨滿之患、行情因人心尙好故未見有提升之消息云、</p>
<p>雜訉　茶葉二千箱今日運印度、</p>

<h3>三等要人及其它</h3>
<p>— 都美</p>
<p>這兩天的生活、才是我夢想不到的哩、無形中、竟使我變成了要人、滬杭間來往了四次之多、不過、我這要人也者、畢竟與普通所謂要人、有點兩樣、普通所謂要人、起碼是頭等車、或則臥車、花車、而我這要人呢、可只是乘的三等、好、那麽不妨就自贈一個頭銜、一三等要人」罷、若再講到要人的本質呢、要人其所以稱爲要人者、他所來往從事者、不外是要事、而我所幹的呢、却是茶役之類的事情、何要之有、但退一步講、設此事非我不可、那我又顯然是要人了、所以、照這樣看起來、我依然不失其爲要人、只是、頭上脱不了一個冠辭—「三等」、</p>
<p>前天是受了一位與我們有幾層關係的人—親戚、同鄕、弟弟的同學、同是又是他的朋友、—丁君去浙江大學報名、本來在上海是可通函報名的　但這項規定、已於前一日—十四日—停止了、於是不得不「要吃龍肉、親自下海、」丁君如果眞的親自報名嗎、那末一則須要預備功課、不能擅自亂跑、二則他對於旅行是不甚慣熟的、這樣、代盡這義務的、似乎是只有我了、找别人、這樣熱天、誰高興來攬這差使、於是不待丁君開口、便實行毛遂自薦了、</p>
<p>打算乘七點十分車、在六點二十分、便立在公共汽車站候車、誰料過去有五部之多、而無一部到北站去的、可就急煞我了、這時、再呌黄包車是絶對來不及了、因爲頭班車在一點到、我想當日趕兩點鐘的一班回來、如果呌我犠牲這班火車、實在心中不甘、兩眼只是焦急地向北翹望着、加之站旁的巡捕、（因爲每逢等車都得遇見他、似乎已是熟人了、）他時時告我多少鐘點了、因此我更心急似火、終算未脱車、到了北站、還有十分鐘哩、　　一路眞能氣煞我也、車廂裏人山人海、不知怎麽欠注意、坐到一個領有三個小孩的女人旁邊、右邊呢、是一個帶北方面貌的大塊頭的男人、我當然不便向這面擠去、我的身子總偏向左邊、可是那位女人、顯然是覺得不高興、故意向我擠來、意想把我排擠掉、但我猜到她的用心、偏生不調位置、不過、受足了那三個孩子的煩惱、一時爬上爬下、一時吃這樣那樣、那女人同行的、還有順次挨下去七八個人、男女老少都有、由服色舉動、談吐、我斷盡他們非上色人物、後來那個女人简直乾脆地將外衣卸去、僅僅着一件對襟的小襯衫、一面忙着戲弄着孩子、一面不斷地將瓜、蛋、麵包等向嘴裏塞、同道的另一個男人總是現着一付猙獰而令人可惡的笑容、在不絶地讚美着目今物質的文明、</p>
<p>「眞笑話、現在的人简直是活神仙、能夠騰雲駕霧、早上人在上海、馬上就可到杭州了、他媽的、只要有錢、還有、現在打仗也容易了、運起槍　軍隊來、乖乖、一天好運幾百里路哩……」</p>
<p>開口一個「他媽的」、閉口一個「乖乖」、道來洋洋自得、津津有味、其餘那幾個一面抽着烟捲、嗑着瓜子、洗耳恭聽、逐漸頷首、表示讚嘆他所發的一番議論、</p>
<p>可憐呵、中國的物質文明　　在那裏、除了這僅僅的幾條鐵道和可以通航的水道外、其餘的大半部分、還不是依然陸路用騾車、牛車、以及獨輪的人力車等、水路也仍然是行帆船、用人力拉、他們當然不知道歐美各國的物質文明、交通是怎樣的便利、但是他們也和我們生長在同一個地方、不過一點知識程度的關係、竟使他們成功了十足的井底蛙、當時我不以他們那些蠢話爲可笑、只是頓生無限莫名的感慨與驚觸、同時、我更想到「知足常樂」道一句陳語、他們對於中國如此的物質生活已經表示十分知足了、所以他才有上面的那番讚嘆、</p>
<p>報名後剛趕至車站、兩點另八分的車已不待我而先行了、我感到非常的悵惘、這班車脱掉、要到六點才再有哩、我將怎樣消磨這四個鐘頭呢、我惟心口在自商、—哦、媽不是老早關照過的嗎、「杭州籃子好、幾時去替我買兩個有蓋的密藍、盛荸薺等、風得又甜又不爛、老鼠又吃不到、」—呵、媽媽慈祥的吩咐、立刻重映上腦膜、於是主意拿定了、先到飯館裏吃飯、再雇車往湖濱公園小坐、</p>
<p>「來路貨、」</p>
<p>「泊來品、」</p>
<p>「不是本地的、」</p>
<p>「外來户兒、」</p>
<p>坐在湖濱公園不到一刻鐘的工夫、一陣陣那些不三不四的男人、三三五五地走過我面前時、自言自語地説着、你説他們是流氓、不敢斷定、若説不是吧、爲什麽這般無聊、來往的女人們雖不咕嚕什麽、但也拿出一副出神的樣子來注視着我、賣東西的都來爭着呌我購買、結果、竟使我討厭起來、他們好似見我地生人疏、故意來欺侮我的、不得已只好促我早點和那可愛的西子姑娘告别、</p>
<p>籃買好了、時計告訴我、才四點半、此刻就到車站、是會被人取笑的、於是再去買傘、爲了想耽誤些時間起見、故意和那老者講價錢、説廢話、結果分文不曾用掉、委實我醉翁之意不在酒、虧得那裏不是閙忙的大街、得了店主的同意、索性坐在那裏翻看新近的小説月報、</p>
<p>好福相、眞不愧是要人的太太、我不禁暗暗稱讚着、</p>
<p>大排的警士、肉屏風般地在車站裏陳列着、隊長（？）時時發出很莊嚴沉重的口令、警士們跟着向左向右成立正、我正在猜不到爲的什麽要如此、忽然隊長的口令更宏亮起來、警士們隨着口令便心管鼻、鼻管心地立起正來、接着有兩位護兵、保護了一羣出來、都是些衣冠齊整—講句神經作用的話、儀表也似整齊的人們、其中只有一位女客、這女客生得極爲富膄、白藕般的手膀上、套着一只内圓外方翡翠鐲、當然是爲吾人注目了、這時全站的待車客人、若干隻的目光、咸集中到那羣整潔的人們、尤其是那位女太太、不待言這是某要人的起程、由一簇簇耳語中、我得知那位要人是蔣作賓、那女客當然是他的太太了、不過、那太太的福相、至今仍在我腦中、留下深刻的素描、</p>
<p>次晨、弟弟來我宿舍、向我商酌、又有一位關係並不亞於丁君與我們的人、也想投考浙大、報名却又來光　到我、弟弟雖然怕我辛苦過度、但義不容辭、終於允許了、這便是造成我這要人的要素、</p>
<p>「　、好她連乘了兩天早車從上海趕來、」我走進該校報名處、那班職員在這般竊議着、我聽了、眞不知作何感想好、兩點　車顯然是過了、於是得到該　一位先生的同　、在辦公室的一隅、打開小皮箱取出我預計幹的工作—寫好一　隨筆的稿子、</p>
<p>再到車站時、看不見警士們的肉屏了、可是、昨晩站前的一幕、立刻又浮上我的腦際、使我回憶起那是要人的起程、</p>

<h3>舊金山印刷業女領袖</h3>
<p>— 朱玉相</p>
<p>是一位美國婦女商業人才　赤手空拳奮鬥到今日地位</p>
<p>當曼麗瑪肯夫人被東家强行辭歇的時候、回顧十九年來心力勞瘁的服務、盡付流水、滿懷抑　、無處宣洩、是怎樣底痛苦可憐呢、然而、現在她却終日沈醉在愉快中了、因爲今日她已變成舊金山印刷業的領袖人物、而且獨資設立着一家規模很大的印刷公司、她的奮鬥成功、光榮而可貴、極足誇炫於人、在舊金山地方、女子自出私資、經營一種大商業、而並非得之於父親丈夫或是兄弟的遺産、曼麗瑪肯夫人简直是空前第一人、</p>
<p>是二十四年以前的事了、一位年靑婦人、獨自從波蘭的梅茵地方、跋涉長途、到美國加利福尼省去找求她的佳運、在那時候、她唯一的商業上的經騐、祇是坐在家裏、寫作一些廣告文字和繪圖、在舊金山那樣大的城巿裏、曼麗瑪肯夫人十分貧困地、連一個熟識的人都没有、幸而不久她便在居處附近、找到一家印刷公司、接着在那公司裏、要求得一個小小職位、當時薪水是每星期美金六元、</p>
<p>歲月好像流水一般消逝、曼麗瑪肯夫人已經改入美籍了、她的薪金也逐漸地而且穏固地增高起來、最後、除了正式的薪水以外、公司裏每年還另給她一筆額外的津貼、</p>
<p>同時、她又被選爲舊金山商會的第一任婦女會員、按月領着一份豐厚的公費、這樣、她的收入、更增加了不少、儘可以比得上美國任何婦人所能賺到的鉅數、但是公司裏的經理、對她漸起嫉忌、不久便很無情地把她辭歇了、雖然她在那裏、已有十九年功蹟顯著的歷史、</p>
<p>在極度的哀怨憤鬰之中、曼麗瑪肯夫人力自振作、她毅决地集攏歷來的積蓄、計劃着自己創辦一家印刷公司、她購置了一座三層樓的大屋、作爲廠址、印刷機器、都是最新式的、其他一切設備、也異常完美、門外掛着這麽一塊招牌、「曼麗瑪肯印刷公司」、</p>
<p>由於她十九年來、在印刷業所博得的深厚的資望、以及豐富的經騐、再加一副非常靈敏的手腕、所以、不過五年之間、瑪肯印刷公司的業務、已到極發達的地步、每日所承接的各項生意、自卡片和電影説明書、以至於精裝的書籍、莫不應有盡有、因此在今日的美國、人們如果談起舊金山的印刷業、没有不知道曼麗瑪肯夫人的、而實際上、她也確乎隠然是一位舊金山印刷業的女領袖了、</p>
<p>在百忙之中、她除了力謀發展公司業務以外、還時時刻刻偷空致力於社會事業、今日在舊金山巿近郊的海磯山麓有一片廣大的草原、專供巿内兒童在假期内作爲露宿塲地的、名義上雖説是巿有公産、其實、在若干年以前、是由曼麗瑪肯夫人出資購地、開闢好了之後、才捐作市産的、這是她對於市内兒童娛樂的一點貢獻、</p>
<p>另外、她還是加省職業婦女俱樂部的部長、同時、她在婦女參政聯盟及國民女子聯合會這兩個婦女團體内、也都佔有極重要的位置、不多幾年以前、美國女靑年會、特地派她來到中國、作一次社會考察、關於中國婦女及兒童的現狀方面、她曾得不少新消息、貢獻給她自己國内、</p>

<h3>實用銀行尺牘</h3>
<p>— 靈鳳</p>
<p>胡治藩著</p>
<p>尺牘是文學中一種專門技能、商業尺牘、更是别具風格、儘有才華澹宕的詞人、對於商舖子裏一封简單的書信、有無從下筆之感、至於銀行尺牘、更是絶對的專門、有許多銀行業務上所發生的名詞、自非業外人所可了解、</p>
<p>我國出版界、除了部私人應用的秋水軒尺牘以外、關於商業用的尺牘書、可説寥寥可數、究其原因、却是我國商人、只覺得寫信是一件麻煩而至不足重的事情、惜墨如金、不到萬不得已的時候、是不肯輕易動筆、他們不明白商業信件、除了牠本身傳達事實的使命外、還能夠拉攏天下多少漠不相識的顧客、所以歐美各國商店裏的文書股、在全店中佔極重要的位置、他們不必見到顧客的面、憑着一纸八行書、儘足以引誘買主、來欣賞他們的貨物、</p>
<p>他們旣明白通信做生意的重要意義、（Doing　Business　By　Mail）便極力研究商業尺牘的組織、如何使牠简單明瞭、不要絮絮叨叨討顧客的厭、同時要寫得有力量、有意思、爲適應這種需求、於是商業尺牘的出版物、便風發雲湧、而成商業學校的一種重要課程、</p>
<p>可是那些都是普通商業信札、祇合於百貨舖子之用、專門關於银行業務的、還是没有、本書的著者、鑒於我國银行的發展、與需用這類著作的急切、本其經騐所得、著成了這部書、這裏頭包含着一百封簡易流利的英文信、凡是在日常銀行業務上所發生的函件、可算得無格不備、内中像存放欵·押欵·進出口·電匯票匯等、分門别類、封封俱有實用、而可以做銀行家的藍本、也是商業學生研求銀行系的必讀之書、趁着這書再版的當兒、特爲介紹幾句、代售處各埠商務印書館·羣益書社·文明書局等處、</p>

<h3>職業敎育 (一)</h3>
<p>Vocational Education (I)</p>
<p>The National Vocational Education Discussion Conference, with over two hundred and thirty educational leaders from nineteen provinces and regions nationwide gathered in Zhenjiang today to discuss the important issue of how to integrate education with society, that is, how to make education vocational and practical, exerting its great power in enriching individual lives, developing national livelihoods, and supporting social survival. This is truly an event in our country's education that is highly worthy of our attention today.</p>
<p>Our country today, due to the people's lack of scientific knowledge and backward production, the social phenomenon that is presented before us is, on the one hand, the decline of industry, the desolation of farmland, and insufficient food and clothing, resulting in a poor and weak country and a tired and distressed people, which breeds chaos. On the other hand, most secondary education institutions nationwide have failed to take into account the realistic situation of society and its realistic needs, failing to consider the appropriate lives of most young people and their skills to obtain a livelihood. The courses offered are all preparations for higher education and advanced research. Although there are some subjects related to industry and agriculture, they are mostly empty and superficial, and rely solely on book-based and dead instruction, without active practice. They emphasize the use of the brain but not the hands. Therefore, most students, upon graduating from school, are trapped by their family circumstances and unable to pursue higher education, and they lack specialized skills and have no way to find work. Moreover, they have a very high self-regard and disdain to engage in labor-intensive work in industry and agriculture. Thus, with no use for their brains and no ability with their hands, they sit idly by consuming without producing, and become high-level idlers in society.</p>
<p>Looking at the above two phenomena, on the one hand, there is backward production and the people suffer from poverty, and on the other hand, the people are unable to produce. In fact, the latter is the cause of the former, and the former is the result of the latter. To remedy this, promoting vocational education and reforming secondary education to solve the poverty of society and the livelihood of individuals are the most important measures.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen once said, "The purpose of schools, in addition to reading, writing, learning, and knowledge, should focus on the hands and strive for practicality." What is meant by "hands" and "strive for practicality" is the location of production, the location of livelihood, and the location of vocational education. The Educational Implementation Guidelines promulgated by the central government also clearly stipulate that "general education must cultivate the people's life skills and increase the people's production capacity." Cultivating life skills is to solve the livelihood of individuals, and increasing production capacity is to solve the poverty of the country. The way to achieve this is to implement vocational education. Therefore, promoting vocational education and training the people's life skills is an urgent and indispensable method for our country to rise from decline and remedy our shortcomings. The Ministry of Education previously issued a circular restricting the establishment of ordinary middle schools and adding vocational schools, in which it painfully denounced the impracticality of middle school education today, saying, "If we continue unchanged, we will see the exhaustion of people's livelihood and the collapse of society without any end." The words are both painful and pertinent.</p>
<p>The central government has issued regulations for implementation, and the Ministry of Education has issued circulars for implementation within a time limit. But how can we ensure that it is implemented, and how can we ensure that it is effective? We sincerely hope that the gentlemen at this Vocational Education Discussion Conference can make practical and concrete contributions.</p>

<p>Germany's Cumulative Reparation Payments</p>
<p>Reach £87 Million</p>
<p>Briand Overworked</p>

<p>▲Reuter, Berlin, 30th - German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius will visit Weimar on Wednesday and Thursday at the invitation of the Italian government.</p>
<p>▲Reuter, Berlin, 30th - New five-mark silver coins are about to be minted, with a value of £5 million, to alleviate the shortage of money.</p>
<p>▲Reuter, London, 30th - The Financial Secretary stated in the House of Commons today that from the armistice to September 1924, Germany paid a total of approximately £37 million in accordance with the treaty, with very little foreign debt. Since the implementation of the Dawes Plan, Germany has paid approximately £50 million in reparations and borrowed approximately £36 million in long-term foreign debt. As for short-term loans, it is estimated by official circles to be approximately £36 million.</p>
<p>▲Reuter, Paris, 30th - The Paris Association of Antiquarian Booksellers and Art Dealers has proposed a novel plan to help Germany, proposing to lend Germany £8 million, with the famous paintings currently in the exhibition rooms in Berlin and other places as collateral.

<p>Zeppelin Airship</p>
<h3>Report on Arctic Exploration</h3>
<p>▲ Great Contribution to the Scientific Community</p>
<p>▲ Berlin Dispatch, 30th Day of the Month: The Graf Zeppelin airship returned from its Arctic exploration tonight. The audience exceeded previous records. All those entering the welcoming area had to pay an entrance fee ranging from 50 pfennigs to 3 marks to supplement the cost of the expedition. Representatives from the German Federal Government, the Prussian Government, and the Berlin Municipal Government all gave speeches, highly praising the success of the exploration. Their speeches were broadcast throughout Germany. The expedition leader, Eckener, and the scientific team leader, Professor Zhamm Luoweiqi, gave detailed reports of the journey. Professor Sai said that the achievements of this two-day expedition would have taken many years to achieve under the old methods. He also expressed hope that a larger international expedition could set off in the future, as the cost of such explorations could not be borne by private individuals or organizations alone. Professor Sai also mentioned that they had been delayed for too long in Franz Josef Land, which prevented the completion of the entire planned itinerary. This was because the terrain was very different from what was shown on current maps, so it was necessary to re-survey the area, which took 24 hours. After surveying Franz Josef Land, the Graf Zeppelin expedition went to Nicholas II Land. The actual terrain of the island was larger than commonly known and rich in minerals and coal, making it very worthwhile to revisit. However, due to insufficient fuel in the airship, they were unable to visit New Siberian Island, which was on the planned itinerary. They turned back towards Leningrad but were hindered by storms and could not stop in Leningrad. They only dropped off mail and left. Overall, the scientific success of this trip exceeded expectations. Even German newspapers are now very optimistic about this type of lighter-than-air flying object. Furthermore, the findings of this expedition not only made great contributions to meteorology, geology, and Arctic exploration experience, but also made significant contributions to the invention of wireless communication. This is because a certain area in the Arctic is almost a silent spot on Earth. Within that area, wireless communication loses its effectiveness, and internal and external telephone calls cannot be transmitted. During this trip, the Zeppelin airship was hindered from communicating with the outside world for as long as 30 hours. However, clear communication between Berlin and Tokyo could be heard.</p>
<p>▲ Friedrichshafen Dispatch, 31st Day of the Month: The Zeppelin airship returned here at dawn today, having traveled 9,000 miles in one week since its departure.</p>
<p>▲ Moscow Dispatch: American aviators, Herndon and Pangborn, who are circumnavigating the world, arrived here at 11:52 this morning. They intend to break the record recently set by Gatty and Post, who flew around the world in eight and a half days.</p>
<p>▲ New Record for Non-Stop Flight</p>
<p>▲ Constantinople Dispatch, 30th Day of the Month: American aviators Boardman and Polando, who departed from New York on Tuesday morning at 5:00 AM, crossed the Atlantic Ocean and arrived here at 1:16 PM today. They set a new world record for long-distance flight by flying 4,984 miles non-stop in 47 hours and 36 minutes. They were greeted by a large crowd.</p>
<h3>Chen Youren Lobbies Japan</h3>
<p>Met with Shidehara and Discussed Pan-Asianism at Length</p>
<p>▲ Reuter Dispatch, 31st Day of the Month, Tokyo: Although a government spokesman denied reports that Foreign Minister Shidehara had spoken with Chen Youren, he implied that Shidehara had met with Chen Youren. A summary of their conversation will be sent to Shigemitsu Aoi, the acting ambassador to China, to be forwarded to the Nanjing government. It is reported that Chen Youren lobbied Japan to express sympathy for Guangzhou and to advocate closer cooperation between China and Japan to promote Pan-Asianism. He cited Sun Yat-sen's last speech as justification. Shidehara, in addition to firmly stating that Japan's policy is to avoid interfering in China's internal affairs, did not comment on Chen's remarks.</p>
<h3>Someone is Smuggling Arms into China</h3>
<p>Authorities in the Philippines Receive Advance Notice</p>
<p>▲ San Francisco Dispatch, 3rd Day of the Month: Police here have received reports that someone is plotting to smuggle a batch of machine guns and other military supplies to the Philippines and are currently investigating. According to police speculation, these arms are likely to be transferred to ships in the Philippines and transported to China. The fact that this information was initially leaked by Chinese people makes it even more credible.</p>
<p>▲ Manila Dispatch, 31st Day of the Month: Police authorities announced today that a certain large trading company had inquired with the police station about regulations governing firearms, especially those related to the import of firearms. They were informed that the import and transportation of firearms are subject to strict restrictions. It was also learned that a certain large sugar merchant had ordered 25 machine guns with the intention of shipping them to China. This is likely related to the investigation being conducted by the San Francisco police. Given the strict restrictions imposed by the police and customs, it is unlikely that these arms will be shipped here.</p>
<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>Telegram from Beiping: To all newspapers, we have just received a telegram in response to Chairman Chiang, which reads: "We received your telegram of the other day and respectfully acknowledge its contents. We believe that the current situation is fraught with internal and external troubles, extremely precarious. The facts have been presented, and there is no need to enumerate them. Anyone who is a citizen, unless they are extremely foolish, must be vigilant in time, clearly understand the advantages and disadvantages of the future, and jointly save the nation from peril. Ever since you took command and personally managed the dangers, you have worked tirelessly to eliminate the enemy for the country, worrying from dawn till dusk. You have also repeatedly consoled and alerted your fellow countrymen, sparing no effort to speak out. All of this fighting spirit and thorough discourse is more than enough to set an example for the masses and inspire their consciences. Who would have thought that the military campaign to suppress the communists, with success within reach, would be disrupted by the insane actions of traitors, who seized the opportunity to rebel? Their intention is to eradicate the last remaining vital force of our country to achieve their selfish goals. Such actions are not only a betrayal of the party and the country but also a separation from the people. We are willing to serve as your bodyguards, accept your teachings, and remain highly motivated. As long as we live, we vow not to coexist under the same sky with traitors who harm the country. We are ready to fight and respectfully express our sincere sentiments. We ask for your kind consideration."

<p>Telegram from Kaifeng: To all newspapers, the nation must seek unification before there can be any talk of politics, and the government must establish discipline before there can be any hope of unification. Since the promulgation of the provisional constitution, the country has been well-governed, the people's hearts have been stabilized, and the nation is eager for good governance. Who would have thought that Shi Yousan, who disregards discipline and undermines unification, would emerge and shamelessly rebel and cause chaos? The military and civilians of all provinces are deeply indignant. Shi Yousan is known for his cruelty, love of disorder, lack of integrity, and constant betrayals. He treats the national law like a discarded shoe, considers defection as his ability, started a rebellion in Pukou and shocked the capital. When Yan and Feng rebelled against the country, he was their vanguard. Then, when Yan and Feng were about to collapse, he retreated to northern Henan to collect their weapons and strengthen his own power. His constant changes of heart are all for his own benefit. Last winter, he pledged allegiance to the vice-commander, who made efforts to mediate, and expressed his submission to the central government, which generously accommodated him. Who knew that the heart of a wolf is difficult to tame, and the heart of a bandit never dies? He then recruited bandits, plundered the people's wealth, colluded with foreign enemies, and became the henchman of imperialists, disregarding everything in order to carry out his schemes. Kindness is not enough to win his heart, and integrity cannot overcome his desires. When he is in dire straits, he surrenders, and when the time comes, he turns against you. As a result, the nation's unification has repeatedly failed at the verge of success, and the disaster of the people's suffering has been prolonged indefinitely. Tracing back the root causes of the past few years of disaster, how could it not be due to the treachery and fickleness of people like Shi Yousan? Recently, the commander-in-chief entered Jiangxi to supervise the suppression of the communists, enduring the hardships of the hot weather and venturing into dangerous areas. All of us comrades should unite our efforts and overcome difficulties together. Moreover, at a time when disasters occur frequently and there are many troubles on the borders, the nation is in danger, hanging by a thread. We should not wield the sword against each other or stage a play within the walls, giving outsiders an opportunity to exploit us and causing endless worries for our country. How can he think that his old tricks can be repeated and that the time cannot be missed? He only seeks his own personal power and does not hesitate to use the country as a last resort. Such a dead-end, retrograde, insane, and gloating act is abandoned by the people and not tolerated by the national law. If we allow him to jump around and do not eliminate him, the harm he will cause to the country and the poison he will spread in society will be unimaginable. If Qingfu is not eliminated, the troubles of Lu will not end. Thinking of this makes one's heart tremble. Now, the central government is enduring the pain to eliminate the traitors and has issued a clear order for their suppression. Friendly troops from all sides are jointly carrying out the suppression. We, as soldiers, have the responsibility to defend the country, and we are filled with righteous indignation, anxious day and night. We have now obeyed the orders of the central government, supervising the troops to advance and suppress them. We are united in our efforts and will not coexist under the same sky with those who undermine unification and disregard discipline. We hope that military and civilian officials, comrades, and old friends in all provinces will have the same heart in eliminating this harmful horse and work together to attack, so as to stabilize the foundation of the country and block the source of chaos. The party and the nation will be fortunate. We have hastily expressed our sentiments and await your clear instructions.

<h3>A Study of Korean Migration to the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Continuation 9) Bin</p>
<p>(2) Unlimited Expansion of Japanese Police Power: Wherever Koreans set foot in our Northeast, Japanese police power expands along with them. Japanese often instigate unscrupulous elements among Korean residents to engage in various illegal activities that endanger our country. We have no way to stop them. For example, in mid-April of this year, Wu Renhua, a translator at the Anti-Communist Affairs Office of the Northeast Border Defense Army's Deputy Commander's Office in Jilin, was shot and killed by a Japanese Korean, Jin Zhengyuan. Afterwards, Jin Zhengyuan took refuge in the Japanese consulate. After repeated negotiations, there were no results. The case remains unresolved. For example, American journalist Mr. Colorwell investigated that under the protection and connivance of the Japanese police, Japanese and Korean residents in Harbin actually used the Japanese post office in the Manchurian Railway Zone to send opium, morphine, heroin and other drugs. Dedicated persons were also sent to sell them along the China Eastern Railway. In Anda alone, there were more than 60 semi-public places set up by Japanese and Koreans to sell drugs. If our authorities arrest them, the Japanese police will intervene, and the Japanese consul will protest, so there is no way to prohibit them. Eventually, drugs spread everywhere. All these illegal acts and improper businesses of the Koreans occur under the connivance of the Japanese police and the protection of Japanese legal authority. There are accumulated cases that cannot be resolved.</p>
<p>(3) Nationality Disputes of Korean Residents: The Tanaka Memorial, quoted earlier, states: "... The naturalized Koreans, although nominally naturalized citizens of China, will soon return to our nationality... This is only because of temporary convenience that they become citizens of China.... In addition, among the Koreans in Manchuria and Mongolia, some have naturalized as citizens of China, while others have not. When the time comes, whether it is Korean citizens of Chinese nationality who cause trouble or Korean citizens of Japanese nationality who cause trouble, we can use the strategy of 'selling dog meat under the banner of sheep's head' to deal with it..." These words are no less than a confession of the Japanese conspiracy to use Koreans with dual nationality to disturb us. Today, as soon as Koreans enter our country, they form villages. Within a village, naturalized and non-naturalized residents live together. The good people can still cultivate the land to support themselves. Those who are cunning and sly will act recklessly and do anything. They live on our land and eat our food. But if we exercise our ruling power, they will instigate the non-naturalized residents to resist. If we treat them as outside the law, they will claim Chinese nationality and openly rent and buy land. Even worse, most Koreans have already naturalized in our country and are also registered as Japanese nationals at the same time. One person has dual nationality. These Koreans are sometimes Chinese and sometimes Japanese, changing constantly, all following the instructions of the Japanese. When land disputes and civil and criminal lawsuits occur between Koreans and Chinese in the Northeast, Koreans often rely on their dual nationality status to seek the protection of the Japanese. They are instigated by the Japanese to undermine our country's judiciary. Conversely, if Koreans commit crimes in Korea, they often use the Eastern Provinces as a place of refuge. Japanese soldiers often clash with our people when arresting Koreans, causing our people to suffer various unexpected damages. Koreans seek convenience by holding dual nationality, and the Japanese take advantage of this to create excuses to plot attacks. This is insidious and malicious, and it is especially harmful to the Northeast.</p>
<p>(4) Koreans Disturbing Local Security: Most of the Koreans who have migrated to our Northeast are poor. Many of them are able to work hard in agriculture, but there are also many who willingly become bandits and rely on the protection of Japanese police power to undermine the security of our Northeast. Their firearms have a Japanese source, and their concealment is protected by the Japanese. It is difficult for our local authorities to investigate and govern them.</p>
<p>There is nothing we can do about them. Koreans get the name, we get the harm, and the Japanese applaud from the side, deeply rejoicing in the success of their plan.</p>
<p>In summary, the harm that Korean migration causes to our Northeast can already be seen. The future is long, and the troubles will be endless. Therefore, can our country not quickly devise countermeasures for remedy? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Further News on the Communist Suppression Army Recapturing Donggu</h3>
<p>▲ Besieged and Attacked by Over 200,000 Troops</p>
<p>▲ Cai Tingkai Led His Troops to Enter Donggu First</p>
<p>▲ The Communist Nest Was Completely Destroyed by the Various Armies</p>
<p>▲ The Remaining Communist Troops Fled Towards Ruijin and Yudu</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The situation of the recapture of Donggu has been reported in yesterday's news. Now, more detailed information has been obtained, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Looking back at the Communist Suppression Army's plan, the goal was to eliminate the main force of the Red Bandits. Therefore, the right wing and the central route advanced to the communist nests in Donggu, Wangpi, Luokou, Xiaopu, Longgang, and Shaxi. The progress was initially very slow, while the officers and soldiers of the left wing, which encircled the Red Bandits on the border of Jiangxi and Fujian, advanced lightly and quickly, traveling over a hundred li or seventy or eighty li per day. After taking Ningdu and entering Xingguo to the southeast of Donggu, they cut off the Red Bandits' retreat to the south. The right wing and the central route then rushed towards the communist nests. Therefore, within a few days, they suddenly recaptured the deeply rooted old nest of the Red Bandits in Donggu. After the Communist Suppression Army captured Shicheng and Ningdu, the Red Bandits, except for the two units of Zhu De and Xiang Ying, who fled into Tingzhou and Ninghua in Fujian, Peng Dehuai and Mao Zedong, entrenched themselves in Ruijin, Yudu, and Dongshanba. In the battles of Wenhui, Xianrenqiao, and Shicheng, the Peng Mao bandits retreated to Shaxi, Longgang, Dongshao, Luokou, and Wangpi, and joined forces with the pseudo-army of Gu Daozhong and Li Wenlin, who were guarding the old nest, in an attempt to make a final stand. At that time, Commander-in-Chief Chiang ordered He Yingqin and Chen Mingshu to lead the group armies of the left and right wings to encircle and suppress them on a large scale. He and Chen made separate arrangements. The first route army of the left wing, Zhao Guantao's troops, advanced from Ningdu to Gulonggang in Xingguo, and then advanced north from Qingtangkantian, the intersection of Ningdu, Yudu, and Xingguo, directly attacking the old nest of the Red Bandits in Wangpi and Xiaopu, north of Ningdu, taking the form of a pincer attack with Sun Lianzhong's troops from the central route from Le'an to Ningdu. The second route army advanced from Ningdu and Yudu to Jiangkou, cutting off the path for the Red Bandits to flee to Ruijin. Then, they went west from Liangcun and Yuexi in Yongfeng to attack Longgang. At the same time, Zhu Shaoliang of the Third Army sent a part of his troops to launch a fierce attack on Luokou via Toupi, the northwestern border of Guangchang. Gao Shuxun's troops took Wangpi and Xiaopu. The Second and Tenth Armies of the Fourth Army Corps were deployed in Shicheng, Ningdu, Ruijin, and the Fujian border to block the bandits in Donggu from fleeing south into Fujian and to prevent side attacks from the bandits in Ninghua, Tingzhou, and Ruijin. The right-wing army, with the Jiang and Cai divisions of the 19th Route Army as the main force attacking Donggu, went straight from Futian to Donggu. Sun Lianzhong's 25th and 27th Divisions attacked from Yihuang and Le'an to the north of Ningdu and the east of Yongfeng to surround the east of Donggu. The Hao Mengling and Han Deqin units of the Third Route Army took Baishui, Shuikou, Tengtian, Baisha, Shaxi, and Shima from Jishui and Yongfeng to attack Tantou and approach the north of Donggu. At the same time, the 19th Route Army also sent a part of its troops to bypass Xingguo and join Luo's army from Taihe to put pressure on the west of Donggu from Chengjiang Tiantu. Chiang Tingwen led the 9th and 23rd Divisions as a reserve force at the southeastern border. After the above deployments were completed, the general attack order was issued on the 23rd. A total of more than 200,000 troops were mobilized. When they advanced to the vicinity of the communist nests, the Huang Gonglue and Lin Biao bandit armies took advantage of the dangerous terrain and pre-built fortifications to resist the Communist Suppression Army from high ground with firearms. The Communist Suppression Army fought one after another. The battles of Longgang and Luokou were extremely fierce. The sounds of machine guns, cannons, rifles, and grenades were mixed together, like the big and small cannons of the New Year. However, the Communist Suppression Army's air force soared through the sky, using message bags to report the location of the bandit's main force and the direction of advance. The fortifications of the communist nests were also bombed and destroyed by the planes. The Red Bandits suffered heavy casualties. By the 25th and 26th, the left wing first recaptured the communist nests of Huangpi, Xiaopu, Dongshan, and Luokou, killing countless bandits. The bodies of the bandits were strewn everywhere, most of whom were peasant bandits. On the right wing, the Li Yunjie units of Shangguan Yunxiang's forces in the Third Route Army first defeated about one division of Huang Gonglue's forces and occupied Shaxi. Then, they suddenly and unexpectedly infiltrated from Xiagu Cangqian to the back of the bandit camp in light clothing. At this time, Cai Tingkai led the First Army Corps directly from Shanggu to Longgang, and taking advantage of the victory, moved westward with lightning speed and captured Donggu at 1:00 PM on the 27th. When the bandits occupying the nest, such as Wu Zhonghao's pseudo-army, came out to resist, they engaged Cai's division in a close-quarters battle. When the two sides were fighting hand-to-hand, the teams of the Communist Suppression Army surrounding Donggu rushed in like surging tides. Moreover, the key points and contact points of Donggu were cut off by the Communist Suppression Army. The Red Bandits were unable to respond to each other and were completely annihilated. According to news from the Forward Headquarters, a total of more than 30,000 Red Army peasant bandits, militia, and spear teams, both male and female, were captured in the Battle of Donggu. 14,000 to 15,000 土 guns, rifles, and broken and miscellaneous firearms, as well as other weapons, important documents, and oil, salt, rice, and grain robbed by the Red Bandits, were seized. The various pseudo-organs of the Red Bandits were immediately destroyed without remainder, and the hostages who had been kidnapped were released. Also, the Forward Headquarters reported that in the battles of Huangpi and other places, in addition to countless bandits killed, at least 50,000 hostages were released, peasant bandits were disbanded, and bandits were captured successively. Although a small number of bandits fled to Xingguo and Yudu, trying to escape from Ruijin and Xiangzhou, the Communist Suppression Army had made careful arrangements in advance and planned to intercept and wipe them out in Gulonggang and other places. The three prisoner-of-war camps in Linchuan, Ji'an, and Nanchang are being actively prepared for establishment by the Party and Government Council to actively receive the wounded soldiers. Corpses are being buried, and the Red Cross teams sent from Shanghai have set off to Nanfeng, Ji'an, Ningdu, and Donggu to treat the wounded soldiers. (July 28)</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Actively筹办 Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram to Chiang Requesting Expedited Issuance of Disaster Relief Bonds of Ten Million</p>
<p>▲ Presentation to the Executive Yuan Requesting Prior Allocation of One to Two Million in 現欵</p>
<p>This summer's continuous rains have caused disasters, and statistics show that the disaster areas across the country have reached the extent of sixteen provinces, with more than fifty million disaster victims. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Affairs Committee, is now urgently seeking relief. Yesterday, he specifically sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang and the Executive Yuan, requesting the issuance of disaster relief bonds of ten million yuan, and also requesting the prior allocation of 現欵 for urgent relief. The telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Chairman Chiang: To His Excellency Chairman Chiang of the Nanchang General Headquarters 行營: I, your servant, report that recently, continuous rains have persisted, and the floods in various provinces have expanded, brewing an unprecedented catastrophe. This committee has repeatedly received urgent requests for assistance from provinces such as Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi. In addition, provinces such as Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe have also been affected by floods. Statistics show that the disaster area covers sixteen provinces, with at least fifty million disaster victims. The disaster victims either die by drowning or starvation. Those who survive are also displaced, struggling and waiting for rescue. This committee is in charge of relief affairs, and our hearts are overwhelmed with sorrow for these wailing victims. We are currently working with Shanghai gentry to raise funds for relief, but we fear that repeated calls for help will not achieve significant results. We can only implore Your Excellency to consider that this year's floods in various provinces are unprecedented in the past century, and to specifically order the Ministry of Finance to continue issuing disaster relief</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Important News Briefs</p>
<p>bonds of ten million yuan, or to allocate twenty million yuan from the recently issued national tax and salt tax treasury bonds, or to handle tobacco surcharges according to the previous proposal of this committee, to provide relief funds. We also implore that before the issuance of public bonds and treasury bonds, one to two million 現欵 be allocated first and distributed to various provinces for urgent relief, so that the disaster victims can be rescued quickly.</p>
<p>This would be in line with Your Excellency's benevolent intentions to love the people. In addition to submitting this to the Executive Yuan, I respectfully send this telegram for your instructions. Respectfully awaiting your instructions. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Affairs Committee, respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>▲ Document to the Executive Yuan: Presentation for Request: I have investigated that recently, continuous rains have persisted, and floods have caused disasters in various northern and southern provinces. This committee</p>
<p>has received urgent reports from provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu, as frequent as snowflakes. Provinces such as Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, Sichuan, Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, Ning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe have also been affected by floods. According to comprehensive statistics, the disaster area covers sixteen provinces, and although the number of disaster victims has not been reported in detail, it is estimated to be over fifty million. Taking the dead as an example, in one county, Huo Qiu in Anhui, more than eight thousand people with traceable surnames died in one day and night. Alas, our disaster victims have suddenly suffered a great catastrophe, either dying by drowning or starvation. Even those who survive are displaced, struggling and unable to survive, yet unable to die. The desolate and tragic situation is truly heartbreaking and tearful to witness. According to the elders of the villages, this year's flood is not only more severe than the flood in the tenth year of the Republic of China, but also unprecedented in the past century. The people are the foundation of the country, and food is the people's livelihood. The current situation is such that there is no hope for the autumn harvest, and the prospect is worrying. This committee is responsible for relief affairs, and we cannot shirk our responsibility. However, the funds allocated and raised have long been distributed, and little remains. Although we are working with Shanghai gentry to raise funds for relief, we fear that repeated calls for help will not achieve significant results. Such an extraordinary disaster cannot be solved with a small amount of funds, and it is even more important to provide urgent relief quickly to save the dying people. Wandering at midnight, we do not know what to do. Considering that the government has issued funds for disaster relief in Beijing and Tianjin, and all the people are rejoicing, we have no choice but to implore Your Excellency to consider that the disaster situation in various provinces is vast and the need for relief is urgent. Specifically order the Ministry of Finance to continue issuing disaster relief bonds of ten million yuan, with the funds allocated from the newly increased unified tobacco tax rate or from the Geng indemnity funds. If this cannot be done, or to handle tobacco surcharges according to the previous proposal of this committee. If this still cannot be done, one to two million yuan could be allocated from the recently issued unified tax and salt tax treasury bonds. In addition, before the public bonds or treasury bonds are issued, a special allocation of one to two million 現欵 should be made so that it can be distributed for urgent relief. This would allow the people to live and the foundation of the country to be secure. I am eagerly awaiting your instructions. All the reasons for reporting the floods in various provinces, requesting the issuance of disaster relief bonds or treasury bonds, and the prior allocation of funds for urgent relief are respectfully presented and stated. We implore your approval and prompt implementation. This would be a merciful act. Furthermore, we still hope that the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law can be implemented as soon as possible, so that we can be prepared for any eventuality. This is jointly stated.</p>
<h3>He Chengjun</h3>
<p>Reports to the National Government on the Hubei Disaster</p>
<p>▲ Requests the Relief Committee to Allocate Huge Sums for Relief</p>
<p>▲ Wuhan Announces Special Martial Law</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, considering the extraordinarily severe floods in the province, specifically reported the disaster situation to the National Government and the Executive Yuan on the 29th, requesting the Relief Committee to promptly allocate huge sums for relief. The telegram reads: I have investigated that since the beginning of summer, Hubei Province has experienced continuous rain for many days, coupled with sudden mountain floods. At the same time, the Yangtze and Han Rivers have risen, and the embankments have collapsed, causing the water to overflow and inundate the area. Even areas known for their high elevation have suffered from excessive rainfall and accumulated water, resulting in massive flooding. In addition, the season coincides with the hottest period of the year, and the rice and wheat have been submerged. The fields and livestock have all been swept away by the floods, turning the world of humans into a hellish scene, with cries of distress heard everywhere. Evil dragons and sea monsters wreak havoc, with raging waves reaching the sky. The suffering of those displaced and the tragedy of families torn apart are difficult to describe in words and are rarely seen in recent years. In recent days, we have repeatedly received reports from various places, such as Mianyang, Hanchuan, Hanyang, Huanggang, Yunmeng, Qianjiang, Xiaogan, and Jiayu counties, that the embankments have been submerged. Reports of disaster caused by continuous rain have come from counties such as Songzi, Xianning, Shishou, Yingcheng, and Qishui. Reports of mountain floods destroying fields and gardens have come from counties such as Luotian. The Yangtze River is currently overflowing, and although the heavy rain has stopped, the sky is covered with dark clouds, and we do not know how many more disaster reports will continue to come in. Even in Wuhan, such as Hualou in Hankou, the Chenjiaji area in various special districts, and the area outside Wushengmen in Nanhu, Wuchang, have all become swamps, with no end in sight. The residents are distressed, and travel is difficult. There is a danger of the cooking smoke ceasing, and every step is met with the叹息 of drowning. As for the counties that have not been flooded, they are suffering from banditry, and people are scattered in all directions. People from neighboring counties seeking refuge have no way to find food and no place to live in this disaster, and their cries of sorrow are unbearable to hear. The future consequences will be even greater. In addition to ordering the Civil Affairs Department to select capable officials to go to various districts to conduct thorough inspections, provide careful support, and supervise the Water Conservancy Bureau, Wuhan, and various counties and cities to find ways to drain the accumulated water, strictly prevent bandits from taking advantage of the situation, and convene gentry and merchants to discuss providing urgent relief, I am reporting the extraordinary severity of this year's flood in Hubei Province to Your Excellency for review and reference. I also beg that the Central Relief Committee be ordered to promptly allocate huge sums for relief and send them to Hubei for disaster relief, to extend benevolence and provide peace to the poor and suffering. I am writing this telegram with the utmost urgency and eagerness for instructions.</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters also announced special martial law on the 29th, effective immediately, due to the flooding of Wuhan streets, the clustering of citizens, and the fear of troublemakers causing disturbances. The announcement is as follows: Announcement: It has been investigated that Wuhan streets have been flooded for days, and order is quite chaotic. Troublemakers are taking advantage of the situation, endangering peace and security, which is a cause for concern and must be strictly prevented. With the approval of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, special martial law will be implemented. Traffic will be cut off at night. The streets of the three districts of Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang, as well as the outer edges of the garrison area, will be completely closed to traffic from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning. (Omission) In addition, the following temporary warning has been issued to the sentries: Do not neglect your duties due to the flooding of the streets, and be especially vigilant than usual. Shops that have been flooded should close early. This is a serious announcement. (July 30)</p>
<h3>Hankou Juxingcheng Bank Robbed</h3>
<p>▲ Banking Association Requests Protection from Authorities</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hankou Juxingcheng Bank was robbed by bandits on the 25th. The Hankou Banking Association specifically sent letters to the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Hubei Provincial Government, the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, the Hankou Municipal Government, the Hankou Third Special District Municipal Administration, and the Hankou Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting prompt measures to maintain law and order. The letter reads: Robbery in broad daylight, endangering law and order, causing panic on the streets, everyone is trembling with fear. We respectfully request that measures be taken to protect the situation to reassure merchants and maintain local peace. We respectfully report that, according to a letter from our member Juxingcheng Bank, today (July 25th) at 11:25 AM, while the bank was open for business, six bandits suddenly mixed in with the customers at the main entrance. One of them was tall with a slightly pockmarked face, speaking with a northern accent. He first snatched over two thousand yuan in banknotes from a remitter, brandished a handgun, and forbade anyone from making a sound. At the same time, the other bandits were each holding guns to intimidate people, one watching the telephone, two patrolling outside the counter, and the remaining two rushing into the counter, heading straight for the cashier's office, pointing guns at them, and then using the bags they brought to pack up over four thousand yuan in banknotes that were placed on the counter. They then leisurely left. At that time, a collector from the Banque de l'Indochine had exchanged eighty yuan in banknotes and was robbed as he was walking to the main entrance. The bandits left in succession, heading towards the Yiyuan area and disappearing. Our bank had pressed the alarm bell when it was being robbed to notify the authorities, but the police and soldiers did not arrive. It was only later discovered that the alarm bell was broken and ineffective. After the incident, we reported it to the Special Third District Administration and the Hankou Municipal Public Security Bureau by telephone, but the bandits had already disappeared. In addition to separately reporting this matter and requesting the arrest and punishment of the bandits, we are first informing the Banking Association for your information. Juxingcheng Bank is located at a wharf, close to the former Hualou, a busy transportation hub in the port area. It was midday, the weather was clear, and there was a constant flow of pedestrians and many patrolling soldiers and police. The bandits dared to commit a robbery with guns in broad daylight, acting calmly and unhurriedly, showing no fear in their hearts, treating the soldiers and police as if they were nothing, and disrupting the law and order of the city. If this trend continues, the consequences will be unimaginable. The damage to Juxingcheng Bank may seem like an isolated incident, but there are numerous banks and shops in Hankou, and similar dangers could occur anywhere and at any time. Moreover, banks handle cash and banknotes, with amounts often reaching tens of thousands of yuan, which is common. Customers make payments and receipts, and there is no fixed schedule. In this atmosphere of terror, we do not know where to find protection. All the banks in our association were deeply surprised to hear the news of the robbery of Juxingcheng Bank in broad daylight. We have jointly discussed and believe that everyone is in danger, and the situation on the streets is unpredictable. If we do not take measures to protect the situation, we will not be able to reassure merchants and maintain local peace. In addition to the bank reporting the matter and requesting the arrest and punishment of the bandits, which should be done by the bank, the incident is so strange that we cannot remain silent. We must detail the dangerous situation and respectfully inform Your Excellency of the situation. We beg that Your Bureau investigate and promptly take measures to maintain law and order, so that such robberies can be eliminated from now on, and the city's businesses can be safe. We also ask for your instructions to be followed. With utmost urgency and eagerness for instructions, we respectfully present this to the Hankou Banking Association, July 25th, 20th year [of the Republic].</p>
<h3>Wu Peifu Travels to Chengdu via Shunqing</h3>
<p>▲ Wu gives moral lectures everywhere</p>
<p>▲ Li Qixiang Provides Travel Expenses of Ten Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Shunqing Correspondence: Wu Peifu arrived in Shunqing from Suilai a few days ago, on June 25th. He stayed for eight days before proceeding to the provincial capital. During his stay in Shunqing, he had earnest conversations with Li Qixiang. The following is a record of his passage through Shunqing and his journey to the provincial capital:</p>
<p>Wu arrived in Shunqing on June 25th, and that evening Li Qixiang hosted a lavish banquet to welcome Wu. On the 26th, the Border Defense Army also arranged a theatrical performance at a theater to welcome him. On the 27th, Xiong Yuzhang of the 23rd Division invited Wu to a feast at Ganlu Temple. Wu's son was always by his side, accompanying him whether he was sightseeing or attending banquets. On the 28th, Wu had some free time, but there were too many visitors to the 行辕, making it difficult to meet them all individually. He specifically invited representatives from various Shunqing government agencies, legal entities, and gentry to attend a lecture at the Guoshan Theater. After the crowd gathered, Wu, wearing an old-fashioned army cap, a long gown, and a black waistcoat, ascended the stage. After a few words of self-deprecation, he spoke about filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, emphasizing the two characters of morality to encourage everyone. After the speech, he distributed copies of his book "Following One's Duty," with an attached letter, to each person. After distributing the books, he repeated his exhortations several times before everyone dispersed. On the 29th, leaders from the Nanchong County Bureau and local government agencies and legal entities hosted a banquet for Wu at the Guoshan Theater. Wu, his son, Li Qixiang, Xiong Yuzhang, Wang Boyuan, He Zhanru, Liu Hanxiong, Li Qingting, Ye Jishi, Yang Duanwu, Fan Yingshi, Chen Shaotang, Zhang Ximin, and about one hundred other senior military officers attended. Wu, wearing casual clothes and a hat, sat alone in the center seat, with his son below him and only Li Qixiang and Xiong Yuzhang accompanying him on both sides. The other personnel were seated on the left and right sides. The tables were surrounded by Wu's guards, all holding knives, guns, and grenades, numbering about three hundred people, standing and waiting, with no one daring to sit down without permission. After the performance began, the first play was "Chang'e Flying to the Moon," and Wu rewarded it with one hundred yuan. Li Qixiang requested "Battle of Yongzhou" and rewarded it with fifty yuan. Xiong Yuzhang requested "Gathering of Heroes" and rewarded it with forty yuan. Other brigade commanders requested many plays, and the banquet did not end until after midnight. On the 30th, Wu, about to leave Shunqing, hosted a banquet for leaders from various Nanchong government agencies and legal entities at the Shunqing Guoshan Theater as a farewell memento. Around 4:00 PM, the guests arrived one after another. Before the performance began, Wu gave a brief speech, first expressing his gratitude to everyone, and then talking about how the world and people's hearts are too corrupt in modern times, and that it is impossible to govern the world without restoring people's hearts. To restore people's hearts, we must emphasize morality, promote propriety and righteousness, and teach the people filial piety and brotherly love. Someone in the audience asked about military and political affairs, but Wu immediately declined, refusing to discuss them. Wu originally planned to leave Shunqing and head west on July 1st, but postponed his departure until the 3rd because there were still matters to be arranged in Shunqing. However, on the evening before his departure (2nd), he went to the Border Defense Army Headquarters to bid farewell to Li Qixiang. Li Qixiang prepared a farewell banquet, and there was a lingering reluctance during the banquet. After the banquet, Li ordered someone to deliver ten thousand yuan as travel expenses to strengthen his journey. After Wu received it, he sent an aide-de-camp to Li's headquarters to express his gratitude. Xiong Yuzhang, the acting commander of the 23rd Division, also went to Wu's 行辕 on the evening of the 2nd to bid him farewell, and presented him with one thousand yuan in 現欵 and various local products from Nanchong. Wu accepted everything. On the morning of the 3rd, after 5:00 AM, the Border Defense Army and the 23rd Division prepared fifty pack animals and two hundred and fifty porters for Wu, all gathered at Wu's 行辕. After the luggage was loaded, they set off. The whole city was covered with flags, and there were many people at the train station outside the Sanjiao Temple to see him off. Wu, wearing a blue silk robe, a black gauze waistcoat, and a soft felt hat, traveled to the station by car with his wife, Mrs. Zhang, and his son, and then changed to a sedan chair because the road to Tongchuan had not yet been built. Wang Hongen, who had served as a brigade commander in the Northwest Army and had been stationed in Guangyuan for a long time, also traveled with Wu. Li Qixiang, Xiong Yuzhang, He Zhanru, Liu Hanxiong, Fan Yingshi, Pang Yuqing, and Long Huanzhang, as well as the heads of local agencies and the Nanchong County Bureau, all went outside the city to see him off. There were about three hundred pistol-wielding soldiers escorting the luggage ahead, Wu and his wife led their son and Wang Hongen, as well as Wu's senior officers, about seventy people in total, and fifty bodyguards, followed. The grenade team and the remaining four or five hundred officers marched at the rear. As he was about to depart, Wu took off his hat and nodded goodbye to Li Qixiang and the other well-wishers.</p>
<p>Since Wu's arrival in Shunqing, there has been a banquet every day, and visitors have been thronging the streets, almost leaving him no free time. Moreover, Wu, as a Grand Marshal, was accompanied by hundreds of people for every move he made. When he walked, the streets were blocked, and when he stayed, the houses were full. The grenade team and the bodyguards, numbering about seventy or eighty people, closely followed him at all times. During banquets, the streets he passed through were extensively guarded in advance, and pedestrians were prohibited from passing. Then, he would travel by car. The same was true when he returned to the 行辕 after the banquet. Therefore, after Wu stayed in Shunqing for several days, the military and political authorities and local people began to feel a little annoyed. When Wu was scheduled to go to the provincial capital, the Border Defense Headquarters specially prepared three hundred catties of pork, ten jars of fine wine, and one thousand silver dollars to reward Wu's entourage. All of this shows the friendship between Li Qixiang and Wu.</p>
<h3>Report from the Korean Consulate General's Office on the Incheon Riot</h3>
<p>Report: I have investigated that the cause of this Korean riot was the Korean Daily News' propaganda about the Wanbaoshan Incident, issuing a special edition (which has been reported to the Consulate General), fabricating facts. It began at 2:00 AM on the 3rd of this month. While Wenhe was sound asleep, he was suddenly awakened by a servant, who claimed that someone had urgently reported that dozens of Koreans were throwing stones at Chinese food shops, barbershops, and restaurants in the outer district of Incheon, breaking many windows and light bulbs. He requested that the police station be notified by telephone for protection. Because the matter involved violence, Wenhe immediately got out of bed. In addition to notifying the police station to send police officers quickly, he went by car to investigate because it was raining heavily and the road was far. He confirmed that the Qingyuntang barbershop and Yongdelou restaurant were indeed damaged in the outer district. He immediately returned to the office. By dawn, rumors of a Korean riot were spreading, and僑民 were flocking to Chinatown to seek refuge. Fearing a major disaster, Wenhe rushed to the police station around 8:00 AM and met with Director Dongchuan, asking him to prohibit the newspaper from spreading its exaggerated stories and to take steps to prevent a repeat of the tragedy of 1927. After returning to the office, he also called Consul General Zhang to ask the Governor-General to order police stations in various places to provide effective protection until 6:00 PM. Koreans gathered in large numbers at the railway bridge in the outer district to give speeches. Upon hearing the news, Wenhe immediately called the police station to stop them and accompanied Chairman Chuan of the Chamber of Commerce and Director Dongchuan to inspect the area. Seeing that the Koreans on the street were gradually dispersing, he felt quite relieved. Unexpectedly, around 8:00 PM, Koreans gathered again, numbering over three thousand, and launched a large-scale riot. The whole city was in chaos. Chinese men and women fled, and the doors and windows of Chinese businesses were smashed. The police could not stop them. Wenhe accompanied Chairman Chuan of the Chamber of Commerce to the police station to request armed action to suppress the riot. The director refused to send troops because he had not received orders from the Provincial Office. The rioters then formed a group and attacked Chinatown. Fortunately, our僑民 defended together and prevented them from entering. The rioters retreated and threw stones at Chinese shops along the way, looting and discarding goods. Many僑民 were injured that night, but no one was killed. The larger shops of Chinese merchants in the inner and outer districts did not suffer significant losses. By dawn, the rioters had dispersed somewhat, but there were rumors that the Koreans would attack Chinatown on the evening of the 4th, and some Koreans who were friendly with Chinese also called to advise them to take temporary shelter to avoid danger. As a result, everyone was frightened and at a loss, and they came to the office to report the situation. Wenhe urgently reported the situation to Consul General Zhang by telephone, requesting the Governor-General to send additional armed police to Incheon for protection. At the same time, he rushed to the police station to question the director, stating that since he had declared that he was responsible for protection, why could he not stop the rioters? Did he have the ability to provide protection? He asked for a clear answer so that he could plan accordingly. The director replied that there were not many police officers here and that there might be inadequate protection outside the government office. However, the Koreans were only throwing stones and beating people, and there would be no major incidents. He hoped that the Chinese would not resist, so as not to make it impossible to maintain order. He would take full responsibility for the lives and property of the Chinese. At 4:00 PM, Consul Zhang Mao came to Incheon and addressed the僑民, saying that the Governor-General had agreed to send additional police officers and asked everyone to be at ease. Later, he accompanied Wenhe to the police station to meet with the director and asked him if he was confident in maintaining law and order. The director still said that he was fully responsible. Before leaving, Consul General Zhang told the director that the lives and property of the four thousand Chinese侨民 in Incheon were all in his hands. He replied that he was fully responsible. Around 9:00 PM, it was reported that the Koreans had gathered again in the outer district, beating drums and gathering a crowd of about five thousand people, and had begun to riot, wielding wooden sticks, iron bars, knives, and axes, searching and attacking everywhere. All the Chinese shops in the inner and outer districts were broken open by the rioters using freight cars, and the telephone and electric wires were cut with knives and axes. Goods were looted and discarded, and the streets were in a terrible state. Finally, cloth and silk were hung on trees or wrapped around telephone poles and wires. The Koreans rioted in front, and the police followed behind, completely losing the ability to protect. The whole city was in a state of panic, like a battlefield. Calls for help from各僑用 telephone poured in. At that time, the Chinese侨民 in Incheon were in danger of being completely wiped out. Upon receiving the report, we immediately telegraphed Consul General Zhang, asking him to negotiate with the Governor-General and send a large number of soldiers and police to Incheon for assistance. At the same time, we telegraphed the Incheon police station, asking them to provide effective protection for the lives and property of all the Chinese僑民. Around 3:00 AM on the 5th, seventeen armed police officers and gendarmes from the capital arrived. The police were also armed. Seeing the situation was not good, they fired two shots into the air, and the rioters retreated. They did not enter Chinatown because of the heavy police presence, so Chinatown was spared. In the early morning, the僑民 widely rumored that many people had been killed by the Koreans in the outer district and in the Zhuan area outside the government office. Wenhe accompanied Chairman Chuan of the Chamber of Commerce to search for them and inspect the devastation in the inner and outer districts. He took photos on the spot as evidence. He also went to the Changyili mountain stone ranch near Zhuan and found that Lian Kuishan and Li Houji from the outer district had been beaten to death, a total of two people. There were also two people still alive, Lu Huanxin and Wang Youzhi, who were hired by a car to send to the Muze Surgical Hospital, hoping to avoid death, but according to the doctor, they may be disabled. They are currently still in the hospital. A cargo truck was urgently hired to transport僑民 from far and near to Chinatown for refuge, a total of 1,500 people. The two deceased were dissected by Wenhe together with Di, an inspector (prosecutor) from the Incheon branch of the 京城检事局, at the Incheon Quarantine Station, and then buried by the Chamber of Commerce. There were also more than twenty people with minor injuries. On the morning of the 5th, about four thousand rioters gathered around Chinatown, attempting to attack in front of the Incheon Government Office, which was less than half a mile from Chinatown. Fortunately, the police dispersed them with cavalry. In the outer district, they set fire to one place. The 本办事处, the Chamber of Commerce, and the school had sheltered about 3,600 refugees in the past three days. Things have gradually calmed down since the 6th, but the侨民 are all like frightened birds. Therefore, from the 6th to yesterday, more than 8,000 people have taken the Chinese 利通号轮船 and the Japanese 共同丸 from Incheon to return to China. Currently, about two hundred people are still taking refuge in the Chinese primary school, etc. Later, Consul General Zhang came to Incheon to express his condolences and investigate.</p>
<p>According to investigations, the direct losses in Incheon alone are about 90,000 日金. The indirect losses are currently being investigated in detail. I have collected the details of this riot in Incheon. I hope that you will consider it. Chiang Wenhe, Director of the Incheon Office of the Consulate General of the Republic of China in Korea, July 20.</p>

On the afternoon of May 28th of this year, Cheng Wengan's body was suddenly found on the riverbank of Tan渡 Bridge. Prosecutor Zhu of the County Court, accompanied by a coroner, went to examine the body and confirmed that he had died by falling into the river. However, the deceased's elder brothers, Wenpei and Wenhan, refused to accept this and went to Ding Ruqing's house, dragging Ding to the Public Security Bureau, claiming that Wengan did not die by falling into the river but was beaten to death by Ding Ruqing and thrown into the river because his wife, Gendi, was unfaithful. Ding Ruqing denied this and was transferred to the County Court for questioning. However, each party maintained their previous statements. Ding Ruqing, his wife Xiao, and daughter Gendi have been detained until now without a resolution. The Cheng Wenpei brothers expressed distrust of Prosecutor Zhu's examination and entrusted a lawyer to appeal to the High Court Prosecutor's Office, which approved a re-examination of the body.

<p>Large Number of Vagrants Escape from the Reformatory: The Wuyi Vagrant Reformatory, which houses about ninety-seven vagrants, who usually do weaving and other crafts, closed the main gate of the vagrant residences at 8:00 PM on the 30th. Suddenly, a noise was heard inside the gate. After the patrol chief opened the lock and tried to enter to mediate, the vagrants, armed with tile bowls and wooden sticks, rushed forward and beat the patrol chief and patrolmen. They then rushed out to the north. The gate guards were unable to stop them. The incident was reported to the Public Security Bureau for assistance in the pursuit. Those who escaped were chased back, but after a headcount, it was found that thirty-two vagrants, including Yuan Bingquan, had escaped. Director Zhao Yonghuai reported to the county government, which immediately closed the city to search. Only four or five people had been captured by late at night.

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Thorough Investigation of the Body Dumping Case of the "Dahe" Ship: The "Dahe" ship of the Dada Company's Shanghai-Yangzhou line unloaded an injured corpse at Tianshenggang and then took it upstream. After someone reported it, the corpse was allegedly dumped into the river. The county government, believing that Tang Ruiquan, the director of the port Public Security Bureau, had unclear procedures and was suspected of accepting bribes, has dismissed him from his post pending a thorough investigation by the court. The High Court has designated the Zhenjiang District Court to handle the case. The entire file has been sent to Zhenjiang. The Nantong County Court has received a letter from the Zhenjiang District Court, forwarding it to the Public Security Bureau, stating that since the Dada Company claimed that the corpse was taken away by the corpse's nephew, Li Yifu, they should indicate the burial address so that personnel can be sent to verify the truth.</p>
<p>Methods for Raising Bank Protection Funds: The collapse of the riverbank in Nantong is becoming more severe. The local financial resources for handling bank protection projects are limited. Appeals have been made to the province. The provincial government has approved the allocation of funds to subsidize the project from the income from the increased tax on reed fields, and has approved the bank protection association's request to collect an additional 3.5% tax per mu on land tax for bank protection. The total cost of the fundamental project is estimated at 300,000 yuan. The shortfall will be covered by issuing local public bonds.</p>
<p>Severe Flooding in the Surrounding Villages: Severe flooding has occurred in Tongyi.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>All Shops Prohibited from Transporting Japanese Goods Anymore: The Provincial Propaganda Committee has recently learned that Zhenjiang merchants are actively transporting Japanese goods amidst the anti-Japanese movement, seeking profit from the opportunity.

Yesterday, the committee sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, stipulating that all shops in Zhenjiang must not transport Japanese goods after August 1st.

<p>Ye Chucang's Second Son Drowns While Swimming in the River: Yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM, the second son of Chairman Ye of the Provincial Government first played basketball at the public playground of the Civil Affairs Department.

All four entered the water at the same time. After a while, the Civil Affairs Department clerk and the eldest son of Hu could not see Chairman Ye's second son and the Wang clerk in the water and knew that they had drowned. The Provincial Government immediately reported to the government and sent laborers to salvage the bodies. The two were hooked up and retrieved.

<p>Xuejia Kiln Township Chief Brutally Murdered by Bandits: Xue Hanqing, the township chief of Xuejia Kiln Township in the Zhentao District of Rugao, went to Zhujiabu on business at 8:00 PM on the 27th. On his way home, when he reached the west end of Xuejia Kiln, suddenly many Red Bandits came face to face, holding guns. When the township chief saw this situation, he jumped into the river to escape. However, the bandits also went into the water with guns and chased him, causing Township Chief Xue to be brutally shot. When the local people heard the news, they flew to report to the county police and the Security Corps stationed in the area to track down and suppress the bandits, but they had already disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Bandits Active in Caolan Embankment: In the Caolan Embankment area of Zhentao Township in this county, more than 20 bandits suddenly came on the night of the 27th, holding guns, intending to kill the township chief and deputy of the area. Fortunately, they did not encounter them. The bandits turned back halfway and encountered Wang Mao, a notorious bandit from the area who had surrendered, who was captured and shot. It is reported that the bandits who came to the embankment this time were led by Yu Xian, a notorious bandit from Fenghuo Port, who came here to operate.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Grain Boat Robbed at Huajiatan: Wu Guozong, a grain merchant from Jiangba Town in Xuyi County, loaded a boat of miscellaneous grains in that area a few days ago and came to Gaoyou to sell it. However, yesterday morning (the 26th), when he arrived at the Huajiatan area, he suddenly encountered a boat. Four bandits jumped out, each holding a gun, and ordered the boat to stop. They jumped onto Wu's boat and searched extensively, robbing a self-defense gun and more than 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Sudden Increase in River Water and All Alarmed to Secure the Dyke: In this county yesterday at about 4:00 PM, a sudden light rain fell and a southwest wind rose, causing the water level of the canal to suddenly rise from 1.7 zhang to 1.78 zhang. The west dyke was completely submerged by water. Residents living on the west dyke moved to the east dyke. The lake and river were connected and indistinguishable, a vast expanse of water. At 9:00 PM, a low dyke at the Jieganting section outside the South Gate suddenly overflowed, which was extremely dangerous. The alarm was immediately sounded to secure the dyke and raise the height of the dyke body. Fortunately, there was no problem. The authorities in this county, because the water level was increasing and there was a danger of the dyke breaking, hired workers overnight to block the Touzhakou and the river mouths along the river, preparing to open the dams for drainage. However, more than 1,000 farmers in Xinghua, seeing that Gaoyou intended to open the dams, became very panicked. They gathered at the Touzhakou and river mouths, refusing to allow them to be blocked. There has been no result yet. Fortunately, the sky has cleared today and the southwest wind has stopped, and the water has receded to 1.75 zhang. It is hoped that there will be no more strong winds and rain, so that each dam can be preserved until it is opened after autumn.</p>
<h3>Xinghua</h3>
<p>Xinghua Legal Organizations Petition to Protect the Dams: Representatives of various legal organizations in Xinghua, Ruan Zhongmei and Ruan Yicheng, presented a petition to the Provincial Government, the Ministry of Interior, and the Huai River Guidance Association, stating that they had lived in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, for generations and knew the water conditions of the upper and lower rivers. In years of severe flooding, the five dams in Gaoyou County that return to the sea are never lightly opened until after the beginning of autumn. There are precedents to follow for decades. A telegram was received from the Xinghua County Legal Organizations stating that the old practice of opening the dams is after autumn, and before autumn there will be no harvest, and they urgently await the calls of various key officials for help, to protect as much as possible, etc. The five dams are named as returning to the sea, but in fact they are far from the sea. The water flowing down from the dams is no different from harming the neighbor. Now, with continuous rain causing disaster, spreading across several provinces, and various counties in Jiangbei also suffering, if one of the five dams returning to the sea is opened again before autumn, then parts of Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Shiying, and Huai'an counties, as well as all of Xinghua, Taixian, Dongtai, Yancheng, and Funing counties, will become swamps wherever the floods flow, causing hundreds of thousands of acres of crops to be lost and millions of disaster victims to have no way to survive. The impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is so great. For this reason, it is requested that your Excellency telegraph the Canal Engineering Office to ensure that the dams in Gaoyou County that return to the sea are protected as much as possible, even if the water level increases without decreasing, and to extend the time in accordance with the precedents before opening the dams in the 5th and 10th years of the Republic of China, and handle them accordingly. If the weather is clear and the wind is right, and they are fully protected, it will be even more perfect.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>The Liu-Sheng Divorce Case Has Been Pronounced: Liu Yanting, a wealthy man from Nanxun Town in Huzhou, was sued last year by his wife, Liu Sheng (daughter of the late Sheng Xingsheng), to the Wuxing Local Branch Court, requesting a divorce from her husband, Liu Yanting, due to certain reasons, and demanding that the defendant, Liu Yanting, pay the plaintiff over 800,000 yuan in alimony. The court investigated and debated the case several times, and finally granted the divorce. The judgment was pronounced yesterday. The main text of the judgment is recorded below: The marriage between Liu Sheng and the defendant, Liu Yanting, is granted a divorce. Liu Yanting shall pay Liu Sheng 52,200 yuan in alimony after the divorce and 10,000 yuan in dowry. The plaintiff's remaining claims are rejected. The litigation costs of the first instance shall be borne by the plaintiff, Liu Sheng, for eight-tenths and by the defendant, Liu Yanting, for two-tenths.</p>
<p>Pishan Flood Disaster Request to Ban Slaughter: In the Pishan Village area outside the North Gate of this city, there are a total of thirteen agricultural dikes. Due to continuous rain, the villagers have been sounding gongs day and night to gather the masses to monitor the dikes. However, the dikes are only a few inches away from the river water. Therefore, more than 100 farmers gathered with Village Chief Shen of the village and came to the Wuxing County Government in the city at around 1:00 PM today, the 29th, to report the flood disaster and request that the County Magistrate issue an order to ban slaughter.</p>

On both sides, there are tables comparing the categories of occupations, a list of new experimental careers of the Vocational Education Society, and a comparison table of secondary vocational education in China and Japan, with a long couplet: The first line says, "Confucius did not say that if you want to establish yourself, you should establish others; if you want to achieve yourself, you should achieve others, this can be called the way of benevolence." The second line says, "We think this way to make the unemployed employed, to make the employed enjoy their work, what else is there to ask", the language is timeless and easy to understand</p>

<h3>County Party Headquarters Requests Repayment of Education Funds Owed by the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>▲ From July of the 17th year to June of the 20th year</p>
<p>▲ A huge debt of 36,000 yuan</p>
<p>Since the separation of Shanghai County from the municipality, all county-level education funds, after consultation between the province and the city, were to be subsidized by the municipal government at 1,000 yuan per month. However, the municipal government violated the agreement and failed to issue the funds, accumulating a debt of 36,000 yuan from July of the 17th year to the end of June of the 20th year. Yesterday, the county executive committee submitted a request to the provincial reorganization committee, asking the provincial government to forward it to the Shanghai municipal government, urging compliance with the agreement and repayment of the owed subsidies. The original request is as follows: The request concerns the Shanghai municipal government violating the municipal agreement by failing to issue subsidies for county-level education funds. It is requested to forward the letter to the provincial government and then to the national government to implement the agreement and allocate the subsidy funds to maintain education. Upon investigation, Article 5, Section E of the resolutions of the conference on the division of administrative power between the province and the city stipulates that the municipal government will subsidize Shanghai County's education funds by 1,000 yuan per month. This agreement was made because the county's annual revenue has decreased since the separation from the municipal government to compensate it, which should be honored by both parties to ensure fairness. However, the municipal government has not complied with the agreement and has failed to issue the subsidies for county-level education funds. It is estimated that the subsidy has been in arrears, calculated from July of the 17th year to the end of June of the 20th year, totaling 36,000 yuan. This not only hinders the development of county education, but also because both the province and the city are under the National Government, the agreement reached should naturally have absolute legal effect. Therefore, the county's third full congress of representatives resolved to recover the educational subsidy owed to it by the Shanghai Municipal Government. We hereby request your commission to forward this to the provincial government, and then to the Shanghai Municipal Government, to implement the provincial-municipal agreement, to clear the previously owed education subsidy, and to provide subsidies on schedule according to the agreement in the future, so as to respect the agreement and maintain education.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Holds Elementary School Teacher Registration</h3>

In addition to all necessary sanitary facilities, it has everything it should have. It also ordered two generators from Germany to supply electricity to the entire school and drilled an artesian well, using a motor to pump water to supply water. In terms of curriculum, the heads of various departments have also jointly revised and reorganized it to strive for perfection.

<h3>China Association Lost in the Class A Tennis League of the Central Ground Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Lost to South Grassland Six to Nine</p>
<p>▲ Qiu Jiang's Complete Victory Was to No Avail</p>
<p>—China Association Will Battle West Youth Tomorrow—</p>
<p>The China Tennis Association played a makeup game of the Class A Grass Court Tennis League against South Grassland at the China Tennis Court yesterday afternoon. A large crowd watched. As a result, the China Association lost to South Grassland by a score of six to nine. However, the first group of the China Association, Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang, won against the South Grassland stars Huite group. Huite's poor pairings were ineffective. Qiu Feihai received the most praise, and Jiang's performance was more satisfactory than usual, with powerful shots. Unfortunately, the second and fifth groups were completely defeated, greatly hurting the China Association's morale. In addition to Qiu Jiang's three points, Yu Liu scored one point, and Qian Tu scored two points, totaling six points. South Grassland's victory lies in its average talent. The team had previously won against the French Chamber of Commerce by a score of eight to seven and against North Grassland by a score of eleven to four, which is not a bad record. The China Association is scheduled to play a makeup game against West Youth at the China Tennis Court at 5:00 PM tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Hsien Fang Cup Tennis League</h3>
<p>▲ Five groups will begin competing at 3:00 PM today</p>
<p>Due to continuous rain over the past half-month, various tennis matches in this city have been greatly affected. The "Hsien Fang Cup," which was widely promoted for a time, was originally scheduled to open last Saturday, but was postponed due to heavy rain. It has now been announced that it will open today. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Railway vs. Wenyi Wenyi Tennis Court</p>
<p>Feipeng vs. Yukuai Yukuai Tennis Court</p>
<p>Qingbai vs. Shuguang Shuguang Tennis Court</p>
<p>Meilu vs. Youyou Youyou Tennis Court</p>
<p>Ludeng vs. China China Tennis Court</p>
<p>The games for each group will begin at 3:00 PM. The association also announced that Guo Yu-chieh is permitted to represent the Youyou team, and Yu Jie is permitted to substitute for the Ludeng team. This is because Guo Qida and Guo Pengnian have withdrawn, leaving the team short of players, so Yu is entering. It is also noted that the Qingbai team's court is located at Datia University on Zhongshan Road, Fanwangdu. The various teams are requested to pay attention, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sheng Pinchen Announces the Launch of the East China Team, Aiming to Promote Sports and Develop National Glory in Football</h3>
<p>—One of the talks at last night's social banquet</p>
<p>▲ Lineup is set—May need to be changed in the future</p>
<p>Since the strength of the Yuehua Football Team declined and its star players scattered, the Shanghai football scene has become depressed. Suddenly, there is good news. Sheng Pinchen, Shen Yiqing, Sheng Ping, Xu Zhendong, Huang Dazhong, Zhou Jiaqi, Dai Linshu, Dai Linzhao, Wei Chengrui, and 24 others have launched the East China Football Club.</p>
<h3>Last Night's Social Banquet of the East China Association ○ Committee Chairman Mr. Sheng Pinchen (Photo by this Newspaper)</h3>
<p>Almost all football talents with special skills in the East China region have been recruited. Even Chen Guangyao and Cao Guicheng from Hong Kong, and Sun Sijing from Tianjin, have heard the news and come to join. Judging by its strength, at least to the minimum extent, it is sure to surpass Yuehua. At 8:00 PM last night, the association invited members of the sports and journalism communities to hold a social gathering at the New World Restaurant. More than thirty people attended. Halfway through the dinner, Sheng Pinchen, the founder and chairman of the association, stood up and announced the association's founding purpose, which is to "promote sports" and "develop national glory." In other words, they hope to achieve a superior position in the Chinese and Western football community in Shanghai, in order to enhance international reputation. Also, in this era of Yuehua's decline, there is a need for an organized sports institution to step forward and shoulder this important task. The founders earnestly hope for the support of comrades in the sports and journalism communities. Committee member Xu Zhendong said that the association pays close attention to the amateur status of the players, and the association's affairs and finances are all public. In short, the founders and players of the association all embrace a clean and honest spirit, with no meaning of false borrowing or exploitation included in it. This will be proven when the constitution is published in the future. Finally, Sun Daosheng gave a reply on behalf of the guests, saying that the development of various sports in Europe and the United States is half due to the widespread establishment of sports organizations. In recent years, there have also been gentlemen and merchants in our country who are enthusiastic about sports and have resolutely organized themselves, such as Cheng Yize of the Youyou Sports Association, which has achieved success, and Sheng Pinchen of the East China Association, which announced its founding purpose today. They are truly pioneers in the development of Chinese sports. In addition to expressing our sympathy, we should also provide them with considerable assistance in practice, and move towards a bright future together. We not only hope for their development. According to Chen Yutian of the association, the team roster is roughly as follows, but there may be changes in the future. For example, there is talk that Chen Zhenhe may join the aviation industry. Whether he will come or not will be determined at a later date, so it cannot be regarded as the official lineup.</p>
<p>Let's observe the lineup.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Takeover of the French Concession Court</h3>
<p>▲ The Two Presidents Are Scheduled to Take Office at the Court Today</p>
<p>▲ The French Consul General Expresses Great Satisfaction</p>
<p>The reorganization of the French Concession Court into the Third Branch of the High Court and the Second Branch of the Special District Local Court is scheduled to formally establish today. Yesterday, Liang Renjie, the President of the High Court, and Ying Shi, the President of the Special Court, went to take over the French Concession Court and the prison. All personnel of the two courts will report to the court today. The situation yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Turnover Personnel: The personnel who participated in the takeover and handover yesterday included Yang Zhaoyun, the representative of the Judicial Administration Department, Secretary Xiao Jinfang, the newly appointed President of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court Liang Renjie, Chief Prosecutor Peng Wangye, the President of the Second Branch of the Shanghai Special District Local Court Ying Shi, Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan, Warden Xie Fuzi, and others from the Chinese side. The French side included French Consul General Gamgerlin, former French Concession Court Assessor Tu Ge, Assessor Jia Dang, French Public Works Bureau Acting Director General Jia Si, former French Concession Court Warden Gu Sai, and other staff members.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Between the Two Parties: At about 6:00 PM yesterday,</p>
<p>Liang, Ying, Peng, Chen and other officials from the two courts, as well as the President of the Special District Court Yang Zhaoyun and National Government Secretary Xiao Jinfang, led the takeover staff to the French Concession Court. French Consul General Gamgerlin and French Concession Court Assessor Tu Ge came out to meet them. Consul General Gan soon left. Tu Ge led Liang, Ying, and others to various places inside the court to inspect the document delivery room, the Chinese Civil Division, the Chinese Criminal Division, the Chinese and Foreign Civil Division, the Chinese and Foreign Criminal Division, the Civil and Criminal Division without Consular Jurisdiction, the Prosecutor's Office, and other places. Tu Ge also gave detailed instructions and explanations. ▲ Takeover Situation: During the takeover, Xiao Jinfang allocated the personnel taking over the French Concession Court. The takeover was divided into several parts, including the takeover of funds, the takeover of buildings, and the takeover of miscellaneous items. The takeover was carried out by clerks and translators from the Special Court. After all the documents and files of the French Concession Court were transferred to the Chinese court, it became the new court's office. Therefore, all the handover procedures were carried out there. However, because it was already late at 6:00 PM and there were many</p>
<h3>Chinese and French Personnel Taking Over the French Concession Court. (Photo by this newspaper)</h3>
<p>items, it was not easy to take over everything at once. Therefore, President Liang and others decided to completely transfer all items from the French Concession Court to the new court and check them again this morning. For the night, they sent clerk Pan Shou-hien and translator Yang Lan-chun to take responsibility for safekeeping.</p>
<p>▲ Takeover of the Prison: The prison of the French Concession Court was also taken over by our side. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, President Liang and President Ying took a car to inspect the French prison on Route Massenet and Rue Sévère. At 6:00 PM, Warden Xie Fuzi led more than sixty prison guards to take over the prison. President Liang and others also went to discuss the takeover situation with the French Warden Gouget. In the prison, Chinese police were sent to guard all the posts that were originally guarded by French prison guards. The number of police was the same as the original number of French prison guards. After Chinese police had been stationed at all the French posts, the French police withdrew completely. At this point, the takeover of the prison was completed. This was like a shift change.</p>
<p>▲ Remarks by the French Consul: After meeting President Liang and others, French Consul General Gamgerlin made remarks, saying that he was deeply satisfied to transfer the French Concession Court to China according to the wishes of the French side. In the future, if the Chinese side encounters any difficulties with the French Concession Court, he will do his best to help or offer suggestions to the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>▲ Remarks by Mr. Liang: President Liang also spoke in French to the French Assessor Tu Ge, saying that this takeover was not only fortunate for China, but also fortunate for France. This is enough to enhance the friendship between China and France and connect the feelings between the two countries. The French Concession Court has achieved excellent results so far. We deeply appreciate the spirit of the French side acting as an agent for China, and at the same time, we hope that Mr. Tu Ge will give us some advice. Mr. Tu Ge is willing to serve as an advisor to the new court (there were provisions for the position of advisor in the agreement). This point may become a reality.</p>
<p>▲ Taking Office Today: This morning at 9:00 AM, President Liang, President Ying, and others will go to the new court to take office. Because they rushed to complete the handover procedures last night, the time was too short, and various trivial matters were not cleared up. Therefore, today the two presidents will supervise the staff to handle the unfinished matters after the handover. Most of the cases in the court have been suspended, but important and urgent cases will still be heard as usual.</p>
<p>▲ Atmosphere of the New Location: The offices of the two courts, the High Court is located at Heng'ai Lane on Rue Victor Heushem and the Special Court is located at He Meifang on Rue Sévère (i.e., behind the French Concession Court). Last night, people were already moving all the wooden furniture and equipment into the new locations and hanging up brand-new white-bottomed black-lettered signs. The buildings were also thoroughly renovated, looking brand new and adding a vibrant atmosphere. From now on, the judicial organs of the three worlds in this city will be under the central judicial rule, and the name of the French Concession Court will become a historical past.</p>
<p>▲ French Lawyers: After the reorganization of the French Concession Court, the French Public Works Bureau specially appointed lawyers Fei Xizhen and Gu Shouxi as the legal representatives of the French police. Lawyers Fei and Gu have already accepted formal letters of appointment and will start working immediately.</p>
<p>▲ French Consul Presents Medals: Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, French Consul General Gamgerlin and Deputy Assessor Tu Ge, Jia Dang, Chinese Assessors Zhu Qi, Gong Xiang, Tang Zaili, and the entire Chinese and Western staff of the prosecutor's office gathered at the French Concession Court. First, French Consul General Gamgerlin gave a speech to all the Chinese and Western staff. Then, he awarded the medals issued by the French government to Vidal, the head of the prosecutor's office, and Zhu Taizeng, the former clerk of the prosecutor's office, and Wang Yintao and Lu Hairong, the clerks in charge of distribution, for their diligence and commendable work. Consul General Gan personally pinned the medals on the chests of the four men as a reward.</p>
<h3>Temporary Alert Today</h3>
<p>▲ Precautions by the Chinese Concession Authorities</p>
<p>Today is the so-called "August 1st" Red Memorial Day. At a time when the suppression of the Communists and the rebellion is urgent, the military and police authorities in the Chinese concession of this city have temporarily announced an alert for the sake of maintaining peace in the rear. Garrison troops in all parts of the North and South City have been increased to send out patrol teams, and armed soldiers have been stationed at all important passes on the border between the Chinese and foreign concessions. The district teams under the Municipal Public Security Bureau have also increased the number of police on duty, paying attention to the passers-by and inspecting them as the situation dictates. Patrol teams have been increased to patrol the streets. The water patrol team of the Huangpu River has also stepped up its defenses. The concessions have also been stricter than usual.</p>
<h3>Ma Fuxiang Talks About the Suppression of Shi Yousan</h3>
<p>▲ The Isolated Troops of Shi Can Be Expected to Be Annihilated</p>
<p>▲ The Northeastern Air Raids Are Effective and Even Faster</p>
<p>Ma Fuxiang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The reporter from Xin Sheng She visited him at the Cangzhou Hotel yesterday and interviewed him in detail about the central government's suppression of Shi Yousan. A record of the conversation is as follows: ▲ Shi's Rebellion Can Be Easily Resolved Shi's army only has 30,000 to 40,000 men, of which only 20,000 to 30,000 are able to fight against the central and northeastern armies. However, Shi's army only wants to advance aggressively without considering the rear, which will inevitably lead to the isolation of the troops. Therefore, it is very easy to resolve. Moreover, the northeastern army is very strong and uses a large number of aircraft to attack. The destruction of Shi's troops can be expected soon. Now I am receiving a telegram from Cao Zhusan, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and Director-General, sent from Peiping and forwarded by Nanjing, reporting that the northeastern army's bombing by aircraft has been very effective. While speaking, he showed the telegram to the reporter. The original text is as follows: "To the Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Ma. The confidential telegram has been sent. There was only a small contact yesterday in the Qingfengdian area, and there has not yet been a formal battle. The northeastern army is emphasizing air power in this operation. There are already 34 aircraft participating in the front line. They bombed at night using moonlight, which has been very effective. Please quickly send 30 sheets of imprinted paper. Ge bows, Jianyin."</p>
<p>▲ Soviet Russian Assistance Regarding the rumor that Shi Yousan's rebellion was supported by the Third International's Russian funds, this is likely to be true. Otherwise, Shi's troops are trapped by lack of funds and have no way to resist the central government. As for the Shanxi army coming out, the rumor that it is in response to Shi and others is completely inaccurate. The Shanxi army is indeed sincerely participating in the suppression of Shi.</p>

<p>▲Please call for National Unity Against Japan and Aid to Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>▲Resolutions of the City Residents' Assembly the Previous Day</p>
<p>According to the Kuomintang News Agency, various circles of citizens in this city held a City Residents' Assembly for Suppressing Communists, Punishing Rebels, Opposing Japan, and Aiding Overseas Chinese at the Public Sports Ground in the South City the previous day. More than 100,000 citizens present unanimously advocated suppressing the Red bandits, punishing the rebels, permanently opposing Japan, and actively aiding overseas Chinese. On the spot, they also resolved to send a telegram to comfort and encourage Commanders Chiang and Zhang, as well as the soldiers on the front lines, to work hard to kill the enemy. They also decided to send a telegram to the whole country to unite against Japan and aid overseas Chinese, support the government's suppression of bandits and punishment of rebels, and other important proposals. These matters were already reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the above two telegrams were sent yesterday in the name of the assembly. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Telegram to All Circles of the Country: Respected Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Party Headquarters of all provinces, Municipal Governments of all provinces and cities, all newspapers, and all mass organizations: Since the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, the Three Principles of the People have been implemented, and warlords have been eliminated. In just a few years, a unified situation has been established. Although there have been many dangers and hardships, thanks to the concerted efforts of the government and the people, and the arduous struggle, stubborn enemies have been defeated and the chief culprits have been expelled. Just as military pacification and political tutelage were about to begin, rebellions occurred from time to time, and the Red bandits bred and entrenched themselves in Hunan and Jiangxi, becoming increasingly rampant. People's livelihoods have been deteriorating, and construction has been delayed as a result. Chairman Chiang has been working diligently day and night, supervising the troops in Jiangxi. Good news has been spreading repeatedly, and there is hope for sweeping away the bandits. However, Shi Yousan's rebellious and treacherous nature has led him to collude with Japanese imperialism externally, instigating Koreans to discriminate against Chinese and assisting them in making trouble. Internally, he colludes with the remaining Red bandits and the rebellious elements in Guangdong and Guangxi, vainly attempting to provide support. For the past ten days, they have been disturbing Hebei, destroying the national order and becoming the enemy of the people. If this is not punished, where is justice? If this is not punished, where is the law? All the citizens of Shanghai held a City Residents' Assembly for Suppressing Communists, Punishing Rebels, Opposing Japan, and Aiding Overseas Chinese at the Public Sports Ground in this city. More than 100,000 people enthusiastically participated, a sight never seen before. The assembly unanimously resolved to pass the following resolutions: (1) This assembly will send a telegram to comfort and encourage Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang, and the soldiers on the front lines, to work hard to kill the enemy and achieve complete success in the revolution. (2) A request will be submitted to the Central Government that if Shi's troops abandon their rebellion and return to obedience, they may be allowed to return, but Shi himself must not be tolerated in any way. He must be clearly punished as an example to the world. The citizens of this city are willing to raise 100,000 yuan to reward the capture of Shi. (3) A telegram will be sent to all organizations across the country to rise up in unison, oppose Japan and aid overseas Chinese, and support the National Government in suppressing bandits and punishing rebels. (4) A telegram will be sent to all military and civilian officials across the country to cooperate in the work of suppressing bandits and punishing rebels, in order to quell internal unrest and resist foreign aggression. The assembly also unanimously passed a declaration, which read: (The original text was published in yesterday's newspaper). Subsequently, all the citizens of the city vowed to abide by the points indicated in the declaration and fight to the end. We sincerely hope that all compatriots across the country will unanimously advocate and uphold justice together. It is fortunate for the country, and fortunate for the nation. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai City Residents' Assembly for Suppressing Communists, Punishing Rebels, Opposing Japan, and Aiding Overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>▲Telegram to Commanders Chiang and Zhang: The Assembly sends a telegram to Commanders-in-Chief Chiang in Nanchang and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang in Beiping, and to all revolutionary soldiers: Since the National Revolutionary Army began its Northern Expedition, five years have passed. During this period, remnants of warlords and subsequent rebellions, and repeated obstruction by imperialists, have been overcome thanks to the steadfast command of the Commanders-in-Chief and the courageous killing of the enemy by all the revolutionary soldiers. The country has been stabilized, and unification has been completed. Just as political tutelage was about to begin and people's livelihoods were about to be stabilized, the rebellions of warlords gave the Red bandits an opportunity to run rampant. The suffering in Hunan has been severe and continues to be so. The disasters have spread to almost the entire country. The Central Government, deeply concerned about the people's hardships, entrusted you, Commander-in-Chief, with the important task of suppressing the bandits. Commander-in-Chief, aware of the Red bandits as a grave internal threat, you have supervised the troops, and all the soldiers have been inspired to fight bravely. Good news has been spreading, and there is hope for suppressing the bandits in the Soviet areas. However, Shi Yousan has betrayed his faith, disregarded morality, lost his mind, and colluded with the Red bandits, relied on foreign aid, and seized the opportunity to raise troops and rebel. Alas, as Japanese imperialism is instigating Koreans to massacre our overseas Chinese compatriots, and the remnants of the Red bandits are still making their last stand, Shi Yousan is acting recklessly, disturbing the North. How can anyone with a conscience tolerate this? If this is not punished, where is justice? If this is not punished, where is the security of the people? The Central Government has been lenient in the past, tolerating evil-doers, but the people have suffered. We hope that you, Commanders-in-Chief, will respect the will of the people, reorganize the troops, and launch a major attack to eliminate these vile elements. Only then can the rebellious elements in Guangdong and Guangxi lose their support, and the Red bandits in Jiangxi and Fujian be unable to prolong their existence. You, Commanders-in-Chief, and all the revolutionary soldiers, have embraced the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and have already become the vanguard of the people. Our people will also follow and strive to support you until the stubborn enemies are swept away and the rebel leaders are captured. We hope that within ten days, a great victory will be achieved. The Shanghai City Residents' Assembly, held today, on the anniversary of the national humiliation, respectfully represents three million citizens in extending our condolences and encouragement to you, Commanders-in-Chief, and all the revolutionary soldiers. We also vow to unite as one and become the rearguard of all the revolutionary soldiers. We especially hope that after suppressing the rebellion and eliminating the bandits, the country will be unified, and all levels will work together to resist foreign powers, avenge the killing of our overseas Chinese compatriots in Korea, and wash away the shame of the treaty signed under duress several decades ago. We look up to the wind and await good news. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai City Residents' Assembly for Suppressing Communists, Punishing Rebels, Opposing Japan, and Aiding Overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>Preparing for the Establishment of an Urgent Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Xu Jingren, Chairman of the Relief Committee, stated that this year's continuous rain has caused disasters in sixteen provinces, including Sichuan, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. The disaster area is vast, and the disaster situation is enormous, unprecedented in a century. In addition to requesting the government to quickly raise huge funds for relief, he also appealed to the society. On July 28th, he, along with Wang Ting and Li Zucuo, permanent members of the committee, invited dignitaries from all walks of life to a meeting at Jue Lin to discuss ways to relieve the flood disasters in various provinces. It was decided on the spot to establish the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Urgent Relief of Flood Disasters in Various Provinces and to hold a preparatory meeting at Renji Hall yesterday.

<h3>Inspection of Yongbo Ships for Epidemics</h3>
<p>▲Implementation Begins Today</p>
<p>The Health Bureau and the Shanghai Port Quarantine Office, due to the discovery of true cholera in Ningbo, will send medical officers to inspect ships coming to Shanghai from Ningbo, starting on August 1st, to prevent the spread of the disease. They will also provide free cholera vaccinations to facilitate prevention. They have separately notified various shipping companies. Large shipping companies such as China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, and Taikoo are very clear about the importance of this kind of epidemic prevention measures and are doing their best to support and promote them.</p>
<h3>Wu Liande Talks About the Recent Situation of Cholera</h3>
<p>▲Two Deaths in the Public Concession</p>
<p>▲Cases Also in Zhoupu, Pudong</p>
<p>According to Dr. Wu Liande, Shanghai and other places have had continuous rain this year, which can easily lead to epidemics. Therefore, since the beginning of summer, the health authorities in Shanghai City, the Public Concession, and the French Concession, in view of the effectiveness of last year's epidemic prevention cooperation, have made even greater efforts in cholera prevention this year. The health authorities in the French Concession began preventive vaccinations on April 1st. Other Chinese areas and the Public Concession also began holding them on May 1st. To date, 500,000 people have been vaccinated. At the same time, more attention has been paid to those suffering from gastrointestinal diseases to see if they have any signs of cholera. There have been two cases of cholera in the Public Concession, both of whom have died. One was discovered on July 24th, and the other was discovered on July 28th. However, it has not yet been confirmed whether the two cases were true cholera. Therefore, Shanghai can still be considered a non-epidemic port. However, in Zhoupu Town, Pudong, which is about 30 li from Shanghai and has a population of about 14,000, two children have been found to have cholera. Both are about five or six years old. Zhao's young son developed cholera symptoms on the 29th of this month and died the next day. The Central Health Laboratory (Director Dr. Chen Muyi) confirmed that the rice-water-like excrement he discharged contained true cholera bacteria. The father of the deceased also died a few days ago with the same symptoms. Another child, surnamed Song, developed cholera symptoms on the 30th of this month and was sent to the hospital. The results of the examination of his excrement also contained true cholera bacteria. Because Zhoupu Town is directly under the jurisdiction of Nanhui County and does not belong to the scope of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Director Hu of the Health Bureau is negotiating with the local authorities to select and send doctors to assist in the prevention and has begun vaccinating all families in Zhoupu. All passengers on the small trains from Pudong to Zhoupu and all people traveling between Shanghai and Pudong must be vaccinated. Due to the surge in river water, ferry services have been temporarily suspended, so the focus of prevention has had to shift to the railway transportation area. There is a hospital in the area with ten beds, but preparations have been made to increase the number of beds at any time when necessary to facilitate the work of doctors and nurses. Shanghai and Zhoupu are very close, which is why the Chinese health authorities urgently want to eliminate the cholera before it spreads. Because cholera has been discovered in Ningbo, officials have gone to Wusong to administer cholera vaccinations to passengers coming to Shanghai from Ningbo. The local health authorities have now adopted the above-mentioned methods of early prevention, so I hope that cholera can be eliminated in the future.</p>
<h3>Funeral Gifts for the Song Family Donated to Zhongshan Hospital</h3>
<p>▲Collected by Central Banks in Various Places</p>
<p>Since Madam Song passed away in Qingdao, her sons, Minister T.V. Soong, T.L. Soong, and T.A. Soong, decided to follow Madam Song's instructions, and refused all forms of empty ceremony. The funeral committee then decided to transfer all the funeral gifts for good deeds. All friends who sent condolences, regardless of the amount, will be donated to the Zhongshan Police Hospital as expenses, to leave a permanent memorial to Madam Song. The funeral gifts can be directly submitted to the Central Bank in various places for collection, so that they can be sent to the hospital, and the receipts will be sent to the Song Funeral Committee for listing in the records, in lieu of memorial services. This intention has been notified so that everyone knows. The people who jointly proposed to issue this public notice were economic leaders and friends of Minister Soong, including Xu Kan, Huang Weiqin, Chen Fengzhan, Li Jue, Deng Mianren, Wu Qiding, Chen Xing, Tang Shoumin, Zheng Jian, Zhang Shouyong, Zhang Fuyun, Qin Fen, Li Tiaosheng, Cheng Shudu, Chen Qinghua, Zou Lin, Jiang Weixian, Zhu Boquan, Xu Meisun, Yang Jun, Lin Tianji, Xie Zuokai, Jia Shiyi, Zhou Shouliang, Qin Jingfu, Li Chengyi, and Xi Demao.</p>
<h3>American Businessman Mason Will Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The US Commercial Counselor's Office in this city has received news that Mr. Mason, Director of the Department of Foreign Trade Promotion of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, will arrive in Shanghai around August 14th. He will be accompanied by a commercial delegation, including banker Mr. Leone and manufacturer Mr. Tao Yier.</p>
<h3>Yoshino Returned to Japan Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese maritime communications negotiations have been going on for a long time, but have not yet concluded. There are still points of disagreement between the two sides, which makes it difficult to reach a conclusion in the near future. However, Yoshino, the Japanese representative, suddenly had an urgent matter to return home and could not stay in China any longer. He took a boat to the east yesterday. Wu Nanru and Zhong E, our representatives, went to Shanghai again to contact Yoshino the day before he left, in order to facilitate progress.</p>
<h3>Anhui People Request Punishment of the Remnants of the Ni Clan</h3>
<p>▲Huang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>When the warlord Ni Sichong occupied Anhui, he massacred members of the people's party and was known as a butcher. Huang Yuanzhen, his chief of military law, helped him to do evil, further fueling the flames and wantonly acting cruelly, and was called an executioner by the people. Since Ni's downfall, Huang has disappeared without a trace, so the victims could do nothing. Recently, it was heard that Huang was coming to Shanghai. Those from Anhui who had suffered from his poison in Shanghai were greatly angered upon hearing this and are now gathering to discuss countermeasures, determined to petition the government to investigate and punish him in order to appease the people's grievances and thank the people of Anhui.</p>
<h3>Business Tax on Department Stores Approved for Reduction</h3>
<p>▲Result of the Trade Association's Petition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Department Store Trade Association previously stated that the business tax rate was too high to bear and contradicted the Ministry of Finance's interpretation. It sent representatives to Beijing to petition and also sent a letter to the Tax Rules Research Committee of the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it forward a letter to the City Authorities to request a reduction. After going, it received a reply from the City Chamber of Commerce saying, "In direct reply, your letter of July 15th was received, stating business difficulties and requesting a special letter to the City Authorities to reduce the tax rate in accordance with the rate for foreign goods businesses. This Association has submitted a special letter to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's Business Tax Preparation Office, requesting a review and decision. Now, a letter from the Office, Zheng Zi No. 5, states: 'Your Association's letter requesting that the business tax on department stores be changed to the tax rate for Beijing-Guangzhou foreign goods businesses has been submitted for review. The Ministry of Finance has issued an order to investigate and reply to the Bureau, stating that the nature of department stores is the same as that of Beijing-Guangzhou foreign goods businesses and should be allowed to be taxed at a rate of 0.2% of turnover to show fairness.'" (Omitted below).</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Shanghai Municipal Council Meeting</h3>
<p>▲Taxation of Unregistered Land</p>
<p>▲Suggestions for Adding a Public Welfare Department</p>
<p>Land originally owned by Chinese people in the concession, not registered in the name of foreign merchants at the consulate, and not rebuilt as Western-style houses, is collectively referred to as unregistered land. Historically, there has been no need to pay any taxes to the Municipal Council. The issue of taxation on unregistered land in the concession was also mentioned in Judge Feitang's report. The Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession raised this issue for discussion at its regular meeting on Wednesday evening and decided to submit it to Superintendent Fei Xindun to prepare a summary and make a decision. Next, the issue of the Municipal Council handling the Pingluo rice issue was discussed and it was decided to postpone it. However, the issue of adding a Public Welfare Department to the Municipal Council will be considered when preparing the next year's budget. Father Foucault of the Xujiahui Observatory is about to retire, and the Municipal Council accepted the proposal of the Chairman and decided to entertain him in mid-August and present him with a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Special News from the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>▲Pilotage Fee Increase Postponed On the 15th of last month, foreign ship pilots in this port demanded an increase in fees, resulting in a strike. The Director of the Harbour Bureau of the Customs intervened to mediate, and work was resumed on the 22nd. On one hand, various shipping companies held public discussions and added pilotage fees as appropriate, and this matter was concluded. Now that the two-week deadline has arrived, the shipping companies believe that the current business situation is weak and generally advocate postponing implementation. The increase will not be implemented for the time being. The shipping companies will notify the Pilots' Union of this intention.</p>
<p>▲American Giant Ship Arrives in Shanghai The American Da Lai Shipping Company built two of the largest cruise ships for 60 million yuan each, each with 32,000 tons, one named the President Hoover and the other named the President Coolidge, in order to expand its Pacific shipping business. The beauty of its cabins and the magnificence of its layout are unprecedented on the Sino-American route. It is also very fast, traveling at 19 to 21 nautical miles per hour. The first ship, the President Hoover, has already been completed. This past Tuesday, it left the New Pie to go to New York, where it will be open for public viewing for three days. The engine will be powered by electricity. A telegram arrived yesterday stating that the ship is approved to set sail for Shanghai on the 6th of this month and is expected to arrive in Shen on September 18th. When it arrives in Shanghai, the company will send invitations to various sectors to visit the ship. The second ship, the President Coolidge, is scheduled to sail on October 15th. Each of these two ships is equipped with aircraft to deliver mail.</p>
<p>▲Resumption of Service of the Shenhu Small Steamer The Shenhu small steamer has been suspended for a long time due to the flood. In recent days, the weather has cleared and the water level in areas such as Lucheng and Lili has receded slightly. In order to maintain inland river transportation, the various steamer companies have resumed the service of the Shenhu small steamer yesterday. It is expected that Suzhou and Hangzhou will also be able to find ways to pass through today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Robbed of Opium The Zi Lin Bao reported that after the Lianhe ship of the Jardine Matheson Company arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday, the captain reported that at around 9:00 PM on Sunday night, the ship arrived at Zhenjiang and berthed alongside the ship. Just as it was about to unload the cargo, a small boat suddenly sailed up. About 30 people in the boat, holding pistols and rifles and wearing ragged military uniforms, boarded the Lianhe ship and used their guns to threaten Chinese and foreign crew members, ordering them not to speak out and sending people to guard the main roads, prohibiting anyone from going up or down. They then went to the engine room to search in detail and found 25 packages of opium, worth about 50,000 yuan. They then transported the opium to the small boat and forced the captain to write a note proving that they had taken nothing else besides the prohibited opium. After obtaining the note, the small boat then fled into the night. The Lianhe ship usually has British warship protection, but there was none this time. There were also no British warships anchored in Zhenjiang that day. It is likely that the gang knew about this, so they dared to come to the ship to rob the opium. However, they did not commit any crimes against the passengers and miscellaneous goods on the entire ship.</p>
<h3>Traffic Situation After the Restoration of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>According to news from both lines, the railway tracks between Zhenjiang and Nanjing stations on the Beijing-Shanghai line and near the Baogai Mountain Tunnel were washed away by rainwater. The Engineering Department of the line supervised the employees to work day and night to repair them, and traffic was restored on the 26th of last month. However, all the construction was temporary in nature, in order to restore traffic quickly. In recent days, trains passing through the area have not yet lifted the restriction of "proceeding cautiously and slowly", so trains are inevitably slightly delayed due to the reduced speed. Special trains carrying gravel and sleepers are now being dispatched to the area for active work. Once the roadbed and tracks are restored and consolidated, trains can travel smoothly.</p>
<h3>Both Lines are Taking Careful Precautions</h3>
<p>▲The Director of the General Affairs Office Convened a Training Meeting for the Entire Line's Police and Inspectors</p>
<p>The positions of Chief and Deputy Chief Inspectors of Police on both lines were abolished on the 22nd of this month, and all matters of the Inspection Office have been merged into the command of the General Affairs Office of the line. Deputy Chief Inspector Fan Zhaolan was reassigned as a specialist of the Ministry of Railways and is still working at the Railway Bureau, assisting in the management of the Inspection Office. Now, Hu Tianjun, the Director of the General Affairs Office of the line, took advantage of the beginning of the takeover and the urgent defense situation on both lines, and on the afternoon of July 29th, he led specialist Fan Zhaolan to convene all the inspectors for a training meeting in the newly built house at the Shanghai North Station. He generally said that the inspectors must invigorate their spirits, unite with all departments, and pay close attention to defense. Fan Zhaolan also spoke, encouraging all officers to step up defense, straighten up their uniforms, and pay attention to their spirits. The entire body was invigorated, and it is expected that the defense of the line will be further tightened in the future.</p>
<h3>工部局對於工廠法態度</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, because the National Government is scheduled to implement the Factory Act on August 1st, held a meeting last Wednesday to discuss the matter. Previously, the Municipal Council had expressed its desire to improve industrial conditions and had attempted to pass an appendix to the law banning child labor in 1925. However, due to the lack of labor regulations outside the concession at that time, labor laws were not promulgated within the concession either. Now that the National Government has announced its labor policy, the Municipal Council can also express its attitude. However, before the Municipal Council decides to adopt and implement the appendix, legal procedures must be completed. As for the need to ban employment, the Municipal Council has never doubted it. At the meeting on July 29th, the Municipal Council unanimously approved the principle of labor regulations. However, because the scope of the Factory Act promulgated by the National Government is extremely broad, it is believed that it will take a considerable period of time for industry to comply with the standards stipulated in the law. Based on the suggestions of Chinese members, the Municipal Council expressed the opinion that the initial work for the implementation of the Factory Act must include the following items: (1) working hours during the day and night, (2) the age at which young workers can enter factories, (3) rest days and holidays, (4) compensation for industrial accidents and industrial diseases, (5) bonuses, (6) maternity benefits, (7) banning apprenticeships, (8) labor-management discussion bodies, (9) factory records.</p>

<h3>黄包車夫拾金不昧</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Driver's Honesty in Returning Lost Money</p>
<p>▲ Sincerity and honesty can inspire the world</p>
<p>▲ The loser rewarded him with foreign money and then accepted it.</p>
<p>Rickshaw driver Xu Buyun, 39 years old, from Funing, lives at No. 2 Yongqing Lane, Huining Road, South City. Yesterday, at about 5:00 in the morning, Xu was pulling his rickshaw out of the rickshaw depot, continuing his daily hard work. Suddenly, a young customer came up to him and hired a rickshaw to 61 Lafayette Road, French Concession, Yongxing Niu Zuo. After agreeing on the fare, Xu pulled him to his destination. The young man got off the rickshaw in a hurry, paid the fare, and hurried into a small alley. Xu continued to look for a second customer. Before long, an old man hired a rickshaw to Nanyang Bridge. After the old man got off the rickshaw, Xu glanced at a paper package left on the rickshaw seat. Xu asked the old man urgently, but the old man shook his head and replied that he had not lost anything. Xu opened the package and examined it carefully. What appeared before his eyes was a pile of banknotes, silver dollars, and more than one hundred haoyin coins. However, Xu was honest by nature and did not covet unexpected wealth. He thought that he had only worked twice just now. If it was not left by the old man, it must belong to the young man, the first passenger. He immediately pulled the rickshaw to the entrance of the alley where the young man got off on Lafayette Road, and sat waiting for the loser to come and find him. He waited for a long time, but the young man did not come. In order to cherish his time, Xu went straight to the Second District General Office of the Zhaozhou Road Public Security Bureau to report the situation, and temporarily deposited the 47 yuan and five jiao in silver dollars, 119 jiao in small silver coins, and 16 copper coins in the office, waiting for the loser to claim them. However, it was already noon, so Xu returned home for lunch. As soon as he arrived at Yongqing Lane, the young loser was already waiting there. It turned out that when the young man hired the rickshaw, he had seen Xu pulling the rickshaw out, and expected that the rickshaw driver must live nearby, so he came to wait specially. As soon as Xu saw the young man, he told him the truth and went to the Second District General Office together. After Xu proved that there was no mistake, and the young man stated the number of items lost, which completely matched, Wang District Chief asked in detail. The young man supplied his name as Wei Guozhen, from Nanjing, 22 years old, claiming that he had important matters in the morning, which caused him to forget all the money on the rickshaw. He deeply regretted his carelessness. After Wang District Chief finished asking, he said that the rickshaw driver Xu Buyun worked hard, was honest by nature, and was able to see money and not take it, which was really rare. He immediately praised him and offered him the reward of ten yuan as compensation, which Xu declined in every possible way before accepting it. Although the matter is trivial, it is indeed rare in modern society.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Zhang Shiming Responds to Zhou Miaoying</h3>
<p>▲ Regarding the case to confirm the mother-son relationship</p>
<p>Zhou Miaoying (i.e., Zhang Zhou Shi) sued Zhang Xu Shi, Zhang Zhou Qu, etc., to confirm the mother-son relationship. In the appeal to the High Court, the respondent Zhang Xu Shi, through lawyers Zhu Sifu, Jiang Yiping, Cai Nipei, etc., responded. The response is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the case with Zhou Miaoying (i.e., Zhang Zhou Shi) being sued to confirm the mother-son relationship, the reasons for the response are hereby presented. The appellant in this case is making an unreasonable commotion, requesting to confirm the mother-son relationship. After the first instance judgment of your esteemed court rejected this claim, the appellant shows no remorse and continues to present reasons for dissatisfaction in lengthy documents, hoping to confuse the hearing. However, the truth is undeniable and cannot be misrepresented. The original statement fabricated facts. The respondent Qu An, either because of his young age or out of unwillingness to speak, has not provided detailed accounts. However, the respondent personally witnessed the events and cannot deny the truth or make reckless statements. Here, the most obvious facts and the most absurd arguments in the original appeal are briefly pointed out below: (1) The original statement claims that the appellant gave birth to a son, namely the respondent Qu An, etc. It is found that the appellant gave birth to Qu An in the first year of the Republic of China and another son named Qiaoshi the following year. When the appellant left, the second son was only four years old. Later, he died of meningitis at the age of nine, after being raised by the respondent. This is a well-known fact. Why does the appellant only mention one son? Could it be that she knows she abandoned her children and left without guilt, making it difficult to express? (2) The original statement claims that after Zhang Xu Shi came into the family, she became jealous and abusive, etc. The respondent came to the family in the third year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty. Qu An was born in the first year of the Republic of China. Therefore, the respondent came to the family long before the appellant had children. If abuse and jealousy were true, how could the appellant have safely given birth and had two sons? (3) The original statement also claims that she was not allowed to live in the same house and was forced to live with relatives, etc. The year the appellant entered the family was the same year the respondent came to the family. From then on, they lived harmoniously in one room and had children. Until the winter of the fifth year of the Republic of China, they lived together for six years. Then, the appellant suddenly took advantage of people's lack of preparedness and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, tailors were sent everywhere to search for her, but without any news. Who forced her? What does "not allowed" mean? What is the surname of the so-called relative? Such reckless and absurd statements are truly shocking. (4) The original statement claims that the respondent designed an encirclement, not allowing communication with the appellant, with the intention of separating the mother and son in the future. Numerous letters were intercepted by the respondent, harming the natural bond of kinship, etc. The respondent, as a secondary wife, should treat all children as her own. Moreover, she has her own children. Why would she need to separate the mother and son? The appellant was once a prostitute and unfamiliar with family etiquette and restraints. Her sudden departure and the child remaining with the family made her realize that it was irreversible and she did not have undue expectations (as seen in the appellant's letters). Therefore, for several years, there was no news. It was not until after the twelfth or thirteenth year of the Republic of China that she reappeared in Shanghai, first called Huarui, then Xiaochen, and finally Huaruiying. The letters mentioned in the original statement were from this period. Someone familiar with her persuaded the late husband, Shiming Gong. However, the late husband believed that she resumed her old profession, showing no respect for his family and sons, and was unwilling to forgive her. This can be seen from the tone of her letters. The original statement's claim of interception is a serious misrepresentation. (5) The original statement also claims that Qu An's engagement to Xu Shi was advocated by the respondent, and when he married, she was not allowed to see the appellant, as if there was no mother-son relationship, etc. Qu An's engagement to Xu Shi was decided by the late husband, Shiming Gong, when Qu An was only six years old. There is a marriage agreement from the astrologer Kang Daji as proof (to be verified during the trial). All matters related to the wedding were presided over by the head of the family. As the head of the family, the respondent naturally took full responsibility. Even if the appellant were still a member of the family, the respondent would still have the right to make these choices. It is a mistake to consider it a trap. The above points are the factual errors in the original statement, which Qu An did not know in his childhood or knew but was unwilling to say. Therefore, the respondent must clarify these points to avoid distorting the truth. The following are the reasons for dissatisfaction raised by the original statement regarding the first instance judgment's perceived violations of moral and legal regulations. The points of erroneous views are refuted one by one below: (6) The original statement claims that the appellant was forced by the first wife to live with relatives, and the words used by the agent lawyer in the agreement cannot represent the facts, etc. This is nothing more than an attempt to change the facts in order to overturn the agreement. After a agent lawyer is legally appointed, the effect of all actions and words made by the agent directly affects the principal. The appellant can read simple novels. At the time of the agreement, she personally reviewed it in detail from beginning to end and signed it. It has already been attached to the file and closed. All the amounts listed in it have been received by the appellant one by one. (7) The original statement's first instance moral concepts and legal views are even more erroneous, citing ancient and modern evidence, listing five items A, B, C, D, and E, explaining that new laws recognize that the relationship between a biological mother and child cannot be extinguished. The articles cited are not consistent with the facts of this case. The main points are divided into two categories, new law and old law, to avoid complexity. (A) Regarding the new law, Article 13 of the Implementation Law of the Family Section of the current Civil Code states, "The rights and obligations between parents and children shall be governed by the provisions of the Family Section of the Civil Code from the date of implementation of the Family Section of the Civil Code." The only articles in Chapter 3 of the same section that can be regarded as provisions concerning the relationship between parents and children are Articles 1059, 1060, and 1084 to 1090. Other provisions, such as those on guardianship, support obligations, and the right to support, and the status of members of the family council, all include the mother-child relationship, but all are based on whether they are members of the same family group (i.e., family). Now, is the confirmation requested by the appellant referring to all the provisions of the Family Section? The appellant's qualification as a member of the family group has been lost, and there is no possibility of such a relationship arising. If the confirmation requested is simply the four words "mother-child relationship," like the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren and siblings, and is a legal term, then there is no such distinguishing provision in the entire Family Law. It is unknown what the subject matter of the judgment and the scope of execution are. Even the precedents of the Supreme Court cited in item A of the original statement all contain the words "mother-child relationship," but this is only a legal term for investigating the origin of the principle and is by no means the judgment of each case. Even if there are only these four words, reading the original judgment at the time reveals that the two parties still had a dispute, which was used as the object of the request to determine the scope of the judgment. This can be asserted. (B) Regarding the old law, the Tang, Ming, and Qing legal codes state that a married or divorced mother still has the articles of filial piety and posthumous gifts with the children of her former husband. The family of etiquette has always advocated caution and is by no means without distinction. The commentary on the chapter on mourning garments in the Book of Etiquette states that the son of a divorced or remarried mother serves her as a wife, and the righteousness says that the divorced mother and the remarried mother are not proper for serving her. The mother of a divorced wife is expected to serve for a year, which means the mother had betrayed the deceased husband, so the period of serving is shortened to one year to honour the deceased husband. In case the husband has passed away, and the divorced mother is also deceased, the son would wear mourning attire, a practice that is not commonly practised, as described in the Book of Great Dai. A divorced mother is most likely sent back to her clan. Cai Shi said that a divorced mother should not be remarried and should observe mourning for her father, which is considered appropriate. If the divorced mother remarries, it means she has severed ties with her former husband and lost her chastity to another person and has also severed ties with her son, and no mourning will be observed. The commentary on the one-year mourning garment states that if the father dies and the stepmother remarries, mourning will still be observed to express the gratitude for the stepmother's upbringing, as stated by Qin Shi Huitian. Cai Shi Dejin said that when the mother remarries, she has severed ties with the father, and the love between mother and son is also severed. Therefore, if the husband dies and the mother remarries, the son will not observe mourning if he does not approve. Jiang Shi Zhaoxi said that the scripture only mentions the remarriage of the stepmother and does not mention the death of the father and the remarriage of the mother. It can be inferred that the remarriage of the stepmother includes the biological mother, and if the son does not approve of the biological mother's remarriage, he will not observe mourning. It can be seen that the appellant in this case separated from the family as a concubine. Her departure was different from a situation where the husband passed away and she could not survive on her own. The circumstances are completely different. She secretly left with her young child. It was not Shiming Gong who sent her away. After she left, the infant was in her arms, and searches were conducted everywhere, but there was no news. Thinking back to her resolute departure, vowing never to return, it is truly shocking. After more than ten years, when she was tired of traveling and wanted to return, she suddenly wanted to count the favors and talk about etiquette. This cannot be allowed. (8) The original statement attacks the errors in the first instance judgment, claiming that the original judgment believed the agreement stated that Qu An could not claim any more benefits, and therefore, based on Article 287 of the Civil Procedure Regulations, it was deemed that a confirmation lawsuit could not be filed, etc. The reason for the original judgment was that the legal relationship was empty and there were no fixed and concrete facts that could be used as the object of the lawsuit. The essential elements of the lawsuit were lacking. Even with the confirmation judgment in Article 287 of the Civil Procedure Regulations, there was no legal benefit. Therefore, this lawsuit could not be filed. The sentences recorded in the agreement, such as "no longer claiming any rights" and "never having any property or other relationship with Qu and his family," were further investigations into the case and were not the cause and effect. As for the obligation of support, which is a provision concerning public interest, even if the person entitled to support has the intention to waive the right, the court cannot consider it valid, etc., this is because the opposing agent lawyer did not hear about it when the agreement was established and only listened to the one-sided claims of his client. At the time of the agreement, the parties had a fact of paying and receiving 40,000 yuan in the name of lifelong support fees. However, the ordinary payment was periodic, while this was a one-time payment. Since it has already been paid once, there should be a record of no property relationship in the agreement to show good faith. The original appeal claimed that this record was a waiver of the right to support, which extinguished the mother-child relationship and was legally invalid. The blood relationship is rooted in nature and cannot be created or extinguished by human power. Therefore, there is a relationship and there is a relationship. The Family Section of the Civil Code regulates the relationship of rights and obligations. Therefore, there is a relationship but no affection. The two are completely different. The original statement confused them, which is wrong. (9) The original statement also claims that this case is the most serious of personal lawsuits, but Qu An did not appear in court, and the original trial did not summon him again. In the appeal trial, he must be ordered to appear in court for questioning, etc. According to the current litigation practice, the lawyer agency system is applied. If the presiding judge considers it necessary for the person to appear in court, he can order the person to appear in court himself. This is not limited to personal lawsuits and depends on the difficulty of resolving the dispute, regardless of the seriousness of the situation. In this case, the appellant's claim of a biological mother-child relationship was not denied by the respondent. The agreement established seventeen years ago can prove this. Therefore, there is no dispute over whether it is a biological relationship. However, whether the plaintiff's request is justified and can be legally established must be investigated. To investigate this issue, there are the case files from the previous case, the records from the first instance of this case, and the pleadings of the agents of both parties, which are clear at a glance. The opposing party insists on requiring the person to appear in court, knowing that the defendant grew up in a traditional family and is unwilling to appear in court because this matter concerns privacy. This is a deliberate attempt to make a meaningless request to coerce him. Playing with the word "serious" already reveals their intentions. (10) The original appeal also states that the respondent is acting as the legal mother, causing Qu An to deny the existence of his biological mother, and there is a need to list her as a defendant, etc. The plaintiff's only request is to confirm the biological mother-child relationship. The son she gave birth to is the main defendant. The claims of deception and encirclement cannot be supported by evidence and are fabricated. Therefore, although the appellant requested that the respondent appear in court, the respondent not only does not need to appear in court but also requests that the point of listing the respondent as a defendant be rejected first. In summary of the above responses, your esteemed court should investigate according to law, uphold the original judgment, reject the appeal, and order the appellant to bear the litigation costs, which is fair and convenient. Respectfully submitted to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. July of the 20th year of the Republic of China. The respondent, Zhang Xu Shi, through agents Zhu Sifu, Jiang Yiping, Cai Nipei.</p>
<h3>Rabid Dog Bites People, Causing Death</h3>
<p>▲ Two Boys and Girls Die from Poisoning</p>
<p>At Jiangjiatang in the southern part of Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai, a rabid dog suddenly appeared at the beginning of last month, biting anyone it encountered and destroying everything. The most seriously injured were Jinzhen, the eight-year-old daughter of Jiang Amao, a plasterer from Zini; Xun Di, the six-year-old son of He Wu Shi; and the water buffalo owned by Ma Agou. Although their families sought medical treatment, administered medication, and disinfected the wounds, none of it was effective. Therefore, the Ma family's water buffalo died of poisoning the day before yesterday, and Jinzhen and Xundi died of poisoning one after another yesterday. At the time of their deaths, they were barking like dogs, which was extremely terrifying. According to the farmers, anyone bitten by a rabid dog will die of poisoning after four weeks. Therefore, those who have been bitten are all worried.</p>
<h3>Reward for Arresting the Assassin of Song Zheng</h3>
<p>▲ A Reward of 26,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The assassination attempt on Song Ziwen failed, and the assassin is still at large. The authorities have offered a reward for his arrest. Now, it is known that the National Government believes that under the banner of the Republic of China, the assassin dared to plot against an important government figure. If the assassin is not strictly arrested and punished according to the law, it will not deter bandits. Under the heavy reward, there will surely be brave men. In addition to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau offering a reward of 5,000 yuan and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration offering a reward of 1,000 yuan for the arrest of the assassin, yesterday, the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan of the National Government added a reward of 20,000 yuan. Anyone who provides information leading to the arrest and conviction of the assassin will receive a total reward of 26,000 yuan. The Executive Yuan has issued an order to all military and police agencies to investigate.</p>
<h3>The Last Case of the French Concession Court</h3>
<p>▲ Lawyers Not Notified to Attend Court</p>
<p>▲ The Losing Party Declares an Appeal</p>
<p>The French Concession Court decided to transfer and reorganize yesterday. Yesterday morning, the two judges, Zhu and Gong, did not notify the lawyers representing the cases that had not been decided, such as the Chen Meixiang case against Zhang Hongying for abandonment and the Shen Meirong case against Shen Huang Shi for property dispute, according to established practice. They immediately made a judgment in the morning court. The losing parties all declared their dissatisfaction and requested to reserve the right to appeal. They immediately sent letters to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession and the Shanghai Lawyers Association, requesting them to uphold justice, and telegraphed the Ministry of Judicial Administration requesting to reserve the right to appeal.</p>
<h3>Two More Suspects Arrested in the Kidnapping Case of Ye Zengshou</h3>
<p>Ye Zengshou, the owner of the Zhongfu Import and Export Company on the Bund, was kidnapped by bandits on the 4th of last month and released for a ransom of 10,000 yuan. Recently, Wang Xichang and other Chinese detectives from the Huizi Patrol Room arrested two kidnappers, Chen Yaojiang and Xu Agen, at No. 32 Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan. Chen was the person who rented the house at No. 26 Xiangyin Road for the bandits. When Chen and Xu were arrested, they were assisted by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After the arrest, they were taken to the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention and then handed back to the detectives for delivery to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The Municipal Public Security Bureau suspected that Ma Deda, a Tongzhou native and tenant of No. 26 Xiangyin Road, and Zhuang Zhangsheng (i.e., Blind Zhuang), a Shanghai native and landlord, were involved in the case. The police were ordered to arrest the two and transfer them to the Special District Court. The Special District Court notified the Patrol Room to file a public prosecution. Yesterday morning, the Patrol Room officially filed the lawsuit. The Patrol Room's lawyer, Wang Yaochang, explained the case and requested that it be tried together with the Chen Xingjiang case. He stated that Zhuang Zhangsheng was the landlord of the houses at No. 26 to No. 32 Xiangyin Road. Judge Ge Zhitan reviewed the report, briefly questioned the two defendants, and ordered them to be remanded in custody pending a scheduled joint trial with the Chen Xingjiang case.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Bullets Dug Up While Demolishing a Wall</h3>
<p>▲ Approximately Six Thousand Six Hundred Bullets</p>
<p>Recently, the eastern end of Taiping Lane in West Wuchang Road was being demolished and rebuilt, and bamboo fences were erected. Every day, many workers were demolishing the wall foundations inside the site. At around 9:00 yesterday morning, the workers were demolishing the wall near the west side when they suddenly discovered a large number of bullets at the base of the wall. At that time, it caused a commotion among the neighbors. The bullets that were dug up numbered no less than 6,500, and many were connected to magazines. The workers collected them one by one and packed them into three hemp bags, which were taken to the Hongkou Patrol Room. It is said that the bullets were used for rifles.</p>
<h3>Explosion of a Steam Boiler in an American Umbrella Factory Injures People</h3>
<p>▲ Three Workers and One Neighboring Child Injured</p>
<p>At the United American Umbrella Factory at No. 44 Sanyi Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, at around 9:00 last night, while working the night shift and electroplating umbrella handles, the steam boiler suddenly exploded with a loud noise. Three workers and one neighboring child were seriously injured and were on the verge of death. The factory supervisor hired a car to take them to Tongren Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, the workers' injuries were relatively minor, but the child's life was in danger. The names are listed below: Zhou Taihe, 30 years old; Xu Xiangqing, 17 years old; Li Kou Lai, 13 years old; all from Jiangyin. There was also a child, Li Guocai, from No. 43, who was only 10 years old and was an only child. His father, Rui Fu, worked in the copperplate department of the Commercial Press. Guocai went to the factory to watch after dinner and was unfortunately caught in the crossfire. When the explosion occurred, the sound was like thunder and lightning flashed. The Zhabei fire truck rushed to the scene, but fortunately, the house was not damaged, and the truck returned. The residents in the area were frightened. Afterwards, the police from the Second Precinct of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau came to investigate the explosion and took the factory manager to the station to explain the situation to the Zhabei Judicial Section for investigation.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Young Woman Files for Divorce</h3>
<p>Qiu Xu Xiuqing, a young woman from Ningbo, is 27 years old. When she was 20 years old, she married Qiu Hexiang from the same village. They lived together in Lujiazhai, Pudong. Now, Qiu Xu Xiuqing has hired lawyer Wang Jianfan to draft a lawsuit and filed for divorce with the District Court. The reason is that the defendant does not care about life and is abusive. The defendant, Qiu Heqing, has also hired lawyer Gu Jirong to present a defense, requesting cohabitation. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Zhenhai opened a court hearing. Both parties attended court with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff, Qiu Xu Xiuqing, testified that after marrying the defendant, she gave birth to several children, all of whom died young. The defendant has no occupation and wanders around, acting like a hoodlum. I work in a cigarette factory to support myself. The defendant repeatedly forced me to borrow money from people. If I did not comply, I would be abused and beaten. On June 6th, I was attacked with firewood, and my arms and face were injured. The sub-landlords all witnessed it. Because they are afraid of the defendant, they dare not testify to avoid resentment. Therefore, my life is a living hell. All my clothes have been pawned. My monthly wages are also taken away. Such behavior is difficult to endure. I request that the divorce be granted. Next, the defendant, Qiu Heqing, 31 years old, testified that he did not want a divorce. Our relationship has always been good. In July of last year, the plaintiff's father became involved with a woman. Since then, the plaintiff listened to the woman's instigation and opposed me. (Judge asked) What do you do for a living? (Answer) I am a food supplier on a ship. I have not abused her. I can request an investigation. (Judge asked) If you have not abused her, why did the plaintiff file a lawsuit? (Answer) She completely listened to slander. It is not easy for my agent to marry a wife. Even if she is dead, I still want her bones. The judge said, You should go out and persuade your friends to talk to her. Maybe you can reconcile. The plaintiff stubbornly said, I am determined not to. The judge then asked Prosecutor Zhao to attend court to express his opinion. The debate began. The plaintiff's lawyer said that the defendant's nickname is Qiu Liuqiao. From this alone, the defendant's usual behavior can be inferred. The defendant has also repeatedly borrowed money from the plaintiff's father, Xu Senting, and there are IOUs. The defendant's lawyer stood up and argued that the borrowing may have happened, but there was no abuse. He requested that the lawsuit be rejected. The judge believed that the debate was over and awaited the verdict.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of the Rickshaw Puller Abducting a Woman</h3>
<p>▲ Zhu Debiao Sentenced to One Year in Prison</p>
<p>▲ Sang and Xu Sentenced to Six Months</p>
<p>Zhu Debiao, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, conspired with Sang Xiaoliuzi and Xu Erhuzi to abduct Zhuang Zhenying, an 18-year-old woman from Wuxi who had lost her way, at noon on the 23rd of last month. They hid her in the Xi'an Hotel on Xi'an Road and conspired to sell her into prostitution. Sang and Xu attempted to defile Zhenying but failed. The case was discovered and arrested by An Siben and Zhao Lianbi, Chinese detectives from the Hongkou Patrol Room, along with the suspected Cantonese woman Chen Aliu. They were all escorted to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the Special Court for interrogation and trial. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the court and sentenced Zhu Debiao to one year in prison, and Sang Xiaoliuzi and Xu Erhuzi to six months in prison each. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be two days for one day of imprisonment. The woman Chen Aliu was found not guilty. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Patrol Room announced that he would abandon the appeal, and she was released in court.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Merchants Expand Medical Services at Hospital</h3>
<p>The Cantonese Merchants Hospital, organized by Cantonese people in Shanghai, provides Chinese and Western medicine and obstetrics services, as well as charitable services such as providing coffins. The facilities are very comprehensive, and the newly built wards are elegant and clean with sufficient air, making them suitable for recuperation. Therefore, the number of patients has been increasing day by day, saving more than 30,000 people each year. The annual business expenses are more than 50,000 gold yuan. Recently, the medical services have been particularly developed. In addition to the Chinese Medicine Department hiring Guo Boliang, Zheng Zongjing, Li Bolu, and Ling Yiqin as doctors to preside over medical affairs, the Western Medicine Department, although Zheng Zixin and other doctors are in charge of medical services, is still insufficient to meet the needs. Recently, Dr. Huang Wen has taken on the role of voluntary medical officer at the hospital. Dr. Huang has served as a doctor in St. Thomas' Hospital and Sacred Heart Hospital in London, Rouji Hospital and Tung Wah Hospital in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, and as a professor at Guangzhou Public Medical School and the Dental School of the Xia Ge Medical University for Women. She has extensive knowledge and experience. Dr. Huang also recruited Wu Jishun, Mei Zhuosheng, Mao Kelun, Xiao Zuyu, Yin Yingsheng, Hu Runde, Kuang Cuie, and Chen Jiyao to serve as voluntary medical officers in the outpatient department. The hospital's board of directors warmly welcomed Dr. Huang and others' enthusiasm and decided that the doctors would begin providing consultations at the hospital on August 1st, sharing the medical services.</p>

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Zikawei Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the coastal area and the Yangtze River basin are hot and cloudy. There is a southeast wind here. The wind on the Yellow Sea is undirectional. The weather around Taiwan and the northern entrance of the Taiwan Strait is bad, with a major cyclone. The hurricane in the Pacific Ocean appears to be turning northwestward, approaching the east-northeast of the Dongsha Islands. However, because Taiwan has no reports coming to Shanghai, its position cannot be calculated. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 91.8, and the lowest was 76.6. Last year, the highest was 87.3, and the lowest was 77.0.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read your newspaper's report on the 30th of this month regarding the Huang Chu Jiu property liquidation case tried by the French Concession Court. The report on the court's decree was brief and not detailed, and there were discrepancies. Upon investigation, the court's decree on that day stated that Huang's family's representative requested to change the court's decree issued on July 18th. The plaintiff unanimously opposed it. The court found it inappropriate to change it. The two auctions should still be revoked. The liquidator and Huang's family representative requested to change the sale to a competitive sale. All parties agreed that it was beneficial and harmless. The liquidator and the representative should conduct a competitive sale together and submit a report for consideration. It was also heard that after the first auction was revoked, the buyer raised an objection. The court did not receive a request and therefore could not rule on it and should wait for a legal solution. Some creditors claimed that Huang had concealed property and requested an investigation, but no evidence was presented. The liquidator should investigate and handle the matter. Dong Shiyun, director and shareholder of the Gongfa Company, appeared in court and stated that he was unable to repay the debt. The liquidator should investigate all the shareholder's property and submit a report for consideration. As for Huang's estate report, it was based on over six million yuan. The movable property was estimated and calculated by experts from various industries. The real estate was calculated based on the current market value. The profits from rented land and buildings were estimated based on the contracted lease term of more than 20 years. All stocks, regardless of their actual value, could only be valued according to the face value. Who would have thought that today, due to the creditors' eagerness for compensation, the accountant's method of disposing of the property could not be carried out according to the original plan, and everyone would inevitably suffer losses. For example, the disposal of the Gongfa Company's various properties, when actually sold, was far less than the estimated price. The difference in loss will be as much as millions. Using that as an example, it can be determined that Huang's property cannot be sold at a fair price. Taking the rented land and buildings as an example, there was originally a profit of more than three million yuan. Now that it is being sold urgently, it is conceivable that it will not be able to obtain a considerable price. All of this was not expected at first. Now, a large portion of Huang's property has not been sold, so how can the accountant's report that it is only worth more than 1.7 million yuan be taken as a definitive conclusion? As for Huang's jewelry, it is certainly worth more than a few hundred yuan, but during Huang Chu Jiu's lifetime, he had already mortgaged tens of thousands of yuan of valuable jewelry for business operations. The amount of the mortgage and the mortgagors are all recorded in the liquidation report. How could there be any concealment? Fearing that rumors may be misrepresented, I hereby clarify. I hope you will investigate and publish it in the letter section to make corrections. Respectfully, to the Chief Editor of Shen Bao, Lawyer Tan Yigong.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Implementing the Factory Law in Our Country</h3>
<p>Chen Da</p>
<p>(2) Specific Discussions, Working Hours and Related Articles, 1. Young Workers: Children working in factories, between the ages of twelve and sixteen, we call young workers. Those smaller than young workers we call child laborers. However, our country currently lacks population surveys and has not adopted birth certificates, so proving age is very difficult. Therefore, our current survey does not ask about the age of children, but rather deals with the reality. There are many children in factories who, judging by their height and physique, are around ten years old. The working conditions of child laborers in many places are similar to those in the report of the Child Labor Committee (1924), but this report has had a considerable effect on public opinion. Because many new factories have gradually abolished the youngest children, and foreign-owned cotton mills (a total of thirty-four) now measure the height of children before employing them, admitting only those who meet the standard. This method of measurement has also been adopted by several Chinese-owned yarn and silk mills, but the height adopted varies. However, four feet two inches is a relatively common standard. This standard is based on the average of measurements of one thousand children. Several new-style silk reeling factories in Shanghai are gradually adopting Japanese-style cocoon boiling machines, which boil the cocoons in another room and then send them to the silk reeling workers. Therefore, the boiling work does not need to be the responsibility of child laborers. This has two benefits: the number of child laborers can naturally be reduced, and the temperature of the silk reeling room can be reduced because there is no need to boil cocoons, so the working conditions in the cocoon factory can be improved. The factory law of our country stipulates that young workers must be at least fourteen years old to work in the factory. According to the regulations for the implementation of the factory law, the method of proof is provided by the legal guardian. In practice, this kind of proof is unreliable. Generally, in order to alleviate the economic difficulties of the child's family, the guardian will definitely say that the smaller child is of legal age. There are usually several ways to prove age: 1. Proved by the child or legal guardian; 2. Determined by the employer or factory staff; 3. Determined by a judge or doctor. In India and Hong Kong, the method for young workers is mostly certified by doctors hired by the government. Before the child enters the factory, the doctor examines the body, and those who are strong are issued a permit by the doctor, and they can enter the factory to work with the certificate. Those who are not issued a certificate cannot work. The doctor also determines the age of the child, but does not pay attention to the proof of age, but pays attention to the health of the child. There are 11,895 child laborers in the six industries in Shanghai (according to the latest report of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, there are 27,482 child laborers in the ten industries). The most child laborers are employed in silk reeling, cotton spinning, printing, machinery, and tobacco cases. Except for foreign-owned cotton mills, which no longer use the youngest child laborers (their young workers must be at least four feet two inches tall), there are still very young child laborers in many Chinese-owned factories. However, most opinions believe that child labor should be banned. The author would like to contribute the following opinions on the method of banning: the government should appoint several doctors to examine the bodies of children, and those who are qualified will be given employment certificates. The qualified children must be a certain number of feet tall (determined after investigation) and at least twelve years old (the proof of age is not the main thing). The above methods have two difficulties: A. For children who have already been employed, another type of certificate must be issued to show the difference; B. The government must pay the cost of appointing doctors separately, but according to the experience of the United Kingdom, the cost is not very high. When doctors went to factories to check bodies in 1901, they charged two shillings and six pence for every five children, and six pence for each child from six children onwards. If children go to the doctor's clinic for examination, they will be charged six pence each. "After the second revision of the charging regulations, for every factory with more than ten children, a fee of two shillings and six pence is charged, and for those with more than one hundred, a fee of seven shillings and six pence is charged." The Hong Kong Industrial Children Ordinance was passed in 1922 and amended in 1929. When it was passed that year, children over ten years old could enter the factory to work. When it was revised, the age of children was raised to twelve years old. According to the report of the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, this amendment was not opposed by anyone, which shows that the legislation is easy to benefit workers from leniency to strictness. According to this survey, it is known that the working hours of male and female child laborers are roughly the same. However, the printing industry has special circumstances, because the workers in this industry generally do not work full shifts at night, but extend their working hours by a few hours during busy times. The average night work hours in the six industries are 9.2 hours for male workers, 8.7 hours for female workers, and 7.7 hours for child laborers. However, if the number of clock hours per shift is used as the standard, the average working hours in the six industries is 9.6 hours. The working hours in the cotton spinning industry, whether day shift or night shift, are mostly more than eleven hours. As for the number of shifts per day and night, except for the silk reeling and machinery industries, which only have one shift, most of the other industries have more than one shift. The chemical industry has 1.3 shifts per day and night, the food industry has 1.2 shifts (of which the tobacco industry has 1.02 shifts, or only a few night shifts, the cotton spinning industry has two shifts per day and night, each shift is almost twelve hours, the public utility industry has three shifts, each shift is eight hours. The above facts tell us that the ten-hour work system can be implemented in the Shanghai industry. However, the implementation of this system will cause economic losses to the textile industry (especially the cotton and silk industries). The author cannot estimate the total economic losses, because Chinese and foreign factories have not provided appropriate information on the value of products and fixed expenses. However, the economic losses suffered by the industry due to shortening working hours include at least the following three items: A. The reduction of output; B. The fixed expenses of closing the factory; C. Wages. After working hours are shortened, workers' fatigue can be reduced and work efficiency can be improved, so production is not necessarily reduced. However, this effect can only be achieved after a considerable period of time, and it is not a common phenomenon, because there are many factories whose output is based on machinery. Shortening the time means reducing production. As for the workers, whether they are paid by the hour or by the piece, most of them are unwilling to reduce their wages because of shortening working hours. As a result, the factory must at least pay the same wages as before. A small number of factories have made slight estimates of the economic losses of shortening working hours. Several cotton mills believe that reducing from twelve hours to ten hours will result in a total economic loss of 9%, of which the production volume alone will be reduced by 17%. A large-scale manufacturing plant shortened working hours (from 10:00 to 9:00) two years ago, and its total loss was 10%. According to the estimate of this factory, if it is reduced to eight hours again, the increased loss will be 12.5%. A public utility company employing 950 workers implemented an eight-hour work system two years ago, and its total loss was 8400 yuan per year. Working hours should be mentioned in the same breath as night work. Article 12 of the Factory Law of our country stipulates that child laborers shall not work between 7:00 pm and 6:00 am the next day, and Article 13 stipulates that female workers shall not work between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am the next day. In Hong Kong, child laborers under the age of fifteen are not allowed to work after 7:00 pm and before 7:00 am, and young workers under the age of eighteen are not allowed to work after 9:00 pm and before 7:00 am. In India, young workers and female workers are not allowed to work after 7:00 pm and before 5:30 am. Since the ban on late-night work in 1929, the Japanese cotton spinning industry has worked 17 hours a day and night, divided into two shifts (8.5 hours per shift). Those who use a one-shift system can extend the night work to 11:00 pm. If the factory law of our country is in accordance with the current regulations, there are only 16 hours of work per day and night, divided into two shifts. In addition to the economic losses, there are also practical difficulties. For example, the question of workers' dormitories. Most of the female workers in Japanese cotton mills have dormitories, so there is no problem in returning home after get off work at night. However, most of the female workers in Shanghai live in nearby villages. If they get off work at 10:00 pm at night, it will be difficult for female workers to return home. As for the dormitory floor, there are many shortcomings, and it seems that our country cannot imitate it. Based on the above facts and reasons, our country cannot currently implement a sixteen-hour work system per day and night, especially because international competition is fierce and the efficiency of our country's workers is too low. The author's suggestion is a ten-hour work system. For female workers and young workers, whether day or night, their working hours are ten hours. Within three years of the implementation of the factory law, the exception of the ten-hour work system for late-night work will be temporarily preserved as follows: (A) Some industries whose manufacturing work uses machinery and cannot be stopped continuously (any exception must be listed); (B) Seasonal industries (listed by enumeration, but the silk industry cannot be used as an exception); (C) Industries exclusively for male workers; (D) Those who encounter natural disasters and special incidents. Within three years, the industry should conduct in-depth research on the issue of banning late-night work, and must pay special attention to the following two things: (A) Can male workers replace female workers? Most cotton mill employers believe that this is impossible. Several cotton mills in Hunan and Hubei use male workers, but they are limited to rougher work. In Indian cotton mills, 4% of the workers are young workers, and female workers account for a small part. This situation is different from cotton mills in other countries, and it is not something that our country can imitate in a short time. A factory in Tianjin has recently implemented an eight-hour system, but it is said that this factory has always had difficulties in management. In order to alleviate the unemployment of workers, the two shifts have been changed to three shifts. Although production has increased by about 4% since the eight-hour work system was implemented, the industry strongly opposes it. Whether the new system can be successful is a question, but the relationship between labor and capital seems to have gradually improved, and night work has been reduced to ten times a month (but there is currently no confirmed report on how to change shifts at 10:00 pm at night so that female workers can return home without difficulty). Within three years, the industry should study how to avoid the unemployment of female workers or the reduction of sales after late-night work is banned. This is the question of increasing machinery. We can refer to Japan's experience. Japan spent three years preparing to abolish late-night work. We believe that the period is too long. Buying a large number of machines to avoid reducing production and reducing sales, we believe that it is too much of a concern. The facts and reasons can be found in John E. Orchard's "Japan's Economic Position". At the end of John E. Orchard's "Johan's Economic Position", there is also overtime work, and the wages are increased by one-third to two-thirds compared to the usual wages. These points seem to be consistent with the current situation and can be implemented. Regarding this issue, the author's suggestions are as follows: Child laborers are not allowed to have overtime work under any circumstances. Female workers on day and night shifts are also not allowed to have overtime work in order to protect the health of female workers and young workers. (2) Rest Days, Holidays, and Special Rest Days: Rest days, holidays, and special rest days should be discussed separately and comprehensively, because the rest and holiday conditions of various industries are different, so for the sake of clarity, they should be discussed separately. Because rest and holidays not only protect workers' health, but also reduce production, which is also part of the industry's economic losses, they should be discussed comprehensively. The factory law of our country stipulates that there is one day of rest every seven days, seven national holidays every year, and special holidays from seven to fifteen days every year (determined by the length of service of the workers). Most of these holidays must be paid. In addition, there are also relationships between holidays and reduced production, fixed expenses, etc. However, because this survey cannot collect data on these two levels, the total economic loss cannot be estimated. As for the partial losses, especially the payment of wages, can be briefly discussed as follows: (A) Rest days: In Shanghai's industries, there is generally rest time during the daily working hours, from 15 minutes for the short ones to one hour for the long ones, mostly during meals. As for the full-day rest days, the situation varies greatly. A small number of factories have no rest days in a month. Some factories adopt a work-count system. Although there are regulations on rest days on the surface, if workers work on rest days, they can get double wages. Workers are encouraged by this (especially piecework) to petition to work, so they can get more wages. Therefore, rest days exist in name only. Some industries are continuous, and their workers cannot have rest days, but their daily working hours are shorter than ordinary industries. In addition to the above situations, the remaining factories give holidays for rest days, and the number ranges from two to four days per month. According to this survey, the rest days of 176 factories are 2.6 days per month, so according to the actual situation, there are not many rest days. Although rest days are indispensable for the health of workers, the number of rest days can only be increased slowly and cannot be rushed due to the relationship between production and work efficiency. The average number of rest days per month for 176 factories is 2.6 days, of which 55 are paid and 121 are unpaid. Those who are paid are mostly factories that employ long-term workers, and they often adopt a wage increase system, for example, those who work 28 days a month get the wages of 30 days, and those who work 30 days get the wages of 33 days. Some foreign factories give the wages of 29 days to those who work 26 days a month (Sundays are not paid for rest). Rest days (and holidays) should be compared with the actual situation in other cities in our country, and then a concept can be obtained. According to the survey of 51 cities by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, there are 17 cities with more than 10,000 industrial workers in each city, of which six cities (Qingdao, Nantong, Shanghai, Wuchang, Guangzhou, Shunde) have more than 33 rest days and holidays per year, and two cities (Hankou, Yixing) have between 24 and 30 days. When Japan banned late-night work, there were four rest days per month. Since the ban on late-night work, there have only been two rest days per month. The United Kingdom has one and a half rest days per week, and India has four days per month, but most of them are unpaid. The articles in the factory law of our country regarding the payment of wages for rest days are obviously sympathizing with the workers. In order to improve their economic life, workers have recently often demanded an increase in their income, and therefore demanded the payment of wages for rest days. However, the payment of wages for rest days seems to be inconsistent with the principle. Workers should change their policy and demand an increase in wages.</p>
<p>The conference should investigate the cost of living in important industrial and commercial areas, and then formulate a cost of living index as a standard for setting the minimum wage. According to the factory law of our country, there are four rest days per month (i.e. 52 days per year) and eight national holidays, most of which must be paid. Judging from the payment of wages alone, the economic burden of the industry is already considerable. One factory employing 983 workers has made a calculation that it needs to pay 2565 yuan for one day of rest every seven days, and because of the continuous work, it also needs to hire an additional one-seventh of the workers on the seventh day, which is another type of expense. Cotton mills generally rest on Sundays without pay. One type of silk reeling factory believes that every Sunday rest will reduce the output by 3 loads per day, and the fixed expenses will increase by 275 taels per day (equivalent to 37.671 yuan in silver). According to this survey, the average number of holidays and holidays given by each industry each year is 32.1 days, or equal to two rest days per month and eight holidays. Therefore, we have assumed that there are two rest days per month and eight national holidays per year, which seems to be close to the actual situation. However, because the implementation of the ten-hour work has already had a significant economic impact on the industry, we believe that national holidays are paid and rest is not. Some factories (both Chinese and foreign) have gradually complied with the orders of the National Government and take holidays on commemorative days, but the situation is not consistent and the number of holidays is not uniform, ranging from one to eight days per year, but the trend is obvious, which is to follow the orders of the National Government and proceed on the one hand. This type of holiday has a considerable relationship with promoting patriotism and should be widely promoted. Some factories, in view of the difficulty of changing the customs of our country, still take holidays during the Lunar New Year in place of holidays, and this level is also in accordance with custom, and the government does not need to be too demanding. New Year's holidays are common. In summary, factories now give an average of 14.4 holidays per year, "i.e., 4.7 national holidays, 1.7 festival holidays, 3.9 New Year's holidays, and 4.1 Lunar New Year holidays." Regarding national holidays, 81 factories pay wages and 72 do not. Regarding festival holidays, 48 factories pay wages and 68 do not. Regarding Gregorian New Year's holidays, 66 factories pay wages and 107 do not. Regarding Lunar New Year's holidays, 31 factories pay wages and 91 do not. Since the actual situation is as described above, our suggestions for rest days and holidays are as follows: Eight national holidays are given each year with pay for the following reasons: This issue must take into account the health of workers and industrial production. If it is exclusively for the sake of health, the more rest days, the better, of course. However, for the country as a whole, the current rest days and holidays are still very few, as described above, so we can only temporarily set two days per month, plus eight national holidays per year. As far as rest days are concerned, they can be increased to four days per month after five years. As for the issue of production, international competition must be discussed. There are 190 large-scale Japanese factories in South Manchuria, and their average number of rest days per month is only 2.2 days. The degree of industrialization in Osaka is very high, but for 170 large-scale factories, the average number of rest days per month is only 2.9 days. The degree of industrialization in our country is immature, and the efficiency of workers is relatively low. If we add rest days and holidays, production will be even lower. How can we compete with foreign industries? In practice, there is no precedent for paying wages for holidays in foreign countries, and it seems to be a sound reason in principle. However, we believe that paying wages for national holidays has the good intention of promoting patriotism and can be implemented. Regarding the issue of workers demanding an increase in income, we should request the government to conduct scientific research on wages and living expenses as soon as possible in order to implement appropriate solutions. According to the factory law, 60 days of paid leave are given each year, and the cost is very high, but some factories now pay wages for holidays (commemorative days or festival holidays). One factory employing 55 employees believes that the wages for eight holidays will be 5900 yuan. However, if some of the current paid holidays are replaced, the increased cost will only be 1500 yuan. Cotton mills generally do not pay wages for holidays, so the wages for eight holidays will increase the total cost by 3%. In short, the current average number of rest days is 2.6 days per month, and the average number of holidays is 14.4 days per year. We believe that the factory law can stipulate that there are two rest days per month without pay, and eight national holidays per year with pay, which is equivalent to one-seventh of the cost of 60 days of holidays in the factory law.) Because the wage issue is fundamental, after the government has conducted considerable research on this issue, it will then study the issue of rest days and holidays in conjunction. Special rest days: In India and our country, there are often many workers who leave their hometowns to make a living. The people of both countries attach great importance to the concept of their hometown, so the method in India often gives workers the opportunity to return home to visit their families within a year, but without pay. The factory law of our country also has special holiday regulations in order to cater to the social ideas of the people of our country. The annual holidays are set from seven to fifteen days with pay, based on the length of service of the workers. The newly opened factories are not affected by this article. If the more historical factories have records of the length of service of workers, they feel that this is a huge economic burden. For example, one factory employing 567 people estimates the special holidays as follows: those who have worked for one to three years get seven days of leave, totaling 400 yuan; those who have worked for three to five years get ten days of leave, totaling 1700 yuan; those who have worked for five to ten years get fourteen days of leave, totaling 11600 yuan; those who have worked for more than ten years get fifteen days of leave, totaling 4400 yuan. One factory employing 225 employees estimates the cost of special holidays to be 6000 yuan per year. One factory with a staff of 601 people has the following expenses for special rest days: 167 people get seven days of leave per year, totaling 970 yuan; 76 people get ten days of leave per year, totaling 750 yuan; 214 people get fourteen days of leave per year, totaling 2850 yuan; 144 people get fifteen days of leave per year, totaling 2400 yuan. A large-scale factory with a total of 9300 workers estimates the cost of special holidays to be 107,000 yuan per year.</p>

<h3>World News in Brief</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>The Fisherman Reaps the Benefit</p>
<p>The shipowner of the British Aukra Com Pany, Yin Baila Zeng Cap Lngrightsen, recently caught a whale. The profit he made was more than a hundred times that of an ordinary whale. He really reaped the benefit of the fisherman. An ordinary whale can produce oil from its fat worth four hundred pounds, while the one Yin Baila Zeng got can be worth forty thousand pounds. The whale is not very big, and the fat production is naturally not much different from ordinary whales. However, the sailors suddenly cheered with great joy when they were cutting it open. It turned out that they had found a large piece of shapeless yellow material, weighing more than a hundred pounds. Do you know what this yellow material is? It turned out to be the extremely precious ambergris in the world. The price of each tael is twenty pounds, which is five times more expensive than gold. This kind of ambergris is extremely needed by manufacturers of perfume. No matter what kind of fragrance the perfume is made of, if ambergris is added to it, the fragrance will never fade. It had only been found twice in whales before, and the area was larger than this one. This is the third time. It is said that the whale's usual food is squid in the sea, and ambergris is produced from the sharp beak of the squid.</p>
<h3>Talks from a Northeastern Returnee</h3>
<p>— Holding a Buddha</p>
<p>A guest returned from Harbin and met him at the inn. He spoke of many trivial matters in the Northeast. Today, the Wanbaoshan case is causing a sensation across the country. I will record it hastily, not only to help the conversation. The guest said: Manchuria is located between the two major forces of Japan and Russia. It is not easy for the person in power to deal with the situation. The Japanese are especially insidious and malicious in their long-term plans. Japan only has 43,700 square miles with 85 million people, while Manchuria has 650,000 square miles with only 28 million people. Therefore, they are working hard to promote the policy of immigration and colonization, moving Japanese to Korea, and Koreans moving to Manchuria. The occurrence of this Wanxian tragedy is a clear proof of the Japanese policy of immigration and colonization. According to the Chinese farmers in the East, most of them came from the Denglai area of Shandong. They are diligent and hardworking, and are often jealous of by the Japanese and Koreans. Many have become rich households from scratch, but they lack a long-term vision and a spirit of mutual assistance. This is a shortcoming of ordinary Chinese people, which cannot be denied. However, the Japanese are not like this. There is a wealthy household who specializes in lending money to Korean farmers, and has won the favor of the Korean farmers, so they can be used without knowing it. This is another reason for the tragedy. There are bandits all over the Eastern Province, who are extremely fierce. After sunset in Harbin, the whole city closes its doors. It is like walking on thorns. No one dares to step out. However, the Japanese ronin are all familiar with the bandits. Therefore, although the bandits are fierce, the Japanese can play with them in their hands. Otherwise, how could the Japanese be so rampant? In Japan, not only the intellectual class knows the way to love the country, but also the ronin. They are far beyond what the bandits can match. However, the bandits are also very cunning. Last winter, a village was attacked by bandits. The villagers built a fort to defend themselves. The bandits could not succeed. One day, several people came carrying a coffin, seemingly wanting to bury it beside the fort. The villagers came out to stop them, not knowing that they had fallen into their trap. With a loud shout, several people took out guns from the coffin and broke into the fort, and were robbed. It turned out to be the bandits who had failed before. The bandits are good at riding and shooting, and so are the residents. A bandit came out of a house fully loaded with loot. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and three bandits fell to the ground one after another. The remaining bandits did not know where the bullets came from, and scattered like birds and beasts. Only afterwards did they know that the family who had been robbed had a daughter who was only nine years old. Seeing the bandits coming out, she hid behind the window and shot the bandits with a gun. She killed them. Those who heard it admired the little girl's wisdom and courage. The guest also said that the Eastern Province is rich in forests and gold mines, and is indeed a land of abundance. For example, the Yitong River and the Songhua River area have fertile land everywhere, which is suitable for rice, and everything else is suitable for wheat. Is this why the Japanese are so greedy?</p>
<h3>Hot Topics in Cold Records</h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>The scorching sun is rampant. The stifling heat traps people. A guest has just arrived from Hangzhou. His breathing hasn't settled. Sweat pours like ink. He urgently asks for ice cream to relieve the heat. He finishes one cup and asks for more. I smile and say, "Guest, please be patient. Allow me to tell you how to dispel the heat." The guest agrees. So, I turn on an electric fan, prepare melon and fruit, and order a servant to fully open the water tap in the next room. I solemnly tell him, "It's raining." The guest says, "Really? I knew it was going to rain." I say, "Is the heat reduced now?" The guest is leafing through a book on the table. He slowly replies, "The weather is unpredictable. But for the time being, it is much cooler." I clap my hands and stand up, saying, "Indeed! The power of psychology is amazing." Then I tell him that I lied about the rain. The heat and coolness are only due to the change in psychology. The guest is speechless and laughs. I say, "Looking at plums can quench thirst. Can hearing about ice not dispel heat? Let's each tell a cold joke to relieve the heat. What do you think?" The guest nods. I imitate Chunyu's story and say:</p>
<p>Last New Year's Eve, I was traveling in Hangzhou. It was very cold at the time. Snow fell three feet deep. I rode with my girlfriend, Hua Ying, to the western suburbs. Accidentally, we lost control. The horse would not move forward. I hit it with my hand. The horse jumped up. I fell to the ground face-first in the snow. My face was perfectly imprinted. Ying was shocked. She quickly asked if I was hurt. I laughed and said, "No harm done. But this trip is so much fun. It should be recorded. So, I imitated the ancient people's idea of snow mud and swan footprints. I left a shadow in the snow as a souvenir."</p>
<p>After I finished speaking, the guest laughed loudly. When he stopped laughing, he imitated Manqian's story and said, "The winter before last, Hangzhou was very cold. The shallow parts of West Lake were frozen to the bottom. Boats could not move. Residents in the Lakeside Pavilion could not reach the shore for days. They were about to starve. So, an adventurer stepped on the ice to walk. Unexpectedly, before he reached the halfway point, the ice suddenly broke. He fell into the water. Luckily, there were huge ice blocks on both sides, solid and thick. He was submerged to his shoulders. He floated on the surface of the water and did not die. The people on the shore saw it and could not help him. Later, a strong and powerful man threw him a pole. He grabbed the pole with his hand and was pulled up. Afterwards, a joker asked him, 'Was the ice-running game fun?' He laughed and replied, 'Nothing special. I was just imitating Wang Xiang's lying on the ice to seek carp!'"</p>
<p>As soon as the guest finished speaking, laughter filled the room. One person stood up and said, "The guest's story is interesting. Let me try to tell one to add to the fun. What do you think?" Everyone said, "Good." That person said, "One year, it was extremely cold. The temperature dropped below zero. An old-fashioned scholar usually liked to buy Japanese goods and criticized young people's patriotism as unnecessary. That day, he was about to smoke his water pipe. Unexpectedly, the water in the pipe was frozen. He was about to call a servant to change the water. But the saliva on his mouth froze to the pipe and could not be removed. The old-fashioned scholar could not open his mouth. He was extremely embarrassed and cried. As soon as the tears flowed on his face, they froze into ice. Later, someone saw it and pulled it off for him. But with too much force, he lost a tooth. Blood trickled down. In an instant, the blood also turned into ice. One person mocked him and said, 'This is truly a cold-blooded animal!'"</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, the room was noisy. At that time, a cool breeze suddenly arrived. The sweltering heat disappeared. The guest put on his clothes and said goodbye. He said, "Tonight's conversation is much better than eating snow pears and ice lotus roots." I sent the guest back. Then I took up my pen to record it.</p>

<h3>I Will Be a Fish</h3>
<p>— Tianjian</p>
<p>For the past ten days, there have been violent winds and torrential rains. It happens several times a day. The crops north and south of the Yangtze River have been devastated by floods. The decision of the Huai River and the overflow of the Yangtze River, and the farmers who build dikes and die with their bodies, is heard every day. Alas, I will be a fish! I write a song, "I Will Be a Fish." The song says: I will be a fish. Why is Heaven so cruel? The sea is overturned, the earth's axis shifts, and the divine tortoise escapes. Wuzhi breaks the lock, Tian Wu spreads. The demon cloud seems to swallow the red sun. Twenty days of heavy rain and thunder. The white day is dark, like a mute room. The rain flows like ropes and threads. The water floods the flat ground and the ditches are lost. The Huai and Si rivers flow rapidly and break the long dikes. The Yangtze River and the Grand Canal surge with waves. The farmers do not take off their raincoats day and night. Men, women, old, and young are frightened. They build dikes in the middle of the night to defend against Feng Yi. The rain is heavy, the water is fierce, and the effort is difficult. They grab the ground and call to Heaven, but Heaven does not respond. Their bodies are swept away by the waves and disappear. East and west fields are no longer distinguishable. Seventy percent of the fertile land is lost. The Beijing-Shanghai road is flooded and the cars cannot pass. The Tianjin-Pukou road is submerged and also closed. My hometown is low-lying and even more worrying. We only have one harvest after several years. The warehouses and granaries are not yet empty. But how can such a huge disaster be enough to support us? This morning, I suddenly saw the sun shining. But the wind is strong and the rain is heavier at night. The wind is strong and the rain is heavier at night. We cannot avoid becoming fish.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes of India (71)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>I think, can the power of the British defeat the German army but not the unarmed Indians? This is a big question. But I think there are five reasons why Gandhi's methods are partially effective. The first is the national movement. The relationship between England and India is like the relationship between the Manchus and the Han Chinese in the past. Second, India is completely blockaded. There is no way to obtain military equipment. There is no other way but the unarmed movement. Therefore, this emotional hypnosis technique is invented out of desperation. Everything is created by coercion. Third, there are too many Indians and too few British. No matter what, the British cannot kill too many people in such a big country. Fourth, Indian philosophy and culture are high. It is easy to tend towards gentle movements. Fifth, since the Great War, Britain's internal strength has declined. It is not as arrogant as it used to be. With these five reasons, Gandhi's movement should be partially successful. If, as the Indians say, they rely solely on unarmed movements, they can cut off the British military expenditure, give up the government, and give them independence and freedom, like the British did to the United States. I am afraid it will not be easy to do. It is too optimistic. I firmly believe in dynamics. But there has never been such a miracle. Those who overthrow the government with bare hands, I think there will be a day. It will still solve the problem of strength through changes in the army. Gandhi's movement is just the flower. If you want to pick the fruit, you must use arm strength. The hopes of the Indians today, we still cannot fully believe.</p>
<p>A student named Shiridaha is young and good at talking. He said that his ancient civilization was very high. According to the Vedic classics, India had airships and machinery as early as 4000 BC. It was only due to the decline of culture in the middle that the new learning revived today and the ancient learning also revived. In the future, it will definitely be able to dominate the world. Our Indian culture is in the world, not in one country. I couldn't believe it. The Indians could build airships in 4000 BC. But if we compare it with Western history and Chinese books, it is not unreasonable. According to the famous H.G. Wells's The Outline of History, there was a Cretan race before the Greeks, who were a very civilized people. The Greeks once inherited their culture. The Cretans once built airships. It is not without basis. Like the Chinese Gongshuban and Mozi, who both built wooden kites, these are all believable. Because Luban and Mozi are people known to everyone, not mysterious talks. I have traveled to various provinces in China and Southeast Asia. There are Luban temples everywhere. Because of the relationship between craftsmanship, evolution is very large. And today's era of workers, I very much hope that teachers in various parts of China will promote elementary school students to study the Luban Sutra. There are several Luban Sutras. Each bookstore sells them. They are used by carpenters. There are pictures and dimensions. It talks about the method of building wooden utensils and houses. All craftsmen regard it as the Bible. I once looked at it. I didn't pay attention to it at the time. Now I feel its importance. It is the essence of ancient craftsmanship. I am afraid that Chinese workers have too little knowledge. There are places where they have reversed their books. But even small pieces of it are very precious. The word "showing off one's skill before Luban" can spread its culture. The ancient Indian books have the wisdom of craftsmanship. The era of its airship invention is earlier than Greece and China. There may be some truth to it. But Indian mythology is difficult to fully believe. Or it is an ideal. But several students told me solemnly that it was recorded in the classics. It should not be a lie. It is a pity that the good historian H.G. Wells did not hear this. The student also said that the ancient Vedic scriptures are not complete now. It is very difficult to read. Even Indian scholars find it difficult to understand. This student is very erudite. According to others, his father is a famous leader of a political movement. He is very knowledgeable.</p>

<h3>Women Women (6)</h3>
<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>His mother thought that he was complaining about the noodles not being cooked well. She even asked him in a nagging way if he wanted her to buy something outside. Finally, she peeled a few of the bananas that he had brought back for him to eat. She felt that this was very unfair to her son.</p>
<p>She kept nagging and talking to her son, but he didn't really hear a word of it. His wife stood silently to the side, also feeling that she had many important things to say, but regretting that she didn't have the opportunity now.</p>
<p>He finally explained his intention for coming back. His family then realized that he had come back specifically to take money out.</p>
<p>His father, who had been sitting quietly for a long time, suddenly showed the most serious expression. "What should we do? We might be able to figure something out by the time school starts, but why do we have to pay in advance now?" His father said worriedly.</p>
<p>"How much money do you need in total?" His mother also asked helplessly.</p>
<p>"It's not much money, one hundred and sixty yuan is enough." He slightly raised his head that was drooping down and looked at his wife out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>His wife also felt unable to help, and just felt very sorry for him. The room was suddenly filled with a gloomy atmosphere, gradually leading to intermittent sighs.</p>
<p>"How could a family like ours be able to afford to send a son to school? For one person to study, almost three people have to starve to death; in the end, it's all because we've suffered enough from this rickshaw-pulling job, so we foolishly fantasize about saving money and food to let Xiao Rong go to school. But this kind of foreign school, as soon as the holidays are over, demands some kind of fee in advance. Even if we go bankrupt, we won't be able to come up with it!" His father said, almost bursting into tears. He secretly cried out in agony to himself.</p>
<p>His mother couldn't bear to hear it anymore. She seemed to say in a comforting way... "There's no other way! Now that we've embarked on this path, we have to give it a try. It's no wonder that they collect some kind of fee in advance. Think about it, doesn't the county government also collect three years' worth of taxes in advance? Now, we can only discuss a solution properly to let Xiao Rong take it. This is originally the capital we've invested, and we'll always get a whole batch back in the future."</p>
<p>Finally, his wife thought of a way to help out in an emergency. She bravely said... "Father-in-law and mother-in-law, there's no need to worry! I think, as long as Xiao Rong studies hard, he'll always have a chance to make a name for himself in the future. Now, to get one hundred and sixty yuan, let's all pool together what we have! When I married into this family, didn't I still have a pair of gold bracelets? Along with the spare change I've saved from selling flowers, it should add up to more than a hundred yuan. As long as mother-in-law can put her gold jewelry in with it, we'll have the one hundred and sixty yuan."</p>

<h3>Gold Specie Rebounds and Rises</h3>
<p>▲Recovers Four Taels and Nine Mace</p>
<p>▲British Banks Prevent Cash Outflow: Yesterday, the 31st, the gold specie market had already stabilized and the waves were calm. The daily fluctuation was only six taels and five mace. It revolved around 740 taels. As a result, it rebounded by five taels. Although there was not much trading among colleagues, the cash flow was different. People's hearts are still firm. The silver market has indeed risen. It is said that the British banking community will increase interest rates to prevent cash outflow. The foreign exchange rate is stable, but there are hidden changes in the future. Later, the market turned from stable to strong, and the exchange rate rose sharply. Afterwards, it broke through 43 taels. The buying interest was even stronger. It is expected that the large bars will fall back this morning.</p>
<p>▲Large Bars Rise After Initial Decline: The opening price in the early morning of September increased by one and a half taels, to 740 taels. The premium for large bars was an eighth. The public and private telegraph prices of silver both increased by a quarter, but it was not moved. Soon, Tongtai, Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, Shunli and others all sold out. It immediately fell by two or three taels, to 37 taels and two mace. Suddenly, it was heard that the bank ate 1875 British gold, and it rose again to 39 taels and four mace. When the shilling opened, it was 39 taels, and the listed price did not change. However, the East Ocean small went down by two five, but at this time Hongli, Jinan, etc. bought in, and it rose to 41 taels and two mace. Later, because HSBC sold 1875 British gold, and Yuancheng Yong, Qianchangxiang, Fuyu, etc. also sold, the price fell by three taels and several mace to 37 taels and a half at 10:30. It was dragged in again by Yuanxing Yong, Zhifeng Yong, etc., and raised by two taels. After 11:00, it was 39 taels and four mace. Then, because the Indian exchange rate for the forward report was one anna higher, and the recent rate did not move, it was sold by retail customers, so it dropped by one tael. After 11:30, it was 38 taels and two or three mace. At this moment, Cuichang Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, etc. came in, and it rose by more than one tael again. At noon, it was 39 taels and nine mace. In a short while, it fell by six or seven mace. At noon, it closed at 39 taels and a half. The price was changed to 790 taels and two mace, a discount of 50 taels.</p>
<p>▲Gradual Rise Due to More Buyers: The market opened at 40 taels in the afternoon, followed by 39 taels and three mace, because retail customers were selling. And because the British gold was still settled at 1875, it began to rise at 2:30. The buyers on the surface gradually developed. Colleagues always had to clear British gold. Maihang, Mitsui, Toa, etc. issued September 125. Then the bank asked for 0625. Yongfeng, Zhifeng Yong, Fuyu, etc. agreed to buy bars. It was also heard that a large batch of silver would arrive in Shanghai from abroad. People's hearts were shaken, and it suddenly rose by three taels and several mace. At 3:00, it was 43 taels and seven mace. I heard that HSBC bought 125 British gold. It seemed like a blow to the head. It fell back by two taels, to 41 taels and a half. The atmosphere was peaceful afterwards, with a slight increase of two taels. At almost 4:00, the bank did 125. And the buyers seemed diligent. Soon, the recent British gold was only settled at 0625. The forward rate may be 125. The gold price continued to increase by one tael, to 43 taels and a half. At 4:30, the closing price was 43 taels and four mace, an increase of four taels and nine mace compared with the 30th. This is a rebound after three days of consecutive declines. According to the day's maximum price of 43 taels and seven mace and the minimum price of 37 taels and two mace, the difference is six taels and five mace.</p>
<p>▲Current Red Price Increases by Eleven Taels: The morning price of goods was 39 taels and eight mace, 9 taels and a half at noon, and 9 taels and seven mace in the afternoon.

<p>▲The Rest Also Rise by One to One and a Half Yuan</p>

Therefore, only the August period was sold yesterday. However, due to the sharp changes in bond prices, the market in and out was very active. The atmosphere was very lively. It is estimated that the turnover of the two sessions in the morning reached 1.1 million. There were also more than 500,000 in the afternoon session. Speaking of the changes in each bond, it was weak in the early morning and fell more than before the settlement. Due to the news of a turnaround in the situation, the market was optimistic. Buying transactions were very strong. The bond price also increased due to demand exceeding supply. For example, the 20-year customs bonds, unified tax and various treasury bonds, both reached more than two yuan in the morning opening and closing sessions. Although the afternoon session continued to rise, the trend has greatly slowed down. As a result, compared with Tuesday, such as the 20-year customs bonds, it rose by two yuan and four jiao and a half. Other also rebounded by seven or eight jiao to one yuan, five or six jiao.

<h3>Yarn and Cloth Market</h3>
<h3>Yarn Market in a Panic to Sell</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending downwards, and the situation is very weak. This is because part of the Factory Law can be temporarily delayed, and the situation in the north is unstable. Imported cotton is declining step by step, causing a lack of confidence. Many investors are inclined to sell, while a certain short seller has no intention of covering, adding to their positions on every rise. In addition, the slump in raw cotton prices is raging, affecting the yarn market. As for current yarn sales, they are still considered good, but Japanese merchants are very active, and it is said that domestic traders have absorbed about 1,000 bales.</p>
<p>▲People's Standard Declines by One or Two Taels</p>
<p>At the opening of the pre-market trading session on the exchange, the People's Standard cotton price was weak due to the sluggish US cotton market. Market sentiment was particularly weak, and bearish sentiment was strong. Prices fell by 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 mace (tenths of a tael). The afternoon was flat, and far-month contracts rose slightly by 0.24 mace. A total of 29,500 bales were traded. Dafu bought 1,900 bales, Ruidahua 1,550 bales, and Changfeng 1,050 bales. Taixing bought 1,450 bales, Heshen 1,600 bales, Rongxing 850 bales, and Yichang 2,050 bales. The closing prices of the People's Standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>▲Current Sales Still Considered Good</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are still good. Statistics show that various domestic traders bought a total of 1,150 bales throughout the day, while fellow traders bought 200 bales. Domestic traders bought 1,000 bales of futures. Market conditions were flat. Traders from Sichuan bought 125 bales, Hankou 55 bales, Dalian 100 bales, Tianjin 155 bales, Shantou 75 bales, Yunnan 240 bales, and miscellaneous traders 250 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Continue to Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>The decline in cotton prices is intensifying, due to the pessimistic outlook for the global cotton industry. Private estimates suggest that the new US cotton crop will reach 14 million bales. The local weather in Shanghai has been sunny, which has had a significant impact. The pressure from buyers is increasing, causing further anxiety. There are rumors that some merchants are selling off large quantities of cotton, making it difficult to stabilize the market. The future direction depends on the US and Indian cotton markets, as well as exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Plummets by Eight Mace</p>
<p>At the opening of the pre-market trading session on the Exchange, the Hankou Standard cotton price situation was becoming increasingly weak, and the decline intensified. Prices fell by 0.6 to 0.7 mace in each month. In the afternoon, prices fluctuated by 0.05 to 0.1 mace in each month. A total of 141,500 dan (a unit of weight) were traded throughout the day. Dafu sold 4,700 dan, Jifeng 3,600 dan, Gongtai 2,000 dan, Tongyu 2,700 dan, Changfeng 3,600 dan, and Xincheng 4,200 dan.

<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Market is Mediocre</h3>
<p>▲US Cotton is Uncertain</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was waiting for the next government report. The market was uncertain. It was initially weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, but then strengthened due to short covering. Futures prices rose by 2 to 3 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. UK cotton futures rose by 1 to 2 points, and spot prices fell by 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was calm and strong. Pingle and Oumura rose by 1.25 rupees, and Bailuo Creek rose by 0.5 rupees. The original telegrams are recorded on the left (dated July 30).</p>

The Naughton Company estimates that this year's production will be 70.6% of the normal annual production. The previous estimate (July 1) was 69.6% of the normal annual production.</p>
<p>Grains and Rice Market: Riverbank Rice Market Becomes Quiet and Active</p>
<p>▲South Market</p>
<p>Yesterday's supplies from various traders in the South Market were scarce, and inventory was also low. Today's decline may bring changes. The previous market slump and the continued price increases for imported rice by traders from other regions have slightly increased investor interest. However, transactions are only slightly more active, and this situation has led to a stable and rising market. As a result, the price of thick japonica rice has rebounded by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan (dollars), and medium-quality rice has risen slightly. The floods in the Yangtze River region will undoubtedly affect incoming ships. High-quality Lu Yang and Tip Rice are scarce, and prices have risen by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. Second-grade rice is not coveted, and the market is tight. Glutinous rice has weakened, and sales are slow. The market is stable. Traders are still unable to obtain imported rice in sufficient quantities.</p>
<p>▲Xinzha</p>
<p>The rice market shows no signs of recovery, as there are still river stocks available, but supplies are extremely scarce towards the end of the lunar month. Firms are routinely closing their accounts, so the market is not very active. Prices for various types of rice have limited fluctuations. The prices of thick japonica and thin indica rice have risen by 0.03 yuan, while early rice is unpopular, and prices are stable. Lu Yang and Tip Rice continue to sell well in the local area, and the market is gradually tightening. River factory goods are being opened at prices of 2,000 to 3,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Record of Flour and Wheat Deliveries in July</h3>
<p>▲Only 7,000 Bags of Flour Delivered</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for July flour contracts. It is reported that the total number of bags delivered throughout the day was only 7,000, including 4,000 bags of Fufeng's Red and Blue Car brands, 1,000 bags of Xinda's Green Cannon Tower brand, and 2,000 bags of Huafeng's Green Wheat Root brand. Because the factories were either milling outside or pre-packaging for traders, the volume was very low. Futures trading remained brisk, with a total volume of 21,314,000 bags for the entire month, itemized below: (Unit: 1,000 bags)</p>
<p>July 2,667    August 3,359</p>
<p>September 4,337 October 4,334</p>
<p>November 3,912 December 2,605</p>
<p>▲52 Carloads of Wheat Delivered</p>
<p>All July wheat contracts were settled yesterday, totaling 52 carloads. It is reported that Runde delivered 13 carloads, Yutai 5 carloads, and Dingtai 12 carloads. The rest were delivered by various small traders. The recipients were also traders, with Tairun receiving 30 carloads and Xinfeng over 10 carloads. The rest were small traders. After the floodwaters recede in various places, there will be no shortage of goods in Shanghai. Imported wheat has also been trading briskly recently. Yesterday, two factories ordered three ships of Australian wheat at a combined price of only 4.23 taels per unit.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Market: French Firms Replenish Stocks of Dried Filature Silk Due to Shortages</p>
<p>The silk market in Shanghai remained sluggish yesterday. There was no change in the overseas telegrams for yellow and white filature silk, and foreign exchange rates were stable. Only French firms replenished their stocks of dried filature silk, with Dachang and others importing 25 bales of Qili dried filature silk, and prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Scarcity of Wuxi White Filature Silk Shipments to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday (July 31) was the final delivery day for July foreign firm futures silk contracts. Sales of white filature silk to the United States have been stagnant for a long time, and the number of sales to England and France is also very limited. Most firms require spot goods. As a result, the delivery volume of white filature silk futures for this month has been very low. The amount of silk shipped to Shanghai from Wuxi factories is very small. As of yesterday, the total amount of silk shipped to Shanghai from Wuxi factories was only around 200 bales.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Orchid and Bamboo Branch Land Prices Rise by Seven Yuan</p>
<p>▲Dark Leaf Branches Rise by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The price of orchid and bamboo branches has risen by another six or seven yuan, and dark leaf branches have risen by ten yuan. The supply is becoming increasingly scarce. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau's "Tunan" ship arrived with over 500 boxes, of which over 100 boxes were for transshipment. Therefore, only over 400 boxes were available in Shanghai. The price of the land, combined, requires 56 taels per box, so quotations are bound to increase further. Quanyuan red branches also arrived yesterday and were immediately offered for sale at a price of around 65 taels. The trend is stable and bullish.</p>
<p>Hardware: UK and US Plain Galvanized Iron Sales Advance Sharply</p>
<p>▲Market Overview</p>
<p>Yesterday's hardware transactions were good for traders from Yantai and Tianjin in the north, and procurement was also extensive in the Yangtze River region, so the trend was good. However, after the boycott, sales of UK and US plain galvanized iron have been very strong. Japanese goods can only be sold at retail in stores, and export prospects can be said to be completely cut off.</p>
<p>UK Galvanized Iron Inventory Emptied</p>
<p>Due to strong demand, the market inventory of UK galvanized iron, which had been stocked for many days, was emptied. Market conditions are very strong. 48-sheet iron is selling for 16.5 taels, 38-sheet iron for 16.75 taels, 33-sheet iron for 15.8 taels, and 25-sheet iron for 15.25 taels. It is reported that over 600-700 dan were sold in the market yesterday.</p>
<p>▲US Galvanized Iron Trend Improving</p>
<p>The US galvanized iron trade has also shown signs of improvement recently. Although there is no immediate prospect of a boom in the standard product, it is already higher than before by more than a few cents. 48-sheet iron is selling for 19.25 taels, 38-sheet iron for 19.5 taels, 33-sheet iron for 18.75 taels, and 25-sheet iron for 17.9 taels.</p>
<p>▲UK Steel Plate Trend Stronger</p>
<p>Traders from Niuzhuang, Dalian, and Tianjin bought UK steel plates yesterday, and the market outlook is optimistic. Because various traders are actively buying, there is no fear of oversupply, but the market is good, so there have been no announcements of price increases.</p>

<h3>Third-Class VIPs and Others</h3>
<p>— Dou Mei</p>
<p>The last two days have been beyond my wildest dreams. Unconsciously, I have become a VIP. I have traveled between Shanghai and Hangzhou four times. However, this VIP of mine is, after all, a bit different from the ordinary so-called VIPs. The ordinary so-called VIPs, at the very least, travel in first-class cars or sleeper cars or special cars, while this VIP of mine only travels in third class. Well, then I might as well give myself a title: "A third-class VIP." Furthermore, if we talk about the essence of a VIP, the reason why a VIP is called a VIP is that what he travels for and engages in are important matters. What I did, however, was something like a tea errand. What's so important about that? But stepping back, if this matter could only be done by me, then I am clearly a VIP again. So, looking at it this way, I still don't lose my status as a VIP, only I can't get rid of a prefix — "third-class."</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I was asked by a person who has several relationships with us — relative, fellow villager, classmate of my younger brother, and also his friend — Mr. Ding, to register for Zhejiang University. Originally, registration could be done by mail in Shanghai, but this rule had been discontinued the day before — the 14th. Therefore, I had to "eat dragon meat and personally go into the sea." If Mr. Ding really had to register in person, then on the one hand, he would need to prepare his lessons and couldn't run around at will; on the other hand, he wasn't very familiar with traveling. In this way, it seemed that only I could fulfill this obligation. Asking someone else, in this hot weather, who would be happy to take on this errand? So, without waiting for Mr. Ding to open his mouth, I boldly volunteered.</p>
<p>I planned to take the 7:10 train. At 6:20, I stood at the bus stop waiting for the bus. Who knew that more than five buses passed by, but none of them went to the North Station? This really made me anxious. At this time, it was absolutely too late to call a rickshaw, because the first train arrived at 1:00. I wanted to catch the 2:00 train back that day. If I had to sacrifice this train, I would really be unwilling in my heart. My eyes were anxiously looking north, and the police officer next to the station (because I met him every time I waited for the bus, he seemed to be an acquaintance already) kept telling me what time it was, which made me even more anxious. Finally, I didn't miss the train and arrived at the North Station with ten minutes to spare. The whole way really made me angry. The carriage was packed with people. I don't know how I carelessly sat next to a woman who had three children. On the right was a burly man with a northern appearance. Of course, it was inconvenient for me to squeeze in that direction. My body was always leaning to the left, but that woman was clearly unhappy and deliberately squeezed towards me, intending to push me out. But I guessed her intention and deliberately didn't adjust my position. However, I suffered enough from the troubles of those three children, who were climbing up and down all the time, eating this and that. The woman was traveling with seven or eight other people in a row, both men and women, young and old. From their clothes, actions, and conversation, I concluded that they were not upper-class people. Later, the woman simply took off her coat and wore only a small, buttoned shirt, busy playing with the children and constantly stuffing melons, eggs, bread, etc. into her mouth. Another man traveling with them always wore a ferocious and hateful smile, constantly praising the current material civilization.</p>
<p>"It's really funny. People nowadays are simply living gods, able to soar through the clouds and ride the fog. In the morning, they are in Shanghai, and immediately they can be in Hangzhou. Damn it, as long as you have money. Also, it's easy to fight wars now. Transporting guns and troops, wow, you can travel hundreds of miles a day..."</p>
<p>Beginning with "damn it" and ending with "wow," he spoke with great satisfaction and relish. The other few were smoking cigarettes, eating melon seeds, and listening attentively, gradually nodding to express their admiration for the argument he had made.</p>
<p>How pitiful, ah, China's material civilization. Where is it? Apart from these few railways and navigable waterways, most of the rest is still mules, oxcarts, and single-wheeled human-powered vehicles on land, and sailing ships powered by manpower on waterways. Of course, they don't know how convenient the material civilization and transportation of European and American countries are. But they also live in the same place as us, and only a slight difference in the level of knowledge has made them complete frogs in a well. At that time, I didn't find their stupid words laughable, but instead, I felt an infinite sense of nameless emotion and shock. At the same time, I thought of the cliché "contentment brings happiness." They have already expressed great satisfaction with China's material life, so he has the above praise.</p>
<p>After registering, I barely made it to the station, but the 2:08 train had already left without me. I felt very disappointed. If I missed this train, I wouldn't have another one until 6:00. How would I spend these four hours? I was only discussing in my mind: "Oh, didn't Mom tell me a long time ago, 'Hangzhou baskets are good. Buy me two covered, tightly woven baskets to hold water chestnuts, etc. They dry well and won't rot, and mice can't get to them.'" Ah, Mom's kind instructions immediately reappeared in my mind, so I made up my mind. First, I would go to a restaurant to eat, and then hire a car to sit in Lakeside Park for a while.</p>
<p>"From another place."</p>
<p>"Imported goods."</p>
<p>"Not local."</p>
<p>"Outsider."</p>
<p>Sitting in Lakeside Park for less than a quarter of an hour, waves of those shady men walked past me in groups of threes and fives, muttering to themselves. You say they are hooligans, I wouldn't dare to say for sure. If they aren't, why are they so bored? The women who passed by didn't grumble anything, but they also put on a fascinated look to stare at me. The vendors all came to compete and ask me to buy things. As a result, I became annoyed. They seemed to see that I was unfamiliar and deliberately came to bully me. I had no choice but to say goodbye to that lovely West Lake girl earlier.</p>
<p>The baskets were bought, and the clock told me it was only 4:30. If I went to the station now, I would be laughed at. So I went to buy an umbrella, deliberately bargaining with the old man and talking nonsense in order to delay some time. As a result, I didn't spend a penny. Indeed, my mind was not on the wine. Fortunately, it wasn't a busy street, and with the shop owner's permission, I simply sat there and read the recent short story monthly.</p>
<p>What a blessed appearance, truly worthy of being the wife of a VIP. I couldn't help but secretly praise her.</p>
<p>A large line of police officers was displayed in the station like a meat screen. The captain (?) issued very solemn and heavy commands from time to time, and the police officers followed the commands to stand at attention to the left and right. I couldn't guess why they were doing this. Suddenly, the captain's command became even louder, and the police officers followed the command and stood up straight, focusing their minds. Then two guards protected a group of people who came out, all of whom were neatly dressed — to put it neurotically, their appearance also seemed neat. Among them, there was only one female guest. This female guest was extremely plump. On her white lotus-like arm, she wore a jade bracelet with a round inside and a square outside. Of course, it was the focus of our attention. At this time, the eyes of all the passengers waiting in the station were focused on that group of neat people, especially the lady. Needless to say, this was the departure of a certain VIP. From clusters of whispers, I learned that the VIP was Jiang Zuobin, and the lady was of course his wife. However, the lady's blessed appearance still remains in my mind, leaving a deep sketch.</p>
<p>The next morning, my younger brother came to my dormitory to discuss with me. Another person whose relationship with us was no less than that of Mr. Ding also wanted to apply to Zhejiang University, but I had to go to register them again. Although my younger brother was afraid that I would be overworked, I could not refuse the request, and I finally agreed. This is what made me this VIP.</p>
<p>"They came from Shanghai on the early train for two days in a row," I walked into the school's registration office, and the staff was whispering like this. After hearing this, I really didn't know what to think. The 2:00 train had obviously passed, so I got the consent of a teacher at the school and took out the work I had planned to do — to write a manuscript of random notes — in a corner of the office.</p>
<p>When I got back to the station, I couldn't see the police officers' meat screen anymore. However, the scene in front of the station last night immediately floated into my mind again, reminding me that it was the departure of a VIP.</p>

<h3>The World's Largest Post Office</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>Will Be Built in Chicago</p>
<p>The world's largest post office will be built in Chicago, USA. The building will occupy 50 acres, that is, more than 300 Chinese acres. It will be twelve stories high and will be completed within a year and a half. Its internal facilities can process 19 million letters and newspaper packages a day, not included. According to statistics, the size of the mail it handles in a year is just as big as the building.</p>
<p>Judging from its equipment, it is more appropriate to say that it is a factory than a post office. Every minute, cars collecting letters from various mailboxes come in. The collected letters are immediately sent to the top floor by elevator. By the time it falls to the lower floor, it has already been stamped, sorted, packed, and prepared to be sent out.</p>
<p>The internal machinery is all the latest type. Except for the parts that require the use of the brain, it is entirely machine work.</p>
<h3>Female Leader in San Francisco's Printing Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yuxiang</p>
<p>An American Woman of Business Talent, Who Struggled from Nothing to Her Current Position</p>
<p>When Mrs. Mary Macken was forcibly dismissed by her employer, looking back on her nineteen years of arduous service, all her efforts seemed to vanish like flowing water, and her heart was filled with depression and nowhere to vent. What a painful and pitiful situation! However, now she is immersed in happiness every day, because today she has become a leading figure in the San Francisco printing industry, and has independently established a large-scale printing company. Her struggle for success is glorious and valuable, and extremely worthy of boasting to others. In San Francisco, Mrs. Mary Macken is practically the first woman to use her own private funds to run a large business, and not inherit it from her father, husband, or brothers.</p>
<p>It was twenty-four years ago when a young woman traveled a long distance from Meien, Poland, to California in the United States to seek her fortune. At that time, her only commercial experience was sitting at home, writing advertising copy and drawing pictures. In a city as large as San Francisco, Mrs. Mary Macken was very poor and had no acquaintances. Fortunately, she soon found a printing company near her residence, and then applied for a small position in that company. At that time, the salary was six US dollars per week.</p>
<p>Years passed like flowing water. Mrs. Mary Macken had become an American citizen. Her salary also gradually and steadily increased. Finally, in addition to her regular salary, the company also gave her an extra allowance each year.</p>
<p>At the same time, she was also elected as the first female member of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, receiving a generous monthly public fee. In this way, her income increased a lot, and it could be compared to the huge amount that any American woman could earn. However, the manager of the company gradually became jealous of her and soon dismissed her ruthlessly, even though she had a remarkable record of nineteen years there.</p>
<p>In extreme grief and resentment, Mrs. Mary Macken forced herself to pull herself together. She resolutely gathered her past savings and planned to start her own printing company. She purchased a large three-story building as the factory site. The printing machines were all the latest models, and all other equipment was also exceptionally perfect. A sign was hung outside the door that read, "Mary Macken Printing Company."</p>
<p>Due to her profound reputation and rich experience in the printing industry over the past nineteen years, coupled with a very agile skill, the business of Macken Printing Company had reached an extremely developed stage in just five years. The various businesses accepted daily, from business cards and movie brochures to hardcover books, were all-encompassing. Therefore, today in the United States, when people talk about the printing industry in San Francisco, no one does not know Mrs. Mary Macken, and in fact, she is indeed a female leader in the San Francisco printing industry.</p>
<p>In the midst of her busy schedule, in addition to striving to develop the company's business, she also took time to devote herself to social undertakings. Today, there is a vast prairie at the foot of the Sea Cliff Mountains in the suburbs of San Francisco, which is specially used as a camping site for children in the city during the holidays. Although it is nominally a municipal public property, in fact, several years ago, Mrs. Mary Macken funded the purchase of the land, developed it, and then donated it as municipal property. This is her contribution to the entertainment of children in the city.</p>
<p>In addition, she is also the Minister of the California Business and Professional Women's Club. At the same time, she also holds extremely important positions in the Women's Suffrage League and the National Women's Federation. Not many years ago, the American Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) specially sent her to China to conduct a social survey. She obtained a lot of new information about the current situation of Chinese women and children, which she contributed to her own country.</p>

<h3>Practical Bank Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Ling Feng</p>
<p>Written by Hu Zhifan</p>
<p>Correspondence is a specialized skill in literature, and commercial correspondence is even more unique in style. Even talented and unrestrained writers may feel unable to write a simple letter for a shop. As for bank correspondence, it is even more absolutely specialized. There are many terms used in bank business that are not understandable to outsiders.</p>
<p>In the Chinese publishing industry, apart from the Qiushui Xuan Correspondence, which is for private use, there are very few books on commercial correspondence. The reason for this is that Chinese businessmen only feel that writing letters is a troublesome and unimportant matter. They cherish ink like gold and are reluctant to write easily unless absolutely necessary. They do not understand that commercial letters, in addition to their mission of conveying facts, can also attract many unfamiliar customers in the world. Therefore, the correspondence departments in stores in Europe and the United States occupy a very important position in the entire store. They do not have to meet the customer in person, and a piece of paper with eight lines is enough to entice buyers to appreciate their goods.</p>
<p>They understand the importance of doing business by mail (Doing Business By Mail), so they strive to study the organization of commercial correspondence, how to make it simple and clear, and not to bore customers with endless chatter, while at the same time writing it with strength and interest. To meet this need, commercial correspondence publications have sprung up and become an important course in business schools.</p>
<p>However, those are all ordinary commercial letters, only suitable for department stores. There is still nothing specifically about banking business. The author of this book, in view of the development of Chinese banks and the urgent need for such works, based on his experience, wrote this book. It contains one hundred simple and fluent English letters. All the letters that occur in daily banking business can be considered to be fully prepared. Among them, deposits, pledges, import and export, telegraphic transfers, etc., are classified into categories, and each letter is practical and can be used as a blueprint for bankers. It is also a must-read book for commercial students studying banking. Taking advantage of the book's reprint, I am specially introducing it in a few words. Sales agencies: Commercial Press, Qunyi Bookstore, Civilization Bookstore, etc. in various ports.</p>
<h3>Guidelines for Book and Newspaper Introduction Manuscripts</h3>
<p>(1) The text is limited to introducing the latest domestic and foreign publications. In addition to literary works, all political, economic, legal, scientific, educational... and other books and newspapers are included in the introduction, but books and newspapers with no connection will not be introduced.</p>
<p>(2) For books, only recent works by new domestic and foreign authors and attachments related to the text are allowed.</p>
<p>(3) Articles on textual research or research on ancient Chinese books will not be published.</p>
<p>(4) Pictures and photographs are limited to those related to the text.</p>
<p>(5) Each article should not exceed 3,000 words.</p>
<p>(6) Do not write on both sides of the manuscript paper.</p>
