<h3>德國左右派之影片爭</h3>
<p>世界各國之政黨。苟其主張相反者。則無論保事。皆可借攻訏之具無論何種細徵之事。皆可以報復之手段出之。其目的旣在攻訏。手段旣在報復。則必不暇問及其事之關於國家利害如何。影響於社會安危如何。故政爭一啓。遂無寗息之日。其可危爲何如也。如今日柏林電謂。左派各黨。在影戲院反對開映普王大腓特利克歷史影片。幾釀大暴動。經大隊察示威驅散。至探究左派各黨所以反對此影片之故。則因憤恨國家社會黨之阻撓開映西線無戰事影片之故。遂指此影片爲鼓吹帝制思想。反對和平主義。以報復之耳。夫國家社會黨之反對西線無戰事。本屬借題發揮今左派各黨之反對大腓特利克影片。又因國家社會黨之發揮而發揮之。此種極細微之事用心尙且如是。則凡較有關係之問題可藉口以相攻擊者。更不知其如何景象矣此政爭之所以可慮也。雖然。凡爲人類。無不有爭勝於人與不甘受屈於人之心。故世界無論何種社會。莫不以報復爲處世應有之手段。大之至於驚天動地之戰事。亦無不由此而起。豈僅政黨如是哉。</p>

<h3>中國科學社爲靑島觀象台日員案宣言</h3>
<p>中國科學社爲靑島觀象台日員懸案事敬告政府當局及國内各學術團體文云、同人等、自民國十一年、日人交還靑島、即知有所謂靑島觀象台者、又知當時外交當局交涉未能澈底、尙有一部分客卿式之日員留台、惟該台所辦之事業、外間知者尙少、十五年國際間、有經度測量之舉、靑島觀象台亦參預是項工作、十七年、中華敎育文化基金會、亦補助該台二萬五千元、以爲購置赤道儀器之用、更約略知該台、台務進行之梗槪、洎去年八月、本社社員蒞靑島開第十五次年會、因該台爲靑埠最早之科學機關爰往參觀、並詳細調查其内容、始知該台所辦學術事業、爲天文氣象·海洋·地磁地·震·五者、天文科之主要項目、爲中星觀測、日斑觀測地方授時、無線電信號授時、及編制節候表等、氣象部分、採用二十四小時觀測制、按日發行天氣圖、作天氣預報、及對於航海船舶報告極東方面高低氣壓中心之位置等、海洋則除海洋氣象外、更採取海產動植礦物等、地磁力而有絕對觀測、及自記儀觀測二種、地震置有維開爾氏製之水平地震儀舉凡比年來、日本及中國内部之地震、均有紀錄、綜覽是等成績、均足使各人满意、至於日員懸案、據蔣台長報告之大意、則謂當魯案開始時、日人則倡言、中國無測候人材、須保留靑島測候所、旋經交涉始允交還、當時訂有協定兩條、</p>
<p>（甲）暫時日本職員不受中國報酬、爲中國測候所之經營維持照舊職務、該測候所與日本測候所交換之電報、中國政府務與以方便、</p>
<p>（乙）將來中國測候所職員養成後、與舊職員交代時、更定與日本測候所報告聯絡辦法、</p>
<p>條文雖如是、實際上中國職員、自該台成立以來、均係自謀發展、蓋此種測候職務、中國人本無待乎日本之代爲經營維持也、民國十三年、留台日本高級員、入間田毅、曾遞意見書、内有中國已有是項技術人員、應將靑島測候所之業務、全部交回中國技術員管理、前此所開、關於靑島測候所之協定辦法、應暫廢止等語、是時日本職員已準備交代、適値國内第二次奉直戰爭、外部無人負責、遂無形擱置十七年三月、奉到商埠局令、關亽觀象台中日職員懸案、經外部切催日使後、日使已有商議交代之表示云云、正擬乘此解决、復因魯省戰事影響、仍不蜾行、爾後屢經交涉、終不得要領、最近且牽涉協定以外事項、隱然有爲我國學術界代表之語氣、其要求外交部之條文中、有氣象地震天文等、均可交還中國職員辦理、惟地磁氣一項、因中國未加入國際地磁學協會、日本代表東亞、應留日員在台觀測地磁氣等語、此類要求、旣逸出協定範圍、尤難忍受、</p>
<p>該此懸案一日不解决、其爲我國學術界之恥辱、莫此爲甚焉、同人根據以上事實、並參以目觀之成績、爰知此懸案有從速解决之必要、蓋學術雖不限國界、然各國均以科學獨立、爲增進國際地位之目標、日本近來各科著述、均用本國文字出版、以達此目標、獨於同文同種之鄰國、反思　俎代庖、在國際上、爲不名譽、且日人年費如許巨欵、在靑島設此疊牀架星之畸形測候機關、在科學上、亦爲不經濟、乃日人明知之、而悍然爲之、可知其用心之别有所在、大抵帝國主義者之文化侵略、較諸經濟侵略、其手段爲尤酷、故本社此次、特爲靑島觀象台、鄭重臺明、敬請政府當局、予以深切之注意、國内各學術團體、起爲共同之援助、俾解除此類不平等協定、而使科學獨立、是即同人惟一之主旨、</p>

<p>結婚。好像是一個銀行。你樂或悲哀。都是你年己放進去的。</p>
<p>男子們口頭的允諾。像報紙上所刋載的氣象報告一樣。决不能眞正的加以信託。然而女子們爲希望心所驅。常不憚於要求男子們爲某種口頭的允諾</p>
<p>當一對新結婚的男女。開始在討論他們因結婚而自顧放棄的一切利益時。他們就已有離婚的可能了。</p>
<p>當一個男子已想到「戀愛之中必有痛苦」的結論時。他一定已竟達到了哲學的年齡。換句話說。就是已達到了行將就木之年。</p>
<p>戀愛之中必有痛苦。喝酒之後必須頭痛。與購買快樂必須有相當的代價。都是千古不移的確論。</p>
<p>不要把你的秘密告訴了你的女人而呌伊嚴守勿洩。因爲伊自己出有秘密。决不能一心兩用。把你的秘密格外嚴守。</p>

<p>一個男子。可以失去了他的頭髮。他的金錢。他的記憶。以及其他一切所有之物。可是他幼年所得的綽號。却會永久留存。而不致消滅。</p>
<p>男子們於晚年結婚時所感覺的痛苦就是這樣丨比他年長的女子。已激不起他的心弦，比他年幼的女子呢。好雖好。可是女子却看不起他。</p>
<h3>吳門趣掌故</h3>
<p>飯牛翁</p>
<p>彭狀元吃官司蘇城四大家。彭宋潘韓。彭爲首屈一指者。因祖孫會狀也。彭定求會元狀元。子一瓏舉孝廉。孫啓豐亦拔會狀。世論榮之。當啓豐少年未第居鄕時。曾爲友人作賣田中保。迨五十年後。啓豐由尙書大學士乞休。在家食一品俸。而昔時田契忽起糾葛。致兩造人訟。追源當日中保甲乙。須對簿公庭作證。吳縣知縣官。見訴狀原中係彭啓豐。不知彭啓豐爲告老之狀元宰相。立出傳票拘提。彭即於票尾題詩一絕句云。自笑當年彭啓豐。賣田代友作原中。姓名御筆親題後。今見琴堂一點紅。差役持傳票復命。縣官驚駭欲痴。急屏騶從。造府請罪。彭一笑置之。並囑秉公照辦。至今吳人猶傳誦焉。</p>
<p>戚子卿讀書樓盲詞小說有雙金錠。爲明代故事。中載蘇城告狀一節。請因果巷訟師戚子卿寫稿云云。戚子卿實有其其人。爲吳縣巨富。早年入泮作弟子員。住因果巷。家有藏書處。題榜曰鴛鴦樓。牙筌玉軸。位置清幽。（見兪曲園居士筆記）與雙金錠盲詞唱句不符。至清代其藏書處即爲長洲進士顧俠君（嗣立）秀野草堂五百梅花庵故址。左鄰有妙嚴公主墓。至今一塊香土猶存。而梅花庵。鴛鴦樓。荒烟薄霧矣。名士不及美人。爲之一歎。</p>
<h3>模範商人</h3>
<p>超天</p>
<p>長沙劉海樓先生。幼甚頴悟。惜限於家境。輟學甚早。從友人宧游蘇皖。其過程之艱苦。非筆墨所能形容。而其堅忍進取之精神。頗可爲讀者一道也。</p>
<p>劉君自知失學之苦。輒於公餘之暇。發憤讀書。且每於晨昏寫字繪畫。至今數十年。無日間斷。故所作極工。亦多以贈於友好。後以洞悉官塲中之齷齪。改事工商。於開封南關。設大中火柴公司。大生肥皂工廠。慘淡經營。煞費心力。因而資本雄厚。規模日宏。河南工商界中。獨爲泰斗。蓋其所以見重於人者。厥爲篤守信義也。河南兵燹無已。財力已窮。當局每有請爲佐理政務者。輒堅辭不就。但兩湖同鄕會會長。河南省商會會長。事屬義務性質。又以公共利益爲前提。雖棘手之處甚多。然亦樂爲其難。不辭勞瘁。尤以應付艱鉅之得法。辦事之勤廉。故河南商會長一席。幾有非君莫屬之勢。而同鄕中叨惠者。固不止少數人已也。現其年已老而身尙健。回憶湘水嶽雲。頗有南歸之意。惟常告人曰。我師則公司停頓。數千工人將陷於絕境。不如打消個人之成見。而謀大多數人之安全爲善。因此益勵前操。更從事於墾殖籌振等事業。常觀其卓立於戰雲密佈中。而著績斐然。洵足爲人所稱道。而不能不佩服者也。</p>
<h3>記賣女異人</h3>
<p>乙乙廬主</p>
<p>余友徐君。自海寗回。途遇一老人。似賣解者。挈一女。十齡許耳。老人告衆。婢子年漸長。欲貨之以免牽帥。疇能不吝一金値。而抱之起者。挈去可耳。脫不能起。則一金者。須爲老人資斧。觀者雖衆。莫敢試。有屠戶某。膂力過甚。羣慫恿之。謂娶作子婦。良佳。屠喜。揎臂出袖。自後抱其腰。竟不能起。時女兩手按膝。蹲地而已。衆驚喜。鼓掌。屠大慚。赤面頳頸。酬値而去。事後告人。女兩足如有根柢。不能動分毫。不知是何神力也。此徐君當日所目覩。爲我歷歷言之。</p>
<p>蒙按古今之類於此者。非止一端。某說部。刻不能舉其名。曾載有父女兩人賣藝。父老矣。女可二十許人。均嫻刀馬。並能於繩索上來往如飛。尤異者。則張繩於河上。父舞刀行繩上。女擔水而逆之。比相及。女倒懸以過。迅疾如猱。他技亦若此。無不令觀者驚心駭目也。去之日。忽揚言女長多累。誰能起之者則婿之。不需一文値。時有武孝廉顧某者。神力人也。　絃適斷。而更涎女美。出應徵。父坐女於拷栳。令顧掇之。顧盡平生力持之。覺力重不可數計。有頃。砰然聲發。栳栳圈脫。而女中坐如故。斜睨顧而一笑。父與衆。皆前。譽其能。然終偕女而去。勿與焉。因思人之體積重量。至爲有限。何來多力。不能無疑。物理試騐。玻璃相疊。不能直揭。覆平鑊蓋於水面亦然。非鑊蓋之增力也。蓋與水旣密切無空。欲起蓋。并須起水。則費力自多矣。俗傳甘鳳池仰臥。令人縶其手足而槓之。皆不動。漸益至數十人。則蹶然而起。背上黏附泥塊之大。可等其身。此非可與鑊蓋貼水例乎。凡上所述。皆必此類。特不悉何以能使足背。甚至栲栳底等。與地密切無空。此仍非練習有素者不可矣。徐君又言。方屠不能起女時。抱其身而左右臬兀。父遽前呵止之。謂止許直提。不能搖曳云云。</p>

<h3>十九年棉業之經過</h3>
<p>十九年之棉紡已又由進展之途而趨向頽敗之境、其原因固多、而世界一般經濟界之頽唐、國内戰事未休、匪共又復擾攘不已、實爲重要者也、茲將十九年經過狀况、略述如左、</p>
<p>（甲）棉紡業槪况</p>
<p>中國棉紡業自歐戰後、由黃金時代而趨向頽敗者幾七八年、紗廠破產者迭見、迨十六年形勢漸轉、十七年五三案發生、全國又復統一、頽敗之華商紗廠乃勃然而興、至十八年而益盛、增錠擴充者時聞、企業家從而投資者亦突起、其情勢之蓬勃、歐戰時之黃金時代、殊有再見之象、迨下半年和平之局面又告動搖、至十九年形勢益見嚴重、戰事旣延長作九月、而内地之匪亂又復與時俱進、投資者爲之裏足、更以滙兌發生劇烈之變化、金銀價之差率益巨、新廠之進行固告停滯、即舊廠增錠之計劃、亦爲之阻、各廠營業狀况大都艱困、减工者迭見、目前國内紡錠合中外商計之、可四百二十三萬七千七百十八枚、比十八年增七萬餘、以日商之增加率爲大、茲將十九年末紗錠數列下、</p>

<p>英商一六九、二二八一、九○○</p>
<p>計四、二三七、七一六二九、七二二</p>
<p>（乙）紗花市况</p>
<p>紗市以紡錠增加、生產率亦隨之增高、而銷費因西北風雲緊張、爲時旣久、戰區蔓延又廣匪共蠢動、即窮鄕僻壤莫不波及、故未能與生產成相當之比例、各月存數均在十萬包以上、國外市塲以經濟界一般的頽敗、不景氣籠罩全球、花紗市價頻跌、見十餘年來未有之低價、乃自一月以降成直線的低落、棉市亦屬萎疲、蓋美棉消費激减、由一角七分半而步落、至歲底跌破一角大關印棉復以國内政局不寗、眨價競售、紗市又復虚弱也、然國内棉收以氣候失調、殊爲歉薄、萎疲之情形、較之紗市爲平和、茲再將紗花市况分段列下、</p>
<p>（三）紗市呈直線的跌落</p>
<p>紗市在一月間時適廢暦年關現銷清淡、但期貨交易頗屬熱閙、初以存紗增加、有一度之跌風、終以滙市步縮、棉市活動、且新稅則即將實行、足以遏止外紗之進口、市勢轉穩、月末市價爲本年度之最高峰、二月份以海外市塲之慘落、西北風雲又緊、市况虚疲、尤以標紗跌風爲厲、現貨市况以四川内地有不斷的需要、春銷時期轉瞬即屆、市勢較平、三月間以時局惡化消息頻傳、海外市塲又向疲境、客銷難以激動悲觀之象益顯、幸北帮有一度之旺銷海外市况又復轉穩市勢略回、然心環境不良、終難挽此頽勢、徘徊於五十二三兩、回憶去年此時之一百八十三兩、不禁有滄桑之感、四月份以三月末賣方收貨、準備操縱四月、曾一度跌進五十兩、終以外市回漲、多頭態度鎭定而復盤旋於五十二三兩、長江帮生意尙陸續不絕、仍得維持其平穩之地位、五月初仍繼四月之頽象、時事固仍惡化、三品紗曾跌至一百三十九元九角、爲一九一六年來所僅見、惟以滙票關係、合價仍高、多頭强拉、未受嚴重之壓迫、下旬金價狂漲、客銷又動、廣帮收進現貨二萬包、人氣激昂、疲滯之紗市、轉向穩途前進、六月初旬之紗市、純爲金貴勢力所支配、現銷亦有一度興奮、空方恐慌、逼近六十兩關口、嗣以美棉跌至一角三分`三品紗又復狂跌至九十八圓之新低價`人心震動`現銷又以時局紛擾`消息益緊`殊爲清淡`致穩定乍見之紗市`又退入萎疲不振之地位`月末三品紗又進百元關`爲民三後之新低價`日紗運華銷售已屬有利`日信等公司定購二十支三馬·寳來數千包`合價較滬紗爲低`紗市又受一重壓迫矣`七月份以紗廠有减少工作`或停止夜工之舉`而實銷較有起色`遂由衰靡轉趨穩定`而止於八兩`蓋實際上以時局紛擾不已`海外市塲又復搖曳不定`雖在秋銷時期`現銷僅有不斷的需要而已`八月初以中央軍順利`人心一振`現銷又暢`曾一度達六十兩`詎美棉跌風又厲`自一角三分而至一角一分`内地匪禍益烈`各才態度不復如初旬之活動`際此秋銷時期`實銷冷落`市氣又疲`潮帮抛賣甚力`幸大買戶鎭定`未有猛烈之跌風`然疲象益形顯著`九月初以兵匪爲患愈甚`需要岑寂`存底激增`日紗復貶價抛售`市况益虚`而退人五十兩`嗣以東北通電和平`各帮搜羅殊殷`市勢遂迅速的向穩境推進`然以棉市頽敗`漲風戢止`而盤旋於五十二三兩`十月承上月和平之消息`市勢尙定`詎事實上時局雖告敉平`而各帮態度依然沉悶`海外花市又復一蹶不振`穩定之人氣又轉告失望`而重現頽風`蓋以此次戰事爲時旣久`區或又廣`更以匪禍遍地`各處元氣`損失過大`恢復未易`購買力因之大减賣方氣熖愈盛`乃見四十六兩之低價`十一月市况仍趨向平疲之途`年關漸近`客銷大清`迨下旬中堅買方之態度忽告消極`了結頗多`虚頽之風乃益甚`至十二月初跌風更厲一瀉千里`買方完全放棄`且以手中呀貨`向市塲套賣`大賣戶復向本月份猛抛`其勢愈虚`而見三二五兩五錢之橷低價`近遠期之差價竟達八兩餘`詎政府裁撤厘金`改征棉紗統稅`年關結賬延期舉行`客帮爲避免新稅計`對於現貨吸進殊湧`市况活躍`反動甚烈`旬日間漲幾十兩`而以四十五兩一錢度歲焉`一年間紗市之變遷已如上述`茲將期貨最高低價及成交數列表如下`</p>

<p>汽車新聞</p>
<p>専論</p>
<h3>英國汽車工業進化史</h3>
<p>近世汽車發達之國。除美洲新大陸首屈一指外當以大不列顚居次席。試一廻溯其三十年來之進步史與他國比較之。亦一饒有趣味之事也。按三十年前。英國所有之各種汽車尙不满三千輛。從事製造汽車者。不足二千人。蓋當二十世紀之始。汽車工業猶在萌芽時代。一般民衆對於汽車一物。胥視爲玩好奢侈之品。殊不注意。近今所謂汽車速度紀錄及耐久試騐等名詞。悉未創出。至若十二缸及十六缸汽車之設計。與夫造新紀錄如「金箭號」者之驚人成績。尤非當時人士所能夢想。而在今日。汽車工業上之一切發展。他且無論。僅就需用之人工而言。每日已達二直餘萬之衆。可想見其趨勢之孟晋。不僅爲致富之源·且亦足爲一般失業者之一種救濟也。</p>
<p>欲明英國汽車業進步之由來。宜先略述法德諸國先進之程序。蓋英國現在汽車之發達。雖佔第二席。然其創興實較他國爲遲。考法國當時有汽車二千八百九十七輛。其中之用於工業者僅五百四十三輛。一八九五年曾以汽車作初次競賽。自巴黎至波爾多往返共七百四十四英里。得勝之車。形式粗陋。並無頂頭汽門及化汽機之設備。所經盡崎嶇不平之劣路。平均每小時僅行十五英里。　一八九六年後。法國汽車工業進肯極速。而一切工商孱</p>
<p>業由是乃益臻發達。德國素以工業著稱。對於汽車之研究。尤注全神。因其與交通軍事師努力於運輸方法之工作。實無時不殫精竭智。以謀世界運輸業之革新。果也七年之内。成績大著。僅一九○七年度。一歲中已造成汽車二萬七千零二十六輛。足徵進展之速。至於美國當一九○○年。僅　有値價一百二十九萬元之汽車六百輛。爾時亨得福特猶是一少年工程師。日惟夢想自製其理想中之汽車。而其結果卒成爲世界最大之汽車製造家。地屈爾猶是他種工業繁榮之區。經三十年汽車専家之薈萃經營。竟成爲今日汽車工業之中心區。發展如此。更非他國所及三十年前。英國汽車界先進。鑒於法蘭西之以汽車而致百業繁盛。激發其競爭之觀念。始從事製造汽車。同時世界各國亦漸知汽車功用之宏。咸欲總握汽車工業之樞鈕。以爭先着。遂起劇烈之競鬥。因此對於各項製車原料。如油、橡皮、鋼鐵、及五金之類。亦聯帶發生國際之大角逐此實爲英國創造汽車之第一時期。由是遂日進無休矣。</p>
<p>復因一九○○年之初。各國爭以鉅資全力。用於汽車工業。冀得戰勝於國外市塲。乃制定汽車法規。以立國内市塲之保障。對於建樹速率、耐久、等新紀錄之専家不惜予以優厚之獎勵。所耗之資殆亦盈千累萬。其提倡鼓勵之策。有如此者自後汽車運輸之業乃日益發達。駸駸乎與輪舶鐵路相抗衡。國中荒僻之區。一變而爲繁盛之市。此皆三十年中發達之成績。在昔法規未頒佈前。汽車進展之趨勢。動多障碍。計自一八九六迄一九○四年間。所造之汽車。其重量與載重未有能逾三噸者。至於貨車。且在禁止之列。</p>
<p>當一九○○年之際。大不不列顚與愛爾蘭汽車總會即今之皇家汽車總會。曾有汽車里週游之組織。以獎掖有志之士。是爲汽車遠征之噧矢。當時參加者亦殊踴躍。歷游各大成鎭且及蘇格蘭之區域、轍所屆。備受當地之盛大歡迎。良以事屬創舉。聞者見莫不驚奇。咸欲爭飽眼福於是商停於市。農輟於野。相率來觀。即深在地層之煤礦職工。亦棄其開掘工作。來觀此利用汽油爲人控御之奇異機械。歡迎會舉行之際。銀行工廠且休業參加。足見此二十世紀之重要新機械。殆無地無人不深注意之。而汽車一物。爲陸路運輸之唯一利器。亦可由此種熱烈表現。予民衆以確切之信任。與深刻之印象也。</p>
<p>自一九○五年英國汽車之數已七倍於昔。越兩載。各製造廠之出產力益增。每月可造客貨車千輛。迨一九一○年。全年產額達一萬四千輛。後十年。全英汽車製造廠。合英格蘭·愛爾蘭·蘇格蘭·計之。已達八十家。服務者凡四萬餘人。惟愛爾蘭則僅有一小廠耳。個中三十家現仍沿用舊名。繼續營業。其餘或已停業。或與他廠合併。或擴充組織。另錫新名。此各廠沿革之大略。至於出產量數。近十年來更有增進。自一九二二年迄去歲。已由三萬八千輛之年產。激增至十八萬零四百餘輛。今年產額。或更增多。前途發達。實方興未艾也。</p>
<h3>車胎之使用及保護法</h3>
<p>粵珊</p>
<p>車胎之價値頗高。小者每只數十兩。大者竟百數十兩。汽車之消費。除油料外。即算車胎。而胎壽命之長短。乃全看使用時之情形如何爲轉移。際茲金貴銀賤。胎價驟漲之時。欲免無益之損耗。對此請加以注意也。</p>
<p>（一）車胎之裝置車胎是裝在鋼圈上。惟裝時。有數種應注意之手續。即鋼圈内不宜塗漆。因漆乾後。常剥脫。銹則立生。此銹使橡膠與鋼圈粘着。如　住然。殊不易使脫。欲免此弊。宜在裝胎前。塗少許黑鉛油ＧraisseGraphitee於鋼圈上。</p>
<p>當内胎未放入外胎以前。應該確知固定氣門之螺釘。業已上緊。氣門内之機件。亦宜同時加以檢查。</p>
<p>外胎内部。務宜清潔。週有他物。應即傾出之。胎骨布繩。應完健無斷裂或將斷裂處。將内胎先打氣少許。然後放入外胎内。蓋如此可免其絞扭或嵌入脚跟處。次即放上襯帶。襯帶之大小。應與車胎符合。放時宜小心。不應使之折起。放好後。再加少許氣。如是則極易上鋼圈。</p>
<p>宜將圓孔。靠緊内胎。撱圓孔在外面。與鋼圈相觸。倘非如此。則内胎易被鉗住。次察視車胎口邊。是否與鋼圈这捲邊接觸妥貼。</p>
<p>胎旣上好以後在未打满氣以前。應在胎之周圍。打繫數次。使胎易與鋼圈密合。氣打满後。裝上氣門蓋。即可備用。</p>
<p>（二）能負重量與膨脹力。用氣胎之目的。爲使全車舒軟。胎内有空氣。其舒軟之程度。全看空氣之壓力如何而定。此種壓力。因胎而異。與能負之重有關。不宜太强。亦不宜太弱。打氣時。應依製造家所規定之壓力表行之。因用此壓力。方得其壽命長久也。表内之數目。均是由經騐得來。非隨意亂定者。故宜注意遵守之。</p>
<p>（三）載量過重與膨脹不足氣胎受一定之膨脹後。僅能負載一定之最大重量。苟重量小於此最大數。膨脹之程度又正與負重相符合時。則胎命甚長。若重量大於該胎所能負者。則雖膨脹充足。其屈伸振幅。逐漸增朋。卒致過度。其結果將與膨脹不足之損害同。</p>
<p>此二種情形。車胎骨架。均受過分工作。布繩漸次變弱。不久即不堪再用。當載量超過愈甚。膨脹愈不足時。氣胎之命運。益愈短促。</p>
<p>載量過重之毛病是使胎易穿破。割斷及增　。</p>
<p>打氣致超過必須之膨脹時。常使胎疲困。亦不　宜。</p>
<p>過載量過重。必須更換大胎。切不可仍使原胎只多打氣。</p>
<p>膨脹不足時。苟勉强行車。胎邊脚跟。必致破脫。氣愈不足。損壞必愈甚。倘行路較遠。不但外胎無用。内胎亦將破壞不堪矣。</p>
<p>胎内之壓力。關係該胎之壽命。故宜保持適應之恒量。而不可使生變化也·</p>
<p>（四）車胎之損壞（甲）外護層之磨壞。其最大原因。爲使用之情形不對。及道路太壞。車輪不平行。外護層亦易壞。因此時車輪觸地之部份。不在旋轉平面上。勢必强使護層。就地磨擦。此種毛病。常顯於前車輪。</p>
<p>車輪轉時擺動。鋼圈之中心不對。以及共其他相似之原因。均足使車胎有不平均及迅速之磨損。</p>
<p>使用制動器過多時。外護層頗受損。遇車輪滑溜。必致刮脫橡膠。留有殘屑於地上。遇驟然開車。亦常刮脫橡膠。</p>
<p>加速太甚。因磨擦力與熱度均被增加。故甚壞胎。</p>
<p>已壞及正修築未完或凍裂不平之道路。均爲車胎之勁敵。因在凹凸過甚之路上。其每軸所負之重。原平均分配於大面積之上者今聚集於突出之最小部份上故橡膠頗易刮脫。胎骨繩亦易弄斷。</p>
<p>（乙）胎骨離解即外護層與布層或布層與布層間之分開也。此種損壞原因爲載量過重或壓力不足。胎骨各部受工作過甚所致。當分開初起時。在二分開之面間。即生磨擦力發生熱度。不久遂全行分開。</p>
<p>内部旣離解之胎。稍遇增熱即將爆裂。内胎亦同時發熱。有時並在外胎先爆裂。凡未補好之破縫。苟由此透入泥濘。灰塵等物。頗危險。常使車胎爆裂。</p>
<p>（丙）胎骨繩之斷裂其最大原因。爲膨脹不足或裝載過重。屈伸過甚所致。苟胎突然衝於街旁石沿或途中洞口之上氣不足時。亦會斷裂胎骨繩。</p>
<p>當胎骨繩。稍有斷裂不甚大時。應即修理之。否則拓張太大。遂無法修理。</p>
<p>（丁）外胎壞邊即鈎着鋼圈之部份破壞。此多由屈伸過甚。鋼圈不良得來。</p>
<p>苟鋼圈捲起之部份不對。則胎不得妥裝於其上。必立被割破遇鋼圈之捲邊壓下或變態時。即宜修理。最好換新者。因修理好之鋼圈總難如法。生銹之鋼圈上在銹未除盡以前。不應裝胎。</p>
<p>（戊）胎側之磨壞。胎側之橡膠。的用以保護胎骨。防水之侵蝕及側面之磨擦者也。在街道上行走之車。因時常强烈磨擦於街沿上故易損壞。在爛泥路或保管不好之路以及結有硬水塊之睡。胎側均受極烈之磨擦。欲避免之。必須當在上述之路上開車時。格外小心足失。</p>
<p>苟磨擦太甚。胎骨現於外部時。即宜從速再上橡膠。否則曝露日久。致傷及胎骨。</p>
<p>（己）外護層穿洞破裂。外護層之破裂。爲各胎所公有。惟汽胎。則更危險。因在該胎之破裂處。常逐漸增大。含蓄外物。二破裂塊之間。又常剥脫。此剥脫處極易進水於胎骨内部。若不從速修理。必至腐蝕。遂不堪再用。</p>
<p>（庚）内胎之破裂。此種破裂。不全由橡膠薄弱或其他缺點得來。當其尺碼與外胎不合。如太長太寛。在外胎内折起。致偶爾被拑住。或太狹小。膨脹後。延長過甚。均爲致破裂之原因。</p>
<p>用便宜内胎。即用次等原料所造之胎。並不經濟。除非在舊外胎上用之。以舊内胎裝於新外胎内。殊不適宜。</p>
<p>内胎之爆裂。多由於在裝時被拑於外胎脚跟下。當胎軟下。脚跟移動。遂致爆裂。内胎偶與銹鋼圈接觸。會破縫或全割斷。在厚邊之外胎内。苟未放好。被折起。亦常斷裂。</p>
<p>内胎亦如外胎。苟無氣時。　　　行車。必致損壞而不堪再用。車行太快。載量又過重。或壓力不足時。增熱極快。此種熱度。對耐用方面極有防碍。務宜注意之。（五）使用與保護之秘訣。車胎價値之高。已如前言。故使用時務宜特别注意。茲將上述各點。總錄於下。用備參考焉。</p>
<p>（一）檢查胎内膨脹之程度。</p>
<p>（二）無汽時即行停車。（三）檢查車輪之平行狀態。（四）謹記滑油日光火熱均爲損胎之原因（五）備換之胎應包好如法保藏之。（六）生銹或已壞之鋼圈。最好不用。（七）遇胎側稍有破裂時。即行修理`（八）檢查制動器。務使其在各車輪上之力極其均匀。（九）禁止嚴勵之衝擊。（十）所載重量。永不超過車胎所能負者以上。</p>
<p>（十一）出發時務宜漸進。不可過於驟然。</p>

<h3>英國開勃爾氏打破世界汽車速率</h3>
<p>沛</p>
<p>每小時駛行二百四十五英里</p>
<p>英國著名之汽車駕駛家。麥爾考姆開勃爾上尉。本月六日在台托那海灘。駕其無雙之「藍鳥」汽車。每小時駛行二百四十五英里。創立前此未有之世界汽車速率紀錄。開氏自稱。從此不再作汽車之速率試騐矣。</p>
<p>開勃爾上尉又駕奧司汀「孩兒」車。每小時行九四·○六英里。亦爲汽車界之新紀錄。開氏於二月五日。駕其千四百匹馬力之「藍鳥」汽車。每小時行程達二百四十六英里。前後共有兩次。然後開氏又躍入一奧司汀「孩兒」汽車。以期打破四十五立方生的密達之汽車紀錄。證明「英國所造之汽車。無論大小。均爲全世界之最佳者」。開氏第一日試騐時成績不過爾。至第二日郰二月六日。又作兩次之駛行。於是大告成功。首次駕小奧司汀時行九四·○六一英里。第二次則爲九三·九九四英里。此種紀錄均爲前此所未有者也。</p>
<p>英國之汽車駕駛専家及機械専門家。對於并勃爾上尉之每小時二四六英里紀錄。大爲欽仰。凡曾目擊「藍鳥」汽車者。均稱此車之速率尙能增高。開氏此次所駕之「藍鳥」汽車·不僅其材料及製作工程高人一等。即其式樣亦參酌各種經騐所得來者也。</p>
<p>據開勃爾上尉宣稱。伊對於自巳之新紀錄。不特再加推翻。但有他人能打破之者。則亦容當一試焉。又據開夫人稱。渠希望伊丈夫。對此紀錄满意。不再以生命冒險。夫人又稱伊夫之駛車。其行之速幾非目光所能接也。</p>
<p>英國汽車界之意。此次開勃爾上尉之新紀錄。打倒從前全世界之汽車速率紀錄。今後短時間内不將爲人所推翻也。一千九百二十九年時。亨萊來山　　　爵士曾以每小二百三十一里創爲未於之紀錄。今開勃爾上尉則較山氏加增十四英里推翻山氏之紀錄獎。</p>
<p>開勃爾上尉自創此新紀錄後。人均以「英國速率之王」稱之。渠於此次紀錄甚屬满意。然此舉之危險亦非常人所能意想。苟於出發之數秒鐘後。有一胎輪破壞者。開氏之生命其必矣。</p>
<p>開氏雖不願再行試騐汽車速率。然其意此一千四百匹馬力之「藍鳥」汽車。速率尙不至此。每小時二百七十英里亦意中事也。開夫人於其丈夫之决意。不再推翻其自己之紀錄其屬欣幸云。</p>

<h3>幸福的微波</h3>
<p>語溪</p>
<p>吃過夜酒、照例是要閙新房了、當我們衝進新房的時候、裏面已是擠满了女人、有的站在凳上、也有立在桌子上、緊緊地圍住那新娘、在等候著一些最好看的玩意兒發生、</p>
<p>妻也是女人叢中的一個、我們一道進去的是八八個男人、各人帶著極濃的興緻、與新娘方吃過「小夜飯」的新郎、見我們擺足了陳勢進來、知道將有一些很難應付的要求加到他身上、他想溜、然而給大力的抱住了、「今天你是主角、你好逃麽、」</p>
<p>我們對新娘下了許多要求、新娘都做了、最後我們要新郎新娘行禮接吻禮這事、新郎提出反對、他說、「這是外國的禮節、中國人爲什麽要行外國禮呢、就是要做、也祇有大學堂裏穿西裝講英文的人才配做、我不行·········」</p>
<p>但不管他理由如何充足、態度如何堅决、壎已經把他從桌上拖下來了、新郎不從、强、但新娘起立了、她在等候著新郎的啓吻啊·········</p>
<p>新郎的嘴與新娘的臉貼合了、</p>
<p>女人們拍手閧笑、</p>
<p>突然那半醉的韶向大衆說、「現在新郎新娘的接吻禮已經行過了、我提議在這新房裏的每對夫妻都要相互接吻、表示答禮、」</p>
<p>「贊成、韶第一個」壎　、女人們附和　　「第一個就第一個丨丨　、來、讓我來香你的嘴、」</p>
<p>女人倔是看得更有滋味了、誰知道</p>

<h3>The Central Political Council's Foreign Affairs Group Discusses the Russian Question</h3>
<p>Decides on Three Negotiation Principles</p>
<p>Agreement Reached on the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Nanjing. The Central Political Council's Foreign Affairs Group held a meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 5 PM on the 17th. Members present included Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Wu Tingfang, and Kong Xiangxi. Those present as observers included Mo Dehui and Li Jinlun. The meeting discussed the Russian question. As a result, negotiation principles regarding the restoration of traffic and trade on the Eastern Railway were decided. These principles will be sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be passed on to Mo Dehui so that he can respond appropriately when attending the meeting in Russia, based on these principles. The content is temporarily not being announced due to its relation to diplomatic secrets. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. At the Foreign Affairs Group meeting on the 17th, in addition to deciding on negotiation principles with Russia, the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction was also discussed.

<h3>First Memorial Week After Establishment of the Supervisory Yuan</h3>
<p>Yu Youren Encourages Staff to Study Party Doctrine</p>
<p>Nanjing. The Supervisory Yuan held a memorial week service for the late leader Sun Yat-sen on the morning of the 16th.</p>
<p>Chairman Yu Youren reported, briefly stating that the Yuan has been established and the supervisors will take office next Monday. The work of each staff member can then be assigned. Staff members under the National Government should have a deep understanding of Party doctrine. Party doctrine is the compass guiding the work. Without a deep understanding, one will be at a loss and there will be no hope of success. Yu’s life can be divided into three periods: the newspaper publishing period, the National Pacification Army period, and the Auditing Yuan management period. The first two periods were more difficult than the present. Now, open study is possible, and there are more instructors. He hopes everyone will work hard to study.

<h3>Restoration of Traffic and Trade Between China and Russia</h3>
<p>In Fact, No Longer a Problem</p>
<p>Beiping. The Japanese side is paying close attention to the restoration of traffic and trade between China and Russia. A certain European envoy said that there is no question of whether or not China and Russia will restore diplomatic relations. Since the agreement in Boli [Khabarovsk], China has sent representatives to Russia. Furthermore, the three eastern provinces and Xinjiang did not completely sever diplomatic relations during the war. Recently, Chinese and Russian consulates have been gradually restored. What is lacking now is merely the formality of restoring diplomatic relations, but in reality, diplomatic relations have already been restored. China and Russia share a long border, and in any case, diplomatic relations cannot but be restored. (17th)</p>
<h3>He Jian Sends a Telegram Urging Hunan Natives Abroad to Return to the Province</h3>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Changsha. On the 16th, He Jian sent a telegram to fellow Hunanese abroad, relayed by various newspapers, stating: "To the gentlemen of Hunan origin residing abroad, greetings. Hunan is unfortunate, with disasters following one another. When troops are dispatched to suppress bandits, Zhang Guigui seizes the opportunity to invade. When troops are returned to quell the rebellion, the communist bandits take the opportunity to cause trouble. My intelligence is limited and my measures are misguided, causing you, my fellow countrymen, to flee in haste to distant lands. With pain after the event, I feel deeply indebted. Now, the security of the provincial capital has been restored to its original state, and the bandits in various counties are gradually being wiped out. I hope that you gentlemen will soon pack your bags and return, without feeling like wandering duckweed. We hope to clear the thorns together. He Jian kowtows." (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Jin Army Carries Out Reorganization and Demobilization</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Headquarters to be Closed</p>

<h3>Various Silver Loan Plans</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Various plans regarding silver loans are summarized as follows: The International Banking Consortium and its chairman, Mr. Conant, advocate for a large low-interest loan of silver to the Chinese government, totaling approximately 500 million ounces (with the first batch being 200 million ounces). China will repay the silver, with the repayment period extended to 40 or 50 years. This silver will be used by China to mint silver coins to develop industries and economic construction projects, supervised by a joint committee. The number of members of the committee can be set at seven Chinese and seven representatives from relevant countries. Another member will be the President of the United States, or his direct representative. Mr. Zizler, the advisor on Eastern affairs for the committee, has been dispatched to Shanghai to seek China's consent and methods for this loan. If China approves of this, he will return to Washington D.C. to report everything, and then the official agencies will discuss the matter. Senator Pittman believes that if one waits for the convocation of a general meeting of the International Banking Consortium, the result will be a very long time with no practical effect. If a large sum can be loaned to China early, it can enable the Chinese people to have more jobs to maintain their livelihoods, reduce their current hardships, and increase the world silver price and China's purchasing power, enabling them to buy goods from countries using gold. The Eastern Trade Committee of the U.S. Senate also expresses deep sympathy for this loan plan. Both sides are very cooperative. Furthermore, Mr. Clarke advocates for the establishment of a China Construction Fund Management Committee, modeled after the China-U.S. Educational and Cultural Foundation Management Committee. Dr. Monroe's opinion on solving China's economic problems is to have Germany pay its reparations to England and France to China as a loan to the U.S., and he proposes four methods.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The German Left and Right Wing's Film Dispute</h3>
<p>The political parties of various countries in the world, if their views are opposite, then no matter what the matter, they can use it as a tool for attack, and no matter what kind of trivial matter, they can respond with retaliatory measures. Since the purpose is to attack and the means is to retaliate, then they will not have time to ask how the matter relates to the interests of the country, or how it affects the safety of society. Therefore, once a political dispute is started, there is no day of peace. How dangerous this is. As today's Berlin telegram says, left-wing parties opposed the screening of King Frederick the Great's historical film in movie theaters, almost causing a riot. A large number of police showed up to disperse the demonstration. Upon investigating the reason why the left-wing parties opposed this film, it was because they were resentful of the National Socialist Party's obstruction of the screening of the film "All Quiet on the Western Front," and they pointed out that this film was promoting imperial ideology and opposing pacifism, in order to retaliate. The National Socialist Party's opposition to "All Quiet on the Western Front" was originally an excuse to play up the issue, and now the left-wing parties' opposition to the Frederick the Great film is also playing up the issue because of the National Socialist Party's playing up of the issue. Even such a trivial matter is approached with such intention, then how would more relevant issues be used as an excuse to attack each other? This is why political disputes are so worrying. Although, all human beings have the desire to prevail over others and are unwilling to be humiliated. Therefore, no matter what kind of society in the world, retaliation is regarded as a necessary means of dealing with the world. Great as the earth-shattering wars, none of them arise from this. Is it only political parties that are like this?</p>

<h3>Political Situation in Spain Still No Progress</h3>
<p>King Invites Former Conservative Party Leader to Form Cabinet</p>
<p>The Tide of Republicanism is Overwhelming and Irresistible</p>
<p>Madrid, National Society, 16th: This morning, the King of Spain met with leaders of various factions, but the political situation is still unresolved. The King has now entrusted former Conservative Party leader Geralla to form a new cabinet. Although the new cabinet will be loyal to the monarchy, it will still rely on the support of the left-wing parties. The King originally ordered Alba, a prominent member of the Liberal Party currently living in Paris, to form a cabinet, but Alba refused to accept the appointment because he was dissatisfied with the King's conditions. He then wanted to have Admiral Asna form a cabinet, but Compo, the leader of the Catalan Autonomy Party, felt that the new cabinet's liberalism was not sufficient, so when he met with the King, he stated that he was unwilling to join the so-called reformist cabinet. Thus, the matter failed again. The new prime minister has temporarily drafted a list of cabinet members. The Minister of the Interior, Alvares, advocates for the immediate release of imprisoned Republican leaders, two of whom should be given cabinet seats, but the Republicans will not accept any position unless the King immediately leaves the country. After receiving the news, the King was very displeased and threatened that if Geralla could not form a cabinet, he would set up a ruling office and give it the powers of a dictator. The administrative procedures of the new cabinet stipulate that municipal and provincial elections will be held within three months, followed by elections for an electoral assembly to draft a new constitution. The above conditions have been approved by the King in advance. Although Geralla is a conservative monarchist, he has had significant disagreements with the King. Recently, he was implicated and imprisoned in a case of conspiring to rebel against the government. Republican leaders who are not in prison gathered in Segovia this afternoon and decided to unconditionally oppose the new cabinet.</p>

Akita and 15 others from the Seiyukai introduced an emergency motion regarding parliamentary proceedings and reported a motion to postpone the deliberation of the budget bill and a resolution on constitutional operations. Akita stated, "The purpose of the resolution is to not decide on the budget bill during the period when the acting prime minister is attending." He then began to speak on the essence of constitutional government and the essence of responsible politics, saying that the prime minister should not use the excuse of unforeseen accidents to ignore state affairs for a hundred days. There was a loud applause from the opposition parties. Akita also said, "The budget bill has already been decided by the general meeting, so it is okay to postpone it." The Speaker asked the audience to vote by standing, but it was rejected due to a small number. Yamazaki then explained the motion to return the budget bill, detailing the shortcomings of the financial plan, the incompleteness of the review, and the lack of policy, which were the main points of the motion to return the budget bill. Yagi then questioned whether the government was determined to resign if the revenue estimate was too high and exposed, and whether the government intended to propose a budget for the implementation of the relief law. Finance Minister Inoue replied, "The estimated number is not too high, and the relief law is planned to be implemented from the sixth year of Showa." The Speaker asked that the motion to return the budget bill and the budget bill be discussed at the same time. Zian from the Minseito system expressed his opinion in favor of the government's budget bill. Okuchi from the Seiyukai system expressed his opinion in favor of Mr. Yamazaki's motion to return the budget bill, and pointed out that the government had not implemented the political program when it formed the cabinet.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Japan Allied Press, 17th: Yesterday, the Seiyukai, in the name of General Affairs Director Shimada, issued a statement regarding the return of the budget. The contents are as follows: The government, regarding the financial plan, has completely forgotten the fundamental meaning of the finances of national public organizations, resulting in an overestimation of the financial plan. In particular, the tax reduction problem is almost impossible to implement due to the relationship with the naval replenishment plan. As for expenditures, there is no contribution to the advancement of national fortune. The current social and national problems of recession and unemployment policy have not been effective. Furthermore, the Prime Minister, who is primarily responsible for implementing the decision, did not attend when deliberating the budget bill, and Deputy Prime Minister Biken, who is not a party member, led the parliament, violating the fundamentals of the Constitution and failing to meet the reality of party politics. There is no doubt that this is the reason why our party dares to oppose this budget bill.</p>
<h3>German Leftists Oppose Screening of Prussian King Historical Film</h3>
<p>Accuse it of Promoting Imperialism</p>
<p>Purely a Retaliatory Action</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from 국민社 on the 15th: Today, dozens of leftists gathered outside a cinema, opposing the screening of a historical film about Prussian King Frederick the Great, almost causing a riot. A large contingent of police arrived, wielding batons, and arrested dozens of demonstrators before dispersing the crowd. This film has been showing at a major cinema here for several weeks without incident. After it moved to cinemas in the suburbs last week, various leftist parties, angered by the obstruction of the screening of "All Quiet on the Western Front" by the National Socialist Party, accused this film of promoting imperialist ideas and opposing pacifism, and strongly interfered as a retaliatory measure.</p>

<h3>Part of Sun Lianzhong's Army Enters Jiangxi First</h3>
<p>The Remaining Troops Will Continue South After Reorganization</p>
<p>The Issue of Sun's Army Entering Jiangxi Has Been Resolved Satisfactorily</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Sun Lianzhong's 26th Route Army was previously ordered to enter Jiangxi to suppress the Communists. Due to various internal difficulties, the date was repeatedly changed and the deployment could not be completed. Liu Yufen and Cao Haosen, who were sent by the Central Government to urge mobilization, returned to Beijing one after another a few days ago. On the 10th of this month, Ma Hongkui, the commander-in-chief of the 15th Route Army, especially went from Tailai to Jinan to discuss the matter of Sun's army departing with Han Fuqu. After continuous telegram exchanges with Sun and General Commander Chiang, a satisfactory result was achieved. It is now learned that after Ma Hongkui arrived in Jinan and consulted with Han several times, they jointly telegraphed Sun Lianzhong, stating their opinions that since the army had special difficulties and could not immediately enter Jiangxi, it would be better to go to Beijing together to meet General Commander Chiang, to explain the situation in person and ask the Central Government for forgiveness, so as to avoid misunderstandings. They also agreed to meet in Yanzhou as the gathering point, so that the three of them could go to Beijing together. Yesterday, they received a reply telegram from Sun, who greatly approved of this method and said that he would be waiting in Yanzhou and asked them to quickly go south together. Han and Ma immediately telegraphed General Commander Chiang to report in advance. They then received a reply telegram from Chiang, stating that since Sun's army had various difficulties in deploying, there was no need to rush the southward movement, and they could reorganize everything first. Han and Ma then telegraphed Chiang's intention to Sun. After receiving the telegram, Sun was extremely grateful for General Commander Chiang's forgiveness and decided that starting from the 17th of this month, he would first send a brigade to Jiangxi to show obedience to orders. As for the remaining troops, they would continue to deploy after reorganization was completed. Early this morning (15th), a telegram was sent to Han and Ma in Jinan, asking them to convey this intention to General Commander Chiang and to quickly allocate vehicles. After receiving the telegram, Han and Ma have telegraphed General Commander Chiang to report. (15th)</p>
<h3>Shi Yousan Returns All Seized Vehicles</h3>
<p>Insufficient Funds Force Zhang to Downsize Three Class A Divisions</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Shi Yousan's 13th Route Army seized more than 400 passenger and freight vehicles from the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Longhai Railways during military operations, as well as more than 20 locomotives. After the end of the military operations and the completion of unification, the railway authorities sought to rectify railway transportation and issued a clear order that all railway vehicles seized by the various armies should be returned in full within a specified period to maintain railway administration. After receiving the order, Shi's army returned a portion of the vehicles in the first batch. For the majority of the remaining vehicles, the Ministry of Railways repeatedly urged their return. Shi's army, feeling that the military funds were insufficient, temporarily retained the vehicles for operation to supplement the shortage of funds and maintain the soldiers' livelihoods. The Central Government was quite dissatisfied and telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang again, ordering him to return the vehicles quickly. Shi then came to Shenyang on the 10th of this month and met Zhang on the 11th to explain everything in person. He first telegraphed an order to prepare the second batch of vehicles for return. On the 12th, Zhang summoned him again and instructed him to return all the vehicles to comply with the law and avoid giving people cause for criticism. If his army had difficulties with funding, he could seek other ways to make up for it. Shi then complied with the instructions and, except for a small number of vehicles, about two trains, that were temporarily borrowed for ammunition, supplies, and clothing, returned all the remaining vehicles. He telegraphed all parties at noon on the 13th to handle the handover procedures, and also telegraphed the Shunde Headquarters to comply. The original telegram stated, "Shunde Deputy Commander Qin Jianbin, Chief of Staff Tang Zhengzhi, Ning Mi, I met the Deputy Commander yesterday and the discussion was very pleasant. Auxiliary Commander Zhang and Chairman Wan were very supportive and comforting. After investigation, the vehicles currently held by this headquarters, except for a small number (no more than two trains at most) occupied by ammunition, supplies, and clothing, and five trains borrowed by the Beining Railway and one train borrowed by Chairman Wang, have all been returned to the Central Government. In addition to separately and quickly telegraphing Director Gao and Chairman Wang for verification, please draft a telegram to the Central Government and notify Director He of the Pinghan Railway to send personnel to take over as soon as possible. Shi Yousan respectfully bows at noon." The issue of Shi's army seizing vehicles can now be considered resolved. As for the issue of having too many soldiers and too little funding for distribution, Zhang plans to implement a second downsizing to solve the problem once and for all. On the one hand, Zhang will request the Central Government to slightly increase the funding for this army. Shi's army underwent a first downsizing of six divisions, reorganized into two Class A divisions, each with three brigades, each with three regiments, and four Class B divisions, each with two brigades, each with two regiments. The current plan is to downsize to three Class A divisions. The number of officers and soldiers remaining after the downsizing is too large, which is actually more difficult, so it is still under careful consideration. Shi's departure date has not been determined and he will probably spend the New Year in Shenyang. (February 13th)</p>
<h3>Heilongjiang Frees Mohe Gold Mine</h3>
<p>Revises Methods for Miners</p>
<p>Gold Mine Discovered in Shiwei District</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Mohe Gold Mine in Heilongjiang is our country's only gold mine. It has been in operation for more than 40 years (mining began in the 15th year of the Guangxu reign). Although it has experienced Russian disturbances, it has always been restored afterward. However, during the Russian war two years ago, Soviet troops invaded from the border, drove the miners in the gully into Russian territory, and demolished the Mohe Gold Mine Bureau. All the constructions in the gully were also destroyed. Although the border area has been stable last year, Heilongjiang Province, after suffering a major disaster, was unable to fully restore the mine, so it ordered the Mohe County Magistrate to concurrently serve as the Director of the Gold Mine Bureau, and established the mine bureau within the county government, recruiting old miners to engage in mining. Originally, there were twelve gullies for gold mining, but four or five of them have been exhausted. The remaining areas have abundant ore deposits. However, due to the small number of workers and the occasional incursions by Russian soldiers, only the areas farther from the Russian border were mined first, so the gold production was not high. The Gold Mine Bureau previously stipulated the following measures for miners entering the gully for mining: (1) Miners entering the gully for gold mining must apply for a mining license, and each license costs two silver dollars for labor costs. (2) Miners should pay official gold according to the annual output amount. (3) Miners who are over 60 years old or have disabilities are exempt from applying for a mining license and are also exempt from paying official gold. (4) Merchants entering the gully to sell goods are required to pay 3% of the selling price as goods and profit tax. Recently, the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines believes that the mine has been seeking restoration after experiencing disasters, and it is necessary to change the above measures so that the miners can reduce their burden and the treasure can be developed as soon as possible. Therefore, it recently issued an order to the Mohe Gold Mine Bureau, ordering all gold mines and gold shops to be opened to everyone for mining. Any miner who mines gold sand only needs to pay 24 torah of official gold per month (one torah in Russian weight is equal to one cent in our country), and must obtain a mining license from the county before mining, with each license reduced by one dollar for labor costs. All other taxes and fees are temporarily exempted. Those over 60 years of age and those with disabilities still follow the previous methods, exempting them from applying for licenses and exempting them from paying official gold. However, the mined gold sand is not allowed to be sold privately to the outside. All of it must be purchased by the official silver branch at a fair market price, and foreigners are prohibited from recruiting workers to mine and purchasing gold sand to show restrictions. The promulgation of this new chapter hopes to encourage miners to enter the gully for mining. It is also heard that the four districts of Heilongjiang border, Shiwei, Qigan, Huma, and Fushan, are all traversed by the Outer Xing'an Mountains and all have discovered gold mines. Russians often cross the border to mine privately. Our border is wide open and no one cares. The endless treasures accumulated underground are bound to be coveted by others. (February 12th)</p>

<p>Teachers and Staff Sit-In to Demand Education Funds Only four months of maintenance fees for the 20th fiscal year have been received by schools in Wuyi County, specifically for the months of August, September, October and November. As of now, there are still four months of supplementary funds and the full fees for December and January, totaling more than 50,000 yuan, needed to be paid. In the past half month, the principals of various urban and rural schools have repeatedly demanded payment from the Education Bureau. Director Pan Zushu found that the Finance Bureau owed more than 90,000 yuan in education funds (due to shortfalls from busy canal transport) and consulted with Finance Bureau Director Liu Hongzhao on solutions. As a result, Director Pan raised 15,000 yuan, Mao Zhongsheng, the head of the Western Treasury of the Finance Bureau, raised 20,000 yuan, and Director Liu negotiated with the Chamber of Commerce to borrow 10,000 yuan from the money houses. An agreement was reached, but unexpectedly, Director Liu used the money borrowed from the money houses to advance payments in response to an urgent telegram from the Finance Department, causing the education funds to fall through. On the 15th, teachers and staff went to the county bureau to sit-in and demand the owed funds. County Magistrate Zhang and Director Liu are discussing the matter with the financial sector, but the financial sector says that due to continuous rain and snow, the account situation is not good and the cash received is limited, fearing that it cannot cope, so this issue is not easy to solve.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Develops Northeast Shipping Routes</h3>
<p>Establishing a Branch Office in Yingkou</p>
<p>Yingkou is the seaport of Northeast China. Every year, a large amount of soybeans and soybean oil are exported. In recent years, Chinese merchant ships have occasionally passed through, but Japanese ships are competing fiercely. Li Zhonggong, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to expand Northeast shipping and resist the encroachment of Japanese ships, held a meeting with Shen Zhongyi, the Chief of Business Tax, and decided to add commercial ships to Northeast routes. This matter has been completed. This matter is of great importance to shipping rights and transportation. What I have heard is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Investigate General Manager Li, in order to determine to add special commercial ships to Yingkou and recover the transportation rights of soybeans and miscellaneous grains, specially sent Lin Jicai to Yingkou to conduct on-site investigations. According to the report, the special products of Yingkou are soybeans, white beans, sorghum, and chestnuts. The next largest are medicinal materials and furs, which are mostly shipped to Shanghai, followed by Shantou, Guangzhou, and Xiamen. According to the Yingkou Customs report, based on the statistics of the 18th year of the Republic, there were 632 Chinese ships, accounting for 689,300 tons of declared numbers, more than 320 Japanese ships, accounting for 378,900 numbers, and 260 British ships, accounting for more than 330,000 numbers. The Japanese merchants who travel between Shanghai and Yingkou include Nippon Yusen, Osaka Shosen, Dalian Kisen, and Mitsui. The British merchants include Taikoo and Jardine Matheson.</p>
<p>The Chinese merchants include Zhaoxing, Yu Da, Zhengji, and other companies.</p>
<p>Goods Entering and Exiting Yingkou Most of the imported goods are shipped from Shanghai, and the rest are shipped from Japan. According to the Yingkou Customs report in the 18th year of the Republic, imported foreign goods were worth 179,800 taels of silver. Imported domestic goods are mostly flour, which is mostly shipped from the Sanxin Factory in Shanghai and is handled by Yonghexiang. According to reports, 1.6 million bags of wheat flour were shipped from Shanghai last year. The rest are domestic cotton cloth and other items, about three or four thousand pieces per year. According to the statistics of imported domestic goods in the 18th year of the Republic, the value was more than 279,000 taels of silver. The main export domestic goods are soybeans. According to the statistics of the 18th year of the Republic, those directly shipped to foreign countries were worth 113,200 taels, those shipped to various treaty ports were worth 193,000 taels, and those shipped locally were worth more than 355,000 taels. 780,000 tons of Fushun coal were shipped from Yingkou annually, of which 640,000 tons were shipped to Shanghai. The Dalian Kisen Company, a Japanese shipping company, specially built four ships last year to plot a voyage to Yingkou. This was opposed by various local groups, who stopped loading their ships. All the exported soybeans and miscellaneous grains were shipped by Zhaoxing and other ships. Today, the Japanese ships are trying to make a comeback. The Chianshan Maru, Yushan Maru, and Kunshan Maru, etc., are planned to operate the Shanghai-Yingkou route when the ice thaws. The Osaka-Yingkou route of the Nippon Yusen also took the opportunity to expand.</p>
<p>China Merchants Starts Shipping In order to develop Northeast shipping, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided to open two formal shipping routes in Yingkou: one to Shanghai and one to Shantou and Guangzhou. In the Shanghai route, the Huinan ship has been designated to sail to Yingkou. The Director designated Lin Jicai. The quota for the Shanghai route is 88,000 yuan per year. The quota for the Yingkou-Xiamen-Shantou route is 95,000 yuan per year. The monthly expenses of the Yingkou branch are estimated at 1,520 yuan, which is given at 95% according to the quota. The shortfall will be supplemented by the head office. Lin has personally gone to Yingkou to inspect and decided that the original docks and warehouses need to be repaired. The start-up fee is set at 6,600 yuan. The Shanghai branch has been issued by General Manager Li to the Business Section Chief Shen Zhongyi for review. As soon as the Huadong opens, it will officially start the route.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's News Regarding Postal Workers' Demands</h3>
<p>Bureau Claims Solution Is Not Difficult</p>
<p>The demands made by postal workers in this port have been ongoing for more than ten days. Qian Chunqi, the Director-General of Postal Services, considered this matter of great importance and personally went to Beijing to consult with Wang Boqun, the Minister of Communications. The day before yesterday, he returned to Shanghai with Yu Feipeng, the Vice Minister of Communications, and Dou Juecang, the Chairman of the Labor Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Communications, to seek a thorough resolution of the postal workers' demands. On that afternoon, Commissioner Dou, along with Yu Xianglin, the Chief of General Affairs of the Postal Bureau, Secretary Yang Sili, and others, convened a meeting with representatives from the labor side. A reporter from the Riri News visited Secretary Yang Sili of the Postal Bureau yesterday. According to him, Chairman Dou convened a meeting with representatives from the Postal Workers' Union, including Fu Dewei, Miao Hongjun, Chen Xuzhou, and representatives from the Postal Service Union, including Qi Jiamou, Zhang Kechang, and Zhu Xuefan. The result was generally satisfactory. The central issue of the workers' demands is the reorganization of the labor union, with housing subsidies being secondary. Due to the postal service's poor financial situation and continuous losses, it is difficult to provide housing subsidies. The issue of labor union reorganization cannot be definitively answered by the Postal Bureau and the Ministry of Communications. Understanding has been reached with the labor side, and it is expected that a satisfactory resolution can be achieved within one or two days, preventing further serious incidents. This can be reported to all sectors of society, etc. The general content of Chairman Dou's statement was also similar.</p>
<h3>Both Railway Lines Will Issue an Additional Half-Month Bonus to Workers</h3>
<p>But Only After This Year's Interest Payments Are Cleared</p>
<p>According to the Ministry's regulations, the year-end bonus for railway employees cannot exceed 20% of the net profit. The actual amount to be issued should be determined by the Ministry of Railways based on the annual financial situation of each line. Last month, the authorities of both railway lines, citing the meritorious service of employees in handling rear-area military transportation during the past year, which was a time of military operations, requested the Ministry of Railways to approve the issuance of the year-end bonus for the 19th year of the Republic, equivalent to one and a half months' salary for the employees, based on 20% of last year's net profit. The Ministry has already approved the issuance of one month's salary. The workers have since made further requests. As they have worked throughout the year, their anticipation for a larger bonus is understandable, which is only human and not particularly surprising. However, it is reported that last year, due to the impact of military operations on both railway lines, military transportation accounting accounted for about half of the so-called total surplus, which was not actual cash. Furthermore, due to the soaring gold prices last year, which increased by about one-third compared to the past, the value of imported goods was extraordinarily high. The railway line itself had been neglected for many years. Under the rule of the National Government, it should no longer be delayed. The necessary expenses for renovation and improvement, ranging from locomotives and carriages to sleepers and minor components, are all imported from overseas, resulting in significant capital expenditure. According to the contract, interest and dividends due have not been paid due to the lack of available funds. However, interest payments are related to foreign credit and must be cleared. Unexpectedly, gold prices have continued to rise this year, doubling. According to the bureau's estimate, this year's deficit may reach around 4 million yuan. If measures to raise funds and remedy the situation are not taken promptly, the railway will face bankruptcy. The Ministry of Railways, recognizing this, believes that in addition to reducing expenditures, efforts should be made to increase revenue. As the workers' monthly salaries are relatively low, their anticipation for bonuses is high. It is reported that the Ministry intends to approve an additional half-month bonus for the workers, but only after this year's interest payments are cleared, as a measure of comprehensive consideration, etc.</p>
<h3>Municipal Training Committee Appoints Preparatory Members for the Publishing Industry Union</h3>
<p>Wang Wenhua and Eleven Others</p>
<p>The Public Training Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department believes that all labor unions in the city should be reorganized and established in accordance with the central government's order within this month. The unions in various industries and districts or the municipal labor union have mostly appointed members to prepare for this. Yesterday, eleven preparatory members for the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union were appointed. The appointment order has been issued, stating: "For the purpose of issuing orders and appointments, Wang Wenhua, Yang Youren, Gu Rongsheng, Ni Xiaoxian, Wang Yongliang, Zhou Zhicheng, Shen Shifang, Wan *** Sheng, Zhu Jixiang, Chen Yusheng, and Shen Anzhou, totaling eleven persons, are hereby appointed as preparatory members for the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union, and Wang Wenhua is designated as the convener for the first meeting. In addition to separate orders, they are hereby ordered to assume their positions and report accordingly. This order is issued."</p>
<h3>Expansion of Business at the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau</h3>
<p>Branch Offices Established in Beijing and Hankou</p>
<p>Shanghai Branch Reorganized on the 21st</p>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, since its establishment, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has experienced exceptional growth in business. Recently, in order to expand its business, the Bureau has specially established branch offices in Nanjing and Hankou to meet the needs of the public. This has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and is scheduled to open simultaneously in both locations on March 15th. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, originally located downstairs at the Fuzhou Road headquarters, has also been reorganized and renamed the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, scheduled to be formally established on February 21st. It will continue to handle savings, remittances, and all other business. It is also reported that since the Shanghai Branch added savings services and expanded its remittance area, its business situation has shown further progress. The business counters occupied a considerable area, but due to the growth of business and the increasing number of customers, it still feels insufficient. Therefore, the existing premises have been expanded significantly and construction has begun. It is expected to be completed soon. Once completed, the area will be larger than before, and coupled with the courteous attitude and efficiency of the branch's staff, customers will surely feel more pleasant and satisfied, etc.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Guangxin Native Place Association Requesting the Suppression of the People's Society</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Shanghai Native Place Association of Seven Counties in Guangxin, Jiangxi Province, to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Minister He: (Omissions in titles) "Our Jiangxi is unfortunately plagued by bandits year after year. Almost none of the 81 counties in the province is free of them. Among them, the most tragic, severe, and prolonged suffering is in the eastern Jiangxi counties of Hengfeng, Qianshan, Shangrao, Yiyang, Guixi, etc. Since the summer of the 16th year of the Republic, when communist bandits Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping organized farmers' associations in Yi and Heng counties with only six guns brought from the province, Luo Ying, the regimental commander stationed there, was blinded by greed and sat idly by without suppressing them. A small spark has now grown into an unquenchable fire, a truly painful situation to recount. Over the years, the people of eastern Jiangxi have made appeals through letters and telegrams, their voices hoarse and their strength exhausted. However, those in authority have disregarded Fang and Shao as insignificant clowns and viewed Zhu and Mao as the Red Army. This error in judgment has led to a serious mistake. The past is as it is, what more can be said? Fortunately, Commander-in-Chief Chiang has dispatched troops for strict suppression, and Minister He has come to Jiangxi to oversee the operations, appointing two division commanders, Ruan and Xu, specifically to take on the task of suppressing bandits in the seven counties of Guangxin. We, the people, are all overjoyed and anticipate the capture of the communist bandits in short order. However, in the eastern Jiangxi region, outsiders only know of Fang and Shao but are unaware of the People's Society of Fujian and the bandit leaders Wang Ming from Qianshan.</p>
<p>The southwestern three districts, villages, and towns have almost entirely been devastated by them. On January 29th of this year, Battalion Commander Qu led a team to Qiancheng for a two-day stay. On the 30th, Battalion Commander Qu received orders to be stationed in Yi. However, on the 31st, Yang***, in the western district of Qianshan, was completely burned and looted by bandit leaders Wang Minggui and Ding Duanmin, etc. They then fled from the west to the east, burning and looting Dakeng on February 2nd. The destruction of the villages is indescribable. Recently, there have been rumors of attacks on Tu*** Shilang (30 li from the county seat) and the county seat, causing panic among the people. The situation is precarious. If Qiancheng is lost, then Hekou will be under attack from both sides, making it impossible to defend. The two bandits, Fang and Shao, have recently dispatched bandit leader Dong Dao, leading several hundred guns, to join the People's Society and Wang Minggui to disrupt the rear. Their plan is indeed insidious. We urge you to order the two division commanders, Ruan and Xu, not to disregard the People's Society of Fujian and the bandits Wang Minggui and Ding Duanmin, etc., as small sparks to avoid repeating past mistakes. It would be fortunate for eastern Jiangxi and fortunate for the Party and the country."</p>
<p>Another telegram sent to the two division commanders, Xu and Ruan: (Omissions in titles) "Guangxin is unfortunate to have been suffering from the brutal killings of Fang, Shao, and the Fujian bandits for a long time. Cities and towns have fallen repeatedly, villages have been reduced to ruins, and death and displacement have been extremely cruel. We are alarmed by the bandit disasters and mourn for our homeland, grieving for our elders, siblings, and cousins who are subjected to the terror of being burned and killed by the communists every day. We are unaware of the extent of their tears and weeping. Fortunately, the central government has specially dispatched Commander-in-Chief He to lead a large army to Jiangxi to suppress the communist bandits and has tasked your esteemed divisions with clearing the bandit disasters in the seven counties of Guangxin. It is expected that wherever the banners go, the communist bandits will disappear. Hearing this from afar, we are extremely grateful. Recently, we received letters from our hometown stating that the old nests of Fang and Shao have been broken by our troops, and the armed bandits have fled into the Shilang and Chepan areas of Qianshan County, joining forces with the Fujian People's Society bandits, causing arson and killings everywhere, threatening to capture Qianshan County. The remaining scattered small groups have fled into the mountains bordering Shangrao, Yushan, Geyang, and Hengfeng, causing harm everywhere and raising fears of the fall of Yushan. We fear that a small spark can start a prairie fire and that a trickle can become a river. We respectfully read Commander-in-Chief Chiang's proclamation to the people of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, stating that this suppression of bandits must not only extinguish the large groups but also thoroughly eliminate the scattered small groups, ensuring the capture of their leaders, the dispersal of their followers, and the eradication of their roots, leaving no opportunity for them to rise from the ashes and causing future harm to the people. We deeply hope that your esteemed divisions will adhere to Commander-in-Chief Chiang's proposal, making a thorough plan for suppression to relieve the suffering of the people. It would be fortunate for Guangxin and fortunate for the Party and the country."</p>
<h3>Settlement of Chinese Merchant Deeds Concluded</h3>

<h3>Executive Committee Meeting of the Medical and Pharmaceutical Society</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Medical and Pharmaceutical Society of the Republic of China held a meeting on the afternoon of the 14th of this month at 7:00 PM and resolved the following matters: (1) Regarding whether the Society has any opinions on the newly promulgated Higher Western Medicine Regulations, it was resolved that the aforementioned regulations apply to the constitutional era. Currently, for medical practitioners who have already established their practices, temporary measures should be established separately. The Provisional Western Medicine Regulations previously stipulated by the Legislative Yuan seem to be of this nature and can be followed. As there are temporary measures for civil servants, lawyers, and accountants, physicians should be treated equally. (2) Regarding whether the Society should express any opinion on the reported imminent establishment of the National Medicine Institute, it was resolved that reorganizing national medicine with old physicians who do not understand science will not achieve any results in the future. The Society should vehemently state the pros and cons to the authorities, and Mr. Yu Yun*** should be asked to draft the statement. (3) Regarding the letter of resignation from Executive Committee Member Shen Zheng, it was resolved that a letter should be sent to retain him. (4) In addition to inviting professors from various universities to attend the general meeting and give lectures, letters should also be sent to invite Guangdong and Beiping Universities.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Spring Scenery and Snow Scenery in One Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>Red Garments and Green Garments Reflected in a Silver World</p>
<p>Firecrackers in Succession, Shops Closing Their Doors</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Lunar New Year's Day, coinciding with the rest day after the settlement of accounts by the business community in this port. People from all walks of life, on the evening before, carried lanterns and account books, rushing around to collect debts, traveling far and wide, day and night. Residents of the concession areas, however, still could not forget the customs, so firecrackers echoed all night, and gongs and drums resounded throughout the streets, doubling the excitement. Unfortunately, the weather was not favorable. The north wind howled, and by evening, snowflakes began to fall. The sound of the rain mingled with the sound of firecrackers and gongs and drums was quite pleasant to hear. As midnight approached, heavy snow fell, fluttering like willow catkins in the air, covering the ground in white. By daybreak, the entire city of Shanghai had been transformed into silver. By 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the rain and snow had stopped, and the accumulated snow on the streets was nearly five inches deep. The firecrackers announcing the opening of doors crackled again, creating a scene of intense noise. Greetings of "Congratulations and prosperity!" were frequently carried on the wind into people's ears. Children, dressed in red and green clothes, raced along the snowy roads, reflecting the silver-clad world. They went to neighbors' homes, vying to offer New Year's greetings. Shops were all closed, and the doors were covered with red couplets with new and unique phrases. Larger stores opened half of their doors, with family members playing gongs and drums for fun. Although tobacco and paper shops were not open, they still conducted small businesses through the original square holes in the doors, appearing to be in a state of closing. Beggars displayed their ingenuity in various ways. Some carried red paper with black images printed on them, chanting and sending New Year's greetings to the shops, hoping to receive one or two copper coins. Others were dressed in paper-made lions, beating gongs and drums, and leaping on the snowy ground to entertain people and solicit sweets. The sounds of dice games and mahjong could be heard in every alleyway. Hawkers selling sweets and red and green necessities were everywhere to be seen.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit After the Xue Family Settlement</h3>
<p>Plaintiff Says Defendant Lacks Sincerity</p>
<p>Defendant Still Claims Illness and Fails to Appear in Court</p>
<p>Xue Wang Amei, the legal representative of Xue Baobao, the daughter of the deceased Xue Baorun, hired a lawyer to sue Xue Gu Qiaolin, Xue Sunshi, Xue Jiasheng, Yansheng, Gansheng, Gensheng, etc., in the Public Concession Court for fraudulent settlement. The case was heard again yesterday. First, the plaintiff's representative, Lawyer Pan Chenge, stated that although the defendant's side sent someone to the plaintiff's residence offering 200,000 or 300,000, the Xue family's assets were over 10 million, which was far from the amount requested by the plaintiff. Therefore, the settlement was unsuccessful. It was clear that the defendant's side had no sincerity in settling. He requested that the court rule according to the plaintiff's request. The defendant's representative, Lawyer Lin Yingqing, argued that the defendant was ill and therefore did not appear in court. Furthermore, Xue Sunshi and Xue Gu Qiaolin had already reached a settlement previously, so there was no reason for a second settlement. He requested that the case be dismissed. Judge Gong Cheng ruled that the case would be adjourned for a rehearing.</p>
<h3>Bodyguard Member Commits Murder and Robbery</h3>
<p>Rapidly Cracked by the Bodyguard</p>
<p>In Yaojiaqiao Port, which belongs to Qingpu County, north of the Shanghai West Airport, east of Zhonggu, and west of Guanyintang, a robbery and shooting occurred on the morning of the day before yesterday at approximately 9:35 AM. The details are explored below:</p>
<p>Background: Zhan Zhangfa, a Shaoxing native around 40 years old, was a boatman. He had a nephew named A Da, 19 years old, who worked on the boat with Zhan. They often traveled between Zhonggu and Guanyintang. On the 14th of this month, Zhan received payment for goods in Guanyintang, totaling 377 silver dollars, which he hid on the boat, intending to transport them to Zhonggu. Because Zhan had been traveling there for a long time, he was quite familiar with the local villagers. After receiving the payment, Lu Amao and Zhang Zhenxin, bodyguard members whom Zhan knew, asked Zhan when he would set sail. Zhan did not take it to heart and casually replied that he would leave tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>Robbery and Shooting: At dawn on the day of the incident, Zhan set sail from Guanyintang, heading straight for Zhonggu. As the boat passed Yaojiaqiao Port, three people resembling bandits suddenly appeared on the shore, each holding a pistol, forcing the boat to stop. Seeing the critical situation, Zhan moored the boat by the shore. The three immediately rushed onto the boat. His nephew, A Da, who was at the bow of the boat, recognized Lu Amao and Zhang Zhenxin (also known as Li Xiaoyousheng) and Cheng Qigui. Just as he was about to greet them, Lu Amao fired the first shot, firing two shots in succession, killing his nephew. They then took all the cash and fled ashore.</p>
<p>Case Solved: Seeing the tragic scene, Zhan hid in the back cabin, trembling for a long time. He then sailed the boat back to Guanyintang and reported the incident to the local police and bodyguard. Zhu Zhuoran, the head of the bodyguard, was shocked upon hearing the news and immediately sent someone to arrest Lu Amao. The pistol issued to Lu by the bodyguard was inspected, and it was found that the barrel had just been fired. It was also found that two of the 30 bullets issued to each bodyguard member were missing. Under Zhu's interrogation, Lu confessed that he had colluded with Zhang and Cheng to commit the robbery and shooting. After obtaining the confession, Zhu immediately sent someone to arrest Zhang and Cheng. Zhang, whose finger had been grazed by a bullet during the shooting and whose feet were covered in mud, was caught while bandaging his finger and washing his feet. However, Cheng Qigui fled upon hearing the news and disappeared without a trace. Zhu then prepared a document and sent Zhang and Cheng to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<p>Corpse Examination: County Magistrate Yu of Qingpu sent personnel to the scene with the examiner. The examiner determined that the deceased had been shot and killed, with one bullet entering the back of the head and another injuring the back. After the examination, Zhan Zhangfa was instructed to sign a statement and take possession of the body for coffin and burial, etc.</p>
<h3>Suspect in Kidnapping Case, Gu Afu</h3>
<p>Police Still Investigating</p>
<p>Gu Afu, a worker in the packaging room of the No. 7 Fuxin Flour Mill from Wujin County, Changzhou, was arrested in his hometown on the 17th of last month in connection with a case. It was only after interrogation that it was discovered that Gu was suspected of being involved in the kidnapping of Ren Shaorong in Shanghai. The county government sent a document and dispatched detectives to escort Gu to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, Gu was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the police investigation of the defendant was not yet complete and requested an extension. After Judge Cheng Shangfeng interrogated the defendant Gu Arong, he ordered him to be detained for seven days for further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Robbers Encounter Police on the Road</h3>
<p>Wang A'gen and Ji Youcai Handed Over to the Authorities</p>
<p>At 4:10 AM on the 16th of this month, two Chinese constables, No. 2575 and No. 2108, of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, were patrolling their jurisdiction when they spotted two people carrying a large package on Yu Yuan Road. Their appearance was suspicious, so they stopped them to inquire about the contents. Both were speechless and unable to answer, so they were arrested. Upon opening the package, it was found to contain 24 pieces of men's and women's clothing. They were taken to the police station and interrogated. It was learned that their names were Wang A'gen and Ji Youcai. After investigation by Chinese Detective Yu Changyuan, it was discovered that Wang and Ji were actually robbers and that all the clothing was stolen goods. It turned out that at around 3:00 AM on the 16th, five robbers broke into the home of Wu Lin, a resident of No. 52 Qianjia Lane in the Chinese area of western Shanghai, threatening her with guns and stealing 120 silver dollars, 71 cents in small coins, 20 pieces of clothing, and a pair of gold bracelets. They divided the loot and fled, only to be arrested in the concession. The victim Wu Lin had also reported the incident to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. Therefore, the detective notified the Sixth District, and yesterday morning, Wang and others were escorted to the Special District Local Court. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the case. Liu Shaoqing, a detective from the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, submitted an official document requesting the transfer. The victim, Wu Lin, also testified about the robbery and identified the two defendants as being present during the robbery and confirmed that the recovered clothing was the stolen goods. When interrogated, the two defendants admitted to colluding with others to commit the robbery. Judge Cheng Shangfeng approved the transfer of the two robbers, Wang and Ji, to the officers for investigation.</p>
<h3>Communist Printed Matter Found on Thief</h3>
<p>One Shot in the Leg</p>
<p>Detention Extended for Three Months</p>
<p>Hu Yuexin from Ningbo broke into a money exchange shop at No. 97 of Avenue Edward VII at dawn on December 26th of last year. He stole three paper packages and fled with the loot when he was spotted by Constable No. 354 of the French Concession Police. The constable stepped forward to arrest him, but Hu dashed north, fleeing to Guangdong Road in the British Concession. The constable chased after him, shouting for him to stop, but he did not listen. The constable drew his gun and fired, hitting Hu's right leg, causing him to fall to the ground, at which point he was apprehended. He was taken back to the French Concession Police Station. The police chief opened the loot and found that the packages contained three bundles of communist printed matter. He immediately ordered detectives to summon Li Yilong, the manager of the money exchange, for questioning. Li stated that although the shop door had been pried open, upon inspection, nothing was missing. However, these three packages were definitely not items belonging to the shop. Furthermore, the shop employees were all asleep when Hu committed the theft. Hu insisted that the packages were indeed stolen from the plaintiff's shop. The police chief ordered his detention and yesterday, he was sent to the French Court for further investigation. First, the police chief explained the situation, and then the plaintiff, Li Yilong, filed a complaint about the defendant breaking into the shop with the intent to steal. Hu Yuexin's testimony was the same as what he had said at the police station. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Hu to three months in the Western Jail as a warning. The printed matter was ordered to be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Poisoned by Coal Gas, One Dead, One Critical</h3>
<p>Ding Ashun from Wuxi, 49 years old, lived upstairs at the Fuyuanxiang cigarette paper shop on Old Garbage Bridge. He worked as a tea server at the Dahua Theater on Zhejiang Road. Yesterday afternoon, he and his wife, Ding Ye, were at home warming themselves by the fire when they were suddenly poisoned by coal gas. Both husband and wife lost consciousness. Neighbors rushed them to Baolong Hospital for treatment. By the time they arrived, it was already 6 p.m. Ding Ye was too deeply poisoned and could not be saved. She died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Ding Ashun's condition was also quite dangerous. The deceased was 37 years old and from Jiangyin.</p>
<h3>Five Robbers Steal in Zilai Street</h3>
<p>At 8:20 last night, five robbers broke into No. 47 Zilai Street in the French Concession. Three of the robbers carried guns and forbade anyone from making noise.

<h3>Three Gamblers</h3>
<p>Xu Desheng from Qingjiang, together with Jiang Ada from Kunshan and Wang Lanting from Zhili, set up a gambling den at Tangjia Lane in Qipu Road at around 9:00 yesterday morning, luring people to gamble and swindling them out of their money.

<h3>Embroidery Industry Requests Exemption from Business Tax</h3>
<p>A letter from the Lace and Embroidery Industry Association to the Tax Regulations Research Committee of Various Industry Associations: We are writing to inform you that the abolition of likin tax is not only a removal of policies that harm businesses, but also a sincere effort to promote domestic goods. The central government's resolute implementation of this policy is deeply gratifying to the public. However, the lace and embroidery industry, which relies entirely on the handiwork of impoverished women, has never been subject to any taxes. An order issued in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915) completely exempted it from taxes. Recently, we have read that the business tax rates issued by the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces impose a tax of as much as 20 per mille on lace and embroidery, which is alarming. At a time when overseas markets are declining, it is already difficult to sustain the industry. If we are further burdened with a business tax of 20 per mille, it will be impossible to recover. Therefore, we present several points to your committee: The lace and embroidery industry relies entirely on handiwork, and the number of impoverished women nationwide who depend on it for sustenance is very large. Most businesses in this industry receive orders and materials from foreign merchants and rely on low wages for female workers to eke out a small profit. In recent years, they have been affected by the decline in overseas markets, and prices have fallen as a result. If the burden of business tax is increased, it will be impossible to maintain the industry. While the industry itself is not worth lamenting, what about the impoverished women who rely on it for a living? Therefore, we request that you convey to the relevant authorities the need to uphold the late Premier's legacy of promoting people's livelihood and exempt the lace and embroidery industry from business tax. Secondly, lace and embroidery are mostly daily necessities for families in Europe and America, and domestic sales are minimal. Chinese businesses have only been involved in this industry for over 40 years. Because the government has exempted it from taxes, the selling price is lower than that of Portugal and Japan. Foreign trade amounts to a certain amount each year. If the burden of business tax is increased at this time of business decline, the selling price will increase with costs, and sales will be further hindered. The governments of Portugal, Japan, and other countries, in order to support the domestic handicrafts industry, not only do not levy taxes on the lace and embroidery industry, but also refund the taxes paid when the materials are imported when the finished goods are exported. Therefore, we request that you convey to the relevant authorities the need to consider the main purpose of encouraging domestic goods for foreign trade and exempt the lace and embroidery industry from business tax. Thirdly, it is clearly stipulated in the guidelines that the business tax is intended to compensate for the losses incurred by local authorities from the abolition of likin. The lace and embroidery industry has not been subject to any taxes or likin for over 40 years. Therefore, there is no loss from the abolition of likin, and there is no need to compensate by imposing an additional burden on businesses. Therefore, we request that you convey the need to exempt the lace and embroidery industry from business tax in accordance with the provisions of the guidelines. Based on the above reasons, we hereby write to request that your committee convey to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry the need to issue a general order to all provinces and cities to uniformly exempt the lace and embroidery industry from business tax in order to maintain the industry and benefit the people's livelihood. Sincerely, The Lace and Embroidery Industry Association To the Tax Regulations Research Committee of Various Industry Associations in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Water Company Replies to Property Association Letter</h3>
<p>The Property Association Prepares to Refute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association received a reply from the Shanghai Waterworks Company yesterday, stating: "We received your letter of the 26th regarding the issue of the water company charging water fees based on gross rent. According to the water rate schedule agreed upon between the water company and the Municipal Council, all domestic water consumption should be charged based on the actual rent paid by the tenants, without any reductions. According to the long-standing custom acknowledged by landlords, the 'appurtenances' of the property refer to items for which the tenants do not deduct the cost from their rent. Before 1927, the water fee for foreign residences was 4% of the gross rent, while that for Chinese residences was 5%. The reason for this difference was that when the water price was set in 1905, it was clarified that the water consumption of Chinese residences, relative to their rent, was higher than that of foreign residences. In 1927, when the water price was revised, this difference was decided to be eliminated, with the understanding that the water price would henceforth be calculated based on gross rent. The issue of charging based on net rent was also considered at the time, but was shelved due to differing opinions on the interpretation of 'net rent.' The water company sets the water price to ensure a certain level of revenue. Therefore, even if the water price were calculated based on rent, the rate would inevitably increase, so that the resulting amount paid would be no different. Furthermore, the current water price rate is set to expire on December 31st of this year. Therefore, if it is considered that there is a need to change the current method of calculating fees based on gross rent, it should be reconsidered at that time. Until the end of this year, the company will have no choice but to charge based on gross rent, as stipulated in the contract. We are hereby replying accordingly, and hope that you will take note." The Real Estate Association, upon receiving the reply, considered it unsatisfactory and is preparing a detailed refutation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Steamer Fare Increase Issue</h3>
<p>The Tea Room Workers' Union Firmly Opposes</p>
<p>Telegraphs the Ministry of Communications to Find a Way to Stop It</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo steamers of the China Merchants Sanbei Ningshao Company have recently increased their expenses due to the addition of escort teams. After deliberation by the three companies, they decided to increase the fares for all classes of passengers, effective from the 18th of this month. After the news was released, the Shanghai-Ningbo Steamer Tea Room Workers' Union was the first to object. The Ningbo business community then responded, and efforts to reduce the prices have not yet achieved their goal. The Tea Room Workers' Union telegraphed the Ministry of Communications yesterday, requesting it to find a way to stop the increase. The full text of the telegram is as follows: To Minister Wang Jun of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing: The Shanghai-Ningbo steamers have arbitrarily increased passenger fares in the name of adding escort teams, harming shipping and affecting workers' livelihoods. The Shanghai and Ningbo communities have repeatedly opposed this without success. We earnestly request that you quickly telegraph to stop this, in order to benefit travelers and alleviate the plight of workers. We are deeply concerned and urgently request your consideration and verification. Respectfully submitted, Shanghai-Ningbo Steamer Tea Room Workers' Union."</p>
<h3>New Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Thomson Takes Over</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Colonel P. B. O'Brien Butler, the Commandant of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, has completed his term of office. His successor has been selected by the British War Office from among the supernumerary officers of the New Ulster regiment. Lieutenant Colonel Thomson will come to Shanghai to take over. Because New Ulster is in financial straits and urgently needs to reduce redundant officials and save government expenses, it has broken the precedent of selecting from supernumerary officers. Thomson is 50 years old and has a long military career. He was recently sent by the local government to study new-style national defense at the Imperial Defence College in London. He graduated last month and was assigned to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Academia Sinica to Exhibit Archaeological Achievements in Nanjing</h3>
<p>For the convenience of organizing historical materials, the Institute of History and Philology of the National Academia Sinica is temporarily located in Peiping. The Institute was originally divided into three groups: Historical Materials, Linguistics, and Archaeology. The Archaeology Group specializes in excavation work. Since the autumn of 1928, the group has excavated the Yin Ruins site in Xiaotun Village, Anyang, three times during the autumn and spring rainy seasons of 1929. Many of the ancient artifacts unearthed have never been seen before and have long attracted the attention of archaeologists around the world. In the autumn of 1930, the group excavated the Chengziya site in Licheng, Shandong. The lower layer contained relics from the Neolithic Age, and the upper layer contained relics from the Tan State. More than 20,000 pieces of pottery and stone tools were obtained, and the results were remarkable, which had already been reported in various newspapers. The Academy has notified the Institute to select a portion of the essence of all the excavation achievements of the past three years and transport them to Nanjing for exhibition, so as to provide a reference for historians and to arouse the interest of the Chinese people in archaeology. The Institute has now sent the director of the Archaeology Group, Li Ji, and researcher Dong Zuobin to Nanjing to escort the ancient artifacts and specimens. Li is going to Jinan to transport the Chengziya artifacts and will arrive in Nanjing tomorrow. Dong arrived at the General Office yesterday. Among the items that have been transported are inscribed animal skulls and tortoise shells, oracle bone inscriptions, stone tools, bronze wares, shell wares, pottery shards, and bone wares unearthed from the Yin Ruins, as well as stone tools, shell wares, and divination bones from Chengziya, totaling more than 1,000 pieces, all of which are precious items. After Li Ji transports the black pottery and other items from Chengziya, he will select a location and schedule an exhibition in the near future, and will also hold public lectures. It is also heard that the First Group of the Institute has made excellent progress in organizing the historical materials of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and will also bring some archives for exhibition at the same time.</p>
<h3>Ministry Orders Promotion of Phonetic Symbols in Mongolia and Tibet</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has ordered the leagues and banners of Mongolia and Tibet to promptly select personnel to study in the phonetic symbol training classes organized by the educational administrative organs of neighboring provinces and cities. After completing the training, they should return to their original places to teach and promote the phonetic symbols. The order stated that the promotion of phonetic symbols is the most important work for unifying the national language and popularizing education. The Central Government, in view of this, specially resolved to promote phonetic symbols at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and ordered the Ministry of Education to formulate measures for implementation by the educational organs of various provinces. Now, in order to promote Mongolian and Tibetan culture and unify the national language, it is necessary to promote phonetic symbols in Mongolia and Tibet. Therefore, the leagues and banners are ordered to promptly select personnel to study in the phonetic symbol training classes organized by the educational administrative organs of the following provinces and cities: Hebei, Peiping, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, and Xinjiang. After completing the training, they should return to their original places to teach, in order to promote the phonetic symbols and achieve significant results.</p>
<h3>Science Society of China Issues Declaration Regarding the Qingdao Observatory Japanese Personnel Case</h3>
<p>The Science Society of China issued a declaration to the government authorities and academic groups in China regarding the unresolved case of Japanese personnel at the Qingdao Observatory, which stated: "Since the Japanese returned Qingdao in 1922, we have known about the Qingdao Observatory. We also know that the diplomatic authorities at that time failed to negotiate thoroughly, and that some 'guest-like' Japanese personnel remained at the observatory. However, few people outside the observatory know about the work being done there. In 1926, there was an international longitude measurement project, and the Qingdao Observatory also participated in it. In 1928, the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture also subsidized the observatory with 25,000 yuan for the purchase of equatorial instruments. We then learned more about the general progress of the observatory's work. In August of last year, members of the Science Society of China visited Qingdao to hold the Fifteenth Annual Meeting. Since the observatory was the earliest scientific institution in Qingdao, we visited it and investigated its contents in detail. We then learned that the observatory's academic work includes astronomy, meteorology, oceanography, geomagnetism, and seismology. The main items of the astronomy department are transit observations, sunspot observations, local time service, radio time signals, and the compilation of seasonal tables. The meteorology department adopts a 24-hour observation system, publishes daily weather maps, makes weather forecasts, and reports the positions of high and low pressure centers in the Far East for navigation. In addition to marine meteorology, oceanography also collects marine animals, plants, and minerals. Geomagnetism has both absolute observation and self-recording instrument observation. The seismograph is a Wiechert's horizontal seismograph, and all earthquakes in Japan and China in recent years have been recorded. Looking at these achievements, everyone is satisfied. As for the Japanese personnel case, the general idea of Director Jiang's report is that when the Shandong issue began, the Japanese argued that China had no meteorological talent and that the Qingdao Meteorological Observatory must be retained. After negotiations, it was agreed that:</p>
<p>(A) Temporarily, Japanese staff would not receive remuneration from China and would continue to perform their duties to maintain the operation of the Chinese Meteorological Observatory. The Chinese government should facilitate the exchange of telegrams between the Chinese Meteorological Observatory and the Japanese Meteorological Observatory.</p>
<p>(B) In the future, when Chinese Meteorological Observatory staff are trained, the reporting and liaison methods with the Japanese Meteorological Observatory should be revised when the old staff are replaced.</p>
<p>Although the clauses are like this, in reality, Chinese staff have been developing on their own since the establishment of the observatory, because Chinese people do not need Japan to operate and maintain this kind of meteorological work. In 1924, Inomata Takeshi, a senior Japanese staff member stationed at the observatory, submitted a proposal stating that China already had the technical personnel and that the Qingdao Meteorological Observatory's business should be entirely handed over to the management of Chinese technicians. The previous agreement on the Qingdao Meteorological Observatory should be temporarily abolished. At that time, the Japanese staff were ready to hand over, but the domestic Second Zhili-Fengtian War occurred, and no one in the foreign ministry was responsible, so it was shelved. In March 1928, an order was received from the Bureau of Commerce stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had urged the Japanese ambassador to discuss the handover of the Chinese and Japanese staff at the observatory, but it was not implemented due to the war in Shandong. Since then, many negotiations have been made, but to no avail. Recently, matters outside the agreement have been involved, and there is an implicit tone of representing the academic community of our country. In its demands to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it states that meteorology, seismology, and astronomy can be handled by Chinese staff, but because China has not joined the International Association of Geomagnetism, Japan represents East Asia and Japanese staff should be left in the observatory to observe geomagnetism. These demands go beyond the scope of the agreement and are unbearable.</p>
<p>If this case is not resolved for a day, it will be a disgrace to our academic community. Based on the above facts and the results of on-site observations, we know that it is necessary to resolve this case as soon as possible. Although academics are not limited by national boundaries, all countries aim to increase their international status through scientific independence. In recent years, Japanese publications in various disciplines have been published in their own language to achieve this goal. Only in the case of neighboring countries with the same writing and culture does Japan think of being a substitute for others, which is dishonorable in the international community. Moreover, the huge amount of money spent by the Japanese each year to set up this superimposition of facilities in Qingdao is also uneconomical from a scientific point of view. However, the Japanese know this and still do it stubbornly, which shows that their intentions are different. In general, the cultural aggression of imperialists is even more cruel than economic aggression in terms of means. Therefore, we are making a solemn statement for the Qingdao Observatory, and respectfully request the government authorities to pay close attention to it, and for domestic academic groups to provide joint assistance, so as to eliminate this kind of unequal treaty and make science independent. This is the only purpose of our Science Society of China."</p>

The guiding function depends on educational methods. On the one hand, train the individual's nature; on the other hand, make them understand the social organization, national conditions, world situation, and the individual's position and mutual relationship, and study a method of self-reliance and helping others. From the soundness of each individual to the soundness of the group, the soundness of the country, all progress can not only eliminate international disputes, but also lead the world to universal harmony. His words were inspiring and insightful. After the lecture, Principal Liu stood up and thanked him before dismissing the meeting.</p>

<p>One Comment. Autumn Water.</p>
<p>Marriage. It's like a bank. Whether you're happy or sad. It's all you've deposited over the years.</p>
<p>Men's verbal promises. Are like the weather reports published in newspapers. They can never be truly trusted. However, women, driven by hope, often tirelessly demand certain verbal promises from men.</p>
<p>When a newly married couple. Starts discussing all the benefits they've given up for the sake of marriage. They're already likely headed for divorce.</p>
<p>When a man has concluded that "there must be pain in love." He must have reached the age of philosophy. In other words. He has reached the year he will die.</p>
<p>There must be pain in love. There must be a headache after drinking. And there must be a considerable price for buying happiness. These are timeless and undeniable truths.</p>
<p>Don't tell your secrets to your woman and tell her to keep them strictly. Because she has her own secrets. She can't focus on two things at once. Keep your secrets even more carefully.</p>
<p>Short socks are cooler and prettier than long stockings. However, the fact that bare jade feet are revealed is obvious. But it can never arouse men's mysterious fantasies. It's not worth it to reveal the active, poetic, fleshy charm to the public.</p>
<p>A man. May lose his hair. His money. His memory. And everything else he owns. But the nickname he got in his childhood. Will remain forever. And will not disappear.</p>
<p>The pain that men feel when they marry in old age is this: older women no longer stir their heartstrings, and younger women are good, but women look down on them.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes from Wumen</h3>
<p>The Ox-Herding Old Man</p>
<p>Scholar Peng's Lawsuit: The four great families of Suzhou: Peng, Song, Pan, and Han. Peng ranks first. Because grandfather and grandson were both top scholars. Peng Dingqiu was the top scholar in the provincial examination and the imperial examination. His son, Yilong, was recommended as an upright and filial person. His grandson, Qifeng, also became the top scholar in the provincial examination. The world praised them for their glory. When Qifeng was young and had not yet passed the examinations, he acted as a guarantor for a friend who was selling farmland. Fifty years later. Qifeng retired from his position as Minister of the Grand Secretariat and lived at home, receiving a first-rank salary. Suddenly, the old land deed caused disputes, leading to litigation between the two parties. Tracing the source back to the original guarantor, A and B, they had to appear in court to testify. The magistrate of Wu County saw that the plaintiff's statement mentioned Peng Qifeng. He didn't know that Peng Qifeng was a retired top scholar and prime minister. He immediately issued a warrant to arrest him. Peng then wrote a quatrain on the back of the warrant: "I laugh at myself, Peng Qifeng, sold land for a friend and became a guarantor. My name was personally inscribed by the emperor, and now I see a touch of red in the county court." The bailiff returned to report with the warrant. The magistrate was shocked and almost lost his mind. He quickly dismissed his attendants and went to Peng's residence to plead guilty. Peng dismissed it with a smile. And instructed him to handle the case fairly. To this day, the people of Wu still recite this story.</p>
<p>Qi Ziqing's Study and the Blind Storyteller's Novel "Two Gold Ingots": This is a story from the Ming Dynasty. It contains a section about suing in Suzhou, asking the lawyer Qi Ziqing from Yinguo Lane to write the draft. Qi Ziqing was indeed a real person. He was a wealthy man from Wu County. In his early years, he entered the school and became a student. He lived in Yinguo Lane. He had a library at home, with a plaque that read "Mandarin Duck Tower." The book scrolls and jade shafts were arranged in a quiet and secluded manner. (See Yu Quyuan's notes). This doesn't match the blind storyteller's lyrics in "Two Gold Ingots." By the Qing Dynasty, his library was the former site of the Xiuye Thatched Cottage and Five Hundred Plum Blossom Temple of Gu Xiajun (Silveus), a scholar from Changzhou. To the left was the tomb of Princess Miaoyan. A piece of fragrant soil still remains to this day. But the Plum Blossom Temple and Mandarin Duck Tower are covered in desolate smoke and mist. It's a sigh that famous scholars are not as good as beautiful women.</p>
<h3>Model Merchant</h3>
<p>Chao Tian</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Hailou of Changsha was very intelligent as a child. Unfortunately, limited by his family circumstances, he dropped out of school very early. He traveled with a friend to Jiangsu and Anhui. The hardship he endured cannot be described in words. But his spirit of perseverance and enterprise is worthy of emulation by readers.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu knew the pain of being uneducated. So he was determined to study hard in his spare time. And he wrote and painted every morning and evening. For decades, without interruption. Therefore, his works are very exquisite. And he often gave them to friends. Later, realizing the corruption in the officialdom, he turned to industry and commerce. In Nanguan, Kaifeng, he established the Dazhong Match Company and the Dasheng Soap Factory. He managed them diligently and painstakingly. And he put in great effort. As a result, he had strong capital. The scale grew day by day. In the industrial and commercial circles of Henan, he was the leading figure. The reason why he was respected was his adherence to integrity and trustworthiness. Henan was plagued by endless wars. Its financial resources were exhausted. The authorities often asked him to assist in managing government affairs. But he firmly declined. However, he served as the president of the Hunan and Hubei Fellow Townsmen Association and the president of the Henan Chamber of Commerce. These were voluntary positions. And they were based on the premise of public interest. Although there were many thorny issues. He was happy to take on the challenge. He did not shirk hard work. Especially his ability to handle difficult situations effectively. And his diligence and integrity in handling affairs. Therefore, he almost certainly became the president of the Henan Chamber of Commerce. And the fellow townsmen who benefited from his work were not just a few. Now that he is old but still healthy. Recalling Xiangshui and Yueyun, he has a strong desire to return to the south. But he often tells people, "If my company stops operating, thousands of workers will be in dire straits. It is better to dismiss personal prejudices. And seek the safety of the majority of people." Therefore, he is even more committed to his original goals. And he is engaged in reclamation and revitalization projects. Seeing him stand tall in the midst of war. And achieve remarkable results. He is truly worthy of praise. And cannot but be admired.</p>
<h3>A Record of an Unusual Person Selling Her Daughter</h3>
<p>Yi Yi Luzhu</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Xu returned from Haining. On the way, he met an old man. Seemed like a street performer. Leading a girl. About ten years old. The old man told the crowd. "My girl is getting older. I want to sell her to avoid conscription. Whoever is willing to pay one gold tael. And can pick her up. Can take her away." If they can't pick her up. Then the one gold tael. Must be used as travel expenses for the old man. Although there were many onlookers. No one dared to try. There was a butcher. Who was very strong. The crowd encouraged him. Saying it would be good to marry her as a daughter-in-law. The butcher was happy. He rolled up his sleeves. From behind, he hugged her waist. But he couldn't pick her up. The girl just placed her hands on her knees. Squatting on the ground. The crowd was surprised and delighted. Applauding. The butcher was very ashamed. His face turned red. He paid the fee and left. Afterwards, he told people. The girl's feet seemed to have roots. Unable to move even a bit. He didn't know what supernatural power it was. This is what Mr. Xu witnessed that day. He told me about it in detail.</p>
<p>Meng comments that examples of this kind have existed throughout history. Not just one. A certain novel. I can't mention its name. Once recorded a father and daughter selling their skills. The father was old. The daughter was about twenty years old. Both were skilled in swords and horses. And they could move back and forth on ropes like flying. What was even stranger was that they stretched a rope across the river. The father danced with a knife on the rope. The daughter carried water and went against him. When they met. The daughter hung upside down to pass. As swift as a monkey. Other skills were also like this. Every skill made the audience gasp in surprise. On the day of their departure. They suddenly announced that it was tiring to have a grown-up daughter. Whoever could pick her up would marry her. Without needing a single cent. At that time, there was a martial arts candidate named Gu. A man of great strength. The string happened to break. And he was even more eager for the girl's beauty. He came forward to respond to the challenge. The father sat the girl in a chair made of straw. He ordered Gu to pick it up. Gu used all his strength to hold it. He felt an immeasurable weight. After a while. There was a loud bang. The chair's ring came off. But the girl remained sitting in the middle as before. Glancing at Gu and smiling. The father and the crowd. All came forward. Praising his ability. But in the end, they left with the girl. Not giving her to him. Therefore, I think the volume and weight of a person's body. Are very limited. Where does so much power come from? I can't help but have doubts. In a physics experiment. When glass plates are stacked. They cannot be lifted directly. The same is true for covering a flat wok lid on the surface of water. It is not the wok lid that has increased its strength. It is because the wok lid is tightly sealed with the water without any air. If you want to lift the lid. You also have to lift the water. Then it will take more effort. According to popular legend, when Gan Fengchi lay on his back. He asked people to tie his hands and feet and use a pole to lift him. He wouldn't move. Gradually, it increased to dozens of people. Then he would suddenly rise. The large mud blocks stuck to his back. Could be equal to his body. Isn't this comparable to the example of the wok lid sticking to the water? All of the above must be this kind. But I don't know how to make the soles of the feet. Even the bottom of the chair, etc. Is closely sealed to the ground without any air. This is still impossible without proper training. Mr. Xu also said. When the butcher couldn't pick up the girl. He hugged her body and swayed her from side to side. The father immediately stepped forward to stop him. Saying that he was only allowed to lift her straight up. He was not allowed to sway her.</p>

<h3>The Development of the Cotton Industry in 1920</h3>
<p>The cotton spinning industry in 1930 has once again transitioned from a path of progress to a state of decline. The reasons are numerous, but the general economic decline of the world, the unresolved domestic wars, and the incessant disturbances caused by the Communist bandits are the most important factors. The following is a brief description of the situation in 1930:</p>
<p>(A) Overview of the Cotton Spinning Industry</p>
<p>The Chinese cotton spinning industry, since the end of the European War, has been in a state of decline for about seven or eight years since the golden age. Bankruptcies of yarn mills have been repeatedly seen. By 1927, the situation gradually turned around. The May 30th Incident occurred in 1925, and the country was unified again. The declining Chinese yarn mills flourished again, and this trend became even stronger in 1929. There were frequent reports of increasing spindles and expansion. Entrepreneurs and investors also rose sharply. The prosperity of the situation was reminiscent of the golden age during the European War. However, the peaceful situation was shaken again in the second half of the year. By 1930, the situation became more serious. The war was prolonged to nine months, and the internal banditry continued to advance with the times. Investors hesitated. Furthermore, the exchange rate underwent drastic changes. The difference between gold and silver prices became even greater. The progress of new factories was halted, and even the expansion plans of old factories were hindered. The business situation of various factories was mostly difficult, and layoffs were frequently seen. At present, the total number of spindles in the country, including Chinese and foreign businesses, can be counted as 4,237,718, an increase of more than 70,000 compared to 1929. Japanese businesses accounted for the largest increase rate. The following is a list of the number of yarn spindles at the end of 1930:</p>
<p>Spindles Looms</p>
<p>Chinese Businesses 2,416,872 15,455</p>
<p>Japanese Businesses 1,651,616 13,367</p>
<p>British Businesses 169,228 1,900</p>
<p>Total 4,237,716 29,722</p>
<p>(B) Yarn and Cotton Market Conditions</p>
<p>With the increase in spindles, the production rate of the yarn market also increased accordingly. However, consumption was unable to keep pace with production due to the prolonged tension in the Northwest, the widespread war zones, and the rampant activities of the Communist bandits, which affected even remote rural areas. The monthly inventory was consistently above 100,000 bales. In the foreign market, the general economic decline and the gloomy atmosphere shrouded the world. The market prices of cotton yarn frequently fell, reaching the lowest prices seen in more than a decade. The decline was linear from January onwards. The cotton market was also sluggish due to the drastic reduction in American cotton consumption, falling from 17.5 cents to breaking the 10-cent mark by the end of the year. Indian cotton was also devalued and sold competitively due to the unstable domestic political situation, which further weakened the yarn market. However, the domestic cotton harvest was poor due to unfavorable weather conditions, and the sluggish situation was more moderate compared to the yarn market. The following is a further breakdown of the yarn and cotton market conditions:</p>
<p>(III) The Yarn Market Shows a Linear Decline</p>
<p>The yarn market in January was facing the Lunar New Year holiday, and spot sales were weak. However, futures trading was quite active. Initially, there was a period of decline due to the increase in yarn inventory. But the market stabilized due to the shrinking exchange rate, the activity in the cotton market, and the imminent implementation of new tariff rules, which would curb the import of foreign yarn. The market price at the end of the month was the highest peak of the year. In February, the market situation was weak due to the disastrous fall in the overseas market and the tight situation in the Northwest. The decline in spot prices was particularly severe. The spot market situation was relatively stable due to the continuous demand in inland Sichuan and the imminent arrival of the spring sales season. In March, news of the deteriorating situation and the weakening overseas market were frequently reported. The difficulty in stimulating customer sales made the pessimistic outlook more evident. Fortunately, there was a period of strong sales in the northern market, and the overseas market turned stable again, which slightly improved the market situation. However, due to the unfavorable environmental conditions, it was difficult to reverse the declining trend, and prices hovered between 52 and 53 taels. Recalling the price of 183 taels at this time last year, one could not help but feel a sense of vicissitude. In April, the sellers took delivery at the end of March in preparation for manipulating April, and prices once fell to 50 taels. However, the market rebounded to 52 or 53 taels due to the rebound in the foreign market and the calm attitude of the bulls. Business from the Yangtze River continued uninterrupted, which still maintained its stable position. In early May, the declining trend of April continued. The situation was still deteriorating, and three-grade yarn fell to 139 yuan and 9 jiao, the lowest since 1916. However, due to the exchange rate relationship, the combined price was still high, and the bulls pulled strongly, so it was not severely suppressed. In late May, the price of gold soared, and customer sales increased again. Guangdong took in 20,000 bales of spot goods, and morale was high. The sluggish yarn market moved towards a stable path forward. The yarn market in early June was purely dominated by the strength of gold prices. Spot sales also had a period of excitement, and the shorts panicked, approaching the 60-tael mark. Later, American cotton fell to 13 cents, and three-grade yarn fell sharply again to a new low price of 98 yuan. People were shocked. Spot sales were also very weak due to the turbulent situation and the increasingly tight news. The stable yarn market suddenly retreated to a sluggish and depressed position. At the end of the month, three-grade yarn entered the 100-yuan mark again, the lowest since the Republic of China. Japanese yarn sales to China were already profitable. The Nisshin and other companies ordered thousands of bales of 20-count Three Horse and Baolai yarn, with a combined price lower than Shanghai yarn. The yarn market suffered another heavy blow. In July, yarn mills reduced work or stopped night work. Spot sales improved slightly, so the decline turned to stability and stopped at 8 taels. In fact, the situation was still turbulent, and the overseas market was still fluctuating. Although it was during the autumn sales season, spot sales only had continuous demand. In early August, the central army was successful, and morale was boosted. Spot sales were smooth again, once reaching 60 taels. However, the decline in American cotton prices was severe, falling from 13 cents to 11 cents. The banditry in the interior became more intense, and the attitudes of various talents were no longer as active as in early August. During this autumn sales season, spot sales were sluggish, and the market was weak. The Chao gang was selling aggressively. Fortunately, the major buyers were calm, and there was no severe decline. However, the signs of weakness became more and more obvious. In early September, the suffering from soldiers and bandits became more and more serious. Demand was quiet, and inventory increased sharply. Japanese yarn was again devalued and sold off, and the market situation became more and more weak, retreating to 50 taels. Later, the Northeast telegraphed peace, and the various gangs searched very diligently. The market situation quickly moved towards a stable situation. However, due to the collapse of the cotton market, the rising trend was suppressed, and prices hovered between 52 and 53 taels. In October, the market situation was still stable due to the news of peace from the previous month. But in fact, although the situation had been pacified, the attitudes of the various gangs were still depressed. The overseas cotton market had another setback, and the stable morale turned to disappointment again, and the declining trend reappeared. The reason was that this war had been going on for a long time, and the area was wide. Furthermore, the banditry was everywhere. The vitality of various places had been greatly lost, and recovery was not easy. The purchasing power was greatly reduced, and the seller's arrogance became more and more intense, and a low price of 46 taels was seen. In November, the market situation still tended towards a flat and depressed path. The end of the year was approaching, and customer sales were greatly reduced. Until the attitude of the firm buyers suddenly turned negative in late November, and there was a lot of liquidation. The declining trend became more and more intense. By the beginning of December, the decline was even more severe, falling sharply. Buyers completely gave up, and sold their own goods on the market. Major sellers also dumped heavily this month, and the trend became more and more weak, and a low price of 32.5 taels was seen. The price difference between the near-term and far-term even reached more than 8 taels. But the government abolished the transit tax and changed to collecting a unified tax on cotton yarn. The year-end accounting was postponed. In order to avoid the new tax, the customers absorbed the spot goods very eagerly. The market situation was active, and the reaction was very strong. Prices rose by dozens of taels in ten days, and the year ended with 45 taels and 1 qian. The changes in the yarn market in the past year have been as described above. The following is a list of the highest and lowest prices and the number of transactions for futures:</p>

<h3>Investigation of Shanghai Commodity Price Index</h3>
<p>Input, Output, and Wholesale Price Indexes Rise in Unison</p>
<p>Input Index Surges 8.8%, Reaching a New High</p>
<p>The National Tariff Commission recently released the Shanghai commodity price index, stating: "The Shanghai Input, Output, and Wholesale price indexes compiled by this Commission for January of the 20th year [of the Republic] have all risen sharply compared to the previous month. The input index soared, reaching a new high. The output and wholesale indexes rose slightly less, but still increased by 4% to 5%, which cannot be considered a minor fluctuation."</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Input Commodity Price Index for January was 238.8, a sharp increase of 8.8% compared to the previous month and 28.0% higher than the same month last year. The categorical indexes were affected by drastic changes in a small number of commodities. Fluctuations exceeding 5% in January were rare. The total index represents the overall trend of commodity prices. According to the law of large numbers, its changes should be more moderate than the categorical indexes. However, it has risen sharply, increasing by a significant 8.8% compared to the previous month. The main reason for this is the continuous increase in gold prices and the incessant shrinking of the foreign exchange market. Imports come from gold standard countries, and their settlement prices are all calculated in gold currency. It is noted that the average price of large bars in London suddenly fell to 13 shillings and 7/8 pence this month, a sharp decrease of 1 shilling and 5/16 pence from the previous month's average price of 15 shillings and 1/16 pence, reaching a new low. The impact on input commodity prices is undoubtedly significant. Secondly, the new import tariff implemented from the first day of this year also has a significant impact on input commodity prices. This can be seen from the sharp increase in the market prices of tobacco leaves, cigarettes, brandy, wine, condensed milk, woolen cloth, and other products this month compared to the previous month, ranging from 17% to 30%.</p>
<p>Category Year January, 20th Year December, 19th Year January, 19th Year</p>
<p>Raw Materials</p>
<p>Agricultural Products 250.3 215.7 219.7</p>

<p>Overall Average 238.8 219.5 186.5</p>
<p>(2) The Shanghai Output Commodity Price Index for January was 183.4, a 4.0% increase compared to the previous month and 4.5% higher than the same month last year. Among them, manufactured goods rose the most, reaching 9.7%, followed by raw materials, increasing by 2.1%, and then consumer goods, increasing by 1.1%.</p>

<p>Consumer Goods 214.3 212.0 168.8</p>
<p>Overall Average 183.4 176.3 175.5</p>
<p>(3) The Shanghai Wholesale Commodity Price Index for January was 187.7, 5.6% higher than the previous month and 10.7% higher than the same month last year. Categories with more foreign goods, such as other food items, metals, industrial supplies, and other goods, increased by 7.3% to 14.9% compared to the previous month. The remaining categories also rose in tandem. Only the grain category showed a unique trend, with the index being 0.1% lower than the previous month.</p>
<p>Category Year January, 20th Year December, 19th Year January, 19th Year</p>
<p>Grain 154.5 154.7 17.94</p>
<p>Other Food Items 199.0 185.5 172.7</p>
<p>Piece Goods and Their Raw Materials 160.9 154.9 151.2</p>
<p>Metals 226.0 209.9 189.3</p>
<p>Fuel 183.4 176.8 162.3</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Building Materials 176.7 170.8 150.7</p>
<p>Industrial Supplies 248.1 215.9 176.6</p>
<p>Other Goods 184.8 171.4 150.5</p>
<p>Average 198.3 183.7 160.0</p>
<p>Overall Average 187.7 177.7 169.6</p>
<p>The base period for the above three commodity price indexes is the second year of the Republic [1913]. This Commission has long planned to change the base period to the fifteenth year of the Republic [1926] and replace the old index with the new one. Now that commodity prices are soaring and the momentum is strong, the impact on the economy and society is significant. The new index is easier to compare, and its effectiveness is even greater. It should be actively implemented to meet the needs. Although the revision work has been in preparation for a long time, the procedures are complex and will take about two more months to complete. The old index will be compiled up to this month to save time, and this is declared together.</p>

<h3>A History of the Evolution of the British Automobile Industry</h3>
<p>Among the countries with advanced automobile industries in modern times, the American continent ranks first, followed by Great Britain. A retrospective look at its progress over the past thirty years, compared with other countries, is also an interesting matter. According to records, thirty years ago, the total number of various automobiles in the United Kingdom was less than three thousand, and the number of people engaged in automobile manufacturing was less than two thousand. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the automobile industry was still in its infancy. The general public regarded automobiles as luxury items for enjoyment and did not pay much attention to them. The terms "automobile speed record" and "endurance test," as we know them today, had not yet been created. As for the design of twelve-cylinder and sixteen-cylinder automobiles, and the amazing achievements of setting new records such as the "Golden Arrow," they were beyond the imagination of people at the time. Today, regardless of all the developments in the automobile industry, just in terms of the manpower required, it has reached more than two hundred thousand people per day. One can imagine the rapid growth of the industry. It is not only a source of wealth but also a form of relief for the unemployed.</p>
<p>To understand the progress of the British automobile industry, it is necessary to briefly describe the development process of advanced countries such as France and Germany. Although the current development of automobiles in the United Kingdom ranks second, its emergence was actually later than other countries. At that time, France had 2,897 automobiles, of which only 543 were used for industrial purposes. In 1895, automobiles were used for the first time in a competition from Paris to Bordeaux and back, a total of 744 miles. The winning car was crude in form and had no overhead valves or carburetor. It traveled on rough and uneven roads, averaging only 15 miles per hour. After 1896, the French automobile industry progressed extremely rapidly, and all industrial and commercial sectors became more developed as a result. Germany has always been known for its industry and has devoted all its attention to automobile research. Because it works with transportation and military experts to develop transportation methods, it has always spared no effort to innovate the world's transportation industry. Indeed, within seven years, great achievements were made. In 1907 alone, 27,026 automobiles were manufactured in one year, indicating the speed of development. As for the United States, in 1900, there were only 600 automobiles worth 1.29 million yuan. At that time, Henry Ford was still a young engineer who dreamed of making his ideal automobile. As a result, he became the world's largest automobile manufacturer. Detroit was a prosperous area for other industries. After thirty years of gathering automobile experts, it has become the center of today's automobile industry. Such development is beyond the reach of other countries. Thirty years ago, British automobile pioneers, seeing the prosperity of France through automobiles, were inspired to compete and began to manufacture automobiles. At the same time, countries around the world gradually realized the importance of automobiles and wanted to control the automobile industry to take the lead. This led to fierce competition, which also led to international competition for various automobile manufacturing raw materials, such as oil, rubber, steel, and hardware. This was the first stage of British automobile creation, and it has continued to progress ever since.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the beginning of 1900, countries competed to use large sums of money and full efforts for the automobile industry, hoping to win in foreign markets. Automobile regulations were formulated to protect the domestic market, and generous rewards were given to experts who established new records for speed, durability, etc. The investment was almost countless. With such promotion and encouragement, the automobile transportation industry became increasingly developed, gradually competing with steamships and railways. Remote areas of the country were transformed into prosperous cities. These are all the achievements of the past thirty years. In the past, before the promulgation of regulations, the development of automobiles was often hindered. From 1896 to 1904, the weight and load capacity of automobiles did not exceed three tons. As for trucks, they were even prohibited.</p>
<p>Around 1900, the Automobile Association of Great Britain and Ireland, now the Royal Automobile Club, organized automobile tours to encourage ambitious individuals. This was the beginning of automobile expeditions. At that time, many people participated enthusiastically, traveling to major towns and regions in Scotland. Wherever they went, they received a grand welcome from the locals. Because it was an unprecedented event, those who heard about it were amazed and wanted to feast their eyes. Businesses stopped in the city, and farmers stopped in the fields to watch. Even coal miners in the deep underground abandoned their excavation work to see this strange machine that used gasoline to be controlled by humans. During the welcome ceremony, banks and factories closed to participate. This shows that this important new machine of the twentieth century was deeply noticed by everyone. The automobile, as the only powerful tool for land transportation, can also give the public a clear trust and deep impression through this enthusiastic performance.</p>
<p>Since 1905, the number of automobiles in the United Kingdom has increased sevenfold compared to the past. Two years later, the production capacity of various manufacturing plants increased, and they could produce a thousand passenger and freight cars per month. By 1910, the annual output reached 14,000 vehicles. Ten years later, the total number of automobile manufacturing plants in England, Ireland, and Scotland reached eighty, employing more than 40,000 people. However, there was only one small factory in Ireland. Among them, thirty companies still use their old names and continue to operate. The rest have either closed down, merged with other factories, or expanded their organization and adopted new names. This is a general overview of the evolution of these factories. As for the production volume, there has been further growth in the past ten years. From 1922 to last year, the annual production has surged from 38,000 vehicles to more than 180,400 vehicles. This year's output may increase even more. The future development is still in full swing.</p>
<h3>The Use and Protection of Car Tires</h3>
<p>By Yue Shan</p>
<p>The value of car tires is quite high. Smaller ones cost dozens of taels each, while larger ones cost hundreds of taels. Apart from fuel, car tires account for a significant portion of automobile expenses. The lifespan of a tire depends entirely on the usage conditions. At a time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and tire prices are soaring, you should pay attention to this to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
<p>(1) Tire Installation: Tires are installed on steel rims. However, there are several procedures that should be observed during installation. The inside of the steel rim should not be painted because the paint often peels off after drying, causing rust to form immediately. This rust causes the rubber to adhere to the steel rim, making it difficult to remove. To avoid this problem, apply a small amount of graphite grease to the steel rim before installing the tire.</p>
<p>Before placing the inner tube inside the outer tire, make sure that the screw that fixes the valve is tightened. The internal parts of the valve should also be checked at the same time.</p>
<p>The inside of the outer tire must be clean. Any foreign objects should be removed. The fabric cords of the tire carcass should be intact and free of any breaks or impending breaks. Inflate the inner tube slightly before placing it inside the outer tire. This will prevent it from twisting or getting caught at the heel. Then, place the liner strip on top. The size of the liner strip should match the tire. Be careful when placing it to avoid folding it. After placing it properly, add a little more air. This will make it very easy to mount on the steel rim.</p>
<p>The round hole should be close to the inner tube, and the oval hole should be on the outside, touching the steel rim. If this is not done, the inner tube may be pinched. Then, check whether the tire bead is in full contact with the rolled edge of the steel rim.</p>
<p>After the tire is mounted, before fully inflating it, tie it around the circumference several times to help the tire seal tightly with the steel rim. After the air is fully inflated, install the valve cap, and it is ready for use.</p>
<p>(2) Load Capacity and Inflation Pressure: The purpose of using pneumatic tires is to make the entire car ride smoothly. The degree of smoothness depends entirely on the air pressure inside the tire. This pressure varies depending on the tire and is related to the load it can carry. It should not be too high or too low. When inflating the tire, follow the manufacturer's specified pressure gauge. Only by using this pressure can the tire's lifespan be extended. The numbers in the gauge are all derived from experience and are not randomly set, so pay attention to following them.</p>
<p>(3) Overloading and Underinflation: After a pneumatic tire reaches a certain inflation pressure, it can only carry a certain maximum weight. If the weight is less than this maximum number, and the degree of inflation matches the load, then the tire's lifespan will be very long. If the weight is greater than what the tire can carry, then even if it is fully inflated, its bending and vibration amplitude will gradually increase, eventually leading to excessive stress. The result will be the same as the damage caused by underinflation.</p>
<p>In both of these situations, the tire carcass is subjected to excessive work. The fabric cords gradually weaken and will soon be unusable. When the overload is more severe and the underinflation is more pronounced, the tire's lifespan will be even shorter.</p>
<p>The problem of overloading is that it makes the tire prone to punctures, cuts, and increased wear.</p>
<p>Inflating the tire beyond the required pressure often causes tire fatigue and is also not advisable.</p>
<p>If the load is too heavy, you must replace it with a larger tire. Never continue to use the original tire by simply inflating it more.</p>
<p>When underinflated, if you force the car to drive, the tire's edge and heel will definitely break. The less air, the more severe the damage will be. If you are driving a long distance, not only will the outer tire be useless, but the inner tube will also be damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p>The pressure inside the tire is related to the tire's lifespan, so it is important to maintain an appropriate and constant level and not allow it to change.</p>
<p>(4) Tire Damage: (A) Abrasion of the Tread: The biggest cause is improper usage and bad road conditions. Misalignment of the wheels also makes the tread wear out easily. At this time, the part of the wheel that touches the ground is not on the plane of rotation, which will inevitably force the tread to rub on the ground. This problem often appears on the front wheels.</p>
<p>Wheels that wobble during rotation, misaligned steel rim centers, and other similar causes can cause uneven and rapid tire wear.</p>
<p>Excessive use of the brakes can damage the tread. When the wheels slip, the rubber is scraped off, leaving debris on the ground. Sudden acceleration also often scrapes off the rubber.</p>
<p>Roads that are damaged, under construction, or frozen and uneven are all formidable enemies of car tires. On excessively bumpy roads, the weight of each axle, which was originally evenly distributed over a large area, is now concentrated on the smallest protruding part, so the rubber is easily scraped off, and the tire carcass cords are also easily broken.</p>
<p>(B) Tire Carcass Delamination: That is, the separation between the tread and the fabric layers or between the fabric layers. The cause of this type of damage is overloading or underinflation, which causes excessive stress on various parts of the tire carcass. When separation first occurs, friction is generated between the two separated surfaces, generating heat. Soon, the entire separation occurs.</p>
<p>A tire with internal delamination will burst easily when heated. The inner tube also heats up at the same time, sometimes even causing the outer tire to burst first. Any unpatched cracks are quite dangerous if mud and dust enter through them. This often causes the tire to burst.</p>
<p>(C) Tire Carcass Cord Breakage: The biggest cause is underinflation or overloading, which causes excessive bending. If the tire suddenly hits a curb or a pothole in the road when the air is insufficient, the tire carcass cords can also break.</p>
<p>When the tire carcass cords are slightly broken but not too badly, they should be repaired immediately. Otherwise, the damage will expand too much and cannot be repaired.</p>
<p>(D) Outer Tire Bead Damage: That is, the part that hooks onto the steel rim is damaged. This is mostly caused by excessive bending and poor steel rims.</p>
<p>If the rolled part of the steel rim is not correct, then the tire cannot be properly mounted on it and will be cut immediately. When the rolled edge of the steel rim is pressed down or deformed, it should be repaired. It is best to replace it with a new one because a repaired steel rim is never as good as the original. Do not mount the tire on a rusty steel rim until the rust has been completely removed.</p>
<p>(E) Sidewall Abrasion: The rubber on the tire sidewall is used to protect the tire carcass from water erosion and side abrasion. Cars that travel on streets are easily damaged because they often rub heavily against the street curbs. On muddy roads or poorly maintained roads, as well as on frozen ruts, the tire sidewalls are subjected to extremely severe abrasion. To avoid this, you must be extra careful when driving on the roads mentioned above.</p>
<p>If the abrasion is too severe and the tire carcass is exposed, you should apply rubber again as soon as possible. Otherwise, prolonged exposure will damage the tire carcass.</p>
<p>(F) Tread Punctures and Tears: Tread tears are common to all tires, but they are more dangerous for pneumatic tires. The tears often gradually enlarge, containing foreign objects. The two torn blocks also often peel off. This peeling area makes it very easy for water to enter the tire carcass, which, if not repaired quickly, will cause corrosion and make the tire unusable.</p>
<p>(G) Inner Tube Punctures: This type of puncture is not entirely caused by weak rubber or other defects. When its size does not match the outer tire, such as being too long or too wide, folding inside the outer tire, causing it to be occasionally pinched, or being too narrow, causing excessive elongation after inflation, are all causes of punctures.</p>
<p>Using cheap inner tubes, that is, tires made of inferior materials, is not economical, unless they are used on old outer tires. It is not appropriate to install old inner tubes inside new outer tires.</p>
<p>Inner tube bursts are often caused by being pinched under the heel of the outer tire during installation. When the tire is soft, the heel moves, causing a burst. The inner tube occasionally comes into contact with a rusty steel rim, causing a tear or complete cut. In thick-edged outer tires, if it is not properly placed and is folded, it will also often break.</p>
<p>Inner tubes, like outer tires, will be damaged and unusable if you drive with insufficient air. Driving too fast, carrying too much weight, or having insufficient pressure will cause the temperature to rise very quickly. This kind of heat is very detrimental to durability, so you must pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(5) Secrets of Use and Protection: The high value of car tires has already been mentioned, so you must pay special attention when using them. The various points mentioned above are summarized below for reference.</p>
<p>(1) Check the degree of inflation inside the tire.</p>
<p>(2) Stop immediately when there is no air. (3) Check the alignment of the wheels. (4) Remember that lubricating oil, sunlight, fire, and heat are all causes of tire damage. (5) Spare tires should be wrapped and stored properly. (6) It is best not to use rusty or damaged steel rims. (7) Repair any small sidewall tears immediately. (8) Check the brakes to ensure that the force on each wheel is very even. (9) Avoid severe impacts. (10) Never exceed the weight that the tire can carry.</p>
<p>(11) Accelerate gradually when starting, and do not be too sudden.</p>

<h3>British Campbell Breaks World Automobile Speed Record</h3>
<p>By Pei</p>
<p>Driving at 245 Miles Per Hour</p>
<p>British famous automobile driver, Captain Malcolm Campbell, drove his unparalleled "Blue Bird" car at Daytona Beach on the 6th of this month, traveling at 245 miles per hour, establishing a world automobile speed record that had never been achieved before. Campbell claimed that he would no longer conduct automobile speed tests from now on.</p>
<p>Captain Campbell also drove an Austin "Seven" car, traveling at 94.06 miles per hour, which is also a new record in the automotive world. On February 5, Campbell drove his 1,400 horsepower "Blue Bird" car, traveling at 246 miles per hour, twice in a row. Then, Campbell jumped into an Austin "Seven" car, hoping to break the mid-sized automobile record of 45 cubic inches, proving that "British-made cars, regardless of size, are the best in the world." Campbell's results were not good on the first day of testing. On the second day, February 6, he made two more runs, and then he was successful. The first time he drove the small Austin, he traveled at 94.061 miles, and the second time he traveled at 93.994 miles. These records are all unprecedented.</p>
<p>British automobile driving experts and mechanical experts greatly admired Captain Campbell's 246 miles per hour record. Anyone who has witnessed the "Blue Bird" car claims that the speed of this car can still be increased. The "Blue Bird" car driven by Campbell this time is not only superior in its materials and manufacturing engineering, but also its design is based on various experiences.</p>
<p>According to Captain Campbell, he will not only surpass his own new record again, but if anyone else can break it, he will also try it. According to Mrs. Campbell, she hopes that her husband is satisfied with this record and will no longer risk his life. Mrs. Campbell also said that the speed of her husband's car is so fast that it is almost impossible to catch with the eyes.</p>
<p>The British automobile industry believes that Captain Campbell's new record this time has broken the world's automobile speed record. It will not be overturned in a short time. In 1929, Sir Henry Segrave created a record of 231 miles per hour, which has not been broken. Now Captain Campbell has increased it by 14 miles and broken Segrave's record.</p>
<p>Since Captain Campbell set this new record, people have called him the "King of British Speed." He is very satisfied with this record, but the danger of this move is also unimaginable. If a tire were to break a few seconds after departure, Captain Campbell's life would be in danger.</p>
<p>Although Campbell is unwilling to conduct automobile speed tests again, he believes that the speed of this 1,400 horsepower "Blue Bird" car is not limited to this. 270 miles per hour is also within reach. Mrs. Campbell is happy that her husband has decided not to surpass his own record again.</p>
<h3>French Scientific and Artistic Delegation Will Tour Asia by Citroen</h3>
<p>According to the Far East Motor Company, the Chinese general agent of Citroen automobiles, it recently received a telegram from Mr. Haarbt, the Minister of Commerce of the French Citroen Factory, stating that the Oriental Science Association recently announced that the scientific and artistic expedition team, which has been preparing for two years, will depart soon. The members of the team include scientific experts, scholars, and artists. He also said that the Citroen factory has made a great contribution to the departure of the team and will provide specially made scientific Citroen automobiles to show off the team's grandeur. The materials selected for the vehicles are all of high quality and very suitable for modern science. The team will reach Beijing via Arabia, Persia, Turkestan, Gobi, and Ordos. From Beijing to Saigon, Annam, they will return home via western China, Luo Luo, Burma, British India, Persia, and Arabia. The estimated travel time is about eight months, with thirteen automobiles. The team has repeatedly won awards at various scientific societies. It is said that this trip is entrusted with various scientific missions.</p>
<p>When French President Doumergue and famous scientists such as Mr. Baishiqi observed the team's travel materials, they noticed a vehicle that looked very much like a 13th-century ancient Mongolian vehicle. (Xu)</p>

<h3>A Ripple of Happiness</h3>
<p>Yu Xi</p>
<p>After eating late-night wedding feast, it's customary to make a ruckus in the bridal chamber. When we rushed into the bridal chamber, it was already crowded with women. Some were standing on benches, others on tables, closely surrounding the bride, waiting for some of the best entertainment to happen.</p>
<p>My wife was also one of the women in the crowd. Eight or nine men entered with us, each with great interest. The bride and groom, who had just finished their "small night meal," saw us enter with such a display of force, knowing that some difficult demands would be placed on him. He wanted to slip away, but was held back forcefully. "Today you are the main character, how can you escape?"</p>
<p>We made many requests of the bride, which she all fulfilled. Finally, we wanted the bride and groom to perform the bow and kiss, to which the groom objected. He said, "This is a foreign custom. Why should Chinese people perform foreign customs? Even if we were to do it, only those who wear Western suits and speak English in universities are fit to do so. I won't do it..."</p>
<p>But no matter how sufficient his reasons were, or how firm his attitude, Xun had already dragged him down from the table. The groom resisted, using force, but the bride stood up. She was waiting for the groom's kiss...</p>
<p>The groom's mouth touched the bride's face.</p>
<p>The women clapped and laughed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the half-drunk Shao said to the crowd, "Now that the bride and groom's kiss has been performed, I propose that every married couple in this bridal chamber kiss each other in return!"</p>
<p>"Agreed! Shao goes first!" Xun, the women echoed. "First one then first one! Come, let me kiss your mouth!"</p>
<p>The women were even more interested in watching the stubbornness. Who knew?</p>
