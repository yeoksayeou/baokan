<p>自日軍暴行發生。瞬經半月。敵騎咆哮旭旗翻飛。東北三千萬同胞淪於敵人蹂躙。四百餘萬里版圖。爲强暴所破碎。遙望東北。狼烟匝地。惡氛障天。我人未盡死。國魂尙在於此都應抱必死之决心。共同奮鬥。以發揚我國魂。奪還我河山。</p>
<p>目前舉國人民。農工商學。擦掌磨拳。旦夕引領京粤。企盼早頒一致抗禦之對策。敵愾同仇。民氣正熾。今日之事。一言而决。惟抗日乃能救國。惟一致攘外。乃能救國。對内絶不容再有爭執。時至今日。危急存亡。間不容髮。國人除捐除一切猜疑。一切嫌怨。以摯誠之熱血。改過悔禍。共同奮起。一致對外而外。别無可説。如其有之。即無以對國。無以對民。</p>
<p>黨附於國。故須先救國。黨基爲民。尤應先救民。今國危民困。而猶齗齗於黨見之爭執。放棄其當前重大救國之工作。是爲以黨見誤國。以國殉黨見。國爲我全體民衆所共有。民衆决不坐視其沈淪。如有危害國脈者。我全國民衆當起而共棄之。</p>
<p>今日之事。有本三民主義决然而起。指示民衆。共趨於抗日救國之途者。即爲民衆之導師。即爲民衆所愛戴。萬目睽睽。毫釐勿失。如際此國家危急。猶齗齗於黨見之爭執而忘當前之國難者。則民心失矣。己將安依。國將亡矣。己又安附。國人於此。最應切實認清。</p>
<p>過去種種。譬如過去死。今後種種。譬如今後生。鐵騎咆哮。正爲喚醒我酣夢之警鐘。當前之外患。正爲我國家維新自强之動力。傳有言。「無敵國外患者國恒亡。」於此之時。我全體國民。應牢握此時機。急起奮鬥。黨政領袖爲民衆之代表。尤應站於民衆之前線。爲民先導。如有違背斯旨者。即爲放棄其職責。即爲我全國民衆所不容。</p>

<p>日人異想天開的中和國的論調上海商塲上有一句流行的俗話。呌做「不怕不識貨。只怕貨比貨。」冒牌生意是一種最卑劣無恥的把戲。我們要立刻把黑幕揭穿。免得大上其當。國際上也有所謂假冒舉動。也要同様的注意。日本人在東北人面獸心。窮兇極惡的様子。久已司空見慣。這一次霹靂一聲。轟動世界。又冒了天下之大不韙。現在世界的輿論。都説日本萬分無理。日本人也曉得自己是理屈辭窮。有些不好硬幹下去。於是異恕天開。製造出一個所謂中和國的假面具。出來鬼混。日本人是目無中國的。並不是對中國有所顧忌。只是想用假面具來掩盡天下的耳目。令世界各國莫明其妙。將來就可以弄假成眞。脱胎換骨。假使不把這種黑幕揭開。那所謂中和國開幕的日子。也就是東三省斷送的一天。東三省的形勢。眞算是中國的半壁江山。要是東北亡掉了。中國一定不能夠偏安苟活。勢必同歸於盡。所以東北一亡。中國亦亡。這就是日本人極陰險狠毒的鬼計。</p>
<p>有什麽事實可用來證明所謂中和國的成立就等於東三省之滅亡呢。因爲日本人對於這種假冒的把戲。是很有經騐的。方歐戰告終。勝利諸國。早想分割德土諸國的殖民地。爭奪之端已起。當時美國威爾遜總統提倡不割地的主張。閙得不能下台。五强國裡的日本就出來獻計。從前日本有一位湛深法理的什麽博士。做了什麽朝鮮委任統治論。後來朝鮮問題。不是就此解决了嗎。委任統治這個名辭體面得很。又正義又人道。巴黎和會居然採用起來。這是大戰後日本人得意之筆。事實上那些受任的强國。對於那些委任統治的區域。都視同他們的領土。老實不客氣。就是割地的變相罷了。現在日人所要運動成功的中和國者。旣然是位於他們軍事上絶對的優勢之下。暴力壓迫。何求而不得呢。民意可以强姦。代表可以冒充。那末所謂中和國者。當然成爲委任統治的狀態。剛才説的。委任統治等於割讓地。中和國又等於委任統治。其結果豈非由中國的領土一變而爲日本的領土了嗎。</p>
<p>有什麽事實可以斷定東三省是中國的半壁江山。東北一亡。中國就完了呢。這可以從天時地利人和三方面來觀察的。</p>
<p>（甲）天時　東北氣候大體乾燥。心身爽快。適於健康。冬季雖冷。但夏季温度偏高。雨亦較多。作物的發育因而良好。秋季又無狂風暴雨。年年幾無歉收之時。我們從東北可以經營稻出一節。就可以看出氣候上之天惠。但是一到打通路以西。就可以望見沙漠和駱駝。因爲東北雨澤。來自太平洋。從東到西。逐漸減少。以接於蒙古沙漠。所以東北是中國邊疆的唯一寳庫。天然環境尙在黃河流域以上。西北一帶。更是望塵莫及。</p>
<p>（乙）地利　東北的地形。複雜得很。像平原。邱陵地。山嶺地。以及崇山峻嶺。色色都全。平原生產大宗糧食。大豆一項。占了世界總額的六成以上。此外小麥高梁和包米等。不可勝計。總之東北生產能力。可養現時人口的二倍。邱陵地是主要礦產地帶。以瀋陽爲中心。煤礦。鐵礦。非金屬（除煤外）。和金屬（除鐵外）。密密層層的分佈着。眞是徧地黃金。山嶺地有偉大的森林。參天老樹。鬰鬰葱葱。又高山流水。亦可利用。鏡泊湖的瀑布。尤其是無窮的利源。此外沿海一帶。更有魚鹽之利。所以日本人曾經説道。現在日本每年從外國輸入的七萬萬元的原料物質。一旦得到東北。就可以予取予求。進可以戰。退可以守。在經濟上可以完全獨立。到那個時候中國就不能用經濟絶交的方法來懲創他們的暴行。這是何等重大的損失。</p>
<p>（丙）人和　東北農民都是山東一帶的移民。長途跋涉。飽經風霜。所以民氣勃勃。極爲可愛。據我們聽到的。這次萬寶山慘案。出事的前一天。日本領事曾在大樹底下。會見中國的農民。説是明天有二千軍隊要開來。要請中國農民都帶棺材來償命。但是中國農民聽了毫不畏縮。第二天都奮勇爭先的去抵抗了。所以後來哈爾濱有一批慰勞隊。送些肥皂和手巾給他們。説是我們中國人有臉。照這様的民族。似乎亡國之後。還有希望的。但事實上可以斷言决非如此。日本人喜歡殺人。成爲特性。是世界上最殘忍最鄙卑的民族。印度亡國之後。還能夠產生偉大的領袖人物。像甘地其人。英國人對于甘地。屢擒屢縱。總不肯害死他。英國人終于節節退讓了。這是英國民族的雅量。也是英國文明的光榮。日本人是不講人格的。是慘無人道的。像長春市政籌備處長周玉柄氏。在吉林頗著政聲。這次辦理萬寶山案。很有氣概。我們曾會見過。相信他是一個愛國男兒。日本人恨極了。據報上所載。周氏已被凌遲處死。全家滅絶。死得最慘。又像遼寗敎育廳長金靜　氏。現在也不知下落。此外的　。不可勝舉。都可以看出日本人的手段。要把中國的讀書種子。斬草除根。所謂股鑒不遠。就在旅大。現在旅大租借地的農民只知道有清國。而不知道有中華民國。又旅大附近。金復海蓋等縣。日本化也已經很厲害了。其原因由于中國的優秀份子。殺的殺了。死的死了。剩下來的。個個束手待斃。况且没有智識上的灌輸。敎育上的啟發。所以死氣沈沈。做了不識不知的唐虞時代的人民了。台灣就是這様被日本統治下來的。所謂「滿懷心腹事。盡在不言中。」當初確還有些心腹事。到後來連心腹事都忘掉了。</p>
<p>日本占領東北以後。每年可以增加七萬萬圓以上的財富。同時中國每年損失七萬萬圓以上的財富。經濟上相形之下。日本已佔了優勢。再在軍事地理上。日本也得到極大便利。朝發榆關。暮到天津。從前遼金元清屢次入關的舊案。勢必要再演一次。或者暫時割據了黃河流域。成爲新南北朝的形勢。北方的勢力愈强大。南方的勢力比較的也愈衰弱。到最後的地步。便會發生一次像崖山之役的慘案。中國的愛國志士。只有趨於投海而死的一條末路。從此以後。中國就永遠亡了。崖山之役以後。尙有明太祖的復興。而這次却是最後的一次了。這道理是非常明顯的。從前胡人入主中國。在文化上只是一個系統。像元代的耶律文正。清代的康熙帝。對於中國文化都有極深切的了解。甚至於傾佩到萬分。前代史家所稱的深仁厚澤。不是完全虚妄的。從前異族入主中國。無不是禮賢下士。所以先後同化於中國。而日本人之深惡痛絶的。就是這般中國的知識分子。到了知識分子一網打盡。中國不但是滅亡了。而且是亡絶了嗚呼。傷心慘目。有如是耶外國的著名學者。大多數是不能直接看中國書的。關於中國歷史的和地理的背景。大都不甚了了。容易爲片面宣傳所朦敝。對於現在所謂中和國的運動。也難免不被日人所欺。弄得莫明其妙。但是像俗話説的。「不怕不識貨。只怕貨比貨。」我們就想用貨比貨的方法。把東北在中國和世界的地位。簡單的分析一下。讓世界上的人都能夠識貨。讓大家都知道日本人「掛羊頭。賣狗肉」的詭技。</p>
<p>（一）與自由邦之比較　大戰以後。愛爾蘭已經脱離英國而獨立。稱爲自由邦。愛爾蘭獨立運動。已經有二百多年的歷史。百折不撓。犧牲極大。完全出於民族自决主義。因爲英愛二族。人種不同。宗敎不同。經濟狀况也不同。雖僅隔一海峽。面貎合神離不能相容。至於東北和内地各省。好比同倫敦和利物浦一様。是同胞的手足。絶對没有分離的可能性。</p>
<p>（二）與中立國的比較　現在世界上所謂中立國。只有瑞士一國。瑞士種族有德法意三派。所以語言是三種並行。其所以成爲一個國家。完全由於地理環境的勢力。因爲瑞士位於歐洲昻白山中。生活環境相同。有組織團體的需要。且爲公共抵禦對外侵略起見。團結愈益堅固。在二百年前。已成爲獨立的國家。瑞士在國際上是一個永久中立國。他的特點是不能從事攻擊的戰爭。雖然有這個缺點。瑞士仍是一個完全的主權國家。他不過是不用此權。並不是大權旁　。試問這種種條件。東北有一個具備的嗎。</p>
<p>（三）和緩衝國的比較　暹羅原是我國瀋屬。從十九世紀以來。法據安南。英呑緬甸。該國介於兩强殖民地之間。成爲緩衝的形勢。暹羅所以能夠獨立自强的緣故。主要的原因由於暹羅所有外國人最大的勢力、就是中國的僑胞。西洋人反無勢力。歐戰以後。連領事裁判權都取消了。暹羅人深深地感謝中國人的善意經營。並未絲毫受到中國人之侵略。所以素來相安。和洽無間。而暹羅政府可以專心致志的勵行新政。假使華僑也和東北日僑一様。並非是單純的營利的動機。而含有扶植勢力和侵略領土垢野心。那暹羅恐早已名存而實亡。試問今後在東北的日僑是否要把態度根本改變。欺誰乎。欺天乎。</p>
<p>（四）和自治民國的比較　日本人在東北處處是抄龔襲俄國的老文章。不過是變本加厲。後來居上。俄國的方法。是先把蒙古組織一個自治的民國。外表上成爲獨立狀態。其内幕各機關都有俄國人來充顧問。以實行其俄國化。將來合併也好。不合併也好。總之同中國是斷絶關係的了。現在所謂中和國的運動。就是要把東北變做第二個蒙古。我們把他們的假面具揭開來。一言以蔽之。就是上面所説的委任統治。實在就是割地。好像醫學上用一種痲藥來割裂中國的領土罷了。</p>
<p>中國和外國的國際關係。大概外國人所知道的太多。中國人所知道的太少。外國入是明知故犯。存心欺人。中國人却是大夢未覺。茫無頭緒。這個碩大的睡獅。雖然經過中法之戰。中日之戰。日俄之戰和歐洲大戰都有睡眼惺忪的一瞥。但忽然又沈沈睡去。以致一曝十寒。國家地位愈趨下流。現在中國的國勢。已經像老年人的痼疾。再不挽救。是無可救藥的了。像這次東北慘案及其連帶發生的日本人的鬼計。歐美人固然還有些莫明其妙。就使都明白了。也不能起中國於沈疴。致中國於健康。中國的病。不單是頭痛救頭的問題。是整個的民族的覺醒問題。睡獅不醒。國家必亡。所以總理以喚起民衆。爲救國之急務。要解决東北問題。必須解决中國問題。現在中國唯一的希望。只有希望年富力强的青年。元氣淋漓的青年。和思想純潔的青年。以全國大學生爲中堅喚醒全國民衆。來做無往不達的救國運動。青年是中華民族的生命所託。也是中國唯一的國寳。急起　　。國尙可救。望青年努力、</p>

<p>吉林各界人民現在絲毫無表示意思之自由、熙洽在日軍之下、改組省府、吉林人民萬不承認、但郵電俱被檢查、不能發表意見、現在街上若有四五人在一處同行、即爲日兵所驅逐、故集會更做不到、日軍所貼告示、設有人扯去其一小塊、即以妨害軍事行動論、而有性命之憂、日軍到吉雖未開火、但因搜索破軍衣、曾當街剌死人命、城廂内外、因種種小問題而被害者、曾有數起、日軍飛機到處飛行、隨意放槍擲彈、吉林城外不遠之鄕間有市集、鄕民聚者甚多、日機行經其地、見人多即開槍、擊死一鄕民、吉海路上受日機之害尤多、又截至二十八日止、日軍在吉者仍未撤、惟砲隊已撤回一大部分、只餘五門、騎兵則已撤去、</p>

<p>昨晨試飛　該機於昨晨、在龍華水上飛機塲舉行初次試飛、到塲除該處處長曾貽經氏、及該處各重要職員外、有海軍部航空處處長沈爕氏、及中國航空公司王助、中國航空公司董事西人佩林等十餘人、先由該處工人、將該機由製造處運至龍華中國航空公司前浦面試飛、由沈處長親自駕駛、於九時二十分起飛、在江面環繞一匝、即行離開水面、翺翔空中、約十五分鐘之久、始行安然降落水面、結果甚爲滿意、</p>
<p>機身一瞥　該機製造極爲堅固、各部動作、在空中及水面、均甚靈便、係水陸互換雙翼摺合式、可容二人、分前後兩座、有一百六十五匹馬力、每小時可飛九十里、高度在二千餘尺、水機滿載重量二千四百六十磅、陸機滿載重量二千二百五十磅、外漆白色、尾上繪有青天白日滿地紅國徽、色樣極爲美觀、</p>
<p>沈氏談話　據沈德爕處長語華東社記者云、現在軍政部及海軍方面、對於航空極力擴充、惟因限於經費、未能有迅速之發展、惟擴充空軍較海軍爲易、吾國海軍部現有飛機約數十架、除少數爲舶來品外、餘者均爲海軍製造飛機處、在馬尾所造、軍商兩用均可、成績殊不亞舶來品</p>

<p>親愛的國人。西方人有一句極普通的俚語。見人有卑怯的行爲。便稱这爲ＹｅＩＩｏｗ。這一個字在英文中原作「黃色。」與「卑怯」有甚麽關係。令人不解我思之重思之。便想出一個答案來了。他們本來看不起黃色人種。又見黃色人種多卑怯。因此就直截的稱卑怯爲ＹｅＩＩｏｗ·然而我敢决定。這黃色人種决不是指日本而言。他們以小小三島。一敗老大之我國。再敗强大的俄國。當年「祈戰死」的精神。何等勇烈。所以西人之稱卑怯爲ＹｅＩＩｏｗ。那一定是指我們大中華民國的四萬萬大國民而言了。這一次對於暴日的態度。就是ＹｏＩＩｏｗ到極點的明證。我國人思之重思之。能不痛心。</p>

<p>老和尙，我是戀戀這一二百年前的過去承平時代的，請胸大發慈悲，給我坐上這轉輪椅子實，現那十八世紀的中國罷」。「」居士要實現那過去承平，只須坐上椅子，便會躬逢其盛。但是，老僧有一言奉告，中國的種種失敗，有遠因，有近因；老僧請你去看遠因。你坐上椅子，便成了一二百年前的人物；你别昧了本性，你覺得有什麽不滿意的地方，你只須喊一聲無礙庵的和尙，老僧便可援你出那過去的環境。」</p>
<p>「一切遵依老和尙的指導。」</p>
<p>於是老和尙請那陶遲先生坐上了轉輪椅子，逆着地球自轉的方向，用手一推，這椅子便不絶的打轉。陶遲覺得昏天黑地，一切的一切都不見了，只聽得耳邊嗚嗚的風聲！待到靜止以後，睜眼看時，自己便成了十八世紀中國山東省的一名新秀才，也是姓陶名遲，年方一十六歲。出身雖然清貧；但是，累代書香，在濟南城中也有相當的榮譽</p>
<p>説也希奇！没有坐上轉輪椅的陶遲，是二十世紀新頭腦的陶遲；一經坐上轉輪椅的陶遲，是十八世紀舊頭腦的陶遲。在這時候，他抱定著書中三有主義；！書中自有千鍾粟書中自有黃金屋書中自有顏如玉而且，這個書字，是狹義的書，專指著四書，五經，以及科舉工具的八股試帖而言，其他一切有關經世之用的書籍，都是除外的，都是不屑一觀的，都是看了有礙於科舉進行的。至於，什麽呌做科學萬能，什麽呌做優勝劣敗，在陶遲没有坐上轉輪椅子的時候，很有一番深切的研究；一經倒轉年光，追上了十八世紀，陶遲的思想他跟著變換了！他只知科舉萬能，他只知考取功名的便是優勝，名落孫山的便是劣敗，其他，甚麽都不曉得；他是受過科舉的洗禮，他是八股文章的忠實信徒。</p>

<p>今天是九月廿二早晨、我們在走廊裏鍍來踱去、談着日本攻佔南滿的暴行、心中充滿了憤火、好像在那裏燃燒而澎漲的、忽然我們給上課鐘聲驚動了、便想到要去上第一課、了要去上懨懨無生氣的代數了、這是一個冷漠無感情的老先生敎的功課我們覺得很苦痛、必定要我們苦坐着、聽先生　調的聲音、念着代數方程式、而同時我們的心中却燃燒着中日事件、這是多麽矛盾的境地、這是多麽難受的境地、而我們却不得不監禁這麽一時、</p>
<p>正在這時候、遠遠地看見那近六十歲的老先生、在那面走來了、手裏拿着點名册和代數書、我們更加憤怒了、本來平常他的冷漠無情的様子、我們雖覺不贊成、但總憐他的老邁、而在今天竟變成深深的厭惡了、「傀儡」二字由一個同學的口中噴出、接着便是另一同學的一聲「老機械」、於是我們衝進敎室、挺直了身子坐着、拿發火而含怒的眼光、等待着先生、這眼光眞有一口把人呑下去的様子、眞的、在一瞬間、莫名其妙的、我們這老先生、變成了我們的大仇人了、</p>
<p>可是、在老先生剛進敎室門口的一刹那我們就微微的一震、他平常那呆滯僵木的様子没有了、竟可以説敏捷的、他三脚兩步、跳上講台、不再像往常一様、鄭重地捧起點名册子、却是他那瞌睡似的、羞澀得永遠不敢向我們注視的眼睛突然豁的張大了、眼珠流動光莣四射顯然的、在一瞬間、他已鋭利地看徧了一個個的學生、這是什麽景象啊、我們的神經緊張起來、覺得定要有什麽事發生了、　　他手裏拿着代數書、身子在那裏抖動、越挕越利害、忽然「　」的一聲、他把那書放在桌上、接着好像「咧啦啦」一陣響、他喊出「同胞」二字這對於我們是一個突然的襲擊、我們覺得屋子似乎在搖蕩起來、在神經混亂中、我們想到、這到底是不是先生的聲音、這是可能的麽、那本來帶着泥土氣息的聲音、忽然變成這麽響朗了、好是我們仔細地看着他的嘴唇、他的嘴唇也在那裏顫動、喊道、「我國已到了危急的時候了······受了日人莫大的侮辱了······知道嗎、匹夫受辱、拔劍而起、况我四萬萬之衆、竟可受三島茺傖的狂暴嗎、······大好中華國土、斷不作日人耀武揚威之地、······奮門罷我同胞······要看一看到底公理會不會敗於强權、」</p>
<p>他的聲音斷續地、浪濤般在我們耳中洶湧着、他短促的聲音、竟迸發出這様長的一串呼喊、他的身體好像要爆裂起來、飛上天花板去、他的寛軟的寛軟的從没有紅色的面孔、現在竟緋紅而鼓漲了、他的給我們當作談話資料的光秃閃亮的額頭上汗珠直濺出來、在鮮紅的眼中、眼涙也在流着、這不是悲怯的眼涙、這是激奮的眼涙、這是勇收的眼涙、</p>
<p>心劇烈地震跳着我們也在流涙、深深地愧悔、痛責自已剛才不該對待他以含怒的目光、這目光是不能收回的了、但同時也流着快慰的眼涙、好像忽然重新得見了久已失落了的最親愛的人也好像陷敵境的孤軍、忽然救兵從天而降、我們是如何快慰、我們的先生原來並不是木偶我們是如何充滿了感激、我們先生的久已逝去了的青春之火、現在又燃燒着了我們的先生眞是重生了、</p>
<p>這時、先生急促的發「　　」聲的呼吸、我們也聽得出在模糊的涙眼中、我們看見先生鬢邊的白髮、給那從塲地上來的晨風、吹起一縷、我們也看見、先生瘦的胸部、在那寛大的長衫裏、很厲害的激動起伏着漸漸地氣喘起來、接着便是一陣咳嗽、</p>
<p>在我們中間發出一個親切的聲音　　「先生歇息一會罷吃力了」</p>
<p>「不你們不要看輕人你你不要差認我是老了、以爲我是不中用了、······我還很强健、很可以奮力、」</p>
<p>説着、他拍拍他的枯瘦聳起的肩頭、發出「咭咯」的聲響、他緊握着二個拳頭、高聲地得覆着説、</p>
<p>我還很强健、很可以奮力、······」　　「而、且還有我們在着呢」</p>
<p>全敎室一齊響起來了、</p>
<p>請願　云人</p>
<p>風蕭蕭兮浦江寒</p>
<p>不達目的兮誓不還</p>
<p>一盞淡綠色的電燈、從這四圍白的壁上反射出强烈的光彩、因爲室小的緣故、更顯得明亮、寢室裏其餘的人都出去了、祇剩下一個孤單的我、在臥牀上輾轉、就是平時整個攘擾著的宿舍丨終日不絶的木鞋和地板的碰擊聲、某房的倒水聲、樂器聲、嘻笑聲······現在也好像都靜了下去没有一些聲息</p>
<p>外面刮著很大的風、降著沉重的雨、雨點打在窗上謖謖地作響、更增加室内的凄凉、病魔迫住我使我没有一些安適的時候、一切雜亂的思潮、又不絶地在我的腦海裏湧現、我想起前幾天當我們聽見倭奴侵入東省消息時候的義憤、同伴們冒著雨出發宣傳的熱烈的情景、全體同學受軍事訓練的嚴肅的態度······一件一件、瞬息間在我的頭腦裏變換、　　「搭搭、」房門上突然地敲兩下、我的思潮立刻打住了、我輕輕地仰起了頭、冀已現在我的眼前、他身上從肩到腰裏著一條氈子、手裏提著一隻小的皮籄、好像戰士開始他的遠征一般、</p>
<p>「你熱度退了些麽、」他看見了我、就這様地問、</p>
<p>「醫生下午已經來過、他説是寒熱、没有甚麽關係、現在我覺得比前好得多了、你到什麽地方去呀、」我懷疑似的問他、</p>
<p>「你不知道嗎、我們今晚立刻要全體出發到南京去請願了、」</p>
<p>「請願、」我似知非知的又問了一聲、因爲在白天裏我已聽見這様説過、「外面雨下得很大、你們怎様去呢、」我記起什麽事似的又加了一句、</p>
<p>「雨、那是不去管牠的了、就是有更大的阻礙、在這時候也是要幹的、」冀現出很决定的様子、</p>
<p>「那麽什麽時候回來呢、」我懶洋洋地問、</p>
<p>「歸期吧······我們現在正引吭著、風蕭蕭兮浦江寒、不達目的分誓不還、歸期恐怕······没有一定呢、」他説完以後、淡淡的一笑、</p>
<p>、「·······················」</p>
<p>冀沉默了、我也沉默、兩個人靜俏俏地對望著、突然冀從眼眶裏流下兩顆涙來、亮晶晶的發光、我的涙也隨著落了下來、</p>
<p>「我走了、再會吧、」冀的聲音在顫慄、</p>
<p>「再會、」</p>
<p>碰的門聲、冀的背影繼著就不見了、我的思潮於是就轉變到這方來了、我想他們懷著這様熱烈的情緒、爲了祖國的存亡請願、一定能滿意地回來、我又隱約地看見有無數的青年、帶著悲壯的胸懷、激昻的氣概、</p>
<p>突然遠遠地傳來了一片歌聲、牠是帶著雄偉和嚴肅、更隱約地辨出了字句、「···三···民···主···義···吾···黨···所···宗···（」我忘却了我是一個患病者、很迅速地坐了起來、但是頭、好似有莫大的重負壓著、勃勃地跳動、跳動得使我不得不又臥了下去、但是這雄莊的歌聲、像先前一般的繼續地傳來、將我的心房打動、不、我必須起來、於是我忍著痛、披上衣服、漸漸地移動到窗口、打開了窗、風是很大、雨無情地向我面上打來、分外的覺着冷、烏黑的天空、没有一些星星歌聲現在可以很明白的聽見了遠遠的在草地的那邊、微弱的燈光下也可以看見步伐的移動、在煤渣的路上發出整齊的音調、我希期著立刻加入他們的隊伍、一齊前進可是我不、我不能、病魔將我束縳住了、啊、這可恨的病魔、涙不知怎様的竟掛滿了我的兩顂、去了、我的同伴去了、他們將我孤獨地遺案在這裏、不久這步伐聲這歌聲、在轉灣的去處、漸漸地遠、糢糊、終至聽不見了、</p>
<p>「前進吧、勇士們、爲了你們的祖國、爲了你們的民族、前進吧、我在此遙遠地祝你們的成功、」我不由得這様地想、繼著深深地嘆了一口氣、</p>
<p>沉重地無知覺地我又倒在床上、　　全室又靜了起來、死般的周圍、没有些微聲息、祇有、祇有桌上的鐘、還是機械式的發出牠「滴得滴得」不耐煩的鳴聲、</p>

<p>— 邵冠華</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>一排排的抗日運動的熱情由北方傳到南方鶆、一排排的哭聲也由這熱情裏傳來、像是安靜的秋風、巳是不安靜的震動起來、這秋風、像是和平而漸漸的趨向於熱烈、由熱烈而趨向於激昻、如一隻受傷的狼在呌、如一隻安逸的虎子在呌、一隻睡着的獅子在呌、呌着動着站起來了、　　樹葉呢、本來是鎭靜的、現在也像要了秋風的暗示而震蕩起來、箭也似的射出來、反映着天增的紅日、</p>
<p>滬西乂大學的學生軍也像受着大自然的奮鬬性的暗示而爆發起來、起先含着聲的呼唱是漸漸减少了哭的意識了、起先含着退縮的意志已漸漸的前進起來、起先含着憂鬱的神氣的已漸漸熱烈起來、男往起來、</p>
<p>「勇往、前進、奮鬬、」我們滬西乂天學的學生軍是記憶着的、記憶着像比吃飯睡覺還重要的憶着、在散步時記憶着、在閒談時記憶着、在辯論時記憶着、在沉默時記憶着、在憂鬱時記憶着、在憤怒時記憶着、在靜坐時記憶着、在晚禱時記憶着、這「勇往、前進、奮鬬、」的六個字會在頽廢時跳躍起來、疲倦時震蕩起來、悲哀時狂呼起來、這「勇往、前進、奮鬬、」的六個字、在每個學生軍的腦袋裏會像毒蛇般的絞動起來捲動起來、</p>
<p>「巳往的國恥的縮影、不是我們個人靈魂上的黑點麽、不是我們整個的同胞們靈魂上的黑點麽、不是我們　　整個的民族上的黑點麽、這個黑點　　是我們應當割除的、摕掉的、用我們　　光輝的刀來割除它、用我們的槍來　　彈掉它、用我們的拳震碎它、用我們　　每人心靈上的熱血噴散它、這是我　　們的責任、全體民衆的責任、」</p>
<p>他們學生軍的心靈上都是這様的沉思着、鼓動着、</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>國旗在飄動了、</p>
<p>由各排的隊長的「整隊」口號的指導之下、每個學生軍由嚴肅的沉思裏立正起來、</p>
<p>他們都是穿着黃色的制服、結着綁腿布、各人整齊地執槍、看着站在右邊的同志的軍帽、凝視着、端正地站着、　　「開步走」、每隊隊長激昻地喊着、　　每個學生軍一絲不亂地跟着前面的走、他們在晨光的波動下映出年青的晨光來、一步向前走着、操塲上除了「達、達、達」的步伐聲之外、什麽也聽不到、這個肅殺之氣震碎了沉寂、他們昻着頭、看着前面、一步步的走、着他們忘記了煩悶、忘記了憂鬱、忘記了悲哀忘記了家庭、祇記得他們自已是國民的一份子、他們應負起他們的責任來、</p>
<p>「立正、」各隊隊長嚴肅地喊着、　　每個學生軍都聽着命令站立着、</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>國旗在飄動了、</p>
<p>每隊隊長手執白布黑字的旗子、有的是「到南京國府去請願、」有的是「、寗在刀下死、不做亡國奴」有的是「奮鬬」、有的是「振作起來」、有的是「殺盡暴日」等字様、每一桿旗子上都表現熱情的意識、前進的意識那些字句是涙寫成的、那些字句是血寫成的、</p>
<p>各隊長命各鐆報數各隊、的人數是二十人、共計五十隊、他們都看着旗桿上的字句、看着、天看着雲、丨看着每個人的逵替熱血衝出的臉、看着生每個人震動憤怒的胸口、</p>
<p>他們一隊隊的向着北火車站去、　　四</p>
<p>他們步伐整齊地出發了、在路上、踏着塵灰、唱着歌、他們歌聲裏是鎭靜的、有條、理的在他們的、鎭靜的、有條理的歌聲裏、音調是悲莊的、激憤的、那歌曲、是各人靈感上的波動的呼聲、忽地高了起來、忽地低了下去、在風的飄動裏旋轉着、跳躍着忽地變成粗率的、狂暴的、如暴風急雨的海岸的潮水、他們不知不覺地已起到北火車站了、</p>
<p>他們忘記了疲倦、忘記了飢餓、他們感到現在的時刻正不容他們有這様的情緒、他們領會現在的時刻正僅容他們默思着自已的「使命」、這個不可遲緩的「使命、」</p>
<p>他們已跨上火車了、他們一隊隊地分坐着、他們想不到許多行人在喧嘩地批評他們、贊譽他們、他們想不到「生」和「死」之可喜可悲、他們想得的是那「勇往、前進、奮鬬、」的六個字、</p>

<h3 id="c159">日僑與菲列賓丘斌存 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>日本以土地狹小、而人口過剩、故不得不有向外發展之勢、日本爲謀解决其過剩的人口起見、因有所謂北進政策與南進政策、然而歐美諸國已將日僑擯出其國士之外了、日本有可伸展其長足者、惟有亞洲的一些地方而已、日本數十年來、處心積慮、謀侵佔我國的東北（滿洲）與南洋學島籌之熟矣、現在日本已實行出兵佔我瀋陽、各報業已揭穿其野心、本人茲所欲加以論述者、則爲日僑計劃收買菲列賓的陰謀、丨丨</p>
<p>根據菲列賓通訊、稱上月十八日所出版的菲列賓自由週報、載有珍藏十五年來的日僑擬以四萬萬日金收買菲島的重要文件、緣在一九一六年、日本名流岸清一博士等一行六十一人聯袂游菲備受歡迎、其時留菲日僑名流、與日本游菲名流等集議、起草呈文、致當時日本大隈首相、建議自日政府以日金四萬萬元、向美國購買菲島、不料其呈文之原稿、竟爲菲島一個愛國青年所得、該青年乃菲島日僑某團體執役的人、故能獲此原稿、他得此原稿後、即行投交與自由週報、並繕一份寄與當時菲島駐美委員計順氏、自由週報得該項文件後、一向秘不發表、近以納卯日僑問題、引起菲島各方面的注意、該報乃將此十五年前的文件發表、使民衆瞭然於日人對菲的侵犯、實已蓄意甚久、而非一朝一夕突如其來的事咧、現將日僑呈文的原稿、譯述如左、　　（一）遠東的形勢、</p>
<p>歐洲戰爭何、時結束及將來恢復和平的條件如何、我們均不敢預爲推測（譯者按、因其時歐戰正酣、故有是言）但德國必失其在遠東的聲勢則可斷言的、東半球的均勢局面、形成了新的趨向、俄國藉其長遠的鐵路、自固於北、英國得了印度與澳洲爲根據地、其形勢亦甚安全、斯兩國皆吾國（日本的同盟、（譯者按、其時俄國沙皇政府、猶未推倒、）目前均不致爲吾國之患、法國則致力經營其印度支那（安南）、也不足日本之患、祇美國所領的島嶼散佈於太平洋中、如檀香山、如菲列賓如甘姆將、來必與日本起了利害的衝突是無疑義倘任何大國與日本帝國起了爭執、若以中國問題爲起爭執的主因、則日本之唯一大敵當爲美國邇來美國國會中、對於日本嘗有不懷友善的表示、是其明證啦、</p>
<p>（二）中國問題</p>
<p>至於中國問題、在此歐戰期中、實給我們以發展在華權益的機會然因此也是足使美國的一般政定、肆其損害我們利益的陰謀况且我們向南洋發展、極易使美國人對於菲島的恐慌這種現象、不足爲奇蓋近來日美兩國間、因美國對於在太平洋的日僑待遇問題、發生極嚴重的爭執、尙幸這種爭執、未至决裂的時期、然已引起兩國間不少的疑忌與怨恨了、倘美政客反對日本的對華政策、肆其種種陰謀以圖破壞、其陰謀一經擴大了後兩國間還有何事端不可發生呢、况來日歐戰結束後無論其如何的結束、我們深信德國必利用美國鼓厲中國以反對日本、蓋大戰之後、德國决無能力再可直接干預遠東事務哪、</p>
<p>（四）維持和平的方法　　如果外交的眞諦在避免戰爭、那麽我們不當竭力設法以和平的方法、來解决日美兩國的爭端嗎日美間的起糾紛、實基於日本人口的激增日本人口、每年增加六十萬、（譯者按現時日本每年人口、增加一百三十萬、）必得個安挿的地方、美國地廣人稀、有需於日本的工人然美國工人有强有力的組織决心排斥日工、因此　佈政治的機關、以實行其計劃、我們深知美國聯邦的中央政府、不以爲　、惟美國各洲具有獨立的權力、州政府的所爲聯邦政府固無法以阻止之、我癜雖與美聯邦政府表同情、然仍不能放棄善待日僑與機會均等的要求的、在這種情勢之下、殊不易解救惟尙有解救的一線希望呵、</p>
<p>（四）菲島爲美國政爭的焦點　　美國自一八九八年佔領菲島後、菲島就成了美國政爭的焦點、美國如果久佔菲島、末免大背美人的風尙美國第一流的政治家如威爾遜等、已經力主放棄菲島了、此時美國政府由民主黨主持、威爾遜總統及其他民主黨要人、與共和黨少數的要人、均不以殖民政策爲是、而主張放棄其在遠東之屬地、美國所不需要而願意放棄者、或可爲解救日美邦交的關鍵、吧</p>
<p>（五）對首相的建議</p>
<p>我們欲向首相建議者無他、即欲由日本政府與美國政府磋商、以一定的價格、向美國購買菲島、分期還欵、並以日本汪再使日工赴美爲交換條件、此議如能實現則兩國間的一切糾紛、自然可告終止、美國因此得减少其「日人的負担」、日本因此得解救其「過剩的人口」、實一舉兩得、、兩國何樂而不爲呢</p>
<p>美國政界領袖、常能保持其公平心與對於他國的好感、近年來雖走上擴大領土的歧途、然最近民主黨選舉獲勝、主持政府大權、足見美國已轉回其固有的政治軌道了、</p>
<p>（六）對華商業問題　　美國地大物博、其出產品必需輸出國外銷售、中國就爲其主要市塲之一、試看美國在歐洲、並無尺寸領土、然仍能獲得商業上的勢力、是於美人已經知道其對華商業、並無須以菲島爲根據地、日本對華、早已主張保持其領土的完整、且决心遵照中國門戶開放主義、使各國均得在華享有機會均等的利益、所以美國放棄菲島、不致喪失其在亞洲大陸的商業發展、美國向以維持和平人道爲主旨、若堅欲佔據其處在遼遠的屬地、則必須引起他國的欵忌、而謂其於商業外、别有用心了、我們敢説明白事理的美人、决不以佔據菲島爲發展遠東商業的必要條件、美國如得相當報酬、必願放棄菲島以减輕其負担、須知美國正待相當的機會與理由、以便行將菲島放棄呢、</p>
<p>（七）菲島的價值</p>
<p>如果美或贊成我們的計劃、則菲島的價值究有若干、是應由負責磋商者周詳計算之然我們不妨先作一個估量、　　按美國與西班牙之戰、共費美金一萬三千萬元、當時美國所發之公債爲二萬萬元、年利三厘、然實際上戰時所費的金錢决不超過一萬三千萬元、戰後訂約、美國以美金二千萬元、向西班牙購得菲島、美國人佔領菲島之後美人又以七百萬金購得天主敎在菲的地產、以五百萬金修造嗎頭橋梁公路等、以四百萬金造岷埠的自來水池、</p>
<p>一九一零年美屬菲政府將敎會地產三十九萬七千海克脱之中、出售了十二萬三千六百八十海克脱與人民、（約計三分之一）、且一萬三千萬金的美西戰費、也非純爲征菲而用、蓋美西戰後、美國除得菲島外並得ｚｐｏｒｔｏｚｒｉｅｏ與古巴保護國啦、計菲島現有鐵路四百九十三英哩、日本向美購買、值價不過美金七千萬元、英鐵路之費在外、日本向美購買菲島、其總價當不超過日金四萬萬元、將來正式磋商時、還可得較廉的價格的、</p>
<p>（八）對日本的利益</p>
<p>日本如購得菲島、其利益不減於美國、菲島地位距離台灣僅六十二英哩而已故日本寳有購買之必要况南洋的ＣａｒｏＩｉｅｓ羣島、近已入於日本之手了、近年時局、實使日本有兩進之必要、我們治理台灣、博得全世界的稱頌羨慕、我們如得菲島、也必能以治台灣的方法來治菲島、行政的效率、實業的振展、土人的待遇、衛生的設備、必能一一與治台灣相同、菲島一旦給日本所得、則亞洲大陸的沿海就有一連絡的日本島嶼、爲之屏障、自北方的琉球羣島起、以迄於南方的ＣａｒｏＩｉｎｅｏ羣島止、然後中國的領土得以完整、保持東亞永久的和平也得以實現了、我們倘能鼓厲美人愛好公道與和平的本心、必可得美人的同情、蓋日美間一旦决裂、禍患之大、實難言喻的、我們現在雖領有南洋的ＣａｒｏＩｉｎｅｓ羣島、對美戰事、誠非難事、然何若費三四萬萬日金的鉅欵以佔領菲島的便黨呢、所得者土地、所夫者不過金錢而已、日本如能以和平的方法向美購買菲島、美日雙方、均受利益、豈不比較戰爭爲優嗎、</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>日僑似乎以爲僅費了三四萬萬元的日金、就可以從美國的手裏買到非列濱、若果可能、美國昔年何苦興師動衆、與西班牙爭佔菲、島軍事勝利了、又何苦以偌大數目的金錢、向西班牙購買菲島、及費鉅金、建設了菲島、美國爲金王的國家、恐怕賤視寒酸氣的日本的三四萬萬元的日金吧、</p>
<p>日僑的最妄謬者、爲「日本對華、早已主張其領土的完整、且决心遵照中國門戶開放主義、使各國均得在華享有機會均等的利益、」與「然後中國的領土得以完整、保持東亞永久的和平也得以實現了」的話、丨丨今日兵陷我瀋陽、不是英國法國或美國、也不是俄國、而是主張中華領國的完整的日本、破壞東亞永久的和平的、也非爲别國人、而是口口聲聲以保持東亞永久的和平的日本、滾爾的、我們中國還未淪爲殖民地、我們要我們的民族、自己站立起來、我們要封着爾們日美人的口喊「門戶開放、機會均等、」的口號、</p>
<p>末了、日本、日本日、以侵佔地人的土地爲能事、畢竟如果世界二次大戰起來、它日本這點小賭本的土地、恐怕也要擲在侵佔他人的土地的野心上呵、法將福煦</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Chinese here are currently discussing the important points regarding the Japanese troops occupying Shenyang and other cities and confiscating purchased aircraft, ammunition, and other war materials. Among the confiscated aircraft, several were from Britain, France, and Czechoslovakia. Representatives from the Skoda factory in Beiping of the three countries have protested to the Japanese military authorities in Shenyang. It is reported that they have received a reply stating that according to Article 53 of the military regulations, the Japanese troops had no choice but to confiscate the Chinese army's aircraft. According to Article 53, which is Article 53 of Section 3 of the 1907 Hague Convention, which specifically discusses land warfare, it only applies during wartime. It only applies after one of the two contracting countries has issued an ultimatum and formally declared war. Therefore, various Chinese circles here are currently discussing the actions of the Japanese in Geneva. The Japanese representative clearly announced that the Manchurian incident was not a war, but merely an occasional incident, while the Japanese military representative in Shenyang openly acted according to military regulations.

He also met with Special Diplomatic Committee members Song Ziwen, Dai Jitao, Yu Youren, Wu Tiecheng, and Li Shizeng and discussed the overall diplomatic policy, which consisted of three points: (1) Urge Japan to withdraw its troops quickly. (2) Return the occupied cities and restore the situation before the 18th. (3) Negotiate responsibility and compensation issues. Now the League of Nations Council has resolved to order Japan to withdraw its troops before the 14th, which is only ten days away. He hopes that Japan will abide by the resolution of the League of Nations and withdraw its troops on schedule to avoid losing international credibility. The League of Nations Council includes many powerful countries, and this resolution is a manifestation of the existence of justice. Although the United States and Russia are not included, the newspapers directly affiliated with the Moscow government have expressed deep dissatisfaction with Japan, saying that Japan is no different from robbing in broad daylight. Many American newspapers also do not approve of Japan's actions. Moreover, the consuls of various countries in China have gone to Shenyang to investigate and will find out the truth, and there will be a claim of justice. It is said that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will be personally responsible. Although the central government has the intention to rely on him, he can do his best for the country, whether he is in the government or not. The central government hopes that Deputy Zhang will go to Nanjing, but the north is extremely important for Northeast diplomacy and the security of North China, so it is feared that it will be difficult to make the trip.

<p>Japan Takes Advantage of the Danger and Wantonly Invades</p>
<p>Appealing for Justice and Maintaining Peace</p>
<p>London The General Federation of Chinese Organizations in Britain today issued a declaration requesting those who pay attention to Chinese affairs to express their public opinion, ordering the Japanese government to immediately withdraw its troops outside the occupied areas, compensate for losses, guarantee that there will be no more acts of coercion in the future, express regret, and punish the responsible military officers. The main points of the original text are as follows:</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of Manchuria violates justice and undermines international law. Since the Russo-Japanese War, Japan has been coveting Manchuria. After destroying Korea, it used its so-called special interests to develop its invasion plan outside the Sino-Korean border and rapidly advanced its invasion policy elsewhere in China. Japan had long planned to enter South Manchuria via Korea and Central China via Shandong, but due to the conflict of interests of foreigners, the plan to seize Shandong failed, so it concentrated on the north. Japan disregards reason and does not ask for reasons, occupying our land. China, in response, advocates peace. The reason for Japan's invasion of Manchuria is the killing of Nakamura and the destruction of railway tracks, but these are just masks for propaganda purposes. Japanese soldiers have long wanted to instigate incidents in order to use them as an excuse to invade Manchuria. Therefore, they incited Koreans in Korea to massacre Chinese people in order to provoke retaliatory actions by the Chinese in Manchuria and give Japan the opportunity to penetrate deep into Chinese territory. Japan believes that China's construction of railways and seaports in Manchuria will hinder the interests of the South Manchuria Railway. It does not know that Manchuria is large and rich and there is plenty of room for both China and Japan to operate without conflict, but Japan will never give up its path of aggression. Since the massacre in Korea did not create its opportunity, it made its own soldiers dismantle a section of the South Manchuria Railway and strongly accused the Chinese soldiers of doing so. In fact, the so-called destroyed route is within the protected area of the Japanese soldiers, which the Chinese soldiers could not enter. The Chinese army obeys the order not to resist, but the Japanese army bombarded undefended cities, massacred civilians, and injured women and children. It also used military aircraft to bomb trains carrying refugees, killing two passengers and injuring many people. There are currently 50,000 Japanese troops occupying Manchuria. Japan's actions in Manchuria are not only bullying China, but also ignoring the League of Nations and the world's countries that uphold international law. Japan is bullying China because China is suffering from severe floods and cannot save itself. It dares to despise the League of Nations because it knows that the League of Nations cannot impose any effective punishment on it. It dares to resist the world's major powers because it knows that they are trapped in economic problems and cannot focus on other matters. Japan's invasion of Manchuria will be the starting point of a world war, and the prestige of the League of Nations and international law, which can maintain the order of international society, will also be completely destroyed.

<p>(Nanjing) More than 2,000 of our compatriots living in Heihe have submitted a memorandum on their views on Japan, stating that all of our national people should adhere to the spirit of sacrifice and never make peace with the brutal Japanese, sever diplomatic relations, and, in a passive way, ensure that Japanese goods cannot be sold, which will greatly damage the economy. In an active way, since they have occupied Manchuria and Mongolia, defense will be even more difficult and their military strength will be unsustainable. We should use guerrilla tactics to attack in the gaps, they advance we retreat, they retreat we advance, making them exhausted. In this way, we will certainly make many sacrifices, and there will be many dangers for them as well. For us, it is legitimate defense, for them, it is a light start to hostilities. At that time, world opinion will certainly not be on their side, and the United States can give us assistance. At the same time, the Labour Party in their country and the uprising of the Koreans are all within expectations. In short, with this aspiration and determination, and with the fearless spirit of our late Premier, we should fight to the death with the brutal Japanese, and we will surely achieve final victory.

<h3 id="e36">When Will Unanimity Against Foreign Aggression Arrive? <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army's atrocities occurred, half a month has passed in an instant. Enemy cavalry roar and Japanese flags flutter. Thirty million compatriots in the Northeast have fallen under the enemy's trampling hooves. More than four million square miles of territory have been shattered by violence. Gazing into the distance at the Northeast, smoke signals cover the land, and a foul atmosphere obscures the sky. We are not all dead yet, and the national spirit still exists here. We should all embrace a resolution to die fighting, to promote our national spirit and reclaim our rivers and mountains.</p>
<p>Currently, the people of the whole country, farmers, merchants, students, are eager to take action, eagerly awaiting, morning and night, the central and Guangdong authorities to issue countermeasures for unified resistance. Enemy hatred and shared anger, the people's spirit is at its peak. Today's matter can be decided in one sentence: only resisting Japan can save the country, and only unanimous resistance to external aggression can save the country. Internal disputes must absolutely not be allowed to continue. At this moment, survival is at stake. There is no room for delay. The people of the country must cast aside all doubts and resentments, change their ways and repent of their mistakes with sincere, ardent blood, rise up together, and unite against foreign aggression. There is nothing else to say. If there were, there would be no way to face the country or the people.</p>
<p>The party is subordinate to the country, so it must first save the country. The party's foundation is the people, so it should especially save the people first. Now that the country is in danger and the people are suffering, yet they are still bickering over partisan disputes and abandoning the current major task of saving the country, this is misleading the country with partisan views, sacrificing the country for partisan views. The country is jointly owned by all our people, and the people will never sit idly by and watch it sink. If there are those who harm the national foundation, all the people of the country should rise up and abandon them together.</p>
<p>Today's matter requires those who resolutely rise up based on the Three Principles of the People and guide the people to the path of resisting Japan and saving the country to be the people's mentors and loved by the people. All eyes are watching, not missing a detail. If, at this time of national crisis, they are still bickering over partisan disputes and forgetting the current national crisis, they will lose the people's hearts. Where will they then rely? The country will perish. Where will they then attach themselves? The people of the country should most earnestly recognize this.</p>
<p>The past is like the past dead. The future is like the future born. The roar of iron cavalry is the alarm bell awakening us from our deep sleep. The current foreign troubles are the driving force for our national rejuvenation and self-strengthening. It is said that "a country without foreign enemies will always perish." At this time, all our citizens should firmly grasp this opportunity and rise up to fight. Party and government leaders, as representatives of the people, should especially stand on the front lines of the people and lead the way. Those who violate this intention are abandoning their responsibilities and will not be tolerated by all the people of the country.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Hunan Generals Send a Joint Telegram Declaring War on Japan <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Changsha) The generals in central Hunan jointly sent out a telegram to declare war on Japan. The original text is as follows: To the editors of various newspapers: We believe that China has been struck by heavenly misfortune, with banditry not yet quelled, followed by natural disasters, while the Japanese imperialists, based on their traditional and consistent continental policy, rejoice in our misfortune and take advantage of our peril, willing to be the leaders of aggression. Since the day of the September 18th Incident, they have dispatched troops to the Northeast, forcibly occupied our territory, massacred our compatriots, burned our government offices, and insulted our border officials. All kinds of tyrannical and violent actions have been fully exposed. The seriousness of the matter is by no means comparable to ordinary diplomatic issues. The only way to deal with it is to formally declare war, for there is no other way to save the nation. If our people's hearts are not yet completely dead, instead of emulating the Korean patriots, seeking to restore the country in the future, why not take advantage of the remaining breath and risk death to repay the country? The universe is vast and not entirely without justice. We must first have the determination to prefer to be shattered like jade, and then we will have countries that uphold justice and speak out for us. If we cannot swear to die ourselves, and yet want others to rescue us from death, there is no such thing in the world. I, Jian, await punishment on the battlefield and have a duty to defend the country. Holding spears and wearing armor, I will not hesitate to die ten thousand times. I humbly beg that our central government make a quick decision and implement a declaration of war against Japan. If we win the war, it will be enough to save the nation and the country from danger. Even if we unfortunately lose, it will forever leave glory to the nation and the country. Disaster is imminent, and there is no time to choose words. My sincere heart hopes to be carefully considered. Fourth Route Army Commander He Jian, Chief of Staff Liu Yinggu, Army Commander Liu Jianxu, Division Commanders Wang Dongyuan, Peng Weiren, Li Jue, Tao Guang, Chen Guangzhong, Chen Quzhen, Zhang Ying, and all officers and soldiers jointly kowtow with respect. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Hunan Provincial Chairman He Jian and all committee members sent a telegram to the central government yesterday, stating: Urgent to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government Chairman Chiang, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Premier of the Executive Yuan, President of the Legislative Yuan, President of the Judicial Yuan, President of the Examination Yuan, President of the Control Yuan, Deputy Commander Zhang in Beiping, and Commander-in-Chief He of the Nanchang Forward Command: The Japanese bandits have already occupied the eastern provinces and are plotting to invade the south. Upon hearing the news, we are filled with unparalleled grief and indignation. The Japanese bandits are suffering from internal strife and external isolation and are eager to appease their people through invasion and plunder and to demonstrate their power to the world. They also fear that our unification will be completed and that there will be no opportunity to take advantage of us. Therefore, taking advantage of the remnants of our communist bandits and the extreme cruelty of natural disasters, they act against reason and justice to achieve their aims. It is absolutely impossible to salvage the situation with the diplomatic methods of the past. Our country's appeal to the League of Nations and various friendly nations, so that the world community will know the truth, is a necessary step. However, putting meat into a tiger's mouth will not make it spit it out unless you grab its throat. The public discussions of the League of Nations cannot make the Japanese people feel fearful, but rather they will take the opportunity to make various excuses to delay the withdrawal of their troops. Even if they withdraw, we are only begging for mercy from the enemy, exposing all our weaknesses, like a foolish person inviting a bully into his home, destroying his family and treating him politely. Disaster will come soon. How can we have the face to stand as a nation in the world? Thinking of the consequences, carefully considering the situation, the only option today is war. There is no second option. The people and soldiers love their country and have long shared a common hatred. If we can defend against insults and save the country, the internal strife will cease. There is no need for further exhortation. Our war equipment is well-prepared, although not as good as Japan's, but we are holding on to every strategic point. The danger has not yet been completely lost. With reason on our side, we will be strong. In the distant past, Wu and Jin repelled the armies of Qian and Qin. More recently, Turkey resisted Greece. There are many examples of the weak defeating the strong. If we can stand on our own, the world will surely have those who uphold justice and provide assistance. If we issue an order immediately, mobilizing the whole country, arming everyone, dividing into teams for training, and rotating to go to war, using defense as offense, we can destroy Japan in ten years. How can we say that we will win? Jian, having been a soldier for half his life, is moved by righteous indignation. In addition to ordering all schools in this province to organize and train according to the Volunteer Army Education Outline, all people over the age of twenty will practice martial arts, and all cities and counties will compile registers of retired soldiers and investigate useful military supplies for the practical use of the country. In addition, we will organize National Salvation Lecture Groups to widely encourage the people and repeatedly warn them to advance calmly and not be impatient. The 4th Route Army, with 100,000 soldiers in its divisions, brigades, regiments, and police, can serve as the vanguard on the appointed day. Hunan Province has 300,000 retired soldiers who can be conscripted into the reserve force. After April, the number will increase fivefold. The survival of the nation depends on this one action. We humbly offer our sincere advice and hope that you will carefully consider and instruct us to comply. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Guangdong Continues Meeting After Receiving Telegram from Nanjing</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu and Li Wenfan Stop Before Departure</p>

On the evening of the 3rd, Chen suddenly received a telegram from Chiang, saying that the public announcement of his resignation on the 5th still needed to be delayed slightly, and asked to discuss with Guangdong comrades.

<p>The six conditions proposed by the Standing Committee, apart from the two that have already been mentioned in the previous telegram, are related to the control of military, political, and financial affairs, requiring a certain person to lead his troops to retreat to Wuhan and the organization of a unified government to adopt a democratic centralism system. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Yangjing, Huang Zhiwen, and Huang Yanzhen returned to the province on the 4th. Frontline officers are returning one after another to participate in the pacification conference. It is heard that after the 19th Route Army is transferred to Nanjing, Li Yangjing's troops will enter Jiangxi to fill the defense. Bai Chongxi, summoned by Li Zongren, departed from Guilin to Guangdong on the 3rd. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The meeting on the 2nd decided: 1. Chen Mingshu will return to Nanjing to report first, while Cai and Zhang will remain in Guangdong to consult with Guangdong at any time. 2. In order to show sincerity and to consult with key figures in Nanjing, Guangdong has specially appointed Li Wenfan as a representative to go to Nanjing with Chen Mingshu to make contact. 3. Once both sides agree on effective peace, a unification conference will be held in Shanghai. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Mingshu and Li Wenfan arrived in Hong Kong at noon on the 3rd. Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Chen Ce, Zhang Huichang, and Xiang Hanping arrived together. They arrived at 7 o'clock and went to Chen Lianbo's Nantang Restaurant for a banquet. After the banquet, Chen Mingshu visited Huang Shaoxiong and Zhang Fakui. Zhang wanted to stay in Hong Kong, but Huang received a telegram from Chen inviting him, and Huang returned to Hong Kong from Guilin on the 3rd. At that time, Chen, Huang, and Zhang discussed the situation in Guangxi for a long time, and a satisfactory solution had already been reached. Chen Mingshu returned to the Peninsula Hotel at 11 o'clock and was about to take the President Coolidge to Shanghai when he suddenly received a long-distance call from Zhang and Cai from the province, stating that Chiang had already replied by telegram with concrete solutions to various matters, and that Chen and Li's trip north could be suspended and that they would return to the province to discuss everything, etc. Therefore, Chen and Li returned to the province by early train on the morning of the 4th with Sun Ke. Deng Shizeng also traveled with them. Huang Jusu, under Chen Mingshu's orders, went to Shanghai early on the 4th. Chen Ce, Zhang Huichang, and Xiang Hanping returned to the province on the evening of the 4th.

(4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The draft telegram for the Nanjing-Guangdong peace talks was sent by Cai via telegram and consisted of two copies, one for Guangzhou's declaration of dissolution. The telegram concerning this side was considered to require modification of the wording, and in addition, the Guangdong side has proposed many other conditions in recent days, which is inconsistent with the original agreement before Cai, Zhang, and Chen went to Guangdong. Therefore, a limit was set yesterday and a reply was sent to Cai and Zhang. It is heard that Chen Mingshu has left Hong Kong and will arrive tomorrow. Chen is only participating in the negotiations and does not hold the title of representative. After Chen returns to Nanjing, he will report on the successive meetings in Guangzhou and transfer his department, Jiang Guangnai's division, to the Nanjing-Shanghai line to take over the defense. As for the Guangdong side's negotiations, they will still be presided over by Cai and Zhang, who will communicate at any time. (4th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Hu Hanmin said to others that peaceful unification is the most urgent requirement at present, but as long as it is beneficial to the party and the country, he will never hold any preconceived notions. Now that foreign insults are imminent, party and government authorities should not make too many changes. (4th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Japanese Government Attempts to Provide Financial Relief</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: Due to the spread of the anti-Japanese movement of the Chinese National Salvation Association and the UK's suspension of the gold standard, the pound's value plummeted, and Japanese trade with China and India has suffered heavy blows. As a result of yesterday's discussions between Finance Minister Inoue, Governor of the Bank of Japan Hijikata, and General Manager of Yokohama Specie Bank Oura, the Japanese government decided to provide financial relief to traders with China and India through the Bank of Japan and the Yokohama Specie Bank in the following ways: (1) For bills that have matured but cannot be delivered, the Yokohama Specie Bank may provide financial relief with the goods as collateral. (2) If the price is lower than the price when the invoice was issued due to the decline in the pound's value, the Yokohama Specie Bank will not require additional collateral. (3) It is customary to increase interest rates when swapping bills, but this time, due to the changes in the gold and silver ratio caused by the anti-Japanese movement and the decline in the pound's value, swapping must be done at the same interest rate. (4) If the Yokohama Specie Bank lacks relief funds, the Bank of Japan will provide support funds.</p>

<p>Liberal Party Shows Internal Divisions</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd: The Liberal Party previously intended to recognize tariffs, but its attitude suddenly became stronger shortly thereafter. Party leader George, who is currently ill in bed, does not approve of elections or tariffs. This is also one of the reasons why party members have suddenly changed their attitude. Acting party leader Samuel explained the situation to a joint meeting of directors of various Liberal Party organizations today. The meeting then passed a motion opposing the proposal for a general tariff, still advocating free trade, and expressing confidence in Samuel. After hearing this motion, Sir Simon, the most famous figure in the Liberal Party, told a Reuters interviewer that discussions on the election platform have almost reached the final stage. Many other Liberal Party members feel that the path that the nation should take is to trust the Prime Minister. For this reason, another organization has now been formed immediately. If so, there will be a major split within the Liberal Party. It is rumored that George is now planning to resign as party leader. The Conservative Party's opinion is also gradually strengthening, believing that a small number of Liberal Party members cannot be allowed to obstruct the policies of the National Government. Therefore, before Parliament adjourns on October 7, there may be major developments in the political situation.</p>

<p>The Japanese's Preposterous Theory of the Zhonghe State</p>
<p>There is a popular saying in the Shanghai business community: "Not afraid of not knowing the goods, only afraid of comparing goods." Counterfeit business is one of the most despicable and shameless tricks. We must immediately expose the secrets, so as to avoid being greatly deceived. There are also so-called counterfeit actions in the international community, and we must pay the same attention. The Japanese in the Northeast are inhuman and extremely vicious, which has long been commonplace. This time, it was a thunderclap that shocked the world. They have committed the greatest atrocity in the world. Now the world's public opinion says that Japan is completely unreasonable. The Japanese also know that they are at a loss for words and have some difficulty in continuing to be tough. So they opened up a strange idea and created a so-called Zhonghe State as a mask to fool people. The Japanese have no respect for China, not because they have any concerns about China, but just want to use a mask to cover up the eyes and ears of the world, so that all countries will be baffled. In the future, they can turn falsehood into truth and transform themselves. If this secret is not exposed, the opening day of the so-called Zhonghe State will be the day of the loss of the three eastern provinces. The situation of the three eastern provinces can be regarded as half of China's territory. If the Northeast is lost, China will certainly not be able to survive in peace. It is bound to perish together. Therefore, if the Northeast is lost, China will also be lost. This is the extremely sinister and vicious trick of the Japanese.</p>
<p>What facts can be used to prove that the establishment of the so-called Zhonghe State is equivalent to the destruction of the three eastern provinces? Because the Japanese have a lot of experience in this kind of counterfeiting tricks. At the end of the European War, the victorious countries had long wanted to divide the colonies of Germany and other countries. The dispute had already begun. At that time, US President Wilson advocated the idea of not ceding land, which made it impossible to step down. Japan, one of the five powers, came out to offer advice. In the past, Japan had a scholar who was well-versed in law and reason, who wrote a theory of Korean mandate governance. Later, wasn't the Korean problem solved in this way? The term "mandate governance" is very respectable, and it is also just and humane. The Paris Peace Conference actually adopted it. This was the Japanese's proudest stroke after the war. In fact, those powerful countries that were entrusted with the mandate regarded those areas under mandate as their own territories. They were not polite at all. It was just a disguised form of cession. Now, the Zhonghe State that the Japanese want to successfully promote is located under their absolute military superiority. What can't they get with violent oppression? Public opinion can be raped, and representatives can be impersonated. Then, the so-called Zhonghe State will certainly become a state under mandate governance. As I said just now, mandate governance is equal to cession of land, and Zhonghe State is equal to mandate governance. Isn't the result that China's territory is transformed into Japan's territory?</p>
<p>What facts can be used to determine that the three eastern provinces are half of China's territory? If the Northeast is lost, China will be finished? This can be observed from three aspects: weather, geography, and people.</p>
<p>(A) Weather: The climate in the Northeast is generally dry. The mind and body are refreshed and suitable for health. Although the winter is cold, the summer temperature is high and there is more rain. The development of crops is therefore good. There are no strong winds and rainstorms in autumn. There is almost no year of poor harvest. We can see the grace of the weather from the fact that we can grow rice in the Northeast. But once you get west of the Datong Road, you can see deserts and camels. Because the rain in the Northeast comes from the Pacific Ocean. It gradually decreases from east to west, connecting to the Mongolian desert. Therefore, the Northeast is the only treasure trove on the Chinese border. The natural environment is still above the Yellow River basin. The northwest region is even more out of reach.</p>
<p>(B) Geography: The terrain in the Northeast is very complex. There are plains, hills, mountain ranges, and towering mountains. Plains produce large amounts of grain. Soybeans account for more than 60% of the world's total. In addition, there are countless wheat, sorghum, and corn. In short, the production capacity of the Northeast can feed twice the current population. The hills are the main mineral production areas. Centered on Shenyang, coal mines, iron mines, non-metals (except coal), and metals (except iron) are densely distributed. It is truly gold everywhere. The mountains have great forests. Towering old trees are lush and green. There are also high mountains and flowing water, which can also be used. The waterfall of Jingpo Lake is especially an infinite source of benefits. In addition, along the coast, there are more benefits of fish and salt. Therefore, the Japanese once said that Japan now imports 700 million yuan of raw materials from foreign countries every year. Once they get the Northeast, they can get whatever they want. They can attack and defend. They can be completely independent economically. At that time, China will not be able to punish their atrocities by economic sanctions. This is a major loss.</p>
<p>(C) People: The farmers in the Northeast are all immigrants from Shandong. They have traveled long distances and endured hardships. Therefore, the people are full of vitality and extremely lovable. According to what we have heard, the day before the Wanbaoshan massacre, the Japanese consul met with Chinese farmers under a big tree and said that 2,000 troops would come tomorrow and asked the Chinese farmers to bring coffins to pay for their lives. But the Chinese farmers were not afraid at all. The next day, they bravely resisted. Therefore, later, a group of慰劳队 (comfort team) in Harbin sent them some soap and towels, saying that we Chinese have face. It seems that this kind of nation still has hope after the country is destroyed. But in fact, it can be asserted that this is not the case. The Japanese like to kill people. It has become a characteristic. They are the most cruel and despicable nation in the world. After India was destroyed, it was still able to produce great leaders, like Gandhi. The British repeatedly arrested and released Gandhi, and never wanted to kill him. The British finally retreated step by step. This is the magnanimity of the British nation and the glory of British civilization. The Japanese do not pay attention to personality. They are inhuman. Like Zhou Yuping, the head of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, who had a good reputation in Jilin. This time, he handled the Wanbaoshan case with great spirit. We have met him. I believe he is a patriotic man. The Japanese hate him very much. According to the newspaper, Zhou has been tortured to death and his whole family has been exterminated. He died the most tragically. Also, Jin Jingzhi, the director of the Liaoning Education Department, is now missing. There are countless others. It can be seen that the Japanese want to eradicate the Chinese intellectual seeds. The lessons of the past are not far away. They are in Lushun and Dalian. Now the farmers in the leased territory of Lushun and Dalian only know that there is the Qing Dynasty, but they do not know that there is the Republic of China. The Japanization of Jinzhou, Fuxian, Haicheng and other counties near Lushun and Dalian is already very serious. The reason is that the outstanding Chinese people have been killed. The rest are waiting to die. Moreover, there is no intellectual indoctrination or educational enlightenment. So they are lifeless and have become the people of the Tang and Yu era who do not know anything. This is how Taiwan was ruled by Japan. The so-called "full of heartfelt things, all in silence." At first, there were indeed some heartfelt things. Later, even the heartfelt things were forgotten.</p>
<p>After Japan occupied the Northeast, it can increase its wealth by more than 700 million yuan every year. At the same time, China loses more than 700 million yuan of wealth every year. Economically, Japan has taken the lead. In terms of military geography, Japan has also gained great convenience. They can start from Shanhaiguan in the morning and arrive in Tianjin in the evening. The old cases of the Liao, Jin, Yuan and Qing dynasties entering the Pass will inevitably be replayed once. Or they may temporarily occupy the Yellow River basin and become a new situation of the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The stronger the northern forces, the weaker the southern forces will be. In the end, there will be a tragic incident like the Battle of Yamen. The Chinese patriotic heroes can only choose to jump into the sea and die. From then on, China will be destroyed forever. After the Battle of Yamen, there was still the restoration of the Ming Taizu. But this time it is the last time. This reason is very obvious. In the past, the Hu people entered China and there was only one system in culture. Like Yelu Chucai in the Yuan Dynasty and Emperor Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty, they all had a very deep understanding of Chinese culture. They even admired it very much. The so-called deep benevolence and thick benefits mentioned by historians of previous generations are not completely false. In the past, foreign races entered China and all of them treated scholars with courtesy. Therefore, they were successively assimilated into China. What the Japanese hated most was these Chinese intellectuals. Once the intellectuals are wiped out, China will not only be destroyed, but also exterminated. Alas, it is sad and terrible. Most of the famous foreign scholars cannot read Chinese books directly. They do not know much about the historical and geographical background of China. They are easily blinded by one-sided propaganda. They cannot avoid being deceived by the Japanese about the current so-called Zhonghe State movement. They are baffled. But as the saying goes, "Not afraid of not knowing the goods, only afraid of comparing goods." We want to use the method of comparing goods to simply analyze the position of the Northeast in China and the world, so that people all over the world can know the goods and let everyone know the Japanese's trick of "hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat."</p>
<p>(1) Comparison with the Free State: After the war, Ireland has seceded from Britain and become independent, called the Free State. The Irish independence movement has a history of more than 200 years. It is unyielding and has made great sacrifices. It is completely based on the principle of national self-determination. Because the English and Irish races are different in race, religion, and economic conditions. Although they are only separated by a strait, they are incompatible with each other. As for the Northeast and the inland provinces, they are like London and Liverpool, which are brothers and sisters. There is absolutely no possibility of separation.</p>
<p>(2) Comparison with neutral countries: At present, the only neutral country in the world is Switzerland. Switzerland has three ethnic groups: German, French, and Italian. Therefore, there are three languages ​​in parallel. The reason why it became a country is entirely due to the influence of the geographical environment. Because Switzerland is located in the Alps in Europe, the living environment is the same. There is a need to organize groups. And for the sake of public resistance to foreign aggression, the unity is becoming more and more solid. It has become an independent country 200 years ago. Switzerland is a permanent neutral country in the international community. Its characteristic is that it cannot engage in offensive wars. Although it has this shortcoming, Switzerland is still a completely sovereign country. It just does not use this power, and it does not transfer the power. May I ask, does the Northeast have any of these conditions?</p>
<p>(3) Comparison with buffer states: Siam was originally under the jurisdiction of China. Since the 19th century, France occupied Annam and Britain occupied Myanmar. The country is located between the colonies of two powers and has become a buffer. The main reason why Siam can be independent and self-reliant is that the biggest force of all foreigners in Siam is the Chinese overseas Chinese. Westerners have no power at all. After the European War, even the consular jurisdiction was abolished. The Siamese are deeply grateful for the goodwill of the Chinese. They have not been invaded by the Chinese in the slightest. Therefore, they have always been at peace and harmonious. And the Siamese government can concentrate on implementing the new policies. If the overseas Chinese are also like the Japanese in the Northeast, and are not simply motivated by profit, but have the ambition to support forces and invade territory, then Siam may have long existed in name only. May I ask, will the Japanese in the Northeast fundamentally change their attitude in the future? Who are they deceiving? Are they deceiving the heavens?</p>
<p>(4) Comparison with autonomous republics: The Japanese in the Northeast are copying the old articles of Russia everywhere. However, they are intensifying and catching up later. The Russian method is to first organize Mongolia into an autonomous republic. On the surface, it becomes an independent state. The internal agencies are all staffed by Russians as advisors to implement their Russification. Whether they will merge in the future or not, in short, they will sever relations with China. The current so-called Zhonghe State movement is to turn the Northeast into a second Mongolia. We will expose their masks. In a nutshell, it is the mandate governance mentioned above. In fact, it is the cession of land. It is like using a kind of anesthetic in medicine to cut off China's territory.</p>
<p>The international relations between China and foreign countries, probably foreigners know too much and Chinese know too little. Foreigners are knowingly committing crimes and intend to deceive people. Chinese people are still unaware and have no clue. This huge sleeping lion, although it had a glimpse of sleepiness after the Sino-French War, the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and the European War, suddenly fell asleep again, resulting in a gradual decline in the status of the country. Now China's national strength is like a chronic disease of the elderly. If it is not saved, it is hopeless. Like this Northeast tragedy and the Japanese's tricks that followed, Europeans and Americans are still a little confused. Even if they all understand, they cannot lift China out of its chronic illness and make China healthy. China's disease is not just a matter of treating the head when it hurts. It is a problem of the awakening of the entire nation. If the sleeping lion does not wake up, the country will be destroyed. Therefore, the Prime Minister regards awakening the masses as an urgent task for saving the country. To solve the Northeast problem, we must solve the China problem. Now China's only hope is to hope that the young people who are rich in energy, the young people who are full of vitality, and the young people who have pure thoughts can awaken the national masses with the university students as the backbone to do a national salvation movement that will be successful everywhere. Youth is the life entrusted to the Chinese nation and is also China's only national treasure. Hurry up. The country can still be saved. Hope the young people work hard.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Course of the Changes in the Jilin Bureau Under the Control of the Japanese Army <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Described by Two Professors from Jilin</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The news that Jilin was reorganized into the so-called "Provisional Provincial Government" under the occupation of the Japanese army is not known in detail between Beijing and Tianjin. Yesterday, Professor Hu Tigan of Jilin University and Professor Jiang Songnian of the Women's Normal School, unable to withstand the stimulation, fled to Tianjin. According to the two gentlemen, this matter is extremely serious. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>On the 19th, Jilin learned that Shenyang and Changchun were occupied by the Japanese army. Acting Chairman and Chief of Staff Xi Qia convened a meeting of provincial committees. On the one hand, he contacted the Japanese consul, and on the other hand, he sent a telegram to the Changchun army not to resist. The garrison in Jilin also began to move out of the city. At this time, there was no news that the Japanese army was attacking Jilin. The Japanese residents in Jilin, including retired soldiers, sent a telegram urging the Japanese army to come to Jilin. The Japanese army notified on the morning of the 21st that they would arrive in Jilin, and then marched from the Jilin-Changchun Road, confiscating weapons along the way. They arrived in Jilin at 6 pm. Xi Qia first sent people to meet the Japanese army several stations away, and he waited at the station to greet them. After the Japanese army entered the city, they occupied various government offices and official silver houses, and put up seals. They were in chaos all night before they could handle it clearly. The next morning, Japanese Division Commander Domen told Xi Qia that although the Chinese army had moved out of the city, it was difficult to guarantee that there would be no accidents, so weapons must be confiscated. Xi Qia then ordered people to handle the confiscation of weapons, but they did not get them back that day, and the deadline was extended to noon on the 23rd. When the time came, they were confiscated. Xi Qia went to see Domen. Domen was suddenly furious and rebuked Xi, saying, "You have not done anything you were told to do. The number of guns confiscated is insufficient, and it was agreed to be completed by 12 o'clock, but you missed the time. Now there is nothing else to say. I have two conditions for you, whether you admit them or not." After speaking, he left the room, and several soldiers entered with guns pointing at Xi. After a short while, Domen entered again and forced him to admit it. Xi Qia reported the confiscation of weapons to the public, but did not mention the two conditions. On the 25th, Xi convened a meeting of various legal groups, and suddenly proposed the reorganization of the provincial government. The Japanese army was severely monitored at the meeting, so it was called a meeting, but no one spoke. That night, two kinds of notices were found on the streets. One was in the name of Xi Qia, the chief of staff of the Border Defense Command, saying that he was responsible for all public security. The other was for maintaining finance, and the person who issued it was the Governor's Office. On the 26th, the so-called outline of the organization of the Provisional Provincial Government was published. The two conditions that Domen forced Xi to admit, one was said to be the reorganization of the provincial government, and the other was said to be the dismissal and transfer of several officials. It is still unknown what happened.</p>
<p>The people of all circles in Jilin now have no freedom to express their opinions. Xi Qia reorganized the provincial government under the Japanese army. The people of Jilin will never admit it, but the post and telegraph are all checked and cannot express their opinions. Now, if there are four or five people walking together on the street, they will be driven away by Japanese soldiers. Therefore, it is even more impossible to hold meetings. If anyone tears off a small piece of the notices posted by the Japanese army, they will be regarded as hindering military operations and will be in danger of their lives. Although the Japanese army did not open fire when they arrived in Jilin, they once stabbed people to death on the street for searching for broken military uniforms. There have been several cases of people being killed inside and outside the city due to various small problems. Japanese military aircraft fly everywhere, firing guns and throwing bombs at will. There is a market not far from the city of Jilin in the countryside. Many villagers gather there. Japanese military aircraft fly over the area and fire at people when they see many people, killing a villager. The Jilin-Hailong Road has suffered even more from Japanese military aircraft. Also, as of the 28th, the Japanese army was still in Jilin, but most of the artillery had been withdrawn, leaving only five, and the cavalry had been withdrawn.</p>
<p>Hu and Jiang described the course of this matter in order to arouse the attention of the government and the national people. What they begged for was only one sentence: "Save Jilin quickly. The later it is, the more dangerous it will be."</p>
<p>Attached are the so-called outline of the organization of the Provisional Provincial Government and the changes of officials announced by Xi Qia as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It is for the matter of notification. It is hereby notified that, due to the current circumstances, in order to seek local security, the Jilin Provisional Provincial Government is temporarily established in the city of Jilin Province after a resolution of the meetings of various legal groups and agencies in the province, which shall have jurisdiction over civil affairs, military affairs, and supervision of judicial affairs, and shall be fully responsible and presided over by the head.

The Special District had been without a leader for many days. Zhang's return provided a leading figure. For the 25th, 26th, and 27th, heads of various organizations held consecutive meetings at the Governor-General's office and Zhang's residence. Emphasizing that maintaining public security and protecting the lives and property of foreigners are responsibilities that cannot be shirked, they convened a meeting on the 27th and decided to organize the "Special District Public Security Maintenance Council of the Eastern Provinces," with Zhang serving as its chairman. The members include Zhao Jinlin, Chief of Staff of the Railway Protection Army Command; Ding Chao, Commander of the Changsui Railway Protection Army; Wang Ruihua, Director of the Special Police Department; Zhang Houhuan, Director of the Railway Police Department; Zang Qifang, Director of the Land Bureau; Zhou Shouyi, Director of the Education Department; and Xu Zhen, Director of the Telephone Bureau. The office is located in the Governor-General's office. Yesterday, a proclamation was specially issued as follows: "In view of the current turbulent situation, this Governor-General, feeling deeply the need to protect the consulates and residents of friendly nations in Harbin and to maintain local security, returned to Harbin from Liaoning on September 24th. Regarding the issue of public security in the entire district, I have convened meetings with various organizations and groups for days, conducting thorough consideration and research. With unanimous agreement, it has been decided to establish the Special District Public Security Maintenance Council of the Eastern Provinces effective immediately, and this Governor-General has been publicly elected as Chairman. All administrative and public security matters will be managed and handled by this Council, which will bear all responsibilities. All merchants and residents of various countries residing in this district must be able to live and work in peace, without any fear or harm. This Council is officially announced to be established on September 27th, with its office located in the Governor-General's office. In addition to notifying the consulates of friendly nations, this proclamation is urgently issued to all merchants and residents of various countries and the Chinese people in this district, so that everyone is aware. Henceforth, everyone must live and work in peace, not listen to rumors, and not alarm each other. This Council will exert twelvefold efforts to maintain local security in this district. This is a solemn declaration." After the establishment of the Council, the first committee meeting was held, deciding that all stationed troops should temporarily retreat outside the city. The Maintenance Council will recruit a temporary police guard of 1,000 men, organized into five brigades, each brigade with four squads, led by Yu Jingtao, Dean of Academics of the Special District Police Academy, to maintain security inside and outside the city. All students of the Police Academy and police trained by the trainers will be incorporated. The future of Harbin's security can be viewed with optimism. However, Japanese residents continue to feign panic, and many have moved back to their country in recent days. On the evening of the 25th, bombs were discovered at the China-Japan Cultural Association in Nangang and the Library in Daoli, resonating throughout the city, causing considerable panic among the citizens. Police rushed to investigate and found that only the stone steps in front of the Cultural Association were damaged, and the library had only a pit blown in the courtyard. It was determined that the Japanese had pre-buried landmines to create terror so that the Japanese army could use it as an excuse to invade Harbin. As the perpetrators were not apprehended at the time, strict precautions were taken afterward in the areas where Japanese residents live to prevent them from employing this tactic again. Since the 25th, Japanese aircraft have flown from Changchun to Harbin for demonstrations three times, distributing leaflets in Japanese and Russian. The aircraft flew extremely low, causing great panic among the citizens. Commissioner Zhong Yuqi lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul today. The Japanese Consul has agreed to forward the protest to the Japanese army in Changchun to cease the arrival of aircraft. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Japanese Troops Trample the Northeast and the Soviet Union <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Ferocious Japanese Harbor Internal Discord</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is Poised to Take Advantage of the Situation</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Japanese sending troops to the Three Eastern Provinces has been brewing for a long time. Therefore, today's outbreak is not surprising. Regarding opinions within Japan, such as the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, behind which are warlords and capitalists, they are naturally the backbone of those who advocate for this matter. However, the Communist Party in Japan, democratic political idealists, and the Korean Independence Party also express strong agreement with this matter. Initially, we heard this with doubt, thinking it was not credible. Later, according to news from various places, we learned that it was indeed the case. The approval from the Communist Party in Japan and democratic political idealists has other intentions. They believe that a revolution in Japan cannot succeed without an international war. Considering past events, such as in Russia, Germany, and Austria, if the European war of 1914 had not broken out, then Wilhelm and Nicholas, etc., would still be dominating their countries to this day. Therefore, the Communist Party in Japan is also encouraging Japanese warlords to send troops. As for Japan sending troops to the Three Eastern Provinces, the country with the closest international relationship is undoubtedly Soviet Russia. Therefore, before the Japanese prepared their troops and departed, they repeatedly sent people to visit the Russian Consul and the Commander of the Far East to inquire about Soviet Russia's opinion on Japan sending troops to the Three Eastern Provinces. However, the Russians answered with "no opinion." The Japanese could not get to the point. They further asked what the purpose was for Soviet Russia's preparing its Far East military. The Russians remained evasive, but also hinted at considerable sympathy. Within the Russians, there are two points. First, they believe that to communize Asia, a Sino-Japanese war must first occur. This point coincides with the opinion of the Communist Party in Japan. Second, Soviet Russia is very clear about the situation in China, such as the military preparations and internal affairs of the Three Eastern Provinces. The past Sino-Russian disputes of previous years are still on their minds. Furthermore, it is currently during the Sino-Russian Conference. Therefore, they also hope that Japan will send troops, not only to use the troops of others to give the Chinese a major blow to eliminate the long-standing resentment from the 1929 Sino-Russian conflict, but also to suppress the Chinese representatives at the Sino-Russian Conference. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that Japan's sending troops is a well-executed strategy of using a borrowed knife to kill someone. However, since the Japanese repeatedly probed for Soviet Russia's opinion without success, they were still unable to set their minds at rest. They further sent the Japanese Consul in Harbin, Tahashi Chuichi, to travel to Chita, Boli, Vladivostok, and other places to carefully inspect Soviet Russia's military preparations in the Far East region and what actions the Russians might take. Tahashi Chuichi departed in early September. When he arrived in Vladivostok, it was the day the Japanese military's atrocities began. His return was after the Japanese had occupied Liaoning and Jilin, on September 22nd. However, although Tahashi went to the Russian-controlled Far East region for inspection, the secrecy of military equipment meant that he ultimately could not gain a comprehensive view while rushing around on a train. On the Russian side, since Japan has already sent troops, on the one hand, the aim of suppressing China at the Sino-Russian conference and teaching China a lesson has already been achieved. On the other hand, they believe that since the opportunity has arrived, it should not be easily let go. Therefore, the situation in Moscow is very tense. According to a dispatch from Moscow on September 25th, since the 20th, there have been continuous parades and speeches in Moscow and major Soviet cities, stating that the Russian people must overthrow Japanese imperialism and capitalism, and must avenge the hatred from the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 and Japan's sending troops to Siberia. At the same time, they expressed goodwill towards the Chinese, subtly implying whether Soviet Russia's help is needed, creating a situation similar to that after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. Therefore, Karakhan, an expert on the East, and cadres of the Red Army boarded a plane on September 24th to inspect the area around Chita and Boli. This is the current situation. The future development of the situation may even trigger a major war in Asia. (September 27th)</p>

<p>Changsha Dispatch: Various sectors of Hunan Province are making great efforts to carry out the anti-Japanese movement. In terms of the public, in addition to jointly establishing a National Salvation Volunteer Team and a Youth Iron Blood National Salvation Corps, they are also actively implementing economic severance. Chinese employees serving in Japanese Qing companies have all resigned. The education authorities now consider young students to be the basic force in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement.

If the words and deeds of the members violate the goals of resisting Japan and saving the country, they should correct each other; (3) National Salvation Volunteer Teams should be organized under the guidance of teachers and staff when necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Exuberant Response of Students Studying in Japan to Japanese Aggression <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Petitioning Ambassador Jiang for Travel Funds to Return Home</p>
<p>Exposing the Japanese Plot of Establishing a "China-Japan Cooperative State"</p>
<p>Osaka Dispatch: Since the danger to Sino-Japanese relations, many Chinese students studying in Japan have successively withdrawn from school and returned home. Most of those remaining are poor, government-funded students. Due to the widespread floods in their motherland this year, and because the Eastern Provinces have been occupied by Japan, government funding from both the north and the south has been uniformly suspended. Hundreds of government-funded students are penniless. Although they urgently want to return home, most are suffering from a lack of travel funds. On the 29th of this month, more than 400 people gathered at the Chinese Embassy in Azabu District, Tokyo, to petition Jiang Zuobin, requesting loans for travel funds to return home, requesting 30 yen per person for travel expenses. They also sent five representatives to meet with Ambassador Jiang to state the amount of their request. Ambassador Jiang said that at 30 yen per person, with 2,000 government-funded students in Tokyo, the total amount would require 60,000 yen in cash, which the embassy was unable to afford, and rejected the request. Thereupon, hundreds of students gathered inside the embassy became agitated and expressed dissatisfaction. Seeing this situation, Jiang personally delivered a speech, promising to prepare ship and train tickets for the students within three days and hand them over to the Liu Student Supervision Office. The students then expressed satisfaction and dispersed.</p>
<p>Since Japan forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces, Chinese students studying in Japan have been preparing to return home while announcing Japan's intention to invade Manchuria in order to awaken the nation. Yesterday, the Chinese Students' Association in Japan issued a letter to all overseas compatriots, stating that the Japanese cabinet bears the final mission of imperialism. Using the Wanbaoshan Incident as an excuse, it instigated Korean people to hate China. Using the murder of Nakamura as a fuse, it exaggerated the sound of coercion. Finally, it used the excuse of Chinese soldiers blowing up the railway to carry out the military occupation of our Three Eastern Provinces, and even changed the name to the so-called "China-Japan Cooperative State." Its so-called maintaining special rights and interests and resolving long-standing Sino-Japanese issues have proved its true intentions. Our only method to save ourselves from death is for us to rise up and save ourselves. We must unite and make our final struggle, awaken the people of the whole country, strive to fight, and immediately implement economic severance with Japan and declare war on Japan, etc. The resentment of the student community towards Japan is evident from this.

<h3 id="e71">Overseas Chinese Li Shizong of Wakayama Brutally Murdered <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Corpse Lies on the Side of the Road, No One Cares</p>
<p>News of Missing Overseas Chinese Heard Daily</p>
<p>Osaka Dispatch: Since the Japanese army occupied the Eastern Provinces, Japanese newspapers have been using counter-propaganda to fabricate news of the murder of Japanese residents in China in order to incite anti-Chinese sentiment among the Japanese and encourage them to use retaliatory measures against overseas Chinese. Therefore, overseas Chinese in Japan have suddenly become panicked. When going out, they must either disguise themselves as Japanese or their lives are in danger. Within a week, there have been as many as four cases of overseas Chinese being murdered. In addition to two victims in Tokyo, three days ago, an overseas Chinese man was found hanged in a pine forest under Osaka Prefecture. Without waiting for his relatives to go and collect the body, the Japanese cremated the body immediately, completely destroying the cause and course of the murder, making it impossible to investigate. News of missing overseas Chinese is being heard daily, and most of them are secretly killed by the Japanese. The night before yesterday (the 28th), Li Shizong, an overseas Chinese man from Wakayama (nicknamed Li Daizi, who ran a barber shop), went out to shop and did not return late at night. His colleagues suspected that he had stayed overnight at a friend's house, so they did not look for him. It was not until last night that Li's corpse was discovered by another overseas Chinese man, who immediately reported it to the local barber association. It was then confirmed that Li had been murdered. When reporters heard the news and went to investigate, Li's corpse was still lying on the side of the road, covered in wounds from Han knives and Japanese swords. His brain had been smashed with stones, and blood was everywhere, a horrible sight to behold. Even after the man was dead, several Japanese children were still throwing stones at him from time to time. When asked of the local Japanese police station how the case would be handled, the Japanese police replied that the murder of Chinese people was the result of Japanese people's grievances, and the government could not punish the murderers. As for the corpse, it must be cremated as soon as possible to prevent the spread of the plague, alas. (September 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">At the Same Time as Japan Occupies the Eastern Provinces, the Korean Revolution Appears Briefly and Fades Away <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Government Strictly Prohibits Newspapers from Publishing</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: During Japan's recent occupation of the Eastern Provinces, all three divisions of troops stationed in Korea were transferred to Liaoning and Jilin, etc. The security of the Korean territory relies only on a small number of troops and police to maintain it. On the 21st and 22nd of this month, large-scale riots similar to the anti-Chinese movement in July suddenly occurred in Seoul, Incheon, Pyongyang, and other places. Koreans from all over the country rose up and even massacred Japanese residents. It is estimated that more than 20 Japanese people were killed. The Japanese government, in order to address the move of Koreans disturbing the rear at this time of military aggression against China, as it would be unfavorable to both domestic and foreign affairs, swiftly dispatched military police to suppress the riots. They used machine guns to fire everywhere. The Koreans, who had no resistance, were naturally scattered like clouds blown by the wind. In an instant, the revolutionary movement completely failed. Afterward, the Japanese government strictly prohibited newspapers from publishing the news to prevent social unrest. The Korean independence movement has once again appeared briefly and faded away, which is truly regrettable. (September 29th)</p>

Wang had a nephew, Xu Youliang, who recently moved into Wang's residence. Yesterday morning (the 4th), after Wang got up, he suddenly discovered that Qin Li's bedroom door was wide open, and she was lying in bed with blood flowing from her mouth. She had been dead for a long time. The gold ring she wore on her finger was gone, and the items in the room were in disarray, obviously a case of murder for money.

<p>A Confucian Husband Commits Suicide by Smoking Opium Out of Fear of His Concubine: Bian Jingui, aged fifty-three, the owner of the Jinchang Cigarette and Sundries Store at No. 79 Xinlu outside Guangfu Gate, is a native of Baoying in Jiangbei. His wife, Zhu, had not given birth to any children. His beloved concubine, Xu, had a son named Guanbao, who is now sixteen years old. Recently, Xu's attitude suddenly changed. She often quarreled with Zhu and completely hid all the property in the house. The cash earned daily in the store was also taken away by her. Jingui, out of fear of her ferocity, dared to be angry but not to speak out and had to endure her actions. A few days ago, Bian, being in dire financial straits, intended to sell the store to the owner of the beef shop next door, stating that the price was 150 yuan. Unexpectedly, Xu learned of the matter and approached the beef shop owner, claiming that she would fight to the death. The matter was not concluded. Under duress, Jingui ingested three mace of raw opium the night before. The next day, his family discovered him and immediately sent him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, but the poisoning was too deep and could not be saved. He died. The nephew of the deceased, Bian Hongru, claiming that Xu had coerced his uncle to death, reported the matter to the local Public Security Second Branch with Zhu, requesting an investigation. The Wang Branch Chief dispatched the police to detain Xu and send her to the main bureau for interrogation. After the case occurred, the local neighborhood chief, Xi Zhiliang, reported it to the County Court, requesting an autopsy. Upon receiving the report, the Procuratorate sent Prosecutor Yang to the scene yesterday morning (the 4th) at 9:00 AM to conduct an autopsy according to the law. The autopsy determined that the death was indeed caused by poisoning before death. After the autopsy, the prosecutor ordered the deceased's family to prepare a coffin for the funeral. The wives and concubines of the deceased, Bian Zhu and Bian Xu, were also transferred by the Hua Public Security Bureau Chief to the County Court. At 4:00 PM, Prosecutor Yang held a court hearing to question them. As a result, Bian Zhu was ordered to return home, and Bian Xu was detained pending review.</p>

<p>Villagers Riot and the Public Office is Destroyed: This year's flood in this county is unusually severe. Recently, riotous events have been happening in various districts and townships daily. The day before yesterday, villagers in the first district engaged in rice grabbing in Ouqu. Fortunately, there was police suppression, so no disaster occurred. However, villagers in the tenth, eleventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth districts still believed that there was no hope for the autumn harvest. They gathered at the district office to request rent exemption and emergency relief. Although they were persuaded by the kind words of the district chiefs and the announcement issued by the county government, it was still ineffective. Yesterday (the 3rd), villagers in the thirteenth district gathered again, more than 2,000 people, and rushed into the district office, destroying the telephone first. Various official documents were also discarded and destroyed. That night, the district chief, Hu Yukun, sent someone to the city to report to the county government to request instructions. County Magistrate Tan, considering that the police force there was weak, specially requested the commander of the Weichu militia of the stationed Chang Security Army, to dispatch 30 infantrymen from the first battalion to garrison the Xiaowu City area. The Xiaowu City police were then dispatched to patrol and suppress the riot in various districts. A Robbery and Kidnapping Case Occurs in Luhe Town: In Luhe Town in the eastern part of this county, which borders Taicang, at about 2:30 AM on the 3rd, more than 50 pirates suddenly arrived, each wielding a quick gun and a flashlight. They entered the town from the Yangtze River mouth on three pirate ships, and placed sentries at both ends of the market. Then, they robbed the entire town. As a result, a total of 16 men, women, old, and young were kidnapped, including 13 who belonged to the Taicang border and 3 who belonged to the Yubei border, including Sun Erbao, and Zhang Hongbao and his wife, residents of Sizhou. There was also Sun Jinhai, who resisted the bandits during the robbery and was shot and killed by the bandits. After plundering their fill, the bandits sounded their guns, gathered, disembarked, and fled. During the robbery, the area had specially dispatched people to Dongzhang City and Dongzhou City to report to the police stationed there and to pursue and suppress them, but the bandits had already gone far.</p>

<p>Yi Zhen Hui Meeting on Accommodation Issues The Jiangbei Flood Relief Association (Yi Zhen Hui) held its sixth board meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of accommodating flood victims. The meeting was chaired by Leng Yuqiu. The following are the discussed matters: (1) It was resolved that the association's transportation boats would cease operations by the Double Tenth Festival, and refugee passes would also expire at the same time. All counties were to be notified to transport refugees as quickly as possible before the deadline. (2) After the shipping industry resumes its regular schedule, four ships should be reserved for the association's use in transporting relief goods. The regular schedules of each shipping company should still include the association's relief goods to various disaster areas. Hereafter, all agencies needing ships should directly contact the shipping association. (3) It was resolved to add two more shelters each in Dongtai and Yancheng, with a limit of accommodating 1,000 people each. One more shelter should be added in Taixian, also with a limit of 1,000 people. All shelters will use the name of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee. The original shelter in Zhenjiang will still use the association's name, and another one will be added with a limit of accommodating 3,000 people, using the name of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee Zhenjiang Shelter. (4) It was resolved that according to the report from Yixing investigator Yang Gongya, there are many refugees scattered in the area without shelter or food, and the water has receded significantly. Given the short window of opportunity, for the sake of current relief efforts, the association will remit 1,000 silver dollars to the chairman of the Yixing Flood Relief Association, requesting them to consider the situation and provide food and lodging or just food, to aid in relief efforts.</p>

<p>Bandits Actually Use Small Boat to Kidnap Victim Zang Tuzu, who runs the Wanhe rice shop and mill in Wantou Town and lives in Shijiazhuang across the river, was visited by a group of bandits at 10 PM on the second night. They came by small boat, rushed into his house, looted everything, and kidnapped his fourth son, Chengru. They then boarded the original boat and left. Anti-Japanese Association Investigates and Discovers Illegally Imported Japanese Goods The Jiangdu County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, based on a letter from Zhenjiang reporting that cloth stores such as Yukang, Daren, Mayuanxing, and Tongtaicheng in Yangzhou had ordered a large batch of Japanese goods from Zhenjiang Zhenhe and other treacherous merchants to be transported to Yangzhou, dispatched all its staff, including Standing Committee members Wu Zunyi and others, to investigate near these stores. Committee member Wu, Secretary-General Hu, County Rectification Committee member Chen Shouyan, and Provincial Junior Army Corps Leader Ye Yangyuan led the Junior Army to investigate outside Fuyun Gate.

<p>Forced Death Case Occurs in Nan Yan Town Zheng Qiuyan, who runs the Hengchun Lime Shop in Nanyan Town, ordered his live-in granddaughter Chen Yubao (18 years old) to wash his water pipe the other day. Yubao accidentally dropped the pipe head into the river. Qiuyan severely threatened Yubao and ordered her to retrieve it. Yubao, being young, went to the riverbank with tears in her eyes to retrieve it. The water was deep and the current was rapid. After several hours, she still could not find it. The next day, Qiuyan roared at her again. Yubao, with tears in her eyes, went upstairs and hanged herself out of sorrow and indignation. By the time the family noticed, she had already died.

<p>Fang Ce Comes to Yong to Inspect Forts After the provincial government received a report from the Yongjia County Magistrate stating that a Japanese destroyer, Take-class, had arrived in Wenzhou and was seen passing through Haimen towards Zhenhai, it dispatched provincial commissioner Fang Ce to Yong on the first day to go to the Zhenhai Fortress Headquarters to inspect the forts. He also met with Sun Xingyuan, the Fortress Commander, and Wang Wenhan, the Water Police Bureau Chief, to discuss defense matters. He arrived in Yong at 5 PM yesterday on the Tai'an warship. According to Commissioner Fang, the Japanese warship has not been found in Zhenhai. If Japanese warships do come, since China and Japan have not severed diplomatic relations, our officials should treat them with the courtesy due to friendly nations. The mission of the Japanese Take-class warship, which reportedly has the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Korean Army on board, is to inspect Japanese expatriates in various places. Although there are several Japanese expatriate families in Wenzhou, the sailors on the warship did not land, and their attitude was not unusual. Since there are no Japanese expatriates in Yong, there is no need for the Japanese warship to come to Yong.</p>
<p>Three Traitorous Merchants Paraded Through the Streets The Zhenhai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association investigated and discovered three treacherous merchants, Zhang Ayu, Sun Yuawan, and Zhu Guilin.

<p>Meeting Situation The Presidium of the meeting consisted of seven people: Pan Tang Guanyu, Lin Kecong, Yang Zheng Huichen, Wang Xiaoying, Lu Huimin, He Dinghua, and Shu Huizhen. The Master of Ceremonies was Wang Xiaoying, the Recorder was Jin Shiyin, the Chief Receptionist was Yang Jingyi, and the Secretaries were Zhao Wenqi and Zhao Gengdi, Fan Aiquan. City Party Department Representative Zhao Erchang, City Social Affairs Bureau Representative Rong Huiren, and Education Bureau Representative Zhou Shang provided guidance. Order at the meeting was maintained by the Fifth Police Brigade of the City Police Bureau and the Boy Scouts from Liangjiang Southeast Sports College.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Chairman Lin Kecong reported, "Today is the day when female compatriots of the entire city hold an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Meeting. It is also a time of life and death for our country. The number of attendees is so crowded, which shows that the women's circle of Shanghai still has solidarity. Let us quickly and thoroughly resist Japan and use the blood and heads of our 200 million female compatriots to fight to the death with the Japanese invaders. Japan's violence disregards China, which, in other words, disregards the world. If our country does not resist such rampant behavior, our country will inevitably be destroyed by Japan, and the world will become Japan's world. A female friend who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday said that after the Japanese soldiers arrived in Shenyang, they raped female students of Fengyong University. A female student who saw this threw a vase at the Japanese soldier, and the Japanese soldier immediately shot the female student to death. Sisters, what do you think after hearing this news? After Japan occupied our three northeastern provinces, it transported a large number of military supplies and warships to China, plotting the independence of the three northeastern provinces and interfering with our national salvation movement. Sisters, it is a dream for us to ask Japan to withdraw its troops. The League of Nations is unreliable; it is a group of imperialist plunderers. If we continue to hold a non-resistance policy, the country will soon be destroyed. Our 200 million female compatriots should all arm themselves and fight to the death with Japanese imperialism. Fellow compatriots, we should unite when the country is in trouble and face the national crisis together. We should use the method of 'sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall' to economically sever ties with Japan, firmly remember the word 'resolution,' and use the spirit of hard work and struggle to save the country."</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches (A) City Party Department Representative Zhao Erchang said, in brief, "Fellow compatriots, today is the Women's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Meeting. Everyone must remember why we want to resist Japan and save the country. Now our country is about to be destroyed. The 400 million compatriots of China must unite as one and fight to the death with the 60 million Japanese people in the three islands. For example, if 40 Chinese people fight 6 Japanese people, as long as we act in unison, we can always win. At the same time, I also hope that (1) schools will organize volunteer armies, (2) intensify military exercises, (3) resist Japan and strengthen our bodies, (4) resist Japan and learn military affairs, (5) resist Japan and unite our spirits, (6) resist Japan and strictly maintain order, (7) resist Japan and act in unison, (8) resist Japan and pay attention to learning, (9) resist Japan and increase our knowledge, (10) strikes cause learning to be abandoned, so we cannot save the country and resist Japan, (11) strikes make life difficult, so we cannot save the country and resist Japan, (12) strikes cause economic losses, so we cannot resist Japan and save the country, (13) students must work harder and wash away national humiliation, (14) workers must work harder and wash away national humiliation, (15) merchants must promote domestic goods and wash away national humiliation, (16) strict adherence to order shows the spirit of patriotism, (17) obeying discipline demonstrates the spirit of saving the country." (B) Education Department Representative Zhou Shang said, in brief, "Everyone, to resist Japan and save the country, we must do practical work, not just talk empty words. Everyone must recognize that the League of Nations is an imperialist organization and is unreliable. Our policy towards Japan is to treat the symptoms and not waste a single bullet internally, and not spend another bullet externally. We must concentrate our economic and military strength and prepare to fight Japan. The fundamental solution is to have a spirit of hard work and martial spirit, unite as one." Liu Wang Liming, Shu Huizhen, and others also gave speeches in succession.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Telegram from Representatives Going to Guangdong to Petition <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Hoping that the City's Compatriots Will Strongly Support Us</p>
<p>Hu Shuhua, Ye Huijun, and other representatives of various groups in this city who were sent to Guangdong to petition for peace, sent a telegram yesterday, which was forwarded by the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to all compatriots in the city: When the representatives set off from Shanghai, they were deeply grateful for the warm send-off by people from all walks of life. It is evident that the people share the same desire for peace and resistance to aggression. The representatives were entrusted by the people of the whole city, and their responsibility for petitioning in Guangdong is significant. They will, in the capacity of citizens, strive for unity. Only when we are united can we defeat the violent Japanese. The representatives are well aware that their words are of little consequence, and they may not be able to make a real difference. However, at this time of rampant enemy aggression and imminent crisis of survival, they can only cry in the Qin court and risk their lives to petition. They hope that all compatriots in the city will rise up and strongly support them. They are extremely hopeful. They will arrive in Hong Kong by boat on Monday morning, stay for a while, and then proceed to Guangdong. Hu Shuhua, Ye Huijun, Wang Hanliang, and Secretary Xue Guangqian, representatives of the people of Shanghai on their way to Guangdong to petition, kowtow.</p>

<p>Abandoning Grudges and Uniting to Overcome National Crisis</p>
<p>More than 100 party members in this city, including Zhang Junguang, telegraphed Nanjing and Guangdong yesterday with utmost urgency: To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, forwarded to Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Zhantang, Ju Juesheng, Dai Chuanxian, Ding Weifen, He Jingzhi, Zhu Yizhi, Li Renchao, Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, (Guangzhou) Tang Shaochuan, Wang Zhaoming, Xu Ruwei, Gu Xiangqin, Sun Zhesheng, Deng Zeru, Xiao Focheng, Li Wenfan, Chen Zhongfu, Chen Bonan, Li Delin, Bai Jiansheng, Zhang Wenhua, esteemed sirs: We respectfully recall that all of you are founding heroes of the nation and pillars of our party. In the past, due to differences in political views, you went your separate ways. Although it was unfortunate for the party and the country, we respected your pursuit of what you believed in. Junguang and others also followed different paths, holding the whip and following our own beliefs. We are willing to remain consistent from beginning to end, even unto death. However, the violent Japanese are trampling on our Eastern Provinces, and justice is being extinguished in the world. Without the combined strength of the whole country, how can we save ourselves from destruction? Democracy and the republic were created by our party. Yet, after several years of governing, we are almost becoming traitors to the country. Would the spirit of the Premier not weep bitterly beneath the nine springs? Junguang and others, as party members, witness the difficulties of the times and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we earnestly plead with all of you to abandon your grudges and unite to overcome the national crisis. On the one hand, concentrate your talents and wisdom to build the country; on the other hand, prepare for war against Japan and recover our lost territories.

<h3 id="e93">Kui Yanfang Responds to Letter from Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Huizhong Fish Company</p>
<p>Has Never Imported Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Kui Yanfang responded to the letter from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday, stating: In response, yesterday I received your letter encouraging me with the great cause of patriotism, which I read with awe. Even if I am foolish, how can I not know this? Since you have inquired, I will carefully explain the organization of Huizhong Fish Company and its recent business situation for your inspection. The matter stems from the fact that the 51 pure Chinese fish firms in this port, in view of the past years of mutual infighting among their peers, created an opportunity for foreigners to monopolize the fishing industry. In order to concentrate capital and resist and plug the loopholes, they initiated the organization of Huizhong Fish Company to sell domestic and foreign seafood, not exclusively Japanese fish. Kui Yanfang, entrusted with the heavy responsibility by all the fish industry colleagues who did not abandon him, urged the matter many times, and it was difficult to refuse out of friendship. However, my intention is to plug the loopholes, and the only way to do this is to develop our country's fishing industry. Therefore, before I took office, I submitted this idea to my colleagues for discussion, and they unanimously agreed. Therefore, I resolutely sacrificed everything and reluctantly accepted this responsibility, and declared that the management was a voluntary position, without salary or travel expenses. All the profits of the company would be distributed to the colleagues to show impartiality. The business policy of Huizhong Company is recorded in the declaration of the founding of the company, which is attached for your review. According to Huizhong Company, it was established on June 12 at the Yuye Dunhe Public Office and opened on July 3. What your letter says, according to reports, the fish company was organized at the time of the Wan case to exclusively sell Japanese fish, which is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Huizhong was established before the Wan case, and the goods sold were by no means entirely Japanese goods. When the Wan case occurred, the whole country was indignant. I proposed a proposal not to import Japanese goods, which was unanimously approved by all fish industry colleagues. Therefore, Huizhong has persisted for several months and has never imported Japanese goods. If you don't believe me, there is evidence to prove it. The foreign fish imported into our country is mainly salmon, and salmon used to be all over the market at this time of year, but this year it has disappeared from the market. This is really the result of the fish industry's efforts to boycott. I have persuaded and admonished, and my tongue is worn out, and I am slightly relieved to have achieved this effect. All of the above is the truth, and the nature of the company and my intentions can also be proved by this. Recently, a large number of salmon have arrived in various foreign firms, and people have repeatedly come to negotiate, but I have strictly refused them. It is probably because of this that I have offended people, causing them to spread rumors to confuse your association and vent their personal anger. I am completely voluntary for Huizhong, and what I hope is to guide my fish industry colleagues to develop our own country's fish industry. The management is a voluntary position, and all the company's profits are distributed to the colleagues. Even if I am foolish, how can I dare to risk great disapproval and secretly import enemy goods, benefiting others and harming myself? I am honored to be asked, and I respectfully report to you. I hope that you will disclose the original letter in the newspaper to show the world and clarify the matter. In short, as long as I am alive, I will never act as an accomplice to the enemy and mislead the country. I hope you will understand. Respectfully addressed to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Attached is a copy of the Huizhong Fish Company's declaration of founding.</p>
<p>In recent years, the amount of foreign fish imported has been huge. Taking Shanghai as an example, it reaches several million yuan per year, and the right to sell is controlled by foreign merchants, who take advantage of the weakness of competition among our country's fish merchants, manipulate the market, raise prices, and enjoy huge profits. This causes vendors to bear high costs due to mutual competition, and consumers to pay high prices due to foreign merchant manipulation. At a time when our country's fishing industry is not yet developed and people's livelihoods are deteriorating, we in the industry cannot but兼营foreign fish to plug this huge loophole, and how can we bear to let others control us and increase the burden on our people? Realizing that past competition was not a good plan, we are planning for future unity. At the beginning of this year, we once planned, but unfortunately, some were hesitant, so it was not realized. In the early summer, we discussed it with Kui Yanfang, who said with emotion, "The Shanghai fish industry has been disorganized for a long time. If we don't unite, how can we survive? It is not too late to plan now. Although concentrating our strength for direct purchase can prevent foreign merchants from monopolizing and lower prices, the import of foreign goods and the outflow of money are still not fundamental solutions. In the future, we must expand our collective strength to help develop our country's fishing industry and recover great profits. This is the true mission of the fish industry colleagues." Now that the fish industry has this awareness, it is probably the beginning of fulfilling its true mission. If there is anything needed, I dare not spare my efforts to help them succeed. We in the industry are deeply grateful for Kui's words, so we gathered to discuss the organization of Huizhong Fish Company, drafted regulations, and elected Kui as manager. I hope that all of us in the Shanghai fish industry will remain consistent, abandon our individual opinions, eliminate the bad habit of infighting, and unite our hearts and minds to safeguard our industry's rights and seek convenience for the people's food. Our industry's future will hopefully be bright.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Public Notice by Party and Government on the People's Anti-Japanese Movement <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government jointly issued a public notice yesterday, stating: "Regarding the joint public notice, since Japan's forceful occupation of Liaoning and Jilin, the people of the entire nation have been deeply indignant and have risen up in the anti-Japanese movement. Their patriotic fervor is certainly commendable. However, their actions should follow the correct path to avoid accidental disputes that could be exploited by reactionary elements. Recently, some citizens in our city have engaged in excessive behavior, which is highly inappropriate. Therefore, this special joint public notice is issued, urging all citizens to ensure that future anti-Japanese movements follow the correct path. If any lawless individuals take the opportunity to cause disturbances, disrupt local security, or hinder the performance of duties by conference affairs personnel, this Party and Government will certainly strictly enforce the law and will not tolerate such actions. Let all be mindful and strictly abide by this notice."</p>
<h3 id="e97">Open Letter from the Sixth District Party Headquarters to the People of Zhabei <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Do Not Antagonize Public Security</p>
<p>Do Not Be Exploited by Reactionaries</p>
<p>The Sixth District Party Headquarters issued an open letter to the people, stating: "To the esteemed compatriots of Zhabei, In recent days, a series of unfortunate incidents have occurred in the Baoshan Road area, which is a great regret during this tense period of anti-Japanese sentiment. After careful consideration, the tragic incident of October 1st was entirely caused by the reckless actions of You Bolu. Therefore, standing on a just position, we have already forwarded the matter to higher authorities, demanding that You Bolu be severely punished, his assets confiscated, and compensation be provided to the injured and deceased. No matter what, we are determined not to resist and will fight to the death against the traitors who shot innocent people. This is the resolution of the Party Headquarters of this district regarding the You case, and we believe that our mutually supportive people will fully understand. However, we must solemnly declare that You Bolu's barbaric actions should be his sole responsibility and should not involve the existence of public security agencies. Therefore, the future peace of the people should continue to rely on responsible public security personnel to maintain it. The security of the entire city can only be guaranteed by the public security authorities taking further measures. This is not to protect any individual's actions, but to recognize that the tragic incident of October 1st can only be resolved by demanding that You Bolu be executed to appease public anger, not by antagonizing public security, so that our enthusiastic patriotic actions do not fall into the trap of being reactionary. Unfortunately, one wave subsides and another rises. On the night of October 3rd, a riot occurred at the Fifth District Police Station. Based on reports from all sides, it is clear that reactionary elements are exploiting the period of public anger and are engaging in excessive actions. It can be seen that our revolutionary people, under the banner of bravely saving the country and eradicating traitors, are instead creating the best opportunity for troublemakers to instigate riots. This is something that our patriotic people did not expect. Therefore, at this critical moment, we must earnestly inform you in order to gain the understanding of our enthusiastic people. First, the Party Headquarters of this district will resolutely proceed with the legal and strict handling of the You case, representing the will of the people, and will not harbor any selfish intentions of compromise or evasion. Second, since reactionary elements have already taken the opportunity to implement large-scale sabotage plans, during this turbulent period, our people who care about national affairs should assist the public security authorities in eliminating these crises. If not, they should also carefully guard their homes, prevent riots, and not harbor the mentality of watching the excitement, which leads to unconscious gatherings. Especially in times of urgent situations, they should leave dangerous areas and deprive reactionary elements of the opportunity to coerce the public. Therefore, we hope that the people will understand the seriousness of the national crisis and show their dedication to maintaining order. At the same time, they should go further and stand on the same front as our Party comrades to complete the glorious task of resisting Japan and saving the country. It must be understood that in our current difficult environment, there is absolutely no room for free disruption. Third, the activities of reactionary elements not only disrupt public security and plunge our people into misery, but also create opportunities for arson and cause major disputes over national defense. Therefore, we absolutely do not allow the existence of reactionary forces. Even our sensible people should not allow the hidden growth of reactionary forces. However, due to the impulse of the You case, there may be unexpected misunderstandings. We dare to clearly inform you to be careful and not to blindly gather, and not to be incited by reactionaries. This is also the understanding that our citizens should have. If the speaker is earnest but the listener is indifferent, then the public security authorities, due to the needs of performing their duties, may take emergency measures, and the innocent people who are affected will be responsible for their own actions. We may want to save you but have no way to do so. The Executive Committee of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Kuomintang of China, October 4th."</p>
<h3 id="e98">New Naval Aircraft, Jianghe, Manufactured Domestically <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Test flight yesterday at Longhua Airfield</p>
<p>Piloted personally by Mr. Shen Dexie</p>
<p>Excellent results after fifteen minutes of flight</p>
<p>The two aircraft manufactured by the Aircraft Manufacturing Department of the Ministry of the Navy, one of which was completed at the end of last month and named Jianghe, underwent a test flight at the Longhua China Aviation Corporation airfield at approximately 8:00 AM yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Manufacturing Process: The Aircraft Manufacturing Department of the Navy was originally located in Mawei. In February of this year, it was ordered to move to Shanghai and repaired the old buildings of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy at Gaochangmiao West Fort. Construction began in April. All the workers were brought from Mawei, about a hundred people. The director is Mr. Zeng Yijing, who studied in the United Kingdom and has extensive research in aircraft manufacturing.</p>
<p>One Aircraft Completed: The aircraft previously manufactured by the department in Mawei included numbers from Jia to Ji. The one currently being manufactured is Geng. After six months, one aircraft has been completed. Initially, Director Zeng named it Jianggeng, but the Ministry of the Navy ordered it to be changed to Jianghe. All materials, except for the engine, which is an American product, such as wood, paint, and other materials, are all produced in our country. The total price is about 30,000 yuan in Chinese currency. However, its performance is not inferior to imported products.</p>
<p>Test Flight Yesterday Morning: The aircraft underwent its first test flight at the Longhua seaplane field yesterday morning. In addition to Director Zeng Yijing of the department and other important officials of the department, those present included Mr. Shen Xie, Director of the Aviation Department of the Ministry of the Navy, Wang Zhu of China Aviation Corporation, and Mr. Perrin, a Western director of China Aviation Corporation, and over ten others. The workers of the department first transported the aircraft from the manufacturing department to the Longhua China Aviation Corporation for a test flight on the front river. Director Shen piloted it himself. It took off at 9:20 AM, circled the river once, and then left the water surface, soaring in the air for about fifteen minutes before safely landing on the water surface. The results were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Aircraft: The aircraft is very sturdy. The movement of each part, in the air and on the water surface, is very agile. It is an amphibious biplane that can be folded. It can accommodate two people, front and back. It has 165 horsepower and can fly 90 miles per hour. The altitude is over 2,000 feet. The fully loaded weight of the seaplane is 2,460 pounds, and the fully loaded weight of the land plane is 2,250 pounds. The exterior is painted white, and the tail is painted with the national emblem of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth. The color scheme is very beautiful.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's Remarks: According to Director Shen Dexie's statement to the Huadong News Agency reporter, the military and political departments and the navy are now vigorously expanding aviation. However, due to limited funding, rapid development has not been possible. However, expanding the air force is easier than the navy. The Navy of our country currently has about dozens of aircraft. Except for a few imported products, the rest are all manufactured by the Aircraft Manufacturing Department of the Navy in Mawei. They can be used for both military and commercial purposes, and the results are not inferior to imported products.</p>

<p>When Tanaka Giichi was in power in Japan, his so-called "Positive Policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia" was actually a concrete manifestation of imperialist conspiracies. His ideas on aggressive steps were terrible. Reading it causes one to break out in a cold sweat. After the full text of the memorial, translated from the original, was printed and distributed by the publishing department of the Xinsheng Communication Agency, located at the eastern end of the Shilu Road, Hankou Road, in the Daxinfang area of this city, it attracted considerable attention from the Chinese people. Hundreds of thousands of copies were printed. A few days ago, due to a shortage of paper, printing was temporarily suspended. It is now reported that the agency has made every effort to collect a large quantity of Tianzhang Paper Factory goods and Swedish newspapers. Except for those who specified the use of Daolin paper, which will have a slightly increased printing cost, the price will remain at four yuan per hundred copies, plus one yuan for postage. Commissions for printing are constantly being entrusted from both domestic and foreign locations, which is enough to show that the hearts of the people are not dead.</p>

<p>University Students Pay Attention to Researching Domestic Raw Materials</p>
<p>The Science Society students of Shanghai's Hujiang and John's Universities, in order to promote the adoption of domestic raw materials by the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, have specifically launched the organization of a Raw Material Research Association. If various sectors are accustomed to using Japanese raw materials, but have difficulty in replacing them with domestic goods, they can notify the association of the name, value, sample, and advantages of the Japanese goods. The researchers of the association will carefully study them in the spirit of science and report the results to various sectors, so that the future of boycotting Japanese goods can break through another bottleneck. The intention is very good. It is reported that the association is already in the process of being organized, and that prominent businessmen, such as Yu Qiaqing, are willing to provide assistance.</p>

<p>You and the Five Police Officers Involved in the Incident Will Be Sent to the Court</p>
<p>The Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, in light of the fact that You Bolu, the chief of the Fifth District, ordered the shooting and killing of many enthusiastic anti-Japanese and national salvation masses, has paid great attention to the matter regarding official discipline. After sending personnel to investigate in detail and confirming the facts, the Committee specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Executive Committee, which was then forwarded to the Municipal Government, advocating strict punishment to appease public anger. The original letter is recorded below: "Regarding the incident in which police officers of the Fifth District Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau shot and killed the public on the first of this month, resulting in a tragic incident, the matter is extremely serious. The Committee sent personnel to investigate the matter in detail and received a reply stating, 'Your office was ordered to investigate the Baoshan Road tragedy and conducted separate inquiries at the scene and other related parties yesterday. At about 6:00 PM on the first of this month, soldiers Hou Zhanyuan, Chuan Jisan, and Zhou Xiaoying of the Fifth Artillery Team of the Ministry of Railways were ordered to go out to conduct anti-Japanese propaganda and post slogans. The soldiers saw the police亭 at Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road, which was clearly visible to the public, and immediately posted slogans. They were stopped by the patrol officer Guo Wenhan. The soldiers told him about their hatred for the destruction of the country and argued. Passersby watched and felt indignant about the matter, and some scolded the police officer as a slave who lost his country. At that time, the police officer struck the soldier's wrist with a baton and told them to leave quickly. The soldiers refused to comply and stuck the slogans on his body. They were then taken to the Fifth District Police Station. The masses were very dissatisfied and followed behind, gathering at the entrance of the Fifth District and refusing to disperse, requesting the bureau to punish the officer. The police also posted anti-Japanese slogans at the entrance of the Fifth District. Later, after being questioned by the district official, the soldiers were released. They stood on top of the car at the entrance of the Fifth District and reported that Guo, the district official, planned to dismiss the police officer tomorrow, and persuaded the masses to disperse. At that time, Comrade Yang Youren of the Sixth District also persuaded the masses to disperse, and the masses were satisfied. A portion of the people went north and south and dispersed on their own. A portion followed to the Sixth District Party Headquarters to quietly listen to the results of the negotiations. A portion remained and refused to disperse. They said that at about 2:00 PM that afternoon, three Japanese people went to the Fifth District Bureau and stayed inside for an hour, talking about something, and requested the district chief to report the details. Baoshan Road is an important thoroughfare for pedestrians. When people gather, those who pass by will inevitably stop and watch. As a result, the number of people gathered increased to about a thousand. At this time, Comrades Yang Youren and Feng Xiancheng of the Sixth District came again, inquired about the reason, and Feng Xiancheng introduced You Bolu to report the details to the public. Then, Comrades Feng Xiancheng and Yang Youren gave speeches to persuade the public to disperse. The public called You a traitor. At this time, a public bus from the North Station to Jiangwan also stopped to listen. Shi Tifen, an inspector of the bus company, urgently ordered the bus to leave, but the engine had stopped and could not start. The driver tried to find a way to start the car, but the public said that since the car had stopped, it should not be started again in the crowd. The driver was beaten by the public and rescued by Shi Tifen to the Fifth District. At this time, Comrades Yang Youren and Feng Xiancheng had already entered the crowd and persuaded everyone to disperse. The public was already showing signs of dispersing. At this moment, You Bolu, the chief of the district, ordered to open fire. The first order was issued, but the police officers did not fire. The district chief jumped up and shouted to open fire, and said that if they did not fire, their own lives would be in danger. So, live ammunition was fired, with more than twenty shots. Cai Yongfang and Shen Wanlin were killed. Cai was from Yuyao, Zhejiang, 22 years old. The bullet entered from the left back of his cheek and exited from his right temple, and he fell face down towards the north opposite the Fifth District. His family members were all farmers in his hometown, and he was a single man working as a bookbinder at Shiyongji Binding Workshop in Xingye Lane, Baotong Road, Shanghai. At 8:00 PM that afternoon, he finished bathing at the bathhouse at the southern end of Qiujiang Road, and encountered the Fifth District on the way. At this time, District Chief You ordered the police to open fire and unfortunately died. This person was usually honest and kind, and got along well with his friends. He had worked at Shiyongji for many years. Shen was from Zhenjiang, 18 years old. The bullet entered from his back and exited from his chest, and he fell face down towards the north in front of Yongtai Shop, 42 steps in a straight line from the Fifth District Bureau. He was an apprentice at Dali Military Uniform Shop on Baoshan Road. Five people were injured. Wang Xiangshou was shot in the back shoulder and out the front chest. Luo Fusheng was shot in the lower left back and out the front. Zhang Baolin was shot through the back and waist. Shen Xuekun was shot in the arm. Wang Hexing was shot in the left calf and the bullet did not exit. In addition, there are minor injuries who have not been admitted to the hospital, which are still being investigated. When asked, Dr. Sun Xiaoshan, the medical director of Jisheng Hospital, said that the bullets of those who were injured and sought treatment here all entered from behind, which proves that the public had already fled. As for Cai Yongfang, who died, the Fifth District Bureau reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday that 'a pistol and three bullets were found on the deceased.' According to someone from a shop opposite the Fifth District Bureau (who asked to remain confidential), 'We did not sleep all night and watched the police officers pick up bullets and sweep up blood. At about 4:00 AM, they put a pistol inside the clothes of a deceased person in front of the shop.' According to Dong Guokai, the leader of the artillery team, 'After the tragedy occurred, I went to the scene and saw that the deceased appeared to be a worker in the store, lying face down with his hands and feet open. There were no guns or bullets, which can serve as proof.' Five police officers Lin Qingxiang, Qiao Xuechang, Liu Weicheng, Wu Maolin, and Lin Zhanyou said that they were forced to open fire by the district chief's second order. This is the situation of the tragedy. We should report the investigated situation truthfully. We respectfully ask you to examine it. According to this, when the whole country is resisting Japan and saving the country, and public sentiment is激昂, posting slogans is a very minor matter. The police officer failed to properly persuade them and detained people in the bureau, which aroused the righteous indignation of the viewers and gathered at the entrance of the Public Security Bureau, resulting in a serious situation. Although people were released and police were dismissed, it was inappropriate that a decision was not made beforehand. The public saw that the Japanese had stayed in the district bureau for an hour. What was the purpose? It aroused suspicion. They requested the district chief to answer. After explaining the details and being persuaded by Yang and Feng from the Sixth District, the public was about to disperse. There was no need to open fire to demonstrate. Even if there was a need to demonstrate, the first thing to do would be to fire a blank shot to warn. However, District Chief You Bolu issued an order when the public was about to disperse (as evidenced by the bullets all entering from behind), killing many people, disregarding human life, and perverting the law for profit. This is a heinous crime. Moreover, it was found that the district chief was dismissed due to a case when he was the previous branch director. According to the law, he should not be re-employed as a police officer in this city. Why was he still employed and promoted to district chief? This is difficult to understand. Correspondingly, we request your council to immediately forward this to the Municipal Government, to severely punish the district chief, in order to rectify officialdom and appease the public anger. We are extremely eager."</p>
<p>Another report states that at 8:00 PM on the first of this month, a conflict occurred between the public and the police on Baoshan Road, under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District, resulting in a tragic incident of gunshot wounds and deaths. After Mayor Zhang was notified, he immediately ordered the district chief You Bolu to be suspended from his duties and investigated. At the same time, he ordered Secretary-General Yu Hongjun to work with Municipal Party Committee member Wu Kaixian and Deputy Adjutant Jiang Yi of the Garrison Headquarters to thoroughly investigate the truth. The details were recorded in the previous newspaper. Now we know that Yu, Wu, and Jiang have completed their investigation of the incident and reported it to the Municipal Government, requesting that it be handled according to law. Mayor Zhang ordered that the district chief and the police officers involved in the incident be sent to the court for strict punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e102">All Circles Mourned Jiang Weishui Yesterday <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Painful History of Taiwan's Loss and Mr. Jiang's Struggle</p>
<p>Heartfelt Speeches by Representatives from Korea and India</p>
<p>Important Resolutions Passed by the Assembly</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 4th) morning at 9:00 AM, all circles in Shanghai held a memorial meeting for Mr. Jiang Weishui, the revolutionary leader of Taiwan, at the Penglai Grand Theater, Xiaoximen. It is estimated that over 600 representatives from more than 70 groups, including the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, the General Chamber of Commerce, the Postal Workers' Union, the United Federation of Korean Groups in Shanghai, the Indian National League in Shanghai, the Taiwan Compatriot Association in Shanghai, the Asian Cultural Association, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Chizhi College, the Quanzhang Middle School, and the Gongshi Middle School, participated in the memorial. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely solemn. The presidium of the assembly included Huang Yanpei, Wu Mai, Huang Jiang Weishui's posthumous portrait</p>
<p>Jing Wan, Liu Shimu, Zhuang Xiquan, Shen Zhuowu, and Xu Jigong. After the music was played to start the meeting, the entire assembly stood at attention and bowed three times to the Party and national flag and the portrait of the Premier. Then, they bowed once to Mr. Jiang Weishui. After the presidium's Shen Zhuowu respectfully read the Premier's will, they were silent for three minutes to commemorate the Premier and to mourn Mr. Jiang Weishui, presenting wreaths. The chairman announced the purpose of the meeting, and Xu Jigong reported on the painful history of Taiwan's occupation by Japan. His words were extremely painful, stating roughly: "During the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, our country failed, and the Qing court sent Li Hongzhang to sign a peace treaty with Japan, including (1) the cession of Taiwan to Japan and (2) compensation of 30 million taels of silver. When the people of Taiwan heard this news, their hearts were filled with indignation, and they rose up in resistance. They organized an anti-Japanese group, and the people of the entire island armed themselves for self-defense. Although Japan had more than 30 warships, they could not land. After a standoff of Photograph of the memorial service for Mr. Jiang Weishui (taken by Penglai Photo Studio)</p>
<p>for two months, Japan had no choice but to protest to the Qing court again. Unexpectedly, the Qing government was weak and incompetent, and mentally deranged, and secretly presented a map of Taiwan to Japan. Japan was then able to occupy Taiwan. The compatriots of Taiwan have since become slaves of a conquered nation. After occupying Taiwan, Japan carried out massacres. The cruel methods of killing were such that engineers were first sent to survey the areas where Taiwanese people lived, then dug underground holes, and sent troops to drive the Taiwanese people into the holes to be buried alive. How could such cruelty be tolerated? For 37 years, the people of Taiwan have been under the iron heel of Japan. Mr. Jiang Weishui, the liberator of the people of Taiwan, died this year at the age of only 42. It is truly heartbreaking to speak of. Who will the future liberation of our Taiwanese people rely on? Relying on heaven, relying on earth, is useless. We must rely on our four million Taiwanese compatriots and the four hundred million compatriots of our motherland, 'working hard together to fight!'" Next, Zhuang Xiquan reported on the historical outline of Mr. Jiang Weishui. Mr. Jiang died at the age of 42, having been engaged in revolution for 20 years. He came from a medical school and studied Chinese politics with his classmates while at school. The Japanese principal often tried to stop him. Mr. Jiang argued with him, and the Japanese was moved to tears. After graduation, he was imprisoned for resisting Japanese political oppression. Whether it was the trial or the prison officials, they not only did not dare to show the slightest disrespect, but also expressed regret and admiration. Mr. Jiang's life's work included founding the Taiwan Minbao newspaper, organizing the Taiwan Cultural Association, establishing the Taiwan People's Party, the Taiwan General Labor Union, and the Taiwan Farmers' Association. His achievements were remarkable. However, in recent years, due to his opposition to Japan's use of poison to kill the indigenous people of Taiwan and Taiwan's opium policy, he offended the Governor-General of Taiwan, who disbanded the People's Party. After the dissolution, Mr. Jiang was exhausted, but continued to work hard. With the income from his medical practice, in addition to maintaining his personal life, he helped poor revolutionary comrades. People at the time compared his hard work to that of Gandhi. Mr. Jiang became ill and died as a result. Mr. Jiang's death was not from illness, but from the hands of Japanese imperialism." After the report, Wu Mai, the executive committee member and propaganda director of the National Lawyers Association and the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, read the memorial text, which stated roughly, "Alas, the ancestral land is not well made, entrusting the sea frontier to the island barbarians. It has been thirty-seven years since then, and the time is getting more and more dangerous. Looking at the slaughter of the captives, my heart aches and my liver is torn apart. If we do not speed up the rescue, we will be trapped in this predicament for a long time. ... I, the young man Mai, do not measure myself, but plan to wash away the national shame. I am determined to annihilate the Japanese pirates on the coast in the near future." Next, Huang Shaomei and Peng Ziming, representatives of the Asian Cultural Association, delivered memorial texts, which stated roughly, "Alas, the situation in Taiwan is bleak and dark. When the bad news came, my colleagues shed tears. The great enemy has not been destroyed, and the revolution has not been completed. The people are suffering, in a sea of fire. Return our rivers and mountains and restore their freedom. You, sir, took the lead, leading the entire Taiwan, actively opposing Japan, with sincerity and without separation. You never gave up, tasting gall. For twenty years, you also sponsored the organization of the New International, uniting small and weak nations and expanding anti-imperialism. You often said that our responsibilities are heavy, and that we must liberate the nation and achieve world harmony, so that we will not have lived in vain. Your words are still in our ears, but the sage has passed away. All who have blood and energy are saddened. The dead are gone, but their spirit lives on forever. Determining their legacy is up to future generations. Strive on, comrades, and make meritorious contributions, Taiwanese people. Continue to fight, continue to sacrifice, vow to destroy the great enemy, and complete the revolution. Today, we offer sacrifices to express our sincere heart. If you are conscious in the afterlife, come and enjoy it. Enjoy!" After the sacrifices, Mr. Huang Yanpei gave a speech, saying that Mr. Jiang Weishui was an unnamed Gandhi, a Gandhi who did not succeed. A truly famous Gandhi must have many unnamed Gandhis, and then Gandhi will succeed. What China needs at this moment is tens of millions of unnamed Gandhis, tens of millions of Mr. Jiangs, so that Mr. Jiang will not die and China will not perish. Then, Shen Zhuowu gave a speech, saying that we in China now need to resist. Whether male or female, we must resist, and we must resist our enemy, Japan. Next, representatives from the United Federation of Korean Groups, Park Chang-se and Kim Hong-seo, the president of the Indian League, Taylor St., and Wu Mai and Peng Ziming, all gave extremely heartfelt speeches. The two Koreans expressed deep indignation and pain at the Japanese occupation of the Eastern Province, stating roughly that the people of the province had been reduced to slaves of a conquered nation. If China does not rise up and fight to the death with Japan, it will soon perish as well. We, the oppressed peoples, must unite and overthrow Japanese imperialism. Finally, the assembly passed important resolutions: (1) Request the government to clearly order military and police agencies not to arrest Taiwanese, Koreans, and other small and weak nations and send them to Japan and other authorities; (2) According to the Premier's instructions to assist small and weak nations, request the government and compatriots from all walks of life to sponsor Taiwanese comrades in Shanghai in establishing Weishui School as a revolutionary memorial. After the resolutions were passed, they shouted slogans, played mournful music, and when the meeting ended, it was already 1:30 PM.</p>

<p>Equipped with a Lifting Ladder on the Car</p>
<p>Stealing Cloth Banners from Various Roads</p>
<p>Around 1 a.m. yesterday morning, two Japanese men, driving a privately owned grayish-yellow car equipped with a ladder-like structure, stole and tore down white cloths and various anti-Japanese slogans posted at key road intersections along Jing'an Temple Road and Route Say Zoong, as well as those pasted on the walls of thoroughfares. Subsequently, the two Japanese men drove the car to Kangjia Bridge Alley, where they spotted a white bamboo cloth banner hanging diagonally near the corner of Longquan Garden. The Japanese men attempted to tear it down again, but a crowd of passersby grew larger and larger. Witnessing this barbaric behavior, they were all filled with indignation and were about to step forward to reason with them. Fortunately, nearby patrol officers heard the commotion and arrived in time to stop the two Japanese men. Realizing their plan had failed, the Japanese men jumped into the car, accelerated to full speed, and sped off westward.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Robbery in Broad Daylight on Tongfu Road <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Two Handguns Stolen</p>
<p>Victims All Tied Up</p>
<p>Yu Wenjun, residing at No. 9, Lane 4, Huacheng Li, Tongfu Road, works at Dafeng Real Estate Company, No. 21 Yuanmingyuan Road. Around 10 a.m. yesterday morning, five robbers suddenly arrived, four of whom were armed with handguns. They broke in through the back door and tied up all thirteen men and women, including the tenant Chen Guirong, who lived in the same house, using torn bedsheets as ropes. They were all imprisoned in the rear room on the lower floor. Then, the robbers went upstairs, entered the rooms, rummaged through chests and cabinets, and robbed for about forty-five minutes. They stole jewelry, including jadeite and diamond ornaments, worth over four thousand yuan, along with over one hundred yuan in cash, and fled without a trace. Chen Guirong, who lived upstairs, was a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. One of his handguns was also taken away by the thugs. Also, when the robbers were committing the robbery, Chen's friend, Special Constable Cai Tonggui, came to visit Chen. As soon as he entered the main gate, he was held by two robbers acting as lookouts. They disarmed him of his handgun and then drove him into the inner room, where he was imprisoned together with the others. Therefore, in addition to the silver and jewelry, the robbers obtained two handguns. It is said that the robbers were all young in appearance, with one wearing a Western suit as the leader. The others wore long gowns and short jackets of various styles. When they entered the door, they shouted that they were looking for Yu, and then they entered the hall, tore up the bedsheets on the bed, turned them into strips of cloth, and tied up the hands and feet of all the men and women in the house, so the victims had no way to ask for help. It is reported that the stolen items were mostly jewelry, including three pairs of gold-inlaid jade auspicious ornaments and a jadeite-inlaid diamond ornament, of considerable value. Upon hearing the news, the Xinzha Police Department immediately dispatched detectives to the scene to investigate and apprehend the suspects.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Disaster Relief News from Various Provinces <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Flood Relief Association News</p>
<p>Survey of Shaobo Town and Various Villages: The association recently received a telegram from Yuan Jimei, acting on behalf of the Yangzhou office, providing a detailed report on the disaster situation in various villages of Shaobo. The original telegram is recorded below. On September 30th, Jimei, accompanied by relief workers Zhou Junliangji and Zhao Yisun, among others, carrying twelve bundles of relief clothing donated by all sectors of Suzhou, totaling over two thousand pieces, and three hundred pieces of various medicines, personally went to various villages in Shaobo to investigate. They arrived in the town at 11:00 a.m., led by Zhou Maosen and Geng Yuting of the World Red Swastika Society, and Sun Jiuru of the Chamber of Commerce, among others. They rested at the Zhongnan Hotel for a short time and then went to inspect the disaster situation in the South Street of the town. From South Pond Small Street and the left and right firewood dams to Bao Gong Temple, everything was washed away by the water, a vast expanse of water. They then took a charity ferry to Bao Gong Temple to inspect. They saw that there were still over thirty families in the temple, about one hundred disaster victims taking refuge inside. Another thirty or so families were taking refuge below Bao Gong Temple. All the houses were completely washed away by the water, and they had nowhere to go. They ate two meals a day, relying entirely on the town's porridge kitchen to survive. They also inspected North Street, and the situation was even worse than South Street. Countless houses were washed away by the water along the way. All the streets had become a pile of rubble. Along the street, only reed mat sheds were seen, all temporary shelters for disaster victims. There were eight breaches in the dike in front of the South Street Guan Yi Post Station, resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries. There were seven breaches in the dike in North Street, resulting in over three hundred deaths and injuries. Currently, there are about 1,300 disaster victims in the town and nearby areas. The Shaobo Flood Relief Association has established three porridge kitchens to help the disaster victims survive. One is located in the Town God Temple in the town, serving porridge to about 700 disaster victims every day. The second is located in the Zhongdao Wenchang Palace, serving about 400 people every day. The third is located in the Nandutian Temple, serving about 300 people every day. It is estimated that the three kitchens need about six shi of rice per day, with each person receiving about five he of rice per day. Currently, local impartial gentry have hired two charity ferries at the washed-away area of South Pond to facilitate the passage of disaster victims. There is a large bridge from Bao Gong Temple to South Street, which was broken by the water. It is planned to repair it and restore it to its original state so that the disaster victims on the opposite bank can travel back and forth. They discussed with Zhou Maosen, Geng Yuting, and Zhao Yisun to establish porridge kitchens in Qishu, Yong'an, Xiaqiao, Zhenwu Temple, and along the He Village, so that the disaster victims in each village can obtain food nearby, which would be most convenient. Moreover, Sun Jun Jiuru and Zhou Jun Maosen of the Chamber of Commerce consider it especially important to distribute reed mats for the disaster victims to build reed sheds for shelter. From south to north in Shaobo Town, there are dozens of breaches in the dikes, with the most severe disaster areas being from Zhuxiangkou Yang Mujian Wharf in the south to Guan Yi Post Station in the north, which is extremely tragic. The town is exceptionally filthy, with flies and insects filling the entire town, probably exceeding the number of China's 400 million compatriots. This matter is extremely noteworthy. If measures are not taken quickly to clean it, it will be extremely harmful to the hygiene of the people in the town. In the afternoon, accompanied by Zhang Bin, the village head of Qishu Town, and others, they took a boat from Ai Ling Lake all the way to the villages of Xiaqiao 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to survey. The fields on the left and right were indistinguishable from the lake, forming a vast expanse of water. When the boat arrived at Xiaqiao Village, over twenty small boats carrying disaster victims, old and young, came forward, surrounding and begging for relief. They comforted them with kind words and then proceeded forward, finally reaching Qishu Village. They saw that the embankments on both sides had completely collapsed. The breach in the left-hand side dike directly rushed towards the eastern end of Guangfeng Dike on the opposite bank. The water washed into the Xiahe area of Xinghua, where about 100 families lived in Guangfeng Dike. The houses were washed away by the water. Later, the disaster victims built reed sheds on both banks to shelter themselves. At a little after 5:00 p.m., they arrived at Qishu Town and saw about 1,000 disaster victims on both banks, with about 300 families. Nine-tenths of the houses were washed away, and the remaining houses were still in the water. In the middle of the river, there was a large bridge, which was also washed down, preventing passage to the opposite bank. When the boat arrived in the town, the disaster victims on both banks cried out for help, and the tragic situation was witnessed. All colleagues were heartbroken and shed tears. After the inspection, they immediately returned to Shaobo Town, which was already past 8:00 p.m. (omitted below)</p>
<p>Situation of Reception Centers and Porridge Kitchens in Jiangdu: The association's Yangzhou office reports that the reception centers have now been handed over to the Jiangdu Investigation and Release Bureau of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee Disaster Area Work Group. It has recently been actively preparing to establish porridge kitchens and has received the support of local gentry Zhao Yisun, Geng Yuting, and Zhou Maosen. The original telegram is as follows: From September 1st to September 20th, our office established seven reception centers, accommodating over 10,000 people. All expenses for rice, dry food, firewood, reed mats, and other miscellaneous items needed in the centers were allocated by our office. From September 21st, they have been handed over to the Jiangdu County Investigation and Release Bureau of the National Government Flood Relief Committee Disaster Area Work Group. Because the disaster situation in the Eighth District of Jiangdu County, Shaobo, such as Qishu, Yong'an Xiaqiao, Zhenwu Temple, and He Village, is extremely severe, it is proposed to establish porridge kitchens in each village on the spot, which is simpler and more convenient than setting up reception centers in the city, and disaster victims can definitely obtain real benefits (omitted below).</p>
<p>Disaster Situation in the Eastern and Western Villages of Baoying: The association recently received a telegram from Chen Huichen, acting on behalf of the Baoying office, stating that he had conducted a detailed survey of the eastern and western villages yesterday. In the eastern villages, such as Wangzhigang, Sheyang, Xian 、Juexi, etc., villages and settlements are sparsely populated, with nine out of ten houses destroyed, with people either taking refuge on high ground or going to other places. In the western villages, such as Jiaji, etc., the water in the fields is seven chi deep, with scattered farmhouses, completely dilapidated. The accumulated water has not receded, forming a vast expanse of water. The disaster area is expanding, the number of disaster-stricken households is increasing daily, and the scene is desolate, with intermittent cooking smoke. If the destroyed embankments of various companies are not urgently restored, not only will counties such as Xingdong suffer the same fate of being submerged, but the eastern and western villages of Baoying will also have no hope of planting wheat. The great disaster that is coming in the future, how can it be imagined? The rescue operations have just concluded, focusing solely on reception, and those transported to Jiangnan are even more continuously flowing. Urgent relief will be carried out in the coming days. The water route is vast, scattered and sporadic, making it difficult to investigate households and impossible to do so quickly. Relief funds are urgently needed in large amounts to provide thorough relief. The disaster situation in the county is evident.</p>
<p>Hunan Province Asks the Clothing Relief Association for Clothing</p>
<p>The Clothing and Bedding Disaster Relief Association at No. 207, West Mendelland Road, Racecourse, received yesterday a special envoy from the Hunan Provincial Government, Guo Xiaoxiao, who brought a certificate to the association, saying that the floods in the province this year are severe, and the people are displaced. With the autumn chill, everyone feels the lack of clothing. I recently heard that your association is enthusiastic about charity and has collected a lot of clothing. Mr. Huang Shouzhou promised to distribute it appropriately. It is reported that more than 3,000 pieces of clothing were sent from the South City office yesterday, and more than 900 pieces were donated to the association by various sectors.</p>
<p>Jisheng Association Jiangbei Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The summary of the Jiangbei disaster relief handled by the Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Association in Gaoyou, Yangzhou, Shaobo, Huaiyin, Huai'an, Siyang, and other counties has been published in this newspaper three times before. In addition to transporting 20,200 bags of relief flour to Gaoyou, Shaobo, and other places and 5,000 bags of relief flour to Qingjiang, Huai'an, and other places, the association loaded 5,000 bags of relief flour onto the Daqing Wheel on October 2nd and transported them to Sanjiangying, where they were handed over to Ma Shu'ang, a relief worker of the association, with 1,500 bags transported to Yizheng and 3,500 bags used to supplement relief in the second district of Yangzhou. In addition, 1,000 shi of wheat seeds were transported from Wuxi to Huai'an and other counties for distribution. 7,000 sets of new and old cotton clothes were transported to the disaster area for assistance. As the weather is getting colder, in addition to distributing silver dollars and medicines for emergency relief, plans for food and clothing for the people are being made to ensure that they are fed and warm. It is hoped that the remaining lives can be preserved. It is reported that the association still needs to continue loading some relief flour to Gaoyou to provide relief in succession.</p>
<h3 id="e106">A Live Drama of Catching an Adulterer <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>First Stealing the Adulteress's Clothes</p>
<p>Then Both Were Bound Up</p>
<p>Planning to Extort Money Through Mediation</p>
<p>Suddenly Discovered and Arrested by the Police</p>
<p>Feng, the wife of Zhao Baocai, a native of Yancheng residing at No. 324 Dongjiaxing Road, is 29 years old, from Yangzhou, and is quite promiscuous. She has been having an affair with Shi Xiaonian, a native of Changzhou residing at No. 63 Miller Road, for four months, but Zhao did not know. The night before, Shi Xiaonian took the opportunity to go to her place for a secret rendezvous, expecting that her husband would definitely not return home. However, someone informed Zhao Baocai, who then gathered his fellow villagers Wu Xuejin, Li Baowen, etc., and secretly went to catch the adulterers around 4:00 a.m. At that time,</p>
<p>A Pair of Lovebirds, Both Naked, Were Sound Asleep. First, Wu Xuejin quietly entered the door and stole her clothes, handing them over to Zhao Baocai to hold as concrete evidence of her adultery. Zhao had always been afraid of his wife and did not dare to act. After a while, Feng woke up and tried to get her clothes to put on, but could not find them. She was surprised and suspected a theft. Shi Xiaonian heard this and jumped up, shouting "Catch the thief!" Zhao, Wu, Li, and others burst into the bedroom and used ropes to bind up the adulterer and adulteress together. First, they pawned Shi Xiaonian's clothes at a pawnshop for nine yuan to pay for the cigarettes and alcohol for those who had helped. Zhao Baocai then extorted a large sum of money from Shi Xiaonian, saying that he would only drop the matter if he paid up, otherwise he would send him to the authorities. Shi had no money and was imprisoned in the room. Wu Xuejin's wife, Wang, acted as an intermediary, going to Shi Xiaonian's house on Miller Road to get money. Unexpectedly, this was discovered by Hou Fulin, a Chinese detective of the Harbin Police Station, who reported to the police chief and,</p>
<p>Together with a Western Detective, Rushed to the Scene and Arrested the Four Men and Women, Wu Xuejin, etc. They first retrieved Shi's clothes from the pawnshop at No. 316 on the same road, ordered him to put them on, and had Feng's clothes given to her by her husband. All were taken to the police station separately and detained. Yesterday, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that the case was complicated, and the police station accused the defendants of crimes such as obstructing freedom, intimidation, theft, and adultery.</p>
<p>He requested that they be punished according to the law and described the details of the case. Then, Central and Western Detectives Ming Yi presented a detailed account, including the clothes and a rope. Wu Xuejin confessed that Zhao Feng and Shi Xiaonian had been having an affair for a long time, and that her husband Zhao Shicai had caught them in the act last night. He denied stealing her clothes and binding her or pawning the clothes. Li Baowen confessed that Zhao had invited him to catch the adulterers, and the rest of his testimony was the same. Zhao Baocai confessed that he did not know that his wife Feng was having an affair with Shi Xiaonian. Last night, when he came home, he saw them sleeping together. He was so angry that he asked Wu Xuejin and Li Baowen to help him bind Shi. He denied the rest. Wu Wang confessed that after Shi Xiaonian was bound, she asked her to go to his house to borrow silver from a friend, but she did not find him, so she returned. She asked for Zhao Feng's confession. Zhao Feng admitted that she had been having an affair with Shi for four months, and the rest of her testimony was evasive. Shi Xiaonian confessed that he,</p>
<p>Had an Ambiguous Relationship with Feng for Several Months. Last night, he happened to be sleeping at her house when Zhao Baocai and others, including Wu and Li and others who were at large, came to catch the adulterers, bound him, and demanded money. Later, Wu Wang persuaded them to settle the matter peacefully. Judge Shen Bingrong verified the testimonies and declared to Zhao Baocai, "Do you want to prosecute Feng and Shi Xiaonian for adultery?" Zhao said that he did not want to pursue the matter. Judge Shen then ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody separately for sentencing on a fixed date.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Changes to the Motorized Bicycle Donation Payment Method <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Announcement by the Municipal Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus</p>
<p>The donation for motorized bicycles in the city was originally set at five yuan per quarter. Due to the narrow body of the bicycles, it was impossible to affix donation plates separately, and only stamps were affixed to the four-season columns of the driver's license as proof. Recently, it has been heard that the Municipal Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus have found that many car owners who have obtained licenses have not paid the quarterly donations and have been riding in a mixed manner. Because there is no identification on the car indicating whether the donation has been paid, and inspecting the licenses of each car is considered troublesome and inconvenient, the inspection is extremely difficult. It is necessary to find a way to remedy this in order to increase the donation revenue. Therefore, after consultation between the bureaus, it is planned to change the motorized bicycle item to an annual donation, following the example of bicycles, with an annual donation of twenty yuan per catty, paid annually, and the license plate will be changed every year without additional charges. If the car owner stops riding after paying the donation, the overpaid donation will be refunded according to the number of overpaid months, calculated at an average of 1.66 yuan per month when the license plate is returned. Those who register and pay the donation after January of each year will also be calculated monthly from the month of donation to the end of the year, so as to be fair and convenient for verification. The change will be implemented from 1932. The bureaus have jointly submitted the plan to the municipal government for approval. Yesterday, the bureaus have announced the plan and issued separate orders to the Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>

<p>Twice into Prostitution</p>
<p>Du Laxiang, a policeman from the Second Precinct of the Second District, found a young woman wandering on the road in Ximen South around 11 p.m. the night before.

When she was three years old, she was abducted and sold to a Du family in the county as a granddaughter. Before a year had passed, Du's wife resold her to a Li family, who took her to Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and other places. Later, she was sold to a Sun family in Jinan, who sent her to a brothel for about three or four years. She escaped to the Kaifeng Relief Society and married a Hu from Zhejiang. He took her to Guangdong. After more than a year, Hu was ordered to leave and arranged for her to wait at his brother's house. However, after a long time, she did not receive a letter. She moved out and made a living selling herself in that area for about half a year. She then married Liu Yaoqi from Xuzhou and came to Nanjing together.

<p>Japan uses barbaric and strong means to brutally abuse our compatriots. Everyone with blood and spirit is furious. However, the anti-Japanese association in Xun is unique in its courage. The five-minute heat has passed. The inspectors from various gangs do not pay attention to the import of Japanese goods at all. In particular, the great silk gang uses a certain excuse to not send people to join. Its intentions can be imagined. Alas, if all places are like the treacherous merchants in Xun, the demise of our country can be expected immediately. The country is in a time of difficulty, and the future is long. Please publish this letter in your newspaper so that the merchants of Jiujiang can read it. It should be a wake-up call to gather a general meeting and start working seriously from now on.</p>
<h3 id="e127">A Certain Gentleman Asks (Regarding. Liuhe. Resistance. To. Japanese. Goods. Not. Effortful) <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>I live in Liuhe Town, which is dozens of miles away from Shanghai. The town is densely populated and there are many shops, but the people's knowledge is not very open. The shops display Japanese goods, which are everywhere. Once I went to a shop to buy a glass, but I saw that the trademarks were all Japanese goods. I asked the shop owner if there were domestic glasses for sale. He replied, "There are no domestic glass glasses." I was angry and returned. The other day, the vegetable shop came to my house to settle the bills. I said to him, "The Japanese have already occupied our three northeastern provinces. The country is about to perish. I advise you not to buy or sell Japanese goods, such as scallop shells and dried shrimps." He said, "What Japanese goods are not Japanese goods? We don't care about the three northeastern provinces or the three western provinces." I found him unreasonable, so I didn't talk to him. Later, I thought that they didn't know the national affairs, and it must be because of lack of knowledge. I thought that it would be best for the organs or schools in Shanghai to send people to various rural areas to give lectures on the details of the Japanese invasion of China, so that they would never import Japanese goods. In this way, it would be a little helpful for the anti-Japanese process. (And reply) If the resistance to Japanese goods only relies on Shanghai's efforts, the inland areas will not respond, and it will definitely not be effective. In the inland areas, transportation is blocked, news is relatively slow, and the harm suffered is not as great as in Shanghai, so it is expected that they will not work hard. However, people with knowledge in the inland areas must be able to understand that the tragedy that Japan staged in the Northeast this time is the prelude to extending to the inland areas. A few days ago, did Japanese sailors forcibly land at the Haizhou port? If they harass the ports along the coast and the Yangtze River, then Jiujiang and Liuhe are likely to be harmed. Do the residents of Liuhe still remember the war in Jiazi year? Jiujiang has suffered countless disasters and floods over the years. Once the Japanese soldiers suddenly arrive, the suffering will be ten times greater than before. If you want to avoid disasters and avenge your shame, you must unite as one and implement an economic boycott policy. Shanghai advocates in the front, and the inland areas respond in the back. If you persevere for a long time, the social economy will be greatly hit, and the Japanese people will complain about the rampant warlords who harm others and harm themselves. In the future, they may be a little more restrained. If you treat the Northeast incident as if it has nothing to do with me, the future strange disasters will definitely come to your own head, and it will be too late to regret it. The incoming letters will be published continuously to awaken the people in various places.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Mr. Feng Runmin Asks (Admonishing. More. Planting. Early. Wheat.) <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Our country has suffered an unprecedented flood this year, covering as many as seventeen provinces. The rice-producing areas have all been flooded. There are great concerns about the problem of national food this year. Although the government is now borrowing wheat from the United States, I think it will not be enough in the end. Although it can be maintained in the past this year, there will still be panic next year. Now that spring ripening is about to be sown, it would be better to plant more early wheat this year, and the food in the summer of the year can reduce a worry. If you plan to plant cotton next year, I don't think it will hinder planting early wheat. I want to ask for your advice on this idea. The current period is about to plant wheat. If the time is missed, it will be useless. Therefore, I sincerely ask you to reply quickly in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your idea is very admirable, but whether there will be enough wheat next year depends on the output of various places and also on how the harvest is in foreign countries. In foreign countries, it is necessary to base on investigation statistics and use numbers to indicate the exact amount of profit and loss, and never rely entirely on ideals. I will publish the incoming letters for the attention of agricultural experts and those who are familiar with business conditions.</p>

<p>Students Returning from Japan</p>
<p>More than 600 Have Returned</p>
<p>Since the Northeast Incident occurred, students studying in Japan have been extremely indignant. Because they could not bear the humiliation of the Japanese and felt that the national disaster was imminent, in addition to those who have successively returned to China voluntarily (more than 500), the Tokyo Institute of Technology, the Tokyo Higher Normal School, and other schools have also decided to withdraw from school and return to China. They have also jointly organized the Republic of China Students Studying in Japan Association with all Japanese students, issued a declaration, and convened representatives from various schools on September 26th to hold a general meeting at the China Youth Hall in Kanda, Tokyo. It was unanimously resolved to return to China and request travel expense subsidies from the embassy and introductions to schools for returning students from the Student Supervision Office. Therefore, more than 100 students returned to Shanghai by boat yesterday. It is also heard that they have requested admission to various national universities. It has been found that national universities have approved to accept as many students from Northeastern University as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e132">League of Nations' Results on China's Request <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Cultural Cooperation Matters</p>
<p>The Chinese government requested the League of Nations on two matters concerning cultural cooperation. It was submitted to the 13th General Assembly of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation and other meetings on June 21st of this year and has had considerable results. Recently, the Ministry of Education translated and reported the League of Nations' document. The original report is very long. The following is a simplified record of its important points:</p>
<p>First, Chen Bulei, Vice Minister of Education of China, wrote to the League of Nations, inquiring about the possibility of obtaining cooperation from various appropriate agencies and departments in the International League of Nations in order to promote cultural and scientific relations between China and other member states of the League of Nations. At least the Chinese side expressed its initial views on this issue. The Vice Minister of Education proposed that it can be carried out in three directions: (A) Methods for developing cultural relations between China and other member states of the League of Nations, especially by promoting the exchange of professors, with special emphasis on those specializing in medicine, natural sciences, and law and political science. (B) Central University wants the League of Nations to help hire a professor of English literature, preferably a British person, and a professor of geography and geology each. It is best to choose from scientists from Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, or Switzerland who can teach in English (the statement stated that Central University can only send a maximum salary of 320 yuan per month for exchange professors, so assistance in other aspects is greatly expected. (C) Finally, the Minister of Education expressed his desire to establish direct relations with the agencies of the League of Nations in charge of cultural issues, and hoped to obtain detailed information on the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation and the Education Film Society, as well as the nature of cooperation that these associations can provide to the Chinese government. The result of the association's discussion: (A) Regarding the possibility of increasing cultural relations between China and other member states of the League of Nations, the association has collected various information on existing relations and methods that can make these relations deeper and more extensive. The association's investigation cannot hope to have any results without a considerable period of time. Therefore, there is no report for the time being, but it can be said that everything is going very smoothly. (B) The association will solicit applications from professors who are willing to go to China and meet the conditions set by the Chinese government. At the same time, it will also formulate methods to fund these professors, including the term of office and the economic security that can be given to make up for the shortage of Central University's salary. (1) In terms of personnel selection, it is expected to be successful in hiring a professor of English literature. In hiring a professor of geology, after careful consideration of the qualifications of each candidate, Professor Ba Dianjiassi of the University of Geneva was recommended to the chairman. A contract will be signed soon and he can teach at Central University at the beginning of the school year. In addition, a professor of geography with German and Austrian nationality informed that Mr. Klebneit, a German professor who taught geography at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong for several years, is still willing to extend his stay in China and is willing to go to Central University in the name of a professor appointed by the League of Nations. All parties agreed and the letter of appointment has been sent. It is hoped that he will accept the appointment immediately. (2) With the consent of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on the economic assistance of the League of Nations, the Association decided that the term of office of the professors in China would be two years. The League of Nations will pay 30,000 Swiss francs per year for the salary of the professors appointed under the special expenses item of the Secretary-General, including the salary sent by Central University.

<p>Shanghai Men Win Championship with Complete Victory over Hong Kong, Four to Zero; Hong Kong Women Win Championship with Complete Victory over Shanghai, Five to Zero; Chinese Woman Luo Wenhui Represents Hong Kong, Men's Doubles Group Today Afternoon. The results of the Shanghai-Hong Kong interport tennis match are as follows: Shanghai men won the championship with a complete victory over Hong Kong. Hong Kong women won the championship with a complete victory over Shanghai. Although the Shanghai men's team's score was 4-0, Shanghai was undoubtedly certain to win today's doubles. The Hong Kong women's team won every match with a score of 5-0. The disparity in strength between the men's and women's teams was exactly the opposite, which is also an interesting fact. Shanghai Wins Men's Championship</p>
<p>One More Group Today</p>
<p>Today, Shanghai men won two more singles matches, bringing the total to 4-0 with a complete victory, regaining the Thai Qide Silver Cup. Luo Wenhui and Fen Que's doubles match against De Fu will be held this afternoon. Shanghai is also certain to win this match.</p>
<p>Jiang and He Battle for Two Hours</p>
<p>Tie After Tie, A Pair of Sticky Candies</p>
<p>Eight to Six</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang (Shanghai) 6-4 He Jia (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Six to Two</p>
<p>At the request of the Hong Kong team, the singles match between Jiang Daozhang and He Jia was held yesterday morning. The doubles match was changed to this afternoon. Although Jiang Daozhang won three straight sets, the match lasted for two hours. Almost every game ended in a tie several times before being resolved. In the first set, Jiang did not fight well, and He won four consecutive games. Jiang tied the score at 4-4, and finally resolved it at 8-6 after 5-5 and 6-6. In the second and third sets, Jiang gradually cheered up, while He did not continue. Both of them made long shots like sticky candies, but they were far from the baseline, a phenomenon of being too careful, so the interest was greatly reduced. In the second and third sets, Jiang had quite a few east-west diagonal balls. He's tactics were not inferior to Jiang, the only difference was that he used less force.</p>
<p>Luo Wenhui Loses to De Fu</p>
<p>Losing Three Straight Sets</p>
<p>Six to One</p>
<p>De Fu (Shanghai) 6-3 Luo Wenhui (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Six to One</p>
<p>Luo Wenhui is a leader in the Hong Kong Chinese tennis world and the captain of the Hong Kong team in this interport match. She took to the court yesterday to compete against De Fu from the Shanghai team. Luo was able to cope with De Fu's fierce serves, but whenever De Fu approached the net, Luo was helpless to block left and right. Luo's forehand was powerful, and her will was calm, so she was able to find a way out in times of crisis, which was appreciated by the audience. The first and third sets were like the Yellow River bursting its banks, rushing thousands of miles, and no amount of effort could save them. In the first set, she only won one game in the fifth game, and in the third set, she only won one game in the third game. Both sets ended in failure with a score of 1-6. In the second set, she struggled slightly. Pan used clever tactics to attack left and right, and De Fu could not get close to the net, so she could not use her blocking skills. As a result, she managed to stay alive, but eventually lost with a score of 3-6.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Hong Kong Retains Women's Championship <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Complete Victory Five to Zero</p>
<p>This group of heroines from Hong Kong's northern expedition were all fierce, and the Shanghai women's army was left with no armor. Today, they won all three groups again, and thus retained the Silver Cup with a score of 5-0. Among them, Chinese Ms. Luo Dezhen did a lot to win glory for Chinese women.</p>
<p>Keilan Wins the Championship in One Battle</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team Already Won Three to Zero</p>
<p>Six to One</p>
<p>Mrs. Keilan (Hong Kong) Mrs. Laai Er (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Six to Two</p>
<p>Mrs. Keilan of Hong Kong defeated Mrs. Laai Er of Shanghai 6-1, 6-2, in the first battle of the morning. Together with the two groups on the first day, Oyster Port had won three groups, and thus retained the women's team championship. Mrs. La was completely running under Mrs. Ke's net shots, sometimes east, sometimes west, heavy and powerful. Mrs. La only won the third game in the first set and the second and third games in the second set. The Shanghai French women who were supporting the match shouted "Lose, lose!" Helen Miss of China</p>
<p>Miss Kolaisha Sighs Self-inferiority</p>
<p>Six to Two</p>
<p>Ms. Luo Dezhen (Hong Kong) Ms. Kolaisha (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Six to One</p>
<p>The first group in the afternoon was Ms. Luo Dezhen's 6-2, 6-1 victory over Ms. Kolaisha of Shanghai. Although the outcome was no longer related to the championship, the Shanghai women still had the determination not to be completely defeated. Ms. Luo is Luo Wenhui's sister, and she is well-known in Hong Kong. After the Far Eastern Games last year, Ms. Li Lian, the champion of the National Games singles, went to Hong Kong, and Luo defeated Li 6-0, 6-0, leaving her without a trace. Therefore, although Kolaisha is a well-known female general in Shanghai, she had no resistance under the confrontation. Luo's powerful diagonal shots, exploring deep and far into the corner bottom, and suddenly bing, suddenly west's two side line balls, came one after another. Running and even air balls, high balls, were all excellent. Every time she fired an extremely deep corner ball, she immediately rushed up to smash. Sometimes it was an extremely right ball, and with a wave, it became extremely left. Miss Kolaisha, at this point, sighed that she was not as good. The meeting collapsed both inside and outside, and praised her in unison, calling her the Helen Wilson Miss of China, which is really not an exaggeration.

<p>(Hong Kong) 6-2 (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Mrs. Totenham 6-1 Ms. Kolaisha</p>
<p>In the Shanghai-Hong Kong women's competition, the Hong Kong team was always at an advantage, and the situation was overwhelmingly one-sided. However, Luo Dezhen and Mrs. Totenham were different from Feiers and Ms. Kolaisha. Hong Kong team Totenham had pneumonia, and Luo Dezhen was seen to be carrying a heavy burden, sometimes taking care of both left and right, and taking care of the front and back. The Hong Kong team won, and the Chinese Helen Miss Luo Dezhen made a great contribution. The Shanghai team can be said to be very unfortunate. In the first set, they won 6-4, thanks to the blocking. From the second set onwards, the Hong Kong team guarded the border from afar, waiting for the opportunity to move. Miss Luo's shooting was powerful, and with the help of her teammates, the momentum was unstoppable, and she won with 6-2, 6-1.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Gold Market Soars Last Week <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Settlement Price Has Been Changed to US Exchange Rate as Standard</p>
<p>Swap Extended for One Month is Favorable to Short Positions</p>
<p>Squeeze Long Head Higher Forty-Three or Four Taels The standard gold price suddenly soared last week, fluctuating from weakness to increase and was full of turbulence. It fluctuated twenty or thirty taels a day. This was because the overseas silver market rose and then fell, especially since the settlement price has been changed to the US exchange rate as the standard. People's hearts tended to be firm, and the market price suddenly increased, almost squeezing long positions and hedging, so it suddenly rushed out of 740 taels from within 700 taels, about 70 taels in retrospect. According to statistics, it rose forty-three or four taels, so the swap was not done on October 16 of this year, but was extended for one month. Now, the mixed transaction for November and December is done, waiting for the implementation of December swapping for January starting on November 16. Only this method gives the short side a great advantage; otherwise, all short positions must be posted, and the market price is still high and very stimulating. However, this kind of situation has rarely been seen before. After that, the market situation began to be peaceful. By the weekend, both long and short sides had mutual control. As for the exchange rate, it was complicated and varied. The British pound was loose and the US dollar was tight. The gold industry generally had to pull back the shilling to flatten the position, but the US dollar was thrown out to cover the gap. It was found that the trend in the middle of this week was obviously loose and secretly tight, and the settlement price was the US exchange rate, which everyone paid attention to. At present, about 90 taels have been pressed. The recent transaction volume of the exchange is about 22,000 to 23,000 taels. Yesterday (4th), the big gap suddenly increased. Today (5th), the gold market may have changed. The following is a summary of the situation in the past six days.</p>
<p>There were dozens of taels of fluctuations in the market every day. Since Monday (September 28), the big gap silver suddenly shrank three pence one two five, the silver price shrank two cents two five, the shilling was extended by one level, and the domestic market was also hard. Chinese merchants pulled British pounds and threw US dollars, and the gold market opened at 688 taels, slightly less than one tael. After that, it rose immediately, and the long side turned worry into joy and the short side was greatly disappointed. It once broke through 700 taels at 03 taels. After the air was not good, it plunged more than 20 taels due to the situation at noon, totaling 677 taels and a half. The market closed well at 67 taels, totaling 84 taels and 2 qian. In the afternoon, it opened at 86 taels, reached 74 taels, and recovered to 80 taels. The exchange rate was rising, and the market closed at 75 taels and a half, continuing to decrease by 13 taels and a half compared to last Saturday. The market fluctuated by 29 taels before and after. The next day, the gap was not changed, the silver price was slightly decreased by one two five, the shilling was as before, the US dollar was extended by three seven five to squeeze the exchange rate. The domestic market was tight, and the shilling was still being pulled up, while the US dollar was being thrown out. The daily gold was also being released, mostly hedging. The standard gold price rose by 15 taels and a half at the initial opening, totaling 691 taels. It was because the big gap looked long the day before but failed, and people's hearts were rising. After that, it was 97 taels, but the selling power retreated by 10 taels, totaling 86 taels and 2 qian. The noon closing suddenly became 94 taels and 8 qian. In the afternoon, after 97 taels, the short side was greatly embarrassed due to the efforts of the big players and the motion to change the settlement price to the US dollar, and they rushed to buy in, so it reached 707 taels and a half. The closing price returned to the flat price, 703 taels and 6 qian, which was 28 taels and 1 qian higher than the previous day. The total difference in the city was 21 taels and 3 qian. The big gap on Wednesday was still unchanged, the silver market decreased by another half cent, the shilling was as before, the US dollar was listed at a larger one two five, but the domestic market was tight and rising. Because several US banks went bankrupt and India levied silver tax, people's hearts were upward. The standard gold price was initially flat at 702 taels, but the gross market shouted over 700 taels. Afterwards, the more buying, the more it rose by more than 10 taels. British and American exchange bills also rose, once reaching 731 taels. The closing price was 22 taels in the afternoon, and then 37 taels due to the sharp drop in Indian exchange, and then 35 taels and 5 qian, continuing to rise by 31 taels and 9 qian. In one day, there were 36 taels of ups and downs. Foreign and overseas Chinese had just filled the short position, and it was heard that the swap was advanced to October 5. On Thursday, the big gap shrank by 1875, the silver market was 625, the shilling was one level, the domestic market was loose, and the industry was still throwing US dollars and pulling shillings. The initial opening of the gold market was slightly increased by three taels and a half, totaling 739 taels. After a while, there were many transactions, and it plunged by more than 10 taels, totaling 22 taels. It then jumped to 40 taels due to vigorous buying. It suddenly retreated to 29 taels due to the unloading by Da Xing Yong and Dai Qiao Rifu. The noon closing was 31 taels and a half. The afternoon opening was 31 taels, followed by 26 taels and a half. The closing price was 30 taels, which was 5 taels and a half lower than the previous day. The market fluctuated by 18 taels before and after. On Friday, the big gap shrank by another 25, the US silver price increased by half a cent, the shilling remained unchanged, the US dollar was listed at a larger three seven five, and the domestic market also saw an increase. The industry was still pulling the shilling and selling the bonus. The standard gold price opened at 27 taels, a slight decrease of three taels. Afterwards, a big player, Wu, competed to buy, and the high price reached 42 taels. The noon closing was 33 taels. The afternoon was 32 taels, followed by 3 taels and 3 qian. Then, Da Xing Yong sold, and it retreated to 24 taels. The closing price was 27 taels and 7 qian, which fluctuated by 18 taels. On Saturday, the big gap was not changed, the US dollar was slightly shrunk, the shilling was as before, the US dollar was listed at a smaller half yuan, and the domestic market was mixed with British growth and US shrinkage. The gold market opened at 32 taels, an increase of 4 taels and 3 qian. It then fluctuated from 34 taels to 28 taels, with the selling side being active. Afterwards, it seemed to be rising, once reaching 36 taels. Later, the ups and downs were uncertain, but there were no large transactions on the table. The closing price was 32 taels and a half, which was 4 taels and 8 qian higher than the previous day. There were also 8 taels of ups and downs in half a day. The high and low prices of British, American, Indian silver market and British and American exchange bills are listed below.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>The Bond Market Situation Was Serious Last Week</p>
<p>November Futures Failed to Open</p>
<p>The Atmosphere Was Calm, then Fell Greatly</p>
<p>Last week (from September 28th to October 3rd), the bond market situation at the local Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, apart from being closed for the first two days of the week to settle September futures, only had four market days in the entire week. Although November futures were scheduled to open after the settlement, the exchange, concerned about the current unstable market situation, required physical delivery for all November futures to limit speculative selling. Therefore, although November futures had opened, there were no transactions throughout. Even October futures saw little activity, significantly less than the previous week. The total daily trading volume was mostly less than 10 million, and on Wednesday, the trading volume was only 2.8 million, totaling only 30.52 million for the week, a decrease of over 12 million yuan compared to the previous week. This was because trading in all bonds was scarce. As for the trend of bond prices during the week, on Wednesday, due to the continuous lack of positive developments in the diplomatic situation, people felt uneasy and generally sought to sell. Therefore, all bonds, except for the 1929 and 1936 issues, were suspended from trading due to sharp declines at the opening. The situation improved slightly on Thursday, with short sellers covering their positions and some small investors buying at lower prices, pushing prices up by about three yuan. This was because it was confirmed that there was hope for a peaceful resolution with Guangdong, making the market optimistic. On Friday, the market weakened again, but the trend was relatively stable. On the last day of the week, market sentiment was weak again, and bond prices fell by about one and a half yuan. Overall, prices only rose on one of the four days, and the remaining days saw continuous declines, resulting in a significant drop compared to the previous week, ranging from three to four or five yuan. Only the 1936 issue fell by only 8 jiao and 5 fen, the Customs Duty bonds fell by 1 yuan and 8 jiao, and spot Salt Tax bonds, with no trading for a long time, fell by as much as 15 yuan compared to the opening price at the beginning of last month. Looking at the market situation, it is difficult to expect a turnaround in the short term. The following table shows the high, low, rise, and fall of bond prices for the four days (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e146">Cotton Yarn Market Firm Last Week <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Stocks Too Depleted... Many New Long Positions</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market was firm last week, mainly because the anti-Japanese patriotic movement is becoming increasingly heated. Japanese yarn cannot circulate, and the sales of Chinese yarn have soared, showing a meteoric rise. Relying solely on domestic yarn is insufficient to meet demand, and the market is steadily rising. The situation is becoming increasingly tight, and short sellers are showing signs of panic. Some have had to cut their losses, causing prices to rise by five taels in two days. Later, a certain merchant, unwilling to raise prices, sold off some inventory during the涨, temporarily suppressing the market. Prices fell by two or three taels in one day. In general, stocks are too depleted, and the output of Chinese yarn is too small. When prices fall, new buyers step in again. There are rumors in the market that Indian merchants are taking long positions again, but some say that the number of purchases is very small. However, based on the overall trend, there is no possibility of a large price increase, entirely due to the shortage of goods and the inability to supply sufficient quantities. Current yarn sales are sluggish due to high prices, and there is no significant activity among merchants. The prices of standard yarn for various months are two or three taels higher than the previous week.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Chinese Cotton Market Encroached Upon by Foreign Cotton <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>American Cotton Firms Selling at Low Prices</p>
<p>Han Standard Cotton May Be Squeezed This Month</p>
<p>The American cotton market has been in a slump, with prices seemingly falling without end. The reasons for this are that the new cotton crop is increasing due to favorable weather conditions, and the global economy is sluggish, with consumption decreasing rather than increasing, making it difficult to sustain prices. New low prices are gradually emerging, breaking the 6-cent opening price. The October contract has fallen to 5.43 cents. It is difficult to determine when it will stabilize. However, the local cotton market has not been significantly affected. For October standard cotton, some Han merchants still have plans to squeeze short sellers due to the lack of supply. The forward contracts are being held up by them. However, the sales of spot cotton have been completely encroached upon by foreign cotton. American cotton is being sold at increasingly low prices, and foreign firms are willing to make special concessions. However, factories are wary of the treacherous global trends and are not daring to purchase in large quantities. In the future, both Indian and American cotton in Shanghai will face the problem of oversupply. The spot price of American cotton is only 25 taels (in the US). This cotton can be used as raw material for yarn of 32 counts or higher. Therefore, speculators and manufacturers are purchasing foreign cotton to hedge against standard cotton. Currently, this can be sustained because the supply from various regions is scarce, but in the future, there is bound to be a sharp drop in prices. American cotton is down 60 pounds from the previous week. Factories have purchased about 20,000 bales of Indian and American cotton, and very little Chinese cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e148">American Cotton Falls, British and Indian Cotton Rise <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to active selling, but later recovered slightly due to some buying by manufacturers. The futures contract fell by 12 to 14 points, and the spot price fell by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 25 points, and the spot price rose by 23 points. Egyptian cotton spot price rose by 45 points. Indian cotton was firm due to good opening prices in Liverpool. The Pingguo contract rose by 2.75 rupees, the Omlar contract rose by 3.5 rupees, and the Bailuo Creek contract rose by 3.75 rupees.

<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear fellow countrymen. Westerners have a very common slang term. When they see someone acting cowardly, they call it "Yellow." What is the relationship between this word, which originally means "yellow" in English, and "cowardly"? It's puzzling. After much contemplation, I've come up with an answer. They originally looked down on the yellow race and saw that many yellow people were cowardly. Therefore, they directly called cowardice "Yellow." However, I dare to say that this "yellow race" definitely doesn't refer to Japan. With their small three islands, they defeated our great country and then defeated powerful Russia. The spirit of "praying for death in battle" was so brave. Therefore, Westerners calling cowardice "Yellow" must refer to the 400 million citizens of our great Republic of China. My fellow countrymen, think about it, think about it again. Can you not feel heartbroken?</p>

<p>Having arrived at the destination, I thought for a moment: If I die! What will my old mother's sorrow be like? What will be the pain of my wife and children? What are society's hopes and criticisms of me? Before thoroughly answering these questions, I can only temporarily endure and die later! So I ran back home, and it was already the time of the rooster's crow. My old mother was sitting there, sighing and lamenting, her eyes anxiously watching for her beloved son to return home before she could feel at ease and go to sleep. My virtuous wife was sitting next to the dim lamplight, her hands diligently sewing stitch after stitch, mending clothes, shoes, and socks for her children, husband, and mother-in-law, waiting for her husband to return. As soon as I stepped into the gate, my old mother immediately cried out, "Girl! Girl! Where have you been? You only come back at this time!" My virtuous wife said, "Why do you only come home at this time?" And they both said in unison, "Next time, come back earlier to save us from anxiously waiting and having our hearts broken and our courage shattered." Then came the inquiries about cold and warmth, asking about hunger and thirst, and then scalding hot tea was brought to my lips; hot rice was placed on the table, and they both shouted, "Eat! Eat! Eat a little!" Sometimes I would stammer and mumble a few words and go to sleep. Sometimes I wouldn't say a word and would pull the covers over my head and sleep. This happened no less than ten times. Until now, how would my old mother know that her beloved son has returned from rebirth?! How would my virtuous wife know that she is sleeping with a reanimated corpse?! Although the children are now grown adults, they were a group of little babies at the time, their soft snores making their beautiful dreams, and how would they know that they were about to become fatherless? In the end, I figured it out... dying is not enough to face the future! My old mother would faint and fall to the ground! My virtuous wife would hang herself and follow me to the underworld! My children would be displaced and homeless! Society cultivated me into an adult, but I haven't repaid society, and dying like this would be a great loss to society! I decided not to die and to live on.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Two Brave Men Who Resisted the Japanese Pirates <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Now, the tyrannical Japanese have occupied our country and slaughtered our people. However, those in power still adhere to a policy of non-resistance, seemingly taking retreat as advancement, as if this is the only way to deal with the situation. However, the rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every citizen. Can our people just listen to the enemy's slaughter, endure for a moment, and sit and wait to die under the wooden clogs, gunpowder, and rain of bullets? If you are not descendants of the Yellow Emperor, I would not be surprised. Otherwise, I know that in the end, you will have the determination to save and defend yourselves. Therefore, I have examined past events and found two men in Shanghai who are truly capable of inspiring the courage to resist Japan today. Their stories are narrated below.</p>
<p>Mu Yilang disguised himself to scout the enemy. Mu Yilang was a Shanghai native who lived in a humble village. He made a living by begging. When the Japanese pirates arrived, he took on the task of spying. He painted his face with colorful powder and covered his body with paint, pretending to be a leper. He begged among the pirates. The pirates did not know. They associated with him. Over time, he was able to discern the number of pirates and their locations. Later, he reported this to the officials, who were prepared. He was able to annihilate them in one fell swoop. The pirates' advance was slightly curbed, largely due to the efforts of this beggar.</p>
<p>The Bravery of Monk Wang Sanhe. Wang Sanhe was also a Shanghai native. He was tall and strong. He learned the tofu business in the eastern town of Fahua. During the late Ming Dynasty, roving soldiers looted food. One day, they came to Wang's place and demanded soy milk. Wang pretended to agree. After a while, he lifted two seven-stone vats, filled them with water, and carried them to the edge of the shore. He tricked the soldiers into carrying them in. The soldiers looked at each other and dared not look him in the eye. They all retreated and left. They never came back. During the early Qing Dynasty, some people, posing as Japanese pirates, came from the Puhuitang and plundered. Before leaving, they forced scholars to carry their luggage. Wang was also captured. When they reached the riverbank, he glared and shouted at the pirates, "You rats! If you can defeat me with strength, I will give you the goods. Otherwise, die!" The pirates clamored and charged forward. Wang then threw their leader into the water, making gurgling sounds. Many others sank in turn until they were afraid to advance and scattered and fled. Because of this, the name of Monk Wang Sanhe shook the streets of Shanghai, and the neighborhood relied on him for safety for decades. When he died, he was buried south of Zhong'an Bridge. Later, his grave was destroyed, and some saw his body. His arm was said to have been a single bone.</p>

<p>— Wang Shaozeng</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Weizhi of Dachang has outstanding moral character and writing, and is highly respected in the Southeast. He once served as the president of Nanyang University and is still praised by the scholars. After becoming blind, he retired to Wuxi. Later, he founded the National College, continuing the scholarly style of Gao Gu and advocating personality education for the world. Mr. Gu, although old and feeble, has a strong spirit and is no less than the young and strong. Mr. Bu Yi eats simple vegetarian food and attends class every day, regardless of wind or snow, for more than ten years as one day. Usually, when lecturing to students, he always earnestly encourages them to restore people's hearts, avenge shame, and save the country. During the Battle of Jinan, Mr. Deng spoke on the altar and wept and sighed. He discussed the urgency of the current situation and the strategy of saving the country. Everyone present wept. At that time, there was a classmate named Xu Jun Cheng Hou, a chivalrous man. In a crowded seat, he cut his arm and wrote in blood, vowing to repay the country with death. He left a suicide note to the Anti-Japanese Alliance. Commentators were all admired. Therefore, all the students in the school tightened their belts for a month, and the surplus food was used for national skills and military training. Mr. Zeng's moral sentiment is so profound. However, Mr. Zeng often said to the students: "In the past, Zigong said, 'It is clumsy to have no intention of repaying others and causing people to suspect you. It is dangerous to have the intention of repaying others and letting people know it. It is dangerous to hear about things before they happen.' These few sentences can be called a famous theory for thousands of years. This is why the more the Vietnamese can destroy Wu. Our people know shame or not." It can be said that the words are so emotional. Mr. Once changed Yue Wumu's half-time, Jiang Hong to sing by himself. The lyrics said: "The Republic of China is ashamed. The snow has not yet fallen. Our party hates. When will it be released? Drive a long car and step through the Maguan Mountain Pass. The lofty aspirations are hungry and eat the meat of DaKuma. Laughing and talking, drinking the blood of Tanaka. Wait for the old mountains and rivers from the beginning. New China." Slightly changed the number of words. As from new casting. Its boldness and tragedy, dripping with joy. Although old, the heart is not old. It is heard that after the wine is finished, Mr. Will often sing tragically, the voice is like a bell, and the listener is terrified. Mr. Is almost a heartbroken man today. At this juncture, the mountains and rivers of the Northeast were invaded by the Japanese. Our compatriots are still unaware. How can we wake them up like Mr. One by one? (But pay)</p>
<h3 id="e153">Select War Dogs <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>A nation without a solution, how can it have a government with a solution? The League of Nations is hopeless. The people are distraught and weeping, and should blame and punish themselves. Self-defense and self-help. At this critical moment, the people of the whole country should each establish their goals, do their best, and express their opinions. Yu is also incompetent. I would like to discuss the issue of war dogs with the people of the country. In May 1915, Oudan sent dogs to the battlefield, with a total of 1,678 heads. The United Kingdom, recognizing the merits of German dogs, followed suit in 1917 and trained them for departure. As a result, the number of dogs on the battlefield increased sharply in the belligerent countries. There are four conditions for selecting war dogs in various countries. First, a healthy body. Second, intelligent intelligence. Third, courageous courage. Fourth, obey orders. At first, Germany used curly-haired dogs. PoodlE is intelligent. It is a pity that it is nearsighted. And fear of the scorching sun. It was changed to AiredIE. AIredier Terrier Tao Banman. Doberman pins Xia. Pinsheer Laut Hui Lei RottweiIer. And German Police Dog German Shepherd. The British sheep dog is classic. ColIie lurks a dachshund. Lurcher Shepherd. Sheepdog fetch retriever. RetrievER and AI Tuier and other service forward.</p>
<p>First, among the dogs, the German police dog is the most qualified, and Yu strongly advocates that our country can choose this dog to fight. This dog is the best breed in modern times. Its place of origin is Arlonnes, which borders Germany and France. At first, it was named after the place name. Commonly known as "wolf dog." Because of its wolf shape, the famous dog on the screen Ling Dingding belongs to this category. In recent years, Japanese people have been devoted to raising this species. Good for others to do what other dogs can do. Those who cannot be used for other dogs. Although the climate is hot and humid. Blizzards and snow. The temperature dropped to 15 degrees below zero. Still competent and happy. Chasing a horse. No fatigue. Eight miles. Seven</p>
<p>Minute arrives. If it is over the flood and waves, it will also arrive in one moment. The memory is strong. Nothing can be added. By car and by car, the road is far away. And can predict the wind and tide. Inform the owner. Strong and strong. Endure hunger and thirst. This is beyond the reach of other dogs. The Greek poet Sophocles praised the tracing dog Jvackin</p>

<p>— Yang Du</p>
<p>Yang Xizi (Du)'s name is known throughout the world. Slander also followed. His name began with the old man Xiangqi saying that he was beautiful in writing. Wonderful in words. Later, he once traveled with Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. He is also a constitutionalist. In the late Qing Dynasty, he was elected to the Zizheng Yuan. Discuss the draft criminal law. With Songjiang Lei Fenwu, Meng Zhaochang of Wujin, he stood up to argue against the opposing party. Eloquent, if the river is determined. And the name is getting more and more prominent. At that time, the fake constitution used the cabinet to deceive the people. The cabinet established the four bureaus of system, edict, law, system, statistics, and printing. Du Ren served as the deputy director of the law and system. Transfer to the Director of the Statistics Bureau. Not what Du wanted. In the year of Xinhai. Xiangcheng sent Tang Shaoyi and Yang Shiqi to the south to negotiate peace. Du followed. The people should want it. Du Wen reported. Hurrying north. Xiangcheng has taken the temporary presidential position. Zhendu is going smoothly. Come and go in the house without obstruction. Whenever a cabinet meeting is held. Du Chang has the voice of the minister. One day. Xiangcheng Zhao Duwang. Suddenly said. Learning and custom are thin. Fluctuate from time to time. We should get those who know the times to teach education. Yu measures it for a long time. Decide to subordinate Si Xi to My Son. There are many students who are good at arguing. It must be as eloquent as Zizi. The beginning is sufficient to perform the task happily. Du Surong to Bai. Minister of Education. Leisurely also. I am willing to help. Do not help. Xiangcheng sneered and said. As Zi Yan, abandon wealth and two departments. They are all worthless. Du Fu said. Not this is the reason. The day of serving the country is long. The year of doing business is Yong. Focus on responsibility. Shame is to be idle. Xiangcheng said. Zi Qie is waiting for it. What I hope for Zi is also infinite. degree back. Xiangcheng Gu Shiqi said. Xizi is not willing to live under people. So see it. I was very happy with his talent. Constitution. Creating a base for planning security. Although named in Du. Those who plan the account are actually Guo Yansun (Shi Yi). Shiyi Tian Wulu participated in the case of the fierce abduction of a certain actor to Xishan and invited Yuan Yuntai (Keding) to the meeting. Keding once wanted to get closer to a certain actor, but he could not help being overjoyed, so he secretly discussed the matter of constitutional monarchy. Keding said to Shiyi. Xizi used to advocate the monarch's constitution. It can be conspired with. Publicly plan to support and give the responsibility of writing to Xizi Shiyi said. good. Calculated. At dawn. Visit each other. Du shouted. If you go, you will hurry. If something happens, we are in danger. In less than three days, Du wrote a theory on saving the country through the constitution of the monarchy and published it in newspapers. The Western consul from the government followed suit. The name of the Planning Security Conference spread far and wide. At that time, Sun Shao Hou (Yukyun) hoped to use things and Hu Jingwu (Ying) looked haggard. Speaking in favor of his theory. Ying is kind to the villagers Li Xiehe. Speaking of the actions of Xiehe is also the first to hear Du Fu induced Liu Shenshu (Shi Pei) Yan Youling (Fu) Zhang to support him. Pei Nuo. Fu hesitated. Zuo said. How many years of human life. I am old and I will try it for the world to be known as the six gentlemen of Hongxian. In the past few years. Yu once passed Gu Shang. Speaking of Jiang Dengxuan as a man. Said to be a general. Asked Zhang Zongchang and others, he said, "Drunk and friend-loving friends are more than one year older. Letter to the sea. He signed Hu Gong but did not name him (Hu Gong. His other name. Not commonly used in his early years.) He was not rich in life and died in worry. His talent is a pity for his encounter. It is even more sad.</p>
<p>a few slogans that people used to encourage themselves</p>
<p>— Yu Ku</p>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. On the first day of BingShen. The first doctor went to knock on Yushan Weng Wengong's residence in Jingdi. See his front door. Taofu is brand new. The dazzling ten characters said. The unicorn wants to think of a thousand miles. Wren borrows a branch. The large characters are majestic and vigorous. I have never seen it before. And its dirty and uneven air. Beyond words. It is also issued with reservations. Is it also the beginning of today's slogan? Moreover, the public is a virtuous and prosperous generation. Articles and politics. Guanjue ancient and modern. Shu Mingyou is full of the world. In the capital day. His door couplets. Must be changed every year. Be sure to cut the current affairs. Or cut off your identity. A good story spread. Moved the court and the wild. Its magical power to infect people. Or even more than today's slogan. Yuan Xiangcheng. The claim to be an emperor misled the country. People still regret it today. However, if it is not a matter of importance to people. Judging only by his talent. Then his martial arts are transcendent. And the literary talent is also not weak. Yu once saw his condolence to Pan's martyr. The words are bright. The words are quite heroic. The original Ba Yun. Pan Sheng Ziyin. Returned from Japan. Came out of Incheon. Feeling Korean affair. Extremely angry and threw himself into the sea. Missed the opportunity. End with hatred. Those who smell his wind. When taking the heart of life as the heart. Finish his unfinished ambition. This is the way to do well for students. etc. Lian said. "My son is gone. What about the robe? It is a pity that the aspirations lightly give birth. It turns into an angry wave and flies into the sea. All of you, please work hard. Every man is responsible. May the National Team be formed. Common support of Yilu to save the day." See this. In the era of the Republic of China. Sheng Chuan Xiangcheng. There is quite an ambition to fight the Japanese invaders. Not without reason.</p>
<p>On September 16, the year of the Republic of China. For Xiangcheng's birthday. All properties compete to congratulate each other with parallel diction. Praising merit and virtue. Cumbersome. Yuan made a couplet and said. "The system of governing and protecting the country. Every man is responsible. Losing the country and destroying the species. At that time, I was guilty." The commentators admired the greatness of their sense of responsibility. And Anzhi's imperial system is self-explanatory.</p>

<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>"Old monk, I am deeply attached to that past peaceful era of one or two hundred years ago. Please, with your great compassion, let me sit on this revolving chair and experience that 18th-century China."</p>
<p>"Layman, if you wish to experience that past peace, you need only sit on the chair, and you will find yourself in its midst. However, this old monk has something to advise. China's various failures have distant causes and recent causes. I ask you to observe the distant causes. Once you sit on the chair, you will become a person of one or two hundred years ago. Do not lose your true nature. If you feel any dissatisfaction, you need only call out for the monk of the Unobstructed Hermitage, and this old monk can assist you in escaping that past environment."</p>
<p>"I will follow the old monk's guidance in all things."</p>
<p>Thus, the old monk invited Mr. Tao Chi to sit on the revolving chair. Against the Earth's rotation, he gave it a push, and the chair began to spin incessantly. Tao Chi felt dizzy and disoriented; everything disappeared. He only heard the whirring of wind in his ears! When he came to a stop and opened his eyes, he had become a newly successful scholar named Tao Chi, also sixteen years old, in Shandong Province, China, in the 18th century. Although his origins were humble, his family had been scholars for generations, and he held a respectable position in Jinan City.</p>
<p>It was strange! The Tao Chi who had not sat on the revolving chair was the Tao Chi with a 20th-century mindset. Once he sat on the revolving chair, he became the Tao Chi with an 18th-century old mindset. At this time, he firmly believed in the "Three Have" doctrine in books: "In books, there is a thousand Zhong of millet; in books, there are houses of gold; in books, there are faces of jade." Moreover, this "book" referred only to the narrow definition of books, specifically the Four Books, the Five Classics, and the Eight-legged Essay and model test pieces that were tools for the imperial examinations. All other books related to practical matters of state were excluded, unworthy of a glance, and deemed detrimental to success in the imperial examinations. As for what was called "science is all-powerful" and "survival of the fittest," Tao Chi had deeply studied these things before sitting on the revolving chair. Once he turned back the clock and caught up with the 18th century, Tao Chi's thoughts changed with the times! He only knew that the imperial examinations were all-powerful. He only knew that those who passed the examinations and gained official rank were the fittest, and those who failed were the failures. He knew nothing else. He had been baptized by the imperial examinations; he was a loyal believer in the Eight-legged Essay.</p>

<p>— Gan Yuqing</p>
<p>Go, to the battlefield!</p>
<p>The three northeastern provinces are no longer our homeland; our homeland is trapped as a battlefield for killing bandits. The battlefield is imprinted with the bloodstains of our brave warriors; the bloodstains indicate that this war is about to begin. Go, to the battlefield!</p>
<p>Recognize clearly, it is the mask of the imperialists. The bellies of jackals have no hearts for scorched earth. In this world, only might makes right; only from the mouths of guns can justice be spoken. Go, to the battlefield! Everything depends on our own efforts; everything depends on our own struggles. Open your eyes and see what time it is. The broadsword is held to our necks. Go, to the battlefield! Do not play tunes of despair; and do not fear how many enemies there are. Great sacrifices lead to great success; monuments must be created with flesh and blood. Go, to the battlefield! Our hot blood is boiling; our bodies are like madmen. We will use our hot blood to rust the enemy's gun barrels; we will use our bodies to plug the enemy's cannons. Go, to the battlefield! Relying on our courage, relying on our spirit of pure love, we will drive out the enemy; no, we will kill all the enemies!</p>
<h3 id="e157">September 22nd <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Hong</p>
<p>Today is the morning of September 22nd. We paced back and forth in the corridor, discussing the atrocities of the Japanese occupation of Southern Manchuria, our hearts filled with anger, as if burning and swelling within. Suddenly, we were startled by the school bell, and thought of going to the first class, of going to the lifeless algebra class. This was a class taught by a cold and emotionless old teacher. We felt great pain, forced to sit there, listening to the monotonous voice of the teacher, reciting algebraic equations, while at the same time, our hearts were burning with the Sino-Japanese Incident. This was such a contradictory situation, such an unbearable situation, yet we had to endure this imprisonment for a time.</p>
<p>Just then, we saw the nearly sixty-year-old teacher walking towards us in the distance, holding a roll call book and an algebra book in his hands. We became even more angry. Normally, although we disapproved of his cold and emotionless demeanor, we still pitied his old age. But today, it had turned into deep disgust. The word "puppet" burst from the mouth of one student, followed by another student's cry of "old machine." So we rushed into the classroom, sat up straight, and waited for the teacher with fiery and angry eyes. These eyes seemed to want to swallow a person whole. Indeed, in an instant, inexplicably, our old teacher had become our great enemy.</p>
<p>However, at the moment the old teacher stepped into the classroom doorway, we were slightly shocked. His usual dull and stiff appearance was gone; one could even say he was agile. He leaped onto the podium in two or three steps, no longer solemnly holding up the roll call book as usual. Instead, his sleepy, shy eyes, which never dared to look at us, suddenly widened, his pupils moving and radiating light. Clearly, in an instant, he had sharply looked at each and every student. What was this scene? Our nerves tightened, feeling that something was bound to happen.</p>
<p>He held the algebra book in his hand, his body trembling, becoming more and more severe. Suddenly, with a "thud," he placed the book on the table, followed by a sound like "crackling." He shouted the words "Compatriots!" This was a sudden attack on us. We felt the room seemed to be shaking. In our confused minds, we wondered if this was really the teacher's voice. Was this possible? That voice, originally carrying the air of the earth, had suddenly become so loud and clear. As if we were carefully watching his lips, his lips were also trembling, shouting, "Our country has reached a critical moment... has suffered great insults from the Japanese... Do you know, even a common man would draw his sword in the face of insult, let alone our four hundred million people, how can we endure the tyranny of the Japanese islands?... The great land of China, will never be a place for the Japanese to show off their military might!... Rise up, my compatriots!... We must see if justice will ultimately lose to power!"</p>
<p>His voice was intermittent, surging in our ears like waves. His short voice burst out with such a long string of shouts. His body seemed about to burst, flying to the ceiling. His soft, never-red face was now flushed and swollen. Sweat dripped from his bald, shiny forehead, which we usually used as talking points. In his bright red eyes, tears were also flowing. These were not tears of sorrow or fear, these were tears of excitement, these were tears of courage.</p>
<p>Our hearts trembled violently, and we were also shedding tears, deeply ashamed and remorseful that we had just treated him with angry eyes. These eyes could not be taken back. But at the same time, we were also shedding tears of joy, as if we had suddenly rediscovered a long-lost loved one, as if the isolated army trapped in enemy territory had suddenly had reinforcements descend from the sky. How joyful we were! Our teacher was not a puppet after all. How full of gratitude we were! Our teacher's long-lost fire of youth, was now burning again. Our teacher had truly been reborn!</p>
<p>At this time, we could also hear the teacher's rapid, gasping breath. Through our blurred, tearful eyes, we saw a strand of white hair at the teacher's temples being blown by the morning breeze from the parade grounds. We also saw the teacher's thin chest, in the wide long gown, rising and falling sharply. Gradually, he began to pant, followed by a fit of coughing.</p>
<p>A warm voice came from among us: "Teacher, rest for a while, you're overexerting yourself!"</p>
<p>"No! Don't look down on people! Don't mistake me for being old, thinking I'm useless... I'm still very strong, and I can still strive!"</p>
<p>Saying this, he patted his thin, hunched shoulders, making a "click" sound. He clenched his two fists tightly and repeated loudly,</p>
<p>"I'm still very strong, and I can still strive!..."</p>
<p>"And, besides, we are here too!"</p>
<p>The whole classroom rang out together.</p>
<p>Petition by Yunren</p>
<p>The wind is howling, the Huangpu River is cold.</p>
<p>If our goal is not achieved, we vow not to return.</p>
<p>A dim, green electric light reflected a strong brilliance from the surrounding white walls. Because the room was small, it appeared even brighter. Everyone else in the dormitory had gone out, leaving only a lonely me, tossing and turning in bed. Even the usually bustling dormitory – the endless sound of wooden clogs hitting the floor, the sound of water being poured in someone's room, the sound of musical instruments, the sound of laughter... all seemed to have quieted down, without a single sound.</p>
<p>Outside, a strong wind was blowing and heavy rain was falling. The raindrops beat against the window, rustling, further increasing the desolation of the room. Sickness oppressed me, leaving me no moment of comfort. All sorts of chaotic thoughts were constantly surging in my mind. I thought of the righteous indignation we felt a few days ago when we heard the news of the Japanese invasion of the Eastern Provinces, the enthusiastic scenes of my companions setting out to spread propaganda in the rain, the solemn attitude of the entire student body undergoing military training... one by one, they flashed through my mind in an instant. "Tap tap," a sudden knock on the door interrupted my thoughts. I gently raised my head, and Ji Yi appeared before my eyes. He was wearing a blanket from his shoulders to his waist, holding a small leather bag in his hand, like a warrior beginning his expedition.</p>
<p>"Has your fever gone down a bit?" he asked me when he saw me.</p>
<p>"The doctor already came this afternoon. He said it's a cold and fever, nothing serious. I feel much better than before now. Where are you going?" I asked him suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Don't you know? We are all setting off to Nanjing tonight to petition the government," he said.</p>
<p>"Petition?" I asked again, seemingly knowing but not knowing, because I had heard this said during the day. "It's raining heavily outside, how will you go?" I added, as if remembering something.</p>
<p>"The rain, we can't worry about that. Even if there are greater obstacles, we still have to do it at this time," Ji Yi looked very determined.</p>
<p>"Then when will you be back?" I asked lazily.</p>
<p>"Return date? ... We are now chanting, 'The wind is howling, the Huangpu River is cold; if our goal is not achieved, we vow not to return.' The return date is probably... uncertain," he said, and gave a faint smile.</p>
<p>"..........................................................................................."</p>
<p>Ji Yi fell silent, and I also fell silent. The two of us quietly stared at each other. Suddenly, two tears flowed from Ji Yi's eyes, shining brightly. My tears also fell.</p>
<p>"I'm leaving, goodbye," Ji Yi's voice trembled.</p>
<p>"Goodbye,"</p>
<p>The door slammed shut, and Ji Yi's back disappeared. My thoughts then shifted to this direction. I thought, with such fervent emotions, they are petitioning for the survival of the motherland, they will surely return with satisfaction. I also vaguely saw countless young people, with tragic hearts and ardent spirits.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a chorus of songs came from afar. It carried majesty and solemnity, and the words could be vaguely distinguished, "...San...Min...Zhu...Yi...Wu...Dang...Suo...Zong..." I forgot that I was a sick person, and quickly sat up, but my head felt as if it was pressed down by a great weight, throbbing violently, throbbing so much that I had to lie down again. But this majestic song, like before, continued to come, moving my heart. No, I must get up. So I endured the pain, put on my clothes, and gradually moved to the window, opened the window. The wind was very strong, and the rain beat mercilessly against my face, making me feel exceptionally cold. The dark sky had no stars. The song could now be heard very clearly, and the movement of footsteps could also be seen in the faint light on the other side of the grass. A neat sound came from the cinder road. I longed to join their ranks and move forward together, but I couldn't. Sickness bound me. Ah, this hateful sickness! Tears unknowingly covered my cheeks. They were gone, my companions were gone, they had left me alone here. Soon the sound of footsteps and the song, gradually faded, blurred, and finally disappeared at the bend in the road.</p>
<p>"Go forward, brave warriors! For your motherland, for your nation, go forward! I wish you success from afar!" I couldn't help but think this way, followed by a deep sigh.</p>
<p>Heavily and unconsciously, I fell back on the bed. The whole room was quiet again, a deathly silence all around, without the slightest sound. Only, only the clock on the table still mechanically made its impatient "tick-tock" sound.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Student Soldiers <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Guanhua</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Row upon row of anti-Japanese movement enthusiasm spread from the north to the south. Row upon row of cries also came from within this enthusiasm, like a quiet autumn wind, already unsettlingly vibrating. This autumn wind, like peace, gradually tended towards fervor, from fervor tended towards excitement, like a wounded wolf howling, like a comfortable tiger cub howling, a sleeping lion howling, howling, moving, and standing up.</p>
<p>The leaves, originally calm, now also seemed to be signaled by the autumn wind and began to shake, shooting out like arrows, reflecting the red sun of the sky.</p>
<p>The student soldiers of X University in West Shanghai also seemed to be triggered by the combative signal of nature and erupted. The initial humming of songs gradually lessened the consciousness of crying. The initial shrinking will gradually moved forward. The initial melancholic spirit gradually heated up. The men went up,</p>
<p>"Courage, Forward, Struggle," we, the student soldiers of X University in West Shanghai, were remembering, remembering like remembering something more important than eating and sleeping. Remembering while strolling, remembering while chatting, remembering while debating, remembering while silent, remembering while melancholic, remembering while angry, remembering while meditating, remembering while praying at night. These six words "Courage, Forward, Struggle," would jump up during decline, vibrate during tiredness, and shout wildly during sadness. These six words "Courage, Forward, Struggle," would writhe and coil like poisonous snakes in the minds of every student soldier.</p>
<p>"Is the shadow of past national humiliation not a black spot on our individual souls? Is it not a black spot on the souls of all our compatriots? Is it not a black spot on our entire nation? This black spot is what we should cut off, take away, use our shining knives to cut it off, use our guns to blast it away, use our fists to shatter it, use the hot blood from everyone's heart to scatter it. This is our responsibility, the responsibility of all the people."</p>
<p>This is what was on the minds of the student soldiers as they pondered and stirred.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The national flag was waving.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the "Assemble" command of the leaders of each squad, every student soldier stood at attention, rising from solemn contemplation.</p>
<p>They were all wearing yellow uniforms, leggings, each holding a gun neatly, looking at the military cap of the comrade standing on the right, staring, standing straight. "Forward march," each squad leader shouted excitedly. Each student soldier followed the front in an orderly manner. They reflected the youthful morning light as they walked forward in the morning's undulation. There was nothing to hear on the parade ground except the sound of "da, da, da" footsteps. This air of solemnity shattered the silence. They raised their heads, looked ahead, and walked step by step, forgetting their boredom, forgetting their melancholy, forgetting their sadness, forgetting their families, only remembering that they were a part of the nation, and that they should take on their responsibilities.</p>
<p>"Attention," each squad leader shouted sternly, and every student soldier stood still, listening to the command.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The national flag was waving.</p>
<p>Each squad leader held a flag of white cloth with black characters, some reading "Petition the National Government in Nanjing," some reading "Rather Die Under the Knife than be a Slave to a Lost Nation," some reading "Struggle," some reading "Rise Up," some reading "Kill All Brutal Japanese," etc. Each flag showed a passionate awareness, a forward-thinking awareness. Those words were written in tears, those words were written in blood.</p>
<p>Each squad leader ordered the squads to count off. Each squad consisted of twenty men, totaling fifty squads. They looked at the words on the flagpoles, looking at the sky, looking at the clouds, looking at the faces of everyone forced out by the surging hot blood, looking at the trembling and angry chests of everyone.</p>
<p>Squad after squad, they headed towards the North Railway Station.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>They set off with orderly steps, treading on dust on the road, singing songs. Their songs were calm, organized. Within their calm, organized songs, the tones were tragic and indignant. That song was the fluctuating cry of everyone's inspiration, suddenly rising, suddenly falling, spinning and leaping in the swaying of the wind. Suddenly they turned coarse and violent, like the tides of a stormy coast. They unknowingly had reached the North Railway Station.</p>
<p>They forgot fatigue, forgot hunger, they felt that the present moment did not allow them to have such emotions, they understood that the present moment only allowed them to muse on their own "mission," this "mission" that could not be delayed.</p>
<p>They had already boarded the train, they sat separately in squads, they did not think that many pedestrians were noisily criticizing them, praising them, they did not think that "life" and "death" were joyful and sad, they thought of those six words "Courage, Forward, Struggle."</p>

<h3 id="e159">Japanese Residents and the Philippine Hill Bin Existence <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Japan, with its small land and overpopulation, has no choice but to develop outwards. In order to solve its overpopulation problem, Japan has so-called "Northern Expansion" and "Southern Expansion" policies. However, European and American countries have already expelled Japanese residents from their territories. The only places where Japan can extend its reach are some parts of Asia. For decades, Japan has been meticulously planning to seize our country's Northeast (Manchuria) and the South Seas islands. Now, Japan has already implemented military action by occupying Shenyang. Newspapers have exposed its ambitions. What I want to discuss here is the Japanese residents' conspiracy to buy the Philippines. 丨丨</p>
<p>According to the Philippine correspondence, the Philippine Free Press published on the 18th of last month contained important documents treasured for fifteen years regarding Japanese residents' plan to purchase the Philippines with 400 million yen. The origin is that in 1916, a group of 61 Japanese celebrities including Dr. Seiichi Kishida traveled to the Philippines and were well received. At that time, Japanese celebrities residing in the Philippines and Japanese celebrities visiting the Philippines gathered to draft a petition to then-Prime Minister Ōkuma, suggesting that the Japanese government use 400 million yen to buy the Philippines from the United States. Unexpectedly, the original manuscript of the petition was obtained by a patriotic youth of the Philippines. That youth was a servant of a certain Japanese residents' organization in the Philippines, so he was able to obtain this original manuscript. After obtaining this original manuscript, he immediately handed it over to the Free Press and sent a copy to Mr. Quezon, the Philippine commissioner to the United States at the time. After obtaining the document, the Free Press kept it secret for a long time. Recently, the issue of Japanese residents in Davao has attracted attention from all parties in the Philippines, so the newspaper published this fifteen-year-old document to make the public aware that the Japanese invasion of the Philippines has been premeditated for a long time, and not a sudden event. Now, the original manuscript of the Japanese residents' petition is translated as follows: (1) The situation in the Far East,</p>
<p>We dare not predict when the European war will end and what the conditions for restoring peace will be in the future (Translator's note: Because the European war was in full swing at that time, hence this statement), but it can be asserted that Germany will lose its influence in the Far East. The balance of power in the Eastern Hemisphere has formed a new trend. Russia, with its long railways, has consolidated itself in the north. Britain, with India and Australia as its bases, is also very secure. These two countries are both allies of our country (Japan's ally, Translator's note: At that time, the Russian Tsarist government had not yet been overthrown). At present, they are not a threat to our country. France is focusing on managing its Indochina (Annam), which is also not a threat to Japan. Only the islands owned by the United States, scattered in the Pacific Ocean, such as Honolulu, the Philippines, and Guam, will undoubtedly lead to conflicts of interest with Japan in the future. If any major power has a dispute with the Japanese Empire, if the Chinese issue is the main cause of the dispute, then Japan's only major enemy should be the United States. Recently, the United States Congress has expressed unfriendly sentiments towards Japan, which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>(2) The China Issue</p>
<p>As for the China issue, the European war has indeed given us the opportunity to develop our interests in China, but it is also enough to make American politicians engage in conspiracies to harm our interests. Moreover, our development in the South Seas easily causes panic among Americans regarding the Philippines. This phenomenon is not surprising, because recently, there have been very serious disputes between Japan and the United States over the issue of the treatment of Japanese residents in the Pacific by the United States. Fortunately, this dispute has not reached the point of rupture, but it has already caused a lot of suspicion and resentment between the two countries. If American politicians oppose Japan's China policy and engage in various conspiracies to undermine it, what other incidents cannot occur between the two countries once the conspiracy expands? Moreover, after the European war ends, no matter how it ends, we firmly believe that Germany will use the United States to encourage China to oppose Japan, because after the war, Germany will have no ability to directly interfere in Far Eastern affairs.</p>
<p>(4) Methods of Maintaining Peace If the true meaning of diplomacy lies in avoiding war, then shouldn't we try our best to find a peaceful way to resolve the dispute between Japan and the United States? The dispute between Japan and the United States is based on the rapid increase in the Japanese population. The Japanese population increases by 600,000 every year (Translator's note: Currently, the Japanese population increases by 1.3 million every year), and there must be a place to settle. The United States has a vast land and a sparse population, and needs Japanese workers. However, American workers have a strong organization and are determined to exclude Japanese workers. Therefore, political organizations are deployed to implement their plans. We know that the central government of the United States does not agree, but the states of the United States have independent powers. The federal government cannot stop what the state governments do. Although our country sympathizes with the US federal government, it still cannot abandon the demand for fair treatment of Japanese residents and equal opportunities. Under such circumstances, it is not easy to resolve. However, there is still a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>(4) The Philippines as the Focus of American Political Strife After the United States occupied the Philippines in 1898, the Philippines became the focus of American political strife. If the United States occupies the Philippines for a long time, it will inevitably go against the American spirit. First-class American politicians such as Wilson have already strongly advocated abandoning the Philippines. At this time, the US government is led by the Democratic Party. President Wilson and other key figures of the Democratic Party, and a small number of key figures of the Republican Party, do not consider colonial policy to be correct, and advocate abandoning their possessions in the Far East. What the United States does not need and is willing to abandon may be the key to resolving the friendship between Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>(5) Suggestions to the Prime Minister</p>
<p>What we want to suggest to the Prime Minister is nothing more than that the Japanese government should consult with the US government to buy the Philippines from the United States at a certain price, repay the loan in installments, and use the dispatch of Japanese labor to the United States as an exchange condition. If this proposal can be realized, all disputes between the two countries will naturally come to an end. The United States can thereby reduce its "burden of the Japanese," and Japan can thereby alleviate its "overpopulation." It is a win-win situation. What is there for both countries not to do?</p>
<p>Leaders in the American political circles can often maintain their fairness and goodwill towards other countries. Although they have recently embarked on the wrong path of expanding their territory, the recent victory of the Democratic Party in the election and the control of the government's power show that the United States has returned to its inherent political track.</p>
<p>(6) Commercial Issues with China The United States has a vast land and abundant resources, and its products must be exported for sale. China is one of its main markets. Looking at the United States in Europe, it does not have an inch of territory, but it can still gain commercial power. It is obvious that the Americans already know that they do not need the Philippines as a base for their trade with China. Japan has long advocated maintaining the integrity of China's territory and is determined to abide by the Open Door Policy in China, so that all countries can enjoy equal opportunities in China. Therefore, the United States' abandonment of the Philippines will not result in the loss of its commercial development on the Asian continent. The United States has always been committed to maintaining peace and humanity. If it insists on occupying its distant possessions, it must arouse suspicion from other countries, and it will be said that it has ulterior motives other than commerce. We dare to say that Americans who understand the truth will never regard occupying the Philippines as a necessary condition for developing Far Eastern commerce. If the United States receives a reasonable reward, it will be willing to abandon the Philippines to reduce its burden. It should be noted that the United States is waiting for a reasonable opportunity and reason to abandon the Philippines.</p>
<p>(7) The Value of the Philippines</p>
<p>If the United States agrees to our plan, then what is the value of the Philippines? This should be carefully calculated by those responsible for the consultation. However, we may as well make an estimate first. According to the war between the United States and Spain, it cost a total of 130 million US dollars. The bonds issued by the United States at that time were 200 million US dollars, with an annual interest rate of 3%. However, the actual money spent during the war did not exceed 130 million US dollars. After the war, the United States signed a treaty and bought the Philippines from Spain for 20 million US dollars. After the Americans occupied the Philippines, they spent another 7 million US dollars to buy the Catholic Church's real estate in the Philippines, 5 million US dollars to build wharves, bridges, and roads, and 4 million US dollars to build the water reservoir in Manila.</p>
<p>In 1910, the US-owned Philippine government sold 123,680 hectares of church land out of 397,000 hectares to the people (approximately one-third). Moreover, the 130 million US dollars in war expenses for the Spanish-American War were not purely for the conquest of the Philippines. After the Spanish-American War, the United States obtained not only the Philippines but also Puerto Rico and Cuba as protectorates. It is estimated that the Philippines currently has 493 miles of railways. If Japan buys from the United States, the value is no more than 70 million US dollars. Excluding the cost of the British railways, the total price for Japan to buy the Philippines from the United States should not exceed 400 million yen. A cheaper price may be obtained during formal consultations in the future.</p>
<p>(8) The Benefits to Japan</p>
<p>If Japan acquires the Philippines, its benefits will be no less than those to the United States. The Philippines is only 62 miles away from Taiwan, so Japan has a necessary to purchase it. Moreover, the Caroline Islands in the South Seas have recently fallen into Japanese hands. The current situation makes it necessary for Japan to advance in two directions. Our governance of Taiwan has won the praise and admiration of the world. If we obtain the Philippines, we will also be able to govern the Philippines in the same way as we govern Taiwan. Administrative efficiency, the revitalization of industry, the treatment of the natives, and the provision of sanitation will all be the same as in Taiwan. Once the Philippines is obtained by Japan, the coast of the Asian continent will have a connected chain of Japanese islands as a barrier, from the Ryukyu Islands in the north to the Caroline Islands in the south. Then the territory of China can be complete, and the permanent peace of East Asia can be realized. If we can encourage Americans' love of justice and peace, we will be able to obtain American sympathy, because once Japan and the United States break apart, the magnitude of the disaster is difficult to describe. Although we now possess the Caroline Islands in the South Seas, a war with the United States is certainly not difficult, but why spend a huge sum of 300 to 400 million yen to occupy the Philippines more easily? What is gained is land, and what is spent is only money. If Japan can buy the Philippines from the United States through peaceful means, both the United States and Japan will benefit. Isn't it better than war?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Japanese residents seem to think that by spending only 300 to 400 million yen, they can buy the Philippines from the United States. If that were possible, why would the United States have gone to war with Spain and occupied the Philippines? After the military victory, why would it have spent such a large sum of money to buy the Philippines from Spain and build it? The United States, as a kingdom of money, is probably contemptuous of Japan's shabby 300 to 400 million yen.</p>
<p>The most absurd thing Japanese residents say is that "Japan has long advocated the integrity of its territory and is determined to abide by the Open Door Policy in China, so that all countries can enjoy equal opportunities in China," and "Then the territory of China can be complete, and the permanent peace of East Asia can be realized." 丨丨 Today, it is not Britain, France, or the United States, nor is it Russia, that has occupied Shenyang, but Japan, which claims to advocate the integrity of China's territory. It is not another country that is destroying the permanent peace of East Asia, but Japan, which constantly claims to maintain the permanent peace of East Asia. Get out! Our China has not yet become a colony. We want our nation to stand up on its own. We want to seal your mouths, you Japanese and Americans, who shout the slogans of "Open Door Policy, Equal Opportunities."</p>
<p>Finally, Japan, Japan, is capable of seizing the land of others. After all, if World War II breaks out, its small gambling capital of land will probably be bet on its ambition to seize the land of others. French General Foch</p>
