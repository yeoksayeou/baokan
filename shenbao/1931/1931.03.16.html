<p>世界和平之破壞非僅一端則所以挽救之者亦非一問題所能盡且此一問題之成功亦須循序漸進第一步成功而後尙須加以第二第三步之努力始能得到最後之成功軍縮會議即使全部告成亦僅爲除去和和平障碍之一端何也軍縮而外尙有外交政治經濟上種種糾紛皆足以阻止和平之進行者也况今日意法問意見之消除其成功亦祗及於完成五國海軍協定將來進而議陸軍議航空議其他關於軍備之一切問題能否順利進行以達於軍縮最後成功之境固未能逆料之也</p>
<p>軍縮而外關於經濟上之合作亦甚重要各國早己努力之矣歐洲之關税休戰會議爲歐洲謀經濟合作之始點據今日柏林電德國會己將去春日内瓦關税休戰會議所訂之公約通過商約效力延長一年即在此一年内各不加税固亦經濟合作上一有希望之消息也然商約延長而後一方面須即進而謀如集第三届之國際經濟會議討論實施公約方法與談判關税休戰程序之議定書等手續正多是否事事順利尙未能知即使關税休戰完全成功然其他關於經濟上須謀切實合作之問題亦非少數故欲達到經濟合作最後之成功更非易易吾故曰關税公約通過於各國亦僅初步有希望之消息而己</p>

<p>— 默之</p>
<p>第三十一期大光書局發行</p>
<p>前鋒周報是民族主義文藝運動中的主力刋物而且它底出版時期爲最先倘若以史底眼光來逮民族文藝運動的主潮那麽這内容充實的偉大的前鋒周報我們却不能不愼重地論及它己出版至三十一期但是每一期都在改進之中使民族主義的文藝作品因之漸漸地健全起來成爲現代最有力的一種文藝作品這裏面的論著小説詩歌以及隨筆等文字没有一篇不是值得我們再三閲讀的這最近出版的一期内容是更形充實計有湯冰若的「民族主義的小品文」嚴肅的「某一天」若藢的「誓不歸」蕭葭的談鋒「偶爾想到」争波譯的「兩個孤兒」續稿等　　　　民族主義的小品文我們雖未能一窺全豹但是讀了第一節民族主義小品文的意義却可以使我們明白這項小品文的本質了例如作者所論</p>
<p>民族主義的小品文它底産生並不像通常所見的那樣單純在寒冽的冬天圍坐在暖爐旁邊的安樂椅上倘是酷熱的夏天則披浴衣啜香茗隨隨便便地和好友們任心閒譚將這所述照様地移動在報紙上的東西這當然也可以説是小品文其它在堂堂皇皇的異國情調的洋屋裏擁抱着歌妓的時候鷙熱情之所至隨意塗寫一些咀哭現社會的所謂「大衆化」的短文這可以説是小品文不過它是屬於口號標語而没有眞的生命的一類底作品至於民族主義的小品文它是含有警句和感慣性（pothos）的在一篇具有中心意識向上的短文中可以促起昏瞶青年底覺醒可以鼓湧富有革命性的衝開烽火連天的最前線爲整個的民族盛衰而奮鬭可以引起瞥見强暴的帝國主義對於我國侵略的憤慨所以它底題目天下國家的大事固不待言還有市井的瑣事書籍的批評相識者的消息野景的感觸戰塲上的情景先烈的遺蹟醜惡的糾正以及自己的過去的值得追懷的種種祗要是富有民族主義中心思想的這一類的文章屬於民族主義的向上的前進的有力的作品</p>
<p>作者這樣簡明的叙述旣然可以使我們明瞭民族主義的小品文究竟是什麽的一個大概同時也指示了我們關於此項小品文應如何的取材第一節爲民族主義小品文的價值所論各點更爲明激而有獨到之處因全文未完故在此暫不加以詳論但是我們在本文的開始所使我們得到的影象就如此的完美與深切足見本文所論的精審了</p>
<p>「某一天」是一篇書信體的短篇創作寫一個被帝國主義壓迫的安南人在異地圖謀民族革命的情緒表現是如何的動人而有力我們被壓迫的民族者讀了這文之後不但使之同情於弱小民族所受的苦離以及遭遇的不幸同時所以引起爲整個的弱小民族的决心這就是本文具有民族主義文藝中心點其偉大價值所在舉如</p>
<p>…雖然我們是失敗我們的精神上依然不會現在頽喪這至少也呌法帝國主義者的寒心了</p>
<p>我現在己經是囚徒了倪牢獄本是革命者的家鄉我在這兒感到無上的光榮我嘗試革命者所慣常的滋味</p>
<p>前天就是我們的所預定的日子在夜間十一時我們舉起安南獨立的高旗大隊的人唱革命歌向統治我們大本營猛烈的攻擊我們本來祗有幾百人後來民衆臨時參加者有千餘人混戰了通　終因爲我們缺乏械彈而失敗</p>
<p>那位可敬愛的女同志竟首先在槍林彈雨中被敵人殺死因爲她壯烈的影響大家更奮力前進繼續犧牲者有百餘人到昨天正午以前殺死的打傷的被捕的都先後分别判定我們各人的命運但是很少逃亡的</p>
<p>我因爲右腿被擊倒在地下昨天活像抬猪樣的抬到這裏來這裏己經有很多同志了窄小的屋子裏擠满許多人空氣恶濁之至屋外有步哨巡察不准囚犯偶語</p>
<p>聽説明天就開始審判了我們自然是準備了判决死刑的</p>
<p>賄賂了一個看守這封信才能送出……（第三封信）</p>
<p>這種奮勇的爲弱小民族革命的毅力與精神委實值得我們底敬佩當然是能夠鼓湧讀者向前犧牲的因爲書信體的創作易於表現它旣然具有眞的情緒在文詞上又可以隨意書寫一點也不須要美麗的詞藻來點綴所以它底本身就是易於感動讀者的一種文學作品的體式我們讀了毋須説内在的心靈是被它深深地感動的了而且這又是具有民族主義中心思想的文字更其值得我們的注意使我們走向正確的爲弱小民族奮鬥的道路</p>
<p>「誓不歸」一詩却是一首力作實際民族主義的詩歌每一首都充满着熱與力旣雄放又激昂值得我們再三歌詠的在藝術技巧上也超過所謂口號標語一類的詩許多在這誓不歸一詩裏即可窺見它所具備的藝術上的條件了</p>
<p>從今日起我們誓不歸</p>
<p>揚着鞭向逃竄的敵人猛追</p>
<p>雖然是戰馬在力竭聲嘶</p>
<p>雖然是兄弟們匍伏在夕陽衰草裏</p>
<p>追到他最後的陣地</p>
<p>在那裏救起我們受宰割的兄弟</p>
<p>我們是爲自由而戰</p>
<p>我們是爲兄弟們殺敵</p>
<p>作者這樣表現是如何圓熟而有力總之我們在不很大的一張前鋒周報上能夠到這樣充實的偉大的文字實屬可喜以後我相信在這裏更有精深而有力的文字呈顯於我們的讀者之前的</p>
<h3 id="c162">草野創作專號 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>

<p>第十十一期合刋</p>
<p>中國的純文藝刋物在目前的狀態之中不是消沉就是没落以抱着發揚文化努力創造新文藝爲主旨的在現今却是少見尤其以純正的態度灌輸讀者正確思想的在中國純文藝的定期刋物中我們不得不推這己有相當歷史的「草野」週刋了</p>
<p>誰也在説草野是荒蕪的中國文藝園中後起的一朶奇花是一般努力耕耘的青年園了們心血灌溉的結晶所以這裏面的文字大都是富有向上的青年性有如春夜一樣的鮮麗流水一樣的豪放山峯一樣的雄偉這等作品眞的在别的所謂大的刋物上是很難見到的同時它又具有正確的思想指示一條文學上應走的進路因爲在不久之前中國的思想界實在太混亂了所擺在青年們眼前的出版物其内容不是浪漫的就是古典的不是頽廢派的就是普羅的尤其是這最後一種所謂普羅文學不知灌輸多少有爲的青年走上畸形的道路這種播揚不正確思想的文學讀物雖然是盛興實際上是促使中國新文學的没落如果要挽救這中國文壇唯一的危機祗有希望最近的國内出版界多産生具有正確意議的文學作品那麽這革野週刋作者以爲就是現代一般青年所需要的讀物之一種况且它底内容每次有新底改進無論詩歌小説隨筆等文字都是值得我們一讀的這次它所出版的創作專號其選載的作品每一篇都有其偉大的特性可以代表各個作者特具的風格其文字的精美當然毋須叙述但是有一二篇的體裁却别創一種新的格例爲中國的創作界所僅見的作品</p>
<p>這期的内容除文壇新訊之外計包括大篇創作湯增敭的一韓國少女的日記」鄒枋的「紫羅蘭色的描寫」黄奐若的「惡運的戰敗」白雪的「夢裏的笑」張維的「重逢後的心影」王鐵華的「期待着你」等在篇的數量上雖然不多但是每</p>
<p>一篇都有一種新的格調值得我們的一讀</p>
<p>湯增敭的「韓國少女的日記」是一篇富有革命性的文學作品是以一個韓國的爲她所屬民族奮鬥作事實的中心雖然是採用日記的體式但其所寫的並不流俗却别具一種新的格調的描寫女子的心理處尤見作者藝術手腕的獨到現在我節錄這少女日記比較短些的一日記事使讀者有以明瞭其文學是如何的流利情感是如何的豐富同時是充满着向上的意識的舉如</p>
<p>三日</p>
<p>睡在床上老是懶得起來因爲今朝十時有課所以時計在九時半的光景祗得鼓起女青年們應有的革命精神跳下了床梳洗畢剛敲上課鐘我就隨了紅的綠的那般年輕的女同學們去上課這課的敎授是范先生他講的政治學眞是娓娓動聽每一句言辭都是同情於弱小民族的革命的有許多獨到的正確的見解很可以給我們韓國革命借鏡所以我就把它很詳細的記在筆記簿上了午後無事翻譯了一篇美國名家的小説自己覺得很满意預備在一個雜誌上發表我的日文雖然比英文程度來的高但是這壓迫弱小民族的日帝國主義者的作品我無論如何是不願意翻譯不管他們所寫的是同情韓國的復興或是鼓勵他們壓迫韓國的</p>
<p>我覺得韓國的與盛祗希望我們一般女革命者在中國能夠努力發展和中國等等所謂弱小民族聯合起來因爲韓國己是亡了國的國家如果靠自己的力量從日帝國主義者重壓之下復興起來擺脱了他們的桎梏這實在不是一件容易的事所以我們聯合弱小民族站在同一戰線上奮鬥或許見到一線的希望那偉大的韓國旗幟在我們頭上高標的時候我預祝着</p>
<p>這種易於一般人閲讀所謂「平民化」的文字在目前實爲最需要它底産生但它己具有藝術上的美的價值了</p>
<p>鄒枋的「紫羅蘭色的描寫」是别具有一種新的創格其文字的細　宛如給我們歌詠一首美的散文詩同時又具有向上的意識這樣的刻畫非具有高超的藝術手腕不可它描寫二個青年徘徊於神秘的街最後是取得覺醒的意識仍保留着青年人最寶貴的春這是多麽有意義的含意實爲很難見到的文藝作品　　　　「惡運的戰敗「我們望名可以思義是一篇具有向上性的革命作品黄奐若所寫的創作在本刋上我們讀到很多但在我認爲這是一篇更满意的佳構他描寫一個生了男孩的女子和一切惡勢力的奮鬭結果當然是可以得到勝利愈寫到最後向上的精神更有充分的表現如他所説「但是縱使命運的擺佈使我們跳入了茫茫的人海然而憑藉了我們自己力量去和環境奮鬭定能把惡魔似的命運戰敗那是我們的凱旋之歌可以高奏我們各自的環境是光明的幸福的最後洵芬這種勝利的獲得應該我們自己去努力不要企圖别人的援助并且愈我們更要認清我們的努力方向不要激於一時的感憤而跑上错誤的道途」這是多麽懇切而有意義的話是一般青年都應該廳的吧</p>
<p>「期待着你」是王鐵華的一篇長篇續稿雖然仍是未曾刋完但是使我們二讀愈覺得其所特具的精采當然結構的緊凑也是創作中唯一的重要王君的期待着你讀了它底人總可以明白它不僅是結構上得到了有力的成功是一篇有藝術價值的作品我們在小小的一張草野上能讀到這樣圓熟的長篇佳構實屬意外的可喜</p>
<p>其它兩篇當然也值得一讀的可惜是張維的那篇「重逢後的心影」未能一窺全豹爲快不過這創作專號裏的文字能得到這樣的成績在小小的一張草野週刋上和我們相見我始終覺得是值得意外讚美的</p>
<p>最後「編者講話」裏曾預告著即將出版的詩歌專號和批評專號我想一定更有美满的收獲因爲這裏面的作著詩人爲最多但這裏所謂詩人當然是具有修養工夫的我們等待着讀它那更偉大的作品吧</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e19">German Parliament Passes Tax Truce Convention <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The destruction of world peace does not arise from just one factor, and therefore, the measures to save it cannot be exhausted by addressing just one issue. Moreover, the success of this one issue must proceed sequentially, requiring continued efforts in the second and third steps after the first step's success to achieve the final success. Even if the Disarmament Conference is entirely successful, it only removes one obstacle to peace. Why? Because beyond disarmament, there are still various diplomatic, political, and economic disputes that are sufficient to hinder the progress of peace. Furthermore, even with the resolution of Franco-Italian differences today, its success only extends to completing the Five-Power Naval Agreement. Whether future discussions on land forces, air forces, and other matters related to armaments can proceed smoothly to achieve the final success of disarmament is indeed unpredictable.</p>
<p>Beyond disarmament, economic cooperation is also very important, and various countries have already been working on it. The European Tax Truce Conference is the starting point for seeking economic cooperation in Europe. According to today's Berlin dispatch, the German Parliament has passed the convention established at the Geneva Tax Truce Conference last spring, extending the validity of commercial agreements by one year, during which taxes will not be increased. This is indeed a hopeful sign for economic cooperation. However, after extending the commercial agreements, on the one hand, steps must be taken to convene the Third International Economic Conference to discuss the implementation of the convention and the protocol for negotiating tax truce procedures. Whether everything goes smoothly is still unknown. Even if the tax truce is completely successful, there are still numerous other issues related to economic affairs that require substantial cooperation, making it far from easy to achieve the final success of economic cooperation. Therefore, I say that the passage of the tax truce convention is only a preliminary hopeful sign for various countries.</p>

<p>Hong Kong: Thirty-six employees of the Norwegian ship Rose Village arrived here today on the Henry Kiswick tugboat of the Kowloon Dock. It is said that after the ship ran aground, they saw a tree 50 yards away and tried to throw a rope to lasso the tree trunk. Before long, the ship was about to rupture, so the people on the ship took food and other items and climbed onto the tree trunk to camp for a week awaiting rescue. A large group of fishermen repeatedly tried to board the ship with the intention of robbery, but the crew members opened fire to scare them away. They then guarded the ship day and night in shifts. Although the fishermen repeatedly committed crimes, they could not succeed. When the Henry Kiswick arrived, they saw that the ship could not be salvaged, so they left the island on Friday and came to Hong Kong. As for the rumor that the ship was occupied by pirates, it may be that the fishermen finally boarded the ship and robbed it after they left the island. According to reports, the Rose Village was not completed long ago and has a load capacity of 9,000 tons. This time, it carried 3,000 tons of cargo, mostly flour and timber. The ship operates on the route between Seattle and the East and only sails to Singapore. This was the second time it had sailed. (Fifteenth Dispatch, Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Speech on Diplomatic Policy <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Recognizing disarmament as the only guarantee of political security and hoping that European nations will break down the divides and cooperate sincerely. The Franco-Italian naval agreement should not restrict land and air armaments. Rome, 14th (National News Agency). Today, when the Italian Parliament discussed foreign affairs, Foreign Minister Grandi gave a speech elaborating on the fundamental principles guiding diplomatic policy. First, he recognized disarmament as the only possible solution to the issue of political security. Second, he said that economic cooperation among European nations is the only effective tool to break through economic difficulties. Third, he sought to unite European nations, sharing each other's joys and sorrows. Only with these three goals, and if each nation is completely equal, can any of them be achieved. Therefore, Italian diplomatic policy aims to reduce the divide between the victorious and defeated nations, regardless of their government systems, and strives to sincerely cooperate with each other. Finally, he said that all discussions at the future international disarmament conference must be based on equality. Referring to the Franco-Italian naval agreement, Grandi said that the agreement only affects naval armaments and does not hinder land and air armaments, but it is sufficient to indicate the path to limiting armaments and proves that progress in this direction can yield concrete results, so it has extraordinary value.</p>

<p>Only Six Important Bills Passed, Hamaguchi's Health Seems Stable.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th Dispatch from Japan United News Agency: The Seiyukai Party held an emergency meeting of its executive committee last night and decided to submit a motion of no confidence in the cabinet. The motion lists flaws in fiscal and economic policies, failures in diplomacy with China, the Musha Incident, national defense issues, and the acting prime minister issue, etc., and intends to thoroughly censure the government through questioning and discussion. The proposed timing for the motion is around the 17th or 19th, and party president Inukai or Tokonami will explain the reasons.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency: Only ten days remain in this parliamentary session. Although the ordinary budget has been safely passed, none of the important bills that the government declared it would implement at the time of its cabinet formation have been passed. As of the 15th, the government has proposed a total of 73 important bills, of which only six have been passed, and as many as 52 are stalled in the House of Peers. This is due to the fact that although the Minseito Party holds an absolute majority, it lacks unity and fighting spirit, and is merely preoccupied with maintaining power without the enthusiasm to implement policies.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency: Judging from Hamaguchi's clear and forceful responses to figures like Oguchi in the Lower House yesterday, his health is almost the same as usual. Therefore, those who doubted him, centered around the party president, are gradually relieved and determined to thoroughly support the Prime Minister through the parliamentary session and ask Saionji to understand.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e65">National Government Grants Preferential Treatment to Yang Du-sheng's Family <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The National Government instructed the Executive Yuan: Based on the submission from Wu Jingheng and others, it is a request for special compensation to Comrade Yang Du-sheng. Comrade Yang Du-sheng, whose given name was Shouren, was from Changsha, Hunan. During the late Qing Dynasty, he once studied for the imperial examinations and obtained the title of "Bazi Juren." Later, due to the spread of the revolutionary cause of Generalissimo Sun Yat-sen throughout the country, Comrade Yang, in Hunan, along with Huang Xing, Liu Kuiyi, Chen Tianhua, Song Jiaoren, and other comrades, suddenly became aware and initiated the "Huaxing Society." Most of the students from Hunan joined, and comrades from other provinces, such as Comrade Zhang Ji, were invited to serve as teachers at the Mingde School. Everyone in Hunan, together with Comrade Ma Fuyi, secretly plotted an uprising, and sent Comrade Yang to Shanghai to coordinate everything. Later, Comrade Ma was defeated and killed. Comrade Yang then went to Japan with Huang and Song to participate in the Tongmenghui. He also invited Su Manshu and Xu Zihong to rent a house in Yokohama to manufacture bombs. Due to carelessness in mixing the medicine, Comrade Yang blew off two fingers. This was noticed by the Japanese police, and they all fled. Afterwards, he traveled between Tokyo and Shanghai, and published opinions in newspapers under a pseudonym, criticizing the Manchus. This was noticed by Qing officials. There was a supervisor of students in Europe named Kuai Guangdian, a Qing official who secretly protected party members, and he took Comrade Yang to England. While in England, Comrade Yang was indignant about current affairs and often harbored thoughts of ending his life. On the one hand, he continued his research on bombs, wanting to create sophisticated weapons and sneak into Beijing to plot a major assassination and perish together with important figures of the Qing Dynasty. He discussed the methods of making medicine with comrades studying in England at the time, and exchanged letters constantly (Jingheng still has three very long letters). Then, he heard that on March 29th of the Xinhai year, Huang Xing led an attack on the governor's office in Guangzhou, which nearly succeeded but ultimately failed, and seventy-two people died. Half of them were the most outstanding comrades of our party, and they were all old friends of Comrade Yang. Thereupon, he spent his days aimlessly writing in the air, lamenting repeatedly. On June 11th of that year, he walked from Scotland to Liverpool and drowned himself in the sea. He was only forty years old. Before his death, he entrusted Comrade Shi Ying with the thousand yuan (a full one hundred pounds) he had saved for travel expenses, asking him to remit it to Generalissimo Sun Yat-sen. He also sent a letter to Jingheng, discussing the final preparation of the medicine. His remains were recovered by British officials, and Chinese compatriots throughout England competed to raise money and handle his funeral, erecting a tomb for him in Liverpool's Anfield Park. The Westerners also sighed in admiration. At that time, Sun Yat-sen was in America and was shocked to hear of it. Huang Xing was hiding in Hong Kong and wanted to plan something again, but needed 5,000 yuan, which was difficult to raise. Fortunately, the thousand yuan remitted by Comrade Yang was enough to make up 3,000 yuan. Comrade Yang's selflessness for the party, his death, and his disregard for his own interests were truly difficult for ordinary people to achieve. Comrade Yang's family was full of extraordinary people, all of whom were able to sacrifice themselves for the party and the country, and had no thoughts of personal family. His elder brother, De Lin, whose style name was Xing Sheng, served as the Director of Finance of Hunan during the second year of the Republic. When the Second Revolution of Jiangxi and Nanjing broke out, De Lin supported Hunan's independence and responded to the campaign against Yuan Shikai, and was killed by Tang Xiangming. De Lin's son, Ke Qin, was recently a battalion commander in Jiangxi and died in battle while suppressing the communists. The entire family was loyal and righteous and deserved to be rewarded. However, Comrade Yang's son, Ke Nian, after graduating from Harvard University with a degree in medicine, returned to China and served as the Director of Academic Affairs at Xiangya Medical College. His character and scholarship were praised by his peers, and his ideals were the same as his father's. His entire family relied heavily on his income. However, he absolutely refused to request government assistance because of his father's dedication to the party and the country. Unexpectedly, Ke Nian died suddenly of abdominal pain in December of the nineteenth year, leaving behind an elderly mother, a widow, and a young daughter with no means of survival. Comrade Yang had a younger brother, Lin, who had long suffered from mental illness due to his grief and anger over national affairs and had several children who needed to be educated. This had been borne by Comrade Yang's son, Ke Nian, but now there was nothing. The Yang family sacrificed themselves for the country, and now the entire family is facing starvation. Therefore, Jingheng and others, in memory of Comrade Yang's destruction of his family to sacrifice for the party and the country, believe that the party and the country should compensate his descendants. They propose to provide for his widowed relatives, the weak, and the disabled, so that they can be safe and wait for the children to grow up before they can support themselves. Therefore, they follow the examples of Comrades Xia Chongmin and Zhou Yingshi and request special compensation. They earnestly request the government to examine and approve a monthly allowance of 200 yuan to compensate Comrade Yang Du-sheng's family so that they can be secure for many years. We eagerly await your instructions, etc. Based on this, Martyr Yang Shouren's family is truly commendable and deserving of respect. The aforementioned situation should be approved and handled. In addition to separate orders, we order the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to allocate 200 yuan per month to the Civil Affairs Office of this government for collection and disbursement. This order is given.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Tianjin-Pukou Railway Vehicle Issues <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yanjiong Discusses the Northern Negotiations</p>
<p>Chen Yanjiong, Chairman of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Committee, along with Committee member Sun Mou and Chief of the Mechanical Department Yang Yi, went to Shenyang and Dalian to negotiate vehicle issues with the Northeast and South Manchuria Railway. The matter has now been completed and they returned to Pukou on the 13th. I recently met with Mr. Chen, who said, "The main task of my trip north was the vehicle issue, but the most important thing was to seek close cooperation in transportation with the various railways in the Northeast. When passing through Beining, I met with Director Gao Jiyi and had frank discussions with him. We reached a very consistent spirit and will cooperate with each other in the future to develop the Beining and Tianjin-Pukou Railways. We have also agreed that Beining will allocate two passenger trains to add a Jingping-Liaotong train once a day. The method has been agreed upon and can be implemented. During my two visits to Shenyang to meet with Vice Commander Zhang Xueliang, I was treated with great hospitality and the negotiations were very successful. Zhang has ordered the return of all the vehicles held in the Northeast. After staying in Shenyang for three days, I went to Dalian to negotiate the purchase of vehicles, etc. The most lacking vehicles on our railway are locomotives. The current passenger locomotives are old and slow. To facilitate north-south transportation, we plan to purchase eight Pacific-style locomotives from the South Manchuria Railway at the same price as those purchased by the Jiaoji Railway. However, because the locomotive styles and specifications of our railway are different, the price has increased. After repeated negotiations, they refused to reduce the price, so the agreement was not reached. We then negotiated about renting vehicles. Commercial goods are stockpiled along the railway, urgently needing to be transported, but there are not enough locomotives. Newly purchasing them is beyond our ability and it would take half a year for delivery, which is too slow to solve the urgent need. However, all railways lack locomotives, and even the Northeast only has enough for their own use and has no vehicles to rent. Therefore, we plan to rent from the South Manchuria Railway in the same way as the Sipingjie-Taonan Railway. However, the South Manchuria Railway has joint transportation and loan relations with the Sipingjie-Taonan Railway, and the situation with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is different, so the rental price cannot be compared with the Sipingjie-Taonan Railway. The agreement has not yet been finalized. We then negotiated about repairing vehicles. After our railway recovered various locomotives, they were damaged. It is estimated that there are more than 70 vehicles waiting to be repaired. Even if our railway factory makes every effort to repair them, it can only repair half of them within these five months, and that requires readily available materials and no delays. It is really impossible to repair the remaining half in time to meet the urgent need. We negotiated with Beining and Jiaoji, but neither of them had the capacity to handle it for us. Therefore, we negotiated with the South Manchuria Railway. The railway has sent several technicians to inspect the damage to each vehicle and then negotiate a detailed plan. I left Dalian on the 7th and returned south via Beining. I visited Commander Yu, Chairman Han, and Commander Wang, etc., to discuss defense. There were some bandits near Lincheng, but Commander Wang has sent troops to suppress them and has agreed to do his best to maintain and guarantee the security of our railway, so the line is now very peaceful."</p>
<h3 id="e67">Jinan Girls' Middle School Student <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yuxi Hit by Military Vehicle</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: On the 12th of this month, the sixth anniversary of Generalissimo Sun Yat-sen's death was commemorated in Jinan City Hall. More than 200 students from the Provincial First Girls' Middle School lined up to participate. Unexpectedly, when they reached the Jinpu Hotel on Weiyi Road, a No. 6 military vehicle suddenly hit Chen Yuxi, a student in the second semester of the first grade of the school, and ran over her lower leg. The occupants of the vehicle looked out and saw that an accident had occurred, and then sped off towards the Jinpu Station. Some of the school's students continued to the city hall to attend the meeting, while others, along with teachers, rescued Chen and sent her to the Hehe Pharmacy in the city for emergency treatment. At the same time, they sent someone to follow the vehicle to the Jinpu Railway Station and found that the vehicle was still parked outside the station. The owner of the vehicle was on the platform seeing Han Fuqu off to Dezhou. The original tires on the vehicle had the words "Dechang Foreign Firm 1930," but they had now been removed. Therefore, although the school people still recognized it, they could not catch it at the time and there was nothing they could do. After the memorial meeting ended, the school's students were angry and wanted to go to the Provincial Government to petition, but Principal Su Jizhou strongly advised them to stop. The school has now reported the accident to the Education Department and requested that it be forwarded to the Provincial Government for investigation. At the same time, it sent representatives with a letter to the Provincial Rectification Committee to request assistance. The Provincial Rectification Committee agreed to help. The school also sent a letter to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to investigate the vehicle in detail. According to the Public Security Bureau's reply, the vehicle has been found, but the license plate has been changed. Chen Yuxi, the injured party, is the daughter of salt merchant Chen Boyan. She is sixteen years old. Last night, she was in great pain. The most seriously injured was her left foot, and her right leg was also injured. She had a headache. She will go to Jinan Hospital tomorrow for an X-ray. The injured area has now been set with plaster. The school specially invited the press today to report everything. It is said that the various schools in Jinan will rise up to help and demand that the Provincial Government investigate the matter. The school's letter to the Education Department is recorded below: "Our school, at 8:50 a.m. on March 12th, lined up to go to the City Hall to participate in the memorial meeting for the sixth anniversary of Generalissimo Sun Yat-sen's death. When we reached the vicinity of the Jinpu Railway Hotel on Weiyi Road in the commercial port, a gray vehicle traveling north from the south suddenly sped into the line from behind the students and hit student Chen Yuxi, then ran over the student's foot and sped off. At that time, it was immediately recognized that the vehicle's license plate number was Jinan Military No. 6. There were twelve soldiers in gray uniforms standing outside the vehicle. After the student was run over, she immediately fainted. We immediately sent people to escort her to the Hehe Pharmacy for diagnosis. According to the doctor's examination results, the bone has been broken and she may become disabled, etc. We think that participating in the meeting is a legitimate act, and the students are all lined up and the order is very orderly. If the vehicle had paid a little attention, this unfortunate incident would not have occurred. But after the accident, it sped off without any regard. It is like this, despising human rights and treating human life as a child's play. If we do not strictly investigate and punish it, how can we maintain human rights and warn against lawlessness? In addition to sending a letter to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to investigate and handle the case according to law, we are writing this letter to your office and requesting that your office forward it to the Provincial Government for a thorough investigation and handling of the case. This would be a public service." (March 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Severe Disaster in Gansu <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Deaths Exceed 2 Million, 5 Million+ Victims</p>
<p>Gansu is located in the remote western frontier, and transportation is blocked. It has suffered a great catastrophe for five years. Because the people have long been suppressed under the powerful authority of the Feng Clique, and communication is restricted, there is no way to appeal. Furthermore, disaster investigation and relief personnel are hesitant to move forward due to dangerous roads. As a result, very few people know the truth about the Gansu disaster. According to Mr. Yi Zuorong, the representative of the Gansu Provincial Relief Committee, the disaster situation in the province is extremely serious. The general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Drought: In 1927, the autumn harvest in Gansu was poor. In the summer and autumn of 1928, there was no harvest at all. In 1929, the average harvest was less than 20%, and most farmers were unable to plant seeds, and the harvest was limited due to damage from wind, frost, hail, and insects. Statistics show that more than one million people starved to death in more than 60 disaster-stricken counties, including Dingxi, Tongwei, Yuzhong, Gangu, Huining, Gaolan, Jingyuan, Tao Sand, Longxi, Jingning, Longde, and Wushan. Yongdeng, Hongshui Gu, Lintao, Weiyuan, Daohe, Guyuan, Haiyuan, Heshui, Zhenyuan, Ningxian, Zhenning, and Qin'an are slightly less severe. People could not find food and even resorted to cannibalism. The misery cannot bear to be described.</p>
<p>(2) Military Disaster: Since the Feng Clique entered Gansu five years ago, they have ordered the counties to conscript nearly 200,000 soldiers. Most of them were bought by the people by paying for them, at a price of 200 yuan per person, amounting to more than 30 million yuan. Furthermore, due to the lack of military expenses, the people were ordered to plant opium, collect land taxes, and sell膏 (a type of ointment), amounting to about 10 million yuan per year. Military vehicles and horses were forcibly requisitioned from the counties without any payment. Furthermore, due to endless requisitions, the cattle, horses, and vehicles of the people were completely lost. The ad hoc committees, runners, and officials were constantly on the road. The people could not bear the burden, so they sold their wives and children, or fled with their families, or even committed suicide. Therefore, in the event of a natural disaster, they had no ability to save themselves.</p>
<p>(3) Bandit Disaster: After the Feng Clique entered Gansu, they eliminated dissidents, leading to disturbances. In 1926, the counties in eastern and southern Gansu all experienced war and banditry, which then spread throughout the province. Since 1928, disasters have occurred from Xunhua and Daohe, gradually spreading throughout the province. The counties that were captured include Ningding, Wuwei, Gulang, Yongchang, Shandan, Zhenfan, Lintan, Minxian, Wushan, Longxi, Tianshui, Qin'an, Tongwei, Dingxi, Huining, Longde, Jingchuan, Haiyuan, Jingning, Ningxia, Ningshuo, Ningxian, Xiahe, Wudu, Lixian, Zhuanglang, Huangyuan, Guide, and Xunhua. Among them, Huangyuan, Lixian, and Zhenfan suffered the most severely, with the entire city being massacred. In Wuwei, Tianshui, Ningding, Lintan, Wushan, Tongwei, and Wudu, two to three thousand or three to four thousand people were massacred in each city. Although the cities of Lintao and Daohe were not captured, about 100,000 people were massacred in the villages around them. No less than tens of thousands of people were killed in scattered villages and towns. Statistics show that in the past three years, at least 200,000 people have died directly at the hands of bandits throughout the province. The burning of houses, looting of property, and abduction of women have occurred in almost every county.</p>
<p>Since the major earthquake in Gansu in 1920, the wounds have not yet healed. In 1927, the area belonging to Liangzhou suffered another earthquake, killing 40,000 to 50,000 people. In recent years, the drought has been too severe, and there have been various other disasters, such as mountain floods in Lixian and Yuzhong counties, hail in Zhangxian, Dingxi, and Lintao counties, windstorms in Wushan and Gangu counties, black frost in Jingyuan and Gaolan counties, and strange five-colored mice in Yongdeng, Yongjing, Longxi, and Dingxi, destroying crops and causing great harm. Furthermore, after the military disasters, there was a major epidemic, mostly infectious diseases such as throat sores, dysentery, and scarlet fever. The number of deaths reached 500,000 to 600,000 people. Combining the above disasters, the total number of deaths is more than two million, and the property losses are incalculable. This is a great catastrophe that Gansu has never experienced. Since the relief efforts began, the total amount of relief funds received in the past three years has been only a little over one million, which is distributed to more than 60 counties and 4 to 5 million disaster victims. On average, each person receives no more than 2 jiao. When grain prices are extremely high, this cannot even buy a day's worth of food. How can it provide relief? Furthermore, the banditry has not subsided, the people are displaced, the villages are in ruins, and the fields are barren. If we do not immediately seek a fundamental relief strategy, the remaining victims will perish together.</p>
<p>Northeast Railway Negotiations</p>
<h3 id="e69">Japanese Side Puts Forward Strong Demands <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence from World News: Regarding the Northeast Railway negotiations, Kimura, Director of the South Manchuria Railway, and Gao Jiyi, Chairman of the Northeast Transportation Committee, met on the 6th at the Beining Railway Bureau's Assistant Office. The talks lasted for three hours and agreed on the principles for carrying out the negotiations. The Japanese side demanded the following items: (1) Both sides should select committee members to promptly carry out specific negotiations and should no longer use delaying tactics to avoid or restrict the Japanese side's strategy. (2) The greatest goal should be coexistence and co-prosperity and the rights and interests of both sides should be respected. (3) During the negotiations, anti-Japanese movements should never be used and anti-Japanese strategies should be effectively curbed. In addition to the four items that have already been announced, the Japanese side intends to submit additional demands. The content is very harsh and disregards our national sovereignty. The following is a summary of what was published in the Japanese newspaper in Dalian: (1) The Qikeji-Wu Xiajiu Platform and Wuchang lines hinder the interests of the South Manchuria Railway and their construction should be stopped. (2) The official Yinhao Eastern Province Special Product Office should be abolished and there should be no plan for a monopoly of the transportation of Manchurian products. (3) China and Japan should conclude an "Economic Agreement" to stop any economic competition. (4) Construction of the Jihui Railway. (5) The Railway Negotiation Committee should set up a standing office so that it can deal with various temporary events at any time.</p>
<p>In addition to the above items, there are eight other demands whose contents are unknown. According to sources on the Japanese side, the Japanese side's attitude is tough and it intends to abandon its previous moderate attitude. If the Chinese side does not agree to its demands, it intends to take decisive measures to ensure that its demands are met. As for the Ministry of the Army and the Kwantung Army Headquarters, they advocate using force to protect their vested rights and should never take a step back. This kind of crazy rhetoric is gradually being expressed publicly. How will our people deal with this?</p>
<h3 id="e70">Overseas Chinese Forced to Return Home from Russia <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Russia Implements New Economic Policy and Expels Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Thousands of Overseas Chinese Trapped at Manchuria Station</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After Russia implemented the Five-Year New Economic Plan, it forced all foreign nationals residing in the country, regardless of whether they were farmers or workers, to leave the country if they had not joined the party. Even large industrial and commercial merchants with capital of only a few tens or hundreds of yuan were not allowed to stay. A group of German refugees who had been deported from Russia to Harbin last month stated that the persecution of overseas Chinese was particularly severe. If they were engaged in business, they would be charged with various heavy taxes in an effort to make it difficult for them to survive and to force them to withdraw from Russia. In the middle of last month, the Huaqiao Wang Keju and his three sons owned a house in Vladivostok worth more than three million rubles at market price. The Russian government claimed that the land was owned by the government, and initially ordered them to demolish it, but later ordered them to sell it to the government at a price of eighty thousand rubles, which was a huge difference. The Wangs refused to comply. Before a week had passed, the Russian government's State Political Bureau summoned them and told them that they owed more than one million three hundred thousand in local donations over the years and ordered them to pay within three days, otherwise their property would be confiscated. The Wangs could not afford to pay. At the end of the month, the house was confiscated. The Wangs and his sons had no choice but to go to Harbin to appeal to the city's Chamber of Commerce to request the Northeast authorities to negotiate with Russia. In the past week, thousands of overseas Chinese in Irkutsk, Chita, Shangniaojinzi, and other areas in Russia were arrested, either on suspicion of disrupting local security or owing donations. Among them, more than 1,300 were transported by the Chita garrison to Manchuria some days ago and expelled into our country. Overseas Chinese who carried more than 30 rubles of Russian currency when crossing the customs at Daori were confiscated, and those with more than a thousand yuan were not only confiscated but also imprisoned. Therefore, many were imprisoned along the way. These returning overseas Chinese were extremely impoverished after losing their money. The 2nd Cavalry Brigade of Manchuria and the Binhai County Government, in cooperation with local landlords, set up a temporary reception center to provide assistance. A congee kitchen was established to provide a bowl of millet congee once a day and two Harbin dollars per person. The Special District and Heilongjiang authorities plan to jointly dispatch personnel to investigate and verify the status of these overseas Chinese. If they are found to be honest overseas Chinese, they will issue certificates and request that they be sent back to their native places free of charge. However, due to this, it is feared that it will not be completed in a short time, so the overseas Chinese must remain temporarily at Manchuria Station. In addition, the Chief Executive's Office purchased two thousand dan of sorghum yesterday and transported it to Manchuria Station to be distributed to the local agencies for relief. Various organizations in Harbin are also raising funds to buy grain and transport it for relief. It is also heard that a large number of overseas Chinese will be expelled from the Primorsky Province and will arrive in the country around the end of the month. (10th)</p>

<p>Continuation of the Record of Steaming Bones for Examination in the Hu Zhang Murder Case: Yesterday, the county court appointed Guo Chunrong, an autopsy official from Zhenjiang, to steam and examine the bones in the case of Hu Yinglong of Dawuqiao accused of murdering his wife. The circumstances of the examination have been previously reported in this newspaper. Today at 7:30 AM, the judge, along with the autopsy official, both parties in the case, and lawyer Gu Shouyi, and others, gathered at the Longmen Temple examination site. Autopsy official Guo steamed and examined the various bone remains. After a considerable amount of time, they were taken out and examined. The examination revealed that the roots of the upper and lower teeth were red, there was a two-inch diameter red mark on the left ear root, there were bloodstains on the left kidney bone, all five fingers of the left hand had red bloodstains on the second joint, there were kicking marks on the muscles of the right leg bone, and there was a blood halo on the right tibia. It was determined that the deceased died by hanging after being injured, because the person used a wide cloth to hang from the left side, the blood fell to the left. After the examination, a report was made and the remains were photographed. However, the accuser Zhang Ziyu stated that she had seen her sister healthy the day before her death. The next day, the Hu residence reported that she had died suddenly from an acute illness and did not mention death by hanging. By the time the examination was completed, it was noon, and after a long time of waiting, the steaming bone examination was concluded. The process of legal proceedings then began.</p>

<p>Suzhou Robbery Suspect Arrested in Wuxi: Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the county police's major water patrol team, reported on the previous day that Hu Xianzhang, a patrol officer from the 13th team of the 3rd district of the Suzhou water police, reported that a Gao Da, a fugitive who had robbed the Xu family outside the Xie Fengmen in Huangtiandang, Suzhou, and shot the victim, was hiding in Wuxi and requested assistance in the arrest. After receiving the report, Captain Qian immediately dispatched special agent Wang Jinbiao to lead the team members, along with patrol officer Hu, to apprehend the suspect. They arrested the fugitive Gao Da near the Tingzi Bridge outside the East Gate and took him into temporary custody. Yesterday, Captain Qian prepared a document and sent him to the headquarters for interrogation. It is reported that Gong Guoliang, the chief of the third district stationed in Suzhou, also learned that the robber Gao Da had been arrested in Wuxi and immediately prepared an official document and sent someone to Wuxi to bring him back for legal proceedings. Major Wang approved the request to bring him back for handling according to the law.</p>
<p>Newspaper Delivery Industry Unable to Form Association: Various industries in the county are actively forming industry associations. Previously, ten companies, including the Paibao Office and the Xishan Paibao Society, initiated the formation of an industry association and submitted a request to the County Party Rectification Committee for a permit and guidance. After receiving the report, the committee, due to doubts about the nature of the industry, immediately sent a telegram to the Provincial Party Rectification Committee for verification. Yesterday, they received instructions stating that the nature of newspaper delivery is similar to sales and agency and is not an industrial or commercial activity and thus cannot form an industrial or commercial association. However, since newspapers have been recognized as having a commercial nature and can form associations and join chambers of commerce, it seems appropriate to provide relief to the newspaper delivery industry.</p>
<p>Tragic News of a Girl Crushed to Death by a Car: The Tonghui Road Guangxing Automobile Company in this county is operated by driver Liu Shunrong and is quite prosperous. The other day, one of the company's twenty-fourth car, driven from Meiyuan to the city, crushed to death a girl named Hui Fang (age seven), the daughter of Zhu Zuqi, a resident of Jiangxiang, at Heikou, leaving a bloody mess.

After reporting the case to the county for investigation, the bandits had already fled far away. The area is located on the border with Jiangyin. In January of this year, Gu Junyi, the head of the Qin Nan Township Security Corps in Jiangyin County, learned that the bandits in the case were hiding in Huangqiao. He immediately went to search, arrest, and detain Zhu Ayuan and Zhu Ajin, two accomplices, and handed them over to the Jiangyin County Government. After repeated court hearings, the facts were clarified yesterday, and Zhu Ayuan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and Zhu Ajin to eight months to deter others.</p>

Yesterday, Director Chen and a party of eight arrived in Wuxi from Suzhou and went to the West Gate to inspect the Seventh Brigade Headquarters of the Customs Investigation and also to the Public Sports Field to inspect the officers and police of the First and Third Squadrons and the Commercial Patrol Team. Director Chen also gave a speech. In the afternoon, they toured the scenic spots and are scheduled to go to Cheng today to inspect the Ninth Team.</p>
<p>The Seat Donation is Still Charged by Restaurants on Behalf: Previously, the Xiyi cuisine industry did not collect the education surtax for self-organized banquets, which affected business. After deliberation by the entire industry, it was decided that the surcharge would no longer be collected from March 1st, and a request was submitted to the county government to maintain this. The county government, according to the provisions of Article 2 of the Collection Regulations, states that Chinese and Western vegetarian restaurants selling seaweed, hotels and inns hosting banquets, cooking boats hosting banquets, and boat owners hosting banquets must collect donations from customers on behalf of the government. The restaurant industry did not receive approval to submit a request to stop collecting on behalf of the government, which is a violation of the regulations. The County Political Affairs Conference resolved that the restaurant industry should still be responsible for collecting the surcharge on behalf. Yesterday, a public notice was issued stating that restaurants and cooking staff must still collect the banquet surcharge on behalf and must not change their names to self-organized in an attempt to evade the charge.</p>

<p>County Rectification Committee Advocates Transfer of Soil Case Jurisdiction: The County Party Rectification Committee, in response to Huang Bingying's report to the Provincial Government regarding Yang Bingwei's discovery of opium in the Chengqin border area, suddenly had mimeographed leaflets circulating on the market on the 6th of this month, titled "Details of the Division of the Jiangyin Giant Soil Case" and addressed to party and government agencies, newspapers, etc. The committee believes that this case should be transferred to another jurisdiction. Yesterday, they specially submitted a request to the Provincial Rectification Committee to forward it to the Provincial Government for an order to transfer the case to another jurisdiction to avoid suspicion. Moreover, Rectification Committee members Gao Kangfu and Meng Yaping stated that the leaflet mentioned that Gao and Committee Member Meng Yaping each received 400 yuan, etc. It is determined that the person who distributed the leaflet is highly suspected to be Huang Bingying based on the circumstances. A special letter was presented to the Rectification Committee instructing the County Public Security Bureau to arrest Huang Fuju on the 13th. That night, Huang was released on bail and was interrogated by County Magistrate Li on the 14th.</p>

On the 13th, the two officials Li and Zhang returned to Nantong from Dongtai to investigate Zhang Jian's confiscated illegal assets, which totaled more than sixty rooms that had not been sealed. Because they had not been valued, they could not be divided. On the 14th, they returned to the province to ask for instructions.</p>
<p>Problem of Converting Public Funds: The charitable education funds of Nantong that are stored in pawnshops were previously calculated in cash. Currently, due to the conversion into silver dollars, there has been a dispute. The County Government submitted a request to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation, which ordered that the funds should be converted according to the price of cash and silver dollars at the time of deposit so as to avoid one party suffering the loss. However, the public funds were deposited in pawnshops as far back as the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, there were only silver taels, so it is still difficult to resolve at this time.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of my client, the China Marine Engineers Association, who, after reading the domestic news column of your newspaper on the 12th of this month, found a special dispatch stating that the Daji wheel steam boiler exploded and sank. The location of the incident was Dasheng Port. The cause of the incident was that the ship carried soldiers engaged in customs investigation and dozens of packages of sulfur. Unexpectedly, the soldiers carelessly dropped cigarette butts into the sulfur, causing a portion to catch fire, but it did not spread to the entire cargo, and there was no explosion of the steam boiler. The association has verified that the ship's hull is currently in Shanghai, and the engine is intact. Therefore, the information in your newspaper does not match the facts. The members of the association serving on the Daji wheel have a great reputation at stake and are asking me to write a letter to correct the information. Therefore, I am writing to you to request that you correct the information based on the facts so that the reputation of all the members of my client will not be harmed. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Yu Hualong, March 15th</p>

<p>Zhenru Achieves a Draw, Resulting in a One-to-One Tie in the Scene of the English Navy Westerners' League A Group Match: Zhenru's Athletes Promote Their Spirit of Fearlessness. Under the One-to-Zero Defeat, They Scored a Goal in the Last Two Minutes, Achieving a Draw with the English Navy. At That Time, the Atmosphere of the Entire Venue Was Full of Misery. Suddenly, a Smile Appeared and Laughter Shook Ears. Between Reversal, It Makes People Feel Sangcang. The Peace of A Football Match in the League A Group Match of Westerners Ends. Referee Li Silian.</p>

<p>How Unfortunate Is Zhenru, When Approaching To Attack the Navy, The Accurate and Agile Feet Was Misused, So It First Suffered the Pain of Losing Ground. Only Its Bravery is Overwhelming and Its Efforts in Combat Heaven Never Fails the Sincere. Finally, in the Last Two Minutes, Chen Zhenhe Rushed Into The Goal and Scored a Draw. This Is Also a Great Luck In the Midst of Misfortune. To discuss the facts, the Strength of Zhenru's Center Line is Indeed Impressive. Zhuang Shihong and Chen Jiaqiu are Especially Outstanding. The Forwards and Midfielders Get Their Assistance. The Outside Offense Gains Momentum, and the Inside Defense Is Powerful. Once Zhuang Shihong's Ankle is Injured and It Is Inconvenient to Walk, He Is Driven by Love for the School to Ease the Concern of Military Hearts, Which is No Less Than Strength in Internal and External Offense and Defense.</p>

<p>Zhenru's Talents Today are Organized and Impressive. Compared with the Glory of the Old Days, There Is Not Much Difference. The Only Difference Is That The Forwards' Shots are Lacking and the Goalkeeper Lacks Experience. The Two Are The Key to The Victory Or Defeat of The Entire Army, The Relationship Is Significant, But Compared To Each Other, The Latter Feels More Important. Like the Battle Yesterday, The Goal That Zhenru Lost the Ball From The Left Side And Then Leaked Into The Hands of The Goalkeeper. At That Time, If He Can Step Forward, Even If He Misses, He Will Still Be Outside the Goalpost. Once Again, Jiang Shanjing Blocks The Enemy's Goalkeeper When Seeing The Opportunity Should Come Forward to Save an Emergency. If This Picture Only Holds The Door Sitting and Watching People Attack This Ball Is Not Without Good Luck.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the English Navy Also Sent Representatives from the Brogh克 Warship to Play. The Whole Team Was Physically Strong and The Ball Skills Were Pure. Compared with the Team That Drew with Lehua, There Is a World of Difference. The Central Defender Burghart Responded In A Proper Way. The Right Center Forward Lunt Met Sat In Three Passes. Goalkeeper Clark Stands Alone and Is A Well-Known General In The Team. The Goalkeeping Skills Are More Than The Others. It Has Saved Danger and Rescued Surrounded For As Many As Seven Or Eight Times, And It Is In The Above Generals Who Rescue Danger And Seize The Ball Break The Siege Is Not Less Than Seven Or Eight Times, And It Is Difficult For Others To Avoid The Hate of Losing Foot.</p>

<p>Zhenru, With The Help of The Wind, Tong Rongwen Took the Lead, Killing on the Border. The Ball Fell in the Center. The Goalkeeper Received the Ball. The Five Fronts Fought in Melee. The Goalkeeper Evaded and Seized the Danger to Break Out. Since Then, Zhenru Has Continued to Advance. It Was Difficult to Succeed Because of the Navy's Effective Resistance. Navy Counterattacked. Central Defender Burghart Kicked a Free Kick From A Distance of 45 Yards. The Ball Went Straight To The Goal Like an Arrow. The Goalkeeper Caught It And Handed It Over to The Forward. From Fu Heyuan, Luo Haiguang to Dai Linjing Welcomed The Goal With One Kick. The English Goalkeeper Calmly Saved It, And All the Efforts Were Abandoned. Thirty Minutes Later, Zhuang Shihong Was Injured and Out of the Game.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Both Goals Are Safe <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Zhenru Suffered This Accident and the Strength Was Reduced Compared with Before, but the Spirit Was Still Exuberant. Chen Zhenhe Was Transferred Back From the Forward and Transferred to Central Defender. Since Then, the Time Was Still in Progress. After Ten Minutes, Zhuang Still Fought to Boost Morale. At That Time, It Was Flat and Unremarkable. Tong Rongwen Suddenly Made an Amazing Move and Shot the Goal. The Goalkeeper Punched It Again Without Effect. In the First Half, Each Dragon Gate Was Safe.</p>

<p>Changing the Land to Fight Again, Dai Luo Cooperated to Invade, but Was Blocked Midway. The Ball Tendency Reverted, Feng Jiang Insisted and Returned to the Enemy. Tong Rongwen Picked the Ball in Front of the Gate. The Two Armies Fought Each Other. The Goal Was Ten Feet Before. It Was Difficult to Handle Each Other. It Was Difficult to Launch the Ball. Dai's Second Plan Was To Steal Into The Enemy's Camp, Even Though It Was A Corner Kick. Fu and 萓 Got Chen Zhenhe's Ball Picked and Sent Appropriately. The Goalkeeper Fell to the Ground. Zhuang Shihong's Injured Feet Kicked the Person. The Ball Was Taken Out by the Navy Forward in One Line and Advanced. Feng Yunyou's Reverse Body Was Too Late. The Center Forward 批合司 Took The Opportunity to Attack the Gate. Xie's Goalkeeper's Actions Failed and the Enemy Camp Was Not Seized. He Was Wronged.</p>

<p>Chen Zhenhe, with One Goal Lost, Can Not Be Redeemed by a Difficult Fight. The Important Position of the Center Was Entrusted to the Up-and-Coming Chen Jiaqiu, and He Himself Returned to The Forward of The Seizure and Break Through. The Second Transfer Created a Lot of Storms, but Because The Other Goalkeeper's Skills Were High, It Was of No Practical Use. Suddenly, Our Army Warned That The Ball Fell From The Sky. The Navy's Two Forwards Carried It Forward. Jiang Turned Back To Stop It. Xie's Goalkeeper Saw The Opportunity, but Did Not Step Forward. The Center Forward Chased and Kicked the Middle Post to Bounce Back and Out of Danger. Zhenru Witnessed That The Battle Was About to End. The General Trend Was Even More Dangerous. Each Took The Spirit of Fearlessness and Marched Forward. There Were Three Opportunities to Knock on the Gate. Unexpectedly, the Goalkeeper's Skills Were Superb, But They Changed Danger to Safety. The Last Time, Fu Heyuan Picked from the Left to The Center. The Goalkeeper Was Squeezed Forward. Chen Zhenhe and The Ball Entered The Net At The Same Time. The Time Was Only Two Minutes Away From The End. The Result of the Game Was A One-to-One Draw.</p>

In the first half, the Jewish team took a 2-1 lead and had high hopes, but unfortunately, in the second half, the English team scored five consecutive goals, turning the tide. The Jewish team's lineup remained largely unchanged, while the English team made significant adjustments. Within three minutes of the start of the game, Jewish player S. Greenberg cleverly passed the ball to Pan Keque, who scored. Shortly after, T. Greenberg scored from an oblique angle, making it 2-0. The English team's momentum was not good, so they quickly launched a counterattack. Gray Tormo and Graham both missed shots, but at this time, the Jewish goalkeeper was already busy dealing with the attacks. Eventually, English player Murphy scored a goal, making the score 2-1 at halftime. In the second half, the English team's offensive was extremely strong. Murphy scored another goal, and their momentum increased. The five forwards surrounded the opponent's goal like rapid-fire cannons. In addition, Jewish players Pan Keque and S. Greenberg were injured one after another and could not respond to the attacks. The English team took the opportunity to advance, with Gray Tormo scoring two goals, and Miller and Graham each scoring one goal. As a result, the English team won 6-2.

<p>The Preparatory Committee of the 15th North China Games in Jinan publicly elected Committee Member He Siyuan to draft the organizational outline of the conference. After consulting with various sports experts, the draft has been completed. The content of the organization was briefly reported in a previous letter. Here is news from the Shanghai sports community: The organizational outline of the North China Conference, which was previously drafted, has now undergone slight changes. The original plan was to have one chairman, one chief executive, and two deputy chief executives, with two departments below, and a separate Competition Committee. Now, the chairman, chief executive, etc., remain the same, but there are now three departments: Administrative, Engineering, and Competition. In addition, there is a separate Competition Committee. The Administrative Department is responsible for arrangements, reception, publicity, finance, and other matters. The Engineering Department has two divisions: engineering and design. The Competition Department includes registration, refereeing, and record-keeping for track and field events, baseball, softball, and team ball games. The Competition Committee consists of five to seven members and is responsible for resolving disputes arising during the competition and is the highest judicial body of the conference. The amended organizational outline is currently awaiting review by the Preparatory Committee because Director He (Siyuan) is inspecting party affairs and education in Jiaodong. In addition, the provincial government's standing committee today (the 13th) was unable to discuss the budget proposal for the North China Games venue and conference expenses because only four members of the provincial committee were present, which was less than the legal quorum. The proposal to hold a preliminary competition in the province for the North China Games was also not brought up. In addition, the preliminary competition in the province for the men's senior, intermediate, and women's divisions of this North China Games will be organized in accordance with the North China regulations, without distinguishing between senior and intermediate levels. In addition, Shang Shumei, a sports expert from Beiping, was invited by the provincial preparatory committee to Jinan to discuss conference matters. Because of his duties with the upcoming North China ball games, Mr. Shang is scheduled to return to Beiping tonight by train and is scheduled to return to Jinan on April 1st. It is also reported that the date of the North China Conference is scheduled to be held on May 25th. The preliminary competition in the province will be held before May 25th.</p>

<h3 id="e111">On the Decline of Chinese Fisheries Schools and the Fishing Industry by Li Zuchao <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The backwardness of various industries in China is a well-recognized and indisputable fact among Chinese people. Taking the Chinese fishing industry as an example, fisheries schools have been established in coastal provinces, with the government investing huge amounts of money to lay the foundation for cultivating talent for the fishing industry. It would be appropriate for talented people to emerge in great numbers, engage in practical industries with rich experience and learning, and strive to build and actively work to reverse the decadent and lazy customs of decades ago. However, today, things have turned out otherwise. When I was studying in Japan, I heard that the fisheries schools in China were divided into two factions, North and South, with teachers and teachers forming factions and students and students also forming factions. Schools are responsible for enlightening future generations, and academic studies should be practical, with training aimed at being useful. What factions are there to divide? Dividing into North and South is already inappropriate. Within one faction, teachers and students should be harmonious and seamless. However, teachers have their own parties, and students have their own factions, like fire and water that cannot approach each other. Is this not even more harsh? Moreover, since this faction is like this, the other faction should learn from this mistake, correct its faults, and not follow in its footsteps. Unexpectedly, they imitate each other and are exactly the same. Within one school, they harbor resentment and slander each other. In that case, between the North and South factions, among the parties of teachers and students, there are even more factions within factions. The competent administrative authorities, in addition to issuing education funds on time, do not pay much attention to the content of the school. When there is a disturbance at the school, they occasionally send one or two people to investigate. Those who are sent are often not familiar with fisheries schools and do not conduct detailed investigations from all sides, but simply ask the principal and complete their duties. How the school's style should be rectified and how academic affairs should be planned are never questioned. Moreover, the principals of fisheries schools are sometimes not from a fisheries background, so they naturally lack relevant knowledge, experience, and qualifications in fisheries affairs. If the principal lacks fisheries knowledge, what good qualities can the teachers have? It is easy to imagine. If the actual situation of fisheries schools is like this, their achievements are also predictable. Now, if you want to seek talent from schools, talk about fishing profits, and develop industries, how can you achieve it? As far as the fishing industry is concerned, the government does not provide adequate protection for fishing boats, and pirates are rampant, allowing them to harass fishermen. Not only do capitalists not dare to risk investing large sums of money in large-scale fishing operations, but even fishermen who have been in the sea for a long time are afraid of it. If this is the case, how can we expect the fishing industry to develop? This is like heading south while wanting to go north. Japanese fishing boats take advantage of the opportunity to enter our territorial waters, and their fishing vessels, seine nets, and hand-operated net fishing boats run rampant in our country's territorial waters without any scruples, so that the fishing profits along the coast are completely invaded. The fish they catch are sold freely in our country without any restrictions. The amount of loss each year is more than hundreds of thousands. This is truly cause for crying and long sighs. The situation of fisheries schools is like this, and the loss of fishing rights is also like that. How can the fishing industry prosper, and how can economic rights not flow out? For the sake of the present, we can only hope that the government will find ways to rectify the fisheries schools. Teachers and students must be made to resolve prejudices, eliminate various factions, and have a consistent spirit. Do not allow teachers and students to use the school to stir up trouble and shout slogans of overthrowing and supporting each other. Teachers should fulfill their teaching responsibilities, and students should fulfill their learning benefits. Talent can naturally rise, and the country will not be so degenerate. As for coastal fisheries, piracy must be effectively prevented, and fishing boats must be protected with all efforts, so that the people of the country know that fishing has great profits and fishing vessels increase daily. If we can develop one part of the fishing industry, we can reduce one part of the invasion, which is much more effective than relying on empty words for diplomatic protests. I humbly offer my views and hope to discuss them with those who pay attention to the fisheries school industry.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Cotton Production Conference <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening ceremony was held, and two groups of proposal review committee members were appointed. They will continue the meeting at 8:00 AM today. The National Cotton Production Improvement and Statistics Conference held its opening ceremony yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Chinese Merchants Cotton Exchange at No. 80 Avenue Edward VII. The event was extremely grand. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Representatives from the Ministry of Industry, including Mu Ouchu; Zhang Zongcheng and Chen Bingquan from the Ministry of Industry and the Central Promotion Committee; Pan Gongzhan from the Municipal Party Department and Social Affairs Bureau; Feng Liutang and Zheng Hongnian representing the Municipal Government; Zhang Xiangshi representing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Qi Haishan from the China Cotton Industry Federation; Zou Bingwen, Ye Yuanding, and Cheng Youfu from the Commodity Inspection Bureau; Huang Dingxun from the Industry and Commerce Delegation; Zhu Xianfang from the China Textile Institute; Zhao Lianfang from Central University's Agricultural College; Chen Yanshan from Jinling University's Agricultural College; Li Lubin from Nantong Agricultural College; Wang Jinwu from Zhejiang University's Agricultural College; Rong Zongjing, Guo Le, Guo Shun, Ding Ruoting, Yan Yutang, Chen Zixin, Zhang Zemin representing yarn factories; and over a hundred representatives from provincial cotton fields, agricultural and cotton industry organizations, agricultural and mining departments, and construction departments. Rong Zongjing was elected as chairman, and Ji Zifeng and Qin Xinnong as recorders.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Procedures: (1) Bowing deeply to the national flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (2) Reading the will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (3) Silent tribute; (4) Chairman's address (Rong Zongjing); (5) Report by the Preparatory Committee on the preparations; (6) Instructions from the Minister of Industry (represented by Mu Xiangyue); (7) Address by the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department (Pan Gongzhan); (8) Address by the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Government (Feng Liutang); (9) Addresses by guests; (10) Adoption of the conference agenda; (11) Election of the conference presidium; (12) Election of the proposal review committee; (13) Photograph session and adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: The long-awaited National Cotton Production Improvement and Statistics Conference has officially opened here today. I am greatly honored that central and local officials have come to give instructions, and representatives from various organizations and groups concerned with cotton planting have come to participate. On behalf of the various organizations that initiated this conference, I extend a warm welcome to all participants. I sincerely hope that under the guidance of officials and with the support of all sectors, China's cotton production will be effectively improved and accurately statistically recorded from now on. This will benefit not only cotton planters and users but also the national economy and people's livelihood. Cotton is the primary material for clothing in our country, and the amount of raw cotton needed each year is enormous. Imports of foreign cotton have been increasing year by year. In 1930, imports of foreign cotton increased to over 2.7 million dan, worth over 100 million taels of silver. At the current precious metal era, the value is even more than that. China ranks third among cotton-producing countries, but solely because production is not expanding and quality is not improving, foreign cotton flows in continuously and money flows out. In the future, there will be a trend of cotton products becoming more refined. If the cotton planting industry does not quickly catch up, expand production, and improve quality, the leakage will be even greater in the future, and the national loss will be immeasurable. In recent years, countries such as the United States, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Japan have all been promoting cotton planting in their colonies to reduce their dependence on foreign countries for raw cotton. China's soil is extremely suitable for cotton planting and is originally a cotton-producing country, yet it still relies on foreign countries for raw cotton. This is not just a matter of monetary loss but also a shame for the entire nation. A few months ago, when the British economic survey team came to Shanghai and met for the first time, they inquired earnestly about China's cotton planting. Their emphasis on China's cotton planting industry is such that our people should pay even more attention to it. Now, the cotton planting circles in various provinces deeply know that the improvement of cotton production and the detailed preparation of statistics cannot be delayed. Therefore, they have jointly initiated this conference. I am confident that all parties will be able to cooperate consistently to ensure that the raw cotton consumed in our country can gradually be self-sufficient and need not be taken from foreign countries. Furthermore, our country will have surplus high-quality cotton to be transported and sold to foreign countries. This will not only plug a huge leak for the country internally but also open up a huge source of profit for the country externally. This is the ultimate goal of this conference. I sincerely hope that central and local officials will provide various forms of support, promotion, and facilitation to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Report by the Preparatory Committee: Preparatory Committee member Jiang Dixian reported on the preparations as follows: (1) Origin of the conference: Initially, our Yarn Factory Association has been conducting cotton production statistics for twelve years, but progress has been limited. The biggest reason is the lack of funds, but unfamiliarity with the situation in various places is also a reason. That is, the investigators in various provinces also suffer from the inability to clarify the methods. Therefore, it was proposed to invite investigators from various provinces to come to Shanghai to discuss everything, and there was a plan for a cotton production statistics conference. Later, because in recent years, the investigation of cotton production in various provinces was mostly handled by provincial cotton fields, various parties thought of using this opportunity to contact each other and discuss improvement issues. The scope of improvement issues was very large, and at first, we did not dare to join the conference. However, because most provinces expressed their agreement, it was changed to the Cotton Production Improvement and Statistics Conference. Since the conference was changed to include improvement, there were many people who should be added. However, due to the urgency of time, it was not possible to invite everyone. Therefore, the initiators still adhered to the originally planned one provincial cotton field or farm or cotton industry group per province and our Yarn Factory Association. We sincerely hope that all parties will understand. Fortunately, we all have the same goal of developing China's cotton production, and it does not matter whether we initiate it or not. (2) The improvement or statistics of cotton production requires a lot of money. In European and American countries, the state is responsible for handling it. Now, the domestic political situation is indeed moving towards a better state, but there are still many urgent construction projects that cannot be actively developed. The biggest difficulty is, of course, economic problems. With our strength, we are not enough to talk about this at first. Therefore, the purpose of the conference is not to expect too much results. The biggest hope is to connect the agencies in various provinces that are actually engaged in cotton planting, so that they can exchange reports on the national cotton production situation, get to know each other, and jointly discuss the overall improvement and promotion methods of the national cotton production under the current situation. Secondly, it is to gather cotton fields, farms, or cotton industry organizations from various provinces to jointly discuss the national cotton production statistics and estimation plan. Division of labor and cooperation may make some progress. We deeply know that everyone is currently in a difficult situation. A great plan must be expected in the future and cannot be carried out for a while. However, paying attention to gradual progress within the scope of our capabilities may not be in vain and without benefit to the facts. (3) This conference focuses on research. Therefore, in addition to focusing on the discussion of methods, we also pay special attention to lectures. It is hoped that the pioneers in domestic cotton planting research will give technical guidance to the participants, so that they can return to imitate and implement. Thirteen people have been invited to give lectures, and all the topics have been decided by various parties according to their needs. The topics can be roughly divided into four categories: (1) four people belong to the breeding aspect; (2) three people belong to the promotion aspect; (3) three people belong to the statistical estimation aspect; (4) one person belongs to each of the other aspects, such as inspection, fiber engineering, and cotton industry economy. Whether in academics or in experiments, they all have profound research and will definitely give us an increase in knowledge. This is the common feeling of the representatives and participants of this conference from various provinces. The lecture time has been scheduled and copied on another paper and will not be repeated here. It can be said that the goals of all participants are the same, and it is necessary to adopt the meaning of freedom and fully express opinions from all parties. For example, the issue of the qualifications and voting rights of the participants has been inquired about a lot beforehand. The preparatory meeting yesterday also carefully discussed the results. The qualifications of the participants will not be distinguished, and the voting rights will be based on the number of attendees. That is, we hope to accommodate more opinions from all parties. However, one point should be noted, that is, when discussing a proposal and voting on it, the highest principle is whether the content of the proposal can be implemented under the current situation. However, at present, it seems necessary to pay more attention to the implementation aspect. (5) Personal talent is weak and I cannot bear the responsibility of preparation. In fact, it is impossible to shirk. I have tried my best to do things with many shortcomings, and I am very sorry. I hope that the guests and representatives from various provinces will understand. The preparations for the conference are roughly as described above. Today is the opening day, and cotton industry experts from the country are gathered together. I am really happy.</p>
<p>Minister Kong's Instructions: This time, the Yarn Factory Association and the cotton industry organizations in ten provinces and regions of cotton production jointly initiated the China Cotton Production Improvement and Statistics Conference in Shanghai, which is really a very gratifying thing. Xiangxi is fortunate to be the head of the industry and has infinite hope and optimism for this conference. Now that the military affairs are over and the political tutelage has begun, it is appropriate to gather the common strength of the government and the people to work hard on construction. There are thousands of things to be built. On the government's side, it can only plan for the big and the far, and remove obstacles. The progress of all undertakings depends on the people who have been engaged in the undertaking for a long time, and everyone works hard according to their ability. Only in this way can various construction undertakings be hoped to be carried out simultaneously. This conference is completely initiated and organized by the people's organizations to study the improvement and statistics of China's cotton production, to urge the progress of China's cotton production, and to seek the development of China's cotton industry. This is really a gratifying phenomenon. Because cotton production is one of the most important agricultural products in our country, cotton textile is also the most important industry that once occupied the first place in our country, and cotton products are really necessary for the people of the whole country. The possibility of its future development is very large, and its relationship with the national economy is very close and important. For decades, imports of foreign cotton goods have often occupied the first place in imported goods. In recent years, due to the large quantity of various cotton goods imported, the loss of the national economy is more than 300 million yuan per year. Therefore, it is said that if we want to seek the self-reliance of our country's national economy, we must first seek the full self-sufficiency of cotton goods. However, if we want to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency of cotton goods, it is not only an industrial problem but also an agricultural problem. Because the quality and quantity of cotton production in our country cannot meet the needs of the existing cotton textile industry, the average import of foreign cotton has been more than 2 million dan in recent years. If we further promote the cotton textile industry, the shortage of raw cotton will be even greater. Therefore, if we want to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency of cotton goods, improving and promoting cotton production and developing the cotton textile industry are equally important. This conference brings together cotton industry experts from cotton producing provinces and regions to study and discuss the improvement and promotion of cotton production in our country. The impact of this conference can directly promote the improvement of cotton production quality and the increase in quantity, and indirectly help the development of our country's cotton textile industry. The importance of the relationship is like this. This is why Xiangxi has infinite hope and optimism for this conference. Now, all construction cases require the cooperation of the government and the people. In the future, there are places where government subsidies are needed for various progresses related to cotton production. The government should do its best to jointly promote the improvement and promotion of cotton production to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency of cotton goods and to seek self-reliance in our national economy. Now, at the beginning of the conference, I would like to express my hopes to encourage all attendees.</p>
<p>Address by the Municipal Party Department: Pan Gongzhan, representative of the Municipal Party Department, said briefly that the convening of this grand meeting in Shanghai by cotton industry officials from various provinces expresses great hope. We are all familiar with the national cotton industry and national salvation policy. Cotton production used to be more than 10 million dan, but now it has dropped to 7 million dan. The output has decreased and the quality has deteriorated. Although China has good cotton, such as real cotton, due to various reasons such as mixing of agriculture and commerce and transportation, it is not as convenient as using foreign cotton. Now the production of raw cotton is decreasing, the quality is deteriorating, and the yarn factories are gradually increasing. The progress of cotton production and spindles is not proportional. Therefore, the progress of the national textile industry is tantamount to promoting foreign cotton. If we want to save China, we must make the quality and supply of cotton equal. Now we gather cotton industry experts to discuss improvement. The Municipal Party Department hopes that this conference will have excellent and satisfactory results. Minister of Industry said that the government is very hopeful to cooperate with the people, and the future is promising. If cotton production is improved and the quantity is increased, transportation must be convenient, and the tax rate must be suitable for the business situation. Although this is not directly related, in fact, the development of the cotton industry must be noted. If you have any opinions, please discuss them as much as possible so that the government can refer to them and achieve the effect of cooperation between the government and the people. The Municipal Party Department has no other expectations.</p>
<p>Feng Liutang's Address: Feng Liutang, representative of Shanghai Mayor Zhang, said briefly that Mayor Zhang paid great attention to this conference, but he was unable to attend due to busy official duties. He asked me to be the representative. The first issue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood is clothing, and there is also a detailed plan in the industrial plan. The purpose is to supply people with cheap cotton goods. Cotton textile is the first, and the raw material of textile is cotton. If cotton goods are cheap, the raw material must first be cheap, and the quality must also be improved. For example, if you want to spin fine yarn, you must use long-staple cotton. The quality of medium cotton cannot be used for fine yarn, and you have to buy foreign cotton. Now that the price of gold is high, it is impossible to get cheap cotton goods. If you don't achieve self-sufficiency in raw materials, it is impossible. Since the Republic of China, China has paid attention to improvement, and there is still this foundation today, so you have to promote the success of the Yarn Factory Association. However, because you cannot cooperate fully, there are more than 2 million dan of foreign cotton imported today. The United States reports cotton production statistics on time every year, while China's cotton production ranks third in the world. There is very little statistics on this, only the Yarn Factory Association has it, but the omissions cannot be denied. The reason for this is that various parties cannot do their best to assist. Now that representatives of cotton fields and cotton industry organizations from thirteen provinces are gathered to discuss, this answer should be able to obtain good results. Shanghai is originally a cotton-producing area, but on the one hand, it is a concentrated market for the cotton industry, and on the other hand, it is a center for the textile industry. Therefore, Shanghai is very eager for this conference and wishes it to be Lancashire in the West and Osaka in the East.</p>
<p>Zou Bingwen's Address: Zou Bingwen, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, first reported on the past work on cotton crops. In the past, people did not understand and the government did not assist, which caused many difficulties. Now the situation is different. If there is a tight plan and method, contributing to the government and the people will work together to actively carry out, the effect should be more significant. There are three suggestions: (1) have the spirit of unity and mutual assistance; (2) the industry must continue to subsidize based on past results; (3) agricultural improvement is a matter for the government, and I hope the government will be responsible for carrying it out.</p>
<p>Zhang Zongcheng's Address: Zhang Zongcheng, representative of the Central Agricultural Promotion Committee, said briefly that the first priority of nation-building is people's livelihood, and people's livelihood is especially important for clothing. The importance of cotton for the needs of the people is evident. This conference opens a new era in the history of China's cotton industry. However, the importance of the conference lies in the results of the conference. This association is a collection of cotton planting organizations and textile industry groups. There are experts and government representatives. The results can be expected to be satisfactory. There have been many grand conferences in the past, but the results are very vague. I hope that experts will contribute all the crystallized research results to the cotton industry organizations, report the achievements they have obtained for research, and discuss how to divide the work, how to cooperate, and jointly seek the progress of China's cotton industry.</p>
<p>Mu Ouchu's Speech: Mu Ouchu, former Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, said briefly that today we gather national cotton industry experts and representatives of competent authorities from various provinces in one room to study and discuss the improvement and statistics of cotton production in our country. It is really an unprecedented grand event. Xiangyue is very happy to be able to attend this event. The reason why all undertakings in our country are not developed is that agriculture, industry, commerce, and academics cannot be united and connected. Those engaged in agriculture, industry, and commerce often do not know academics, and those engaged in academics often do not know agriculture, industry, and commerce. However, if you want to seek the development of an undertaking, the fundamental basis is in academics. The political evolution and industrial development of European, American, and Japanese countries are completely based on advanced science. Industrial revolution is caused by scientific invention, and industrial revolution affects social organization and political organization. The result is industrial scientization and political scientization. Not only industrial countries are like this, but agricultural countries are also scientifically washed by scientific inventions and industrial revolutions, and the result is agricultural scientization. So, to sum up, the development of all undertakings in European, American, and Japanese countries is based on advanced science, while our country is not. Our country's old culture has always focused on literature and philosophy, and lacks science. Therefore, the general public not only has no scientific inventions, but also lacks scientific literacy. With such a lack of scientific foundation, the people are also in the era of world transportation. European, American, and Japanese countries, with their mass-produced products after scientific inventions and industrial revolutions, came to China like a surging tide, making our country completely unable to resist and had to succumb to this world trend and be forced to trade. Therefore, in the decades of trade between China and foreign countries, China's commerce has shown unprecedented development, but it is completely passive. The agriculture and industry of this country are still in their infancy and have not yet reached the stage of development. The so-called commercial development is not due to the development of agriculture and industry in this country, but is developed from actually speaking, the bulk of commerce is completely burdened with foreign goods to promote sales for foreigners. Therefore, the more developed the commerce, the more difficult the national economy, and the more difficult the national livelihood. The only reason is that the agriculture and industry of our country do not have advanced science as their foundation, and the development of all commerce is passive. The same is true of the cotton industry. Xiangyue has seen this and deeply knows the importance of agronomy and the relationship between cotton production and our country, and has been committed to this for 20 years. It is only that there are few people and it is not easy to see the effect. Fortunately, the general trend is that the people of the country have a deep understanding of this, and everyone knows that the cotton textile industry is the pioneer of developing industry, and the improvement of cotton production is a necessary foundation for promoting the cotton textile industry. At the beginning of the national government's political tutelage, it focuses on construction, encourages progress, and rewards talents. At this time, you gentlemen are holding this unprecedented conference to conduct practical research on the improvement and promotion of cotton production. All the gentlemen attending the meeting are cotton industry experts and have deep research on all aspects of cotton production issues. There is no need for Xiangyue to say more. The results of this conference will definitely have a very good impact on the future of cotton production. Xiangyue is overjoyed and sincerely hopes that you gentlemen will use scientific methods to improve cotton production and economic methods to promote cotton production, so that the future of cotton production in our country will become increasingly developed and can be on par with the cotton production of the United States of America to benefit cotton farmers and the entire national economy. I am willing to pray to the end. Then Vice Minister Zheng of the Ministry of Industry successively gave speeches, the main idea of which was that we should cooperate to seek improvement.</p>

<p>Definite measures before May. Wang Zhengting's statement yesterday. Our reporter interviewed Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting yesterday to inquire about the progress of the negotiations on the abolition of consular jurisdiction. He replied that the extraterritoriality negotiations have made considerable progress. Before May 1, the declaration should be maintained and there should be definite measures. When asked about the signing date of the Sino-Swiss Commercial Treaty and the date when the French ambassador would arrive in Beijing, he replied that the signing of the Sino-Swiss Commercial Treaty is now only a matter of time, but the date has not yet been decided. The French ambassador will leave Beijing tomorrow (i.e. today) and can arrive in Beijing next week to meet.</p>

<p>The end of February is difficult to implement. The end of January is more suitable. The Shanghai Money Trade Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: In reply, we received a letter stating that the closing date for the 20th year should be planned in advance. We read in the newspaper that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau submitted a document to the mayor proposing that from the 20th year, the accounting year for national industry and commerce be changed to from March 1 of this year to the end of February of the following year. The first closing and submission period each year is the end of June, the second is the end of October, and the third final closing period is the end of February of the following year. This is really suitable for both government orders and commercial sentiment. It is proposed to separately send telegrams to the municipal government and the Executive Yuan to express approval. Therefore, we sent letters to various industry associations to solicit opinions, asking them to provide detailed opinions on the above-mentioned revised closing date method before March 15, so that we can handle it. The association has submitted it to the members' meeting for detailed discussion. The Qian agreed that the closing of accounts is a matter of transfer and is extremely important. If the closing period is not appropriate, the business will be affected. The total closing period of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's proposal at the end of February seems to give merchants ample time to prepare, but I don't know that the obstruction is equal to its lack of time. The income and sales of agricultural products are based on solar terms. By January, they can all be completely stored. Farmers use the proceeds as compensation for the goods in the store. All over the country, it has become a rule. If the closing of accounts is delayed until the end of February, the proceeds will often be used for other consumption after a long period of time. Then the store's collection of accounts will inevitably be difficult. The inappropriate one is that from the end of February, farmers will engage in spring farming, and merchants will be in the peak period of entering spring goods. It is the time for financial adjustment, but it is the period for collection and termination. The inappropriate one is that the Qian industry is customary to start business after the total relief and after going through sorting and investigation procedures. The shortest time for sorting and investigation also takes half a month. If the total closing period is the end of February, then the Qian industry will grant relief after mid-March, which will inevitably affect the progress of various industries. The inappropriate one is three. In summary, the Qian agreed that the total closing period at the end of February is difficult to implement. After repeated consideration, it is proposed that the total closing period at the end of January is more suitable. At this time, both agricultural products and commercial goods can be terminated. There is no inconvenience as mentioned above, and it also implicitly conforms to the proposal to have the day before the beginning of spring as the total closing and submission date. The whole body unanimously agreed that it is the most suitable and feasible. The case is especially the opinion of the association is hereby conveyed in a letter. Please carefully consider the business situation and adopt it. I am extremely grateful. This reply is to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>A major reform</p>
<h3 id="e116">Vehicle Timetable on Both Lines <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Using new locomotives, shorten travel time, change stops for the convenience of passengers between Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>(A) Special Express Trains</p>
<p>(1) The eleventh upward special express train in the morning, due to the use of Pacific-type new locomotives, has increased speed and shortened travel time. Therefore, the departure time from Shanghai North Station is planned to change to 9:30 AM and arrive in Beijing at 4:24 PM.</p>
<p>(2) The nineteenth upward combined transport special express train in the afternoon will also use Pacific-type locomotives to shorten travel time. Therefore, the departure time can be delayed to 3:15 PM, allowing sufficient preparation after the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo combined transport train arrives at Shanghai North Station.</p>
<p>(3) The twenty-seventh upward overnight special express train, due to the use of Pacific-type new locomotives, plans to delay the departure time by 45 minutes, allowing passengers to board leisurely. The arrival time in Beijing will be 7:20 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>(4) The fourteenth downward special express train in the morning, because Xiaguan Station is far from the city center, passengers in the city often feel the current departure time is too early. Also, this train has combined transport connections. If combined transport passengers cannot catch it in time, they must wait for days. Therefore, it is planned to depart from Beijing at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>(5) The twenty-fourth downward special express train in the afternoon plans to use Pacific-type locomotives to reduce travel time by 35 minutes.</p>
<p>(6) The twenty-eighth downward overnight special express train is still scheduled to depart from Beijing at 11:00 PM. Due to other train meeting schedules, it can only be advanced to arrive in Shanghai at 6:53 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>(B) Express Trains</p>
<p>(7) The seventh upward morning express train between Shanghai and Beijing is still scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 7:00 AM and arrive in Beijing at 3:50 PM.</p>
<p>(8) The departure time of the seventeenth upward afternoon express train is still appropriate, so there is no need to change it.</p>
<p>(9) The twelfth downward morning express train between Beijing and Shanghai is scheduled to depart from Beijing at 7:30 AM and arrive in Shanghai at 4:24 PM.</p>
<p>(10) The twenty-second downward afternoon express train between Beijing and Shanghai will delay the departure time by 25 minutes due to Jinpu combined transport connections.</p>
<p>(C) Slow Trains</p>
<p>(10)(1) The current thirteenth upward third and fourth class slow train between Beijing and Shanghai is delayed mainly because the dwell time at each station is too long. Each time it stops and the travel time between two stations is extremely tight. If the locomotive is damaged or the stations are crowded with passengers, it is easy to be delayed. Therefore, it often has to give way to the later afternoon express trains and special express trains, etc., so the delay upon arrival in Beijing is often three to four hours or more. Now it is planned to advance the departure of this train to 5:30 AM from Shanghai and arrive in Beijing at 2:53 PM. In the Shanghai-Wuxi section, it will only stop at the usual first and second class major stations. Above Wuxi, it will still stop at each station. In this way, the train can save stop time and avoid the delay of yielding to other trains midway. The passengers on this train mostly arrive at the station very early, so advancing the departure time is quite suitable for passenger needs, and long-distance passengers who arrive at the station early can also transfer to their destinations leisurely.</p>
<p>(10)(2) Currently, all problem trains in each district are equipped with first and second class seats to meet the needs of passengers. However, when passengers want to go to a station beyond the section of the train's route, or the express trains with first and second class seats do not stop at the station they want to go to, they often jointly write to request stops by express trains or special express trains, and so on. Therefore, it is planned to add a first, second, and third class Shanghai-Beijing slow train at 10:00 AM to remedy the above difficulties. Passengers traveling to and from small stations along the way who cannot catch the Shanghai-Beijing third and fourth class slow train or the third and fourth class trains do not stop at each station can take the first, second, and third class slow train. Generally, those who want to travel in first and second class can also avoid the regret of being unable to.</p>
<p>(10)(3) The reasons for the delay of the twentieth downward third and fourth class slow train between Beijing and Shanghai are the same as the thirteenth upward third and fourth class slow train mentioned above. Therefore, it is also planned to advance the departure to 8:00 AM from Beijing and stipulate that it yields to the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou combined transport special express train at Lingkou to avoid further unexpected delays. Long-distance third and fourth class passengers can also avoid arriving in Shanghai late at night. In the Wuxi-Shanghai North section, except for Suzhou, Kunshan, Anting, and Nanxiang stations, all other stations will not stop to save time and avoid delays.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>However, for the convenience of passengers, it is planned to add a Shanghai-Wuxi third and fourth class local train, which arrives at Shanghai North Station 47 minutes earlier than the Beijing-Shanghai third and fourth class train. Therefore, most passengers in this section will be happy to take the local train to avoid the congestion of the twentieth third and fourth class slow train.</p>
<p>(10)(4) A first, second, and third class Beijing-Shanghai slow train is added at 10:25 AM. The reason is the same as the twelfth.</p>
<p>(D) Local Trains</p>
<p>(15) The above-mentioned Shanghai-Beijing third and fourth class trains only stop at first and second class major stations in the Shanghai-Changzhou section in order to reduce the stopping time of the train. However, there are many passengers in this section, so it is planned to run a Shanghai-Wuxi third and fourth class local train at 7:30 AM. On the one hand, it is convenient for passengers in this section, and on the other hand, it avoids the congestion of the Shanghai-Beijing third and fourth class train.</p>
<p>(16) The current twenty-first Shanghai-Changzhou local train is delayed by 30 minutes because the combined transport special express train has changed its departure.</p>
<p>(17) There is no need to revise the schedule of the current twenty-fifth Shanghai-Changzhou local train.</p>
<p>(18) According to the current timetable, there are two Shanghai-Wuxi local trains in the afternoon, which seems to be sufficient for the needs of passengers, and the fifteenth Shanghai-Kunshan local train has few passengers. It is now planned to advance the twenty-third Shanghai-Wuxi local train to depart at 11:30 AM to remedy the low passenger count of the eleventh train and extend the route to increase railway revenue. When the tenth train is canceled, a Dan-Shanghai local train should be opened to replace it.</p>
<p>(19) The schedule of the Wuxi-Nanjing local train is quite suitable for passengers traveling to and from stations such as Hanzhen and Danyang, so there is no need to modify it.</p>
<p>(20) The number of passengers on the current twelfth morning express train increases sharply in the Danyang-Changzhou section, so passengers west of Changzhou have no seats. To improve this situation, it is planned to use the Shanghai-Changzhou local train to run to Danyang the next day as a Changzhou-Danyang local train, and then run the train as a Dan-Shanghai local train before the Beijing-Shanghai morning express train to avoid congestion on the morning express train.</p>
<p>(21) The current Anting-Shanghai local train has few passengers at Anting and Huangdu stations, so it is planned to change it to a Shanghai-Shanghai local train to avoid low ridership. Because the distance between Shanghai North and Nanxiang is short, it is planned to transfer steam locomotives from the Shanghai-Shanghai line to save costs.</p>
<p>(22) The schedule of the Nanjing-Qianjiang local train is still suitable and no changes are planned.</p>
<p>(23) The downward Shanghai-Wuxi third and fourth class local train is for carrying passengers between Shanghai and Wuxi and to remedy the congestion of the Beijing-Shanghai third and fourth class train in the Shanghai-Wuxi section.</p>
<p>(24) The Dan-Shanghai local train is to avoid the congestion of the Beijing-Shanghai morning express train and to replace the canceled tenth Kunshan-Shanghai local train.</p>
<p>(25) There is no need to modify the schedule of the Changzhou-Shanghai and Shanghai-Wuxi South local trains.</p>
<p>(26) Most of the passengers on the current eighteenth Changzhou-Shanghai local train are absorbed by the sixteenth Shanghai-Wuxi local train, and the number of passengers in the Changzhou-Wuxi section not served by the sixteenth train is small. Therefore, the eighteenth train is almost redundant. It is planned to discontinue its operation to avoid low ridership.

<h3 id="e117">Revised Timetable for Shanghai-Shanghai Trains <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Implemented since yesterday. After the Shanghai-Shanghai Railway started running steam locomotives last year, there were 74 upward and downward trains every day, departing every 20 minutes. Passengers praised it for its convenience. Later, due to frequent locomotive breakdowns midway, there were many delays, and passengers complained. Recently, the railway bureau, in order to rectify the situation, re-stipulated the timetable for the upward and downward trains on the line. The original 74 Shanghai-Shanghai upward and downward trains have now been changed to 40, a reduction of 34. However, 40 local trains have been added from Shanghai Station to Jiangwan, which officially started yesterday. Because the number of trains between Shanghai and Shanghai has been reduced by almost half, the passengers on each upward and downward train were extremely crowded yesterday. There was no room to stand in the carriages, and passengers were dangerously hanging on the steps of the carriages. The situation was extremely dangerous. Although the railway bureau staff advised them, they did not pay attention, and passengers continued to arrive, all waiting for the next train because they could not board. The order was quite chaotic. The revised timetable is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Shanghai Downward Train Timetable (Departing from Shanghai): 6:10, 7:00, 7:50, 8:45, 9:30, 10:20, 11:15, 12:05, 12:50, 13:45, 14:30, 15:25, 16:25, 17:15, 18:15, 19:05, 19:50, 20:45, 21:40, 22:25</p>
<p>Upward Train Timetable (Departing from Paotaiwan): 7:00, 7:45, 8:40, 9:25, 10:12, 11:15, 12:00, 12:45, 13:35, 14:30, 15:25, 16:25, 17:15, 18:10, 19:00, 19:50, 20:40, 21:30, 22:25, 23:15</p>
<p>Jiangwan Local Train (Departing from Shanghai): 6:30, 7:25, 8:15, 9:10, 9:50, 10:45, 11:40, 12:30, 13:15, 14:05, 14:55, 15:50, 16:50, 17:45, 18:35, 19:25, 20:15, 21:05, 22:00, 22:45, 23:35 Jiangwan Departure 6:55, 7:45, 8:40, 9:28, 10:18, 11:15, 12:02, 12:48, 13:43, 14:30, 15:25, 16:25, 17:12, 18:10, 19:00, 19:50, 20:40, 21:38, 22:20, 23:15, 23:50</p>
<p>Guo Jingluan Goes to Jinan</p>
<h3 id="e118">Investigate the Remains of Martyr Cai Gongshi <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Request the Central Government to order the Shandong Provincial Government to assist in the investigation of the remains of martyr Cai Gongshi, who died in the May 3rd Massacre at the Jinan Diplomatic Office. It is unknown where the Japanese abandoned his remains. Because the Jinan Case has not been resolved, there is no way to investigate. After the Shandong Provincial Party Department exposed that the house owner Zhang Shuheng secretly rented the martyrdom site to the Japanese in an attempt to cover up the May 3rd Massacre, Mrs. Cai Gongshi, Guo Jingluan, repeatedly requested the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Shandong Provincial Government to investigate and find the remains separately. The details of the process have been recorded in previous reports. It was heard that Mrs. Cai originally planned to go to Jinan as soon as possible, but was unable to start due to illness. Recently, her condition has improved slightly. The Gongshi School, named in memory of martyr Cai, has also moved to new school buildings and started classes. Therefore, yesterday, she went to Nanjing to ask the Central Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions and set off for Jinan on the same day. The memorial to the National Government is recorded as follows: "Presenting the case of recovering from illness and going to Jinan to find the remains of martyr Cai Gongshi, humbly requesting the Shandong Provincial Government to grant assistance. I, Jingluan, lost my husband, martyr Cai Gongshi, in the May 3rd Massacre, and his remains in Jinan have not been found. The martyrdom site was rented to the Japanese by the house owner Zhang Shuheng. I requested the Shandong Provincial Government to confiscate the land and find the remains to appease the loyal soul. The case was handled by your government and the Executive Yuan, and the reply from the Shandong Provincial Government has been received recently, and I am notified by the Civil Affairs Office of your government. I am extremely grateful and moved. Although Jingluan has been unable to go to Jinan for a long time due to illness, she has secretly instructed Han Chunru, the father of Han Shuzhen, the secretary of the diplomatic office who died at the same time as martyr Cai, to go to investigate. The main points of his report are that the burial site of martyr Cai and others is roughly the same as that reported by the Jinan Public Security Bureau of Shandong Province, but in more detail. The martyrdom site is still piled with cotton, allowing mules and horses to enter and trample on it. According to his investigation, the martyrdom site did have the signboard of the Japanese Hua Kang Foreign Firm, and it was only changed to Da Zhong Hua Zhan after the Party Department exposed it. The Shandong Provincial Government's reply lists methods that focus on Jingluan and former comrades of martyr Cai who know the special features of martyr Cai's clothing and appearance to provide detailed descriptions before trying to find and bury them. Now, Jingluan's sick body has recovered slightly, and the tragic image of my deceased husband's martyrdom for the country breaks my heart. I have decided to personally go to Jinan to find the remains. Not only does my deceased husband have special markings on his teeth, but his decayed clothing can also be identified. (Omission) I urgently report to your government for review. However, Jingluan is an ordinary weak woman, and Jinan is a place where she has never set foot. I am very afraid that my knowledge and ability are weak and I cannot investigate. However, I think that my deceased husband died for the country in a diplomatic incident. I dare to humbly implore your government to grant permission to order the Shandong Provincial Government to instruct the Jinan Public Security Bureau to provide practical and effective assistance at any time and to seal off the martyrdom site so that the grave can be excavated to find the remains. As for the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Licheng County Party Department's proposal to rebuild the Martyr's Shrine at the site, the Shandong Provincial Government's reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that the shrine should be built to show the great integrity and encourage future generations. The special shrine for praising loyalty and martyrdom should be ordered by the National Government to facilitate preparations and show seriousness. I also ask your government to quickly approve the implementation. I will report to your government on the situation in Jinan at any time for your inspection and guidance. With tears in my eyes, I submit this petition, unable to restrain my impatience and awaiting orders. Respectfully presented to the Chairman of the National Government, Jiang Gongshi. Cai Guo Jingluan, Principal of Zhong School</p>

<p>Whether they will travel today still depends on the weather. French aviators Maineux and Bellonte set off from Paris on the 2nd of this month in a Farman monoplane for a long-distance flight from Paris to Tokyo. They flew to Hong Kong the day before yesterday and were originally scheduled to fly directly to Shanghai from Hong Kong at 7:00 AM yesterday, expecting to arrive yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. However, the weather in the south has not improved, and the dense fog surrounding Hong Kong has not dissipated, so the two aviators decided to postpone their flight to Shanghai. However, the various sectors of the city did not know the truth and still went to Hongqiao Airport to welcome them. Later, the French Consul General notified the aircraft factory director Shen Dexie by telephone that the aviators had postponed their arrival in Shanghai, and they all returned disappointed. Whether the aviators will be able to arrive in Shanghai today still depends on the weather.</p>

<p>Planning the Chinese Exposition. Shanghai Electric Communications Agency News. Mr. Kawase Sohei, President of the Eastern Academy, came to Shanghai this time to plan a Chinese Exposition to be held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo for two months from July 10th to September 10th this year to introduce emerging China to the general public. He is currently traveling to various places. Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun also expressed his support and plans to exhibit the planned Grand Shanghai model and many useful materials. A memorial service for Sun Yat-sen will be held in the hall on the opening day of the exhibition, with portraits of revolutionary martyrs hung in the center. From the entrance, there will be a panoramic construction plan model of Grand Shanghai, models of Nanjing government offices, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, and various places from Shanghai to Chongqing, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, Qufu, Tianjin, Beiping, etc. There will also be an exhibition of Chinese national products, with the development of emerging China introduced to the Japanese public through physical objects. Mr. Ase is scheduled to go to the capital tonight to collect materials from various places.</p>

<p>In the area of Min'guo Road in the French Concession, vegetable vendors have been setting up stalls for business. However, the stalls set up by the vendors did not comply with the police rules, so the French police strictly banned the stalls on the section of Xinqiao Street a few days ago in order to maintain traffic. However, the vegetable vendors' livelihoods were concerned. After being banned, they reported to the French Concession Street Vendors Association to request maintenance. After the association submitted a request to the French authorities for accommodation, the French authorities agreed to understand and sent personnel to the area a few days ago to investigate and advise the vendors to set up stalls for sale in accordance with the regulations. The vendors immediately complied one by one and have reportedly resumed business as usual.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Support Association</p>
<h3 id="e122">Request Further Negotiations on the Dutch Tax Increase Case <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Strive to achieve the goal of withdrawing the original plan. The China-Dutch Diplomatic Support Association believes that the Dutch increase in immigration tax of 150 guilders per person will cause China to lose 20 million yuan annually, and the impact is beyond calculation. Therefore, yesterday, it sent telegrams to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Acting Agent Dai stationed in the Netherlands requesting continued negotiations. The telegram texts are recorded as follows: (A) Telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: We have investigated the case of the Dutch colonial council's decision to increase the immigration tax to 150 guilders per person. Overseas Chinese groups and enthusiastic overseas Chinese have repeatedly called for negotiations. Fortunately, your ministry adopted the protest of the Acting Agent Dai stationed in the Netherlands, which has been repeatedly postponed. However, the association believes that if this case is not fundamentally revoked, the ashes will eventually rekindle. Therefore, on February 8th, it sent a telegram requesting continued negotiations, but there was no late indication of profoundness. I originally wanted to "shut up" to avoid offending the public. However, bad news came and the situation changed again. The Dutch government saw that our government no longer protested, the public no longer opposed the Dutch, Dutch ships were sailing as usual, and Dutch sugar was still being transported to China. Since diplomacy was no longer worried, the tax increase would be implemented, and they would even make further progress and set other penalties of hundreds of guilders. Your ministry's efforts are in vain, and the people will suffer. The association is sincerely grieved and humbly requests your ministry to uphold the spirit of loving overseas Chinese and take a firm attitude to send telegrams to all parties to continue protesting. The protest will not end until the case is revoked to maintain the survival of all overseas Chinese in the Netherlands, recover the annual loss of 20 million yuan, and bring honor to the party and the country and benefit the people. The association has no selfish interests. Finally, I humbly request you to accept my final plea. China-Dutch Diplomatic Support Association (B) Telegram to Agent Dai in The Hague, Chinese Embassy in The Hague, Agent Dai: I have repeatedly read the documents of your protest against the Dutch increase in immigration tax. Your words are reasonable and your admiration is inexplicable. However, the Dutch only know the interests and do not ask right and wrong. At first, they used our public protest in front and the national assistance behind to ease our people's anger, so they suspended the case to wait for the time. Unexpectedly, bad news came from afar that the implementation was imminent. For example, building a mountain without completing it is a heartfelt pain for overseas Chinese and the country. I humbly request that you continue to negotiate to achieve the goal of revoking the case, open a new era in Sino-Dutch diplomacy, and be the true savior of overseas Chinese in the Netherlands. Not only will the association praise you. China-Dutch Diplomatic Support Association</p>
<h3 id="e123">Various Industries Request Reduction of Business Tax <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Construction Industry Association previously convened various colleagues to solicit opinions on the business tax matter. It was agreed that the special circumstances of the industry, such as material substitution and labor substitution, as well as the losses due to rising material prices in recent years, should be detailed in a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for submission to the government for verification and reduction to achieve the lowest tax amount to ease the burden.</p>
<p>The West Clothing Industry Association Chairman and Committee Member Wang Lianfang yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Industry Association Tax Regulations Research Committee stating, "Regarding the city's business tax, which is currently being studied and will be implemented soon, various industries have expressed their opinions to form good tax laws. Regarding the situation of our industry, we should contribute our views and hope for your consideration. The provisions of Article 4 of the Outline of Business Tax Collection in various provinces stipulate that luxury businesses and other businesses that should be banned should not exceed 2 per mille. This point is the most accurate standard for determining the tax rate. Those that are not luxury businesses and are not in the list of businesses that should be banned are taxed below 2 per mille to comply with the central regulations. Our Western clothing industry is the first of the four necessities of people's livelihood, and its name is not a luxury business. Its raw materials are mainly silk, cotton, hemp, wool fabrics, and woolens. In recent years, many domestic products have been invented, and their prices are several times lower than those of foreign silk and satin. Since silk and satin are not luxury businesses and are taxed at 2 per mille, the raw materials of Western clothing have no luxury business nature. As for the finished clothes, such as Zhongshan cloth and Liberty cloth, the price of each set of domestic Western clothing is only four or five yuan. If the robes and jackets of the used clothing industry are made of foreign goods or silk and satin, their prices are more expensive than Western clothing by dozens of times. This shows that the finished goods are also not luxury businesses. In particular, the form of Western clothing is stipulated in Article 4 of the National Government Clothing System Regulations, so Western clothing is not in the list of luxury businesses. It can be seen that the tax rate of 20 per mille for the Western clothing industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces exceeds the central regulations. This is one point. In terms of banning, strange clothes and exotic clothes should be banned, and the form of Western clothing has been adopted by the National Government Clothing System Regulations, which is the same as the used clothing system and is a national custom clothing. However, the tax rate for the used clothing industry is 2 per mille, so why is the tax rate for the Western clothing industry 20 per mille? The same national custom clothing is manufactured by the same Chinese people and is the same manual industry. The tax rate is ten times different, which is not in line with the outline's regulations. This is the second point. According to the provisions of Article 7 of the Supplementary Measures, all kinds of businesses, regardless of whether they are engaged in local goods or foreign goods, are taxed at the same tax rate. Therefore, the Western clothing industry and the used clothing industry, regardless of whether they are manufactured for local goods or foreign goods, should be taxed together and should not be differentiated. This is the third point. Based on the three points listed above, the Western clothing industry is neither a luxury business nor should it be banned. It should comply with the regulations and be taxed below 2 per mille. Correspondingly, I request your association to forward it to the authorities so that the tax rate for the Western clothing industry is no higher than 2 per mille to show fairness and maintain the people's livelihood. I hope you will reply to my greetings."</p>
<p>Rickshaw Industry Association</p>
<h3 id="e124">Advocates No Further Issuance of Vehicle Numbers <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Rickshaw Industry Association wrote a letter stating that since the Public Works Bureau reorganized the rickshaws in the Chinese Concession in the Republic of China in 1928, the number of vehicles in Shanghai South has been reduced from 5,064 to 4,500, and the number of vehicles in Zhabei has been reduced from 3,472 to 2,900. The North-South Vehicle Dealers Association is responsible for paying the guaranteed donation. For the past three years, the municipal government's 176th municipal meeting on the 27th of last month had a case of increasing the number of rickshaws. This quota guarantee donation system will be changed. The Shanghai Municipal Rickshaw Industry Association submitted the case to the four bureau chiefs of the Public Works Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the Secretary-General for review and then reported to the meeting for a decision. They separately stated the reasons to the reviewers and requested careful deliberation, which can be divided into three points: (1) The number of vehicles should be determined based on market demand. The number of trams and public buses in the city is gradually increasing, and the rickshaw industry has been eliminated invisibly. From the actual situation, the original 7,400 vehicles should be appropriately reduced to meet the intention of promoting transportation. If the number of vehicle dealers is increased indiscriminately, the vehicle dealers will not be able to maintain their business and will inevitably affect the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers. I always remember the tragic events of the Hangzhou rickshaw puller riot on March 28, 1929, and the Beijing rickshaw puller riot on October 23. Although there is no lack of disruptive colors in this, the active promotion of public buses in Hangzhou, which seized the business of rickshaw pullers (a total of 1,000 rickshaws), and the excess of 30,000 rickshaws in Beijing were the main causes of the case. As a result, social security was affected, and rickshaw pullers suffered repeatedly. For the sake of humanity and for the sake of municipal administration, please deliberate carefully. This is one point. (2) Recently, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce followed the central government's orders to request the provincial and municipal governments to stipulate the maximum rental amount for rickshaws to prevent monopoly. If the quota guarantee donation system is not prevented, a monopoly will be inevitable. Only the practice of raising prices can be banned according to law, and those who are now requesting to increase the number of vehicles are not motivated by helping rickshaw pullers, but by speculative vehicle dealers who want to speculate and profit from it. The rickshaw pullers have no benefits at all. It is to sacrifice the interests of the majority for the desires of a few speculators. Please deliberate carefully. This is the second point. (3) The quota guarantee donation system for 10,000 rickshaws in the Public Concession has been in place for eight years. The price of the vehicles is several times higher than that in the Chinese Concession, and the income is less than one-third. The vehicles are being stranded every day, and there are more vehicles than drivers in spring and summer, which cannot be compensated. This is because the Public Concession has not yet been recovered, and rickshaws managed by foreigners are allowed to travel freely throughout the city. Our Chinese Concession is unreasonably restricted and cannot even provide relief. If the British note is reduced and this is increased, then the larger will be larger and the smaller will be smaller. Is it possible to plan for the gang fight? Please deliberate carefully. This is the third point.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Yesterday's Fire Incidents Recorded <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>At around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 68-70, Hu Min Nan Zha Road, Nanshi, downstairs of the Zhengxing Xuji Button Factory. At the time, all the workers of the factory were lodging upstairs, and everyone was in a sweet dream, completely unaware. Fortunately, Jiang Xijie, a police officer at Post No. 33 of the Second District General Office, discovered it and immediately sounded a frantic alarm while also telephoning the fire brigade. In an instant, the fire had spread. By the time the firefighters arrived in their vehicles, it had already spread to part of the adjacent No. 66, the Liyong Machinery Factory. It took about an hour of spraying water to extinguish the fire. Subsequently, Gao Hongshu, a patrol leader from the Chezhan Road Police Station of the Second District General Office, along with several long-term police officers, arrived at the scene to maintain order. The factory owner's wife, Zhang Wu, a native of Anhui (age 40), and the foreman, Ni Meisheng, were detained and sent to the Second District General Office. According to Wu, the fire started in the motor room downstairs, probably due to an electrical short circuit. Although there was fire insurance of 4,000 taels, it was not certain whether the insurance policy had been taken out. According to the confession, Director Wang prepared a document to be transferred to the General Bureau for verification. At 8:46 PM last night, a transformer box of the French Tram Company in Lujiawan suddenly caught fire. In an instant, the fire spread, and the sound of explosions shook the vicinity. The Great Bell and Songshan Road fire brigades were alerted and rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. However, all the electrical equipment inside was reduced to ashes. The losses were minor. At 11:34 AM yesterday morning, in front of the Samsung Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road, two employees of a certain liquor store were pulling a cart that passed by. The cart was carrying four large baskets of Niuzhuang sorghum liquor. One of the employees accidentally dropped a burning incense stick into the liquor basket, and a fire suddenly started. The Yangshupu Fire Brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire. However, sorghum liquor is extremely flammable, making it difficult to extinguish. The fire was not extinguished until after 12:00 PM. Yellow sand and other materials were used to put out the fire. However, all four baskets of liquor were burned, resulting in a loss of about 600 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Xue Die Contract Termination Case <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Attempting Reconciliation</p>
<p>Through the Lawyers of Both Parties</p>
<p>Lin Claims Deep Regret and Eagerness to Reconcile</p>
<p>Hu Claims Empty Words are Useless, Treats Engagement Like Child's Play</p>
<p>Their Opinions are Very Far Apart</p>
<p>Last winter, Hu Die, a female actress of the Mingxing Film Company, received a letter from her fiancé, Lin Xuehuai, suddenly entrusting lawyer E Sen to propose the termination of their engagement. Hu, indignant at Lin's cold alliance, hired lawyer Zhan Ji to sue Lin, demanding compensation for loss of reputation and various debts. Lin also hired lawyers E Sen and Ni Zheng'ao to defend and filed a counterclaim demanding the return of the betrothal gifts, a gold bird ring. Later, Lin Xuehuai voluntarily proposed an agreement to terminate the contract and withdraw the lawsuit. However, the proposal failed to materialize due to the failure to reach an agreement. Therefore, at 9:00 AM on the 28th of last month, Zhou Renda, a judge of the Special Zone District Court, conducted the first hearing and ordered both parties to try reconciliation outside the court. If reconciliation failed, the hearing was scheduled to resume on the 20th of this month. These details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that Lin is very supportive of the reconciliation proposal, but Hu, because Lin's love is fickle and she fears it would be difficult to grow old together, is reluctant to fulfill the engagement. Therefore, although Lin recently entrusted lawyers E Ni to send a letter to Hu Die's representative lawyer Zhan Jifeng requesting the abandonment of previous grievances and the repair of old friendships, Zhan's reply stated that Hu required Lin to confess to the world the fabricated facts of trying to evade debts and misappropriating cars in order to seek the understanding of the world before an agreement could be reached. From this perspective, both parties are attempting to reconcile, but their opinions are very far apart. This proposal is feared to be unsuccessful, and the case will still have to be judged according to the law. The original letters of the two parties are listed below: Dear Sirs, Regarding the case of the termination of the contract between Lin and Hu, Judge Zhou of the Special Court has ordered a trial reconciliation. According to my client, Lin Xuehuai, I have never lessened my love for Ms. Hu Die from beginning to end. Because Ms. Hu's words were decisive in breaking up and asking people to dissolve the marriage contract, I wrote a letter on November 28 in a fit of anger. Now I deeply regret my recklessness and am eager to follow Judge Zhou's advice to reconcile with Ms. Hu and prove our previous alliance. Please convey my intentions to the opposing lawyer on behalf of my esteemed lawyers and ask for Ms. Hu's consent. Accordingly, I am sending you this letter and hope that your esteemed lawyers will earnestly enlighten your client with the aim of settling the matter so that this marriage contract can still be maintained. Yours sincerely, Lawyers E Sen Ni Zheng'ao, March 10, 20th year. Dear Sirs, I received your letter of the 10th of this month from your esteemed lawyers E Sen Ni Zheng'ao representing Lin Xuehuai to Ms. Hu Die requesting reconciliation and maintenance of the marriage contract, and then submitted it to Ms. Hu for review. According to the statement, the clause in the letter stating that "Die first decisively broke up and asked people to dissolve the marriage contract" is entirely a fabricated fact. The facts are there, and empty words are useless. The good intentions of Judge Zhou's persuasion for reconciliation should be respected. However, Judge Zhou's original intention in advising reconciliation was definitely not to advise temporary reconciliation, but to seek a harmonious and permanent marriage and resolve disputes thoroughly in order to achieve the purpose of reconciliation. If this purpose is to be achieved, it is necessary for both parties to be honest in their words and deeds and to have high moral character. If a person borrows money and tries to evade it, misappropriates money, fabricates rumors in anger, repeatedly seeks to terminate the contract, and suddenly rejoices and regrets their recklessness, begging to continue the old alliance, disregarding shame and treating the engagement as child's play, how can one ask what kind of happiness and results the couple will have in the future if they marry someone with such words, deeds, and character? Die is not smart, so please teach me how to deal with it. In Die's opinion, if Mr. Lin is being judged by his conscience and has made up his mind to repent, he should immediately inform society and confess the situation of fabricating facts, trying to evade debts, and misappropriating cars in order to seek the understanding of the world. In the minds of the general public, some people may criticize Mr. Lin for his moral bankruptcy. However, retreating one step is still better than those who persist in doing evil. If he does not plan to do this and only makes excuses and thinks of going back and forth, let alone speaking of reconciliation, I am afraid that the situation and the law will not allow it. Ms. Hu has entrusted me with the task of replying. I believe that the words of my client are sincere and without any falsehood. Please earnestly advise your client, Mr. Lin Xuehuai, to quickly confess the facts of whitewashing and covering up mistakes in accordance with Ms. Hu's advice in order to quell Ms. Hu's anger. At that time, I may take the opportunity to speak. I am sending you this reply and hope that you will take it into consideration and forward it to me. Sincerely, Lawyers Zhan Jifeng, Republic of China, March 14, 20th year.</p>

<p>Caught Red-Handed on the Spot</p>
<p>Yin Xueqin, a waiter at the Bai'e Dance Hall on North Sichuan White Paul Road, took five silver dollars to the Beiwanfeng Tobacco Paper Store at around 5:30 AM yesterday to exchange them for 55 cents in small foreign coins and 36 copper coins. When he arrived at the entrance of Dade Alley, a Frenchman suddenly stepped forward, pulled out a pistol from his sleeve, and threatened him to keep silent, completely robbing him of all the small foreign coins. Yin then shouted "Catch the robber!" The police officer No. 4 of the First Division of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau heard the call and stepped forward to take the Frenchman to the police station. According to the defendant, his name was Xie Ye, a Frenchman, 25 years old, living at No. 18 Kunshan Garden, and doing electric light business at No. 6 Er Ma Road. He denied the robbery. Then, in his bag, 55 cents in stolen foreign coins, a fake pistol, and a pair of pliers were found.

<p>Stone Lime Kiln Collapse</p>
<h3 id="e139">Crushing a Young Worker to Death <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>One Death and Three Injuries In the Tonghe Yong Stone Lime Kiln in Xiaoshadu Stone Lime Kiln, Shanghai West, business has been fairly good in recent years. However, the kiln has been in disrepair for years and is in a state of disrepair. At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the kiln was burning lime, and seven or eight workers were working beside the kiln when a wall of the kiln suddenly collapsed. Although the workers immediately ran to avoid it, a worker named Yang Defu was unable to escape and was crushed inside, dying instantly. Three other workers suffered minor injuries to their hands and feet. Fortunately, none were life-threatening. When the factory staff heard the sound and knew that something bad had happened, they rushed to the rescue, but it was too late. Yang Chen, the wife of the deceased, was extremely saddened by the tragic death of her husband and immediately filed a complaint with the Sixth District Police Station. The police were dispatched to bring the factory staff member Hu Yunfang to the case. District Chief Ren questioned Yang Chen, who stated that she was 30 years old, from Baoying, and currently lived in a shack in the stone lime kiln area. Her husband, Yang Defu, was 32 years old and had been working as a worker in the factory for several months. There were several children in the family, all of whom depended on her husband to make a living. Now, because the kiln was in disrepair for many years, her husband was tragically killed, and their future livelihood was insecure. She requested justice. According to Hu Yunfang, 28 years old, from Shaoxing, who worked as a staff member in the kiln, it was true that the worker Yang Defu was crushed to death by the collapsed kiln. After District Chief Ren obtained the confession, he believed that the case involved injury and death and should be prepared in writing and transferred to the District Court for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Forensic Examination Confirms <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Xie Changhai and Zhou Cailiang</p>
<p>Both Had Significant Relationships</p>
<p>Zhou Jindi, a 28-year-old woman from Danyang, lived in the Yufeng Yarn Factory's workshop on Pingliang Road. On January 30th of this year, at 7:00 PM, when she went to the factory to work the night shift, she was lured away and drugged, resulting in rape. She also lost a gold ring and a wool sweater. Shen Yuzhou, a Chinese detective of the Yangshupu Police Station, arrested Xie Changhai, a Jiangbei man, and sent him to the Special Zone District Court for questioning. Zhou Jindi, the victim, suddenly changed her behavior after being frightened and could not speak. The court ordered a forensic examination to determine whether she was a virgin and what disease she was suffering from for further verification. Shen, the detective in charge of the case, subsequently arrested Liu Peide, a suspect from Shandong Province, and sent him to the Third Criminal Division of the Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Xiao Xiefen took the seat to hear the case. The police lawyer stated the case, and the plaintiff, Zhou Jindi, stated that she had gone to the factory to work that night and forgot to bring her food basket. On the way back, she met the defendant Xie Changhai and Zhou Cailiang, who was at large, who lured her to a certain place and slept with Xie and Zhou for two nights. On the third night, she slept with Zhou, and Xie took the gold ring and sweater she was wearing. While speaking, she also cursed angrily but did not recognize Liu Peide. Zhang Hongcai, Zhou's grandfather, stated that Liu Peide was not involved. The defendant Xie Changhai was questioned and denied the abduction and rape, saying that he and Zhou Cailiang helped to look for her after she disappeared. He hesitated in his answer. Liu Peide stated that after Zhang Hongcai lost his daughter, he negotiated with Xie Changhai, Zhou Cailiang, and a certain Xing, and Zhou asked him to mediate, willing to pay 60 yuan to compensate for the loss of property. Because Zhang refused, the matter was dropped. He knew nothing about the abduction and asked for a review. The police lawyer stated that the court should issue the forensic examination report on Zhou Jindi. Judge Xiao approved it and ordered a postponement of fourteen days until Zhou Jindi's mind was completely clear for further verification. The defendant Xie Changhai was remanded to custody, and Liu Peide was released on bail. The forensic examination report is listed below:</p>
<p>Requesting the examination of Zhou Jindi, female, 16 years old, yarn factory worker. The symptoms of the victim are as follows: (1) The hymen has no trace, only scars remain. It has been about four weeks since the internal and external vaginal areas were eroded. (2) The patient is mentally unclear. Based on the symptoms, she was strongly threatened and suffered severe fright and stimulation, resulting in this phenomenon. As for whether she was drugged, it cannot be proven because the time has passed for so long and the drug's effect has mostly disappeared. (3) It is presumed that the victim has indeed lost her virginity, but not recently. It is difficult to determine whether her mental state can return to normal because her nature is unknown.

<p>Losses Still Minor, Warehouse Undamaged The carelessness of the Jinliyuan Warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau in the Xin Kaihe area at around 2:00 AM yesterday has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the lower floor of Warehouse H8 contained more than 200 pieces of tobacco leaves, dozens of pieces of foreign cloth, hundreds of pieces of miscellaneous grains, and several boxes of white fungus. When the incident occurred, a patrolman of the warehouse first saw smoke coming out of the iron window of Warehouse No. 8 on the Limalu Road, assuming that there were children hiding inside when the warehouse door was closed and playing with fire. He pried open the window to investigate and saw that the room was full of smoke, realizing that something was wrong. He urgently blew the whistle. Fortunately, the fire brigade was nearby and immediately drove to the scene. First, he tried to go to the disaster relief room to get the key to open the warehouse door. However, the key manager was out, so the firefighters used an axe to chop open the iron window and first sprayed medicine water in, then pumped water to extinguish the fire, which was put out at 4:00 AM. Then, the burned tobacco leaves and foreign cloth were moved out. It was estimated that more than 20 pieces of tobacco leaves and more than 40 pieces of foreign cloth were destroyed. Other goods were not affected, and the building was also undamaged. However, it is feared that the goods flooded with water were not few. As for the detailed number, yesterday was Sunday and it must be checked today before the losses are known. It is said that the Hakka people themselves have fire insurance.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Tenants Resolutely Oppose Demolition <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Tenants Association Asks for Assistance from All Circles The Tongxingli houses on Edward Road opposed the demolition by the British Teli Foreign Firm, and a meeting was held to express opposition, which was recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, the landlord sent someone to build fences for the third time, which was rejected by all the tenants. However, they are deeply afraid that the landlord will still do this. The names of all the tenants were sent to the various organizations, such as the French Concession Tenants General Association, the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, and the French Chamber of Commerce, requesting assistance. The letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, The houses of Tongxingli, which our members rent, have always been rented by Dehe Foreign Firm for 40 yuan per building. Then, Teli Foreign Firm rented them, increasing the rent by 50% to date. On December 3rd of last year, Teli issued a notice stating that the houses would be renovated and that all tenants must move out by the end of January of the 20th year. Our members believe that at this time of economic depression, moving out will cause significant losses. It is also not easy to find suitable houses. Moreover, the Tongxingli houses were only built 16 years ago, and the quality of the project is extremely sound. There is no need for renovation. Moreover, not only that, but the Lao Zhenghe Dyeing Factory, which is located at the corner and rents ten houses along the road, received another lease contract for five years after receiving the notice. That is, the houses along 203 to 221 Edward Road are also in negotiations and the cancellation of the move. The same property and the same landlord have vastly different treatments for tenants, which is even more puzzling. Our members have repeatedly sent representatives and entrusted lawyer Tao Yimin and gentlemen Lu Tingjian and Wei Yanfang to sincerely plead without results. Last month, they entrusted lawyer Jin Yu to send a letter and dispatched representatives again and again to sincerely ask for the cancellation of the move. The landlord always insisted on refusing. We believe that in recent years, the commercial situation in Shanghai has been precarious, and the trend of increased rent and demolition has been heard again and again, causing heartache and distress. For this reason, the beginning and end of the rental of our members are requested to be supported by your association to uphold justice and provide assistance. Then, all the tenants of our association will be deeply grateful and look forward to it. Please also provide guidance at any time.</p>

<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding your newspaper's report today about our company's "Daji" steamship accident, specifically the part where the company's statement was relayed by your reporters, there is a slight error in the final section regarding my oral account. The original text in your newspaper states: "Generally, the families of the victims are demanding compensation from the company. However, our company believes that this unexpected disaster resulted in losses of tens of thousands of [currency unit], which is truly unfortunate. Furthermore, according to the regulations decided by the Shipping Association, any company whose ships encounter fire or other disasters on the sea is not at fault. Therefore, the requests for compensation from the victims' families should be rejected and not accepted."</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the Shipping Association has no such regulations as previously mentioned. I only stated that providing compensation would be quite difficult, as there are no such provisions in maritime law. I inquired with the Shipping Association, and they also have no such regulations. Currently, as an emergency measure, the board of directors is requesting the Jisheng Society to handle compensation, and the board of directors will send someone to assist. There was no mention of the Shipping Association making a decision or rejecting the compensation requests from the victims' families. It is likely that the reporters misunderstood during the hasty Q&amp;A session. I request that your newspaper kindly make a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Jiang Decun, Director of Data Company</p>
<p>March 15th</p>
<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper's local news item on the 11th of this month, which stated that our association member Ge Furei caused an accident while driving City Hall vehicle number 4011 near the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Gonghe Xin Road at 3:22 PM on the 10th of this month, this account is quite different from the facts. Our association has investigated and confirmed that the accident occurred because a temporary mechanical failure caused the steering mechanism to malfunction. Moreover, the road was high in the middle and low on the sides, and the vehicle was carrying many passengers. The failure of the steering mechanism caused the vehicle to tilt to the side of the road, resulting in the accident.</p>
<p>The driver left the North Station at Baoshan Road at 3:12 PM, heading towards Zhenru. The accident occurred at 3:22 PM, meaning the journey was only about one and a half miles, and the time taken was ten minutes. Therefore, the claim that Ge was speeding is inconsistent with the facts. As for Xiao Shuntai's apprentice, he is now moving freely, suffering only minor skin abrasions. The injury was caused by an iron frame and iron pier placed outside the iron shop. The apprentice was working outside the shop when the steering failed, the road was high in the middle and low on the sides, and the brakes could not stop the vehicle immediately. As a result, the vehicle veered to the side of the road, hitting and knocking him onto the iron pier, causing the injury. If the vehicle had crashed onto the steps, the apprentice would have been killed.</p>
<p>The driver has been working for the company for two years and has a good record and is very experienced, and the incident was not caused by negligence. The driver was detained by the 4th District Police Station and sent to the local court on the 13th, where he was found not guilty. Now, the employer intends to make things difficult for the driver based on your newspaper's report. Therefore, we are providing these details to request a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Workers' Union</p>
<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing regarding the article in your newspaper's local news section on the 13th of this month titled "Provincial Police Detain Flower-Clothed Persons, Causing Repercussions." This report is inconsistent with the facts, and I am making the following clarification:</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, our district's Detective Chief Zhang Zhaoxiang reported that while leading a patrol boat to inspect suspicious vessels, he found a cotton boat belonging to Lu A'gen on the Yunzao River. Upon inspection, the delivery note stated 150 bales of cotton from the Hengxing Cotton Mill, but this did not match the black "Tai" character stamped on the bales. It was claimed that the cotton was collected piecemeal by Zhang Jisheng of the Hengxing Mill in Yangjing Town, Pudong. Upon inspecting several bales, it was confirmed that they were of various types. Although it was not known where they were collected from, it was clear that this was an illicit business dealing in stolen goods.</p>
<p>Our district then ordered Lu A'gen to be interrogated. He claimed to have been hired by the Hengxing Cotton Mill to transport the cotton and knew nothing else. As the case involved the purchase of stolen goods, Zhang Jisheng had committed a criminal offense. Although Lu A'gen was only transporting the goods and was suspected of involvement, both should be dealt with by the judiciary. Our district sent Lu A'gen and a sample of the cotton to the Shanghai Local Court on the 11th for investigation.</p>
<p>This is the true course of events, and we request that you publish a correction in your esteemed newspaper.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Fourth District Division, Jiangsu Provincial River Police Team</p>
<p>March 14th</p>
<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>I have just read today's (15th) edition of your newspaper, page 16, which contains two letters from Lu Bichou, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, to Nie Lusheng, titled "Letter Requesting Strict Prevention of Fundraising Under False Pretenses." The letters stated that someone was falsely claiming to be Hu Chongji, Counselor of the Eighth Division Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army, and had fabricated a letter from Secretary-General Lu to solicit funds in Shanghai for the education of revolutionary orphans.</p>
<p>Hu Chongji is my name. Most Kuomintang comrades know my behavior. Since I began practicing law in Shanghai last winter, I have not been involved in external affairs, nor have I ever held any military position in the National Revolutionary Army. To avoid misunderstandings and protect my personal reputation, I have written to Secretary-General Lu to request a copy of the forged letter and to inquire about the identity of Hu Muzhou for the purpose of thorough investigation. I am also writing to request that you publish this letter so that the public is aware of the situation.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Hu Chongji</p>

<p>Last Week's Gold Price Plunged by 44.7 Taels</p>
<p>Last week, the gold market experienced a brutal and volatile plunge, with complex and unpredictable fluctuations. Moments of several taels or even ten taels of price swings were commonplace. At times, price fluctuations exceeding twenty taels were observed, leaving participants bewildered and directionless. This was triggered by conflicting news, causing uncertainty among traders.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the price reached a high of 746.9 taels [currency unit]. Subsequently, the market collapsed in a tumultuous manner, breaking through the 700-tael barrier. By Wednesday, the lowest price plummeted to 683.3 taels. This was attributed to the surge in both the overseas silver market and the Shanghai foreign exchange market. Although the situation seemed to ease afterward, the fluctuations remained unpredictable, with prices hovering around 700 taels.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, the price settled at 697.8 taels, representing a significant drop of 44.7 taels for the week. The difference between the highest and lowest prices reached a staggering 63.6 taels. The total number of large bars traded was 4,375. The price of silver surged by 1.375 [currency unit], largely due to HSBC extending the lending period by three tranches (totaling 0.75 [currency unit]). The daily exchange rate dropped by 0.0825 [currency unit]. The domestic market within banks was also very loose. Most Chinese gold businesses were selling forward contracts to cover their positions. The most relaxed rate offered by banks was 1 shilling and 4 pence. As for spot gold, a total of more than 28,000 bars were shipped to the United States by [Kii] Bank. It is rumored that gold shops in Shanghai still hold approximately 40,000 bars (all pledged as collateral), and that the April gold contracts are largely short positions.</p>
<p>It is worth recalling that the gold price reached over 790 taels in the middle of last month, but unexpectedly plummeted by over 100 taels since then. The future remains highly uncertain. Next Monday (the 16th) marks the rollover date, and short positions are still being purchased. Currently, the exchange rate is pushing down the price by 60-70 taels to 40-50 taels. Below is a summary of the week's events:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Increasingly Volatile Fluctuations <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Monday (the 9th): Large bars contracted by 0.25 [currency unit], the price of silver fell by 0.375 [currency unit], and the shilling contracted by half a tranche.

Afterward, the domestic exchange rate weakened, and prices dropped sharply, plummeting by 20 taels. In the afternoon, the price was only 24.5 taels [currency unit], closing at 29.8 taels [currency unit], a decrease of 12.7 taels [currency unit] compared to the previous Saturday. The total difference for the day was 22.4 taels [currency unit].</p>
<p>Tuesday: Large bars rebounded by 0.3125 [currency unit], the price of silver rose by 0.0875 [currency unit], and the shilling rebounded by extending the lending period by two tranches.

Guangbang Hengxingshengda and others tended to sell, causing a sharp drop of more than ten taels. In the afternoon, the price broke through 710 taels [currency unit] to 0.065 taels [currency unit], closing at 0.078 taels [currency unit], a further decrease of 22 taels [currency unit].

The shilling seemed strong, and banks absorbed 1.36875 [currency unit], causing the price to rise to 715.5 taels [currency unit]. Later, Dalianbang and Hengxingshengda and others sold aggressively, causing a sudden drop of over 30 taels. In the afternoon, the price plummeted to 683.3 taels [currency unit], showing a dramatic downward trend. The closing price rebounded by ten taels due to the shrinking Indian exchange rate and the entry of large players, settling at 693.5 taels [currency unit], a decrease of 14.3 taels [currency unit] from the previous day. The total fluctuation for the day was 32.2 taels [currency unit].</p>
<p>Thursday: Large bars increased by 0.1875 [currency unit], banks by 0.375 [currency unit], and the shilling initially lengthened by half a tranche, but contracted by half a tranche in the afternoon. The domestic market tightened, and demand from traders varied. The gold market opened at 605 taels [currency unit], rebounding by 11.5 taels [currency unit]. The large bar footing was still good, and the United States continued to devalue, with private telegrams reporting even lower prices, causing extreme anxiety. Later, the shilling eased, and the bank's buying price was 1 shilling and 4 pence, causing the gold price to plummet. A sharp drop of more than ten taels to 693 taels [currency unit]. After entering, the price hovered around 700 taels [currency unit]. In the afternoon, the shilling was shortened, and the Indian exchange rate was small, with large players competing to buy. Cash was being repatriated in large quantities, leading to a favorable outcome. The price soared by ten taels to 714.5 taels [currency unit]. At that time, the bank absorbed 1.3625 [currency unit]. The closing price retreated to 708 taels [currency unit], reversing the downward trend of the past three days, rebounding by 14.5 taels [currency unit].

<p>Friday: Large bars silver fell by 0.25 [currency unit], the price of silver by 0.0625 [currency unit], and the shilling was nominally flat but loosely traded. The gold market opened with a decrease of 4.5 taels [currency unit], at 703.5 taels [currency unit]. As the private telegram silver price only contracted by 0.125 [currency unit], the market sentiment was bearish, falling to 697 taels [currency unit]. Then, due to the bravery of buyers, the exchange rate rose by more than ten taels to 716.5 taels [currency unit]. At noon, the price fell to around ten taels [currency unit]. The afternoon was very turbulent, falling from 13.5 taels [currency unit] to 698.5 taels [currency unit]. The closing price broke through the 700-tael [currency unit] barrier again, at 0.015 taels [currency unit], a decrease of 6.5 taels [currency unit] from the previous day. The range from morning to evening was 19.5 taels [currency unit], reflecting the divergent buying and selling.</p>
<p>Saturday: Large bars rebounded by 0.0625 [currency unit], the price of silver increased by 0.375 [currency unit], and the shilling lengthened by half a tranche.

<p>Grains: Rice Market Sales Quiet, Stable Gate North</p>
<p>Yesterday, boats arrived continuously from the interior, and sales tended to be slow. The buying interest for Northern white rice was particularly weak, and prices tended to fall. However, sellers were reluctant to reduce prices, so transactions were reduced. The situation for Shaobo was not smooth, and the supply was scarce, but inventories were still sufficient. The overall market was flat. Lamb indica rice was scarce, and sales were normal. Higher-quality rice was stable, while medium and lower qualities saw some price declines. Du Zibu indica rice was consistently stable, but the situation was sluggish and looked weak. Baiyuan rice remained quiet and stable, with minimal trading.</p>
<p>South Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, around 20 boats arrived. Sales for each grade were normal. Xibai japonica rice was slightly tight at first, but due to clear weather and optimistic sentiment, buyers' appetite was not strong, and prices stabilized. Sales of Su Tong white rice also slowed, and the market managed to remain stable. Southern thin rice and early rice were unpopular, and prices were soft. Lamb indica rice sales were acceptable, with higher-quality rice rising and ordinary rice remaining stable. The foundation for this commodity was particularly good. Bianyuan Yin rice arrivals were very low, and inventories were not large. However, the market was quite sluggish, so prices remained flat.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Last Week's Commodity Futures and Soybean Prices Both Fell <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Commodity Futures: Last week, standard soybeans steadily softened. The opening price at the beginning of the week was due to the poor performance of the consolidated market and the gold market, and various parties were keen to sell. Subsequently, due to purchases by a few merchants and active spot sales, the market turned from weak to stable. Until the second half of the week, external factors such as weak sales and frequent soft product telegrams, and internal factors such as the conclusion of long-term price limits, led to a flat market sentiment and low gold prices. Therefore, it remained sluggish and trading was sparse. As a result, compared to the closing price at the end of the previous week, three and four-month contracts were down 0.09 [currency unit], and five and six-month contracts were down 0.08 [currency unit].</p>
<p>Commodity cake market prices also fell, especially for long-term contracts. At the beginning of the week, prices from Dalian were weak, gold prices fell, foreign firms stopped entering, and customers watched the market. As a result, prices for all months fell uniformly. Then, due to the activity of transshipment and mainland firms, the market stabilized. However, there was always a swing of about 0.01 [currency unit]. By the end of the week, the market was again sluggish, and sales of long-term contracts were strong, causing prices to gradually weaken. In the end, the market shrank by more than 0.5 cash. The closing price compared to the previous weekend saw March down 0.0275 [currency unit], April down 0.0375 [currency unit], May down 0.03 [currency unit], June down 0.045 [currency unit], July up and July down was 0.04 [currency unit].</p>
<p>Hardware: 20,000 Sheets of Eastern White Iron Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>The hardware market was quieter yesterday due to Sunday. With the exception of some decorative items, the overall market saw virtually no trading. As there were not many transactions, prices remained unchanged. However, imports saw the arrival of over 20,000 sheets of eastern white iron by Mitsubishi Company yesterday, leading to fears that market prices may decline in the future.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Still Quiet Last Week</p>
<p>Last week, silk sales through the banks in this city continued to be brisk. Enquiries revealed that although the textile factories in New York, Lyon, and other places had seen a turnaround in sales, and that the telegraphed prices were also increasing, the underlying situation was still weak. As Chinese silk was expensive, even if merchants sold it, they still had to lose over 200 taels per package. In addition, exchange rates remained high. The supply of goods in the hands of Chinese merchants was insufficient, and the raw materials for factory silk were limited. With the new cocoon harvest still several months away, there was no way to continue the operation. Fortunately, only four-tenths of the silk factories in Shanghai were operating, and the dry cocoons held by the financial community could still support work. Silk merchants were passive, generally waiting for the opportune moment. Transactions remained difficult to boost. The total number of yellow and white silk transactions for the week was just over 700 packages. Of those, Indian sales revived, and coarse silk purchases were strong. Current silk exports totaled about 1,300 packages. White silk head exports were also about 1,000 packages. The supply of dry cocoons could not meet the demand, and the market became more profitable. There were also no formal market prices. The prices of Chinese silk in the overseas markets in the United States and France trended upwards. The prices of Chinese silk at the US and French markets last weekend are listed below (unit: gold yuan per pound in New York, unit: francs per kilogram in Lyon):</p>
<p>| Silk           | New York | Lyon | Silk                | New York | Lyon |</p>

<h3 id="e152">Zhang Huizan's Utmost Mourning <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Hua</p>
<p>A letter from a friend in Hunan states that the death of the late Zhang Huizan, commander of the 18th Division, was both honorable and deeply mourned, worthy of record. Opinions on Zhang's life and posthumous reputation vary, but the consensus is, "It's difficult to please everyone, but strive to have a clear conscience." Zhang's death was fitting and will not be forgotten by history.</p>
<p>The letter states that Zhang was from Changsha, the capital of Hunan. During his life, he held various important positions, most notably as the head of the Hunan Provincial Police Department and concurrently the head of the Changsha Police Department. Although the position might not seem prominent compared to others, returning home in glory is a different matter. Moreover, Zhang never remained unemployed for more than three months. Thus, the term "honorable life" applies to Zhang.</p>
<p>After the news of Zhang's death reached Hunan, He Yunqiao (Jian) immediately proposed at a provincial affairs meeting to allocate six thousand yuan for the funeral of "the late committee member Zhang of this government" (Zhang concurrently served as a committee member of the Hunan Provincial Government) and appointed Cao Mengqi, a former subordinate of Zhang, as the director of the funeral arrangements. It is said that only Zhang's head was recovered, while his body was sculpted from sandalwood. Therefore, the obituary and condolence messages all contained the phrase "Xian Zhen returns to the origin."</p>
<p>Currently, Zhang's coffin is about to return to Hunan. The funeral office is hastily constructing memorial arches at various locations around the East Railway Station, showing utmost mourning. The horizontal plaques and couplets at various locations are also filled with praise. For example, the horizontal plaque at the main entrance reads "Integrity for Ten Thousand Ages," with the couplet "Sacrificing one's life for the people demonstrates great integrity for a thousand autumns." The horizontal plaque at the east gate reads "Loyal Heart and Red Blood," with the couplet "General Yan's head, Changshan's tongue, protect the rivers and mountains, and shine like the sun and stars." The horizontal plaque at the west gate reads "Noble Spirit and Heroic Light," with the couplet "Confucius said achieve benevolence, Mencius said choose righteousness, the earth is the foundation, the sky is the pillar." The horizontal plaque at the east second gate reads "Suiyang Loyalty," with the couplet "Loyalty penetrates the sun and moon, noble spirit fills the universe." The horizontal plaque at the west second gate reads "Xin Guo's Loyalty," with the couplet "Unyielding to power, what is death to discuss?" The horizontal plaque at the East Railway Station reads "Spirit Never Dies," with the couplet "Ten thousand ages of rivers and mountains retain righteousness, the winds and rains of Hunan weep for the loyal soul."</p>
<p>Those who died alongside Zhang include Brigade Commander Wang Jiejun, Deputy Brigade Commander Hong Hanjie, Regiment Commander Li Yuefeng, Zhu Guangrong, Acting Chief of Staff Zhou Wei, Battalion Commander Huang, and countless others. These men were all sons of Hunan. Therefore, white banners and mourning flags are seen everywhere, all to summon the souls of the dead to return.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Record of the Recent Tragedy of the "Daji" Steamer <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>Recently, the "Daji" steamer of the Dada Company caught fire on the Jiangyin riverfront due to sulfur, resulting in a loss of no less than hundreds of thousands [of dollars], and over a hundred passengers lost their lives. It is truly a major catastrophe in river steamer history. The Dada Steamer Company was founded by Zhang Jian, a virtuous man from Nantong. It originally had four steamers operating on the inner and outer rivers: "Dashun," "Daji," "Dade," and "Dahe." Later, with the progress of business, the smaller "Dashun" and "Daji" were discontinued and replaced with new steamers, "Daqing" and "Daji." The "Daji" steamer was particularly outstanding among the company's fleet, with the largest hull and highest speed. The company had been in business for decades without incident, except for the "Daji" steamer, which had its rapeseed oil plate broken by wind some years ago. Now it has suffered this tragic incident. The "Daji" steamer is truly "Daji" (greatly auspicious) no more. It is said that the shipowner directed the rescue efforts after the accident and nearly perished. His spirit of not avoiding danger is truly commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Trivial Notes on Planting Trees in the City Center <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Arbor Day began in the fourth year of the Republic [1915], scheduled to coincide with the Qingming Festival. Later, after the establishment of the National Government, Arbor Day was changed to the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, symbolizing commemoration. Since then, Shanghai has held ceremonies for Arbor Day every year. This is the fourth year, and the scale is growing, and there is more to see and hear, so it is impossible not to record it.</p>
<p>▲ Staff Vying to Photograph the Boss On this day, the scene was bustling, with no fewer than a hundred cameras coming and going. No fewer than thirty tripods were being carried. The city government's staff, skilled in this area, were invited to be photographers to keep as mementos and for publication. When the photographers saw the bureau chief arriving, they were extremely nervous, aiming their lenses at the bureau chief, taking pictures from left and right, repeatedly, fearing that they would not do well. Those who didn't know the inside story asked each other who it was. In reality, the staff were taking pictures of their boss.</p>
<p>▲ East Palace Endures a Scare The female students' dormitory of Datong University is magnificent, known as the West Palace, and facing it remotely is Fudan University's East Palace. The names of these two palaces are celebrated in Shanghai's youth circles. The tree planting preparatory staff and receptionists arrived at the ceremony venue in the morning. The site was remote and uninhabited, and there was no way to get food, so they all ate at Fudan. Many people serving in the Public Security Bureau participated in uniform. When the "queens" of Fudan's East Palace saw a group of young people striding in, mixed with armed police officers, the situation looked ominous. Rumors of an accident spread in the palace, and people anxiously inquired. Fortunately, Jiang Baiqi, Ai Dongrong, and Dong Hua Tangdi saw Yu Kuanduan arriving and told them the truth, and the group's doubts were dispelled.</p>
<p>▲ Please Look at Shanghai in the Future The tree planting site is in the city center, far from Zhabei, a thousand miles away. "Silent spring scenery, desolate evening cold," seems to describe this place. However, the buds of spring are just sprouting, just as the foundation of the city center is being laid. This year's tree planting in this area is a city government policy, hoping to use this festival to awaken public attention to the construction of the city center. It is said that the mayor mentioned that the city government's building in this area will open for bidding in April, begin construction in May, lay the foundation in July, and be completed in one year. The city's prosperity and growth are immeasurable. In the future, Shanghai's prosperity will be concentrated here. Today's concessions may become like Kunshan's Qingyanggang or Hangzhou's Gongchen Bridge, recovering without being recovered.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Strange Minerals <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>My friend Wei Junxin, recently returned from Germany, said that a month ago, a mountain in western Germany yielded a mineral with a color like jade, soft and translucent. There were many of these minerals, but they varied in size, with the larger ones weighing dozens of pounds. Each was individually formed, resembling bowls, bottles, basins, drums, balls, boots, umbrellas, and hats. He tried taking the thinnest piece, about one-quarter to one-third of an inch thick, and shot it with a powerful cannon shell, but it could not be penetrated. He also took the smallest one, which resembled a bowl, and subjected it to pressure exceeding ten thousand tons, flattening it. However, as soon as it was removed from the press, it returned to its original shape without any damage. Sharp blades could not cut it, hammers could not break it, and fire could not burn it. When corrosive aqua fortis was poured on it, it did not dissolve. Neither light nor heavy hydrogen lamps could melt it. No amount of tensile force could break it. All sorts of chemical and other methods were used to dissect and destroy it, but the mineral remained unchanged. Currently, many doctors of physical chemistry in Germany are studying its original substance and regretting that they are all large pieces without thin sheets, so they cannot be made into military uniforms. Otherwise, the weapons relied upon in recent wars will all become useless. I once read in the Tang Dynasty history that during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang, a certain country in the Western Regions presented a jade whip, slightly green in color, which could be wrapped around a finger, and knives and saws could not harm it, and water and fire could not destroy it. At first, I suspected it was a fabrication, but now, seeing what was found in Germany, it is probably the same type, and the record in the Tang Dynasty history is not false.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Recording Two Parallel Anecdotes <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Xun</p>
<p>A certain gentleman lived in Shanghai and worked at a certain accounting firm. The gentleman's paternal uncle had just returned from Zhangjiakou on leave and was staying at a certain hotel on Fourth Road. The uncle knew where his nephew lived, so he immediately telephoned the gentleman. After the gentleman finished his work, he drove to the hotel to see his uncle. The uncle and nephew were not much different in age and had been childhood friends. Now, after a long separation, they met again and shared their feelings. They were very happy. Soon, a beautiful young woman arrived, claiming to have just returned from buying cosmetics. The gentleman was surprised to see her and looked closely. The woman was certainly not his aunt. He whispered to his uncle, "Uncle, when did you get such a beautiful young star?" The uncle strongly denied it, saying that he met the lady on the way through Tianjin. Since arriving in Shanghai, she has also been staying here. The gentleman did not argue and watched. Unexpectedly, that evening, they both drank too much. Around midnight, the gentleman wanted to return home and planned to rent another room to stay in, but the uncle stopped him, saying that it was fine to share a room. The gentleman said that the uncle would sleep with the lady, he would sleep alone on the left.</p>
<p>A was good friends with B. Their relationship was closer than brothers. Later, A was wrongly imprisoned. A's wife wept every morning and evening, at a loss for what to do. A neighbor heard and felt sorry for her, so he told A's wife, "Why don't you seek help from your husband's friend, B?" A's wife suddenly realized. However, B was a lecher. Soon, he developed a romantic relationship with A's wife. However, A was not angry at all because B helped him and he was released from prison soon after. A considered this as repaying a debt of gratitude. One day, B rented a room in a hotel and invited A and his wife. That night, the three of them slept in the same bed. A's wife and B even embraced. A's magnanimity was truly a remarkable anecdote.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Japan to Hold Chinese Painting Exhibition <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Jiguan</p>
<p>According to the "Dongbao" newspaper, the Japanese have always attached great importance to Chinese art. This time, they have launched an unprecedented initiative to prepare for a Chinese painting exhibition, which has attracted attention from all levels of society. Here is a brief description of the information obtained, which may also be of interest to those who care about art.</p>
<p>▲ Masterpieces of Four Dynasties The paintings to be exhibited at the exhibition have been finalized through separate contacts by the Sino-Japanese Association and the Toyo Association with key figures in the Chinese government and famous collectors. They mainly include masterpieces from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties and creations by modern celebrities. It is said that most of them are treasures that are not easily seen by the outside world for a while.</p>
<p>▲ Inviting Celebrities Before the exhibition, the association also plans to invite Chinese and Japanese celebrities to participate in the grand event, and will fully facilitate all transportation. Most of the Chinese invitees are from Shanghai and Tianjin. There is also news that Puyi, Xu Shichang, Jin Yunpeng, and others will bring paintings to Japan for display.</p>
<p>▲ Exhibition Period Scheduled The exhibition period in Tokyo is scheduled to start on April 26 and last for 25 days. After that, it will be moved to Osaka until the exhibition is completed. Except for those whose owners are willing to sell, all the paintings will be returned to China. April and May are the peak season for cherry blossoms in Japan. In addition to appreciating art, those traveling east can also fully enjoy the mountains and rivers and appreciate the famous flowers. A grand gathering is expected to take place.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yilin</p>
<p>In the old family of the west of Zhejiang, Sun Lang was especially capable in building a family. He built his standard as the governor of Qizhou. He held the festival and often went to the Envoy. The sea and mulberry fields all changed. But he never lost his personality. I met you, a lowly person. His long beard fluttering like melon face. The ministers gathered in the garden. The officials of Yuanfeng were the compilers. The rules of Bali were all about debate. Ma Zhou belonged to the grass for Chang He, and he bowed. He burned his writing. At that time, the constitutional government was just the beginning. Ganling divided the ministry, and the violent wind rose. The army was viewed in the漳 River, and the leopard mist was hidden. He was a true prefect of Kyoto, and he boasted about his eyebrow dance. The pearl spring was surrounded by banners and flags, and the yellow crane tower moved with war drums. The banners were changed, and the flags were changed. He looked forward to the war in the Central Plains. The only thing that mattered was benefiting the country. He hated 絳灌 too much. After thanking things, he met Qing Yan, and he recognized his face in the sea of people. He often wrote to Guo Linggong, and the adults returned to the Huihe. The European wind and Asian rain suddenly thundered. The sea flew in groups, and the mountains changed. There was a letter from the head of the large pillar. He had to prevent the lone note from slandering, and he wanted to stop the plan before the seat. After leaving the fire house, he planned to hide, and each collected tears in the new pavilion. He also passed on the prophecy that he should be the right person. He said dangerous words to the Qin Emperor. He took up arms in the same room to build an army. The clouds turned and the rain covered, and the crows were lost. From then on, he became a history of mutual cutting. He had no weapon in his hand, and he was sad. One day, the beacon fire broke out in Wu Yue. The crown was no longer a monkey crown. Vinegar-soaked Cao Gong's wine was used in a jar. A few inches of glue could stop the river from becoming turbid. Otherwise, he would shake his arms and return to the empty valley. Lu Duan was not confused about the big things, and Fu Bi was especially outstanding in his later years. He was born on the same year as the Dingmao bridge. He heard that you were very ill, and he was worried about your banner. He went to the hospital in Shanghai. He heard that you were sick and went to the hospital in Shanghai to see him. Not long after, he passed away. The clouds flew up and down, and he chanted Dongye. All over the sea, he called you the leader. He thought of you and did not make a long song. The tide cried for the horse of Xu Jiang.</p>

None of the articles, novels, poems, and essays in this publication are not worth reading again and again. The content of this recently published issue is even more substantial, including Tang Bingruo's "Nationalist Essays," Yansu's "One Day," Ruoji's "Never Return," Xiao Jia's "Occasional Thoughts," and Zhengbo's translation of "Two Orphans" (continued), etc.</p>
<p>Although we have not been able to get a complete picture of Nationalist Essays, reading the first section, "The Meaning of Nationalist Essays," can make us understand the essence of this type of essay. For example, the author argues:</p>
<p>The emergence of nationalist essays is not as simple as commonly seen, such as sitting in an easy chair around a warm stove in the cold winter, or sipping fragrant tea in a bathrobe on a hot summer day, casually chatting with friends and moving this description onto the newspaper. Of course, this can also be said to be an essay. Others embrace singing girls in magnificent, exotic foreign houses, and arbitrarily write some short articles scolding the current society when the passion reaches its peak. This can be said to be an essay, but it belongs to slogans and has no real life. As for nationalist essays, they contain epigrams and pathos. In a short article with a central consciousness and upward direction, it can awaken the昏瞶 youth, encourage the revolutionary impulse to break through the front line of the烽火连天, fight for the rise and fall of the entire nation, and arouse indignation at the blatant imperialism's aggression against our country. Therefore, its topics, the great affairs of the world and the country, go without saying, as well as the trivial matters of the market, book reviews, news of acquaintances, feelings of wild scenery, scenes on the battlefield, the relics of the martyrs, the correction of ugliness, and one's own past that is worth recalling. As long as it is rich in the central idea of nationalism, this type of article belongs to the upward, progressive, and powerful works of nationalism.</p>
<p>The author's concise narrative can not only make us understand what a nationalist essay is roughly, but also indicates how we should choose materials for this type of essay. The points discussed in the first section, "The Value of Nationalist Essays," are even more distinct, acute and original. Because the full text is not finished, it will not be discussed in detail here for the time being. However, the image we get at the beginning of this article is so perfect and profound that it shows the precision of the argument in this article.</p>
<p>"One Day" is a short story in the form of a letter, writing about the emotions of an oppressed Annamite man who is trying to carry out a national revolution in a foreign land. The performance is so moving and powerful. After reading this article, we, the oppressed nations, not only sympathize with the suffering and misfortune of the small and weak nations, but also arouse the determination to work for the entire small and weak nations. This is the great value of this article, which has the central point of nationalist literature. For example:</p>
<p>...Although we have failed, our spirit will still not be depressed. At least this chills the hearts of the French imperialists.</p>
<p>I am already a prisoner. Prison is the hometown of revolutionaries. I feel unparalleled glory here. I am tasting the taste that revolutionaries are used to.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was the day we had scheduled. At 11 o'clock at night, we raised the high flag of Annamite independence. A large team sang revolutionary songs and fiercely attacked the base camp that ruled us. We originally had only a few hundred people, but more than a thousand people temporarily joined from the people. After a fierce battle, we failed because we lacked ammunition.</p>
<p>That respectable female comrade was killed by the enemy in the hail of bullets. Because of her heroic influence, everyone worked harder to move forward. More than a hundred people continued to sacrifice. By noon yesterday, those who were killed, injured, and arrested had been sentenced to each of our fates. However, few people escaped.</p>
<p>Because my right leg was hit and I fell to the ground, I was carried here like a pig yesterday. There are already many comrades here. The narrow room is crowded with many people. The air is extremely turbid. There are sentries patrolling outside, prohibiting prisoners from speaking occasionally.</p>
<p>I heard that the trial will begin tomorrow. Naturally, we are prepared for the death penalty.</p>
<p>I bribed a guard so that this letter could be sent out... (Third letter)</p>
<p>This kind of courageous revolutionary will and spirit for the small and weak nations is really worthy of our admiration. Of course, it can encourage readers to sacrifice themselves forward. Because the creation in the form of letters is easy to express. Since it has true emotions, it can be written arbitrarily in the text. It does not need beautiful words to embellish it at all, so its own is a type of literary work that is easy to touch readers. It goes without saying that our inner heart is deeply moved by it, and this is even more worthy of our attention because it has the central idea of nationalism, leading us to the correct path of struggling for small and weak nations.</p>
<p>The poem "Never Return" is a powerful work, a truly nationalistic poem. Each poem is full of heat and power, both heroic and impassioned, and is worth singing again and again. In terms of artistic skill, it surpasses many so-called slogan-type poems. The artistic conditions it possesses can be seen in the poem "Never Return":</p>
<p>From today onwards, we swear never to return</p>
<p>Whipping and chasing the fleeing enemy</p>
<p>Although the warhorses are exhausted and hoarse</p>
<p>Although the brothers are lying on the decaying grass in the sunset</p>
<p>Chase to his last position</p>
<p>There, rescue our slaughtered brothers</p>
<p>We fight for freedom</p>
<p>We kill the enemy for our brothers</p>
<p>The author's performance is so skillful and powerful. In short, we are able to get such substantial and great words on a not-very-large Vanguard Weekly, which is really gratifying. In the future, I believe that there will be even more profound and powerful words presented to our readers here.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Grassland Creative Special Issue <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>Combined Issue 11</p>
<p>Chinese pure literary publications are either declining or falling apart in the current state. Those that embrace the aim of promoting culture and striving to create new literature are rare nowadays. Especially those that instill correct ideas in readers with a pure attitude. Among Chinese pure literary periodicals, we have to recommend this "Grassland" weekly, which already has a considerable history.</p>
<p>Who is also saying that Grassland is a rare flower that has emerged in the barren Chinese literary garden, and it is the crystallization of the hard work of young gardeners. Therefore, the words in it are mostly full of upward youthfulness, as fresh as a spring night, as unrestrained as flowing water, and as majestic as a mountain peak. These kinds of works are really hard to see in other so-called big publications. At the same time, it also has the correct ideological direction, indicating a path that should be taken in literature. Because not long ago, the Chinese ideological world was really too chaotic. The publications placed before young people were either romantic or classical, either decadent or proletarian, especially this last kind of so-called proletarian literature, which instilled so many promising young people onto a deformed path. Although this kind of literary reading material that promotes incorrect ideas is flourishing, it is actually promoting the decline of Chinese new literature. If we want to save this only crisis in the Chinese literary world, we can only hope that the domestic publishing industry will produce more literary works with correct meaning in the near future. Then this Grassland Weekly author believes is one of the reading materials needed by modern young people. Moreover, its content has new improvements every time, whether it is poetry, novels, essays, etc., all the words are worth reading. This time, the creative special issue it published, each selected work has its great characteristics and can represent the unique style of each author. The exquisiteness of the words is of course unnecessary to describe, but the style of one or two articles creates a new format that is only seen in the Chinese creative world.</p>
<p>In addition to literary news, this issue includes the full-length creations "Diary of a Korean Girl" by Tang Zengyang, "Violet Description" by Zou Fang, "Defeat of Bad Luck" by Huang Huanruo, "Smile in a Dream" by Bai Xue, "Heart Shadow After Reunion" by Zhang Wei, and "Looking Forward to You" by Wang Tiehua, etc. Although the number of articles is not large, each one has a new style and is worth reading.</p>
<p>Tang Zengyang's "Diary of a Korean Girl" is a revolutionary literary work that uses a Korean woman's struggle for her nation as the center of the facts. Although it adopts the diary format, what it writes is not clichéd, but has a new style. The depiction of the woman's psychology is especially unique to the author's artistic skills. Now I excerpt a shorter one-day article from this girl's diary so that readers can understand how fluent the literature is and how rich the emotions are, and at the same time it is full of upward consciousness, such as</p>
<p>March 3rd</p>
<p>I'm always too lazy to get out of bed because I have a class at ten o'clock this morning, so around half past nine, I had to muster the revolutionary spirit that young women should have and jumped out of bed. After washing up, just as the class bell rang, I followed the red and green young female classmates to class. The professor who taught this class was Mr. Fan. His lectures on political science were really eloquent. Every word sympathized with the revolution of small and weak nations. There were many unique and correct insights that could be used as a reference for the Korean revolution, so I recorded it in detail in my notebook. I had nothing to do in the afternoon, so I translated a novel by an American master. I felt very satisfied and prepared to publish it in a magazine. Although my Japanese is better than my English, I am unwilling to translate the works of the Japanese imperialists who oppress small and weak nations, no matter whether they write about sympathy for the restoration of Korea or encourage their oppression of Korea.</p>
<p>I feel that the prosperity of Korea only hopes that our general female revolutionaries can work hard in China and unite with China and other so-called small and weak nations. Because Korea is already a country that has perished, it is really not easy to revive it from the heavy pressure of Japanese imperialism and get rid of their shackles by its own strength. Therefore, we unite with small and weak nations and fight on the same front, perhaps seeing a glimmer of hope. When the great Korean banner is high above our heads, I wish it in advance.</p>
<p>This kind of text that is easy for ordinary people to read, so-called "popularized", is most needed at present because of its production, but it already has the beauty of artistic value.</p>
<p>Zou Fang's "Violet Description" has a new creative style. The meticulousness of the words is like singing a beautiful prose poem for us. At the same time, it also has an upward consciousness. Such a portrayal cannot be achieved without superb artistic skills. It depicts two young people wandering in a mysterious street and finally gaining a sense of awakening, still retaining the most precious spring of young people. This is such a meaningful meaning that it is really rare in literary works. "Defeat of Bad Luck" We can understand from the name that it is an upward revolutionary work. We have read many of Huang Huanruo's creations in this publication, but I think this is a more satisfying masterpiece. He describes a woman who gave birth to a boy fighting against all evil forces. Of course, she can be victorious. The more he writes to the end, the more fully the upward spirit is expressed. As he said, "But even if the manipulation of fate makes us jump into the vast sea of people, we will definitely be able to defeat the devil-like fate by relying on our own strength. That is our song of triumph that can be played loudly. Our respective environments are bright and happy. Finally, we should work hard to obtain this kind of victory ourselves and not try to help others. And we must recognize the direction of our efforts and not run on the wrong path because of temporary indignation." These are such sincere and meaningful words that young people should listen to, right?</p>
<p>"Looking Forward to You" is a long sequel by Wang Tiehua. Although it is still unfinished, the more we read it, the more we feel its unique brilliance. Of course, the compactness of the structure is also the only important thing in creation. Those who read Wang Jun's "Looking Forward to You" can always understand that it is not only a powerful success in structure, but also a work of artistic value. We are unexpectedly happy to be able to read such a mature long masterpiece on a small piece of Grassland.</p>
<p>Of course, the other two articles are also worth reading. It is a pity that we could not see the whole picture of Zhang Wei's "Heart Shadow After Reunion" quickly. However, I always feel that it is worth unexpectedly praising that the words in this creative special issue can achieve such results and meet us on a small piece of Grassland Weekly.</p>
<p>Finally, the "Editor's Talk" has predicted that the poetry special issue and the criticism special issue will be published soon. I think there will be more satisfactory results because there are the most authors and poets in it. But the so-called poets here are of course those who have the cultivation and skills. We are waiting to read his more great works!</p>
