<p>時評</p>
<h3>積極造産（三）</h3>
<p>造産之道。昨評旣已提網揭示矣。然而「知之非艱行之維艱。」實行此道。固亦未易言也。</p>
<p>何以言之。積極之實行。首重有積極之心理。極之心理。爲生命之動力。一念之轉。何事不足爲。一念之差。又何事能爲。力之偉大。有如是者。我國人士。日處於積弱貧困而又地大物博之國土中。日處於外貨充斥而又外力壓迫之情勢下。産之應造。與應如何造。詎無知者。然而知則知之。行則未能。此無他。無積極之愛國心理。無積極之提倡國貨心理。以爲其動力耳。</p>
<p>他者且無論。今日我國都市中之大中學生。及各機關公務人員。其不衣西裝。西裝而不以洋貨爲材料者。殆佔少數。佔據其腦海者。僅爲都麗與時髦。愛國之觀念無有也。購買材料。但問花樣之新舊。提倡國貨之觀念無有也。反之或且存國内貨品决不及舶來貨品之觀念。學生靑年及公務人員。爲國家之之多數。又以主持家政之故。需要日用消費品（如衣料裝飾品等）甚鉅。其購買物品。關係國貨之興替更大。假如全國婦女。如能具有積極提倡國貨之觀念。購必先國貨。則其所表現於振興國貨之力。如加以統計。數目之大。當至可驚人。進而言之。兒女之心理。常因父母之行爲教育。無形轉移。如父母具有愛國家提倡國貨之積極觀念與實際行爲。則耳濡目染。此無數之靑年國民。亦必能養成强固之愛國觀念。都以購用外貨爲可羞。然而今日我國婦女界。究能人人具有愛國與實用國貨之觀念否。今日之利權外溢且不言。而養成全國兒童缺乏愛國觀念。其爲害於我國家前途。極不容忽視。</p>
<p>故造産不難。而難在此種心理之轉變。難於無鞭策行動之生命力。假如我國人都具有堅强之愛國與提倡國貨之觀念。則以我地之大。物之博。加以人力。假我十年。我國家産業之發達。蓋可操左劵。</p>
<p>積極愛國心理與提倡國貨觀念之建設。一方面固在於今後國人自身之覺悟。一方面則亦繫於政府之鼓勵與督促。以養成風氣。記者以爲今後我政府應切實執行。前規定學生學務人員制服及其他用品。於非必不得已時。必須購用國貨之通令。并勸導全國婦女。一律購用國貨。</p>
<p>外貨固應抵制。而積極之抵制則爲造産。如何而後能實行造産。則又在於國人積極愛國心理之建設。茲當國人高唱排斥日貨之際。謹以此意。貢其蒭蕘。</p>

<p>由上列兩表觀之·韓民在我東北之職業狀况·及其農作情形·已可見一斑·查朝鮮居留民會所管轄界内。韓民七千餘人中除最多數爲農業勞動者外。其他如執旅館業及妓館業與侍女業者。計三百餘人。而無任何職業者。亦在百人以上。上表係抄自遼寗朝鮮居留民會。其對於職業之分。與吾人所謂職業之觀點亦有别。彼所謂侍女。實爲妓女之變名。與妓館之妓女。並無若何分别。又表中所謂「其他自由業」「其他有業者」。固應作爲無任何正當職業者觀察。而「商業及委托業」「醫藥業」以及「各種會社之員」之類。其中或尚有一大部分爲無業游民。與販賣違禁物品。及其他不正當之業務者在也。此表雖爲遼寗一部分韓民職業之統計。要之其他各地韓人職業上之分配。實亦大體相同。至其農業情形。實至足令吾人驚駭。其在我東北三省耕種之水旱稻田。竟達二·八三一·八七○反。約合我國三百五十三萬九千八百三十餘畝之多。其將來可供水田耕種之用者。尚有三·四一六·○二一反。約合我國四百二十七萬餘畝。現時每年可收穫糙米。共爲九十四萬餘石。將來若再發達。必可倍之。此大宗食糧。每年除當地韓民自身食用外。大都運往日本。我國當此民食缺乏餓莩日增之際。而任此廣大田畝。爲外人所開拓所攘奪。事之失策。實無有更過於此者矣。（未完）</p>

<h3>日人儼然佔領萬寶山矣</h3>
<p>▲地方交涉絶無効果</p>
<p>▲駐萬日軍陸續補充</p>
<p>▲堰成水漲農民呼籲</p>
<p>▲形勢惡劣又進一步</p>
<p>長春通信、萬寳山案、中央旣認爲地方問題、未向日方提出嚴重交涉、而日方則以佔領萬寳山、卽爲佔領滿蒙計劃之一、故正喜我中央不注意萬寳山案、特積極發展其計劃、是以對於地方交涉云者、絶不接納我方之主張、同時對於馬哨口一帶、亦增派軍隊駐防、質言之、萬寳山已非我有矣、故此間各界、甚盼中央對於萬寳山案、迅向日方嚴重抗議、勿視該案與鮮人屠殺僑胞事件、截然兩事、而等閒置之、致中日人之狡謀云、茲紀此案近况如次、</p>
<p>▲日方非理要求　據日方華記者談、萬案交涉因雙方相持不下已趨停頓形勢在華方非韓農停工、日警撤退、稻田租約解除、斷難解决、其最後讓步、亦不過以賠償韓農損失爲止、在日方要求郝永德與鮮農所結之契約有效、否認華方賠償損失、爲先决條件、最後的在准許韓農如約種稻、溝堤佔用民田若干、根據租約按地出租、達到完成農塲計劃而後止、周市長與日領事、除正式公牒抗辯外、迭次商洽之爭點亦在此、兩不示弱、華方以土地主權關係綦重、故不讓步、日方以多年預定計劃、今始實現、特堅持抗爭、不達目的不止、背道而馳、恐一時不易解决、據聞日方官吏、現在領館協議結果、除派藏本赴市政處、先口頭提出八項要求條件、後補正式公牒外、尚决定一最後辦法、卽中國官憲如願賠償韓農損失、則以韓農此次全部損失額計算、作爲十年賠償、租約亦規定十年滿期、全部稻田、以五百垧計算、每年每垧收穫稻麥若干石、每石均價若干元、按年以十分豐收計之、賠償十年損失爲止、由中國官府、在秋穫時交納之、此其一、其他一部、卽本年韓農在萬寳山馬哨口稻區、掘壕築堰工料損失費額、及日軍出兵保護費額、各按全部計算、須由華方負責賠償之、此其二、上述兩項非理要求、是爲日方最後對抗手段、華官如能承諾、亦可解决等語、查此等要求、無異以武力攫奪我稻田、又凡接近日方者、所言亦如此、是可見日人圖佔萬寳山鎭之决心矣、</p>
<p>▲日方撤警增軍　萬案事變時、日軍佔領馬哨口、武裝警官紛紛調往、故日租界防務、不敷支配、據接近日人者云、田代領事、將前派日警秘密撤退一部份者、正爲此耳、惟留護稻田日警、尚有三四十名、又恐武力薄弱、特再派守備憲兵兩隊各十五名、前往協助補充之、加之留在馬哨口日軍便衣隊、韓人自衞義勇團、統計不下百數十兵力、日方并宣稱、遇必要時、再大批出動、否則日警隊暫不派遣外傳駐遼日總領林久、電田代將駐馬警隊、全部撤退等情、至今仍未實現、近日密撤夜退者、純係日領事自動配防計劃、並非我方要求撤警效力、赴馬協防之守備隊、已於十九二十兩日、夜間出發矣、在表面上、似爲撤退軍警一部、實際上則移牛作馬、換湯不換藥耳、</p>
<p>▲堰成後之水災　韓人在馬哨口築堰旣成、水卽暴漲、韓農乃放水灌田、附近民田自十三日起、卽被淹没、約二百五六十垧、至十八九二十等日、吉長一帶、連日大雨、並降巨雹、伊通河水暴漲、山水激湍下汜、漫溢兩岸、茲據下游官荒官屯·三姓屯·姜家窩堡·華家橋·亮衣門·各處華農被淹代表姜洪山劉長江馬振靑田俊　宫德等、於二十日來長、向縣政府市政處報稱、自韓農水堰築成後、伊通河水漸漲、深處距岸數寸許、近數日間、雨雹交加、河水出漕、堰斷中流、兩岸汜濫、上下游民田被淹没者、現達一千五六百垧、若再經大雨、傾斜面五六千垧之田苗、必無幸免者、如將水堰撤廢、水漲立消、若不妥爲防止、撤堰導流、則沿岸民田、勢成澤國、數十萬之農民生命財産、盡付東流、秋收已半絶望云云、周市長馬縣長據報後、已决計提出抗議、要求日領速飭韓農撤堰矣、</p>
<p>▲日人救濟韓人　馬哨口韓農、糧食缺乏、頗起恐慌、作工韓人、日給　米飯一飽、餘則早晚吃粥、日領田代、乃特令頭　溝日本市民萬案後援會長下德直助、召集委員會議、討究救濟辦法、已於十九日開會、在鄉軍人會長四戸·地方委員議長勘畸·居留民會長田中·自主同盟會長箱田長友會長丸山·靑年聯會長小澤·及警署長武波·領館主任藏本·均出席、議决募金救濟、購運糧食、由下德·四戸·田中·箱田·武波等、負責辦理、其募金辦法、（一）日韓商民、不分男女老幼、每人捐義金日幣二角、按月輸納、由下德四戸等、協同日警、挨戸捐募、（二）自由捐輸者、一律交北滿日報實業新聞·朝日新聞支局、解交後援會、購糧輸運馬哨口、由稻田日警派出所主任中川支配分發之、現聞暫募日金三千元、以資救濟、不足時、繼續募集、（二十二日）</p>

<p>▲病院中之參觀　十一時半、平壤市府派産業主事藤田勝三郎·巡查森尾廣到旅館、云係奉命保護、請准許隨往各處、雖明知其爲監視行動、但殊無法拒絶、遂同往平南道廳平壤市府、謁道知事園田寬·大島良士、十二時到平壤施醫院、探望在院調養之被難僑胞、該院在出事後、曾收容受傷之華僑一百十人、内女人八名、入院後死去者十八名、内女子四名、經調治後先後出院者五十餘名、現在住院男子四十一名、女子四名、此均醫院長所述、向其索閱傷亡表、則諉稱已送往道廳、院内未存、華僑所居爲醫院極下之三等病室、蓆破屋垢、每一號容七八人、空氣極爲混濁、各個所裹扎绷帶、皆汚穢不新、由此可證明醫院方面、對於救治、並不盡力、各傷者傷痕均在頭腕臂腿等部、一僑胞傷痕徧體、左睛爲綳帶所蔽、臥地蓆上呻吟不絶、同室受傷者云、其左目被擊破、業已成盲、傷經多日、迄未醫瘉、其他各個受傷人、亦均臥地呼痛、令人旣不忍聞其聲、復不忍覩其狀、記者曾擬爲攝影、光綫甫經對好、日本醫院長厲聲制止、謂此地不許拍照、故此種凄慘景像、未能得一寫眞、以報告於國人也、養病之女子、中有朱李氏者一人、見記者來、哭述丈夫被毆身死、一八歲子、亦爲擊斃、祇餘渠與懷抱之三齡幼子、記者聆述、欲尋一語慰藉、竟不知所措、一般僑胞自入醫院來、迄已兼旬、未獲見一親故、知記者爲華人、莫不涙承於睫欲一罄苦衷、祗以醫院長一再阻止談話、并以院内其他日鮮病人、厭惡喧嘩爲詞、催促速出、不得已含涙離院、行在天井、猶見受傷僑胞、從窗際注視、各人皆熱涙滿眶、依依悵望、記者斯時腦際、熱血上衝、頭迷目眩、激剌至不辨方向、五内是酸是辛、悉不知矣、</p>
<p>▲慘死僑胞墳墓　自平壤醫院出後、往市外慘死僑胞假墓展拜、其地在大同廳屬長山麓、去平壤市十餘里、車行處、望見路旁菜園房屋、被焚者五處、殘磚斷瓦、徧地皆是、尤以一粉坊燒燬最慘、地上祗餘斷梁殘棟十數根、及未焚燬之磚砌烟囱兩具而已、一般朝鮮婦女、老幼則</p>
<h3>平壤鄉間菜園被毁後情形</h3>
<p>傴僂菜圃中、尋採果蔬、此輩頭腦單簡、竟不自知其爲人利用也、時許抵假墓、則所云死亡九十五人之墳墓、不過堆成五大土脊、前供香案及市府尹之花圈二個、有四土坑、長三丈、寬一丈三尺許、一土坑長二丈、寬相等、據引導之藤田言、每土坑埋二十人、較少者十五人、共九十五人、埋葬前由道廳編成號數、留一年貌淸單、以便日後中國方面查考、尸前則置一號椿、以與年貌單對照、但據記者丈度、每一坑至少埋葬三十五六人、綜計五坑、約在百六七十人以上、當撮得一影、俟歸時冲晒製圖、嗣與同行獻香行禮、憑弔半晌歸市、</p>
<p>▲搗毁商店視察　華僑商店被搗毁者、以朝鮮人居住區爲甚、日人居住區較輕、綢緞莊如謙合盛·永慶德等家、門窗破碎、貨物優良値錢者、則爲掠去、粗下者、則撕成細縷、踏踐汚穢、謙合祥一家、被撕麻布夏布、約在百餘疋上、餘館如東華園被毁最甚、樓上下傢具、無一完整、卽門窗間壁、亦毁劈細碎、在被搗各家中、以該號爲最重、鐵器工廠永盛公、所存鍋爐等物、被用鎚斧擊毁甚多、所幸該號自鑄、原料尚存、費一番工事、卽仍可成物、華商總會、牆壁屋頂、皆爲揭掀毁破、頃</p>
<h3>平壤中國料理泰源樓被搗後情形</h3>
<p>假謙合祥破屋爲臨時辦公所、暫時辦理僑民死亡調查等事、因一般辦事人、均係被搗各家經理股東、遭難之餘、無心辦事、故京城華商總會、特派來周照高王公温·張友芳·劉守符·周寳善諸人、仁川派來趙仲選·王明昊兩人、前來幫同善後、記者復到各臨時收容所、視察一週、每所駐有日警一人、防護意外、避難僑衆、無事則不外出市街、簡直可謂無華僑踪跡、已死之僑胞、日園田寬官憲給予五百元（日金）撫卹費、由死者家屬具領、而經華僑商會證明之、受傷者給予五十元、頃間支領慘死撫卹費者二十九人、支領受傷費者約五十餘人、</p>
<p>▲道知事之談話　平壤屬於平南道、道知事等於我國道尹、惟警察教育財務市政諸權、均系屬之、伴同之日人、堅請一見道知事園田寬及平壤市府尹（同於我國市長）大島良士、記者曾詢以處理華僑之善後、園田寬言、此次事變、出於倉卒、未得防患未然、頗以爲憾、貴國僑民在平壤者、無一定確數、約在六千人左右、事發時、經警察保護、同送入一臨時收容所、曾收容至五千餘人、爲備食宿、派大隊警察晝夜保護、有回山東者、則爲免費送往鎭南浦、搭海船而行、道廳方面、且爲致送零用數元、收容所至二十日截止停辦、未走之貴國僑民、由商會接辦收容、道廳給予十日食糧、其與外間有債目往還者、雖然賬簿損毁、但已囑向債務債權相互質對、道廳方面總設法使其容易解决、市府尹大島良士、對於慘案責任較輕、故所談祗謙撝之詞、（二十五日自京城發）</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>電力的田場</p>
<p>世界中最新式的田塲。是在英國瑟來府與蘇昔克司府邊界上的東格林司推Ｅast　Grinstead地方。那田塲的面積。計有地六百畝。是三人所共有的。而主持其事的。是一位麥秀士先生。Ｂ·Ｍatthews他費了畢生的心力。專在研究如何利用電力。以帮助田間的工作。靠著他的才能。竟能在這别開生面的田塲上。把電力分作六十七種各各不同的用處。每一個蜂房中。用電力生出光與熱來。因此之故。蜜蜂們每年都能提早工作。每一蜂房所釀的蜜。可比平常多釀十七磅。要是能盤計算起來。爲數就很可觀了。養馬也用電力。可以節省不少人工。他制有一種特殊的機械。凡是刷馬飼馬等事。都由這機械代勞的。雞棚中也利用電力。製成一架特别的鐘。到了冬季。能發出光亮。由半暗而漸漸明亮起來。這是人造的日出。比眞的日出提早一小時。因此使那些雞更爲健康。而能産生更多的蛋。此外如耕種。孵卵。榨牛乳。乾草秣。滅害蟲等。也完全利用電力。得到極滿意的效果。</p>
<h3>桑子河畔金鐘犬</h3>
<p>— 李胥梵</p>
<p>犬能守戸。固其天性。近代因潮流之演進。蓄犬之家較多人類以其天性靈敏。各就種類之異。分有獵犬警犬賽跑犬之訓練、犬亦恃其特長而助人類工作。然亦有不待人養。而能爲人盡守夜之責者。惟金鐘犬一種耳。余友趙輝三君。新自歸綏路局解職回南。同行者不下二十餘人。途經桑子河　帶。環山疊疊。獸迹斑斑。慣經斯地者。咸携篷帳等具。沿途蓋宿。趙君亦復爾爾。詎於某夜魚更初躍。正在帳内倚篷緣就寢。將沉沉睡去。遽聞足迹彳亍。踯躅篷外。疑有野獸來侵。急喚同伴戒備。中有熟稔該地情形者告曰。何其驚惶若是耶。愼母恐。蓋謂此聲之來。非野獸也。廼金鐘犬排隊梭巡驅除狼類。爲吾輩盡保護之責矣。趙君疑信參半。就篷隙外窺。果見黄犬三五成羣。身高若童大逾常犬。惟兩目炯炯有光。形殊可畏。予以麫包饅首。彼亦就飼。見生人不避。一若豢養之家犬者然。趙君笑曰。此誠不受薪餉之臨時衞隊也蓋金鐘犬一物。在長江下游之地不僅見。嘗産棲於綏遠高山叢林間四跂鋒銳異常。善跳躍擅尅狼。見狼來。彼必躍騎其背。前足跂爪卽力挖狼目。必中。狼踣亦不食。或遇狼狽衆多之時。犬知寡不敵衆。遂大吠音若銅鈴鏗鏗。同類聞聲應集。漫山遍野而會攻。竟至數百頭之多。非至狼奔潰傷死不止。頗有愛羣互助之精神。故桑子河一帶。路綫遥遠。交通不便。兩邊又崇山峻嶺。村落絶鮮。狼類復出没其間。行旅者輒沿途搭帳過宿。設無金鐘犬以司夜。勢必行旅裹足。視爲畏途矣。可見天之造物生人實有不可思議之造化。此犬能具拒狼衞人之特性。頗饒研究之趣味。據該處土人謂此犬不受人養。性喜野居。設爲人携歸豢養。彼必憂鬱絶食。故不能留爲家犬遺種耳。兹得趙君之報告。姑錄之以餉讀者</p>
<h3>宇宙小姐</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>本報本月二十六日圖畫週刋載本年世界各國所選出之代表美人。近在美國高文斯墩複選。比利時杜樹第女士。以體格健全。被選爲美人中之尤美者而榮膺宇宙小姐之尊號云云。原圖具在。有目共賞。見仁見智。各憑主觀。自臣視之。敢曰不美。試將其頭髮及足鞋掩却。而觀其全身。極具魁梧奇偉之姿。隱合暗噁叱咤之勢。似楚覇王。想不到是虞姬也。臣最好咬文嚼字。大凡讚頌美人之女性者。總不離乎康熙字典女字偏旁之字。如婷婷嬝嬝嫵媚嬋娟之類是也。欲讚其健全如女俠女將等。亦必宜以剛健合婀娜之句兼稱之。中西觀念不同。今一選再選而得美中尤美者。其評判乃爲體格健全四字。似體育家拳師軍人之考語。施之小姐。殊嫌帽不合頭。譬猶以體態苗條了稱男子。男子不愜意。類推小姐。亦未必愜意。臣又最好替人担憂。上下四方曰宇。古往今來曰宙。以如此第一而又第一之美人。未必守獨身主義。試問從何處覓一宇宙少爺以配耦之。無已。臣思得一人。軍閥侯景稱兵。自署曰宇宙大將軍。梁武見檄大驚曰。將軍乃有宇宙之號乎。杜小姐肯嫁侯將軍。爲之執柯。所欣願焉</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>

<p>石友三大概是生有反骨的。最善於反。一反馮。二反蔣三反閻。三年之間。連反了三次。那個「友」字。大可以砍去一頭。改爲「石反三」。不道最近他又厲兵秣馬。反起張來。那麽「石友三」又該改爲「石反四」了。但願他卽此而止。不要再「反五」「反六」的反下去吧。</p>
<h3>名旦與名劇玉堂春</h3>
<p>— 綃</p>
<p>由淸末至今三十年來。亦戲非常發達。駸駸乎有成爲中華民國國劇之勢。其間名伶輩出。指不勝屈。自梅蘭芳享盛名以後。風氣又爲之一變。就是後前以生角爲中心者。一變而以旦角爲中心。伶　界大王的頭銜。不屬於生而屬於旦。旦行名角又紛紛繼起。遂有所謂梅（蘭芳）程（艶秋）尚（小雲）荀（慧生）四大金剛。鬚生則日見式微。多成爲名旦附庸。並且名旦還不止此數。四大金剛而外。尚有徐碧雲與坤伶雪艷琴等。都能獨張一軍。又有南方四金剛小楊月樓劉筱衡王芸芳趙君玉。亦均具有相當的造詣。其勢力也眞大極了。名旦旣如此之多。當然旦戲也較生戲爲時髦。除掉各名旦各自編排新戲而外。老戲最紅的也有好多齣。而最時髦的老戲。却又要算玉堂春。這一齣戲。各名旦無不重視。每度南下來滬。都要貼演幾次。每演又必能賣滿座。可見社會歡迎之熱烈。荀慧生尤以此戲膾炙人口。徐碧雲復排出前世玉堂春。藉玉堂春三字。以爲號召之具。不久以前。梅蘭芳爲振　贛災在大舞臺表演三夕。也有一夕貼演玉堂春。照此情形。我們就說玉堂春是第　齣名劇。也的確不爲過啊。現在更談談玉堂春這齣戲的本身。此戲本事。原是事實。最先是秦腔。至淸末方改皮黄。所以名爲新玉堂春。但戲詞却大半還是原本子。因此之故。頗有不叶韻的地方。記得從前本刋上曾載過天虛我生與某君討論的一篇稿子。可是已完全不憶了。其不　韻之處。大家諒都知道。可不必列舉出來。我只談此戲所以不叶韻的原因。原來晉人講話。多用鼻音。東眞兩韻極容易混淆。如「渾源州」。晉人却呼作「紅源州」。紅和渾幾無分别。一經改爲皮黄。用中州韻。那就不叶了。當時初改皮黄。何竟漫不加察。囫圇吞棗。致成爲名劇之玷。未免可惜。洪洞二字。更是弄不淸楚。不知此戲原是事實。旣非洪桐。尤非洪潼。實在却是洪洞。仄聲而非平聲。洪沿在周爲楊侯國。在北齊爲洪洞鎭。在隋爲洪洞縣。一直相沿至今。明淸屬山西平陽府。民初重定行政區域。則屬山西河東街。玉堂春一案的卷宗。現仍保存於洪洞縣政府。出一角大洋。便可看到。那麽。今之人對於今縣名。何以弄不淸楚。未始非一件怪事。再談此劇所以能成爲名劇。也還是一般名旦把它唱紅的。不過在我看來。單演三堂會審。始終只有一塲戲。簡單已極。唱起來却非三刻鐘以至一小時不可。唱的人固然太累。聽的人也覺得不耐。可算是極不易討好聽衆的一齣戲。然而竟紅到如此。到也令人不解呢。</p>
<p>▲藝術界消息　小說家張枕緣君兼擅草書。前與馬鶴年君合作書畫扇面展覽。瞬卽售罄。後至者無以應。因於昨日起仍在北京路良晨好友社。續開展覽會十天。此次陳列之件。悉爲金面。由張君作雙行草書。自錄其創作小說全篇·函扇不同。馬君合作之靑綠山水。亦倍加工細。每件廉售五元云。（碧潤）</p>
<h3>美國婦女生活雜談（四）</h3>
<p>— 寄</p>
<p>▲職業　美國女子教育。旣與男子有均等的機會。在職業上也與男子有並進的趨勢。伊們出了學校。境遇貧苦的。果然亟亟謀職業以維持生計。便是富有的。也並不想在家享樂。而願意在社會上服務。伊們以爲一個女子。受了教育而不爲公衆服務。是失却辦教育的宗旨。謀不到職業。是暴露女子的弱點。是女子無能力的表現。也是很羞恥的事情。還有許多婦人。雖然伊丈夫居優越的地位。有豐富的進欵。但伊還是要謀事做。伊們能勤儉。能耐苦。卽使白天在外服務。回家照常處理家政。慙以小家庭中很少雇用婢僕的。女子職業最普遍的。要算商舖店員。各都市大小商家。隨處都有伊們的芳踪。據我（錢博士自稱）觀察。伊們服務的成績。勝於男子。如（一）動作靈敏（二）頭腦淸晰（三）對人有禮貌。其次機關裏的打字員。書記。醫院裏的看護。幼稚園保姆。中小學教員…等。是女子最大的出路。此外在大學研究院畢業從事於自由職業的。有醫師。有律師·有會計師·有大學教授。差不多男子的職業。一部分給女子佔有了。</p>
<p>▲參政　女子天性柔和。魄力和果斷。當然不能比男子。所以各國政治舞台上活動的女子。還只是少數。美國女子參政的歷史。算是比較悠久的了。據我所知。美國女子在政治上地位最高的。是四十八州的州長之中。有兩位是女子。州政府的秘書長。及高級政務官。女子也不少。市長也有幾位。女法官更多了。在喔海喔州（Ｏhio）最高法院的女法官中。女子也占得一席。可見美國女子參政。比各國都發達。又如議會選舉時。伊們也爭得很劇烈。但不是爲自己爭。是爲女界名額爭。或是爲候補女議員的票數爭。依目前形勢來推測。很可以爲伊們參政前途抱無限的樂觀。（終）</p>

<h3>女人女人（四）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>陸先生走出丁家的大門，喜悅的神情却換上了匆遽的容色。想想方才和丁小姐所談的話，果然自己覺得是僅有的得意之佳作；但是明天的期約將如何應付呢？數着袋裏的錢，祇賸下了兩塊大洋，不必說要講置一件珍貴的禮物是事實所不許可的，便是買一束好些的花，也得使他煞費躊躇啊。</p>
<p>依然回到了學校中，假期中的宿舍裏眞凄凉得可憐。他一個人獨自估量着未來的命運，像有無限的光明包圍在重重的雲霧裏；他越想越渺茫，越想越空虛，終於在渺茫和空虛的熱夢之中，度過了無可奈何的一宵。</p>
<p>醒回來，天還没有亮。但是他畢竟决定了他最後的計劃。再睡也睡不住了，算算時間還來得及去趕早車，忙披衣起身，臉也不洗，被也不疊，什麽東西也不拿，匆匆地上火車站去。</p>
<p>包，籃，箱子和人，塞滿了三等車的車廂之中，他祇是單身的一個，偶然聽得了月台上小販們的喚賣聲，總算想起了他的母親曾經呌他在回去的時候買一些香蕉的，他就忍痛地費去了僅餘的四毫大洋，買了一簇香蕉，算是他帶回家去的僅有的禮物。</p>
<p>蘇州到了。從車窗裏望望高聳的北寺塔，還是那樣岸然地傲視着這不長進的古城；祇是車站外龐雜的人聲和馬蹄聲，却顯然表示出它們的急切的期待。陸先生很不願意聽得許多馬車夫的招攬主顧的的呌喊，因爲這對於他自己的心靈上，好像始終會覺得有一種異常的惶愧和怨黷。</p>
<p>他的家離開車站不遠，他提了僅有的一簇香蕉緩緩地走去。但許多車夫都失望了：因爲在他們最初的心理中，像這樣一個從上海來的洋裝客人，至少可以多賺一些車錢的。</p>
<p>景物依然，一陣犬吠聲追逐着陸先生到了他自己的家裏。他望見了自己的門庭，祇覺得是煩惱；他惟有默禱着：這一次無可奈何地回來，不要再無可奈何地回去吧！</p>
<p>「小榮！是你麽？穿了洋裝，像換了一個人哩！」當陸先生踏進大門，就把門邊立着的那個小夥計呆住了，他的似乎驚奇的語調，使陸先生不能不低下了頭去，祇輕輕地問了一聲：「爸爸在家裏麽？」</p>
<p>「巧得很！今天我們的馬車没有去趕早車的生意，他也許在裏邊。說起來，他們已經望了你多時了，怎麽到今天才想着回家來？」那個小夥計很快樂地說</p>

<h3>美棉估計收成良好</h3>
<p>國民社二十八日紐屋命電、此間估計美國今年棉花收成可得一千四百萬包、計其産生成本每磅須十四仙、但目下市况苟無大進步、則新花登市後、每磅祇可售九仙云、</p>
<h3>糧食　天晴米市暴瀉一元</h3>
<p>▲新閘　昨日西路來源尚湧、各貨交易極呆因天時放晴、各店號購者寥落、人心看疲、厚更與早晚稻等貨跌四五角、蘆洋尖及變隂元胃口寥寥、故縮去三角光景、惟埠尖貨稀、價照原盤、據昨四五點鐘調查蘇州河畔、共計船戸二百六十餘艘、每船平均九十石、計總數白更及秈米等二萬三千四百擔之譜、</p>
<p>▲南市　各帮來源約念餘號、城鄉店銷因天時已晴、進意减少、行吃亦薄、買方臨市極少、人心向下、厚粳行情較昨猛瀉一元、早稻薄稻二種到積尚多、客帮全無成交、本街去化有限、價亦低落六七角、洋蘆尖貨缺胃舌、形仍撑立、隂化到銷二平、勢無榮辱、客尖裝來不多、故趨勢續疲、</p>
<h3>粉市步開步高</h3>
<p>▲長江及内地帮逐盤爭購</p>
<p>昨日粉市初仍盤旋、因天色仍佳、洋麥亦互有一二角上落、市氣甚平、惟二盤以後、步步奇俏、以内地及長江各帮、終感大水汎濫、一時難以收拾、糧價飛騰、荒年已無可免、故買戸依然大暢、不論近遠、均步步爭購、所以人心激動、步開步高、近期因廠家擯住、尤形俏俐、至遠期則阜豐暢抛約達二十餘萬、勢稍緩和、結果本月份較前日漲二分半、八月份漲二分七釐半、九月份漲二分半、十月份漲一分七釐半、十一月份漲二分、十二月份漲一分半云、</p>
<h3>操縱居奇下之麥市</h3>
<p>▲近期抬起一錢外……遠期稍挫</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面突見巨大之變動、上午初開尚形平穩、旋以内地帮鑒大水爲災、交通阻斷、小麥來源、决受打擊、因遠期洋麥又定可交、近期則非本麥不可、所以盡量吸收、爲操縱居奇之準備、歲尚未荒、投機者卽事高抬、國内糧價之不固定、甚爲民食憂也、下午開價卽已暗漲、後則愈抬愈湧、較前日收盤、竟差錢三分、遠期以尚有洋麥顧忌、抬價略挫、結果八月份漲一錢、九月份漲七分、十月份漲六分、十一月份漲四分、十二月份漲三分、現麥因貨見稀、到源中斷、喊價亦高起三四分、開崑山·安亭·崇明·鎭江·滁州·蓬萊外崗等麥二千餘包、由福新華豐辦去云</p>
<h3>絲茶　屯溪珍眉法銷活動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、屯溪歙縣遂安等路珍眉綠茶、英莊協和洋行、因接海外來電需求、進意頓趨濃厚、錦隆同孚等行、亦均大起搜辦全市成交共達二千五百餘箱、交易之旺、爲近來所未有、惟婺源高莊珍眉、仍無大宗銷路、針眉秀眉等貨、市面益形堅挺、蝦目珠茶、亦較前略形走銷、茶市大勢、轉呈堅穩之象云、</p>
<h3>杭紹新繭衣續有運滬</h3>
<p>杭紹各屬、今歲春夏二繭、均告歉收、繭衣産額亦减而滬埠需貨頗殷、昨日滬杭又有杭紹新繭衣二百四十擔運滬、市面依然俏利云、</p>
<h3>洋莊絲有行無市</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲經、類均有行無市、查紐約里昂等絲銷不動、滬埠去電均不見轉、歐莊極思抑價囤積、而華絲商虧本不售、市氣寂靜、成交無聞云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　福州新元紅枝已到</h3>
<p>▲售價約百兩</p>
<p>福州所産元紅枝、核小肉厚、甘芳逾恒、宿稱名品、今庚出數甚歉、地價高昂、鮮菓早經登塲、惟干菓因須日晒火烘、首批貨方於昨日運抵申地、共計二百餘箱、其中半屬轉運他埠、半屬行家自辦、聞成本須一百三十元之譜、大約售價當在百兩上下、猶未成盤云、</p>
<h3>糖市　抛貨碗靑盛開</h3>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖仍無升沉、紐約期糖各月份均比前電跌一分、爪哇現期糖亦依然不動、公會場劃盤、以去化呆滯、買氣沉寂、市形異常萎靡、荷糖二十四號粗砂白喊十一兩五錢、香港貨十一兩四錢、仍少問津、二十號中砂白十兩○九錢、略有交易碗靑八兩六錢至六錢半、趨勢且優、太古車糖、ＤＹ嘜十一兩八錢、Ｂ嘜十二兩、亦乏受手、抛貨荷糖、有華新及炳昌二號兜售、卽裝碗靑、價荷幣四元三角、南盛隆號售開九月份貨、價四元一角七分半、行方進意殊淡、雖少數略有成交、市象殊且萎弱之跡云</p>
<h3>五金　英白鐵定價回落半鎊</h3>
<p>▲全市概觀　昨日五金市况、表面尚屬熱閙出口之貨爲數甚夥、但統係先前之批定者、而昨市之談判、除幾種切需品外、大路貨之開出、依然無多、但長江路因日貨不能裝出、所以均改辦英美諸貨、故雷同於日貨之平白鐵·瓦楞鐵·新鉛絲·法西釘等、近來頗有趨好之局面也、</p>
<p>▲英白鐵定貨甚旺　昨日定出之英白鐵、共有四五百噸之多、行情較前日來價還落半鎊計每噸爲十五鎊、查係八九月份裝船之期貨云、</p>
<p>▲大連帮靜極思動　大連帮昨日對於五金去路、已有靜極思動之勢、但同業對於該帮開價十分低廉、蓋希望該帮之有良好之去胃耳、</p>
<p>▲長江内河各帮暢辦美白鐵　昨日四十八張美白鐵、走銷於長江内河各帮、共有六七百担之多、誠爲半年來出路最旺之期也、行情四十八張十九兩二錢半、三十八張十九兩五錢、三十二張十八兩五錢、二十五張十七兩五錢、二十一張十七兩二錢半云、</p>

<h3>法公廨一日正式接收</h3>
<p>▲第三高分院長梁仁傑</p>
<p>▲第二特區院長應　時</p>
<p>▲改良監獄之管理方法</p>
<p>收回上海法租界公廨一案、業經中法政府代表交涉完畢、關於收回該公廨之協定、已於本月二十八日、由雙方代表、在南京外交部正式簽字、協定全文、共十四條、換文一件、其内容辦法、大致與公共租界協定相同、同時司法行政部訓令、江蘇高等第二分院院長徐維震特令上海第一特區地方法院院長楊肇熉、準備負責接收、而法政府方面、亦由駐滬領事、飭令該公廨準備、於八月一日正式交代、茲將該公廨收回後之組織與人選、以及接收手續與以後之改革、分别探錄如下、</p>
<p>▲收回後組織　司法行政部、對於法公廨收回後之組織、業經决定、將原有公廨、改組爲上海第二特區地方法院、並增設江蘇第三高等分院爲上訴機關、以求完全適合中國司法制度、並因該廨祗有兩庭、不敷審理案件、已决定增設兩庭、惟不分民刑及執行等名目、又因原有房屋不敷辦公、已在該廨對面和玫坊租定七幢、作爲第二特區地方法院之用、又在西愛咸斯路恒愛里、租定房屋六幢、作爲第三高等分院辦公處、</p>
<p>▲兩院之人選　司法部對於改組後兩院院長庭長及推事之人選、已在各省法院中、選定品學兼優之法官數人調任、茲經本報記者探悉、已經内定者、第三高等分院院長一席、由江西高等法院院長梁仁傑調任、第二特區地方法院院長一席、由公共租界第一特區法院民庭長應時升任、第三高分院首席檢察官一席、聞由湖北高等法院首席檢察官錢謙調任、兩院庭長人選、正在物色中、但聞第一特區地方法院周翰庭長、有調任之說、至於推事人數、内定六人至八人、人選亦在遴選中、惟據確息、第一特區法院周仁達、决定調任第二法院推事、以上各人選、一俟接收後、卽可明令發表、</p>
<p>▲監獄須改革　據上海司法當局消息、收回法公廨協定内容、與公共租界相同、惟監獄管理權、法方完全交還中國、不若公共租界之協定、監獄管理權仍在外人手中、上海司法當局、對於法公廨監獄、原有管理方法、缺點頗多、如（一）屋小人多、不合衞生之道、（原有監獄、初係一人一室、後增至三人一室、）（二）管理太嚴酷、有違人道、（三）教誨犯人、採用宗教式、僅用教士數人教誨、似難收效、（四）工作與休息並不調劑、且不量犯人之能力、强迫從事、譬如文人强其作苦工、似屬不合、且給與奬勵金亦極少、收回後對於上述數點、均須加以改革、且對於監獄房屋、亦擬加以修改、並由蘇浙皖贛等省監獄富有經騐及幹練之管理員百餘人、來滬充任、此項人員、日内卽可到滬、並已製定皮鞋九十餘雙、制服一百九十餘套、以便應用、</p>
<p>▲經費尚不足　法公廨收回改組後、因較前擴大、故經常費亦應增加、而在法院本身、每年收入、總算不過二十萬元之譜、但改組後、兩院費用、每月至少須三萬元、（兩院月須二萬數千元、監獄方面、月須七千元、）一年計算、非四十萬元不辦、與本身收入尚差一倍、聞此項不敷之數、俟成立後、須由司法部籌撥補助、</p>
<p>▲定一日接收　第一特區法院楊院長、於前日非正式晤及法領事甘格林、甘氏表示、已飭令法公廨於本星期六（八月一日）全部交代、並稱、自八月一日起、監獄一切費用、亦卽停止、本人卽晚赴京、卅日回滬、楊院長準備八月一日正式接收、並定今日會晤甘氏、商洽接收手續、楊院長稱、接收後、卽積極籌備、預期在八月十六日正式成立、萬一籌備不及、至遲在九月一日務須宣告成立、</p>
<p>▲法領赴京　法總領事甘格林氏交涉委員、因在普陀游玩、且因連日雨水太大、故前日公廨協定簽字時、該領事未能如期到京、至前日晚間、始由普陀回滬、甘氏因協定簽字後、卽須發表、故於前晚到滬後、卽於昨日上午七時、由龍華乘中國航空公司飛機趕飛晉京、於昨日上午九時十五分抵南京、卽赴外部補行簽字、（新聲社）</p>
<p>▲全文公布　法領於昨日上午到京補行簽字後、雙方卽於當日下午、將協定全文公布、内中規定、有效期間爲三年、自一九三一年卽民國二十年八月一日起、至民國廿三年七月卅一日止、所有上海法公廨、以及與該公廨有關係之章程條例等、均於該協定之發生效力時起、（卽八月一日）一律作廢、（新聲社）</p>

<p>長江大水、已誌昨報、昨日本埠各輪局、續得漢電、謂水勢更大、災情益重、茲將所聞各節、分記如下、</p>
<p>▲江水續漲　長江水尺、在尋常爲十七至十八英尺、本年最淺時到過十一英尺、今次大雨不止、水勢日夕增漲、二十七日爲四十六尺六寸、已爲前所未聞、詎二十八日、又續漲三尺、其時漢口各馬路、多半淹入水内、不意當夜、再漲兩尺、至昨日已達到五十二尺五寸之水尺、爲長江近六七十年以來所未有之大水也、</p>
<p>▲高棧亦没　前日漢口電告、沿岸水已上街、各輪局所建貨棧、較高者尚未波及、餘均淹没各輪公司正在設法將下層貨出卸、移入高地、詎當天水卽陡漲、至二十八日夜中、高處貨棧、亦全行浸水、貨件受水漬者更多、又以各馬路被水漫浸、交通阻礙、致搶救工作、亦不易設施、</p>
<p>▲上游貨阻　長江來貨在漢口一埠、全持上游各埠、若沙市、宜昌、及長沙、湘潭、與平漢路各埠之貨、轉運到滬、自二十七日起、平漢路聯運貨、已被大水阻斷、無貨裝到、而沙宜等處來貨、亦以不能駁卸、故亦阻停、各江輪之下水貨、驟然減少矣、</p>

<h3>張市長之談話</h3>
<p>▲與蘇省府劈分營業稅</p>
<p>▲中心區二批領地將放</p>
<p>▲希望反日會嚴守紀律</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨爲江蘇省政府要求行政院對於京滬兩市政府之營業稅收入、支配爲省七市三、及市中心區領地等問題、往訪市長張羣、叩以意見如下、</p>
<p>▲營業稅協助　張市長謂、本市奉行政院令、考慮營業稅協解江蘇省政府問題後、業已將礙難補助情形、據理呈復行政院、其所以不能協助之理由有三、其一在行政上上海市政府係一獨立之市政機關、與其他隷屬於省政府者不同、一切市政建設、全在一市收入之中、而全市之發展、亦全在於是、故實際上决無餘力可資協助、其二上海因有租界特殊的關係、其他各省市所有之捐稅、上海市獨未能實行、如前者、市政府擬徵收酒筵捐、亦因格於租界、未能實現、現在市庫所賴以挹注者、仍係以前舊有之稅收、加以整頓、雖似較前略有增加、但市政府將來之一切建設發展、在在需欵、故認爲唯一希望者、卽市營業稅之收入、而市營業稅之收入、究有若干、在未徵收以前、不但不能確定、抑且不能估計、且上海市之稅率、比較其他各省爲低、最高者祇千分之三、將來徵收之時、租界方面之華商、雖皆認識納稅、爲應盡之義務、熱心贊同、然市政府對於租界之華商、亦須顧慮其負擔、蓋租界之華商、不能因對市政府已納營業稅、而可以免納租界之一切雜捐、如最近租界内之旅館業、要求以資本爲徵收標準、市政府亦不能不加以考慮、卽在租界内之外商、將來當然亦在徵收之列、但外商對於其本國政府、亦因盡其相當義務、市政府在此種情形之下、似又應加以體恤、故嗣後市營業稅之收入、因種種特殊情形、其收入若何、尚難預料、其三、取之於民、當用之於民、猶憶在營業稅籌備時、有人謂上海市將來徵收營業稅、華界當然無甚問題、但租界納稅者、祇有納稅之義務、而無權利之獲益、如租界徵收營業稅、應請市政府注意租界納稅人之利益、其言至爲合理、但市政府向例、對於市民利益、從未有將租界市民除外之舉、如教育衞生等無一不予華租兩界市民以同等利益、故將來市政府對於收入之營業稅、取之於民、仍當用之於民、增添學校、及衞生之上之設備、以爲市民謀幸福卽大上海計畫等、亦莫不有賴於此項收入、故對省政府方面之要求、事實上誠爲不可能云云、</p>
<p>▲領地續開放　此次市中心區招領土地八百餘畝、事前曾愼重考慮、以期普遍周密、但萬不料市民之領地、竟如是踴躍、此固市民對於政府信仰之一種好現象、同時余恐無人報領之願慮心、亦一易而爲異常快慰心、在市政府原定辦法、先登記、後抽籤、先抽得者先領、以免爭奪、不料是日經土地局報告、領土地者爭先恐後、並且臨時有人打電話招呼别人至土地局助抽簽、於是余乃臨時决定以帶欵若干、領地若干爲標準、於是不免有人向隅失望、至於上海銀行所領、亦係多數人湊合抽領、並非有其他關係、蓋自此項問題發生後、余曾一度招上海銀行詢問、確不是託辣斯主義、外間所傳、實屬誤會、現市政府對於收入之領地欵項、擬卽用之於市中心區建築幹道溝渠之需、同時將再開放中心區之西北方五百四十畝、其領取辦法、當一反以前之規定、定爲先祇每人領一畝、繼以每人領二畝再至三畝四畝、如此必能免去不普遍之弊矣、</p>
<p>▲對反日態度　繼又談及市民反日援僑會實行扣貨事、略謂對於市民愛國熱情、深表同情、但希望一切舉動、能在法律範圍之内、不越出於軌道之外、能以自尊尊人之人格、作有紀律有秩序之運動云、</p>

<h3>茄勒路血案</h3>
<p>▲周春生中彈慘死</p>
<p>▲似因姦情而仇殺</p>
<p>昨晨六時許、法租界茄勒路光裕里第三十二號門牌後樓房客姑蘇人周春生、忽被暴徒開槍暗殺身死、姘婦胡周氏、同時亦受重創、茲將詳情錄次、</p>
<p>▲分租餘屋　蘇州人喬漢洲、年三十七歲、操成衣業、娶妻郭氏、現年三十四歲、喬天性儉樸、略具積蓄、八年前、租頂法新租界茄勒路光裕里三十二號門牌、自爲二房東、除樓下客堂自已開設喬漢記成衣店外、所有樓上餘屋、均分租與人居住、</p>
<p>▲開燕子窠　喬將前樓租與報販陳錦寳、亭子間租與施姓、尚餘後樓一間、方於本月十四日分賃與蘇州横涇人周春生（三十一號）居住、言定房金每月七元半、周有姘婦胡周氏、（年二十七歲、與周同鄉、）一併遷入、當租屋時、周對二房東聲稱、擬暫行開設燕子窠、再另租小房子住家、</p>
<p>▲狙擊三槍　周與姘婦遷入後、周日出晚歸、氏則終日在家、不越雷池一步、昨晨六時許、周與姘婦正在睡鄉、交頸而眠、樓下店門甫開、學徒正在打掃之際、突來身穿元色香雲紗短衫褲頭戴草帽之暴徒一人、直闖上樓、衝開後樓房門、一見周與氏兩人好夢方酣、竟出手槍、對準床上狙擊三槍、</p>
<p>▲追兇無着　槍聲起處、一彈中周之左太陽穴、一彈中周氏胸前右乳部、氏受傷驚醒、目擊兇手已倉皇下樓圖逃、周氏亟負創追下、同時二房東已從睡夢中驚起、踝足奔出大門、意欲帮同追捕、詎兇手竟返身舉槍向喬恐嚇、喬遂胆怯、不敢再追、兇手乃從容出弄向南朝唐家灣方面逃遁無踪、</p>
<p>▲夫死妻傷　喬回首視周氏胸前鮮血直流、卽僱車送至嵩山路捕房報告、捕頭命令將氏送至仁濟醫院醫治、一面派探往出事地點查勘、周春生因傷在致命處、早已氣絶身死、遂將屍體舁送同仁輔元分堂騐屍所、調查死者滬上並無家屬、旋由法總巡捕房刑事科報請法公廨朱承審官、於下午二時蒞所、騐明已死周春生、委係生前被人暗殺身死、並由包探禀明前情、經問官向二房東訊問一過、遂諭屍身拍照、由堂收殮、候捕房緝兇解究</p>
<p>▲姘婦之言　又據周氏云、前與死者春生本在法租界安納金路一零七號前樓開設燕子窠、刻擬遷至光裕里繼續營業、不料竟出此意外、渠與死者姘識尚未日久、至於兇手其人、頗似素識之同鄉人陳才發、記者調查結果、此案大半起因於姦情、因妒而致仇殺云、</p>

<p>▲以最高價額爲準</p>
<p>▲黄氏財産候調查</p>
<p>上海日夜銀行及大世界游覽儲蓄部倒閉一案、昨日下午法公廨又開庭續訊、先據潘肇邦會計師報告標賣改爲變賣之情形一過、並謂黄氏家屬、前次奉諭派敝會計師等淸算後、由黄氏家屬代理律師譚毅公開單呈報、謂黄氏之不動産與動産、共有數百萬之譜、以動産而論、亦有數十萬、不料及至將貨物交來時、察得所有珍珠、均係極小且黄、至器具等物、共計所値不過數百元、比較譚律師報告之數、大相懸殊、請爲核奪、黄氏家屬代理律師譚毅公請准將前次所判標賣堂諭取消、繼由債權義務代理律師吳經熊之複代理兪承修律師稱、此案涉訟至今、爲日已久、債權方面、僅分得一成之權利、上次奉諭將標賣改爲變賣後、不料發生種種糾紛、互相競登報章、大篇文字、洋洋數千言、此種無謂之爭執、債權方面、甚爲痛心、查黄楚九旣係共發公司董事兼經理、居於當然債務人之地位、前次奉諭淸算後、由伊代理律師譚毅公開具財産單報告、謂黄氏共有財産六百餘萬之巨、各債權人聞之、非常欣慰、不料今據會計師報告、僅値一百七十餘萬、相差四五百萬之巨、且此一百七十餘萬、亦無實數、至此各債權人聞之、又似冷水澆身、大爲掃興、均有不滿、上次堂諭判將標賣改爲變賣、各債權代理人均各贊成、仍求登報競賣、以便早日結束云、又據江一平律師稱、今由敝律師等聞有上次標賣時之得標人、現皆不美於會計師、已在特區法院提起訴訟、請求堂上公函證明兩次標賣、實由公堂主張撤廢、免得會計師因公被陷云、又據朱樹楨律師稱、敝律師亦代表一部份之債權人、現據外面千百人之言、說黄氏家屬、自奉堂諭淸算後、僅將一部份財産交出、尚有大部份財産、隱匿不交、據會計師報告、動産方面、不過交出數百元之首飾、查黄楚九可稱大富之家、何止僅有此區區首飾、請求庭上着令黄氏家屬將大部份財産交出云、又據顔魯卿律師稱、查黄氏家屬、尚有大部份之鑽石等物、抵與他人、請庭上傳案質訊、又有萬春銀團契約之事、有些不明瞭、亦請傳訊、俾早結束、又據各律師互辯良久、龔承審官諭黄氏家屬請求撤消七月十八日堂諭一節、各債權代理律師一致反對、應卽仍照前次堂諭、將兩次標賣撤廢、准由會計師會同各代理律師登報競賣、以最高之價額爲準、再尚有一部份債權代理律師稱、黄氏家屬將財産隱匿情形、着會計師查明呈報、</p>
<h3>譚毅公律師淸理黄楚九財産法律意見書（續）</h3>
<p>（四）關於黄氏債務處理之法律點　查黄楚九之遺債、乃指私人所欠、（如日夜銀行黄楚九戸百餘萬、及其他近二百萬之抵押及來往借貸各項債務、）及經營商業所欠（如共發公司合夥財産不足淸償債務時、應負擔之持分、及其他獨資或合夥所營各業之欠債、）兩項債務而言、計黄楚九私人所欠他人債務、較欠共發公司所屬大世界及日夜銀行等之債額爲數更巨、關於債權債務之承認與否、免除及减讓與否、初非共發公司之淸算人所能處理、以黄氏全部財産備償黄氏全部債務、更未便信託代表債權一部分之共發公司淸算人、單獨爲全部之處分及分配、蓋以黄氏全部遺産、旣經法庭定爲償還其私人及經營商業所負之遺債全部、則售産得價之總額、應照遺債全部之總額、先就有優先權及留置權抵押權者分别予以淸償、嗣就普通債權予以平均分配、日夜銀行大世界之黄楚九戸之欠欵、乃普通債權之一、自應與其他普通債權人同受淸償、而無何種優越之權利、至爲明顯、</p>
<p>（五）關於共發公司債權人代理律師干涉黄楚九遺産處分之法律點　查黄楚九對於共發公司、其地位有二、一、爲股東、二、爲該公司所屬日夜銀行大世界債務人、關於股東資格、應與其他一般股東處同一之地位、在共發公司未經全部結束、尚未證明全夥財産不足淸償以前、自不負任何之責任、至於債務人之地位、其相業之債權人爲共發公司、並非共發公司之債權人、故共發公司之債權人及其代理律師、對於黄氏遺産、本無直接之債權債務關係、對於黄氏遺産、當然無參加過問之權限、况共發公司之淸理事務、早經鈞廨諭派潘吳兩會計師爲淸算人代表其權利、該債權代表律師、如有何種意見及主張、儘可向潘吳兩會計師供獻要求、如認潘吳兩會計師不足以保障共獲公司債權之權利時、亦儘可向鈞廨請求依法救濟、且淸理黄氏遺産與淸理共發公司、截然兩事、共發公司債權代表律師之不能干涉黄氏遺産之淸理、亦等於黄氏私人之債權人、只能向黄氏家屬及黄氏代表律師主張、不能進而干涉共發公司之淸理、易地而觀、彰彰明甚、乃該債權代理律師董俞董熾陳志臯江一平等、或對於投標進行中横加干涉、引起糾紛、或對於鈞廨諭准之投標方法、妄肆批評、請求變更、甚至有謂黄氏遺産旣己交出、黄氏家屬及黄氏代理人不應過問者、其最大之錯誤點、在於視黄楚九卽共發公司、視黄楚九之遺産卽爲共發公司之財産、該律師等是否别有見地、固不敢加以論斷、但該律師等對於淸理黄氏遺産、在法律上無干涉之餘地、可斷言也、</p>
<p>（六）關於吳潘兩會計師派充共發公司淸算人、同時代表法庭保管黄氏遺産、又奉諭會同黄氏家屬代理人處理黄氏遺産之法律點、按潘吳兩會計師爲鈞廨諭派之共發公司淸算人、僅以此種資格、本無干涉黄氏遺産之權、其所以能參預淸理黄氏遺産者、乃由於同時奉派充黄氏遺産保管人、更於三月三十日奉鈞廨堂諭、令該會計師會同妥議辦法、立於監視輔助黄氏淸理之地位、該會計師旣以一個自然人、兼此數種資格、故一般共發公司之債權人、誤認該會計師得以共發公司淸算人之資格、處分黄氏遺産之行爲、遂致引起無謂之糾紛、共發公司與黄氏、本處於債權債務相對待之地位、而共發公司淸算人、應以注重共發公司之利益爲任務、利益旣有偏重、則無形中不免使黄氏家屬及其私人之債權受不利益之影響、觀於該會計師等公告標賣、以共發公司淸算人名義行之、且不與黄氏代理人會同妥議辦法、竟自行呈報法庭及單獨登報、接洽變賣黄氏遺産、以及始終不提及黄氏私人之債務各點、已足證明、茲爲免除誤會昭示大公起見、應請鈞廨將該會計師數項資格撤銷其一二、另行派員接辦、以淸界限而息紛爭、</p>
<p>（七）關於處理黄氏遺産及分償債務之辦法點、按黄氏全部遺産、旣奉諭准淸償全部之債務、爲黄氏家屬計、爲黄氏債權人計、均應早日結束、茲就現在情形、分别擬具辦法如左、（一）不動産、（子）第一次標出之地産、共有六起、内除方單地産所有權、尚待調查、西倉路房地、經審查决定再行標賣外、其餘三處、以白克路九福公司、四馬路杏花樓一葭地産較重大、所得標價、相差不遠、旣經審查確定、並已依法通知得標人、爲維持法庭威信起見、似宜准予投標價額最高者得標、以息訟爭而免枝節、（丑）第一二次投標未經審查確定者、宜准黄氏淸理人、以最高標價登報公開競買、限價須在原標價最高價格以上、如第一次仍不得相當價額、卽再二次登報限價、須在前次出價最高者以上、而以最後出價最高者爲得主、以此公開競賣、庶可增加價值、使債權人多受責益、更足昭示公允而息外界煩言、至登載競賣廣告、須將各地産所有契約關係及其優點詳附說明、引起買主注意、其執行競賣時所有辦法、自應得監視員之同意、（二）處分動産、旣經共發公司淸算人出售一部分、卽仍由該淸算人俟照前定辦法、限價拍賣、其限價數目、須先得黄氏淸理人之同意、（三）處分獨資各商店大部分、前旣由共發公司淸算人盤出、下存部分、仍照舊處理、（四）收支及保管價銀方法、所有全部遺産、旣係陸續出售、所售之欵、由監視員會同黄氏代理人出立收據、存儲於於鈞廨所指定之各銀行、其支票由黄氏淸理人保管支欵圖章二顆、由鈞廨指定之監視員及黄氏淸理人各執其一、必須雙方會章、方能支付、每月終將詳細收支情形、造册報告、並登報公佈、以减輕各方之責任、蓋以欵項進出甚巨、非互相嚴密負責、不足以重、</p>
<p>社會信用也、（五）分償辦法、全部遺産、旣經售價以後、應就黄楚九私人所欠及其經營商業所欠全部債務總數、除有優先權及抵押權留置權者、分别償還外、其餘普通債權、平均攤還、由監視員輔佐黄氏淸理人處理、（六）結束辦法、所有遺産售盡、得價分配各債之後、由法庭指派之監視員及黄氏淸理人、各具一總結之報告書、分呈各法院備案、宣告黄氏淸理結束、其報告書並分送各關係人知悉、其餘毫無價値、不能變賣之物品、（如共發公司股票之類）仍歸還黄氏收存、綜上各點、本律師爲職務關係、未敢緘默、爲特條陳所見、伏乞鈞廨鑒准、迅賜施行、實爲公便、</p>

<h3>紐約職業婦女生活（九）</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>克拉蕾史很快活地吃她中飯、她對於佔得紐約一部份的快樂、决不輕易放過、她是一個眞正的城市女郎、假充據有那全部份、但伊所傾向快樂的爲音樂、羣衆、輕浮與說笑、</p>
<p>她進餐整整費去一個鐘頭、然後很安閑底抽一枝香烟、本來伊不歡喜抽烟、但是伊在一個旅館的慈善賽會裏、看見有許多靑年女子都啣着紙烟、幾乎没有一個女子不吸的、她許多買烟主顧中、許多是婦人、她覺得抽烟是件時髦的事、她並不將烟氣吸進肚去、</p>
<p>飯後伊必須回去工作、這個下午喬治是要來的、喬治是個售貨員、他每星期上這個旅館來、因爲歡喜克拉蕾史、常帶她出去吃飯、他是一個善於化錢的人、可是人家對於他總覺得有些奇性、他講到業務便滔滔不休、但是對於本身的事、很少提及、除了有一次有情感述及他的母親、克拉蕾史想像他必定結婚了、有一次、伊把這話問他、並没有回答、她悟會了這比問還好、</p>
<p>下半天開始的時候、伊就守望着他、他比了許多到旅館裏來的人很有不同之點、他覺得與伊交友非常快樂、可是又不過份的密切、克拉蕾史有時候訴說、攏衆的男子都是相同的、喬治就告訴伊、伊所見的都是他們惡劣的方面、</p>
<p>「這種男子平日大多性情和平、酷愛家庭、要是一到紐約、便像學校裏的小孩子一般、遇到放假日子、一定要有點舉動纔好」、</p>
<p>最後、喬治從大的旋轉門裏進來了、他把所帶的行囊給侍者、然後直趨克拉蕾史所站在的地方、他看上去眞實的歡喜見伊、他說、他們在七點鐘時叙餐、</p>
<p>克拉蕾史對於這天餘剩的時光、覺得很是愉快、她對待顧客也很喜悅、使得顧客們感到、伊似乎對於職務非常愉樂的樣子、到了六點半鐘、伊没有事了、現在伊覺得願意把那件黑縐紗的衣服買來、那件衣服的代價、要十九元七角半、這個數目比了她平時所穿的衣服要貴上五元、不過無論如何、伊的頭髮燙得鬈鬈的總是很可愛、伊每星期燙髮一次、代價一元半、伊覺得這是很合算的、</p>
<p>她和喬治在隣近的旅館穿堂裏相會、因爲在自己工作的旅館裏見他、這件事不很妥當、</p>
<p>「你有趣的面孔」喬治說、「我們到那裏去吃飯呢」、</p>
<p>「隨便那裏、你說罷、」伊回答道、伊曉得、「有趣得面孔」一語、是喬治對於她的一點愛慕、</p>
<p>「到加利福尼亞漫游餐店去如何」、</p>
<p>「啊、喬治、好極了、」這地方離市略遠、眞是一個優越的境地、有美妙的音樂、幽雅的景色、和上好的食品、從城裏去要坐一程汽車、在克拉蕾史看起來、很覺奢侈、此外與喬治坐在一輛車子裏、也没有不好的地方、</p>
<p>兩人在車子裏所講的、無非是些不重要的笑談、克拉蕾史很善於辯駁、約略半小時之後、他們到目的地了、一個看門人怱促地走到車子旁邊、克拉蕾史對於這種小注意地方、怎樣的高興呀、一天到晚、伊在旅館穿堂裏、只見别人享受這種恭維、現在呢、伊居然自己承受了、伊還把望他們穿着晚禮服接她、伊有一件鑲綴珠邊的衣服在家裏、還有一塊淡色的圍巾、那顔色在這種天氣的時候、實在太淡了、但是伊覺得如果著在身上、也很可喜、</p>
<p>他們在跳舞圈邊頭揀了一張兩人桌坐下、克拉蕾史在音樂中間輕輕的摇曳着、她喊了許多嘉肴、啊、她也知道怎樣裝成命婦的樣子、她和喬治起來跳舞、把眼睛溜到别的桌子上、看看有没有人注意她、伊感到很是喜悅、因爲確乎有人注意着她、伊心中小鹿撞心、一起一落、這眞是所謂生命了、</p>
<p>到了十一點半點鐘、喬治提議他們應該回家了、克拉蕾史回過頭來笑說、「是的、在這等得太長久也不很好」、</p>
<p>在回去的車子裏、克拉蕾史踡曲了身子傾向喬治、要受到伊的保護、他可是並不遷就於伊、</p>
<p>「孩子、晚安、」這是他的告别之詞、伊到了房間裏、就將鞋子脫去、不知道怎樣去消磨那未過去的夜晚、她心裏想、將她在這個時候帶回家來、其實夜還未深、啊、天哪、男子們對待克拉蕾史好像是笑話的資料、或者只顯得小的友誼、當然伊不要粗魯的伴侣、但是伊要喬治在叙餐跳舞之外、另外給伊些東西、伊要與喬治那樣的人結婚、他們對伊却没有提起婚姻的事、哦、她僅僅是個售烟女郎、</p>
<p>因爲伊覺得不快活、又因爲伊不使自己安樂、伊就脫去了衣服鑽到被裏去、伊眞恨在伊同伴尚未返來的時候、已經老早回家了、（未完）</p>

<p>據東報載、日英兩國之紗業競爭、自英國東方紗業視察團回國、協議對策以來、益展開於中國印度南洋各地、最近英國之某某兩社在蘭貢出售人造絲織物甚夥、其中之一社得印度帝國銀行之後援、利用殖民地特殊銀行之地位、同時依於深刻之不景氣、乘一般交易條件苛酷、採用長期結賬方法、並因英國紗業貶挹售價、輪船减輕運費、向遠東各地謀免稅進出、一方日本紡織公司因與抗衡從事運費減輕運動、或謀設日英印通商聯盟等、密籌應付、尤其鐘·日本·東洋·富士各紗廠、專意矯正旣得市塲交易上之缺陷、整理金融、更謀市塲之擴大、於中國安南海峽殖民地印度緬甸等主要商港、設置交易市塲、與行家訂託售契約、以謀交易之圓滑、此後日英紗業競爭將益趨熱烈、</p>

<h3>劉三爺</h3>
<p>— 李椿森</p>
<p>—學校劇本第一集—</p>
<p>顧仲彝編</p>
<p>學校劇運動在本年誠有進展、不論大中學差不多都有學校劇團的産生、在那剛纔過去的二十年度上半期整個戲劇運動的生命、簡直祗有學校劇團的小規模的公演在支撑着了、簡直除了一般靑年學生稍爲獻劇藝術的園地從事墾殖外、大多數人是心灰意懶了、像這種戲劇運動本身不健全的厄運、實非重貫以年靑爲新的汁素不可、劉三爺的作者在序論也說、</p>
<p>中國的戲劇運動在最近的風雨颻搖的時代裏、時沉時現的不可捉摸、前途茫茫、不能不使努力的人有心灰的、有消極的、有坐待的、有轉變的、多少人的心血、幾十年的經營、到現在社會上還依舊高捧着梅蘭芳馬連良等等演的舊戲、新劇的前途、照例是「無可樂觀、」新劇的勢運、仍然是「命途多舛」、</p>
<p>這樣看來、在他自己本人當然是碰過釘子的過來人了、他所没有絶望的、只有對於學校劇運動感到興趣、且看作者說、</p>
<p>不過、也不能說完全没有成績、學校劇的勃興是件不可掩飾的事實、是幾十年來戲運動的唯一成就、這點點成就培養在朝氣盪漾善應善變的學生中間、也正反映出將來中國戲劇運動的最後成功、荒蕪磽瘠的中國社會照牠現在的情况、要牠培養出鮮妍光輝的藝術之花、恐怕是毫無希望、學校的園地雖小、但豐盛肥活、大有興展的可能、所以我們提倡學校劇運動就是間接促進整個的新劇運動、在社會未能立時建功樹業、我們先在學校裏下個基礎吧、我們不用失望、不必沮喪、不可徬徨、大家到學校來墾殖吧、</p>
<p>的確、靑年學生接受戲劇藝術的時期最早、而今後的成就當也必有賴他們、</p>
<p>顧先生苦心孤詣、有學校劇本第一集的問世、這末始不是學校劇運動前途發皇的徵兆啊、</p>
<p>本集共包含五篇短劇、除「劉三爺」是創作外、「皆大勝利」、「七尊菩薩」、「門外漢」、「我愛天亮了」四篇、都是改譯的、其各集編製方法、據編者在序裏說、</p>
<p>「材料方面、形形色色、務求廣博、使能適立各種特殊的學校、團體和角色、文體方面、務求淺顯、易於上口、易於明瞭、編訂方面、本擬譯作各半、但編者限於創作的時間太少、不能不多取外國現存的材料、加以改削增補、變成具體的中國戲、有時原作太好了、編者不願牽强改譯、就按牠一字一句直譯下來、以保存牠原有的格調風韻爲規律、</p>
<p>劉三爺是描寫的一個看重友誼的人物、開塲是先使出一個頑皮兒童的縮影、這便是劉三爺的兒子光祖、在門前無聊地踱步、適巧他父親的朋友鄭二麻子因在營裏殺死了一個混賬的營長、纔逃出來、此刻後面有追兵、但鄭麻子已吃了一槍、弄得飢疲交迫、滿口爲到劉三爺的家裏可得有救、豈知他爲了曾在老劉面前說過光祖的話、於是光祖開他的玩笑了、一味奸滑、不給藏起、卽曉以大義、也不能感動、最後是給了二枚銀的好處、才收拾好、不一會追兵來了、詢問他鄭二麻子的踪跡、可是光祖仍是開玩笑地回答、雖受威迫、都依舊坦然、一若無事、後來排長施以利誘的方法、送他一只銀錶作代價、結果是成功、但當剛捆好鄭二麻子的時候、劉三爺夫婦二人回來了、他知道了這事的底細、早已面有慚色、及鄭二麻子駡「大丈夫死不足惜、只不要做賣朋友的奸賊」其内心衝突眞達於極度、待他們一行人走了、就開始做光祖、任他怎樣求饒、終於畢命於劉三爺的槍下、</p>
<p>講到劉三爺的性格、眞完全是一種江湖英雄的本色、看他的說話、</p>
<p>「我的祖父劉太公做到三省的提督、因爲搭救江湖上幾個朋友落草做强盜、我父親爲了弟兄們的義氣、甘心受砍腰的絶刑、我罷、誰不知道我劉三爺的大名爲的是我一向把朋友放在前頭、把私情放在後面、好啦、好啦、你把我劉三爺臉都丢盡了、你是我劉氏門中第一個忘因無義的奸賊、活着也是替祖宗丢臉、」（二一）頁「皆大勝利」是叙一幕夫婦吵架的玩意兒、這裏的登塲人物正是兩對夫婦、葛道存和吳松珍、陶嗣藩和唐藴和、藴和覺得在很愛他丈夫的時候，便什麽事情都苛求的非常認眞、及後知道了丈夫並非神仙、有做不到的地方、就不斷的和他吵架、後來又爲避免吵架起見、就用手段、一切事都順他、只是愛情已從窗裏飛了出去、這次松珍和她丈夫在藴和家裏玩、不道竟和丈夫吵得哭哭啼啼、藴和就拿就這個法寳來傳授給松珍、松珍也照了、藴和的話做了、但她可不興、竟完全說穿了哩、當道存去告訴了嗣藩、他又要逼她跟他吵架、因爲這樣才能得眞愛情、豈知吵架的動機逗引不起、他無法、只得拿姘頭的事來威脅她、到底是她失敗、於是爲了小小的事、又由認眞而吵架了、到這裏就幕落、</p>
<p>這似乎是一篇御妻術、實在愛情這個東西眞難措置極了、一般人都認婚後的愛情是很不易維持的、這話在本劇裏便是主旨了、這是根據Ｌda　Lubleshi　Ehjlich　的Ｗinners　All至改譯成的、</p>
<p>「七尊菩薩」是三幕劇、寫七個乞丐裝七尊菩薩的一回事、因爲他們没有生意、看到瑪瑪山的綠色的山石上雕着的七尊菩薩、大受過路人的敬拜、便來利用了、他們去偷了三件綠色的繡袍、各自裝扮起來、並先到市上宣傳、說在什麽老的古典裏有段預言、那瑪瑪山上的七尊菩薩是要裝了人進城來、結果他們成功了、市民敬拜到極度、一切從未吃到過了東西、現在都吃到了、但終不能消釋市民的懷疑、市民派人去瑪瑪山調查、然而正當他們做夢也做不到的時候、山上的眞菩薩來了、把七個乞丐都點化了、等市民發覺他們的身體已經冷裏、却又以爲是因爲懷疑之故、才使菩薩變了石頭、這是表示世人的崇拜的愚蠢、這劇的原作者是Ｌord　Dunsany的Ｇods　of　theMontain、</p>
<p>「門外漢」是描寫一個做丈夫的鮑八爺、因爲妻子有外遇、發生一種非常的煩燥和納悶的情狀、其中穿揷了大博士的滑稽、這裏的人物都是不澈底的、鮑八爺在開塲的獨白、正是全劇的總歸結、</p>
<p>「是世界上男子中間最不幸的人、我有個老婆眞把我麻煩死了、她不但不能料理家務把家裏弄得淸淸楚楚舒舒服服的、使我喜歡、並且害我每天要發二十次脾氣、她幾天的不在家、在外面到處亂跑、吃大菜、坐汽車、跟那些不三不四的朋友來往、唉、可憐的鮑八爺你是多麽可憐的丈夫啊、但是我總得收拾收拾她、如果我把她殺了、……這不成、那我將來的性命也不保、如果把他關在監牢哩吧、……也不成、這個騷東西會想法逃出來的……眞糟透啦、怎麽辦纔好、……」（一○九頁）</p>
<p>此劇乃根據莫利哀的Ｔhe　Tsalonwyof　he　Barbouille、並參加中國材料、</p>
<p>「我愛天亮了」、是寫一幕少年和少女的怎樣地對於愛情視同玩物、他們原是一對親蜜的情侣、但不料給那偶遇的詩人和婦人而發生裂痕了、少女對那詩人是一見傾心、少年對那婦人也是同樣熱烈的慕戀、從此他們以爲彷彿就該各走各的路了、他們都感到一種新的興奮、較諸前者是更獲有生之意義、但他們不到一星期又馬上變化了、他們識破了詩人和婦人的惡作劇、於是又言歸於好、這裏穿揷了一個補鞋匠、每塲都有他的踪跡、而且每塲裏都有這樣一首歌、</p>
<p>「愛情與我都很好、」</p>
<p>直到一天（命）鶆了、——</p>
<p>旣美且勇又自由、——</p>
<p>我愛與我就糟糕、」</p>
<p>他的說話、一舉一動、都是可愛的、他好像善教訓的老師呢、現代的靑年都在要求愛、他們幻想着美滿的夢境、然而當得到了愛以後、却又會感到不滿足的、結果是閙出無聊的枝節、這種通常的病態、本劇暗示得很有力、此劇是根據ＡdelaideC·Ｒowol的一篇短劇改譯成、</p>
<p>綜這裏改譯的四個短劇、當然是有相當成就的、但不能說完全無疵、正唯這些劇本並無多大的特色、情節很簡單、而且就思想技巧論、也有値得商量的地方至於各種優點、那當然也是很多、不過此刻是不想談到了、</p>
<p>劇本的内容大略地說了、那末我們拿此書來獻與各校的劇團、這在我個人是尚認爲不能十分滿意的、上面已說過、我們的劇本是要適應靑年學生的特殊環境、本集中的五個短劇、除「劉三爺」和　「我愛天亮了」尚有一部份的可取外、「皆大勝利」、「七尊菩薩」和「門外漢」三劇、如果在舞臺出演的時候、我相信一定有濃重的低徊趣味、而在學校劇方面、似乎不甚需要、希望在以後的九集中能多作時代的學校劇本、這是我們盼禱着的、</p>
<p>末了借作者序理的話、作爲本文的結束、</p>
<p>「戲劇運動本是許多人合作纔能興辦的事業、而草創的最平民化的學校劇運動、更需要一般赤膽忠心的扶助者、……我們大家來努力、墾殖</p>
<p>、灌溉、扶養這小小的一朶藝術之花罷」、</p>

After repeated consideration, I am filled with admiration. I estimate that the country has suffered years of chaos and disorder, its vitality is exhausted, and foreign aggression and internal worries are incessant. At this time, anyone with a sense of humanity would not engage in internal conflict. However, just as the Red Scourge was about to be eradicated, traitors seized the opportunity to revolt. Such depravity and disregard for the nation should be met with a determined and thorough suppression. If weeds are not removed, good seedlings cannot flourish; if obstacles are not cleared, the foundation of the nation cannot be laid. Strive and fight, now is the time.

The selection of judges, clerks, translators, and prison staff was formally appointed by the ministry on the 29th and provided with receiving documents. Due to time constraints, specialists were dispatched to Shanghai to begin preparations. Also, the Shanghai French Concession will be received by Yang Zhaoyun on the 31st, and the formal reorganization will be established on August 1st. Because the State Council Printing Bureau couldn't produce new court seals in time, the Ministry of Justice temporarily made four wooden seals, one each for the High Third Branch and the Public Prosecutor, and one each for the Second Special District Court and the Public Prosecutor, which have been handed over to the dispatched commissioners for carrying to Shanghai. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The president, chief judge, chief prosecutor, judge, and clerk of the two new courts of the Shanghai French Concession, as well as the warden of the prison and the director of the detention center of the Second Special District Local Court, have been appointed separately by the Ministry of Law and can be formally announced on the 30th. Also, because the scope of the French Concession is relatively narrow, the organization of the two courts is slightly smaller than the special district court of the Public Concession. The presidents of the two courts will also serve as chief judges. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Mo Dehui Urges Special Commissioners to Go to Russia</h3>
<p>Road Redemption and Trade Restoration Issues Not Yet Discussed</p>
<p>(Harbin) Mo Dehui recently telegraphed the Central Government and the Liaoning authorities from Moscow, urging the special commissioners of the Sino-Soviet Conference to go to Russia as soon as possible. It is heard that Qian Tai, Tu Wei-tseng, and Wang Tseng-si, the three special commissioners, will depart soon after receiving Mo's telegram. Tu is currently in Harbin and recently met with journalists, stating that the Sino-Soviet Conference has held fourteen meetings up to the 14th. The Chinese representative's proposal for road redemption is based entirely on the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian agreements. However, because the representatives of the Soviet Russian government are unwilling to restrict each other, it is difficult for both sides to reach a consensus. For the sake of saving time, it has been decided to continue discussing the East Road management issue. As for the fundamental road redemption plan, it has indeed been discussed. The approximate amount raised by the Chinese representative is about US$200 million, while the Russian representative said that the road redemption value must be between US$250 million and US$300 million. However, neither party has put forward a precise figure. The Chinese representative also insisted that the Russian side should also consider the losses suffered by Chinese due to the robberies in the road redemption plan. As for the issue of restoring trade, it is complex due to the different commercial systems of China and the Soviet Union, and it has not yet been discussed at this time. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Actively Creating Production (3)</h3>
<p>The way to create production. The summary has already been revealed in yesterday's commentary. However, "Knowing is not difficult, acting is." Implementing this path is indeed not easy to say.</p>
<p>Why do I say this? The practical execution of being active, places the greatest emphasis on having an active psychology. Active psychology, serves as the driving force of life. With a change of mind, what cannot be done? With a difference of mind, what can be done? The greatness of the power is such. The people of our country are daily living in a country that is weak, poor, but has a large territory and abundant resources. Daily living under the circumstances of foreign goods flooding in, but also foreign forces are pressuring. We should create production, and as to how we should create it, it cannot be said that nobody knows. However, knowing is knowing. However, putting it into action is not possible. This is nothing more than having no active patriotic psychology. Having no active psychology of promoting national goods, to serve as its driving force.</p>
<p>Others aside for now. Today, the majority of students in large and medium-sized cities in our country, and civil servants in various agencies, do not wear Western suits, and among those who do wear Western suits, the materials are not foreign goods. Those occupying their minds are only elegance and fashion. The concept of patriotism does not exist. When purchasing materials, they only ask about the novelty of the patterns. The concept of promoting national goods does not exist. On the contrary, they may even have the idea that domestic goods are definitely not as good as imported goods. Students, young people, and civil servants are the majority of the country. Furthermore, because they manage household affairs, they have a great need for daily consumer goods (such as clothing materials, decorations, etc.). Their purchase of goods has a greater bearing on the rise and fall of national goods. If women across the country could have the active concept of promoting national goods, and always purchase national goods first, then the power they demonstrate in revitalizing national goods, if added statistically, the magnitude of the number, it will be astonishing. Furthermore, the psychology of children is often transferred invisibly due to the behavior and education of parents. If parents have the active concept and actual behavior of loving the country and promoting national goods, then through constant exposure and influence, these countless young citizens will also be able to develop strong patriotic concepts. They all regard buying and using foreign goods as shameful. However, can the women in our country today all have the concept of loving the country and using national goods practically? Today, the loss of rights and interests is left unsaid, and the cultivation of the nation's children lacking patriotic concepts, its harm to the future of our country, cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Therefore, creating production is not difficult, but the difficulty lies in this kind of psychological transformation. The difficulty lies in the vitality of action without urging. If the people of our country all have a strong concept of loving the country and promoting national goods, then with our large territory, abundant resources, and coupled with human power, give me ten years, and the development of our country's industry, we can vouch for it.</p>
<p>The construction of an active patriotic psychology and the concept of promoting national goods, on the one hand, lies in the future awareness of the Chinese people themselves. On the other hand, it is also tied to the government's encouragement and supervision to cultivate a good atmosphere. The reporter believes that from now on, our government should earnestly implement the previously stipulated notification that students, academic staff, uniforms, and other supplies, unless absolutely necessary, must purchase national goods. And encourage women all over the country, to all buy and use national goods.</p>
<p>Foreign goods should be boycotted. And the active boycott is creating production. How can we then carry out creating production? Then it is in the construction of an active patriotic psychology of the people. Now that the people of the country are singing high tunes of rejecting Japanese goods, I humbly offer this idea.</p>

<h3>Important Foreign Telegrams</h3>
<h3>British and German Authorities Exchange Views on Arms Reduction</h3>
<p>Request to Stop Building Pocket Battleships</p>
<p>Will Be Left for the Conference to Consider</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Returns Home by Plane Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 28th. After British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson arrived in Germany, they met with German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius almost constantly. Most of today's discussions concerned proposals for concerted efforts to achieve world arms reduction. It is reported that although the German government is unwilling to make concessions on the request to stop building the second pocket battleship, it has expressed its willingness to leave this issue for consideration at the Arms Reduction Conference next spring. German authorities also solemnly stated their sincerity in wanting the Arms Reduction Conference to achieve the goal of worldwide arms limitation. The British authorities' suggestions are similar to those discussed by US Secretary of State Stimson in Berlin.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 28th. Tonight, British Prime Minister MacDonald hosted a banquet for German Chancellor Brüning at the British Embassy, marking the end of the British delegation's stay in Germany. After the banquet, British Foreign Secretary Henderson drove to Friedrichstrasse, boarded the London express train around 10 o'clock, and headed west. As for the outcome of this British-German meeting, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry today, it mainly discussed how to implement the various resolutions of the London Seven-Nation Conference. Various active methods to alleviate the current commercial depression were also studied. Other issues that were examined included the arms reduction issue and the issue of uniform working hours. The exchange of views between the two countries was very smooth.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 29th. British Prime Minister MacDonald returned to London by plane at 10:00 this morning. German Chancellor Brüning, Foreign Minister Curtius, and the British Ambassador all went to the Tempelhof Airport to see him off. Many Germans were present to bid farewell.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 28th. British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson spoke to reporters in Berlin today about their visit to Germany. MacDonald said that their talks with the German Chancellor, etc., were a continuation of the talks that the German Chancellor, etc., had begun during their previous visit to the United Kingdom, and were part of the continued mutual contact between countries. Mutual contact between countries can dispel existing suspicions, and only in this way can world commerce be revived, financial stability and credit restored, a satisfactory resolution to the arms reduction issue be promoted, and world peace be enhanced. There are currently two actions being taken: first, that those in power should do their best to clear the air; second, that experts should discuss solutions to financial and arms reduction issues. These two actions are now proceeding simultaneously and are expected to be effective. The British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary both said that a psychological change is now gradually becoming apparent. In another half month, there should be better developments. Henderson spoke of the progress of Anglo-German relations and said that the German authorities' visit to Paris had opened a new era in Franco-German relations. This relationship can eventually resolve many outstanding issues. The British Prime Minister, etc., were received by German President Hindenburg this morning and had a friendly conversation for half an hour. The British Prime Minister, etc., were all very pleased.</p>
<p>Stimson Describes His Impression of Visiting Germany</p>
<p>Germans Inevitably Complain Too Much About Poverty</p>
<p>Financial Situation Shows Great Progress</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 20th. Before leaving the European continent for England, US Secretary of State Stimson sent three telegrams from The Hague to German President Hindenburg, Chancellor Brüning, and Foreign Minister Curtius, celebrating Germany's future, predicting the success of Brüning's policies, and expressing his gratitude for the hospitality he received in Germany.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, London, 28th. When US Secretary of State Stimson spoke to the press today, he implied that his impression of visiting Germany was that if the Germans could change their mindset, they could definitely weather the financial and economic crisis and return to prosperity. If we constantly talk about being impoverished, no one will be willing to lend us money. This is true for individuals, and even more so for countries. Therefore, Stimson believes that the Germans complain too much about poverty. He also believes that Germany's crisis is not over, but the situation has improved greatly in recent days. Germany is the only country in Europe that has disarmed, so it has its own reasons for insisting on continuing to build pocket battleships.</p>
<p>▲German President Issues Another Emergency Decree</p>
<p>Restrictions on Bank Withdrawals Slightly Eased</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 28th. Today, the President issued</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>two emergency decrees. The first order requires Germans holding creditor's rights in foreign banks, shops, private individuals, etc., to submit a detailed report to the Ministry of Finance. The second order allows banks to pay out funds to depositors up to a limit of 300 marks, with no restrictions on how the funds are spent. This order has greatly eased the restrictions on bank payments, and it is expected that the banking business will soon return to its original state.</p>
<p>▲British and French Negotiate Commercial Loans</p>
<p>Interrupted Due to Opposition from the British Treasury</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Paris, 28th. Negotiations between the Bank of France and the Bank of England for a loan of 20 million gold pounds have been interrupted today due to opposition from the British Treasury. The reason for the British Treasury's opposition is roughly because the current exchange rate of the pound has exceeded the actual price of gold, which can prevent the outflow of cash from London. According to this, the negotiations were conducted by the presidents of the two banks.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 28th. There is no news in London about the rumor that the Bank of England and the Bank of France have agreed to borrow 20 million pounds. However, a Reuters dispatch from Paris stated that negotiations on Anglo-French financial cooperation have taken on a more substantial form after a meeting at the Bank of France between representatives of the Bank of England and major French financial institutions yesterday. The proposed method is mostly the same as in 1907, that is, Bank of England notes can be rediscounted to French banks, with the Bank of England and the Bank of France providing guarantees. This is purely a commercial transaction and does not require political interference.</p>
<p>▲United Kingdom Recovers Total War Debt</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 28th. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden replied in the House of Commons today to a question about how Allied countries are repaying their debts to the UK, saying that the total debt owed to the UK on the settlement date was approximately 123 million pounds. This does not include the Belgian war debt, which is the responsibility of Germany to compensate according to the Treaty of Versailles, and the Russian war debt, which has not yet been resolved. The Allied countries' war debts to the UK have been settled, and the conditions are equivalent to the abandonment of approximately 65 percent of the debt. Italy is unique, with the amount of abandonment equal to 86 percent. The UK has now recovered a total of 71.23 million pounds in war debts.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Rushes to Build Arms Reduction Conference Venue</h3>
<p>▲Expecting 2,500 Attendees</p>
<p>Poland Refuses to Report Details of Military Preparations</p>
<p>Demanding That the Soviet Union's Military Preparations Be Published First</p>
<p>Relations Between the Two Countries Are Becoming Increasingly Tense</p>
<p>▲Geneva Report, The Arms Reduction Conference initiated by the League of Nations next February is expected to have approximately fifty participating countries, with 2,500 attendees, and will last for half a year. As there is no suitable venue, the League of Nations has rented a garden owned by Americans near the Secretariat, facing the Wilson Memorial Lakeside Road, to build a temporary conference venue. Two large conference rooms, one press correspondent room, two small conference rooms, and other small rooms are being built, with heating, cooling, and hot and cold water. A corridor connects it to the Secretariat for easy office work. The building is made of wood and is suitable for semi-permanent use. After the closing, it is planned to be used for various conferences. The League of Nations' budget for the expenditure of the Arms Reduction Conference is approximately 4 million Swiss francs. (World)</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 28th. The Secretariat of the League of Nations previously requested that all countries participating in the Arms Reduction Conference next year report details of their military preparations. The Polish reply has now been received. Although its contents have not been published, it is reported that the Polish government has declined to report anything and requires that the Soviet government report first, and then the Polish government will follow suit. According to sources in the League of Nations, the Soviet government submitted a detailed list of military preparations to the Secretariat of the League of Nations in May, but agreed that it should not be published before the opening of the Arms Reduction Conference. The Polish government's letter is tantamount to forcing the Soviet Union to publish first. However, relations with the Soviet Union may become increasingly tense as a result.</p>
<h3>Methods to Save Silver's Low Price</h3>
<p>U.S. Senator Advocates Concurrent Use of Silver to Pay Debts</p>
<p>British Parliamentarians Support the Adoption of a Bimetallic Standard</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Buenos Aires, 28th. Although the nature of the plan discussed by Senators Borah and Smoot to save the silver mining industry has not been published, it was stated today that if the silver mining industry is to be saved, an international conference must be convened to consider ways to raise the price of silver, and there is an immediate need to launch it. The two senators did not deny that their plan included the concurrent use of silver to pay international war debts.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 28th. The argument for a bimetallic standard in the correspondence column of The Times is gradually gaining strength. Many Conservative Party members of the House of Commons jointly published a letter supporting the proposal of banker Hunstun to adopt a bimetallic standard. Dalling, the manager of the well-known Midland Bank, also wrote to The Times on this matter, saying that restoring silver to its original status is a tool powerful enough to save the world from its plight. Both letters stated that the world's gold production may not be able to supply enough gold in the next ten years to meet the needs of gold standard countries.</p>
<h3>Spanish Cabinet Resigns, Governance Entrusted to Parliament</h3>

However, it is expected that Parliament will resolve to order it to remain in office and is currently requested to handle government affairs as before. Prime Minister Zamora said when resigning that the government had fortunately consolidated the foundation of the republic and fulfilled its promise to convene Parliament. He also said that the central government and the Barcelona state government were in harmony without gaps, and all kinds of external rumors were not true. However, the regulations for the relationship between the two governments are one of the most important tasks today and have now been entrusted to Parliament.</p>

The flood rushed directly into the Dacheng Embankment and the inner embankment of Chenjiazhou, as well as the Tianding Embankment, the gateway to the river defense of Tonglu and other counties. Both embankments are in imminent danger. The residents are terrified. In the embankments that have not collapsed, the water is also full. Only one or two out of every hundred fields of crops survive. The people in the collapsed embankments have nowhere to live. They are soaked in the rain in groups, crying for food. Their cries shake the fields and are too terrible to bear. We beg you to immediately grant relief funds to benefit these disaster victims. We are most eagerly awaiting your orders. Qian Binghuang, Wang Bingyao, Zhou Bingqing, Liu Chunqian, Wu Bingyao, and Wu Zhongying, leaders of the Eastern Township Finance Bureau of Tongcheng, along with 300,000 disaster victims, kowtow with their seals.</p>

<p>From the above two tables, the occupational status and agricultural situation of Koreans in our Northeast can be seen at a glance. According to the Korean Residents Association, among the more than 7,000 Koreans under its jurisdiction, the majority are agricultural laborers. Others engaged in innkeeping, prostitution, and serving as maids number over 300, while those without any occupation exceed 100. The above table is copied from the Liaoning Korean Residents Association. Their classification of occupations differs from our concept of occupation. What they call "maids" is actually a euphemism for prostitutes, and there is no real difference between them and the prostitutes in brothels. Furthermore, the "other freelancers" and "other employed" listed in the table should be regarded as having no legitimate occupation. Even among those in "commerce and consignment," "medicine," and "employees of various companies," a significant portion may be unemployed idlers, engaged in selling contraband, and other improper businesses. Although this table is a statistical summary of the occupations of Koreans in a part of Liaoning, the occupational distribution of Koreans in other regions is generally the same. As for their agricultural situation, it is truly alarming to us. The paddy and dry rice fields cultivated by them in the three northeastern provinces reach 2,831,870 Fan, equivalent to more than 3,539,830 Chinese Mu. The land that can be used for paddy field cultivation in the future is still 3,416,021 Fan, equivalent to more than 4,270,000 Chinese Mu. The current annual harvest of brown rice is over 940,000 Shi. If further developed in the future, it will surely double. This large amount of food, in addition to being consumed by the local Koreans themselves each year, is mostly shipped to Japan. At a time when our country is facing a shortage of food and the number of starving people is increasing daily, allowing such vast farmlands to be developed and seized by foreigners is a strategic mistake that could not be worse.

<h3>Japanese Essentially Occupying Wanbaoshan</h3>
<p>▲ Local Negotiations Completely Ineffective</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Troops Stationed in Wanbaoshan Continuously Reinforced</p>
<p>▲ Dammed Water Rising, Farmers Appeal</p>
<p>▲ Situation Deteriorating Further</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: Regarding the Wanbaoshan Incident, the central government has considered it a local issue and has not lodged a serious protest with the Japanese side. However, the Japanese side views the occupation of Wanbaoshan as part of their plan to occupy Manchuria and Mongolia. They are therefore pleased that our central government is not paying attention to the Wanbaoshan case and are actively developing their plan. Consequently, they are completely rejecting our side's demands regarding local negotiations. At the same time, they are also increasing troop deployments in the Mashaokou area. In other words, Wanbaoshan is no longer ours. Therefore, all sectors here greatly hope that the central government will lodge a serious protest with the Japanese side regarding the Wanbaoshan case, and not regard the case as entirely separate from the Korean massacre of overseas Chinese, treating it lightly and allowing the cunning schemes of the Japanese to succeed. The following is a record of the recent situation of this case:</p>
<p>▲ Unreasonable Demands from the Japanese Side According to a Japanese reporter in China, negotiations regarding the Wan Incident have stalled due to the stalemate between the two sides. The Chinese side insists that the issue cannot be resolved unless Korean farmers stop working, Japanese police withdraw, and rice paddy leases are terminated. The ultimate concession they are willing to make is limited to compensating the Korean farmers for their losses. The Japanese side demands that the contract between Hao Yongde and the Korean farmers be considered valid and denies the Chinese side's claim for compensation, which is a prerequisite. Ultimately, they insist on allowing Korean farmers to plant rice as agreed, with the ditch embankments occupying some civilian farmland, leasing land according to the contract, and achieving the completion of the farm plan before stopping. Mayor Zhou and the Japanese consul, in addition to formal official protests, have also repeatedly negotiated on this point of contention, with neither side willing to back down. The Chinese side believes that the issue of land sovereignty is of utmost importance, so they will not concede. The Japanese side insists on continuing to fight, not stopping until their goal is achieved, because a long-standing pre-determined plan is now being realized. Since the two sides are moving in opposite directions, a solution may not be easily reached in the short term. It is heard that Japanese officials, after discussions at the consulate, have decided to send Kuramoto to the municipal government to present eight demands orally, followed by a formal official letter. They also decided on a final solution: if the Chinese authorities are willing to compensate the Korean farmers for their losses, the total amount of the Korean farmers' losses will be calculated as compensation for ten years. The lease will also be stipulated to expire in ten years. All rice paddies will be calculated as 500 qing, with each qing yielding a certain amount of rice and wheat each year, and each stone priced at a certain amount of yuan. The compensation for ten years of losses will be calculated based on a very bountiful harvest each year, and the Chinese government will pay it during the autumn harvest. This is one aspect. Another part is the cost of digging trenches and building dams by Korean farmers in the Wanbaoshan Mashaokou rice area this year, as well as the cost of sending Japanese troops to protect them, all calculated in full, and the Chinese side must be responsible for compensating it. This is the second aspect. These two unreasonable demands are the Japanese side's final means of resistance. If Chinese officials can agree, it can also be resolved, they say. These demands are tantamount to seizing our rice paddies by force. Moreover, everyone who is close to the Japanese side says the same thing, which shows the determination of the Japanese to occupy Wanbaoshan Town.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Side Withdraws Police and Reinforces Troops During the Wan Incident, Japanese troops occupied Mashaokou, and armed police officers were transferred one after another. Therefore, the defense of the Japanese concession was insufficient. According to those close to the Japanese, Consul Tashiro is secretly withdrawing some of the Japanese police who were previously dispatched for this reason. However, there are still thirty to forty Japanese police officers left to protect the rice paddies. Fearing that their force is weak, they have specially dispatched two teams of fifteen garrison soldiers each to assist in reinforcement. In addition, there are Japanese plainclothes teams and Korean self-defense militia groups stationed in Mashaokou, totaling no less than one hundred and several dozen troops. The Japanese side also declared that they would dispatch large numbers of troops if necessary. Otherwise, the rumor that the Japanese police team would not be dispatched and that the Japanese Consul-General in Liaoning, Hayashi Hisashi, telegraphed Tashiro to withdraw all police teams stationed in Ma, has not been realized to this day. The secret withdrawals and retreats at night in recent days are purely a contingency plan automatically deployed by the Japanese consul, and not the result of our side's demand for police withdrawal. The garrison team assisting in the defense of Ma departed on the nights of the 19th and 20th. On the surface, it seems to be a partial withdrawal of troops and police, but in reality, it is a substitution, a change of soup but not of medicine.</p>
<p>▲ Flood After the Dam is Built After the Koreans completed the construction of the dam in Mashaokou, the water level rose sharply. The Korean farmers then released water to irrigate their fields. Since the 13th, nearby civilian fields have been flooded, about 250 to 260 hectares. From the 18th to the 19th and 20th, there were continuous heavy rains and hailstorms in the Jilin-Changchun area. The Yitong River flooded, and torrents of mountain water surged down, overflowing both banks. According to representatives of Chinese farmers from Guanhuang Guantun, Sanxingtun, Jiangjiawobao, Huajiaqiao, and Liangyimen downstream—Jiang Hongshan, Liu Changjiang, Ma Zhenqing, Tian Jun, and Gong De—who came to Changchun on the 20th to report to the county government and the municipal government, the Yitong River water level gradually rose after the Korean farmers built the dam, with the deepest part a few inches from the bank. In recent days, rain and hail have alternated, and the river water has overflowed, breaking the dam in the middle of the stream, causing flooding on both banks. The area of civilian fields flooded upstream and downstream has now reached 1,500 to 1,600 hectares. If there is another heavy rain, the crops on the sloping 5,000 to 6,000 hectares of land will inevitably be destroyed. If the dam is removed, the water level will drop immediately. If proper prevention and removal of the dam are not carried out, the civilian fields along the river will become a swamp, and the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of farmers will be washed away. The autumn harvest is already half hopeless, they said. Mayor Zhou and County Magistrate Ma, after receiving the report, have decided to lodge a protest, demanding that the Japanese consul quickly order the Korean farmers to remove the dam.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Rescue Koreans Due to the lack of food, the Korean farmers in Mashaokou are quite panic-stricken. Korean laborers are given a full meal of rice per day, and the rest eat porridge in the morning and evening. Consul Tashiro therefore specially ordered Tokusuke Shimotoku, the chairman of the Wan Incident Support Association for Japanese citizens in Tougou, to convene a committee meeting to discuss relief measures. The meeting was held on the 19th. The chairman of the Veterans Association, Shiido; the chairman of the local committee, Kazuki; the chairman of the Residents Association, Tanaka; the chairman of the Autonomous League, Hakoda; the chairman of the Youth Federation, Ozawa; and the police chief, Takenami; and the chief of the consulate, Kuramoto, all attended. They decided to raise funds for relief and purchase and transport food. Shimotoku, Shiido, Tanaka, Hakoda, and Takenami are responsible for handling the matter. The fundraising methods are: (1) Japanese and Korean merchants and citizens, regardless of gender, age, or youth, donate a voluntary donation of 20 sen of Japanese yen per person per month, which is paid monthly. Shimotoku, Shiido, and others, in conjunction with the Japanese police, solicit donations from house to house. (2) Free donations should be submitted to the North Manchuria Daily, the Business News, and the Asahi Shimbun branch, and transferred to the Support Association to purchase food and transport it to Mashaokou, where it is distributed by the director of the Inada Japanese Police Station, Nakagawa. It is currently heard that they are temporarily raising 3,000 yen of Japanese money for relief. If it is not enough, they will continue to raise funds. (22nd)</p>
<h3>An Observation Journal of Pyongyang</h3>
<p>▲ The Current State of Overseas Chinese in Pyongyang Your reporter departed from Andong at 9:30 PM on July 22nd and arrived in Pyongyang at 3:30 AM on the 23rd. Upon disembarking from the train, a criminal detective from the Government-General of Korea was there to protect him, claiming that he was there to protect him under orders from his superiors. When asked how he knew the reporter was coming, he smiled and did not answer, only taking his leave after the reporter had checked into the Sanken-shi Inn. At 8:00 AM, the reporter was still asleep when he was suddenly awakened by someone calling out, identifying himself as Han Pei-chang.</p>

<p>A Shandong native, manager of the Taikwan Foreign Firm in Pyongyang, because he heard people at the Inn talking, and that three Chinese have checked into this inn, hence the visit to inquire, after revealing my place of origin, he detailed the horrific events that happened in Pyongyang, that the Taian Foreign Firm was established by an American, and he has been the manager for 24 years, his whole family resided here, had a 76 year old mother, with his wife and 7 children. Now the firm has been completely destroyed by Koreans, his personal savings of decades has been completely destroyed, a daughter aged 14, due to shock and fright, died in hospital. Thankfully, his elderly mother is still healthy and sound. He teared up as he spoke, choking with emotions. The reporter felt a great sorrow, his eyes welling with tears. Around 10:00 AM, the head of the Pyongyang Chinese Business Association, Meng Xianshi, the permanent committee members, Liu Ziping and Wang Zichen, came after hearing the news to visit. They discussed in great detail the causes and the details of the damages suffered, they said that there were originally seven thousand Chinese overseas, most have since fled back to their country after the incident, currently residing in Pyongyang City are about two hundred odd people, residing in the countryside, about two hundred odd people, in hospital there are fifty odd people, calculating men and women, there were fewer than 600 people. From July 6th onwards, the Japanese police had sent them to live in temporary shelters, until the 18th, did they begin to leave the shelters one after another. The Japanese official shelters, until the 20th it closed down. The leaving overseas Chinese, by the Japanese police were instructed to live in 5 places, in the city, there were 4 places, (1) residing in Qian Hesheng, there were 60 people, of which, there were 2 women, the men were all businessmen (2) residing in Dong Shenglou, there were 28 people, all were counter staff from restaurants (3) residing in Hong Shenglou, there were 85 people, of which there were 4 women, the men were all shops</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Two, Three and Four designation, aside from that, there were vegetable garden workers, about two hundred odd people, working in the countryside, and every night resided in one location, by the Japanese police for protection, all the overseas Chinese, daily resided at the shelters, daring not to go out, those that had matters and had to go out, dared not to go far, some disguised themselves as Japanese Koreans, and that might be able to avoid it, otherwise, walking on lonely and secluded places, still could not avoid being sniped at by Koreans. Minister Wang Rongbao, recently arrived in Pyongyang, and negotiated with the Japanese authorities, and requested protection from the Japanese authorities, and asked all overseas Chinese, to visit the various debtor residences, and audit and reconcile the debts, and retrieve the debts. However, the Koreans already knew that the overseas Chinese books have been destroyed, and cunningly refused to pay, as for the various shops, all were destroyed beyond recognition, difficult to recover, aside from Hong Shenglou restaurant, as the damage was more slight, and has voluntarily sought to resume business, all the other 300 odd large and small shops, had no hope of resuming business.</p>
<p>▲ A Visit to the Hospital At 11:30, Fujida Katsusaburo, the industry head of Pyongyang City Hall, and patrolman Mori Ogahiro, arrived at the hotel, claiming to be there to protect us under orders, and asked permission to follow us everywhere. Although we knew they were monitoring us, we had no way to refuse, so we went with them to the Pingnam Provincial Hall and Pyongyang City Hall to pay our respects to Governor Sonoda Hiroshi and Oshima Yoshi, and at 12:00 we went to the Pyongyang Shih Hospital to visit the overseas Chinese compatriots who were recovering in the hospital. The hospital had accommodated 110 injured overseas Chinese after the incident, including 8 women. 18 people died after being admitted to the hospital, including 4 women. After treatment, 50 odd people were discharged from the hospital, and there are currently 41 men and 4 women in the hospital. This was all said by the hospital director. When asked to see the list of casualties, he claimed that it had been sent to the provincial hall and was not kept in the hospital. The overseas Chinese were living in the lowest-grade third-class rooms in the hospital. The mats were broken and the rooms were dirty. Each room accommodated seven or eight people, and the air was extremely turbid. Each person was wrapped in dirty and old bandages. This proves that the hospital is not doing its best to treat the wounded. The wounds of each injured person were all on the head, wrists, arms, legs, etc. One overseas Chinese compatriot had wounds all over his body, and his left eye was covered by a bandage. He was lying on the ground moaning incessantly. A fellow injured person in the same room said that his left eye was broken and he was already blind. He had been injured for many days and had not yet recovered. The other injured people were also lying on the ground crying in pain. It was unbearable to hear their voices and unbearable to see their condition. The reporter intended to take a photo, but as soon as the light was adjusted, the Japanese hospital director sternly stopped him, saying that photography was not allowed here. Therefore, such a tragic scene could not be captured in a photo to report to the people of the country. Among the women recovering, there was one, Madam Zhu Li, who cried when she saw the reporter, recounting that her husband had been beaten to death, and an eight-year-old son had also been killed. Only she and her three-year-old son remained in her arms. The reporter listened to her account and wanted to find a word of comfort, but he didn't know what to do. Since entering the hospital, the overseas Chinese had not seen a single relative or friend for nearly a month. Knowing that the reporter was Chinese, they were all moved to tears and wanted to pour out their grievances, but the hospital director repeatedly stopped them from talking, and urged them to leave quickly on the grounds that other Japanese and Korean patients in the hospital hated the noise. Reluctantly, they left the hospital with tears in their eyes. Walking in the courtyard, they still saw the injured overseas Chinese compatriots watching from the windows, each with tears in their eyes, looking longingly. At that moment, the reporter's brain was filled with hot blood, and his head was dizzy. He didn't know whether he felt sour or bitter.</p>
<p>▲ Graves of Overseas Chinese Compatriots Who Died Tragically After leaving the Pyongyang Hospital, we went to the fake tombs of the overseas Chinese compatriots who died tragically outside the city. The place is at the foot of Changshan Mountain in the Datong Hall, more than ten miles from Pyongyang City. Driving, we saw five burnt vegetable gardens and houses by the roadside. Broken bricks and tiles were everywhere. In particular, a vermicelli workshop was burned the most tragically. Only a dozen broken beams and broken pillars, and two unburned brick chimneys remained on the ground. Generally, Korean women, old and young,</p>
<h3>Condition After Destruction of Vegetable Gardens in the Countryside of Pyongyang</h3>
<p>They were squatting in the vegetable gardens, searching for fruits and vegetables. These people have simple minds and do not know that they are being used. After an hour, we arrived at the fake tomb. The tombs of the 95 people who died, as they are called, are just five large ridges of earth, with an incense table and two wreaths from the mayor in front. There are four soil pits, three zhang long and one zhang and three chi wide, and one soil pit two zhang long, with the same width. According to Fujida, who guided us, each soil pit contains 20 people, and the smaller ones contain 15 people, for a total of 95 people. Before burial, the provincial hall compiled numbers and kept a clear list of faces for a year, so that the Chinese side could check later. A numbered stake was placed in front of the body to match the list of faces. However, according to the reporter's measurements, each pit contains at least 35 or 6 people, and the five pits together contain more than 160 or 70 people. We took a photo and waited to develop and map it when we returned. Later, we offered incense and paid our respects with our companions, and after a half-day of mourning, we returned to the city.</p>
<p>▲ Inspection of Destroyed Shops The shops of overseas Chinese were mostly destroyed in the Korean residential area, and the Japanese residential area was less damaged. In silk shops such as Qian Hesheng and Yong Qingde, doors and windows were broken, and goods that were of good quality and valuable were looted, while those of poor quality were torn into thin strips and trampled on. In the case of Qian Hexiang, about 100 bolts of linen and ramie cloth were torn. The rest of the halls, such as Donghua Yuan, were the most severely damaged. The furniture upstairs and downstairs was not intact, and even the doors, windows, and walls were torn to pieces. Among the destroyed shops, this number was the most serious. In the Yong Sheng Gong ironware factory, the boilers and other items stored were destroyed by hammers and axes. Fortunately, the factory cast its own products, and the raw materials were still available. With some work, they could still be made into objects. The walls and roofs of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce were all uncovered and broken.</p>
<h3>Condition After Destruction of the Taiyuan Restaurant, a Chinese Restaurant in Pyongyang</h3>
<p>For now, the broken house of Qian Hexiang is used as a temporary office, temporarily handling the investigation of the deaths of overseas Chinese. Because most of the staff are managers and shareholders of the destroyed shops, they are not in the mood to work after the disaster. Therefore, the Beijing Chinese Chamber of Commerce specially sent Zhou Zhaogao, Wang Gongwen, Zhang Youfang, Liu Shoufu, and Zhou Baoshan, and Zhao Zhongxuan and Wang Minghao from Incheon, to help with the aftermath. The reporter also visited each temporary shelter for a week. Each shelter was guarded by a Japanese policeman to prevent accidents. The displaced masses did not go out into the streets unless they had to. It can be said that there were no traces of overseas Chinese. The official Sonoda Hiroshi gave each deceased overseas Chinese compatriot a consolation fee of 500 yen (Japanese money), which was received by the family members of the deceased and certified by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. The injured were given 50 yuan. So far, 29 people have received the consolation fee for tragic deaths, and about 50 odd people have received the injury fee.</p>
<p>▲ A Conversation with the Governor Pyongyang belongs to Pingnam Province. The governor of the province is equal to the Tao Yin in our country, but the powers of police, education, finance, and municipal administration all belong to him. The Japanese who accompanied him insisted on seeing Governor Sonoda Hiroshi and Oshima Yoshi, the mayor of Pyongyang (equivalent to the mayor of our country). The reporter asked about the handling of the aftermath of the overseas Chinese. Sonoda Hiroshi said that this incident was sudden and he regretted not being able to prevent it. There is no definite number of overseas Chinese in Pyongyang, about 6,000 people. At the time of the incident, they were protected by the police and sent to a temporary shelter, which housed more than 5,000 people. To prepare food and lodging, a large team of police was dispatched to protect them day and night. Those who returned to Shandong were sent to Zhennampo free of charge to take a sea ship. The provincial hall also sent a few yuan for pocket money. The shelter was closed on the 20th, and the remaining overseas Chinese were taken over by the Chamber of Commerce. The provincial hall gave them ten days of food. Those who had debts with the outside world, although the account books were damaged, have been instructed to check with each other to resolve the debts. The provincial hall will try to make it easy to resolve. Mayor Oshima Yoshi has less responsibility for the tragedy, so he only spoke with modesty. (Sent from Keijo on the 25th)</p>
<h3>The Water Level of the Canal Continues to Rise, the Jiangsu Provincial Government Decides to Open the Cheluo Dam</h3>
<p>▲ Earth will be opened twice when it reaches one zhang, seven chi, and three cun.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The water level of the Jiangbei border river in Jiangsu Province has continued to rise in the past two days. According to reports from the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, the water level at Gaoyou Yumato rose two cun before noon on the 27th, with a water level of one zhang, six chi, and seven cun, and another cun in the afternoon, with a water level of one zhang, six chi, and eight cun. On the morning of the 28th, it continued to rise by two cun, and the water level reached one zhang, seven chi, which is almost the same as the size of the Guihai Dam that was opened in 1921. Sun Hongzhe, the director of the Construction Department, considered the situation serious and specially proposed to the provincial government to consider the public opinion and water level and approve the appropriate size for opening the dam. The provincial government decided yesterday that when the water level reaches one zhang, seven chi, and three cun, the Cheluo Dam will be opened in two stages. Half of it will be opened first, and if the water continues to rise, the other half will be opened. The Construction Department has telegraphed Director Mao and Section Chief Qian, who are stationed in Gaoyou, to inform them. The water level in Yaowan fell by six points and six centimeters yesterday, but the water level is still 17.93 meters. If Bengbu can also fall like this and does not continue to rise, the Guihai Dam may not need to be fully opened.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Department Relieves the Silkworm Famine</h3>
<p>▲ Advocating Autumn Silkworm Breeding and Increasing the Number of Guidance Centers</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: Jiangsu Province suffered from poor spring silkworm breeding this year due to the influence of the weather, and the rural economy suffered heavy losses. If we do not make every effort to promote autumn silkworm breeding, it will not be enough to make up for the losses. In view of this, the Agricultural Department, in addition to the 50 odd autumn silkworm guidance centers attached to the various county fields, has also joined the China United Sericulture Improvement Association this year to establish five guidance centers in important areas, such as Huangxu in Zhenjiang, Taowu in Jiangning, Xinzhou in Yangzhou, and Jurong Yizheng. The total autumn planting production in the province is no less than one million and several hundred thousand sheets, which is enough for distribution. It is also heard that the Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, based on the submission of the Zhenjiang County Executive Committee, which was submitted by Sun Danzhen and Wang Jinshan, requesting to prepare a large amount of autumn seed and vigorously encourage breeding to alleviate the silkworm famine, sent a letter to the department for investigation. The department replied in the above situation and ordered the counties to follow the original plan. If the weather can clear up in the future, the results will be considerable.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Clarifies Graduation Qualifications of Advanced Academies</h3>
<p>▲Treatment Equivalent to Specialized Schools under the Old System or Vocational Schools under the Current System</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in response to an inquiry regarding the graduation qualifications of advanced academies, sent a letter to the Examination Yuan, stating: "Based on the petition from Yao Wenzhi, a graduate of the Zhejiang Advanced Academy, requesting that his graduation qualifications be verified according to previous cases and approved for participation in higher examinations, your committee inquired and requested a reply. In response, the entrance requirements for advanced academies during the late Qing Dynasty were limited to middle school graduates, and the duration of study was set at three years, the same as preparatory courses at universities and advanced agricultural and commercial academies. The treatment of their graduates, such as being granted the status of Juren and various official positions, was also the same. These types of advanced agricultural and commercial academies were equivalent to specialized schools under the old system and vocational schools under the current system. Therefore, the advanced regular courses can be treated similarly. Upon verification, the graduate qualifications of this student should receive the same treatment as specialized schools under the old system or vocational schools under the current system.

<h3>Songjiang's Primary and Secondary Education Circles Fight for Education Funds</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff in Songjiang County held its second general meeting in the meeting hall of the County Education Association yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. The chairman was Xu Renzun, and the recorder was Tang Zhenzhi. After the formalities, the chairman reported that the budget for various schools in the county for the 20th year had been arbitrarily reduced by the Department of Education, making it impossible to maintain operations. Taking tuition fees as an example, the original deduction for each class in urban primary schools was 48 yuan, but now the Department orders a deduction of 70 yuan per class, based on 35 students per class. The original deduction for each class in rural primary schools was 24 yuan, but now the Department orders a deduction of 56 yuan per class, based on 28 students per class. Primary school funding is already scarce, and now tuition fees are being deducted even further. The funding cuts for complete primary schools, middle schools, and normal schools are even greater. With such layers of exploitation, how can the primary and secondary school teachers and staff in the entire county bear this? The association has already sent telegrams to various agencies appealing for help. The original text of the telegram was read aloud. Next, the proposed motions were discussed: (1) What should be done if the funding for various schools in the 20th year is not fully resolved by the time school starts? It was resolved that, if necessary, the schools would jointly notify the students to postpone the start of school. (2) Set the date for the next meeting. It was decided that the next meeting would be held at 1:00 PM on August 5th at the County Education Association. It was also heard that if the authorities have not made any indication by the time of the next meeting, they plan to collectively petition the County Government.</p>
<h3>Opening of the YMCA Summer School</h3>
<p>The YMCA is holding a summer school for cadres in Lushan this year, as reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the summer school has opened in recent days. All teachers and students have arrived. The students attending the school represent YMCAs across the country, including Shenyang and Harbin in the Northeast, Xi'an and Taiyuan in the Northwest, Chongqing in Sichuan, and Fuzhou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou in the South, totaling more than 50 people. The courses include "Sociology," "Religious Philosophy," "YMCA Administration," "Personality Education Methods," "Vocational Guidance," and "Rural Affairs," totaling more than 20 courses. Experts have been specially invited to serve as professors. In addition to daily classes, there are also extracurricular activities such as lectures, discussions, trips, visits, swimming, and ball games to add to the fun. The summer school will last for one month and is scheduled to close on August 20th. The school is located in the Yun Valley of Lushan, which has elegant scenery and perfect facilities, making it an ideal place for cadres to study, research, and rest during the summer.</p>
<h3>Wuxian Education Bureau Plans to Issue Back Pay</h3>
<p>The Director of the Wuxian Education Bureau stated that the 19th year has long been concluded, and that half of the back pay for July has been collected and is scheduled to be issued by the end of the month. It is also heard that he is currently trying to raise temporary funds so that they can be issued as soon as possible to clear the procedures.</p>
<h3>New Normal School Established in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>▲Renamed Hangzhou Normal School</p>
<p>A new provincial normal school has been established in Zhejiang Province. Since the Department of Education commissioned Zhang Yuannian to prepare for it, all internal matters, such as the formulation of organizations, the recruitment of teachers and staff, and the preparation of enrollment matters, have been arranged. It is certain that classes will begin in September. It is heard that the school was originally named Zhejiang Provincial Normal School by the Department of Education, but the official seal issued by the Provincial Government yesterday was named Zhejiang Provincial Hangzhou Normal School. The school will definitely follow the official seal issued by the province and change its name. Also, the school originally chose the old government school as its location, but the houses there are dilapidated and leaking, making them unsuitable for use. It is necessary to rebuild them. The construction project is estimated to take about half a year. Therefore, it is heard that in September, a large building on Henghe Bridge will be rented for use as a temporary school building.</p>

<h3>Various Groups Prepare to See Off Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>▲August 16th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and the World Chinese Students' Association jointly initiated a meeting with universities and academic and cultural groups in the city to see off students studying abroad, as reported in this newspaper. After the notice was issued, the schools that have replied and agreed to participate include Jiaotong University, Jinan University, Zhongda Business School, Labor University, and Qixiu Girls' School. The groups include the Science Society of China, the China Vocational Education Society, the Tsinghua Alumni Association, and the China-America Progressive Association. The bookstores include the Commercial Press and the Zhonghua Book Company. The newspapers include the China Review Weekly and the Minguo Daily, totaling twenty groups. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, a preparatory meeting was held on the eighth floor of the Hua'an Building. Representatives from various schools and groups attended, including Zhang Mengjie from the Municipal Education Bureau, Xu Peikun from the Central Business School, Yang Yufen from Jinan University, Hu Xiongding from Jiaotong University, Yang Sifu from Labor University, Yang Yunzhong from the Science Society of China, Shi Boqun from the Tsinghua Alumni Association, Pan Guangjiong from the China-America Progressive Association, Zhao Ziyi from the Zhonghua Book Company, and Zhu Shaoping from the China Review Weekly Global Chinese Students' Association Qixiu Girls' School, totaling more than ten people.

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Reorganizes Municipal Rural Normal School</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, in view of the shortage of primary school arts and crafts teachers, reorganized the organizational structure of the Pudong Xinlu Municipal Rural Normal School to cultivate this type of teacher. Starting in the 20th year, two groups were established: arts and crafts and agricultural affairs. Both groups will enroll junior high school graduates. The original junior high school levels will stop enrolling new students and will be discontinued after graduation. This reorganization transforms the school into a normal school at the senior high school level and changes the school name to the Municipal Donglu Normal School. It is now heard that the school will be enrolling students soon. Registration will be open from July 30th to August 13th. The registration location is at the Municipal Education Bureau on Daji Road. The exam will be held on August 15th and 16th at the Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School on Huangjiaque Road.</p>
<h3>Development of the Zhongda Business School</h3>
<p>Since the Zhongda Business School in this port moved into its newly built buildings this spring, its scale has become larger and its facilities more complete. Currently, Mr. Xu Peikun is the president of the school. He has already decided on the direction of the school's recent development and has largely drafted the implementation plan, which will soon be available to the public. It is heard that Mr. Xu is extremely cautious in enriching and improving the curriculum and recruiting teachers. The professors who have been hired for the next semester are all scholars. Anyone with real talent and learning is recruited one by one. The number of applicants for new students this year is large, and the school's housing is insufficient, resulting in the temporary addition of a cool shed to accommodate more than a thousand people. The order during the examination was orderly. However, the examination curriculum for the new students in this class is different from previous years, attracting attention from all walks of life, and many people have asked questions. After President Xu's detailed explanation, he was finally understood. The special circumstances of this year's examination are briefly recorded below. In previous years, the Zhongda Business School's recruitment examinations always included economics and bookkeeping courses. However, all these courses were exempted from this year's examination. This is because students in different regions have different academic levels, and if these courses are tested, practical difficulties may arise. This is one of the reasons for the exemption. Secondly, when printing the enrollment brochure, the subject was not included. This is the second reason. However, at the same time, the examination for this year requires students to take biology, physics, and chemistry courses, which surprised all secondary school business students. This is because the existing secondary school business courses do not study these courses, so protests have been raised. After President Xu repeatedly reviewed the matter, he specially lowered the grading standards for this year's examination in order to avoid the regret of rejecting business students from afar. Seventy-one students have already been admitted. Today, advertisements have appeared in various newspapers, stating that these students must report to the Business School before September 1st. They must also take a group examination in English, Chinese, economics, and bookkeeping in order to be assigned to classes for lectures. In addition, President Xu pays special attention to the students' transfer process. If students request to transfer at any time and change their minds, they can show the weakness of the students' intentions. Therefore, he specifically stated to the new students in this class that they will not be transferred. If there are people who are interested in studying business, the Business School welcomes them very much. Those who have not yet made up their minds must think twice before acting.</p>
<h3>Publication of Recent Works by Western Painter Lu Erqiang</h3>
<p>Mr. Lu Erqiang, a professor of art at Xinhua and Guanghua Universities, has been studying art for more than ten years. He held a personal painting exhibition in Shanghai two years ago, and his excellent works have been respected by the art world. The World Book Company admired his name and asked him to compile a textbook on watercolor painting for middle schools. Mr. Lu spent two years writing the book, and it is heard that it was published a few days ago. The content of the book is extremely rich, covering figures, landscapes, birds and animals, still life, and other works. It also explains the principles of painting in detail, leaving nothing out. It is a work that will benefit later scholars. The difficulty that middle school librarians and teachers have in lacking good textbooks can be solved.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Practical Vocational Night School</h3>
<p>The clerical and Chinese typing courses at the Shanghai Practical Vocational Night School have recently graduated two sessions. Those who have been introduced to jobs include Gu Zengyi from the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Gan Weiling and Zhang Junbi from the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, Bi Yunxin from Jiaotong University, Miao Zhong from the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute, and Shao Yueqin from the Liu Naiyu Mansion. They have gained the trust of society. It is now known that the school board has publicly elected Mr. Gan Chunquan to be the principal, make substantive improvements, and has reported to the Municipal Education Bureau for record-keeping. Mr. Gan plans to open the following courses in August: (1) Banking and Accounting Course, currently being designed by Mr. Xu Xie Kang and Yan Zhen of the Shanghai Bank; (2) Municipal Engineering Course, which will teach urban water supply and sewage engineering, urban planning, road engineering, road planning, and reinforced concrete roof bridges and arch bridges, and is currently being designed by Mr. Xia Xingzhi of Central University; (3) Commercial Japanese Course, which is specifically designed for employees in the industrial and commercial sectors, focusing on commercial conversations, and is currently being designed by Mr. Jiang Junhui of the Modern Japanese Language Association. Experts and professors have been hired for all courses. It is also known that the Chinese typing course will continue to be offered, and Mr. Song Mingde and Jin Xiawen will continue to serve as the chief professors.

<h3>Farewell to the Basketball Aces of Shanghai College: The Yangshupu Team Embarks on a Tour to Hong Kong and Guangdong</h3>
<p>▲ The Entire Team of Twelve – Led by Wang Jinpeng</p>
<p>The Yangshupu basketball team, organized by students of Shanghai College's affiliated high school, boasts excellent players with superb skills. Under the scientific guidance of veteran basketball coach Wang Jinpeng in the past month, they have transformed into a formidable team. In their match against Shangda University, the Japanese were astonished and dismayed, as if they had descended from the heavens. Many fans came to send off the Yangshupu team. Old player Dai Linzhen was particularly reluctant to part, as he was a pillar of the team last year. Now, due to career constraints, he can only gaze at the distant clouds and await good news. With a loud whistle, the giant ship carried the athletes away. The tour is expected to last about three weeks, with destinations including Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shantou.</p>

<h3>Shop Space for Rent at the National Games</h3>
<p>▲ Ministry of Industry Requests Reduction... Advertising Must Also Be Considered</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th – The Ministry of Industry sent a letter to the Preparatory Committee of the National Games stating that the regulations for the commercial area at the Games tentatively stipulate 80 shop spaces, with rental fees of 60 yuan for Grade A spaces and 40 yuan for Grade B spaces. Considering that the Games only last for ten days, these fees are deemed too high. The Ministry requests a reduction. Regarding advertising, including foreign merchants should be carefully considered. The current period is one of vigorously promoting national goods and resisting foreign economic aggression. It is essential to instill awareness in the general youth and not compromise due to revenue concerns.</p>

<p>The Electric Farm</p>
<p>The world's most modern farm is located in East Grinstead, on the border of Surrey and Sussex in England. The farm covers an area of 600 acres and is jointly owned by three people. The person in charge is Mr. B. Matthews, who has devoted his life to researching how to use electricity to assist in farm work. Thanks to his talents, he has managed to use electricity for 67 different purposes on this unique farm. Electricity is used to generate light and heat in each beehive. As a result, the bees can start working earlier each year, and each hive can produce 17 pounds more honey than usual. When calculated, this is a considerable amount. Electricity is also used for horse care, which saves a lot of labor. He has created a special machine that takes care of brushing and feeding the horses. Electricity is also used in the chicken coop to create a special clock. In winter, it emits light that gradually brightens, creating an artificial sunrise that is one hour earlier than the real sunrise. This makes the chickens healthier and able to produce more eggs. In addition, electricity is fully utilized for plowing, hatching, milking, haymaking, pest control, and other tasks, with very satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>The Golden Bell Dog by the Sangzi River</h3>
<p>— Li Xufan</p>
<p>It is the nature of dogs to guard homes. In modern times, due to the evolution of trends, more families are raising dogs. Humans use their keen senses and, based on the differences in their breeds, divide them into hunting dogs, police dogs, and racing dogs for training. Dogs also rely on their strengths to assist humans in their work. However, there is also a type of dog that, without being raised by humans, can fulfill the responsibility of guarding the night: the Golden Bell Dog. My friend, Mr. Zhao Huisan, recently returned to the south after resigning from the Guisui Railway Bureau. There were no fewer than twenty people traveling with him. Passing through the Sangzi River area, the mountains are stacked upon each other, and animal tracks are everywhere. Those accustomed to this place all carry tents and other equipment to camp along the way. Mr. Zhao also did the same. On a certain night, as the fish began to jump in the early hours, he was leaning against the tent inside, about to fall asleep. Suddenly, he heard footsteps approaching and pacing outside the tent. Suspecting that wild beasts were invading, he quickly called his companions to be on guard. Among them, one familiar with the local situation said, "Why are you so alarmed? Don't worry. The sound you hear is not from wild beasts. It is the Golden Bell Dogs patrolling in formation to drive away wolves and protect us." Mr. Zhao was half-doubtful, so he peeked out through the tent opening. Indeed, he saw groups of three to five yellow dogs, as tall as children and larger than ordinary dogs. Their eyes were bright and piercing, and their appearance was quite intimidating. He offered them bread and steamed buns, and they readily accepted the food. They did not avoid strangers, as if they were dogs raised in a household. Mr. Zhao laughed and said, "These are truly temporary guards who don't receive salaries!" The Golden Bell Dog is not only seen in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It often inhabits the high mountains and forests of Suiyuan. Its four limbs are extremely sharp and it is good at jumping and skilled at overcoming wolves. When it sees a wolf, it will jump on its back. It immediately digs at the wolf's eyes with its sharp claws on its front feet, and it always hits its mark. It does not eat the defeated wolf. If it encounters a large number of wolves, the dog knows that it is outnumbered, so it barks loudly with a sound like a ringing bronze bell. Other dogs of its kind will gather in response to the sound and attack together across the mountains and fields, even reaching hundreds in number. They will not stop until the wolves flee in defeat or are wounded and killed. They have a strong spirit of loving the group and helping each other. Therefore, the Sangzi River area has a long route, inconvenient transportation, and steep mountains on both sides. Villages are extremely scarce, and wolves often appear there. Travelers often set up tents along the way to spend the night. Without the Golden Bell Dogs to guard the night, travelers would be hesitant and regard the area as a dangerous place. It can be seen that the Creator's creation of humans and things is truly unfathomable. This dog has the characteristic of resisting wolves and protecting humans, which is quite interesting to study. According to the locals, this dog is not raised by humans and likes to live in the wild. If people bring it back to raise it, it will become depressed and refuse to eat. Therefore, it cannot be kept as a domestic dog. Now, with Mr. Zhao's report, I will record it to share with readers.</p>
<h3>Miss Universe</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>This newspaper's pictorial weekly on the 26th of this month published the representative beauties selected from various countries around the world this year. Recently, in a re-election held in Cowenston, USA, Ms. Du Shudi of Belgium was selected as the most beautiful among the beauties for her healthy physique and was honored with the title of Miss Universe. The original picture is there for all to see and appreciate. Seeing is believing, and opinions vary depending on one's perspective. From my perspective, I dare say she is not beautiful. If you cover her hair and shoes and look at her whole body, she has a very robust and extraordinary posture, vaguely concealing a threatening and intimidating air. She resembles Xiang Yu, the Hegemon-King of Chu, but unbelievably, she is Yu Ji. I like to nitpick words. In general, praising the femininity of a beauty always involves characters with the "woman" radical from the Kangxi dictionary, such as graceful, charming, enchanting, and beautiful. If you want to praise her health, like a female knight or female general, it is necessary to combine terms of strength and grace. Chinese and Western concepts are different. Now, the most beautiful among the beautiful is selected after repeated elections, and the judgment is based on the four words "healthy physique." It is like a comment from a physical education expert, boxer, or soldier, which seems ill-fitting for a young lady. It is like calling a man "slender," which a man would not appreciate. By analogy, a lady may not appreciate it either. I also like to worry on behalf of others. The universe encompasses the four directions and what is above and below. The cosmos encompasses the past and the present. With such a number one beauty, she may not adhere to the principle of remaining single. I ask, where can we find a Universe Young Master to pair her with? Alas, I have thought of one person. The warlord Hou Jing raised troops and called himself the "Universe General." When Emperor Wu of Liang saw the proclamation, he was shocked and said, "Does the General have the title of Universe?" If Ms. Du is willing to marry General Hou and act as his matchmaker, I would be pleased.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Cuckoo)</p>
<p>Shi Yousan probably has rebellious bones. He is best at rebelling. He rebelled against Feng once, Jiang twice, and Yan three times. In three years, he rebelled three times in a row. The "You" character can be cut off at the head and changed to "Shi Fan San" (Shi Rebellious Three). Unexpectedly, he has recently been preparing troops and horses to rebel against Zhang. In that case, "Shi Yousan" should be changed to "Shi Fan Si" (Shi Rebellious Four). I only hope he stops here and does not continue to "rebel five" or "rebel six."</p>
<h3>A Famous Dan and a Famous Play: Yutang Chun</h3>
<p>— Gauze</p>
<p>From the late Qing Dynasty to the present, the past thirty years have witnessed an extraordinary development in opera, gradually becoming the national opera of the Republic of China. During this period, many famous actors have emerged, too numerous to mention. Since Mei Lanfang gained fame, the trend has changed again. What was once centered on male roles has transformed into being centered on female roles. The title of "King of the Opera World" belongs not to male leads but to female leads. Famous female leads have emerged one after another, resulting in the so-called "Four Great Golden Kang" Mei (Lanfang), Cheng (Yanqiu), Shang (Xiaoyun), and Xun (Huisheng). Male leads have become increasingly weak, mostly becoming appendages of famous female leads. Moreover, there are more than just these famous female leads. In addition to the Four Great Golden Kang, there are also Xu Biyun and female actor Xue Yanqin, who can each lead their own forces. There are also the Southern Four Golden Kang: Xiao Yang Yuelou, Liu Xiaoheng, Wang Yunfang, and Zhao Junyu, who also possess considerable accomplishments. Their influence is truly great. With so many famous female leads, naturally, female-led operas are more fashionable than male-led operas. In addition to the new operas arranged by each famous female lead, many old operas are also very popular. The most fashionable of the old operas is Yutang Chun. Each famous female lead attaches great importance to this opera. Every time they come south to Shanghai, they perform it several times, and each performance always sells out. It can be seen how enthusiastic the public is. Xun Huisheng is especially popular for this opera. Xu Biyun also staged a prequel, Yutang Chun, using the three words "Yutang Chun" as a gimmick. Not long ago, Mei Lanfang performed for three nights at the Grand Theatre to raise funds for the Jiangxi flood disaster, and one of the nights was Yutang Chun. Given this situation, it is not an exaggeration to say that Yutang Chun is the first famous opera. Now, let's talk about the opera Yutang Chun itself. The plot of this opera is based on true events. It was originally Qinqiang opera, but it was changed to Peking opera at the end of the Qing Dynasty, hence the name "New Yutang Chun." However, most of the lyrics are still from the original version. Therefore, there are many places where the rhyme scheme does not match. I remember that this publication once carried a manuscript discussing this between Tianxu Wosheng and a certain gentleman, but I can't remember the details completely. Everyone probably knows the places where the rhyme scheme does not match, so there is no need to list them. I will only talk about the reason why the rhyme scheme does not match in this opera. Originally, Jin people spoke with a nasal tone, and the "Dong" and "Zhen" rhymes were easily confused. For example, "Hunyuan Prefecture" was pronounced "Hongyuan Prefecture" by Jin people. There was little difference between "Hong" and "Hun." Once it was changed to Peking opera, using the Central Plains rhyme, the rhyme scheme no longer matched. At the time, when it was first changed to Peking opera, why didn't anyone notice this and just swallowed it whole, resulting in a flaw in the famous opera? It is truly regrettable. The two characters "Hongdong" are even more confusing. I don't know that this opera is based on true events. It is neither Hongtong nor Hongtong. The correct name is Hongdong, which is an oblique tone, not a level tone. During the Zhou Dynasty, Hongdong was the state of the Marquis of Yang. During the Northern Qi Dynasty, it was Hongdong Town. During the Sui Dynasty, it was Hongdong County, and it has continued to be so to this day. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, it belonged to Pingyang Prefecture in Shanxi. In the early years of the Republic of China, when administrative regions were reorganized, it belonged to the Hedong Street in Shanxi. The files of the Yutang Chun case are still preserved in the Hongdong County Government. You can see them for a dollar. So, why are people today confused about the current county name? It is indeed a strange thing. Furthermore, the reason why this opera can become a famous opera is because famous female leads have popularized it. However, in my opinion, just performing the three trials is only one scene from beginning to end, which is extremely simple. However, it takes no less than forty-five minutes to an hour to sing. It is very tiring for the performer, and the audience also finds it unbearable. It can be considered an extremely difficult opera to please the audience. Yet, it has become so popular, which is puzzling.</p>
<p>▲ News from the Art World: Novelist Zhang Zhenyuan is also skilled in cursive script. He previously collaborated with Ma Henian on a calligraphy and painting fan exhibition, which sold out instantly. Later visitors had nothing to buy, so starting yesterday, another exhibition was opened at the Liangchen Haoyou Society on Beijing Road for ten days. The items displayed this time are all gold-faced, with Zhang Zhenyuan's double-lined cursive script, self-recorded from his original novels. The details of the green landscape paintings that Mr. Ma collaborated on are even more elaborate. Each item is sold cheaply for five yuan. (Birun)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on American Women's Lives (4)</h3>
<p>— Sent</p>
<p>▲ Career: American women's education has equal opportunities with men. In their careers, women also tend to progress together with men. After leaving school, those who are poor are indeed eager to find a career to maintain their livelihood. Even those who are wealthy do not want to enjoy life at home but are willing to serve in society. They believe that a woman who has received an education and does not serve the public has lost the purpose of education. Failing to find a career exposes women's weaknesses and is a sign of women's incompetence, which is also very shameful. There are also many women whose husbands hold superior positions and have abundant income, but they still want to find work. They are hardworking and can endure hardship. Even if they work outside during the day, they still handle household affairs as usual, as few small families hire servants. The most common career for women is as shop clerks. In large and small businesses in various cities, their presence can be seen everywhere. According to my (Dr. Qian's self-proclaimed) observation, their service performance is better than men, such as: (1) agile movements (2) clear minds (3) polite to people. Second, typists, secretaries in government offices, nurses in hospitals, kindergarten nannies, primary and secondary school teachers... etc., are the biggest outlets for women. In addition, those who graduate from university graduate schools and engage in independent professions include doctors, lawyers, accountants, and university professors. Almost all men's careers have been partially occupied by women.</p>
<p>▲ Political Participation: Women's nature is gentle, and their魄力 and decisiveness are naturally not comparable to men. Therefore, the number of women active on the political stage in various countries is still small. The history of women's political participation in the United States is relatively long. As far as I know, the highest political position for women in the United States is that two of the forty-eight state governors are women. There are also many women in the state government's secretary-general and senior political officials. There are also several mayors who are women. There are even more female judges. Among the female judges of the Supreme Court in Ohio (Ohio), women also occupy a seat. It can be seen that women's political participation in the United States is more developed than in other countries. Also, during parliamentary elections, they compete fiercely. However, it is not for their own sake but for the number of seats for women or for the number of votes for female candidates. Based on the current situation, it is reasonable to be infinitely optimistic about their future in political participation. (The End)</p>

<h3>Woman, Woman (4)</h3>
<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>Mr. Lu walked out of the Ding's residence, his joyful expression replaced by a hurried look. Thinking about the conversation he had just had with Miss Ding, he felt it was indeed his best work; but how would he deal with tomorrow's appointment? Counting the money in his pocket, he had only two dollars left. Needless to say, buying a valuable gift was not permitted by reality. Even buying a decent bouquet of flowers would make him hesitate.</p>
<p>He returned to the school, where the dormitory during the holidays was truly desolate. He alone assessed his future fate, as if boundless light were surrounded by heavy clouds. The more he thought, the more distant and empty he felt. Finally, he spent an unavoidable night in a hot dream of vagueness and emptiness.</p>
<p>When he woke up, it was not yet dawn. But he had finally decided on his final plan. He couldn't sleep anymore. Calculating that there was still time to catch the early train, he hurriedly put on his clothes, didn't wash his face, didn't fold his quilt, didn't take anything, and hurried to the train station.</p>
<p>Bags, baskets, boxes, and people filled the carriages of the third-class train. He was just a lone individual. He accidentally heard the hawkers selling their wares on the platform, and finally remembered that his mother had told him to buy some bananas when he went back. He painfully spent the remaining forty cents to buy a bunch of bananas as the only gift he would bring home.</p>
<p>Suzhou had arrived. Looking out of the train window at the towering North Temple Pagoda, it still proudly looked down on this unimproved ancient city. Only the complex sounds of people and horses outside the station clearly indicated their urgent expectations. Mr. Lu was reluctant to hear the shouting of many coachmen soliciting customers, because it seemed that he would always feel an unusual sense of shame and resentment in his own mind.</p>
<p>His home was not far from the station. He carried the only bunch of bananas and walked slowly. But many coachmen were disappointed, because in their initial psychology, a foreign-dressed guest from Shanghai like this could at least earn more fare money.</p>
<p>The scenery remained the same. A burst of dog barking chased Mr. Lu to his own home. When he saw his own gate, he only felt annoyance. He only silently prayed that this time when he had to return, he would not have to return unavoidably again!</p>
<p>"Xiao Rong! Is that you? Wearing foreign clothes, you look like a different person!" When Mr. Lu stepped into the gate, the young clerk standing by the door was stunned. His seemingly surprised tone made Mr. Lu have to lower his head and gently ask, "Is Dad at home?"</p>
<p>"What a coincidence! Today our carriage didn't go to catch the early train business. He's probably inside. Speaking of which, they've been looking forward to you for a long time. How come you only thought of coming home today?" the young clerk said happily.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market Without Major Fluctuations</h3>
<p>▲The Entire City's Four Tael Difference: Yesterday, the 29th, the gold price fluctuation was minimal, with only a four-tael difference around 745 taels. As a result, it only fell by two mace. Trading within the market was not very active, but sentiment was calm. The market opened lower in the morning, but was not affected by the decline in the silver market. It seemed that the European market was regaining strength, and there was a tendency to maintain stability. Both official and unofficial exchange rates were stable, and subsequent fluctuations were only two or three taels. The after-market was particularly sluggish, and since it was Wednesday, there was usually no market for drafts. The final calculation was above 44 taels. Currently, the total amount of transactions in the exchange is about 34,500. It can be seen that trading has not been strong recently. It is expected that there will be no major changes in large transactions this morning. (According to London telegraph, there were no changes.)</p>
<p>▲Slightly Lower Opening in the Morning: The opening price for September was slightly down by five mace, at 744 taels and five mace. Large transactions were indeed reduced by a quarter, and the silver price only fell by an eighth. The same was true for private telegrams, indicating a downward trend in sentiment. Subsequently, it increased to 5 taels and two mace due to purchases by Dada Cheng, Cui Changyong, and others. Then, the Dalian gang, along with Taichang and retail investors, sold, causing it to drop by 2 taels to 43 taels. Shortly after, Hengyu, Richang, Yuan Maoyong, and others bought, while the exchange market remained flat, with few transactions. Only Shanghai and Meifeng traded Citibank August at 30 yuan and 0.05625. When the shilling quotation was announced, it was 45 taels and one mace. Without further changes, it was suppressed to 44 taels. Afterward, banks traded British gold for August at 0.0625, and banks ate 0.125 for September. On the trading floor, the Dalian gang, Yuancheng, Sen Changyong, and others entered the market, causing a jump of 3 taels, reaching 47 taels at 10 o'clock. Later, spot US dollars were traded by Hua Bank at 30 yuan and a half, and sold by retail investors. It has now depreciated by 2 taels, reaching 44 taels and eight mace at 10:45.

Afterwards, it was extremely stable, only slightly down by 1 tael, due to sales by Qian Changxiang and others. At 11:45, there were slight purchases, causing it to rise to 45 taels and eight mace. The market closed at noon at 5 taels and four mace. Although the Indian exchange was slightly lower by one anna, it was not affected. The quotation remained at 791 taels and four mace, calculated at 46-47 taels.</p>
<p>▲The After-Market is Increasingly Mediocre: The after-market opened at 45 taels, then 4 taels and four mace, due to the Indian exchange reporting a large anna. Then it was 4 taels and nine mace, followed by sales from the Dalian gang and Shen Kang, causing it to fall by 1 tael and three mace, reaching 43 taels and five mace at 2:45. Afterwards, it rose by 1 tael, and after 3:15, it was slightly suppressed by a small amount. The closing price was once quoted at 44 taels and two mace, but various firms were still reluctant to let go and did not disperse. At 3:30, it was 43 taels and nine mace. After 4 o'clock, it rebounded by seven or eight mace, reaching 4 taels and seven mace, due to slight purchases by Cui Changyong. However, it could not hold steady and immediately fell to 4 taels and two or three mace. It continued until the market closed at 4:30, with the result being 44 taels and eight mace, only down two mace compared to the previous day. According to the highest price of the day at 47 taels and the lowest price at 43 taels, there was a fluctuation of 4 taels.</p>
<p>▲Guest Firms Procuring Spot Red: The opening price for goods was 4 taels and three mace, noon closing was 5 taels and a half, and the afternoon price was 5 taels and a half, with the closing price at 3 taels and a half. The quotation was calculated at 46-47 taels. The settlement for this month has been cleared. August is 43 taels, September is 45 taels, and the additional water is 43 taels, the same in the afternoon. The spot red bars have also slightly increased, calculated at 10 taels, seven mace, and five cash to 11 taels. Ying Fengheng sold over 1,000 taels to the Tianjin Dalian gang, and Dada Cheng and Taikang Run sold over 5,000 taels to Ying Fengheng. The trading seemed to be active because guest firms have started procuring. However, there is sufficient inventory in the market, about 30,000 taels. The public bills will be settled on August 1st, and spot firms are actively accepting them, but the price cannot rise significantly.</p>
<p>▲Market Trading is Not Active: According to statistics, Zhifengyong, Dada Ying, Yuan Maoyong, Qian Changxiang, Yu Da, Fu Taiheng, and Hua Changyong all purchased on the trading floor. Wanxing and Tong Dachang also purchased more than they sold. Shunli Hongli and retail investors sold. Yuantai, Yuancheng, Yuan Dayong, Fuyu, and Sen Changyong had varying purchases and sales. In the afternoon, due to Wednesday, trading was even scarcer. Only Cui Changyong and Dada Cheng made slight purchases. Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Dayong, Yuantai, Fu Taiheng, Yifengyong, Wanxing, etc., had slight purchases and sales. Zhifengyong and Shen Kang sold slightly. The Guangdong gang remained inactive. The Dalian gang sold a total of 800-900 taels and purchased over 1,000 taels.</p>

<h3>It is Difficult for the Loan Market to Have Major Changes</h3>

The early market was 7 qian 2 fen 5 li 3 hao 7 hu and a half, and the noon market was 7 qian 2 fen 5 li 2 hao and a half, only slightly lower by 1 hao and 2 hu and a half compared to the previous day's noon market.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Coarse Yarn Sales are Gradually Becoming Active</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose at noon. However, the overseas cotton yarn situation continued to trend downwards, and some manufacturers continued to sell off, making the market even weaker. However, the coarse yarn business in the market gradually became active, and sentiment was relatively calm. In the afternoon, rumors in the market that the factory law would be implemented caused factories to reduce production and increase wages, leading to higher costs. As a result, sentiment was greatly shaken. Rongxinghao continued to purchase and increase its stake. The number of yarn packages in the registry continued to accumulate, reaching over 400,000 packages. The long and short sides are evenly matched, and the future situation is likely to change.</p>
<p>▲Man-made Standard Rapidly Rebounded in the Afternoon: The opening of the man-made standard market in the exchange was affected by the poor performance of foreign cotton, causing the market to trend downwards and sentiment to be very weak. Prices fell by 7-9 qian to 1 tael. In the afternoon, rumors of the factory law caused the market to rise rapidly by 8-9 qian to 1 tael and 1 qian. The total transaction volume was 32,400 packages. The sales included Meiji's purchase of 1,100 packages, Changfeng's purchase of 1,150 packages, Gongtai's purchase of 1,100 packages, Daji's purchase of 1,050 packages, Rongxing's purchase of 2,000 packages, Dafeng's purchase of 700 packages, and Dachang's purchase of 850 packages.

<h3>Cotton Market Situation Slightly Stable</h3>
<p>The American cotton market remained sluggish, with no signs of recovery. The weather in this port was clear, and there was hope that the water levels in various areas would recede. Therefore, the selling pressure remained high, and there was still no development in actual demand. As a result, sentiment was flat. However, there was news of heavy rain in Hankou, and the prospects for new cotton development were uncertain. Changes in the weather were also difficult to predict. Cautious individuals became observers, and their attitude was weak.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Standard Fell More Than it Rose: The opening of the Hankou standard market in the exchange was affected by the poor performance of foreign cotton, causing prices to fall by 2-3 qian.

The cost of production is estimated to be 14 cents per pound, but if there is no major improvement in the current market situation, the new cotton will only be sold for 9 cents per pound after it enters the market.</p>
<h3>Grain: Sunny Weather Causes Rice Market to Plummet by One Yuan</h3>
<p>▲Xinzha: Yesterday, the supply from the west road was still surging, and transactions for various goods were extremely sluggish. Due to the sunny weather, there were few buyers from various shops, and sentiment was weak. Hou Geng and Zaowan Dao (early and late rice) fell by 4-5 jiao. There was little interest in Lu Yang Jian and Bian Yin Yuan, so prices dropped by 3 jiao. However, the Bu Jian goods were scarce, and prices remained at the original level. According to a survey at 4-5 o'clock yesterday along the Suzhou River, there were a total of over 260 boats, with an average of 90 shi per boat, totaling approximately 23,400 dan of Bai Geng and Xian rice.</p>
<p>▲Nanshi: There were about 20 source firms from various gangs. Due to the sunny weather, city and rural shops reduced their purchasing interest, and commission purchases were also thin. There were very few buyers in the market, and sentiment was downwards. The Hou Geng market price plummeted by one yuan compared to yesterday. There was still a large accumulation of early and thin rice, and there were no transactions with guest firms. The local sales were limited, and prices also fell by 6-7 jiao. There was a lack of appetite for Yang Lu Jian goods, and the situation remained stable. Bian Hua sales were average, and there was no rise or fall. Few guest Jian rice arrived, so the trend continued to weaken.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Opens High and Stays High</h3>
<p>▲Gangs from the Yangtze River and Inland Areas Competing to Purchase</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially fluctuated. Due to the continuing good weather, foreign wheat also fluctuated by one or two jiao. The market sentiment was very flat. However, after the second session, it became increasingly popular because gangs from the inland and Yangtze River areas felt that the heavy floods would be difficult to control for a while, the price of grain would skyrocket, and famine was inevitable. Therefore, buyers remained eager, competing to purchase both near and far terms. As a result, sentiment was excited, and prices opened high and stayed high. The near-term market was particularly popular due to factory restrictions. For the far-term market, Fufeng sold about 200,000, slightly easing the situation. As a result, this month rose by 2.5 fen compared to the previous day, August rose by 2.75 li, September rose by 2.5 fen, October rose by 1.75 li, November rose by 2 fen, and December rose by 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Manipulation and Speculation in the Wheat Market</h3>
<p>▲Near-Term Rose by One Qian... Far-Term Slightly Declined</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a sudden and significant change in the wheat market. The opening in the morning was relatively stable. Later, the inland gangs, aware of the disastrous floods and interrupted transportation, realized that the supply of wheat would definitely be affected. Therefore, while foreign wheat could still be delivered in the far term, only local wheat could be used in the near term. As a result, they absorbed as much as possible to prepare for manipulation and speculation. The famine has not yet occurred, but speculators immediately raised prices. The instability of domestic grain prices is a major concern for people's food supply. The opening price in the afternoon had already risen covertly, and later it rose even more sharply, with a difference of 3 fen compared to the previous day's closing price. The far-term market, due to concerns about foreign wheat, saw a slight drop in price increases. As a result, August rose by 1 qian, September rose by 7 fen, October rose by 6 fen, November rose by 4 fen, and December rose by 3 fen. Due to the scarcity of spot wheat and the interruption of the supply source, asking prices also rose by 3-4 fen. Over 2,000 packages of wheat from Kunshan, Anting, Chongming, Zhenjiang, Chuzhou, Penglai, and Waigang were purchased by Fuxin and Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Tunxi Zhenmei Active Sales to France</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, British firm Xiehe Yanghang expressed a strong interest in Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian Zhenmei green teas due to receiving overseas demand. Jinlong and Tongfu and other firms also actively searched for supplies. The total transaction volume in the city reached over 2,500 boxes, making it the most active trading in recent times. However, there were still no large-scale sales of Wuyuan Gaozhuang Zhenmei. The market for Zhunmei and Xiumei goods became increasingly firm. Shrimp Eye Pearl Tea also saw slightly more sales than before. The overall trend of the tea market showed signs of firm stability.</p>
<h3>New Silkworm Cocoon Waste from Hangzhou and Shaoxing Continues to be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>This year, both the spring and summer silkworm crops in Hangzhou and Shaoxing experienced poor harvests. The production of silkworm cocoon waste also decreased, while demand in Shanghai was high. Yesterday, 240 dan of new silkworm cocoon waste from Hangzhou and Shaoxing were shipped to Shanghai. The market remained popular.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firm Silk Has a Quote But No Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various types of foreign firm silk in Shanghai had a quote but no market. The silk sales in New York, Lyon, etc., were stagnant, and there were no reports of progress from Shanghai. European firms were eager to suppress prices and hoard supplies, while Chinese silk merchants refused to sell at a loss. The market was quiet, and no transactions were reported.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods: New Fuzhou Yuanhong Lychees Have Arrived</h3>
<p>▲Selling Price Approximately 100 Taels</p>
<p>Yuanhong lychees produced in Fuzhou, with small seeds, thick flesh, and exceptional sweetness, have always been known as a famous product. This year's output was very low, and land prices were high. Fresh fruits had already entered the market early. However, since dried fruits need to be sun-dried and fire-roasted, the first batch of goods only arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling over 200 boxes. Half of them were being transshipped to other ports, and half were self-operated by merchants. It is reported that the cost is approximately 130 yuan, and the estimated selling price should be around 100 taels, but the market has not yet been fully established.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Selling Off Lotus Green is in Full Swing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market report from the producing areas: Cuban spot sugar showed no increase or decrease, and New York futures for all months fell by one cent compared to the previous report. Java spot sugar also remained unchanged. The trade association's trading was sluggish, with weak buying interest, and the market was unusually depressed. Dutch 24-grade coarse white sugar was quoted at 11 taels and 5 qian, and Hong Kong goods were quoted at 11 taels and 4 qian, but there were still few inquiries. 20-grade medium white sugar was quoted at 10 taels and 9 qian, with slight transactions. Lotus green was quoted at 8 taels and 6 qian to 6 qian and a half, and the trend was favorable. Taikoo chariot sugar, DY mark, was quoted at 11 taels and 8 qian, and B mark was quoted at 12 taels, but there were also few buyers. There was selling off of Dutch sugar, with Huaxin and Bingchang No. 2 offering lotus green, priced at 4.3 Dutch guilders. Nanshenglong offered September goods, priced at 4.175 guilders. Traders' purchasing interest was very weak, and although there were slight transactions, the market showed signs of weakness.</p>
<h3>Metals: British Galvanized Iron Price Drops by Half a Pound</h3>
<p>▲Overall City View: Yesterday's metals market was superficially lively, with a large number of goods being exported, but they were all previously approved orders. Discussions in yesterday's market, aside from a few essential items, saw little trading in mainstream goods. However, due to the Yangtze River route being unable to ship Japanese goods, the market has switched to British and American goods. Therefore, flat galvanized iron, corrugated iron, new lead wire, French nails, etc., which are similar to Japanese goods, have recently shown a favorable trend.</p>
<p>▲Very Strong Orders for British Galvanized Iron: Yesterday, over 400-500 tons of British galvanized iron were ordered. The price was half a pound lower than the previous day, calculated at 15 pounds per ton. These are forward contracts for shipments in August and September.</p>
<p>▲Dalian Gang Stirring After a Long Period of Quiet: Yesterday, the Dalian gang showed signs of activity in the metals market after a long period of quiet. However, peers felt that the gang's asking prices were very low, hoping that the gang had good sales channels.</p>
<p>▲Gangs from the Yangtze River Inland Waterways Actively Purchase American Galvanized Iron: Yesterday, 600-700 dan of 48-sheet American galvanized iron were sold to gangs from the Yangtze River inland waterways, marking the busiest period in half a year. The market prices were 19 taels and 2.5 qian for 48-sheet, 19 taels and 5 qian for 38-sheet, 18 taels and 5 qian for 32-sheet, 17 taels and 5 qian for 25-sheet, and 17 taels and 2.5 qian for 21-sheet.</p>

<h3>French Concession Public Court Officially Taken Over on the 1st</h3>
<p>▲Liang Renjie, President of the Third High Court Branch</p>
<p>▲Ying Shi, President of the Second Special District Court</p>
<p>▲Improving the Management Methods of Prisons</p>
<p>The case of recovering the Shanghai French Concession Public Court has been completed through negotiations between representatives of the Chinese and French governments. The agreement on the recovery of the Public Court was formally signed on the 28th of this month by representatives of both sides at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing. The full text of the agreement consists of 14 articles and one exchange of letters. The content and methods are roughly the same as the agreement for the Public Concession. At the same time, the Ministry of Justice issued instructions, and Xu Weizhen, President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, specially ordered Yang Zhaojun, President of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, to prepare to be responsible for the takeover. On the French side, the Consul in Shanghai also ordered the Public Court to prepare to officially hand over on August 1st. The organization and personnel after the Public Court is taken back, as well as the takeover procedures and subsequent reforms, are separately recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Organization after Recovery: The Ministry of Justice has decided on the organization after the recovery of the French Public Court, reorganizing the original Public Court into the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, and establishing the Jiangsu Third Higher Branch Court as an appellate body to fully comply with the Chinese judicial system. Because the Public Court only has two tribunals, which is insufficient to handle cases, it has been decided to add two more tribunals. However, there will be no distinction between civil, criminal, and enforcement designations. In addition, because the original buildings are insufficient for office space, seven buildings have been rented opposite the Public Court in He Mei Fang to serve as the Second Special District Local Court. Six buildings have also been rented in Heng Ai Li on Avenue de President Conty to serve as the office of the Third Higher Branch Court.</p>
<p>▲Selection of Personnel for the Two Courts: The Ministry of Justice has selected several judges with excellent character and learning from the courts of various provinces to serve as presidents and presiding judges of the reorganized courts. According to this newspaper's reporter, it has been internally determined that the position of President of the Third Higher Branch Court will be filled by Liang Renjie, President of the Jiangxi Higher Court, and the position of President of the Second Special District Local Court will be filled by Ying Shi, Presiding Judge of the Civil Tribunal of the First Special District Court of the Public Concession. It is reported that the position of Chief Prosecutor of the Third Higher Branch Court will be filled by Qian Qian, Chief Prosecutor of the Hubei Higher Court. The selection of personnel for the positions of presiding judge of the two courts is still underway, but it is said that Zhou Han, Presiding Judge of the First Special District Local Court, may be transferred. As for the number of judges, it has been internally determined to be six to eight, and the selection of personnel is also underway. However, according to reliable sources, Zhou Renda of the First Special District Court has been decided to be transferred to serve as a judge of the Second Court. The above personnel selections will be officially announced as soon as the takeover is completed.</p>
<p>▲Prisons Must Be Reformed: According to news from the Shanghai judicial authorities, the content of the agreement to recover the French Public Court is the same as that of the Public Concession, but the French side has completely returned the right to manage prisons to China, unlike the agreement for the Public Concession, where the right to manage prisons remains in the hands of foreigners. The Shanghai judicial authorities believe that the original management methods of the French Public Court prison have many shortcomings, such as: (1) small space and overcrowding, which does not conform to hygiene; (the original prison initially had one person per room, which was later increased to three people per room); (2) overly strict management, which violates humanitarianism; (3) religious methods are used to teach and guide prisoners, with only a few priests providing instruction, which seems unlikely to be effective; (4) work and rest are not adjusted, and the ability of prisoners is not considered, forcing them to engage in hard labor, such as forcing intellectuals to do hard labor, which seems inappropriate, and the rewards given are also very few. After the recovery, the above points must be reformed, and modifications will also be made to the prison buildings. More than one hundred experienced and capable managers from prisons in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces will be sent to Shanghai to fill these positions. This group of personnel will arrive in Shanghai in the coming days, and more than ninety pairs of leather shoes and one hundred and ninety sets of uniforms have been made for use.</p>
<p>▲Insufficient Funding: After the recovery and reorganization of the French Public Court, the recurring expenses should also be increased because it is larger than before. The court itself only has an annual income of approximately 200,000 yuan. After the reorganization, the expenses of the two courts will be at least 30,000 yuan per month (the two courts require several tens of thousands of yuan per month, and the prison requires 7,000 yuan per month). Based on an annual calculation, at least 400,000 yuan is needed, which is twice the court’s own income. It is reported that after the establishment, the Ministry of Justice will allocate subsidies to cover this shortfall.</p>
<p>▲Takeover Set for the 1st: President Yang of the First Special District Court informally met with French Consul Ganglin the day before yesterday. Ganglin stated that he had ordered the French Public Court to hand over everything on Saturday (August 1st) and that all expenses for the prison would cease from August 1st. Yang traveled to Beijing that evening and returned to Shanghai on the 30th. President Yang is preparing to officially take over on August 1st and has scheduled a meeting with Ganglin today to discuss the takeover procedures. President Yang stated that he will actively prepare after the takeover and expects to officially establish the court on August 16th. If preparations are not completed in time, the establishment must be announced by September 1st at the latest.</p>
<p>▲French Consul Travels to Beijing: The French Consul-General, Ganglin, and the negotiation committee member were playing in Putuo, and because the continuous rains were too heavy, the Consul was unable to arrive in Beijing as scheduled when the Public Court agreement was signed the day before yesterday. He only returned to Shanghai from Putuo the night before last. Because the agreement had to be published immediately after signing, Ganglin arrived in Shanghai the night before last and took a China National Aviation Corporation plane to Beijing at 7 AM yesterday, arriving in Nanjing at 9:15 AM yesterday. He went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to complete the signing (New Sound News Agency).</p>
<p>▲Full Text Announced: After the French Consul went to Beijing to complete the signing yesterday morning, both sides announced the full text of the agreement that afternoon. The agreement stipulates that the effective period is three years, from August 1, 1931 (the 20th year of the Republic of China), to July 31, 1934 (the 23rd year of the Republic of China). All Shanghai French Public Courts and the regulations and ordinances related to the Public Courts will be abolished when the agreement takes effect (i.e., August 1st) (New Sound News Agency).</p>
<h3>Minister Song Denies the Rights to Guangdong Bonds</h3>
<p>▲Notice to Chinese and Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen of the National Government issued a notice yesterday: "Regarding the notice, the domestic and foreign debts and reparations borne by customs duties, and the funds allocated for unsecured domestic and foreign debts, are secured by the entire national customs duties, and are not mortgaged by any specific part. All national customs duties, regardless of which part, are obligated to compensate for domestic and foreign debts and reparations. At present, the so-called old portion of customs duties collected by national customs is only sufficient to pay off foreign debts and reparations. Now, the Guangdong rebels have withheld all the new portion of customs duties collected by the customs offices in Guangdong and Guangxi, using it for their own purposes, and plan to issue prize bonds secured by the duties. These acts not only hinder the integrity of the customs but also deprive the vested rights of the bondholders secured by the customs duties. Therefore, this notice is to inform all Chinese and foreign banks, merchants, and people that all prize bonds or other bonds issued by the Guangdong rebels, whether secured by all or part of the customs duties, are invalid. The National Government will under no circumstances recognize that such bonds have any right to claim repayment of principal or interest from the central treasury's past, present, or future income. This notice is hereby issued."</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance of the National Government.</p>

<p>▲Commercial Association's Notice: To whom it may concern, this time economic severance with Japan should be automatically organized by the business community. As this city is the focus of national attention, it should be the first to advocate and comply with the principle of automatic organization, etc. Our factory is one of the city's domestic goods factories and should join the movement. Therefore, over the years, we have spared no expense to painstakingly research and use the latest electric machines to meticulously weave 320-needle to 360-needle domestic Guo Fu brand silk dancing socks and various kinds of men's and women's silk and thread socks. We have long enjoyed the support of merchants both in and outside of this city, who have actively purchased and promoted our products. We are also grateful for the praise and advocacy of all sectors, which has encouraged us to work harder and strive for perfection to repay the concern of all sectors for domestic products. Now, for the sake of aiding overseas Chinese and resisting Japan, we hope that all sectors will exert their utmost sincerity to strive for the final survival of the nation. All employees and workers of our factory unanimously refuse to purchase Japanese goods. To facilitate the purchase of domestic goods, we have specially established a distribution office and retail store at 195 Guangxi Road, offering various products at greatly reduced prices regardless of cost. A wide variety of colors and styles are on display. Patriotic comrades are welcome to visit and inspect, and we will serve you sincerely.</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Committee, regarding the disposal of Japanese goods, during its third Executive Committee meeting, based on a proposal by Design Committee member Chen Songyuan, appointed Tao Baichuan, Zhu Yingpeng, Li Wenjie, Yu Hualong, Fang Jiaobo, and other five committee members to jointly review the matter. Yesterday, the Review Committee finalized its review report and submitted it to the fourth Executive Committee meeting for approval. From now on, all Japanese goods will be handled accordingly. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Disposal Measures: The fourth Executive Committee meeting was held at 5:00 PM yesterday. Over twenty Executive Committee members attended. Wang Xiaolai was publicly elected as chairman to discuss the review report on the disposal of Japanese goods submitted by the Review Committee. The following resolutions were passed: (A) The disposal of Japanese goods should be divided into three steps: (1) For Japanese goods paid for by merchants and stored before July 14th, they should be registered with the committee within the registration period. Upon completion of registration, certificates will be issued allowing their sale without charge. However, if Japanese goods paid for by merchants and stored before July 14th are transported and sold without registration, and are discovered by this committee, an anti-Japanese aid-to-overseas-Chinese relief fund of 10% of the value will be collected, and registration will be supplemented. (2) For Japanese goods paid for by merchants and stored between July 14th and July 24th, they should be registered with the committee within the registration period. At the time of registration, an anti-Japanese aid-to-overseas-Chinese relief fund equivalent to 10% of the loan value will be collected. Upon completion of registration, certificates will be issued allowing their sale. However, if Japanese goods paid for by merchants and stored between July 14th and July 24th are transported and sold without registration, and are discovered by this committee, an anti-Japanese aid-to-overseas-Chinese relief fund will be collected at twice the rate, and registration will be supplemented. (3) For those who purchase and transport Japanese goods after July 24th, all goods discovered will be confiscated. Even if the purchased goods were purchased before July 24th but are not registered with the committee within the specified time, they will also be confiscated if discovered. (B) After registration of each item, various trade associations should store them in one or two warehouses and send a letter to this committee. The committee will, together with the Chamber of Commerce, send personnel to inspect and verify them clearly. Each item will be marked with a seal separately, allowing it to be transported and sold. If export is desired, the relevant trade association can send a letter to this committee to apply for a permit. The permit will be stamped and issued by this committee together with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for mutual verification. After the goods arrive, the recipient should first report to the local anti-Japanese association and chamber of commerce for inspection and registration before they can be picked up. In the future, if any unregistered goods are found, they should be detained and confiscated as anti-Japanese aid-to-overseas-Chinese relief funds. It was further resolved that the following information should be clearly stated in the registration form under the remarks section: (1) Goods marks, (2) Numbers, (3) Warehouse where stored.</p>
<p>▲Design Meeting: The Design Committee of the association held its first meeting yesterday. Committee members Chen Songyuan, Li Wenjie, Xu Yongzuo, Kui Yanfang, Pan Xulun, Chen Haiqiu, Zhou Jingzhai, Wu Zhihao, Zhu Wenqi, and Xue Guangqian attended. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Request the government to order the Customs Administration to clearly indicate the country of origin when importing foreign goods to prevent Japanese people from fraudulently claiming other origins. (2) Establish a coordination committee as soon as possible. (3) Regarding industrial raw materials and daily necessities that cannot be replaced in practice, standards should be established first. This matter should be handled by the association sending a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to establish a research committee for resisting Japanese goods as soon as possible, to conduct detailed research and establish standards, and then submit them to the association for reference. (4) Japanese goods that have been seized and paid for before July 14th should be handled according to the registration measures. (5) This association should immediately, together with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, invite representatives from various industries, and also invite hometown associations and the Red Cross, which are related to overseas Chinese, to quickly raise donations to provide relief and condolences. (6) Invite those with expertise in diplomacy from the anti-Japanese association to set up a diplomatic research committee to study countermeasures against Japan and provide them to the diplomatic authorities. (7) Telegraph the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications to expedite the transportation of domestic coal and Chinese raw materials to reduce the import of Japanese coal. (8) Discussed the opinions of Committee Members Chen Songyuan and Kui Yanfang. It was resolved that the above eight proposals were all passed and recommended to the Executive Committee. (9) Appointed Committee Members Li Wenjie and Zhu Wenqi to draft the association's organizational charter. It was resolved and passed. (10) Decided to hold the third meeting at 1:00 PM on Saturday, convened by Committee Member Li Wenjie. It was resolved and passed.</p>
<h3>Warnings to Mr. Feetham from Various Circles</h3>
<p>▲For His Opposition to Inspecting Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The National Society stated that the Third District Branch of the Kuomintang and various trade associations in this city voiced their opposition to the remarks made by Mr. Feetham, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Declaration of the Third District Branch: Recently, we read in the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" a statement by Mr. Feetham, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, in which he considered our people's boycott of Japanese goods illegal and stated that he had ordered the police to strictly suppress it. This is incomprehensible. We have observed that Japanese imperialists have spared no effort in their aggression and oppression against our country. Recently, the Wanpaoshan incident, in which our people's land was forcibly occupied, and the instigation to massacre overseas Chinese, have particularly aroused the boiling blood and indignation of our countrymen. Therefore, people from all walks of life have expressed their patriotic enthusiasm and voluntarily organized the Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Committee to advocate permanent economic severance with Japan. The inspection and detention of Japanese goods are naturally necessary actions during the period of economic severance. Now, Mr. Feetham not only fails to support our citizens' legitimate actions with justice but instead considers them illegal and further interferes and suppresses them. His absurdity has reached this point, which shows that British and Japanese imperialists are birds of a feather. The May 30th Massacre is a clear proof of this. Although a weak country has no diplomacy to speak of, fortunately, our people's spirit is boiling and sufficient to break through the sky. If Mr. Feetham implements his absurd suppression actions, then our Chinese citizens will only turn their determination against Japan and apply it to Britain. We hope that Mr. Feetham can wake up and automatically correct his mistakes so that Chinese-British friendship will not be broken. Otherwise, although our country is weak, our people's spirit is not diminished, and we will lead the citizens to deal with him with severe means. This is our declaration. Please be informed. Executive Committee of the Third District Branch of the Kuomintang of Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>
<p>▲Warning from Various Trade Associations: Twenty-one groups, including the Shanghai Taxi Industry Association, issued a warning to Mr. Feetham yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, according to a statement published in the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", you consider the inspection and detention of goods by those who boycott Japanese goods as illegal actions and state that you have ordered the police to strictly suppress them. This nationwide anti-Japanese movement was initiated by the Japanese massacre of overseas Chinese in Korea and is entirely a voluntary proposal of the people. As for the goods detained by the Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Association, they are all owned by Chinese merchants and are detained because they violate regulations. It goes without saying that this is a legitimate action. What you said is obviously unreasonable. We hereby issue a serious warning, please wake up and do not obscure your conscience and act as an accomplice. Otherwise, our people will regard the imperialists as the same front and will naturally deal with them with severe means. Which one to choose, please think twice. Respectfully to Mr. Feetham, Shanghai Knitted Goods Industry Association, Shanghai Department Store Industry Association, Shanghai Refining Industry Association, Shanghai Taxi Industry Association, Shanghai Egg Industry Association, Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association, Shanghai Local Goods Industry Association, Shanghai Chinese and Western Furniture Store Industry Association, Shanghai Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Goods Industry Association, Shanghai Ash Factory Industry Association, Shanghai Chinese Woolen Factory Industry Association, Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association, Shanghai Lime Transport and Sales Industry Association, Shanghai New Drug Industry Association, Shanghai Electrical Appliance Industry Association, Shanghai Wool, Warp, Silk, and Dyeing Industry Association, Shanghai Western Pigment Industry Association, Shanghai Homespun Industry Association, Shanghai Soy Sauce Store Industry Association, Shanghai Flour Industry Association, Shanghai Duck Slaughtering Industry Association, and dozens of other associations."</p>

<h3>Madam Soong's Coffin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲Soong Tzu-wen and Others Arrive on the Ship Together</p>
<p>▲Reburial to Take Place in One or Two Weeks</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Soong Tzu-wen, accompanied by his sons Tzu-liang and Tzu-an, and others, arrived on the customs cruiser Haihsing with Madam Soong's coffin from Qingdao yesterday morning at 7:10 AM at the Taikoo Wharf.</p>
<h3>Coffin of Madam Soong is Transported from Ship to Vehicle (Photographed by Our Newspaper)</h3>
<p>Madam Soong's coffin was immediately transported to the Soong residence on Seymour Road for temporary placement and to begin the mourning ceremonies. Mourners are arriving in droves, and carriages are constantly coming and going. The details of the coffin's arrival in Shanghai are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Wharf Security: Around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, over a hundred Annamite soldiers and the entire team of Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched by the French police to the vicinity of the Taikoo Wharf to maintain security and drive away idlers. The intelligence team of the Garrison Headquarters and armed police officers from the Public Security Bureau stood at the entrances and exits of the wharf with guns, creating a serious atmosphere. Those entering and exiting in plain clothes were required to wear funeral badges, effectively turning the area into a special zone. The Municipal Bureau sent a team of soldiers, and Director Chen Xizeng was on the scene to direct everything. In addition, Huang Renlin, the director-general of the Nanjing Lishi Society, and others came to Shanghai to assist with the arrangements.</p>
<p>▲Family Welcoming: At 6:40 AM, Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi, accompanied by his wife Soong Ai-ling, and Madam Chiang Soong Mei-ling, Madam Soong Tzu-wen, and their children, arrived at the Taikoo Wharf in separate cars. Kong was wearing a Xia cloth long gown with a black armband. Madam Soong Mei-ling and her sisters, as well as their children, were all wearing black cloth robes, black gauze stockings, and black gauze shoes, with sorrowful expressions. Because it was still early, the ladies rested in the cars for a while. Before long, Mayor Zhang and his wife also arrived together.</p>
<p>▲Haihsing Arrives: At 6:50 AM, the customs cruiser Haihsing, all in gray, with black smoke billowing, was clearly visible. A mournful melody was played simultaneously, as if lamenting. Madam Soong Mei-ling and others rushed to the wharf, lined up, and gazed from afar. As the cruiser passed, all Chinese and foreign vessels in the river lowered their flags to half-mast to show their condolences. It was not until 7:10 AM that it docked properly.</p>
<h3>Family Members Line Up to Greet at the Wharf (Photographed by Our Newspaper)</h3>
<p>▲Prayers on the Ship: At that time, Minister of Finance Soong Tzu-wen, dressed in Western attire with a black armband, was leaning against the deck and nodding to the Kong family and others. Madam Soong's coffin was at the rear of the ship, surrounded by wreaths. Soon after, Madam Soong Mei-ling and others boarded the ship, along with the pastor who accompanied Soong and members of the church. They held a prayer service on the ship for about ten minutes.</p>
<p>▲Coffin Transported Ashore: The Wan Guo Funeral Parlor was responsible for the coffin's transportation. A large car was prepared, along with ten coffin bearers, all wearing newly made blue cloth long gowns. The parlor owner personally supervised them. At 7:30 AM, the ten bearers carried the coffin ashore. The parlor owner held a picture of Jesus and led the way, followed by the brothers Tzu-liang and Tzu-an, dressed in moon-white cloth robes, then Soong Mei-ling, Soong Ai-ling, and Kong Xiangxi, and finally Soong Tzu-wen, escorted by armed guards.</p>
<p>▲Paying Respects to the Deceased: The coffin proceeded straight along Avenue Edward VII and arrived at the Soong residence on Seymour Road at 8:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Funeral Shed at the Soong Residence on Seymour Road (Photographed by Our Newspaper)</h3>
<p>A funeral shed was erected in front of the house. The coffin was placed in the main hall, and a family memorial service was held. Pastor Jiang Changchuan performed a prayer, and the family surrounded the coffin in silent prayer and paid their respects to the deceased. The undertakers from the Wan Guo Funeral Parlor had previously travelled to Qingdao to perform surgery on Madam Soong's body, so her appearance was lifelike.</p>
<p>▲Mourners Arriving: Yesterday morning and afternoon, people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, came to pay their respects in an endless stream, including Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Xing, Guo Dehua, Guo Biao, Guo Chengen, Zheng Yuxiu, Du Yuesheng, and over three hundred others. According to the funeral director, the coffin is planned to be kept for one or two weeks before the funeral is held on a later date and buried at Hongqiao Road.</p>
<p>▲Customs Flies Half-Mast: Customs Superintendent Tang Haian accompanied Minister Soong to Shanghai yesterday morning and went to the Soong residence to assist with the funeral arrangements. The Jianghai Customs flew its flag at half-mast to express its condolences. The naval cruiser arrived at the Wusongkou the night before last at 10:00 PM, weighed anchor and entered the port at 5:00 AM yesterday morning, and arrived at the wharf at 7:10 AM.</p>

<h3>Further News on the Hankou Flood</h3>
<p>▲Severe Losses to Merchants and Goods</p>
<p>The Yangtze River flood was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, various shipping companies in this port continued to receive telegrams from Hankou stating that the flood situation was even worse and the disaster was more serious. The various points heard are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲River Continues to Rise: The Yangtze River water level is normally 17 to 18 feet. The shallowest point this year was 11 feet. This time, the heavy rain has not stopped, and the water level has been increasing day and night. On the 27th, it was 46 feet 6 inches, which was unprecedented. Unexpectedly, on the 28th, it rose another 3 feet. At that time, most of the roads in Hankou were flooded. Unexpectedly, that night, it rose another 2 feet, reaching a water level of 52 feet 5 inches yesterday, which is the largest flood in the Yangtze River in the past six or seventy years.</p>
<p>▲High Warehouses also Submerged: The Hankou telegram on the previous day stated that the water along the bank had risen to the streets, and the higher warehouses built by the various shipping companies had not yet been affected, while the rest were submerged. Various shipping companies were trying to unload the lower-level goods and move them to higher ground. Unexpectedly, the water rose sharply that day, and by the night of the 28th, the higher warehouses were also completely flooded, and more goods were damaged by the water. In addition, traffic was obstructed due to the flooding of various roads, making rescue efforts difficult to implement.</p>
<p>▲Goods Blocked Upstream: The goods coming to Hankou on the Yangtze River are all from upstream ports, such as Shashi, Yichang, and Changsha, Xiangtan, and the goods from various ports on the Pinghan Railway are transferred to Shanghai. Since the 27th, the joint transportation of goods on the Pinghan Railway has been blocked by the flood, and no goods have been loaded. Goods from Shashi, Yichang, and other places have also been blocked because they cannot be unloaded. Therefore, the downstream goods of various Yangtze River ships have suddenly decreased.</p>
<p>▲Grain Transported to Hankou: The food supply in Hankou has been affected by the flood. Recently, the Hankou merchants have sent telegrams to Shanghai one after another to purchase food and transport it to Hankou to provide relief to the people. A large amount of foreign rice and wheat flour has been purchased in Shanghai in recent days. Yesterday, the Dehe De Lun ship loaded 7,477 bags of white rice, and the Datong Lun and Wuchang Lun ships transported another 2,411 bags. A considerable amount of wheat flour was also loaded and transported.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhang's Talk</h3>
<p>▲Splitting Business Tax with Jiangsu Provincial Government</p>
<p>▲Second Batch of Land in the Central District to be Released</p>
<p>▲Hopes Anti-Japanese Association Will Strictly Observe Discipline</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mayor Zhang Qun yesterday regarding the Jiangsu Provincial Government's request to the Executive Yuan to allocate the revenue from the business tax of the two municipal governments of Nanjing and Shanghai, with the province receiving 70% and the city receiving 30%, and the issue of land in the central district. He asked for his opinions as follows:</p>
<p>▲Assisting with Business Tax: Mayor Zhang said that after the Municipal Government of Shanghai received the order from the Executive Yuan to consider the issue of the business tax assisting the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it had already reported the difficult-to-assist situation to the Executive Yuan based on reason. There are three reasons why it cannot assist: First, administratively, the Shanghai Municipal Government is an independent municipal agency, different from others that are subordinate to the provincial government. All municipal construction depends on the revenue of the city, and the development of the entire city depends on it. Therefore, in reality, there is no surplus capacity to assist. Second, Shanghai has a special relationship with the concessions. The taxes and levies that all other provinces and cities have are unique to Shanghai and cannot be implemented. For example, in the past, the Municipal Government planned to levy a wine and banquet tax, but it could not be realized due to the restrictions of the concessions. At present, what the municipal treasury relies on to supplement is still the old tax revenue from the past, which has been rectified. Although it seems to have increased slightly compared to before, all future construction and development of the Municipal Government require funds. Therefore, it is considered that the only hope is the income from the municipal business tax. The amount of income from the municipal business tax, however, is not only impossible to determine before collection, but also impossible to estimate. Moreover, the tax rate in Shanghai is lower compared to other provinces, with the highest being only 3 per thousand. In the future, when collecting taxes, although Chinese merchants in the concessions will all recognize paying taxes as a due obligation and enthusiastically agree, the Municipal Government must also consider their burdens. Chinese merchants in the concessions cannot be exempt from paying all miscellaneous taxes in the concessions just because they have already paid the business tax to the Municipal Government. For example, recently, the hotel industry in the concessions has requested to use capital as the basis for tax collection, and the Municipal Government cannot but consider it. In the future, foreign merchants in the concessions will naturally also be included in the collection. However, foreign merchants also have the obligation to fulfill their corresponding obligations to their home government. Under these circumstances, the Municipal Government seems to need to be considerate. Therefore, the income from the municipal business tax in the future is still difficult to predict due to various special circumstances. Third, what is taken from the people should be used for the people. I still remember that when preparing for the business tax, someone said that Shanghai would collect the business tax in the future, and the Chinese area would naturally not have much problem, but the taxpayers in the concessions only have the obligation to pay taxes and have no rights to benefit. If the concessions collect the business tax, the Municipal Government should pay attention to the interests of the taxpayers in the concessions. His words are very reasonable, but the Municipal Government has never excluded the citizens of the concessions from the benefits of the citizens. For example, education and sanitation are provided to the citizens of both the Chinese and concession areas with equal benefits. Therefore, in the future, the Municipal Government will still use the revenue from the business tax for the people, adding schools and sanitation facilities to seek happiness for the citizens. The Greater Shanghai Plan and other plans all rely on this income. Therefore, the request of the provincial government is in fact impossible.</p>
<p>▲Continued Opening of Land: This time, the land reclamation in the central district involved more than 800 mu. Careful consideration was given beforehand to ensure comprehensiveness and meticulousness. However, it was unexpected that citizens would reclaim land so enthusiastically. This is indeed a good phenomenon of citizens' faith in the government. At the same time, the worry that no one would register to reclaim land has been easily replaced by an unusually joyful feeling. In the original plan of the Municipal Government, registration would come first, followed by lottery, and those who drew first would reclaim first, to avoid disputes. Unexpectedly, on that day, the Land Bureau reported that those who were reclaiming land were rushing to be first, and someone temporarily called others to the Land Bureau to help draw lots. Therefore, I temporarily decided to set the standard of reclaiming a certain amount of land with a certain amount of funds. Therefore, some people were inevitably disappointed. As for the land reclaimed by the Shanghai Bank, it was also a combination of multiple people drawing lots, and there was no other relationship. After this issue occurred, I once summoned the Shanghai Bank for questioning. It is indeed not a trust. The outside world's rumors are actually a misunderstanding. At present, the Municipal Government plans to use the land reclamation funds immediately for the construction of trunk roads and ditches in the central district. At the same time, 540 mu in the northwest of the central district will be reopened. The reclamation method will be reversed from the previous regulations. First, each person will only reclaim one mu, then each person will reclaim two mu, then three mu, and then four mu. This will definitely avoid the disadvantages of incompleteness.</p>
<p>▲Attitude Towards Anti-Japanese: He then talked about the citizens' Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Association implementing the detention of goods, saying briefly that he deeply sympathized with the citizens' patriotic enthusiasm, but hoped that all actions could be within the scope of the law, not exceeding the boundaries of the track, and could use the personality of self-respect and respect for others to carry out a disciplined and orderly movement.</p>

<h3>Measures for Inspecting Weights and Measures in the Concession</h3>
<p>▲Already Agreed Upon Through Negotiation by the Authorities</p>
<p>The inspection of weights and measures in this city is divided into four phases: the first phase is the Hunan District, the second phase is the Zhabei District, the third phase is the Concession District, and the fourth phase is the Four Townships District. Inspections have already been implemented. Regarding the inspection issue in the Public Concession, Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Feixin Dun, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, have negotiated and generally agreed. As for the inspection procedures, a consultation was held at the Municipal Government's After-Hours Club on Weihaiwei Road at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 28th). Those present included Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Hengru, the Section Chief, Zhou Zanming, the Director of the Weights and Measures Verification Institute, Feixin Dun, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, and Mao Ding, the Chief Inspector. The results of the consultation are as follows: (1) Regarding the inspection of weights and measures in the Special District, the Social Affairs Bureau will order the Weights and Measures Verification Institute to designate five inspectors to handle it. (2) Inspectors must carry an execution inspection certificate with their photo attached and stamped with the seal of the Weights and Measures Verification Institute. The Social Affairs Bureau will send the format of the inspection certificate to the Municipal Council in advance for distribution to each police station for record-keeping. (3) If police stations encounter inspectors holding inspection certificates requesting assistance with inspection, they should immediately dispatch police to assist. (4) Matters regarding penalties for violations of laws and regulations will be transferred to the Special District Local Court for handling. It is said that the initial inspection will adopt a method of persuasion, setting a time limit for compliance with the new instruments.</p>

<h3>Bloodshed on Killarney Road</h3>
<p>▲Zhou Chunsheng Dies Tragically from Gunshot</p>
<p>▲Seemingly a Homicide Due to Adultery</p>
<p>At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhou Chunsheng, a native of Suzhou residing in the rear building of No. 32 Guangyu Lane on Killarney Road in the French Concession, was suddenly assassinated and killed by thugs with a gunshot. His concubine, Hu Zhou, was also seriously injured at the same time. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Subletting Spare Rooms Qiao Hanzhou, a 37-year-old Suzhou native, is engaged in the tailoring business. He married Guo, who is currently 34 years old. Qiao is naturally frugal and has some savings. Eight years ago, he rented No. 32 Guangyu Lane on Killarney Road in the French Concession and became a sublandlord. In addition to opening his own Qiao Hanji Tailoring Shop in the front downstairs room, all the remaining rooms upstairs were sublet to others.</p>
<p>▲Operating a "Swallows' Nest" Qiao rented the front building to a newspaper vendor named Chen Jinbao and the attic to a Mr. Shi. The remaining rear building was only rented to Zhou Chunsheng (No. 31), a native of Hengjing, Suzhou, on the 14th of this month. The rent was set at seven and a half yuan per month. Zhou had a concubine, Hu Zhou (27 years old, from the same hometown as Zhou), who moved in with him. When renting the room, Zhou claimed to the sublandlord that he intended to temporarily open a "swallows' nest" before renting a small house to live in.</p>
<p>▲Three Shots Fired Zhou and his concubine moved in, Zhou left early and returned late every day, while Hu Zhou stayed at home all day without taking a step beyond the threshold. At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhou and his concubine were still fast asleep, neck and neck in bed. The downstairs shop door had just opened, and the apprentice was sweeping when suddenly a thug wearing a dark blue Xiangyun gauze short jacket and trousers and a straw hat broke in, rushed upstairs, and burst open the rear building door. Upon seeing Zhou and Hu Zhou still sound asleep, he took out a pistol and fired three shots at the bed.</p>
<p>▲Unsuccessful Pursuit of the Murderer At the sound of the gunfire, one bullet hit Zhou's left temple, and another hit Hu Zhou's right breast. Hu Zhou was awakened by the injury and witnessed the murderer fleeing downstairs in a panic. Hu Zhou hurriedly chased downstairs with her wound. At the same time, the sublandlord was startled awake and ran barefoot out the door, intending to help with the pursuit. However, the murderer turned back and threatened Qiao with a gun. Qiao became timid and dared not pursue further. The murderer then calmly left the alley and fled south towards Tangjiawan without a trace.</p>
<p>▲Husband Dead, Wife Wounded Qiao turned back and saw blood streaming from Hu Zhou's chest. He immediately hired a car to report to the Songshan Road Police Station. The police chief ordered Hu Zhou to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment and dispatched detectives to the scene of the incident for investigation. Zhou Chunsheng had already died due to the fatal wound. His body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall morgue for examination. It was discovered that the deceased had no family members in Shanghai. Subsequently, the Criminal Division of the French General Police Department reported to the French Concession Court Judge Zhu Chengshen, who arrived at the morgue at 2:00 PM to confirm that Zhou Chunsheng had been assassinated. The detective then reported the previous events. After the judge questioned the sublandlord, he ordered the body to be photographed and taken into custody by the morgue pending the police's arrest and investigation of the murderer.</p>
<p>▲The Concubine's Account According to Hu Zhou, she and the deceased, Chunsheng, had previously opened a "swallows' nest" in the front building of No. 107 Annakin Road in the French Concession and were planning to move to Guangyu Lane to continue the business. Unexpectedly, this accident occurred. She had only known the deceased for a short time. As for the murderer, he resembled a familiar fellow villager named Chen Caifa. The reporter's investigation revealed that the case was mostly caused by adultery, resulting in a murder due to jealousy.</p>
<h3>Disruption of Yangtze Ferry Operation</h3>
<p>▲Delaying More Than Two Thousand People's Work for One Hour</p>
<p>▲Shipping Bureau Agrees to Investigate and Negotiate Compensation</p>
<p>At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, water police officers stopped the Yangtze ferry from crossing the river, causing a disturbance among more than two thousand male and female workers gathered on the shore. Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team learned of this and immediately dispatched police to the scene to quell the situation. The details are recorded as follows: The Yangtze ferry started operating at the Qichangzhan Wharf. After the construction was completed, it shuttled back and forth across the river, transporting workers to and from factories, carrying approximately thousands of people each day.</p>
<p>At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, when the ferry was docked near the Qichangzhan Wharf in Pudong, fully loaded with workers on the wharf built along the riverbank, it was preparing to set sail to Puxi. At that time, Water Police Officer No. 78 suddenly arrived, claiming that the number of passengers on board exceeded the quota and prohibiting it from crossing the river. The ferry then checked and found only forty-two passengers, arguing that it did not exceed the prescribed limit and still requesting permission to sail. However, the police officer insisted on refusing, causing a delay of about one hour. Consequently, workers had gradually gathered on the shore, numbering over two thousand. Because they could not cross the river, they were late for work. They all believed that the police officer had unreasonably prevented the ferry from sailing, and the crowd became angry, causing a disturbance. Dozens of female workers, in particular, felt indignant and swarmed forward, dragging the police officer to the Gonghexiang Wharf and berating him. Seeing this situation, the ferry was deeply afraid of causing a major disaster and immediately sounded a distress call, emitting several loud wails. Nearby boatmen, unaware of the truth, became panicked. This was heard by Liu, an officer of the Lujiazui Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, who immediately dispatched several senior police officers to rush to the scene to quell the situation, which was then calmed down. By this time, the Water Police Station had also learned of the incident and immediately dispatched personnel to the scene to comfort the workers. Police Officer No. 78, knowing that he could not withstand the public's anger, took the opportunity to sit alone in a sampan and rushed back to the Yangshupu Sub-station of the Water Police. At this time, more than two thousand workers, because the time for entering the factory had passed, could not enter the factory to work. The loss of one day's wages was substantial. They demanded that the ferry transport all the workers to the Water Police Station for negotiations. The entire crew of the ferry, fearing further incidents, after earnestly persuading the crowd, jointly traveled to the Jianghaiguan Shipping Bureau with two patrol boats of the Water Police, where the workers demanded that the bureau quickly seek compensation from the Water Police for the losses incurred due to the unreasonable delay in going to work. At that time, both sides deliberated repeatedly, but there was still no result. Finally, the bureau agreed to wait for an investigation of the cause of the incident before further processing. The workers were then gradually transported back by the ferry, and the disturbance temporarily came to an end. The ferry owner, Chen Songtao, and others, after the incident, presented a request to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, stating that the Shanghai Water Police's unreasonable obstruction of navigation, obstruction of traffic, and delay of workers' time to work had aroused public anger and almost caused a major disaster, and that such behavior would have a significant impact on future business operations. Therefore, they requested that the Bureau find ways to protect them in order to prevent future troubles.</p>
<h3>Huang Chujiu's Assets to Be Auctioned by Public Advertisement</h3>
<p>▲Based on the Highest Bid</p>
<p>▲Huang's Assets Awaiting Investigation</p>
<p>The case of the Shanghai Riyue Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department going bankrupt was heard again by the French Concession Court yesterday afternoon. First, accountant Pan Zhaobang reported on the change from bidding to liquidation, stating that Huang's family, after being ordered to clear the assets by the accountants, submitted a public list through Huang's family's lawyer, Tan Yigong, stating that Huang's real estate and movable property totaled several million, and even movable property alone was worth hundreds of thousands. Unexpectedly, when the goods were delivered, all the pearls were found to be extremely small and yellow, and the utensils and other items were worth no more than several hundred yuan in total, which was vastly different from the amount reported by lawyer Tan. He requested verification. Tan Yigong, the lawyer representing Huang's family, requested that the previous court order for bidding be cancelled. Yu Chengxiu, the deputy lawyer representing the creditors' rights and obligations lawyer Wu Jingxiong, stated that the case had been in litigation for a long time, and the creditors had only received 10% of their rights. After the previous court order changed the bidding to liquidation, various disputes arose, with articles competing to be published in newspapers, with thousands of words. The creditor side was very distressed by this kind of pointless dispute. Huang Chujiu was both a director and manager of the Gongfa Company, occupying the position of a natural debtor. After the previous court order for liquidation, his representative lawyer Tan Yigong publicly submitted a property list report stating that Huang had total assets of more than six million, which made all creditors very happy. Unexpectedly, according to the accountant's report, the assets were only worth more than 1.7 million, a difference of four to five million, and even this 1.7 million was not a real figure. Upon hearing this, all the creditors felt as if cold water had been poured on them, which was very disappointing and caused dissatisfaction. The previous court order to change the bidding to liquidation was supported by all creditor representatives, who still requested public advertisement for bidding in order to close the case as soon as possible. Lawyer Jiang Yiping also stated that the winning bidders from the previous bidding were now suing the accountant in the Special District Court, requesting a public letter from the court to prove that the two biddings were actually abolished by the court's decision, to avoid the accountant being implicated due to public affairs. Lawyer Zhu Shuzhen also stated that he also represented some of the creditors, and that now there were rumors among thousands of people outside that Huang's family had only handed over a portion of the property after receiving the court order for liquidation, and that a large portion of the property was hidden and not handed over. According to the accountant's report, only a few hundred yuan worth of jewelry was handed over in terms of movable property. Huang Chujiu could be called a wealthy man, so how could he only have this meager jewelry? He requested the court to order Huang's family to hand over the majority of the property. Lawyer Yan Luqing also stated that Huang's family still had a large number of diamonds and other items that had been mortgaged to others. He requested the court to summon the case for questioning. There was also the matter of the Wanchun Silver Group contract, which was somewhat unclear and should also be investigated in order to close the case as soon as possible. After the lawyers debated for a long time, Judge Gong issued an order stating that the request from Huang's family to revoke the court order of July 18 was opposed by all the creditor representatives, and that the previous court order to abolish the two biddings should still be followed. The accountant was allowed to join with the various representative lawyers to advertise for public bidding, with the highest bid as the standard. Some creditor representative lawyers also stated that the accountant should investigate and report the situation of Huang's family concealing property.</p>
<h3>Legal Opinion on Tan Yigong Lawyer's Clearing of Huang Chujiu's Assets (Continued)</h3>
<p>(4) Legal Points Regarding the Handling of Huang's Debts: The debts left by Huang Chujiu refer to private debts (such as Huang Chujiu's household in Riyue Bank with more than one million, and other mortgage and borrowing debts of nearly two million) and debts incurred from business operations (such as the share to be borne when the partnership property of Gongfa Company is insufficient to pay debts, and debts from other sole proprietorships or partnerships). Huang Chujiu's private debts to others are even greater than the debts owed to Great World and Riyue Bank, etc. under Gongfa Company. Whether or not the debts are recognized, waived, or reduced is not something that the liquidator of Gongfa Company can handle. Using Huang's entire property to repay Huang's entire debt is even more inappropriate to entrust to the liquidator of Gongfa Company, who represents only part of the creditors, to dispose of and distribute the entire property alone. Because Huang's entire estate has been determined by the court to repay all the debts he owed privately and from operating businesses, the total amount of money obtained from selling the property should be paid off separately to those with priority rights, liens, and mortgage rights according to the total amount of all debts, and then distributed equally to ordinary creditors. The debts owed by Huang Chujiu's household in Riyue Bank and Great World are one of the ordinary debts, and should be paid off equally with other ordinary creditors, without any superior rights, which is very obvious.</p>
<p>(5) Legal Points Regarding the Interference of Gongfa Company's Creditor's Representative Lawyer in the Disposal of Huang Chujiu's Estate: Huang Chujiu has two positions in Gongfa Company: one is as a shareholder, and the other is as a debtor of the Riyue Bank Great World under the company. Regarding the shareholder status, he should be in the same position as other general shareholders. Before Gongfa Company is completely closed and it has not been proven that all the partnership property is insufficient to pay off debts, he is not responsible for any liabilities. As for the debtor status, the creditor of his business is Gongfa Company, not the creditors of Gongfa Company. Therefore, the creditors of Gongfa Company and their representative lawyers have no direct creditor-debtor relationship with Huang's estate, and naturally have no right to participate in and interfere with Huang's estate. Moreover, the liquidation affairs of Gongfa Company have long been assigned by Junxie to accountants Pan and Wu as liquidators to represent their rights. If the creditor representative lawyer has any opinions and claims, they can contribute and request Pan and Wu. If they believe that Pan and Wu are not sufficient to protect the rights of the Gongfa Company's creditors, they can also request Junxie to provide legal relief. Moreover, clearing Huang's estate and clearing Gongfa Company are two completely different matters. The creditor representative lawyer of Gongfa Company cannot interfere with the clearing of Huang's estate, just as Huang's private creditors can only claim against Huang's family and Huang's representative lawyer, and cannot interfere with the clearing of Gongfa Company. Putting it another way, it is very clear. However, the creditor representative lawyers Dong Yu, Dong Chi, Chen Zhigao, Jiang Yiping, etc., either interfered with the bidding process, causing disputes, or criticized the bidding methods approved by Junxie, requesting changes, and even said that Huang's estate had already been handed over and that Huang's family and Huang's representatives should not interfere. The biggest mistake is that they regard Huang Chujiu as Gongfa Company, and regard Huang Chujiu's estate as Gongfa Company's property. Whether the lawyers have other opinions, I dare not comment, but it can be asserted that the lawyers have no legal grounds to interfere with the clearing of Huang's estate.</p>
<p>(6) Legal Points Regarding Wu and Pan Accountants Being Appointed as Liquidators of Gongfa Company, Simultaneously Representing the Court to Take Care of Huang's Estate, and Being Ordered to Handle Huang's Estate Together with Huang's Family Representatives: According to the order of Junxie, accountants Pan and Wu are the liquidators of Gongfa Company. With this qualification alone, they have no right to interfere with Huang's estate. The reason they can participate in clearing Huang's estate is that they were also appointed as custodians of Huang's estate and were ordered by Junxie on March 30 to discuss solutions together, standing in the position of supervising and assisting Huang's clearing. Since the accountant has several qualifications as a natural person, the general creditors of Gongfa Company mistakenly believe that the accountant can use the qualification of the liquidator of Gongfa Company to dispose of Huang's estate, resulting in unnecessary disputes. Gongfa Company and Huang are in a position of relative creditor-debtor relationship, and the liquidator of Gongfa Company should focus on the interests of Gongfa Company as their task. Since the interests are biased, it will inevitably have an adverse impact on Huang's family and his private creditors. The fact that the accountants announced the bidding in the name of the liquidator of Gongfa Company, and did not discuss solutions together with Huang's representative, but reported to the court and published the advertisement alone to negotiate the sale of Huang's estate, and never mentioned Huang's private debts from beginning to end, is sufficient to prove this. In order to avoid misunderstandings and show impartiality, Junxie should revoke one or two of the accountant's qualifications and appoint another person to take over in order to clarify the boundaries and quell disputes.</p>
<p>(7) Points Regarding the Methods of Handling Huang's Estate and Distributing Debts: Since Huang's entire estate has been approved to pay off all debts, for the sake of Huang's family and Huang's creditors, it should be closed as soon as possible. Based on the current situation, solutions are proposed separately as follows: (1) Real estate: (a) The first batch of real estate bid out includes a total of six properties. Except for the ownership of the Fang Dan property, which is still under investigation, and the Xicang Road property, which has been reviewed and decided to be re-bid, the remaining three properties, the Jiu Fu Company on Baike Road, the Xinghua Restaurant on Simalu, and the Yi Jia property, are more significant. The bid prices obtained are not far apart. Since they have been reviewed and determined and the winning bidders have been notified according to law, in order to maintain the court's authority, it seems appropriate to allow the bidder with the highest bid amount to win the bid in order to stop litigation and avoid complications. (b) For those whose first and second bids have not been reviewed and determined, Huang's liquidator should be allowed to advertise the highest bid publicly for purchase, and the reserve price must be above the highest original bid price. If a reasonable price is still not obtained for the first time, the advertisement should be published for the second time, and the reserve price must be above the previous highest bid, with the highest bidder as the winner. This public bidding can increase the value, so that creditors can benefit more and show fairness to dispel outside rumors. When publishing the bidding advertisement, the contract relationship and advantages of each real estate should be attached in detail to attract buyers' attention. All methods for implementing the bidding should be subject to the approval of the supervisors. (2) Disposal of movable property: Since a portion has been sold by the liquidator of Gongfa Company, the remaining portion should still be handled in the same way by the liquidator, selling it by auction with a reserve price. The amount of the reserve price must first be approved by Huang's liquidator. (3) Disposal of most of the sole proprietorship stores: Since a portion was previously sold by the liquidator of Gongfa Company, the remaining portion should still be handled in the same way. (4) Method of collecting, paying, and storing money: Since all the estate is sold in succession, the money from the sale should be jointly issued a receipt by the supervisor and Huang's representative, stored in the banks designated by Junxie, the checks should be kept by Huang's liquidator with two seals for withdrawing money, one held by the supervisor designated by Junxie and the other held by Huang's liquidator. Both parties must seal together before payment can be made. At the end of each month, a detailed statement of receipts and payments should be prepared, reported, and published in the newspaper to reduce the responsibility of all parties. Since the amount of money coming in and out is very large, it is not enough to value social credit without mutual strict responsibility. (5) Method of distribution: After all the estate has been sold and priced, the total amount of Huang Chujiu's private debts and debts from operating businesses should be repaid separately to those with priority rights, mortgage rights, and liens, and the remaining ordinary debts should be distributed equally, assisted by the supervisor and Huang's liquidator. (6) Method of closing: After all the estate is sold and priced and distributed to the various debts, the supervisor appointed by the court and Huang's liquidator should each submit a final report to the various courts for record and announce the closure of Huang's liquidation. The report should also be sent to all relevant parties for their information. The remaining items with no value that cannot be sold (such as Gongfa Company stocks) should still be returned to Huang's family for storage. In summary, as this lawyer's duty, I dare not remain silent and specially list my views, requesting Junxie to review and approve them as soon as possible, which would be in the public interest.</p>

<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Orders Gongfa Company Liquidators</h3>
<p>▲Liquidation and Bidding... Handle Impartially</p>
<p>▲Great World Sale Price... Distribute Promptly</p>
<p>Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang, the two accountants, recently submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau on the general situation of handling the liquidation of Gongfa Company and the process of disposing of the company's affiliated agencies and Huang Chujiu's sole proprietorships. The Bureau stated that the disposal of Huang Chujiu's estate had caused disputes between bidding and liquidation, leading to creditor-debtor disputes. It has ordered the two accountants, Pan and Wu, to handle the matter impartially, without any favoritism, to avoid criticism. The sale price of Great World is 700,000 yuan, which can be paid off by the end of this month. Therefore, it also ordered the two accountants to promptly distribute the money collected from the sale to all depositors in Riyue Bank and Great World Amusement Savings Department. If the amount is insufficient to pay off the debts after distribution, the number of deficiencies should be pursued and compensated from the shareholders and directors of Gongfa Company in order to protect the legal interests of the creditors. They are also ordered to report the handling situation, along with the receipts and payments, to the Bureau at any time for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shiming's Deceased Concubine Appeals Again on the Issue of Mother-Son Relationship</h3>
<p>▲Zhang Qu'an Must Appear in Court</p>
<p>▲Zhou Miaoying Will Not Make Things Difficult</p>
<p>Zhou Miaoying, the former concubine of the deceased wealthy Nanzun businessman Zhang Shiming, filed a lawsuit through lawyers Yuan Yang'an, Zhang Zirang, and others to confirm her mother-son relationship with her son, Qu'an, because she was not consulted when he got engaged and married. The defendants, Zhang Qu'an and Zhang Xu Shi (Zhang Shiming's legal wife), also hired three lawyers, Zhu Sisti, Jiang Yiping, and Cai Ni Pei, to defend them, claiming that Zhou had already received 40,000 yuan and severed her family ties. As for Zhang Qu'an, they acknowledged Zhou Miaoying as his biological mother. As a result, Zhou Miaoying lost the case. Zhou appealed to the High Court, and the court had summoned them once before. However, because neither the appellant nor the appellee appeared in court, the court adjourned the hearing and ordered both parties to appear in person. Yesterday morning, the High Court's division chief, Hu Yigu, along with judges Li Mo and Ye Zaizhou, and clerk Qian Qizhong, resumed the hearing in the Second Civil Court. The appellant, Zhou Miaoying, reported her presence, but the appellee still did not appear. First, the appellant's lawyer stated that since the appellee had not appeared today, they should be arrested in accordance with the Civil Code and the Judicial Yuan's interpretation. Furthermore, the lawyer argued that the case details should only be presented when the appellee was present to avoid hurting feelings. The appellee's lawyer, Cai, stated that there was no real need for the appellee to appear in court, and that the appellant's lawyer knew this but insisted on their presence to embarrass them in public. Moreover, the lawyer argued that since the appellant had received 40,000 yuan and had lost her status, she could not file another claim. Judge Hu immediately stated that since the appellee had already acknowledged the plaintiff as his biological mother, why was there a need for her to appear in court again? Lawyer Zhang replied that it was for the convenience of reconciliation. Judge Li also declared that since the appellee had already acknowledged the appellant as his mother, why was she filing a lawsuit to confirm their mother-son relationship? If she wanted to assert her rights, that was a different issue and not within the scope of this case. The judge added that it would not hurt for the appellee to appear in court once and that it would be better to have him confront her at the next hearing. Lawyer Zhu Sisti then stated that Zhang Qu'an was not unwilling to appear in court, but he was afraid that the appellant would intercept him and cause a disturbance in or outside the courtroom, so he dared not appear. If the appellant did not engage in such behavior, he would definitely appear next time. Lawyer Zhang stated that they would definitely not make things difficult for the appellee. Judge Hu then adjourned the hearing and announced that they would wait for Zhang Qu'an to be summoned to court for verification.</p>

<p>At around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, a barefoot madwoman, approximately in her twenties, wearing a bean-paste-colored wool georgette cheongsam, a white cambric shirt and pants with frills, and a black satin gauze vest, suddenly appeared in Renmei Lane, West Xinjiao Street, French Concession. A young man, claiming to be her husband, followed behind. They walked to the street-crossing building at No. 1 in the lane and sat down on the ground. The man tried to persuade her to leave the alley, but the woman had a major nervous breakdown, spouting nonsense. She began taking off her clothes one by one, even attempting to remove her undershirt and pants. The man forcibly stopped her, and she began rolling around on the ground, covering herself in mud and filth, making a stinking mess. She kept arguing and making noise all night, grabbing onto passersby and food vendors, preventing the residents of the entire lane from sleeping. After dawn, when the garbage trucks entered the lane, residents opened their doors to empty their chamber pots. The madwoman saw the back door of No. 1 Zhizhong Lane wide open (this back door opened into Renmei Lane) and rushed in, bolting the door shut and sneaking into the bedroom. The cleaning lady of the house saw her and was shocked. The man outside the door, unable to enter because the back door was bolted, explained the situation and forced the door open. After great effort, he managed to carry the madwoman out, but she immediately lay down on the ground again. Moments later, she sneaked into the back door of No. 2 Renmei Lane, climbed up to the attic, closed it tightly, and lay down on the floor. The man tried to enter and drag her out, but the door was locked and he could not get in. He borrowed a ladder from a neighbor, climbed in through the window, and with great effort, dragged the madwoman out. In a short time, a large crowd gathered in the lane. Onlookers advised the man to hire a car and take her to a hospital for treatment. Afterwards, someone familiar with the madwoman said that she was 27 years old, from Wuxi, and had previously run a brothel in the French Concession, with three "persons to ask for" (i.e., girls). She had accumulated some savings but had spent it all on a man (the one who accompanied her to the hospital). Both of them were addicted to opium, and now they had run out of money and the prostitutes had also escaped one after another. This had caused her to suffer a mental breakdown.</p>
<h3>Warning Signs Erected on the Wusong Seaside</h3>
<p>▲Advising People Not to Drown Themselves</p>
<p>The Wusong Municipal Committee Office, recognizing that many aimless young people often come to Wusong to commit suicide by drowning, and that the causes are nothing more than economic oppression and heartbreak, which lead to meaningless sacrifices in the vast ocean among countless living beings, decided to find a way to help. They produced ten warning signs and erected them along the coast so that those contemplating suicide would see them and be awakened, turning back as soon as possible. Yesterday, they sent staff to survey the locations and erect the signs, from Yunzaobang Bridge to Fort Taiwan. The slogans used were all contributed by various organizations. Here are some excerpts: "Only by living and struggling can you solve your problems!" "Failure is the mother of success; suicide is the act of the weak." "Why care so much for a heartless person? Heartbreak is your happiness; why do you need to die?" "You die for him/her, and he/she laughs at your foolishness. You must not die; see how foolish he/she is!" "Don't get it wrong; it's easy to seek death, but hard to seek life. Turn back quickly!"</p>

They set the date for the second meeting as next Wednesday (at 7:00 PM sharp), to be convened by the standing committee members at the Hua An Hotel.</p>
<h3>The Current Status of the Trust Department of the Continental Bank</h3>
<p>▲Manager Shen's Remarks</p>
<p>Since the Continental Bank established its Shanghai Trust Department in December of last year, engaging in various trust businesses, it has achieved remarkable results in the past six months. The end of June this year marked the end of the first half of the year for accounting purposes. All fixed-term trust deposits with a term of two years or more were allocated a dividend of 3.5%, which, together with the guaranteed interest, resulted in an annual interest rate of at least 1.15% and at most 1.45%. This high level of profit is unmatched by ordinary bank fixed-term deposits. Mr. Shen Erchang, director of the bank and manager of the Shanghai Trust Department, discussed the fundamental differences between trust deposits and ordinary bank fixed-term deposits as follows: The trust business originated in England and flourished in the United States. The English system focuses on managing property for others, while the American system focuses on utilizing funds for others. Both manage property for others at the same time. The German system falls between the English and American systems, and the Japanese system follows the German model. In our country, the trust business is just beginning to emerge, and there are no trust laws yet. Our bank, which also handles trust business, has been approved by the ministry and operates carefully based on precedents from various countries and taking into account our country's circumstances. Trust matters are fundamentally different from banking matters. A bank's profits mainly come from interest, remittance fees, and exchange rates, with other types of income being minimal. Legal restrictions prevent banks from directly engaging in industry and commerce, so the profits are derived solely from providing capital to industry and commerce and collecting interest. Therefore, the level of bank interest rates is closely related to industry and commerce. To promote the prosperity of industry and commerce, bank lending rates should not be too high, and deposit rates are naturally subject to related restrictions. Banking associations in various countries often have agreements on interest rates. Trust business is generally divided into managing property for others and utilizing funds for others. The former is completely different from banking business, while the latter is similar to but fundamentally different from bank fixed-term deposits. Although the methods of utilizing funds in the trust business vary from country to country, direct investment is openly permitted. Japanese trust law stipulates the buying and selling of movable and immovable property, with more than twenty types of movable property specified by the Ministry of Finance, including all the goods needed for social life. Therefore, the profits from utilizing funds in the trust business include both capital interest and enterprise profits. The guaranteed interest on trust deposits is the interest due on capital, and the dividends on trust deposits are the profits earned by the enterprise. Therefore, the position of a trust depositor is equivalent to making a direct investment and receiving both types of profits. The trust department distributes all profits to the depositors after deducting expenses according to regulations. This is the fundamental difference between trust deposits and ordinary bank fixed-term deposits. One cannot compare the benefits of trust deposits with bank deposits by comparing the eye of bank deposit. The original interest rate set by the department for trust deposits was 7% guaranteed interest for a two-year term, with an additional 0.5% per year for each year beyond two years, up to 1.1% guaranteed interest for a ten-year term. Accounts are settled every six months, with the same dividend distributed regardless of the length of the term, and paid out once a year after the annual settlement or compounded in advance with compound interest. The department is still in the process of expanding the profit rate of enterprises to meet the expectations of the trustees. According to the original interest rate set by the department, there is a difference of 4% between the minimum and maximum guaranteed interest rates. Although the terms are divided into two and ten years, the general opinion of depositors is that the guaranteed interest on trust deposits seems slightly lower at 7% for a two-year term and too high at over 1.1% for a ten-year term when compared to the interest on bank fixed-term deposits. It is hoped that the department will make some corrections, so that if the department's business gradually develops in the future, the dividend may be higher than 3.5%, which will not reduce the long-term income, while slightly increasing the short-term income, avoiding the difference of 4% between the highest and lowest interest rates. The department should consider the above opinions and may make slight changes to the highest guaranteed interest rate from the beginning of 1932, while not reducing the lowest guaranteed interest rate. In Japanese trust companies, interest on trust deposits is paid every six months. The department considers a six-month term too short for sufficient flexibility in utilizing funds, which may lead to imbalance. However, the method of paying both principal and interest together upon maturity, common for bank fixed-term deposits, is not suitable for those who need a fixed income every year. Therefore, the department has considered the two and decided to settle accounts annually at the end of the year and pay out the guaranteed interest and dividends together. Those who need it can budget for their annual income, and those who do not can accumulate compound interest year by year, with the aim of maximizing the benefits for the depositors and increasing the department's responsibility for social service.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Trust Company Expands Its First Model Village</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Trust Company, in order to solve the housing problem for residents of Shanghai, specially developed forty acres of land on Jiangwan Road and sold it in sections to the public. People from all walks of life, recognizing that the area was close to Hongkou Park, with fresh air and convenient transportation, bought it all up within ten days. Now, due to insufficient supply, it has purchased more than two acres of vacant land for further expansion. This time, it is still being sold in sections, with only three sections remaining, each approximately four fen, which is ideal for building Western-style residences. The Jiangwan property is being influenced by the city center and is developing rapidly, with land prices increasing day by day. It is indeed difficult to find a place with such low prices and such a beautiful location as the company's First Model Village.</p>

<h3>Ill-Fated Lovers</h3>
<p>▲Due to Economic Pressure</p>
<p>▲Husband and Wife Commit Suicide by Poisoning</p>
<p>Cai Aisheng, a local resident living at No. 148 Kang Nai Tuo Road, was found dead by his mother, Ms. Xu, at around 11:00 AM yesterday morning. Ms. Xu entered Aisheng's room to wake him up, only to find her son and daughter-in-law, Ms. Shen, lying side-by-side, unresponsive, and with pale faces as if they had been severely poisoned. She immediately reported to the Ge Deng Road Police Station, and the Xinzha Fire Brigade ambulance transported the two to Bao Long Hospital. However, they were already dead upon arrival. At around 3:00 PM, the bodies were transferred to the Fei Lun Road morgue for an autopsy. The deceased, Cai Aisheng, was 26 years old and previously worked in the bamboo industry but was currently unemployed. His wife, Ms. Shen, was only 19 years old. It is said that their suicide was due to economic pressure. After Aisheng lost his job, he struggled to make ends meet and had to borrow money to survive, leading to a mounting debt that he could not repay. He resorted to this extreme measure and committed suicide by poisoning.</p>
<h3>Wu Ailian Declines to Judge the Beauty Pageant</h3>
<p>The beauty pageant organized by Ming Yuan originally invited Ms. Wu Ailian and Ms. Guo Anci as judges. Subsequently, the Women's Relief Association sent letters to both ladies, stating that this event would damage the dignity of women and requesting them to withdraw immediately. Ms. Guo had already resigned a week earlier, considering the matter resolved. These details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Ms. Wu Ailian took the same stance as Ms. Guo at the time and had also already resigned from her position as a judge.</p>
<h3>A Scene from a Sibling Lawsuit</h3>
<p>▲Born of the Same Root</p>
<p>▲Why Must You Torment Each Other So Harshly?</p>
<p>The late construction contractor Yu Jintang had a son named Yu Zhenmin, also known as De Bao. In that year, he acquired a house in Zhabei, Jinling Road, and named the lane after De Bao. He also had a daughter named Yu Zhenhua, who was ten years older than Zhenmin. In 1927, Jintang passed away. At that time, Zhenmin was young, and all the family affairs were managed by Zhenhua. Relying on her control of the family fortune, she became addicted to gambling. Last year, Zhenhua married a dentist, Mr. Li, and Zhenmin was also about to get married. Before the wedding, Zhenhua drew up a property division agreement, dividing her father's house in the Chunyin Lane on Ge Deng Road and the house in De Bao Lane in half. Although her husband was not a live-in son-in-law, she invited Mr. Li to live with them. Zhenmin could not bear this, so he sued her in the Special District Court to reduce the payment, determine the payment schedule and account details, and allow him and his wife to move out. The court has summoned her several times. Zhenhua, unaware that she was adopted by the Song family, falsely claimed that her brother was not a Yu. She also refused to pay the monthly average rent of 379 yuan from the two houses on Ge Deng Road and Jinling Road, only giving her brother 2.4 yuan last month and nothing this month. Yesterday, she was summoned to court again. The plaintiff's lawyer requested in court that the property division agreement be revoked. The manager of the Wufengzhuang Bank presented the account books, proving that on December 1, 1930, a bill of exchange numbered 26787 from Dingkangzhuang, worth 9,000 yuan, was personally deposited by Li Yu (i.e., Zhenhua) into Wufengzhuang the next day, secretly changing the account name to Song Yueji.</p>

<h3>The Founding of the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory</h3>
<p>Chinese medicine is based on five thousand years of practical experience and is a great synthesis. Therefore, its great effectiveness and proven usefulness are sufficient to serve as the foundation for twentieth-century scientific medicine. If the Chinese medicines obtained from ancient experience can be reformed to remove the outdated and unrealistic theories since the Jin and Yuan dynasties, and improved and elucidated based on the latest scientific medical principles and using physicochemical pharmaceutical methods, they will surely be welcomed by the global medical community. The international academic status can also improve steadily. In 1921, Mr. Li Pingshu, Yu Botao, Wang Zude, and Zheng Pingshu, recognizing this, took the improvement of Chinese medicine as their responsibility and founded the Cuihua Pharmaceutical Factory in Shanghai. After three years of hard work and sacrificing hundreds of thousands of dollars, they had to stop due to circumstances and aspirations. Mr. Zheng Pingshu, with a spirit of perseverance, poured all his personal wealth into starting the Guohua Pharmaceutical Factory, hoping to continue the unfinished business, but it also stalled due to unfavorable circumstances.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1929, several lay Buddhists under the contemporary eminent monk Master Taixu, having long heard of Mr. Zheng's reputation and sharing the same aspirations, gathered funds of 100,000 yuan in national currency and planned for two more years to complete the preparations. The company was named "Foci Grand Pharmaceutical Factory Co., Ltd." The company is about to open, and it is said that it will focus on (1) scientific research on Chinese medicines and (2) scientific manufacturing of Chinese medicines.</p>

<h3>The Life of Working Women in New York (9)</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Clara Shi ate her lunch with great relish. She never lightly dismissed the joy of occupying a part of New York. She was a true city girl, pretending to possess it all, but her inclinations leaned towards music, crowds, frivolity, and laughter.</p>
<p>She spent a full hour eating her meal, then leisurely smoked a cigarette. Originally, she didn't like smoking, but at a charity event in a hotel, she saw many young women with cigarettes in their mouths, almost none of them not smoking. Many of her cigarette-buying customers were women. She felt smoking was a fashionable thing. She didn't inhale the smoke.</p>
<p>After lunch, she had to go back to work. George was coming this afternoon. George was a salesman who came to this hotel every week. Because he liked Clara Shi, he often took her out to eat. He was a generous spender, but people always felt he was a bit odd. He talked endlessly about business, but rarely mentioned his own affairs, except once when he emotionally talked about his mother. Clara Shi imagined he must be married. Once, she asked him this, but he didn't answer. She realized it was better not to ask.</p>
<p>When the afternoon began, she was already watching for him. He was very different from many people who came to the hotel. He seemed very happy to be friends with her, but not overly intimate. Clara Shi sometimes complained that all men were the same. George told her that she only saw the worst aspects of them.</p>
<p>"These men are mostly peaceful and family-loving in their daily lives. But when they come to New York, they are like children on vacation from school, and they have to do something."</p>
<p>Finally, George came in through the large revolving door. He gave the luggage he carried to the waiter, and then went straight to where Clara Shi was standing. He looked truly happy to see her. He said they would have dinner at seven o'clock.</p>
<p>Clara Shi felt very happy for the rest of the day. She treated customers with joy, making them feel that she seemed to be very happy in her job. By six thirty, she had nothing to do. Now she felt she wanted to buy that black crepe dress. The price of the dress was $19.75, which was five dollars more expensive than the clothes she usually wore. But anyway, her curly hair was always so lovely. She had her hair permed once a week, at a cost of $1.50. She felt it was very worthwhile.</p>
<p>She and George met in the hallway of a nearby hotel, because it was not very appropriate to see him in the hotel where she worked.</p>
<p>"Your funny face," George said, "Where shall we go to eat?"</p>
<p>"Wherever you say," she replied. She knew that the phrase "funny face" was a bit of George's affection for her.</p>
<p>"How about going to the California Wanderer Restaurant?"</p>
<p>"Ah, George, that's great!" This place was a bit far from the city and was truly a superior place, with beautiful music, elegant scenery, and excellent food. It took a car ride from the city. Clara Shi thought it was very extravagant. Besides, there was nothing wrong with sitting in a car with George.</p>
<p>The two people talked about nothing but unimportant jokes in the car. Clara Shi was very good at arguing. After about half an hour, they arrived at their destination. A doorman hurried to the car. How happy Clara Shi was for this little attention. All day long, she saw others enjoy this kind of compliment in the hotel lobby. Now, she actually received it herself. She also hoped that they would pick her up wearing evening dresses. She had a dress with beaded trim at home, and a light-colored scarf. The color was too light for this weather, but she felt it would be lovely if she wore it.</p>
<p>They picked a table for two next to the dance floor. Clara Shi swayed gently in the middle of the music. She ordered many delicacies. Ah, she also knew how to pretend to be a noblewoman. She and George got up to dance, glanced at other tables, and saw if anyone noticed her. She felt very happy because someone was indeed noticing her. Her heart fluttered up and down, which was truly what life was all about.</p>
<p>At half past eleven, George suggested they should go home. Clara Shi turned her head and smiled, "Yes, it's not good to stay here too long."</p>
<p>In the car going back, Clara Shi curled up and leaned towards George, wanting to be protected by him. But he did not accommodate her.</p>
<p>"Good night, kid," were his parting words. When she got to her room, she took off her shoes and didn't know how to spend the rest of the night. She thought to herself, taking her home at this time, the night was not deep. Ah, God, men treat Clara Shi as if she were a joke, or only show a little friendship. Of course, she didn't want rude companions, but she wanted George to give her something other than dinner and dancing. She wanted to marry someone like George, but they didn't mention marriage to her. Oh, she was just a cigarette girl.</p>
<p>Because she felt unhappy, and because she didn't make herself comfortable, she took off her clothes and crawled into bed. She really hated going home so early when her companions hadn't returned yet. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Fierce Competition Between British and Japanese Yarn Industries</h3>
<p>Unfolding in China, India, and Southeast Asia</p>
<p>According to the Dongbao Newspaper, the competition between the British and Japanese yarn industries has intensified in China, India, and Southeast Asia since the British Eastern Yarn Industry Inspection Group returned home and agreed on countermeasures. Recently, a certain British company has sold a large number of rayon fabrics in Rangoon. One of these companies has the support of the Imperial Bank of India and uses the position of a special colonial bank. At the same time, relying on the deep recession, it adopts long-term settlement methods, taking advantage of harsh trading conditions. British yarn industries are also depreciating prices, and shipping companies are reducing freight rates, seeking tax-free entry and exit to various parts of the Far East. On the other hand, Japanese textile companies are engaging in freight reduction movements in order to compete, or secretly planning to establish a British-Japanese-Indian trade alliance, etc., to cope with the situation. In particular, Zhong, Japan, Toyo, and Fuji Yarn Factories are dedicated to correcting the defects in the market transactions they have already obtained, reorganizing finances, and further expanding the market. They have set up trading markets in major commercial ports such as China, Annam, the Straits Settlements, India, and Myanmar, and signed consignment contracts with merchants to facilitate transactions. In the future, the competition between British and Japanese yarn industries will become more intense.</p>

<h3>Uncle Liu San</h3>
<p>— Li Chunsen</p>
<p>—School Play Collection, Volume 1—</p>
<p>Compiled by Gu Zhongyi</p>
<p>The school drama movement has indeed made progress this year. Almost all universities and middle schools have school drama groups. In the first half of the past 20th year, the entire life of the drama movement was simply supported by small-scale performances by school drama groups. It seemed that, except for a few young students who dedicated themselves to cultivating the field of dramatic arts, most people were disheartened. The misfortune of this kind of unhealthy drama movement itself must be injected with the new sap of youth. The author of Uncle Liu San also said in the preface,</p>
<p>The Chinese drama movement in recent stormy times is elusive, sometimes sinking and sometimes appearing. The future is vast, and it cannot but make those who work hard feel discouraged, passive, wait-and-see, and transformed. The efforts of many people, the management of decades, still see society highly praising the old dramas performed by Mei Lanfang, Ma Lianliang, and others. The future of new dramas is, as usual, "not optimistic." The momentum of new dramas is still "ill-fated."</p>
<p>From this point of view, he himself has certainly been rebuffed. The only thing he hasn't despaired of is his interest in the school drama movement. Let's see what the author says,</p>
<p>However, it cannot be said that there are no achievements at all. The rise of school drama is an undeniable fact. It is the only achievement of the drama movement in the past few decades. These achievements are cultivated among students who are full of vigor, good at responding to changes, and also reflect the final success of the Chinese drama movement in the future. The barren and barren Chinese society, in its current situation, is afraid that it has no hope of cultivating bright and splendid flowers of art. The school's garden, although small, is abundant and fertile, and has great potential for development. Therefore, our promotion of the school drama movement is indirectly promoting the entire new drama movement. Before we can immediately make achievements in society, let's first lay a foundation in the school. We don't need to be disappointed, discouraged, or at a loss. Let's all come to school to cultivate!</p>
<p>Indeed, young students accept the dramatic arts the earliest, and their future achievements must rely on them.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu has worked hard and the publication of the first collection of school plays is not a sign of the development of the school drama movement's future.</p>
<p>This collection contains a total of five short plays. Except for "Uncle Liu San," which is an original work, "Everyone Wins," "Seven Bodhisattvas," "Outsider," and "I Love the Dawn" are all translated and adapted. According to the editor in the preface, the compilation method of each collection is,</p>
<p>"In terms of materials, we strive to be diverse and broad, so that they can be adapted to various special schools, groups, and roles. In terms of writing style, we strive to be simple, easy to speak, and easy to understand. In terms of compilation, we originally planned to translate half and create half, but the editor was limited by the lack of time for creation and could not but take more existing foreign materials and adapt and supplement them to become concrete Chinese dramas. Sometimes the original work is too good, and the editor is unwilling to reluctantly translate it, so it is translated directly word by word to preserve its original style and charm as a rule."</p>
<p>Uncle Liu San depicts a character who values friendship. The opening scene first shows the epitome of a naughty child, which is Liu San's son, Guangzu, pacing boredly in front of the door. Coincidentally, his father's friend Zheng Ermazi escaped because he killed a bastard company commander in the camp. At this moment, there were chasing soldiers behind him, but Zheng Mazi had already been shot, and he was hungry and exhausted. He said that he could be saved if he went to Liu San's house. Who knew that because he had said something about Guangzu in front of Lao Liu, Guangzu made fun of him. He was just cunning and refused to hide him. Even when he was told about righteousness, he couldn't be moved. In the end, he was given two silver dollars as a benefit to tidy things up. After a while, the chasing soldiers came and asked him about Zheng Ermazi's whereabouts, but Guangzu still answered jokingly. Even when threatened, he was still calm, as if nothing had happened. Later, the platoon leader used the method of profit to lure him, sending him a silver watch as a price, and the result was success. But just when Zheng Ermazi was tied up, Liu San and his wife came back. He knew the details of the matter, and his face was already full of shame. When Zheng Ermazi scolded "A man is not worth dying, just don't be a traitor who sells friends," his inner conflict reached its extreme. After they left, he began to beat Guangzu, no matter how he begged for mercy, he finally died under Liu San's gun.</p>
<p>Speaking of Liu San's character, he is completely a Jianghu hero. Look at what he said,</p>
<p>"My grandfather, Liu Taigong, was a provincial governor and saved a few friends in the Jianghu who fell into the grass and became bandits. My father was willing to be cut in the waist for the sake of his brothers' righteousness. As for me, who doesn't know my name, Uncle Liu San, because I always put my friends in front and my personal feelings behind. Okay, okay, you have lost all of Uncle Liu San's face. You are the first traitor in my Liu family who is ungrateful. Living is also a disgrace to the ancestors." (Page 21) "Everyone Wins" is a play about a couple quarreling. The characters here are two couples, Ge Daocun and Wu Songzhen, Tao Sifan and Tang Yunhe. Yunhe felt that when she loved her husband very much, she was very serious about everything she asked for. Later, when she learned that her husband was not a god and had things he couldn't do, she kept quarreling with him. Later, in order to avoid quarreling, she used means to do everything he wanted, but love had flown out of the window. This time, Songzhen and her husband were playing at Yunhe's house, but they quarreled with her husband until she cried. Yunhe took this treasure to teach Songzhen, and Songzhen did what Yunhe said, but she was not happy, and she completely said it. When Daocun went to tell Sifan, he wanted to force her to quarrel with him, because this way he could get true love. Who knew that the motive for the quarrel could not be aroused, and he had no way but to threaten her with an affair. In the end, she failed, and so for a small matter, she quarreled again seriously. At this point, the curtain fell.</p>
<p>This seems to be a technique for controlling a wife, but in reality, love is really difficult to handle. Generally, people think that love after marriage is very difficult to maintain. This is the main theme of this play. This is based on Ida Lubleshi Ehjlich's Winners All and adapted.</p>
<p>"Seven Bodhisattvas" is a three-act play, written about seven beggars who dressed up as seven Bodhisattvas. Because they had no business, they saw the seven Bodhisattvas carved on the green rocks of Mama Mountain, and they were greatly worshiped by passers-by, so they came to use them. They stole three green embroidered robes, dressed up, and first went to the market to promote, saying that there was a prophecy in an old classic that the seven Bodhisattvas on Mama Mountain were going to be dressed up and enter the city. As a result, they succeeded. The citizens worshiped to the extreme. Everything they had never eaten before, they were now eating. But in the end, they could not dispel the citizens' doubts. The citizens sent people to Mama Mountain to investigate, but just when they couldn't even dream of it, the real Bodhisattvas came from the mountain and enlightened the seven beggars. When the citizens realized that their bodies were already cold, they thought it was because of their suspicion that the Bodhisattvas had turned into stones. This shows the foolishness of the world's worship. The original author of this play is Lord Dunsany's Gods of the Mountain.</p>
<p>"Outsider" depicts a husband, Bao Baye, who is very irritable and puzzled because his wife has an affair. In the middle, the comicality of the great doctor is inserted. The characters here are all incomplete. Bao Baye's soliloquy at the opening is the summary of the whole play.</p>
<p>"I am the most unfortunate man in the world. I have a wife who really bothers me to death. Not only can she not take care of the housework and make the home clean, clear, comfortable, and make me happy, but she also makes me lose my temper twenty times a day. She is not at home for a few days, running around everywhere, eating big meals, taking cars, and associating with those unscrupulous friends. Alas, poor Bao Baye, what a poor husband you are. But I have to clean her up. If I kill her, ... that won't work, then my life will not be guaranteed in the future. If I put him in jail, ... that won't work either, this slut will find a way to escape ... It's really terrible, what should I do ... " (Page 109)</p>
<p>This play is based on Moliere's The Salonwyof he Barbouille and participates in Chinese materials.</p>
<p>"I Love the Dawn" writes about how young men and women regard love as a toy. They were originally a close couple, but unexpectedly a rift occurred due to the accidental encounter with a poet and a woman. The girl fell in love with the poet at first sight, and the boy was equally enthusiastic about the woman. From then on, they thought that they should go their separate ways. They all felt a new excitement, which was more meaningful than the former. But they changed again in less than a week. They saw through the poet's and woman's pranks, and then they made up. A cobbler is inserted here, and he is present in every scene, and there is such a song in every scene,</p>
<p>"Love and I are very good,"</p>
<p>Until one day (fate) is exhausted, ——</p>
<p>Beautiful, brave and free, ——</p>
<p>I love and I are terrible,"</p>
<p>His words and actions are all lovely. He seems like a good teacher. Modern young people are all asking for love. They fantasize about a happy dream, but when they get love, they will feel dissatisfied. The result is that they make up trivial branches. This common morbid state is strongly implied in this play. This play is based on Adelaide C. Rowol's short play.</p>
<p>In summary, these four translated short plays have certainly achieved considerable success, but it cannot be said that they are completely flawless. It is precisely because these plays do not have much characteristic features, the plot is very simple, and there are also places that are worth discussing in terms of thought and skill. As for the various advantages, there are certainly many. However, I don't want to talk about it at this moment.</p>
<p>The content of the script has been roughly said, so if we take this book to dedicate to the drama groups of various schools, I personally still think that it is not very satisfactory. As mentioned above, our script is to adapt to the special environment of young students. Among the five short plays in this collection, except for "Uncle Liu San" and "I Love the Dawn," which still have some merits, the three plays "Everyone Wins," "Seven Bodhisattvas," and "Outsider," if they are performed on stage, I believe that there will be a strong sense of hesitation, but in the school drama aspect, it does not seem to be very necessary. I hope that in the next nine collections, we can make more contemporary school drama scripts. This is what we are looking forward to.</p>
<p>Finally, let's borrow the words of the author's preface to end this article,</p>
<p>"The drama movement is a career that can only be run by the cooperation of many people, and the most popular school drama movement that is being created needs the support of a group of loyal supporters ... Let's all work hard, cultivate, irrigate, and support this small flower of art."</p>

<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>▲The Shanghai Electro-Therapeutic Clinic proclaims that the rapid progress in the medical field in recent years is truly astonishing. The precision of drug therapy is already known worldwide, while physical therapy has emerged as a dark horse, achieving remarkable feats and showing a tendency to surpass drug therapy. Germany and Japan have made considerable advancements in the research and implementation of this therapy. However, it seems that the medical community in our country has remained silent on this matter, which is regrettable. Now, Dr. Chen Yanbing, a specialist in physical therapy who studied in Japan, recognizing the lack of this therapy in the country, has purchased a large number of sophisticated electrotherapy devices from abroad. He has established the Shanghai Electro-Therapeutic Clinic at 198 Old Baizi Road in this city, allowing patients from all walks of life in our country to benefit from the "sweet dew" of 20th-century physical therapy. The clinic has now opened and is offering free medical treatment for one month, it is said.</p>
<p>▲The renowned doctor Zhang Chenglu of Hankou possesses profound medical knowledge and is particularly skilled in pediatrics and obstetrics. Having practiced in Shanghai for over a decade, he has saved countless lives. In recent years, he has been practicing at No. 1 Dunren Lane, Marlang Road, in the French Concession. Those seeking treatment are constantly at his door, especially those coming from Zhabei. Dr. Zhang, concerned about the suffering of the poor and sick in traveling back and forth, has recently secured premises at No. 13 Hexing Lane, Xiangshan Road, Zhabei, to establish a branch clinic. The hours are set from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM. At the main clinic in the French Concession, he will be available from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, after which he will be at the Zhabei branch clinic, it is said.</p>
<p>▲The traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Zhou Zhilin proclaims that since the beginning of summer, the erratic climate has made people susceptible to illness. Currently, many people in the city are suffering from fever, headache, diarrhea, and coughs. Many cases of these symptoms have been successfully treated by the traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Zhou Zhilin. Mr. Zhou now has a clinic at Beixing Lane, at the intersection of North Nicheng Bridge and Xinzha Road, offering consultations in the mornings during the summer. His book, "Practical and Effective Prescriptions for Internal and External Medicine," can be obtained by sending a letter with a four-cent stamp for postage, it is said.</p>
<p>▲The Corden Trading Company proclaims that "Mathesin," the world-renowned and effective cure for gonorrhea and syphilis, is the latest invention of the German medical saint Dr. Adina. The tablets are purely made by electrolysis, hence their great efficacy. Whether for new or old cases of gonorrhea, it is effective after six hours of administration. This medicine can quickly cure and permanently eradicate severe cases of chronic gonorrhea that have not responded to surgery or injections. This company is the sole agent for the Far East, and the medicine will arrive in Shanghai soon, it is said.</p>
