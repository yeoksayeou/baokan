<h3>五國代表集議</h3>
<p>討論内容嚴守機密</p>
<p>調解工作迄無進展</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今晨英法德意西五國代表在議長室内集議、自十一時半起至十二時三刻止、散會後各代表面有憂色、新聞記者趨問之、則以討論嚴守機密爲答、僅有一代表謂行政會或將於明日開會耳、至於是否公開會議、則未說明、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今晨日代表團語路透訪員、東京訓令今日可到、同時辦理滿洲事件之行政會委員會英法德意西代表五人、於午前十一時集議於議長室、研究時局、及在接到中日復電以前所可行之步驟、有數國外交當局及重要代表迄未到日内瓦、頗感不便、西班牙外長勒樂因國内多事、不能出京、意外相格蘭第刻在羅馬準備游德、而德總理兼外長白魯寗又忙於國事不克離柏林、幸英法外交當局尙留在（日内瓦、）日總代表芳澤今晨乘汽車赴日内瓦郊外游玩、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政會議長白里安今日總括國聯關於滿洲問題工作、謂乃需時頗久之事、現或有少許進步、但甚緩云白里安以全力代表國聯行政會辦事、但截至目前、迄未得迅速解决滿洲爭端之根本辦法、東京復文現尙未到、故今日談話無大發展、英外相李定語晤白里安、力言從速結束談判之必要、今晨白里安之重要隨員訪日代表芳澤、午後芳澤見國聯秘書長德魯蒙、聞芳澤與國聯秘書長所談者、仍與國聯手續問題有關、日政府答白里安建議之復文、大約明晨方可到此、屆時行政會將舉行非公開之會議、中國請求英美出兵滿洲之說、此間負責方而絶無所聞、日代表團亦否認芳澤曾發此說、謠傳殊屬可笑、倫敦來電亦謂英官塲否認有此消息大約此說成由日内瓦傳出、但非路透社所傳出也、今日中國代表團宣佈張學良發來十月十七八兩日日軍砲擊溝帮子附近、十八日日飛機向通遼擲落炸彈之電報、中代表團聲明東京五項要求尙未接到、故彼等毫無所知、日代表團不欲批評此項要求、惟謂芳澤與白里安現正沿此輪廓進行談判云、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　前數日劉於理事會之樂觀、今日巳不復可見、國聯中人亦認滿案反見惡化、現此間盛傳美國務卿史汀生贊成日本不規定撤兵時期之要求、雖此說猶未見正式證實、但局勢已爲之突呈嚴重、今晨五大國代表續開會議、由白里安報告迄今努力斡旋之進步情形、美代表吉爾伯未列席外間對此頗重視、認爲今晨之會、殆僅討論根據國聯會章之行動而非根據非戰公約規定公斷之行動、當開會前、中國施總代表又送公文致理事會、據稱、係非常重要而秘密之報告、内容關於中日滿洲爭執之全局、（二十一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>完全國貨立勃絡髓上海南市虹橋福康西藥店製</h3>
<p>功效·補血變質强壯。藥方，以國文載明仿單内。</p>
<p>比較，有簡易試騐法印送（仿單試法可先寄）</p>
<p>本。藥爲一種有機鐵化合物。恰如「食物内之鐵，於小腸吸收後，與生質精結，合而存於肝臟内，以備增補血色素及赤血球之用者」相同的人工物。補　極效。更能發育各組織。亢進新陳代謝。可使全身健旺。體重增加。皮膚佳良。凡急性慢性等血虧，神經衰弱，皮膚慢性病，病後未能復元，婦女月經不調，萎黄病，小兒發育不良等，均效甚，與外國上特製品無稍異，而價比廉甚。每大瓶　售一元四角，大人約可服十六七天，願國人比較之。此藥係特别化合，與普通補血鐵劑不同，故過胃不生變化，至腸即可吸收，奏效甚速，而無害胃腸。惟特異性人，及病有咯血吐血之勢者，仍以忌用爲是（凡藥之含鐵或　等，均宜注意禁忌者）</p>
<p>行政院非公開會議報告、本日情形大要於次、（一）日本代表交由報紙發表之節略、語意和緩、其所注意實以鐵路問題爲最要、（二）據私人方面由華盛顿傳來消息、互相矛盾、據云史汀生并未抛棄採用制裁方法之意見、又云、史氏贊成立即開始交涉、而反對限期撤兵（三）中國以國聯會盟約爲根據、凡所提出之要求、不能有何讓步、白里安提交行政院之建議、若果如外間所傳、對於南京爲日人要求安全保障、其範圍或逸出原來狀况以外、則時局情形、仍可變爲嚴重、原因近日以來日本堅持不讓日内瓦人士已大不謂然、茲日本若作若干讓步、行政院自必要求中國出於妥協之途、南京如果拒絶、行政院恐亦不無怨言、（二十一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>日本接受白里安之建議</h3>
<p>行政會或將在巴黎重開</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　路透社探悉芳澤已接到東京訓令接受白里安關於日本所提出五要點之建議、日本原主張中國必須在原則上承認此五點、然後日軍方可退入鐵路區域、白里安則建議日本應抛棄以中國須承認日本鐵路權、爲開始談判先决條件之要求、聞白里安將設法破除因日本拒絶定期撤兵而起困難、擬於星期五或星期六日暫停行政會會議、而於三星期内再開會於巴黎、料想是時日軍當已全撤、</p>
<p>（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日國聯中人忽接中日政府正在談判滿案之訊、於是中國總代表施肇基博士立即加以否認、鄭重聲明中國除在國聯理事會範圍以内、絶對不與日本成立任何協定、並向各理事保證中政府苟直接接到日本提議、悉將轉達理事會、二十日國民社電</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今夜此間已有懷疑國聯理事會明日或將不再舉行秘密會議者、因日　若能如一般希望接受撤兵原則、理事會立將休會二三星期、而下次開會或將改在巴黎舉、在休會期間、仍委白里安與中日政府密切接觸居中斡旋、至有開會必要時、再由白氏召集特别會議日代表芳澤在今日深夜猶在守候東京新訓令、料其請訓即係白里安對於覓致同意基礎上之建議、聞星期一夜間日代表團曾奉東京訓令、不必收拾行裝、蓋即準備取消離開日内瓦之前令、所以表示日本無意退出國際、此間自白里安向中日代表接洽、雖已引起若干樂觀、但觀於種種報告、日本依然佔據滿洲、其軍隊仍淹留不撤、一般觀察時局者多謂日本仍與國聯會章及非戰公約居於抵觸地位、理事會苟不能迅謀解决、則將危及國際聯盟在和平機關中之價値、目下主要問題已不在中日間、而移至日本與國聯間、惟日本對於美國參加、仍堅持法律方面之抗議、僅因接白里安函後暫行保留至相當時間仍將提出、（二十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今晨日代表團向報界發表一文、陳述五要點内所包括之日本要求、聲明日本在滿洲未有土地野心、並詳述過去若干年日韓人民在滿洲所受之煩惱、此文措詞較爲温和、可視爲日本現欲和平解决之一證、此間輿情漸抱樂觀、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　據國聯中人聲稱、各理事對於滿案漸覺不耐、欲求於本星期内獲一解决辦法、然亦承認此爲事勢所不可能、因此躁急稍減之代表、刻正討論將理事會暫行休會三星期後、再在巴黎重開、但日代表方面迄於今午十二時半猶稱、關於白里安疏疏日本要求一節、尙未接到東京覆電、白里安認此項疏解、在樹立中日未來關係之基礎上必不可少、而日本則堅持必先樹立未來關係之基礎、然後撤兵、現國聯中人對於十九夜間日本增兵三千人開往滿洲消息、極爲憂慮、加以今日日代表芳澤又向報紙發正式聲明書、申說日本反對立時撤兵之立塲、聲稱、目下時局重心在於滿洲境内鐵道之建築</p>

<p>、日本曾建築兼與中國約定投資興築滿洲境内各鐵路線、中國違成約、對於日本鐵道衞隊與兵士時　暴行、最後復有本村事件及戕害韓僑兩案、在此環境與空氣中日軍勢不能立即徹退云云、因此（日内瓦）之悲觀今日益見深刻、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　本日午後芳澤往晤國聯會秘書長德魯蒙、重行聲明日本之主張、今夜芳澤尙未接到訓令、磋商毫無進展、日内瓦方面頗爲不耐、日本條件若何、仍諱莫如深、人皆以爲奇　、今晨歐洲各報登載日本條件若干條、而駐在東京各訪員又報告若干條、均經認爲不確、日本代表團表示條約須予尊重、所有條約均當尊重、此層必須取獲明而且確諾言、至於二十一條要求、其中日爲日本所抛棄者不必再提、其餘各項業由中國承認、而由華府會議登記、芳澤認爲無復討論餘地、又國民黨對於各項條約、或認爲由於武力脅迫而簽訂、或視爲按照通常手續所訂定、芳澤於此不願加以區别、中國代表團謂日本立意拖延、斥爲疲勞行政院、并剌激中國輿論之手叚、此外并謂日本確在滿洲陰謀樹立地方獨立政府、國聯會對於此種新事實將如何處置之、又如南京因驅除所謂獨立派將用兵於滿洲、而日本因此重行干涉、則日内瓦又將如何對付、白里安詢問南京是否承認舉行關於撤兵方法之磋商、施博士之意、深恐東京乘機排斥張　良、而使國民政府在内政上感受困難、綜觀本日情形、一方日本立意迴避、一方面美國較形退縮、其關係尤爲重要、日本人以爲華盛頓不作任何裁判之想、行政院亦同此見地、此際緊張情形、雖已爲之减少、而談判之事反覺困難、白里安希望笔政院散會時、能全體一致通過一種以妥協爲目標之動議案、而日本擬設法在動議中加入條欵、俾其在滿洲及中國所處地位爲之改善、日本默不發言、或係改變方針之朕兆、亦未可知、設或不然則中日爭論、目前恐無解决可能、（二十日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>學生軍應有之認識</h3>
<p>由於九月十八日日禍爆發以來。嚴重情勢之壓迫。我全國中等以上學校。都臨時增加軍事訓練之敎程。武裝學生以爲自衞自救之準備此種準備。實至必要實爲維護我民族生存自由之切實良圖。</p>
<p>國家年費百分之八十以上之國帑以養軍。而於此外侮之來。仍無以抗禦。不得不準備犧牲我青年學生一部分之學業與時間以從事軍事敎程。作捍禦强暴之舉。此種現象。實至痛心。故學生青年於接受軍事訓練準備武裝之先。應切實認清軍事訓練之意義。及本身應努力之點。</p>
<p>軍事訓練之意義何。在一言以蔽之。即爲總動員的爭取我國家民族之生存權。爭取我國家民族之自由平等。日帝國主義者爲我當前之大敵。其實施暴力壓迫。已置我國家於生死綫上。存亡之機間不容髮我全體國民。自應全體動員。急起作自衞之準備。我學生青年。尤應一致奮起作動員國民全體之先聲。此種軍事訓練其意義有異於以侵略他國爲目的之軍國主義敎育。其相異之點即我爲自衞。我爲維護我民族之生存權。除此而外。絶無侵犯他國之野心。。能自衞而後能和平。能自衞而後能立國。而後能維護民族之生存權。在今日强暴横行公理淹没之世界。我全體國民。應有此認識。我學生青年。尤應有此認識。認識此點。即所以認識今日學校施行軍事訓練武裝學生之重大意義</p>
<p>誠然。我國當前之大敵爲日本武裝學生之當前目標。亦即抗禦日本。但吾人須認定在日本。固亦儘有同情我國反對彼政府暴行之國民。其主張侵略我國者。則爲少數之野心軍閥與政客。侵我者爲我敵。而同情我者則爲我友。故吾人今日之所認爲必須打倒者。爲日本帝國主義。換言之。即日本之野心軍閥與政客。而非整個之日本人。</p>
<p>次之。全國學生青年。今旣已實際武裝矣。但吾人認爲形式上之。武裝次之而精神上之武裝。則尤爲重要蓋武裝身體。必先武裝精神。不能振作精神。堅决意志。澈底剷除從前因循懈惰之積習。則雖有形式上之武器。將安所用。且又奚益。。故今日之武裝學生青年。應注意武裝精神。應切實認取過去事實上之敎訓</p>
<p>學生軍在今日。已爲我國家民族生存之所託其責任至爲重大。而且此種武裝。乃爲眞正之民衆武裝。乃爲眞足以維護民族之武力。故今日之學生軍。應切實認清其責任。應持之以恒。應重視所事。應整齊步驟。應求其實際。勿使此次之軍事訓練流爲軍事八股。使此種重要工作流産。坐失爭取民族生存自由之最後時機。</p>

<p>要聞</p>
<h3>滿洲事件國聯草草結束</h3>
<p>行政院常會於三十日閉幕</p>
<p>我代表所提要求未獲解决</p>
<p>日内瓦特訊關於滿洲事件、自我國代表交國際聯盟行政院解决以來、爲時已近兩週、我國方面、迄未有絲毫之進步、我國代表施肇基所提之數項要求、皆未有滿乵之答復、如（一）請日本從速撤兵、及回復戰前狀態、（二）請日本賠償因其侵略所受之損失、（三）請國聯組織調查委員會、藉以觀察此次事件之眞相、（四）主張由行政院負責解决此事、反對日本主張之直接交涉、關於（二）（三）（四）三項、因日本代表堅持反對、我方亦未有劇烈之辯駁、致上述三項、至今毫無結果、行政院亦置若罔聞、關於從速撤兵一層、行政院主席曾勸令中日兩國軍隊各自退回本國防地、此項辦法、不但滑稽、抑且不合乎邏輯、蓋此次係日本單獨攻我、中國軍隊處於被擊地位、固未嘗離中國土地一步、今行政院令中國軍隊亦與日本軍隊同時撤退、試問華軍應撤至何處、此於事理上已不可通、而况日軍至今不但未曾撤去、且日有增加、日本代表謂日軍已撤去一部分云云、直是掩飾之詞、行政院雖明知爲日方代表之謊言、但懾於日晒之氣焰、只得故作痴聾、此種掩耳盜鈴之辦法、完全與國聯維持和平之本旨相反、無怪此次該院所爲、大爲世界公正人士所極力抨擊也、</p>
<p>九月三十日午後、國聯行政院舉行結束會議、首由主席將五頭會議之結果、向會衆宣讀一遍所謂五頭會議者、爲英法意、德西五國代表之預備會議、行政院之大計、胥於此决定、其性質等於巴黎和會時代之三頭會議、故行政院開會、僅爲表面之形式而已、茲將此五頭會議之結果、照譯如下、</p>
<p>一行政院已悉中日兩國政府對於本院主席所爲之緊急勸告、已有答復前來、並悉該兩國政府依照此項勸告、已爲種種措施、</p>
<p>二本院對於日本政府聲明無侵佔滿洲地方之目的一層、認爲非常重要、（按日本併吞滿洲蓄意已久）</p>
<p>三本院已　日本政府所爲之聲明、謂該國政府當　可能範圍内迅速撤退其已經開始　回之軍隊至其　路界</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<h3>接要聞</h3>
<p>限内、但對於日本人民生命財産之安全、須有確切之保障、又日本政府並希望此項願望、得早日實現、</p>
<p>四本院得悉中國代表之聲明、謂該國政府當於日軍陸續撤去、及中國警察與地方當局恢復之後、對於住在鐵路界限以外日本人民生命財産之安全、將負完全責任、（按我國當局對於保護日僑從未諉卸責任）</p>
<p>五本院已悉中日代表已保證該兩國政府各爲必要之措施、以使此次事件不致擴大、故本院深信兩國政府有維持兩國和平及邦交之願望、</p>
<p>六本院請求雙方從速恢復往日邦交、並望該兩國政府應即履行上述已經承諾之義務、</p>
<p>七本院請雙方關於今後此事之進展、對於本院應時爲完備之報告、</p>
<p>八本院决定於本年十月十四日（星期三）再召集特别會議一次、以便討論當時關於此事之形勢、但如有意外緊急之事發生本院可提早召集、</p>
<p>九本院主席關於此次事件之進展、</p>
<p>于咨詢各委員丨中日兩國代表或其他後、如認爲十月十四日無須召集會議委員時、主席得取消此項召集會議之决定、</p>
<p>行政院主席宣讀後、日本代表即發言表示贊成、我國代表則聲明保留我國賠償損失之要求、並謂希望日本軍隊應於十月十四日前完全撤去、否則中國將取必要之處置云云、最後主席謂會塲如無其他意見、即作爲一致通過、言畢散會、綜觀此次結果、日本全獲勝利、我國所得於國際聯盟者、僅一張白紙黑字而已、閱者見之、不知作何種感想也、</p>
<p>此次吾國外交失敗、國聯行政院有左袒日本之嫌疑、自爲不可否認之事實、而我國外交人員折衝之軟弱亦無可諱飾、此次吾國請求行政院解决滿洲事件、係根據國聯會章第十一條之規定、按此條規定兩國交戰時任何會員國有喚起國聯注意之權、所謂任何會員國者、蓋指交戰以外之第三國而言、其目的在維持和平、並未涉及賠償或組織調查委員會等事、茲爲閱者便利起見、特將第十一條原文照譯如下、（一）···一切戰爭或將起之戰爭、不論其直接影響本會會員國與否、要皆與國聯全體有關、國聯應即採用妥當方法以保障國際之和平、在此情形之下、秘書長徇任何會員國之請、應立即召集行政院、（二）···遇有影響國際關係之情形、及足以擾亂世界和平、或有害和平所係之善良邦交時、任何會員國以友好之名義、有喚起國聯大會或行政院注意之權、」吾人閱後便知此條之設、係對紛爭以外之第三國家而言、今我國顯係當事國、並非策三國家、所要求於行政院者、乃在制裁日本之軍事侵略、及要求賠償因侵略所受之損失、今我國根據十一條而請求行政院、眞可謂文不對題、蓋依十一條之規定、行政院之責任、僅在維持國際之和平爲止、並無解决「懲兇」及「賠償」之權、我國費兩週之力、而未得絲毫之結果、蓋有由也、</p>
<p>此次日本所爲顯係違反國聯會章第十二·十三·及十五條之規定、此三條載明會員國如發生爭執、應即用和平方法解决、萬不可訴諸戰爭、有犯之者應受同章程第十六條之處罰、十六條之原文、譯述如下、「（一）如一會員國不依第十二·十三·及十五條之規定、逕行訴諸戰爭者、本會即認爲此國係對於全體會員國宣戰之行爲、所有會員國、應立即與該國斷絶一切之商務的及經濟的關係、並當禁止其人民與違反會章國家之人民之一切商務的財政的或私人的關係、（二）在此情形之下、行政院有通知各關係國政府之責任、俾各會員國得出其應派之海陸空軍、以使彼頑强國家遵守國際聯盟之義務、（三）···各會員國對於違反會章國家之侵略的行爲、應協同抗拒···（四）任何會員、因違反國聯會員國應有之義務時、即當爲國聯除名···」日本以中國不能保護其僑民、及華軍拆毁南滿鐵路爲藉口、逕行出兵滿洲、顯係違反國聯會章之行爲、故即當適用第十六條以懲戒之、如我國須請求賠償損失或組織調查委員會、則應適用第十五條之規定、然吾國代表計不出此、而根據第十一條請國聯行政院解决、其用意何在、吾人殊不能測其高深也、（十月一日）</p>

<h3>日方發表撤兵問題之中日照會</h3>
<p>國民政府曾有照會致日本外務省、請根抿國際聯盟之决議、於十月十四日以前、撤退佔領地之日本軍隊、由中國接收、並負責恢復各地之治安、日本覆照不允、國府嗣又致一照會、賡續前議、日方則置之不答、上述照會、關係頗爲重大、當蔣公使致第一照會時、因有撤兵期限、各國新聞界一時視爲含有哀的美敦書之性質、輾轉轟傳相與𥈭眙、惟原文迄未見外交部公布、現據大阪朝日新聞載、上項照會業經日外務省發表、亟爲譯誌如次、</p>
<p>蔣公使致幣原照會　本月四日接敝國外交部電稱、日本政府代表曾在國際聯盟正式聲明、現佔各地之日本軍隊自應從速撤退、而恢復九月十八日紧前之狀態、行政院最終决議、亦謂在本月十四日再開會議以前、日本軍隊應悉行撤退、國民政府已於本月二日電令張副司令、選任統率各地軍隊之長官、以便於日軍撤退後接收各地、並負責恢復各地之治安、現該副司令已選定張作相王樹常前往接收、祈即通知日本政府轉令日軍、與我方所派接收長官接洽、於本月十四日以前辦理完竣等因、相應照會貴大臣、十月五日、</p>

<p>暴日肆虐·舉國憤慨。一般學校多訓練義勇軍以備萬一。射擊實習至爲重要。余家本置有大號風槍兩桿。時爲練習邇來兩兒在校均編入義勇軍。在家每日晨興。於天井内以白紙繪紅日在中心。爲射擊之的蓋寓彈彈向太陽旗射發之意。各地義勇軍練習打靶時。最好亦繪紅日爲的。用示射擊之意旨所在。</p>

<h3>讀列寜傳</h3>
<p>孚勒普丨密勒ReneFulopMiller著的列寜與甘地裏關於列寜的敎育政策有下面一段話：</p>
<p>「····他所定的敎育’意在使人不能超過當日政府所許的知識和敎育這樣一來無産階級國裏的百姓們便不會受太多的智識所激動的反省的危險。列寜一方面攻打不識字，一方面却壓制自由科學····」列寜對於民衆求知的自由是不肯放心。天下惟有空氣與智識是不可受人限制。我讀了這段話，不能没有抗議。當時隨手寫了幾句不平鳴，現在給他發表出來吧：</p>
<p>「民愚不可用，大聲發其聾；將明懼難制，忽欲閉其聰。好比鄉下親家婆，又要送禮又眼紅。」</p>
<h3>光餅是兵士的補助品</h3>
<p>— 養</p>
<p>市上所售的光餅。差不多的人都曾吃過但是這餅何以用「光」字做名。想大家知道的很少。際此抗日熱狂之日。尤當把它研究一下。定會振起你們精神。原來光餅是明朝參將戚繼光做的。戚參將名光。所以這餅就呌做光餅。戚繼光是中國古今征倭的偉人。當日我國沿海各地受倭寇之毒。其慘狀並不亞於這次的東三省。那時官軍也是不敢抗。幸而生出這位可敬可愛的戚繼光。代我國爭不少光榮。立不少戰功。自他出兵之後。打得倭寇落花流水。望風而走。他腦根中絶對没有什麽「不抵抗」三個字。他對倭寇和殺猪那樣殺。怨他行軍又嚴勵又勇敢。當時倭人說起戚參將三個字。怕得連小孩都不敢哭。他只慮軍士久戰飢餓。减少殺敵的力量。他特想出這行帶方便的光餅。每個兵卒可以隨身帶着。吃時又省事。兵卒戰到高興時。儘可口裏吃。手裏殺。連吃帶殺。殺他個光盡。有一次大隊倭宼竟殺到離福州省城四十里的北嶺。勢極危急。戚公統帥軍隊去抵抗。命他兒子做先鋒。下令軍士不准回頭。違令者斬。軍隊出了東門。他的兒子回頭望他父親出了城門没有。被戚公看見。馬上下令斬首。所以他的軍士勇敢直前。一以當十。及打了勝仗。回到殺子所在。想起兒子。就地建一亭。呌做思兒亭。至今尙存。大家想一想這位戚公愧不愧做一個中華軍人·大家吃着光餅就當念着戚公又當學他的忠勇。快快把東三省奪回來。做今日的戚公。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>坎那大的戰事紀念碑。坎那大Canada新近建造一座國家的戰事紀念碑。大約在今年的年終可以告成。所費約五萬金鎊。高六十英尺。寛五十英尺。所有一切工作概由一個英國家庭擔任。這家庭。可稱是藝術的家庭因爲他家六兄弟和一妹。都能從事於此。計自一千九百二十六年工作至今。也足見工程的浩大了。</p>
<p>西班牙的戀愛工作西班牙有一個省分。名呌白西龍那。Barcelona可說是自由之邦一個不自由的地方。因爲女子們倘和男子談戀愛。不能單獨行動。祗可當着女師保的面前。略談情話倘要作親熱甜蜜的表示。竟不可能就是接吻一回事。也須等訂婚以後方可實行。一般青年。都以爲是莫大的苦事。</p>
<p>政治家與偵探小說偵探小說鈎心鬥角。富有興趣。足以開發心思。所以全世界愛讀的人很多。英國現代大政治家曾任首相的勞合喬治氏LioydGeorge與包爾温氏SBaldwin都是偵探小說的愛讀者。公餘之暇。每以偵探小說爲消遣。</p>
<h3>二十四小時感言</h3>
<p>— 楊吉孚</p>
<p>去年早春薄遊東北。耳目所及。在在痛心入關過津參觀南開大學。晤張伯苓先生。（時先生方自日本參加遠東運動會我國出席代表失敗後歸國）先生問曰。君自遼東來。有何感想。予曰。感想誠有之。惟覺無從說起。此行所見。則東北經濟完全已入日人掌握之中。日人固無須再加以政治武力之侵略。譬諸屋中陳設之器物。以及箱篋中所藏金銀財貨。已盡爲其所有。曷貴乎灑掃之事。東北政事正如此。日人苟欲併此而奪去之。無異自尋煩惱。然而東北滅亡。僅僅二十四小時可耳。先生憤然曰。豈特東北如此。二十四小時直可亡中國耳。君拭目以視全國海口。有無警備乎。今者日本果於二十四小時内占領東北。吁。我言何不幸而中。但願先生之言得幸而不中耳。（移酬助賑）</p>
<h3>讖音</h3>
<p>— 紅冰子</p>
<p>讖之言。君子不尙然亡泰者胡。興漢者秀。當塗高應曹魏之昌。清快丸卜滿清之覆。童謠俚諺。無意中於事後有騐。莊子所謂道在尿屎者非耶。茲摘四則錄左。</p>
<p>東洋車馬路上人所共見共乘也。今則妄動干戈。無端尋釁。乘我天災。加兵國境。一味野蠻。毫無公理。不是東洋錯。（諧聲）難道是中國錯嗎。</p>
<p>千做萬做蝕本不做此商界中之通行語也。對蠻無理智之倭奴。抵抗仇貨。經濟絶交。國民國存之無上上策。不與日本（諧聲）做往來。我商人早已預言之矣。</p>
<p>有天。無日頭此亦俚語。按遼瀋舊名奉天版圖要再有奉天故土。一定要使日本人不會出頭。。才可以金甌完好</p>
<h3>劉海粟氏述歐游考察藝術的感想（中）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>氣韵生動。這是很難解釋而尤重要的一條。這四個字可以拆開來從「氣」「韵」「生」「動」一個一個地解釋。可以一刀斬成二截從「氣韵」「生勳」來分别解釋。也可以把「氣韵生動」作爲一個名詞來解釋。</p>
<p>氣韵生動。近來在中國畫壇上。是已成了整個的名詞從不分開來講的至多說。含有氣韵的生動。或瀰漫着氣韵的生動。實際上宇宙間的生動無處不瀰漫着氣韵。氣韵是必然托着生動而表現的。要是像上面所說五法那樣用一外國語來替代。我們便可用節奏Rhgthm一語已很適用。英國批評家裴德Peter在他的名著「文藝復興論」中說。「一切藝術。都傾向音樂的狀態。」所以節奏。不但是音樂的狀態。是互在全部藝術中的一種狀態。明白了這一點對於氣韵生動的意義。必能易以理解。上面我曾提及氣韵生動。一方面是中國畫創作之最後完成。他方面是批評的最高的準則。在從前的謝赫也正是這個意思。第一方面。創作之所以能達到氣韵生動因爲它有首要的條件「筆致」上面所論已甚明顯實顯也可以達到氣韵生動例如「别體之妙亦爲入神」。但寫入不遺筆致爲上乘上面亦曾論及至於結構與模寫也靠筆致來顯出它們的特長那末筆法在中國畫上是很重要而神秘的了是的從前謝赫也以筆致爲先天的。地說「天挺生知非學所及。」至少「意思横逸。動筆新奇。」意思横溢我們可視爲靈感的降臨。畫家創作不是像一座機械那樣天天在走動的。他有了靈感的奮啟。才現於筆墨最少在他稱心悅意或竟悲愁中得悅樂的時候才能下筆。他紀顧駿之的創作情形說。「嘗結構層樓。以爲畫所。風雨奥炎之時故不操筆。天和氣爽之日。方染毫登樓去梯。妻子罕見。」顧駿之如此。必也還有人一反其意適在風雨奥炎之時動筆。所以創作之達到氣韵生動。實是天才的成分爲多。</p>
<p>日久無好鮮戲此諺。喻下流人之不可久交也。利用朝鮮亡國奴。慘殺僑胞之話把戲。不是好鮮戲也。好鮮戲。括括呌。可憐鮮人不過做扯線木人頭戲。眞正的一幕日久無好鮮戲。我知世界舞臺上。决不能博得呌好之聲也。</p>
<p>來函瘦鵑先生道席曩於寗波同鄉會。虞唐二女士發起各省水災畫展中。見有陳小蝶先生所作天平秋色一幅。署名蝶野。設色造境之佳妙。使人每日多想不忘。惜當日購畫係按劵對號。不能任意選擇。明珠落於誰手。不得而知。鄙人酷此畫。擬出重價購求。不知先生能否將此信一爲披露。得者倘願割愛。務乞投函自由談托瘦鵑先生轉交。不勝感感。即頌著安。退盦上言。瘦鵑按。吾友小蝶。作畫雋逸。署名蝶野者。尤爲其精心結撰之作。平生自惜羽毛。非特兼金相求。不與一幅。即尋常展覽會中。亦罕見其作品。近爲各省水災。大發宏願。與錢瘦鐵君合作佛像。每幅三十元。額定百幅。悉數移賑。聞定購者已過半矣。惟予亦雅愛蝶野山水。深交十餘年。僅得紫羅蘭盦圖一幅。蝶野旣發宏頋。甚望其於　佛之外。更作山水若干幅。作一個人展覽。即以售欵悉數充賑。則功德不愈大乎。凡有贊成吾言者。僕願引首發起。並問退盦以爲如何。</p>

<h3>敲夢的杵（二○）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>陶遲先生是主張武裝和平的。聽了這歌聲，便不堅持平日的主張了。他斜倚在一棵樹上，點着頭兒，拍着脚尖兒，在欣賞在喃喃自語··</p>
<p>「不錯啊，在這公理大明的時代，中國那有覆亡的日子；人生在世，是爲着求得快樂而生的，不是爲着自尋煩惱而生的，我眞不免多憂多慮了「陶同志，這裏來丨」一個歌女遠遠招呼着。</p>
<p>「這裏來丨來來來丨」許多歌女隨聲附和的招呼着。</p>
<p>「來了丨來了丨」陶遲情不自禁的迎上前去。</p>
<p>「請問女士姓名？」</p>
<p>「我們在現代的樂園中唱歌，都呌做現代歌女。」</p>
<p>「請問女士多少青春？」</p>
<p>「我的年紀是二八青春，他的年紀也是二八青春，其他其他的年紀都是二八青春；而且，今年是二八青春，到了來年也是二八青春，到了來年以後的來年，總是二八青春。」</p>
<p>陶遲聽了這些話，以似了解，又似不了解，他離却了歌女，只管向前行去恍恍惚惚走進了一家餐館，裏面有許多青年男女正舉行着現代的聚餐會便請陶遲加入，只爲聚餐會中空着一個座位。</p>
<p>「請問諸君，今天爲有何事而舉行這聚餐會？」</p>
<p>「陶先生，這今天二字，我們是不適用；有了今天，便有過去的昨天又有未來的明天；我們這裏都没有，只有悠久不變的現在。」</p>
<p>「難道這裏是長畫不夜的麽？」</p>
<p>「我們只永遠的生活在晨光普照之下，無所謂盡，也無所開夜··有了晝夜」</p>
<p>便不能保持我們的現在，我們是打倒晝夜的。」</p>

<p>市塲概况　本月份之銀根緊勢、原屬暗中浮動未便儘量揭　個中内幕、恐於金融界前途受其影響也、在過去中之、半月觀之乍漲乍落、尙能强持忍耐、詎下半月頓又發生特殊難挽之危局、銀根步步緊張、形勢日趨險惡、昨日銀行劃頭之加水、居然高至五錢、開今年未有之新紀錄、長此緊急、誠非金融界之幸事、要亦爲全滬商市之隱憂也、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　「洋厘」晨間洋厘市象較前日似覺上挺、收盤價爲七錢二分八厘、午市略小二毫半、爲七錢二分七厘七毫半、結果較前日午市改昻半厘、形勢尙無惡劣印象、「銀拆」愈趨危殆景境、早市銀拆開出三錢五分、尙屬相宜、蓋與前午相埓、人心雖緊、未免有恐怖景象、詎午市又昻七、分而爲四錢二分、劃頭加水尤爲奇昻、竟至四錢九分及五錢之高盤、一般缺銀方面、束手無策、形勢之纂嚴殆難形容也、銀行掛牌亦因銀拆之抬高乃隨之增至一錢四分、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋早市爲六錢五分八厘、午市爲六錢五分七厘、結果較前日改小一厘七毫半、做出交易早市三千角午市二千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢五分五厘半、午市爲六錢五分五厘一毫二忽半、較前日午市跌小一厘光景、做出交易早市十三萬五千角、午市五萬角、銅元仍爲三百七十七千五百文、交易三萬二千餘、串</p>
<p>銀洋進出　「銀欵」昨日銀行收解消息、以銀根過緊、商業蕭條、故對於進出手續、亦較平時爲簡、華商收解票欵一百七八十萬外商收解票欵一百二十餘萬、各種貨匯稅雜諸欵收解六百八九十萬、其他特欵及押欵交易略有見聞、因數額有限、從略、進倉九十萬、錢莊銀公單收解五千二百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百三十餘萬、各路匯欵收解五十餘萬、解現一百餘、萬「洋欵」匯劃票欵早市做出九十七萬五千、午市做出一百七十四萬五千、鈔票早市十一萬、午市三萬、塲外鈔票早市十四萬五千、午市六萬、銀行買賣早市互市五十萬、午市互市六十五萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百十餘萬、鈔票進出二百餘萬錢莊洋公單收解五百十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百八十餘萬、拆措洋欵進出一百七十餘萬小錢莊交易及匯頭現洋等僅三四十萬、客路來源三十餘萬、</p>
<h3>證劵債券市價較前稍漲</h3>
<p>趨勢甚平和前後市上落殊微</p>
<p>市况尙佳後交九百七十餘萬</p>
<p>昨證券交易所各債券市况、現貨雖續有多種開出、惟成交稀少、全日共僅九千元、期市十月期平平如前、而以套利交易頗旺、十一月期益見活潑、計上午成交六百三十餘萬、後市三百三十五萬、合計約九百七十萬元、内統稅最旺佔二百五十餘萬、二○關約二百萬元、外交局勢雖未見有新發展、國内和平統一問題、甚可樂觀、債市環象大致頗佳特銀錢業方面咸抱緊縮、大户未有鉅額投資、買方人氣鮮有起色、市上仍以零户及套利進出爲多、以故各債券市價雖較前日大致上漲、而勢極穩和、且舊空户現均不肯補進了結、准備月底交貨、多頭方面之無力收貨者、實有受軋之虞、因是買方雖略佔優勢、統觀求供情况、殊見平衡、前後市始終陷於盤旋狀態、其呆滯情形、爲數星期來所未見、結果較前日如二○關稅下月期貨均漲逾一元、其他多好起數角、惟編遣整六續微跌、二○關統稅現貨比週初仍跌頗巨</p>

<p>美棉已有轉趨平疲之勢、但金價稍堅、且有二大户購進包額殊巨、約有二萬多擔、於是檯面被搜殆盡、市氣較緊、然市上現棉生意依然絶跡、毫無問津、以價格太高、外棉仍廉、遠期廠商仍抛出、前途仍依美棉爲進退、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市形勢稍堅</h3>
<p>南頭　昨日米情、西路來源不多、本城交易比前爲旺、且聞閘北提增、各店號乘此檔口添買存貨、新粳破礱檔二種喊起一二角、百哥窰種到仍零星、寗胃有點本街去路揀項頗聯、價昻一角、新陳蘆洋尖交易不暢市仍平定、適變陰元上落有限、茭白尖已經落零、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日到貨二三十號、因前數天猛跌後、運商虧本、内地初隨滬市市情下瀉、因客方問訊轉硬、早晨做開極好、常錫新陳之貨最出風頭、價昻角許、南南帮　中紅稻白稻等貨到銷二敵、市無升沉糯米市銷微緊、埠杜尖受洋米影響、趨低之勢、崑山新粳到旺銷呆形疲二三角、</p>
<h3>洋米交易清淡</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、北帮不動、本街觀望、統市交易清淡、市面漸漸回復沉寂狀態期洋米洋行雖有抛售、但無進户顧問、且月前抛定之十月份九月底各貨、均已絡續抵埠、因此人心均爲看小、客帮雖有胃口、亦多觀望不動、以待價落再辦統市祇有本街應酬次小絞一百包、價十元○四角云、」</p>
<h3>標粉大致平定</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各有份市貨、大致呈平定之象、因洋麥互有出入、故各月份開份、穩定之中、微帶俏勢、迨至下午開盤、近期因銀根關係　尙居定勢、遠期則漲勢頗銳、謠傳所定之洋麥、在美國口岸失事、又傳歐洲如法國等亦向美方訂購三四千萬蒲式耳、預測洋麥之報價、恐須騰貴因此人心激昻、步步峰俏、觀後步或者尙有好面也、結果本月份漲七厘半、十一月至一月份漲二分半、二月份漲二分二厘半、三月份漲二分七晨半云、</p>
<h3>期麥後市猛跳</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、形勢雖穩、漲度無幾、較前日祗有二分之差度、迨至下午開盤、近遠月份、俱見猛漲、交易亦異常暢盛、因傳所定之美麥失事、又傳法國之訂購大批美麥、就此類推或者洋麥之來源無形中當須關住、致蟄伏之人心、驟然激昻、與前日高低之差度達一錢二錢之巨、恐後步此說一確、尙有一度之熱奮也結果本月份較前日漲八分、十一月份漲一錢、十二月份漲九分、一月至三月各漲一錢二分云、</p>
<h3>絲茶廠經歐銷仍無轉機</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無起色、查滬白廠經里昻去電不轉、法銷仍趨停滯、美莊雖有現期貨談判、而認盤仍苛各廠商　以本重價小、虧折大巨、仍難就範、昨祇和興進中上身滬白廠經十包、緯成進鄂繭滬　黄廠經十包、高倍等進粗黄絲十五包、價仍平疲云、</p>
<h3>輯里經續有運滬</h3>
<p>昨由潯震兩埠運到二百餘件</p>
<p>邇來輯里經歐美銷路不暢、而産地新絲存底激增、紛紛出運、昨日潯震兩埠續有輯里經運滬、計由梅恒裕等裝到繡麟慶馬牌等二百二十件、現均上棧待售、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶略有動機</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、交易依然寥落、針眉貢熙珠茶等項、錦隆杜德等行、雖略有進胃、然均係補充缺額性質、並無大宗需求、至疲滯已久之珍眉綠茶、英莊怡和洋行、業已發出大批定價電報、市勢已略有動機惟所議市盤、較前見低二十餘兩、局勢沬能認爲樂觀云、</p>
<h3>針秀眉英銷略動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊之針眉秀眉等綠茶、英莊源生福時等洋行、均起動辦、市面略形見活、惟因去路滯銷已久、市盤見低五六兩、（熙綠茶、白頭莊啟昌瑞昌裕隆等行買進四百貢十餘箱、市價較前數日無上落、惟珍眉一、項僅土莊貨、略有交易、高莊依然滯銷云、</p>
<h3>疋頭袖裏花洋布暢銷</h3>
<p>最近來呢絨市面、堪稱、平穩祇惜先令轉大、預測明春市價、必當紊亂不堪、昨馬鬃袖裏及花洋布極爲暢銷、洋行出貨頗形擁擠、本客帮諸買方需要甚殷、尤以洋服舖淮胃最强、德記公平共結</p>
<p>洋布一律售元五錢、天豐永樂四錢九分、冲馬鬃袖　各牌齊售四錢八分半以至五錢、眞貨市存見缺、較之上週每碼激漲數分銀子、昨泰和貨躉批每碼售元一兩一錢半、、門莊零星開剪計洋一元七角五分</p>
<h3>藏青麥爾登銷暢回漲</h3>
<p>麥爾登呢、日來正在旺銷之時、本客帮續有購進、大半俱爲洋服套頭號衣所需料、前曾一度下跌、蓋市存充斥、走銷不旺所致、昨則復見回漲、藏青色格外俏　、　　每碼激漲數分、查麥爾登祇有元藏二色、元色　於川帮、藏青銷於本街及浙内地小客帮、川帮一月前早已辦妥、本特上目下在蠕蠕動辦云云、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>新鉛絲昨銷出六七百擔</p>
<p>五金交易、北路仍因戰事關係、去路大遜、南方則因銀根緊迫成交不多、是以全市趨勢頗覺清靜、惟久處岑寂之新鉛絲、昨日銷去共有六七百擔之鉅、其價十六號至二十號每擔估十三兩二錢半、二十一號至二十五號十八兩七錢半、粗花色則開九兩至十一兩不等云、</p>
<h3>煤炭</h3>
<p>紅崎煤存貨充足</p>
<p>紅崎白煤、近來到貨頗旺、存煤充足、調查各棧現貨、約有七千餘噸之多、其走銷因天時關係、尙不十分踴躍、善價凈篩塊每噸念二兩、而下身篩出之灰小子、銷路極大、蓋播砂作洗衣作及各小工廠等、需用增加故價格亦極堅挺、每噸現售十七兩五錢云、</p>

<h3>太平洋會開幕</h3>
<p>到九國代表百卅一人</p>
<p>討論太平洋商業關係</p>

<h3>各組之華委員</h3>

<h3>討論關稅銀價</h3>
<p>討論太平洋商業關係之四圓桌會議、大抵集中於關稅及銀價兩問題、惟於其他有關係之事件、亦嘗略爲提及、（一）對於關稅問題僉認宣布一關稅休息或關稅穩定時期爲合宜之事、然欲望其實現、自不免有許多困難、傾銷問題、尤爲一困難之點、今各國對於他國之傾銷、雖皆認爲不願然此傾銷兩字尙無公認之定義、關於傾銷之程度、亦無準確之報告、故向研究委員所提建議之一、即爲從事研究此點衆又公認增高關稅運動、足使銷費者增重其担負、而妨碍國際貿易之發展、惟經濟的國家主義、常傾向於增加關稅之一方面日本雖取保護關稅政策、然聞其國内意見、頗爲不一、對於此項政策之適宜與否、發生疑問者已漸增、例如日本以保護關稅政策發展其國家之化學工業、然亦有主張一任德國生産各種化學品、而日本則從事於生産他種物品、可售諸德國以資交換者、顧在中國則反是、一般於理論上信仰自由貿易之經濟學家、頗有主張中國目下應取保護關稅政策者、其所持理由第一因中國方處於保護關稅主義之世界第二因中國工業多在幼稚時期、故暫時施行保議關稅爲正當之辦法、、（二）關於價問題所得之普通結論、以爲銀價之低、落非中國商業不振之原因、而商業之不振實爲銀價跌落之由來至於銀價上漲、、於中國商業上是損是益意見頗不一致</p>
<p>各圓桌會議、曾向秩序及研究委員會提出若干切實之建議、其一已得全體同意者爲太平洋商業統計改進之重要、並主張由該會研究部調查、尙有其他建議、爲研究消除各國國内及國際間經濟障碍之發展情形、並抽象的研究廢除太平洋關稅之結果、是否合宜、在進行此項問題者、若能於假定的自由貿易、在各種工業上將發生何種實際的影響、先作此種研究、則必能有更明智之舉動又因對於此等事件、與國家政策之專家意見、相去頗遠、故主張研究可否利用敎育機關、以訓練朝野意見、而减少其隔膜云、</p>
<h3>徐新六歡迎詞</h3>

<p>諸位來賓這次開第四次太平洋國際學會、雖然在形式上稍有些改變在過去的數星期中、很有許多嚴重的疑惑、能否舉行這次大會的華代表、爲大會的東道、驟遭了一個重大的國難他的嚴重、在歷史上没有見過、益以此次大會在中華開會、雖然中日問没有正工公開的戰爭、但這二主要國家、在太平洋兩岸、確已在戰爭的狀態中全中國的民族、都被一種烈强的恥辱和怨恨的反感燃着了、中國代表在初起感情振額的時候、不能自主的懷疑起來、以爲和平而有商榷的國際工具像這個太平國際學會有甚麽用處、諸位大概已經知道中國理事會幾次的提議延期開會的可能性同時日本代表團、也欲取消開會、</p>
<p>開會前的幾天、似乎這次太平洋第四次國際學會議、勢將延期了、我們現在向後看一看、一切的懷疑失望情感的暴發已氷釋無餘了、并全能恕諒了、我們總是人類、所以總逃不了種種的脆弱、這種重大的國際形勢、突然加到我們身上、這是要試騐我們對於一種主義的信仰的程度、但我們却没有預備、這危機對於我們信仰薄弱的人們太强烈了、現在我敢說全體華代表都要向各代表深深抱歉因爲在這不幸的時期中這一切的困難狀况、使諸位感到十分不便</p>
<p>但今天我們濟濟一堂、舉行太平洋國際學會第四次大會、在會塲地址方面在儀式方面、和代表數之略爲减少方面看來這次的會議、有些改變、但是我已說過這是一個大會容我借這個機會說幾句話、</p>
<p>這次開會在破碎中得了成功全仗會中的一般會員忍耐的·智慧的·哲學的·和政治才能的·帮忙、特别是這個哲學家的主席這太平洋國際學會的方法及理想、是否祗適用於世界和平各國好感的時候、</p>
<p>今天這次的會議不但是永遠可以紀念着、不但是在太平洋國際學會史上有紀念的一頁、即在國際關係性質上的各機關各組織上是値得紀念的、因爲這已建立榮光的前例、許多人在和平的時候能自誇有國際頭腦而同時無理當道、情感激怒的時候、息心靜氣耐力研究和無偏見的討論、</p>
<p>但諸位我們也不當因此成功而自滿、這國際學會尙在幼稚、我們有許多荆棘的問題、等我們去分晰和解决、若吾人對於這些問題用差誤的態度去觀察、和偏見眼光去對付那末、我們的精神和所用方法必然失敗如果我們對於他人的見解爲情感和偏見所朦蔽了、我們亦必失敗、如果我們走人歧路對於一種特别信條、濡染詭辯者的色彩、或對於一種特别的案件、懷認罪者的精神、、我們亦總必失敗也</p>
<p>我們在此工作的第一天、對於我們問題和工作的性質、當有一種明白的諒解這些問題、是各國和各民族的問題我們的工作、是爲這些國家和民族着想爲了一個民族或爲了許多民族着想這是最神聖的信託、但也是最危險的工作、這工作在華人聖賢的口吻說來「一言興邦、一言喪邦」我們只能袪除偏見去負這神聖的責任、並堅决地不使我們思想和判决被偏見和情感來矇蔽的我們在此、不是來哭也不是來笑、只是來明白一切、我們在此不是來教導、只是來互相交換意見、只要我們有和謙的精神、去求眞理、然後如有小小的成功、可以達到、</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Situation Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>Five-Nation Representatives Held a Meeting Yesterday, U.S. Representative Absent</p>
<p>Administrative Council Tentatively Scheduled to Reopen in Paris in Three Weeks</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Arrives in Heihe to Assume Acting Provincial Government Chairmanship</p>
<p>League of Nations Administrative Council</p>
<h3>Five-Nation Representatives Convene</h3>
<p>Discussions Kept Strictly Confidential</p>
<p>Mediation Efforts Still Showing No Progress</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, representatives from England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain convened in the president's office. The meeting lasted from 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM. After the meeting, the representatives looked concerned. When approached by reporters, they replied that the discussions were strictly confidential. Only one representative stated that the Administrative Council might meet tomorrow, but did not specify whether the meeting would be open to the public. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the Japanese delegation told a Reuters reporter that instructions from Tokyo were expected to arrive today. Simultaneously, the representatives from England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, forming the Administrative Council's committee handling the Manchurian Incident, convened at 11:00 AM in the president's office to study the situation and possible steps to take before receiving replies from China and Japan. Several foreign diplomatic officials and important representatives have not yet arrived in Geneva, which is considered inconvenient. Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux is unable to leave Madrid due to domestic affairs. Italian Foreign Minister Grandi is in Rome preparing to travel to Germany, and German Chancellor and Foreign Minister Brüning is busy with state affairs and unable to leave Berlin. Fortunately, the British and French diplomatic authorities are still in Geneva. Japanese chief representative Yoshizawa took a car ride to the outskirts of Geneva this morning. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Briand, the president of the League of Nations Administrative Council, summarized the League's work on the Manchurian issue, stating that it would take a long time. He added that there might be some progress, but it was very slow. Briand is fully representing the League of Nations Administrative Council, but so far has not found a quick way to fundamentally resolve the Manchurian dispute. The reply from Tokyo has not yet arrived, so there has been no major development in today's discussions. British Foreign Secretary Reading met with Briand, strongly emphasizing the need to conclude negotiations as soon as possible. This morning, a key aide to Briand visited Japanese representative Yoshizawa. In the afternoon, Yoshizawa met with League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond. It is reported that Yoshizawa's conversation with the League of Nations Secretary-General was still related to the procedures of the League of Nations. The Japanese government's reply to Briand's proposal is expected to arrive here tomorrow morning. At that time, the Administrative Council will hold a closed-door meeting. The claim that China requested England and the United States to send troops to Manchuria is completely unheard of by responsible parties here. The Japanese delegation also denies that Yoshizawa ever made such a statement, and the rumors are ridiculous. A dispatch from London also stated that British officials deny having any such information. This claim likely originated in Geneva, but was not reported by Reuters. Today, the Chinese delegation announced telegrams from Zhang Xueliang stating that on October 17th and 18th, Japanese troops shelled the vicinity of Goubangzi, and on the 18th, Japanese planes dropped bombs on Tongliao. The Chinese delegation stated that the five demands from Tokyo have not been received, so they know nothing about them. The Japanese delegation does not want to criticize these demands, only saying that Yoshizawa and Briand are currently negotiating along this outline. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The optimism that Liu expressed in the Council in previous days is no longer visible today. People in the League of Nations also believe that the Manchurian case has worsened. It is now rumored here that U.S. Secretary of State Stimson supports Japan's demand not to specify a withdrawal date for troops. Although this claim has not been officially confirmed, the situation has suddenly become serious. This morning, representatives from the five major powers continued their meeting, with Briand reporting on the progress of mediation efforts to date. U.S. Representative Gilbert was absent, which is seen as significant, suggesting that today's meeting focused on actions based on the League of Nations Charter rather than arbitration based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Before the meeting, Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji sent another document to the Council, reportedly a very important and secret report on the overall Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) During the five-nation representatives' meeting, Briand reported on the progress of negotiations. At the same time, League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond forwarded Dr. Shi's memorandum, stating that China's demands are at a minimum and cannot be conceded further. This matter will be further [discussed].</p>
<h3>Completely National Product - Liver Blood Essence - Manufactured by Shanghai Nanshi Hongqiao Fukang Pharmacy</h3>
<p>Efficacy: Tonifies blood, strengthens the body. The medicinal formula is clearly stated in Chinese within the leaflet.</p>
<p>Comparison: A simple testing method is printed and sent along with the leaflet (testing method can be sent in advance).</p>
<p>The medicine is a type of organic iron compound, just like "iron in food, after being absorbed in the small intestine, combines with essence to be stored in the liver for the purpose of supplementing hemoglobin and red blood cells," an artificial product with the same effect. Extremely effective for tonifying. Can further develop various tissues and promote metabolism. Can make the whole body healthy, increase weight, and improve skin. Effective for all acute and chronic blood deficiencies, neurasthenia, chronic skin diseases, failure to recover after illness, irregular menstruation in women, chlorosis, poor development in children, etc. No different from top-quality foreign products, but much cheaper. Large bottle sold for $1.40, enough for an adult to take for about sixteen or seventeen days. We hope our countrymen will compare it. This medicine is specially compounded and is different from ordinary iron supplements. Therefore, it does not change in the stomach, but is absorbed in the intestines, producing a quick effect without harming the stomach and intestines. However, people with idiosyncrasies and those with hemoptysis or hematemesis should still avoid using it (one should pay attention to the contraindications of all medicines containing iron or the like).</p>
<p>A report from a closed-door meeting of the Executive Yuan, the main points of the situation today are as follows: (1) The Japanese representative submitted a summary to be published in newspapers, the tone of which was mild, with the most important focus on the railway issue. (2) According to contradictory news received privately from Washington, Stimson has not abandoned the idea of adopting sanctions, but also that Stimson supports starting negotiations immediately and opposes a deadline for troop withdrawal. (3) China, based on the League of Nations Covenant, cannot concede on any of its demands. If Briand's proposal to the Executive Yuan, as rumored, requires Nanjing to provide security guarantees that go beyond the original situation, then the situation could become serious. The reason is that Japan's insistence on not yielding in recent days has been viewed unfavorably by people in Geneva. If Japan makes some concessions, the Executive Yuan will necessarily ask China to compromise. If Nanjing refuses, the Executive Yuan may also have complaints. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japan Accepts Briand's Proposal</h3>
<p>Administrative Council May Reopen in Paris</p>
<p>(Geneva) Reuters has learned that Yoshizawa has received instructions from Tokyo to accept Briand's proposal regarding the five points put forward by Japan. Japan originally insisted that China must, in principle, acknowledge these five points before Japanese troops could withdraw into the railway zone. Briand proposed that Japan abandon the demand that China must acknowledge Japan's railway rights as a prerequisite for starting negotiations. It is reported that Briand will try to overcome the difficulties caused by Japan's refusal to set a deadline for troop withdrawal, tentatively suspending the Administrative Council meeting on Friday or Saturday and reopening it in Paris within three weeks. It is expected that the Japanese troops will have completely withdrawn by that time.</p>

<p>(Geneva) Today, people in the League of Nations suddenly received news that the Chinese and Japanese governments were negotiating the Manchurian case. Therefore, Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Shi Zhaoji immediately denied it, solemnly declaring that China will absolutely not enter into any agreement with Japan outside the scope of the League of Nations Council and guaranteed to all council members that if the Chinese government directly receives proposals from Japan, it will transfer all of them to the Council. (Guomin News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Tonight, there is already suspicion here that the League of Nations Council may not hold a closed-door meeting tomorrow because if Japan can accept the principle of troop withdrawal as generally hoped, the Council will adjourn for two or three weeks, and the next meeting may be held in Paris. During the adjournment, Briand will still be entrusted to maintain close contact with the Chinese and Japanese governments to mediate. When a meeting is necessary, Briand will convene a special meeting. Japanese representative Yoshizawa is still awaiting new instructions from Tokyo late tonight, presumably seeking instructions on Briand's proposal for a basis for agreement. It is reported that on Sunday night, the Japanese delegation received instructions from Tokyo not to pack their luggage, which was in preparation for canceling the previous order to leave Geneva, thus indicating that Japan does not intend to withdraw from the international community. Although Briand's contact with the Chinese and Japanese representatives has aroused some optimism, given various reports that Japan is still occupying Manchuria and its troops are still staying and not withdrawing, many observers of the situation say that Japan is still in conflict with the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. If the Council cannot quickly find a solution, it will jeopardize the value of the League of Nations as a peace organization. The main issue at present is no longer between China and Japan, but has shifted to between Japan and the League of Nations. However, Japan still insists on legal objections to U.S. participation, and only temporarily reserved them after receiving Briand's letter, and will still raise them at a suitable time. (Guomin News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the Japanese delegation issued a statement to the press, elaborating on Japan's demands included in the five points, stating that Japan has no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, and detailing the troubles suffered by Japanese and Korean people in Manchuria in recent years. The wording of this document is more moderate and can be seen as evidence of Japan's current desire for a peaceful resolution. Public opinion here is gradually becoming optimistic. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to sources within the League of Nations, the council members are becoming impatient with the Manchurian case and want to find a solution within this week, but also admit that this is impossible. Therefore, representatives who have reduced their impatience are currently discussing temporarily adjourning the Council for three weeks and then reopening it in Paris. However, the Japanese side still stated as of 12:30 this afternoon that they had not received a reply from Tokyo regarding Briand's clarification of Japan's demands. Briand believes this clarification is essential for establishing the foundation of future Sino-Japanese relations, while Japan insists on establishing the foundation of future relations before withdrawing troops. Currently, people in the League of Nations are extremely concerned about the news that Japan increased its troops by 3,000 and sent them to Manchuria on the 19th. In addition, today, Japanese representative Yoshizawa issued a formal statement to the newspapers, reiterating Japan's position against immediate troop withdrawal, stating that the focus of the current situation is on the construction of railways within Manchuria.</p>

<p>Japan has built and agreed with China to invest in the construction of various railway lines in Manchuria. China violated the agreements, and there were frequent atrocities against Japanese railway guards and soldiers. Finally, there were the Benmura Incident and the murder of Korean residents. In this environment and atmosphere, Japanese troops cannot immediately withdraw. Therefore, pessimism in Geneva is becoming more profound today. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, Yoshizawa visited League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond and reiterated Japan's claims. Yoshizawa has not yet received instructions tonight, and there has been no progress in consultations. Geneva is quite impatient, and Japan's conditions remain a mystery, which everyone finds strange. This morning, European newspapers published several Japanese conditions, while correspondents stationed in Tokyo reported several other conditions, all of which have been deemed inaccurate. The Japanese delegation stated that treaties must be respected, all treaties must be respected, and this must be obtained as a clear and definite promise. As for the Twenty-One Demands, those that Japan has abandoned need not be mentioned again. The remaining items have been acknowledged by China and registered by the Washington Conference, which Yoshizawa believes leaves no room for further discussion. Also, regarding the various treaties, whether the Kuomintang considers them to have been signed under duress or regards them as having been concluded according to normal procedures, Yoshizawa does not want to distinguish between them. The Chinese delegation said that Japan intends to delay, denouncing it as a tactic to exhaust the Executive Yuan and provoke Chinese public opinion. In addition, it said that Japan is indeed plotting to establish a local independent government in Manchuria. How will the League of Nations deal with this new fact? Also, if Nanjing uses force in Manchuria to expel the so-called independent factions, and Japan therefore intervenes again, how will Geneva deal with it? Briand asked Nanjing whether it would agree to hold consultations on methods of troop withdrawal. Dr. Shi's intention is deeply fearful that Tokyo will take the opportunity to exclude Zhang Xueliang and cause difficulties for the National Government in internal affairs. Looking at today's situation, on the one hand, Japan intends to evade, and on the other hand, the United States is retreating more. The relationship is particularly important. The Japanese believe that Washington has no intention of making any judgments, and the Administrative Council shares this view. Although the tension has decreased, negotiations are proving to be more difficult. Briand hopes that when the Executive Yuan adjourns, it will unanimously pass a motion aimed at compromise, while Japan intends to find a way to add clauses to the motion to improve its position in Manchuria and China. Japan's silence may be a sign of a change in strategy, or it may not be. If not, the Sino-Japanese dispute may not be resolved at present. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>International Organizations</p>
<h3>Promoting Sino-Japanese Peace</h3>
<p>(London) Today, women's circles are quite active for the sake of peace in Manchuria.

The telegrams were sent to the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, which, upon receiving the telegrams, sought the cooperation of several international women's organizations, all of which are based in Geneva. They have now jointly submitted a letter to the League of Nations Administrative Council and the President of the Council, stating that 40 million members demand that the dispute between China and [Japan] must be resolved peacefully. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) The British League of Nations Union today telegraphed the Japanese League of Nations Union, hoping that the Japanese Union would use all its influence with its government to seek a peaceful resolution to the Manchurian issue. The reply received stated that the Union has always strived to achieve a peaceful resolution to the Manchurian case, and that the special and extremely complex situation in Manchuria makes it difficult to apply ordinary standards, but it hopes that the truth will be clear everywhere in the future.

<p>Please Note Obligations Under the Pact</p>

<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Reply</p>
<h3>Notes from England, France, and Other Countries</h3>
<p>Deeply Desire Strict Adherence to Pact Obligations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently replied to the governments of England, France, Germany, Norway, Italy, Poland, and Yugoslavia, stating: "Regarding the reply, we have received your government's note in which your government draws the attention of the Chinese government to the provisions of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of June 27, 1926, and expresses the hope that the Chinese and Japanese governments will avoid taking any steps that would endanger the success of ongoing efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the situation in China. Since September 18th, Japanese troops have disregarded international law and the Kellogg-Briand Pact and other international conventions, and have begun unprovoked attacks on Shenyang and other places. The government of your country is deeply concerned about the subsequent expansion of this matter in the Northeast, for which the Chinese government is deeply grateful. China deeply desires to strictly adhere to the obligations that it should bear in accordance with international conventions, especially the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. With regard to Japan's military aggression, China has made every effort to avoid contact with it by force, and from the beginning has attempted to seek a just and appropriate solution through peaceful means. Therefore, we have made every effort to refer the entire case to the League of Nations. Our absolute reliance on the solemn pledges contained in the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the League of Nations Covenant, and other international conventions for maintaining peace is based on the full belief that Japan will recognize its legal and moral responsibilities to human civilization. The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the efforts currently underway in Geneva to resolve this case for the sake of justice and peace will soon be successful. This effort is not only for the well-being of China, but also for the well-being of the world. As for the Chinese government, it will continue to persist in its efforts to seek peaceful means to resolve all problems of any nature, and will do its utmost to assist the League of Nations in devising a permanent system to ensure the effective observance of this policy in the Far East in the future. A corresponding reply is sent to your minister for your information, and we hope that you will convey it to your government. A note is required. (Special Dispatch, 21st)"</p>
<h3>Japanese Reply to Notes from Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After receiving notes from various countries asking it to pay attention to its obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Japan now plans to [draft] a document, divided into three sections: (1) Stating that Japan is well aware of its obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and that its actions have always been purely for self-defense and that it has no intention of resorting to war. (2) Japan has already stated that it is willing to negotiate with responsible representatives from China, and that the small number of Japanese soldiers stationed outside the railway zone should not be seen as tools for imposing conditions. (3) The anti-Japanese movement in China stops business dealings, which is not a random action by individuals but is enforced by groups. They arbitrarily legislate and severely punish Chinese who do not comply with their methods. The anti-Japanese movement has not diminished to this day, and the Chinese government tacitly approves of this measure as a tool to achieve its national goals, which directly violates the letter and spirit of Article 11 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact.

<h3>Still Wants to Reinforce Troops in Manchuria</h3>
<p>Using the Excuse of Preventing Banditry</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government continues to oppose the proposal to reinforce troops in Manchuria, but according to reliable sources, military authorities still advocate sending troops to Manchuria, according to the number of soldiers allowed by the treaty, to fulfill their military duties. They believe that the original garrison troops have frequent patrols and are already working hard and still need to prevent banditry. Also, the climate is getting colder, the supply is insufficient, and deaths are gradually increasing. Minister of the Army Minami reported to the cabinet that the Chinese soldiers stationed near Jinzhou have built defensive works along the Liao River, estimating that there are about 200,000 Chinese soldiers there, with 48 artillery units. There are also unrest news in the Jiandao area, but no incidents have been reported. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Understanding That Student Soldiers Should Have</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident broke out, due to the pressure of the grave situation, all secondary and higher schools across the country have temporarily added military training courses, arming students as a preparation for self-defense and self-rescue. This kind of preparation is truly necessary and is a practical good plan for safeguarding the survival and freedom of our nation.</p>
<p>The nation spends over 80% of its annual budget on the military, yet in the face of foreign aggression, it is still unable to resist. It has no choice but to prepare to sacrifice a portion of our young students' studies and time to engage in military courses, taking action to defend against tyranny. This kind of phenomenon is truly heartbreaking. Therefore, before accepting military training and preparing for armament, student youths should earnestly understand the meaning of military training and the points they themselves should strive for.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of military training? In a word, it is to mobilize everything to fight for the right of survival of our country and nation, and to fight for the freedom and equality of our country and nation. The Japanese imperialists are our current great enemy. Their implementation of violent oppression has placed our country on the line between life and death, with survival hanging by a thread. All of our people should mobilize as a whole, urgently preparing for self-defense. We student youths should especially rise up together as the vanguard of mobilizing the entire nation. This kind of military training differs in meaning from military education that aims to invade other countries. The difference is that we are for self-defense, we are for safeguarding the right of survival of our nation. Apart from this, we have absolutely no ambition to invade other countries. Only by being able to defend ourselves can we have peace. Only by being able to defend ourselves can we establish a nation. Only then can we safeguard the right of survival of our nation. In today's world where tyranny runs rampant and justice is submerged, all of our people should have this understanding. We student youths should especially have this understanding. Recognizing this point is precisely how we recognize the great significance of schools implementing military training and arming students today.</p>
<p>Indeed, our country's current great enemy is Japan, and the current goal of armed students is to resist Japan. But we must recognize that in Japan, there are indeed many citizens who sympathize with our country and oppose the violent actions of their government. Those who advocate invading our country are a minority of ambitious military cliques and politicians. Those who invade us are our enemies, while those who sympathize with us are our friends. Therefore, what we today recognize as necessary to overthrow is Japanese imperialism. In other words, the ambitious military cliques and politicians of Japan, and not the entire Japanese people.</p>
<p>Secondly, students and youths across the country have now been practically armed. But we believe that formal armament is secondary, while spiritual armament is even more important. To arm the body, one must first arm the spirit. If one cannot invigorate the spirit, strengthen the will, and thoroughly eradicate the past habits of following old ways and being lazy, then even if one has formal weapons, where will they be used? And what good will they do? Therefore, today's armed student youths should pay attention to arming the spirit and should earnestly take in the lessons from past facts.</p>
<p>Today, the student army is entrusted with the survival of our country and nation, and its responsibility is extremely heavy. Moreover, this kind of armament is a true armament of the people, a force that is truly capable of safeguarding the nation. Therefore, today's student army should earnestly understand its responsibilities, should persevere, should value what it does, should be orderly in its steps, and should strive for practicality. Do not let this military training devolve into military formalism, causing this important work to fail and missing the last opportunity to fight for national survival and freedom.</p>

<h3>Deputy Minister of Propaganda of the Central Executive Committee, Chen Cheng, Requests Punishment</h3>
<p>Due to Central News Agency's Erroneous Release of International News</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Bulei and Cheng Tianfang, Deputy Ministers of Propaganda of the Central Executive Committee, presented a request to the Central Executive Committee for punishment because of the erroneous release of international news by the Central News Agency. The original request stated that Bulei and Tianfang are responsible for propaganda, and since their review was incomplete and their supervision was ineffective, resulting in a major error, their dereliction of duty is undeniable. In addition to ordering the various newspapers in this city to publish an extra edition stating the cause of the error, and ordering the Central News Agency to conduct its own investigation into the actual situation, they respectfully request the Central Executive Committee to impose severe punishment to enforce discipline and to warn against future occurrences. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the news release issued by this agency on the 20th, it stated, "(Geneva) Telegram on the 19th, The League of Nations' thirteen-nation secret meeting today decided on five key points for resolving the Manchurian Incident: (1) Japanese troops withdraw to within the South Manchurian Railway zone; (2) China effectively protects the lives and property of Japanese residents, with an explicit statement; (4) China must respect previous Sino-Japanese treaties and (Japanese) vested interests in Manchuria and Mongolia; (5) After the above four points are decided, direct negotiations between China and Japan." The original source was a broadcast message from the Osaka Broadcasting Station of Japan. There was no telegram from Geneva, and there was no formal report from our representative. It was all an atmosphere created by the Japanese side. The Central Propaganda Department received this message on the radio. In addition to recording and sending it to relevant agencies so that they would know that the Japanese side had this kind of saying, it also routinely sent a copy to this agency for reference. However, due to busy affairs, the word "reference" was missed. This agency overlooked it for a moment, and seeing that it was news about the League of Nations, mistakenly believed that it was a telegram from Geneva received by the Ministry, so it added the words "Geneva, 19th." As a result, the newspapers in this city published it today, and some even added large-character headlines, causing social unrest. Chen Bulei and Cheng Tianfang, Deputy Ministers of Propaganda of the Central Executive Committee, discovered this mistake on the morning of the 21st. After investigating the cause, they deeply regretted that this error was extremely serious. Their duty was to take responsibility for the mistake and have already submitted a report to the Central Executive Committee requesting severe punishment.

<h3>The Situation in Spain is Grave</h3>
<p>Parliament urgently passes special legislation</p>
<p>Reuter's 21st, Madrid: Spain may be on the verge of civil war, so Parliament hastily passed a grand plan to defend the republic in a single meeting. One of the provisions authorizes the authorities to severely punish troublemakers, such as those who incite others to riot, incite electrical workers to strike, raise food prices, and unenthusiastic officials. Because unrest is occurring everywhere, the number of unemployed is increasing daily, labor strikes are frequent, and Catholic party members have withdrawn from Parliament, the possibility of civil war is becoming increasingly imminent. It is rumored that members of the Society of Jesus are indignant about the government's anti-religious tendencies and are preparing to resist any government interference or confiscation of their property by force.</p>
<h3>Undercurrents Surge in German Political Parties</h3>
<p>National, 20th, Berlin: Since Prime Minister Brüning's astonishing victory in the Reichstag last time, huge undercurrents have clearly emerged within the various German political parties. Now there is a danger of them collapsing and overflowing, and this is especially evident between the National People's Party and the Economic Party. The leaders of both parties had issued announcements in advance, ordering their party members in the Reichstag to jointly cast anti-government votes on the vote of no confidence in the cabinet, but the result was the opposite. The entire Economic Party did not approve of the anti-government resolution, and the National People's Party members split into three factions when voting: one was the anti-government faction, one was the pro-government faction, and the other did not express approval or disapproval and did not vote. It is now rumored that the leaders of the Economic Party have proposed punishing the rebel party members, but this proposal was opposed by all party members and could not be established, and they issued a declaration, saying that they were unwilling to bear the heavy responsibility of overthrowing the Brüning cabinet. A portion of the anti-party figures in the National People's Party are mostly directed at the leader Ding Qitai. If there is no definite solution, the anti-party atmosphere may expand further, especially in southern Germany, because southern Germany respects Brüning more than northern Germany.</p>
<h3>Austrian Foreign Minister Resolute to Resign</h3>
<p>National News Agency, 20th, Vienna: Austrian Foreign Minister Schober has now submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Dr. Boretscher. Boretscher is still considering it.

His first resignation was after the failure of the German-Austrian customs union and after returning to Austria after the Geneva meeting. He then withdrew his resignation after being persuaded to stay. The reason for this resignation is that former Prime Minister Seipel vigorously attacked him, making it impossible for him to be at ease in his position. It is said that Schober's resignation this time is quite resolute.</p>
<h3>The Question of Ten Countries Joining the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Conditioned on obtaining a permanent seat on the Council</p>
<p>Kemal's conversation with reporters</p>
<p>National, 20th, Itabor, Turkey: According to a conversation between Turkish President Kemal and reporters, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov will arrive in Turkey soon, but Kemal declared that Turkey's attitude towards the League of Nations will not be changed by the will of Soviet Russia. It is rumored that Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov's visit to Turkey this time will put pressure on Turkey to prevent it from joining the League of Nations, which is unfounded. Kemal also said that Turkey has long been preparing to join the League of Nations, but will only do so after the League of Nations allows Turkey to have a permanent seat on the Council. This point was stated earlier when Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü met with French Foreign Minister Briand. Kemal also stated regarding the upcoming Second Balkan Conference that the only slogan for this meeting is the four words "peace and friendship," which are also Turkey's diplomatic policy. In addition to the full attendance of the Balkan Peninsula countries at the Second Balkan Conference, other European countries such as Germany, France, and Italy will have informal representatives participating as observers.</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Ends the Manchurian Incident Haphazardly</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Standing Committee closed on the 30th</p>
<p>The demands made by our representative have not been resolved</p>
<p>Geneva Special Dispatch: Regarding the Manchurian Incident, it has been almost two weeks since our representative handed it over to the League of Nations Executive Council for resolution. Our country has not made the slightest progress so far. The several demands made by our representative Shi Zhaoji have not received satisfactory replies, such as (1) requesting Japan to withdraw its troops as soon as possible and restore the pre-war state, (2) requesting Japan to compensate for the losses suffered due to its aggression, (3) requesting the League of Nations to organize an investigative committee to observe the truth of the incident, and (4) advocating that the Executive Council be responsible for resolving the matter and opposing Japan's proposal for direct negotiations. Regarding items (2), (3), and (4), because the Japanese representative insisted on opposing them, our side did not make fierce rebuttals, so the above three items have so far yielded no results, and the Executive Council has also turned a deaf ear. Regarding the withdrawal of troops as soon as possible, the chairman of the Executive Council once advised the Chinese and Japanese troops to withdraw to their respective national defense areas. This method is not only ridiculous, but also illogical. This time, Japan is attacking us alone, and the Chinese troops are in a position of being attacked and have not left Chinese territory by a single step. Now the Executive Council orders the Chinese troops to withdraw at the same time as the Japanese troops. Where should the Chinese troops withdraw to? This is already unreasonable, and what is more, the Japanese troops have not only not withdrawn so far, but are increasing daily. The Japanese representative said that the Japanese troops have withdrawn a portion, which is simply a cover-up. Although the Executive Council knows that it is a lie by the Japanese representative, it has to pretend to be deaf and dumb for fear of Japan's arrogance. This kind of ostrich-like method is completely contrary to the purpose of the League of Nations to maintain peace. No wonder the actions of the Council this time have been strongly criticized by impartial people all over the world.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of September 30th, the League of Nations Executive Council held a closing meeting. First, the chairman read aloud to the meeting the results of the "Five-Headed Conference." The so-called "Five-Headed Conference" was a preliminary meeting of representatives from England, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. The major plans of the Executive Council are decided here. Its nature is equivalent to the "Three-Headed Conference" of the Paris Peace Conference era, so the Executive Council meeting is only a formality on the surface. The results of this "Five-Headed Conference" are translated as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Executive Council has learned that the governments of China and Japan have replied to the urgent advice given by the chairman of the Council and has learned that the two governments have taken various measures in accordance with this advice.</p>
<p>2. The Council considers the Japanese government's statement that it has no intention of occupying Manchuria to be very important. (Note: Japan has been planning to annex Manchuria for a long time.)</p>
<p>3. The Council is aware of the statement made by the Japanese government that the government will, within the scope possible, quickly withdraw its troops that have already begun to return to the railway boundary.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<h3>Continuation of Important News</h3>
<p>limit, but the safety of the lives and property of the Japanese people must have a definite guarantee, and the Japanese government hopes that this wish will be realized soon.</p>
<p>4. The Council has learned of the Chinese representative's statement that the government will, after the Japanese troops withdraw one after another and the Chinese police and local authorities are restored, assume full responsibility for the safety of the lives and property of the Japanese people living outside the railway boundary. (Note: Our authorities have never shirked their responsibility to protect Japanese nationals.)</p>
<p>5. The Council has learned that the Chinese and Japanese representatives have guaranteed that their respective governments will take necessary measures to prevent the incident from escalating. Therefore, the Council firmly believes that the two governments have the desire to maintain peace and friendly relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>6. The Council requests both parties to restore past friendly relations as soon as possible and hopes that the two governments should immediately fulfill the above-mentioned obligations that have already been promised.</p>
<p>7. The Council requests both parties to make complete reports to the Council on the progress of this matter in the future.</p>
<p>8. The Council decided to convene another special meeting on October 14th (Wednesday) to discuss the situation regarding this matter at that time, but if any unexpected emergency occurs, the Council can convene earlier.</p>
<p>9. The Chairman of the Executive Council, regarding the progress of this incident,</p>
<p>Upon consulting with the members, the representatives of China and Japan, or others, if it is considered that there is no need to convene a meeting on October 14th, the chairman may cancel the decision to convene the meeting.</p>
<p>After the chairman of the Executive Council read it aloud, the Japanese representative immediately spoke to express his approval. The representative of our country stated that he reserved our country's claim for compensation for losses and said that he hoped that the Japanese troops should be completely withdrawn before October 14th, otherwise China would take necessary measures, etc. Finally, the chairman said that if there were no other opinions at the meeting, it would be considered unanimously approved. The meeting adjourned after he spoke. Looking at the results of this meeting comprehensively, Japan has won completely. What our country has obtained from the League of Nations is only a piece of paper with black and white writing. I wonder what the readers will think when they see this.</p>
<p>The failure of our country's diplomacy this time and the suspicion that the League of Nations Executive Council is partial to Japan are undeniable facts, and the weakness of our country's diplomatic personnel in negotiations is also undeniable. This time, our country requested the Executive Council to resolve the Manchurian Incident based on the provisions of Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant. According to this article, any member state has the right to draw the League of Nations' attention when two countries are at war. The so-called "any member state" refers to a third country other than those at war, and its purpose is to maintain peace and does not involve matters such as compensation or organizing an investigative committee. For the convenience of readers, the original text of Article 11 is translated as follows: "(1) ... Any war or threat of war, whether it directly affects member states of this League or not, is a matter of concern to the entire League of Nations, and the League of Nations shall immediately adopt appropriate methods to ensure international peace. Under these circumstances, the Secretary-General shall immediately convene the Executive Council at the request of any member state. (2) ... In the event of a situation affecting international relations and sufficient to disturb world peace or harm the friendly relations on which peace depends, any member state, in the name of friendship, has the right to draw the attention of the League of Nations Assembly or the Executive Council." After reading it, we will know that the establishment of this article is aimed at third countries other than those in dispute. Now our country is clearly a country involved and not a third country. What is requested from the Executive Council is to sanction Japan's military aggression and demand compensation for the losses suffered due to the aggression. Now our country is requesting the Executive Council based on Article 11, which can truly be said to be irrelevant. According to the provisions of Article 11, the responsibility of the Executive Council is only to maintain international peace and does not have the power to resolve "punishing the culprit" and "compensation." Our country spent two weeks and did not get the slightest result, which is also due to this reason.</p>
<p>Japan's actions this time clearly violated the provisions of Articles 12, 13, and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. These three articles state that if member states have disputes, they should resolve them by peaceful means and should never resort to war. Those who violate them should be punished according to Article 16 of the same Covenant. The original text of Article 16 is translated as follows: "(1) If a member state resorts to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13, or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not. (2) It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League. (3) ... The members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimize the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State. ... (4) Any Member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League may be declared to be no longer a Member of the League." Japan, using the pretext that China cannot protect its nationals and that the Chinese army destroyed the South Manchuria Railway, directly sent troops to Manchuria, which is clearly an act that violates the League of Nations Covenant, so Article 16 should be applied to punish it. If our country needs to request compensation for losses or organize an investigative committee, then Article 15 should be applied. However, our country's representative did not consider this and requested the League of Nations Executive Council to resolve the matter based on Article 11. What is their intention? We cannot measure their profoundness. (October 1)</p>
<h3>Outbreak of War in Longjiang</h3>
<p>Zhang Haipeng Leads Troops to Invade Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>Yu Zhaolin Tenaciously Defends Jiangqiao Station and Inflicts Heavy Blows</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Appointed Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>The Reasons Behind the Recent Incident</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Zhang Haipeng, the garrison commander of Taonan, incited by the Japanese army, led his troops northward on the 14th to invade Heilongjiang. The Heilongjiang Provincial Government Committee, having received a telegram from the Deputy Commander's Office in Beiping, denounced Zhang's reliance on Japanese power as a rebellious act. Considering the temporary involvement of Japanese influence, the committee decided to tolerate the situation for the time being. To ensure the safety of the provincial capital, they chose a peaceful retreat and relocated the troops to a secure location, postponing further discussion until the Northeast China-Japan issue was resolved. Consequently, Provincial Committee members Zhao Zhongren, Dou Lianfang, and others left the province for Harbin on the evening of the 14th. Wan Fulin's family members also sought refuge in Harbin. Only a small number of police officers remained in the provincial capital to maintain order. Fearing looting by Zhang's troops during the transition in the provincial capital, merchants in the capital dispatched representatives to Tailai Town on the evening of the 14th to welcome Zhang's army. Zhang's army had planned to occupy Longsha on the morning of the 15th. At 6 PM on the 14th, a brigade of cavalry and over 7,000 Mongolian soldiers colluded with them and arrived at Tailai Town on three trains. At 8 PM, they continued their advance, reaching the area of Kaerge. Suddenly, Yu Zhaolin's brigade at Jiangqiao Station blew up the bridge, halting Zhang's army's progress. Many of the soldiers in this brigade were former members of Han Guangdi's brigade during the anti-Russian campaign in the 18th year of the Republic (1929). Enraged by Zhang's arrogance, they disobeyed their brigade commander's orders and, with all 5,000 men, defended the area, preventing Zhang's army from advancing. Unable to cross, Zhang's army stopped there. On the morning of the 16th, Yu's brigade launched a fierce cross-river attack on Zhang's army at dawn, with intense artillery fire, inflicting significant losses on Zhang's army, which retreated several miles. At noon, two Japanese aircraft provided cover for the cavalry of Zhang's brigade as they attacked Yu's brigade. The aircraft dropped several heavy bombs. Despite their smaller numbers, Yu's troops were highly motivated and resisted desperately. The fierce battle continued until dusk and resumed in the evening, and there has been no definite news up to this morning. However, Gao Renfu, the director of the Xing'an Reclamation Bureau, has led the Sun and Wang regiments from the Solun Mountain area to attack the rear of Zhang's army, assisting Yu's brigade in a pincer movement. Zhang's army is now facing enemies on both sides and cannot succeed. At the same time, Wu Songshan's 1st Cavalry Brigade from Zhaodong and Zhang Zhanjiu's 2nd Cavalry Brigade from Fularji are rushing to Jiangqiao Station to assist Yu's brigade. Zhang's troops are mostly cavalry, lack heavy artillery, and have little actual combat experience, making them inferior to Yu's brigade and the reclamation troops. The situation is expected to be resolved within a day or two. Zhang Jinghui, the chief of the Special District administration, is an old friend of Zhang Haipeng. Seeing Zhang in dire straits, he sent his advisor, Lei Chun, to Jiangqiao on the evening of the 14th to persuade both sides to cease hostilities and for Zhang's troops to return to Taonan. The distant cause of Zhang's armed rebellion is that Zhang and the late Zhang Zuolin and Wu Junsheng were very close friends. He is considered a veteran among the warlords in the Northeast. His cavalry is brave and skilled in battle. After Wu Junsheng was promoted to the position of Military Governor of Heilongjiang in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), Zhang succeeded Wu as the garrison commander of Taoliao and has held the position for many years, gaining considerable prestige in the Mongolian border area. After Wu Junsheng's death, when the position of Military Governor of Heilongjiang became vacant, Zhang felt that he was the most qualified candidate. However, the position was taken by Wan Fulin, which made him quite unhappy. Later, when Zhang Xueliang took office and appointed Zou Zuohua as the Director of the Xing'an Reclamation Bureau, Zhang's influence was greatly reduced, and Xueliang did not treat Zhang (Haipeng) very well. As a result, Zhang became increasingly depressed. Recently, with the Japanese occupation of Liaoning and Jilin, they incited Zhang. After Prince Gong arrived in Liaoning, he named Zhang as the General of Heilongjiang in the name of the Ming Dynasty Empire. Zhang was still hesitant and had not yet made a decision. His son, Zhiming, was fascinated by the power of the Crown Prince and urged his father, also contacting the Japanese consulate in Tongliao. On the 5th of this month, 10,000 rifles and 400,000 rounds of ammunition were delivered, and Zhang finally made up his mind. He then colluded with Mongolian bandits, detained the Tao'ang train, and Zhang Zhiming went to Heilongjiang on the 9th to directly demand political power from the Heilongjiang provincial government. Zhang is now 67 years old and nearing the end of his life. His old friends are very saddened by this act of treason. Before Zhang launched his rebellion, Wan Fulin, seeing that no one was in charge of provincial affairs and that he could not immediately return north, discussed the matter with Deputy Commander Zhang and agreed to resign from the position of chairman and appoint Ma Zhanshan, the garrison commander of Heihe, as acting chairman. Ma led his troops to Longsha on the morning of the 16th and took office at noon, suppressing unrest. With someone in charge of the Heilongjiang provincial government, Zhang Haipeng's rebellion is not a cause for concern. Here is Wan Fulin's telegram to the elders of Heilongjiang Province from Beiping: "Fulin was ordered to enter the customs due to military affairs and has been away for five months. I am extremely disturbed by the long absence from my duties. Just as I thought the military affairs were over and I could return to the province, the Shenyang Incident of September 18th occurred. Jiang Province is located on the border, with vast territory and few soldiers. Foreign aggression is worrying, and the uprisings of bandits and Red elements are concerning. The occurrence of incidents is unpredictable. Fulin is stranded in Beiping and cannot return immediately, making it difficult to manage affairs remotely. I have now submitted a request to Deputy Commander Zhang and asked the National Government to remove me from the position of chairman of the provincial government and appoint a capable person to take charge. I only remember that Fulin has been governing Jiang for three years and has been gradually developing industries and schools to help the people's livelihood and enlighten knowledge. Now, I have stopped halfway and have nothing to show for it, which is deeply regrettable. But at this time of hardship, people's hearts are fluctuating, and conspiracies and heresies are easily agitated. A little carelessness can lead to the destruction of security, and the consequences are unimaginable. I hope that my elders and children will warn each other not to be moved by rumors or misled by fallacies. Everyone should settle down in their own business so as not to do evil. Internal security is the prerequisite for resisting foreign aggression. These are the words that Fulin cannot help but say. I hope you all will take them to heart." (16th)</p>
<p>Taonan Dispatch: After being incited by the Japanese, Zhang Haipeng, the garrison commander of Taoliao, carried out a rebellion and sent troops to invade Heilongjiang. The details of the situation are recorded as follows. Zhang Haipeng originally came from the banditry, known as "Daxiang." After surrendering, his army was quite despised by the general public because his army had no order. Zhang was ridiculed because of his dark face full of pockmarks, therefore another nickname called "Zhang Da Mazi." Zhang's personality is very simple. After the Liaoning-Jilin Incident, he immediately convened a meeting of the Taonan county magistrate and local gentry and merchants. Zhang was the first to speak, saying that since the provincial capital had fallen, if the Japanese army advanced to this place (i.e., Taonan), we should express our welcome to avoid the people suffering from the ravages of war. At that time, all the participants in the meeting agreed with Zhang's proposal and unanimously approved it. Later, on the 25th of last month, a small number of Japanese troops arrived in Taonan and immediately stayed at Zhang's private residence. In addition to guiding the Japanese soldiers to visit various places every day, Zhang also secretly discussed the plan for independence with the Japanese day and night. One day, Zhang led the Japanese to visit the Taonan Private Zhuqing School, which was founded by Wu's wife, Ms. Li Zhuqing, with private funds of hundreds of thousands of yuan, and was quite large in scale. When visiting the auditorium, Zhang saw the portrait of Sun Yat-sen hanging on the wall and immediately criticized it to please the Japanese. The school feared Zhang's power and had to remove Sun Yat-sen's portrait. By the end of last month, his rebellion plan had matured. Zhang led his troops to harass Heilongjiang. The Japanese promised to supply Zhang's troops with 20,000 large rifles, and ammunition would be replenished at any time. Up to now, the Japanese have transported a total of six trains of machinery and ammunition to Taonan, including more than 6,000 rifles and more than 2 million rounds of ammunition, all of which were produced by the Northeast Arsenal. The first batch arrived at Taonan Station on the first of this month. On the evening of the 3rd, the ammunition truck suddenly retreated one station from Taonan. Zhang had dispatched more than a dozen cars in advance to wait there. When the ammunition truck arrived, all the ammunition was unloaded and transported to the garrison commander's office by Zhang's cars. The train immediately rushed back to Shenyang. The next day, Zhang claimed that the Japanese ammunition was intended to supply Mongolian bandits and had been rejected by him and returned to Shenyang. Zhang was very happy to receive this large batch of machinery and ammunition, so he convened his subordinates to hold secret meetings day and night to discuss the conspiracy to attack Heilongjiang. Zhang's subordinates unanimously elected Zhang as the Commander-in-Chief of Border Defense. At the same time, eight major offices were organized, and directors of each office were assigned. The matter was heard by the subordinates of the new favorites, such as orderlies, and they were all happily showing joy, so they spread the word everywhere. Later, it was heard by the station master of Taonan Station on the Taoang Railway, and the station master immediately telegraphed Wan Guobin, the director of the Taoang Railway Bureau, to report that Zhang Haipeng had a secret plan to attack Heilongjiang. After receiving the telegram, Wan not only transferred all the vehicles on the entire line to Ang'angxi, but also telegraphed Zhang Haipeng to test his intentions. The general idea of ​​the telegram was: "The Heilongjiang province area is important, and my father is in Ping. Colleagues unanimously welcome you (referring to Mr. Zhang) to Heilongjiang to help preside over everything." After receiving the telegram, Zhang thought that the Heilongjiang province had welcomed him to come, as desired, so he replied that he had been repeatedly oppressed by the Japanese in Tao and was planning to go to Heilongjiang to take refuge temporarily. After reading this telegram, Wan knew that Zhang was indeed intending to attack Heilongjiang, so he sent Zhang another urgent telegram, saying that he had just received an urgent telegram from the Deputy Commander, saying that Taonan was the first gateway to Heilongjiang and was of great importance to Heilongjiang province, so please do not give it up lightly. After reading this telegram, Zhang thought that since Wan had telegraphed to stop him, he figured that the opportunity had been leaked, so he decided to launch immediately. At that time, Taonan was repairing barracks, and there were more than a thousand workers. Zhang ordered that all the workers be changed into soldiers and organized into regiments, with the head foreman as the regimental commander, and the other small foremen as battalion commanders, company commanders, platoon leaders, etc. At the same time, the machinery, ammunition, and clothing supplied by the Japanese and transported from the Northeast Clothing Factory were all distributed to the workers for use. They then marched to Heilongjiang. However, most of these workers had property in the local area, so many of them fled back midway. Zhang then recruited Mongolian bandits and moved towards Wu Tai Bei. On the way, they first encountered the reclamation army and immediately bombarded each other. The Mongolian bandits were mostly scattered, but the reclamation army was afraid of being outnumbered, so they retreated and joined forces with the Heilongjiang army. They are now prepared to defeat the rebel army. (October 17)</p>
<h3>Japanese Release of Sino-Japanese Notes on Troop Withdrawal Issue</h3>
<p>The National Government had sent a note to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations, Japanese troops occupying the territory be withdrawn by October 14, and that China take over and be responsible for restoring security in various places. Japan replied to the note, refusing to comply. The National Government then sent another note, continuing the previous proposal, but the Japanese side did not respond. The aforementioned notes are of great importance. When Ambassador Jiang sent the first note, because it contained a deadline for troop withdrawal, the international press temporarily regarded it as containing the nature of an ultimatum, and there was much speculation and whispering. However, the original text has not yet been released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, the aforementioned notes have been released by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and we are translating them as follows:</p>
<p>Ambassador Jiang's Note to Shidehara: "I received a telegram from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 4th of this month stating that the representative of the Japanese government formally declared in the League of Nations that the Japanese troops currently occupying various places should be withdrawn as soon as possible, and that the state before September 18 should be restored. The final resolution of the Executive Yuan also stated that the Japanese troops should be withdrawn entirely before the meeting on the 14th of this month. The National Government has already telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang on the 2nd of this month to appoint the commander of the troops in various places so that they can take over various places after the withdrawal of the Japanese troops and be responsible for restoring security in various places. The deputy commander has now selected Zhang Zuoxiang and Wang Shuchang to take over. I pray that you will notify the Japanese government to order the Japanese troops to contact the takeover officers sent by our side to complete the handover before the 14th of this month." October 5,</p>
<p>Shidehara's Reply to Ambassador Jiang's Note: "Regarding the troop withdrawal mentioned in your note, the Japanese representative in the League of Nations stated that the premise for Japan's... to the attached territories is that the safety of railways and the lives and property of Japanese subjects in Manchuria can be ensured. As for the resolution of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations on September 30, there is no provision that the Japanese troops should be withdrawn entirely before the reopening of the meeting on the 14th. Regarding the matters mentioned in the second half of your note, the Japanese government's views are as follows: 1. Since the conflict between the Japanese and Chinese troops near Fengtian in the middle of the night on September 18, the Japanese troops have begun to operate on the entire line in Manchuria. This is because there were superior troops stationed around them, and they had to strike first to eliminate the threat. Although the Chinese troops declared a policy of non-resistance at that time, they actually tried to resist everywhere, causing many casualties to the Japanese troops. 2. Although the Chinese government has declared that it will send Zhang Zuoxiang and Wang Shuchang to contact the Japanese troops to take over the task of maintaining security in various places after the withdrawal of the Japanese troops, if the Chinese troops are armed and assembled in various places, even if their purpose is to maintain local security, the Japanese troops cannot help but feel the same major threat as at the time of the outbreak of the incident. Moreover, when the feelings of the people of China and Japan are excited, the danger of conflict between the troops of the two countries is even greater. 3. The Japanese government believes that the urgent task at present is to ease the feelings of the people. Therefore, the two countries should quickly agree on several basic outlines that can serve as the foundation for establishing normal relations. After the agreement on these outlines, when the feelings of the people are eased, the Japanese troops can withdraw entirely into the South Manchuria Railway attached territory. At the same time, the task of taking over security maintenance can also be easily and satisfactorily implemented. 4. The Japanese government can at any time consult with the responsible Chinese representatives on the aforementioned fundamental outlines." October 9,</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Jilin</h3>
<p>British and American Embassy Staff Come to Jilin for Inspection</p>
<p>Xi Qia Hires Three More Japanese Advisors</p>
<p>Mr. Hipple Myers, the U.S. Consul General in Shenyang, Mr. George Hanson, the U.S. Consul General in Harbin, and Mr. Sussabury, the second secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Japan, came to Jilin a few days ago to inspect everything and meet with Chinese and Japanese authorities. They have now completed their work and left Jilin. In addition, two counselors from the British Embassy in China, along with the British Consul General in Liaoning, a group of three people, came to Jilin today (the 15th) to investigate everything. The Japanese army searched various schools above the middle school level, confiscating many books, most of which were related to the Three People's Principles and Japan, and declared that they would be severely punished if they were found again.</p>
<p>The Japanese military authorities believe that the news about the Eastern Provinces published in the Chinese newspapers in China proper is not conducive to them. They notified the postal authorities the day before yesterday that they were not allowed to deliver them. Therefore, newspapers such as Shen Xin and Dagong have disappeared in Jilin and only the Chinese-Japanese newspapers such as Taidong and Manchuria Shengjing are seen.</p>
<p>General Shigeru Honjo, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, arrived in Jilin today on the Jilin-Changchun train. Xi Qia personally welcomed him. After Honjo inspected the Japanese army, he returned to Shenyang on the afternoon of 5 o'clock.</p>
<p>Xi Qia, at the request of the Japanese army, hired Lieutenant Colonel Omote Michiki, the former Japanese military advisor to the Border Defense, as the military advisor to the pseudo-chief executive's office, and also hired Yūichi Hamada, director of the Mantetsu Public Office, and Masaaki Mitsuhashi, chairman of the Resident Association, as political advisors.</p>
<p>The Provincial Post Office has suspended the opening of money orders to postal areas outside of Jilin and Heilongjiang since yesterday (the 14th), and the money houses have also stopped remittances, thus cutting off the economic ties between China proper and abroad.</p>
<p>Xi Qia appointed Jin Bidong (Prince Su of the Qing Dynasty) as the director of the Jilin-Changchun and Jilin-Dundhua Railway Bureaus and the head of the Changchun Municipal Preparation Office. Jin holds three important positions concurrently, all due to the power of the Japanese. It is said that Jin's sisters are all married to Japanese, and his wife is also Japanese, making him completely Japanized.</p>
<p>Hiberly, a British reporter for the Shenyang International News Agency, and a group of five people arrived in Jilin a few days ago to investigate the truth about Jilin. (October 15)</p>
<h3>Li Youlan Talks About the Situation in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Tianjin News: Li Youlan, the supervisor of the Benxi Lake Coal Mine Company, was a member of the local maintenance association initiated after the Liaoning Incident last month. He arrived in Tianjin from Shenyang the day before yesterday. A reporter made a special visit to interview him. Mr. Li talked about the details of the Shenyang Local Maintenance Association in great detail, saying, "After the incident on the night of the 18th of last month, I (Li, I referred to myself) immediately sent someone to risk finding the Chinese manager of Okura Gumi on the next morning, informed the director of Okura Gumi and conveyed my intention: the area must not be allowed to deteriorate, and they should find a way to maintain it. The director of Okura Gumi agreed with this and immediately visited the Japanese Consul General. The Consul also agreed, but said that he would have to wait for Commander Honjo to arrive before discussing it. On the afternoon of the 19th, Honjo arrived and also agreed. However, he said that he should notify his military police captain, and that he could do his best to accommodate our gentry and merchants' opinions on matters of security in the city. We then tried to find the military police captain, and finally met him in the evening. I raised two points: first, please maintain the electric light factory; second, please maintain the telephone. We will talk about the rest tomorrow. The Japanese followed suit. However, according to the Japanese military's opinion, it was not until a week later that the establishment of a maintenance association was allowed, so it was delayed for several days before it was established. When I first proposed it, Chairman Zang had already agreed, but then Chairman Zang and Jin, the director of education, were both under surveillance, and the people had no leader. I then requested Mr. Yuan Jinkai to take responsibility for maintaining it. Mr. Zhao Xinbo was also invited by us. After the maintenance association was established, there was Jin Liang, who was proposed by the Japanese. We had no objections. We have repeatedly stated to the Japanese that the maintenance association is only responsible for local security, finance, and commerce, and does not concern itself with political issues. After its establishment, it has been working according to this policy. The security police have increased from 600 to 2,000 people, and shops have gradually opened. The Bank of Communications and the Bank of China have resumed business. However, the Japanese initially refused to allow the official bank of the Three Eastern Provinces and the Border Industry Bank to resume business, which took a lot of talking. Later, on the 10th of this month, that is, National Day, at a meeting at the South Manchuria Railway Station, the Japanese proposed that Japanese advisors and inspectors be set up in each department of the official bank. We told them that it was enough to send one person to temporarily check the accounts to understand the contents at any time, so why send so many advisors? But the Japanese insisted on their proposal, and the proposals we made were not passed. At this time, I felt that Shenyang could no longer be stayed. I have not been in politics for years, but have been managing official business. This incident has caused panic and danger among the people to the extreme. In order to reduce the suffering of the people, I cannot but come out and use the status of the people to temporarily mediate, but I am confident that my colleagues' patriotism is no less than that of others, and I will never do anything to harm the country. Although the general public does not understand and gives me a bad name, the facts will eventually be revealed, so I have no guilt in my heart. I often said in Shenyang, if there is anything that harms the country, I should be shot, not just scolded. That is my one-month-old opinion. However, at the meeting on the 10th, the Japanese ordered us to add a word to the official bank number. I thought that if this continues, we will gradually fall into a vortex and lose my original intention of maintaining the place. Therefore, I did not go home that night after the meeting and left Shenyang the next morning. I have no other intention in coming to Tianjin. I will report to Deputy Commander Zhang in Ping once and then return to Tianjin to be a temporary citizen of Tianjin. As for Benxi Lake, because the Japanese have expelled the Chinese cadres, I have no way to serve there."</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The reporter then asked how the Japanese were spreading the movement for an independent government. Mr. Li replied, "It hasn't reached the point of compulsion. No official Japanese person in charge has approached us, but there are very many Japanese who are spreading and persuading this matter. They are all related to the Japanese military. We have repeatedly and earnestly told these people that this matter is impossible, not only because we have no political ambitions but also because we have a patriotic ideology and cannot do it, and it will be ineffective because there is no basis. The Chinese government will definitely attack us in the future, so we must rely on Japanese protection to be safe. May I ask, what will international opinion think of Japan at that time? Therefore, even for the sake of Japan, since you say you are not occupying the land, you should not cause such trouble. We also said that if you want to form a government, you must ask Chairman Zang to come out. The people still only recognize Zang as the chairman. The chairman also said so. I immediately said that since you agree, can we all start publicizing this matter from today? The Japanese man said that this needs to be considered separately, because many knowledgeable Japanese expatriates do not agree with the military's extreme actions, but they absolutely dare not say so. People from the consulate also said that during this military period, it is inconvenient for consulate personnel to advocate anything, so the rest can be known. The director of Okura Gumi, who has been working hard for the maintenance association, has been blamed by military figures, who said he was biased towards China. The arrogance of the military can be known. Because the Japanese were ineffective in finding us, they turned to find others. I heard that Zhang Xian is one of those they are looking for, but I don't know the details. As for the Shenyang area, it is not easy for them to find people, because the Japanese must choose someone who is well-known in society. Since we are not doing it and Yan Zhaoxi is not doing it, Yan has disbanded his Four People's Association and is the vice-chairman of the local maintenance association. After I left Shenyang, I heard that the Japanese were very unhappy. Later, Mr. Yuan Jinkai signed on my behalf. Mr. Yuan's aim is not to talk about forming a government, not to talk about independence, but to maintain it for one day if he can. If he is forced to be independent, he will also withdraw from the maintenance association and no longer care about anything."</p>
<h3>Shantou Citizens United in Anti-Japanese Resistance</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Japanese soldiers have occupied the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, not only showing no sincerity in withdrawing their troops but instead protesting to the government and demanding the use of force to suppress the patriotic movement of the masses. On the 12th, the Japanese consul stationed in Shantou presented four demands to the Shantou Municipal Government: (1) tear down anti-Japanese slogans on all streets; (2) dispatch police to protect Chinese workers; (3) order Chinese merchants to sell food to the Japanese; and (4) allow Japanese sailors to land to protect Japanese residents. The Municipal Government found these four demands difficult to fulfill and intolerable. The Japanese warship "Tayo" has been in Shantou for many days, with Sakasaka &amp; Co. acting as its food supplier. The warship dispatches a small motorboat to transport supplies from the city. The Municipal Party Headquarters, recognizing the severity of the national crisis, decided on the 13th to send a letter to the Shantou Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, immediately convening all sectors to hold an anti-Japanese demonstration parade. Furthermore, on the 12th, the Shantou Labor Circle National Salvation Association held a joint meeting, electing representatives from the sewing, shipping, stevedoring, railway transport, civilian shipping, United Safety, telegraph, postal, Shantou camphor nine associations as the presidium. It was decided that at 9:00 AM on the 18th, all labor unions would gather at Zhongshan Road to hold a worker demonstration parade. Each team would be responsible for its own order and discipline. Zhang Lingyun and Xu Pingqing initiated the Lingdong People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army, and many men and women have been enthusiastically signing up in recent days. On the 12th, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held an inaugural preparatory meeting, electing Zhang Lingyun and 16 others as preparatory committee members. The office is temporarily located in Zhongshan Park. The Anti-Japanese National Congress first allocated 200 yuan as temporary preparatory expenses. Xiao Yunge and three others were appointed to draft recruitment regulations for the volunteer corps and training rules, with training to begin on November 1st. Additionally, students from secondary schools and above in Shantou have been responsible for investigating and sealing off Japanese goods in designated areas of the city since the 6th. This work is nearly halfway complete, and merchant groups have requested the Anti-Japanese Association to continue the sealing. The Student Anti-Japanese Federation issued a notice today that from the 14th to the 19th, all secondary school students and above will suspend classes to investigate and seal off enemy goods. They also posted notices to all merchants, requiring them to fill out forms listing the names of the goods and apply for sealing within five days, sending people to shout announcements with gongs. Any goods that are missed and not sealed will be sealed within these five days. After this period, if any more enemy goods are discovered, they will be treated as smuggling enemy goods and punished accordingly. Jiao Guang Middle School and Yu Huai Middle School are expanding their anti-Japanese propaganda, dividing into teams to go to nearby cities, towns, and villages to give national salvation speeches. Since the 13th, students have been standing on major thoroughfares, recounting the painful history of national subjugation. Also, on the 12th, Christians and students from church-run schools and kindergartens throughout the city gathered on Zhongshan Road for a parade, marking a new record of Christian participation in the national salvation movement. On that day, Lin Tianduo, Fu Shang, and Chen Zelin were publicly elected as the presidium to hold religious ceremonies, pray for national peace, and sing hymns of Christian soldiers. Resolutions were passed: (1) to telegraph Christians across the country to unite and save China from its peril; (2) to telegraph a request to cease internal strife and jointly resist foreign aggression; (3) to telegraph Japanese Christians, requesting them to uphold justice and maintain peace; (4) to telegraph Christian churches worldwide, advocating justice and maintaining world peace. The Christian parade was extremely orderly, with no slogans advocating overthrow or declaring war. Shantou newspapers have been publishing national salvation and anti-Japanese news from various counties, occupying nearly nine-tenths of the entire space. Telegrams from various groups advocate a united declaration of war against Japan, but in reality, there is little preparation and no concrete plan. On the other hand, the Japanese in Shantou are fully prepared for everything. Women and children have already returned to their country last week. Japanese elementary schools and Toyo schools have been closed. Each time a Japanese ship goes to Taiwan or Shanghai, Japanese naval personnel change into plain clothes and help their expatriates move luggage and important bookkeeping and valuable items onto the ships. They have already been hidden in the Japanese consulate and transported elsewhere. Japanese naval personnel from the Japanese warships often land in plain clothes. The American warship No. 20 and the French warship "Cairon" arrived in Shantou on the 12th. It is rumored that Japan will dispatch its Magong port fleet to Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou, so warships from various countries cannot ignore this either. (October 13)</p>
<h3>In the Anti-Japanese Climax, Han Fuqu Orders All Sectors to Remain Calm</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu, since the occurrence of the Northeast Incident, has repeatedly received orders from the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government to maintain calmness in external affairs and await the central government's resolution. Moreover, Shandong has a large number of Japanese residents, making the situation unique and requiring particularly cautious action to avoid disputes. Yesterday, he specially issued a public notice to all sectors that, from now on, all meetings convened and slogans posted must be subject to review and approval by the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government before they can be held. The text of the public notice is recorded below: "Since the beginning of the Northeast Incident, the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government have repeatedly issued orders by telegram, instructing us to maintain calmness and await the central government's legal resolution, which should be followed accordingly. In this critical autumn of survival and extinction, I, as the chairman governing both military and civilian affairs, bear the responsibility of defending the territory and protecting the people. Learning from the past, I have long held the determination to love the country and the people, aiming to turn danger into safety and achieve a final peaceful victory. This humble intention of mine should be shared by all the elders and brothers in Shandong. As for saving the country and seeking survival, it is a sentiment shared by everyone. However, while patriotism is accompanied by enthusiasm, handling affairs requires consideration of the overall situation. If only useless propaganda is carried out, it will only create disputes and may affect local security. My duty is to maintain peace and order and protect the lives and property of the majority of the people in Shandong. I am determined not to allow the misconduct of a few people to lead to unexpected risks. If there is any unrest in the area, it means that I have not fulfilled my duties. Therefore, I am taking precautions to prevent problems and repeatedly admonishing everyone. For this reason, I hereby issue this notice to all sectors of the public, informing you that from now on, I hope everyone will remain calm. If there are any matters such as convening meetings or posting slogans, they must be reviewed and approved by the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government in advance before they can be held, so as to be cautious. Indeed, it is appropriate to eliminate troubles before they arise, and it is valuable to think about difficulties when angry. If, in case of carelessness, villains take advantage of the situation to create disturbances under the guise of patriotism, leading to harming the country in the name of loving it and harming the people in the name of caring for them, even if there is regret afterward, it will be too late. All my elders and brothers must think about potential problems and take precautions to ensure peace, jointly maintaining the difficult times. This is my only hope." (19th)</p>
<h3>The 44th Meeting of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 44th State Council meeting on the 20th. The attendees were Song Ziwen, Wang Boqun, Yang Shuzhuang, Kong Xiangxi, Lian Shengkai, Liu Ruiheng, and Li Shuhua. Wang Zhijue, Cao Haosen, Zhang Wohua, Lu Bi, and Xu Jingzhi were present as observers. Song Ziwen chaired the meeting. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) Premier Chiang's proposal: To investigate the implementation plans formulated by the former Ministry of Health for various health administration undertakings, it is now proposed to prepare for the establishment of a Central Health Facility Experiment Office. During the preparation period, Health Department Director Liu Ruiheng will be responsible for the preparations. The corresponding proposal is submitted for public decision. Resolution: Approved. (2) Report from the Ministry of Interior: This year's floods have been severe, and emergency relief can only alleviate the immediate situation. The fundamental solution still lies in developing water conservancy. The central government should issue recovery bonds and allocate them according to their importance and urgency, with overall planning. Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces that have been particularly affected by the disaster should be allocated as much as possible. However, relying solely on central recovery bonds is insufficient. Local governments should also find ways to contribute. It is proposed to order the Flood Relief Committee to determine the number of labor and relief workers to be distributed to each province based on the already issued recovery bonds. If there is a shortfall, local governments should be responsible for making up the difference. All projects should be ordered to submit plans based on the approved funds for review and approval and start construction immediately. Are these arrangements appropriate? Requesting instructions. Resolution: Referred to the Flood Relief Committee. (3) Report from the Ministry of Interior: According to the Health Department's report on the revised articles of association of the Central Hospital and the Central Hospital Committee, please review and submit them for record-keeping. After reviewing the revised articles of association, they are generally appropriate and should be approved for record-keeping. A report is submitted for review and implementation. Resolution: Approved for record-keeping.</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence: Jinshan</h3>
<p>Amid Winter Defense, Banditry is Resurgent. After the capture and execution of major bandits like Taibao, Ashu, Zhu, Amei, etc., local figures fear that the remnants cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, they continue to bear a substantial amount of expenses for public security. In addition to a stationed provincial security team of one battalion, there are also police teams, water patrol teams, aquatic provincial public security teams, and local defense corps in each district. It can be said that the defense of the small Jinshan area is quite thorough. Unexpectedly, as the autumn harvest of farmers approaches and rents for each granary are about to begin, cases of robbery have occurred one after another, which is unfortunate for the local area. The following is a record: The day before yesterday (the 17th) night, the home of a certain surname in Xiongshan and the home of Chen Jinchang in Fangxiang Township, just half a li away from Zhang, were both robbed clean by bandits, and the victims were injured. Quite Yesterday (the 18th) at midnight, in the Liujia Yanqiao area, the birthplace of bandits, more than 20 bandits suddenly arrived, openly carrying weapons and surrounding the entire town, searching every household without exception. It is said that the Huang surname butcher shop and a certain southern goods store suffered the greatest losses. Although the area is not far from the military and police station, there is no telephone available, so the bandits were able to calmly leave.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>

Another item proposed by the County Executive Committee was that, as winter defense is approaching, the county government should be requested to prepare for the establishment of a county defense corps as soon as possible to strengthen defense. As a result of the talks, the county government ordered each district to handle the matter quickly in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Robbery Case in Shiqi Tu. Lu, of Shiqi Tu in the 15th District, was suddenly attacked by seven or eight bandits speaking local dialects while he was sleeping on the night of the 18th.

The day before yesterday evening, inspectors from the inspection department seized dozens of pieces of privately hidden enemy goods cloth in the private residence of the manager of Xiecheng Yong, located at No. 20 Donghe Tou Lane in the city. They immediately sealed them up for identification and disposal. Upon hearing the news, the merchants of the store rushed to stop them, not allowing them to be taken away.

<h3>Special Document: Liu Haisu's Report to the Ministry of Education After Returning to China (4)</h3>
<p>In the spring of the 19th year, I went to Italy to conduct research. In the autumn of the same year, I went to Belgium to review the international exhibits at the World's Fair. I also discussed with authorities and art world scholars in both countries, and they all agreed to assist. In the spring of the 20th year, Haisu was invited by the Chinese Academy of the University of Frankfurt, Germany, to lecture on Chinese painting. I repeated the proposal and immediately held an exhibition of modern Chinese paintings at the Frankfurt Art Museum. In June, it was moved to Heidelberg for exhibition. The immense impact at the time was beyond expectation. This was because in the early spring of that year, the Japanese had held a large-scale exhibition in Berlin, where the works were mostly manufactured to cater to the psychology of Europeans. As a result, Europeans felt that Eastern art was merely imitating the superficial aspects of Europeanization without showing its unique strengths. Upon seeing the exhibition of modern Chinese paintings, they were surprised and impressed. The art was simple and natural, without artificiality, which was incomparable to the Japanese's laborious efforts to create falsehoods. The embassy also felt that it was necessary to hold an exhibition of modern Chinese paintings in Berlin after seeing the German press coverage. Therefore, they telegraphed Haisu, urging him to go to Berlin. I formally negotiated with the Prussian Academy of Arts, the Oriental Art Society, and other institutions, and repeatedly discussed with Oriental scholars, Professor Kuemmel of the University of Berlin, Professor Amersdörfer, Vice President of the Academy of Art, Professor Parschmen of the Department of Engineering, and others in detail. Finally, the embassy formally signed an agreement with the Oriental Art Society to hold the exhibition in February 1934, with the Prussian Academy of Art as the exhibition venue. Ten German committee members and one representative from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs were recommended.</p>
<p>President of the German Oriental Art Association, former German Ambassador to Japan, Solf</p>
<p>Vice President of the German Oriental Art Association, Doctor of Engineering, Klemperer</p>
<p>Secretary General of the German Oriental Art Association, Director of the Oriental Museum, Professor Kuemmel of the University of Berlin</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary General of the German Oriental Art Association, Director of the National Museum, Cohn</p>
<p>Professor of the Berlin University of Technology, Government Building Consultant, Boerschmann</p>
<p>Director of the National Art Library, Professor Glaser of the University of Berlin</p>
<p>Chief Accountant of the German Oriental Art Association, Dr. Ginsberg</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Accountant of the German Oriental Art Association, Count vonareHeydt</p>
<p>Secretary General of the Prussian Academy of Art, Professor Amersdörfer of the University of Berlin</p>
<p>China first recommended the Minister and Vice Minister of Education, the Director of the Central Research Institute, the Minister to Germany, and Haisu as committee members to carry out preparations. The remaining six people will be added later.</p>
<p>The process of these negotiations was fraught with difficulties. With the basic outline in place and a path vaguely formed, Haisu returned to his homeland to appeal to the government and to the people of the country, hoping that everyone would work together to make it a success, and not allow the Japanese to usurp the role of the master of the East. This is what Haisu has hoped for day and night.</p>
<h3>Humble Suggestions Regarding Chinese Art Facilities</h3>
<p>Since Haisu's travels in Europe, I have seen the grand scale and profound significance of the art facilities in various countries, and I have been deeply impressed and unable to contain myself. Looking at my homeland, I feel sad and heartbroken. This is because China has thousands of years of rich artistic heritage that far surpasses Europe. However, due to the lack of proper preservation and development methods, it has been buried and neglected. As a result, later scholars cannot fully appreciate the achievements of previous generations, nor can they pursue in-depth creation in modern times. Instead, others have stepped in to take over, collecting remnants overseas, indulging in ancient times, and lamenting that Egypt and Greece have no successors. The pain of this situation is even greater. Now that the country is focusing on economic construction, it is not too late to remedy the situation. I offer my humble suggestions for selection and hope to work together with the people of the country to reverse the decline of art and elevate national culture to modern standards. This would be a great blessing.</p>

<p>The Sound of Anti-Japanese Resistance</p>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>The tyrannical Japanese are wreaking havoc, and the entire country is indignant. Many schools are training volunteer soldiers to prepare for the worst. Shooting practice is extremely important. My family originally had two large air rifles. They were often used for practice. Recently, my two sons were both assigned to the volunteer army at school. Every morning at home, they draw a red sun in the center of a white piece of paper in the courtyard as the target for shooting, symbolizing that every bullet is aimed at the Japanese flag. When volunteer armies practice shooting targets in various places, it is best to also draw a red sun as the target, to indicate the purpose of the shooting.</p>

<h3>Reading Lenin's Biography</h3>
<p>Fulep Müller's "Lenin and Gandhi" has the following passage regarding Lenin's education policy:</p>
<p>"…His education was intended to prevent people from exceeding the knowledge and education permitted by the government of the day. In this way, the people in the proletarian state would not be stirred by too much knowledge and the danger of reflection. Lenin, on the one hand, attacked illiteracy, and on the other hand, suppressed free science…" Lenin was unwilling to allow the people freedom to seek knowledge. Only air and knowledge should be unrestricted by people. After reading this passage, I could not help but protest. I wrote a few lines of indignation at the time, and now I will publish them:</p>
<p>"The people's ignorance cannot be used, loudly awakening the deaf; fearing difficulty in controlling them when enlightened, suddenly wanting to shut their ears. Like a country relative, wanting to send gifts and also being jealous."</p>
<h3>Guangbing is a Supplement for Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>Almost everyone has eaten Guangbing sold in the market, but few people know why this cake is named "Guang." In these days of anti-Japanese fervor, it is especially important to study it. It will surely invigorate your spirit. Originally, Guangbing was made by Qi Jiguang, a Ming Dynasty general. General Qi's name was Guang, so the cake was named Guangbing. Qi Jiguang was a great man in China's history of resisting Japanese pirates. In those days, the coastal areas of our country suffered from the poison of Japanese pirates. The misery was no less than the current situation in the three northeastern provinces. At that time, the government troops also dared not resist. Fortunately, this respectable and lovable Qi Jiguang was born, winning much glory and achieving many military exploits for our country. After he sent troops, he beat the Japanese pirates into a rout, fleeing at the sight of him. There was absolutely no word "non-resistance" in his mind. He treated the Japanese pirates like killing pigs. He was strict, brave, and admirable in his military actions. At that time, the Japanese were so afraid of the name of General Qi that even children dared not cry. He was only concerned that the soldiers would be hungry after prolonged battles, reducing their strength to kill the enemy. He specially came up with this convenient Guangbing. Each soldier could carry it with him. It was also easy to eat. When the soldiers were happy to fight, they could eat while killing. Eating and killing at the same time, killing them all. Once, a large group of Japanese pirates even killed up to Beiling, forty miles away from the provincial capital of Fuzhou. The situation was extremely critical. Duke Qi commanded his troops to resist, ordering his son to be the vanguard. He ordered the soldiers not to look back. Those who violated the order would be beheaded. After the army left the east gate, his son turned back to see if his father had left the city gate. Duke Qi saw it and immediately ordered him to be beheaded. Therefore, his soldiers bravely charged forward, each one worth ten men. After winning the victory, when they returned to the place where his son was killed, he thought of his son and built a pavilion on the spot, called the Son-Thinking Pavilion. It still exists today. Everyone, think about whether this Duke Qi is worthy of being a Chinese soldier. When you eat Guangbing, you should think of Duke Qi and learn from his loyalty and bravery. Quickly take back the three northeastern provinces and become today's Duke Qi.</p>
<h3>World Small Chronicle</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Canada's War Memorial. Canada has recently built a national war memorial. It is expected to be completed by the end of this year. It costs about 50,000 pounds. All the work is undertaken by a British family. This family can be called an artistic family because six brothers and one sister in the family can all work on it. It has been working since 1926, which shows the scale of the project.</p>
<p>Spanish Love Work. There is a province in Spain called Barcelona, which can be said to be a free land. In one place that is not free, if women fall in love with men, they cannot act alone. They can only talk about love in front of a female guardian. It is impossible to make intimate and sweet expressions. Even kissing must wait until after the engagement before it can be implemented. Young people generally think it is a great suffering.</p>
<p>Politicians and Detective Novels Detective novels are intriguing and interesting, and can develop the mind. Therefore, many people around the world love to read them. The great modern British politician and former Prime Minister Lloyd George and S. Baldwin are both avid readers of detective novels. In their spare time, they use detective novels to relax.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Four Hours of Reflections</h3>
<p>— Yang Jifu</p>
<p>Last year, I made a brief tour of the Northeast in early spring. Everything I saw and heard was heartbreaking. Entering the customs, I visited Nankai University in Tianjin and met Mr. Zhang Boling (at that time, Mr. Zhang had just returned from Japan after the failure of the Chinese delegation to the Far Eastern Games). Mr. Zhang asked: "You came from Liaodong. What are your thoughts?" I said: "I certainly have thoughts, but I feel that I don't know where to start. What I saw on this trip was that the economy of the Northeast was completely under the control of the Japanese. The Japanese no longer need to add political and military aggression. Like the furniture in the house and the gold and silver treasures in the boxes and chests, everything has been taken by them. What is the need for sweeping? The political affairs of the Northeast are exactly like this. If the Japanese want to annex and seize it, it is tantamount to asking for trouble. However, the destruction of the Northeast will only take twenty-four hours." Mr. Zhang said angrily: "It is not just the Northeast that is like this. China can be destroyed in twenty-four hours. Open your eyes and see if there is any defense at the ports of the country. Now Japan has occupied the Northeast in twenty-four hours. Alas, my words have unfortunately come true. I only hope that Mr. Zhang's words will be fortunate enough not to come true." (Transferring Donations to Relief)</p>
<h3>Prophetic Sounds</h3>
<p>— Red Ice Child</p>
<p>Prophecies are sayings. Honorable people do not esteem them, but how can those who perished be at peace? The one who revives the Han is named 'Show'. When Tu is high, the Cao Wei dynasty will flourish. A quick pill signals the demise of the Manchu Qing. Nursery rhymes and folk sayings unintentionally come true after the event. Is this not what Zhuangzi meant when he said, "The Dao is in the urine and excrement"? Here are four examples selected and recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Eastern carriages and horses are commonly seen and ridden by people on the roads. Now, they recklessly incite conflict and seek trouble for no reason. They take advantage of our natural disasters and add troops to our borders. They are utterly barbaric and without principle. Is it not the East wrong? (Homophone) Could it be China that is wrong?</p>
<p>"Doing a thousand, doing ten thousand, but not doing a business that loses money" is a common saying in the business world. To resist the uncivilized and unreasonable Japanese barbarians, boycott enemy goods, and sever economic ties is the supreme strategy for national survival. "Don't do business with Japan" (Homophone). Our merchants have long foreseen this.</p>
<p>"There is sky, but no sun," is also a folk saying. In essence, the old name of Liaoning and Shenyang was Fengtian. If we want to recover the Fengtian homeland, we must prevent the Japanese from rising to prominence. Only then can our territory be complete and intact.</p>
<h3>Mr. Liu Haisu's Reflections on His European Art Study Tour (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>"Spiritual Resonance and Lifelike Dynamism" is a very difficult concept to explain, yet it is extremely important. These four characters can be broken down and explained one by one from "Spiritual Resonance," "Resonance," "Lifelike," and "Dynamism." They can also be sharply divided into two segments and explained separately from "Spiritual Resonance" and "Lifelike Dynamism." Alternatively, "Spiritual Resonance and Lifelike Dynamism" can be interpreted as a single noun.</p>
<p>"Spiritual Resonance and Lifelike Dynamism" has recently become a single, indivisible term in the Chinese art world. At most, people say it contains "lifelike dynamism with spiritual resonance" or "lifelike dynamism permeated with spiritual resonance." In reality, lifelike dynamism in the universe is invariably permeated with spiritual resonance. Spiritual resonance is bound to be expressed through lifelike dynamism. If we were to replace it with a foreign term, as in the aforementioned five methods, we could readily use the word "Rhythm." The English critic Walter Pater said in his famous work "The Renaissance," "All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music." Therefore, rhythm is not only the state of music but also a state inherent in all art. Understanding this point will make it easier to comprehend the significance of spiritual resonance and lifelike dynamism. As I mentioned above, spiritual resonance and lifelike dynamism are, on the one hand, the ultimate completion of Chinese painting creation, and on the other hand, the highest criterion for criticism. Xie He meant exactly this in the past. In the first aspect, creation can achieve spiritual resonance and lifelike dynamism because it has the primary condition of "brushwork." What has been discussed above is very clear. In fact, it can also achieve spiritual resonance and lifelike dynamism, for example, "the subtlety of distinct styles is also entering the realm of divine." However, writing without losing brushwork is the best. This has also been discussed above. As for structure and imitation, they also rely on brushwork to highlight their characteristics. Then brushwork is very important and mysterious in Chinese painting. Yes, Xie He also regarded brushwork as innate, saying, "Heavenly talent and innate knowledge cannot be attained through learning." At the very least, there must be "overflowing intention and novel brushstrokes." We can regard the overflowing intention as the arrival of inspiration. The painter's creation is not like a machine that runs every day. He can only put pen to paper when he has the inspiration to inspire, at least when he is content and joyful, or even when he finds joy in sorrow. He described Gu Junzhi's creative situation as follows: "He once built a multi-story building as a place for painting. He would not pick up a brush during windy, rainy, or hot weather. Only on days when the weather was mild and the air was refreshing would he take up a brush, ascend to the building, and remove the ladder. His wife and children rarely saw him." Gu Junzhi was like this. There must also be someone who does the opposite and starts writing in windy, rainy, or hot weather. Therefore, the achievement of spiritual resonance and lifelike dynamism in creation is actually mostly a component of genius.</p>
<p>"Old days don't make good dramas" This proverb means that vulgar people should not be associated with for long. Using the enslaved Koreans to cruelly massacre overseas Chinese is a trick that is not a good drama. A good drama, the audience shouts with praise. It is pitiful that the Koreans are only doing puppet show, really a puppet play. I know, in the world stage, this play is destined to not win applause.</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. Shou Juan states that at a Ningbo fellow-villagers association gathering, the two ladies Yu and Tang initiated a painting exhibition for flood victims from various provinces. There, he saw a painting "Autumn Scenery on a Balance" by Mr. Chen Xiaodie, signed "Dieye." The excellent coloring and imagery made it unforgettable. Regrettably, paintings were purchased by ticket number, preventing arbitrary selection. He does not know whose hands this pearl has fallen into. I deeply admire this painting and wish to purchase it at a high price. I wonder if you, sir, could disclose this information. If the owner is willing to part with it, please send a letter to the "Freedom Talk" section of your newspaper, entrusted to Mr. Shou Juan for delivery. I would be immensely grateful. With best wishes, respectfully, Tuian. Shou Juan's note: My friend Xiaodie's paintings are elegant and free. Those signed "Dieye" are his carefully crafted works. He cherishes his reputation and will not part with even one painting for any amount of money. Even in ordinary exhibitions, his works are rarely seen. Recently, he has made a grand vow for the flood victims in various provinces. He is collaborating with Qian Shoutie on Buddhist images, each priced at thirty yuan, with a quota of one hundred pieces, all proceeds donated to relief efforts. I heard that more than half have already been purchased. However, I also deeply admire Dieye's landscapes. After more than ten years of close friendship, I only obtained a "Violet An Diagram." Since Dieye has made a grand vow, I hope that in addition to Buddhist images, he will create several landscapes for a solo exhibition, with all the proceeds donated to relief. Wouldn't that be an even greater act of merit? Anyone who agrees with my words, I am willing to take the lead in initiating this, and I ask Tuian what he thinks.</p>

<h3>The Pestle of Dreams (20)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Mr. Tao Chi advocated armed peace. After hearing these songs, he no longer insisted on his usual views. He leaned against a tree, nodding his head, tapping his toes, appreciating and murmuring to himself...</p>
<p>"That's right, in this era of great justice, China will not be subjugated. People are born to seek happiness, not to seek troubles for themselves. I am truly prone to excessive worry." "Tao, friend, are you here!" A singing girl greeted him from afar.</p>
<p>"Here! Come, come, come!" Many singing girls echoed the greeting.</p>
<p>"Coming! Coming!" Tao Chi could not help but step forward to meet them.</p>
<p>"May I ask your name, ladies?"</p>
<p>"We sing in the modern paradise, and we are all called modern singing girls."</p>
<p>"May I ask how old you are, ladies?"</p>
<p>"My age is sixteen, her age is also sixteen, and all their ages are sixteen. Moreover, this year is sixteen, and next year will also be sixteen, and the year after that will always be sixteen."</p>
<p>Tao Chi listened to these words, seeming to understand yet not understanding. He left the singing girls and continued forward, vaguely walking into a restaurant. Inside, many young men and women were holding a modern dinner party and invited Tao Chi to join them, simply because there was an empty seat at the party.</p>
<p>"May I ask, gentlemen, what is the occasion for this dinner party today?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Tao, we do not use the word 'today.' With today, there is the past yesterday and the future tomorrow. We have none of those here, only the enduring present."</p>
<p>"Is this place perpetual daylight?"</p>
<p>"We only live forever under the all-encompassing morning light, with no end or night... With day and night,"</p>
<p>"We cannot maintain our present. We are overthrowing day and night."</p>

<h3>Gold Market Continues to Soar</h3>
<p>Another Increase of Ten Taels and Seven Mace Yesterday's gold price continued to show sharpness, almost taking off, with five or six taels of twists and turns. The storms and turbulence were unpredictable, and there was a difference of fourteen taels throughout the day. As a result, the clear increase was beyond ten taels, which was due to the general shorts being eager to cover. The opening was weak, probably due to the slight drop in silver prices. Afterwards, the buyers were excited, and they rushed out of the 710 taels, and the exchange rate tended to be tight. However, the market lacked market on Wednesday, but the buying in the market was still very excited. Therefore, the market was particularly sharp, and Erzhang was 719 taels. The situation was extraordinarily firm.</p>
<p>The Morning Trend Was From Low to High It fell 1.7 mace at the opening of the morning, for 706 taels, and then 0.58 taels, which meant that the big strip fell one-half, and the silver price only fell one-quarter, so it did not rise. However, Yuan Mao Yongda Xing Yong Tong Taichang Yuhe and shorts tended to buy in, and immediately rose five or six taels, and the moment asked reached twelve taels, and then it fell back. Because Zhengjin sold the January US gold at 32.125 yuan, and the British gold was 17625, and Hengchang Yong Qian Changxiang Zhifeng Yongcui Chang Yong and other players came on the scene to sell. Therefore, it was less than five taels. When the British gold was opened at 0.65 taels, the listing price dropped 375, and the US gold only fell by half a yuan, so the gold price only increased by 1 taels, which was 0.82 taels. However, zero households and others sold, and it was suppressed to 0.5 taels. In a moment, it gradually looked up. Yuan Mao Yongda Decheng Hongkang Yong Yuan Tai Daxing Yong Wu and Shunli Wanxing and other companies scrambled to buy, and the US gold was more prosperous. The bank absorbed 31.875 yuan, and the British gold was only 17375. The market was unparalleled, and it went straight up to the sky, and it soared by nine taels, and at 10:30 it was fourteen taels. After entering, Zhifeng Yongda Kang and foreign exchange hedgers took the opportunity to sell, and fell more than five taels. At 11:00, it was 0.85 taels, and then Yifeng Richang Yucheng Yong and other efforts to compete and zero households and shorts were engaged in a rush, so the US gold was only settled at 31.75 yuan, and the British gold was 17.375 yuan, so the price soared by six or seven taels, and at noon it reached 15.2 mace. The market closed at 14.8 mace. Tong Taichang sold out, and the foreign businessman Joe Joseph also came out, and then it was made to 14 taels. However, retail investors were still buying in, and it was re-seen at 16 taels. The asking price was more than 760 taels, and the total was about 50 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Was Thriving The opening price of the market was 16.5 mace, followed by 17 taels, which was the remaining wind after the noon closing. It was also heard that the Indian exchange rate had fallen slightly by 6 anna. However, Guangbang Yifeng and others sold out, and the price immediately rose to 13.8 mace. At 2:30, it was sharp, but there was a 1.2 taels head, and the price was around 15 taels. After 3 o'clock, the rising trend intensified, and Dalian Bang and Tong Taichang Yuan Mao Yong Heng Yu Zhifeng Yong Wu and others took the plunge. It was also heard that the Indian exchange rate was 4 anna small, and it was also rumored that the London International Bank planned to maintain the pound price and not to be tired, so the morale was more firm, and the price soared more than 4 taels. At 3:50, it reached 718.8 mace. At 4:00, Da Decheng Qian Changxiang and others slightly came out, so they had already sharply fallen by 1.2 taels, which was 17.2 mace. After that, there was a little bit of 1 taels, and the market closed at 4:30, still at a high peak, which was 718.4 mace, which was 10.7 mace higher than the previous day. According to the maximum of 18.8 mace and the minimum of 0.5 mace in one day, the difference was 13.8 mace. The morning market was 0.5 mace, the noon closing was 14.5 rain, the afternoon was 17 taels, and the closing price was 18 taels.

<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all fell, but the exchange rate between the United Kingdom and the United States rose, probably due to the tightening of the British exchange rate in Shanghai.

The rest have changed, but Hong Kong has not moved and is still listed at 78 taels.

<h3>The Intensifying Silver Tightness Panic</h3>
<p>Market Overview The current month's silver tightness was originally secretly fluctuating and inconvenient to fully reveal. The inside story is also afraid of affecting the future of the financial industry. In the past, half a month's observation has been rising and falling, and it is still possible to hold on strong patience. Suddenly, in the second half of the month, another special and irreversible crisis occurred. The silver is tightening step by step, and the situation is getting more and more dangerous. Yesterday, the bank's drawing head of water increased to 5 mace, setting a new record for this year. This emergency is not a blessing for the financial industry, but also a hidden worry for the entire Shanghai business market.</p>
<p>Libor Prices The "foreign libor" morning market seemed to be stronger than the previous day, and the closing price was 7 qian 2 fen 8 li. The afternoon market was slightly smaller than 2 haos and a half, which was 7 qian 2 fen 7 li 7 haos and a half. As a result, it was half a li higher than the previous day's afternoon market, and the situation did not have a bad impression. The "silver breakdown" is becoming more and more dangerous, and the early morning silver breakdown opened at 3 qian 5 fen, which is still suitable. It is comparable to the previous noon, and although people are tight, they cannot avoid the horror scene. Suddenly, the afternoon market rose again by 7 points to 4 qian 2 fen. The head drawing of water was even more surprisingly high, and it reached a high of 4 qian 9 fen and 5 qian. The general lack of silver is helpless, and the description of the severity of the situation is difficult to describe. The bank's listing price also increased to 1 qian 4 fen due to the increase in the silver breakdown.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market The Jiangnan small foreign market was 6 qian 5 fen 8 li in the morning market, and 6 qian 5 fen 7 li in the afternoon market. As a result, it was 1 li 7 hao and a half smaller than the previous day. The transaction was 3,000 corners in the morning market and 2,000 corners in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign market was 6 qian 5 fen 5 li and a half in the morning market, and 6 qian 5 fen 5 li 1 hao 2 huns in the afternoon market. It was about 1 li smaller than the previous day's afternoon market. The transaction was 135,000 corners in the morning market and 50,000 corners in the afternoon market. The copper coins were still 377,500 wen, and the transaction was more than 32,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar In and Out "Silver Money" Yesterday, the bank received and delivered news that due to the tight silver and the commercial depression, the receiving and delivery procedures were simpler than usual. Chinese merchants received and delivered about 1.78 million, foreign merchants received and delivered about 1.2 million, various cargo exchange tax miscellaneous items received and delivered 6.89 million, and other special items and mortgage transactions were slightly heard, but the amount was limited and omitted. 900,000 were put into storage, 52 million were received and delivered by Qianzhuang Yin Gongdan, 3.3 million were received and delivered by Hua Tou, and 500,000 were received and delivered by various remittances. "Foreign Money" Huahua Piao received and delivered 975,000 in the early market, and 1.745 million in the afternoon market. 110,000 in the early market for banknotes, 30,000 in the afternoon market, 145,000 in the early market for banknotes outside the market, 60,000 in the afternoon market, 500,000 for interbank interbank trading in the early market, 650,000 for interbank interbank trading in the afternoon market, more than 1.1 million for interbank foreign account transactions, more than 2 million for banknotes in and out, 5.1 million for Qianzhuang Yang Gongdan, 1.8 million for Yang Hua Tou, 1.7 million for dismantling and borrowing foreign money, and only 300,000 to 400,000 for small Qianzhuang transactions and remittances.</p>
<h3>Security and Bond Prices Slightly Higher Than Before</h3>
<p>The trend is very peaceful and the ups and downs are slight</p>
<p>The market situation is still good, and the future transactions are more than 9.7 million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market situation of various bonds in the Securities Exchange. Although there were many kinds of spot trading, the transaction was very small. The total transaction for the whole day was only 9,000 yuan. The futures market for October was the same as before, and the arbitrage trading was very strong. The November futures market was more lively. The transaction in the morning was more than 6.3 million, and the transaction in the afternoon was 3.35 million. The total was about 9.7 million yuan. Among them, the most popular was the unified tax, accounting for more than 2.5 million, and the 20% tariff was about 2 million yuan. Although there was no new development in the diplomatic situation, the domestic peace and reunification problem was very optimistic. The bond market environment was generally very good, but the silver money industry was tight, and large investors did not have huge investments. The popularity of buyers was rarely improved. The market was still dominated by zero households and arbitrage. Therefore, although the market prices of various bonds were generally higher than the previous day, the trend was very stable. The old short households were not willing to make up for the settlement, and they were ready to deliver goods at the end of the month. The long side was in danger of being squeezed by those who could not receive the goods. Therefore, although the buyers had a slight advantage, the overall situation of supply and demand was very balanced. The front and back markets were always trapped in a hovering state, and the stagnant situation was unseen for several weeks. As a result, the futures for the next month, such as the 20% tariff, rose by more than 1 yuan, and other multi-good rose by several corners, but the establishment of the whole 6 continued to fall slightly, and the spot for the 20% tariff fell quite a lot compared with the beginning of the week.</p>

<h3>The Yarn Flower and Yarn Market are Calm</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, the general trend is not detached from the hovering, the people's hearts are calm, the actual sales in the market, although there is no large amount of transactions, but the retail of various gangs, the business has not been exhausted, and the bottom goods of each factory are lacking, so the market is relatively stable, and the rise and fall are between three and four taels.</p>
<p>The Human Mark is Slightly More Charming The opening of the Human Mark's pre-market, because there are not many sellers in the market, the market atmosphere is still flat, and the months have risen by 2.4.7.8.9 qian. In the afternoon, it was flat and tired, and each fell by 3.4.5 qian. According to statistics, 15,700 Dan checked out 1,400 packages from Jia Chuyi, 650 packages from Gengfeng, 400 packages from Shenji, and 400 packages from Yiyu. Changji bought 950 packages, Tianlong 400 packages, and Dachang 400 packages. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Human Mark Closing Price Account Number Human Mark Closing Price Account Number</p>

Among the visiting gangs, 175 packages were entered by the inland, 200 packages were entered by Jiangxi, 35 packages were entered by Hankou, 65 packages were entered by Guangdong, and 150 packages were entered by miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>Continued Progress in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>American cotton has shown a tendency towards weakness, but gold prices are slightly stronger, and two major firms have purchased a particularly large amount of bales, approximately over 20,000 dan (a unit of weight), resulting in almost all available cotton being bought up and a tighter market atmosphere. However, actual cotton transactions in the market remain non-existent, with no inquiries being made, due to prices being too high while foreign cotton remains cheaper. Forward contract factories are still selling, and the future trend will continue to depend on the direction of American cotton.</p>
<p>Hankou futures continue to rise. The opening price of Hankou standard cotton futures was affected by the falling trend of American cotton, causing scattered small investors to become soft and hesitant. However, two major buyers purchased, leading to an increase of 2-3 qian (a unit of currency). The afternoon opening was flat, but the closing was strong. The total trading volume was 113,900 dan. It has been found that Tianlong sold 3,000 dan, Changji 5,400 dan, Shenchang 3,000 dan, Ruiyuan 3,000 dan, Hengfeng 2,000 dan, and Changhe 2,100 dan. Hengde bought 13,200 dan, Dachang 9,700 dan, Gengfeng 3,500 dan, and Taichang 3,600 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>American Cotton Falls Back, British Cotton Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to heavy buying by major firms, but later weakened due to reactionary selling and short selling in the South. Futures fell by 8-15 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 14 points, and spot prices rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 20th).</p>

<h3>The Situation in the Grain and Riverine Rice Market is Slightly Stronger</h3>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday's rice market saw few sources from the western routes. Transactions in the city were more active than before, and it was rumored that Zhabei was increasing purchases. Various shops took advantage of this opportunity to buy more inventory. New japonica polished rice of two grades saw prices increase by 12 jiao (a unit of currency). The Bai Ge Yao variety was still selling sporadically. The Ningbo variety was somewhat popular in the local market, with prices rising by 1 jiao. Transactions for fresh and aged Lu Yang Tip rice were sluggish, and the market remained flat. Fluctuations in the exchange rate were limited. Water chestnut tips have already dropped to zero.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday's arrivals were about 20-30 boats. Due to the sharp drop in prices in the previous few days, traders suffered losses. The prices in the inland areas initially followed the downward trend in the Shanghai market, but inquiries from buyers turned firm. Morning trading was excellent, with fresh and aged goods from Changzhou and Wuxi being the most popular, with prices rising by a few jiao. The Nanbang varieties, including medium-red rice and white rice, sold well. The market saw no rise or fall. The glutinous rice market was slightly tight. The Budu Tip variety was affected by foreign rice and showed a downward trend. New Kunshan japonica rice arrived briskly, but sales were sluggish with prices down 2-3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Trading is Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw no movement from the North gangs and a wait-and-see attitude from the local gangs. Overall trading was quiet, and the market gradually returned to a state of calm. Although foreign rice trading companies were selling, there were no inquiries from buyers. Moreover, the October shipments sold last month and at the end of September have already arrived in port one after another. Therefore, everyone's sentiment is bearish. Although the buyer gangs have an appetite, they are mostly waiting and seeing, waiting for prices to fall before taking action. The overall market only saw a small transaction of 100 bags by a local gang for a small profit of 10.04 yuan per bag.</p>
<h3>Futures Market is Generally Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a generally flat trend after the opening in the morning, with various market participants having their own positions. Because of the mixed influences of foreign wheat, the prices for various months' positions were stable with a slightly bullish undertone. By the afternoon opening, near-term positions remained stable due to tight money conditions, while long-term positions saw a sharp rise. Rumors that the contracted foreign wheat was involved in an accident at an American port, and that European countries such as France had also ordered 30-40 million bushels from the United States, led to predictions that the price of foreign wheat would soar. Therefore, market sentiment was excited, and prices peaked step by step. It remains to be seen whether there will be further positive developments. As a result, the current month rose by 7.5 li (a unit of currency), November to January rose by 2.5 fen (a unit of currency), February rose by 2.25 fen, and March rose by 2.75 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Jump Sharply in the Aftermarket</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw stable prices in the morning opening, with little increase, only 2 fen different from the previous day. However, at the afternoon opening, both near- and long-term contracts saw a sharp rise, and trading was unusually active. This was due to rumors that the contracted American wheat had been involved in an accident, and that France had ordered a large quantity of American wheat. By extrapolation, the source of foreign wheat was expected to be restricted, causing dormant market sentiment to suddenly rise sharply. The difference between the high and low prices compared to the previous day reached 1-2 qian, and if this rumor is confirmed, there may be another wave of excitement. As a result, the current month rose by 8 fen compared to the previous day, November rose by 1 qian, December rose by 9 fen, and January to March each rose by 1.2 qian.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Factories Continue to See No Improvement in European Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai remained unchanged. Reports from Lyon indicated that sales of Shanghai white filature silk were not improving and that French sales were still stagnating. Although American firms were negotiating for spot and futures, their bids were still demanding, and various manufacturers found it difficult to accept due to heavy costs and small profits resulting in large losses. Yesterday, only Hexing purchased 10 bales of medium-to-superior Shanghai white filature silk. Weicheng purchased 10 bales of Hubei cocoon Shanghai yellow filature silk, and Gaobei and others purchased 15 bales of coarse yellow silk. Prices remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Jili Raw Silk Continues to be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Over 200 Pieces Transported from Xun and Zhen Ports Yesterday</p>
<p>Recently, sales of Jili raw silk to Europe and the United States have been sluggish, and inventories of new silk in the producing areas have increased sharply, leading to increased shipments. Yesterday, Jili raw silk continued to be shipped to Shanghai from Xun and Zhen ports, with 220 pieces of Xiu, Lin, Qing, and Ma brand silks being transported by Mei Hengyu and others. They are now in warehouses awaiting sale.</p>
<h3>Zhen Mei Green Tea Shows Slight Movement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai remained quiet. Although Jinlong, Dode, and other firms made small purchases of Zhen Mei, Gong Xi, and Zhu tea, these were only to replenish stock and not for large-scale demand. The long-stagnant Zhen Mei green tea saw the British firm Jardine Matheson issue a large number of pricing telegrams, and the market has shown slight movement. However, the proposed market prices are more than 20 taels (a unit of weight) lower than before, so it is difficult to be optimistic about the situation.</p>
<h3>Needle and Xiu Mei Teas See Slight Movement in British Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai saw British firms such as Yuansheng and Fushi starting to purchase green teas such as Needle and Xiu Mei from local tea merchants, and the market showed slight activity. However, due to long-term sluggish sales, market prices are 5-6 taels lower. (Xi green tea, Baitou firms Qichang, Ruichang, and Yulong bought over 400 chests. Market prices were unchanged from the previous few days. Only local firms traded small amounts of Zhen Mei. High-grade teas remained stagnant.)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Sleeve Linings, Printed Cotton Fabrics Sell Well</h3>
<p>The current woolen fabric market can be described as stable, but it is a pity that the exchange rate for shillings has increased significantly, and it is predicted that market prices next spring will be extremely chaotic. Yesterday, horsehair sleeve linings and printed cotton fabrics sold extremely well, and foreign firms were busy shipping goods. Local buyer gangs had strong demand, especially Western-style clothing shops. Deji and Gongping jointly sold foreign cotton fabrics at 1.5 yuan per yard, Tianfeng and Yongle at 4.9 fen, and horsehair sleeve linings of various brands were sold at 4.85-5 fen. Authentic goods were out of stock, and prices rose sharply by several fen per yard compared to last week. Yesterday, Tahe's wholesale price was 1.125 yuan per yard, and the retail price from shops was 1.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Navy Blue Melton Sells Well and Rebounds</h3>
<p>Melton cloth is currently selling well, and local buyer gangs continue to purchase it. Most of it is used for Western-style clothing and overcoats. Prices once fell due to abundant inventory and sluggish sales. Yesterday, prices rebounded, with navy blue being particularly popular, rising sharply by several fen per yard. Only navy blue and yuan-colored Melton cloth are available. Yuan-colored cloth is sold to the Sichuan gangs, and navy blue is sold to local and Zhejiang inland small buyer gangs. The Sichuan gangs completed their purchases a month ago, and the local gangs are currently slowly making purchases.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>New Lead Wire Sales Reached 600-700 Dan Yesterday</p>
<p>Metal trading saw significantly reduced sales in the northern routes due to the war, while sales in the south were limited due to tight money conditions. Therefore, the overall market trend was quiet. However, the long-dormant new lead wire saw sales of 600-700 dan yesterday, with prices ranging from 13.25 taels per dan for sizes 16-20, and 18.75 taels for sizes 21-25. Coarse grades were priced from 9-11 taels.</p>
<h3>Coal</h3>
<p>Hongqi Coal Has Ample Inventory</p>
<p>Recent arrivals of Hongqi white coal have been strong, and inventory is ample. Surveys of various warehouses show current stocks of over 7,000 tons. Sales are not particularly active due to seasonal factors. High-quality screened lump coal is priced at 22 taels per ton, while the smaller cinders screened out sell extremely well, as demand has increased from sand-spreading, laundry work, and small factories. Therefore, prices are also very firm, currently selling at 17.5 taels per ton.</p>

They then gathered with central committee members remaining in Shanghai to discuss everything. Chairman Jiang is scheduled to come to Shanghai in the next few days to meet. It has been decided that the peace and unification conference will be held in Nanjing, with only an exchange of ideas taking place in Shanghai. Wang and others expressed to people yesterday that party comrades should unite sincerely and have high hopes for the future of the peace conference. Here is a summary of the details of yesterday's arrival in Shanghai and the statements of the Guangdong representatives.</p>
<h3>Shantou Encountered a Storm</h3>
<p>The President Madison of the Da Lai Company was originally scheduled to arrive the morning before yesterday, but due to encountering a severe hurricane and dangerous waves in Shantou, it was forced to reduce its speed. Therefore, it was delayed until 8:30 am yesterday morning to enter the Wusongkou and arrived at the Bund at 10:00 am, berthing at the No. 16 and 17 floating pontoon wharves in Yangshupu, arriving 24 hours late.</p>
<h3>Welcoming the Representatives</h3>

<h3>Martial Law on the Bund</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Bund area in Yangshupu was under martial law. In addition to the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatching a special water patrol team for strict defense, port police from the Customs House went to protect the area.

<h3>Boarding the Ship to Welcome the Representatives</h3>
<p>The President Madison berthed at the Bund at 10:00 am yesterday morning, and the welcoming personnel boarded the ship one after another to greet them. For a time, the deck was noisy with voices. Wang, Sun, Li, Wu, Chen, and others shook hands with the welcomers in the hall. Wang was dressed in Western-style clothes and his attitude remained the same. At 10:30 am, Wang and the others disembarked and boarded the Public Security Bureau's ferry. At 11:10 am, they landed at the Taikoo Wharf. Those waiting there held banners and cheered.

<h3>Joint Statement</h3>
<p>The Guangzhou Extraordinary Conference sent Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Sun Ke, Mr. Li Wenfan, Mr. Wu Chaoshu, Mr. Chen Youren, and others to Shanghai to discuss peaceful unification matters. Wang and the others arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 21st aboard the President Madison. In the midst of the enthusiastic welcome from all sectors, the reporter stepped forward to ask about the purpose of this trip. The gentlemen made a brief statement, which is excerpted below: (1) The reporter asked, "What is the purpose of this trip?" They replied, "Since its establishment, the Central Extraordinary Conference has aimed internally to establish democratic politics and overthrow personal dictatorship, and externally to thoroughly defeat the aggressors of imperialism and seek China's absolute freedom and equality. However, our method of resolving the current situation differs greatly from those who purely seek victory by force. We believe that unification can only be achieved through construction, and joint governance can only be achieved through power-sharing. For months, colleagues at the Extraordinary Conference have been working hard to achieve the above goals. Unexpectedly, Japanese imperialists suddenly sent troops to forcibly occupy the three northeastern provinces, massacring countless of our compatriots, destroying countless of our properties, trampling on our sovereignty, and humiliating our nation to the utmost. Anyone with blood in their veins cannot tolerate this. This time, colleagues were ordered by the Extraordinary Conference to come to Shanghai to discuss peaceful unification, with the aim of completing our consistent advocacy, concentrating the power of the whole country, striving internally for the realization of democratic politics, and externally planning to jointly deal with the national crisis, vowing to resolve the current diplomatic difficulties in our country on the principle of not losing a single inch of our country's territory or sovereignty. Not losing power and not humiliating the country is our consistent external spirit, and it is also the basis of the Nationalist Party's glorious history in the past." (2) The reporter asked, "Can we hear about the process of promoting unification in Shanghai this time?" They replied, "The disputes within the Party and the country in recent years have been extremely painful, but they have also been unavoidable. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the Extraordinary Conference, we announced to the people of the country the spirit of seeking service without competing for victory. Fortunately, the two sides have confronted each other for months and have not met in battle, which is also a great fortune in misfortune. Since the Japanese troops forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces, Cai Jiemin</p>
<h3>The Grand Welcome from the People (Taken by Liguang Studio)</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Puquan and Mr. Chen Zhenru were ordered to go south and brought a handwritten letter from Mr. Chiang Kai-shek expressing his sincerity in seeking unification of the country and jointly dealing with the national crisis. We immediately invited the three gentlemen to Guangzhou and proposed that the Guangdong government issue a circular telegram agreeing with Chiang's resignation and the cancellation of the Guangdong government produced by the unification conference in order to establish a unified government. The three gentlemen expressed their approval and jointly drafted a telegram to be issued by Chiang, stating that he would resign after the establishment of a unified government, and to be issued by the Guangdong government, stating that the Guangdong government would cancel this decision after the establishment of a unified government. The telegram and draft were telegraphed to Chiang by Cai, Zhang, and Chen. Chiang replied that he agreed in principle, but the wording of the telegram had to be carefully revised before it could be issued, and asked the Guangdong side to send responsible comrades to Shanghai to discuss it. At the same time, we also learned that Mr. Hu Zhantang had safely arrived in Shanghai, so the Extraordinary Conference immediately passed a resolution at the 16th Congress to send colleagues and others to the north that day." (3) The reporter asked, "Do you have a pre-determined plan for resolving national affairs this time?" They replied, "Colleagues and others do not hold the idea of competing for victory, nor do we come for the purpose of dividing spoils. Therefore, even if there are pre-determined plans, they are nothing more than fundamental improvement methods concerning the party affairs, politics, military, diplomacy, finance, and other systems. The general idea has been seen in the Extraordinary Conference's circular telegram to the Maruichi on the current situation. Due to the short time, we regret that we cannot elaborate on the detailed plan."</p>
<h3>Meeting at the Hu Residence</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Li Wenfan, and Chen Youren, etc., disembarked at the Bund of the French Concession on the Great Horse Road at 11:00 am yesterday and took cars directly to the Hu residence on Muirhead Road to comfort Mr. Hu and discuss the grand plan for peaceful unification. Mr. Hu also kept everyone for lunch and had a pleasant conversation. Wang and Hu expressed their closeness when they met. Everyone talked straight until 1:15 pm before excusing themselves. Soon, Wang and Chen, etc., together with Sun Ke, took cars to Sun's residence at No. 10 Rue Moliere to continue the discussion. Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, and Li Shizeng also arrived one after another and held a tea party at the Sun residence to discuss peaceful unification. Zhang and Cai left at 3:00 pm first, and Chen and Wu also left at 4:30 pm one after another. Wang talked straight until 5:00 pm before leaving Sun's residence. There was news that the committees will hold another discussion at the Hu residence that evening. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the discussions among the committees at the Wu residence included (1) the committees agreed to first organize a unified diplomatic committee to unify diplomatic policies in order to deal with foreign affairs first (2) The various problems regarding party affairs, politics, and the military will be considered in detail after Chairman Jiang arrives in Shanghai. It will not be announced for the time being.</p>
<h3>Talks by Zhang and Cai</h3>
<p>Zhang Ji and Cai Yuanpei, who came with the Guangdong representatives, told reporters from this newspaper yesterday that comrades of the party, in view of the current national crisis, have resolved to be consistent in dealing with foreign affairs. There is no form of meeting in Shanghai, and external rumors of a preparatory meeting and other things are not facts. Chairman Jiang will come to Shanghai in the next few days to meet and exchange ideas again. After both parties agree, the Guangdong representatives will go to Nanjing for formal consultations. The parties are now concerned about not internal personnel disputes, but focus on consistency in dealing with foreign problems, and so on.</p>
<h3>Confucius Visits Wu</h3>
<p>Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>Visited Guangdong representative Wu Chaoshu at his private residence at around 3:00 pm yesterday to discuss diplomatic policy for a long time. Not long after, Li Liejun, Xu Qian, Cheng Qian, and others visited Sun Ke and then went to the Wu residence to meet with Wu. Wu Tiecheng also had another meeting until around 5:00 pm before excusing himself.</p>
<h3>Wu Chaoshu Talks</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Chaoshu received a reporter from this newspaper yesterday and said that in the face of the current national crisis, we must do our best to unite the strength of the whole country and deal with foreign affairs consistently. As for this peaceful unification, the Guangdong side will work hard to promote it. The unification conference is determined to be held in Nanjing. The parties will only exchange views in Shanghai. Regarding diplomatic negotiations with Japan, our country has asked the League of Nations to uphold justice, but the League of Nations does not have the strength to support it. Only economic power, and whether the countries can consistently comply, is also a problem. Therefore, it is actually difficult to prevent Japan's violence. Although the United States has</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>has the strength, it is very clear whether they are willing to risk sacrifice for us. Therefore, the final way is self-help. If diplomatic efforts reach the end of the road, of course, we will have to take self-defense measures. The reporter asked about the external advocates for restoring relations with Russia. What does Mr. Wu think? Wu replied that there is no problem in restoring relations with Russia. In fact, relations in the Northeast have already been restored. After restoring relations, prohibiting their propaganda is another matter, which has absolutely no impact. Even if relations are not restored, Soviet Russia's propaganda can still be carried out unhindered. Mr. Wu also released an interview with a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter yesterday (Q) How will military and political powers be divided in the future? (A) We have always advocated that military power should be under the control of the party and the government. (Q) Will the first, second, and third session committees attend the peace conference completely? (A) This is the case when discussing party-related issues. (Q) Then will the official meeting be a tripartite meeting of the party, government, and military? (A) This depends on the results of the exchange of views in Shanghai before we know.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Telegram</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Guangdong Extraordinary Conference telegraphed Zou Lu in Shanghai, asking him to be a representative at this meeting. In addition to Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Li Wenfan, and Chen Youren, etc. five people, there are already six people with the addition of Zou.</p>
<h3>Evening Meeting</h3>
<p>At 7:20 pm yesterday, Wu Chaoshu went to the Hu residence on Muirhead Road. After a brief talk, he left at 7:50 pm. Sun Ke, Chen Youren, and Fu Bingchang arrived at the Hu residence together in Sun's car. At 8:20 pm, Wang Jingwei and his wife Chen Bijun arrived in the same car. Soon, Wang's wife went out and went elsewhere with Gu Mengyu. Wang and Sun then had a conversation with Mr. Hu. At that time, Li Wenfan was also present. It only broke up at 9:30 pm. It was heard that Wang's proposition on the current national affairs was to first establish a diplomatic committee to take charge of negotiations with Japan and other negotiations to respond to the urgent needs.</p>
<h3>Lin Sen Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Lin Sen and the Fang representatives, a group of over 60 people, originally intended to come with Wang, etc., but all the cabins were booked. Therefore, they changed to the German Hengbao mail ship, which is scheduled to enter the port at 3:00 pm today. The ship will dock in Pudong. However, according to a certain gentleman from Guangdong, Lin is said to have arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 pm yesterday.</p>
<h3>Headquarters Prepares a Car</h3>
<p>Zhang Ji and Cai Yuanpei, along with Guangdong representative Wang Jingwei, etc., received a call from Chairman Jiang yesterday evening, asking the two gentlemen to go to Nanjing that night to discuss everything in person. Zhang and Cai received the call and immediately asked the railway bureau to add a sleeper car to accompany the night express train to Nanjing. However, according to news from the railway bureau last night, the Nanjing General Headquarters instructed the Xiaguan station to prepare a car to come to Shanghai last night. At the same time, Zhang and Cai also cancelled their trip to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Wang's New Residence</h3>
<p>After Wang Jingwei and his wife arrived in Shanghai, they heard that they had found a new residence at No. 1 New York Lane on Rue Massenet. However, the interior is not yet fully renovated. Therefore, Wang and his wife stayed at Chu Minyi's residence last night. They can probably move into the new house in another two or three days.</p>
<h3>Party Department Welcome</h3>
<p>According to Guomin She, the Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, and Li Wenfan arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Third and Seventh District Party Departments of this city, in addition to sending personnel to welcome them, also issued a telegram urging the convening of a peaceful unification conference.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Anti-Japanese Movement</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Holds Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association held its ninth Executive Committee meeting yesterday. Hu Shuhua was publicly elected as chairman, and Zhao Shusheng as recorder. The following are local cases: (1) Discussing the case of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, it was resolved to have the Investigation and Inspection Departments investigate and ascertain the inventory before further discussion. (2) Discussing how to handle the case of this association's committee member and secretary, Feng Yixian, accusing committee member Hou Dachun of embezzling donations, it was resolved to appoint Wang Pingnan, Li Cishan, Chen Yafu, Chu Huiseng, and Xie Fusheng as five committee members to investigate, with Wang Pingnan designated as the convener. A temporary Executive Committee meeting will be convened at 4:00 PM this Saturday to discuss it. During the investigation period, both parties should temporarily recuse themselves. (3) Staff members of the Inspection Department, such as Chen Ji, jointly submitted a resolution to prove that the facts were definitely not embezzled by Committee Member Hou, which was resolved to be handled together with the previous case. (4) It was proposed that the confiscated Japanese goods, raw starch, from Yuanlai Firm be immediately allocated to help the disaster victims. It was resolved to pass it. (5) All 3,346 bags of confiscated Japanese goods from Yuanlai Firm were allocated to disaster relief. Regarding how to reward the informant, it was resolved to publish a thank you in the newspaper. (6) The Da Mei Evening News's remarks are absurd and arbitrarily attack this association. It was resolved to send a letter of warning.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Unifies Inspection Rights</h3>
<p>All Circles Should Register Inspection Sections</p>
<p>Automatic Inspections May Be Rejected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued Public Notice No. 13 yesterday regarding the unification of the right to inspect Japanese goods throughout the city, stating: According to the resolution of the third Standing Committee meeting of this association, the Inspection Department of this association is the highest authority for inspecting Japanese goods throughout the city. If other circles set up special inspection sections, they may be allowed to register with the Inspection Department of this association to assist this association in handling matters. The Japanese goods seized must be reported to the Inspection Department of this association immediately for personnel to receive them. Furthermore, the fifth Executive Committee meeting resolved that the inspection of goods in stores should be handled by the association together with the inspection teams of the relevant trade associations. Currently, it is found that various circles often spontaneously conduct inspections of goods. Although the enthusiasm is commendable, the resulting malpractices can easily lead to impersonation and fraud. Loving the country is therefore misleading it. A special urgent notice is hereby issued, urging all circles to comply with the regulations. Furthermore, all companies, factories, and stores, except for trade associations, may inspect and seal the stores of their associations, but the disposal of Japanese goods should still be reported to this association for handling. In addition, regarding those who do not hold the triangular badge of this association and the staff certificate with a photo attached, all should be rejected when they come to inspect. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>Warning Against Publishing Donghui News</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association warned the Financial Daily yesterday for publishing Donghui news, in a letter stating: To the esteemed editor, according to a confidential report, since the incident in the eastern provinces, the entire nation is seething with anger. The fundamental way to resist Japan lies in severing economic relations. It is now heard that the Shanghai Financial Daily in this city is still extensively publishing Donghui exchange rates, which is a clear violation of economic severance. It is requested that your association stop it, etc. Upon receipt of the report, it was found that the newspaper's subscribers are all merchants. At a time when the violent Japanese are invading without end, all our countrymen should not only have the determination to resist Japan but also eradicate any pro-Japanese impression. The newspaper's publication of Donghui exchange rates is tantamount to propaganda for the enemy, enticing treacherous merchants to seek profits, and greatly deviates from the consensus of our countrymen to resist Japan. According to the aforementioned situation in the letter, a serious warning is hereby issued. It is hoped that you will refuse to publish it from this day forward, lest you be abandoned by the public. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Deliberately Provoke Trouble on Avenue Doumer</h3>
<p>Opening Fire with a Handgun, Wounding a Policeman</p>
<p>At 0:15 AM this morning, a car came from North Sichuan Road at the corner of Avenue Doumer and East Yokohama Road. It passed through East Avenue Doumer and drove towards West Avenue Doumer, then turned back to the intersection of East Yokohama Road and stopped next to a small house 30 meters away from the police post. The policeman saw the chauffeur running over, shouting in a panic, "The Japanese are hitting me!" At this time, five Japanese chased from behind. Without asking the reason, they surrounded the policeman. Three Japanese tried to snatch the policeman's gun. After a few minutes of confrontation, one of the Japanese fired a handgun, and the bullet hit the policeman's left back of the hand, piercing through the palm. For self-defense, the policeman drew his gun and fired back, passing through the right sleeve of the Japanese's coat and grazing the palm. The assailant Japanese fled. The policeman also returned to the Public Security Bureau and reported to the Sixth Team. At that time, it happened that Fifth District Inspector Gao, Chief Inspector Chen, and patrolmen passed by and were surrounded and beaten by another group of Japanese. After investigation, the car number, 12609 in the Concession's registration, belonged to the Zhongshan Motor Company on Zha Pu Road. The chauffeur's name was Lu Peiwang, and the injured policeman's name was Wang Changshun. The assailant Japanese were Matsumoto, Nishimura, and a Taiwanese man named Gao. After the incident, Japanese Marine Corps Adjutant Yasuda led the Marine Corps in cars to the scene. On the Public Security Bureau's side, Fifth District Chief Wang and Team Leader Sun led the police to maintain order. After a while, City Government staff member Chen and the head of the Dithaisiwei Road Patrol Room arrived and negotiated with Yasuda. As a result, Yasuda ordered the Marine Corps to withdraw. A Browning pistol shell casing was found at the scene, which was obvious evidence that the Japanese had fired the gun. The head of the patrol room took it away.</p>
<h3>Letter from the People of Jilin to American Investigators</h3>
<p>Relating the Miserable Situation of Being Oppressed by the Japanese Army, Every Word a Tear</p>
<p>Since the Japanese used force to occupy Liaoning and Jilin, it has attracted the attention of various governments. The United States government specially sent the Counselor of the US Embassy in Japan, together with the US Consul General in Harbin, to South Manchuria to investigate and find out the truth. When the two arrived in Jilin, some respected people in Jilin jointly sent a letter to the two investigators, detailing the actions of the Japanese army after occupying Jilin, asking them to pay attention. Now a friend from Jilin has copied and sent the letter to Shanghai, asking for it to be published. Therefore, it is translated and published below. Reading it will further reveal the general atrocities of the Japanese in the eastern provinces. The general idea of the original letter is as follows: "(Titles omitted) We are pleased to know that Your Excellencies have come to Jilin to investigate with the good intention of maintaining international peace. We express our welcome. We assume that Your Excellencies urgently desire to obtain accurate information regarding the current real situation here. Therefore, we dare to state the following facts for reference: (1) The reorganized Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, Xi Qia, is under the strict surveillance of the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Jilin. Two Japanese military police guard his side day and night. All his words and actions are completely devoid of freedom, and he must obey the orders of the Japanese army commander in everything. Therefore, all political and financial affairs in Jilin Province are now actually under the control of the Japanese army. (2) On September 25, the Jilin Provincial Government held a reorganization under the threat of Japanese bayonets. Everything was directed by the Japanese army. Before the reorganization, two Japanese soldiers sent by the Japanese consulate pointed guns at Xi Qia, making him unable to resist, and this lasted for more than an hour. (3) All police in the provincial capital are completely under Japanese command. (4) All actions of the Japanese army are carried out at night in order to avoid public attention. (5) The following places are where the Japanese army is stationed: (1) the Provincial Government, (2) Dong Daying, (3) the Military Training School (translated name), (4) the headquarters of the 34th Regiment. In addition, the Japanese military police have also set up a command post at Erdao Wharf (translated name). (6) Since June 3, the Japanese army has been building a military airfield four or five li from Gaogang Road Station, and digging trenches near the station. (7) All railway stations, telegraph offices, radio telegraph offices, etc. in Jilin are managed by the Japanese army, and they inspect local newspapers, mail, and all official documents of the provincial government. (8) Pedestrians passing through Xinkai Gate after 7:00 PM are all subject to Japanese inspection. (9) The Japanese army arbitrarily searches without reason. There have been incidents of robbery of women's gold jewelry in Chinese residences from Jichang Railway Station to Xinkai Gate. (10) The Japanese army frequently breaks into schools to search students and teachers. If they find books containing the Three People's Principles, they will arrest them. (11) On September 22, the Japanese army arrested Han, the chief of the military law department of the Jilin provincial government. His whereabouts are still unknown. It is said that he has been killed by the Japanese army. (12) Japanese expatriates residing in Jilin are issued firearms by the Japanese army and have become armed plainclothes soldiers. (13) Since Jilin City was occupied by the Japanese army on July 21, the residents have been extremely frightened. Most of the students have fled, the schools have been suspended, and everything is in a state of emergency. The above is about the current situation in Jilin. As for the actions of the Japanese army after occupying Jilin, the following points should be noted: (1) The Japanese army's occupation of Jilin is not to protect Japanese expatriates but to invade Chinese territory. This can be proved by the above-mentioned facts and the following two points: (A) Since September 18, when the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, the Jilin Provincial Government has repeatedly declared to the Japanese consulate that it is willing to do its best to protect Japanese expatriates in the province, and there has never been any danger to the lives and property of Japanese expatriates since then. (B) When the Japanese army entered the city, it did not focus on protecting Japanese expatriates but hurriedly occupied official offices, provincial banks, and other banks, as well as telegraph offices and radio telegraph offices, and sent troops to guard the city gates. (2) We, the people of Jilin, express our firm opposition to the Japanese army's occupation of our territory. (3) The entire Jilin province is under the military rule of the Japanese army. Although the Japanese claim to the world that they have withdrawn their troops, the Japanese army invading Jilin has not actually withdrawn. If the Japanese army does not withdraw for a day, Jilin province will be under Japanese control, and the people of Jilin will not be able to get rid of fear and pain for a day. We deeply hope that Your Excellencies will pay attention to these facts, etc." (Omission below)</p>
<h3>News from the National Salvation Corps of Students Returning from Studying at the Japanese Military Academy</h3>
<p>Declares its Manifesto</p>
<p>Since the National Salvation Corps of students returning from the Japanese Military Academy moved to the YMCA next to the Great World, everything has gradually become clearer. The work has been very intense in recent days. Yesterday, three more representatives went to Beijing to report everything to the government. The corps will issue a telegram to the whole country within days to express its attitude to the people and report on the process and causes of this general withdrawal. It is planned to hold a general assembly every morning at 8:00 AM to discuss various matters. The attitude of the members is quite激昂(激昂). It was originally intended to carry out large-scale propaganda work throughout Shanghai, but now, due to government orders strictly prohibiting military personnel from participating in mass movements, it is currently under consideration. Yesterday, the President Meilun arrived in port, and 45 students from the 24th class who had withdrawn from school also arrived in Shanghai and were all placed in the YMCA. It is reported that the corps will organize a propaganda team today to conduct propaganda in all circles and distribute a manifesto, saying:</p>
<p>The National Salvation Corps of Students Returning from Studying at the Japanese Military Academy declares: Our eastern neighbor, the violent Japanese, have groundlessly used troops to brutally kill our compatriots, occupy our territory, burn and plunder our property, and bombard our important cities. Wherever their tyranny reaches, even the grass and trees are turned to ashes. Woe to our people, who have frequently suffered from natural disasters and have not yet finished groaning, and have suffered the pain of national subjugation. How can there be such a tragedy under the heavens, ancient and modern? We and others studied in the enemy country and received education from others. We deeply know that those who plot against us are not for us, and those who control others are often proud of themselves. We have already realized that staying is not the right place, and learning is difficult to achieve. Moreover, the plan of the Japanese slaves to launch their strength is decisive. We are deeply saddened by the atrocities of the Wanbaoshan Incident, the unreasonableness of the Nakamura Incident, and the brutality of the Korean people's massacre of Chinese people. In the blink of an eye before the blood and tears were dry, our great rivers and mountains were stained by the Japanese slaves again. Thinking of ourselves as military students, our duty is to defend the country. At this time of frequent national crisis, it is the day for us to abandon our lives and kill the enemy to save the country. How can we immerse ourselves in writing brushes and grinding inkstones and talk about military affairs with a few people on paper? Moreover, the Japanese Military Academy accepted us, not to provide their strengths to others but to use our weaknesses to complete their treacherous plan to disrupt China. To give a few examples as proof: (1) Divide our military. The school does not recognize the authority of our central government to uniformly send students, intending to make our military students in Japan abandon the central government and support private individuals. It挑撥(挑撥)the rights and wrongs of our students from the north and south, intending to sow seeds of discord among our military students in Japan. It助長(助長)the activities of anti-government factions, intending to make our military students tools for disrupting our country. When the incident occurred, the school authorities did their best to propagandize to our students that it had nothing to do with the northeastern and southwestern provinces, intending to cool the enthusiasm of our patriotic people. All military personnel of a country must receive education under a unified system and unify their technical thinking in order to achieve the effect of spiritual unity. How can it be imagined that the Japanese slaves implement these kinds of methods and affect the spiritual unity of our military personnel? (2) Cultivate pro-Japanese traitors. The school accepts three to five pro-Japanese elements in each class, without exception. It gives these elements preferential treatment and uses them as tools to embellish Sino-Japanese friendship while they are in school. After returning to the country, it gives them opportunities to be promoted and make a fortune under the cover of imperialism. Once their cultivation is successful, their work of betraying the country will increase with their安富尊榮(安富尊榮). Look at the betrayal of the country by Xi Qia and others today, is it not clearly touching our hearts? (3) Accept guides for war against China. From the student company commander to the squad leader, they are all familiar with Chinese geography, military affairs, and language. They usually take on the task of buying pro-Japanese traitors, and in wartime, they bear the responsibility of guiding the troops. In the Jinan Massacre, the first voice of the Tokyo citizens to strongly advocate being tough on China was the same person who advocated Sino-Japanese friendship (Lieutenant General Banxi). The leader of the front line was the Chinese student company commander (Lieutenant Colonel Jinzi). In this incident, all the pro-China generals and校官(校官) were调(调) three months ago to arrange them in Liaoning. The Chinese student company commander is also one of them. The intelligence they gather comes from us. We are aware that this Japanese Military Academy may be small, but its harm is profound. Since we have seen through this, how can we give the country a hidden danger for our personal vanity? Therefore, in deep pain, we made the decision to withdraw from school and organized the National Salvation Corps of Students Returning from Studying at the Japanese Military Academy. After withdrawing from school, we will first carry out short-term propaganda work to clarify the relationship between our national defense and the violent Japanese conspiracy against China. At the same time, we seek our people to recognize the Military Academy as a dangerous path and not to think of setting foot in it again, so as to completely destroy the Japanese slaves' mechanism for disrupting China and cut off the hidden dangers of the country. Next, we seek to be accepted under the systematic education of the government to complete our studies and strive to make effective sacrifices on the international battlefield. Finally, we will organize a national defense research association with this corps as a unit to study national defense issues and prevent all the powers from invading our old territory. Fortunately, our students have high patriotic enthusiasm and unite in an organized and planned group. At first, they endured the whipping of the military police, and then they resolutely fought a hunger strike. After coercion and inducement, they finally achieved their wish to withdraw from school. Today, we have bitterly left a foreign land and fortunately returned to our motherland. The violent Japanese's provocative behavior is becoming more and more serious, their troop increases are endless, and the bombing continues as before. The national salvation movement is迫於眉睫(迫於眉睫). Looking around at the people, the five-minute climax seems to have reached the last second. What is worse than the gradual demise? Who would have known that the violent Japanese's occupation of our northeast this time originated from the forced return of the Three Kingdoms' intervention and was launched during the economic panic of various countries in the world. Their determination to completely annex it cannot be shaken by the League of Nations' prohibition or non-prohibition, or by our government's resistance or non-resistance. If the national salvation spirit of our people slackens, the disaster of national subjugation will come soon. We and others have temporarily stayed in Japan, but our observation has not slackened. We regard this government's non-resistance as stemming from the fact that the people are not enough to serve as a backing. It is not too late to catch up. The blood of 400 million people is more than enough to flood the world. How can a small island country困(困) our China? Even if we and others have only Jingwei's strength, we cannot but act foolishly to fill the sea. However, our officials, fathers and elders, and brothers may regard us as粗浮(粗浮), as盲動(盲動), as投機(投機), as self-disturbing, as神經過敏(神經過敏), but driven by reason, we cannot help ourselves. We are not afraid to die, so why ask for議論(議論)? We will take the established方針(方針) and作决心(作决心) to fight. In war, we will be a member of the assault troops. If there is no war, we will serve under the central government and not follow any private individuals for self-enrichment, nor安於(安於) a corrupt environment and abandon ourselves. Only this body is dedicated to the country, and we are willing to have our brains smear the ground. We hope that patriotic people from all walks of life will give us guidance. We are truly waiting for orders to come. Printed and distributed by the National Salvation Corps of Students Returning from Studying at the Japanese Military Academy, October 22.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in the United States Raise Funds to Prepare for War</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the United Chinese Overseas National Salvation and Aid General Association in San Francisco yesterday, stating: I have read the telegram. The atrocities of the Japanese寇(寇) have aroused the indignation of all overseas Chinese. The people are of one mind. The conference was quickly established. After external propaganda, economic severance was implemented, and war funds were prepared in advance. Please ask the government to declare war on Japan, and we swear to be the backing. Please forward to the newspapers.</p>
<h3>Three Declarations by the Journalists' Union</h3>
<p>The third declaration of the Shanghai Journalists' Union: Fellow oppressed compatriots of all China, the tragic case of Japanese imperialism occupying the three northeastern provinces and massacring compatriots has been happening for a full month now. In such a serious and urgent moment, although our compatriots all over the country have been able to unite and work hard in the anti-Japanese national salvation and anti-imperialist struggle, as a result, we have only seen the aggression of Japanese imperialism intensify day by day, the anti-Japanese movement subside day by day, and the path to national subjugation is close at hand. A more painful fate has befallen each of us in the Northeast, not just those compatriots. Japanese imperialism's invasion of our three northeastern provinces is not a matter of one day or two. This time, occupying the area by force is just a means to complete the final invasion. Therefore, its cruel and rampant conspiracies and attempts in the three eastern provinces were expected by us long ago. At the same time, it is inevitable that it will directly suppress our resistance movement with gunboat diplomacy. It is pitiful that most of our compatriots were initially indifferent to this incident, as if nothing had happened; then hoped that the government and the League of Nations would resolve it through diplomatic means, and that it was not the people's business; and finally became disappointed and消沉(消沉) and voluntarily投入(投入) the fate of being caught and waiting to die. For months, we have only seen Japanese imperialism advance inch by inch and横暴(横暴) one after another. Even Shanghai, which is known as the paradise and Buddhist land of China, has also been oppressed by it. On North Sichuan Road, Japanese imperialism openly tore up anti-Japanese slogans in our country's shops and beat up compatriots. Although the country has not yet been subjugated, the scene of national subjugation has already appeared before our eyes. The Shanghai compatriots who are昏迷(昏迷) and逍遙(逍遙) have all tasted the惨(惨) of national subjugation. The authorities of the concessions, of course, take a non-interference attitude towards these暴行(暴行)s of the Japanese soldiers. It is pitiful that the Chinese government offices, which are responsible for protecting the lives and property of the people, can neither do anything nor dare to resist them. They can only叫(叫) the people to鎮靜(鎮靜), not to resist, and let Japanese imperialism oppress and massacre them. What is deplorable is that the Public Security Bureaus in Zhabei and Guangzhou dare to openly massacre patriotic compatriots and serve as executioners for Japanese imperialism. What is going on? Compatriots whose conscience has not died and whose red blood is not cold, we have long known that the League of Nations is a looting machine of imperialists. It is a large group that oppresses and divides the weak nations of the world. Therefore, this time we have been invaded by Japanese imperialism, and we should not beg it, let alone put our entire fate on it. The facts tell us that the League of Nations is helping Japan to force us to recognize the twenty-one articles of the treaty of national subjugation. Our result of begging for help is exactly like seeking the skin of a tiger, and讲(讲) humanity to a robber. A weak country has no diplomacy. This is something that everyone knows. China is the largest weak country in the world. Therefore, after China is invaded and oppressed by imperialists, the only way is for everyone to rise up and resist with force. There is absolutely no diplomacy to be spoken of. Especially for this kind of serious thing, there is only a way for the people to rise up and fight directly with the imperialists. But our government, at this critical moment when the country is in danger, not only cannot show any strength, but also退讓(退讓) to the imperialists at any time. The greatest embarrassment and unbearable things can be tolerated by the government, and it also wants the people to tolerate them. And most of our compatriots do not know the ancient训(训) of "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country," and only know to rely on the League of Nations. Some do not know that the current facts can only be liberated by relying on themselves. The situation on Sichuan Road for a week has clearly told us that we can still not strive to rise up and remain indifferent嗎(嗎)? Under this continuous attack of cold wind and bitter rain, even the iron and stone hearts will be moved. Is it possible that the compatriots of all China do not even have iron and stone hearts and have all become walking corpses? Compatriots, the death knell of national subjugation is ringing... The disaster of imperialist invasion is迫於眉睫(迫於眉睫). Don't hesitate any longer, and don't wait any longer. In order to save ourselves, we should hurry up and unite and strive together. Our slogans are: (1) Compatriots should automatically organize themselves and declare war on Japan. (2) Oppose begging the League of Nations. (3) Oppose suppressing the anti-Japanese movement. (4) Immediately expel the Japanese navy, army, and僑民(僑民) from the country. (5) Oppose the world war and support peace. (6) Overthrow imperialism. (7) All oppressed compatriots of China unite. (8) Long live the Republic of China. (October 21)</p>
<h3>Ten-Person Group Advocates Withdrawing from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Telegram to the Central Government's Proposal</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Salvation Anti-Japanese Ten-Person Group sent a telegram to Nanjing National Government yesterday, stating: Urgent to Nanjing National Government, the situation of the League of Nations is deteriorating, Representative Shi's measures are inappropriate, and the future of negotiations is extremely dangerous. Please be sure to: (1) Insist that Japan withdraw its troops unconditionally. (2) Not negotiate until the Japanese army has completely withdrawn and has not acknowledged compensation for our losses. (3) Immediately order Representative Shi to withdraw the statement of unconditionally obeying the League of Nations' resolutions. (4) If justice is not served, withdraw from the League of Nations immediately. The National Salvation Anti-Japanese Ten-Person Group Representatives' Conference叩(叩).</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Work in Various Circles</h3>
<p>The Tenth District Branch Conference of the Municipal Federation The Tenth District Branch of the Citizens' Union convened a members' meeting yesterday, chaired by Wang Rongtang.

(5) The inspection of Japanese goods should be peaceful to avoid unexpected disputes. (6) Japanese浪人(浪人) in this district often暴動(暴動). It was decided to notify the citizens in the district to temporarily endure small grievances. In case of an accident, they can communicate with each other and immediately notify this association to find a way to negotiate and stop it. (7) The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Phoenix Matches Prove to be Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association replied to the letter from the Smoke and Exchange Industry Association yesterday, stating: After this department consulted the Investigation Department and dispatched personnel for a thorough investigation, we have now received a reply stating, in brief, that although Phoenix brand matches are sold by Ruizhong Foreign Firm, we do not know its origins, which led us to believe that it was a Swedish product. But in fact, the Phoenix brand sold by Ruizhong Foreign Firm is in cooperation with the Japanese Datong Phosphorus Company. In terms of share capital, the Swedish merchant accounts for 51%, and the Japanese merchant accounts for 49%. Under such circumstances, the Phoenix brand cannot be regarded as a Swedish product. Moreover, the matches produced by the Huesheng Company in Shanghai are completely Japanese goods, and the brands used are all Chinese goods. Therefore, Phoenix brand matches should be confirmed as Japanese goods without any doubt, etc. Accordingly, we hereby reply for your information, hoping that you will instruct your colleagues to refuse to use them.</p>

<h3>Pacific Conference Inaugurated</h3>
<p>131 Representatives from Nine Nations Attend</p>
<p>Discussing Pacific Commercial Relations</p>
<p>Shen Shi Telegraph Agency reports: The Pacific International Studies Conference commenced yesterday (the 21st) morning at the International Recreation Club on Bubbling Well Road. Participants included 131 representatives from nine countries: China, Austria, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Fiji, the United States, and the Netherlands, along with 45 secretaries from various national delegations. At around 9:00 AM, a round table meeting began, discussing "Pacific Commercial Relations." Discussions were divided into four groups, chaired by: Group 1 – Mr. Copetto; Group 2 – Mr. Ding Wenjiang; Group 3 – Mr. Ross; Group 4 – Mr. Shu Wang-Mai. A recess was taken at 10:45 AM, followed by a joint session of all four groups at 11:15 AM. At 12:30 PM, the Chinese Committee hosted a banquet for all committee members. Chairman Xu Xinliu delivered a welcoming address, followed by a speech by Mr. Green, President of the Pacific Association from the United States. Representatives from various countries read congratulatory telegrams and messages from their respective governments. President Chiang Kai-shek's congratulatory telegram was read by Mr. Chen Liting. Finally, Dr. Hu Shi, the conference president, delivered a speech, fluent and moving, touching the entire assembly. After the banquet, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned. From 8:30 PM to 9:45 PM in the evening, Dr. Ding Wenjiang and three other notable figures lectured on economic development, geology, and other topics. The discussion proceedings and welcoming speeches are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Chinese Committee Members in Each Group</h3>
<p>The round table meetings yesterday were divided into four groups for discussion. The Chinese committee members in each group were as follows: Group 1: Wu Daquan, Xu Shuxi, Pan Guangdan, Ms. Zeng Baosun, He Lian; Group 2: Xia Jinlin, Chen Liting, Ning Encheng; Group 3: Hu Shi, Liu Jingshan, Madam Liu Zhanen, Dong Xian Guang, Ms. Wang Guoxiu, Ms. Wu Yifang; Group 4: Xu Xinliu, Zhang Boling, Tao Menghe, Zhang Zhuping, Yan Yuhang.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Tariffs and Silver Prices</h3>
<p>The four round table meetings discussing Pacific commercial relations primarily focused on the two issues of tariffs and silver prices, but other related events were also briefly mentioned. (1) Regarding the tariff issue, it was generally agreed that announcing a tariff moratorium or a period of tariff stability would be appropriate. However, realizing this would inevitably encounter many difficulties, with the issue of dumping being a particularly challenging point. Although all countries recognize their unwillingness to engage in dumping in other countries, there is no universally recognized definition of "dumping," and there are no accurate reports on the extent of dumping. Therefore, one of the suggestions put forward to the research committee is to undertake research on this point. The public also generally recognizes that increasing tariffs would increase the burden on consumers and hinder the development of international trade. However, economic nationalism often tends towards increasing tariffs. Although Japan adopts a protectionist tariff policy, it is heard that domestic opinions are quite divided, and doubts about the suitability of this policy are gradually increasing. For example, Japan uses a protectionist tariff policy to develop its national chemical industry, but there are also arguments in favor of allowing Germany to produce various chemicals, while Japan focuses on producing other goods that can be sold to Germany in exchange. However, the opposite is true in China. Generally, economists who theoretically believe in free trade advocate that China should currently adopt a protectionist tariff policy. Their reasons are firstly, China is in a world of protectionist tariffs, and secondly, China's industries are mostly in their infancy, so temporarily implementing protectionist tariffs is a justified measure. (2) The general conclusion regarding silver prices is that the decline in silver prices is not the cause of China's economic downturn, but rather the economic downturn is the reason for the decline in silver prices. As for the rise in silver prices, opinions on whether it is beneficial or detrimental to Chinese commerce are quite divided.</p>
<p>The various round table meetings made several practical suggestions to the Order and Research Committee, one of which has been unanimously agreed upon: the importance of improving Pacific commercial statistics. It was also suggested that the research department of the conference investigate. Other suggestions included studying the development of eliminating domestic and international economic barriers and abstractly researching whether the abolition of Pacific tariffs would be appropriate. When conducting this problem, if we can first study what practical impacts hypothetical free trade will have on various industries, we will be able to take more intelligent actions. Also, because expert opinions on these events differ greatly from national policies, it is advocated to study whether educational institutions can be used to train public opinion and reduce their separation.</p>
<h3>Xu Xinliu's Welcoming Address</h3>
<p>I have the opportunity to extend my sincere welcome to the representatives of the Pacific International Studies Conference for the third time. Although there may be an end to my welcoming words, my enthusiasm for welcoming them will increase day by day. Although there have been many changes during the preparation period for our gathering here to celebrate the opening of the conference, we are still very happy to be able to gather together today. Moreover, various tools of peace are now in danger of being broken one by one, but the Pacific International Studies Conference alone can stand still and resist all destructive forces. This is what we should be proud of. Today, in addition to representing the Chinese Council for the third time to express its sincere welcome to all of you, there is little else I can say. I am confident that we can fully meet the expectations of the general public for the Pacific International Studies Conference. Our attendance at this conference reflects our firm belief in the value of the Pacific International Studies Conference's steady and unbiased thinking. Please rise and join me in a toast to the realization of the ideals of the Pacific International Studies Conference and the success of this conference.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi's Speech</h3>
<p>Distinguished guests, this fourth Pacific International Studies Conference, although slightly different in form, has faced many serious doubts in the past few weeks. The Chinese representatives, as hosts of the conference, suddenly encountered a major national crisis, the severity of which has never been seen in history. Moreover, with this conference being held in China, although there is no formal public war between China and Japan, these two major countries on both sides of the Pacific are indeed in a state of war. The entire Chinese nation is being ignited by a strong sense of shame and resentment. At the beginning of their emotional upswing, the Chinese representatives could not help but doubt the usefulness of peaceful and deliberative international tools like this Pacific International Studies Conference. You probably already know that the Chinese Council proposed several times the possibility of postponing the conference, and the Japanese delegation also wanted to cancel the conference.</p>
<p>In the days before the conference, it seemed that this fourth Pacific International Studies Conference would be postponed. Looking back now, all the doubts, disappointments, and emotional outbursts have been completely dispelled and fully forgiven. We are always human, so we can't escape all kinds of weaknesses. This major international situation suddenly added to us is to test the degree of our faith in a doctrine, but we are not prepared. This crisis is too strong for those of us with weak faith. Now I dare say that all the Chinese representatives want to deeply apologize to all the representatives because in this unfortunate period, all these difficulties have caused you great inconvenience.</p>
<p>But today we are gathered together to hold the fourth Pacific International Studies Conference. Looking at the conference venue, the ceremony, and the slightly reduced number of representatives, this conference has changed somewhat, but as I said, this is a major conference. Allow me to take this opportunity to say a few words.</p>
<p>This conference has succeeded in the midst of fragmentation, thanks to the patience, wisdom, philosophy, and political talent of the general members of the conference, especially the philosopher chairman. Are the methods and ideals of this Pacific International Studies Conference only applicable to times of world peace and goodwill among all countries?</p>
<p>Today's meeting is not only forever memorable and a memorable page in the history of the Pacific International Studies Conference, but it is also worthy of commemoration in terms of the nature of international relations, agencies, and organizations, because it has established a glorious precedent. Many people can boast of having international minds in times of peace, but when reason is unreasonable and emotions are agitated, they calm down, study patiently, and discuss impartially.</p>
<p>But gentlemen, we should not be complacent because of this success. This international conference is still in its infancy. We have many thorny issues waiting for us to analyze and solve. If we observe these issues with an erroneous attitude and deal with them with prejudiced eyes, then our spirit and the methods we use will inevitably fail. If our views of others are obscured by emotions and prejudices, we will also fail. If we go astray, dye ourselves with the colors of sophistry for a particular belief, or have the spirit of a confessing sinner for a particular case, we will always fail.</p>
<p>On the first day of our work here, we must have a clear understanding of the nature of our problems and work. These problems are problems of countries and nations. Our work is for these countries and nations. For a nation or for many nations, this is the most sacred trust, but it is also the most dangerous work. This work, in the words of Chinese sages, "one word can make a country prosper, and one word can destroy a country." We can only remove prejudices to bear this sacred responsibility and resolutely prevent our thoughts and judgments from being obscured by prejudices and emotions. We are not here to cry, nor are we here to laugh, but only to understand everything. We are not here to teach, but only to exchange opinions with each other. As long as we have a harmonious spirit to seek the truth, then if there is a small success, it can be achieved.</p>
<h3>Mr. Green's Speech</h3>
<p>In brief, on behalf of the Pacific Council and all members of the conference, I would like to express our sincere gratitude for the welcome we have received. Preparing for such a conference is not an easy task. It requires many people to spend their time, energy, and goodwill to achieve it. The fact that we can generously meet this need shows not only the sincerity of the Chinese people's hospitality, but also the greatest purpose of the Pacific International Studies Conference, namely, to promote international friendship in the Pacific to obtain mutual sympathy and understanding, which is a direct service and has the highest value. Such gatherings allow men and women of insight from countries along the Pacific to conduct open investigations and patient research. No matter what issues are discussed, its success can be predicted. The conference's formal agenda promotes orderly thinking on urgent and important issues, and the knowledge thus increased will surely be of great value. What we have gained is first, to observe problems from the perspective of others. Although differences of opinion and conflicts of interest may still exist after the discussion is over, if we can maintain our opposition with a sincere, frank, and humble attitude, we will be able to respect each other and change the atmosphere. Second, cooperative research. The help obtained in various controversial issues enables today's civilized countries to abandon war and use peaceful meeting methods. People's psychology often follows the path of relying on laws and not valuing private fights. National psychology, which is progressing, may not be like this. This kind of change cannot be achieved overnight. Habits are derived from repeated experiences. However, its trend is already evident. Since the conclusion of the Treaty of Paris, the signatory countries have had a solemn obligation to promote it. Although there may be doubts about whether the League of Nations can be an effective mechanism for international cooperation, if all countries, whether they have joined or not, have the hope of peace and support it with all their strength, it will be able to make it a successful and effective tool for the people of the world and completely abandon the use of war as a tool of national policy. The Pacific International Studies Conference is also in the process of testing this same purpose. People who are skeptical and critical cannot be avoided, but we can all ignore them here. We only need to move forward according to the established route, engage in discussions and research unswervingly, and do not use investigation tools for propaganda. Judging from the experience of the past six years, the value of meetings and research has been demonstrated, and politicians from various countries are also paying close attention to the achievements of this conference. The greatest purpose of this conference is to enhance the mutual relations between countries, so we are not afraid to discuss even the most serious controversial issues. Many disputes are due to cultural reasons. If we can contact each other and exchange ideas and break down the barriers of language and writing, we can prevent the occurrence of international conflicts.</p>
<h3>Congratulatory Telegrams from Various Countries</h3>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek's congratulatory telegram said: I am deeply honored to represent the Chinese people and the National Government in extending my sincere congratulations and warm welcome to you. We hope that your visit to China and believe that your discussions at the conference will make an important contribution to promoting international relations in the Pacific. I am convinced that the ideals of world peace and international friendship will never be realized unless men and women from all countries, such as those attending this conference, are willing to spend their time and energy to study and understand the complex problems between countries. Today, the international community is filled with clouds of ignorance and malice, so we must do our best to maintain and consolidate the peacekeeping mechanisms that have been painstakingly built since the establishment of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In this atmosphere of suspicion and misunderstanding, the Pacific International Studies Conference is undoubtedly sufficient to fill this much-needed position and promote scientific knowledge and arouse rational sympathy among thoughtful people in various countries. The Pacific International Studies Conference will be able to establish its foundation for a more hopeful future.</p>
<p>In addition, those who sent congratulatory telegrams to the conference included US President Hoover, British Prime Minister MacDonald, New Zealand Prime Minister Forbes, Japanese Prime Minister Wakatsuki, Canadian Prime Minister Bennett, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the International Labor Organization.</p>

<h3>News of Disaster Relief for Flood Victims</h3>
<p>Huayang Yizhen Association's Disaster Relief Work</p>
<h3>Qingjiang Area</h3>
<p>The association received a telegram from the Qingjiang branch yesterday, stating that the flood situation in the Qingjiang area is most severe along Hongze Lake. It is planned to distribute flour in Siyang County. Investigations have already begun on the 19th and distribution will be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>Funing Area</h3>
<p>A letter from the Yancheng branch stated that the organization of the Funing branch has already begun. Emergency relief has already been distributed in various places, but the most important thing at present is to find ways to help the victims in the aftermath. Most of the victims will return home. Returning home is not difficult, but there is no way to solve the problems of clothing, food, and shelter. Not only is starvation inevitable, but the houses of the victims have mostly collapsed and the walls have fallen. The thatched roofs have been blown away by the wind and are no longer habitable. With winter approaching, repairs must be carried out quickly. How to settle the repair costs is a matter of concern for the general association.</p>
<h3>Taizhou Area</h3>
<p>The Taizhou branch is organized by 33 local gentry, with the county magistrate as chairman. Most of the school buildings have been allocated for sheltering disaster victims. Every day, the lives of four to five hundred people must be maintained. It is estimated that the disaster relief work will last for more than eight months. At present, in addition to providing food for the victims, the branch's work also includes diagnosing and treating diseases, burying the dead, and so on. They are also trying to enable these victims to return to their fields and resume their work. Hetaixian and Dongtai are in urgent need of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, because there are many places that have not been able to start relief efforts due to lack of funds.</p>
<h3>Dongtai Area</h3>
<p>The Dongtai shelter was opened in the last ten days of last month. The branch negotiated with the Dongtai County Magistrate and various disaster relief organizations to carry out work in the areas most severely affected by the floods. If the victims in various places do not receive adequate relief, then in winter, thousands and thousands of victims will starve to death.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Area</h3>
<p>The Wuhu branch has been established and the first allocation of 10,000 yuan has been remitted. The disaster relief plan has also been decided and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>Anqing Area</h3>
<p>A temporary disaster relief association has been organized in the area to temporarily carry out work for the association. The association has decided to allocate 5,000 yuan for standby use.</p>
<h3>Flood Relief Calligraphy and Painting Vouchers</h3>
<p>The association received a letter from the China Calligraphy and Painting Preservation Association Flood Relief Calligraphy and Painting Assistance Association, stating that they have collected 600 pieces of calligraphy and painting, divided into numbers, and issued 400 substitute price vouchers, each paper costing three yuan. The number of pieces obtained for each number is unequal, all of which are works by contemporary celebrities and are of great value. They are now sending 100 vouchers from No. 1 to No. 100, asking them to be distributed and the money collected. After receiving the money, the association will issue a receipt and send the money to Zhendong as soon as possible. Lovers of calligraphy and painting are requested to come to the association to purchase vouchers. They can not only obtain works by famous artists, but also benefit the victims of the disaster. It is truly a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan's Letter of Thanks to the Ningbo Emergency Relief Association</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, Standing Committee member of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, replied to the Ningbo Emergency Relief Association's Letter to the Provincial Flood Relief Committees, saying: I am writing to inform you that I have received the Zhan Tai letter, and have also raised 1,855.64 yuan for the Hubei flood disaster, 22 shares of Ningbo-Shaoxing Steamboat stock, and 400 yuan in whole sixth public bonds, all of which have been received. Your association's concern for the hungry and the drowning, and its extensive relief efforts are deeply admired. In addition to transferring the current funds to the disaster area, all stock and bond certificates have been entrusted to Mr. Wu Zhihao to be sold for cash. Once they are sold, the water bill receipt will be sent for verification. First, I would like to reply with thanks.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion of the Inheritance Lawsuit of Li Hongzhang's Great-Granddaughter</h3>
<p>Settling the Property Division Problem with Financial Compensation</p>
<p>Ending the Divorce Problem by Terminating the Lawsuit</p>
<p>Li Jia Zheng, the great-granddaughter of the late Qing Dynasty Prime Minister Li Hongzhang, the daughter of Li Fei Yun, and the niece of Li Mugong, left home on January 17 of this year due to abuse by her husband, Zhang Jinjiang. Afterwards, she commissioned lawyer Ge Zhaoji to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, first requesting her legal mother to return the dowry of 12,000 yuan and the 600 yuan savings deposit that her late father had promised to give her in his will. Afterwards, she filed another lawsuit against her husband for abuse, requesting a divorce. At the same time, Zhang Jinjiang requested cohabitation. Li Jia Zheng also filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, requesting her uncle Li Mugong and her brother Li Jiaxi to divide one-quarter of the jointly owned property left by her late father, because she was a weak and lonely girl and had difficulties in living alone outside. The court accepted all of the above matters one by one. The part of the claim for the return of the dowry has already been judged in the first instance, ordering Li's legal mother to return the full amount. The defendant did not accept the verdict and is still appealing. The divorce part is also still in the trial period. The property division part has also been preliminarily sealed by the court after the jointly owned houses on Xin Chongqing Road Xianyi Lane and other places were attached, pending trial and legal judgment. It is now known that the lawyers on both sides of the case have embraced the principles of settling matters in Ningbo, morality, peace, and have tried their best to mediate. They have obtained the consent of both parties to sign a settlement today to resolve a dispute and declare it to be calmed down. The contents are described separately below.</p>
<h3>Dowry and Property Division Issues</h3>
<p>The dowry was ordered to be fully returned in the first instance. The defendant, Li Zhao, did not accept the original verdict and appealed to the Second High Court Branch. After two court sessions, Chief Judge Hu repeatedly persuaded them to reach a peaceful settlement. The lawyers of both parties, based on the court's intentions, jointly mediated the property division issue. After several twists and turns, the following conditions were set: Li Jia Zheng completely abandoned the issues of returning the dowry and dividing the property. Li Mugong, Li Jiaxi, and others gave a whole number (the amount has been discussed and is approaching). After both parties signed, they requested the court to reach a settlement and withdraw the lawsuit in court. Li Jia Zheng's life will be self-sufficient from now on and has nothing to do with her family. As for whether she will divorce or remarry her husband in the future, or go to school, her family will not ask about it. However, the relationship between Li Jia Zheng and her uncle and brother has been damaged to some extent by this lawsuit. Before the relationship is restored, if they meet, both parties will still respect the elders and love the young. This treaty will be signed and implemented today.</p>
<h3>Cohabitation and Divorce Issues</h3>
<p>Since Li Jia Zheng filed for divorce from her husband, there have been several court sessions, but no judgment has been made so far. Yesterday was the date for the retrial. Lawyer Ge Zhaoji filed a petition with the court to request the termination of the lawsuit. The petition said: It is hereby stated that this case is scheduled to be heard again on October 21. However, due to the marital dispute between the parties, they are unwilling to proceed with it. According to Article 231 of the Civil Procedure Law, the parties may agree to terminate the appeal procedure. The aforementioned agreement shall be presented to the court hearing the case in writing or in a fixed term by both parties. Article 233 states that the parties who terminate the litigation procedure shall not continue the litigation within two months from the date of presentation of the termination. If the parties do not continue the litigation within six months from the date of presentation of the termination, it shall be deemed to be the same as withdrawing their lawsuit or appeal. It is observed that both parties in this case are willing to follow the circumstances of these two articles. Therefore, we jointly agree to file a statement, saying that we have heard that Li Jia Zheng will strive for a peaceful resolution of her marriage after the property division case is concluded.</p>

<h3>Wife of Cheng Yun Bursts into Tears Before Speaking</h3>
<p>Having Fully Tasted the Flavors of Marriage</p>
<p>Both Parties Agree to Divorce</p>
<p>The interpreter of Japanese lawyer Okamoto, a Chinese man named Cheng Yun, resides in the city. He married Ms. Xu Shihua several years ago. Recently, they suddenly became estranged, with Cheng frequently scolding and assaulting her. Xu, being an old-fashioned woman with no education, only knows the ancient teachings such as "Do not disobey your husband," "Serve your husband well," and "A husband is one to be looked up to for life." She accepted adversity with docility, but Cheng still did not understand her. In July, he even injured her in an assault. Xu then went to the city court to request a medical examination and took her son, Cheng Tai, to live with her mother. She hired a lawyer to file a petition with the First Special District Court, requesting mediation to allow her to live separately from Cheng. Cheng, on the other hand, first petitioned for mediation to cohabitate. After the mediation court summoned both parties and repeatedly advised them, it ultimately failed. Cheng then formally filed a lawsuit against Xu, demanding cohabitation. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Mo summoned them for trial. First, the plaintiff, Cheng Yun, stated his reasons for demanding the defendant to cohabitate. Then, defendant Xu Shihua was questioned. Before Ms. Xu could even speak, tears were streaming down her face, and she sobbed uncontrollably. She then recounted, amidst tears and sobs, the repeated abuse she had suffered from the plaintiff, and how she had served her parents-in-law and diligently cared for her husband. She said that the doctor had advised the plaintiff not to eat nourishing foods, but she would feed him a bowl of her own milk every day. Yet, he still showed no affection or righteousness to this extent. If she were to continue to live with him, she would surely be abused to death. As she had fully tasted the flavors of marriage, she now wished to spend her days relying on needlework and had no intention of remarrying. Judge Li then questioned Cheng Yun about the alleged abuse, but Cheng firmly denied any abuse, saying that if the defendant were to cohabitate with him, their relationship might recover. However, the defendant's attitude was also very firm, resolutely refusing to cohabitate. Judge Li, seeing that one party demanded cohabitation while the other absolutely refused, realized that even if he ruled for cohabitation, it would be difficult to enforce. He then advised the plaintiff to consider carefully. At this time, the defendant also verbally changed the purpose of her complaint, advocating for divorce. She volunteered to return her son, Cheng Tai, to the plaintiff and requested that the plaintiff return her clothing to her. The plaintiff immediately agreed. Judge Li then made a record of the settlement, generally allowing the two parties to divorce. The child, Cheng Tai, would be raised by the plaintiff. The defendant's clothing, stored at the plaintiff's residence, would be returned to the defendant, and the case would be closed. All transfer procedures would be handled by the old woman, Wei Panbinyuan, who had originally brought the two parties together years ago, within one week. The woman would take the child back to the Cheng family and retrieve Ms. Xu's clothing, so that the two parties would not meet and cause conflict. This shows the judge's painstaking efforts.</p>

<h3>Hongqiao Road Repairs Completed</h3>
<p>Route 4 Bus to Reopen on the 1st of Next Month</p>
<p>Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai was built by foreigners beyond their concession. It has fallen into disrepair over the years. This spring, the British Works Bureau proposed to repair the road. However, the city government, concerned about issues of sovereignty, was reluctant to allow it. After repeated consultations, the city government finally understood and allowed them to repair the original road surface, but forbade them from expanding or widening it. Now, the entire road has been repaired, and all the bridges have been rebuilt. The Shanghai South Public Route 4 bus, which runs on this road, is scheduled to resume service as usual on the 1st of next month.</p>
<h3>The Union of Celluloid Manufacturers in This City</h3>
<p>Celluloid manufacturing is a recent industry in our country. There are already several factories operating in this city. It is said that their purpose is to recover rights and resist foreign goods. Therefore, they each operate according to their specialized knowledge. Since the establishment of these factories, the quality of their manufacturing, the abundance of their production, and the prevalence of their sales have shown a trend of driving out foreign goods and replacing them. The recovery of rights has indeed been considerable. Currently, these industry colleagues, in view of the rampant behavior of violent Japan and filled with righteous indignation, are urgently uniting the industry, pooling their resources and efforts, and adhering to the spirit of unity and cooperation, in order to achieve the goal of permanent economic severance with Japan. Therefore, the establishment of a union was initiated. On the 18th of this month, the Shanghai Celluloid Manufacturing Factory, Da Zhongguo Chemical Society, Da Zhonghua Celluloid Manufacturing Factory, China Ping Pong Company, Guoguang Artificial Ivory Factory, and others gathered at Daqing Lane on Nanjing Road, discussed and determined the charter, and established the Celluloid Manufacturers' Union, named the Shanghai Celluloid Manufacturing Industry Association. It is reported that they have sent letters to various agencies for record-keeping.</p>

<h3>Continued Hearing on the Hou Dachun Embezzlement of Overseas Aid Donation Case</h3>
<p>The Sixth District Party Headquarters Continues to Report</p>
<p>Hou and Former Employees Defend Themselves</p>
<p>Hou Dachun, a standing committee member of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, was accused of embezzling 500 yuan in overseas aid donations. The First District Party Headquarters, Fifth District Party Headquarters, and Sixth District Party Headquarters simultaneously submitted reports to the Central Government impeaching him. The Sixth District Party Headquarters yesterday submitted a further report to the Central Government. The report is transcribed below:</p>
<p>The Sixth District Party Headquarters Continues to Report:</p>
<p>Reporting on the Hou Dachun case of embezzling overseas aid donations, where new evidence reveals his guilt and attempts to destroy evidence, further exposing his insidious and evil nature. A request to the government to immediately remove him from his position, order the court to file a public prosecution, and punish him severely according to the law. The reporting association is reporting on the case of Hou Dachun's embezzlement of 500 yuan donated by the Commercial Press to aid overseas Chinese in Korea under the guise of the Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Committee. After the incident, the executive committee member of the reporting association, Feng Yixian, collected evidence and submitted it to the committee, requesting a thorough investigation. At this time of intense anti-Japanese work, after the case was reported, all sectors of Shanghai society were filled with anger and unanimously demanded severe punishment to serve as a warning. If Hou Dachun still had any conscience, he should surrender and await punishment from party discipline and the law to apologize to the people. However, knowing the seriousness of the case, he dared to return the embezzled funds and destroy the evidence, displaying his insidious and evil nature, hoping to retaliate. Suddenly, on the morning of October 20th, he secretly brought 500 yuan to Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, to discuss the matter and return the full amount, retrieving the temporary receipt. His intention is self-evident. After learning of the conspiracy, the reporting association immediately sent personnel with a letter to track him down. Wang Yunwu detailed Hou Dachun's fundraising and repayment process, and immediately issued a formal reply to prove it. Looking back on the massacres of overseas Chinese in Korea, the people of the country were filled with grief and indignation. All sectors of the country rushed to donate, hoping to contribute even a small amount to help those in distress. In late July, when the overseas Chinese had no food or lodging and were crying out for help, this large sum of 500 yuan was related to the lives of several overseas Chinese. Those overseas Chinese were fortunate enough to escape the clutches of the Japanese bandits, with their lives saved from the tiger's mouth. However, they were ultimately not saved, or even became vagrants and died. Who killed them? It was Hou Dachun who embezzled the donations to aid the overseas Chinese and caused their deaths. The so-called "killing without being seen" is Hou Dachun's insidious and evil heart, which is worse than the Japanese bandits, the national enemy. He turned a deaf ear to the wails of the people and did not care about the lives of the overseas Chinese. He did not know what national law or party discipline was, losing his reason and destroying his humanity. The Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Association ended on September 24th, and Hou Dachun's crimes were reported as early as October 12th. This is a fact known to all. He still thought of deceiving the heavens and stealing the sun, covering his ears while stealing the bell. On July 23rd, he raised the funds. On July 24th, the Commercial Press recorded it in the books. Now, on October 20th, after the case was reported, he asked to return the funds. After a long period of ninety days, he still wanted to cover up the truth and destroy the evidence of the crime. Is he deceiving people or deceiving the heavens? The law has clear provisions, and the crime cannot be denied. His evil wisdom is beyond the reach of others, and his stupidity is also difficult for others to achieve. If his conspiracy is allowed to succeed and his evil plan is carried out, then what heaven is there, what national law is there, and what party discipline is there? Those who are harmed and undermined in the future will not know where to turn. Respectfully reciting the Premier's revolutionary will of "revolutionizing the heart" is to show to comrades, deeply and thoroughly. To talk about revolution without revolutionizing the heart is no different from Zhi's talking about benevolence and righteousness. One horse is enough to harm the group, and one person is enough to mislead the party. In this anti-Japanese national salvation movement, how much have the Chinese people lost? Many corrupt merchants have been punished. The reason why the masses can accept sacrifices willingly and accept punishment willingly is because of the people's patriotism and the appeal of party righteousness and party ethics. If we can rectify the party, we can gain the trust of those outside the party. One cannot correct others when one is not correct oneself. Is it better to correct oneself to enhance the party's prestige, or to rectify oneself to revitalize the party's discipline? For the sake of protecting the party and the country, for the sake of tightening the anti-Japanese national salvation work, and for the sake of deepening the people's faith, we are submitting the newly obtained ironclad evidence and photocopies, hoping that the committee will review the case and immediately remove Hou Dachun from his position and permanently expel him from the party, and order the court to file a public prosecution and severely punish him according to the law to serve as a warning and maintain party discipline. The submitting association is filled with apprehension and awaits orders. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Shanghai Special Municipality Sixth District Party Headquarters, Standing Committee Member Feng Xiancheng, October 21, 1931. Attached: Photocopy of the Commercial Press's reply letter, two announcements from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Association received by the Relief Association, and three supplementary video photos. Original letter of proof from the Commercial Press, "Zongyu No. 778": In response to today's letter, respectfully informed that the former Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Association raised 500 yuan in aid funds from our library, which was raised by Mr. Hou Dachun and paid on July 23. Later, Mr. Hou said that because the association was reorganized, the funds had not been used and had been returned in full this morning. Inquired and replied. Respectfully, the Executive Committee of the Sixth District Party Headquarters, Commercial Press, October 20, 1931.</p>
<p>The Second District Party Headquarters' Submission:</p>
<p>The Second District Party Headquarters submits ten charges to the City Party Headquarters. The text states that it is submitting a request for a prompt and thorough investigation to clarify the truth and maintain the party's reputation. Recently, we received a public announcement from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, stating that Hou Dachun, a standing committee member of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, used fraudulent means to solicit donations from Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, under the guise of the Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Association, while serving as the standing committee member and director of the inspection department of the former All-Circles Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Committee. Mr. Wang generously agreed to donate 500 yuan. Hou Dachun then sent Wang Yongliang, a staff member of the inspection department, to the library on July 24th to stamp and receive the money. Hou then embezzled the entire amount and put it into his private pocket. The secretariat of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association learned of this and believed that it was undermining the anti-Japanese national salvation work and related to the reputation of the entire organization, so they filed a report and submitted the evidence to the Central Government for impeachment. Now, the details of the incident and the collected evidence are listed. The reporting association was shocked and inexplicable after reading it. At this time of foreign aggression and national crisis, all citizens should do their best to devote themselves to the work of saving the country, so how can they be allowed to use the name to solicit money and enrich themselves? If the allegations in the announcement are true, then the one being accused is insane, worse than a party worm or a traitor. We should all abandon him. However, although there is a cause for the incident, what is the truth? We should ask the committee to promptly and thoroughly investigate to maintain the party's reputation. Whether or not it is appropriate, we should submit a document for consideration and implementation. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City of the Chinese Nationalist Party, the Second District Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Hou Dachun's Notice:</p>
<p>Notice to the public: Recently, Feng Yixian and others have fabricated facts and submitted false accusations to the Central Party Headquarters, and disseminated pamphlets, falsely claiming that Dachun did not report the 500 yuan he solicited from the Commercial Press during his tenure in the inspection department of the former All-Circles Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Committee, accusing him of intending to embezzle the funds. I have submitted the facts to the Party Headquarters for clarification and requested a fair investigation to clarify the truth and correct the wrong. I am deeply afraid that these rumors will confuse the public's perception, so I am presenting the facts as follows: At the beginning of the establishment of the Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Association, it was decided that each committee member would raise donations. Dachun, as one of the committee members, had the obligation to raise funds. He solicited 500 yuan from Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, and reported it to the standing committee members Wang Xiaochen, Wang Yansong, Lu Jingshi, and others. At that time, the official receipt of the Overseas Aid Association had not been printed. All the work of the association required funds, so I first collected the donation and advanced it, asking the association to issue a temporary receipt first. At that time, Mr. Wang Yansong advocated that there was no need to use a temporary receipt to avoid adding procedures. Dachun, who was then the director of the inspection department, felt that the association's funds were tight and the work was difficult to carry out, so he consulted with other standing committee members and agreed to use the funds first. Dachun personally issued a temporary receipt and attached a letter stating that he would exchange it for an official receipt in the future and sent staff member Wang Yongliang to the Commercial Press to collect the funds and hand them over to the inspection department for use (as evidenced by the account books of the inspection department). It was originally planned to transfer the funds after the official receipt of the association was printed, but the chairman of the Anti-Japanese Association, Mr. Yu Zhiqing, did not stamp the official donation receipt, so it could not be used. The establishment of the Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Relief Committee could have transferred the funds to the committee, but the Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Association was unable to repay the inspection department due to financial constraints, which led to the delay. This is the process of the 500 yuan being retained by the department for use. By mid-September, the inspection department was reorganized into the detective department, and Dachun was still appointed as director. Then, on September 22, the Overseas Aid Association was reorganized into the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association because of the Japanese invasion of Dong Province. The detective department of the association took over the affairs of the former Overseas Aid Committee's detective department. The amount of funds used and the amount retained was clearly stated in the transfer file and could be easily verified. Since then, the funds have been used as advances for the detective department. Until October 19, someone came to tell me that those who did not understand Dachun had collected evidence of corruption and reported it to the Central Government. After careful examination, the so-called evidence of corruption referred to this 500 yuan. I couldn't help but laugh. The funds were indeed in the detective department. Since there was an excuse, I went to the detective department to inquire. According to the director of the department, Mr. Wang Changyuan, the funds advanced by the former inspection department were returned to the Overseas Aid Association on October 4. The donation from the Commercial Press was not missing. Dachun had already explained to the Commercial Press that this kind of donation could not be solicited by other committee members because there was no official receipt, and only the Commercial Press had donated. In the future, the funds were still intended to be returned. Now that they had been returned without any loss, they should be returned to the Commercial Press as soon as possible to fulfill the previous promise. Later, Dachun withdrew the funds from the detective department of the Anti-Japanese Association and returned them in full to the Commercial Press, which was received by Mr. Wang Yunwu. Unexpectedly, rumors arose this morning, with the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation People publishing pamphlets and Feng Yihang publishing in newspapers, saying that the former director Hou had embezzled the donation, which was shocking. The staff knew the details of the donation, so how could they allow anyone to falsely accuse Director Hou with false accusations? I am stating the facts and dare to prove that the former director Hou has absolutely no embezzlement of donations. I am also submitting the pamphlets and newspaper clippings and requesting that the committee review the case and uphold justice. (Abbreviated below).</p>
<p>As for Dachun's responsibilities in schools and the Party Headquarters, they are also used as tools for attack, which shows his intentions even more. I will not add to the defense. Dachun has been serving in labor unions and Party Headquarters for many years, and the distinction between public and private rights and obligations is clear. In particular, the entry and exit of funds is related to personality, and I dare not be negligent. All of this is known to the public. However, in serving public organizations, resentment is inevitable. Moreover, Dachun is straightforward by nature, hates evil like an enemy, and often offends people because of this. However, I never expected that people would repay frankness with despicable means, taking advantage of the resentment. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel chilled. Now, I have been defamed for no reason, although the truth will eventually come to light. However, those who defame me are using all means, and I am deeply afraid of confusing the public. Therefore, I dare to state the facts as above, hoping that the people of society will understand. Hou Dachun, October 21st.</p>
<p>Submission from Former Employees:</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that Chen Ji, Liu Jianqi, Luo Deming, Wang Jinwu, Hu Zongzhen, Ye Huixun, Lu Xisen, Zhao Zuoyan, Cai Liansun, Zhang Shousong, Gu Rongsheng, Zhou Zifu, and other former employees of the inspection department of the former Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Committee submitted a report to the executive committee of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday on the facts of the case. The report stated that it was reporting the details of the 500 yuan donation raised from the Commercial Press for the former Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Committee's inspection department, and proving that the former director Hou Dachun was definitely not intending to embezzle the funds, requesting that the funds be reviewed to dispel the false accusations. The former inspection department of the Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Committee began operating on July 23 of this year. At that time, it was just established, and funds were needed everywhere. The association had no funds to allocate, so the former director Hou solicited 500 yuan in aid funds from Mr. Wang Yunwu of the Commercial Press. The former inspection department borrowed the funds and stated that the funds were borrowed and would be returned to the committee after the official receipts were printed and issued. Not only did the staff know about this, but many members also knew the details. On July 24, the former inspection department sent staff member Wang Yongliang to the Commercial Press to receive the 500 yuan in full. Later, the official receipts could not be issued because some members were unwilling to stamp them. The former inspection department could not collect funds smoothly and used the funds to make advances (for example, the fact that the advances pre-paid by various district offices exceeded the amount allocated by the accounting department can be verified by comparing the dates of the receipt of funds and the dates of allocation). By the end of the inspection department on September 20, it owed more than 200 yuan in operating expenses, which was paid by the association on October 4. Because the detective department needed funds, it was transferred to the detective department for temporary emergency advances. The funds were always stored in the former inspection department, now in the detective department's general director Chen Ji's possession. Until the 20th of this month, the former director Hou requested the 500 yuan to be returned. Because there was no official receipt from the Anti-Japanese and Overseas Aid Association, and the period for collecting aid funds had ended, the 500 yuan was returned to the Commercial Press and received by Mr. Wang Yunwu. Unexpectedly, rumors arose this morning, with the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation People issuing pamphlets and Feng Yihang publishing in newspapers, saying that the former director Hou had embezzled the donation, which was shocking. The staff knew the details of the donation, so how could they allow anyone to falsely accuse Director Hou with false accusations? I am stating the facts and dare to prove that the former director Hou has absolutely no embezzlement of donations. I am also submitting the pamphlets and newspaper clippings and requesting that the funds be reviewed and that justice be upheld. (Abbreviated below).</p>

<h3>Chinese Typewriter and Travel Pillow Stool Sell Well</h3>
<p>Industrialist Yu Binqi invented the Chen New-style Chinese typewriter last year. After obtaining a manufacturing patent approved by the National Government, he carefully researched and achieved great success. All parts are made entirely domestically, such as steel type and rubber rollers, which were the last to be successfully developed. The typewriter has perfect equipment and is durable, so all sectors are happy to purchase it. Recently, he also invented a travel pillow stool (i.e., a steel exquisite pillow stool), which also obtained a government patent. The pillow stool uses pure steel wire as a pillar, can withstand pressure of three hundred pounds, is electroplated, white, and beautiful. It can be used as a seat or a pillow. Those who are prone to seasickness can use it to avoid dizziness. It can be raised and lowered, and shakes naturally, remaining level. When not in use, it folds to only five inches wide, eight inches long, and half an inch thick, and can be placed in a pocket like forty copper coins. It is said that the product is now in cooperation with the China Products Trading Company established by Xu Shiying, Zhang Zilian, Zhao Shouyu, Xiang Kangyuan, and Li Weicheng at No. 141 Guizhou Road, and that place has been designated as the general distributor. The company fully promotes domestic goods and welcomes all sectors to investigate and visit during this boycott period, it is said.</p>
<h3>Notice to Readers and Correspondents</h3>
<p>This column of readers' correspondence has always been limited to three types of questions: education, career, and marriage. Since the outbreak of the Japanese invasion of Northeast China, we have received dozens of letters every day discussing how to solve the Northeast problem and how to deal with Japan's atrocities. This is a passionate manifestation of compatriots' patriotism, which we greatly admire. Now, we would like to make an agreement with you: since you have temporarily set aside personal issues such as education, career, and marriage and are eager to study methods of saving the country, please express your opinions on the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) What kind of position should our country take regarding the League of Nations that would be most appropriate?</p>
<p>(2) What is an effective way to boycott Japanese goods? (You may focus on one industry or one region.)</p>
<p>(3) How can the training of volunteer armies be promoted and sustained?</p>
<p>(4) How can the hearts of the whole nation be united to fight against foreign aggression?</p>
<p>Each answer should be limited to a maximum of one thousand words. Please avoid empty talk and focus on practical methods. This newspaper will select the best submissions based on the capacity of this column and publish them for open discussion. If you agree with the methods proposed by others, please also state so. Please also provide your full name, gender, age, occupation or place of study, and native place, and attach a correspondence stamp and a sufficient number of postage stamps so that those whose letters are not published can be informed by mail. Matters concerning education, career, and marriage will continue to be handled as before. Respectfully,</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of Feng Yixian exposing Hou Dachun, which your newspaper published yesterday, if any of it involves me, Wang Yongliang, I am deeply concerned that various sectors may misunderstand. I am issuing a special statement as attached, hoping it will be published. Sincerely, Wang Yongliang, October 21, with attached statement.</p>
<p>"Wang Yongliang's Statement"</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the matter of me, Wang Yongliang, signing for the payment form from the Commercial Press for Feng, because Mr. Hou Dachun and I were colleagues, and he was busy, he gave me a receipt and a letter to Mr. Wang Yunwu, asking me to collect it from the Commercial Press on his behalf. At the Commercial Press, the person collecting the payment must also sign. I was only acting as a proxy to collect the payment and hand it over to Mr. Hou of the Inspection Department. As for other circumstances, I believe Mr. Hou will make a statement. I not only did not know about it, but was completely unrelated.</p>
<p>Regarding the fact of receiving living expense slips, after investigation, there were nine staff members in the Inspection Department, including Wang Yongliang, Zhang Yaoming, and Sang Yutang. All staff members issued this kind of slip when receiving living expenses, which has nothing to do with this case.</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the report in your newspaper of October 21, Local News section, about Zhuang Chunfu accusing Ren Zhennan of fraud, it mentioned that Qian Yumin was the "runner" for lawyer Fei Xizhen. Upon investigation, our law firm has never employed a runner besides our clerks, and this Qian Yumin is not known to our lawyer at all. Fearing misunderstandings from various sectors, we are writing to request that your newspaper correct this. Sincerely, Lawyer Fei Xizhen, October 22.</p>

<p>Min Yin</p>
<p>Since hearing the news of Japanese warships opening up to the Wusongkou, the atmosphere along Baoshan Road has become tense. The clouds in the sky have also become dim, and people's hearts seem to be filled with a sense of sorrow. This feeling has gradually erupted. Aside from eating and sleeping, no one is willing to do their usual work, because this sorrow has gripped the minds of a large number of people.</p>
<p>Yes, under such a serious and tense atmosphere, everyone is concerned about the future of the country. Everyone knows that the Northeast problem can affect the future of the entire nation.</p>
<p>The autumn wind has risen. This year's autumn wind is indeed not as peaceful as usual. This rustling autumn wind seems to be encouraging the development of sentimental moods. The fluctuations of nature naturally increase people's worries. The people along Baoshan Road are close to the Japanese naval headquarters in North Sichuan Road, so they naturally feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Xu studies at the law school. His home is in the middle section of Baoshan Road, near the western part of Baoxing Road. He used to live a peaceful reading life every day, taking the bus to school in the morning and returning from school by bus in the evening.</p>
<p>"Xu's life is indeed very pleasant," Xu's classmates usually said.</p>
<p>"That is indeed a very peaceful life, Xu's life," Xu's relatives usually said.</p>
<p>Indeed, Xu's usual life is most suitable for the four words "pleasant" and "peaceful." No one would issue opposing arguments to resist the criticisms of his classmates and relatives.</p>
<p>Now, living on Baoshan Road and attending school, Xu feels it is inappropriate to accept the four words "peaceful life" given to him. He is living a very melancholy school life.</p>
<p>Every day when he steps onto the bus to school, he feels an abnormal sense of boredom. He goes through school life feeling bored. He feels that living in a school environment is too individualistic. He thinks about the compatriots in the Liaoning area who are being killed by artillery shells, too many, too tragically. When he sees the newspaper, he cannot help but cry, complaining that he is a weakling, an irresponsible citizen, and a most boring citizen. He feels that such a comfortable life is not suitable in China.</p>
<p>The atmosphere along Baoshan Road is indeed becoming increasingly tense. From the reports of friends living nearby, he initially believed that the Japanese navy would launch a violent attack on China. Seeing the hurried situation of people hiring rickshaws to move, he felt grief. He told his parents that he wanted to move to the French Concession to hide, and at the same time, he restored his individualistic will. He liked the wealthy environment of his family. He smiled, pondered, and became excited. He forgot that he was a student, bearing the responsibility of "serving the country," bearing the responsibility of adding glory to the future of the nation. He forgot the blood of the compatriots in Liaoning, forgot the suffering fate of the compatriots. He liked to look forward to the comfortable life of moving to the French Concession tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, his weak attitude soon changed. He went out for a walk and found that many compatriots were working hard to resist. He felt that these many compatriots were willing to sacrifice everything to fight the Japanese to the death. The atmosphere along Baoshan Road was serious. No one wanted to move, no one wanted to live a life far away from individualism, enjoying a momentary happy life peacefully and pleasantly.</p>
<p>Seeing such an active and struggling atmosphere, Xu became as excited as if he had drunk coffee. His individualistic will disappeared like a cloud, his weak dreams also disappeared, and his irresponsible dreams also disappeared. He felt that the fantasy half an hour ago was truly the most shameful fantasy, the most despicable fantasy, the most boring fantasy, which should not have existed at this time of national crisis. Otherwise, this reasoning would mean that he was willing to be a "slave of a conquered nation," willing to be a prisoner, willing to be meat under the knives of the Japanese. He thought about the spirit of Yue Fei's painful drinking of Huanglong, he thought about the spirit of Goujian's sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, he thought about many great patriotic souls of ancient times. He seemed to see their portraits in front of his eyes, glaring at him, despising him, suppressing him, warning him...</p>
<p>Now, Xu is moved by the idols of the great souls in his mind. He kicks up patriotic enthusiasm, he kicks up active will. Since waking up from the dream, he deeply believes that the demise of our nation is due to the lack of spirit of the youth. He deeply believes that the hot blood of dying for the country has an imperishable value. He deeply believes that this hot blood is a bright hope. He deeply believes that this hot blood is the greatest commemoration, a commemoration that adds glory to the nation. If the world does not perish, this hot blood will continue to exist, grow, and emit a tragic music.</p>
<p>Xu thought of these positive thoughts, and forgot everything.</p>
<p>"Move what house?" he thought.</p>
<p>"I am determined to die here, like the patriotic compatriots in this area," he continued to think.</p>
<p>"Dying for the country is eternal life," he stood up and shouted.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction: Two Booklets of Different Natures 丨New Era Oriental Review 丨</p>
<p>In this era of decline for large magazines and stagnation for small newspapers, the emergence of small booklets can truly be described as springing up like bamboo shoots after rain, becoming popular for a time. However, among these many publications, it is truly rare to find a few that are somewhat worthy of a look.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that there are absolutely none. For example, what I am about to introduce to the reader at this moment are a few that are relatively interesting.</p>
<p>1. "New Era" This publication, judging by its publication date and issue number, is still a newborn child. However, its content is the opposite, full of the demeanor of an adult, just like a young person in puberty, full of fervent emotions and lively atmosphere. Not to mention anything else, just its few illustrations, which are full of youthful enthusiasm, are enough to look down on all other booklets without shame. Now, because I do not have a current copy on hand, I cannot extract one or two paragraphs of text to introduce to the reader, but we only need to observe its material selection to know that its content is as enthusiastic as a torch. Its material selection is roughly divided into the following types:</p>
<p>I. Commentary In this column, we can probably glimpse the thoughts and purposes of young people in the current era.</p>
<p>II. Thoughts and Essays In this column, we can discover many things that the general public wants to say but dares not say, or has never said, or even things that the general public has not yet felt.</p>
<p>III. School News and Youth Activities This is the most important column for this publication. Any news about any aspect of various schools, as well as the activities of young people, the darlings of the era, are all available and listed in a colorful and diverse manner before us.</p>
<p>In short, in here, it is all what I call "enthusiasm and vitality."</p>
<p>According to the nature of this booklet, it is entirely a pure youth publication. Everything that young people need from various publications, it fully provides to you. Ah, this is the only good youth publication!</p>
<p>2. "Oriental Review" This publication is still in the initial stage, but its expression of spirit is no less than that of "New Era." If you don't believe me, please take a look at a few articles in its second issue, such as "Compatriots Arise Quickly to Save the National Crisis," "Alas, the Great Han Nation of Deities and Nobles," "My View on Japan's Dispatch of Troops to the Northeast," "Miscellaneous Talks on Northeast Border Affairs," "The Current Economic Situation of Japan," etc. From this, it can be seen that its nature is completely different from the two publications above. It is entirely a timely publication that focuses on current affairs, politics, and economics. In particular, what deserves a special introduction from me is a few of the illustrations, whose meaning is profound and powerful, admirable and unprecedented. Even compared with the illustrations in several famous major newspapers at present, I am afraid that they only surpass them, with nothing falling short.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I responsibly declare to the readers again that the three booklets I am introducing now are guaranteed to satisfy you after reading them, and you will definitely not say that I am deceiving you. I also add that I could have copied a glimpse of the contents of the above three publications here as proof of what I have boasted above, but in the end, due to the limited and valuable space of this column, I was unable to make such a detailed and practical introduction, which I regret very much. However, they each have their own value of existence, enough to gain your trust, so I believe that this kind of copying work is also unnecessary, so I resolutely omitted it.</p>
