<h3>中央對粤决不輕啓兵釁</h3>
<p>蔣對立法委員之演說</p>
<p>張繼定八日離粤來滬</p>
<p>南京蔣主席五日午宴立法院全體委員時演說大意謂粤變發生以來各方頗多揣測和驚疑實際上并無多大問题粤事不過爲黨務和政治上之一種糾纷中央應付綽有餘裕故中央對於粤事一本和平精神决不輕啓兵戎如萬一不幸發生兵事中央亦可制裁惟今日中國唯一之敵人爲赤匪倘再予赤匪以可乘之機則將來不但影響於本黨即中華民族勢非淪亡不可中央現在决以全力撲滅赤匪云云族由邵元冲王用賓等起立歷述年來削平叛亂維持中夏威信并保存本黨光榮歷史惟國家和人民因削平叛逆受損不少希望以後避免一切兵爭凡政治糾纷均由法律解决但法律本身極爲空洞故欲法之有效則必須全國人民共同遵守甚盼蔣主席以歷次削平叛逆之精神遵守國家法律爲四萬萬國民模範（六日專電）</p>
<p>南京蔣主席對人表示此次粤事發生純係黨務問題應就黨務範圍内求適當解决途徑若因黨務而破壞和平糜爛地方爲赤匪造機會致國家與人民受意外危害直不啻自行滅绝本黨之運命將何所逃罪於天地之間等語一般人觀察認爲粤事尚有和平之轉機（六日專電）</p>
<p>南京某委談粤局情勢日前頗爲缓和嗣九將領電詰孫科後彼方略有微詞致旅滬某要人電口氣中仍含和平討論爲限不欲見諸武力經此方答謂乃將領對孫個人責備絶非中央意似無關接洽步驟此項理由仍由某要人由滬電拍大約某院長將俟次電到時接洽完竣後方能北還總之和平途徑漸寛粤方已受易發難收之苦因之與中央較有接近意味原定各院部補充人選至此暫行緩辦俾對離職各員稍存客氣仍望其歸來也（六日專電）</p>

<p>要聞</p>
<h3>張羣在平暢談時局</h3>
<p>中央對粤必要時取有效制裁</p>
<p>北平通訊上海巿長張羣奉蔣主席命北上爲張副司令祝壽於今（三日）午抵平下榻北平飯店記者前往晋謁當承張氏在樓下大客廳接見對時局各項問题暢談甚久茲誌其談話於下</p>
<p>北來任務兄弟此次係奉蔣主席命來平爲張副司令祝壽當離京時蔣主席并接到副司令抱病消息遂并囑兄北兼問病况至今晨過津時見報戴始知副司令已入醫院靜養想副司令前此晋京出席國民會議因南方天氣不佳時常下雨或受感冒更以一路往返勞頓所致但此種流行病略加靜養即可痊愈兄弟此來除祝壽並問病外别無其他任務現何時晋謁副司令尚未决定</p>
<p>粤事經過廣東事件在國民會議開幕前旬日京中即發生種種謠言謂廣東方面準備於國議開幕時對中央有不利之舉動同時廣東省主席陳銘樞亦來電報告被逼赴港當時中央認爲過去削平叛逆犧牲甚大剛得到和平統一之目的而且全國國民盼望和平與統一之切自不至再有人出來破壞故認爲绝對是謠言至四月三十日得到古應芬陳濟棠等發出通電始信爲事實按陳濟棠身爲革命軍人當以服從爲天職自不不應妄加干涉中央接到此電後猶認爲是一種誤會當由監察委員會去電解釋一切藉得明瞭所有來往電文多已登載各地報纸想諸位可以見着據廣東方面希望以爲在國民會議開幕前忽來當頭一捧</p>
<p>便可以阻礙各地代表入京出席於是國議就不得開成豈知事實上適得其反且各地代表因此尤更形團结全體代表除廣西有特殊情形未及參加外其餘完全出席不過粤事發生後對外交問題則微有影響原本中央决定在國議開幕前將一切不平等條約及領事裁判權完全撤銷嗣以此事關係稍爲停頓惟粤方内部確甚複雜彼此絶不融洽即以古應芬孫科兩人而言前此於國務會議席上因開闢中山港問題曾發生重大齟齬幾至用武後經蔣主席居間調解始告平息况現在廣東欲將各派合冶一爐試問能否推誠相見即如去年之北平擴大會議亦閙出許多笑話諸位可以過去之事證諸今日即可窺見一斑况現在廣東方面之苟合尚不如去年擴大會議之集會相信無多大能力充其景言之亦不過搗亂而已</p>
<p>中央態度至中央方面截至現在止仍抱定和平解决辦法希望彼等能自已覺悟以免徒苦人民設使彼等必不悔禍而甘心破壞和平則中央以迫不得已亦只有採取有效制裁之必要手段總而言之中央對粤事靜待其最後之覺悟而已</p>
<p>調解情形此外張溥泉先生日前赴粤調解亦即宣逹中央尊重和平之意旨且張先生係酷愛和平之一人甚望此事不至擴大故不辭勞瘁親自前往然以粤中份子複雜無人負責恐不能得相當結果而張先生希望彼等能翻然覺悟雖明知無濟於事亦姑且一行以求萬一蓋亦中央各位同志自始至終抱定以和平解决爲前提現聞張先生日内即可返京報告</p>
<p>胡李近况廣東方面此次擴拾浮言借題發揮其所提片面之詞爲胡漢民先生在京行動不能自由此與事實大昧蓋胡先生辭職後以身體違和遂在寓休養日前且有電去粤勸以愛護黨國注重和平其行動極爲自由不但中央各同志可以往見即日前國議開幕時各位代表曾往訪數次均隨便唔談並無加以若何限制胡先生在黨國資望甚深言行致其主張雖有特别之處亦是胡先生别有高見此爲尋常之事胡以避免各方包圍故不願於此時他適恐有毁其革命之歷史其實胡先生即要他去中央亦任其所之决不稍加干涉何得謂之行動不能自由其次如李濟深先生早已移居私宅休養更不受若何拘束</p>
<p>勦匪問題中央對勦匪問題不受任何影響仍本原定計劃繼續進勦現大軍雲集贛省徹底肅除决不因粤事而稍加廢弛日來調動大軍包勦即求於短期内肅清此事可不在問題</p>
<p>王吳行踪王寵惠院長現仍在滬日内將放洋出席海牙國際法庭會議在放洋前擬赴京一次至吳鐵城先生則因公來往京滬當兄弟離京前尚在上海此時或已返京最後張謂此來原定稍留數日即行返京現以副司令在院養病須俟晤面時轉逹蔣主席祝壽及問安之意後再定離平行期至北平繁榮問題亦擬順便與胡巿長等略爲交换意見至中央全體會議開幕日期尚未决定俟中常會討論後方能决定云云（中央社）</p>

<h3>鐵餅華人意外失敗</h3>
<p>鐵餅成績平平而已十六人中出色者少三二米八三王季淮陳寳球皆可造成此數二人擲來最遠皆僅三○米左右裁判沈昆南說他的上塲慌張餅出太高落點遂近起初德人克拉麥三二米餘只見挿着德國旗餘者望旗生嘆托墨斯基雖然進出公開資格而計分王陳最後一次依然失望可謂意外損失而却賓部最後一擲而得第一眞是運氣</p>
<h3>跳遠决賽眞眞氣人</h3>
<p>跳遠最後五分鐘前尚全部爲華人包辦一二三四五統统華人王季淮以六米四○領前豈知史璜克第六次一跳竟以六米四六追出王季准此○六米使華人全功盡棄成績尚可</p>
<h3>李仲三跳高擔心事</h3>
<p>十五人跳高漸漸淘汰李琳一米六八穏坐第五名再加顧或跳過一米七二坐第四名李仲三安特生及日本古川爭前三名至一米七六李仲三過去古川亦過安特生第三次亦過再加函一、</p>
<p>米八二如能過去則爲全國新紀綠李先跳不過去無不擔心古川安特生亦不過去大爲安慰於是低下一格爲五呎十一時李不過去古川二人亦不過去再退下至五呎十時李過去古安失敗李遂膺冠軍五呎八時古（一跳）川失敗安特生得第二</p>
<h3>四百米接力大可惜</h3>
<p>四百米接力跑華隊人才甚佳一棒鍾連基超出美國馬列奥許多第二棒周恩德相去更遠白那特望塵莫及可是周送棒與三棒郝春德大不凑手史璜克一躍居先林興已無法追湯史雷矣甚爲惜</p>
<h3>談談短距離之預賽</h3>
<p>百米二百米湯史雷寫寫意意跑第一名一面看着第二名跑成績亦最佳决賽十分八九可得第一四百米湯不出力僅爭一位置預備蓄銳林光興未曾特色或許預賽之故周恩德二百米萬一有希望顧再平百米第三組得第三到終點抽筋倒地二百米棄權短距離華人眞要努力否則危平殆哉高欄史璜克古川不可不妨</p>
<h3>女子表演</h3>
<p>英美女子大顯威風</p>
<p>中國紀綠都爲打倒</p>
<p>孫桂雲卡菊年非其敵手</p>
<p>女子表演共計五項五十米百米四米接力跳遠跳高預决賽結果英美女子全部冠軍無一不超過中國紀綠試比較之</p>
<p>中國紀綠大會紀綠</p>
<p>五十米吳梅仙秒三湯姆生七秒二一百米孫桂雲十三秒八湯姆生十三秒三跳遠卞菊年四六白那特四米五九跳高朱天眞一米二九白那特一米三八四百米接力北隊五八秒美國隊五七秒八　五十米預賽共二組湯姆生及飛克托同以七秒二各得第一湯起脚尚嫌慢否則成績不可想張蘋先盛璧僅得立置</p>
<p>一百米預賽二組冠軍仍爲飛克托及湯姆生湯姆生成績爲十三秒三無落别人五六米張蘋先百米棄權</p>
<p>跳遠白那特最低最低成績爲四米四五湯姆生亦四米四五伊們脚步未量看準跳來即得此遠度平日熱練可知</p>
<p>跳高白那特與湯姆生爭第一白那特過一米三八湯姆生未過遂屈居第二白跳來極鬆快之至中國女子夢想亦不及</p>
<p>四百米接力馬毓芳錢行素第一第二棒皆超出美葡之前第三棒張一鳴絆倒跑道立起再跑張蘋先是落於第三名地位矣</p>

<h3>續誌潔癖</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>生有潔癖而又饒奇趣者以余所稔得三人焉較之石顏也君所述殆有過之而無不及爰列舉於下以博一噱</p>
<p>友人程君有戚曰老小姐者年事已老猶是深閨未字人故人咸以老小姐呼之老小姐生有潔癖其閨中之清潔運動恒躬自任之弗喜假手僕役凡床榻几案之問務使其凈無纎塵如有客偶入其室無論性别迨其人旣去其所坐之椅凳必從事揩拭至再至三至飲過之茶盃洗滌更不待言人知其怪僻亦鮮有問津者老小姐嘗謂世間男女多齷龊故矢志不嫁寗以丫角終云</p>
<p>南巿有吕君年逾耳順生平亦具潔癖其對於飲食尤特别注意凡戚友酒食酬應輒行謝絶海上餐館雖林立罕有其足跡蓋恐飲食之不潔也渠謂惟西餐尚差强人意但其光顧西餐館也仿入境問俗之義必先問廚房在何處親臨參觀觀其佈置是否適宜而清潔合則留不合則掉首而去更赴他館亦如之雖跋涉長途弗辭也故北巿西餐館之廚房孰者清潔而合於衛生孰者否渠一一瞭如指掌至其他雜牌餐館之廚房則謂不值一盼趨避且不遑尚何朶頣之足快如此精細之吃客實所罕見也又君曾對余言渠處處講究衛生宜可以却病魔而入康莊但仍一生多病殊難索解余亦笑而答</p>
<p>余友任君供職首都某機關有同事某君素抱獨身主義且有奇癖平日喜御新襪凡襪衹穿一次稍汚輒棄如敝　不再洗滌更换其室隅置有一簍其棄下之襪恒纍纍如小邱聞多給興其浣衣之婦一歲所費頗不資故人咸稱之爲襪大王云</p>

<h3>黃海環遊記（二四）</h3>
<p>— 黃炎培</p>
<p>四月二十二日從神户上船回國了過長畸泊兩小時即行回國了這時候所遺留於吾腦海的只有幾點</p>
<p>（一）日本是能把西方新文化來繼續發揮東方舊文化的所以一方表現出他們狠大的吸收量同時那一方又表現出他們狠堅强的保守性</p>
<p>（二）日本現在的地位也狠危險兩大財閥對抗的形勢早已造成各顯其神通來運用他們憑財力所造成的兩大政黨作政治舞臺上的苦鬥遇到利害共同的地方像對付産黨無産黨則又臨時團结起來於是勞資兩方的對抗愈激而愈烈他們國民的吸收量來得大同時敎育又比較普及所以他們所謂思想問題不是靠高壓力或小小補苴方法可以解决的他們人口增加的速率狠大自從不景氣問題發生更促進他們思想上的變化而對於國外大家注目於蘇俄五年實業計劃完成以後東方商業上經濟上的影響狠想搶先地來解决而不可抗的震災問題幾年一小震幾十年一大震在他種民族或不免因此發生思想上的悲鬰與頽廢而他們反以激起其進取心但聞亦有一部分人的人生觀因此發生變化者這都是他們國内現時實况與待解决的問題</p>
<p>（三）因上述的種種得到一個結論早自然而然地成爲全國上下一致的趨向就是向外發展軍閥資本家的野心是不用說了政治家以爲要减免竪的勞資階級問題的糾結惟有利用橫的國家思想來抉破他至於人口問題經濟問題乃至天災問題無非是長沙地小不足迥旋對症下藥惟有向外發展向外發展向那一方面發展呢除掉吾們中國還有誰呢過去的鼓吹日美戰爭呀現在的鼓吹日蘇戰爭呀何常有仇於美而有恨於蘇呢所爭就爲吾們中國罷了不過他們的目標比從前還要擴大從前爲的是满蒙現在呢黃河以北全是他們　涎所及哩</p>
<p>吾們旣然知道了日本現在和未來那麽吾們自已該來商量一下</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>

<h3>Important Domestic Telegrams: Commander-in-Chief Chiang to Depart Soon to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Resting at Tangshan Yesterday</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chiang is scheduled to go to Jiangxi soon to suppress bandits. He Yaozu, Yang Jie, and Zhou Fohai will accompany him. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chairman Chiang left for Tangshan with his entourage on the afternoon of the 6th to rest. Dai Jitao went to Baohua Mountain on the 5th to rest. The Panchen Lama also left Tangshan for Baohua Mountain on the morning of the 5th to recuperate. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Nanchang: Chiang believes that the bandits are becoming more rampant and has decided to come to Jiangxi to personally supervise the suppression. All sectors are preparing to welcome him and have telegraphed to Nanjing to inquire about his travel date. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Message to the National Army</h3>
<p>Vowing to Fight to the Death to Suppress the Red Bandits</p>
<p>Completing My Long-Held Wish, I Shall Retire to My Farm</p>
<p>Nanjing: The General Headquarters announced on the 6th the original text of Commander-in-Chief Chiang's message to the National Army before departing to suppress the bandits:</p>
<p>Deputy Commander Zhang, Commanders, Army Commanders, Division Commanders, to All Officers and Soldiers:</p>
<p>Before setting out to suppress the communists in Jiangxi, my heart is filled with national humiliation and hatred for the party. I have many urgent hopes for all of you, my comrades-in-arms, both public and private, and there is much I cannot refrain from saying. Since the revolution has not yet been completed and the red disaster is still rampant, the Central Government, in accordance with the resolutions of the National Convention and the demands of the national public opinion, has made the greatest determination to gather the strength of the whole country to eliminate this national crisis and complete the revolution. I, Chiang Chung-cheng, have been entrusted by the Party and the nation to supervise the military. I deeply believe that this is a critical moment for the country's safety and a time for my comrades to serve the nation. I would like to express my sincere feelings to encourage everyone. All of you, my comrades-in-arms, must share the same hatred and eliminate this morning meal to fulfill the duty to the Party and the nation as revolutionary soldiers. I, Chiang Chung-cheng, believe that all the soldiers of our country today should have an unwavering determination to meet the arduous mission of this era. The following two points must be clearly recognized and firmly believed:</p>
<p>First, eliminate civil war and ensure unity. The unified situation that the country has today has been achieved by sacrificing the blood of countless soldiers and martyrs. We should learn from our pain and always remember the tragedy of the martyrs who died and the suffering of the compatriots in the war zone. We should do our utmost to ensure the unity and peace of the country and thoroughly relieve the people of their suffering. Therefore, the army already formed by the country should devote all its efforts to suppressing bandits. Otherwise, it will never fight against armies within the country, indulging in the ridicule of internal strife and mutual killings, creating opportunities for the red bandits, and leaving endless disasters for the nation. This is why the Central Government, regardless of everything, has decided to eliminate the red bandits as the only urgent task. I, Chiang Chung-cheng, hope that all of you, my comrades-in-arms, have a deep understanding of this.</p>
<p>Second, suppress the red bandits and ensure the safety of society. The National Convention has passed a resolution that the state should give special care and guarantee to the troops who have contributed to the suppression of bandits. If our soldiers contribute to the suppression of bandits, they will naturally be respected by the people. Considering the national defense needs of China and the actual national situation, the government fears that it will not be able to cultivate and enrich the army that has already been formed by the state. How can there be any dismissal? China today does not suffer from poverty but from internal strife. It does not suffer from insufficient finances but from the lack of national unity and unstable local order. With China's vast area, large national defense, large population, and abundant resources, the existing military strength cannot be said to be excessive. If political affairs can be put on track and national strength is abundant, the current military expenditure should not only not be reduced but should also be gradually increased. Today, those who do not observe the facts and advocate the reduction of troops, or create rumors of reorganization and dismissal to make our military uneasy, not only lack revolutionary common sense but also have no national concept. If they are not insane, why would they do this? All of us revolutionary soldiers deeply understand this and will not be deceived. The Central Government, after considering the national situation and weighing the needs, has also clearly determined the major military and political plans, believing that the existing army does not need to be cut, and all of you, my soldiers, have pledged your loyalty to the country, and should strive to be the mainstay of the country for the rest of your lives. This is what I, Chiang Chung-cheng, dare to tell the soldiers of the whole country.</p>
<p>Understanding the above two points, all of you, my soldiers, should know that the situation of revolutionary soldiers today is such that if you can put the country and the nation first, you will not have to worry about self-preservation but will only worry about not being able to serve. The greatest disaster of the nation is the evil red bandits. All of you, my revolutionary and patriotic soldiers, should take it as your duty to eliminate the red bandits. All the troops who are ordered to suppress the bandits should be one against a hundred and ten against a thousand. Even those who are not directly responsible for suppressing the bandits should rest assured to reorganize, intensify training, appease the local area, and restore order so that the bandit suppression troops can concentrate on their tasks without any worries. Moreover, it is not only the active-duty soldiers. All the soldiers who participated in the revolution in the past and left midway can truly understand the importance of the righteousness in this critical moment of national survival, and will not be confused by reactionaries or support the red bandits, support the nation's vitality, and help complete the mission of suppressing the bandits. Then, I, Chiang Chung-cheng, will certainly report to the Central Government in the future to pardon their past mistakes and allow them to be the mainstay of the country. We, who are in the military, should have the sincere patriotism and martial spirit of warriors. How can we allow the red bandits to shake our nation with their stench? This is another self-awareness that we soldiers should all have. Because we soldiers have the duty to defend the country, the reactionary elements who harm the country and the people often want to get our soldiers and are willing to slander, lure, and plot. If we do not firmly believe in our doctrine and absolutely obey the guidance of the Central Government, we cannot avoid the crisis. Looking at the past rebellions, which despicable politicians did not use our soldiers as tools? In the end, they may temporarily seize power and wealth for a while, but the soldiers who were induced will be laughed at by the world forever. And in all previous cases, all those who left the Party and the country and echoed the reactionaries were destroyed, and all those who supported the Central Government and fought hard were successful. I, Chiang Chung-cheng, often think of this and am always wary of the danger of falling into the abyss for my comrades, and I am determined to use myself to guarantee the glorious history of our revolutionary soldiers forever. Recently, the reactionary forces have become more clamorous and have been supporting the bandits. They are like madmen who are accusing me, Chiang Chung-cheng, of relying on my troops to seize power, criticizing me as a military dictator, and denouncing me in every possible way, like poisonous arrows raining down on me. I, Chiang Chung-cheng, have survived hundreds of battles and have experienced many hardships. What else do I want? As far as personal gain is concerned, wouldn't it be better for me to impeach myself and step down? The reason why I am enduring humiliation and have not dared to leave is simply because the national humiliation has not been wiped out, the doctrine has not been implemented, the blood of the martyrs has not dried, and the legacy of the Premier has not been fulfilled. I sincerely believe that revolution is a responsibility, not a right, and I cannot give up my responsibility to the country and the nation. I am also convinced that if I, Chiang Chung-cheng, give in to the reactionary faction's plot because of impatience and self-defeating, then the suffering of the soldiers and the people will be ten times greater than it is today, and the destruction of the country and the nation will not only leave us alive with no place to stand, but the martyrs and the fallen soldiers will also have no place to bury their bones. I, Chiang Chung-cheng, deeply remember the heavy entrustment of the Premier and the tragic death of the martyrs and the fallen soldiers in the past. Even if there are ten or a hundred times more insults and persecutions than today, I can only bear it with pleasure. As long as there is a breath left, I will never lightly abandon my duties and leave my comrades without protection, and the revolutionary cause will be interrupted. I am about to depart for Hubei and Jiangxi to supervise the armies in encircling and suppressing the red bandits. I trust in the spirit of the Premier, the help of the people, and the loyalty and hard work of all the officers and soldiers. I will surely be able to clear the bandit disaster in the shortest possible time and stabilize the country and the nation. Fortunately, after completing this long-cherished wish, I will surely retire to my farm to express my feelings. However, soldiers pledge their lives to the country. If they fail to succeed, they must become benevolent. If I, Chiang Chung-cheng, give my life on the battlefield and follow the Premier and all the martyrs and soldiers in the underworld, then I only hope that all of you, my comrades-in-arms, will always recognize the bright road that I, Chiang Chung-cheng, have pointed out and never be tools for reactionary politicians to make my comrades kill each other. I also hope that all of you, my comrades-in-arms, will fight to the death to suppress the red bandits, continue to fulfill my legacy, fight for justice for the martyrs, and eliminate the great harm to the nation to show the true spirit of us Chinese revolutionary soldiers to the world. All these words are spoken with all my heart and are not meant to be said to outsiders, nor are they worthy of being said to outsiders. I am sincerely asking all of you, my soldiers, who have shared life and death and hardships for many years. You can regard this as the instruction of your superior, or as the announcement of your brothers in the family, or even as my will. There is nothing wrong with sacrificing your life to serve the country. All of you, my soldiers, should work together to put it into practice. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>The Central Government Will Not Easily Start a War with Guangdong</h3>
<p>Chiang's Speech to the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>Zhang Ji Scheduled to Leave Guangdong for Shanghai on the 8th</p>
<p>Nanjing: During a luncheon with all members of the Legislative Yuan on the 5th, Chairman Chiang said that since the Guangdong incident, there have been many speculations and alarms, but in reality, there is not much of a problem. The Guangdong incident is just a dispute over party affairs and politics, and the Central Government is more than capable of dealing with it. Therefore, the Central Government adheres to the spirit of peace and will not easily start a war. If unfortunately a war does occur, the Central Government can also restrain it. However, the only enemy of China today is the red bandits. If we give the red bandits another opportunity to take advantage of, then not only will it affect our Party in the future, but the Chinese nation will inevitably perish. The Central Government is now determined to do its utmost to eliminate the red bandits. Shao YuanChong and Wang Yongbin, among others, stood up and recounted the years of suppressing rebellions, maintaining the prestige of China, and preserving the glorious history of our Party. However, the country and the people have suffered a lot due to the suppression of rebellions. They hoped to avoid all wars in the future and that all political disputes would be resolved through law. However, the law itself is extremely hollow, so if the law is to be effective, it must be jointly observed by the people of the whole country. They hoped that Chairman Chiang would abide by the national laws with the spirit of suppressing rebellions in the past and be a role model for the 400 million people. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chairman Chiang told people that the Guangdong incident was purely a matter of party affairs and that appropriate solutions should be sought within the scope of party affairs. If party affairs were to undermine peace, corrupt local areas, and create opportunities for the red bandits, causing unexpected harm to the country and the people, it would be tantamount to self-destruction. What fate could the Party escape between heaven and earth, etc. General observers believe that there is still a chance for a peaceful resolution to the Guangdong incident. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: A certain committee member talked about the situation in Guangdong. The situation was quite relaxed a few days ago, but after the nine generals telegraphed to Sun Ke, they were slightly critical, causing a certain important person in Shanghai to still contain a peaceful discussion in his telegraphic tone, not wanting to see it turn to force. This side replied that the generals' criticism was directed at Sun personally and was by no means the intention of the Central Government, so it had nothing to do with the contact steps. This reason was still telegraphed from Shanghai by a certain important person. It is roughly estimated that a certain president will wait for the next telegram to arrive before returning to the north after the completion of the contact. In short, the peaceful path is gradually widening, and Guangdong has suffered the pain of easy initiation and difficult recovery, so it has a closer meaning with the Central Government. The original plan for the supplementary candidates for the various ministries has been temporarily suspended in order to show some courtesy to the departed members and still hope for their return. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Wu Tiecheng went to Shanghai on the evening of the 5th. At the station, he told reporters that Zhang Ji's mediation in Guangdong had yielded good results. He was scheduled to leave Guangdong for Shanghai on the 8th and return to Nanjing to discuss specific solutions with the Central Government. He himself decided to return to Nanjing with Zhang and then schedule a trip to the north. (Central News Agency Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>Russia and Germany's Diligent Struggle</h3>
<p>No country in the world has achieved great success without struggling through extremely difficult and dangerous periods. Especially in difficult and dangerous periods, there must be a continuous spirit of struggle to get rid of the difficulties and enter a safe environment. In this continuous struggle, even if the situation is extremely difficult, we must recognize that it is our own responsibility and not rely on friendly countries. Internal disturbances must be dealt with calmly, and external pressures or obstacles to our policies must also be overcome with this resolute spirit, without any fear. Over time, friendly countries will see that they can save themselves and that they can strive to overcome the environment. Those who are close to us will be happy to help, and even those who are alienated and opposed to us will be willing to cooperate in order to achieve mutual benefit. This is not the power of friendly countries. Only by helping oneself can people be happy to help, and only by self-rescue can people be happy to save. This is the public example of the world. Russia and Germany are the countries with the most difficult and dangerous situations in the world, and they are also the countries with the most diligent struggle. However, today, they have almost overcome the environment. Russia's New Economic Policy has the hope of success, so many countries are preparing to join hands with it to trade. Although German government officials still say that they have not escaped the crisis, it can be seen that all industries have been revived and have reached the point of recovery. Today, the joint visit of the German Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Britain is already a sign of friendship. It can be said that it is the result of diligent struggle. It is futile to seek external success without this effort.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Condition</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Fever Graduatedly Receded</p>
<p>Chiang Wired to Express His Condolences</p>
<p>Beiping: Zhang Xueliang's temperature today is still 38 degrees, and his pulse is 77. Every day, he follows the doctor's orders and only drinks milk, not eating other foods. Chiang Kai-shek is very concerned and wires to Ping every day to express his condolences. The headquarters also reports the condition to Nanjing by telegram every day. Li Shizeng brought a Chinese medicine doctor from Nanjing and plans to introduce him to Zhang for diagnosis. Zhang Xueming told reporters that the Deputy Commander's condition is improving day by day. The most feared thing about this kind of disease is sudden increase and decrease in temperature. According to the situation in recent days, the temperature has been decreasing slightly every day, which is a very good sign. It seems that he will recover in one or two weeks. Anyone who visits Zhang must be allowed by the doctor to see him through the window. Zhang's private residence number is now also moved into the hospital. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Zhang Xueliang specially ordered all the generals to return to their defenses immediately to focus on official duties because his lifespan has passed and his illness is not very serious. The Deputy Headquarters announced that Zhang's condition yesterday was indeed in a better state than the previous day. It is heard that today is slightly better than yesterday. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Beiping: The family members of the staff of the seven departments of the Deputy Headquarters arrived in Ping from Shenyang by special train tonight. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Shenyang: Ye Biliang telegraphed to report that Zhang suffered from a cold from noon on the 30th night and was diagnosed by a German doctor. For the sake of recuperation, he entered the Xiehe Hospital on the 1st, which was not very urgent. He will be discharged from the hospital in three or four days. He was told to inform all circles. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Chiang that his illness has slightly improved and he is deeply grateful for his condolences. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>He Yingqin and Others Persuade Gu, Chen, and Sun by Telegram</h3>
<p>Nanchang: He Yingqin, etc. telegraphed that all newspapers should be informed that Gu Wen, the Chief of Civil Affairs, Chen Bonan, the Commander-in-Chief, and Sun Zhesheng, the Minister, had recently sent a telegram to Guangzhou, saying that at the beginning of the Guangdong incident, Yingqin and others were afraid of the spread of the communist disaster and were saddened by the division of the country. They cried and told them to accept good words. How could they have imagined that their emotions would be frustrated, their relatives and enemies would be reversed, and they would drink poison without remorse, accelerating their own demise? The red bandit forces have already spread like wildfire. Without the combined efforts of the whole country and a desperate struggle, there is almost no hope of extinguishing them. There is no affinity with the bandits and no hatred with the country. They directly and indirectly provide assistance to them. You have always taken bandit suppression as your duty, but you have become alienated from those who harbor bandits. You have added an arrow to the Party and the country. This is what we are greatly puzzled about. Recently, you have made strange arguments, saying that you are resisting the Central Government on the one hand and striving for bandit suppression on the other. May I ask if the tablet of the Holocaust in Yangcheng has been hidden at the expense of its traces? The troops blocking and suppressing the bandits in eastern Guangdong have also been withdrawn to Guangzhou. Obviously, they are willing to be the vanguard and backing of the red bandits, but they are still using the sympathy for bandit suppression to cover up their crimes and shirk their responsibilities. How can the world deceive them completely? They have no love for the Party and the country, and they have always been in collusion with the red bandits. How can the two brothers be so painful that they are willing to abandon their propositions, Dong Xuan, and the same utensils? I hope that the two brothers will distinguish between relatives and enemies and alleviate the disaster of the Divine Land. I am so worried that I do not know what to say, etc. He Yingqin, He Chengjun, He Jian, Lu Dipin, Zhu Shaoliang, Wang Jinyu, Sun Lianzhong, and Xu Yuanquan bowed together. (Special Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>German Authorities Arrive in London</h3>
<p>Seeking to Resolve Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Emergency Decree Simultaneously Announced</p>
<p>People's Taxes Increased</p>
<p>Officials Strictly Reduced Salaries</p>
<p>Brüning Claims</p>
<p>Solving Germany's Problems</p>
<p>Depends on Friendly Assistance</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: Dr. Brüning, the German Chancellor known for his silence who commanded the stormtroopers during the European War and received the Iron Cross, arrived in London today with Foreign Minister Dr. Curtius. This is the first official visit of a German government leader since the war. British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Henderson, and others personally greeted them at Waterloo Station. Many Germans welcomed them at the station, and the cheers rose as soon as the German Chancellor got off the train. The British Prime Minister stepped forward to shake hands with him sincerely. After talking for a while, Brüning and others got into cars and drove towards the hotel. The leaders of the British and German governments will have informal talks at the end of this week, and the most important issue to be discussed will naturally be the reparations issue, which is not only related to European general politics. Tonight, Dr. Brüning told international journalists that the purpose of this visit is to discuss, with an honest and peaceful attitude, the many difficulties encountered by the world, especially the budgetary and economic difficulties encountered by Germany. He will be a guest at the British Prime Minister's villa at the end of this week and ask for British assistance to Germany, which is currently facing economic and industrial difficulties. The German Chancellor then said that he feared that listeners would misunderstand the independent actions of Britain and Germany, and immediately turned to say that Germany's problems could not be solved without large-scale cooperation throughout the world. The German Chancellor also said that the German government is now planning to increase new taxes and vigorously reduce expenditures. Since the Young Plan reduced reparations payments by 700 million marks, Germany has not only not reduced taxes, but has been forced to increase taxes and reduce expenses by 250 million marks within fourteen months. Although the Young Plan has reduced reparations, it still imposes an impossible burden on Germany. Germany's difficulties have reached their limit. No government can use continuous tax increases as a good strategy, and Germany's radicalism continues to develop. If Germany relies only on itself, it will never be able to solve its difficulties. It can only rely on the honest cooperation of all countries in the world, etc. The Chancellor solemnly stated in slow English the difficult situation in Germany. Many believe that Dr. Brüning has an idea that temporarily suspending reparations payments is not enough to cope with the current situation, and reparations must be reduced forever before it is possible. He believes that the rise in gold prices over the past three years is clear proof that Germany's actual burden is increasing.</p>
<p>The National Society, Berlin, 6th: Today, the German government announced an emergency decree and simultaneously issued a proclamation stating that the weight of taxation has reached its maximum limit, but in order to maintain the country's ability to repay its debts, the people must endure this new burden. Then, it repeatedly stated the government's efforts to economize and vigorously manage the unfounded extravagance, and finally claimed that Germany had made every effort to fulfill the obligations caused by the European War. Now the assumptions on which the Young Plan is based have proven to be inconsistent with the facts. Germany's finances and economy have entered a critical period for the unbearable reparations. Waiting for a slight relief and criticism, etc. The emergency decree is a lengthy document that includes various emergency plans that are expected to increase revenue by 1.3 billion marks, such as stipulating that civil servants' salaries will be reduced by another 4% to 8%, increasing income tax, levying an emergency tax from 1% to 5%, moderately reducing the expenses of social welfare agencies and European War pensions, increasing sugar and kerosene taxes, and greatly reducing the expenses of government agencies. The most noteworthy of these is the creation of a 40-hour work week in several industries to reduce unemployment, which can slightly alleviate the hidden worries of the political, economic, and social future. Even newspapers close to the government complained about the heaviness of the burden increased on the people this time. It is said that since the reduction of salaries, the living conditions of the middle class have even regarded purchasing newspapers as a luxury.</p>

<h3>Madman Attacks with Knife</h3>
<p>Wounds Twenty Chinese, Nine British and Japanese</p>
<p>Subdued After Being Scalded with Boiling Water</p>
<p>Perpetrator, a Filipino, Taken into Custody in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Reuters, Eastern Telegraph, 6th: The Changxing Company's Gahou was en route to Yokohama yesterday morning when a Filipino suddenly went mad, killing two Chinese sailors and stabbing twenty-nine others, including several sailors and other passengers in the third-class cabin. The madman wielded a sharp knife and slashed wildly in the corridor, then ran to the main dining room. Fortunately, the passengers were all having breakfast and no one was in the room. The madman avoided pursuers for about half an hour before being subdued by the crew. He was found hiding in a concealed place on the bow. However, no one dared approach him. They took a belt and scalded him with boiling water before he bowed his head and was restrained. It was later found that six people were seriously injured, and three of them were unlikely to survive. They were all taken ashore in Yokohama. The rest were treated on the ship. It is further reported that the injured on the Gahou were twenty Chinese, including two women, two British sailors, and seven Japanese, one of whom is in critical condition. The madman was a third-class passenger named Pilas who boarded in Honolulu. He will now be handed over to the Hong Kong authorities for custody.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegrams from various provincial authorities and newspaper offices:</p>
<p>We have read the sincere telegrams from Minister He, Chairman He, and Chairmen He and Lu to Chen Jitang. The righteousness of the words, the thoroughness of the concerns, and the experienced planning for the country are deeply admirable. Bing, etc., respectfully follow the meaning of the telegrams with utmost sincerity, obey the Party and the country, and support unification. We also send a telegram of advice to Chen Jitang:</p>
<p>To Commander-in-Chief Chen of Guangdong,</p>
<p>We have read the sincere telegrams from Minister He and other gentlemen. The advantages and disadvantages, the gains and losses, the priorities and details for the Party, the country, and Guangdong have been exhaustively articulated, and there is no need for further elaboration. However, the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen. Therefore, Hongshi, etc., will not shy away from ignorance and offer further advice. We hope you will consider it carefully.</p>
<p>We believe that the country has been in turmoil for nearly twenty years. Fortunately, with your prestige, unification has been achieved, and the world is rejoicing. Unexpectedly, the Red disaster is rampant, and the people's livelihood is declining. It has taken months of military operations to begin to turn the tide. Looking at the Central Plains, which has repeatedly suffered disasters, even if we rest and recuperate at this time, we are afraid that it will be difficult to recover quickly. How can we create internal strife again and inflict more suffering on our people? Furthermore, the highest authority belongs to the Party at the founding of the Party and the country. Even if there are suggestions for Party affairs, they can be submitted to the Party for resolution.</p>
<p>Patriotism is like you, and the only way is to resolve differences, immediately stop disputes, advocate harmony, and consolidate unity. Then the country will be as stable as a rock, and glory will be passed on infinitely. Who among our countrymen would not be delighted? If we cannot bear a moment of anger and are bewitched by provocative words, starting with temptation and ending with war, the country will cease to be, and what benefit will you gain? Bing, etc., have served on the frontier for half a lifetime, and as soldiers, at this time of devastation, we share the pain of the country's ruin. We only offer our sincere suggestions and hope they will be adopted for the sake of the overall situation. If you are fortunate, the country will be fortunate, and we, Hongbing, etc., will be fortunate.</p>
<p>The above is respectfully telegraphed for your consideration.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>Zhang Qun Discusses the Current Situation in Beiping</h3>
<p>The Central Government Will Take Effective Sanctions Against Guangdong if Necessary</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun, under the orders of Chairman Jiang, came to Beiping to celebrate Vice Commander Zhang's birthday. He arrived in Beiping at noon today (the 3rd) and stayed at the Beiping Hotel. Reporters went to visit him and were received by Mr. Zhang in the downstairs living room. He spoke at length about various issues regarding the current situation. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<p>Mission to the North: This time, I, as a brother, came to Beiping under the orders of Chairman Jiang to celebrate Vice Commander Zhang's birthday. When leaving Nanjing, Chairman Jiang also received news that Vice Commander Zhang was ill, so he instructed me to inquire about his condition in the North. It was only when I saw the newspaper in Tianjin this morning that I learned that the Vice Commander had been admitted to the hospital for recuperation. I suspect that the Vice Commander fell ill during his visit to Nanjing to attend the National Convention, due to the poor weather in the South and the constant rain, or perhaps he caught a cold and was exhausted from the journey. However, this kind of common illness can be cured with a little rest. My purpose here is solely to celebrate the birthday and inquire about the illness, nothing else. It has not yet been decided when I will visit the Vice Commander.</p>
<p>The Course of Events in Guangdong: In the ten days before the opening of the National Convention, various rumors circulated in Nanjing, saying that the Guangdong side was preparing to take unfavorable actions against the Central Government at the opening of the convention. At the same time, Chen Mingshu, Chairman of Guangdong Province, also sent a telegram reporting that he was being forced to go to Hong Kong. At that time, the Central Government believed that the sacrifices made to quell the rebellions in the past had been great, and that the goal of peace and unification had just been achieved. Moreover, the people of the whole country were eagerly hoping for peace and unification, and no one would want to come out again to undermine it. Therefore, it was believed that the rumors were absolutely unfounded. It was not until April 30 that telegrams were received from Gu Yingfen, Chen Jitang, and others that the Central Government began to believe that the rumors were true. As a revolutionary soldier, Chen Jitang should have taken obedience as his duty and should not have interfered rashly. After receiving this telegram, the Central Government still believed that it was a misunderstanding and instructed the Supervisory Committee to send a telegram to explain everything, hoping to clarify the situation. Most of the telegrams exchanged have been published in newspapers everywhere, so I think you can read them. According to the Guangdong side, they hoped that a sudden blow before the opening of the National Convention could prevent representatives from all over the country from entering Nanjing to attend the convention, thus preventing the convention from being held. Who knew that in fact, it had the opposite effect, and the representatives from all over the country became even more united. All the representatives, except for Guangxi, which had special circumstances and could not participate in time, attended completely. However, the Guangdong incident had a slight impact on foreign affairs. Originally, the Central Government had decided to completely abolish all unequal treaties and consular jurisdiction before the opening of the National Convention, but this matter was temporarily suspended due to this incident. However, the internal affairs of Guangdong are indeed very complicated, and they are not harmonious with each other at all. Take Gu Yingfen and Sun Ke as an example. Previously, at a meeting of the State Council, they had a major dispute over the issue of opening Zhongshan Port, almost to the point of using force. It was only after Chairman Jiang mediated that the matter was settled. Moreover, now Guangdong wants to merge all factions into one furnace. I wonder if they can truly trust each other. Just like the Beiping Enlarged Conference last year, many jokes were made. You can see a glimpse of the current situation by examining the events of the past. Moreover, the current makeshift coalition in Guangdong is not even as good as the assembly at the Enlarged Conference last year. I believe they don't have much ability. To put it bluntly, they are just making trouble.</p>
<p>The Central Government's Attitude: As for the Central Government, it still adheres to a peaceful solution as of now, hoping that they can come to their senses and avoid causing suffering to the people. If they are determined not to repent and are willing to undermine peace, then the Central Government will have no choice but to take necessary and effective sanctions. In short, the Central Government is waiting for their final awakening regarding the Guangdong issue.</p>
<p>Mediation Efforts: In addition, Mr. Zhang Puquan went to Guangdong a few days ago to mediate, which was also to convey the Central Government's intention to respect peace. Moreover, Mr. Zhang is a person who deeply loves peace and hopes that this matter will not escalate, so he personally went there despite his fatigue. However, because the elements in Guangdong are complicated and no one is responsible, I am afraid that a satisfactory result cannot be obtained. Although Mr. Zhang knows that it is useless, he will still go in the hope of a miracle, because all the comrades in the Central Government have adhered to the premise of a peaceful solution from beginning to end. Now I hear that Mr. Zhang will return to Nanjing to report in the next few days.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Hu and Li: The Guangdong side has picked up rumors and made a fuss, claiming that Mr. Hu Hanmin's actions in Nanjing are not free. This is greatly inconsistent with the facts. After resigning, Mr. Hu rested at home due to physical discomfort. A few days ago, he even sent a telegram to Guangdong, advising them to cherish the Party and the country and to pay attention to peace. His actions are very free. Not only can comrades from the Central Government visit him, but also representatives who attended the National Convention visited him several times a few days ago, and they chatted casually without any restrictions. Mr. Hu has a deep reputation in the Party and the country. Although his words and deeds and his opinions may be unique, they are Mr. Hu's own insights. This is a common thing. Hu does not want to be surrounded by all parties, so he is unwilling to go elsewhere at this time, fearing that it will damage his revolutionary history. In fact, even if Hu wants to go elsewhere, the Central Government will let him go and will not interfere in the slightest. How can it be said that his actions are not free? Secondly, Mr. Li Jishen has already moved to a private residence to recuperate and is not subject to any restrictions.</p>
<p>剿匪 Question: The Central Government's bandit suppression is not affected in any way and will continue to advance according to the original plan. The army is now gathered in Jiangxi Province for a thorough suppression and will not be abandoned due to the Guangdong incident. The recent deployment of a large army is aimed at clearing up this matter in the short term, so this is not a concern.</p>
<p>Whereabouts of Wang and Wu: President Wang Chonghui is still in Shanghai and will soon leave for The Hague to attend the International Court of Justice conference. Before leaving, he plans to go to Nanjing once. As for Mr. Wu Tiecheng, he travels back and forth between Nanjing and Shanghai on official business. When I left Nanjing, he was still in Shanghai, and he may have returned to Nanjing by now. Finally, Zhang said that he originally planned to stay for a few days and then return to Nanjing. Now, because the Vice Commander is recuperating in the hospital, he must wait until he meets him to convey Chairman Jiang's birthday wishes and greetings before deciding on the date of departure from Beiping. He also plans to exchange views with Mayor Hu and others on the issue of Beiping's prosperity. As for the opening date of the Central Plenary Session, it has not yet been decided and will be decided after discussion by the Central Standing Committee. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Fifth Division Commander Hu Zuyu Dies of Injuries</h3>
<p>The Battle of Guangchang</p>
<p>Hu Dies After Being Shot Multiple Times</p>
<p>The Funeral Will Be Held on the 4th</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Fifth Division Commander Hu Zuyu led his troops into Jiangxi last year to encircle and suppress the bandits and communists. He fought from northern Jiangxi to Yiheng, Yihuang, and Nanfeng, traversing thousands of miles and repeatedly capturing famous cities. This time, Zhu Mao fled from Donggu to Ji'an, but failed. Then, they turned to attack Nanfeng and Guangchang. On May 27, Commander Hu personally led a part of the Fifth Division in a fierce battle with the bandit troops of Huang Gonglue and Hu Zhusheng in the vicinity of Guangchang County. Commander Hu took the lead, but as the red bandits became more and more numerous and lost contact before and after, he was surrounded by bandits. Commander Hu charged left and right and was shot by multiple bullets, but he refused to retreat. He was rescued from the encirclement by his orderly under the cover of night and rushed to Nanchang Hospital for treatment. However, due to his serious injuries, he died in Nanchang Hospital on the 3rd of this month. All officers and soldiers of the division and the citizens of Nanchang mourned him. Director He was especially saddened and has telegraphed the central government requesting commendation. The Fifth Division Headquarters issued a notice yesterday, stating that the funeral will be held at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall on the 4th: "Commander Hu Gongzhuo of the Fifth Division engaged in a fierce battle with the red bandits in the Guangchang campaign on May 27. He personally led the front line and fought bravely. He was seriously injured and died in Nanchang Hospital at You Shi (5-7 pm) on the 3rd of this month after ineffective treatment. The remains will be moved to the Zhongshan Memorial Hall that evening, and the funeral will be held at Shen Shi (3-5 pm) on the 4th. This is to inform you." (June 4)</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang's Troops Reorganized as the 10th Division</h3>

<h3>Preliminary Survey Work for Guiding the Huai River</h3>
<p>Establishing Water Level, Flow Rate, and Rainfall Stations</p>
<p>Zhuang Songnan and Others Set Off for Surveying</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Guiding the Huai River Committee has formulated a concrete plan for the Huai River guiding project. The preliminary work focuses on surveying. Zhuang Songfu, the vice chairman, and others have completed the survey of the Hongze Lake area in the lower reaches of the Huai River. If the funds for guiding the Huai River can be raised, construction can begin within this year. The committee recently drilled and tested the soil near Jiangba, pre-set an active dam, and increased the number of survey teams to select a route to the sea from near Matouzhen. Water level stations, flow rate stations, and rainfall stations have been set up at important locations along the upper and lower reaches of the Huai River and its tributaries. Each station is equipped with a recorder to record water volume, flow rate, and rainfall. For example, recording the water level uses a water gauge to measure the direction and height of the water level. The water level is observed and recorded every hour from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm every day. The water level is recorded according to the water level recording table. The flow rate is measured using a flow meter to measure the slope and velocity of the water surface and the condition of the riverbed, and the data is recorded in a table. Rainfall is measured using a rain gauge to measure the duration of rainfall from the start of the rain to the end of the rain. The amount of rainfall is recorded in millimeters and recorded in a table, including the number of rainy days in a month and the total monthly rainfall. The water level stations, flow rate stations, and rainfall stations that have been established include Gaoliangjian, Laozi Mountain, Linhuaitou, Xuyi, Qingyangzhen, Sixian, Wuhe, Linhuaiguan, Mingguang, Dingyuan, Bengbu, Huaiyuan, Zhengyangguan, Luan, Huoshan, Fuyang, Taihe, Sanhejian, Honghekou, Xixian, Shangcheng, Guangshan, and more than 20 other locations. Engineer Gui Yefan of the committee came to Bengbu from the lower reaches of the Huai River yesterday (the 3rd) and set up a water level and rainfall station on the main stem of the Huai River in Hebei, appointing Chen Mingqi as the recorder. In addition, Zhuang Songfu, the vice chairman of the committee, and Xu Shiying, a member, arrived in Bengbu by Jinpu train from Nanjing at 4:00 pm on the 4th. The Bengbu General Chamber of Commerce held a welcome meeting at the private Jianghuai Middle School at 6:00 pm on the same day to show their welcome to Zhuang and others who came to Bengbu to inspect the Huai River, which is related to the national economy and people's livelihood. More than 100 people from all walks of life attended. Sun Yuanfu, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, delivered a welcome speech and expressed his hope for the Huai River guiding project. Zhuang Songfu and Xu Shiying then gave speeches and the meeting dispersed at 8:00 pm. At 9:00 am this morning (the 5th), Zhuang and others took a boat to Wuhe, Xuyi and other places to conduct an on-site survey of the depth and situation of the Huai River. After the completion, they will return to Bengbu immediately. (5th)</p>
<h3>The Management Rights of the Jichang Railway Amidst the Sino-Japanese Conference</h3>
<p>Japanese Representatives Arbitrarily Increase Employee Salaries</p>
<p>Our Railway Authorities Lodge a Protest</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Sino-Japanese railway issue was scheduled to be discussed at the end of last month, but because Gao Jiyi, a key person in charge on our side, remained in Tianjin due to business and did not return, Kimura and other special commissioners from the Japanese side recently traveled to Dayun and then returned to Lushun. Therefore, the date of the meeting has not yet been determined. Guo Xurun, the director of the Jichang and Jidun Railway Bureaus, the special commissioner on our side, went to Beiping a few days ago to meet with Vice Commander Zhang and Chairman Gao to report on the situation discussed by the special commissioners in Shenyang every day and to request instructions on the exact date for the start of the meeting with the Japanese side. As for whether the future of the meeting can achieve a mutually beneficial solution to the long-standing cases of the four railways with loan relations with Japan, it depends on the following two points: First, the people of our country must unite to support the authorities. Second, our responsible special commissioners must identify the scope of negotiation and strive to fight. The people of the Northeast have noticed this and have convened meetings of various groups and schools to determine monitoring methods, issue telegrams to the whole country requesting assistance, warn our special commissioners, and meet with the authorities to state public opinion. However, at the time when the meeting is about to open, the Japanese side has suddenly increased the salaries of employees of the Jichang Railway, which originally had a loan relationship. It is heard that our side has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese side due to the fact that rights and interests are at stake, and has requested instructions from the Transportation Committee. The visit of Guo Xurun, the director of the Jichang Railway Bureau, to Beiping is very related to this matter. It is found that the Jichang Railway's loan relationship with Japan was the beginning of the Eastern Provinces Railway. The Eastern Provinces Railway, such as the Jichang, Jidun, Sitao, Taoang, and Siliu Railways, are all railway assets of the Japanese. After the completion of the Eastern Qing Railway, the Russians wanted to extend the Jichang Railway. Changshun, the General of Jilin, planned to raise funds to build it himself and requested permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the 28th year of Guangxu. Russia still made various demands, so he followed his request and changed to the China Eastern Railway Company to undertake the project. After the Russo-Japanese War, Dagui, the General of Jilin, again planned to build it himself, but the Japanese government again used the pretext of recovering the Xinwan Railway to demand the continuation of the Russian construction. Therefore, on the third day of the third month of the 33rd year of Guangxu, the Sino-Japanese Xinwan Jichang Railway Agreement was established, stipulating that half of the funds needed for the self-managed Jichang Railway in China must be borrowed from the Manchurian Railway Company. This was the beginning of our country borrowing Japanese funds to build railways. The Jichang Railway is 79 miles long, equivalent to 125 kilometers. The first loan was made on October 19th of the 34th year of Guangxu, which is November 12th of the 41st year of Meiji. According to the continued agreement sealed, the South Manchurian Railway Company lent 2.15 million Japanese yen. The second loan was made in October of the 6th year of the Republic of China, which is October of the 6th year of Taisho. According to Article 7 of the South Manchurian Inner Mongolia Treaty agreed between the Chinese and Japanese governments on May 25th of the 4th year of the Republic of China, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Communications, representing the Chinese government, revised the Jichang Railway Loan Contract with the South Manchurian Railway Company. At that time, 4.51125 million Japanese yen was borrowed. After deducting some repayments from the first loan, the combined loan amount was 6.5 million Japanese yen. The actual received price of the loan was 91.50 yen per 100 yen, totaling 4,127,793.75 yen. The loan interest rate was 5 per cent per annum, and the repayment period was 30 years, divided into 40 equal installments. Interest was paid every six months. The management rights of the entire railway belonged to the Chinese government. At that time, due to the outstanding performance of the South Manchurian Railway Company in operating railway business, it was entrusted to direct and manage the business on its behalf during the loan period. Due to the above loan relationship, important officials such as the directors of the three key departments of engineering, accounting, and transportation were all appointed by the Japanese, and one of them was selected as the company representative. However, the salaries of the above officials were to be agreed upon by both parties. Afterwards, Japanese officials took advantage of the situation to control everything, and the rights of our director were almost completely stripped away. Our Chinese employees did not try to resist, and were fooled by the Japanese, only seeking to survive. Although there were a few enlightened staff members who could not fight against them, the railway was only 79 miles long, with an annual turnover of only about 3 million. The simplicity of its business can be seen in general, but the railway has many employees, with about 700 staff and about 200 employees. Road workers are still on the outside, among which Japanese nationals account for</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>a majority. This year, in order to reduce expenditure, our director has strongly advocated reducing the number of employees and is now planning to implement salary reductions to save money. However, not long after, the Japanese side actually unilaterally increased the salaries of Japanese employees. Recently, the Japanese government has been trying to reduce the salaries of its domestic railway employees, and the South Manchurian Railway has also reduced salaries this year. Why is it that the Jichang Railway, which is barely surviving, is being given a raise? Moreover, the contract stipulates that the appointment, removal, promotion, and salary of Chinese and Japanese employees must be agreed upon. The Chinese director proposes the Chinese employees, and the company representative proposes the Japanese employees. It is clearly stipulated. Today's arbitrary salary increase is a violation of the agreement. Therefore, our side has now lodged a serious protest. (June 2)</p>

<h3>Wuhu Quick Dispatch</h3>
<p>Anhui Provincial Government Chairman Chen Diaoyuan has recently repeatedly requested resignation from the central government due to the difficulty of government finances. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, considering the current turbulent situation, deemed it inappropriate to easily make changes and did not approve the request. Therefore, Chen returned to Anhui from Nanjing this morning on a special boat. Military and political circles here received the news and waited at the riverbank this afternoon to meet him.</p>
<p>Wuhu is located on the Yangtze River and is an important trading port. Its market is the leading town in Anhui. However, the land and property in the prosperous streets are mostly owned by Mr. Li Bohang and the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church's purpose is to spread religion, but it extensively buys properties to collect rent for profit. Shops and residences around Jihe Street and Hongqiangyuan are almost entirely controlled by the church. In the past, officials and civilians did not pay attention to this. Recently, the Wuhu County Government, following the provincial government's order to strictly prohibit foreigners and religious groups from purchasing properties, repeatedly notified the church to report the actual numbers in detail for verification and recovery. However, the church delayed and ignored the order. Therefore, yesterday, an official notice was reissued, requiring the church to investigate and report to the county government for registration within ten days, and to notify the merchants and residents renting the church's properties to report themselves for price assessment and gradual sale. Any surplus funds will be used for local public welfare. The third administrative conference of the county held its second general meeting yesterday, resolving to organize the Wuhu County Local Public Property Clearance Committee, collect public welfare donations for electric light poles and wires, and reorganize the county's grain storage, among other matters. The meeting will continue today.</p>
<p>The National Government promulgated the Provisional Constitution on June 1st. Various circles here held a celebration meeting at the Star Film Theater. The County Chamber of Commerce also scheduled a banquet at First Spring at 4 PM today, inviting military leader Brigadier General Wang, various committee members of the Kuomintang, the Chief of Public Security Bureau, the County Magistrate, and the Customs Superintendent to celebrate the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution. Delegates to the National Assembly, Tao Yutang and She Ceqin, were invited to speak about the National Assembly's proceedings.</p>
<p>The boundary dispute between Anhui and Zhejiang provinces involving the four counties of Jixi, Changhua, Xiuning, and Kaihua has been investigated by Anhui, Zhejiang, and the Ministry of Interior. The Executive Yuan recently decided to redraw the boundaries. The Anhui Provincial Government was ordered to comply. The new boundary between Zhejiang's Changhua and Anhui's Jixi should be delineated with the entire Shangtang Village assigned to Zhejiang, the entire Jingzhou Village assigned to Anhui, the Jiling Mountains to the west as the boundary, the Huishiling watershed to the northeast as the boundary, and the Langguangling mountain range in the middle as the boundary. The new boundary line between Anhui's Xiuning and Zhejiang should follow the center of the stream in the Xikengyuan valley. (3rd)</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Exhumation of a Child Bride for Autopsy: Lu, the daughter of Lu A'xiao from Luxiang, Xuedian township, in the 572nd Tu of the 12th district of this county, was married to Qian A'ding's son. Qian's son was a tailor in Hankou. On May 29th, Lu suddenly disappeared without saying goodbye. Her father-in-law suspected she went to her mother's house. However, on the 2nd of this month, her body was found in the Taojiabang River. The families on both sides recovered the body and prepared a coffin for burial, while also telegramming Qian's son to return home. Cao Hongshou, the Tu leader, reported the case to the county court as it involved a death. Yesterday, Prosecutor Du went to the village. Because Lu A'xiao refused to take responsibility for a waiver of autopsy, the coffin was immediately opened for autopsy. The body was already decomposed. The autopsy revealed that she had fallen into the river and drowned, with no injuries. Qian A'ding was ordered to re-coffin and bury the body.</p>
<p>Aftermath of the Competition for the Pacific Factory: The buildings and foundations of the Pacific Soap Factory on Xiaojianshang, west of the city, were previously subject to competition between Shen Guiqing and Tao Yinpu, who were engaged in the rice and wheat business. Initially, it was a civil lawsuit that lasted for half a year without resolution. Subsequently, a brawl occurred, and both parties went to the county court for injury verification, resulting in a criminal prosecution followed by detention. During the court's interrogation, both parties made concessions and withdrew the charges, reverting to civil proceedings. Afterwards, a Mr. Gu filed a complaint with the Suzhou High Court, alleging that the parties involved in the case had bribed officials and requested a thorough investigation to uphold the rule of law. Yesterday, the High Court appointed Prosecutor Jin Henian to investigate the case in Wuxi. A summons was issued in advance to more than ten people involved in the case, including Tao Peiji. After arriving in Wuxi, Prosecutor Jin went directly to the court to open an investigation hearing. Those who were summoned and arrived were Tao Binyu, Lu Tao'an, Shen Guiqing, and Yang Lubing. After careful interrogation, all claimed that they had not engaged in bribery. As a result, each person was ordered to sign the record and instructed to bring the statements to Suzhou for further orders.</p>
<p>Water Police Detectives Seize Guns While Apprehending Bandits: Chen Hanrong, the captain of the Water Police's 2nd District Detective Team, previously received information that bandits were hiding in Wuxing County and had guns hidden in the Shikeng. He immediately reported to District Chief Mao and prepared a document to Wuxing County for investigation. A few days ago, he coordinated with the chief of the Public Security Bureau of that county and rushed to a village about eight miles from the city. They seized a Mauser rifle in an earthen pit. However, the bandits had already fled upon hearing the news. He immediately returned to Wuxi with the firearm yesterday to report and investigate the whereabouts of the remaining bandits.</p>
<p>Illegally Imprisoning His Wife with Iron Chains: Transferred to Hospital for Legal Action: The Public Security Bureau's 4th branch received a report from a woman, Lu Wang, that her daughter, who had married Liu Baozhen, a tea shop owner in Quanting, Huishan, had been imprisoned with iron chains due to Liu's affair. She had suffered injuries all over her body and requested police assistance. Upon receiving the report, the bureau dispatched Patrolman Wang Zhenbin from the 1st police station, along with the Tu leader, to the scene. At the Yilantang, they found Liu Lu locked in a room. Liu Baozhen, along with his shop assistants Mazi A'bing, Lengzi Hui, Bing Jiangbei A'san, and other five people, were taken to the bureau for a brief interrogation before being transferred to the General Bureau. Yesterday, Wang Zhonghu, the chief of the 3rd section, interrogated them and ordered the defendant, Liu Baozhen, to pay 120 silver dollars to send his wife to a mental hospital in Suzhou for treatment. However, the defendant disobeyed and continued to imprison and beat his wife, withholding food. A request was made to transfer the case to the hospital for legal action. During the interrogation, Liu Lu stated that her husband had an affair and claimed she was mentally ill to justify the imprisonment and withholding of food. She also stated that he ordered his assistants to beat her. While speaking, she gesticulated wildly, showing signs of mental instability. The iron chains on her feet had not yet been removed. Liu Baozhen stated that Lu had been ill last year and had gone crazy after recovering. Recently, her condition had worsened, and she often caused trouble outside, so he was forced to lock her up to prevent accidents. Mazi and A'bing stated that they indeed helped with the imprisonment but did not beat her. Chief Wang verified the statements and, since the case had been filed with the county court, ordered that it be transferred to the hospital for legal action.</p>

The bureau chief anticipated the arrival of the letter and dispatched police to check the mail, seizing the letter and sending it to the county government by telephone. It is said that the county government refused to accept it due to the lack of evidence. However, the County Party Rectification Committee opposed the Public Security Bureau's unauthorized arrest of a committee member without notifying the senior party organization.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Boundary Issue Between Jiaxing and Haiyan Counties: The issue of boundary demarcation between Jiaxing and Haiyan counties had been discussed several times, but it was halted due to the public's dissatisfaction. Recently, the county governments of the two counties received an order from the province to reconvene the related villages and experienced gentry on both sides to resolve the issue as soon as possible. On the 4th, the two county governments convened a meeting of the related villages and local figures at Shenbo Town, which is located on the border of Jiaxing and Haiyan, to discuss the matter. After discussion, it was decided that the convenience of agricultural production and sales should be the guiding principle, and the original county boundaries should be the standard. The boundary lines between Dayishiyi village of Jiaxing and Weizi village of Haiyan, as well as Buchun village and Chucun of Haiyan and Dayishiyi, Er villages of Jiaxing, and Dongnan village of Jiaxing and Shuangcun village of Haiyan, will follow the original natural boundaries. If there are any ambiguities due to intertwining boundaries, the village committees of both sides will jointly investigate, make artificial modifications, and establish boundary markers. Both sides agreed to the decision. The fifth district chief of Jiaxing, Zhu Jipan, the sixth district chief of Haiyan, Xu Yizhi, and the representatives of the meeting signed the documents and submitted them to the county for review and approval by the province.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Appeal of the Case of Tang Lianfu's Unexplained Death: After Tang Lianfu, hired by Shen Heshang, a Qing civilian outside the Dananmen, went missing in April of last year, his younger brother Shunfu discovered Tang Lianfu's body in the Lidunfang River two days later. The family's investigation revealed that Shen Heshang was suspected of inciting Qian A'er, Shen Shengchang, and Ni A'jiu to murder Tang. They filed a lawsuit with the county government, requesting investigation and legal action. After the county government examined the body and conducted multiple investigations and interrogations, it was declared that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Shen Heshang and Qian A'er were guilty of Tang Lianfu's unexplained death. Shen A'jiu, Ni A'liu, and Shen Shengchang were still suspects, and further investigation would be conducted. The plaintiff did not accept the verdict and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Hangzhou High Court, which is scheduled to convene on the 12th of this month.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Appeals to Retain Zhejiang Education Commissioner</h3>
<p>But Zhang Daofan Insists on Resigning in Beijing</p>
<p>Zhang Daofan, the Education Commissioner of Zhejiang, had previously submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Education due to the financial difficulties of the provincial education budget. The Ministry of Education believed that Zhejiang's education relied on him to preside over it and did not approve his request. It has now issued an appeal to retain him. The original order is as follows: "Having reviewed the submission, the Commissioner has spared no effort in planning and reorganizing since taking office, and his diligence and outstanding work are deeply valued and relied upon. At present, Zhejiang's education needs to be actively developed to achieve complete success. It is hoped that he will avoid difficulty and not consider resigning. The request to submit his resignation should not be discussed. In addition to submitting a separate document to the Executive Yuan for review and filing, and consulting with the Zhejiang Provincial Government to find ways to raise and distribute overdue education funds to facilitate progress, you are still expected to continue your efforts to emphasize education. This is the order."</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that Mr. Zhang's intention to resign is firm. Fearing that he would not be able to obtain central approval soon, he went to Beijing a few days ago to personally present his resignation in the hope of receiving an early approval.</p>

<h3>Jiang-Zhe Middle School Tennis Championship Title to be Decided Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Shanghai vs. Soochow</p>
<p>Loser's Championship Set for the Day After Johnson Forfeits</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Zhejiang Private Middle School Tennis Tournament. According to the original schedule, the semi-final rematch between Johnson and Yan Chengzhi was scheduled for 8:30 AM, and the final between Soochow and the winner of the Yan Chengzhi group was scheduled for 4:15 PM to determine the championship. However, during the match between Johnson and Yan Chengzhi, Johnson's Western coach, Bu Xun, arrived and claimed that he had just heard news of a dispute in the competition. Although Johnson had won the rematch the day before, he personally felt deeply regretful about the matter, as the distribution of players before and after the game was indeed inappropriate and violated the rules of the tournament. He wished to formally declare his forfeiture to the tournament. The president, Wang Bingjian, believed that since the situation was already a fait accompli and Coach Bu was willing to forfeit to preserve sportsmanship, it was a good thing. Therefore, he ordered the suspension of the match between Yan Chengzhi and Johnson and restored the right to the rematch for Shanghai. The issue of the championship became even more uncertain.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Defeats Yan Chengzhi</h3>
<p>At 4:15 PM in the afternoon, Yan Chengzhi and Shanghai held a rematch at Taowu Stadium. As a result, Shanghai won 3-0 and secured the right to the final.</p>
<p>In the first singles match, Yu Tianguang of Shanghai faced Dai Guangjin of Yan Chengzhi. Yu, known for his prowess in Shanghai, had a good chance of winning, but he was too aggressive and made many mistakes. He lost the second set due to this. Dai was careful and cautious, but still lost the third set. It was an unavoidable fate. The referee was Ni Guoliang. The score was as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Yu Tianguang 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 Yan Chengzhi Dai Guangjin</p>
<p>In the second singles match, Xu Zenrui of Shanghai faced Huang Hanzhu of Yan Chengzhi. Huang Hanzhu's performance was lackluster. Xu Zenrui's effective attacks were the foundation of his victory. The referee was Huang Bingjian.</p>
<p>Shanghai Xu Zenrui 4-6, 6-0, 6-0 Yan Chengzhi Huang Hanzhu</p>
<p>In the third singles match, Xu Zengguang of Shanghai faced Zhu Zichang of Yan Chengzhi. The strengths of the two sides were comparable. The score fluctuated in each game, also very close. However, Xu's ball was low and moving, making it difficult to defend. He was defeated as a result. The referee was Mei Naikui.</p>
<p>Shanghai Xu Zengguang 4-6, 6-7, 7-5 Yan Chengzhi Zhu Zichang</p>
<h3>Championship Awaits Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The championship match is now scheduled for 4 PM on Monday at Taowu. The participants in the final are Soochow and Shanghai. The championship match has been changed to the 9th.</p>
<h3>Mai Ling's Second Team Won the Baseball Game Yesterday Against Zhonghua</h3>
<p>Thirteen to Six</p>
<p>The baseball game between Mai Ling's second team and the Zhonghua team at Zhonghua Baseball Field yesterday resulted in a 13-6 victory for Mai Ling.</p>
<h3>First Day of the International Games</h3>
<p>The United States Shows Strong Momentum... China Still Has Hope</p>
<p>British and American Women Are Impressive... Chinese Records Are Shaken</p>
<p>The competition started at 2:30 PM this afternoon and the awards ceremony and closing ceremony will be held at 5 PM.</p>
<p>The International Games' first day of competition saw the United States take the lead with 39 points, but the Chinese team still has a great chance. The women's performances by British and American women were excellent. Yesterday, Chinese women broke five Chinese records. The spectators were not very crowded. The weather was cloudy and slightly rainy later. The military band did not arrive, making the whole venue quiet. The 15 final events will continue at 2:30 PM this afternoon, and the awards ceremony and closing ceremony will be held at 5 PM.</p>
<h3>Championship Situation</h3>
<p>The Chinese Team Has a Great Chance</p>
<p>Efforts Only Needed in Sprints</p>
<p>Although the United States took the lead in points yesterday with 39 to 28, a closer examination of the situation shows that the Chinese team still has much hope. Here is a breakdown:</p>
<p>The Dominance of Field Events Will be Decided Today: In the final events today, Cao Yu and Li Lin in the pole vault against Schwank and Anderson, Chen Baoqiu in the shot put against Tueruo (11.31 meters), and Wang Weihui in the triple jump and javelin all have a good chance of winning. The triple jump also has a chance of a complete victory. Therefore, barring any accidents in the field events, the situation can at least be maintained.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Winners</h3>
<p>(1) 400 Meters, First Heat, First Place: Zeng Rongzhong (2) 400 Meters, Second Heat, First Place: He Debao (Photo by this publication)</p>
<p>The high hurdles are guaranteed to be won. There is no question. The third and fourth places will mostly be between Furukawa and Schwank. The United States only has Schwank, so there will be no issue in this category.</p>
<p>The 10,000 meters can be won by the Chinese team. The 10,000 meters team is full of talent. Long Zexian, Ma Fengrui, Chen Xuzhou, and Chen Xingpei are likely to secure positions. Only Remidius is a strong rival. No Japanese runners were seen in the long-distance races in Shanghai. The British runner Leppley and the American Hetson are third-rate runners.</p>
<p>The sprints are crucial. The most important thing is the short-distance finals.</p>
<p>Thomson and Thurlow will dominate three events, so there is no question. If Lin Guangxing, Zhou Ende, and Zhong Lianji can secure second or third place, then the championship will largely belong to us. As for the relay, it will be either first or second place. The difference is still small.</p>
<h3>First Day Scores of Each Country</h3>
<p>First Place: United States, 39 Points</p>
<p>Including 10 points for the 1500 meters, 10 points for the discus throw, 4 points for the high jump, 5 points for the long jump, and 10 points for the 400-meter relay, totaling 39 points. Second Place: China, 28 Points</p>
<p>Including 1 point for the 1500 meters, 1 point for the discus throw, 8 points for the high jump, 10 points for the long jump, and 8 points for the 400-meter relay, totaling 28 points. Third Place: England, 6 Points</p>
<p>Including 6 points for the 400-meter relay.</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Germany, 4 Points</p>
<p>Including 4 points for the discus throw.</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Portugal, 4 Points</p>

<h3>Shanghai Banking Club Billiards Finals Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>Li Gongying vs. Shen Lince</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Club has perfect facilities and thriving affairs. This year, considering that many members rarely have the opportunity to exercise due to their job duties, they rented a tennis court and established a tennis club. It is said that quite a few members have joined. Last month, they held a billiards handicap competition as usual, with 28 people participating. The finals are scheduled for tomorrow (June 8th) at 6:00 PM in the club's billiards room. The finalists are Li Gongying and Shen Lince. Mr. Li won the Shanghai Senior Billiards Association championship last year, creating a new record for Chinese people winning that championship. His billiards skills are naturally outstanding. Mr. Shen is also an expert. Although this handicap competition allowed him to score 700 points, he was able to fight his way to victory and participate in the finals. Therefore, it is unknown who will win on that night. The first-place winner will receive a large silver cup donated by Mr. Du Xigui, and the second-place winner will receive a silver cup from the club.</p>

<h3>Today's Schedule</h3>
<p>(1) 100 Meter Final 2:30 PM (2) 50 Meter Final 2:40 PM (3) Shot Put Final 2:45 PM (4) 400 Meter Final 2:55 PM (5) High Hurdles Final 3:05 PM (6) 100 Meter Final (Women) 3:15 PM (7) Pole Vault Final 3:20 PM (8) 10,000 Meter Final 3:30 PM (9) Javelin Final 3:35 PM (10) 1600 Meter Relay Final 4:10 PM (11) 200 Meter Final 4:20 PM (12) Triple Jump Final 4:25 PM (13) Intermediate Hurdles Final 4:30 PM (14) 800 Meter Final 4:40 PM (15) 800 Meter Relay Final 4:50 PM Award Ceremony and Closing 5:00 PM</p>
<h3>Today's Lineups</h3>
<p>(1) 100 Meters</p>
<p>(Total of 8 people, 4 from China, 1 Open, 1 English, 2 American) 2:30 PM</p>
<p>161 Thomson Thurlow (USA), yesterday's result... 11.6 seconds 2 Zhong Lianji (China), yesterday's result... 11.895 Yang (England), yesterday's result... 11.201 Tomaszewski (Public), yesterday's result... 11.83 Chen Guojun (China) 101 Wheal (England) 4 Jiang Peng 24 Lin Guangxing</p>
<p>Judging from the results yesterday, the American Thurlow is in the lead at 19. The Chinese Zhong Lianji and the Open Tomaszewski are tied in second place. Lin Guangxing will wait for an opportunity to move. There will definitely be a surprise today. However, it is difficult to say whether he can defeat Thurlow and surpass Zhong and Tomaszewski.</p>
<p>(2) Women's 50 Meters</p>
<p>(Total of 8 people, 3 English, 1 Portuguese, 1 American, 3 Chinese) 2:40 PM</p>
<p>250 Thomson (England), yesterday's result... 7.2 seconds 232 E. Vikto (Portugal), yesterday's result... 7.2 242 Schmidt (USA) 241 Bernett (USA) MacIntyre (USA) 219 Sheng Bi (China) 216 Zhang Pingxian (China) 217 Qian Hangsu (China)</p>
<p>It is really difficult for the Chinese women to compete with the English and Portuguese. There is very little hope of getting a position. This is due to the differences in natural physique and usual training, which cannot be expected overnight. Raise your spirits, work hard! It is said that the champion will be either Thomson or Vikto. However, Bernett and Schmidt should not be ignored either.</p>
<p>(3) Shot Put</p>
<p>(Total of 17 people, 5 French, 5 German, 1 Latvian, 1 American, 5 Chinese) 2:45 PM</p>
<p>20 Chen Jiaqiu (China) 21 Yuan Ming (China) 22 Wen Dingxin (China) 23 Cao Yu (China) 1 Wang Jihuai (China) 71 Fantan (France) 63 Laglia (France) 74 Bosuto (France) 76 Abbottini 111 Kramer (Germany) 131 Hillway (Latvia) 184 Turalo (USA) 181 Lange (USA) 185 Smith (USA) 192 Edson (USA) 194 Stoneton (USA)</p>
<p>In this competition, the strong general Chen Jiaqiu should be able to stand out. Some say that the French Bosuto has excellent results. If so, China and France will have a showdown to determine the best. Kramer, the only German representative, is a master of shot put and will definitely get a position. In addition, Cao Yu and Wang Jihuai all have hope. The American Lange is also known for his expertise.</p>
<p>(4) 400 Meters</p>
<p>(Total of 8 people, 4 Americans, 3 English, 1 Chinese)</p>
<p>2:55 PM</p>
<p>7 Zeng Rongzhong (China), yesterday's result... 54 and 5/4 seconds 8 He Debao (China), yesterday's result... 54 seconds 9 Su Zuqing (China) 161 Thurlow (USA) 18 Brierly (USA) 15 Jianwu (China) 162 Gutti (USA) 102 Nettard (England)</p>
<p>The American Thurlow saved his strength yesterday, but hopes to get a position in preparation for competing for the championship today, so he was only third. He Debao's result is good, and he can at least give Thurlow a fierce competition. Zeng Rongzhong, Su Zuqing, and the veteran Wang Jianwu may join forces. The American Brierly is very formidable and is sure to have a position.</p>
<p>(5) High Hurdles (Total of 6 people, 4 Chinese, 1 Japanese, 1 American)</p>
<p>3:05 PM</p>
<p>3 Chen Guojun (China), yesterday's result... 17.8 seconds 31 Tan (China), yesterday's result... 18 seconds 23 Cao Yu (China) 122 Furukawa (Japan) 176 Schwank (USA) 32 Li Wenchu (China)</p>
<p>Cao Yu is good at this event. If nothing else happens, he will definitely be the first choice in today's final. Chen Guojun is outstanding in this event, and the second spot is his hope. Schwank intends to compete with Tan for third place. It is said that Tan is more certain, which is quite true. We hope that Li Wenchu will work hard to create an all-Chinese top four.</p>
<p>(6) Women's 100 Meters (Total of 7 people, 1 English, 3 American, 1 Portuguese, 1 Chinese)</p>
<p>3:15 PM</p>
<p>250 Thomson (England), yesterday's result... 13.3 seconds 231 E. Vikto (Portugal), yesterday's result... 14 seconds 241 Bernett (USA) 222 Cheng Yongmei (China) 243 MacIntyre (USA) 24 Schmidt (USA) 219 Sheng Bi (China) In this event, Chinese women may have a chance to intervene, but at most, they can only be fourth or fifth. It is difficult to achieve anything higher. Thomson and E. Vikto have equal opportunities for the top spot.</p>
<p>(7) Pole Vault (Total of 13 people, 4 Chinese, 2 French, 2 Japanese, 1 Russian, 4 Americans)</p>
<p>3:20 PM</p>
<p>23 Cao Yu (China) 29 Li Lin (China) 37 Jiang Shanqing (China) 36 Chu Yinghuang (China) 78 Beisanke (France) 79 Rosan (France) 123 Okura (Japan) 128 Chiba 164 Bernett (USA) 176 Schwank (USA) 191 Huo Wei (USA) 188 Pecker (USA)</p>
<p>Cao Yu and Li Lin are the masters of pole vaulting in Shanghai. The Americans Bernett and Schwank also have the same skills. Even if there are differences, they are very subtle. Therefore, the competition between China and the United States will be fierce. If Jiang Shanqing and Chu Yinghuang can improve their average performance, they will definitely gain an advantage.</p>
<p>(8) 10,000 Meters (Total of 13 people)</p>
<p>3:30 PM</p>
<p>17 Ma Fengrui (China) 18 Chen Xuzhou (China) 19 Long Zexian (China) 12 Chen Xingpei (China) 69 Coreto (France) 62 Magento (France) 70 Newins (France) 71 Fantan (France) 72 Puti (France) 103 Leppley (England) 121 Hashikawa (Japan) 141 Remidy (Portugal) 175 Hetson</p>
<p>This competition will be one of the most interesting. The four Chinese generals, Long, Ma, and the two Chens, will inevitably show their skills for the public and for themselves. Ma once intended to break the national record. It is not known whether he will be able to do so today. The formidable rivals are Remidy of Portugal, who has a marathon title, and the American Hetson. The Japanese Hashikawa is unremarkable. The other five French athletes have unknown strength. What we heard is that they are mediocre.</p>
<p>(9) Javelin (Total of 15 people, 5 French, 3 Japanese, 1 Latvian, 1 American, 5 Chinese)</p>
<p>3:35 PM</p>
<p>1 Wang Jihuai (China) 22 Wen Dingxin (China) 20 Chen Baoqiu (China) 26 Liu Jiajun (China) 25 Xie Quanhe (China) 8 Lisen (France) 83 Newin Ruo (France) 84 Brockato (France) 122 Furukawa (Japan) 131 Hillway (Latvia) 183 Loafers (USA) 175 Hetson (USA) 1810 Lange (USA) 161 Thurlow (USA) 162 Gutti (USA)</p>
<p>Five countries are competing. The Chinese team has the best situation. Wang Jihuai can overwhelm the crowd and stand alone. Furukawa of Japan and Hetson of America are famous and can compete with Wen Dingxin and Chen Baoqiu for the lead.</p>
<p>(10) 1600 Meter Relay</p>
<p>4:10 PM</p>
<p>The main competition for the championship will be between China and the United States. Comparing the talents, the Chinese team has a better average. There is more hope of victory.</p>
<p>Final Winners</p>
<p>(1) High Jump, First Place: Li Zhongsan (China) (2) 1500 Meters, First Place: Sugden (USA) (3) Discus Throw, First Place: Kubin (USA) (4) Long Jump, First Place: Schwank (USA) (Photo by this publication)</p>
<p>(11) 200 Meters (Total of 6 people, 2 American, 3 English)</p>
<p>4:20 PM</p>
<p>161 Thurlow (USA), yesterday's result... 23.4 seconds 6 Zhou Ende (China), yesterday's result... 24 seconds 24 Lin Guangxing (China), yesterday's result... 24 seconds 101 Wheal (England) 163 Mario (USA) 165 Blaw (USA) The failure of our country's sprint athletes Zhong Lianji and Hao Chunde, and Gu Zaiping's muscle strain, have had a great impact on China. Otherwise, although the first place would belong to Thurlow, China could have taken over the next few seats. Now, only Lin Guangxing and Zhou Xingde can compete for second and third place.</p>
<p>(12) Triple Jump (Total of 11 people, 5 Japanese, 1 American)</p>
<p>4:25 PM</p>
<p>1 Wang Jihuai (China) 5 Hao Chunde (China) 30 Liang Tiancheng (China) 44 Jiaju (China) 29 Li Lin (China) 127 Komatsu (Japan) 176 Schwank (USA) 164 Bernett (USA) 190 Pierel (USA) 187 Glover (USA) 163 Mario (USA)</p>
<p>In this event, the United States and China each have five athletes, and Japan has a median presence. It seems that there is a confrontation between the United States and China, with Japan remaining neutral. In fact, the top three places, Wang Jihuai, Li Lin, and Hao Chunde, can be confidently taken over. The American Bernett and Schwank are relatively strong. Komatsu of Japan is said to be competitive as well. The focus of the competition is thought to be on the fourth and fifth positions.</p>
<h3>Women's Winners</h3>
<p>(1) Women's 50 Meters and 100 Meters Preliminary Second Place, Long Jump and High Jump Final First Place: Bernett (USA) (2) Women's 100 Meters and 50 Meters Second Heat Preliminary First Place: E. Vikto (Portugal) (3) Women's 100 Meters and 50 Meters First Heat Preliminary First Place: Thomson (England) (Photo by this publication)</p>
<p>(13) Intermediate Hurdles (Total of 5 people, 4 American)</p>
<p>4:30 PM</p>
<p>33 Tao Yingjie (China), yesterday's result... 61 and 5/4 seconds 20 Chen Baoqiu (China), yesterday's result... 61.8 seconds 34 Chen Buzhang (China) 167 Hofer (USA) 45 Wu Zuxian (China)</p>
<p>Five people are competing, and China has four athletes. It can be known that the situation is good. We hope that they will work hard to rank among the top and get more points for the future of the championship, which is not without relationship. The leading position will become the focus of the competition between Tao and Chen. It is feared that the others will not be able to reach the heights.</p>
<p>(14) 800 Meters (Total of 16 people)</p>
<p>4:40 PM</p>
<p>38 Li Shaoshang (China) 13 Qiu Lingru (China) 14 Fu He Fan (China) 15 Zhang Hu Gen (China) 16 Liang Yan Ping (China) 62 Magento (France) 63 Laglia (USA) 64 Marius (France) 55 Poplin (France) 65 Lemon (France) 131 Hillway (Latvia) 169 Sugden (USA) 170 Halitai (USA) 171 Wei Luo (USA) 174 Er (USA) 202 Zhu Yucheng (Public)</p>
<p>The American Sugden has the potential to dominate various countries. Although China can occupy one or two positions, the average may not be as good as the Americans.</p>
<p>(15) 800 Relay</p>
<p>Starting at 4:50 PM</p>
<p>Whether the championship will belong to China or the United States is worth studying. Both sides have rich talent this time. However, whether the relay skills are pure and practiced is closely related to victory or defeat. The distinction between high and low in the future may be divided because of this.</p>
<h3>Photos of the Final, Fierce Battle in the 1500 Meters</h3>
<p>A crowd of seventeen people stepped forward. The Chinese Zhang Hugen took the lead, refreshing and fast, leading the way. Dong Jiaxie followed. Remidy and Sugden chased behind, and Chen Xingpei followed closely behind Remidy. In the second lap, at the halfway point of 700 meters, Remidy and Sugden were still comfortably following behind. After 1000 meters, Lei Su's footsteps accelerated as they flew, catching up to Zhang and Dong. But one was rising, and the other was exhausted. So it was known that Zhang and Dong were in danger. Gradually falling behind and farther away, in the last 200 meters, Lei Su both charged fiercely. Sugden rushed out about three meters ahead of Remidius at 80 meters from the finish line and won first place. Truelock came in third, and Harletai caught up, with Qiu Lingru taking fourth place. The result of 4 minutes and 11.94 seconds was very satisfying.</p>
<h3>Unexpected Failure of Chinese in the Discus Throw</h3>
<p>The discus throw results were mediocre. There were few outstanding athletes among the sixteen people. 32.83 meters Wang Jihuai and Chen Baoqiu could both achieve this number. The farthest the two threw was only around 30 meters. The referee Shen Kunnan said that they were nervous on the field and the discus went out too high, so the landing point was close. Initially, the German Kramer had just over 32 meters. Seeing the German flag planted, the others sighed. Although Tomaszewski participated in the open qualifying competition and was counted, Wang Chen was still disappointed in the last throw, which can be said to be an unexpected loss. Kubin's last throw won him first place. It was really lucky.</p>
<h3>The Frustrating Long Jump Final</h3>
<p>Before the last five minutes of the long jump, it was still completely dominated by the Chinese. The Chinese occupied the top one, two, three, four, and five spots. Wang Jihuai was leading with 6.40 meters. Who knew that in the sixth jump, Schwank jumped 6.46 meters, overtaking Wang Jihuai. This 0.06 meters caused the Chinese to lose all their efforts. The results were still acceptable.</p>
<h3>Li Zhongsan's Worries in the High Jump</h3>
<p>Fifteen people competed in the high jump, gradually eliminating each other. Li Lin steadily sat in fifth place with 1.68 meters. Gu Huo then jumped over 1.72 meters, sitting in fourth place. Li Zhongsan, Anderson, and the Japanese Furukawa competed for the top three. Up to 1.76 meters, Li Zhongsan passed, and Furukawa also passed. Anderson also passed on the third try. Adding one,</p>
<p>If he could pass 1.82 meters, it would be a new national record. Li jumped and failed, and everyone was worried. Furukawa and Anderson also failed, which was very comforting. Then he lowered one level to five feet eleven. Li failed to pass, and Furukawa and the two also failed to pass. Then he retreated to five feet ten. Li passed, and Gu An failed. Li then won the championship. At five feet eight, Gu (one jump) Furukawa failed, and Anderson took second place.</p>
<h3>Great Pity in the 400 Meter Relay</h3>
<p>The Chinese team had good talent in the 400-meter relay. In the first leg, Zhong Lianji surpassed the American Mario by a lot. In the second leg, Zhou Ende was even farther ahead. Bernett could not catch up. However, Zhou's handoff to the third leg, Hao Chunde, was not coordinated. Schwank jumped ahead, and Lin Xing had no way to catch Thurlow. It was a great pity.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Preliminary Rounds of Short Distances</h3>
<p>Thurlow easily ran the first place in the 100 meters and 200 meters, looking at the second-place runner while the results were the best. The final is very likely to win. In the 400 meters, Thurlow did not exert effort, only vying for a position to prepare for today's competition. Lin Guangxing did not have any special features, perhaps because of the preliminary round. Zhou Ende may have hope in the 200 meters. Gu Zaiping finished third in the third heat of the 100 meters and had cramps at the finish line, giving up the 200 meters. Chinese people really need to work hard in the short distances, otherwise it is dangerous and perilous. In the high hurdles, Schwank and Furukawa cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Women's Performance</h3>
<p>British and American Women Show Great Power</p>
<p>Chinese Records are All Broken</p>
<p>Sun Guiyun and Ka Juyun Are No Match</p>
<p>The women's performance included a total of five events: 50 meters, 100 meters, 4-meter relay, long jump, and high jump. The results of the preliminary rounds and finals showed that the British and American women won all the championships, all exceeding the Chinese records. Let's compare it:</p>
<p>Chinese Record, Conference Record</p>
<p>50 Meters Wu Meixian seconds 3 Thomson 7.2 seconds 100 Meters Sun Guiyun 13.8 seconds Thomson 13.3 seconds Long Jump Bian Juyun 4.6 Bernett 4.59 High Jump Zhu Tianzhen 1.29 Bernett 1.38 400 Meter Relay North Team 58 seconds USA Team 57.8 seconds In the 50-meter preliminary, Thomson and Vikto both took the first place with 7.2 seconds. Thomson's starting foot was still slow, otherwise the results would be unimaginable. Zhang Pingxian and Sheng Bi only got the right position.</p>
<p>In the 100-meter preliminary, the two group champions were still Vikto and Thomson. Thomson's result was 13.3 seconds, about five or six meters ahead of others. Zhang Pingxian gave up the 100 meters.</p>
<p>In the long jump, Bernett's lowest score was 4.45 meters, and Thomson also had 4.45 meters. Their footsteps were not measured accurately. It can be seen that they usually practice hard if they jump and get this distance.</p>
<p>In the high jump, Bernett and Thomson competed for first place. Bernett passed 1.38 meters, but Thomson did not pass, so she was second. Bai jumped with extreme ease, something that Chinese women can't even dream of.</p>
<p>In the 400-meter relay, Ma Yufang and Qian Hangsu exceeded the Americans and Portuguese in the first and second legs. In the third leg, Zhang Yiming tripped on the track, stood up, and ran again. Zhang Pingxian was in third place.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Grand Opening of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's National Goods Market</h3>
<p>More Than 700 Attendees</p>
<p>A Remarkable Occasion</p>
<p>The National Goods Market, organized by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Products Exhibition Hall, held its grand opening ceremony at 9:00 AM yesterday in the Chamber of Commerce's auditorium. Over 700 representatives from various city organizations and groups attended, making it a truly remarkable occasion. In addition to presenting various national goods on the spot, the "National Products Guide" newspaper also distributed special editions. The details of the event are summarized below:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Proceedings</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began at approximately 10:00 AM. After the customary greetings, Chairman Ye Huijun of the Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech outlining the purpose of the event. This was followed by speeches from Vice Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Industry, a representative of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Wang Jiean representing the Jiangsu Chamber of Commerce, and Dong Keren representing the Bureau of Social Affairs. Wang Xiaolai gave a response. After the ceremony concluded, the representatives proceeded to tour the market.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Chairman Ye Huijun stated in his address:</p>
<p>"Today, as our Chamber of Commerce's Products Exhibition Hall holds the grand opening ceremony for the National Goods Market, we are deeply honored by the presence and guidance of distinguished guests from all sectors. Our Exhibition Hall was established in the tenth year of the Republic of China [1921] and has been operating for ten years, showcasing the finest national products for public reference. Over these ten years, in addition to hosting six exhibitions and setting up temporary national goods markets, we have been open daily for public viewing. However, considering the recent influx of imported goods and the perceived inferiority of national products, despite the prosperity of Shanghai and the abundance of shops, it is surprisingly difficult to find a place that exclusively sells national goods. This leaves those who wish to support national products without a place to go. Our Chamber of Commerce is responding to the needs of the times, recognizing that the Exhibition Hall should not only serve as a place for viewing but also for purchasing. Therefore, the establishment of the National Goods Market is an urgent necessity for promoting national products. The previous National Industrial and Commercial Conference passed a resolution to encourage the establishment of national goods markets, and national goods exhibition halls in Nanjing and Hangzhou have already established national goods markets. Our Chamber of Commerce is ideally located in a bustling area with numerous shops and a dense population. Therefore, by establishing a National Goods Market with sound organization and diligent management, we can undoubtedly achieve significant business development. This will not only foster a love for national goods among residents but also effectively promote the sales of national products, achieving multiple benefits in one stroke. We believe this is an essential undertaking. The Standing Committee of our Chamber of Commerce resolved to convert one floor of the Exhibition Hall into a permanent National Goods Market before the Tenth Anniversary Exhibition, which will be held during the Double Tenth Festival [October 10th] this year. After three months of preparation, we have finally achieved success. The current market differs from ordinary exhibitions and temporary national goods markets. To ensure the overall quality of the market, we limited each industry to only one participating manufacturer, preventing the inclusion of similar products. We also carefully selected national goods, focusing on aesthetic presentation and arrangement. Participating manufacturers enthusiastically embraced a spirit of sacrifice, not solely for profit. We are grateful to the China General Edison Company for installing electric lights, the Zhenhua Paint Company for painting the cabinets, and the Eastern Lamp Company for decorating with New Year's lanterns. Although we charged a nominal fee to cover costs, the prices were extremely reasonable. We also appreciate the Hongzhang Textile and Dyeing Factory's donation of flag cloth and the generous gifts from various factories for distribution to guests and customers, adding to the enjoyment. These included MSG from Tianchu Flavoring Essence Factory, cigarettes from the Huacheng Tobacco Company, wine from Dykun, and Zhongshan olives from Guanshengyuan. We are deeply grateful for their enthusiastic support. On behalf of the Chamber of Commerce and the National Goods Market, I extend my thanks to everyone. I hope that all participating manufacturers will work together harmoniously, embracing a spirit of collaboration to promote the development of national products. I also hope that all the esteemed guests present today will continue to support us with their patriotic spirit, providing guidance and promoting our efforts. Furthermore, I earnestly hope that the media will actively advocate and publicize our efforts so that our national goods will continue to improve and one day rival those of other countries. I have high expectations."</p>
<p>Speech by Zhao</p>
<p>Vice Minister Zhao Jinqing of the Ministry of Industry stated in his speech: "Today, as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's National Goods Market opens, Minister Kong is unable to attend due to official duties and has specifically asked me to represent him. I have one thought to share: the call for promoting national goods did not begin today. In Shanghai alone, there have long been organizations such as the National Goods Maintenance Association, the National Goods Promotion Association, and the National Goods Factories Association, all dedicated to promoting national goods. Temporary markets have also been established in more than one location. Why, then, is it still necessary to promote national goods today? While we cannot blame the people, the underdevelopment of our national goods is a major factor. I will not dwell on other examples, but considering only rice and flour, customs statistics show that we lose approximately 250 million [currency not specified] annually. You can imagine the scale of the problem. I have also repeatedly told my friends in the National Goods Factories Association that we must promote national goods impartially, supporting not only our own products but also those of others. I have seen cases where the products of a national goods factory are excellent, yet the owner's wife and daughters do not use them. This is like going to a Chinese restaurant and ordering oxtail soup. I believe that promoting national goods is not only patriotic and beneficial to others but also ultimately in our own interest. At a time when industry is depressed and production is low, young people often have no way out and resort to suicide. Who doesn't have children? We must plan for their future. The best way to provide them with livelihoods is to vigorously promote production. Promoting production requires a focus on manufacturing national goods. If national goods do not thrive, money will flow out of the country. Money is to a nation as blood is to a body. If the blood dries up, the body will wither. Therefore, we must act before the blood dries up and prevent our nation from perishing." (Other speeches were omitted.)</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Gifts</p>
<p>On this day, the market pre-issued invitation letters, and each holder of a letter received a bag of national goods. The products and quantities donated by various manufacturers are listed below: Huacheng Tobacco Company: 10,000 cigarettes; China Toothpick Factory: four bundles of toothpicks; Tianchu Flavoring Essence Factory: 1,200 bottles of MSG; French Drugstore: 1,000 packets of Rendan [a traditional Chinese medicine]; Tianran Xianweijing Factory: 20 dozen bottles of Xianweijing sauce; Guanshengyuan: 300 cans of Zhongshan olives and 200 bags of fruit; The Commercial Press: 2,000 portraits of Sun Yat-sen, 1,200 daily and large calendars; Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company: 500 packs of 10 Platinum Dragon cigarettes, 500 packs of 10 Great Wall cigarettes; Paris Cosmetics Factory: 1,000 packs of toothpaste; Family Industrial Cooperative: 1,000 packs of toothpaste; Dykun Company: 500 bottles of wine.</p>
<p>Chen Zuogan, manager of the Lianhua Woolen Mill in Hele Lane, North Henan Road, this city, has always been enthusiastic about the national goods movement. Yesterday, he also transported dozens of the mill's most popular products, including "Three Rings" brand wool swimsuits, hemp swimsuits, sports vests, woolen rope shirts, trousers, men's and women's scarves, woolen socks, and silk stockings, for display to promote the cause.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Anti-Epidemic Campaign</h3>
<p>A Grand Parade by Boy Scouts</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day for the Shanghai Municipal Anti-Cholera Campaign's Boy Scout parade, which traveled straight through the Chinese and foreign concessions. The sky was overcast all day, and there was a brief drizzle at 4:35 PM. All the Chinese and foreign Boy Scout troops participating in the city entered the Dalin Road Public Sports Field at 1:25 PM and remained assembled for some time. At that time, Chief Commander Wang Gang and Shen Hao and Wu Liguo from the Health Bureau blew whistles to signal the start of the parade. The scale of the event was unprecedented for an anti-cholera campaign. The events of yesterday are described below:</p>
<p>Officials Present</p>
<p>Officials present at the venue at 0:05 PM yesterday included: Bi Dehui, member of the National Health Administration of the Ministry of the Interior; Hu Hongji, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau; Section Chiefs Shen Hao and Wu Liguo; and over ten staff members. Also present were Wang Gang, Chief Commander of the Boy Scout Troops; Wei Zhiren, Director-General of the French Concession Municipal Council; Pu Bo, Director of the Health Department; Xu Fujun, Chief of the Anti-Epidemic Department; Fei Deng, Director of the Health Department of the Public Concession; Yan Fuqing of the Central University Medical College; and over forty others, who were on-site directing the event.</p>
<p>Number of Troops</p>
<p>Starting at 0:30, Boy Scout troops from various schools successively entered the field and formed ranks. The schools included the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Night School, the Commercial and Industrial Youth Propaganda Corps, Hou Dan, Shizhong, China Women's Physical Education, Patriotic Jinan, Yucai, Southeast, Pudong Middle School, Shangzhong, East Asia, Lizhi, Moore Memorial Church, Chengzhong, Liangjiang, China Physical Education College, Guangzhao Public School, Guangyi, and other Chinese and foreign Boy Scout troops, totaling over 1,200 people. Also present were forty members of the Fifth Detachment of the Public Security Bureau Police and fifteen police officers from the Second District Police Department.</p>
<p>Inside the sports field, Boy Scout troops from various schools were led by commanders into designated areas. After a while, the perimeter of the field was packed with spectators. Fortunately, there was no scorching sun, so the officials on-site were able to proceed smoothly with their tasks. Various models, such as a paper coffin with no bottom, inscribed with red and white anti-cholera warnings conveying common sense, buckets of sewage, paper boats, fruit baskets, and night soil buckets, all had large signs. Unclean food and utensils were covered with flies. There were also six oversized artificial flies. The Public and French Concessions had made fifty loudspeakers, dozens of large banners with slogans, and several health warning signs. In particular, the sickbed team and the thirty-odd simulated male and female cholera patients, placed on canvas stretchers, were a shocking reminder of battlefield casualties. Other items were too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Departure</p>
<p>When the parade set off from the Public Sports Field, sixteen traffic police officers on bicycles led the way, followed by the Chief Commander's car. The Shanghai Middle School band led the first team, and the music filled the air, creating a tense atmosphere. Fifty-two Boy Scout troops moved in an orderly and uniform manner. As the teams reached the middle section of Dalin Road, the sidewalks were packed with spectators, making it almost impossible to pass. Fortunately, the traffic police were able to maintain order about five or six yards ahead, minimizing congestion.</p>
<p>Parade Overview</p>
<p>The procession snaked its way to Avenue Foch near the Great World amusement center, where the crowds were extremely dense. The Great World's western-facing floors were filled with spectators watching the parade on the street. Public buses and trolley buses were temporarily suspended. At 3:10 PM, the procession reached the intersection of Tibet Road and Nanking Road. At 4:05 PM, the procession reached Avenue Albert, and at 5:15 PM, it reached the middle section of Baoshan Road. At this time, there was a light drizzle.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The teams maintained their spirit and showed little sign of fatigue. The rain soon stopped, and at 6:20 PM, the procession arrived at the end of North Sichuan Road. Along the way, the teams shouted anti-cholera slogans in unison. The most amusing team was the sewage team. At the front was a paper boat carried by four people. Two students from the East Asia Physical Education College, dressed as boatmen, wore white towels around their heads, were about 27 years old, and wore blue cloth shirts and trousers. They applied white powder to their faces and carried chamber pots and scrub brushes, one holding a bundle of greens. They grimaced and shouted, "This man took a great risk, drinking raw water and sewage. He got cholera!" They would then point to the sickbed behind the boat with a simulated dead person and shout, "Everyone, look! He died from drinking unclean water!" They repeated this at every location, to the applause of the audience. The coffin team and the health team were also well-organized. Chinese and foreign Boy Scouts distributed leaflets. Injection vehicles provided by the concession authorities and the Health Bureau passed through the area, encouraging spectators to get cholera vaccinations. When the parade reached the end of North Sichuan Road at the intersection of Tientung'an Road, the over one thousand Chinese and foreign Boy Scouts were transported back to their schools by waiting trucks.</p>

<p>Roadside Protection</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the parade traveled over ten li [approximately 3 miles] through the Chinese and foreign concessions. There were no incidents. Fifty-five members of the Public Security Bureau's detachment and police officers maintained order along the route. At the junction of Avenue des Cerisiers and the French Concession, the police team handed over the flag to French Concession police officers. At the junction of Avenue Foch and Tibet Road, the guards of the Public Concession were exchanged. From the start to the destination, the order was well maintained.</p>
<p>Parade Notes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the officials of the Health Bureau and Chief Commander Wang Gang all skipped lunch. They rushed to the sports field after 10:00 AM and were busy. The Youlian Film Company sent people to film at the venue and along the route. The photographers ran around, sweating profusely, trying to capture everything. The Lever Brothers Soap Factory, a foreign company, provided a large car to distribute advertising leaflets and shouted to buy Lever disinfectant soap.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui's Talk</h3>
<p>Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning Specifically to Dispel Rumors</p>
<p>Total Elimination of Communist Bandits Within One Month</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, Garrison Commander of Shanghai and Songhu, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:00 AM on the overnight express train from Nanjing after being summoned to the capital by Chairman Chiang for important consultations. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed him at his residence. Xiong's foot ailment has fully recovered, and he is in high spirits. His remarks are recorded below: Construction Plans Xiong stated that regarding the central government's recent measures and the political situation, there are four points worth reporting: (1) The central government is continuing to vigorously pursue construction projects according to the original plan and is intensifying its efforts, without delaying due to other factors. The Supreme Economic Council will be established soon to plan economic construction, and the diplomatic policy will also proceed according to a fixed procedure.</p>
<p>Guangdong Incident (2) The internal elements of the Guangdong issue are politically complex, even more so than the Enlarged Conference. From a scientific standpoint, it is impossible to combine incompatible elements in one place and expect them to harmonize. Recent divisions indicate impending defeat. In terms of military strength, they are nothing more than a few divisions and cannot resist the central government. In the eyes of informed observers, the Guangdong side's actions are childish. The central government has adopted a policy of non-interference, allowing them to survive or perish on their own. Total Elimination of Communist Bandits (3) The central government believes that the biggest hidden danger is the Communist bandits. Therefore, it has resolved to completely eliminate them, using the national force to concentrate on Jiangxi Province, giving a deadline of one month for complete elimination, with a maximum of two months. Chairman Chiang has decided to personally go to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression.</p>
<p>Situation in North China (4) Regarding the situation in North China, the northern generals all obey the central government's orders. Rumors are unbelievable. In the current situation, Yan and Feng no longer have the ability to command their subordinates. The recent telegrams from northern generals denouncing Gu Chenhao for creating chaos further prove that there is nothing to worry about. Vice Commander Zhang is suffering from the flu. Mayor Zhang has repeatedly telegraphed, saying that he will be discharged in about one to two weeks. Xiong then said that he heard rumors in Nanjing about malicious people spreading rumors in Shanghai. Therefore, he returned to Shanghai to inspect the situation. He will still need to go to Nanjing in the next few days to meet with Chairman Chiang to discuss the elimination of the Communist bandits.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Departed for Europe Yesterday</h3>
<p>First to Dalian, Then Via Russia</p>
<p>Over One Hundred People Saw Him Off at the Wharf</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, accompanied by his secretary Xiao Jinfang, boarded the Japanese ship "Tianjin Maru" at 2:00 PM yesterday to go to Dalian, then via the Chinese Eastern Railway to go abroad to The Hague to attend the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>A Grand Send-Off In addition to his wife and sons, those who went to the Huangpu Wharf to see him off included Zhu Lihe, Minister of Judicial Administration; Wei Daoming, Mayor of Nanjing; Xie Guansheng, Secretary-General of the Judicial Yuan; Lin Biao, President of the Jiangsu High Court; and Xu Weizhen, Yang Zhaozhen, Wu Kunwu, Yang Pusheng, Zheng Yuxiu, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others, totaling over one hundred people. Wang, wearing a black suit, smiled and personally shook hands with each of the Wang Chonghui (photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>those who came to see him off. Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Huang Jinrong also presented exquisite flower baskets.</p>
<p>Wang's Remarks According to Wang's remarks to reporters on the ship, "In addition to Secretary Xiao Jinfang escorting me to Manchuria, there are no other companions. The Russian transit visa has already been obtained in Harbin. As for the position of President of the Judicial Yuan, I find it difficult to manage both duties because I am serving as an international judge. Therefore, I have firmly resigned from the position to the National Government to make way for a capable person. The International Court of Justice has rescheduled the hearing on the German-Austrian customs union case for July 16. The hearing period will be approximately six weeks. The court will likely close in late August. I plan to return to China at the end of the year and meet with you all again."</p>

<h3>Peace Movement at Jing'an Temple</h3>
<p>Launching the "Ten Thousand Years of Universal Benefit Water and Land Dharma Service"</p>
<p>Since Abbot Zhi Fa took over at Jing'an Temple, he has been thinking about revitalizing the temple and restoring the reputation that was tarnished under the previous abbot. Recently, he and the major lay Buddhists of the Buddha Light Society launched the "Ten Thousand Years of Universal Benefit Water and Land Dharma Service" to chant sutras and deliver the souls of the soldiers who died in the years of war and the souls of those who died unjustly from floods, droughts, wars, and diseases in various provinces, hoping to use the power of Buddhism to reverse the disaster and pray for peace. Yesterday, a meeting of the initiators was convened.

<h3>The Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>Held a Reception for the Press to Report on the Disaster Situation</p>
<p>With a Goal of 500,000 [Currency not Specified]</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association held a tea reception for the press at the Red Cross Society General Office yesterday at 4:00 PM. Xiong Shihui, representing the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and Chen Guozhan and Wang Peiyuan, aides, described the Jiangxi disaster situation in detail, stating that the bandit disaster accounted for two-thirds of Jiangxi Province and the flood disaster accounted for one-third. According to surveys in areas that have already been cleared, approximately 900,000 houses have been burned down, over 169,000 people have been killed, and property losses amount to approximately 24,200,000 [currency not specified]. The areas where the bandit disaster has not subsided have not yet been surveyed. In total, about 70 of the province's 81 counties are devastated. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. It is requested that the media unanimously support and widely publicize the situation. Reporters then visited Xiong Shihui at his residence. According to Xiong, he reported the disastrous situation in Jiangxi to Chairman Chiang during his trip to Nanjing and requested that the central government find ways to provide relief. Chiang agreed to make proper arrangements for fundamental relief measures. Fundraising in Shanghai is for temporary emergency relief, with a goal of 500,000 [currency not specified]. The efforts are actively underway.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Denies Duty-Free Import of Cuban Sugar</h3>
<p>Encouraging Sugar Merchants to Think Fundamentally</p>
<p>The local Sugar Trade Association previously reported that a large quantity of Cuban sugar would be imported into China duty-free and sold at low prices, causing a significant impact. The association telegraphed the various departments of the National Government, requesting assistance. Yesterday, the association received a reply from the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Received your telegram. Upon investigation, China's annual imports of foreign sugar are valued at around 100 million [currency not specified], ranking second among all imported goods subject to tariffs. It is imperative to seek self-sufficiency in sugar to close the loopholes. Therefore, it is necessary to refine crude sugar to meet immediate needs and cultivate raw materials to strengthen the foundation. The Fourth Plenary Session of the last year had a resolution on this matter. The Ministry is now developing a comprehensive sugar industry plan to gradually implement this resolution. As for the submitted sections, after investigation, the domestic sugar production has been decreasing in recent years. Before the Republic, Shanghai sold over one million dan [approximately 110,231 lbs] annually. Last year, it had decreased to 50,000 dan. The government is deeply concerned about this situation and should take measures to support the development of the industry at any time. The association's claim that the import of Cuban sugar was approved by the government with duty-free imports is absolutely untrue and should not be a concern. The current difficulties faced by sugar merchants, claiming to be affected by the high value of gold and the low value of silver, are a separate issue. The Ministry has not heard of Cuban sugar being sold at particularly low prices. In general, the sugar merchants of the association have a patriotic heart. During this period, they should think fundamentally, improve technology extensively, reduce costs, and provide a large quantity of raw sugar to assist the government in developing the refined sugar industry, so that the domestic sugar industry can gradually make progress."</p>

<h3>Five Kidnappers in the Li Guoliang Case Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Xu Jiajun Died Without Regret</p>
<p>Li Shaoxuan Asked His Wife to Collect His Body</p>
<p>Chen Zhenzhi Sang Erhuang Opera On the Spot</p>
<p>Wei Huizhang Wrote Characters in Court</p>
<p>Zhang Kun Missed His Wife and Mother</p>
<p>Xu Jiajun, from Yunnan, was related to Li Guoliang, the owner of the Xingli Copper and Tin Shop at 515 Zhejiang Road. Knowing that Li was well-off, he conspired with Li Shaoxuan (also known as Yang Nanxuan) from Sichuan, Chen Zhenzhi (also known as Xia Jizhi) from Hubei, Zhang Kun, and Wei Huizhang from Danyang to kidnap Li on the evening of November 28 last year and demand a huge ransom. The case was solved by the Lao Zha Police Station and sent to the Special District Local Court for trial. Xu, Li, Chen, Zhang, and Wei were each sentenced to death. The Special Court submitted the case to the higher authorities, and the order was issued to execute the death penalty by firing squad. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng Shangfeng instructed the police station to send detectives to the West Prison to interrogate the five criminals and ask if they had any last words. Xu Jiajun said, "I am 33 years old this year, and I die without regret. I have already written and sent a letter to my family from prison. However, I still have 500 [currency not specified] deposited with Sun Zhongweng at the Heshengji Pawnshop in Gongshun Lane, Wuma Road. Please inform them to return the money to my family to support my children." Li Shaoxuan said, "I am 32 years old. Please write a letter to my wife, Huang Abao, at 36 Ximen Road, to collect my body and retrieve my deposit of six yuan [currency not specified] from the police station to buy ingots to burn for me." Chen said, "I am 26 years old. Today, I am finally freed from suffering and have no regrets." Wei said, "I am 30 years old. Please give me paper and pen so I can write characters on the spot to leave as a souvenir." The characters he wrote were incoherent and unintelligible. Zhang said, "I am 24 years old. Please send the lined spring leather robe that I have stored in prison to the Zhang Xingtai Dye Shop in Xujiawan to be given to my father." After the interrogation, they were given wine and food as usual, then escorted onto prisoner trucks and taken to the execution ground at the Second Jiangsu Prison in Caohejing. The Local Court appointed Prosecutor Wang Sixian as the execution officer. Police Chief Xu Jinqing and police officer Chen [name illegible] assembled the execution police officers Wang Jianqing, Gu Hanqing, Zhu Wanyuan, Xue Bingzhang, Li Zuoqing, Zou Zhen dong, and Zhang Chunshen, who brought the criminals forward. Xu Jiajun said, "I am 33 years old, from Yunnan. My mother is at home, and I have no last words." Li Shaoxuan said, "I am 32 years old, from Sichuan. My mother is in my hometown. I ask that two pieces of clothing be kept for my mother to claim when she comes to see her son's face." Chen Zhenzhi said, "I am 26 years old, from Hubei. I have no last words." He then sang Erhuang opera loudly in front of the court. Wei Huizhang said, "I am 30 years old, from Danyang. I regret that I want to write a letter but have nowhere to send it." Zhang Kun said, "I am 24 years old, from Hubei. I have a wife, children, and an elderly mother at home. Tell them to live well." At this point, the execution order was carried out. Under the command of Police Chief Xu, the execution police officers executed the criminals by firing squad. The bodies were taken away by the court for burial.</p>
<h3>Horse Songting Executed by Strangulation for Strangling His Paramour</h3>
<p>Sending a Letter to His Brother to Entrust His Orphaned Child</p>
<p>Breaking Out in a Loud Cursing of His Paramour</p>
<p>Ma Songting from Suqian previously lured Song Qiaobao, a young widow, from Suzhou to Shanghai and lived with her as his paramour. On the morning of February 13th of last year, Ma suddenly conceived a plan to kill her for her money. He strangled the woman to death at their residence at 373 Hejian Road, then robbed her of her gold jewelry and cash, and fled. This spring, he was apprehended by the police in Nanjing. Detectives were dispatched by the Shanghai police to escort him back to Shanghai, where he was tried and sentenced to death by the Special District Local Court. Yesterday afternoon, the execution by strangulation was carried out. Judge Cheng brought Ma to court for questioning. According to his confession, he had a son named Shengxing who should be entrusted to his brother Ma Shouting and his sister-in-law for upbringing. He had nothing else to say. Judge Cheng then offered him food and wine. After he finished eating, he was ordered to be escorted into a prison van and taken to the Caohejing Jiangsu Second Prison execution ground. Wang Enxian, a prosecutor from the Local Court, was appointed as the supervising officer of the execution. He immediately ordered Police Chief Xu Jinqing and Police Officer Chen Xihui to accompany the executioners Zhu Wanwan, Wang Jianqing, and Zou Zhendong to Caohejing Jiangsu Second Prison. The judge, along with Warden Dong, took their seats. The prisoner was brought in and questioned again. The prisoner requested to write a letter to his brother Ma Shouting at Xiangyan Bridge, informing him that he had been executed. He then broke out in a loud cursing of Song Qiaobao. The judge ordered the execution to proceed. Police Chief Xu and Police Officer Chen, in collaboration with the executioners, bound the prisoner to the stake in accordance with the law and slowly strangled him with a rope. He soon stopped breathing. After the coroner confirmed his death, the judge ordered the strangulation stake to be sealed and preserved for a re-examination on a later date, before the body was taken for burial.</p>
<h3>Silk Merchant Zhu Ligeng Identifies Kidnapping Bandits</h3>
<p>Zhang Debiao Once Brandished a Gun, Threatening</p>
<p>Hao Zifeng Seized the Bodyguard's Gun</p>
<p>The Two Bandits Were Speechless After Being Identified</p>
<p>Wang Zhenhuan, the owner of the Wang Yutai Tea Shop, was previously kidnapped by bandits on Julai Road in the French Concession. During the pursuit of the kidnappers, Chinese Constable No. 2124 of the New Gate Police Station in the Public Concession was shot and killed by the bandits while resisting arrest. Recently, the French police apprehended the male and female bandits Zhang Debiao and Hao Zifeng, along with their paramours Hao Su and Zhang Shen, and handed them over to the French Concession Court. Zhang and Hao were each sentenced to five years in the Western Prison, and the two women were each sentenced to one year. It is now learned that the police authorities of the Public Concession suspected that the bandits were responsible for the shooting death of Chinese Constable No. 2124. Therefore, Chinese Detective Chief Lu Liankui and Detective Officers Tang Jian and Wang Chengying specially brought the four bandits back to the General Police Station for investigation. The four bandits vehemently denied shooting the Chinese Constable. However, Zhang Debiao confessed that on the morning of April 4th at 8:00 AM, he had conspired with three accomplices to kidnap Zhu Ligeng, a merchant from Haimen, on Changsha Road, but failed. Zhu is currently 42 years old, resides at No. 215 Changsha Road, and owns the Zhongfu Silk Factory in Zhabei. He usually travels in a No. 10320 car and employs a bodyguard, Wang Xueren. That morning, Zhu and Wang were about to board the car in front of their residence when four bandits suddenly rushed out from the side of the road. One prevented the driver, Chen Xiangyun, from driving, one boarded Zhu's car intending to seize the bodyguard's weapon, and another held a handgun to prevent Zhu from shouting. Fortunately, Wang Xue was alert and took the opportunity to get out of the car and run quickly into a nearby alley. One bandit immediately chased after Wang, who then fired a gun at the bandit. The bandits, realizing that they were prepared and that it would be difficult to succeed, fled in a panic. Zhu was thus spared from becoming a "wealth god." Later, based on intelligence reports, the police learned that Zhang's confession implicated the other men and women. Zhu, his bodyguard, and the driver were summoned to the police station. Zhang and Hao were mixed among a group of other criminals, and Zhu was asked to identify them. Zhu identified Zhang Debiao as the bandit who had pointed a gun at him and prevented him from shouting, and Wang Xueren also identified Hao as the bandit who had tried to seize his gun. Thereupon, the two bandits lowered their heads in silence. Subsequently, the bandits' women, Zhang Shen and Hao Su, further confessed that four or five days before the attempted kidnapping of Zhu, they had delivered a handgun to the Xieji Hotel on Hankou Road to Zhang. Yesterday morning, the police sent the four men and women to the Special District Local Court to report the details of the case. Zhu and his driver also appeared in court to testify. Judge Ge questioned the four bandits and ordered them to be detained separately for a subsequent hearing.</p>
<h3>Son-in-Law Xue Files Suit to Claim His Children's Share of Maternal Grandfather's Estate</h3>
<p>Temporarily Calculated at 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Trial Postponed Due to Unpaid Court Fees</p>
<p>After the death of Xue Baorun, a prominent dye merchant, his wives and children engaged in lawsuits to contest his estate, which have continued unabated. The family members have become enemies. For the past six months, reports about the Xue family's estate battle have repeatedly appeared in newspapers. Now, Hua Lihou, Hua Yigu, and Hua Manyun, father and children, have jointly filed a lawsuit, requesting the court to order Xue Sun, Xue Yisheng, Xue Yansheng, Xue Jiasheng, and Xue Gensheng to hand over the entire estate for distribution. Xue Baorun had a total of seven children. The defendants in this case, with the exception of Xue Sun, are all sons of Baorun. There are also three daughters named Xue Qin舫, Xue Chaoqun, and Xue Baobao. Qin舫 married Hua Lihou in the 34th year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty) and had two sons, Hua Yihong and Hua Yigu, and a daughter, Manyun. Qin舫 passed away in 1919. Now, because Yigu and Manyun are minors, this legal action to claim a share of their maternal grandfather's estate is being pursued by their father, Hua Lihou, as their legal guardian. Although this case appears to be a dispute between nephews/nieces and their maternal grandmother and uncles, it is in reality a conflict between a son-in-law and his mother-in-law and brothers-in-law. Since the enactment of laws granting women the right to inherit their parents' estate, the number of estate division lawsuits has greatly increased. However, it is rare to see a case where, after a daughter's death, her son-in-law and nephews/nieces are fighting for a share of the in-laws' estate. This case appears to be the first of its kind. An excerpt of the plaintiffs' complaint is provided below:</p>
<p>(Omitted above) After the death of our maternal grandfather, the defendants petitioned this court for a certificate to manage the estate. However, after the defendants began managing the estate, they only knew how to waste it and failed to divide it according to the law. We have repeatedly urged them to distribute our rightful share, but the defendants, intending to embezzle the estate, have repeatedly refused. An interpretation by the Judicial Yuan has confirmed that grandchildren can inherit by substitution. Specifically, Order No. 405 of the Judicial Yuan, dated January 19, 1931, stated that after receiving a request from the Shanghai Bar Association to interpret ambiguities regarding a married woman's inheritance rights, the request was forwarded to the Supreme Court, which stated that since men and women should have equal property inheritance rights, if a married woman who legally has the right to inherit property has already passed away before the commencement of the inheritance, the property that the woman should have inherited should be inherited by her direct lineal descendants. Furthermore, regardless of whether a woman is married or unmarried, if she has the right to inherit property, then she should be jointly responsible with her brothers for her parents' debts if her estate is insufficient to cover them and there is no limited inheritance. If her parents have no other children, then she should be solely responsible for repaying the debts. Furthermore, current law does not grant women the right to inherit ancestral property, so they cannot claim to manage, divide, or receive interest from property used for ancestral worship. Order No. 424 of the Judicial Yuan, dated February 2, 1931, stated that after receiving a request from the Shanghai Bar Association to interpret ambiguities regarding a married woman's inheritance rights, the request was forwarded to the Supreme Court, which stated that if a married woman with the right to inherit property dies before the commencement of the inheritance, her share should be inherited by her children by substitution. However, if the property that she should have inherited has already been divided by other heirs before the implementation of the Detailed Rules for Retrospective Inheritance of Property by Married Women, attention should be paid to the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Detailed Rules. The defendants have dared to disregard national laws, seized the estate, and intend to embezzle it, which is extremely illegal. Therefore, we file this lawsuit. Because the entire estate has been seized, we cannot determine its exact value. One-sixth of it is temporarily calculated at 200,000 yuan. We also declare...</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren of the Special District Local Court opened the Ninth Civil Court to hear the case. The plaintiffs' lawyers, Yang Linzhi, Zhang Jiahui, and Ye Shaoying, and the defendant Xue Yansheng's lawyers, Lin Yingqing and Wang Zijian, all appeared in court to argue their cases. Judge Zhou stated that since the plaintiffs had estimated the value of the subject of the lawsuit to be 200,000 yuan and had not yet paid the required court fees, the court could not proceed with the trial. He ordered the trial to be postponed until the court fees were paid.</p>
<h3>Sheng Yuyou Accuses Cousin of Stealing 100,000 Yuan in Savings</h3>
<p>When His Stepmother Sheng Gong Passed Away</p>
<p>Her Nephew Took the Opportunity to Steal</p>
<p>Sheng Yuyou, the grandson of Sheng Xingxun, a former palace guardian of the Qing Dynasty, currently residing at 526 Jing'an Temple Road, recently hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to accuse his stepmother Sheng Gong's nephew, Mao Zengnian (also known as Mao Dongsheng), of theft in the Special District Court. The complaint alleges that Mao Zengnian, the nephew of the plaintiff's stepmother Sheng Gong, has been residing at 526 Sheng Residence, Jing'an Temple Road. On the afternoon of the 18th of this month at 8:00 PM, the plaintiff's stepmother passed away. The defendant, taking advantage of the absence of Sheng's family members, secretly stole Gong's savings deposit books from the Four Ming Bank and Shanghai Bank, Kadlu Branch, and Wuzhen, totaling 100,000 yuan, along with a set of seals. Afterwards, an investigation was conducted at various banks, and it was discovered that the defendant had already withdrawn a portion of Gong's savings from the Shanghai Bank, totaling 20,000 taels of silver, and had disappeared without a trace. The plaintiff is the adopted son of the third branch of the Sheng family and, according to law, should have the right to inherit his stepmother Sheng Gong's estate. The defendant's actions clearly violate the criminal law. In addition to reporting the case to the police, this complaint is filed requesting that the defendant be investigated and prosecuted according to the law, along with a civil lawsuit and a request to instruct the aforementioned banks to prohibit the defendant from withdrawing any deposits under Sheng Gong's Wuzhen account to prevent further losses. It is reported that the court has received the complaint and will soon summon both parties to appear in court for a hearing.</p>
<h3>Request to Ban Gambling in Amusement Parks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, We are writing to you in response to a letter from Mr. Zhu Rongping, who stated that gambling is a major scourge on public morals and fraud is intolerable under national law. The happiness of the people and the stability of society are all related to this issue. Therefore, dog racing and roulette are prohibited by law. However, activities similar to these are still rampant, harming the ignorant masses. It has been found that the rooftop gardens of the Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun department stores, as well as the New World amusement park, all have gambling-like activities, such as winning prizes by ringing bells, obtaining cigarettes through roulette, and profiting from ring toss games. In terms of their content, all of them involve fraudulent activities. The so-called "winning prizes by ringing bells" never offers any large prizes. The attempt to make a profit from ring toss games always involves deceiving the ignorant masses through unclear pricing and the convenient pursuit of profit. If questioned, they resort to beatings, stripping of clothes, and other evil acts. As for roulette for cigarettes, regardless of what is being gambled, it is fundamentally a violation of the law. Therefore, ignorant people who enter these places are bound to be swindled. Therefore, we are writing to request that your council investigate this fraudulent situation and ban these activities, so that visitors will no longer be deceived and your council's commitment to banning gambling will be fully implemented. The benefits of this would be immense." The association believes that the contents of the letter are insightful and related to the harmfulness of gambling. Therefore, we are writing to request that your Bureau investigate and prohibit these activities.</p>
<h3>Soochow University Invites Ms. Liu Manqing to Lecture</h3>
<p>Soochow University in Shanghai has always paid close attention to the issue of China's border regions. It has established a Border Studies Association to study all aspects of the border regions. The university recently heard that Ms. Liu Manqing, who traveled to Tibet alone two years ago to conduct research, had recently come to Shanghai. They specially asked Mr. Huang Jingwan of the Commercial Press to introduce her. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, she came to the university to lecture. Also in attendance were Gesang Zeren, a special commissioner of the Sichuan-Xikang Party Affairs, Yang Zhonghua, an aide, Huang Ziyi, and Ms. Liu Manqing's sister, Ms. Liu Manyun. President Liu Zhanen of the university extended a warm welcome and gathered all 800 male and female students in the auditorium to listen to Ms. Liu's lecture. Ms. Liu calmly took the stage and said, "I was born on the border and have limited knowledge. I feel both ashamed and honored to be invited by Shanghai's highest institution of learning to give a lecture. The issue of the border regions has long been neglected by the Chinese people. In addition, for the past ten years or so, the government and scholars have been out of touch with Tibet, and the situation has become even more isolated. Two years ago, I was ordered to go to Tibet to conduct research. This was a rash undertaking. The climate in Tibet is extremely cold, the mountain passes are covered in snow that is several meters deep, the roads are rugged, and bandits are everywhere. The hardships I experienced are beyond description. However, because I was on a mission, I did not dare to give up despite the setbacks. Fortunately, I managed to reach Lhasa and meet with the Dalai Lama to convey the central government's intentions. The result was satisfactory. The Dalai Lama, who had been out of touch with the government for more than ten years, has now sent a plenipotentiary representative to reside permanently in Beijing. In the future, relations between China and Tibet will gradually become closer. All I have contributed in recent years is this. I hope that you will be able to conduct more solid, on-the-ground research on Tibet in the future. With your vast knowledge, you will surely achieve more and contribute more to the border regions. This is my hope." Next, Mr. Gesang Zeren gave a speech, saying, "China's inland areas are densely populated. Young people with ambitions and knowledge have no way out. Xikang and Tibet, on the other hand, are vast and sparsely populated, with abundant treasures. However, due to the lack of talent, no one is developing them, and they will inevitably remain remote and desolate areas. Your university's insight is commendable, and your establishment of the Border Studies Association to engage in exploration is admirable. I hope that in the future, your slogan will be 'Go to the border regions,' because going to the border regions is the only true way out for us. I have been in the inland for three years and have made no contributions to my hometown. I am deeply ashamed of this. I have now been ordered by the central government to return to Xikang to handle party affairs and to inspect the political and cultural situation. In Xikang, in addition to promoting party principles, I also intend to work hard on cultural undertakings. I hope that in the near future, you will come to my humble and remote land. I will welcome you wholeheartedly. When I return to Xikang, I also intend to select students from various places and send them to the inland to study at your university. I hope you will provide guidance." After Mr. Gesang's speech, President Liu invited Mr. Fu, an American sociologist, to give a speech. Mr. Fu also came to meet Ms. Liu because of her lecture at the university. After the meeting, President Liu hosted a luncheon at his residence. Mr. Fu and Mr. Huang Jingwan were also in attendance. Mr. Fu heard that Ms. Liu had written a book about her journey to Tibet, "Kangzang Zhaozheng," which will soon be published by the Commercial Press, and he greatly admired it. He plans to translate it into English for people in his country to read. At the same time, many students at the university asked Mr. Gesang and Ms. Liu to sign autographs as souvenirs, and President Liu and his wife especially entertained them and said that if students from Xikang wanted to study at the university, they would be given free preferential treatment and assistance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai to Have a Very Large Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>A Beauty Contest to Be Held</p>
<p>Since the Ming Garden closed, it has been reorganized into a large amusement park. The interior work is extremely busy. A canopy eighty feet high has been built to accommodate a thousand workers who are building the swimming pool day and night. The design of this swimming pool is scientific, hygienic, and extremely safe. The pool area is about two hundred feet long and just under one hundred and twenty feet wide. The shallow end is only two feet deep for children to swim in, and the deep end is thirteen feet deep. It has a storage capacity of one million gallons of water. The pool water is changed frequently, and it is stipulated that every two hours it must undergo a scientific sterilization process. Every morning, the pool will be cleaned and wiped, and then the water will be refilled. Water samples will be tested regularly to ensure that there are no toxins that could harm the human body or skin. The park has one thousand shower rooms with one hundred hot and cold water faucets. All kinds of diving boards, water slides, swimming rings, and large rubber rings for children to float on are readily available. There are also various new and beautiful bathing suits for rent. The shallow water beach is covered with white sand, and the beach is equipped with colorful large parasols and tea tables. There is also a radio station that broadcasts music day and night. At the same time, there are plans to hold an unprecedented international beauty contest. The contest is scheduled to begin in August or September. This contest will be guaranteed by Shanghai's socialite charitable organizations. A percentage of the ticket revenue will be used for charitable purposes. The contest will be held in two stages. The first stage will be a contest for women from Russia, France, Germany, and England. The second stage, in August, will be a contest for Chinese women. In the third and final stage, the beauty queens selected in the previous stages will compete in a final election. The judges will select the most beautiful woman, who will be crowned Miss Seas and given the title of "Beautiful Queen," and the committee will award her a beautiful gift. This beauty contest and other novel entertainment activities that Shanghai has never seen before will be held at the Ming Garden this summer. The opening date is in July, and it will surely draw crowds from all over Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Water Supply Dispute in Nanshun Jinli, Feihong Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>Authorities Order Owners to Connect to Tap Water</p>
<p>Residents of Nanshun Jinli, Feihong Road, Zhabei, mainly rely on well water</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>There are three sets of public taps, but the water flow is not smooth. Most of the residents are working class, and more than ten people often draw water at the same time. The taps are too few to meet the demand, and disputes often arise. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, after receiving a report, ordered the owner, Chen Yelan, to add more taps or connect to Zhabei tap water to facilitate drinking water. Subsequently, Chen Yelan replied that Nos. 1 to 34 of the alley belong to the three owners Kang Shaonian, Shi Gan, and Gu Hu, and only Nos. 35 to 71 belong to Chen. The original three taps are sufficient for his own use, but because the properties of Kang and others do not have water supply facilities, they also pay a fee to use the taps, resulting in a shortage. The Bureau considered this a violation of the water supply rules, which state that owners who have their own water supply cannot supply water to properties outside their own. Chen was ordered to stop supplying well water to residents outside his own properties, and Kang, Shi, and Hu were strictly ordered to connect to tap water before the 15th of this month to supply drinking water to the residents of their own properties. A notice was also issued to the residents of Nos. 1 to 34 stating that if the owners fail to comply by the deadline, the residents can apply to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company for tap water on their own, and all expenses will be deducted from their rent.</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of the Supervisory and Executive Committees of the Jisheng Society</h3>
<p>Report on Disaster Relief Efforts in Nine Provinces This Year</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Society in Shanghai held a joint meeting of the Supervisory and Executive Committees the day before yesterday to discuss disaster relief efforts in the nine provinces of Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Liaoning, Rehe, Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Chairman Wang Yiting attended on behalf of the Society, with Vice-Chairman Huang Hanzhi substituting. More than 20 people attended the meeting, including Vice-Chairman Huang, Vice-Chairman Xu Qianlin, and committee members Qu Junwen and Zhang Junxianqing. Reports were given on the current situation of disaster relief, which are summarized below: (1) Committee Member Zhang Xianqing reported on disaster relief efforts in Nanchang and other counties in Jiangxi Province. The Society is jointly running the Nanchang Refugee Shelter and the Ji'an Refugee Shelter with the Morality Society. The two societies have previously allocated 3,000 yuan to the Nanchang shelter and 4,000 yuan to the Ji'an shelter. Another 4,000 yuan has been allocated, as well as more than 2,980 yuan for emergency relief and 5,000 yuan for disaster relief in Guangchang, more than 5,200 sets of cotton clothes worth more than 11,000 yuan, and other disaster relief expenses totaling more than 30,000 yuan. (2) A disaster relief director stated that the Zhejiang Ninghai Dike Gate project is continuing. The original project of building 70-odd dikes in Youdu, Zhongdu, and Xuepo villages is nearing completion. Recently, Mr. Ye Shenzibu of Ninghai proposed to add three dikes connected to the village, namely Chuandong, Xinpingyan, and Laopingyan, to complete the project. In addition to raising funds locally, there is still a shortage of 14,000 yuan. This meeting will consider ways to make up the difference. A letter has also been received from Mr. Sun Yinting, who stated that the local people have requested the repair of dikes in Xiaojian Village and other places in Maolin District. This project is very important and requires 6,200 yuan. The Society, considering the long-term importance of water conservancy, consulted with Vice-Chairman Huang Hanzhi and Committee Member Qu Wenliu and decided to raise funds to assist. The funds have been transferred to the project's disaster relief director, Yinting, to proceed. (3) Committee Member Qu Wenliu stated that the three bridges in Linhai, Zhejiang, namely the Qiaogong Bridge, the Xidong Bridge, and the Yangdu Bridge, have now been completed. After the construction of these three bridges, the local people were inspired to build more than a dozen bridges, all in the name of the Jisheng Society. The Society paid for the labor costs, and the materials were donated locally. Therefore, the Society's investment of 40,000 yuan was equivalent to 100,000 yuan in materials and labor. Zhongdu Bridge is larger, and Mr. Li Yunmen initially tried to build it, but construction was halted due to the difficulty of driving piles. If the weather is favorable and the procedures are legal, 40,000 yuan would be enough to complete it. Funds are now available, but only 15,000 yuan, leaving a shortage of 30,000 yuan. Due to the difficulty of working in the water, the project will be delayed until the second half of the year, but the goal is to complete it. (4) A disaster relief director also went to Shaanxi for disaster relief. Last year, a total of 437,000 yuan was disbursed. This year, Mr. Li Yunmen went to investigate and continue disaster relief in Wugong, running four porridge kitchens, two disaster orphan shelters, and providing seeds, burying corpses, and emergency relief in Liquan, Qianxian, Jingyang, and Lanzhou counties, totaling about 117,000 yuan. Together with the various disaster relief funds mentioned above, the total amount used is about 550,000 to 600,000 yuan. (5) It was also stated that the Society runs three porridge kitchens in Beiping: Baiyian, Landianchang, and Sanshucun. Emergency relief in Xuanhua has been increased from 10,000 yuan to 17,000 yuan. From January 1st to May 30th of this year, a total of more than 37,000 yuan has been allocated for porridge kitchens and emergency relief, and more than 15,000 sets of disaster relief clothing have been provided. The Society's increased disaster relief in Xuanhua has also extended the county's porridge kitchens for three months. (6) In Suizhong, Liaoning Province, the Society runs three porridge kitchens in Xiaozhuangzi, Daquezhuangzi, and Dawangzhuangzi, using a total of more than 25,200 yuan for disaster relief. An additional 15,000 yuan was allocated for dry food. Mr. Yang Zigong, chairman of the charity associations in the four provinces of Rehe, Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, allocated 5,000 yuan in the Society's name for disaster relief grain, totaling 20,000 yuan. 11,000 sets of cotton clothes were also provided. (7) Five porridge kitchens are planned for the Chaoyang porridge kitchen in Rehe. The Society allocated 10,000 yuan, and Zhu Zila allocated 10,000 yuan. The project is currently underway. However, the disaster is severe, and 5,000 yuan must be added to each kitchen to sustain them. (8) In Liuan, Anhui, the Society's Mr. Feng Yangshan and Mr. Zepu went there and distributed emergency relief funds in two installments over the past two years, totaling more than 30,000 yuan, including disaster relief expenses. The report has now been filed. (9) The Yangli River project in Henan Province was started last year, but the work was less than halfway done due to military interference. Now, it cannot proceed because of the flood, and the Society's finances are strained. It can only be discussed again next spring, depending on the financial situation. The bridge and gate projects in the county are urgent. The Nanyang Jisheng Branch has asked engineer Xu to handle it. The original estimate was 5,000 yuan, and 4,000 yuan has already been disbursed. There is still 1,000 yuan outstanding. The project is 80% complete. The disaster situation in Henan is very serious. The province has repeatedly sent documents and telegrams requesting assistance. Because of the shortage of disaster relief funds, the Society only chose to assist Mianchi County and appointed Mr. Feng Yangshan as the disaster relief director. The original allocation was 30,000 yuan. However, it was found that there were more than 20,000 disaster-stricken households, with an average of six people per household, meaning that there were more than 120,000 disaster victims. It was impossible to distribute 30,000 yuan. An additional 25,000 yuan has now been added, bringing the total to 55,000 yuan. It is still necessary to carefully review and make adjustments. (10) Regarding the floods in Huaiyin, Jiangsu Province, and the bandit disasters in Siyang, the Society is jointly working with the Jiangsu Temporary Disaster Relief Association. Because the disaster situation is serious, the Society has added 3,000 yuan to each county. Because epidemics are rampant in the two disaster areas, the Society is sending 5,000 bottles each of Jisheng Dan and Shidi Shui, and 500 boxes of Bao'an Dan to the disaster areas for disaster relief. A philanthropist in Huaian donated 7,500 yuan for farmland and an additional 1,500 yuan, totaling 9,000 yuan, to assist disaster relief in Suqian and Siyang counties. Such acts of kindness and selflessness are worthy of emulation. The Society has published an article in the newspaper to commend them. (11) The Society is currently carrying out disaster relief in nine provinces. In addition to the funds that have already been paid, there are still outstanding payments (list available separately), totaling a shortfall of 152,600 yuan. With such a shortage of disaster relief funds, the Society cannot ignore the disasters that need to be addressed. The only hope is that the Society's comrades and philanthropists will do their best to promote and support the cause, so that disaster victims can survive and blessings will be immeasurable. We who live in safety on the sea, whenever we think of the suffering of the disaster victims, we should each do our best to find ways to provide relief. Saving one more person is one more act of merit. Everyone was deeply moved by this. Member Wang Yao臣 immediately pledged 1,000 yuan for disaster relief in Shaanxi. The director and vice chair were recommended by many of the public; his experience is deep, yet his rope is short; he is afraid of being unequal to the task. With the arrival of such a great disaster, if he waits for enough disaster relief funds to be raised before providing relief, the disaster victims will already be in the ditches. He has no choice but to plan ahead. Last year, he had no choice but to borrow 100,000 yuan, which has been gradually repaid, but now there is another shortfall of 150,000 yuan. He hopes that all his comrades will understand God's great virtue and intention to give life. With such widespread calamities, philanthropists across the country will unite to provide relief, and many people will surely join the Society. The public unanimously agreed. After discussing various internal matters of the Society, the meeting was adjourned with a bell.</p>

<h3>Second Meeting of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bond Management Committee</h3>
<p>Silk factory representatives request flexible measures</p>
<p>Management based on Article 3 of the regulations</p>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bond Management Committee held its second executive committee meeting yesterday at 9 a.m. at the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau of the Ministry of Industry on Sanma Road. Attendees included Zheng Hongnian, Vice Minister of Industry; Management Committee members Mu Ouchu, Zou Bingwen, Shen Huachen, Lu Shutang, Chu Huisheng, Qian Fenghao; silk experts Zhou Tingding, Zheng Bijiang, Ge Jingzhong; and Cheng Zhenjun, totaling eleven people. Zheng Hongnian, acting as temporary chairman, recorded the discussion as follows:</p>
<p>Discussion: Regarding the allocation of public bonds, according to Article 3 of the Silk Industry Public Bond Regulations, two-fourths of the total 8 million yuan were originally intended to incentivize silk exports and aid the silk industry, one-fourth for improving silk factory machinery, and one-fourth for improving sericulture. During yesterday's discussion, Shen, Chu, and Qian from the silk factory side suggested that the silk industry's situation has been deteriorating over the past two years, especially this year, with almost all Shanghai factories ceasing operations recently. Therefore, to aid the silk industry, the immediate solution should be to maintain the status quo. While improving the silk industry is also urgent, it should only be discussed after the silk industry stabilizes. They requested that the 2 million yuan for improving machinery be temporarily used to aid the silk industry as an emergency measure. After a lengthy discussion, the chairman deemed the suggestion inappropriate, believing that improvement and aid are separate matters, and the public bond regulations were stipulated by the Legislative Yuan and cannot be illegally altered. Later, Chu Huisheng explained that the silk industry was requesting flexibility, not alteration. As a result, the chairman asked the silk experts to research and determine a plan, with further discussion scheduled for the next, third meeting.</p>
<p>Resolutions: The following resolutions were passed: (1) Ge Jingzhong, Chu Huisheng, and Mu Ouchu were elected as standing committee members. (2) The liaison office was decided to be the staff of the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in contact with Guo Bingwen. (3) The detailed rules of procedure will be drafted by Committee Member Mu Ouchu and discussed by the Standing Committee. (4) The public bond allocation plan will be based on the allocation standards stipulated in Article 3 of the public bond regulations, with the committee discussing the plan and submitting a proposal to the ministry for approval. (5) The third executive committee meeting will be held next Monday afternoon. As for the flexible measures requested by the silk factory representatives, it is said that a decision will be made at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Customs Declaration Method for Transporting Native Goods</h3>
<p>Must be reported to the Customs at the port of departure</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs received an order from the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating that merchants transporting native goods with fixed tax receipts from one commercial port to another, passing through foreign ports, or from a commercial port through Dalian to various locations in the three northeastern provinces, must submit a written pledge to the customs at the port of departure at the time of declaration. The pledge must state that the goods being transported are indeed the original goods and have not been altered or replaced. The goods must arrive at the port of destination within three months from the date of declaration. The order instructed compliance and adherence. Upon receiving the order, the Jianghai Customs immediately notified all merchants to comply.</p>
<h3>Bookbinding Industry Scheduled to Resume Work Today</h3>
<p>Signatures Not Achieved Yesterday</p>
<p>The third strike by workers in the Chinese and foreign bookbinding industry in this city has lasted for nine days. While foreign bookbinding has resumed work, Chinese bookbinding has not yet complied. Signatures were not achieved yesterday. Since the authorities' deadline has passed, the union sent representatives again to persuade the workers, who have agreed to resume work today. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Signatures Not Achieved: Pu Xieji, represented by Pu Fenglai, and Tang Pinji, represented by Kang Aping, whose proposed solutions, after discussions with worker representatives, were opposed by all colleagues. Yesterday, they sent a letter to worker representative Lu Axiang, stating, "We acknowledge the excellent negotiations conducted yesterday between your representatives and us regarding the resumption of work. However, this labor dispute arose from your union's reorganization efforts, and your representatives and we are in private capacities. Therefore, we bear no responsibility for the matters discussed yesterday. If your union is truly sincere about resuming work, please submit a written proposal to our association for legal discussion." Later, worker representative Zhang Jinhong arrived to represent Pu Fenglai, but Pu Fenglai and others refused to sign, and first resumed work. The bookbinding union, to comply with the order, sent maintenance team members again yesterday morning with notices to various workshops to persuade workers, and they have all agreed to resume work today and await a resolution. The East Team included Huang Songhe and Yu A'gen; the South Team included Chen Xiaosong and Pu Xiguang; the West Team included Feng Shaoquan and Lu Jianqiu; the North Team included Chao Guosheng and Shen Changjiang, totaling over twenty people. They returned to the union at 4 p.m., each reporting that workers had agreed to resume work today and await a resolution.</p>
<p>Capitalists Petition: The Bookbinding Industry Association sent representatives Li Guangzu, Zhu Muyun, and others to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to petition for strict action against illegal strikes. Wang Bing received their report on recent developments and instructed them to follow the authorities' announcements. They then went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition for assistance in maintaining commercial difficulties. Zheng Chengqing received them and agreed to forward the matter to the Social Affairs Bureau for legal review.</p>

<h3>Japanese Deputy Returns to Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Arrived on the Yueyang Maru</p>
<p>Shigemitsu Aoi, the acting Japanese Minister to China, went to Beijing at the beginning of the month to continue discussions with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on issues such as legal rights and Sino-Japanese reparations. Yesterday, Shigemitsu, along with secretaries Horii and Moriya, returned to Shanghai from Shimonoseki on the Japanese ship Yueyang Maru.

<h3>Ningbo Compatriots Feast Wu Jingxiong</h3>
<p>This afternoon at the Ningbo Association</p>
<p>Shanghai-based Ningbo natives such as Yu Qiaqing are hosting a banquet at noon today in the association's lecture hall to honor Dr. Wu Jingxiong, a fellow Ningbo native and newly appointed municipal advisor to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, to strengthen local ties.</p>
<h3>County Government Appoints Property Management Director</h3>
<p>Zheng Jiang Shijie, Deputy Kang Yongnian</p>
<p>Qin Xitian, director of the Shanghai County Public Funds and Property Management Office, and Shen Zhou, deputy director, have submitted letters to the county government requesting approval to resign due to the expiration of their terms. County Chief Yan believes that the director and deputy director have been deeply involved in their duties for many years and have been invaluable assistants, so he should not hastily approve their resignations. However, as they have already served one term, it is difficult to retain them due to regulations. It has been found that Jiang Shijie (Zhujun), former director of the Minhang Township Administration Bureau, and Kang Yongnian (Jimin), former director of Caoxing Township, are qualified to be appointed as the director and deputy director of the Property Management Office. Yesterday, in addition to sending letters to Jiang and Kang instructing them to report to the office for duty immediately, he also sent letters to Director Qin and Shen instructing them to check and report on the handover.</p>
<h3>Japanese Sailors Suddenly Want to Cooperate with Chinese Sailors</h3>
<p>Japanese Seek a Way Out</p>
<p>Not Initially Loving Chinese People</p>
<p>The Japanese Seamen's Union, which has established a Shanghai branch, is a collection of maritime personnel from various shipping companies, mainly composed of lower-ranking sailors. In recent years, the Japanese shipping industry has been facing a downturn, with excessive tonnage and increasing numbers of unemployed sailors. In order to find a way out, the Seamen's Union first established a branch in Hong Kong, welcoming Chinese sailors to join in order to achieve the internationalization of maritime personnel. Recently, with the decline in Japanese shipping operations, Japanese sailors realized that they could not find a new way out without uniting with Chinese sailors. Therefore, they decided to send personnel to Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of a Shanghai branch of the Japanese Seamen's Union, in cooperation with a portion of the Chinese sailors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to form a united front. This is currently being organized.</p>
<p>Decision to Make Demands: After the Japanese and Chinese sailors cooperate and unite, they have decided to make demands of the British and Japanese shipping companies. Generally, at a time when gold prices are soaring and business is depressed, the British and Japanese shipping companies should employ Chinese sailors for the lower-ranking positions on all ships, except for the senior officers. This would not only save the huge expenditure of paying salaries in gold coins but also because Chinese sailors are better at the work than sailors from other countries. This action by the Japanese is not initially to find a way out for Chinese sailors. They know that the number of Chinese sailors with specialized maritime skills is insufficient. They are using the name of Chinese sailors' low salaries and excellent work to, in reality, encourage European countries to employ more Japanese sailors as crew members in the future.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Social Affairs Bureau's Recruitment of Factory Inspectors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, having previously received an order from the Municipal Government to forward the Factory Inspector Training Institute Rules and Factory Inspector Training Methods issued by the Ministry of Industry, was instructed to review and report. After receiving the order, the bureau immediately published advertisements to recruit trainees. After two rounds, the following were officially selected: Niu Yinchu, Liu Guangyu, Lu Jicang, Li Zongpu, Yu Gangfu, Jiang Zhiyong, Jiang Shuren, Zhao Yu, Yang Shangzhuo, and Yu Yuese, totaling ten people. The following were selected as alternates: Jiang Zhongren and Ye Yunrong, totaling two people. Since the number of trainees selected was still insufficient, the bureau recommended its own employees Tian Heqing, Guo Yongxi, and Wang Jian to enter the institute for training. It is reported that the selected trainees have been notified to report and pay fees at the Ministry of Industry Factory Inspector Training Institute at 130 Wuding Road on the designated date and to attend classes, and the matter has been reported to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the Ministry of Industry for record.</p>
<h3>Sanbei Company's Changan Steamer Runs Aground on Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The stranded Sanbei Company Yangtze River steamer Changan was originally planning to go to Changsha, Hunan after going to Shashi from Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, at 9:00 p.m., while traveling to the river surface about 20 miles away from Jianli, the water level was sharply falling. The ship ran aground on a shoal, and the hull was deeply mired in the sand.</p>
<p>Towing: On the second day after being stranded, the water level was only eight feet, and the bottom of the ship was wrapped in the sand. While considering towing, the Ningshao Company's Yongxing steamer also happened to be passing by after sailing from Hankou. Seeing the Changan stranded, it tried to tow it, but the force was insufficient due to the shallow water, so it stopped towing and sent a telegram to Shanghai to report and seek a solution.</p>
<p>Waiting for the Tide: According to a telegram from Hankou yesterday, the water level in Jianli is only eight meters, making navigation very difficult. A slight mishap could lead to disaster. The area where the Changan is stranded is also only eight feet deep, making it impossible for ships with deeper drafts to approach and tow. It is now necessary to wait for the tide to rise to ten feet before towing can be attempted. It is not yet known whether the bottom of the Changan has been damaged and it will be necessary to wait for the tide to rise and tow it out before inspecting it.</p>
<h3>Minghe Steamer Abandoned and Not Salvaged</h3>
<p>The entire ship sank into the sand</p>
<p>The crew was rescued by the Fengpu</p>
<p>After the Sanbei Company's Minghe steamer ran aground on a reef at Peacock Port in Beihai Prefecture, Saisui Prefecture last month, the bureau sent the Fengpu steamer to rescue it. It took almost a month until yesterday, when a telegram was received from Suisui Prefecture stating that after the Minghe steamer ran aground on the reef, it was surrounded by sand and mud due to the impact of the tide. It is now impossible to tow it, and even the Fengpu steamer can only anchor three thousand feet away from the Minghe and cannot get any closer. Therefore, after inspection by the technicians, it can only be completely abandoned and not salvaged. The small sampan boats have now begun to transfer the Minghe's crew and sailors to safety, and the parts of the ship that can be disassembled are also being loaded onto the Fengpu steamer for transport back to Shanghai. The Minghe steamer is a top-notch ship of the Sanbei Company, valued at over 400,000 yuan, with a load capacity of over 2,000 tons and covered by Ping An marine insurance. This complete loss will amount to at least 400,000 yuan, but it will be borne by the insurance company.</p>
<h3>Post Office Limits Domestic Parcel Weight</h3>
<p>Increased from 10 kg to 20 kg</p>
<p>The Shanghai Post Office stated that the weight limit for domestic parcels has now been increased from 10 kg to 20 kg. For parcels sent to and from places not connected by domestic ships and trains, the size limit has also been changed to be the same as those sent to and from places connected by ships and trains. This change will be implemented on a trial basis for one year. Details can be inquired at various post offices.</p>
<h3>Passport Inspection Office Cracks Down on Foreigners Entering China Without Passports</h3>
<p>One Fijian was deported to his home country</p>
<p>Two Russians were sent to the bureau for handling</p>
<p>The Passport Inspection Office of the Public Security Bureau's Foreign Affairs Section has been working smoothly on inspecting incoming foreigners recently. However, on the Da Lai Company's President Taft, which arrived on Tuesday of this week, a Fijian named (TerroAcompauode) was found to have no passport or other supporting documents. The Fijian was prohibited from landing and the Da Lai Company was instructed to arrange for his return to his home country. Also, on the Japanese ship Tangshan Maru, which arrived on Wednesday of this week, a Russian couple (Pygakdg) was found to have no passports. At that time, the inspectors of the inspection office prohibited them from landing and they have now been sent to the Public Security Bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>New Look for Sino-Western Pharmacy</h3>
<p>Subscription is about to be fully subscribed</p>
<p>The contract for Zhou Bangjun, the original manager of the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Fourth Avenue, to take over the business, was formally signed on the 4th of this month. The pharmacy is an established and safe business with a history of forty-four years and an exceptionally broad scope of business. The results of the stock subscription have been very satisfactory in recent days. Since the advertisement for the takeover was published, those who have come to subscribe for shares and pay money have flocked in. As of last night, the amount has reached over 50,000 yuan. In addition, depositors have automatically converted their savings into shares, amounting to 10,000 yuan. According to Zhou, under this situation, the subscription will be fully subscribed soon. It is also heard that the articles of association stipulate that female shareholders can also be elected as directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>Commercial Press Publishes Moganshan Map</h3>
<p>Moganshan is full of bamboo and the scenery is beautiful, not only is it a famous summer resort, but also a wonderful place for health preservation. Recently, climbers have been visiting in droves, but unfortunately there is no good map for reference to the newly opened mountain roads and famous scenic spots. Now, someone with many years of experience on the mountain has surveyed and mapped a map on the ground. All the mountain road names, house numbers, and famous scenic spots are clearly marked in detail. It is exquisitely printed in two colors and each copy only sells for two dimes. In addition to the Shanghai and Hangzhou China Travel Service and the Shanghai Minjie Bookstore acting as agents, an agreement has also been made with the Commercial Press to sell them. Those who visit the mountain can purchase them from the bookstore.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Art Riding Fan Painting Collaboration Exhibition</h3>
<p>As the weather has gradually become hotter, fan painting exhibitions have sprung up like clouds and wind. Famous Shanghai calligraphers and painters Wang Yiting, Yang Du, Ye Bogao, Luo Lianggong, Qian Huafo, Huang Binhong, Yao Yujiang, Yi Nan, Meng Shuzhi and more than thirty others, are holding a collaborative fan painting exhibition at the Art Riding Calligraphy and Painting Association at the intersection of Sanma Road and Yunnan Road, starting today. On-site brush strokes and pricing will be affordable, with each page only costing one to five yuan. Various ancient paintings collected by the Hongxue master are also displayed upstairs, welcoming visitors from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Newly Invented Shunfeng Brand Silk Stockings</h3>
<p>There are many silk stockings on the market, but those that are strong, affordable, and do not fade after washing are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Shunfeng brand silk stockings are now the most common silk stockings on the market, with excellent quality, durability, and color that does not fade or pill after washing. Recently, a new type of women's silk stockings has been invented, which is the latest style in 1931. The colors are more fashionable in tin gray and yellow. According to the Shunfeng Brand Silk Stocking Factory at the north end of Sanmaoge Bridge, more than twenty dozen of these stockings are sold every day, especially to female students. A large supply of summer supplies such as undershirts and shorts is also available.</p>
<h3>Business Development of Yonghe Industrial Company</h3>
<p>Since the rise of gold and the fall of silver, the prices of all daily necessities imported from foreign countries have increased several times. Even for cosmetics, a small tube of toothpaste must cost at least one yuan, totaling about 50 million yuan throughout the year. The outflow of money is a great sigh. The Yonghe Industrial Company in the Old North Gate of this port has been improving all the products it has already sold in recent years. The two products, "Chang'e Brand" tooth powder and toothpaste, have annual sales of more than two million. In addition, the company's chemical engineer, Ye Meijun, is always working to improve them. Therefore, the company's products, no matter what kind, are better than those from foreign countries. Overseas Chinese businessmen in places as far away as the Nanyang Islands, Singapore, and Java welcome and use them, and the prices are more than half as cheap as foreign goods. This is truly the glory of the national goods industry and the pride of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Dental Hygiene Society Recruiting Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dental Hygiene Society at 122 Old Bazimen Road, North Sichuan Road, has been established for less than a year and has already won the trust of society, with more than 400 members. It is heard that the association is recruiting the second session of members from the 6th of this month to the 7th of July in order to popularize dental hygiene. Members are divided into adult members and children's members. Adult and child members both pay a membership fee of two dollars to be entitled to twice teeth cleaning and examination each year. Children will get an extra twice teeth examination and free baby teeth extractions. All members are given especially favourable prices for dental filling, medication, and extractions. They will indeed earn practical benefits with a small membership fee.</p>
<h3>Honour of 4711 Cosmetics</h3>
<p>German 4711 cosmetics are famous in Europe and the United States and are popular among ladies in China. The Chinese manager of the factory, Meizuishi Foreign Company, recently received a telegram from Germany informing that the factory's 4711 products have been appointed for the use of the British Crown Prince, which shows the quality of the brand.</p>
<h3>Hongzhen Fire</h3>

<h3>News from Various Labor Unions</h3>
<p>Declaration by Various Labor Unions in the Fifth District Against the Atrocities of American Sailors: It is said that there must be no docile people in a country of rapists. American imperialists have always used the guise of a civilized country to appeal to the world, but in reality, their weaknesses are exposed and they cannot defend themselves. It is a self-deception that the world already agrees upon. Recently, tragic cases have emerged one after another in Shanghai, a small place. Since the shooting of Gu Jingen by American sailors, there have been continuous incidents of American sailors committing violence while drunk, American sailors pushing people into the Huangpu River, and American sailors wielding knives to kill people, causing death or injury and splattering blood. Public opinion is spreading and shocking the world. At this time, our country is abolishing unequal treaties, yet the imperialists dare to be so rampant, acting lawlessly within our country's territory. The so-called army of a self-proclaimed civilized country openly holds knives to kill people, what will uncivilized countries do? Now, the dead cannot be revived, the injured are gasping for breath, negotiations have not yet been successful, the dead drink their hatred in the afterlife, and the injured pillow their grievances. What could be more heartbreaking than this? It concerns the survival of the nation. Punishing the perpetrators and providing compensation are only temporary solutions. Recovering extraterritoriality is the only way to eliminate the harm permanently. Preserving the country and seeking survival is a clear and ancient teaching. May all our compatriots in the country share this conviction. (The following omitted) Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, Fifth District Shipbuilding Industry Union, Fifth District Paper Industry Union, Fifth District Stevedoring Union, Fifth District Match Industry Union, Fifth District Altar Industry Union, Fifth District Woodworking Industry Union, Fifth District Garment Union, Fifth District Yellow Wine Production Union, Fifth District Basket Carrier Union, Fifth District Casing Slice Union, Fifth District Civil Ship Repair Union, etc. declare.</p>

(3) Some workers in a certain shop have not joined the union and there is no adequate solution. Doubts have arisen among the members. How should this be handled? It was resolved: A.

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To the editor: Today (6th), your newspaper published a report on the resolution of the bookbinding industry turmoil, which is slightly inconsistent with the facts. On the morning of June 5th, the laborers Zhang Jinhong, Zhang Haosheng, and I had a private conversation at the Wanshang Teahouse in Xinzha Bridge, which was not a formal meeting. At that time, it was stated that we would report to our union based on personal opinions. If a resolution could be reached, a formal signature would be required to be effective. Now, reading the newspaper's report that an agreement had been reached is not in line with the facts. I hereby declare this and request that your newspaper make a correction to clarify the truth. Respectfully, Pu Fenglai from Pudong sends this message to the chief editor of the Shenbao. May 6th.</p>

<p>A cheerful disposition, passionate emotions, a peaceful ambition, and a pure and beautiful appearance: this is my ideal of a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>The most beautiful women in the world are those in paintings and books, otherwise there will inevitably be flaws. Therefore, pursuing women is not as good as reading books and looking at paintings.</p>
<h3>Record of National Martial Arts</h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>Last year, when the national martial arts competition was held in Hangzhou, I met two or three warriors in my spare time. What we talked about before was all trivial stories about national martial arts, among which there were no lack of heroic and chivalrous deeds that were worth discussing. With nothing to do in the rented window, I wetted my brush and wrote them down.</p>
<p>Traveling upstream along the Qiantang River and turning left, there is a county between Jin and Lan called Yiwu. The local customs are bold and brave, and they like to fight. Every spring and autumn, the locals like to hold god-welcoming and racing events. Many aggressive people take the opportunity to set up gambling tables. Those who come throw away their houses and sell their properties, scraping together everything they have. They do not hesitate to bet thousands of gold coins in one go. One day, a young man in fur clothes and horses came with a servant and threw a pile of gold coins on the table with a clanging sound. The gamblers, all outsiders, were even more happy to gamble with him. In an instant, the young man lost two thousand gold coins and his money bag was empty. He got up, straightened his clothes, and left without any sadness. He came again the next day, bringing even more gold than yesterday, and asked to be the dealer. After only a few throws, he had won more than five thousand gold coins. The young man immediately said, "Stop!" He ordered his servant to take the gold he had won and left proudly. The gamblers, seeing that he was delicate and weak, shouted loudly, "Where are you going, guest? Return the money you won, and you will be forgiven. Otherwise, your life will not be guaranteed. Do you still want to seize our money?" The young man was also angry and did not give in at all. The crowd surrounded him and attacked him. The young man laughed and said, "Do you rats want to rob me by force? Please try my fist." As soon as he waved his hand, those who were hit fell more than ten feet away. The crowd took out iron weapons and attacked him. The young man took out the folding fan he was carrying and blocked them. Those who were hit fell. The crowd knew they could not win and dispersed. The young man said, "You rats have only this much skill and you want to bully people with violence?" After saying this, he laughed wildly and left. Later, someone asked about the young man's name. He was Wang, a successful candidate in the imperial examinations from Shanyin. It was said that Wang had traveled with a strange person since he was young and could pierce solid stones with his fingers. This time, he did not want to hurt people to cause trouble, so he only showed off his skills a little.</p>
<p>There was a boxing master named Jin in Zhuji who had hundreds of students and was a hero in one village. He claimed that he had never met an opponent in his life. One day, a boy came, only fifteen or sixteen years old, bowed and asked, "I heard that you are famous for your bravery and I would like to become your disciple." Jin said, "You are weak and I am afraid that it will not be easy for you to succeed." The boy laughed and said, "However, I have a small skill. Let me entertain my master with it." He lifted a bucket of water in front of the courtyard and poured it into the air, splashing the water more than ten feet. Then he filled the bucket with water again, and all the water went into the bucket without a drop missing. He then chopped down the flagpole in front of the door with a palm. Jin was greatly frightened when he saw this and said, "I did not expect the boy's divine skill to be ten times better than mine." He fled and never became a teacher again. Some say that the boy did not have much skill and only practiced these two things well, but it was also miraculous. It is a pity that the narrator forgot his name.</p>
<h3>Recent Events of Edison</h3>
<p>— Lvb冰</p>
<p>Almost everyone in the world knows that the greatest inventor is Edison. Last month, his son was in London, and people from all walks of life asked him about the inventor's recent situation. Newspapers and magazines have all recorded it, and I will summarize what I heard below.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Edison is already eighty-four years old, he still works for nine or ten hours every day. When he gets a new and different idea for an invention, he immediately starts experimenting. Even if his family urges him to eat, he turns his head and ignores them. He is in good health and high spirits. He often has at least five or six new ideas in his mind at the same time to solve the problem. He enjoys this kind of life very much.</p>
<p>The thing that Mr. Edison is most interested in now is experimenting to press rubber from the green leaves of plants. Up to now, he has analyzed more than 22,000 kinds of plants. Although he has not completely succeeded, he is still working hard and will eventually realize it one day. Other inventions, such as new-style motorcycles, automatic switches, train lights, electric heaters, electric pots, etc., have all been put into practical use in society. In short, the old man's thinking is old and more acute, and ideas flow from his mind, so his inventions are still endless.</p>
<h3>Talking about Baodu Mountain</h3>
<p>— Cheng Wuxi</p>
<p>Baodu Mountain is a dangerous mountain northwest of Yixian County, Shandong Province. It originally did not have a prominent name in history, but it became famous after Sun Meiyao's train robbery case in Lincheng. Now it is occupied by Sun Meisong as a bandit den. Why does Baodu Mountain have so much connection with bandits? My friend Mr. Wang, who does business in Yixian County, said that the scenery there is beautiful and it produces many exotic flowers and herbs, making it like a paradise. I have longed for it for a long time. On a boring rainy day, I will describe what he said and submit it to Free Talk to tell the world's mountain and water addicts.</p>
<p>Baodu Mountain was originally named Jun Mountain and is the source of the West Jia River. Legend has it that a hermit embraced a calf and escaped to the top to cultivate it, hence the current name. It is about nine li high and forty-five li in circumference. To the south, it leads Zhuo Mountain on the left and controls Yun Valley Mountain on the right, with doorways in between, and Baiyun Mountain as the welcoming screen. To the east, it guards the solidity of Shen Mountain, and to the west, it occupies the danger of E Mountain. The left wing, Lotus Mountain, has tall peaks arranged in a row for more than ten li, with pine and cypress trees shading the sky. The south side of the mountain is a flat area of six or seven li, and the right palm is covered with the vast Xing Mountain, with strange peaks and ridges crowned with clouds, competing with Lotus Mountain. Below it, the ground is covered with yellow grass, decorated with countless fruit trees. When thousands of flowers bloom at the same time, the five colors are all prepared, making it a spectacle. Below the northern ridge, there is a small path leading to Feixian County, and Zhuoyun Mountain has the same terrain: one man guards the pass, and ten thousand men cannot enter. The mountains surround each other and the waters meet, making it incomparably dangerous. It is indeed a guarantee for the southern border of Shandong Province. The mountains surrounding each other make the environment of Baodu Mountain dangerous, but its own danger is even greater than the environment. From the foot of the mountain to the top, the cliffs are thousands of feet high. In the northwest, the rocks are folded and the steps are chiseled to reach them, allowing only enough space for one foot. The top of the mountain is square and covers an area of dozens of miles, all of which is black soil and can be cultivated. It is covered with thatch. There is a very large stone pool, four or five feet deep, which does not dry up in a severe drought, and there is also a well more than ten feet deep, which is clear, green, sweet, and can be used for drinking. Wild grass extends over the cliffs, with purple stems and green leaves, and their names are not known. They have the effect of treating diseases. Below it, there are plants such as Calophyllum, Zelkova, and bitter lettuce. There are many unnamed small birds with red feathers that sing high in the treetops at dusk, resembling songs. Such a scenic spot has been occupied as a bandit den, making people regard it as a dangerous place. I cannot help but feel emotional about it.</p>
<h3>Continued Notes on Germophobia</h3>
<p>— Drunkenly Obsessed Student</p>
<p>There are three people I know who have germophobia and are full of quirks. Compared to the Shi and Yan you described, they are probably more extreme. I will list them below to make you laugh.</p>
<p>A friend of Mr. Cheng has a relative called Old Miss, who is old but still unmarried. People call her Old Miss. Old Miss is a germaphobe and always takes on the cleaning of her room herself. She does not like to use servants. She requires that everything in her room be clean and spotless. If a guest accidentally enters her room, regardless of gender, she will be sure to wipe the chairs and stools they sat on again and again. Not to mention washing the teacups they drank from. People know her quirks, so few people visit her. Old Miss once said that most men and women in the world are dirty, so she is determined not to marry and would rather remain a spinster.</p>
<p>There is a Mr. Lu in the South Market who is over sixty years old and also has germophobia. He pays special attention to his diet. He always declines banquets from relatives and friends. Although there are many restaurants in Shanghai, he rarely sets foot in them, fearing that the food is not clean. He says that only Western food is barely acceptable, but when he patronizes a Western restaurant, he must first ask where the kitchen is and personally visit it to see if its layout is suitable and clean. If it meets his requirements, he will stay; if not, he will turn his head and leave and go to another restaurant, even if it means traveling a long distance. Therefore, he knows which kitchens in the Western restaurants in the North Market are clean and hygienic and which are not. As for the kitchens of other miscellaneous restaurants, he says that they are not worth a look. He is too busy avoiding them, so how can he be happy? Such a meticulous eater is rare. Mr. Lu once said to me that he pays attention to hygiene everywhere, so he should be able to avoid diseases and enter the road to health, but he is still sick all his life, which is difficult to understand. I also smiled and replied.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Ren works in a certain government agency in the capital. A colleague of his is a bachelor and has quirks. He likes to wear new socks every day. He only wears socks once and throws them away if they are slightly dirty and never washes and changes them again. There is a basket in the corner of his room, and the socks he throws away are always piled up like a small hill. It is said that he pays his washing woman a lot of money. The annual cost is quite a lot, so people call him the "Sock King."</p>

<h3>A Trip Around the Yellow Sea (24)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>On April 22nd, I boarded a ship from Kobe to return to China. After stopping at Nagasaki for two hours, I left for home. At this time, only a few points remain in my mind.</p>
<p>(1) Japan is able to continue to develop Eastern old culture by using Western new culture. Therefore, on one hand, they show a very large amount of absorption, and on the other hand, they show a very strong conservatism.</p>
<p>(2) Japan's current position is also very dangerous. The situation of confrontation between the two major financial groups has long been formed, and they are each showing their magical powers to use the two major political parties they created with financial resources as a bitter struggle on the political stage. When they encounter common interests, such as dealing with the Communist Party and the Proletarian Party, they temporarily unite. As a result, the confrontation between labor and capital is becoming increasingly fierce. Their national absorption is great, and education is relatively popular, so their so-called ideological problems cannot be solved by high pressure or small patching methods. Their population is increasing at a very high rate. Since the problem of recession occurred, it has further promoted changes in their thinking. As for foreign countries, everyone is paying attention to the impact on Eastern commerce and economy after the completion of the Soviet Union's five-year industrial plan and wants to solve it ahead of time. The problem of irresistible earthquakes occurs on a small scale every few years and on a large scale every few decades. In other nations, this may inevitably lead to ideological sadness and decadence, but they turn it into a motivation for advancement. However, it is also said that the outlook on life of some people has changed as a result. These are all current situations and problems to be solved in their country.</p>
<p>(3) Because of the above, a conclusion is naturally formed into a national consensus: outward development. The ambitions of warlords and capitalists go without saying. Politicians believe that the only way to reduce the entanglement of labor-capital class problems is to use national thought to break through it horizontally. As for the population problem, the economic problem, and even the natural disaster problem, it is nothing more than that Changsha is too small to maneuver. The only way to solve the problem is to develop outward, outward development. Who else is there to develop towards besides us, China? What about the past advocacy of the Japanese-American war, and the current advocacy of the Japanese-Soviet war? Why do they have hatred for the United States and hatred for the Soviet Union? The competition is for us, China. However, their goals are even broader than before. In the past, it was for Manchuria and Mongolia. Now, the entire area north of the Yellow River is within their reach.</p>
<p>Now that we know Japan's present and future, let's discuss our own.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Storytelling</p>
<h3>Casual Lake Talks (5)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>The title of "Tangguan" (Hall Official) began in the Song Dynasty. During the Chunxi period, Emperor Shouhuang used the world to support the three halls of Deshou. When he traveled to the lakes and mountains, the food from the imperial kitchen was all delivered by the Hall Officials of the Ministry of Rites. Therefore, those who delivered cups and dishes in front of the imperial banquet were all Hall Officials. If someone mistakenly thought they were waiters, the store owner would quickly stop them and say, "No, they are Hall Officials." Therefore, it has become a common practice to this day. No one does not respect the waiters as Hall Officials. The caskets and mats used by the people of Hangzhou for sweeping graves were also made according to palace regulations for carrying wine when traveling. There is also this item in Dream of the Red Chamber. Its shape is like an examination basket, made of wood, slightly like a sacrificial vessel. Every four drawers are stacked together to form a hip flask. Each drawer is divided into six compartments, which can hold twenty-four dishes. Next to it are placed wine vessels, chopsticks, and mats. When drinking on the ground, the mats are spread out. They are about two feet square and can be folded in half. There is leather lining on the outside, and two ears can be lifted. During the Qing Dynasty, the incense sedan chairs of the government officials were all hung with mats, and the senior officials had boxes carried by two men behind the sedan chair. Some say it is a crime clothes box to serve the emperor. Once he is angered, he will be stripped of his position, so he must prepare crime clothes. All ranks below his current rank are prepared, so the great officials of the first and second ranks have more than nine pieces of clothing prepared.</p>
<p>West Lake water shield, some say it comes from Xiaoshan Xiang Lake, but it is not known that the water shield of Xiang Lake actually came from West Lake. The Qiantang County Records of the Wanli period say that the water shield grows in West Lake and is harvested in late spring and early summer. There are ice bells attached under the leaves. It used to be said that it was produced in Xiang Lake, but it is not known that the people of Xiang Lake came here to take it. The first shoots are tender and have no leaves, called Pheasant Tail Water Shield, also known as Horseshoe Water Shield. When the leaves are stretched out, they are called Silk Water Shield. In autumn, no one picks them. Li Liufang's Water Shield Soup Song says that West Lake water shield is sold in Xiaoshan for thousands of burdens, and Xiang Lake is full of them. He also made West Lake Lying Tour Album. In the postscript of picking water shield at Three Pools, he praised the beauty of the water shield, but he did not know that there is no water shield in Xiang Lake, and all of them are picked from West Lake. It is also said that the water shield is not good if it is not soaked in Xiang Lake water. It is not known that the water shield must be soaked overnight when it is first picked to make it more fertile. All spring water and lake water are acceptable and do not have to be Xiang Lake. The boat in the picture is full of water shield sellers from Xiaoshan. There are many poems about water shield, but the most appropriate one is Zhang Suichen's use of the three words "smooth flow spoon", which is indeed only suitable for water shield soup. Those who do not know the cooking method usually only leave the leaves and no longer have the so-called ice bells. Ice bells are the shape of the starch in the stem, which naturally condenses and is attached to the leaves, transparent like dewdrops, smooth and non-sticky. But if you wash it with cold water, it will still exist. If you boil it, it will dissolve and disappear without any meaning, equal to pea seedlings.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Prices Fall Rapidly</h3>
<p>Sharp drop of eleven taels nine mace</p>
<p>Breaks through the 800-tael mark: Yesterday, the gold market suddenly saw a sharp drop and broke through the 800-tael mark. The wind and waves were urgent and people were panicked. In the end, it plummeted by twelve taels. In the morning, it was still stable, fluctuating by only two or three taels. But when silver market slightly fell, and the exchange rate remained unchanged, rumors spread that the international silver market would hold a meeting or have a bailout plan. Upon hearing this, large households such as Mr. Lu and other bulls desperately sold off. As the exchange rate became looser, it led to a rapid drop like a waterfall, falling ten taels. Finally, it fell to 792 taels. The silver market was expected to rebound, but due to the Saturday market closure, it was investigated that the market had been fluctuating this week. The highest price was 814 taels and the lowest price was 791.6 taels, a difference of 22.4 taels. The total drop was fifteen taels. The ups and downs of the market were difficult to grasp. In short, it was said that it was forced by the environment.</p>
<p>Presents a linear downward trend: At the opening of the July market this morning, it was slightly lower by seven mace at 803.7 taels. Large contracts only fell by 1/16 in the near term. There was no increase or decrease in the long-term and silver prices. The private telegrams were the same. When Yuan Mao, Yongyi, Fengyong, etc. bought in, it increased to 0.04 taels. As Yuanheng, Yongfeng, etc. sold, and British gold also showed a loosening trend, banks exchanged 1.875 to 2.25. The price was then reduced to 800.008 taels. The order was issued not to change the time to 0.0167 taels. Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanmao, etc. then advanced to 0.03 taels and then retreated to 1.4 mace. Fuchang, Chunyuan, and Yong bought in, adding slightly over one tael. At 10:20, it was 0.025 taels. Afterwards, a soft phase was seen, only suppressing a small two taels, but there was no special change. Until around 11 o'clock, the storm suddenly rose. It was suddenly heard that a silver price meeting had been called, so the general bulls took this opportunity to sell off. Daxingyong, Yuanxingyong, Yongfeng, Xinhang, Senchangyong, Hengxingyuan, etc. were all elated. The sellers also saw a weakening trend in foreign exchange.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Turns Downward</h3>
<p>The yarn market weakened. Sales of spot yarn were still good. The Guangdong merchants actively purchased, so 16-count and 20-count yarns sold well. Japan also bought 200 bales of 16-count Ren Zhong yarn at a price of 166 taels without tax. However, the business of 10-count coarse yarn was sluggish. There were about 20,000 bales of yarn in the yarn warehouse, so the sellers were bold. Although there were 20,000 to 30,000 bales of sales in the north, the cloth market failed to be stimulated due to the lack of sales of coarse yarn. Furthermore, there was a rumor that a major merchant would sell the standard yarn for this month at 63 taels. If it falls to around 60 taels, they will purchase it. Therefore, market sentiment softened, and the sellers' pressure increased. The overseas yarn situation was still flat. The market atmosphere fell further in the afternoon due to the decline in gold prices. However, the bottom stock of fine yarn was reduced, and export transactions have been continuous recently.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Falls by One Tael. Due to the decline in foreign cotton prices, the market sentiment was weak in the morning. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and prices fell by 0.03-0.08. In the afternoon, the market situation worsened as the gold price closed lower, and prices fell by another 0.04-0.08 for each month. The transaction volume was 28,150 bales. The sellers were Gongtai (1,200 bales), Gu Da (1,000 bales), Changfeng (800 bales), and Yichang (700 bales). The buyers were Yiyu (2,500 bales), Yicheng (900 bales), Shenxin (900 bales), Gengfeng (900 bales), and Dafu (700 bales). The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market: Small Investors Selling Short</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending downward due to the decline in American cotton prices, the weak yarn market, and the lack of actual sales. Market sentiment has softened.

<p>Hankou Standard Falls by 0.03. The morning opening price for Hankou standard cotton fell by 0.02-0.03 due to unfavorable foreign cotton prices.

<h3>US Cotton Frequently Reaches New Lows Last Week</h3>
<p>Private Estimates of Cotton Fields Reduced by About 10.1%</p>
<p>New York, May 5th Report on the Cotton Market Conditions of the Past Week: The Cotton Market in the past week was hindered by the changes in the securities market. At the beginning of the week, it hit a new low for the season, mainly due to long liquidation by brokers on Wall Street and in Europe. However, the securities market quickly rebounded, and banks and brokers also reduced the required margin, while the purchase of government bonds exceeded expectations. All of this helped to restore confidence. The weather was generally good, but some areas still needed rain. According to five private estimates, cotton fields were reduced by about 10.1%. Spot demand in the South showed a slight increase, and foreign yarn mills had more confidence in the current market prices, so there were increasing rumors of increased exports. The cotton market was quiet, and buyers were skeptical. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Grain Rice Market in River Below Indeed Rebounds</p>
<p>The source of the New Gate yesterday Road is gradually [unclear], because the shipping merchants have suffered huge losses after the continuous sharp decline in this port, so they are watching the market. Initially, the producing market also went downstream with the situation in the Shanghai market, but due to the firm inquiries from the customers, the number of rice ships transporting to Shanghai decreased. However, at the beginning of the morning opening, the local store transactions were quite active. The market for Changxi top japonica rice turned active, and the price increased by 0.1 yuan. Ordinary rice must rise by as much as 0.2 yuan. The early and late indica rice market was slightly tight. Yangjian followed the japonica rice and rose by 0.1 yuan. Dujian rose by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Local tip goods were scarce and stable. Glutinous rice was selling well and the price did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Fengji Wharf Rice Market in South Shanghai had twelve or thirteen numbers of active destinations. The Baoqi of Changxi Beigeng was very high, and the quantity and price showed a downward trend. Then, when the North Market turned higher, it turned lively, but the market already had a price difference of 0.1-0.2 feet. Also, the retail prices of Jiangsu, Tong, and North [unclear] were low [unclear]. There is still hope for promotion. The South customers, such as Jiao, Li, Sijing, and Lianyong, etc. are significantly reduced in batches, and the trend is to increase by 0.1 foot. The local sales of Yangdujian and Yangjian continued, and the market was stable. The Tongbian and Yinhua were selling well, and the amount of goods arriving was gradually decreasing. The big market also felt strong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer [unclear] market was quite active, because there were fewer Dumi rice arrivals from the river below, and sales were active and prices also rose. The street also paid attention to the customers [unclear], so the transaction saw a boom. Although the price did not rise, the trend was already very good. The whole day's transaction was 1,500 bags, the price was 11.3 to 11.1 yuan. Jiangxi machine rice 500 bags at a price of 12.8 to 12.4 yuan were for the Tianjin merchants to handle.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour Finally Shows Advantage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month was because the foreign wheat quotation rose by 0.3-0.6 yuan, so at the beginning of the opening, the sentiment was quite excited, and the price increased by 0.01 from the closing price of the previous day. However, after the second round, the increase was heavy and fell back to nearly 0.01. Until the opening in the afternoon, it was also flat and not much different from the morning. After that, due to the change in the weather, there was a rain image, and the inland merchant's minds suddenly became shrewd. (It is heard that a big factory also bought in.) The opening price of each month saw a step up again. According to the recent situation, it is feared that the observations of the north and south will be opposite. It is estimated that more than 90% of the new participants in the north are new, and only about 70% in Jiangnan, so the final rise and fall depends on the actual sales. As a result, the this month rose by 0.01 compared to the previous day. The prices for July and August rose by 0.015. The prices for September rose by 0.0125. The prices for October rose by 0.0075. The prices for November rose by 0.0025.</p>
<h3>Great Progress Seen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the [unclear] market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month was strong again. The quotation for foreign wheat rose by 0.3-0.6 yuan. The market sentiment was inevitably brought up. It is heard that the long positions for this month are mostly held by local residents. They naturally easily improve the opportunity when they encounter it. The long and short positions are all [unclear] speculative during the green and yellow season. The sentiment for each month is inevitably weak due to the good harvest in Jiangbei. If the goods arrive excessively and raise the price excessively, they can be flooded. As a result, this month rose by 0.03 compared to the previous day. July rose by 0.02. August to November each increased by 0.01. New wheat samples are gradually appearing. The color of the wheat is still good. For example, the new wheat from Penglong Town arrived yesterday with 250 bags at a price of 3.85 yuan. This is the first batch of boat wheat. If there is no heavy rain, each road can arrive smoothly. Also, 270 bags of Nanjing wheat opened at 3.9 yuan.</p>
<p>The Sugar Market is Throwing Goods, and Dutch Red Sugar is Opening Vigorously</p>
<p>The Clearing Market Unanimously Fell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area reported that the Cuban spot sugar price had recovered by 0.0625 compared to the previous electricity report. The New York futures sugar for September rose by 0.04, and the extra month also rose by 0.05. The Java spot sugar remained unchanged. The foreign exchange in the public market clearing market turned long, the demand was not smooth, and the popularity was weaker. The price of No. 24 Dutch sugar coarse sand white sugar was from 11.4125 to 11.4 yuan out of the household, and the market was still strong and weak. The price of No. 20 medium second white was 10.09 yuan, and there were few buyers. The transaction of Japanese sugar was even more sporadic. The asking price for Z Mark was 11.35 yuan, SH Mark was 11.1 yuan, Mark was 11.75 yuan, YT Mark was 11.3 yuan, and YRO Mark was 11.095 yuan for Meiji goods. The trend was very [unclear]. There are [unclear] goods of Dutch sugar, and [unclear] foreign firms sell 100 tons of No. 8 Dutch red sugar shipped in June and July at a price of 5.075 Dutch guilders [unclear]. Like Liji, Dachang, and Qiuxin factories, the price of [unclear] new goods of Dutch red sugar shipped in August and September fluctuated slightly, from a high of 5.1-5.075 to a low of 5.05, but the market's intention to enter was not strong, so the exact number could not be sold. Only a few saw a slight transaction.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Wuxi Xinxinzhou Releases Prices and Competes to Collect Superior Cocoons</p>
<p>Improved Variety High-Quality Goods Have Opened at 62-3 Yuan</p>
<p>In Wuxi, more than a hundred cocoon firms in various markets and villages uniformly opened the scale yesterday. This year, the cocoon production in Xiyi was surprisingly poor. Only the late [unclear] cocoons had a slightly better harvest, but the total was less than one-third of the previous year. The arrival of goods in the market was not prosperous. Although various cocoon merchants had a proposal to limit the cocoon price, the number of receipts was so small that farmers insisted on selling high-quality cocoons at high prices, and they had to release prices and compete for collection. In the cocoons firms such as Baochang in Qianzhou, Beixinqiao, Shichuang, and Beiqifang, the price for competing to collect improved high-quality cocoons has been raised to 62-3 yuan. The price of high-quality goods in other markets and villages has also risen to 56-7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Red and Green Tea Transactions are Both Rare</h3>
<p>Yesterday, for black tea from Qining and other roads, the English merchants in Yingde had no major purchase appetite. The total transaction was only more than 500 boxes. The sales trend depreciated daily. There was no major progress in the Zhenmei market. More than 1,000 boxes of goods from Tunxi and Suian and other roads arrived yesterday. Few new dishes were opened. Although there were sporadic transactions in Tuzhuang Wenzhou goods, the selling price was lower than before by 0.02-0.03, and the overall trend was still a high degree of control.</p>
<p>Hardware: 150 Tons of Pig Lead Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>The market for pig lead is very excellent due to the lack of goods. The standard is as high as 16.25 yuan per dan, up 0.025 compared to before. It is found that the buyers are mostly merchants from the Yangtze River, Tianjin, Shaoxing, and Ningbo, and the decorations in this street are also quite good. Unfortunately, since the market was collected, it feels like a drop in the bucket, resulting in an unusually beautiful market. Yesterday, 150 tons of spot goods were suddenly loaded at the Gonghexang Wharf, so the market was able to avoid the panic of no shortage of goods.</p>

<h3>German Pocket Battleship Surprises Major Naval Powers</h3>
<p>Mechanical Materials All Use Light Metals to Save 1,700 Tons of Ship Weight——Breaking the Eastern Restraint of the Versailles Treaty——</p>
<p>Berlin News: The Washington Conference stipulates that the tonnage of battleships is limited to a maximum of 35,000 tons, and the Versailles Treaty further stipulates that Germany may not manufacture battleships of more than 11,000 tons. Under this restriction, the German Navy Department has spent many years researching and testing a new 10,000-ton pocket battleship. Its clever shipbuilding technology has alarmed the major powers. The machinery installed in the ship is made of light metal, which can save 1,700 tons of ship weight. There are unexpected installations in the armament and armor. There are six 16-inch cannons and eight 5-inch cannons. The new cannons of the aircraft have four turrets for launching torpedoes. Its combat power is unmatched among the battleships of major powers. The manufacturing cost is 40 million marks, and the endurance of the town's voyage is the most durable. It only needs to replenish fuel once from Germany to China.</p>
