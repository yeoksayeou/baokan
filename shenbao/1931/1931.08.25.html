<p>此次我國水災。世界列國頗多致其同情之忱。英美等國都紛紛來電慰問。最近日竽且撥日金十萬元。作我賑災善後中之有力之資助。凡此救災恤鄰之摯誼。與胞與天下最高尙之同情心。吾人於拜手領受之餘。都謹以十二分之誠意。敬致謝忱。而日本與我國隔僅一水。關係培切。在比來兩國交涉緊急之際。吾人對於日皇助賑之盛意。除感謝外。尤覺有未能已於言者在。</p>
<p>中日兩國。同處東亞。以言利害。則唇齒相依。以言種族。則誼若兄弟。嚮使中日兩國。能眞本平等親善助人自助之旨。携手而共存共榮之途。謀東亞永久之和平者。蓋意中事。然而徵之近數十年來中日交涉之史實。皆爲我國家我民族恥辱重重鞭痕疊血跡斑之寫眞。誰實爲之。孰令致之。中國國民詎能一日忘。詎忍一日忘。近年來中日邦。交更呈惡化現象。日人之所得者爲何。至足發人深思。欲謀兩國之眞正福利。端在於兩國之眞誠合作。而眞誠合作。則重於事實上之眞誠表現。絕不在於親善和平高調之自彈自唱。亦不在於小利小惠之慈悲施予。我僑韓同胞死亡之血跡猶未乾也。傷殘猶未起也。財產則皆蕩然無存也。最近靑島日人。亦復有聚衆尋礜之事件發生。日人一面爲我造禍。一面又對我助賑。福乎禍乎。誠令人懷疑而莫釋。</p>
<p>如日人眞同情於我。眞爲我造福。則應着目於其遠者大者。遠者大者爲何。即自動放棄中日問一切不平等條約。根本改變其對華政策。不平等條約。爲束縛我國家我民族自由之桎梏。亦即我國民痛心疾首一日未能或忘者。假如日人能毅然决然。聲言放棄。爲世界各國。倡乃爲眞造福於我國家。眞造福於我國。民進而言之。亦即所以造福於東亞以至世界。故日皇同情於我國之水。災固至足感。但吾人更深盼日皇能擴大其同情心。實行解除束縛我國家我民族自由之桎梏。此舉如能實現。日人乃眞能傲昭告於世人曰。「此天下之義舉也。如懷疑於此者。非正義之罪人而何耶。」</p>
<p>迴憶一九二三年九月一日日本大地震。彼時北京政府九月三日即召集特别閣議。設立日災協濟會。撥欵二十萬元助賑。（旅日華僑另撥賑十萬元）并弛米糧出口之禁。廣東方面設立日災救濟會。以伍朝樞廖仲愷爲正副會長。上海方面設立中國協濟日災義賑會。助賑品十二萬元。并派新銘輪運米助賑。天津方。　設立救災同志會。東北方面。亦助賑品五十萬元。張雨亭自捐十萬元。其他职段祺瑞個人捐助十萬元。曹錕四萬元。徐世昌曹汝霖等諸人各捐若干元。全國各地踴躍捐輸。一種熱烈情狀。至今猶歷歷在吾人記憶之。中當時日災爲驟時之突。變故人皆覺其嚴。重此次我國水。災來勢較緩。故人亦稍稍忽視。實則我今日之水災。較之日本當年之地震。其嚴重或且過之。决無不及也。吾人言此。絕非與日人算舊賬。但當時有一事深印入吾人腦際而不能忘者。即爲我國人一面竭力以謀收回满期之旅大。一面仍急人之急。熱烈救助。絕不以日人强横抗不交還旅大之故。而减少其救助日災之熱忱。此種態度。吾人自認足以表示中華民族和平博愛之精神。而歷年來日人之待我則何如者。我負日人。抑日人負我。往事未遠。日人其一深思。</p>

<p>皆大歡喜、邱飛海江道章、不負所命、全勝坎拿大二單打、中華隊遂得扶輪杯萬國網球决賽權、坎拿大先以二比一佔先、今乃以二比三爲中華淘汰、江道章勝里特不難、而邱飛海之勝得孚、則風雨飄颻險象環生、七百餘人、無不頻心息氣以觀、邱飛海苦戰五盤方勝、可謂幸矣、今定二十八日起與日本决賽、</p>
<h3 id="c93">江道章勝里特 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>

<p>丨坎拿大先敗丨</p>
<p>江道章（中）（六比四）（六比二）（六比三）里特（坎）</p>
<p>江道章直落三勝里特、中華隊先奪回一分、挽成平手、里特昨日遠非江之敵手、觀者見江之節節勝利、無不喜慰萬分、</p>
<p>一帆風順里特開球、江道章一帆風順連得四局、里特奪回三局、江以六比四勝第一盤、第二盤開戰、江道章仍用極有力之捕擊、向角邊打去、里特雖爲攔網好手、至此不能近網、四比一後、江又以六比二勝第二盤、江旣得二盤、勝勢已定、里特再開球、得一局、江又連得三局以三比二勝以六比三造成直落三、</p>

<p>（六比四）</p>
<p>江道章旣勝里特、中華坎拿大兩國命運、全在邱飛海德孚之誰勝誰負、江里戰畢、時邱以二比一佔德孚先、轉瞬德孚亦奪回一盤、成二比二、最後一盤、生死關頭、邱將軍用命、果然六比四勝利、中華隊遂得决賽權、</p>
<p>風雲變色邱德開賽北風狂吹、陰　四合、邱飛海開球、一下竟連失四局、德孚每局無不上網攔殺、當關守住、邱見勢以爲抽球必爲其殺、遂以高球欲越過之、於是近抽則觸網、高球則出界、竟一愁莫展、四比一五比二、而以二比六大敗、觀者覩此情狀、無不相顧失色、即風雲亦變、满塲細雨斜風、</p>
<p>突然轉機第二盤開球邱飛海又失二局、邱正仰天自嘆球運欠佳、而風停雨止、從此轉機、邱見高球之失敗、知仍以猛抽爲上、於是不顧德孚守網、對角猛抽、球低而急、德舉拍回答、觸網累累、用力開出界、此路一開、邱飛海路政皆通、接連得勝九局、第二盤則連勝六局、六比二回示德孚以顏色、</p>
<p>人心大定第三盤開始邱又連勝三局、故共計九局、邱雖猛烈、機會一來、輕輕一斬、球適落網前而不彈起、時近時遠、神乎具技、德孚挽回二比三之數、邱五比二、六比三、結局再勝第三盤、合計二比一佔先、人心大定、</p>
<p>把握又失满望邱再勝一盤、則勝局即定、豈知德孚開球、邱竟連失三局、勉拾一局、德孚五比一又佔極優勢、六比三勝第四盤、邱得勝把握、又在此失去、此盤一失、則二比二、邱體力羣知其弱、大爲擔心其第五盤之勝利、</p>
<p>安心歸去成敗勝負、全在此最後一盤矣、人人面面相觀、大擔心事、德孚發球邱得之、德亦勝一局、繼邱連得二局三比一佔極優勢、已有六分把握、放心一半、五比三時、德孚發球、德孚忽左右進殺、奪回成五比四、心事又來、如成五五、從此多事矣、福至運通、邱以六比四得勝驚喜交集、二小時心事方了、安心歸矣、</p>

<p>海關鳴砲警告江海輪船停開</p>
<p>近一星期來、本埠火傘高張·酷熱不退寒暑表常在九十六七之間、迨乎前日風勢恬靜、秋陽益覺可畏、乃晨風力加勁濃雲追逐、氣候頓見凉爽、蓋太平洋上颶風已進至東海、向江浙海濱吹來、據昨晨十一時、徐家匯天文台警告、其時颶風業過那覇、距滬僅六百公里、向西北方及西北西方進發、迫近上海至溫州間海濱、預料在今晨以前、可以豋陸、但據下午四時三十分天文台預報、風向已専趨西北西方、迫及溫州台州海岸、恐將仍循上次路線、吹過甌江流域、或可不致過滬云、及昨晚九時又發出特别警告、極大颶風現正緩緩吹過東海、即因中國北部及日本方面、發生壓力、遂折向西北西方面而去、東海及吳淞口以至台灣沿海岸一帶波濤洶惡、且有旋風、</p>
<p>海關通知航界昨日下午一時半、本埠江海關即在愛多亞路口、高懸大風信號與報警黑球、並即通知各輪公司、着在滬各海輪之未出口者、暫且停開、以便留泊浦江避風、免遭意外、四時半、浦東旗台、又懸掛黑色風球、同時鳴砲一響以資警告、</p>
<p>近海輪船停航今回大風與上次地點方向相若、故昨日太古寗紹兩公司滬甬班輪、如新北京等、奉到海關警告後、即宣布停開、其已上輪旅客紛紛退票回去、改於明日出口從寗波開來新江天寗興各輪、昨亦電告在甬避風、暫不開來、而滬台班溫州海門班等各近海線各輪、昨午亦一致停航、留滬避風、</p>
<p>南華航輪延班本埠各輪公司、懲於上次遇風之危險、故今次格外愼重、太古南華班輪綏陽號·日清蘆山丸等、均各延遲出口時刻、須俟今晨風息後再開、又長江各輪、亦展遲離滬時刻、如果今晨風勢不退决計不開、</p>
<p>浦江小船避風昨日午後起</p>
<p>黃浦江潮浪驟漲、在江面小駁船及舢板划子、均已停止裝駁貨件與渡江載客、在傍晚小火輪亦不行、民船則相率駛入蘇州河内避風、</p>
<p>上次颶風海難第一次颶風共有四艘失事、怡和洋行先有威升觸礁溺死一人、餘均遇救來滬、繼則廣生輪被風浪打沉、乘客職工完全落海、僅有三人獲救被難員客家屬、連日紛到該行探詢眞相、及至昨日、始得福州消息、言廣生輪遇大風後船身觸礁、在兩小時内全輪下沉、在船之旅客船員水手、竟無一得免悉行落海中有生火一人水手一人、廚房飯頭一人、得於入海後浮起海面、經三十六小時、爲漁舟所救、後附乘木船而至福州、本月二十四日由福州怡和洋行及英領事、將該三人送上三北公司萬象輪、遣歸來滬預計星期四可到關於廣生輪之失事眞相、與全船死亡之數額、（至少當在一百數十名）在該三人到滬後、當可明瞭一切矣</p>

<p>救濟會討論美麥問題</p>
<p>全國水災救濟委員會財政組、昨日開會討論美國農務局、對於賒售小麥履電、據聞、關於還欵期及利息兩項、尙須再行商請該局、予以更優惠之條件云、</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>看不見的眼鏡</p>
<p>凡是兩眼患近視或遠光的人。不得不在鼻子上架一個眼鏡。以助目力。然而一般愛時髦的男女。總以爲眼眼鏡不是一件時髦的飾物。往往不願戴。右是那近視和遠光的程度。未免因此而增進了。如今英國方面。新發明了一種看不見的眼鏡。可以解决這個難問題。發明者是某大眼鏡公司的職員。他製成一種極小的鏡。片略如碟子的模樣。緊嵌在上下眼皮之。間罩住眼球。使人們在數尺以外。一些看不出他戴着眼。鏡因爲那鏡片薄得異。常竟如無物一般。</p>
<p>這種眼鏡。於優伶們最爲合。用有平日本患近視而戴着眼鏡的。偏偏他所扮演的劇中人物。萬不能戴上一個眼鏡。任是他善於表演。也不得不另請高明。自這種看不見的眼鏡一出。就甚麽人物都可扮演。毫無困難了。</p>

<p>近因患痔。行止坐。臥俱感痛苦故已久不赴社。昨於病榻中。讀報得見倉儲募捐名單。内有陳翊園一名。不審另有其人。抑爲栩字之誤。竊有一得之見。貢獻當局。以冀釆納。嘗思倉儲之制。第一要件。當爲推陳出新。取有餘而補不足。則人人樂願不致觀望。最好定一辦法。每捐倉儲基金十元者。得於對月取米一担。即按其時米價。找足以若干元爲最高限度。聽跌不聽漲。凡儲半年或一年者。按月照市遞減五分。給與儲單。按照預定月期出米。送力另計。例如儲米一年。繳入一百廿元。分十二個月出清。則第二月者減一角。第十二月者得減六角。如是則人人樂得有便宜之保障。工商廠號。以及學校團體。大小住戶。莫不踴躍投資。以防米貴之影響。假如百口之家。儲備十六擔一月之米。即得收集一百六十元之基金。上海人口以三百萬。計儲米一月。約十六萬擔。糴入之價。作十三元論。約二百萬元。而在開始募集儲米之時。即得陸續收入現金一百六十萬元。存庫生息。各按對月付米。即每日糴入六萬擔。不過八十萬元。糶出五萬擔。作收補價三元論。即得每日補收現金十五萬元。實際上之墊欵但有廿萬元足矣。並且此廿萬元。亦非必要。蓋出納周轉。尤必有其餘裕。凡人心理。莫不惴惴於來日之大難。决不致但顧目前。故儲一年半年者必多。假如平均儲四個月論。即得收集儲金六百四十萬元。而信用所孚。即集千萬要非難事。若取此策。則自隗始。即儲半年。數亦近千。更爲勸募。似覺較易。否則募人一捐。即不啻收受一注人情禮物。而禮尙往來。責報無盡。近十年來。感此困苦。實已視同債務。比債更凶。竊料别人亦必如是。故就一得这見。獻因勢利導之策如上。幸釆納之。（却酬）</p>

<p>十二日晨。晤西開布司。C·H·BOSE乃一商人余曾主其家者。彼告我以大仙修道處。乃在尼泊爾西北高山森林中。從德利上去。彼亦將往彼處。棄人間世矣其林中多仙人住處。食果飲水。練習坐功。若大仙者。雖住在雪中。亦不寒也。布司爲富商。無妻子。告我許多道。語余問以若遇虎蛇將如何。曰我曾遇虎二次。一次遇大蛇。只有默念神。彼若食我。我省却許多煩惱。保持此臭皮囊。彼若捨我。亦聽之而已。無所畏也。余念布司黨同居不覺其奇。今乃爲此言。乃印度人之普通觀念。甘地視英人之槍彈。正與彼同其觀念耳。布司示我以地圖。云尼泊爾之東有一小獨立國。不屬英與中華。在不丹之西。尼泊爾之東。西藏之南高山之上地名喜開。</p>
<p>其中修道學佛者甚多彼有兩地可去。一在尼泊爾國外西北之地即大仙所居。爲恒河發源處。一爲尼泊爾東。大吉嶺之地。喜開地方也。余聞英人不許人入藏非得英人許可不能過去者。故調查非易易也。余念喜馬拉雅爲世界第一高山。印度文化發源此地印度敎爲佛敎之母。而印度敎源於此山及恒。河佛受印度敎之感化。故亦入雪山修道藉恒河說法。願我國佛徒結伴來遊。雪山近西藏。以領略其風味布司欲約我一月之夫參訪高山仙人。余病未能。要之喜馬拉雅山中怪事不少。吾願吾國人一探之也。有日本人某氏曾留印十餘年。着有西藏遊記。帶一僕爲華人。其僕之妻爲西藏人。印人至今屢稱之。吾華不少資本。家或孜孜於錢數之增。加或忙於晝夜賭博。喜馬賽山之秘密。一任日本人之探檢。華人不知也。道階師銳志願往。困於經濟而中止殊爲可惜。</p>
<h3 id="c163">東北考察隨筆（一） <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 劉穗九</p>
<p>（一）東北與滿蒙</p>
<p>余旅居東北已一年餘。此一年中除講學東北大學外。又時時旅行各地。考察訪問。採集關於東北各種研究資料固多。而見聞所及。尤不可勝數。</p>
<p>閒嘗研究「東北」二字。用以代替「满蒙。」殊覺欠妥。因「東北」爲方向之不定名稱。而「满蒙」乃地理之確定名詞。吾人試貿然言曰「東北」。則聞之者不知何所指。尤以對國外人言爲甚若對任何人言及「满蒙」。則未有不立刻了解所指爲中國之東三省與内外蒙古者。故日本人選用「满蒙」而不用「東北」二字。殆有不得不爾之勢乎。國人有謂此乃日人含有劃分東北之意。實則日人或歐美人若稱「東北」。則顯然指其本國之東北。或指其所欲指之特種東北。而非中國版圖内之東北矣故予用「中國東北部」一辭爲。題庶乎易於明瞭且可適用爲國際通名也。</p>
<p>吾人今日所謂之東北部。固曾爲满族與蒙族之根據地。無可諱言。满蒙則原爲漢族領有之建州。蒙地亦曾受漢族播化之惠。其先史時代是否仍屬漢族領有。乃考古學上問題矣。</p>
<p>（二）東北大學槪况</p>
<p>余於中國東北部問題。旣多年感有興味。乃於去歲署假離武漢大學後。即至大連瀋陽一帶游歷旋受東北大學之聘。於研究中國東北部問題愈得便利矣。</p>
<p>東北大學。乃民國十一年間。奉天敎育廳長謝蔭昌君（江蘇人）之訏謨擘畫奔走運籌。頗費苦心。當時計畫成而欵無着。後商之省長王永江氏。並敦請其兼任校長。王君詢以需欵若干。謝君乃提出二百萬之預算。王君笑頷曰。以二百萬元之運籌。易一大學校長。爲東北敎育計。变願任勞。事乃告成。而謝君因倡議奔走勞瘁過度。且辭去廳長。避地哈爾濱養病矣。自後王永江氏乃聯合吉黑兩省共同出資。就原有瀋陽高等師範學校改辦大學理工科。就公立文學専門學校改辦文法科。並函准清室。施助昭陵前白椿以外陵地爲校址劃撥陵前官地四百餘畝。建築東北大學工廠。資本金總額二百八十萬元。總計大學全部共佔地一千五百八十餘畝。文學法學兩院及學生宿舍大樓約共百萬元。又有理工學院大樓。理工學生宿舍大樓各一所。敎育學院大樓及同院學生宿舍大樓各一所。校長辦公樓一所。各費數十萬元。</p>

<p>— 子美</p>
<p>王壯飛著…上海勤奮書局出版</p>
<p>吾國體育出版物的寥落、恰似體育事業幼稚的寫照、也即是體育事業幼稚的原因、在這寥落的體育出版物中尤其是關於社會體育的著述、我們幾未之一見社會體育的似進非進、亦無怪其然</p>
<p>最近了一個空谷足音、上海馬浪路新民邨卅九號勤奮書局有「體育場指南」一書出版、披讀一過、議論固多精遂之處、方法又皆切合實用、洵屬草創的善本、予吾國社會體育以不少的貢獻、</p>
<p>體育塲指南著者王壯飛、辦理上海公共體育塲有十多年的經歷、硜硜孜孜地實做從不發作什麽言論、因此我們只知道他是個行者、不是個方論者、其實言行互相表裏、能做的未有不能說、的王君昔日之默不一言、或者研究尙未達到某種階段、不願輕易發表罷了、</p>
<p>著者在牟言中、論吾國公共體育塲成績不良原因、扼定二點、（一）各體育着經費過少、（二）民衆多無業餘時、間可謂一針見血、他歸結的說、「要彌補這兩個缺點、須使多數人士、惕然於社會體育衰落的可危、同努力建設的願望、非惟敎育行政當局這樣、本書第一第二章中、反復注意於社會體育的效能、公共體育塲的需要、無非爲此、」</p>
<p>他對於社會體育的實施、也有幾句很眞摯的話、「我自信辦理公共體育塲、本無因定的方法、能忠於其事、力謀運動人數的增進、體育功效的完成、怎樣去實現理想、怎樣去銷除障、碍時時留心、刻刻注意、一切很合實用的方法、自會源源而來、狃於成法是不行的、」所以他的實施方法、完全據經騐所得、作忠實之報告、自第三章至第八章歷歷言之、不誇不秘槪其内容、</p>
<p>（一）理論方面、熱烈地喚起多數人士努力於社會體育的建設、——第一章第二章、</p>
<p>（二）方法方面、忠實地報告辦理體育塲十多年的經騐、供大家的參考、——第三章至第八章、</p>
<p>第一章爲「學校體育與社會體育、」其主要之點、在闡明社會體育的重要、不亞於學校體育、並且學校體育必與社會體育相輔而行、才能發生效力其中有幾句發聾振瞶的話、「……統觀縱橫、論功」考實、我才敢說體育是人生必要的敎育、也是人生不可一日間缺的敎育、人類縱有性别年齡智愚强弱貧富……的差分、需要體育是一樣的、至多不過分量方式的變換而已、因爲健全的體魄、明敏的腦筋、快活的精神、合用的技、術適應環境的心性習慣、不論你是男是女、是少是老、是智是愚、是强是弱是貧是富、……於現在或將來、一律急切的需要、即一律塲兒童遊樂園的章程及細則、「建築及設備」章、列有各等體育塲應有的建築設繼續不斷的企求、關連的程度、與魯之於水、花木之於陽光雨露、相差無幾、所以、學校之内有體育、學校之外無體育、根本上不能成立這種說素、學校體育更重於社會體育、完成了學校體育之後、再講社會體育、也是一種不通之主張、一他的結論是、「公共體育塲的設立、在整個的敎育計劃中、决不可缺漏的、尤其在重文輕武沿爲習尙的中國、」</p>
<p>據我個人看來、全書最有價値的部份要算第三章、「辦理公共體育塲的方略」了、著者憑着透達的眼光、毅然决然的揭示辦理體育塲的方略、（一）要使大多數人來塲運動、（二）要使來塲運動的人、發生濃厚的興趣、（三）要使樂習運動的人、得到極完美的體育功效、我想公共體育塲的設施社會體育、儘有千變萬化的方式、總脫不了這三個目標、假使認錯了一點、就有走入歧途的危險、所以籠絡若干選手支撑門面不是個好體育塲、運動的人、甲來乙去、淺嘗即止也、不是個好體育塲、運動塲上、雖然十分熱閙、只是一味的蠻幹、不能使個個人具有勇健的體魄、愉快的精、神謙和的態度、也不是個好體育塲、換言之、在體育塲附近的居民、應當都到體育塲來、習有定時的天天都到體育塲來、久而久之、都造成了壯健有爲的人材、好像從個模型裏鑄出來的、到了這個地步、公共體育塲、才不辱它的使命、如其吾國各地徧設體育、塲個個體育塲達到這個標準、社會的安寗、國家的鞏固、民族的勃興、可不期然而然了</p>
<p>辦理體育塲的同志們、不要氣餒、以爲眼前的障礙太、多難以依照目標、逕向前行、你須知下一分的工夫、即有一分的效力、有一分的效力、即有一部份人的信從、有部份人的信從、即得到一部份人的助力、由近及遠積少成多、到了外人信從、效騐大著的時候、一切障礙、悉可化爲烏有、所以、我對於著者所提示的三個目標、十二分的贊同、</p>
<p>以下若「組織」「建築及設備」「開放」「管理」「工作」頭章可說全是達到這三個目標的手段、因爲著者着筆、處處本之經騐、忠實地報告、秘以議論警關、步驟井然、尤妙在各各羅舉實例確示辦法、像「組織」章、列有公共體育塲、簡易體育備、及建築設備的方法都繪有圖樣、開明尺寸、「開放」章、列有各等運動塲各部份開放運動的時間表、「管理」章、列有入場、借場、借物、寄物、入浴、游泳等規定、場地整理、器械檢查、工役支配等手續、「工作」章、分表演、講演、標語、刋、物設備、組織比賽、指導鼓勵……等節目都有很週密的具體的辦法、可以敎人按圖索驥、在這許多質實的報告、中深信著者仍不脫實行家的本色、</p>
<p>我不敢說體育指南是本完美無疵的社會體育書籍、但敢說是我國研究社會體育的先導我們可於此中、認識並解决公共體育場是付麽、設立公共體育場爲什麽公共體育場應怎樣辦理等問題、</p>
<p>像這樣有用的書籍、辦理體育行政的人員、専修體育的學生、固宜人手編、即研究敎育、關心社會問題的人士、也應細細的閱讀一過、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Another Dyke Reported Dangerous in Wuhan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Emergency Relief Committee Organizes Consumer Cooperative</p>
<p>Hankou and Wuhan experienced a drop of about one inch in water level on the 24th. However, the Jinshui Dyke in Wuchang and the Zongguan Dyke in Hankou have also been reported as dangerous and are currently being reinforced. If the Jinshui Dyke breaches, Chang Street in Wuchang will not be secure. If the Zongguan Dyke breaches, the Hankou water plant will also be in a critical situation, and the calamity will be even more unimaginable. Due to the shortage of supplies and the extreme difficulty in purchasing daily necessities, the Emergency Relief Committee has organized a consumer cooperative to supply the citizens, forming four teams to patrol the streets, with Wang Senfu and others as team leaders. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>More than 440,000 flood refugees have arrived in Hankou and Wuhan. Providing relief and shelter is extremely difficult. In addition, disaster victims from various counties continue to seek refuge in Hankou. There are signs that bandits and communists are taking the opportunity to infiltrate. The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters is guarding key locations outside the city to prevent disaster victims from various counties from entering the city. After strict inspection, they are accommodated within a designated area, and they are not allowed to step outside the area. However, when the flood subsides in the future, it is feared that Wuhan will see an era of rampant beggars and thieves. (24th Electric Communication Society Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Tokyo Dojinkai (a medical society) is organizing a relief team for the severe floods in the Wuhan area. Based at the Qingdao Hospital, it will consist of three doctors, four or five nurses, and fourteen or fifteen other pharmacists and office staff. They will depart for the Wuhan area within days, focusing on Hankou, and will stay for two months to provide relief to the flood victims. (24th Electric Communication Society Dispatch)</p>

<p>Dyke Work Still Needs Reinforcement</p>
<p>Yang Baohan, a special commissioner appointed by the Ministry of Interior in Nanjing to investigate the water situation of the Jiangbei Canal, has returned to the capital after completing his task. He reported that although the canal water level has dropped slightly, the dyke work is still dangerous and needs to be actively reinforced. He requested that the central government allocate funds to purchase 20,000 dan of firewood and several thousand wooden piles to be handed over to the Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau for emergency reinforcement purposes. After the dangerous period has passed, the Che'nan and Xin'san Dams should be blocked and built as soon as possible so that the counties in the lower reaches of the river can sow two crops of wheat at the same time.

<p>Jinan: The Kangtun People's Embankment in the upper reaches of the Yellow River was reported to be in critical condition on the 22nd.

Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, is currently inspecting Zhukoukou Village in the upper reaches. Due to the rain, Luokou in the middle reaches rose three inches this morning.

<p>Nanjing: Regarding the American wheat loan, according to information from the American side, the Chinese government has not yet sent a responsible person to negotiate.

Lin's purpose is to lend cash to China to increase the price of silver. Also, the Jewish advisor to China, Vice-Minister Minz, has a different view from Lin Bai-ke. The US has telegraphed, advocating that the loan should be calculated in gold dollars, and that if American wheat is purchased, it should also be converted into gold dollars. The government intends to send a member to the United States to be responsible for negotiating and signing the contract, but it is feared that the signing will have to take place after the Double Ten Festival.

<p>Note Sent Out Yesterday Morning Sharply Refuting Japanese Reply</p>
<p>Demanding Punishment of Culprits, Apology, Compensation, Etc.</p>
<p>Nanjing: Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has exchanged two notes with the Japanese Ambassador regarding the case of the massacre of overseas Chinese in the Korean riot, the Chinese side, due to incomplete reports from various places, has only asked the Japanese side to effectively stop it and be responsible for protection, and has not yet proposed a solution. The Japanese side, on the other hand, elaborates on the efforts of local officials to prevent, protect, and provide post-disaster relief, in an attempt to shirk responsibility. Now, based on the reports from Ambassador Wang and various consulates, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared a third note, pointing out that the Korean authorities have not fulfilled their due responsibilities for the attitude and behavior of the case before and after the event. According to international law, the Japanese side should bear full responsibility. The note sharply refutes the Japanese side's claims and puts forward specific demands, such as punishing the culprits, apologizing, punishing responsible officials, compensating for loss of life and property, and guaranteeing the future. The note has been sent to the Japanese Ambassador, asking him to fulfill it. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>"Strive to Treat Others with Benevolence,</p>
<p>But Not Allow Others to Treat Us with Tyranny"</p>
<p>Nanjing: At the weekly memorial service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning, Wang Zhengting reported on the diplomatic situation. He first stated that Ambassador Jiang to Japan could depart in early September. There are many pending cases between China and Japan. After Jiang's departure, he should be able to consult the Ministry and find a way to resolve them in the shortest possible time. The candidate for the ambassador to Germany has been agreed upon by Liu Wendao, and has been recognized by both Germany and Austria. Once approved by the State Council, it will be submitted to the National Government for publication. Next, he stated that the country is like a whole body, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the mouth of the body, the organ that represents the country to express its will. One word can make a country flourish, and one word can destroy a country, so the relationship is significant. In handling diplomacy, one must carefully consider the domestic and international situation, and proceed with caution. Do not be rash for a moment and leave disaster to the whole. Although there are countries that rely solely on force, disregard credit, and can succeed for a while, in the end, they will inevitably suffer losses. Our country has always rejected hegemony and advocated benevolent countries, and often suffers from a lack of preparedness. When others treat us with tyranny, we have difficulties. Therefore, our country should strive to treat others with benevolence in the future, but not allow others to treat us with tyranny. For this, we must have sufficient strength and a prosperous economy. He also said that knowing oneself and one's enemy leads to a hundred battles and a hundred victories. Diplomats must also understand the domestic and international situation, study the facts, and handle matters responsibly. If one is merely driven by anger, like an electric bell that rings when pressed, it is easy to cause chaos, especially for those who bear great responsibility in diplomacy. Finally, he stated that the abolition of extraterritoriality still has one or two countries that have not resolved the issue, but we have announced that it will be completely abolished on January 1, 1932. It must be done by the due date, regardless of all the consequences. Whether the organization of the courts is comprehensive and whether the prison facilities are complete should be recognized by the world. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

Chinese expatriates marrying in foreign countries may adopt local customs for their ceremonies. However, the legality of the marriage should be examined in accordance with Chinese civil law before registration. (2) A concubine has no legal status and should not be allowed to naturalize simply because she is willing to be a concubine. However, she can apply for naturalization in accordance with Article 3 of the Nationality Law.

(4) Children of Chinese expatriates naturally acquire Chinese nationality in accordance with Article _ Paragraph 1 of the Nationality Law.

<h3 id="e51">Reflections on the Japanese Emperor's Assistance to the Flood Disaster <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>During our recent flood disaster, many countries around the world have extended their sympathy. Countries such as Britain and the United States have sent telegrams of condolence one after another. Recently, the Japanese Emperor has also allocated 100,000 Japanese yen as a powerful financial aid for our disaster relief and reconstruction efforts. For this sincere friendship of disaster relief and neighborly care, and the noblest sympathy for all people, we, in addition to receiving it gratefully, would like to express our sincere gratitude. Moreover, Japan and our country are separated by only a strip of water, and the relationship is very close. At a time when negotiations between the two countries have been urgent, we feel that we cannot but express our gratitude for the Japanese Emperor's great kindness in helping with disaster relief.</p>
<p>China and Japan are both located in East Asia. In terms of interests, they are interdependent; in terms of race, they are like brothers. If China and Japan could truly uphold the principles of equality, amity, helping others, and helping themselves, and work together towards the path of coexistence and co-prosperity, seeking lasting peace in East Asia, it would be a matter of course. However, based on the historical facts of Sino-Japanese negotiations over the past few decades, they are all photographs of shame and repeated whip marks and bloodstains for our country and our nation. Who is responsible for this? Who caused it? How can the Chinese people forget it for even a day? How can they bear to forget it for even a day? In recent years, Sino-Japanese relations have deteriorated even further. What have the Japanese gained? This is something that deserves deep thought. To seek the true benefit of both countries, the key lies in the sincere cooperation of both countries. And sincere cooperation is more important than sincere expressions in facts. It is by no means self-entertaining in high-sounding tones of friendship and peace, nor is it the compassionate giving of small favors and small benefits. The bloodstains of our compatriots who died in Korea have not yet dried. The wounded have not yet recovered. Their properties have all been wiped out. Recently, there have also been incidents of Japanese people in Qingdao gathering crowds to stir up trouble. The Japanese cause trouble for us on one hand, and help us with disaster relief on the other. Is it a blessing or a curse? It is truly doubtful and unresolved.</p>
<p>If the Japanese truly sympathize with us and truly create blessings for us, then they should focus on the far-reaching and major issues. What are the far-reaching and major issues? That is to automatically abandon all unequal treaties between China and Japan and fundamentally change its policy towards China. Unequal treaties are shackles that bind the freedom of our country and our nation, and they are also what our people feel heartbroken about and cannot forget for even a day. If the Japanese could resolutely and decisively declare their abandonment, advocating for all countries in the world, that would truly create blessings for our country and truly create blessings for our people. In more advanced terms, it would also create blessings for East Asia and even the world. Therefore, the Japanese Emperor's sympathy for the flood disaster in our country is truly commendable. But we deeply hope that the Japanese Emperor can expand his sympathy and actually remove the shackles that bind the freedom of our country and our nation. If this move can be realized, the Japanese will truly be able to proudly announce to the world, "This is a righteous act for the world. Those who doubt this are criminals against justice."</p>
<p>Recalling the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan on September 1, 1923, the Beijing government immediately convened a special cabinet meeting on September 3 to establish the Japan Disaster Relief Association, allocating 200,000 yuan to help with disaster relief (overseas Chinese in Japan separately allocated 100,000 yuan). It also relaxed the ban on rice exports. The Guangdong side established the Japan Disaster Relief Association, with Wu Chaoshu and Liao Zhongkai as the chairman and vice-chairman. The Shanghai side established the China Japan Disaster Relief Association, donating 120,000 yuan in relief supplies and sending the Xinming Steamer to transport rice for relief. The Tianjin side established the Disaster Relief Comrades Association. The Northeast side also donated 500,000 yuan in relief supplies. Zhang Zuolin personally donated 100,000 yuan. Duan Qirui personally donated 100,000 yuan. Cao Kun donated 40,000 yuan. Xu Shichang, Cao Rulin, and others each donated several yuan. Donations poured in from all over the country, and the enthusiasm is still vividly remembered. At that time, the Japanese disaster was a sudden and unexpected event, and everyone felt that it was serious. This time, the flood disaster in our country came more slowly, so people have slightly neglected it. In fact, the seriousness of the current flood disaster in our country may even exceed the earthquake in Japan at that time, and it is definitely not less serious. We say this not to settle old scores with the Japanese. But one thing deeply impressed in our minds and cannot be forgotten, that is, our people, while trying their best to recover Lushun and Dalian, still urgently helped others and enthusiastically provided relief. They did not reduce their enthusiasm for helping the Japanese disaster because the Japanese stubbornly refused to return Lushun and Dalian. We believe that this attitude is enough to show the spirit of peace and universal love of the Chinese nation. But how have the Japanese treated us over the years? Do we owe the Japanese, or do the Japanese owe us? The past is not far away. Let the Japanese think deeply about it.</p>

<h3 id="e59">British Labour Cabinet Resigns En Masse <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Three Parties Jointly Form a New Government to Jointly Save the Financial Crisis</p>
<p>Major Developments in the Political Situation Indicate a Collapse of the Labour Party</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: MacDonald has resigned and is now forming a national government. MacDonald will remain as Prime Minister. This was announced by MacDonald himself at the last cabinet meeting today. This is seen as a sign of strict austerity measures, and it is believed that cabinet members who oppose saving funds for social affairs, such as Henderson, Alexander, and Klein, will be excluded from the new government. Henderson's resignation is the most difficult, as the League of Nations conference is about to open, and Henderson has been elected as the chairman of the Disarmament Conference. It is expected that MacDonald may attend the conference in Geneva in place of Henderson. Former Governor-General of India Lord Irwin is said to be a candidate for Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: The developments of the political situation on Sunday evening are roughly as follows: At 7 PM, the cabinet met at 10 Downing Street. At that time, thousands of people had gathered near Buckingham Palace and Downing Street. The government's resignation was expected at any moment. At 10:15 PM, MacDonald hurriedly took a car from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace. Those who saw him said that his face was pale and he looked deeply worried. Therefore, the rioting crowd thought that MacDonald's entry into the palace was to submit his resignation. At 10:40 PM, MacDonald returned to Downing Street, having stayed in the palace for only fifteen minutes. After MacDonald met with his colleagues, the cabinet adjourned at 10:47 PM. The crowd initially thought that the organization of the new cabinet was almost certain, but a few minutes later, Samuel arrived at Downing Street. Shortly after, Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain also arrived one after another. The crowd's expectations suddenly changed. The three party leaders met until ten minutes after midnight before ending. Baldwin came out first, and then Samuel also came out. It was then learned that no announcement would be made at Downing Street that night. Therefore, the crowd dispersed, knowing that the midnight meeting had clearly indicated that the Prime Minister had failed to dispel the opposition of a few cabinet members to the government's austerity proposals, and that there would be an attempt to form a national government jointly by the three parties on Monday. MacDonald will serve as the Prime Minister of the new cabinet, and Baldwin is willing to provide assistance. This development is nothing short of a collapse of the Labour Party. MacDonald's and Snowden's credibility within the party has recently been shaken, and now many comrades will resolutely break with them. Therefore, the final result of this political crisis is that the British Labour movement will be dim for some time to come. It is heard that ten cabinet members have declined to join the new government, which is enough to show the depth of the rift in the Labour Party. Among these ten people are Foreign Secretary Henderson, Trade Minister Green, Home Secretary Klein, Naval Minister Alexander, and Minister of Labour Lansbury. They will be supported by most of the Labour members of the House of Commons. The Conservative and Liberal parties together hold 320 seats in the House of Commons, while the Labour Party has only 286 seats, so they are powerless to resist. The national government is expected to win more than 320 seats in the election. Reuters, London, 23rd: At the request of Prime Minister MacDonald, the British Emperor summoned Conservative Party's Baldwin and Liberal Party's Samuel to Buckingham Palace, as the Emperor wanted to hear the opinions of the two political parties. The political circles regard this as the latest development. The Emperor is now using his personal influence to achieve the three-party meeting that the government has been planning for the past half month, so as to agree on a common policy to deal with the current serious situation. Samuel entered the palace for half an hour today, and Baldwin entered to see the Emperor at 3 PM for three quarters of an hour before coming out with a smile. The cabinet was still in session from 7 PM to 10:15 PM. MacDonald then entered the palace, but did not submit his resignation. He talked with the Emperor for a quarter of an hour and rushed back to his residence at 10:40 PM. The cabinet adjourned at 10:47 PM. Liberal Party's Samuel then visited the Prime Minister and telegraphed again, opening a three-party meeting at midnight. Those who participated in the meeting were Prime Minister MacDonald, Conservative Party's Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain, and Liberal Party's Samuel. At 12:10 AM, the two key figures of the Conservative Party left the Prime Minister's residence. Shortly after, Samuel also left. It was then learned that no announcement would be issued tonight.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, London, 24th: Today, financial circles claim that the 50 million pounds sterling that the Bank of France and the US Federal Reserve Bank recently lent to the Bank of England has almost been used up. This amount has been used in the past ten days to maintain the pound's price to avoid falling. It is now rumored here that negotiations on the Bank of England continuing to borrow huge amounts of money have begun again, as cash has been flowing out of England, causing the pound to fall, and extraordinary measures must be used to maintain its value.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Karolyi Concurrently Serves as Minister of Finance</p>
<p>New International Loan Established Simultaneously</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Budapest, 23rd: Prime Minister Count Karolyi led his new cabinet to be sworn in at the Regent's Palace this afternoon. Two members of the old cabinet were reappointed. After the ceremony, Regent Horthy received the outgoing Prime Minister Count Bethlen and thanked him for his assistance in forming the Karolyi cabinet, as Karolyi's acceptance of the mandate to form a cabinet was almost desperate. Fortunately, Bethlen did his best on Saturday night to persuade the government and the party to lend assistance, so the Karolyi cabinet was able to emerge. However, Karolyi has still not been able to find a magnate to serve as Minister of Finance and has had to serve as Minister himself. Karolyi himself originally intended to serve concurrently as Foreign Minister, but he also had to appoint Dr. Walko to take over. After the announcement of the formation of the new cabinet, the French, Italian, Dutch, and Swiss syndicates immediately lent Hungary a new loan of 5 million pounds, with a repayment period of eighteen months. Although the interest rate was not explicitly stated, it is said to be quite high. After the conclusion of the new loan negotiations, the new Prime Minister announced that Hungary is an agricultural country. The global economic panic has thrown the finances out of balance, and Hungary has suffered especially badly. It can now gradually recover. Parisian newspapers have unanimously praised the new Hungarian cabinet. Le Matin said that the new Foreign Minister Dr. Walko is well-known in Paris and is also an astute financier.</p>

Therefore, it has dispatched 30,000 troops to the areas where the unrest is brewing to show military force. It has also closed three Catholic newspapers, banned public gatherings, and the cruiser Libertad has arrived in Bilbao, ready to assist the army in suppressing the rebellion if necessary. The government has asked the Roman Catholic Church to withdraw the cardinals and others stationed in Spain, which has made Catholics even more indignant.</p>

Mr. Tanaka, the representative of the Japanese Ministry of Communications, and the counselor of the US Embassy were both present to greet them. According to reports, after Lindbergh flew to here from Moroton Bay yesterday, he had to fly back to Kunashir Island (transliteration) because of heavy fog and could not land. He departed at 7:25 this morning. Fortunately, the sky was clear, and he was able to land on Sakashita Beach. It is now scheduled to fly back to Kasumigaura near Tokyo on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Chinese People Should Be Alert and Vigilant</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Washington, 23rd: The US President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Crime has issued another report today on the crimes committed by foreigners. It is said that in San Francisco in 1929, a total of 23,408 foreigners were arrested for crimes, including 6,293 Chinese, accounting for 5.57% of the total. The Chinese population only accounts for 1.53% of the total number of foreigners in the city. However, most of the crimes committed by the Chinese are gambling, and even the most serious ones are only private trafficking in narcotics. Also, many Filipinos were arrested, and most of the crimes they committed were also gambling. There are a total of 53,058 Japanese residents, and only 99 of them were arrested for crimes. From this, we can see that the education of overseas Chinese cannot be delayed, and the Chinese people's fondness for gambling should also be taken as a warning.</p>

<p>Wu Jingheng and Shao Yuancong Both Report on Flood Issues</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on August 24th, the Central Party Headquarters held a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at the auditorium. Attendees included Central Committee members Wu Jingheng, Ding Weifen, Chen Lifu, Fang Juehui, Miao Peicheng, Ke Xing'e, as well as officials and staff from various departments and guests, totaling about 500 people. Chairman Ding Weifen presided. After the ceremony, Wu Jingheng reported that recent natural disasters and human calamities have occurred in rapid succession. Unprecedented floods have occurred within the country, which is a great misfortune for the nation. Every time I think of the origin of the disaster, I must say it is the failure of materialism to be thoroughly implemented. The material equipment required for disaster prevention and all water conservancy is inferior to ancient water management strategies and modern water conservancy science. Regarding material progress, the principle lies in using human spiritual ability to control matter and not allowing human safety, danger, misfortune, and fortune to be controlled by matter. The Premier has clearly explained this purpose. The Book of Changes says, "Prepare things to use, establish tools for the benefit of the world; nothing is greater than the sage." It can be seen that those who are good at using beneficial tools are by no means those who are lazy and incompetent can achieve their effectiveness. From this, I feel that we should examine the subtle details between ourselves and others when we conduct ourselves in the world. The Premier has invented (Great Harmony of Nationalities) and the principle of "the world as the public," with seven parts for others and three parts for oneself, correcting the selfish and self-interested view, rushing to the public good to maintain the life of the nation and eliminate common disasters. The way of governing lies in loving the people. If the happiness of the people is the premise, then there is no government that cannot be raised. Those in the world who embrace capitalism are based on the deep thought of loving themselves. Although Marxism calls for communism, its traces are close to loving people. However, looking at its measures and speculating on its results, it will gradually change from collectivism to specialism, which is not much different from capitalism. In the old Chinese morality, there is the doctrine of self-restraint, but it must be restrained in what is right. Restraint that puts others before oneself is the way of great impartiality. If the argument is too high, then it is as good as not enough. At present, the materials needed for the livelihood of the Chinese people are very scarce, and the degree of material evolution is very slow. Everyone should work together with one heart, following the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and taking the words "respect, admiration, diligence, and hard work" as golden needles, striving hard to control all materials with great strength, and solving the current and future difficulties in the people's livelihood, etc. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM after the report.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week.

<p>Inspect Shanxi Politics and Urge Yan to Leave Shanxi</p>
<p>Xu Will Go to Peiping to Meet Zhang for Instructions</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since Yan Xishan returned to Shanxi, on the surface, the situation in Shanxi seems to be very peaceful. However, the atmosphere urging Yan to leave Shanxi is very strong. Although Yan has returned and expressed that he will not interfere in the current situation, his relationship with his subordinates is still difficult to sever. Xu Yongchang was originally a subordinate of Yan, and now he has been appointed as the chairman of Shanxi Province. It is quite difficult to deal with this situation. Ge Jingen and Bao Wenwei arrived in Shanxi on the evening of the 16th. It is rumored that they are inspecting the political situation in Shanxi, but the main task is to discuss with Xu how to urge Yan to leave Shanxi. Therefore, Ge and others briefly interacted with Xu immediately after getting off the train, and then walked together to the Shanxi Grand Hotel. They once agreed on the political situation in Shanxi that night. On the 17th, Ge and others took a car into the city and visited Xu and various generals. In the evening, Xu and others hosted a banquet for Ge and others at the hotel. After the banquet, they made a second agreement, and did not disperse until late at night.</p>
<p>According to Ge Jingen's speech, it is said that the brothers were ordered by Chairman Chiang to come to Shanxi for inspection. Later, due to Shi Yousan's rebellion,</p>

<p>News Highlights</p>
<p>I was unable to come sooner. Now that Shi's troops have been completely resolved, I came with Vice Minister Bao and others. Commander-in-Chief Jiang and Deputy Commander Zhang are very concerned about the situation in Shanxi. Shanxi Province has recently had many difficulties due to too many stationed troops and financial disorder. Therefore, the Central Government is specially preparing measures to gradually improve the future of Shanxi. As for Yan's sudden return to Shanxi this time, rumors have flourished, and some even say that the Central Government and Commander-in-Chief Jiang had given permission in advance. This kind of rumor is definitely not true. If Yan's return to Shanxi is only to visit relatives and has no other effect, the Central Government has always been lenient and will not delve into it excessively.</p>
<p>Since Shang Zhen left Shanxi, the position of Chairman of the Provincial Government was temporarily held by Qiu Zengyi, the Director of Finance. Later, Xu Yongchang was ordered to act as the agent. Xu has already submitted a telegram on the 10th and took office on the same day. However, Xu has not yet gone to the Provincial Government to work, and the date of his official inauguration is said to be decided after he goes to Peiping to meet with Zhang for instructions. The Provincial Government is preparing for the handover, and Secretary-General Li Jingrong has already gone to Shijiazhuang to consult and ask for instructions on the handover method. The Provincial Government committees and department heads are not expected to change before Xu goes to Peiping to meet with Zhang. It is reported that Xu has drafted a specific plan for the policy guidelines. The main points are: (1) to follow the Central Government's intentions and implement political tutelage; (2) to implement good governance based on the suffering of the people of Shanxi; (3) to eliminate bandits in various places within a time limit; (4) to stabilize the province's finances in the shortest possible time. Xu also stated that he would not make many changes to the internal personnel of the Provincial Government. (August 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Consultation on Solutions to the Qingdao Japanese Assault Case <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Rogues Still Seek Trouble Everywhere</p>
<p>Qingdao Press Deals with Japanese Newspaper Spreading Rumors</p>
<p>Municipal Government Asks to Disband the National Essence Society</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The case of Japanese residents in Qingdao injuring Chinese people on Liaoning Road on the 18th of this month is currently under negotiation. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Prevention After the Incident: The Japanese side still feels that the goal has not been achieved. Members of the Japanese National Essence Society still set out in full force day and night to demonstrate and create disturbances, deliberately insulting Chinese people in the hope of provoking Chinese resentment and expanding the unrest. However, the citizens have already seen through the Japanese plot and mostly avoid the road or hide at home. The municipal government has strengthened prevention, adding police officers and posts at night for maintenance, and sending plainclothes detectives to monitor secretly. Security teams patrol in shifts, so no more incidents have occurred.</p>
<p>Results of the Investigation by Both Sides: In order to resolve misunderstandings, the municipal government specially dispatched commissioners to meet with Japanese Vice Consul Ioki and notary German doctor Weishi Ying to investigate the incident and the condition of the injured people on both sides. It has now been completed and reported to the municipal government for review. The general idea of the report is that they immediately went to the scene of the incident to investigate and saw that two pieces of glass in the room of Japanese Shima Shoaki were damaged. According to the police officers at the scene, the incident was caused by Shima Shoaki, the manager of the fish shop, prohibiting Chinese Meng Jirui from chatting with the Chinese workers in the shop, which led to a conflict. Shima then beat Meng Jirui with wooden clogs, and the police officers who stepped forward to mediate were also injured by iron hooks. Only one person among the onlookers was indignant and smashed the shop's glass with a stone. Shima immediately telegraphed dozens of members of the National Essence Society to take knives and clubs and indiscriminately beat the Chinese onlookers. Some were injured on the spot because they could not escape, and some were injured and fell to the ground after reaching Zhangqiu Road and Boxing Road. Therefore, the Chinese people were mostly injured on their heads and backs. Then the Japanese people gathered more and more, and it was difficult to distinguish how many in the chaos. However, the speed of the Japanese gathering seemed to be planned in advance. Moreover, this case was caused by Shima's interference in the Chinese people's chatting and his first use of force, not to mention that when the police officers went to mediate, Shima beat the police officers instead. When the order was disturbed, he did not telegraph the Chinese and Japanese officials to come to the scene to suppress, but telegraphed the members of the National Essence Society who had nothing to do with local security. It is not difficult to imagine that he intended to find trouble. According to reports, the National Essence Society is a violent organization and has repeatedly committed crimes. This time, many people gathered in a short period of time and crowded in. Who would believe it if there was no plan in advance? As for the injured Chinese people, they claimed to have different addresses and occupations and were unarmed. The scars were mostly on the back, and it was obvious that they were chased by the Japanese. Moreover, among the injured people, there was a child of only thirteen years old. How could people with no ability to resist join the fight? They were cut with knives and injured their brains. The violent behavior of the Japanese side is enough to prove this.</p>
<p>Public Outrage: After this case occurred, all sectors of the city were extremely angry. The Journalists Association specially convened an emergency meeting and resolved three cases: (1) Regarding the case of Japanese people killing Chinese people, it was resolved to send telegrams to the whole country for unanimous support and to publicize the truth of this case internationally. (2) The Japanese used news policies to create the Massacre of Koreans in Manchuria. Now the Japanese newspapers in the city are still using their usual tricks to fabricate sensational propaganda. The resolution is to deal with it as follows: (a) Send a letter to the authorities to prohibit postal delivery; (b) Notify the citizens to stop subscribing and publishing advertisements; (3) The newspapers in the city should write more propaganda to promote national attention. Moreover, the Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Conference in the city also held a meeting today (22nd) and resolved two cases: (1) Send a letter to the municipal government for serious protest; (2) Send letters and telegrams to anti-Japanese and aid-to-overseas-Chinese committees in various places, explaining the truth of the incident and asking for unanimous resistance. The city's Party Headquarters also issued a declaration on the Japanese National Essence Society's crime, and other groups also expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>Consultation on Solutions: In order to settle the matter and appease the people, the municipal government does not want the case to expand. In addition to protesting to the Japanese consulate, it also asked the Japanese consul to disband the National Essence Society that caused the trouble as soon as possible. As for the injuries on both sides, the Chinese and Japanese sides have jointly sent personnel to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and report the case. Right and wrong can be judged fairly, and it is also heard that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will send personnel to consult on solutions to the case on the 23rd. It seems that this case will not expand again.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Reports the Incident: The municipal government issued a telegram yesterday to announce the incident, as inquiries about the truth of the case have come from all over the country. The original telegram said, "At 9:00 PM on the 18th of this month, in front of a Japanese fish shop on Liaoning Road in the city, a Chinese Meng Jirui was chatting with a Chinese cook Liu from the shop when he was driven away by Shima Shoaki, the manager of the shop, which led to a conflict. Shima then took off his clogs and injured Meng Jirui's face. The police officer who heard the news went to mediate, but Shima injured the police officer with an iron hook used in the fish shop. One of the onlookers, a Chinese who was indignant, threw a stone and broke a piece of glass in the shop's window. Shima immediately invited members of the National Essence Society, organized by Japanese rogues, to the scene with knives and clubs. The crowd dispersed and then chased after them, causing eight Chinese people to be injured by knives and several people to be injured by clubs. Two patrol officers were injured by knives and clubs. Among the injured were a thirteen-year-old child and an old man over fifty years old. There were even more people who were injured by falling. The municipal government immediately ordered the security police team to the scene to suppress them as much as possible before they dispersed. This is the general situation of the case. Afterwards, the municipal government protested, and the Japanese side also raised negotiations. We immediately asked the Japanese consulate to send personnel to investigate and invited the German doctor Weishi Ying, a well-known doctor from a third country, to examine the injuries for corroboration. As for the Japanese side, there were also more than a dozen people injured, but they all fell and were only slightly injured. Wei also clarified this. The cause of this case was just a minor quarrel. If Shima had telegraphed the Chinese and Japanese authorities to send someone to mediate at that time, this incident would never have happened. The so-called National Essence Society is a violent group that has committed crimes in the past. This time, many people gathered in a short period of time, carrying weapons and rushing in. It is evident that they were looking for trouble and had a plan in advance. The Chinese people were unarmed, and the scars were mostly on their backs, which showed the pursuit. The municipal government is now asking the Japanese consul to disband the society as soon as possible. The injuries on both sides will be investigated and discussed. In the meantime, the police will be ordered to prevent any further complications. Fearing that the distant reports are untrue, we hereby announce this. Seal of Qingdao Municipal Government" (August 22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e73">Korean侨计划暴动 <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Report by the Diplomacy Association</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: The local branch of the National Diplomacy Association recently received a telegram from the National Diplomacy Association in Linjiang County, on the Yalu River, saying, "It has recently been heard that the Korean residents in the Tianqiaogou area have been secretly gathering under the instigation of a certain party, and have agreed to collude with unscrupulous elements of the Korean Youth Party on the other side of the Korean River in mid-July of the lunar calendar to cross the Yalu River secretly and massacre Chinese civilians. Our association has confirmed this through investigation. In addition to leading the public to strictly guard against this, we also send a telegram to your association to jointly assist in exposing the conspiracy, stopping the riots, and curbing the unrest to stabilize the people's hearts." After receiving the telegram, the local Diplomacy Support Association has taken precautions. According to a guest who returned from Linjiang five days ago, there are 6,889 Korean residents in Linjiang County, of which farmers account for about 80 to 90 percent. These people have always been law-abiding. Since the previous massacre of Chinese civilians by Korean rioters, the Chinese authorities have feared that the Korean residents there would be incited by treacherous people, and have long taken precautions. However, at the beginning of this month, two Korean youths wearing student uniforms suddenly came across the river from Manpu Town in West Korea. They claimed to be named Park and Kim, and were studying at an agricultural school in the capital. Because of the Massacre of Koreans in Manchuria, they were afraid that the rumors were untrue and would hinder the good relations between the two sides, so they came to promote the facts to the Korean residents and dispel misunderstandings. Although the two youths said this on the surface, their actions were quite suspicious. Every evening, they gathered local influential Korean residents for secret talks that lasted all night. At this time, the Tonghua Consular Branch had already learned about this, so it secretly sent staff and inspectors, disguised as merchants, to follow the two youths and investigate their actions. They were indeed inciting the Korean residents. They were planning to order the police to arrest them and send them to the case for investigation, but the two youths had already fled after hearing the news and returned to Manpu Town across the river. Less than ten days after this incident, there was a surge of riots among the Korean residents there. According to the results of the investigation by the Chinese authorities, the two youths who entered the country were indeed suspected of instigating the Korean residents to plan the riots. Therefore, they have separately ordered their subordinates to be on guard." (August 19th)</p>

Then they spoke to the press for five minutes. Uchida answered the reporters' questions, saying, "Sino-Japanese relations must be mutually understanding to achieve increasing friendship. The Sino-Japanese railway issue will not be discussed early due to the change in the South Manchuria Railway's organizational system. The policy and timing of the discussions will be handled by Director Kimura. The purpose of the South Manchuria Railway's reduction is to adjust the treatment of senior and junior employees."

<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since the 13th, Shantou has been overcast with thick clouds in the sky. White waves have been surging at sea, and ships have been forbidden from going out. According to the Customs report, a hurricane has occurred in the Ningbo and Wenzhou sea areas, and Weisheng has hit a reef. Guangsheng, which departed from Shanghai to Shantou, has gone missing midway. The wind has been even stronger on the 14th and 15th.

<p>Jining Correspondence: Jining, Shandong Province, straddles the Grand Canal and is a prosperous county in western Shandong. This year, before the start of the dog days, when the autumn crops were being cultivated, there was heavy rain, and many autumn crops were flooded. After entering the dog days, the weather was not clear, and the climate was cool, which was very different from the past. Then, the twelve consecutive depressions in the upper reaches of Jiaxiang, Juye, Shanxian, Caoxian, Dingtao, Heze, and Chengwu counties burst, and the water overflowed and poured into Jining, causing the east, west, and other parts of the city to be submerged in water. Recently, the weather has turned hot, and it has been raining continuously. In addition, the water from the Wen River, Si River, Guang River, and Fu River has risen sharply at the same time and rushed from the east, its momentum is fierce and cannot be protected, causing the land east and north of the city to be flooded. Now, the outside of the city is a vast expanse of water, which has become a lake. The ship cannot travel out of the city gate. The water on the plain is about four or five feet, and the water in the deep depressions is even deeper. In addition to the fields being flooded, houses have collapsed and people have drowned. It has not been possible to investigate clearly. It is truly an unprecedented disaster. (August 21st)</p>

<p>Verdict in the Murder Case at Malu Bridge: On the 3rd of last month, Wang Aosheng, a hawker selling dim sum, usually sold cakes and pastries at the Malu Bridge pier, meeting the needs of passing travelers and merchants. He did this every day and became familiar with the boatmen, gradually engaging in monetary transactions. However, on the morning of that day, Wang went to the pier again, and was asked for repayment by Ma Liansheng, a boat owner. They argued and then fought. Zhang Changshun and Wu Xiude, boatmen nearby, also joined the fight. Wang Aosheng was in extreme pain and fell. He was taken to Ruoshe Hospital, but died due to lack of medical treatment. The County Court Procuratorate, led by Chief Prosecutor Zhu, inspected and filled out the death certificate, and detained the three murderers, Ma Liansheng, etc., for interrogation. They were prosecuted in the criminal court. After repeated trials and debates, the judge of the criminal court, Li Wenwei, passed a verdict on the 24th, sentencing Ma Liansheng, Zhang Changshun, and Wu Xiude to seven years of imprisonment for the crime of causing death by injury, as a warning.</p>

<p>Lake Bandits Flee to Xin'an Town: Xin'an Town in the county's 13th district is located on the shore of Taihu Lake, with many diverging waterways. The largest ones are the Gao Dun and Sha Dun ports on the south side, and the Da Xi and Xiao Xi ports on the west side. On March 12th, two bandit boats arrived in Xin'an Town, intending to kidnap Dr. Hui Ming. Fortunately, the villagers were well-prepared, and the lake bandits fled back to Taihu Lake. After the incident, Hui immediately moved to the city, and the others with some wealth could not sleep peacefully either. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, several bandit boats suddenly arrived at the Sha Dun port, about three miles south of the Gao Dun port, and the bandits went ashore one after another. Most of the residents there make a living by fishing, and they were all terrified and did not dare to fish. There was originally a detachment of the county police team there, but it has now been transferred to another location, so the defense is very weak. Fortunately, the bandits have not made any other unusual movements. The bandit boats that suddenly arrived this time were due to the active bandit suppression in Huzhou, which sealed off all eight ports along the lake, including Pan Lou Port, Luo Lou Port, Da Lou Port, Shen Lou Port, Tang Jia Port, and An Port, causing the bandits to be unable to hide and flee to Xin'an.</p>
<p>Expected Date for the Opening of the Entire Xicheng Road: The northern section of the Xicheng Road project, since the construction was actively carried out by Ding Qiqian, the director of the Cheng Construction Bureau, has been completed to Qingyang Town, and a long-distance bus service has been implemented on the 20th, with tickets sold and passengers carried at the same time. There are eight round trips between Wuxi and Cheng every day, with many passengers and convenient transportation. Recently, Director Ding Jian has, at the request of the villagers, started work to raise the bridge surface of the Tangnan Bridge in Jiangyin County by three feet to avoid hindering agricultural water conservancy, with a deadline for completion within the month. It is approved that the entire Xicheng Road will be open to traffic from September 1st.</p>
<p>Xiangtai Leather Goods Store Suddenly Goes Bankrupt: Xiangtai Leather Goods Store in Shuyuan Lane, in the city, has been in business since last August for less than a year. It owes customers and merchants seven or eight thousand yuan, which has led to a shortage of funds and sudden bankruptcy. Manager Zhu Yixian not only does not try to remedy the situation, but also avoids meeting people. None of the shareholders has come forward to deal with the matter. All the employees in the store have also left, leaving only a few apprentices inside to guard the store door. Therefore, the creditors, Yun Yujiandzhuang and Hua Xin Yi, two cloth factories, and Jiu Sheng and other firms, yesterday sent a joint official letter to the county chamber of commerce, requesting that the leather goods industry be invited to seal up the store's inventory and property, and requesting that a statement be published in the newspaper, warning all the shareholders of Xiangtai and manager Zhu Yixian to come forward to deal with the matter within a limited time. After the Chamber of Commerce approved the letter, it has already been approved for handling.</p>
<p>Careless Refueling Causes Tragic Burning of Mother and Daughter: Luo Wuda, a villager in Huangniwan, about four miles south of Zhangjing Bridge in the 7th district (Huai Shang Shi), is over fifty years old. His son, Shunquan, is over thirty years old. The father and son are both farmers. Shunquan's wife, Yu, is thirty-two years old and has a son and a daughter. The son's name is Xiaobao, five years old, and the daughter's name is Suzhen, twelve years old. At eight o'clock in the evening the day before, Yu saw that the fuel in the kerosene lamp was running out and was about to go out, so she took the lamp to the door of the room, opened the kerosene tank, and was about to refuel when, unexpectedly, sparks from the lamp fell into the oil tank and immediately caught fire. Seeing that the fire had started, Yu turned around and entered the room to try to save her son, but mistakenly grabbed her daughter Suzhen. Just as she was about to rush out of the door through the fire, she stumbled over the threshold and the kerosene completely spilled, causing the mother and daughter to be tragically burned to death. Later, Wuda and his son learned about the situation and went inside to put out the fire, which was extinguished, preventing the houses, beds, trunks, and other items from being damaged, which was very fortunate.</p>

<p>Two People Escape from Yangcheng Lake Kidnapping Case: On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, Zhao Yongkang from Kunshan, Wu Jinru and Xu Yulin from the county, and others came to Changshu from Kunshan. Later, as the scheduled boat had already left, they hired a private boat to return to Changshu. Unexpectedly, while traveling through the Kunshan-Changshu border area of Yangcheng Lake, they encountered a bandit boat that kidnapped Wu and the other three. Now, Wu Jinru and Zhao Yongkang have been released by the bandits. The fate of Xu Yulin is unknown. According to Wu and others, three days after being kidnapped, the bandits suddenly took Xu Yulin away, and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>

<p>Dismissal of Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Dun: Chen Dun, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, has been in office for half a year since taking over on February 18th of this year. Previously, he ordered Xiao Jiaxian and Chen Fusheng, the section members in the bureau, to go to Beiwai to investigate the smoke case of Jiang Benli and Huang Zuyin, and privately accepted bribes and released them. The county presented Chen Dun to the department and he was given a major demerit. On the 21st, the Provincial Government's 427th meeting proposed by Hu, the Director of Civil Affairs, dismissed Chen Dun, the chief of the Jiangyin Public Security Bureau, and transferred Jiang Guangdian, the chief of the Huaian Public Security Bureau, to fill the vacancy. Unexpectedly, Zhao Zongtian, Zhu Yuanzhang, and others telegraphed Liu Shaokang and other provincial representatives, requesting the Department of Civil Affairs to transfer Yin Xiongfei, the chief of the county police team, to fill the position, preventing Jiang Guangdian from coming to Cheng. It is unknown whether the Department of Civil Affairs will approve it.</p>
<p>Conclusion of Debate on Reactionary Case: Xing Songwen, the former district chief of the first district, Xu Yan, the district assistant, Zhou Qiujiang, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and Xu Laowu, a resident of Dongwai, and others, were arrested last September for suspicion of committing reactionary crimes and taken to the High Court for interrogation. Because the Anti-Revolutionary Law was abolished and the Emergency Law for Punishing the People of the Republic of China was newly enacted, the county magistrate served as the presiding judge and organized a special court to interrogate them. Xing and others have been returned to Jiangyin for several months. The High Court appointed Pan Jiadian, a judge from Jingjiang, to conduct a joint trial. On the 22nd, Judge Pan came to Cheng and conducted a joint trial with County Magistrate Peng and Judge Wu. Xing Songwen, Zhou Qiujiang, and Xu Laowu all denied having any reactionary relationship. Xu Yan confessed that although he was forced to join in Wuhan in the second half of the 16th year of the Republic of China, he completely believed in the principles of the party during the purge in the 17th year of the Republic of China, and presented several pieces of evidence and worked hard on revolutionary facts. After the interrogation, County Magistrate Peng announced that the debate on the case was concluded today and that the judgment would be delivered in a week. In court, Xing Songwen and Xu Yan requested that they be allowed to be treated at Renji Hospital because they were both ill, and that two shops be guaranteed, and that the bailiffs be sent to guard Xu Laowu and return him to the school. The judgment in the case of smoking by the directors of the school: Xiang Yinghua and other alumni of Nanqing High School reported that Wang Xiyu, a director of the school, was smoking opium. On the afternoon of the 22nd, County Magistrate Peng interrogated Wang, who admitted to smoking and was sentenced to a fine of 150 yuan and four months in prison, suspended for two years.</p>
<p>Two Kidnapping Cases: Gu Yinzhizi Hanxiang, a farmer in Nanqiu Township, District 6, which borders Wujin and Kunlian, was kidnapped by more than ten bandits from Lata Dam, Qinxiang Township, Wujin on the night of the 13th, and the next day they demanded 3,000 yuan for his ransom. His father agreed to Yang 900 yuan and was negotiating the ransom ticket. The day before yesterday, a bandit named Huang Yaoting was captured in Taohua Bay, Wujin, and taken to the county for questioning. He confessed his feelings. The Wujin side sent a team to arrest him. When the bandits heard the news, they shot and killed Gu Hanxiang. Yesterday (the 23rd), Cao, the district chief, reported to the county and transferred it to Wujin to strictly arrest the murderer. In the case of Guo Zhengjian's family in Laohai Dam, Changyinsha, District 4, the house was rented to Wuxi Guangqin Yarn Factory as a flower collection point. The day before yesterday (the 22nd), a bandit boat arrived at midnight with more than forty bandits, who kidnapped Guo Zhengjian and his wife, their 11-year-old son, and their daughter, four people in total. On the 23rd, they reported to the county and asked for help to rescue them.</p>

<p>Investigation and Reporting of Floods in the Whole County: The flood in Tongyi this year was investigated by the county government, which sent people to investigate the roads. The area east of Jinsha is the most serious. Now that the flood has receded, the total amount of barren land accounts for more than 50%. The remaining amount is abundant and the average harvest can be 60% of the normal year. The total statistics show that the autumn harvest is expected to be only 30-40%, which has been reported to the provincial hall.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Forests and Water Conservancy (Li Yingong) <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>There are many recent events that can be used as evidence to prove the importance of afforestation and flood prevention. Yu the Great's success in controlling the floods relied on the ancient trees that covered the sky and the living things that filled the earth at that time. The torrential rain that fell was immediately reduced by half, and the situation was quickly brought under control. It was not like the later generations who only opened up agricultural land, resulting in a reduction in the area of wild forests and bushes, and it is no wonder that floods occurred frequently and were constantly recorded in history. The southern region of France is mostly mountainous. At first, at the beginning of the 19th century, the area of mixed pasture forests and indiscriminate logging expanded year by year. As a result, mountain floods broke out and quicksand spread throughout the country, causing great harm. Since 1841, the engineer Shuhe published a plan for "Fundamentally Treating the Disease by Operating the Forest," followed by the forester Montesquieu's firm statement that to save floods, it is necessary to manage water, prevent sand, and build protective forests. The government then drafted a compulsory protective afforestation law, raising more than three million in funding annually and appointing a supervisor to complete the work within a limited time. Since then, the floods have been greatly reduced, and the southern provinces of Upper Arleber and Pu Arleber have benefited the most from the forest. Farmers not only do not object to the purchase of private land, but also request the government to add their fields to the protective forest. The human-protected forest is also a successful example of afforestation and flood prevention.</p>
<p>Forests and water conservancy have never been noticed in our country, and few people have discussed them. Although the entire territory includes the Pearl River, Yangtze River, Huai Si, Yellow River, and Heilongjiang River basins, the area in square miles lacks investigation. We should classify and grade the land's highlands (hunting grounds or parts suitable for forest cultivation), grasslands (natural forest and pasture), and lowlands (most of the agricultural land and abandoned land along the water) to classify their uses. It is rare not to feel that forests and water conservancy are interrelated everywhere. As for the utilization of Hou Sheng, it also includes the recent rainfall in the capital on July 4th and 5th, which amounted to 227.1 millimeters, which is about nine inches. As a result, it has not stopped for ten days and has become a rare disaster that occurs only once in fifty years, which makes people realize that this problem needs to be studied. Especially today, protective forests are unheard of, and it is not logical to talk about water conservancy. Usually, provinces along the river have water conservancy bureaus, and provinces along the Yellow River and the Grand Canal also have officials in charge of river engineering affairs. What exactly are their duties? It is confusing to many people. The heavy expenditure of the year is equal to the empty hen's alarm to the dam and the appropriation of funds for emergency rescue, which is enough to make people laugh. It can be seen that the general public is too indifferent to academic forest management and forest benefits. Moreover, the meaning of protective forests is very broad, and water management only accounts for one of its effects. Wind prevention, sand prevention, tsunami prevention, etc., are all based on the needs of local conditions, and the operating procedures are changed accordingly, which cannot be adhered to one set of rules. However, not lightly harvesting and only selective logging are its common principles. The branches and leaves of the trees fall under the forest to provide fertilizer and improve the soil's power. During the rainy season, they help the roots to retain the rapid torrents. In peacetime, they complete the function of conserving water resources. It is also the same. Therefore, firewood is absolutely prohibited in all forestry. In the countryside of our country, there is a great lack of fuel. Banning firewood in forest areas is considered a great rebellion in the environment. Protective benefits are great, and banning firewood is small. How can they know? Therefore, without laws and regulations to force the gentry to publicize, there is no one day to enter the right track.</p>
<p>In other countries, hydraulic engineers can often set up independent schemes and create plans that are not surprising. Only our great rivers and plains have a clear situation. Taking the Yangtze River as an example, the mountains in the upper reaches are connected to each other, and nine out of ten of them are bald. So far, there is still no strong public order to afforest them. On both sides of the river, people do not automatically plant trees to protect the embankment. Mountain rain washes away, and sediment accumulates on the bottom of the river every year. Once the water rises, there is no fear of the dam collapsing and flooding the fields. Therefore, in the past, the country only felt a shortage of wood, such as the market being filled with American Douglas fir, California cypress, Japanese spruce, Japanese elm, oak, Philippine white lauan, red lauan, Philippine apitong, West Australian mahogany, Northwest Siberian mahogany, Russian red pine, etc. The outflow of rights and interests has now progressed to the problem of people and animals being flooded, which is even more related. Every few years, they want to experience it once, and the feeling may even be worse. This is inevitable and can be asserted. The forest referred to in the wooden article is different from the economic specialty of ordinary forestry. Because general forestry relies on highlands and grassland planning to transform a vast wasteland into production, diligently seeking long-term quantities and making ten times the profit, this is just to make the best use of the lowlands (based on the county) and roughly draft the following entry methods: 1. Survey and management of forest management. It is necessary to be clear about the local situation, soil properties, and depth, wind direction, wind power, and local tree species before appropriate techniques can be applied.</p>
<p>2. Survey and mapping including measuring the land, purchasing land, registering official wastelands, and preparing budgets (roughly speaking, the cost of raising seedlings and planting broad-leaved tree seedlings is twice that of coniferous trees).</p>
<p>3. The operating plan divides the annual limited planting volume based on the number of acres and establishes a management procedure to avoid interruption.</p>
<p>Attached is a discussion on the selection of trees for afforestation on embankments or lowlands. Please list them: (1) Swamp Walnut, also known as Feng Yang, belongs to the walnut family. The reason for the difference is that it is a naked species. There are seven kinds of swamp walnuts, and China occupies five of them, so the distribution is particularly far away. They can all grow in streams and wet places, like fertile soil, and have fast growth. If they are in alluvial land, they will flourish even more. The wood is similar to the linden tree, white, light, and soft, for use in utensils, and is especially suitable for making wooden clogs and book boxes. It can also be used as a carving.</p>
<p>(2) Weeping Willow, Common Willow, Qi Willow, and Stream Willow are all not afraid of water. It is very easy to propagate using cuttings, and the survival rate is the highest. Weeping Willow can also be planted by burying large camellias. The branches on both sides of the long river in the West Lake Su Causeway and the Yangzhou Ping Mountain Hall hang down, and the entrance is closed and decorated with beautiful scenery. Although it is submerged for a long time, it does not matter. The wood has value.</p>
<p>(3) White Poplar Willow, produced in Hebei, Jiangsu, Hubei, Sichuan, and other provinces. It is especially common between 4,000 and 7,000 in the Minjiang River basin in Sichuan, but it is usually scattered. The trunk is straight and very beautiful. People in the capital often call it Nanjing White Poplar. It is very easy to reproduce, and the growth rate is fast. There are many fishermen and houses planted beside Xuanwu Lake, and they are also seen mixed with lakes, which are high above the treetops and cute in green. The wood is suitable for various uses. (4) White Poplar is produced from Hebei and Shaanxi to the south to Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The tree shape is neat and beautiful, and the height and length can reach six feet. The bark is blue-white, and the old tree is dark and cracked. The leaves are triangular, with different sizes at the pointed ends, with light hair on the surface or smooth, and white on the inner side, with dense hair, so it is called White Poplar. This tree is quite difficult to live with cuttings. It is suitable to cut off the branches in winter, bury them in the cellar, dig them out in early spring, cut them into appropriate lengths, and dig trenches in the garden before inserting them. Fill with mud and then insert. After that, you must water them frequently to avoid drying. The material is excellent.</p>
<p>(5) Chinese Parasol Tree, also known as Qing Tong, is easily cultivated by seed propagation in China, and the old roots have strong re-emergence ability, but the top buds are afraid of frost, and it is less obstructive after the early years. Can survive in water-surplus soil. The ancient saying is: The Parasol Tree grows on the Autumn River, which can be played with.</p>
<p>(6) White Birch likes moist soil and can reach three or four feet in height. The skin is thin, white, and easy to peel off. There are about thirty-two kinds of Chinese products, some of which belong to small trees. The wood is white and dense and is used for appliances, and the smaller ones can be used as firewood (7) Wu Yue is produced in Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces. I have seen people in Zhejiang sparsely planting this in the lowlands along the lake, harvesting seeds to extract oil and wax, and doubling their profits. After the by-products are taken, the slag can be used as fertilizer, which is also a good fertilizer. When the tree is old, it will bear fruit and can produce more seeds. The newly reclaimed low-lying land along the Jiujiang River in Dongliuqiupu, Anhui is also very lush (8) Xiao Xuan Mu, mistakenly called French Parasol, another kind of P·OCCIDENTALIS are both ancient tree species and fossils have been found in Europe, North America, and the northern part of Asia. Suitable for all kinds of wind and soil, can withstand coal smoke, and is not afraid of alkaline soil. Propagation generally uses cuttings. The branches with reddish color have a higher survival rate. After many experiments by the world, it is generally believed that it is a tree of lowlands and water. The wood is quite like beech, with rich texture and color, and the effect is not limited to one way.</p>
<p>In addition, you can add water-loving trees in each county as appropriate. Use GROUPSYSTEM for experimentation, and write down their growth status separately to serve as a standard for future preservation or elimination. After several years, expand the scope of operations to determine the operating plan. If the counties follow it earnestly and the general hub of forestry administration supervises it, then water conservancy may be possible. In addition, this year's flood should be recognized by the people of the country as a result of deforestation. They can use labor relief or military labor to mobilize the group to do their best to address the urgent task of afforestation and flood prevention, so Yingong's draft of this article is not false.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, Recently, I read a report in the local communication Hangzhou Communication column of your newspaper on the 17th of this month, which stated that the station master was dismissed for a gambling case at the station. This is not in line with the facts. It has been found that Lai Chen and the other two were arrested for suspicion of gambling outside. The station master temporarily guaranteed them. They were transferred to the Hangzhou Land Court for interrogation the day before yesterday. The interrogation revealed that the station master was not involved and was not summoned. If he had been gambling with them at the time, how could he have been a guarantor? Therefore, whether it is extremely obvious. As for the Road Bureau ordering Li to be dismissed and deducting three months' salary as a warning, it is even more unfounded. The station master is still working in Lin and there is no such bureau order. I do not know what the visiting reporter based his statement on, which is of great importance to his reputation. I am specially writing to request a correction to clarify the truth. Education News</p>

<h3 id="e91">Record of the 16th Annual Meeting of the China Science Society (2) <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The 16th annual meeting of the China Science Society was held in Zhenjiang. The situation of the opening ceremony on the first day was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the situation on the 23rd will be recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Taking a boat to Jiaoshan</p>
<p>After the banquet held by the provincial government at Pinfang on the evening of the 22nd, some members returned to the mountain by boat, while the rest went to the Dahua Hotel by the river. After breakfast at 8 a.m. on the 23rd, they went to the car ferry pier and took a small steamer to Jiaoshan. Although the weather on land was sultry and hot that day, after the anchor was raised, the waves were calm and the wind blew across the water, making it cool and pleasant. After a short boat trip, this majestic green peak on the river was in sight. The group happily went ashore.</p>
<p>(2) Council Meeting</p>
<p>The council meeting was held at 9 a.m. in Zhenjiang Pavilion, chaired by Wang Jiliang. He reported on the opening of the meeting, saying briefly that it was rare to have so many members at the council meeting today. He said that he would report the following matters and leave matters such as elections for later discussion. He also read telegrams from Society members Hu Shih, Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, Zhao Yuanren, and Shu Yong from Peiping, stating that they could not attend this annual meeting and expressing their apologies. Then, the</p>
<p>Board of Directors Report (represented by Secretary-General Yang Xiaoshu) briefly stated that many things had been done in the past year, and now the most important ones were selected for a brief report: (1) The establishment of Society member associations in three locations: A, Hangzhou; B, Qingdao; C, Suzhou. Together with the original five locations in Beijing, Ping, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Shenyang, there were now eight locations. The Chongqing Society member association was still in the process of being established. (2) The completion of two new buildings: A, the Shanghai Mingfu Library; B, the Beijing Biological Research Institute; C, Initially, it was intended to hold an arts and crafts exhibition, but due to the large scale, it was not easy to organize at once, so a version exhibition was held in Shanghai. Mr. Cai contributed a lot, and many of the precious versions were borrowed by Mr. Cai privately from various sources. There were more than 100 Song editions, and many Six Dynasties editions. Yuan, Ming, and Qing editions were needless to say. In addition, famous foreign editions and precious handwritten books were also borrowed. Modern printing, such as various versions from the Commercial Press and China Bookstore, were also displayed. The exhibition lasted for six days, and more than 5,000 people attended. (3) This year, the Society admitted five permanent members, 116 ordinary members, and six associate members, for a total of 1,289 members. (The addresses of more than 850 people are unknown.) (4) Addition of irregular publications to transmit news among Society members. 345 letters were received during the year. (5) The circulation of the Science Magazine published by the Society has been increasing year by year, which shows that the public has a considerable interest in science. It is estimated that 155 copies were subscribed to in the 17th year, 422 copies in the 18th year, and 594 copies in the 19th year. In addition to the Science Magazine, 247 copies of other publications were sold in the 17th year, 351 copies in the 18th year, and 394 copies in the 19th year, which also showed considerable progress. (6) Essay award, the scope of the essay was physics and other subjects, and there were seven universities applying, etc. Then, the</p>
<p>Accounting Report (Zhou Zijing) briefly stated that the accounting revenue and expenditure had been prepared in writing and distributed to all members. (The written report was too long to be recorded.) The account was reviewed by Gu Jigao and He Zhongliu, two members publicly recommended by the Society. The total revenue was briefly stated as follows: (1) Previous balance: 12,097.71 yuan in foreign currency and 1 pound in gold. (2) Revenue for this year: 74,006.69 yuan and 16,977 taels of silver. (3) Expenditure for this year: 92,795.47 yuan in foreign currency and 16,977 taels of silver. (4) Balance: 13,308.93 yuan in foreign currency and 8 taels of silver. Then, the</p>
<p>Biological Research Institute Report (Bing Lushan) briefly stated that since last year, long-term expeditions and investigations of flora and fauna in various coastal areas have been carried out, and many kinds of flora and fauna specimens have been collected and compiled into the Institute. Last year's research papers were divided into two departments, including three articles in the botany department and ten articles in the zoology department, totaling six volumes. The most gratifying thing this year was that temporary funding was obtained from the China Cultural Foundation to build a new house. In order to seek long-term academic progress, various equipment had to be slightly prepared. The old houses for studios and specimens were no longer sufficient, so adding a house was imperative. This new building was completed at the end of this year, including a two-story building with a total of 36 rooms. The assets in the Research Institute, such as books, specimens, instruments, medicines, physiology, histology, experimental zoology, etc., were all moved to the new house. As for the research on anatomy and taxonomy, and the preparation of stripped and immersed specimens, etc., they were still in the old house. The working conditions of the animal and plant departments in the past year are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>(Animal Department) 1. Full-time staff: Bingzhi, Wang Jiaji, Wang Qinfu, Zhang Mengwen, Zhou Weicheng, Hao Shixiang, He Xirui, Jia Qinyin, Feng Zhanru, Liu Zigang, Chen Jinsheng. 2.

Collection and utilization of specimens: In June last year, staff were sent down the Yangtze River from Nanjing to Wusong to collect submerged fish and various birds along the river, led by Mr. Wang Qinfu. They went to Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Yixing, Kunshan, etc., and the obtained specimens were sent to Professor Shou Zhenfei of the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute in Peiping and Dr. Zhang Chunlin of the University of Paris for research. About 600 kinds of bird specimens were also sent to Mr. Shou. Snake specimens were provided for research by Mr. Fang Bingwen and Mr. Zhang Mengwen in the Institute. The old snake and amphibian specimens were sorted out by the two gentlemen. The fish specimens collected from Yantai were sorted out by Mr. Wang Qinfu and Mr. Wu Xianwen.

<p>The last two singles matches were indeed all won | 3 to 2 eliminated Canada</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang won three straight against Litt | Not difficult</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai won Deffau after five sets | Extremely dangerous</p>
<p>Finals against Japan start on the 28th</p>
<p>Everyone was happy. Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang lived up to expectations, winning all against the two Canadian singles players. The Chinese team won the Rotary Cup World Tennis Finals qualification. Canada initially led 2 to 1, but was eliminated by China with a score of 2 to 3. Jiang Daozhang's victory over Litt was not difficult, but Qiu Feihai's victory over Deffau was full of ups and downs and dangerous situations. More than seven hundred people watched with bated breath. Qiu Feihai's hard-fought five-set victory can be said to be fortunate. The finals against Japan are scheduled to begin on the 28th.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Jiang Daozhang Wins Litt <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>| Three straight sets very easy |</p>
<p>| Canada first lost |</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang (China) (6-4) (6-2) (6-3) Litt (Canada)</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang won three straight against Litt. The Chinese team first regained one point, tying the score. Litt was far from Jiang's opponent yesterday. The audience was very happy and gratified to see Jiang's successive victories.</p>
<p>Smooth sailing, Litt served, Jiang Daozhang had smooth sailing and won four games in a row. Litt regained three games, and Jiang won the first set 6-4. The second set started, and Jiang Daozhang still used a very powerful block and hit the corners. Although Litt was a good net player, he could not get close to the net. After 4-1, Jiang won the second set 6-2. After Jiang won two sets, the victory was set. Litt served again and won one game. Jiang then won three games in a row, winning 3-2 and then 6-3, making it three straight.</p>
<p>Good luck, Jiang performed much better than usual yesterday, very smoothly and extraordinarily. The balls he hit were just over the net, sharp and cut. Litt could only see the net. The cross-court shots were also extremely accurate. Litt could not defend the net. It was also good luck. Although, Litt's skills were not comparable to Jiang's.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Qiu Feihai Loses to Deffau <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>| Two hours of worry |</p>
<p>| Five sets to win |</p>
<p>(2-6)</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (China) (6-2) Deffau (Canada)</p>
<p>(6-3)</p>
<p>(3-6)</p>
<p>(6-4)</p>
<p>After Jiang Daozhang won against Litt, the fate of China and Canada depended on who won between Qiu Feihai and Deffau. After the Jiang-Litt match, Qiu was leading Deffau 2-1. In an instant, Deffau also regained one set, making it 2-2. In the last set, at the critical moment of life and death, General Qiu used his life, and indeed won 6-4. The Chinese team then won the finals qualification.</p>
<p>The weather changed. When Qiu and Deffau started the match, the north wind was blowing wildly and the sky was overcast. Qiu Feihai served, and lost four games in a row. Deffau went to the net to block and kill every game, guarding the pass. Seeing that blocking was sure to be killed, Qiu tried to hit a high ball to get over it, but the close shots touched the net, and the high balls went out of bounds, and he was at a loss. 4-1, 5-2, and lost 2-6. The audience was shocked to see this situation. The weather also changed, with drizzling rain and wind all over the field.</p>
<p>Sudden turning point. At the start of the second set Qiu Feihai lost two more games. Qiu was lamenting his lack of luck, when the wind and rain stopped, and from then on the situation turned around. Seeing the failure of the high ball, Qiu knew that he still had to rely on fierce shots. So he ignored Deffau's net defense and shot fiercely at the corners. The ball was low and fast. Deffau raised his racket to return, but touched the net repeatedly and hit the ball out of bounds with force. Once this road was opened, Qiu Feihai's path was smooth, winning nine consecutive games. In the second set, he won six consecutive games, showing Deffau some color.</p>
<p>The hearts of the people settled. At the start of the third set Qiu won three more games, so a total of nine games. Although Qiu was fierce, when the opportunity came, he gently chopped the ball, which landed in front of the net and did not bounce up. Sometimes close, sometimes far, the skills were miraculous. Deffau recovered the score to 2-3. Qiu was 5-2, 6-3, and won the third set again. He led with a total of 2-1, and the hearts of the people were settled.</p>
<p>Loss of opportunity again. It was hoped that Qiu would win one more set, then the victory would be set. How could he know that when Deffau served, Qiu lost three games in a row. He barely picked up one game, and Deffau was in a very advantageous position again at 5-1, and won the fourth set 6-3. Qiu lost the opportunity to win again here. With the loss of this set, the score was 2-2. Everyone knew that Qiu's physical strength was weak, and they were very worried about his victory in the fifth set.</p>
<p>Go home with peace of mind. The success or failure, victory or defeat, all depended on this last set. Everyone looked at each other, very worried. Deffau served, Qiu got it, and Deffau also won one game. Then Qiu won two consecutive games, leading with 3-1, and was 60% confident, half relieved. At 5-3, Deffau served, Deffau suddenly attacked from left and right, recovering the score to 5-4. The worry came again. If it became 5-5, there would be more trouble. Good luck and fortune came, Qiu won 6-4 and was overjoyed. Two hours of worry were finally over, and he went home with peace of mind.</p>

<h3 id="e100">The Second Big Wind is Coming Again <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The customs fired cannons to warn that Jianghai ships were suspended</p>
<p>For nearly a week, the local area has been scorching hot, and the mercury has often been between 96 and 97 degrees. Until the day before yesterday, the wind was calm, and the autumn sun was even more terrible. But in the morning, the wind picked up and dark clouds chased, and the weather suddenly became cooler. It is said that the hurricane in the Pacific Ocean has advanced to the East China Sea and is blowing towards the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. According to the warning from the Xujiahui Observatory at 11 a.m. yesterday, at that time the hurricane had passed Naha and was only 600 kilometers away from Shanghai, moving northwest and northwest by west, approaching the coast between Shanghai and Wenzhou. It was expected to land before this morning, but according to the observatory's forecast at 4:30 p.m., the wind direction has turned to the northwest by west, approaching the coast of Wenzhou and Taizhou. It is feared that it will still follow the previous route and blow through the Oujiang River basin, or it may not pass Shanghai. At 9 p.m. last night, a special warning was issued, saying that a very large hurricane is now slowly blowing through the East China Sea, and due to the pressure in northern China and Japan, it has turned to the northwest by west. The East China Sea and the Wusongkou to the coast of Taiwan are turbulent, and there are also cyclones.</p>
<p>The customs notified the shipping industry that at 1:30 p.m. yesterday, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs hoisted a strong wind signal and a warning black ball at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII, and immediately notified the shipping companies to order the sea ships in Shanghai that had not yet left the port to suspend sailing temporarily, so that they could stay in the Huangpu River to avoid the wind and avoid accidents. At 4:30 p.m., the Pudong flag station also hoisted a black wind ball and fired a cannon to warn at the same time.</p>
<p>Near-sea ships were suspended. The location and direction of this big wind were similar to the last time, so yesterday, the Shanghai-Ningbo liners of the Taikoo and Ning Shao companies, such as the Xin Beijing, announced the suspension of sailing after receiving the customs warning. The passengers who had boarded the ship纷纷 returned their tickets and went back, and changed to leave the port tomorrow. The Xin Jiangtian and Ning Xing ships, which came from Ningbo, were also telegraphed yesterday to avoid the wind in Ningbo and not to come for the time being. The Shanghai-Taiwan class, Wenzhou-Haimen class, and other near-sea routes all suspended sailing at noon yesterday and stayed in Shanghai to avoid the wind.</p>
<p>The Nan Hua liners delayed sailing. The local shipping companies, punished by the danger of encountering the wind last time, are now extra cautious. The Taikoo Nan Hua liners, such as the Suiyang and the Nisshin Rosan Maru, have all delayed their departure time and will not sail until the wind subsides this morning. The Yangtze River ships have also postponed their departure time. If the wind does not subside this morning, they will decide not to sail.</p>
<p>Small boats in the Huangpu River avoid the wind. Since yesterday afternoon, the tide in the Huangpu River has risen sharply. The small barges and sampans on the river surface have stopped loading and unloading goods and carrying passengers across the river. In the evening, the small steamers also stopped running, and the civilian ships sailed into the Suzhou River to avoid the wind.</p>
<p>The last hurricane caused a maritime disaster. A total of four ships were wrecked in the first hurricane. Jardine Matheson had a Weisen who touched a reef and drowned one person. The rest were rescued and came to Shanghai. Then, the Guang Sheng Lun was sunk by the wind and waves, and all the passengers and employees fell into the sea. Only three people were rescued. The families of the victims have been coming to the company for days to inquire about the truth. It was not until yesterday that news came from Fuzhou, saying that the Guang Sheng Lun encountered a strong wind and the hull touched a reef. The whole ship sank in two hours. None of the passengers, crew members, and sailors on board were spared and all fell into the sea. Only one stoker, one sailor, and one cook were able to float on the sea after falling into the sea. After 36 hours, they were rescued by a fishing boat, and then boarded a wooden boat to Fuzhou. On the 24th of this month, the Jardine Matheson in Fuzhou and the British Consul sent the three people to the Wanzhou ship of the Sanbei Company and sent them back to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive on Thursday. The truth about the Guang Sheng Lun's accident and the number of deaths on the whole ship (at least it should be in the hundreds) will be clear after the three people arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e101">News from Various Sectors on Disaster Relief Yesterday <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Enthusiastic Automatic Assistance and Methods for Accommodating Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Fundraising for the Flood Disaster: News continued to come in yesterday, including condolences from friendly nations Italy and Finland, the flight to Hankou by Zhu Qinglan and Zha Liangzhao, the resolution of accommodation methods, and the enthusiastic fundraising from all sectors. These are particularly important. Details are provided below:</p>
<p>Condolences from Italy and Finland Regarding the Flood Disaster in Our Country</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai office of the Italian Embassy, all sectors of the Italian government and public, upon learning of the severe flooding in various parts of our country, expressed deep sorrow. On the previous day, Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, representing all sectors of the nation, sent a telegram to Italian Chargé d'Affaires in China, Cianno, instructing him to forward condolences to Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government for all disaster areas in China. The original telegram was in Italian and was translated into Chinese yesterday (24th) by the Italian Chargé d'Affaires and forwarded to Chairman Zhuang of the Nanjing National Government to express condolences. The original telegram was translated into Chinese by Mr. Zhou Shuqing, secretary of the embassy, as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government of the Republic of China in Nanjing: Heaven has not blessed our friendly nation, which has suffered a terrible flood. The most prosperous provinces have become a watery expanse, with countless disaster victims everywhere. The alarming news has caused deep pain among government and public in our country. Therefore, the entire Fascist Italy extends its condolences to the people of our friendly nation. Please accept our sincere sympathies. Mussolini, Prime Minister of Italy, bows in respect." In addition, Finnish Chargé d'Affaires to China, Norlin, also recently received a telegram of condolence from the Finnish government to the National Government regarding the flood disaster. Mr. Norlin sealed the telegram in an envelope and personally delivered it to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Fenglin Bridge for forwarding to the National Government.</p>
<p>Relief Committee Discusses American Wheat Issue</p>
<p>The Finance Group of the National Flood Relief Committee met yesterday to discuss the telegram from the U.S. Department of Agriculture regarding the sale of wheat on credit. It is reported that further negotiations are needed with the Department regarding the repayment period and interest rates to obtain more favorable terms.</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan and Others Scheduled to Fly to Hankou This Morning</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, and Standing Committee member Qinglan, along with Zha Liangzhao and others from the North China Charity Federation, went to Song Ziwen's residence on Rue Bisson in the French Concession at 9 a.m. yesterday to discuss emergency relief measures for about an hour. Because of the severity of the disaster in various areas, Mr. Zhu believed that an on-site inspection was necessary to determine emergency relief measures. It was therefore decided that Mr. Zhu and Mr. Zha would take a flight to Hankou. The National Flood Relief Committee of the National Government will purchase airline tickets from China National Aviation Corporation for them. They are scheduled to depart from Longhua by plane at 7 a.m. today to inspect the situation along the way and plan to return to Shanghai by plane within two or three days. After investigating the disaster situation in various areas, they will begin to implement emergency relief measures.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Discussed Accommodation Measures Yesterday</p>
<p>Since receiving the order to plan for the accommodation of disaster victims, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau immediately began to work. At 10 a.m. yesterday, letters were sent to the Public Safety and Health Bureaus and representatives of various organizations to discuss the matter. Those who attended included Director Hu of the Health Bureau and representatives of various organizations such as Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Binyan, Ye Huijun, Wu Weide, and Xi Guansheng, totaling more than 30 people. Director Pan Gongzhan of the Social Affairs Bureau presided over the meeting and reported on the importance the municipal government attached to the flood disaster and the reason for convening the meeting. Director Hu then reported on the results of informal talks with the concessions, who were willing to do their utmost to assist. (1) It was decided to establish the Shanghai Disaster Victim Accommodation Office. (2) The office will have one director and four deputy directors. Wang Yiting was publicly elected as director, and Pan Gongzhan, Chen Xizeng, Hu Hongji, and Ye Huijun were elected as deputy directors. Five sections will be established: general affairs, supplies, health, security, and repatriation. Except for the security and health sections, which will be handled by personnel from the Public Safety and Health Bureaus, the remaining sections will be handled by the director and deputy directors. An office will be established in a convenient location. (3) The Disaster Relief Committee will send telegrams to the municipal governments of various provinces, instructing them to intercept and accommodate disaster victims who come down, with Shanghai only acting as a last resort. (4) Accommodation in this city will be based on the principle of centralization. If a large number of disaster victims arrive, it is planned to build houses on the vacant land of the Zhoujiazui Junpu Bureau for accommodation. The disaster victims currently arriving will be temporarily accommodated at the Chaozhou Villa in Nanshi and the gruel kitchen in Zhabei. (5) In addition to the funds allocated by the municipal government, assistance will be provided by various agencies, and no external donations will be solicited. (6) Feng Liutang, Shen Gao, and Jin Zhongjian were asked to draft the office's constitution. (7) Before the office's premises are determined, the Social Affairs Bureau will temporarily serve as the liaison office.</p>
<p>A Heartrending Telegram from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Hubei Native Place Association in Shanghai's Emergency Relief Committee for the Flood Disaster in Hubei Province received a telegram from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, which stated: "We believe that Hubei Province is the most severely affected by this great flood, and Wuhan is the most tragic. A prehistoric scene has reappeared, and a great calamity is at hand. The autumn waters stretch across the sky, and the disaster is not yet over. Because Hubei is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, with the most lakes, it has always been known as a watery area. Wuchang and Xiaokou are at the confluence of the Han River. Therefore, there are floods every year, that is, floods every year. Since the beginning of summer this year, there have been continuous heavy rains, pouring down without stopping. Mountain floods have erupted, and canals and ponds have turned into turbid currents. On flat ground, wind and waves have accumulated into huge floods. The Guangyong River in Han and the Wu Gorge in Sichuan have waters ten feet high, flowing in the same direction. The counties along the river and lakes, which have always relied on embankments to protect their lives, number more than forty. The rushing currents have breached everything. Stone houses have boats on their roofs, and there is no way to travel on land. The dead are carried away by the currents, and no one asks about the fields. The living are like ants gathered on sandbars, in isolated circumstances. Alarming news is constantly being reported, which breaks the hearts of those who hear it. At this time, the members of our association, striving to follow the example of gentlemen from all walks of life, are organizing emergency relief and reinforcing river defenses, reducing food and clothing, hoping to be of some help. Unexpectedly, the surging forces are unstoppable. The Fenjinlu, Danshui Pond, and Dandongmen embankments, which the city of Hankou relied on for protection, have collapsed one after another, drowning countless people. Half of the wealth and property have been given to the floods. The depth is several feet in some places and several feet in others. There is water everywhere but no city life. There are boatmen but no pedestrians. All opportunities for life have been cut off. As for emergency relief, there are hundreds of thousands of disaster victims, and more than a hundred shelters are being relocated three times a day. As for disaster relief, all officials are disaster officials, and all people are disaster people. Disaster officials are saving disaster people, and the survivors are saving the dying. We dare not shirk our responsibility for surviving, but our efforts are like a cup of water trying to put out a cartload of burning wood, and our voices are hoarse and our strength is exhausted. The central government, mindful of the people's suffering, has recently allocated 170,000 yuan for relief. However, the total number of disaster victims in Hubei Province is nearly ten million. The daily cost of one meal of gruel per person is not cheap. Those waiting to be fed are crying out, 'We are hungry!' Moreover, Wuchang is following in Hankou's footsteps. There is no clean land to be seen. Alas, our children and grandchildren are facing endless calamities, burying themselves in mounds of earth, living as neighbors with ghosts, sleeping in the open air, exposed to wind and rain, suffering from hunger and cold. How can one reason with Heaven when life has reached this point? It is impossible for Zheng Xia's 'Refugee Pictures' to describe even one ten-thousandth of this situation. People call out to Heaven in times of urgent need, because Heaven has the virtue of cherishing life. People call out to their parents when they are sick, because parents have the sincerity of protecting their children. You gentlemen are either in charge of national affairs, or suppressing chaos and saving the people, or concerned about your hometowns, or helping each other in the same boat. We hope that you will show concern for the suffering of one person and give millions more bushels of unhusked rice. It is righteous to give what you have, not a favor. Carry rice and distribute it around. Do not complain about the labor of carts. Open granaries and provide relief. Do not wait to be punished in the capital. Contributing generously depends on benevolent people. Completing a fur coat depends on collecting from armpits. Saving one life is recognized by snakes and birds. Saving suffering in the three realms is jointly estimated by the gods. This is the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of the ten million disaster victims who are on the verge of death, bowing a hundred times and calling out to Heaven and their parents, seeking immediate help from you gentlemen. The telegram is urgent and full of grief. Hankou Chamber of Commerce bows in respect."</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Flood Disaster Relief Association has been working hard these days. It has been reported in this newspaper that the association has already issued donation books and is actively soliciting donations. The situation on the previous day is detailed below:</p>
<p>Replacing the Disaster Survey Specialist Qiao Baoyuan, the disaster survey specialist for 14 counties in Ning and Xu, returned to the Zhenjiang Christian Hospital for treatment due to illness. The association has now replaced him with Hua Xizeng to continue the survey.</p>
<p>Cao Songqiao Arrives in Shanghai Cao Songqiao, the director of investigation and distribution of the association, is a great philanthropist from Suzhou. After receiving a telegram on the 22nd, he came to Shanghai to take care of everything and met with Zhu Qinglan. He then returned to Suzhou.</p>
<p>Ordering Cotton Clothes The association believes that the disaster area is too wide and that winter relief is particularly important. It was decided to publicly invite Cao Songqiao and others to order 10,000 cotton trousers in the Suzhou and Shanghai area for future relief needs.</p>
<p>Donating Salaries for Relief Dai Buxiang, manager of the Great China Hotel in this city, and all employees voluntarily donated 437 yuan in salaries, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Disaster Reports from Various Counties (1) Jiangpu County: Since July, the county has experienced continuous heavy rains and floods. The floodwaters have not been able to be discharged, and the floodwaters from Huangshan in Quanjiao, Anhui, have passed through, causing the external waters to merge with the waters of this place, swelling and flowing horizontally, breaching more than ten dikes in the north and south districts. The remaining dikes along the river have burst, and the river tides have joined, causing water damage. The crops have rotted, and there is no hope of an autumn harvest. Most of the residents are in the water, and deaths have occurred one after another. The survivors have no place to live and no food to eat. Women are crying and children are weeping, and the scene is tragic. (2) Xinghua County: The county is surrounded by lakes and marshes and is originally a water town. This summer, continuous rain has caused disaster, and the river water has flowed horizontally, causing many dike banks in the countryside to collapse. The water in the city is extremely deep, reaching the chest. Since the opening of the Guanhai Three Dams, the entire county has become a watery expanse, and there is no hope of an autumn harvest. Wailing is heard everywhere, and the sight is distressing. The Dafeng and Yuhua dikes are obstructing the waterway and cannot flow smoothly into the sea, which is particularly worrying. It is now reported that gentry in Liuzhuang have telegraphed to request the opening of the Sanmaoyou River to discharge water to save the people's lives. (3) Bao Ying County: The county is located at the intersection of Xiang County and is low-lying, so it is always prone to flooding. A few months ago, there were continuous heavy rains, and the rivers and lakes rose together. The dikes in the west of the river have all collapsed, creating a vast expanse of water. The crops have been submerged, and people and animals have been washed away. The water level of the canal is higher than the people's houses, and the lakes and rivers are connected. Even with the addition of dikes, the water level is still rising and is in danger. Disaster victims have gathered here, from Huailou Bay in the south to Huangpu in the north, huddled together on mats and quilts, barely able to find space. (4) Gaoyou County: The county has suffered from drought for many years, and its vitality has been damaged. Since the beginning of summer, there has been excessive rainfall, and the Huai River has overflowed, causing the lake water to rise sharply. The dikes in the west of the lake have broken early, and the dikes in the east of the lake are also in danger. There are leaks in the gates everywhere. Therefore, the ditches in the lower reaches have long been full, and with the addition of the lake roaring and the three dams opening at the same time, a vast expanse of water has been created. The crops have been submerged, and the houses have been swept away. The young and strong are standing on the treetops, and the cries for help are louder than the morning market. The cries shake the sky, and it is heartbreaking to hear. (5) Huai'an County: The county has suffered from disasters for the past three years. This summer, there has been continuous rainfall, and the Huai River has risen sharply. The banks of the city river were the first to be flooded. The areas around Xunhe in the west of the county and the fields in the sixth and seventh fang and half of the fifth fang and half of the area have all been submerged one after another, creating a vast expanse of water with only the tops of trees showing. Many houses have been submerged, and tens of thousands of disaster victims are crying out to the heavens. They are now living on the Honghu Dam, the Wanji River Dam, and the Xinhe River Dams, waiting to be fed, and the situation is very dangerous. (6) Tongshan County: The county is adjacent to the coast, and the people are mostly poor and work hard all year round, with little savings. Last month, the rain did not stop, and the water from the sky poured down, flooding both inside and outside the city, with the water reaching the chest in some places and the knees in others. The water level in the old Yellow River outside the northeast city has increased sharply, and the bridges have collapsed. The river dikes have been in disrepair for many years, and the water is about to pour in, causing panic. The poor families along the roads have lost their shacks and barely saved their lives, sleeping in the open air, exposed to wind and rain, which is very pitiful.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Matters to be Handled by the Overseas Chinese Relief Association <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>

The draft of a telegraph in foreign languages to overseas Chinese begging for relief for the flood disaster in various provinces of the country was read out and unanimously passed. (2) Invite members. The Chinese managers of various banks on the Bund are invited to be members to help with fundraising. Song Hanzhang, Yan Chengde, Jing Runshi, and Zhu Yinjiang were nominated and will be asked to help. After contact is made, letters will be sent to ask the members to attend the meeting, which should be conducted in accordance with the previous Zhejiang disaster fundraising conference. (3) Find ways to raise funds. The fundraising method should be discussed by the general secretary with the Public Works Bureau to see if it is possible to hold a large street fundraiser. (4) Carry out emergency relief. Gu Yansheng and Zhu Yinjiang proposed and seconded that the general secretary of Suzhou should contact the emergency relief measures for northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu. (5) Newsreel.

<h3 id="e108">Jisheng Association Handles Emergency Relief in Wuhan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association and the Shanghai Flood Disaster Relief Association of Various Provinces publicly nominated Zhu Qichen, a standing committee member of the Jisheng Association, to take the Fengyang Maru steamship with experienced relief workers on the 22nd, carrying relief funds and 10,000 bags of flour, including 5,000 bags from Wang Junwei of the Lianyi Charity Association, and tens of thousands of bottles of relief medicine to Wuhan to investigate and provide emergency relief. Several methods for handling the disaster-stricken areas in Wuhan were also proposed. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>General Principles Military and police protection, sealing the barges, providing workers with food every day, building sheds in Hanyang Guishan Black Mountain as shelters, each shed accommodating about 100 people, building sheds in Wuchang Snake Mountain Hongshan as shelters, each shed accommodating about 100 people, setting up temporary medical rooms in the health department, which will be handled by the director of the medical department, preparing a large ship as the headquarters for the relief workers, with a temporary clinic attached, and another ship for storing relief grain and necessary items, beverages, coal, etc., and another ship specifically for transporting refugees from downstream ports to Shanghai and back to the disaster area. The above ships can be added, and the support of doctors and medicines on board should be borne by the director of the medical department. The directors of each port barge are responsible for loading refugees, such as unloading or needing to load items, and should contact them in advance. (Temporary Rescue Methods) (1) Organize rescue barges, with ten in each group, numbered and marked with flags during the day and mast lights at night to make it easier for refugees to identify them. (2) Each group is divided into districts for rescue. (3) Rescue disaster victims gathered on high embankments. Due to the large number of people and the variety of categories, there must be competition and risks to the rescue work. Therefore, each boat must have armed military police to announce to the refugees that a certain barge can only accommodate a certain number of people, and several people are elected from the disaster victims to help greet them. The refugees board the boat in order and cross to Hanyang as the first step. After the Hanyang shelter is full, they are transported to Wuchang. Wuchang has a wider river surface, which takes too long. Therefore, they first go to Hanyang, which is closer, so that more people can be rescued. If there are bad people who deliberately disrupt the work, they should be stopped with police force. (4) Patrol rescue teams are specialized in rescuing refugees trapped in houses by water. Ask them how many people want to go to the shelter or which port they want to go to downstream, and let them do as they please, and the team will transport them. If the person does not want to leave the house, they should be shown the advantages and disadvantages. If they still do not want to leave, they should be given the necessary items. (5) It is easier to help refugees who want to be given a few yuan or some dry food to make a living on their own. (6) Use clean drinking water groups to provide the water needed in the shelter and the drinking water for the refugees in the houses. (General Affairs Section) To lead the entire department, it is divided into a director of general affairs, a secretary, a clerk, an accountant, a liaison officer, a receiver, a dispatcher, and miscellaneous staff, as well as all kinds of miscellaneous affairs. (Shipping Department) The shipping department is divided into a director, who is responsible for the arrival and departure of ships in Hankou and the distribution of barges, and is ordered by the General Affairs Department. (Rescue Department) The rescue department is divided into a director and several rescuers. The required ships or swift ships and military police are all contacted by the General Affairs Department and issued by the Shipping Department. (Accommodation Department) The accommodation department is divided into a director, a manager, a register of disaster victims, and a miscellaneous staff. What is needed is issued by the General Affairs Department and taken from each department, registered, and reported. (Medical Department) The medical department is divided into a director, a doctor, a pharmacist, and a relief worker, who are responsible for temporary hospital duties, inspecting the bodies of the refugees in the shelter to see if they are complete, and transporting them downstream. A doctor and medicine should be sent with the ship to be distributed. (Relief Department) The relief department is divided into a director and a relief worker who are responsible for distributing the food needed by the disaster victims in the disaster area and the food and clothing needed in the shelter. How much relief supplies are needed every day? The director will calculate the approximate amount a day in advance and take it from the relief supplies management department. (Relief Supplies Management and Transportation Department) There is a director in charge of extracting and issuing the arrival of relief supplies in Hankou and registering them. (Economic Department) There is a director in charge of the money. The General Affairs Department will pay it according to the payment slip. If it is affiliated to a relief organization, there will be an economic officer in charge, and it is not included in this list. (Compilation Department) A director is responsible for compiling the disaster situation and the rescue process to commemorate it and show credibility. The above organization and management are complex and different. It is necessary to go to Wuhan to negotiate with the local charitable organizations to work together. Employees are obliged to temporarily agree on the method of requesting various companies to send the train or the small wheel back to the refugees for free or by subsidizing the expenses, and the situation must be reviewed and handled on the spot. The disaster areas in Hanyang, Wuchang, Xujiapeng, Yingzhou, Baishazhou, Liujiamiao, Danshui Pond, etc. must also be inspected on the spot to determine the relief policy.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Ning Shao Emergency Relief Association Held Committee Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>

Over two hundred coffins were about to drift away and could not be salvaged. It pleaded that the local Siming Guild quickly find a way to rescue and return them to their hometown. [Signed] Hankou Guild.

<h3 id="e110">Yangzhou Fellow-Villagers Association Emergency Meeting <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow-Villagers Association of Shanghai convened an emergency meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. More than forty people attended, and Chairman Shen Dingchen was publicly elected to preside. He reported on the disastrous flooding situation in the eight counties of Yangzhou.

<p>Fan Chang, located upstream of Wuhu, borders the river and has many polder fields. In recent years, it has suffered from repeated banditry, and the people are destitute. This year, it has suffered from a major flood, and all the dikes in the four rural areas have been almost completely washed away. It is estimated that over 190,000 acres of farmland have been flooded, and the disaster has affected over 200,000 people. They are emaciated and miserable. The disaster is unusually severe and unprecedented in a century. Although a flood relief committee has been organized by various sectors to solicit donations, the disaster area is too large and difficult to provide universal relief. Mr. Xu Yangwo was sent to Shanghai to appeal to the Anhui Flood Relief Association of Shanghai, the China International Famine Relief Commission, the Shanghai Fund-Raising Committee for Emergency Relief in Various Provinces, the Shanghai Jisheng Society, the National Government Flood Emergency Relief Committee, the National Red Cross Society, and various charitable organizations, working tirelessly and enduring great hardships.</p>

<p>To Build Buddhist Temples in Europe</p>
<p>The Da Mei Wan Bao [Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury] reports that Englishman Lincoln, Dharma name Chao Gong, a monk who has converted to Buddhism, arrived in Shanghai from the north and announced the purpose of his trip yesterday. He said he will go to Europe to promote Buddhism. If many people convert, he plans to raise funds in continental Europe to build Buddhist temples, hoping to transform the people with the true meaning of the Buddha's teachings. As for the rumor from Tianjin that he had disagreements with the monks of a certain temple in the north, it is completely untrue. All the Chinese monks and lay Buddhists he has met in his life have been kind, amiable, and loving like brothers. If he cannot fulfill his wishes on this trip to Europe, he will still live in seclusion and practice true cultivation, as Europeans seem to be preparing to brew war again, so it may not be time to promote Buddhist transformation yet.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Record of the Trial of Zhao Weixian, the Criminal in the Wei Tingrong Kidnapping Case <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Presented a Letter of Appointment Requesting Bail, Which Was Not Approved</p>
<p>On the morning of July 24, 1929, at 10:50 AM, Wei Tingrong, manager of the Sino-French Bank and commander of the Chinese Volunteer Corps in the former French Concession, was traveling with his children in his own car to return home from the Sino-French Bank, which was parked on Zhu Bao San Road, when he was kidnapped. The car was driven to Xinkaihe, where the children and the driver were forced out of the car. The kidnappers drove the car, using sedatives on Wei, who passed out. The car went to Dongjiadu and he was taken by boat to the countryside in Nanhui, Pudong. He was imprisoned and extorted for 180,000 yuan for ransom to be negotiated in Hangzhou. Two months later, several kidnappers were arrested by the French police. After questioning, the French Public Concession sentenced them to imprisonment. Now, the special investigation department of the French police has arrested Cai Weicai (from Nanhui, Pudong) and Lv Mingwang (from Shaoxing). According to Lv and others, the case was masterminded by Wei's brother-in-law, Zhao Weixian. Cai and Lv were interrogated and detained by the Second Special District Court. Colleagues from the detective agency went to 3 Fuxing Bridge in Xumen, Suzhou, and arrested Zhao. He was transferred to Shanghai the day before yesterday and detained in the French police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Special Court for questioning. Zhao was wearing a white wool western suit, a monk's hairstyle, a gray straw hat, and leather shoes, looking energetic and calm. Judge Luo, accompanied by Prosecutor Ding Shikui, opened the court for interrogation. Feixi Zhen, a lawyer from the police station, explained the case and requested a postponement to be jointly tried with the arrested defendants. During the interrogation, Zhao Weixian confessed that he was 31 years old, from Chenzhou, Hunan, and is currently the commander of the Sixth Independent Battalion of the Water Police of the Ministry of Finance. The troops are stationed in Bengbu to protect the road. He was arrested while taking leave to return to Suzhou to visit relatives and friends. He knew nothing about Wei Tingrong's kidnapping and hired a lawyer to defend him. He presented the letters of appointment and photos of his previous and current positions as evidence. Judge Luo ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing for the morning of the 28th of this month. After the order, the defendant's lawyer requested to allow the defendant to be released on bail. The court refused because the case was serious.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Murder for Property <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The case occurred in Nanhui, but the death occurred in Shanghai</p>
<p>Qiu, a woman from Nanhui County, Pudong, who was 40 years old and ran a shoe store, adopted Mei as her husband. Qiu also had an older sister and a younger brother. Recently, Mei wanted to change Qiu's property deeds to the Mei surname, but Qiu refused. As a result, Mei harbored resentment and suddenly became murderous. On the evening of the 13th of this month, around 3:00 AM, Mei inserted an iron bar about several inches long and as thick as a little finger into Qiu's vagina and uterus, about two inches deep. Qiu fainted from the extreme pain. Later, family members discovered it and treated her at a local hospital, and reported to the local Public Security Bureau to arrest Mei. On the 18th, she was transferred to the Xiaoshadu Road Labor Hospital in Shanghai for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died on the 22nd due to serious injuries. The hospital reported to the Putuo Road police station, and ordered Chinese detectives to investigate. They then moved the body to the Ferry Road coroner's office. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Liu Chun, arrived at the office to examine the body. According to Zhang Qiu, the deceased was my sister. I live in Shanghai, so I did not witness the situation at the time. However, my brother-in-law also tried to stab my sister to death with a knife last year, but it did not happen. I have already reported Mei to the Public Security Bureau under the jurisdiction of Nanhui County, Pudong. Mr. Guo then ordered that the deceased Mei Qiu was indeed injured and died before her death. The body was handed over to Zhang Qiu to collect and coffin the body with a written guarantee.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Hua Shang Electric Company Worker Yang He Shang Dies Tragically from Electric Shock <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Company Has Provided Generous Compensation</p>
<p>Yang Heshang, a worker at the Hua Shang Electric Company, died from electric shock at 10:30 yesterday morning while repairing the No. 24 square compartment (i.e., the pressure receiving station). The details are as follows: Yang Heshang was 34 years old, from Wuxi, and has been working for the company for more than ten years. He usually worked very diligently. He married a woman named Zhang and had a son who is currently four years old. He lived in the worker dormitory of the Hua Shang Electric Company on Guohuo Road. Except for rest, he went to work at the company every day. Yesterday morning, the company received a report that the power line between Longhua and Xujiahui was damaged, and immediately sent foreman Ye Bingzhang and worker Yang Heshang to investigate and repair it. At around 10:00 AM, he went to find the damaged wire in the No. 24 square compartment of the west fort on Longhua Road and opened the power gate of the compartment. The over-motor for the 5,500-pound volt power supply was placed there. Because the power was sufficient, Yang Heshang was sucked in by the power when he pulled the power gate switch, and he fell to the ground after being electrocuted. Foreman Ye Bingzhang saw the worker being electrocuted and falling to the ground, and immediately reported to the company by telephone and immediately dispatched a car to transport the worker back to the company. First, a local method was used to rescue him by moving Yang's body to a ditch filled with Yin Ni and using mud and water to extinguish the electricity on his body. Because of the excessive electricity received and the long time, a Western doctor, Wu Lizhong, was asked to inject and rescue him, but it was ineffective. He was later sent to the Southwest Hospital for treatment, but he died at around 11:00 AM. After Yang's death, the local Bao reported to the local court for an inquest. The court dispatched Prosecutor Wu to the inquest at 5:00 PM yesterday. The autopsy found that he died from electric shock. He filled out the death certificate. The funeral arrangements are scheduled for 1:00 PM today for the wake and 3:00 PM for the funeral. All the company's workers and friends took a leave of absence early to attend the funeral. After the manager of the company, Lu Bohong, learned that the worker Yang Heshang had died in the line of duty due to his long service and hard work, he was given special treatment. According to the regulations of the labor union, the company allocated about 1,000 yuan for funeral expenses, severance pay, and condolence money. It is said that there is also a special condolence and resettlement fee, which is currently being negotiated by labor and management and will be allocated once it is finalized. Yesterday, the company first allocated 50 yuan to his wife for funeral expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Joy Turns to Sorrow: A Patron Dies of Exhaustion <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Brothel Owner Secretly Replaces the Ugly Prostitute with the Dead Patron's First Choice</p>
<p>Liu Chunshan, from Yangzhou, runs a brothel at 208-209 Ziyou Lane on Wuma Road, housing five or six prostitutes. One of them, Xiao Ruyizi, picked up a stranger near Sima Road last night, a Jiangbei pimp about thirty years old. After the price was paid, they became guests in the boudoir, sharing a dream. Unexpectedly, joy turned to sorrow, and the patron died of exhaustion. The brothel owner was frightened and immediately reported to the police station. The police sent detectives to investigate and took Xiao Ruyizi to the police station. At the same time, the body was moved to the coroner's office on Ferry Road, awaiting an inquest this morning. However, according to neighbors, the prostitute who was taken away was not Xiao Ruyizi, who slept with the deceased. The brothel owner, to avoid thorough investigation, secretly replaced Xiao with Jin Xian, the ugliest prostitute, temporarily as a representative. Jin Xian was renamed Juhua, and claimed to the police that the prostitute was her own body, without a brothel owner. It is now reported that the police chief has learned the truth and will thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>

<p>Seventeen-Year-Old Woman Pimps; Twenty-Four-Year-Old Boat Hand Seeks Undue Advantage</p>
<p>Qiu Afeng, daughter of Qiu Daoxun of Xiangshan, residing in Gaojia Chang, Wusong, is twenty-two years old and of fair appearance, awaiting marriage. Around eight o'clock the night before last, a neighbor, Ji Wu's wife, went to call Afeng to play at her house. Unexpectedly, when Afeng arrived in Ji Wu's room, there was a man she did not know inside. Afeng immediately turned to leave, but Ji Wu's wife closed the door, preventing her from leaving. The man then stepped forward and embraced Afeng, attempting to violate her. Afeng, seeing this, was greatly frightened and cried out for help. At this critical moment, Afeng's younger brother happened to be passing by outside and, hearing his sister's urgent cries, quickly broke down the door and entered. The man took the opportunity to escape. Afeng and her brother then went home and told their father, Qiu Daoxun, who reported the incident to the police. Ji Wu's wife was arrested, and the man was captured in Lao's store on Dongsheng Road. Both were sent to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau. District Chief Zhao Ze Zhou interrogated them. Initially, Qiu Daoxun and Afeng recounted the events. Ji Wu's wife then stated that she was seventeen years old and from Dinghai, and that Qiu Afeng often played at her house. She claimed that her father's accusation of her being a pimp was a false accusation. The man claimed his name was Lin Ayu, twenty-four years old, from Zhenhai, working as a hand on a fishing boat. Around seven o'clock the night before last, the boat arrived at Wusong, and he went ashore, bringing old bamboo ropes from the boat to Ji Wu's house. He stated that he had thought of his cousin, Zheng Afeng, and asked Ji Wu to find her for a chat, but Ji Wu mistakenly called Qiu Afeng. Upon seeing her, he was very surprised and did not exchange a single word with Qiu Afeng. He claimed that her father's accusation of him molesting his daughter was entirely unjust. After reviewing the statements, District Chief Zhao deemed Lin Ayu and Ji Wu's wife to be extremely unlawful and, the following morning, dispatched police officers to escort them to the Public Security Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Run Over by Cart, Falls, and Dies</p>
<p>Investigation Reveals Prior Fight</p>
<p>Suspected Murderer Detained at District Office</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a fatal incident occurred at the Wuzhen Bridge embankment in Zhabei. The deceased was a child from Yancheng named Wang Chunshun, fifteen years old, who earned a living by carrying a shoulder pole and shaving heads. Around three-thirty yesterday afternoon, Wang was playing with several companions by the roadside when a cart traveling from north to south crossed the bridge. Wang suddenly fell to the ground and did not get up. A police officer stationed at the bridge arrived upon hearing the news and, upon inspection, found that the child's head was bleeding and that he had already died. Suspecting that he had been run over by the cart, the officer took the cart driver, Qi Benxiang, Zhang Xingru, and five others, along with the cart, to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau for questioning. However, after investigating the injuries on Wang Chunshun's body, the bureau determined that they did not appear to have been caused by cart wheels. Furthermore, nearby residents claimed that Wang Chunshun had been fighting with several other children and was struck, resulting in his death. The bureau chief ordered detectives to summon the suspect, Liu Pinglin, along with his older brother, Liu Kunlin, and Shi Xiaguangsheng, for preliminary interrogation and to submit a report to the court for a coroner's examination. Wang Chunshun lived at No. 198 Manzhou Road. When he fell, his left eye was bleeding, his right cheek was bruised, and his left leg was injured, suggesting blows from fists. The suspected murderer, Liu Pinglin, was of similar age and also worked as a barber. The cart's registration number was City 3066, and it was carrying wooden boards weighing approximately 800 catties.</p>

<p>Zhao Xilin, a native of Bi County who worked as an inspector at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill and the Zhonghua No. 1 Knitting Factory on Longjiang Road in Yangshupu, was shot in the kidney and leg by an enemy at 6:40 AM on the 20th of this month in front of the Shenxin factory gate.

Tao Ruisheng, Xu Sihai, Xu Axian, and three others were also injured. These details have been reported in this newspaper. The day before yesterday afternoon, Zhao Xilin's wife, Wang, learned that Qian Afu, a native of Wuxi residing at No. 3112 Yangshupu Road, was involved in the case. She reported this to the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Pang Ruiqing to secretly arrest Qian. Another Wuxi native, Qiang Ruxing, was subsequently apprehended at No. 1865 on the same road and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Station lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, stating that the two defendants were suspects and requesting interrogation. Zhao Wang also claimed that although the two defendants were not present at the scene, they knew the fugitive murderer. Under questioning, Qian Afu stated that he encountered a friend surnamed "Mou" on the No. 8 tram yesterday, who mentioned that the Zhao Xilin incident was committed by Xiao Changzhou. He added that Xiao Changzhou was his brother from the same mother, and he was shocked to hear about it but did not know the underlying cause of the conflict. He requested clarification. Qiang Ruxing claimed that his friend Tao Rongrong asked him to borrow twenty yuan in foreign currency to help Xiao Changzhou with travel expenses so he could flee elsewhere. He stated that he had nothing to do with the Zhao Xilin incident. Judge Xiao Xiefen reviewed the statements and ordered that they be remanded in custody for further investigation and interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e125">One Bandit Commits Two Abduction Cases <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Xu Zhou, a woman from Taixing residing at No. 3 Pingliang Road, had a daughter named Zhiying, only ten years old, who suddenly disappeared around 4:00 PM on the 15th of this month while playing in front of her house. She was abducted by someone. Despite entrusting others to search for her, she remained untraceable. The day before yesterday at noon, her second landlord, Qi Ganru, who sold tickets on the French Concession tram, was informed that a young girl had been abducted and was being peddled by a bandit at Wu's pancake shop at No. 110 Maidie'an Road. Upon learning this, Qi returned home and told his tenant, Xu Zhou, who then reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station. Detective Zhao Bingyue, along with Dai Jingen and Ge Yongzhen, disguised themselves as customers and went to Wu's pancake shop in the French Concession to investigate. They pretended to buy the girl, negotiated a price of forty yuan with the bandit, Xu Dishan from Jiangbei, and arrested him. They also rescued the child Zhiying and brought them back to the police station. Under interrogation, Xu confessed that he had also abducted his wife's younger sister, Li Xiuying, in his hometown on May 19th of this year. Using the pretext of introducing her to factory work, he brought her to Shanghai and sold her to Tao Laifeng, a resident of Xiaoqiaotou in the Sixteenth Ward, for sixty yuan to be his wife. Detective Zhao Hua also went to the address and brought Li Xiuying back to the police station. The police chief ordered that both girls be temporarily sent to the Women's Shelter and that Xu be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Station representative and lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the defendant had confessed to both cases at the police station and requested strict punishment. Detective Zhao, along with witnesses Dai Jingen, Ge Yongzhen, and the girl's mother, Xu Zhou, also presented their accounts of the incident. Li Xiuying stated that she was originally from the Li Family Village in Jiasi Temple, Taixing, and had been betrothed to Shen Longzi in Caozhenpu, three miles from her mother's home, and had already entered his household as a fostered daughter-in-law. In April of this year, she happened to be returning to her mother's home when she met the defendant, who was her brother-in-law. He tricked her into coming to Shanghai, claiming to recommend her for work in a factory, but she was sold to the Tao family in the Sixteenth Ward to be his wife for sixty yuan. She stated that she now wished to return to her hometown. Under questioning, the defendant admitted to both abduction cases without hesitation. Judge Xiao Xiefen sentenced Xu Dishan to three years of imprisonment as a warning. The girl Xu Zhiying was released to her mother, Xu Zhou. Li Xiuying was temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for shelter, and a letter was sent to Taixing County, instructing her family to come to Shanghai to claim her.</p>

<p>Fang Xuebao is extremely angry and accuses Jin Baifu of denying the elopement.</p>
<p>Fang Xuebao, 31 years old, from Nanjing, lives at No. 23 Wangjiazhai, Hujun Camp, Nanshi, and sells vegetables for a living. His wife, Zhou, 23 years old, from Suzhou, has a bad relationship with her husband, so quarrels are often heard. In May of this year, she suddenly ran away from her husband without a word and disappeared. Fang followed his wife and asked people everywhere, but there was no news. Then he found out that Zhou had been seduced by her brother-in-law, Jin Fubai, and was hiding in Jin's house in Suzhou. Fang followed and met her, but Zhou swore that she would not return to his house. Fang could not do anything and had to return to Shanghai. The day before yesterday, Zhou and Jin Fubai came to Shanghai and returned home. She said to her husband, "Now I regret what I did. I want to grow old with you." Fang was so happy to hear this that he forgot about the past and treated Jin as an honored guest because of their family relationship, and kept him for dinner. Afterwards, Fang went out, and when he returned at about 8 p.m., he suddenly saw that his wife Zhou and his brother-in-law Jin Fubai had packed the clothes and ornaments in the room into parcels. They were in a panic, planning to pack up and run away for the second time. Fang was very suspicious when he saw this, and realized that Zhou's regrets were all lies, and that she had come here to take the property. He was immediately angry and seized the two men and handed them over to Liu Chuanxi, the guard at the 23rd post, and brought them to the first branch of the first district. During the preliminary trial by the director, Fang filed a case and stated the situation, and asked for a strict investigation. Jin Baifu claimed that Fang Zhou was his sister-in-law. Because her husband, Fang Xuebao, was violent and Zhou was beaten if she disobeyed him, she returned to her mother's home in her hometown in May of this year because she was mistreated and did not want to live with Fang Xuebao. Fortunately, her mother repeatedly comforted her, and she changed her mind. So her mother asked me to accompany her to Shanghai today to send her back to Fang's house. Unexpectedly, Fang bit the hand that fed him, and did not appreciate his good intentions, but instead made up lies and accused him. He asked for investigation. Fang Zhou's statement was the same as Jin's. Since the two sides held conflicting statements, they were ordered to prepare a document and submit it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e134">蕢延芳 Does Not Want Empty Talk, Rejects Five-Year Boycott Plan <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association previously resolved to have 蕢延芳,徐永祚, and 李權時 draft a five-year plan to boycott Japanese goods, with the goal of maintaining the enthusiasm permanently, to avoid the criticism of a "five-minute" boycott. However, 蕢 and the others considered this matter to be of great importance, beyond the ability of a few individuals. If it was just empty talk on paper without practical benefit, they felt it was unnecessary. Therefore, they submitted a report to the association yesterday, stating: "Regarding the report, your esteemed association has entrusted 延芳,永祚, and 權時 with the task of drafting a five-year plan to boycott Japanese goods. We dare not fail to exert our meager efforts and contribute our humble opinions. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished by a few people closing their doors and building a car. Furthermore, if it is called a five-year plan to boycott Japanese goods, it should actually be a five-year industrial plan, or a self-sufficiency plan for necessities such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, which should be achieved through the collective wisdom and efforts of the people of the entire country. Not only are we three, with our limited knowledge, insufficient to shoulder this heavy responsibility, but even the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and people from all walks of life, who are rich in talent, may not be able to undertake this heavy responsibility alone. Moreover, for the success of any industrial plan, it is necessary to consider the country's productivity. Productivity does not only refer to the four tangible elements of land, capital, labor, and enterprise, but also includes intangible factors such as clear politics, social stability, labor-capital cooperation, convenient transportation, and the people's good intentions. We are now motivated by righteous indignation to launch the eighth boycott of Japanese goods, and we intend to take a further step to find a fundamental solution, which is to strive to manufacture domestic goods and plan for a five-year or ten-year industrial plan, which is a great undertaking. However, we should ask whether the four elements of production in our country are currently complete. Even if the four elements of production are complete, or can be made complete, what about the various preconditions for production? Therefore, if we only want to engage in empty talk about a five-year plan to boycott Japanese goods, or an industrial plan, that is all well and good. If we do not want to engage in empty talk, but want to implement the plan, then the problem may not be solved by planning and technology, and the key seems to lie in clear politics, social stability, labor-capital cooperation, transportation recovery, and the people's good intentions. If we can earnestly do these things, then national shame will be erased and the hatred of foreign goods will be eliminated. As for a detailed five-year plan or industrial plan, 延芳 and the others not only do not dare to rashly draft this major plan, but also feel that even if they do draft it, it would only amount to empty talk. This is because the current social and political situation cannot be improved in a day, and therefore is not suitable for any industrial plan or economic self-sufficiency plan. We hereby submit this report for your kind consideration."</p>

<p>Affected by the Boycott and Flooding, the Quantity of Imports and Exports Has Been Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>The 大美晚報 reported that due to the recent boycott of Japanese goods and the Yangtze River floods, the quantity of commercial goods imported and exported from Shanghai in July and the first half of August has been greatly reduced. Apart from a few batches of textiles and food products shipped to Dalian, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Yingkou, there were very few goods going to other northern ports. To southern ports, only limited quantities of textiles and food products were shipped to Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou. The items shipped from the above ports to Shanghai were sugar, seafood, and a limited amount of white rice. Since the interior suffered from flooding, the shipment of goods to Europe has almost completely stopped. Due to the poor silkworm cocoon harvest this year, the quantity of raw silk shipped to the United States has also been greatly reduced. Tung oil produced in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River cannot be shipped out due to the flood. Imports from Japan have been greatly reduced due to the boycott of Japanese goods. The shipment of goods to Japan has also been temporarily stopped. The goods shipped to the Yangtze River are almost entirely food supplies for disaster relief.</p>

<p>Expected to Be Purchased Entirely by the National Government</p>
<p>The 大陸報 reported that the large quantity of machine guns, rifles, aircraft bullets, and explosives brought by the German ship on Saturday night has now been unloaded and stored in the Lan Road warehouse. When the ship entered Chinese territorial waters, it was heavily armed and escorted along the way by customs patrol boats and more than twenty water police officers until the unloading was completed. This was because the military equipment was originally intended to be shipped to Guangdong, and there were concerns that someone from Guangdong might take the opportunity to hijack the ship, re-export it, and transfer it to a ship bound for Guangdong. According to what was heard last night, the explosives were originally intended for Japan, while the rest of the military equipment was originally intended for Guangdong. The quantity is not yet known with certainty, and the future disposition is still undecided. It is expected that the entire quantity will be purchased by the National Government.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Reaction to the British Public Bus Company's Dismissal of All Ticket Collectors <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Workers' Assembly Dispersed by Police Yesterday</p>
<p>Declaration Issued, Drivers to Serve as Mediators</p>
<p>Following the strike by all ticket collectors of the British Public Bus Company, the company yesterday continued to operate routes 1, 2, 5, and 9 with difficulty and announced the dismissal of all ticket collectors, hiring new workers. The workers' assembly failed to convene due to police intervention. Yesterday, the drivers offered to mediate, and the workers issued a declaration seeking assistance. The details of yesterday's events are recorded below:</p>
<p>勉强行駛 With Difficulty, Continuing Operation: Starting yesterday, the company continued to send ticket inspectors to replace ticket collectors, barely managing to operate ten buses on route 1 from Jing'an Temple to the Gongyuan Shooting Range, six buses on route 2 from Eryang Bridge to the Gongyuan Shooting Range, three buses on route 5 from Sanmaoge Bridge to the North Railway Station, nine buses on route 9 from Jing'an Temple to the Electric Light Factory, one 'A' special express bus, and one 'C' special express bus, totaling thirty buses. All other routes remain suspended.</p>
<p>工人大會 Workers' Assembly: The Public Bus Strike Committee held a general meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday inside the China Park on Suzhou Road to discuss how to deal with the company's rejection of the nine proposed conditions. It was reported that over 180 ticket collectors and driver representatives were in the middle of discussions when armed detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station arrived and dispersed the meeting. The meeting was thus unable to be completed and was rescheduled. However, all the workers were extremely agitated by the police interference with their assembly.</p>
<p>全體革退 Dismissal of All: According to the British Public Bus Company yesterday, the nine conditions proposed by the ticket collectors had been completely rejected. It was also stated that all 222 striking ticket collectors had been dismissed and 40 new ticket collectors were being trained at the Connaught Road headquarters. Once training is complete, they will be assigned to various routes.</p>
<p>公司損失 Company Losses: Following the strike by all ticket collectors of the Public Bus Company on the 20th, the company has tried to maintain traffic by sending ticket inspectors to perform the duties of the ticket collectors, barely managing to operate a few routes. However, the company's daily business losses are estimated to be over 3,000 yuan. The workers' intangible losses are also countless.</p>
<p>司機會議 Drivers' Meeting: Over 250 drivers of the Public Bus Company, in order to support the ticket collectors, held a representative meeting at 8:00 AM yesterday. The meeting resolved on the spot to first offer mediation and then to join the strike. Yesterday afternoon, three representatives were sent to negotiate with the company. The results are not yet known, and further reports will follow.</p>
<p>工方宣言 Workers' Declaration: The declaration by all striking workers of the British Public Bus Company reads: To the citizens of Shanghai, fellow workers in all factories, we, the public bus workers, are now on strike, causing much inconvenience to you all. We are extremely sorry for this. However, we have had to adopt such a decisive measure due to our own compelling reasons: 1. The global economic panic has further bankrupted China's economy and worsened our lives. The value of gold is high, the value of silver is low, and the prices of all goods are soaring. Although our wages remain the same in nominal terms, they have actually decreased. 2. The company recently switched to using diesel fuel, increasing profits several times over. However, operating diesel engines requires even greater effort. This can be said to be an extension of our working hours. 3. The wages of ticket sellers are low and are not enough to cover monthly expenses. Inevitably, there are occasional instances of taking small advantages. We ourselves find this behavior difficult to condone. If wages were slightly higher, we would definitely not resort to such measures. Originally, our wages were only 20 yuan. After deducting all sorts of unreasonable penalties, such as a fine of one yuan for not jumping off at the next stop, a fine of five jiao for forgetting to close the window, a fine of one yuan for sitting on the bus, a fine of one yuan for not wearing a numbered hat, etc., the actual wages received each month are only a little over ten yuan, which is simply not enough to support one person's life. If there are several people in the family, one can only sit and wait for death. Now the company has added plainclothes ticket inspectors who secretly monitor on the bus. Whenever a ticket seller makes a mistake in punching or sorting tickets, or has a slight dispute with a customer, they are mistakenly accused of taking small advantages. One report is enough to have business suspended. In recent days, more than ten people have been dismissed without any evidence. Citizens of Shanghai, fellow workers in all factories, we are in such cruel treatment conditions that we cannot wait any longer. Because we do not want to starve to death, do not want to see our families separated, and do not want to become slaves, we have unanimously gone on strike to make our demands to the capitalists. We vow not to return to work until our goals are achieved. This is not us disregarding public convenience, this is not us making unreasonable threats. The capitalists are cruel, and we are really forced to this situation. Citizens of Shanghai, fellow workers in all factories, in the process of our struggle with the capitalists, the capitalists will of course use various methods to sabotage us, block us, and spread rumors to slander us. Therefore, all our workers earnestly request that you maintain a fair attitude, stand on the side of our class, and give us practical and powerful assistance in terms of spirit and material. If so, all the workers of the British Public Bus Company will be fortunate, and all the workers of Shanghai will be fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Please Release Anhui Rice for Transport to Shanghai <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Anhui Rice Merchants in Shanghai to the Xiashi Grain Industry Association</p>
<p>Due to Anhui rice being banned from leaving Xiashi by the Public Security Bureau, the Anhui Rice Merchants Association in Shanghai sent a special letter to the Xiashi Grain Industry Association yesterday. The original letter is recorded as follows: Respectfully, we are writing to you because our member Mei Fuqing and others reported to our association that in April of this year, they transported over 2,000 shi of rice from Sanhe to Xiashi, but it remained in storage due to the sluggish market. Recently, the market in Xiashi remains stagnant, and after months of various expenses, the losses have been too great. In the blink of an eye, the time for the new harvest is approaching, and it cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, we planned to transport it to Shanghai for sale. Unexpectedly, when setting sail, the Public Security Bureau of your town, citing the provincial order banning rice from leaving the province, and also referring to your association's letter of inquiry, etc., prevented it from doing so. Upon investigation, the provincial order banning rice from leaving the province only applies to special Zhejiang rice. There is absolutely no need to prohibit the earlier stored Anhui rice. Now it is being transported to Jiangsu Province, so why is it not allowed to be transported freely? Although the polder fields in Anhui Province suffered from floods this year, there should be mountainous areas that can be harvested. In the future, when new rice is transported to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, many Anhui merchants will likely regard your town as a dangerous place due to such actions, which may have an impact on the people's food supply in the future. Your association is a leader in the rice industry, regulating the people's food supply and showing compassion for merchants' difficulties, which should be taken into consideration. Moreover, the 20th and 21st reports in your town listed the daily market prices, showing that there are more than 100,000 shi of Anhui rice stored, while Zhejiang Province has had a bumper harvest this year. Why worry about a food shortage? Recently, Wenzhou xian rice from Zhejiang Province has been transported to Shanghai for sale, which is puzzling. Based on this, and for the sake of the current difficulties of the merchants and the future food supply of the people, we dare to write to your association, requesting you to quickly consult the Xiashi Public Security Bureau and order the release of the Anhui rice transported to Shanghai by Mei Fuqing and others in order to facilitate circulation and stabilize commerce. We eagerly await your response. Respectfully presented, hoping for a speedy reply.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Recent News from the Local Autonomy Training Institute <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Continued Enrollment of New Students, Regardless of Gender</p>
<p>The Institute's Address Expands and Relocates to the Southern City</p>
<p>The Local Autonomy Training Institute in this city is currently continuing to run the second phase. Mayor Zhang deeply believes that the purpose of the city government in establishing this institute is to train personnel to handle local autonomy. During the period of political tutelage, the government will appoint people to assist the people in preparing for and implementing autonomy in order to promote constitutional government. The responsibilities are heavy, so the institute is expanding its funding, hiring specialized professors, and raising the level of the students. The previous enrollment was very strict, with only 50 students being admitted. This time, more students are needed to be recruited. If there is a enthusiastic registration, the number of students will also be increased. It is reported that the first place in the previous enrollment was a female student. The institute believes that the implementation of local autonomy should especially promote gender equality, so it is only appropriate to admit students regardless of gender when cultivating talent. The original address of the institute on Zhabei Zhiyi Road is now insufficient and the transportation is inconvenient, so a large building at 81 Xieqiao Manufacturing Bureau Road in the southern city has been rented and will be moved there at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>It is also learned that after the first phase of students at the institute completed their internships, the institute will submit the students' grades to the city government for screening and assignment of work. The city government has now carefully reviewed the students' grades and finalized a list of people, most of whom will be sent to various districts to assist in the preparation for autonomy, and a small number of students will be sent to various bureaus for trial use. It is said that the list will be announced soon.</p>

<p>Sent a Letter to the Taxpayer Association for Handling</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayer Association yesterday, stating that on the 12th of this month, it received a letter from the Ironware Industry Association, stating that the factory of Jiang Jinchang, a member of the association, had been using tap water for 13 years since the seventh year of the Republic, and had never delayed payment of water bills. Recently, the tap water company suddenly demanded a deposit of 150 yuan, and threatened to cut off the water supply if payment was not made. The association requested that the Chinese consultant negotiate with the tap water company. It was found that the tap water fees in the concession were directly collected by the tap water company from the landlords. The method was to install branch pipes from the main pipe at the alley entrance to supply water to each household. There were no water meters or deposits. However, when Jiang Jinchang's factory was built in the seventh year of the Republic, Zhoujiazui Road was far from the main water pipe, so a 4-point water pipe was installed separately. At that time, a installation fee of 67 taels of silver was paid. Since the installation, the water bills have never been in arrears. The deposit was originally a guarantee. The factory owner already owns the property and would not damage their reputation for a small amount of water bill. The factory believes that since a deposit of three months' water bill has been collected, monthly fees should not be charged, or interest on the deposit should be set and paid with the user's consent before payment is made. Later, our association sent people to seek your opinion, and you also stated that the factory is an old user of more than ten years, and cannot be compared to a new user installing water pipes whose credit is unknown to the company. The so-called cutting off the water supply and taking strict measures is not the proper way to treat the company's customers. Moreover, there are many users in the concession who have water meters but have not paid deposits, so why should there be such an unreasonable measure for users who have never been in arrears? Furthermore, the tap water expert hired by the company will arrive in Shanghai soon, and all issues can be temporarily put on hold. After deliberation at the 59th Standing Committee meeting of our association, based on the above situation, we have written to the Taxpayer Association to handle the matter accordingly.</p>

<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday was as follows: The weather on the coast here is cloudy with strong northeasterly gusts and intermittent rain. The weather is extremely bad over the East China Sea and along the coast from the mouth of the Yangtze River to Fuzhou, with a violent cyclone/hurricane continuing to move northwestward, approaching the coast between Wenzhou and Taizhou. There are strong northeasterly winds on the Yellow Sea. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 90.1 degrees and the lowest was 79.0 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 96.1 degrees and the lowest was 72.3 degrees.</p>
<p>Letters Received</p>
<p>Respectfully, I read in your newspaper's local news column that the family of Zhao Shixi, a resident of Dongchijiabang in Hongzhen, North Shanghai, was targeted by bandits. At 11:00 PM the night before, three bandits suddenly came and robbed 21 silver dollars. Zhao was shot by the bandits, fell to the ground injured, and was barely breathing. His family reported the incident to the Fourth Office of the Fifth District. I was very surprised. Upon investigation, our office has not received any report from the people about the above incident, and the area is not under the jurisdiction of our office. It seems that there was a mistake in the investigation. I am writing this letter to request you to investigate and correct the information. With best wishes, this is addressed to the editor of the Shenbao, from the Fourth Office of the Fifth District of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, August 24.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your newspaper reported on the 23rd on the case of impersonating officials to order military goods. The defendant, Bi Ke, claimed, "I have a lot to say, but all the important documents are with my lawyer, Pyleme. Now Pyleme is not appearing in court today because I am unable to pay the legal fees, and the documents have not been returned. This situation is very detrimental to the ethics of lawyers." I was very surprised to read this. Upon investigation, this lawyer received a letter written in Bi Ke's own hand on the 21st of this month, stating that when the court was scheduled to hear the case at 9:00 AM on the 22nd, please don't go to the court at that time. The letter can prove that what was written in your newspaper, that I was unable to pay the legal fees, is also incorrect. When Bi Ke hired this lawyer to handle the case, the legal fees had already been paid. This lawyer's non-appearance on the 22nd was to follow the instructions of the client. What was written in your newspaper must have been a mistake in reporting. I am writing to request correction. This is to send you peace. Lawyer Pyleme, August 24, 20th year.</p>

<p>— Sea Passenger</p>
<p>Invisible Glasses</p>
<p>All people with nearsightedness or farsightedness in both eyes have to wear glasses on their noses to aid their vision. However, most fashionable men and women generally do not think glasses are a fashionable accessory and are often unwilling to wear them. The degree of nearsightedness and farsightedness will inevitably increase as a result. Now, the British have invented a new type of invisible glasses that can solve this difficult problem. The inventor is an employee of a large eyeglasses company. He made a very small lens, slightly like a disc, which is tightly embedded between the upper and lower eyelids, covering the eyeball, so that people cannot see that he is wearing glasses from a few feet away. Because the lens is exceptionally thin, it is like nothing.</p>
<p>These glasses are most suitable for actors. Usually, those who suffer from nearsightedness and wear glasses cannot wear glasses in the play they are playing. Even if he is good at performing, he has to hire someone else. As soon as these invisible glasses come out, any character can be played without any difficulty.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Mr. Feng is Immortal <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Junmu of Cixi, with his extensive knowledge and noble integrity, is a great master of Confucianism. His doorstep is always full of people seeking to learn characters from him. His "Returning Wind" collection is known throughout the country. In his later years, he lived in Shanghai, and he associated with many famous people of his time. People like Zhu Guwei, Xiao Song, Cheng Zida, and Wu Changshuo all admired his writing and respected his actions. Their carriages often visited each other, and they were as happy as old friends. Moreover, both Xiao Song and Wu Changshuo had last words, insisting that Mr. Feng inscribe their tombs. This shows how his writing and morality were admired by the world. He passed away in Shanghai on May 18 of this year, after suffering from illness for several months from winter to summer. Friends and associates visited him, their feet wearing a path to his courtyard. Some stayed up all night to serve him, unwilling to leave. When he passed away, they all burst into tears, unable to control their grief. The memorial service was attended by hundreds of people. If he had not possessed great virtue and cultivated himself internally, how could he have moved his peers to such an extent? On the 23rd of the month, Zhu Guwei, Wang Yiting, Chen Qihui, and Zhang Yongni launched a public memorial service. His disciples, Chen Bulei, Wu Jingxiong, and others, wore black gauze armbands as a sign of mourning and attended the meeting. There were more than a hundred people in attendance. Chen Qihui was chosen to preside over the memorial service because he had the deepest relationship with Mr. Feng. He was asked to report on Mr. Feng's brief history. Chen said that he and Mr. Feng had been friends since childhood. He knew that Mr. Feng's writing was already brilliant when he returned to Cixi from Songjiang at the age of fourteen. Mr. Feng was born with a good appearance, was intelligent and pure, and could recognize all the classics and hundreds of schools of thought at first sight, as if he had been blessed by heaven. At that time, his predecessors all regarded him as a child prodigy. Everyone knew that Mr. Feng was kind and approachable and did not compete with the world. They did not know that his views were also very radical when he was young. After drinking, he would write articles that were arrogant and disregardful of everything. Later, because he was teaching in Hangzhou, he was noticed by the authorities. His family was afraid that he would cause trouble, so they said that his mother was ill and sent a telegram to call him back home. He was naturally filial and, after receiving the telegram, regardless of whether the tide of the Cao'e River was favorable or not, he rushed home at the risk of his life, arriving home within twenty-four hours. He made friends regardless of poverty or wealth and did not change his principles due to life or death. However, when it came to discussing writing, he was unwilling to show weakness even to his closest friends. He was very frugal in his own life, but he did his best to help his poor relatives. He was good at guiding and educating young learners. He would always praise even the smallest abilities. First, he would arouse their interest, and then he would encourage them to improve their skills. Therefore, his disciples respected and loved him as they would their fathers and brothers. Wu Jingxiong's eulogy read: "For decades, he has been a mentor, with ten thousand volumes in his chest. I, as a young man, once benefited from his teachings." "Just one year away from his sixtieth birthday, his spirit entered my dreams. I cannot bear to read his will, 'Returning Wind.'" As a result, because Mr. Feng's posthumous works included several volumes of essays from the Returning Wind Hall, several volumes of poems, one volume of ci poems, several volumes of notes, and several volumes of miscellaneous works, none of which have been published, it would be a great pity to let them be lost. Therefore, eight old friends, including Chen Qihui, and disciple representatives, including Chen Bulei and Sha Menghai, were elected to preside over the printing of Mr. Feng's collected poems and essays. The disciples also formed the Returning Wind Society, which will hold meetings and offer sacrifices on Mr. Feng's death anniversary every year in order to connect the feelings of fellow students and commemorate Mr. Feng's great virtue.</p>

<p>Visiting Yan Ziling's Fishing Platform</p>
<p>Not seeking wealth or avoiding ennoblement.</p>
<p>Alone I fish amidst flowing waters and towering mountains.</p>
<p>Alas, Yan Gong is now gone.</p>
<p>Only a clear sorrow remains on the solitary hill.</p>
<p>Passing the Songjun Villa</p>
<p>Emerald green on the opposite west tower.</p>
<p>Outside the gate, a spring flows over the stones.</p>
<p>Such serenity is truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>Floating clouds and wealth are not needed.</p>
<p>Mountain Village Rain Scene</p>
<p>Bamboo fence and thatched cottage slant in the rain.</p>
<p>Mountain colors are hazy, veiled by a thin mist.</p>
<p>Willows droop along the path, all in tears.</p>
<p>Where solitary smoke rises, there is a home.</p>
<p>The above three seven-character quatrains were written by Xuejiu during his spring tour of the Fuchun River. They have been on my desk for a long time and are about to be thrown into the servant's word basket. I love their clarity and Song-like style. I quickly presented them to Mr. Shoujuan for publication in the Free Talk. Yang Xue also attached this note.</p>
<h3 id="e159">My Views on Grain Storage <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu I Sheng</p>
<p>Recently, I have been suffering from hemorrhoids, making it painful to walk, sit, or lie down, so I have not been attending social gatherings for a long time. Yesterday, while in bed due to illness, I read in the newspaper a list of donors for grain storage, and I saw the name Chen Yiyuan. I don't know if there is another person with that name, or if it is a mistake for the character "Xu". I have a humble opinion that I would like to contribute to the authorities in the hope that it will be adopted. I have always thought that the most important element of the grain storage system should be replacing the old with the new, taking from the surplus and supplementing the insufficient, so that everyone will be willing to participate and not just watch. It would be best to establish a method where every donation of ten yuan to the grain storage fund would entitle the donor to withdraw one dan of rice each month, based on the prevailing rice price, with a maximum limit in yuan. The price should only be allowed to fall, not rise. For those who store for half a year or a year, the price should be reduced by five percent each month according to the market price, and storage receipts should be given, with rice issued according to the predetermined monthly period. Delivery costs would be calculated separately. For example, if one stores rice for a year, paying 120 yuan, it would be issued in twelve monthly installments. The price for the second month would be reduced by one jiao, and the price for the twelfth month would be reduced by six jiao. If this were done, everyone would be happy to have the security of a bargain. Businesses, factories, schools, organizations, and households of all sizes would enthusiastically invest to prevent the impact of high rice prices. If a family of one hundred were to store sixteen dan of rice per month, they would collect a fund of 160 yuan. With a population of three million in Shanghai, storing about 160,000 dan of rice per month, and with the purchase price at thirteen yuan, it would amount to about two million yuan. When starting to raise funds for grain storage, cash of 1.6 million yuan would be received successively. The money would be deposited in the treasury to earn interest, and rice would be paid out each month as needed. This would require purchasing 60,000 dan of rice each day, costing only 800,000 yuan. Selling 50,000 dan of rice, with a supplemental price of three yuan, would yield a daily supplemental cash income of 150,000 yuan. The actual amount of money needed would only be 200,000 yuan, and even this amount may not be necessary. After all, there must be a surplus in the turnover of funds. Everyone is worried about future difficulties and will not just think about the present. Therefore, many will choose to store for a year or half a year. If we assume that the average storage period is four months, we would collect 6.4 million yuan in storage funds, and with good credit, raising ten million would not be difficult. If we adopt this strategy, starting with me, storing for half a year would amount to nearly a thousand. It would also be easier to solicit donations. Otherwise, asking someone to donate is tantamount to receiving a favor, and the obligation to reciprocate is endless. In the past ten years, I have felt this difficulty and have regarded it as a debt, even worse than a debt. I believe others must feel the same way. Therefore, I offer this humble opinion as a way to capitalize on the situation, as described above. I hope it will be adopted. (No reward is necessary.)</p>
<h3 id="e160">North Railway Station Anecdotes <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Aicheng</p>
<p>The sensational Zhujing infanticide case involving Wang Tao and Xia Aqing has already resulted in the Jinshan County government sentencing them to death and twelve years imprisonment respectively. This matter could have been considered closed, but Wang Tao refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Suzhou High Court. The Jinshan County government specially transferred the entire case file and the three major criminals to Shanghai from Jin, traveling on the 25th Shanghai-Changzhou commuter train on the afternoon of the 19th. By about 2:00 PM, the three criminals had boarded the train. Station personnel were competing to read the latest infanticide reports. I also went with a friend to observe. By this time, the train was already packed. Wang Tao and the other two were bound with hemp rope. Xia Aqing even had iron shackles on her feet. Wang Tao's face was round and large, and her hair was neatly styled. She was dressed in skirts and looked down, as if overcome with shame. The wet nurse sat next to Wang Tao, constantly fanning her mistress to relieve the heat. Xia Aqing was feigning sleep. In addition to the three criminals, the Jinshan County government also sent bailiffs to escort them. The onlookers were discussing the case, some criticizing her as an adulteress, others condemning her son's absurdity. The three criminals remained silent. Their sorrow was evident.</p>
<p>This time, Chairman Chiang came to Shanghai from Jiangxi to act as a pallbearer for Madame Soong. Because the Communists had not been eliminated, he returned to Nanjing early on the morning of the 20th. At 9:00 AM, the area around the North Railway Station was already closed to traffic. Military police were heavily deployed, and secret agents were everywhere. Soldiers were drawing their guns as if ready to fire. More than a hundred armed police officers stood on the platform. Soon, more than ten members of a military band arrived. Everyone was eager to catch a glimpse of the Chairman's imposing presence and waited with bated breath. At 9:30 AM, the train slowly moved, but the Chairman was still nowhere to be seen. Then an officer arrived, panting, and said that the Chairman had already left and the lockdown could be lifted. It was hard to tell what was true. No one knew when he had boarded the train. Some said that the Chairman did not like being seen off and boarded the train at Zhenru. However, it caused the military police to rush around for half a day, which was also quite a hardship.</p>
<p>There are many scams at the North Railway Station, but there are also those who are wandering outside due to poverty. A few days ago, a woman and a young child pleaded with the ticket seller, saying that they were stranded and wanted to return to Suzhou but had no money. They begged for assistance. The ticket clerk, feeling sorry for them, raised over a yuan and bought them a ticket, personally escorting them onto the train. Those who saw it praised him for his righteous and courageous act.</p>

<p>In 1906, in the Borja region near Rome, a man named Cesare was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment for the crime of killing a wealthy lawyer named Branzier. At the end of last month, his sentence expired, and he was released from prison. He then married a woman named Lamartine. It is said that this Lamartine was in love with Cesare even before he committed the crime. Because her lover was imprisoned, she remained unmarried. However, up to five years ago, she was still hesitant. But for the past five years, she was confident that her fiancé would eventually be released, and she waited with unwavering determination. Now, she has finally married him and is living a happy life. It can be said that true love conquers all. Counting from the time her fiancé was imprisoned, it has been twenty-five years.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>That evening, Reverend Naren Misha invited me to his home and to observe a wedding ceremony of his townspeople, which was somewhat similar to those in China. The groom rides a horse and wears flowers. The drums and music went to the bride's house. The father also went to celebrate. They met and exchanged gifts. When a guest went, he was also given a wreath. Before leaving, the guest was given a coconut. Sometimes a perfume atomizer was used to spray the passing guests. This kind of wedding, where the parents arranged the marriage, was the old style. The new style took place in a public place, like in China. But the new style has not yet become widespread in India.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th, I met with C.H. Bose. Bose was a businessman I stayed with before. He told me about a great immortal's place of cultivation, which was located in the high mountains and forests northwest of Nepal. You can get there by going up from Delhi. He was also going to go there to abandon the mortal world. There were many immortals living in that forest, eating fruit and drinking water, and practicing meditation. As for the great immortal, he could stay in the snow without feeling cold. Bose was a wealthy merchant without a wife. He told me many truths and asked me what I would do if I encountered a tiger or a snake. He said that he had encountered a tiger twice and a large snake once. He would only silently recite a prayer. If they ate him, he would save himself a lot of trouble. If they left him alone, he would accept it. He was not afraid. I thought it was strange that Bose had always lived with others, but now he was saying this. But it was a common view among Indians. Gandhi viewed the British bullets with the same attitude. Bose showed me a map and said that east of Nepal was a small independent country that did not belong to Britain or China. It was located west of Bhutan, east of Nepal, and south of Tibet, on the high mountains. The place was called Sikkim.</p>
<p>There were many people there who practiced Taoism and studied Buddhism. He had two places to go. One was the place where the great immortal lived, northwest of Nepal, where the Ganges River originated. The other was east of Nepal, in the Darjeeling area, in Sikkim. I heard that the British did not allow people to enter Tibet without British permission, so investigating it was not easy. I thought that the Himalayas were the highest mountains in the world. Indian culture originated here. Hinduism was the mother of Buddhism, and Hinduism originated from this mountain and the Ganges River. Buddha was influenced by Hinduism, so he also went to the snowy mountains to practice and preached by the Ganges River. I hope that Buddhist disciples from our country will come and visit together, as the snowy mountains are near Tibet, to appreciate its flavor. Bose wanted to invite me to visit the high mountain immortals for a month, but I was unable to due to illness. In short, there are many strange things in the Himalayas. I hope that people from our country will explore them. A certain Japanese man had stayed in India for more than ten years and wrote a travelogue about Tibet, bringing a servant who was Chinese. The servant's wife was Tibetan. The Indians still often mentioned it. Our Chinese people have no lack of capital, but some are focused on increasing their wealth, while others are busy gambling day and night. The secrets of the Himalayas are left to the Japanese to explore. The Chinese do not know about it. The Daoist Jie Shi was determined to go, but had to stop due to economic difficulties, which is a pity.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Random Notes from a Northeast Survey (1) <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Suijiu</p>
<p>(1) The Northeast and Manchuria-Mongolia</p>
<p>I have lived in the Northeast for over a year. During this year, in addition to lecturing at Northeast University, I have also traveled to various places from time to time to conduct surveys and interviews, collecting a great deal of research data on various aspects of the Northeast. What I have seen and heard is even more countless.</p>
<p>I often study the word "Northeast" as a substitute for "Manchuria-Mongolia," and I feel that it is not appropriate. Because "Northeast" is a directional and indefinite name, while "Manchuria-Mongolia" is a geographically defined term. If we rashly say "Northeast," the listener will not know what we are referring to, especially when speaking to foreigners. If we mention "Manchuria-Mongolia" to anyone, they will immediately understand that we are referring to China's three eastern provinces and Inner and Outer Mongolia. Therefore, the Japanese use "Manchuria-Mongolia" instead of the word "Northeast," which they have no choice but to do. Some Chinese say that this is because the Japanese intend to divide the Northeast. In fact, if the Japanese or Europeans call it "Northeast," they are clearly referring to the Northeast of their own country or a specific Northeast that they want to refer to, rather than the Northeast within China's territory. Therefore, I use the term "Northeastern China" as the title, which is easier to understand and can be used as an international common name.</p>
<p>What we today call the Northeast was indeed the base of the Manchu and Mongol peoples. There is no denying that Manchuria-Mongolia was originally Jianzhou, owned by the Han people. Mongolia has also benefited from the influence of the Han people. Whether it was still owned by the Han people in prehistoric times is a question for archeology.</p>
<p>(2) Overview of Northeastern University</p>
<p>I have been interested in the problem of Northeastern China for many years. After leaving Wuhan University during the summer vacation last year, I traveled to Dalian and Shenyang. Then I received an invitation from Northeastern University, which gave me more convenience in studying the problem of Northeastern China.</p>
<p>Northeastern University was established in the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), thanks to the efforts of Xie Yinchang (from Jiangsu), the director of education in Fengtian Province. He worked hard on the planning and fundraising. At that time, the plan was completed, but the funds were not available. Later, he discussed it with Wang Yongjiang, the governor of the province, and urged him to serve as the president of the university. Wang asked how much money was needed. Xie proposed a budget of two million yuan. Wang smiled and nodded, saying that for the sake of Northeastern education, he was willing to work hard to exchange the position of a university president for two million yuan. The matter was then completed. Xie resigned from his position as director due to overwork and went to Harbin to recuperate. After that, Wang Yongjiang joined forces with the governors of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces to jointly fund the establishment of a university with science and engineering departments based on the original Shenyang Advanced Normal School, and established liberal arts and law departments based on the public literary vocational school. He also obtained permission from the Qing imperial family to allocate 400 mu of official land in front of Zhaoling Mausoleum, excluding the white pine trees, as the site for the Northeastern University factory. The total capital was 2.8 million yuan. In total, the entire university covered an area of more than 1,580 mu. The liberal arts and law schools and student dormitories cost about one million yuan. There were also science and engineering school buildings, science and engineering student dormitories, education school buildings, and education student dormitories, each costing tens of thousands of yuan. There was also a president's office building.</p>

<p>Fell Ten Taels and Seven Qian Sharply. Yesterday, the 24th, the opening gold price was flat in the morning, weak at noon, and especially tired in the afternoon. The wind and waves were turbulent, but the spot trading in the middle market was only two or three taels. The total market difference was about fourteen or fifteen taels. In the end, it fell sharply by more than ten taels. The buying and selling of each firm was very different, but many parties had something to spit out. The industry's intention turned from high to low, probably because the silver market had no honor or disgrace the day before. US stocks fell slightly and were not affected. Therefore, the initial opening fell slightly and then went upward. However, the foreign exchange seemed to be hardening. Sellers suddenly rose at noon and it was reported that a certain bank's spot goods were still being shipped out slowly. Therefore, the market price suddenly turned downstream, and the later market felt even more sluggish. Sellers were excited, because the exchange rate was even looser, which led to the breaking of the 770 tael mark. It ended within 65 taels, but the bank's appetite was not bad, and the surface had a little dragging in, so it had already pulled up four or five taels.</p>
<p>The initial opening saw a slight setback. The October opening in the early morning fell by one tael and five qian, to 778 taels, while the silver market only had an eighth of an inch added to the private telegram, and the market was stagnant. Then, because Zhifeng, Yongyu, Daping, and other goods came in, it increased to 79 taels and three qian. However, there seemed to be more sellers, and it retreated to 76 taels and five qian. Sumitomo and HSBC then collected 1,275 pounds of gold in September and October, and Yuantao, Yongkai, and Japanese merchants bought in. Now it has picked up two taels, to 79 taels and two qian. The British gold revelation was as usual. The time was flat, but Fuxing, Yongchun, Yuanyuan, Yongyuancheng, and others all had sales. Moreover, with the recent British gold at 1,275, entry and exit can be done, so it has fallen by four taels. At 10:00 AM, it was 75 taels. Suddenly, Yuantao, Yongshunli, and hedging firms purchased in succession, and the price went up secretly, increasing by two taels and several qian. Until 11:15 AM, it was 77 taels and seven or eight qian. It was unexpected that Daxing, Yongyuancheng, Kangxiang, Hongli, Richang, Xiexing, Yuyucheng, Yongdeng, and others tended to sell, which caused British gold to loosen as well. Sumitomo Bank bought 1.3 in November 8125 to 875. In about half an hour, it plunged by six taels. After 11:30 AM, it was 72 taels. At this time, Guangbang customers and Zhifeng, Yongshunli, and others paid in, and the Indian exchange telegrams went down by three annas. It improved by two taels. At 11:45 AM, it was 74 taels and six or seven qian, but Daxing, Yonghongxing, Yong, and retail investors continued to sell, losing another two taels. At noon, it was 72 taels and one qian. It then added five or six qian and then fell by four or five qian, but there was no major change. At noon, it closed at 72 taels and three qian. After entering, it did two taels inside and outside. The revealed price was still 811 taels and eight qian, with a discount of between 32 and 33 taels and 40 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon was increasingly unsustainable. The post-market opened at 71 taels and three qian, which was the opening of the goods, and Wanhua Shunli immediately sold out. Then there were several qian up and down, from one tael and six or seven qian to about one tael. The Indian exchange rate rose by three or four annas. Soon, Daxing, Yongfuchang, Hengxing, Yuanyuan, Chuntai, Changyuan, Chengzhi, Fengyong, and others had sell-offs. The British gold was even looser. Japanese commercial banks bought 1.3, and the price plummeted by six or seven taels, suddenly becoming 64 taels and five qian at 2:30 PM. Suddenly, it was heard that Daxing Yongfu bought it back, and Yongheng and others also bought it. It then added two and a half taels in half an hour, to 67 taels. Unfortunately, the selling wind did not stop until after 3:00 PM, and it fell again to 65 taels. Banks did each other's October British gold 1.3, and US dollars 30.01875. At that time, it pulled up another tael, and the trading was flat, standing between 66 and 67 taels. After 4:00 PM, Qianchang Xiang Richang and others entered, and after a while, it was pushed up to two taels. Then it was 69 taels and two qian. At the 4:30 PM close, it was 68 taels and eight qian, a sharp drop of ten taels and seven qian compared to the end of last week. According to the maximum of 79 taels and three qian throughout the day and the minimum of 64 taels, 14 taels and eight qian. Looking back, the spot price was flat. The goods in the early market were 78 taels and three qian, 2 taels at noon, 1 tael and 2 qian in the afternoon, and 69 taels at closing. The revealed price was discounted between 40 and 46-47 taels, and finally 43 taels. The accounts were 69 taels, 72 taels, and 69 taels for water supplement. In the afternoon, it was 66 taels. The spot goods were flat, adding 9 and a half taels, and the transaction was normal. Sellers were quite excited. According to the transaction statistics of each firm on the table, Qianchangxiang, Yuantao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Yuda, Bingxing, Yifengyong, Dadecheng, Huixiang, Shunli, and others all entered. Daxingyong, Fuxingyong, Yucheng Yong, Richang, Hongxingyong, Tongfengheng, and Yuankangxiang all sold short. Wanxing, Yuanxingyong, Yuantai, Fuyu, Hengyu, Futaiheng, Tongtaichang, and others went in and out. Wu sold something. In the afternoon, Yuantao Yong, Dadecheng, Yongheng, Richang, Fuxingyong, and Bingxing entered. Qianchangxiang, Yuanxingyong, Yuantai, Yuanchun, Longsheng, and Futaiheng had different entries and exits. Tongfengheng, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Zhifengyong, Hengxingyuan, and Shunli all exited. Daxingyong first exited and then entered, hedging, and abandoned the exchange rate. The number of trades in the Guangbang province reached 2,000 for earlier demand and later supply, and more than 2,500 for total exit.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the exchange rates posted by HSBC all remained unchanged except for the German exchange rate, which was reduced by half a yuan to 123 and a half marks, and the Hong Kong rate, which was reduced by 125 to 80 taels 4375. The silver market had also not changed the day before, and the market was flat. However, the transaction prices of banks all tended to be weak. The morning was flat and then loose, and the afternoon was especially weak. The gold market had broken into less than 770 taels. Large households were selling, and the bulls were suddenly hit. The result was that British gold was up 1875, US dollars were up 25, Japanese gold was down 2 cents, and most Chinese merchants were selling. The total amount of British gold traded was about 200,000 pounds, and the banks had a good appetite, especially the Japanese banks. The amount of US dollars was not high, and only the Dalian gang sold tens of thousands of yuan of Japanese gold, and the trend of all exchanges was already loose. However, there was no foreign news. It is said that the large silver bars may have a rising image.</p>

<p>Market Overview In recent days, the silver base climate has shown a slightly nervous nature due to its internal content, so the overall trend is beautiful. Even if there is no mad rush to raise prices, there is still a tight shape and color. This time, affected by the bankruptcy of Zhihe Zhuang, the interbank bill trading has inevitably been picky, so the situation is particularly exposed, and the demolition price has risen. As for the Lifa price, because of the gastric obstruction and stagnation, the situation is exhausted, so there is no good news worth recording.</p>
<p>Lifa Demolition Prices (Foreign Lifa) In the early and mid-morning markets, the foreign Lifa prices were slightly higher than the previous day, at 7 qian 2 cents 5 li 2 hao and a half, which seemed to be 1 hao and 2 hu and a half higher, but the trading trend felt lower and softer. (Silver Demolition) 1 qian 6 cents in the early market and 1 qian 5 cents in the mid-market were slightly smaller than the previous day, but the content was still beautiful, so adding water to the top still had about 1 qian, reaching a maximum of 1 qian 2-3 cents. The bank's listed price was 6 cents.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation The early market price of Jiangnan small ocean was 6 qian 5 cents 2 li 7 hao and a half, and the mid-market price was 6 qian 5 cents 2 li, which was 3 li and a half higher than the previous day.

<h3 id="e168">Public Bonds and Securities Rise and Fall Differently <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities market and various bond market conditions, the spot market was very deserted, the futures market was quite calm, and the buyers and sellers were very idle. The calm situation was no different from before. The bond prices were still chaotic, with this rising and that falling, and there was no consistent trend. Because the bond market environment did not change slightly, the major households were waiting and watching as before, and the market was mostly in scattered entries and exits. The supply and demand had no major changes, and the bond market prices only changed with the temporary supply and demand situation in the market. The rise and fall were slight, and the number of increases and decreases from the previous day was only a few jiao. Except for the 20th Customs in August, which rose by six and a half jiao, and the spot price of the 19th Customs, which was slightly lower by seven jiao, the other rises and falls were only two or three jiao. It is estimated that the total spot transaction volume for the whole day was 7,500 yuan, and the futures transaction volume was more than 8.8 million in the morning session and 4.4 million in the afternoon session, totaling more than 13.2 million. Among them, the transaction volume of the 20th Customs of the Unified Tax was relatively large.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Yarn Flower and Yarn Market Steady <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains calm and weak. Due to the overall downturn, poor environment, and falling raw material prices, speculators are selling off, Japanese merchants are selling, and Cantonese merchants are also closing out positions. However, actual sales have been maintained recently, and some Sichuan merchants are relatively bullish. Therefore, there are still many who want to go long, and a major player is still engaging in frequent trading. As for the overseas flower and yarn situation, it is still in a state of despair. The local situation will not escape the predicament of hovering for the time being. Significant changes are expected to occur after the delivery of this month.</p>
<p>People's Standard Slightly Brisk: The People's Standard market opened with a slight increase in extra cotton. There were fewer sellers in the market, but the telegraphs for third-grade yarn indicated a downward trend, with each month increasing by 1.23 cash. The afternoon was uneventful due to another drop in gold prices, with each month remaining flat. The total transaction volume was 21,300 bales. It was found that the sales included 4,700 bales from Gongtai, 600 bales from Xincheng, and 500 bales from Shenchang. The purchases included 2,650 bales from Meiji, 900 bales from Tongyu, and 1,700 bales from Guangfeng. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>October 152.6 193800</p>
<p>January 153.0 Down 1 69500</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Still Good: Spot yarn is still good. It was found that the total number of bales purchased by various merchants throughout the day was 1,700 bales, including 270 bales from the same trade. Among the out-of-town merchants, Sichuan merchants purchased 1,120 bales, inland merchants purchased 260 bales, and miscellaneous merchants purchased 250 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Cotton Market Turns from Promising to Withered <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market started firm but then fell. American cotton rose slightly by over ten pounds, but Dongyang third-grade cotton fell back. The talk that the United States would ban cotton planting next year, which was mentioned the previous day, is feared to be unlikely to materialize. People's confidence has weakened again. However, most local cotton merchants have a strong desire to go long because of the upcoming holiday season, the importance of the weather, and the fact that prices are already low. Unexpectedly, gold prices fell sharply in the afternoon. Japanese merchants, seeing the worsening situation, sold off one after another. According to Japanese merchant sources, there is talk of a second production of American cotton of about 16 million bales. As a result, the market situation has slightly loosened, but the competition among foreign firms is extremely fierce, and prices are very low. The future situation is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Moves Downstream: The Hankou Standard market opened firm in the morning with strong buying interest. Due to the slight increase in American cotton and concerns about stormy weather, each month rose by two cash. Later, due to unfavorable news, prices fell slightly. As a result, distant months rose by 0.5 to 1 cash, while near months fell by 2 cash. Upon hearing that gold prices had fallen sharply in the afternoon, Japanese merchants sold off, and the market sentiment weakened greatly. Each month fell by 2 to 4 cash. The total transaction volume was 95,300 dan. It was found that the sales included 2,000 dan from Changli, 2,900 dan from Shenji, 2,500 dan from Ruida, 2,100 dan from Tianlong, 2,000 dan from Mingde, 2,800 dan from Gongtai, 2,000 dan from Dafeng, 2,200 dan from Meiji, and 1,500 dan from Xincheng. The purchases included 3,900 dan from Yuanda, 2,400 dan from Lichang, 2,000 dan from Changfeng, and 1,900 dan from Daji. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>The Bombay market was quiet last week, with prices falling slightly by 5 rupees following American cotton. According to exporters and manufacturers, Indian cotton seems more expensive than American cotton, so trading is quite slow. The local market price, since the publication of the all-India cotton field forecast, was particularly firm due to the bullish factors. However, it was soon overturned by unfavorable news from overseas. Spot trading was quiet and uneventful. It is doubtful whether Japanese and European exporters can trade at the current market prices. The following is a summary of last week's statistics (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1930 1931</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts from September 1st 3464 3391</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 745 588</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports from September 1st 2575 2489</p>
<p>Exports to Europe 927 595</p>
<p>Exports to China 456 462</p>
<p>Exports to Japan 1130 1404</p>
<p>Other Regions 12 28</p>
<p>Spot sales in Liverpool were very strong last week. On the futures side, apart from a slight improvement on Wednesday and Thursday due to renewed rumors of tariffs, the bearish sentiment of short sellers remained unchanged, and there were very few buyers. The market was slightly firm at the end of the week due to short covering, but the unstable political situation discouraged public buying. The Egyptian cotton market was calm and firm.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Grain and Rice Prices Slightly Weak <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Arrivals in the South City yesterday were slightly sluggish, while stocks in the district remained tight. Transactions between urban and rural shops were stagnant again. Due to the stability of the Xin Zha market and the large accumulation of goods, people's confidence was weak, and transactions were not as good as before. Sellers had to soften their stance due to the weakening sales market. Early rice prices fell by another dime, and late rice sales were even more sluggish. Market prices also continued to decline due to abundant supply, with medium-grade rice falling even more sharply. According to the situation of early and late rice, prices have been declining sharply in recent days, and arrivals are becoming scarcer. Although there is not much premium Luxiang pointed rice, only top-grade materials are selected, resulting in a fatigued decline.</p>
<p>The source of goods for various merchants in Xin Zha is still thin, and there is still a large amount of accumulated cargo in the river. In terms of transactions in the city, shops are purchasing inventory of late rice the most due to the light rain. Prices are high for fixed-price goods but weak for other grades. Although the source of thick japonica rice from Suzhou, Changzhou, Yixing, and Jiangyin is small, transactions are quiet, and prices have not risen or fallen. Although there is not much premium Yanglu pointed rice, only the freshest is selected. The market presents a mediocre state. Due to insufficient sources of goods and good sales, the situation in Bianyin Yuan Yuan is slightly weaker. New japonica rice arrivals and sales are evenly matched, and prices remain unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Foreign Firms Peddling Small-Grain Rice <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The foreign rice market situation yesterday was still not improving, because various merchants had no need for it, and customers in need were mostly blocked by floods, making transportation impossible. Local digestion is good, but the daily arrival of lower-grade rice from the river is increasing, and prices are also falling, so there is no attention paid to foreign rice. Previously, there was interest in medium-grain rice, but there have been no further inquiries recently. However, foreign firms received telegrams from abroad stating that small-grain rice shipped in September was priced at 6.55 taels. The merchants immediately tried to peddle it in the market, but importers believed that the Shanghai standard price of 13-14 yuan was too expensive and remained on the sidelines, with no transactions. There are also no transactions in spot goods. The total floating inventory in the market is about 30,000 units, while speculators and local buyers have about 100,000 units. There is no floating inventory of guest Xian rice in the market, but speculators and local buyers still hold about 10,000 to 20,000 bags. The other day, 4,200 bags of late Jiangxi machine rice were sold for 13.5 to 13.12 yuan, also within the control of Zhongguan cargo.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Flour Prices Loosen and Fall <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The market has been stepping back this month.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month generally showed a loosening and falling trend, with quotations for foreign wheat continuing to fall by about 0.2 to 0.4 yuan. Most people believe that the American wheat famine in China must succeed, given the circumstances. The foreign wheat already ordered by various factories is sufficient to meet current actual sales. With each additional 10% completed, they feel that their chips are getting bigger, so the psychology of most people is gloomy. This month's delivery is imminent, and the transaction volume on the exchange is said to be around 2 million bags, mostly by outsiders, with very few actual sales, resulting in a gradual decline in recent days and a downward trend. Distant months are also being dragged down due to weak buying interest. As a result, this month fell by 1.5 points compared to the previous week, September fell by 1.25 points, October/November fell by 1.5 points, December fell by 1 point, and January fell by 0.75 points.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Wheat Futures Market Weak Near, Firm Distant <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, presented a situation of weakness in the near months and stability in the distant months. The near month is approaching delivery, and many outsiders are gradually selling off, while manufacturers have no intention to buy, so the market inevitably fell. The distant months were relatively stable because inland merchants were either closing out their near-term positions or buying into distant months. As a result, this month was slightly down by 1 point compared to the previous day, September/October were up by 2 points, November was up by 1 point, December was up by 2 points, and January was up by 1 point. The spot wheat market is gradually becoming quiet. Arrivals are not moving, and sales are limited. The whole market opened with Yangzhou wheat at 3.7472 yuan and cooked wheat at 3.82 yuan, totaling 1,200 bags, which were handled by Fuxin Huafeng.</p>

<p>Taikoo Sugar Turns Strong After Falling</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from producing areas indicated that the markets in Cuba, New York, and Java were very quiet with no trading sessions held by market associations. The initial price of Dutch 24-grade raw white sugar was 11.6 taels, but there was a shortage of sellers. The market later rose to 11.65 taels, and the market sentiment was still strong. 20-grade medium white sugar was 11.1 taels, Cuban ocean sugar was 10.01 taels, and bowl blue was 8.7 taels, and the market was stable. Sales of Taikoo sugar were very scarce. Furthermore, with the exchange rate turning higher, people's confidence weakened, and the market turned down. B-mark was 12.05 taels, DY-mark was 11.875 taels, HX-mark was 11.7 taels, AM-mark was 11.45 taels. Buyers were still active, and the market was tight. Taikoo O25 opened yesterday at 9.4 taels per 100 bags. Huaxin sold 200 bags of slightly oily goods at 9.1 taels. The company also offered oily bag number 10 Dutch red at 696 bags for 9.55 yuan. Zhenxiang sold 1,500 bags of number 9 Dutch red at 9.6 taels, and the market was quite firm.</p>
<h3 id="e179">An Overview of the Piece Goods Market <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market has undergone tremendous changes since the boycott. The sluggishness of sales is unprecedented. However, the severe floods in various provinces are also a major reason. In previous years at this time, autumn sales would have begun, and buyers would have flocked in. This year, however, it is as rare as morning stars. Chinese piece goods once saw an increase, but now they are also lifeless. East goods have been suspended for a long time due to strict inspections, and the Yangtze River basin is also stagnant, so the downward trend is quite fierce, with a tendency to plummet. This is because the goods ordered in August have gradually arrived in Shanghai, but actual sales have stopped. Merchants are urging delivery very urgently, so they have to sell them at a loss, resulting in considerable losses. Inventory of West goods is extremely scarce, and even when there are comparable goods, the asking prices are surprisingly high and difficult to sell, so they are also completely immobile. The piece goods industry has always regarded autumn as a major sales period. Given the situation this year, it is feared that it will be difficult to develop in the future. Yesterday, the coarse cloth market also fell sharply, with Jubaopen 9-pound cloth at 4.85 taels, Cat Wufu at 4.5 taels, and Santu Sanlu 11-pound cloth at 5.5 taels. 13-pound cloth was also down by 0.05 yuan. However, Wannianqing fine cloth was quite brisk, with Lixu at 9.45 taels. The price of fine cloth from Japanese factories has fallen by 0.02-0.03 yuan in recent days. The production of fine Chinese serge, gabardine, and tribute cloth has gradually increased, but the sentiment of customers is quite soft, so there is no excitement.</p>

<p>— Zimei</p>
<p>Written by Wang Zhuangfei…Published by Shanghai Qin Fen Bookstore</p>
<p>The sparseness of our country's sports publications is a vivid reflection of the immaturity of the sports industry, and it is also the reason for the immaturity of the sports industry. Among these sparse sports publications, especially those on social sports, we have rarely seen one. The seeming progress but lack of advancement of social sports is not surprising.</p>
<p>Recently, an "echo in the empty valley" appeared. The "Sports Field Guide" was published by Qin Fen Bookstore at No. 39 Xinmin Village, Malong Road, Shanghai. After reading it, there are indeed many insightful arguments, and the methods are all practical. It is truly a well-intentioned original work, making a significant contribution to our country's social sports.</p>
<p>Wang Zhuangfei, the author of the Sports Field Guide, has more than ten years of experience in managing the Shanghai Public Sports Field. He has been diligently working hard and never making any comments. Therefore, we only know him as a doer, not a theorist. In fact, words and actions are mutually supportive. Those who can do it can also speak it. Perhaps Mr. Wang's silence in the past was because his research had not yet reached a certain stage, and he was unwilling to publish it easily.</p>
<p>In his introduction, the author discusses the reasons for the poor performance of public sports fields in our country, pinpointing two points: (1) Each sports field has too little funding; (2) Most people have no spare time. His conclusion is, "To compensate for these two shortcomings, we must make the majority of people aware of the danger of the decline of social sports and have the desire to work together for construction. Not only the education authorities should do this, but the first and second chapters of this book repeatedly focus on the effectiveness of social sports and the needs of public sports fields, for nothing more than this."</p>
<p>He also has some very sincere words regarding the implementation of social sports: "I am confident that there is no fixed method for managing a public sports field. To be loyal to the task, to strive to increase the number of people exercising, and to complete the effectiveness of sports, how to realize the ideal, how to eliminate obstacles, always pay attention and be constantly mindful. All very practical methods will come spontaneously. Sticking to established methods is not feasible." Therefore, his implementation methods are entirely based on experience and provide a faithful report, as detailed in Chapters 3 to 8, without exaggeration or secrecy, covering all the content.</p>
<p>(1) In terms of theory, enthusiastically call on the majority of people to work hard on the construction of social sports—Chapters 1 and 2.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of methods, faithfully report more than ten years of experience in managing sports fields, for everyone's reference—Chapters 3 to 8.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 is "School Sports and Social Sports." Its main point is to clarify that the importance of social sports is no less than that of school sports, and that school sports must be carried out in conjunction with social sports to be effective. There are several thought-provoking words in it: "...Looking at the overall picture, in terms of merit and practical examination, I dare to say that sports is a necessary education in life, and it is also an education that cannot be lacking for a single day. Humans have differences in gender, age, intelligence, strength, wealth... The need for sports is the same. At most, it is just a change in quantity and method. Because a healthy body, a sharp mind, a happy spirit, useful skills, and a mentality and habits that adapt to the environment, whether you are male or female, young or old, intelligent or foolish, strong or weak, rich or poor... are all urgently needed now or in the future, that is, the statutes and detailed rules of the playground for children, the "Construction and Equipment" chapter, lists the construction equipment that should be available in various sports fields, constantly and continuously seeking. The degree of connection is not much different from the relationship between water and fish, and sunshine and rain to flowers and trees. Therefore, having sports within the school and no sports outside the school is fundamentally untenable. School sports being more important than social sports, and discussing social sports after completing school sports, is also an unreasonable proposition." His conclusion is, "The establishment of public sports fields must not be missing in the entire education plan, especially in China, where emphasis on literature and neglect of martial arts has become a habit."</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, the most valuable part of the entire book is Chapter 3, "Strategies for Managing Public Sports Fields." With a clear vision, the author decisively reveals the strategies for managing sports fields: (1) To get the majority of people to come to the field to exercise; (2) To make the people who come to the field to exercise develop a strong interest; (3) To enable people who enjoy exercising to achieve the most perfect sports effects. I think the facilities of public sports fields and social sports, despite the thousands of ways they can be, cannot escape these three goals. If even one point is mistaken, there is a danger of going astray. Therefore, attracting a few athletes to support the facade is not a good sports field. People come and go, tasting briefly, and that is not a good sports field either. Although the sports field is very lively, it is just blindly doing things without enabling each individual to have a courageous and healthy body, a happy spirit, and a modest attitude, and that is not a good sports field either. In other words, residents near the sports field should all come to the sports field, those who have a fixed time to exercise should come to the sports field every day, and over time, they will all become strong and promising talents, as if cast from a model. At this point, the public sports field will not fail its mission. If sports fields are widely established throughout our country, and each sports field reaches this standard, then social stability, national consolidation, and the rise of the nation will inevitably occur.</p>
<p>Comrades who manage sports fields, do not be discouraged, thinking that the obstacles in front of you are too great to follow the goals and move forward. You must know that for every effort you put in, there is a corresponding effect. With a corresponding effect, there is trust from a segment of the population. With trust from a segment of the population, you will get assistance from part of the population. From near to far, accumulate small amounts to make a large amount. When outsiders trust and the effectiveness is great, all obstacles can be turned into nothing. Therefore, I wholeheartedly agree with the three goals proposed by the author.</p>
<p>The following chapters on "Organization," "Construction and Equipment," "Opening," "Management," and "Work" can be said to be all means to achieve these three goals. Because the author's writing is based on experience everywhere, faithfully reporting, secretly using arguments to alert key points, and the steps are well-organized. What is particularly wonderful is that each chapter lists specific examples to clearly show methods. For example, the "Organization" chapter lists the construction and equipment methods of public sports fields and simple sports equipment, and the architectural equipment methods, all with drawings, clear dimensions. The "Opening" chapter lists the timetable for opening the various sports fields and various parts. The "Management" chapter lists the regulations for entry, field rental, item borrowing, item deposit, bathing, swimming, etc., as well as procedures for field cleaning, equipment inspection, and worker deployment. The "Work" chapter divides the programs into performances, lectures, slogans, publications, equipment, organizing competitions, guiding encouragement... all with very detailed and concrete methods that can teach people to follow the diagram. In these many substantial reports, I am convinced that the author still does not lose his true colors as a practitioner.</p>
<p>I dare not say that the Sports Guide is a perfect and flawless social sports book, but I dare say that it is a pioneer in our country's research on social sports. From this, we can recognize and solve problems such as what a public sports field is, why a public sports field is established, and how a public sports field should be managed.</p>
<p>For such useful books, personnel managing sports administration and students specializing in sports should have a copy in hand. Even those who study education and care about social issues should read it carefully.</p>

<p>Wang Juncaiyun, a native of Fenghua, Zhejiang, had great ambitions from a young age. At the age of ten, he came to Shanghai to engage in commerce. He initially founded the Rongchangxiang Woolen Goods Store and also engaged in other businesses. He was enthusiastic about public welfare and enjoyed doing good deeds. For example, the founding of the orphanage in his hometown county was largely due to Wang's efforts. He also possessed perseverance in social matters, such as initiating the Joint Association of Business Circles from Various Roads and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to seek benefits for the Chinese people. Following the painful May Thirtieth Massacre, he vowed not to deal in foreign goods, ceased his business, and returned to his hometown. Now, he came to Shanghai for business and resided at Rongchangxiang, but he suddenly passed away yesterday morning due to a stroke. Relatives, party members, old friends, and acquaintances all deeply lamented his passing.</p>
<p>The Aihua Pharmaceutical Company on Wangping Street announced that the one and only dried vegetable bamboo shoots, a specialty of Yuyao, managed by their company, are clean, fresh, delicious, and beneficial to health. They are the only exquisite side dish for meals in summer and autumn. Now, as the factory celebrates its sixth anniversary, they are giving away gifts such as round fans and picture cards, which will end on the 25th of this month. Therefore, wholesale and retail sales have been even more prosperous than before.</p>
