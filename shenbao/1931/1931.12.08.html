<p>决議案附日本剿匪權聲明　　我國將提偏重法理之保留</p>
<p>日軍沿齊克路向馬部進迫</p>
<p>北平學生二千餘南下請願</p>
<h3>國聯起草會聽取中日意見</h3>
<p>施肇基準備接受决議案</p>
<p>日本同意另附聲明辦法</p>
<p>（巴黎）一般人士以爲滿案爭端今已有早日解决希望、今晨施博士語起草委員會、謂渠所接南京政府之訓令、已使其可以接受照目下方式之行政會决議案、惟如有任何修正、而爲其所接訓令中所未包括者、則渠當、示於南京、渠所接關於錦州現狀之最近解釋、爲錦州華兵並未增援、亦無進攻之意志云、起草委員會認中立區域爲緊急問題、但今晨集議時、並未考慮關於此事之切實建議、白里安今日將晤芳澤、聞芳澤今日可接到東京政府關於國聯决議案所未解决各點之切實訓令、聞剿匪問題現已議定、可不列入議案或導言中、芳澤對於此事、將作特别之保留、現又有人建議議案第五條與調查委員團職權有關而爲日本所反對者、將移列於導言中、但其文字仍未完全商妥、又聞芳澤將於今日提出關於錦州中立區域及其地位之切實建議、日本代表團今午宴待行政會十二會員、及其主要顧問、施博士亦被請、但未赴宴、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於滿洲問題解决之方案、今日因日本方面意見紛歧、故國聯理事會於起草决議案之工作上、毫無進展、中國總代表施肇基辭職消息所造成之恐怖、今似已成過去、今日理事會起草委員會與日代表團法律顧問伊藤、對於决議案第五欵繼續討論、據云、日本代表團仍不允國聯調查委員團與日本撤兵問題併作一談、惟伊藤已將國聯之態度報告本國政府、并希望能於二十四小時内接得東京之新訓令、國聯方面深恐日本將决議草案完全推翻、但望東京方面能相機而動、對於中立調查團及日軍剿匪自由等項、作相當之讓步、此亦非絶對不可能之事也、理事會起草委員會兹復定於星期一晨、與中國總代表施肇基晤談、因施氏已新自南京接得訓令也（六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）起草委員會今日與伊藤晤商、從午後三時半起、至四時三刻止、所商之主要點、爲議案第五段與調查團職權有關者之文字、日本所提出調查團如由下屆行政會會議囑其報告日本撤兵事、得繕具此種報告之建議、起草委員會認爲不能接受、因其限制調查團職權也、經再討論後、另建議一種方案、但未有决定、至於芳澤在公開會議時得宣佈日本自由剿匪權一事、未曾議及、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）伊藤昨提出形式含混之建議、謂行政院對於調查團之使命、與其在目前作决議、毋寗俟下次常會時加以考慮、蓋在中間時期以内、調查團當已達到滿洲、一切情由自可完全明瞭、而該團有益處之任務、自易妥爲决定云云、（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今晨十一時起草委員會重行開會、以聽取施肇基之意見、中立區域問題似未談到、施氏與委員會僅談及議决草案及行政院主席宣言、據本社所知、施氏雖受愛國分子重大壓迫、仍可承認議决案、惟將提出若干保留、此項保留、與其謂爲注重實際、毋寗謂爲偏重法理、然則關於决議案之協定、終必成立、午後三時半白里安將接見芳澤、十二委員會當於五時開會（七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據此間負責方面消息、日政府準備接受國聯行政會所發日本應另行聲明以保留其在滿洲剿匪權之建議惟須附以中國不得提出對案、以取銷日本此項權利之條件、日政府又决定依允伊藤所提議關於調查團職權之方案、上述兩事、乃國聯議案中須徵求日本同意之點、日政府訓令今夜可發往巴黎、（七日路透社電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）今日公佈之錦州英視察員報告、謂錦州除日飛機飛來偵視外、狀况如常、通遼自日軍撤退後、各事亦如常態、日軍留百人駐凌河口、以衛新民而防匪患、北寗路英職員現監督饒陽河附近修橋工程云、今晚發表之另一英員備忘錄、謂遼河以西有日兵三百、巡邏北寗路綫、自稱匪衆活動、故有此舉、但英視察員則未見有匪衆活動之證據也云、法視察員報告、自上次報告後、事態毫無變更北寗路車現漸照常行駛、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日前英國政府報告行政院、謂有日本人四百名、正式用瀋陽總領事館義勇隊名義、業已到達哈爾濱、兹由日本代表團報告國聯會、謂爲錯誤、據云、該處英國總領事館并未接有此項消息云、此項報告署名者係日本國聯代表辦事處處長、（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>施肇基否認被毆受傷</h3>
<p>（巴黎）今日此間有驚人傳說、謂施博士爲中國學生毆擊、面部受傷云云、此說全無根據、今晨路透訪員往謁施博士、施否認被毆事、施現略感寒疾、並無被毆之顯跡、面部亦無傷痕、（七日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>學生愛國運動平議</h3>
<p>九月十八以來日軍加諸我國之暴行。以及國際聯盟對我極端不公平之判斷而感。凡有熱血之國民决難忍受决不能坐視。以此種事實之刺激更益以我外交上之步步陷於失敗地位正義潛銷。魔鬼晝行。亡國之禍。迫在眉睫。於是而感覺敏鋭。意志純潔。而又血氣方剛之學生靑年。乃嘩然奮起。七旬以來。全國靑年在同一目標之下。罷課遊行。請願示威。斷指投軍。甚至自殺。使國内空氣。頓形緊張。此種激越之民氣。充分顯示我古國之民族精神尚未死盡。在「不許抵抗」之環境下。而尚有此激越悲壯之舉動。吾人蓋不能不承認我民族之一綫生命。應其在斯。</p>
<p>今日國内輿論。對於學生此種悲壯行爲之觀察與批評極不一致或爲同情。或爲惋惜。或爲厭惡。甚且視爲洪水猛獸。爲國家法紀所不容。惟自吾人觀之。究以爲目前學生靑年之奔走追呼。疾聲呼籲。雖以事實之剌激與反應。而偶有逸出正軌外之錯誤。而其情則可原。其行則可敬。其艱苦卓絶之泣血呼籲。則可歌可泣吾人應予以絶對之同情絶對之諒解厭惡固不可。視爲洪水猛獸。則更非所宜。</p>
<p>寇深矣。國危矣。環觀國内。尚有如學生之慷慨激昂不避艱辛爲國難而奔走追呼者乎老成者持鎭靜。消極者作旁觀。怯葸者則更甘屈服。外患日益迫近。外交日現失利此時我國家旣未可以武力與强暴相爭持。則以激昻之民氣。作政府與外交有力之後盾。并昭示世界以我民族不屈於强暴之奮鬥精神。此種行動實爲有五千年歷史之民族所應有。設并此消極之抗爭而亦無之。舉國鎭靜死寂無聲吾人但一閉目設想。此復成何國家。在國難方亟之秋。正恐國民之不肯負責。而今乃對於學生之悲壯行爲。加以非笑與厭惡。甚且加以疑慮與猜忌。吾人不能不承認此爲最足惋惜之現象。設使厭惡學生者。今日而亦爲純潔勇敢之學生。處於今日時危勢急情勢之下。其遂能視若秦越人之肥瘠。漠然毫無喜戚乎。國至今日。外迫强敵内困洪　。使學生不能安心於所事。而不得不疾聲呼號喚起國人自救。此種可悲可痛之現象。除愈益堅定吾人反抗强暴奮鬭自救之决心而外。更有何話可說。</p>
<p>據文官處與中央宣傳部之宣示。皆謂目前學生種種逸出軌外之行爲。皆由於誤信謡傳對政府誤會果如是固爲吾人所深欣幸。然而以如此嚴重之外交問題而我國内一切消息都仰賴於外電之傳遞。任其以訛傳訛。我外交情勢。又不公開。使舉國人民都陷於迷離恍惚之濃霧中驚惶錯愕。不可終朝。是則學生目彰之有此錯誤行爲。當局者似亦不能辭咎。靑年爲社會之中堅。爲我國家他日之柱石。如吾人視今日之靑年如洪水猛獸。不可親近。則我國家之最近將來。尚堪問乎故吾人認爲處於今日情勢之下予學生以極端之同情接納學生之誠意。導之入於有效奮鬥之正軌則可厭惡則不可。視爲洪水猛獸則更不可。</p>
<p>抑吾人有不能不向學生諸君摯誠陳辭者國處今日艱難已達極巔吾人具有愛國之熱忱。尤應認淸奮鬥之目標。今日我民族之最大敵人爲日本帝國主義者。吾人應認淸當前之大敵。以一致之步調。衝向敵人之營壘絶不容混亂步伍趨入歧途。以破壞整個戰綫。此其一救國之道在於有效之奮鬥。在於人盡其職大好之精神。與寳貴之學業。實不容輕易犧牲。在準備犧牲之前。應須估量其所得之代價。故此後之行動應加以充分之考慮。務求其不徒然犧牲。而毫無補於實際。此其二國至今日百孔千瘡。禍機潛伏匪伊一朝。欲救此瘡痍滿目之古國固非一蹴所能成功。必持久奮鬥。終始勿懈持其志而不暴其氣。有其初而亦持其終人人以堅苦卓絶之精神準備作長時間之奮鬥。欲長時間奮鬥。不能不有賴於學問。國家前　　其得救此其三。蓋求學爲學生之本分救國固重。求學亦重。即國破家亡。而「最後一課。」亦應終讀。目前東北學生。多團結數人各飮苦水一杯。自勵自矢。不與日人合作。堅决反抗强暴。同時亦刻苦自修。不放棄救國之基本學問。此種行爲最足效法。若。多作無代價之犧牲則用心雖苦。而收效實微。此則我舉國靑年所應理解認淸者也。</p>

<p>齊克路之我軍佈置日軍沿齊克路攻進數次、悉未得手、日前退集齊齊哈爾黑軍騎兵第一線、乃進駐於塔哈爾河、（距黑垣四十五里爲齊克一小站）在該方者、爲程志遠旅第五十四團涂全勝部、第二線爲寗年站與富海站之間、距泰安鎭百二十里、距塔哈爾河七十里、在此地者、爲程志遠旅第五十二團朱鳳陽部、第三線爲泰安鎭與鰲龍溝之間、距克山縣城四十五里、在此地者、爲程旅五十三團周作霖部、吳松林旅第三團王克鎭部、總預備隊騎兵吳旅第四團沙力佈、第二團劉斌兩部、駐在克山縣、所有黑軍騎兵主力、均佈置於齊克沿線、馬氏爲指揮便利計、委程志遠爲騎兵總指揮、吳松林爲副總指揮、總指揮部設於克山縣、騎兵純採游擊性、不挖戰壕、不拘防線、無事互相聯絡、有事一舉而前、董齊克路線泰安鎭以上、仍多平原、作戰騎兵、較爲得力、無險可守、挖壕築壘、殊非重要、自鰲龍溝以下斜出至拜泉、由步兵苑旅擔任、第一團劉宏萱部駐鰲龍附近與騎兵聯絡、第二三團李趙兩部駐拜泉、步兵第三旅與騎兵第一團徐靑山部、爲海倫拜泉克山間聯絡隊、駐雙陽鎭、步三旅李靑山部駐雙陽鎭、爲預備隊、補充團周興祺部、衛隊團徐寳貞部、駐海倫、衛戍當地、步二旅蘇炳文部吳玉書之第四團、回駐海拉爾、防範内蒙、步一旅張殿九部孫鴻玉之第三團、回駐富拉爾基、防範景星方面、當十九日黑軍退却時、以倉卒奉命退却、遂未能集中一地、其由齊克路沿線退却者、因有後方軍隊之掩護、未遭敵軍襲擊、隊伍亦未紊亂、其奉命令較晚、并因敵方以坦克車飛機衝擊、乃致隊伍星散、此以步兵爲甚、故退却之方向、亦未能悉如馬氏之指定、由海倫附近繞越尋覓本管團隊所在者、頗不在少、有不得旅團駐所之小部隊伍、乃紛至其他旅團、要求改編、所以各旅團隊面目猶昔、實質已易、暫編步兵第一旅苑崇穀部、原有三團、以十八日擔任三間房正面、退却稍遲、七千餘健兒、死傷之外、收容至現在、祇得第一團劉宏萱部二千人、若李團趙團、僅到五六百人、原來砲兵一營、野砲九門、所餘只三門、其餘六門、已遺漏於陣地、實力之減少、差逾兩倍、步兵第三旅馬占山部徐靑山之第一團騎兵、騎餘四百、李靑山之步兵第五團、收容至六百、步兵第一旅張殿九部孫鴻寳之第三團、收容到七百、步兵第二旅蘇炳文部吳玉書之第四團、收容至九百、步兵補充團周興祺部、收容至七百、步兵衛隊團徐寳貞部收容至四百、騎兵第八旅程志遠部、收容至四千、騎兵第一旅吳松林部、收容至三千、總計各旅團隊、收容至現在共萬一千名、較戰前相差五分之二、各旅團隊槍砲、多半作戰過力、或爆炸廢棄、或以馬四被炸斃、不及拖運出陣地、即騎兵所乘馬匹、亦多傷斃、故補充整理、均須相當時間、</p>
<p>新編民團槍械缺乏新編之各縣民團、因槍械彈藥兩缺、雖各縣已有編成者、實際則尚無辦法、故頃正計畫徵收民械、黑東各縣民團、如綏</p>

<p>三間房戰敗之要因愚於二十七日晚八時、訪馬占山主席於廣信湧内、承啟處啟達後、即延入馬氏所居之東跨院内、時外室中坐滿軍政要人、馬氏猶在室内會客、少選客去、承啟禀白、遂遜愚入、馬氏着灰湖縐羊裘、靑花緞棉履、面頰瘦削、軀幹中人、蓄八字鬚、襯以有光之兩目、威稜逼人、蓋一神彩奕奕短小精悍之丈夫也、見愚入、起立中堂、微笑讓坐、不待叩問、即謂此次未能打好、勞君遠道存問、愧甚我軍之退此、不過避難一時、一俟計劃妥定、將遷往他處、詢以此次致敗之主因、馬氏蹙額而言曰、我軍之所以敗退、三間房無地形、非用武之區、平原一片、無險阻之可守、當初日軍逼我時、我軍稍退、致失大興江橋之險要、余於十一月六日至前方督師反攻、因援應不繼、未能一鼓過江、收復江橋、不得已、乃以三間房爲陣地、明知不易扼守、顧猶冀支持至十一月十六日、以爲國聯决案、能發生效力、則日軍或少存顧忌、不來侵逼、孰意敵軍悍然不顧一切、大舉進攻、致我軍難以固守、此失利之原因一、三間房湯池等地、爲沙磧區域、我軍戰壕、難築堅固、敵軍以坦克車重砲環攻、戰壕遂爲毁平、我軍隊不能固守壕内、此失利之原因二、我軍作戰、騎兵爲多、顧黑省精鋭、均調往關内、所餘悉老弱之卒、無大戰經騐、復不能團成一片、致敵砲火得以發揮其威力、專擇隊伍密集處轟擊、於是騎兵旣失却聯絡、陣線乃致動摇、此失利之原因三、自作戰以來、無援無彈、我軍砲火器械、本來不如敵之犀利、尤以敵軍以重砲排比來攻、自三十里距離處、即可轟射我陣線、我軍所備之野砲、射力最遠不過十五里、敵發重砲、我之野砲遂覺無用、兵士苦戰十餘日、伏處戰壕内、晝夜不敢闔目、敵軍又以我軍旣無援軍替換、遂時以小隊來擾、疲我士卒、且敵又專向我軍輩薄處攻擊、此爲失利之原因四、余在十七晚戰事激烈時、擬悉調哈滿線其他步兵兩團加入前方、詎兩團尚未開到、敵軍即用坦克車掩護、擊破我之右翼、此爲失和之原因五、如果余有相當兵力、早已反攻、不待敵軍之猛擊我軍之死守也、兵士中有畏敵者、余誥誡之、以日兵亦係一人、我亦係一人、人與人何畏懼之有、飛機來投炸彈、宜散臥仰射、勿惶駭、勿走避、旣在戰線、何得有安全地帶、故士兵遵余訓誨、方同仇敵愾、抗敵多日、當前方緊急時、張長官（景惠）來電話數次、謂無論如何、兵士先退、秀芳（馬字）你可不退、留在省城、與日方晤面、談一辦法、余答以四爺（景惠）爲東北之老長官、命令烏敢不聽、惟馬占山自信係一好男兒、絶不降日本、四爺如降日本、則人各有志、不必相强、如四爺受日本委託來黑主政、吾在原則上不反攻、但須左右無日人、如仍用日本人充顧問等、或日兵仍駐省城、則四爺等於投降日本、占山亦以敵人一律對付、盡我力量、以相周旋、其後、我軍退至此處、張長官（景惠）派代表二人來見余（按爲張蘭鈞李含川）求余諒解、并述不得已赴黑之原因、余仍答覆如前、且告以四爺如不受日人支配、則吾甘願聽受一切命令、否則爲亡國奴支配下之亡國奴、吾絶不幹、吾惟有拚命到底、兩代表赧然而去、聞在呼海車中、遭盡旅客之唾駡、是亦可見民氣未盡銷沉也、談至此、以時已晏、馬氏掾屬候命請示者復多、乃道别歸寓、</p>
<p>馬占山之堅决表示二十八日午後二時許、愚再度往訪馬占山主席、通報後即延見、時馬氏正向第三旅副官長李顯章指示一事、因得惻聽其事爲駐安達站張殿九部焦團長來電、云有土匪千餘、集合於安廣大賚間、要求改編、馬氏令</p>

<p>罷課情形昨日起全市五十餘中學、均奉中校聯會命令、實行罷課、惟務本啟秀大同三校、因事前未曾得訉、故未罷課、各校抗日會、并令學生罷課後、不得荒愈嬉戲、每日仍須到校、從事救國工作、</p>

<h3>工部局修正補助私校章程之用意（續昨）</h3>
<p>敎育委員會某委員、又引述費唐法官之報告中之意見、謂工部局對於唱導國際惡感之學校、不宜予以補助、現今之規定此條文、即欲避免此種情形、查費唐氏之報告有曰「關於工部局管理其所立各學校、及輔助其他國立或私立學校、余意須有一項條件、倘加入無論何項施行新敎育政策約規内、足以維護租界全體之利益、此條件即凡有管理工部局所立學校之計畫、或補助私立學校之計畫、其學校無論爲外人學校或華人學校、皆不得有引起國際間及民族間互相仇視之敎課是也、試一觀現今若干學校中所用之敎</p>
<p>科書、則此項條件實不可認爲過慮、夫公共租界之基礎、爲國際合作、非但外人與外人之合作、亦爲外人與華人之合作、工部局旣係由各國人之代表組織而成、爲各方共同之利益而執行職務、如果有意的或默許的支用其捐稅之一部分、供給某種學校、同時各該校乃敎其各國籍之學童、使彼此互視爲歷史傳統的敵人、或以仇恨他國之人視爲國民之最大責任、此其不當、豈不甚乎、工部局中之國際合作不能根基於學校中之國際仇恨、故凡反對某一國或某數國之宣傳、皆應禁之、雖事實上、此項禁令、未必能確實充分施行、而此原則旣經公衆承認、則已足爲一種保障、而爲趨向正途之一大步驟也」</p>
<p>現在此項正條文、旣成爲工部局敎育方針之一部分、則所費之討論、可謂有圓滿之效果、此項規定、無論何國國籍之學校、皆望其尊守也、</p>
<p>上述問題旣經解决、工部局遂以敎育委員會之建議、函致上海市長張羣將軍如左、</p>
<p>「敬啟者、上次納稅人會議、准由敝局撥欵、對於界内私立學校之敎授完善及經費不足者、予以補助、籍以發展界内居民兒童之敎育、此項補助費之章程、今已擬定特奉上一份、按照該章程之規定、該項私立學校、須遵照其校内多數學童之本國敎育程度、而對於華人學校、並特爲聲明、應遵照中國政府之定章及標準、斯項補助費之發給、將依據敝局敎育委員員之華人委員分會之建議、而關於華人學校之選擇、該處甚望責市敎育局予以推薦、凡華人學校欲得補助者、似可令其直接向敎育局陳請、由敎育局長加以按語、轉送敝局敎育委員員、至凡經敎育局推薦之學校、或不能一一皆得補助金、其未經推薦之學校、有特殊情形者、亦或廳予以補助、惟敎育局長之意見、必由敝敎育委員會詳加考慮、敝局深信如能施行此項合作辦法、必能增進雙方互相之諒解及善意、甚望貴市長能予以同意及協助」關於施行敎育章程其内載有補助華人私立學校一事、在最近工部局董事會席上、有某董事陳述本局敎育委員會、願與中國敎育當局合作、以施行此項章程、彼稱該會各員一致主張、在本租界内之華人私立學校、應在可能範圍之内、盡量使之歸中國敎育當局之管轄、对與中國方面之合作基礎、已在董事會紀錄中詳爲記載、本此方針進行、固似有工部局不願管理華人學校之意、但敎育委員會之意、以爲旣有前述之保障條件、則此項政策必於中外居民互有裨益也、董事會對於該委員會所主張之政策、全體一致、予以採納云（完）</p>

<h3>五告讀者通訉諸君</h3>
<p>爲抵制日貨打開一條新生路</p>
<p>諸君來訉、關於抵制日貨者特多、有多人感於私進私售日貨之奸商、到處充斥、無從處置憤而來問辦法者、此類以内地爲尤多、請就此點貢我意見、</p>
<p>歷來、抵制仇貨、所最感處置困難者、就是奸商私進私售一問題、有人說、在全國同聲抗日憤激之下、尚有私進私售之奸商、此是宣傳勸導不力者之過、其論甚正、其事實難、以日本國民敎育之普及、而馬占山之軍械一部分、尚私購之於日本商人、明揭於大建日文報紙、可見商人重利輕義、到處皆然、此點如無適當解决方法、則抵貨之舉、眞是根本上行不通、</p>
<p>於是來訉提出種種主倀、有主查得後將貨焚毁者、有主將該奸商拘禁者、有主令游行以示辱者、最激烈者、主張明殺或暗殺、</p>
<p>世界進化至今日、列國並立、處處須着眼於國</p>

<p>際、欲在國際間所得地位、首在備具文明國家之資格、所謂文明國家、最少限度、須具有世界通行之法治組織、治者執行、被治者守法、取得各國同情、纔能取得國際間地位、上所云處置私售仇貨商辦法、痛快誠痛快矣、其如國法何、</p>
<p>欲不犯法、即無法處置私進仇貨商、即無法抵貨、即無法救國、奈何奈何、則請鄭重反省一下、眞愛國乎、眞欲救國乎、則惟有準備聽受法庭裁判、請將現行中華民國刑法摘錄如下、</p>
<p>第一五七條公然處罰施强暴脅迫者、在塲助勢之人、處一年以下有期徒刑、拘役、或三百元以下罰金、首謀及下手實施强暴脅迫者、處六月以上五年以下有期徒刑、</p>
<p>第二八六條、當塲激於義憤而殺人者、處一年以上七年以下有期徒刑、</p>
<p>第三一六條、私禁或以其他方法剝奪人之行動自由罪、處五年以上有期徒刑、拘役、或三百元以下罰金</p>
<p>第三一八條、以强暴脅迫使人行無義務之事或妨害人行使權利者、處三年以下有期徒刑、拘役、或三百元以下罰金、</p>
<p>現在各方處置私售仇貨商之普通辦法、其所觸犯之刑法、大概如右、</p>
<p>眞愛國乎、眞欲救國乎、何勿向法庭自首、</p>
<p>第三八條、對於未發覺之罪、自首於該管公務員、受裁判者、得減所首罪之刑三分之一、向被害人、告訴人、或有請求權之人、自首、而受該管公務員裁判者、亦同、</p>
<p>請更述一事實、</p>
<p>上海抗日會檢查科葛雲亭、楊海昌、施新民、居宗炎、檢查大慶紗布號、查昨十全牌紗布、送送封存、被捕房起訴於特區法院、刑庭長周翰、判葛等四人、共同以强暴脅迫使人行無義務之事、各處罰金二十元、緩刑二年、十一月二十六日本報、</p>
<p>此葛楊施居四先生、及法官周先生、均値得吾人起敬、眞爲救國、而檢查仇貨、如葛楊施居四先生、終可爲一般人模範、因其愛國而仍不廢國法也、依法判罪、念其犯罪之原因、出於愛國、旣從輕判、更予緩刑、如周先生、眞可爲一般法官模範、因其愛國而仍不廢國法也、</p>
<p>處置仇貨處置私售仇貨商而皆如此法官而皆如此、從此爲抵制仇貨打開一條新生路、於國民道德、於國家法律、何嘗有絲毫虧損乎、但有須鄭重聲明者調查須眞確、萬一誣害其人、無論出於故意或無心、皆爲法律所不容、爲道德所不許、</p>

<p>暴日踞蛉洲三島。儼然以東亞主人翁自尊。然一考其生聚之繁。風俗之壞。有非筆墨所能形容者。彼邦以櫻花爲國花。每當春季花開時。紅男綠女之嬉游於花下者。採蘭贈芍之韵事。時有所聞。友人朱君。固風度翩翩之慘綠少年也。游學東瀛。入法政學校垂二三年。課餘歸來。與逆旅主人之少女八尾子。嘘寒問暖。形影不離。由友誼而進爲鈿盒盟。綠窗問字。鴛鴦之顚倒難分。紅袖添香。鸞鳳之和鳴可卜。未幾而藍田種玉。居然一索得男。閨房之樂。有甚於劃眉者。何如得隴望蜀。又移愛於小娛。一箭雙雕。九尾子平分春色。逾年朱軍業歸國。彼娥愥竟追隨不捨。同蒞故鄉。洗手調羹。事翁姑克盡厥職。未及匝月。八尾子所生之子。遽爾夭折。哀痛之餘。時有　外行動。朱熱心愛國。本爲老同盟會員。奔走四方無暇顧及。彼姊妹花。頓生異志席捲而遁。十載恩情。付諸逝水。留東外史之窮形盡相者。竊恐未能狀其萬一也。一般靑年學子之溺於倭花者。盍以朱爲前車之鑑也可。</p>

<h3>佛蘭克林（五）</h3>
<p>小徒弟列傳之一</p>
<p>佛蘭克林四十歲才開始電之研究。一七四六年司賓斯從蘇格蘭來到波斯頓玩了一些電的把戲給他看，他覺得很有趣味，可惜司賓斯不是内行，玩处不大好。他回到費城之後，不久，倫敦皇家學會會員，科林孫送給他的圖書館公司一根玻璃管。他便拿了這根玻璃管復演司賓斯没有玩好的電的實騐。過不多時，他便成了這些實騐的老手。許多朋友拜他做師傅。他便設了一個玻璃管製造室，吹了一些玻璃管分送給朋友們，因此會玩這些電的把戲的人便一天多一天。内中有一位名呌金耐爾司勒Cinnersley,賦閑在家，佛蘭克林勸他到各處表演電的實騐，收聽講費過活。演詞是佛蘭克林代寫。每次演講，聽衆都很踴躍。演詞中有一篇題爲閃電與電氣是同一的東西TheSameness　ofLightning　and　Electricity,寄給倫敦朋友，皇家學會會員們笑笑把它放在一邊。但科林孫畢竟將它付印，連出五版，不久便譯成法文，意文，德文，拉丁，風行一時，竟成爲當時電學唯一之傑作。法國科學泰斗諾累Nollet反對佛蘭克林之新學說，但達利巴Dalibard與德羅DeLor則於一七五一年根據佛蘭克林著作中所建議之實騐在馬里Marly地方將閃電引到地下來證明佛蘭克林學說之正確。巴黎人士蜂擁來到馬里參觀這破天荒的實騐，從此，佛蘭克林便一躍而爲當時電學之權威。</p>
<h3>述吾國守土不屈之英雄（下）</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>閻麗亨麗亨。名應之。順天通州人。崇禎十四年。爲吾蘇江陰縣典史。嗣以流寇蠭起。隱居邑之砂山。迨南都亡。各州郡畫地自守。都起民兵以自保。乙酉精下薙髮令。有諸生許用德者。率衆倡義。一時踴躍爭附者萬人。以陳明選主兵事。邵康公爲將。周靖龍泊江口以相犄角。未幾。淸師壓城下。徽人程璧復散家資二萬五千餘金。以	充饟糈。而乞師於吳淞總兵吳志葵。時陳明選邵康公已戰敗。而周靖龍亦於江口失利。勢危甚。蓋事在閏六月上旬。陳明選急。乃詔衆曰。「予智勇實不如閻麗亨。此守土之責。非閻君莫屬。」乃於黑夜馳騎往迎之。閻遂告奮勇。率家人四十人以赴。入城。兵卒殘餘無幾。餉亦匱乏。計無所出。不得已。首料尺籍。後令户出一丁。餘傳飱。終勸喻巨室。輸無須金。菽米布帛可用者是。又以前曾化龍所製火藥悉貯之堞樓。於是不保朝暮之危城。始得有守禦。然敵已圍合於外。薄城脚者。奚止十萬。面閻命堅守。用鐵葉裹門板。貫鐵　護之。城中更築土壘。束藁爲人。人竿一燈。立以誘敵。比曉。獲矢無算。淸師中有劉良佐者。本與閻稔。傳語欲見。閻乃登城陴答之曰。「汝從賊。復有何面目以與我見耶。」卒不屈。而江陰雖彈丸之地。死守至八十餘日。始亡於淸。皆閻一人之力也。以視敵未至。而望風先遁。一若先去以爲民望者。眞羞死已　　黄陶庵明吾邑人。名淳耀。字藴生。爲諸生。崇禎壬舉於鄉。迨成進士。觀政都察院。不謁選歸。初與陸元輔輩。結直言社以通聲氣。甲申京師陷。福王立。諸進士皆授官。陶庵獨避之。入乙酉。南都復破。時邑城亦危。勢且不保。陶庵與其弟淵耀謀固守之。迺與侯峒曾等集士民千餘。以與敵相持。不久而陷。峒曾溺宣家池。不死。立水中歎曰。「人死亦大難事。」後卒殉焉。陶庵知大舆已去。入西林庵將自盡。僧人無等謂之曰。「公未服官。奚以死乎。」陶庵曰。「城亡與亡。豈以出處貳心。」乃索筆書曰。「宏光元年七月四日。進士黄淳耀自裁於西城僧舍。嗚呼。進不能宣立王朝。退不能潔身自隱。讀書寡益。學道無成。耿耿不寐。此心而已。異日寇氛復靖。中華士庶。再見天日。論其世者。尚知予心。」書罷。顧其弟已赫然梁間矣。陶庵仰屋而嘆。遂縊其側。時年四十有四。其口血噴壁間。以流於石。迄今天陰雨晦時。猶隱隱可見。名曰「留碧。」蓋其精靈。歷久不泯云。先陶庵在京師。有見臚傳時。鼎甲先上。人每嘖嘖稱羡。陶庵爲之太息不已。曰「天地間自有數千年一人。或幾百年一人。今人不肯爲。而必欲爲三年之一人。何耶。」淵耀年甫弱冠。聞變。即習弓刀。讀孫吳書。亦慷慨自命。噫。値此暴日侵凌之際。苟不自衛自救。其何以存。吾願稍有血氣者。皆當秉此决心。崇拜往昔之人豪。以圖最後之爭勝也</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>一分鐘的黑暗。近世界最偉大的偉人。要算是最近去世的美國大發明家愛迪生T.Edison了。無論是華盛頓拿破崙。只爲他們的一國立功。無益於别國與别國的人。惟有愛迪生却使全世界的人都受其惠。我們每夜在電燈下工作。就應當想念到這位偉大的發明家了。此次美國爲追悼他起見。所以在他殯殮之夕十點鐘時。將全國的電燈完全熄滅一分鐘。從大西洋岸以至太平洋岸。在這一分鐘間都成了黑暗世界。連那鼎鼎有名的自由神像右手中高擎着的電炬。也漆黑無光。當時有一般神經過敏的人。深恐在這一分鐘的黑暗期間。那些愍不畏汉的盗賊。將大肆活動。施展他們雞鳴狗盗的手段。然而追悼這位大發明家。是人同此心。心同此理的。所以這黑暗的一分鐘安然過去。一些没有事情發生。全美國的警務當局。都吐了一口氣。定下了心了。</p>
<h3>英人之言</h3>
<p>— 斅</p>
<p>友人鍾君。留學英國。頃來書。爲述我國旅英留學生。於上月某日。在倫敦開反日大會。該國劍橋大學史學敎授馬剌嘉氏。亦蒞會演說。語多警惕而懇切。聞者爲之動容。鍾君並將氏之演詞錄示。兹轉紀於此。以餉國人。</p>
<p>（上略）設日人久佔滿洲而不撤兵。且危及關内。試問諸君於此時。果作何種思想。予意諸君自必發憤歸國。結合團體。以與日人拚命。此等思想。余甚欽佩。在貴國亦屬難得。但自余觀之。恐仍無濟。蓋貴國人之就義。只能自尋短見。不能殺敵致勇。只有一人進退出處之思想。並無國家存亡利害之觀念。吾自歷史上觀之。如明末時。殉難盡忠者。非不多。或閉户自盡。或投河奔井。甚則駡賊而死。絶不有一致命於敵人者。此與國家有何利益。</p>
<p>且多死一人。即少一殺敵之人。無益於己國。而反利於敵人。我英國人民决無如此思想。如此行爲之人。</p>
<p>余今更舉例以證之。諸君其勿怪。余讀揚州十日記。嘉定屠城記。余深歎支那人種。是天生在應行淘汰之列。蓋當時揚州城内。尚有人民八十萬人。淸兵來者不過數千。兩人敵一人。可以殺死四十萬。即以十人敵一人。亦可殺死八萬人。而其時人心渙散。尚各希冀免死。祇思鼠走兎奔。不想集合大羣。同心禦侮。至刀斧臨頭。則惟有引頸就戳而已。故往往聚數千百男女。令一兵驅之。如驅羊豕。莫敢發一聲者。夫人類究非牛馬貓犬。何以馴服一至於此。試問今日列强競爭。天演淘汰。地球上尚能容此等人種以占據一席地耶。今諸君苟大發義憤。不惜一死以救國亡。余敢以一言正告諸君。諸君决不可如前之爲一身進退出處而死。要當爲一國存亡利害而死。爲一身進退出處而死。死不免爲匹夫。爲一國存亡利害而死。	死乃無愧爲國民。</p>
<p>余實深願諸君勤學好問。勉成世界學者。諸君爲求學而來。亦無不願勤學好問。以成世界學者。但至國家存亡一髮之際。又不願諸君僅以求學之心。置國事於不問。貴國開明者少。諸各對於本國實負絶大之責任。諸君而不問。更有誰問國事者。幸而無事。諸君在此讀書。亦應注意尚武精神。使一面爲學生。一面即有軍人資格。貴國習於文弱。向以執兵爲恥。亦一亡國之原因也。不幸而中日竟至决裂。諸君留待學成。緩不濟急。余勸諸君各歸本省。集結團體。各自保其土地。儘力與日人抵抗。使人人能殺敵致勇。有身可殺。家可破。土地不可失之意。則貴國四萬萬人。雖甚貧弱。誰能亡之乎。余希望貴國自立甚切。故不覺與諸君言之過摯。諸君其善思之。</p>
<h3>志摩之死（五）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>「我此行眞是不虚。海粟你再到我家去談一會好不好。」志摩在車中說。一直講到福煦路。我因爲第二天去杭州所以堅持着要回家。他與文柏下了車。就此不得復見。</p>
<p>那第二天。我便坐了快車。向杭州去。在硤石。遇見志摩的父親申如先生。他和我講着志摩。講着他們家庭的事。一直談到杭州。</p>
<p>諸位。西湖是我所愛的。我離别它已經有五年之久了。</p>
<p>我旅歐期間。也曾經在瑞士作畫六月。那多變的萊夢湖也是我所極愛的。現在又來到淡泊的西子湖了。若問我愛那處更甚。這却難答。萊夢湖是極其壯闊的。它的周圍有兀立的雪山。我愛它的神秘而偉大。我願意歸心低首於它。西子湖是淡泊而秀雅的。它點綴着蘇堤和白堤。我愛它玲瓏而幽默。這也許太抽象。然而我只能拿人的畫筆來形容它們了。這次我到西湖畫了五天畫。無來由的引起我無限的傷感。十一月二十日那一天我同周碧初鄢克昌二位跑上丁家山去作畫。目擊着一天園的荒廢。敗壞。我想起南海先生。不覺憑在開天天室的窗上。臨風涔涔流了許多酸淚。那天晚上歸去。有二處請我吃飯丨嚴次平等及林風眠輩。我先到嚴君那裏去吃了幾杯酒。不多時姜敬廬來簡催我去。他說「林君住在半山。恐怕你不認識。所以我親自來同去。」我想這眞是當不起的。即時就趕回旅店。姜君等已經在大門口等着。</p>
<p>「你今日看報没有。」姜君闢頭就這樣問。我說還没有功夫。是否黑龍江失守。他說是的。不過還有一件使你更傷心的事呀。你的朋友徐志摩乘飛機焚死。我聽了這一句。正如靑天霹靂。渾身冰冷。這一晚轉輾反側。慟極痛極。第二天我就先回上海。先到滃洲别墅去着王文柏。知道志摩之死是無疑的了。後來又到志摩家去。只是悽慘的靜默。</p>
<p>我的心酸腸斷。我終覺得從此心後我失却了知己。我深深地覺出了宇宙間凄楚與孤立。（完）</p>

<h3>與子同仇（五）</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第一章漁陽鼙鼓</p>
<p>一夜的砲火。轟醒了許多人的睡夢。驚碎了許多人的心胆。S城中的文武官員有些已如驚弓之鳥。高飛遠颺。有些已作階下之囚。横被幽禁。城内外已入於騷亂狀態。到處。只見太陽國的軍人。荷槍持械雄糾糾氣昂昂。殺氣滿面。都是殺人不眨眼的惡魔。可憐S城的人民雖然無抵抗。却不知枉送了許多人的性命。因爲他們已將S城佔領。四出搜查。順便搶掠。此時中國人的性命不値錢了。被殺了還要算爲暴動的土匪咧。在那S城的東門外。有一個愛國大學。是那裏最有價値的大學。遐邇馳名。校長熊鳳也是個軍人。年少英俊。捐輸出他的家財來創辦這個大學校。因他鑒於太陽國的步步逼人。着着進取。行見大好河山。將被他們宰割而去。有心人能不浩嘆。空言愛國。無裨實事。所以主辦了這個學校。實施軍事敎育。要造成將來爲國干城的人才。校中新式槍械皆全。且有飛機兩架。練習航空。所聘的敎員都是有很豐富的軍事學識的專家。校中學生也有一千多人。男女兼收。在女同學中很不乏花木蘭沈雲英之輩。但有些熬不起磨練。耐不住辛苦的學生。大都半途中止。逃學而去。留在校中的盡是有堅忍毅力的靑年。所以這個學校。在中國地方可說是破天荒的。假若全國大學校都有這種切實的軍事訓練。只要及到愛國大學的百分之五十。菁菁者莪。將來怕不是愛國志士。有强固的體魄。高尚的智慧。一旦國家有事。可以效命彊圉麽。那太陽國人因此對於這學校十分嫉視。而又有三分忌憚的。所以在他壓迫的勢力之下。便有一大家太陽國軍逕向愛國大學包圍。愛國大學裏的學生們早已知道這個警耗。有幾個熱烈的靑年。很願冒死一戰。可是自己那邊究竟不是軍隊。况又在無抵抗命令之下。不敢輕啓戰釁。祇得紛紛四散。各自爲謀了。</p>

<h3>債劵市之維持觀</h3>
<p>邇來本埠工商各業曁各界所視爲最重要問題者首推對日交涉、次即債劵無限止之跌價、而後者對於金融各業投資者關係尤切、爲目下各方所集中注意而猶未得妥善辦法兹略分述如後、</p>
<p>查我國政府發行之債劵、其已流通於市面者、約計已逾七萬萬元、以前北方所發者、如九六等猶未計入、由過去情况以觀、因政府重視債信、經過殊屬良好、一般投資爲債劵買賣者、漸感興趣、其在金融市塲就最近數年來言之、確已佔有甚重要位置、惟自今夏以來、以國内多故、每呈低落、趨勢尚猶緩和、不幸日軍無理突於九月間侵佔東北後、外交形勢嚴重、戰禍一觸即發、遂致人心慌亂、成債劵市空前未有之慘跌、數月内繼續猛降達三十餘元、令金融市塲受重大之壓迫、</p>
<p>債劵市價之變動、其關係至廣、大自一國内政外交政策之决定、小如一般社會金融之變化、以及稅收及年歲豐歉等、一切均足以影響債市、我國現處空前未有之水災及外侮、人心虚弱已極、購買力大减供過於求之債券市塲、自爲必然之趨勢、其如何籌劃令市面緩和、振作人心、是須統籌兼顧、實力維持、空言已無濟於事、若更偏于一方、更足令人心不安、失其信任而已、</p>
<p>就上兩月之維持經過言之、各方可謂確盡相當力量、如交易所方面增收保證金、金融業酌行收購、並允做押欵、凡此均已收一時效果、特在最近兩星期内、其處置頗有未盡善者、如以十一月念四日價爲標準價格、爲最低限價、絶對禁止賣出新交易、禁止新賣出、交易所方面昔曾行之、事屬一時權宜、固難非議、至標凖價究以何爲標準、實鮮根據、就實際言、債劵漲達八九折不爲高、今之下跌、亦自有其原因、有此規定、適令人心益呈不安、甚或更釀成嚴重之局勢、將擾亂金融市場惡果、蓋將來各價事實上果低於限價時、則市塲將無法結價、收貨者儘可以此藉口、棄置不顧矣、而由前日消息、復有謂債劵將再有維持辦法、定以後公債買賣一律須用現欵現貨、不得以少數保證金作空虚鉅額交易、又定以後公債價格跌落最低、不得超過上月二十四日之最低標準、跌價如逾此範圍、可隨時停止交易是則所謂標準限價者、固猶穩定如前也、至謂不得以少數保證金、作空虚鉅額買賣一語、此乃直接與交易所法衝突、以交易所法二十八條固明明有期貨交易之規定、若一切交易均須現欵現貨、便何必有此期貨交易之規定、是於事實於法理、均有違反、使果實行者、徒令市面益增糾紛、市塲人心益覺不安而已、</p>
<p>但就事實上言、目下證劵市確已達最嚴重時期、設法救濟緩無可緩、救濟之道、安定人心、鼓勵投資、自屬當今急務、政府修明政治、和平统一、善處外交、外侮不至、爲最上策、次則就可能範圍、設法减債、通令全國金融業酌量投資、規訂奬懲辦法（目下如本埠金融業方面、除作爲發劵保證金外、債券收存、聞屬無多、外埠當尤甚、）若集中力量、不難安定人心、抬高市價、收維持之實效、對於交易所方面、一方任其自由交易、以示債信、一方可令加徵保證金、限制投機、一切枝節辦法、其足令人心益增不安、貽未來之糾紛者、概予除、嚴密從而監督之可矣（梧）</p>

<h3>遠月粉廠出趨低</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、又趨不振之象、雖洋麥之報價、曾見回漲、惟以目下局勢之不寗、實際銷場之减退、遂使人心摇動、難於維持、查本月份之標準、各大廠均已自動不另加價、任客帮之抽套、實底之豐足、不難推想故上下午均因此故、市勢尚定、遠期各月份、則各廠均有出檔、數量巨大、藎進近出遠業外之買方、又受打擊、所以遠期步落、使做多者、不易再擯也、觀察後步、近期雖覺見穩、惟後步之難、一關、仍不能免也、結果本月份較前週末小二厘半月份小七厘半、二月份小一分二厘半、三月份小二分、四月份小二分二厘半、五月份小二分麵粉交易所對於陽歷結賬、已定本月二十五半云、</p>

<h3>五金英鋼板暴板三四錢</h3>
<p>五金交易、邇來異常岑寂、但到貨踴躍、人心萎靡、所以各貨均多見回落也、而英鋼板最近跌勢較之其他更爲嚴烈、良以市存暴富之影響、去路在此國事蜩塘之時、頗爲稀少、因是同業求售心切、而行情愈見下游、刻市二釐半每擔祇售八兩五錢半分六兩一錢、七釐平五兩三四錢、一分五兩分半以上均祇售四兩八九錢、查比之先前行情、均已回落三四錢不等云、</p>

<p>靑年園地</p>
<h3>放氣</h3>
<p>— 征鴻</p>
<p>冷淸淸的課室裏、只寥寥的坐着幾個人、外面下着細雨、陰沉的氣息、佈滿了一室、使大家都不起勁、各自靜悄悄地、預備着功課、</p>
<p>「喂、怎樣、你們覺得悶氣嗎、陰雨眞討厭、」勇似乎給沉寂壓迫得快要窒塞了、隨便說句什麽話破破沉寂都好、</p>
<p>「本來、有誰歡迎陰雨的呢、尤其是悶悶地關在學校裏的人、」一個似乎響應又似乎反駁的聲音、</p>
<p>「但是、歡樂吧、别管牠是陰雨、今天是我們的總理的誕日呀、」武一本正經地說着、「想一想、六十六年前的今日、我們的大偉人出世了、他也是一個平民、像我們一樣、他也是生在内憂外患的時期、像我們一樣、而他却能抱定堅忍不拔之意志、大無畏的精神、以救國救民爲己任、終於爲國家爲人民、立定了自由的基礎而我們這時代的靑年呢、口號是會喊的、</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>喊聲也許比當年的總理還高吧、而實際呢、鬧了一陣、也就算了、喊到了什麽、就算做到了什麽了、看看眞有些威風、而其實現代靑年只有一張嘴是可稱讚的、」</p>
<p>「好了、好了高調是誰也會唱的、我倒要問你、你自己怎樣、大概是一個實行家吧、二個嘲諷的聲音、</p>
<p>「這不用問的、我和你和其他的人都差不多、好像是一個模型裏出來人、誰逃得出這個流行病啊、」</p>
<p>「哦、旣然大家都是一樣、那末誰都没有譏刺誰的資格、」</p>
<p>「甚麽、我是在譏刺嗎、這是事實呢、……但是、也好、一個人煩悶的時候、難道就不能自己譏刺自己嗎、」</p>
<p>「能夠自己譏刺自己、那總算覺悟了吧、」甚麽人哼的一笑、</p>
<p>「倒也未必、吃鴉片的人、未必不知道鴉片是毒的哩、」</p>
<p>「不必計較罷、總之、現代靑年的頽廢、是事實、無可諱的了、」這是立的無聊的聲音、她把預備着的書往面前一推、也加入這談話了「起初呢、鋭氣是有的、可是碰到了一次挫折、鋭氣就减少一次、最後、便意懶心灰不起勁了、什麽勇往直前、百折不回、不過是說說罷了……這像海浪打岸一樣、打不落岸、也就退回去了、」</p>
<p>「你這比喻、不見得對罷、海浪衝不掉岸、固然是退回去了、但是牠立刻湧起再來的啊、而且聲勢是一回幾一回兇猛了……現代靑年呢、與其說是像衝岸海浪不如說是像退潮的水吧、順着勢頭、寫寫意意地流去就算了、」</p>
<p>「哦、這樣嗎、我想現代靑年不致這樣吧、我的意思是、我們現代靑年勇氣未嘗没有、却是愛護者太多了、不讓他們去勞苦、你看、當一個靑年要發展他的靑春之熱力時、要奮鬥時、就有一個仁慈而嚴厲的面容、用一個威重而親愛的聲音說、「啊、不要動吧、這是無益的、我是愛你的、不忍看着你走進歧途啊、」於是這個靑年在仁慈與威嚴交攻之下、無所用其勇氣了、倘使是威逼、不許他怎樣做、那倒是不怕的、因爲奮鬥的樂趣、反抗的快感、也足以使他不顧一切了……總之、現代靑年是被軟化了」這是又一個聲音、</p>
<p>「咦、怎樣、你們的談話、竟没有完的嗎、」那邊一個似乎聽得討厭起來了「而且你們的談話裏、不、是議論吧、充滿着陰沈的氣息、無聊之極、我請求你們、可以不可以、談話不要陰雨化、聽着這種談話眞像處在陰雨裏、一樣使人不爽快…唉、這種陰沈的天氣、陰沈的談話、我眞有些吃不消呢」</p>
<p>「其實、我們也算不上談話、老實講、不過因爲關在學校裏、煩悶不堪、放放氣罷了、」</p>
<p>這時候、别一間敎室裏、有口琴的聲音傳來、吹的是一只大家熟習的曲調、於是大家不約而同、放開各别的嗓子、跟着口琴唱起來、</p>

<h3>League of Nations Seeks a Way Out</h3>
<p>Resolution Attached with a Statement Regarding Japan's Right to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>China Will Make a Reservation Emphasizing Legal Principles</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Pressing Towards Ma Zhanshan's Troops Along the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway</p>

<h3>League of Nations Drafting Committee Listens to Chinese and Japanese Opinions</h3>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Prepares to Accept the Resolution</p>
<p>Japan Agrees to a Method of Attaching a Separate Statement</p>
<p>(Paris) It is generally believed that the Manchurian dispute now has hope of an early resolution. This morning, Dr. Shi told the drafting committee that the instructions he received from the Nanjing government have allowed him to accept the resolution of the Administrative Council in its current form. However, if there are any amendments that are not included in the instructions he received, he will report them to Nanjing. The latest explanation he received regarding the situation in Jinzhou is that Chinese troops in Jinzhou have not been reinforced, nor do they have any intention of attacking. The drafting committee recognizes the neutral zone as an urgent issue, but did not consider any practical proposals regarding this matter during this morning's meeting. Briand will meet with Yoshizawa today. It is said that Yoshizawa may receive practical instructions from the Tokyo government today regarding the points of the League of Nations resolution that have not been resolved. It is reported that the issue of bandit suppression has now been agreed upon and will not be included in the resolution or its preamble. Yoshizawa will make a special reservation regarding this matter. There is now another suggestion to move Article 5 of the resolution, which is related to the powers of the Commission of Inquiry and opposed by Japan, to the preamble, but its wording has not been fully agreed upon. It is also reported that Yoshizawa will present practical proposals today regarding the neutral zone in Jinzhou and its status. The Japanese delegation hosted a banquet for the twelve members of the Administrative Council and their key advisors this afternoon. Dr. Shi was also invited, but did not attend. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Due to conflicting opinions on the Japanese side regarding the solution to the Manchurian problem, the League of Nations Council made no progress in drafting a resolution today. The panic caused by the news of the resignation of China's Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji seems to have passed. Today, the Council's drafting committee and Ito, the legal advisor of the Japanese delegation, continued to discuss Article 5 of the resolution. It is said that the Japanese delegation still does not agree to discuss the issue of the League of Nations Commission of Inquiry and the withdrawal of Japanese troops together. However, Ito has reported the League of Nations' attitude to his government and hopes to receive new instructions from Tokyo within 24 hours. The League of Nations is deeply concerned that Japan will completely overturn the draft resolution, but hopes that Tokyo can seize the opportunity and make appropriate concessions on the issues of the neutral investigation team and Japan's freedom to suppress bandits. This is not absolutely impossible. The Council's drafting committee is now scheduled to meet with China's Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji again on Monday morning, as Shi has recently received new instructions from Nanjing. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The drafting committee met with Ito today from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM. The main point of discussion was the wording of Article 5 of the resolution, which is related to the powers of the Commission of Inquiry. Japan proposed that if the next meeting of the Administrative Council instructs the Commission of Inquiry to report on the withdrawal of Japanese troops, it should be allowed to prepare such a report. The drafting committee believes that this is unacceptable because it restricts the powers of the Commission of Inquiry. After further discussion, another proposal was suggested, but no decision was made. As for Yoshizawa's right to announce Japan's freedom to suppress bandits in a public meeting, it was not discussed. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Ito proposed a vague suggestion yesterday, stating that the Administrative Council should not make a resolution regarding the mission of the Commission of Inquiry at this time, but rather wait until the next regular meeting to consider it. By the intermediate period, the Commission of Inquiry should have arrived in Manchuria, and all the circumstances should be fully understood, and the beneficial tasks of the Commission could be easily determined. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The drafting committee reconvened at 11:00 AM this morning to listen to Shi Zhaoji's opinions. The issue of the neutral zone does not seem to have been discussed. Shi only discussed the draft resolution and the declaration of the chairman of the Administrative Council with the committee. According to our agency, although Shi is under significant pressure from patriotic elements, he can still accept the resolution, but will make some reservations. These reservations are more focused on legal principles than on practical considerations. In that case, an agreement on the resolution will eventually be reached. Briand will meet with Yoshizawa at 3:30 PM this afternoon, and the twelve-member committee will meet at 5:00 PM. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to sources in charge here, the Japanese government is prepared to accept the League of Nations Administrative Council's suggestion that Japan should issue a separate statement to reserve its right to suppress bandits in Manchuria, but it must be accompanied by the condition that China does not propose a counter-proposal to cancel Japan's right. The Japanese government has also decided to accept Ito's proposed plan regarding the powers of the Commission of Inquiry. The above two matters are the points in the League of Nations resolution that require Japan's agreement. The Japanese government's instructions can be sent to Paris tonight. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Publishes British Inspector's Report</h3>
<p>(Paris) The British inspector's report on Jinzhou, published today, states that the situation in Jinzhou is normal except for Japanese aircraft flying over for reconnaissance. The situation in Tongliao has also returned to normal since the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Japanese troops left 100 men stationed at Linghekou to defend Xinmin and prevent banditry. British officials on the Beining Railway are currently supervising bridge repair work near Raoyang River. Another British official's memorandum, published tonight, states that there are 300 Japanese soldiers west of the Liao River patrolling the Beining Railway line, claiming that bandits are active, hence the move. However, the British inspector did not see any evidence of bandit activity. The French inspector's report states that there have been no changes in the situation since the last report. Trains on the Beining Railway are now gradually running as normal. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British government reported to the Administrative Council a few days ago that 400 Japanese, formally under the name of the Volunteer Corps of the Shenyang Consulate General, had arrived in Harbin. The Japanese delegation has now reported to the League of Nations that this is incorrect. It is said that the British Consulate General there has not received any such news. The report is signed by the Director of the Japanese League of Nations Representative Office. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Denies Being Beaten and Injured</h3>
<p>(Paris) There were startling rumors here today that Dr. Shi was beaten by Chinese students and suffered facial injuries. This is completely unfounded. This morning, a Reuters reporter visited Dr. Shi. Shi denied being beaten. Shi currently has a slight cold and there are no visible signs of being beaten, and there are no injuries on his face. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Approach Niannian, Ma Zhanshan's Troops on High Alert</h3>
<p>(Harbin) On the 5th, 600 Japanese cavalry, protecting workers of the South Manchuria Railway and one train car, opened to Qikeshan, forcibly repairing the Tahar bridge. Over a thousand infantry and artillery troops moved towards the Qikeshan line on the evening of the 5th, still intending to oppress our Black Army. That place is 45 li away from Niannian station. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the evening of the 5th, Ma Zhanshan sent Commander Pu to the front to convey orders. Our troops at Tahar station on the Qikeshan line concentrated towards Niannian on the afternoon of the 5th, forming a solid defense line with the defending troops there, awaiting the Japanese army's attack. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Ma Zhanshan appointed Shi Ruibin, Chief of Staff of the Third Brigade, as commander of the 55th Artillery Regiment, incorporating the artillery of the teams and regiments of the Tenth Brigade into one regiment, stationed in Lindian. Yuan Chonggu, commander of the First Brigade of the Black Army, is currently in Baiquan. The report in the Tianjin newspaper that he died in battle at Sanjianfang is inaccurate. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) When Lieutenant General Domon, commander of the Second Division of the Japanese Army, left Harbin on the 5th, shameless gentry and merchants of Harbin held a farewell banquet. Domon stated during the banquet that the Japanese army's attack this time was a great misfortune. In addition to his younger brother, who died in battle as a major general brigade commander, the number of soldiers who died reached 800, which was truly unexpected. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the evening of the 5th, the Japanese army continued to transport over a thousand cavalry troops from Changchun to Harbin. All the barracks inside and outside the city were full. (6th)</p>
<h3>US Representative Reports the Situation is Still Optimistic</h3>
<p>(Washington) People in the US State Department are currently quietly observing the progress of the League of Nations Council's mediation of the Northeast China Incident and do not wish to comment. However, the Dawes Report states that the situation is still optimistic. (Guomin News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Conducts Bombing Exercises in Shenyang</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese army began conducting bombing exercises with 30 aircraft in Shenyang on the 4th, and occupied villages such as Yangguantun Tumuchang and Fuling Dashimiao in the east of the city. Dozens of villagers in the east of the city have fled. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Liaoning Province Harass Rural Areas Separately</h3>
<p>Under the Pretext of Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>Air Force Carries Out Bombings</p>
<p>Battles in Changtu Area</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram: This morning, Honjo sent more than ten aircraft to various villages near Xinmin and northwest of Liaoyang to carry out bombings under the pretext of suppressing bandits. More than 300 farmers were victimized. At the same time, a large group of the White Dragon Society was discovered in the Changtu area and are currently clashing with Japanese troops.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Fair Discussion on the Patriotic Movement of Students</h3>
<p>Since September 18th, the outrages inflicted on our country by the Japanese army, and the extremely unfair judgment of the League of Nations towards us, are deeply felt. Any national with warm blood finds it difficult to endure and impossible to sit idly by. This kind of fact has stimulated the youth, with their keen sensitivity, pure will, and vigorous blood. They have risen up in uproar. Since the seventh decade [of the Republic], the youth throughout the country have gone on strike, marched, petitioned, demonstrated, cut their fingers to join the army, and even committed suicide, all under the same goal, making the domestic atmosphere suddenly tense. This kind of passionate public sentiment fully demonstrates that the national spirit of our ancient country has not yet completely died. In an environment of "no resistance," there are still these passionate and tragic actions. We cannot but admit that a ray of life of our nation rests in this.</p>
<p>Today, domestic public opinion's observation and criticism of this tragic behavior of students are extremely inconsistent. Some sympathize, some regret, some are disgusted, and some even see it as a flood or beast, and cannot be tolerated by national laws and disciplines. However, from our point of view, the current running and shouting and loud appeals of students and youth, although stimulated by facts and reacting with occasional errors outside the right track, their motives are forgivable, their actions are admirable, and their arduous and weeping appeals are worthy of song and lamentation. We should give them absolute sympathy and absolute understanding. Disgust is not acceptable, and seeing them as a flood or beast is even more inappropriate.</p>
<p>The invaders are deep. The country is in danger. Looking around the country, are there any who are as generous, passionate, and tireless as the students, running and shouting for the sake of national difficulties? The mature hold their ground, the passive stand by, and the cowardly are even more willing to surrender. Foreign troubles are increasingly approaching, and diplomacy is increasingly failing. At this time, since our country cannot compete with violence, using the passionate public sentiment as a strong backing for the government and diplomacy, and showing the world the spirit of our nation's struggle against violence, is the appropriate action for a nation with a 5,000-year history. If even this passive resistance is absent, and the whole country is calm, silent, and lifeless, we can only close our eyes and imagine what kind of country this will become. In the autumn of national crisis, there is concern that the people will not take responsibility, and now they laugh, dislike, suspect, and mistrust the tragic behavior of students. We cannot but admit that this is the most regrettable phenomenon. Suppose those who dislike students today were also pure and courageous students, in today's dangerous and urgent situation, would they be able to treat it as if it were the fat or thin of a person from Qin or Yue, indifferent and without joy or sorrow? The country has reached this point. Foreign enemies are pressing, and domestic difficulties are overwhelming, making it impossible for students to settle down in their affairs, and they have to shout loudly to awaken the people to save themselves. Apart from further strengthening our determination to resist violence and struggle to save ourselves, what else can be said about this tragic and painful phenomenon?</p>
<p>According to the announcements of the Civil Affairs Department and the Central Propaganda Department, all of the students' current actions that are off track are due to mistakenly believing rumors and misunderstandings of the government. If this is the case, we are deeply pleased. However, with such a serious diplomatic issue, all of our domestic news relies on the transmission of foreign telegrams, allowing it to be transmitted erroneously. Our diplomatic situation is not public, making the people of the whole country fall into a thick fog of confusion and panic all day long. Then, the authorities cannot shirk their responsibility for the students' obvious mistakes. Youth are the backbone of society, and the pillars of our country in the future. If we see today's youth as a flood or beast, and cannot be approached, can the near future of our country still be asked about? Therefore, we believe that in today's situation, it is possible to give students extreme sympathy, accept the sincerity of students, and guide them into the right track of effective struggle. Disgust is unacceptable, and seeing them as a flood or beast is even more unacceptable.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have to sincerely plead with the students. The country's difficulties have reached their peak. We should have patriotic enthusiasm and recognize the goal of struggle. Today, the greatest enemy of our nation is the Japanese imperialists. We should recognize the great enemy in front of us, march towards the enemy's camp with a unified pace, and never allow confusion and deviation to disrupt the entire front. This is one way to save the country is through effective struggle, in making people do their duty with good spirit. And the value of one's studies must not be easily sacrificed. Before preparing to sacrifice, we should measure the price we can receive. So, future actions should be fully considered to ensure that they are not a futile sacrifice that does nothing to help the actual situation. This is the second. The country today is riddled with holes. The danger of disaster has been lurking for more than a day. To save this ancient country with its eyes full of sores cannot be done in one fell swoop. It is necessary to struggle for a long time, never slackening from beginning to end, holding its will without exposing its anger, having its beginning and also holding its end, and everyone preparing to struggle for a long time with a spirit of perseverance. To struggle for a long time, one cannot but rely on learning. If the country in front gets saved this is the third thing. Studying is the duty of students, and saving the country is important, and studying is also important. Even if the country is destroyed and the family is destroyed, the "last lesson" should also be read to the end. At present, many students in the Northeast unite several people to drink a cup of bitter water each, encouraging and vowing not to cooperate with the Japanese and resolutely resist violence, while also studying hard and not giving up the basic knowledge of saving the country. This kind of behavior is most worthy of emulation. If they make many sacrifices without return, then although their efforts are painful, the results are actually small. This is what the youth of our country should understand and recognize.</p>

This ambition and this heart have been understood by patriotic youth petitioning in the capital.

If the government believes that there have been illegal incidents among the people, it must arrest them through legal procedures and conduct trials through legal procedures. 2. The authorities responsible for maintaining order must pay attention to situations where actions taken to prevent unexpected incidents exceed the scope of their authority. Chiang indicated that he accepted these points. (7th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wuda Students Petition</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Receives Them and Gives Instructions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Wuhan University petition group went to the National Government on the 7th to petition. Chiang Kai-shek received them in the National Government Auditorium and stated that students petitioning the government is originally a sign of trust and support for the government, allowing society to stabilize so that it can focus on external affairs. If there are those who use the patriotic movement as a pretext and mix in other meanings, take actions that overstep boundaries, hinder public order, and affect the government's diplomacy, it is tantamount to helping the enemy and harming the petitioning students, and the government will have no choice but to impose sanctions. The clash between the Peking University demonstration group and the police the other day was regrettable. Students are rational people, and their actions should adhere to discipline. He also expressed acceptance of the students' petition points and explained them one by one, stating that there would be no neutral zone and no direct negotiations. (7th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Prohibits Students from Obstructing Traffic</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Education Sends Telegram to Universities</h3>
<p>Explaining the Central Government's Diplomatic Policy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Education telegraphed various universities, explaining the Central Government's diplomatic policy, stating that recent reports in the newspapers regarding Jinzhou, Tianjin, and direct negotiations with Japan are mostly based on foreign dispatches and do not conform to the facts, causing diplomatic youth to easily become suspicious. Now that the Central Government's diplomatic policy has been disclosed in the newspapers, it is feared that various schools may not have a comprehensive understanding. The main points regarding Jinzhou, Tianjin, and direct negotiations are summarized and telegraphed as follows: Regarding the Jinzhou issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urgently telegraphed Representative Shi that Japan's request to establish a neutral zone in Jinzhou cannot be accepted. China believes that the Jinzhou issue should be entrusted to observers from neutral countries to find ways to prevent conflict between the two sides. China cannot agree to the buffer zone proposal put forward by Japan. If Japan attacks Jinzhou, the League of Nations Executive Council should stop it. The Central Government has now decided on three key points: 1. If there is no concrete guarantee from the League of Nations Executive Council and neutral countries regarding Jinzhou, China will never accept the buffer zone plan. The Jinzhou Provincial Government must maintain its existence. If Jinzhou is attacked, our troops will take legitimate defense measures and persevere to the end. 2. Regarding the Tianjin issue, the Central Government has decided to ensure the safety of the Hebei Provincial Government and must make every effort to carry out legitimate defense. As for rumors that Representative Shi has proposed joint administration of Tianjin to the League of Nations, the government has not heard of this and there is no basis for it. 3. Regarding the issue of negotiations with Japan, China has long established a policy that it will never engage in direct negotiations unless Japan withdraws its troops. Yesterday, the Chief Secretary of the Civil Service issued a statement, taking responsibility for this point. The government has decided that the issue of the Three Eastern Provinces should be resolved under the guarantee of the League of Nations and has recently telegraphed this intention to Representative Shi. Under the armed aggression of Japan, it will never engage in direct negotiations. The above points should be announced in detail to the students, so that the students have a deep understanding of the policy set by the Central Government, study in peace, and be the backbone of the National Government. This is of utmost importance. (7th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yesterday, No Senior Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Came to the Ministry to Work</h3>
<p>Unarmed Military Police Came to the Ministry for Protection</p>
<p>Li Jinlun's Resignation Was Persuaded</p>
<p>(Nanjing) None of the important officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came to the ministry today. Only one or two members of the Intelligence Department were present. The Garrison Headquarters and the Police Department sent more than a hundred unarmed military police to the ministry for protection, so that they could dissuade students from coming. Nothing happened in the evening. (7th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun's resignation was earnestly retained by Chiang Kai-shek, and his intention to resign seems to have been canceled. However, he still did not come to the ministry on the 7th to act as the Permanent Vice Minister. Jin Wensi is also on leave. (7th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Administrative Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Jinlun resigned, and the Executive Yuan issued an order to retain him, stating that the Vice Minister has assisted in the ministry's affairs with outstanding diligence and hard work. Now is a time of diplomatic tension, and his services are greatly needed. It is hoped that he will consider the difficulties of the time and continue to serve in his post, so as not to betray the trust placed in him. His request to resign should not be discussed. (7th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Gu Weijun telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee on the 6th, stating that he had been ordered to take on a difficult task and had a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country.

<h3>Reasons for Gu's Desire to Leave</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs unofficially announced the truth about Gu Weijun's desire to leave on the 7th, stating that Gu's passive reasons were definitely not due to seeking to avoid difficulties in the midst of a diplomatic emergency. It was actually because he had only been in office for a few days, and it was a time of greatest diplomatic tension. He was working day and night and still feared that he would not be able to keep up. However, people from all sides came to visit and petition. The representatives of young students were enthusiastic about national affairs, and if they were not received, it would seem that he was focusing on one thing and neglecting everything else, and he could not bear to see them travel and wait. If he met with them one by one, there would be too many people and it would take too much time, which would inevitably delay important official business. His responsibilities were such that he could not be at peace, and he felt the desire to leave at this critical moment. From morning to night, the diplomatic situation changed several times a day, and there was absolutely no time left to attend meetings, handle ministry affairs, study important telegrams, issue instructions, and discuss urgent issues with Representative Shi. He was torn and felt a sense of resignation. (7th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>All-India Congress Declares No Compromise with Britain</h3>
<p>Non-Violent Resistance About to Resume</p>
<p>Reuters, Calcutta, 7th - Judging from the resolution passed by the All-India National Congress in Bengal today, it can be seen that non-violent resistance in India is about to resume, and its nature may be more serious than previous movements. After passing the resolution, the All-India Congress made a declaration of no compromise, saying: "It is time to resume non-violent resistance." Many believe that this declaration is the starting point of a passive resistance movement. It is expected that when Gandhi returns to India, this movement will formally begin immediately. The Bengal Congress advocated thorough planning, and the resolutions it unanimously passed stipulated that all Indian goods and British banks, insurance companies, shipping companies, etc. should be boycotted. The resolution also stipulated the boycott of foreign cloth, and the most affected in the future will be British and Japanese cotton cloth.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Approves New Budget</h3>
<p>Deficit of Less Than 170 Million Yen</p>
<p>Public Bonds to be Issued to Make Up the Difference</p>
<p>Parliament Set to Convene in Two Weeks</p>
<p>Kokumin, Tokyo, 7th - Today's cabinet meeting approved the budget proposed by Finance Minister Inoue, with expenditures totaling 1,479,900,000 yen and revenues totaling 1,307,800,000 yen, a deficit of 172,000,000 yen. The cabinet also approved the Finance Minister's plan to issue 132,030,000 yen in public bonds to make up for the budget deficit and increase tax rates to increase revenue by 40,070,000 yen. Prime Minister Wakatsuki also attended today's cabinet meeting, the first time since he contracted the flu last week. The 60th Japanese Parliament will convene in two weeks, at which time it will study the government's financial measures. Currently, because the Manchurian issue has not been resolved, the major political parties have not drafted important bills before the parliament convenes. When the meeting is held in the future, the main debate will inevitably be the government's China policy.</p>
<h3>Bank for International Settlements Convenes Committee of Experts</h3>
<p>Kokumin, Basel, 7th - The Bank for International Settlements, at the special request of Germany, has convened a committee of experts under the Young Plan. The committee held its first meeting here this morning and began investigating Germany's ability to pay its debts. The meeting is expected to last about two weeks. According to financial expert Stewart, who arrived here last night, although French and German opinions differ greatly now, the investigation is expected to have a satisfactory outcome. However, yesterday, when the committee held a talk to discuss the election of a chairman, disputes arose among the members, so the general public has some doubts about Stewart's remarks.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th - It is expected that when the experts' committee meets today to consider the reparations issue, there will be a lengthy and difficult discussion. The French government stated that this committee should not only discuss conditional reparations based on the German memorandum that was convened, but the committee should deal with the entire debt issue, that is, to stop the Young Plan or establish another compensation method. Germany also wants to link private debts with reparations, but the French representative will demand that unconditional reparations and private debts not be involved, because private debts will soon be considered by a special committee of bankers in Berlin and should not be confused with reparations.</p>
<h3>Germany to Issue Emergency Decree to Universally Reduce Cost of Living</h3>

However, the salaries of officials must be reduced immediately from 5% to 10%. Including the salary reduction implemented at the beginning of this year, it has been reduced by 20%.</p>
<h3>Soviet Government Opposes Postponement of Disarmament Conference</h3>

The central executive committee's newspaper Izvestia today detailed various propaganda efforts by various countries to postpone the meeting, saying that if the conference were postponed, peace would suffer a major blow. The current Manchurian dispute between China and Japan and the situation in the Far East urgently require the convening of this conference.</p>

<p>Our Army's Deployment on the Qiqihar-Koshih Road: The Japanese army launched several offensives along the Qiqihar-Koshih Road, all of which were unsuccessful. They have recently retreated to Qiqihar. The first line of the Black Army cavalry is stationed at Tahr River (a small station 45 li from Qiqihar). The troops in that area are the 54th Regiment of Cheng Zhiyuan's Brigade, led by Tu Quansheng. The second line is between Ningnian Station and Fuhai Station, 120 li from Taian Town and 70 li from Tahr River. Stationed here is the 52nd Regiment of Cheng Zhiyuan's Brigade, led by Zhu Fengyang. The third line is between Taian Town and Aolonggou, 45 li from Keshan County. Stationed here are the 53rd Regiment of Cheng Zhiyuan's Brigade, led by Zhou Zuolin, and the 3rd Regiment of Wu Songlin's Brigade, led by Wang Kezhen. The general reserve cavalry, the 4th Regiment of Wu's Brigade led by Sha Libu and the 2nd Regiment led by Liu Bin, are stationed in Keshan County. All the main forces of the Black Army cavalry are deployed along the Qiqihar-Koshih Road. For ease of command, Mr. Ma has appointed Cheng Zhiyuan as the commander-in-chief of the cavalry and Wu Songlin as the deputy commander-in-chief. The general headquarters is located in Keshan County. The cavalry adopts a purely guerrilla tactic, without digging trenches or adhering to defense lines. They maintain contact with each other when there is no action and strike forward in unison when there is. The area above Taian Town along the Qiqihar-Koshih Road is mostly plains, which is more advantageous for cavalry operations. There are no defensible features, so digging trenches and building fortifications is not particularly important. From Aolonggou, the infantry brigade led by Yuan is responsible for the area extending diagonally to Baiquan. The 1st Regiment, led by Liu Hongxuan, is stationed near Aolonggou and maintains contact with the cavalry. The 2nd and 3rd Regiments, led by Li and Zhao respectively, are stationed in Baiquan. The 3rd Infantry Brigade and the 1st Cavalry Regiment led by Xu Qingshan serve as a liaison force between Helen, Baiquan, and Keshan, stationed in Shuangyang Town. The 3rd Brigade led by Li Qingshan is stationed in Shuangyang Town as a reserve force. The Replenishment Regiment led by Zhou Xingqi and the Guards Regiment led by Xu Baozhen are stationed in Helen to defend the local area. The 2nd Infantry Brigade led by Su Bingwen and the 4th Regiment of Wu Yushu have returned to Hailar to guard against Inner Mongolia. The 1st Infantry Brigade led by Zhang Dianjiu and the 3rd Regiment of Sun Hongyu have returned to Fularji to guard against the Jingxing area. When the Black Army retreated on the 19th, they were ordered to retreat hastily, and therefore could not concentrate in one place. Those who retreated along the Qiqihar-Koshih Road were not attacked by the enemy due to the cover of the rear troops, and their ranks were not disrupted. Those who received orders later were attacked by enemy tanks and aircraft, which scattered their ranks, especially the infantry. Therefore, their retreat directions were not entirely as specified by Mr. Ma. Many small units were searching for their respective brigade or regimental locations near Helen. Some small units that could not find their brigade or regimental locations went to other brigades and regiments requesting to be reorganized. Therefore, the appearance of each brigade and regimental team remained the same, but the actual composition had changed. The Provisional 1st Infantry Brigade led by Yuan Chonggu originally had three regiments. They were responsible for the front line of Sanjianfang on the 18th. They retreated slightly late. Out of more than 7,000 soldiers, after casualties and wounded, only 2,000 men of the 1st Regiment led by Liu Hongxuan have been recovered to date. As for the Li and Zhao Regiments, only five or six hundred men have arrived. Originally, there was an artillery battalion with nine field guns, but only three remain. The other six were lost on the battlefield. The actual strength has decreased by more than two-fold. The 1st Cavalry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Brigade led by Ma Zhanshan and Xu Qingshan has only 400 horses left. The 5th Infantry Regiment led by Li Qingshan has recovered 600 men. The 3rd Regiment of the 1st Infantry Brigade led by Zhang Dianjiu and Sun Hongbao has recovered 700 men. The 4th Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Brigade led by Su Bingwen and Wu Yushu has recovered 900 men. The Replenishment Regiment led by Zhou Xingqi has recovered 700 men. The Guards Regiment led by Xu Baozhen has recovered 400 men. The 8th Cavalry Brigade led by Cheng Zhiyuan has recovered 4,000 men. The 1st Cavalry Brigade led by Wu Songlin has recovered 3,000 men. In total, the various brigades and regimental teams have recovered 11,000 men to date, which is two-fifths less than before the war. Most of the guns and cannons of the various brigades and regimental teams were either overworked and exploded, or were abandoned after the horses were killed by bombs and could not be transported out of the battlefield. Many of the horses ridden by the cavalry were also wounded or killed. Therefore, replenishment and reorganization will take considerable time.</p>
<p>Lack of Firearms for Newly Organized Militia: Due to the lack of both firearms and ammunition, the newly organized militia in various counties, although already formed in each county, has no practical means. Therefore, there are plans to collect civilian firearms. Militia in the counties of eastern Heilongjiang, such as Sui Leng, Suihua, Zhaodong, Zhaozhou, Helen, Wangkui, Baiquan, Qinggang, and Keshan, will each assign a colonel as the commander-in-chief for every three counties. Each general team will be divided into four companies, and each company will be divided into three platoons. Each company will have 126 cavalrymen, to be formed by December 15th. At that time, Mr. Ma will personally inspect them. A certain prince of the four banners of Inner Mongolia, between Zhaodong and Tailai, recently visited Mr. Ma and requested to organize Mongolian soldiers. Mr. Ma has agreed. From the current situation, although there is no definite date for Mr. Ma to lead the army in a counterattack, it will probably be within the next month. We will soon see the soldiers and horses well-fed and restored, and our homeland will be recovered. As for Helen, originally a county town, the sudden arrival of a large army inevitably caused overcrowding. All shops, organizations, hotels, and institutions are filled with troops, and signs with the names of various brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies are posted in front of the doors. The primary schools in the city have been occupied by the army and various institutions and have been forced to suspend classes. The Joint Military and Political Office is located in the Guangxinyong Oil Mill. This business is state-run by Heilongjiang Province and has spacious courtyards. All the border defense, military law, staff, registry, and military supply departments are located inside. The adjutant's office is located in the Shunji grocery store on East Street. Some of the staff officers and adjutants reside in the Fuhehou on West Street. The military medical office is located in the Model School. The headquarters of the Guards Regiment is located in the Dongfeng Hotel. The grain depot is located in the Yiji Grain Store. The Department of Education is located in the Bureau of Education. The Provincial Party Headquarters is located in the County Farmers' Association. Although the situation is seemingly chaotic, the soldiers and merchants engage in fair buying and selling, without any signs of disorder. Ma Zhanshan has also appointed Xu Baozhen, the commander of the Guards Regiment, as the garrison commander to enforce martial law. After 8:00 p.m. every night, the streets are quiet and traffic is prohibited. There are very few soldiers wandering around outside at night. The Joint Military and Political Office does not have fixed working hours. Every morning at 6:00 a.m., all personnel arrive at Guangxinyong and bury themselves in their work all day long until the afternoon when they disperse for a meal. Mr. Ma himself also lives in Guangxinyong, working tirelessly day and night. Matters are decided immediately, so the staff is exceptionally busy. The department heads and provincial committee members who have arrived include Liu Tingxuan, the head of the Department of Civil Affairs; Ma Jinggui, the head of the Department of Construction; Zheng Lingao, the head of the Department of Education; and Pan Jingwu of the Provincial Committee. The party committee members who have arrived include Wang Binqing, Wu Huanzhang, and Wang Huanan. Liang Heng, the head of the Longsha Public Security Bureau, has also arrived from the police force. More than one hundred key personnel from various institutions are separately managing affairs and actively seeking to restore normalcy.</p>
<p>The Reasons for the Defeat at Sanjianfang: On the evening of the 27th, at 8:00 p.m., I visited Chairman Ma Zhanshan at Guangxinyong. After the registry officer announced my arrival, I was led into the east courtyard where Mr. Ma resided. The outer room was full of key military and political figures. Mr. Ma was still meeting with guests in the inner room. After a short while, the guests left, and the registry officer reported my arrival. I was then ushered in. Mr. Ma was wearing a gray lambskin jacket and blue satin cotton shoes. His cheeks were thin, and his stature was average. He had a mustache and bright eyes, giving him an imposing presence. He was a spirited, energetic, short, and capable man. When he saw me enter, he stood up in the middle of the room, smiled, and offered me a seat. Without waiting for me to ask, he said, "This time we failed to fight well. I am very ashamed that you have come such a long way to inquire. Our army's retreat here is only a temporary measure to avoid disaster. Once our plans are finalized, we will move to another location." When asked about the main reasons for the defeat, Mr. Ma frowned and said, "The reason why our army retreated is that Sanjianfang has no terrain and is not a suitable area for military operations. It is a plain with no defensible obstacles. When the Japanese army initially pressed us, our army retreated slightly, causing us to lose the strategic importance of the Doxinganling River Bridge. I went to the front line on November 6th to supervise the counterattack, but because reinforcements were not forthcoming, we could not cross the river in one go and recapture the Jiangqiao. Therefore, we had to use Sanjianfang as a defensive position. Although we knew it would not be easy to defend, we still hoped to hold out until November 16th, in the hope that the League of Nations resolution would take effect, and the Japanese army would show some restraint and not invade and pressure us. Who would have thought that the enemy would blatantly disregard everything and launch a large-scale offensive, making it difficult for our army to hold firm? This is the first reason for the loss. The Sanjianfang and Tangchi areas are sandy areas, and it was difficult for our army to build solid trenches. The enemy army used tanks and heavy artillery to encircle and attack, and the trenches were flattened. Our army could not hold firm inside the trenches. This is the second reason for the loss. Our army mainly consists of cavalry. However, the elite of Heilongjiang Province has been transferred to the interior of China, and the remainder are old and weak soldiers with no major war experience. Moreover, they could not form a unified force, allowing the enemy's artillery fire to exert its power and specifically target densely packed formations. As a result, the cavalry lost contact, and the battle line was shaken. This is the third reason for the loss. Since the beginning of the battle, there have been no reinforcements or ammunition. Our army's artillery and equipment were originally not as sharp as the enemy's, especially when the enemy used heavy artillery to attack in rows. From a distance of 30 li, they could bombard our battle line. The field guns we had were only capable of firing up to 15 li at most. The enemy's heavy artillery made our field guns seem useless. The soldiers fought hard for more than ten days, lying in the trenches and daring not close their eyes day and night. The enemy army also knew that our army had no reinforcements to replace them, so they constantly harassed us with small teams to wear out our soldiers. Moreover, the enemy specifically attacked our weak spots. This is the fourth reason for the loss. When the fighting was fierce on the evening of the 17th, I planned to transfer two other infantry regiments from the Harbin-Manchuria Railway line to the front. But before the two regiments could arrive, the enemy used tanks to cover their attack and broke through our right flank. This is the fifth reason for the loss. If I had sufficient troops, I would have counterattacked long ago, and would not have waited for the enemy to launch a fierce attack and for our army to defend to the death. Some soldiers were afraid of the enemy, so I warned them that Japanese soldiers are also just people, and we are also just people. What is there to fear between people? When airplanes come to drop bombs, we should scatter and lie down facing upwards to shoot, and not panic or run away. Once you are on the battle line, there is no safe zone. Therefore, the soldiers followed my instructions and fought against the enemy with a common hatred for many days. When the front line was in an emergency, Chief Zhang (Jinghui) called several times, saying that no matter what, the soldiers should retreat first, but Xiufang (Ma's given name), you must not retreat. Stay in the provincial capital and meet with the Japanese to discuss a solution. I replied that Fourth Master (Jinghui) is an old senior official in the Northeast, and I dare not disobey his orders. But Ma Zhanshan believes that he is a good man and will never surrender to Japan. If Fourth Master surrenders to Japan, then everyone has their own ambitions and there is no need to force each other. If Fourth Master is entrusted by Japan to govern Heilongjiang, I will not counterattack in principle, but there must be no Japanese around me. If Japanese people are still used as advisors, or if Japanese soldiers are still stationed in the provincial capital, then Fourth Master is equal to surrendering to Japan, and Zhanshan will treat you as enemies, and do my best to deal with you. Afterwards, when our army retreated here, Chief Zhang (Jinghui) sent two representatives to see me (Zhang Lanjun and Li Hanchuan) to ask for my understanding and to explain the reasons why he had to go to Heilongjiang. I still replied as before and told them that if Fourth Master is not controlled by the Japanese, then I am willing to accept all orders. Otherwise, I am a slave of a slave under the control of a subjugated country, and I will never do that. I can only fight to the end. The two representatives left with shame and were reportedly cursed by the passengers in the Hulan-Hailun train. This shows that the spirit of the people has not completely subsided. At this point in the conversation, it was getting late, and there were many staff members of Mr. Ma waiting for orders and instructions, so I said goodbye and returned to my residence.</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan's Firm Statement: On the afternoon of the 28th, at about 2:00 p.m., I visited Chairman Ma Zhanshan again. After reporting my arrival, I was immediately received. At that time, Mr. Ma was instructing Li Xianzhang, the deputy chief of the Third Brigade, on a matter. I was able to hear the matter because Jiao, the regimental commander of Zhang Dianjiu's unit stationed at Anda Station, had sent a telegram saying that more than 1,000 bandits had gathered between Anguang and Tailai, requesting to be reorganized. Ma ordered Li to tell Jiao that if the bandits were sincere in resisting Japan, they must first take action and then be allowed to reorganize. Otherwise, they must not make excessive demands, disturb the people, or extort money. They should be stationed between Anda and Tailai and await orders before taking action together. After Li left, many gentry and business leaders from Helen requested to see him. After Mr. Ma let them in, they were pleading for a certain Squad Leader Jiang of a security company. Because when the Black Army retreated, there was a lot of luggage, so security teams from various counties were mobilized to transport it. Jiang even took bribes to release civilian vehicles and steal ammunition and equipment. After Ma found out, he questioned the laborers. One laborer told Ma, "Our country has come to such a point that the people should do their best, so even though my family has spent some money to obtain the release of Jiang, I am still willing to do my best for the government out of righteous indignation." Ma was moved to tears when he heard this, and therefore hated Jiang very much. Earlier that morning, he had sent a team to arrest Jiang and hand him over to the military court for trial. Several gentry had been requesting for a long time for this, but Ma refused, saying that if he was not severely punished, how could he maintain law and order and discipline the army? The crowd requested for a long time, but they left without any result. After the others left, Ma spoke to me, saying, "The people of our country often hate the bullying of foreigners. They must know that the bullying of foreigners is mostly due to our own faults. Look at this matter, what situation is our army in now, and this unscrupulous person is still doing this selfish act? The reason why Japan dares to fight China and oppress us to such an extent is mostly because people are selfish and cannot cooperate with each other. Otherwise, what is there to fear from Japanese soldiers? Even comparing the soldiers individually, although our army is weak, its combat effectiveness is not inferior to the enemy. However, our morale and material resources are not as good as theirs. In the battles of Daxing and Tangchi, the Japanese army was surrounded by our army, and they even abandoned their armor and weapons, and fled while crying. Those who were captured by us were also weeping and shedding tears. How are they different from us?" At this point in the conversation, I asked about future plans. Ma said, "Regarding military actions, it is not convenient to disclose details, nor is it convenient to publish them in newspapers, so as not to attract the enemy's attention. What can be said at this moment is that our army will not attack hard targets or defend strongholds in the future, but will adopt a purely guerrilla nature. When the opportunity arises, we will bravely go for it. The Qiqihar-Koshih Road is mostly plains, and our army also lacks artillery. Therefore, after the replenishment is completed, we will pay attention to training cavalry. The provincial government is not fixed here either. If the situation forces us, or for the convenience of handling affairs, we may move to another location. If the Japanese army comes to pressure us now, we will still do our best to resist. Eastern Heilongjiang is my second hometown. I can find my way forward and backward even with my eyes closed. Even if the enemy comes to pressure us with all their might, I will not be afraid." As we talked about this, Su Bingwen, the garrison commander of Hailar, sent a quartermaster to report. Ma summoned him immediately. The quartermaster reported to Ma that Wu, the regimental commander of the Fourth Regiment of that brigade, was surrounded by the enemy in the middle of the night during the battle of Wuhu, and was cut in the left back of the head by the enemy. He pretended to be dead at the time and was later rescued by a soldier. He is currently being treated in the hospital and is no longer in danger of death. He also said that more than 100 Mongolian soldiers had entered Hailar on the evening of the 24th and had not yet taken any action. After Ma finished hearing the report, he immediately ordered him to return quickly and inform Su to replenish the troops and deal with the area along the Harbin-Manchuria Railway as he saw fit. At this point, someone else came to request an audience, so I excused myself.</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan's Family Situation: Ma is from Huaide, Liaoning. He currently resides in Helen. He is 48 years old, with three wives and one son and one daughter. His son, named Kui, courtesy name Ziyuan, is 27 years old and currently serves as the director of the tax collection bureau in Buxi County, Heilongjiang. His daughter is named Shuqin, and her husband is Dong, who recently returned from Japan after dropping out of school, according to reports. Ma started his career in the military, serving as a platoon, company, and battalion commander in Wu Junsheng's 29th Division, eventually becoming a regimental, brigade, and division commander. During the Second Zhili-Fengtian War in 1926, he served as the commander of the cavalry army. He is good at commanding cavalry and is able to defeat the few against the many. He once used 500 cavalry to pursue 10,000 Northwest Army soldiers in Zhangde, seizing half of their firearms. Therefore, throughout Wu Junsheng's life, he led the cavalry. He has been in the military for 30 years, and his official rank has risen step by step. He has never gone through official handover procedures. Whenever there is a battle, his spirits are high and his voice is loud. Even if he does not sleep for several days and nights, he shows no signs of fatigue. There is a saying in Heilongjiang Province: "Ma Xiaogezi is full of courage" (Xiaogezi refers to being short), which refers to Ma. (November 30th)</p>
<h3>A Record of the Inspection of Raoyang by the Tianjin-Beijing Press Corps (Continued)</h3>
<p>The Armored Car Team Bravely Kills the Enemy: At this time, the Zhongshan armored car of our Northeast Army's armored car team happened to be parked at Raoyanghe Station. Shen Shizhen, the commander of the car team, heard that the Japanese armored cars and troop trains were advancing westward with the intention of provoking trouble. He immediately sent an urgent telegram to Cao Yaozhang, the commander of the armored car team headquarters in Goubangzi, requesting instructions. After receiving instructions, he immediately blocked the Japanese army's advance at Raoyanghe Station. The Japanese armored car opened fire on our Zhongshan car at the No. 38 bridge, about half a li east of Raoyanghe Station. The Zhongshan car was hit by three shells. Fortunately, the car's structure was strong, and only the outer armored layer was damaged. The car body was not damaged. The car team commander, Shen Shizhen, then directed the counterattack. The two sides confronted each other for about two hours. The front of the Japanese armored car was destroyed, and a freight car was burned. The Japanese army was unable to hold out and began to retreat. At about 1:00 p.m., the Japanese troop train and armored car advanced again and met our Zhongshan car again in the Raoyanghe area. The Japanese side also sent seven aircraft to circle in the air and drop bombs on the Zhongshan car. The Japanese infantry and cavalry also got out of the train and took up an encircling formation on the left and right sides. After half an hour of bombardment, the Japanese artillery also got out of the train and set up artillery positions on the left and right flanks, firing at the Zhongshan car from three directions.

<h3>The Japanese Also Know the Dangers of Economic Blockade</h3>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, the Nagoya Shimbun newspaper of Japan published an editorial regarding the invocation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant for an economic blockade against Japan, stating, "The League of Nations should sever all commercial and financial ties with the violating nation and prohibit communication with the citizens of the violating nation." "If they do not comply with the League's agreement, they will be thoroughly punished." From this point of view, the economic chaos of the violating country is self-evident. If the League of Nations invokes this article against Japan in this Sino-Japanese dispute, our imports and exports will be cut off. Our country's foreign trade includes 1.4 billion yuan in exports and 1.5 billion yuan in imports, as well as 500 million yuan in extra-trade payments. All of this will come to a standstill. At that time, wouldn't our country be plunged into an abyss? Therefore, our country should observe this action from the following two points: (1) If the League of Nations implements an economic blockade against us, the 500 million yuan of cotton imports can be diverted elsewhere, but what should be done with the 700 million yuan in sales of our country's silk and cotton textiles? The United States is the main customer for our country's raw silk exports. Although the United States does not join the League of Nations, it will definitely have the same attitude as the League of Nations. This is one thing to worry about. (2) If the world economy is blocked, then on one hand, China will definitely break off economic ties with us. If that is the case, according to the calculation of the fifth year of Showa (1930), the trade with China includes 430 million yuan in exports and 283 million yuan in imports. If our country loses this path, the fundamental basis of the industry will be completely shaken. Moreover, the export amount to China, 400 million yuan, accounts for nearly 35% of our total exports. The cheap raw materials and daily necessities imported from China are beneficial to our country's industries. From now on, our country's industrial refined products will have no sales outlets. This is the second thing to worry about. However, our country's hard-liners have not taken these two points into consideration. Their ignorance of the national situation is too much.</p>
<h3>Student-Police Conflict in Xiangtan</h3>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Since the Northeast Incident occurred, the academic circles of Xiangtan organized the Xiangtan Branch of the Hunan Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and their work has been very active. At 6:00 PM on the 25th of last month, when the propaganda team of the First Middle School Student Self-Government Association was giving a speech in the Lequn Cinema, Chen Qihong, an employee of the Xiangtan Telegraph Bureau, did not want to listen to the students' speech for a long time, so he clapped his palms to stop it and shouted to show the movie quickly. The students were furious and took Chen to the County Public Security Bureau so that they could report to the Anti-Japanese Association for punishment. Xu Jingbang, the director of the Telegraph Bureau, received the news and immediately bailed him out from Sun Weihou, the chief of the judicial section of the Public Security Bureau, the next day. After the Anti-Japanese Association held a meeting on the 27th to decide on measures to punish Chen Qihong, two or three hundred students marched to the Public Security Bureau to demand Chen. Unexpectedly, Chen had already been released on bail. The students were in an uproar and ordered Sun Weihou to hand over the person. Sun could not respond. The students then took Sun to the County First Middle School, preparing to convene a conference to discuss the measures. At that time, Luo Kui, the commander of the Xiangtan Security Regiment, Chen Dayong, the director of the Education Bureau, and Miao Liren, the county magistrate, rushed to the scene after hearing the news and tried their best to mediate. As a result, Sun issued a written statement, agreeing to hand over Chen Qihong before 10:00 AM on the 28th. The next day (the 28th), hundreds of students went to the Public Security Bureau on time. Director Liu Yicheng came out to negotiate and said that he had ordered the guarantor to hand over the person, but had not yet received him. At this time, Sun Weihou saw that the students' situation was turbulent, fearing that the turmoil would become big, so he took the opportunity to leave the bureau, intending to go to the County Party Headquarters to discuss measures. Unexpectedly, he was spotted by the students, chased him on the way, and took Sun back, accusing him of releasing people after accepting bribes. They still took Sun back to the Public Security Bureau and ordered him to hand over the person. When the students were chasing and taking Sun Weihou, Liu Yicheng, the director of the Public Security Bureau, was very dissatisfied, thinking that the students were relying on the crowd to act violently and were too insulting. After the student team took Sun to the bureau, the armed police in the bureau immediately assembled and surrounded the students. For a time, the order was in chaos. The police officers fired shots into the air to demonstrate, and stabbed the students with bayonets. As a result, two students were arrested (Luo Weian and Deng Guoguang), and more than 20 were injured (Tang Xinmin, Fu Mingyang, Pang Changchi, Liu Xuanang, Huang Zhixiu, Guo Wenfeng, Tan Hui, He Jinzhang, He , Feng Renzhi, He Zhihou, Hu Dahui, Huang Xu, Huang Qiu, Chen Cong, Li Zhenkun, Feng Shuchun, Zhu Xunqing, etc. It is reported that Huang Xu and He Wen were the most seriously injured and may be in danger of their lives). After this tragedy occurred, all the police officers in the city went on strike and concentrated in the Public Security Bureau. All the students in the county also went on strike and concentrated in the Student Union. The situation was very tense. The provincial government has now sent Secretary Yang Jisun to investigate in order to decide how to deal with it. (December 2nd)</p>
<h3>The Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou After Hu Hanmin Returned to Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Ninth Meeting Initially Selected Central Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>Hu, Wu and Others Proposed New System for Party, Government, and Military Affairs</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: After the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session passed the motion to accept the Hu-Wu proposal and abandon the resolution to overturn the Shanghai Peace Conference at the Seventh Congress on the 1st of this month, Hu Hanmin returned to the province on the 2nd with Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Chen Youren, Wu Chaoshu, and others. At about 1:00 PM that afternoon, the Kowloon-Canton Railway special train arrived at Dashatou Station, and people from all walks of life in the military and government welcomed them at the station. Among those who accompanied Hu and others were also Chuan Bingchang, Bai Chongxi, Huang Huilong, and 20 to 30 representatives who had withdrawn from the Fourth Plenary Session a few days ago. After arriving in the province, Hu and others went to Yulu in Ershatou for a temporary rest and then held a discussion meeting in Yulu. Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Ma Chaojun, Deng Qingyang, Shi Qingyang were present. During the meeting, they discussed how to solve party affairs, military affairs, and politics in the future, as well as major plans to deal with the current situation. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM. Hu Hanmin and Sun Ke visited Deng Zheru and Xiao Focheng at about 3:00 PM and talked for a long time. Today (the 3rd), at 9:00 AM, the Fourth Plenary Session held its ninth meeting in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, with 340 representatives present and 96 representatives attending. The members of the presidium who attended were Xiao Focheng, Deng Zheru, Li Zongren, Jing Hengyi, Li Yangjing, Huang Xuchu, Guan Suren, Yao Chang. After the ceremony, the discussion began. The following motions were resolved: (1) To add Hu Hanmin and Wu Chaoshu as chairmen of the presidium; (2) To elect members of the motion sorting committee, nominated by the presidium, and each group review meeting to be responsible for recommending one person each, for a total of nine people, to be the motion sorting committee; (3) To elect 12 ballot markers, 6 ballot counters, 6 ballot monitors, and 6 ballot monitors; (4) Representatives introduced candidates for the fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members. Ballots were immediately issued and the election began. As a result, the following candidates were elected: Qu Fangpu (230 votes), Xiang Hanping (230 votes), Yu Hanmou (228 votes), Huang Jilu (196 votes), Huang Tongchou (177 votes), Li Pinxian (173 votes), Li Renren (158 votes), Lu Yougang (149 votes), Xie Yingzhou (145 votes), Huang Heli (136 votes), Zhan Jusi (128 votes), Chen Zhongfu (116 votes), Wang Baozhen (104 votes), Lin Wanjuan (97 votes), Gao Fang (94 votes), Pei Mingyu (94 votes), Cui Guangxiu (94 votes), Cao Wusi (93 votes), Wu Zhimei (88 votes), Li Qian (69 votes), Chen Jianru (65 votes), Wang Kunlun (63 votes), Zhong Tianxin (59 votes), Yang Aiyuan (59 votes), for a total of 24 people.

At 2:00 PM, the tenth meeting continued, with 396 representatives present and 112 representatives attending. Li Yangjing, the chairman, announced the start of the discussion of the proposal. The presidium proposed the proposals of the four members Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, and Li Zongren: 1. In order to clarify politics and prevent dictatorship, a political affairs committee should be established above the provincial political savings to supervise the administration of the provinces under the guidance of the National Government, the details of which shall be stipulated by the National Government; 2. Under the guidance of the Central Executive Committee, an executive department should be established in important locations to supervise the party headquarters of the provinces and cities respectively, the details of which shall be stipulated by the Central Executive Committee; 3. For the sake of national defense and bandit suppression, military sub-committees should be established in necessary locations under the guidance of the Military Affairs Committee, the details of which shall be stipulated by the National Government. As a result, it was unanimously passed. (2) Sun Ke and Li Zongren proposed that the National Government allocate a portion of the national tax to repay the revolutionary debts at home and abroad over the years. The method is that the central government should order the National Government to allocate a portion of the national tax revenue and store it specially for the purpose of repaying the revolutionary debts at home and abroad over the years. Once the investigation of these debts is completed, all those that can be verified should be repaid with this stored money. As a result, it was unanimously passed. (4) For the sake of Committee Member Gu Xiangqin's dedication to the revolution and meritorious service to the party and the country, it is proposed that the Congress decide that the National Government should issue a clear order to open Xiangqin Middle School, with attached primary school and kindergarten, to commemorate it permanently. It was unanimously passed. At this time, it was already 5:00 PM in the evening, so the meeting adjourned. (December 3rd evening)</p>
<p>Appendix: The Hu-Wu proposal is as follows: To the Presidium and all comrades of the Fourth National Congress: There have been misunderstandings about the resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference at this Fourth Plenary Session, which has caused some twists and turns in the proceedings of the Fourth Plenary Session. All of our comrades regret this. In my opinion, the outcome of the peace talks cannot be considered to be fully satisfactory to us. There is no denying this. However, at a time when the Northeast is being invaded by the violent Japanese, the people of the whole country are extremely eager for the early realization of a unified government so that the whole country can unite against foreign aggression. Our peace talk representatives in Shanghai are in this environment, so they only seek to be consistent in principle with the purpose of the Ma-Ma telegrams of the National Government, especially that the dictatorial system cannot exist, then other things may as well be conceded. This has its own unavoidable difficulties. However, our party takes the construction of a democratic politics as its responsibility, then the wishes of the people should not be excessively violated, and the will of the people of the country should be respected. The so-called "inch of land of the people" by the late premier is the territory of our party. This is the first thing that should be noted. The comrades in Guangdong have been able to unite sincerely in the past few months, so there is today's situation. Those who oppose it think of destroying it. Their most vicious means is to split it up. However, they have tried every possible means and cannot use their tricks. Now, if we do what they cannot do, even if we are foolish, we will never do this. This is the second thing that should be noted. If we understand these two points, then the current difficulties will not be difficult to solve. Moreover, after careful study of the resolutions of the peace talks, there is no conflict with the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session. I humbly propose three measures as follows: (A) The 112 members of the first, second, and third Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, and alternate Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members, excluding communists and reactionaries, shall be nominated by the Presidium and submitted to the Fourth Plenary Session for the fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members and alternate Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members for approval. If it is said to be necessary, it can also be stated that this is an unavoidable move to seek peace and unity. I humbly note that (1) what the Congress is dealing with is that the members of the first, second, and third sessions are the natural members of the fourth session. However, the peace conference did not have this resolution. The resolution of the peace conference on November 7th was "Both sides should negotiate the method of producing candidates for the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members." The agreement reached during the talks between the representatives of the peace conference was "The total number of Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members is 160. The Central Committee members and alternate members of the first, second, and third sessions, excluding communists, shall be elected unanimously, but it is not necessary to use the name of the Central Committee members of the first, second, and third sessions, for a total of 112 people. The remaining 48 people shall be freely elected by both sides with 24 people each, and the elections shall be mutually recognized." Therefore, there was no so-called natural member from beginning to end. (2) The 112 Central Committee members of the first, second, and third sessions are nominated by the Presidium and approved by the Congress. On the one hand, the election rights of the Congress are respected, and on the other hand, the great unity of our party is sought. In the meantime, there may inevitably be people who are dissatisfied with the representatives. However, the party's heartfelt desire to regain the unity of our party is shared and understood by all comrades in the party. If a statement is made, this heartfelt desire will be even more obvious. (B) In addition to the above-mentioned 112 people, the Congress shall elect 24 people. As for the 24 people elected by the Ning faction, the Congress shall decide that the first plenary session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee may approve it with a two-thirds resolution. I humbly note that the 24 people elected by the Ning faction may not be approved by the Congress, but the Congress passed a resolution the day before yesterday "Jiang must step down and relinquish his military power. If Jiang does not step down, the Central Party Headquarters shall be organized in Guangdong," etc. If Jiang does not step down, and the Congress approves the 24 people elected by the Ning faction, it will only help Jiang. Therefore, it is better to authorize the Fourth Central Executive Committee to approve it, which seems more appropriate and does not harm the Congress's right to elect Central Committee members. It is necessary to have a two-thirds resolution of the conference to avoid the unilateral approval of the Central Committee members of the Ning faction. (C) On the day of the resolution, all party members who have been expelled from the party by the Congress or the Central Executive Committee due to political relations, except for communists, shall be reinstated as party members. I humbly note that since the great unity of our party is sought, all party members who have been expelled due to political relations should be reinstated as party members. The Ning faction has already taken this measure. Our Congress should show generosity and not lag behind others. Moreover, this point is not without relation to the election of our Central Committee members of the first, second, and third sessions. The above three humbly proposed measures are all based on the above-mentioned two points that should be noted: one is to seek the peaceful unity of the country, and the other is to seek the sincere unity of comrades. Whether or not they are appropriate, I hope that they will be adopted. I respectfully wish the Party all the best. Respectfully, Hu Hanmin and Wu Chaoshu.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>The whole story of the destruction of the Public Security Bureau. The County Public Security Bureau was destroyed by rioters yesterday because it prohibited the race meeting. It is learned that at about 6:00 PM last night (the 4th), the bureau received a report that a large-scale race meeting of Lord Jiang Wang of Daoyuan Bay was passing through Nanqiao. Considering that it was during the winter defense period and related to public security, it immediately sent patrol chief Wang Mei to stop it and advise them to change from South Street to enter the town. Unexpectedly, the crowd resisted and beat the police on the spot. On the one hand, they rushed straight into the street market and shouted loudly. The police could not prevent it, so they fired a shot into the air at the junction of Jiahe Lane to avoid danger. Unexpectedly, the crowd was angered and immediately gathered five or six hundred people, forcibly carried the statues of gods, and rushed to the bureau to surround it and make trouble. Director Li Zhibin personally came out to guide them, but they turned a deaf ear and many people came forward to beat him, destroying almost all the doors, windows, equipment, documents, and other items of the bureau. Later, County Magistrate Shen Qingchen led the police to the scene to suppress them. At the same time, Weng Zuguang, a member of the county executive committee, and Shen Menglian, a local gentleman, also arrived after hearing the news and politely persuaded them. They also invited representatives of the crowd to explain the advantages and disadvantages, and then they dispersed. Now, the County Public Security Bureau has found out the exact number of losses, totaling about two thousand several hundred yuan, including the construction of one branch bureau and the personal clothes of the police. As for the follow-up measures, the county government convened an emergency local meeting yesterday to discuss the results. They all agreed that the crowd had misunderstood the matter and should be forgiven for their ignorance. In addition to exempting them from further investigation, all the public losses should be compensated by the six fang of the council, and the riotous rioters should be investigated by the Public Security Bureau to find out the leaders, arrest them, and severely punish them to maintain law and order.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Various Organizations Solicit Donations to Aid the Horse Soldiers. The violent Japanese invaded and occupied Shenyang. The soldiers who were responsible for defending the territory retreated step by step with a policy of non-resistance. In a few days, the territory of Liaoning and Jilin was completely occupied by the invaders. Unexpectedly, Ma Zhanshan, the acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province, led an isolated army to fight for the survival of the country and the nation, and raised his arms to resist. China and foreign countries were shocked and alarmed. He repeatedly frustrated the Japanese invaders. His righteousness was as high as the sky. The various circles of this county, in order to encourage morale, had the county party headquarters and the county government make and print donation books, which were distributed to various organs and organizations to solicit donations. The Provincial Women's Middle School Experimental Primary School held a recreational conference last night, and all the proceeds from the ticket sales were remitted to General Ma of Hailun to pay for the military expenses. I think patriotic people will have the righteousness to destroy their families and relieve the country's difficulties.</p>
<p>Business accounts will be closed at the end of January. According to business customs, the closing date of business accounts is traditionally the Lunar New Year's Eve. Since the implementation of the National Calendar last year, there have been slight changes according to the convenience of the environment. The closing date of this year's business accounts has been tentatively set by the higher authorities to be at the end of January to show uniformity. After receiving the order, the County Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various trade associations, notifying the various merchants to comply with it.</p>

<p>The Provincial Government Thoroughly Investigates the Restaurant Banquet Donation Turmoil. The restaurant industry in Wu County opposed the surrogate banquet donation, causing a turmoil. The Public Security Bureau believed that it was deliberately resisting taxes and arrested the representative of the industry, Wang Xiangbao, and others. It has been a week since they were arrested and have not been released. The industry also did not ask for bail and let it be. On the one hand, they submitted requests for assistance to various agencies. The County Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting them to send someone to investigate and handle the case quickly. The Jiangsu Provincial Government instructed the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday (the 7th), saying that the Eastern Telegraph knew that the restaurant industry had telegraphed directly yesterday, and the two departments of finance and education had been ordered to investigate and handle the case. Wait for the order of the department to review and handle it quickly. You should immediately advise the various industries to wait quietly for the committee to investigate and not to cause disturbances.

<p>Robbers were captured late at night. Shen Guanghan, the commander of the 60th Division stationed in Suzhou, personally led his guards to patrol outside in recent days because robbery cases have occurred in Suzhou for days in a row, and all the robbers are holding guns, which is related to local public security. At about 11:00 PM on the 6th, he saw a person on Liuyuan Road whose appearance was suspicious and ordered him to stop. Unexpectedly, this person opened fire, so the guards also returned fire. This person was shot and fell to the ground and was immediately arrested. According to his confession, his name was Pan Guifang. Two women were also arrested.

<p>Opposition to Collecting Electricity Deposit. Qian Zhongliang, the chief of the first district, is against the Qishuyan Power Plant's recent collection of deposits from electricity users, which has aroused opposition from the citizens. It is found that electricity is originally a public utility, which can be handled by autonomous organs according to laws and regulations. As for the deposit, according to the situation in this district, it will cost more than 100,000 yuan. If the factory forcibly collects it, it will only have to raise funds to run it on its own. Now that it belongs to the Construction Committee, it is not necessary to pay the deposit again if the electricity users pay monthly fees. Moreover, the Qi Factory has been open for many years and has never collected deposits. This sudden implementation has not been announced. Is it an order from the higher authorities, a new system, or a self-determined method? The people of the district are suspicious and will naturally ask for its basis in order to seek a solution. This office believes that if the collection of this deposit is due to the intention of the Qi Factory's personnel and there is a behavioral expression, and a small part has already been collected, then please take into account the public's opinion and cancel it on your own, and return the collected money. If it is to implement the order or system regulations of the higher authorities, and it is a year of famine and the society is shrinking, please also convey the situation below to the higher authorities and postpone the implementation, so that the laws, regulations, and human feelings can be taken care of both. Yesterday, a letter was specially sent to the Qi Factory for reference. At the same time, the town and district chief also received a public letter from dozens of households, including Zhang Zheng, an electricity user in the urban area, who advocated something about this issue and requested that it be forwarded to the Qi Factory to withdraw the order.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Provincial Order to Borrow 70,000 Yuan from the Grain Transport. Jiangyin suffered a major flood this year. Due to the current situation, credit is extremely tight and business is bleak. Last month, the Finance Bureau and the Education Bureau presented to the provincial government with the county government because the local education funds were strained and there was no way to raise funds. The provincial government approved the temporary issuance of local education IOUs for 12,000 yuan each, estimated to deduct interest at a rate of 1% for three months, and approved the completion of the second phase land price tax payment. Currently, most of the commercial firms and institutions and schools try to postpone payment with these IOUs, which makes commercial finance even more urgent. The dismantling interest rate last month was 6.5%, and this month it has not yet been released. According to news in the money industry, the dismantling interest rate may increase within these two months. A few days ago, Magistrate Ma went to the province. The provincial government needed funds for the transportation project and orally ordered that 70,000 yuan be borrowed from the grain transport by the end of this month after returning to Cheng. Ma and the Finance Bureau met yesterday (the 5th) and decided to convene the rich merchants to raise funds. However, it is very difficult to proceed due to the current tight credit.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Important News: Telegram from the National Student Anti-Japanese Federation</h3>
<p>The National Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation issued a telegram, which was forwarded by the Shanghai newspapers to all schools and organizations across the country for consideration. The clash between the Peking University demonstration group and the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters on this occasion was, on the one hand, the Garrison Department oppressed the people, and the measures were particularly inappropriate. All the people of our country should unanimously oppose it. On the other hand, the Peking University demonstration group was not organized by all the students of Peking University, and its actions and speeches in Nanjing went beyond the scope of anti-Japanese national salvation, and were obviously manipulated by a few deteriorating elements, which greatly affected the future of the patriotic movement. All the students of our country and all compatriots should pay serious attention to it, and must not allow the anti-Japanese movement to become a pro-Russian movement. Therefore, we should, while opposing the government's loss of power and humiliation of the country, try our best to prevent the activities of the deteriorating elements. The movement after the May 30th Massacre can be used as a lesson. I hope that all the students of our country and all compatriots will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Faculty and Staff of the College of Agriculture of Zhejiang University to Gu Weijun</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Faculty and Staff of the College of Agriculture of National Zhejiang University telegraphed Foreign Minister Gu on the urgent diplomatic situation in recent days. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Nanjing Foreign Ministry Minister Gu Jian, the recent Sino-Japanese negotiations seem to have taken a sharp turn for the worse. The issue of the neutral zone is rife in the League of Nations. May I ask whether the proposal to establish a neutral zone within our country can be tolerated. Has your Excellency telegraphed Representative Shi that this proposal can be accepted? Please give a clear answer. This is the first. Recently, Chongguang went to Beijing to meet with Your Excellency. What was it for? Does our country want to abandon the principle of not negotiating without the withdrawal of Japanese troops? Please give a clear answer. This is the second. The above two points are full of doubts. At this time, when the people of the whole country are heartbroken and determined to resist Japan, aid Heilongjiang, and strive to recover the lost land, there is news at home and abroad that the proposal to establish a neutral zone has been accepted, and there is a situation where negotiations will be held without the withdrawal of Japanese troops, which violates the will of the people of the whole country. Please pay attention to this and do not lose power and humiliate the country due to a moment of difference and put our country in an irrecoverable situation. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Faculty and Staff of the College of Agriculture of Zhejiang University Jiang.</p>

<h3>Various Universities Telegraph the National Government Yesterday, Requesting the Release of Peking University Students</h3>
<p>丨And Enforce Revolutionary Diplomacy丨</p>
<p>The National Government is Limited to Respond Within 24 Hours</p>
<p>丨Resolution of Yesterday's Representatives' Conference丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Universities' Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held its 20th Representatives' Conference at the Ximen Juvenile Propaganda Corps at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than 30 representatives from various schools attended. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives and Schools Represented: Daxia University, Law School of Xinhua Art College, Traditional Chinese Medicine College, Soochow University, Jiaotong University, Shanghai University, Datong University, Guanghua University, Sino-French Pharmaceutical College, Tongde Medical College, Zhengfeng School, National Medical College, China Medical College, Renhe Midwifery School, Wenhua University, St. John's University, China Physical Education College, Jinan University, Dongya University, Shanghai Art College, Sino-French Institute of Technology, Southeast University, Fudan University, Zhonggong School, Liangjiang School, Merchant Marine College, Jiangnan School, Shanghai Art College, etc. Chairman: Xu Guanbin from Daxia University; Recorder: Tang Hansheng from the Law School.</p>
<p>Conference Proceedings: After performing the ceremony, the chairman reported on various work situations. Then, a representative from Nanjing Central University reported on the assistance to the arrested students of Peking University, as well as the situation of Central University students being arrested and injured. All representatives at the venue felt extremely indignant. The discussion then began, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Telegraph the government to demand the immediate release of the arrested students and enforce revolutionary diplomacy; (2) Oppose direct negotiations; (3) Oppose the establishment of a neutral zone; (4) Oppose the co-management of Tianjin; (5) Oppose the investigation team coming to China; (6) Oppose Gu Weijun serving as the head of diplomacy (The above telegrams require a response within 24 hours); (7) If the government does not provide a satisfactory response within 24 hours, then lead 30,000 students from the city to Nanjing, and telegraph the whole country to strike from classes unanimously; (8) In the telegram to the government, indicate to the government to decide on the shortest period for dispatching troops; (9) Ask the government to explain the reasons for the arrest of the students, and the inappropriate points of the slogans and banners; (10) Send representatives from Fudan University and Jiaotong University to negotiate with the authorities of the National Medical College to stop the illegal actions of preventing students' patriotic movements; (11) Telegraph the French student association, asking them to prevent Shi Zhaoji from signing humiliating treaties, otherwise, deal with him in the same way that domestic students dealt with Wang Zhengting; (12) Determine the date for the next representatives' conference to be the day after tomorrow. The meeting adjourned at about 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Nanjing National Government: Alas, today's China is in a state of crisis, like a pile of eggs in danger. Liaoning and Jilin were occupied in the past, and Heilongjiang has fallen since then. The voices for the neutrality of Jinzhou and the co-management of Tianjin are rising higher and higher. What is even more noteworthy is the proposal for an investigation team to come to China before the Japanese troops have withdrawn, and the momentum for direct negotiations before the lost territories have been recovered. All of this is because the government has failed to fulfill its responsibility to protect the country and secure the people, the military has failed to fulfill its duty to defend the territory, and the diplomats have failed to fulfill their ability to enforce revolutionary diplomacy, thus causing this situation. At this critical moment of survival, the survival of the nation is closely related. Since the government cannot fulfill its responsibilities, the people should, according to the principles of democratic politics, exercise their right to petition on national affairs, and exercise their right to self-defense in times of crisis, as well as other rights to march and demonstrate, etc. Based on the above reasons, we demand that the government immediately release the arrested students of Peking University and Central University in Nanjing, and enforce revolutionary diplomacy, and allow the following seven requests: (1) Oppose direct negotiations; (2) Oppose the establishment of a neutral zone; (3) Oppose the co-management of Tianjin; (4) Oppose the investigation team coming to China; (5) Oppose Gu Weijun serving as the head of diplomacy; (6) Determine the shortest period for dispatching troops; (7) Explain the reasons for the arrest of the students and the inappropriate points of their slogans and banners. The above seven points require the government to respond within 24 hours. If there is no satisfactory response, it means that the government is isolating itself from the people, not that the people are isolating themselves from the government. We will adopt the unavoidable means of leading 30,000 students from the city to Nanjing, and telegraph the whole country to strike from classes unanimously, to deal with the government. Presentation. Thinking of this, we cannot help but feel heartbroken. We hope that this final step will not be taken. If it is necessary to take this step, then the numbness and insensitivity of our government can be known, and the corruption of the national army is even more evident. As the ancients said, "Support me and I will make you my sovereign; abuse me and I will make you my enemy." We ask to change it to, "Defend me and I will be your friend; endanger me and I will be your enemy." We hope that you will pay attention to this. Respectfully reported, Shanghai Universities' Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association kowtows. According to the above telegram, the Middle School Joint Association is also named.</p>
<h3>Middle School Students Decided to Strike from Classes Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Representatives' Conference Discussed Organizing a Strike Picket Team</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Middle Schools in this city held an emergency representatives' conference the day before yesterday, and decided to issue a notice to all middle schools in the city to strike from classes to promote the government's dispatch of troops to resist Japan. Middle schools have started striking from classes yesterday, and the sixth representatives' conference was held at Shanghai Middle School in the afternoon to discuss the work after the strike and the situation of the strike picket in various schools. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Strike Situation: From yesterday, more than 50 middle schools in the city have implemented the strike according to the order of the Middle School Joint Association. However, Wuben, Qixiu, and Datong schools did not strike because they had not received the news beforehand. The anti-Japanese associations of various schools also ordered students not to indulge in pleasure after the strike, and still have to go to school every day to engage in national salvation work.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Conference: The sixth representatives' conference was held after 2:00 PM yesterday, with 42 middle schools attending. Li Bin from Huiling, Chen Liyan from Gongshi, and Fang Mo from Zhengfeng served as chairmen, and Yi Bi from Minli Girls' Middle School recorded the minutes. The following resolutions were passed: (A) How should the work after the strike be carried out? Resolved: (1) During the strike, hold regular expanded propaganda; (2) Intensify military training; (3) Regularly send representatives to visit Wang Jingwei.

<h3>The Intention of the Shanghai Municipal Council to Amend the Regulations on Subsidizing Private Schools (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>A member of the Education Committee also cited the opinions in Judge Feitang's report, saying that the Shanghai Municipal Council should not subsidize schools that advocate international antagonism. The current provision is intended to avoid this situation. Judge Feitang's report stated: "Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's management of its established schools and assistance to other national or private schools, I believe there should be a condition that if any new educational policy regulations are added, it should be sufficient to protect the interests of the entire settlement. This condition is that any plan to manage schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council or to subsidize private schools, whether foreign or Chinese, must not have any teaching that causes mutual hatred between countries and nationalities. If we look at the textbooks used in some schools today, this condition is indeed not considered an overestimation. The foundation of the Public Concession is international cooperation, not only cooperation between foreigners, but also cooperation between foreigners and Chinese. The Shanghai Municipal Council is organized by representatives of various countries to perform its duties for the common interests of all parties. If it intentionally or tacitly uses a portion of its tax revenue to provide for certain schools, while these schools teach their students of various nationalities to regard each other as historical traditional enemies, or to regard hating people of other countries as the greatest responsibility of the nation, wouldn't this be very inappropriate? International cooperation in the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot be based on international hatred in schools. Therefore, all propaganda against one country or several countries should be prohibited. Although in fact, this prohibition may not be fully and effectively implemented, the principle has been publicly recognized, which is sufficient to be a safeguard and a major step towards the right path."</p>
<p>Now that this article has become a part of the Shanghai Municipal Council's educational policy, the discussion can be said to have had a satisfactory effect. It is hoped that schools of all nationalities will abide by this provision.</p>
<p>After the above issues were resolved, the Shanghai Municipal Council sent a letter to Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun as follows based on the recommendation of the Education Committee:</p>
<p>"Dear Sir, at the last taxpayers' meeting, the Council was authorized to allocate funds to subsidize private schools in the concession with improved teaching and insufficient funding, in order to develop the education of children residing in the concession. The regulations for this subsidy have now been drafted and are hereby submitted. According to the provisions of these regulations, the private schools must comply with the national educational standards of the majority of students in the school, and for Chinese schools, it is specifically stated that they should comply with the regulations and standards of the Chinese government. The issuance of this subsidy will be based on the recommendations of the Chinese members of the Council's Education Committee, and regarding the selection of Chinese schools, the committee hopes that your Municipal Education Bureau will make recommendations. Chinese schools wishing to obtain subsidies may be directed to apply directly to the Education Bureau, which will add comments and forward them to the Council's Education Committee. However, not all schools recommended by the Education Bureau may receive subsidies, and schools that have not been recommended may also be granted subsidies in special circumstances. However, the opinions of the Director of Education must be carefully considered by our Education Committee. The Council firmly believes that the implementation of this cooperative approach will enhance mutual understanding and goodwill between the two parties. We sincerely hope that your Mayor will agree and assist." Regarding the implementation of the educational regulations, which include subsidizing Chinese private schools, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently stated at a board meeting that the Council's Education Committee is willing to cooperate with the Chinese education authorities to implement these regulations. He stated that all members of the committee unanimously advocated that Chinese private schools in the concession should be placed under the jurisdiction of the Chinese education authorities as much as possible. The basis for cooperation with the Chinese side has been recorded in detail in the board minutes. Proceeding along this direction, it seems that the Shanghai Municipal Council is unwilling to manage Chinese schools, but the Education Committee believes that with the aforementioned safeguards, this policy will be beneficial to both Chinese and foreign residents. The board of directors unanimously adopted the policy advocated by the committee (end).</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Shanghai Universities' Professors' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Universities' Professors' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, in view of the urgent situation, held a temporary general assembly at the Soochow Law School at 2:00 PM on the 6th, and passed various important resolutions, and issued the following telegrams: (1) To the Nanjing National Government, requesting that petitions be based on patriotic enthusiasm, and publication be a right belonging to the people. Please immediately release the arrested students, withdraw the order prohibiting petitions, stop censoring news, and not suppress any anti-Japanese national salvation movement. If you go against public opinion, you will be isolating yourselves from the people of the country; (2) To the Nanjing Central Party Department, forwarded to the Special Foreign Affairs Committee, the strategy towards Japan is hesitant and uncertain, Representative Shi's sudden change of attitude, and Foreign Minister Gu's direct negotiations are indeed against public opinion. The responsibility of your committee lies in urgently remedying the situation, otherwise, the crime of harming the country cannot be atoned for even with ten thousand deaths. This is a special warning, Shanghai Universities' Professors' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association kowtows.</p>

<h3>Wang and Zou Telegraphed Both Nanjing and Guangdong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Motives for the Shanghai-Guangdong Central Committee Members to Go to Nanjing</p>
<p>Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei and Zou Lu received a telegram from Cai Yuanpei and others in Nanjing on the 6th. Yesterday, they specifically telegraphed Guangdong representatives Sun Ke, Wu Chaochu, etc., saying, "To Guangzhou Sun Zhesheng, Wu Tiyun, Li Junpei, Chen Youren, and other gentlemen: We have just received a telegram from Nanjing as follows: 'The national crisis is becoming more and more urgent. If peaceful unification is not achieved thoroughly and quickly, there will be no way to comfort the people's aspirations or save the party and the country from danger. The Fourth Plenary Session has now concluded, and the Fourth Central Committee has been elected. We earnestly request that, based on the decisions of the Shanghai meeting, you immediately convene all Central Committee members nearby, gather in Nanjing, and hold the first plenary session to resolve all party, government, and military issues, and establish a unified government that is consistent in dealing with foreign affairs. The survival of the party and the country depends on it. Comrades here plan to hold the first meeting in mid-month. We deeply hope that you will go to Nanjing as soon as possible in order to prepare everything. We are deeply grateful. Cai Yuanpei, Li Yuying, Zhang Ji, Zhang Renjie, Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, all bow.' We respectfully report and hope you will inform your colleagues in Guangdong when you will depart, and please reply." Wang Zhaoming and Zou Lu also replied to Cai and others at the same time, saying, "To Nanjing Cai Jiemin, Li Shizeng, Zhang Puquan, Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Zhenru, Wu Tiecheng, and other gentlemen: We have received your telegram with respect. We have immediately telegraphed Guangzhou and have also invited colleagues in Shanghai and elsewhere. When the Guangzhou colleagues arrive, we will go to Nanjing together. We hereby reply in advance." Wang Zhaoming and Zou Lu.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Talk</h3>
<p>Regarding the Conflict Between Students and the Authorities</p>
<p>Organizing a Representative Conference of Mass Organizations</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters, concerned about the recent conflicts between students and government authorities in various places, fearing unexpected disputes, especially visited Mr. Wang Jingwei at his residence to inquire about his views on this matter. He replied as follows: (Reporter asked) Recently, various Chinese and foreign newspapers have published rumors about Jinzhou being designated as a neutral zone and Tianjin being placed under joint administration, leading students in various places to petition, resulting in conflicts with the police, railways, and educational authorities. Public opinion on the students' actions varies, with some praising their patriotism and others criticizing their overstepping. I wonder what your opinion is on this? (Mr. Wang replied) My opinion is roughly as seen in my talk with student representatives in Nanjing yesterday. However, there is still something I would like to ask everyone to pay attention to, that is, the public's advocacy of a tough stance towards foreign countries is often regarded as irresponsible high-sounding talk. I believe that foreign policy should indeed be very cautious, but if foreign countries force us too much, putting our country in a situation where both advancing and retreating lead to danger and destruction, then our people must resolutely decide to die heroically rather than live in humiliation. This determination is indeed reasonable and should not be denigrated, because if we unfortunately lose the war, leading to the destruction of our country and homes, this huge loss will be borne by the people themselves. The people dare to advocate a tough stance because they are aware of the sacrifice. Conversely, if we have no choice but to endure and seek peace, there should also be a minimum limit, at least ensuring that the country has hope for survival. Moreover, this minimum limit of enduring and seeking peace must be clearly understood by the people, who must share the burden of all humiliation and hardship. If the people do not have this understanding and this determination to take responsibility, then the so-called enduring and seeking peace is nothing more than training to be slaves of a conquered nation, so what is the point? (Asked) Mr., you have spoken in detail about this fundamental policy. However, it is difficult to decide whether to let go or to stop the direct actions of students and the public in various places. What do you think would be the best way to handle it? (Answered) I believe that this kind of movement should not be suppressed but must be guided well. The current diplomatic relations are serious, and the people are enthusiastically concerned, which is natural. On the government side, the people should also have the opportunity to participate in this major plan of war and peace. If suppression is carried out, making the people feel as if their eyes and ears are covered while sitting in a boat in turbulent waves, not knowing their own destiny, it will inevitably provoke resentment from the public. I believe that the public's enthusiastic concern for national affairs is a manifestation of the people's progress. Those who advocate democratic politics are precisely seeking it. At this time, it is best to ask various mass organizations to elect their own genuine representatives to form a representative conference of mass organizations. Whatever the name, as long as they are representatives of genuine mass organizations and not government puppets or representatives manipulated by traitors, they can be the best mechanism for communicating the will between the people and the government. In this way, the government can report the diplomatic situation to the public through this mechanism within the possible scope, and the public can also consider various situations to contribute their responsible opinions to the government. In this way, the government and the people can truly cooperate to confront foreign countries in a unified manner, not betraying the enthusiasm of the people and realizing a good training in democratic politics. I believe that this proposal to organize a representative conference of mass organizations is the most important method to deal with the national crisis at present.</p>
<h3>The Youth Aid-to-Ma Troupe, Blocked, Set Off on Foot Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Arrived at Zhenru at Noon and Stayed Temporarily at Jinan University</p>
<p>Scheduled to Continue Marching Forward on Foot Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The youth's self-organized troupe to aid Ma Zhanshan in the Northeast to resist Japan, after holding a solemn and tragic rally at the North Station with people from all walks of life in Shanghai, set off amidst tears, vowing never to return alive, which was truly an unprecedented feat. Later, because the railway bureau was ordered to prevent the train from leaving, they set off on foot yesterday morning, arriving at Zhenru and resting at Jinan University. The troupe is scheduled to continue marching forward on foot tomorrow morning. However, yesterday's passenger train was blocked because of this. The details of the matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Set off on Foot The troupe members totaled more than two hundred and seventy people, all of whom purchased group tickets in accordance with the regulations. The railway bureau prepared one third-class carriage and one freight car the night before, originally scheduled to depart on the Beijing-Shanghai express train at 11:45 p.m. the night before. Later, because the railway bureau was ordered by Chairman Chiang to send He Yingqin, Chen Xizeng, and Jiang Yi to dissuade them, but to no avail. The Sixth and Seventh Companies of the Third Battalion of the Righteous Army of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the Righteous Army of the Second Regiment, all in military uniform, lay down on the tracks in front of the passenger car, preventing the train from moving, until the troupe started walking this morning at ten o'clock.</p>
<p>Wholehearted Farewell The head of the troupe, Zhang Shaojie, and the deputy head, Song Yihen, were ordered by the railway bureau to prevent them from taking the train. They had no choice but to abandon the luggage they were carrying in the train, wearing only a few thin clothes. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, they returned the group tickets they had purchased and led the entire troupe to line up at 10:30 a.m. and set off from the North Station on foot along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Fan Kexun and Cheng Gengnong, more than a hundred members of the Righteous Army of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, all in military uniform, followed the troupe to bid farewell. Although it was drizzling along the way, the order was very good. They arrived at the drill ground at 4:00 a.m. the day before and had not slept until 10:00 a.m. yesterday, but their spirits were high and they showed no signs of fatigue. They arrived at Zhenru at 11:05 a.m.</p>
<p>Jinan University's Enthusiastic Feast The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Jinan University in Zhenru admired the troupe members' fearless spirit and determination to go to the Northeast to assist General Ma Zhanshan.</p>
<p>They purchased a large number of steamed buns, cakes, pancakes, and tea, etc., to welcome them at the Zhenru Railway Station, and invited all the troupe members to rest temporarily at Jinan University. So they all went to Jinan University to stay temporarily. The Anti-Japanese Association also held a banquet in the Jinan University dining hall at 6:00 p.m. yesterday. The passenger train was blocked. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway North Station's express night train at 11:45 p.m. the night before failed to depart due to the departure of the youth's self-organized troupe to aid Ma Zhanshan in the Northeast to resist Japan. Navy Commander Yang Shuzhuang and Zhang Gongquan, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Rong Zongjing, etc., who attended the Financial Committee meeting, were all blocked and returned. The express train the night before did not open to the Maigen Road Station until the troupe set off on foot at more than 10:00 a.m., and was blocked and returned. It was not until 2:00 p.m. that it was able to depart. The express third- and fourth-class train at 5:50 a.m. did not depart until 10:55 a.m.</p>
<p>The special express train at 9:30 a.m. did not depart until 2:00 p.m. The express train at 7:00 a.m. did not depart until 2:57 p.m. The slow train for the first, second, and third classes at 10:00 a.m. did not depart until 3:28 p.m.</p>
<p>Number of People Joining After the troupe arrived at Jinan University in Zhenru, a few family members of the troupe members, parents, brothers, wives, and sisters, etc., rushed to Jinan University to pull at their clothes and weep, preventing them from going forward. However, the troupe members had made up their minds and unanimously refused. Only those who were compelled by the affection of their children withdrew with tears, including Xu Qi, Li Xiehuang, Wang Bin, Wu Jiang, Wang Chengkui, Cao Qingyun, and others. And those who rushed to Zhenru to join the troupe included Wu Yuecha, Hu Yongwei, Wu Delin, and Li Jinzhi, among others.</p>
<p>Advance Tomorrow Morning A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency drove to Zhenru yesterday afternoon to visit Song Yihen, the deputy head of the troupe. According to him, the comrades have made up their minds to go to the Northeast to assist General Ma. Although the railway bureau was ordered to prevent them from taking the train, they had no choice but to set off on foot. Now, thanks to the feast of the Anti-Japanese Association of Jinan University, they are resting at the school. They are scheduled to reorganize tomorrow morning and make a concrete demonstration of revolutionary personality. They also invited Mr. Sun Mujia, an instructor at the Central Military Academy, to speak on the true meaning of the national movement. It is scheduled to march westward along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line the day after tomorrow (the 9th). They will stay in Kunshan, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuxi for one or two days to conduct social surveys and promote the essence of aiding Ma and resisting Japan. However, we have absolutely no political background this time. If the government has the determination to resist Japan, we swear to be the vanguard to seek the survival of the nation, and so on.</p>
<h3>Zhang Fakui's Telegram to the County Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Headquarters, in view of the deepening Japanese disaster, telegraphed General Zhang Fakui, requesting him to lead his troops north to aid Ma and defend Heilongjiang. Now, Zhang's telegram has been received, saying, "Publicly inspect the Shanghai County Party Headquarters. The Japanese bandits are rampant and the country is in danger. If we do not rise up to seek survival, there will be no survivors. Your telegram is flowery and encourages me to send troops on a specific date. It shows that our revolutionary comrades share the same hatred of the enemy. After being moved, I admire and comfort you even more. I am now working hard to carry it out, to fulfill my duties and live up to your expectations. Fakui bows."</p>
<h3>The Women's Suffrage Association Sends a Telegram to Comfort Shi Zhaoji</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Suffrage Association telegraphed yesterday to comfort Representative Shi Zhaoji, saying, "To Dr. Shi Zhaoji, Representative Shi, in Geneva. Since the Japanese bandits forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces, you have been on a single stage, dealing with several major powers and fighting against the cunning Japanese bandits. In the past two months, you have not humiliated the country or ceded power. The people of the country admire and admire your hard work, hoping for the final victory in diplomacy. Now, you suddenly retreat and resign, which is very surprising to us. I have heard that some people have asked you about drawing a certain place as a neutral zone and a certain place as a co-management zone. If necessary, they will withdraw from the League of Nations, etc. This is all out of patriotic enthusiasm and deep trust in your personality, and only then can they offer the most sincere words to contribute questions. This is precisely the backing for you internally and externally. As for the weaknesses of compromise, neutrality, and co-management, who proposed them and when they came from, women and children all know the source of the disaster. At this critical moment of life and death, who can be relied on to save us? The people of the country have no choice but to beg you and will never blame you. The truth will come out, and Yue and Qin will be judged. Please work hard to move forward, with the spirit of this Prime Minister's diplomacy, and do not imitate Yuan Cao's traitors who sell the country. Then the four hundred million compatriots swear to fight for national dignity to the death. Sir, strive hard! The Chinese Women's Suffrage Association Committee bows respectfully."</p>
<h3>The National Goods League Opposes Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>Telegraphed Yesterday Asking the Government to Reject</p>
<p>The National Goods Promotion League Committee telegraphed yesterday to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, General Commander Chiang, Vice Commander Zhang, and Foreign Minister Gu, resolutely rejecting direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. The telegram said (omitting titles), "The violent Japanese are rampant, invading our country, destroying world peace, overturning the Non-War Pact and the Nine-Power Pact, and damaging the credibility of the League of Nations. They are truly enemies of mankind, arousing public anger in various countries. All negotiations should seek fair and reasonable solutions under the fair support of friendly countries. Now, I have heard that Japan has proposed direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, and the authorities in our country are inclined to agree. This is not only a cunning plan by the Japanese and Chinese traitors, but also tantamount to an alliance under the city. Under coercion, there is a danger of bowing to acknowledge any conditions. That is, Minister Shi's struggle and negotiation at the League of Nations, General Ma's sworn resistance in Heilongjiang, and the enthusiastic national mood of the people of the whole country to resist Japan and save the country, maintain world covenants, and the spirit of courage for peace will all be in vain. Thinking of this, how can we not be heartbroken? The Third Eighth Executive Committee of the affiliated association has decided that no resolute conditions will be accepted. I am hereby instructed to telegraph to the heads of the departments to consider the relationship between survival and death, and to implement the original intention of revolutionary diplomacy. Please follow public opinion and adopt it. The Party and the country are fortunate, and I cannot bear to wait for orders. The National Goods Promotion League Committee, the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, the Shanghai Machine-made National Goods Factory Joint Association, and the Shanghai National Goods Factory Joint Association bow respectfully. Yu Yin."</p>
<h3>More Than Seventy Labor Unions in This City Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Telegraphed Chairman Chiang Not to Recognize Direct Negotiations with Japan</p>
<p>Issued a Declaration that Capitalists are Using as an Excuse to Oppress Workers</p>
<p>More than seventy labor unions in this city, including the postal service, water and electricity in various districts, cotton spinning, shipbuilding, cigarette manufacturing, and publishing industries, held an emergency meeting at 7:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. First, Fu Dewei, the representative of the Beijing Petition, reported on the process, and then began to discuss important issues such as the current situation and diplomacy. The following resolutions were passed on the spot: (1) Telegraph Chairman Chiang to go north immediately to recover lost territory by force and oppose direct negotiations. (2) Issue a declaration that capitalists are using the national crisis as an excuse to oppress workers. The telegram to the National Government and the declaration are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the National Government To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, I am deeply shocked that it has been rumored that you agree with the League of Nations Council's designation of Jinzhou as a neutral zone, and that you have automatically proposed international co-management of Tianjin by the League of Nations. There are also rumors that our government is inclined to direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. The people of the whole country are deeply shocked. Your Excellency has repeatedly announced that the government has a final solution and will never lose any power or territory, and will never sign any treaties that cede power and humiliate the country to live up to the expectations of the people. If the aforementioned are the government's final solutions, they will only promote the realization of ceding power and humiliating the country. It is indeed a great puzzle to the national people's groups and they swear not to recognize it. Today, relying on everything is not enough to rely on. We can only urge your Excellency to go north immediately to recover lost territory by force. On the one hand, supervise Minister Shi and Foreign Minister Gu to uphold the demands of our national public opinion, preserve our territorial integrity, and protect our national rights. The telegram is urgent, and I cannot bear to look forward to it. The various labor unions in Shanghai, leading more than 800,000 workers, bow respectfully.</p>
<p>Declaration to All Newspapers and All Sectors of the Country Since the Jinan Incident, compatriots across the country have been moved by righteous indignation, vowing to sacrifice their spirit and seek loyal unity. This is indeed the expression that our citizens should have for the country and is their unshirkable duty. However, recently, a small number of factory owners, ignoring the righteousness, have repeatedly used the national crisis as a talisman, not hesitating to use the old tricks of oppression, either closing factories and laying off workers, or dismissing workers on the pretext. The closing of the Daxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory for no reason, and the large-scale layoffs of workers by the Dadong Bookstore and other disputes are too numerous to mention. Although our party and government authorities have repeatedly issued orders, the capitalists still obey and reach up, which eventually leads our workers into a situation of hardship and helplessness. Alas, our workers are facing a national crisis, and their suffering has reached its extreme. They are oppressed by ruthless capitalists. May I ask how big the world is, where is there a place for our workers to stand? Our association has always advocated peaceful national salvation. For the capitalists' unwarranted closure of factories and dismissal of workers, it not only harms the workers, but also destroys the party and the country. In addition to submitting a request to the party and government organs for fair restraint, we hereby solemnly declare that we hope that people from all walks of life will unanimously advocate, and this declaration is hereby made on December 7 by the various labor unions in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Gu Replies to the Jiangsu Elders' Telegram</h3>
<p>Ma Liang and other Jiangsu elders received a reply telegram from Foreign Minister Gu yesterday, which said, "I have respectfully received your telegram, and I am extremely grateful for your kind admonition. I have been serving in diplomacy with my humble talents, and my long-standing purpose is to protect national rights. As long as there is a breath, I will swear to persevere. Recently, I have been ordered to serve in a time of crisis, and I am even more aware of my responsibility for the rise and fall of the country. Regarding the Jinzhou issue, I have detailed the government's instructions to Representative Shi. Regarding the Tianjin issue, it is also seen in the news released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Today, they have all been disclosed in the newspapers. I hope you will appreciate it. From now on, I will continue to uphold international justice, swear to save the crisis, do my best, and fight to the end. If things go against my wishes, I will only retire and never disappoint you and cause shame to the elders. I am honored to be taught and supervised, and I dare to express my foolish sincerity. Gu Weijun bows respectfully."</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Replies to the Shanghai Yousheng Discrimination Telegram</h3>
<p>Gu replies to the Shanghai friends' telegram, saying, "Since I took office as Foreign Minister, it has only been a week. All the negotiations I have handled have followed the established policies of the government and the Foreign Affairs Committee, and it is not something that I can handle alone. I have received your inquiries, and I hereby reply as follows: (1) Jinzhou is only a corner, and it is not related to the survival of the entire Eastern Province. Our country is preparing its strength on the one hand to defend itself, and on the other hand, it is still using diplomacy to protect its territory. Therefore, around the 20th of last month, when the Japanese army was approaching Jinzhou and it was in danger at any moment, Ambassador Shi requested an emergency action at the League of Nations. At the same time, contacts were made with the British, French, and American ministers here, requesting the three countries to guarantee that the Japanese army would not advance any further. All these measures were temporary measures, and they were all efforts to restrain the Japanese army and break their plan to attack Jinzhou. Now that the Japanese army has retreated, Japan has also requested at the League of Nations that we withdraw our troops. China's administrative organs and police to maintain local order will continue to perform their duties as before. We have refused to agree to withdraw our troops, and the point of contention at present is at this level. The so-called Jinzhou neutral zone issue in Japan is the issue of the withdrawal of troops by both sides. In our Jinzhou, not a single soldier has been withdrawn, but the Japanese army has already retreated. As for the railway area, fortunately the situation has eased slightly, and we are gradually coping with it. However, the people of the country do not understand and are full of doubts, and I am deeply moved. However, the facts are there, and there is no way to deny it. (2) Regarding the Tianjin issue, there is absolutely no proposal for co-management. Tianjin is an important rear base for Jinzhou. If there is a change, the morale of the Jinzhou army will be shaken, and it will be difficult to expect a hard battle. In addition to the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, which has twice provoked incidents, almost leading to an uncontrollable situation, the Tianjin authorities and local gentry and businessmen, in view of the other party's sinister and treacherous plots, have proposed that officials and gentry from various countries stationed in Tianjin provide assistance, hoping to temporarily help maintain law and order within a few hundred meters of the Japanese concession to curb the Japanese side's conspiracy. However, because various countries are deeply afraid of being dragged into the vortex, this matter has not made any progress. (3) Regarding the direct negotiation level, Chongguang has met with me twice at the ministry, saying that the Japanese army has retreated and hoping that our country can also withdraw its troops from Jinzhou. I rejected him, explaining our views and position, and did not recognize the need for another negotiation method. He also stated that the talks were not of a negotiation nature. He also agreed, saying that his visit to the ministry was only to explain the Japanese side's position. The Japanese side is currently negotiating this matter with the League of Nations and does not want to start negotiations with us, so that the League of Nations can find an excuse to ignore the Japanese proposal. In short, since our country has not severed diplomatic relations with Japan, we cannot prevent the Japanese envoy from coming to the ministry. Since he has come, we cannot prevent him from speaking. Since he has spoken, explaining the Japanese side's claims and views, I cannot but explain our views and observations. It is very clear that this kind of talk is not a negotiation."</p>
<h3>Continued Assistance to Ma's Military Expenses Remitted to Harbin</h3>
<p>Staff of the Consolidated Tax Bureau Donated More Than 8,000 Yuan All staff of the Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax Bureau and its affiliated agencies donated more than 8,000 yuan and telegraphed it to Ma Zhanshan. Yesterday, Ma's reply telegram was received, instructing it to be collected by the Bank of China in Shanghai. The bureau transferred all the money to the Bank of China. The two telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) Staff Comfort Telegram To Chairman Ma of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government's Traveling Camp, I have heard that the isolated army is resisting the enemy, and the whole country admires it. All the staff of the bureau and its offices are united in saving the country. They have donated a month's salary totaling 8,225 yuan to express their admiration and condolences. I would like to know how to telegraph it so that it can be received personally and avoid being claimed by others. Please reply first so that it can be remitted immediately. All the staff of the Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax Bureau and its affiliated district consolidated tax bureaus and management inspection offices kowtow, Dong Yin (1) Ma's Reply Telegram To all the staff of the Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax Bureau and its affiliated district consolidated tax bureaus and management inspection offices, I have received the Dong telegram. I am honored to be praised and thanked for your generous gift. All the soldiers of the three armies express their gratitude. The government has now moved to Hailun. Please hand over your money to the Bank of China in Shanghai for collection. Ma Zhanshan, Wei.</p>
<p>The Two Pawnshop Associations Remitted 2,000 Yuan The Shanghai Pawnshop Association and the Concession Pawnshop Association, because General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province led his troops to resist Japan without yielding or giving up, not only fighting for the survival of the nation, but also adding glory to the country, especially raised 2,000 yuan and telegraphed it to Hailun immediately, requesting General Ma to receive it and forward it to his subordinates to show condolences.</p>
<p>The Hongqingfang Public Donated and Remitted 1,000 Yuan The stores and residents of Hongqingfang on North Sichuan Road donated to General Ma Zhanshan for resisting Japan and saving the country. In addition to donating to various groups for assistance, they also initiated a public donation, personally telegraphed for remittance, as the advocacy of various neighborhoods in Shanghai, and immediately obtained 1,000 yuan, which was remitted by Citibank on the 3rd, and sent a telegram to praise General Ma for his brave battle, hoping to recover the lost land in the three eastern provinces as soon as possible. The reply telegram was received, saying, "To the Hongqingfang merchants, I have respectfully received your telegram. I am honored to receive your generous praise, but I dare not accept it. I am grateful for your reward. I hereby express my gratitude on behalf of my soldiers. The provincial government has now moved to Hailun County, and I have sent someone to Harbin to contact for transfer. I have also heard, Ma Zhanshan Yin."</p>
<p>Colleagues from the Telegraph Office Donated More Than 200 Yuan Colleagues from the Shanghai Telegraph Office decided to cut their salaries to help the military because Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province upheld justice and defended the territory, and the whole country admired him. They have now collected 264 yuan and 5 jiao and first handed them over to the Bank of China for remittance. When they have collected more, they will telegraph it successively. A telegram was also sent to General Ma, which read, "To Chairman Ma, the Japanese atmosphere is confusing. You are fighting bravely and supporting the dangerous situation, and the whole country admires you. I hope you will uphold justice and take the opportunity to strike hard. The people's hearts will not die, and there should be success. We swear to cut our salaries to help the military. We have first remitted 264 yuan and 5 jiao through the Bank of China. Please check and receive it. Colleagues from the Shanghai Telegraph Office kowtow."</p>

A telegram was also sent to General Ma, which read: "To Chairman Ma, the Japanese atmosphere is confusing, and you are fighting bravely to support the dangerous situation, and the whole country admires you. We hope that you will uphold justice and take the opportunity to strike hard. The people's hearts will not die, and there will be success.

<h3>Fundraising for National Salvation from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Minzhi School Initiates a Thrift Savings Plan:</p>
<p>Given the increasingly perilous state of national affairs, all teachers and students of Minzhi Primary and Secondary Schools have decided to start today (the 8th) to save at least a minimum of daily expenses such as transportation and snacks. Faculty and staff will contribute five cents of silver, middle school students three copper coins, upper primary students two, and lower primary students one. Immediately, a savings account will be opened at a reliable bank under the name of the "Minzhi School Teachers and Students Thrift Savings for National Salvation," with weekly deposits and announcements made, in preparation for urgent national needs. Effective immediately, those who take public transport will walk instead, and those who eat bread will eat pancakes, saving as much as possible and enthusiastically depositing savings, in the hope that all agencies and schools across the country will follow suit.</p>
<p>Request to Divert New Year's Greetings Postage to Donations:</p>
<p>Zhu Shizhi of Qingpu County writes to this newspaper in great urgency: "To the esteemed chief editor of the Shen Bao: Greetings. It is already early December, and various circles are presumably preparing New Year's cards, as usual, for social greetings among relatives and friends. However, these are not normal times. The country is in peril, as precarious as a stack of eggs. National doom is imminent. We have no time for celebrations. In my humble opinion, rather than feigning peace and forcing smiles, it would be better for each person to save the cost of New Year's cards and postage stamps and divert those funds to support the Black Dragon River troops. It would not be difficult to raise a substantial sum to boost morale, express public opinion, and demonstrate that the nation's spirit is not dead. This could truly be described as achieving multiple good deeds in one stroke. Newspapers are the representatives of public opinion, especially your esteemed newspaper, which has nationwide circulation and reaches overseas. I implore you to publish this letter, which would be like a high-pitched call to action. Patriotic compatriots across the country will surely respond. Once magnanimous gentlemen have established a systematic organization for receiving donations, I too will contribute my meager New Year's funds, hoping to avoid the criticism of being all talk and no action. Furthermore, I offer the following crude verse: 'With national crisis at hand, how can we bear to celebrate the New Year? Let printing and postage costs be fully converted into donations to support Black Dragon River troops and let us not be outdone by others. Fellow countrymen, strive together in this endeavor!'"</p>

<p>The Establishment of the Huxi Volunteer Army:</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Huxi Volunteer Army, since its initiation by Zhang Gang, Li Junfeng, Luo Zheng, and others, has diligently recruited comrades and has reached a company strength. The inaugural meeting was held yesterday afternoon, and the attendance was extremely crowded. The venue had hardly any standing room.

<p>The Petition of Overseas Chinese Representatives:</p>
<p>Xie Fuchu, Chairman of the Beiping Overseas Chinese Industrial Advancement Association and representative of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Pontianak, Dutch East Indies, presented a petition to Chairman Jiang and the Nanjing-Guangdong Peace Representatives: (To Nanjing): Respectfully submitted by overseas Chinese from Europe, America, the Netherlands, and Australia, in response to the aggression of the violent Japanese, intending to donate funds and organize volunteer armies to return to the country and serve, to save the national crisis, please grant approval and assist in the proceedings. It is noted that the success of the revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China owe much to the efforts of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese are no less patriotic than their compatriots at home, and their generosity and chivalry may even surpass them. Although they are engaged in commerce and industry abroad, and have lived in foreign lands for a long time, with generations growing up and the dialects changing completely, it might seem as if they are accustomed to forgetting their origins and neglecting their ancestors. However, foreigners treat us with divisions based on borders and prejudices based on race, treating us as slaves and livestock, with strict laws and harsh levies. The image of being left behind becomes ever more profound, and the yearning for the motherland becomes ever more intense. They constantly hope that the motherland will avenge its disgrace as soon as possible. Therefore, they have made significant contributions to the revolutionary cause, generously donating to national bonds, war expenses, flood relief, and military disasters. They have even rushed to the front lines, personally taking up arms. For example, during the Republic of China era, Commander-in-Chief Yao Yuanping led troops on the Northern Expedition, and the majority of the soldiers in his army were overseas Chinese, and their salaries and weapons were also provided by them. This is known to every woman and child in our country. During the late Qing Dynasty, when the court revived the navy, the overseas Chinese contributed millions, but Empress Dowager Cixi used the funds for the construction of the Summer Palace. After the establishment of the Republic of China, overseas Chinese also subscribed to public bonds, amounting to no less than millions. Now that the violent Japanese have forcibly occupied the border regions, and the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang are already in their grasp, how can we turn a blind eye and remain indifferent? Although overseas Chinese merchants in Southeast Asia have suffered from the effects of gold prices in recent years, and their districts have been depreciated, they still have the capacity to raise funds for the military. It is advisable for the government to declare that it will allow them to organize volunteer armies, provide their own salaries and weapons, and act as a rear guard for the government's national army, sharing the national crisis. Fuchu, bearing the responsibility of representing overseas Chinese and being entrusted by the government, understands his responsibilities and dares not remain silent. He respectfully presents his views and requests that they be reviewed and implemented, as it is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Jiang of the National Government, Cai, Zhang, and Wu, representatives of the National Government, and Wang and Zou, representatives of the Guangdong Peace Conference.</p>
<p>The Petition of the Municipal Federation:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Municipal Federation of Citizens, for the organization of volunteer armies, will begin tomorrow to petition the authorities, and the following representatives have been elected: (1) Wang Hanliang, Wang Pingnan, Jiang Junyi, Wang Zhaocheng, and Chen Duomin will petition the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau. (2) At 9:00 AM on the 10th, Hu Fengxiang and Wang Pingnan will petition Wang Jingwei and Wang Bailing. (3) At 9:00 AM on the 11th, Wang Hanliang and Wang Pingnan will petition Yu Youren.

It also organizes international correspondence, warning the League of Nations and appealing to the sympathy and assistance of the world's nations to form a united front. Each person must fulfill their duty to awaken the people and train the people, not only striving for urban propaganda to intensify the national salvation movement, but also actively working in the lower and middle-class societies of townships, schools, rural areas, factories, and the military, so as to awaken the awareness of the whole people and create the power of the entire nation to fight to the death with the violent Japanese.

<h3>National Business Federation, etc. Telegraph Request to Abolish Passed Excessive Taxes</h3>
<p>According to customs tax regulations, goods in transit are generally exempt from taxation, not to mention likin and miscellaneous taxes. Shanghai Chaoshan Maoyiji Hang Nei Yichang Hang recently reported the shipment of woolen cloth goods from Shanghai via Shantou to Siam with a unified tax document, which had been marked by the Jianghai Customs for inspection and found to be correct. When they arrived in Shantou, they were suddenly detained by the Shantou Special Tax Bureau of Guangdong Yuyuan Company, which forcibly levied hundreds of yuan in donations.</p>
<p>Yichang Shantou branch was forced to pay the donations and reserved negotiations because the shipping schedule was involved. After being reported by Lin Keshu, manager of Yichang Hang, the National Business Federation and Chaozhou Fellow Association telegraphed to Lin Commissioner of the Shantou Chao Meicui Revenue Finance and Shantou Municipal Chamber of Commerce Special Tax Bureau to return the donations and no longer have such withholding. The text of the telegram is as follows: All said that the merchant said that it had been transported to the goods, to the goods to Shantou Shantou. If it is necessary to save the money, it must be a good thing. The National Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Jiangzhe Fisheries Bureau Expand Police Force</h3>
<p>Gun Branch Has Been Issued</p>
<p>Han Yougang Returns to Shanghai to Talk</p>
<p>Han Yougang, Director of the Jiangzhe Fisheries Administration Bureau, returned to Shanghai from Dinghai yesterday on the Fuhai patrol ship. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency met him at the bureau. According to Han,</p>
<p>Piracy Situation There are about thousands of pirates in the seas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, divided into two gangs, north and south. The southern gang is near the Taizhou North Bank area of Zhejiang, with about a thousand people. The northern gang is in the areas of Tongzhou Qidong in Jiangsu Province, with no fewer than two thousand people. All the guns and weapons can be obtained from the official army by various methods, which is very painful to say. The suppression of pirates is not easy, because they are scattered in various ports, and even when they loot, they are scattered pirate ships. When the official army advances to suppress them, they escape to the ports where patrol ships cannot sail. Temporarily avoid them, or abandon their ships and land, so that the official army cannot capture them one by one,</p>
<p>Expanding the Police Force The sea area under the jurisdiction of the bureau of the two provinces is quite vast, with only four patrol ships, named Fuhai, Haiying, Biaohai, and Qingan. Each patrol ship averages about 300 tons, each ship has about 30 officers and soldiers, with machine guns, rifles, wooden shell guns, and the police force is insufficient. A few days ago, several cannons were purchased again and will be installed at the Jiangnan Shipyard these days. Earlier, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was asked to issue guns, and now they have been received. There are about a hundred of various types, and the strength is quite sufficient. The most rampant period for pirates every year is in the spring months of February and March after the yellow croaker season. Now is the winter solstice when hairtail is on the market. The bureau's patrol ships must follow and protect the fishing boats when they gather to go fishing, and they must still patrol beside them to avoid accidents. However, the speed of the bureau's patrol ships is faster than that of fishing boats, so that when each patrol ship departs at the same time as the fishing boats, the patrol ship must first reach the fishing place and then turn back to the fishing boats halfway. The boats, in this way, the fishing boats can reach the destination after two or three round trips, but the patrol ships themselves inevitably consume too much coal. Now, the plan has been to add patrol ships (sailing ships) so that they can travel at the same time as the fishing boats, without worrying about the ships being fast and the boats being slow. Since the current hairtail market has arrived, I took the Fuhai patrol ship to Dinghai Shipu and other places last month and only returned to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Continued Issuance of Maintenance Fees to Employees of the Dong Province Ordnance Factory</h3>
<p>Since the Northeast Incident, the employees of the ordnance factories in the three northeastern provinces have mostly lost their jobs and cannot maintain themselves. The Relief Committee has repeatedly sent Mr. Chen Wenkui to issue the first, second, and third batches of maintenance fees of four yuan each. Yesterday, the fourth batch was issued at the Qu Zhenren Temple, totaling one hundred and twenty-four people. Each person was still issued a maintenance fee of four yuan, and Chen Wenkui personally supervised the release, and the order was very neat. However, when it was released yesterday, it was raining and windy. Mr. Chen was quite responsible and hardworking, and Sun Xingsheng, a member of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and Gao Ziqiang, a patrolman of the Second District of the Public Security Bureau, also went to the meeting to jointly supervise the release, which has now been completed. However, it was found that the employees in distress have been living in Shanghai for a long time and it is not a long-term solution. They also publicly elected representatives to request the issuance of severance pay so that they could return to their hometowns as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Chinese Staff of the French Concession Bureau Yesterday Petitioned the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun Received and Promised to Be Responsible for Negotiations</p>
<p>The French Concession Bureau has dismissed a large number of 217 Chinese employees this time, and the Chinese Friendship Association of the Bureau has decided to assist. At 9:00 AM yesterday, more than 200 dismissed Chinese staff members went to the Municipal Government to petition, in accordance with the resolutions of the emergency meeting the day before, and elected Qiu Gaogang, Shen Caigen, Peng Quanfu, and Yang Wugang as four representatives to present and report the dismissal process. Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government received them and promised to be responsible for negotiating with the French Consul-General, and there will be a satisfactory solution in at most half a month. The petitioning Chinese staff members, believing that the Municipal Government had expressed assistance, were satisfied and returned. In the afternoon, the association again sent the above-mentioned four representatives to the six Chinese directors of the French Concession Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition for assistance, and the results were all sympathetic.</p>
<h3>Northwest Aviation Reschedules Test Flight</h3>
<p>The opening of the Northwest Airlines route from Shanghai to Ping via test flight on the 13th and from Ping to Dihua on the 15th, according to Li Jingcong, director of Eurasia Airlines, has been changed to the 15th of this month for the first test flight. Foreign director Smith will first take a car to Ping today to arrange everything, and I will fly to Ping with the pilot and driver on the 13th.

Stay in Di for about five or six days, but the flight to Daicheng Ili Store and other places has not yet been determined, probably waiting to be determined when arriving at Di.</p>
<h3>The Xinming Wheel Carrying Overseas Chinese Back Home Will Arrive in the Next Day or Two</h3>
<p>The Total Number of Overseas Chinese is About 1,400 or More</p>
<p>The Authorities Ordered the Foreign Affairs Office to Greet Upon Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhaoshangju's Xinming Wheel, after being ordered by the Ministry of Communications on the 30th of last month to go to Japan to transport overseas Chinese back to Japan, is now learned that the ship has arrived in Japan, and all the returning overseas Chinese have boarded the ship, totaling more than 1,400 people. It has already left Yokohama yesterday and sailed to Kobe and will arrive that day. If there is not much delay in Kobe today, it will leave for Shanghai. As for the settlement of this large number of returning overseas Chinese after arriving in Shanghai, it is heard that the authorities will order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai to arrange for personnel to go to greet them when the overseas Chinese arrive in Shanghai and to raise funds for temporary settlement, food, and accommodation.</p>
<h3>Exchange Brokers Discuss Ways to Maintain Public Debt</h3>
<p>The Result Is to Ask the Authorities to Maintain It Together</p>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, since the violent Japanese forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces, the financial market in this port has been greatly affected invisibly. It is learned that the exchange side, in view of the recent decline in the prices of various public debts, believes that the future is unlikely to be optimistic if methods are not found to maintain them. Therefore, yesterday, the brokerage associations of the various institutes convened a meeting to discuss maintenance methods. It is reported that the result of the meeting was to request the authorities to find ways to maintain them together.</p>
<h3>Seizure of a Robbery Case on Bansongyuan Road</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 2nd of this month, around 8 PM, within the jurisdiction of the Second District General Office of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, at No. 100, Lane 265, Bansongyuan Road, inside the Shuntaichang Rice Shop opened by local resident Bao Rongjiang, three robbers broke in. They displayed a pistol and seized eighteen dollars in silver and four pairs of socks from Bao's wife, Zhou. As they left, they fired a shot as a warning. Afterwards, District Chief Ling of the district felt deeply resentful that these robbers dared to commit armed robbery and even fire a shot as a warning in his jurisdiction, especially since he had only recently taken office. He immediately ordered detectives to solve the case within a set time. Finally, on the 24th, detective team leader Cao Jun reached, based on a secret tip from an informant, that the robbers in this case were now hiding in a house on Dallas Road in the French Concession. He was asked to quickly go and arrest them. The officer immediately led detectives to the address and arrested one person. After questioning in the district, the suspect confessed to the name Zhang Keli, a Shandong native, 25 years old. He directly admitted to gathering three people, including an old man named Huang who lived by the Gaochangmiao riverside wharf, and his companion, to rob the rice shop.</p>
<p>However, the pistol was actually purchased from the City God Temple for the price of a small triangular silver. When they robbed, Huang held a sharp knife, while he held a fake pistol. They only managed to seize four pairs of socks and no money. He begged for leniency. District Chief Ling then sent people to arrest the old man Huang, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. After questioning, the case was submitted to the Judicial Section yesterday for further investigation.</p>

It is heard that the institute can perform treatments according to the doctor's instructions.</p>
<h3>Sanyou Society Promotes Half-Milled Rice</h3>
<p>Sanyou Industrial Society has recently felt that Shanghai people are accustomed to eating white rice. Excessive pounding and grinding not only waste natural resources, but also greatly violate the principles of hygiene. After the rice is finely milled, the outer layer of nutrients (Vitamin B) gradually disappears, so people who suffer from beriberi and stomach diseases are caused by eating white rice for a long time. At this time of foreign aggression and natural disasters, it is appropriate to be frugal and prevent famine, so it immediately implements the promotion of eating half-milled rice to eliminate the impropriety of eating white rice. Considering that there is no shortage of enthusiastic comrades in society, but this kind of half-milled rice is not easy to buy in Shanghai rice shops, for the convenience of promotion, it specially prepares exquisitely packaged cloth bags for voluntary sale. The packaging method is improved (each bag contains 50 market catties, which is extremely easy to carry). When it can be purchased in ordinary rice shops in Shanghai, the company will stop selling it.</p>

<h3>Tobacco Exchange Industry</h3>
<p>The Tobacco Exchange Industry Association held an emergency meeting yesterday, chaired by Chen Liangyu. The matters discussed included: (1) The business tax of this industry has been submitted to the authorities for exemption. Now, the Ministry of Finance has replied that after the promulgation of the Business Tax Law, the central government will collect the tobacco and alcohol license tax. Except for one-tenth retained by the central government, the rest will be allocated to provinces and cities as local revenue. The collection and exemption methods for tobacco and alcohol business tax have been newly stipulated. All shops that mainly operate cigarettes or alcohol and also operate other commodities, whose main business has paid tobacco and alcohol license tax, their business tax should be excluded and exempted. As for other concurrently operated parts, business tax should still be levied in accordance with the case. According to the report, in addition to ordering the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau to comply with the above, and notifying the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, it is hoped that they will be notified. According to this approval, our industry mainly deals in tobacco, although there are other items operated, the annual amount is no more than one thousand yuan, which should be exempted according to regulations. It was resolved to submit another request to the municipal government to order the Finance Bureau to approve a uniform exemption. (2) Regarding the printing of the Huacheng Tobacco Company, after the fresh case occurred, the company had a patriotic heart and completely handed over all printing to the Chinese Tianyi and Huasheng companies. Now someone is groundlessly slandering, which is a deliberate destruction. Considering that the company is the first to promote domestic cigarettes, it is not appropriate to let it be destroyed. It was resolved to notify the industry to continue to support and promote sales. Other cases were discussed and the meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Lighterage Industry</h3>
<p>The Lighterage Industry Association held a meeting on the 7th of this month. All committee members attended, chaired by Ma Zhongxiang, and recorded by Zhu Dingxian. The resolved matters included: (1) A letter from the Chamber of Commerce requested to stop loading enemy goods on lighters. It was decided to notify the industry to unanimously refuse. From now on, it is not allowed to load enemy goods, and ten inspectors will be added to go out day and night to check. (2) A letter from the Puyi Guild stated that the sand and gravel fishing boats had joined as members, and now a small number of boats from the gang have organized a guild. The matter of how to stop it was divided into two points: (1) Request the party and government agencies to investigate whether the guild should exist and where it conflicts with this association. (A letter will be sent to the Puyi Guild to change it to the Shanghai Lighterage Industry Association Sand and Gravel Fishing Boat Gang Office, and Ye Liansheng will be appointed as the director of the gang.) (3) A letter from Ma Ziliang, the representative of the Lutang Boat Gang, requested the issuance of membership certificates and the gang's name. It was decided that the gang would be named the Shanghai Lighterage Industry Association Zhejiang Dong Lutang Gang Office. To obtain membership certificates, the firm must fill out a membership application and representative resume. After investigation, the membership certificate will be issued. (4) A letter from Xiangji and other firms stated that goods were repeatedly stolen during loading and unloading, causing unbearable losses. They requested that most firms jointly organize a boat industry joint insurance office to avoid losses for the industry. It was decided to allow the establishment according to law, and its organizational law should be submitted to the association for review and examination. (5) Ma Ziliang and others requested the organization of a "Refuse Japanese Offshore Coal Transportation Office," whose purpose is to subsidize the Chinese boatmen who withdrew from the self-owned ships of Japanese foreign firms, and to send personnel to supervise and write to the Coal Industry Association to assist in handling. It was decided to allow the organization and to write to the Coal Industry Association to assist in handling. After its establishment, special personnel will be dispatched to supervise. (6) The dues of each firm should be paid within a limited time. It was decided to allow payment within five days.</p>
<h3>New Drug Industry</h3>
<p>The New Drug Industry Association presented to the Ministry of the Interior yesterday, stating that it felt that the "Regulations for the Management of Prepared Medicines" and the "Regulations for the Management of Drug Dealers" were difficult to implement and requested the Ministry to approve amendments to facilitate their implementation. It was found that when the rules were promulgated in the 19th year, the association felt that these rules were quite contradictory to the business habits and academic theories of drug dealers. Based on the facts, it proposed opinions and requested the former Ministry of Health to revise and supplement them before implementing them. The approval stated, "All submitted documents have been noted. After reviewing the points listed, although some are due to misunderstandings or are not permitted by administrative procedures, the rest are based on academic theories or facts and can be used as references to facilitate implementation. Please inform." Because of this approval, our health authorities have sincerely cared for the situation and considered the difficulties of merchants. In addition to collecting opinions from the national industry and preparing to send personnel to submit them during the amendment and participate in the meeting, the association can only wait for the early realization of the amendment of the rules. However, after more than a year, the points that hindered and contradicted the rules have not been improved in any way, and the order for the immediate implementation of the Prepared Medicines Rules has been promulgated, and the implementation of the Drug Dealer Management Rules is expected to follow. The association believes that whether to extend the deadline is not essential. If the shortcomings can be corrected, it is willing to promote the early implementation of the entire sound management rules with the spirit and strength of the group. However, before the rules are improved and still need to be amended, the association dares not silently follow them. Therefore, on the 26th of the previous month, it wrote to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, reporting the situation and requesting the Ministry to approve the amendment of the rules together, and temporarily suspend their implementation before the amendment. However, the Ministry's approval was not obtained. The association believes that the implementation of a law is related to commerce and people's livelihood, which is of great importance. At the beginning, it is appropriate to broadly cite and examine details to ensure its soundness. It was solemnly stated in the document presented to the former Ministry of Health that the formulation of laws and regulations is not absolutely unchangeable. Even if the legislative authorities exhaust their fairness and talent at the beginning of the formulation, they cannot foresee its drawbacks, which have already been seen. It is also impossible to amend them repeatedly. Now, the rules for the management of prepared medicines and the management of drug dealers, where the leniency is not achieved and it is difficult to implement, the association has already presented them to the authorities and approved them at the beginning of their promulgation. Moreover, the last article of each rule is attached with the regulation that "if there are any shortcomings in these rules, they may be amended at any time." This means that the possibility of amendment has been clearly determined, and the procedure for amendment is not contrary to administrative procedures. One year is not enough. However, knowing that it must be amended, they insist on promoting what cannot be implemented before the amendment, leaving a painful experience, causing millions of drug merchants and people to feel uneasy, which is not the beautiful intention of our wise government. We have always admired the Ministry's concern for the commercial situation and its willingness to listen to the following words. We implore you to quickly convene a meeting of the various management rules of the pharmaceutical industry and allow the association to send personnel to participate in order to achieve perfection and facilitate early implementation, which would be a great benefit. Respectfully presented to the Minister of the Interior of the National Government.</p>

<h3>Pharmaceutical Industry Union</h3>
<p>The board of directors and supervisors of the Pharmaceutical Industry Union held a meeting yesterday, chaired by Sang Yutang.

<h3>A Message to Readers and Correspondents</h3>
<p>To Open a New Path for Boycotting Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Many readers have written about boycotting Japanese goods. Many feel that treacherous merchants who privately import and sell Japanese goods are everywhere, and they cannot deal with them. They are angry and ask for solutions, especially in the inland areas. Please give me your opinion on this point.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the most difficult problem to deal with in boycotting enemy goods has been the issue of treacherous merchants privately importing and selling them. Some say that under the nationwide anti-Japanese fervor, there are still treacherous merchants privately importing and selling, which is the fault of those who have not promoted and guided effectively. Their argument is correct, but the reality is difficult. Even with the popularization of Japanese national education, part of Ma Zhanshan's military equipment was privately purchased from Japanese merchants, which was clearly revealed in the Japanese newspapers in Dalian. It can be seen that merchants value profit over righteousness everywhere. If there is no appropriate solution to this point, the boycott of goods will be fundamentally impossible.</p>
<p>Therefore, correspondents have put forward various suggestions. Some advocate burning the goods after they are found. Some advocate detaining the treacherous merchants. Some advocate parading them to show humiliation. The most radical advocate openly or secretly killing them.</p>
<p>The world has evolved to this day, and countries stand side by side. Everything must be viewed from an international perspective. To gain a position in the international community, one must first have the qualifications of a civilized country. The so-called civilized country must have a universally accepted legal system, where the rulers execute the law and the ruled abide by the law. Only by gaining the sympathy of various countries can one gain a position in the international community. The above-mentioned methods of dealing with merchants who privately sell enemy goods are indeed satisfying, but what about the national law?</p>
<p>If you don't want to break the law, you can't deal with merchants who privately import enemy goods, you can't boycott goods, and you can't save the country. What can you do? Then please solemnly reflect on whether you truly love the country and want to save it. You can only prepare to accept the judgment of the court. Please excerpt the current Criminal Law of the Republic of China as follows:</p>
<p>Article 157. Anyone who publicly punishes and uses violence or coercion, and those who assist in the scene, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year, detention, or a fine of not more than 300 yuan. The instigator and the person who actually uses violence or coercion shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than six months and not more than five years.</p>
<p>Article 286. Anyone who kills someone on the spot due to righteous indignation shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than seven years.</p>
<p>Article 316. Anyone who illegally detains or deprives a person of their freedom of movement by other means shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years, detention, or a fine of not more than 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Article 318. Anyone who uses violence or coercion to make a person do something they are not obligated to do or obstructs a person from exercising their rights shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than three years, detention, or a fine of not more than 300 yuan.</p>
<p>The ordinary methods used by various parties to deal with merchants who privately sell enemy goods now generally violate the criminal law as above.</p>
<p>Do you truly love the country and want to save it? Why not confess to the court?</p>
<p>Article 38. Anyone who confesses to the relevant public official about a crime that has not been discovered and is tried shall have one-third of the punishment for the confessed crime reduced. The same applies to those who confess to the victim, the plaintiff, or the person with the right to claim, and are tried by the relevant public official.</p>
<p>Please state one more fact:</p>
<p>Ge Yunting, Yang Haichang, Shi Xinmin, and Ju Zongyan, from the inspection department of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association, inspected the Daqing Yarn and Cloth Store and found Shiquan brand yarn and cloth yesterday, sealed and impounded them. They were prosecuted by the police to the Special Zone Court. Criminal Judge Zhou Han sentenced Ge and the other four to a fine of 20 yuan each for jointly using violence and coercion to make people do things they were not obligated to do, with a two-year suspended sentence. This was reported in this newspaper on November 26.</p>
<p>These four gentlemen, Ge, Yang, Shi, and Ju, and Judge Zhou, are all worthy of our respect. Truly for saving the country, and inspecting enemy goods, the four gentlemen, Ge, Yang, Shi, and Ju, can serve as a model for the general public, because they love the country and still do not abandon the national law. Sentencing according to the law, considering that the cause of the crime was out of patriotism, both leniently sentencing and granting a suspended sentence, Judge Zhou can truly serve as a model for the general judges, because he loves the country and still does not abandon the national law.</p>
<p>Dealing with enemy goods, dealing with merchants who privately sell enemy goods, and all judges being like this, from now on, opening a new path for boycotting enemy goods, what harm is there to national morality or national law? But it must be solemnly stated that the investigation must be accurate. If anyone is falsely accused, whether intentionally or unintentionally, it is not tolerated by law and is not allowed by morality.</p>
<p>Wang Tongjun's inquiry (inquiring about the total amount of donations)</p>
<p>This time, students from various universities in Shanghai initiated a donation campaign to support General Ma Zhanshan, suspending classes for three days. No less than ten schools participated, and many people enthusiastically contributed. The results must be considerable. However, the donation has been going on for more than half a month, but the total amount has not been reported. Whether it has been remitted to General Ma, or whether there are other measures, has not been disclosed. This really cannot help but make people doubt. Such obscurity is difficult to make the community believe. How can we face General Ma Zhanshan? I am also one of the donors, so I specially submit this letter to your newspaper to ask questions on my behalf. I hope the Student Union will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the Yangtze River basin and Shandong are cloudy with fog or intermittent rain. The area south of Ma'anshan Island is cloudy. There are strong northerly to easterly winds on the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. The center of the hurricane moved to within 120 miles of the intersection of 12 degrees north latitude and 114 degrees east longitude at around 11 AM and is moving westward. Also, within the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 59.7 degrees, and the lowest was 54.1 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 58.1 degrees, and the lowest was 39.6 degrees.</p>
<h3>Letters Received</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>After reading the letter published in your newspaper on the 6th, in which Chen Yafu requested a correction regarding the incident in which the Righteous and Brave Army Committee sent Wang Cheng and Tong Xianglong, and others, to surround the First Regiment Headquarters, many of the statements are inconsistent with the truth. I hereby clarify as follows: (1) The transfer of officials is the right of the committee, not something that one person can arbitrarily control. The official document ordering the regimental commander to hand over the command on that day was issued by Chen Yafu alone, using the name of the Organization Section, which was a forced handover and not done in the name of the committee. (2) Chen Yafu said that he had resigned from the committee and had not attended meetings. Why is Chen's name used on the official document? Is it that Wang Chengzhi and Tong Xianglong are borrowing Chen's name, or is Chen aware that he has done something wrong and is covering it up afterward? It is truly puzzling. I hereby clarify to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Ye Zhao, December 6th</p>

<h3>Recollections of Dai Liang</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>The violent sun occupies the three islands of Japan, arrogantly considering themselves the masters of East Asia. However, upon examining their population and their decadent customs, there are things that cannot be described in words. Cherry blossoms are considered the national flower of that country. Every spring when the flowers bloom, men and women frolic under the flowers, and the elegant stories of picking orchids and giving peonies are often heard. My friend Mr. Zhu is indeed a handsome young man with a dejected air. He studied in Japan and entered the Faculty of Law and Political Science for nearly two or three years. After class, he returned and exchanged pleasantries with Yaozi, the daughter of the innkeeper, and was inseparable. They progressed from friendship to a pledge of love. Writing poetry in the green window, the intimacy of the mandarin ducks was indistinguishable. Adding fragrance to the red sleeves, the harmony of the phoenixes could be predicted. Before long, they planted jade in Lantian, and unexpectedly had a son. The joy of the boudoir surpassed even drawing eyebrows together. How could he be content with one success and shifted his love to Xiao Yu, achieving two successes with one arrow. Yaozi and he shared the spring colors equally. Over the years, Mr. Zhu returned to his country after completing his studies. That beauty actually followed him without giving up and came to his hometown. She washed her hands and made soup, serving her parents-in-law with utmost devotion. Before a month passed, the son born to Yaozi suddenly died. In addition to grief, there were often excessive actions. Zhu was enthusiastically patriotic and was a veteran member of the League, rushing around and had no time to care. Those sister flowers suddenly had different ideas, rolled up everything and escaped. Ten years of affection were paid to the flowing water. I am afraid that the Eastern Foreign History failed to fully describe the situation. May ordinary young students who are addicted to Japanese flowers take Zhu as a lesson from the past.</p>
<p>I don't remove the weeds in the garden, a conversation from Zhai Fu</p>
<h3>Franklin (5)</h3>
<p>One of the Biographies of Little Apprentices</p>
<p>Franklin only began his study of electricity at the age of forty. In 1746, a man named Spence came from Scotland to Boston and showed him some electrical tricks. Franklin found them very interesting, but unfortunately, Spence was not an expert and didn't perform them very well. After returning to Philadelphia, Colinsson, a member of the Royal Society of London, soon sent a glass tube to his library company. Franklin then used this glass tube to repeat the electrical experiments that Spence had not performed well. Before long, he became an expert in these experiments. Many friends asked him to be their teacher. He set up a glass tube manufacturing room and blew some glass tubes to distribute to his friends, so the number of people who could play these electrical tricks increased day by day. Among them was a man named Kinnersley, who was unemployed at home. Franklin advised him to perform electrical experiments everywhere and earn a living by collecting lecture fees. Franklin wrote the scripts for the performances. At each lecture, the audience was very enthusiastic. One of the scripts was titled "The Sameness of Lightning and Electricity," which he sent to a friend in London. The members of the Royal Society laughed and put it aside. But Colinsson eventually had it printed, publishing five editions. Soon it was translated into French, Italian, German, and Latin, becoming very popular for a time and becoming the only masterpiece of electricity at the time. The French scientific giant Nollet opposed Franklin's new theory, but Dalibard and DeLor, in 1751, based on the experiments suggested in Franklin's writings, drew lightning into the ground in Marly to prove the correctness of Franklin's theory. Parisians flocked to Marly to see this groundbreaking experiment, and from then on, Franklin became the leading authority on electricity at the time.</p>
<h3>Describing Our Country's Heroes Who Unyieldingly Defended Their Territory (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Yan Liheng, also named Yingzhi, was from Tongzhou, Shuntian. In the fourteenth year of Chongzhen, he served as the registrar of Jiangyin County in Suzhou. Later, as the roving bandits rose up like bees, he lived in seclusion on Shishan Mountain in the county. When the Southern Ming Dynasty fell, various prefectures and counties defended their territories independently, raising militias to protect themselves. In the Biyou year, the Qing issued an order to shave hair. A student named Xu Yongde led the masses to advocate righteousness. For a time, tens of thousands of people eagerly joined him. Chen Mingxuan was in charge of military affairs, Shao Kanggong was the general, and Zhou Jinglong anchored at the mouth of the Yangtze River to support each other. Before long, the Qing army pressed down on the city. Cheng Bi, a Huizhou native, dispersed his family fortune of more than 25,000 taels of silver to provide provisions and asked Wu Zikui, the general of Wusong, for assistance. At that time, Chen Mingxuan and Shao Kanggong had been defeated, and Zhou Jinglong had also suffered a loss at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The situation was very critical. It was probably in the first ten days of the intercalary June. Chen Mingxuan was anxious, so he announced to the crowd: "My wisdom and courage are really not as good as Yan Liheng. The responsibility of defending this territory belongs to none other than Mr. Yan." So he rode a horse in the dark of night to welcome him. Yan then volunteered and led forty members of his family to go. Upon entering the city, there were few remaining soldiers and a shortage of provisions. He had no way out. As a last resort, he first measured the land. Later, he ordered each household to contribute one adult male, with the remainder providing meals. Finally, he persuaded the wealthy families to donate funds, rice, cloth, and anything else that could be used. He also stored all the gunpowder made by Qian Hualong in the parapet. Thus, the precarious city, which seemed impossible to defend for even a day, was able to be defended. However, the enemy had already surrounded the city from the outside. Those who pressed against the base of the city numbered no fewer than 100,000. But Yan ordered a firm defense, using iron sheets to wrap the door panels and iron hoops to protect them. Inside the city, earthen ramparts were built. Bundles of straw were made into the shape of people, with a lantern on a pole, set up to lure the enemy. By dawn, countless arrows had been obtained. Among the Qing soldiers was Liu Liangzuo, who was originally familiar with Yan. He sent a message wanting to see him. Yan then ascended the city wall and replied: "You have followed the bandits. What face do you have to meet with me?" In the end, he did not yield. And Jiangyin, although a small place, held out until it was conquered by the Qing after more than eighty days. All this was due to the efforts of Yan alone. Compared to those who fled at the first sign of the enemy, as if going away first was a way to win the people's favor, they are truly shamed to death. Huang Tao'an, named Chunyao, courtesy name Yunsheng, was a native of our county. He was a student. In the Renxu year of Chongzhen, he was recommended to the local area. After becoming a Jinshi, he observed politics in the Metropolitan Procuratorate. He returned without seeking an official position. Initially, he and Lu Yuanfu and others formed the Straight Talk Society to communicate their opinions. In the Jiashen year, the capital fell. Prince Fu was enthroned. All the Jinshis were granted official positions. Tao'an alone avoided them. In the Yiyou year, the Southern Ming Dynasty was once again broken. At the time, the city in his hometown was also in danger, and the situation seemed impossible to defend. Tao'an and his younger brother Yuanyao planned to defend it. So he and Hou Tongzeng and others gathered more than a thousand scholars and commoners to confront the enemy. Before long, it fell. Tongzeng drowned in Xuan's family pond, but did not die. He stood in the water and sighed: "Death is also a great difficulty." Later, he died as a martyr. Tao'an knew that the overall situation was over. He entered the Xilin Temple to commit suicide. A monk named Wudeng said to him: "You have not served as an official. Why should you die?" Tao'an said: "The city is destroyed, and I will be destroyed with it. How can I have two minds about where I stand?" So he asked for a pen and wrote: "On the fourth day of the seventh month of the first year of Hongguang, Jinshi Huang Chunyao committed suicide in the West City Monastery. Alas, I could not promote the establishment of the dynasty when I advanced, nor could I keep myself pure and secluded when I retreated. I have read books to little avail and have not achieved success in learning the Way. I am restless and sleepless. This is my only intention. If the enemy's atmosphere is restored in the future and the Chinese people see the light of day again, those who discuss their generations should know my heart." After writing, he looked at his younger brother, who was already hanging on the beam. Tao'an looked up at the roof and sighed, then hanged himself next to him. He was forty-four years old at the time. The blood from his mouth sprayed on the wall and flowed onto the stone. To this day, it is still faintly visible when the sky is overcast and rainy. It is called "Leaving Green." It is said that his spirit has not disappeared over time. Before Tao'an was in the capital, when he saw the list of those who had passed the imperial examination, the top three were always listed first. People would often sigh and express their admiration. Tao'an sighed endlessly at this, saying: "There is naturally one person in several thousand years or several hundred years in the world. Today's people are unwilling to be that person, but must be one of the top three every three years. Why?" Yuanyao was just over twenty years old. Upon hearing the news of the troubles, he immediately learned archery and swordsmanship and read the books of Sun Wu. He also generously proclaimed his ambitions. Alas, at this time of violent Japanese invasion, if one does not defend and save oneself, how can one survive? I hope that all those with a little blood and spirit will uphold this determination, worship the heroes of the past, and strive for the final victory.</p>
<h3>World News in Brief</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>A Minute of Darkness. Arguably the greatest great man in the world was the recently deceased American inventor, Thomas Edison. Whether it was Washington or Napoleon, they only contributed to their own countries and were of no benefit to other countries and people. Only Edison benefited the people of the whole world. Every night when we work under electric lights, we should think of this great inventor. This time, in order to mourn him, the United States completely turned off the electric lights across the country for one minute at 10:00 PM on the eve of his funeral. From the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast, it was a world of darkness during this minute. Even the famous Statue of Liberty's electric torch held high in her right hand was pitch black. At that time, some neurotic people were deeply afraid that during this minute of darkness, those fearless thieves would engage in large-scale activities and use their petty thievery skills. However, mourning this great inventor is something that everyone feels in their hearts. Therefore, this minute of darkness passed safely, and nothing happened. The police authorities across the United States breathed a sigh of relief and calmed down.</p>
<h3>Remarks by an Englishman</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Zhong studied in England. He recently wrote a letter describing how Chinese students in England held an anti-Japanese rally in London on a certain day last month. Professor Mala Jia of the History Department of Cambridge University in that country also attended the meeting and gave a speech. Her words were very cautionary and sincere. Those who heard it were moved. Mr. Zhong also recorded her speech and showed it to me. I am now relaying it here to share with the people of the country.</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Suppose the Japanese have occupied Manchuria for a long time and do not withdraw their troops, and are endangering the interior of the country. At this time, what kind of thoughts do you have? I think you will definitely be angry and return to your country to form groups to fight the Japanese to the death. I admire these thoughts very much. They are also rare in your country. But from my point of view, I am afraid it will still be of no help. Because the people of your country can only seek short-sightedness when they act righteously. They cannot kill the enemy and be brave. They only have thoughts about personal advancement and retreat. They have no concept of national survival and interests. From my historical perspective, such as the end of the Ming Dynasty, there were not a few people who died for their country and were loyal. Some closed their doors and committed suicide. Some jumped into rivers and wells. Some even scolded the bandits and died. None of them fatally wounded the enemy. What benefit is this to the country?</p>
<p>Moreover, every person who dies is one less person who can kill the enemy. It does not benefit one's own country, but benefits the enemy. The people of my country, England, will never have such thoughts or actions.</p>
<p>I will now give another example to prove this. Please don't blame me. I read "The Ten Diaries of Yangzhou" and "The Massacre of Jiading." I deeply lament that the Chinese race is born to be eliminated. At that time, there were still 800,000 people in Yangzhou City. The Qing soldiers numbered no more than a few thousand. Two people could fight one person. They could kill 400,000. Even if ten people fought one person, they could kill 80,000 people. At that time, people's hearts were scattered, and they still hoped to escape death. They only thought about fleeing like rats and rabbits. They did not think about gathering a large group and defending against the enemy with one heart. When the knife was at their heads, they could only stretch out their necks to be stabbed. Therefore, there were often groups of several thousand men and women who were driven by one soldier like sheep and pigs. No one dared to utter a sound. People are not cattle, horses, cats, or dogs. How could they be tamed to such an extent? In today's world of great powers competing and natural selection, can the earth still allow this race to occupy a place? If you are filled with righteous indignation and are willing to sacrifice your lives to save the country from destruction, I dare to tell you frankly, you must not die for personal advancement and retreat as before. You must die for the survival and interests of the country. To die for personal advancement and retreat is to die as a commoner. To die for the survival and interests of the country is to die as a national without shame.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that you study hard and ask questions diligently, and strive to become world-class scholars. You come to study in order to seek knowledge, and you all want to study hard and ask questions diligently to become world-class scholars. But when it comes to the survival of the country, I don't want you to only focus on your studies and ignore national affairs. There are few enlightened people in your country. You all bear a great responsibility to your country. If you don't ask about national affairs, who else will ask about them? Fortunately, there is nothing wrong. While you are studying here, you should also pay attention to the spirit of martial arts, so that you can be a student and also have the qualifications of a soldier. Your country is accustomed to being weak and considers holding weapons a disgrace. This is also one of the reasons for the country's destruction. Unfortunately, if China and Japan were to break apart, it would be too late to wait until you have completed your studies. I advise you to return to your respective provinces, form groups, protect your own land, and do your best to resist the Japanese, so that everyone can kill the enemy and be brave, and have the determination to sacrifice their lives, break their families, and not lose their land. Then, although your country has 400 million people and is very poor and weak, who can destroy it? I sincerely hope that your country can become independent, so I can't help but speak to you too sincerely. Please think about it carefully.</p>
<h3>The Death of Zhimo (5)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>"This trip of mine is really worthwhile. Haisu, would you like to come to my house to talk for a while?" Zhimo said in the car. We talked all the way to Foch Road. Because I was going to Hangzhou the next day, I insisted on going home. He and Wenbo got out of the car. I never saw him again.</p>
<p>The next day, I took the express train to Hangzhou. In Xiashi, I met Zhimo's father, Mr. Shenru. He talked to me about Zhimo and about their family matters. We talked all the way to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Everyone, I love West Lake. I have been away from it for five years.</p>
<p>During my trip to Europe, I also painted in Switzerland for six months. I also love the changeable Lake Leman very much. Now I have come to the tranquil West Lake again. If you ask me which one I love more, it is difficult to answer. Lake Leman is extremely magnificent. It is surrounded by towering snow-capped mountains. I love its mystery and greatness. I am willing to bow my head to it. West Lake is tranquil and elegant. It is dotted with Su Causeway and Bai Causeway. I love its exquisite humor. This may be too abstract, but I can only use the painter's brush to describe them. This time I went to West Lake and painted for five days. For no reason, it aroused my infinite sadness. On November 20th, I went to Dingjia Mountain with Zhou Bichu and Yan Kechang to paint. I witnessed the desolation and ruin of a day garden. I thought of Mr. Nanhai, and I couldn't help but lean on the window of the Kai Tiantian Room, shedding many sad tears in the wind. That night, I went back. Two places invited me to dinner, Yan Ci and Lin Fengmian. I first went to Mr. Yan's place and had a few drinks. Before long, Jiang Jinglu came to urge me to go. He said, "Mr. Lin lives in Banshan. I'm afraid you don't know the way, so I've come to take you there in person." I thought this was really too much. I immediately rushed back to the hotel. Mr. Jiang and others were already waiting at the gate.</p>
<p>"Have you read the newspaper today?" Mr. Jiang asked as soon as he saw me. I said I didn't have time. Has Heilongjiang fallen? He said yes. But there is something else that will make you even sadder. Your friend Xu Zhimo burned to death in a plane crash. When I heard this sentence, it was like a bolt from the blue. My whole body was ice cold. That night, I tossed and turned, extremely sad and painful. The next day, I first returned to Shanghai. I first went to Wengzhou Villa to find Wang Wenbo. I knew that Zhimo's death was no doubt. Later, I went to Zhimo's house again. It was just tragic silence.</p>
<p>My heart is broken. I finally feel that from now on, I have lost a confidant. I deeply realize the desolation and isolation in the universe. (The End)</p>

<h3>Sharing the Same Hatred (5)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Drums of Yuyang</p>
<p>A night of artillery fire awakened many people from their sleep and shattered the courage of many. Some of the civil and military officials in City S were like frightened birds, flying away far away. Some had already become prisoners, confined horizontally. Inside and outside the city had entered a state of chaos. Everywhere, only soldiers of the Sun Country were seen, carrying guns and weapons, majestic and high-spirited, their faces full of murderous intent. They were all demons who killed without blinking an eye. It was pitiful that the people of City S, although they offered no resistance, had unknowingly lost many lives. Because they had occupied City S, they searched everywhere, looting along the way. At this time, the lives of the Chinese people were worthless. If they were killed, they would be considered bandits involved in riots. Outside the east gate of City S, there was a patriotic university. It was the most valuable university in the area, famous far and wide. The principal, Xiong Feng, was also a military man, young and handsome. He donated his family property to found this university. Because he saw that the Sun Country was pressing closer step by step, advancing steadily, and that the great rivers and mountains would be slaughtered and taken away by them, could anyone with a heart not sigh? Empty words of patriotism would not help the matter. So he established this school and implemented military education to create talents who would become pillars of the country in the future. The school had all kinds of new firearms, and there were two airplanes for practicing aviation. The teachers hired were all experts with rich military knowledge. There were also more than a thousand students in the school, both male and female. Among the female students, there were many like Hua Mulan and Shen Yunying. But some students could not endure the training and hardship, and most of them dropped out halfway and ran away from school. Those who stayed in school were all young people with perseverance. Therefore, this school can be said to be unprecedented in China. If all universities in the country had this kind of practical military training, as long as it reached 50% of the patriotic university, the students would be patriotic and have strong bodies and noble wisdom. Once the country was in trouble, they could serve the country. Therefore, the people of the Sun Country were very jealous of this school, and also had a three-point fear of it. Therefore, under his oppressive power, a large number of soldiers from the Sun Country surrounded the Patriotic University. The students in Patriotic University already knew about this alarm. Several enthusiastic young people were very willing to fight to the death. But their side was not an army after all. Moreover, under the order of no resistance, they did not dare to start a war lightly. They had no choice but to disperse and seek their own way.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Standard Declines Incessantly</h3>
<p>Another Drop of Thirteen Taels: Yesterday, the gold standard repeatedly trended downwards, the market was sluggish, but rises and falls were erratic. Throughout the day, there were review-related reasons of ten taels outside, and in general there was a continuation of a loss of thirteen taels. People's hearts were not settled, and it ultimately headed toward the virtual. Supply was felt to be exceptionally complex. It initially showed itself as weak. This was because the silver market rose the day before. Moreover, there were conferences by American silver mines and India and others to raise silver prices, especially due to the unfavorable current situation. Subsequently, the downward trend grew greater, breaking 690 taels. Afterwards, large firms repurchased, using various methods to raise the price, saying it was related to swap transactions. Almost all foreign exchanges, both official and unofficial, were loosened. Then it turned level. Subsequently, the gold market again emerged within a range of ninety taels, and the market was high and low, the undulations were not small. As for advance and retreat outside the 90 tael level, the remittance market was loose and excessive. Subsequently, sellers exceeded the norm. It was only 87 taels and some change. Opened Seven Taels Lower Early in the morning, the price dropped seven taels and seven qian, calculated at six hundred and ninety-three taels. Large bars of silver again increased by sixteen and three-eighths of a cent, American silver increased by three-quarters of a cent, and overseas there still wasn't a solution regarding Japan. Because of this, people's hearts inclined toward divination. Next, when small retail clients entered the market slightly, the price was immediately raised three taels, to ninety-six taels. Unexpectedly, Fuchang, Yongfeng, Qianchang, Xiangyuan, Maoyong, Yongtong, Taichang, and small retail clients sold one after another. The price then fell another eight or nine taels. It was only for a moment, with increases and decreases of one or two taels. As for the English gold bank, it initially entered the market at eleven pence and one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five ten thousandths, and subsequently three thousand one hundred and twenty-five ten thousandths. At about twenty minutes past nine o'clock, it was eighty-seven taels. Before long, it returned to two taels in general, calculated at eighty-eight taels, seven or eight qian. The English gold official price was announced, showing an increase of a half penny, American gold was also only half a yuan. Therefore, the exchange rate continued to shrink without stopping. Therefore, the price retreated to eighty-seven taels and two qian. Afterwards, Fuchang, Yongfeng, Yuanmaoyong, Yuicang, Yongheng, and others pursued entry. HSBC and Mai Jiali bought January English gold at three thousand one hundred and twenty-five ten thousandths, Mitsui absorbed American gold at thirty-two yuan and three hundred and seventy-five ten thousandths. Therefore, they already yelled up seven taels. At twenty minutes past ten o'clock it was ninety-four taels five. At this time, Tongtaichang, Qianchang, Xiang, Daxingyong, etc. suddenly had sales. When they again suppressed it by five taels plus, at thirty minutes past ten o'clock it was eighty-nine taels. Subsequently, large firms re-entered the market, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Hongkangyong, Richang, Hengyu, Hengchangyong, Yuankangxiang, and Wanxingshunli and others were all happy to purchase. English gold could be sold at three thousand one hundred and twenty-five ten thousandths, and those settling accounts were active, calculated at one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five ten thousandths to two thousand five hundred ten thousandths. The market suddenly presented a favorable image, rising directly and soaring as much as nine taels. However, it only circulated around one or two taels, and until half past eleven it reached ninety-eight taels. Afterwards, selling clients were not idle. Because the exchange rate seemed flat, English gold could settle at two thousand five hundred ten thousandths. Moreover, because the Mumbai telegraph rose eight annas, the price could not be maintained. At thirty minutes past eleven o'clock it was ninety-two taels and eight qian. It again rose to ninety-five taels and five qian. However, the market closure was still ninety-four taels. Overall, people's hearts were confused. The quoted price was 768 taels, with a discount of eighty taels to seventy taels.</p>
<p>The late market advanced and retreated around the ninety-tael mark, and the second half of the market opened at ninety-three and a half taels. From two and a half to four and a half taels, Yuan Chengyong, Dadecheng, Wanxing, etc. sold off, and British gold was strong, one month at three seven five, three months at three one two five, so it again retreated to ninety taels zero one qian. After entering the market, HSBC absorbed three months three one two five, and the bank inter-traded one month US dollars thirty-two yuan three one two five, and the Yu He, Yuan Mao Yong, and goods hedging businesses came in, and climbed upwards to ninety-five taels at three o'clock. Unexpectedly, the sellers again saw activity, and because Mumbai was again eight annas larger, it immediately fell by six taels, and was eighty-nine taels at fifteen minutes past three. Suddenly the Dalian gang and Tongtai Chang and others chased the purchase, and immediately went out of ninety taels, and was ninety-three taels seven qian at thirty minutes past three, but the situation was not good, people were panic-stricken, especially since British gold turned loose, and all those who bought from the bank had to calculate half a penny, thirty-two and a half US dollars, transactions were sold, Daxing Yong, Yuanmao Wanxing, Juchang Richang, Yifeng and other companies tended to supply, so the price once again fell into a state of fatigue, a drop of six or seven taels, From thirty minutes to forty minutes past four o'clock, there were ups and downs of two or three taels, and then suddenly it was eighty-seven taels, and then added one tael at the time, and when it was thirty minutes past four o'clock, the closing price was eighty-seven taels eight qian, and continued to trade to seventy-eight taels, compared with last Saturday (according to the listed price), a drop of twelve taels and nine qian, had dropped four days in a row, a total of about twenty-nine taels, According to the maximum price of ninety-eight taels all day long, the minimum price of eighty-seven taels, there was a difference of eleven taels, the commodity morning market was ninety-three taels and five, and the afternoon closing price was four taels and five, and the afternoon was three taels and five, and the closing price was eighty-eight taels, and the quoted price was 75 taels to 80 taels, and the registered account was 90 taels to 94 taels in the morning, and 84 taels to 88 taels in the afternoon, with a make-up water of 90 taels in the afternoon 84 taels, and a red stripe was calculated plus six taels. The transactions are very lively, and the transaction statistics on the table are smooth. Wanxing, Richang, Hengchangyong, Futaiheng, Hengxing, and Yifengyong are all entering, and the rest, Dataifengyong, and Dadecheng enter and exit again, Yuantai, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, Hongkangyong, and Yuanmaoyong enter and exit suddenly, and are quite lively.

The total sale is four to five hundred strips, and in the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong, Hengxing, Zhifengyong, Shunli, Wanxing, and Tongtaichang are all entering.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Steps Backwards</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed price has already lengthened by two steps. Because yesterday's silver market has risen, and the British and American exchange rates have repeatedly fallen, the British gold has lengthened by half a penny, calculated as one shilling and ten pence and seventy-five ten thousandths, and the US dollar has only increased by one yuan, to thirty-one yuan and two hundred and fifty ten thousandths, and Hong Kong has decreased by a small amount of one hundred and twenty-five ten thousandths, calculated as seventy-six taels and three hundred and seventy-five ten thousandths. The rest have changed and lengthened. It is almost the actual transaction market of the bank. Initially loose, then flat, and then showed itself as withered, especially in the afternoon, the results are greater than last Saturday, calculated as British gold lengthening by 75, and US dollars lengthening by 625, due to the small exchange rate. As for the gold market, the repeated falls have not stopped, and it has broken through the 690 taels, Overall, the domestic and international situation can't be optimistic, and there is also the issue of the United States proposing silver prices, so it is ultimately difficult for people's hearts to persist, and Chinese merchants have made some connections, calculated that English gold has completed more than 200,000 pounds, and the Japanese merchants sold and HSBC brought it in, so it has already turned to selling to the gold gang, because Chinese merchants do not trade with Japanese merchants, The accounts were transferred, and Fuchang and others came out first and then came in. Moreover, a telegram from Mumbai purchased several tens of thousands of pounds, and then bought US dollars in the afternoon. As for the gold shops, they also entered into settlement, but the numbers were not many, approximately thirty to forty thousand yuan, and the market has recently loosened.</p>

<h3>Silver Loan Rates Hit Another Peak</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Over the past week, silver loan rates had gradually eased, settling the market sentiment. Consequently, the market atmosphere became peaceful. However, yesterday, Monday, upon banks opening, news suddenly emerged of substantial cash withdrawals. Furthermore, money shops all indicated that due to the year-end settlement period, the lack of capital was severe, and interest rates naturally returned to normal, leaving no surplus. Therefore, the situation tightened again, and silver loan rates rose once more. However, this minor fluctuation is not expected to cause significant disruption and should not shift the overall financial dynamics.</p>

<h3>Security Public Bonds Fall Again by Around Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday (7th), the situation of various bond markets at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. Spot trading opened with a variety of offerings, and transactions were not quiet. The futures market, however, remained sluggish. Although prices fell sharply, there were only sporadic transactions, and the buying and selling sentiment was as calm as before. Due to adverse diplomatic news, general market confidence was weak. While major players maintained a good attitude and did not sell off large amounts, the financial sector also remained relatively calm. However, there were many willing sellers, but buyers were very cold and demand was increasingly scarce. Therefore, the prices of various bonds, except for a slight rebound in spot and futures customs duties, saw declines, with the spot price of the 1929 Bond falling by 3.5 yuan, the spot price of the 1931 Bond falling by 3.1 yuan, and the spot price of the Consolidated Tax and Disbandment Bond and the December futures of the 1929 Bond each falling by 2.56 yuan. Other bonds decreased by varying amounts of one or two yuan. Even the 96 Bond fell by a small amount of half a yuan. The overall trend of the securities market appears to remain weak. The total value of spot transactions for the day was 50,500 yuan, with futures transactions totaling 3.84 million yuan in the morning and only 1.7 million yuan in the afternoon, for a total of 5,575,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Perspectives on Maintaining the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Recently, the most important issues for the industrial, commercial, and other sectors in this port are the Sino-Japanese negotiations, followed by the endless decline in bond prices. The latter is particularly relevant to investors in the financial sector and is currently the focus of attention from all parties, yet no proper solution has been found. A brief description is given below.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the Chinese government has issued bonds worth over 700 million yuan that are currently circulating in the market. This does not include those issued previously in the North, such as the 96 Bond. From past experiences, the government has attached importance to creditworthiness, and the results have been quite good. General investors in bond trading have gradually become interested, and the financial market has indeed occupied a very important position in recent years. However, since this summer, due to many domestic troubles, prices have declined, albeit gradually. Unfortunately, after the Japanese army's unreasonable occupation of Northeast China in September, the diplomatic situation became serious, and the threat of war was imminent, leading to panic and an unprecedented crash in the bond market. Prices continued to plummet by more than 30 yuan within a few months, putting significant pressure on the financial market.</p>
<p>The fluctuations in bond prices are related to a wide range of factors, from the government's domestic and foreign policy decisions to general social and financial changes, as well as tax revenues and good or bad harvests. All of these can affect the bond market. China is currently facing unprecedented floods and foreign aggression, and market confidence is extremely weak. A bond market with greatly reduced purchasing power and oversupply is an inevitable trend. How to plan to ease the market and boost confidence requires a comprehensive approach and substantial maintenance. Empty words are no longer helpful. If one is more inclined to one side, it will only make people more uneasy and lose their trust.</p>
<p>In terms of the maintenance efforts over the past two months, it can be said that all parties have indeed made considerable efforts, such as the exchange increasing margin requirements, the financial sector conducting purchases, and allowing pledges. All of these have achieved temporary results. However, in the past two weeks, the handling has not been entirely satisfactory. For example, setting the price on November 24 as the standard price, the minimum price limit, and absolutely prohibiting new sales were temporary measures taken by the exchange, which are difficult to criticize. However, the basis for setting the standard price is unclear. In reality, a bond price increase of 80-90% is not considered high, and the current decline has its own reasons. This regulation only makes people more uneasy and may even lead to a more serious situation, disrupting the financial market. If the actual price falls below the limit price in the future, the market will be unable to settle, and buyers can use this as an excuse to abandon the goods. According to yesterday's news, there are also plans to further maintain bond prices by requiring all public bond trading to be conducted with cash and spot goods, without allowing empty speculative transactions with a small amount of margin. It is also stipulated that the lowest bond price should not exceed the lowest standard of November 24. If the price falls outside this range, trading can be suspended at any time. So the so-called standard limit price is still as stable as before. As for the statement that empty speculative transactions should not be made with a small amount of margin, this directly conflicts with the exchange law. Article 28 of the exchange law clearly stipulates futures trading. If all transactions must be conducted with cash and spot goods, why have the futures trading provisions? This violates both fact and reason. If implemented, it will only increase disputes and uneasiness in the market.</p>
<p>But in fact, the securities market has reached its most critical stage, and it is imperative to find ways to provide relief. The ways to provide relief, stabilize confidence, and encourage investment are the most urgent tasks. The government should reform politics, achieve peaceful unification, handle diplomacy well, and prevent foreign aggression, which would be the best policy. Secondly, within the possible range, find ways to reduce debt, order the national financial sector to consider investment, and formulate reward and punishment measures (at present, in the financial sector of this port, in addition to acting as a bond margin, the bond holdings are heard to be not much. Other ports are even worse). If the forces are concentrated, it is not difficult to stabilize confidence, raise market prices, and achieve the actual effect of maintaining. For the exchange, on the one hand, allow free trading to show creditworthiness, and on the other hand, may increase margin requirements and restrict speculation. All the minor regulations that can make people more uneasy and cause future disputes should be eliminated, and close supervision should be followed (Wu).</p>
<h3>The Yarn and Cotton Market is Extremely Bearish</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak again, with a particularly sharp decline. The disturbances in the Northeast and the increasingly serious situation have led to weakened market confidence. In addition, there is large-scale selling, and actual sales in the market are becoming more sluggish. All groups have no extremely large sales. However, recent changes have been too great, and the rise and fall are too volatile, so the future may see a rebound.</p>
<p>This month's futures prices fell by 3.8 taels. The opening of the human standard forward market was flat for American cotton, and the selling pressure was particularly strong in the market. Near months fell by 3 taels, and far months fell by 1.1-1.2 qian. In the afternoon, the near months fell by another 8 qian, and the far months rose by 1.2-3 qian. The total volume of transactions for the day was 45,000 bales. It was found that 1,300 bales of Mingde were sold, 1,050 bales of Tianlong were sold, 2,100 bales of Rongxing were sold, 2,500 bales of Changfeng were sold, and 1,200 bales of Yiyu were sold. 5,500 bales of Taixing were bought, 4,250 bales of Gengfeng were bought, 1,450 bales of Dafu were bought, and 1,300 bales of Yuda were bought.

<h3>The Cotton Market is in the Gloom</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat and weak, with a very bleak trend. American cotton is sluggish, but Indian cotton is trending upward due to crop failures. However, various factories are buying a huge amount of foreign cotton, and there are very few problems with domestic cotton. However, since the country has suffered floods, the source of goods from Hankou is scarce, so the bulls are holding on tightly. The overall situation is still softening, and the price of 31.2 taels is feared to be hovering for a long time.</p>
<p>The Hankou Standard is flat and soft. The Hankou Standard's market sentiment softened due to flat American cotton, rising Indian cotton, and weakened gold prices. Each month fell by 1-2 qian. In the afternoon, the near months rose by 1 qian, and the far months rose by 0.5-2 qian. The total volume of transactions for the day was 63,900 dan. It was found that 5,900 dan of Tianjiang were sold, 5,900 dan of Ruiyuan were sold, 1,800 dan of Jifeng were sold, and 2,600 dan of Yichang were sold. 7,500 dan of Gengfeng were bought, 1,400 dan of Taixing were bought, 1,200 dan of Yifeng were bought, and 1,300 dan of Yuanda were bought.

<h3>Indian Cotton Continued to be Firm Last Week</h3>
<p>A telegram from Bombay on the 5th reported on the cotton market during the week: The local cotton market continued to be firm last week. The slow arrival of new cotton on the market limited short selling. Moreover, due to the extremely low inventory, holders were asking for prices at will. Furthermore, the sharp fall in the gold pound price made cotton sellers even more reluctant to abandon their goods. Oomra demand was active, so prices were very firm. Europe had a fair amount of inquiries for spot goods, Fair Dholleras and New Tinnies. There was also some trading with Japan. The raw cotton statistics for the week are attached below:</p>
<p>Last Year December This Year November This Year December</p>
<p>(Ending on the 4th) (Ending on the 26th) (Ending on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Total Arrivals Since September 1st 362 154 179</p>
<p>Total Exports Since September 1st 512 258 273</p>
<p>Exports to Europe 129 53 55</p>

<p>Exports to Japan 282 105 115</p>
<p>Exports to Other Regions 5 16 16</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 426 375 363</p>
<h3>The Grain and Rice Market is Firm</h3>
<p>There were not many arrivals from various groups in Nantou yesterday. Retail sales in cities and towns of selected top-quality rice were slightly active. Medium-quality goods seemed slack. Due to a light rain in the morning, the customer side once bid up, and thick Xin Geng rice increased by a few cents. Although there was a large inventory of thin rice, sales were the smoothest, and prices were firm. Yang Du Jian rice saw some activity from customer groups, and the market was stable. There was a shortage of old and broken goods, and prices rose by one jiao. The market for moldy Yuan Wei rice was still good, and the market was showing a strong trend.</p>
<p>Yesterday, about 30 boats of goods arrived at Xin Zha from Changshu, Wuxi, and Qingjiao. Sales in this street were sluggish at first and then became active, making the market difficult to predict. Changshu Wuxi Bai Geng rice saw slight fluctuations. The opening price of ordinary goods was set. Nangang early and late rice prices rose and fell slightly, and the buying sentiment was not weak. One load of Yang Du Jian rice arrived yesterday and was sold out, so the price rose by a few cents. The total volume of goods from rivers and factories in the city was about 5,300 to 5,400 shi.</p>
<h3>Northern and Hankou Groups Trial Handling of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>The current sales of foreign rice are booming... There was also a transaction of forward foreign rice.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market turned active. Because this street continued to handle new foreign rice, and new Northern and Hankou groups were trying to handle the packing in the market, the market sentiment was optimistic, and prices were slightly strong. Small Jiaomi was offered at 4,000 bags, priced at 10.1-9.88 yuan, and No. 1 Saigon at 500 bags, priced at 11.25 yuan. Xinmi, a customer specializing in Xian rice, offered 800 bags of newly arrived Wenzhou rice, priced at 11 yuan for top quality and 9.82 yuan for second quality. In the forward rice market, Hubei rice was offered, and foreign firms continued to sell. Anli had a transaction of 1,700 tons of small Jiaomi in February, priced at 4.57 taels, and Tamsu had a transaction of 3,000 tons of small Jiaomi in April, priced at 4.85 taels, all of which were bought by this street.</p>
<h3>Distant Month Flour Mills Trend Lower</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the flour market in various months trended towards sluggishness. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat had rebounded, the current unsettled situation and the decline in actual sales made the market sentiment waver and difficult to maintain. It was found that the major mills have all automatically decided not to add additional costs for the current month's standard, allowing customers to draw and套套, and the ample supply of flour is not difficult to imagine. Therefore, the market was stable in both the morning and afternoon. For the distant months, various mills have a large number of offerings. The buyers who have to 進近出遠業外were hit, so the distant months fell, making it difficult for the bulls to operate again. Looking at the later stages, although the near term feels stable, the difficulty of the later stages cannot be avoided. As a result, the current month was down 0.25 cents compared to the previous weekend, January was down 0.75 cents, February was down 1.25 cents, March was down 2 cents, and April was down 2.25 cents. The Flour Exchange has set the date for the solar calendar settlement to be the 25th of this month.</p>
<p>The market will be closed from now until the end of the month. The market will reopen as usual on January 4 of next year. The market has already announced this.</p>
<h3>The Forward Wheat Market Enters a Sluggish State</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the forward wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market in various months generally showed a flat and sluggish trend. Due to the poor environment, market confidence was flat. In addition, it was not long before the end of the solar calendar year, and everyone had to close their books. The general inland groups were not as active as a few months ago, so the buying sentiment was not smooth and the atmosphere was relatively weak. The manufacturers had a certain number of orders for forward foreign wheat, so the future wheat market naturally had little hope. Therefore, the later stages of the market still look sluggish. As a result, the current month was down 2 cents compared to the previous week, January was down 2 cents, February was down 3 cents, and April was down 2 cents.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silk Telegrams Still Rarely Transferred to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port still tended to be sluggish. It was found that the various European firms did not forward the telegrams sent by the Huangbai factory to overseas firms over the weekend. The attitude of European and American firms remained firm. Only Anli and others bought 20 bales of Bai Qianjing, and Kechang bought 16 bales of Huangsi, with prices remaining flat.</p>
<h3>New York Cantonese Silk Prices Still Firm</h3>
<p>High-quality new-style factory silk is priced at US$1.90.</p>
<p>Recently, New York silk factories have been advocating for cost reductions due to sluggish silk sales. They have no appetite for high-priced silk. The Cantonese silk market has always been on par with the Japanese silk market, and factory purchases are still active. Prices remain firm, with high-quality new-style white factory silk priced at US$1.90 per pound, equivalent to about 700 taels of Chinese silver (price per 100 catties).</p>
<h3>The Tea Market is Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port remained quiet. High-quality Zhenmei green tea and Fagu green tea from Wuyuan were still sluggish. Only Yihua and Yulong bought 98 boxes of Zhenwei Zhenmei green tea and Zhenmei green tea, with Zhenmei priced at 115 taels and Zhenmei priced at 40 taels. There were no other transactions.</p>
<h3>Hardware English Steel Plate and 폭板 at 3-4 Qian</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been extremely quiet recently, but arrivals are plentiful and market confidence is weak, so prices have generally fallen. The recent decline in English steel plate has been more severe than others, due to the influence of abundant stocks. The outbound traffic is quite scarce at this time of national chaos. Because the industry is eager to sell, prices are falling further. Currently, the market price for 2.5 Li per dan is only 8.56 taels, 6.1 taels, 7 Li is flat at 5.34 qian, and 1 Fen is only sold at 4.89 taels for half a tael or more. Compared to the previous market conditions, prices have fallen by 3-4 qian.</p>
<h3>Coal Market is Exceptionally Quiet</h3>
<p>The coal market was exceptionally quiet yesterday. The customers from Xiangluo have not been actively purchasing goods recently, and the local shops in this port have also been slacking off in their purchases. Therefore, the total transaction volume for the city was only about 1,500 tons. There were 305 tons of various kinds of white coal lumps, 80 tons of fines, 380 tons of bituminous coal, 525 tons of fines, and 216 tons of lumps. The market prices did not fluctuate much. However, the selling price of bituminous coal was slightly weaker. For example, Boshan Tong was 11.25 taels, Baigu Dun Tong was 13.75 taels, and Xiaoshan Tong was 11 taels.</p>

<h3>After the Economic Severance with Japan (Part 2) by Jian Ping</h3>
<p>| The Greatness of its Effect Can Be Known |</p>
<p>(5) Almost All Japanese Ships Along the Coast Are Destroyed</p>
<p>Since the boycott began nearly two months ago, the source of Japanese goods has been completely cut off, and the impact on Japanese shipping operators has been enormous. In the overseas lines, the Osaka Company first removed its Shanghai-to-Europe route and merged it into NYK, reducing more than twenty branch offices. Kawasaki's NYK Pacific routes saw each ship exporting only one or two tons of goods from Shanghai. The NYK ships on the China-Japan routes suffered huge secret losses due to the lack of cargo. The Japanese government instructed the suspension of four Shanghai-bound ships and seven Yangtze River ships (from Japan to the Yangtze River). Since the middle of last month, the Osaka Company has also suspended two Guangdong-bound ships and three Shantou-Xiamen-Fujian ships. The Dalian Steamship Company has suspended twenty-one cargo ships on the Yingkou, Andong, and Dalian routes, and four ships on the South China route. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha has also withdrawn two ships from the Shanghai-Tianjin route. NYK's five North and South Ocean liners have been ordered to reduce by three ships. It is recorded that during its most prosperous time, Japanese commercial vessels along the Chinese coast numbered one hundred and seventy or eighty, traveling between China and Japan, and various North and South Ocean ports. Since the beginning of this boycott, in the past two months, nearly ninety percent of the ships have suspended operations due to lack of business. Of the ships still operating, only eleven or twelve are barely running, mostly traveling empty.</p>
<p>(6) No More Japanese Merchant Ships on the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Merchant ships are the vanguard of developing foreign trade. Japan has always attached great importance to the shipping industry. Merchants pooled huge sums to build ships, and the government provided subsidies to encourage them. After the European war, Japan's tonnage increased greatly, rivaling England and the United States. The purpose of Japanese shipping was to seek hegemony in the Pacific Ocean in the distant seas and to seize the shipping rights on the Central American route, intending to overwhelm the United States. Therefore, on the Pacific route, in the past five years, they built new ships to compete with the American shipping industry. In the near seas, they sought to develop shipping to China, hoping to monopolize Chinese transportation and gain special influence in Chinese shipping. Therefore, in the shipping industry promotion regulations, the government gave special subsidies to Japanese shipping companies in China, intending to make all of China's merchant ships fall into the hands of Japanese merchants. They knew that our country's shipping industry was immature, ships were old, and operators only sought immediate personal gain, disregarding national transportation and the convenience of shipping. Japanese merchants saw through our country's weaknesses and took advantage of the situation. Therefore, Japanese ships in our country, whether in South China, North Ocean, Yangtze River, or inland rivers, all had their routes. What the Japanese valued most was the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River is a region rich in natural resources in China, and the Japanese must obtain raw materials from it. Moreover, the Yangtze River runs through six provinces, making it the main area for the sale of Japanese goods. When the Japanese first started shipping in China, they first operated ships on the Yangtze River, established by Osaka and later transferred to NYK. NYK made every effort to operate this route, and the freight and passenger fares they took away over the years are unknown, probably tens of millions of yuan. The magnificent building at the intersection of Five Ma Road in the Outer Bund today is only a few percent of the surplus profit they scraped away. In recent years, NYK's business has developed and surpassed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is run by Chinese. The China Merchants Bureau has always regarded the Yangtze River route as its base. Compared with NYK, China Merchants is better than NYK in terms of business, docks, warehouses, and ships. However, in terms of business and passenger/freight revenue, it is not as good as NYK. One has annual surpluses, one does not cover expenses, one builds houses and ships, and the other mortgages debts. The gains and losses in this are hard to explain. In the spring of this year, it was heard from a certain Japanese that, after many years of shipping on the Yangtze River, the Japanese had gradually achieved part of their plan. If they waited another year or two, they could consolidate their shipping position in the Yangtze River and achieve a permanently superior position. Then, through the coastal routes, they had prepared forty new-style ships and, after four years of hard work, would be able to drive out the existing old and slow Chinese ships, leaving them with no passengers or cargo. If those in charge of our country's shipping administration do not wake up early, the talk of recovering shipping rights will be just empty words. Since the anti-Japanese incident, the whole country has hated the tyrannical Japanese, and everyone has united to implement a boycott, taking economic self-defense measures. The Japanese merchant ships were the first to suffer the most serious blow. On the Yangtze River route, from Sichuan to Anhui and Jiangsu, all merchants stopped trading with Japanese ships, passenger groups stopped loading goods, passengers generally did not take them, and even dock workers went on strike. Upstream pilots refused to guide the ships. As a result, Japanese Yangtze River ships had to stop operating. The following ships have already ceased operations on the Yangtze River:</p>
<p>Changyang Maru 1,033 tons Yichang-Chongqing Line</p>
<p>Xinyang Maru 1,969 tons Hankou-Japan-Yichang Route</p>
<p>Dangyang Maru 1,573 tons Hankou-Yichang-Chongqing Route</p>
<p>Dazhen Maru 2,421 tons Shanghai-Yichang Route</p>
<p>Daji Maru 1,891 tons Shanghai-Yichang Route</p>
<p>Jialing Maru 366 tons Hankou-Yichang Route</p>
<p>Jialing Maru 366 tons Yichang-Chongqing Line</p>
<p>Yunyang Maru 1,037 tons Yichang-Chongqing Route</p>
<p>Wuling Maru 1,458 tons Hankou-Hunan Route</p>
<p>Daxiang Maru 1,643 tons Shanghai-Yichang Route</p>
<p>Dafu Maru 2,555 tons Yangtze River Route</p>
<p>Ruiyang Maru 3,078 tons Yangtze River Route</p>
<p>Fuling Maru 621 tons Yichang-Chongqing Route</p>
<p>Yiyang Maru 943 tons Yichang-Chongqing Route</p>
<p>Yuanjiang Maru 875 tons Hankou-Tongze Route</p>
<p>Luoyang Maru 4,386 tons Yangtze River Route</p>
<p>Dali Maru 2,005 tons Yangtze River Route</p>
<p>Baling Maru 2,427 tons North and South Oceans</p>
<p>In addition, there are also ocean liners such as Huashan Maru and Lushan Maru that are about to suspend operations. Upstream of the Yangtze River, there is also one Japanese ship, Changfeng Maru, which has also stopped sailing. There is not a single Japanese ship on the Yangtze River, both upstream and downstream. Even the docks and warehouses in various ports have been closed. Decades of operation have been wiped out in one day. The effectiveness of the economic severance is enormous.</p>
<p>(7) South Manchurian Shipping Is Also Completely Blocked</p>
<p>In addition to land transportation, Mantetsu also operates maritime transportation. In recent years, since taking over the Dalian Steamship Company, it has been operating passenger and postal services between Shanghai, Qingdao, and Dalian, and has opened routes in Yingkou and Andong, adding large ships and controlling operations to compete with Chinese merchants. Nine-tenths of the business in the Northeast has been taken away by Japanese merchants. The routes between Shanghai-Yingkou, Shanghai-Andong, and Shanghai-Qingdao-Dalian are almost entirely under the control of Japanese ships. Last year, they built eight giant ships of 3,800 tons each, preparing to add routes to the Shanghai-Guangdong and North-South Ocean routes. The coastal shipping rights have been seized by Mantetsu in almost all of China. This time, when the boycott occurred, Chinese merchants in Yingkou and Andong, even under the power of Japanese soldiers, refused to load their ships. Other coastal areas also broke off contact with Japanese ships. Mantetsu's two new South China routes, both the un-opened and the existing Yingkou-Andong routes, have also been suspended. According to a survey, the ships that the company suspended from mid-October include the following:</p>
<p>Anshan Maru 3,890 tons Various North Ocean Ports</p>
<p>Ichishin Maru 1,440 tons Shanghai-Qingdao</p>
<p>Kokuryu Maru 6,112 tons China-Japan Line</p>
<p>Banjin Maru 3,561 tons Shanghai-Tianjin Line</p>
<p>Shinton Maru 1,575 tons Same as above</p>
<p>Eijun Maru 2,156 tons Dalian Line</p>
<p>Sanshi Maru 3,800 tons South Ocean Line</p>
<p>Choshun Maru 2,245 tons Shanghai-Tianjin Line</p>
<p>Kairyu Maru 4,365 tons North and South Oceans</p>
<p>Koshun Maru 2,189 tons North and South Oceans</p>
<p>Toragyo Maru 3,328 tons Shanghai-Dalian Line</p>
<p>Tobatsu Maru 4,168 tons Same as above</p>
<p>Yentai Maru 3,461 tons Same as above</p>
<p>Konan Maru 3,800 tons South China Line</p>
<p>Hakushin Maru 1,482 tons Shanghai-Dalian Line</p>
<p>Kojo Maru 1,681 tons Shanghai-Qingdao-Lianyun Line</p>
<p>Manshu Maru 5,266 tons Shanghai-Dalian</p>
<p>Ryuko Maru 3,191 tons Shanghai-Qingdao Line</p>
<p>Tonan Maru 4,370 tons Same as above</p>
<p>Santo Maru 3,800 tons South Ocean Line</p>
<p>Kobei Maru 3,800 tons Same as above</p>
<p>(8) Inland River Japanese Ships Change Their Names</p>
<p>The inland river Japanese ships are under the ownership of the Daishin Chang Shipping Bureau. In the Shanghai area, there were originally Shanghai-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Suzhou, Shanghai-Huzhou, and Changshu routes. In recent years, the name has been changed to Yuantong Shipping Bureau. However, in the Hunan area, such as Dongting Lake, Xiangtan, and Changsha, there are still Daishin Chang ships, and there are docks and warehouses. Daishin Chang is the most invasive of foreign ships in the inland rivers. They also have ships in the interior of Jiangxi, Wuhu, and Anqing. Now, since the anti-Japanese incident, Daishin Chang in Shanghai immediately removed the brand name and used the name Yuantong uniformly. At the same time, Daishin Chang in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces also changed the company name to Yuantong Shipping Bureau and used Chinese names to fraudulently apply for licenses to operate. This has been discovered by the local party headquarters, which have submitted requests to the provincial governments to strictly ban them and refuse to sign ship licenses, prohibiting them from operating.</p>

<p>Youth Garden</p>
<h3>Venting</h3>
<p>— Zhen Hong</p>
<p>In the cold and quiet classroom, only a few people are sitting sparsely. It is raining outside, and a gloomy atmosphere fills the room, making everyone listless, quietly preparing their homework.</p>
<p>"Hey, how are you? Do you feel bored? The rainy weather is really annoying." Yong seemed to be suffocating under the oppression of the silence, wanting to say something, anything, to break the silence.</p>
<p>"Naturally, who welcomes rainy weather? Especially those who are cooped up in school," a voice that seemed to respond and refute at the same time said.</p>
<p>"But, let's be happy! Don't mind the rain, today is our Premier's birthday!" Wu said solemnly. "Think about it, sixty-six years ago today, our great man was born. He was also a commoner, just like us. He was also born in a time of domestic trouble and foreign invasion, just like us. But he was able to embrace an unwavering will and a fearless spirit, taking it as his duty to save the country and the people. Finally, he laid the foundation of freedom for the country and the people. And what about the youth of our time? Slogans are something we know how to shout."</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"Perhaps our shouts are even louder than those of the Premier back then. But in reality, after a while of commotion, that's it. What did we shout for? Even if we did something, look at how imposing it seems, but in reality, the only thing praiseworthy about modern youth is their mouths."</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, anyone can sing high-sounding tunes. I want to ask you, what about yourself? You're probably a practitioner, right?" two mocking voices said.</p>
<p>"There's no need to ask. I and you and everyone else are pretty much the same, as if we came out of the same mold. Who can escape this epidemic?"</p>
<p>"Oh, since everyone is the same, then no one has the right to ridicule anyone."</p>
<p>"What? Am I ridiculing? This is the truth! ... But, it's okay, when someone is bored, can't they ridicule themselves?"</p>
<p>"Being able to ridicule oneself, that's considered enlightenment, right?" someone chuckled.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. People who smoke opium don't necessarily not know that opium is poisonous."</p>
<p>"Let's not dwell on it. In short, the decadence of modern youth is a fact, undeniable." This was Li's boring voice. She pushed the books she was preparing in front of her and joined the conversation. "At first, we have sharpness, but with each setback, our sharpness decreases. In the end, we become discouraged and listless. What 'forging ahead with courage' and 'unyielding spirit' are just words... It's like waves hitting the shore. If they can't knock down the shore, they retreat."</p>
<p>"Your analogy doesn't seem right. The waves don't knock down the shore, it's true that they retreat, but they immediately surge up again, and the momentum is more ferocious with each time... Modern youth, rather than being like waves hitting the shore, are more like the receding tide, going with the flow, drifting away with ease."</p>
<p>"Oh, is that so? I don't think modern youth are that bad. What I mean is that our modern youth are not without courage, but they are too loved, they are not allowed to toil. Look, when a youth wants to develop the heat of their youth, when they want to strive, there is a kind and stern face, using a majestic and loving voice saying, 'Ah, don't move! This is useless. I love you, I can't bear to see you go astray!' So this youth, under the combined attack of kindness and majesty, has no use for his courage. If it were coercion, not allowing him to do something, then he wouldn't be afraid, because the joy of struggle and the pleasure of resistance are enough to make him disregard everything... In short, modern youth have been softened." This was another voice.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's going on? Your conversation isn't over yet?" Someone over there seemed to be annoyed. "And in your conversation, no, is it an argument, filled with a gloomy atmosphere, extremely boring. I beg you, can you not make the conversation rainy-like? Listening to this kind of conversation is like being in the rain, making people uncomfortable... Alas, this kind of gloomy weather, gloomy conversation, I really can't take it."</p>
<p>"Actually, we can't even call this a conversation. To be honest, it's just because we're cooped up in school and unbearably bored, we're just venting."</p>
<p>At this time, the sound of a harmonica came from another classroom, playing a tune familiar to everyone. So everyone unanimously opened their throats and sang along with the harmonica.</p>
